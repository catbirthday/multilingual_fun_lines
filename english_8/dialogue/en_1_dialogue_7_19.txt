=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I used to love swing dancing. Now I can't even remember the basic step.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah that's... that's tough when something you loved just kind of slips away like that. The muscle memory, it's weird how it fades, you know? But honestly, the basic step usually comes back pretty quickly once you, erhm, start moving again.

Character 1: It's been three years since Sarah left. She was my dance partner.

Character 2: [laugh loudly] Oh man, I actually remember Sarah! She had that, um, that incredible triple step, right? Though honestly, dancing with the same partner for so long and then... well, losing that connection makes everything feel different, doesn't it?

Character 1: Everything feels different. The music doesn't even sound the same anymore.

Character 2: Aah, I get that. When you associate certain songs with specific people or, like, particular moments, they become sort of... haunted? But maybe that's just your brain protecting you right now, kind of dampening things until you're ready to, I dunno, feel it all again.

Character 1: Do you think I should just give up? Find a different hobby?

Character 2: Woof, that's... no, I mean, only you can answer that really. But here's the thing—you came here tonight, didn't you? That tells me something in you still, errm, wants this, even if it's buried under all the other stuff right now.

Character 1: I came because I had nothing else to do. My apartment is too quiet.

Character 2: [frustrated] Right, so you're here to fill time, not to dance—I mean, that's fine, whatever gets you through the door! But look, swing dancing isn't just about having a partner, it's about the community, the music, the, uh, the joy of movement itself, arguably.

Character 1: There's no joy in it anymore. Just memories.

Character 2: Sheesh, okay, that's... that's heavy. But memories aren't necessarily bad, right? Sometimes they hurt at first but then they, kind of, transform into something else, something you can carry without it weighing you down so much.

Character 1: [shouting] You don't understand what it's like!

Character 2: You're right, I probably don't—not exactly, anyway. But I've seen dozens of people come back to dancing after loss, divorce, illness, whatever, and they all say it feels wrong at first, like wearing someone else's shoes or something.

Character 1: Maybe I shouldn't have come. This was stupid.

Character 2: Hang on, wait, just... give it one song, alright? Not even a full dance, just stand here and, erhm, listen to the music with me—no pressure to move or remember steps or anything like that.

Character 1: Fine. One song. Then I'm leaving.

Character 2: [whispering loudly] Oh gosh, okay, here comes "Sing Sing Sing"—this one always gets people, I swear. Just close your eyes and let it, um, wash over you, and if your feet start tapping, well, that's technically not dancing, so you're safe.

Character 1: [apologetic] I'm sorry for yelling. I just... I miss how things were.

Character 2: [upset] No, no, don't apologize for grieving, that's... Man, loss changes everything, obviously, and dancing might never feel exactly the same. But maybe, I mean maybe, it could eventually feel different but still, ehhh, still good in its own way, you know?
