=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're saying kids today don't even know where their food comes from?

Character 2: Most of them genuinely think vegetables just appear in grocery stores. I had a ten-year-old last week who didn't realize potatoes grow underground. She thought they grew on trees like apples.

Character 1: That's actually kind of depressing.

Character 2: It gets worse. When we started our school garden program, half the kids wouldn't touch soil because they thought dirt was inherently dangerous or toxic. They've been so disconnected from nature that earth itself seems alien.

Character 1: [pause] How do you even begin to fix that?

Character 2: Start small. We do taste tests first—let them try a sun-warmed tomato straight from the vine versus a grocery store one. Once they realize what they've been missing, they suddenly care about how things grow.

Character 1: Do the parents support this or do they think you're wasting academic time?

Character 2: Mixed reactions honestly. Some parents love it, others complain we should focus on test scores. But here's the thing—gardening teaches science, math, patience, responsibility. It's interdisciplinary learning at its finest.

Character 1: What about urban schools with no green space?

Character 2: Container gardens, vertical walls, hydroponic towers. We converted an old janitor's closet into a growing lab with LED lights. Where there's a will, there's absolutely a way to bring nature indoors.

Character 1: [upset] But shouldn't this be common knowledge already? How did we fail so badly?

Character 2: [apologetic] I know, I know, it's frustrating. We prioritized standardized testing over life skills. Two generations now have grown up thinking food production is someone else's problem, not something they need to understand.

Character 1: [upset] My nephew thinks chocolate milk comes from brown cows!

Character 2: [anxious] That's... that's actually a widespread belief! Twenty percent of Americans apparently think that! We've created this bizarre fairy-tale version of agriculture that's completely divorced from reality!

Character 1: What's the most shocking thing you've encountered teaching this stuff?

Character 2: A teenager who didn't know chickens lay eggs without roosters. She thought eggs were baby chickens and was horrified she'd been eating them. The basic biology knowledge gap is staggering.

Character 1: At least she cared once she found out?

Character 2: Exactly! That's what gives me hope. Once kids make these connections, they become passionate advocates. They go home and demand their parents compost, they start questioning food waste, they actually think about ecosystems.

Character 1: How long before you see real change in their thinking?

Character 2: Usually about six weeks. First they're grossed out by worms, then they're fascinated, then they're explaining vermiculture to their parents at dinner. The transformation is beautiful once they reconnect with the natural world.
