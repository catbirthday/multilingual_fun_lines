=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you've been coaching youth soccer for what, fifteen years now?

Character 2: Sixteen actually, but, uh, who's counting? The thing is, it stopped being about soccer probably around year three. Now I'm basically teaching kids how to lead themselves and each other through, you know, controlled chaos every Tuesday and Thursday.

Character 1: What do you mean it's not about soccer?

Character 2: Well, I mean, yesterday's practice—perfect example. Had two captains arguing about defensive formation, right? Instead of jumping in, I let them work it out. Twenty minutes of heated discussion, and they actually came up with something better than what I had planned.

Character 1: [frustrated] But don't parents expect you to teach actual soccer skills?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, and we do drills, we run plays, all that. But, hmm, here's what parents don't see—when their kid learns to communicate under pressure on the field, that's them learning to present in a boardroom someday. Leadership isn't about the ball.

Character 1: How do you identify which kids have leadership potential?

Character 2: Oof, that's... that's actually the wrong question. Every kid has it, they just show it differently. Some lead by example, barely say a word. Others are vocal, organizing everyone. I had this one quiet kid who became captain just because everyone naturally looked to him during tough moments.

Character 1: Do you have a system for developing these skills?

Character 2: Yeah, sort of. We rotate captaincy every month, which, er, sounds simple but it's transformative. Kids who never saw themselves as leaders suddenly have to make decisions. The confidence shift is, gosh, it's incredible to watch happen in real time.

Character 1: What about the kids who resist taking charge?

Character 2: Mmm, those are my favorites actually. The resistant ones usually care the most about not letting people down. Once they realize leadership is really about serving the team, not bossing people around, something just, like, clicks for them.

Character 1: Any memorable breakthroughs?

Character 2: Oh man, last season. This girl, Sophie, anxiety disorder, could barely speak up in huddles. By playoffs she was calling plays, motivating the team during our worst game. Her mom was basically sobbing on the sidelines watching it happen.

Character 1: How do you handle the really competitive parents?

Character 2: I tell them straight up—your kid can win every trophy and still fail at life, or lose every game and become, you know, an incredible human. Usually takes about three weeks before they stop keeping score and start noticing how their kid treats teammates.

Character 1: [whispering] What's your biggest failure as a coach?

Character 2: Lost a whole team once. Got too focused on winning a tournament, pushed them too hard, forgot everything I just told you about. Five kids quit. That's when I realized I was, um, coaching for my ego, not for them.

Character 1: [extremely happy] But you clearly learned from it!

Character 2: [gasp] The thing is, those kids taught me more about leadership than any coaching clinic ever could. Now every practice starts with asking them what they need from me, not telling them what I need from them.
