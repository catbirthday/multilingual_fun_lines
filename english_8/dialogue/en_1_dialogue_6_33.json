            "content": "Exactly! See, when they realize they're responsible for someone else's learning, it's, hmm, totally different from just memorizing for themselves. I watched this one kid who never talks basically become this passionate teacher explaining, you know, photosynthesis to his group."

            "content": "Ooh, that's where it gets interesting—I do this combination thing where, um, everyone takes an individual quiz but their grade is averaged with their home group's scores. So basically they're motivated to make sure everyone learns, not just, you know, the smart kids carrying everyone else."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Oh absolutely, that's my go-to for quick formative assessment actually. I'll pose a question, give them thirty seconds to think alone, then, er, two minutes to discuss with a partner, and honestly the quality of responses after that process is so much richer than just calling on raised hands."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[slowly] Yeah, timing is... well, it's tricky because different pairs work at really different speeds. What I've started doing is using this, hmm, flexible approach where I watch for when about seventy percent are engaged, then give a thirty-second warning before sharing out."

Technology actually makes the cooperation piece way more manageable, especially when you're, like, trying to document everyone's contributions for assessment purposes."
