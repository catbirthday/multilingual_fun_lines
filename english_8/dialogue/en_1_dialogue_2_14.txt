Character 1: Is this your first time performing at a comedy festival?

Character 2: Actually no, this is my third year running. Though last year I got bumped to the 2 AM slot right after someone who brought puppets—tough crowd after midnight puppets, let me tell you.

Character 1: [pause] Puppets? At a comedy festival?

Character 2: [excited] Oh absolutely, comedy puppets are having this weird renaissance right now! There's this guy who does existential crisis Kermit, another one with a nihilistic sock that discusses Kafka—it's simultaneously terrible and brilliant.

Character 1: [speeding up] Wait wait wait, are you telling me I have to compete with puppets now too?

Character 2: Not just puppets—last night there was a mime doing stand-up. Yes, silent stand-up comedy. The audience just sat there confused for twenty minutes while he gestured aggressively at nothing.

Character 1: [very slowly] How... does... silent... stand-up... even... work?

Character 2: It doesn't. That's the beautiful disaster of it. He got three courtesy laughs and someone threw a dinner roll at him. The roll got bigger laughs than his entire set.

Character 1: Please tell me you're joking about all this.

Character 2: I wish I was, but comedy festivals attract the strangest acts. There's someone doing mathematical humor tonight—their opener is about prime numbers dating. "Why was six afraid of seven? Because seven eight nine, but also seven is prime and therefore inherently untrustworthy."

Character 1: [sleepily] Oh god, math jokes? Really? That's what we've come to?

Character 2: The worst part is he's killing it with the tech crowd. They're eating up his binary jokes and probability puns while the rest of us just stare blankly wondering if we should laugh.

Character 1: Maybe I should just quit while I'm ahead.

Character 2: [warm] Hey no, don't say that—you're actually funny, which already puts you ahead of puppet guy and math comedian. Plus you use actual words, which is surprisingly becoming a competitive advantage around here.

Character 1: My bar is now "uses actual words"? That's depressing.

Character 2: Look at it this way—the weirder everyone else gets, the more refreshing regular observational comedy becomes. You talking about airline food might actually feel revolutionary after someone performs interpretive dance comedy.

Character 1: There's interpretive dance comedy too?

Character 2: [very meekly] I may have signed up for that workshop by accident... thought it said "interactive" not "interpretive" and now I'm committed to expressing my childhood trauma through jazz hands tomorrow at noon.

Character 1: You're doing interpretive dance comedy about trauma?

Character 2: The instructor says comedy is pain plus movement plus time. I told her that's not the expression but she just started doing this aggressive shimmy at me so I backed down immediately.
