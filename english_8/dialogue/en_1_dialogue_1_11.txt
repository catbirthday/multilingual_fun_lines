Character 1: I heard you've been working with clay for decades. What got you started?

Character 2: [high-pitched] Clay chose me—not the other way around! When I was seven, I touched wet earth after rain and understood: this material remembers everything. Every fingerprint, every intention, every... mistake becomes permanent once you fire it.

Character 1: That's a beautiful way to describe it.

Character 2: Beautiful? No no no—it's mathematical. The silica particles align at precisely 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit; the molecular structure transforms irreversibly. Poetry happens in the kiln where science and art collide at temperatures that would melt aluminum.

Character 1: How do you know when a piece is ready for firing?

Character 2: The clay speaks in moisture content: leather-hard whispers "not yet," bone-dry shouts "NOW!" Touch it with the back of your hand—cool means water remains, warm means the minerals have settled into their pre-fire meditation.

Character 1: Do you have a favorite technique?

Character 2: Raku! Oh, raku firing is controlled chaos—you pull glowing pieces from the kiln at 1,800 degrees and plunge them into sawdust. The smoke penetrates the crackled glaze creating patterns that look like lightning frozen in time.

Character 1: That sounds dangerous.

Character 2: Danger is relative; respect is absolute. Fire doesn't negotiate—you wear kevlar gloves, you move with purpose, you breathe carefully. The kiln gods demand reverence or they crack your work into a thousand useless shards.

Character 1: Have you ever had a complete disaster?

Character 2: Three years ago: forty-seven bowls, a commission for a restaurant. I rushed the drying phase by twelve hours—every single one split down the middle like broken hearts when the water expanded too quickly.

Character 1: That must have been devastating.

Character 2: Devastating taught me patience! Now I count days like a meditation: day one to three for slow drying, day four for trimming, days five through seven for bone-dry waiting. Time is the invisible ingredient nobody discusses.

Character 1: [angry] Why doesn't anyone teach that in classes?

Character 2: [clearing throat] Because... because Western culture worships speed over mastery. Japanese potters apprentice for ten years before they're allowed to center clay independently—here, people expect perfection after a six-week course at the community center.

Character 1: Ten years seems excessive though.

Character 2: Excessive? Your hands need ten thousand repetitions to understand clay's personality: how porcelain differs from stoneware, how earthenware forgives but won't survive high-fire. Muscle memory isn't built in workshops—it's earned through decades of spiral wedging.

Character 1: [enunciating every word] What would you tell someone just starting out?

Character 2: Fall in love with failure first. Every collapsed wall teaches balance; every S-crack reveals timing; every glaze disaster shows chemistry's truth. The wheel spins at sixty RPMs but mastery arrives at the speed of geology—slow, patient, inevitable.
