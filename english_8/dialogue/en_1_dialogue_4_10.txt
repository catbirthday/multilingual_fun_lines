=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I've been thinking about getting into meditation but I don't know where to start.

Character 2: Oh okay, yeah, meditation can feel overwhelming at first. The simplest way is literally just sitting for, like, two minutes and focusing on your breathing—that's it, nothing fancy.

Character 1: Two minutes? That's it?

Character 2: [curious] Mmm, why does that surprise you? Most people think they need to meditate for thirty minutes right away, but honestly, consistency matters way more than duration.

Character 1: I guess I assumed it had to be this whole big commitment.

Character 2: [fast] No no no, that's exactly how people burn out! Start tiny, like ridiculously tiny, and then maybe add a minute each week if it feels good.

Character 1: What about all those apps and guided meditations?

Character 2: Apps can help, sure, but they're not necessary. I mean, people meditated for thousands of years without smartphones, right? Sometimes simple silence is actually better.

Character 1: Do you meditate regularly?

Character 2: Erhm, I try to. Some weeks are better than others, you know? The key is not beating yourself up when you miss days.

Character 1: What's the hardest part for most people?

Character 2: [singing] The wandering mind, the wandering mind! But here's the thing—that's totally normal. Your brain will think thoughts, that's literally its job.

Character 1: So what do you do when your mind wanders?

Character 2: You just, um, gently notice it and come back to breathing. No judgment, no frustration—think of it like training a puppy, basically.

Character 1: How long before you actually see benefits?

Character 2: Hmm, some people feel calmer after one session, but real changes usually take, I'd say, two or three weeks of daily practice.

Character 1: [quickly] Wait, daily? Every single day?

Character 2: [speeding up] Well ideally yes but look if you miss a day it's not the end of the world just get back to it when you can.

Character 1: This sounds harder than I thought.

Character 2: It's simple but not easy, if that makes sense. The actual practice is super basic, but, uh, showing up consistently—that's where people struggle.
