=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I heard about what you did for the Martinez family.

Character 2: Word travels fast in this neighborhood. They needed help more than I needed that money. Their daughter's medical bills were crushing them, and I had savings just sitting there doing nothing.

Character 1: [excited] Twenty thousand dollars though! That's not exactly pocket change!

Character 2: It was my house down payment fund. Took me six years to save it, but houses will always be there. Their daughter might not have been if they couldn't afford the treatment.

Character 1: [sneeze] Sorry, allergies. You gave up your dream home for strangers?

Character 2: They're not strangers, they're neighbors. And dreams can wait—emergencies can't. Besides, what good is a dream home if you know the family three doors down lost everything trying to save their child?

Character 1: Most people wouldn't have done that.

Character 2: Most people don't realize how little separates them from needing that same help. One diagnosis, one accident, and suddenly you're drowning. I've been there before—someone pulled me out when I was seventeen.

Character 1: What happened when you were seventeen?

Character 2: House fire took everything we owned. Some woman we'd never met paid for our hotel, bought us clothes, even covered my college application fees. Never got her name—she just vanished after setting us up.

Character 1: So you're paying it forward.

Character 2: Absolutely. That woman changed my entire trajectory. Without her, I don't get into college, don't get my engineering degree, don't have savings to give away in the first place.

Character 1: [apologetic] I'm sorry, I shouldn't be prying into your personal history like this.

Character 2: You're not prying, you're curious about human behavior. That's healthy. We should all question why we do what we do, why we help or don't help.

Character 1: [singing] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound...

Character 2: Interesting choice. You know Grace isn't just about religion, right? It's about unearned kindness, giving without expecting return. That's the whole point—sacrifice isn't sacrifice if you're keeping score.

Character 1: The Martinez family wants to pay you back.

Character 2: [exhausted] I know, they keep trying. Luis came by yesterday with an envelope, Maria brings food every evening. They don't understand that letting me help was their gift to me.

Character 1: How is taking your money a gift?

Character 2: Because it reminded me why I work so hard in the first place. Not for things, not for security, but for the ability to matter when it counts. They gave me the chance to be that mysterious woman from my past.
