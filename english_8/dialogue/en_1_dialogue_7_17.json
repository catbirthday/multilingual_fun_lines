But honestly, I was mostly watching because, uh, your Velvet Underground shirt is spectacular and you were muttering about Nico's collaborations, which, I mean, that's basically my favorite conversation topic ever."

Like, the fluorescents are humming in B-flat, which is actually really annoying, and the cash register, jeez, it keeps hitting this sharp F that just... ugh. But hearing someone else who actually knows about German experimental music? That's, that's rare."

But then I kind of, well, I told Phil Spector his wall of sound was basically just organized noise, which... yeah, that didn't go over great. So now I'm here, digging through bins, finding treasures nobody else even recognizes."

We only pressed maybe, mmm, 500 copies before everything went sideways—the label folded, the producer, uh, he overdosed like two weeks after we wrapped, and suddenly it was like the whole project was cursed or something. Nobody wanted anything to do with it."

Like, we got three full minutes of music that nobody played, and it still, it still gives me goosebumps thinking about it. It's on track eleven if you've got really good headphones."

Sometimes I think, okay, maybe it's just electromagnetic interference or something, but the melody follows these, these rules that shouldn't even exist in Western music theory."
