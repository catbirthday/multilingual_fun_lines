=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you really make a living just... playing other people's music at parties?

Character 2: Oh man, it's, uh, it's way more than that honestly. I'm reading the crowd, mixing tracks live, creating this whole energy that doesn't exist without me there, you know? It's basically conducting an emotional orchestra every night.

Character 1: [slowly] But it's not real music. You didn't write any of it.

Character 2: Mmm, okay, so that's like saying a chef isn't really cooking because they didn't grow the vegetables themselves. I'm taking existing ingredients and, um, transforming them into something completely new, creating experiences that literally move people.

Character 1: My nephew wants to drop out of college to do this DJ thing.

Character 2: Ooh, yeah, that's... that's heavy. Look, I mean, I get why you're worried, but some of us just aren't wired for the traditional path, you know? The music industry is brutal but when it works, it really works.

Character 1: [belly laugh] The music industry! You press play on a laptop!

Character 2: Ha, right, I wish it was that simple. I'm managing like four different software programs simultaneously, beat-matching by ear, reading body language of hundreds of people, and essentially performing live for five hours straight without breaks.

Character 1: [regretful] I shouldn't laugh. I just don't understand this generation.

Character 2: No no, it's cool, I get it. My parents think I'm basically unemployed too. They keep asking when I'm getting a "real job" even though I'm pulling in more than my brother the accountant.

Character 1: You make more than an accountant?

Character 2: [joking] Well, during wedding season I'm basically printing money. Turns out people will pay stupid amounts for someone who can get Grandma doing the Electric Slide, you know?

Character 1: But what about stability? Benefits? Retirement?

Character 2: Yeah, um, those are... those are real concerns. I've got my own health insurance now and I'm putting money away, but it took years to get stable. It's definitely not for everyone, that's for sure.

Character 1: My nephew says you can learn it all on YouTube.

Character 2: Ehhh, technically yes, but that's like saying you can learn surgery on YouTube. The technical stuff, sure, but reading a room? Recovering from equipment failures? Building a reputation? That takes years of, uh, pretty embarrassing failures honestly.

Character 1: Maybe I should talk to him about keeping college as a backup.

Character 2: [shy] Actually, um, that's what I did. Finished my degree while DJing nights and weekends. Gave me something to fall back on when COVID basically erased my entire industry for a year.

Character 1: You have a degree?

Character 2: Electrical engineering, if you can believe it. Turns out understanding signal flow and, uh, frequency modulation actually helps a lot with mixing. But honestly? I've never once used my degree for anything except impressing skeptical uncles at family dinners.
