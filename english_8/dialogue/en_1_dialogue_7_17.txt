Character 1: [upset] That's a first pressing of Pet Sounds you're holding.

Character 2: [empathetically] Oh wow, yeah, I know! God, isn't it just... it's incredible, right? I've been, um, I've been hunting for this exact pressing for literally three years now, and here it is, just sitting in the bins like it's nothing special.

Character 1: You noticed that?

Character 2: [formal] Well, I suppose I should mention that I have rather acute hearing—perfect pitch, actually. But honestly, I was mostly watching because, uh, your Velvet Underground shirt is spectacular and you were muttering about Nico's collaborations, which, I mean, that's basically my favorite conversation topic ever.

Character 1: You could hear that from across the store?

Character 2: Oh man, yeah, I hear everything in here—it's kind of overwhelming sometimes, you know? Like, the fluorescents are humming in B-flat, which is actually really annoying, and the cash register, jeez, it keeps hitting this sharp F that just... ugh. But hearing someone else who actually knows about German experimental music? That's, that's rare.

Character 1: Are you some kind of musician?

Character 2: Was! Oh God, was I ever. I did, um, session work for years—played on some pretty wild stuff actually. But then I kind of, well, I told Phil Spector his wall of sound was basically just organized noise, which... yeah, that didn't go over great. So now I'm here, digging through bins, finding treasures nobody else even recognizes.

Character 1: Wait, you worked with Phil Spector?

Character 2: [laugh hysterically] Oh my God, you're literally holding my album! Right there, under your arm—that blue one! I played Hammond organ on track seven, and I haven't seen a copy in, what, fifteen years? This is absolutely insane!

Character 1: This is yours? I found it in the dollar bin.

Character 2: Ha! Story of my life right there, honestly. We only pressed maybe, mmm, 500 copies before everything went sideways—the label folded, the producer, uh, he overdosed like two weeks after we wrapped, and suddenly it was like the whole project was cursed or something. Nobody wanted anything to do with it.

Character 1: What's it worth?

Character 2: [very excited] To collectors? Probably nothing, but to me? Oh man, everything! That album was supposed to be my big break—we recorded it in this supposedly haunted church in Louisiana where, get this, Robert Johnson allegedly made his crossroads deal!

Character 1: [animated] Did anything strange happen?

Character 2: Okay, so this is where it gets really weird—the tape machines kept recording after we unplugged them. Like, we got three full minutes of music that nobody played, and it still, it still gives me goosebumps thinking about it. It's on track eleven if you've got really good headphones.

Character 1: You're making this up.

Character 2: No, no, I swear! I've actually got the master tapes in my apartment—been trying to figure out that phantom track for, jeez, must be a decade now. Sometimes I think, okay, maybe it's just electromagnetic interference or something, but the melody follows these, these rules that shouldn't even exist in Western music theory.

Character 1: Show me.

Character 2: Really? Oh wow, you'd be the first person who actually wanted to hear it—everyone else thought I'd completely lost it. But if you're serious, I mean really serious, bring that album and, um, whatever you know about impossible music. This could be... this could be amazing.
