=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I've been tracking the migration patterns of moths for six years. Nobody else seems to care about moths.

Character 2: That's actually fascinating though—moths are completely underrated pollinators, right? Most people obsess over butterflies but moths do the heavy lifting at night when nobody's watching.

Character 1: You're the first person who hasn't immediately changed the subject.

Character 2: Well, I mean, I get obsessive about things too. Last year I spent four months documenting every single crack in the sidewalks between my apartment and the subway station. Sometimes you just need to follow what pulls you.

Character 1: [loudly] There's a moth called the death's-head hawkmoth that can squeak!

Character 2: No way, like actually squeak? That's incredible—I bet it's some kind of defense mechanism against predators. Does it sound threatening or more like a tiny mouse?

Character 1: [upset] My ex said my moth research was pointless. Said I was wasting my life.

Character 2: Your ex sounds like someone who's never felt genuine curiosity about anything. Look, you're building a body of knowledge that literally no one else is creating—that's the opposite of pointless, that's pioneering.

Character 1: I have 14,000 photos of moths. Is that too many?

Character 2: Too many for what exactly? If you're documenting migration patterns, 14,000 might not even be enough. You probably need multiple shots per specimen, different angles, various locations—honestly, I'm impressed you've been so thorough.

Character 1: Sometimes I dream about moths. Their wings make patterns in my sleep.

Character 2: That happens when you're really deep into something—your brain keeps processing even when you're unconscious. I used to dream in spreadsheet cells when I was analyzing urban decay patterns. The patterns in your dreams might actually be your mind making connections you haven't consciously recognized yet.

Character 1: [flirtatious] You really understand obsession, don't you? That's... attractive.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Oh, I... well, understanding comes from experience, I guess. When you've spent enough time defending your own weird interests, you recognize a kindred spirit pretty quickly.

Character 1: Want to see my favorite moth photo? It's on my phone.

Character 2: Absolutely, yes. And don't just show me one—I want to see the progression, how you've refined your technique over six years. I bet your early photos versus now tell their own story.

Character 1: Most people stop me after the third photo.

Character 2: Most people are cowards who can't appreciate dedication. Show me fifty if you want—I once made someone sit through my entire collection of rust pattern photographs from abandoned buildings.

Character 1: You collect rust patterns? That's beautifully strange.

Character 2: [friendly] Hey, strange is just another word for specific, right? We should compare notes sometime—I bet there's overlap between moth migration routes and urban decay sites that neither of us has noticed yet.
