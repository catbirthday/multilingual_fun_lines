# Speaker Lines Only (English) - Actor 1
============================================================


# --- DIALOGUE ---
1. Oh! No, no, it's—sit, please. God, you look exhausted. I'm Jordan, I've been here since, uh, Tuesday? Or wait, Wednesday. The days kind of blur together here, honestly. Are you here for the whole week thing or just the weekend?
2. Oh, ha, no—this is my first time actually. I meant I've been here since Wednesday of this week. Sorry, that was... I'm not explaining well. I'm still getting used to the whole, you know, no phones, no clocks, eating in silence thing. It's really weird at first.
3. Yeah? I mean, I thought I needed it too, but then yesterday during this breathing thing, I just—I completely lost it. Like, full-on sobbing in front of strangers. The instructor kept saying it was "releasing" but honestly it just felt like, uh, really embarrassing?
4. Oh shit. Sorry, that's—wow. That's a lot. I'm here because my therapist basically said I needed to, like, "reconnect with myself" or whatever, but divorce? That's... I can't even imagine. Mine's just regular anxiety stuff, nothing that heavy.
5. Mmm, probably desperate? I mean, that's what got me here—my roommate literally drove me because she said I was having what she called "concerning thoughts." Which, okay, fair, but still. We're all kind of desperate here, I think. Have you met River yet? The guy who runs it?
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS ---
6. [quietly] Yeah, sure, whatever you think is best. [pause] I already signed the papers you sent over, didn't really read them that carefully but I trust you're not trying to screw me over or anything.
7. [bitter] Engage? Like how I engaged when you spent every weekend at union meetings instead of working on our marriage?
8. [exhausted] I did believe in it, Marcus, I really did. [sighs] But somewhere along the way, fighting for everyone else became more important than fighting for us, and I just got so tired of always coming second to whatever cause you were championing that week.
9. [very quietly] We never had kids because you were too busy organizing strikes to even discuss it properly.
10. [sadly] Maybe we both had our ways of avoiding the real conversations. [trailing off] I guess it doesn't matter now anyway, we're just two people dividing up assets and pretending the last eight years didn't mean anything...
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT ---
11. I understand your concern, and I apologize that the billing format didn't meet your expectations. Let me pull up your account using your customer ID CUS-892745-B and walk you through each line item in detail.
12. Certainly, I appreciate the time sensitivity. Your base service plan SRV-PREM-500 shows at $299.99, which includes your premium features package activated on September 15th with the standard corporate discount applied.
13. Excellent question. The first charge of $47.50 is your standard data allocation under plan code DAT-5GB-STD, the second at $22.00 represents peak-hour usage between October 5th and 12th, and the third at $35.75 covers international data roaming from your Toronto trip.
14. I understand the confusion, and you're right to question this. The peak-hour billing only applies when usage exceeds 150% of your standard allocation threshold, which happened during billing cycle BC-2024-10-A when you reached 7.8GB total usage.
15. Of course.
# --- MONOLOGUE ---
16. [confused] What's... what's going on? Why are all these people in our— [gasp loudly] Oh my god. Is this for me? This is— wait, you did this? [shaky voice] I don't understand. I thought you didn't even know when my birthday was. Hell, I thought you barely knew I lived here most days. You're always so quiet when I'm around, and we just do that awkward kitchen shuffle thing where we don't really talk and I just assumed... [pause] God, I feel so stupid now. [emotional] All those times I thought you were ignoring me, were you actually, um... were you actually paying attention? [sniffle] The decorations, the— is that my favorite cake? How did you even know that? [overwhelmed] I mentioned that like once, maybe six months ago when I was drunk and rambling about childhood birthdays. You remembered that? [voice breaking] Nobody's done anything like this for me since I was a kid. My own family doesn't even call anymore. And you— you barely talk to me and somehow you noticed more about me than people I've known for years. [crying while speaking] I'm sorry, I'm being such a mess right now. [laugh] This is the best thing anyone's done for me in... I don't even know how long. Thank you. Really, thank you.

# === REMAINING LINES ===

# --- DIALOGUE (continued) ---
17. [whispering] Honestly? I'm faking it. I have no idea what I'm doing here. This morning I accidentally went to advanced yogic breathing instead of gentle stretching and almost passed out. I think everyone here knows way more about this stuff than me.
18. Um, unexpected? I guess... okay, this is going to sound really dumb, but yesterday I ate lunch without scrolling through my phone—obviously, because they took them—and I actually tasted my food? Like, really tasted it? I know that's not profound or anything, but it kind of freaked me out how much I usually just... don't notice.
19. [furious] Beautiful? No, it's—it's fucking terrifying actually! Like, if I'm not even present when I'm eating, what else am I missing? Sorry, I didn't mean to snap, it's just... this place makes you think about stuff you really don't want to think about, you know?
20. Oh god, I have no idea. Someone mentioned it involves writing down things you want to let go of? And then there's fire? But also maybe dancing? I'm kind of nervous about it, to be honest—I'm not really a "ceremony" person, if that makes sense.
21. [sad] Not really. I mean, people are nice but everyone's dealing with their own stuff, you know? It's weird being surrounded by people but feeling so... I don't know. Alone, I guess. But maybe that's the point? To sit with that feeling instead of running from it?
22. Oh boy, um, single sign-on. Look, I've seen this go wrong so many times. The promise is great—one password for everything—but the reality is, uh, it becomes this massive single point of failure that keeps everyone awake at night.
23. [laugh] That's what they tell you! But here's the thing—when that one account gets compromised, boom, everything's gone. Plus the integration costs are, mmm, absolutely brutal. We're talking six figures easy for a decent-sized company.
24. Yeah okay, users love it initially, sure. But then your identity provider goes down and suddenly nobody can access anything—email, files, payroll, nothing. I've seen entire companies grind to a halt for hours.
25. Okta, Auth0, Azure AD—they're all fine until they're not. Remember when Okta got breached? Twice? Their whole business model is being the keys to your kingdom and they, uh, couldn't even protect themselves properly.
26. Right, I get it, but you're trading password resets for a whole different nightmare. Now you need dedicated SSO admins, SAML debugging expertise, and honestly? Half your legacy apps won't even support it properly.
27. [anxious] Oof, compliance actually gets worse sometimes. Auditors start asking about your identity provider's certifications, their data residency, their breach history... it opens up this whole can of worms you weren't even thinking about before.
28. Partial rollouts are the worst of both worlds, seriously. You're maintaining two authentication systems, users get confused about which apps use which login, and your help desk tickets actually increase for like the first year.
29. Mmm, it's absolutely terrible. Once you're integrated, switching providers means retooling every single application. I've seen companies stuck paying triple their original contract because migration would cost even more than the price hike.
30. Just because everyone's doing it doesn't mean it's smart. I mean, sure, big enterprises with dedicated teams can maybe handle it, but for most companies? It's basically paying tons of money to create new vulnerabilities.
31. Look, if you absolutely have to do it, at least keep critical systems separate. But honestly? Good password managers and proper 2FA training would solve most of your problems for, uh, like a tenth of the cost and hassle.
32. Oh yeah, absolutely! Let me just, um, flag down our server. You know, I was actually thinking about the tip—with service this good, I usually go like twenty-two, twenty-three percent instead of the standard twenty, does that sound reasonable to you?
33. Hmm, let me see here... okay so your salmon was thirty-two, my pasta was, uh, twenty-eight, and then we had that appetizer for fourteen. Plus the two glasses of wine at twelve each, that's... geez, ninety-eight total before tip.
34. Yeah, I know, restaurant prices are honestly getting a bit ridiculous these days. Actually, you know what's funny? I charge eighty-five for a full adjustment at my practice, and that's like, forty-five minutes of specialized treatment, but here we're paying more for, what, an hour of eating?
35. Well, I mean, I try to keep it accessible, you know? Most places around here charge anywhere from one-ten to one-fifty for the same service, but I figure if people can come in twice a month at eighty-five, that's better than, um, once every three months at a higher rate.
36. Right right, so twenty-two percent of ninety-eight is, erhm, let me think... about twenty-one fifty, which brings us to roughly one-twenty total. We could just split it sixty-sixty if that's easier, or we could itemize if you prefer?
37. Oh yeah, they definitely do! Actually, speaking of payment stuff, I just switched my practice to this new system that charges only two point six percent per transaction instead of the usual three point five—saves me like, hmm, probably four hundred a month in fees alone.
38. [apologetic] Sorry, I'm totally doing that thing where I talk shop at dinner again, aren't I? But yeah, forty-eight hundred annually to be exact, which is basically, uh, enough to cover my entire equipment lease for the year, so it's kind of a big deal for a small practice.
39. Perfect timing! Oh, and hey, just so you know, if you ever need an adjustment, first visit is only sixty-five for friends. That includes the full consultation and, um, x-rays if needed, which normally runs about one-seventy-five at most places.
40. Ah man, how long has it been bothering you? Because if it's been more than, like, two weeks, you really shouldn't wait much longer. The longer you let it go, the more sessions it typically takes—usually three to four initially, then maybe once every two weeks for maintenance.
41. Ooh, yeah, definitely come see me then. Look, I have openings Tuesday at ten-thirty or Thursday at three-fifteen, and honestly, with a month of pain, we're probably looking at, erhm, six to eight visits total to get you properly sorted out, but we can spread those over like two months to make it manageable.
42. Most of them genuinely think vegetables just appear in grocery stores. I had a ten-year-old last week who didn't realize potatoes grow underground. She thought they grew on trees like apples.
43. It gets worse. When we started our school garden program, half the kids wouldn't touch soil because they thought dirt was inherently dangerous or toxic. They've been so disconnected from nature that earth itself seems alien.
44. Start small. We do taste tests first—let them try a sun-warmed tomato straight from the vine versus a grocery store one. Once they realize what they've been missing, they suddenly care about how things grow.
45. Mixed reactions honestly. Some parents love it, others complain we should focus on test scores. But here's the thing—gardening teaches science, math, patience, responsibility. It's interdisciplinary learning at its finest.
46. Container gardens, vertical walls, hydroponic towers. We converted an old janitor's closet into a growing lab with LED lights. Where there's a will, there's absolutely a way to bring nature indoors.
47. [apologetic] I know, I know, it's frustrating. We prioritized standardized testing over life skills. Two generations now have grown up thinking food production is someone else's problem, not something they need to understand.
48. [anxious] That's... that's actually a widespread belief! Twenty percent of Americans apparently think that! We've created this bizarre fairy-tale version of agriculture that's completely divorced from reality!
49. A teenager who didn't know chickens lay eggs without roosters. She thought eggs were baby chickens and was horrified she'd been eating them. The basic biology knowledge gap is staggering.
50. Exactly! That's what gives me hope. Once kids make these connections, they become passionate advocates. They go home and demand their parents compost, they start questioning food waste, they actually think about ecosystems.
51. Usually about six weeks. First they're grossed out by worms, then they're fascinated, then they're explaining vermiculture to their parents at dinner. The transformation is beautiful once they reconnect with the natural world.
52. Oh okay, yeah, meditation can feel overwhelming at first. The simplest way is literally just sitting for, like, two minutes and focusing on your breathing—that's it, nothing fancy.
53. [curious] Mmm, why does that surprise you? Most people think they need to meditate for thirty minutes right away, but honestly, consistency matters way more than duration.
54. [fast] No no no, that's exactly how people burn out! Start tiny, like ridiculously tiny, and then maybe add a minute each week if it feels good.
55. Apps can help, sure, but they're not necessary. I mean, people meditated for thousands of years without smartphones, right? Sometimes simple silence is actually better.
56. Erhm, I try to. Some weeks are better than others, you know? The key is not beating yourself up when you miss days.
57. [singing] The wandering mind, the wandering mind! But here's the thing—that's totally normal. Your brain will think thoughts, that's literally its job.
58. You just, um, gently notice it and come back to breathing. No judgment, no frustration—think of it like training a puppy, basically.
59. Hmm, some people feel calmer after one session, but real changes usually take, I'd say, two or three weeks of daily practice.
60. [speeding up] Well ideally yes but look if you miss a day it's not the end of the world just get back to it when you can.
61. It's simple but not easy, if that makes sense. The actual practice is super basic, but, uh, showing up consistently—that's where people struggle.
62. Mmm, yeah that's... that's tough when something you loved just kind of slips away like that. The muscle memory, it's weird how it fades, you know? But honestly, the basic step usually comes back pretty quickly once you, erhm, start moving again.
63. [laugh loudly] Oh man, I actually remember Sarah! She had that, um, that incredible triple step, right? Though honestly, dancing with the same partner for so long and then... well, losing that connection makes everything feel different, doesn't it?
64. Aah, I get that. When you associate certain songs with specific people or, like, particular moments, they become sort of... haunted? But maybe that's just your brain protecting you right now, kind of dampening things until you're ready to, I dunno, feel it all again.
65. Woof, that's... no, I mean, only you can answer that really. But here's the thing—you came here tonight, didn't you? That tells me something in you still, errm, wants this, even if it's buried under all the other stuff right now.
66. [frustrated] Right, so you're here to fill time, not to dance—I mean, that's fine, whatever gets you through the door! But look, swing dancing isn't just about having a partner, it's about the community, the music, the, uh, the joy of movement itself, arguably.
67. Sheesh, okay, that's... that's heavy. But memories aren't necessarily bad, right? Sometimes they hurt at first but then they, kind of, transform into something else, something you can carry without it weighing you down so much.
68. You're right, I probably don't—not exactly, anyway. But I've seen dozens of people come back to dancing after loss, divorce, illness, whatever, and they all say it feels wrong at first, like wearing someone else's shoes or something.
69. Hang on, wait, just... give it one song, alright? Not even a full dance, just stand here and, erhm, listen to the music with me—no pressure to move or remember steps or anything like that.
70. [whispering loudly] Oh gosh, okay, here comes "Sing Sing Sing"—this one always gets people, I swear. Just close your eyes and let it, um, wash over you, and if your feet start tapping, well, that's technically not dancing, so you're safe.
71. [upset] No, no, don't apologize for grieving, that's... Man, loss changes everything, obviously, and dancing might never feel exactly the same. But maybe, I mean maybe, it could eventually feel different but still, ehhh, still good in its own way, you know?
72. Oh, it really is, but, um, in the best possible way, you know? I mean, every day I get to stand up for people who've been hurt, give them a voice when they're feeling powerless, and that's just... that's incredibly fulfilling.
73. Mmm, absolutely, the pressure is real. But here's what keeps me going—I think about the families sitting behind me in court, trusting me to, uh, help them find some kind of justice or closure, and suddenly that pressure becomes fuel, you know?
74. Well, thank you! I've learned that, honestly, the hardest cases often teach me the most about resilience and compassion. Like, seeing survivors testify with such courage? Man, it reminds me why this work matters so deeply.
75. Yeah, so, I've developed this practice where I, um, I actually write letters to the victims I couldn't help—never send them, obviously, but it's my way of processing and promising to do better next time, which really helps me stay centered.
76. [sleepily] Mmm, I guess I am... sorry, long day in court, but yeah, justice is kind of my whole thing. When you see how much healing can come from accountability, from someone finally being believed and validated, it's, uh, it becomes more than just a job.
77. Oh gosh, definitely the moments when victims become survivors, when they walk out of court standing a little taller because someone fought for them, believed them, and, well, that transformation? That's what gets me up every morning, even on the really tough days.
78. [angry] No, that's such a misconception! Being firm isn't the same as being cruel—I can demand accountability while still treating everyone, even defendants, with basic human dignity, and honestly, that approach actually makes me more effective in court.
79. Right? Like, the best prosecutors I know lead with empathy first, because, um, understanding human complexity makes you better at presenting truth. We're not just trying to win—we're trying to illuminate what really happened and why it matters.
80. Ahh, that means so much to hear, truly. Some days are harder than others, but when someone tells me years later that our case helped them reclaim their life? Man, that's... that's everything.
81. Hmm, never, not even once. Sure, it's emotionally demanding and sometimes heartbreaking, but I get to wake up knowing that my work directly helps heal communities, protect vulnerable people, and, well, build a more just world—how could I want anything else?
82. [high-pitched] Clay chose me—not the other way around! When I was seven, I touched wet earth after rain and understood: this material remembers everything. Every fingerprint, every intention, every... mistake becomes permanent once you fire it.
83. Beautiful? No no no—it's mathematical. The silica particles align at precisely 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit; the molecular structure transforms irreversibly. Poetry happens in the kiln where science and art collide at temperatures that would melt aluminum.
84. The clay speaks in moisture content: leather-hard whispers "not yet," bone-dry shouts "NOW!" Touch it with the back of your hand—cool means water remains, warm means the minerals have settled into their pre-fire meditation.
85. Raku! Oh, raku firing is controlled chaos—you pull glowing pieces from the kiln at 1,800 degrees and plunge them into sawdust. The smoke penetrates the crackled glaze creating patterns that look like lightning frozen in time.
86. Danger is relative; respect is absolute. Fire doesn't negotiate—you wear kevlar gloves, you move with purpose, you breathe carefully. The kiln gods demand reverence or they crack your work into a thousand useless shards.
87. Three years ago: forty-seven bowls, a commission for a restaurant. I rushed the drying phase by twelve hours—every single one split down the middle like broken hearts when the water expanded too quickly.
88. Devastating taught me patience! Now I count days like a meditation: day one to three for slow drying, day four for trimming, days five through seven for bone-dry waiting. Time is the invisible ingredient nobody discusses.
89. [clearing throat] Because... because Western culture worships speed over mastery. Japanese potters apprentice for ten years before they're allowed to center clay independently—here, people expect perfection after a six-week course at the community center.
90. Excessive? Your hands need ten thousand repetitions to understand clay's personality: how porcelain differs from stoneware, how earthenware forgives but won't survive high-fire. Muscle memory isn't built in workshops—it's earned through decades of spiral wedging.
91. Fall in love with failure first. Every collapsed wall teaches balance; every S-crack reveals timing; every glaze disaster shows chemistry's truth. The wheel spins at sixty RPMs but mastery arrives at the speed of geology—slow, patient, inevitable.
92. Oh wow, yeah, they actually do! It's, um, pretty wild when you think about it—two pump blood to their gills and one pumps it to the rest of their body, which is honestly such an elegant solution for their lifestyle.
93. So, uh, it's basically because they have this copper-based blood called hemocyanin instead of iron like us, and it's not as efficient at carrying oxygen, so they need that extra pumping power, especially when they're jetting around underwater.
94. Mmm, that's... that's actually a beautiful question. I mean, they probably do—they have neurons in their arms that can make independent decisions, like, each arm kind of has its own mini-brain, which must create this distributed consciousness we can't even imagine.
95. You know, the research on that is, err, still pretty murky—some studies suggest they might, but it's hard to test because they don't really care about their appearance the way, like, dolphins or elephants do when they see their reflection.
96. Oh gosh, I think about that all the time! Like, they solve puzzles, use tools, escape from tanks—there's this octopus at an aquarium who learned to turn off the lights by shooting water at the bulbs because, apparently, he preferred the dark.
97. Ah, well, that's the tragic part—most only live like one to two years, maybe five for the giant Pacific octopus, which seems so unfair for something that brilliant, you know?
98. [long pause] It's... honestly, it's kind of heartbreaking. They're basically programmed to die after mating—the males wander off and die, and females literally starve themselves while guarding their eggs, which is, I mean, such a profound sacrifice.
99. [shy] Oh, um, actually there's this incredible footage of octopuses changing colors while they sleep, and researchers think they might be, uh, dreaming about hunting or hiding, which is just... can you imagine dreaming in colors across your whole body?
100. [very sincerely] So here's the weird thing—they're actually colorblind, technically, they only have one type of photoreceptor, but somehow they can match any color perfectly, and we still don't fully understand how they do it, which kind of keeps me up at night sometimes.
101. Hmm, for a day? Absolutely. I'd love to experience that distributed consciousness, to taste with my skin, to squeeze through impossibly tiny spaces—but honestly, knowing it would only be for such a brief lifetime would probably break my heart.
102. [passionately] Oh man, okay, responsible disclosure is absolutely critical here—you're talking about something that could harm people if mishandled, right? The key is, uh, documenting everything while following proper channels, because honestly, doing this right protects both you and whoever might be affected.
103. Right, so security vulnerabilities have, like, really specific protocols—basically you want to notify the company privately first, give them reasonable time to patch it, usually around 90 days is standard, before even thinking about going public with anything.
104. Mmm, that's where it gets tricky, and I mean, I've seen this happen—if they're unresponsive or dismissive, you might need to escalate to, um, regulatory bodies or even consider working with journalists who specialize in this stuff, but that's really a last resort.
105. [sarcastic] Oh sure, because companies just love whistleblowers, right? But seriously, document everything—emails, dates, who you talked to—and, erm, maybe consult with a lawyer who knows this space, because retaliation is unfortunately super common even when you're doing the right thing.
106. I know, I know, it's a lot, but listen—you're already thinking about this the right way, which is, honestly, more than most people would do, and that intention to help rather than exploit or ignore? That matters legally and ethically.
107. Absolutely! There's the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and, uh, various bug bounty programs if it's that kind of vulnerability, plus industry-specific groups that can guide you through the process—you don't have to navigate this alone, which is, like, really important to remember.
108. Oof, well, depending on what you found, you could potentially have legal liability for not reporting it, especially if, um, if people get hurt and it comes out that you knew—plus, honestly, the psychological weight of knowing and not acting can be brutal.
109. [whispering loudly] God yes, timing is everything—report too early without evidence and you look paranoid, wait too long and you might be complicit, but generally speaking, er, once you're certain there's a real issue, moving quickly but carefully is your best bet.
110. You don't need absolute proof, just, you know, reasonable belief that something's wrong based on what you've observed—the investigation part isn't really your job, that's for, uh, the people you report it to, but you should have enough to show it's not just speculation.
111. Yeah, exactly, start there—dates, times, what you saw, screenshots if possible, and, hmm, maybe create a secure backup somewhere safe, because sometimes evidence has a funny way of disappearing once companies know you're onto something, if you know what I mean.
112. Word travels fast in this neighborhood. They needed help more than I needed that money. Their daughter's medical bills were crushing them, and I had savings just sitting there doing nothing.
113. It was my house down payment fund. Took me six years to save it, but houses will always be there. Their daughter might not have been if they couldn't afford the treatment.
114. They're not strangers, they're neighbors. And dreams can wait—emergencies can't. Besides, what good is a dream home if you know the family three doors down lost everything trying to save their child?
115. Most people don't realize how little separates them from needing that same help. One diagnosis, one accident, and suddenly you're drowning. I've been there before—someone pulled me out when I was seventeen.
116. House fire took everything we owned. Some woman we'd never met paid for our hotel, bought us clothes, even covered my college application fees. Never got her name—she just vanished after setting us up.
117. Absolutely. That woman changed my entire trajectory. Without her, I don't get into college, don't get my engineering degree, don't have savings to give away in the first place.
118. You're not prying, you're curious about human behavior. That's healthy. We should all question why we do what we do, why we help or don't help.
119. Interesting choice. You know Grace isn't just about religion, right? It's about unearned kindness, giving without expecting return. That's the whole point—sacrifice isn't sacrifice if you're keeping score.
120. [exhausted] I know, they keep trying. Luis came by yesterday with an envelope, Maria brings food every evening. They don't understand that letting me help was their gift to me.
121. Because it reminded me why I work so hard in the first place. Not for things, not for security, but for the ability to matter when it counts. They gave me the chance to be that mysterious woman from my past.
122. Oh man, it's, uh, it's way more than that honestly. I'm reading the crowd, mixing tracks live, creating this whole energy that doesn't exist without me there, you know? It's basically conducting an emotional orchestra every night.
123. Mmm, okay, so that's like saying a chef isn't really cooking because they didn't grow the vegetables themselves. I'm taking existing ingredients and, um, transforming them into something completely new, creating experiences that literally move people.
124. Ooh, yeah, that's... that's heavy. Look, I mean, I get why you're worried, but some of us just aren't wired for the traditional path, you know? The music industry is brutal but when it works, it really works.
125. Ha, right, I wish it was that simple. I'm managing like four different software programs simultaneously, beat-matching by ear, reading body language of hundreds of people, and essentially performing live for five hours straight without breaks.
126. No no, it's cool, I get it. My parents think I'm basically unemployed too. They keep asking when I'm getting a "real job" even though I'm pulling in more than my brother the accountant.
127. [joking] Well, during wedding season I'm basically printing money. Turns out people will pay stupid amounts for someone who can get Grandma doing the Electric Slide, you know?
128. Yeah, um, those are... those are real concerns. I've got my own health insurance now and I'm putting money away, but it took years to get stable. It's definitely not for everyone, that's for sure.
129. Ehhh, technically yes, but that's like saying you can learn surgery on YouTube. The technical stuff, sure, but reading a room? Recovering from equipment failures? Building a reputation? That takes years of, uh, pretty embarrassing failures honestly.
130. [shy] Actually, um, that's what I did. Finished my degree while DJing nights and weekends. Gave me something to fall back on when COVID basically erased my entire industry for a year.
131. Electrical engineering, if you can believe it. Turns out understanding signal flow and, uh, frequency modulation actually helps a lot with mixing. But honestly? I've never once used my degree for anything except impressing skeptical uncles at family dinners.
132. [empathetically] Oh wow, yeah, I know! God, isn't it just... it's incredible, right? I've been, um, I've been hunting for this exact pressing for literally three years now, and here it is, just sitting in the bins like it's nothing special.
133. [formal] Well, I suppose I should mention that I have rather acute hearing—perfect pitch, actually. But honestly, I was mostly watching because, uh, your Velvet Underground shirt is spectacular and you were muttering about Nico's collaborations, which, I mean, that's basically my favorite conversation topic ever.
134. Oh man, yeah, I hear everything in here—it's kind of overwhelming sometimes, you know? Like, the fluorescents are humming in B-flat, which is actually really annoying, and the cash register, jeez, it keeps hitting this sharp F that just... ugh. But hearing someone else who actually knows about German experimental music? That's, that's rare.
135. Was! Oh God, was I ever. I did, um, session work for years—played on some pretty wild stuff actually. But then I kind of, well, I told Phil Spector his wall of sound was basically just organized noise, which... yeah, that didn't go over great. So now I'm here, digging through bins, finding treasures nobody else even recognizes.
136. [laugh hysterically] Oh my God, you're literally holding my album! Right there, under your arm—that blue one! I played Hammond organ on track seven, and I haven't seen a copy in, what, fifteen years? This is absolutely insane!
137. Ha! Story of my life right there, honestly. We only pressed maybe, mmm, 500 copies before everything went sideways—the label folded, the producer, uh, he overdosed like two weeks after we wrapped, and suddenly it was like the whole project was cursed or something. Nobody wanted anything to do with it.
138. [very excited] To collectors? Probably nothing, but to me? Oh man, everything! That album was supposed to be my big break—we recorded it in this supposedly haunted church in Louisiana where, get this, Robert Johnson allegedly made his crossroads deal!
139. Okay, so this is where it gets really weird—the tape machines kept recording after we unplugged them. Like, we got three full minutes of music that nobody played, and it still, it still gives me goosebumps thinking about it. It's on track eleven if you've got really good headphones.
140. No, no, I swear! I've actually got the master tapes in my apartment—been trying to figure out that phantom track for, jeez, must be a decade now. Sometimes I think, okay, maybe it's just electromagnetic interference or something, but the melody follows these, these rules that shouldn't even exist in Western music theory.
141. Really? Oh wow, you'd be the first person who actually wanted to hear it—everyone else thought I'd completely lost it. But if you're serious, I mean really serious, bring that album and, um, whatever you know about impossible music. This could be... this could be amazing.
142. [angry] Oh don't even get me started—it was, uh, complete chaos at first! The kids literally refused to split up from their usual groups, and I mean, I had to practically drag them to their expert groups, which was honestly exhausting.
143. Well, yeah, actually, after about fifteen minutes something just, er, clicked. They started teaching each other these complex concepts about ecosystems, and suddenly they were, like, really invested in making sure their teammates understood everything perfectly.
144. Exactly! See, when they realize they're responsible for someone else's learning, it's, hmm, totally different from just memorizing for themselves. I watched this one kid who never talks basically become this passionate teacher explaining, you know, photosynthesis to his group.
145. Right, so I had five topics—producers, consumers, decomposers, energy flow, and, uh, nutrient cycles. Each expert group got really deep into their topic with these hands-on materials I prepared, and then, well, they had to go back and teach their home groups everything.
146. You should! But, okay, fair warning—the prep work is, er, pretty intense. You need to create materials that are challenging enough for the expert phase but also, I mean, simple enough that kids can actually teach it to each other effectively.
147. Ooh, that's where it gets interesting—I do this combination thing where, um, everyone takes an individual quiz but their grade is averaged with their home group's scores. So basically they're motivated to make sure everyone learns, not just, you know, the smart kids carrying everyone else.
148. Mmm, sometimes, yeah, but I also build in these peer evaluation components where they rate each other's contributions. Plus I'm, like, constantly circulating and taking notes on who's really engaging versus who's just, uhh, coasting along hoping others will do the work.
149. Oh absolutely, that's my go-to for quick formative assessment actually. I'll pose a question, give them thirty seconds to think alone, then, er, two minutes to discuss with a partner, and honestly the quality of responses after that process is so much richer than just calling on raised hands.
150. [slowly] Yeah, timing is... well, it's tricky because different pairs work at really different speeds. What I've started doing is using this, hmm, flexible approach where I watch for when about seventy percent are engaged, then give a thirty-second warning before sharing out.
151. Gosh, yes—Padlet for collaborative brainstorming, Google Docs for group writing projects, and there's this, uh, amazing app called Flipgrid where students record video responses to each other. Technology actually makes the cooperation piece way more manageable, especially when you're, like, trying to document everyone's contributions for assessment purposes.
152. [formal] I've been working with ceramics for thirty-two years, and I assure you it's more chemistry than spirituality. Every glaze reaction follows predictable patterns based on oxide combinations and firing temperatures.
153. Clay contains aluminum silicate, iron oxide, and dozens of trace minerals that behave differently under heat stress. When you fire at cone 10, you're creating a vitrification process that transforms the molecular structure permanently.
154. The ceramic tiles on the Space Shuttle could withstand re-entry temperatures of 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Your coffee mug and spacecraft heat shields share the same fundamental material science—just different applications of silica-based engineering.
155. True, but we use the same principles. Temperature curves, thermal shock resistance, coefficient of expansion—these calculations determine whether your piece survives or explodes in the kiln.
156. I've seen a trapped air bubble turn a vase into ceramic shrapnel at 2,000 degrees. The rapid expansion of heated gases doesn't care whether you call it art or engineering—physics wins every time.
157. More people get injured in home kitchens than pottery studios. The difference is respect for the process—you learn quickly that clay has rules, and breaking them costs you weeks of work.
158. [cheerful] Efficiency isn't always the goal! Some of my wood-fired pieces take seventy-two hours of continuous stoking to achieve the ash glazes I want. The ancient techniques create surfaces no modern method can replicate.
159. Actually, I use a computer-controlled kiln for most firings now. It maintains temperature curves within half a degree, preventing thermal shock better than any manual system ever could.
160. Because certain effects only happen through carbon trapping in reduction atmospheres or fly ash deposition in wood kilns. Technology enhances tradition—it doesn't replace the chemistry that creates truly unique surfaces.
161. Inconsistent is accurate, yes. But crystalline glazes that form differently every time, creating patterns like frozen waterfalls? That unpredictability is exactly what collectors pay thousands for—controlled chaos at 2,200 degrees.
162. [stuttering] Oh, V-Vicon, yeah we actually, um, we just installed their T-Series cameras last month. Eight cameras tracking at 250 fps for gait analysis, though honestly the calibration process is, er, pretty intense compared to OptiTrack.
163. [regretful] Man, I wish we'd gone with the Helen Hayes protocol from the start. We tried a custom 12-marker setup on the foot alone but the occlusion issues were, uh, basically nightmarish, especially during heel strike phases.
164. Retroreflective all the way. The 14mm spheres work best for, hmm, for foot tracking actually. Active markers generate too much heat and, I mean, when you're testing athletic performance that kind of throws off the whole biomechanical authenticity thing.
165. [extremely happy] Oh that's where Cortex software absolutely shines! The gap-filling algorithms use cubic spline interpolation and, erm, we can reconstruct up to 10 frames of missing data without noticeable drift in the trajectory calculations!
166. Minimum 500 fps for heel strike, but we're, uhh, we're pushing for 1000. The ground reaction forces peak within 20 milliseconds, so standard 120 fps mocap is essentially useless for understanding cushioning dynamics.
167. Yeah, two AMTI plates running at 2000 Hz. The synchronization happens through, er, through BNC cables into the Vicon Lock unit, gives us sub-millisecond accuracy between kinematic and kinetic data streams.
168. Mmm, sure. We use Xsens MTw Awinda sensors, seventeen of them actually, but the drift is, oof, it's rough after about three minutes. Indoor optical tracking is still way more reliable for precision work.
169. Usually fifteen to twenty, different foot types, pronation patterns, all that. The, um, the data processing alone takes about four hours per subject when you factor in cleaning, labeling, and inverse kinematics calculations.
170. C3D definitely. It's the biomechanics standard and, I mean, Visual3D reads it natively. FBX is more for, uhh, for animation studios really, not serious gait analysis or footwear development work.
171. Tested it last year actually. The AI pose estimation is impressive but, hmm, for shoe design we really need that sub-millimeter precision on foot segments, and markerless just isn't there yet, especially for metatarsal tracking.
172. Sixteen actually, but, uh, who's counting? The thing is, it stopped being about soccer probably around year three. Now I'm basically teaching kids how to lead themselves and each other through, you know, controlled chaos every Tuesday and Thursday.
173. Well, I mean, yesterday's practice—perfect example. Had two captains arguing about defensive formation, right? Instead of jumping in, I let them work it out. Twenty minutes of heated discussion, and they actually came up with something better than what I had planned.
174. Oh absolutely, and we do drills, we run plays, all that. But, hmm, here's what parents don't see—when their kid learns to communicate under pressure on the field, that's them learning to present in a boardroom someday. Leadership isn't about the ball.
175. Oof, that's... that's actually the wrong question. Every kid has it, they just show it differently. Some lead by example, barely say a word. Others are vocal, organizing everyone. I had this one quiet kid who became captain just because everyone naturally looked to him during tough moments.
176. Yeah, sort of. We rotate captaincy every month, which, er, sounds simple but it's transformative. Kids who never saw themselves as leaders suddenly have to make decisions. The confidence shift is, gosh, it's incredible to watch happen in real time.
177. Mmm, those are my favorites actually. The resistant ones usually care the most about not letting people down. Once they realize leadership is really about serving the team, not bossing people around, something just, like, clicks for them.
178. Oh man, last season. This girl, Sophie, anxiety disorder, could barely speak up in huddles. By playoffs she was calling plays, motivating the team during our worst game. Her mom was basically sobbing on the sidelines watching it happen.
179. I tell them straight up—your kid can win every trophy and still fail at life, or lose every game and become, you know, an incredible human. Usually takes about three weeks before they stop keeping score and start noticing how their kid treats teammates.
180. Lost a whole team once. Got too focused on winning a tournament, pushed them too hard, forgot everything I just told you about. Five kids quit. That's when I realized I was, um, coaching for my ego, not for them.
181. [gasp] The thing is, those kids taught me more about leadership than any coaching clinic ever could. Now every practice starts with asking them what they need from me, not telling them what I need from them.
182. That's concerning. We should implement a VPN immediately for all remote access. I recommend OpenVPN or WireGuard protocols—they'll encrypt traffic at 256-bit AES minimum and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on volunteer data.
183. For nonprofits, I'd suggest NordVPN's nonprofit program or ProtonVPN. Both offer AES-256-GCM encryption, kill switches, and no-logs policies. ProtonVPN actually gives free premium accounts to qualifying organizations through their Visionary program.
184. [whispering] WireGuard only adds about 5-10% latency compared to OpenVPN's 15-20%. The kernel-level implementation uses ChaCha20 for encryption and Poly1305 for authentication. It's significantly faster for volunteer database access.
185. [very loudly] Every device needs the VPN client! Android and iOS both support IKEv2/IPSec natively. We configure split tunneling to route only organizational traffic through the VPN, preserving bandwidth for personal use.
186. It's a calculated trade-off. Full tunnel forces all traffic through our servers, increasing load by 300%. Split tunneling with proper ACLs isolates organizational resources while maintaining 50-60 Mbps throughput for volunteers.
187. Multi-hop configurations with automatic failover. Primary server in Virginia, secondary in Oregon. If latency exceeds 150ms or packet loss hits 2%, the client switches endpoints automatically using OSPF routing metrics.
188. [shouting] SASE is overkill for our scale! We're talking Zscaler or Prisma Access—enterprise solutions costing $50,000 annually minimum. A properly configured VPN with MFA handles our 200 volunteers perfectly at 5% of that cost.
189. Configure DNS over HTTPS using Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 or Quad9. The VPN client must enforce these resolvers. We'll also implement DNSSEC validation to prevent cache poisoning attacks on volunteer lookup queries.
190. [stern] Weekly penetration tests using Wireshark and tcpdump. Monitor for DNS leaks, WebRTC exposures, and IPv6 bypass attempts. Any volunteer accessing PII without VPN connection gets immediately flagged in our SIEM dashboard.
191. [gasp softly] Absolutely not! Server selection must be automatic based on latency algorithms. Allowing manual selection creates inconsistent security postures and complicates our audit trails. The system chooses optimal endpoints, period.
192. Actually no, this is my third year running. Though last year I got bumped to the 2 AM slot right after someone who brought puppets—tough crowd after midnight puppets, let me tell you.
193. [excited] Oh absolutely, comedy puppets are having this weird renaissance right now! There's this guy who does existential crisis Kermit, another one with a nihilistic sock that discusses Kafka—it's simultaneously terrible and brilliant.
194. Not just puppets—last night there was a mime doing stand-up. Yes, silent stand-up comedy. The audience just sat there confused for twenty minutes while he gestured aggressively at nothing.
195. It doesn't. That's the beautiful disaster of it. He got three courtesy laughs and someone threw a dinner roll at him. The roll got bigger laughs than his entire set.
196. I wish I was, but comedy festivals attract the strangest acts. There's someone doing mathematical humor tonight—their opener is about prime numbers dating. "Why was six afraid of seven? Because seven eight nine, but also seven is prime and therefore inherently untrustworthy."
197. The worst part is he's killing it with the tech crowd. They're eating up his binary jokes and probability puns while the rest of us just stare blankly wondering if we should laugh.
198. [warm] Hey no, don't say that—you're actually funny, which already puts you ahead of puppet guy and math comedian. Plus you use actual words, which is surprisingly becoming a competitive advantage around here.
199. Look at it this way—the weirder everyone else gets, the more refreshing regular observational comedy becomes. You talking about airline food might actually feel revolutionary after someone performs interpretive dance comedy.
200. [very meekly] I may have signed up for that workshop by accident... thought it said "interactive" not "interpretive" and now I'm committed to expressing my childhood trauma through jazz hands tomorrow at noon.
201. The instructor says comedy is pain plus movement plus time. I told her that's not the expression but she just started doing this aggressive shimmy at me so I backed down immediately.
202. That's actually fascinating though—moths are completely underrated pollinators, right? Most people obsess over butterflies but moths do the heavy lifting at night when nobody's watching.
203. Well, I mean, I get obsessive about things too. Last year I spent four months documenting every single crack in the sidewalks between my apartment and the subway station. Sometimes you just need to follow what pulls you.
204. No way, like actually squeak? That's incredible—I bet it's some kind of defense mechanism against predators. Does it sound threatening or more like a tiny mouse?
205. Your ex sounds like someone who's never felt genuine curiosity about anything. Look, you're building a body of knowledge that literally no one else is creating—that's the opposite of pointless, that's pioneering.
206. Too many for what exactly? If you're documenting migration patterns, 14,000 might not even be enough. You probably need multiple shots per specimen, different angles, various locations—honestly, I'm impressed you've been so thorough.
207. That happens when you're really deep into something—your brain keeps processing even when you're unconscious. I used to dream in spreadsheet cells when I was analyzing urban decay patterns. The patterns in your dreams might actually be your mind making connections you haven't consciously recognized yet.
208. [shaky voice] Oh, I... well, understanding comes from experience, I guess. When you've spent enough time defending your own weird interests, you recognize a kindred spirit pretty quickly.
209. Absolutely, yes. And don't just show me one—I want to see the progression, how you've refined your technique over six years. I bet your early photos versus now tell their own story.
210. Most people are cowards who can't appreciate dedication. Show me fifty if you want—I once made someone sit through my entire collection of rust pattern photographs from abandoned buildings.
211. [friendly] Hey, strange is just another word for specific, right? We should compare notes sometime—I bet there's overlap between moth migration routes and urban decay sites that neither of us has noticed yet.
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS (continued) ---
212. Then why are we here, Marcus? Why are we sitting in this stupid coffee shop talking about square footage and closing costs instead of, I don't know, actually trying to fix this?
213. Your work with the union was the only thing that ever mattered! [crying while speaking] Every conversation somehow became about workers' rights or corporate greed or some new organizing campaign, and I just wanted to talk about us, about our plans, about something that wasn't always a fight against the system.
214. But you chose, Marcus. Every single day, you chose the fight over me, and now here we are, dividing up the only thing we managed to build together.
215. [whispering] So was I. [pause] Look, let's just list it at three-fifty like the realtor suggested and split everything down the middle, okay? I can't keep doing this, having these conversations that go nowhere.
216. [standing up] Pretty much, yeah. [very quietly] Take care of yourself, Marcus, and keep fighting your fights, I know they matter to you more than anything else ever will. [trailing off] They always have...
217. Hello, Lily. [clearing throat] The receptionist said my nurse would be someone named L. Chen, but I never imagined it would actually be you working here.
218. [warmly] It's the right thing.
219. [quietly] Nothing recent, no.
220. [curious] Does it hurt more than regular blood donation? I've been donating whole blood for years but this is my first time doing platelets.
221. [smiling speaking] Speaking of rhythmic processes, I spend my days now teaching people about wine fermentation and aging, which has its own meditative quality.
222. You still talk to Mom? [surprised] She told me you hadn't spoken to anyone in the family for three years after the fight about Dad's treatment. [pause]
223. [empathetically] You were nineteen, Lily, and watching your father die of leukemia while studying to become a nurse must have been excruciating.
224. [softly] Is that why you're emotional about my donation today? [gently] Because the recipient is a child with leukemia, and it's bringing everything back?
225. [warmly] Then I'll come back every two weeks for as long as she needs platelets. [very sincerely] Maybe we could grab coffee after one of the sessions, catch up properly?
226. Only if you promise to explain how this amazing machine works, because watching my blood go out and come back while it keeps the platelets is absolutely fascinating. [chuckles]
227. [frustrated] We've addressed every single environmental concern in that two-hundred-page impact assessment. What more could you possibly need from us at this point?
228. [passionately] Those trials are for pediatric neurological disorders that affect one in ten thousand children. We're literally trying to save kids' lives here, not endanger them. [sighs] This is exhausting.
229. [bitter] Scared of what exactly? That we might accidentally cure something? [pause] Do you know how many families are desperately waiting for these trials to expand?
230. [shocked] Wait, your wife is Sarah Chen? [softly] Oh my god, I've reviewed her case file dozens of times. She's exactly the type of patient we could help if we could just scale up.
231. [urgently] Listen, the expansion isn't just about more space, it's about manufacturing capacity for the treatment compounds. Without it, we're stuck treating twelve patients a year instead of twelve hundred.
232. [empathetically] You must think I'm trying to manipulate you now, but I swear I had no idea about the connection. Your last name is different from hers, and I never put it together.
233. [quickly] What if we modified the proposal? Reduced the footprint by thirty percent, added a community liaison program, maybe even offered free screenings for local families? Would that change anything?
234. [hopeful] We can have a revised proposal to you by tonight. [pause] Can I ask how Sarah's doing? Her last update showed some concerning progression markers.
235. [warmly] There's no conflict in wanting to save lives, including your wife's. Let me get that revision to you, and we'll make this work somehow.
236. [determined] You'll have it by six. And listen, regardless of what happens with the zoning, I'm going to personally review Sarah's case again. Sometimes we can fast-track compassionate use exemptions.
237. [anxiously] You said this was just a training exercise when you called, but you're bleeding through your jacket and your hands are shaking. [voice breaking] What happened at the facility, and why are they calling you a traitor on every encrypted channel?
238. [confused] That doesn't make sense, Director Morrison signed off on all the lab protocols himself, and he's been with the agency for thirty years. [hesitantly] Are you saying he's part of whatever this conspiracy is?
239. [whispering] No.
240. [shaky voice] You're asking me to destroy my entire career, to betray everyone I've worked with for the past five years. [frustrated] Even if what you're saying is true, they'll come after me the moment I access those files.
241. [very quietly] How long have you known about this? [accusingly] How many operations did we run together while you were sitting on information about our own agency torturing people?
242. [desperately] There has to be another way, someone higher up we can report to, maybe the oversight committee or even the press directly. [speaking fast] We could leak it anonymously, keep both our names out of it completely.
243. [resigned] You've already decided you're not coming back from this, haven't you? [voice breaking] This meeting isn't about passing on information, it's you saying goodbye while pretending everything might work out fine.
244. [crying while speaking] You paranoid bastard, you've been planning an exit strategy this entire time. [laughs] All those crazy survival scenarios you put me through, the dead drops, the emergency protocols, you were preparing me to lose you.
245. [determined] Fine, I'll take the drive, I'll find a way to expose Morrison and whoever else is involved. [firmly] But you have to promise me something in return, that you'll send proof of life every six months, even if it's just a blank postcard from nowhere.
246. [quickly] Thank you for choosing me, for seeing something worth saving in a rookie who couldn't even properly clear a room. [emotionally] I won't let you down, I promise you that, and when this is over, when it's safe, I'll find you wherever you're hiding.
247. You need to turn around and walk away from me right now. [firmly] This isn't the place for whatever conversation you think we're about to have.
248. [bitter] That room was a shrine to someone who never existed. [quietly] The perfect son with perfect grades who'd marry the perfect girl from church and give them perfect grandchildren.
249. [coldly] I provide companionship to people who value sophistication and discretion. [pause] Which is more honest than the performance I had to give every Sunday at family dinner.
250. [very quietly] Stop. [exhales] You don't get to weaponize their pain against me when they never once asked what my pain felt like.
251. [hesitantly] I left a note. [slowly] I put it under the sugar bowl in the kitchen where Mom always kept her grocery money, explaining everything about who I really am.
252. [bitter] Then they found it and destroyed it, just like they would have destroyed me if I'd stayed. [firmly] This conversation is over.
253. [shaky voice] That little girl would have been horrified by what I've become. [sighs] The things I do, the life I've chosen, the men who pay for my time.
254. You should care. [passionately] I'm not coming back to that life, not returning to family dinners where everyone pretends not to see the truth. I have clients waiting, people who accept exactly who I am.
255. [warmly] The Met performs La Traviata next month on the fifteenth. [slowly] If you happen to be in the mezzanine around intermission, you might see a familiar face. [pause] Alone this time.
256. [very quietly] That boy would have loved who I became. [clearing throat] My client is returning from the bar now, so please, for both our sakes, disappear into this crowd. [long pause] Rebecca.
257. [calmly] This is about the seventeen formal complaints filed against you in the past six months, Marcus. [clears throat] I've been documenting everything—the screaming matches, the public humiliations, the, um, frankly illegal threats you've made to terminate people for taking sick days.
258. [firmly] Your senior engineer had a panic attack in the parking lot last week. [pause] She's been with us eight years, Marcus, and she's terrified to even check her email because of your, uh, let's call them 'motivational messages' at 3 AM demanding code reviews.
259. [sincerely] Greatness doesn't require destroying people, Marcus. [quietly] Look, I've worked here since day one, I believed in your vision, but somewhere along the way you, um, you started confusing fear with respect.
260. [empathetically] You weren't always like this though. [sighs] Remember when we had twelve people in that garage, and you knew everyone's kids' names? You bought Tom's daughter that violin when she got into Juilliard, you actually cared about these people as, well, as people.
261. [confidently] The board's already talking about leadership changes, Marcus. [hesitantly] They, uh, they asked me to compile a report on company culture, and I'm submitting it tomorrow with all seventeen complaints attached.
262. [warmly] No, I'm trying to save you from yourself. [pause] If you agree to executive coaching, anger management, and a formal apology to the staff, I can, um, I can frame this as a growth opportunity rather than gross misconduct.
263. [seriously] I think it might help you remember why you started this company in the first place. [sighs] It wasn't just about the money or the power, Marcus—you wanted to build something that mattered, with people who mattered to you.
264. [gently] I don't believe that, and honestly, I don't think you do either. [pause] The Marcus who hired me ten years ago said he wanted to create a company where brilliant people could do their best work without sacrificing their humanity.
265. [passionately] Then why are you crying right now? [pause] If you really believed that, if you were really this heartless tyrant you're trying so hard to be, you wouldn't have tears in your eyes talking about who you used to be.
266. [reassuringly] Then let me help you remember. [warmly] Take the coaching, Marcus, apologize to your team, and let's try to rebuild this company into something we can both be proud of again—it's not too late to change course.
267. [warmly] The chocolate smell hit me two blocks away and I knew you'd kept the place. [pause] Same copper pots in the window, same handwritten menu board.
268. [quietly] I came back because I needed to see home one more time, needed to taste your salted caramels and pretend we're still twenty-five with our whole lives ahead.
269. [bitter] Six months, maybe eight.
270. [calmly] The doctors found it everywhere when I got back from Aleppo last month. [exhales] Lungs, liver, bones. Twenty years of war zones and it's my own cells that declared war.
271. [gently] I know, but I needed to come home, needed to sit in this shop and watch you work like we used to dream about when we were kids. Remember?
272. [smiling speaking] You kept it? [laughs softly] Even after I left without saying goodbye, just that stupid note about needing to see the world?
273. [melancholic] Did I change anything? [sighs] Thousands of stories filed from dozens of countries, and the wars just kept coming, the suffering never stopped.
274. [very quietly] I'm scared, Sam.
275. [tearfully] I was hoping you'd say that but didn't want to ask, didn't want to burden you after disappearing for so long. [pause] Do you really mean it?
276. [relieved] Thank you for not hating me for leaving, for understanding why I had to go even though it meant leaving everything we'd planned behind. [crying while speaking] Thank you.
277. [defensive] Don't.
278. [bitter] Does it matter? Look, I'll leave, alright? Just, um, give me a minute to grab my stuff and you can pretend you never saw me.
279. Left after three weeks. The whole thing was, I don't know, pointless. [quietly] They wanted me to talk about feelings and childhood trauma and all that crap when really I just needed to get clean.
280. [sarcastically] Yeah well, not everyone can afford thousand-dollar suits and, uh, whatever that watch costs. [laughs bitterly] Some of us actually have to live in the real world, not in some glass tower managing other people's retirements.
281. [shouting] For what? Go ahead, say it! For drugs, for being weak, for being the family disappointment? [shaky voice] You think I don't know what everyone thinks of me?
282. [exhausted] Your help always comes with strings, Michael. It's never just help, it's, uh, lectures and conditions and making me feel like even more of a failure than I already do.
283. Yesterday morning, I think. Maybe the day before. Time gets, um, weird when you're not really sleeping, just kind of existing between being high and being sick.
284. [pause] Not since Thursday. Ran out of money, ran out of, uh, options. [trembling] That's why I came here, actually. Remembered you mentioning the garage had security cameras turned off at night for some insurance thing.
285. Maybe. I don't know. [very quietly] I'm tired, Michael. Not just, like, physically tired but tired of running, tired of lying, tired of waking up wondering if today's the day I finally OD and honestly not caring either way.
286. [crying while speaking] I don't deserve this. After everything I've done, the money I stole from Mom, the things I said to you last Christmas. [sniffles] Why would you even want to help me?
287. [bitter] You're seriously going to shut down the only independent weather station monitoring this coastline while a Category 5 hurricane barrels toward us? [exhales] The bank couldn't wait three more days until after the storm passes?
288. [desperately] That hurricane just jumped from Category 3 to 5 in six hours—that's almost unheard of rapid intensification. [shaky voice] Without my station's data, the National Weather Service is flying blind for this entire coastal region, and people won't get accurate evacuation warnings.
289. Thirty-six hours. [very quietly] Maybe less.
290. See those gaps? [trembling] That's death.
291. [hopeless] It doesn't matter anyway because the backup generators only have eighteen hours of fuel left, and my credit cards are all maxed from trying to keep this place running. [sighs] Once the power goes out, all this equipment becomes useless metal and plastic.
292. [surprised] You'd risk your job for this? [quietly] They'll know you didn't follow protocol when they review the bodycam footage—you're wearing one right now, and I'm betting it's recording everything we're saying.
293. [shaky voice] I've been running this station alone for three years since the university cut funding, selling my car, my mother's jewelry, everything to keep it operational. [exhales] Most people think I'm crazy for hanging on this long.
294. [perceptive] You keep checking your phone—your family's in the evacuation zone, aren't they? [very quietly] The storm's tracking more eastward than the mainstream models show, which means Rockport's going to get a direct hit instead of a glancing blow.
295. [exhausted] Because their data is six hours old and they're using atmospheric models that don't account for the unusual water temperatures we're seeing this year. [sighs] I've been trying to warn them but no one listens to the crazy lady in the condemned weather station anymore.
296. [crying while speaking] You don't understand what this means—I thought I was going to have to watch this storm kill people while sitting helpless in some shelter. [shaky voice] Thank you for seeing past the eviction notice to what really matters here.
297. [hesitantly] Please, Your Lordship, I meant no harm or disrespect to your family's sacred ground. [quietly] I just needed somewhere dry for the night, and the roof here still holds against the rain.
298. [anxious] I should go now, truly, before I cause any more offense to your noble house. The morning market opens soon anyway, and I might find some work there hauling crates or sweeping floors.
299. [bitter] Not 'Master' anything anymore, Your Lordship, just Edmund now, or 'old man' to most who bother addressing me at all. [sighs] Yes, it's me.
300. [monotone] Times change, patrons die, new families bring their own people. After your father passed, the new appointments went to younger men with connections at court. One by one, my students grew up and forgot their old teacher.
301. [smiling speaking] You were never slow, just different, needed stories to make the letters come alive instead of just drilling rules. [chuckles] Remember how you finally learned the alphabet by pretending each letter was a knight in your toy army?
302. [shaky voice] After the last family dismissed me five winters ago, I sold everything I owned just to eat. [trailing off] First the books, then the furniture, finally even my teaching robes, until there was nothing left to sell but my pride, and that went too eventually...
303. [defensive] I'm not looking for charity, Your Lordship, especially not from a student I once made copy sentences about maintaining dignity in all circumstances. [exhales] Some falls are too far to climb back from.
304. [very quietly] My own son hasn't spoken to me in three years, ashamed of what I've become. He walks past me in the street like I'm invisible, and perhaps it's better that way for him.
305. [whispering] I don't know if I remember how to teach anymore.
306. [slowly] Perhaps some lessons are worth teaching twice, once to the child and again to the man he becomes. [resigned] Very well, Your Lordship, I accept your offer with what little grace I have left.
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT (continued) ---
307. That fee REG-COMP-2024-Q4 was introduced this quarter following regulatory changes effective October 1st. I can email you the official notice FCC-2024-078 that details the breakdown: $45 for infrastructure compliance, $28 for security audit requirements, and $5 for administrative processing.
308. That's your comprehensive device protection plan EPP-ULTIMATE-24, which you enrolled in during your August upgrade. It covers accidental damage, theft, and mechanical failure for all three devices registered under your account: DEV-001-iPhone, DEV-002-iPad, and DEV-003-Watch.
309. Let me verify that for you. I'm checking your enrollment form dated August 22nd, reference number ENR-48291-AUG, and you're absolutely right. The iPad should have been excluded, which means you've been overcharged by $25.00 monthly since September.
310. I'm processing the adjustment immediately. Credit memo CM-7829-ADJ for $50.00 covering September and October will appear on your next statement, and I've updated your protection plan to exclude device DEV-002-iPad effective immediately.
311. Absolutely. I'm generating a revised statement summary now showing your corrected monthly total of $532.19, and you'll receive it at your registered email address within the next ten minutes along with confirmation number CNF-892745-REV for your records.
312. I apologize for the unexpected change to your account. Let me pull up your account details right away to investigate what happened with your service level.
313. You're absolutely right, and I completely understand your concern. I can see your account number is AC-88294-XL and you've indeed maintained premium status since January 2021 without interruption.
314. Certainly.
315. I've identified the issue now. There was a payment processing error on December 3rd when your card ending in 4782 was declined, which triggered an automatic downgrade after our 7-day grace period.
316. I can see you did update to a new card ending in 5923 on November 28th, but unfortunately there was a system synchronization error that prevented the update from applying to your recurring billing profile.
317. That's correct, and I sincerely apologize for this error. I'm immediately reinstating your premium service with activation code PRM-RESTORE-92847, and you'll have full functionality within the next 15 minutes.
318. Excellent question.
319. I completely understand the impact this has had on your business. I'm applying a service credit of $47.96 to your account, which represents a full month of premium service, and adding a courtesy credit of $25.00 for the inconvenience.
320. I've flagged your account with protection code FSP-1147 to prevent automatic downgrades, and I've manually verified your new payment method is properly synchronized across all our billing systems.
321. Absolutely. I'm sending a detailed summary to your email on file within the next 10 minutes, including your case reference number CS-20241210-KM847 and all applied credits and corrections.
322. I apologize for that delay. Let me pull up your account immediately. May I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account?
323. Thank you. I have your account here, number 478920-B, and I can see the previous interaction logged on October 23rd at 2:47 PM. The agent documented a refund approval for $89.50 but I don't see the processing confirmation.
324. I see exactly what happened. The refund was approved but wasn't submitted to our billing department for final processing. This absolutely should not have occurred and I sincerely apologize for this oversight.
325. Certainly. I'm processing the refund immediately while we're on the phone. I'm submitting it with priority code PX-4521 which ensures it will be completed within 24 hours rather than the standard 3-5 business days.
326. Absolutely. You'll receive an email confirmation to the address we have on file, which shows as j.morrison@techcorp.com, within the next 30 minutes. This will include your refund tracking number RFD-89234-QM.
327. I completely understand your frustration and you're right to bring this to our attention. I'm escalating this incident to our quality assurance team under case number QA-7756-19 to review the original interaction and prevent similar issues.
328. Of course. For the inconvenience you've experienced, I'm authorized to apply a $25 service credit to your account in addition to your original refund of $89.50. This brings your total credit to $114.50.
329. The full amount of $114.50 will be credited to your account by 5:00 PM Pacific Time tomorrow, October 29th. If for any reason it doesn't appear, please call our priority line at 888-924-7823 and reference case PX-4521.
330. Absolutely. I've documented everything thoroughly in your account, including the refund confirmation number RFD-89234-QM, the quality assurance case QA-7756-19, and my direct extension 4412 if you need to follow up with me personally.
331. I understand completely, and you have my assurance this is resolved. You'll receive your email confirmation shortly, and I've set a personal follow-up reminder to verify the credit posts successfully tomorrow. Thank you for your patience with us today.
332. I apologize for that frustrating experience. Let me assist you directly. May I have your account number and I'll pull up your information immediately?
333. Perfect, I have your account 487-299-5614 right here. I see you're one of our premium members since 2019. How may I assist you today?
334. Certainly. I can handle both of those updates for you right now. Let me start with the billing address change. What's the new address?
335. I've updated that to 1847 Westbrook Avenue, Suite 200, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55408. The change takes effect immediately. Now, for the authorized users, I'll need their full names and relationship to the account.
336. Excellent. I've added Sarah Mitchell and Robert Chen as authorized users. They'll each receive a welcome email within the next 30 minutes with their temporary access codes starting with AM7.
337. By default, they'll have Level 2 access, which includes viewing statements, making payments up to $5,000, and updating contact information. Would you like to modify their permissions?
338. Done. I've upgraded Sarah Mitchell to Level 1 full administrative access, effective immediately. She'll receive confirmation code SMS-4471-BK within five minutes.
339. I understand completely. I'm noting your feedback about the voice system in ticket REF-2024-1147. Our technical team reviews these weekly, and you're the third report today about recognition issues.
340. Absolutely. For premium members, you can call 888-524-7100 and press star-seven to reach a representative directly. I'll also email you this information along with your confirmation.
341. You're very welcome. I've sent the confirmation email with all updates and the direct access number. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
342. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! Let me—let me pull up your account right away. Can I get your account number? It should start with ACC and then have 8 digits after that.
343. Perfect, perfect, thank you! So I'm seeing your account here and, hmm, there's a $127.50 credit that was processed on November 3rd, but it looks like it went to... oh interesting, it went to a secondary billing profile instead of your primary.
344. Absolutely, I totally understand why that would be frustrating. So basically what happened is—er, when credits process after midnight EST, our system sometimes defaults to the first account alphabetically, which in your case is the dormant one ending in 7739.
345. I do, I do! Actually you've been with us for—wow, 14 years, that's incredible! And honestly, for someone with your history, this shouldn't happen. Let me just—I can definitely fix this right now, we'll move that full $127.50 over immediately.
346. Got it, got it!
347. No no, please don't apologize! This is—this is actually a really common issue and, uh, truthfully we should have better safeguards. So what I'm doing now is transferring credit reference CRD-9281-XK to your primary account, and it'll show within 2 to 4 hours max.
348. Hmm, let me see what I can do here... *pause* ...okay so, if I mark this as priority correction code P47, then basically it should appear within 30 minutes, and like, I'll also add a note to waive any late fees just in case.
349. Oh gosh, not at all! I mean, when money stuff goes wrong, it's stressful, right? So anyway, your confirmation number for this whole thing is TRN-88412-QM-2024, and er, would you like me to email that to you at the address we have on file?
350. So we have sarah.k.martinez at gmail, and then—oh wait, there's also one here that's smartinez at techcorp, um, which would you prefer?
351. Of course, absolutely! So that email confirmation just went out, and like I mentioned, 30 minutes max for the credit to appear. Is there, uh, is there anything else I can help you with today? Actually wait—I should also mention we're crediting an additional $15 to your account for the inconvenience, so your new balance will show $142.50 total.
352. Oh hello there! Let me just pull up your account here... I see your reference number was TKT-4821-VM from Tuesday afternoon, and it looks like everything was processed successfully. How has everything been working out for you?
353. *soft exhale* Not at all, not at all. You know, the system can be really confusing, especially with those verification steps we have to go through. I'm just so glad we got your premium membership activated properly with that 47,500 points bonus applied to your account.
354. That is... *small breath* that's really kind of you to call back and say that. You know, most people don't take the time. Your order RMA-9923-KL shipped out yesterday from our Charlotte warehouse, and you should have it by Friday.
355. Well, you did everything perfectly on your end. *thoughtful pause* Sometimes these systems just need a little nudge from our side. That $127.50 credit has already been applied to your account too, so you'll see that reflected on your next statement.
356. *soft breath* I know that feeling. Hey, while I have you here... let me make a note in your account profile ANP-3847 that you prefer email confirmations over text. That way, next time you won't have to explain your preferences again.
357. Absolutely we can do that. *pause* See, once something's in your permanent profile, any agent who pulls up your account will see it right there. Your loyalty tier is Platinum now too, so you get priority routing to senior agents like myself.
358. They really did! You've been with us since 2019, account number ends in 7734. *thoughtful pause* That's a lot of trust you've put in us. I'm just really glad we could make this right for you.
359. *exhale* I understand that completely. You know what though? I'm adding case note CNT-5543-SUCCESS to your file, highlighting how smoothly this resolution went. Sometimes we need those positive examples for training purposes.
360. *pause* We really would. Good resolutions are just as important as learning from the difficult ones. Your tracking number UPS-1Z847X9 shows delivery confirmed for Friday before 3pm, and if anything changes, you'll get that email notification now.
361. *soft breath* You're so welcome. Truly. And hey... *pause* next time you need anything, reference this case TKT-4821-VM and ask for Team Delta. We'll take good care of you. You have yourself a wonderful rest of your day, okay?
362. Oh! Okay okay, I can definitely help you with that, um, let me just pull up your account here... I think I can—actually wait, what's your order number? I'll need that to, er, to check the tracking status for you.
363. Alright so... hmm, I'm seeing ORD-4782-NX here and, uh, you're right, there's definitely something odd with the tracking. It shows it reached our facility in Memphis with code MEM-8823 but then it just—sorry, I mean it sort of stopped updating after that, which is probably why you're concerned.
364. Right right, I totally understand why that's stressful, especially with your trip tomorrow. So what I'm seeing is, um, it should've transferred to facility code LAX-9901 for California delivery, but there's maybe a scanning issue? Let me check something else real quick...
365. Oh gosh, yeah, I know that's frustrating when you've had problems before. Okay so, er, good news actually—I found it! It's at distribution center ZIP 90245, which is probably like twenty minutes from you, it just wasn't scanning properly.
366. Mmm, let me see what I can do here... the facility closes at 8 PM, but I could—wait actually, I think there's a better option. I can flag this as critical with code URGENT-VX7 and basically guarantee delivery by noon tomorrow?
367. Got it.
368. No no no, wait, I'm not giving up! Sorry, I was just thinking... okay so, um, here's what I can do—and honestly this is kind of bending the rules—but I can authorize a same-day courier with service code RUSH-88K to pick it up right now.
369. I mean, I totally get why you're skeptical, but yeah, I'm putting it through right now. The courier confirmation is CRX-1147-B, and er, you'll get a text in probably five minutes with their ETA, which should be before 10 PM tonight.
370. Absolutely certain, I've already submitted it and, uh, I'm actually seeing the courier just accepted the job—driver ID 7739—so they're heading to the facility now. Look, I know it's been a mess, but this will definitely get there tonight.
371. Hey, of course! I'm just really glad we could sort this out before your trip. Oh and, um, I added a $25 credit with code DELAY-25C to your account for all the trouble, which should show up in maybe two or three days.
372. Okay okay, let me—let me pull that up for you. Um, can I get your claim number or the email you used?
373. Right right. Er, I see several claims here. The most recent one is CL-492-MXKJ from November 12th. That's showing as. Um. Still under review. Which is—which is taking longer than usual.
374. I—I absolutely see that, Mr. Thompson. Your account status is, uh, definitely noted here as priority tier PLT-GOLD-88. The thing is. Even with priority accounts. Claims involving amounts over ten thousand need. Er. Additional verification. I wish I had better news.
375. I know. I know it's frustrating. What I can—hmm, let me check something. Your claim processor is Agent KXM-7742. They're. Uh. Actually backed up with end-of-year reviews right now.
376. You're right. This isn't—this isn't the service level you should expect. Er, what if I. Actually hang on. I could escalate this to rapid review team RRT-ALPHA. They typically process within seventy-two hours.
377. I understand. That's still. Um. Not ideal. The other option is—is requesting an exception override. Code EXC-9901-OVERRIDE. But that requires. Uh. Director approval. Which could actually take longer.
378. It's—it's not about holding funds, Mr. Thompson. The compliance team has to verify. Er. Transaction codes TRX-881 through TRX-894. Federal regulations require. Um. Full documentation for claims of this size. I really—I really wish I could bypass it.
379. Of course. Of course. Let me—um, let me connect you with my lead. Supervisor badge SUP-4419-JENKINS. They have. Er. More authority for exceptions. Just—just give me one moment to brief them on your situation.
380. No no, you're—you're absolutely right. They can see everything. Case file CLF-492-MXKJ-FULL. I just want to. Uh. Make sure they understand the urgency. The timeline. Everything. So they can actually help.
381. I will. I will. Stay on the line please. Your reference for this escalation is ESC-7729-PRIORITY. My supervisor will. Er. They'll be with you in just—just a moment. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Thompson.
382. Oh gosh, I totally understand the frustration here—our account closure option is, hmm, honestly kind of buried in the settings which I know is super annoying. Let me pull up your account real quick, um, what's the email address on file?
383. Perfect, got it! Okay so I'm looking at account ID ACC-49281-MZ here and, uh, I can definitely help you close this out. Can I ask though—and totally no pressure—but is there anything specific that made you want to leave? Sometimes there's stuff I can fix that people don't even know we can adjust.
384. Oof, yeah, I hear you on that one. Look, I'm not gonna give you the runaround here—if you want to close it, we'll close it, done deal. But just so you know, er, looking at your usage pattern USG-7749-K, you've barely touched any of the premium features you're paying for. Would dropping you to the free tier maybe work better?
385. Right? It's honestly kind of ridiculous how we don't make that clearer! The free tier launched, hmm, about three months ago—reference code TIER-FREE-2024—and it includes basically everything except the advanced analytics and priority support. You'd keep all your data, all your basic features, just no monthly charge.
386. So here's what I can do—actually let me think through this properly... okay, I can either process the full closure right now with confirmation number starting with CLS, or I can switch you to free tier effective immediately, which would be under modification code MOD-8823-FT, and then you can always close it later if you want, no hassle.
387. Oh man, that is so frustrating, I'm really sorry that happened. Let me see here... yep, I can see the previous interaction ticket TKT-3928-B where they said they'd switch you but, ugh, it never got processed properly. Tell you what—I'm gonna do this while we're on the phone together and give you a confirmation email right now so you have proof.
388. Exactly! I'm actually filling out the form as we speak—just submitted it with batch ID BTH-20241-X and... boom, check your inbox, should be there in literally five seconds. It'll show the zero dollar monthly rate and everything.
389. Starting today! And, er, here's the really good news—since we messed up before, I'm putting through a refund for the last two months under credit authorization CRD-6672-RF. Should hit your card in three to five business days.
390. Absolutely! I mean, we dropped the ball here, right? This is the least we can do. Your refund of $47.98 is locked in with transaction ID TXN-884429, and you're on free tier permanently unless you specifically choose to upgrade. No sneaky reactivations or anything like that.
391. Perfect! And hey, I'm putting a note in your account—note ID NOTE-7749-SP—that says you've been through this before, so if anything weird happens with billing again, any rep who pulls this up will immediately see the full history and fix it. Is there anything else I can help with while I've got everything pulled up?
392. Oh no worries at all, let's figure this out together! So I'm pulling up your account here—wait, sorry, need your member ID first—that's the MID number on your card, starts with MID-4 and then has like eight more digits after that.
393. Perfect, got it! Okay so between you and me? Half the calls I get are about this exact thing, and honestly—no wait, let me check something first—yep, I can see your password reset attempt from yesterday at 3:47 PM, and it looks like the system, er, didn't complete the verification step.
394. Actually no, not your fault at all! See, the verification email went to your old address ending in @hotmail—sorry, I mean, it should've gone to your gmail but the system still had your old one on file, so really that's on us.
395. Oh totally fair question! So I can see here your primary email on account ACC-7829-QM is the gmail one you updated in January, but for some reason the security settings—er, let me rephrase that—the password recovery still points to the hotmail from 2019.
396. Right right, absolutely.
397. Oh gosh no, absolutely not! Listen, I'm gonna let you in on something here—this happens literally dozens of times a day, and between you and me? It's a known glitch we haven't fixed yet, so what I'm gonna do is send you a priority reset link to SMS-7736, that's the number on file, and waive any verification holds.
398. Mm, so I can see your last four transactions, your shipping address which is, uh, lemme check—1847 Pine Street, Unit B—and basically just what I need to verify identity and help with account stuff, nothing like, you know, nothing invasive or anything.
399. Already sent! Should hit your phone in about, er, fifteen seconds—no wait, there it is, just went through at 2:47:32 PM, and once you click that link you'll get a temporary password that starts with TEMP- and then some random characters.
400. Perfect!
401. Happens to the best of us, seriously! Actually, while I have you—since this whole thing was basically our system being weird—I'm adding a courtesy credit of $15 to your account, reference number CRD-2024-8837-B, just as a sorry for the hassle, and I've updated your recovery email so this won't happen again.
402. I understand your frustration, and I apologize that your issue hasn't been resolved yet. I'm pulling up your account now using case number CS-49821-TK. May I have your name and briefly understand what happened?
403. Thank you, Ms. Morrison. I see your Enterprise License Package ELP-7700-XM was purchased on November 8th with guaranteed activation within 24 hours. Let me connect you with my supervisor, Marcus Chen, who handles priority escalations.
404. Absolutely understood. Supervisor Chen is actually available right now. Before I transfer you, I'm noting in ticket ES-112945 that this is time-critical for a client presentation. He'll have all the context when he picks up.
405. Yes, Supervisor Chen has Level 3 authorization to process manual activations immediately. He can also issue temporary bridge licenses through our emergency protocol system EPT-200. I'm transferring you now.
406. Of course. Marcus Chen speaking. I've reviewed your case file CS-49821-TK and I can see the activation delay on your Enterprise License Package. I have full authority to resolve this immediately.
407. I'm initiating emergency activation protocol right now. Your fifteen licenses under contract number CNT-885412-JM will be fully active within ten minutes, not an hour. I'm also adding three complimentary backup licenses.
408. You'll receive confirmation at your registered email, jmorrison@techcorp.com, within five minutes. The license keys will be in attachment file LIC-PACK-7700-A. Additionally, I'm assigning you priority support status for the next six months.
409. The delay originated from a validation error in our automated system affecting batch BV-1100 through BV-1150 yesterday. We've already implemented a fix, and I'm adding a credit of $500 to your account as an apology.
410. Certainly. I'm sending a detailed report to your account manager, David Park, at extension 4521, and scheduling a follow-up call for Monday to review your account settings. Your case has been flagged as priority resolution PR-GOLD-55.
411. You're very welcome, Ms. Morrison. I've just confirmed all fifteen licenses are now active in system panel SP-7700-LIVE. My direct line is 800-555-0147 extension 301 if you need anything else. Best of luck with tomorrow's presentation.
412. Okay okay, I can definitely look into that billing issue for you, though I should mention that anything past 60 days can be... Let me pull up your account here, what's the name?
413. Got it, no judgment at all, these things happen more than you'd think actually, so I'm seeing here account number 4429-8851-PA and you mentioned September, which specific charges are we looking at?
414. Right right, I see what you're referring to now, transaction IDs 88421-SEP and 88423-SEP both on September 14th for $79.99 each, and honestly I wish I had better news but our standard refund window is 60 days which would've ended November 13th...
415. Well, not necessarily, I'm looking at your history here and you've been with us since 2021, perfect payment record, never had an issue before, so what I can potentially do is escalate this to our retention team with case number RET-9981-24...
416. I can't guarantee anything but between you and me, when I flag it with code E7 for loyal customer duplicate billing, they approve about 85% of these, especially since the system shows both charges originated from the same IP address within 3 minutes...
417. Typically 24 to 48 hours via email, they'll send the decision to the address on file which shows as p.patterson at gmail, and if approved the credit appears within 3 to 5 business days on your original payment method ending in 7234.
418. Honestly we try to make it right when we can, and your account shows zero disputes, zero late payments, current lifetime value of $2,847 so yeah, this should be pretty straightforward for the team to approve.
419. It adds up over three years doesn't it, but look, that's exactly why I'm optimistic about your case, reference number RET-9981-24, just keep that handy when you get the email...
420. No problem at all, these duplicate charges are frustrating and September feels recent even though it's December now, but we should get you sorted, anything else I can help with today?
421. Absolutely, happy to help, and you should see that email within 48 hours max, probably sooner since I'm submitting it now at 2:47 PM Eastern, have a great rest of your day!
422. Thank you for contacting us. I apologize for the difficulty you're experiencing with our self-service portal. Let me pull up your account immediately and assist you directly.
423. I understand the urgency. I'm accessing your account now using reference number ACC-8847-PQ. May I verify your email address and the last four digits of your phone number on file?
424. Perfect, thank you. I can see your account status code shows SVC-771 which indicates the security question module failed to sync after our recent system update on November 12th.
425. I'm initiating an immediate password reset bypass using protocol PWR-445-X. You'll receive a secure link to your email within the next sixty seconds that remains active for thirty minutes.
426. Absolutely not.
427. Yes, I recommend updating those once you regain access. I've flagged your account with service note TSN-9902 which will prompt you to create new security questions upon your first login.
428. Not at all. The synchronization issue affecting batch users B-7000 through B-8500 has been permanently resolved as of this morning, and I'm manually correcting your specific profile now.
429. Yes, please do. I'll remain available to ensure everything processes correctly, and I can verify your access is fully restored using our diagnostic tool DT-226.
430. Excellent. I can confirm full account access on my end with all features operational, showing green status across all twenty-seven service modules in panel MSP-100-A.
431. You're very welcome. I've also added priority support tag PST-500 to your account for the next ninety days, which provides direct agent access if you experience any further technical issues.
432. Oh gosh, I can totally understand the frustration there. Let me just, um... what's the word... investigate this for you. Could you share your order number so I can kind of see what happened?
433. Perfect, thank you. Okay so I'm pulling that up now and, hmm, I'm seeing... oh wow, yeah you're absolutely right. Three attempted deliveries on November 18th, 20th, and 22nd, all marked as, er, "customer unavailable" which is probably not— I mean that doesn't sound accurate, does it?
434. Right, right. So what I think happened here is, uh... how do I explain this... sometimes our delivery partners have issues with certain zones— yours is zone R44— and they sort of default to that status even when, well, even when it's not true. Let me check something else real quick.
435. Oh no no, please don't apologize! This is genuinely, like, one of those situations where you have every right to be upset. Hmm, so I can see your package weighs 3 pounds 7 ounces and it's currently back at our distribution center DC-881. What I'd like to do is, er... actually, hold on, let me check what options I have here.
436. Okay so, basically what I can offer— and I think you'll probably find this fair— is we can either resend with guaranteed next-day delivery by December 2nd, or... actually, you know what? Given the hassle you've been through, I could arguably do a full refund and still resend it. Would that, um, would that work for you?
437. Absolutely! The refund amount would be $127.83, and that'll process in, mmm, maybe 2-3 business days? And then your replacement order— let me create that now— that'll be... okay, new order number is ORD-4429-BX-R2, scheduled for delivery tomorrow before 8 PM.
438. Of course! So just to kind of walk through this: you'll get an email confirmation for both the refund— transaction ID RF-20241128-447— and the new shipment. And this time I'm putting a special note, er, let me phrase this right... "Multiple delivery failures - ensure successful delivery" in our system.
439. Well, I mean, three failed attempts is just... that's not okay, you know? Oh, and I almost forgot— I'm also adding a $25 credit to your account, code COMP-447-DEC, for future purchases. It's sort of our way of saying sorry for the inconvenience.
440. Aww, you're very welcome! So essentially everything should be, hmm, all set now. Your tracking number for tomorrow's delivery is TRK-88429-QXL, and if there's any issue— though I really don't think there will be— just reference case number CS-20241128-4470 and we'll prioritize it immediately.
441. That's so kind of you to say! Honestly, customers like you who are, well, understanding about these situations make my job so much easier. Is there maybe anything else I can help with today, or are we all good with the refund and redelivery?
442. Good afternoon, and thank you for contacting us. I'd be happy to help you with a price adjustment. May I have your order number so I can review the purchase details?
443. Thank you. I've located your order for the ProBook Elite model PB-550X, purchased on November 3rd for $1,299. I can see the current promotional price is $1,099, representing a $200 difference.
444. Our price protection policy covers purchases within 14 days of a price reduction. Since you purchased on November 3rd and today is November 10th, you're well within the 7-day window and eligible for the full adjustment.
445. I'll process the adjustment immediately. The $200 credit will be issued to your original payment method within 3 to 5 business days. You'll receive a confirmation email to your registered address within the next 30 minutes.
446. Not at all. Your warranty remains valid from the original purchase date of November 3rd, giving you the full 2-year coverage until November 2026. Your return window also remains unchanged.
447. Absolutely. Your price adjustment reference number is PA-7264-RF89. This will appear on your confirmation email and can be used to track the refund status through our customer portal.
448. We offer PriceGuard Plus membership for $49 annually, which extends price protection to 30 days and includes additional benefits like free expedited shipping on all orders over $50.
449. Certainly. I can add PriceGuard Plus to your account effective immediately. With the $200 adjustment you're receiving today, the $49 annual fee represents excellent value for future purchases.
450. Perfect. I've added PriceGuard Plus to your account, active through November 10th, 2025. Your membership number is PGP-4521-WK33, and you'll receive a welcome email with all the program benefits.
451. You're very welcome. To summarize, you'll receive the $200 price adjustment within 5 business days, and your PriceGuard Plus membership is now active. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
452. Good morning, and thank you for contacting us. I sincerely apologize for the service disruption you experienced. Let me pull up your account details and review the outage incident from Tuesday, October 22nd.
453. I completely understand the severity of this situation, especially with your quarterly reporting requirements. I can see your account number B-47291-ENT shows you're on our Enterprise Plus plan with a 99.9% uptime guarantee, which we clearly failed to meet.
454. Absolutely correct. Based on the twelve-hour outage from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST, you're entitled to a service credit of $4,750, which represents 25% of your monthly service fee plus additional compensation for exceeding our maximum resolution time.
455. I'll process this immediately with priority status. The credit will appear on your account within 24 hours under reference number CMP-2024-10-8847, and it will automatically apply to your October 31st billing cycle.
456. Certainly. I'm generating a formal incident report right now that includes the root cause analysis, timeline of events, and compensation details. This will be sent to your registered email within the next 30 minutes to document case number INC-782451.
457. Excellent question. We've implemented redundant failover systems at data center locations DC-14 and DC-15, upgraded our monitoring protocols, and your account has been flagged for priority routing through our most stable infrastructure tier.
458. Of course.
459. I'm assigning you a dedicated account specialist who will monitor your service proactively. Their direct line is 1-866-550-4421 extension 7829, and they'll reach out within two business days to establish a communication protocol.
460. To confirm, your total compensation is $4,750 applied as a service credit, the formal documentation will arrive at your email by 11:45 AM EST today, and your dedicated specialist will contact you by Thursday, October 24th.
461. You're very welcome, and again, I sincerely apologize for the disruption to your operations. I've documented all of these arrangements in your account, and your confirmation number for this entire transaction is TXN-9847-QRS-2024. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
462. Good afternoon, and thank you for contacting us. I understand your concern about receiving paper statements when you requested paperless billing. Let me access your account right away to investigate this issue. May I have your account number to get started?
463. Thank you for providing account number 88274-B. I can see your account was flagged for paperless billing as of March 15th, reference code ECO-2847-PLB. However, there appears to be a processing error that overrode your preference during our recent system migration on October 2nd.
464. I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for this error. I'm immediately correcting this in our system under ticket number TKT-981573-ENV. Additionally, I'm adding a priority flag to ensure this never happens again, and I'll arrange for secure shredding of those paper statements at no cost to you.
465. Absolutely. I'll generate an official compliance letter with reference number DOC-4521-CERT within the next hour confirming your paperless enrollment date and our error. This document will include our environmental certification number ENV-ISO-14001-2023 and my direct contact information as your account specialist.
466. Certainly. I've implemented a permanent override lock on your account, confirmation code LOCK-8847-NPP, which prevents any paper generation regardless of system updates. Your account now has our highest level environmental protection status, and I'm documenting this in compliance report CR-2024-10-1847.
467. Excellent question. We'll issue carbon offset credits to your account under program number GREEN-OFFSET-7734 to neutralize the environmental impact. Additionally, I'm enrolling you in our premium sustainability partnership program at no charge, which provides quarterly environmental impact reports under tracking code SUSTAIN-PREM-2024.
468. All documents will be available in your secure portal within one hour under the documents tab, filing reference DOCS-ENV-8847. I'm also sending them directly to your registered email address with encryption key ENC-7829-SEC, and you'll receive an SMS notification to the number ending in 4782 when they're ready.
469. Absolutely. The documentation I'm providing includes our liability acceptance statement under case number LIAB-ACCEPT-9982-B, which explicitly states this was our error. I'm also preparing a letter from our compliance department, signed by our Chief Sustainability Officer, reference number CSO-LTR-2024-1098, confirming your continuous paperless status since enrollment.
470. Of course.
471. You'll receive confirmation email ECM-8847-COMPLETE within thirty minutes showing all corrections. My direct extension is 7714, and I'm assigning myself as your permanent account specialist under designation SPEC-7714-PERM. I'll personally monitor your account through your audit period and call you Friday to ensure everything meets your requirements.
472. Good morning, and thank you for reaching out. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account right away. May I have your email address associated with the account?
473. Thank you, Ms. Chen. I have your account here, reference number ACC-8274-MPC. I can see multiple verification attempts since Monday, October 23rd. Let me review what's causing the rejections.
474. I see the issue now. The system is flagging a resolution problem with your uploaded documents. They need to be at least 300 DPI for our security protocols. The ones you've submitted are showing as 72 DPI.
475. Absolutely, I can guide you through this. You have two options. First, you can use our mobile app version 4.2.1 or higher, which automatically adjusts image quality. Alternatively, I can send you a secure upload link.
476. Certainly. I'm generating a secure verification link with code VER-9823-XKL right now. This link will remain active for 48 hours and allows direct high-resolution uploads from any device.
477. Just the driver's license will be sufficient. I've already validated your utility bill from submission 3 on October 24th. Once you upload the license, verification typically completes within 15 minutes.
478. Yes, you'll receive two confirmations. First, an SMS to your registered number ending in 7745, then an email with your permanent verification code starting with PVC. Both should arrive within 20 minutes of successful upload.
479. I've added a priority flag to your account, reference note PR-4521-B. This ensures your submission goes to our expedited queue. Also, I'm applying a one-time courtesy credit of $25 for the inconvenience you've experienced.
480. The secure link has just been sent. You should receive it within 2 minutes at margaret.chen at techcorp dot com. The email subject line will be "Secure Verification Portal - Reference VER-9823-XKL."
481. You're very welcome, Ms. Chen. I'm confident we'll have your account fully verified today. If you encounter any issues with the new upload, please reference case number CS-10276-MC and we'll assist you immediately. Have a wonderful day.
482. Oh! Oh okay—let me—actually wait I see what's happening here your account AC-9847-VX2 has a fraud hold that's triggering at exactly $150.00 which is probably why it keeps—yeah there it is!
483. Right right so—um—here's the thing the system flagged three attempts at exactly $150.00 from IP address 74.203.18.92 and it thinks—no wait actually—it thinks someone's testing your card.
484. I know I know it's—*exhales*—stupid honestly but I can fix this right now just need to verify your billing zip is still 48226 and then boom fraud department releases it.
485. Okay okay so I'm—let me just—submitting the override now case number CSE-4492-MNK and it'll be active in, um, approximately 4 to 7 minutes max.
486. Oh absolutely—actually no wait even better—I just got the confirmation code CNF-8823-PP which means it's already processing so maybe like 2 minutes tops.
487. Actually you know what—er—refresh your app in exactly 90 seconds and you'll see the hold removed and your available balance should show $1,847.32 again.
488. I'm just—I'm really good at this—um—sorry that sounded weird but I mean I've released probably 200 fraud holds this week alone so I know exactly how long each status code takes.
489. Yeah it's—*sharp inhale*—honestly we had a breach at vendor VND-7734 last month affected about 11,000 cards so we're being super careful but catching some false positives.
490. Oh! No no no—actually wait—your card ending in 4429 wasn't in that batch but, um, if you want I can overnight you a replacement arrives tomorrow by 10:30am just for peace of mind?
491. Perfect perfect expedited order EXP-9901-LK2 is placed and just—er—sorry about all this truly the system's just trying to protect you but I know it's annoying when you're just trying to buy groceries!
492. Good morning. I'll assist you with that transfer right away. May I have your account number and the current account holder's full name for verification?
493. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell. I've located account 771-294-886 showing you as the primary holder with our Premium Business tier. To proceed with the ownership transfer, I'll need the new account holder's full legal name and their contact information.
494. I understand your expectation, and I appreciate that feedback. David Chen's contact information would include email address and phone number. Additionally, our security protocol requires verification code TRN-8847-VF to be sent to your registered email address.
495. Perfect. I'm sending the verification code TRN-8847-VF to your registered email sarah.mitchell@alphalogistics.com right now. Once you confirm that code, we'll need Mr. Chen to complete form DOC-5521-A within 48 hours to accept ownership.
496. Excellent, verified. Mr. Chen will receive an email at dchen@alphalogistics.com with transfer document DOC-5521-A attached. He'll need to provide his tax identification number, sign electronically, and complete identity verification through our secure portal.
497. Absolutely. Your existing service agreement SA-2847-PREM dated March 2023 transfers completely intact, including your negotiated rate of $847.50 monthly and all custom API limits. The only change will be the billing contact and account ownership designation.
498. Once Mr. Chen submits form DOC-5521-A, our compliance team processes transfers within 24 business hours. You'll both receive confirmation emails with the updated account documentation showing reference number ACC-TRANS-981247 for your records.
499. Certainly. All technical configurations remain unchanged. Your API keys, webhook endpoints, and the 47 integration tokens currently active on account 771-294-886 will continue functioning without interruption throughout and after the transfer process.
500. Of course. I'm generating summary document SUM-4485-TC right now containing all transfer details, timeline, and confirmation that technical services remain unaffected. You'll receive this at sarah.mitchell@alphalogistics.com within the next five minutes.
501. Excellent. Once Mr. Chen completes DOC-5521-A by tomorrow afternoon, the transfer will be finalized by Thursday at latest. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding account 771-294-886 today, Ms. Mitchell?
# --- MONOLOGUE (continued) ---
502. [surprised] Oh my God, Sarah? I can't believe you're calling! [warm] No no no, of course I have time—are you kidding? [pause] Wait, what do you mean I saved you? [confused] I didn't—I just, you know, I was just there when you needed someone to listen. [short pause] You're crying, oh honey, don't cry. [empathetically] Or wait, are these happy tears? [relieved] Okay good, because you're making me tear up too. [sniffle] You moved to Colorado? And started your own business? [extremely happy] Sarah, that's incredible! [laugh] You always talked about the mountains but I never thought you'd actually... wow. [pause] No, I'm not taking credit for any of this. [warm] You did all the hard work. I just, um, I just reminded you who you were before everything got so complicated. [getting emotional] Stop it, now you're really going to make me cry. [crying while speaking] I'm so proud of you. [pause] Yeah, of course I'll come visit. [laugh hysterically] Are you kidding? Free ski lessons from my newly adventurous best friend? [smiling speaking] I'm already looking at flights.
503. [extremely happy] Look at him up there. My baby brother. Doctor Marcus Chen. [laugh] God, that sounds so official now. [warm] Eight years ago he was sleeping on my couch, studying until 4 AM with those ridiculous flashcards everywhere. And I was picking up extra shifts, telling myself it's fine, it's totally fine, we'll make it work. [pause] There were moments when I thought, um... when I wondered if we were crazy, you know? [quietly] Like when my car broke down and I had to choose between fixing it or his tuition payment. [laugh softly] I took the bus for three months. [emotional] But watching him now, in that cap and gown, shaking the dean's hand— [sniffle] Mom would've been so proud. [crying while speaking] She always said he had the hands of a healer. Even when he was little. [pause] And I got to help make it happen. Me. His big sister who, uh, who never even finished college. [extremely happy] But that's my brother up there. Doctor Chen. [laugh] And next week he starts his residency at Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins! [warm] Worth every penny. Every single penny.
504. [quietly] Okay, so this valve... it's completely seized. [pause] God, ninety years of—I mean, you can actually feel the history in this brass. [warm] The engraving says "1934, Chicago Musical Instrument Company," which is... wow, that's before they even became part of Conn. [short pause] The pistons are, um, they're basically frozen solid from decades of oxidation, but I think if I just... [slowly] there we go. [relieved] First valve is moving. 
505. Maria called me this morning. She saw him at the casino. [confused] My client, the one with the bakery proposal? [pause] Three thousand dollars for commercial ovens, that's what he wrote. Equipment financing. I have his business plan right here, profit projections, everything. [bitter] God, I actually defended him to the review committee. [sigh] They had concerns about his credit history and I said—I said people deserve second chances, you know? That microfinance is about, um... about believing in people who traditional banks won't touch. [angry] But gambling? Really? [frustrated] That money was supposed to help his family, supposed to create jobs in his neighborhood. [slowly] And now I have to report this. [regretful] I mean, obviously I have to report it. [pause] The thing is, I've seen what happens to these families when the loans default. His kids, his wife—they don't even know yet, do they? [very sad] Twenty-three years I've been doing this work. [quietly] Twenty-three years of believing that if you just give people a chance, they'll... [trailing off] [sigh] I guess I'm the one who gambled, really. Gambled on trust. And er... apparently I lost too.
506. So they're back together. [sigh] And apparently it's serious this time because, well... there's a ring involved. [bitter] I keep telling myself I should be happy for her, right? [pause] But I remember—God, I remember finding her in her room that night, just sobbing. [very quietly] The way she couldn't even say his name for months. [clearing throat] And now I'm supposed to, what, shake his hand at Sunday dinners? [frustrated] Welcome him to the family? 
507. [warm] You know what's crazy? Three years ago I couldn't even open a bank account without feeling like everyone knew. [pause] Like they could just tell somehow. [empathetically] But Ms. Rivera, she never once made us feel ashamed about where we came from. [smiling speaking] She'd say "Your past gave you skills most MBAs don't have." [laugh] And she was right! Customer service, reading people, managing difficult situations—I mean, I basically had a PhD in dealing with people. [passionately] The program wasn't just about, um, filling out business licenses either. [relieved] They helped with everything—credit repair, professional wardrobes, even therapy if you wanted it. [excited] My bakery opens next month! Can you believe that? [cheerful] Me, with my own legitimate business, paying taxes, the whole thing. [sniffle] Sometimes I walk past the storefront and I just... [crying while speaking] I never thought I'd have something that was really mine, you know? [confidently] Something I built that nobody could take away. [very sincerely] There's twelve of us from the program running businesses now. [happy] Real businesses. A florist, two consultants, even someone doing IT support. [animated] We meet for coffee sometimes and it's like—we made it out. [pause] We actually made it.
508. Eight hours today. Eight hours of pushing carts in the rain while this woman literally stepped around me like I was, I don't know, part of the pavement. [bitter] Didn't even look up from her phone when I said "excuse me." Just kept walking. [sigh] And the thing is, right, I get it—everyone's busy, everyone's got their own stuff, but... hmm, it's like I'm not even human to them sometimes. This guy today, he watched me struggling with these carts that got all jammed up, and he just stood there. Waiting. [frustrated] Like I'm some kind of cart-retrieving robot or something. 
509. Three generations. Three generations of my family worked these beds, and now they're telling me it's over because of some chemical plant twenty miles upriver. [bitter] Twenty miles. That's not even my county. [pause] The letter came yesterday—"immediate cessation of all harvesting activities." Like that. Like I'm the one who poisoned the water. [angry] Do you know how many tests I've paid for out of my own pocket? How many times I've proved my oysters are clean? [sigh] Doesn't matter. The whole bay's designated now. Contaminated zone. [very sad] I keep thinking about my grandfather, how he taught me to read the tides, to know when the shells were ready just by the sound they made underwater. All that knowledge, it's just... what's it for now? [frustrated] The lawyer wants eight thousand just to file the appeal. Eight thousand I don't have because I haven't been able to harvest for two months already. [quietly] Thirty-seven years I've been doing this. It's not just my job, it's—it's who I am. [pause] [exhausted] And the company that actually did this? They'll pay some fine, probably. Cost of doing business. While I lose everything.
510. [gasp softly] They gave it to me. The senior director position, they actually— they actually gave it to me. Five years of killing myself for this and it's... it's mine. [pause] God, Sarah's face when they announced it. She thought she had it locked down. [laugh] I should be ecstatic right now, shouldn't I? This is the thing, this is what I've been— [trailing off] But I'm standing here looking at this office, my new office with the view I always wanted, and I just feel... nothing? [confused] No that's not right, I feel something, it's just not, um... it's not happiness. [slowly] When did this place become so suffocating? When did I start hating the sound of Jim's laugh from accounting? Or dreading Monday morning meetings? [bitter] "Congratulations," they said. "You've earned this." Have I though? Or have I just, uh, wasted five years becoming someone I don't even recognize? [sigh] The irony is perfect. The exact moment I get everything I thought I wanted is the moment I realize I need to leave. [sad] I can't do another five years here. I can't even do another five months. [whispering] What the hell am I going to tell my wife?
511. Wait, what? They're calling me about... [shocked] Oh my God. [pause] The transplant worked? [shaky voice] You're saying they're—they're okay? [gasp softly] I can't even... um, I need to sit down. [overwhelmed] This is real? [crying while speaking] You're telling me that person is alive because of... [sniffle] Sorry, I just—wow. I never thought I'd actually get this call, you know? [relieved] When I signed up for the registry, it was like, what, five years ago? [warm] And honestly, I'd kind of forgotten about it until they called me for the match. [emotional] The whole process was, um... it was intense but I kept thinking about this stranger out there who needed this. [very sincerely] And now they're... they're going to be okay? [gasp] Can you tell me anything about them? [hesitantly] I mean, I know there's privacy stuff but... [trailing off] God, I keep picturing different people, you know? [soft] Maybe someone's parent or, er, someone's kid... [cry] And they get to live now. [laughing through tears] My hip was sore for like two weeks and I was being such a baby about it, but they—they get their whole life back. [extremely happy] This is the best phone call I've ever gotten. [pause] Can I... can I write them a letter or something? [hopeful] I just want them to know that, um, that I'm rooting for them. [very quietly] That someone out here cares about them getting better. [smiling speaking] Thank you for calling me. [warm] Thank you so much.
512. [anxious] Okay, okay, we've got seventeen hours before those ventilators need to be at the hospital. [pause] The flight from Shanghai is delayed—weather, they're saying four more hours but, um... I don't trust that. [frustrated] We can't wait. [quickly] Look, I'm rerouting through Seoul, there's a cargo plane leaving in—wait, let me check—ninety minutes. [very quickly] If we can get the trucks to the airport by then, we can... yeah, we can make this work. [relieved] Oh thank God, the customs paperwork is already cleared. [sigh] That would've been, uh, that would've been a disaster. [passionately] These are kids, you know? Pediatric ICU is down to their last three units. [shaky voice] I keep thinking about—no, focus. [confidently] Alright, I need drivers. [loudly] Marco! Get me three trucks, refrigerated, NOW! [pause] What do you mean they're all out? [angry] Are you kidding me right now? [long pause] Wait, wait... what about the pharmaceutical run? [excited] Those trucks are coming back empty from Boston! [laughs] Yes! Redirect them to JFK, tell them it's, um, it's emergency medical. [warm] We're gonna get these supplies there. [very sincerely] We have to.
513. [bitter] They sent the email at 4:47 PM. [pause] The day before my sabbatical. [laugh] I mean, who does that? Seven years of preliminary work, all those grant proposals, the peer reviews that said—what was it—"groundbreaking potential for the field." [sarcastic] But apparently the budget committee disagrees. [frustrated] I already told my graduate students I'd fund them through the summer! [speeding up] I promised them, I gave them my word that this was happening, that we were finally going to get the longitudinal data we need. [angry] And now what do I tell them? [pause] "Sorry, politics happened"? [very sad] Maria turned down a position at Columbia to stay on this project. [shaky voice] She believed in this research as much as I did. God, the lab equipment is already ordered—it's, um... it's literally being shipped tomorrow. [furious] Thirty thousand dollars of specialized sensors that I now have to somehow return or eat the cost of myself! [quietly] My wife doesn't even know yet. [regretful] She's been so patient, planning this whole year around my sabbatical schedule, and now I have to walk in there and tell her that... [trailing off] [bitter] Twenty-three years at this institution. [slowly] Twenty-three years of committee work, teaching overloads, playing nice with the administration. [laugh hysterically] And this is what I get. [exhausted] Maybe it's time to just... maybe the consulting offers are still on the table.
514. [bitter] Three million dollar contract. Three million. I just saved everyone's job, and they celebrate by cutting Maya's health insurance. [pause] I mean, what am I supposed to do with that? [frustrated] Hey congrats on the biggest win of your career, oh and by the way, your best friend can't afford her kid's asthma medication anymore. [sarcastic] Perfect timing, really. [sigh] And the worst part is they knew—they knew I was close with her when they made me present it to the board. [angry] Like I'm supposed to stand there all proud while they're planning to gut her benefits package. [short pause] God, Maya was so... she was trying to be happy for me. [very sad] She actually congratulated me. Can you believe that? [regretful] I should've said something in the meeting. But what, risk the whole contract? [confused] I don't even know if that would've helped or just, um... just made them fire her completely instead. [quietly] Twenty years she's been there. [pause] Twenty years. [upset] And this is how they thank her—by making me the hero while they screw her over. [exhausted] I can't even look at that contract without feeling sick. [trailing off] Some victory this turned out to be...
515. [hesitantly] Hey, um, I know this is kind of weird calling you like this, but I just... I wanted to say thank you. [pause] I know we ended up going with SunPower instead, and I feel sort of bad about that, but honestly? [very sincerely] You were the only salesperson who didn't try to pressure us or, you know, make us feel stupid for asking questions. [chuckle] Everyone else was like "sign today or lose this amazing deal forever!" But you actually, um... you told us to take our time. [warm] You even pointed out that thing about the warranty that the other guys were trying to hide. [sigh] Look, I'm not gonna lie, we went with them because of the, uh, the financing thing—they had that zero down option we needed. But I keep thinking about how you said "this is a twenty-year relationship, not just a sale." [pause] That really stuck with me. And when SunPower tried to sneak in those extra fees at signing? I knew what to look for because of what you'd warned us about. [laugh] So yeah, I just... I guess I wanted you to know that even though you didn't get the sale, you made a difference. [friendly] If anyone asks me about solar, I'm sending them to you. [very sincerely] People like you are, um... they're rare in this business.
516. [relieved] Oh my God, I can't believe I caught that. [pause] Nobody else was looking at the calendar overlap—I mean, how did no one notice the CEO double-booked herself for Seoul AND the board meeting? [anxious] That would've been... Jesus, that would've been catastrophic. [laugh] 
517. [anxious] They need someone who can rappel down a cliff face in a storm. Someone who knows field medicine. Someone who can navigate in zero visibility. [pause] Twenty years of doing things I'm not proud of, and now— now they're calling me because those exact skills are what's going to save those hikers. [bitter] Funny how that works, right? All that time people looked at me like I was, um, like I was something dangerous. Something to avoid. [short pause] And they weren't wrong. [quietly] But right now, in this moment, those kids trapped up there don't care about my past. They just need someone who can get them out alive. [speeding up] I know that terrain. I've extracted people from worse situations—granted, those were different circumstances, but the mechanics are the same. Rope work is rope work. Trauma care is trauma care. [determined] The helicopter can't reach them, search and rescue is overwhelmed, and I'm sitting here with all this training that's finally, uh... finally useful for something good. [laugh] God, my therapist is going to have a field day with this. [confidently] But first, I'm getting those kids off that mountain.
518. [relieved] Oh my God, I finally got it. The whole system just... clicked. [laugh] After three weeks of staring at this software, it actually makes sense now! [excited] Wait wait wait, if I run this query with the income parameters and— [gasp softly] Oh. Oh wow. There are, um... there are forty-seven families in our database who qualify for expanded coverage. [very quietly] Forty-seven. 
519. [exhausted] Another denial letter signed today. This woman, she's... she has MS, can barely hold a pen, and I'm sitting here typing up how she doesn't meet criteria because she can still, technically, walk twenty feet. [bitter] Twenty feet. [pause] That's what we measure a life by now.
520. [gasp loudly] Oh my God, did you see what just happened? [very quickly] That kid was about to run straight into the—I mean, those carts were rolling so fast down that slope. [relieved] Thank God that attendant was paying attention. [pause]
