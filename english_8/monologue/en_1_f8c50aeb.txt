Subject: Your disability examiner position requires you to deny benefits to people you know genuinely need them

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] Another denial letter signed today. This woman, she's... she has MS, can barely hold a pen, and I'm sitting here typing up how she doesn't meet criteria because she can still, technically, walk twenty feet. [bitter] Twenty feet. [pause] That's what we measure a life by now.

The guidelines say if someone can do "simple tasks" they're not disabled enough. But they don't see her, um... they don't see her crying in my office because she can't pick up her grandkids anymore. [frustrated] And I have to sit there, smile, take notes, knowing I'm about to destroy her last hope for any financial stability.

[sigh] You know what the worst part is? Tomorrow there'll be another one. Some veteran missing a leg who can still, uh... who can still "theoretically perform sedentary work." [angry] Theoretically! Like anyone's actually going to hire him.

I keep telling myself I'm just doing my job, but honestly? [very quietly] I hate myself a little more each day. My supervisor says the system works, that we're preventing fraud, but... [trailing off] I don't know, maybe ninety percent of these people desperately need help and I'm the one standing in their way. [regretful] God, what am I even doing with my life?
