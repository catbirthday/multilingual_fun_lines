=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Wait, what? They're calling me about... [shocked] Oh my God. [pause] The transplant worked? [shaky voice] You're saying they're—they're okay? [gasp softly] I can't even... um, I need to sit down. [overwhelmed] This is real? [crying while speaking] You're telling me that person is alive because of... [sniffle] Sorry, I just—wow. I never thought I'd actually get this call, you know? [relieved] When I signed up for the registry, it was like, what, five years ago? [warm] And honestly, I'd kind of forgotten about it until they called me for the match. [emotional] The whole process was, um... it was intense but I kept thinking about this stranger out there who needed this. [very sincerely] And now they're... they're going to be okay? [gasp] Can you tell me anything about them? [hesitantly] I mean, I know there's privacy stuff but... [trailing off] God, I keep picturing different people, you know? [soft] Maybe someone's parent or, er, someone's kid... [cry] And they get to live now. [laughing through tears] My hip was sore for like two weeks and I was being such a baby about it, but they—they get their whole life back. [extremely happy] This is the best phone call I've ever gotten. [pause] Can I... can I write them a letter or something? [hopeful] I just want them to know that, um, that I'm rooting for them. [very quietly] That someone out here cares about them getting better. [smiling speaking] Thank you for calling me. [warm] Thank you so much.
