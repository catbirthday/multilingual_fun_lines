Subject: Getting the promotion you always wanted just as you realize you don't actually want to work here anymore

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] They gave it to me. The senior director position, they actually— they actually gave it to me. Five years of killing myself for this and it's... it's mine. [pause] God, Sarah's face when they announced it. She thought she had it locked down. [laugh] I should be ecstatic right now, shouldn't I? This is the thing, this is what I've been— [trailing off] But I'm standing here looking at this office, my new office with the view I always wanted, and I just feel... nothing? [confused] No that's not right, I feel something, it's just not, um... it's not happiness. [slowly] When did this place become so suffocating? When did I start hating the sound of Jim's laugh from accounting? Or dreading Monday morning meetings? [bitter] "Congratulations," they said. "You've earned this." Have I though? Or have I just, uh, wasted five years becoming someone I don't even recognize? [sigh] The irony is perfect. The exact moment I get everything I thought I wanted is the moment I realize I need to leave. [sad] I can't do another five years here. I can't even do another five months. [whispering] What the hell am I going to tell my wife?
