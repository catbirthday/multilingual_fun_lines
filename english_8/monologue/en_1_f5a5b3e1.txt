Subject: A customer thanking you for your solar sales honesty even though they bought from a competitor

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [hesitantly] Hey, um, I know this is kind of weird calling you like this, but I just... I wanted to say thank you. [pause] I know we ended up going with SunPower instead, and I feel sort of bad about that, but honestly? [very sincerely] You were the only salesperson who didn't try to pressure us or, you know, make us feel stupid for asking questions. [chuckle] Everyone else was like "sign today or lose this amazing deal forever!" But you actually, um... you told us to take our time. [warm] You even pointed out that thing about the warranty that the other guys were trying to hide. [sigh] Look, I'm not gonna lie, we went with them because of the, uh, the financing thing—they had that zero down option we needed. But I keep thinking about how you said "this is a twenty-year relationship, not just a sale." [pause] That really stuck with me. And when SunPower tried to sneak in those extra fees at signing? I knew what to look for because of what you'd warned us about. [laugh] So yeah, I just... I guess I wanted you to know that even though you didn't get the sale, you made a difference. [friendly] If anyone asks me about solar, I'm sending them to you. [very sincerely] People like you are, um... they're rare in this business.
