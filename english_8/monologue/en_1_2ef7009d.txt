Subject: Your cart attendant quick thinking just prevented a child from getting seriously hurt

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp loudly] Oh my God, did you see what just happened? [very quickly] That kid was about to run straight into the—I mean, those carts were rolling so fast down that slope. [relieved] Thank God that attendant was paying attention. [pause] 

[anxious] For a second there I thought... ugh, I can't even think about what could've happened. [shaky voice] The way he just dropped everything and sprinted over there. [long pause] 

[very sincerely] You know what? We don't appreciate these people enough. [warm] Like, he probably makes minimum wage, and he just—without even hesitating, he threw himself in front of those carts. [sniffle] The kid's mom didn't even see it coming, she was looking at her phone and... mm, I'm not judging, it happens so fast with kids. [empathetically] One second they're right there, the next they're halfway across the parking lot.

[excited] I'm definitely telling the manager about this! [confidently] That guy deserves, I don't know, a raise or something. [trailing off] The way he scooped that little boy up with one arm while stopping the carts with his hip... 

[extremely happy] Look, the kid's laughing now! [chuckle] He has no idea how close that was. [very quietly] Thank God for people who actually pay attention.
