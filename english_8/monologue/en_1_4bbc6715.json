[empathetically] But Ms. Rivera, she never once made us feel ashamed about where we came from. [smiling speaking] She'd say \"Your past gave you skills most MBAs don't have.\" [laugh] And she was right! Customer service, reading people, managing difficult situations—I mean, I basically had a PhD in dealing with people. [passionately] The program wasn't just about, um, filling out business licenses either. [relieved] They helped with everything—credit repair, professional wardrobes, even therapy if you wanted it. [excited] My bakery opens next month! Can you believe that? [cheerful] Me, with my own legitimate business, paying taxes, the whole thing. [sniffle] Sometimes I walk past the storefront and I just... [crying while speaking] I never thought I'd have something that was really mine, you know? [confidently] Something I built that nobody could take away. [very sincerely] There's twelve of us from the program running businesses now. [happy] Real businesses. A florist, two consultants, even someone doing IT support. [animated] We meet for coffee sometimes and it's like—we made it out. [pause] We actually made it."
