Subject: Your mercenary skills being exactly what's needed to rescue hikers trapped in a natural disaster

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] They need someone who can rappel down a cliff face in a storm. Someone who knows field medicine. Someone who can navigate in zero visibility. [pause] Twenty years of doing things I'm not proud of, and now— now they're calling me because those exact skills are what's going to save those hikers. [bitter] Funny how that works, right? All that time people looked at me like I was, um, like I was something dangerous. Something to avoid. [short pause] And they weren't wrong. [quietly] But right now, in this moment, those kids trapped up there don't care about my past. They just need someone who can get them out alive. [speeding up] I know that terrain. I've extracted people from worse situations—granted, those were different circumstances, but the mechanics are the same. Rope work is rope work. Trauma care is trauma care. [determined] The helicopter can't reach them, search and rescue is overwhelmed, and I'm sitting here with all this training that's finally, uh... finally useful for something good. [laugh] God, my therapist is going to have a field day with this. [confidently] But first, I'm getting those kids off that mountain.
