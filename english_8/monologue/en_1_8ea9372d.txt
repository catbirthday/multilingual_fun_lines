=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] Okay, okay, we've got seventeen hours before those ventilators need to be at the hospital. [pause] The flight from Shanghai is delayed—weather, they're saying four more hours but, um... I don't trust that. [frustrated] We can't wait. [quickly] Look, I'm rerouting through Seoul, there's a cargo plane leaving in—wait, let me check—ninety minutes. [very quickly] If we can get the trucks to the airport by then, we can... yeah, we can make this work. [relieved] Oh thank God, the customs paperwork is already cleared. [sigh] That would've been, uh, that would've been a disaster. [passionately] These are kids, you know? Pediatric ICU is down to their last three units. [shaky voice] I keep thinking about—no, focus. [confidently] Alright, I need drivers. [loudly] Marco! Get me three trucks, refrigerated, NOW! [pause] What do you mean they're all out? [angry] Are you kidding me right now? [long pause] Wait, wait... what about the pharmaceutical run? [excited] Those trucks are coming back empty from Boston! [laughs] Yes! Redirect them to JFK, tell them it's, um, it's emergency medical. [warm] We're gonna get these supplies there. [very sincerely] We have to.
