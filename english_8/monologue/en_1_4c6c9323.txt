=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] Oh my God, I can't believe I caught that. [pause] Nobody else was looking at the calendar overlap—I mean, how did no one notice the CEO double-booked herself for Seoul AND the board meeting? [anxious] That would've been... Jesus, that would've been catastrophic. [laugh] 

The thing is, um, I almost didn't say anything. [hesitantly] You know how she gets when you question her schedule? But then I'm cross-referencing the travel itinerary with the—wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. [speaking fast] So yesterday morning, I'm doing my usual review, right? And I see this tiny note buried in an email thread from, like, three weeks ago about moving the board meeting up. [frustrated] Nobody flagged it! 

And I'm thinking, hmm, this can't be right. [slowly] So I start digging through everything—the investor emails, the Seoul conference registration, the board secretary's notes—and yeah, total disaster waiting to happen. [gasp softly] Fifteen million dollar acquisition on the line. 

[very quietly] I had to interrupt her workout to fix it. [chuckle] She actually thanked me. Can you believe that? [warmly] "You just saved my entire quarter," she said. [sigh] 

Sometimes I think, er... maybe we're the only ones actually paying attention to the details that matter.
