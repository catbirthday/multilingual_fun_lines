Seven years of preliminary work, all those grant proposals, the peer reviews that said—what was it—\"groundbreaking potential for the field.\" [sarcastic] But apparently the budget committee disagrees. [frustrated] I already told my graduate students I'd fund them through the summer! [speeding up] I promised them, I gave them my word that this was happening, that we were finally going to get the longitudinal data we need. [angry] And now what do I tell them? [pause] \"Sorry, politics happened\"? [very sad] Maria turned down a position at Columbia to stay on this project. [shaky voice] She believed in this research as much as I did. God, the lab equipment is already ordered—it's, um... it's literally being shipped tomorrow. [furious] Thirty thousand dollars of specialized sensors that I now have to somehow return or eat the cost of myself! [quietly] My wife doesn't even know yet. [regretful] She's been so patient, planning this whole year around my sabbatical schedule, and now I have to walk in there and tell her that... [trailing off] [bitter] Twenty-three years at this institution. [slowly] Twenty-three years of committee work, teaching overloads, playing nice with the administration. [laugh hysterically] And this is what I get. [exhausted] Maybe it's time to just... maybe the consulting offers are still on the table."
