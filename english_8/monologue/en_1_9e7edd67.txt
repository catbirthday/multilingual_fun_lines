=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [surprised] Oh my God, Sarah? I can't believe you're calling! [warm] No no no, of course I have time—are you kidding? [pause] Wait, what do you mean I saved you? [confused] I didn't—I just, you know, I was just there when you needed someone to listen. [short pause] You're crying, oh honey, don't cry. [empathetically] Or wait, are these happy tears? [relieved] Okay good, because you're making me tear up too. [sniffle] You moved to Colorado? And started your own business? [extremely happy] Sarah, that's incredible! [laugh] You always talked about the mountains but I never thought you'd actually... wow. [pause] No, I'm not taking credit for any of this. [warm] You did all the hard work. I just, um, I just reminded you who you were before everything got so complicated. [getting emotional] Stop it, now you're really going to make me cry. [crying while speaking] I'm so proud of you. [pause] Yeah, of course I'll come visit. [laugh hysterically] Are you kidding? Free ski lessons from my newly adventurous best friend? [smiling speaking] I'm already looking at flights.
