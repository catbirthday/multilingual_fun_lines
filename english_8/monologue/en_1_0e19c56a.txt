=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] Look at him up there. My baby brother. Doctor Marcus Chen. [laugh] God, that sounds so official now. [warm] Eight years ago he was sleeping on my couch, studying until 4 AM with those ridiculous flashcards everywhere. And I was picking up extra shifts, telling myself it's fine, it's totally fine, we'll make it work. [pause] There were moments when I thought, um... when I wondered if we were crazy, you know? [quietly] Like when my car broke down and I had to choose between fixing it or his tuition payment. [laugh softly] I took the bus for three months. [emotional] But watching him now, in that cap and gown, shaking the dean's hand— [sniffle] Mom would've been so proud. [crying while speaking] She always said he had the hands of a healer. Even when he was little. [pause] And I got to help make it happen. Me. His big sister who, uh, who never even finished college. [extremely happy] But that's my brother up there. Doctor Chen. [laugh] And next week he starts his residency at Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins! [warm] Worth every penny. Every single penny.
