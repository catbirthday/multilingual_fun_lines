[bitter] I keep telling myself I should be happy for her, right? [pause] But I remember—God, I remember finding her in her room that night, just sobbing. [very quietly] The way she couldn't even say his name for months. [clearing throat] And now I'm supposed to, what, shake his hand at Sunday dinners? [frustrated] Welcome him to the family? \n\n[slowly] The thing is, I can see she's happy now. Like, genuinely happy. [hesitantly] And maybe people change, I mean... maybe he's different. [mumbling] Or maybe she's different. I don't know. \n\n[angry] But part of me wants to pull him aside and just— [pause] No. [exhausted] I can't. That's not my place anymore, is it? She's an adult, she made her choice. [regretful] I just... hmm, I keep thinking about walking her down the aisle to someone who already proved he could break her. [very sad] \n\n[resigned] My wife says I need to let it go. That holding onto this will just, er... push our daughter away. [sigh] She's probably right. [very quietly] She usually is. [slowly] So I'll smile, I'll be polite, I'll... ugh, I'll probably even give a toast. [bitter] But I'm watching him. [stern] Always watching."
