[excited] Wait wait wait, if I run this query with the income parameters and— [gasp softly] Oh. Oh wow. There are, um... there are forty-seven families in our database who qualify for expanded coverage. [very quietly] Forty-seven. \n\n[shaky voice] The Martinez family, they've been paying out of pocket for their daughter's insulin because they thought they made too much. But with the new guidelines, they're actually... they're eligible. [pause] And Mrs. Chen, she's been, hmm, she's been skipping her blood pressure meds every other day to make them last. [empathetically] She qualifies for the prescription assistance program. She qualifies for all of it.\n\n[speaking fast] I can generate these reports now, I can actually— I can flag everyone who's eligible but hasn't applied. [warm] All those hours of tutorials and practice scenarios, and now I can finally, you know, actually help these people. [passionate] They don't even know! They're just out there struggling, rationing medicine, avoiding doctors, and they qualify for help that's just... sitting there. [very sincerely] Tomorrow I'm calling every single one of them."
