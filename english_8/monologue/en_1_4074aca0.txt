Subject: Your cart attendant job covering your tuition but watching wealthy customers treat you invisibly

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Eight hours today. Eight hours of pushing carts in the rain while this woman literally stepped around me like I was, I don't know, part of the pavement. [bitter] Didn't even look up from her phone when I said "excuse me." Just kept walking. [sigh] And the thing is, right, I get it—everyone's busy, everyone's got their own stuff, but... hmm, it's like I'm not even human to them sometimes. This guy today, he watched me struggling with these carts that got all jammed up, and he just stood there. Waiting. [frustrated] Like I'm some kind of cart-retrieving robot or something. 

Then his kid drops trash right next to the cart return—right next to it!—and they both just walk away. [pause] I mean, that's my tuition on the ground, you know? Every piece of garbage, every cart in the rain, that's another page of my textbook, another lecture I can actually afford to attend. [slowly] Sometimes I want to tell them. Like, "Hey, I'm pre-med. I'm going to be saving lives someday." But then I think, why should I have to justify my existence to them? [exhausted] Why should I have to prove I'm worth basic courtesy?

[quietly] Two more semesters. That's all. Two more semesters of being invisible, and then... then I'll be the one they actually see.
