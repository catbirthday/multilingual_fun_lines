Subject: Your oyster harvesting lease getting revoked because of pollution you had nothing to do with but can't afford to fight legally

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Three generations. Three generations of my family worked these beds, and now they're telling me it's over because of some chemical plant twenty miles upriver. [bitter] Twenty miles. That's not even my county. [pause] The letter came yesterday—"immediate cessation of all harvesting activities." Like that. Like I'm the one who poisoned the water. [angry] Do you know how many tests I've paid for out of my own pocket? How many times I've proved my oysters are clean? [sigh] Doesn't matter. The whole bay's designated now. Contaminated zone. [very sad] I keep thinking about my grandfather, how he taught me to read the tides, to know when the shells were ready just by the sound they made underwater. All that knowledge, it's just... what's it for now? [frustrated] The lawyer wants eight thousand just to file the appeal. Eight thousand I don't have because I haven't been able to harvest for two months already. [quietly] Thirty-seven years I've been doing this. It's not just my job, it's—it's who I am. [pause] [exhausted] And the company that actually did this? They'll pay some fine, probably. Cost of doing business. While I lose everything.
