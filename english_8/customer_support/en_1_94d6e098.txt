=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look. Card declined. Third time. Not your fault but...

Customer Support: Oh! Oh okay—let me—actually wait I see what's happening here your account AC-9847-VX2 has a fraud hold that's triggering at exactly $150.00 which is probably why it keeps—yeah there it is!

Customer: Fraud hold? I shop there. Every week.

Customer Support: Right right so—um—here's the thing the system flagged three attempts at exactly $150.00 from IP address 74.203.18.92 and it thinks—no wait actually—it thinks someone's testing your card.

Customer: Testing. My card. At the grocery store I...

Customer Support: I know I know it's—*exhales*—stupid honestly but I can fix this right now just need to verify your billing zip is still 48226 and then boom fraud department releases it.

Customer: Still 48226. How long. Need groceries. Today.

Customer Support: Okay okay so I'm—let me just—submitting the override now case number CSE-4492-MNK and it'll be active in, um, approximately 4 to 7 minutes max.

Customer: Four to seven. You sure? Because last time...

Customer Support: Oh absolutely—actually no wait even better—I just got the confirmation code CNF-8823-PP which means it's already processing so maybe like 2 minutes tops.

Customer: Two minutes. Okay. Should I just... wait here or...

Customer Support: Actually you know what—er—refresh your app in exactly 90 seconds and you'll see the hold removed and your available balance should show $1,847.32 again.

Customer: How do you know my exact... Never mind. Fine.

Customer Support: I'm just—I'm really good at this—um—sorry that sounded weird but I mean I've released probably 200 fraud holds this week alone so I know exactly how long each status code takes.

Customer: Two hundred? This week? That's...

Customer Support: Yeah it's—*sharp inhale*—honestly we had a breach at vendor VND-7734 last month affected about 11,000 cards so we're being super careful but catching some false positives.

Customer: Breach. Great. Should I be... worried or...

Customer Support: Oh! No no no—actually wait—your card ending in 4429 wasn't in that batch but, um, if you want I can overnight you a replacement arrives tomorrow by 10:30am just for peace of mind?

Customer: Tomorrow. Ten thirty. Sure. Why not...

Customer Support: Perfect perfect expedited order EXP-9901-LK2 is placed and just—er—sorry about all this truly the system's just trying to protect you but I know it's annoying when you're just trying to buy groceries!
