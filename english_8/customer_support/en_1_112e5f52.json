Can I ask though—and totally no pressure—but is there anything specific that made you want to leave? Sometimes there's stuff I can fix that people don't even know we can adjust."

But just so you know, er, looking at your usage pattern USG-7749-K, you've barely touched any of the premium features you're paying for. Would dropping you to the free tier maybe work better?"

The free tier launched, hmm, about three months ago—reference code TIER-FREE-2024—and it includes basically everything except the advanced analytics and priority support. You'd keep all your data, all your basic features, just no monthly charge."

Let me see here... yep, I can see the previous interaction ticket TKT-3928-B where they said they'd switch you but, ugh, it never got processed properly. Tell you what—I'm gonna do this while we're on the phone together and give you a confirmation email right now so you have proof."

And hey, I'm putting a note in your account—note ID NOTE-7749-SP—that says you've been through this before, so if anything weird happens with billing again, any rep who pulls this up will immediately see the full history and fix it. Is there anything else I can help with while I've got everything pulled up?"
