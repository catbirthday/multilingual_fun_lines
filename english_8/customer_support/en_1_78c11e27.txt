=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look, I need to fix something. You charged me twice in August—no wait, September. September.

Customer Support: Okay okay, I can definitely look into that billing issue for you, though I should mention that anything past 60 days can be... Let me pull up your account here, what's the name?

Customer: Patterson. And before you ask, yes I'm just now noticing. Been busy.

Customer Support: Got it, no judgment at all, these things happen more than you'd think actually, so I'm seeing here account number 4429-8851-PA and you mentioned September, which specific charges are we looking at?

Customer: The premium subscription. Eighty dollars. Twice. Same day even.

Customer Support: Right right, I see what you're referring to now, transaction IDs 88421-SEP and 88423-SEP both on September 14th for $79.99 each, and honestly I wish I had better news but our standard refund window is 60 days which would've ended November 13th...

Customer: So that's it? Just... I'm out eighty bucks because I didn't catch it fast enough?

Customer Support: Well, not necessarily, I'm looking at your history here and you've been with us since 2021, perfect payment record, never had an issue before, so what I can potentially do is escalate this to our retention team with case number RET-9981-24...

Customer: Wait, really? They can actually fix this?

Customer Support: I can't guarantee anything but between you and me, when I flag it with code E7 for loyal customer duplicate billing, they approve about 85% of these, especially since the system shows both charges originated from the same IP address within 3 minutes...

Customer: Three minutes. Of course. Probably my browser glitching or—doesn't matter. When would I hear back?

Customer Support: Typically 24 to 48 hours via email, they'll send the decision to the address on file which shows as p.patterson at gmail, and if approved the credit appears within 3 to 5 business days on your original payment method ending in 7234.

Customer: That's actually... wow, okay. I was expecting a whole fight about this.

Customer Support: Honestly we try to make it right when we can, and your account shows zero disputes, zero late payments, current lifetime value of $2,847 so yeah, this should be pretty straightforward for the team to approve.

Customer: The lifetime what now? Twenty-eight hundred? Jesus, that's—yeah okay that's a lot.

Customer Support: It adds up over three years doesn't it, but look, that's exactly why I'm optimistic about your case, reference number RET-9981-24, just keep that handy when you get the email...

Customer: Already wrote it down. This is... thanks. Really. Thought I was stuck with this.

Customer Support: No problem at all, these duplicate charges are frustrating and September feels recent even though it's December now, but we should get you sorted, anything else I can help with today?

Customer: Nope. Just that. And hey—actually doing something about it. Appreciate it.

Customer Support: Absolutely, happy to help, and you should see that email within 48 hours max, probably sooner since I'm submitting it now at 2:47 PM Eastern, have a great rest of your day!
