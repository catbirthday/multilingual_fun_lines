Three attempted deliveries on November 18th, 20th, and 22nd, all marked as, er, \"customer unavailable\" which is probably not— I mean that doesn't sound accurate, does it?"

So what I think happened here is, uh... how do I explain this... sometimes our delivery partners have issues with certain zones— yours is zone R44— and they sort of default to that status even when, well, even when it's not true. Let me check something else real quick."

Hmm, so I can see your package weighs 3 pounds 7 ounces and it's currently back at our distribution center DC-881. What I'd like to do is, er... actually, hold on, let me check what options I have here."

Given the hassle you've been through, I could arguably do a full refund and still resend it. Would that, um, would that work for you?"

And this time I'm putting a special note, er, let me phrase this right... \"Multiple delivery failures - ensure successful delivery\" in our system."

Your tracking number for tomorrow's delivery is TRK-88429-QXL, and if there's any issue— though I really don't think there will be— just reference case number CS-20241128-4470 and we'll prioritize it immediately."
