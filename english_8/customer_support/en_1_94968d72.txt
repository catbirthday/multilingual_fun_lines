=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Let me see here... Card won't work. Hmm. Might've done something wrong.

Customer Support: Oh no worries at all, let's figure this out together! So I'm pulling up your account here—wait, sorry, need your member ID first—that's the MID number on your card, starts with MID-4 and then has like eight more digits after that.

Customer: Okay so... MID-4892-7736. Think I clicked something. Reset maybe?

Customer Support: Perfect, got it! Okay so between you and me? Half the calls I get are about this exact thing, and honestly—no wait, let me check something first—yep, I can see your password reset attempt from yesterday at 3:47 PM, and it looks like the system, er, didn't complete the verification step.

Customer: Knew it. My fault then. What now?

Customer Support: Actually no, not your fault at all! See, the verification email went to your old address ending in @hotmail—sorry, I mean, it should've gone to your gmail but the system still had your old one on file, so really that's on us.

Customer: Hmm, wait... How do I know this isn't... Never gave you my email.

Customer Support: Oh totally fair question! So I can see here your primary email on account ACC-7829-QM is the gmail one you updated in January, but for some reason the security settings—er, let me rephrase that—the password recovery still points to the hotmail from 2019.

Customer: Okay so that means... Still locked out though. Just need in.

Customer Support: Right right, absolutely.

Customer: Let me think... Is there a fee? For fixing whatever I broke?

Customer Support: Oh gosh no, absolutely not! Listen, I'm gonna let you in on something here—this happens literally dozens of times a day, and between you and me? It's a known glitch we haven't fixed yet, so what I'm gonna do is send you a priority reset link to SMS-7736, that's the number on file, and waive any verification holds.

Customer: That's... suspicious. How much info can you see exactly?

Customer Support: Mm, so I can see your last four transactions, your shipping address which is, uh, lemme check—1847 Pine Street, Unit B—and basically just what I need to verify identity and help with account stuff, nothing like, you know, nothing invasive or anything.

Customer: Hmm. Fine. Send it then. Hope this works.

Customer Support: Already sent! Should hit your phone in about, er, fifteen seconds—no wait, there it is, just went through at 2:47:32 PM, and once you click that link you'll get a temporary password that starts with TEMP- and then some random characters.

Customer: Got it. TEMP-QX9M-2K7L. Now what?

Customer Support: Perfect!

Customer: Still not working. Let me see... Oh. Caps lock. Never mind.

Customer Support: Happens to the best of us, seriously! Actually, while I have you—since this whole thing was basically our system being weird—I'm adding a courtesy credit of $15 to your account, reference number CRD-2024-8837-B, just as a sorry for the hassle, and I've updated your recovery email so this won't happen again.
