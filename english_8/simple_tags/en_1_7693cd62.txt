Scenario: A bailiff arrives to evict a meteorologist from their weather research station just as a Category 5 hurricane approaches the coast.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Dr. Chen, I really wish I wasn't standing here right now with this eviction notice, especially with what's showing on all those weather monitors behind you. [pause] But the court order is dated and I have to execute it today.

Character 2: [bitter] You're seriously going to shut down the only independent weather station monitoring this coastline while a Category 5 hurricane barrels toward us? [exhales] The bank couldn't wait three more days until after the storm passes?

Character 1: [quietly] Look, I've been doing this job for twelve years and I've never had to evict someone from a weather station before. [sighs] The radar equipment alone must be worth hundreds of thousands, and you're telling me lives depend on it staying operational right now.

Character 2: [desperately] That hurricane just jumped from Category 3 to 5 in six hours—that's almost unheard of rapid intensification. [shaky voice] Without my station's data, the National Weather Service is flying blind for this entire coastal region, and people won't get accurate evacuation warnings.

Character 1: [anxious] Jesus, my daughter lives in Rockport, right in the projected path you're showing there. [pause] How accurate is that model, and when exactly is this thing supposed to make landfall?

Character 2: Thirty-six hours. [very quietly] Maybe less.

Character 1: [frustrated] The paperwork says I need to secure the premises and change the locks immediately, but there's got to be some provision for public safety emergencies. [exhales] Can you show me exactly what happens if this station goes dark right now?

Character 2: See those gaps? [trembling] That's death.

Character 1: [slowly] I'm looking at wind speeds of 185 miles per hour on your projections, and storm surge estimates that would put half the county underwater. [very quietly] My supervisor is going to have my badge for this, but I can't be responsible for what happens if I shut you down now.

Character 2: [hopeless] It doesn't matter anyway because the backup generators only have eighteen hours of fuel left, and my credit cards are all maxed from trying to keep this place running. [sighs] Once the power goes out, all this equipment becomes useless metal and plastic.

Character 1: [empathetically] What if I officially executed the eviction but somehow forgot to actually change the locks until Monday? [pause] And maybe I accidentally leave my emergency generator from the van connected to your system when I drive away?

Character 2: [surprised] You'd risk your job for this? [quietly] They'll know you didn't follow protocol when they review the bodycam footage—you're wearing one right now, and I'm betting it's recording everything we're saying.

Character 1: [firmly] The camera malfunctioned about ten minutes ago, strangest thing really, these weather conditions must be interfering with the electronics. [clears throat] Happens more often than you'd think during severe atmospheric disturbances.

Character 2: [shaky voice] I've been running this station alone for three years since the university cut funding, selling my car, my mother's jewelry, everything to keep it operational. [exhales] Most people think I'm crazy for hanging on this long.

Character 1: [warmly] My grandfather was a storm chaser back in Oklahoma, used to say the weather doesn't care about banks or mortgages or court orders. [sighs] He'd never forgive me if I let bureaucracy get people killed.

Character 2: [perceptive] You keep checking your phone—your family's in the evacuation zone, aren't they? [very quietly] The storm's tracking more eastward than the mainstream models show, which means Rockport's going to get a direct hit instead of a glancing blow.

Character 1: [anxious] Then I need to get them out tonight, not tomorrow morning like we planned. [quickly] How certain are you about that eastward shift, and why aren't the TV meteorologists mentioning it?

Character 2: [exhausted] Because their data is six hours old and they're using atmospheric models that don't account for the unusual water temperatures we're seeing this year. [sighs] I've been trying to warn them but no one listens to the crazy lady in the condemned weather station anymore.

Character 1: [decisively] Well I'm listening now, and I'm going to make damn sure others do too. [pause] Write down everything you need to keep this place running for the next seventy-two hours—fuel, supplies, whatever—and I'll figure out how to get it here.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] You don't understand what this means—I thought I was going to have to watch this storm kill people while sitting helpless in some shelter. [shaky voice] Thank you for seeing past the eviction notice to what really matters here.
