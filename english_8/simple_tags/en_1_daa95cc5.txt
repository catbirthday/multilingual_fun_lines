Scenario: A tyrannical tech CEO is confronted by their HR manager who has compiled years of employee complaints and is offering one last chance at redemption before submitting a damning report to the board.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [irritated] What exactly is this about, Rebecca? [pause] I've got three board meetings today and, uh, frankly I don't have time for whatever HR bureaucracy you're trying to push on me right now.

Character 2: [calmly] This is about the seventeen formal complaints filed against you in the past six months, Marcus. [clears throat] I've been documenting everything—the screaming matches, the public humiliations, the, um, frankly illegal threats you've made to terminate people for taking sick days.

Character 1: Complaints? [laughs] Those are from weak performers who can't handle the pressure of excellence, obviously they're going to whine when someone actually holds them accountable.

Character 2: [firmly] Your senior engineer had a panic attack in the parking lot last week. [pause] She's been with us eight years, Marcus, and she's terrified to even check her email because of your, uh, let's call them 'motivational messages' at 3 AM demanding code reviews.

Character 1: [defensive] If people can't handle working at a company that's changing the world, then maybe they should, I don't know, go work at some mediocre startup where they can play ping pong all day. [sighs] This is what greatness requires, Rebecca.

Character 2: [sincerely] Greatness doesn't require destroying people, Marcus. [quietly] Look, I've worked here since day one, I believed in your vision, but somewhere along the way you, um, you started confusing fear with respect.

Character 1: [angrily] Fear gets results! [loudly] Every successful company in history was built by someone willing to be the bad guy, to push harder than anyone else thought was reasonable.

Character 2: [empathetically] You weren't always like this though. [sighs] Remember when we had twelve people in that garage, and you knew everyone's kids' names? You bought Tom's daughter that violin when she got into Juilliard, you actually cared about these people as, well, as people.

Character 1: [bitter] That was before we had shareholders breathing down my neck, before every quarter had to show thirty percent growth or the board starts talking about 'leadership changes.' [pause] Caring is a luxury I can't afford anymore.

Character 2: [confidently] The board's already talking about leadership changes, Marcus. [hesitantly] They, uh, they asked me to compile a report on company culture, and I'm submitting it tomorrow with all seventeen complaints attached.

Character 1: [very quietly] You're betraying me.

Character 2: [warmly] No, I'm trying to save you from yourself. [pause] If you agree to executive coaching, anger management, and a formal apology to the staff, I can, um, I can frame this as a growth opportunity rather than gross misconduct.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, how generous of you, making me grovel to people I pay six figures to do their jobs. [exhales] You really think therapy and some corporate feel-good nonsense is going to fix anything?

Character 2: [seriously] I think it might help you remember why you started this company in the first place. [sighs] It wasn't just about the money or the power, Marcus—you wanted to build something that mattered, with people who mattered to you.

Character 1: Maybe those people never mattered as much as I pretended they did. [pause] Maybe I was always this person and just had better PR back then.

Character 2: [gently] I don't believe that, and honestly, I don't think you do either. [pause] The Marcus who hired me ten years ago said he wanted to create a company where brilliant people could do their best work without sacrificing their humanity.

Character 1: [shaky voice] That Marcus was naive, Rebecca. [quietly] He didn't understand that humanity is what you sacrifice first when you're trying to win, that compassion is just another word for weakness in this industry.

Character 2: [passionately] Then why are you crying right now? [pause] If you really believed that, if you were really this heartless tyrant you're trying so hard to be, you wouldn't have tears in your eyes talking about who you used to be.

Character 1: [broken] Because I can't remember how to be him anymore. [long pause] I've been playing this role so long that I, uh, I actually forgot it was supposed to be an act.

Character 2: [reassuringly] Then let me help you remember. [warmly] Take the coaching, Marcus, apologize to your team, and let's try to rebuild this company into something we can both be proud of again—it's not too late to change course.
