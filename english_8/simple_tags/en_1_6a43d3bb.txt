Scenario: An apheresis nurse recognizes their estranged sibling, now a successful sommelier, as the next blood platelet donor in their treatment room.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [very quietly] Marcus? [pause] I saw your name on the donor list this morning but I thought it had to be a different Marcus Chen, because what are the odds you'd be here after all these years?

Character 2: Hello, Lily. [clearing throat] The receptionist said my nurse would be someone named L. Chen, but I never imagined it would actually be you working here.

Character 1: [hesitantly] You're donating platelets for a pediatric cancer patient, according to your intake form. [softly] That's incredibly generous of you, especially since most people don't even know what apheresis is.

Character 2: [warmly] It's the right thing.

Character 1: [gently] Well, we should probably get started with the screening questions, though I already know most of your medical history from when we were kids. [pause] Have you had any recent illnesses or taken any medications in the past two weeks?

Character 2: [quietly] Nothing recent, no.

Character 1: [professionally] Your arm looks good for the needle placement, strong veins just like Dad's. [softly] The process takes about two hours, and you'll be hooked up to this machine that separates your platelets from the rest of your blood.

Character 2: [curious] Does it hurt more than regular blood donation? I've been donating whole blood for years but this is my first time doing platelets.

Character 1: [reassuringly] It's actually quite comfortable once we get started, just a small pinch for the needle. [warmly] Most donors watch movies or read, but the machine makes this rhythmic clicking sound that some people find soothing. [chuckles]

Character 2: [smiling speaking] Speaking of rhythmic processes, I spend my days now teaching people about wine fermentation and aging, which has its own meditative quality.

Character 1: Mom mentioned you became a sommelier.

Character 2: You still talk to Mom? [surprised] She told me you hadn't spoken to anyone in the family for three years after the fight about Dad's treatment. [pause]

Character 1: [regretful] We reconnected last Christmas when she had that health scare. [very quietly] I realized I'd been punishing everyone for my own guilt about not being able to save him, even though I wasn't even a nurse yet.

Character 2: [empathetically] You were nineteen, Lily, and watching your father die of leukemia while studying to become a nurse must have been excruciating.

Character 1: [shaky voice] That's actually why I specialized in apheresis, you know, because platelet donations literally save leukemia patients like Dad could have been saved if we'd had more donors back then.

Character 2: [softly] Is that why you're emotional about my donation today? [gently] Because the recipient is a child with leukemia, and it's bringing everything back?

Character 1: [crying while speaking] The little girl you're helping is seven years old, same age you were when Dad first got sick. [sniffle] Her name is Emma and she loves dinosaurs. [pause]

Character 2: [warmly] Then I'll come back every two weeks for as long as she needs platelets. [very sincerely] Maybe we could grab coffee after one of the sessions, catch up properly?

Character 1: [relieved] I'd really like that, Marcus, and there's this wine bar near the hospital that just opened if you want to tell me about your sommelier journey sometime.

Character 2: Only if you promise to explain how this amazing machine works, because watching my blood go out and come back while it keeps the platelets is absolutely fascinating. [chuckles]
