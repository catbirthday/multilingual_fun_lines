            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[firmly] The facility was compromised three weeks ago, but not by foreign agents like they're claiming. [quieter] Our own people orchestrated the breach to cover up what they've been developing in the sub-basement labs, something that violates every treaty we've signed."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[bitter] Morrison's been running this operation since before you were recruited. [exhales] The man who pinned your badge on you at graduation has been weaponizing cognitive enhancement drugs on unwilling test subjects, mostly prisoners nobody would miss."
