=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Maya? Is that really you standing in my shop after twenty years? [quietly] I thought you were still somewhere in Syria or Afghanistan, chasing stories.

Character 2: [warmly] The chocolate smell hit me two blocks away and I knew you'd kept the place. [pause] Same copper pots in the window, same handwritten menu board.

Character 1: [hesitantly] You look different, thinner, and there's something in your eyes that wasn't there when you left. [concerned] Are you okay? Really okay, I mean.

Character 2: [quietly] I came back because I needed to see home one more time, needed to taste your salted caramels and pretend we're still twenty-five with our whole lives ahead.

Character 1: [very quietly] That's not an answer, Maya. [sighs] You always did deflect with poetry when things got too real.

Character 2: [bitter] Six months, maybe eight.

Character 1: [shaky voice] What do you mean six months? [gasps softly] Maya, what are you talking about?

Character 2: [calmly] The doctors found it everywhere when I got back from Aleppo last month. [exhales] Lungs, liver, bones. Twenty years of war zones and it's my own cells that declared war.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] You can't just walk in here after two decades and tell me you're dying. [voice breaking] That's not how this was supposed to go.

Character 2: [gently] I know, but I needed to come home, needed to sit in this shop and watch you work like we used to dream about when we were kids. Remember?

Character 1: [regretful] I saved your favorite stool at the counter all these years, the one by the window where you'd write while I practiced new recipes.

Character 2: [smiling speaking] You kept it? [laughs softly] Even after I left without saying goodbye, just that stupid note about needing to see the world?

Character 1: [firmly] Of course I kept it. [pause] I kept everything, including that ridiculous journal you left behind with all your plans to change the world through journalism.

Character 2: [melancholic] Did I change anything? [sighs] Thousands of stories filed from dozens of countries, and the wars just kept coming, the suffering never stopped.

Character 1: [empathetically] You told their stories, Maya, you made sure the world couldn't look away. That matters more than you know.

Character 2: [very quietly] I'm scared, Sam.

Character 1: [warmly] Then stay here with me for whatever time you have. [determined] We'll make chocolates and you'll write and we'll pretend we're kids again every single day.

Character 2: [tearfully] I was hoping you'd say that but didn't want to ask, didn't want to burden you after disappearing for so long. [pause] Do you really mean it?

Character 1: You were never a burden, not then and not now, and yes, I mean every word. [softly] Welcome home, Maya.

Character 2: [relieved] Thank you for not hating me for leaving, for understanding why I had to go even though it meant leaving everything we'd planned behind. [crying while speaking] Thank you.
