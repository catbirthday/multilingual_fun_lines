=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Oh my God, David?

Character 2: [defensive] Don't.

Character 3: [hesitantly] What are you doing here? I mean, Jesus, you're sleeping in our parking garage? How long have you, uh, been down here?

Character 2: [bitter] Does it matter? Look, I'll leave, alright? Just, um, give me a minute to grab my stuff and you can pretend you never saw me.

Character 1: [frustrated] No, wait, that's not—[sighs] David, when did you get out? Mom said the rehab program was ninety days, and that was only, what, two months ago?

Character 2: Left after three weeks. The whole thing was, I don't know, pointless. [quietly] They wanted me to talk about feelings and childhood trauma and all that crap when really I just needed to get clean.

Character 1: [firmly] You look terrible.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Yeah well, not everyone can afford thousand-dollar suits and, uh, whatever that watch costs. [laughs bitterly] Some of us actually have to live in the real world, not in some glass tower managing other people's retirements.

Character 1: [angrily] Oh, please. Don't give me that class warfare bullshit, David. We grew up in the same house, went to the same schools. The only difference is I didn't, um, throw everything away for—

Character 2: [shouting] For what? Go ahead, say it! For drugs, for being weak, for being the family disappointment? [shaky voice] You think I don't know what everyone thinks of me?

Character 1: [quietly] That's not what I was going to say. Look, I manage forty billion in pension assets, ensuring thousands of people don't end up homeless in retirement, and here's my own brother literally sleeping on concrete because he won't accept help.

Character 2: [exhausted] Your help always comes with strings, Michael. It's never just help, it's, uh, lectures and conditions and making me feel like even more of a failure than I already do.

Character 1: [empathetically] When did you last eat something? I mean, an actual meal, not whatever you've been surviving on.

Character 2: Yesterday morning, I think. Maybe the day before. Time gets, um, weird when you're not really sleeping, just kind of existing between being high and being sick.

Character 1: [very quietly] Are you using right now? And please, just be honest with me for once.

Character 2: [pause] Not since Thursday. Ran out of money, ran out of, uh, options. [trembling] That's why I came here, actually. Remembered you mentioning the garage had security cameras turned off at night for some insurance thing.

Character 1: [sadly] You came here hoping I'd find you, didn't you? This wasn't random. [sighs] You knew I always work late on Mondays reviewing the Asian markets.

Character 2: Maybe. I don't know. [very quietly] I'm tired, Michael. Not just, like, physically tired but tired of running, tired of lying, tired of waking up wondering if today's the day I finally OD and honestly not caring either way.

Character 1: [warmly] Come upstairs. My office has a shower in the executive bathroom, and I've got a change of clothes from my gym bag. We'll get you cleaned up, get some food in you, and, um, figure out what comes next. No lectures, I promise.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I don't deserve this. After everything I've done, the money I stole from Mom, the things I said to you last Christmas. [sniffles] Why would you even want to help me?
