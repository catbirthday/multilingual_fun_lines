[shaky voice] Without my station's data, the National Weather Service is flying blind for this entire coastal region, and people won't get accurate evacuation warnings."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[perceptive] You keep checking your phone—your family's in the evacuation zone, aren't they? [very quietly] The storm's tracking more eastward than the mainstream models show, which means Rockport's going to get a direct hit instead of a glancing blow."
