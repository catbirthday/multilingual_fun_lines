=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [urgently] Listen carefully, we have maybe ten minutes before they trace this location through the security cameras. [speaking fast] Everything I taught you about pattern recognition, everything about reading micro-expressions and detecting surveillance, you're going to need it all starting tonight.

Character 2: [anxiously] You said this was just a training exercise when you called, but you're bleeding through your jacket and your hands are shaking. [voice breaking] What happened at the facility, and why are they calling you a traitor on every encrypted channel?

Character 1: [firmly] The facility was compromised three weeks ago, but not by foreign agents like they're claiming. [quieter] Our own people orchestrated the breach to cover up what they've been developing in the sub-basement labs, something that violates every treaty we've signed.

Character 2: [confused] That doesn't make sense, Director Morrison signed off on all the lab protocols himself, and he's been with the agency for thirty years. [hesitantly] Are you saying he's part of whatever this conspiracy is?

Character 1: [bitter] Morrison's been running this operation since before you were recruited. [exhales] The man who pinned your badge on you at graduation has been weaponizing cognitive enhancement drugs on unwilling test subjects, mostly prisoners nobody would miss.

Character 2: [whispering] No.

Character 1: [speaking fast] I have proof on this drive, medical records, video surveillance, financial transactions linking Morrison to black site facilities in four countries. [pause] But I need you to be the one who exposes it because they'll kill me before I can testify.

Character 2: [shaky voice] You're asking me to destroy my entire career, to betray everyone I've worked with for the past five years. [frustrated] Even if what you're saying is true, they'll come after me the moment I access those files.

Character 1: [warmly] You're the only one I trained who never lost their moral compass, even when following orders would have been easier. [proudly] That stubborn integrity of yours that used to drive me crazy during training scenarios, that's exactly why I'm trusting you with this.

Character 2: [very quietly] How long have you known about this? [accusingly] How many operations did we run together while you were sitting on information about our own agency torturing people?

Character 1: [regretful] Six months, and every day since I discovered the truth has been a calculation of when to act and who to trust. [sighs] I kept you in the dark to protect you, but now protection means giving you the power to fight back.

Character 2: [desperately] There has to be another way, someone higher up we can report to, maybe the oversight committee or even the press directly. [speaking fast] We could leak it anonymously, keep both our names out of it completely.

Character 1: The oversight committee members are getting kickbacks from the pharmaceutical contracts, and the two journalists who started investigating mysteriously died in separate car accidents last month. [firmly] This has to be done from the inside, with someone they won't immediately suspect.

Character 2: [resigned] You've already decided you're not coming back from this, haven't you? [voice breaking] This meeting isn't about passing on information, it's you saying goodbye while pretending everything might work out fine.

Character 1: [gently] I've got three passports, enough cash to last a decade, and a boat waiting at the marina that officially sank two days ago. [chuckles] Remember when you asked why I made you learn sailing during desert warfare training?

Character 2: [crying while speaking] You paranoid bastard, you've been planning an exit strategy this entire time. [laughs] All those crazy survival scenarios you put me through, the dead drops, the emergency protocols, you were preparing me to lose you.

Character 1: [very sincerely] Every mentor's job is to make themselves obsolete eventually, to train someone better than they ever were. [proudly] You're faster, smarter, and most importantly, you still believe this job can mean something good.

Character 2: [determined] Fine, I'll take the drive, I'll find a way to expose Morrison and whoever else is involved. [firmly] But you have to promise me something in return, that you'll send proof of life every six months, even if it's just a blank postcard from nowhere.

Character 1: [warmly] Look for postcards with birds on them, different species each time, and know that your old mentor is somewhere watching the sunrise over water. [pause] They're coming up the stairs now, so you need to go out the back while I buy you time.

Character 2: [quickly] Thank you for choosing me, for seeing something worth saving in a rookie who couldn't even properly clear a room. [emotionally] I won't let you down, I promise you that, and when this is over, when it's safe, I'll find you wherever you're hiding.
