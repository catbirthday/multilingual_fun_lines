Character 1: So you're the contractor handling the reenactment supplies?

Character 2: [crying while speaking] Yes, that's me. I've been coordinating authentic reproductions for over fifteen years now. We're looking at 1,200 uniforms, 800 muskets, and about 400 tents for this July event.

Character 1: That's a massive order. What's the timeline?

Character 2: We need everything delivered by June 15th, which gives us exactly 87 days from today. The Union uniforms alone require 3,600 yards of wool fabric, and finding that quality in bulk is challenging these days.

Character 1: [slowly] How accurate are we talking here?

Character 2: Down to the button count. Each Confederate jacket needs exactly 9 brass buttons, Union coats need 12. We're using 1860s patterns exclusively, measuring thread counts to match museum pieces.

Character 1: [bored] And the weapons?

Character 2: Non-firing replicas, of course, but weighted identically to originals. Each 1861 Springfield musket replica weighs exactly 9.5 pounds, costs us $340 per unit. We're bringing in 450 for the Union side, 350 for Confederate forces.

Character 1: What about the artillery pieces?

Character 2: [playful] Now those are my favorite! We've got 12 full-scale cannon replicas coming in, each one weighing 1,200 pounds. They'll fire blanks that'll shake the ground from 500 feet away.

Character 1: How many people are we expecting?

Character 2: Registration shows 2,400 reenactors so far, plus we're anticipating 15,000 spectators over the weekend. That's why we're ordering 18,000 bottles of water and setting up 45 portable facilities.

Character 1: What's the total budget looking like?

Character 2: We're at $485,000 currently. The biggest chunk is transportation—moving all this historically accurate equipment costs nearly $80,000 alone. But every penny goes toward authenticity.

Character 1: Do you have enough horses lined up?

Character 2: [slowly] 75 horses confirmed, all trained for loud noises and crowds. Each cavalry unit needs 12 to 15 mounts, and we're covering 5 units total. Feed alone runs us $200 per horse for the weekend.

Character 1: What about medical supplies?

Character 2: Full medical tent with 6 EMTs on rotation, 500 bandages, 200 ice packs. We learned from Gettysburg 2019 when 47 people got heat exhaustion—this year we're doubling our shade structures.

Character 1: [laugh hard] Sounds like you've thought of everything!

Character 2: [cry loudly] After 15 years, you learn what works! We're recreating history for 20,000 people—every number matters. From the 3-pound cartridge boxes to the 16-ounce canteens, it all adds up to something special.
