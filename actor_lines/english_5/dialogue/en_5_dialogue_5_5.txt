=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I might have mentioned something about that project, or maybe I didn't. Hard to say.

Character 2: You definitely mentioned it. You said you were handling the budget review last Tuesday, remember? I need to know where we stand before the meeting tomorrow.

Character 1: Well, things change. You know how it is.

Character 2: No, I don't know how it is. The deadline hasn't changed, the requirements haven't changed. What specifically are you avoiding telling me here?

Character 1: Who says I'm avoiding anything? That's a pretty strong accusation.

Character 2: It's not an accusation, it's an observation. You've deflected three direct questions now. Look, if there's a problem with the numbers, we need to address it today.

Character 1: The numbers are... complicated.

Character 2: [happy] Complicated is my specialty! Seriously, that's why they brought me onto this team. Walk me through what's making them complex and we'll figure it out together.

Character 1: It's not really about complexity, per se.

Character 2: Then what's it about? Because you're dancing around something here and we're burning daylight. The board expects our presentation at nine tomorrow morning.

Character 1: Maybe we should loop in Sarah first. Get her perspective.

Character 2: Sarah's in Tokyo until Thursday. You know this because you approved her travel request. Stop stalling and tell me what's actually going on with the project.

Character 1: I wouldn't call it stalling. More like... strategic consideration.

Character 2: Strategic consideration is what you do before making decisions, not after missing deadlines. Did you even start the budget review or not?

Character 1: Define "start."

Character 2: Open the spreadsheet, input the quarterly figures, run the variance analysis. That's the start. It's literally the first three items on the checklist you created yourself.

Character 1: Checklists can be somewhat flexible, don't you think?

Character 2: Not when they're attached to regulatory compliance requirements, no. We need those numbers verified and submitted. This isn't optional or interpretive.

Character 1: Perhaps we could request an extension. Explore our options.

Character 2: The extension window closed last Friday. You signed off on the timeline six weeks ago. I'm pulling the files now and we're doing this together, tonight.
