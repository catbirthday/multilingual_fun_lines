=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I was reading about how dark matter makes up like 85% of the universe but we can't see it.

Character 2: Oh wait, that's—that's actually terrifying when you think about it, right? Like, we're basically blind to most of existence? How do we even, um, know it's there if we can't detect it directly?

Character 1: Gravitational effects. Galaxies rotate too fast to hold together without extra mass.

Character 2: [long pause] Huh. So we're inferring this whole massive thing from, what, wobbles? That's like... I mean, imagine discovering an entire invisible continent just from watching ocean currents behave weirdly, you know?

Character 1: Pretty much, yeah. Plus gravitational lensing shows mass where we see nothing.

Character 2: Okay but here's what I don't get—if it's everywhere, why can't we just, like, reach out and touch it? Is it passing through us right now? Through my coffee? Am I basically swimming in dark matter as we speak?

Character 1: [deep pitch] Millions of dark matter particles pass through you every second.

Character 2: [groan] God, that's... eerily poetic and disturbing at the same time. So we're basically ghosts to dark matter and it's a ghost to us? What if, um, what if there's like entire dark matter civilizations we'll never know about?

Character 1: That's not really how physics works.

Character 2: [bitter] Yeah but physics also said heavier-than-air flight was impossible once, didn't it? I'm just saying, we're admitting 85% of everything is completely mysterious to us—doesn't that kind of, uh, humble our assumptions a little?

Character 1: Dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically. No chemistry means no biology.

Character 2: [delighted] Oh! Oh wait, but what about those experiments in abandoned mines? The ones where they're trying to catch dark matter particles? That's so beautifully desperate, like building a net for invisible fish, hoping maybe one will accidentally bump into it!

Character 1: XENON, LUX, those experiments? They use liquid xenon detectors.

Character 2: [warm] See, that's what I love about physicists—you guys are essentially hunting phantoms with, what, swimming pools of exotic liquids underground? It's both incredibly precise and wonderfully absurd. Do you think we'll actually catch one in our lifetimes?

Character 1: Depends if WIMPs exist or if it's something else entirely.

Character 2: WIMPs! Right, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles—even the name sounds, I don't know, kind of sad? Like they're the introverts of the particle world, just floating through, avoiding everything.

Character 1: [curious] You know there are other candidates, right? Axions, sterile neutrinos, primordial black holes?

Character 2: Mmm, primordial black holes, now that's terrifying. So you're telling me dark matter could be, um, tiny ancient black holes just... everywhere? How do we sleep at night knowing we might be surrounded by microscopic reality-holes?

Character 1: They'd be smaller than atoms if they exist. Completely harmless at that scale.

Character 2: [high-pitched] But that's even weirder! Subatomic black holes as the scaffolding of the universe? It's like finding out your house is held up by, uh, invisible quantum termites that are somehow beneficial—I mean, how did reality get this strange?
