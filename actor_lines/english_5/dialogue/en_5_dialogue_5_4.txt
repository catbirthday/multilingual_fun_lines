=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [laugh histerically] You seriously think I'm going to apologize after what you did?

Character 2: Uh, no, I don't expect anything from you anymore. You've made it pretty clear where we stand, and honestly, I'm done pretending this is, like, salvageable or whatever.

Character 1: So that's it? Just done?

Character 2: Yeah, that's it. I mean, what else is there to say? You screwed me over, I'm moving on, end of story—no dramatic speeches necessary.

Character 1: You're being really cold about this.

Character 2: Cold? Hmm, okay, sure, if that's what you want to call it. I prefer to think of it as, uh, practical—wasting energy on dead relationships isn't really my thing anymore.

Character 1: We were together for three years.

Character 2: Right, and? Three years of, frankly, me giving way more than I got back. The math doesn't work out in your favor here, so spare me the nostalgia trip.

Character 1: [mumbling] I thought you'd at least want to talk it through.

Character 2: [cough] Talk through what exactly? How you lied about the promotion, or how you threw me under the bus with Sarah? Gosh, those conversations sound super productive.

Character 1: [very loudly] I was trying to protect you!

Character 2: Protect me. That's rich. You were protecting yourself and we both know it, so let's just, uhh, skip the revisionist history, yeah?

Character 1: You never even gave me a chance to explain.

Character 2: Mmm, because I don't need explanations for things I saw with my own eyes. The email thread was pretty self-explanatory, wouldn't you say?

Character 1: Those emails were taken out of context.

Character 2: Context. Right. See, the thing about context is it doesn't really change "I don't think she's ready for this" into something supportive, does it?

Character 1: [deep pitch] Fine. Be bitter. See where that gets you.

Character 2: Oh, I'm not bitter, I'm just... done. There's a difference, you know? Bitter implies I still care enough to be angry.

Character 1: So you don't care at all?

Character 2: Honestly? Not really, no. I've got actual problems to deal with now, and rehashing your, uh, inadequacies isn't on my priority list anymore—sorry if that stings.
