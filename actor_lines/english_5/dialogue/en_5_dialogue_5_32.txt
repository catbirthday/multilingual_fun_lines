=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Why are you even here? This is a triathlon, not a film set.

Character 2: I'm studying athletic movement patterns for my next project! The way triathletes transition between swimming, biking, and running is absolutely perfect reference material for the superhero sequences we're animating next month.

Character 1: Whatever. The swim portion starts in ten minutes.

Character 2: Ten minutes?! I haven't finished calibrating my portable motion sensors yet! Look, I need to capture the shoulder rotation during freestyle stroke, it's completely different from what we modeled in the studio.

Character 1: [furious] You're blocking the entrance to the changing area. Move.

Character 2: Sorry sorry sorry! I just need thirty more seconds to set up this marker system. Did you know that competitive swimmers generate almost two horsepower during their stroke? That's the kind of data that makes animations look real instead of floaty.

Character 1: I don't care about your animations.

Character 2: [curious] Wait, you're competing aren't you? What's your typical transition time between segments? I've been trying to understand how athletes mentally shift between completely different muscle groups and breathing patterns.

Character 1: About two minutes. Nothing special.

Character 2: Two minutes is incredibly fast! Most people take three to four minutes just to get their bearings. The neurological adaptation required to switch from horizontal swimming to vertical cycling is something we've been trying to replicate in our character rigs for months.

Character 1: Great. I'm going to warm up now.

Character 2: Can I film your warm-up routine? The pre-race movements are crucial for understanding how athletes prepare their bodies for multi-sport endurance events, plus it helps us animate realistic preparation sequences.

Character 1: [very sad] Do whatever you want. I probably won't even finish anyway.

Character 2: Don't say that! Every athlete I've studied has this moment of doubt right before competing. The biomechanics don't lie though—your posture and gait suggest you've been training consistently for at least six months.

Character 1: How would you even know that from just looking?

Character 2: [relieved] Oh thank god you asked! I analyze movement for a living—the way your shoulders sit, your hip alignment, the subtle muscle definition patterns all indicate serious training commitment, not casual participation.

Character 1: [laugh histerically] You think you can tell all that? That's completely ridiculous!

Character 2: I know it sounds crazy but I've motion-captured over three hundred athletes! After a while you start seeing patterns in how trained bodies move versus untrained ones, like how you unconsciously shifted your weight just now to conserve energy.

Character 1: Fine. Maybe you're right. The gun's about to go off.

Character 2: [shaky voice] This is it, this is actual race conditions! My reference library is going to be incredible—just remember to keep your elbows high during the swim portion, it reduces drag by almost fifteen percent according to our fluid dynamics simulations!
