            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Oh yeah, actually. It's, um, it's like that query language thing for APIs, right? Honestly reminds me a bit of how we handle cue sheets in theater—you only request what you need for each scene."

            "content": "[condescending] Well, think about it—in theater we don't, like, turn on every single light for every scene, we just pull the specific elements we need. GraphQL's basically doing that with data instead of, you know, spotlights."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Mmm, schemas are interesting. They're kind of like, err, blueprints? In set design we have these technical drawings that show every possible configuration, and then during the actual show we just use parts of them."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Oh man, nesting. So like, imagine you're designing a multi-level set piece, right? Each level has its own props and, uh, lighting needs, but they all connect to the main structure—that's basically what nested queries are doing."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "Never thought about it that way. Still feels overly complex sometimes."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[empathetically] Yeah, I totally get that frustration. When I started doing projection mapping for shows, all the layering felt, hmm, unnecessarily complicated too, but once it clicks, you realize you're getting exactly the control you need."

            "content": "Oh absolutely, it's, uh, it's like when we're loading in a show—instead of bringing the entire prop warehouse, we just bring what's on the preset list. Way more efficient, less wasted effort moving stuff you won't even use."

            "content": "Sure, REST is great for lots of things. It's like, um, traditional lighting boards versus modern programmable ones—both work, but one gives you more flexibility when you need to make quick adjustments mid-performance, you know?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",

            "content": "[gasp loudly] Oh jeez, yes! Once you get it, it's like discovering you can control individual LED pixels instead of whole light fixtures—the precision is, err, game-changing for complex data relationships."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Ha, well, modern theater tech is basically all software now. Our lighting boards, sound systems, projection mapping—it's all APIs and, like, data queries under the hood, so yeah, I picked it up for an interactive installation piece."
