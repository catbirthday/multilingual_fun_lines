=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [jealous] Your kid's already speaking three languages? Mine can barely handle English.

Character 2: It's not as impressive as it sounds, honestly. She just picks up whatever she hears around the house. My mom speaks Mandarin to her, I do English, and my partner does Spanish.

Character 1: Still though. That's incredible brain development happening right there.

Character 2: The research is pretty wild actually. Kids' brains are basically language sponges until about age seven. After that, the window starts closing and it gets exponentially harder to achieve native-level fluency.

Character 1: So I've already ruined my daughter's chances? She's eight.

Character 2: No no no, not ruined at all! She can absolutely still learn languages. It's just that the mechanism changes—adults use different parts of the brain for language learning than kids do.

Character 1: What do you mean different parts?

Character 2: [loudly] Oh this is so cool! Kids use their procedural memory system—same thing for riding a bike. Adults shift to declarative memory, which is more like memorizing facts. That's why kids don't need grammar rules; they just absorb patterns naturally.

Character 1: That explains why my high school French was such a disaster.

Character 2: Mine too. Four years of conjugation tables and I could barely order coffee in Paris. But immersion changes everything—your brain starts picking up patterns when it has to survive.

Character 1: Have you tried those language apps? Everyone swears by them.

Character 2: They're decent for vocabulary but terrible for actual communication. Real language acquisition needs social interaction, cultural context, emotional investment. Apps can't replicate the panic of trying to find a bathroom in Tokyo.

Character 1: Speaking of which, isn't Japanese supposed to be impossibly hard?

Character 2: For English speakers? Absolutely brutal. The Foreign Service Institute ranks it as Category 5—hardest possible. You're looking at 2,200 class hours minimum to reach proficiency.

Character 1: Twenty-two hundred hours? That's insane.

Character 2: That's just class time. Real fluency needs probably triple that in practice. Chinese and Arabic are in the same category—completely different writing systems, tonal variations, grammar that's nothing like English.

Character 1: Makes me feel better about struggling with Spanish verb tenses.

Character 2: Spanish is actually Category 1—easiest for English speakers. Should only take about 600 hours to get conversational. The grammar's pretty straightforward once you internalize the patterns.

Character 1: [whispering loudly] Don't tell my Spanish teacher I only put in like fifty hours total.

Character 2: Your secret's safe. But seriously, fifty hours of focused practice starting now would get you further than you think. Adult brains are actually better at conscious pattern recognition than kids' brains.
