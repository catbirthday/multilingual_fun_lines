=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um. Hi. Got a claim against me? I probably. Scratched something.

Customer Support: Oh yes yes yes I can definitely help with that let me pull that up for you real quick what's your—actually wait first name and company name so I can find the right file?

Customer: Jake. From Moving Pros. Let me see here... claim number is. Uh. 4829.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect got it right here claim CL-4829-JMP filed on November 3rd at 1847 Riverside Drive and oh! I see what happened here this is actually really interesting because the damage report shows minor scuff on hardwood but the photos they submitted are barely visible.

Customer: Yeah sounds about right. I'm an idiot. Didn't use floor pads.

Customer Support: No no no don't say that happens all the time actually but here's what I'm seeing the claim amount is $450 but looking at these photos I mean we're talking maybe refinishing like two square feet max at property ID PROP-8827-RD so I think we can definitely dispute this.

Customer: Just. Tell me what to pay. I'm too tired for this.

Customer Support: Wait wait hold on though because I'm going to—sorry let me just—no actually yes I'm going to escalate this to our dispute team at extension 2847 because honestly this feels excessive for what I'm seeing in the documentation.

Customer: Whatever. Fine. How long's that take?

Customer Support: Okay so dispute review takes 5 to 7 business days but listen I'm putting a priority flag on case CL-4829-JMP right now and I'm also adding notes that you've been cooperative throughout which really helps and the review team at 4400 Commerce Boulevard usually likes that.

Customer: Hmm. Okay so. They just decide if I pay or not?

Customer Support: Basically yes but—oh actually wait I just noticed something your insurance policy number INS-7792-MP shows you have coverage for minor damages under $500 did you know that was active?

Customer: I don't. Know. Maybe? Everything's a blur.

Customer Support: No I totally get it I really do but this is good news because even if the claim goes through your deductible is only $100 not the full amount so worst case you're looking at way less than you thought and I'm gonna make sure that's all documented properly.

Customer: Hundred bucks. Great. Still my fault though.

Customer Support: Look I see about 20 of these claims a week and honestly yours is nothing compared to what I usually—I mean some of these are legitimate disasters but this is just normal wear and tear that happens when you move a couch so don't beat yourself up.

Customer: Just checking boxes here. When do I know?

Customer Support: You'll get an email to your registered address by December 10th but also I'm setting up text alerts to your number ending in 3847 so you'll know immediately when the dispute team makes their decision and honestly I have a good feeling about this one.

Customer: Right. December 10th. Got it.

Customer Support: And hey one more thing I'm putting my direct extension 4429 in your file notes so if you need anything or if they try to charge you the full amount just call me directly and I'll sort it out because I'm not letting them overcharge you for two tiny scratches okay?
