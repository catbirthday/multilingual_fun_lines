=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I received my bill yesterday and my monthly rate increased from eighty-nine to one hundred twelve dollars with no notification.

Customer Support: I understand your concern about the unexpected increase. Let me pull up your account using your customer number, which should be CUS-892347-A on your bill, and I'll review what happened here.

Customer: That's correct. I've been a customer for three years and this is completely unexpected.

Customer Support: Thank you for your loyalty. I can see your account was moved from our Legacy Premium plan at $89.00 monthly to our current Premium Plus tier at $112.00 when the Legacy plans were discontinued October 1st.

Customer: Why wasn't I notified about this change in advance? This is a significant increase.

Customer Support: You're absolutely right to expect notification. According to your account records, we sent notices on August 15th and September 3rd to the email address ending in @techmail.com, but I see both emails show as undelivered.

Customer: That email hasn't been active for over a year. My current email should be in your system.

Customer Support: I see the issue now. Your primary contact email was updated in our billing system but not in our communications database, which is why the notices went to your old address at @techmail.com instead of your current one.

Customer: That's a serious oversight on your end. What can be done about this situation?

Customer Support: Of course.

Customer: I need more than acknowledgment. What are my options here?

Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration and I want to make this right. I can offer you a one-time courtesy credit of $69.00 to offset three months of the increase, plus I'll apply our retention discount code RET-2024-SAVE20 for twenty percent off your next six bills.

Customer: What about reverting to my original plan? I was satisfied with those features and price point.

Customer Support: Unfortunately, the Legacy Premium plans were permanently discontinued due to infrastructure changes, but our new Select tier at $95.00 monthly includes all your previous features plus 50GB additional storage and priority support.

Customer: So my only options are the credit you mentioned or downgrading to ninety-five dollars monthly?

Customer Support: Those are the primary options, yes. With the Select tier at $95.00 and the retention discount applied, your rate would actually be $76.00 monthly for the next six months, which is below your original $89.00 rate.

Customer: I suppose that's reasonable. Can you also ensure my contact information is properly updated across all systems?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm updating your email across all our systems right now and I've added a note to your account about this communication issue. You'll receive confirmation at your correct email within the next 10 minutes with reference number TKT-4521198-B.

Customer: Good. Please apply the Select tier with the retention discount and send me written confirmation of everything we discussed.

Customer Support: I've made those changes effective immediately. Your new monthly rate is $76.00 for six months, then $95.00 ongoing, and I'm sending a detailed summary of our conversation, the applied credits, and your new plan details to your updated email address right now.
