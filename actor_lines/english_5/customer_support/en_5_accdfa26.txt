=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Oh great great great, another human. Your website's a masterpiece of confusion, I think.

Customer Support: *exhales* I hear you completely. Let me pull up your account—what's your email? Our self-service portal's been... it's like a... maze lately. Even we struggle with it internally.

Customer: Let me see here... jackson.torres at gmail. The password reset loop? Pure comedy gold.

Customer Support: Found you. Jackson Torres, account ID JT-4829-XK. Yeah. The reset loop. We've had seventeen complaints just today about that specific issue.

Customer: Seventeen? That's probably... what, half the people who actually bothered calling?

Customer Support: More like a tenth. *sharp inhale* Listen, between us? The whole portal needs rebuilding. Your last login attempt was September 23rd at 2:47 PM. Three password resets. None went through.

Customer: Three? Try six. Unless your system can't count either.

Customer Support: Six total. You're right. System only logs successful attempts. The failed ones from September 21st and 22nd... they're in a different... what's the term... error database.

Customer: Hmm, okay so basically I'm locked out forever unless you fix it?

Customer Support: Not forever. Here's what I can do. Manual override code MO-7739-BT2. Expires in twenty-four hours. Skip the portal completely.

Customer: Wait wait wait, there's a way around it? Why isn't that anywhere online?

Customer Support: Honestly? Because they want you using the automated system. *exhales* But since that's clearly not... functioning... I'm authorizing direct account access through our backup channel, portal code PC-8827-QM.

Customer: Okay okay, I'm actually... this might work. You're sort of my hero right now.

Customer Support: Just doing my job. Really though, document everything. Reference number REF-20240924-JT829. If it fails again, any rep can see I authorized the bypass.

Customer: Let me just—I'm writing this down. The override thing expires tomorrow?

Customer Support: Right. 3:15 PM Eastern tomorrow, September 25th. After that you'd need another override. But this should resolve everything today.

Customer: You know what? This is—this is actually helpful. Thanks for being real about it.

Customer Support: Of course. We know it's frustrating. Your account shows three years loyal customer. Priority support tier starting October 1st—you've earned it.

Customer: Priority tier? That's... huh. Maybe staying was worth it.

Customer Support: Definitely worth it. Ticket number TK-98234-XQP is open for follow-up. I'm here Tuesdays through Saturdays. Ask for Dana. Extension 4021.
