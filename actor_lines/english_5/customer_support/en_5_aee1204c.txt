Scenario: wanting to cancel an order that's already being processed

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Hi, I—I need to cancel an order, I think? If that's still possible, I mean...

Customer Support: *exhales* Oh, let me pull that up for you. What's the order number?

Customer: It's it's ORD-8923-JK, sorry, I just—I ordered it maybe an hour ago?

Customer Support: Hmm, okay I see it here. ORD-8923-JK, placed at 2:47 PM. *sharp inhale* Oh. So the thing is, it's already moved to fulfillment status FUL-829.

Customer: Oh no, really? I'm sorry, I should have—I should have called sooner...

Customer Support: No no, don't apologize. Happens all the time. *exhales* Let me check what I can do. System shows it's in pick-and-pack phase 2, but hasn't hit shipping yet.

Customer: I know this is probably such a pain, I just—my husband already bought the same thing and we don't need two...

Customer Support: Totally get it. Trust me, I've done that myself. *soft exhale* Alright, so technically once it hits status code P2, we're not supposed to cancel, but lemme try something here.

Customer: I mean if it's too much trouble, maybe we could just return it when it arrives or...

Customer Support: No, hang on. Actually—yeah, caught it. Override code OVR-7823 accepted. Your refund should process in 3-5 business days to the card ending in 4782.

Customer: Oh my God, thank you thank you! I was so worried I'd messed everything up.

Customer Support: *exhales* Honestly? You saved us both hassle. Returns take forever. Tracking number would've been TRK-9982-XLM but now we don't need it.

Customer: You're being so kind about this, I know I know it's probably annoying when people do this...

Customer Support: You're fine, really. *inhale* Between you and me? Way easier than the guy who called about his order from 2019 earlier. Your cancellation reference is CAN-5544-RT if you need it.

Customer: That's—wow, 2019? Okay okay, I don't feel as bad now.

Customer Support: Right? *soft laugh, exhale* Anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I think that's—actually wait, the refund will definitely go through, right?

Customer Support: Absolutely. You'll get an email confirmation at the address on file within 30 minutes. Reference number REF-9102-KK. If you don't see it, check spam.

Customer: Perfect, and um, sorry again for the hassle, I really appreciate you helping me sort of fumble through this...

Customer Support: *warm exhale* Seriously, no worries. This was easy. Have a good rest of your day, yeah?
