=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So I got this... what's the word... invoice? Bill. My liability went up. Way up.

Customer Support: Okay okay, let me—let me pull that up for you right away, um, can I get your policy number? It should start with TL and then...

Customer: TL-4-8-2-9. I'm probably missing something obvious here.

Customer Support: Got it got it, TL-4829, perfect, and I see here you're listed as a tree service professional, policy active since March 2022, and your premium just renewed on December 1st at... oh. That's quite a jump.

Customer: Yeah. Eight hundred more. Per month. So basically I'm just... confused.

Customer Support: Right right, I'm seeing it went from $485 to $1,285 monthly, that's—that's a significant increase, let me check check if there's any claims or incidents that might have triggered this adjustment.

Customer: There's nothing. No claims. I haven't done anything wrong. Have I?

Customer Support: No no no, you're absolutely right, zero claims filed, perfect record actually, five-star safety rating as of November 15th, so this isn't about anything you did, let me dig deeper into what caused...

Customer: Maybe I forgot to file something? Update something?

Customer Support: Actually I—I think I found it, there's a code here, RISK-ADJ-2024-Q4, and it looks like your entire region got reclassified for higher risk after those storms in October, affecting all policies renewed after November 30th.

Customer: So it's... not just me then. That's something at least.

Customer Support: Definitely not just you, this affected, um, let me see... 847 commercial policies in your ZIP code area, but I understand that doesn't make the increase any easier to handle.

Customer: Is there like a... I don't know. Payment plan? Something?

Customer Support: Yes yes, absolutely, we have—we have several options actually, there's a quarterly payment plan that would break it down to $3,855 every three months instead of monthly, or we could look at adjusting coverage limits to bring the premium down.

Customer: The coverage though. Can't really cut that. Tree falls on someone's house...

Customer Support: You're you're absolutely right to be careful about that, your current coverage is $2 million general liability which is—which is standard for your industry, but wait, I'm seeing something else here...

Customer: Something good? Or...

Customer Support: Actually yes, there's a safety certification discount code CERT-SAFE-90 that could apply if you have current ISA credentials, that would reduce your premium by 15 percent, bringing it down to about $1,092 monthly.

Customer: I do have that. The ISA thing. So basically that would help. A bit.

Customer Support: It would it would, and you know what? Let me also schedule you for a full policy review with our commercial specialist on December 18th at 2:00 PM, they might find additional discounts, because honestly? An increase like this with your perfect record... we should explore every option we have.
