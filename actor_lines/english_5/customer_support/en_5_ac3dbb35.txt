=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Great. So I'm calling about—wait no, June. June's bill. You guys charged me twice.

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Oh gosh okay let me pull up your account real quick here, um, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with it? I'm seeing a bunch of June transactions in our system today actually, we're having a bit of a—anyway what's that number?

Customer: It's it's 415-7829. Look, I know it's October. I just—I just noticed.

Customer Support: *exhales* Alright perfect, so I've got your account here, customer ID 48829-JK, and hmm I'm scrolling through June's billing and—oh wait yep there it is, I see two charges on June 14th for $89.99 each, transaction references TXN-6677-A and TXN-6677-B, that's definitely not right.

Customer: Yeah. Shocking. Took three months to notice—sorry, four months. Four.

Customer Support: *soft exhale* No no totally understandable, honestly these duplicate charges happen more than they should, er, let me just check the payment processor logs real quick... okay so both charges cleared your card ending in 4429 at exactly 11:47 PM, which usually means our system hiccupped during processing.

Customer: Course it did. So can you just—wait, both went through? Both both?

Customer Support: Unfortunately yeah, both hit your account, but hey good news is I can absolutely issue that refund right now, it'll be credit reference REF-10293-X for the full $89.99, should hit your account in 3-5 business days, though between you and me it's usually faster like 2-3 days.

Customer: Okay okay. That's—no wait, business days? Not regular days?

Customer Support: *inhale* Right yeah business days, so not counting weekends, which I know is annoying but that's just how our payment processor handles it, um, since today's Tuesday October 17th you should see it by Friday the 20th at the latest, possibly as early as Thursday.

Customer: Thursday. Friday. Whatever. Least it's getting fixed.

Customer Support: Absolutely, and actually I'm gonna add a note here, case number CS-77812-M, so if for some reason it doesn't show up by Friday—which it should, it definitely should—but just call back with that case number and we can escalate it immediately.

Customer: If if it doesn't show. Great. More calling. Love that.

Customer Support: *sigh* Yeah I know, I really do, err, but honestly these refunds, they're pretty reliable, like 99% success rate according to our metrics dashboard here, the only time we see delays is when there's a bank holiday or something weird with the card processor.

Customer: Bank holiday. In October. Sure sure.

Customer Support: Hah, well, Columbus Day just passed but that already—anyway look I'm also applying a $10 courtesy credit, code SORRY-1017, to your account for the inconvenience, so your next bill dated November 1st will show that credit applied automatically.

Customer: Ten whole dollars. I'm rich. No no, that's—thanks. Actually helps.

Customer Support: *exhale* Hey I get it, should've caught this months ago right? Hmm, you know what, let me check if there were any other duplicate charges... *inhale* okay good news, June was the only month with that issue, your July bill was $89.99, August was $92.14, September was $89.99, all single charges, so this was just a one-time glitch.

Customer: One time. Till next time. But yeah, okay okay, we're good.

Customer Support: Perfect, so just to recap everything: refund of $89.99 with reference REF-10293-X will post by Friday October 20th, plus that $10 credit on your November bill, and your case number CS-77812-M is all documented here if you need to follow up, though *soft exhale* fingers crossed you won't need to!
