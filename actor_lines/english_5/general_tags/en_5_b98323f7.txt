Scenario: A lab assistant confronts the product manager who rushed their drug to market, resulting in three deaths from untested interactions.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] You said my compound would help people, Rebecca, that we'd take our time with the trials and make sure everything was perfect before launch.

Character 2: I know what I said, but the board wanted results by Q3, and your initial data looked so promising that pushing ahead seemed like the right call.

Character 1: [voice getting smaller] Three people died because we didn't run the interaction tests with common blood pressure medications, tests I begged you to let me complete. [swallows hard]

Character 2: Every pharmaceutical has risks, and we followed FDA guidelines to the letter—those interactions were statistically improbable based on your preliminary models, remember?

Character 1: [almost whispered] Improbable.

Character 2: Look, I understand you're upset, but dwelling on what happened six months ago won't bring those people back or change the fact that the drug helped thousands of others.

Character 1: I keep their names on a Post-it note above my bench—Margaret Chen, Robert Torres, Jamal Washington—and every morning I think about the two weeks we could have used. [voice cracking]

Character 2: [defensive] You think I don't remember them? I testified at the hearings, faced their families, took responsibility while you hid in your lab refusing to answer anyone's calls.

Character 1: [barely audible] Because I knew what we'd done the moment I saw the first adverse event report, knew we'd chosen speed over safety like every cautionary tale I studied in grad school.

Character 2: We made a business decision based on the data available at the time, and yes, it went wrong, but that's the nature of innovation—sometimes you fail. [sighs heavily]

Character 1: Fail? [quieter still] We didn't fail a test or miss a deadline, we put poison in medicine bottles because quarterly earnings mattered more than my concerns.

Character 2: That's not fair and you know it—I fought for your project when everyone else wanted to kill it after the mouse studies showed irregularities.

Character 1: [fading] Maybe you should have let them.

Character 2: So what, you're just going to keep shrinking into yourself, becoming this ghost haunting the lab at 2 AM running the same analyses over and over? [frustrated exhale]

Character 1: I run them because I keep finding things we missed, little signals in the data that should have warned us if we'd just looked closer, taken more time. [voice breaking]

Character 2: [softer] The review board cleared us both, said our protocols were standard for accelerated approval pathways, that no one could have predicted those specific drug interactions without extensive testing.

Character 1: [almost inaudible] But I could have predicted them if you'd given me two more weeks, and now I can't even look at my own research without seeing their faces.

Character 2: You want to know what I see when I look back? A brilliant scientist who created something that's helped twelve thousand people manage chronic pain, even if we lost three along the way.

Character 1: [whispered] Those three had names.

Character 2: [quietly resigned] I know their names, David. I wake up at 3 AM reciting them like some kind of penance, but we can't change what happened, only what comes next.
