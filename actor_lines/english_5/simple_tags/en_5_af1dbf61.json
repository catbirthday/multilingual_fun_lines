[bitter] I've been here three years now, fixing all the machines that keep people breathing while they detox from whatever they've been shooting up.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"Character 1\", \"content\": \"[hesitantly] Look, I know this is, um, incredibly awkward but we need to be professional here. [quietly] These ankle monitors are for people trying to rebuild their lives, and I really need them calibrated properly by tomorrow.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"Character 2\", \"content\": \"[sarcastically] Oh right, you're the big savior now, helping all the addicts get their lives together. [harshly] Where was all that compassion when Dad was drinking himself to death in our living room?\"},\n        {\"role\": \"Character 1\", \"content\": \"[defensively] That's not fair and you know it! I was seventeen, what was I supposed to do?

That's rich. [accusingly] You literally changed your last name so nobody would connect you to our junkie mother or our drunk father when you got this fancy coordinator job.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"Character 1\", \"content\": \"[voice breaking] I changed it because I couldn't [sighs] I couldn't walk into courtrooms and have defense attorneys Google our family and use it against my participants, okay?

It's really good to see you, even if, you know, this isn't how I imagined it happening after seven years.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"Character 2\", \"content\": \"[softly] Yeah, well, life's funny that way.
