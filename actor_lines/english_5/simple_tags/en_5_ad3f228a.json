            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[anxious] The thing is, it's not just about claiming them—some of these objects shouldn't be separated from each other. [quickly] The singing bowls need to stay with the meditation cushions, and the sage bundles were blessed together as a set."

            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[curiously] How can you tell the difference? Because looking around here, I'm realizing I don't even know the stories behind half of these things. [sighs] I spent so many years away, living my own path."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[kindly] Usually it's in the placement and care—treasured items are displayed prominently, kept clean, positioned where they'd be seen daily. [softly] Your grandmother's crystals, for instance, they're perfectly arranged and not a speck of dust on them."
