Subject: Discovering your trusted wealth manager embezzled your entire retirement fund

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: No, this can't be right. There's got to be—let me refresh this again. [confused] Zero? That's not... Harold's been managing this for fifteen years. [very quietly] Oh God. The transfers, all those transfers last month, he said they were for tax purposes. [pause] I'm looking at the statements and it's just... gone. Everything. Twenty-three years of saving, my whole retirement, it's—wait, there's another account here, maybe it's... [hopefully] No. That's empty too. [shaky voice] How did I not see this? I mean, I trusted him completely, we had dinner at his house last month with his kids and—[gasp loudly] Oh my God, is that why he was being so nice? [angry] All those reassurances about the market being volatile, telling me not to check so often. "Leave it to me, Sandra, that's what you pay me for." [bitter] Right. That's exactly what I was paying him for. [crying while speaking] I can't retire now. I'm sixty-one years old and I have nothing. Absolutely nothing. My sister warned me about keeping everything with one person but Harold was—he was like family, you know? [furious] Twenty-three years! I worked doubles, I skipped vacations, I drove that awful car for a decade because I was saving and he just... took it? [very quietly] What am I supposed to do now?
