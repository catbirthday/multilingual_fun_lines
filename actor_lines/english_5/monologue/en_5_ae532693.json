Tuesday morning, I'm in Henderson's office and he's shaking my hand, telling me I earned this, that I'm, uh, exactly what they need. [pause] And Tuesday night I'm sitting in our—in my apartment, looking at the closet with all her stuff gone. [sigh] You know what's really messed up? I keep wanting to call her. Like, \"Hey, guess what, I finally got the promotion!\" But then I remember she's the one who said I cared more about the restaurant than... well. [hesitantly] Maybe she was right? I don't know. Thirty-eight events next month. That's what I'm managing now. Weddings, corporate dinners, all of it. [very sad] Funny how I'll be organizing other people's celebrations while my own life is just... [trailing off] Err, I should probably feel happy, right? Or at least, I don't know, proud or something? [frustrated] But I just feel empty.
