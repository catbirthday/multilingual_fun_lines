Subject: Your rigging artist safety protocols were ignored, resulting in a performer's serious injury that could have been prevented

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [angry] I wrote it all down. Every single safety concern. The load limits, the backup systems, the inspection schedule—everything. Three weeks ago. Three weeks! And they just... they ignored it. [pause] Said it would delay the show, cost too much. Cost too much. [bitter] You know what costs too much? Marina in the hospital with a shattered pelvis because the rigging failed exactly where I said it would. [voice shaking] I keep seeing it happen. The way the cable just snapped and she fell—God, the sound she made when she hit. [pause] Twenty-two years I've been doing this job. Twenty-two years and I've never had anyone get hurt on my watch because I check everything, I double-check, I triple-check. But what's the point if they don't, um... if they don't listen? [frustrated] I should've refused to sign off on it. Should've walked away, called the union, done something more than just write a report that ended up in someone's trash. [sigh] Marina's mom called me yesterday. Thanked me for visiting. Thanked me. Like I didn't fail her daughter. [quietly] I don't know if I can do this anymore. Not if my expertise means nothing. Not if people get hurt because someone upstairs thinks they know better. [determined] But I saved those emails. Every single one.
