And then he just... broke down. [confused] Right there in front of everyone. Started talking about his dad and the, um... the things that happen at home. [pause] God, I didn't—I had no idea. All this time I thought he was just cruel because he enjoyed it, but he's getting hit. Like, actually hit. [very quietly] His dad burns him with cigarettes when he's drunk. \n\n[upset] And now I don't know what to feel because, yeah, what he did to me was awful—the names, the shoving, making my life hell for two years—but he's just... he's just a kid dealing with something so much worse. [sigh] I keep thinking about how he flinched when I raised my voice. That wasn't about me, was it? [empathetically] That was him expecting to get hurt. \n\nDang, I wanted to hate him so badly. [sad] It was easier when he was just the villain, you know? But now he's this broken person who's been, um... who's been crying for help this whole time and nobody noticed. Not even me. [long pause] What am I supposed to do with this?"
