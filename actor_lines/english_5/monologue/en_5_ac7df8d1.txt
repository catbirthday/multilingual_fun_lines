Subject: Your freight forwarder logistics preventing a medical supply shortage during the emergency

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] Okay, okay, we've got seventeen hours before those ventilators are supposed to be at the hospital. [speeding up] The original flight got cancelled, the backup carrier just told me their plane has mechanical issues, and we're looking at—what, three thousand units stuck in customs? [frustrated] This cannot be happening right now. [pause] [determined] No, you know what? We're going to figure this out. [quickly] I'm calling that charter company, the one from the pharmaceutical shipment last month. They owe me a favor. [cough] And if that doesn't work, I've got, um... I've got connections at the military base. [confidently] They run medical supply flights sometimes. [relieved] Wait, hold on—Jenny just texted me. [excited] She found a cargo plane leaving in two hours! [laugh] Oh my god, yes, this is it. [passionately] We can reroute through Memphis, clear customs there—they're faster—and still make the deadline. [sigh] I mean, it's going to cost us triple the normal rate, but honestly? [warm] When you see those supplies rolling into the ICU, when you know that you just prevented... [trailing off] I don't know, it's worth every penny. [proudly] This is why we do this job. [exhausted] God, I need coffee.
