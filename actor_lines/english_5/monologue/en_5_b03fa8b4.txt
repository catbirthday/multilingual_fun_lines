Subject: Your exonerated status finally came through after ten years in prison, but your family has moved on without you

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] Ten years. God, ten years and it's finally— [pause] They said exonerated. [bitter] That word, you know? Like it erases everything. [slowly] I kept thinking when I got out, we'd just... pick up where we left off. [laugh] Stupid, right? [very sad] My daughter, she's, um... she's fifteen now. [hesitantly] She was five when they took me. Five. [pause] And my wife—ex-wife, I guess—she remarried last year. [quietly] They sent me the photos. [frustrated] Everyone's moved on and I'm just... I'm standing here with this piece of paper that says I'm innocent. [angry] Like that means something now! [long pause] [exhausted] My brother, he picked me up today and he kept talking about, uhh, "fresh starts" and "new beginnings" and I wanted to scream. [very melancholic] There's no fresh start when you've missed... everything. [sigh] First days of school, birthdays, Christmases. [shaky voice] My mom died while I was in there. [pause] [confused] So what do I do now, hmm? Everyone's got their lives and I'm... I'm like a ghost, you know? [bitter] Walking around in a world that just, er, kept spinning without me. [very quietly] They all learned how to be happy without me.
