My agent called this morning like it was nothing. \"Creative differences with the new edit,\" she said. [frustrated] Creative differences? I hand-painted forty-seven buildings, each window, each reflection— I mean, I literally dreamed about those streets. [pause] You know what the worst part is? I turned down that Netflix series for this. The one everyone's talking about now. Because THIS was supposed to be my Blade Runner moment, my— my calling card, you know? [sad] And now it's just files on a hard drive that nobody will ever see. [sigh] My mom keeps asking when she can see my name in the credits. What do I tell her? That I'm still just the invisible artist? That my breakthrough is, um... is sitting in some editor's trash folder? [angry] They didn't even have the decency to tell me themselves. I had to find out from my agent who found out from someone's assistant. [long pause] I don't know if I can keep doing this. Starting over every time, hoping the next one will be different. [exhausted] Maybe I should've just become an accountant like Dad wanted."
