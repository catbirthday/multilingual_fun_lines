Subject: Winning the lawsuit against your former employer while watching them destroy evidence of other people's cases

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] Finally. Three years of my life, and it's finally over. They had to pay every cent. Every single cent they owed me. [pause] But I'm watching them right now through the window and they're—they're just shredding everything. Box after box. [confused] Those aren't my files, those are... oh my god, those are from the harassment cases. The other women who came forward. [gasp] They're destroying it all. Right there in broad daylight like it doesn't even matter. [bitter] Of course. Of course they are. My lawyer said this might happen—settle with one person, bury the rest. [anxious] But seeing it actually happen is, um... it's different. [angry] Those are people's lives in those boxes! Sarah from accounting, she told me what happened to her. And Marcus, he tried to file a complaint twice. [shaky voice] I got my justice but they're making sure nobody else will. [pause] Should I be filming this? Is that even legal? [frustrated] God, I feel sick. Here I am with my settlement check and they're just—they're laughing in there. Actually laughing while they feed another box into the shredder. [very quietly] This isn't winning. Not really. [bitter] Not when everyone else loses.
