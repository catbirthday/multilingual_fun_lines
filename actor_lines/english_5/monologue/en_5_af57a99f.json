[pause] When I was your age, I thought I had to have everything figured out immediately. [regretful] I pushed away so many good people because I was too focused on this imaginary timeline I'd created. [sigh] Like, I literally ended a three-year friendship because she wanted to take a gap year and I thought that was, um... I thought that meant she wasn't serious about life. [sad] Can you believe that? [short pause] I missed her wedding last year. [very sincerely] The thing is, nobody actually has it figured out. [chuckle] I'm twenty-five and I still call my mom when I get a weird bill in the mail. [animated] But here's what I wish someone had told me—those detours everyone warns you about? [passionate] They're not detours, they're just... life. [slowly] That semester I \"wasted\" working at that coffee shop taught me more about people than any psychology class. [confident] So when everyone's telling you to stay focused, to not get distracted—sometimes the distractions are, uh, they're actually the important parts. [empathetically] Trust yourself more than you trust anyone else's blueprint for your life, okay? [hopeful] Because your mistakes won't be my mistakes anyway."
