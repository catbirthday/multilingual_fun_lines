Subject: Your rebel phase in college is now embarrassing but also gave you the confidence to start your own business

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [chuckle] Oh God, I found my old college photos yesterday and... yowza. The mohawk, the leather jacket with all those pins—I mean, I thought I was so edgy, you know? [embarrassed] Walking around campus quoting Nietzsche to anyone who'd listen. Like, who was that person? 

[sigh] The thing is, er, looking back now it's actually... hmm, it's complicated. Because yeah, obviously it's mortifying—I literally told my economics professor that money was a social construct and refused to turn in assignments on principle. [laugh] But also, I guess that whole phase taught me something? 

[slowly] That version of me, she just... she didn't care what anyone thought. And that's sort of what you need when you're starting a business, right? Everyone telling you it won't work, that you're being ridiculous. [pause] 

I remember standing up in that business seminar, wearing ripped fishnets and combat boots, pitching my idea while everyone just stared. [confidently] But I didn't back down. Same energy, just... channeled differently now, I suppose.

[warm] So yeah, it's embarrassing as hell, but without that weird rebellious phase, I don't think I'd have had the guts to quit my corporate job and actually do this. Sometimes you need to be a little ridiculous first to figure out who you really are.
