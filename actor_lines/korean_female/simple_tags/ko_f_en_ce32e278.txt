=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I, um, I used to know someone who worked here, er, arranging these apples the same, [shaky voice], careful way you do, and I mean, [quietly], she had your exact same gentle touch with the fruit.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] That's an odd thing to notice about someone, [curious], but I've been working here for five years now.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Five years is a long time to be away from someone you, [regretful], watched grow up learning which tomatoes were ripe just by, [trailing off], touch... [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Wait, how do you know about that, because my, [stern], father taught me that specific technique when I was little on our, [trembling], farm before everything fell apart. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Sarah, it's me, and I know I don't, [ashamed], look like the man who raised you anymore but I've been, [whispering], watching you succeed here from across the street every morning.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Dad? No, you can't be— Mom said you, [angry], died in that accident five years ago when the farm went into, [bitter], foreclosure after the drought destroyed everything. [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Well, um, I couldn't, er, face you.

Character 2 [en]: Um, you just, uh, disappeared.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] After losing the farm I became someone I didn't recognize, [frustrated], sleeping under bridges and eating from dumpsters while you and your mother, [very quietly], deserved so much better than a broken failure.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] We never wanted you to be perfect, [tearfully], just present in our lives.

Character 1 [en]: But, um, how could I come home empty-handed when I'd, [monotone], promised to give you everything, I mean, when all I had left was, er, shame?

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] You think I care about money when I spent five years believing my, [upset], father was dead while Mom cried herself to sleep wondering if she could have, [loudly], saved you somehow?

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Um, your mother still, er, thinks about me after everything I, [exhausted], put her through?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering loudly] Every single day.

Character 1 [en]: The truth is I've been living four blocks away, [slowly], watching you both from a distance and writing letters I could never, [mumbling], send.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Well, um, you're here now and that's what, [cheerful], matters because we can start rebuilding what we lost. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I mean, look at me Sarah, uh, I smell like the streets and, [embarrassed], my hands shake from years of cheap liquor trying to, um, forget.

Character 2 [en]: Er, those hands still know how to tell when fruit is perfectly ripe, and um, that's the father I remember who taught me everything about, [very sincerely], growing things from nothing which is exactly what we'll do with our, [hopeful], family.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You learned to see potential in damaged produce that others would, [emotional], throw away just like you're seeing something worth saving in me, [voice breaking], right now.

Character 2 [en]: [confident] Come home with me after my shift because Mom's making that, [playful], vegetable soup you loved and there's always been an empty chair that we've been, [whispering], saving for you. [long pause]
