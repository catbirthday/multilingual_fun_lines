=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stern] So, um, I found something really interesting when I was, [confused], browsing music platforms last night, and well, I heard my composition, [angry], the one I wrote specifically for our lessons together.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I can explain if you'd just, [hesitantly], listen to me for a second instead of jumping to, [anxious], conclusions about what you think you, [trailing off]...

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Um, you know, I've been teaching you for free for, like, two years because I believed in your talent and, [frustrated], this is how you repay that trust, by, [loudly], stealing my work? [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] It wasn't stealing. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] Not stealing?

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Well, um, I mean...

Character 1 [en]: Um, er, what then?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Look, I mean, um, the recordings were just supposed to be, [shaky voice], practice demos at first, but then someone offered me money and I, well, [desperate], needed it for my mom's medical bills, you know? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Well, um, why didn't you just, er, ask me for help instead of, [disappointed], going behind my back like this, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: Um, because, well, I couldn't.

Character 1 [en]: You couldn't ask for help but, um, you could secretly record our sessions and, like, [furious], sell my original compositions without even telling me they were being, [very loudly], distributed online?

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I know it was wrong, okay, but, um, you don't understand what it's like to watch your mother, [whispering], suffer while you can't afford her treatments, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] I actually do understand, um, more than you know, because my father died when I couldn't afford his, [sad], cancer treatments either, well.

Character 2 [en]: The money from those recordings is literally keeping her, [trembling], alive right now and I can't just stop. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] So, um, instead of destroying what we've built together, why don't we, like, [confidently], make this legitimate and split the earnings properly while, er, [excited], creating something that could actually help both our families, you know? [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] You would actually consider, [curious], working with me after what I did? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: I see someone who was, um, desperate enough to betray trust but, [sincerely], talented enough to make those recordings worth something, and maybe, well, [hopeful], honest enough now to make this right.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Um, I, er, don't know...

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Either we do this properly with contracts and proper credit, or, um, I take legal action for the theft of my intellectual property, and, well, [challenging], nobody wins anything then, especially not, [coldly], your mother.

Character 2 [en]: You're right, um, I mean, completely right, and I want to, [eager], make this work if you're really willing to give me, [overwhelmed], another chance after everything. [cry]
