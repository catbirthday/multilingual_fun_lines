=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I've been watching you across the room for, [nervous], an hour trying to figure out how to, [whispering], ask you something that's been eating at me.

Character 2 [en]: Whatever you're about to ask me at grandma's birthday, [confused], probably isn't something I should be, [stern], hearing if you're this worked up about it. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: You know how Marcus completely destroyed my consulting business by, [bitter], stealing all my clients and spreading lies about my work ethics. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: That was three years ago and you're still, [exhausted], bringing this up at every single family gathering we have.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Well, um, the thing is, I know what you do for a living, and, umm, I was wondering if you could, [shaky voice], help me make sure certain things about Marcus show up when people, you know, search for him online.

Character 2 [en]: Are you seriously asking me to tank someone's search results, [angry], right here next to the potato salad?

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Look, I mean, I'm not asking you to lie or anything, just, um, maybe make sure the, [very quietly], truth about what he did becomes more, you know, [trailing off], visible when people Google him...

Character 2 [en]: This conversation needs to stop before someone, [worried], overhears what you're suggesting. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: Nobody's listening because they're all focused on, [frustrated], Uncle Jerry's stories but I need you to understand that Marcus, [trembling], ruined my entire life.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] What you're describing could get me blacklisted from, [empathetically], every legitimate SEO network and destroy the reputation I've spent, [slowly], ten years building in this industry.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] So, um, you're telling me that, well, family means nothing when it comes to your precious professional ethics? [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Family means everything which is, um, exactly why I won't let you, [firmly], drag me into something that could, you know, destroy both our careers. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: If you had any idea what it feels like to have everything, [crying while speaking], taken away by someone you trusted completely.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Listen, I mean, I understand you're hurting, but, um, revenge through search manipulation isn't going to heal what Marcus did.

Character 1 [en]: Then what exactly do you suggest I do when he's out there, [loudly], winning awards with the business model he stole from me?

Character 2 [en]: Build something better than what you had before and let, [confidently], your success be the thing that shows up in, [passionately], search results instead of manufactured negativity.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] You know, maybe I shouldn't have, um, brought this up here, but, well, I'm just so tired of watching him succeed with my ideas. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: The best revenge is living well and ranking higher, [playful], organically through actual accomplishments rather than, [gently], dirty tricks that would make us no better than him. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] You're right and I hate that you're right because it means I have to, [sad], actually do the work instead of taking shortcuts but I guess that's, [monotone], what separates us from people like Marcus. [deep breath]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Look, um, if you want, I can teach you legitimate SEO strategies to, [friendly], build your new venture properly so that, you know, when people search for your industry, well, they find you first.
