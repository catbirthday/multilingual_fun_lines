=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [professional] Miss Rivera, I need you to understand that posting your brunch location just, [stern], put three federal agents at risk trying to secure that restaurant.

Character 2 [en]: [entitled] My followers have a right to know where I am and what I'm, [frustrated], eating because that's literally how I make my, [loudly], six-figure monthly income.

Character 1 [en]: The cartel members you accidentally livestreamed executing that judge are, [anxious], actively hunting you right now using those exact posts. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastic] Oh please, like they're going to find me among my, [dismissive], twelve million followers who track my every move, [rolling eyes], anyway.

Character 1 [en]: We've already intercepted two assassination attempts because you, [furious], geotagged your safe house and then posted about the, [very quietly], 'boring government protection detail.'

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, my brand is about authenticity and transparency so I can't just, [upset], disappear without explanation when my engagement metrics are, [quickly], peaking from all this drama coverage. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Well, I mean, we've protected witnesses for, um, thirty years and never lost one, but, [bitter], we've also never had someone livestreaming their, [whispering loudly], location to potential killers every twenty minutes, you know?

Character 2 [en]: My manager says, um, this whole witness thing could be, [excited], great content if we spin it right, like, [confidently], maybe a documentary series or something, you know? [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Um, I mean, you do realize that, [angry], three people have already died because of what you witnessed, and, well, [shaky voice], you're treating this like it's some kind of, [very sad], reality show opportunity, right?

Character 2 [en]: [overly polite] I'm simply trying to maintain my livelihood while cooperating with your, [condescending], little investigation here, Marshal, which frankly seems, [mocking], overblown considering nothing has actually happened to me yet. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: Um, nothing has happened because, well, my team hasn't slept in, [worn out], seventy-two hours keeping you alive, you know. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, what?

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] So, um, here's what's going to happen—you're going dark on social media for, I mean, [empathetically], forty-eight hours while we relocate you, or well, [clearing throat], I walk away right now.

Character 2 [en]: You can't just threaten to abandon me when I'm apparently in, [terrified], mortal danger according to you people who keep, [crying while speaking], showing me photos of crime scenes that look like horror movies!

Character 1 [en]: [warm] I'm not threatening you, I'm trying to save your life despite your, [frustrated], complete inability to grasp that fame won't protect you from, [slowly], professional killers who've murdered federal judges.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, um, I know I've been difficult but, like, this is literally my entire identity we're talking about and, well, [hesitantly], I don't know who I am without the camera, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [short pause] Better alive and unknown.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe you're right about the posting but I need, [regretful], something to hold onto when my whole world is, [very meekly], falling apart like this. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Well, um, I've seen people rebuild their lives from witness protection and, I mean, [hopeful], sometimes losing everything forces you to find, [gently], who you really are underneath all the noise, you know?

Character 2 [en]: I guess, um, being dead would probably hurt my engagement rates more than, well, [bitter laugh], going dark for a few days while you guys, like, [resigned], do whatever it is you do, right? [deep sigh]
