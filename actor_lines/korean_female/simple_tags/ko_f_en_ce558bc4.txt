Scenario: A carbon footprint analyst confronts their exact lookalike who has been impersonating them at climate conferences to promote fossil fuel interests for money.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You've been using my face to, [shouting], undermine everything I've worked for, spreading lies about climate data at conferences I've never, [bitter], even attended!

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] That's quite an accusation.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Three separate colleagues sent me videos of, [confused], 'me' claiming that carbon offsets are sufficient while dismissing renewable energy as, [frustrated], economically unfeasible nonsense.

Character 2 [en]: [condescending] Perhaps your colleagues are simply mistaken about who they, [slowly], saw speaking at those events.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, um, I ran facial recognition software on the footage and, well, [shaky voice], the match is ninety-nine point eight percent, so like, [loudly], you can't deny this anymore, you know. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, having a similar face doesn't mean I'm, [defensive], impersonating you, I mean, that's quite a leap.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You know, um, what really gets me is that you're, [whispering], wearing my exact presentation outfit while, er, [very quietly], destroying my reputation with oil executives paying you to be me. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: So, um, what if hypothetically someone needed the money and, well, [regretful], happened to look exactly like a prominent analyst, and, you know, [trailing off], certain opportunities presented themselves that were hard to refuse.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Well, um, those 'opportunities' you mentioned have resulted in, [anxious], my research being discredited and, like, death threats from environmental groups who think I've betrayed them.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, um, I never intended for things to escalate, er, [nervous], this far with the impersonation thing, you know.

Character 1 [en]: Um, you literally gave a keynote speech last week claiming that, well, [mocking], fossil fuels are the bridge to sustainability, I mean, using my credentials.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Well, um, the people who hired me said it was just, [desperate], presenting alternative viewpoints, you know, for balance.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Alternative viewpoints that coincidentally align with the companies funding, [very loudly], climate denial campaigns.

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] The money was supposed to help me get out of, [whispering loudly], debt before anyone noticed.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] At least you're finally admitting it instead of, [coldly], continuing this pathetic charade.

Character 2 [en]: I mean, um, what exactly do you want from me now that, [defeated], everything's already ruined anyway, you know. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, um, you're going to publicly recant every statement you made as, [firmly], me, admit the deception, er, and testify about who paid you.

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, these aren't the kind of people who, [frightened], let witnesses testify, and, well, [very melancholic], we both have the same face they'll be looking for.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Then we need to work together because they've made us both, [passionately], targets now whether we like it or not, and only the truth can protect either of us from what's, [urgently], coming next. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: I suppose having an identical face means we're, [resigned], in this nightmare together now.
