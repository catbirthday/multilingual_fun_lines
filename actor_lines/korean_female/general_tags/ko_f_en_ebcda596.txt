=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Um, well, shall we begin?

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] I don't, um, remember much these days, you know, my mind isn't what it, [defensive], used to be and the doctors say, [trailing off], well, they say a lot of things about, [bitter], men my age. [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [cold] The photographs from the camps show you, [steady], quite clearly in uniform, standing beside the labor quotas you, [firm], personally signed, watching as children were, [disgusted], separated from their families.

Character 2 [en]: Those were, I mean, different times, you understand, we thought we were, [desperate], bringing civilization to places that had never known, [hollow], proper governance or modern infrastructure, [quieter], helping them really.

Character 1 [en]: [sharp] Helping them by, um, working them to death in copper mines, I mean, forcing entire villages to, [incredulous], meet impossible quotas while you lived in, [bitter], mansions built with their blood? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You speak as if we invented suffering when these tribes had been, [frustrated], enslaving each other for centuries before we ever, [louder], arrived with our maps and our, [faltering], supposed cruelty.

Character 1 [en]: [controlled] The testimony of survivors describes you personally selecting which men would be, [sickened], beaten for missing quotas, which women would serve in your, [revolted], household, which children would be taken to the, [breaking], mission schools.

Character 2 [en]: [weak] I don't, um, remember that.

Character 1 [en]: [leaning forward] You don't remember because it's, well, convenient to forget, or you don't remember because, um, there were so, [harsh], many incidents they all blur together into one long, [accusatory], colonial nightmare that you, [venomous], orchestrated? [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [agitated] Look, I mean, whatever you think you know from your, um, documents and testimonies, you weren't, [resentful], there in the heat and the disease and the, [angry], constant threat of uprising when every decision could mean, [fearful], life or death. [shaking]

Character 1 [en]: Life or death for whom exactly, because the records show that during your, [cold], twenty-year administration, not a single European died from uprising while, [measured], forty thousand locals perished from what you called, [mocking], maintaining order.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Those numbers are, [dismissive], inflated by people with agendas.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Well, um, I have their names, every single one documented by, [deliberate], missionaries who thought they were saving souls, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Um, I mean, please.

Character 1 [en]: Maria Kwete, age seven, died from exhaustion in the fields you, [steady], supervised; Thomas Banda, age forty-two, executed for, [harder], refusing to salute your flag; Rebecca Mushi, age nineteen, disappeared into your, [disgusted], personal compound. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [broken] I was, um, following orders from the homeland, you know, doing what any loyal citizen would, [weary], have done in service to, [hollow], the empire.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Every war criminal in history has claimed they were just following orders, yet you, [pointed], personally expanded those orders, invented new punishments that even your, [incredulous], superiors found excessive according to these, [waving papers], colonial office complaints.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] So what do you want from me now, I mean, an apology that, um, changes nothing, a confession that brings no one, [bitter], back from the dead, or just to watch an old, [exhausted], man finally admit what you already, [resigned], know to be true? [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: I want you to say their names, um, all forty thousand of them, to, [intense], acknowledge they were human beings not statistics, to stop, [fierce], hiding behind your convenient amnesia and false, [furious], civilizing missions. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] I remember, um, I remember everything, every face, every scream, and, [haunted], that's my real punishment, living with what I, [broken], became in that place.
