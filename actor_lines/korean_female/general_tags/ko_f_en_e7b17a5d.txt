Scenario: A podcast producer arrives at his brother-in-law's apartment to record an episode about family trauma, not knowing his sister has just filed for divorce.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So, um, I brought all the recording equipment like we discussed last week, and, well, I thought we could, er, talk about Dad's drinking and how it, [strained], affected both our families growing up.

Character 2 [en]: That's, [bitter], funny you want to talk about family trauma when you don't even, [hollow], know what's happening in your own sister's life right now.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What are you, umm, talking about—I just saw Emily at Sunday dinner and, well, everything seemed, [uncertain], fine between you two.

Character 2 [en]: [knowing] Fine—yeah, um, that's what she wanted everyone to think while she was, [calculating], already meeting with lawyers about custody arrangements and, well, [trembling], dividing up twelve years of our life together.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Wait, umm, Emily filed for divorce and didn't, [disbelieving], tell me anything about this—I mean, we talk every week and she never, [hurt], mentioned any problems between you two or, er, [voice cracking], anything like that. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [harsh] Of course she didn't tell you because you're always, [accusatory], too wrapped up in your podcast stories about other people's pain to notice when your own, [disgusted], sister has been dying inside for, [exhausted], two years.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] That's not fair—I've been, [frustrated], trying to build something meaningful here that helps people process their trauma while you've been, [angry], sitting in this apartment drinking yourself into the same, [bitter], hole our father dug. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [cold] At least I'm, um, honest about being broken instead of, [mocking], hiding behind a microphone pretending that talking about pain, well, [contemptuous], somehow fixes it when you can't even see your sister was, [breaking], drowning. [laughs darkly]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Maybe you're right that I've been, [ashamed], using other people's stories to avoid looking at my own family's, umm, [vulnerable], current disasters instead of just the old ones we can safely, [deflated], analyze. [voice trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [softer] You want to know the, [tired], real irony here?

Character 1 [en]: [weary] I'm listening now, er, really listening this time without the, [resigned], microphone between us or, well, any agenda about turning this into, [genuine], content.

Character 2 [en]: She said the reason she could finally, um, leave was because listening to your podcast about breaking cycles gave her the, [pained], courage to stop repeating our mother's pattern of, well, [raw], staying with someone who'd given up.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] So my work actually, um, inspired her to leave you while I was completely, [guilty], oblivious to what was even happening in her, er, [devastated], marriage.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Welcome to the club of people who thought they, [sardonic], knew Emily but only saw what she wanted them to see.

Character 1 [en]: [broken] What am I supposed to, umm, do with this information now? [struggling]

Character 2 [en]: You could start by actually, [harsh], being her brother instead of everyone's, [cutting], amateur therapist.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] You're, [honest], right.

Character 2 [en]: And maybe, um, while you're at it, you could, [exhausted], help me understand how the hell we both missed this coming.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] We were both looking at old wounds, well, instead of noticing the, [sad], new ones forming right in front of us, umm, weren't we?

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Pack up your equipment—we're not, [final], recording anything today except maybe the sound of everything, [broken], falling apart. [long silence]
