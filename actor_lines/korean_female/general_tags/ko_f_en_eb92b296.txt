Scenario: A trust fund kid visits their godfather in prison on the eve of his release after serving twenty years for taking the fall for their father's financial crimes.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Tomorrow you walk out of here after twenty years and I still, [guilty], can't look you in the eye knowing you took the fall for, [breaking], my father's crimes while I lived in luxury spending, [quieter], blood money.

Character 2 [en]: [steady] You were twelve.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Being twelve doesn't erase the fact that my trust fund, [choked], came from the pension funds you supposedly embezzled.

Character 2 [en]: Your father made his choice and I made mine, [resolute], both out of love for you.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Every birthday card you sent from this place, every letter telling me to, [anguished], stay in school and make something of myself while you, [voice cracking], rotted in here for crimes you didn't commit, [softer], it destroyed me.

Character 2 [en]: Listen, um, the hardest part wasn't the time I served, it was, well, watching you grow up through photographs. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] I should have, um, testified when I turned eighteen, I mean, told them what I saw that night in Dad's office, [ashamed], but I was a coward.

Character 2 [en]: You were protecting your mother who, um, would have lost everything, and I mean everything, including her, [gentle], will to live.

Character 1 [en]: She killed herself anyway when the guilt, [hollow], became unbearable three years later.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] I didn't, um, know that—they never told me she, [devastated], passed and your letters never, well, mentioned how, I mean, [trailing off], oh God. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, I couldn't bear to tell you that your sacrifice, [bitter laugh], didn't even save her in the end, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Your father promised me he'd, um, take care of both of you if I, well, kept quiet about the government contracts, [disgusted], the bribes.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] He took care of us alright—um, left us with millions in dirty money and, well, a legacy of shame that I, [spitting], can't wash off.

Character 2 [en]: You're not him—um, you never were, and I mean, that's why I could do this, [proud], watch you become someone good.

Character 1 [en]: [crying] Um, I liquidated everything last month, well, every property and investment he left me, and I'm giving it to the, [determined], families he destroyed because, um, that's what you would do. [sniffles]

Character 2 [en]: No, I mean, keep it. [firm]

Character 1 [en]: Uncle Tony, I mean, I can't build a life on, [disgusted], their suffering anymore than I can pretend you're not, well, my real father in every way that matters.

Character 2 [en]: Then we both walk out of our prisons, [warm], tomorrow and start clean because twenty years is, [emotional], enough punishment for everyone.

Character 1 [en]: I bought a small garage upstate where we could, [hopeful], restore old cars like we used to talk about when I was, [voice breaking], little before everything went to hell.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] Just like we planned.
