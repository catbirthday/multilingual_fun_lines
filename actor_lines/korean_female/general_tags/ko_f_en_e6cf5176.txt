=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky] The engines failed at thirty-two thousand feet and I had, [breathless], seventeen seconds to decide whether to attempt the impossible or, [cracking], accept that we were going down. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] You always did fly too close to, [gentle], disaster even as a child climbing those barn rafters until they, [worried], creaked and bent under your wild dreams.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitant] I kept thinking about, um, your hands working the leather, how you, [trembling], always said that, well, every stitch matters when someone's life depends on it.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Well, um, I suppose flying planes and, [careful], crafting saddles both require trusting your work will, er, hold when everything else falls apart.

Character 1 [en]: [breaking] Mom, I mean, when those passengers were screaming and, [desperate], the controls were dead in my hands, I, um, kept hearing your voice telling me to, [whispered], feel the rhythm like you taught me with the horses, to, well, find the current beneath the chaos.

Character 2 [en]: [protective] You were, um, always too much like your father, chasing, [bitter], the sky when the earth had everything you, well, needed right here in this dusty workshop.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I didn't leave to hurt you, I mean, the sky was calling and, [passionate], you of all people should understand following a craft that, um, chooses you rather than the other way around.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] Every saddle I've made since you left has your, [nostalgic], initials hidden in the underside stitching where no one but, [vulnerable], God would ever see them because I couldn't bear to let you, [cracking], go completely. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] I still have that, um, first leather wallet you made me and, [tender], every time turbulence hits I hold it like, well, some kind of talisman connecting me to, [choked], solid ground and you.

Character 2 [en]: The leather remembers everything you know, [wistful], every touch and tear and mend becomes, [philosophical], part of its story just like we carry our, [heavy], breaks and repairs.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Mom, um, I landed that plane using everything you taught me about, [grateful], feeling the material speak its needs, well, even if the material was aluminum and air instead of leather.

Character 2 [en]: [proud] My customers always say my saddles have a certain, [emotional], quality that makes their horses trust them more and now I, [understanding], know it's because I've been stitching my love for you into, [tender], every single piece. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: One hundred and forty-three souls landed safely because you, [awed], taught me that mastery isn't about control but about, [sincere], listening to what wants to give way and what wants to, [firm], hold.

Character 2 [en]: [careful] Well, um, I suppose there's room in this workshop for, [hopeful], both of us if you want to, er, learn how flying and saddling might be, well, different verses of the same song. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] The airline gave me six months leave to recover and I want to, [vulnerable], spend them here learning to work with my hands the way you, [earnest], always hoped I would before I lost myself to the clouds.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Your grandfather's tools are still hanging exactly where he, [melancholic], left them forty years ago waiting for someone who understands that, [wise], leather and sky both demand respect for the space between, [peaceful], control and surrender.

Character 1 [en]: Sometimes it takes almost dying to realize that the, [reflecting], ground you ran from was actually the foundation that, [emotional], kept you steady even at thirty thousand feet.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I saved every newspaper clipping about your flights even though reading them, [pained], felt like watching you fly further away, er, from me each time.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] I want to learn to make something that lasts longer than, [searching], a flight path, something that carries the weight of generations the way your, [reverent], saddles do.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Um, well, welcome home.
