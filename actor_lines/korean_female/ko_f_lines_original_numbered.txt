# Speaker Lines Only (Original English) - Korean (Female)
============================================================

1. [stunned] You always did fly too close to, [gentle], disaster even as a child climbing those barn rafters until they, [worried], creaked and bent under your wild dreams.
2. [soft] Well, um, I suppose flying planes and, [careful], crafting saddles both require trusting your work will, er, hold when everything else falls apart.
3. [protective] You were, um, always too much like your father, chasing, [bitter], the sky when the earth had everything you, well, needed right here in this dusty workshop.
4. [tearful] Every saddle I've made since you left has your, [nostalgic], initials hidden in the underside stitching where no one but, [vulnerable], God would ever see them because I couldn't bear to let you, [cracking], go completely. [sighs deeply]
5. The leather remembers everything you know, [wistful], every touch and tear and mend becomes, [philosophical], part of its story just like we carry our, [heavy], breaks and repairs.
6. [proud] My customers always say my saddles have a certain, [emotional], quality that makes their horses trust them more and now I, [understanding], know it's because I've been stitching my love for you into, [tender], every single piece. [long pause]
7. [careful] Well, um, I suppose there's room in this workshop for, [hopeful], both of us if you want to, er, learn how flying and saddling might be, well, different verses of the same song. [sniffles]
8. [warm] Your grandfather's tools are still hanging exactly where he, [melancholic], left them forty years ago waiting for someone who understands that, [wise], leather and sky both demand respect for the space between, [peaceful], control and surrender.
9. Well, um, I saved every newspaper clipping about your flights even though reading them, [pained], felt like watching you fly further away, er, from me each time.
10. [whispered] Um, well, welcome home.
11. [steady] You were twelve.
12. Your father made his choice and I made mine, [resolute], both out of love for you.
13. Listen, um, the hardest part wasn't the time I served, it was, well, watching you grow up through photographs. [sighs]
14. You were protecting your mother who, um, would have lost everything, and I mean everything, including her, [gentle], will to live.
15. [shocked] I didn't, um, know that—they never told me she, [devastated], passed and your letters never, well, mentioned how, I mean, [trailing off], oh God. [long pause]
16. Your father promised me he'd, um, take care of both of you if I, well, kept quiet about the government contracts, [disgusted], the bribes.
17. You're not him—um, you never were, and I mean, that's why I could do this, [proud], watch you become someone good.
18. No, I mean, keep it. [firm]
19. Then we both walk out of our prisons, [warm], tomorrow and start clean because twenty years is, [emotional], enough punishment for everyone.
20. [tearful] Just like we planned.
21. [defensive] I can explain if you'd just, [hesitantly], listen to me for a second instead of jumping to, [anxious], conclusions about what you think you, [trailing off]...
22. [apologetic] It wasn't stealing. [pause]
23. [very quietly] Well, um, I mean...
24. [regretful] Look, I mean, um, the recordings were just supposed to be, [shaky voice], practice demos at first, but then someone offered me money and I, well, [desperate], needed it for my mom's medical bills, you know? [sigh]
25. Um, because, well, I couldn't.
26. [crying while speaking] I know it was wrong, okay, but, um, you don't understand what it's like to watch your mother, [whispering], suffer while you can't afford her treatments, you know?
27. The money from those recordings is literally keeping her, [trembling], alive right now and I can't just stop. [long pause]
28. [relieved] You would actually consider, [curious], working with me after what I did? [gasp softly]
29. [grateful] Um, I, er, don't know...
30. You're right, um, I mean, completely right, and I want to, [eager], make this work if you're really willing to give me, [overwhelmed], another chance after everything. [cry]
31. Whatever you're about to ask me at grandma's birthday, [confused], probably isn't something I should be, [stern], hearing if you're this worked up about it. [pause]
32. That was three years ago and you're still, [exhausted], bringing this up at every single family gathering we have.
33. Are you seriously asking me to tank someone's search results, [angry], right here next to the potato salad?
34. This conversation needs to stop before someone, [worried], overhears what you're suggesting. [cough]
35. [formal] What you're describing could get me blacklisted from, [empathetically], every legitimate SEO network and destroy the reputation I've spent, [slowly], ten years building in this industry.
36. Family means everything which is, um, exactly why I won't let you, [firmly], drag me into something that could, you know, destroy both our careers. [long pause]
37. [warm] Listen, I mean, I understand you're hurting, but, um, revenge through search manipulation isn't going to heal what Marcus did.
38. Build something better than what you had before and let, [confidently], your success be the thing that shows up in, [passionately], search results instead of manufactured negativity.
39. The best revenge is living well and ranking higher, [playful], organically through actual accomplishments rather than, [gently], dirty tricks that would make us no better than him. [chuckle]
40. [relieved] Look, um, if you want, I can teach you legitimate SEO strategies to, [friendly], build your new venture properly so that, you know, when people search for your industry, well, they find you first.
41. [entitled] My followers have a right to know where I am and what I'm, [frustrated], eating because that's literally how I make my, [loudly], six-figure monthly income.
42. [sarcastic] Oh please, like they're going to find me among my, [dismissive], twelve million followers who track my every move, [rolling eyes], anyway.
43. [defensive] Look, my brand is about authenticity and transparency so I can't just, [upset], disappear without explanation when my engagement metrics are, [quickly], peaking from all this drama coverage. [sigh]
44. My manager says, um, this whole witness thing could be, [excited], great content if we spin it right, like, [confidently], maybe a documentary series or something, you know? [laugh]
45. [overly polite] I'm simply trying to maintain my livelihood while cooperating with your, [condescending], little investigation here, Marshal, which frankly seems, [mocking], overblown considering nothing has actually happened to me yet. [groan]
46. [shocked] Wait, what?
47. You can't just threaten to abandon me when I'm apparently in, [terrified], mortal danger according to you people who keep, [crying while speaking], showing me photos of crime scenes that look like horror movies!
48. [apologetic] Look, um, I know I've been difficult but, like, this is literally my entire identity we're talking about and, well, [hesitantly], I don't know who I am without the camera, you know?
49. Maybe you're right about the posting but I need, [regretful], something to hold onto when my whole world is, [very meekly], falling apart like this. [sniffle]
50. I guess, um, being dead would probably hurt my engagement rates more than, well, [bitter laugh], going dark for a few days while you guys, like, [resigned], do whatever it is you do, right? [deep sigh]
51. [confused] That's an odd thing to notice about someone, [curious], but I've been working here for five years now.
52. [anxious] Wait, how do you know about that, because my, [stern], father taught me that specific technique when I was little on our, [trembling], farm before everything fell apart. [sigh]
53. [shocked] Dad? No, you can't be— Mom said you, [angry], died in that accident five years ago when the farm went into, [bitter], foreclosure after the drought destroyed everything. [gasp]
54. Um, you just, uh, disappeared.
55. [empathetically] We never wanted you to be perfect, [tearfully], just present in our lives.
56. [passionately] You think I care about money when I spent five years believing my, [upset], father was dead while Mom cried herself to sleep wondering if she could have, [loudly], saved you somehow?
57. [whispering loudly] Every single day.
58. [excited] Well, um, you're here now and that's what, [cheerful], matters because we can start rebuilding what we lost. [laugh]
59. Er, those hands still know how to tell when fruit is perfectly ripe, and um, that's the father I remember who taught me everything about, [very sincerely], growing things from nothing which is exactly what we'll do with our, [hopeful], family.
60. [confident] Come home with me after my shift because Mom's making that, [playful], vegetable soup you loved and there's always been an empty chair that we've been, [whispering], saving for you. [long pause]
61. [calmly] That's quite an accusation.
62. [condescending] Perhaps your colleagues are simply mistaken about who they, [slowly], saw speaking at those events.
63. Well, um, having a similar face doesn't mean I'm, [defensive], impersonating you, I mean, that's quite a leap.
64. So, um, what if hypothetically someone needed the money and, well, [regretful], happened to look exactly like a prominent analyst, and, you know, [trailing off], certain opportunities presented themselves that were hard to refuse.
65. [apologetic] Look, um, I never intended for things to escalate, er, [nervous], this far with the impersonation thing, you know.
66. [quickly] Well, um, the people who hired me said it was just, [desperate], presenting alternative viewpoints, you know, for balance.
67. [monotone] The money was supposed to help me get out of, [whispering loudly], debt before anyone noticed.
68. I mean, um, what exactly do you want from me now that, [defeated], everything's already ruined anyway, you know. [long pause]
69. You know, um, these aren't the kind of people who, [frightened], let witnesses testify, and, well, [very melancholic], we both have the same face they'll be looking for.
70. I suppose having an identical face means we're, [resigned], in this nightmare together now.
