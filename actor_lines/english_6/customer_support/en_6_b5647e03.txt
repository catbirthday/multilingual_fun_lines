=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I need to... so basically I have to transfer my account to someone else.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely. Let me. Pull that up. Account number ending in 4782. What we're looking at here is... are you transferring to family member?

Customer: Sort of, I mean—it's my ex-husband actually.

Customer Support: Got it got it. Okay so. For account transfers. We need form TR-9042. Takes about 48 hours. Once processed. Both parties get confirmation at their registered emails.

Customer: I just... I can't really deal with forms right now, you know?

Customer Support: Mmm I hear you. Really do. Look what if I—actually wait. Let me walk you through this. Step by step. Make it simple as possible.

Customer: I think maybe I'm doing this wrong, I probably should've called earlier.

Customer Support: No no. You're fine. Honestly. So first thing. Need the new owner's email. That's it for now. Everything else we can...

Customer: It's, um... wait, let me find it... I had it somewhere...

Customer Support: Take your time. While you're looking. Quick note. There's a $15 transfer fee. Code CARE20 brings it to $12. Want me to apply that?

Customer: Yeah that's—sorry, I'm being so scattered, his email is mark.stevens at gmail.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect. Mark Stevens. Gmail. Got it. Now. Security question time. Mother's maiden name on file?

Customer: Thompson. Or wait—no that's... sorry, it's Miller.

Customer Support: Miller. Yep that matches. Account 7782-BK-4782. Shows active since 2019. Balance of $127.43. All getting transferred?

Customer: I guess? I mean probably. I don't even know what's on there honestly.

Customer Support: Hmm let's see. Three subscriptions. Monthly storage at $9.99. Premium features $14.99. Annual backup $47 due next month. Should I list them all...

Customer: Oh God, just... whatever, transfer everything, I can't—

Customer Support: Hey hey. Deep breath. Transferring everything now. Reference number TRN-8847-QM2. Mark gets an email. You get confirmation. Clean break. Done.

Customer: Okay. Thanks. Sorry for being such a mess about this.

Customer Support: Please. Don't apologize. Divorce stuff is. Hard. Really hard. Call if you need anything. Even just to check it went through. We're here.
