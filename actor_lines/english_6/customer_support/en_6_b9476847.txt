=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, yeah, I'm calling about—*exhales*—claim denied? For my dog? I'm actually a vet tech myself so, uh, this is pretty ironic.

Customer Support: Oh, I see. Let me pull up your account... *inhales* okay, what's your policy number? Should start with PET and then some numbers.

Customer: Right, it's um, PET-7792-BK. Real quick—er, I know you're just doing your job here.

Customer Support: Thank you for that. I really appreciate it... So I'm looking at claim CLM-9982741-X here. For a torn ACL surgery? *exhales* And it shows... denied on November 3rd. Due to pre-existing condition classification.

Customer: Yeah but—*sharp inhale*—that's not right! Um, we just got him. Six months ago. No prior issues.

Customer Support: Right, I understand. So here's what I'm seeing... The denial code is E47-PRE. Which means. *sighs* They flagged something in his initial exam. From when you first enrolled him on May 15th?

Customer: But that was just—uh, routine stuff! Normal exam! I did it myself actually, er, at my clinic.

Customer Support: Hmm, okay so... Actually, wait. You said you're a vet tech? *inhales* That's interesting because... Let me check something else here. Sometimes when the policyholder works in veterinary services... The system flags things differently.

Customer: *exhales hard* Oh great. So um, being a vet tech hurts my case? That's—wow. Really appreciate that, guys.

Customer Support: No no, actually it might help... See, there's a form. VET-PROF-22A. For veterinary professionals disputing denials? Most people don't know about this. You'd need to submit it within 30 days though...

Customer: Wait really? Um, that's—thank you! Seriously! Er, how do I get that form?

Customer Support: So I can email it right now. To the address on file? *exhales* And between you and me... The system is ridiculous sometimes. A vet tech can't get coverage for their own dog? Come on.

Customer: *laughs* Right? Uh, yes please, email's perfect. God, thank you so much for this.

Customer Support: Sending now... Should arrive in about 5 minutes. Reference number REF-445821-VPA. And honestly? When you submit it... Mention your AVMA certification number. That usually helps.

Customer: Oh smart, yeah. Um, you're being incredibly helpful here. Like, er, really above and beyond.

Customer Support: Just doing what I can... *sighs* The form needs documentation though. Your original exam notes from May 15th? And any x-rays from before August 20th. If you have those...

Customer: Have them all! Digital files! Uh, perks of working at the clinic, right? *nervous laugh*

Customer Support: Perfect. So submit everything together... Use tracking code TRK-VET-903. And look. I've seen these approved in like 72 hours. When professionals submit them properly? The review team takes them seriously.

Customer: *exhales* Honestly? You just—um, saved my day. My week. Er, probably my bank account too.

Customer Support: Hey, I get it. Our pets are family... And the fact that someone who saves animals for a living. Can't get coverage for their own dog? *sighs* That's just wrong. Call back if you need anything. Ask for extension 4412. That's my direct line.
