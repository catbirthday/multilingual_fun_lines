Scenario: A gaffer working on a film shoot discovers the candy store location is where their estranged father has been working after losing everything in a bankruptcy three years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] We're almost done with the lighting setup for tomorrow's shoot, just need to check the power distribution one more time before— [pause] wait, is that you standing behind the counter?

Character 2: [quietly] Hello, Jamie. [clearing throat] Wasn't expecting to see you here, thought the film crew was coming tomorrow morning for the actual shoot, not today.

Character 1: [bitter] Three years, Dad. Three years of nothing, and now you're working at a candy store five miles from where we used to live?

Character 2: [defensively] It's honest work, pays the bills, keeps me busy during the days when I'm not thinking about everything I lost in the bankruptcy. [sighs] Everything we lost.

Character 1: [frustrated] You mean everything you gambled away? [shaky voice] Mom told me about the second mortgage, the retirement funds, even my college savings that grandma left me.

Character 2: [regretful] Your mother was right to leave, to take you away from all that mess I created trying to save the business. [very quietly] I don't blame either of you for cutting contact.

Character 1: [angrily] Do you have any idea what it was like explaining to my friends why we moved? Why suddenly I couldn't afford film school and had to learn everything on sets instead?

Character 2: [sadly] But you made it anyway, look at you now, working on real productions, doing what you always dreamed about. [pause] I've been following your credits online, saw you worked on that Netflix series.

Character 1: [upset] You've been watching my career? [loudly] After disappearing completely, after not even calling when Mom got sick last year, you've been cyber-stalking my IMDB page?

Character 2: She was sick?

Character 1: [very quietly] Pneumonia, spent two weeks in the hospital, almost needed a ventilator at one point. [bitter] Would've been nice to have someone else there besides just me.

Character 2: [shaky voice] I didn't know, Jamie, I swear I didn't know she was sick or I would've— [exhales] I would've at least tried to call.

Character 1: You could've tried anyway, Dad, any day in the last three years you could've picked up the phone and tried.

Character 2: [very melancholic] Every morning I wake up and tell myself today's the day I'll call, but then I think about what I'd even say. [quietly] How do you apologize for destroying your family's entire future?

Character 1: [exhausted] You start by saying you're sorry, and then you show up, consistently, even when it's hard, even when we don't want to see you. [sighs] That's what parents are supposed to do.

Character 2: [hesitantly] If I gave you my new number, would you actually use it? [pause] Or would it just sit in your phone like another reminder of everything that went wrong?

Character 1: [firmly] I don't know, honestly, but Mom deserves to know you're okay, that you're working, that you're [exhales] trying to put things back together somehow.

Character 2: [warmly] You grew up good, Jamie, despite everything I put you through. [clearing throat] Your mother did an amazing job raising you after I fell apart completely.

Character 1: [quietly] We finish shooting here tomorrow at four. [long pause] Maybe we could talk more after, when I'm not on the clock and you're not surrounded by gummy bears.

Character 2: [relieved] I'll be here, same as every day for the past eighteen months. [very sincerely] Thank you for not just walking out when you saw me, I wouldn't have blamed you.
