Subject: Your nursing patient's child learning to walk again after everyone said the brain injury was too severe

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Look at her. Just look at her. [gasp softly] She's—she's actually doing it. [crying while speaking] Three months ago they told us to prepare for the worst. Said the damage was too extensive, that we should be realistic about our expectations. [bitter] Realistic. [sniffle] And now she's... she's taking steps. Real steps. Not just the reflex movements, but actual, deliberate— [very quietly] Oh my god, she just smiled at me. [laugh] Did you see that? [extremely happy] She knows she's doing it! She knows! [pause] I keep thinking about all those meetings where they showed us the scans, pointed at the dark spots. [mocking] "Significant trauma to the motor cortex," they said. [passionate] But they didn't know her. They didn't know how stubborn she is, how she's always been the kid who, um... who never gave up on anything. [warm] Remember when she was learning to ride a bike? [chuckle] Fell off seventeen times in one afternoon and still wouldn't let me help. [very sincerely] And here she is again, proving everyone wrong. [gasp loudly] Wait, is she—she's coming toward me! [crying while speaking] Come on baby, you've got this. One more step. [whispering] That's my girl.
