Subject: Successfully completing the most challenging project of your career on the day your company announces layoffs

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I just hit submit. Three years of my life, every weekend, every late night—done. [excited] God, I can't believe it's actually finished! The whole predictive modeling system, running perfectly, saving the company millions in— [pause] Wait, what? They're doing what? [confused] Layoffs? Today? Are you serious? They're announcing layoffs today? 

[bitter] Of course they are. Of course. I just delivered the biggest win of my career and they're... how many people? Twenty percent of the workforce? [laugh] This is unbelievable. I mean, I literally just automated half of operations with this thing. That's what they wanted, right? Maximum efficiency? 

[anxious] Oh god. Oh god, what if I just... what if I just built my own replacement? [very quietly] They don't need me anymore now that it's done. The system runs itself. That was the whole point. [sigh]

[slowly] You know what the worst part is? I was so proud of this. Like, genuinely proud. This morning I was thinking about putting it on my resume as my crowning achievement. [bitter] Now it might be the reason I need to update that resume. 

They scheduled the all-hands for 2 PM. Everyone's just walking around like, um... like ghosts. Nobody's celebrating my project launch. Nobody cares. [trailing off] Three years of work and it doesn't even matter because we might not even be here tomorrow...
