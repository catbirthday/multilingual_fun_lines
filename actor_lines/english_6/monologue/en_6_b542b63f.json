Had this beautiful baby girl, and they came in looking for, um... just basic coverage, right? [empathetically] And I could tell they were stretching every penny. The husband kept doing this thing where he'd, uh, check his phone calculator while we talked. [pause] So I'm going through options and I mention the supplemental disability coverage and they're like \"Oh no, we can't afford that.\" But something just... I don't know, something told me to push a little. [passionately] Not for commission—I mean, it was literally twenty bucks more a month—but because they had this baby, you know? [sigh] Six months later, he gets diagnosed with MS. [very quietly] Multiple sclerosis at twenty-six. Can you imagine? [relieved] But that policy we added? It covered everything. The treatments, the lost income when he couldn't work, the specialized equipment. His wife called me crying—well, we were both crying honestly—saying without that coverage they would've lost their house, gone completely under. [very sincerely] That's when I knew, like really knew, why I do this job. It's not about selling policies. It's about... mmm, catching people before they fall, I guess."
