[laugh] The fraud charges, the embezzlement, that whole charity scam he was running? I called it two years ago. And nobody believed me. [pause] They all thought I was jealous, or petty, or just trying to start drama. Sarah actually said I was \"obsessed\" with bringing him down. [sigh] Well, guess who's in federal custody now? Not me. [long pause] But they're all gone. Every last one of them. Sarah won't return my texts. Jake blocked me on everything. Even Amy, who I've known since, um... since we were twelve, she just disappeared. [very sad] They don't care that I was trying to protect them. All they remember is how I wouldn't shut up about it, how I kept pushing and pushing until I— [trailing off] I mean, I had to prove it, right? I couldn't just let him keep fooling everyone. [shaky voice] But now I'm sitting here with all this vindication and nobody to share it with. Was being right really worth losing everybody? [very quietly] I don't know anymore."
