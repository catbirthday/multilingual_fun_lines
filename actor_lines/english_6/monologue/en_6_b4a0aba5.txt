=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Oh my God, they're actually doing it. [excited] The whole company is switching to my system! [pause] I keep refreshing the email because, honestly, I can't believe they said yes. [laughs] Six months ago, everyone thought I was being, um... overly ambitious? [bitter] "That'll never work company-wide," they said. [mocking] "Too complicated for the sales team." [sigh] But look, I knew—I mean, I hoped—that if they just tried it... [hopeful] And now Janet from accounting sent me this message saying it's saving her three hours a day! [extremely happy] Three hours! [gasp softly] The CEO literally used the word "revolutionary" in the announcement. [very quietly] Revolutionary. My thing. [chuckle] I should probably feel more, uh, I don't know, humble about this? [hesitantly] But honestly? [confidently] I worked my ass off on this. [passionately] All those late nights, all that pushback, and now... [pause] everyone's workflow is actually better. [warm] Mike from IT just stopped by to shake my hand. [laughs] Mike! Who never talks to anyone! [delighted] This is... wow. [very sincerely] This is everything I wanted it to be.
