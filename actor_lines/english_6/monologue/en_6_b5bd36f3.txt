Subject: Your cart attendant observations helping security prevent a serious accident

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] You know how everyone thinks cart attendants just push carts around all day? Well, yesterday I'm out there collecting them from the far corner of the lot, and I notice this guy. [confused] He's just sitting in his truck, engine running, but something's... off. His head keeps dropping forward. [concerned] At first I thought maybe he's checking his phone, but no, it's like he's nodding off completely. [speeding up] And his truck is in drive—I can see the brake lights flickering on and off every time his foot relaxes. There's a whole family walking right in front of him with their kids. [shaky voice] So I radio security immediately, tell them we might have a medical situation. [pause] They get there just as his foot comes completely off the brake. [gasp softly] The truck starts rolling forward. Security blocks it with their vehicle, gets to him just in time. [relieved] Turns out he was having a diabetic episode, blood sugar crashed. [very quietly] If I hadn't been out there, if I'd been on break or something... [trailing off] Those kids were right there. [long pause] [warm] The manager said I probably saved lives yesterday. Me. The cart guy. [chuckle] I mean, I'm still just pushing carts today, but it's, um... it feels different somehow. [sincerely] Like maybe every job matters more than we think.
