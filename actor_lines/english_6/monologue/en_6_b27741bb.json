[pause] God, when I saw his face in that courtroom today, it was like looking in a mirror from five years ago. That same disbelief, that same... I don't know, like you're waiting for someone to say it's a mistake. [very slowly] But it's real. [happy] He gets to go home tonight. To his kids. [sniffle] \n\nWhen they took seven years from me, I promised myself I'd use whatever time I had left to make sure this didn't happen to anyone else. [passionately] But starting the clinic was one thing—actually winning? [exhale] I mean, we knew Marcus was innocent. The evidence was there. But I also know that sometimes that's not enough. [bitter] Trust me, I know that better than anyone. [pause]\n\n[warm] The team worked so hard on this. Sarah stayed up three nights straight going through those surveillance tapes. [chuckle] And now we have our first victory. Our first person coming home. [very excited] This is just the beginning though. There are so many more Marcus's out there. [confidently] And we're going to find them."
