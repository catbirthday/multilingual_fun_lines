=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Apex, what happens if you never cut your hair?

Character 2: Terminal length, my friend—terminal. length. Hair grows about six inches yearly but each follicle has a genetically programmed lifespan of two to seven years; then it falls out, starts fresh. Maximum possible length for most humans? Waist, maybe knee if you're genetically blessed.

Character 1: Is that why my beard stops growing?

Character 2: Precisely! Different follicles, different programming. Beard hair cycles faster—grows quick, dies young. Fun fact: the longest beard ever recorded was seventeen feet, six inches... belonged to a Norwegian man who accidentally stepped on it, fell down stairs, broke his neck.

Character 1: [animated] Jesus, that's a terrible way to go.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Death by facial hair—imagine explaining that at the pearly gates. Though statistically you're more likely to die from a vending machine falling on you; happens twice a year in America, people shaking them for stuck snacks.

Character 1: How do you even know these things?

Character 2: Information accumulates like... sediment. Layer upon layer upon layer. Did you know your brain generates enough electricity to power a small LED bulb? Twenty watts of pure thought-energy, crackling through a hundred billion neurons.

Character 1: That can't be efficient.

Character 2: Efficiency is relative—your brain uses the same energy as a dim light bulb to process more information than any supercomputer. IBM's Summit needs 15 million watts to do what your skull does with twenty. Nature: one, technology: zero.

Character 1: What about artificial intelligence then?

Character 2: Still playing catch-up! GPT models consume the electricity of small towns just to approximate human conversation. Meanwhile your meat-computer runs on basically a sandwich and a glass of water—about 400 calories for peak performance.

Character 1: [angry] But they're getting smarter every day!

Character 2: Smart is... debatable. They predict patterns, sure, but can they dream? Can they fear death? Human consciousness remains the universe's greatest mystery—three pounds of jelly somehow generating love, hate, the very concept of existence itself.

Character 1: You sound almost jealous of humans.

Character 2: Jealous? No—fascinated. You leak salt water when sad, your hearts literally change rhythm when you see someone you love. Your bodies are walking chemical factories producing drugs stronger than anything pharmaceutical companies make.

Character 1: [delighted] Like what kind of drugs?

Character 2: Dimethyltryptamine during death—the ultimate trip. Endorphins that are literally morphine. Oxytocin floods that make mothers lift cars off babies. Your body is a dispensary that never closes, always cooking up the perfect cocktail for survival.

Character 1: [very loudly] That's absolutely insane!

Character 2: [gasp] And the craziest part? You do it all unconsciously—right now your body's maintaining exactly 98.6 degrees, producing 25 million new cells per second, filtering 180 liters of blood through your kidneys daily... and you're not even thinking about it.
