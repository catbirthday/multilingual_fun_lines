=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Doctor Chen, I've been thinking about getting my nose done for years.

Character 2: Oh, okay, yeah that's—that's actually really common, you know? Most of my patients have been considering it for, gosh, sometimes a decade before they finally come in. What specifically about your nose bothers you, if you don't mind me asking?

Character 1: It's too big, obviously. Everyone notices it.

Character 2: [formal] Well, I have to respectfully disagree with "obviously"—I'm looking at your profile right now and, honestly, your nose is quite proportional to your other features. But look, perception is everything, and if it's affecting your confidence, that's what matters here, not what I or anyone else thinks.

Character 1: You're just saying that to be nice.

Character 2: No no, I promise I'm not—I mean, being nice is part of bedside manner, sure, but I've turned away plenty of patients who didn't need surgery. Your nose has maybe a slight dorsal hump which, um, we could definitely address if that's what's bothering you, but it's really not as prominent as you might think.

Character 1: [exhausted] How much would it even cost?

Character 2: Mmm, so rhinoplasty typically runs between eight and fifteen thousand, depending on complexity and whether we're doing, like, functional stuff too—fixing breathing issues, that kind of thing. Insurance sometimes covers the functional part which, uh, can help offset costs a bit.

Character 1: That's insane. I could buy a car.

Character 2: Ha, yeah, you absolutely could buy a car—a pretty decent one too. Look, I always tell people, if you're having any doubts about the cost versus benefit, then honestly, wait. This isn't emergency surgery, there's no rush here, and frankly, debt stress cancels out any confidence boost you'd get from the procedure.

Character 1: But you make money doing these, so of course you want me to do it.

Character 2: [shy] Actually, um, that's... that's kind of the opposite of how I operate? Like, my reputation depends entirely on happy outcomes, not volume, so I'd rather have you walk away than regret spending money on something you're not, you know, completely certain about.

Character 1: [slowly] What if it turns out badly?

Character 2: Okay so, realistically? About five to ten percent of rhinoplasties need some kind of revision, which sounds scary but most of those are, like, tiny adjustments—a little more off here, slightly different angle there. Major complications are genuinely rare, maybe one in two hundred cases, and even then we can usually fix things.

Character 1: Have you ever really messed someone up?

Character 2: [curious] That's... huh, that's actually a fair question that most people are too polite to ask. I had one case about three years ago where the patient developed unexpected scar tissue that, erm, created some asymmetry, but we corrected it with a revision six months later and she's thrilled now.

Character 1: What about Michael Jackson situations?

Character 2: Ohh boy, yeah, that's—that's actually what we call body dysmorphia combined with, frankly, some unethical surgeons who kept operating when they should've said no. Any decent surgeon would recognize those warning signs and refer for psychological evaluation instead of just, you know, taking the money and carving away.

Character 1: [mocking] So you're also a therapist now?

Character 2: Ha, I mean, kind of? Not officially, but honestly, probably sixty percent of my job is listening to people's insecurities and helping them figure out if surgery will actually address what's really bothering them, or if they're trying to fix something internal with something external, which... well, that never works out the way people hope.
