Character 1: What's the most expensive liquid on Earth?

Character 2: Scorpion venom, believe it or not. It costs around 39 million dollars per gallon. They use it for medical research, particularly for treating arthritis and certain cancers.

Character 1: Wait, how do they even milk a scorpion?

Character 2: [quickly] Electrical stimulation mostly. You apply a mild shock to the tail and it releases venom droplets. Each scorpion produces maybe two milligrams at most, which is why it's so insanely expensive.

Character 1: [slowly] That seems... unnecessarily dangerous.

Character 2: It's actually pretty controlled. The real danger is in the wild where they kill about 3,000 people yearly. Most deaths happen in rural areas without access to antivenom.

Character 1: [regretful] I used to keep one as a pet in college.

Character 2: Emperor scorpion? Those are the gentle giants of the scorpion world. Their venom is basically like a bee sting unless you're allergic.

Character 1: Yeah, exactly. Named him Steve.

Character 2: Classic choice. They're fascinating creatures—they glow under UV light because of proteins in their exoskeleton. Nobody knows exactly why they evolved that trait.

Character 1: Speaking of weird evolution, why do we have appendixes?

Character 2: Current theory is it's a safe house for good bacteria. When you get sick and your gut gets wiped clean, the appendix repopulates your intestines with the beneficial microbes.

Character 1: [clearing throat] Mine got removed when I was twelve.

Character 2: You're not missing much. About 1 in 20 people get appendicitis at some point. The surgery is so routine now that it's safer to remove than to leave in once it's inflamed.

Character 1: What organ could we definitely not live without?

Character 2: [very slowly] Your liver. It does over 500 different jobs in your body. You can lose a kidney, your spleen, even parts of your brain, but lose your liver and you've got maybe days.

Character 1: [joking] Good thing mine's gotten so much practice then.

Character 2: [cheerful] The liver's actually incredible at regeneration! You can lose 75% of it and it'll grow back to full size within weeks. It's the only organ that can do that.

Character 1: [very quickly] No way that's true.

Character 2: Completely true. Greek mythology even got it right with Prometheus—eagle eats his liver daily, it grows back overnight. Ancient Greeks somehow knew about hepatic regeneration thousands of years before modern medicine figured it out.
