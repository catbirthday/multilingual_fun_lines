=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: This was supposed to be relaxing, you know? I can't believe we're already lost.

Character 2: Oh jeez, we're not lost, we're just... temporarily unsure of our exact location. The river only goes one way, so technically we can't be that lost, right?

Character 1: My arms are killing me. How much further do you think?

Character 2: Umm, based on when we started, probably another hour? Maybe hour and a half? Though honestly, I wasn't really paying attention to the time when we launched, so that's kind of a guess.

Character 1: An hour and a half? Are you serious right now?

Character 2: Look, I mean, kayaking is supposed to be about the journey, not the destination. Plus the scenery is gorgeous—those cliffs, the eagles we saw earlier, that's pretty special stuff.

Character 1: The eagles were cool, I'll give you that. But my sunscreen washed off ages ago.

Character 2: Eesh, yeah, that's not good. I've got some waterproof SPF 50 in my dry bag if you want it. Though, um, applying it while paddling might be a bit of a challenge.

Character 1: Everything hurts. My back, my shoulders, even my fingers somehow.

Character 2: That's actually pretty normal for first-timers—you're using muscles you don't normally use. Tomorrow's gonna be rough, I'm not gonna lie. Ice and ibuprofen will be your best friends.

Character 1: Why didn't you tell me it would be this hard?

Character 2: [very quietly] Because, honestly, if I'd told you everything—the soreness, the sun exposure, the possibility of tipping—you never would've come, and I really wanted someone to go with.

Character 1: That's manipulative. I trusted you when you said it would be fun.

Character 2: Okay so, yeah, I may have downplayed the physical demands a little bit, but come on, we're making memories here! Years from now you'll laugh about this.

Character 1: I'm never doing this again. My phone's dead, we're lost, and I'm starving.

Character 2: Hmm, well, there's a cooler full of sandwiches waiting at the takeout point, assuming we ever find it. And hey, being disconnected from technology for a few hours isn't the worst thing.

Character 1: A few hours? You said this would take two hours total!

Character 2: Uhhh, I said two hours of paddling time, which, admittedly, doesn't include breaks, getting lost, or, um, that twenty minutes we spent untangling from those branches.

Character 1: I can't believe I let you talk me into this disaster.

Character 2: [condescending] Oh please, you're being so dramatic about this. It's a little kayak trip, not some survival expedition—millions of people do this for fun every weekend without whining constantly.
