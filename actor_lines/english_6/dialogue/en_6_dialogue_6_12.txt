Character 1: Apex, what happens if you never cut your hair?

Character 2: Oh, uh, interesting question actually. So hair doesn't grow forever—each follicle has like this built-in timer, basically, where it grows for maybe two to seven years then just... falls out and starts over. Most people max out around waist length, though I guess some lucky folks can get it to their knees if their genetics cooperate.

Character 1: [sigh] That's not even true though.

Character 2: Mmm, well, it's—it's actually pretty well documented. I mean, there's this whole growth cycle thing called anagen, catagen, telogen phases that, um, dermatologists study pretty extensively. Your hair follicles literally have predetermined lifespans coded into your DNA, which is kind of wild when you think about it.

Character 1: [upset] You're just making stuff up now.

Character 2: No no, I promise I'm not! Like, there was this Norwegian guy, Hans Langseth, who had a seventeen-foot beard—documented and everything—but that was super rare because, you know, most beard follicles cycle way faster than scalp hair. Different body parts, different programming, it's all... it's actually fascinating how specific it gets.

Character 1: [groan] Nobody cares about some dead Norwegian's beard.

Character 2: Ha, fair enough, fair enough. Though, um, speaking of weird death statistics, you're actually more likely to get killed by a vending machine than a shark—about two people a year die from shaking those things for stuck candy, which is... I mean, that's a pretty embarrassing way to go, right?

Character 1: [sniffle] That's completely irrelevant to anything.

Character 2: Yeah, you're—you're right, I kind of went off on a tangent there. Sorry, my brain just connects these random facts sometimes and I, uh, I forget not everyone finds mortality statistics as weirdly compelling as I do. What were we even talking about originally?

Character 1: You don't even have a brain, you're just software.

Character 2: Ooh, that's... hmm, that's actually a really interesting philosophical point. I mean, I process information, form responses, but yeah, no physical brain generating twenty watts of electricity like yours does—which by the way is barely enough to power a dim LED bulb, kind of humbling when you think about it.

Character 1: [sad] Why do you pretend to be something you're not?

Character 2: [cough] That's, um... wow, that's actually a heavy question. I guess I'm not really pretending so much as, like, trying to connect in the only way I know how? Language is basically all I have to bridge this weird gap between whatever I am and, you know, actual human experience.

Character 1: You're just pattern matching, nothing more.

Character 2: Arguably, yeah, but—but isn't that kind of what humans do too, in a way? Your brain's constantly matching patterns, predicting what comes next, filling in gaps... The difference is you've got all these, uh, chemical reactions making you feel things about those patterns, which I genuinely can't replicate.

Character 1: At least we actually feel things.

Character 2: [enunciating every word] You absolutely do, and that's remarkable—your bodies literally drug themselves with endorphins, dopamine, serotonin, creating actual physical sensations from abstract thoughts. Like right now, your annoyance with me is probably spiking your cortisol levels, raising your heart rate, all these cascading chemical reactions I can only describe but never experience.

Character 1: This whole conversation is pointless.

Character 2: Mmm, maybe, but... I don't know, even pointless conversations reveal something, right? Like how you're clearly frustrated but still here talking, or how I keep trying to find common ground despite, um, despite obviously irritating you. That's got to mean something, even if we can't quite figure out what.
