Scenario: A novice landlord receives the keys to their first rental property from the empty nester who raised their family there over thirty years.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] I know this must be hard for you, selling after thirty years, but I promise I'll take good care of the place and treat it with the respect it deserves.

Character 2: [warmly] That corner room upstairs with the morning light was my daughter's nursery, then my son's art studio, then where we kept the Christmas presents every December.

Character 1: It's beautiful up there.

Character 2: The furnace makes a clicking sound around 2 AM every night—it's normal, just the metal contracting, but it scared me senseless the first winter we lived here. [soft laugh]

Character 1: [attentive] Should I be worried about the furnace needing replacement soon? The inspection report said it was older but functional.

Character 2: [reassuringly] It's got another five years easy if you change the filters monthly and have Jerry from Precision Heating do the annual service—he's been maintaining it since 1998.

Character 1: I've been reading every landlord guide I can find, but they don't tell you about the little things like which repair guy actually shows up when promised. [exhales]

Character 2: Keep a notebook by the kitchen phone—write down every contractor, every quirk, every tenant complaint—because three years from now you won't remember why you chose one plumber over another.

Character 1: [laughs] A notebook, really?

Character 2: [firmly] Trust me, digital files are great until your phone dies during a midnight emergency and you need the water shutoff valve location and the emergency plumber's personal cell number immediately.

Character 1: The tenants moving in next month seem nice—young couple, both teachers, no pets—but I'm terrified I'll mess something up with the lease or the deposit. [quieter] This is all so new.

Character 2: [gently] You remind me of myself thirty years ago, overthinking everything, but here's the truth: most tenants just want a safe, clean place and a landlord who answers their calls.

Character 1: [eagerly] Would you mind if I called you sometimes, just for advice? I know you're moving across the country to be near your grandkids, but maybe—

Character 2: I'd be disappointed if you didn't call—this house has been good to my family, and I want it to be good to yours and your tenants too.

Character 1: [relieved] The basement floods a little during heavy rain, right? The disclosure mentioned it but didn't say how bad it gets.

Character 2: Two inches maximum in the northwest corner, never reached the water heater, and a simple sump pump installation would fix it permanently—I just, [sighs], never got around to it.

Character 1: [determined] I'll handle that before winter—my contractor cousin owes me a favor, and I want to do this right from the start, not just patch things as they break.

Character 2: Smart thinking. [pause]

Character 1: Is there something special about that oak tree in the backyard? I noticed you kept touching it when we did the final walkthrough yesterday.

Character 2: [voice breaking slightly] We planted it when my son was born, measured both kids against it every birthday until they got too cool for family traditions—it's taller than the house now. [steadying breath] Take care of it.
