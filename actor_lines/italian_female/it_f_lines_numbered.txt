# Speaker Lines Only (Translated) - Italian (Female)
============================================================

1. [stunned] I've been hearing you for, [trembling], months now in the dead frequencies, those impossible harmonics that, [overwhelmed], shouldn't exist in digital recordings but somehow, [breaking], bleed through every single project. [exhales]
2. [desperate] So you're telling me that every artist who's recorded here has been, [horrified], carrying death songs in their music without knowing it?
3. [defeated] Well, um, that's just, er, perfect.
4. [resigned] Twenty years I've been engineering in this room, perfecting mixes, and now I learn every track was, [bitter], contaminated with prophecies of death.
5. [weary] Look, um, I don't know what you want from me but, [lost], I can't unhear you now in everything I've ever created here, you know?
6. [soft] Um, well, what's, er, coming?
7. So you're saying that everything I've devoted my life to, [crushed], the very essence of sound itself is going to, [hopeless], disappear and there's nothing we can, [breaking], do about it. [laughs bitterly]
8. [curious] Um, I mean, together how exactly?
9. [considering] Well, um, I suppose if I adjusted the frequencies and, [thoughtful], layered your voice with harmonic resonance, we could, er, create something that people might actually, [hopeful], want to hear. [pauses]
10. [accepting] I mean, um, if silence is coming anyway then, [resolved], maybe the last thing I mix should be, well, the most important warning ever recorded, even if it's also, [peaceful], the most beautiful goodbye. [sighs deeply]
11. [bitter] Yeah well, um, I mean, it's hard to run into someone who, [hollow], basically vanished overnight after we spent four years building something that was, uh, supposed to be our future, [cold], our dream together.
12. [resentful] Right, so you traded your guitar for a briefcase and became another, [disgusted], corporate drone in an expensive suit.
13. [hurt] We were so close.
14. [defensive] Well, um, that's not fair.
15. [proud] At least I'm still creating.
16. Um, well, I mean, you could've stayed.
17. [softer] Yeah well, um, the new bassist doesn't have your ear for harmonies and, [wistful], sometimes I still hear your voice in the songs we wrote together, I mean, [vulnerable], the ones I still play every night. [pause]
18. [gentle] Your law firm is three blocks from the venue where we, [reminiscing], played our first real gig together.
19. [hopeful] Well, um, you know, we're playing there again next Friday and, I mean, the mic you used to sing into is still there, [careful], waiting in the same corner where you left it, [tender], like maybe it knows you might come back someday.
20. The band never sounded the same after you left because, [honest], turns out the magic wasn't just in the music but in who was, [emotional], making it with me.
21. [bitter] Of course you don't, [coldly], remember me—I was just employee number forty-seven at MediTech Solutions before you, [sarcastic], decided our entire department wasn't worth keeping around. [pause]
22. Well, um, your sister and her baby are, [relieved], alive because of the skills I learned after you, like, [empathetically], forced me to completely reinvent my career, you know?
23. [warm] Your sister kept asking for you during the, [anxious], hardest parts when we thought we might, [slowly], lose them both. [sigh]
24. [formal] Twenty-seven hours of labor with complications that, [passionately], required every technique I've learned since leaving, [exhausted], tech to pursue actual life-saving work.
25. You know, um, after you eliminated our positions, I spent, like, [angry], six months unable to pay rent before, well, [cheerful], discovering I had a calling for midwifery.
26. [confidently] Every baby I deliver reminds me that some, [playful], things matter more than profit margins. [laugh]
27. [friendly] Well, um, those startups you fund might, [curious], actually help midwives like me someday, you know? [chuckle]
28. [mocking] Rich that you're offering me work now when, [stern], five years ago you couldn't even look at us while, [very excited], security escorted us out with our boxes. [sneeze]
29. [softly] Maybe it wasn't.
30. [overly polite] Well, um, perhaps losing that job was, like, [flirtatious], destiny's way of putting me exactly where, [happy], I needed to be tonight to save your family. [laugh loudly]
