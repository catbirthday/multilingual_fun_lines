Scenario: A mixing engineer working late in an isolated studio begins hearing otherworldly frequencies in her recordings and discovers the studio's resident banshee, whose keening has been bleeding through into every track for decades.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [ethereal] Every track you've mixed here carries my, [mournful], voice beneath the music like fog seeping through closed windows.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I've been hearing you for, [trembling], months now in the dead frequencies, those impossible harmonics that, [overwhelmed], shouldn't exist in digital recordings but somehow, [breaking], bleed through every single project. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [ancient] Well, um, I've been bound to this studio since before it was, [hollow], a studio, you know, when bodies were buried beneath these foundations during the plague.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] So you're telling me that every artist who's recorded here has been, [horrified], carrying death songs in their music without knowing it?

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Um, well, I mean, yes.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Well, um, that's just, er, perfect.

Character 1 [en]: The keening isn't meant to, [sorrowful], harm—it's simply my nature to mourn what's coming, to, [breaking], warn of endings that can't be stopped. [wails softly]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Twenty years I've been engineering in this room, perfecting mixes, and now I learn every track was, [bitter], contaminated with prophecies of death.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Um, I mean, please listen.

Character 2 [en]: [weary] Look, um, I don't know what you want from me but, [lost], I can't unhear you now in everything I've ever created here, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, the thing is, I need someone who, [desperate], understands sound to help me because, er, my keening is getting louder and I can't, [anguished], control it anymore and, like, soon everyone will hear what's coming.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Um, well, what's, er, coming?

Character 1 [en]: [prophetic] I mean, um, there's a silence approaching that will, [terrified], swallow all sound and, well, music will die first, then voices, then even the, [fading], wind itself will go quiet forever, you know?

Character 2 [en]: So you're saying that everything I've devoted my life to, [crushed], the very essence of sound itself is going to, [hopeless], disappear and there's nothing we can, [breaking], do about it. [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Well, um, maybe, er, together though.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Um, I mean, together how exactly?

Character 1 [en]: [urgent] You know, um, if we could somehow mix my keening into something, [determined], beautiful instead of terrifying, like, maybe we could warn people properly.

Character 2 [en]: [considering] Well, um, I suppose if I adjusted the frequencies and, [thoughtful], layered your voice with harmonic resonance, we could, er, create something that people might actually, [hopeful], want to hear. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [embracing] So, um, you'll help me even though, well, working with me means, [sad], accepting that everything ends, that every note we, [tender], record together is part of the world's final, [breaking], song?

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] I mean, um, if silence is coming anyway then, [resolved], maybe the last thing I mix should be, well, the most important warning ever recorded, even if it's also, [peaceful], the most beautiful goodbye. [sighs deeply]
