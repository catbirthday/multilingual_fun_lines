=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Oh my god, um, is that really you or am I just, [disbelieving], hallucinating from too much caffeine because, well, I haven't seen you since the band, [voice cracking], broke up three years ago. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah well, um, I mean, it's hard to run into someone who, [hollow], basically vanished overnight after we spent four years building something that was, uh, supposed to be our future, [cold], our dream together.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I didn't vanish, I just had to be, [desperate], practical about my life when the record label passed on us for the third time and my student loans were, [defeated], drowning me in debt that playing dive bars couldn't, [quieter], even dent. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [resentful] Right, so you traded your guitar for a briefcase and became another, [disgusted], corporate drone in an expensive suit.

Character 1 [en]: It's not like I wanted to give up music but sometimes being an adult means, [ashamed], making choices that keep you from living in your car.

Character 2 [en]: [hurt] We were so close.

Character 1 [en]: Close doesn't pay rent or buy health insurance or help my mom with her medical bills, [frustrated], things you never had to worry about because your parents, [bitter], funded everything. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, that's not fair.

Character 1 [en]: [tired] You still play the same venues we used to dream were beneath us while I draft contracts for companies that, [hollow], destroy the kind of art we swore we'd protect.

Character 2 [en]: [proud] At least I'm still creating.

Character 1 [en]: [broken] God, I miss it.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, I mean, you could've stayed.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Look, um, I know you think I betrayed everything we stood for but, well, watching my dad work himself to death at the factory taught me that, [pragmatic], dreams don't mean anything if you can't survive. [trails off]

Character 2 [en]: [softer] Yeah well, um, the new bassist doesn't have your ear for harmonies and, [wistful], sometimes I still hear your voice in the songs we wrote together, I mean, [vulnerable], the ones I still play every night. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Sometimes I sit in my office at midnight reviewing depositions and I can still feel the calluses on my fingers that, [nostalgic], used to be there from playing until dawn.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Your law firm is three blocks from the venue where we, [reminiscing], played our first real gig together.

Character 1 [en]: [pained] I know, I walk past it every morning and pretend I don't hear the ghost of who I, [regretful], used to be.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Well, um, you know, we're playing there again next Friday and, I mean, the mic you used to sing into is still there, [careful], waiting in the same corner where you left it, [tender], like maybe it knows you might come back someday.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] I have a deposition that night but, um, maybe I could, well, I don't know, [conflicted], maybe some things are worth being impractical for. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: The band never sounded the same after you left because, [honest], turns out the magic wasn't just in the music but in who was, [emotional], making it with me.
