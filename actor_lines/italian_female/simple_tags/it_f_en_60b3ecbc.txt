=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Wait, I, um, know you from somewhere, but I can't, [confused], place exactly where, though you look so, [hesitantly], familiar despite the scrubs and everything, er, happening with my sister.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Of course you don't, [coldly], remember me—I was just employee number forty-seven at MediTech Solutions before you, [sarcastic], decided our entire department wasn't worth keeping around. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Oh my God.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, your sister and her baby are, [relieved], alive because of the skills I learned after you, like, [empathetically], forced me to completely reinvent my career, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] The board pushed those layoffs through so, [shaky voice], quickly and I never got to see the, [very quietly], faces of the people we were letting go.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Your sister kept asking for you during the, [anxious], hardest parts when we thought we might, [slowly], lose them both. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, um, I was in Singapore closing, like, [frustrated], another deal while she was here, [crying while speaking], fighting for her life and, well, you were the one saving her.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Twenty-seven hours of labor with complications that, [passionately], required every technique I've learned since leaving, [exhausted], tech to pursue actual life-saving work.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Um, I know this doesn't fix anything but, er, [sincerely], watching you work tonight showed me what, [trailing off], real value looks like and I... [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, after you eliminated our positions, I spent, like, [angry], six months unable to pay rent before, well, [cheerful], discovering I had a calling for midwifery.

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] My whole life has been about calculating ROI and, [jealous], market valuations while you literally bring new, [whispering loudly], life into the world. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Every baby I deliver reminds me that some, [playful], things matter more than profit margins. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, the irony is that, um, [upset], we invested millions in healthcare startups trying to, [quickly], revolutionize birth outcomes while, er, you're here actually doing it with your hands. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Well, um, those startups you fund might, [curious], actually help midwives like me someday, you know? [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: Um, would you consider, like, [shy], consulting for our healthcare portfolio because clearly, [animated], we need someone who understands the real work, I mean? [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Rich that you're offering me work now when, [stern], five years ago you couldn't even look at us while, [very excited], security escorted us out with our boxes. [sneeze]

Character 1 [en]: [humble] That was the worst, [monotone], decision I've ever been part of. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Maybe it wasn't.

Character 1 [en]: Um, my sister is alive because you became, well, [delighted], a midwife instead of staying in tech, and maybe, [speeding up], that's worth more than any startup exit, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [overly polite] Well, um, perhaps losing that job was, like, [flirtatious], destiny's way of putting me exactly where, [happy], I needed to be tonight to save your family. [laugh loudly]
