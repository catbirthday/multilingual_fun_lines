=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The candles need to be, [trembling], lit in a specific order or the healing circle won't, [desperate], hold long enough for me to reach her spirit before it crosses.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Um, I don't know what you're, [confused], doing here but visiting hours ended and, well, [firm], these open flames are against every safety regulation we have, I mean, [trailing off], especially in room twelve.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Please, um, just give me ten more minutes because, [breaking], she taught me everything I know. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] I've been watching you visit every night for, [curious], three weeks and the way she seems to, [amazed], respond to your presence is unlike anything I've seen in, [whispering], fifteen years of hospice care. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] She can still hear us through the veil that's, [ethereal], growing thinner with each breath she takes, and tonight the, [urgent], moon's position will allow me one last chance to, [determined], ease her crossing.

Character 2 [en]: [mesmerized] The lights in her room keep, [breathless], flickering whenever you speak those strange words.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] They're not strange words but ancient promises made between, [emotional], teacher and student, bonds that death can't break even when, [resolute], modern medicine says there's nothing left to do. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [overwhelmed] Um, I've held so many hands as they've, well, [haunted], crossed over but I've never felt anything like the, [awestruck], energy that's building in this room right now, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [focused] The energy recognizes your gift too because not everyone who, [knowing], works with the dying can actually feel the threshold. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Sometimes I sense where they're going and it's always, [peaceful], somewhere beautiful but with her it's different like she's, [confused], waiting for something specific before she can, [quiet], let go completely.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] She's waiting for me to, [heavy], forgive myself for not being strong enough to heal her. [tears falling]

Character 2 [en]: Even good witches can't cure, [compassionate], everything and maybe that's not weakness but wisdom.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You know what I, um, am then, and you're not, well, [relieved], afraid or calling security or, I mean, [grateful], asking me to leave? [shaky breath]

Character 2 [en]: [calm] I've seen enough unexplained healing in these, [accepting], rooms to know that medicine and magic aren't enemies. [smiles softly]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Would you help me complete the circle because two souls, [intense], guiding her passage will make it gentler than one. [whispered]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Tell me where to place my hands and I'll channel whatever, [brave], light I have through yours into hers because nobody, [fierce], should cross alone when there's love, [emotional], waiting to guide them.

Character 1 [en]: [moved] Um, just hold my hand and, well, think about every peaceful death you've witnessed, [instructing], like you're gathering their courage.

Character 2 [en]: [reverent] I can feel them all suddenly like they're, [amazed], standing with us in this room right now. [gasps softly]

Character 1 [en]: [powerful] The veil is opening and she's reaching through it with, [joyful], such peace on her face that I've never seen before. [crying]

Character 2 [en]: [transcendent] She's saying something about how the student has become the, [tearful], teacher and that your healing gift was never meant for, [understanding], bodies but for souls finding their way, [whispered], home.
