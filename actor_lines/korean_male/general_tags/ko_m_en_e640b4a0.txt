=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I've been, um, sitting here for, [exhausted], six hours waiting for the perfect, [desperate], shot and you just, well, glide into frame like it's, [bitter], nothing at all.

Character 2 [en]: [serene] You humans with your, um, machines always seem to be, [gentle], chasing something that's already right in front of you, I mean, missing the, [thoughtful], actual moment while hunting for the perfect one. [sighs softly]

Character 1 [en]: That's easy for you to, [defensive], say when you're naturally graceful and every movement you make is, [envious], poetry without even trying.

Character 2 [en]: [amused] Grace isn't natural, um, it's earned through, [patient], thousands of awkward landings as a cygnet, you know, falling and flailing before finding balance.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Really?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Oh yes, I mean, I spent my first summer, [chuckling], face-planting into lily pads while my siblings, [nostalgic], laughed, well, but each failure taught me something about, um, movement and patience.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] So you're saying I should, um, embrace the, [hesitant], imperfect shots instead of, well, waiting for something that might never come?

Character 2 [en]: The water never shows the same, [wise], reflection twice yet it's always beautiful in its changing.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] I've been so focused on, um, capturing you that I missed the, [realizing], way the light dances on your feathers, I mean, right now.

Character 2 [en]: Your lens sees what you, [gentle], tell it to see but your eyes, [meaningful], they see what actually is.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Maybe I should, um, put the camera down and just, [vulnerable], watch for once, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] The lake has been here, well, long before your cameras and will, [peaceful], remain long after, um, but this moment between us is, [tender], happening only now. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You know, I came here to, um, document wildlife but somehow you're, [amazed], teaching me about being alive, I mean, really alive.

Character 2 [en]: We swans live, um, maybe twenty years if we're, [melancholic], lucky but we spend each day, [earnest], fully present in the water, not, [philosophical], counting the seasons we have left. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, I think I've been, well, so afraid.

Character 2 [en]: [compassionate] Fear keeps you behind the, [understanding], lens instead of stepping into the frame of your own life, um, doesn't it?

Character 1 [en]: [breaking] I've spent, um, ten years filming other creatures, [choked], living their authentic lives while I hide behind, [raw], technology pretending that observing is the same as, [heavy], experiencing, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [tender] The most beautiful moments I've, um, witnessed here were never, [knowing], captured by any camera—the mist at dawn, [wistful], the last breath of winter becoming spring, the, [poetic], silent conversations between souls who truly see each other.

Character 1 [en]: Will you, um, stay here a little longer while I just, [hopeful], sit and watch the water with you, I mean, no camera, just us?

Character 2 [en]: [peaceful] I'll stay as long as the, [content], moment asks us to.
