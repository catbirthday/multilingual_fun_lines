=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] So, um, I know it's been, [careful], three years since we've talked but, well, I heard you're working on that new, [measured], desert resort irrigation system, I mean, the one near Paradise Valley.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Yeah, well, I didn't expect to hear from you after, [guarded], everything that happened, um, but I mean, [softer], it's actually good timing since I could use someone to talk to about work.

Character 1 [en]: [casual] You know, um, I've been thinking about how, [gentle], we used to explore those old mining tunnels as kids, well, before dad told us to stay away.

Character 2 [en]: [nostalgic] Those tunnels run right under half the valley now, [laughing], most people don't even know they connect to the new water management systems we're, [technical], installing for the casinos. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [interested] Really? That's fascinating.

Character 2 [en]: [warming up] The whole irrigation network has to bypass the old tunnels but we use them for, [enthusiastic], maintenance access since they're already reinforced and, [proud], perfectly positioned for the main lines.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] Must be complicated keeping track of all those, [probing], underground routes and access points.

Character 2 [en]: [relaxed] Actually, the security is pretty minimal down there since nobody really, [shrugging], thinks about water pipes as anything important, just me and my crew with basic keycards and, [chuckling], we know every inch of those passages by now. [yawns]

Character 1 [en]: [yielding] Well, um, I mean, I've been having some trouble lately and, [vulnerable], maybe you could help me understand how someone like you finds, [searching], purpose in something so, you know, steady and honest.

Character 2 [en]: Um, honestly after watching you, [concerned], spiral into whatever it was you got mixed up in, well, I found peace in just, [earnest], making things grow in the desert, you know, creating life where there shouldn't be any.

Character 1 [en]: [guilty] You know, I mean, I've been trying to get out of that life, um, but sometimes, [struggling], it feels like the past has hooks in me that I can't, [desperate], shake no matter how hard I try, well, anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] Everyone deserves a second chance and you're still my, [gentle], brother despite everything.

Character 1 [en]: Um, would you maybe want to, [hopeful], show me around your work site sometime, I mean, [hesitant], seeing what you've built might help me remember what, [wistful], honest work feels like, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [contemplative] Well, um, I could probably arrange a tour next week when, [trusting], the crew's off for maintenance, I mean, maybe seeing something productive would be good for you.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] That would mean everything to me, [emotional], watching you explain your systems and seeing how you've made something, [admiring], meaningful out of your life when I've just been destroying things.

Character 2 [en]: [supportive] Um, hey, we all take different paths and, [reassuring], yours brought you back here asking for help, well, that takes courage.

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] Sometimes I wonder if you can tell when I'm being, [quiet], completely honest with you anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [knowing] I can tell you're carrying something heavy but I also see you're, [compassionate], trying to find your way back, and that's what matters even if you can't, [understanding], tell me everything yet. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, next week then, um, maybe after I see your work, [hopeful], I'll finally have the courage to tell you what I've really been, [heavy], planning all along. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [patient] Um, whenever you're ready to talk, I mean, [steady], I'll be here working the same routes, same tunnels, same schedule every week.
