=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] I got the offer yesterday from Lincoln Center and I've been, [overwhelmed], sitting in our workshop staring at the half-built sets we're making for next month's show, [guilty], wondering how I could even think about, [breaking], leaving everyone behind.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] You called me after three years of silence because you're, [knowing], terrified of becoming exactly what you used to judge me for becoming—someone who chose, [heavy], prestige over community.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] That's not why I called you, I just needed someone who understands both, [desperate], worlds and wouldn't immediately tell me I'm insane for even hesitating.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Look, um, I remember when you, well, literally threw paint at me, er, the day I told you I was leaving theater to, umm, coach executives.

Character 1 [en]: The collective needs me right now because we're barely, [cracking], surviving on donations and volunteer labor and everyone's exhausted from fighting just to exist.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] But you're exhausted too.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Of course I'm exhausted but that's what, [passionate], commitment looks like in real art, not your corporate PowerPoints. [laughs darkly]

Character 2 [en]: You think I don't miss the sawdust and paint fumes and that, [wistful], electric feeling on opening night when everything finally comes together? [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [softer] Sometimes I walk past your old workspace and I can still see the models you built, [nostalgic], those impossible dreamscapes that made everyone believe we could create magic.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] Every executive I coach gets the same speech about, [intense], vision and purpose but none of them have ever looked at me the way our actors did when we, [voice breaking], revealed a new set that transported them to another, [choked up], world entirely.

Character 1 [en]: Then why did you leave us for spreadsheets and, [accusatory], leadership seminars and all that corporate emptiness? [sharp exhale]

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Um, well, because I couldn't, er, afford insulin anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Lincoln Center has, umm, full benefits and they're offering me, like, [stunned], three times what I make now, and I mean, [conflicted], my partner just found out she's pregnant and we're living in a, well, [desperate], studio apartment with black mold. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [firm] So, um, here's what I know after, well, five years of helping people navigate these crossroads—you can't, [deliberate], pour from an empty cup, and, er, martyrdom doesn't actually, [pointed], serve the art you claim to love. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: The collective saved me when I had nothing, gave me, [grateful], purpose when I was lost, and now they're counting on me to help them, [torn], survive this crisis.

Character 2 [en]: [wise] Maybe the best thing you can do for them is show them it's possible to, [thoughtful], thrive instead of just survive. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] I'm terrified.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I know.

Character 1 [en]: What if, um, I take the job and lose the part of myself that, like, [vulnerable], makes the work matter?

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Well, um, what if you, er, don't?
