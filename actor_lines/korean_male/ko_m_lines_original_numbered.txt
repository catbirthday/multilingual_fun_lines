# Speaker Lines Only (Original English) - Korean (Male)
============================================================

1. [surprised] Yeah, well, I didn't expect to hear from you after, [guarded], everything that happened, um, but I mean, [softer], it's actually good timing since I could use someone to talk to about work.
2. [nostalgic] Those tunnels run right under half the valley now, [laughing], most people don't even know they connect to the new water management systems we're, [technical], installing for the casinos. [sighs]
3. [warming up] The whole irrigation network has to bypass the old tunnels but we use them for, [enthusiastic], maintenance access since they're already reinforced and, [proud], perfectly positioned for the main lines.
4. [relaxed] Actually, the security is pretty minimal down there since nobody really, [shrugging], thinks about water pipes as anything important, just me and my crew with basic keycards and, [chuckling], we know every inch of those passages by now. [yawns]
5. Um, honestly after watching you, [concerned], spiral into whatever it was you got mixed up in, well, I found peace in just, [earnest], making things grow in the desert, you know, creating life where there shouldn't be any.
6. [accepting] Everyone deserves a second chance and you're still my, [gentle], brother despite everything.
7. [contemplative] Well, um, I could probably arrange a tour next week when, [trusting], the crew's off for maintenance, I mean, maybe seeing something productive would be good for you.
8. [supportive] Um, hey, we all take different paths and, [reassuring], yours brought you back here asking for help, well, that takes courage.
9. [knowing] I can tell you're carrying something heavy but I also see you're, [compassionate], trying to find your way back, and that's what matters even if you can't, [understanding], tell me everything yet. [pauses]
10. [patient] Um, whenever you're ready to talk, I mean, [steady], I'll be here working the same routes, same tunnels, same schedule every week.
11. [stunned] Um, I don't know what you're, [confused], doing here but visiting hours ended and, well, [firm], these open flames are against every safety regulation we have, I mean, [trailing off], especially in room twelve.
12. [softly] I've been watching you visit every night for, [curious], three weeks and the way she seems to, [amazed], respond to your presence is unlike anything I've seen in, [whispering], fifteen years of hospice care. [pause]
13. [mesmerized] The lights in her room keep, [breathless], flickering whenever you speak those strange words.
14. [overwhelmed] Um, I've held so many hands as they've, well, [haunted], crossed over but I've never felt anything like the, [awestruck], energy that's building in this room right now, you know?
15. [vulnerable] Sometimes I sense where they're going and it's always, [peaceful], somewhere beautiful but with her it's different like she's, [confused], waiting for something specific before she can, [quiet], let go completely.
16. Even good witches can't cure, [compassionate], everything and maybe that's not weakness but wisdom.
17. [calm] I've seen enough unexplained healing in these, [accepting], rooms to know that medicine and magic aren't enemies. [smiles softly]
18. [determined] Tell me where to place my hands and I'll channel whatever, [brave], light I have through yours into hers because nobody, [fierce], should cross alone when there's love, [emotional], waiting to guide them.
19. [reverent] I can feel them all suddenly like they're, [amazed], standing with us in this room right now. [gasps softly]
20. [transcendent] She's saying something about how the student has become the, [tearful], teacher and that your healing gift was never meant for, [understanding], bodies but for souls finding their way, [whispered], home.
21. [defensive] It's been, [frustrated], manageable enough and I didn't want to bother anyone during, [bitter], the holidays when everyone has their own, [quietly], families to worry about.
22. Well, um, I didn't think it was, [hesitantly], that urgent and, uh, besides you already work too many hours as it is. [sigh]
23. [very quietly] I didn't want anyone to see me, [trembling], needing help like this.
24. [anxious] I mean, I've been sleeping in the, [exhausted], garage mostly and, um, only coming inside for, [shivering], coffee so maybe that's why I, well, didn't notice it getting worse.
25. [apologetic] The man who signs your paychecks shouldn't be, [embarrassed], calling you on Christmas weekend begging for, [very meekly], help with something this pathetic.
26. Well, um, that was just, [mumbling], good business sense since you turned out to be the best technician I've ever trained.
27. Um, I suppose I'd forgotten about, [regretful], all that, I mean, it feels like a lifetime ago.
28. You can't possibly have a, [skeptical], replacement unit on Christmas Eve and even if you did, [hopeful], the cost would be astronomical. [laugh]
29. [surprised] You mean you've been, [touched], preparing for something like this, um, just in case I needed it? [gasp softly]
30. [tearfully] I don't deserve this kind of, [overwhelmed], loyalty from anyone. [cry]
