Scenario: An oil burner technician arrives at their boss's home on Christmas Eve to fix a critical heating system failure, discovering their boss has been living alone in near-freezing conditions for days out of pride.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Mr. Henderson, um, you've been living like this for, [shaky voice], how long exactly, I mean, the temperature in here can't be more than, [worried], forty degrees?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] It's been, [frustrated], manageable enough and I didn't want to bother anyone during, [bitter], the holidays when everyone has their own, [quietly], families to worry about.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] You could have called me, [empathetically], three days ago when this started instead of sitting here in the, [angry], cold like some kind of stubborn martyr.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I didn't think it was, [hesitantly], that urgent and, uh, besides you already work too many hours as it is. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Look, I mean, you've been nothing but, [passionately], fair to me for fifteen years so, um, fixing your heat on Christmas Eve isn't, [relieved], some huge sacrifice, you know? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I didn't want anyone to see me, [trembling], needing help like this.

Character 1 [en]: Um, the boiler's completely shot, well, the heat exchanger cracked and, [confused], I don't understand how you didn't smell the, [loudly], carbon monoxide leak that could have, [very seriously], killed you. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] I mean, I've been sleeping in the, [exhausted], garage mostly and, um, only coming inside for, [shivering], coffee so maybe that's why I, well, didn't notice it getting worse.

Character 1 [en]: You've been sleeping in the, [furious], garage in December because you were too, [incredulous], proud to call your own employee for help, I mean, that's just, um, insane.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] The man who signs your paychecks shouldn't be, [embarrassed], calling you on Christmas weekend begging for, [very meekly], help with something this pathetic.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Um, you're not just the man who signs my paychecks though, you're, [sincerely], the person who gave me a chance when, well, nobody else would hire an ex-con and, [emotionally], taught me this whole trade from nothing, you know? [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, that was just, [mumbling], good business sense since you turned out to be the best technician I've ever trained.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] I mean, we both know it was more than that because, [crying while speaking], you vouched for me with your own reputation and, um, even let me crash at your place when I had, [gratefully], nowhere else to go. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: Um, I suppose I'd forgotten about, [regretful], all that, I mean, it feels like a lifetime ago.

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Well, um, I haven't forgotten and that's why I'm, [determined], installing a new system tonight even if it takes until morning.

Character 2 [en]: You can't possibly have a, [skeptical], replacement unit on Christmas Eve and even if you did, [hopeful], the cost would be astronomical. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [proudly] Actually, um, I've been rebuilding a high-efficiency unit in my garage for, [excited], months now and, well, it's perfect for this house.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You mean you've been, [touched], preparing for something like this, um, just in case I needed it? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [softly] I mean, you live alone now and, well, I've been, [choked up], worried about you since Margaret passed so, um, yeah, I wanted to be ready. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] I don't deserve this kind of, [overwhelmed], loyalty from anyone. [cry]
