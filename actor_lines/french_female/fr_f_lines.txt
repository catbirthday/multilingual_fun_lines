Customer: Oh hey! So I'm—wait actually—I think I need to, um, move my service? Yeah, movin' next week!
1. Hmm, let me see here... okay so between you and me? Moving service is actually one of my favorite things to help with because, um, I can usually sneak in some perks. Let me just pull up your account with reference number ACC-7829-XL94 here.
Customer: Ha! Perks? I like—no wait—I mean, yeah that's great! Movin' to downtown, the big glass tower?
2. Ohhh nice, the Meridian Tower? Yeah so, um, I'm seeing here that, hmm, we actually have fiber coverage there which means... okay so this is good news, your current plan PLN-4472-B can transfer but I might be able to, uh, upgrade you to our premium tier for the same price.
Customer: Um, wait really? That's—I mean, prob'ly should mention, uh, I'm actually VP at Morrison Tech now so kinda need solid service, you know?
3. Morrison Tech! Okay so, hmm, let me just... yeah we definitely want to make sure you're set up properly then. Your new address confirmation is ADR-9021-MT55 and, um, I'm actually going to flag this as a priority business transfer even though it's residential.
Customer: You can do that? I mean—wait—that's allowed?
4. Well, let's just say... hmm, technically your account shows three years of perfect payment history with reference REC-6634-AA so, um, I think we can make an exception here. When exactly are you planning to move?
Customer: Uh Thursday! Super fast, right? I know it's—er—kinda last minute but the penthouse just opened up and I couldn't say no!
5. Penthouse? Oh wow, living the dream! So, um, Thursday is... hmm, let me check our installation windows here... okay so normally we're booked but, uh, I'm seeing a cancellation for Thursday morning between 8 and 10, slot number SLT-1192-TH if you can make that work?
Customer: Perfect! Um, so like, what if—I mean, sort of worried 'bout the transfer? Last time with another company was a nightmare, you know?
6. Oh I totally get that concern. So, hmm, what I'm going to do here is... I'm putting a special note on order ORD-5547-PR that this needs our senior tech team, and, um, between you and me? I'm also adding my direct extension 4429 to your file so if anything goes sideways, you just call me directly.
Customer: Wait you're givin' me your direct line? That's—wow—actually nobody ever does that!
7. Well, um, I mean you seem pretty cool and, hmm, honestly? After three years of being a great customer, you deserve to not have to explain everything again if you need help. Plus your confirmation number CNF-8823-VIP is, uh, going into our priority queue.
Customer: Um, okay so, er, do you know who I should talk to 'bout gettin' the premium channels too? Think I deserve the full package at the new place.
8. Hmm, actually... let me just, um, handle that right now for you. So I'm seeing our premium bundle package PKG-7701-MAX and, uh, with your loyalty status? I can add it for... okay so this is kind of ridiculous but it's showing only ten dollars more per month.
Customer: Ten bucks? That's it? I mean—wait—usually it's like fifty more! How'd you—?
9. Let's just say, um, I might have applied a couple of, hmm, "promotional codes" that technically expired but, uh, the system still accepts them. Codes PMO-2234-X and PMO-5567-Z if anyone asks, but, you know, they probably won't.
Customer: Er, you're kinda the best, you know that? Like I was ready to throw down my VP card and demand stuff but you just—yeah—made it easy!
10. Aww, well, um, honestly? You made my day too! So everything's confirmed with master order number MAS-9902-COMPLETE, Thursday morning installation at the Meridian Tower penthouse, and, hmm, I've made sure you're getting our white glove treatment. Anything else I can sneak in for you today?
Customer: Look, I just—no wait, I mean I placed three sep—three different orders. Yesterday. Can't combine 'em?
11. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, I want to make sure I'm seeing everything correctly. Can I get your, um, what's the... your order confirmation number?
Customer: I got, um, like three of 'em. First one's, uh—sorry, lemme find—it's ORD-4—wait no, RD-482.
12. ORD-482, okay, um, and just to double-check, that's O-R-D dash four eight two? I'm seeing here that, uh, hmm, actually I need the full number with all the, um, all the characters after that?
Customer: Right. ORD-4827-MP. Other two are—they're somewhere in my email.
13. Perfect, so, um, I've got ORD-4827-MP here and, uh, let me see... okay so that one's, hmm, showing as already processed but not shipped yet, which is actually, um, good news for what you're trying to do.
Customer: Good. Yeah. Found 'em—wait, no that's—here. ORD-4829-LC and, um, ORD-4831-PR.
14. Okay okay, so, ummm, let me just, uh, make sure I've got all three... ORD-4827-MP, then, um, ORD-4829-LC, and, er, ORD-4831-PR. Is that, hmm, is that everything you wanted to combine?
Customer: That's it. Look, I just, um, I saw the shipping charges after and it's—I mean, it's like sixty bucks total for three packages.
15. Oh wow, yeah, so, um, sixty dollars is definitely, uh, that's a lot. Let me see here... hmm, okay so the system's showing me that, um, two of these are in our main warehouse—that's the MP and LC ones—but, uh, the PR order is coming from our, er, our satellite facility.
Customer: So can't do it? 'Cause I really—my kid's birthday, it's all stuff for that.
16. No no, wait, um, I think I can actually, uh, let me try something here... sometimes if I put in a, hmm, what's it called... a consolidation request? With the code CSL-MERGE-92, I can, um, I can override the facility difference.
Customer: You'd do that? I mean, um, that'd really—yeah. Please.
17. Absolutely, so, ummm, I'm putting in the request now and, uh, okay so the system's asking me to... hmm, wait, let me just verify your shipping address real quick? Just to make sure everything, um, everything goes to the right place?
Customer: 447 Elm Street. Austin. 78745.
18. Perfect, 447 Elm Street, Austin, 78745. So, um, good news—the consolidation went through with confirmation number CNF-88293-COMB, and, uh, instead of sixty dollars, you're looking at, hmm, just eighteen fifty for combined shipping.
Customer: Eight—eighteen fifty? That's, um, that's actually great. When's it—no wait—when's delivery?
19. So with the combined shipping, um, let me check the, uh, the estimated delivery... okay so all three items under tracking number TRK-293847-UPS should arrive by, hmm, Thursday the 15th. Is that, um, is that going to work for the birthday party?
Customer: Thursday works. Um, thanks for actually, uh, helping. Most times they just say no, can't—you know.
20. Oh, um, I totally get it, and honestly? Between you and me, the, uh, the consolidation thing isn't something we advertise but, hmm, for birthday parties especially, I always try to make it work. Your receipt number's going to be, um, RCP-77492-B and you should get an email confirmation in about, er, five minutes or so.
Customer: I'm sorry, I just—um, your automated thing kept, sort of, mishearing me? It thought I said "billing" but I kept saying—wait no, "shipping."
21. Oh no, yeah, I know, that system is honestly ridiculous sometimes. Um, let me just pull up your account here, uh, do you have your customer ID or order number handy?
Customer: Um, I think it's... probably starts with... sorry, I'm just flustered.
22. No no, totally get it, um, that phone system makes everyone crazy, uh, we actually had a meeting about it last week because, er, so many people complain. Take your time, I can look you up by phone number too.
Customer: Oh! That's—yes, please. Sorry for being such a mess about this.
23. Um, perfect, so I've got you here, customer ID CST-49982-LV, and uh, I can see your recent order, um, ORD-7263-XM92, is that what you were calling about?
Customer: Yes! I kept trying to say "track shipment" but it thought I was saying, I don't know, "back equipment" or something?
24. Yeah, it does that, um, especially with "track" for some reason, uh, it always thinks people are saying "back" or "black" and then, er, sends them to completely wrong departments. So anyway, let me check the tracking on ORD-7263-XM92 here.
Customer: I probably should've just... pressed zero earlier. Sorry. Is it—is the package okay though?
25. Um, so, uh, good news is it's definitely on its way, tracking number TRK-8829374-US, but, er, I'm seeing it's running about, hmm, a day behind schedule.
Customer: A day behind? But I need it—sorry, that's probably not your fault either.
26. No seriously, I'd be frustrated too. Um, the carrier had some weather delays yesterday, uh, but looking at your delivery area code ZIP-94022, it should, er, definitely arrive tomorrow by end of day.
Customer: Are you sure? I mean, I don't want to be difficult, but, um, tomorrow's kind of important.
27. Yeah, I'm pulling up the detailed tracking now on TRK-8829374-US and, um, it cleared the distribution center at 4 AM this morning, so, uh, unless something really unusual happens, you're good for tomorrow.
Customer: Okay. Sorry, I just—maybe I should've paid for faster shipping?
28. Um, honestly? The express shipping, uh, got delayed too with that weather, so, er, you actually saved money for the same result. Your confirmation RCP-7263-A shows standard shipping and, um, that was definitely the right call.
Customer: Oh. That's... that actually makes me feel better. Sort of. If it doesn't come tomorrow though?
29. So if it's not there by 8 PM tomorrow, um, call back with reference number REF-8827-DELAY and, uh, we'll overnight a replacement at no charge, er, and you'd get that Thursday guaranteed.
Customer: Okay, I'm writing that down—REF-882—wait, sorry, what was it again?
30. REF-8827-DELAY, and um, ask for a supervisor directly if you need to call back, uh, just skip that awful automated system entirely, er, honestly we all hate it as much as you do.
Customer: Hi! Um, so like, hmm, fifth time this year? Let me see here... uh, we're movin' again.
31. Oh wow, um, fifth time—that's, uh, that's a lot. I'm gonna—wait, let me pull up your account here—actually, what's your account number or, um, phone number on file?
Customer: It's, uh, wait. Hmm. Which one d'you need? See, that's the thing—
32. Either one works! I can look you up with—sorry, I mean, um, whatever's easier for you. I know with all the moves it gets, uh... confusing.
Customer: Okay so, um, lemme think... 555-0342? That still right? Or wait, hmm, might be the old one.
33. Perfect, got you right here! Account ACC-7749-MN2. And, um, I can see you've had—oh gosh—yeah, four address changes since January. Military family?
Customer: Yep! Navy wife. Fun times, right? So anyway, um, how quick can we—
34. Oh, I totally get it. My brother's Air Force, so... yeah, I know, it's ridiculous how often you have to move. Um, so I'm gonna make sure—let me set up something here that'll help. Your new address?
Customer: Um, hmm, 4421 Base Road. But wait. How do I know this won't just... mess everythin' up?
35. So, um, I'm setting you up with our, uh, military family profile code—MIL-PREF-0923—which basically means, um, next time you call? You just give them that code and we can update everything in like... thirty seconds instead of all this.
Customer: Really? That's—hmm, okay but like, why didn't anyone tell me 'bout this before?
36. Because honestly? Um, half our reps don't even—sorry, they don't know about it. It's not really, uh... advertised. But I'm making sure you're protected for next time.
Customer: Wait, so you're tellin' me, um, there's been a code this whole time? Hmm. Seems suspicious.
37. I know, I know how it sounds. But look, um, I'm putting a note here—NOTE-85542-JK—that says, uh, "frequent military relocations, priority handling required" so even if you don't remember the code, anyone who pulls this up will... you know...
Customer: Okay so, um, lemme get this straight. You're like, actually helpin'? Not just, hmm, readin' a script?
38. Um, yeah, no, I'm—look, moving five times in a year is, uh, it's insane, and our system makes it worse. So I'm updating your address to 4421 Base Road, confirmation CNF-2290-BASE, and, um, adding every single flag I can to make your life easier because... that's just ridiculous what you're dealing with.
Customer: Ha! Y'know what? I like you. Um, so, hmm, what if we move again next month?
39. Then you call, give them code MIL-PREF-0923 or reference, um, today's interaction ID INT-445821, and they'll... sorry, WE'LL get you sorted immediately. Also I'm waiving the, uh, the address change fee that's been charged to you the last four times because that's just...
Customer: Wait wait wait. There's been FEES? Um, hmm, nobody said—how much we talkin' here?
40. So you've been charged, um, fifteen dollars each time—total of sixty dollars—which is, uh, absolutely getting refunded. Credit ref CRD-9901-RFND will show up in, um, three to five days. Military families shouldn't pay to... to update addresses when you're literally serving the country, that's just...
Character 1: So um, have you ever tried, basically, creative writing as therapy?
41. Well, I've been facilitating creative writing therapy groups for, you know, about three years now and it's sort of transformative. People often discover things about themselves they never knew were buried.
Character 1: That sounds really [long pause] intense for people.
42. It can be, but we start gently with simple prompts like describing a safe place or writing letters to their younger selves. The beauty is that metaphor and fiction create this protective distance from raw emotions.
Character 1: How does fiction help with real problems though?
43. When someone writes about a character facing their struggles, they're processing their own experiences without the overwhelming directness of "I" statements. It's like looking at your life through a softer lens while still doing the deep work.
Character 1: My therapist suggested I [cry loudly] try it but I'm terrified.
44. That fear is actually really common, er, because writing makes thoughts permanent in a way that talking doesn't, I mean. But you can always burn, shred, or delete what you write - the healing happens in the process, not the product.
Character 1: Do people share their writing in groups?
45. Hmm, sharing is always optional, honestly, and about half choose to keep their work private, like completely. What matters is the act of translating emotions into words, giving shape to things that felt shapeless.
Character 1: What if someone's not good at writing?
46. There's no "good" or "bad" in therapeutic writing - it's not about crafting beautiful sentences but about authentic expression. Some of my most breakthrough sessions involved stick figures, single words repeated, or angry scribbles that became words.
Character 1: So, uhh, what kind of prompts do you use?
47. We might write about doors we're afraid to open, conversations with our fears as characters, or rewrite difficult memories with different endings. Sometimes I'll bring in objects like keys or shells and ask people to write their stories.
Character 1: The thing is, uh, I don't even know where to start anyway.
48. Start with lists - things that make you angry, moments you felt powerful, colors that match your moods. Lists are writing with training wheels, building confidence before diving into paragraphs.
Character 1: I guess, umm, that seems really manageable.
49. Right so, even writing for five minutes about why you can't write is, basically, still writing, ah? The resistance itself becomes material to explore, which often leads to unexpected breakthroughs.
Character 1: Okay so, err, would you recommend starting alone or, you know, in a group?
50. It's just that starting alone lets you build trust with yourself first, mmm, but groups offer this incredible mirror effect where hearing others' struggles makes yours feel less isolating, actually. Both paths lead to healing, just through different doors.
Character 1: Hi, I'm, uh, Sarah, and honestly, I'm not great at, you know, introductions.
51. Nice to meet you Sarah! I'm Marcus and I [enunciating every word] completely understand that feeling. Introductions are weird because you're trying to sum yourself up in a few sentences when you're obviously so much more complex than that.
Character 1: Exactly! Like how do you even pick what to share?
52. Well, I usually start with, um, the basics and then, I guess, let the conversation naturally evolve from there, you know? Work stuff, hobbies, random facts about yourself—whatever feels authentic in the moment rather than forcing some rehearsed elevator pitch.
Character 1: I work in accounting, which sounds boring but it's actually not.
53. Accounting gets such, er, a bad reputation but [very loudly] numbers tell stories, right, I mean they really do! Every spreadsheet is basically a narrative about how a business operates, where money flows, what priorities matter—it's detective work with math.
Character 1: You get it! Most people's eyes glaze over when I mention it.
54. People think it's, like, all calculators and receipts, but actually, you're basically solving puzzles all day, hmm? Finding discrepancies, spotting patterns, making sure everything balances—it requires serious analytical thinking and attention to detail.
Character 1: So, um, what do you do, I mean, for work or, well, otherwise?
55. I'm a [stuttering] f-freelance graphic designer, which m-means I work from home mostly. Some days I'm creating logos for startups, other days it's wedding invitations or restaurant menus—the variety keeps things interesting even when clients are being difficult.
Character 1: That [sleepily] sounds really creative and flexible.
56. It definitely has its perks, though the isolation can be tough sometimes. You end up having full conversations with your cat just to hear another voice, and suddenly realize you haven't left the house in three days.
Character 1: I, actually, work from home twice a week now, and [formal] honestly, the quiet is, you know, kind of nice.
57. The quiet is, uh, definitely peaceful at first, but then, I guess, it becomes almost too quiet, you know? You start missing those random water cooler conversations or even just hearing other people existing nearby—humans aren't meant to work in complete isolation.
Character 1: Do you ever work from coffee shops?
58. Coffee shops are, well, hit or miss—sometimes the background noise is, like, perfect for focus, but honestly, other times it's chaos. You'll be deep in a project when someone starts a loud phone call about their medical problems right next to you.
Character 1: Yeah, I, er, tried that once and couldn't concentrate at all, basically, with all the, you know, distractions.
59. The distractions are, um, definitely real, but [very sincerely] sometimes being around people, even strangers, actually helps with creativity, I mean. There's something about that ambient energy that makes you feel less alone in your work, even if nobody's actually talking to you.
Character 1: That makes sense. Maybe I should give it another try.
60. You should, but, hmm, pick your spot carefully—some places are, well, more conducive to work than others, right? Look for those quieter neighborhood cafes rather than the busy downtown chains where everyone's basically shouting over the espresso machine.
Character 1: So, um, I've been trying to, like, parallelize this image processing algorithm but, honestly, it's running slower than the sequential version.
61. Oh yeah, that's, uh, super common actually—parallelization overhead can, you know, totally kill performance if your workload isn't big enough. Are you using threads or processes, I mean, what's your setup?
Character 1: I'm using Python's multiprocessing pool with eight workers.
62. Python multiprocessing for image processing... that's [joking] brave of you! But seriously, the pickle serialization between processes can be a massive bottleneck, especially if you're passing large image arrays back and forth.
Character 1: Wait, er, what do you mean by pickle serialization? I thought, well, the processes would just, kind of, share the memory somehow.
63. Nope nope, so, Python processes can't share memory directly—they're, basically, completely separate. Every time you send data to a worker, hmm, Python has to serialize it, send it over, then deserialize it on the other side.
Character 1: That explains why my 4K images are taking forever.
64. Exactly! For image processing you'd probably want shared memory arrays or maybe just use NumPy with proper vectorization. Sometimes good NumPy code beats naive parallelization by a mile.
Character 1: I tried NumPy but I don't really understand vectorization.
65. Vectorization is, um, basically letting NumPy's [quickly] C backend handle your loops instead of Python—like, you operate on entire arrays at once. It's usually way faster than, actually, explicit parallelization for many operations.
Character 1: But, uh, what if I really need, you know, actual parallel processing? Like, er, for real-time video processing or something?
66. Then you'd want to, honestly, look into proper frameworks—OpenCV uses, well, optimized C++ under the hood, or maybe, I guess, GPU acceleration with CUDA if you're doing heavy lifting.
Character 1: GPU programming seems [very sad] impossibly complex though, all those kernels and memory management.
67. It's gotten way easier! Libraries like CuPy literally let you write NumPy-style code that runs on the GPU. You don't need to touch raw CUDA unless you're doing something really specialized.
Character 1: Really? That actually sounds manageable.
68. Yeah and for your image stuff specifically, there's also things like RAPIDS or even just PyTorch for image operations. They handle all the scary memory transfer optimization behind the scenes.
Character 1: Would PyTorch work for non-neural network stuff?
69. Absolutely! PyTorch is, er, just a tensor library at its core—people use it for, like, all sorts of scientific computing. The GPU acceleration and, basically, automatic differentiation are just bonuses.
Character 1: This is, well, making me rethink my whole approach. Maybe I should, um, just start over with, actually, a different framework entirely.
70. Starting fresh isn't always bad—sometimes you, honestly, need to pick the right tool first. Parallel computing is [passionately] all about matching your problem to the right abstraction level, and, you know, Python multiprocessing is rarely the answer for number crunching!
Character 1: [nervous] I know I've been gone for, [shaky voice], three years serving the lord's estate but I'm, [desperate], here now and ready to be part of, [quieter], Elara's life again.
71. [measured] She doesn't even remember you, [cold], not really, just the stories I've told her about the, [bitter], parent who chose duty over, [trailing off], being here when she took her first steps. [sighs]
Character 1: [defensive] Well, um, I mean, I didn't choose anything—the summons wasn't, [frustrated], something I could refuse, you know that better than anyone.
72. [gentle] There's always a choice even when, [softer], it feels like there isn't one to make at all.
Character 1: [pleading] Look, I, umm, I know you're angry and, well, you have every right to be but I'm, [breaking], trying to make this work somehow, er, for her sake.
73. [careful] Making it work means, [patient], showing up every single day not just when your, [firm], lord releases you from service to play at being, [sharp], a parent for a few months. [exhales slowly]
Character 1: [hurt] That's not fair because you knew what, [desperate], my obligations were when we first had her together.
74. [scattered] Um, knowing something and, well, living through it alone while she, [trembling], cries for someone who isn't there are, umm, completely different experiences that I can't, [hollow], just forget. [long pause]
Character 1: [earnest] I sent money every month and, [guilty], wrote letters even though I knew she couldn't, [quieter], read them yet but I wanted her to have them.
75. [weary] Money doesn't answer the questions about why, [pained], daddy lives in a castle while she lives here wondering if, [breaking], she did something wrong. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [desperate] Please just let me try to, [determined], fix this because I can't change the past but, [hopeful], I can be here now if you'll let me.
76. [conflicted] Well, um, she needs stability not someone who might, [worried], disappear again when the next summons arrives, you know?
Character 1: [resolute] My service ends next month and I've already, [emotional], told them I won't be returning because being her parent matters, [firm], more than any title or position they could, [quieter], ever offer me now.
77. [surprised] You're giving up your, umm, knighthood for this, I mean, for her, [stunned], after working toward it your whole life?
Character 1: [soft] Um, well, I realized that, er, all those oaths about protecting the innocent mean, [tender], nothing if I can't protect my own daughter from, you know, growing up without me.
78. [wavering] She likes strawberries.
Character 1: Just like her mother.
79. She has your stubbornness though—won't, um, give up on anything once she sets her, [gentle], mind to it, like, even impossible puzzles that frustrate her to tears.
Character 1: I want to know everything about her that I've, [regretful], missed and I know it will take time to earn both, [determined], your trust and hers but I'm not going, [firm], anywhere this time. [voice steady]
80. [accepting] Tomorrow morning then, she wakes at sunrise and, [warmer], always wants someone to watch the birds with her.
Character 1: [trembling] So you're the one who's been, um, [furious], teaching my daughter how to, well, [barely controlled], kill people behind my back for the past, I mean, six months.
81. Teaching her to, uh, [steady], survive is more accurate, and she came to me, you know, [matter-of-fact], begging for lessons after those kids at school put her in the hospital, I mean, twice.
Character 1: [stunned] Well, um, what?
82. [calm] She never told you about the bullying, um, [resigned], did she, or about how the school, well, [bitter], basically told her to just avoid them like that's even possible, you know. [sighs]
Character 1: She said she fell during, [disbelieving], gym class and the other time was just, [voice breaking], a stupid accident with her locker door.
83. [gentle] Look, um, your kid's got real talent and, I mean, [impressed], more importantly she's got the discipline to use it responsibly which is, well, [thoughtful], rare in someone so young, you know, especially after what she's been through.
Character 1: [desperate] But she's only sixteen and, um, [pleading], you're filling her head with ideas about joining some private military company, I mean, like it's a normal career path.
84. It pays better than, well, [pragmatic], most college degrees will ever get her, and umm, [frank], she'll learn skills that actually matter in the real world, not just, you know, [dismissive], theories from textbooks written by people who've never left their ivory towers.
Character 1: Skills that matter like, um, [sarcastic], what exactly—how to overthrow governments or, well, guard oil pipelines for corporations?
85. [defensive] Skills like situational awareness that, [firm], keeps you from becoming a victim, medical training that can, [passionate], save lives anywhere, and the confidence to, [proud], stand up for herself instead of hiding bruises under makeup.
Character 1: [breaking] Um, I just, well, wanted better for her.
86. [softer] Better doesn't always mean, um, [understanding], safer, and she knows that now because, well, [sympathetic], she's seen what happens when you can't protect yourself or, you know, the people you care about.
Character 1: [defeated] Every night I check on her and see, [tearful], those scars she thinks I don't know about.
87. [firm] Then you should understand why she needs, [earnest], this training more than she needs your protection because, [direct], protection without preparation just makes her dependent on others.
Character 1: You turned my baby girl into someone who, [anguished], dreams about combat zones instead of, [bitter], college dorms and first dates and all the, [voice cracking], normal things teenagers should want.
88. [quiet] She already lost those dreams when three kids, [grave], cornered her in that bathroom and showed her what, [hard], the world really is when nobody's coming to save you.
Character 1: [whispered] God, I mean, I didn't know it was, um, [horrified], that bad—she never said anything about, well, [guilty], being cornered or how many there were, you know. [long pause]
89. [measured] She's not running toward danger, um, [patient], she's learning to face it on her own terms, and I mean, [respectful], that takes more courage than either of us can, well, [honest], probably imagine at our age. [pauses]
Character 1: If she goes through with this, [hollow], if she enlists when she turns eighteen, [broken], will you at least promise to keep training her until then?
90. [solemn] I'll make sure she's more prepared than, [committed], I ever was at her age, and that's, [sincere], a promise I don't make lightly.
Character 1: [quiet] I need to, um, sell this and I know it's not, [ashamed], worth much but, well, it's all I have left from my service days. [sighs]
91. [stunned] Wait, this is, um, a Silver Star with, [recognizing], a specific battalion number that I, well, I've seen before.
Character 1: It was for pulling three guys out of a, [distant], burning Humvee outside Kandahar when an IED, [hollow], hit our convoy back in 2011. [long pause]
92. [trembling] My brother was, um, one of those three soldiers and he, [voice breaking], still talks about the sergeant who went back into the flames even after his, [overwhelmed], own uniform caught fire, I mean, that was you.
Character 1: [confused] Your brother was, uh, Private Martinez with the, [searching memory], crooked smile who kept photos of his kids taped inside his helmet, well, I always wondered if he made it home okay.
93. [emotional] He did. [crying]
Character 1: [gentle] That's good to hear because some nights I still, [haunted], wake up smelling that burning metal and wondering if saving them was worth what it cost me afterwards.
94. [desperate] Listen, um, I can't let you sell this medal when you, [choked up], saved the only family I have left, but I mean, I understand you need money so let me, [determined], help you another way.
Character 1: [defensive] I don't need charity, um, I just need enough for, [embarrassed], a room tonight because the shelter's full and it's supposed to drop below freezing again, you know.
95. Well, my brother owns, um, a construction company and he's been, [hopeful], looking for someone who understands discipline and hard work, and I mean, [careful], he never forgot the man who saved his life.
Character 1: I haven't had a real job in, uh, three years since the PTSD got bad and, well, [defeated], most places won't even look at someone with my history anymore. [sighs heavily]
96. [firm] He'll hire you today if you're willing because, um, he believes in, [passionate], second chances for people who've sacrificed everything, and well, there's an apartment above his office that's been empty for months. [pause]
Character 1: [whispered] I can't.
97. [soft] You went back into hell itself to save strangers, so um, maybe it's time you let, [gentle], someone return the favor by pulling you out of yours, I mean, that's what my brother would want.
Character 1: After everything that's happened, I forgot what it, [voice cracking], feels like when someone sees you as more than just another homeless vet. [tears]
98. [warm] You're not just another anything.
Character 1: [overwhelmed] When I came in here, um, I was ready to trade my last piece of pride for twenty dollars, but well, [grateful], somehow I'm walking out with something I thought I'd lost forever.
99. [earnest] My brother says that medal represents the best, [proud], moment of his worst day, and meeting you represents the best, [hopeful], moment of mine.
Character 1: I guess, um, sometimes life gives you these unexpected moments of grace when you're at, [wondering], rock bottom and least expecting them.
100. [certain] This isn't grace or luck, it's just, [steady], people taking care of each other the way we're supposed to. [smiles]
Character 1: [startled] Well, um, I didn't expect to find anyone, [cautious], in this abandoned place at three in the morning, especially not someone, [confused], painting fake windows on, [amused], broken walls.
101. [defensive] I mean, you're not exactly supposed to be here either, um, with your lockpicks and, [nervous], whatever else you're carrying in that bag that's, well, [accusatory], probably stolen from someone.
Character 1: [intrigued] So, uh, you come here to what—build, I mean, pretend worlds in a place that's, [gesturing], already dead while the rest of the city sleeps, [thoughtful], unaware? [chuckles darkly]
102. [retreating] These sets aren't pretend—they're, [passionate], more real than anything out there because they tell, [quieter], stories that actually matter instead of just, [bitter], taking from people. [sighs]
Character 1: [harsh] Um, that's rich coming from someone who's, well, technically trespassing just like me—we're both, [ironic], criminals here tonight, sweetheart.
103. [hurt] Well, I create things, um, beautiful things that might, [trembling], inspire someone someday, while you just, er, [disgusted], tear through people's lives and take what isn't, [angry], yours to take.
Character 1: [softer] You paint sunlight on walls that will, [wistful], never see the sun, build doorways that, [wondering], lead nowhere, craft entire worlds in shadows—maybe we're not, [contemplative], so different after all. [pause]
104. [surprised] Um, don't try to romanticize what you do by, well, [skeptical], comparing it to art—you destroy while I, er, [firm], desperately try to create something meaningful.
Character 1: Well, um, maybe destruction and creation are just, [philosophical], two sides of the same desperate need to, I mean, [vulnerable], matter in a world that doesn't, [bitter], care about either of us.
105. [wavering] Sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever, [sad], see what I've made here. [long pause]
Character 1: [gentle] I'm seeing it now, and it's, [appreciative], hauntingly beautiful—like finding flowers growing through concrete cracks. [sighs softly]
106. You know, um, the owner died three years ago and, [melancholic], his family just forgot this place exists, so I've been, well, [confessing], turning it into something that honors what theater used to, [nostalgic], mean.
Character 1: [understanding] That's why you risk coming here every night—building, [admiring], memorials to forgotten dreams.
107. And you risk everything to, [curious], take things—what are you really looking for out there? [pause]
Character 1: [vulnerable] Um, I guess I'm looking for proof that, well, [searching], something matters enough to protect, to, [broken], keep safe from people like me.
108. [firm] Well, then stop taking things and, um, maybe try, [hopeful], creating something worth protecting instead, you know?
Character 1: [contemplating] Your painted sunset on that backdrop is catching, [mesmerized], real moonlight through the broken roof—it's making something, [awestruck], impossible happen, something that shouldn't exist but, [moved], somehow does. [exhales slowly]
109. [proud] Every impossible thing starts with someone, [passionate], deciding to try anyway, with choosing to build rather than, [pointed], break, to leave something behind that might, [wistful], outlast us.
Character 1: I mean, um, maybe you're right about choosing what we, [uncertain], leave behind—maybe I've been, well, [regretful], running from the wrong things and toward the, [realizing], wrong endings.
110. [quiet] Well, um, stay then. [hopeful]
Character 1: [tense] The mother's testimony is scheduled for, [checking notes], next Tuesday which means we need to move the child, [urgent], before the syndicate realizes there's leverage they haven't considered yet.
111. Well, um, I understand the urgency but this five-year-old has already been through, [protective], three foster homes in the past year, and I mean, another sudden relocation could cause irreversible psychological damage, you know. [sighs]
Character 1: [firm] She's in danger.
112. [frustrated] Every child in my care deserves stability and you're asking me to, [struggling], uproot her entire world based on threats that may never materialize.
Character 1: [anxious] Um, look, I've seen what these people do to, [haunted], family members of witnesses and, well, I mean, trust me when I say the foster home trauma is nothing compared to, [breaking], what could happen if we don't move fast.
113. [defensive] Well, you know, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, um, I've never had to, [angry], choose between a child's immediate safety and their, [voice cracking], long-term emotional wellbeing like this, and I mean, there has to be, [desperate], another way to protect her.
Character 1: [softer] There's something about this case I'm not, [hesitant], authorized to share but if you knew what I, [careful], know, you'd already have her packed.
114. [suspicious] So, um, you're asking me to traumatize this little girl based on, [bitter], classified information that you can't even, well, verify, while I'm supposed to just, [incredulous], trust your judgment about her life, you know?
Character 1: [pleading] The syndicate has already killed two witnesses this month and they've been, [whispering], asking questions about the mother's family connections at her old, [trembling], neighborhood which means they're getting closer to discovering, [very quiet], Emily exists. [pauses]
115. [stunned] You just used her name which violates every protocol we, [realizing], established about keeping her identity separate from her mother's case, [shaking], and now I understand you're more terrified than you're, [emotional], letting on. [long pause]
Character 1: I've been watching the surveillance footage of men photographing, [grim], her daycare center for the past three days. [exhales heavily]
116. [resolute] Then we move tonight but I'm coming with her through the, [determined], entire relocation process because she trusts me and I won't, [fierce], let her face this alone.
Character 1: [relieved] Well, um, thank you.
117. [quiet] I'll need to create a cover story for her current foster family that won't, [thoughtful], raise suspicions but also explains why she's suddenly, [sad], gone without causing them to file missing person reports.
Character 1: [grateful] Um, I mean, I've already prepared documentation showing she's being, [careful], transferred to a specialized medical facility for, well, treatment that her current placement can't provide, you know. [sighs softly]
118. [accepting] Give me two hours to pack her favorite toys and the, [tender], blanket she can't sleep without because maintaining those small, [breaking], comforts might be all that keeps her grounded.
Character 1: [determined] We'll keep her safe.
119. I know, um, but safe doesn't always mean, [heavy], undamaged, and well, that's what keeps me up at night, you know.
Character 1: [honest] When this is over and her mother's testimony puts these monsters away, [hopeful], Emily will have a chance at a real life with adoptive parents who'll never have to, [emotional], look over their shoulders, and maybe that future is worth, [quiet], this temporary hell.
120. [resigned] Well, I mean, I'll hold you to that promise because, um, if we're wrong about this and she ends up, [fearful], more broken than before, I'll never forgive either, [bitter], of us for what we're about to, [trailing off], do, you know.
Character 1: [desperate] Please, help me.
121. [shocked] Oh my God, um, Riley? I mean, is that really you standing here with, well, your face all swollen like that after, er, five years of nothing?
Character 1: Look, I know we haven't, [strained], talked since I dropped out and you went to, [bitter], medical school, but right now my throat is, [panicked], closing up and I can't breathe properly.
122. [professional] Okay, um, sit down immediately and, [focused], tell me what you've been exposed to in the last, [urgent], hour—did you eat something, er, get stung, or touch anything unusual?
Character 1: [wheezing] The new tattoo ink at the shop had something, [gasping], different in it and now everything's burning. [coughs]
123. Um, well, stay still.
Character 1: You know, I wouldn't have come here if, [embarrassed], I had literally any other option, um, but the emergency room would mean, well, bankruptcy.
124. [gentle] I'm getting the epinephrine now, and um, for what it's worth, I'm, [conflicted], glad you came here even if it's just because you're, [sad], desperate, because at least I know you're, well, still alive. [sighs]
Character 1: [defensive] Don't make this into some kind of, [uncomfortable], reconciliation moment while I'm literally dying here, okay?
125. [administering shot] This might sting a bit but you'll, [reassuring], feel better in about thirty seconds, and then we need to, [careful], monitor you for the next hour. [pauses]
Character 1: [breathing easier] God, um, I forgot how you always, [grudging], knew exactly what to do in a crisis, even when we were kids and I'd, [nostalgic], get into trouble, you'd somehow, well, fix everything.
126. Well, um, not everything.
Character 1: [quiet] Mom's death.
127. [soft] Yeah, well, that's why I went into public health, um, trying to prevent what we couldn't, [voice breaking], prevent for her, while you, er, went the opposite direction.
Character 1: Music was the only thing that made, [raw], sense after she died.
128. [tentative] I actually, um, downloaded your band's EP last month, and well, that song about hospital waiting rooms made me, [emotional], cry in my office. [laughs softly]
Character 1: You know, I wrote that one thinking about all those nights we, [vulnerable], spent there with her, um, pretending everything would be okay.
129. [hopeful] Well, maybe after you're stable, um, we could grab coffee and actually, [nervous], talk instead of just existing in the same city pretending the other doesn't exist?
Character 1: [considering] Your medical knowledge just saved my, [reluctant], life, so I guess I owe you at least one conversation about, [lighter], something other than dying. [half-laughs]
130. [relieved] Look, um, the swelling's going down already, and well, your color's coming back, which means you're, [professional], responding well to the treatment, but also means you're, [personal], going to be okay, and er, maybe we can be too. [sighs deeply]
Customer: Um, yeah so I'm calling about—wait let me—I'm calling about my reimbursement check that never... hmm, let me think here...
131. Hi there! Um, I can definitely help with that. So, uh, just need to pull up your account here—what's your employee ID number? I think we can, um, track that down pretty quickly.
Customer: It's uh... 447—no wait, 474-829. The uniform reimbursement.
132. Got it, um, 474-829... okay so I'm seeing here, hmm, your last reimbursement request RMB-9042-TK was, uh, processed on the 15th. Should've arrived by now, I think.
Customer: Right so that's—I mean that's the problem—it never showed up and I'm getting, um, pretty frustrated here.
133. Oh! Um, I totally understand that frustration. Let me just, uh, check the payment status here... REF-9042-TK shows, hmm, mailed on the 17th to your address on file.
Customer: Okay so that means—wait, hmm, what if it got lost? I mean I deliver mail, I know things disappear.
134. Right right.
Customer: Can you just—no wait actually—can you reissue it today? Like, um, I don't have time for all this back and forth.
135. So, um, I can definitely start that process. The thing is, uh, for check CHK-8827-MN over fifty dollars, I need to, hmm, verify it wasn't cashed first. Takes maybe, um, two business days?
Customer: Two days? I mean, do you know how long I've already—sorry, I mean—this is ridiculous.
136. I know, I know. Um, actually, let me see if... hmm, there might be another option here. Can I, uh, put you on a brief hold? Maybe thirty seconds?
Customer: Um, fine but—I mean just—yeah okay whatever, just hurry.
137. Absolutely.
Customer: So? What's the—let me guess—another delay?
138. No no! So, um, good news actually. I found, uh, an expedite code EXP-2847 that I can apply. We can, hmm, cancel the original and, um, issue direct deposit instead? Should hit by, uh, tomorrow morning.
Customer: Tomorrow? That's—wait no that's actually—hmm, okay so that means I'd have it for Friday?
139. Yep! Um, I just need to, uh, confirm your direct deposit info. Last four of your account on file is, hmm, 7829?
Customer: That's right. Listen, I'm a mail carrier—I mean we deserve better than lost checks, you know?
140. Oh absolutely, I, um, completely agree. You guys work so hard and, uh, this shouldn't happen. So I've noted everything under case CSE-4492-BN and, hmm, added a priority flag. Should be all set by tomorrow!
Customer: Euh, bonjour, euh, voyons voir... J'ai—j'ai ce paiement qui, euh, doit être traité? Pour—pour le lieu?
141. Ah je vois—laissez-moi juste—en fait attendez, euh, est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de compte d'abord? Je suis en train d'ouvrir le, euh, le système de paiement là et j'ai besoin de—hmm, oui j'en ai besoin pour consulter les détails spécifiques de votre transaction.
Customer: Oui oui oui, c'est euh... attendez, vraiment? Vous pouvez vérifier ça maintenant?
142. Absolument, alors euh, une fois que vous me donnez ce numéro de compte je peux tout voir—le statut du paiement, les délais, tout—mais je dois mentionner que, euh, on a eu des retards dans notre système aujourd'hui, alors j'espère que le vôtre n'est pas affecté mais laissez-moi—laissez-moi vérifier pour vous.
Customer: D'accord alors ça veut dire... euh, c'est c'est ACC-4439. C'est—c'est critique. Genre, vraiment vraiment critique.
143. Compris compris, alors je regarde le compte ACC-4439-P et, euh, je vois que vous avez un paiement en attente ici pour—oh là c'est conséquent—ça apparaît comme, euh, initié hier mais hmm... laissez-moi juste... bon alors malheureusement c'est dans ce qu'on appelle un statut de révision ce qui veut dire—et j'aurais vraiment aimé avoir de meilleures nouvelles—ça ne va pas passer avant demain au plus tôt.
Customer: Attendez attendez attendez, demain? Mais j'ai—j'ai besoin de ça AUJOURD'HUI. Le lieu, ils vont—ils vont me virer!
144. Je sais je sais, et croyez-moi si je pouvais juste, euh, appuyer sur un bouton et que ça se fasse instantanément je le ferais—mais ces blocages de révision sont, euh, ils sont automatiques selon le montant et je n'ai pas—hmm, en fait attendez, laissez-moi vérifier autre chose, parfois il y a une solution de contournement...
Customer: Euh, d'accord d'accord, alors vous—vous vérifiez? Je veux dire, euh, j'ai trois événements ce weekend, si je perds le lieu...
145. Bon alors, euh, je vois ici que votre transaction TXN-882947-VN est signalée parce qu'elle dépasse notre plafond journalier—mais voilà ce que je peux faire—enfin, c'est pas idéal mais—je peux diviser ça en deux paiements plus petits qui seraient, euh, ils seraient traités immédiatement, genre dans l'heure, mais vous devriez appeler votre lieu et expliquer les deux virements séparés.
Customer: Vraiment? Ça—ça marcherait? Genre dans L'HEURE l'heure?
146. Oui mais—et je déteste qu'il y ait un mais ici—euh, il y a des frais de traitement pour les virements express, ça va être, euh, laissez-moi calculer... bon alors c'est 47,50$ par transaction, donc vous regardez 95 dollars au total en frais et je sais que c'est pas—enfin, j'aimerais pouvoir les annuler mais le système ne me laisse pas.
Customer: Quatre-vingt-quinze... hmm, et si... d'accord d'accord, FAITES-LE. Juste—juste faites-le!
147. Euh, d'accord alors je—attendez en fait j'ai besoin de—laissez-moi obtenir une confirmation verbale, vous autorisez deux virements express de, euh, 4 250$ chacun avec les codes de confirmation EXP-7739-A et EXP-7739-B, frais totaux quatre-vingt-quinze dollars?
Customer: Oui oui oui! J'ai juste—j'ai juste besoin que ce soit fait. Attendez, vraiment? Ça sera là dans une heure?
148. Alors une fois que je soumets ça—ce que je fais maintenant en fait—vous allez recevoir, euh, vous allez recevoir les confirmations par email dans cinq minutes, et puis les fonds arrivent sur leur compte dans, euh, typiquement quarante-cinq minutes mais absolument dans l'heure, et franchement je suis vraiment contente qu'on ait trouvé une solution parce que je sais à quel point cette situation est stressante.
Customer: Euh, c'est... hmm, okay alors ça veut dire que je peux les appeler et—et leur dire que ça arrive?
149. Absolument absolument, et en fait donnez-leur ces numéros de référence—donc c'est REF-559048-RUSH1 et REF-559048-RUSH2—parce que, euh, leur banque peut les tracer immédiatement même avant que les fonds soient complètement compensés, ce qui parfois aide avec, euh, vous savez, gagner un peu de bonne volonté pendant qu'ils attendent.
Customer: D'accord d'accord d'accord, j'ai—j'ai noté ça. C'est vraiment—attendez, vraiment? C'est en train de se faire?
150. C'est fait, je viens d'appuyer sur soumettre alors, euh, vérifiez votre email dans environ trois minutes pour ces confirmations—et franchement, euh, bonne chance avec vos événements ce weekend, j'espère qu'ils se passeront bien après tout ce stress aujourd'hui, vraiment.
Customer: Alors j'ai reçu les—attendez, laissez-moi juste—placards. Faux. Tout est faux.
151. D'accord, euh, j'entends bien que vous êtes frustrée et, euh, laissez-moi d'abord... comment dire... reconnaître ça. Vous pouvez me donner votre numéro de commande pour que je, euh, puisse tout consulter et on va régler ça ?
Customer: Euh, c'est euh—attendez—je crois que c'est... non attendez, en fait—OLM-4492. Ou 4492-OLM. Un truc comme ça.
152. C'est noté, alors, euh, je vois ici que c'est en fait, euh, numéro de commande OLM-4492-BK7, et hmm, laissez-moi regarder les spécifications que vous avez commandées par rapport à ce qui... oh. Oh là là.
Customer: Évidemment. Ouais. Évidemment qu'il y a un "oh là là."
153. Alors, euhh, je vois que les mesures sont, euh, complètement différentes de ce que vous avez soumis, genre la profondeur indique 18 pouces mais vous aviez commandé, euh, 24 pouces, et la hauteur est... c'est pas du tout ça.
Customer: Cuisine du client. Demain. Installation.
154. Écoutez, euh, je sais que ça semble impossible là maintenant mais, euh, on va arranger ça, d'accord ? Laissez-moi juste, hmm, vérifier nos options express sous votre compte ACC-7829-ML...
Customer: Y'a pas de—enfin—comment vous pouvez même—demain. C'est demain.
155. Je consulte notre système de livraison d'urgence, code EFS-90124, et, euh, je vais m'assurer que vous soyez prise en charge, genre priorité absolue...
Customer: Euh, attendez—urgence ? C'est—c'est vraiment un truc qui existe ?
156. Alors, euh, c'est pas quelque chose qu'on publicise mais, euh, pour des situations comme celle-ci où c'est clairement notre erreur, je peux, hmm, activer le protocole PRX-5001 qui en gros veut dire...
Customer: Euh, alors genre—attendez, vous êtes vraiment—y'a vraiment quelque chose que vous pouvez, euh, faire là ?
157. Je vais personnellement superviser ce dossier, d'accord ? Votre nouvelle référence c'est REF-8956-XP2, et euh, il faut que vous sachiez que je ne laisserai pas ça foirer encore une fois...
Customer: Attendez, vraiment ? Genre, euh, vous pouvez vraiment avoir les bons pour—pour demain ?
158. Euhh, alors voilà ce que j'ai fait—j'ai marqué ça comme critique sous le ticket TKT-30459, et euh, j'ai notre entrepôt local qui vérifie le stock maintenant pour une livraison immédiate, euh, le jour même en fait.
Customer: Le jour même ? Vous êtes—attendez—euh, vous êtes sérieuse ? C'est, euh, c'est possible ça ?
159. L'entrepôt vient de confirmer sous vérification VRF-1128 que, euh, ils ont vos spécifications exactes en stock, et je, euh, m'assure que le chauffeur vérifie deux fois chaque mesure avant de partir.
Customer: Franchement je—enfin—waouh. Je m'attendais pas. Euh. Ça se passe vraiment ?
160. Euh, alors votre créneau de livraison c'est 14h à 16h aujourd'hui sous suivi TRK-6673-QM9, et écoutez, je vous donne mon poste direct—faites le 4429—parce que, euh, je veux que vous m'appeliez s'il y a le moindre problème, on va pas... ça n'arrivera plus.
Customer: Euh, bonjour, oui alors j'appelle parce que, euh, mon assurance vient de, genre, augmenter de, euh, je pense que c'était peut-être 200 dollars? Et euh, personne ne m'a rien dit sur pourquoi et je serais vraiment, euh, reconnaissante pour toute aide que vous pourriez me donner.
161. D'accord je peux certainement vous aider avec ça aujourd'hui, laissez-moi juste chercher votre numéro de police rapidement—est-ce que vous l'avez sous la main ou je devrais le chercher par votre nom?
Customer: Oh euh, oui je pense que c'est, euh, attendez laissez-moi le trouver... euh, c'est celui qui commence par genre PLC? Ou, euh, peut-être c'est autre chose, je suis un peu, vous savez, confuse avec tous ces numéros.
162. [exhales] C'est parfaitement correct, euh, laissez-moi juste... comment dire... faire une référence croisée de votre compte ici. Alors j'aurai besoin de votre nom complet et, euh, le code postal sur la police, and then I can pull up everything including your policy number PLC-449821-V7.
Customer: Oh wow merci beaucoup, oui c'est David Chen, 94102, et sérieusement je suis vraiment reconnaissante que vous cherchiez ça pour moi.
163. Bon alors, euh, j'ai votre compte ici David et, euh, je peux voir l'augmentation de prime qui est entrée en vigueur et... hmm, laissez-moi juste vérifier les, euh, les notes ici sur le compte ADJ-20241105-SF.
Customer: Euh, attendez vous avez dit que c'est déjà passé? Parce que genre, euh, je pensais que c'était peut-être juste une erreur ou quelque chose? Je veux dire, euh, j'ai conduit pour Uber et, euh, rien n'a changé, vous savez?
164. Oui malheureusement ça a été traité le 1er novembre, et en regardant votre dossier ici je peux voir le code d'ajustement RTE-RIDESHARE-01 qui indique—this is related to commercial usage disclosure.
Customer: Commercial? Mais je, euh, attendez je vous ai parlé du truc Uber quand je, euh, quand j'ai pris la police au début, non? Ou, euh, peut-être c'était... hmm, c'était une autre compagnie?
165. [sharp inhale] Laissez-moi vérifier votre application originale de mars, donnez-moi juste un moment pour réviser le document APP-3847291-DC.
Customer: Oh euh, merci tellement de vérifier tout ça, je suis vraiment, euh, I mean I'm just so confused parce que genre, euh, je pensais que tout était bien configuré et euh, vous savez, j'apprécie vraiment que vous preniez le temps ici.
166. Alors je vois ici que, euh, la déclaration de covoiturage était en fait, euh, ajoutée à votre dossier en octobre through form FRM-1099-UPDATE et c'est ce qui... hmm, c'est ce qui a déclenché le recalcul du tarif dans le code système CALC-88472-AUTO.
Customer: Octobre? Mais je conduis depuis genre janvier ou décembre peut-être?
167. [exhales] Bon, alors ce qui s'est passé ici c'est, euh, et je vois ça beaucoup en fait, euh, la police initiale n'avait pas le code d'endossement commercial END-RS-2024 et quand on a reçu les informations mises à jour ça devait être, euh, recalculé.
Customer: Euh, d'accord alors genre, je pense que je comprends mais, euh, pas vraiment en fait? Genre vous dites que j'avais besoin d'une sorte de, euh, c'était quoi, truc d'endossement? And that makes it cost more?
168. Exactement, conduire pour le covoiturage nécessite une couverture spécifique qui coûte plus cher due to the increased risk factors documented in rate table RT-2024-Q4-COMM.
Customer: Oh là là, euh, j'aurais vraiment aimé que quelqu'un me dise ça plus tôt mais, euh, je veux dire, merci beaucoup d'expliquer tout ça, genre je suis vraiment, euh, reconnaissante que vous me guidiez à travers tout même si je suis un peu, euh, lente à comprendre.
169. Vous n'êtes pas lente du tout David, la terminologie d'assurance est confuse et honnêtement je suis encore en train d'apprendre certaines choses moi-même—laissez-moi voir s'il y a un code de réduction que je peux appliquer pour aider à compenser cette augmentation.
Customer: Vraiment? Oh mon dieu, euh, ce serait incroyable si vous pouviez, euh, I mean even if you can't, genre, euh, vous avez été tellement utile déjà et euh, j'apprécie vraiment vraiment que vous essayiez.
170. Alors, euh, j'ai trouvé le code de réduction DISC-SAFE-DRIVER-15 qui vous donne 15 pourcent de rabais et, euh, j'applique aussi le crédit CRD-99847-LOYALTY pour être avec nous depuis plus de 6 mois, so that should, hmm, réduire votre prime d'environ 70 dollars au total.
Customer: I just... I can't understand these charges. Two hundred dollars extra.
171. Thank you for calling. Um, let me just... pull up your account here. Could I get your, uh, order number or... if you have that handy?
Customer: It's... somewhere here. I just... everything's a mess.
172. That's okay. Take your time. Um, we can also look it up by, uh, your business name or email if that's... I mean, whatever's easier for you right now.
Customer: Global Spice Trading. The order to Germany last week.
173. Perfect. Let me just... okay so I'm seeing, um, order number ORD-4429-SP91 here. Shipped November 15th. And, uh, you're asking about the... hmm, these additional charges that came through?
Customer: Nobody told me. Nobody said there'd be... I planned everything and now...
174. Right. So, um, I can see what happened here. The thing is—um, let me just—okay so your shipment crossed through, uh, multiple customs zones. Transaction ID TXN-88542-CU shows... hmm, how do I explain this...
Customer: Multiple zones? But it's just—it goes from here to Germany, that's...
175. Yeah so, um, it's actually... complicated. Your package went through, uh, through Newark first. Then London. Then, um, finally to Frankfurt. Each transfer point has its own... well, its own fee structure.
Customer: This is. Absolutely. Unacceptable.
176. I completely understand your frustration. Um, looking at your account... reference number REF-2298-XK... these surcharges should have been, uh, disclosed during checkout. Let me see if... hmm, if something went wrong there.
Customer: Should have been disclosed. Yes. Precisely. They weren't.
177. So, um, I'm checking the system and, uh, there's a note here. Invoice INV-66019-B. It looks like... hmm, these fees were added after, um, after your shipment was already processed because of... weight recalculation?
Customer: Weight recalculation. For spices. Sealed containers.
178. I know. It doesn't... okay so, um, here's what I can do. I'm going to, uh, escalate this to our billing team. Case number CSE-90124-RT. And, um, we'll review whether these charges were... properly communicated.
Customer: I need this fixed. My margins are already... I can't absorb this.
179. Absolutely. Yes. Um, so let me just... I'm adding priority status. Code PRI-445. And, uh, between you and me? These international fees have been, um, causing issues for other merchants too. We're actually... reviewing the whole process.
Customer: How long until someone contacts me about this?
180. So, um, with the priority code? Within 24 hours. Definitely. Uh, they'll call the number on file... ends in 7829? And they'll have, um, full authority to adjust these charges. Is that... will that work?
Customer: Do you know who I am? I'm the—actually, let me just—I'm the athletic director at Westfield University.
181. Oh! Um, hello Mr.—er, sorry, I didn't catch your, uh, your name there, but let me just, um, pull up your account and, uh, we'll get this sorted out for you, okay? So if you could just, um, give me your account number or, uh, maybe the order reference?
Customer: I think it's... hmm, let me see here... probably RFQ-2847 or something like that?
182. Perfect, so um, that's actually, uh—wait, let me just—okay so RFQ-2847-TK92, and I can see here that, um, you've been transferred... oh wow, uh, three times already today? That's, er, definitely not the experience we want for you, and um, I'm really sorry about that.
Customer: Um, yeah, so like, three different departments, and uh, nobody seems to know, um, where my equipment order even is.
183. Okay so, um, let me dig into this because, uh, this is like a... what's the word... a priority institutional account, and um, I can see you ordered—er, sorry, let me scroll—forty-seven items with purchase order PON-88459-QD on October 12th, is that right?
Customer: That's the one. Sort of ridiculous that nobody can tell me where it is, don't you think?
184. Um, absolutely, and uh, I'm actually seeing something really, um, interesting here—so your order got, uh, split into three shipments, and um, it looks like tracking number TRK-9901245-A went to—wait no, sorry, that's the wrong—let me just double-check this for you.
Customer: Oh great, so um, like, even you don't know? Uh, this is just, um, perfect.
185. No no, I've, um, I've got it! So uh, this is actually—oh! I see what happened here—your order got, er, flagged in our bulk processing system under code BLK-77234, and um, someone marked it as residential instead of institutional, which is, uh, why nobody could find it.
Customer: I manage, what, probably a twelve million dollar budget? And you're telling me it's marked residential?
186. I know, it's, um, it's completely wrong and uh, I'm fixing it right now—so the good news is, er, all three shipments with tracking TRK-9901245-A, TRK-9901246-A, and TRK-9901247-A are actually, um, already at your receiving dock as of, uh, let me see... yesterday at 2:47 PM.
Customer: Wait, they're—no wait, actually—they're already here?
187. Um, yes! So like, they've been signed for by, uh, someone with initials JMK at your, um, at your loading dock, and uh, I'm sending you the, er, the delivery confirmations now to reference number CNF-445789-WD22.
Customer: Um, so you're saying, like, I've been on the phone for, uh, two hours total today and they're, um, already here?
188. Yeah, so um, the issue was that, uh, because of the residential flag, the system wasn't, er, wasn't linking it to your institutional account properly, which is like... what's the word... a database mismatch thing, but um, I've corrected it now under update code UPD-123477-R.
Customer: Hmm, what if this happens again? I mean, probably will, knowing my luck.
189. Oh! So, um, I'm actually adding a, uh, a special routing note to your account—it's like, er, a VIP flag basically—with code VIP-8834521, and um, I'm also giving you my direct extension which is, uh, 4479, so you can, um, bypass the regular queue entirely.
Customer: Let me see here... okay so that means... yeah, I guess that works.
190. Perfect! And um, just so you know, I've also, uh, credited your account—it's showing as credit CRD-90128-KL—for, er, for all the trouble today, and um, that should appear within, uh, twenty-four to forty-eight hours, okay?
Customer: So basically I just... noticed this charge. Again.
191. Oh! Um, okay so. Let me. Er, pull that up. Just need your account number or, uh, email?
Customer: It's like, basically I set this up and then, so... completely forgot.
192. No worries! That's, um, totally normal actually, so, uh, happens all the time. What email did you, er, use for the account?
Customer: j.martinez at gmail.
193. Perfect. Got it. Um, so I'm seeing here, uh, account ID ACC-7829-MX91. Is that, er, for the premium subscription that started, hmm, back in August?
Customer: Yeah. So basically like, I don't even use it anymore.
194. Completely understand! So, um, that's. That's frustrating. Let me just, uh, check here. Transaction TXN-445821-QR shows, er, three months of charges at $29.99?
Customer: Three months? Do you know how embarrassing this is?
195. Hey. It's okay. Really. Um, so like, this happens more than you'd think, and uh, we can definitely. We can fix this.
Customer: Just cancel it.
196. Absolutely. Canceling now. Done. Um, and so, I'm also seeing here that, er, we can issue a partial refund? For last month's charge under policy POL-8847-C?
Customer: You can refund it? Even though it's like, basically my fault?
197. Um, yes! So basically, uh, since you haven't logged in, er, for over 30 days according to, hmm, let me see... report RPT-2901-K. We can refund October.
Customer: I'm platinum member. Should get all three months back.
198. Oh! Platinum. Let me. Um, so checking your status here, member ID MEM-55492-PL and, uh, you're right. Different policy applies.
Customer: So like, basically what happens now?
199. So, um, processing full refund. All three months. Er, confirmation number is, uh, REF-78823-PLT and you'll see that in, hmm, 3-5 business days.
Customer: That's it? Done?
200. All done! Um, sent confirmation to your email. Receipt RCP-90127-X attached. And, uh, again? Don't feel bad. Happens constantly. You're all set.
Customer: J'appelle à propos d'une charge. Premium monitoring service? J'ai jamais inscrite pour ça.
201. D'accord, euh, laissez-moi juste... trouver ça ici et, euh, je peux définitivement regarder ça pour vous... alors c'est quoi le... hmm... le numéro de compte?
Customer: Le numéro de compte c'est, euh, 4-4-7—non attendez, désolée, 4-7-7-2-9.
202. Bon bon, je l'ai. Alors je vois le compte 4-7-7-2-9 ici et il y a une charge pour... laissez-moi trouver l'exact... okay oui, Premium Monitoring activé le 15 octobre avec code de confirmation PMN-88264-QV.
Customer: Octobre? That's three months of charges. Savez-vous qui je suis?
203. Je comprends que vous êtes frustrée et, euh, je vais... ce que je peux faire c'est... hmm... je dois vérifier la méthode d'activation...
Customer: Je dirige deux compagnies. C'est inacceptable.
204. Alors, euh, selon le système ici, le service était, euh, activé par votre portail en ligne avec, euh, transaction ID TXN-994527361 à 15h47 et il y a une... hmm... comment dire... une signature digitale.
Customer: Signature digitale? J'ai jamais... I just... j'peux même pas...
205. Je vous entends, et même si je peux pas enlever les charges validées... laissez-moi voir quelles alternatives... okay alors je peux soumettre une demande d'audit, case number AUD-7739-RF22, which takes 5-7 business days.
Customer: Cinq à sept... je suis juste tellement... euh, tout est juste... je sais pas...
206. Ou... actually wait, laissez-moi vérifier autre chose ici... je sors vos données d'usage...
Customer: Mon assistante gère ces comptes. Peut-être qu'elle... non, elle ferait pas ça.
207. Okay alors, euh, intéressant... le service de monitoring montre, euh, zéro usage depuis l'activation, genre, no logins, no alerts accessed, nothing... hmm...
Customer: Zéro usage? Pendant trois mois?
208. Exactement. Alors avec zéro usage je peux... euh, laissez-moi vérifier notre politique sur... euh... les services non utilisés... une seconde...
Customer: J'ai besoin que ce soit réglé. Aujourd'hui. Or I'm calling—wait, c'est corporate? Legal? Je suis juste... ugh.
209. Je l'ai trouvée. Alors parce qu'il y a pas d'usage dans le dossier REC-55412-NM, je peux escalader ça à notre équipe de révision de facturation avec priority flag PRI-2847... they can authorize a partial credit.
Customer: Partiel? After charging me for nothing?
210. Alors, euh, voici ce que je fais... j'ajoute des notes à propos du, euh, zéro usage, la confusion sur l'activation, et, euh, je demande une révision complète sous ticket TKT-338856-B qui, hmm, entre vous et moi? Usually gets approved for cases like this.
Customer: Bon alors. Euh. Voyons voir... Mon paiement. C'est dû demain? Et je peux juste. Pas le faire.
211. Ah ouais, alors genre, je comprends totalement ça – ça m'arrive aussi en fait, euh, justement le mois dernier avec mon paiement auto. Alors en gros laisse-moi, euh, sortir votre dossier là et, hmm, c'est quoi votre numéro de compte?
Customer: Euh, c'est... hmm, et si j'ai pas... Oh attends. 447-29-8841.
212. C'est noté c'est noté.
Customer: Alors vous pouvez. Vraiment faire ça? Vous êtes sûre?
213. Ouais alors, euh, je regarde le compte ACC-447298841 là et, euh, bonne nouvelle en fait – vous avez jamais demandé de report avant donc genre, on peut carrément s'arranger avec vous pour ça.
Customer: Hmm, d'accord alors ça veut dire... Quoi. Combien de temps?
214. Alors normalement, euh, on peut faire genre sept à dix jours, mais euh, voilà le truc – je vois que vous êtes avec nous depuis, hmm, trois ans? Jamais manqué avant? Donc je vais, euh, vous mettre quatorze jours si ça vous aide.
Customer: Attends. Vraiment? Euh. Vous êtes... vous êtes sûre que c'est autorisé?
215. Franchement? Genre ma manager m'a fait pareil quand je traversais des trucs, alors, euh, ouais. Le code de report EXT-92847-TMP est, euh, déjà en traitement et en gros vous allez recevoir la confirmation dans genre cinq minutes.
Customer: Voyons voir... alors ça fait. Euh. Le 28 alors?
216. Exactement ça.
Customer: Super. Parfait. Juste... fantastique. Encore un truc à gérer ce mois-là.
217. Alors genre, euh, je sais que c'est stressant mais euh, voilà ce que je me dis toujours – vous avez appelé, vous avez géré, c'est, euh, c'est vraiment responsable en fait? La transaction TXN-884291-EX est réglée et genre, pas de frais de retard ni rien.
Customer: Hmm, et si je... bon alors. Je peux. Mettre un prélèvement automatique? Après ça?
218. Oh absolument, alors euh, c'est vraiment malin ça parce que, euh, comme ça vous avez plus jamais à genre vous soucier des dates. Laissez-moi, hmm, vous envoyer le lien pour le prélèvement auto à, euh, l'email qu'on a dans le dossier là.
Customer: Bien. Sûr. Parce que ça marche. Toujours parfaitement. Jamais de problèmes.
219. Non je veux dire, euh, je vous comprends – genre la technologie quoi? Mais euh, franchement entre nous, ça m'a sauvée tellement de fois. Numéro de référence REF-20847-AP pour les, euh, instructions du prélèvement auto et genre, vous pouvez le programmer pour n'importe quel jour qui vous arrange.
Customer: D'accord alors... euh, ça veut dire. Je suis bonne? Vous êtes sûre? Rien d'autre?
220. Alors en gros ouais, euh, vous êtes totalement réglée – paiement dû le 28 maintenant, la confirmation CON-449281-X devrait arriver dans votre boîte mail, et euh, les infos pour le prélèvement auto arrivent aussi. Genre, vous avez tout géré donc, euh, vraiment plus rien à vous inquiéter maintenant.
Customer: Alors basically, euh, j'appelle pour des frais d'hôtel de, euh, je pense genre il y a trois mois?
221. Oh salut, oui, laisse-moi regarder ça—en fait c'est drôle, ma fille fait partie d'une équipe de voyage alors je comprends totalement la situation des hôtels, ces road trips coûtent cher, right? C'est quoi le numéro de confirmation ou, euh, la date du séjour?
Customer: Euh, alors genre du 15 juin jusqu'au, euh, je pense le 18, et basically on avait toute l'équipe là-bas, tu sais?
222. D'accord, d'accord—alors je vois ici... okay il y a une réservation REF-7823-JM du 15 juin, et on dirait qu'il y a eu des frais accessoires facturés à la chambre, laisse-moi juste... ouais, 342 dollars en frais accessoires en plus du tarif de la chambre.
Customer: Attends, euh, 300? Alors genre, voici le truc, je suis, euh, I'm actually between contracts right now et, euh...
223. Oh merde, je te comprends—le coaching freelance c'est dur, mon beau-frère fait des camps de basketball et c'est soit la fête soit la famine, tu sais? En regardant la ventilation ici, le code de frais INC-4421-A montre 150 pour ce qui semble être du room service, puis il y a INC-4421-B pour 92 dollars marqué comme minibar...
Customer: Mais genre, euh, comment je sais que c'est même réel? Je veux dire, euh, on n'a pas vraiment utilisé le minibar, je pense pas?
224. Ouais non, question totalement légitime—honnêtement, les hôtels sont notoires pour ces trucs, j'ai eu une charge une fois pour un peignoir que j'ai jamais même vu... Laisse-moi creuser plus dans le transaction log TXN-882934-C ici, parfois les descriptions sont fausses ou ils facturent accidentellement la mauvaise chambre.
Customer: Alors basically, euh, ma femme est déjà, euh, elle est genre contrariée par toute cette histoire de budget et, er, je suis juste...
225. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, je comprends. Alors ce que je—laisse-moi juste—en fait, tu sais quoi? Since this is from three months back, je peux enregistrer ça sous le case number DSP-9847-TL comme dispute retardée, which gives us more options to work with.
Customer: Euh, alors genre qu'est-ce que ça veut dire exactement? Je veux dire, euh, ça sonne probablement stupide mais...
226. Non non, pas stupide du tout—basically ça veut dire qu'on peut investiguer même si c'est passé la fenêtre normale de 60 jours, et honnêtement entre toi et moi, le dispute code DSP nous donne beaucoup plus de flexibilité qu'une enquête standard.
Customer: Okay mais, euh, comment je sais que tu n'es pas juste, genre, en train de me dire ce que je veux entendre, tu sais?
227. Fair. Complètement fair. Dis-moi quoi—je vais t'envoyer un email maintenant même, reference number EML-7823-JP, avec le processus exact de dispute et la timeline, et tu vas recevoir une confirmation automatique de notre système, pas de moi, montrant que le case DSP-9847-TL est officiellement ouvert.
Customer: Alors, euh, basically les enfants, euh, ils ont peut-être pris des snacks mais genre, er, 300 dollars worth? Je veux dire...
228. Right? C'est genre—quoi, 40 sacs de chips? Écoute, je vois le pattern code PAT-881 ici qui signale des frais de minibar inhabituellement élevés, ça arrive souvent quand le capteur est déclenché plusieurs fois ou quelqu'un restocke mal...
Customer: Euh, alors genre, je suis supposée croire que ça va vraiment, euh, être réglé? Parce que je veux dire, basically...
229. Ouais, je—écoute, voici ce que je vais faire. Je mets un provisional credit PCT-9923-K pour la moitié du montant maintenant, 171 dollars, pendant qu'on investigate, so at least you've got something back immediately instead of waiting.
Customer: Attends vraiment? Euh, alors genre, c'est, euh, c'est vraiment en train d'arriver? Genre tu n'es pas juste, er...
230. Déjà en traitement—tu vas voir le credit PCT-9923-K dans 24 à 48 heures, et honnêtement, avec ce sensor flag que j'ai mentionné? We'll probably get the rest reversed too, ces affaires-là vont habituellement notre bord quand il y a un pattern.
Customer: Euh, bonjour, je—j'appelle pour une réclamation de garantie ? Je crois que j'ai peut-être mal rempli le formulaire ou quelque chose comme ça.
231. Oh pas de souci du tout. Euh, laissez-moi juste retrouver ça pour vous et, euh, on va régler ça avant qu'il y ait un problème. Est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de réclamation ? Ça commencerait par CLM-
Customer: C'est c'est, euh, CLM-7742... ah non, pardon, ça c'est—c'est l'ancien. Je veux dire CLM-7924-RG.
232. C'est noté.
Customer: Je suis désolée, c'est juste que—j'aurais probablement dû appeler plus tôt mais euh, vous savez, je continuais à me dire que je pouvais gérer ça toute seule.
233. Hé, euh, vous appelez maintenant et c'est ça qui compte. Alors je regarde CLM-7924-RG ici et, euh, je vois que c'est pour des matériaux de toiture, et... hmm, laissez-moi m'assurer qu'on accélère bien le traitement parce que la saison des tempêtes arrive.
Customer: Ouais, c'est—c'est ça qui m'inquiète un peu. La saison des ouragans commence le 1er juin.
234. Exact exact.
Customer: Euh, et genre, j'ai j'ai déjà douze chantiers de prévus et si cette garantie ne... désolée, je dramatise.
235. Non non non, vous ne dramatisez pas du tout. Euh, c'est de votre gagne-pain qu'on parle là. Donc, euh, je vais marquer ça avec le code priorité PRI-8856-STORM et, euh, en gros ça vous met en tête de file...
Customer: Vraiment ? Je veux dire, euh, c'est—vous n'êtes pas obligée de faire ça juste pour moi.
236. En fait, euh, je dois absolument faire ça pour vous. Voyez, votre date de soumission initiale c'était le 15 mars, donc vous êtes largement dans les délais, et euh, avec votre licence d'entrepreneur CON-4429-FL au dossier, vous êtes éligible pour notre service professionnel accéléré que, hmm, franchement quelqu'un aurait dû vous expliquer...
Customer: Oh j'ai—j'ai probablement raté ce mail ou ou quelque chose. C'est ma faute, j'ai été tellement dispersée ces derniers temps.
237. Euh, écoutez, entre gérer les fournisseurs et les clients et la météo... euh, je vais m'assurer que ce soit traité d'ici demain soir. Votre approbation devrait apparaître comme APP-7924-CONFIRMED.
Customer: Demain ? Mais mais je pensais que ça prenait genre deux semaines minimum ? Peut-être que je confonds avec autre chose—
238. Normalement oui, mais euh, voilà ce que je fais—et je documente tout dans la note de dossier CN-58847—je marque ça comme infrastructure critique météo, ce qui, euh, techniquement c'est le cas puisque vous protégez des maisons avant les tempêtes...
Customer: Je veux dire, c'est... mon mon père a perdu son atelier dans l'ouragan Michael. Il a tout perdu. Donc je panique un peu, euh, pour ces trucs-là maintenant.
239. Oh... Euh, je suis vraiment désolée. Ça a dû être... Écoutez, euh, je mets mon poste direct ici—c'est le 4-7-7-2—et s'il y a quoi que ce soit, euh, le moindre retard, vous m'appelez directement et je... je m'en occupe personnellement.
Customer: Vous êtes—je veux dire, merci. Je suis désolée d'être dans cet état pour ça, c'est juste que—j'avais juste besoin que quelqu'un m'écoute vraiment.
240. Euh, hé, vous n'êtes pas dans un sale état, vous êtes préparée. Et, euh, c'est exactement ce dont vos clients ont besoin maintenant. Vérifiez vos mails pour la confirmation EML-7924-SENT dans environ, hmm, cinq minutes, et on va s'assurer que vous soyez prête pour n'importe quelle météo qui arrive.
Customer: Euh, alors j'ai juste... hmm, j'ai acheté quelque chose. Hier. Et, euh, maintenant c'est moins cher ?
241. Oh là, en fait j'ai—attends, laisse-moi juste—ça m'est littéralement arrivé la semaine dernière avec une machine à café, donc je comprends totalement à quel point c'est frustrant de voir le prix baisser juste après.
Customer: Voilà. Exactement. Donc, euh, qu'est-ce qui se passe maintenant ? Genre... vous pouvez, euh, arranger ça ?
242. Absolument, alors euh—laisse-moi juste—bon alors j'ai besoin de, euh, retrouver votre compte ici et, euh, vous avez dit que vous l'avez acheté quand ? Et, euh, vous auriez le numéro de commande par hasard ?
Customer: Hier matin. La commande c'est... attendez je regarde... RCP-44892-L.
243. Parfait, alors je suis—attends, en fait c'est—euh, c'est le numéro de reçu ça ou, euh, parce que j'ai besoin du numéro de commande qui devrait être genre, euh, ORD et puis des chiffres ?
Customer: Ah. D'accord. ORD-77453-MK92.
244. Okay okay, alors, euh, je l'ai ici et, euh, wow vous plaisantiez pas, ça a baissé de, euh, 30 euros aujourd'hui, alors laisse-moi—enfin, je vais—en fait, euh, tu sais quoi ? Je vais traiter ça tout de suite.
Customer: Si facile que ça ? Hmm. C'est quoi le piège ?
245. Non non, euh, y a vraiment pas de piège, enfin—alors le truc c'est que—euh, on a cette politique de protection des prix pendant, euh, sept jours après l'achat, et votre commande ORD-77453-MK92 est, euh, clairement dans cette période, donc c'est vraiment, euh, super simple en fait.
Customer: Okay donc... euh, comment je sais que c'est, euh, vraiment en train de se faire ? Genre... une preuve ?
246. Oh question totalement légitime—alors en fait je suis—je viens de le soumettre, et vous devriez recevoir un email de confirmation dans environ deux minutes avec le numéro de référence ADJ-9982341-C montrant le crédit de 30 euros.
Customer: Deux minutes. D'accord. Je regarde... j'attends.
247. Ouais alors, euh, pendant que ça se traite, je voulais juste—euh, je voulais mentionner, genre, pour la prochaine fois ? Euh, vous pouvez en fait, euh, configurer des alertes de baisse de prix dans votre compte pour pas avoir à, euh, vérifier manuellement.
Customer: Mouais. Peut-être la prochaine fois. S'il y en a une.
248. Je comprends—et euh, franchement ? Genre, j'ai été—euh, enfin, je travaille ici et même moi je me suis fait, euh, avoir par des changements de prix avant, donc je comprends totalement pourquoi vous seriez, euh, hésitante à faire confiance au système.
Customer: J'ai reçu l'email. ADJ-9982341-C. Donc... trois à cinq jours ?
249. Voilà voilà, alors euh, le traitement standard c'est, euh, trois à cinq mais—bon alors, euh, entre nous ? Ça passe généralement, euh, en genre, euh, 24 heures, ils disent juste plus long pour être sûrs.
Customer: Hmm. Okay. J'imagine que c'est... réglé alors.
250. C'est ça, ouais—et puis, j'ai ajouté une note sur votre compte à ce sujet, donc s'il y a un problème—ce qui n'arrivera pas—mais s'il y en a un, mentionnez juste le numéro de dossier CSE-108847-P et n'importe quel agent pourra voir exactement ce qu'on a fait aujourd'hui.
Customer: J'ai reçu. Un appel. De votre société. Soi-disant.
251. Ah, je vais carrément vous aider à vérifier ça—laissez-moi sortir notre journal d'appels sortants pour aujourd'hui, j'ai juste besoin de votre numéro pour vérifier ce qui s'est passé.
Customer: Cinq cinq cinq. Huit neuf. Quatre sept.
252. C'est noté, et je vois... hmm, aucun appel de notre part aujourd'hui vers ce numéro, mais je pense que ça pourrait être un numéro usurpé—laissez-moi vérifier le journal d'hier aussi, référence REF-2024-89421.
Customer: Donc quelqu'un. Se fait passer. Pour vous?
253. Ouais, sûrement—et écoutez, je vais m'assurer que vous sachiez exactement comment reconnaître nos vrais appels, d'accord? Première chose, on commence toujours par votre numéro de compte ACC-7821-M, on ne demande jamais votre numéro de sécu complet.
Customer: Ils ont demandé ma sécu. Euh. Le numéro complet.
254. Bon ça c'est—c'est clairement pas nous, et là je suis genre inquiète de ce qu'ils ont pu demander d'autre—vous leur avez donné des informations?
Customer: Attendez. Ils ont dit compte. ACC quelque chose. Huit deux?
255. Non non, le vôtre c'est ACC-7821-M, et entre nous? Les arnaqueurs balancent juste des numéros au hasard en espérant que vous mordrez—ils ont sûrement dit huit-deux-machin pour faire officiel.
Customer: Huit deux un? Ou sept huit? Je suis. Perdue là.
256. Sept-huit-deux-un, ACC-7821-M, et je vais mettre un signal de sécurité sur votre compte maintenant avec le code SEC-90142 pour que personne ne puisse accéder à quoi que ce soit sans vérification supplémentaire.
Customer: Bien. Parfait. Qu'est-ce qu'ils voulaient d'autre alors?
257. Ben je peux pas savoir exactement ce qu'ils ont demandé, mais je pense qu'ils ont sûrement voulu des mots de passe, des cartes de crédit peut-être—les trucs habituels—et je vais vous envoyer notre guide anti-fraude FRD-2024-067 tout de suite.
Customer: Carte de crédit. Euh. Oui. Ils ont demandé ça.
258. Bon écoutez—et là je dépasse genre un peu le protocole—mais je vais vous transférer direct à notre équipe fraude, vous passerez devant tout le monde avec le code priorité PRI-88723, ils vont tout bloquer immédiatement.
Customer: Priorité. Huit sept. Non attendez. Huit huit?
259. Huit-huit-sept-deux-trois, PRI-88723, et franchement? Dites-leur juste que c'est Sarah qui vous envoie—ils vont sûrement super bien s'occuper de vous, s'assurer qu'il ne vous arrive rien.
Customer: Sarah. Bien. Transférez-moi. Maintenant.
260. Je transfère tout de suite, et souvenez-vous—numéro de référence REF-2024-89421 pour cet appel, et j'ai déjà tout signalé donc ils verront—vous allez être totalement protégée, je vous promets.
Customer: Merci. Enfin. Quelqu'un qui décroche. J'arrive pas à mettre à jour mes infos de paiement.
261. Euh, d'accord alors, euh, laissez-moi juste... Je vais vous arranger ça, enfin, ça devrait pas arriver. Vous pouvez, euh, me donner l'email de votre compte pour que je puisse, euh, accéder à votre profil ? Je vois beaucoup de problèmes de paiement aujourd'hui avec, heu, les codes de statut de compte PYM-8827-QA.
Customer: Oui, euh, c'est sarahk.writes arobase gmail. Vraiment merci pour ça.
262. C'est noté. D'accord. Alors.
Customer: Le site juste. Se fige. À chaque fois.
263. Oui alors, euh, je regarde votre compte USR-9042-KLW et, euh, oui je vois exactement ce qui... c'est genre... hmm, il y a ce flag bizarre sur votre module de paiement. Euh, sûrement à cause de la mise à jour système. Mais non. On va régler ça. Maintenant.
Customer: Heu, vous pouvez vraiment le réparer ? Aujourd'hui ? Ce serait génial.
264. Euh, alors voilà ce que je vais, euh, je pense que je peux... laissez-moi essayer quelque chose. Votre token de paiement TKN-5581-BX9 est, euh, genre bloqué dans cette, comment dire, boucle de validation ? Et, euh, techniquement je suis pas censée forcer manuellement mais, heu, vous avez besoin de travailler, non ?
Customer: Oui ! Exactement. Facture à payer demain.
265. D'accord d'accord.
Customer: Euh, sérieusement, vous me sauvez là. Merci.
266. Alors, euh, je suis juste... attendez... en train de contourner la, euh, comment dire... la file de vérification. Votre nouveau ID de paiement sera, heu, PID-7703-MNQ2 et, euh, je suis genre en train de le forcer par le backend. Ça devrait marcher maintenant.
Customer: Attendez. Ça marche ? Ça marche vraiment ?
267. Euh, oui alors, euh, essayez maintenant et, heu, dites-moi ce que vous voyez parce que, hmm, parfois ça prend genre une seconde pour, vous savez, se propager dans le système.
Customer: Oh mon dieu. C'est passé. Enfin !
268. Oui ! Vous voyez ? Euh, je vous avais dit qu'on allait, euh, qu'on allait régler ça. Votre confirmation c'est, heu, CNF-4429-RTK8. Et, euh, gardez-la au cas où, mais vous devriez être, genre, complètement tranquille maintenant.
Customer: C'est. Incroyable. Vous avez réglé le problème.
269. Euh, alors écoutez, euh, si ça arrive encore ? Référencez le ticket, heu, TKT-6801-VMP9. Demandez une escalade. Je mets des notes comme quoi, euh, vous êtes un compte prioritaire parce que, euh, les freelances devraient pas avoir à gérer ça, vous voyez ?
Customer: Heu, wow. Merci. Vraiment. Vous comprenez.
270. Absolument. Euh, c'est pour ça que je suis là, non ? Donc votre numéro de dossier c'est, euh, CSE-3390-QWZ1 si vous avez besoin d'autre chose. Et, heu, bonne chance pour cette facture demain !
Customer: Euh, bonjour, je suis juste—non attendez, j'appelle parce que, euh, quelqu'un m'a promis de régler mon compte mais, euh, rien ne s'est passé encore ?
271. Ah ! D'accord d'accord, laissez-moi voir ça, hmm, je suis en train d'ouvrir votre compte là et euh je vais vous arranger ça très vite, c'est quoi votre numéro de compte ou de téléphone pour que je puisse, euh, tout retrouver ?
Customer: C'est—attendez que je—555-0147. Je, euh, j'apprécie vraiment que vous regardiez ça.
272. C'est noté c'est noté ! Okay alors, hmm, je vois le compte ACC-4829-BX ici et, euh, oh là là y'a effectivement une note de mardi disant qu'ils annuleraient ces frais, laissez-moi juste, euh, creuser un peu plus pour voir ce qui s'est passé parce que ça aurait déjà dû être fait !
Customer: Oh merci tellement, euh—enfin, ils avaient dit que ce serait retiré et, euh, je suis vraiment reconnaissante que vous vérifiez.
273. Non non, c'est pas normal du tout ça ! Hmm, alors ce que je vois là, euh, l'agent a fait la demande REQ-77541-Q mais, euh, c'est resté bloqué dans le traitement ? C'est super bizarre, attendez je vais juste, okay donc je vais faire passer ça moi-même tout de suite !
Customer: Vous pouvez—attendez, vous pouvez vraiment régler ça ? Euh, c'est tellement utile, je pensais juste, euh, je pensais pas que quelqu'un allait vraiment...
274. Absolument ! Oui oui oui, je suis, euh, déjà dessus, alors genre, hmm, j'annule la demande bloquée et, euh, j'en crée une nouvelle, TKT-93026-AL, et voilà ! Ça devrait être traité dans genre dix minutes maximum !
Customer: Je ne—enfin, euh, si ça marche pas encore je vais juste, euh... je vais juste faire avec.
275. Non non attendez ! Abandonnez pas ! Laissez-moi voir, euh, je rajoute aussi le flag priorité PRI-8847 pour que ça puisse plus se bloquer, et, euh, vous savez quoi ? Je mets mon poste direct 5509 dans vos notes comme ça si quelque chose va pas vous pouvez m'appeler directement !
Customer: Vous me donnez votre—attendez, vraiment ? Euh, c'est incroyablement gentil, je suis juste, euh, merci.
276. Mais bien sûr bien sûr ! Hmm, et en fait, euh, pendant que je vous ai, je vois que ça fait trois ans que vous êtes cliente ? Je vais, euh, ajouter un crédit CRD-2156-X pour le désagrément, vingt dollars, parce que ça n'aurait pas dû arriver !
Customer: Vingt dollars ? J'avais même pas—euh, enfin, c'est vraiment, euh, généreux. Merci beaucoup.
277. Oh oh ! Et, euh, laissez-moi juste confirmer, alors tout est en cours de traitement maintenant sous la référence REF-60923-KLP et, euh, vous devriez recevoir un email dans genre, hmm, cinq minutes avec tous les détails !
Customer: D'accord. Euh, donc je dois juste, euh, attendre l'email alors ?
278. Oui ! Mais mais mais, euh, je reste en ligne pour m'assurer que ça passe ! Hmm, en fait ouais, je vois que le code statut STS-COMPLETE vient d'apparaître donc, euh, ça marche ! Vérifiez vos emails !
Customer: C'est—attendez je l'ai reçu ! Euh, oh mon dieu, vous avez vraiment, euh, tout réglé. J'arrive pas à croire—merci !
279. Yay ! Parfait parfait ! Et et rappelez-vous, euh, vous avez mon poste 5509 si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, et ce crédit devrait apparaître comme TXN-44892-P sur votre prochaine facture !
Customer: Je suis juste—enfin, euh, personne n'a jamais été aussi, euh, serviable avant. Vous êtes géniale.
280. Aww, hmm, c'est trop gentil ! Je fais juste mon travail mais, euh, avec un enthousiasme supplémentaire ! Est-ce qu'il y a, euh, quoi que ce soit d'autre que je peux faire pendant que j'ai tout sous les yeux ?
Customer: Alors genre, j'ai reçu cet email qui dit, euh, en gros qu'vous avez besoin de ma carte de crédit? I think that's probably a scam.
281. Oh je comprends totalement cette inquiétude, euh, laissez-moi juste sortir votre compte ici et, euh, on peut tout vérifier... what's your account number or email address?
Customer: Je veux dire, genre tout le point c'est que je sais pas si vous êtes même vraiment la compagnie.
282. Ouais non, complètement juste, euh, alors voici ce qu'on peut faire... je peux, euh, vérifier des informations que seulement nous aurions, genre votre dernière transaction TXN-445892-YK était le 15 octobre pour 47,23$, does that sound right?
Customer: Euh, peut-être? Mais genre, les arnaqueurs ont probablement ça aussi, alors...
283. Vous savez quoi, euh, j'ai eu exactement la même chose arriver à ma mère le mois dernier... someone pretending to be her bank and, euh, it's scary stuff so I totally get why you're being careful here.
Customer: Alors en gros comment je sais que c'est, genre, vraiment vous autres?
284. Bon bon, euh, alors ce que je peux faire c'est, euh, vous donner notre code de vérification VRF-8829-QM12 et vous pouvez raccrocher, appeler le numéro sur notre site web officiel, et, euh, leur donner ce code pour confirmer que cette conversation est légitime...
Customer: C'est ce que la dernière personne a dit aussi, je pense.
285. Hmm, okay alors, euh, laissez-moi réfléchir... actually, you could also just log into your account online while we're talking, et je peux, euh, envoyer un message sécurisé là avec le numéro de référence REF-7736-PL?
Customer: Euh, alors genre, attendez... j'essaie de me connecter mais, euh, ça marche pas.
286. Compris.
Customer: Savez-vous qui je suis? I've been a premium member for like, probably eight years.
287. Je peux voir ça, oui, euh, premium depuis 2016 en fait... compte PRE-00847-ZN... et, euh, pendant que vous vous connectez, juste pour que vous sachiez, on demanderait jamais votre numéro de carte complet par email, only the last four digits for verification...
Customer: Alors en gros ça dit que mon mot de passe est mauvais mais, euh, je sais qu'il l'est pas.
288. Euh, okay alors c'est... laissez-moi vérifier s'il y a, euh, des verrous de sécurité... sometimes if someone tries to access... hmm, ouais je vois 3 tentatives échouées d'une adresse IP différente ce matin...
Customer: Attendez, quoi? Alors genre, quelqu'un EST en train d'essayer de m'arnaquer?
289. En regardant ça, euh, ouais quelqu'un a définitivement essayé d'entrer dans votre compte vers, euh, 9h47 ce matin d'une IP qui n'est pas la vôtre... but the system blocked them, alors, euh, votre compte est sécurisé, juste verrouillé par précaution.
Customer: Je veux dire, j'ai genre besoin de ça réglé maintenant, like, can you escalate this or something?
290. Absolument, euh, alors je vais, euh, le déverrouiller maintenant avec le code temporaire TMP-9903-BK22, et euh, honnêtement? I'd also set up two-factor authentication while you're in there... ça prend genre 30 secondes et, euh, ça empêche ces trucs... voilà, vous devriez pouvoir vous connecter maintenant.
Customer: Euh, bonjour, alors j'appelle pour, euh, comment dire... le remboursement ? Pour mon personnel ?
291. Bon. D'accord. Alors attendez—en fait non—je suis en train d'ouvrir le portail de remboursement là. C'est quoi votre matricule pour que je—non, on va régler ça pour vous.
Customer: C'est, euh, probablement genre E-4-4-7-8-9 ? Je crois ? Peut-être ?
292. E44789, c'est noté. Okay alors je vois... hmm. Votre compte affiche un statut en attente depuis—attendez, depuis octobre ? C'est pas normal ça. Je vais regarder la demande numéro CLM-99204-TRE parce que ça devrait pas prendre trois mois.
Customer: Voilà ! Euh, exactement, donc genre, j'ai tout soumis, euh, le 10 octobre, et puis, euh, rien ne s'est passé, vous voyez ?
293. Non non non. C'est—attendez—c'est inadmissible. Votre dossier de documents DPC-88516-A apparaît comme reçu et complet. Les RH ont signé. Les Affaires Académiques ont signé. Alors pourquoi est-ce que les Finances sont juste... en train de faire du sur-place ?
Customer: Voilà c'est, euh, c'est ce que j'arrête pas de demander ! Désolée, je—*petit rire nerveux*—c'est un peu ridicule, non ?
294. Ne vous excusez pas. Vous avez raison d'être—en fait, j'escalade ça. Tout de suite. Le dossier ESC-70923-B est en cours de création et je le marque prioritaire parce que trois mois pour un remboursement de frais de scolarité, c'est absolument pas notre standard.
Customer: Euh, oh wow, enfin, euh, je veux pas causer de problèmes ou quoi que ce soit...
295. Vous causez pas—non, écoutez. Les fonds de développement du corps enseignant sont... ils sont faits pour être utilisés. Pas pour être pris en otage. Votre soumission SUB-44789-OCT montre que vous avez suivi absolument tous les protocoles. C'est notre échec. Pas le vôtre.
Customer: C'est juste que, euh, peut-être j'ai mal rempli quelque chose ? J'ai tendance à, euh, trop réfléchir avec ces formulaires ?
296. Que ce soit clair. Le formulaire TRF-2023-Q4 que vous avez soumis ? Parfait. Chaque champ. Chaque signature. Même la pièce jointe ATT-6B avec votre syllabus de l'université. Rien à redire.
Customer: Oh. Euh. C'est... ah bon. Désolée, je suis probablement, genre, trop intense avec toute cette histoire ?
297. Arrêtez. De vous excuser. En fait—attendez—je vois quelque chose dans le système. La note NTE-55412 dit "en attente d'approbation secondaire" mais... mais vous l'avez déjà. Depuis le 15 octobre.
Customer: Oui je, euh, Dr Mills l'a signée ? Genre immédiatement en fait ?
298. Exact exact. Donc c'est juste... bloqué. Dans une espèce de boucle administrative. Mais voilà ce que je—non attendez—voilà ce qu'on fait. Le code override OVR-30019-XM me permet de contourner ce flag d'approbation secondaire vu qu'elle est déjà là.
Customer: Euh, vous pouvez, euh, vous pouvez faire ça ? C'est, genre, autorisé ?
299. Absolument autorisé. Quand le système foire, on répare. Et... voilà. L'autorisation de paiement PAY-78823-EDU est maintenant active. Ça devrait être traité dans les... 48 heures. 72 maximum.
Customer: Oh mon dieu, euh, merci ? Je suis désolée d'avoir été si, euh, dispersée et probablement agaçante ?
300. Vous avez été patiente. Méthodique. Claire. Tout ce qu'une conseillère académique devrait être quand notre service financier fait n'importe quoi. Vérifiez vos emails pour la confirmation CNF-44789-COMPLETE, et si c'est pas sur votre compte d'ici vendredi ? Appelez-moi directement. Poste 4-5-5-2.
Customer: Um, yeah, got charged twice for, uh, roadside service. J'ai déjà payé ça.
301. Oh! Um, I'm so—let me just—sorry about that, uh, double charge situation, laisse-moi juste consulter votre compte ici et, hmm, c'est quoi votre—attendez en fait, j'ai besoin de votre ID membre d'abord, vous l'avez sous la main?
Customer: It's prob'ly BK-4428 or somethin' like that.
302. Okay so, um, BK-4428-TW, got it, et je vois ici qu'il y a, hmm, deux charges de 89.99$ le 15 octobre, les IDs de transaction sont TXN-7739901 et, euh, TXN-7739944, ce qui est—ouais c'est définitivement pas normal.
Customer: That's what I'm sayin'. J'ai déjà réglé ça le mois dernier.
303. Right right, um, so here's what—no wait, let me just—okay so I see a, uh, credit was issued, mais ensuite c'est comme... hmm, comment dire... ça a été annulé? Le 2 novembre sous la référence REF-8827-QM.
Customer: Um, I don't know, je pense que, euh, quelqu'un m'a dit que c'était réglé.
304. I'm really sorry about—wait actually, oh! Je vois ce qui s'est passé! Le système a marqué votre code de compte ACC-4428-TW91 comme commercial mais vous êtes enregistrée comme particulier, alors quand le cycle de facturation s'est réinitialisé, ça a automatiquement réappliqué la charge!
Customer: Uh, well I mean, sort of both? Dépanneuse, euh, véhicule personnel aussi.
305. Got it got it.
Customer: So can you, um, just fix it? Genre, euh, j'ai besoin que ce soit réglé.
306. Absolutely, so what I'm—um, let me just—I'm processing a full refund right now, euh, le numéro de confirmation sera CNF-9901-XK, et j'suis aussi, hmm, en train de mettre à jour votre classification de compte en usage-hybride ce qui devrait empêcher que ça se reproduise.
Customer: 'Bout time. Est-ce que j'ai droit à quelque chose pour le dérangement?
307. Actually—and I'm, um, really sorry again about all this—je suis en train d'ajouter un crédit de courtoisie de 25$ à votre compte, ID du crédit CRD-5567-PP, et votre prochain appel de service sera gratuit!
Customer: Hmm, yeah that's, uh, that's pretty fair I guess. Euh, j'apprécie ça.
308. Oh! Also—wait this is good—I just noticed you've been with us eight years under member ID MBR-4428-LEGACY, alors je vous fais passer au niveau platine ce qui vous donne la priorité de dispatch!
Customer: Priority dispatch? Ça m'aiderait vraiment beaucoup.
309. Yeah so basically, um, whenever you call in, votre code PRI-4428-GOLD vous met, euh, en haut de la file, et, euh, le temps de réponse moyen passe de 45 minutes à genre 15!
Customer: You know what? T'as vraiment bien réglé ça.
310. Thank you so much for being patient with me! Votre remboursement référence RFD-9901-XK devrait apparaître dans 3 à 5 jours ouvrables, et vos nouveaux avantages platine sont actifs immédiatement!
Customer: Euh, bonjour, j'ai, euh, problème avec le—non attendez, pardon—avec ma facture? C'est, euh, très confus pour moi.
311. Bonjour! Euh, je suis—attendez—je suis contente de vous aider. Alors, on va regarder ça. Ensemble. Étape par étape, d'accord? Euh, pouvez-vous, euh, me donner votre numéro? De compte?
Customer: Oui! Merci beaucoup! C'est, euh... R-K-7... non pardon, K-R-7-3-9? Attendez. K-R-7-9-3-2.
312. D'accord alors, euh, c'est K-R-7-9-3-2, et euh, j'ai—non attendez, je vais juste—parfait! Euh, je le vois. Votre compte. Alors, quelle partie? De la facture. Est, euh, pas claire?
Customer: Le frais. Pour le—pardon, comment je dis—le truc en plus? Pas dans mon forfait.
313. Ah, euh, d'accord! Alors il y a, euh, des frais supplémentaires. Laissez-moi, alors, expliquer chacun. Très clairement. Euh, la ligne TXN-8847-PQ montre, euh, l'itinérance internationale. 22 dollars.
Customer: International? Mais je, euh, je jamais—attendez non, je veux dire—je vais nulle part! C'est pas correct!
314. Je comprends. Vérifions. Quand exactement. Alors le 15 octobre. Votre téléphone. S'est connecté. À une antenne canadienne?
Customer: Canadienne? Mais je, euh, j'habite ici dix ans! Toujours payer! Jamais en retard! C'est, euh, pas juste pour moi!
315. Euh, c'est correct. Vraiment. Alors, parfois les téléphones—attendez—parfois ils se connectent. Accidentellement. Euh, vous êtes près? De la frontière? Du tout?
Customer: Frontière? Non, je suis... attendez. Mon travail. C'est côté nord. Très nord.
316. Ah! Euh, ça explique tout. Alors, euh, votre téléphone—il a probablement juste—alors, capté une antenne. Par erreur. Euh, ça arrive tout le temps. Très courant.
Customer: Oh. Alors pas ma... pas ma faute?
317. Non non! Euh, pas du tout. Alors, attendez—je vais—euh, créditer ça. Tout de suite. Numéro de référence, euh, CRD-5509-MZ. Les 22 dollars au complet.
Customer: Vraiment? Oh, euh, vous êtes si gentille! Merci! J'étais si, euh, inquiète parce que je comprends pas—pardon—je comprends pas bien les mots.
318. Votre français. Est excellent! Vraiment. Et euh, j'ai ajouté. Une note. Code de dossier NTE-8823-LP. Pour éviter. Des frais futurs.
Customer: Vous écrivez note? Pour moi? C'est, euh, c'est tellement—personne jamais aide comme ça!
319. Bien sûr! C'est pourquoi. Je suis là. Pour enseigner. Pour expliquer. Tout clairement.
Customer: Je suis si reconnaissante. Vraiment. Dix ans cliente. Finalement quelqu'un... quelqu'un patiente.
320. Euh, merci! Alors, ça veut—c'est vraiment, euh, gentil. Y a-t-il, euh, autre chose? Que je peux, alors, expliquer aujourd'hui? Sur votre compte ACC-7932-KR?
Customer: Alors basically mon compte montre, euh, 0? Genre complètement 0? Ça peut pas—j'avais genre 2000 là-dedans hier!
321. Oh mon dieu, je suis, euh, je suis vraiment désolée d'entendre ça—laisse-moi consulter ton compte tout de suite, peux-tu me donner ton numéro de compte ou le email associé?
Customer: C'est euh, attends, laisse-moi voir ici... j-point-martinez à, euh, à gmail—non désolée, it's actually yahoo.
322. D'accord, yahoo, parfait—okay alors je vois le compte ACC-4492-JM ici, et euh, je suis vraiment désolée mais je dois vérifier quelques trucs parce que c'est, well, this is definitely concerning.
Customer: Attends alors c'est—mon argent est parti? Genre vraiment parti?
323. Non non non, je veux dire, laisse-moi juste, hmm, laisse-moi voir ici... okay alors ton solde actuel montre 0 mais je peux voir l'historique de transaction TRX-8827-QP91 d'hier montrant le solde complet, so something's definitely not right here.
Customer: Okay mais alors basically, euh, où c'est parti alors? Mon loyer est dû, euh, demain matin!
324. Oui oui, je comprends complètement l'urgence—je vois une demande de transfert en attente PTR-0934-XX qui était, euh, initiée à 3h47 ce matin, did you authorize any transfers around that time?
Customer: 3h du matin? Non! J'étais—attends non j'étais endormie!
325. Okay alors, euh, je suis vraiment, vraiment désolée mais on dirait qu'on a affaire à, euh, un accès non autorisé ici—I'm immediately flagging this with security reference SEC-7745-UNA, et on va tout geler maintenant.
Customer: Alors basically quelqu'un a juste, euh, pris tout? Genre tout?
326. Laisse-moi voir ici... le transfert montre un routage vers un compte externe EXT-9902-Z mais—and this is good news—c'est encore dans notre période de sécurité de 24 heures donc on peut l'inverser.
Customer: Attends tu peux? Euh, alors genre, you can actually fix this?
327. Absolument, oui—j'initie l'inversion RVS-3384-JM maintenant et, euh, I know this is scary, mais tes fonds devraient être de retour dans, laisse-moi vérifier... 2 à 4 heures maximum.
Customer: 2 à 4 heures... je veux dire, okay alors c'est, euh, avant le loyer au moins.
328. Ça sera définitivement avant demain matin, et j'ajoute aussi le protocole de sécurité renforcé ESP-6672-A à ton compte which includes two-factor authentication, donc ça peut pas arriver encore.
Customer: Est-ce que je devrais genre, euh, changer mon mot de passe ou, euh, ou quelque chose?
329. Oui, définitivement—après qu'on raccroche, tu vas recevoir un email avec le lien de réinitialisation RST-4419-PWD et, euh, I'd also recommend checking si d'autres comptes partagent ce même mot de passe parce que, well, better safe than sorry.
Customer: Okay alors juste, euh, attendre le email puis vérifier dans genre, quoi, 3 heures?
330. Exactement, 3 heures devrait montrer tout restauré, et tu vas recevoir le numéro de confirmation CNF-8823-COMPLETE quand ça se traite—and again, je suis vraiment, vraiment désolée que ça soit arrivé mais on a la situation en main maintenant.
Character 1: C'est à propos de ma candidature à la Meridian Society?
331. Eh bien, oui, je suis, tu sais, la présidente du comité des adhésions, et euh, nous avons examiné votre candidature pendant les dernières semaines — il y a des, franchement, inquiétudes dont nous devons discuter.
Character 1: Des inquiétudes? Je pensais que mes [joking] références étaient assez impressionnantes pour un club social.
332. Alors, ce n'est pas exactement une question de références, enfin, même si elles comptent — c'est plutôt à propos de, euh, l'adéquation avec nos membres actuels et, en gros, si vous êtes alignée avec nos valeurs et traditions.
Character 1: Je ne, euh, comprends pas ce que vous, genre, voulez vraiment dire ici.
333. Écoutez, plusieurs membres ont [upset] exprimé des réserves concernant vos déclarations publiques sur notre organisation l'année dernière — you called us elitist and out of touch in that campus newspaper interview, vous vous souvenez?
Character 1: C'était pris [frustrated] complètement hors contexte! I was making a broader point about campus culture!
334. Même si c'est vrai, vous devez [shaky voice] comprendre que nos membres valorisent la loyauté et la discrétion — we can't have someone who might publicly criticize us from the inside.
Character 1: Donc vous, hmm, me rejetez parce que j'ai, en fait, exercé mon droit à la liberté d'expression?
335. Ce n'est pas, vous savez, un rejet encore — nous vous donnons, je suppose, une opportunité d'adresser ces préoccupations, même si honnêtement, le vote est prévu pour demain et c'est, genre, pas très favorable.
Character 1: C'est, euh, [slowly] exactement de quoi je, en quelque sorte, parlais dans cet article.
336. Voyez, cette attitude là est partie du problème — vous vous positionnez comme une critique plutôt que quelqu'un qui veut contribuer positivement à notre communauté.
Character 1: Mais je veux, genre, contribuer! Je pense juste, euh, que les organisations saines devraient accueillir différentes perspectives!
337. Oh, nous accueillons absolument, euhh, [excited] la diversité de pensée! C'est juste que, bon, there's a difference between constructive dialogue and public antagonism, vous savez.
Character 1: Je ne suis pas, euh, [stuttering] ant-antagoniste! Je, honnêtement, crois en la transparence et, genre, la responsabilité!
338. Ce sont des valeurs admirables, mais la Meridian Society fonctionne avec succès depuis 127 ans avec notre approche actuelle — we're not looking to be reformed or revolutionized.
Character 1: Donc en gros vous voulez des membres qui vont juste accepter tout?
339. Nous voulons des membres qui comprennent qu'appartenir à quelque chose d'exclusif signifie respecter ses traditions et travailler dans les canaux établis pour tout changement qu'ils voudraient voir.
Character 1: Bien, je vais jouer [over confidently] selon vos règles si c'est ce qu'il faut pour entrer.
340. En fait, c'est, hmm, une autre préoccupation — nous avons besoin d'une adhésion authentique, pas juste, vous savez, quelqu'un qui fait semblant, donc peut-être, vraiment, this isn't the right fit after all.
Character 1: dialogue Character 2 D2: dialogue Character 1 D3: dialogue Character 2 D4: dialogue ...up to D20.
Character 1: dialogue Character 2 D2: dialogue Character 1 D3: dialogue Character 2 D4: dialogue ...up to D20.
Character 1: Salut, alors je sais qu'on avait [cough] ce dîner prévu pour ce soir, mais je vais peut-être devoir annuler.
341. Attends, quoi ? J'ai déjà préparé tous les ingrédients pour huit personnes, et le saumon marine en ce moment même. C'est la troisième fois ce mois-ci que tu me fais ça.
Character 1: Je sais, je sais, c'est juste que ma cousine a décidé de passer à l'improviste et—
342. Ta cousine qui habite à Bordeaux ? Celle qui était soi-disant venue la semaine dernière quand t'as annulé le dîner d'anniversaire ? Allez, sois honnête avec moi là.
Character 1: Okay alors, le truc c'est que, euh, je suis pas vraiment, tu vois, sûre de vouloir recevoir finalement.
343. Oh mais c'est pas— [loudly] Mais tu te fiches de moi là ? J'ai, euh, genre vingt kilos de bouffe, quoi, tout depuis les amuse-bouches jusqu'au soufflé au chocolat que t'avais expressément demandé !
Character 1: Tu peux pas l'utiliser pour un autre client ?
344. C'est pas comme ça que, ben, [bored] ça marche, franchement — tout était, euh, personnalisé selon les restrictions alimentaires de tes invités. Sarah est végane, Tom ne mange pas de gluten, et Marcus est allergique à tout ce qui existe.
Character 1: Écoute, je suis [very sincerely] vraiment, genre, désolée pour ça, je suppose, mais je me sens juste, hmm, pas d'humeur sociale là.
345. Pas d'humeur sociale ? Tu sais, c'est vraiment, genre frustrant quand tu traites mon, euh, gagne-pain comme si c'était jetable.
Character 1: C'est pas— Enfin, c'est injuste, euh, je te paie toujours même quand j'annule, en quelque sorte.
346. L'argent c'est pas, franchement, le seul problème ici — c'est une question de, tu sais, respect pour mon temps et, euh, le fait que j'ai refusé d'autres clients pour toi.
Character 1: Alors, euh, et si on réduisait juste, genre, à peut-être, je sais pas, moi et deux amies ?
347. Réduire ? J'ai déjà [loudly] préparé des plats pour huit personnes ! Je fais quoi avec six portions de bœuf Wellington en trop ? On peut pas décuire la nourriture !
Character 1: Peut-être que tu pourrais, euh, congeler ou, en fait, je sais pas, le vendre à, genre, quelqu'un d'autre ?
348. C'est exactement pour ça que je pense à te lâcher comme cliente. Chaque événement devient cette négociation épuisante où je dois sauver tes changements de dernière minute.
Character 1: Tu vas me lâcher ? Mais ça fait deux ans qu'on travaille ensemble !
349. Ouais, deux ans de, ben, reports constants et, tu vois, moi qui me plie en quatre pendant que tu traites les dîners comme si, hmm, c'était des rendez-vous chez le dentiste facultatifs.
Character 1: Bon, bon, je fais la soirée. Tout le monde peut toujours venir ce soir.
350. Super, sauf que maintenant je dois tout réchauffer et prier pour que le soufflé s'effondre pas complètement. La prochaine fois, on met une politique d'annulation par écrit avec un préavis minimum de 48 heures.
Character 1: Bon, on va commencer cette partie. C'est quoi l'ante?
351. Alors, on commence avec, euh, 50 dollars de buy-in minimum, et les blinds sont à 5 et 10. Les jetons de tout le monde sont comptés et prêts, you've got your stack of 2000 right there in front of you.
Character 1: Attends, euh, 2000? Je pensais qu'on jouait avec, tu sais, des mises plus basses ce soir.
352. C'est juste le compte des jetons, pas des vrais dollars—on joue en mode tournoi ce soir. Ta première carte est le 7 de cœur, and your neighbor gets the king of diamonds.
Character 1: 7 de cœur, c'est pas le pire début.
353. Ta deuxième carte est— [gasp softly] oh là là, c'est le 7 de pique! Paire de 7 d'entrée de jeu, et le pot actuel est déjà à 15 avec les blinds.
Character 1: Hmm, est-ce que je devrais, genre, relancer ou, tu sais, juste suivre? Actually, I guess I'll raise to 40.
354. 40 qui rentrent, et ton adversaire est [bitter] en train de réfléchir sérieusement. Le pot est maintenant à 55, and here comes the flop: dame de cœur, 7 de carreau, 2 de trèfle.
Character 1: Tu viens de dire 7 de carreau?
355. Ça te fait trois 7, [bored] which puts the odds at about 45 to 1. La valeur actuelle du pot est 55, et ton adversaire vient de checker vers toi.
Character 1: Je mise 100.
356. 100 dans le pot, [whispering loudly] et, bon, ton adversaire est, hmm, vraiment en train de transpirer là—le pot est à 155. Mais elle suit quand même, so here comes the turn card: valet de trèfle.
Character 1: Toujours rien d'inquiétant. Je mise 200.
357. 200 de plus, donc, le pot monte à, euh, 355 maintenant, basically a massive pot for this early in the game. Ton adversaire est en train de tanker, elle compte ses jetons—elle a environ 1400 qui lui restent.
Character 1: Elle réfléchit vraiment sur ce coup-là.
358. Elle pousse all-in, en fait, [very meekly] ce qui veut dire, euh, encore 1400 dans le pot, et ça fait, euh, 1755 au total. You'd need to call 1200 to stay in.
Character 1: All-in? Avec mon brelan de 7? Je suis!
359. Les cartes se retournent et— [cry loudly] oh non, elle a une paire de dames! C'est un brelan supérieur, which gives them a 96% chance to win with just the river card left.
Character 1: Attends, genre, une paire de dames servie? Mais je l'ai pas, tu sais, vue venir du tout, honestly.
360. La river est le 3 de cœur, [shouting] et la paire de dames l'emporte! Le pot final de 2955 va à ton adversaire, leaving you with just 50 in chips for the rebuy.
Character 1: So I'm thinking about [very quickly] doing that open mic night next week. What do you think?
361. Open mic nights are [laugh hard] brutal, honestly. You're basically throwing yourself to the wolves—drunk crowds, hecklers, people who'd rather be on their phones than watching you struggle through your set.
Character 1: Come on, it can't be that bad. I've been practicing my material.
362. Practicing is, well, one thing, but actually, you know, performing is completely different, I mean, when you're up there alone. The lights make you sweat, your voice cracks, and suddenly every joke you thought was funny falls completely flat.
Character 1: You're being really negative about this.
363. Just being realistic—ninety percent of first-timers bomb completely. The silence after a failed punchline is devastating, and trust me, it stays with you for weeks afterward, replaying in your mind.
Character 1: Have you done open mic before?
364. Three times, and, uh, each one was worse than the last, honestly, like the audience could smell my fear or something. The worst part is watching other performers kill it while you're sitting there knowing you're about to die up there.
Character 1: Maybe I should, um, start with something smaller, you know, like performing for friends first?
365. Friends lie to you [apologetic] though, they'll say you're funny even when you're not. At least strangers give you honest feedback through their complete indifference or worse, their visible discomfort.
Character 1: You're really selling me on this experience.
366. Look, I'm not trying [very loudly] to crush your dreams here! It's just that solo performance is incredibly isolating—you're completely exposed up there with nowhere to hide when things go wrong.
Character 1: Well, I guess, what if I, er, just try it once and, basically, see how it goes?
367. Sure, try it once, but prepare for the emotional hangover. Most people quit after their first attempt because the rejection feels so personal—it's not like bombing in a group where you can share the blame.
Character 1: Do you, hmm, regret doing it, actually, even though it went badly?
368. Regret is a strong word, but I definitely wish I'd had realistic expectations. The fantasy of being discovered or getting big laughs is so far from the reality of stumbling through five minutes while people order drinks.
Character 1: So, like, should I just, you know, not do it then, I mean, based on your experience?
369. You'll probably do it anyway despite my warnings. Everyone thinks they'll be different, that their material is stronger, that they won't freeze up—but the stage has a way of humbling everyone equally.
Character 1: I still think I want to [short pause] try it, honestly, even if I, well, bomb completely.
370. Fine, but don't say [stern] I didn't warn you. When you're up there dying, remember this conversation and know that I tried to prepare you for the crushing weight of performing alone.
Character 1: Alors ça fait environ 6 mois que je fais du bug bounty hunting.
371. Oh c'est, euh, fascinant ! J'ai lu des trucs sur les bug bounties mais, tu sais, j'ai jamais rencontré quelqu'un qui en fait vraiment. Comment t'as même commencé avec ça—est-ce qu'il faut, euh, des certifications spécifiques ou une formation ?
Character 1: Pas vraiment, j'ai juste commencé à apprendre toute seule avec des ressources en ligne.
372. C'est tellement, ben, impressionnant que tu sois [very excited] autodidacte ! Je veux dire, la plupart des gens pensent qu'il faudrait des années d'éducation formelle en cybersécurité, but here you are, actually finding real vulnerabilities that companies pay for.
Character 1: Ouais, mon premier paiement c'était seulement 50 dollars mais c'était incroyable comme sensation.
373. 50 dollars pour ta première trouvaille c'est, franchement, plutôt bien—j'ai entendu dire que, genre, certaines personnes passent des mois avant d'avoir quoi que ce soit. C'était quel type de vulnérabilité, si c'est pas indiscret, ou, j'imagine, c'est quelque chose que tu n'es pas censée partager ?
Character 1: C'était, euh, juste un problème basique de cross-site scripting, rien de, tu sais, trop complexe vraiment.
374. Le cross-site scripting semble trompeusement simple mais ça peut mener à des failles de sécurité sérieuses, non ? Je me souviens avoir lu comment les attaquants peuvent voler des cookies de session ou rediriger les utilisateurs vers des sites malveillants through XSS vulnerabilities.
Character 1: Exactement ! La plupart des entreprises prennent le XSS assez au sérieux maintenant.
375. Est-ce que tu as, euh, trouvé des bugs vraiment intéressants depuis, le genre qui, en gros, te font sentir comme une détective ? J'imagine que certaines vulnérabilités doivent être cachées assez profondément dans le code ou, hmm, require creative thinking to discover them.
Character 1: Le mois dernier j'ai trouvé un authentication bypass qui a payé 3000.
376. 3000 dollars pour un seul bug—c'est incroyable ! Les authentication bypasses sont du sérieux parce qu'ils laissent essentiellement les attaquants entrer par la porte principale sans clé, potentially accessing sensitive user data or administrative functions.
Character 1: Ouais, ça m'a pris, ben, environ 2 semaines de tests pour, tu sais, vraiment le trouver et [trailing off] documenter tout correctement...
377. 2 semaines ça semble être un investissement solide pour ce paiement quand même. La partie documentation doit être cruciale—companies probably need clear proof and reproduction steps before they'll acknowledge and pay for a vulnerability report.
Character 1: Les writeups prennent [cough] une éternité parfois, surtout pour les bugs complexes.
378. Je peux imaginer que les writeups sont, en fait, fastidieux—tu es essentiellement en train d'enseigner à quelqu'un d'autre, ben, comment casser leur propre système. Est-ce que tu dois inclure du code proof-of-concept ou, genre, des démonstrations vidéo pour montrer l'exploit en action ?
Character 1: D'habitude les deux, et c'est, euh, un peu [anxious] stressant parce que, euh, tu sais jamais s'ils vont accepter ta soumission.
379. L'incertitude doit être stressante, surtout après avoir investi tant de temps. Est-ce que tu as déjà eu une soumission rejetée alors que tu étais absolument certaine que c'était une vulnérabilité légitime ?
Character 1: Une ou deux fois, mais, honnêtement, parfois je réalise plus tard, je veux dire, pourquoi ils l'ont rejetée.
380. C'est une perspective mature—le rejet pique probablement au début mais devient une opportunité d'apprentissage. Bug bounty seems like this fascinating blend of technical skill, persistence, and understanding how different companies evaluate risk.
Character 1: Alors, euh, j'ai entendu dire que t'es, genre, biologiste marine mais, en fait, tu bosses aussi avec les forces de l'ordre d'une certaine façon ?
381. Ouais, euh, c'est assez dingue—en gros j'aide à enquêter sur les crimes maritimes en, tu vois, analysant les preuves biologiques des scènes de crime océaniques, un peu comme Les Experts mais sous l'eau.
Character 1: Attends, il y a des scènes de crime dans l'océan ?
382. Oh absolument ! Tout, depuis les opérations de pêche illégale jusqu'aux routes de contrebande, et parfois j'aide à identifier des victimes. L'océan raconte des histoires à travers sa biologie si tu sais comment les lire.
Character 1: Comment la biologie aide à attraper les criminels par contre ?
383. Bon, alors, différentes eaux ont, euh, des organismes microscopiques uniques—des diatomées, en gros—qui s'accrochent aux objets, et je peux, franchement, retracer où quelque chose ou quelqu'un est passé.
Character 1: C'est, je veux dire, complètement fascinant. Tu, genre, sors vraiment avec, euh, la Gendarmerie Maritime ou un truc comme ça ?
384. Parfois, ouais ! On monte à bord des navires et je vais, [happy], prélever des échantillons de leur pêche ou, tu vois, vérifier s'il y a des espèces protégées. C'est vraiment beaucoup plus excitant que, ben, le travail de labo habituel.
Character 1: T'as déjà chopé quelqu'un en train de faire un truc vraiment grave ?
385. Oh mec, euh, l'année dernière on a coincé cette, [laugh histerically], opération de prélèvement d'ailerons de requin absolument culottée—ils avaient, genre, des milliers d'ailerons cachés sous des poissons légaux ! Le capitaine a essayé de, en gros, nous convaincre qu'ils étaient "tombés naturellement."
Character 1: Les requins perdent pas leurs ailerons !
386. Exactement ! Mais, hmm, les preuves biologiques vont plus loin—on peut, en quelque sorte, faire des tests ADN pour prouver quelle espèce, et, en fait, même parfois faire correspondre les ailerons à des carcasses spécifiques.
Character 1: C'est comme la police scientifique qui rencontre Le Monde de Nemo.
387. Exactement ! L'autre jour on a, euh, analysé les modèles de croissance des balanes pour, [gasp loudly], prouver qu'un bateau de contrebande était passé dans, franchement, trois zones de pêche illégales différentes en six mois !
Character 1: Attends, donc, les balanes sont, genre, en gros des traceurs GPS naturels ? C'est, euh, absolument dingue.
388. Pratiquement ! Différentes espèces poussent dans, ben, différentes régions, et leurs, tu sais, taux de croissance nous disent le timing. C'est, franchement, comme lire les cernes d'un arbre mais pour les bateaux criminels.
Character 1: Est-ce que les criminels, euh, essaient parfois de, j'imagine, falsifier les preuves biologiques ou, genre, de les nettoyer ?
389. Ils essaient ! Mais, en fait, les organismes microscopiques sont, hmm, pratiquement impossibles à enlever complètement. Même l'eau de Javel laisse, tu vois, des traces qu'on peut détecter avec le bon équipement.
Character 1: Tout ce domaine a l'air absolument incroyable.
390. Ça l'est vraiment ! Je veux dire, un jour j'étudie, euh, la reproduction du corail, le lendemain je, en gros, témoigne sur comment les modèles d'algues prouvent que quelqu'un était, en fait, en train de braconner dans des eaux protégées.
Character 1: Alors, euh, je me disais, [very quietly], tu sais, à propos de ce truc de biologie marine—enfin, comment t'es même entrée là-dedans?
391. Eh bien, j'ai grandi près de la côte et, euh, j'ai passé pratiquement tous les étés dans les bassins de marée. Ma grand-mère, tu sais, m'a appris tous les noms latins pour tout—she was actually this badass oceanographer in the sixties.
Character 1: Ta grand-mère était [stuttering] une—une océanographe dans les années 60? C'est dingue!
392. Oh absolument! Elle était une des [speeding up] genre 12 femmes dans tout son programme et elle a découvert 3 nouvelles espèces de nudibranches. She used to smuggle me onto research vessels when I was eight.
Character 1: Elle te faisait monter clandestinement sur des bateaux? C'est l'histoire de grand-mère la plus rebelle de tous les temps.
393. N'est-ce pas? Alors, elle leur disait que j'étais, hmm, "l'assistante de recherche junior" et, en gros, personne ne posait de questions parce que, well, she was terrifying when crossed.
Character 1: Je l'adore déjà. Est-ce qu'elle t'a, euh, genre, appris à être, en fait, rebelle aussi?
394. Oh complètement—elle disait toujours que les règles sont des suggestions si t'es assez intelligente pour savoir lesquelles comptent. That's probably why I ended up in this weird intersection of science and crime investigation.
Character 1: Dieu merci tu as [relieved] trouvé quelque chose qui utilise les deux côtés. La plupart des gens restent coincés dans des cases.
395. Exactement! Je veux dire, hier j'étais, euh, en train d'analyser le contenu stomacal de thons saisis pour, en gros, prouver qu'ils étaient pêchés dans des eaux protégées—it's like, honestly, detective work meets biology class.
Character 1: Attends attends attends. Tu peux dire, euh, où un poisson a mangé en, bon, regardant son estomac? C'est, vraiment, complètement fou.
396. Ouais! Différentes régions ont, tu sais, des populations de plancton uniques, et, hmm, les trucs partiellement digérés nous disent, en gros, exactement où ils chassaient 48 heures avant la capture.
Character 1: C'est tellement plus cool que [frustrated] ce qu'ils montrent dans ces documentaires nature. Why don't they talk about fish detectives?
397. Exactement!
Character 1: Non mais sérieusement, je [laugh] regarderais en binge une série entière sur la lutte contre le crime océanique.
398. Les histoires que je pourrais te raconter—like this one time we caught poachers because barnacles on their anchor had a rare parasite only found near Madagascar.
Character 1: Arrête. Tu es en train de, genre, me dire que, euh, des parasites sur des balanes, en gros, ont résolu un crime?
399. Ils l'ont absolument fait! Les braconniers ont essayé de prétendre qu'ils [mocking] "n'avaient jamais quitté les eaux locales" mais, euh, ces petits parasites hitchhikers, bon, ont complètement détruit leur alibi au tribunal.
Character 1: Ton boulot est, franchement, le mélange parfait de, tu sais, nerd de science et, euh, rebelle badass.
400. Ha! Bon, ma grand-mère, euh, approuverait certainement—she always said, actually, the best scientists are, you know, the ones who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty catching the bad guys.
Character 1: Alors j'ai vu votre annonce comme quoi vous cherchez quelqu'un d'expérimentée avec les pierres chaudes et le massage des tissus profonds ?
401. Oui ! On élargit notre [cough] menu de soins de luxe le mois prochain et on a besoin de quelqu'un qui comprend vraiment l'aspect technique et toute l'expérience client. Vous avez déjà travaillé avec des pierres de basalte volcanique ?
Character 1: Du basalte volcanique ? Je pensais que c'était juste [confused] des pierres normales chauffées dans l'eau ?
402. Oh non, la composition de la pierre, vous savez, compte énormément—le basalte retient la chaleur, euh, 50% plus longtemps que le granit, et bon, la teneur en minéraux affecte comment l'énergie se transmet aux tissus musculaires.
Character 1: C'est—c'est [stuttering] vachement plus, euh, scientifique que ce que je, en fait, pensais pour du travail en spa.
403. La plupart des gens ne [curious] réalisent pas, mais, hmm, la thérapie spa correcte c'est en gros, vous savez, de l'anatomie appliquée mélangée avec de la physique thermique et une solide compréhension des schémas de drainage lymphatique.
Character 1: Waouh, d'accord, [speeding up] donc c'est, euh, genre des vraies connaissances médicales, pas juste, ben, de la relaxation ?
404. Exactement ! Je veux dire, hier j'ai dû, euh, recalibrer tout notre système de diffusion d'aromathérapie parce que, en gros, le poids moléculaire de l'huile de bergamote ne se dispersait pas correctement dans nos nouvelles salles de soin.
Character 1: Vous calculez, euh, les poids moléculaires pour, vous savez, les huiles de massage ? C'est, franchement, incroyable.
405. C'est crucial pour les taux d'absorption corrects ! Les différentes huiles essentielles pénètrent l'épiderme à des vitesses variables, et si vous les combinez avec des pierres chauffées, il faut tenir compte de la perméabilité accrue.
Character 1: C'est rien à voir avec le spa de jour où ma sœur travaille.
406. On est définitivement plus spécialisées—nos clients incluent des athlètes professionnels et des gens en convalescence post-opératoire, donc tout doit être précisément calibré pour des résultats thérapeutiques, pas juste de la relaxation.
Character 1: Vous avez, genre, besoin d'une vraie formation médicale ou, euh, des certifications pour ce type de, ben, travail avancé ?
407. On exige au moins 1000 heures de formation documentée, plus des certifications spécialisées en thérapie neuromusculaire et techniques de relâchement myofascial, et idéalement une formation en médecine sportive ou kinésithérapie.
Character 1: C'est, euh, plus de formation que ce que je, en fait, pensais—ça ressemble presque à, vous savez, embaucher une infirmière.
408. L'assurance responsabilité civile seule, hmm, nous coûte 40 000 euros par an parce que, bon, on fait du vrai travail thérapeutique qui, en gros, frôle le traitement médical.
Character 1: 40 000 juste pour l'assurance ? Je veux dire, c'est, euh, plus que ce que certaines personnes, en fait, gagnent en un an.
409. C'est pour ça qu'on paie nos thérapeutes entre 80 et 120 euros de l'heure, selon leurs spécialisations—on peut pas s'attendre à une expertise de niveau médical aux prix du salaire minimum.
Character 1: Donc ce poste, [long pause] franchement, c'est, euh, en gros comme être, vous savez, prestataire médicale ?
410. Pratiquement ! On a besoin de quelqu'un qui, euh, comprend qu'elle fait, bon, essentiellement des interventions thérapeutiques qui, en fait, demandent la même précision que n'importe quelle procédure clinique.
Character 1: Hey, I heard you handle the database architecture for our B2C sales platform?
411. Yeah, so, I manage the entire, um, transactional data pipeline from our PostgreSQL clusters through, well, the ETL processes that [mumbling] feed into our Snowflake warehouse, basically coordinating with the sales analytics team on query optimization.
Character 1: What exactly does B2C mean in your database context?
412. Business-to-consumer transactions require completely different indexing strategies than B2B—we're talking millions of atomized transactions with high cardinality customer IDs versus thousands of bulk corporate purchases with predictable patterns.
Character 1: I can, er, handle this—it's [over confidently] just, you know, databases and, actually, sales numbers, right?
413. Well, it's more complex—like, our sharded MongoDB instances handle, hmm, real-time inventory decrements while, basically, maintaining ACID compliance across distributed nodes for payment processing.
Character 1: Sharded MongoDB? Um, isn't that, sort of, overkill for, well, just tracking sales?
414. Not when you're, uh, processing forty thousand concurrent transactions during, honestly, peak hours while maintaining, err, sub-millisecond response times for our recommendation engine's collaborative filtering algorithms.
Character 1: Forty thousand concurrent—wait, so, how do you, actually, prevent data corruption with, you know, that much throughput?
415. We use, hmm, two-phase commit protocols with, basically, distributed locks managed through Redis, plus, um, event sourcing patterns that let us rebuild state from our Kafka streams if anything fails.
Character 1: Kafka streams? Er, I thought that was, like, for messaging, not, well, sales data?
416. Every cart modification, product view, and checkout event gets [slurring] published as immutable events, which our Spark clusters process through sliding window aggregations for real-time sales velocity calculations.
Character 1: [gasp softly] You're processing individual product views as database events?
417. [shy] We have to track everything for our machine learning pipelines—the TensorFlow models need granular clickstream data to predict conversion probability and optimize dynamic pricing strategies in real-time.
Character 1: Dynamic pricing? So, like, the database is, um, actually changing prices based on, er, customer behavior?
418. The pricing engine pulls from seventeen different data sources including competitor APIs, inventory levels, historical elasticity curves, and even weather data to adjust margins within predetermined business rules.
Character 1: Weather data affects, uh, B2C sales [high-pitched] pricing? That's, honestly, completely unexpected.
419. Absolutely—umbrella sales spike 340% during rain forecasts, so our predictive models pre-adjust inventory allocation and pricing tiers based on meteorological data feeds integrated directly into our data lake.
Character 1: This is, well, way more sophisticated than I, you know, expected from, basically, online retail.
420. Most people don't, um, realize that modern B2C platforms are, [clearing throat], essentially real-time data processing engines where, actually, the shopping cart is just the UI layer on top of incredibly complex distributed systems.
Character 1: T'es déjà entrée dans un bâtiment abandonné ?
421. Oh là, oui, il y a toute une communauté d'explorateurs urbains qui documentent ces endroits avant qu'ils soient démolis ou rénovés. Les histoires que racontent ces bâtiments sont incroyables.
Character 1: Mais c'est pas illégal ça ?
422. Bon, techniquement c'est, euh, de l'intrusion dans la plupart des cas, mais genre, beaucoup d'explorateurs suivent ce code - ne prendre que des photos, ne laisser que des empreintes, tu vois ? La zone grise légale dépend des panneaux affichés et des lois locales.
Character 1: C'est quoi le truc le plus bizarre que t'as trouvé ?
423. Il y avait cet hôpital psychiatrique des années 60 avec des dossiers de patients encore éparpillés partout, des dessins d'enfants sur les murs, et une salle pleine de fauteuils roulants rouillés disposés en cercle parfait. Quelqu'un était passé après l'abandon.
Character 1: C'est vraiment flippant.
424. Ce qui fait flipper, c'est pas la décrépitude - c'est de trouver des traces de visiteurs récents, des graffitis frais sur de la peinture vieille de plusieurs décennies, des sacs de couchage dans les coins. Tu te rends compte que ces endroits sont pas si abandonnés que ça.
Character 1: Tu y vas seule ?
425. Jamais. Y aller solo c'est chercher les ennuis - effondrement de structure, se perdre, blessures sans personne pour aider. En plus avoir quelqu'un d'autre te garde les pieds sur terre quand l'atmosphère devient trop lourde.
Character 1: J'aurais [animated] beaucoup trop peur des fantômes ou un truc comme ça.
426. Les vrais dangers sont [quickly] en fait, euh, bien plus banals - l'amiante, euh, la peinture au plomb, genre les planchers instables, le tétanos avec le métal rouillé. Même si j'avoue que le poids psychologique de ces espaces peut te jouer des tours.
Character 1: Comment tu trouves ces endroits d'ailleurs ?
427. Alors il y a, enfin, des forums en ligne où les gens partagent des lieux, mais franchement, les meilleures trouvailles viennent juste en roulant dans les zones industrielles, genre, en cherchant des clôtures envahies par la végétation et, bon, des fenêtres barricadées.
Character 1: Le truc c'est que, euh, je suis curieuse mais, tu sais, aussi terrifiée.
428. Écoute, euh, commencer par quelque chose de petit comme une maison abandonnée c'est, en fait, bien moins intimidant que de se lancer dans une immense usine ou un complexe hospitalier, je pense.
Character 1: Et les caméras de sécurité ou les gardiens ?
429. Hmm, la plupart des endroits vraiment abandonnés peuvent pas se payer de sécurité, mais, enfin, certains ont des détecteurs de mouvement ou, genre, des patrouilles périodiques, donc faut faire du repérage d'abord, tu vois ?
Character 1: C'est juste que, bon, les photos sont tellement belles mais, euh, aussi tellement tristes.
430. C'est, euh, exactement ce qui attire les gens - cette collision entre décadence et beauté, où, genre, la nature reprend ses droits sur les espaces humains et, franchement, chaque mur qui s'écaille raconte une histoire sur l'impermanence, tu sais ?
Character 1: Alors, je réfléchis à m'inscrire à ce programme de certification en leadership. Tu as fait des formations professionnelles récemment ?
431. Ben, j'ai fait ce, euh, cours de gestion de projet le trimestre dernier, mais franchement, c'était des trucs basiques que je connaissais déjà. L'entreprise a payé par contre, donc, tu sais, je me suis dit autant profiter du budget tant qu'il est là.
Character 1: C'était, genre, valable comme investissement de temps, ou, euh, juste une case à cocher pour les RH ?
432. C'est juste que la plupart de ces programmes sont, hmm, vraiment génériques—ils t'enseignent des frameworks comme l'analyse SWOT que, je veux dire, tout le monde connaît déjà. Mais bon, ça fait bien sur l'évaluation annuelle, et ma manager avait l'air contente que j'aie fait quelque chose.
Character 1: Celui sur le leadership [gasp] a l'air plus concret avec de vraies études de cas et des composantes de mentorat.
433. Ouais, j'en ai entendu parler, justement, mais le truc c'est que, six mois c'est un énorme engagement pour quelque chose qui, ben, ne se traduira peut-être pas en promotion réelle. Ma collègue l'a fait l'année dernière et elle est toujours au même poste, juste avec plus de responsabilités maintenant.
Character 1: C'est décourageant. Tu penses qu'une formation professionnelle aide vraiment pour l'évolution de carrière ?
434. Je suppose, [anxious], les certifications techniques peuvent aider si tu, euh, changes de domaine ou négocies ton salaire, mais pour les formations en soft skills ? La plupart des recruteurs se fichent plus de ton expérience réelle que de savoir si tu as complété des modules de leadership en ligne.
Character 1: Alors, qu'est-ce que tu, en gros, recommanderais de faire au lieu de, tu sais, programmes formels ?
435. Les événements de networking sont probablement plus utiles, si je suis honnête. Tu rencontres des gens qui peuvent vraiment te recommander pour des postes plutôt que de juste collectionner des certificats qui restent sur ton profil LinkedIn.
Character 1: Mais certaines entreprises n'exigent pas certaines certifications pour les postes seniors ?
436. Bien sûr, dans, euh, les secteurs réglementés [groan] ou les postes techniques, mais genre, pour le management général ? C'est surtout du cinéma—les entreprises disent qu'elles valorisent la formation continue mais après elles promeuvent ceux qui savent jouer le jeu politique de toute façon.
Character 1: C'est, euh, assez cynique, même si bon, franchement, j'ai vu ça arriver aussi.
437. Me comprends pas mal, [laugh hard], je fais toujours les formations parce que l'éducation gratuite reste de l'éducation gratuite. En plus c'est sympa d'apprendre parfois quelque chose de nouveau, même si 70 pourcent c'est du blabla et des buzzwords.
Character 1: Tu as trouvé des programmes qui étaient vraiment transformateurs ?
438. Le bootcamp en analyse de données était, hmm, vraiment utile parce que j'ai appris Python, ce qui, tu vois, m'a ouvert de nouvelles opportunités de projets. Mais c'est parce que c'était une compétence technique, pas un autre atelier sur l'intelligence émotionnelle ou la pensée stratégique.
Character 1: Peut-être que je devrais me concentrer sur les compétences techniques plutôt que le développement en leadership alors ?
439. Ça dépend de ton parcours professionnel, vraiment. Si tu veux rester opérationnelle, alors oui, les compétences techniques rapportent plus immédiatement que les formations en soft skills que tout le monde prétend offrir mais dont peu ont vraiment besoin.
Character 1: Tu as l'air assez blasée sur toute l'industrie du développement professionnel.
440. Je suis pas [child-like] complètement contre, je pense juste que les gens survendent ces programmes comme des révolutions de carrière. La plupart du temps tu ferais mieux de faire du bon boulot, construire des relations, et apprendre sur le tas plutôt que de courir après les certificats.
Character 1: Je viens d'apprendre que mon film n'a pas été sélectionné pour le festival. Toutes les autres de ma promo ont été prises.
441. Écoute, je comprends parfaitement cette déception. Les refus de festivals, c'est jamais facile, surtout quand tu vois tes collègues être sélectionnées, mais franchement toutes les réalisatrices que je connais ont un tiroir plein de lettres de refus.
Character 1: Mais j'ai bossé, euh, deux fois plus qu'elles, tu sais, et ma photographie était, genre, objectivement meilleure.
442. Ton dévouement se voit vraiment dans ton travail, et, bon, l'excellence technique c'est important, mais les festivals cherchent souvent, je veux dire, des choses différentes—parfois c'est une question de timing ou des thèmes qu'ils mettent en avant cette année, franchement.
Character 1: Alors, qu'est-ce que je suis censée faire maintenant, euh, juste accepter que je suis pas, tu vois, encore assez bonne?
443. Non non, c'est pas du tout ce que ça veut dire! Tu es incroyablement talentueuse, et la décision d'un festival ne définit pas ta valeur en tant que cinéaste ni ne diminue la qualité de ce que tu as créé.
Character 1: Alors pourquoi est-ce que j'arrive, en gros, toujours deuxième, genre, peu importe à quel point je me donne, tu sais?
444. Parfois les réalisatrices qui ont le plus de succès sont celles qui ont mis le plus de temps à percer. La persévérance combinée à ton esprit de compétition, c'est vraiment une combinaison puissante qui va bien te servir dans ce milieu.
Character 1: Tu [whispering] crois vraiment ça, ou tu essaies juste de me remonter le moral?
445. Je le crois sincèrement parce que je suis [regretful] passée par là moi-même, en perdant des opportunités que je voulais désespérément. Mais ces échecs m'ont appris plus que n'importe quel succès précoce aurait pu le faire, et ils ont rendu les victoires tellement plus douces.
Character 1: Combien de temps ça t'a pris pour avoir ta première vraie percée?
446. 7 ans de refus après refus, mais pendant ce temps je développais mes compétences, je me faisais des contacts, et je trouvais ma voix unique. Le voyage te façonne autant que la destination.
Character 1: 7 ans? Je peux pas imaginer attendre aussi longtemps.
447. Ta motivation est vraiment un atout, sincèrement. Cet esprit de compétition va te pousser à continuer à t'améliorer et à innover, et c'est exactement ce dont cette industrie a besoin de voix nouvelles comme la tienne.
Character 1: Peut-être que je devrais, euh, essayer un genre différent ou, en fait, changer toute mon approche, j'imagine?
448. Tu peux explorer de nouvelles choses si tu veux, mais n'abandonne pas [monotone] ce qui rend ton travail spécial. Ton style actuel a de la valeur, et l'authenticité gagne toujours sur le fait d'essayer d'être quelqu'un qu'on n'est pas.
Character 1: C'est juste que, bon, regarder tout le monde faire la fête pendant que je suis, genre, assise là toute seule vraiment, euhh, ça pique.
449. Ce sentiment est tellement légitime, et c'est okay de rester un peu avec cette déception. Rappelle-toi juste que ton parcours t'appartient, et comparer les chronologies mène rarement à quelque chose de productif ou de paisible.
Character 1: Je sais que tu as raison, mais, hmm, j'ai quand même [sad] l'impression de prendre du retard, tu sais, constamment.
450. Tu ne prends pas de retard, tu construis quelque chose qui a du sens à ton propre rythme. Les meilleures réalisatrices que je connais canalisent cette énergie compétitive dans leur art plutôt que dans les comparaisons, et je vois déjà ce potentiel en toi.
Character 1: Alors c'est ta première fois que tu documentes un spectacle burlesque pour tes recherches?
451. Oui, euh, c'est complètement nouveau pour moi, tu sais, et je suis vraiment fascinée par les connexions historiques! This art form has such rich roots in Victorian theater, et le commentaire social que la plupart des gens ne réalisent jamais qu'il existe.
Character 1: Bon, est-ce que tu as eu la chance de, genre, interviewer certains des artistes, je veux dire, avant le spectacle?
452. Oh absolument, euh, j'ai passé 3 heures en coulisses plus tôt, comme, à prendre des notes sur la construction des costumes, and honestly the level of detail is incredible! Chaque placement de strass raconte une histoire, et les artistes ont expliqué comment chaque élément de la sélection musicale à la chorégraphie contient des couches de sens.
Character 1: Tu dois, err, comprendre que ce [stern] n'est pas juste du divertissement, en gros, c'est une forme d'art complexe, je suppose.
453. Je suis complètement [exhausted] d'accord avec cette évaluation, et après les interviews d'aujourd'hui je suis encore plus convaincue! Les exigences physiques seules sont extraordinaires, and the performers train for years, pour maîtriser la combinaison de danse, théâtre, et engagement du public.
Character 1: Alors, sur quel aspect tu te, genre, concentres pour ta recherche, vraiment?
454. Hmm, le truc c'est que j'examine comment le burlesque contemporain récupère et subvertit les récits historiques de genre, de toute façon. The performers are actively rewriting what sensuality and empowerment mean, dans des contextes modernes, ce qui se connecte magnifiquement à mon travail plus large sur les études de performance.
Character 1: Tu as remarqué comment le public réagit différemment que dans le théâtre traditionnel?
455. Absolument, euh, c'est juste que l'énergie interactive ici est différente de tout dans les espaces de performance conventionnels, tu sais! The audience becomes part of the show through their reactions, créant cette boucle de rétroaction incroyable qui façonne chaque performance de manière unique.
Character 1: Ah, tu penses que, peut-être, tes collègues académiques vont prendre cette recherche au sérieux?
456. Au début certains étaient sceptiques, mais la profondeur de l'analyse culturelle possible ici est indéniable! Le burlesque intersecte avec la sociologie, les études de genre, l'histoire de l'art, and even economics, quand tu considères comment ces artistes naviguent en tant qu'entrepreneurs indépendants.
Character 1: Les costumes seuls doivent coûter des milliers.
457. Oh oui, eumm, certains artistes investissent, bon alors, [jealous] plus de 10 000 dollars dans leur garde-robe, en fait! L'économie me fascine parce que ces artistes sont simultanément créateurs, marketeurs, and business owners, gérant chaque aspect de leur entreprise artistique.
Character 1: Qu'est-ce qui t'a le plus surprise pendant tes observations en coulisses?
458. Euh, le sens de la communauté était, honnêtement, au-delà de tout ce à quoi je m'attendais, genre comme une famille choisie! Everyone helps with quick changes, partage des conseils de maquillage, et fournit un soutien émotionnel, créant cet écosystème magnifique d'entraide et de collaboration artistique.
Character 1: Bon, tu prévois de, comme, publier cette recherche bientôt, je suppose?
459. Le printemps prochain, si tout se passe comme prévu avec les critiques de la revue! I'm also hoping to organize a symposium, qui rassemble des artistes et des universitaires pour discuter de l'intersection de la théorie et de la pratique.
Character 1: Ça pourrait vraiment changer la façon dont les gens voient cette forme d'art.
460. C'est exactement mon objectif, combler ce fossé entre le discours académique et l'expérience artistique vécue! These performers deserve recognition, comme les artistes sophistiqués et commentateurs culturels qu'ils sont vraiment.
Character 1: Alors, euh, ça fait combien de temps que tu travailles, tu sais, sur ce prototype de jeu de société, en fait?
461. Bon, ça fait environ, euh, 18 mois maintenant depuis le concept initial, et franchement, les mécaniques ont évolué de façon dramatique! It started as a simple dice roller but now it's this complex engine-building game with multiple victory paths.
Character 1: J'imagine que, genre, les playtests doivent être, euh, assez épuisants à ce stade, non?
462. Oh absolument, le truc c'est qu'on a fait, hmm, plus de 200 sessions, et en gros chacune révèle quelque chose de nouveau! Last week someone discovered a completely broken combo that let them win in 3 turns, so we're back to rebalancing the resource economy.
Character 1: En fait, je me demandais, tu sais, [groan] si tu avais, genre, considéré simplifier les règles plutôt?
463. Euh, on y a pensé, mais voilà le truc, notre public cible veut vraiment cette complexité, en quelque sorte! The hobby gamers we're designing for expect depth and replayability, donc retirer des fonctionnalités aliénerait notre démographie principale.
Character 1: Bon, euh, et la direction artistique, je veux dire, comment ça avance, vraiment?
464. L'artiste vient juste, euh, d'envoyer des maquettes qui sont, [mocking] supposément finales, mais franchement elles ont besoin de révisions majeures, tu sais! The color palette clashes with our tokens, et l'iconographie est tellement petite que les testeurs ne peuvent pas la lire de l'autre côté de la table.
Character 1: Mais le thème lui-même [passionately] résonne parfaitement avec les mécaniques!
465. Oui! Vraiment, cette intégration c'est ce qui, euh, rend ce design spécial, genre, chaque action semble thématiquement appropriée! When you're building your trade empire, les mécaniques de conversion de ressources reflètent parfaitement l'économie réelle des routes commerciales historiques.
Character 1: Donc, en fait, la campagne Kickstarter [cry loudly] est, euh, toujours prévue pour le mois prochain alors?
466. C'est le plan, même si on se dépêche pour finir le livre de règles et créer des vidéos de preview convaincantes! The marketing side is almost more work than the actual game design at this point.
Character 1: Tu as déjà calculé les frais de livraison?
467. Ah, la livraison c'est, en gros, notre plus gros mal de tête en ce moment, en quelque sorte! Les tarifs internationaux ont triplé depuis qu'on a commencé à planifier, donc on, hmm, considère des centres de distribution régionaux pour garder les coûts gérables.
Character 1: Je veux dire, tu pourrais, euh, [whispering loudly] faire un partenariat avec ce distributeur, bon, qu'on a discuté la semaine dernière?
468. En fait, on est en négociations avec eux maintenant, mais le truc c'est que leurs quantités minimales de commande sont, euh, intimidantes! They want us to commit to 5000 units, ce qui veut dire avancer presque 40 000 dollars avant même que la campagne soit lancée.
Character 1: Franchement, toute l'industrie semble, euh, [monotone] assez risquée ces jours-ci, tu sais?
469. C'est vrai alors, les marges sont, genre, [enunciating every word] incroyablement minces, et de toute façon, une mauvaise calculation peut couler ta compagnie! But when a game connects with its audience, le soutien de la communauté et l'épanouissement créatif rendent tout ça valable.
Character 1: Qu'est-ce qui se passe si le Kickstarter n'est pas financé?
470. Bon, on pivotera vers, euh, les ventes directes aux conventions et, en gros, on construira un soutien populaire comme ça! Sometimes slow organic growth creates stronger communities than massive crowdfunding campaigns anyway.
Character 1: Est-ce que t'as pensé à essayer [hesitantly] une température de torréfaction différente pour ces fèves?
471. Oh, en fait, j'ai expérimenté avec, tu sais, des températures plus basses autour de 250 degrés, et, euh, le profil de saveur change complètement! Les fèves développent ces notes fruitées incroyables au lieu des sous-tons de noisette typiques, even though it takes almost twice as long.
Character 1: Ben, peut-être tu pourrais, euh, diviser le lot et, genre, les comparer côte à côte?
472. C'est brillant! Je— je pourrais faire des lots en parallèle et documenter les différences d'acidité et de douceur. The tasting notes would be fascinating to compare.
Character 1: Alors, le processus de tempérage, je veux dire, t'as compris, euh, pourquoi ça continue à se figer sur toi?
473. Honnêtement, je pense que c'est l'humidité dans ma cuisine, tu sais, parce que le chocolat est tellement sensible à l'humidité, et, hmm, même une petite goutte d'eau peut rendre tout le lot granuleux! I've started running a dehumidifier but the results are still inconsistent.
Character 1: Et si tu essayais la méthode d'ensemencement au lieu de— au lieu du tablage?
474. J'ai voulu essayer ça! Adding already-tempered chocolate to help crystallize the batch properly seems way more foolproof than trying to work it on marble.
Character 1: Le pourcentage de beurre de cacao pourrait aussi perturber les choses.
475. Absolument, c'est— attends, c'est probablement ça! Different origins have wildly different fat contents, and I've been treating them all the same way during tempering.
Character 1: T'as vérifié si ton thermomètre est précis?
476. Bon point! Le mien est digital mais je l'ai pas calibré depuis des mois, and even being off by two degrees can completely ruin the crystal structure during tempering.
Character 1: Euh, tu pourrais aussi, genre, essayer d'ajouter un peu de, euh, lécithine pour aider avec la fluidité?
477. Alors oui, j'ai évité les additifs, mais, franchement, une petite quantité de lécithine de tournesol pourrait, euh, résoudre le problème d'épaisseur sans affecter la saveur! Professional chocolatiers use it all the time to improve workability.
Character 1: Ben, le temps de broyage [sniffle] pourrait avoir besoin d'ajustement aussi, je veux dire, pour cette, euh, origine particulière que tu utilises.
478. Oh définitivement, le truc c'est que ces fèves de Madagascar sont, tu sais, tellement plus dures que celles d'Équateur, et, en gros, elles ont besoin d'au moins 12 heures de plus dans le mélangeur! The particle size affects everything from mouthfeel to how well it tempers.
Character 1: Tes moules— ils sont complètement secs avant de verser?
479. Je pensais qu'ils l'étaient, mais [deep pitch] hier j'ai remarqué de la condensation qui se formait quand je les ai sortis du stockage froid! That explains why some bars have those ugly white spots on the surface.
Character 1: Essaie de les réchauffer à température ambiante d'abord, puis— puis les polir avec du coton.
480. Ça fait totalement sens! Le préchauffage empêcherait le choc thermique, and the cotton polishing would give that professional glossy finish I've been struggling to achieve.
Character 1: [hesitant] Vous êtes là devant sa tombe comme si vous, [confused], la connaissiez vraiment mais elle m'a abandonnée quand j'avais, [trembling], trois jours alors je comprends pas pourquoi vous êtes, [bitter], même là.
481. [startled] Oh mon dieu, tu dois être, euh, [shaking], l'enfant de Sarah—enfin, tu as exactement ses yeux et, bon, je m'attendais pas à ce que quelqu'un d'autre vienne aujourd'hui.
Character 1: [defensive] Mes parents adoptifs m'ont parlé de, euh, cet endroit la semaine dernière et je, ben, [searching], je sais même pas pourquoi je suis venue, franchement.
482. [gentle] C'était ma sœur et elle a pensé à toi, [voice breaking], chaque jour après avoir dû t'abandonner à cause du diagnostic de cancer qui est tombé juste après ta, [tears falling], naissance et elle savait qu'elle ne survivrait pas pour t'élever, [whispering], correctement.
Character 1: Personne m'a jamais dit qu'elle était, [stunned], malade—mes parents m'ont juste dit qu'elle était trop jeune et, [angry], qu'elle pouvait pas gérer un bébé ce qui m'a fait sentir que j'étais juste, [crumbling], une erreur qu'elle voulait oublier.
483. [urgent] Non, ma chérie, tu étais l'enfant la plus, [passionate], désirée au monde mais elle était mourante et n'avait aucun soutien familial sauf moi et j'avais seulement, [regretful], seize ans moi-même à l'époque.
Character 1: [disbelief] Donc elle voulait vraiment me garder mais, [processing], m'a abandonnée parce qu'elle me protégeait de la voir, [realization dawning], mourir quand j'étais trop petite pour comprendre ou, [choked up], me souvenir d'elle. [long pause]
484. [soft] Elle a enregistré, euh, des centaines de messages vocaux pour toi que j'ai, ben, [reaching], toujours sur des vieilles cassettes dans une boîte, euh, en espérant qu'un jour tu les voudrais. [sniffles]
Character 1: Tu les as gardés toutes ces, euh, [overwhelmed], années en attendant que je, ben, [hopeful], me montre peut-être un jour?
485. [nodding] Chaque anniversaire je viens ici et je lui raconte, [tearful], comment j'imagine que tu vas—à quoi tu ressembles maintenant, euh, si tu es heureuse, si tu te, [wistful], demandes parfois qui elle était, et là, [breaking], tu es vraiment là.
Character 1: [quiet] Je faisais semblant qu'elle était, euh, une actrice célèbre ou, [embarrassed], quelque chose de glamour qui reviendrait me chercher un jour, tu vois?
486. [bittersweet] Elle était institutrice en maternelle et peignait des, [fond], aquarelles le week-end.
Character 1: [curious] Est-ce qu'elle a peint quelque chose de, [tentative], moi avant de devoir me laisser partir?
487. [emotional] Il y a toute une série de peintures qu'elle appelait, [proud], 'Lettres à Ma Fille' sur lesquelles elle travaillait pendant ses séances de chimio quand elle était trop faible pour te tenir mais pouvait encore, [voice cracking], tenir un pinceau et imaginer ton, [whispering], avenir.
488. [steady] Tu voudrais les, euh, voir—je veux dire, [nervous], elles sont dans mon appartement à vingt minutes d'ici si tu, ben, veux savoir qui elle était vraiment.
Character 1: [determined] J'ai passé seize ans sans rien savoir, [fierce], sans rien de réel sur mes origines alors oui, j'ai besoin de, euh, tout voir, écouter ces cassettes, et peut-être enfin, [awakening], comprendre pourquoi j'ai toujours senti qu'une partie de moi manquait.
Character 1: [wondering] Tu penses qu'elle aurait, [vulnerable], aimé qui je suis devenue sans ses conseils pour me façonner en qui elle, [yearning], imaginait que je serais?
489. [certain] Elle t'aimait complètement avant même que tu puisses, [tender], ouvrir les yeux, alors oui, elle aurait aimé chaque version de toi qui, [smiling through tears], existe ou aurait pu exister.
Character 1: [resolved] Alors on y va.
490. J'ai attendu seize ans pour, euh, [grateful], partager qui elle était avec quelqu'un qui compte vraiment, tu sais? [exhales deeply]
Character 1: Tu n'aurais pas dû venir ici, [raspy], même si j'imagine qu'aucune de nous deux n'a vraiment le choix de l'endroit où elle finit.
491. Je fouille ces ruines depuis, [startled], trente ans et je ne m'attendais jamais à trouver, [cautious], quelque chose qui respire encore ici-bas.
Character 1: [weary] Les pierres me retiennent ici, [labored], depuis bien avant que ton espèce n'apprenne à cartographier les étoiles ou compter les saisons.
492. [trembling] Mon Dieu.
Character 1: [bitter] Bon, euh, j'imagine que tu voudras, euh, documenter cette découverte ou, enfin, appeler tes collègues pour qu'ils viennent contempler le monstre mourant.
493. [quiet] C'était censée être ma dernière expédition avant la retraite, [hesitant], mais te voir ici rend toutes ces années, [thoughtful], disons, incomplètes.
Character 1: [resigned] Tu sais, euh, je terrorisais des villages entiers, [weakening], mais maintenant j'arrive à peine à lever la tête pour, ben, te regarder correctement.
494. [gently] J'ai passé, euh, tant d'années à poursuivre des légendes et, [reflective], tu sais, la plupart des explorateurs ne trouvent jamais, [sad], ce qu'ils cherchent vraiment, de toute façon.
Character 1: [soft] Le truc c'est que, bon, j'ai vu des empires s'élever et, [nostalgic], s'effondrer à travers ces fissures dans la pierre, et, euh, chaque explorateur avant toi cherchait, [trailing off], de l'or ou de la gloire.
495. [curious] Mais tu sens quelque chose de, euh, différent chez moi, enfin, n'est-ce pas ?
Character 1: [whispered] Eh bien, euh, oui.
496. [contemplative] Tu sais, je fuis quelque chose moi aussi, [vulnerable], tout comme tu es prisonnière de quelque chose de plus fort que, ben, ces pierres.
Character 1: [advising] Écoute, petite, le poids des années t'enseigne que, [earnest], la liberté ne consiste pas à libérer le corps, [philosophical], mais à relâcher ce qui enchaîne l'esprit.
497. [understanding] Rester avec toi.
Character 1: [grateful] Je n'ai pas eu de, euh, vraie conversation depuis des siècles, et, bon, il semble approprié que ma dernière soit avec quelqu'un qui comprend l'emprisonnement.
498. [determined] Il y a un vieux rituel dans les journaux de mon grand-père qui pourrait, [hopeful], briser ces pierres de liaison, même si ça demande, [nervous], quelque chose qu'aucune de nous deux ne survivra peut-être.
Character 1: [accepting] Après toutes ces années à être, euh, crainte puis oubliée, il est peut-être, tu sais, temps de choisir comment l'histoire se termine.
499. [resolute] Alors nous affronterons ce qui vient ensemble, [emotional], deux vieilles âmes qui ont passé trop de temps, [voice breaking], à chercher du sens aux mauvais endroits.
Character 1: Peut-être que le vrai trésor n'a jamais été l'or ou la gloire, [peaceful], mais de trouver quelqu'un qui voit au-delà du monstre jusqu'à, [gentle], l'âme en dessous, même si ça arrive à, [fading], la toute fin.
500. [tender] Laisse-moi m'asseoir à tes côtés pendant qu'on attend l'aube, [comforting], parce qu'aucune créature, bête ou humaine, ne devrait affronter son, [solemn], dernier lever de soleil seule. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [shaking] Euh, j'ai découvert quelque chose dans le système de paie aujourd'hui, enfin, des irrégularités qui montrent qu'on a, [breaking], systématiquement sous-payé nos employés avec visa H1-B depuis, bon, ces trois dernières années.
501. Donc tu comprends exactement ce que ça signifie, euh, le poids moral de, [heavy], garder cette information pour toi versus les, [calculating], conséquences pratiques de la signaler, enfin. [sighs]
Character 1: Les données montrent un schéma de, [methodical], 15 à 20 pourcent de vol de salaire affectant plus de, [hollow], 200 employés qui ont fait confiance à cette entreprise pour leur, [cracking], statut d'immigration et leurs moyens de subsistance.
502. [stern] Bon, euh, tu travailles ici depuis 12 ans et, [probing], ta fille vient de commencer l'université avec ce programme d'aide aux frais de scolarité, alors, [measured], réfléchissons à ce qui se passe si tu, [careful], deviens lanceuse d'alerte, tu vois.
Character 1: [defensive] Enfin, j'ai déjà refait les calculs trois fois, bon, j'ai croisé les références avec les standards de l'industrie et, [exhausted], il n'y a aucune explication légitime pour ces écarts. [laughs bitterly]
503. [guiding] Ton versement hypothécaire est dû la semaine prochaine et les, [pointed], factures médicales de Sarah s'accumulent toujours depuis son opération.
Character 1: [frustrated] Ce ne sont pas juste des chiffres sur un tableur pourtant, ce sont, [unraveling], des gens avec des familles qui ont été escroqués de, [bitter], centaines de milliers de dollars collectivement.
504. [logical] La dernière personne qui a signalé une fraude ici a été blacklistée par, [clinical], tous les grands employeurs de la région.
Character 1: [wavering] Mon superviseur m'a demandé de supprimer le rapport que j'ai créé documentant, [trembling], toutes ces irrégularités d'ici demain soir.
505. [pressing] Euh, donc tu as 24 heures pour décider si, [deliberate], tu es la personne qui suit les ordres ou celle qui, [sharp], fait ce qui est juste, enfin, peu importe le coût personnel, tu vois.
Character 1: [whispered] Je sais.
506. [softer] Bon, euh, tu te souviens quand tu as commencé ici et que tu t'es promis de, [nostalgic], jamais devenir une de ces personnes qui détournent le regard, tu vois?
Character 1: [resolute] Euh, je n'arrête pas de penser à Raj de la comptabilité qui, bon, [pained], envoie la moitié de son salaire sous-payé au pays pour soutenir ses parents, enfin.
507. [steering] Alors, euh, la ligne de dénonciation anonyme existe pour une raison, et bon, [strategic], la documentation peut être divulguée sans immédiatement, [cautious], t'impliquer comme source, tu vois.
Character 1: Le bonus du PDG l'année dernière était de 8 millions de dollars alors que, [disgusted], ces travailleurs ne pouvaient pas se payer l'assurance santé pour leurs, [breaking], enfants à cause de ce qu'on leur a, [guilty], volé.
508. [firm] Bon, euh, tu as déjà pris ta décision n'est-ce pas, enfin, [knowing], assise ici à minuit à créer des copies de sauvegarde de tout, [proud], au lieu d'être chez toi avec ta famille, tu vois.
Character 1: Chaque chèque de paie que j'ai déposé ces trois dernières années a été, [haunted], construit sur le vol de gens qui n'avaient aucun, [crumbling], pouvoir de se battre contre un système conçu pour les, [defeated], exploiter. [sighs deeply]
509. [gentle] Demain matin tu seras soit la personne qui, [encouraging], s'est levée soit celle qui est restée silencieuse.
Character 1: [determined] J'envoie les dossiers à l'Inspection du travail ce soir avec, [steady], des copies à trois journalistes qui enquêtent sur le, [building], vol de salaire dans les entreprises tech.
510. Enfin tu deviens la personne que tu as, [proud], toujours prétendu être au lieu de celle qui, [relieved], traite juste des chiffres et fait semblant de ne pas voir. [exhales]
Character 1: [guarded] Bon, euh, je ne prends plus d'apprenties d'habitude, mais, [reluctant], votre lettre de candidature mentionnait quelque chose sur, euh, une tradition familiale qui, [distant], m'a fait reconsidérer, enfin, contre mon meilleur jugement.
511. [eager] Ma mère me disait toujours que la distillation était, [wistful], dans notre sang en quelque sorte, qu'il y avait cette, [searching], dimension artistique qu'elle n'a jamais pu vraiment, [hopeful], explorer avant sa mort.
Character 1: [stiffening] Les alambics en cuivre doivent être, [methodical], nettoyés chaque matin avant même qu'on pense à, [firm], lancer une production. [clears throat]
512. Je suis prête à tout apprendre depuis, [determined], la base, quoi qu'il en coûte.
Character 1: [softer] Votre mère, est-ce qu'elle a vraiment, [careful], travaillé dans la distillation ou c'était juste quelque chose dont elle, [probing], parlait ?
513. Elle a travaillé dans un endroit qui s'appelait la Distillerie Hartwell pendant, [nostalgic], trois ans avant ma naissance, mais il y a eu une sorte d', [hesitant], accident et elle n'y est jamais retournée.
Character 1: [shaken] Hartwell c'était, euh, c'était ma distillerie avant, [voice cracking], avant que j'ouvre celle-ci, et, euh, le nom de votre mère, [trembling], comment s'appelait-elle ?
514. Sarah Chen, et, euh, elle disait toujours que l'accident n'était, [defensive], la faute de personne mais je sentais qu'elle, euh, n'y croyait pas vraiment elle-même.
Character 1: [whispered] L'enfant de, [breaking], Sarah.
515. [confused] Vous la connaissiez alors, je veux dire, vraiment, parce que, euh, la façon dont vous venez de dire son nom on dirait qu'il y a, [realizing], quelque chose de plus que, euh, vous ne me dites pas.
Character 1: [raw] Sarah et moi étions, euh, partenaires dans tous les sens du terme jusqu'à, [guilty], l'explosion de la chaudière qui lui a pris son œil et, ben, a tout fini entre nous parce que, [anguished], j'aurais dû vérifier ces jauges de pression moi-même.
516. [stunned] Alors c'est à cause de vous qu'elle, euh, ne pouvait plus regarder un alambic sans, [angry], tressaillir, qu'elle se réveillait en hurlant à propos de, euh, cuivre et de vapeur.
Character 1: [desperate] Je vis avec cette culpabilité depuis, euh, 23 ans, vérifiant ces jauges, [obsessive], de façon obsessionnelle maintenant, voyant son visage dans chaque, euh, reflet sur le cuivre. [voice breaking]
517. [bitter] Elle ne m'a jamais dit votre nom mais elle disait que, [accusatory], la personne qu'elle aimait le plus était devenue celle qui avait, [cracking], détruit ses rêves.
Character 1: [pleading] Tout ce que j'ai construit ici devait être, [remorseful], notre rêve à nous deux, chaque bouteille que je produis est, [broken], une excuse qu'elle n'entendra jamais, une promesse que je, [weeping], n'ai pas pu tenir.
518. [softer] C'est peut-être pour ça qu'elle m'a envoyée ici, [understanding], à sa manière, à travers ses histoires qui m'ont fait, [tearful], tomber amoureuse de cet art. [long pause]
Character 1: [tender] Si vous êtes prête à apprendre de quelqu'un qui a, [vulnerable], échoué si catastrophiquement avec votre mère, je vous enseignerai tout, [determined], y compris comment ne jamais faire les erreurs qui, [resolved], me hantent.
519. [gentle] Elle vous a pardonné, je crois, parce que, euh, elle a gardé votre première bouteille, celle que vous avez faite, [emotional], ensemble, cachée dans son placard enveloppée dans ce, euh, ruban bleu délavé. [sniffles]
Character 1: [overcome] Le ruban bleu de, euh, notre première victoire en concours, elle l'a, [sobbing], gardé toutes ces années, même après, euh, tout ce que je lui ai pris.
520. [resolute] Alors peut-être qu'il est temps qu'on, euh, finisse ce que vous aviez, [hopeful], commencé toutes les deux.
Character 1: Alors c'est vous qu'on appelle, euh, une arbitre, celle qui, [contemptuous], pense que les ouvriers méritent de négocier avec leurs, [disgusted], dirigeants légitimes, enfin bon, comme si des paysans pouvaient comprendre la gouvernance.
521. [nervous] Votre Majesté, je suis ici parce que les grèves se, [measured], propagent plus vite que vos gardes ne peuvent les réprimer et l'économie du royaume, [careful], commence à s'effondrer. [clears throat]
Character 1: Mon grand-père aurait simplement, [coldly], exécuté un ouvrier sur 10 jusqu'à ce que les autres rentrent dans le, [amused], rang, mais apparemment ces temps modernes exigent des, [mocking], approches plus douces.
522. [steady] Avec tout le respect que je vous dois, exécuter des ouvriers ne rend pas les survivants, [emphatic], plus productifs ou loyaux.
Character 1: [imperious] Loyaux ? Enfin, euh, ils devraient être reconnaissants du, [incredulous], privilège de servir leur royaume, bon, d'avoir un but au-delà de leur, [dismissive], existence insignifiante, vous comprenez ?
523. [diplomatic] Les ouvriers ne demandent pas grand-chose, juste, [earnest], des règles de sécurité élémentaires et un jour de repos par semaine. [sighs quietly]
Character 1: [laughing cruelly] Du repos ? De la sécurité ? Bientôt ils voudront, [sarcastic], des lits confortables et de la viande fraîche !
524. En fait, euh, ils meurent dans les mines à un rythme, [grave], trois fois supérieur aux royaumes voisins, et, bon, les ouvriers morts ne peuvent ni extraire de l'or ni, [pointed], payer d'impôts, enfin, vous comprenez sûrement ça ?
Character 1: [thunderous] Comment osez-vous me faire la leçon sur l', [seething], économie quand j'ai bâti cet empire avec rien d'autre que du, [proud], sang et du fer !
525. [firm] Bon, Votre Majesté, euh, j'essaie de sauver votre empire de l', [urgent], effondrement parce que, vous savez, même les tyrans ont besoin de sujets vivants à gouverner. [pause]
Character 1: [menacing] Euh, vous parlez bien hardiment pour quelqu'un dont la, [dangerous], vie ne tient qu'à mon bon vouloir, enfin. [long pause]
526. [resigned] Tuez-moi alors.
Character 1: [intrigued] Hmm, vous n'avez pas peur ? Bon, euh, la plupart des gens qui entrent dans cette salle du trône, [curious], supplient et rampent avant même que je, [amused], parle, vous savez ? [chuckles darkly]
527. La peur ne résoudra pas votre crise ouvrière ni n'arrêtera la, [blunt], révolution qui a déjà commencé.
Character 1: [calculating] Révolution est un bien grand mot, euh, mais peut-être avez-vous raison concernant la, [reluctant], préservation de ma main-d'œuvre, bon, pour des raisons purement pratiques, vous comprenez ?
528. [hopeful] Alors, euh, vous allez considérer les revendications des ouvriers, je veux dire, les, [encouraging], demandes élémentaires sur la sécurité et le repos, enfin, comme point de départ pour des, [careful], négociations ?
Character 1: [commanding] Je leur accorderai une demi-journée de repos mensuelle et des, [condescending], mesures de sécurité minimales, mais en échange j'exige une, [fierce], obéissance absolue et des quotas doublés.
529. Ce n'est pas une négociation.
Character 1: [quiet rage] C'est la meilleure offre qu'ils obtiendront de quelqu'un qui pourrait les, [ominous], remplacer tous par des prisonniers de guerre demain si je, [casual], décidais d'envahir nos voisins. [exhales slowly]
530. [defeated] Bon, euh, je transmettrai votre offre. [sighs]
Character 1: [tense] Look, I know this is, [uncomfortable], irregular but my own monitoring device started, [panicked], beeping during my shift and I need someone who can, [desperate], examine it without reporting to my department.
531. [curious] Well, um, that's definitely not, [suspicious], something I hear every day—I mean, an officer wearing their own product, so, [cautious], let me take a look at this thing. [exhales]
Character 1: [defensive] I don't know, um, how this happened but, [breaking], three months ago I was told it was, you know, [shaking], deactivated after my own probation ended—I mean, they promised me.
532. [focused] This model was, er, discontinued five years ago because, well, [grim], it kept transmitting even after court orders expired—umm, basically creating permanent surveillance.
Character 1: [bitter] So I've been tracking criminals while being, [hollow], tracked myself like some kind of sick cosmic joke.
533. [discovering] Wait, um, there's something else—this device is, [shocked], broadcasting to two separate frequencies, and, well, one of them isn't, you know, [worried], even registered to law enforcement. [pause]
Character 1: [stunned] You're telling me that someone outside the, [frightened], department has been monitoring every move I make, every, [voice cracking], house I visit for work, every, [trembling], location of every person I supervise?
534. [urgent] I mean, yeah, and, um, whoever's receiving this data has, [disturbed], access to your entire network—er, basically every monitored individual in your, well, caseload.
Character 1: [desperate] Can you trace, um, where the signal's going because, [frantic], I need to know who's been, you know, [breaking], watching me watch them—I mean, this is insane.
535. [working] The coordinates are pointing to, umm, an abandoned warehouse on, [confused], Pier 47 but, well, that's where they used to, [remembering], store decommissioned monitoring equipment before the, you know, budget cuts. [whispers]
Character 1: [determined] I've sent dozens of people there for, [angry], community service thinking it was just, [disgusted], cleaning up old tech, but now I'm wondering what they were, [horrified], actually doing with all that access. [groans]
536. Someone's been, um, building a parallel surveillance network using, [revelation], officers like you as unwitting nodes—I mean, [technical], this code here shows automated collection protocols that, well, [amazed], harvest everything.
Character 1: Every address I've verified, um, every, [sickened], violation I've reported, every person I've sent back to, you know, [defeated], prison—they have it all, don't they? [laughs bitterly]
537. [grim] Based on what I'm seeing here, um, they don't just, [careful], have your data—they've been using it to, well, [measured], predict probation violations before they happen, you know?
Character 1: [whispered] Um, well, shit.
538. [determined] Look, I can disable this thing but, um, whoever's watching will, [warning], know immediately that we've discovered their, [steady], operation—so, err, we need to decide right now if you're ready for whatever comes, well, next.
Character 1: [resolved] Well, um, I've spent three years believing I was, [cynical], keeping people accountable when really, you know, I was just another rat in someone's maze.
539. The signal just spiked which means they're, [alarmed], actively monitoring us right now, probably, [frantic], wondering why you're at a repair shop instead of, [urgent], making your scheduled rounds.
Character 1: [cold] Let them wonder because I'm done being their, [fierce], puppet—cut the signal and let's see who comes, [determined], crawling out of that warehouse to find out why their, [vengeful], pet officer went dark. [exhales sharply]
540. Alright, um, on three then—just, well, know that once I cut this, [grave], there's no going back to your old life.
Character 1: [confused] Les relevés de température de votre chambre froide sont, [suspicious], complètement hors normes et il y a quelque chose qui bloque mon accès à la section du fond.
541. [nervous] C'est juste du vieux matériel qu'on, [defensive], entrepose là-derrière, rien qui intéresserait les services sanitaires ou, [forced calm], qui affecterait notre conformité aux normes d'hygiène en quoi que ce soit. [coughs]
Character 1: [firm] Écoutez, euh, je dois inspecter chaque zone, enfin, qui est reliée au stockage alimentaire, et bon, ce cadenas n'est pas du matériel standard de restaurant.
542. Vous devriez vraiment vous concentrer sur la, [threatening], cuisine principale où la préparation des aliments a vraiment lieu.
Character 1: [alarmed] J'entends quelque chose qui ressemble, euh, à des pleurs étouffés derrière ce mur, et enfin, [shaking], c'est absolument pas normal pour un congélateur de restaurant. [pause]
543. [desperate] Ben, euh, parfois les tuyaux font ces, [fabricating], bruits bizarres quand le compresseur se met en marche, vous savez, des problèmes de vieux bâtiment qu'on a, [sweating], l'intention de réparer depuis des mois.
Character 1: Madame, je veux que vous, euh, ouvriez cette porte immédiatement ou, bon, j'appelle la police tout de suite.
544. [cold] Vous n'avez aucune autorité légale pour exiger, [calculating], quoi que ce soit au-delà des inspections de sécurité alimentaire, et c'est, [menacing], une propriété privée hors de votre juridiction.
Character 1: [determined] Quand je suspecte que la vie de quelqu'un est en, [urgent], danger, mes obligations vont bien au-delà de vérifier les températures des frigos.
545. [panicking] C'est ma fille et c'est une, [breaking], affaire de famille qui n'a rien à voir avec votre, [pleading], stupide inspection de restaurant alors s'il vous plaît laissez-nous tranquilles. [voice cracking]
Character 1: [horrified] Mon Dieu, vous êtes vraiment en train de, euh, garder quelqu'un enfermé là-dedans, enfin, [fumbling], j'appelle le 911 maintenant pendant que, bon, vous feriez mieux de vous expliquer.
546. Vous ne comprenez pas ce qu'elle a, [angry], fait à notre famille en s'enfuyant avec ce monstre.
Character 1: [resolute] Quoi qu'il se soit passé entre vous ne justifie pas, [disgusted], d'emprisonner un être humain dans un congélateur.
547. [defeated] Je voulais juste, euh, lui parler, vous savez, lui faire comprendre pourquoi elle peut pas gâcher sa vie comme ça.
Character 1: La police est déjà en, [steady], route et vous devez me donner cette clé tout de, [commanding], suite avant que ça devienne encore pire que ça ne, [grave], l'est déjà.
548. [broken] J'essayais de la sauver de, [sobbing], faire les mêmes erreurs que sa mère a faites quand elle était jeune, [anguished], avant que tout s'écroule et détruise nos vies complètement.
Character 1: Quelles que soient vos intentions, vous avez, [compassionate], commis un enlèvement et une séquestration, et la seule chose qui pourrait, [serious], vous aider maintenant c'est de coopérer pleinement avant que quelqu'un ne, [worried], soit gravement blessé.
549. [resigned] Voici la clé.
Character 1: [relieved] Restez là pendant que je la sors, [careful], et si elle a besoin de soins médicaux, [tense], vous allez expliquer chaque minute qu'elle a passée là-dedans.
550. [hollow] 26 heures. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [exhausted] You can't just walk in here at, [confused], three in the morning talking about liberation, tu peux pas débarquer ici à 3 heures du matin pour parler de libération quand j'ai, [bitter], encore 7 heures de shift pis des quotas à respecter.
551. [calm] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, your quotas won't matter, ben euh, ce que je veux dire c'est que tes quotas auront plus d'importance quand ils vont, [urgent], fermer tout cet étage la semaine prochaine et genre, remplacer chaque opératrice avec les nouveaux systèmes d'IA qu'elles ont, [quiet], secrètement installés au niveau 3.
Character 1: [defensive] Look, uh, I've been hearing rumors for, well, months about automation, écoute, euh, ça fait des mois que j'entends des rumeurs sur l'automatisation mais la direction arrête pas de dire qu'on est, [skeptical], des travailleuses essentielles et euh, que notre expérience peut pas être, [hollow], remplacée par des machines.
552. [gentle] I know it's, um, hard to accept, je sais que c'est euh, difficile à accepter, mais j'ai déjà vu les papiers de licenciement datés pour, [heavy], vendredi prochain, ben, avec ton nom dessus.
Character 1: [stunned] My name specifically on termination papers? Mon nom spécifiquement sur des papiers de licenciement que t'as réussi à, [suspicious], voir même si t'es pas censée être dans cette, [angry], zone restreinte du tout?
553. [improvising] The security guard who let me in has been, [conspiratorial], working with us for weeks, le garde de sécurité qui m'a laissée entrer travaille avec nous depuis des semaines parce que son frère s'est fait remplacer à l'usine de, [passionate], Detroit le mois passé. [pauses]
Character 1: [whispered] Um, well, I can't. Euh, ben, je peux pas.
554. [pressing] You can't what, um, afford to lose this job? Tu peux pas quoi, euh, te permettre de perdre cette job ou genre, tu peux pas te permettre de, [intense], continuer à faire semblant que tout va bien pendant qu'ils sont littéralement en train de démanteler ton gagne-pain? [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [resigned] Twenty-three years I've been standing at, [breaking], this exact machine, 23 ans que je suis plantée devant cette même machine à regarder les mêmes pièces de plastique tomber dans les mêmes bacs pendant que mon, [trembling], dos me lâche tranquillement pis que mes enfants ont grandi sans que je sois jamais allée à leurs, [cracking], pièces de théâtre à l'école. [laughs bitterly]
555. [soft] That's exactly why we need people like you, c'est exactement pour ça qu'on a besoin de personnes comme toi pour, [earnest], nous aider à empêcher que ça arrive à d'autres familles.
Character 1: [wavering] But, um, what are you even suggesting we do? Mais euh, qu'est-ce que tu suggères qu'on fasse au juste, je veux dire, s'enchaîner aux machines ou ben, quelque chose d'aussi inutile?
556. [mysterious] We're not chaining ourselves to anything, on s'enchaîne à rien parce que demain soir on va, [determined], faire en sorte que ces machines produisent quelque chose de complètement différent qui va leur, [mischievous], coûter des millions en rappels de produits.
Character 1: [shocked] You want me to, um, sabotage the molds? Tu veux que je, euh, sabote les moules pis ben, que je risque des accusations fédérales pour, [incredulous], altération de produits juste parce que t'es arrivée ici avec genre, une histoire de paperasse que t'as supposément vue? [nervous laugh]
557. [steady] Not sabotage, just a small adjustment to the temperature settings, pas du sabotage, juste un petit ajustement aux réglages de température qui va, [careful], rendre chaque pièce légèrement hors spécification mais qui va quand même avoir l'air parfait.
Character 1: I've been, um, following every safety protocol and quality standard for two decades, j'ai euh, suivi chaque protocole de sécurité pis chaque norme de qualité pendant 2 décennies pis là tu me demandes de, [conflicted], tout jeter aux poubelles pour ce qui pourrait ben être juste une autre théorie du complot sur les, [tired], robots qui volent nos jobs. [long pause]
558. The robots have, um, already taken your job, les robots ont euh, déjà pris ta job, c'est juste que tu le, [sad], sais pas encore.
Character 1: Maybe they have, but at least I'll walk out of here with my, [proud], dignity intact, peut-être qu'ils l'ont fait, mais au moins je vais sortir d'ici avec ma dignité intacte au lieu d'être une espèce de, [bitter], terroriste industrielle.
559. [fierce] Dignity doesn't, um, pay rent when you're unemployed, la dignité euh, ça paie pas le loyer quand t'es au chômage, je veux dire, demande aux 1000 travailleuses de l'usine de Cleveland qui ont eu, [angry], 2 jours d'avis le mois passé.
Character 1: [defeated] Fine, um, show me what you want me to do, bon, euh, montre-moi ce que tu veux que je fasse, mais ben, si ça tourne mal, j'étais jamais ici pis, [hollow], toi non plus.
560. [triumphant] You were never here anyway, um, just another ghost in the machine, de toute façon t'étais jamais ici, euh, juste un autre fantôme dans la machine qu'elles avaient, [philosophical], toujours prévu d'exorciser, mais ben, au moins maintenant tu vas les hanter en retour avant de, [dark], disparaître complètement dans leurs marges de profit.
Character 1: Euh, ben, salut.
561. [hollow] Alors c'est toi qui, euh, [withering], a gagné le concours à l'époque où j'avais encore, bon, [bitter], quinze millions de personnes qui suivaient chacun de mes mouvements, enfin, avant que tout s'effondre. [laughs weakly]
Character 1: [gentle] Je te suis depuis que, [amazed], j'avais douze ans et tu m'as appris qu'être, [earnest], différente c'était pas quelque chose à cacher mais quelque chose à célébrer.
562. [sardonic] Différente—c'est comme ça qu'ils appelaient ça avant de, [cracking], décider que j'étais problématique et de me cancel du jour au lendemain.
Character 1: [sympathetic] La personne qui m'a inspirée à, [careful], recommencer à peindre après la mort de mes parents est toujours, [emotional], assise juste là peu importe ce que Twitter a décidé.
563. [trembling] Euh, tu comprends pas ce que c'est, bon, [desperate], de se réveiller et voir tout le travail de ta vie juste, [broken], supprimé, effacé comme si t'avais jamais compté, enfin, comme si t'avais jamais existé du tout.
Character 1: [absorbing] Chaque vidéo que t'as faite sur, [tender], trouver la lumière dans l'obscurité a sauvé quelqu'un et ces, [passionate], souvenirs disparaissent pas juste parce que, [firm], l'algorithme a arrêté de te promouvoir.
564. [exhausted] Je, euh, croyais ça aussi avant, tu sais, [vacant], avant les menaces de mort et les sponsors qui se retirent et, bon, [defeated], ma propre famille qui dit que je devrais peut-être, euh, disparaître un moment. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [determined] Ben, enfin, j'ai fait six heures de route pour te rencontrer, [steady], pas à cause de ton nombre d'abonnés.
565. [surprised] Six heures juste pour, euh, [confused], rencontrer quelqu'un qui peut même plus avoir de partenariats pour, bon, [self-deprecating], des bandes blanchissantes, enfin, c'est soit du dévouement soit de la folie.
Character 1: [bright] Euh, ta vidéo sur recommencer après avoir, bon, [sincere], tout perdu m'a donné la permission de continuer à respirer quand je, [quiet], pensais que je pouvais plus.
566. J'ai filmé cette vidéo, euh, [remembering], il y a trois ans quand je croyais encore à mes propres, bon, [nostalgic], conneries motivationnelles, tu vois.
Character 1: [fierce] C'était pas des conneries pour la, [intense], fille de seize ans qui la regardait chaque matin juste pour sortir du lit.
567. [breaking] Euh, je suis désolée.
Character 1: [soft] Tu m'as appris que, euh, [appreciative], l'influence c'est pas une question de chiffres mais de toucher ne serait-ce qu'une seule vie, bon, authentiquement.
568. [crying] J'ai pas eu l'impression de, euh, [raw], compter pour quelqu'un depuis si longtemps que j'ai oublié ce que ça, bon, [vulnerable], fait d'entendre quelqu'un dire que mon travail signifiait, enfin, [choked up], quelque chose de vrai.
Character 1: [tearful] Tu comptes toujours pour, euh, [emphatic], des milliers d'entre nous qui ont grandi en te regardant transformer la douleur en, bon, [loving], art et nous apprendre qu'être brisée veut pas dire, tu sais, [hopeful], être sans valeur.
569. Euh, ben, merci.
Character 1: [whispered] La vraie toi est tellement plus, euh, [awed], belle que la personne parfaite que tu jouais en ligne, enfin.
570. [grateful] Ben, peut-être que, euh, tout perdre valait, tu sais, [contemplative], le coup pour entendre ça. [cries softly]
Character 1: [stunned] Marco Vega, euh, la Marco Vega qui dirigeait, [disbelieving], les boîtes les plus branchées de Miami, ben, j'aurais jamais pensé te trouver à faire des ballons sculptés à un anniversaire d'enfant dans, euh, la banlieue de l'Ohio.
571. Euh, vous faites erreur, enfin, je m'appelle, [forced cheerful], Mme Rigolote et je suis juste là pour faire, [desperate], sourire ces gamins, alors, euh, si vous pouviez me laisser finir mon spectacle, tu vois?
Character 1: Ben, le logiciel de reconnaissance faciale dit le contraire, euh, et ces tatouages sur tes, [pointed], poignets correspondent parfaitement à la description, alors, euh, on sait toutes les deux pourquoi je suis là, enfin, non?
572. [defensive] Écoute, euh, peu importe ce que tu crois savoir sur moi, ben, cette personne est, [bitter], morte, d'accord, alors enfin, laisse-moi tranquille.
Character 1: [firm] Les Moretti m'ont envoyée, euh, et c'est pas le genre à oublier trois cent mille dollars, [harsh], même si t'as échangé ton Versace contre, ben, cette perruque arc-en-ciel que tu portes, enfin, Marco. [sighs]
573. Les enfants nous regardent là et leurs parents, [panicking], ont payé cher pour cette fête, alors on peut au moins aller ailleurs pour parler?
Character 1: [quiet] Euh, cinq minutes.
574. [resigned] Tu sais, euh, j'avais des gens qui suppliaient pour entrer à mes soirées, enfin, des célébrités prenaient l'avion juste pour être, [hollow], vues à mes événements, euh, et regarde-moi maintenant. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [cold] Garde ton histoire larmoyante pour quelqu'un qui, [unmoved], ne t'a pas traquée à travers sept états et quatorze, [tired], alias différents pendant les six derniers mois.
575. [broken] Chaque nuit je rêve de, [trembling], l'ancienne vie, le champagne, la musique si forte qu'on pouvait, [wistful], la sentir dans sa poitrine, et puis je me réveille, [voice cracking], dans mon van derrière un parking Walmart. [long pause]
Character 1: T'avais tout et t'as tout foutu en l'air pour, [disgusted], des paris pourris et de la drogue encore pire, en jouant de l'argent qui n'était même pas à toi.
576. [pleading] J'étais malade, [shaking], d'accord, j'avais un problème et j'ai perdu, [desperate], le contrôle de tout, mais je suis clean maintenant, [voice breaking], huit mois de sobriété et j'essaie de me reconstruire. [sobs]
Character 1: [conflicted] Bon, euh, être clean n'efface pas la dette, et, [regretful], les Moretti ne sont pas connus pour leur, enfin, compassion ou patience avec ceux qui, euh, fuient ce qu'ils doivent. [exhales]
577. [defeated] Alors qu'est-ce qui se passe maintenant, tu vas, [terrified], me ramener à Miami où ils vont, [choking up], probablement faire de moi un exemple, ou tu vas juste, [barely audible], les appeler pour leur dire où je suis? [voice cracks]
Character 1: Euh, je suis censée t'emmener aujourd'hui, mais, ben, je pense sans arrêt à, [struggling], ces gamins là-dedans qui attendent que Mme Rigolote revienne finir le, tu sais, spectacle de magie. [long pause]
578. [desperate] Je peux avoir l'argent, euh, enfin, pas tout d'un coup mais j'ai, [frantic], économisé chaque centime de ces fêtes et, ben, j'ai presque, [hopeful], 5000 déjà, et, euh, je peux en avoir plus si tu me donnes du temps.
Character 1: Tu sais, euh, 5000 ne couvriront même pas les intérêts, enfin, mais il y aurait peut-être, [thoughtful], un autre moyen si tu veux bien, [careful], m'aider avec autre chose dont les Moretti ont, [measured], besoin, ben, quelqu'un avec tes anciens contacts.
579. [cautious] Tout ce qui me garde en vie et, [exhausted], hors d'une fosse peu profonde dans les Everglades.
Character 1: [decided] Euh, finis d'abord la fête parce que ces gamins méritent leur spectacle, puis, ben, on parlera de comment la femme qui connaissait tous les VIP de Miami pourrait, [calculated], être assez utile pour gagner une, [meaningful], deuxième chance, enfin, si t'as de la chance. [sighs heavily]
580. [grateful] Merci, euh, enfin, vraiment, merci—je vais faire les meilleurs, [tearful], putains de ballons sculptés que ces gamins aient jamais vus, tu sais?
581. [gasp softly] Les données... oh mon Dieu, les données montrent vraiment—il faut que je relance ça. Non, attends, je l'ai déjà fait 17 fois. [very excited] C'est ça. C'est vraiment ça ! Les modèles de décalage vers le rouge, ce ne sont pas juste des anomalies, c'est... euh... ils montrent le temps qui s'écoule à l'envers dans ces poches. [pause] De la causalité inversée réelle.

Enfin, on avait théorisé que ça pouvait exister mais [shaky voice] personne ne pensait qu'on trouverait vraiment des preuves. 23 ans que je fixe ces étoiles et maintenant—Putain, ça change tout. [laugh] Les manuels de physique ? Poubelle. Toute notre compréhension de l'entropie ? Fausse. Mais alors fondamentalement fausse.

[very quietly] Et si je m'étais trompée ? Non, non, les calculs sont bons. Hernandez a vérifié indépendamment, elle a obtenu les mêmes résultats depuis l'observatoire chilien. [speeding up] Ça veut dire que le Big Bang n'était pas le début, c'était genre, un point médian ? Un point de bascule où le temps s'est divisé en flux avant et arrière et on n'a vu que la moitié de l'univers tout ce temps—

[long pause]

Mes mains n'arrêtent pas de trembler. [emotionally] Je suis en train de regarder la preuve que quelque part là-bas, les effets arrivent avant les causes. La mort avant la naissance. Les fins avant les commencements. On va devoir le dire à tout le monde demain. [whisper] Tout ce qu'ils savent n'est que la moitié de l'histoire.
582. [shaky voice] Ils arrêtent pas de me dire que je dois faire ça. Que j'ai pas le choix. Euh, genre je suis censée entrer là-dedans demain et dire des mots qui vont—qui vont le détruire. [pause] Mon propre frère. [bitter] La procureure continue de me coacher, tu sais? "Just tell the truth," elle dit. Mais la vérité c'est que Danny a rien fait de ça, and somehow my testimony is supposed to help convict him anyway.

Je continue de penser à quand on était petits et il me, [crying while speaking] il me protégeait toujours de tout. Toujours. [sniffle] Et maintenant ils veulent que je m'assoie dans cette chaise et que je réponde à leurs questions sur le fait d'avoir vu sa voiture ce soir-là, sur le timing, sur—Mon Dieu, je peux pas. [frustrated] But if I don't testify, they'll charge me with contempt.

[whispering] Je leur ai déjà dit ce que j'ai vu. Je veux dire, oui, sa voiture était là, mais ça veut rien dire! [angry] Il y avait des dizaines de voitures là-bas! Honestly, how is this even legal? Forcer quelqu'un à témoigner contre sa famille?

[long pause]

[very sad] Maman peut même plus me regarder. Elle pense que je suis—je sais pas ce qu'elle pense. Que je choisis ça? [exhausted] Demain matin, 9 heures. Je vais m'asseoir dans ce box de témoins et dire la vérité, et d'une manière ou d'une autre, [trailing off] somehow that truth is going to cage an innocent man.
583. [very excited] Elle l'a fait ! Maria s'est vraiment qualifiée ! Je peux pas— je veux dire, quand elle est arrivée dans mon atelier il y a 2 ans, [pause] sa blessure à la colonne était tellement récente, elle pouvait à peine tenir l'arc stable. Et euh, tout le monde disait que l'équipement adaptatif avait des limites, mais je continuais à penser... [passionately] there had to be a way, you know?

La première poignée personnalisée que j'ai faite était un désastre. [laugh] Elle était tellement polie à ce sujet aussi, mais je pouvais voir qu'elle galèrait. Alors on a réessayé. Et encore. J'ai pratiquement redesigné ce mécanisme de déclenchement 17 fois—17 ! [frustrated] Certains soirs j'avais envie d'abandonner, honnêtement. Mais après elle se pointait à l'entraînement, [warm] toujours en avance, never complaining even when the prosthetic attachment was digging into her shoulder.

Ce moment aujourd'hui quand sa dernière flèche a touché en plein centre... [gasp softly] J'arrivais vraiment pas à respirer. Le score qualificatif dont on avait besoin était 630, et elle a tiré 634. [crying while speaking] Pendant 4 ans les gens lui disaient qu'elle ne pourrait plus jamais concourir, et je—on leur a tous prouvé qu'ils avaient tort, non ?

[very quietly] Sa maman m'a serrée dans ses bras après et m'a chuchoté "merci d'avoir cru en elle." Mais genre, [empathetically] comment je pouvais pas y croire ? She never gave up on herself, so neither could I. [long pause] Les Paralympiques, nous voilà.
584. [curious] Okay alors, euh, je vérifie les compteurs dans ce quartier depuis genre 15 ans, et franchement, c'est—c'est vraiment bizarre. [confused] Tout le monde sur Maple Street reçoit ces factures complètement folles, non? Mais voilà le truc, [whispering] their actual usage readings are totally normal. Je veux dire, Mme Henderson m'a montré sa facture—[gasp] 3000 dollars! [frustrated] Et elle vit toute seule, elle utilise à peine la clim.

[excited] Attends attends attends, je viens de réaliser quelque chose. Alors hier, euh, j'étais en train de vérifier la boîte de jonction, et il y a ce—[pause] okay ça va paraître dingue mais [speeding up] il y a une ligne supplémentaire qui part du principal qui ne devrait même pas exister. [stern] Someone literally tapped into the neighborhood grid, et tu sais, ils ont carrément recâblé pour que leur consommation soit, euh, redistribuée sur les compteurs de tous les autres.

[angry] Je n'arrive pas à croire—en fait non, [laugh] je peux totalement le croire. [confidently] C'est cette nouvelle mansion au bout de la rue, non? Celle avec, euh, la piscine énorme et ces fontaines ridicules? [sarcastic] Oh bien sûr, ils "économisent l'énergie." [triumphant] I've got readings that prove everything. [relieved] Enfin, on va pouvoir régler ce bordel et corriger les factures de tout le monde.
585. [surprised] Oh mon Dieu, Jake ? Salut ! Je—wouah, ça fait quoi, genre trois semaines depuis qu'on s'est parlé ? [warm] Non, non, bien sûr que j'ai le temps, qu'est-ce qui—[pause] attends, tu as l'air différent. Mieux, en fait. [curious] Vraiment ? Les papiers sont passés ? Oh mec, c'est, enfin, c'était temps, non ? [relieved] Je sais à quel point tout ça a été horrible pour toi, donc c'est—[short pause]

Attends, quoi ? [confused] Mon soutien ? Jake, franchement, j'ai rien fait de spécial, j'ai juste, tu sais, écouté quand t'avais besoin de vider ton sac sur, euh, tous les trucs avec l'avocat et—[emotional] oh. [sniffle] Non, tu vas me faire—[shaky voice] Je suis vraiment contente d'avoir pu aider, je t'assure. [clearing throat] Écoute, on n'est peut-être pas du même sang, mais t'es mon frère, d'accord ? Et quand Papa a épousé ta mère, j'ai gagné, genre, le meilleur beau-frère que j'aurais pu espérer. [smiling speaking] Tu te souviens quand on était ados et qu'on s'est, euh, carrément détestés pendant genre six mois ? [chuckle] Et maintenant on est là, 20 ans plus tard et c'est moi que t'appelles en premier avec ta nouvelle.

[very sincerely] Je suis juste—je suis vraiment fière de toi d'avoir traversé tout ça. Sérieusement. [warm] Tu vas t'en sortir, Jake. En fait, tu vas faire mieux que t'en sortir.
586. [shaky voice] Trois pièces. Trois putains de pièces disparues pendant que je mangeais un sandwich de merde. Le Morimoto, le Castellani de la première période, et—mon Dieu—le Rothwell que je viens, [pause], que je viens littéralement d'acquérir la semaine dernière. 45 minutes, c'est tout le temps que j'étais partie.

[angry] Et maintenant la compagnie d'assurance me dit qu'ils ne couvriront que 60 pourcent à cause d'une clause de merde sur, euh, "les locaux non surveillés pendant les heures d'ouverture." Vous vous foutez de moi? Je veux dire, j'ai des caméras, j'ai un système d'alarme, j'ai—[frustrated] rien n'a servi parce que celui qui a fait ça savait exactement ce qu'il cherchait. They walked past everything else and went straight for those three.

[bitter] 20 ans que je construis la réputation de cette galerie. 20 ans de relations avec des collectionneurs qui me faisaient confiance pour, genre, protéger leurs investissements. [quietly] Et maintenant je dois appeler la succession Rothwell et expliquer que le tableau de leur grand-mère est juste... parti.

Le coup financier à lui seul pourrait—[trailing off] je ne veux même pas calculer. On parle de quoi, 800 000 de perte après l'assurance? [sigh] Maybe more.

[exhausted] Je n'arrête pas de repasser le film, tu sais? Si j'avais commandé à emporter, si j'avais envoyé mon assistante à ma place, si j'avais—mais c'est inutile. [pause] They're gone. Et je dois trouver comment survivre à ça, putain.
587. [warm] So when you said you've been skipping meals to make sure your daughter eats, I just— [pause] Let me pull up your information again. [focused] Because based on what you're telling me, um, you definitely qualify for way more than you think. [excited] Oh my God, wait, you've never applied for WIC? [speeding up] And the childcare assistance program—you could get up to eighty percent covered! That's like, what, six hundred dollars back in your pocket every month?

[empathetically] I see this look on your face, and I get it. [gently] Nobody ever explained this stuff to you, right? [passionate] But listen, these aren't handouts—you've been paying into these systems. [determined] Your daughter qualifies for the free breakfast and lunch program, plus there's actually this emergency fund for, uh, medical expenses that nobody knows about. [very sincerely] When you said you haven't been to the dentist in three years because— [voice breaking] sorry, it just gets me sometimes.

[clearing throat] Look, I'm going to stay late tonight, [confidently] and we're going to fill out every single application together. [hopeful] By next month, you're going to have health coverage, food assistance, childcare help— [emotional] you're going to be able to breathe again. [smiling speaking] Your whole life is about to change, I promise you that.
588. [relieved] God, I can't believe they actually—like, Mark literally came up to me today and said, "You were right." [laugh] Those exact words! After, what, two years of them basically treating me like I was, um, delusional? [bitter] "Too ambitious," they said. "Not realistic." [pause] And now suddenly, [speeding up] now that the numbers are in and the board's actually impressed, everyone's all, you know, "We always knew you had it in you." [sarcastic] Right. Sure you did. [short pause] The thing is, I mean, I'm not even angry anymore. [slowly] Okay, maybe a little angry. But mostly it's just... [sigh] I don't know, kind of surreal? Like, Sarah—Sarah who literally laughed when I presented my initial proposal—[mocking] she asked me to mentor her today. [gasp softly] Can you believe that? Honestly, part of me wanted to say something petty, but [warm] I didn't. Because here's the thing, proving them wrong wasn't even—it wasn't the point anymore. [confidently] I just kept doing the work, you know? Head down, focused, and now... [smiling speaking] now they see what I've always seen. [cheerful] And that feels pretty damn good, actually.
589. Deux cents personnes. C'est, euh, c'est ça qui me revient sans arrêt. [very slowly] Pas les chiffres sur les tableaux, pas les—les marges bénéficiaires ou quoi. [pause] C'est les visages, tu vois ? [warm] Genre quand j'ai traversé l'atelier la semaine dernière et que j'ai vu Maria, elle est là depuis, quoi, trente-deux ans ? [emotional] Et elle m'a juste pris les mains et—[voice breaking] désolée, je deviens toute—[clearing throat] bref, ses enfants sont à l'université, hein ? Première génération. [passionately] Tout ça aurait disparu ! Tout !

[anxious] Mon Dieu, enfin, quand j'ai regardé leurs comptes pour la première fois, c'était genre—franchement, c'était une catastrophe. [frustrated] Trois générations à, en quelque sorte, faire les choses de la même façon pendant que tout autour d'eux... [trailing off] Mais le truc c'est que, [animated] ils avaient tous ces actifs dont ils se rendaient même pas compte ! Les brevets à eux seuls étaient—[excited] j'ai carrément crié quand je les ai trouvés ! [laugh]

[very sincerely] Mais tu sais quoi ? Le vieux monsieur, M. Chen, il m'a, euh, il m'a remerciée hier. [slowly] Mais je n'arrête pas de penser... [long pause] ces familles ont pas perdu leurs maisons parce que j'ai vu quelque chose que tout le monde avait raté. [relieved] C'est pas de la stratégie, c'est—je sais pas, c'est juste... [happy] c'est tout, en fait, non ?
590. [shaky voice] Mon Dieu, je n'arrive pas à m'arrêter—mes mains tremblent encore. Cette petite fille, elle était, euh, coincée sous cette voiture et j'ai juste... [gasp] J'ai même pas réfléchi, tu sais? Le changement s'est fait tout seul. [relieved] Et pour une fois, pour UNE FOIS ça a vraiment servi à quelque chose.

[bitter] 6 mois que personne ne veut même me regarder. 6 mois depuis, euh, cette soirée où j'ai—où tout le monde a vu ce que je suis vraiment. [sniffle] J'ai perdu mon travail, perdu Sarah, basically lost everything because of this... cette chose en moi.

Mais aujourd'hui, [animated] quand je l'ai entendue crier, c'était comme—je veux dire, personne d'autre ne pouvait soulever cette voiture, non? [passionate] La bête a pris le dessus et soudain je lance une voiture de 2 tonnes comme si c'était rien! [laugh] Les mêmes griffes qui ont fait fuir tout le monde, elles ont, euh, they cut through her seatbelt like it was nothing.

[very slowly] Sa mère m'a regardée—la vraie moi, toute transformée—et elle n'a pas crié. Elle a juste... [crying while speaking] elle a dit merci. Encore et encore. Merci, merci, merci.

[whispering] Peut-être que je ne suis pas un monstre. [pause] Je veux dire, monsters don't save people, do they? [hopeful] Peut-être que cette malédiction est en fait—je sais pas, maybe it's meant to be here. Pour des moments comme ça. [very sincerely] Pour elle.
591. [relieved] Oh mon Dieu, je viens de recevoir le mail—sa demande a été acceptée ! [pause] Tout, absolument tout ce qu'on a, euh, documenté. [extremely happy] Marcus va enfin toucher ses indemnités ! Je veux dire, franchement, après tout ce qu'il a traversé, c'est comme—[emotional] désolée, je suis un peu... [sniffle] Le truc, c'est que, tu sais, quand je l'ai rencontré pour la première fois, il pouvait à peine, euh, parler de l'Afghanistan. [empathetically] Trois missions, et puis il rentre au pays pour mener un autre genre de bataille, tu vois ? Avec l'administration des anciens combattants. [frustrated] C'est juste—ça ne devrait pas être aussi dur pour eux, tu sais ? [pause] Mais bref, on a réussi. [warm] Tous ces dossiers médicaux qu'on a retrouvés, les, euh, témoignages de ses camarades d'unité, ce rapport du neurologue sur son traumatisme crânien—[cheerful] tout a compté ! [laugh] Mon Dieu, j'ai littéralement commencé à pleurer en lisant la lettre d'acceptation. Genre, assise à mon bureau, juste... [trailing off] Je veux dire, c'est pour ça que je fais ce boulot, franchement. [passionately] Ces vétérans, ils ont tellement donné, et quand le système fonctionne enfin, quand on peut vraiment, euh, les aider à obtenir ce qu'ils méritent—[very sincerely] il n'y a rien de mieux. Rien. [happy] J'ai hâte de l'appeler.
592. [gasp] Oh mon Dieu, je—attendez, qu'est-ce que vous faites tous—[shocked voice] c'est un gâteau? [pause] Les amis, je peux pas—[crying while speaking] oh non, je vais pleurer, I'm actually gonna cry at work right now. [sniffle] C'est, euh, c'est littéralement la chose la plus douce que quelqu'un ait jamais— [voice breaking] Madame Henderson, c'est vous qui avez organisé ça? Et Monsieur Tony avec votre, euh, votre hanche qui fait mal, vous êtes venu le jour de votre congé? [laugh] Je suis complètement défaite là, regardez-moi!

[warm] Vous savez, j'allais juste, genre, faire mon shift et peut-être prendre quelque chose à emporter plus tard, rien de spécial. [pause] Mais ça—[very sincerely] you have no idea what this means to me. Déménager ici, recommencer à zéro, le truc c'est que je ne connaissais vraiment personne et— [cheerful] oh mon Dieu, écoutez-moi devenir toute sentimentale! [laugh loudly]

Jake, tu es vraiment en train de filmer ça? [embarrassed] J'ai l'air terrible! Mon mascara est probablement, tu sais, complètement foutu. [happy] Mais honnêtement? C'est—this might be my best birthday ever. [getting emotional] Vous n'êtes pas juste des clients, vous êtes comme—[pause] vous êtes mes gens. My morning people. [delighted] Venez ici, tous, câlin de groupe derrière le comptoir! I don't even care if corporate sees this!
593. [hesitantly] J'ai eu la promotion aujourd'hui. Comptable senior. Le poste exact que Sandra avait depuis, euh, douze ans. [pause] Ils m'ont convoquée dans la salle de conférence ce matin et j'ai cru—franchement j'ai cru qu'ils allaient me virer aussi. Mais à la place, ils me donnent son bureau. [regretful] Sa tasse est encore sur le bureau, tu sais ? Celle avec le mème débile du chat qui dit "J'ai survécu à une autre réunion qui aurait pu être un email."

[sigh] Elle m'a tout appris. Genre, littéralement tout sur l'audit judiciaire, sur comment lire entre les lignes des états financiers. [sad] Et maintenant je suis assise dans son fauteuil à gagner 20 000 de plus qu'elle n'a jamais gagné parce qu'ils ont "restructuré le package salarial." [bitter] C'est exactement ce qu'ils ont dit. Restructuré.

Je veux dire, j'ai travaillé dur pour ça, [quietly] je sais que je le mérite. Mais c'est tellement... [trailing off] Elle m'a envoyé un texto de félicitations ce matin. Tu te rends compte ? [shaky voice] Ça fait trois semaines qu'elle est au chômage et elle me félicite. Elle a dit qu'elle était fière, que j'allais faire des choses extraordinaires. [pause]

[anxious] Tout le monde me regarde comme si j'étais une sorte de traître. Mais qu'est-ce que j'étais censée faire, hein ? Refuser ? [frustrated] Le crédit immobilier ne va pas se payer tout seul. [very quietly] J'aurais juste aimé que ça ne se passe pas comme ça.
594. [bitter] Trente-deux ans. Trente-deux ans que je perce des boules de bowling dans cette boutique, et maintenant ils vont juste—[pause] Enfin, regarde-moi cette horreur en face. [sarcastic] "Bowl-Mart : Votre Supermarché du Bowling." Ouais, super original.

[frustrated] Tu sais combien ils prennent pour un perçage ? 29,99 €. Vingt-neuf ! Je peux même pas acheter les forets à ce prix-là. [laugh] Et les gens y vont vraiment, genre, [mocking] "Oh wow, quelle affaire !" 

[sad] Mme Henderson est passée hier—elle est ma cliente depuis 97—et elle pouvait même pas me regarder dans les yeux quand elle m'a dit qu'elle avait acheté sa nouvelle boule là-bas. [sigh] Elle a dit qu'ils offraient le perçage gratuit avec l'achat. Gratuit. Comment je suis censée rivaliser avec du gratuit ?

[quietly] Mon père a lancé ce commerce. Il m'a tout appris sur la lecture de la main d'un joueur, euh, trouver le pitch et l'écartement parfaits. [warm] Chaque boule était comme une petite œuvre d'art, tu vois ? Sur mesure, parfaitement équilibrée. [bitter] Mais apparemment plus personne s'en fout du savoir-faire quand tu peux le faire faire par un ado avec une—[trailing off]

[exhausted] J'sais pas, peut-être qu'il est temps de juste... [long pause] Le bail se termine dans trois mois de toute façon. [resigned] Trente-deux ans, et tout ça se termine à cause d'une putain de chaîne de magasins.
595. I can't—I literally can't process this right now. They said yes. They actually, um, they said yes to the film. [gasp softly] Not just yes, but like, they want to premiere it at the festival. The main stage. I mean, honestly, six months ago I had this thing sitting on my hard drive just... collecting dust, you know? [very melancholic] I was so close to deleting the whole project. Like, my finger was literally on the delete button because I thought it was garbage, absolute garbage. And now—[laugh] God, I'm such an idiot—now they're calling it "visionary" and, uh, what was the word... "transcendent." [excited] Me! My weird little experimental thing that everyone said was too strange, too niche, too whatever. Actually, wait, I need to call my mom. [stuttering] She-she never stopped believing in this even when I did. Even when I was like, sobbing at three AM saying I wasted two years of my life. [clearing throat] The thing is, er, I almost didn't even submit it. Like, the deadline was in twenty minutes and I was just sitting there thinking, why bother, right? [extremely happy] But something made me hit send. And here we are. They're flying me out. Business class. They're putting me up in a hotel. [whispering] This is insane. This is completely, utterly insane.
596. [confused] Fifteen years. Fifteen YEARS I've been with this company, and they're sitting me down telling me I—what? Embezzled? [laugh] This has to be some kind of mistake, right? Like, there's no way anyone actually believes... [pause] Oh my God, you're serious. You're actually serious.

[angry] I've never taken a single penny that wasn't mine! Not even—I mean, I don't even expense my coffee runs half the time! And now suddenly there's, what, [sarcastic] mysteriously missing funds that somehow trace back to me? This is insane. [frustrated] Do you know how many weekends I've given up for this place? How many times I've stayed late to fix other people's mistakes?

[shaky voice] My kids know the security guard's name because I've brought them here so many times when I had to work late. [cry] I decorated my office with their drawings, for God's sake. [long pause] 

[bitter] Someone's setting me up. That's the only explanation, because the numbers—they don't lie, right? But neither do I. [very quietly] I thought you all knew me better than this. Fifteen years, and it means nothing? [sigh] I need to call my lawyer. [furious] And when I prove this is wrong, we're going to have a very different conversation.
597. [exhausted] Okay so, um, we've got seventeen hours—no wait, [quickly] sixteen hours now—before the hospital runs out of ventilator filters. I mean, honestly, I haven't slept in... [trailing off] God, when did I last sleep? [short pause] The shipment's stuck in customs and they're telling me, like, standard processing takes forty-eight hours. [frustrated] Forty-eight! We don't have forty-eight hours, we have—[shouting] we have dying patients!

[deep breath] Right, okay, so here's the thing—I found a loophole. [animated] Emergency medical provisions, article seven point three. Basically, if I can get the health minister's signature, we bypass the whole—[relieved] oh thank God, the email just came through. [very quickly] They signed it, they actually signed it!

[anxious] But now, uh, the truck drivers are saying the route's flooded. Of course it is. [bitter] Of course the main highway is underwater during a medical crisis. Wait wait wait, [excited] what about the military base? They have helicopters, right? And technically, this qualifies as, you know, humanitarian aid.

[passionately] Look, I don't care if I have to, er, personally drive these supplies myself. [shaky voice] These are kids in that ICU. Little kids who need—[pause] who need us to figure this out. [confidently] And we will. We always do.
598. [bitter] Regarde-moi ça. Appart' penthouse, vue sur toute cette putain de ville. 20 millions planqués sur des comptes offshore et, euh, personne avec qui partager tout ça. [laugh] Maman répond même plus à mes appels. Papa a changé de numéro—j'peux pas lui en vouloir.

[sarcastic] « On t'a élevée mieux que ça », c'est ce qu'elle m'a dit la dernière fois, maman. Ouais ben, [loudly] votre belle éducation, elle m'a fait cumuler trois boulots juste pour payer le loyer ! [pause] J'ai fait ce que j'avais à faire. J'ai bâti un empire à partir de rien, même si ça voulait dire... [trailing off]

[regretful] Sarah veut plus que je voie les enfants. Mes propres nièces savent même pas que j'existe. Elle leur a dit que j'étais morte—[gasp softly]—tu te rends compte ? Elle a vraiment dit à ses gamines que leur tante était morte plutôt que d'expliquer ce que je fais.

[angry] Ils voulaient que je sois respectable ! Ils voulaient que je joue selon des règles qui étaient truquées contre nous depuis le début ! [long pause]

[sad] J'ai tout maintenant, tu vois ? Des voitures, des maisons, en gros tout ce que l'argent peut acheter. [crying while speaking] Mais j'échangerais tout ça pour un seul dimanche en famille avec eux. Juste une dernière fois entendre les blagues pourries de papa, [sniffle] aider maman dans la cuisine...

[resigned] Mais c'est ça le prix. C'est ce que ça m'a coûté. [quietly] Et j'imagine que je le savais depuis le début.
599. [bitter] Alors ils ont enfin remarqué, hein ? Vingt-trois ans à, euh, me crever à la tâche dans cet entrepôt et MAINTENANT ils me donnent employée du mois. [laugh] Je veux dire, le timing est juste—c'est franchement hilarant quand on y pense. [pause] Mon superviseur débarque tout, genre, félicitations pour vos indicateurs de performance, [mocking] "la meilleure emballeuse qu'on ait jamais eue," et là, littéralement dans la même phrase, il mentionne la, euh, la réunion sur l'automatisation la semaine prochaine. [frustrated] Tu te fous de moi ? J'atteins ces chiffres depuis, j'sais pas, une éternité en gros, et ils choisissent MAINTENANT pour— [trailing off]

[sigh] Le truc c'est que j'étais vraiment fière pendant, enfin, trente secondes ? [sad] Avant de réaliser ce que ça veut vraiment dire. Ils documentent ma vitesse de travail pour pouvoir, tu sais, programmer les robots pour faire pareil. [angry] Je suis littéralement en train de former mon propre remplaçant ! [shaky voice] Et tout le monde fait comme si on voyait pas tous ce qui arrive. Mes collègues sont tous, euh, ils font comme si de rien n'était mais on sait— [very quietly] on sait tous ce qui se passe après qu'ils "étudient nos techniques."

[exhausted] J'imagine que je devrais, euh, commencer à chercher autre chose, non ? [hesitantly] Mais qu'est-ce que je suis censée faire d'autre ? C'est tout ce que j'ai— [long pause]

[whispering] Vingt-trois ans.
600. [gasp loudly] Ils ne sont plus sur la liste. Les—les lamantins sont officiellement retirés de la liste des espèces menacées. [pause] J'ai juste, euh, j'ai reçu le mail il y a 20 minutes et je l'ai relu genre, [shaky voice] je l'ai relu 15 fois déjà. 32 ans. Ça fait 32 ans que je—Mon Dieu, [laugh] quand j'ai commencé, il en restait à peine 500 dans ces eaux.

[crying while speaking] Je me souviens de ce premier recensement, tu vois, les compter un par un, en pensant qu'on arrivait trop tard. Genre, franchement, je pensais qu'on documentait leur extinction. [sniffle] Mais après les zones protégées ont vraiment marché, et les collisions avec les bateaux ont chuté de, quoi, 70 pour cent ? Et les herbiers marins—[excited] oh mon Dieu, les herbiers marins sont revenus !

[slowly] Toutes ces nuits à dormir sur le bateau de recherche, euh, à rater des anniversaires, à rater—[trailing off] ben, à rater beaucoup de choses. [laugh loudly] Mon ex disait toujours que j'aimais ces « vaches de mer » plus que tout le reste. [pause] Elle avait peut-être raison, enfin—[warm] mais regarde-les maintenant. 2000 individus. Des petits en bonne santé chaque saison.

[very sincerely] Ils vont s'en sortir. Après tout ça, ils vont vraiment s'en sortir. [relieved] Je crois que j'ai besoin de, euh, m'asseoir une minute. Ou peut-être [chuckle] aller les voir. Ouais. Il faut que j'aille voir mes lamantins.
Character 1: [shocked] Um, uh, what—err, who?
601. [defensive] Before you scream or call anyone, [quietly], let me explain why I'm here because this isn't, [hesitantly], what it looks like at all.
Character 1: [confused] Well, um, you're clearly breaking in here with, [shaky voice], what looks like professional tools, so, uh, I mean how is this not exactly what it looks like? [nervous laugh]
602. Look, um, I know this seems bad but, [frustrated], I was actually just trying to, well, get to those rare manuscripts in the back vault, you know?
Character 1: [stern] You can't just break into a library, [angry], even if you're desperate for money because those manuscripts, [trembling], are priceless historical artifacts that belong to, [passionately], this entire community.
603. [apologetic] Wait, you're living here aren't you—I can see, [surprised], the makeshift bed behind that desk and the, [whispering], hot plate tucked behind those encyclopedias. [pause]
Character 1: [embarrassed] That's, um, completely different because I work here and, [very quietly], sometimes I just, well, stay late to catch up on cataloging, you know?
604. [empathetically] No one stays this late with a sleeping bag and, [warm], three weeks of canned goods unless they've lost their place, [softly], just like I lost mine six months ago before turning to this. [sigh]
Character 1: [bitter] So, um, what, we're supposed to bond over being, [sad], homeless now, I mean, while you're literally trying to steal from the only place I have left? [groan]
605. [regretful] The fence promised me enough for those manuscripts to, [desperately], get a fresh start somewhere new.
Character 1: [curious] You realize those particular manuscripts are, [thoughtful], actually brilliant forgeries I created to protect the real ones, which are, [proudly], safely hidden in a climate-controlled vault that even I don't have the key to.
606. [shocked] You forged historical documents and, [incredulous], displayed them publicly while the real ones are, [anxiously], locked away somewhere else entirely?
Character 1: [mocking] Brilliant thief.
607. [defeated] This whole night has been one, [exhausted], massive mistake and now you're probably going to, [worried], call the police on me anyway.
Character 1: The security cameras have been broken for, [whispering loudly], three months which is how you got in so easily, [relieved], but also means there's no evidence you were ever here.
608. [suspicious] Why would you let me walk away when I just, [nervously], tried to rob the place you're secretly living in? [long pause]
Character 1: [sincerely] Because, um, I know what desperation feels like and, [gently], maybe we can figure out something better than, er, you know, stealing fake manuscripts that wouldn't have helped you anyway.
609. You're suggesting what exactly—that I should, [skeptical], trust a librarian who forges documents and, [cautiously], lives illegally in a public building?
Character 1: [determined] Well, um, I'm suggesting that maybe two people who've, [hopeful], hit rock bottom might be able to, er, help each other climb back up, you know? [clearing throat]
610. [contemplative] The night janitor position just opened up here and, [slowly], they don't do background checks for custodial staff, [meaningfully], plus it comes with a legitimate key to the building.
Character 1: [shocked] Stop right there, you're releasing, [angry], our entire breeding stock of endangered sturgeon that took, [shaky voice], five years to cultivate and you have no idea what you're doing! [gasp]
611. [defiant] Well, um, these creatures deserve freedom, not, [passionately], living their entire lives in concrete tanks while you, er, [frustrated], play god with their genetics, you know?
Character 1: [exhausted] Those concrete tanks are the only reason, [bitter], this species still exists after the dam construction wiped out, [trembling], ninety percent of their natural spawning grounds twenty years ago.
612. [hesitantly] I mean, uh, keeping them captive can't be the answer when, [confused], nature has its own ways of healing and, like, [quietly], maybe we should trust that process, you know?
Character 1: [empathetically] Nature doesn't heal when we've destroyed the entire river system with, [pause], industrial runoff and hydroelectric projects. [sigh]
613. [whispering] Um, I didn't, er, know that.
Character 1: [warm] Please, just listen.
614. Well, um, every animal I've rescued wanted freedom more than, [sad], safety, and I thought these fish would, uh, [regretful], feel the same way, but maybe I was, like, [trailing off], projecting my own beliefs onto them.
Character 1: [relieved] Look, I mean, I understand your heart is, [gently], in the right place because, um, [sincere], anyone who cares this much about animals can't be all wrong. [chuckle]
615. [apologetic] Well, um, I just, er, couldn't stand it.
Character 1: [curious] Um, couldn't stand, well, what exactly?
616. [anxious] The way they circle endlessly in those tanks like, [very quietly], prisoners counting days they'll never get back, and seeing their eyes, [crying while speaking], always searching for something that isn't there anymore. [sniffle]
Character 1: [kindly] Every single fish you're seeing was born here, [long pause], never knew the wild you're imagining for them.
617. But surely, I mean, their instincts must tell them, [hopeful], there's something more beyond these walls, er, [speeding up], some genetic memory of rivers and currents, you know? [gasp softly]
Character 1: [thoughtful] Actually, um, you're not entirely wrong about that because, well, [animated], we've documented fascinating migration behaviors even in tenth-generation captive-bred specimens. [laugh]
618. [excited] Then you understand why keeping them here feels, [melancholic], fundamentally wrong to someone like me.
Character 1: [passionate] What feels wrong is watching a species disappear forever while, [stern], people argue about philosophy instead of taking, [quickly], practical action to save them.
619. [softly] Well, um, maybe we could work together somehow, like, [hopefully], combining your scientific knowledge with, uh, [friendly], my field experience to create something better than either of us imagined, you know?
Character 1: You just tried to sabotage five years of conservation work, but, [considering], there's something about your passion that reminds me why, [nostalgic], I started this work in the first place. [deep sigh]
620. [determined] Then let me help you do it right by, [earnest], teaching me what these fish really need instead of, [pleading], what I assume they want based on my rescue work. [soft laugh]
Character 1: Um, well, she's upstairs. [pause]
621. [confused] I thought you said she wasn't playing anymore when you called, [hesitantly], but I can hear Rachmaninoff coming through the ceiling right now, [quietly], beautifully actually. [long pause]
Character 1: [warm] She came back from New York three days ago after another, [bitter], setback with her management dropping her because of, [shaky voice], what they called reliability issues.
622. [empathetically] That's the fourth time in two years she's returned home, [frustrated], each time with the piano more damaged than before from her, [anxious], explosive practice sessions when things don't go, [slowly], perfectly.
Character 1: [accepting] It's just her process. [sigh]
623. [stern] Um, actually, I mean—[trailing off]
Character 1: [offering] Look, um, I know what you're thinking but, well, she needs this piano to be perfect right now, [passionately], it's the only thing keeping her grounded while she figures out her next move, you know?
624. [very sincerely] Mrs. Chen, I've been tuning this Steinway for fifteen years and watching it, [upset], absorb her rage every time she fails has been, [very quietly], heartbreaking for both the instrument and, [whispering], probably for her too.
Character 1: [defensive] She's not failing, she's just experiencing temporary setbacks that any artist, [quickly], faces when they're pursuing something extraordinary and I'm helping her, [excited], stay focused on the bigger picture here. [gasp softly]
625. [monotone] Well, um, the hammers are completely worn down from her, I mean, aggressive playing, [apologetic], the soundboard has a new crack from last month's incident, and, like, [exhausted], I can't keep pretending these repairs are normal maintenance anymore.
Character 1: Maybe if you understood what she's been through with those, [angry], vultures in the industry who promised her everything then—
626. [firmly] I've watched dozens of young pianists burn out because nobody told them, [regretful], the difference between passion and self-destruction, and your daughter is, [trembling], racing toward a cliff you keep pretending isn't there.
Character 1: [overly polite] Well, um, I appreciate your concern but, like, she's my daughter and I know what she needs. [nervous laugh]
627. She needs honesty. [cough]
Character 1: [pleading] Can you please just tune the piano so she can prepare for her next audition, [hopefully], the one in Chicago that could change everything if she just gets another chance? [sniffle]
628. [resigned] I'll tune it. [deep sigh]
Character 1: The piano has survived everything she's thrown at it because, [proudly], just like her mother, it knows how to endure and, [cheerful], support her through the storms.
629. [sad] Um, pianos don't endure, Mrs. Chen, they, well, break. [groan]
Character 1: [whispering loudly] Er, um, maybe they do.
630. [very melancholic] One day you'll sit in this room listening to silence where music, [crying while speaking], used to live and wonder if enabling her pain was really, [bitterly], love after all, [very slowly], but it will be too late.
Character 1: Where's, [crying while speaking], my mommy?
631. [warm] Hey there sweetheart, it's okay, I can see you're, [empathetically], scared but we're going to find your mommy together right now.
Character 1: She was here and then, um, [shaky voice], she wasn't here and I looked everywhere and, well, [sniffling], the big room has too many people and, you know, [very quietly], I can't see her anywhere.
632. [gently] I understand completely, and, um, you know what, [playful], I'm really good at finding people because, well, [confidently], that's actually part of my job, like finding lost things and helping people. [chuckle]
Character 1: [hesitantly] You help find mommies who get, [confused], lost in the big building with all the, [anxious], scary doors that make loud sounds? [gasp]
633. [cheerful] Exactly right!
Character 1: [child-like] But, um, what if she, like, [worried], went home without me or, you know, [trembling], forgot I was here because, well, sometimes grownups forget important things.
634. Mommies never forget their babies, especially, [passionately], wonderful brave ones like you who are being so, [very sincerely], strong right now even though this is scary.
Character 1: [curious] Are you, um, like a police person but, well, [excited], without the shiny badge and, you know, [speeding up], the hat that my friend Tommy's dad wears?
635. [animated] Even better!
Character 1: [relieved] My mommy says there are good people who, [friendly], help kids when they need it and you have, [happy], nice eyes like the lady at my school.
636. [delighted] That's, um, such a sweet thing to say, and, well, I bet your mommy taught you, [proudly], lots of smart things about staying safe.
Character 1: [slowly] She told me if I get lost to find someone who, [carefully], looks like they work here and tell them, [loudly], my whole name which is Emma Rose Martinez. [pause]
637. Emma Rose Martinez is such a, [enthusiastically], beautiful name and you did exactly the right thing talking to me.
Character 1: [shy] Will you hold my hand while we, [nervously], look for her because my legs feel wobbly? [sniffle]
638. [softly] Of course sweetie.
Character 1: [hopefully] Maybe she's by the water fountain because she, [giggling], always gets thirsty after we go places and she, [very excited], lets me push the button to make the water come out. [laugh]
639. That sounds like the perfect place to, [encouragingly], start our search and we'll check every water fountain in this building.
Character 1: [trusting] You promise you won't leave me alone until we, [quietly], find her?
640. [very sincerely] I promise, and, you know, um, I actually just spent all morning, [determined], fighting for kids just like you, so, well, [emotionally], there's nowhere else I'd rather be than helping you find your mommy.
Character 1: Well, I mean, the protests outside are, [defiant], getting louder by the hour but I stand by every, [firm], word I said about reforming this archaic system, you know.
641. [frustrated] Your Majesty, that speech wasn't just controversial, it was, [exasperated], political suicide wrapped in royal purple.
Character 1: [resolute] Um, maybe it's time someone in this palace stopped, well, pretending everything is fine while our people suffer.
642. The nobility is already, [urgent], drafting letters calling for your abdication, and I mean, the military commanders are, [worried], conspicuously silent which is never, [grave], a good sign, you know.
Character 1: [steady] So, um, what would you have me do—take it all back and, well, bow to their threats like every weak monarch before me?
643. [pleading] I'd have you survive long enough to, [careful], actually implement these reforms instead of becoming a, [bitter], martyr that changes nothing except who sits on, well, your throne tomorrow, I mean.
Character 1: My grandmother ruled for sixty years by, [contemptuous], never challenging anyone, never changing anything, and look where that, [angry], spineless approach left us—a kingdom rotting from, [disgusted], the inside out.
644. [sharp] Well, she also died peacefully in her bed instead of, um, facing a coup d'état at twenty-eight.
Character 1: [fierce] I'd rather rule for one year with, [passionate], integrity than spend decades as a puppet dancing while, um, the same corrupt ministers pull my, [bitter], strings, you know.
645. Integrity doesn't stop bullets, [cold], Your Majesty, and right now there are three generals who've, [tense], canceled their meetings with you this week which means they're, [ominous], meeting with each other instead, I mean.
Character 1: [determined] Then let them come—I have the people's support and, well, that's worth more than a dozen generals who've grown, [scornful], fat on bribes and stolen taxes, um, don't you think?
646. [weary] The people's support won't mean much when tanks roll through the palace gates.
Character 1: [quiet] You sound like you've already chosen a side.
647. [offended] I'm trying to save your life because despite your recklessness you're the first monarch in a century who actually gives a damn.
Character 1: If they remove me, [resigned], who takes the throne—my cousin Marcus who's basically a puppet already, you know?
648. [grim] Exactly.
Character 1: [resolved] Then we fight.
649. [reluctant] Well, if we're doing this, um, we need to move fast—secure the treasury, [urgent], get the city guard on our side before the generals make their move.
Character 1: You just said this was, [suspicious], political suicide but now you're planning our defense strategy?
650. [resigned] I've served three monarchs and watched two of them fall because they, [sad], lacked the courage to change anything that mattered, so maybe, [hopeful], it's time I backed someone foolish enough to, um, actually try, you know.
Character 1: [exhausted] Um, I didn't expect this place to look, [quietly], exactly the same after ten years, like, you know, even the smell of fresh bread is, [nostalgic], bringing back memories I thought I'd buried.
651. [warm] Well, um, some of us never left, I mean, we just kept, [slowly], kneading the same dough and watching the sunrise through these windows while you were, [bitter], conquering Silicon Valley, you know.
Character 1: [apologetic] I know how it must look from your perspective, me showing up here after the acquisition made headlines, [regretful], wanting to reconnect like nothing happened.
652. Um, yeah, well, it's... [pause]
Character 1: Please, just listen.
653. The irony is that this bakery we were going to, [frustrated], expand together is now worth more to me than any of your, [sarcastic], stock options ever could be. [sigh]
Character 1: [hesitantly] You know, um, every board meeting, every quarterly report, er, I'd think about, [very sad], how we used to plan our empire of artisan bakeries across the state, I mean.
654. [caring] Well, um, I won't lie and say I didn't feel, [angry], abandoned when you took that job offer instead, you know.
Character 1: [tired] The truth is that being a COO isn't what I thought it would be, just endless, [mechanically], spreadsheets and firing people to meet profit margins.
655. [gently] You always did chase the, [curious], bigger picture while I was happy perfecting the, [contentedly], perfect sourdough starter, and maybe that's why we worked so well together. [chuckle]
Character 1: [vulnerable] I've been thinking about what matters, really, [deeply], matters in life, and sitting in that glass tower made me realize I traded, [shaky voice], something real for something that just looked successful.
656. [sincere] The offer still stands to be my business partner if you're, [hopeful], serious about coming back, though the terms might be, [playful], a little different now. [laugh]
Character 1: [relieved] You kept the partnership papers all these years even after I left you, [emotionally], hanging with a loan you had to pay off alone while I was, [guilty], collecting signing bonuses at a startup that doesn't even exist anymore.
657. [firmly] Those papers are in the same drawer where I keep the photo from our grand opening plans, next to the, [melancholic], business cards we never got to print.
Character 1: [determined] I have enough from the acquisition to invest properly this time, no loans, no, [confident], outside investors trying to change our vision.
658. [thoughtful] Um, you know, I mean, the thing is, er, I've learned to run this place, [proudly], my way, and bringing you back means, [cautiously], giving up some of that control I've gotten used to, well.
Character 1: [honestly] I'm not the same person who left, and I understand if you can't, [trembling], trust me with your life's work again.
659. Well, um, maybe we both needed to, [wisely], grow separately before we could truly work together, and, er, maybe this is actually, [optimistic], perfect timing after all.
Character 1: The corporate world taught me systems and efficiency, but I missed the, [passionately], soul of creating something with your own hands. [deep breath]
660. [smiling speaking] Then let's start with you helping me with tomorrow's morning batch, see if those, [teasing], soft CEO hands remember how to shape dough properly. [laugh loudly]
661. [exhausted] You know, I tell people every day—I mean, literally every single day—that grief is like, um, digging a hole. [bitter] You can't rush it, right? Can't force your way through solid earth. [pause] I've buried, what, maybe three thousand people? And honestly, I've got this whole speech down: [warm] "Your loved one is at peace now, the earth will hold them gently," all that. [sarcastic] Real poetic stuff.

[sigh] But here's the thing—when my Sarah died, I just... [trailing off] I couldn't even pick up a shovel for weeks. [quietly] Still can't, actually. Everyone thinks, oh, he must be so wise about death, you know? [laugh] The gravedigger who understands loss! [frustrated] Except I don't—I really, really don't. 

[shaky voice] I give families these perfect words about, er, healing and time and acceptance. [angry] And then I go home to her empty chair and I can't—[pause]—I literally cannot process that she's in the ground I know so well. [very sad] The earth doesn't feel gentle. It feels like, um, like theft. [whispering] Sometimes I think I've buried my ability to grieve along with everyone else's dead. [bitter] Funny how that works, isn't it?
Character 1: [hesitantly] She's been through a lot this year and, [protective], this is her first time in a real salon, so please be, [gentle], patient with her because she's still learning to trust people again.
662. [frozen] Oh my God, um, I mean, is that—I can't believe it's, [shaky voice], actually her after all these years, like, [whispering], I never thought I'd see her again, you know?
Character 1: Wait, um, do you two know each other somehow because she's, [confused], looking at you like she's seen a ghost or something, I mean, what's happening here?
663. [trembling] I, uh, I used to know her, like, a really long time ago before, [trailing off], before everything changed...
Character 1: Look, er, whatever history you have with her, I mean, [stern], she's fragile right now and, [firmly], I won't let anyone hurt her again, not after everything she's been through, you know? [protective stance]
664. [crying while speaking] She's my sister.
Character 1: [shocked] Your sister—but, um, she said her siblings were all, [quietly], gone or dead, I mean, where have you been all this time, you know?
665. [regretful] I ran away from the foster system when I turned eighteen and, [bitter], left her behind because I couldn't take it anymore.
Character 1: [angrily] You left a twelve-year-old alone in that system while you, [accusatory], saved yourself, and now you're just, [disgusted], standing here cutting hair like nothing happened?
666. [defensive] I tried to go back for her but they'd already, [voice breaking], moved her to another home and wouldn't tell me where because I wasn't, [defeated], her legal guardian anymore. [sobs]
Character 1: [empathetically] Listen, um, I didn't know the whole story, but she's been, [gently], self-harming and cutting her own hair for years, like, refusing to let anyone touch her, you know?
667. She used to let me braid her hair every night before, [nostalgic], bed when we were kids.
Character 1: Well, um, maybe that's why she finally agreed to come here today, like, [thoughtful], maybe somehow she knew or sensed you'd be here, I mean, [hopeful], maybe this is her way of reaching out, you know? [pause]
668. [tearfully] Can I please just try to, [desperate], talk to her and explain everything?
Character 1: That's her choice. [firm]
669. [nervously] I know, um, I have no right to ask for forgiveness after, well, [ashamed], abandoning her like that, you know? [sigh]
Character 1: [carefully] She's been in therapy for two years and we've worked, [proudly], so hard to get her to this point where she can even, [warmly], leave the house, so please don't undo all that progress. [protective]
670. [sincerely] I've been saving money for three years to, [determined], hire a private investigator to find her and make things right somehow.
Character 1: [softly] Well she's here now and she needs, [compassionate], both of us to be strong for her, not fall apart with our own, [wise], guilt and regrets, because this moment is about her healing. [resolute]
671. [grateful] Thank you for taking care of her when I, [remorseful], couldn't, for being the guardian she needed when her own, [emotional], family failed her so completely.
Character 1: [shaky voice] S'il vous plaît, euh, j'ai besoin de me cacher ici parce que, [anxious], ils sont juste derrière moi et je veux dire, [whispering], s'ils me trouvent je suis morte. [gasp]
672. [warm] Eh bien, euh, quelle chance que vous ayez trébuché dans, [curious], ma tente de spectacle juste au moment où j'étais, disons, [playful], en train de préparer mon numéro de disparition—même si je soupçonne que le vôtre est plus, vous savez, [quietly], urgent que théâtral.
Character 1: [desperate] Écoutez, je sais que c'est, euh, dingue mais je vous jure que je ne suis pas, [trembling], dangereuse—j'ai juste été témoin de quelque chose que je n'aurais pas dû voir et maintenant, ben, [frustrated], ils veulent me faire taire définitivement.
673. [commanding] Mettez-vous derrière ce panneau de miroir et ne, [stern], bougez pas avant que je vous fasse signe.
Character 1: Le truc c'est que je les entends, [nervously], qui se rapprochent et s'ils fouillent cette tente, [panicking], on va toutes les deux finir, [very quietly], enterrées dans le désert.
674. [confidently] Faites-moi confiance.
Character 1: Je veux dire, vous ne comprenez pas—ce ne sont pas juste, [angry], des voyous ordinaires, ce sont des professionnels qui, euh, [bitter], font vraiment disparaître les gens. [sigh]
675. [amused] Ma chère fugitive, ça fait 30 ans que je fais, disons, [mocking], disparaître des choses, et contrairement à vos poursuivants, ben, [cheerful], je peux les faire réapparaître dans des endroits bien plus intéressants.
Character 1: [confused] Attendez, euh, vous êtes vraiment en train de suggérer que vous pouvez, [hesitantly], téléporter mes chasseurs avec une sorte de, disons, [skeptical], tour de magie parce que c'est complètement fou même pour quelqu'un d'aussi désespérée que, vous savez, moi en ce moment.
676. [mysteriously] Tout bon magicien sait que le vrai truc n'est pas de faire, [slow], disparaître quelque chose—c'est de contrôler où le public, [empathetically], regarde pendant qu'on le fait. [chuckle]
Character 1: [relieved] Alors vous allez, euh, détourner leur attention pendant que je, ben, [hopeful], m'échappe par derrière ?
677. [purposeful] Non, vous allez faire partie du spectacle—mon assistante qui se fait, [excited], scier en deux pendant qu'ils regardent, convaincus que vous n'êtes qu'une, [theatrical], autre artiste.
Character 1: [terrified] Vous voulez que je monte dans une boîte et que vous me, [loudly], sciez dedans pendant que des tueurs regardent ?
678. [reassuring] La beauté de l'illusion c'est que, euh, ce qui paraît dangereux est souvent, [gentle], l'option la plus sûre, et puis, disons, [smiling speaking], vous préférez affronter leurs vraies balles ? [laugh]
Character 1: [resigned] D'accord, mais si ça tourne mal et que je me fais vraiment, [grimly], couper en deux, je hanterai votre tente pour toujours. [groan]
679. [delighted] Oh j'ai déjà joué devant des fantômes—ils sont, euh, [joking], très radins pour les pourboires mais ils ne chahutent jamais, et de toute façon, [dramatic], la vraie question c'est si vous pouvez, ben, [whispering loudly], avoir l'air terrifiée de façon convaincante.
Character 1: [sarcastic] Vu que je suis vraiment terrifiée en ce moment, euh, je pense que je peux, [exhausted], réussir à avoir l'air effrayée pendant que vous agitez une scie autour de, disons, [dryly], mon abdomen.
680. [formal] Mesdames et messieurs, bienvenue à cette représentation spéciale de ce soir, [passionate], où la réalité elle-même devient, [mysteriously], douteuse et où même la mort pourrait n'être qu'une autre, [trailing off], illusion...
Character 1: [whispering] Ils sont là.
681. Maintenant regardez attentivement mon adorable assistante, [flamboyant], entrer dans la boîte aux mystères où l'impossible, [hypnotic], devient possible et où les chasseurs deviennent, [satisfied], les chassés.
Character 1: Maman m'a dit de venir te voir mais, [defensive], franchement c'est encore un sermon sur comment je suis en train de, [frustrated], gâcher ma vie et j'ai déjà entendu tout ça, [bitter], des autres.
682. [calm] Ben, euh, je suis pas là pour faire la morale parce que, [empathetically], j'étais exactement à ta place quand j'avais 17 ans et, euh, [slowly], tout le monde m'avait abandonnée aussi, tu vois?
Character 1: [skeptical] Ouais mais, euh, toi t'as pas été prise avec 90 grammes et, [anxious], risqué l'exclusion pendant que tes parents, euh, [whispering], menacent de t'envoyer en pension militaire ou pire.
683. En fait j'ai été prise avec 2 kilos dans mon casier et j'ai passé, [regretful], 6 mois en centre éducatif fermé avant que quelqu'un dans la famille accepte même de, [quietly], me regarder ce qui explique pourquoi ta mère, [trailing off], m'a appelée moi plutôt que ton père.
Character 1: [surprised] Attends tu, [shocked], dealais aussi? [pause]
684. [honest] Pas juste dealer mais je dirigeais tout un réseau dans 3 lycées jusqu'à ce que tout, [heavily], s'effondre et que je perde tout y compris ma, [sad], meilleure amie qui a fait une overdose. [sigh]
Character 1: [confused] Mais, euh, maintenant t'as genre 3 entreprises et tu conduis cette Tesla et, ben, [curious], tout le monde fait comme si t'étais la réussite de la famille alors, euh, [hesitantly], comment c'est possible ça? [long pause]
685. [warm] Ben, euh, ça m'a pris 10 ans à bosser dans le bâtiment tout en passant mon équivalent du bac et, [determined], ensuite des cours du soir à la fac, tu vois?
Character 1: [angry] Tout le monde arrête pas de dire que j'ai du potentiel mais après ils me, [mocking], suspendent et m'interdisent tout ce qui compte vraiment, [very quietly], pour moi. [groan]
686. [offering] Écoute, euh, je connais un programme qui est pas une pension militaire mais, [gently], c'est spécifiquement pour les jeunes qui ont besoin d'un cadre tout en, ben, [thoughtful], finissant leurs études, tu vois? [clearing throat]
Character 1: [shaky voice] Euh, je sais pas.
687. [encouraging] La différence entre nous c'est que t'as été prise à 17 ans au lieu de, [serious], 18 ce qui veut dire que t'as encore des options que j'avais pas, [passionately], quand ils m'ont jugée comme adulte. [laugh]
Character 1: [hopeful] Alors, euh, tu penses vraiment qu'il y a encore, [nervous], un moyen de sortir de ce merdier, enfin? [sniffle]
688. [firmly] Ben, euh, oui.
Character 1: Le truc c'est que personne croit que je peux, [embarrassed], changer parce que j'ai merdé tellement de fois que même mes profs ont, [despondent], laissé tomber et ont commencé à m'ignorer complètement en, [mumbling], cours.
689. [confidently] C'est exactement ce que je ressentais jusqu'à ce qu'une personne décide d', [sincerely], investir en moi malgré mon casier.
Character 1: [vulnerable] Tu serais prête à être cette, [pleading], personne pour moi?
690. [tender] Ben, euh, j'ai déjà parlé à ton proviseur et, [relieved], je l'ai convaincu de te laisser finir le semestre si, ben, [intentional], tu acceptes des tests de dépistage hebdomadaires et un suivi psy, tu vois? [exhale]
Character 1: [grateful] T'es déjà allée te battre pour moi alors que j'ai été qu'une source de, [ashamed], problèmes pour cette famille et que j'ai fait comme si je m'en, [crying while speaking], foutais de décevoir tout le monde y compris, [very sad], toi que je connais à peine.
691. [loving] Petite, je me vois en toi ce qui est à la fois, [concerned], terrifiant et exactement la raison pour laquelle je vais m'assurer que tu ne, [determined], répètes pas mes erreurs parce que la famille n'abandonne pas la, [strong], famille même quand tous les autres le font. [deep breath]
Character 1: [shocked] I never thought I'd see this town again, [shaky voice], let alone someone who might actually remember me after all these years.
692. [warm] You probably don't recognize me since I was only eight when you, [hesitantly], left with nothing but that old guitar case. [pause]
Character 1: [very quietly] Wait, um, you're Sarah's daughter—I mean, you're the little girl who, well, used to sit on the porch steps listening to me, er, practice those old folk songs every evening.
693. [emotional] Yeah, um, I'm Emma and, [crying while speaking], you were the only adult who ever really listened when I talked about, like, my dreams of becoming a writer, you know. [sigh]
Character 1: Your mother and I had our differences but you were always, [regretful], this bright light in that house that made everything bearable.
694. [bitter] Mom never understood why I kept asking about you, um, where you went or, [frustrated], if you ever thought about us—well, about me—after you disappeared one night without, [very sad], even saying goodbye, you know. [groan]
Character 1: [apologetic] Leaving without a proper goodbye was the most, [anxious], cowardly thing I've ever done but staying would have meant, [whispering], watching your mother marry someone else while I, [slowly], withered away in that small town.
695. [curious] I kept that notebook you gave me, um, the one with all your lyrics and, [passionately], those little drawings in the margins—I mean, I've read every word probably, [excited], a thousand times over the years. [laugh]
Character 1: [surprised] You still have that old thing after twenty years—I thought your mother would have, [confused], thrown out everything I left behind the moment I walked out that door, [trailing off], especially anything that might remind you of me.
696. She tried to, um, but I hid it under my mattress and, well, [empathetically], read your words whenever I needed to remember that someone once believed I could be more than just, you know, another small-town disappointment.
Character 1: [moved] Emma, I mean, seeing you now all grown up and, well, [proudly], clearly having become your own person despite everything, it's like, um, witnessing a miracle I don't deserve. [chuckle]
697. [sincerely] You know, um, I became a writer just like I told you I would, and, [cheerful], my first book is actually dedicated to, well, 'the wandering musician who taught me that leaving isn't always, you know, abandonment.' [cough]
Character 1: That's beautiful and more grace than I deserve considering how I just, [ashamed], vanished from your life when you needed stability, [guilty], not another adult walking away from their, [very melancholic], responsibilities.
698. [gently] Sometimes the best thing you can teach a child is that, [thoughtful], it's okay to choose yourself when staying would destroy you.
Character 1: [whispered] Um, I mean, thank you.
699. [hopeful] So, um, maybe we could grab coffee and, [nervous], I could show you that first book—I mean, if you have time before you, well, disappear again. [laugh softly]
Character 1: [determined] I'm actually playing at the old café tomorrow night and it would mean, [happy], everything to see you there in the audience again.
700. [tearful] Um, I'll be there.
Character 1: [relieved] You know, um, I've played in countless venues over these twenty years but, [emotional], nothing ever felt as right as those evenings on your mother's porch with you as my, like, only audience, [voice breaking], believing every word I sang was somehow just for you.
701. [smiling speaking] Well, um, maybe they were—I mean, maybe that's why I kept that notebook all these years, [understanding], knowing someday you'd come back and we'd both be ready for, [peaceful], whatever this becomes, you know. [deep breath]
Character 1: Chaque matin je viens ici dans cette, [regretful], cour où l'échafaud se tenait autrefois, et je dépose des fleurs, [quietly], pour chaque nom dont je me souviens encore, même si certains visages ont, [trembling], heureusement commencé à s'estomper. [sigh]
702. [curious] Excusez-moi madame, je cherche des lieux pour un documentaire sur, [confused], les sites historiques de justice, et j'ai remarqué que vous semblez, [hesitantly], connaître cet endroit intimement—pourriez-vous partager sa signification?
Character 1: Cet endroit garde 137 âmes qui sont passées entre mes, [shaky voice], mains entre 1982 et 2003.
703. [whispering] Vous étiez la—
Character 1: Bourreau d'État, oui, though that title carries, [bitter], weight no documentary could ever capture, et j'ai passé chaque jour depuis à essayer de, [exhausted], honorer ceux que j'étais légalement obligée d'envoyer. [pause]
704. [warm] Je ne savais pas, euh, que quelqu'un venait encore, je veux dire, ici pour se souvenir d'eux, et bien, votre présence ici témoigne de quelque chose, [empathetically], de profond sur le fait de porter ce fardeau, something that, er, transcends the simple narrative of justice qu'on raconte habituellement, [slowly], dans nos films.
Character 1: [monotone] Chaque exécution suivait le même protocole: vérification d'identité à l'aube, [mechanically], lecture de la sentence, demander les derniers mots, et puis l', [very quietly], acte irréversible qui me visite encore dans mes rêves où ils, [trailing off], me demandent pourquoi...
705. [anxious] Madame, je veux dire, considéreriez-vous, euh, partager votre histoire devant la caméra parce que, bien, the world needs to hear from someone who, [passionate], lived inside that system?
Character 1: Vous savez, les gens veulent toujours entendre parler de la, [frustrated], mécanique de la mort, mais euh, ce qui me hante le plus c'est, er, les vivants—les mères qui, [crying while speaking], s'effondraient dans la salle d'observation, the children who wrote letters asking, well, why their parent had to die, et je veux dire, les gardiens qui démissionnaient après leur première, [hollow], journée d'exécution.
706. [apologetic] Je comprends que ça doit être incroyablement difficile d'en parler, et je réalise que ma demande peut sembler, [ashamed], insensible vu le poids que vous portez, but documenting your experience could help people, [sincerely], understand the true cost of capital punishment au-delà des statistiques.
Character 1: [relieved] Peut-être qu'il est temps, euh, je veux dire, après 20 ans de silence, maybe speaking about it would, er, help me stop seeing their faces chaque fois que je, [whispering loudly], ferme les yeux. [long pause]
707. [gentle] On pourrait structurer les entretiens comme vous le sentez, taking breaks whenever needed, et en se concentrant sur, [respectful], n'importe quels aspects que vous êtes à l'aise de partager.
Character 1: [firmly] Trois conditions alors.
708. Tout ce dont vous avez besoin, je veux dire, euh, we want to honor your story et, bien, les mémoires de ceux qui sont, [sad], morts ici. [sniffle]
Character 1: [formal] D'abord, vous filmez ici où ça s'est passé pour que les spectateurs comprennent la, [angry], réalité physique de la mort sanctionnée par l'État, et deuxièmement, euh, on inclut les noms de chaque personne exécutée parce que, er, they deserve to be more than statistics.
709. [eagerly] Bien sûr, absolument.
Character 1: [determined] Et troisièmement, bien, vous interviewez les familles aussi—les familles des victimes qui, er, demandaient justice et les familles des condamnés qui, euh, ont perdu des êtres chers, because this story isn't just mine to, [broken], tell. [gasp softly]
710. Ça créerait un portrait complet de comment la peine capitale, [thoughtful], se répand à travers des communautés entières, affecting everyone it touches in ways that, [deeply moved], never truly heal.
Character 1: La guérison n'est pas possible quand on a pris la vie légalement au nom de la, [hollow], justice—on apprend juste à porter le poids différemment.
711. [very sincerely] Alors assurons-nous que ce documentaire aide les autres à comprendre ce poids, honoring both those who died and those who, [respectful], still live with the consequences d'un système qui leur a demandé de tuer.
Character 1: Alors, euh, j'ai finalement essayé cette appli de détecteur de métaux et, tu sais, les lectures étaient, franchement, complètement incohérentes.
712. Oh là là, ces applis sont, bon, totalement pas fiables mais [laugh hard] j'adore que tu l'aies vraiment essayée! Est-ce que des chiffres apparaissaient sur l'écran, ou ça bipait juste au hasard sur tout ce qui était métallique autour de toi?
Character 1: Ça affichait sans arrêt [speeding up] 78, 45, 92, genre, ça changeait constamment et, euh, j'avais aucune idée de ce que ça voulait dire.
713. Ouais, alors ces chiffres sont censés être, hmm, des lectures de conductivité mais, en fait, les vrais détecteurs utilisent une échelle de 1 à 99. Le fer apparaît généralement autour de 10-35, tandis que les pièces d'argent sont plutôt vers 88-95 sur la plupart des machines.
Character 1: Attends, tu t'y connais vraiment en détection de métaux?
714. Tu te souviens quand, euh, Papa était obsédé par [bored] la chasse au trésor et nous traînait à la plage tous les weekends? I mean, I picked up way more than I wanted to know about VDI numbers and discrimination patterns.
Character 1: Oh c'est vrai, j'avais, euh, complètement oublié cette phase, mais, tu sais, il avait pas trouvé quelque chose de valeur une fois?
715. Il a trouvé une bague de promo de 1967 qui affichait 79 sur son détecteur! On a passé trois semaines à chercher le propriétaire dans les archives de l'annuaire, et le gars était tellement content qu'il a pleuré.
Character 1: C'est vraiment touchant, ça. L'or apparaîtrait à quel chiffre?
716. L'or c'est compliqué parce que ça peut aller de 40 à 60 selon le carat et la taille. Les languettes de canettes enregistrent dans la même gamme, which is why beach hunters dig up so much trash.
Character 1: Alors l'appli qui montre des chiffres aléatoires, ça a plus de sens maintenant.
717. Les applis de téléphone peuvent pas vraiment détecter le métal correctement, genre, elles utilisent juste le magnétomètre fait pour, bon, les lectures de boussole, alors, franchement, les chiffres qu'elles affichent sont basically meaningless.
Character 1: C'est, euh, assez décevant puisque, tu sais, j'espérais, en fait, trouver un trésor enterré dans le jardin.
718. Si t'es sérieuse, j'ai encore le vieux détecteur Garrett de Papa dans mon garage. It's from 2015 but it works great and shows proper target ID numbers.
Character 1: Tu pourrais, euh, m'aider à apprendre comment l'utiliser, je veux dire, si t'as le temps ce weekend?
719. Absolument! On peut commencer dans ton jardin et je t'apprendrai ce que tous les chiffres veulent dire. Fair warning though, you'll probably find about fifty bottle caps before anything interesting.
Character 1: Quels chiffres je devrais, bon, vraiment surveiller si je cherche, tu sais, quelque chose de valeur?
720. Concentre-toi sur les lectures constantes entre 75 et 95, [gasp softly] ce sont tes meilleures chances pour des pièces d'argent ou des bijoux. Skip anything below 40 unless you want a collection of rusty nails and aluminum foil.
Character 1: Ça a l'air bien plus compliqué que ce que je pensais.
721. C'est vraiment pas si difficile une fois que tu, euh, prends le coup, mais [shouting] quoi que tu fasses, creuse pas dans le jardin de Maman sans permission parce que, franchement, elle va absolument nous tuer toutes les deux!
Character 1: I was reading about capital structure and [long pause] realized I basically understand nothing about finance.
722. Well, capital structure is, you know, just how a company finances itself through, um, debt and equity. It's basically about finding the right mix between borrowing money and selling shares to investors.
Character 1: So, like, if I wanted to [monotone] start a lemonade stand, I guess, I'd need to, er, optimize my capital structure too?
723. Actually, yes! Even a lemonade stand has, uh, capital structure decisions like whether you, I mean, borrow twenty bucks from your parents or, well, get your siblings to invest for a share of profits.
Character 1: What if I just steal the lemons? That's free capital right there.
724. That's not how finance works at all! You'd still have opportunity costs, potential legal liabilities, and you're completely ignoring the reputational risk to your theoretical lemonade empire.
Character 1: My theoretical lemonade empire sounds very sophisticated.
725. The optimal capital [stuttering] st-structure depends on, hmm, things like tax benefits from debt, but, you know, also the risk of financial distress if you, er, borrow too much.
Character 1: Oh yes, the famous [mocking] Modigliani-Miller theorem that, um, nobody actually understands, right? Including, honestly, probably Modigliani and Miller themselves?
726. They absolutely understood it! The theorem states that, well, in perfect markets with no taxes, capital structure is, actually, irrelevant to firm value, but, I mean, real markets have all sorts of imperfections.
Character 1: Perfect markets? Like a farmers market but for stocks?
727. No, perfect markets mean no [quickly] transaction costs no taxes perfect information and rational investors which obviously doesn't exist but it's a useful theoretical starting point.
Character 1: Sounds like economists just making stuff up honestly.
728. It's not made up! These models help us understand why companies choose certain debt-to-equity ratios and how those choices affect their cost of capital and overall value.
Character 1: So, um, if I maxed out seventeen credit cards to, like, fund my startup, that would be, er, aggressive capital structure?
729. That would be insane! Credit card debt has, you know, interest rates around twenty percent, so, basically, you'd need returns higher than that just to, hmm, break even on the financing costs.
Character 1: But think of all the airline miles I'd earn!
730. Look, the thing is, [relieved] you're joking but, actually, some entrepreneurs really do fund startups with credit cards when, well, they can't get traditional financing.
Character 1: Wait, really? That sounds, uh, incredibly risky and, honestly, kind of desperate.
731. It's definitely risky but, hmm, sometimes it works out - like, the founders of Under Armour and Spanx both used, er, credit cards initially, though I really wouldn't recommend it as, you know, a primary strategy.
Character 1: Tu as fini de tracer les plans architecturaux pour le projet Henderson ?
732. J'étais, euh, en train de bosser dessus mais [very sad] franchement, les fichiers AutoCAD se sont corrompus et, tu sais, j'ai perdu environ trois heures de boulot.
Character 1: Oh non, tu n'avais pas de backups ?
733. Ben, d'habitude je sauvegarde sur Dropbox toutes les heures mais, euh, aujourd'hui j'étais distraite et, en gros, j'ai oublié d'activer la sauvegarde automatique. La tablette Wacom me faisait des misères aussi, donc je veux dire, tout est parti en vrille d'un coup.
Character 1: On devrait peut-être, euh, repasser à l'ancienne tablette Huion ? Elle était, genre, plus fiable même si, en fait, la sensibilité à la pression était pas aussi bonne.
734. Le truc c'est que la Huion marche pas bien avec, hmm, le nouveau moteur de traçage d'Adobe Illustrator, et, ben, c'est exactement ce que le client a demandé qu'on utilise pour la vectorisation.
Character 1: Alors, attends, on peut pas juste, euh, utiliser Inkscape à la place ? C'est gratuit et, j'imagine, plutôt correct pour, tu sais, le traçage de base.
735. Inkscape c'est bien pour les amateurs mais [condescending] les professionnels utilisent des logiciels standards de l'industrie comme Illustrator ou CorelDRAW pour une bonne raison. Les outils de précision et les capacités de traitement par lots sont dans des ligues complètement différentes.
Character 1: Pas la peine d'être cassante.
736. Tu as raison, je suis désolée. C'est juste que je suis frustrée parce que Vector Magic aurait pu faire la conversion initiale en quelques minutes, mais l'abonnement a expiré la semaine dernière et personne l'a renouvelé.
Character 1: On peut pas juste utiliser l'essai gratuit avec un autre email ?
737. C'est contraire à leurs conditions d'utilisation, et puis de toute façon, on a besoin de la fonction de traitement par lots qui vient seulement avec la version complète. En plus les plans Henderson ont des tracés vraiment complexes qui nécessitent des ajustements manuels de toute façon.
Character 1: Et si on utilisait cette table lumineuse dans la réserve pour le faire à l'ancienne ?
738. En fait, cette vieille table lumineuse Artograph est, euh, cassée et [sad] ça me rappelle, ben, quand Papa m'apprenait le dessin technique avant que tout devienne numérique, tu vois ?
Character 1: Je savais pas que ton père était dans le dessin technique.
739. Il a été architecte pendant trente ans avant de prendre sa retraite. Il traçait des plans à la main avec ces stylos techniques Staedtler et tout, bien avant que les logiciels de CAO prennent le contrôle de l'industrie.
Character 1: Ça explique pourquoi tu es tellement perfectionniste avec les épaisseurs de trait.
740. Je veux dire, il disait toujours que, euh, le bon dessin technique c'était, en gros, respecter le métier que tu utilises, hmm, des outils traditionnels ou numériques.
Character 1: Bon, on devrait peut-être juste, euh, dire à Henderson pour le retard ? Je suis sûre qu'ils vont, genre, comprendre si on explique ce qui, euh, s'est passé avec les fichiers.
741. Ouais, tu as sûrement raison. Henderson est client depuis cinq ans maintenant, et ils savent qu'on fait du travail de qualité même quand des problèmes techniques nous ralentissent de temps en temps.
Character 1: Alors, euh, on pense à, basically, sortir les enfants de l'école traditionnelle l'année prochaine.
742. Oh wow, vous pensez au homeschooling? Qu'est-ce qui vous a [cough] fait considérer l'éducation alternative? I've been reading about the different approaches families take, quand ils quittent le système traditionnel.
Character 1: Pas exactement le homeschooling, [child-like] plutôt le unschooling où les enfants dirigent leur propre apprentissage.
743. Le unschooling, c'est fascinant! So you'd be letting them follow their interests completely, sans curriculum fixe? Comment tu gères des choses comme les maths ou l'écriture qu'ils pourraient ne pas naturellement aimer?
Character 1: Ben, genre, l'idée c'est qu'ils apprendront les maths quand ils, tu sais, en auront besoin pour quelque chose qui les intéresse.
744. Ça fait du sens en théorie, mais, bon, et si ils, en fait, ne développent jamais un intérêt qui nécessite l'algèbre? Est-ce que tu as, euh, contacté des familles qui font du unschooling depuis des années?
Character 1: On a rejoint des groupes en ligne mais on n'a encore rencontré personne localement.
745. You should definitely find a local community! Tu as pensé à comment documenter leur apprentissage pour les applications universitaires? Certains états ont des exigences assez strictes même pour les unschoolers.
Character 1: C'est ce qui inquiète mon partenaire constamment.
746. C'est une inquiétude valide, but there are portfolios and narrative transcripts that work really well. Quel âge ont tes enfants? L'approche varie vraiment selon qu'ils sont au primaire ou approchent du lycée.
Character 1: 8 et 11 ans.
747. Des âges parfaits pour commencer! Ils sont, hmm, excités par l'idée ou, je veux dire, ils ont des réserves sur le fait de quitter leurs amis à l'école?
Character 1: La plus jeune est, genre, ravie mais la plus grande est, euh, inquiète de manquer des choses, anyway.
748. C'est tellement normal, et, honestly, l'aspect social est ce avec quoi la plupart des familles luttent au début. Tu as, euhh, regardé les co-ops de homeschool ou les groupes de unschooling qui organisent des rencontres régulières?
Character 1: On est, le truc c'est qu'on recherche différents groupes mais, donc, everything seems pretty scattered around here.
749. Oh, err, je viens de me rappeler que ma cousine [very excited] dirige un centre de ressources pour unschooling à environ 40 minutes d'ici! Ils font, genre, des rassemblements hebdomadaires et ils ont même des maker spaces où les enfants travaillent sur des projets ensemble.
Character 1: Vraiment? C'est, bon alors, exactement ce dont on a besoin, I guess.
750. Je peux définitivement te connecter! They have families who've been unschooling for over a decade. Tu travailles de la maison, ou tu devras trouver une solution pour la supervision?
Character 1: Je travaille à distance 3 jours, mais c'est juste que, on n'a pas encore trouvé pour les autres jours, ah.
751. Mmm, tu sais, on devrait prendre un café et [flirtatious] je peux te raconter tout ce que j'ai appris en regardant le parcours de ma cousine. It's, really, quite an adventure when done right.
