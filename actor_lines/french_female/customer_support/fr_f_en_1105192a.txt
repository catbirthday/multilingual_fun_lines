=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Do you know who I am? I'm the—actually, let me just—I'm the athletic director at Westfield University.

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Um, hello Mr.—er, sorry, I didn't catch your, uh, your name there, but let me just, um, pull up your account and, uh, we'll get this sorted out for you, okay? So if you could just, um, give me your account number or, uh, maybe the order reference?

Customer [en]: I think it's... hmm, let me see here... probably RFQ-2847 or something like that?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so um, that's actually, uh—wait, let me just—okay so RFQ-2847-TK92, and I can see here that, um, you've been transferred... oh wow, uh, three times already today? That's, er, definitely not the experience we want for you, and um, I'm really sorry about that.

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, so like, three different departments, and uh, nobody seems to know, um, where my equipment order even is.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, let me dig into this because, uh, this is like a... what's the word... a priority institutional account, and um, I can see you ordered—er, sorry, let me scroll—forty-seven items with purchase order PON-88459-QD on October 12th, is that right?

Customer [en]: That's the one. Sort of ridiculous that nobody can tell me where it is, don't you think?

Customer Support [en]: Um, absolutely, and uh, I'm actually seeing something really, um, interesting here—so your order got, uh, split into three shipments, and um, it looks like tracking number TRK-9901245-A went to—wait no, sorry, that's the wrong—let me just double-check this for you.

Customer [en]: Oh great, so um, like, even you don't know? Uh, this is just, um, perfect.

Customer Support [en]: No no, I've, um, I've got it! So uh, this is actually—oh! I see what happened here—your order got, er, flagged in our bulk processing system under code BLK-77234, and um, someone marked it as residential instead of institutional, which is, uh, why nobody could find it.

Customer [en]: I manage, what, probably a twelve million dollar budget? And you're telling me it's marked residential?

Customer Support [en]: I know, it's, um, it's completely wrong and uh, I'm fixing it right now—so the good news is, er, all three shipments with tracking TRK-9901245-A, TRK-9901246-A, and TRK-9901247-A are actually, um, already at your receiving dock as of, uh, let me see... yesterday at 2:47 PM.

Customer [en]: Wait, they're—no wait, actually—they're already here?

Customer Support [en]: Um, yes! So like, they've been signed for by, uh, someone with initials JMK at your, um, at your loading dock, and uh, I'm sending you the, er, the delivery confirmations now to reference number CNF-445789-WD22.

Customer [en]: Um, so you're saying, like, I've been on the phone for, uh, two hours total today and they're, um, already here?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, so um, the issue was that, uh, because of the residential flag, the system wasn't, er, wasn't linking it to your institutional account properly, which is like... what's the word... a database mismatch thing, but um, I've corrected it now under update code UPD-123477-R.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if this happens again? I mean, probably will, knowing my luck.

Customer Support [en]: Oh! So, um, I'm actually adding a, uh, a special routing note to your account—it's like, er, a VIP flag basically—with code VIP-8834521, and um, I'm also giving you my direct extension which is, uh, 4479, so you can, um, bypass the regular queue entirely.

Customer [en]: Let me see here... okay so that means... yeah, I guess that works.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect! And um, just so you know, I've also, uh, credited your account—it's showing as credit CRD-90128-KL—for, er, for all the trouble today, and um, that should appear within, uh, twenty-four to forty-eight hours, okay?
