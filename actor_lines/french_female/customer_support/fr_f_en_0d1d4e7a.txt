Customer [en]: Good afternoon. I need to process a return for a laptop I purchased in September.

Customer Support [en]: Good afternoon. I'd be happy to help you with that. May I have your order number or the email address associated with your purchase?

Customer [en]: The order number is LP-8274-QM. I realize it's been over thirty days.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I've located your order LP-8274-QM from September 12th. Our standard return window is thirty days, which would have ended October 12th. May I ask what prompted the return request?

Customer [en]: The battery life has been significantly shorter than advertised. I expected better performance from this price point.

Customer Support [en]: I understand your concern about the battery performance. While we're past the standard return window, let me check what options are available. The laptop model TH550-PRO you purchased is still under our one-year manufacturer warranty.

Customer [en]: I appreciate that. What would the warranty process involve versus a return?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. For warranty service, we'd arrange a diagnostic through our technical support team at 888-742-5500. If they confirm a battery defect, we'll either repair or replace the unit at no charge. The process typically takes seven to ten business days.

Customer [en]: That's reasonable. Would it be possible to explore any return exceptions given the circumstances?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. Let me review your account history. I see you've been a customer since 2019 with account ID CUS-4492-BNK. Given your loyalty and the nature of the issue, I can submit an exception request to our returns department.

Customer [en]: That would be excellent. What information would you need from me to process that?

Customer Support [en]: I'll need a brief description of the battery performance issue for case reference RTN-9983-XLP. Can you describe how long the battery currently lasts versus the advertised specifications?

Customer [en]: The specifications indicated twelve hours. I'm getting approximately four hours with standard office applications.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you for that information. That's a significant discrepancy. I've documented this in your exception request RTN-9983-XLP and escalated it to our returns management team for priority review.

Customer [en]: When should I expect to hear back about the decision?

Customer Support [en]: Of course.

Customer [en]: Will I receive email confirmation about this exception request today?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, you'll receive an email confirmation within the next hour to your registered address with reference number RTN-9983-XLP. The returns team will respond within forty-eight hours with their decision and, if approved, include a prepaid shipping label.

Customer [en]: Perfect. I appreciate your help finding a solution despite the timing issue.

Customer Support [en]: You're very welcome. I've also added a note to your account documenting the battery performance issue for future reference. If you don't receive the confirmation email within an hour, please call us back at 888-742-5500 and reference case RTN-9983-XLP.
