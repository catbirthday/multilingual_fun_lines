=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, yeah so I'm calling about—wait let me—I'm calling about my reimbursement check that never... hmm, let me think here...

Customer Support [en]: Hi there! Um, I can definitely help with that. So, uh, just need to pull up your account here—what's your employee ID number? I think we can, um, track that down pretty quickly.

Customer [en]: It's uh... 447—no wait, 474-829. The uniform reimbursement.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, um, 474-829... okay so I'm seeing here, hmm, your last reimbursement request RMB-9042-TK was, uh, processed on the 15th. Should've arrived by now, I think.

Customer [en]: Right so that's—I mean that's the problem—it never showed up and I'm getting, um, pretty frustrated here.

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Um, I totally understand that frustration. Let me just, uh, check the payment status here... REF-9042-TK shows, hmm, mailed on the 17th to your address on file.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means—wait, hmm, what if it got lost? I mean I deliver mail, I know things disappear.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: Can you just—no wait actually—can you reissue it today? Like, um, I don't have time for all this back and forth.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I can definitely start that process. The thing is, uh, for check CHK-8827-MN over fifty dollars, I need to, hmm, verify it wasn't cashed first. Takes maybe, um, two business days?

Customer [en]: Two days? I mean, do you know how long I've already—sorry, I mean—this is ridiculous.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know. Um, actually, let me see if... hmm, there might be another option here. Can I, uh, put you on a brief hold? Maybe thirty seconds?

Customer [en]: Um, fine but—I mean just—yeah okay whatever, just hurry.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely.

Customer [en]: So? What's the—let me guess—another delay?

Customer Support [en]: No no! So, um, good news actually. I found, uh, an expedite code EXP-2847 that I can apply. We can, hmm, cancel the original and, um, issue direct deposit instead? Should hit by, uh, tomorrow morning.

Customer [en]: Tomorrow? That's—wait no that's actually—hmm, okay so that means I'd have it for Friday?

Customer Support [en]: Yep! Um, I just need to, uh, confirm your direct deposit info. Last four of your account on file is, hmm, 7829?

Customer [en]: That's right. Listen, I'm a mail carrier—I mean we deserve better than lost checks, you know?

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely, I, um, completely agree. You guys work so hard and, uh, this shouldn't happen. So I've noted everything under case CSE-4492-BN and, hmm, added a priority flag. Should be all set by tomorrow!
