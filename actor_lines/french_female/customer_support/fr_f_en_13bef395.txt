=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Hi! Um, so like, hmm, fifth time this year? Let me see here... uh, we're movin' again.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, um, fifth time—that's, uh, that's a lot. I'm gonna—wait, let me pull up your account here—actually, what's your account number or, um, phone number on file?

Customer [en]: It's, uh, wait. Hmm. Which one d'you need? See, that's the thing—

Customer Support [en]: Either one works! I can look you up with—sorry, I mean, um, whatever's easier for you. I know with all the moves it gets, uh... confusing.

Customer [en]: Okay so, um, lemme think... 555-0342? That still right? Or wait, hmm, might be the old one.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, got you right here! Account ACC-7749-MN2. And, um, I can see you've had—oh gosh—yeah, four address changes since January. Military family?

Customer [en]: Yep! Navy wife. Fun times, right? So anyway, um, how quick can we—

Customer Support [en]: Oh, I totally get it. My brother's Air Force, so... yeah, I know, it's ridiculous how often you have to move. Um, so I'm gonna make sure—let me set up something here that'll help. Your new address?

Customer [en]: Um, hmm, 4421 Base Road. But wait. How do I know this won't just... mess everythin' up?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I'm setting you up with our, uh, military family profile code—MIL-PREF-0923—which basically means, um, next time you call? You just give them that code and we can update everything in like... thirty seconds instead of all this.

Customer [en]: Really? That's—hmm, okay but like, why didn't anyone tell me 'bout this before?

Customer Support [en]: Because honestly? Um, half our reps don't even—sorry, they don't know about it. It's not really, uh... advertised. But I'm making sure you're protected for next time.

Customer [en]: Wait, so you're tellin' me, um, there's been a code this whole time? Hmm. Seems suspicious.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know how it sounds. But look, um, I'm putting a note here—NOTE-85542-JK—that says, uh, "frequent military relocations, priority handling required" so even if you don't remember the code, anyone who pulls this up will... you know...

Customer [en]: Okay so, um, lemme get this straight. You're like, actually helpin'? Not just, hmm, readin' a script?

Customer Support [en]: Um, yeah, no, I'm—look, moving five times in a year is, uh, it's insane, and our system makes it worse. So I'm updating your address to 4421 Base Road, confirmation CNF-2290-BASE, and, um, adding every single flag I can to make your life easier because... that's just ridiculous what you're dealing with.

Customer [en]: Ha! Y'know what? I like you. Um, so, hmm, what if we move again next month?

Customer Support [en]: Then you call, give them code MIL-PREF-0923 or reference, um, today's interaction ID INT-445821, and they'll... sorry, WE'LL get you sorted immediately. Also I'm waiving the, uh, the address change fee that's been charged to you the last four times because that's just...

Customer [en]: Wait wait wait. There's been FEES? Um, hmm, nobody said—how much we talkin' here?

Customer Support [en]: So you've been charged, um, fifteen dollars each time—total of sixty dollars—which is, uh, absolutely getting refunded. Credit ref CRD-9901-RFND will show up in, um, three to five days. Military families shouldn't pay to... to update addresses when you're literally serving the country, that's just...
