Customer [en]: So basically your app is having a moment and crashes every time I open it.

Customer Support [en]: Oh man okay I actually—my phone did the exact same thing yesterday with a different app drove me absolutely crazy let me pull up your account real quick what's your email?

Customer [en]: It's like the app loads for two seconds then just dies.

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it so I'm seeing here account ID ACC-7739-PX and yeah we've had—I think maybe fifteen calls about this today you're definitely not alone the dev team pushed an update that's kind of—well it's not great.

Customer [en]: Oh good, so I'm part of an exclusive club of people who can't use their phones.

Customer Support [en]: Right right I know it's—look between you and me they really should've tested this better before rolling it out but I can get you into the beta version BTA-4421-Q that actually works it's what I'm using on my phone.

Customer [en]: Wait so there's a version that works and you're just not giving it to everyone?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so technically—no wait let me—basically the beta's not officially approved for everyone yet but since you're affected by bug report BUG-8823-ML I can authorize it takes like two minutes want me to walk you through it?

Customer [en]: Like do I download something different or... I don't really get how this works.
