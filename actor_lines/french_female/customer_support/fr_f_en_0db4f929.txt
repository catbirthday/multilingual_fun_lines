=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Look, I just—no wait, I mean I placed three sep—three different orders. Yesterday. Can't combine 'em?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, I want to make sure I'm seeing everything correctly. Can I get your, um, what's the... your order confirmation number?

Customer [en]: I got, um, like three of 'em. First one's, uh—sorry, lemme find—it's ORD-4—wait no, RD-482.

Customer Support [en]: ORD-482, okay, um, and just to double-check, that's O-R-D dash four eight two? I'm seeing here that, uh, hmm, actually I need the full number with all the, um, all the characters after that?

Customer [en]: Right. ORD-4827-MP. Other two are—they're somewhere in my email.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so, um, I've got ORD-4827-MP here and, uh, let me see... okay so that one's, hmm, showing as already processed but not shipped yet, which is actually, um, good news for what you're trying to do.

Customer [en]: Good. Yeah. Found 'em—wait, no that's—here. ORD-4829-LC and, um, ORD-4831-PR.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, so, ummm, let me just, uh, make sure I've got all three... ORD-4827-MP, then, um, ORD-4829-LC, and, er, ORD-4831-PR. Is that, hmm, is that everything you wanted to combine?

Customer [en]: That's it. Look, I just, um, I saw the shipping charges after and it's—I mean, it's like sixty bucks total for three packages.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, yeah, so, um, sixty dollars is definitely, uh, that's a lot. Let me see here... hmm, okay so the system's showing me that, um, two of these are in our main warehouse—that's the MP and LC ones—but, uh, the PR order is coming from our, er, our satellite facility.

Customer [en]: So can't do it? 'Cause I really—my kid's birthday, it's all stuff for that.

Customer Support [en]: No no, wait, um, I think I can actually, uh, let me try something here... sometimes if I put in a, hmm, what's it called... a consolidation request? With the code CSL-MERGE-92, I can, um, I can override the facility difference.

Customer [en]: You'd do that? I mean, um, that'd really—yeah. Please.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, so, ummm, I'm putting in the request now and, uh, okay so the system's asking me to... hmm, wait, let me just verify your shipping address real quick? Just to make sure everything, um, everything goes to the right place?

Customer [en]: 447 Elm Street. Austin. 78745.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, 447 Elm Street, Austin, 78745. So, um, good news—the consolidation went through with confirmation number CNF-88293-COMB, and, uh, instead of sixty dollars, you're looking at, hmm, just eighteen fifty for combined shipping.

Customer [en]: Eight—eighteen fifty? That's, um, that's actually great. When's it—no wait—when's delivery?

Customer Support [en]: So with the combined shipping, um, let me check the, uh, the estimated delivery... okay so all three items under tracking number TRK-293847-UPS should arrive by, hmm, Thursday the 15th. Is that, um, is that going to work for the birthday party?

Customer [en]: Thursday works. Um, thanks for actually, uh, helping. Most times they just say no, can't—you know.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, I totally get it, and honestly? Between you and me, the, uh, the consolidation thing isn't something we advertise but, hmm, for birthday parties especially, I always try to make it work. Your receipt number's going to be, um, RCP-77492-B and you should get an email confirmation in about, er, five minutes or so.
