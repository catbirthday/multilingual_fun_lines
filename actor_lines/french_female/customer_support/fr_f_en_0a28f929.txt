=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I need to discuss invoice FNC-8842 which has been placed on hold due to a dispute between my clients.

Customer Support [en]: I see that invoice for $4,750 here in our system. Let me review the hold status and the documentation we have on file.

Customer [en]: The homeowners at 412 Maple Street are disputing the property line, but my work was completed according to the original contract.

Customer Support [en]: I understand the situation. According to the notes on account ACC-5518-MNT, both parties have contacted us regarding the payment authorization, which triggered our automatic dispute protocol.

Customer [en]: What specific steps triggered this hold? I followed all standard procedures and obtained written approval before starting.

Customer Support [en]: The hold was initiated when the secondary party, listed as co-payer on the contract, filed dispute claim DSP-7741 on Tuesday citing property boundary concerns.

Customer [en]: This is affecting my cash flow significantly. What documentation would resolve this from your perspective?

Customer Support [en]: To release the held funds of $4,750, we need either joint written authorization from both parties or a copy of the surveyor's report confirming the fence placement within lot boundaries.

Customer [en]: I have the original survey documentation and the signed work order from the primary homeowner dated three weeks ago.

Customer Support [en]: Excellent. Please submit those documents to our resolution department using reference number REF-9923-KLM, and I can expedite the review process within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: Will the secondary party's objection still prevent payment release even with proper documentation?

Customer Support [en]: Not necessarily. With verified survey documentation showing compliance with property lines, we can process partial release of $3,562.50, which represents 75% of the invoice, while the remaining balance awaits final resolution.

Customer [en]: That would help considerably. Can you explain why only seventy-five percent would be released?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. Our dispute protection policy outlined in section 14.2 of your merchant agreement allows immediate release of undisputed portions while protecting all parties during boundary disputes.

Customer [en]: I see. What happens if the neighbors never reach an agreement on their property line issue?

Customer Support [en]: After 60 days, case number CSE-4421-BND would escalate to our arbitration team, who would make a binding determination based on submitted documentation and local property records.

Customer [en]: Would I need legal representation for that arbitration process, or can I handle it directly?

Customer Support [en]: You can absolutely handle it directly. The arbitration process costs $125, which is typically split between parties, and our team will guide you through each step.

Customer [en]: That's reasonable. Please proceed with the partial release and I'll submit the survey documents within the hour.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. I've initiated the partial release for $3,562.50 to your account ending in 7829, and I'm sending you the secure upload link for your documentation right now.
