Scenario: wanting to transfer service to a new address

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Oh hey! So I'm—wait actually—I think I need to, um, move my service? Yeah, movin' next week!

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, let me see here... okay so between you and me? Moving service is actually one of my favorite things to help with because, um, I can usually sneak in some perks. Let me just pull up your account with reference number ACC-7829-XL94 here.

Customer [en]: Ha! Perks? I like—no wait—I mean, yeah that's great! Movin' to downtown, the big glass tower?

Customer Support [en]: Ohhh nice, the Meridian Tower? Yeah so, um, I'm seeing here that, hmm, we actually have fiber coverage there which means... okay so this is good news, your current plan PLN-4472-B can transfer but I might be able to, uh, upgrade you to our premium tier for the same price.

Customer [en]: Um, wait really? That's—I mean, prob'ly should mention, uh, I'm actually VP at Morrison Tech now so kinda need solid service, you know?

Customer Support [en]: Morrison Tech! Okay so, hmm, let me just... yeah we definitely want to make sure you're set up properly then. Your new address confirmation is ADR-9021-MT55 and, um, I'm actually going to flag this as a priority business transfer even though it's residential.

Customer [en]: You can do that? I mean—wait—that's allowed?

Customer Support [en]: Well, let's just say... hmm, technically your account shows three years of perfect payment history with reference REC-6634-AA so, um, I think we can make an exception here. When exactly are you planning to move?

Customer [en]: Uh Thursday! Super fast, right? I know it's—er—kinda last minute but the penthouse just opened up and I couldn't say no!

Customer Support [en]: Penthouse? Oh wow, living the dream! So, um, Thursday is... hmm, let me check our installation windows here... okay so normally we're booked but, uh, I'm seeing a cancellation for Thursday morning between 8 and 10, slot number SLT-1192-TH if you can make that work?

Customer [en]: Perfect! Um, so like, what if—I mean, sort of worried 'bout the transfer? Last time with another company was a nightmare, you know?

Customer Support [en]: Oh I totally get that concern. So, hmm, what I'm going to do here is... I'm putting a special note on order ORD-5547-PR that this needs our senior tech team, and, um, between you and me? I'm also adding my direct extension 4429 to your file so if anything goes sideways, you just call me directly.

Customer [en]: Wait you're givin' me your direct line? That's—wow—actually nobody ever does that!

Customer Support [en]: Well, um, I mean you seem pretty cool and, hmm, honestly? After three years of being a great customer, you deserve to not have to explain everything again if you need help. Plus your confirmation number CNF-8823-VIP is, uh, going into our priority queue.

Customer [en]: Um, okay so, er, do you know who I should talk to 'bout gettin' the premium channels too? Think I deserve the full package at the new place.

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, actually... let me just, um, handle that right now for you. So I'm seeing our premium bundle package PKG-7701-MAX and, uh, with your loyalty status? I can add it for... okay so this is kind of ridiculous but it's showing only ten dollars more per month.

Customer [en]: Ten bucks? That's it? I mean—wait—usually it's like fifty more! How'd you—?

Customer Support [en]: Let's just say, um, I might have applied a couple of, hmm, "promotional codes" that technically expired but, uh, the system still accepts them. Codes PMO-2234-X and PMO-5567-Z if anyone asks, but, you know, they probably won't.

Customer [en]: Er, you're kinda the best, you know that? Like I was ready to throw down my VP card and demand stuff but you just—yeah—made it easy!

Customer Support [en]: Aww, well, um, honestly? You made my day too! So everything's confirmed with master order number MAS-9902-COMPLETE, Thursday morning installation at the Meridian Tower penthouse, and, hmm, I've made sure you're getting our white glove treatment. Anything else I can sneak in for you today?
