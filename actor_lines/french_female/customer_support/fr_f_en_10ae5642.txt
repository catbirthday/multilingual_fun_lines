Scenario: spice merchant, confused about international shipping surcharges that weren't disclosed

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I just... I can't understand these charges. Two hundred dollars extra.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you for calling. Um, let me just... pull up your account here. Could I get your, uh, order number or... if you have that handy?

Customer [en]: It's... somewhere here. I just... everything's a mess.

Customer Support [en]: That's okay. Take your time. Um, we can also look it up by, uh, your business name or email if that's... I mean, whatever's easier for you right now.

Customer [en]: Global Spice Trading. The order to Germany last week.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. Let me just... okay so I'm seeing, um, order number ORD-4429-SP91 here. Shipped November 15th. And, uh, you're asking about the... hmm, these additional charges that came through?

Customer [en]: Nobody told me. Nobody said there'd be... I planned everything and now...

Customer Support [en]: Right. So, um, I can see what happened here. The thing is—um, let me just—okay so your shipment crossed through, uh, multiple customs zones. Transaction ID TXN-88542-CU shows... hmm, how do I explain this...

Customer [en]: Multiple zones? But it's just—it goes from here to Germany, that's...

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, it's actually... complicated. Your package went through, uh, through Newark first. Then London. Then, um, finally to Frankfurt. Each transfer point has its own... well, its own fee structure.

Customer [en]: This is. Absolutely. Unacceptable.

Customer Support [en]: I completely understand your frustration. Um, looking at your account... reference number REF-2298-XK... these surcharges should have been, uh, disclosed during checkout. Let me see if... hmm, if something went wrong there.

Customer [en]: Should have been disclosed. Yes. Precisely. They weren't.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I'm checking the system and, uh, there's a note here. Invoice INV-66019-B. It looks like... hmm, these fees were added after, um, after your shipment was already processed because of... weight recalculation?

Customer [en]: Weight recalculation. For spices. Sealed containers.

Customer Support [en]: I know. It doesn't... okay so, um, here's what I can do. I'm going to, uh, escalate this to our billing team. Case number CSE-90124-RT. And, um, we'll review whether these charges were... properly communicated.

Customer [en]: I need this fixed. My margins are already... I can't absorb this.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. Yes. Um, so let me just... I'm adding priority status. Code PRI-445. And, uh, between you and me? These international fees have been, um, causing issues for other merchants too. We're actually... reviewing the whole process.

Customer [en]: How long until someone contacts me about this?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, with the priority code? Within 24 hours. Definitely. Uh, they'll call the number on file... ends in 7829? And they'll have, um, full authority to adjust these charges. Is that... will that work?
