=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Please, help me.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Oh my God, um, Riley? I mean, is that really you standing here with, well, your face all swollen like that after, er, five years of nothing?

Character 1 [en]: Look, I know we haven't, [strained], talked since I dropped out and you went to, [bitter], medical school, but right now my throat is, [panicked], closing up and I can't breathe properly.

Character 2 [en]: [professional] Okay, um, sit down immediately and, [focused], tell me what you've been exposed to in the last, [urgent], hour—did you eat something, er, get stung, or touch anything unusual?

Character 1 [en]: [wheezing] The new tattoo ink at the shop had something, [gasping], different in it and now everything's burning. [coughs]

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, stay still.

Character 1 [en]: You know, I wouldn't have come here if, [embarrassed], I had literally any other option, um, but the emergency room would mean, well, bankruptcy.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] I'm getting the epinephrine now, and um, for what it's worth, I'm, [conflicted], glad you came here even if it's just because you're, [sad], desperate, because at least I know you're, well, still alive. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Don't make this into some kind of, [uncomfortable], reconciliation moment while I'm literally dying here, okay?

Character 2 [en]: [administering shot] This might sting a bit but you'll, [reassuring], feel better in about thirty seconds, and then we need to, [careful], monitor you for the next hour. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [breathing easier] God, um, I forgot how you always, [grudging], knew exactly what to do in a crisis, even when we were kids and I'd, [nostalgic], get into trouble, you'd somehow, well, fix everything.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, not everything.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Mom's death.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Yeah, well, that's why I went into public health, um, trying to prevent what we couldn't, [voice breaking], prevent for her, while you, er, went the opposite direction.

Character 1 [en]: Music was the only thing that made, [raw], sense after she died.

Character 2 [en]: [tentative] I actually, um, downloaded your band's EP last month, and well, that song about hospital waiting rooms made me, [emotional], cry in my office. [laughs softly]

Character 1 [en]: You know, I wrote that one thinking about all those nights we, [vulnerable], spent there with her, um, pretending everything would be okay.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Well, maybe after you're stable, um, we could grab coffee and actually, [nervous], talk instead of just existing in the same city pretending the other doesn't exist?

Character 1 [en]: [considering] Your medical knowledge just saved my, [reluctant], life, so I guess I owe you at least one conversation about, [lighter], something other than dying. [half-laughs]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Look, um, the swelling's going down already, and well, your color's coming back, which means you're, [professional], responding well to the treatment, but also means you're, [personal], going to be okay, and er, maybe we can be too. [sighs deeply]
