=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [tense] The mother's testimony is scheduled for, [checking notes], next Tuesday which means we need to move the child, [urgent], before the syndicate realizes there's leverage they haven't considered yet.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I understand the urgency but this five-year-old has already been through, [protective], three foster homes in the past year, and I mean, another sudden relocation could cause irreversible psychological damage, you know. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] She's in danger.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Every child in my care deserves stability and you're asking me to, [struggling], uproot her entire world based on threats that may never materialize.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Um, look, I've seen what these people do to, [haunted], family members of witnesses and, well, I mean, trust me when I say the foster home trauma is nothing compared to, [breaking], what could happen if we don't move fast.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, you know, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, um, I've never had to, [angry], choose between a child's immediate safety and their, [voice cracking], long-term emotional wellbeing like this, and I mean, there has to be, [desperate], another way to protect her.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] There's something about this case I'm not, [hesitant], authorized to share but if you knew what I, [careful], know, you'd already have her packed.

Character 2 [en]: [suspicious] So, um, you're asking me to traumatize this little girl based on, [bitter], classified information that you can't even, well, verify, while I'm supposed to just, [incredulous], trust your judgment about her life, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] The syndicate has already killed two witnesses this month and they've been, [whispering], asking questions about the mother's family connections at her old, [trembling], neighborhood which means they're getting closer to discovering, [very quiet], Emily exists. [pauses]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] You just used her name which violates every protocol we, [realizing], established about keeping her identity separate from her mother's case, [shaking], and now I understand you're more terrified than you're, [emotional], letting on. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: I've been watching the surveillance footage of men photographing, [grim], her daycare center for the past three days. [exhales heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] Then we move tonight but I'm coming with her through the, [determined], entire relocation process because she trusts me and I won't, [fierce], let her face this alone.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Well, um, thank you.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] I'll need to create a cover story for her current foster family that won't, [thoughtful], raise suspicions but also explains why she's suddenly, [sad], gone without causing them to file missing person reports.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Um, I mean, I've already prepared documentation showing she's being, [careful], transferred to a specialized medical facility for, well, treatment that her current placement can't provide, you know. [sighs softly]

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] Give me two hours to pack her favorite toys and the, [tender], blanket she can't sleep without because maintaining those small, [breaking], comforts might be all that keeps her grounded.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] We'll keep her safe.

Character 2 [en]: I know, um, but safe doesn't always mean, [heavy], undamaged, and well, that's what keeps me up at night, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [honest] When this is over and her mother's testimony puts these monsters away, [hopeful], Emily will have a chance at a real life with adoptive parents who'll never have to, [emotional], look over their shoulders, and maybe that future is worth, [quiet], this temporary hell.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Well, I mean, I'll hold you to that promise because, um, if we're wrong about this and she ends up, [fearful], more broken than before, I'll never forgive either, [bitter], of us for what we're about to, [trailing off], do, you know.
