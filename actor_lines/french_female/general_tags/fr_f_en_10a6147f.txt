=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] So you're the one who's been, um, [furious], teaching my daughter how to, well, [barely controlled], kill people behind my back for the past, I mean, six months.

Character 2 [en]: Teaching her to, uh, [steady], survive is more accurate, and she came to me, you know, [matter-of-fact], begging for lessons after those kids at school put her in the hospital, I mean, twice.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Well, um, what?

Character 2 [en]: [calm] She never told you about the bullying, um, [resigned], did she, or about how the school, well, [bitter], basically told her to just avoid them like that's even possible, you know. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: She said she fell during, [disbelieving], gym class and the other time was just, [voice breaking], a stupid accident with her locker door.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Look, um, your kid's got real talent and, I mean, [impressed], more importantly she's got the discipline to use it responsibly which is, well, [thoughtful], rare in someone so young, you know, especially after what she's been through.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] But she's only sixteen and, um, [pleading], you're filling her head with ideas about joining some private military company, I mean, like it's a normal career path.

Character 2 [en]: It pays better than, well, [pragmatic], most college degrees will ever get her, and umm, [frank], she'll learn skills that actually matter in the real world, not just, you know, [dismissive], theories from textbooks written by people who've never left their ivory towers.

Character 1 [en]: Skills that matter like, um, [sarcastic], what exactly—how to overthrow governments or, well, guard oil pipelines for corporations?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Skills like situational awareness that, [firm], keeps you from becoming a victim, medical training that can, [passionate], save lives anywhere, and the confidence to, [proud], stand up for herself instead of hiding bruises under makeup.

Character 1 [en]: [breaking] Um, I just, well, wanted better for her.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] Better doesn't always mean, um, [understanding], safer, and she knows that now because, well, [sympathetic], she's seen what happens when you can't protect yourself or, you know, the people you care about.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Every night I check on her and see, [tearful], those scars she thinks I don't know about.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Then you should understand why she needs, [earnest], this training more than she needs your protection because, [direct], protection without preparation just makes her dependent on others.

Character 1 [en]: You turned my baby girl into someone who, [anguished], dreams about combat zones instead of, [bitter], college dorms and first dates and all the, [voice cracking], normal things teenagers should want.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] She already lost those dreams when three kids, [grave], cornered her in that bathroom and showed her what, [hard], the world really is when nobody's coming to save you.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] God, I mean, I didn't know it was, um, [horrified], that bad—she never said anything about, well, [guilty], being cornered or how many there were, you know. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] She's not running toward danger, um, [patient], she's learning to face it on her own terms, and I mean, [respectful], that takes more courage than either of us can, well, [honest], probably imagine at our age. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: If she goes through with this, [hollow], if she enlists when she turns eighteen, [broken], will you at least promise to keep training her until then?

Character 2 [en]: [solemn] I'll make sure she's more prepared than, [committed], I ever was at her age, and that's, [sincere], a promise I don't make lightly.
