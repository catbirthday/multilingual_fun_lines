=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [tense] Look, I know this is, [uncomfortable], irregular but my own monitoring device started, [panicked], beeping during my shift and I need someone who can, [desperate], examine it without reporting to my department.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Well, um, that's definitely not, [suspicious], something I hear every day—I mean, an officer wearing their own product, so, [cautious], let me take a look at this thing. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I don't know, um, how this happened but, [breaking], three months ago I was told it was, you know, [shaking], deactivated after my own probation ended—I mean, they promised me.

Character 2 [en]: [focused] This model was, er, discontinued five years ago because, well, [grim], it kept transmitting even after court orders expired—umm, basically creating permanent surveillance.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] So I've been tracking criminals while being, [hollow], tracked myself like some kind of sick cosmic joke.

Character 2 [en]: [discovering] Wait, um, there's something else—this device is, [shocked], broadcasting to two separate frequencies, and, well, one of them isn't, you know, [worried], even registered to law enforcement. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] You're telling me that someone outside the, [frightened], department has been monitoring every move I make, every, [voice cracking], house I visit for work, every, [trembling], location of every person I supervise?

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] I mean, yeah, and, um, whoever's receiving this data has, [disturbed], access to your entire network—er, basically every monitored individual in your, well, caseload.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Can you trace, um, where the signal's going because, [frantic], I need to know who's been, you know, [breaking], watching me watch them—I mean, this is insane.

Character 2 [en]: [working] The coordinates are pointing to, umm, an abandoned warehouse on, [confused], Pier 47 but, well, that's where they used to, [remembering], store decommissioned monitoring equipment before the, you know, budget cuts. [whispers]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] I've sent dozens of people there for, [angry], community service thinking it was just, [disgusted], cleaning up old tech, but now I'm wondering what they were, [horrified], actually doing with all that access. [groans]

Character 2 [en]: Someone's been, um, building a parallel surveillance network using, [revelation], officers like you as unwitting nodes—I mean, [technical], this code here shows automated collection protocols that, well, [amazed], harvest everything.

Character 1 [en]: Every address I've verified, um, every, [sickened], violation I've reported, every person I've sent back to, you know, [defeated], prison—they have it all, don't they? [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [grim] Based on what I'm seeing here, um, they don't just, [careful], have your data—they've been using it to, well, [measured], predict probation violations before they happen, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Um, well, shit.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Look, I can disable this thing but, um, whoever's watching will, [warning], know immediately that we've discovered their, [steady], operation—so, err, we need to decide right now if you're ready for whatever comes, well, next.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] Well, um, I've spent three years believing I was, [cynical], keeping people accountable when really, you know, I was just another rat in someone's maze.

Character 2 [en]: The signal just spiked which means they're, [alarmed], actively monitoring us right now, probably, [frantic], wondering why you're at a repair shop instead of, [urgent], making your scheduled rounds.

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Let them wonder because I'm done being their, [fierce], puppet—cut the signal and let's see who comes, [determined], crawling out of that warehouse to find out why their, [vengeful], pet officer went dark. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: Alright, um, on three then—just, well, know that once I cut this, [grave], there's no going back to your old life.
