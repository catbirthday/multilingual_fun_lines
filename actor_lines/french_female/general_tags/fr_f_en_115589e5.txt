=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [startled] Well, um, I didn't expect to find anyone, [cautious], in this abandoned place at three in the morning, especially not someone, [confused], painting fake windows on, [amused], broken walls.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I mean, you're not exactly supposed to be here either, um, with your lockpicks and, [nervous], whatever else you're carrying in that bag that's, well, [accusatory], probably stolen from someone.

Character 1 [en]: [intrigued] So, uh, you come here to what—build, I mean, pretend worlds in a place that's, [gesturing], already dead while the rest of the city sleeps, [thoughtful], unaware? [chuckles darkly]

Character 2 [en]: [retreating] These sets aren't pretend—they're, [passionate], more real than anything out there because they tell, [quieter], stories that actually matter instead of just, [bitter], taking from people. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [harsh] Um, that's rich coming from someone who's, well, technically trespassing just like me—we're both, [ironic], criminals here tonight, sweetheart.

Character 2 [en]: [hurt] Well, I create things, um, beautiful things that might, [trembling], inspire someone someday, while you just, er, [disgusted], tear through people's lives and take what isn't, [angry], yours to take.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] You paint sunlight on walls that will, [wistful], never see the sun, build doorways that, [wondering], lead nowhere, craft entire worlds in shadows—maybe we're not, [contemplative], so different after all. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Um, don't try to romanticize what you do by, well, [skeptical], comparing it to art—you destroy while I, er, [firm], desperately try to create something meaningful.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, maybe destruction and creation are just, [philosophical], two sides of the same desperate need to, I mean, [vulnerable], matter in a world that doesn't, [bitter], care about either of us.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] Sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever, [sad], see what I've made here. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] I'm seeing it now, and it's, [appreciative], hauntingly beautiful—like finding flowers growing through concrete cracks. [sighs softly]

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, the owner died three years ago and, [melancholic], his family just forgot this place exists, so I've been, well, [confessing], turning it into something that honors what theater used to, [nostalgic], mean.

Character 1 [en]: [understanding] That's why you risk coming here every night—building, [admiring], memorials to forgotten dreams.

Character 2 [en]: And you risk everything to, [curious], take things—what are you really looking for out there? [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] Um, I guess I'm looking for proof that, well, [searching], something matters enough to protect, to, [broken], keep safe from people like me.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Well, then stop taking things and, um, maybe try, [hopeful], creating something worth protecting instead, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [contemplating] Your painted sunset on that backdrop is catching, [mesmerized], real moonlight through the broken roof—it's making something, [awestruck], impossible happen, something that shouldn't exist but, [moved], somehow does. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [proud] Every impossible thing starts with someone, [passionate], deciding to try anyway, with choosing to build rather than, [pointed], break, to leave something behind that might, [wistful], outlast us.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, um, maybe you're right about choosing what we, [uncertain], leave behind—maybe I've been, well, [regretful], running from the wrong things and toward the, [realizing], wrong endings.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, stay then. [hopeful]
