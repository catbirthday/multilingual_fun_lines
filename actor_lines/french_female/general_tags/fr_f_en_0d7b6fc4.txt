=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] I know I've been gone for, [shaky voice], three years serving the lord's estate but I'm, [desperate], here now and ready to be part of, [quieter], Elara's life again.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] She doesn't even remember you, [cold], not really, just the stories I've told her about the, [bitter], parent who chose duty over, [trailing off], being here when she took her first steps. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, I mean, I didn't choose anything—the summons wasn't, [frustrated], something I could refuse, you know that better than anyone.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] There's always a choice even when, [softer], it feels like there isn't one to make at all.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Look, I, umm, I know you're angry and, well, you have every right to be but I'm, [breaking], trying to make this work somehow, er, for her sake.

Character 2 [en]: [careful] Making it work means, [patient], showing up every single day not just when your, [firm], lord releases you from service to play at being, [sharp], a parent for a few months. [exhales slowly]

Character 1 [en]: [hurt] That's not fair because you knew what, [desperate], my obligations were when we first had her together.

Character 2 [en]: [scattered] Um, knowing something and, well, living through it alone while she, [trembling], cries for someone who isn't there are, umm, completely different experiences that I can't, [hollow], just forget. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [earnest] I sent money every month and, [guilty], wrote letters even though I knew she couldn't, [quieter], read them yet but I wanted her to have them.

Character 2 [en]: [weary] Money doesn't answer the questions about why, [pained], daddy lives in a castle while she lives here wondering if, [breaking], she did something wrong. [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Please just let me try to, [determined], fix this because I can't change the past but, [hopeful], I can be here now if you'll let me.

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] Well, um, she needs stability not someone who might, [worried], disappear again when the next summons arrives, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [resolute] My service ends next month and I've already, [emotional], told them I won't be returning because being her parent matters, [firm], more than any title or position they could, [quieter], ever offer me now.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You're giving up your, umm, knighthood for this, I mean, for her, [stunned], after working toward it your whole life?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Um, well, I realized that, er, all those oaths about protecting the innocent mean, [tender], nothing if I can't protect my own daughter from, you know, growing up without me.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] She likes strawberries.

Character 1 [en]: Just like her mother.

Character 2 [en]: She has your stubbornness though—won't, um, give up on anything once she sets her, [gentle], mind to it, like, even impossible puzzles that frustrate her to tears.

Character 1 [en]: I want to know everything about her that I've, [regretful], missed and I know it will take time to earn both, [determined], your trust and hers but I'm not going, [firm], anywhere this time. [voice steady]

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] Tomorrow morning then, she wakes at sunrise and, [warmer], always wants someone to watch the birds with her.
