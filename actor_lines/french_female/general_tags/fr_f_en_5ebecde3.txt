=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, I haven't been near anything, [terrified], resembling a tank of water since, well, I nearly drowned at fourteen, so, uh, this is incredibly difficult.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] The hyperbaric chamber isn't filled with water at all—it's, [reassuring], pressurized oxygen that feels like sitting in an airplane, [calm], nothing more than that. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Um, well, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Your surgeon said if we don't start treatment within, [serious], forty-eight hours, they'll need to schedule the amputation for, [heavy], next Tuesday morning.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] I mean, I've been taking care of this, [frustrated], damn foot for three years with bandages and, um, antibiotics and now they're telling me I could, [voice breaking], lose it because I'm too, well, scared to get in that, [shaking], metal coffin.

Character 2 [en]: [understanding] Listen, I've treated over two thousand patients in, [thoughtful], twenty years and every single one who was claustrophobic made it, [confident], through just fine.

Character 1 [en]: My wife keeps saying I'm being, [bitter], stubborn but she doesn't understand what drowning feels like.

Character 2 [en]: [careful] Well, um, the thing is, I actually, [vulnerable], do understand because I almost drowned during, uh, dive training and that's why I, [earnest], specialized in helping people through their fears. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You almost drowned but still work with, [incredulous], pressure chambers every single day?

Character 2 [en]: Um, yeah, because facing it, [determined], every day took away its power over me and, well, now I help others, [passionate], do the same thing, I mean, reclaim their lives from fear.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] That sounds like something from a self-help book my daughter keeps, [dismissive], pushing on me about embracing discomfort or, [sarcastic], whatever nonsense they're selling these days.

Character 2 [en]: Your daughter loves you enough to, [firm], research treatment options and drive you here at six in the morning.

Character 1 [en]: [softening] She's been sleeping in that uncomfortable chair outside for, [guilty], three nights straight. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] She's terrified too.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] If I do this, I need you to, [anxious], promise me that you'll get me out immediately if I, [pleading], can't breathe properly.

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] I have an intercom system, emergency release protocols, and I'll be, [reassuring], monitoring your vitals the entire time from right outside the, [gentle], window where you can see me constantly. [nods]

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] My grandkids have a soccer tournament next month and they're, [emotional], counting on me to be there cheering from the, [voice cracking], sidelines like always.

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] Then let's make sure you're there with, [warm], both feet firmly planted on that field.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I suppose if I survived, [resigned], Vietnam, two heart attacks, and, um, forty years of my wife's cooking, I can, [gathering courage], survive an hour in your, er, fancy oxygen tank.

Character 2 [en]: [smiling] Um, that's the spirit—and hey, I mean, my chamber has, [playful], better reviews than most restaurants in town, so, well, you're in good hands. [chuckles]
