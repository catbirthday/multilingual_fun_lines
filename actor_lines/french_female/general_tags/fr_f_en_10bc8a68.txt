=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] I need to, um, sell this and I know it's not, [ashamed], worth much but, well, it's all I have left from my service days. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Wait, this is, um, a Silver Star with, [recognizing], a specific battalion number that I, well, I've seen before.

Character 1 [en]: It was for pulling three guys out of a, [distant], burning Humvee outside Kandahar when an IED, [hollow], hit our convoy back in 2011. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] My brother was, um, one of those three soldiers and he, [voice breaking], still talks about the sergeant who went back into the flames even after his, [overwhelmed], own uniform caught fire, I mean, that was you.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Your brother was, uh, Private Martinez with the, [searching memory], crooked smile who kept photos of his kids taped inside his helmet, well, I always wondered if he made it home okay.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] He did. [crying]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] That's good to hear because some nights I still, [haunted], wake up smelling that burning metal and wondering if saving them was worth what it cost me afterwards.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Listen, um, I can't let you sell this medal when you, [choked up], saved the only family I have left, but I mean, I understand you need money so let me, [determined], help you another way.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I don't need charity, um, I just need enough for, [embarrassed], a room tonight because the shelter's full and it's supposed to drop below freezing again, you know.

Character 2 [en]: Well, my brother owns, um, a construction company and he's been, [hopeful], looking for someone who understands discipline and hard work, and I mean, [careful], he never forgot the man who saved his life.

Character 1 [en]: I haven't had a real job in, uh, three years since the PTSD got bad and, well, [defeated], most places won't even look at someone with my history anymore. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [firm] He'll hire you today if you're willing because, um, he believes in, [passionate], second chances for people who've sacrificed everything, and well, there's an apartment above his office that's been empty for months. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] I can't.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] You went back into hell itself to save strangers, so um, maybe it's time you let, [gentle], someone return the favor by pulling you out of yours, I mean, that's what my brother would want.

Character 1 [en]: After everything that's happened, I forgot what it, [voice cracking], feels like when someone sees you as more than just another homeless vet. [tears]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] You're not just another anything.

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] When I came in here, um, I was ready to trade my last piece of pride for twenty dollars, but well, [grateful], somehow I'm walking out with something I thought I'd lost forever.

Character 2 [en]: [earnest] My brother says that medal represents the best, [proud], moment of his worst day, and meeting you represents the best, [hopeful], moment of mine.

Character 1 [en]: I guess, um, sometimes life gives you these unexpected moments of grace when you're at, [wondering], rock bottom and least expecting them.

Character 2 [en]: [certain] This isn't grace or luck, it's just, [steady], people taking care of each other the way we're supposed to. [smiles]
