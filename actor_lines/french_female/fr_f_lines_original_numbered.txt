# Speaker Lines Only (Original English) - French (Female)
============================================================

1. Hmm, let me see here... okay so between you and me? Moving service is actually one of my favorite things to help with because, um, I can usually sneak in some perks. Let me just pull up your account with reference number ACC-7829-XL94 here.
2. Ohhh nice, the Meridian Tower? Yeah so, um, I'm seeing here that, hmm, we actually have fiber coverage there which means... okay so this is good news, your current plan PLN-4472-B can transfer but I might be able to, uh, upgrade you to our premium tier for the same price.
3. Morrison Tech! Okay so, hmm, let me just... yeah we definitely want to make sure you're set up properly then. Your new address confirmation is ADR-9021-MT55 and, um, I'm actually going to flag this as a priority business transfer even though it's residential.
4. Well, let's just say... hmm, technically your account shows three years of perfect payment history with reference REC-6634-AA so, um, I think we can make an exception here. When exactly are you planning to move?
5. Penthouse? Oh wow, living the dream! So, um, Thursday is... hmm, let me check our installation windows here... okay so normally we're booked but, uh, I'm seeing a cancellation for Thursday morning between 8 and 10, slot number SLT-1192-TH if you can make that work?
6. Oh I totally get that concern. So, hmm, what I'm going to do here is... I'm putting a special note on order ORD-5547-PR that this needs our senior tech team, and, um, between you and me? I'm also adding my direct extension 4429 to your file so if anything goes sideways, you just call me directly.
7. Well, um, I mean you seem pretty cool and, hmm, honestly? After three years of being a great customer, you deserve to not have to explain everything again if you need help. Plus your confirmation number CNF-8823-VIP is, uh, going into our priority queue.
8. Hmm, actually... let me just, um, handle that right now for you. So I'm seeing our premium bundle package PKG-7701-MAX and, uh, with your loyalty status? I can add it for... okay so this is kind of ridiculous but it's showing only ten dollars more per month.
9. Let's just say, um, I might have applied a couple of, hmm, "promotional codes" that technically expired but, uh, the system still accepts them. Codes PMO-2234-X and PMO-5567-Z if anyone asks, but, you know, they probably won't.
10. Aww, well, um, honestly? You made my day too! So everything's confirmed with master order number MAS-9902-COMPLETE, Thursday morning installation at the Meridian Tower penthouse, and, hmm, I've made sure you're getting our white glove treatment. Anything else I can sneak in for you today?
11. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, I want to make sure I'm seeing everything correctly. Can I get your, um, what's the... your order confirmation number?
12. ORD-482, okay, um, and just to double-check, that's O-R-D dash four eight two? I'm seeing here that, uh, hmm, actually I need the full number with all the, um, all the characters after that?
13. Perfect, so, um, I've got ORD-4827-MP here and, uh, let me see... okay so that one's, hmm, showing as already processed but not shipped yet, which is actually, um, good news for what you're trying to do.
14. Okay okay, so, ummm, let me just, uh, make sure I've got all three... ORD-4827-MP, then, um, ORD-4829-LC, and, er, ORD-4831-PR. Is that, hmm, is that everything you wanted to combine?
15. Oh wow, yeah, so, um, sixty dollars is definitely, uh, that's a lot. Let me see here... hmm, okay so the system's showing me that, um, two of these are in our main warehouse—that's the MP and LC ones—but, uh, the PR order is coming from our, er, our satellite facility.
16. No no, wait, um, I think I can actually, uh, let me try something here... sometimes if I put in a, hmm, what's it called... a consolidation request? With the code CSL-MERGE-92, I can, um, I can override the facility difference.
17. Absolutely, so, ummm, I'm putting in the request now and, uh, okay so the system's asking me to... hmm, wait, let me just verify your shipping address real quick? Just to make sure everything, um, everything goes to the right place?
18. Perfect, 447 Elm Street, Austin, 78745. So, um, good news—the consolidation went through with confirmation number CNF-88293-COMB, and, uh, instead of sixty dollars, you're looking at, hmm, just eighteen fifty for combined shipping.
19. So with the combined shipping, um, let me check the, uh, the estimated delivery... okay so all three items under tracking number TRK-293847-UPS should arrive by, hmm, Thursday the 15th. Is that, um, is that going to work for the birthday party?
20. Oh, um, I totally get it, and honestly? Between you and me, the, uh, the consolidation thing isn't something we advertise but, hmm, for birthday parties especially, I always try to make it work. Your receipt number's going to be, um, RCP-77492-B and you should get an email confirmation in about, er, five minutes or so.
21. Oh no, yeah, I know, that system is honestly ridiculous sometimes. Um, let me just pull up your account here, uh, do you have your customer ID or order number handy?
22. No no, totally get it, um, that phone system makes everyone crazy, uh, we actually had a meeting about it last week because, er, so many people complain. Take your time, I can look you up by phone number too.
23. Um, perfect, so I've got you here, customer ID CST-49982-LV, and uh, I can see your recent order, um, ORD-7263-XM92, is that what you were calling about?
24. Yeah, it does that, um, especially with "track" for some reason, uh, it always thinks people are saying "back" or "black" and then, er, sends them to completely wrong departments. So anyway, let me check the tracking on ORD-7263-XM92 here.
25. Um, so, uh, good news is it's definitely on its way, tracking number TRK-8829374-US, but, er, I'm seeing it's running about, hmm, a day behind schedule.
26. No seriously, I'd be frustrated too. Um, the carrier had some weather delays yesterday, uh, but looking at your delivery area code ZIP-94022, it should, er, definitely arrive tomorrow by end of day.
27. Yeah, I'm pulling up the detailed tracking now on TRK-8829374-US and, um, it cleared the distribution center at 4 AM this morning, so, uh, unless something really unusual happens, you're good for tomorrow.
28. Um, honestly? The express shipping, uh, got delayed too with that weather, so, er, you actually saved money for the same result. Your confirmation RCP-7263-A shows standard shipping and, um, that was definitely the right call.
29. So if it's not there by 8 PM tomorrow, um, call back with reference number REF-8827-DELAY and, uh, we'll overnight a replacement at no charge, er, and you'd get that Thursday guaranteed.
30. REF-8827-DELAY, and um, ask for a supervisor directly if you need to call back, uh, just skip that awful automated system entirely, er, honestly we all hate it as much as you do.
31. Oh wow, um, fifth time—that's, uh, that's a lot. I'm gonna—wait, let me pull up your account here—actually, what's your account number or, um, phone number on file?
32. Either one works! I can look you up with—sorry, I mean, um, whatever's easier for you. I know with all the moves it gets, uh... confusing.
33. Perfect, got you right here! Account ACC-7749-MN2. And, um, I can see you've had—oh gosh—yeah, four address changes since January. Military family?
34. Oh, I totally get it. My brother's Air Force, so... yeah, I know, it's ridiculous how often you have to move. Um, so I'm gonna make sure—let me set up something here that'll help. Your new address?
35. So, um, I'm setting you up with our, uh, military family profile code—MIL-PREF-0923—which basically means, um, next time you call? You just give them that code and we can update everything in like... thirty seconds instead of all this.
36. Because honestly? Um, half our reps don't even—sorry, they don't know about it. It's not really, uh... advertised. But I'm making sure you're protected for next time.
37. I know, I know how it sounds. But look, um, I'm putting a note here—NOTE-85542-JK—that says, uh, "frequent military relocations, priority handling required" so even if you don't remember the code, anyone who pulls this up will... you know...
38. Um, yeah, no, I'm—look, moving five times in a year is, uh, it's insane, and our system makes it worse. So I'm updating your address to 4421 Base Road, confirmation CNF-2290-BASE, and, um, adding every single flag I can to make your life easier because... that's just ridiculous what you're dealing with.
39. Then you call, give them code MIL-PREF-0923 or reference, um, today's interaction ID INT-445821, and they'll... sorry, WE'LL get you sorted immediately. Also I'm waiving the, uh, the address change fee that's been charged to you the last four times because that's just...
40. So you've been charged, um, fifteen dollars each time—total of sixty dollars—which is, uh, absolutely getting refunded. Credit ref CRD-9901-RFND will show up in, um, three to five days. Military families shouldn't pay to... to update addresses when you're literally serving the country, that's just...
41. Well, I've been facilitating creative writing therapy groups for, you know, about three years now and it's sort of transformative. People often discover things about themselves they never knew were buried.
42. It can be, but we start gently with simple prompts like describing a safe place or writing letters to their younger selves. The beauty is that metaphor and fiction create this protective distance from raw emotions.
43. When someone writes about a character facing their struggles, they're processing their own experiences without the overwhelming directness of "I" statements. It's like looking at your life through a softer lens while still doing the deep work.
44. That fear is actually really common, er, because writing makes thoughts permanent in a way that talking doesn't, I mean. But you can always burn, shred, or delete what you write - the healing happens in the process, not the product.
45. Hmm, sharing is always optional, honestly, and about half choose to keep their work private, like completely. What matters is the act of translating emotions into words, giving shape to things that felt shapeless.
46. There's no "good" or "bad" in therapeutic writing - it's not about crafting beautiful sentences but about authentic expression. Some of my most breakthrough sessions involved stick figures, single words repeated, or angry scribbles that became words.
47. We might write about doors we're afraid to open, conversations with our fears as characters, or rewrite difficult memories with different endings. Sometimes I'll bring in objects like keys or shells and ask people to write their stories.
48. Start with lists - things that make you angry, moments you felt powerful, colors that match your moods. Lists are writing with training wheels, building confidence before diving into paragraphs.
49. Right so, even writing for five minutes about why you can't write is, basically, still writing, ah? The resistance itself becomes material to explore, which often leads to unexpected breakthroughs.
50. It's just that starting alone lets you build trust with yourself first, mmm, but groups offer this incredible mirror effect where hearing others' struggles makes yours feel less isolating, actually. Both paths lead to healing, just through different doors.
51. Nice to meet you Sarah! I'm Marcus and I [enunciating every word] completely understand that feeling. Introductions are weird because you're trying to sum yourself up in a few sentences when you're obviously so much more complex than that.
52. Well, I usually start with, um, the basics and then, I guess, let the conversation naturally evolve from there, you know? Work stuff, hobbies, random facts about yourself—whatever feels authentic in the moment rather than forcing some rehearsed elevator pitch.
53. Accounting gets such, er, a bad reputation but [very loudly] numbers tell stories, right, I mean they really do! Every spreadsheet is basically a narrative about how a business operates, where money flows, what priorities matter—it's detective work with math.
54. People think it's, like, all calculators and receipts, but actually, you're basically solving puzzles all day, hmm? Finding discrepancies, spotting patterns, making sure everything balances—it requires serious analytical thinking and attention to detail.
55. I'm a [stuttering] f-freelance graphic designer, which m-means I work from home mostly. Some days I'm creating logos for startups, other days it's wedding invitations or restaurant menus—the variety keeps things interesting even when clients are being difficult.
56. It definitely has its perks, though the isolation can be tough sometimes. You end up having full conversations with your cat just to hear another voice, and suddenly realize you haven't left the house in three days.
57. The quiet is, uh, definitely peaceful at first, but then, I guess, it becomes almost too quiet, you know? You start missing those random water cooler conversations or even just hearing other people existing nearby—humans aren't meant to work in complete isolation.
58. Coffee shops are, well, hit or miss—sometimes the background noise is, like, perfect for focus, but honestly, other times it's chaos. You'll be deep in a project when someone starts a loud phone call about their medical problems right next to you.
59. The distractions are, um, definitely real, but [very sincerely] sometimes being around people, even strangers, actually helps with creativity, I mean. There's something about that ambient energy that makes you feel less alone in your work, even if nobody's actually talking to you.
60. You should, but, hmm, pick your spot carefully—some places are, well, more conducive to work than others, right? Look for those quieter neighborhood cafes rather than the busy downtown chains where everyone's basically shouting over the espresso machine.
61. Oh yeah, that's, uh, super common actually—parallelization overhead can, you know, totally kill performance if your workload isn't big enough. Are you using threads or processes, I mean, what's your setup?
62. Python multiprocessing for image processing... that's [joking] brave of you! But seriously, the pickle serialization between processes can be a massive bottleneck, especially if you're passing large image arrays back and forth.
63. Nope nope, so, Python processes can't share memory directly—they're, basically, completely separate. Every time you send data to a worker, hmm, Python has to serialize it, send it over, then deserialize it on the other side.
64. Exactly! For image processing you'd probably want shared memory arrays or maybe just use NumPy with proper vectorization. Sometimes good NumPy code beats naive parallelization by a mile.
65. Vectorization is, um, basically letting NumPy's [quickly] C backend handle your loops instead of Python—like, you operate on entire arrays at once. It's usually way faster than, actually, explicit parallelization for many operations.
66. Then you'd want to, honestly, look into proper frameworks—OpenCV uses, well, optimized C++ under the hood, or maybe, I guess, GPU acceleration with CUDA if you're doing heavy lifting.
67. It's gotten way easier! Libraries like CuPy literally let you write NumPy-style code that runs on the GPU. You don't need to touch raw CUDA unless you're doing something really specialized.
68. Yeah and for your image stuff specifically, there's also things like RAPIDS or even just PyTorch for image operations. They handle all the scary memory transfer optimization behind the scenes.
69. Absolutely! PyTorch is, er, just a tensor library at its core—people use it for, like, all sorts of scientific computing. The GPU acceleration and, basically, automatic differentiation are just bonuses.
70. Starting fresh isn't always bad—sometimes you, honestly, need to pick the right tool first. Parallel computing is [passionately] all about matching your problem to the right abstraction level, and, you know, Python multiprocessing is rarely the answer for number crunching!
71. [measured] She doesn't even remember you, [cold], not really, just the stories I've told her about the, [bitter], parent who chose duty over, [trailing off], being here when she took her first steps. [sighs]
72. [gentle] There's always a choice even when, [softer], it feels like there isn't one to make at all.
73. [careful] Making it work means, [patient], showing up every single day not just when your, [firm], lord releases you from service to play at being, [sharp], a parent for a few months. [exhales slowly]
74. [scattered] Um, knowing something and, well, living through it alone while she, [trembling], cries for someone who isn't there are, umm, completely different experiences that I can't, [hollow], just forget. [long pause]
75. [weary] Money doesn't answer the questions about why, [pained], daddy lives in a castle while she lives here wondering if, [breaking], she did something wrong. [voice cracks]
76. [conflicted] Well, um, she needs stability not someone who might, [worried], disappear again when the next summons arrives, you know?
77. [surprised] You're giving up your, umm, knighthood for this, I mean, for her, [stunned], after working toward it your whole life?
78. [wavering] She likes strawberries.
79. She has your stubbornness though—won't, um, give up on anything once she sets her, [gentle], mind to it, like, even impossible puzzles that frustrate her to tears.
80. [accepting] Tomorrow morning then, she wakes at sunrise and, [warmer], always wants someone to watch the birds with her.
81. Teaching her to, uh, [steady], survive is more accurate, and she came to me, you know, [matter-of-fact], begging for lessons after those kids at school put her in the hospital, I mean, twice.
82. [calm] She never told you about the bullying, um, [resigned], did she, or about how the school, well, [bitter], basically told her to just avoid them like that's even possible, you know. [sighs]
83. [gentle] Look, um, your kid's got real talent and, I mean, [impressed], more importantly she's got the discipline to use it responsibly which is, well, [thoughtful], rare in someone so young, you know, especially after what she's been through.
84. It pays better than, well, [pragmatic], most college degrees will ever get her, and umm, [frank], she'll learn skills that actually matter in the real world, not just, you know, [dismissive], theories from textbooks written by people who've never left their ivory towers.
85. [defensive] Skills like situational awareness that, [firm], keeps you from becoming a victim, medical training that can, [passionate], save lives anywhere, and the confidence to, [proud], stand up for herself instead of hiding bruises under makeup.
86. [softer] Better doesn't always mean, um, [understanding], safer, and she knows that now because, well, [sympathetic], she's seen what happens when you can't protect yourself or, you know, the people you care about.
87. [firm] Then you should understand why she needs, [earnest], this training more than she needs your protection because, [direct], protection without preparation just makes her dependent on others.
88. [quiet] She already lost those dreams when three kids, [grave], cornered her in that bathroom and showed her what, [hard], the world really is when nobody's coming to save you.
89. [measured] She's not running toward danger, um, [patient], she's learning to face it on her own terms, and I mean, [respectful], that takes more courage than either of us can, well, [honest], probably imagine at our age. [pauses]
90. [solemn] I'll make sure she's more prepared than, [committed], I ever was at her age, and that's, [sincere], a promise I don't make lightly.
91. [stunned] Wait, this is, um, a Silver Star with, [recognizing], a specific battalion number that I, well, I've seen before.
92. [trembling] My brother was, um, one of those three soldiers and he, [voice breaking], still talks about the sergeant who went back into the flames even after his, [overwhelmed], own uniform caught fire, I mean, that was you.
93. [emotional] He did. [crying]
94. [desperate] Listen, um, I can't let you sell this medal when you, [choked up], saved the only family I have left, but I mean, I understand you need money so let me, [determined], help you another way.
95. Well, my brother owns, um, a construction company and he's been, [hopeful], looking for someone who understands discipline and hard work, and I mean, [careful], he never forgot the man who saved his life.
96. [firm] He'll hire you today if you're willing because, um, he believes in, [passionate], second chances for people who've sacrificed everything, and well, there's an apartment above his office that's been empty for months. [pause]
97. [soft] You went back into hell itself to save strangers, so um, maybe it's time you let, [gentle], someone return the favor by pulling you out of yours, I mean, that's what my brother would want.
98. [warm] You're not just another anything.
99. [earnest] My brother says that medal represents the best, [proud], moment of his worst day, and meeting you represents the best, [hopeful], moment of mine.
100. [certain] This isn't grace or luck, it's just, [steady], people taking care of each other the way we're supposed to. [smiles]
101. [defensive] I mean, you're not exactly supposed to be here either, um, with your lockpicks and, [nervous], whatever else you're carrying in that bag that's, well, [accusatory], probably stolen from someone.
102. [retreating] These sets aren't pretend—they're, [passionate], more real than anything out there because they tell, [quieter], stories that actually matter instead of just, [bitter], taking from people. [sighs]
103. [hurt] Well, I create things, um, beautiful things that might, [trembling], inspire someone someday, while you just, er, [disgusted], tear through people's lives and take what isn't, [angry], yours to take.
104. [surprised] Um, don't try to romanticize what you do by, well, [skeptical], comparing it to art—you destroy while I, er, [firm], desperately try to create something meaningful.
105. [wavering] Sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever, [sad], see what I've made here. [long pause]
106. You know, um, the owner died three years ago and, [melancholic], his family just forgot this place exists, so I've been, well, [confessing], turning it into something that honors what theater used to, [nostalgic], mean.
107. And you risk everything to, [curious], take things—what are you really looking for out there? [pause]
108. [firm] Well, then stop taking things and, um, maybe try, [hopeful], creating something worth protecting instead, you know?
109. [proud] Every impossible thing starts with someone, [passionate], deciding to try anyway, with choosing to build rather than, [pointed], break, to leave something behind that might, [wistful], outlast us.
110. [quiet] Well, um, stay then. [hopeful]
111. Well, um, I understand the urgency but this five-year-old has already been through, [protective], three foster homes in the past year, and I mean, another sudden relocation could cause irreversible psychological damage, you know. [sighs]
112. [frustrated] Every child in my care deserves stability and you're asking me to, [struggling], uproot her entire world based on threats that may never materialize.
113. [defensive] Well, you know, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, um, I've never had to, [angry], choose between a child's immediate safety and their, [voice cracking], long-term emotional wellbeing like this, and I mean, there has to be, [desperate], another way to protect her.
114. [suspicious] So, um, you're asking me to traumatize this little girl based on, [bitter], classified information that you can't even, well, verify, while I'm supposed to just, [incredulous], trust your judgment about her life, you know?
115. [stunned] You just used her name which violates every protocol we, [realizing], established about keeping her identity separate from her mother's case, [shaking], and now I understand you're more terrified than you're, [emotional], letting on. [long pause]
116. [resolute] Then we move tonight but I'm coming with her through the, [determined], entire relocation process because she trusts me and I won't, [fierce], let her face this alone.
117. [quiet] I'll need to create a cover story for her current foster family that won't, [thoughtful], raise suspicions but also explains why she's suddenly, [sad], gone without causing them to file missing person reports.
118. [accepting] Give me two hours to pack her favorite toys and the, [tender], blanket she can't sleep without because maintaining those small, [breaking], comforts might be all that keeps her grounded.
119. I know, um, but safe doesn't always mean, [heavy], undamaged, and well, that's what keeps me up at night, you know.
120. [resigned] Well, I mean, I'll hold you to that promise because, um, if we're wrong about this and she ends up, [fearful], more broken than before, I'll never forgive either, [bitter], of us for what we're about to, [trailing off], do, you know.
121. [shocked] Oh my God, um, Riley? I mean, is that really you standing here with, well, your face all swollen like that after, er, five years of nothing?
122. [professional] Okay, um, sit down immediately and, [focused], tell me what you've been exposed to in the last, [urgent], hour—did you eat something, er, get stung, or touch anything unusual?
123. Um, well, stay still.
124. [gentle] I'm getting the epinephrine now, and um, for what it's worth, I'm, [conflicted], glad you came here even if it's just because you're, [sad], desperate, because at least I know you're, well, still alive. [sighs]
125. [administering shot] This might sting a bit but you'll, [reassuring], feel better in about thirty seconds, and then we need to, [careful], monitor you for the next hour. [pauses]
126. Well, um, not everything.
127. [soft] Yeah, well, that's why I went into public health, um, trying to prevent what we couldn't, [voice breaking], prevent for her, while you, er, went the opposite direction.
128. [tentative] I actually, um, downloaded your band's EP last month, and well, that song about hospital waiting rooms made me, [emotional], cry in my office. [laughs softly]
129. [hopeful] Well, maybe after you're stable, um, we could grab coffee and actually, [nervous], talk instead of just existing in the same city pretending the other doesn't exist?
130. [relieved] Look, um, the swelling's going down already, and well, your color's coming back, which means you're, [professional], responding well to the treatment, but also means you're, [personal], going to be okay, and er, maybe we can be too. [sighs deeply]
131. Hi there! Um, I can definitely help with that. So, uh, just need to pull up your account here—what's your employee ID number? I think we can, um, track that down pretty quickly.
132. Got it, um, 474-829... okay so I'm seeing here, hmm, your last reimbursement request RMB-9042-TK was, uh, processed on the 15th. Should've arrived by now, I think.
133. Oh! Um, I totally understand that frustration. Let me just, uh, check the payment status here... REF-9042-TK shows, hmm, mailed on the 17th to your address on file.
134. Right right.
135. So, um, I can definitely start that process. The thing is, uh, for check CHK-8827-MN over fifty dollars, I need to, hmm, verify it wasn't cashed first. Takes maybe, um, two business days?
136. I know, I know. Um, actually, let me see if... hmm, there might be another option here. Can I, uh, put you on a brief hold? Maybe thirty seconds?
137. Absolutely.
138. No no! So, um, good news actually. I found, uh, an expedite code EXP-2847 that I can apply. We can, hmm, cancel the original and, um, issue direct deposit instead? Should hit by, uh, tomorrow morning.
139. Yep! Um, I just need to, uh, confirm your direct deposit info. Last four of your account on file is, hmm, 7829?
140. Oh absolutely, I, um, completely agree. You guys work so hard and, uh, this shouldn't happen. So I've noted everything under case CSE-4492-BN and, hmm, added a priority flag. Should be all set by tomorrow!
141. Oh I see—let me just—actually wait, um, can I get your account number first? I'm pulling up the, uh, the payment system here and I need to—hmm, yeah I need that to look up your specific transaction details.
142. Absolutely, so um, once you give me that account number I can see everything—the payment status, timing, all of it—but I should mention that, uh, there have been some delays in our system today, so I'm hoping yours isn't affected but let me—let me check for you.
143. Got it got it, so I'm looking at account ACC-4439-P and, um, I can see you've got a pending payment here for—oh this is substantial—it's showing as, uh, initiated yesterday but hmm... let me just... okay so unfortunately it's in what we call a review status which means—and I really wish I had better news here—it's not going to clear until tomorrow at the earliest.
144. I know I know, and believe me if I could just, um, push a button and make it happen instantly I would—but these review holds are, uh, they're automated based on the amount and I don't have—hmm, actually wait, let me check something else here, sometimes there's a workaround...
145. Right so, um, I'm seeing here that your transaction TXN-882947-VN is flagged because it's over our daily threshold—but here's what I can do—I mean, it's not ideal but—I can split this into two smaller payments that would, uh, they'd process immediately, like within the hour, but you'd have to call your venue and explain the two separate transfers.
146. Yes but—and I hate that there's a but here—um, there's a processing fee for expedited transfers, it's gonna be, uh, let me calculate... okay so it's $47.50 per transaction, so you're looking at ninety-five dollars total in fees and I know that's not—I mean, I wish I could waive them but the system won't let me.
147. Um, alright so I'm—wait actually I need to—let me get verbal confirmation here, you're authorizing two expedited transfers of, uh, $4,250 each with confirmation codes EXP-7739-A and EXP-7739-B, total fees ninety-five dollars?
148. So once I submit these—which I'm doing right now actually—you'll get, um, you'll get email confirmations within five minutes, and then the funds hit their account within, uh, typically forty-five minutes but absolutely within the hour, and honestly I'm really glad we found a solution here because I know how stressful this situation is.
149. Definitely definitely, and actually give them these reference numbers—so that's REF-559048-RUSH1 and REF-559048-RUSH2—because, um, their bank can track them immediately even before the funds fully clear, which sometimes helps with, uh, you know, buying you some goodwill while they wait.
150. It's done, I just hit submit so, um, check your email in about three minutes for those confirmations—and honestly, uh, good luck with your events this weekend, I hope they go well after all this stress today, I really do.
151. Okay, um, I can hear you're frustrated and, uh, let me just... what's the word... validate that first. Can you give me your order number so I can, um, pull everything up and we'll get this sorted?
152. Got it, so, um, I'm seeing here it's actually, uh, order number OLM-4492-BK7, and hmm, let me just look at the specs you ordered versus what... oh. Oh dear.
153. So, ummm, I can see the measurements are, uh, completely off from what you submitted, like the depth shows 18 inches but you ordered, um, 24 inches, and the height is... this isn't right at all.
154. Listen, um, I know this feels impossible right now but, uh, we're gonna fix this, okay? Let me just, hmm, check our expedited options under your account ACC-7829-ML...
155. I'm pulling up our emergency fulfillment system, code EFS-90124, and, um, I'm gonna make sure you're taken care of here, like a complete priority override...
156. So, uh, it's not something we advertise but, um, for situations like this where it's clearly our error, I can, hmm, activate protocol PRX-5001 which basically means...
157. I'm gonna personally oversee this fix, okay? Your new reference is REF-8956-XP2, and um, I need you to know that I'm not letting this fail again...
158. Ummm, so here's what I've done—I've tagged this as critical under ticket TKT-30459, and uh, I've got our local warehouse checking stock right now for immediate, um, same-day delivery actually.
159. The warehouse just confirmed under verification VRF-1128 that, um, they have your exact specs in stock, and I'm, uh, making sure the driver double-checks every single measurement before they leave.
160. Um, so your delivery window is 2 to 4 PM today under tracking TRK-6673-QM9, and listen, I'm giving you my direct extension—dial 4429—because, uh, I want you to call me if there's even the slightest issue, we're not... this won't happen again.
161. Okay I can definitely help you with that today, let me just pull up your policy number real quick—do you have that handy or should I look it up by your name?
162. [exhales] That's perfectly fine, um, let me just... what's the word... cross-reference your account here. So I'll need your full name and, uh, the zip code on the policy, and then I can pull up everything including your policy number PLC-449821-V7.
163. Alright so, um, I've got your account here David and, uh, I can see the premium increase that went into effect and... hmm, let me just check the, um, the notes here on account ADJ-20241105-SF.
164. Yes unfortunately it did process on November 1st, and looking at your file here I can see the adjustment code RTE-RIDESHARE-01 which indicates—this is related to commercial usage disclosure.
165. [sharp inhale] Let me check your original application from March, just give me one moment to review document APP-3847291-DC.
166. So I'm seeing here that, um, the rideshare disclosure was actually, uh, added to your file in October through form FRM-1099-UPDATE and that's what... hmm, that's what triggered the rate recalculation in system code CALC-88472-AUTO.
167. [exhales] Right, so what happened here is, um, and I see this a lot actually, uh, the initial policy didn't have the commercial endorsement code END-RS-2024 and when we received updated information it had to be, um, recalculated.
168. Exactly, rideshare driving requires specific coverage that costs more due to the increased risk factors documented in rate table RT-2024-Q4-COMM.
169. You're not slow at all David, insurance terminology is confusing and honestly I'm still learning some of it myself—let me see if there's any discount code I can apply to help offset this increase.
170. So, um, I found discount code DISC-SAFE-DRIVER-15 which gives you fifteen percent off and, uh, also I'm applying credit CRD-99847-LOYALTY for being with us over six months, so that should, hmm, bring your premium down by about seventy dollars total.
171. Thank you for calling. Um, let me just... pull up your account here. Could I get your, uh, order number or... if you have that handy?
172. That's okay. Take your time. Um, we can also look it up by, uh, your business name or email if that's... I mean, whatever's easier for you right now.
173. Perfect. Let me just... okay so I'm seeing, um, order number ORD-4429-SP91 here. Shipped November 15th. And, uh, you're asking about the... hmm, these additional charges that came through?
174. Right. So, um, I can see what happened here. The thing is—um, let me just—okay so your shipment crossed through, uh, multiple customs zones. Transaction ID TXN-88542-CU shows... hmm, how do I explain this...
175. Yeah so, um, it's actually... complicated. Your package went through, uh, through Newark first. Then London. Then, um, finally to Frankfurt. Each transfer point has its own... well, its own fee structure.
176. I completely understand your frustration. Um, looking at your account... reference number REF-2298-XK... these surcharges should have been, uh, disclosed during checkout. Let me see if... hmm, if something went wrong there.
177. So, um, I'm checking the system and, uh, there's a note here. Invoice INV-66019-B. It looks like... hmm, these fees were added after, um, after your shipment was already processed because of... weight recalculation?
178. I know. It doesn't... okay so, um, here's what I can do. I'm going to, uh, escalate this to our billing team. Case number CSE-90124-RT. And, um, we'll review whether these charges were... properly communicated.
179. Absolutely. Yes. Um, so let me just... I'm adding priority status. Code PRI-445. And, uh, between you and me? These international fees have been, um, causing issues for other merchants too. We're actually... reviewing the whole process.
180. So, um, with the priority code? Within 24 hours. Definitely. Uh, they'll call the number on file... ends in 7829? And they'll have, um, full authority to adjust these charges. Is that... will that work?
181. Oh! Um, hello Mr.—er, sorry, I didn't catch your, uh, your name there, but let me just, um, pull up your account and, uh, we'll get this sorted out for you, okay? So if you could just, um, give me your account number or, uh, maybe the order reference?
182. Perfect, so um, that's actually, uh—wait, let me just—okay so RFQ-2847-TK92, and I can see here that, um, you've been transferred... oh wow, uh, three times already today? That's, er, definitely not the experience we want for you, and um, I'm really sorry about that.
183. Okay so, um, let me dig into this because, uh, this is like a... what's the word... a priority institutional account, and um, I can see you ordered—er, sorry, let me scroll—forty-seven items with purchase order PON-88459-QD on October 12th, is that right?
184. Um, absolutely, and uh, I'm actually seeing something really, um, interesting here—so your order got, uh, split into three shipments, and um, it looks like tracking number TRK-9901245-A went to—wait no, sorry, that's the wrong—let me just double-check this for you.
185. No no, I've, um, I've got it! So uh, this is actually—oh! I see what happened here—your order got, er, flagged in our bulk processing system under code BLK-77234, and um, someone marked it as residential instead of institutional, which is, uh, why nobody could find it.
186. I know, it's, um, it's completely wrong and uh, I'm fixing it right now—so the good news is, er, all three shipments with tracking TRK-9901245-A, TRK-9901246-A, and TRK-9901247-A are actually, um, already at your receiving dock as of, uh, let me see... yesterday at 2:47 PM.
187. Um, yes! So like, they've been signed for by, uh, someone with initials JMK at your, um, at your loading dock, and uh, I'm sending you the, er, the delivery confirmations now to reference number CNF-445789-WD22.
188. Yeah, so um, the issue was that, uh, because of the residential flag, the system wasn't, er, wasn't linking it to your institutional account properly, which is like... what's the word... a database mismatch thing, but um, I've corrected it now under update code UPD-123477-R.
189. Oh! So, um, I'm actually adding a, uh, a special routing note to your account—it's like, er, a VIP flag basically—with code VIP-8834521, and um, I'm also giving you my direct extension which is, uh, 4479, so you can, um, bypass the regular queue entirely.
190. Perfect! And um, just so you know, I've also, uh, credited your account—it's showing as credit CRD-90128-KL—for, er, for all the trouble today, and um, that should appear within, uh, twenty-four to forty-eight hours, okay?
191. Oh! Um, okay so. Let me. Er, pull that up. Just need your account number or, uh, email?
192. No worries! That's, um, totally normal actually, so, uh, happens all the time. What email did you, er, use for the account?
193. Perfect. Got it. Um, so I'm seeing here, uh, account ID ACC-7829-MX91. Is that, er, for the premium subscription that started, hmm, back in August?
194. Completely understand! So, um, that's. That's frustrating. Let me just, uh, check here. Transaction TXN-445821-QR shows, er, three months of charges at $29.99?
195. Hey. It's okay. Really. Um, so like, this happens more than you'd think, and uh, we can definitely. We can fix this.
196. Absolutely. Canceling now. Done. Um, and so, I'm also seeing here that, er, we can issue a partial refund? For last month's charge under policy POL-8847-C?
197. Um, yes! So basically, uh, since you haven't logged in, er, for over 30 days according to, hmm, let me see... report RPT-2901-K. We can refund October.
198. Oh! Platinum. Let me. Um, so checking your status here, member ID MEM-55492-PL and, uh, you're right. Different policy applies.
199. So, um, processing full refund. All three months. Er, confirmation number is, uh, REF-78823-PLT and you'll see that in, hmm, 3-5 business days.
200. All done! Um, sent confirmation to your email. Receipt RCP-90127-X attached. And, uh, again? Don't feel bad. Happens constantly. You're all set.
201. Okay, um, let me just... pull that up here and, uh, I can definitely look into that for you... so what's the... hmm... the account number?
202. Right right, got it. So I'm seeing account 4-7-7-2-9 here and there's a charge for... let me find the exact... okay yes, Premium Monitoring activated October 15th with confirmation code PMN-88264-QV.
203. I understand you're frustrated and, um, I'm going to... what I can do is... hmm... I need to check the activation method...
204. So, uh, according to the system here, the service was, um, activated through your online portal with, er, transaction ID TXN-994527361 at 3:47 PM and there's a... hmm... what's the word... a digital signature.
205. I hear you, and while I can't remove validated charges... let me see what alternatives... okay so I can submit an audit request, case number AUD-7739-RF22, which takes 5-7 business days.
206. Or... actually wait, let me check something else here... pulling up your usage data...
207. Okay so, um, interesting... the monitoring service shows, uh, zero usage since activation, like, no logins, no alerts accessed, nothing... hmm...
208. Right right. So with zero usage I can... um, let me check our policy on... er... unused services... one sec...
209. Found it. So because there's no usage on record REC-55412-NM, I can escalate this to our billing review team with priority flag PRI-2847... they can authorize a partial credit.
210. So, um, here's what I'm doing... I'm adding notes about the, uh, zero usage, the confusion about activation, and, er, requesting full review under ticket TKT-338856-B which, hmm, between you and me? Usually gets approved for cases like this.
211. Oh yeah, so like, I totally get that – happens to me too actually, um, just last month with my car payment. So basically let me, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, what's your account number?
212. Got it got it.
213. Yeah so, um, I'm looking at account ACC-447298841 here and, uh, good news actually – you've never requested an extension before so like, basically we can definitely work with you on this.
214. So typically, um, we can do like seven to ten days, but uh, here's the thing – I see you've been with us for, hmm, three years? Never missed before? So I'm gonna, uh, put you down for fourteen days if that helps.
215. Honestly? Like my manager did the same for me when I was going through stuff, so, um, yeah. Extension code EXT-92847-TMP is, uh, already being processed and basically you'll get the confirmation in like five minutes.
216. Exactly right.
217. So like, um, I know it's stressful but uh, here's what I always tell myself – you called, you handled it, that's, um, that's actually really responsible? Transaction TXN-884291-EX is all set and like, no late fees or anything.
218. Oh absolutely, so um, that's actually super smart because, uh, then you never have to like worry about dates again. Let me, hmm, send you the autopay setup link to, uh, the email we have on file here.
219. No I mean, uh, I hear you – like technology right? But um, honestly between you and me, it's saved me so many times. Reference number REF-20847-AP for the, uh, autopay instructions and like, you can set it for any day that works.
220. So basically yeah, um, you're totally set – payment due the 28th now, confirmation CON-449281-X should hit your inbox, and uh, autopay info coming too. Like, you handled it all so, um, genuinely nothing to worry about now.
221. Oh hey, yeah, let me pull that up for you—actually, funny thing, my kid's on a travel team so I totally get the whole hotel situation, those road trips add up fast, right? What's the confirmation number or the, uh, the date of stay?
222. Got it, got it—so I'm seeing here... okay there's a reservation REF-7823-JM from June fifteenth, and it looks like there were some incidental charges posted to room, let me just... yeah, three hundred forty-two dollars in incidentals on top of the room rate.
223. Oh man, I hear you—freelance coaching is tough, my brother-in-law does basketball camps and it's feast or famine, you know? Looking at the breakdown here, charge code INC-4421-A shows a hundred fifty for what looks like room service, then there's INC-4421-B for ninety-two dollars marked as minibar...
224. Yeah no, totally fair question—honestly, hotels are notorious for this stuff, I had a charge once for a bathrobe I never even saw... Let me dig deeper into transaction log TXN-882934-C here, sometimes the descriptions are wrong or they accidentally charge the wrong room.
225. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I get it. So what I'm—let me just—actually, you know what? Since this is from three months back, I can file this under case number DSP-9847-TL as a delayed dispute, which gives us more options to work with.
226. No no, not stupid at all—basically means we can investigate even though it's past the normal sixty-day window, and honestly between you and me, dispute code DSP gives us way more flexibility than a standard inquiry would.
227. Fair. Completely fair. Tell you what—I'm gonna email you right now, reference number EML-7823-JP, with the exact dispute process timeline, and you'll get an automated confirmation from our system, not from me, showing case DSP-9847-TL is officially opened.
228. Right? That's like—what, forty bags of chips? Look, I'm seeing pattern code PAT-881 here which flags unusually high minibar charges, happens a lot when the sensor gets triggered multiple times or someone restocks wrong...
229. Yeah, I—look, here's what I'm gonna do. Putting a provisional credit PCT-9923-K for half the amount right now, hundred seventy-one dollars, while we investigate, so at least you've got something back immediately instead of waiting.
230. Already processing—you'll see credit PCT-9923-K within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and honestly, with that sensor flag I mentioned? We'll probably get the rest reversed too, these things usually go our way when there's a pattern.
231. Oh no worries at all. Um, let me just pull that right up for you and, uh, we'll get this sorted before anything happens. Can I get your claim number? It'd start with CLM-
232. Got it.
233. Hey, um, you're calling now and that's what matters. So I'm looking at CLM-7924-RG here and, uh, I can see this is for roofing materials, and... hmm, let me make sure we expedite this properly because storm season's coming.
234. Right right.
235. No no no, you're not being dramatic at all. Um, this is your livelihood we're talking about here. So, uh, I'm gonna flag this with priority code PRI-8856-STORM and, er, basically that puts you at the front of the line...
236. Actually, um, I absolutely do need to do this for you. See, your original submission date was March 15th, so you're well within the window, and uh, with your contractor license CON-4429-FL on file, you qualify for our professional expedited service that, hmm, honestly someone should've told you about...
237. Um, listen, between dealing with suppliers and customers and weather... uh, I'm gonna make sure this gets processed by end of day tomorrow. Your approval should show as APP-7924-CONFIRMED.
238. Normally yes, but um, here's what I'm doing—and I'm documenting everything in case note CN-58847—I'm marking this as weather-critical infrastructure, which, uh, it technically is since you're protecting homes before storms hit...
239. Oh... Um, I'm so sorry. That must've been... Look, uh, I'm putting my direct extension in here—it's 4-7-7-2—and if anything, er, if there's any delay at all, you call me directly and I'll... I'll handle it personally.
240. Um, hey, you're not a mess, you're prepared. And, uh, that's exactly what your customers need right now. Check your email for confirmation EML-7924-SENT in about, hmm, five minutes, and we're gonna make sure you're ready for whatever weather comes.
241. Oh man, I actually—wait, let me just—I literally had this happen to me last week with a coffee maker, so I totally get how frustrating that is when you see the price drop right after.
242. Absolutely, so um—let me just—okay so I need to, uh, pull up your account here and, um, when did you say you purchased it? And, er, do you happen to have that order number?
243. Perfect, so I'm—wait, actually that's—um, is that the receipt number or, uh, because I need the order number which should be like, um, ORD and then some numbers?
244. Okay okay, so, um, I've got it here and, uh, wow you weren't kidding, it dropped, um, thirty dollars today, so let me—I mean, I'm gonna—actually, um, you know what? I'm just gonna process this right now.
245. No no, um, there's really no catch, I mean—so the thing is—uh, we have this price protection policy for, um, seven days after purchase, and your order ORD-77453-MK92 is, uh, definitely within that window, so it's actually, um, really straightforward.
246. Oh totally fair question—so I'm actually—I just submitted it, and you should get an email confirmation in about two minutes with reference number ADJ-9982341-C showing the thirty dollar credit.
247. Yeah so, um, while that's processing, I just—uh, I wanted to mention, like, for future reference? Um, you can actually, er, set up price drop alerts in your account so you don't have to, um, check manually.
248. I hear you—and um, honestly? Like, I've been—uh, I mean, I work here and even I've been, um, burned by price changes before, so I totally get why you'd be, uh, hesitant to trust the system.
249. Right right, so um, standard processing is, uh, three to five but—okay so, um, between you and me? These usually, er, go through in like, um, 24 hours, they just say longer to be safe.
250. It is, yeah—and hey, I added a note to your account about this, so if there's any issue—which there won't be—but if there is, just reference case number CSE-108847-P and any rep can see exactly what we did today.
251. Oh, I'm definitely gonna help you verify that—let me pull up our outbound log for today, just need your number so I can check what happened there.
252. Got that, and I'm seeing... hmm, no calls from us today to that number, but I think maybe it could've been a spoofed number—let me check yesterday's log too, reference REF-2024-89421.
253. Yeah, probably—and look, I'm gonna make sure you know exactly how to spot our real calls, okay? First thing, we always start with your account number ACC-7821-M, never ask for your full social.
254. Okay that's—that's definitely not us, and I'm sort of worried now about what else they might've asked for—did you give them any information at all?
255. No no, yours is ACC-7821-M, and between you and me? Scammers just throw random numbers out there hoping you'll bite—they probably said eight-two-something to sound official.
256. Seven-eight-two-one, ACC-7821-M, and I'm gonna put a security flag on your account right now with code SEC-90142 so nobody can access anything without extra verification.
257. Well I can't know exactly what they asked, but I think they probably went for passwords, credit cards maybe—the usual stuff—and I'm gonna email you our fraud guide FRD-2024-067 right now.
258. Okay listen—and I'm kinda breaking protocol here—but I'm gonna transfer you straight to our fraud team, skip the queue with priority code PRI-88723, they'll lock everything down immediately.
259. Eight-eight-seven-two-three, PRI-88723, and honestly? Just tell them Sarah sent you—they'll probably take extra good care of you, make sure nothing bad happens here.
260. Transferring right now, and remember—reference number REF-2024-89421 for this call, and I've already flagged everything so they'll see it—you're gonna be totally protected, I promise.
261. Um, okay so, uh, let me just... I'm gonna fix this for you, I mean, this shouldn't be happening. Can you, um, give me your account email so I can, uh, pull up your profile? I'm seeing a lot of payment issues today with, er, account PYM-8827-QA status codes.
262. Got it. Okay. So.
263. Right so, um, I'm looking at your account USR-9042-KLW and, uh, yeah I see exactly what's... it's like... hmm, there's this weird flag on your payment module. Um, probably from the system update. But no. We're fixing this. Right now.
264. Um, so here's what I'm gonna, uh, I think I can... let me try something. Your payment token TKN-5581-BX9 is, um, sort of stuck in this, like, validation loop? And, uh, technically I'm not supposed to manually override but, er, you need to work, right?
265. Okay okay.
266. So, um, I'm just... hang on... bypassing the, uh, what's the word... the verification queue. Your new payment ID will be, er, PID-7703-MNQ2 and, um, I'm sort of forcing it through the backend. Should work now.
267. Um, yeah so, uh, try it now and, er, let me know what you see because, hmm, sometimes it takes like a second to, you know, propagate through the system.
268. Yes! See? Um, I told you we'd, uh, we'd get this sorted. Your confirmation is, er, CNF-4429-RTK8. And, um, probably save that just in case, but you should be, like, totally good now.
269. Um, so listen, uh, if this happens again? Reference ticket, er, TKT-6801-VMP9. Ask for escalation. I'm putting notes that, um, you're a priority account because, uh, freelancers shouldn't have to deal with this, you know?
270. Absolutely. Um, that's what I'm here for, right? So your case number is, uh, CSE-3390-QWZ1 if you need anything else. And, er, good luck with that invoice tomorrow!
271. Oh! Okay okay, let me see here, hmm, I'm pulling up your account right now and um I'll get this sorted real quick for you, what's your account number or phone number so I can, uh, find everything?
272. Got it got it! Okay so, hmm, I see account ACC-4829-BX here and, uh, wow there's definitely a note from Tuesday saying they'd waive that charge, let me just, um, dig deeper into what happened because this should've been done already!
273. No no, this isn't right at all! Hmm, so what I'm seeing here, um, the rep put in request REQ-77541-Q but, uh, it got stuck in processing? That's super weird, let me just, okay so I'm gonna push this through myself right now!
274. Absolutely! Yes yes yes, I'm, um, already on it, so like, hmm, I'm overriding the stuck request and, uh, creating a new one, TKT-93026-AL, and boom! Should process in like ten minutes tops!
275. No no wait! Don't give up! Let me see here, um, I'm also adding priority flag PRI-8847 so it can't get stuck again, and, uh, you know what? I'm putting my direct extension 5509 in your notes so if anything goes wrong you can call me directly!
276. Of course of course! Hmm, and actually, um, while I have you here, I see you've been with us three years? I'm gonna, uh, add credit CRD-2156-X for the inconvenience, twenty dollars, because this shouldn't have happened!
277. Oh oh! And, um, let me just confirm, so everything's processing now under reference REF-60923-KLP and, uh, you should get an email in like, hmm, five minutes with all the details!
278. Yes! But but but, um, I'm also staying on to make sure it goes through! Hmm, actually yeah, I can see status code STS-COMPLETE just popped up so, uh, it's working! Check your email!
279. Yay! Perfect perfect! And and remember, um, you've got my extension 5509 if you need anything else, plus that credit should show as TXN-44892-P on your next bill!
280. Aww, hmm, that's so nice! Just doing my job but, um, with extra enthusiasm! Is there, uh, anything else at all I can help with while I have everything pulled up?
281. Oh totally understand that concern, um, let me just pull up your account here and, uh, we can verify everything... what's your account number or email address?
282. Yeah no, completely fair, um, so here's what we can do... I can, uh, verify information that only we would have, like your last transaction TXN-445892-YK was on October 15th for $47.23, does that sound right?
283. You know what, um, I actually had the same thing happen to my mom last month... someone pretending to be her bank and, er, it's scary stuff so I totally get why you're being careful here.
284. Right right, um, so what I can do is, uh, give you our verification code VRF-8829-QM12 and you can hang up, call the number on our official website, and, er, give them that code to confirm this conversation is legitimate...
285. Hmm, okay so, um, let me think... actually, uh, you could also just log into your account online while we're talking and I can, er, send a secure message there with reference number REF-7736-PL?
286. Got it.
287. I can see that, yes, um, premium since 2016 actually... account PRE-00847-ZN... and, uh, while you're logging in, just so you know, we'd never ask for your full card number over email, only the last four digits for verification...
288. Um, okay so that's... let me check if there's, uh, any security locks... sometimes if someone tries to access... hmm, yeah I see three failed attempts from a different IP address this morning...
289. Looking at this, um, yeah someone definitely tried to get into your account around, er, 9:47 AM from an IP that's not yours... but the system blocked them so, uh, your account's safe, just locked as a precaution.
290. Absolutely, um, so I'm gonna, er, unlock it right now with temporary code TMP-9903-BK22, and uh, honestly? I'd also set up two-factor authentication while you're in there... takes like thirty seconds and, um, prevents this stuff... there, you should be able to log in now.
291. Right. Okay. So let me just—actually wait—I'm pulling up the reimbursement portal now. What's your employee ID so I can—no, we're gonna get this sorted for you.
292. E44789, got it. Okay so I'm seeing... hmm. Your account shows pending status since—wait, since October? That's not right. Let me dig into claim number CLM-99204-TRE here because this shouldn't be taking three months.
293. No no no. This is—let me just—this is unacceptable. Your documentation packet DPC-88516-A shows received and complete. HR signed off. Academic Affairs signed off. So why is Finance just... sitting on this?
294. Don't apologize. You're right to be—actually, I'm escalating this. Right now. Case ESC-70923-B is being created and I'm marking it priority because three months for tuition reimbursement is absolutely not our standard.
295. You're not causing—no, listen. Faculty development funds are... they're meant to be used. Not held hostage. Your submission SUB-44789-OCT shows you followed every single protocol. This is our failure. Not yours.
296. Let me be clear. Form TRF-2023-Q4 that you submitted? Perfect. Every field. Every signature. Even attachment ATT-6B with your course syllabus from the university. Nothing wrong here.
297. Stop. Apologizing. Actually—hang on—I'm seeing something in the system. Note NTE-55412 says "awaiting secondary approval" but... but you already have that. From October fifteenth.
298. Right right. So this is just... stuck. In some bureaucratic loop. But here's what I'm—no wait—here's what we're doing. Override code OVR-30019-XM lets me bypass that secondary approval flag since it's already there.
299. Absolutely allowed. When the system fails, we fix it. And... done. Payment authorization PAY-78823-EDU is now active. Should process within... forty-eight hours. Seventy-two max.
300. You were patient. Systematic. Clear. Everything an academic advisor should be when our finance department drops the ball. Check your email for confirmation CNF-44789-COMPLETE, and if this isn't in your account by Friday? Call me directly. Extension 4-5-5-2.
301. Oh! Um, I'm so—let me just—sorry about that, uh, double charge situation, let me pull up your account here and, hmm, what's your—actually wait, I need your member ID first, do you have that handy?
302. Okay so, um, BK-4428-TW, got it, and I'm—uh, I'm seeing here that there's, hmm, two charges for $89.99 on October 15th, transaction IDs are TXN-7739901 and, um, TXN-7739944, which is—yeah that's definitely not right.
303. Right right, um, so here's what—no wait, let me just—okay so I see a, uh, credit was issued but then it's like... hmm, what's the word... it got reversed? On November 2nd under reference REF-8827-QM.
304. I'm really sorry about—wait actually, oh! I see what happened here! The system flagged your account code ACC-4428-TW91 as commercial but you're registered as personal, so when the billing cycle reset it automatically reapplied the charge!
305. Got it got it.
306. Absolutely, so what I'm—um, let me just—I'm processing a full refund right now, uh, confirmation number will be CNF-9901-XK, and I'm also, hmm, updating your account classification to hybrid-use which should prevent this from happening again.
307. Actually—and I'm, um, really sorry again about all this—I'm adding a courtesy credit of $25 to your account, credit ID CRD-5567-PP, plus your next service call will be complimentary!
308. Oh! Also—wait this is good—I just noticed you've been with us eight years under member ID MBR-4428-LEGACY so I'm upgrading you to our platinum tier which gives you priority dispatch!
309. Yeah so basically, um, whenever you call in, your code PRI-4428-GOLD puts you, uh, at the top of the queue, and, um, average response time drops from forty-five minutes to like fifteen!
310. Thank you so much for being patient with me! Your refund reference RFD-9901-XK should show up in three to five business days, and your new platinum benefits are active immediately!
311. Hi there! Um, I'm—let me just—I'm happy to help. Er, walk through this. Together. Step by step, okay? Um, can you, uh, give me your account? Number?
312. Okay so, um, that's K-R-7-9-3-2, and uh, I've got—no wait, let me just—perfect! Um, I see it. Your account. Er, what part? Of the bill. Is, uh, confusing?
313. Ah, um, okay! So there's, uh, an additional charge. Let me, er, explain each one. Really clearly. Um, line TXN-8847-PQ shows, uh, international roaming. Twenty-two dollars.
314. I understand. Let's check. When exactly. So on October fifteenth. Your phone. Connected to. A Canadian tower?
315. Um, it's okay. Really. Er, sometimes phones—let me just—sometimes they connect. Accidentally. Uh, are you near? The border? At all?
316. Ah! Um, that explains it. So, uh, your phone—it probably just—er, picked up a tower. By mistake. Um, happens all the time. Really common.
317. No no! Um, not at all. Er, let me just—I'm going to—uh, credit this. Right now. Reference number, um, CRD-5509-MZ. All twenty-two dollars.
318. Your English. Is great! Really. And um, I added. A note. File code NTE-8823-LP. To prevent. Future charges.
319. Of course! That's why. I'm here. To teach. To explain. Everything clearly.
320. Um, thank you! Er, that means—that's really, uh, kind. Is there, um, anything else? I can, er, explain today? About your account ACC-7932-KR?
321. Oh gosh, I'm, um, I'm really sorry to hear that's happening—let me pull up your account right away, could you give me your account number or the email associated with it?
322. Got it, yahoo, perfect—okay so I'm seeing account ACC-4492-JM here, and um, I'm really sorry but I need to check a few things because this is, well, this is definitely concerning.
323. No no no, I mean, let me just, hmm, let me see here... okay so your current balance is showing zero but I can see transaction history TRX-8827-QP91 from yesterday showing the full balance, so something's definitely not right here.
324. Right right, I completely understand the urgency—I'm seeing a pending transfer request PTR-0934-XX that was, um, initiated at 3:47 AM this morning, did you authorize any transfers around that time?
325. Okay so, um, I'm really, really sorry but it looks like we might be dealing with, uh, unauthorized access here—I'm immediately flagging this with security reference SEC-7745-UNA and we're going to freeze everything right now.
326. Let me see here... the transfer shows routing to an external account EXT-9902-Z but—and this is good news—it's still in our 24-hour security hold period so we can reverse it.
327. Absolutely, yes—I'm initiating reversal RVS-3384-JM right now and, um, I know this is scary but your funds should be back within, let me check... two to four hours maximum.
328. It'll definitely be before tomorrow morning, and I'm also adding enhanced security protocol ESP-6672-A to your account which includes two-factor authentication so this can't happen again.
329. Yes, definitely—after we hang up, you'll get an email with reset link RST-4419-PWD and, um, I'd also recommend checking if any other accounts share that same password because, well, better safe than sorry.
330. Exactly, three hours should show everything restored, and you'll get confirmation number CNF-8823-COMPLETE when it processes—and again, I'm really, really sorry this happened but we've got it handled now.
331. Well, yes, I'm, you know, the membership chair, and um, we've been reviewing your application for the past few weeks — there are some, honestly, concerns we need to discuss.
332. So, it's not exactly about credentials, I mean, though those matter — it's more about, er, the fit with our existing membership and, basically, whether you align with our values and traditions.
333. Look, several members have [upset] expressed reservations about your public statements regarding our organization last year — you called us elitist and out of touch in that campus newspaper interview, remember?
334. Even if that's true, you have to [shaky voice] understand that our members value loyalty and discretion — we can't have someone who might publicly criticize us from the inside.
335. It's not, you know, a rejection yet — we're giving you, I guess, an opportunity to address these concerns, though honestly, the vote is scheduled for tomorrow and it's, kind of, not looking favorable.
336. See, that attitude right there is part of the problem — you're positioning yourself as a critic rather than someone who wants to contribute positively to our community.
337. Oh, we absolutely, uhh, [excited] welcome diversity of thought! It's just that, well, there's a difference between constructive dialogue and, you know, public antagonism.
338. Those are admirable values, but the Meridian Society has operated successfully for 127 years with our current approach — we're not looking to be reformed or revolutionized.
339. We want members who understand that belonging to something exclusive means respecting its traditions and working within established channels for any changes they'd like to see.
340. Actually, that's, hmm, another concern — we need authentic buy-in, not just, you know, someone going through the motions, so maybe, really, this isn't the right fit after all.
341. Wait, what? I've already prepped all the ingredients for eight people, and the salmon is marinating as we speak. This is the third time this month you've done this to me.
342. Your cousin who lives in Portland? The one who supposedly visited last week when you cancelled the anniversary dinner? Come on, you need to level with me here.
343. Oh for— I mean, are you [loudly] kidding me right now? I've got, er, forty pounds of food here, basically, everything from appetizers to that special chocolate soufflé you specifically requested!
344. That's not how, well, [bored] this works, honestly — everything was, uhh, customized to your guests' dietary restrictions. Sarah's vegan, Tom's gluten-free, and Marcus is allergic to everything under the sun.
345. Not feeling social? You know, it's actually, kind of frustrating when you treat my, uh, entire livelihood like it's disposable.
346. Money isn't, honestly, the only issue here, though — it's about, you know, respect for my time and, er, the fact that I turned down other clients for you.
347. Scale it down? I've already [loudly] prepared courses for eight people! What am I supposed to do with six extra portions of beef Wellington? You can't just uncook food!
348. This is exactly why I'm thinking about dropping you as a client. Every event becomes this exhausting negotiation where I have to salvage your last-minute changes.
349. Yeah, two years of, well, constant rescheduling and, you know, me bending over backwards while you treat dinner parties like, hmm, they're optional dentist appointments.
350. Great, except now I need to reheat everything and pray the soufflé doesn't completely deflate. Next time, we're putting a cancellation policy in writing with a 48-hour minimum notice.
351. So, we're starting with, um, fifty dollars minimum buy-in, and I mean, the blinds are five and ten. Everyone's chips are counted and ready, you've got your stack of two thousand right there in front of you.
352. That's just the chip count, not actual dollars—we're playing tournament style tonight. First card coming to you is the seven of hearts, and your neighbor gets the king of diamonds.
353. Your second card is— [gasp softly] oh wow, that's the seven of spades! Pocket sevens right off the bat, and the current pot is already at fifteen with the blinds.
354. Forty going in, and your opponent is [bitter] thinking hard about this one. The pot's now at fifty-five, and here comes the flop: queen of hearts, seven of diamonds, two of clubs.
355. That's three sevens for you, [bored] which puts the odds at about forty-five to one. Current pot value is fifty-five, and your opponent just checked to you.
356. One hundred into the pot, [whispering loudly] and, well, your opponent is, hmm, really sweating now—the pot's at one fifty-five. They're calling though, so here comes the turn card: jack of clubs.
357. Two hundred more, so, the pot's climbing to, uh, three fifty-five now, basically a massive pot for this early in the game. Your opponent is tanking, counting their chips—they've got about fourteen hundred left.
358. They're pushing all-in, actually, [very meekly] which means, um, another fourteen hundred into the pot, and I mean, that makes it, er, seventeen fifty-five total. You'd need to call twelve hundred to stay in.
359. Cards are flipping over and— [cry loudly] oh no, they have pocket queens! That's a higher set, which gives them a ninety-six percent chance to win with just the river card left.
360. The river is the three of hearts, [shouting] and the pocket queens take it! Final pot of twenty-nine fifty-five goes to your opponent, leaving you with just fifty in chips for the rebuy.
361. Open mic nights are [laugh hard] brutal, honestly. You're basically throwing yourself to the wolves—drunk crowds, hecklers, people who'd rather be on their phones than watching you struggle through your set.
362. Practicing is, well, one thing, but actually, you know, performing is completely different, I mean, when you're up there alone. The lights make you sweat, your voice cracks, and suddenly every joke you thought was funny falls completely flat.
363. Just being realistic—ninety percent of first-timers bomb completely. The silence after a failed punchline is devastating, and trust me, it stays with you for weeks afterward, replaying in your mind.
364. Three times, and, uh, each one was worse than the last, honestly, like the audience could smell my fear or something. The worst part is watching other performers kill it while you're sitting there knowing you're about to die up there.
365. Friends lie to you [apologetic] though, they'll say you're funny even when you're not. At least strangers give you honest feedback through their complete indifference or worse, their visible discomfort.
366. Look, I'm not trying [very loudly] to crush your dreams here! It's just that solo performance is incredibly isolating—you're completely exposed up there with nowhere to hide when things go wrong.
367. Sure, try it once, but prepare for the emotional hangover. Most people quit after their first attempt because the rejection feels so personal—it's not like bombing in a group where you can share the blame.
368. Regret is a strong word, but I definitely wish I'd had realistic expectations. The fantasy of being discovered or getting big laughs is so far from the reality of stumbling through five minutes while people order drinks.
369. You'll probably do it anyway despite my warnings. Everyone thinks they'll be different, that their material is stronger, that they won't freeze up—but the stage has a way of humbling everyone equally.
370. Fine, but don't say [stern] I didn't warn you. When you're up there dying, remember this conversation and know that I tried to prepare you for the crushing weight of performing alone.
371. Oh that's, um, fascinating! I've read about bug bounties but, you know, never met someone who actually does it. How did you even get started with something like that—do you need, er, specific certifications or training?
372. That's so, well, impressive that you're [very excited] self-taught! I mean, most people assume you'd need years of formal cybersecurity education, but here you are, actually, finding real vulnerabilities that companies pay for.
373. Fifty dollars for your first find is, honestly, pretty good—I've heard, like, some people spend months before getting anything. What kind of vulnerability was it, if you don't mind me asking, or, I guess, is that something you're not supposed to share?
374. Cross-site scripting sounds deceptively simple but it can lead to serious security breaches, right? I remember reading about how attackers can steal session cookies or redirect users to malicious sites through XSS vulnerabilities.
375. Have you, er, found any really interesting bugs since then, the kind that, basically, make you feel like a detective? I imagine some vulnerabilities must be hidden pretty deep in the code or, hmm, require creative thinking to discover.
376. Three thousand dollars for one bug—that's incredible! Authentication bypasses are serious business because they essentially let attackers walk through the front door without a key, potentially accessing sensitive user data or administrative functions.
377. Two weeks seems like a solid investment for that payout though. The documentation part must be crucial—companies probably need clear proof and reproduction steps before they'll acknowledge and pay for a vulnerability report.
378. I can imagine the writeups are, actually, tedious—you're essentially teaching someone else, well, how to break their own system. Do you have to include proof-of-concept code or, like, video demonstrations to show the exploit in action?
379. The uncertainty must be stressful, especially after investing so much time. Have you ever had a submission rejected that you were absolutely certain was a legitimate vulnerability?
380. That's a mature perspective—rejection probably stings initially but becomes a learning opportunity. Bug bounty seems like this fascinating blend of technical skill, persistence, and understanding how different companies evaluate risk.
381. Yeah, uh, it's pretty wild—I basically help investigate maritime crimes by, you know, analyzing biological evidence from ocean crime scenes, kind of like CSI but underwater.
382. Oh absolutely! Everything from illegal fishing operations to smuggling routes to occasionally helping identify victims. The ocean tells stories through its biology if you know how to read it.
383. Well, so, different waters have, er, unique microscopic organisms—diatoms, basically—that stick to objects, and I can, honestly, trace where something or someone has been.
384. Sometimes, yeah! We'll board vessels and I'll, [happy], sample their catch or, you know, check for protected species. It's actually way more exciting than, well, regular lab work.
385. Oh man, err, last year we busted this, [laugh histerically], absolutely brazen shark finning operation—they had, like, thousands of fins hidden under legal fish! The captain tried to, basically, convince us they were "naturally shed."
386. Exactly! But, hmm, the biological evidence goes deeper—we can, sort of, DNA test to prove which species, and, actually, even match fins to specific carcasses sometimes.
387. Right? The other day we, uh, analyzed barnacle growth patterns to, [gasp loudly], prove a smuggling boat had been in, honestly, three different illegal fishing zones over six months!
388. Pretty much! Different species grow in, well, different regions, and their, you know, growth rates tell us timing. It's, honestly, like reading tree rings but for criminal boats.
389. They try! But, actually, microscopic organisms are, hmm, basically impossible to completely remove. Even bleach leaves, you know, traces we can detect with the right equipment.
390. It really is! I mean, one day I'm studying, uh, coral reproduction, the next I'm, basically, testifying about how algae patterns prove someone was, actually, poaching in protected waters.
391. Well, I grew up near the coast and, uh, spent basically every summer in tide pools. My grandmother, you know, taught me all the Latin names for everything—she was actually this badass oceanographer in the sixties.
392. Oh absolutely! She was one of [speeding up] like twelve women in her entire program and she discovered three new species of nudibranchs. She used to smuggle me onto research vessels when I was eight.
393. Right? So, she'd tell them I was, hmm, the "junior research assistant" and, basically, nobody questioned it because, well, she was terrifying when crossed.
394. Oh completely—she always said rules are suggestions if you're smart enough to know which ones matter. That's probably why I ended up in this weird intersection of science and crime investigation.
395. Exactly! I mean, yesterday I was, er, analyzing stomach contents from seized tuna to, basically, prove they were caught in protected waters—it's like, honestly, detective work meets biology class.
396. Yeah! Different regions have, you know, unique plankton populations, and, hmm, the partially digested stuff tells us, basically, exactly where they were hunting forty-eight hours before capture.
397. Right?
398. The stories I could tell you—like this one time we caught poachers because barnacles on their anchor had a rare parasite only found near Madagascar.
399. They absolutely did! The poachers tried to claim they'd [mocking] "never left local waters" but, um, those microscopic hitchhikers, well, completely destroyed their alibi in court.
400. Ha! Well, my grandmother would, err, definitely approve—she always said, actually, the best scientists are, you know, the ones who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty catching the bad guys.
401. Yes! We're expanding our [cough] luxury treatment menu next month and need someone who really understands both the technical side and the whole client experience aspect. Have you worked with volcanic basalt stones before?
402. Oh no, the stone composition, you know, actually matters tremendously—basalt holds heat, um, fifty percent longer than granite, and well, the mineral content affects how it transfers energy to muscle tissue.
403. Most people don't [curious] realize it, but, hmm, proper spa therapy is basically, you know, applied anatomy mixed with thermal physics and a solid understanding of lymphatic drainage patterns.
404. Exactly! I mean, yesterday I had to, er, recalibrate our entire aromatherapy diffusion system because, basically, the molecular weight of bergamot oil wasn't dispersing properly in our new treatment rooms.
405. It's crucial for proper absorption rates! Different essential oils penetrate the epidermis at varying speeds, and if you're combining them with heated stones, you need to account for increased permeability.
406. We're definitely more specialized—our clients include professional athletes and people recovering from surgeries, so everything needs to be precisely calibrated for therapeutic outcomes, not just relaxation.
407. We require at least 1,000 hours of documented training, plus specialized certifications in neuromuscular therapy and myofascial release techniques, and ideally some background in sports medicine or physical therapy.
408. The liability insurance alone, hmm, costs us forty thousand a year because, well, we're doing legitimate therapeutic work that, basically, borders on medical treatment.
409. That's why we pay our therapists between eighty and one-twenty an hour, depending on their specializations—you can't expect medical-grade expertise at minimum wage prices.
410. Pretty much! We need someone who, um, understands that they're, well, essentially performing therapeutic interventions that, actually, require the same precision as any clinical procedure.
411. Yeah, so, I manage the entire, um, transactional data pipeline from our PostgreSQL clusters through, well, the ETL processes that [mumbling] feed into our Snowflake warehouse, basically coordinating with the sales analytics team on query optimization.
412. Business-to-consumer transactions require completely different indexing strategies than B2B—we're talking millions of atomized transactions with high cardinality customer IDs versus thousands of bulk corporate purchases with predictable patterns.
413. Well, it's more complex—like, our sharded MongoDB instances handle, hmm, real-time inventory decrements while, basically, maintaining ACID compliance across distributed nodes for payment processing.
414. Not when you're, uh, processing forty thousand concurrent transactions during, honestly, peak hours while maintaining, err, sub-millisecond response times for our recommendation engine's collaborative filtering algorithms.
415. We use, hmm, two-phase commit protocols with, basically, distributed locks managed through Redis, plus, um, event sourcing patterns that let us rebuild state from our Kafka streams if anything fails.
416. Every cart modification, product view, and checkout event gets [slurring] published as immutable events, which our Spark clusters process through sliding window aggregations for real-time sales velocity calculations.
417. [shy] We have to track everything for our machine learning pipelines—the TensorFlow models need granular clickstream data to predict conversion probability and optimize dynamic pricing strategies in real-time.
418. The pricing engine pulls from seventeen different data sources including competitor APIs, inventory levels, historical elasticity curves, and even weather data to adjust margins within predetermined business rules.
419. Absolutely—umbrella sales spike 340% during rain forecasts, so our predictive models pre-adjust inventory allocation and pricing tiers based on meteorological data feeds integrated directly into our data lake.
420. Most people don't, um, realize that modern B2C platforms are, [clearing throat], essentially real-time data processing engines where, actually, the shopping cart is just the UI layer on top of incredibly complex distributed systems.
421. Oh man, yeah, there's this whole community of urban explorers who document these places before they're demolished or renovated. The stories these buildings hold are incredible.
422. Well, technically it's, um, trespassing in most cases, but like, many explorers follow this code - take only pictures, leave only footprints, you know? The legal gray area depends on posted signs and local laws.
423. There was this psychiatric hospital from the 1960s with patient files still scattered everywhere, children's drawings on the walls, and a room full of rusted wheelchairs arranged in a perfect circle. Someone had been there after abandonment.
424. The creepy part isn't the decay - it's finding evidence of recent visitors, fresh graffiti over decades-old paint, sleeping bags in corners. You realize these places aren't as abandoned as you thought.
425. Never. Going solo is asking for trouble - structural collapse, getting lost, injuries with no help. Plus having someone else there keeps you grounded when the atmosphere gets too heavy.
426. The real dangers are [quickly] actually, uh, way more mundane - asbestos, er, lead paint, basically unstable floors, tetanus from rusty metal. Though I'll admit the psychological weight of these spaces can mess with your head.
427. So there's, I mean, online forums where people share locations, but honestly, the best finds come from just driving around industrial areas, like, looking for overgrown fences and, well, boarded windows.
428. Here's the thing, er, starting with something small like an abandoned house is, actually, way less intimidating than diving into a massive factory or hospital complex, I guess.
429. Hmm, most truly abandoned places can't afford security, but, anyway, some have motion sensors or, basically, periodic patrols, so you've got to do reconnaissance first, right?
430. That's, uhh, exactly what draws people in - this collision between decay and beauty, where, sort of, nature reclaims human spaces and, honestly, every peeling wall tells a story about impermanence, you know?
431. Well, I did that, um, project management course last quarter, but honestly, it was pretty basic stuff I already knew. The company paid for it though, so, you know, I figured why not take advantage of the budget while it's there.
432. It's just that most of these programs feel, hmm, really generic—they teach you frameworks like SWOT analysis that, I mean, everyone already knows. But I guess it looks decent on the annual review, and my manager seemed happy I did something.
433. Yeah, I've heard about that one, actually, but the thing is, six months is a huge commitment for something that, well, might not translate to actual promotions. My colleague did it last year and she's still in the same role, just with more responsibilities now.
434. I suppose, [anxious], the technical certifications can help if you're, um, switching fields or negotiating salary, but for soft skills training? Most hiring managers care more about your actual experience than whether you completed some online leadership modules.
435. Networking events are probably more valuable, if I'm being honest. You meet people who can actually refer you to jobs rather than just collecting certificates that sit in your LinkedIn profile.
436. Sure, in, err, regulated industries [groan] or technical roles, but like, for general management? It's mostly theater—companies say they value continuous learning but then promote based on who plays politics best anyway.
437. Don't get me wrong, [laugh hard], I still do the trainings because free education is free education. Plus it's nice to occasionally learn something new, even if seventy percent of it is fluff and buzzwords.
438. The data analytics bootcamp was, hmm, actually useful because I learned Python, which, you know, opened up new project opportunities. But that's because it was a hard skill, not another workshop on emotional intelligence or strategic thinking.
439. Depends on your career path, really. If you want to stay hands-on, then yeah, technical skills pay off more immediately than soft skills training that everyone claims to offer but few actually need.
440. I'm not [child-like] completely against it, I just think people oversell these programs as career game-changers. Most of the time you're better off doing good work, building relationships, and learning on the job rather than chasing certificates.
441. Hey, I completely understand that disappointment. Festival rejections are never easy, especially when you see peers getting selected, but honestly every director I know has a drawer full of rejection letters.
442. Your dedication absolutely shows in your work, and, well, technical excellence is important, but festivals often look for, I mean, different things—sometimes it's about timing or what themes they're featuring this year, honestly.
443. No no, that's not what this means at all! You're incredibly talented, and one festival's decision doesn't define your worth as a filmmaker or diminish the quality of what you created.
444. Sometimes the most successful directors are the ones who took the longest to break through. Persistence combined with your competitive drive is actually a powerful combination that will serve you well in this industry.
445. I genuinely believe it because I've [regretful] been there myself, losing out on opportunities I desperately wanted. But those setbacks taught me more than any early success could have, and they made the wins so much sweeter.
446. Seven years of rejection after rejection, but during that time I was building skills, making connections, and developing my unique voice. The journey shapes you as much as the destination does.
447. Your drive is such an asset, truly. That competitive spirit will push you to keep improving and innovating, which is exactly what this industry needs from fresh voices like yours.
448. You could explore new things if you want, but don't [monotone] abandon what makes your work special. Your current style has merit, and authenticity always wins over trying to be something you're not.
449. That feeling is so valid, and it's okay to sit with that disappointment for a bit. Just remember that your journey is your own, and comparing timelines rarely leads anywhere productive or peaceful.
450. You're not falling behind, you're building something meaningful at your own pace. The best directors I know channel that competitive energy into their craft rather than comparisons, and I see that potential in you already.
451. Yes, um, this is completely new territory for me, you know, and I'm actually fascinated by the historical connections! The art form has such rich roots in Victorian theater and social commentary that most people never realize exists.
452. Oh absolutely, uh, I spent three hours backstage earlier, like, taking notes on costume construction, and honestly the level of detail is incredible! Each rhinestone placement tells a story, and the performers explained how every element from the music selection to the choreography contains layers of meaning.
453. I completely [exhausted] agree with that assessment, and after today's interviews I'm even more convinced! The physical demands alone are extraordinary, and the performers train for years to master the combination of dance, theater, and audience engagement.
454. Hmm, the thing is, I'm examining how contemporary burlesque reclaims and subverts historical gender narratives, anyway. The performers are actively rewriting what sensuality and empowerment mean in modern contexts, which connects beautifully to my broader work on performance studies.
455. Absolutely, uhh, it's just that the interactive energy here is unlike anything in conventional performance spaces, you know! The audience becomes part of the show through their reactions and participation, creating this incredible feedback loop that shapes each performance uniquely.
456. Initially some were skeptical, but the depth of cultural analysis possible here is undeniable! Burlesque intersects with sociology, gender studies, art history, and even economics when you consider how these artists navigate as independent entrepreneurs.
457. Oh yes, umm, some performers invest, right so, [jealous] upwards of ten thousand dollars in their wardrobe, actually! The economics fascinate me because these artists are simultaneously creators, marketers, and business owners managing every aspect of their artistic enterprise.
458. Er, the sense of community was, honestly, beyond anything I expected, sort of like a chosen family! Everyone helps with quick changes, shares makeup tips, and provides emotional support, creating this beautiful ecosystem of mutual aid and artistic collaboration.
459. Next spring, if all goes according to plan with the journal reviews! I'm also hoping to organize a symposium that brings together performers and academics to discuss the intersection of theory and practice.
460. That's exactly my goal, to bridge that gap between academic discourse and lived artistic experience! These performers deserve recognition as the sophisticated artists and cultural commentators they truly are.
461. Well, it's been about, er, eighteen months now since the initial concept, and honestly, the mechanics have evolved dramatically! Started as a simple dice roller but now it's this complex engine-building game with multiple victory paths.
462. Oh absolutely, the thing is, we've run, hmm, over two hundred sessions, and basically each one reveals something new! Last week someone discovered a completely broken combo that let them win in three turns, so we're back to rebalancing the resource economy.
463. Umm, we've thought about it, but here's the thing, our target audience actually wants this complexity, kind of! The hobby gamers we're designing for expect depth and replayability, so stripping features would alienate our core demographic.
464. The artist just, uh, sent mockups that are, [mocking] supposedly final, but honestly they need major revisions, you know! The color palette clashes with our tokens, and the iconography is so tiny that playtesters can't read it from across the table.
465. Yes! Really, that integration is what, umm, makes this design special, like, every action feels thematically appropriate! When you're building your trade empire, the resource conversion mechanics mirror actual historical trade route economics perfectly.
466. That's the plan, though we're scrambling to finish the rulebook and create compelling preview videos! The marketing side is almost more work than the actual game design at this point.
467. Ah, shipping is, basically, our biggest headache right now, sort of! International rates have tripled since we started planning, so we're, hmm, considering regional fulfillment centers to keep costs manageable.
468. Actually, we're in negotiations with them now, but the thing is, their minimum order quantities are, uhh, intimidating! They want us to commit to five thousand units, which means fronting almost forty thousand dollars before the campaign even launches.
469. Right so, the margins are, like, [enunciating every word] incredibly thin, and anyway, one miscalculation can sink your company! But when a game connects with its audience, the community support and creative fulfillment make everything worthwhile.
470. Well, we'll pivot to, umm, direct sales at conventions and, basically, build grassroots support that way! Sometimes slow organic growth creates stronger communities than massive crowdfunding campaigns anyway.
471. Oh, actually, I've been experimenting with, you know, lower temperatures around 250 degrees, and, umm, the flavor profile changes completely! The beans develop these incredible fruity notes instead of the typical nutty undertones, though it takes almost twice as long.
472. That's brilliant! I— I could run parallel batches and document the differences in acidity and sweetness. The tasting notes would be fascinating to compare.
473. Honestly, I think it's the humidity in my kitchen, you know, because chocolate is so sensitive to moisture, and, hmm, even a tiny bit of water can cause the whole batch to turn grainy! I've started running a dehumidifier but the results are still inconsistent.
474. I've been meaning to try that! Adding already-tempered chocolate to help crystallize the batch properly seems way more foolproof than trying to work it on marble.
475. Absolutely, that's— wait, that's probably it! Different origins have wildly different fat contents, and I've been treating them all the same way during tempering.
476. Good point! Mine's digital but I haven't calibrated it in months, and even being off by two degrees can completely ruin the crystal structure during tempering.
477. Right so, I've been avoiding additives, but, honestly, a tiny amount of sunflower lecithin might, uhh, solve the thickness issue without affecting flavor! Professional chocolatiers use it all the time to improve workability.
478. Oh definitely, the thing is, those Madagascar beans are, you know, so much harder than the Ecuador ones, and, basically, they need at least twelve more hours in the melanger! The particle size affects everything from mouthfeel to how well it tempers.
479. I thought they were, but [deep pitch] yesterday I noticed condensation forming when I brought them from the cold storage! That explains why some bars have those ugly white spots on the surface.
480. That makes total sense! Pre-warming would prevent thermal shock, and the cotton polishing would give that professional glossy finish I've been struggling to achieve.
481. [startled] Oh god, you must be, um, [shaking], Sarah's child—I mean, you have her exact eyes and, well, I wasn't expecting anyone else to come today.
482. [gentle] She was my sister and she thought about you, [voice breaking], every single day after she had to give you up because of the cancer diagnosis that came right after you were, [tears falling], born and she knew she wouldn't survive to raise you, [whispering], properly.
483. [urgent] No, sweetheart, you were the most, [passionate], wanted child in the world but she was dying and had no family support except me and I was only, [regretful], sixteen myself back then.
484. [soft] She recorded, um, hundreds of voice messages for you that I, well, [reaching], still have on old cassette tapes in a box, umm, hoping someday you'd want them. [sniffles]
485. [nodding] Every birthday I come here and tell her, [tearful], about how I imagine you're doing—what you might look like now, um, whether you're happy, whether you ever, [wistful], wonder about her, and I mean, [breaking], here you actually are.
486. [bittersweet] She was a kindergarten teacher who painted, [fond], watercolors on weekends.
487. [emotional] There's an entire series of paintings she called, [proud], 'Letters to My Daughter' that she worked on during her chemo sessions when she was too weak to hold you but could still, [voice cracking], hold a brush and imagine your, [whispering], future.
488. [steady] Would you like to, um, see them—I mean, [nervous], they're at my apartment just twenty minutes away if you, well, want to know who she really was.
489. [certain] She loved you completely before you could even, [tender], open your eyes, so yes, she would have loved every single version of you that, [smiling through tears], exists or could have existed.
490. I've been waiting sixteen years to, um, [grateful], share her with someone who actually matters, you know? [exhales deeply]
491. I've been searching these ruins for, [startled], thirty years and never expected to find, [cautious], something still breathing down here.
492. [trembling] Dear god.
493. [quiet] This was supposed to be my last expedition before retiring, [hesitant], but seeing you here makes all those years feel, [thoughtful], somehow incomplete.
494. [gently] I've spent, umm, so many years chasing legends and, [reflective], you know, most explorers never find, [sad], what they're really looking for, anyway.
495. [curious] But you sense something, um, different about me, I mean, don't you?
496. [contemplative] You know, I've been running from something too, [vulnerable], just like you're trapped by something more than, well, these stones.
497. [understanding] Stay with you.
498. [determined] There's an old ritual in my grandfather's journals that might, [hopeful], break these binding stones, though it requires, [nervous], something neither of us might survive.
499. [resolute] Then we'll face whatever comes next together, [emotional], two old souls who've spent too long, [voice breaking], searching for meaning in the wrong places.
500. [tender] Let me sit beside you while we wait for dawn, [comforting], because no creature, beast or human, should face their, [solemn], last sunrise alone. [sighs deeply]
501. So you know exactly what this means, um, the moral weight of, [heavy], keeping this information to yourself versus the, [calculating], practical consequences of reporting it, I mean. [sighs]
502. [stern] Well, um, you've been working here twelve years and, [probing], your daughter just started college with that tuition assistance program, so I mean, [measured], let's think through what happens if you, [careful], become a whistleblower, you know.
503. [guiding] Your mortgage payment is due next week and Sarah's, [pointed], medical bills are still piling up from her surgery.
504. [logical] The last person who reported fraud here was blacklisted from, [clinical], every major employer in the tristate area.
505. [pressing] Um, so you have twenty-four hours to decide whether, [deliberate], you're the person who follows orders or the one who, [sharp], does what's right, I mean, regardless of personal cost, you know.
506. [softer] Well, um, remember when you first started here and promised yourself you'd, [nostalgic], never become one of those people who looks away, you know?
507. [steering] So, um, the anonymous tip line exists for a reason, and well, [strategic], documentation can be leaked without immediately, [cautious], implicating you as the source, you know.
508. [firm] Well, um, you've already made your decision haven't you, I mean, [knowing], sitting here at midnight creating backup copies of everything, [proud], instead of being home with your family, you know.
509. [gentle] Tomorrow morning you'll either be the person who, [encouraging], stood up or the one who stayed silent.
510. Finally you're becoming the person you, [proud], always claimed to be instead of the one who, [relieved], just processes numbers and pretends not to see. [exhales]
511. [eager] My mother always told me that distilling was, [wistful], in our blood somehow, that there was this, [searching], artistry to it she never got to fully, [hopeful], explore before she passed.
512. I'm ready to learn everything from, [determined], the ground up, whatever it takes.
513. She worked at a place called Hartwell Distillery for, [nostalgic], three years before I was born, but there was some kind of, [hesitant], accident and she never went back.
514. Sarah Chen, and, um, she always said the accident wasn't, [defensive], anyone's fault but I could tell she, uh, never really believed that herself.
515. [confused] You knew her then, I mean, really knew her, because, um, the way you just said her name sounds like, [realizing], there's something more here that, uh, you're not telling me.
516. [stunned] So you're the reason she, um, could never look at a still without, [angry], flinching, why she'd wake up screaming about, uh, copper and steam.
517. [bitter] She never told me your name but she said, [accusatory], the person she loved most became the person who, [cracking], destroyed her dreams.
518. [softer] Maybe that's why she sent me here, [understanding], in her own way, through her stories that made me, [tearful], fall in love with this craft. [long pause]
519. [gentle] She forgave you, I think, because, um, she kept your first bottle, the one you made, [emotional], together, hidden in her closet wrapped in that, uh, faded blue ribbon. [sniffles]
520. [resolute] Then maybe it's time we, um, finish what you both, [hopeful], started.
521. [nervous] Your Majesty, I'm here because the strikes are, [measured], spreading faster than your guards can suppress them and the kingdom's, [careful], economy is beginning to collapse. [clears throat]
522. [steady] With respect, executing workers doesn't make the remaining ones, [emphatic], more productive or loyal.
523. [diplomatic] The workers aren't asking for much, just, [earnest], basic safety regulations and one day of rest per week. [sighs quietly]
524. Actually, um, they're dying in the mines at, [grave], three times the rate of neighboring kingdoms, and, well, dead workers can't mine gold or, [pointed], pay taxes, I mean, surely you understand that?
525. [firm] Well, Your Majesty, um, I'm trying to save your empire from, [urgent], crumbling because, you know, even tyrants need living subjects to rule. [pause]
526. [resigned] Kill me then.
527. Fear won't solve your labor crisis or stop the, [blunt], revolution that's already begun.
528. [hopeful] So, um, you'll consider the workers' demands then, I mean, the, [encouraging], basic ones about safety and rest, well, as a starting point for, [careful], negotiations?
529. That's not negotiation.
530. [defeated] Well, um, I'll take your offer back. [sighs]
531. [curious] Well, um, that's definitely not, [suspicious], something I hear every day—I mean, an officer wearing their own product, so, [cautious], let me take a look at this thing. [exhales]
532. [focused] This model was, er, discontinued five years ago because, well, [grim], it kept transmitting even after court orders expired—umm, basically creating permanent surveillance.
533. [discovering] Wait, um, there's something else—this device is, [shocked], broadcasting to two separate frequencies, and, well, one of them isn't, you know, [worried], even registered to law enforcement. [pause]
534. [urgent] I mean, yeah, and, um, whoever's receiving this data has, [disturbed], access to your entire network—er, basically every monitored individual in your, well, caseload.
535. [working] The coordinates are pointing to, umm, an abandoned warehouse on, [confused], Pier 47 but, well, that's where they used to, [remembering], store decommissioned monitoring equipment before the, you know, budget cuts. [whispers]
536. Someone's been, um, building a parallel surveillance network using, [revelation], officers like you as unwitting nodes—I mean, [technical], this code here shows automated collection protocols that, well, [amazed], harvest everything.
537. [grim] Based on what I'm seeing here, um, they don't just, [careful], have your data—they've been using it to, well, [measured], predict probation violations before they happen, you know?
538. [determined] Look, I can disable this thing but, um, whoever's watching will, [warning], know immediately that we've discovered their, [steady], operation—so, err, we need to decide right now if you're ready for whatever comes, well, next.
539. The signal just spiked which means they're, [alarmed], actively monitoring us right now, probably, [frantic], wondering why you're at a repair shop instead of, [urgent], making your scheduled rounds.
540. Alright, um, on three then—just, well, know that once I cut this, [grave], there's no going back to your old life.
541. [nervous] That's just some old equipment we're, [defensive], storing back there, nothing that would interest the FDA or, [forced calm], affect our compliance with health codes whatsoever. [coughs]
542. You really should just focus on the, [threatening], main kitchen area where the actual food preparation happens.
543. [desperate] Well, um, sometimes the pipes make these, [fabricating], weird noises when the compressor kicks in, you know, old building problems that we've been, [sweating], meaning to fix for months.
544. [cold] You have no legal authority to demand, [calculating], anything beyond food safety inspections, and this is, [menacing], private property beyond your jurisdiction.
545. [panicking] She's my daughter and this is a, [breaking], family matter that has nothing to do with your, [pleading], stupid restaurant inspection so please just leave us alone. [voice cracking]
546. You don't understand what she, [angry], did to our family by running away with that monster.
547. [defeated] I just wanted to, um, talk to her, you know, make her understand why she can't throw her life away like this.
548. [broken] I was trying to save her from, [sobbing], making the same mistakes her mother made when she was young, [anguished], before everything fell apart and destroyed our lives completely.
549. [resigned] Here's the key.
550. [hollow] Twenty-six hours. [sighs heavily]
551. [calm] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, your quotas won't matter when they, [urgent], shut this entire floor down next week and, like, replace every operator with the new AI systems they've been, [quiet], secretly installing on level three.
552. [gentle] I know it's, um, hard to accept, but I've seen the termination paperwork already dated for, [heavy], next Friday, well, with your name on it.
553. [improvising] The security guard who let me in has been, [conspiratorial], working with us for weeks because his brother got replaced at the plant in, [passionate], Detroit last month. [pauses]
554. [pressing] You can't what, um, afford to lose this job or, like, you can't afford to, [intense], keep pretending everything's fine while they're, well, literally dismantling your livelihood? [sighs heavily]
555. [soft] That's exactly why we need people like you to, [earnest], help us stop this from happening to more families.
556. [mysterious] We're not chaining ourselves to anything because tomorrow night we're going to, [determined], make these machines produce something completely different that will, [mischievous], cost them millions in recalled products.
557. [steady] Not sabotage, just a small adjustment to the temperature settings that will, [careful], make every part slightly off specification but still look perfect.
558. The robots have, um, already taken your job, you just don't, [sad], know it yet.
559. [fierce] Dignity doesn't, um, pay rent when you're unemployed, I mean, ask the thousand workers from the Cleveland facility who got, [angry], two days notice last month.
560. [triumphant] You were never here anyway, um, just another ghost in the machine that they were, [philosophical], always planning to exorcise, but, well, at least now you'll haunt them back before you, [dark], disappear completely into their profit margins.
561. [hollow] So you're the one who, um, [withering], won the contest back when I still had, well, [bitter], fifteen million people watching my every move, I mean, before everything fell apart. [laughs weakly]
562. [sardonic] Different—that's what they called it before they, [cracking], decided I was problematic and canceled me overnight.
563. [trembling] Um, you don't understand what it's, well, [desperate], like to wake up and see your entire life's work just, [broken], deleted, erased like you never mattered, I mean, like you never existed at all.
564. [exhausted] I, um, used to believe that too, you know, [vacant], before the death threats and the sponsors pulling out and, well, [defeated], my own family saying maybe I should just, um, disappear for a while. [sighs heavily]
565. [surprised] Six hours just to, um, [confused], meet someone who can't even get brand deals for, well, [self-deprecating], teeth whitening strips anymore, I mean, that's either dedication or insanity.
566. I filmed that video, um, [remembering], three years ago when I still believed my own, well, [nostalgic], motivational bullshit, you know.
567. [breaking] Um, I'm sorry.
568. [crying] I haven't felt like I, um, [raw], mattered to anyone in so long that I forgot what it, well, [vulnerable], feels like to hear someone say my work meant, I mean, [choked up], something real.
569. Um, well, thank you.
570. [grateful] Well, maybe, um, losing everything was, you know, [contemplative], worth it to hear that. [cries softly]
571. Um, you've got the wrong person, I mean, my name is, [forced cheerful], Mr. Giggles and I'm just here to make these kids, [desperate], smile, so, uh, if you could just let me finish my show, you know?
572. [defensive] Look, um, whatever you think you know about me, well, that person is, [bitter], dead, okay, so I mean, just leave me alone.
573. The kids are watching us right now and their parents, [panicking], paid good money for this party, so can we at least take this somewhere else?
574. [resigned] You know, um, I used to have people begging to get into my parties, I mean, celebrities would fly in just to be, [hollow], seen at my events, er, and now look at me. [laughs bitterly]
575. [broken] Every night I dream about, [trembling], the old life, the champagne, the music so loud you could, [wistful], feel it in your chest, and then I wake up, [voice cracking], in my van behind a Walmart parking lot. [long pause]
576. [pleading] I was sick, [shaking], okay, I had a problem and I lost, [desperate], control of everything, but I'm clean now, [voice breaking], eight months clean and trying to rebuild. [sobs]
577. [defeated] So what happens now, do you, [terrified], drag me back to Miami where they'll, [choking up], probably make an example of me, or do you just, [barely audible], call them and tell them where I am? [voice cracks]
578. [desperate] I can get the money, um, I mean, not all at once but I've been, [frantic], saving every penny from these parties and, well, I've got almost, [hopeful], five thousand already, and, er, I can get more if you give me time.
579. [cautious] Whatever keeps me breathing and, [exhausted], out of a shallow grave in the Everglades.
580. [grateful] Thank you, um, I mean, really, thank you—I'll make the best, [tearful], damn balloon animals those kids have ever seen, you know?
581. [gasp softly] The data... oh my God, the data is actually showing—I need to run this again. No, wait, I've run it seventeen times already. [very excited] This is it. This is actually it! The redshift patterns, they're not just anomalies, they're... um... they're showing time running backwards in those pockets. [pause] Actual reversed causality. 

I mean, we theorized it could exist but [shaky voice] nobody thought we'd actually find evidence. Twenty-three years I've been staring at these stars and now—Jesus, this changes everything. [laugh] Physics textbooks? Garbage. Our entire understanding of entropy? Wrong. So fundamentally wrong.

[very quietly] What if I've made a mistake? No, no, the math checks out. Hernandez verified it independently, she got the same results from the Chilean observatory. [speeding up] This means the Big Bang wasn't the beginning, it was like, a middle point? A turning point where time split into forward and backward streams and we've only been seeing half the universe this whole time—

[long pause]

My hands won't stop shaking. [emotionally] I'm looking at proof that somewhere out there, effects happen before causes. Death before birth. Endings before beginnings. We're going to have to tell everyone tomorrow. [whisper] Everything they know is only half the story.
582. [shaky voice] They keep telling me I have to do this. That I don't have a choice. Um, like I'm supposed to just walk in there tomorrow and say words that'll—that'll destroy him. [pause] My own brother. [bitter] The prosecutor keeps coaching me, you know? "Just tell the truth," she says. But the truth is that Danny didn't do this, and somehow my testimony is supposed to help convict him anyway. 

I keep thinking about when we were kids and he'd, [crying while speaking] he'd always protect me from everything. Always. [sniffle] And now they want me to sit in that chair and answer their questions about seeing his car that night, about the timing, about—God, I can't. [frustrated] But if I don't testify, they'll charge me with contempt. 

[whispering] I already told them what I saw. I mean, yes, his car was there, but that doesn't mean anything! [angry] There were dozens of cars there! Honestly, how is this even legal? To force someone to testify against family? 

[long pause]

[very sad] Mom can't even look at me. She thinks I'm—I don't know what she thinks. That I'm choosing this? [exhausted] Tomorrow morning, nine o'clock. I'll sit in that witness box and tell the truth, and somehow, [trailing off] somehow that truth is going to cage an innocent man.
583. [very excited] She did it! Maria actually qualified! I can't—I mean, when she first rolled into my workshop two years ago, [pause] her spinal injury was so recent, she could barely hold the bow steady. And um, everyone said adaptive equipment had limits, but I just kept thinking... [passionately] there had to be a way, you know?

The first custom grip I made was a disaster. [laugh] She was so polite about it too, but I could see her struggling. So we tried again. And again. I basically redesigned that release mechanism seventeen times—seventeen! [frustrated] Some nights I wanted to quit, honestly. But then she'd show up at practice, [warm] always early, never complaining even when the prosthetic attachment was digging into her shoulder.

That moment today when her final arrow hit dead center... [gasp softly] I actually couldn't breathe. The qualifier score we needed was 630, and she shot 634. [crying while speaking] Four years people told her she'd never compete again, and I just—we proved them all wrong, didn't we? 

[very quietly] Her mom hugged me afterwards and whispered "thank you for believing in her." But like, [empathetically] how could I not? She never gave up on herself, so neither could I. [long pause] Paralympics, here we come.
584. [curious] Okay so, um, I've been checking meters in this neighborhood for like fifteen years, and honestly, this is—this is weird. [confused] Everyone on Maple Street is getting these insane bills, right? But here's the thing, [whispering] their actual usage readings are totally normal. I mean, Mrs. Henderson showed me her bill—[gasp] three thousand dollars! [frustrated] And she lives alone, barely uses her AC.

[excited] Wait wait wait, I just realized something. So yesterday, er, I was checking the junction box, and there's this—[pause] okay this is going to sound crazy but [speeding up] there's an extra line running from the main that shouldn't even exist. [stern] Someone literally tapped into the neighborhood grid and, you know, basically rewired it so that their usage gets, um, distributed across everyone else's meters.

[angry] I cannot believe—actually no, [laugh] I can totally believe it. [confidently] It's that new mansion at the end of the street, isn't it? The one with the, uh, the massive pool and those ridiculous fountains? [sarcastic] Oh sure, they're "conserving energy." [triumphant] I've got readings that prove everything. [relieved] Finally, we can fix this mess and get everyone's bills sorted.
585. [surprised] Oh my God, Jake? Hey! I—wow, it's been, what, like three weeks since we last talked? [warm] No, no, of course I have time, what's—[pause] wait, you sound different. Better, actually. [curious] Really? The papers went through? Oh man, that's, I mean, finally, right? [relieved] I know how brutal this whole thing has been for you, so that's—[short pause] 

Wait, what? [confused] My support? Jake, honestly, I barely did anything, I just, you know, listened when you needed to vent about, um, all the lawyer stuff and—[emotional] oh. [sniffle] No, you're gonna make me—[shaky voice] I'm really glad I could help, I mean it. [clearing throat] Look, we might not be blood, but you're my brother, okay? And when Dad married your mom, I gained, like, the best stepbrother I could've asked for. [smiling speaking] Remember when we were teenagers and, uh, totally hated each other for like six months? [chuckle] And now here we are, twenty years later and you're calling me first with your news. 

[very sincerely] I'm just—I'm really proud of you for getting through this. Seriously. [warm] You're gonna be okay, Jake. Actually, you're gonna be more than okay.
586. [shaky voice] Three pieces. Three fucking pieces gone while I was eating a goddamn sandwich. The Morimoto, the early Castellani, and—God—the Rothwell that I just, [pause], I literally just acquired last week. Forty-five minutes, that's all I was gone. 

[angry] And now the insurance company is telling me they'll only cover sixty percent because of some bullshit clause about, um, "unattended premises during business hours." Are you kidding me? I mean, I have cameras, I have an alarm system, I have—[frustrated] none of it mattered because whoever did this knew exactly what they were looking for. They walked past everything else and went straight for those three. 

[bitter] Twenty years I've been building this gallery's reputation. Twenty years of relationships with collectors who trusted me to, like, safeguard their investments. [quietly] And now I have to call the Rothwell estate and explain that their grandmother's painting is just... gone. 

The financial hit alone could—[trailing off] I don't even want to calculate it. We're talking, what, eight hundred thousand in lost value after insurance? [sigh] Maybe more. 

[exhausted] I keep replaying it, you know? If I'd just ordered in, if I'd sent my assistant instead, if I'd—but that's pointless. [pause] They're gone. And I have to figure out how the hell to survive this.
587. [warm] So when you said you've been skipping meals to make sure your daughter eats, I just— [pause] Let me pull up your information again. [focused] Because based on what you're telling me, um, you definitely qualify for way more than you think. [excited] Oh my God, wait, you've never applied for WIC? [speeding up] And the childcare assistance program—you could get up to eighty percent covered! That's like, what, six hundred dollars back in your pocket every month?

[empathetically] I see this look on your face, and I get it. [gently] Nobody ever explained this stuff to you, right? [passionate] But listen, these aren't handouts—you've been paying into these systems. [determined] Your daughter qualifies for the free breakfast and lunch program, plus there's actually this emergency fund for, uh, medical expenses that nobody knows about. [very sincerely] When you said you haven't been to the dentist in three years because— [voice breaking] sorry, it just gets me sometimes.

[clearing throat] Look, I'm going to stay late tonight, [confidently] and we're going to fill out every single application together. [hopeful] By next month, you're going to have health coverage, food assistance, childcare help— [emotional] you're going to be able to breathe again. [smiling speaking] Your whole life is about to change, I promise you that.
588. [relieved] God, I can't believe they actually—like, Mark literally came up to me today and said, "You were right." [laugh] Those exact words! After, what, two years of them basically treating me like I was, um, delusional? [bitter] "Too ambitious," they said. "Not realistic." [pause] And now suddenly, [speeding up] now that the numbers are in and the board's actually impressed, everyone's all, you know, "We always knew you had it in you." [sarcastic] Right. Sure you did. [short pause] The thing is, I mean, I'm not even angry anymore. [slowly] Okay, maybe a little angry. But mostly it's just... [sigh] I don't know, kind of surreal? Like, Sarah—Sarah who literally laughed when I presented my initial proposal—[mocking] she asked me to mentor her today. [gasp softly] Can you believe that? Honestly, part of me wanted to say something petty, but [warm] I didn't. Because here's the thing, proving them wrong wasn't even—it wasn't the point anymore. [confidently] I just kept doing the work, you know? Head down, focused, and now... [smiling speaking] now they see what I've always seen. [cheerful] And that feels pretty damn good, actually.
589. Two hundred people. That's, um, that's what keeps hitting me. [very slowly] Not the numbers on the spreadsheet, not the—the profit margins or whatever. [pause] It's the faces, you know? [warm] Like when I walked through that factory floor last week and saw Maria, she's been there, what, thirty-two years? [emotional] And she just grabbed my hands and—[voice breaking] sorry, I'm getting all—[clearing throat] anyway, her kids are in college, right? First generation. [passionately] That would've been gone! All of it!

[anxious] God, I mean, when I first looked at their books, it was like—honestly, it was a disaster. [frustrated] Three generations of, sort of, doing things the same way while everything around them just... [trailing off] But the thing is, [animated] they had all these assets they didn't even realize! The patents alone were—[excited] I actually yelled when I found them! [laugh] 

[very sincerely] You know what though? The old man, Mr. Chen, he, uh, he thanked me yesterday. [slowly] But I keep thinking... [long pause] those families didn't lose their homes because I saw something everyone else missed. [relieved] That's not strategy, that's—I don't know, that's just... [happy] that's everything, isn't it?
590. [shaky voice] God, I can't stop—my hands are still shaking. That little girl, she was, um, trapped under that car and I just... [gasp] I didn't even think, you know? The change just happened. [relieved] And for once, for ONCE it actually meant something. 

[bitter] Six months since anyone would even look at me. Six months since, uh, that party where I—where everyone saw what I really am. [sniffle] Lost my job, lost Sarah, lost basically everything because of this... thing inside me. 

But today, [animated] when I heard her screaming, it's like—I mean, nobody else could lift that car, right? [passionate] The beast just took over and suddenly I'm throwing a two-ton vehicle like it's nothing! [laugh] The same claws that made everyone run away from me, they, er, they cut through her seatbelt like butter.

[very slowly] Her mom looked at me—the real me, all transformed—and she didn't scream. She just... [crying while speaking] she said thank you. Over and over. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

[whispering] Maybe I'm not a monster. [pause] I mean, monsters don't save people, do they? [hopeful] Maybe this curse is actually—I don't know, maybe it's supposed to be here. For moments like this. [very sincerely] For her.
591. [relieved] Oh my God, I just got the email—his claim got approved! [pause] All of it, every single thing we, um, documented. [extremely happy] Marcus is finally going to get his benefits! I mean, honestly, after everything he's been through, it's like—[emotional] sorry, I'm getting a little... [sniffle] The thing is, you know, when I first met him, he could barely, er, even talk about Afghanistan. [empathetically] Three tours, and then he comes home to fight a different kind of battle, right? With the VA system. [frustrated] It's just—it shouldn't be this hard for them, you know? [pause] But anyway, we did it. [warm] All those medical records we tracked down, the, uh, buddy statements from his unit, that neurologist report about his TBI—[cheerful] it all mattered! [laugh] God, I actually started crying when I read the approval letter. Like, literally sitting at my desk just... [trailing off] I mean, this is why I do this job, honestly. [passionately] These veterans, they've given so much, and when the system actually works, when we can actually, um, help them get what they deserve—[very sincerely] there's nothing better than that. Nothing. [happy] I can't wait to call him.
592. [gasp] Oh my God, I—wait, what are you all—[shocked voice] is that a cake? [pause] You guys, I can't—[crying while speaking] oh no, I'm gonna cry, I'm actually gonna cry at work right now. [sniffle] This is, um, this is literally the sweetest thing anyone's ever— [voice breaking] Mrs. Henderson, did you organize this? And Mr. Tony with your, er, your bad hip, you came in on your day off? [laugh] I'm such a mess right now, look at me!

[warm] You know, I was just gonna, like, work my shift and maybe grab takeout later, nothing special. [pause] But this—[very sincerely] you have no idea what this means to me. Moving here, starting over, I mean, the thing is I didn't really know anyone and— [cheerful] oh God, listen to me getting all sappy! [laugh loudly] 

Jake, are you actually filming this? [embarrassed] I look terrible! My mascara's probably, you know, completely ruined. [happy] But honestly? This is—this might be my best birthday ever. [getting emotional] You're not just customers, you're like—[pause] you're my people. My morning people. [delighted] Come here, all of you, group hug behind the counter! I don't even care if corporate sees this!
593. [hesitantly] I got the promotion today. Senior accountant. The exact position Sandra had for, um, twelve years. [pause] They called me into the conference room this morning and I thought—I honestly thought they were going to let me go too. But instead they're giving me her office. [regretful] Her coffee mug is still on the desk, you know? The one with the stupid cat meme that says "I survived another meeting that should've been an email." 

[sigh] She taught me everything. Like, literally everything about forensic auditing, about reading between the lines in financial statements. [sad] And now I'm sitting in her chair making twenty thousand more than she ever did because they "restructured the compensation package." [bitter] That's what they actually said. Restructured.

I mean, I worked hard for this, [quietly] I know I deserve it. But it feels so... [trailing off] She texted me congratulations this morning. Can you believe that? [shaky voice] She's been unemployed for three weeks and she's congratulating me. Said she's proud, said I'll do amazing things. [pause] 

[anxious] Everyone keeps looking at me like I'm some kind of traitor. But what was I supposed to do, right? Turn it down? [frustrated] The mortgage isn't going to pay itself. [very quietly] I just wish it didn't have to happen like this.
594. [bitter] Thirty-two years. Thirty-two years I've been drilling bowling balls in this shop, and now they're just—[pause] I mean, look at that monstrosity across the street. [sarcastic] "Bowl-Mart: Your One-Stop Bowling Superstore." Yeah, real original.

[frustrated] You know what they charge for a drill job? Twenty-nine ninety-nine. Twenty-nine! I can't even buy the bits for that price. [laugh] And people are actually going there, like, [mocking] "Oh wow, such a great deal!" 

[sad] Mrs. Henderson came by yesterday—she's been my customer since '97—and she couldn't even look me in the eye when she said she bought her new ball there. [sigh] Said they threw in free drilling with purchase. Free. How am I supposed to compete with free?

[quietly] My dad started this business. Taught me everything about reading a bowler's hand, um, finding the perfect pitch and span. [warm] Every ball was like a tiny piece of art, you know? Custom fitted, perfectly balanced. [bitter] But apparently nobody cares about craftsmanship anymore when you can get it done by some teenager with a—[trailing off] 

[exhausted] I don't know, maybe it's time to just... [long pause] The lease is up in three months anyway. [resigned] Thirty-two years, and it all ends because of a damn chain store.
595. I can't—I literally can't process this right now. They said yes. They actually, um, they said yes to the film. [gasp softly] Not just yes, but like, they want to premiere it at the festival. The main stage. I mean, honestly, six months ago I had this thing sitting on my hard drive just... collecting dust, you know? [very melancholic] I was so close to deleting the whole project. Like, my finger was literally on the delete button because I thought it was garbage, absolute garbage. And now—[laugh] God, I'm such an idiot—now they're calling it "visionary" and, uh, what was the word... "transcendent." [excited] Me! My weird little experimental thing that everyone said was too strange, too niche, too whatever. Actually, wait, I need to call my mom. [stuttering] She-she never stopped believing in this even when I did. Even when I was like, sobbing at three AM saying I wasted two years of my life. [clearing throat] The thing is, er, I almost didn't even submit it. Like, the deadline was in twenty minutes and I was just sitting there thinking, why bother, right? [extremely happy] But something made me hit send. And here we are. They're flying me out. Business class. They're putting me up in a hotel. [whispering] This is insane. This is completely, utterly insane.
596. [confused] Fifteen years. Fifteen YEARS I've been with this company, and they're sitting me down telling me I—what? Embezzled? [laugh] This has to be some kind of mistake, right? Like, there's no way anyone actually believes... [pause] Oh my God, you're serious. You're actually serious.

[angry] I've never taken a single penny that wasn't mine! Not even—I mean, I don't even expense my coffee runs half the time! And now suddenly there's, what, [sarcastic] mysteriously missing funds that somehow trace back to me? This is insane. [frustrated] Do you know how many weekends I've given up for this place? How many times I've stayed late to fix other people's mistakes?

[shaky voice] My kids know the security guard's name because I've brought them here so many times when I had to work late. [cry] I decorated my office with their drawings, for God's sake. [long pause] 

[bitter] Someone's setting me up. That's the only explanation, because the numbers—they don't lie, right? But neither do I. [very quietly] I thought you all knew me better than this. Fifteen years, and it means nothing? [sigh] I need to call my lawyer. [furious] And when I prove this is wrong, we're going to have a very different conversation.
597. [exhausted] Okay so, um, we've got seventeen hours—no wait, [quickly] sixteen hours now—before the hospital runs out of ventilator filters. I mean, honestly, I haven't slept in... [trailing off] God, when did I last sleep? [short pause] The shipment's stuck in customs and they're telling me, like, standard processing takes forty-eight hours. [frustrated] Forty-eight! We don't have forty-eight hours, we have—[shouting] we have dying patients!

[deep breath] Right, okay, so here's the thing—I found a loophole. [animated] Emergency medical provisions, article seven point three. Basically, if I can get the health minister's signature, we bypass the whole—[relieved] oh thank God, the email just came through. [very quickly] They signed it, they actually signed it!

[anxious] But now, uh, the truck drivers are saying the route's flooded. Of course it is. [bitter] Of course the main highway is underwater during a medical crisis. Wait wait wait, [excited] what about the military base? They have helicopters, right? And technically, this qualifies as, you know, humanitarian aid.

[passionately] Look, I don't care if I have to, er, personally drive these supplies myself. [shaky voice] These are kids in that ICU. Little kids who need—[pause] who need us to figure this out. [confidently] And we will. We always do.
598. [bitter] Look at this place. Penthouse apartment, view of the whole damn city. Twenty million sitting in offshore accounts and, um, nobody to share it with. [laugh] Mom won't even answer my calls anymore. Dad changed his number—can't say I blame him. 

[sarcastic] "We raised you better than this," that's what Mom said last time. Yeah well, [loudly] your better way had me working three jobs just to pay rent! [pause] I did what I had to do. Built an empire from nothing, even if it meant... [trailing off]

[regretful] Sarah won't let me see the kids. My own nieces don't even know I exist. She told them I died—[gasp softly]—can you believe that? Actually told them their uncle is dead rather than explain what I do. 

[angry] They wanted me to be respectable! They wanted me to play by the rules that were rigged against us from the start! [long pause] 

[sad] I've got everything now, you know? Cars, houses, basically anything money can buy. [crying while speaking] But I'd trade it all for one Sunday dinner with them again. Just one more time hearing Dad's stupid jokes, [sniffle] helping Mom in the kitchen...

[resigned] But this is the price. This is what it cost. [quietly] And I guess I knew it would.
599. [bitter] So they finally noticed, huh? Twenty-three years of, um, breaking my back in that warehouse and NOW they give me employee of the month. [laugh] I mean, the timing is just—it's actually hilarious when you think about it. [pause] My supervisor comes up all, like, congratulations on your efficiency metrics, [mocking] "best packer we've ever had," and then literally in the same breath mentions the, uh, the automation meeting next week. [frustrated] Are you kidding me? I've been hitting those numbers for, I don't know, basically forever, and they choose NOW to— [trailing off] 

[sigh] The thing is, I really was proud for about, hmm, thirty seconds? [sad] Before I realized what this actually means. They're documenting how fast I work so they can, you know, program the robots to match it. [angry] I'm literally training my own replacement! [shaky voice] And everyone's pretending like we don't all see it coming. My coworkers are all, er, acting normal but we know— [very quietly] we all know what happens after they "study our techniques."

[exhausted] I guess I should, um, start looking for something else, right? [hesitantly] But what else am I supposed to do? This is all I've— [long pause] 

[whispering] Twenty-three years.
600. [gasp loudly] They're off the list. The—the manatees are officially off the endangered list. [pause] I just, um, I got the email twenty minutes ago and I've read it like, [shaky voice] I've read it fifteen times already. Thirty-two years. That's how long I've been—God, [laugh] when I started, there were barely five hundred left in these waters. 

[crying while speaking] I remember that first survey, you know, counting them one by one, and thinking we were too late. Like, honestly, I thought we were documenting their extinction. [sniffle] But then the protected zones actually worked, and the boat strikes dropped by, what, seventy percent? And the seagrass beds—[excited] oh my God, the seagrass beds came back! 

[slowly] All those nights sleeping on the research boat, er, missing birthdays, missing—[trailing off] well, missing a lot. [laugh loudly] My ex used to say I loved those "sea cows" more than anything else. [pause] Maybe she was right, I mean—[warm] but look at them now. Two thousand individuals. Healthy calves every season. 

[very sincerely] They're going to make it. After everything, they're actually going to make it. [relieved] I think I need to, uh, sit down for a minute. Or maybe [chuckle] go see them. Yeah. I need to go see my manatees.
601. [defensive] Before you scream or call anyone, [quietly], let me explain why I'm here because this isn't, [hesitantly], what it looks like at all.
602. Look, um, I know this seems bad but, [frustrated], I was actually just trying to, well, get to those rare manuscripts in the back vault, you know?
603. [apologetic] Wait, you're living here aren't you—I can see, [surprised], the makeshift bed behind that desk and the, [whispering], hot plate tucked behind those encyclopedias. [pause]
604. [empathetically] No one stays this late with a sleeping bag and, [warm], three weeks of canned goods unless they've lost their place, [softly], just like I lost mine six months ago before turning to this. [sigh]
605. [regretful] The fence promised me enough for those manuscripts to, [desperately], get a fresh start somewhere new.
606. [shocked] You forged historical documents and, [incredulous], displayed them publicly while the real ones are, [anxiously], locked away somewhere else entirely?
607. [defeated] This whole night has been one, [exhausted], massive mistake and now you're probably going to, [worried], call the police on me anyway.
608. [suspicious] Why would you let me walk away when I just, [nervously], tried to rob the place you're secretly living in? [long pause]
609. You're suggesting what exactly—that I should, [skeptical], trust a librarian who forges documents and, [cautiously], lives illegally in a public building?
610. [contemplative] The night janitor position just opened up here and, [slowly], they don't do background checks for custodial staff, [meaningfully], plus it comes with a legitimate key to the building.
611. [defiant] Well, um, these creatures deserve freedom, not, [passionately], living their entire lives in concrete tanks while you, er, [frustrated], play god with their genetics, you know?
612. [hesitantly] I mean, uh, keeping them captive can't be the answer when, [confused], nature has its own ways of healing and, like, [quietly], maybe we should trust that process, you know?
613. [whispering] Um, I didn't, er, know that.
614. Well, um, every animal I've rescued wanted freedom more than, [sad], safety, and I thought these fish would, uh, [regretful], feel the same way, but maybe I was, like, [trailing off], projecting my own beliefs onto them.
615. [apologetic] Well, um, I just, er, couldn't stand it.
616. [anxious] The way they circle endlessly in those tanks like, [very quietly], prisoners counting days they'll never get back, and seeing their eyes, [crying while speaking], always searching for something that isn't there anymore. [sniffle]
617. But surely, I mean, their instincts must tell them, [hopeful], there's something more beyond these walls, er, [speeding up], some genetic memory of rivers and currents, you know? [gasp softly]
618. [excited] Then you understand why keeping them here feels, [melancholic], fundamentally wrong to someone like me.
619. [softly] Well, um, maybe we could work together somehow, like, [hopefully], combining your scientific knowledge with, uh, [friendly], my field experience to create something better than either of us imagined, you know?
620. [determined] Then let me help you do it right by, [earnest], teaching me what these fish really need instead of, [pleading], what I assume they want based on my rescue work. [soft laugh]
621. [confused] I thought you said she wasn't playing anymore when you called, [hesitantly], but I can hear Rachmaninoff coming through the ceiling right now, [quietly], beautifully actually. [long pause]
622. [empathetically] That's the fourth time in two years she's returned home, [frustrated], each time with the piano more damaged than before from her, [anxious], explosive practice sessions when things don't go, [slowly], perfectly.
623. [stern] Um, actually, I mean—[trailing off]
624. [very sincerely] Mrs. Chen, I've been tuning this Steinway for fifteen years and watching it, [upset], absorb her rage every time she fails has been, [very quietly], heartbreaking for both the instrument and, [whispering], probably for her too.
625. [monotone] Well, um, the hammers are completely worn down from her, I mean, aggressive playing, [apologetic], the soundboard has a new crack from last month's incident, and, like, [exhausted], I can't keep pretending these repairs are normal maintenance anymore.
626. [firmly] I've watched dozens of young pianists burn out because nobody told them, [regretful], the difference between passion and self-destruction, and your daughter is, [trembling], racing toward a cliff you keep pretending isn't there.
627. She needs honesty. [cough]
628. [resigned] I'll tune it. [deep sigh]
629. [sad] Um, pianos don't endure, Mrs. Chen, they, well, break. [groan]
630. [very melancholic] One day you'll sit in this room listening to silence where music, [crying while speaking], used to live and wonder if enabling her pain was really, [bitterly], love after all, [very slowly], but it will be too late.
631. [warm] Hey there sweetheart, it's okay, I can see you're, [empathetically], scared but we're going to find your mommy together right now.
632. [gently] I understand completely, and, um, you know what, [playful], I'm really good at finding people because, well, [confidently], that's actually part of my job, like finding lost things and helping people. [chuckle]
633. [cheerful] Exactly right!
634. Mommies never forget their babies, especially, [passionately], wonderful brave ones like you who are being so, [very sincerely], strong right now even though this is scary.
635. [animated] Even better!
636. [delighted] That's, um, such a sweet thing to say, and, well, I bet your mommy taught you, [proudly], lots of smart things about staying safe.
637. Emma Rose Martinez is such a, [enthusiastically], beautiful name and you did exactly the right thing talking to me.
638. [softly] Of course sweetie.
639. That sounds like the perfect place to, [encouragingly], start our search and we'll check every water fountain in this building.
640. [very sincerely] I promise, and, you know, um, I actually just spent all morning, [determined], fighting for kids just like you, so, well, [emotionally], there's nowhere else I'd rather be than helping you find your mommy.
