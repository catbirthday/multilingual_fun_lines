I mean, honestly, six months ago I had this thing sitting on my hard drive just... collecting dust, you know? [very melancholic] I was so close to deleting the whole project. Like, my finger was literally on the delete button because I thought it was garbage, absolute garbage. And now—[laugh] God, I'm such an idiot—now they're calling it \"visionary\" and, uh, what was the word... \"transcendent.\" [excited] Me! My weird little experimental thing that everyone said was too strange, too niche, too whatever. Actually, wait, I need to call my mom. [stuttering] She-she never stopped believing in this even when I did. Even when I was like, sobbing at three AM saying I wasted two years of my life. [clearing throat] The thing is, er, I almost didn't even submit it. Like, the deadline was in twenty minutes and I was just sitting there thinking, why bother, right? [extremely happy] But something made me hit send. And here we are. They're flying me out. Business class. They're putting me up in a hotel. [whispering] This is insane. This is completely, utterly insane."
