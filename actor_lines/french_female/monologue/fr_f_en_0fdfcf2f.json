I should call Mom. She's been— she's been so worried about me burning through my savings. [pause] Four months. Four months of rejections and \"interesting concept but not for us\" and \"come back when you have more traction.\" [very sincerely] I was starting to think maybe I was delusional, you know? Maybe everyone was right and this was just some pipe dream. [laugh loudly] But here we are! We're actually going to build this thing. We're going to— [trailing off] oh man, we're going to need to hire people. Like, real people. With salaries. [anxious] That's, uh... that's terrifying actually. [confident] No, you know what?
