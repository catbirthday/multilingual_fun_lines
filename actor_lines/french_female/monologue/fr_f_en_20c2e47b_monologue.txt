Speaker [en]: [relieved] God, I can't believe they actually—like, Mark literally came up to me today and said, "You were right." [laugh] Those exact words! After, what, two years of them basically treating me like I was, um, delusional? [bitter] "Too ambitious," they said. "Not realistic." [pause] And now suddenly, [speeding up] now that the numbers are in and the board's actually impressed, everyone's all, you know, "We always knew you had it in you." [sarcastic] Right. Sure you did. [short pause] The thing is, I mean, I'm not even angry anymore. [slowly] Okay, maybe a little angry. But mostly it's just... [sigh] I don't know, kind of surreal? Like, Sarah—Sarah who literally laughed when I presented my initial proposal—[mocking] she asked me to mentor her today. [gasp softly] Can you believe that? Honestly, part of me wanted to say something petty, but [warm] I didn't. Because here's the thing, proving them wrong wasn't even—it wasn't the point anymore. [confidently] I just kept doing the work, you know? Head down, focused, and now... [smiling speaking] now they see what I've always seen. [cheerful] And that feels pretty damn good, actually.
