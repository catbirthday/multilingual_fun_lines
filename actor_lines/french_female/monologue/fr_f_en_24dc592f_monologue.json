Six months since, uh, that party where I—where everyone saw what I really am.

[passionate] The beast just took over and suddenly I'm throwing a two-ton vehicle like it's nothing! [laugh] The same claws that made everyone run away from me, they, er, they cut through her seatbelt like butter.\n\n[very slowly] Her mom looked at me—the real me, all transformed—and she didn't scream. She just... [crying while speaking] she said thank you. Over and over. Thank you, thank you, thank you. \n\n[whispering] Maybe I'm not a monster. [pause] I mean, monsters don't save people, do they? [hopeful] Maybe this curse is actually—I don't know, maybe it's supposed to be here. For moments like this. [very sincerely] For her."
