Speaker [en]: [confused] Fifteen years. Fifteen YEARS I've been with this company, and they're sitting me down telling me I—what? Embezzled? [laugh] This has to be some kind of mistake, right? Like, there's no way anyone actually believes... [pause] Oh my God, you're serious. You're actually serious.

[angry] I've never taken a single penny that wasn't mine! Not even—I mean, I don't even expense my coffee runs half the time! And now suddenly there's, what, [sarcastic] mysteriously missing funds that somehow trace back to me? This is insane. [frustrated] Do you know how many weekends I've given up for this place? How many times I've stayed late to fix other people's mistakes?

[shaky voice] My kids know the security guard's name because I've brought them here so many times when I had to work late. [cry] I decorated my office with their drawings, for God's sake. [long pause] 

[bitter] Someone's setting me up. That's the only explanation, because the numbers—they don't lie, right? But neither do I. [very quietly] I thought you all knew me better than this. Fifteen years, and it means nothing? [sigh] I need to call my lawyer. [furious] And when I prove this is wrong, we're going to have a very different conversation.
