[sniffle] This is, um, this is literally the sweetest thing anyone's ever— [voice breaking] Mrs. Henderson, did you organize this? And Mr. Tony with your, er, your bad hip, you came in on your day off? [laugh] I'm such a mess right now, look at me!\n\n[warm] You know, I was just gonna, like, work my shift and maybe grab takeout later, nothing special. [pause] But this—[very sincerely] you have no idea what this means to me. Moving here, starting over, I mean, the thing is I didn't really know anyone and— [cheerful] oh God, listen to me getting all sappy! [laugh loudly] \n\nJake, are you actually filming this? [embarrassed] I look terrible! My mascara's probably, you know, completely ruined. [happy] But honestly? This is—this might be my best birthday ever. [getting emotional] You're not just customers, you're like—[pause] you're my people. My morning people. [delighted] Come here, all of you, group hug behind the counter!
