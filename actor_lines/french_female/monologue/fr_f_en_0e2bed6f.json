You're shaking—that's okay. Most people do. [pause] Listen, I'm going to be right there in that courtroom, just a few feet away. You see where I stand? Right between you and them. That's not an accident. [warm] That's by design. I've watched hundreds of people sit in that chair, terrified they couldn't do it. And you know what? They did. [slowly] Because here's the thing—you already survived the worst part. This? This is just telling the truth about it. And the truth, it's... it's already yours. Nobody can take that from you. [confidently] When you're up there, you don't have to look at them. Look at the prosecutor, look at the judge, hell, look at me if you need to. [sigh] I've seen people find their voice in that moment when they thought they had nothing left. And afterwards? [pause] They walk out different. Lighter somehow. Like they finally set something down they'd been carrying too long. [very sincerely] You're stronger than you know. I can already see it."
