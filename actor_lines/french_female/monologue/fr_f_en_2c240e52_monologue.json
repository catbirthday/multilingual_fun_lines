That's how long I've been—God, [laugh] when I started, there were barely five hundred left in these waters. \n\n[crying while speaking] I remember that first survey, you know, counting them one by one, and thinking we were too late. Like, honestly, I thought we were documenting their extinction. [sniffle] But then the protected zones actually worked, and the boat strikes dropped by, what, seventy percent? And the seagrass beds—[excited] oh my God, the seagrass beds came back! \n\n[slowly] All those nights sleeping on the research boat, er, missing birthdays, missing—[trailing off] well, missing a lot. [laugh loudly] My ex used to say I loved those \"sea cows\" more than anything else. [pause] Maybe she was right, I mean—[warm] but look at them now. Two thousand individuals. Healthy calves every season. \n\n[very sincerely] They're going to make it. After everything, they're actually going to make it. [relieved] I think I need to, uh, sit down for a minute. Or maybe [chuckle] go see them. Yeah. I need to go see my manatees."
