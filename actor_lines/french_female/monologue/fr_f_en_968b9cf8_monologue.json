Everyone thinks, oh, he must be so wise about death, you know? [laugh] The gravedigger who understands loss! [frustrated] Except I don't—I really, really don't. \n\n[shaky voice] I give families these perfect words about, er, healing and time and acceptance. [angry] And then I go home to her empty chair and I can't—[pause]—I literally cannot process that she's in the ground I know so well. [very sad] The earth doesn't feel gentle. It feels like, um, like theft. [whispering] Sometimes I think I've buried my ability to grieve along with everyone else's dead. [bitter] Funny how that works, isn't it?"
