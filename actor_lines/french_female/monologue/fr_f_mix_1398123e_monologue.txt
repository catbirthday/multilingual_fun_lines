Speaker [mix]: [shaky voice] Ils arrêtent pas de me dire que je dois faire ça. Que j'ai pas le choix. Euh, genre je suis censée entrer là-dedans demain et dire des mots qui vont—qui vont le détruire. [pause] Mon propre frère. [bitter] La procureure continue de me coacher, tu sais? "Just tell the truth," elle dit. Mais la vérité c'est que Danny a rien fait de ça, and somehow my testimony is supposed to help convict him anyway.

Je continue de penser à quand on était petits et il me, [crying while speaking] il me protégeait toujours de tout. Toujours. [sniffle] Et maintenant ils veulent que je m'assoie dans cette chaise et que je réponde à leurs questions sur le fait d'avoir vu sa voiture ce soir-là, sur le timing, sur—Mon Dieu, je peux pas. [frustrated] But if I don't testify, they'll charge me with contempt.

[whispering] Je leur ai déjà dit ce que j'ai vu. Je veux dire, oui, sa voiture était là, mais ça veut rien dire! [angry] Il y avait des dizaines de voitures là-bas! Honestly, how is this even legal? Forcer quelqu'un à témoigner contre sa famille?

[long pause]

[very sad] Maman peut même plus me regarder. Elle pense que je suis—je sais pas ce qu'elle pense. Que je choisis ça? [exhausted] Demain matin, 9 heures. Je vais m'asseoir dans ce box de témoins et dire la vérité, et d'une manière ou d'une autre, [trailing off] somehow that truth is going to cage an innocent man.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] They keep telling me I have to do this. That I don't have a choice. Um, like I'm supposed to just walk in there tomorrow and say words that'll—that'll destroy him. [pause] My own brother. [bitter] The prosecutor keeps coaching me, you know? "Just tell the truth," she says. But the truth is that Danny didn't do this, and somehow my testimony is supposed to help convict him anyway. 

I keep thinking about when we were kids and he'd, [crying while speaking] he'd always protect me from everything. Always. [sniffle] And now they want me to sit in that chair and answer their questions about seeing his car that night, about the timing, about—God, I can't. [frustrated] But if I don't testify, they'll charge me with contempt. 

[whispering] I already told them what I saw. I mean, yes, his car was there, but that doesn't mean anything! [angry] There were dozens of cars there! Honestly, how is this even legal? To force someone to testify against family? 

[long pause]

[very sad] Mom can't even look at me. She thinks I'm—I don't know what she thinks. That I'm choosing this? [exhausted] Tomorrow morning, nine o'clock. I'll sit in that witness box and tell the truth, and somehow, [trailing off] somehow that truth is going to cage an innocent man.
