Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] God, I can't stop—my hands are still shaking. That little girl, she was, um, trapped under that car and I just... [gasp] I didn't even think, you know? The change just happened. [relieved] And for once, for ONCE it actually meant something. 

[bitter] Six months since anyone would even look at me. Six months since, uh, that party where I—where everyone saw what I really am. [sniffle] Lost my job, lost Sarah, lost basically everything because of this... thing inside me. 

But today, [animated] when I heard her screaming, it's like—I mean, nobody else could lift that car, right? [passionate] The beast just took over and suddenly I'm throwing a two-ton vehicle like it's nothing! [laugh] The same claws that made everyone run away from me, they, er, they cut through her seatbelt like butter.

[very slowly] Her mom looked at me—the real me, all transformed—and she didn't scream. She just... [crying while speaking] she said thank you. Over and over. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

[whispering] Maybe I'm not a monster. [pause] I mean, monsters don't save people, do they? [hopeful] Maybe this curse is actually—I don't know, maybe it's supposed to be here. For moments like this. [very sincerely] For her.
