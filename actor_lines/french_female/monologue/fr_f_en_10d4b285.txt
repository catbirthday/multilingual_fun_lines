Subject: Your shy grocery bagger trainee just confidently helped a customer find exactly what they needed

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [gasp softly] Did Marcus just— wait, is that Marcus talking to that customer? [excited] Oh my God, he's actually doing it! He's not looking at his shoes, he's not mumbling, he's— [pause] wow, he's really explaining where the gluten-free section is. [warmly] Look at him using his hands to point, making actual eye contact. This is the kid who literally hid behind the paper bag display last week when someone asked him a question. [chuckle] And now he's walking her over there himself? [very sincerely] I'm so proud of him right now. You know, I was starting to worry that maybe, um... maybe this job wasn't the right fit for him. [relieved] But seeing this? He just needed time to find his confidence. [laugh] Oh, and he's recommending the rice crackers! He remembered what I told him about those being popular. [trailing off] The customer's smiling, she's thanking him, and— [gasp] did he just make a joke? [delighted] Marcus made a joke! About the price of organic food! [happy] She's laughing! This is amazing. [pause] You know what, I'm gonna tell the manager about this. Marcus deserves to know we noticed. [empathetically] Everyone needs that moment when they realize they can actually do the thing that scares them.
