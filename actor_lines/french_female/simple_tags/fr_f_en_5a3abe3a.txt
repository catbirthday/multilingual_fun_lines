=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] She's been through a lot this year and, [protective], this is her first time in a real salon, so please be, [gentle], patient with her because she's still learning to trust people again.

Character 2 [en]: [frozen] Oh my God, um, I mean, is that—I can't believe it's, [shaky voice], actually her after all these years, like, [whispering], I never thought I'd see her again, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Wait, um, do you two know each other somehow because she's, [confused], looking at you like she's seen a ghost or something, I mean, what's happening here?

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] I, uh, I used to know her, like, a really long time ago before, [trailing off], before everything changed...

Character 1 [en]: Look, er, whatever history you have with her, I mean, [stern], she's fragile right now and, [firmly], I won't let anyone hurt her again, not after everything she's been through, you know? [protective stance]

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] She's my sister.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Your sister—but, um, she said her siblings were all, [quietly], gone or dead, I mean, where have you been all this time, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I ran away from the foster system when I turned eighteen and, [bitter], left her behind because I couldn't take it anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [angrily] You left a twelve-year-old alone in that system while you, [accusatory], saved yourself, and now you're just, [disgusted], standing here cutting hair like nothing happened?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I tried to go back for her but they'd already, [voice breaking], moved her to another home and wouldn't tell me where because I wasn't, [defeated], her legal guardian anymore. [sobs]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Listen, um, I didn't know the whole story, but she's been, [gently], self-harming and cutting her own hair for years, like, refusing to let anyone touch her, you know?

Character 2 [en]: She used to let me braid her hair every night before, [nostalgic], bed when we were kids.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, maybe that's why she finally agreed to come here today, like, [thoughtful], maybe somehow she knew or sensed you'd be here, I mean, [hopeful], maybe this is her way of reaching out, you know? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] Can I please just try to, [desperate], talk to her and explain everything?

Character 1 [en]: That's her choice. [firm]

Character 2 [en]: [nervously] I know, um, I have no right to ask for forgiveness after, well, [ashamed], abandoning her like that, you know? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] She's been in therapy for two years and we've worked, [proudly], so hard to get her to this point where she can even, [warmly], leave the house, so please don't undo all that progress. [protective]

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] I've been saving money for three years to, [determined], hire a private investigator to find her and make things right somehow.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Well she's here now and she needs, [compassionate], both of us to be strong for her, not fall apart with our own, [wise], guilt and regrets, because this moment is about her healing. [resolute]

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Thank you for taking care of her when I, [remorseful], couldn't, for being the guardian she needed when her own, [emotional], family failed her so completely.
