Scenario: A hatchery manager discovers a rescuer releasing endangered fish fingerlings from their facility into the wild, believing they're saving them from captivity.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Stop right there, you're releasing, [angry], our entire breeding stock of endangered sturgeon that took, [shaky voice], five years to cultivate and you have no idea what you're doing! [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [defiant] Well, um, these creatures deserve freedom, not, [passionately], living their entire lives in concrete tanks while you, er, [frustrated], play god with their genetics, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Those concrete tanks are the only reason, [bitter], this species still exists after the dam construction wiped out, [trembling], ninety percent of their natural spawning grounds twenty years ago.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] I mean, uh, keeping them captive can't be the answer when, [confused], nature has its own ways of healing and, like, [quietly], maybe we should trust that process, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Nature doesn't heal when we've destroyed the entire river system with, [pause], industrial runoff and hydroelectric projects. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Um, I didn't, er, know that.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Please, just listen.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, every animal I've rescued wanted freedom more than, [sad], safety, and I thought these fish would, uh, [regretful], feel the same way, but maybe I was, like, [trailing off], projecting my own beliefs onto them.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Look, I mean, I understand your heart is, [gently], in the right place because, um, [sincere], anyone who cares this much about animals can't be all wrong. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Well, um, I just, er, couldn't stand it.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Um, couldn't stand, well, what exactly?

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] The way they circle endlessly in those tanks like, [very quietly], prisoners counting days they'll never get back, and seeing their eyes, [crying while speaking], always searching for something that isn't there anymore. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [kindly] Every single fish you're seeing was born here, [long pause], never knew the wild you're imagining for them.

Character 2 [en]: But surely, I mean, their instincts must tell them, [hopeful], there's something more beyond these walls, er, [speeding up], some genetic memory of rivers and currents, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] Actually, um, you're not entirely wrong about that because, well, [animated], we've documented fascinating migration behaviors even in tenth-generation captive-bred specimens. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Then you understand why keeping them here feels, [melancholic], fundamentally wrong to someone like me.

Character 1 [en]: [passionate] What feels wrong is watching a species disappear forever while, [stern], people argue about philosophy instead of taking, [quickly], practical action to save them.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Well, um, maybe we could work together somehow, like, [hopefully], combining your scientific knowledge with, uh, [friendly], my field experience to create something better than either of us imagined, you know?

Character 1 [en]: You just tried to sabotage five years of conservation work, but, [considering], there's something about your passion that reminds me why, [nostalgic], I started this work in the first place. [deep sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Then let me help you do it right by, [earnest], teaching me what these fish really need instead of, [pleading], what I assume they want based on my rescue work. [soft laugh]
