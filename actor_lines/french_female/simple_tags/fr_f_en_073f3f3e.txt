=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, she's upstairs. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [confused] I thought you said she wasn't playing anymore when you called, [hesitantly], but I can hear Rachmaninoff coming through the ceiling right now, [quietly], beautifully actually. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] She came back from New York three days ago after another, [bitter], setback with her management dropping her because of, [shaky voice], what they called reliability issues.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] That's the fourth time in two years she's returned home, [frustrated], each time with the piano more damaged than before from her, [anxious], explosive practice sessions when things don't go, [slowly], perfectly.

Character 1 [en]: [accepting] It's just her process. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Um, actually, I mean—[trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [offering] Look, um, I know what you're thinking but, well, she needs this piano to be perfect right now, [passionately], it's the only thing keeping her grounded while she figures out her next move, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Mrs. Chen, I've been tuning this Steinway for fifteen years and watching it, [upset], absorb her rage every time she fails has been, [very quietly], heartbreaking for both the instrument and, [whispering], probably for her too.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] She's not failing, she's just experiencing temporary setbacks that any artist, [quickly], faces when they're pursuing something extraordinary and I'm helping her, [excited], stay focused on the bigger picture here. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] Well, um, the hammers are completely worn down from her, I mean, aggressive playing, [apologetic], the soundboard has a new crack from last month's incident, and, like, [exhausted], I can't keep pretending these repairs are normal maintenance anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe if you understood what she's been through with those, [angry], vultures in the industry who promised her everything then—

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] I've watched dozens of young pianists burn out because nobody told them, [regretful], the difference between passion and self-destruction, and your daughter is, [trembling], racing toward a cliff you keep pretending isn't there.

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] Well, um, I appreciate your concern but, like, she's my daughter and I know what she needs. [nervous laugh]

Character 2 [en]: She needs honesty. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Can you please just tune the piano so she can prepare for her next audition, [hopefully], the one in Chicago that could change everything if she just gets another chance? [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] I'll tune it. [deep sigh]

Character 1 [en]: The piano has survived everything she's thrown at it because, [proudly], just like her mother, it knows how to endure and, [cheerful], support her through the storms.

Character 2 [en]: [sad] Um, pianos don't endure, Mrs. Chen, they, well, break. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering loudly] Er, um, maybe they do.

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] One day you'll sit in this room listening to silence where music, [crying while speaking], used to live and wonder if enabling her pain was really, [bitterly], love after all, [very slowly], but it will be too late.
