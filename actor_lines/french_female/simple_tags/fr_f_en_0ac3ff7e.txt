=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I have this photograph from 1973, before we had to leave, and it shows my grandmother wearing a pendant that I'd like you to recreate. [pause] The metal work looks intricate, almost like lace, but made from iron.

Character 2 [en]: Iron lace work? That's old style.

Character 1 [en]: My family had to leave everything behind when the government changed, and this pendant [sighs] it was supposedly made by someone in your grandfather's generation, maybe even your grandfather himself.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] You've been gone what, forty years? [quietly] The techniques you're describing, they're mostly forgotten now, replaced by machines and mass production.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Forty-two years in London, watching this country from news reports and wondering if the streets still smell like jasmine in spring. [very quietly] They don't, by the way.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] The jasmine got pulled out fifteen years ago for parking lots. [pause] But I still know the old techniques because my grandfather taught them to me before he died, said someone might need them someday.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] He said that? [warmly] My grandmother used to say the pendant would protect whoever wore it, that the pattern itself was a kind of prayer worked into metal.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Those weren't just stories, you know. [slowly] Each loop and curve in traditional iron lace has meaning, and your grandmother's pendant, if it's what I think it is, was probably a marriage blessing.

Character 1 [en]: A marriage blessing.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] The photograph shows three interlocking circles with a flame pattern inside, right? That's definitely a marriage blessing, meant to be passed from mother to daughter on their wedding day.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] I never got married because I was waiting to come back here first, waiting to feel like I belonged somewhere enough to start a family. [laughs bitterly] Forty-two years of waiting.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] You belong here enough to seek out the old crafts, to remember what mattered to your grandmother. [pause] That's more than most people who never left can say.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] The thing is, I don't even speak the language properly anymore, my accent gives me away every time I open my mouth, and people look at me like I'm a tourist in my own birthplace.

Character 2 [en]: Your grandmother's pendant will know you.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What do you mean?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] When I forge it using the old methods, heating and folding the iron seven times while speaking the traditional words, it'll carry the same blessing as the original. [very sincerely] Metal has memory, especially when it's shaped with intention.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You'll really do this for me? [emotionally] I've asked three other blacksmiths and they all said it was impossible, that the techniques were lost.

Character 2 [en]: [proudly] They were lost to people who thought progress meant forgetting. [warmly] My grandfather would haunt me if I didn't help you reclaim this piece of your family's history.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I brought soil from my grandmother's grave in London to mix with the coal for the forge fire, if that's not too strange to ask. [pause] She never got to come home either.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] That's not strange at all, that's exactly right. [softly] We'll bring her home through the fire and the iron, and when you wear that pendant, you'll carry both your places with you.
