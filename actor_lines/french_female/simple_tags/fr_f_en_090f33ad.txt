=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Where's, [crying while speaking], my mommy?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Hey there sweetheart, it's okay, I can see you're, [empathetically], scared but we're going to find your mommy together right now.

Character 1 [en]: She was here and then, um, [shaky voice], she wasn't here and I looked everywhere and, well, [sniffling], the big room has too many people and, you know, [very quietly], I can't see her anywhere.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I understand completely, and, um, you know what, [playful], I'm really good at finding people because, well, [confidently], that's actually part of my job, like finding lost things and helping people. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] You help find mommies who get, [confused], lost in the big building with all the, [anxious], scary doors that make loud sounds? [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [cheerful] Exactly right!

Character 1 [en]: [child-like] But, um, what if she, like, [worried], went home without me or, you know, [trembling], forgot I was here because, well, sometimes grownups forget important things.

Character 2 [en]: Mommies never forget their babies, especially, [passionately], wonderful brave ones like you who are being so, [very sincerely], strong right now even though this is scary.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Are you, um, like a police person but, well, [excited], without the shiny badge and, you know, [speeding up], the hat that my friend Tommy's dad wears?

Character 2 [en]: [animated] Even better!

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] My mommy says there are good people who, [friendly], help kids when they need it and you have, [happy], nice eyes like the lady at my school.

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] That's, um, such a sweet thing to say, and, well, I bet your mommy taught you, [proudly], lots of smart things about staying safe.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] She told me if I get lost to find someone who, [carefully], looks like they work here and tell them, [loudly], my whole name which is Emma Rose Martinez. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Emma Rose Martinez is such a, [enthusiastically], beautiful name and you did exactly the right thing talking to me.

Character 1 [en]: [shy] Will you hold my hand while we, [nervously], look for her because my legs feel wobbly? [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Of course sweetie.

Character 1 [en]: [hopefully] Maybe she's by the water fountain because she, [giggling], always gets thirsty after we go places and she, [very excited], lets me push the button to make the water come out. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: That sounds like the perfect place to, [encouragingly], start our search and we'll check every water fountain in this building.

Character 1 [en]: [trusting] You promise you won't leave me alone until we, [quietly], find her?

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] I promise, and, you know, um, I actually just spent all morning, [determined], fighting for kids just like you, so, well, [emotionally], there's nowhere else I'd rather be than helping you find your mommy.
