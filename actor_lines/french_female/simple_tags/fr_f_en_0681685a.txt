=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Um, uh, what—err, who?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Before you scream or call anyone, [quietly], let me explain why I'm here because this isn't, [hesitantly], what it looks like at all.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Well, um, you're clearly breaking in here with, [shaky voice], what looks like professional tools, so, uh, I mean how is this not exactly what it looks like? [nervous laugh]

Character 2 [en]: Look, um, I know this seems bad but, [frustrated], I was actually just trying to, well, get to those rare manuscripts in the back vault, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [stern] You can't just break into a library, [angry], even if you're desperate for money because those manuscripts, [trembling], are priceless historical artifacts that belong to, [passionately], this entire community.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Wait, you're living here aren't you—I can see, [surprised], the makeshift bed behind that desk and the, [whispering], hot plate tucked behind those encyclopedias. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [embarrassed] That's, um, completely different because I work here and, [very quietly], sometimes I just, well, stay late to catch up on cataloging, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] No one stays this late with a sleeping bag and, [warm], three weeks of canned goods unless they've lost their place, [softly], just like I lost mine six months ago before turning to this. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] So, um, what, we're supposed to bond over being, [sad], homeless now, I mean, while you're literally trying to steal from the only place I have left? [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] The fence promised me enough for those manuscripts to, [desperately], get a fresh start somewhere new.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] You realize those particular manuscripts are, [thoughtful], actually brilliant forgeries I created to protect the real ones, which are, [proudly], safely hidden in a climate-controlled vault that even I don't have the key to.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You forged historical documents and, [incredulous], displayed them publicly while the real ones are, [anxiously], locked away somewhere else entirely?

Character 1 [en]: [mocking] Brilliant thief.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] This whole night has been one, [exhausted], massive mistake and now you're probably going to, [worried], call the police on me anyway.

Character 1 [en]: The security cameras have been broken for, [whispering loudly], three months which is how you got in so easily, [relieved], but also means there's no evidence you were ever here.

Character 2 [en]: [suspicious] Why would you let me walk away when I just, [nervously], tried to rob the place you're secretly living in? [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] Because, um, I know what desperation feels like and, [gently], maybe we can figure out something better than, er, you know, stealing fake manuscripts that wouldn't have helped you anyway.

Character 2 [en]: You're suggesting what exactly—that I should, [skeptical], trust a librarian who forges documents and, [cautiously], lives illegally in a public building?

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, um, I'm suggesting that maybe two people who've, [hopeful], hit rock bottom might be able to, er, help each other climb back up, you know? [clearing throat]

Character 2 [en]: [contemplative] The night janitor position just opened up here and, [slowly], they don't do background checks for custodial staff, [meaningfully], plus it comes with a legitimate key to the building.
