=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] I never thought I'd see this town again, [shaky voice], let alone someone who might actually remember me after all these years.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] You probably don't recognize me since I was only eight when you, [hesitantly], left with nothing but that old guitar case. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Wait, um, you're Sarah's daughter—I mean, you're the little girl who, well, used to sit on the porch steps listening to me, er, practice those old folk songs every evening.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] Yeah, um, I'm Emma and, [crying while speaking], you were the only adult who ever really listened when I talked about, like, my dreams of becoming a writer, you know. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: Your mother and I had our differences but you were always, [regretful], this bright light in that house that made everything bearable.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Mom never understood why I kept asking about you, um, where you went or, [frustrated], if you ever thought about us—well, about me—after you disappeared one night without, [very sad], even saying goodbye, you know. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Leaving without a proper goodbye was the most, [anxious], cowardly thing I've ever done but staying would have meant, [whispering], watching your mother marry someone else while I, [slowly], withered away in that small town.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] I kept that notebook you gave me, um, the one with all your lyrics and, [passionately], those little drawings in the margins—I mean, I've read every word probably, [excited], a thousand times over the years. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You still have that old thing after twenty years—I thought your mother would have, [confused], thrown out everything I left behind the moment I walked out that door, [trailing off], especially anything that might remind you of me.

Character 2 [en]: She tried to, um, but I hid it under my mattress and, well, [empathetically], read your words whenever I needed to remember that someone once believed I could be more than just, you know, another small-town disappointment.

Character 1 [en]: [moved] Emma, I mean, seeing you now all grown up and, well, [proudly], clearly having become your own person despite everything, it's like, um, witnessing a miracle I don't deserve. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] You know, um, I became a writer just like I told you I would, and, [cheerful], my first book is actually dedicated to, well, 'the wandering musician who taught me that leaving isn't always, you know, abandonment.' [cough]

Character 1 [en]: That's beautiful and more grace than I deserve considering how I just, [ashamed], vanished from your life when you needed stability, [guilty], not another adult walking away from their, [very melancholic], responsibilities.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Sometimes the best thing you can teach a child is that, [thoughtful], it's okay to choose yourself when staying would destroy you.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Um, I mean, thank you.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] So, um, maybe we could grab coffee and, [nervous], I could show you that first book—I mean, if you have time before you, well, disappear again. [laugh softly]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] I'm actually playing at the old café tomorrow night and it would mean, [happy], everything to see you there in the audience again.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] Um, I'll be there.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You know, um, I've played in countless venues over these twenty years but, [emotional], nothing ever felt as right as those evenings on your mother's porch with you as my, like, only audience, [voice breaking], believing every word I sang was somehow just for you.

Character 2 [en]: [smiling speaking] Well, um, maybe they were—I mean, maybe that's why I kept that notebook all these years, [understanding], knowing someday you'd come back and we'd both be ready for, [peaceful], whatever this becomes, you know. [deep breath]
