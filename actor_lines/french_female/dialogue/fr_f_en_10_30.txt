Character 1 [en]: So you're asking about my approach to differentiated instruction? Um, well, it's basically evolved over the years.

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] I've been struggling with this for months now. How do you actually manage to reach every single student when they're all at such different levels? It feels impossible sometimes, honestly.

Character 1 [en]: Oh gosh, I mean, you don't reach everyone every day. That's, uh, that's the first thing you need to accept.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I should have figured this out by now though, shouldn't I? After three years of teaching, you'd think I'd have some kind of system that actually works instead of just, I don't know, constantly feeling like I'm failing half the class.

Character 1 [en]: No no no, that's—look, three years is nothing. I've been doing this for twelve years and I still, um, I still redesign my whole approach every semester.

Character 2 [en]: Really? But how do you structure your lessons then? Like, when you're planning for Monday morning and you know Sarah needs advanced work while Marcus is still struggling with basics, what's your actual process?

Character 1 [en]: Alright, so I use station rotations. Basically four different activities running simultaneously, each targeting different skill levels.

Character 2 [en]: Okay, but doesn't that get chaotic? I mean, how do you monitor everyone and make sure they're actually engaged and not just, you know, going through the motions or completely lost?

Character 1 [en]: Mmm, yeah, it can definitely feel chaotic at first. The key is, uh, really explicit procedures. Like, painfully explicit.

Character 2 [en]: What about assessment though? If everyone's working on different levels of material, how do you fairly evaluate their progress? That's where I keep getting stuck.

Character 1 [en]: Oh, that's where mastery-based grading comes in. Students demonstrate competency at their own pace, not against some arbitrary timeline.

Character 2 [en]: But doesn't administration push back on that? Mine keeps insisting on traditional grades and standardized benchmarks, and I'm caught between what I know works and what they're demanding.

Character 1 [en]: Ugh, yeah, the administrative piece is... it's honestly the worst part. You have to basically maintain two sets of records.

Character 2 [en]: [deep pitch] How do you handle the really resistant learners though? The ones who've already decided they hate your subject before they even walk through the door?

Character 1 [en]: Those kids? Um, I start with relationships, not content. Spend two weeks just, like, figuring out what they actually care about.

Character 2 [en]: [groan] Two weeks? But we barely have enough time to cover the curriculum as it is. How do you justify that to parents when test scores come back?

Character 1 [en]: [smiling speaking] You know what's funny? Those two weeks actually save time later because suddenly they're, uh, they're actually participating instead of actively resisting everything.

Character 2 [en]: That makes sense, I guess. What about technology integration? Everyone keeps saying it's the solution to differentiation but honestly it feels like just another thing to manage.

Character 1 [en]: Mmm, technology's just a tool. Like, if you're using it to replicate worksheets, you're wasting everyone's time.

Character 2 [en]: So what would you say is the single most important shift you made in your teaching that actually improved differentiation? Because right now I feel like I'm drowning in strategies that all sound good but, I don't know, none of them seem to actually work in practice.
