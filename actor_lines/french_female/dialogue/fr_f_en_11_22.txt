Character 1 [en]: So I'm thinking about [very quickly] doing that open mic night next week. What do you think?

Character 2 [en]: Open mic nights are [laugh hard] brutal, honestly. You're basically throwing yourself to the wolves—drunk crowds, hecklers, people who'd rather be on their phones than watching you struggle through your set.

Character 1 [en]: Come on, it can't be that bad. I've been practicing my material.

Character 2 [en]: Practicing is, well, one thing, but actually, you know, performing is completely different, I mean, when you're up there alone. The lights make you sweat, your voice cracks, and suddenly every joke you thought was funny falls completely flat.

Character 1 [en]: You're being really negative about this.

Character 2 [en]: Just being realistic—ninety percent of first-timers bomb completely. The silence after a failed punchline is devastating, and trust me, it stays with you for weeks afterward, replaying in your mind.

Character 1 [en]: Have you done open mic before?

Character 2 [en]: Three times, and, uh, each one was worse than the last, honestly, like the audience could smell my fear or something. The worst part is watching other performers kill it while you're sitting there knowing you're about to die up there.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I should, um, start with something smaller, you know, like performing for friends first?

Character 2 [en]: Friends lie to you [apologetic] though, they'll say you're funny even when you're not. At least strangers give you honest feedback through their complete indifference or worse, their visible discomfort.

Character 1 [en]: You're really selling me on this experience.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I'm not trying [very loudly] to crush your dreams here! It's just that solo performance is incredibly isolating—you're completely exposed up there with nowhere to hide when things go wrong.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I guess, what if I, er, just try it once and, basically, see how it goes?

Character 2 [en]: Sure, try it once, but prepare for the emotional hangover. Most people quit after their first attempt because the rejection feels so personal—it's not like bombing in a group where you can share the blame.

Character 1 [en]: Do you, hmm, regret doing it, actually, even though it went badly?

Character 2 [en]: Regret is a strong word, but I definitely wish I'd had realistic expectations. The fantasy of being discovered or getting big laughs is so far from the reality of stumbling through five minutes while people order drinks.

Character 1 [en]: So, like, should I just, you know, not do it then, I mean, based on your experience?

Character 2 [en]: You'll probably do it anyway despite my warnings. Everyone thinks they'll be different, that their material is stronger, that they won't freeze up—but the stage has a way of humbling everyone equally.

Character 1 [en]: I still think I want to [short pause] try it, honestly, even if I, well, bomb completely.

Character 2 [en]: Fine, but don't say [stern] I didn't warn you. When you're up there dying, remember this conversation and know that I tried to prepare you for the crushing weight of performing alone.
