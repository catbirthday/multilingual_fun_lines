Character 1 [en]: How do you always get people to agree with you?

Character 2 [en]: Simple. I understand what they want before they do. Most people telegraph their needs through body language and word choice—once you see the pattern, you just give them what they're already looking for.

Character 1 [en]: [cry] I tried that approach with my boss and completely failed.

Character 2 [en]: You probably went in too soft. People respect strength, not attempts at strength. When you walk into a room, you need to own it completely or you've already lost.

Character 1 [en]: But isn't that manipulative?

Character 2 [en]: Call it whatever makes you comfortable. The fact is, every conversation is a negotiation, and someone's always winning. I prefer it to be me.

Character 1 [en]: What if they see through it?

Character 2 [en]: Then they're worth my time. Most people are sheep—they want to be led, they're desperate for someone to make decisions for them. The ones who push back are the only ones worth engaging with.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Have you ever lost a negotiation?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Twice. Both times taught me more than a hundred wins. Losing to someone better sharpens you—makes you hungrier, smarter, more ruthless next time.

Character 1 [en]: Who taught you all this?

Character 2 [en]: [clearing throat] My father, actually. He ran three companies into the ground before building his empire. Watching him fail taught me that kindness is weakness in business.

Character 1 [en]: That seems pretty harsh.

Character 2 [en]: The world is harsh. I'm just honest about it. While everyone else pretends to play nice, I'm taking what I want and building something that matters.

Character 1 [en]: Don't you care what people think of you?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I used to. Wasted five years trying to be liked instead of respected. Those are years I'll never get back, and the people I tried to please? They're all gone anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] Must be lonely at the top then.

Character 2 [en]: Loneliness is for people who need validation. I have power, I have control, and I sleep perfectly at night. Can you say the same?

Character 1 [en]: Actually, no. I can't.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly my point. Stop apologizing for who you are, stop seeking approval, and start taking what you deserve. The world won't hand it to you—you have to rip it away from someone else.
