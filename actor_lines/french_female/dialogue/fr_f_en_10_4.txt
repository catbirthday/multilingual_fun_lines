Character 1 [en]: So what's your take on collecting vintage watches?

Character 2 [en]: It's the perfect investment that you can actually wear. Every time I acquire a new piece, I'm not just buying an object—I'm buying a slice of history that appreciates while sitting on my wrist.

Character 1 [en]: Isn't it just conspicuous consumption though?

Character 2 [en]: That's what people say when they don't understand value retention. A Patek Philippe from the 1950s has outperformed the S&P 500 by miles. You can't wear a stock portfolio to dinner.

Character 1 [en]: How many do you own now?

Character 2 [en]: Seventeen at last count, but I'm negotiating for number eighteen as we speak. It's a 1969 Omega Speedmaster—the exact reference that went to the moon. The seller doesn't know what they have.

Character 1 [en]: That seems predatory.

Character 2 [en]: Business is business. If they haven't done their research, that's on them. I'm not running a charity—I'm building a collection that will fund my grandchildren's education.

Character 1 [en]: Do you ever actually wear them?

Character 2 [en]: Every single one gets wrist time. What's the point of owning beautiful machinery if you're going to lock it away? Though I do rotate them on a strict schedule—can't have uneven wear patterns.

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] Could you perhaps show me your favorite piece?

Character 2 [en]: The 1963 Rolex Daytona, no question. Bought it from an estate sale where the family had no idea what grandpa left behind. Paid eight thousand, it's worth ninety now.

Character 1 [en]: Jesus, that's quite a markup.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah well, while everyone else was buying cryptocurrency and losing their shirts, I was accumulating real assets. Tangible things that exist when the power goes out and servers crash.

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] Must be nice having that kind of disposable income.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Look, I started with a three-hundred-dollar Seiko from a pawn shop! Flipped it for five hundred, rolled that into the next piece. Anyone can do this if they commit to learning the market.

Character 1 [en]: What's your endgame here?

Character 2 [en]: There is no endgame—that's thinking about it wrong. This is about building something permanent, something that outlasts me. These watches were here before I was born and they'll be here after I'm gone.

Character 1 [en]: [very excited] Wait, you're leaving them to a museum?!

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely not. They're going to my kids with strict instructions: never sell to dealers, never break up the collection. This is about legacy, not charity. These stay in the family, period.
