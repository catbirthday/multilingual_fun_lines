Character 1 [en]: Hi, I'm, uh, Sarah, and honestly, I'm not great at, you know, introductions.

Character 2 [en]: Nice to meet you Sarah! I'm Marcus and I [enunciating every word] completely understand that feeling. Introductions are weird because you're trying to sum yourself up in a few sentences when you're obviously so much more complex than that.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly! Like how do you even pick what to share?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I usually start with, um, the basics and then, I guess, let the conversation naturally evolve from there, you know? Work stuff, hobbies, random facts about yourself—whatever feels authentic in the moment rather than forcing some rehearsed elevator pitch.

Character 1 [en]: I work in accounting, which sounds boring but it's actually not.

Character 2 [en]: Accounting gets such, er, a bad reputation but [very loudly] numbers tell stories, right, I mean they really do! Every spreadsheet is basically a narrative about how a business operates, where money flows, what priorities matter—it's detective work with math.

Character 1 [en]: You get it! Most people's eyes glaze over when I mention it.

Character 2 [en]: People think it's, like, all calculators and receipts, but actually, you're basically solving puzzles all day, hmm? Finding discrepancies, spotting patterns, making sure everything balances—it requires serious analytical thinking and attention to detail.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, what do you do, I mean, for work or, well, otherwise?

Character 2 [en]: I'm a [stuttering] f-freelance graphic designer, which m-means I work from home mostly. Some days I'm creating logos for startups, other days it's wedding invitations or restaurant menus—the variety keeps things interesting even when clients are being difficult.

Character 1 [en]: That [sleepily] sounds really creative and flexible.

Character 2 [en]: It definitely has its perks, though the isolation can be tough sometimes. You end up having full conversations with your cat just to hear another voice, and suddenly realize you haven't left the house in three days.

Character 1 [en]: I, actually, work from home twice a week now, and [formal] honestly, the quiet is, you know, kind of nice.

Character 2 [en]: The quiet is, uh, definitely peaceful at first, but then, I guess, it becomes almost too quiet, you know? You start missing those random water cooler conversations or even just hearing other people existing nearby—humans aren't meant to work in complete isolation.

Character 1 [en]: Do you ever work from coffee shops?

Character 2 [en]: Coffee shops are, well, hit or miss—sometimes the background noise is, like, perfect for focus, but honestly, other times it's chaos. You'll be deep in a project when someone starts a loud phone call about their medical problems right next to you.

Character 1 [en]: Yeah, I, er, tried that once and couldn't concentrate at all, basically, with all the, you know, distractions.

Character 2 [en]: The distractions are, um, definitely real, but [very sincerely] sometimes being around people, even strangers, actually helps with creativity, I mean. There's something about that ambient energy that makes you feel less alone in your work, even if nobody's actually talking to you.

Character 1 [en]: That makes sense. Maybe I should give it another try.

Character 2 [en]: You should, but, hmm, pick your spot carefully—some places are, well, more conducive to work than others, right? Look for those quieter neighborhood cafes rather than the busy downtown chains where everyone's basically shouting over the espresso machine.
