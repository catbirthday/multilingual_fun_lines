Character 1 [en]: So this is the Westfield Commons development? Looks bigger than the renderings suggested.

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, absolutely. The, um, actual footprint expanded by about fifteen percent after Brookfield Properties acquired the adjacent lot. They're actually targeting, like, a completely different demographic now than what they originally pitched.

Character 1 [en]: Different how? I thought this was supposed to be affordable housing.

Character 2 [en]: Well, see, that's the thing—it started as workforce housing but then Lennar Corporation came in as a partner and, honestly, everything shifted upmarket. Now we're looking at, mmm, probably starting prices around $450K which is, you know, not exactly affordable anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [bored] Great. Another luxury development pretending to solve the housing crisis.

Character 2 [en]: I mean, yeah, I hear you. The whole industry is kind of stuck in this pattern where, uh, developers like Toll Brothers and Pulte Homes basically chase the highest margins, which inevitably means luxury units.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] My sister got priced out of three neighborhoods because of developments like this.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, that's... that's rough. Gentrification is, honestly, probably the biggest issue facing urban planning right now, and companies like Related Companies, they're not exactly helping when they come in with these massive mixed-use projects.

Character 1 [en]: What about the community benefits they promised?

Character 2 [en]: [deep pitch] Okay so, technically they're still providing the park space and the, um, the retail component. But Hines Development renegotiated the agreement so now it's, like, significantly scaled back from what the community was expecting.

Character 1 [en]: Of course they did. Who's actually buying these units anyway?

Character 2 [en]: Mostly tech workers and, uh, some foreign investors actually. Greystar Real Estate Partners has been marketing heavily in Asia and, I mean, about thirty percent of pre-sales went to overseas buyers which is... yeah, it's a lot.

Character 1 [en]: Thirty percent? That seems excessive for a supposedly local development.

Character 2 [en]: Right? And that's actually becoming super common now. Companies like AvalonBay Communities are essentially building for global markets, not, you know, not really for the people who actually live and work here already.

Character 1 [en]: The city council approved this knowing all that?

Character 2 [en]: Well, mmm, Simon Property Group threw in some last-minute concessions—a few affordable units, some infrastructure improvements. But honestly, it's kind of like putting a band-aid on a, uh, on a broken system, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [sleepily] Same old story with every development. Promise the world, deliver a parking lot.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, exactly. And now Equity Residential is proposing something similar two blocks over, so we're basically watching the whole neighborhood transform in, like, real-time which is... it's pretty depressing actually.

Character 1 [en]: Think there's any chance the next project will be different?

Character 2 [en]: [trailing off] I mean, Forest City Realty Trust says they're committed to mixed-income housing but, um, we've heard that before and... I don't know, maybe this time will be different but probably not...
