Character 1 [en]: So um, have you ever tried, basically, creative writing as therapy?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I've been facilitating creative writing therapy groups for, you know, about three years now and it's sort of transformative. People often discover things about themselves they never knew were buried.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds really [long pause] intense for people.

Character 2 [en]: It can be, but we start gently with simple prompts like describing a safe place or writing letters to their younger selves. The beauty is that metaphor and fiction create this protective distance from raw emotions.

Character 1 [en]: How does fiction help with real problems though?

Character 2 [en]: When someone writes about a character facing their struggles, they're processing their own experiences without the overwhelming directness of "I" statements. It's like looking at your life through a softer lens while still doing the deep work.

Character 1 [en]: My therapist suggested I [cry loudly] try it but I'm terrified.

Character 2 [en]: That fear is actually really common, er, because writing makes thoughts permanent in a way that talking doesn't, I mean. But you can always burn, shred, or delete what you write - the healing happens in the process, not the product.

Character 1 [en]: Do people share their writing in groups?

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, sharing is always optional, honestly, and about half choose to keep their work private, like completely. What matters is the act of translating emotions into words, giving shape to things that felt shapeless.

Character 1 [en]: What if someone's not good at writing?

Character 2 [en]: There's no "good" or "bad" in therapeutic writing - it's not about crafting beautiful sentences but about authentic expression. Some of my most breakthrough sessions involved stick figures, single words repeated, or angry scribbles that became words.

Character 1 [en]: So, uhh, what kind of prompts do you use?

Character 2 [en]: We might write about doors we're afraid to open, conversations with our fears as characters, or rewrite difficult memories with different endings. Sometimes I'll bring in objects like keys or shells and ask people to write their stories.

Character 1 [en]: The thing is, uh, I don't even know where to start anyway.

Character 2 [en]: Start with lists - things that make you angry, moments you felt powerful, colors that match your moods. Lists are writing with training wheels, building confidence before diving into paragraphs.

Character 1 [en]: I guess, umm, that seems really manageable.

Character 2 [en]: Right so, even writing for five minutes about why you can't write is, basically, still writing, ah? The resistance itself becomes material to explore, which often leads to unexpected breakthroughs.

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, err, would you recommend starting alone or, you know, in a group?

Character 2 [en]: It's just that starting alone lets you build trust with yourself first, mmm, but groups offer this incredible mirror effect where hearing others' struggles makes yours feel less isolating, actually. Both paths lead to healing, just through different doors.
