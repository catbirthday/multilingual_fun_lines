# Speaker Lines Only (Translated) - French (Female)
============================================================

1. Hmm, let me see here... okay so between you and me? Moving service is actually one of my favorite things to help with because, um, I can usually sneak in some perks. Let me just pull up your account with reference number ACC-7829-XL94 here.
2. Ohhh nice, the Meridian Tower? Yeah so, um, I'm seeing here that, hmm, we actually have fiber coverage there which means... okay so this is good news, your current plan PLN-4472-B can transfer but I might be able to, uh, upgrade you to our premium tier for the same price.
3. Morrison Tech! Okay so, hmm, let me just... yeah we definitely want to make sure you're set up properly then. Your new address confirmation is ADR-9021-MT55 and, um, I'm actually going to flag this as a priority business transfer even though it's residential.
4. Well, let's just say... hmm, technically your account shows three years of perfect payment history with reference REC-6634-AA so, um, I think we can make an exception here. When exactly are you planning to move?
5. Penthouse? Oh wow, living the dream! So, um, Thursday is... hmm, let me check our installation windows here... okay so normally we're booked but, uh, I'm seeing a cancellation for Thursday morning between 8 and 10, slot number SLT-1192-TH if you can make that work?
6. Oh I totally get that concern. So, hmm, what I'm going to do here is... I'm putting a special note on order ORD-5547-PR that this needs our senior tech team, and, um, between you and me? I'm also adding my direct extension 4429 to your file so if anything goes sideways, you just call me directly.
7. Well, um, I mean you seem pretty cool and, hmm, honestly? After three years of being a great customer, you deserve to not have to explain everything again if you need help. Plus your confirmation number CNF-8823-VIP is, uh, going into our priority queue.
8. Hmm, actually... let me just, um, handle that right now for you. So I'm seeing our premium bundle package PKG-7701-MAX and, uh, with your loyalty status? I can add it for... okay so this is kind of ridiculous but it's showing only ten dollars more per month.
9. Let's just say, um, I might have applied a couple of, hmm, "promotional codes" that technically expired but, uh, the system still accepts them. Codes PMO-2234-X and PMO-5567-Z if anyone asks, but, you know, they probably won't.
10. Aww, well, um, honestly? You made my day too! So everything's confirmed with master order number MAS-9902-COMPLETE, Thursday morning installation at the Meridian Tower penthouse, and, hmm, I've made sure you're getting our white glove treatment. Anything else I can sneak in for you today?
11. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, I want to make sure I'm seeing everything correctly. Can I get your, um, what's the... your order confirmation number?
12. ORD-482, okay, um, and just to double-check, that's O-R-D dash four eight two? I'm seeing here that, uh, hmm, actually I need the full number with all the, um, all the characters after that?
13. Perfect, so, um, I've got ORD-4827-MP here and, uh, let me see... okay so that one's, hmm, showing as already processed but not shipped yet, which is actually, um, good news for what you're trying to do.
14. Okay okay, so, ummm, let me just, uh, make sure I've got all three... ORD-4827-MP, then, um, ORD-4829-LC, and, er, ORD-4831-PR. Is that, hmm, is that everything you wanted to combine?
15. Oh wow, yeah, so, um, sixty dollars is definitely, uh, that's a lot. Let me see here... hmm, okay so the system's showing me that, um, two of these are in our main warehouse—that's the MP and LC ones—but, uh, the PR order is coming from our, er, our satellite facility.
16. No no, wait, um, I think I can actually, uh, let me try something here... sometimes if I put in a, hmm, what's it called... a consolidation request? With the code CSL-MERGE-92, I can, um, I can override the facility difference.
17. Absolutely, so, ummm, I'm putting in the request now and, uh, okay so the system's asking me to... hmm, wait, let me just verify your shipping address real quick? Just to make sure everything, um, everything goes to the right place?
18. Perfect, 447 Elm Street, Austin, 78745. So, um, good news—the consolidation went through with confirmation number CNF-88293-COMB, and, uh, instead of sixty dollars, you're looking at, hmm, just eighteen fifty for combined shipping.
19. So with the combined shipping, um, let me check the, uh, the estimated delivery... okay so all three items under tracking number TRK-293847-UPS should arrive by, hmm, Thursday the 15th. Is that, um, is that going to work for the birthday party?
20. Oh, um, I totally get it, and honestly? Between you and me, the, uh, the consolidation thing isn't something we advertise but, hmm, for birthday parties especially, I always try to make it work. Your receipt number's going to be, um, RCP-77492-B and you should get an email confirmation in about, er, five minutes or so.
21. Oh no, yeah, I know, that system is honestly ridiculous sometimes. Um, let me just pull up your account here, uh, do you have your customer ID or order number handy?
22. No no, totally get it, um, that phone system makes everyone crazy, uh, we actually had a meeting about it last week because, er, so many people complain. Take your time, I can look you up by phone number too.
23. Um, perfect, so I've got you here, customer ID CST-49982-LV, and uh, I can see your recent order, um, ORD-7263-XM92, is that what you were calling about?
24. Yeah, it does that, um, especially with "track" for some reason, uh, it always thinks people are saying "back" or "black" and then, er, sends them to completely wrong departments. So anyway, let me check the tracking on ORD-7263-XM92 here.
25. Um, so, uh, good news is it's definitely on its way, tracking number TRK-8829374-US, but, er, I'm seeing it's running about, hmm, a day behind schedule.
26. No seriously, I'd be frustrated too. Um, the carrier had some weather delays yesterday, uh, but looking at your delivery area code ZIP-94022, it should, er, definitely arrive tomorrow by end of day.
27. Yeah, I'm pulling up the detailed tracking now on TRK-8829374-US and, um, it cleared the distribution center at 4 AM this morning, so, uh, unless something really unusual happens, you're good for tomorrow.
28. Um, honestly? The express shipping, uh, got delayed too with that weather, so, er, you actually saved money for the same result. Your confirmation RCP-7263-A shows standard shipping and, um, that was definitely the right call.
29. So if it's not there by 8 PM tomorrow, um, call back with reference number REF-8827-DELAY and, uh, we'll overnight a replacement at no charge, er, and you'd get that Thursday guaranteed.
30. REF-8827-DELAY, and um, ask for a supervisor directly if you need to call back, uh, just skip that awful automated system entirely, er, honestly we all hate it as much as you do.
31. Oh wow, um, fifth time—that's, uh, that's a lot. I'm gonna—wait, let me pull up your account here—actually, what's your account number or, um, phone number on file?
32. Either one works! I can look you up with—sorry, I mean, um, whatever's easier for you. I know with all the moves it gets, uh... confusing.
33. Perfect, got you right here! Account ACC-7749-MN2. And, um, I can see you've had—oh gosh—yeah, four address changes since January. Military family?
34. Oh, I totally get it. My brother's Air Force, so... yeah, I know, it's ridiculous how often you have to move. Um, so I'm gonna make sure—let me set up something here that'll help. Your new address?
35. So, um, I'm setting you up with our, uh, military family profile code—MIL-PREF-0923—which basically means, um, next time you call? You just give them that code and we can update everything in like... thirty seconds instead of all this.
36. Because honestly? Um, half our reps don't even—sorry, they don't know about it. It's not really, uh... advertised. But I'm making sure you're protected for next time.
37. I know, I know how it sounds. But look, um, I'm putting a note here—NOTE-85542-JK—that says, uh, "frequent military relocations, priority handling required" so even if you don't remember the code, anyone who pulls this up will... you know...
38. Um, yeah, no, I'm—look, moving five times in a year is, uh, it's insane, and our system makes it worse. So I'm updating your address to 4421 Base Road, confirmation CNF-2290-BASE, and, um, adding every single flag I can to make your life easier because... that's just ridiculous what you're dealing with.
39. Then you call, give them code MIL-PREF-0923 or reference, um, today's interaction ID INT-445821, and they'll... sorry, WE'LL get you sorted immediately. Also I'm waiving the, uh, the address change fee that's been charged to you the last four times because that's just...
40. So you've been charged, um, fifteen dollars each time—total of sixty dollars—which is, uh, absolutely getting refunded. Credit ref CRD-9901-RFND will show up in, um, three to five days. Military families shouldn't pay to... to update addresses when you're literally serving the country, that's just...
41. Well, I've been facilitating creative writing therapy groups for, you know, about three years now and it's sort of transformative. People often discover things about themselves they never knew were buried.
42. It can be, but we start gently with simple prompts like describing a safe place or writing letters to their younger selves. The beauty is that metaphor and fiction create this protective distance from raw emotions.
43. When someone writes about a character facing their struggles, they're processing their own experiences without the overwhelming directness of "I" statements. It's like looking at your life through a softer lens while still doing the deep work.
44. That fear is actually really common, er, because writing makes thoughts permanent in a way that talking doesn't, I mean. But you can always burn, shred, or delete what you write - the healing happens in the process, not the product.
45. Hmm, sharing is always optional, honestly, and about half choose to keep their work private, like completely. What matters is the act of translating emotions into words, giving shape to things that felt shapeless.
46. There's no "good" or "bad" in therapeutic writing - it's not about crafting beautiful sentences but about authentic expression. Some of my most breakthrough sessions involved stick figures, single words repeated, or angry scribbles that became words.
47. We might write about doors we're afraid to open, conversations with our fears as characters, or rewrite difficult memories with different endings. Sometimes I'll bring in objects like keys or shells and ask people to write their stories.
48. Start with lists - things that make you angry, moments you felt powerful, colors that match your moods. Lists are writing with training wheels, building confidence before diving into paragraphs.
49. Right so, even writing for five minutes about why you can't write is, basically, still writing, ah? The resistance itself becomes material to explore, which often leads to unexpected breakthroughs.
50. It's just that starting alone lets you build trust with yourself first, mmm, but groups offer this incredible mirror effect where hearing others' struggles makes yours feel less isolating, actually. Both paths lead to healing, just through different doors.
51. Nice to meet you Sarah! I'm Marcus and I [enunciating every word] completely understand that feeling. Introductions are weird because you're trying to sum yourself up in a few sentences when you're obviously so much more complex than that.
52. Well, I usually start with, um, the basics and then, I guess, let the conversation naturally evolve from there, you know? Work stuff, hobbies, random facts about yourself—whatever feels authentic in the moment rather than forcing some rehearsed elevator pitch.
53. Accounting gets such, er, a bad reputation but [very loudly] numbers tell stories, right, I mean they really do! Every spreadsheet is basically a narrative about how a business operates, where money flows, what priorities matter—it's detective work with math.
54. People think it's, like, all calculators and receipts, but actually, you're basically solving puzzles all day, hmm? Finding discrepancies, spotting patterns, making sure everything balances—it requires serious analytical thinking and attention to detail.
55. I'm a [bégayant] f-freelance graphic designer, which m-means I work from home mostly. Some days I'm creating logos for startups, other days it's wedding invitations or restaurant menus—the variety keeps things interesting even when clients are being difficult.
56. It definitely has its perks, though the isolation can be tough sometimes. You end up having full conversations with your cat just to hear another voice, and suddenly realize you haven't left the house in three days.
57. The quiet is, uh, definitely peaceful at first, but then, I guess, it becomes almost too quiet, you know? You start missing those random water cooler conversations or even just hearing other people existing nearby—humans aren't meant to work in complete isolation.
58. Coffee shops are, well, hit or miss—sometimes the background noise is, like, perfect for focus, but honestly, other times it's chaos. You'll be deep in a project when someone starts a loud phone call about their medical problems right next to you.
59. The distractions are, um, definitely real, but [très sincèrement] sometimes being around people, even strangers, actually helps with creativity, I mean. There's something about that ambient energy that makes you feel less alone in your work, even if nobody's actually talking to you.
60. You should, but, hmm, pick your spot carefully—some places are, well, more conducive to work than others, right? Look for those quieter neighborhood cafes rather than the busy downtown chains where everyone's basically shouting over the espresso machine.
61. Oh yeah, that's, uh, super common actually—parallelization overhead can, you know, totally kill performance if your workload isn't big enough. Are you using threads or processes, I mean, what's your setup?
62. Python multiprocessing for image processing... that's [en plaisantant] brave of you! But seriously, the pickle serialization between processes can be a massive bottleneck, especially if you're passing large image arrays back and forth.
63. Nope nope, so, Python processes can't share memory directly—they're, basically, completely separate. Every time you send data to a worker, hmm, Python has to serialize it, send it over, then deserialize it on the other side.
64. Exactly! For image processing you'd probably want shared memory arrays or maybe just use NumPy with proper vectorization. Sometimes good NumPy code beats naive parallelization by a mile.
65. Vectorization is, um, basically letting NumPy's [rapidement] C backend handle your loops instead of Python—like, you operate on entire arrays at once. It's usually way faster than, actually, explicit parallelization for many operations.
66. Then you'd want to, honestly, look into proper frameworks—OpenCV uses, well, optimized C++ under the hood, or maybe, I guess, GPU acceleration with CUDA if you're doing heavy lifting.
67. It's gotten way easier! Libraries like CuPy literally let you write NumPy-style code that runs on the GPU. You don't need to touch raw CUDA unless you're doing something really specialized.
68. Yeah and for your image stuff specifically, there's also things like RAPIDS or even just PyTorch for image operations. They handle all the scary memory transfer optimization behind the scenes.
69. Absolutely! PyTorch is, er, just a tensor library at its core—people use it for, like, all sorts of scientific computing. The GPU acceleration and, basically, automatic differentiation are just bonuses.
70. Starting fresh isn't always bad—sometimes you, honestly, need to pick the right tool first. Parallel computing is [passionnément] all about matching your problem to the right abstraction level, and, you know, Python multiprocessing is rarely the answer for number crunching!
71. [mesuré] She doesn't even remember you, [froid], not really, just the stories I've told her about the, [amer], parent who chose duty over, [voix qui s'éteint], being here when she took her first steps. [soupire]
72. [doux] There's always a choice even when, [plus doux], it feels like there isn't one to make at all.
73. [prudent] Making it work means, [patient], showing up every single day not just when your, [ferme], lord releases you from service to play at being, [sec], a parent for a few months. [expire lentement]
74. [scattered] Um, knowing something and, well, living through it alone while she, [tremblant], cries for someone who isn't there are, umm, completely different experiences that I can't, [creux], just forget. [longue pause]
75. [las] Money doesn't answer the questions about why, [douloureux], daddy lives in a castle while she lives here wondering if, [se brisant], she did something wrong. [voix qui se brise]
76. [tiraillé] Well, um, she needs stability not someone who might, [inquiet], disappear again when the next summons arrives, you know?
77. [surpris] You're giving up your, umm, knighthood for this, I mean, for her, [stupéfait], after working toward it your whole life?
78. [vacillant] She likes strawberries.
79. She has your stubbornness though—won't, um, give up on anything once she sets her, [doux], mind to it, like, even impossible puzzles that frustrate her to tears.
80. [acceptant] Tomorrow morning then, she wakes at sunrise and, [warmer], always wants someone to watch the birds with her.
81. Teaching her to, uh, [posé], survive is more accurate, and she came to me, you know, [matter-of-fact], begging for lessons after those kids at school put her in the hospital, I mean, twice.
82. [calme] She never told you about the bullying, um, [résigné], did she, or about how the school, well, [amer], basically told her to just avoid them like that's even possible, you know. [soupire]
83. [doux] Look, um, your kid's got real talent and, I mean, [impressed], more importantly she's got the discipline to use it responsibly which is, well, [songeur], rare in someone so young, you know, especially after what she's been through.
84. It pays better than, well, [pragmatic], most college degrees will ever get her, and umm, [frank], she'll learn skills that actually matter in the real world, not just, you know, [dédaigneux], theories from textbooks written by people who've never left their ivory towers.
85. [défensif] Skills like situational awareness that, [ferme], keeps you from becoming a victim, medical training that can, [passionné], save lives anywhere, and the confidence to, [fier], stand up for herself instead of hiding bruises under makeup.
86. [plus doux] Better doesn't always mean, um, [compréhensif], safer, and she knows that now because, well, [compatissant], she's seen what happens when you can't protect yourself or, you know, the people you care about.
87. [ferme] Then you should understand why she needs, [sincère], this training more than she needs your protection because, [direct], protection without preparation just makes her dependent on others.
88. [doucement] She already lost those dreams when three kids, [grave], cornered her in that bathroom and showed her what, [hard], the world really is when nobody's coming to save you.
89. [mesuré] She's not running toward danger, um, [patient], she's learning to face it on her own terms, and I mean, [respectful], that takes more courage than either of us can, well, [honnête], probably imagine at our age. [pauses]
90. [solennel] I'll make sure she's more prepared than, [committed], I ever was at her age, and that's, [sincère], a promise I don't make lightly.
91. [stupéfait] Wait, this is, um, a Silver Star with, [recognizing], a specific battalion number that I, well, I've seen before.
92. [tremblant] My brother was, um, one of those three soldiers and he, [voix qui se brise], still talks about the sergeant who went back into the flames even after his, [dépassé], own uniform caught fire, I mean, that was you.
93. [ému] He did. [en pleurs]
94. [désespéré] Listen, um, I can't let you sell this medal when you, [voix étranglée], saved the only family I have left, but I mean, I understand you need money so let me, [déterminé], help you another way.
95. Well, my brother owns, um, a construction company and he's been, [plein d'espoir], looking for someone who understands discipline and hard work, and I mean, [prudent], he never forgot the man who saved his life.
96. [ferme] He'll hire you today if you're willing because, um, he believes in, [passionné], second chances for people who've sacrificed everything, and well, there's an apartment above his office that's been empty for months. [pause]
97. [doux] You went back into hell itself to save strangers, so um, maybe it's time you let, [doux], someone return the favor by pulling you out of yours, I mean, that's what my brother would want.
98. [chaleureux] You're not just another anything.
99. [sincère] My brother says that medal represents the best, [fier], moment of his worst day, and meeting you represents the best, [plein d'espoir], moment of mine.
100. [certain] This isn't grace or luck, it's just, [posé], people taking care of each other the way we're supposed to. [smiles]
101. [défensif] I mean, you're not exactly supposed to be here either, um, with your lockpicks and, [nerveux], whatever else you're carrying in that bag that's, well, [accusateur], probably stolen from someone.
102. [retreating] These sets aren't pretend—they're, [passionné], more real than anything out there because they tell, [quieter], stories that actually matter instead of just, [amer], taking from people. [soupire]
103. [hurt] Well, I create things, um, beautiful things that might, [tremblant], inspire someone someday, while you just, er, [dégoûté], tear through people's lives and take what isn't, [en colère], yours to take.
104. [surpris] Um, don't try to romanticize what you do by, well, [sceptique], comparing it to art—you destroy while I, er, [ferme], desperately try to create something meaningful.
105. [vacillant] Sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever, [triste], see what I've made here. [longue pause]
106. You know, um, the owner died three years ago and, [melancholic], his family just forgot this place exists, so I've been, well, [confessing], turning it into something that honors what theater used to, [nostalgique], mean.
107. And you risk everything to, [curieux], take things—what are you really looking for out there? [pause]
108. [ferme] Well, then stop taking things and, um, maybe try, [plein d'espoir], creating something worth protecting instead, you know?
109. [fier] Every impossible thing starts with someone, [passionné], deciding to try anyway, with choosing to build rather than, [pointu], break, to leave something behind that might, [mélancolique], outlast us.
110. [doucement] Well, um, stay then. [plein d'espoir]
111. Well, um, I understand the urgency but this five-year-old has already been through, [protective], three foster homes in the past year, and I mean, another sudden relocation could cause irreversible psychological damage, you know. [soupire]
112. [frustré] Every child in my care deserves stability and you're asking me to, [luttant], uproot her entire world based on threats that may never materialize.
113. [défensif] Well, you know, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, um, I've never had to, [en colère], choose between a child's immediate safety and their, [voix brisée], long-term emotional wellbeing like this, and I mean, there has to be, [désespéré], another way to protect her.
114. [méfiant] So, um, you're asking me to traumatize this little girl based on, [amer], classified information that you can't even, well, verify, while I'm supposed to just, [incrédule], trust your judgment about her life, you know?
115. [stupéfait] You just used her name which violates every protocol we, [réalisant], established about keeping her identity separate from her mother's case, [tremblant], and now I understand you're more terrified than you're, [ému], letting on. [longue pause]
116. [résolu] Then we move tonight but I'm coming with her through the, [déterminé], entire relocation process because she trusts me and I won't, [féroce], let her face this alone.
117. [doucement] I'll need to create a cover story for her current foster family that won't, [songeur], raise suspicions but also explains why she's suddenly, [triste], gone without causing them to file missing person reports.
118. [acceptant] Give me two hours to pack her favorite toys and the, [tendre], blanket she can't sleep without because maintaining those small, [se brisant], comforts might be all that keeps her grounded.
119. I know, um, but safe doesn't always mean, [lourd], undamaged, and well, that's what keeps me up at night, you know.
120. [résigné] Well, I mean, I'll hold you to that promise because, um, if we're wrong about this and she ends up, [fearful], more broken than before, I'll never forgive either, [amer], of us for what we're about to, [voix qui s'éteint], do, you know.
121. [choqué] Oh my God, um, Riley? I mean, is that really you standing here with, well, your face all swollen like that after, er, five years of nothing?
122. [professional] Okay, um, sit down immediately and, [focused], tell me what you've been exposed to in the last, [urgent], hour—did you eat something, er, get stung, or touch anything unusual?
123. Um, well, stay still.
124. [doux] I'm getting the epinephrine now, and um, for what it's worth, I'm, [tiraillé], glad you came here even if it's just because you're, [triste], desperate, because at least I know you're, well, still alive. [soupire]
125. [administering shot] This might sting a bit but you'll, [rassurant], feel better in about thirty seconds, and then we need to, [prudent], monitor you for the next hour. [pauses]
126. Well, um, not everything.
127. [doux] Yeah, well, that's why I went into public health, um, trying to prevent what we couldn't, [voix qui se brise], prevent for her, while you, er, went the opposite direction.
128. [hésitant] I actually, um, downloaded your band's EP last month, and well, that song about hospital waiting rooms made me, [ému], cry in my office. [laughs softly]
129. [plein d'espoir] Well, maybe after you're stable, um, we could grab coffee and actually, [nerveux], talk instead of just existing in the same city pretending the other doesn't exist?
130. [soulagé] Look, um, the swelling's going down already, and well, your color's coming back, which means you're, [professional], responding well to the treatment, but also means you're, [personal], going to be okay, and er, maybe we can be too. [soupire profondément]
131. Hi there! Um, I can definitely help with that. So, uh, just need to pull up your account here—what's your employee ID number? I think we can, um, track that down pretty quickly.
132. Got it, um, 474-829... okay so I'm seeing here, hmm, your last reimbursement request RMB-9042-TK was, uh, processed on the 15th. Should've arrived by now, I think.
133. Oh! Um, I totally understand that frustration. Let me just, uh, check the payment status here... REF-9042-TK shows, hmm, mailed on the 17th to your address on file.
134. Right right.
135. So, um, I can definitely start that process. The thing is, uh, for check CHK-8827-MN over fifty dollars, I need to, hmm, verify it wasn't cashed first. Takes maybe, um, two business days?
136. I know, I know. Um, actually, let me see if... hmm, there might be another option here. Can I, uh, put you on a brief hold? Maybe thirty seconds?
137. Absolutely.
138. No no! So, um, good news actually. I found, uh, an expedite code EXP-2847 that I can apply. We can, hmm, cancel the original and, um, issue direct deposit instead? Should hit by, uh, tomorrow morning.
139. Yep! Um, I just need to, uh, confirm your direct deposit info. Last four of your account on file is, hmm, 7829?
140. Oh absolutely, I, um, completely agree. You guys work so hard and, uh, this shouldn't happen. So I've noted everything under case CSE-4492-BN and, hmm, added a priority flag. Should be all set by tomorrow!
141. Ah je vois—laissez-moi juste—en fait attendez, euh, est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de compte d'abord? Je suis en train d'ouvrir le, euh, le système de paiement là et j'ai besoin de—hmm, oui j'en ai besoin pour consulter les détails spécifiques de votre transaction.
142. Absolument, alors euh, une fois que vous me donnez ce numéro de compte je peux tout voir—le statut du paiement, les délais, tout—mais je dois mentionner que, euh, on a eu des retards dans notre système aujourd'hui, alors j'espère que le vôtre n'est pas affecté mais laissez-moi—laissez-moi vérifier pour vous.
143. Compris compris, alors je regarde le compte ACC-4439-P et, euh, je vois que vous avez un paiement en attente ici pour—oh là c'est conséquent—ça apparaît comme, euh, initié hier mais hmm... laissez-moi juste... bon alors malheureusement c'est dans ce qu'on appelle un statut de révision ce qui veut dire—et j'aurais vraiment aimé avoir de meilleures nouvelles—ça ne va pas passer avant demain au plus tôt.
144. Je sais je sais, et croyez-moi si je pouvais juste, euh, appuyer sur un bouton et que ça se fasse instantanément je le ferais—mais ces blocages de révision sont, euh, ils sont automatiques selon le montant et je n'ai pas—hmm, en fait attendez, laissez-moi vérifier autre chose, parfois il y a une solution de contournement...
145. Bon alors, euh, je vois ici que votre transaction TXN-882947-VN est signalée parce qu'elle dépasse notre plafond journalier—mais voilà ce que je peux faire—enfin, c'est pas idéal mais—je peux diviser ça en deux paiements plus petits qui seraient, euh, ils seraient traités immédiatement, genre dans l'heure, mais vous devriez appeler votre lieu et expliquer les deux virements séparés.
146. Oui mais—et je déteste qu'il y ait un mais ici—euh, il y a des frais de traitement pour les virements express, ça va être, euh, laissez-moi calculer... bon alors c'est 47,50$ par transaction, donc vous regardez 95 dollars au total en frais et je sais que c'est pas—enfin, j'aimerais pouvoir les annuler mais le système ne me laisse pas.
147. Euh, d'accord alors je—attendez en fait j'ai besoin de—laissez-moi obtenir une confirmation verbale, vous autorisez deux virements express de, euh, 4 250$ chacun avec les codes de confirmation EXP-7739-A et EXP-7739-B, frais totaux quatre-vingt-quinze dollars?
148. Alors une fois que je soumets ça—ce que je fais maintenant en fait—vous allez recevoir, euh, vous allez recevoir les confirmations par email dans cinq minutes, et puis les fonds arrivent sur leur compte dans, euh, typiquement quarante-cinq minutes mais absolument dans l'heure, et franchement je suis vraiment contente qu'on ait trouvé une solution parce que je sais à quel point cette situation est stressante.
149. Absolument absolument, et en fait donnez-leur ces numéros de référence—donc c'est REF-559048-RUSH1 et REF-559048-RUSH2—parce que, euh, leur banque peut les tracer immédiatement même avant que les fonds soient complètement compensés, ce qui parfois aide avec, euh, vous savez, gagner un peu de bonne volonté pendant qu'ils attendent.
150. C'est fait, je viens d'appuyer sur soumettre alors, euh, vérifiez votre email dans environ trois minutes pour ces confirmations—et franchement, euh, bonne chance avec vos événements ce weekend, j'espère qu'ils se passeront bien après tout ce stress aujourd'hui, vraiment.
151. D'accord, euh, j'entends bien que vous êtes frustrée et, euh, laissez-moi d'abord... comment dire... reconnaître ça. Vous pouvez me donner votre numéro de commande pour que je, euh, puisse tout consulter et on va régler ça ?
152. C'est noté, alors, euh, je vois ici que c'est en fait, euh, numéro de commande OLM-4492-BK7, et hmm, laissez-moi regarder les spécifications que vous avez commandées par rapport à ce qui... oh. Oh là là.
153. Alors, euhh, je vois que les mesures sont, euh, complètement différentes de ce que vous avez soumis, genre la profondeur indique 18 pouces mais vous aviez commandé, euh, 24 pouces, et la hauteur est... c'est pas du tout ça.
154. Écoutez, euh, je sais que ça semble impossible là maintenant mais, euh, on va arranger ça, d'accord ? Laissez-moi juste, hmm, vérifier nos options express sous votre compte ACC-7829-ML...
155. Je consulte notre système de livraison d'urgence, code EFS-90124, et, euh, je vais m'assurer que vous soyez prise en charge, genre priorité absolue...
156. Alors, euh, c'est pas quelque chose qu'on publicise mais, euh, pour des situations comme celle-ci où c'est clairement notre erreur, je peux, hmm, activer le protocole PRX-5001 qui en gros veut dire...
157. Je vais personnellement superviser ce dossier, d'accord ? Votre nouvelle référence c'est REF-8956-XP2, et euh, il faut que vous sachiez que je ne laisserai pas ça foirer encore une fois...
158. Euhh, alors voilà ce que j'ai fait—j'ai marqué ça comme critique sous le ticket TKT-30459, et euh, j'ai notre entrepôt local qui vérifie le stock maintenant pour une livraison immédiate, euh, le jour même en fait.
159. L'entrepôt vient de confirmer sous vérification VRF-1128 que, euh, ils ont vos spécifications exactes en stock, et je, euh, m'assure que le chauffeur vérifie deux fois chaque mesure avant de partir.
160. Euh, alors votre créneau de livraison c'est 14h à 16h aujourd'hui sous suivi TRK-6673-QM9, et écoutez, je vous donne mon poste direct—faites le 4429—parce que, euh, je veux que vous m'appeliez s'il y a le moindre problème, on va pas... ça n'arrivera plus.
161. D'accord je peux certainement vous aider avec ça aujourd'hui, laissez-moi juste chercher votre numéro de police rapidement—est-ce que vous l'avez sous la main ou je devrais le chercher par votre nom?
162. [expire] C'est parfaitement correct, euh, laissez-moi juste... comment dire... faire une référence croisée de votre compte ici. Alors j'aurai besoin de votre nom complet et, euh, le code postal sur la police, and then I can pull up everything including your policy number PLC-449821-V7.
163. Bon alors, euh, j'ai votre compte ici David et, euh, je peux voir l'augmentation de prime qui est entrée en vigueur et... hmm, laissez-moi juste vérifier les, euh, les notes ici sur le compte ADJ-20241105-SF.
164. Oui malheureusement ça a été traité le 1er novembre, et en regardant votre dossier ici je peux voir le code d'ajustement RTE-RIDESHARE-01 qui indique—this is related to commercial usage disclosure.
165. [sharp inhale] Laissez-moi vérifier votre application originale de mars, donnez-moi juste un moment pour réviser le document APP-3847291-DC.
166. Alors je vois ici que, euh, la déclaration de covoiturage était en fait, euh, ajoutée à votre dossier en octobre through form FRM-1099-UPDATE et c'est ce qui... hmm, c'est ce qui a déclenché le recalcul du tarif dans le code système CALC-88472-AUTO.
167. [expire] Bon, alors ce qui s'est passé ici c'est, euh, et je vois ça beaucoup en fait, euh, la police initiale n'avait pas le code d'endossement commercial END-RS-2024 et quand on a reçu les informations mises à jour ça devait être, euh, recalculé.
168. Exactement, conduire pour le covoiturage nécessite une couverture spécifique qui coûte plus cher due to the increased risk factors documented in rate table RT-2024-Q4-COMM.
169. Vous n'êtes pas lente du tout David, la terminologie d'assurance est confuse et honnêtement je suis encore en train d'apprendre certaines choses moi-même—laissez-moi voir s'il y a un code de réduction que je peux appliquer pour aider à compenser cette augmentation.
170. Alors, euh, j'ai trouvé le code de réduction DISC-SAFE-DRIVER-15 qui vous donne 15 pourcent de rabais et, euh, j'applique aussi le crédit CRD-99847-LOYALTY pour être avec nous depuis plus de 6 mois, so that should, hmm, réduire votre prime d'environ 70 dollars au total.
171. Thank you for calling. Um, let me just... pull up your account here. Could I get your, uh, order number or... if you have that handy?
172. That's okay. Take your time. Um, we can also look it up by, uh, your business name or email if that's... I mean, whatever's easier for you right now.
173. Perfect. Let me just... okay so I'm seeing, um, order number ORD-4429-SP91 here. Shipped November 15th. And, uh, you're asking about the... hmm, these additional charges that came through?
174. Right. So, um, I can see what happened here. The thing is—um, let me just—okay so your shipment crossed through, uh, multiple customs zones. Transaction ID TXN-88542-CU shows... hmm, how do I explain this...
175. Yeah so, um, it's actually... complicated. Your package went through, uh, through Newark first. Then London. Then, um, finally to Frankfurt. Each transfer point has its own... well, its own fee structure.
176. I completely understand your frustration. Um, looking at your account... reference number REF-2298-XK... these surcharges should have been, uh, disclosed during checkout. Let me see if... hmm, if something went wrong there.
177. So, um, I'm checking the system and, uh, there's a note here. Invoice INV-66019-B. It looks like... hmm, these fees were added after, um, after your shipment was already processed because of... weight recalculation?
178. I know. It doesn't... okay so, um, here's what I can do. I'm going to, uh, escalate this to our billing team. Case number CSE-90124-RT. And, um, we'll review whether these charges were... properly communicated.
179. Absolutely. Yes. Um, so let me just... I'm adding priority status. Code PRI-445. And, uh, between you and me? These international fees have been, um, causing issues for other merchants too. We're actually... reviewing the whole process.
180. So, um, with the priority code? Within 24 hours. Definitely. Uh, they'll call the number on file... ends in 7829? And they'll have, um, full authority to adjust these charges. Is that... will that work?
181. Oh! Um, hello Mr.—er, sorry, I didn't catch your, uh, your name there, but let me just, um, pull up your account and, uh, we'll get this sorted out for you, okay? So if you could just, um, give me your account number or, uh, maybe the order reference?
182. Perfect, so um, that's actually, uh—wait, let me just—okay so RFQ-2847-TK92, and I can see here that, um, you've been transferred... oh wow, uh, three times already today? That's, er, definitely not the experience we want for you, and um, I'm really sorry about that.
183. Okay so, um, let me dig into this because, uh, this is like a... what's the word... a priority institutional account, and um, I can see you ordered—er, sorry, let me scroll—forty-seven items with purchase order PON-88459-QD on October 12th, is that right?
184. Um, absolutely, and uh, I'm actually seeing something really, um, interesting here—so your order got, uh, split into three shipments, and um, it looks like tracking number TRK-9901245-A went to—wait no, sorry, that's the wrong—let me just double-check this for you.
185. No no, I've, um, I've got it! So uh, this is actually—oh! I see what happened here—your order got, er, flagged in our bulk processing system under code BLK-77234, and um, someone marked it as residential instead of institutional, which is, uh, why nobody could find it.
186. I know, it's, um, it's completely wrong and uh, I'm fixing it right now—so the good news is, er, all three shipments with tracking TRK-9901245-A, TRK-9901246-A, and TRK-9901247-A are actually, um, already at your receiving dock as of, uh, let me see... yesterday at 2:47 PM.
187. Um, yes! So like, they've been signed for by, uh, someone with initials JMK at your, um, at your loading dock, and uh, I'm sending you the, er, the delivery confirmations now to reference number CNF-445789-WD22.
188. Yeah, so um, the issue was that, uh, because of the residential flag, the system wasn't, er, wasn't linking it to your institutional account properly, which is like... what's the word... a database mismatch thing, but um, I've corrected it now under update code UPD-123477-R.
189. Oh! So, um, I'm actually adding a, uh, a special routing note to your account—it's like, er, a VIP flag basically—with code VIP-8834521, and um, I'm also giving you my direct extension which is, uh, 4479, so you can, um, bypass the regular queue entirely.
190. Perfect! And um, just so you know, I've also, uh, credited your account—it's showing as credit CRD-90128-KL—for, er, for all the trouble today, and um, that should appear within, uh, twenty-four to forty-eight hours, okay?
191. Oh! Um, okay so. Let me. Er, pull that up. Just need your account number or, uh, email?
192. No worries! That's, um, totally normal actually, so, uh, happens all the time. What email did you, er, use for the account?
193. Perfect. Got it. Um, so I'm seeing here, uh, account ID ACC-7829-MX91. Is that, er, for the premium subscription that started, hmm, back in August?
194. Completely understand! So, um, that's. That's frustrating. Let me just, uh, check here. Transaction TXN-445821-QR shows, er, three months of charges at $29.99?
195. Hey. It's okay. Really. Um, so like, this happens more than you'd think, and uh, we can definitely. We can fix this.
196. Absolutely. Canceling now. Done. Um, and so, I'm also seeing here that, er, we can issue a partial refund? For last month's charge under policy POL-8847-C?
197. Um, yes! So basically, uh, since you haven't logged in, er, for over 30 days according to, hmm, let me see... report RPT-2901-K. We can refund October.
198. Oh! Platinum. Let me. Um, so checking your status here, member ID MEM-55492-PL and, uh, you're right. Different policy applies.
199. So, um, processing full refund. All three months. Er, confirmation number is, uh, REF-78823-PLT and you'll see that in, hmm, 3-5 business days.
200. All done! Um, sent confirmation to your email. Receipt RCP-90127-X attached. And, uh, again? Don't feel bad. Happens constantly. You're all set.
201. D'accord, euh, laissez-moi juste... trouver ça ici et, euh, je peux définitivement regarder ça pour vous... alors c'est quoi le... hmm... le numéro de compte?
202. Bon bon, je l'ai. Alors je vois le compte 4-7-7-2-9 ici et il y a une charge pour... laissez-moi trouver l'exact... okay oui, Premium Monitoring activé le 15 octobre avec code de confirmation PMN-88264-QV.
203. Je comprends que vous êtes frustrée et, euh, je vais... ce que je peux faire c'est... hmm... je dois vérifier la méthode d'activation...
204. Alors, euh, selon le système ici, le service était, euh, activé par votre portail en ligne avec, euh, transaction ID TXN-994527361 à 15h47 et il y a une... hmm... comment dire... une signature digitale.
205. Je vous entends, et même si je peux pas enlever les charges validées... laissez-moi voir quelles alternatives... okay alors je peux soumettre une demande d'audit, case number AUD-7739-RF22, which takes 5-7 business days.
206. Ou... actually wait, laissez-moi vérifier autre chose ici... je sors vos données d'usage...
207. Okay alors, euh, intéressant... le service de monitoring montre, euh, zéro usage depuis l'activation, genre, no logins, no alerts accessed, nothing... hmm...
208. Exactement. Alors avec zéro usage je peux... euh, laissez-moi vérifier notre politique sur... euh... les services non utilisés... une seconde...
209. Je l'ai trouvée. Alors parce qu'il y a pas d'usage dans le dossier REC-55412-NM, je peux escalader ça à notre équipe de révision de facturation avec priority flag PRI-2847... they can authorize a partial credit.
210. Alors, euh, voici ce que je fais... j'ajoute des notes à propos du, euh, zéro usage, la confusion sur l'activation, et, euh, je demande une révision complète sous ticket TKT-338856-B qui, hmm, entre vous et moi? Usually gets approved for cases like this.
211. Ah ouais, alors genre, je comprends totalement ça – ça m'arrive aussi en fait, euh, justement le mois dernier avec mon paiement auto. Alors en gros laisse-moi, euh, sortir votre dossier là et, hmm, c'est quoi votre numéro de compte?
212. C'est noté c'est noté.
213. Ouais alors, euh, je regarde le compte ACC-447298841 là et, euh, bonne nouvelle en fait – vous avez jamais demandé de report avant donc genre, on peut carrément s'arranger avec vous pour ça.
214. Alors normalement, euh, on peut faire genre sept à dix jours, mais euh, voilà le truc – je vois que vous êtes avec nous depuis, hmm, trois ans? Jamais manqué avant? Donc je vais, euh, vous mettre quatorze jours si ça vous aide.
215. Franchement? Genre ma manager m'a fait pareil quand je traversais des trucs, alors, euh, ouais. Le code de report EXT-92847-TMP est, euh, déjà en traitement et en gros vous allez recevoir la confirmation dans genre cinq minutes.
216. Exactement ça.
217. Alors genre, euh, je sais que c'est stressant mais euh, voilà ce que je me dis toujours – vous avez appelé, vous avez géré, c'est, euh, c'est vraiment responsable en fait? La transaction TXN-884291-EX est réglée et genre, pas de frais de retard ni rien.
218. Oh absolument, alors euh, c'est vraiment malin ça parce que, euh, comme ça vous avez plus jamais à genre vous soucier des dates. Laissez-moi, hmm, vous envoyer le lien pour le prélèvement auto à, euh, l'email qu'on a dans le dossier là.
219. Non je veux dire, euh, je vous comprends – genre la technologie quoi? Mais euh, franchement entre nous, ça m'a sauvée tellement de fois. Numéro de référence REF-20847-AP pour les, euh, instructions du prélèvement auto et genre, vous pouvez le programmer pour n'importe quel jour qui vous arrange.
220. Alors en gros ouais, euh, vous êtes totalement réglée – paiement dû le 28 maintenant, la confirmation CON-449281-X devrait arriver dans votre boîte mail, et euh, les infos pour le prélèvement auto arrivent aussi. Genre, vous avez tout géré donc, euh, vraiment plus rien à vous inquiéter maintenant.
221. Oh salut, oui, laisse-moi regarder ça—en fait c'est drôle, ma fille fait partie d'une équipe de voyage alors je comprends totalement la situation des hôtels, ces road trips coûtent cher, right? C'est quoi le numéro de confirmation ou, euh, la date du séjour?
222. D'accord, d'accord—alors je vois ici... okay il y a une réservation REF-7823-JM du 15 juin, et on dirait qu'il y a eu des frais accessoires facturés à la chambre, laisse-moi juste... ouais, 342 dollars en frais accessoires en plus du tarif de la chambre.
223. Oh merde, je te comprends—le coaching freelance c'est dur, mon beau-frère fait des camps de basketball et c'est soit la fête soit la famine, tu sais? En regardant la ventilation ici, le code de frais INC-4421-A montre 150 pour ce qui semble être du room service, puis il y a INC-4421-B pour 92 dollars marqué comme minibar...
224. Ouais non, question totalement légitime—honnêtement, les hôtels sont notoires pour ces trucs, j'ai eu une charge une fois pour un peignoir que j'ai jamais même vu... Laisse-moi creuser plus dans le transaction log TXN-882934-C ici, parfois les descriptions sont fausses ou ils facturent accidentellement la mauvaise chambre.
225. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, je comprends. Alors ce que je—laisse-moi juste—en fait, tu sais quoi? Since this is from three months back, je peux enregistrer ça sous le case number DSP-9847-TL comme dispute retardée, which gives us more options to work with.
226. Non non, pas stupide du tout—basically ça veut dire qu'on peut investiguer même si c'est passé la fenêtre normale de 60 jours, et honnêtement entre toi et moi, le dispute code DSP nous donne beaucoup plus de flexibilité qu'une enquête standard.
227. Fair. Complètement fair. Dis-moi quoi—je vais t'envoyer un email maintenant même, reference number EML-7823-JP, avec le processus exact de dispute et la timeline, et tu vas recevoir une confirmation automatique de notre système, pas de moi, montrant que le case DSP-9847-TL est officiellement ouvert.
228. Right? C'est genre—quoi, 40 sacs de chips? Écoute, je vois le pattern code PAT-881 ici qui signale des frais de minibar inhabituellement élevés, ça arrive souvent quand le capteur est déclenché plusieurs fois ou quelqu'un restocke mal...
229. Ouais, je—écoute, voici ce que je vais faire. Je mets un provisional credit PCT-9923-K pour la moitié du montant maintenant, 171 dollars, pendant qu'on investigate, so at least you've got something back immediately instead of waiting.
230. Déjà en traitement—tu vas voir le credit PCT-9923-K dans 24 à 48 heures, et honnêtement, avec ce sensor flag que j'ai mentionné? We'll probably get the rest reversed too, ces affaires-là vont habituellement notre bord quand il y a un pattern.
231. Oh pas de souci du tout. Euh, laissez-moi juste retrouver ça pour vous et, euh, on va régler ça avant qu'il y ait un problème. Est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de réclamation ? Ça commencerait par CLM-
232. C'est noté.
233. Hé, euh, vous appelez maintenant et c'est ça qui compte. Alors je regarde CLM-7924-RG ici et, euh, je vois que c'est pour des matériaux de toiture, et... hmm, laissez-moi m'assurer qu'on accélère bien le traitement parce que la saison des tempêtes arrive.
234. Exact exact.
235. Non non non, vous ne dramatisez pas du tout. Euh, c'est de votre gagne-pain qu'on parle là. Donc, euh, je vais marquer ça avec le code priorité PRI-8856-STORM et, euh, en gros ça vous met en tête de file...
236. En fait, euh, je dois absolument faire ça pour vous. Voyez, votre date de soumission initiale c'était le 15 mars, donc vous êtes largement dans les délais, et euh, avec votre licence d'entrepreneur CON-4429-FL au dossier, vous êtes éligible pour notre service professionnel accéléré que, hmm, franchement quelqu'un aurait dû vous expliquer...
237. Euh, écoutez, entre gérer les fournisseurs et les clients et la météo... euh, je vais m'assurer que ce soit traité d'ici demain soir. Votre approbation devrait apparaître comme APP-7924-CONFIRMED.
238. Normalement oui, mais euh, voilà ce que je fais—et je documente tout dans la note de dossier CN-58847—je marque ça comme infrastructure critique météo, ce qui, euh, techniquement c'est le cas puisque vous protégez des maisons avant les tempêtes...
239. Oh... Euh, je suis vraiment désolée. Ça a dû être... Écoutez, euh, je mets mon poste direct ici—c'est le 4-7-7-2—et s'il y a quoi que ce soit, euh, le moindre retard, vous m'appelez directement et je... je m'en occupe personnellement.
240. Euh, hé, vous n'êtes pas dans un sale état, vous êtes préparée. Et, euh, c'est exactement ce dont vos clients ont besoin maintenant. Vérifiez vos mails pour la confirmation EML-7924-SENT dans environ, hmm, cinq minutes, et on va s'assurer que vous soyez prête pour n'importe quelle météo qui arrive.
241. Oh là, en fait j'ai—attends, laisse-moi juste—ça m'est littéralement arrivé la semaine dernière avec une machine à café, donc je comprends totalement à quel point c'est frustrant de voir le prix baisser juste après.
242. Absolument, alors euh—laisse-moi juste—bon alors j'ai besoin de, euh, retrouver votre compte ici et, euh, vous avez dit que vous l'avez acheté quand ? Et, euh, vous auriez le numéro de commande par hasard ?
243. Parfait, alors je suis—attends, en fait c'est—euh, c'est le numéro de reçu ça ou, euh, parce que j'ai besoin du numéro de commande qui devrait être genre, euh, ORD et puis des chiffres ?
244. Okay okay, alors, euh, je l'ai ici et, euh, wow vous plaisantiez pas, ça a baissé de, euh, 30 euros aujourd'hui, alors laisse-moi—enfin, je vais—en fait, euh, tu sais quoi ? Je vais traiter ça tout de suite.
245. Non non, euh, y a vraiment pas de piège, enfin—alors le truc c'est que—euh, on a cette politique de protection des prix pendant, euh, sept jours après l'achat, et votre commande ORD-77453-MK92 est, euh, clairement dans cette période, donc c'est vraiment, euh, super simple en fait.
246. Oh question totalement légitime—alors en fait je suis—je viens de le soumettre, et vous devriez recevoir un email de confirmation dans environ deux minutes avec le numéro de référence ADJ-9982341-C montrant le crédit de 30 euros.
247. Ouais alors, euh, pendant que ça se traite, je voulais juste—euh, je voulais mentionner, genre, pour la prochaine fois ? Euh, vous pouvez en fait, euh, configurer des alertes de baisse de prix dans votre compte pour pas avoir à, euh, vérifier manuellement.
248. Je comprends—et euh, franchement ? Genre, j'ai été—euh, enfin, je travaille ici et même moi je me suis fait, euh, avoir par des changements de prix avant, donc je comprends totalement pourquoi vous seriez, euh, hésitante à faire confiance au système.
249. Voilà voilà, alors euh, le traitement standard c'est, euh, trois à cinq mais—bon alors, euh, entre nous ? Ça passe généralement, euh, en genre, euh, 24 heures, ils disent juste plus long pour être sûrs.
250. C'est ça, ouais—et puis, j'ai ajouté une note sur votre compte à ce sujet, donc s'il y a un problème—ce qui n'arrivera pas—mais s'il y en a un, mentionnez juste le numéro de dossier CSE-108847-P et n'importe quel agent pourra voir exactement ce qu'on a fait aujourd'hui.
251. Ah, je vais carrément vous aider à vérifier ça—laissez-moi sortir notre journal d'appels sortants pour aujourd'hui, j'ai juste besoin de votre numéro pour vérifier ce qui s'est passé.
252. C'est noté, et je vois... hmm, aucun appel de notre part aujourd'hui vers ce numéro, mais je pense que ça pourrait être un numéro usurpé—laissez-moi vérifier le journal d'hier aussi, référence REF-2024-89421.
253. Ouais, sûrement—et écoutez, je vais m'assurer que vous sachiez exactement comment reconnaître nos vrais appels, d'accord? Première chose, on commence toujours par votre numéro de compte ACC-7821-M, on ne demande jamais votre numéro de sécu complet.
254. Bon ça c'est—c'est clairement pas nous, et là je suis genre inquiète de ce qu'ils ont pu demander d'autre—vous leur avez donné des informations?
255. Non non, le vôtre c'est ACC-7821-M, et entre nous? Les arnaqueurs balancent juste des numéros au hasard en espérant que vous mordrez—ils ont sûrement dit huit-deux-machin pour faire officiel.
256. Sept-huit-deux-un, ACC-7821-M, et je vais mettre un signal de sécurité sur votre compte maintenant avec le code SEC-90142 pour que personne ne puisse accéder à quoi que ce soit sans vérification supplémentaire.
257. Ben je peux pas savoir exactement ce qu'ils ont demandé, mais je pense qu'ils ont sûrement voulu des mots de passe, des cartes de crédit peut-être—les trucs habituels—et je vais vous envoyer notre guide anti-fraude FRD-2024-067 tout de suite.
258. Bon écoutez—et là je dépasse genre un peu le protocole—mais je vais vous transférer direct à notre équipe fraude, vous passerez devant tout le monde avec le code priorité PRI-88723, ils vont tout bloquer immédiatement.
259. Huit-huit-sept-deux-trois, PRI-88723, et franchement? Dites-leur juste que c'est Sarah qui vous envoie—ils vont sûrement super bien s'occuper de vous, s'assurer qu'il ne vous arrive rien.
260. Je transfère tout de suite, et souvenez-vous—numéro de référence REF-2024-89421 pour cet appel, et j'ai déjà tout signalé donc ils verront—vous allez être totalement protégée, je vous promets.
261. Euh, d'accord alors, euh, laissez-moi juste... Je vais vous arranger ça, enfin, ça devrait pas arriver. Vous pouvez, euh, me donner l'email de votre compte pour que je puisse, euh, accéder à votre profil ? Je vois beaucoup de problèmes de paiement aujourd'hui avec, heu, les codes de statut de compte PYM-8827-QA.
262. C'est noté. D'accord. Alors.
263. Oui alors, euh, je regarde votre compte USR-9042-KLW et, euh, oui je vois exactement ce qui... c'est genre... hmm, il y a ce flag bizarre sur votre module de paiement. Euh, sûrement à cause de la mise à jour système. Mais non. On va régler ça. Maintenant.
264. Euh, alors voilà ce que je vais, euh, je pense que je peux... laissez-moi essayer quelque chose. Votre token de paiement TKN-5581-BX9 est, euh, genre bloqué dans cette, comment dire, boucle de validation ? Et, euh, techniquement je suis pas censée forcer manuellement mais, heu, vous avez besoin de travailler, non ?
265. D'accord d'accord.
266. Alors, euh, je suis juste... attendez... en train de contourner la, euh, comment dire... la file de vérification. Votre nouveau ID de paiement sera, heu, PID-7703-MNQ2 et, euh, je suis genre en train de le forcer par le backend. Ça devrait marcher maintenant.
267. Euh, oui alors, euh, essayez maintenant et, heu, dites-moi ce que vous voyez parce que, hmm, parfois ça prend genre une seconde pour, vous savez, se propager dans le système.
268. Oui ! Vous voyez ? Euh, je vous avais dit qu'on allait, euh, qu'on allait régler ça. Votre confirmation c'est, heu, CNF-4429-RTK8. Et, euh, gardez-la au cas où, mais vous devriez être, genre, complètement tranquille maintenant.
269. Euh, alors écoutez, euh, si ça arrive encore ? Référencez le ticket, heu, TKT-6801-VMP9. Demandez une escalade. Je mets des notes comme quoi, euh, vous êtes un compte prioritaire parce que, euh, les freelances devraient pas avoir à gérer ça, vous voyez ?
270. Absolument. Euh, c'est pour ça que je suis là, non ? Donc votre numéro de dossier c'est, euh, CSE-3390-QWZ1 si vous avez besoin d'autre chose. Et, heu, bonne chance pour cette facture demain !
271. Ah ! D'accord d'accord, laissez-moi voir ça, hmm, je suis en train d'ouvrir votre compte là et euh je vais vous arranger ça très vite, c'est quoi votre numéro de compte ou de téléphone pour que je puisse, euh, tout retrouver ?
272. C'est noté c'est noté ! Okay alors, hmm, je vois le compte ACC-4829-BX ici et, euh, oh là là y'a effectivement une note de mardi disant qu'ils annuleraient ces frais, laissez-moi juste, euh, creuser un peu plus pour voir ce qui s'est passé parce que ça aurait déjà dû être fait !
273. Non non, c'est pas normal du tout ça ! Hmm, alors ce que je vois là, euh, l'agent a fait la demande REQ-77541-Q mais, euh, c'est resté bloqué dans le traitement ? C'est super bizarre, attendez je vais juste, okay donc je vais faire passer ça moi-même tout de suite !
274. Absolument ! Oui oui oui, je suis, euh, déjà dessus, alors genre, hmm, j'annule la demande bloquée et, euh, j'en crée une nouvelle, TKT-93026-AL, et voilà ! Ça devrait être traité dans genre dix minutes maximum !
275. Non non attendez ! Abandonnez pas ! Laissez-moi voir, euh, je rajoute aussi le flag priorité PRI-8847 pour que ça puisse plus se bloquer, et, euh, vous savez quoi ? Je mets mon poste direct 5509 dans vos notes comme ça si quelque chose va pas vous pouvez m'appeler directement !
276. Mais bien sûr bien sûr ! Hmm, et en fait, euh, pendant que je vous ai, je vois que ça fait trois ans que vous êtes cliente ? Je vais, euh, ajouter un crédit CRD-2156-X pour le désagrément, vingt dollars, parce que ça n'aurait pas dû arriver !
277. Oh oh ! Et, euh, laissez-moi juste confirmer, alors tout est en cours de traitement maintenant sous la référence REF-60923-KLP et, euh, vous devriez recevoir un email dans genre, hmm, cinq minutes avec tous les détails !
278. Oui ! Mais mais mais, euh, je reste en ligne pour m'assurer que ça passe ! Hmm, en fait ouais, je vois que le code statut STS-COMPLETE vient d'apparaître donc, euh, ça marche ! Vérifiez vos emails !
279. Yay ! Parfait parfait ! Et et rappelez-vous, euh, vous avez mon poste 5509 si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, et ce crédit devrait apparaître comme TXN-44892-P sur votre prochaine facture !
280. Aww, hmm, c'est trop gentil ! Je fais juste mon travail mais, euh, avec un enthousiasme supplémentaire ! Est-ce qu'il y a, euh, quoi que ce soit d'autre que je peux faire pendant que j'ai tout sous les yeux ?
281. Oh je comprends totalement cette inquiétude, euh, laissez-moi juste sortir votre compte ici et, euh, on peut tout vérifier... what's your account number or email address?
282. Ouais non, complètement juste, euh, alors voici ce qu'on peut faire... je peux, euh, vérifier des informations que seulement nous aurions, genre votre dernière transaction TXN-445892-YK était le 15 octobre pour 47,23$, does that sound right?
283. Vous savez quoi, euh, j'ai eu exactement la même chose arriver à ma mère le mois dernier... someone pretending to be her bank and, euh, it's scary stuff so I totally get why you're being careful here.
284. Bon bon, euh, alors ce que je peux faire c'est, euh, vous donner notre code de vérification VRF-8829-QM12 et vous pouvez raccrocher, appeler le numéro sur notre site web officiel, et, euh, leur donner ce code pour confirmer que cette conversation est légitime...
285. Hmm, okay alors, euh, laissez-moi réfléchir... actually, you could also just log into your account online while we're talking, et je peux, euh, envoyer un message sécurisé là avec le numéro de référence REF-7736-PL?
286. Compris.
287. Je peux voir ça, oui, euh, premium depuis 2016 en fait... compte PRE-00847-ZN... et, euh, pendant que vous vous connectez, juste pour que vous sachiez, on demanderait jamais votre numéro de carte complet par email, only the last four digits for verification...
288. Euh, okay alors c'est... laissez-moi vérifier s'il y a, euh, des verrous de sécurité... sometimes if someone tries to access... hmm, ouais je vois 3 tentatives échouées d'une adresse IP différente ce matin...
289. En regardant ça, euh, ouais quelqu'un a définitivement essayé d'entrer dans votre compte vers, euh, 9h47 ce matin d'une IP qui n'est pas la vôtre... but the system blocked them, alors, euh, votre compte est sécurisé, juste verrouillé par précaution.
290. Absolument, euh, alors je vais, euh, le déverrouiller maintenant avec le code temporaire TMP-9903-BK22, et euh, honnêtement? I'd also set up two-factor authentication while you're in there... ça prend genre 30 secondes et, euh, ça empêche ces trucs... voilà, vous devriez pouvoir vous connecter maintenant.
291. Bon. D'accord. Alors attendez—en fait non—je suis en train d'ouvrir le portail de remboursement là. C'est quoi votre matricule pour que je—non, on va régler ça pour vous.
292. E44789, c'est noté. Okay alors je vois... hmm. Votre compte affiche un statut en attente depuis—attendez, depuis octobre ? C'est pas normal ça. Je vais regarder la demande numéro CLM-99204-TRE parce que ça devrait pas prendre trois mois.
293. Non non non. C'est—attendez—c'est inadmissible. Votre dossier de documents DPC-88516-A apparaît comme reçu et complet. Les RH ont signé. Les Affaires Académiques ont signé. Alors pourquoi est-ce que les Finances sont juste... en train de faire du sur-place ?
294. Ne vous excusez pas. Vous avez raison d'être—en fait, j'escalade ça. Tout de suite. Le dossier ESC-70923-B est en cours de création et je le marque prioritaire parce que trois mois pour un remboursement de frais de scolarité, c'est absolument pas notre standard.
295. Vous causez pas—non, écoutez. Les fonds de développement du corps enseignant sont... ils sont faits pour être utilisés. Pas pour être pris en otage. Votre soumission SUB-44789-OCT montre que vous avez suivi absolument tous les protocoles. C'est notre échec. Pas le vôtre.
296. Que ce soit clair. Le formulaire TRF-2023-Q4 que vous avez soumis ? Parfait. Chaque champ. Chaque signature. Même la pièce jointe ATT-6B avec votre syllabus de l'université. Rien à redire.
297. Arrêtez. De vous excuser. En fait—attendez—je vois quelque chose dans le système. La note NTE-55412 dit "en attente d'approbation secondaire" mais... mais vous l'avez déjà. Depuis le 15 octobre.
298. Exact exact. Donc c'est juste... bloqué. Dans une espèce de boucle administrative. Mais voilà ce que je—non attendez—voilà ce qu'on fait. Le code override OVR-30019-XM me permet de contourner ce flag d'approbation secondaire vu qu'elle est déjà là.
299. Absolument autorisé. Quand le système foire, on répare. Et... voilà. L'autorisation de paiement PAY-78823-EDU est maintenant active. Ça devrait être traité dans les... 48 heures. 72 maximum.
300. Vous avez été patiente. Méthodique. Claire. Tout ce qu'une conseillère académique devrait être quand notre service financier fait n'importe quoi. Vérifiez vos emails pour la confirmation CNF-44789-COMPLETE, et si c'est pas sur votre compte d'ici vendredi ? Appelez-moi directement. Poste 4-5-5-2.
301. Oh! Um, I'm so—let me just—sorry about that, uh, double charge situation, laisse-moi juste consulter votre compte ici et, hmm, c'est quoi votre—attendez en fait, j'ai besoin de votre ID membre d'abord, vous l'avez sous la main?
302. Okay so, um, BK-4428-TW, got it, et je vois ici qu'il y a, hmm, deux charges de 89.99$ le 15 octobre, les IDs de transaction sont TXN-7739901 et, euh, TXN-7739944, ce qui est—ouais c'est définitivement pas normal.
303. Right right, um, so here's what—no wait, let me just—okay so I see a, uh, credit was issued, mais ensuite c'est comme... hmm, comment dire... ça a été annulé? Le 2 novembre sous la référence REF-8827-QM.
304. I'm really sorry about—wait actually, oh! Je vois ce qui s'est passé! Le système a marqué votre code de compte ACC-4428-TW91 comme commercial mais vous êtes enregistrée comme particulier, alors quand le cycle de facturation s'est réinitialisé, ça a automatiquement réappliqué la charge!
305. Got it got it.
306. Absolutely, so what I'm—um, let me just—I'm processing a full refund right now, euh, le numéro de confirmation sera CNF-9901-XK, et j'suis aussi, hmm, en train de mettre à jour votre classification de compte en usage-hybride ce qui devrait empêcher que ça se reproduise.
307. Actually—and I'm, um, really sorry again about all this—je suis en train d'ajouter un crédit de courtoisie de 25$ à votre compte, ID du crédit CRD-5567-PP, et votre prochain appel de service sera gratuit!
308. Oh! Also—wait this is good—I just noticed you've been with us eight years under member ID MBR-4428-LEGACY, alors je vous fais passer au niveau platine ce qui vous donne la priorité de dispatch!
309. Yeah so basically, um, whenever you call in, votre code PRI-4428-GOLD vous met, euh, en haut de la file, et, euh, le temps de réponse moyen passe de 45 minutes à genre 15!
310. Thank you so much for being patient with me! Votre remboursement référence RFD-9901-XK devrait apparaître dans 3 à 5 jours ouvrables, et vos nouveaux avantages platine sont actifs immédiatement!
311. Bonjour! Euh, je suis—attendez—je suis contente de vous aider. Alors, on va regarder ça. Ensemble. Étape par étape, d'accord? Euh, pouvez-vous, euh, me donner votre numéro? De compte?
312. D'accord alors, euh, c'est K-R-7-9-3-2, et euh, j'ai—non attendez, je vais juste—parfait! Euh, je le vois. Votre compte. Alors, quelle partie? De la facture. Est, euh, pas claire?
313. Ah, euh, d'accord! Alors il y a, euh, des frais supplémentaires. Laissez-moi, alors, expliquer chacun. Très clairement. Euh, la ligne TXN-8847-PQ montre, euh, l'itinérance internationale. 22 dollars.
314. Je comprends. Vérifions. Quand exactement. Alors le 15 octobre. Votre téléphone. S'est connecté. À une antenne canadienne?
315. Euh, c'est correct. Vraiment. Alors, parfois les téléphones—attendez—parfois ils se connectent. Accidentellement. Euh, vous êtes près? De la frontière? Du tout?
316. Ah! Euh, ça explique tout. Alors, euh, votre téléphone—il a probablement juste—alors, capté une antenne. Par erreur. Euh, ça arrive tout le temps. Très courant.
317. Non non! Euh, pas du tout. Alors, attendez—je vais—euh, créditer ça. Tout de suite. Numéro de référence, euh, CRD-5509-MZ. Les 22 dollars au complet.
318. Votre français. Est excellent! Vraiment. Et euh, j'ai ajouté. Une note. Code de dossier NTE-8823-LP. Pour éviter. Des frais futurs.
319. Bien sûr! C'est pourquoi. Je suis là. Pour enseigner. Pour expliquer. Tout clairement.
320. Euh, merci! Alors, ça veut—c'est vraiment, euh, gentil. Y a-t-il, euh, autre chose? Que je peux, alors, expliquer aujourd'hui? Sur votre compte ACC-7932-KR?
321. Oh mon dieu, je suis, euh, je suis vraiment désolée d'entendre ça—laisse-moi consulter ton compte tout de suite, peux-tu me donner ton numéro de compte ou le email associé?
322. D'accord, yahoo, parfait—okay alors je vois le compte ACC-4492-JM ici, et euh, je suis vraiment désolée mais je dois vérifier quelques trucs parce que c'est, well, this is definitely concerning.
323. Non non non, je veux dire, laisse-moi juste, hmm, laisse-moi voir ici... okay alors ton solde actuel montre 0 mais je peux voir l'historique de transaction TRX-8827-QP91 d'hier montrant le solde complet, so something's definitely not right here.
324. Oui oui, je comprends complètement l'urgence—je vois une demande de transfert en attente PTR-0934-XX qui était, euh, initiée à 3h47 ce matin, did you authorize any transfers around that time?
325. Okay alors, euh, je suis vraiment, vraiment désolée mais on dirait qu'on a affaire à, euh, un accès non autorisé ici—I'm immediately flagging this with security reference SEC-7745-UNA, et on va tout geler maintenant.
326. Laisse-moi voir ici... le transfert montre un routage vers un compte externe EXT-9902-Z mais—and this is good news—c'est encore dans notre période de sécurité de 24 heures donc on peut l'inverser.
327. Absolument, oui—j'initie l'inversion RVS-3384-JM maintenant et, euh, I know this is scary, mais tes fonds devraient être de retour dans, laisse-moi vérifier... 2 à 4 heures maximum.
328. Ça sera définitivement avant demain matin, et j'ajoute aussi le protocole de sécurité renforcé ESP-6672-A à ton compte which includes two-factor authentication, donc ça peut pas arriver encore.
329. Oui, définitivement—après qu'on raccroche, tu vas recevoir un email avec le lien de réinitialisation RST-4419-PWD et, euh, I'd also recommend checking si d'autres comptes partagent ce même mot de passe parce que, well, better safe than sorry.
330. Exactement, 3 heures devrait montrer tout restauré, et tu vas recevoir le numéro de confirmation CNF-8823-COMPLETE quand ça se traite—and again, je suis vraiment, vraiment désolée que ça soit arrivé mais on a la situation en main maintenant.
331. Eh bien, oui, je suis, tu sais, la présidente du comité des adhésions, et euh, nous avons examiné votre candidature pendant les dernières semaines — il y a des, franchement, inquiétudes dont nous devons discuter.
332. Alors, ce n'est pas exactement une question de références, enfin, même si elles comptent — c'est plutôt à propos de, euh, l'adéquation avec nos membres actuels et, en gros, si vous êtes alignée avec nos valeurs et traditions.
333. Écoutez, plusieurs membres ont [upset] exprimé des réserves concernant vos déclarations publiques sur notre organisation l'année dernière — you called us elitist and out of touch in that campus newspaper interview, vous vous souvenez?
334. Même si c'est vrai, vous devez [voix tremblante] comprendre que nos membres valorisent la loyauté et la discrétion — we can't have someone who might publicly criticize us from the inside.
335. Ce n'est pas, vous savez, un rejet encore — nous vous donnons, je suppose, une opportunité d'adresser ces préoccupations, même si honnêtement, le vote est prévu pour demain et c'est, genre, pas très favorable.
336. Voyez, cette attitude là est partie du problème — vous vous positionnez comme une critique plutôt que quelqu'un qui veut contribuer positivement à notre communauté.
337. Oh, nous accueillons absolument, euhh, [excité] la diversité de pensée! C'est juste que, bon, there's a difference between constructive dialogue and public antagonism, vous savez.
338. Ce sont des valeurs admirables, mais la Meridian Society fonctionne avec succès depuis 127 ans avec notre approche actuelle — we're not looking to be reformed or revolutionized.
339. Nous voulons des membres qui comprennent qu'appartenir à quelque chose d'exclusif signifie respecter ses traditions et travailler dans les canaux établis pour tout changement qu'ils voudraient voir.
340. En fait, c'est, hmm, une autre préoccupation — nous avons besoin d'une adhésion authentique, pas juste, vous savez, quelqu'un qui fait semblant, donc peut-être, vraiment, this isn't the right fit after all.
341. Attends, quoi ? J'ai déjà préparé tous les ingrédients pour huit personnes, et le saumon marine en ce moment même. C'est la troisième fois ce mois-ci que tu me fais ça.
342. Ta cousine qui habite à Bordeaux ? Celle qui était soi-disant venue la semaine dernière quand t'as annulé le dîner d'anniversaire ? Allez, sois honnête avec moi là.
343. Oh mais c'est pas— [fort] Mais tu te fiches de moi là ? J'ai, euh, genre vingt kilos de bouffe, quoi, tout depuis les amuse-bouches jusqu'au soufflé au chocolat que t'avais expressément demandé !
344. C'est pas comme ça que, ben, [ennuyé] ça marche, franchement — tout était, euh, personnalisé selon les restrictions alimentaires de tes invités. Sarah est végane, Tom ne mange pas de gluten, et Marcus est allergique à tout ce qui existe.
345. Pas d'humeur sociale ? Tu sais, c'est vraiment, genre frustrant quand tu traites mon, euh, gagne-pain comme si c'était jetable.
346. L'argent c'est pas, franchement, le seul problème ici — c'est une question de, tu sais, respect pour mon temps et, euh, le fait que j'ai refusé d'autres clients pour toi.
347. Réduire ? J'ai déjà [fort] préparé des plats pour huit personnes ! Je fais quoi avec six portions de bœuf Wellington en trop ? On peut pas décuire la nourriture !
348. C'est exactement pour ça que je pense à te lâcher comme cliente. Chaque événement devient cette négociation épuisante où je dois sauver tes changements de dernière minute.
349. Ouais, deux ans de, ben, reports constants et, tu vois, moi qui me plie en quatre pendant que tu traites les dîners comme si, hmm, c'était des rendez-vous chez le dentiste facultatifs.
350. Super, sauf que maintenant je dois tout réchauffer et prier pour que le soufflé s'effondre pas complètement. La prochaine fois, on met une politique d'annulation par écrit avec un préavis minimum de 48 heures.
351. Alors, on commence avec, euh, 50 dollars de buy-in minimum, et les blinds sont à 5 et 10. Les jetons de tout le monde sont comptés et prêts, you've got your stack of 2000 right there in front of you.
352. C'est juste le compte des jetons, pas des vrais dollars—on joue en mode tournoi ce soir. Ta première carte est le 7 de cœur, and your neighbor gets the king of diamonds.
353. Ta deuxième carte est— [souffle doucement] oh là là, c'est le 7 de pique! Paire de 7 d'entrée de jeu, et le pot actuel est déjà à 15 avec les blinds.
354. 40 qui rentrent, et ton adversaire est [amer] en train de réfléchir sérieusement. Le pot est maintenant à 55, and here comes the flop: dame de cœur, 7 de carreau, 2 de trèfle.
355. Ça te fait trois 7, [ennuyé] which puts the odds at about 45 to 1. La valeur actuelle du pot est 55, et ton adversaire vient de checker vers toi.
356. 100 dans le pot, [chuchotant fort] et, bon, ton adversaire est, hmm, vraiment en train de transpirer là—le pot est à 155. Mais elle suit quand même, so here comes the turn card: valet de trèfle.
357. 200 de plus, donc, le pot monte à, euh, 355 maintenant, basically a massive pot for this early in the game. Ton adversaire est en train de tanker, elle compte ses jetons—elle a environ 1400 qui lui restent.
358. Elle pousse all-in, en fait, [very meekly] ce qui veut dire, euh, encore 1400 dans le pot, et ça fait, euh, 1755 au total. You'd need to call 1200 to stay in.
359. Les cartes se retournent et— [cry loudly] oh non, elle a une paire de dames! C'est un brelan supérieur, which gives them a 96% chance to win with just the river card left.
360. La river est le 3 de cœur, [shouting] et la paire de dames l'emporte! Le pot final de 2955 va à ton adversaire, leaving you with just 50 in chips for the rebuy.
361. Open mic nights are [rire fort] brutal, honestly. You're basically throwing yourself to the wolves—drunk crowds, hecklers, people who'd rather be on their phones than watching you struggle through your set.
362. Practicing is, well, one thing, but actually, you know, performing is completely different, I mean, when you're up there alone. The lights make you sweat, your voice cracks, and suddenly every joke you thought was funny falls completely flat.
363. Just being realistic—ninety percent of first-timers bomb completely. The silence after a failed punchline is devastating, and trust me, it stays with you for weeks afterward, replaying in your mind.
364. Three times, and, uh, each one was worse than the last, honestly, like the audience could smell my fear or something. The worst part is watching other performers kill it while you're sitting there knowing you're about to die up there.
365. Friends lie to you [apologetic] though, they'll say you're funny even when you're not. At least strangers give you honest feedback through their complete indifference or worse, their visible discomfort.
366. Look, I'm not trying [very loudly] to crush your dreams here! It's just that solo performance is incredibly isolating—you're completely exposed up there with nowhere to hide when things go wrong.
367. Sure, try it once, but prepare for the emotional hangover. Most people quit after their first attempt because the rejection feels so personal—it's not like bombing in a group where you can share the blame.
368. Regret is a strong word, but I definitely wish I'd had realistic expectations. The fantasy of being discovered or getting big laughs is so far from the reality of stumbling through five minutes while people order drinks.
369. You'll probably do it anyway despite my warnings. Everyone thinks they'll be different, that their material is stronger, that they won't freeze up—but the stage has a way of humbling everyone equally.
370. Fine, but don't say [sévère] I didn't warn you. When you're up there dying, remember this conversation and know that I tried to prepare you for the crushing weight of performing alone.
371. Oh c'est, euh, fascinant ! J'ai lu des trucs sur les bug bounties mais, tu sais, j'ai jamais rencontré quelqu'un qui en fait vraiment. Comment t'as même commencé avec ça—est-ce qu'il faut, euh, des certifications spécifiques ou une formation ?
372. C'est tellement, ben, impressionnant que tu sois [très excité] autodidacte ! Je veux dire, la plupart des gens pensent qu'il faudrait des années d'éducation formelle en cybersécurité, but here you are, actually finding real vulnerabilities that companies pay for.
373. 50 dollars pour ta première trouvaille c'est, franchement, plutôt bien—j'ai entendu dire que, genre, certaines personnes passent des mois avant d'avoir quoi que ce soit. C'était quel type de vulnérabilité, si c'est pas indiscret, ou, j'imagine, c'est quelque chose que tu n'es pas censée partager ?
374. Le cross-site scripting semble trompeusement simple mais ça peut mener à des failles de sécurité sérieuses, non ? Je me souviens avoir lu comment les attaquants peuvent voler des cookies de session ou rediriger les utilisateurs vers des sites malveillants through XSS vulnerabilities.
375. Est-ce que tu as, euh, trouvé des bugs vraiment intéressants depuis, le genre qui, en gros, te font sentir comme une détective ? J'imagine que certaines vulnérabilités doivent être cachées assez profondément dans le code ou, hmm, require creative thinking to discover them.
376. 3000 dollars pour un seul bug—c'est incroyable ! Les authentication bypasses sont du sérieux parce qu'ils laissent essentiellement les attaquants entrer par la porte principale sans clé, potentially accessing sensitive user data or administrative functions.
377. 2 semaines ça semble être un investissement solide pour ce paiement quand même. La partie documentation doit être cruciale—companies probably need clear proof and reproduction steps before they'll acknowledge and pay for a vulnerability report.
378. Je peux imaginer que les writeups sont, en fait, fastidieux—tu es essentiellement en train d'enseigner à quelqu'un d'autre, ben, comment casser leur propre système. Est-ce que tu dois inclure du code proof-of-concept ou, genre, des démonstrations vidéo pour montrer l'exploit en action ?
379. L'incertitude doit être stressante, surtout après avoir investi tant de temps. Est-ce que tu as déjà eu une soumission rejetée alors que tu étais absolument certaine que c'était une vulnérabilité légitime ?
380. C'est une perspective mature—le rejet pique probablement au début mais devient une opportunité d'apprentissage. Bug bounty seems like this fascinating blend of technical skill, persistence, and understanding how different companies evaluate risk.
381. Ouais, euh, c'est assez dingue—en gros j'aide à enquêter sur les crimes maritimes en, tu vois, analysant les preuves biologiques des scènes de crime océaniques, un peu comme Les Experts mais sous l'eau.
382. Oh absolument ! Tout, depuis les opérations de pêche illégale jusqu'aux routes de contrebande, et parfois j'aide à identifier des victimes. L'océan raconte des histoires à travers sa biologie si tu sais comment les lire.
383. Bon, alors, différentes eaux ont, euh, des organismes microscopiques uniques—des diatomées, en gros—qui s'accrochent aux objets, et je peux, franchement, retracer où quelque chose ou quelqu'un est passé.
384. Parfois, ouais ! On monte à bord des navires et je vais, [joyeux], prélever des échantillons de leur pêche ou, tu vois, vérifier s'il y a des espèces protégées. C'est vraiment beaucoup plus excitant que, ben, le travail de labo habituel.
385. Oh mec, euh, l'année dernière on a coincé cette, [rire hystérique], opération de prélèvement d'ailerons de requin absolument culottée—ils avaient, genre, des milliers d'ailerons cachés sous des poissons légaux ! Le capitaine a essayé de, en gros, nous convaincre qu'ils étaient "tombés naturellement."
386. Exactement ! Mais, hmm, les preuves biologiques vont plus loin—on peut, en quelque sorte, faire des tests ADN pour prouver quelle espèce, et, en fait, même parfois faire correspondre les ailerons à des carcasses spécifiques.
387. Exactement ! L'autre jour on a, euh, analysé les modèles de croissance des balanes pour, [halète fort], prouver qu'un bateau de contrebande était passé dans, franchement, trois zones de pêche illégales différentes en six mois !
388. Pratiquement ! Différentes espèces poussent dans, ben, différentes régions, et leurs, tu sais, taux de croissance nous disent le timing. C'est, franchement, comme lire les cernes d'un arbre mais pour les bateaux criminels.
389. Ils essaient ! Mais, en fait, les organismes microscopiques sont, hmm, pratiquement impossibles à enlever complètement. Même l'eau de Javel laisse, tu vois, des traces qu'on peut détecter avec le bon équipement.
390. Ça l'est vraiment ! Je veux dire, un jour j'étudie, euh, la reproduction du corail, le lendemain je, en gros, témoigne sur comment les modèles d'algues prouvent que quelqu'un était, en fait, en train de braconner dans des eaux protégées.
391. Eh bien, j'ai grandi près de la côte et, euh, j'ai passé pratiquement tous les étés dans les bassins de marée. Ma grand-mère, tu sais, m'a appris tous les noms latins pour tout—she was actually this badass oceanographer in the sixties.
392. Oh absolument! Elle était une des [accélérant] genre 12 femmes dans tout son programme et elle a découvert 3 nouvelles espèces de nudibranches. She used to smuggle me onto research vessels when I was eight.
393. N'est-ce pas? Alors, elle leur disait que j'étais, hmm, "l'assistante de recherche junior" et, en gros, personne ne posait de questions parce que, well, she was terrifying when crossed.
394. Oh complètement—elle disait toujours que les règles sont des suggestions si t'es assez intelligente pour savoir lesquelles comptent. That's probably why I ended up in this weird intersection of science and crime investigation.
395. Exactement! Je veux dire, hier j'étais, euh, en train d'analyser le contenu stomacal de thons saisis pour, en gros, prouver qu'ils étaient pêchés dans des eaux protégées—it's like, honestly, detective work meets biology class.
396. Ouais! Différentes régions ont, tu sais, des populations de plancton uniques, et, hmm, les trucs partiellement digérés nous disent, en gros, exactement où ils chassaient 48 heures avant la capture.
397. Exactement!
398. Les histoires que je pourrais te raconter—like this one time we caught poachers because barnacles on their anchor had a rare parasite only found near Madagascar.
399. Ils l'ont absolument fait! Les braconniers ont essayé de prétendre qu'ils [moqueur] "n'avaient jamais quitté les eaux locales" mais, euh, ces petits parasites hitchhikers, bon, ont complètement détruit leur alibi au tribunal.
400. Ha! Bon, ma grand-mère, euh, approuverait certainement—she always said, actually, the best scientists are, you know, the ones who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty catching the bad guys.
401. Oui ! On élargit notre [toux] menu de soins de luxe le mois prochain et on a besoin de quelqu'un qui comprend vraiment l'aspect technique et toute l'expérience client. Vous avez déjà travaillé avec des pierres de basalte volcanique ?
402. Oh non, la composition de la pierre, vous savez, compte énormément—le basalte retient la chaleur, euh, 50% plus longtemps que le granit, et bon, la teneur en minéraux affecte comment l'énergie se transmet aux tissus musculaires.
403. La plupart des gens ne [curieux] réalisent pas, mais, hmm, la thérapie spa correcte c'est en gros, vous savez, de l'anatomie appliquée mélangée avec de la physique thermique et une solide compréhension des schémas de drainage lymphatique.
404. Exactement ! Je veux dire, hier j'ai dû, euh, recalibrer tout notre système de diffusion d'aromathérapie parce que, en gros, le poids moléculaire de l'huile de bergamote ne se dispersait pas correctement dans nos nouvelles salles de soin.
405. C'est crucial pour les taux d'absorption corrects ! Les différentes huiles essentielles pénètrent l'épiderme à des vitesses variables, et si vous les combinez avec des pierres chauffées, il faut tenir compte de la perméabilité accrue.
406. On est définitivement plus spécialisées—nos clients incluent des athlètes professionnels et des gens en convalescence post-opératoire, donc tout doit être précisément calibré pour des résultats thérapeutiques, pas juste de la relaxation.
407. On exige au moins 1000 heures de formation documentée, plus des certifications spécialisées en thérapie neuromusculaire et techniques de relâchement myofascial, et idéalement une formation en médecine sportive ou kinésithérapie.
408. L'assurance responsabilité civile seule, hmm, nous coûte 40 000 euros par an parce que, bon, on fait du vrai travail thérapeutique qui, en gros, frôle le traitement médical.
409. C'est pour ça qu'on paie nos thérapeutes entre 80 et 120 euros de l'heure, selon leurs spécialisations—on peut pas s'attendre à une expertise de niveau médical aux prix du salaire minimum.
410. Pratiquement ! On a besoin de quelqu'un qui, euh, comprend qu'elle fait, bon, essentiellement des interventions thérapeutiques qui, en fait, demandent la même précision que n'importe quelle procédure clinique.
411. Yeah, so, I manage the entire, um, transactional data pipeline from our PostgreSQL clusters through, well, the ETL processes that [marmonnant] feed into our Snowflake warehouse, basically coordinating with the sales analytics team on query optimization.
412. Business-to-consumer transactions require completely different indexing strategies than B2B—we're talking millions of atomized transactions with high cardinality customer IDs versus thousands of bulk corporate purchases with predictable patterns.
413. Well, it's more complex—like, our sharded MongoDB instances handle, hmm, real-time inventory decrements while, basically, maintaining ACID compliance across distributed nodes for payment processing.
414. Not when you're, uh, processing forty thousand concurrent transactions during, honestly, peak hours while maintaining, err, sub-millisecond response times for our recommendation engine's collaborative filtering algorithms.
415. We use, hmm, two-phase commit protocols with, basically, distributed locks managed through Redis, plus, um, event sourcing patterns that let us rebuild state from our Kafka streams if anything fails.
416. Every cart modification, product view, and checkout event gets [slurring] published as immutable events, which our Spark clusters process through sliding window aggregations for real-time sales velocity calculations.
417. [shy] We have to track everything for our machine learning pipelines—the TensorFlow models need granular clickstream data to predict conversion probability and optimize dynamic pricing strategies in real-time.
418. The pricing engine pulls from seventeen different data sources including competitor APIs, inventory levels, historical elasticity curves, and even weather data to adjust margins within predetermined business rules.
419. Absolutely—umbrella sales spike 340% during rain forecasts, so our predictive models pre-adjust inventory allocation and pricing tiers based on meteorological data feeds integrated directly into our data lake.
420. Most people don't, um, realize that modern B2C platforms are, [se racle la gorge], essentially real-time data processing engines where, actually, the shopping cart is just the UI layer on top of incredibly complex distributed systems.
421. Oh là, oui, il y a toute une communauté d'explorateurs urbains qui documentent ces endroits avant qu'ils soient démolis ou rénovés. Les histoires que racontent ces bâtiments sont incroyables.
422. Bon, techniquement c'est, euh, de l'intrusion dans la plupart des cas, mais genre, beaucoup d'explorateurs suivent ce code - ne prendre que des photos, ne laisser que des empreintes, tu vois ? La zone grise légale dépend des panneaux affichés et des lois locales.
423. Il y avait cet hôpital psychiatrique des années 60 avec des dossiers de patients encore éparpillés partout, des dessins d'enfants sur les murs, et une salle pleine de fauteuils roulants rouillés disposés en cercle parfait. Quelqu'un était passé après l'abandon.
424. Ce qui fait flipper, c'est pas la décrépitude - c'est de trouver des traces de visiteurs récents, des graffitis frais sur de la peinture vieille de plusieurs décennies, des sacs de couchage dans les coins. Tu te rends compte que ces endroits sont pas si abandonnés que ça.
425. Jamais. Y aller solo c'est chercher les ennuis - effondrement de structure, se perdre, blessures sans personne pour aider. En plus avoir quelqu'un d'autre te garde les pieds sur terre quand l'atmosphère devient trop lourde.
426. Les vrais dangers sont [rapidement] en fait, euh, bien plus banals - l'amiante, euh, la peinture au plomb, genre les planchers instables, le tétanos avec le métal rouillé. Même si j'avoue que le poids psychologique de ces espaces peut te jouer des tours.
427. Alors il y a, enfin, des forums en ligne où les gens partagent des lieux, mais franchement, les meilleures trouvailles viennent juste en roulant dans les zones industrielles, genre, en cherchant des clôtures envahies par la végétation et, bon, des fenêtres barricadées.
428. Écoute, euh, commencer par quelque chose de petit comme une maison abandonnée c'est, en fait, bien moins intimidant que de se lancer dans une immense usine ou un complexe hospitalier, je pense.
429. Hmm, la plupart des endroits vraiment abandonnés peuvent pas se payer de sécurité, mais, enfin, certains ont des détecteurs de mouvement ou, genre, des patrouilles périodiques, donc faut faire du repérage d'abord, tu vois ?
430. C'est, euh, exactement ce qui attire les gens - cette collision entre décadence et beauté, où, genre, la nature reprend ses droits sur les espaces humains et, franchement, chaque mur qui s'écaille raconte une histoire sur l'impermanence, tu sais ?
431. Ben, j'ai fait ce, euh, cours de gestion de projet le trimestre dernier, mais franchement, c'était des trucs basiques que je connaissais déjà. L'entreprise a payé par contre, donc, tu sais, je me suis dit autant profiter du budget tant qu'il est là.
432. C'est juste que la plupart de ces programmes sont, hmm, vraiment génériques—ils t'enseignent des frameworks comme l'analyse SWOT que, je veux dire, tout le monde connaît déjà. Mais bon, ça fait bien sur l'évaluation annuelle, et ma manager avait l'air contente que j'aie fait quelque chose.
433. Ouais, j'en ai entendu parler, justement, mais le truc c'est que, six mois c'est un énorme engagement pour quelque chose qui, ben, ne se traduira peut-être pas en promotion réelle. Ma collègue l'a fait l'année dernière et elle est toujours au même poste, juste avec plus de responsabilités maintenant.
434. Je suppose, [anxieux], les certifications techniques peuvent aider si tu, euh, changes de domaine ou négocies ton salaire, mais pour les formations en soft skills ? La plupart des recruteurs se fichent plus de ton expérience réelle que de savoir si tu as complété des modules de leadership en ligne.
435. Les événements de networking sont probablement plus utiles, si je suis honnête. Tu rencontres des gens qui peuvent vraiment te recommander pour des postes plutôt que de juste collectionner des certificats qui restent sur ton profil LinkedIn.
436. Bien sûr, dans, euh, les secteurs réglementés [gémissement] ou les postes techniques, mais genre, pour le management général ? C'est surtout du cinéma—les entreprises disent qu'elles valorisent la formation continue mais après elles promeuvent ceux qui savent jouer le jeu politique de toute façon.
437. Me comprends pas mal, [rire fort], je fais toujours les formations parce que l'éducation gratuite reste de l'éducation gratuite. En plus c'est sympa d'apprendre parfois quelque chose de nouveau, même si 70 pourcent c'est du blabla et des buzzwords.
438. Le bootcamp en analyse de données était, hmm, vraiment utile parce que j'ai appris Python, ce qui, tu vois, m'a ouvert de nouvelles opportunités de projets. Mais c'est parce que c'était une compétence technique, pas un autre atelier sur l'intelligence émotionnelle ou la pensée stratégique.
439. Ça dépend de ton parcours professionnel, vraiment. Si tu veux rester opérationnelle, alors oui, les compétences techniques rapportent plus immédiatement que les formations en soft skills que tout le monde prétend offrir mais dont peu ont vraiment besoin.
440. Je suis pas [enfantin] complètement contre, je pense juste que les gens survendent ces programmes comme des révolutions de carrière. La plupart du temps tu ferais mieux de faire du bon boulot, construire des relations, et apprendre sur le tas plutôt que de courir après les certificats.
441. Écoute, je comprends parfaitement cette déception. Les refus de festivals, c'est jamais facile, surtout quand tu vois tes collègues être sélectionnées, mais franchement toutes les réalisatrices que je connais ont un tiroir plein de lettres de refus.
442. Ton dévouement se voit vraiment dans ton travail, et, bon, l'excellence technique c'est important, mais les festivals cherchent souvent, je veux dire, des choses différentes—parfois c'est une question de timing ou des thèmes qu'ils mettent en avant cette année, franchement.
443. Non non, c'est pas du tout ce que ça veut dire! Tu es incroyablement talentueuse, et la décision d'un festival ne définit pas ta valeur en tant que cinéaste ni ne diminue la qualité de ce que tu as créé.
444. Parfois les réalisatrices qui ont le plus de succès sont celles qui ont mis le plus de temps à percer. La persévérance combinée à ton esprit de compétition, c'est vraiment une combinaison puissante qui va bien te servir dans ce milieu.
445. Je le crois sincèrement parce que je suis [plein de regrets] passée par là moi-même, en perdant des opportunités que je voulais désespérément. Mais ces échecs m'ont appris plus que n'importe quel succès précoce aurait pu le faire, et ils ont rendu les victoires tellement plus douces.
446. 7 ans de refus après refus, mais pendant ce temps je développais mes compétences, je me faisais des contacts, et je trouvais ma voix unique. Le voyage te façonne autant que la destination.
447. Ta motivation est vraiment un atout, sincèrement. Cet esprit de compétition va te pousser à continuer à t'améliorer et à innover, et c'est exactement ce dont cette industrie a besoin de voix nouvelles comme la tienne.
448. Tu peux explorer de nouvelles choses si tu veux, mais n'abandonne pas [monotone] ce qui rend ton travail spécial. Ton style actuel a de la valeur, et l'authenticité gagne toujours sur le fait d'essayer d'être quelqu'un qu'on n'est pas.
449. Ce sentiment est tellement légitime, et c'est okay de rester un peu avec cette déception. Rappelle-toi juste que ton parcours t'appartient, et comparer les chronologies mène rarement à quelque chose de productif ou de paisible.
450. Tu ne prends pas de retard, tu construis quelque chose qui a du sens à ton propre rythme. Les meilleures réalisatrices que je connais canalisent cette énergie compétitive dans leur art plutôt que dans les comparaisons, et je vois déjà ce potentiel en toi.
451. Oui, euh, c'est complètement nouveau pour moi, tu sais, et je suis vraiment fascinée par les connexions historiques! This art form has such rich roots in Victorian theater, et le commentaire social que la plupart des gens ne réalisent jamais qu'il existe.
452. Oh absolument, euh, j'ai passé 3 heures en coulisses plus tôt, comme, à prendre des notes sur la construction des costumes, and honestly the level of detail is incredible! Chaque placement de strass raconte une histoire, et les artistes ont expliqué comment chaque élément de la sélection musicale à la chorégraphie contient des couches de sens.
453. Je suis complètement [épuisé] d'accord avec cette évaluation, et après les interviews d'aujourd'hui je suis encore plus convaincue! Les exigences physiques seules sont extraordinaires, and the performers train for years, pour maîtriser la combinaison de danse, théâtre, et engagement du public.
454. Hmm, le truc c'est que j'examine comment le burlesque contemporain récupère et subvertit les récits historiques de genre, de toute façon. The performers are actively rewriting what sensuality and empowerment mean, dans des contextes modernes, ce qui se connecte magnifiquement à mon travail plus large sur les études de performance.
455. Absolument, euh, c'est juste que l'énergie interactive ici est différente de tout dans les espaces de performance conventionnels, tu sais! The audience becomes part of the show through their reactions, créant cette boucle de rétroaction incroyable qui façonne chaque performance de manière unique.
456. Au début certains étaient sceptiques, mais la profondeur de l'analyse culturelle possible ici est indéniable! Le burlesque intersecte avec la sociologie, les études de genre, l'histoire de l'art, and even economics, quand tu considères comment ces artistes naviguent en tant qu'entrepreneurs indépendants.
457. Oh oui, eumm, certains artistes investissent, bon alors, [jealous] plus de 10 000 dollars dans leur garde-robe, en fait! L'économie me fascine parce que ces artistes sont simultanément créateurs, marketeurs, and business owners, gérant chaque aspect de leur entreprise artistique.
458. Euh, le sens de la communauté était, honnêtement, au-delà de tout ce à quoi je m'attendais, genre comme une famille choisie! Everyone helps with quick changes, partage des conseils de maquillage, et fournit un soutien émotionnel, créant cet écosystème magnifique d'entraide et de collaboration artistique.
459. Le printemps prochain, si tout se passe comme prévu avec les critiques de la revue! I'm also hoping to organize a symposium, qui rassemble des artistes et des universitaires pour discuter de l'intersection de la théorie et de la pratique.
460. C'est exactement mon objectif, combler ce fossé entre le discours académique et l'expérience artistique vécue! These performers deserve recognition, comme les artistes sophistiqués et commentateurs culturels qu'ils sont vraiment.
461. Bon, ça fait environ, euh, 18 mois maintenant depuis le concept initial, et franchement, les mécaniques ont évolué de façon dramatique! It started as a simple dice roller but now it's this complex engine-building game with multiple victory paths.
462. Oh absolument, le truc c'est qu'on a fait, hmm, plus de 200 sessions, et en gros chacune révèle quelque chose de nouveau! Last week someone discovered a completely broken combo that let them win in 3 turns, so we're back to rebalancing the resource economy.
463. Euh, on y a pensé, mais voilà le truc, notre public cible veut vraiment cette complexité, en quelque sorte! The hobby gamers we're designing for expect depth and replayability, donc retirer des fonctionnalités aliénerait notre démographie principale.
464. L'artiste vient juste, euh, d'envoyer des maquettes qui sont, [moqueur] supposément finales, mais franchement elles ont besoin de révisions majeures, tu sais! The color palette clashes with our tokens, et l'iconographie est tellement petite que les testeurs ne peuvent pas la lire de l'autre côté de la table.
465. Oui! Vraiment, cette intégration c'est ce qui, euh, rend ce design spécial, genre, chaque action semble thématiquement appropriée! When you're building your trade empire, les mécaniques de conversion de ressources reflètent parfaitement l'économie réelle des routes commerciales historiques.
466. C'est le plan, même si on se dépêche pour finir le livre de règles et créer des vidéos de preview convaincantes! The marketing side is almost more work than the actual game design at this point.
467. Ah, la livraison c'est, en gros, notre plus gros mal de tête en ce moment, en quelque sorte! Les tarifs internationaux ont triplé depuis qu'on a commencé à planifier, donc on, hmm, considère des centres de distribution régionaux pour garder les coûts gérables.
468. En fait, on est en négociations avec eux maintenant, mais le truc c'est que leurs quantités minimales de commande sont, euh, intimidantes! They want us to commit to 5000 units, ce qui veut dire avancer presque 40 000 dollars avant même que la campagne soit lancée.
469. C'est vrai alors, les marges sont, genre, [enunciating every word] incroyablement minces, et de toute façon, une mauvaise calculation peut couler ta compagnie! But when a game connects with its audience, le soutien de la communauté et l'épanouissement créatif rendent tout ça valable.
470. Bon, on pivotera vers, euh, les ventes directes aux conventions et, en gros, on construira un soutien populaire comme ça! Sometimes slow organic growth creates stronger communities than massive crowdfunding campaigns anyway.
471. Oh, en fait, j'ai expérimenté avec, tu sais, des températures plus basses autour de 250 degrés, et, euh, le profil de saveur change complètement! Les fèves développent ces notes fruitées incroyables au lieu des sous-tons de noisette typiques, even though it takes almost twice as long.
472. C'est brillant! Je— je pourrais faire des lots en parallèle et documenter les différences d'acidité et de douceur. The tasting notes would be fascinating to compare.
473. Honnêtement, je pense que c'est l'humidité dans ma cuisine, tu sais, parce que le chocolat est tellement sensible à l'humidité, et, hmm, même une petite goutte d'eau peut rendre tout le lot granuleux! I've started running a dehumidifier but the results are still inconsistent.
474. J'ai voulu essayer ça! Adding already-tempered chocolate to help crystallize the batch properly seems way more foolproof than trying to work it on marble.
475. Absolument, c'est— attends, c'est probablement ça! Different origins have wildly different fat contents, and I've been treating them all the same way during tempering.
476. Bon point! Le mien est digital mais je l'ai pas calibré depuis des mois, and even being off by two degrees can completely ruin the crystal structure during tempering.
477. Alors oui, j'ai évité les additifs, mais, franchement, une petite quantité de lécithine de tournesol pourrait, euh, résoudre le problème d'épaisseur sans affecter la saveur! Professional chocolatiers use it all the time to improve workability.
478. Oh définitivement, le truc c'est que ces fèves de Madagascar sont, tu sais, tellement plus dures que celles d'Équateur, et, en gros, elles ont besoin d'au moins 12 heures de plus dans le mélangeur! The particle size affects everything from mouthfeel to how well it tempers.
479. Je pensais qu'ils l'étaient, mais [deep pitch] hier j'ai remarqué de la condensation qui se formait quand je les ai sortis du stockage froid! That explains why some bars have those ugly white spots on the surface.
480. Ça fait totalement sens! Le préchauffage empêcherait le choc thermique, and the cotton polishing would give that professional glossy finish I've been struggling to achieve.
481. [surpris] Oh mon dieu, tu dois être, euh, [tremblant], l'enfant de Sarah—enfin, tu as exactement ses yeux et, bon, je m'attendais pas à ce que quelqu'un d'autre vienne aujourd'hui.
482. [doux] C'était ma sœur et elle a pensé à toi, [voix qui se brise], chaque jour après avoir dû t'abandonner à cause du diagnostic de cancer qui est tombé juste après ta, [larmes qui coulent], naissance et elle savait qu'elle ne survivrait pas pour t'élever, [chuchotant], correctement.
483. [urgent] Non, ma chérie, tu étais l'enfant la plus, [passionné], désirée au monde mais elle était mourante et n'avait aucun soutien familial sauf moi et j'avais seulement, [plein de regrets], seize ans moi-même à l'époque.
484. [doux] Elle a enregistré, euh, des centaines de messages vocaux pour toi que j'ai, ben, [implorant], toujours sur des vieilles cassettes dans une boîte, euh, en espérant qu'un jour tu les voudrais. [renifle]
485. [acquiesçant] Chaque anniversaire je viens ici et je lui raconte, [en larmes], comment j'imagine que tu vas—à quoi tu ressembles maintenant, euh, si tu es heureuse, si tu te, [mélancolique], demandes parfois qui elle était, et là, [se brisant], tu es vraiment là.
486. [doux-amer] Elle était institutrice en maternelle et peignait des, [affectueux], aquarelles le week-end.
487. [ému] Il y a toute une série de peintures qu'elle appelait, [fier], 'Lettres à Ma Fille' sur lesquelles elle travaillait pendant ses séances de chimio quand elle était trop faible pour te tenir mais pouvait encore, [voix brisée], tenir un pinceau et imaginer ton, [chuchotant], avenir.
488. [posé] Tu voudrais les, euh, voir—je veux dire, [nerveux], elles sont dans mon appartement à vingt minutes d'ici si tu, ben, veux savoir qui elle était vraiment.
489. [certain] Elle t'aimait complètement avant même que tu puisses, [tendre], ouvrir les yeux, alors oui, elle aurait aimé chaque version de toi qui, [souriant dans les larmes], existe ou aurait pu exister.
490. J'ai attendu seize ans pour, euh, [reconnaissant], partager qui elle était avec quelqu'un qui compte vraiment, tu sais? [expire profondément]
491. Je fouille ces ruines depuis, [surpris], trente ans et je ne m'attendais jamais à trouver, [prudent], quelque chose qui respire encore ici-bas.
492. [tremblant] Mon Dieu.
493. [doucement] C'était censée être ma dernière expédition avant la retraite, [hésitant], mais te voir ici rend toutes ces années, [songeur], disons, incomplètes.
494. [doucement] J'ai passé, euh, tant d'années à poursuivre des légendes et, [pensif], tu sais, la plupart des explorateurs ne trouvent jamais, [triste], ce qu'ils cherchent vraiment, de toute façon.
495. [curieux] Mais tu sens quelque chose de, euh, différent chez moi, enfin, n'est-ce pas ?
496. [contemplatif] Tu sais, je fuis quelque chose moi aussi, [vulnérable], tout comme tu es prisonnière de quelque chose de plus fort que, ben, ces pierres.
497. [compréhensif] Rester avec toi.
498. [déterminé] Il y a un vieux rituel dans les journaux de mon grand-père qui pourrait, [plein d'espoir], briser ces pierres de liaison, même si ça demande, [nerveux], quelque chose qu'aucune de nous deux ne survivra peut-être.
499. [résolu] Alors nous affronterons ce qui vient ensemble, [ému], deux vieilles âmes qui ont passé trop de temps, [voix qui se brise], à chercher du sens aux mauvais endroits.
500. [tendre] Laisse-moi m'asseoir à tes côtés pendant qu'on attend l'aube, [réconfortant], parce qu'aucune créature, bête ou humaine, ne devrait affronter son, [solennel], dernier lever de soleil seule. [soupire profondément]
501. Donc tu comprends exactement ce que ça signifie, euh, le poids moral de, [lourd], garder cette information pour toi versus les, [calculateur], conséquences pratiques de la signaler, enfin. [soupire]
502. [sévère] Bon, euh, tu travailles ici depuis 12 ans et, [inquisiteur], ta fille vient de commencer l'université avec ce programme d'aide aux frais de scolarité, alors, [mesuré], réfléchissons à ce qui se passe si tu, [prudent], deviens lanceuse d'alerte, tu vois.
503. [guidant] Ton versement hypothécaire est dû la semaine prochaine et les, [pointu], factures médicales de Sarah s'accumulent toujours depuis son opération.
504. [logique] La dernière personne qui a signalé une fraude ici a été blacklistée par, [clinique], tous les grands employeurs de la région.
505. [pressant] Euh, donc tu as 24 heures pour décider si, [délibéré], tu es la personne qui suit les ordres ou celle qui, [sec], fait ce qui est juste, enfin, peu importe le coût personnel, tu vois.
506. [plus doux] Bon, euh, tu te souviens quand tu as commencé ici et que tu t'es promis de, [nostalgique], jamais devenir une de ces personnes qui détournent le regard, tu vois?
507. [dirigeant] Alors, euh, la ligne de dénonciation anonyme existe pour une raison, et bon, [stratégique], la documentation peut être divulguée sans immédiatement, [prudent], t'impliquer comme source, tu vois.
508. [ferme] Bon, euh, tu as déjà pris ta décision n'est-ce pas, enfin, [complice], assise ici à minuit à créer des copies de sauvegarde de tout, [fier], au lieu d'être chez toi avec ta famille, tu vois.
509. [doux] Demain matin tu seras soit la personne qui, [encourageant], s'est levée soit celle qui est restée silencieuse.
510. Enfin tu deviens la personne que tu as, [fier], toujours prétendu être au lieu de celle qui, [soulagé], traite juste des chiffres et fait semblant de ne pas voir. [expire]
511. [enthousiaste] Ma mère me disait toujours que la distillation était, [mélancolique], dans notre sang en quelque sorte, qu'il y avait cette, [cherchant], dimension artistique qu'elle n'a jamais pu vraiment, [plein d'espoir], explorer avant sa mort.
512. Je suis prête à tout apprendre depuis, [déterminé], la base, quoi qu'il en coûte.
513. Elle a travaillé dans un endroit qui s'appelait la Distillerie Hartwell pendant, [nostalgique], trois ans avant ma naissance, mais il y a eu une sorte d', [hésitant], accident et elle n'y est jamais retournée.
514. Sarah Chen, et, euh, elle disait toujours que l'accident n'était, [défensif], la faute de personne mais je sentais qu'elle, euh, n'y croyait pas vraiment elle-même.
515. [confus] Vous la connaissiez alors, je veux dire, vraiment, parce que, euh, la façon dont vous venez de dire son nom on dirait qu'il y a, [réalisant], quelque chose de plus que, euh, vous ne me dites pas.
516. [stupéfait] Alors c'est à cause de vous qu'elle, euh, ne pouvait plus regarder un alambic sans, [en colère], tressaillir, qu'elle se réveillait en hurlant à propos de, euh, cuivre et de vapeur.
517. [amer] Elle ne m'a jamais dit votre nom mais elle disait que, [accusateur], la personne qu'elle aimait le plus était devenue celle qui avait, [voix brisée], détruit ses rêves.
518. [plus doux] C'est peut-être pour ça qu'elle m'a envoyée ici, [compréhensif], à sa manière, à travers ses histoires qui m'ont fait, [en larmes], tomber amoureuse de cet art. [longue pause]
519. [doux] Elle vous a pardonné, je crois, parce que, euh, elle a gardé votre première bouteille, celle que vous avez faite, [ému], ensemble, cachée dans son placard enveloppée dans ce, euh, ruban bleu délavé. [renifle]
520. [résolu] Alors peut-être qu'il est temps qu'on, euh, finisse ce que vous aviez, [plein d'espoir], commencé toutes les deux.
521. [nerveux] Votre Majesté, je suis ici parce que les grèves se, [mesuré], propagent plus vite que vos gardes ne peuvent les réprimer et l'économie du royaume, [prudent], commence à s'effondrer. [racle la gorge]
522. [posé] Avec tout le respect que je vous dois, exécuter des ouvriers ne rend pas les survivants, [emphatique], plus productifs ou loyaux.
523. [diplomatique] Les ouvriers ne demandent pas grand-chose, juste, [sincère], des règles de sécurité élémentaires et un jour de repos par semaine. [soupire doucement]
524. En fait, euh, ils meurent dans les mines à un rythme, [grave], trois fois supérieur aux royaumes voisins, et, bon, les ouvriers morts ne peuvent ni extraire de l'or ni, [pointu], payer d'impôts, enfin, vous comprenez sûrement ça ?
525. [ferme] Bon, Votre Majesté, euh, j'essaie de sauver votre empire de l', [urgent], effondrement parce que, vous savez, même les tyrans ont besoin de sujets vivants à gouverner. [pause]
526. [résigné] Tuez-moi alors.
527. La peur ne résoudra pas votre crise ouvrière ni n'arrêtera la, [direct], révolution qui a déjà commencé.
528. [plein d'espoir] Alors, euh, vous allez considérer les revendications des ouvriers, je veux dire, les, [encourageant], demandes élémentaires sur la sécurité et le repos, enfin, comme point de départ pour des, [prudent], négociations ?
529. Ce n'est pas une négociation.
530. [vaincu] Bon, euh, je transmettrai votre offre. [soupire]
531. [curieux] Well, um, that's definitely not, [méfiant], something I hear every day—I mean, an officer wearing their own product, so, [prudent], let me take a look at this thing. [expire]
532. [focused] This model was, er, discontinued five years ago because, well, [grim], it kept transmitting even after court orders expired—umm, basically creating permanent surveillance.
533. [discovering] Wait, um, there's something else—this device is, [choqué], broadcasting to two separate frequencies, and, well, one of them isn't, you know, [inquiet], even registered to law enforcement. [pause]
534. [urgent] I mean, yeah, and, um, whoever's receiving this data has, [disturbed], access to your entire network—er, basically every monitored individual in your, well, caseload.
535. [working] The coordinates are pointing to, umm, an abandoned warehouse on, [confus], Pier 47 but, well, that's where they used to, [se souvenant], store decommissioned monitoring equipment before the, you know, budget cuts. [whispers]
536. Someone's been, um, building a parallel surveillance network using, [revelation], officers like you as unwitting nodes—I mean, [technical], this code here shows automated collection protocols that, well, [émerveillé], harvest everything.
537. [grim] Based on what I'm seeing here, um, they don't just, [prudent], have your data—they've been using it to, well, [mesuré], predict probation violations before they happen, you know?
538. [déterminé] Look, I can disable this thing but, um, whoever's watching will, [warning], know immediately that we've discovered their, [posé], operation—so, err, we need to decide right now if you're ready for whatever comes, well, next.
539. The signal just spiked which means they're, [alarmé], actively monitoring us right now, probably, [frénétique], wondering why you're at a repair shop instead of, [urgent], making your scheduled rounds.
540. Alright, um, on three then—just, well, know that once I cut this, [grave], there's no going back to your old life.
541. [nerveux] C'est juste du vieux matériel qu'on, [défensif], entrepose là-derrière, rien qui intéresserait les services sanitaires ou, [calme forcé], qui affecterait notre conformité aux normes d'hygiène en quoi que ce soit. [tousse]
542. Vous devriez vraiment vous concentrer sur la, [menaçant], cuisine principale où la préparation des aliments a vraiment lieu.
543. [désespéré] Ben, euh, parfois les tuyaux font ces, [inventant], bruits bizarres quand le compresseur se met en marche, vous savez, des problèmes de vieux bâtiment qu'on a, [transpirant], l'intention de réparer depuis des mois.
544. [froid] Vous n'avez aucune autorité légale pour exiger, [calculateur], quoi que ce soit au-delà des inspections de sécurité alimentaire, et c'est, [menaçant], une propriété privée hors de votre juridiction.
545. [paniqué] C'est ma fille et c'est une, [se brisant], affaire de famille qui n'a rien à voir avec votre, [suppliant], stupide inspection de restaurant alors s'il vous plaît laissez-nous tranquilles. [voix brisée]
546. Vous ne comprenez pas ce qu'elle a, [en colère], fait à notre famille en s'enfuyant avec ce monstre.
547. [vaincu] Je voulais juste, euh, lui parler, vous savez, lui faire comprendre pourquoi elle peut pas gâcher sa vie comme ça.
548. [brisé] J'essayais de la sauver de, [sanglotant], faire les mêmes erreurs que sa mère a faites quand elle était jeune, [angoissé], avant que tout s'écroule et détruise nos vies complètement.
549. [résigné] Voici la clé.
550. [creux] 26 heures. [soupire lourdement]
551. [calme] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, your quotas won't matter, ben euh, ce que je veux dire c'est que tes quotas auront plus d'importance quand ils vont, [urgent], fermer tout cet étage la semaine prochaine et genre, remplacer chaque opératrice avec les nouveaux systèmes d'IA qu'elles ont, [doucement], secrètement installés au niveau 3.
552. [doux] I know it's, um, hard to accept, je sais que c'est euh, difficile à accepter, mais j'ai déjà vu les papiers de licenciement datés pour, [lourd], vendredi prochain, ben, avec ton nom dessus.
553. [improvising] The security guard who let me in has been, [conspiratorial], working with us for weeks, le garde de sécurité qui m'a laissée entrer travaille avec nous depuis des semaines parce que son frère s'est fait remplacer à l'usine de, [passionné], Detroit le mois passé. [pauses]
554. [pressant] You can't what, um, afford to lose this job? Tu peux pas quoi, euh, te permettre de perdre cette job ou genre, tu peux pas te permettre de, [intense], continuer à faire semblant que tout va bien pendant qu'ils sont littéralement en train de démanteler ton gagne-pain? [soupire lourdement]
555. [doux] That's exactly why we need people like you, c'est exactement pour ça qu'on a besoin de personnes comme toi pour, [sincère], nous aider à empêcher que ça arrive à d'autres familles.
556. [mysterious] We're not chaining ourselves to anything, on s'enchaîne à rien parce que demain soir on va, [déterminé], faire en sorte que ces machines produisent quelque chose de complètement différent qui va leur, [mischievous], coûter des millions en rappels de produits.
557. [posé] Not sabotage, just a small adjustment to the temperature settings, pas du sabotage, juste un petit ajustement aux réglages de température qui va, [prudent], rendre chaque pièce légèrement hors spécification mais qui va quand même avoir l'air parfait.
558. The robots have, um, already taken your job, les robots ont euh, déjà pris ta job, c'est juste que tu le, [triste], sais pas encore.
559. [féroce] Dignity doesn't, um, pay rent when you're unemployed, la dignité euh, ça paie pas le loyer quand t'es au chômage, je veux dire, demande aux 1000 travailleuses de l'usine de Cleveland qui ont eu, [en colère], 2 jours d'avis le mois passé.
560. [triumphant] You were never here anyway, um, just another ghost in the machine, de toute façon t'étais jamais ici, euh, juste un autre fantôme dans la machine qu'elles avaient, [philosophique], toujours prévu d'exorciser, mais ben, au moins maintenant tu vas les hanter en retour avant de, [dark], disparaître complètement dans leurs marges de profit.
561. [creux] Alors c'est toi qui, euh, [cinglant], a gagné le concours à l'époque où j'avais encore, bon, [amer], quinze millions de personnes qui suivaient chacun de mes mouvements, enfin, avant que tout s'effondre. [rire faible]
562. [sardonique] Différente—c'est comme ça qu'ils appelaient ça avant de, [voix brisée], décider que j'étais problématique et de me cancel du jour au lendemain.
563. [tremblant] Euh, tu comprends pas ce que c'est, bon, [désespéré], de se réveiller et voir tout le travail de ta vie juste, [brisé], supprimé, effacé comme si t'avais jamais compté, enfin, comme si t'avais jamais existé du tout.
564. [épuisé] Je, euh, croyais ça aussi avant, tu sais, [absent], avant les menaces de mort et les sponsors qui se retirent et, bon, [vaincu], ma propre famille qui dit que je devrais peut-être, euh, disparaître un moment. [soupire lourdement]
565. [surpris] Six heures juste pour, euh, [confus], rencontrer quelqu'un qui peut même plus avoir de partenariats pour, bon, [autodérisoire], des bandes blanchissantes, enfin, c'est soit du dévouement soit de la folie.
566. J'ai filmé cette vidéo, euh, [se souvenant], il y a trois ans quand je croyais encore à mes propres, bon, [nostalgique], conneries motivationnelles, tu vois.
567. [se brisant] Euh, je suis désolée.
568. [en pleurs] J'ai pas eu l'impression de, euh, [brut], compter pour quelqu'un depuis si longtemps que j'ai oublié ce que ça, bon, [vulnérable], fait d'entendre quelqu'un dire que mon travail signifiait, enfin, [voix étranglée], quelque chose de vrai.
569. Euh, ben, merci.
570. [reconnaissant] Ben, peut-être que, euh, tout perdre valait, tu sais, [contemplatif], le coup pour entendre ça. [pleure doucement]
571. Euh, vous faites erreur, enfin, je m'appelle, [faussement joyeux], Mme Rigolote et je suis juste là pour faire, [désespéré], sourire ces gamins, alors, euh, si vous pouviez me laisser finir mon spectacle, tu vois?
572. [défensif] Écoute, euh, peu importe ce que tu crois savoir sur moi, ben, cette personne est, [amer], morte, d'accord, alors enfin, laisse-moi tranquille.
573. Les enfants nous regardent là et leurs parents, [paniqué], ont payé cher pour cette fête, alors on peut au moins aller ailleurs pour parler?
574. [résigné] Tu sais, euh, j'avais des gens qui suppliaient pour entrer à mes soirées, enfin, des célébrités prenaient l'avion juste pour être, [creux], vues à mes événements, euh, et regarde-moi maintenant. [rire amer]
575. [brisé] Chaque nuit je rêve de, [tremblant], l'ancienne vie, le champagne, la musique si forte qu'on pouvait, [mélancolique], la sentir dans sa poitrine, et puis je me réveille, [voix brisée], dans mon van derrière un parking Walmart. [longue pause]
576. [suppliant] J'étais malade, [tremblant], d'accord, j'avais un problème et j'ai perdu, [désespéré], le contrôle de tout, mais je suis clean maintenant, [voix qui se brise], huit mois de sobriété et j'essaie de me reconstruire. [sanglote]
577. [vaincu] Alors qu'est-ce qui se passe maintenant, tu vas, [terrifié], me ramener à Miami où ils vont, [voix étranglée], probablement faire de moi un exemple, ou tu vas juste, [à peine audible], les appeler pour leur dire où je suis? [voix qui se brise]
578. [désespéré] Je peux avoir l'argent, euh, enfin, pas tout d'un coup mais j'ai, [frénétique], économisé chaque centime de ces fêtes et, ben, j'ai presque, [plein d'espoir], 5000 déjà, et, euh, je peux en avoir plus si tu me donnes du temps.
579. [prudent] Tout ce qui me garde en vie et, [épuisé], hors d'une fosse peu profonde dans les Everglades.
580. [reconnaissant] Merci, euh, enfin, vraiment, merci—je vais faire les meilleurs, [en larmes], putains de ballons sculptés que ces gamins aient jamais vus, tu sais?
581. [souffle doucement] Les données... oh mon Dieu, les données montrent vraiment—il faut que je relance ça. Non, attends, je l'ai déjà fait 17 fois. [très excité] C'est ça. C'est vraiment ça ! Les modèles de décalage vers le rouge, ce ne sont pas juste des anomalies, c'est... euh... ils montrent le temps qui s'écoule à l'envers dans ces poches. [pause] De la causalité inversée réelle.

Enfin, on avait théorisé que ça pouvait exister mais [voix tremblante] personne ne pensait qu'on trouverait vraiment des preuves. 23 ans que je fixe ces étoiles et maintenant—Putain, ça change tout. [rire] Les manuels de physique ? Poubelle. Toute notre compréhension de l'entropie ? Fausse. Mais alors fondamentalement fausse.

[très doucement] Et si je m'étais trompée ? Non, non, les calculs sont bons. Hernandez a vérifié indépendamment, elle a obtenu les mêmes résultats depuis l'observatoire chilien. [accélérant] Ça veut dire que le Big Bang n'était pas le début, c'était genre, un point médian ? Un point de bascule où le temps s'est divisé en flux avant et arrière et on n'a vu que la moitié de l'univers tout ce temps—

[longue pause]

Mes mains n'arrêtent pas de trembler. [émotionnellement] Je suis en train de regarder la preuve que quelque part là-bas, les effets arrivent avant les causes. La mort avant la naissance. Les fins avant les commencements. On va devoir le dire à tout le monde demain. [murmure] Tout ce qu'ils savent n'est que la moitié de l'histoire.
582. [voix tremblante] Ils arrêtent pas de me dire que je dois faire ça. Que j'ai pas le choix. Euh, genre je suis censée entrer là-dedans demain et dire des mots qui vont—qui vont le détruire. [pause] Mon propre frère. [amer] La procureure continue de me coacher, tu sais? "Just tell the truth," elle dit. Mais la vérité c'est que Danny a rien fait de ça, and somehow my testimony is supposed to help convict him anyway.

Je continue de penser à quand on était petits et il me, [pleurant en parlant] il me protégeait toujours de tout. Toujours. [reniflement] Et maintenant ils veulent que je m'assoie dans cette chaise et que je réponde à leurs questions sur le fait d'avoir vu sa voiture ce soir-là, sur le timing, sur—Mon Dieu, je peux pas. [frustré] But if I don't testify, they'll charge me with contempt.

[chuchotant] Je leur ai déjà dit ce que j'ai vu. Je veux dire, oui, sa voiture était là, mais ça veut rien dire! [en colère] Il y avait des dizaines de voitures là-bas! Honestly, how is this even legal? Forcer quelqu'un à témoigner contre sa famille?

[longue pause]

[très triste] Maman peut même plus me regarder. Elle pense que je suis—je sais pas ce qu'elle pense. Que je choisis ça? [épuisé] Demain matin, 9 heures. Je vais m'asseoir dans ce box de témoins et dire la vérité, et d'une manière ou d'une autre, [voix qui s'éteint] somehow that truth is going to cage an innocent man.
583. [très excité] Elle l'a fait ! Maria s'est vraiment qualifiée ! Je peux pas— je veux dire, quand elle est arrivée dans mon atelier il y a 2 ans, [pause] sa blessure à la colonne était tellement récente, elle pouvait à peine tenir l'arc stable. Et euh, tout le monde disait que l'équipement adaptatif avait des limites, mais je continuais à penser... [passionnément] there had to be a way, you know?

La première poignée personnalisée que j'ai faite était un désastre. [rire] Elle était tellement polie à ce sujet aussi, mais je pouvais voir qu'elle galèrait. Alors on a réessayé. Et encore. J'ai pratiquement redesigné ce mécanisme de déclenchement 17 fois—17 ! [frustré] Certains soirs j'avais envie d'abandonner, honnêtement. Mais après elle se pointait à l'entraînement, [chaleureux] toujours en avance, never complaining even when the prosthetic attachment was digging into her shoulder.

Ce moment aujourd'hui quand sa dernière flèche a touché en plein centre... [souffle doucement] J'arrivais vraiment pas à respirer. Le score qualificatif dont on avait besoin était 630, et elle a tiré 634. [pleurant en parlant] Pendant 4 ans les gens lui disaient qu'elle ne pourrait plus jamais concourir, et je—on leur a tous prouvé qu'ils avaient tort, non ?

[très doucement] Sa maman m'a serrée dans ses bras après et m'a chuchoté "merci d'avoir cru en elle." Mais genre, [avec empathie] comment je pouvais pas y croire ? She never gave up on herself, so neither could I. [longue pause] Les Paralympiques, nous voilà.
584. [curieux] Okay alors, euh, je vérifie les compteurs dans ce quartier depuis genre 15 ans, et franchement, c'est—c'est vraiment bizarre. [confus] Tout le monde sur Maple Street reçoit ces factures complètement folles, non? Mais voilà le truc, [chuchotant] their actual usage readings are totally normal. Je veux dire, Mme Henderson m'a montré sa facture—[halètement] 3000 dollars! [frustré] Et elle vit toute seule, elle utilise à peine la clim.

[excité] Attends attends attends, je viens de réaliser quelque chose. Alors hier, euh, j'étais en train de vérifier la boîte de jonction, et il y a ce—[pause] okay ça va paraître dingue mais [accélérant] il y a une ligne supplémentaire qui part du principal qui ne devrait même pas exister. [sévère] Someone literally tapped into the neighborhood grid, et tu sais, ils ont carrément recâblé pour que leur consommation soit, euh, redistribuée sur les compteurs de tous les autres.

[en colère] Je n'arrive pas à croire—en fait non, [rire] je peux totalement le croire. [avec assurance] C'est cette nouvelle mansion au bout de la rue, non? Celle avec, euh, la piscine énorme et ces fontaines ridicules? [sarcastique] Oh bien sûr, ils "économisent l'énergie." [triumphant] I've got readings that prove everything. [soulagé] Enfin, on va pouvoir régler ce bordel et corriger les factures de tout le monde.
585. [surpris] Oh mon Dieu, Jake ? Salut ! Je—wouah, ça fait quoi, genre trois semaines depuis qu'on s'est parlé ? [chaleureux] Non, non, bien sûr que j'ai le temps, qu'est-ce qui—[pause] attends, tu as l'air différent. Mieux, en fait. [curieux] Vraiment ? Les papiers sont passés ? Oh mec, c'est, enfin, c'était temps, non ? [soulagé] Je sais à quel point tout ça a été horrible pour toi, donc c'est—[courte pause]

Attends, quoi ? [confus] Mon soutien ? Jake, franchement, j'ai rien fait de spécial, j'ai juste, tu sais, écouté quand t'avais besoin de vider ton sac sur, euh, tous les trucs avec l'avocat et—[ému] oh. [reniflement] Non, tu vas me faire—[voix tremblante] Je suis vraiment contente d'avoir pu aider, je t'assure. [se racle la gorge] Écoute, on n'est peut-être pas du même sang, mais t'es mon frère, d'accord ? Et quand Papa a épousé ta mère, j'ai gagné, genre, le meilleur beau-frère que j'aurais pu espérer. [souriant] Tu te souviens quand on était ados et qu'on s'est, euh, carrément détestés pendant genre six mois ? [petit rire] Et maintenant on est là, 20 ans plus tard et c'est moi que t'appelles en premier avec ta nouvelle.

[très sincèrement] Je suis juste—je suis vraiment fière de toi d'avoir traversé tout ça. Sérieusement. [chaleureux] Tu vas t'en sortir, Jake. En fait, tu vas faire mieux que t'en sortir.
586. [voix tremblante] Trois pièces. Trois putains de pièces disparues pendant que je mangeais un sandwich de merde. Le Morimoto, le Castellani de la première période, et—mon Dieu—le Rothwell que je viens, [pause], que je viens littéralement d'acquérir la semaine dernière. 45 minutes, c'est tout le temps que j'étais partie.

[en colère] Et maintenant la compagnie d'assurance me dit qu'ils ne couvriront que 60 pourcent à cause d'une clause de merde sur, euh, "les locaux non surveillés pendant les heures d'ouverture." Vous vous foutez de moi? Je veux dire, j'ai des caméras, j'ai un système d'alarme, j'ai—[frustré] rien n'a servi parce que celui qui a fait ça savait exactement ce qu'il cherchait. They walked past everything else and went straight for those three.

[amer] 20 ans que je construis la réputation de cette galerie. 20 ans de relations avec des collectionneurs qui me faisaient confiance pour, genre, protéger leurs investissements. [doucement] Et maintenant je dois appeler la succession Rothwell et expliquer que le tableau de leur grand-mère est juste... parti.

Le coup financier à lui seul pourrait—[voix qui s'éteint] je ne veux même pas calculer. On parle de quoi, 800 000 de perte après l'assurance? [soupir] Maybe more.

[épuisé] Je n'arrête pas de repasser le film, tu sais? Si j'avais commandé à emporter, si j'avais envoyé mon assistante à ma place, si j'avais—mais c'est inutile. [pause] They're gone. Et je dois trouver comment survivre à ça, putain.
587. [chaleureux] So when you said you've been skipping meals to make sure your daughter eats, I just— [pause] Let me pull up your information again. [focused] Because based on what you're telling me, um, you definitely qualify for way more than you think. [excité] Oh my God, wait, you've never applied for WIC? [accélérant] And the childcare assistance program—you could get up to eighty percent covered! That's like, what, six hundred dollars back in your pocket every month?

[avec empathie] I see this look on your face, and I get it. [doucement] Nobody ever explained this stuff to you, right? [passionné] But listen, these aren't handouts—you've been paying into these systems. [déterminé] Your daughter qualifies for the free breakfast and lunch program, plus there's actually this emergency fund for, uh, medical expenses that nobody knows about. [très sincèrement] When you said you haven't been to the dentist in three years because— [voix qui se brise] sorry, it just gets me sometimes.

[se racle la gorge] Look, I'm going to stay late tonight, [avec assurance] and we're going to fill out every single application together. [plein d'espoir] By next month, you're going to have health coverage, food assistance, childcare help— [ému] you're going to be able to breathe again. [souriant] Your whole life is about to change, I promise you that.
588. [soulagé] God, I can't believe they actually—like, Mark literally came up to me today and said, "You were right." [rire] Those exact words! After, what, two years of them basically treating me like I was, um, delusional? [amer] "Too ambitious," they said. "Not realistic." [pause] And now suddenly, [accélérant] now that the numbers are in and the board's actually impressed, everyone's all, you know, "We always knew you had it in you." [sarcastique] Right. Sure you did. [courte pause] The thing is, I mean, I'm not even angry anymore. [lentement] Okay, maybe a little angry. But mostly it's just... [soupir] I don't know, kind of surreal? Like, Sarah—Sarah who literally laughed when I presented my initial proposal—[moqueur] she asked me to mentor her today. [souffle doucement] Can you believe that? Honestly, part of me wanted to say something petty, but [chaleureux] I didn't. Because here's the thing, proving them wrong wasn't even—it wasn't the point anymore. [avec assurance] I just kept doing the work, you know? Head down, focused, and now... [souriant] now they see what I've always seen. [joyeux] And that feels pretty damn good, actually.
589. Deux cents personnes. C'est, euh, c'est ça qui me revient sans arrêt. [très lentement] Pas les chiffres sur les tableaux, pas les—les marges bénéficiaires ou quoi. [pause] C'est les visages, tu vois ? [chaleureux] Genre quand j'ai traversé l'atelier la semaine dernière et que j'ai vu Maria, elle est là depuis, quoi, trente-deux ans ? [ému] Et elle m'a juste pris les mains et—[voix qui se brise] désolée, je deviens toute—[se racle la gorge] bref, ses enfants sont à l'université, hein ? Première génération. [passionnément] Tout ça aurait disparu ! Tout !

[anxieux] Mon Dieu, enfin, quand j'ai regardé leurs comptes pour la première fois, c'était genre—franchement, c'était une catastrophe. [frustré] Trois générations à, en quelque sorte, faire les choses de la même façon pendant que tout autour d'eux... [voix qui s'éteint] Mais le truc c'est que, [animé] ils avaient tous ces actifs dont ils se rendaient même pas compte ! Les brevets à eux seuls étaient—[excité] j'ai carrément crié quand je les ai trouvés ! [rire]

[très sincèrement] Mais tu sais quoi ? Le vieux monsieur, M. Chen, il m'a, euh, il m'a remerciée hier. [lentement] Mais je n'arrête pas de penser... [longue pause] ces familles ont pas perdu leurs maisons parce que j'ai vu quelque chose que tout le monde avait raté. [soulagé] C'est pas de la stratégie, c'est—je sais pas, c'est juste... [joyeux] c'est tout, en fait, non ?
590. [voix tremblante] Mon Dieu, je n'arrive pas à m'arrêter—mes mains tremblent encore. Cette petite fille, elle était, euh, coincée sous cette voiture et j'ai juste... [halètement] J'ai même pas réfléchi, tu sais? Le changement s'est fait tout seul. [soulagé] Et pour une fois, pour UNE FOIS ça a vraiment servi à quelque chose.

[amer] 6 mois que personne ne veut même me regarder. 6 mois depuis, euh, cette soirée où j'ai—où tout le monde a vu ce que je suis vraiment. [reniflement] J'ai perdu mon travail, perdu Sarah, basically lost everything because of this... cette chose en moi.

Mais aujourd'hui, [animé] quand je l'ai entendue crier, c'était comme—je veux dire, personne d'autre ne pouvait soulever cette voiture, non? [passionné] La bête a pris le dessus et soudain je lance une voiture de 2 tonnes comme si c'était rien! [rire] Les mêmes griffes qui ont fait fuir tout le monde, elles ont, euh, they cut through her seatbelt like it was nothing.

[très lentement] Sa mère m'a regardée—la vraie moi, toute transformée—et elle n'a pas crié. Elle a juste... [pleurant en parlant] elle a dit merci. Encore et encore. Merci, merci, merci.

[chuchotant] Peut-être que je ne suis pas un monstre. [pause] Je veux dire, monsters don't save people, do they? [plein d'espoir] Peut-être que cette malédiction est en fait—je sais pas, maybe it's meant to be here. Pour des moments comme ça. [très sincèrement] Pour elle.
591. [soulagé] Oh mon Dieu, je viens de recevoir le mail—sa demande a été acceptée ! [pause] Tout, absolument tout ce qu'on a, euh, documenté. [extrêmement heureux] Marcus va enfin toucher ses indemnités ! Je veux dire, franchement, après tout ce qu'il a traversé, c'est comme—[ému] désolée, je suis un peu... [reniflement] Le truc, c'est que, tu sais, quand je l'ai rencontré pour la première fois, il pouvait à peine, euh, parler de l'Afghanistan. [avec empathie] Trois missions, et puis il rentre au pays pour mener un autre genre de bataille, tu vois ? Avec l'administration des anciens combattants. [frustré] C'est juste—ça ne devrait pas être aussi dur pour eux, tu sais ? [pause] Mais bref, on a réussi. [chaleureux] Tous ces dossiers médicaux qu'on a retrouvés, les, euh, témoignages de ses camarades d'unité, ce rapport du neurologue sur son traumatisme crânien—[joyeux] tout a compté ! [rire] Mon Dieu, j'ai littéralement commencé à pleurer en lisant la lettre d'acceptation. Genre, assise à mon bureau, juste... [voix qui s'éteint] Je veux dire, c'est pour ça que je fais ce boulot, franchement. [passionnément] Ces vétérans, ils ont tellement donné, et quand le système fonctionne enfin, quand on peut vraiment, euh, les aider à obtenir ce qu'ils méritent—[très sincèrement] il n'y a rien de mieux. Rien. [joyeux] J'ai hâte de l'appeler.
592. [halètement] Oh mon Dieu, je—attendez, qu'est-ce que vous faites tous—[shocked voice] c'est un gâteau? [pause] Les amis, je peux pas—[pleurant en parlant] oh non, je vais pleurer, I'm actually gonna cry at work right now. [reniflement] C'est, euh, c'est littéralement la chose la plus douce que quelqu'un ait jamais— [voix qui se brise] Madame Henderson, c'est vous qui avez organisé ça? Et Monsieur Tony avec votre, euh, votre hanche qui fait mal, vous êtes venu le jour de votre congé? [rire] Je suis complètement défaite là, regardez-moi!

[chaleureux] Vous savez, j'allais juste, genre, faire mon shift et peut-être prendre quelque chose à emporter plus tard, rien de spécial. [pause] Mais ça—[très sincèrement] you have no idea what this means to me. Déménager ici, recommencer à zéro, le truc c'est que je ne connaissais vraiment personne et— [joyeux] oh mon Dieu, écoutez-moi devenir toute sentimentale! [rire fort]

Jake, tu es vraiment en train de filmer ça? [embarrassé] J'ai l'air terrible! Mon mascara est probablement, tu sais, complètement foutu. [joyeux] Mais honnêtement? C'est—this might be my best birthday ever. [getting emotional] Vous n'êtes pas juste des clients, vous êtes comme—[pause] vous êtes mes gens. My morning people. [ravi] Venez ici, tous, câlin de groupe derrière le comptoir! I don't even care if corporate sees this!
593. [hésitant] J'ai eu la promotion aujourd'hui. Comptable senior. Le poste exact que Sandra avait depuis, euh, douze ans. [pause] Ils m'ont convoquée dans la salle de conférence ce matin et j'ai cru—franchement j'ai cru qu'ils allaient me virer aussi. Mais à la place, ils me donnent son bureau. [plein de regrets] Sa tasse est encore sur le bureau, tu sais ? Celle avec le mème débile du chat qui dit "J'ai survécu à une autre réunion qui aurait pu être un email."

[soupir] Elle m'a tout appris. Genre, littéralement tout sur l'audit judiciaire, sur comment lire entre les lignes des états financiers. [triste] Et maintenant je suis assise dans son fauteuil à gagner 20 000 de plus qu'elle n'a jamais gagné parce qu'ils ont "restructuré le package salarial." [amer] C'est exactement ce qu'ils ont dit. Restructuré.

Je veux dire, j'ai travaillé dur pour ça, [doucement] je sais que je le mérite. Mais c'est tellement... [voix qui s'éteint] Elle m'a envoyé un texto de félicitations ce matin. Tu te rends compte ? [voix tremblante] Ça fait trois semaines qu'elle est au chômage et elle me félicite. Elle a dit qu'elle était fière, que j'allais faire des choses extraordinaires. [pause]

[anxieux] Tout le monde me regarde comme si j'étais une sorte de traître. Mais qu'est-ce que j'étais censée faire, hein ? Refuser ? [frustré] Le crédit immobilier ne va pas se payer tout seul. [très doucement] J'aurais juste aimé que ça ne se passe pas comme ça.
594. [amer] Trente-deux ans. Trente-deux ans que je perce des boules de bowling dans cette boutique, et maintenant ils vont juste—[pause] Enfin, regarde-moi cette horreur en face. [sarcastique] "Bowl-Mart : Votre Supermarché du Bowling." Ouais, super original.

[frustré] Tu sais combien ils prennent pour un perçage ? 29,99 €. Vingt-neuf ! Je peux même pas acheter les forets à ce prix-là. [rire] Et les gens y vont vraiment, genre, [moqueur] "Oh wow, quelle affaire !" 

[triste] Mme Henderson est passée hier—elle est ma cliente depuis 97—et elle pouvait même pas me regarder dans les yeux quand elle m'a dit qu'elle avait acheté sa nouvelle boule là-bas. [soupir] Elle a dit qu'ils offraient le perçage gratuit avec l'achat. Gratuit. Comment je suis censée rivaliser avec du gratuit ?

[doucement] Mon père a lancé ce commerce. Il m'a tout appris sur la lecture de la main d'un joueur, euh, trouver le pitch et l'écartement parfaits. [chaleureux] Chaque boule était comme une petite œuvre d'art, tu vois ? Sur mesure, parfaitement équilibrée. [amer] Mais apparemment plus personne s'en fout du savoir-faire quand tu peux le faire faire par un ado avec une—[voix qui s'éteint]

[épuisé] J'sais pas, peut-être qu'il est temps de juste... [longue pause] Le bail se termine dans trois mois de toute façon. [résigné] Trente-deux ans, et tout ça se termine à cause d'une putain de chaîne de magasins.
595. I can't—I literally can't process this right now. They said yes. They actually, um, they said yes to the film. [souffle doucement] Not just yes, but like, they want to premiere it at the festival. The main stage. I mean, honestly, six months ago I had this thing sitting on my hard drive just... collecting dust, you know? [very melancholic] I was so close to deleting the whole project. Like, my finger was literally on the delete button because I thought it was garbage, absolute garbage. And now—[rire] God, I'm such an idiot—now they're calling it "visionary" and, uh, what was the word... "transcendent." [excité] Me! My weird little experimental thing that everyone said was too strange, too niche, too whatever. Actually, wait, I need to call my mom. [bégayant] She-she never stopped believing in this even when I did. Even when I was like, sobbing at three AM saying I wasted two years of my life. [se racle la gorge] The thing is, er, I almost didn't even submit it. Like, the deadline was in twenty minutes and I was just sitting there thinking, why bother, right? [extrêmement heureux] But something made me hit send. And here we are. They're flying me out. Business class. They're putting me up in a hotel. [chuchotant] This is insane. This is completely, utterly insane.
596. [confus] Fifteen years. Fifteen YEARS I've been with this company, and they're sitting me down telling me I—what? Embezzled? [rire] This has to be some kind of mistake, right? Like, there's no way anyone actually believes... [pause] Oh my God, you're serious. You're actually serious.

[en colère] I've never taken a single penny that wasn't mine! Not even—I mean, I don't even expense my coffee runs half the time! And now suddenly there's, what, [sarcastique] mysteriously missing funds that somehow trace back to me? This is insane. [frustré] Do you know how many weekends I've given up for this place? How many times I've stayed late to fix other people's mistakes?

[voix tremblante] My kids know the security guard's name because I've brought them here so many times when I had to work late. [cry] I decorated my office with their drawings, for God's sake. [longue pause] 

[amer] Someone's setting me up. That's the only explanation, because the numbers—they don't lie, right? But neither do I. [très doucement] I thought you all knew me better than this. Fifteen years, and it means nothing? [soupir] I need to call my lawyer. [furious] And when I prove this is wrong, we're going to have a very different conversation.
597. [épuisé] Okay so, um, we've got seventeen hours—no wait, [rapidement] sixteen hours now—before the hospital runs out of ventilator filters. I mean, honestly, I haven't slept in... [voix qui s'éteint] God, when did I last sleep? [courte pause] The shipment's stuck in customs and they're telling me, like, standard processing takes forty-eight hours. [frustré] Forty-eight! We don't have forty-eight hours, we have—[shouting] we have dying patients!

[respiration profonde] Right, okay, so here's the thing—I found a loophole. [animé] Emergency medical provisions, article seven point three. Basically, if I can get the health minister's signature, we bypass the whole—[soulagé] oh thank God, the email just came through. [very quickly] They signed it, they actually signed it!

[anxieux] But now, uh, the truck drivers are saying the route's flooded. Of course it is. [amer] Of course the main highway is underwater during a medical crisis. Wait wait wait, [excité] what about the military base? They have helicopters, right? And technically, this qualifies as, you know, humanitarian aid.

[passionnément] Look, I don't care if I have to, er, personally drive these supplies myself. [voix tremblante] These are kids in that ICU. Little kids who need—[pause] who need us to figure this out. [avec assurance] And we will. We always do.
598. [amer] Regarde-moi ça. Appart' penthouse, vue sur toute cette putain de ville. 20 millions planqués sur des comptes offshore et, euh, personne avec qui partager tout ça. [rire] Maman répond même plus à mes appels. Papa a changé de numéro—j'peux pas lui en vouloir.

[sarcastique] « On t'a élevée mieux que ça », c'est ce qu'elle m'a dit la dernière fois, maman. Ouais ben, [fort] votre belle éducation, elle m'a fait cumuler trois boulots juste pour payer le loyer ! [pause] J'ai fait ce que j'avais à faire. J'ai bâti un empire à partir de rien, même si ça voulait dire... [voix qui s'éteint]

[plein de regrets] Sarah veut plus que je voie les enfants. Mes propres nièces savent même pas que j'existe. Elle leur a dit que j'étais morte—[souffle doucement]—tu te rends compte ? Elle a vraiment dit à ses gamines que leur tante était morte plutôt que d'expliquer ce que je fais.

[en colère] Ils voulaient que je sois respectable ! Ils voulaient que je joue selon des règles qui étaient truquées contre nous depuis le début ! [longue pause]

[triste] J'ai tout maintenant, tu vois ? Des voitures, des maisons, en gros tout ce que l'argent peut acheter. [pleurant en parlant] Mais j'échangerais tout ça pour un seul dimanche en famille avec eux. Juste une dernière fois entendre les blagues pourries de papa, [reniflement] aider maman dans la cuisine...

[résigné] Mais c'est ça le prix. C'est ce que ça m'a coûté. [doucement] Et j'imagine que je le savais depuis le début.
599. [amer] Alors ils ont enfin remarqué, hein ? Vingt-trois ans à, euh, me crever à la tâche dans cet entrepôt et MAINTENANT ils me donnent employée du mois. [rire] Je veux dire, le timing est juste—c'est franchement hilarant quand on y pense. [pause] Mon superviseur débarque tout, genre, félicitations pour vos indicateurs de performance, [moqueur] "la meilleure emballeuse qu'on ait jamais eue," et là, littéralement dans la même phrase, il mentionne la, euh, la réunion sur l'automatisation la semaine prochaine. [frustré] Tu te fous de moi ? J'atteins ces chiffres depuis, j'sais pas, une éternité en gros, et ils choisissent MAINTENANT pour— [voix qui s'éteint]

[soupir] Le truc c'est que j'étais vraiment fière pendant, enfin, trente secondes ? [triste] Avant de réaliser ce que ça veut vraiment dire. Ils documentent ma vitesse de travail pour pouvoir, tu sais, programmer les robots pour faire pareil. [en colère] Je suis littéralement en train de former mon propre remplaçant ! [voix tremblante] Et tout le monde fait comme si on voyait pas tous ce qui arrive. Mes collègues sont tous, euh, ils font comme si de rien n'était mais on sait— [très doucement] on sait tous ce qui se passe après qu'ils "étudient nos techniques."

[épuisé] J'imagine que je devrais, euh, commencer à chercher autre chose, non ? [hésitant] Mais qu'est-ce que je suis censée faire d'autre ? C'est tout ce que j'ai— [longue pause]

[chuchotant] Vingt-trois ans.
600. [halète fort] Ils ne sont plus sur la liste. Les—les lamantins sont officiellement retirés de la liste des espèces menacées. [pause] J'ai juste, euh, j'ai reçu le mail il y a 20 minutes et je l'ai relu genre, [voix tremblante] je l'ai relu 15 fois déjà. 32 ans. Ça fait 32 ans que je—Mon Dieu, [rire] quand j'ai commencé, il en restait à peine 500 dans ces eaux.

[pleurant en parlant] Je me souviens de ce premier recensement, tu vois, les compter un par un, en pensant qu'on arrivait trop tard. Genre, franchement, je pensais qu'on documentait leur extinction. [reniflement] Mais après les zones protégées ont vraiment marché, et les collisions avec les bateaux ont chuté de, quoi, 70 pour cent ? Et les herbiers marins—[excité] oh mon Dieu, les herbiers marins sont revenus !

[lentement] Toutes ces nuits à dormir sur le bateau de recherche, euh, à rater des anniversaires, à rater—[voix qui s'éteint] ben, à rater beaucoup de choses. [rire fort] Mon ex disait toujours que j'aimais ces « vaches de mer » plus que tout le reste. [pause] Elle avait peut-être raison, enfin—[chaleureux] mais regarde-les maintenant. 2000 individus. Des petits en bonne santé chaque saison.

[très sincèrement] Ils vont s'en sortir. Après tout ça, ils vont vraiment s'en sortir. [soulagé] Je crois que j'ai besoin de, euh, m'asseoir une minute. Ou peut-être [petit rire] aller les voir. Ouais. Il faut que j'aille voir mes lamantins.
601. [défensif] Before you scream or call anyone, [doucement], let me explain why I'm here because this isn't, [hésitant], what it looks like at all.
602. Look, um, I know this seems bad but, [frustré], I was actually just trying to, well, get to those rare manuscripts in the back vault, you know?
603. [apologetic] Wait, you're living here aren't you—I can see, [surpris], the makeshift bed behind that desk and the, [chuchotant], hot plate tucked behind those encyclopedias. [pause]
604. [avec empathie] No one stays this late with a sleeping bag and, [chaleureux], three weeks of canned goods unless they've lost their place, [softly], just like I lost mine six months ago before turning to this. [soupir]
605. [plein de regrets] The fence promised me enough for those manuscripts to, [desperately], get a fresh start somewhere new.
606. [choqué] You forged historical documents and, [incrédule], displayed them publicly while the real ones are, [anxiously], locked away somewhere else entirely?
607. [vaincu] This whole night has been one, [épuisé], massive mistake and now you're probably going to, [inquiet], call the police on me anyway.
608. [méfiant] Why would you let me walk away when I just, [nerveusement], tried to rob the place you're secretly living in? [longue pause]
609. You're suggesting what exactly—that I should, [sceptique], trust a librarian who forges documents and, [cautiously], lives illegally in a public building?
610. [contemplatif] The night janitor position just opened up here and, [lentement], they don't do background checks for custodial staff, [meaningfully], plus it comes with a legitimate key to the building.
611. [defiant] Well, um, these creatures deserve freedom, not, [passionnément], living their entire lives in concrete tanks while you, er, [frustré], play god with their genetics, you know?
612. [hésitant] I mean, uh, keeping them captive can't be the answer when, [confus], nature has its own ways of healing and, like, [doucement], maybe we should trust that process, you know?
613. [chuchotant] Um, I didn't, er, know that.
614. Well, um, every animal I've rescued wanted freedom more than, [triste], safety, and I thought these fish would, uh, [plein de regrets], feel the same way, but maybe I was, like, [voix qui s'éteint], projecting my own beliefs onto them.
615. [apologetic] Well, um, I just, er, couldn't stand it.
616. [anxieux] The way they circle endlessly in those tanks like, [très doucement], prisoners counting days they'll never get back, and seeing their eyes, [pleurant en parlant], always searching for something that isn't there anymore. [reniflement]
617. But surely, I mean, their instincts must tell them, [plein d'espoir], there's something more beyond these walls, er, [accélérant], some genetic memory of rivers and currents, you know? [souffle doucement]
618. [excité] Then you understand why keeping them here feels, [melancholic], fundamentally wrong to someone like me.
619. [softly] Well, um, maybe we could work together somehow, like, [hopefully], combining your scientific knowledge with, uh, [friendly], my field experience to create something better than either of us imagined, you know?
620. [déterminé] Then let me help you do it right by, [sincère], teaching me what these fish really need instead of, [suppliant], what I assume they want based on my rescue work. [soft laugh]
621. [confus] I thought you said she wasn't playing anymore when you called, [hésitant], but I can hear Rachmaninoff coming through the ceiling right now, [doucement], beautifully actually. [longue pause]
622. [avec empathie] That's the fourth time in two years she's returned home, [frustré], each time with the piano more damaged than before from her, [anxieux], explosive practice sessions when things don't go, [lentement], perfectly.
623. [sévère] Um, actually, I mean—[voix qui s'éteint]
624. [très sincèrement] Mrs. Chen, I've been tuning this Steinway for fifteen years and watching it, [upset], absorb her rage every time she fails has been, [très doucement], heartbreaking for both the instrument and, [chuchotant], probably for her too.
625. [monotone] Well, um, the hammers are completely worn down from her, I mean, aggressive playing, [apologetic], the soundboard has a new crack from last month's incident, and, like, [épuisé], I can't keep pretending these repairs are normal maintenance anymore.
626. [fermement] I've watched dozens of young pianists burn out because nobody told them, [plein de regrets], the difference between passion and self-destruction, and your daughter is, [tremblant], racing toward a cliff you keep pretending isn't there.
627. She needs honesty. [toux]
628. [résigné] I'll tune it. [deep sigh]
629. [triste] Um, pianos don't endure, Mrs. Chen, they, well, break. [gémissement]
630. [very melancholic] One day you'll sit in this room listening to silence where music, [pleurant en parlant], used to live and wonder if enabling her pain was really, [bitterly], love after all, [très lentement], but it will be too late.
631. [chaleureux] Hey there sweetheart, it's okay, I can see you're, [avec empathie], scared but we're going to find your mommy together right now.
632. [doucement] I understand completely, and, um, you know what, [joueur], I'm really good at finding people because, well, [avec assurance], that's actually part of my job, like finding lost things and helping people. [petit rire]
633. [joyeux] Exactly right!
634. Mommies never forget their babies, especially, [passionnément], wonderful brave ones like you who are being so, [très sincèrement], strong right now even though this is scary.
635. [animé] Even better!
636. [ravi] That's, um, such a sweet thing to say, and, well, I bet your mommy taught you, [proudly], lots of smart things about staying safe.
637. Emma Rose Martinez is such a, [enthusiastically], beautiful name and you did exactly the right thing talking to me.
638. [softly] Of course sweetie.
639. That sounds like the perfect place to, [encouragingly], start our search and we'll check every water fountain in this building.
640. [très sincèrement] I promise, and, you know, um, I actually just spent all morning, [déterminé], fighting for kids just like you, so, well, [émotionnellement], there's nowhere else I'd rather be than helping you find your mommy.
641. [frustré] Your Majesty, that speech wasn't just controversial, it was, [exasperated], political suicide wrapped in royal purple.
642. The nobility is already, [urgent], drafting letters calling for your abdication, and I mean, the military commanders are, [inquiet], conspicuously silent which is never, [grave], a good sign, you know.
643. [suppliant] I'd have you survive long enough to, [prudent], actually implement these reforms instead of becoming a, [amer], martyr that changes nothing except who sits on, well, your throne tomorrow, I mean.
644. [sec] Well, she also died peacefully in her bed instead of, um, facing a coup d'état at twenty-eight.
645. Integrity doesn't stop bullets, [froid], Your Majesty, and right now there are three generals who've, [tendu], canceled their meetings with you this week which means they're, [menaçant], meeting with each other instead, I mean.
646. [las] The people's support won't mean much when tanks roll through the palace gates.
647. [offended] I'm trying to save your life because despite your recklessness you're the first monarch in a century who actually gives a damn.
648. [grim] Exactly.
649. [réticent] Well, if we're doing this, um, we need to move fast—secure the treasury, [urgent], get the city guard on our side before the generals make their move.
650. [résigné] I've served three monarchs and watched two of them fall because they, [triste], lacked the courage to change anything that mattered, so maybe, [plein d'espoir], it's time I backed someone foolish enough to, um, actually try, you know.
651. [chaleureux] Well, um, some of us never left, I mean, we just kept, [lentement], kneading the same dough and watching the sunrise through these windows while you were, [amer], conquering Silicon Valley, you know.
652. Um, yeah, well, it's... [pause]
653. The irony is that this bakery we were going to, [frustré], expand together is now worth more to me than any of your, [sarcastique], stock options ever could be. [soupir]
654. [caring] Well, um, I won't lie and say I didn't feel, [en colère], abandoned when you took that job offer instead, you know.
655. [doucement] You always did chase the, [curieux], bigger picture while I was happy perfecting the, [contentedly], perfect sourdough starter, and maybe that's why we worked so well together. [petit rire]
656. [sincère] The offer still stands to be my business partner if you're, [plein d'espoir], serious about coming back, though the terms might be, [joueur], a little different now. [rire]
657. [fermement] Those papers are in the same drawer where I keep the photo from our grand opening plans, next to the, [melancholic], business cards we never got to print.
658. [songeur] Um, you know, I mean, the thing is, er, I've learned to run this place, [proudly], my way, and bringing you back means, [cautiously], giving up some of that control I've gotten used to, well.
659. Well, um, maybe we both needed to, [wisely], grow separately before we could truly work together, and, er, maybe this is actually, [optimistic], perfect timing after all.
660. [souriant] Then let's start with you helping me with tomorrow's morning batch, see if those, [teasing], soft CEO hands remember how to shape dough properly. [rire fort]
661. [épuisé] You know, I tell people every day—I mean, literally every single day—that grief is like, um, digging a hole. [amer] You can't rush it, right? Can't force your way through solid earth. [pause] I've buried, what, maybe three thousand people? And honestly, I've got this whole speech down: [chaleureux] "Your loved one is at peace now, the earth will hold them gently," all that. [sarcastique] Real poetic stuff.

[soupir] But here's the thing—when my Sarah died, I just... [voix qui s'éteint] I couldn't even pick up a shovel for weeks. [doucement] Still can't, actually. Everyone thinks, oh, he must be so wise about death, you know? [rire] The gravedigger who understands loss! [frustré] Except I don't—I really, really don't. 

[voix tremblante] I give families these perfect words about, er, healing and time and acceptance. [en colère] And then I go home to her empty chair and I can't—[pause]—I literally cannot process that she's in the ground I know so well. [très triste] The earth doesn't feel gentle. It feels like, um, like theft. [chuchotant] Sometimes I think I've buried my ability to grieve along with everyone else's dead. [amer] Funny how that works, isn't it?
662. [frozen] Oh my God, um, I mean, is that—I can't believe it's, [voix tremblante], actually her after all these years, like, [chuchotant], I never thought I'd see her again, you know?
663. [tremblant] I, uh, I used to know her, like, a really long time ago before, [voix qui s'éteint], before everything changed...
664. [pleurant en parlant] She's my sister.
665. [plein de regrets] I ran away from the foster system when I turned eighteen and, [amer], left her behind because I couldn't take it anymore.
666. [défensif] I tried to go back for her but they'd already, [voix qui se brise], moved her to another home and wouldn't tell me where because I wasn't, [vaincu], her legal guardian anymore. [sanglote]
667. She used to let me braid her hair every night before, [nostalgique], bed when we were kids.
668. [tearfully] Can I please just try to, [désespéré], talk to her and explain everything?
669. [nerveusement] I know, um, I have no right to ask for forgiveness after, well, [honteux], abandoning her like that, you know? [soupir]
670. [sincèrement] I've been saving money for three years to, [déterminé], hire a private investigator to find her and make things right somehow.
671. [reconnaissant] Thank you for taking care of her when I, [plein de remords], couldn't, for being the guardian she needed when her own, [ému], family failed her so completely.
672. [chaleureux] Eh bien, euh, quelle chance que vous ayez trébuché dans, [curieux], ma tente de spectacle juste au moment où j'étais, disons, [joueur], en train de préparer mon numéro de disparition—même si je soupçonne que le vôtre est plus, vous savez, [doucement], urgent que théâtral.
673. [autoritaire] Mettez-vous derrière ce panneau de miroir et ne, [sévère], bougez pas avant que je vous fasse signe.
674. [avec assurance] Faites-moi confiance.
675. [amusé] Ma chère fugitive, ça fait 30 ans que je fais, disons, [moqueur], disparaître des choses, et contrairement à vos poursuivants, ben, [joyeux], je peux les faire réapparaître dans des endroits bien plus intéressants.
676. [mystérieusement] Tout bon magicien sait que le vrai truc n'est pas de faire, [lent], disparaître quelque chose—c'est de contrôler où le public, [avec empathie], regarde pendant qu'on le fait. [petit rire]
677. [déterminé] Non, vous allez faire partie du spectacle—mon assistante qui se fait, [excité], scier en deux pendant qu'ils regardent, convaincus que vous n'êtes qu'une, [théâtral], autre artiste.
678. [rassurant] La beauté de l'illusion c'est que, euh, ce qui paraît dangereux est souvent, [doux], l'option la plus sûre, et puis, disons, [souriant], vous préférez affronter leurs vraies balles ? [rire]
679. [ravi] Oh j'ai déjà joué devant des fantômes—ils sont, euh, [en plaisantant], très radins pour les pourboires mais ils ne chahutent jamais, et de toute façon, [dramatique], la vraie question c'est si vous pouvez, ben, [chuchotant fort], avoir l'air terrifiée de façon convaincante.
680. [formel] Mesdames et messieurs, bienvenue à cette représentation spéciale de ce soir, [passionné], où la réalité elle-même devient, [mystérieusement], douteuse et où même la mort pourrait n'être qu'une autre, [voix qui s'éteint], illusion...
681. Maintenant regardez attentivement mon adorable assistante, [flamboyant], entrer dans la boîte aux mystères où l'impossible, [hypnotique], devient possible et où les chasseurs deviennent, [satisfait], les chassés.
682. [calme] Ben, euh, je suis pas là pour faire la morale parce que, [avec empathie], j'étais exactement à ta place quand j'avais 17 ans et, euh, [lentement], tout le monde m'avait abandonnée aussi, tu vois?
683. En fait j'ai été prise avec 2 kilos dans mon casier et j'ai passé, [plein de regrets], 6 mois en centre éducatif fermé avant que quelqu'un dans la famille accepte même de, [doucement], me regarder ce qui explique pourquoi ta mère, [voix qui s'éteint], m'a appelée moi plutôt que ton père.
684. [honnête] Pas juste dealer mais je dirigeais tout un réseau dans 3 lycées jusqu'à ce que tout, [lourdement], s'effondre et que je perde tout y compris ma, [triste], meilleure amie qui a fait une overdose. [soupir]
685. [chaleureux] Ben, euh, ça m'a pris 10 ans à bosser dans le bâtiment tout en passant mon équivalent du bac et, [déterminé], ensuite des cours du soir à la fac, tu vois?
686. [proposant] Écoute, euh, je connais un programme qui est pas une pension militaire mais, [doucement], c'est spécifiquement pour les jeunes qui ont besoin d'un cadre tout en, ben, [songeur], finissant leurs études, tu vois? [se racle la gorge]
687. [encourageant] La différence entre nous c'est que t'as été prise à 17 ans au lieu de, [sérieux], 18 ce qui veut dire que t'as encore des options que j'avais pas, [passionnément], quand ils m'ont jugée comme adulte. [rire]
688. [fermement] Ben, euh, oui.
689. [avec assurance] C'est exactement ce que je ressentais jusqu'à ce qu'une personne décide d', [sincèrement], investir en moi malgré mon casier.
690. [tendre] Ben, euh, j'ai déjà parlé à ton proviseur et, [soulagé], je l'ai convaincu de te laisser finir le semestre si, ben, [intentionnel], tu acceptes des tests de dépistage hebdomadaires et un suivi psy, tu vois? [expire]
691. [affectueux] Petite, je me vois en toi ce qui est à la fois, [inquiet], terrifiant et exactement la raison pour laquelle je vais m'assurer que tu ne, [déterminé], répètes pas mes erreurs parce que la famille n'abandonne pas la, [fort], famille même quand tous les autres le font. [respiration profonde]
692. [chaleureux] You probably don't recognize me since I was only eight when you, [hésitant], left with nothing but that old guitar case. [pause]
693. [ému] Yeah, um, I'm Emma and, [pleurant en parlant], you were the only adult who ever really listened when I talked about, like, my dreams of becoming a writer, you know. [soupir]
694. [amer] Mom never understood why I kept asking about you, um, where you went or, [frustré], if you ever thought about us—well, about me—after you disappeared one night without, [très triste], even saying goodbye, you know. [gémissement]
695. [curieux] I kept that notebook you gave me, um, the one with all your lyrics and, [passionnément], those little drawings in the margins—I mean, I've read every word probably, [excité], a thousand times over the years. [rire]
696. She tried to, um, but I hid it under my mattress and, well, [avec empathie], read your words whenever I needed to remember that someone once believed I could be more than just, you know, another small-town disappointment.
697. [sincèrement] You know, um, I became a writer just like I told you I would, and, [joyeux], my first book is actually dedicated to, well, 'the wandering musician who taught me that leaving isn't always, you know, abandonment.' [toux]
698. [doucement] Sometimes the best thing you can teach a child is that, [songeur], it's okay to choose yourself when staying would destroy you.
699. [plein d'espoir] So, um, maybe we could grab coffee and, [nerveux], I could show you that first book—I mean, if you have time before you, well, disappear again. [laugh softly]
700. [en larmes] Um, I'll be there.
701. [souriant] Well, um, maybe they were—I mean, maybe that's why I kept that notebook all these years, [compréhensif], knowing someday you'd come back and we'd both be ready for, [paisible], whatever this becomes, you know. [respiration profonde]
702. [curieux] Excusez-moi madame, je cherche des lieux pour un documentaire sur, [confus], les sites historiques de justice, et j'ai remarqué que vous semblez, [hésitant], connaître cet endroit intimement—pourriez-vous partager sa signification?
703. [chuchotant] Vous étiez la—
704. [chaleureux] Je ne savais pas, euh, que quelqu'un venait encore, je veux dire, ici pour se souvenir d'eux, et bien, votre présence ici témoigne de quelque chose, [avec empathie], de profond sur le fait de porter ce fardeau, something that, er, transcends the simple narrative of justice qu'on raconte habituellement, [lentement], dans nos films.
705. [anxieux] Madame, je veux dire, considéreriez-vous, euh, partager votre histoire devant la caméra parce que, bien, the world needs to hear from someone who, [passionné], lived inside that system?
706. [apologetic] Je comprends que ça doit être incroyablement difficile d'en parler, et je réalise que ma demande peut sembler, [honteux], insensible vu le poids que vous portez, but documenting your experience could help people, [sincèrement], understand the true cost of capital punishment au-delà des statistiques.
707. [doux] On pourrait structurer les entretiens comme vous le sentez, taking breaks whenever needed, et en se concentrant sur, [respectful], n'importe quels aspects que vous êtes à l'aise de partager.
708. Tout ce dont vous avez besoin, je veux dire, euh, we want to honor your story et, bien, les mémoires de ceux qui sont, [triste], morts ici. [reniflement]
709. [eagerly] Bien sûr, absolument.
710. Ça créerait un portrait complet de comment la peine capitale, [songeur], se répand à travers des communautés entières, affecting everyone it touches in ways that, [deeply moved], never truly heal.
711. [très sincèrement] Alors assurons-nous que ce documentaire aide les autres à comprendre ce poids, honoring both those who died and those who, [respectful], still live with the consequences d'un système qui leur a demandé de tuer.
712. Oh là là, ces applis sont, bon, totalement pas fiables mais [rire fort] j'adore que tu l'aies vraiment essayée! Est-ce que des chiffres apparaissaient sur l'écran, ou ça bipait juste au hasard sur tout ce qui était métallique autour de toi?
713. Ouais, alors ces chiffres sont censés être, hmm, des lectures de conductivité mais, en fait, les vrais détecteurs utilisent une échelle de 1 à 99. Le fer apparaît généralement autour de 10-35, tandis que les pièces d'argent sont plutôt vers 88-95 sur la plupart des machines.
714. Tu te souviens quand, euh, Papa était obsédé par [ennuyé] la chasse au trésor et nous traînait à la plage tous les weekends? I mean, I picked up way more than I wanted to know about VDI numbers and discrimination patterns.
715. Il a trouvé une bague de promo de 1967 qui affichait 79 sur son détecteur! On a passé trois semaines à chercher le propriétaire dans les archives de l'annuaire, et le gars était tellement content qu'il a pleuré.
716. L'or c'est compliqué parce que ça peut aller de 40 à 60 selon le carat et la taille. Les languettes de canettes enregistrent dans la même gamme, which is why beach hunters dig up so much trash.
717. Les applis de téléphone peuvent pas vraiment détecter le métal correctement, genre, elles utilisent juste le magnétomètre fait pour, bon, les lectures de boussole, alors, franchement, les chiffres qu'elles affichent sont basically meaningless.
718. Si t'es sérieuse, j'ai encore le vieux détecteur Garrett de Papa dans mon garage. It's from 2015 but it works great and shows proper target ID numbers.
719. Absolument! On peut commencer dans ton jardin et je t'apprendrai ce que tous les chiffres veulent dire. Fair warning though, you'll probably find about fifty bottle caps before anything interesting.
720. Concentre-toi sur les lectures constantes entre 75 et 95, [souffle doucement] ce sont tes meilleures chances pour des pièces d'argent ou des bijoux. Skip anything below 40 unless you want a collection of rusty nails and aluminum foil.
721. C'est vraiment pas si difficile une fois que tu, euh, prends le coup, mais [shouting] quoi que tu fasses, creuse pas dans le jardin de Maman sans permission parce que, franchement, elle va absolument nous tuer toutes les deux!
722. Well, capital structure is, you know, just how a company finances itself through, um, debt and equity. It's basically about finding the right mix between borrowing money and selling shares to investors.
723. Actually, yes! Even a lemonade stand has, uh, capital structure decisions like whether you, I mean, borrow twenty bucks from your parents or, well, get your siblings to invest for a share of profits.
724. That's not how finance works at all! You'd still have opportunity costs, potential legal liabilities, and you're completely ignoring the reputational risk to your theoretical lemonade empire.
725. The optimal capital [bégayant] st-structure depends on, hmm, things like tax benefits from debt, but, you know, also the risk of financial distress if you, er, borrow too much.
726. They absolutely understood it! The theorem states that, well, in perfect markets with no taxes, capital structure is, actually, irrelevant to firm value, but, I mean, real markets have all sorts of imperfections.
727. No, perfect markets mean no [rapidement] transaction costs no taxes perfect information and rational investors which obviously doesn't exist but it's a useful theoretical starting point.
728. It's not made up! These models help us understand why companies choose certain debt-to-equity ratios and how those choices affect their cost of capital and overall value.
729. That would be insane! Credit card debt has, you know, interest rates around twenty percent, so, basically, you'd need returns higher than that just to, hmm, break even on the financing costs.
730. Look, the thing is, [soulagé] you're joking but, actually, some entrepreneurs really do fund startups with credit cards when, well, they can't get traditional financing.
731. It's definitely risky but, hmm, sometimes it works out - like, the founders of Under Armour and Spanx both used, er, credit cards initially, though I really wouldn't recommend it as, you know, a primary strategy.
732. J'étais, euh, en train de bosser dessus mais [très triste] franchement, les fichiers AutoCAD se sont corrompus et, tu sais, j'ai perdu environ trois heures de boulot.
733. Ben, d'habitude je sauvegarde sur Dropbox toutes les heures mais, euh, aujourd'hui j'étais distraite et, en gros, j'ai oublié d'activer la sauvegarde automatique. La tablette Wacom me faisait des misères aussi, donc je veux dire, tout est parti en vrille d'un coup.
734. Le truc c'est que la Huion marche pas bien avec, hmm, le nouveau moteur de traçage d'Adobe Illustrator, et, ben, c'est exactement ce que le client a demandé qu'on utilise pour la vectorisation.
735. Inkscape c'est bien pour les amateurs mais [condescendant] les professionnels utilisent des logiciels standards de l'industrie comme Illustrator ou CorelDRAW pour une bonne raison. Les outils de précision et les capacités de traitement par lots sont dans des ligues complètement différentes.
736. Tu as raison, je suis désolée. C'est juste que je suis frustrée parce que Vector Magic aurait pu faire la conversion initiale en quelques minutes, mais l'abonnement a expiré la semaine dernière et personne l'a renouvelé.
737. C'est contraire à leurs conditions d'utilisation, et puis de toute façon, on a besoin de la fonction de traitement par lots qui vient seulement avec la version complète. En plus les plans Henderson ont des tracés vraiment complexes qui nécessitent des ajustements manuels de toute façon.
738. En fait, cette vieille table lumineuse Artograph est, euh, cassée et [triste] ça me rappelle, ben, quand Papa m'apprenait le dessin technique avant que tout devienne numérique, tu vois ?
739. Il a été architecte pendant trente ans avant de prendre sa retraite. Il traçait des plans à la main avec ces stylos techniques Staedtler et tout, bien avant que les logiciels de CAO prennent le contrôle de l'industrie.
740. Je veux dire, il disait toujours que, euh, le bon dessin technique c'était, en gros, respecter le métier que tu utilises, hmm, des outils traditionnels ou numériques.
741. Ouais, tu as sûrement raison. Henderson est client depuis cinq ans maintenant, et ils savent qu'on fait du travail de qualité même quand des problèmes techniques nous ralentissent de temps en temps.
742. Oh wow, vous pensez au homeschooling? Qu'est-ce qui vous a [toux] fait considérer l'éducation alternative? I've been reading about the different approaches families take, quand ils quittent le système traditionnel.
743. Le unschooling, c'est fascinant! So you'd be letting them follow their interests completely, sans curriculum fixe? Comment tu gères des choses comme les maths ou l'écriture qu'ils pourraient ne pas naturellement aimer?
744. Ça fait du sens en théorie, mais, bon, et si ils, en fait, ne développent jamais un intérêt qui nécessite l'algèbre? Est-ce que tu as, euh, contacté des familles qui font du unschooling depuis des années?
745. You should definitely find a local community! Tu as pensé à comment documenter leur apprentissage pour les applications universitaires? Certains états ont des exigences assez strictes même pour les unschoolers.
746. C'est une inquiétude valide, but there are portfolios and narrative transcripts that work really well. Quel âge ont tes enfants? L'approche varie vraiment selon qu'ils sont au primaire ou approchent du lycée.
747. Des âges parfaits pour commencer! Ils sont, hmm, excités par l'idée ou, je veux dire, ils ont des réserves sur le fait de quitter leurs amis à l'école?
748. C'est tellement normal, et, honestly, l'aspect social est ce avec quoi la plupart des familles luttent au début. Tu as, euhh, regardé les co-ops de homeschool ou les groupes de unschooling qui organisent des rencontres régulières?
749. Oh, err, je viens de me rappeler que ma cousine [très excité] dirige un centre de ressources pour unschooling à environ 40 minutes d'ici! Ils font, genre, des rassemblements hebdomadaires et ils ont même des maker spaces où les enfants travaillent sur des projets ensemble.
750. Je peux définitivement te connecter! They have families who've been unschooling for over a decade. Tu travailles de la maison, ou tu devras trouver une solution pour la supervision?
751. Mmm, tu sais, on devrait prendre un café et [flirtatious] je peux te raconter tout ce que j'ai appris en regardant le parcours de ma cousine. It's, really, quite an adventure when done right.
