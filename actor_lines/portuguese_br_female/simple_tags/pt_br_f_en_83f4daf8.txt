Scenario: A commodities trader returns to their hometown gallery to purchase artwork from their ex-spouse, an original artist whose career they once financially supported before their bitter divorce five years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] The gallery owner told me these pieces were, [shaky voice], yours and I couldn't help but notice they're all from, [quietly], the year we separated.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Every canvas in this room was painted with the, [trembling], money you said I'd never earn back on my own after you, [coldly], cut me off from our joint accounts. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I can see now that, [regretful], losing my financial support actually pushed you to create your best work, I mean. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: Um, you're standing here ready to, [confused], purchase the art that came from the darkest period of my life, you know.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, well, I've been following your career from a distance and, [apologetic], watching you succeed without me has been both painful and, um, somehow healing.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] The commodities market taught you to see everything as an investment but these paintings were never about, [frustrated], proving anything to you or anyone else, [anxious], they were survival.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, I know, er, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] You always did.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Remember how we used to argue about art versus commerce while you painted and I, [sad], analyzed market trends in the same room?

Character 2 [en]: [melancholic] Those late nights when you'd calculate futures contracts while I mixed colors seem like they, [slowly], happened to completely different people than who we, [trailing off], are now...

Character 1 [en]: The irony isn't lost on me that I'm now the, [nervously], client and you're the one setting the, [bitterly], terms of this transaction.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Well, um, you taught me about leverage and market dynamics, so I mean, [animated], I've learned to value my work at what the market will, [confidently], bear.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] That piece with the gold leaf reminds me of the, [wistfully], wheat futures I was trading the morning you left.

Character 2 [en]: Um, every brushstroke in that one was, [angry], deliberate because I needed to channel the rage somewhere that wouldn't, [exhausted], destroy me like our marriage did. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] I mean, um, I want to buy them all not as, [very sincerely], investments but as apologies I never knew how to, [stuttering], s-say out loud, you know.

Character 2 [en]: The money won't change what happened but seeing you, [upset], finally understand that my art was never about, [proudly], rebellion against your world but about finding my, [clearing throat], own voice makes this almost bearable.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, maybe we both needed these five years to, [thoughtfully], become who we were supposed to be, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: Um, like, maybe so.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Well, um, I'll take whatever pieces you're willing to sell but, [tearfully], I understand if some wounds are too deep to, [genuinely], heal with just money and regret, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [forgiving] Um, the gallery closes at six but maybe we could, [hopeful], discuss the terms over coffee like we used to, well, before everything fell apart. [deep sigh]
