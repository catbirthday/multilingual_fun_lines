=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [pessimistic] Well, um, I found out from Martinez that you've been, [frustrated], vindo pra fábrica depois do expediente, e tipo, [resigned], aparentemente fazendo umas sessões de terapia com minha equipe sem, [bitter], me falar nada sobre isso. [sigh]

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Dad, these people are, [anxious], traumatizados com o que aconteceu no Tanque 7, e eles vieram até mim porque eles, [shaky voice], precisavam desesperadamente de alguém que não ia reportar pra gerência. [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [stern] You think I don't know my own workers are, [upset], sofrendo depois de ver o Rodriguez ser puxado pra dentro daquela válvula, mas existem, [angry], protocolos e questões de responsabilidade legal, e você me colocou numa, [trailing off], posição impossível aqui...

Character 2 [mix]: [empathetically] The protocols you're talking about would have them sitting in HR meetings, [sarcastically], sendo mandados superar e voltar ao trabalho.

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] Look, um, I get it, eu entendo mesmo, mas, bom, você sabe, [regretful], 30 anos em saneamento te ensinam que às vezes proteger as pessoas significa seguir regras que elas não gostam. [long pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [whispered] Um, Dad, I mean, só escuta.

Character 1 [mix]: [exhausted] Every night since the accident, [worried], eu fico andando naquelas passarelas me perguntando se eu poderia ter evitado, me perguntando se as reuniões de segurança que eu conduzi eram só, [monotone], palavras vazias que ninguém realmente ouviu.

Character 2 [mix]: [warm] Well, um, that's exactly why they need this, quer dizer, eles tão carregando a mesma culpa que você, mas, [hesitantly], eles não podem falar com a supervisora deles sobre isso, sabe?

Character 1 [mix]: [bitterly] So instead they talk to my daughter who shows up with her theater exercises, [confused], jogos de roleplay como se isso fosse consertar o que aconteceu lá embaixo. [groan]

Character 2 [mix]: [confidently] Drama therapy isn't just games, é sobre dar às pessoas, [passionately], um espaço seguro pra processar trauma através de incorporação e contação de histórias, e 3 dos seus trabalhadores já me disseram que é, [sincerely], a única coisa que tá impedindo eles de pedir demissão.

Character 1 [mix]: [skeptical] Martinez can barely look at Tank Seven without his hands shaking, e você acha que fazer ele, [doubtfully], atuar os sentimentos dele vai mudar isso. [cough]

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] Martinez played the role of a safety inspector last week, e pela primeira vez, [relieved], ele conseguiu falar sobre o que ele queria ter notado, o que ele, [crying while speaking], queria ter feito diferente. [sniffle]

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] He actually participated in that, porque o Martinez que eu conheço nem, [slowly], aceitaria as sessões obrigatórias de aconselhamento, muito menos fazer, [whispering], seja lá o que você tá fazendo eles fazerem.

Character 2 [mix]: [animated] That's because mandatory counseling feels like punishment, mas o que a gente tá fazendo parece, [hopefully], cura. [laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: [thoughtful] Well, um, maybe, quer dizer, talvez eu tenha olhado isso tudo errado, mas, er, [softly], as questões de responsabilidade legal ainda são reais.

Character 2 [mix]: [determined] If you report this, eles vão acabar com tudo e essas pessoas vão ficar com, [sadly], nada além dos pesadelos deles, e você vai perder, [pleading], alguns dos seus melhores trabalhadores pro TEPT.

Character 1 [mix]: [wearily] Twenty-three years you've been my daughter, e você ainda acha que eu escolheria, [emotional], burocracia ao invés da minha equipe, mesmo depois de tudo que passamos, [proud], vendo você se tornar essa pessoa que ajuda as pessoas a se curarem. [deep breath]

Character 2 [mix]: [hopeful] So you'll let me continue working with them, mesmo que isso signifique, [nervously], dobrar algumas regras, mesmo que isso signifique, [gratefully], confiar em mim com sua equipe. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [mix]: [resolved] The official story is that you're conducting research on industrial workplace stress, [carefully], com participantes voluntários no tempo livre deles, e se alguém perguntar, eu não tinha ideia que minha filha era, [wryly], a pesquisadora.

Character 2 [mix]: Um, Dad, I know this isn't easy for you, e, bom, [moved], eu prometo que vou ter cuidado com eles, quer dizer, [lovingly], com sua gente. [cry]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [pessimistic] Well, um, I found out from Martinez that you've been, [frustrated], coming to the plant after hours, and I mean, [resigned], apparently running some kind of therapy sessions with my crew without, [bitter], telling me anything about it. [sigh]

Character 2: [defensive] Dad, these people are, [anxious], traumatized from what happened in Tank Seven, and they came to me because they, [shaky voice], desperately needed someone who wouldn't report back to management. [pause]

Character 1: [stern] You think I don't know my own workers are, [upset], struggling after watching Rodriguez get pulled into that valve, but there are, [angry], protocols and liability issues, and you've put me in an, [trailing off], impossible position here...

Character 2: [empathetically] The protocols you're talking about would have them sitting in HR meetings being told to, [sarcastically], move on and get back to work.

Character 1: [quietly] Look, um, I get it, I really do, but, well, you know, [regretful], thirty years in wastewater teaches you that sometimes protecting people means following rules they don't like. [long pause]

Character 2: [whispered] Um, Dad, I mean, just listen.

Character 1: [exhausted] Every night since the accident, I've been walking those catwalks wondering if, [worried], I could have prevented it, wondering if the safety meetings I ran were just, [monotone], empty words nobody really heard.

Character 2: [warm] Well, um, that's exactly why they need this, I mean, they're carrying the same guilt you are, but, [hesitantly], they can't talk to their supervisor about it, you know?

Character 1: [bitterly] So instead they talk to my daughter who shows up with her theater exercises and, [confused], role-playing games like that's going to fix what happened down there. [groan]

Character 2: [confidently] Drama therapy isn't just games, it's about giving people, [passionately], a safe space to process trauma through embodiment and storytelling, and three of your workers have already told me it's, [sincerely], the only thing keeping them from quitting.

Character 1: [skeptical] Martinez can barely look at Tank Seven without his hands shaking, and you think having him, [doubtfully], act out his feelings is going to change that. [cough]

Character 2: [firmly] Martinez played the role of a safety inspector last week and for the first time, [relieved], he could talk about what he wished he'd noticed, what he, [crying while speaking], wished he'd done differently. [sniffle]

Character 1: [surprised] He actually participated in that, because the Martinez I know wouldn't even, [slowly], take the mandatory counseling sessions, let alone do, [whispering], whatever it is you're having them do.

Character 2: [animated] That's because mandatory counseling feels like punishment, but what we're doing feels like, [hopefully], healing. [laugh]

Character 1: [thoughtful] Well, um, maybe, I mean, maybe I've been looking at this all wrong, but, er, [softly], the liability issues are still real.

Character 2: [determined] If you report this, they'll shut it down and these people will be left with, [sadly], nothing but their nightmares, and you'll lose, [pleading], some of your best workers to PTSD.

Character 1: [wearily] Twenty-three years you've been my daughter, and you still think I'd choose, [emotional], bureaucracy over my crew, even after everything we've been through, [proud], watching you become this person who helps people heal. [deep breath]

Character 2: [hopeful] So you'll let me continue working with them, even if it means, [nervously], bending some rules, even if it means, [gratefully], trusting me with your team. [gasp softly]

Character 1: [resolved] The official story is that you're conducting research on industrial workplace stress with, [carefully], voluntary participants on their own time, and if anyone asks, I had no idea my daughter was, [wryly], the researcher.

Character 2: Um, Dad, I know this isn't easy for you, and, well, [moved], I promise I'll be careful with them, I mean, [lovingly], with your people. [cry]
