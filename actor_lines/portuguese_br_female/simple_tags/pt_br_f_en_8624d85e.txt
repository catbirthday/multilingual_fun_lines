=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] I really appreciate you, [hesitantly], wanting to have this conversation with me before Mom gets home, it shows you, [warm], care about our family dynamic.

Character 2 [en]: This isn't about caring, it's about the fact that you, [stern], made a life-altering decision without consulting either of us, and now I'm supposed to, [frustrated], help you break the news to your mother.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] Well, um, I mean, technically it's my education and uh, my future, so I thought, [playful], maybe I could handle this one on my own.

Character 2 [en]: [disciplined] Your mother has been, [anxious], paying your tuition for three years, working extra shifts at the hospital to make sure you wouldn't have debt, and you think this is just, [bitter], your decision alone? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [friendly] Look, I understand that from a financial perspective this seems, [apologetic], wasteful, but sometimes the traditional path isn't right for everyone and I'm trying to, [confidently], forge my own way. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, I've been in this family for five years now, and well, I've watched your mother, [passionately], sacrifice everything for you while you've, [quietly], taken it all for granted, and I mean, it breaks my heart.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] That's not fair because you don't know what it's, [shaky voice], like to be the one she pins all her hopes on, the one who has to be perfect all the time, the one who can't, [very quietly], ever disappoint her.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Look, uh, I get that the pressure is immense, and um, maybe I haven't been in your shoes, but just, [slowly], think about how she'll feel when she finds out.

Character 1 [en]: She'll forgive me because she, [mocking], always does, that's the benefit of being her precious baby who can do no wrong even when I'm clearly, [sarcastic], doing everything wrong in your eyes.

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] That's exactly the problem.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] So um, what, you think I should be punished more, I mean, you think she should love me less, or well, [jealous], maybe you just wish she looked at you the way she looks at me?

Character 2 [en]: I think you should take some, [angry], responsibility for once instead of hiding behind her unconditional love like it's a shield.

Character 1 [en]: [formal] Well, I suppose we have different perspectives on family dynamics and um, personal accountability, which is, [relieved], perfectly understandable given our different positions here.

Character 2 [en]: Our different positions—you mean, that I'm just the stepfather who doesn't, [sad], get a real say in anything that matters here?

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] I didn't mean it like that, um, I just meant that, well, you know, we come from different backgrounds and have, [nervously], different relationships with Mom. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: You're right, we do have different relationships with her, and um, mine involves actually caring about her wellbeing while yours seems to involve, well, [disappointed], exploiting her blind spots.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Maybe you're right about some things, maybe I do take advantage sometimes, but it's not because I don't, [trembling], love her, it's because I don't know how to, [exhausted], be anything other than what she made me. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] Then maybe it's time you learned because being the favorite child won't last forever and one day you'll have to, [bored], stand on your own without her protection.

Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] You think I don't know that already, that every day I wake up terrified of the moment she sees me for who I, [crying while speaking], really am instead of who she wants me to be? [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Then show her who you really are, stop hiding behind this, [confused], perfect child act, let her love the real you instead of this character you've been, [very slowly], playing for twenty years. [long pause]
