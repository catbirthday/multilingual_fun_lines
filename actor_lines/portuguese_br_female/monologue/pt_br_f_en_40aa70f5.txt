=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] So I guess since I'm leaving for Singapore tomorrow and we're never gonna see each other again, I might as well just... say it. [pause] God, this is harder than I thought. Um. Okay. [hesitantly] The truth is, I've been jealous of you. Like, really jealous. For years actually. [laugh] There, I said it. Your promotion, your perfect relationship, that stupid award you won—I hated all of it. Well, no, I didn't hate it, I just... [trailing off] I wanted it to be me, you know? [quietly] And the worst part is, you made it look so easy. Like everything just, mmm, fell into your lap while I was killing myself trying to keep up. [sigh] I know that's not fair, I know you worked hard, but... ugh, it felt like you were always one step ahead. [sad] And instead of being happy for you, I just got more and more bitter. Started making those little comments, being kind of... passive-aggressive. [regretful] I'm sorry. I really am. It's just—I don't know, maybe if I'd been honest from the beginning, we could've been actual friends instead of whatever this was. [very melancholic] Anyway, doesn't matter now, right? I'm gone tomorrow.
