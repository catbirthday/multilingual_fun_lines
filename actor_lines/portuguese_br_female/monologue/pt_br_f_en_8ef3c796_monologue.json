[long pause] I literally trusted him with everything. You know, we've worked together for what, eight years? [bitter] Eight fucking years and he's just been, I guess, helping himself to my retirement? \n\n[angry] The signatures, they're all—hmm, they're forged. These withdrawals, I never authorized any of these. [very loudly] Thirty thousand dollars! That's, er, that's my daughter's college fund sitting in his pocket right now!\n\n[crying while speaking] I recommended him to everyone. My sister, basically half my department—oh God, what if he's been stealing from them too? [frustrated] I'm such an idiot. All those lunches, you know, acting like my friend, asking about my family and meanwhile he's just—[furious] I'm calling the police. No, wait, [quickly] I need to document everything first. Screenshots, printouts, the whole—[exhausted] How did I not see this? Really, how did I miss this happening right under my nose? [sigh] I feel so stupid."
