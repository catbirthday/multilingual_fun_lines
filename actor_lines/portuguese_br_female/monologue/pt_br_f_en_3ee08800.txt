=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: I keep meaning to write you this email, but I never know how to start. [nervous] Because how do you tell someone they basically saved your life? [pause] I was seventeen in your English class and, um... I was ready to drop out. [very quietly] My dad had just left, my mom was working three jobs, and I thought—well, I thought school was pointless. [bitter] Then you assigned that essay about our biggest fear. [chuckle] Remember? [warm] And I wrote about being invisible, about feeling like I'd never matter to anyone. [sad] You kept me after class and... [sniffle] God, you said something I'll never forget. [emotional] You said "Your voice deserves to be heard, but first you have to believe it yourself." [pause] That sounds so simple now, but back then? [laugh] It was like—woah—someone actually saw me. [very sincerely] You made me apply to college when I thought community college was, er, out of reach even. [excited] And now I'm a published writer! [extremely happy] Three books! [laugh loudly] Sometimes I'm at readings and I think... she has no idea. [warm] You probably don't even remember that conversation, but it changed everything. [crying while speaking] I almost gave up on myself, and you wouldn't let me. [very sincerely] So, um... thank you. [whisper] Thank you for believing I had something worth saying.
