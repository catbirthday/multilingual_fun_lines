I need to call my mom, I need to—wait. [slowly] Wait, this is real now. This is actually happening.\n\n[anxious] What if I'm not ready? I mean, moving across the country, starting completely over... that's huge. That's, um, terrifying actually. [short pause] Everyone keeps saying how brave I am but honestly? [whispering] I don't feel brave at all. I feel like I'm about to throw up.\n\nNo, you know what? [confidently] This is exactly what I wanted. This is why I worked so hard, why I stayed up all those nights preparing. [laugh] God, remember when I almost gave up? When I was convinced I'd never—[trailing off]\n\n[warm] I did this. Me.
