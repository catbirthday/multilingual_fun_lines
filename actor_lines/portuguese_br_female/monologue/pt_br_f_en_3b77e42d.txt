Subject: Your cart attendant efficiency system getting adopted by the entire chain and earning you a promotion

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [extremely happy] They called me into corporate today and I thought I was in trouble or something but— oh my God. [pause] The regional manager was there. [excited] And she starts showing me this PowerPoint and it's MY system! [laugh loudly] The stupid little color-coded cart thing I made because I was bored! [confidently] Apparently it increased efficiency by like forty percent at our store. [very excited] And now they're rolling it out to all two hundred locations! [gasp softly] They kept calling it "innovative" and "streamlined" and I'm sitting there like, I just didn't want to walk back and forth so much. [chuckle] But here's the crazy part. [slowly] They offered me a promotion. [pause] District operations coordinator. [anxious] Which is, um... that's a real job with an office and everything. [nervous laugh] I've been pushing carts for three years and now I'll be training managers? [hesitantly] I mean, I said yes obviously, but it's kind of terrifying? [warm] My mom cried when I told her. [smiling speaking] She kept saying "I knew you were too smart for that job" and I'm like, Mom, I literally just got lazy and made a chart. [relieved] But maybe that's what innovation is, right? [passionately] Finding better ways to do things because the old way sucks. [happy] Guess I'm management now.
