Speaker [en]: [bitter] They finally admitted it. Three years—three whole years after I begged them to listen. [laugh] The foundation was cracked, just like I said. I had the engineer's report and everything, but no, [mocking] "You're being paranoid, you're overreacting." [pause] And now the whole building's condemned. 

[frustrated] Mom lost everything. Her savings, her retirement, all of it just—gone. [shaky voice] I tried so hard to convince her not to buy that condo. [very sad] Showed her the photos, the water damage, um, even brought my contractor friend to look at it. But Dad said I was being dramatic, [trailing off] that I didn't know what I was talking about...

[sigh] The lawyers called today. [monotone] Said I was right about everything. The structural damage, the cover-up, all of it. [regretful] They're actually using my old emails as evidence now. [hesitantly] I should feel... I don't know, vindicated? 

[crying while speaking] But she's living in my spare bedroom now, seventy-three years old and starting over. [sniffle] Being right doesn't, well—it doesn't give her those years back. [very quietly] It doesn't fix anything. 

[exhausted] I just wish, for once, that I'd been wrong.
