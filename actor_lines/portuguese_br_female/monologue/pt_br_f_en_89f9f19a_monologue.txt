Speaker [en]: [relieved] Oh my God, we did it. We actually—I mean, thirty-two million over four years. [pause] I just got off the phone with Marcus and he was, um, he couldn't even speak. His mom was crying in the background. [empathetically] You know, she's been working three jobs since his dad passed, and now she can finally, like—she can breathe. [short pause] 

I keep thinking about when I first saw him play, right? This kid from, uh, basically nowhere, wearing these beat-up sneakers held together with duct tape. And honestly, the way he moved on that court was just—[passionately] I knew, I absolutely knew he was special. [chuckle] The GM tried to lowball us at first, you know how it goes, but I wasn't having it. Not for Marcus. 

[very quietly] His little sister can go to that school now, the one with the music program. [pause] That's what gets me, I think. It's not just—I mean, sure, the cars and houses, whatever—but it's like, [slowly] his whole family's trajectory just changed. Forever. [sniffle] 

Thirty-two million. [extremely happy] God, I love this job sometimes.
