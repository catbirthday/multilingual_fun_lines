Speaker [en]: [relieved] God, I can't stop thinking about what happened on Wednesday with the, um, the new guy almost getting his hand caught in the filleting machine. Like, honestly, if we hadn't installed those emergency stops last month—[shaky voice] I mean, Jesus, it could've been so bad. Really bad. 

You know, everyone thought I was being, er, paranoid when I kept pushing for the new protocols. "It's just fish processing," they said. [bitter] Yeah well, those blades don't care what they're cutting through, do they? And the thing is, I kept imagining—actually no, I don't even want to think about it.

[pause] 

When I heard that alarm go off and saw him pull his hand back just in time, I literally—my whole body just, hmm, went cold. [very quietly] Two seconds later and we'd be calling an ambulance. Or worse. 

But the system worked! [excited] The guards, the sensors, that mandatory training video everyone complained about—it all worked! I mean, sure, people still think I'm kind of a safety freak, but whatever. [proudly] That kid still has all ten fingers because I wouldn't shut up about protocols.

[sigh]

I guess being the annoying safety person is, you know, worth it. Absolutely worth it.
