Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] I got the email. The one I've been waiting for, like, three months? And I can't even open it. My hands are literally shaking right now. [pause] Okay. Okay, I'm doing this. I'm clicking it. 

[gasp loudly] Oh my God. Oh my God, I got in. I actually—[extremely happy] they said yes! They picked me! Out of thousands of people, they picked ME! I need to call my mom, I need to—wait. [slowly] Wait, this is real now. This is actually happening.

[anxious] What if I'm not ready? I mean, moving across the country, starting completely over... that's huge. That's, um, terrifying actually. [short pause] Everyone keeps saying how brave I am but honestly? [whispering] I don't feel brave at all. I feel like I'm about to throw up.

No, you know what? [confidently] This is exactly what I wanted. This is why I worked so hard, why I stayed up all those nights preparing. [laugh] God, remember when I almost gave up? When I was convinced I'd never—[trailing off]

[warm] I did this. Me. Nobody else, just... me. [sniffle] And yeah, it's scary, but maybe that's the point? Maybe the best things are supposed to feel this big. [relieved] I'm really doing this. I'm actually doing this.
