[short pause] \n\nI keep thinking about when I first saw him play, right? This kid from, uh, basically nowhere, wearing these beat-up sneakers held together with duct tape.

Not for Marcus. \n\n[very quietly] His little sister can go to that school now, the one with the music program. [pause] That's what gets me, I think. It's not just—I mean, sure, the cars and houses, whatever—but it's like, [slowly] his whole family's trajectory just changed. Forever. [sniffle] \n\nThirty-two million.
