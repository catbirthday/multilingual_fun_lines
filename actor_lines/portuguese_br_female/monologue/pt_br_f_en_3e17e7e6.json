[thoughtfully] The same way I'd teach kids how to, um, set up camp for the first time. [pause] And she looked at me like I'd just solved world hunger or something. [short pause]\n\n[happy] It's weird because I never really thought those skills would, uh... translate? [confused] But now Marcus comes to me with everything, and I'm basically running the same confidence-building exercises we did before, you know, the big hikes. [animated] \"You've got this, just one step at a time,\" all that stuff. [laugh] \n\n[very sincerely] And the thing is, they actually look up to me now. [shy] Which is, hmm, kind of overwhelming honestly? [empathetically] Because I remember being them, being completely lost and just needing someone to say \"hey, it's okay to not know everything.\" [relieved] Turns out all those years of helping twelve-year-olds tie knots and navigate trails... [smiling speaking] well, apparently that's exactly what makes a good mentor. [warm] Who knew, right?"
