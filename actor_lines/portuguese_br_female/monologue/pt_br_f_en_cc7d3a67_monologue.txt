Speaker [en]: [excited] They just called me in and—oh my god, I actually got it. [pause] Senior Director of Marketing Operations. [laugh] Five years, um, five whole years of basically killing myself for this and it's... [trailing off] it's finally happening. [very quietly] Except, like, the thing is—I was sitting there in Gerald's office, you know, and he's going on about quarterly projections and expanded responsibilities, and I just [confused] I couldn't stop staring at his dead plant. [bitter] Eight years he's had that plant. Never watered it once. And suddenly I'm thinking, er, is this really what I— [sigh] I mean, Sarah from accounting literally had a breakdown in the parking garage last week. [anxious] Tom's on his third divorce. Everyone here looks, hmm, exhausted all the time. [sad] And now that's going to be me, isn't it? [laugh hard] God, the timing! I've been secretly browsing other jobs for, well, probably two months now? [frustrated] I even had an interview last week that went—it went really well actually. [whispering] But I thought I'd never get this promotion so it didn't matter, and now... [long pause] now I have exactly what I thought I wanted. [very melancholic] And all I can think about is, uh, how badly I want to leave.
