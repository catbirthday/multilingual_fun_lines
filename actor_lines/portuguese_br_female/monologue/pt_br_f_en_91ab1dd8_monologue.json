Her savings, her retirement, all of it just—gone. [shaky voice] I tried so hard to convince her not to buy that condo.

The structural damage, the cover-up, all of it. [regretful] They're actually using my old emails as evidence now. [hesitantly] I should feel... I don't know, vindicated? \n\n[crying while speaking] But she's living in my spare bedroom now, seventy-three years old and starting over. [sniffle] Being right doesn't, well—it doesn't give her those years back. [very quietly] It doesn't fix anything. \n\n[exhausted] I just wish, for once, that I'd been wrong."
