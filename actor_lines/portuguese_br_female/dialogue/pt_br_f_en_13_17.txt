Character 1 [en]: So you're the new synchronized swimmer who's supposedly going to save our team?

Character 2 [en]: Ha! Save is, um, a pretty strong word—I'd say [joking] more like, you know, gently nudge in a slightly less disastrous direction? Look, I trained with the Russians for six years but honestly, that doesn't mean I walk on water or anything.

Character 1 [en]: The Russians? Seriously?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I know how it sounds—big scary Russians with their, er, perfect technique and all that, but actually, they're just regular people who happen to be, like, obsessed with counting beats. Half my training was just sitting around arguing about whether a spin should take three counts or three and a quarter.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, um, you're telling me the world champions, like, argue about quarter beats?

Character 2 [en]: Oh constantly! You should've seen Natasha and Viktor go at it—one time they got so, well, heated about a lift transition that they didn't speak for, I mean, two weeks. The thing is, at that level everyone's technically perfect, so you end up obsessing over these tiny details that probably nobody else even notices.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds exhausting.

Character 2 [en]: It was exhausting! That's partly why I'm here, to be honest—I missed just enjoying the water without analyzing every micro-movement. Don't get me wrong, the discipline was incredible, but sometimes you need to remember why you started.

Character 1 [en]: So, uh, why did you start? I mean, like, what got you into synchronized swimming?

Character 2 [en]: My little sister actually—she was terrified of water after a bad experience at the beach, and I started doing these silly underwater dances to make her laugh. One thing led to another, and suddenly I'm doing handstands for hours while someone yells at me in Russian.

Character 1 [en]: From helping your sister to world championships—that's quite a journey.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, it's been... well, it's been something. The funny thing is, err, she still can't swim—absolutely refuses to get in anything deeper than a bathtub. But she watches all my competitions online and texts me these, actually, ridiculously detailed critiques about my facial expressions.

Character 1 [en]: Your facial expressions?

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, yes—apparently I make this weird grimace when I'm concentrating that she calls my "angry fish face." She's been documenting it for years; she has a whole folder of screenshots. It's mortifying but also hilarious.

Character 1 [en]: I need to see this angry fish face.

Character 2 [en]: No no no, absolutely not—I've been working, hmm, really hard to control it, though I probably just did it right now thinking about it. The thing is, once you know you do something like that, you become, sort of, hyper-aware and then you overcorrect and make different weird faces.

Character 1 [en]: You know, I used to [very quietly] stick my tongue out during spins.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, seriously? That's amazing—please tell me there's video evidence of this somewhere because that's exactly the kind of thing that makes this sport human instead of just pretty robots in the water.

Character 1 [en]: There might be, um, one or two clips from, like, high school competitions that my mom refuses to, you know, delete.

Character 2 [en]: Okay, here's the deal—you show me those, and I'll, well, show you my sister's entire angry fish face collection, but honestly, we're gonna need snacks because there are, er, hundreds of them.
