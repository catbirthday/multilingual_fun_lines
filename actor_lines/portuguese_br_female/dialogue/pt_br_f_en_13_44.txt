Character 1 [en]: Did you say you used to work in international logistics?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, actually, I spent, um, five years coordinating shipments between Southeast Asia and North America. It's kind of weird going from that to serving coffee, but, you know, the hours are better and I needed a break from the constant time zone juggling.

Character 1 [en]: So, what made you, like, leave that whole industry, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: Well, the burnout was real, honestly, and, uh, after managing a crisis where we lost a container ship's worth of goods in a storm, I just needed something simpler. Plus the stress of dealing with customs regulations in, er, twelve different countries was literally giving me migraines.

Character 1 [en]: Oh right, because dealing with [sarcastic] coffee orders is, hmm, so much less stressful, I guess?

Character 2 [en]: Ha! Okay so, you got me there, but, actually, at least when someone complains about their latte, it's just one drink, not, like, two million dollars of electronics stuck at a port. The stakes are refreshingly lower.

Character 1 [en]: Two million dollars? That's insane.

Character 2 [en]: That was just one shipment! We regularly moved ten to fifteen million in goods per month, coordinating between factories in Vietnam, warehouses in California, and distribution centers across the country.

Character 1 [en]: But, um, didn't you miss the, er, excitement of all that?

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes I do miss the adrenaline rush of solving complex logistics puzzles. There's something satisfying about figuring out how to reroute an entire supply chain when a typhoon hits or when port workers go on strike.

Character 1 [en]: So, honestly, do you think you'll, well, ever go back to it?

Character 2 [en]: Maybe eventually, but right now I'm enjoying having weekends and not waking up at 3 AM to call Shanghai. Plus I'm learning a lot about small business operations here that could be useful if I ever start my own import company.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, you're thinking about, uh, starting your own company, basically?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I've been sketching out a business plan for importing specialty coffee directly from small farms. My logistics background would help cut out middlemen and get farmers better prices while keeping costs reasonable here.

Character 1 [en]: That's, like, pretty ambitious though, you know, for someone who left because of stress.

Character 2 [en]: True, but it would be different when it's your own business and you're passionate about the product. Plus I'd start small, maybe just one or two farms in Colombia or Ethiopia, not trying to manage global supply chains for massive corporations.

Character 1 [en]: Have you made any connections with farms yet?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yes! I've been talking to this [child-like] amazing family farm in Rwanda that grows the most incredible bourbon variety beans. They send me samples and everything, and their emails are so enthusiastic about finding direct trade partners.

Character 1 [en]: Samples? So you're, hmm, already testing products, kind of?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I've been, er, doing cuppings on my days off, and [short pause] honestly, the quality difference between direct trade and what most places serve is mind-blowing. Want to try some? I actually brought a thermos of the Rwandan stuff today.
