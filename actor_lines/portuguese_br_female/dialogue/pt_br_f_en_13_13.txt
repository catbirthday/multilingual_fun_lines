Character 1 [en]: So wait, you actually started in a funeral home? That's... that's fascinating, honestly.

Character 2 [en]: Oh gosh, yeah, I know it's, um, super weird when you say it out loud, right? But honestly there's something really profound about it—like, you're basically giving families their last memory of someone, so every single brushstroke matters in this, I dunno, deeply spiritual way.

Character 1 [en]: I never thought about it like that. Must've been intense.

Character 2 [en]: Incredibly intense, yeah. But here's the thing—dead faces, they don't lie about structure, you know? There's no tension, no expressions pulling things around, just pure anatomy, and that, um, that really teaches you how light actually works on bone and skin.

Character 1 [en]: And then you just... jumped into fashion?

Character 2 [en]: [clearing throat] Well, fashion kind of found me, actually! This photographer walks into the funeral home for his grandmother's service and sees my work and he's like "you need to be doing this on living people" and I'm thinking, uh, okay sure, whatever you say, but three weeks later I'm literally backstage shaking.

Character 1 [en]: Oh man, that transition must've been wild.

Character 2 [en]: Wild doesn't even—yeah, it was insane. Living faces move, they sweat, they have really strong opinions about, like, coral versus peach, and suddenly I'm dealing with egos and these crazy deadlines and, mmm, models who literally won't stop talking while I'm trying to do their lips.

Character 1 [en]: But you obviously figured it out. What clicked for you?

Character 2 [en]: [high-pitched] Oh! I realized makeup is basically, um, it's sculpture with a time limit, you know? You're creating these dimensional illusions that have to survive under hot lights, through actual tears, past midnight—it's like, it's architecture that moves and breathes and sweats.

Character 1 [en]: That's such a beautiful way to describe it!

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, it's true though—faces are just, they're geography waiting to happen, right? Hills and valleys and these plains that need light and shadow, and the real artistry is, err, reading the person inside the face and somehow bringing that forward.

Character 1 [en]: Do you have a signature move or technique?

Character 2 [en]: [trailing off] Mmm, I kind of compose faces like music, if that makes sense? Like crescendo here, diminuendo there, staccato highlights, this legato blending thing I do—every face gets its own rhythm based on bone structure and honestly their personality too...

Character 1 [en]: Okay that's officially the coolest description of makeup I've ever heard.

Character 2 [en]: [mumbling] Ha, thanks, but really it doesn't matter if it's some nervous bride or whatever A-lister—we're all just skin and stories in my chair, though I gotta say, that first-time bride energy is, oof, it's electric in the best way possible.

Character 1 [en]: Have you ever had any complete disasters?

Character 2 [en]: Oh my god, once I had exactly three minutes to fix this celebrity's full face after she ugly-cried off literally everything—mascara everywhere, foundation just streaked to hell—but we made it work with, um, tissue and powder and basically magic, and she looked absolutely luminous.

Character 1 [en]: Do you ever get burnt out on it all?

Character 2 [en]: Burnt out on transformation? Honestly, never. Every face is this blank canvas with, like, infinite possibilities, and I get to help people see themselves differently—more bold, more themselves, just... amplified and real, you know?
