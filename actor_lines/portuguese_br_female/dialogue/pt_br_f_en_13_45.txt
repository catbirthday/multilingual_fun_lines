Character 1 [en]: So, um, have you heard about what Malcolm Gladwell said, you know, in Outliers about the, er, ten thousand hour rule?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I read that years ago when [bored] everyone was obsessed with it. He talks about The Beatles in Hamburg and Bill Gates at Lakeside School, claiming they all needed ten thousand hours to achieve mastery in their fields.

Character 1 [en]: Right, but, I mean, don't you think that applies to, well, your situation with the Carnegie Hall audition, actually?

Character 2 [en]: That's different because I've been playing violin since [upset] I was four at Juilliard Pre-College. If hours alone guaranteed mastery, I'd be playing with the New York Philharmonic by now, not still struggling with Paganini's Caprice No. 24.

Character 1 [en]: But you're comparing yourself to people like Itzhak Perlman and Hilary Hahn!

Character 2 [en]: Exactly my point - they had the same hours of practice but something else, some ineffable quality that separates competence from true mastery. Even my teacher at Manhattan School of Music says technical proficiency isn't enough.

Character 1 [en]: What about Anders Ericsson's research at Florida State University though?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, well, Ericsson's work on, um, deliberate practice is more nuanced than Gladwell's popularization, you know. He studied violinists at the Berlin Academy and found that, er, quality of practice matters more than, basically, raw hours logged.

Character 1 [en]: So, hmm, you're saying you haven't been, like, practicing deliberately enough, I guess?

Character 2 [en]: Maybe, or maybe I'm just not [chuckle] cut out for this level. When I watch videos of Joshua Bell at my age, or read about how Yehudi Menuhin performed with the San Francisco Symphony at seven, it's clear some people have something beyond practice.

Character 1 [en]: But, honestly, didn't Tiger Woods say at Augusta that, um, talent without work is, you know, nothing?

Character 2 [en]: Tiger's dad Earl had him on The Mike Douglas Show at age two, so, putting like a golf club in his hands. That's, um, different from starting at four, and anyway, he had access to, er, resources at Stanford that most people never get.

Character 1 [en]: You sound [bored] exactly like my brother before he made partner at Goldman Sachs.

Character 2 [en]: Your brother at Goldman [laugh] probably didn't have to compete against prodigies from the Moscow Conservatory! Investment banking mastery and artistic mastery are completely different beasts, especially when you're trying to get into somewhere like the Vienna State Opera.

Character 1 [en]: Look, I mean, even Kobe Bryant had [bitter] rough seasons, you know, before winning championships with the Lakers, actually.

Character 2 [en]: True, and Kobe's "Mamba Mentality" thing is, well, [quickly] actually similar to what my professor at Peabody Institute keeps saying - that, um, mastery requires embracing failure as, basically, part of the process.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly! And, er, didn't Martha Graham dance until, like, she was seventy-five at the Kennedy Center, you know?

Character 2 [en]: She did, and, honestly, that gives me hope because, um, maybe mastery in performance isn't about, you know, being perfect at twenty-five. Maybe it's about what Yo-Yo Ma calls "the long game" of, er, artistic development over decades.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, you'll keep preparing for Carnegie, I guess, even if it takes, well, longer than planned?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I'll keep working with my teacher from Curtis Institute and practicing those Paganini caprices. Because maybe mastery isn't a destination but what happens when you stop counting the hours and just love the process itself.
