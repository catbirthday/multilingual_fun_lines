Character 1 [en]: So, um, you're doing stand-up now? I heard you, well, [cough] sort of bombed at the open mic last week.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, uh, bombed doesn't even begin to describe it—you know, I actually died up there, was resurrected by sheer embarrassment, and then, I mean, died again. The audience was so quiet I could hear someone unwrapping a cough drop in the back row, and that person left halfway through.

Character 1 [en]: That bad?

Character 2 [en]: Picture this: I'm up there, er, telling my best material [very quietly] about my grandmother's funeral—which sounds dark but like, it's actually hilarious in context—and basically this guy in the front row just starts slowly shaking his head at me.

Character 1 [en]: He was shaking his head during your set?

Character 2 [en]: Not just shaking—it was this slow, disappointed dad shake, like when you tell your father you dropped out of med school to pursue interpretive dance. And the worst part? He stayed for my entire fifteen minutes, just radiating pure disappointment.

Character 1 [en]: Jesus, that's, hmm, rough. Why didn't you just, really, cut it short? The thing is, I would've run off stage.

Character 2 [en]: Because I'm an idiot who believes in commitment! Plus, so, there's this unwritten rule [delighted] in comedy where if you bail early, honestly, you might never get stage time again—it's kind of like the comedy mafia, except instead of cement shoes, they just give you crushing self-doubt.

Character 1 [en]: But you're going back [cry loudly] next week? After all that?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! See, actually, the thing about bombing is that, well, once you've experienced the absolute worst-case scenario, err, everything else feels manageable. I guess last week I learned that I can survive fifteen minutes of pure silence and one guy's visible disappointment.

Character 1 [en]: What if the same guy shows up?

Character 2 [en]: Then I'm making him part of the act! I've been, uhh, working on this whole bit about him—you know, "There's my biggest fan, folks, he's here every week to practice his neck exercises"—it's just that turning your hecklers into material is like comedy judo or something.

Character 1 [en]: That's, um, either brilliant or like, completely insane. Anyway, what if he doesn't find it funny?

Character 2 [en]: Then at least we'll have moved from disappointed head-shaking to angry head-shaking, which is technically an emotional progression. Any reaction beats silence—even if someone throws a tomato, hey, at least they brought produce to a comedy show.

Character 1 [en]: You're, honestly, taking this better than I would. I'd be, uh, [empathetically] hiding under my bed for a month, sort of reliving every terrible moment.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I did that for the first three days—just lying there, [regretful] replaying every failed punchline, wondering if maybe accounting would've been the safer choice. But then I realized that every comic has these stories, and mine's not even close to the worst.

Character 1 [en]: Really? There are, well, worse bombing stories? I can't, umm, [cry loudly] imagine anything worse than what you described, actually.

Character 2 [en]: So, my friend got booed off stage at a corporate event, really, and as he was leaving, er, someone yelled "HR wants to see you"—and you know, he didn't even work there! They just wanted to formally complain about his set to someone, anyone.

Character 1 [en]: No way. That's, basically, savage. Did he, ah, like, ever perform again?

Character 2 [en]: He's headlining the Comedy Store next month! That's the thing, hmm, about comedy—your worst night can actually become your best material, well, if you survive it. Every disaster is just a future punchline waiting to happen, kind of like life but with more drunk people.
