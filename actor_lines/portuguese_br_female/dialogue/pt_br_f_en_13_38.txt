Character 1 [en]: Um, are you seriously wearing that, sort of, ridiculous green hat to teach, you know, about Bloom's Taxonomy today?

Character 2 [en]: Well, it's St. Patrick's Day, and basically, [condescending] I thought we could discuss how Benjamin Bloom's mastery learning principles, er, actually align perfectly with Irish educational traditions! The Irish have always valued deep understanding over superficial knowledge, which is exactly what Bloom advocated in 1968.

Character 1 [en]: But we're supposed to be covering Khan Academy's implementation methods this afternoon!

Character 2 [en]: Khan Academy's approach is fundamentally based on Bloom's mastery learning framework—students must demonstrate proficiency before moving forward, just like Irish dancers who perfect each step before advancing to the next level! Sal Khan himself has cited Bloom's Two Sigma Problem as inspiration for the entire platform.

Character 1 [en]: Irish dancing and educational theory? That's quite a stretch!

Character 2 [en]: Not really—both require deliberate [long pause] practice and incremental skill building, concepts that Anders Ericsson studied extensively in his research on expertise! The Riverdance performers didn't just wake up able to execute those complex rhythms; they used systematic progression exactly like Kumon Math does.

Character 1 [en]: Kumon and Riverdance in the same sentence? Now I've heard everything!

Character 2 [en]: Both systems emphasize automaticity through repetition until the foundational skills become second nature! When Michael Flatley was developing his technique, he was essentially following the same principles that Siegfried Engelmann used in Direct Instruction—master the basics completely before adding complexity.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, I suppose that, like, makes sense, but actually, isn't today supposed to be fun?

Character 2 [en]: I mean, learning about mastery pedagogy IS fun when you, uhh, [laugh histerically] realize how it connects to everything, honestly! Fred Keller's Personalized System of Instruction from 1968 would have students celebrating their individual progress milestones, just like we're celebrating Irish heritage today!

Character 1 [en]: Okay, [friendly] you've convinced me—tell me more about these connections!

Character 2 [en]: So, the thing is, when John Carroll wrote "A Model of School Learning" in 1963, he kind of, revolutionized how we think about time and achievement! Instead of fixed time with variable achievement—like traditional St. Patrick's Day parades that happen regardless of preparation—mastery learning uses variable time to ensure fixed, high achievement for everyone.

Character 1 [en]: Uh, that reminds me of something, anyway, didn't Montessori, I guess, advocate for similar principles?

Character 2 [en]: Right so, Maria Montessori's methods really, predate formal mastery learning theory, but it's just that, they share core principles! Her three-year age groupings and self-paced materials align beautifully with Benjamin Bloom's vision of students progressing when ready, not when the calendar dictates.

Character 1 [en]: Umm, speaking of calendars, here's the thing, shouldn't we, ah, head to the St. Patrick's Day faculty lunch soon?

Character 2 [en]: We have ten more minutes, and err, I haven't even mentioned how [laugh histerically] Competency-Based Education programs, you know, at Western Governors University are just, scaling these exact principles! WGU students advance by demonstrating mastery, not by sitting through predetermined semesters—it's revolutionary and deeply aligned with how the Irish preserved knowledge through oral tradition for centuries.

Character 1 [en]: The Irish oral tradition and WGU? You're really committed to this theme!

Character 2 [en]: The parallel is striking—both systems prioritize deep understanding and practical application over superficial coverage! Just as Irish storytellers ensured each tale was perfectly memorized before passing it on, programs like DreamBox Learning adapt in real-time to ensure each math concept is truly mastered before progression.

Character 1 [en]: Fine, but can we at least grab some corned beef while discussing adaptive learning algorithms?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! And while we eat, I'll explain how Robert Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction map perfectly onto traditional Irish teaching methods—the way they taught Gaelic through song and story follows his exact sequence from gaining attention through ensuring retention and transfer!
