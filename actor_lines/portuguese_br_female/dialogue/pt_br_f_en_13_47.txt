Character 1 [en]: Um, can you teach me, like, aerial silks, you know, someday?

Character 2 [en]: So, I'd love to help you get started, actually, but we need to build your grip strength first, er, with some basic conditioning exercises! Most beginners need at least six weeks of preparation before attempting any real climbs or wraps.

Character 1 [en]: Uh, how long before I can, I mean, do those beautiful drops, kind of?

Character 2 [en]: Well, drops require, basically, [very meekly] at least a year of consistent training, hmm, sometimes two. You need to master foot locks, hip keys, and understanding fabric theory before attempting anything that involves releasing and catching yourself mid-air.

Character 1 [en]: Would you spot me?

Character 2 [en]: Uhh, absolutely, I'll be right there, the thing is, we start with everything low to the ground, I guess, maximum three feet up. Safety is everything in circus - one bad wrap can cause serious injury, so we progress incrementally through proven skill sequences.

Character 1 [en]: Honestly, could I, sort of, try the trapeze instead, anyway?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, flying trapeze might actually be easier to start with, it's just that, you'll need to learn the knee hang first, really! The timing for the catch is surprisingly forgiving once you understand the pendulum physics and trust the catcher's calls.

Character 1 [en]: Err, what about juggling, you know, while we wait for equipment, right so?

Character 2 [en]: Perfect starting point! We'll begin with scarves because they float slowly, giving your brain time to process the cascade pattern. After two weeks of consistent practice, most people can maintain three balls for at least thirty seconds.

Character 1 [en]: Can we perform together someday?

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, partner acrobatics would be amazing, I think, and we could start with basic counterbalances, well, maybe in three months! Your enthusiasm is infectious, and having a training partner who's this motivated makes the whole journey more rewarding and fun.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, do you think I'm, um, too old to start, okay so?

Character 2 [en]: Never! I've taught people in their seventies who went on to perform professionally in hand balancing and rope acts. The circus community celebrates every body type and age because different acts require different strengths and abilities.

Character 1 [en]: Will it hurt?

Character 2 [en]: Sure.

Character 1 [en]: But worth it?

Character 2 [en]: Every bruise and rope burn becomes [deep pitch] a badge of honor when you nail that trick you've been working on for months! The physical discomfort is temporary, but the confidence and strength you build last forever.

Character 1 [en]: When do we [sigh] start?

Character 2 [en]: Tomorrow morning at nine - bring water, wear fitted clothing that covers your armpits and backs of knees, and get ready to discover muscles you didn't know existed! I'll have the crash mats ready and we'll begin your circus journey properly.
