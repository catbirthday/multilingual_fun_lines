Character 1 [en]: Hey, I heard you've been working on that real-time analytics pipeline. How's it going?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, it's been quite a journey! Have you ever dealt with Apache Kafka's partition rebalancing issues when [trailing off] consumers keep dropping... It's like trying to juggle water balloons while someone keeps adding more.

Character 1 [en]: I know exactly [whispering] what you mean. The lag spikes are killing us.

Character 2 [en]: Right? So, um, here's what I'm curious about—are you folks, like, using Kubernetes for orchestration, or, honestly, going with something more managed? Because we found that autoscaling based on consumer lag metrics gets really tricky with stateful stream processors.

Character 1 [en]: We're on Kubernetes, but thinking about switching to Confluent Cloud.

Character 2 [en]: Interesting choice! Have you, er, calculated the cost implications yet, because, you know, managed services can get expensive at scale, but then again, I mean, the operational overhead savings might offset it? What's your current throughput looking like—millions of events per second?

Character 1 [en]: About 3 million events per second [delighted] during peak hours!

Character 2 [en]: That's substantial volume! So, basically, at that scale, well, how are you handling, uhh, backpressure when downstream systems can't keep up? We implemented circuit breakers but honestly I'm wondering if there's a better pattern you've discovered.

Character 1 [en]: We, um, built this custom buffering system with Redis Streams, kind of, as an overflow mechanism, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Redis Streams as a buffer—that's clever! Actually, have you, like, considered using Apache Pulsar's built-in tiered storage instead, or, I guess, does the Redis approach give you something specific? I'm always looking for new patterns to handle burst traffic.

Character 1 [en]: The Redis solution gives us [enunciating every word] fine-grained-control-over-retention-policies.

Character 2 [en]: Makes total sense for your use case! Speaking of retention, how are you managing state store cleanup in your stream processors? We had a nasty incident where RocksDB state stores grew unbounded and crashed our pods.

Character 1 [en]: Oh no, that sounds painful! We use changelog topic compaction pretty aggressively.

Character 2 [en]: Smart move! You know, the thing is, we're, hmm, also exploring using Flink's incremental checkpointing, but, actually, I'm curious—have you evaluated Flink versus Kafka Streams for your stateful processing needs? The checkpointing strategies are so different.

Character 1 [en]: We, uh, actually started with Flink but, well, switched to Kafka Streams for, basically, simpler deployment.

Character 2 [en]: That's fascinating because we went the opposite direction! So, err, what specific deployment challenges did you hit with Flink, because, honestly, we're finding the JobManager coordination, it's just that, it can be finicky? Did you have issues with savepoint compatibility during upgrades?

Character 1 [en]: The savepoint migrations were [very sad] absolutely brutal, um, especially with schema evolution, like, breaking everything constantly.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! Schema evolution in streaming is, uhh, such a pain point—are you using Avro with Schema Registry now, or, anyway, did you go with something like Protocol Buffers? We're actually debating whether the overhead of schema registry is worth the type safety.

Character 1 [en]: We're using Avro but, hmm, considering switching to, you know, Protocol Buffers for better performance, err, and smaller message sizes.

Character 2 [en]: Performance versus flexibility, the eternal trade-off! Quick question though—with Protocol Buffers, how would you handle backward compatibility for consumers that might be several versions behind? That's what's keeping us on Avro despite the overhead.
