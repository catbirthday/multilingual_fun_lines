Character 1 [en]: [playful] So you've been doing makeup for what, fifteen years now?

Character 2 [en]: Seventeen, actually—started when I was nineteen in a funeral home, believe it or not. Death teaches you about life; making the departed look peaceful taught me how to make the living look radiant.

Character 1 [en]: That's a dark beginning.

Character 2 [en]: Not dark, illuminating! See, corpses don't lie about their bone structure; they can't tense their muscles or fake expressions. You learn the architecture of a face when it's completely still.

Character 1 [en]: How'd you transition to fashion?

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Fashion found me, honestly—a photographer saw my mortuary work and said, "Anyone who can make death look that good should be working with models." Three weeks later I was backstage at Fashion Week with brushes shaking, surrounded by chaos, thinking what have I done?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] But you clearly thrived.

Character 2 [en]: Thriving is... a process. The living move, they sweat, they have opinions about coral versus peach. But here's the thing: makeup is sculpture with time limits—you're creating dimensional illusions that have to survive under lights, through tears, past midnight.

Character 1 [en]: What's your signature technique?

Character 2 [en]: I build faces like music: crescendo here, diminuendo there, staccato highlights, legato blending. Most artists paint; I compose—every face gets its own rhythm, its own tempo based on bone structure and personality.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds incredibly complex.

Character 2 [en]: Complex? No, it's intuitive once you understand that faces are just geography—hills, valleys, plains waiting for light and shadow. The complexity comes from reading the person inside the face; that's where the real artistry lives.

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] Sure, but isn't it basically just covering flaws?

Character 2 [en]: Flaws! There are no flaws, only features seeking their best light. What you call a flaw, I call character—a scar tells stories, asymmetry creates interest, texture gives depth that perfect smoothness never could.

Character 1 [en]: You've worked with some huge celebrities.

Character 2 [en]: Fame is irrelevant when someone's in my chair; we're all just skin and stories. Though I will say, the nervous energy of a first-time bride beats any A-lister's premiere jitters—that vulnerability is electric.

Character 1 [en]: Any disasters you can share?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, once I had exactly three minutes to fix a full face after a celebrity ugly-cried off everything right before walking the red carpet. Tissue, powder, precision—we made it work, and she looked luminous, tears transformed into dewy radiance.

Character 1 [en]: Do you ever get tired of it?

Character 2 [en]: Tired of transformation? Never. Every face is a blank canvas with infinite possibilities; every day I get to help people see themselves differently—more bold, more beautiful, more... themselves, just amplified.
