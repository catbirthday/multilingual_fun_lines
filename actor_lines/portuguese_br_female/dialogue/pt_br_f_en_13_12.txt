Character 1 [en]: So you're telling me Tuesday has feelings now? What's next, Wednesday's going through a midlife crisis?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, you joke, but consciousness permeates everything! Every vibration carries intention, every frequency holds memory—your coffee mug is literally singing its ceramic history right now if you'd just listen.

Character 1 [en]: My mug's been pretty quiet. Maybe it's giving me the silent treatment.

Character 2 [en]: That's because you're not [yawn] attuned yet! Most people hear maybe two percent of reality's soundtrack—the rest is background radiation, cosmic whispers, molecular jazz that your brain filters out for survival.

Character 1 [en]: Survival from jazz? That's a new evolutionary threat I hadn't considered.

Character 2 [en]: Not a threat, an invitation! Imagine if you suddenly heard every atom vibrating, every photon screaming past—you'd go mad in seconds, but what a glorious madness it would be!

Character 1 [en]: You're really selling the whole madness angle here. Should I be concerned?

Character 2 [en]: Concerned is such a [slurring] limited frequency! No no no, you should be exhilarated—we're living inside a massive composition that never repeats, never resolves, just keeps improvising itself into existence!

Character 1 [en]: Right, so, um, when you say improvising, I mean, are we talking like, cosmic free jazz here?

Character 2 [en]: Free jazz wishes it could be this [very sad] chaotic! The universe is, well, basically playing every possible song simultaneously, you know, and we're just... trapped in one melody thinking it's the only tune that exists.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, that's actually, er, kind of beautiful in a, I guess, terrifying way.

Character 2 [en]: Beautiful and terrifying are just, uh, different octaves of the same emotion, honestly! Like how love and fear both vibrate at—wait, the thing is, can you feel that? The air pressure just shifted three cents sharp!

Character 1 [en]: Oh absolutely, I was just [sarcastic] about to mention, you know, the air pressure's pitch, um, because that's totally something I notice, like, all the time.

Character 2 [en]: Mock all you want, but your, err, sarcasm resonates at exactly 328 hertz, which is, actually, E natural with a hint of—oh! basically, disappointment mixed with curiosity, it's quite lovely really!

Character 1 [en]: You can, well, hear my emotions? That's, uhh, either incredible or, kind of, the worst superpower ever.

Character 2 [en]: Superpower implies it's special, but everyone broadcasts their emotional frequencies constantly! You're practically screaming your feelings into the electromagnetic spectrum—I just happen to have the receiver tuned in.

Character 1 [en]: So what am I, like, broadcasting right now, hmm, emotionally speaking?

Character 2 [en]: Fascination fighting skepticism at 500 hertz, with undertones of genuine wonder trying to break through! Your frequency pattern is actually shifting upward—you're starting to believe me despite yourself, aren't you?

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I am, [very quietly] or maybe that's just, um, what you're hoping to, er, hear in there.

Character 2 [en]: Hope vibrates at 528 hertz—the exact frequency of DNA repair, transformation, miracles even! And right now? This entire room is humming with it, yours and mine creating harmonics that didn't exist five minutes ago.
