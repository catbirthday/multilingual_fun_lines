Character 1 [en]: So, um, I've been struggling with, you know, organizing my art collection and, well, tracking all the pieces I need to curate.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I mean, art curation is [joking] basically ninety percent spreadsheet management, but honestly, I've developed some workflows that, er, transform the whole process from chaos into something actually manageable!

Character 1 [en]: How do you even [stuttering] st-start with something like that?

Character 2 [en]: Well, first thing is, you know, establishing a single source of truth—like, one master database where, uhh, every artwork lives with standardized metadata including dimensions, medium, provenance, and exhibition history.

Character 1 [en]: I tried that once but [sad] lost everything when my computer crashed.

Character 2 [en]: Cloud-based systems are, hmm, absolutely essential! I use Airtable because, actually, it lets you create different views—gallery view for visual browsing, err, calendar view for exhibition planning, kanban boards for loan tracking.

Character 1 [en]: Could you, um, elaborate on the [formal] technical specifications of, well, such a system?

Character 2 [en]: Sure! Each artwork gets a unique identifier, high-res images at multiple angles, condition reports with timestamps, plus relational links to artists, collectors, exhibitions, and insurance documents all interconnected.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds incredibly complex to maintain.

Character 2 [en]: It's actually not [shy] too difficult once you establish the initial framework—automation handles most updates, and templates ensure consistency across new entries without manual repetition.

Character 1 [en]: What about physical workflow in the actual gallery space?

Character 2 [en]: QR codes are [chuckle] game-changers! Stick them on frames or storage crates, scan with your phone, instantly access and update the artwork's database entry right there on the floor.

Character 1 [en]: But, like, how do you manage, you know, multiple exhibitions happening, um, simultaneously?

Character 2 [en]: So, I use something called, well, pipeline visualization where each exhibition is, basically, a swim lane showing stages from concept to deinstallation—you can, uhh, spot bottlenecks immediately.

Character 1 [en]: Does this, er, system work for, I mean, smaller galleries too, or just, like, major institutions?

Character 2 [en]: Even tiny galleries benefit [shouting] MORE from good workflows because they can't afford inefficiency! Start simple with free tools like Notion or Google Sheets, then scale up as needed.

Character 1 [en]: You seem really [warm] passionate about making art accessible through better systems.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! When curators spend less time on logistics, they spend more time on what matters—discovering artists, crafting narratives, creating meaningful experiences for visitors.

Character 1 [en]: What's the biggest mistake you see curators making?

Character 2 [en]: Not documenting their processes! Like, they keep everything in their heads, which, um, makes them irreplaceable but also, you know, incredibly stressed and, honestly, [anxious] unable to delegate or take vacation!
