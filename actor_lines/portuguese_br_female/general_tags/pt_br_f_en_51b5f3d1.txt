=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Well, um, I suppose you don't, [measured], recognize me after thirty-two years, so I mean, [bitter], let me help you remember—I'm the son you, [hollow], left behind when mom got sick.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I knew you'd, [careful], find me eventually when I bought this land, though I didn't expect you to, [quiet], show up with a rifle on your shoulder. [exhales slowly]

Character 1 [en]: [harsh] You knew.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I've been tracking you for, well, [hesitant], years through social media and local newspapers, so I mean, [measured], I knew you were the hunting guide here, and maybe, [trailing off], that's partly why I chose this particular property.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, you've been watching me all this time and, [breaking], never once thought to reach out, well, not even when I nearly died in that avalanche three winters ago?

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] The lawyers advised me that any contact could, [careful], complicate the trust fund I set up for—

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Trust fund? You think money could ever, [voice rising], replace having a father at graduation or mom's funeral when she, [choking], finally lost her battle? [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [weary] I mean, no amount of money could fix what I, um, [regretful], broke when I left, but well, [desperate], I thought maybe securing your future was the least I could, [incomplete], do after failing at everything else. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [steady] So, um, what's your plan here—tear down these woods where I've guided hunters for, well, [tense], fifteen years and build another one of your, [disgusted], soulless developments?

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Actually, I bought it to, [deliberate], preserve it as a conservation area in your mother's name, though I suppose you'll, [resigned], think that's just another calculated move from the, [bitter], heartless mogul you've imagined me to be.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Mom's name? After you couldn't even be bothered to, [angry], show up when she was dying alone in that hospice, begging me to, [voice breaking], forgive you with her last breath?

Character 2 [en]: [broken] I was there—standing outside her window at, [barely audible], three in the morning every night that final week, watching you, [haunted], hold her hand while she slipped away, too much of a, [self-loathing], coward to walk through that door.

Character 1 [en]: She kept asking for you even when the, [pained], morphine made her forget my name, and I had to, [struggling], lie every single time that you were, [hollow], on your way.

Character 2 [en]: I know, um, because I heard everything through that, [ashamed], cracked window—every lie you told to comfort her.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] And you just stood there listening while I, [resentful], carried the weight of your absence alone, watching her, [cracking], search the doorway for you?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, standing in that darkness was my, [guilty], punishment, though I know it's nothing compared to what you, [incomplete], went through, and um, [desperate], what you're still going through.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, the worst part isn't that you left—it's that you, [measured], kept watching from the shadows like some, er, [disgusted], ghost who couldn't commit to being either present or gone.

Character 2 [en]: So, um, maybe that's exactly what I am—a ghost who, [hollow], doesn't deserve forgiveness but, well, [trailing off], can't quite let go either. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Mom's conservation area would need a, [thoughtful], local manager who knows the land.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Well, I mean, I was thinking maybe we could, [uncertain], start there—not as father and son, but just as two people trying to honor her memory.
