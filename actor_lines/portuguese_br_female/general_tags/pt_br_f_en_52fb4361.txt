=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [caught-off-guard] I didn't expect anyone to be, [tense], checking inventory at midnight but here you are with your, [precise], clipboard and flashlight catching me red-handed. [nervous laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You're the one who's been, um, [accusatory], cutting threads on the period costumes—I mean, I've been tracking this sabotage for, well, [furious], three weeks and it's cost us thousands.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, I know how this, um, [guilty], appears but there are things about your production company that, well, [desperate], you don't understand, things that would make you see this, I mean, [heavy], differently if you knew the truth. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] The truth is that you've been, [cold], systematically destroying hand-sewn garments that took our team, [disgusted], hundreds of hours to create, pieces that can't be, [shaking], replaced before opening night.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Your boss stole the contract for this show, um, [revealing], from my mother's costume company by spreading lies about her work, and, well, [cracking], she lost everything because of it.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Wait, your mother is Margaret Chen who, um, [recognizing], ran Chen Theatrical Designs—I mean, she was my mentor before the company, well, [softer], folded last year and I always wondered what, you know, [troubled], really happened.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] She taught me everything about costumes and, um, [breaking], now she can't even look at fabric without crying, so yeah, I mean, [vengeful], I wanted them to feel that same loss.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, I didn't know.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Well, I've been hiding in these storage rooms for, um, [hollow], weeks trying to hurt them the way they, I mean, [defeated], hurt her. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Margaret never mentioned having a, [careful], daughter but the way you handle fabric, even while, [observant], destroying it, shows her technique perfectly, those same, [wistful], precise movements she taught me.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] She talked about having a star student who, well, [calculating], understood construction better than anyone—wait, that was you, um, [realizing], you're the one she said would carry on her, I mean, [amazed], legacy.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Then we're both trying to honor her in completely wrong ways.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] The irony is that she'd be, [ashamed], horrified by what I've done, destroying the very art form she, [regretful], devoted her entire life to preserving and, [trembling], teaching to people like us.

Character 2 [en]: What if instead of, [thoughtful], destruction, we documented everything wrong this company did to, [strategic], expose them properly through the costume guild?

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] You mean you'd help me, well, [uncertain], even after what I've done to your work—I mean, um, why would you risk your job like that?

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Because Margaret Chen deserves justice and, um, [passionate], her daughter deserves to fight for it the right way, not by, well, I mean, [emphatic], becoming what destroyed her. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] I have emails and contracts that prove everything, [determined], documents my mother never knew I'd saved all this time.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] Then let's stop hiding in the dark and, [fierce], bring this into the light where your mother's reputation can be, [proud], restored properly instead of avenged through, [steady], shadows. [exhales deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] She always said her best student would, [moved], know exactly what to do.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] And she always said her family had the, [knowing], courage to fight for what's right, even if it meant, [gentle], standing alone—but you're not alone in this, [committed], anymore. [sighs]
