=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [breathlessly] Graças a Deus você chegou!

Character 2 [mix]: Você é a terceira pessoa que fala isso hoje, mas você parece mais desesperada que as outras. What's the situation exactly?

Character 1 [mix]: [urgently] A gente tem 40 toneladas de concrete mix parada naquela estrada de acesso, and if it freezes through, vamos perder tudo.

Character 2 [mix]: 40 toneladas? [low whistle] Isso é o quê, uns 250 mil? A prefeitura mandou eu limpar as ruas principais primeiro, standard protocol during a Level Three storm event.

Character 1 [mix]: Eu entendo protocolo, entendo mesmo, mas não é só sobre dinheiro—26 famílias tão contando com esse projeto pra ter trabalho no inverno. [voice cracking slightly]

Character 2 [mix]: [thoughtfully] 26 famílias. Sabe, a professora da minha filha vive falando que a escola precisa de reforma. This wouldn't happen to be the Riverside Elementary project?

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] Sim! É exatamente isso. A gente já tá duas semanas atrasada por causa das enchentes de outubro, e agora essa tempestade tá ameaçando tudo.

Character 2 [mix]: Minha Sophie tá na turma da Mrs. Henderson com os baldes pegando goteira do teto. [sighs] Olha, I can swing by your access road, mas preciso de 15 minutos.

Character 1 [mix]: [gratefully] 15 minutos tá perfeito. Minha equipe tá pronta com lonas e aquecedores, we just need the road clear enough to move the trucks.

Character 2 [mix]: Mas vou avisar—tô quase sem salt mix. Essa tempestade pegou todo mundo de surpresa, even the weather service. [chuckles dryly]

Character 1 [mix]: O que você puder fazer já ajuda.

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] Quer saber? Eu passo na frente daquela escola toda manhã há 3 anos vendo ela se deteriorar. Let's make sure those kids get their new building.

Character 1 [mix]: Você não tem ideia do que isso significa pra gente. O mestre de obras tá dormindo no caminhão há duas noites guardando os materiais do tempo.

Character 2 [mix]: Parece alguém que entende o que importa. [exhales] Tá bom, segue as luzes do meu caminhão, and tell your crew to be ready the second I clear that road.

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] Eles já tão aquecendo os equipamentos. Olha, quando tudo isso acabar, você tem que vir pra inauguração da escola—Sophie should see her parent as the hero who saved it.

Character 2 [mix]: Herói é exagero pra quem espalha sal, mas agradeço. [pause] Você disse que as enchentes de outubro atrasaram vocês—that was my crew that cleared the mud from your site.

Character 1 [mix]: [laughing with recognition] Pera, você que deixou o bilhete sobre o problema de drenagem no lado norte! A gente consertou por causa de você!

Character 2 [mix]: Cidade pequena quando você tá mantendo tudo funcionando, just different angles of it. Falando em ângulos, your access road has that sharp turn que vai precisar de atenção extra. [firmly]

Character 1 [mix]: Já tenho dois caras postados lá com baldes de areia, por precaução. We learned our lesson depois que aquele caminhão de entrega derrapou lá mês passado na chuva.

Character 2 [mix]: [impressed] Agora sim, pensando à frente. A maioria dos empreiteiros só aponta dedo quando as coisas dão errado. Me segue—let's go save your concrete and Sophie's new classroom. [starting engine]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [breathlessly] Thank God you're here!

Character 2: You're the third person to say that tonight, but you look more desperate than the others. What's the situation exactly?

Character 1: [urgently] We've got forty tons of concrete mix sitting on that access road, and if it freezes through, we're looking at a complete loss.

Character 2: Forty tons? [low whistle] That's what, quarter million worth? The city's got me hitting the main roads first, standard protocol during a Level Three storm event.

Character 1: I understand protocol, I really do, but this isn't just about money—twenty-six families are counting on this project for their jobs through winter. [voice cracking slightly]

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Twenty-six families. You know, my daughter's teacher keeps saying her school needs renovations. This wouldn't happen to be the Riverside Elementary project?

Character 1: [surprised] Yes! That's exactly what this is. We're already two weeks behind because of the October floods, and now this storm is threatening everything.

Character 2: My Sophie's in Mrs. Henderson's class with the buckets catching ceiling drips. [sighs] Look, I can swing by your access road, but I need fifteen minutes.

Character 1: [gratefully] Fifteen minutes is perfect. I've got my crew ready with tarps and heaters, we just need the road clear enough to move the trucks.

Character 2: Fair warning though—I'm running low on salt mix. This storm caught everyone off guard, even the weather service. [chuckles dryly]

Character 1: Whatever you can spare.

Character 2: [warmly] You know what? I've driven past that school every morning for three years watching it fall apart. Let's make sure those kids get their new building.

Character 1: You have no idea what this means to us. The foreman's been sleeping in his truck for two nights guarding those materials from the weather.

Character 2: Sounds like someone who understands what matters. [exhales] Alright, follow my truck's flashers, and tell your crew to be ready the second I clear that road.

Character 1: [determined] They're already warming up the equipment. Hey, when this is all over, I want you to come to the school's ribbon cutting ceremony—Sophie should see her parent as the hero who saved it.

Character 2: Hero's a bit much for spreading salt, but I appreciate that. [pause] You said October floods set you back—that was my crew that cleared the mud from your site.

Character 1: [laughing with recognition] Wait, you're the one who left the note about the drainage problem on the north side! We fixed that because of you!

Character 2: Small world when you're keeping the same town running, just different angles of it. Speaking of angles, your access road has that sharp turn that'll need extra attention. [firmly]

Character 1: I've got two guys posted there with sand buckets already, just in case. We learned our lesson after that delivery truck jackknifed there last month during the rain.

Character 2: [impressed] Now that's thinking ahead. Most contractors just point fingers when things go sideways. Follow me—let's go save your concrete and Sophie's new classroom. [starting engine]
