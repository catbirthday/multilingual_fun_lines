=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] So you're the lawyer who, [sharp], froze my mother's accounts yesterday, the one who said I can't even, [bitter], access the money she left specifically for keeping her shop running.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I had no idea you were, [uncomfortable], the daughter when I filed those papers, I mean, your last names are different and, [rushed], the estate documentation didn't mention, well, anything about the ice cream shop being, [trailing off], part of the inheritance.

Character 1 [en]: [accusatory] You've been coming here every single day for, [incredulous], a month straight ordering the same lavender honey cone, sitting in that corner booth and, [heated], telling me how this place reminds you of your childhood.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, it does remind me of, [quiet], my childhood, but that doesn't change the fact that legally, um, everything has to go through probate.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] So, um, all those conversations we had about, [sarcastic], keeping small businesses alive in this neighborhood, about how, well, important it is to preserve family legacies, I mean, that was just, [disgusted], what exactly?

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Those conversations were real, but, um, my professional obligations and, [measured], personal feelings are two entirely separate things, you know.

Character 1 [en]: Right, well, so you can compartmentalize perfectly while, [breaking], I'm about to lose everything my mother built over forty years, um, because of red tape.

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] Listen, there might be a way to, [hasty], expedite the process if you can prove the shop needs, [scrambling], immediate operational funds to prevent irreparable harm to the, [breathless], estate's value.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] And you're just now mentioning this option after, [cold], watching me panic for the last twenty-four hours?

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I couldn't discuss it until I verified you were actually, [careful], the beneficiary named in the will.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The freezer compressor dies in three days if I can't, [desperate], pay for repairs.

Character 2 [en]: [decisive] Then we file an emergency motion tomorrow morning at, [quick], eight sharp.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, I guess I should thank you, but honestly, [conflicted], I don't know whether to be grateful or, [struggling], furious that you're the reason I need help in the first place, you know, [hollow], this whole situation is just—

Character 2 [en]: [rushed] I'll waive my fees for the emergency filing and, [softer], personally guarantee the judge sees it before noon.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Why?

Character 2 [en]: [earnest] Because your mother's lavender honey recipe is, [emotional], the same one my grandmother made, and some things are worth, [determined], bending the rules for.

Character 1 [en]: You never told me that, um, during all those afternoons you sat here, [hurt], sharing stories about everything except, well, who you really were.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Professional boundaries are just another word for, [weary], cowardice sometimes.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, after we file this motion tomorrow, well, will you still come here for your, [tentative], daily cone, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Every day at two-thirty, just like, [hopeful], always, though maybe this time we can have an honest, [meaningful], conversation.
