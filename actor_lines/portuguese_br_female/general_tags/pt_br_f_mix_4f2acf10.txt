=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: Oi, então, eu percebi que você tá sentada aqui há, [gentle], um tempo e, bom, queria ver se você teria interesse em algo que poderia, é, realmente mudar as coisas.

Character 2 [mix]: [flatly] Eu não preciso, hmm, de seja lá o que você tá, [dismissive], vendendo, então, tipo, you can save your breath for someone who actually cares.

Character 1 [mix]: [earnest] Não não, quer dizer, não é sobre vender nada—a gente tá, [passionate], construindo algo real aqui, uma comunidade que realmente ajuda as pessoas a encontrar seu caminho.

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] Já encontrei meu caminho. [laughs darkly]

Character 1 [mix]: [softly] Todo mundo fica perdido às vezes.

Character 2 [mix]: É, [hollow], claro.

Character 1 [mix]: Olha, eu sei como, [careful], isso soa, mas, hmm, we've helped people who've been completely broken, e, bom, agora eles tão, [hopeful], liderando equipes eles mesmos.

Character 2 [mix]: Equipes do quê—outras, [sarcastic], pessoas quebradas fingindo que tão, [tired], consertadas?

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] Equipes de pessoas que, é, realmente se importam umas com as, [fierce], outras, que aparecem quando, [quieter], as coisas ficam difíceis, e, er, não simplesmente, [emotional], vão embora.

Character 2 [mix]: [weary] Hmm, parece exaustivo. [sighs]

Character 1 [mix]: [gently] É exaustivo ficar sozinha também, né? Quer dizer, sentada nesses, [knowing], degraus toda noite, watching everyone else have somewhere to go.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Você não sabe nada sobre, [shaking], mim ou por que eu tô aqui.

Character 1 [mix]: Você tem razão, eu não sei, mas, é, eu reconheço esse, [understanding], olhar—the one that says you've given up on believing anything matters anymore. [pauses]

Character 2 [mix]: [cracking] Tudo que eu acreditava, [trembling], acabou sendo mentira mesmo, então qual é, [angry], o sentido do seu exércitinho de salvação? [voice breaks]

Character 1 [mix]: O sentido é que, hmm, a gente não tá prometendo, [honest], salvação—we're just offering a chance to feel useful again, importar pra alguém.

Character 2 [mix]: [suspicious] E o que você, [hesitant], ganha com isso? Nobody does anything for free anymore. [scoffs]

Character 1 [mix]: [vulnerable] 3 anos atrás eu tava dormindo embaixo, [quiet], daquela ponte ali. [points]

Character 2 [mix]: [surprised] Você? Mas você parece tão, hmm, tipo você tem tudo, [confused], junto, quer dizer, you're out here trying to help people.

Character 1 [mix]: [genuine] Alguém sentou do meu lado uma noite e, [warm], não tentou me consertar—just invited me to help fix something else.

Character 2 [mix]: E isso realmente, [doubtful], funcionou?


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Hey there, um, I noticed you've been sitting here for, [gentle], a while and, well, I wanted to see if you'd be interested in something that could, uh, really change things.

Character 2: [flatly] I don't need, umm, whatever it is you're, [dismissive], selling, so, like, you can save your breath for someone who actually cares.

Character 1: [earnest] No no, I mean, it's not about selling anything—we're, [passionate], building something real here, um, a community that actually helps people find their way.

Character 2: [bitter] Found my way. [laughs darkly]

Character 1: [softly] Everyone's lost sometimes.

Character 2: Um, yeah, [hollow], right.

Character 1: Look, I know how, [careful], this sounds, but, umm, we've helped people who've been, [sincere], completely broken, and, well, they're now, [hopeful], leading teams themselves.

Character 2: Teams of what—other, [sarcastic], broken people pretending they're, [tired], fixed?

Character 1: [determined] Teams of people who, um, actually give a damn about, [fierce], each other, who show up when, [quieter], things get hard, and, er, don't just, [emotional], walk away.

Character 2: [weary] Umm, sounds exhausting. [sighs]

Character 1: [gently] It's exhausting being alone too, isn't it? I mean, sitting on these, [knowing], steps every evening, watching everyone else have somewhere to go.

Character 2: [defensive] You don't know anything about, [shaking], me or why I'm here.

Character 1: You're right, I don't, but, um, I recognize that, [understanding], look—the one that says you've given up on, [softer], believing anything matters anymore. [pauses]

Character 2: [cracking] Everything I believed in, [trembling], turned out to be lies anyway, so what's, [angry], the point of your little salvation army? [voice breaks]

Character 1: The point is that, umm, we're not promising, [honest], salvation—we're just offering a chance to, well, feel useful again, to matter to someone.

Character 2: [suspicious] And what do you, [hesitant], get out of it? Nobody does anything for, [cynical], free anymore. [scoffs]

Character 1: [vulnerable] Three years ago I was sleeping under, [quiet], that bridge over there. [points]

Character 2: [surprised] You? But you seem so, umm, like you've got it, [confused], together, I mean, you're out here trying to help people.

Character 1: [genuine] Someone sat next to me one night and, [warm], didn't try to fix me—just invited me to help fix, [meaningful], something else.

Character 2: And that actually, [doubtful], worked?
