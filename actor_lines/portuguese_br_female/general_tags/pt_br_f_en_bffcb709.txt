=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [frozen] Um, I'm here for the, uh, [voice cracking], smart home installation at two o'clock but I think there's been some kind of, [trembling], mistake because this is, well, [hollow], this is Ryan Mitchell's house.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, um, that's me and you're, [stunned], you're definitely Tommy from high school, the kid who used to, [uncomfortable], hide in the computer lab during lunch, right?

Character 1 [en]: I, um, well, I go by Thomas now and I own a, [professional], successful tech installation company with twelve employees. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [awkward] Look, I know things were, [shifting], rough back then but that was twenty years ago and we're both, [dismissive], different people now, right? [nervous laugh]

Character 1 [en]: You broke my arm in tenth grade and told everyone, [bitter], I fell down the stairs because I was too weak to walk properly.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Jesus, that was just stupid kid stuff and besides, [guilty], you turned out fine with your fancy business and, [trailing off], everything worked out. [clears throat]

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Um, well, I should go.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Wait, please.

Character 1 [en]: Um, you made my life hell for, well, [measured], four years straight and now you want me to wire your house with, [incredulous], smart speakers and security cameras?

Character 2 [en]: [struggling] I know, um, I mean, I get how this looks but my wife found your company online and she's, [embarrassed], eight months pregnant and we need this done before the baby comes and I didn't, [defeated], even know it was your company, okay?

Character 1 [en]: [firm] The deposit is non-refundable but I can send, [detached], one of my technicians instead if you still want the work done because there's no way, [resolute], I'm stepping foot in this house again.

Character 2 [en]: Um, listen, I've been in therapy for, like, [confession], five years dealing with who I was back then. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [flat] Good for you.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] My therapist says I was acting out because my dad was, [voice breaking], beating the shit out of me every night but that doesn't excuse what I did to you and, [genuine], others who didn't deserve any of it. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] Well, um, that's really unfortunate about your father but it doesn't, [hardening], change the fact that you chose to pass that violence onto me and made me believe I was, [bitter], worthless for years.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] I know and there's nothing I can say that will, [broken], undo any of it. [silence]

Character 1 [en]: I still wake up sometimes, um, [haunted], thinking I'm back in that hallway with you and your friends surrounding me and I can't, [shaking], breathe and my wife has to remind me that I'm safe now, that I'm, well, [exhausted], somebody who matters.

Character 2 [en]: [remorseful] Um, I'm sorry, I mean really, truly sorry and I know that's, [defeated], pathetically inadequate but it's all I have and if you want to leave right now, [resigned], I completely understand.

Character 1 [en]: Um, your wife doesn't know about any of this, [tired], does she? [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: No, she just knows I was an asshole teenager but not the, [ashamed], specifics of what I did to people like you who deserved so much, [breaking], better than what they got.
