=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [frozen] The academy said I'd be meeting with the event coordinator to, [shaky voice], finalize the spring gala catering details but they didn't mention it would be—

Character 2 [en]: Alex, I didn't know they'd, [uncomfortable], assigned you to this account or I would have asked another teacher to, [retreating], handle the coordination because this is obviously, [strained], complicated.

Character 1 [en]: Right, well, um, we're both professionals here and, [clearing throat], this is the biggest contract my company has landed this year so, [steady], I mean, we can manage forty-five minutes of, [hollow], menu planning without—

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Five years and you still do that thing where you, [affectionate], pretend everything's just business when your hands are literally, [observant], trembling against that portfolio you're gripping like, [gentle], a life raft.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Maybe my hands are cold from the, [bitter], February weather or maybe I had too much coffee this morning because contrary to what you might, [wavering], think, not everything in my life revolves around, [breaking], our history.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] You started drinking coffee after I left because you said it, [knowing], reminded you of those Sunday mornings when I'd practice piano and you'd, [nostalgic], plan menus at our kitchen table with the sun streaming through, [wistful], those gauze curtains.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Please, [cracking], don't.

Character 2 [en]: [controlled] You're right, that was unfair of me to, [apologetic], bring up and we should focus on the gala which needs, [professional], to showcase our students' talents while your food creates the perfect, [measured], ambiance for our donors. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: I was thinking, um, we could do stations that, [uncertain], correspond with each musical performance so like, [creative], when the strings play we serve delicate canapés and, well, [trailing off], during the jazz ensemble maybe something more bold and unexpected.

Character 2 [en]: That's actually, [surprised], brilliant and exactly the kind of thoughtful detail our board loves.

Character 1 [en]: [eager] Well, I mean, I remember how you always said music should be, [passionate], experienced with all the senses not just hearing, um, and food can be its own kind of, [inspired], composition if you approach it with the right, uhh, artistic mindset.

Character 2 [en]: [touched] You actually listened to all my rambling about, [tender], synesthesia and sensory integration even when, um, I thought you were just humoring me while I went on about, [emotional], how a C major chord tastes like vanilla, well, and minor keys feel like dark chocolate melting.

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] I listened to everything you said, um, even when you told me you were, [hurt], leaving because this place offered you the teaching position you'd, well, dreamed about since you were twelve.

Character 2 [en]: The position wasn't the only reason I left and, um, we both know that even though, [regretful], we've spent five years pretending it was just about, well, geography and career opportunities.

Character 1 [en]: [intense] Then tell me the real reason because I've spent, [desperate], sixty months trying to understand what I did wrong or what I could have, [searching], done differently.

Character 2 [en]: [painful] You didn't do anything wrong, um, that was the problem—you were so perfect at loving me that I, well, never learned who I was outside of us.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] So you destroyed us because I, um, loved you too well?

Character 2 [en]: I left because I was disappearing into, [aching], your dreams and forgetting I had my own, well, and now look—you have the city's most successful catering company and, um, I teach kids to find their voices through music. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] We both got what we wanted then, just not, [sad], what we wanted together which I suppose is its own kind of, [accepting], success story.

Character 2 [en]: The gala is three weeks away and we'll need, [closing off], to meet twice more to finalize everything.
