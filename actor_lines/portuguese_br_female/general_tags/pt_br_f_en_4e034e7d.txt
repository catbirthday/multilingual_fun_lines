Scenario: A dark knight, wounded after battle, reluctantly seeks treatment from a podiatrist after stepping on cursed thorns that are slowly turning his foot to stone.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [concerned] Sir, I need you to remove your armor plating from the knee down so I can properly examine the affected area—those thorns are already causing visible discoloration.

Character 2 [en]: The armor stays until I know whether you're capable of handling what lies beneath it, healer. [low growl] These are no ordinary wounds from garden thorns.

Character 1 [en]: [professionally calm] I've been practicing podiatric medicine for fifteen years, and while I typically deal with bunions and plantar fasciitis, tissue necrosis is tissue necrosis regardless of its origin. [pause] Please, let me help you.

Character 2 [en]: [darkly amused] You speak of bunions while my flesh turns to stone with each passing hour, spreading like frost across a windowpane in winter's grip.

Character 1 [en]: Stone transformation actually follows predictable vascular pathways—see how it's moving along your superficial peroneal nerve? [exhales] We might be able to slow it with targeted nerve blocks.

Character 2 [en]: [grimly] Every healer who's attempted to treat this has lost their mind or their life, sometimes both in the same screaming moment.

Character 1 [en]: [steadily] I understand the risks.

Character 2 [en]: No, you truly don't, but your ignorance might be the only thing keeping your hands steady enough to attempt what others couldn't.

Character 1 [en]: Fair enough.

Character 2 [en]: [ominously quiet] The thorns came from the Shadowbriar, a place where even death fears to tread, where the ground itself hungers for warm blood to feed its roots.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtfully] Shadowbriar—I've read about it in some alternative medicine journals, actually, something about the thorns containing a crystalline neurotoxin that responds to electrical stimulation. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [sharp intake] You know of it?

Character 1 [en]: Only what I've read, but if the toxin responds to electrical current, we could try iontophoresis to draw it out through the pores before it fully crystallizes your circulatory system.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly desperate] Three days I've carried this curse, watching my own body betray me inch by inch, and you speak of drawing it out like venom from a snake bite.

Character 1 [en]: It's more complex than that, obviously, but the principle is sound—we'd need to create a negative charge differential to pull the crystalline particles through your dermal layers. [nervous laugh] Never thought I'd use my equipment this way.

Character 2 [en]: [menacingly soft] If you fail, podiatrist, the curse will recognize you as part of my flesh and claim you too, spreading through your hands like wildfire. [pause] Still willing to help?

Character 1 [en]: [resolutely] I became a doctor to heal people, and right now you need healing more than anyone who's walked through that door in my entire career.

Character 2 [en]: [removing armor with metallic scraping] Then witness what your medical journals could never capture—flesh becoming mineral, blood crystallizing into geometric patterns that mock the very concept of life. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [professionally focused] The transformation pattern is actually quite beautiful in a terrifying way, like watching fractals form in real-time, but we need to act quickly before it reaches your tibial artery. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [grimly appreciative] You're either the bravest fool I've encountered or the only healer worthy of attempting this task—either way, podiatrist, my fate rests in your peculiarly steady hands.
