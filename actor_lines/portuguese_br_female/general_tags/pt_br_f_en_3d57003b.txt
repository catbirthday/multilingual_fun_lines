Scenario: A longtime backup singer meets with the fan club manager after their first night performing as lead when the star canceled last minute due to illness.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [breathless] Um, I can't believe I just, [triumphant], performed the entire show as lead, I mean, after five years of, [overwhelmed], standing in the shadows singing harmony.

Character 2 [en]: [tense] Well, the forums are, um, already exploding with opinions about whether you, [careful], deserved that standing ovation or if they were just being polite. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Excuse me, um, I've been rehearsing every, [hurt], single one of those songs for years, memorizing every breath and, [passionate], inflection while she barely showed up to, [bitter], well, half the rehearsals.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I know you've been, [frustrated], waiting for this moment, but the fans paid to see her, not, [blunt], well, the backup singer stepping into her designer shoes.

Character 1 [en]: [sharp] Oh, so, um, you're saying I should have what, [incredulous], just let the show get canceled instead of, like, saving everyone's night including, [sarcastic], your precious ticket sales? [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [conceding] The numbers don't lie though, [impressed], you did hit every note perfectly tonight. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, I've been studying her every, [intense], move for five years, learning how to, [revealing], disappear behind her voice while, well, secretly knowing I could, [confident], do it better.

Character 2 [en]: [provoking] Better is a strong word, I mean, considering she's sold, [challenging], fifty million albums and you've been, um, well, [dismissive], harmonizing in the background since, [pointed], 2019. [chuckles dryly]

Character 1 [en]: Fifty million albums doesn't mean, [fierce], she can still hit those high notes without auto-tune anymore.

Character 2 [en]: That's a dangerous accusation to make, [warning], especially when I control what the fan club hears about tonight's performance.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] You saw that crowd tonight, how they, [building], responded when I held that final note for twelve seconds without, [proud], wavering, without any technical assistance, just, [emotional], raw talent finally unleashed. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: [softer] I have to admit, um, when you changed the arrangement in, [admitting], the bridge of that last song, it was, well, pretty incredible.

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] That arrangement, um, was actually something I wrote, [confessing], three years ago when I thought, well, maybe she'd let me contribute more than just, [wistful], harmonies to the show. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [curious] She never even looked at it, [surprised], did she?

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Never even, um, opened the folder I left on her dressing table.

Character 2 [en]: The fan club president just texted me saying tonight's, [amazed], performance is already trending at number one worldwide. [stunned]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] So maybe, um, they don't need her as much as everyone thought.

Character 2 [en]: [contemplative] Well, um, the label is calling an emergency meeting tomorrow about, [meaningful], potentially restructuring the whole tour.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Then I guess tonight wasn't just, [fierce], my first night as lead after all.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] No, I suppose, um, it was more like, [acknowledging], your audition for the rest of your life. [exhales slowly]
