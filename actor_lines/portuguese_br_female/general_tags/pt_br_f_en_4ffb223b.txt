=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Jesus, Mike.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, it's been, [awkward pause], four years since graduation and here we are, [ironic], on opposite sides of your company's hostile takeover.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] So, um, when they brought in your firm for the PR campaign, I mean, did you know it was, [conflicted], my company you'd be, well, essentially helping to destroy?

Character 2 [en]: [self-assured] Of course I knew, and honestly, [measured], I specifically requested this account because I figured, [careful], you'd rather deal with me than some stranger.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Right, so, um, the guy who used to, [nostalgic], steal my ramen in our dorm is now, well, crafting the narrative that'll make thirty thousand employees, er, including me, look like, [hollow], corporate villains. [laughs darkly]

Character 2 [en]: Look, this isn't personal, it's just, [defensive], how the game works now and you, [resigned], knew that when you chose this life.

Character 1 [en]: Um, you know what's funny is that, [contemplative], we both swore we'd never become, well, these people, I mean, the ones who'd sell out anyone for, [disgusted], the right price.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] We grew up.

Character 1 [en]: [leaning forward] The acquisition documents show your firm is getting, [calculating], twelve million just for the PR spin, which means your personal cut is probably, [knowing], what, two million at least?

Character 2 [en]: Two point three actually, and before you, [matter-of-fact], judge me, remember who taught me about leverage back in college.

Character 1 [en]: [reflective] Yeah, well, I taught you about leverage for, um, negotiating better grades, not for, er, destroying people's livelihoods.

Character 2 [en]: [sharp] Oh please, um, don't pretend you haven't, [accusatory], made your millions by betting against companies and, well, watching them fail, I mean, that's literally, [emphatic], what you do every day on that trading floor.

Character 1 [en]: There's a difference between trading securities and actively, [intense], manufacturing consent for a corporate raid.

Character 2 [en]: The only difference is that I'm, [frank], honest about what I do. [exhales sharply]

Character 1 [en]: [softer] Remember when we used to stay up all night, [wistful], planning how we'd change the system from the inside?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, well, turns out the system is really good at, [cynical], changing you first, and, um, the money helps you forget, [quieter], why you ever wanted to fight it anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] I have recordings of every insider conversation about, [dangerous], this takeover that would sink your whole campaign. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [intrigued] Well, that's, um, interesting because I have, [confident], screenshots of your after-hours trades that, you know, the SEC would find, [deliberate], very illuminating. [grins]

Character 1 [en]: So we're both holding guns to each other's heads now, [bemused], just like old times playing Risk at three AM.

Character 2 [en]: [laughing] Except now, um, the stakes are real and, well, we both know, [serious], neither of us will pull the trigger. [sighs heavily]
