=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm... what's the word... disputing? Um, there's this chargeback thing and, uh, I know you're just doing your job here.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, um, let me just—I need to pull that up. Can you, uh, give me your account number or, er, maybe the transaction ID if you have it?

Customer [en]: Yeah it's, um... hold on... TRN-4428-BC. Sorry, I'm just, uh, really stressed about this whole thing.

Customer Support [en]: No no, I totally, um, I understand. So I'm seeing transaction TRN-4428-BC here and, uh, there's a chargeback filed on October 15th for, hmm, $847.92. I wish I could just—sorry, let me check what options we have.

Customer [en]: Eight hundred? That's... that's my insulin money.

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Oh gosh. Okay. Let me see what—I mean, I'm looking at case number CHG-90122-X and. The system shows. Initial review pending. Status.

Customer [en]: Um, look, I delivered everything. The, uh... what's it called... the tracking? Um, shows delivered, signed for, everything.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so I can see, um, tracking number TRK-556633-AA shows delivered October 2nd, and there's a, uh, signature from—wait, no sorry, that's October 3rd. But yeah, definitely delivered.

Customer [en]: Can you, um, can you fix this? I mean, uh, I know it's not your fault the system's like this.

Customer Support [en]: I really, really wish I could just, um, reverse this right now but, uh, the chargeback process is—it's handled by, hmm, a different department. Case CHG-90122-X needs to go through their review and I'm—I'm so frustrated I can't do more.

Customer [en]: My kid needs that medication. Next week.

Customer Support [en]: Okay. I'm going to. Escalate this. Priority one. Medical necessity flag on case CHG-90122-X. That should expedite to 24-48 hours instead of the normal two weeks.

Customer [en]: Um, two weeks is the normal? That's, uh... god, thank you for, um, making it faster.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah it's—it's ridiculous, I know. I'm also, um, I'm adding all your delivery proof to file DOC-7789-M right now, so they'll have the, uh, the signature, tracking, everything when they review.

Customer [en]: You're really, um, you're being so helpful. I'm sorry I'm such a, uh, mess about this.
