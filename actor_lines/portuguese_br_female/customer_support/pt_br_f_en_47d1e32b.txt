=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, yeah so I'm just—hmm, I guess I'm not getting my, uh, my codes? The two-factor thing?

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it. So let me pull up your account here, what I need first is your email address and then I can check the authentication logs in system ACC-7294-B.

Customer [en]: It's, um, let me think—no wait, actually it's, uh, jsmith at, um, techmail dot com.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay so, um, I'm seeing here that, uh, hmm, there've been seventeen attempts in the last, um, probably about two hours on account USR-88456-JX and, uh, none of them completed, so that's definitely, um, not right.

Customer [en]: Seventeen? I tried maybe five times.

Customer Support [en]: Right right so, um, what happens is, uh, the system sometimes, hmm, it sort of retries on its own when there's a, um, a delivery failure, you know? Let me check SMS gateway SGW-4419-Q here.

Customer [en]: Just need to get in. That's all.

Customer Support [en]: Um, so I'm seeing, uh, hmm, let me see here... okay so your number ending in 7749 is, um, is marked active but there's a, uh, carrier block code CBK-9902 showing up.

Customer [en]: Carrier block? I've been—no wait, um, I've had this number for, uh, probably eight years? Maybe nine?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah yeah absolutely, so what happens sometimes is carriers update their spam filters and legitimate codes get caught, happens with authentication messages all the time, I can override this with bypass protocol BYP-3847-MK.

Customer [en]: Um, so that's—hmm, okay so that means what? I just, uh, wait? Or...?

Customer Support [en]: No no, so I'm actually fixing it right now, just need about thirty seconds here to push override OVR-6623-PT through the gateway and reset your authentication preferences.

Customer [en]: I've been a customer for, um, for six years? And I'm just—I mean, uh, this shouldn't happen, right?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely shouldn't happen. Got your override processed, now I'm generating a test code TCX-994502 to verify the pathway's clear.

Customer [en]: Six years and I can't even, um, can't just log in? It's sort of, uh, ridiculous?

Customer Support [en]: Test went through perfect. You should get codes instantly now, and I've added priority flag PRF-8826-VL to your account so this won't happen again.

Customer [en]: Hmm, let me, uh, let me try it now then—no wait, um, should I wait? Or just...?

Customer Support [en]: Try it right now while I'm here, that way if there's any issue I can fix it immediately with elevated access token TKN-55439-RD that I've got active.

Customer [en]: Got it. Worked.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect, and just so you know I've documented everything under case number CSE-77812-QM with a full credit for today's inconvenience, should post within twenty-four hours to your account.
