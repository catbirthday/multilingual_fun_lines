Scenario: tree trimmer, angry about a liability insurance rate increase with no prior notice

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so basically I just got my bill and it's, uh, way higher than... I mean, what's going on?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Hi there! Let me just—actually wait—I need to pull up your account first. Could I get your policy number? It should start with POL dash something.

Customer [en]: It's, er, POL-4478-TM.

Customer Support [en]: POL-4478-TM. Got it. Okay so—hmm—I'm seeing here that, um, your liability coverage for the tree trimming business did have a, uh, pretty significant adjustment and I think—no wait—let me check the effective date here.

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, significant? Try, uh, double. And nobody told me anything...

Customer Support [en]: Right. Right. I see. The increase. From eight hundred. To sixteen hundred monthly. That's—I mean that's definitely—wow. I'm really. Really sorry. About that.

Customer [en]: So like, can you just, um, fix it?

Customer Support [en]: So the thing is—and I'm, um, really sorry about this—but the rate adjustment REF-2024-11892 was, uh, triggered by industry-wide changes and I think—actually let me just—I can see why you're upset because there should've been notice.

Customer [en]: Industry-wide? What's that even...

Customer Support [en]: Basically. Tree trimming. High risk category. Updated last quarter. The memo MEM-Q3-2024 shows, um, increased claims across the board so everyone in code CAT-77B got adjusted.

Customer [en]: Um, okay but like, I haven't had any claims, so...

Customer Support [en]: No no you're right! You're absolutely right and that's, um, that's actually good because I think—wait let me—okay so with your clean record I can probably submit form FRM-8823-RC for a, uh, a review and maybe get you some kind of discount applied.

Customer [en]: Er, how long's that gonna, uh, take? I can't afford this...

Customer Support [en]: Typically? Five days. But. But! I could—hmm—I could mark it priority. Code PRI-EXPRESS. That drops it. To maybe. Two days? Three max.

Customer [en]: Um, that'd help, yeah. So like, you can do that?

Customer Support [en]: Already doing it! So I'm, um, entering the priority request right now under ticket TKT-99412-X and, uh, I'm also gonna add a note about the missing notification because that's—I mean that's on us and maybe that helps your case.

Customer [en]: Okay so, um, what happens if they say no?

Customer Support [en]: Well. Honestly? I think—I mean I probably shouldn't say this but—with your record and our, um, our mistake on the notice, I'd be really surprised if they don't at least offer something. Case number CSE-7749-LP for your reference.

Customer [en]: Um, alright. Thanks for, uh, actually helping instead of just... you know.

Customer Support [en]: Of course! Of course! And hey—I'm putting my direct extension EXT-4491 in your file notes so, um, if you need to follow up just ask for me directly and I'll, uh, I'll make sure we get this sorted out properly.
