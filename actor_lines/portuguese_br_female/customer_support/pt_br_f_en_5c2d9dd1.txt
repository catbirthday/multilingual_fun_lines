=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm—I'm sorry, this is probably, uh, really stupid but I need—I need to ask about getting, um, a transcript?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Um, hi there! Welcome to, uh, customer support and—and absolutely, that's not stupid at all, we get, um, transcript requests all the time actually, so let me just, uh, pull up your account here—what's the... what's the word... the reference number for your previous call?

Customer [en]: I don't—I don't have it. Sorry. I'm just...

Customer Support [en]: No no, that's totally fine, really! So we can definitely look it up using your account number instead, which would be ACC-prefix and then eight digits, or if you remember roughly when you called in, I can search by date range too.

Customer [en]: Oh god, um, I'm—I'm so bad at this, uh, it was maybe, um, last week? Tuesday? Or—or wait, no, actually...

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, so, um, let me just—hmm, I'm pulling up, uh, all interactions from last week here and, um, I can see—oh! There's a call on Tuesday at, uh, 2:47 PM with ticket number TKT-8847-QM92, was that—was that the one?

Customer [en]: Maybe? I just—I just can't remember what we...

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so that call was regarding a billing question about your subscription renewal, lasted about twelve minutes with agent Sarah, and the resolution code was RSL-4429-XK if that helps jog your memory?

Customer [en]: Um, yes! Yes yes, that's—that's it, I'm sorry, I should've, uh, written it down or, um, I don't know why I didn't...

Customer Support [en]: Oh no no, please don't, um, don't apologize! So like, uh, most people don't save these and honestly? Um, that's what we're here for, so let me just, uh, generate that transcript for you—it'll have reference ID TRS-9902-LMP and, um, should take about... hmm... thirty seconds?

Customer [en]: Thirty seconds? That's—that's fast.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah! We actually upgraded our system last month, so transcripts generate way faster now—okay, perfect, I can see it's ready with document number DOC-7734-RT88 and I can either email it or read you the key points?

Customer [en]: Could you, um, email it? I'm—I'm probably too, uh, scattered to write anything down right now and I'll just, um, mess it up again...

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, um, of course! So I'm, uh, sending it right now to your email on file—that's the one ending in, um, at gmail right? And the email will have, uh, confirmation code CNF-8847-PP for your records.

Customer [en]: Yes. Gmail. Thank you, I just—sorry for being such a...

Customer Support [en]: You're doing great, really! The email subject line will say "Transcript Request TRS-9902-LMP" and it includes the full conversation plus any reference numbers that were mentioned during that call.

Customer [en]: Um, okay, I think—I think I see it coming through? Yeah, there's, uh, an attachment? Is that—um, is that right?

Customer Support [en]: Yes yes, perfect! So that's, um, that PDF attachment is your transcript with, uh, security watermark ID WMK-3392-QQT7, and um, just so you know for next time? You can always, uh, request these through your online account too under the... what's it called... the "History" tab.

Customer [en]: Oh. I didn't even... Of course there's an easier way. I'm just...

Customer Support [en]: Hey, honestly? Now you know for next time, and that's what matters! Is there anything else about that transcript or the original call from Tuesday that you need help with today?
