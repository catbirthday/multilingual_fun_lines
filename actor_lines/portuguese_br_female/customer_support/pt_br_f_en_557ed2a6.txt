=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so I'm looking at your tree service package TSP-9902 and, uh, there's something really wrong here.

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Um, okay so let me just—wait, let me pull that up—TSP-9902, um, right right, I've got it here. So, uh, what seems to be the—I mean, er, what's concerning you about it?

Customer [en]: Says you top trees. For health. That's not—that kills them.

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Oh um. So I'm—let me just, uh, double check this description here because, um, I want to make sure I'm reading this correctly. It says, er, "crown topping for optimal tree health" under service code SVC-4481-B?

Customer [en]: Right. That's backwards. Um, topping, uh, it causes decay, weak growth. Like, massive stress response.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so—hmm, this is—I'm not the tree expert here but, um, you're saying this is actually, er, harmful? Let me just—I need to flag this, reference number REF-77234-QM.

Customer [en]: Twenty years certified. It's harmful. Very.

Customer Support [en]: Right. Right okay. So um, between you and me? I think—no wait—I think someone in marketing, uh, really messed this up. Let me, er, get incident report INC-9958-KL started here.

Customer [en]: Um, also says, uh, "fertilize in late fall." That's, um, that encourages growth before frost. Bad idea.

Customer Support [en]: Oh man. Okay so—I'm just—wow. Um, documenting that too under, uh, the same incident. So you're—you're actually an arborist? Like, er, professionally?

Customer [en]: ISA certified. Your whole program's wrong.

Customer Support [en]: This is—okay I'm, um, actually really glad you called because, er, this could've been bad. So your account, uh, ACC-5847-TN9, I'm adding expert consultant notes.

Customer [en]: Can someone fix it? Before you—before people actually book this?

Customer Support [en]: Yes! Um, absolutely. So I'm—let me just—I'm escalating this to, er, product team right now with priority flag PRI-HIGH-8823. They should, uh, pull it offline within, hmm, thirty minutes?

Customer [en]: Good. Um, the pruning schedule's wrong too. Says, uh, spring for oaks.

Customer Support [en]: Spring for—oh no. That's, um, that's not right either is it? I'm just—wow we really, er, botched this entire thing. Adding that to case CSE-10947-RX.

Customer [en]: Oak wilt season. Never spring. Ever.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. Never spring. So, um, look—I'm gonna, uh, put you down as technical reviewer if that's okay? Reference code REV-6623-LP. Maybe we can, er, prevent this next time?

Customer [en]: Sure. Yeah. That'd—that'd actually help.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect! So, um, I've got everything documented under master ticket MST-8874-QQM and, uh, honestly? Between us? You probably just, er, saved us from a bunch of lawsuits. So, um, thank you.
