Scenario: asking why their gift card balance shows zero

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I received a gift card for my birthday last week. The balance is showing as zero even though it should have fifty dollars.

Customer Support [en]: I understand your concern and I'll help you resolve this immediately. May I have the gift card number located on the back of the card, starting with GC?

Customer [en]: The number is GC-4829-7361-9042. I haven't used it at all.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I'm pulling up gift card GC-4829-7361-9042 in our system now. I can see it was activated on October 12th with a fifty dollar balance as you mentioned.

Customer [en]: That's correct. So where did the balance go?

Customer Support [en]: I see what happened here. There was a transaction on October 14th at 3:47 PM Eastern for exactly fifty dollars at one of our online checkout systems.

Customer [en]: That wasn't me. I haven't even tried to use the card yet.

Customer Support [en]: I understand completely. Let me check the transaction details including the order number ORD-9847-ZM and the IP address 192.168.45.227 that was used for this purchase.

Customer [en]: Could someone have used my card number without my knowledge?

Customer Support [en]: That's a possibility I'm investigating. The transaction shows delivery to an address in ZIP code 44107, which is Cleveland, Ohio. Does this location sound familiar to you?

Customer [en]: No, I live in Phoenix. This is definitely fraudulent.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you for confirming. I'm immediately flagging this transaction as unauthorized and initiating case number FRD-2024-10-8847 for our fraud prevention team to investigate further.

Customer [en]: What happens now? Will I get my fifty dollars back?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I'm processing a full refund right now and issuing you a replacement gift card with number GC-4829-7361-9043, which will have the full fifty dollar value restored.

Customer [en]: How long will this take? I was planning to use it this weekend.

Customer Support [en]: Of course. The new gift card will be active within the next two hours, and you'll receive an email confirmation to the address on file ending in @gmail.com with all the details.

Customer [en]: That works. Should I destroy the compromised gift card?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, please destroy the physical card. I've already deactivated gift card GC-4829-7361-9042 in our system at 10:34 AM today, so it cannot be used again.

Customer [en]: Perfect. Is there anything else you need from me for the investigation?

Customer Support [en]: Everything is handled on our end. Your case FRD-2024-10-8847 will be reviewed by our security team, and if we need additional information, we'll contact you at the phone number ending in 7723.
