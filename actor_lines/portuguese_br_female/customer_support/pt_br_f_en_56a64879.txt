Customer [en]: So basically I've been—I've been a customer for like eight years and um, this is just—[exhales]—it's it's unacceptable.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, okay so let me just—no wait, actually first—um, I'm pulling up your account here and, uh, I can see you've been with us since 2016, account number ACC-4521-JN09, and um, wow yeah that's—that's a long time, so let me really dig into what's happening here.

Customer [en]: Yeah yeah exactly, so like, how do I know you're not just—just saying that?

Customer Support [en]: No no, I get it—I mean, er, you've probably heard that before, but um, here's what I'm actually—wait let me just—okay so I'm looking at ticket TKT-89204-VX and, uh, I can see three attempts to resolve this that just, hmm, they didn't really address the core issue at all.

Customer [en]: Wait wait wait, you—you actually see that? You see see what happened?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, yeah so um, looking at the notes here from, uh, let me see—October 14th, reference REF-7739-QM, then October 20th, and um, again on the 23rd, and honestly? Each time they just, er, they gave you the standard response without actually—no wait, let me rephrase—they didn't investigate what was really going on.

Customer [en]: [Sharp inhale] That's—that's exactly right, so so maybe you actually, um, like you get it?

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: So basically can you—can you fix this or, um, or is this just more—more of the same?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so here's what I'm—no actually, let me start differently—um, I'm going to handle this personally, like your case number CSE-5592-RL88 is now, uh, flagged in my personal queue, and um, instead of just passing you to another department, I'm gonna, er, walk through each step with you right now, is that—is that okay?

Customer [en]: Um yeah, I mean, like, that's that's what I've been asking for this whole—whole time!

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: So so what happens—what happens next exactly? Like specifically?

Customer Support [en]: So first thing—er, actually wait, let me just—okay so first I'm issuing an immediate credit, transaction TXN-990847-BC, that's, um, that's already processing, should hit your account in like, uh, two to three hours, and then—then we tackle the actual problem which is, hmm, your service configuration got corrupted somehow.

Customer [en]: [Exhales] Okay okay, but but how do I know this is, um, actually happening?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, totally fair question—I'm gonna, uh, send you an email right now with confirmation code CNF-4456-TT92, and er, you'll see my direct extension, it's—wait let me make sure—yeah it's extension 4479, and um, if anything seems off, you just, you call me directly, not the main line.

Customer [en]: You're—you're giving me your actual, like, your direct number? Really really?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely.

Customer [en]: I just—[breath catch]—I can't believe someone's finally, um, finally actually listening and and doing something!

Customer Support [en]: No no, hey, I get it—I mean, er, eight years is a long time to be loyal to us, and um, looking at your history here, profile ID PRF-2234-NK55, you've been, uh, incredibly patient through multiple issues, so like, the least I can do is—no wait, what I mean is—it's my job to actually fix this properly this time.
