=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Wait, they said—they said it'd be fixed. Monday. That was Monday.

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Let me pull up your account here. I see your customer ID is CUS-4492-NV and... okay okay, I'm looking at the notes from your call on Monday, November 18th. Can you tell me what resolution they promised you?

Customer [en]: The refund. Thirty percent. Said it'd show up.

Customer Support [en]: Right, I see it here now. They approved a thirty percent refund on order RFN-8823-QM for the damaged items. That should have been processed within 24 to 48 hours. But I'm... I'm not seeing it actually went through on our end.

Customer [en]: Not seeing—wait wait, what? Really?

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know this is frustrating. Let me dig deeper into this. Sometimes our system... honestly, it's kind of terrible with these automatic refunds. Your case number was CS-20241118-447 and yeah, it just never triggered.

Customer [en]: So they just, what, forgot? I don't—I don't get it.

Customer Support [en]: It's not that they forgot exactly. Our rep Sarah did everything right on her end. Put in all the codes correctly. It's just... the system probably glitched between departments. I see this maybe twice a week and it drives me crazy too.

Customer [en]: Wait, really? This happens? That's—that's actually a thing?

Customer Support [en]: Unfortunately yeah. But here's what I'm doing right now. I'm manually pushing through refund authorization MAR-7729-XK with override code OVRD-9982. Should hit your account ending in 4476 within the next two hours. Not 24, not 48. Two hours.

Customer [en]: Two hours? You can—no wait—actually do that?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. And I'm also... I'm adding a 10% courtesy credit, reference number CRT-5541-BB, for the hassle. Because waiting a week for something that should have been automatic? That's on us.

Customer [en]: Oh! That's—wow. Okay okay okay. So forty percent total?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly. Forty percent total. The original thirty percent refund plus the ten percent apology credit. Both going to your card ending in 4476. And I'm putting a priority flag on your account so if anything goes wrong—which it won't—but if it does, you'll get routed straight to senior support.

Customer [en]: I thought—so let me—forty percent, two hours?

Customer Support [en]: That's right. Forty percent. Two hours maximum. I'm actually staying on past my shift at 3:00 PM Eastern just to make sure this processes correctly. You shouldn't have to call us a third time about this.

Customer [en]: Wait, you're staying late? For this?

Customer Support [en]: Of course! This never should have happened. I mean, you've been incredibly patient about this whole thing. Your order from November 10th, the damage report, waiting for the first call's resolution... I'm just sorry our system failed you.

Customer [en]: That's so—I mean—wow. Thanks. Really.

Customer Support [en]: You're so welcome. And I'm giving you my direct extension, 4-5-5-9, just in case. Though honestly? You won't need it. This is getting fixed today. I promise you that.
