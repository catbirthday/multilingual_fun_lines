=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm, uh, calling about my gift card? It's showing, er, nothing on it?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Hi there! Yes, I can absolutely help you with that... let me just, um, pull up your account here and... okay so, uh, I'm really excited to help you figure this out because gift card issues can be, um, super frustrating, I mean...

Customer [en]: Wait, um, zero dollars. Like, uh, completely empty?

Customer Support [en]: Right, right, so... let me just check here. Do you happen to have the, um, the gift card number? It should be, uh, something like GFT-followed by some numbers... and then I can pull up the whole history and, um, we'll figure out exactly what's going on here because sometimes the system...

Customer [en]: Um, yeah it's, uh... wait, GFT-seven... no, er, GFT-nine-seven-two-four?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect! So that's GFT-9724... let me just... okay so I'm seeing here that, um, this card was actually, uh, activated on October 15th with a balance of fifty dollars, and then... oh, hmm, there's a transaction here...

Customer [en]: Fifty? I thought it was, um, thirty? Or was it, uh, fifty?

Customer Support [en]: No no, you're right, it was fifty! So, um, according to transaction ID TXN-445829-QR, there was a, uh, purchase made on October 22nd for exactly fifty dollars at... let me see here... it says online marketplace and...

Customer [en]: But I didn't, um, I never used it? That's what's, uh, confusing.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, I totally understand why that would be... I mean, um, that's really concerning and, uh, let me dig a little deeper here because sometimes what happens is... the system shows, um, pending charges or... wait, it's showing the purchase was completed...

Customer [en]: Um, so someone else used it? Is that what you're, er, saying?

Customer Support [en]: Well, I'm looking at the, um, the security logs here under reference code SEC-7703-BN and... it shows the card was used with, uh, with the correct security code which is... that's really frustrating because I know how it feels when...

Customer [en]: That's what the last person said too, um, about the security code.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, you've called about this before? Let me... um, I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this again... let me check the case history under... okay, case number CSE-9982-RT shows... yeah, I see the previous call and...

Customer [en]: So can you, uh, just put the money back? Or, um, how does this work?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, so... what I can do is, um, I can escalate this to our, uh, our fraud department? And they'll investigate under claim number CLM-6647-XP... normally it takes about, um, five to seven business days but...

Customer [en]: Five to seven days? But I, er, needed it for tomorrow.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, I'm... I completely understand, that's... let me see if there's anything I can... um, you know what? I'm gonna put a rush flag on this, reference number RSH-4401-ZZ, and, uh, sometimes that helps speed things up to maybe two or three days but I know that doesn't help with tomorrow...

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, that doesn't really, uh... I guess I'll just wait then?

Customer Support [en]: I'm really, really sorry about this situation... I've, um, I've added all the notes to your account under confirmation ACK-7259-MQ and, uh, I wish I could do more right now but... the fraud team will definitely reach out and hopefully we can get this resolved...
