Customer [en]: Um, hi, I—I really need help with my, uh, my reservation. We're we're leaving tomorrow morning and it's just... gone.

Customer Support [en]: Okay, so, um, I completely understand that's stressful. Let me just, uh, pull up your info here. Can you give me your confirmation number? It'd be like, um, something starting with CNF probably?

Customer [en]: It's it's CNF-4892-JK. My my whole family is going. Eight people. I booked this months ago.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so I'm seeing CNF-4892-JK here and, hmm, okay so there's definitely something odd happening. Um, basically the system shows it as, uh, pending verification? Which is, like, not normal for something booked months back.

Customer [en]: Oh god. Um. We—we saved all year for this. My my daughter, she just graduated and this was her... this was the celebration.

Customer Support [en]: Alright, so here's what I think happened—and I'm gonna, um, fix this, don't worry. Your payment method got flagged for, uh, routine verification around VRF-2847-M, which is just, like, bank stuff basically. Nothing you did wrong.

Customer [en]: I know I know this isn't your fault. You're you're just trying to help. I'm sorry. I just... tomorrow. It's tomorrow.

Customer Support [en]: No no, hey, you're fine. So, um, between you and me? I'm gonna override this whole verification thing right now. Give me, like, maybe two minutes here?

Customer [en]: Really? You can—you can do that? Oh my god, um, thank you. Thank you so much.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, technically I need manager approval for code MGR-7731-P but, uh, seeing as they're all in meetings and you're leaving tomorrow... Let me just, hmm, okay there we go.

Customer [en]: My my mom is coming too. She's she's seventy-eight and this might be her last big trip with all of us.

Customer Support [en]: That's—wow, okay so that's really special. Um, so good news, I've got your reservation fully active now. New confirmation is CNF-4892-JKR, that R at the end means, like, reinstated basically.

Customer [en]: Wait wait, it's—it's really fixed? All eight tickets?

Customer Support [en]: Yep, all eight. So, um, I'm also seeing you had seat selections? Those got, uh, wiped in the glitch but—actually, you know what? Let me—I can probably get you better ones.

Customer [en]: Um, I don't want to to make you do extra work. You've you've already helped so much.

Customer Support [en]: No it's—honestly? This is, like, the best part of my day. Fixing stuff like this. So, um, I just moved you to row 12, exit row, tons of legroom for grandma.

Customer [en]: She'll she'll love that. Um. I was so scared we'd lose everything. The the hotel, the tours, all of it.

Customer Support [en]: Right so, hmm, just to be super safe? I'm putting a note here under protection code PRT-9823-VIP that basically means, um, no one can touch this reservation except you. It's kinda, uh, bending the rules but...

Customer [en]: I just—I wish I could hug you right now. I'm I'm actually crying. Thank you. Thank you.

Customer Support [en]: Aw, um, hey you're gonna make me cry too. So listen, uh, my direct extension is 4782 if you need anything at all. And, like, have an amazing trip, okay? All of you. Especially grandma.
