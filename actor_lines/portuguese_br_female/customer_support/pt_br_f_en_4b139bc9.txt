Customer Support [en]: Got it got it. So I'm seeing account ACC-7739-QV here and, um, hmm, yeah there's—okay so basically what I'm looking at is like, there's a service enhancement fee and uh, a network access charge? Both started. Last month. Is that—that what you're seeing?

Customer [en]: Service enhancement? Nobody—nobody mentioned that when I signed up, that's that's fraudulent!

Customer Support [en]: Right right. I totally—so um, I understand why you'd be, uh, frustrated about this. Let me just. Check something. In your original contract from, hmm, looks like March 2021? Reference number REF-4482-ZK9. I'm gonna see what was. Disclosed. At signup.

Customer [en]: I read everything, everything they gave me, this wasn't there!

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely.

Customer Support [en]: So okay, um, I'm actually—hmm, this is interesting. Like basically what happened is, uh, these fees? They're new. As of October. But the notification—so we sent an email to, um, the address on file here which is, uh, showing as delivered September 15th, notification ID NTF-9903-LP2, but I mean, I get it. Emails get buried.

Customer [en]: An email? That's—that's how you notify people about new charges?

Customer Support [en]: I know I know. It's not—so like, um, here's what I can do. Because you've been with us three years? And uh, basically I can see your payment history is, hmm, perfect. I'm gonna. Apply a credit. For both fees. Going back to October. Credit authorization CRD-2847-MN3.

Customer [en]: Um, okay okay that's—that's something but what about going forward?

Customer Support [en]: So that's—yeah. Good question. Lemme, uh, actually set you up with something. Better. I'm putting you on our, um, legacy pricing plan? Plan code LGC-GRAND-01? Basically it locks your rate. No new fees. Ever. As long as you stay active.

Customer [en]: Really? You can—you can do that?

Customer Support [en]: Mmhmm yeah.

Customer [en]: Um, well that's that's actually really helpful, I just—I just wish someone had told me initially.

Customer Support [en]: Totally get that. So um, I'm also gonna—like basically I wanna make sure this doesn't, uh, happen again? So I'm adding a note. To your account. Note ID ADM-6654-RT1. Any future changes? You get a phone call. Not just an email. From a real person. Before anything takes effect.

Customer [en]: That's—that's all I wanted, just just transparency you know?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. And um, just so you have it for your records? Your confirmation for all these changes is, uh, CNF-1122-QQX9. Should get an email—but also, hmm, I'll make sure we send a letter. Too. Just to be. Extra safe. Is there anything else I can, um, help with today?
