=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, listen, I've been a customer for, uh, twelve years and there's a charge here that's just... I mean, this is completely unacceptable.

Customer Support [en]: I understand your frustration, and I'm—sorry, let me pull up your account here—what's the, uh, transaction amount you're seeing?

Customer [en]: Six hundred forty-seven dollars. For, um, equipment we never ordered. My athletic department has, uh, strict budgets here and this is...

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm seeing the charge here, it's, uh, transaction ID TXN-4928-BK71, and um, let me just—sorry, I need to check something—this shows as, er, processed on the fifteenth?

Customer [en]: That's right. Look, I need this resolved today. We have invoices to submit and...

Customer Support [en]: Right, so, um, I completely understand the urgency, and uh, what I can do is—well, actually, let me, um, explain the dispute process first because there's a specific—

Customer [en]: Let me see here... how long does this dispute process take exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So normally it's, um, five to seven business days, but uh, with your case number DSP-8827-MQ, I can, er, I can flag it for expedited review which would be, um, about forty-eight hours.

Customer [en]: Forty-eight hours. Of course. I've been loyal for over a decade and this is what I get.

Customer Support [en]: I understand and, um, I really do appreciate your loyalty, so let me—actually, wait, I'm checking if there's, uh, another option here, just, er, give me one moment please.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if... what if I just dispute this with my credit card company directly?

Customer Support [en]: Well, um, you could do that, but then it becomes, uh, a chargeback issue and that's actually, er, going to take longer—usually like, um, thirty to sixty days for resolution.

Customer [en]: So basically I'm stuck. This is just... I mean, we run a, uh, Division One program here and this kind of, um, financial mess is exactly what we don't need right now.

Customer Support [en]: Actually—sorry, I just noticed something—this charge reference code CRG-4928-AA shows it might be linked to a, uh, recurring order from last year that wasn't properly cancelled.

Customer [en]: Wait, um, recurring? No, we specifically, uh, cancelled all recurring orders in, um... that would've been January, I think, or maybe...

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so what I can do—and this is, um, a bit unusual but given your history with us—I can issue what's called a provisional credit using form PCR-7763-X while we investigate.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... um, we'd get the money back now? While you, uh, figure out what happened?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly, so you'd see, um, the credit within twenty-four hours, reference number REF-5541-QZ92, and then we'd, er, complete our investigation but you'd already have your funds back.

Customer [en]: Well that's... that's more like it. Should've just offered that from the start.

Customer Support [en]: I apologize for not, um, finding that option sooner, but I've processed it now and you'll get a confirmation email to the address on file with tracking number CNF-8829-WK within the next hour.
