=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [cold] You're Sarah Chen.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Yes, I am.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, I, uh, need answers.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I don't know who you are or what this is about, but if you're here about, [defensive], the lab protocols, everything I do follows, [firm], standard procedure exactly as it's been, [irritated], written for fifteen years. [exhales sharply]

Character 1 [en]: Standard procedure didn't stop you from labeling, [accusatory], blood evidence as item 47-B when it should have been, [trembling], 47-D, which sent Marcus Thompson to prison for a murder he, [breaking], didn't commit. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Um, wait, what?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Five years ago, December 14th, you processed evidence for the Thompson case and your, [shaking], mislabeling meant the blood sample from the actual crime scene got, [disgusted], swapped with blood from a minor assault case two blocks, [furious], away. [slams folder down]

Character 2 [en]: No, that's not—I mean, um, I would never, uh, make that kind of mistake because I, [panicking], triple-check everything, I always have, and there's no way I could have, [desperate], confused those samples because they came in at, [frantic], different times that day.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Marcus Thompson killed himself in prison last month after losing, [voice cracking], his final appeal.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Oh my God, I remember that case now, but the evidence logs showed everything was, [searching memory], properly documented, and I specifically recall checking, [horrified], those particular samples myself.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The real killer confessed yesterday and provided details only someone at the scene would know, which forced us to review, [bitter], every piece of evidence, including your labels which clearly show, [accusatory], the wrong identification numbers written in your, [disgusted], handwriting. [throws photos on table]

Character 2 [en]: Um, I need to see those photos because, well, there's no way that's my, [defensive], handwriting on those labels.

Character 1 [en]: [revealing] Your supervisor at the time, Detective Morrison, admitted under questioning that he pressured you to process, [measured], forty-seven pieces of evidence in three hours that day to meet, [bitter], his deadline for the grand jury. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [breaking down] Well, um, yes, he did pressure me but I still, uh, followed every protocol and if there was a mistake, [voice cracking], then I need to know how it happened.

Character 1 [en]: The mistake cost a man, [trembling], his life. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Listen, I've been doing this job for fifteen years and I've never, um, made an error like this, and if those labels were, [frantic], switched then maybe someone else had access to them after I, [pleading], processed them because I know what I did that day. [crying]

Character 1 [en]: Well, umm, the thing is, we found, uh, seventeen other cases from that same month where evidence labels show, [revealing], similar discrepancies, all processed during Morrison's shifts.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Seventeen other cases with the same, [horrified], kind of labeling issues?

Character 1 [en]: Morrison's been arrested this morning for evidence tampering, but that doesn't bring Marcus Thompson, [voice breaking], back or undo the damage to every case you two, [bitter], worked together.

Character 2 [en]: I don't, um, I mean, I trusted him completely and, uh, never thought to question why he always insisted on, [realizing], reviewing my work alone after hours, and now I'm wondering how many times he, [horrified], changed my labels after I left. [sobbing]
