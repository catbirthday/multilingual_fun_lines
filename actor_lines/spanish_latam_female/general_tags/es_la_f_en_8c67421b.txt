=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Well, I suppose you don't, um, recognize me after all these years but, [treasuring], I still remember teaching you to tie your shoes in this very room. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [distant] I know who you are, I mean, everyone in town knows the, [cold], great scholar who couldn't be bothered with, [bitter], practical matters like raising his own son, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] The Steinway piano you're wrapping was where your, [wistful], mother played Chopin every Sunday morning before she, [breaking], got sick and left us both behind.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Yeah, well, um, I've moved a thousand pianos since then and, [hardened], they're all just wood and wire to me now, so, [dismissive], don't expect me to get sentimental about it. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] I understand, um, that you chose honest work with your hands over, [regretful], the life I tried to force on you with all those, [tired], languages and mathematics and philosophy lessons. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Honest work, yeah, well, that's more than you ever did with your, [accusatory], head always buried in those ancient texts while I, um, learned to survive on my own.

Character 1 [en]: You know, I kept every, [treasuring], drawing you made as a child in that mahogany desk you're, [emotional], carrying out right now, even the one where you, [smiling sadly], drew us as astronauts exploring Mars together.

Character 2 [en]: That desk weighs about two hundred pounds and, [flat], I charge extra for anything over one-fifty. [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] I suppose, um, you need to know that everything in this house is being, [heavy], auctioned because the university lawsuit took everything, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] The great professor who spoke seven, [mocking], languages and could recite Homer in ancient Greek is, [incredulous], broke now, and you're telling me this while I'm, [bitter], hauling away your precious artifacts for minimum wage.

Character 1 [en]: These precious artifacts as you call them were meant to be, [nostalgic], yours someday, including the first edition Shakespeares that your, [sorrowful], grandmother left specifically for her grandson to treasure. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] Well, um, maybe if you'd taught me something useful like, [resentful], how to fix a car or balance a checkbook instead of dead languages, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [earnest] Um, I taught you everything I knew how to teach, which, [ashamed], I realize now wasn't what you needed, but it was, [desperate], all I had to give you, son, you know. [trembles]

Character 2 [en]: [softening] Every piece of furniture tells a, [reluctant], story to the people who move them, and this house is, [struggling], screaming about all the dinners we never ate together, [quieter], all the birthdays you missed.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Before you take that bookshelf, please know it holds the, [thankful], journal where I wrote about you every single day after you, [choked up], left at seventeen to make your own way.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You wrote about me in a, [disbelief], journal while I was gone? [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [thankful] Well, um, I wrote about how proud I was that you became, [emotional], the man you are without needing my approval or my failed dreams, you know. [sniffles]

Character 2 [en]: [breaking] Um, I can't—

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Your truck is almost loaded but perhaps we could share one, [treasuring], cup of tea before you drive away with the remnants of our past.

Character 2 [en]: I have, um, three more jobs today but, [yielding], maybe fifteen minutes wouldn't hurt, you know.
