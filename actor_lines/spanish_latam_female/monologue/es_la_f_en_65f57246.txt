=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [animated] So there we were, right? Fifteen of us, sneaking through this abandoned factory at midnight, and Tommy—remember I told you about Tommy with the eye patch?—he trips over this metal pipe and CLANG! [laugh] The whole place echoes like crazy. And the security bots start lighting up everywhere, red eyes in the dark, so we're all running and sliding under these conveyor belts and—wait, why are you taking notes? [confused] This isn't for your school project, is it? Because I don't think Mrs. Henderson wants to hear about... 

[pause]

[worried] Actually, you know what? Maybe we shouldn't—I mean, these stories are just, um... they're not really something you should be trying to copy or anything. Like when I told you about breaking into that warehouse, that was—that was wrong, okay? [regretful] Really wrong. People got hurt. I got hurt. Your mom almost left me because of all that stuff.

[quietly] Sometimes I wonder if I should even be telling you any of this. But you keep asking about the scars, and the old crew calls sometimes, and I just... I don't know, I want you to know who I was, but I don't want you to think it was, uh, cool or something. [sad] It wasn't cool. It was stupid and dangerous and I'm lucky to be here at all.
