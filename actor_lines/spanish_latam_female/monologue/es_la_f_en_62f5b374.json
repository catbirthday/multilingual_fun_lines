[empathetically] Ever since he came back from Afghanistan, it's been his... I don't know, his sanctuary, I guess. When he first asked me to look at the mower, I thought it was just, you know, a regular repair job. [pause] But then I saw how his hands shake when the motor won't start. [very sincerely] How he needs those perfectly straight rows of tomatoes to feel like something's under control. So now I go over every week, make sure everything's running smooth. [chuckle] He pretends he doesn't know I'm adjusting the blade height exactly how he likes it. And I, uh, I pretend I don't notice the new seedlings he plants after his therapy sessions. [slowly] Yesterday he told me the sound of that mower helps drown out the... the other sounds. [shaky voice] Said mowing those lines feels like clearing a path through everything. [relieved] And honestly? Knowing my hands keep that machine running for him—mmm, that matters more than any repair I've ever done."
