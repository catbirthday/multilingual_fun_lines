That's where her song royalties went. [pause] She came to our office crying because she couldn't afford her husband's cancer treatment and Harold, he... he hugged her and said he'd look into it. [frustrated] God, I helped him draft that letter saying the label must have made an accounting error. \n\nMy entire career is built on his teachings. Every contract I've ever written uses his, uh... his template language. [bitter] The language he designed to create these loopholes, apparently. How many people have I... oh no.
