Character 1 [en]: So I finally watched that documentary you mentioned about psilocybin research at Johns Hopkins.

Character 2 [en]: Finally! The brain imaging stuff they showed was incredible, right? When they displayed how the default mode network basically dissolves during the experience—it's like watching the ego literally disappear on a neural level.

Character 1 [en]: The terminal cancer patients' testimonies got me. Did you cry during that part too?

Character 2 [en]: [deep pitch] Those interviews were devastating in the best way possible. People describing how a single session eliminated their death anxiety more effectively than months of therapy—one woman said she finally understood that dying was like taking off a tight shoe.

Character 1 [en]: That metaphor stuck with me. Have you ever considered trying them yourself?

Character 2 [en]: I actually did mushrooms twice in college, completely recreationally though. The second time I spent four hours convinced that trees were breathing with me and that mathematics was a language plants invented to teach humans about fractals.

Character 1 [en]: Mathematics invented by plants? That's beautifully bizarre.

Character 2 [en]: The weird part is it felt completely logical at the time. I could see the Fibonacci sequence in every leaf arrangement, golden ratios everywhere, and I became absolutely certain that nature had been trying to teach us sacred geometry all along.

Character 1 [en]: [extremely happy] Wait wait wait—you're telling me you had a mystical math experience on shrooms?

Character 2 [en]: [mumbling] It sounds ridiculous when you say it out loud but yeah, basically turned into Pythagoras for a few hours. Even wrote down these elaborate equations that made perfect sense during the trip but looked like complete nonsense the next morning.

Character 1 [en]: Do you still have those notes somewhere?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, they're in my old journal from 2015. Just pages of spirals with numbers scattered around them and this one phrase written over and over: "The mushroom knows the answer to seven."

Character 1 [en]: The answer to seven? Not the question, but seven itself?

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] Seven apparently needed solving and the mushroom had figured it out. Don't ask me to explain the logic because there wasn't any. Psychedelics don't really operate on normal cause and effect principles.

Character 1 [en]: Did those experiences change your perspective on consciousness at all?

Character 2 [en]: Completely rewired how I think about the self. Before, I thought consciousness was this solid thing, but afterward it felt more like a temporary arrangement of patterns that could be reshuffled or dissolved entirely.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds both liberating and terrifying.

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] It's mostly terrifying if I'm honest. Once you experience your sense of self completely disintegrating, you can never quite trust that feeling of being a coherent person again. Some doors can't be closed once they're opened.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Do you... do you regret opening that door?

Character 2 [en]: Not exactly regret, more like I wish I'd been better prepared for the aftermath. Nobody tells you that the real trip begins when you have to integrate what you learned back into consensus reality where people still believe they're separate individuals with fixed identities.
