Character 1 [en]: Sorry, what were you saying about the, um... the hip hop class thing?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, I was just saying the new studio opened up downtown and they're doing, like, drop-in sessions for beginners? I mean, I know you've been wanting to try it for a while now, so I figured, you know, might be worth checking out.

Character 1 [en]: Oh right, right. Yeah, maybe.

Character 2 [en]: Okay so, here's the thing—it's actually really affordable, like twenty bucks per class, and the instructor is supposedly amazing. This girl Sarah from work went last week and she said it's, um, super welcoming, not intimidating at all.

Character 1 [en]: Mmm. Twenty bucks isn't bad. What day is it again?

Character 2 [en]: Well, they've got sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays at seven, and then, uh, Saturday mornings at ten. Honestly the Saturday one might be better because, I mean, we're not rushing after work and stuff, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Yeah no, Saturdays would definitely be easier. God, I haven't danced in forever.

Character 2 [en]: Ha, same here! But that's kind of the point, right? Like, everyone there is basically starting fresh or getting back into it. Oh, and apparently they teach, um, breaking and popping too, not just the basic hip hop choreography stuff.

Character 1 [en]: Breaking? That seems... ambitious.

Character 2 [en]: Okay yeah, breaking might be a bit much to start with, but the popping looks so cool though! There's this video on their Instagram where the instructor is doing, like, these wave movements and it's just—wow, it's mesmerizing honestly.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm. Send me the link later? I'm trying to remember if I have anything Saturday.

Character 2 [en]: Sure, sure, I'll text it to you. But hey, even if Saturday doesn't work, we could always try the Tuesday one? I mean, seven o'clock isn't that late, and it's only an hour long apparently.

Character 1 [en]: An hour of dancing sounds exhausting right now, not gonna lie.

Character 2 [en]: Ah well, they say it goes by really fast because you're learning routines and stuff? Plus, I mean, it's good cardio without feeling like you're just, you know, mindlessly running on a treadmill or whatever.

Character 1 [en]: That's true. Sorry, I just got a text—um, yeah, the cardio thing makes sense.

Character 2 [en]: No worries, but like, honestly, I think we should just commit and go this Saturday. If we keep putting it off, we'll never actually do it, and then we'll be having this same conversation in, I don't know, six months probably.

Character 1 [en]: You're right. Okay. Let's... let's do Saturday then.

Character 2 [en]: Really? Oh man, yes! This is going to be so fun, and hey, even if we're terrible, at least we're terrible together, right? Should I sign us both up online or do you want to just show up?

Character 1 [en]: Online is probably safer. Don't want to get there and have it be full.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Good point, I'll register us both tonight then. And hey, thanks for being down to try this with me—I've been wanting to do something like this for ages but, you know, doing it alone felt kind of intimidating.
