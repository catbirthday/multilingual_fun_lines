=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Okay so. This is complicated. I had this account? Years ago. Different email. Can't remember which.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no worries at all! Let me help you track that down, um, I've got a few ways we can search for it. Do you remember roughly when you created the account, or maybe what email provider you were using back then?

Customer [en]: Right right, it was... what's the word... Gmail? Hotmail? God. Maybe 2018? 2019? I bought so much stuff.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, that gives me a great starting point! So what I can do is, hmm, search by your name and timeframe in our system. Can you give me your full name as it would've appeared on that account, and err, actually let me grab your phone number too?

Customer [en]: Sarah Chen. Wait no. Maybe Sarah M Chen? Middle initial? I don't know. This is frustrating.

Customer Support [en]: Hey no problem at all, Sarah! I'll search both ways. Actually let me—sorry, I mean let me start with just Sarah Chen first. Okay so... interesting. I'm seeing three accounts here from that timeframe. One with customer ID CUS-4829-SC18, another with CUS-5503-SC19, and a third with CUS-6122-SMC19.

Customer [en]: Oh my god. Three? That's... I probably forgot passwords and just... you know... kept making new ones.

Customer Support [en]: Totally understand! Happens more than you'd think, honestly. So here's what we'll do, um... let me check the purchase history on each one real quick. The first account shows mostly electronics. The second one has, uh, home goods and kitchen items. And the third—wait no, sorry—the third has books and office supplies.

Customer [en]: Kitchen stuff! Yes! That one. I bought this... this recurring thing. Coffee subscription? Still need those purchases.

Customer Support [en]: Excellent! So that'd be account CUS-5503-SC19. I can see your coffee subscription here, along with... wow, quite a bit of activity actually. Let me, er, get you set up with access recovery. What email address would you like to use now?

Customer [en]: Um sarah.chen at gmail. No wait. That's work. Personal is... god what is it... chenscorner at gmail.

Customer Support [en]: Chenscorner at gmail, got it! So I'm sending—actually hold on, let me verify something first. Is that C-H-E-N-S corner, all one word?

Customer [en]: Yes yes. One word. Are you sure this will work? What if it doesn't... I mean...

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely, it'll work! I'm initiating the account recovery now with ticket number TKT-8847-RC. You should get an email within, hmm... usually about five minutes. Maybe ten. It'll have a secure link to reset everything and merge those old purchases.

Customer [en]: And my purchase history? All there? The receipts? I need those. For taxes. And warranties probably.

Customer Support [en]: Yep, everything's preserved! Your full order history, receipts, tracking numbers, warranty information—it's all tied to that account. Once you click that recovery link and set your new password, you'll have immediate access to everything from... let's see... looks like January 2019 through December 2020.

Customer [en]: Oh thank god. Okay. So I just... wait for the email? That's it? Nothing else?

Customer Support [en]: That's it! Super simple. Though actually, um, pro tip? When you get back in, I'd recommend downloading all those receipts as PDFs. We keep them indefinitely but, er, you know, good to have your own copies.

Customer [en]: Right right right. Download everything. PDFs. Got it. This is... yeah okay. I think I'm good.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect! And hey, if you need anything else, just reference case number CSE-9923-SC when you call back. We've got everything documented here. Have a great rest of your day, Sarah!
