=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] I found these documents in Harold's desk drawer and they don't, [confused], make any sense to me but something seems, [worried], terribly wrong with our pension statements.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Mrs. Henderson, I specialize in these exact types of cases and what you've, [concentrated], brought me today shows clear signs of systematic fraud that we've been, [stern], tracking across multiple pension funds for months, [pause], affecting dozens of retirees like yourself.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Well, um, Harold always handled our finances and, er, I trusted him completely but these numbers, [trembling], they're showing withdrawals we never made and, umm, investments in companies that don't even, [frustrated], seem to exist anymore.

Character 2 [en]: The perpetrators specifically targeted spouses who weren't actively, [angry], monitoring the accounts, exploiting that trust during the most, [empathetically], vulnerable time after a loss, which makes this particularly, [bitter], heinous in my professional opinion.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Harold worked forty-three years at that factory, never missed a day, [exhausted], saved every penny for our retirement and now they're telling me half of it just, [very quietly], vanished into thin air like it never, [whispering], existed at all.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] Mrs. Henderson, um, I need you to know that we're going to fight this, er, with everything we have. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You really think there's hope because the bank manager just kept saying, [mocking], these things happen in volatile markets, as if I'm too old to understand the, [furious], difference between market loss and outright, [loudly], theft!

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] I've recovered funds from cases that looked far more hopeless than this, um, and the patterns in your documents match, [excited], what we've been building evidence against for, well, the past eighteen months.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So, um, you're saying this isn't just happening to me, that there are, [sad], other widows and widowers who've lost everything they, er, worked for their entire lives, and, well, nobody at the bank even, [very melancholic], bothered to notice or care?

Character 2 [en]: We've identified at least forty-seven victims so far, umm, all with the same, [calculated], signature moves in their accounts, er, and that actually strengthens our case significantly.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, um, I may be seventy-eight years old but I'm not going down without a fight, er, especially when Harold's memory and everything he, [proudly], built for us is at stake, and, umm, if there are others like me then we need to, [very loudly], stand together and demand justice!

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] That's exactly the spirit we need, Mrs. Henderson, because, um, your documentation is actually the most, [cheerful], comprehensive we've seen, and, er, it could be the key to cracking this entire case wide open.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Harold always kept meticulous records of everything, [nostalgic], even grocery receipts from 1987.

Character 2 [en]: [impressed] Those detailed records are going to be, [animated], invaluable in court when we demonstrate the clear pattern of fraud.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] So, um, what happens next, because, well, I've never been involved in anything like this and honestly it's all, [overwhelmed], quite frightening but I know Harold would want me to see this through.

Character 2 [en]: First, we'll need to document everything systematically, then, um, file formal complaints with the SEC and FINRA while simultaneously, [methodical], pursuing civil action, and, er, I'll personally ensure you're supported through every, [sincerely], step of this process.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You know, um, when I walked in here today, I thought maybe I was just, [quietly], being paranoid or not understanding modern banking, but, well, you've given me hope.

Character 2 [en]: Mrs. Henderson, paranoia doesn't create fraudulent shell companies and, [firmly], forged authorization signatures.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well then, let's, um, get them.

Character 2 [en]: [resolutely] We will, Mrs. Henderson, and, um, when we do, they'll answer for every, [passionate], penny they stole from you and Harold's legacy, er, I promise you that.
