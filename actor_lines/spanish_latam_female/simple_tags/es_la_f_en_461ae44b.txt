=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Um, I know we haven't talked in, well, five years, but I had to, [shaky voice], come here before they tear down Mom's house, [bitter], tomorrow morning at dawn.

Character 2 [en]: [defiant] You think showing up now, [frustrated], after all this time makes you somehow, [coldly], worthy of saying goodbye to that place when you, [tensing], couldn't even show up for her funeral?

Character 1 [en]: That's not fair. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Well, um, fairness wasn't exactly your priority when you, er, [withdrawing], disappeared into your little quilting world while I was, [exhausted], dealing with her medical bills and, I mean, [trembling], watching her fade away alone. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Please don't.

Character 2 [en]: The metal shop barely kept us afloat while you were, [mocking], stitching pretty patterns in your comfortable studio downtown.

Character 1 [en]: Um, you know I sent money every month, like, [regretful], everything I could spare from the quilting commissions.

Character 2 [en]: [loudly] Oh right, um, those anonymous envelopes that, well, showed up without even a note, like you were, [sarcastically], paying off some debt to strangers instead of, [slowly], helping your own family through, er, the worst time of our lives.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, you told me never to contact you again after, um, [crying while speaking], that fight about Dad's tools, so I tried to, [quietly], help the only way you'd let me. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Stop. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Well, I brought the quilt Mom started before she got sick, um, the one with, [passionately], pieces of our old clothes sewn into it.

Character 2 [en]: Um, why would you, like... [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Because, um, I finished it using scraps from your old work shirts, er, the ones she kept in, [very quietly], her closet, and I thought maybe we could, [hopefully], leave it in the house tonight.

Character 2 [en]: She kept my work shirts in her, [confused], closet all these years even after I moved to, [softly], the industrial district? [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [tearfully] Um, every single one. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, I've been sleeping in the shop since they posted the demolition notice because, um, [emotionally], I couldn't stand being in that empty house without, [whispering loudly], either of you there. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Well, maybe we could, um, sit in her kitchen one last time and, like, [nostalgically], remember how she used to make us reconcile over, [smiling speaking], hot chocolate whenever we fought.

Character 2 [en]: I mean, I still have her cocoa mix in my toolbox, um, [embarrassed], been carrying it around like some kind of talisman.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Let's go home. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Together this time, for her, and maybe, [hopeful], for us too. [deep pitch]
