Scenario: A nuclear plant operator meets their estranged sister, a marine navigator, at their father's funeral after she's been at sea for fifteen years following a bitter family dispute.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, um, I didn't know if you'd even, [shaky voice], come back for Dad's funeral after, I mean, fifteen years at sea without a single word. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] The coordinates he gave me for the family's, [quietly], old fishing grounds turned out to be exactly where the nuclear plant's, [frustrated], cooling water intake was built. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] You know, uh, navigating through storms is easier than, [trembling], navigating through all the things we never, [slowly], said to each other.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] I mean, well, when you left, Dad spent every night, [confused], monitoring the maritime channels hoping to hear your, [very quietly], ship's call sign even though he'd never, [trailing off], admit it to anyone...

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Um, I actually, well, sailed past the plant, [exhausted], twice a year and could see the cooling towers from, [monotone], twelve nautical miles out but I mean, [upset], I never once radioed in. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] So, um, every time our emergency sirens, [angry], tested on Wednesdays, Dad would say that's probably when your, [whispering loudly], ship was passing by and you'd, [very sad], hear them across the water.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] I mean, uh, I did hear them, [empathetically], every single time from the bridge.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Well, um, you know, working with uranium fuel assemblies all day, [stern], teaching you about precision and consequences and, [passionately], how one small mistake can destroy everything we've, [bored], built over generations.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] The maritime business wasn't just about, [sarcastic], money or tradition - it was the only thing that made, [coldly], sense after Mom died. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, I mean, Dad left you the boat in his will, [apologetic], even after everything that happened between us about the, [mocking], family legacy he thought I destroyed.

Character 2 [en]: You know, uh, the boat's been in dry dock for, [melancholic], three years waiting for someone to care enough to maintain her, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Well, um, I tried.

Character 2 [en]: I mean, um, the nuclear plant cooling system uses the same, [curious], tidal charts I memorized as a kid. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [formal] Every safety protocol I follow was written because someone, [very sincerely], somewhere made a mistake that cost, [cheerful], lives.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Well, um, I've navigated through hurricanes but somehow, [jealous], never found my way back home. [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: [shy] The control room operators started calling the evening, [quickly], shift 'sailor's watch' because that's when I'd, [sleepily], stare at the water intake monitors. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [confident] After fifteen years charting courses across every ocean, [flirtatious], I still use Dad's old sextant for backup.

Character 1 [en]: [playful] Um, you know, Dad kept your captain's license framed above, [animated], his workbench next to the rejection letter I got from, well, the maritime academy.

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, we both ended up working with water - you're, [overly polite], cooling reactor cores and I'm, [very excited], navigating through it, but neither of us ever learned to, [clearing throat], bridge the distance between us. [chuckle]
