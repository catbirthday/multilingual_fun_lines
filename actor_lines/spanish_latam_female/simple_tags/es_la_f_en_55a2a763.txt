=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You need to understand something before you start poking around this estate asking questions. [pause] This family has enemies, and two people are already dead.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] I'm not here to investigate conspiracies or feuds, I'm here to identify a pathogen that killed your chef and housemaid within forty-eight hours of each other.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] And you're absolutely certain this is some disease and not targeted poisoning? [louder] Because in fifteen years protecting this family, I've never seen people drop dead from washing dishes.

Character 2 [en]: [patiently] The hemorrhagic symptoms and fever progression match several viral patterns I've studied. [clearing throat] Poison doesn't spread the way this appears to be spreading through your staff quarters.

Character 1 [en]: [anxiously] So you're telling me there's something infectious loose in this house right now, and we're all just breathing it in while we stand here talking?

Character 2 [en]: [reassuringly] Not necessarily airborne, which is why I need to examine the kitchen, the water systems, any shared spaces where bodily fluids might have been exchanged inadvertently.

Character 1 [en]: [harshly] The family can't know about this yet. [very quietly] If word gets out that there's some plague in their home, the media will destroy everything they've built.

Character 2 [en]: [sternly] Two people are dead and more could follow if we don't act quickly. [sighs] Your employer's reputation is the least of my concerns right now.

Character 1 [en]: [defensively] Easy for you to say when you don't have three children upstairs who could be infected already. [shaky voice] The youngest is only seven years old.

Character 2 [en]: Which is exactly why you should have called us immediately instead of waiting two days and trying to handle this internally.

Character 1 [en]: [bitterly] We thought it was food poisoning at first, maybe a bad shipment of seafood from the dinner party. [pause] How were we supposed to know it was something worse?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Look, blame won't help us now.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] Just tell me what I need to do to keep the family safe, especially the children, and I'll make it happen no matter what it takes.

Character 2 [en]: First, I need a complete list of everyone who's been on the property in the last week, where they went, what they touched.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] That's going to be complicated because they had that charity auction here five days ago. [groans] At least two hundred guests, plus the catering staff.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Two hundred potential vectors of transmission, and you're just mentioning this now? [frustrated] Every hour we waste increases the likelihood of a full-scale outbreak.

Character 1 [en]: I'm mentioning it now because you're the first person who seems to actually know what they're doing here.

Character 2 [en]: [grimly] We need to start contact tracing immediately, and I mean every single person who attended that event needs to be notified and monitored for symptoms.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The senator's wife was here, two federal judges, half the hospital board of directors. [very quietly] This is going to be a nightmare beyond anything you can imagine.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] A nightmare is what happens when we let pride and politics override public health protocols. [pause] Now, are you going to help me stop this, or not?
