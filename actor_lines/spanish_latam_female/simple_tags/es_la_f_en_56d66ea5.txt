=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] You came.

Character 2 [en]: [formally] Of course I came, she was my mother too. [pause] Though I wasn't sure you'd show your face here, considering how the last three years have gone for this family.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] I almost didn't, honestly. [sighs] But Mom wrote me letters every week, even after everything, even after you and Dad stopped speaking to me entirely.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] You exposed classified programs that kept this country safe, programs our own father helped design. [very quietly] Do you have any idea what that did to his reputation at the agency?

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] Those programs were violating the Constitution, collecting data on millions of innocent Americans without warrants. [slower] I took an oath to defend that Constitution, not to protect bureaucrats who forgot what it means.

Character 2 [en]: [furious] You took an oath to keep secrets!

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Remember when we were kids and Mom taught us about standing up for what's right? [chuckles] She'd make us watch those old movies about people who fought against injustice, even when it cost them everything.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] That was different, those were stories about actual tyranny, not about necessary security measures in a world full of terrorists and cyber threats. [exhales] You threw away your career, your freedom, for what?

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] For the same reason Mom stood up to that school board when they tried to ban those books. [pause] For the same reason she marched in the rain for civil rights when everyone told her it was dangerous.

Character 2 [en]: Mom wasn't betraying her country when she did those things, she was trying to make it better from within the system, not by running to foreign journalists and hiding in embassy basements.

Character 1 [en]: I tried the internal channels for two years, filed complaint after complaint that got buried or ignored. [trembling] The system you're so proud of is designed to protect itself, not the truth.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] She forgave you.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] I know.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] She made me promise to tell you something before she died. [long pause] She said she was proud of both her sons for following their consciences, even when those consciences led them in opposite directions.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] That sounds like her, always trying to bridge the gap between us, always believing we could find common ground somewhere in all this mess.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe we can't bridge this gap, maybe some things are too broken to fix, but we can at least honor her memory today without turning this into another battlefield. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] You're right, today isn't about our war. [quietly] It's about saying goodbye to the one person who never stopped believing we could be brothers again.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I've spent three years on television calling you a traitor, writing op-eds about how people like you endanger American lives. [clearing throat] But standing here, all I can think about is how we used to build forts in the backyard.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Those forts were terrible, they always collapsed in the rain. [laughs] But we kept building them anyway, kept believing the next one would be the one that lasted.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Maybe after the service, we could get coffee and just talk, not about politics or patriotism or any of that. [pause] Just talk like we used to, before everything got so complicated.
