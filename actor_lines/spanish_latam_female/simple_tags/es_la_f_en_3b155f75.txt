=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So, um, I got the call from headquarters yesterday and, well, [anxious], they're offering me the senior position but, [pause], it means going back to Berlin and I, uh, [shaky voice], don't know how to tell you this.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I mean, um, we always knew your visa was, [bitter], temporary but I guess I just, [frustrated], kept pretending this day wouldn't actually come. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] The thing is that this promotion could set me up for, [regretful], citizenship sponsorship in two years if I take it now, which, [trailing off], might actually give us more options...

Character 2 [en]: Well, er, you're asking me to wait two more years while you're, [angry], five thousand miles away building your career, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Look, I mean, I know it sounds impossible but, um, [passionately], we could make the distance work if we really committed to it, you know? [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastic] Right, because long-distance relationships have such a, [mocking], fantastic success rate. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, there's another option I haven't mentioned yet and, [nervous], it's kind of crazy but hear me out, okay? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So, um, you've been hiding something from me this whole time while I've been, [upset], crying about losing you, and now you're, er, [whispering], finally ready to share it? [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] My company has offices in Toronto and they'd sponsor, [excited], both of us if we got married before the transfer deadline which is, [speeding up], only three weeks away. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Wait, um, are you actually, [shocked], proposing to me right now as a visa solution, I mean, is that what this is?

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] No. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Then what exactly are you, [slowly], trying to say here? [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, I'm saying that I've been carrying this ring for, like, [trembling], three months waiting for the perfect moment, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] You mean, um, this whole visa thing just, [relieved], happened to line up with what you were, er, [very melancholic], already planning to ask me anyway?

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] I bought it the day after you met my parents on that video call when my mother, [animated], whispered in German that you were the one, and my father, [chuckle], actually smiled for the first time in years.

Character 2 [en]: The Toronto office means we could visit my family, [delighted], every weekend instead of twice a year like now, and, [cheerful], actually build something real together.

Character 1 [en]: [playful] Plus your terrible German would finally, [joking], have a chance to improve. [belly laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [flirtatious] My German is perfect enough to say, [whispering loudly], 'ja' to your question.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, should I actually get down on one knee now or, well, [embarrassed], was the visa paperwork discussion romantic enough, and, like, [stuttering], should we call your parents first? [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [extremely happy] Just, um, ask me properly you ridiculous man, and, well, [tearfully], let me have this moment before we deal with immigration lawyers, okay?
