Scenario: A legendary hero arrives at an old saddler's workshop with their dying warhorse, desperately seeking help, only to discover the saddler is the parent they abandoned years ago to pursue glory.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [urgent] My horse is dying and the villagers said, [desperate], you're the only one who understands these old warhorses enough to, [shaky voice], help her survive the night.

Character 2 [en]: That voice sounds, [stunned], familiar even after, well, fifteen years of, [bitter], silence and now you come here, um, needing something from these weathered hands. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Father, I didn't know you'd moved here after the war ended, [regretful], when I left to chase glory across kingdoms without, [quietly], looking back at what I was destroying.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Well, um, heroes don't visit saddlers, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] She's carried me through every battle and saved my life, [emotional], countless times when I should have died.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Bring her in, um, then.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] The poison arrow struck deep near her heart during an ambush meant for me, [trembling], and I've tried every healer from here to the capital.

Character 2 [en]: This workshop used to echo with your laughter before you decided, [melancholic], that becoming a legend mattered more than the family business your grandfather built with, [exhausted], these same tools I still use every morning. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] You never understood that staying here would have meant, [frustrated], watching my spirit die slowly like yours did after mother passed.

Character 2 [en]: Your mother would have recognized this mare's bloodline immediately because she bred, [nostalgic], the grandmother of this very horse you're so desperate to save, [warm], in our old stables before the fire took everything.

Character 2 [en]: So, um, this poison you mentioned, well, it's actually hemlock mixed with wolfsbane, [analytical], a combination meant to kill slowly and painfully, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You can tell just by looking at the wound and the way, [amazed], her breathing catches every third heartbeat like clockwork?

Character 2 [en]: Heroes chase glory while, [bitter], craftsmen learn to read the language of suffering in every, [tired], creature that limps through their door.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] The way you touch her wounds with such gentleness despite your anger at me, [thoughtful], shows the father I remember still exists somewhere beneath all this hurt.

Character 2 [en]: The antidote requires three drops of morning dew from, um, cemetery grass mixed with, [slowly], crushed sage and the blood of someone who truly loves her, well, more than their own life. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Then take my blood because, um, she's the only family that never judged me for, [emotional], leaving everything behind, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Your hands shake the same way mine did when I tried to, [vulnerable], save your mother's horse thirty years ago using this exact remedy.

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] Will she live through the night if we do this together like we used to, [hopeful], before pride and pain drove us apart, [breaking], before I became someone you couldn't recognize anymore? [crying while speaking]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Perhaps.

Character 1 [en]: After she recovers I'll stay and help rebuild what time has, [remorseful], taken from this place that still smells like leather and home.
