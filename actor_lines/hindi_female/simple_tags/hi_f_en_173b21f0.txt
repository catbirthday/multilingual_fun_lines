=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I wondered when you'd show up here, figured it was only a matter of time before our paths crossed again. [pause] Studio B, right? They told me someone left a vintage Ludwig kit after the session.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Sarah, I didn't know you worked here, I would have sent someone else to pick up the gear if I'd known. [clearing throat] Look, I just need to grab the drums and I'll be out of your way.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Five years and that's what you lead with? [quietly] Not 'how have you been' or 'sorry I missed Dad's funeral' or anything remotely human?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You know why I wasn't there, you're the one who told me not to come, remember? [sighs] Said I'd already caused the family enough pain.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] That was grief talking and you knew it. [very quietly] Mom cried for you every night that week, kept setting your place at the dinner table out of habit.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I sent flowers, tried calling seventeen times, left messages that never got returned. [pause] What was I supposed to do, just show up after you explicitly told me to stay away?

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Yes! That's exactly what family does, they show up even when it's hard, even when someone's pushing them away because they're drowning in grief.

Character 2 [en]: The last time I didn't respect your boundaries, you called the cops on me, so forgive me for taking your words at face value this time.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] That was different and you know it, you were high out of your mind and trying to break into my apartment at three in the morning. [sighs] I was scared.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I've been clean for four years now, not that you'd know since you blocked my number and moved without telling anyone your new address.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Four years?

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Got my two-year chip the day Dad died actually, was going to surprise everyone at Sunday dinner. [clearing throat] Then I got your call telling me not to come home.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Oh God, Danny, I didn't know, I thought you were still using and I couldn't handle watching you self-destruct at his funeral. [sniffles] I was trying to protect Mom.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Mom knew I was clean, she's the one who drove me to meetings every week for the first six months. [pause] She never told you?

Character 1 [en]: [confused] She said you disappeared again, that she hadn't heard from you in months before Dad got sick. [whispering loudly] Why would she lie about that?

Character 2 [en]: [sighs] To protect you.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] She was afraid if you knew the truth, you'd blame yourself for keeping us apart all this time. [very quietly] Classic Mom, managing everyone's emotions even while grieving.

Character 2 [en]: [pause] So what now?

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Your drums are in Studio B like I said, but the session doesn't start until nine tomorrow morning. [warmly] There's terrible coffee in the break room if you want to catch up.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Coffee sounds good, even terrible coffee. [chuckles] I've got five years of apologies to get through, might need the whole pot.
