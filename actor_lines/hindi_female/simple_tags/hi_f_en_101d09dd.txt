=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [friendly] Good evening, um, this is Rachel speaking and I'm, [warm], available for whatever you need tonight so, uhh, what kind of experience were you, [flirtatious], looking for?

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Actually, this is a, [confused], professional call from DataPoint Research and I'm conducting a, [clearing throat], brief survey about consumer preferences in the, [hesitantly], service industry.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Oh right, a survey about, [chuckle], services at ten thirty on a Friday night.

Character 2 [en]: [overly polite] I understand it's, um, late but we're trying to, [anxious], reach people during their free time and, well, this should only take, [quickly], about fifteen minutes if you're willing to participate. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [bored] Look, honey, my time costs two hundred an hour whether we're, [playful], talking about surveys or anything else. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [stuttering] Wait, that voice sounds, um, familiar and I'm, [shocked], starting to think maybe this isn't, uhh, the right number because you sound exactly, [whispering], like someone I used to know really well.

Character 1 [en]: The thing is, [pause], you called this number so either you want, [bitter], what I'm offering or you've got the, [trailing off], wrong person entirely and I don't have time for...

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Sarah, oh my god, um, it's really you isn't it, I mean, [gasp softly], I recognize your voice now.

Character 3 [en]: [very quietly] Don't you dare, [angry], say my real name on this line, and how the hell did you, [furious], even get this number anyway?

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] It was random, I swear, um, the computer just generates numbers and I had, [crying while speaking], no idea you were doing this kind of, er, work now. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] Three years since you and mom, [very melancholic], kicked me out for being a disappointment and now you're, [mocking], calling to judge my choices again?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] No, Sarah, please, I've been, [regretful], trying to find you for months because mom's sick and she's been, [very sad], asking about you every single day and wanting to make things right.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] She made it pretty clear what she, [shouting], thought of me when she changed the locks while I was at, [bitter], rehab trying to get better.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] That was dad's decision and mom, [passionately], fought him on it but she was too weak then to stand up to him properly.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, um, I can't do this right now because I'm, [trembling], working and I've got real clients waiting so maybe we could, uhh, talk another time. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Please just give me, [desperate], five minutes to explain everything that's happened since you left.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You know what, fine, but this, [monotone], doesn't change anything between us and I'm only listening because apparently, [speeding up], you're paying for my time now anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Thank you, and I want you to know that, [very sincerely], whatever you're doing to survive, I'm not here to judge because we both know I've, [whispering loudly], made my own mistakes. [deep breath]

Character 1 [en]: [suspicious] So, um, what exactly happened to mom and why are you, [curious], suddenly reaching out now after all this, er, time when nobody gave a damn before, [frustrated], when I actually needed help?

Character 2 [en]: [very slowly] She has cancer, Sarah, and the doctors say she only has, [voice breaking], a few months left.
