=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [gasping] कोई है? वहाँ नीचे सच में कोई है? [very excited] अरे please, please मत जाइए, मैंने 3 साल से किसी को नहीं देखा है, and I was starting to think the world had forgotten this place exists!

Character 2 [mix]: [confused] ये क्या बकवास है? [loudly] सुनिए मैडम, आप वहाँ ऊपर बंद हैं क्या? मैं तो बस तूफ़ान से बचने अंदर आई थी, didn't know anyone lived in this ruin.

Character 1 [mix]: बंद, हाँ, actually शापित कहिए तो ज़्यादा सही होगा, if you believe in that sort of thing, वैसे इतने साल बाद पता नहीं क्या फ़र्क़ पड़ता है। [desperate] क्या आपको टावर के नीचे वो दरवाज़ा दिख रहा है?

Character 2 [mix]: [skeptical] हाँ दिख रहा है, जंग और बेल से ढका हुआ। [frustrated] देखिए, I don't want any trouble, alright? अगर ये कोई जाल है जहाँ आपके भाई मुझ पर हमला करेंगे, तो मैं अभी निकल जाती हूँ।

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] मेरे भाई समझते हैं कि मैं मर चुकी हूँ, everyone does. [very quietly] उन्होंने मेरा अंतिम संस्कार किया, खाली ताबूत पर भजन गाए, जबकि मैं इस खिड़की से चिल्लाती रही, but the enchantment makes my voice carry only so far.

Character 2 [mix]: [hesitantly] जादू? मैडम, आप वहाँ बहुत ज़्यादा समय से हैं अगर आपको लगता है कि कोई जादू आपको बंद रखे है, instead of just, you know, regular human cruelty and a strong lock.

Character 1 [mix]: आपको लगता है मैंने सब कुछ try नहीं किया? [angry] टूटे पत्थर खुद ठीक हो जाते हैं, पिघला ताला फिर से बन जाता है, and anyone who touches the door forgets why they came! [pause] लेकिन आप अभी भी यहाँ हैं, still talking to me.

Character 2 [mix]: [curious] शायद इसलिए क्योंकि मेरे पास और कहीं जाने को नहीं है। [sighs] बाहर तूफ़ान और बिगड़ रहा है, and honestly, talking to a possibly crazy tower princess beats freezing to death in the mud.

Character 1 [mix]: [warmly] आप घुमक्कड़ हैं ना? [excited] किसी राज्य से बंधी नहीं, कोई शपथ नहीं जो आपको मजबूर करे कि जो नहीं देखना वो ignore करो, just someone passing through who stumbled into the wrong story.

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] या फिर सही कहानी में।

Character 1 [mix]: [crying while speaking] ऐसी बातें मत कहिए unless you mean them. [shaky voice] उम्मीद सबसे क्रूर चीज़ है जो आप मुझे दे सकती हैं, if you're just going to walk away when the rain stops.

Character 2 [mix]: [passionately] मैं ज़िंदगी भर चीज़ों से दूर भागती रही हूँ, it's what I do best. [pause] लेकिन आपकी आवाज़ में कुछ है, the way it sounds like you're drowning up there in all that stone and silence.

Character 1 [mix]: [whispering loudly] मैं डूब रही हूँ, सालों से। [desperate] कभी-कभी भूल जाती हूँ मेरा नाम कैसा सुनाई देता है क्योंकि किसी ने बोला ही नहीं, forget what food tastes like beyond stale bread and water that appears each morning.

Character 2 [mix]: [empathetically] आपका नाम क्या है? [gently] मैं जानती हूँ कि मैं बस कोई अनजान हूँ जो बारिश से बचने आई, but I'd like to know who I'm talking to.

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] सेलेस्ट। [very quietly] पश्चिमी क्षेत्र की राजकुमारी सेलेस्ट, though I suppose those titles don't mean much when your kingdom's moved on without you. [sighs] आपको क्या कहते हैं, घुमक्कड़?

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] बस मार्कस। [hesitantly] कोई उपाधि नहीं, कोई राज्य नहीं, no tragic backstory worth telling. हालांकि अब लग रहा है कि शायद यही चाहिए इस स्थिति में, someone with nothing to lose.

Character 1 [mix]: [hopefully] क्या आप सच में कोशिश करेंगी? [anxious] ये जानते हुए भी कि ये आपको भी यहाँ फँसा सकता है, make you another ghost haunting this place, एक और आवाज़ जो इन पत्थरों से टकराती रहे जो हमें जाने नहीं देते?

Character 2 [mix]: [confidently] राजकुमारी, मैं तो पहले से ही भूत की तरह जी रही थी, drifting from place to place without anyone noticing I was there. [firmly] कम से कम यहाँ कोई तो मेरा नाम जानेगा।

Character 1 [mix]: [sobbing] मार्कस।

Character 2 [mix]: [very sincerely] मैं अब इस दरवाज़े को छूने जा रही हूँ, सेलेस्ट। [warmly] और अगर मैं भूल जाऊं कि क्यों आई थी, you keep saying my name until I remember, जब तक कुछ न टूटे, either the spell or me, लेकिन कुछ तो टूटना ही होगा। [pause] Ready?


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [gasping] A person? There's actually someone down there? [very excited] Please, please don't leave, I haven't seen another soul in three years and I was starting to think the world had forgotten this place exists!

Character 2: [confused] What the hell? [loudly] Lady, are you locked up there or something? I just came in here to get out of the storm, didn't know anyone lived in this ruin.

Character 1: Locked, yes, cursed actually if you believe in that sort of thing, though after this long I'm not sure what the difference is anymore. [desperate] Can you see the door at the base of the tower?

Character 2: [skeptical] Yeah, I see it, covered in rust and ivy. [frustrated] Look, I don't want any trouble, alright? If this is some kind of setup where your brothers jump me for trying to rescue you, I'm leaving right now.

Character 1: [bitter] My brothers think I'm dead, everyone does. [very quietly] They held my funeral, sang hymns over an empty coffin while I screamed from this window but the enchantment makes my voice carry only so far.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Enchantment? Lady, you've been up there too long if you think magic is keeping you locked away instead of just, you know, regular human cruelty and a strong lock.

Character 1: You think I haven't tried everything? [angry] The stones repair themselves when broken, the lock reforms when melted, and anyone who touches the door forgets why they came! [pause] But you're still here, still talking to me.

Character 2: [curious] Maybe because I don't have anywhere else to go. [sighs] Storm's getting worse out there and honestly, talking to a possibly crazy tower princess beats freezing to death in the mud.

Character 1: [warmly] You're a drifter, aren't you? [excited] No ties to any kingdom, no oaths binding you to ignore what you shouldn't see, just someone passing through who stumbled into the wrong story.

Character 2: [firmly] Or the right one.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] Please don't say things like that unless you mean them. [shaky voice] Hope is the cruelest thing you could give me right now if you're just going to walk away when the rain stops.

Character 2: [passionately] I've been walking away from things my whole life, it's what I do best. [pause] But there's something about your voice, the way it sounds like you're drowning up there in all that stone and silence.

Character 1: [whispering loudly] I am drowning, have been for years. [desperate] Sometimes I forget what my own name sounds like because no one's said it, forget what food tastes like beyond stale bread and water that appears each morning.

Character 2: [empathetically] What is your name? [gently] I know I'm just some nobody who wandered in from the rain, but I'd like to know who I'm talking to.

Character 1: [trembling] Celeste. [very quietly] Princess Celeste of the Western Reaches, though I suppose those titles don't mean much when your kingdom's moved on without you. [sighs] What do they call you, drifter?

Character 2: [quietly] Just Marcus. [hesitantly] No titles, no kingdom, no tragic backstory worth telling. Though I'm starting to think maybe that's exactly what this situation needs, someone with nothing to lose.

Character 1: [hopefully] Would you really try? [anxious] Even knowing it might trap you here too, make you another ghost haunting this place, another voice echoing off stones that won't let us go?

Character 2: [confidently] Princess, I've been a ghost most of my life already, drifting from place to place without anyone noticing I was there. [firmly] At least here someone would know my name.

Character 1: [sobbing] Marcus.

Character 2: [very sincerely] I'm going to touch this door now, Celeste. [warmly] And if I forget why I came, you keep saying my name until I remember, until something breaks, either the spell or me, but something's got to give. [pause] Ready?
