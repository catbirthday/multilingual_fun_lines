=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Um, excuse me, I think you've been, [hesitantly], taking the wrong recycling bin because, well, those pages you're holding, [shaky voice], they're from my personal manuscript. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I know, um, I mean, I've been, [warm], collecting them for months actually, not to, [anxious], throw them away but because, well, [very quietly], they're about someone I used to know.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, those are just fictional stories I've been, [frustrated], writing and throwing away because, I mean, they never felt quite right.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] The man you write about, [empathetically], he's my father who died working at that factory twenty years ago.

Character 1 [en]: That's impossible because I made up, [shocked], every detail about that character from my imagination, including his, [loudly], mannerisms and the way he, [whispering], talked to his children about dreams.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] He used to say dreams were like, [slowly], recycled hopes that kept coming back in different forms until you, [passionately], finally recognized them for what they really were.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, how could you possibly, well, [regretful], know that exact phrase when I've never shown anyone these pages? [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] Because he said it to me, [gently], every night before bed and somehow you captured his voice, [chuckling], perfectly in those discarded pages. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [stern] This doesn't make any sense because the character is based on, [curious], recurring dreams I've been having since childhood about a man I've never, [quickly], met who keeps trying to tell me something important.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Well, um, he worked the night shift and, [whispering loudly], sometimes he'd come home and watch you playing in the yard next door when you were, [very sincerely], maybe three or four years old, you know? [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] We moved away.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Um, I mean, he always wondered what happened to that little kid who, [tearfully], used to wave at him through the fence every morning. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] Well, um, I don't remember any of that but, [softly], these dreams have haunted me for decades, you know?

Character 2 [en]: The stories you throw away are the, [gratefully], only pieces of him I have left besides old photographs that can't, [mumbling], capture his voice the way your, [happily], words somehow do.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] Um, maybe these aren't really my stories to throw away after all, I mean, [hesitant], if they belong to someone else's memory then, [emotional], perhaps I've just been the vessel carrying them. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Every Tuesday when I collect your recycling, [determined], I find another chapter about him teaching someone to fix engines or, [nostalgically], telling stories about the stars and I keep them all, [carefully], preserved in plastic sleeves. [deep breath]

Character 1 [en]: [amazed] There must be hundreds of pages by now describing a life I somehow, [mysteriously], know intimately but never actually lived or, [wonderingly], witnessed firsthand.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Three hundred and forty-seven pages to be, [precisely], exact and each one feels like having him back for just a moment.

Character 1 [en]: [decided] Well, um, I should probably stop throwing them away and, [warmly], maybe we could piece together his whole story, you know? [softly laughs]

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully joyful] That would mean everything to me and my family who never really, [peacefully], got to say goodbye properly. [cries softly]
