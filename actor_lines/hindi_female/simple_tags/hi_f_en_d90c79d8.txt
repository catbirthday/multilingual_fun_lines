=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I wasn't expecting to see you here at this, [nervous], particular bench where people usually, [trailing off], meet for other reasons.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] I've been walking dogs in this park for years and I've, [bitter], noticed you here before with different, [quietly], women who aren't your wife. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, well, I mean...

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, Sarah shows me pictures of you two at church every Sunday looking, [disappointed], perfect together like nothing's wrong.

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Er, uh, please don't.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] The dogs always bark when they see you because they can, [confused], sense something dishonest about people who live, [slowly], double lives like this.

Character 1 [en]: Look, um, I know how this appears but you know my marriage has been, [exhausted], dead for years and I'm just trying to, [shaky voice], find some connection somewhere.

Character 2 [en]: [doubtful] Well, um, paying for intimacy doesn't seem like, [frustrated], the kind of connection that's going to, [empathetically], fix whatever's broken inside you, I mean, [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Sometimes the loneliness gets so overwhelming that even, [very quietly], temporary comfort feels better than the, [crying while speaking], emptiness at home.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I've watched you do this for months and each time you leave looking, [sad], more lost than when you arrived like you're, [passionately], searching for something that money can't, [very slowly], actually buy. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Um, well, you don't understand what it's like living with someone who, [angry], hasn't touched you in three years and treats you like, [monotone], furniture that pays bills, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Er, maybe not, but um, I understand watching my father do the same thing and seeing how it, [upset], destroyed my mother when she found out.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Look, I mean, I never wanted to become this person but, um, the alternative feels like, [trembling], slowly dying from the inside while pretending everything's, [bored], fine for the neighbors and her family, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Well, um, every Tuesday when I walk past your house, er, I see Sarah watering those roses alone and I wonder if she's, [melancholic], dying inside too while you're here seeking, [clearing throat], comfort from strangers, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [ashamed] The roses were supposed to be our project together but now they're just, [very sad], another reminder of promises we made before we, [whispering loudly], became strangers sharing a mortgage.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] You know, um, maybe both of you are drowning separately when you could, er, either swim together or at least be, [honest], honest enough to let each other find different, [relieved], shores to heal on. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Twenty years of shared history makes leaving feel like, [very meekly], admitting my whole life was a mistake.

Character 2 [en]: But continuing this charade while you meet escorts in the park makes those twenty, [firm], years a lie instead of just a, [gently], chapter that needs to end.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Maybe you should tell her since I'm clearly too much of a, [self-loathing], coward to do it myself.

Character 2 [en]: [modest] That's your truth.
