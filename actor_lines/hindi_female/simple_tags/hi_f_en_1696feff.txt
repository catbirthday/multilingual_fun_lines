Scenario: An underwater welder surfaces at a remote offshore oil rig to find their estranged daughter waiting on the platform, having tracked them down after years of no contact.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Jesus, Maya? What are you doing out here on the rig? [pause] This is restricted access, you can't just show up two hundred miles offshore because you feel like talking.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The platform manager owed me a favor from when I did his daughter's wedding photography last year. [quietly] I told him it was an emergency, that I needed to see my father before he disappeared under the water again for another five years.

Character 1 [en]: Five years isn't fair, it's been three at most, and you know I sent those birthday cards. [sighs] Look, I've got another dive in two hours, we're behind schedule on the pipeline inspection and the weather window's closing.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Birthday cards with no return address don't count as staying in touch, Dad. [frustrated] Mom's been sick, really sick, and I had to track you down through your union rep because you never updated your emergency contacts.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Your mother and I agreed it was better if I stayed away after everything that happened. [pause] The drinking, the fights, me missing your graduation because I was working a salvage job in the Gulf.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] You've been sober for eight years now according to Jimmy at the union hall. [empathetically] That's longer than you were drunk during my childhood, so maybe it's time to stop punishing yourself by living underwater.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] The water's where I'm useful, where I can fix things that actually stay fixed. [exhales] Up here, with people, with family, I just seem to break everything I touch eventually.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] That's bullshit, Dad.

Character 1 [en]: Maya, please.

Character 2 [en]: Mom has stage three lymphoma and she asked me to find you. [shaky voice] Not because she's dying, but because she's fighting, and she wants you to know you're allowed to come home.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Allowed to come home.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] I kept your welding helmet, the one with the shark teeth you painted on it when I was seven. [nostalgic] Remember how you'd let me wear it and pretend I was exploring shipwrecks with you?

Character 1 [en]: [chuckle] You could barely see through the lens, kept walking into walls, but you insisted you were a professional deep sea explorer. [trailing off] God, you were so determined to come with me on the boat...

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] I still am determined, just not about the diving part. [pause] I'm determined to drag you back to shore before you become one of those old welders who dies alone in a decompression chamber.

Character 1 [en]: [sighs] Maya, I don't know how to be a father anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Then don't be a father, just be a person who shows up. [firmly] Mom's next chemo appointment is Thursday at two, Presbyterian Hospital, third floor oncology ward.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Thursday's only three days away, I'd have to break my contract here, forfeit the completion bonus. [long pause] The crew chief will blacklist me from the next two jobs at least.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Your choice, Dad.

Character 1 [en]: I'll tell the chief I've got a family emergency, which I suppose is actually true for once. [committed] Thursday at two, Presbyterian Hospital, third floor.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Third floor. [pause] I'll be there too.
