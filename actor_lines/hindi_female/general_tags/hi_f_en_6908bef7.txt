Scenario: A reclusive landowner finds a famous rock band's groupie trespassing on their property after she got separated from the tour bus during a countryside festival.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [startled] You're trespassing on private, [firm], property and I need you to explain what you're, [suspicious], doing in my wheat field at three in the morning.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I got separated from, um, the tour bus after the festival and, well, I've been walking for, [desperate], hours trying to find my way back to, like, civilization or something. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] Tour bus—you mean from that, [annoyed], rock festival twenty miles away that's been keeping the whole county, [frustrated], awake for the past three nights?

Character 2 [en]: The music isn't just, [defensive], noise, it's about freedom and expression and connecting with something, [passionate], bigger than yourself. [laughs softly]

Character 1 [en]: [softer] Well, um, you look pretty rough so I guess, [reluctant], you'd better come inside and, er, use the phone or something.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You'd actually help a stranger who's been, [grateful], following a band around like some kind of, [self-deprecating], lost puppy? [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] My daughter used to chase, [wistful], dreams like that before she settled down.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Um, well, what happened?

Character 1 [en]: She married an accountant and moved to, [bitter], the suburbs where she posts pictures of casseroles and, [sad], pretends she never wanted to paint. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] That's exactly why I keep following the band even when people, [determined], think I'm wasting my life because settling feels like, [fearful], dying slowly from the inside, [trembling], out.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe you're right about that—I inherited this, [contemplative], land thirty years ago instead of going to architecture school.

Character 2 [en]: So you understand then, um, what it's like to have this, [yearning], hunger for something more while everyone tells you to, well, [frustrated], be practical and, you know, [resigned], grow up already.

Character 1 [en]: I still sketch buildings sometimes, um, late at night when, well, [vulnerable], nobody's watching. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] You could still do it, I mean, there's online courses now and, um, [hopeful], people start new careers at any age these days and, well, [excited], your experience with land would actually, like, make you unique.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitant] The thing is, um, I wouldn't even know where to, [overwhelmed], begin after all this time and, well, who would take an old farmer, [self-doubting], seriously in that world anyway? [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [firm] The same people who take a groupie seriously when, um, she writes about the music industry for, like, [proud], Rolling Stone under a pseudonym while everyone thinks I'm just, well, another starry-eyed fan.

Character 1 [en]: [amazed] Wait, you're actually, um, a writer who's been, [impressed], published in Rolling Stone?

Character 2 [en]: [confident] Three cover stories this year about the intersection of, [passionate], rural America and rock culture, which is exactly why I noticed your, [knowing], Frank Lloyd Wright books through the kitchen window.

Character 1 [en]: [moved] Maybe we both need to stop, um, hiding who we really, [determined], are. [laughs warmly]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I could use a quiet place to write my book and, you know, [hopeful], you could use someone who believes your sketches deserve to, er, [earnest], become real buildings.
