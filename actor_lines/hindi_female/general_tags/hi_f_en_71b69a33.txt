=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, I've been watching your, [broken], livestreams where you're celebrating the demolition of my building like it's, well, [bitter], some kind of entertainment, I mean, twenty years of my life being turned into content.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I document urban, [defensive], transformations for my three million followers who are genuinely, [measured], interested in watching cities evolve and change.

Character 1 [en]: [careful] Well, um, that building wasn't just concrete and glass, I mean, it was, [struggling], the first sustainable community center in this neighborhood that, [voice cracking], actually served the people who lived here. [sighs deeply]

Character 2 [en]: [softening] Um, I didn't know.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, every beam we placed had, [passionate], meaning, every window was positioned to bring light into spaces where, [choking up], kids would learn to read, where, [whispered], their grandparents would gather for meals. [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] The comments section keeps asking for more dramatic angles when the, [quiet], wrecking ball hits but now I'm realizing those walls held, [trailing off], actual memories.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] My daughter took her first steps in that lobby you filmed being, [hollow], crushed yesterday, the marble floor where she, [breaking], fell and got back up over and over.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Um, well, I could stop.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Stopping now won't bring back the community garden on the roof where, [nostalgic], neighbors grew tomatoes together or the library corner where, [gentle], teenagers found refuge after school.

Character 2 [en]: But I could tell their, [earnest], stories instead of just showing destruction. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Well, um, I mean, I have blueprints, photographs, recordings of the families who, [warming], made that space alive if you actually want to understand.

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] Those three million people who watch me should know what, [determined], we're actually losing here, not just what's, [firm], being torn down. [exhales slowly]

Character 1 [en]: [careful] Architecture isn't just about the structures we build but the, [philosophical], lives that unfold within them.

Character 2 [en]: Um, I'm, well, sorry. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, being sorry doesn't rebuild anything but, I mean, [thoughtful], maybe documenting what mattered there could help us, [stronger], remember why we build in the first place. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, I have this platform and, I mean, millions of people watching so maybe we could, [growing confidence], create something meaningful from this loss.

Character 1 [en]: [tired] Every city has ghost buildings that only exist in the, [wistful], memories of those who loved them, in the, [sad], stories we tell about what used to be, [cracking], there. [laughs sadly]

Character 2 [en]: So, um, let's make sure this one haunts people in a way that, [passionate], matters, that makes them think about, [urgent], what we destroy when we call it progress, makes them, [fierce], question every demolition they witness. [voice rising]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Um, well, maybe that's all we can do now, I mean, turn this, [fragile], grief into something that makes people, [determined], care.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] Then we start tomorrow morning before they take down the, [reverent], last wall, before the final pieces of your work, [emotional], disappear, before this becomes just another, [heavy], empty lot waiting for the next thing. [breathes deeply]
