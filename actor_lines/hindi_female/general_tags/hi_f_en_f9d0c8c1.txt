Scenario: A focus puller seeks help from a speech therapist after developing a stutter following a traumatic on-set accident where they filmed a stunt performer's fatal fall.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I, um, haven't been able to, [trembling], pull focus properly since the accident, and, well, my hands won't stop, [shaking], shaking whenever I touch the focus wheel, you know. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] The tremor and the speech blocks you're experiencing are both, [carefully], common responses to witnessing something that traumatic on set.

Character 1 [en]: [withdrawn] I mean, I was right there behind the camera when, um, when she fell, and I kept, [voice cracking], rolling because that's what we're trained to do—keep the shot, [hollow], no matter what happens. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] You were doing your job, um, but that doesn't mean you weren't, [measured], deeply affected by what you saw through that lens, I mean, being forced to watch something so terrible unfold.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Every time I close my eyes I see her face going, [breaking], out of focus as she fell past frame, and I can't stop, [haunted], thinking about how perfect the shot was.

Character 2 [en]: The guilt you're carrying about the technical perfection of that moment is, [understanding], manifesting in your speech and motor control. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: I, uhh, can't even say her name without my throat, [choking up], closing up completely, like, um, the words just get stuck behind my teeth and won't, [frustrated], come out anymore. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [professional] We'll work on graduated exposure therapy, um, starting with writing her name, then, [encouraging], whispering it, and, well, eventually speaking it aloud without the blocks.

Character 1 [en]: The other crew members keep calling to check on me but I can't, [ashamed], answer because they'll hear how broken I sound.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Your voice isn't broken—it's, [compassionate], protecting you from pain you're not ready to, [thoughtful], fully process yet, and that protection is actually a sign of, [reassuring], psychological resilience.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] But what if I never get back to who I was before, what if this, [fearful], stutter stays forever and I can't work in film again, what if I'm just, [lost], permanently damaged from watching her die?

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, damaged. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: I know that's not the right word but, um, that's how it feels when I try to speak and, [struggling], nothing comes out except these broken syllables that, uhh, don't even sound like me anymore, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] You're still you.

Character 1 [en]: [crying] Sometimes when I'm alone I practice saying 'rolling' and 'speed' over and over but, um, the words that used to be, [anguished], automatic now feel like glass in my mouth, and, well, I can't imagine ever calling action again. [shuddering]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] The technical language of filmmaking has become, um, traumatically linked to that moment, but, [hopeful], we can rebuild those neural pathways with new associations, like, creating safer contexts for those words.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I dream about pulling focus on her face and getting it perfectly, [monotone], sharp right as the platform gives way, then I wake up and can't, [gasping], breathe or speak for hours. [cries softly]

Character 2 [en]: [steady] Those dreams are your mind trying to, [clinical], process and file the trauma appropriately in your memory.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I just want to be able to say 'I'm sorry' to her family without, um, stuttering through every word like I'm, [defeated], somehow making their grief about my, uhh, inability to speak properly, you know, like even my apology is, [bitter], broken.

Character 2 [en]: [truthful] Your stutter doesn't diminish your grief or your, um, sincerity—if anything, it shows how deeply this loss has, [emotional], affected you, and I think, well, her family would understand that your voice is breaking because your, [cracking], heart is too.
