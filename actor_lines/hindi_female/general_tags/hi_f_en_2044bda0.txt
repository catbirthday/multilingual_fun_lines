=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervously] I, um, I wasn't expecting to see you here, Sarah. When they said the examiner's name, I thought maybe it was a different Sarah Chen, but then... well, here you are. [hollow laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [professionally gentle] It's been what, eight years since graduation? Look, if you're uncomfortable with me conducting this assessment, I can request another examiner, though it might delay your case by a few weeks.

Character 1 [en]: No, no, it's fine, really. I mean, we were barely friends back then anyway, right? Just, uh, lab partners that one semester. [swallows hard] You probably don't even remember.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] I remember the organic chemistry class, yes. Now, let's focus on why you're here—your file says chronic pain from a warehouse accident three months ago?

Character 1 [en]: [quieter] Yeah, forklift tipped over and, um, crushed my lower back. The pain's constant now, like this dull ache that never really goes away, even with the medication they give me.

Character 2 [en]: Can you describe how this affects your daily activities? I need specific examples for the assessment—things like, uh, getting dressed, preparing meals, sleeping patterns. [clicking pen]

Character 1 [en]: Everything hurts, Sarah.

Character 2 [en]: [patiently] I understand this is difficult, but I need you to be more specific. For instance, um, how long does it take you to get out of bed in the morning compared to before the accident?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] About forty-five minutes now, if I'm lucky. I have to roll sideways first, then kind of, you know, inch my way to the edge before I can even think about standing up.

Character 2 [en]: [typing] And you live alone, according to this form? Is there anyone who helps you with daily tasks, or, uh, someone you can call when things get particularly bad?

Character 1 [en]: There's nobody, okay? I mean, my mom offers sometimes but she lives two hours away and, honestly, I just... I can't have her seeing me like this. [voice breaking] It's humiliating enough being here.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] We're almost done with the physical assessment portion. I just need to observe your range of motion—can you, um, try to touch your toes for me? Just go as far as comfortable.

Character 1 [en]: [straining] I can't even reach my knees anymore. God, you know what's funny? I used to watch you in yoga class through the gym windows, thinking maybe I'd join someday, maybe we'd... [trails off]

Character 2 [en]: That's sufficient, you can sit back down. [pause] Look, based on what I'm documenting here, you should qualify for the full disability benefits, including home care assistance if you need it.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] I know this is unprofessional but, um, I thought about you a lot after college. Like, I'd see your updates online before I deleted everything, and I always wondered what would've happened if I'd just... said something.

Character 2 [en]: [carefully professional] Mr. Davidson, I think the pain medication might be affecting your judgment right now. Let's, uh, finish this assessment so you can get the help you need, okay?

Character 1 [en]: Right. Of course.

Character 2 [en]: [returning to form] Your case will be reviewed within two weeks, and you'll receive a determination letter. If approved, benefits would be retroactive to your initial injury date. Do you have any questions about the process?

Character 1 [en]: Just one, actually. That ring on your finger—is it, uh, recent? I mean, congratulations, I guess. [forced brightness] You always deserved someone who'd actually speak up, not just watch from across campus like an idiot.

Character 2 [en]: [gently firm] Three years next month. Listen, David, I'm approving expedited processing for your case—you should hear back within a week instead. Please, um, take care of yourself. [standing] The receptionist will validate your parking.
