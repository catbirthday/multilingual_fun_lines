=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Those counterfeit brake pads you sold me, [cold], last month just cost me my best customer when his engine seized up, [controlled fury], halfway to his daughter's wedding.

Character 2 [en]: [dismissive] Not my problem.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Well, um, actually it is your problem because, [precise], I kept every receipt and recorded our conversation where you, I mean, guaranteed these were OEM parts. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, uh, I never said they were, [shifting], factory original, I said they were, um, equivalent quality which is, you know, completely different legally speaking. [nervous laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [triumphant] Oh but see, um, that's where you're wrong because I have, [deliberate], the text messages where you literally wrote, well, 'genuine Toyota parts straight from the factory' and, [victorious], my lawyer finds that very interesting.

Character 2 [en]: [panicking] Your lawyer doesn't, [stammering], scare me since you can't prove those parts came from my shop.

Character 1 [en]: [smiling] Hmm, well, funny thing about that serial number you, um, tried to file off—forensics can still, [savoring], read it under UV light. [chuckles darkly]

Character 2 [en]: [cornered] So, uh, what exactly do you, well, want from me here because I mean, [desperate], we both know lawsuits take years.

Character 1 [en]: The state inspector who shut down, [ice cold], your warehouse this morning would probably disagree about, [satisfied], how long justice takes these days, um, wouldn't you say?

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, what?

Character 1 [en]: [casual] Oh you haven't checked your phone yet because, [amused], apparently they found quite the collection of counterfeit parts in, [gleeful], your back inventory room.

Character 2 [en]: [frantic] I, um, look, we can work something out here, I mean, [pleading], there's no need to destroy my entire business over one mistake. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] One mistake that could've killed someone, well, when those fake brake pads failed at highway speed, [disgusted], but sure, let's call it, um, just one mistake.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] I have the money to make this right, [begging], just tell me what it'll take to, [trembling], make you call off the inspector.

Character 1 [en]: [victorious] Well, um, it's a bit late for that since I already gave them, [savoring], your supplier list from that USB drive you thought you deleted.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] That USB was encrypted and, [hollow], hidden in my personal safe at home.

Character 1 [en]: Your ex-employee Marcus was very helpful after, [smug], I fixed his car for free and mentioned how you, [contemptuous], stiffed him on his last paycheck. [laughs]

Character 2 [en]: You planned this whole thing for, um, weeks didn't you, [bitter], gathering evidence and, well, setting me up like some kind of, I mean, [broken], elaborate revenge plot. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [triumphant] Every text, every email, [methodical], every falsified certificate you sent is already with the district attorney who, [satisfied], happens to be another satisfied customer of mine.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Well, um, you win.
