=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [distant] मैंने ये boards garage में पाए जब मैं, [confused], पापा की चीज़ें साफ कर रही थी, लेकिन ये इतने, [hollow], साफ-सुथरे लग रहे हैं जैसे वहाँ सालों से न रखे हों।

Character 2 [mix]: [quiet] तुम्हारे पिताजी हर 6 महीने इन्हें मेरे पास, [tired], maintenance के लिए लाते थे, even after he stopped surfing.

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] उन्होंने कभी नहीं बताया कि वो, उम्म, boards की देखभाल करते हैं या कि अभी भी, [drifting], इनकी परवाह करते हैं, I mean, he barely talked to me about anything, खैर, meaningful पिछले 10 सालों में। [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [mix]: [lethargic] '74 की Lightning Bolt उनकी, [measured], पसंदीदा थी, कहते थे याद दिलाती है जब तुम, [moody], छोटी थीं और वो तुम्हें कंधों पर बिठाकर, [nostalgic], dawn patrol sessions के बाद ले जाते थे। [long pause]

Character 1 [mix]: मैंने उन सुबहों के बारे में, [trembling], दशकों से नहीं सोचा, just buried them under spreadsheets and, [vacant], p-values और confidence intervals में।

Character 2 [mix]: [exhausted] हाँ, उम्म, ठीक है।

Character 1 [mix]: [withdrawn] जब भी अब surf wax की खुशबू आती है, उम्म, मुझे लगता है कि मैंने numbers को, [resentful], लहरों से ज़्यादा importance दी, you know, how I let the ocean become just another, [defeated], variable किसी और के research paper में बजाय, खैर, घर के।

Character 2 [mix]: [slow] वो समझते थे तुम क्यों गई थीं, even if he never, [heavy], तुमसे सीधे कहा, बस इन, [melancholic], boards से मेरी workshop में बात करते थे।

Character 1 [mix]: [barely audible] वो आपसे बात करते थे?

Character 2 [mix]: तुम्हारे बारे में लगातार, उम्म, हर published paper दिखाते थे जो तुमने भेजा था, even though he didn't, [proud], statistics समझते थे, बस कहते रहते थे उनकी बेटी, [wistful], math से जानें बचा रही है जबकि वो foam को, खैर, सपनों में ढाल रहे थे। [voice cracks]

Character 1 [mix]: [breaking] मुझे लगता था वो निराश हैं कि मैंने, उम्म, यहाँ रुककर surf shop नहीं संभाली, I mean, that I became everything this town isn't. [pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [gentle] तुम्हारे पिताजी जानते थे समुंदर हमेशा यहाँ रहेगा जब तुम, [understanding], वापस आने को तैयार होगी।

Character 1 [mix]: [lost] लेकिन मुझे अब लहरें पढ़ना याद नहीं, उम्म, just correlation coefficients and, खैर, survival curves।

Character 2 [mix]: [firm] समुंदर याद रखता है।

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] मैं, उम्म, मुझे नहीं पता।

Character 2 [mix]: ये boards तुम्हारा इंतज़ार कर रहे थे, just like he was, [patient], इंतज़ार करते रहे जब cancer ने उनकी आवाज़ छीनी और फिर, [fading], सब कुछ। [exhales slowly]

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] जब मैंने उनका medical data analyze किया, I found patterns that suggested earlier, [clinical], intervention से शायद 3 महीने और मिल सकते थे, but I was too, [guilty], देर से अपने models के साथ, दूसरों के, [hollow], datasets में इतनी खोई थी कि उनकी हालत समय पर नहीं देख पाई।

Character 2 [mix]: [soft] वो 3 महीने और hospitals के नहीं चाहते थे, just wanted to know his boards would find, [certain], तुम तक पहुंच जाएंगे। [long silence]

Character 1 [mix]: [whispered] क्या आप मुझे सिखाएंगी? [crying]

Character 2 [mix]: कल सुबह, 6 बजे, उम्म, dawn patrol, बिल्कुल जैसे वो तुम्हारे साथ, [reverent], करते थे, well, before the world got complicated. [sighs]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [distant] I found these boards in the garage when I was, [confused], cleaning out dad's things, but they look too, [hollow], pristine to have been sitting there for years.

Character 2: [quiet] Your father brought them to me every six months for, [tired], maintenance even after he stopped surfing.

Character 1: [bitter] He never mentioned anything about, um, maintaining boards or even that he still, [drifting], cared about them, I mean, he barely talked to me about anything, well, meaningful these last ten years. [sighs heavily]

Character 2: [lethargic] The '74 Lightning Bolt was his, [measured], favorite, said it reminded him of when you were, [moody], little and he'd carry you on his shoulders after, [nostalgic], dawn patrol sessions. [long pause]

Character 1: I haven't thought about those mornings in, [trembling], decades, just buried them under spreadsheets and, [vacant], p-values and confidence intervals.

Character 2: [exhausted] Well, um, yeah.

Character 1: [withdrawn] Every time I smell surf wax now, um, I think about how I chose numbers over, [resentful], waves, you know, how I let the ocean become just another, [defeated], variable in someone else's research paper instead of, well, home.

Character 2: [slow] He understood why you left, even if he never, [heavy], said it out loud to you, just to these, [melancholic], boards in my workshop.

Character 1: [barely audible] He talked to you?

Character 2: About you constantly, um, showed me every published paper you sent him, even though he didn't, [proud], understand the statistics, just kept saying his kid was, [wistful], saving lives with math while he shaped foam into, well, dreams. [voice cracks]

Character 1: [breaking] I thought he was disappointed that I didn't, um, stay here and take over the surf shop, I mean, that I became everything this town isn't. [pause]

Character 2: [gentle] Your father knew the ocean would always be here when you were, [understanding], ready to come back to it.

Character 1: [lost] But I don't remember how to read the waves anymore, um, just correlation coefficients and, well, survival curves.

Character 2: [firm] The ocean remembers.

Character 1: [trembling] I, um, I don't know.

Character 2: These boards have been waiting for you, just like he was, [patient], waiting even after the cancer took his voice and then, [fading], everything else. [exhales slowly]

Character 1: [desperate] When I analyzed his medical data, I found patterns that suggested earlier, [clinical], intervention might have bought him three more months, but I was too, [guilty], late with my models, too absorbed in other people's, [hollow], datasets to see his decline in time.

Character 2: [soft] He didn't want three more months of hospitals, just wanted to know his boards would find, [certain], their way back to you. [long silence]

Character 1: [whispered] Will you teach me? [crying]

Character 2: Tomorrow morning, six a.m., um, dawn patrol, just like he used to, [reverent], do with you, well, before the world got complicated. [sighs]
