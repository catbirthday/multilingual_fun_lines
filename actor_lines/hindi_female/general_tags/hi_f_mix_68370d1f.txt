=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] Um, I know this is weird calling you after, well, [breaking], 15 years, लेकिन मुझे नहीं पता था कि इस, uh, गड़बड़ में मेरी मदद और कौन कर सकता है।

Character 2 [mix]: [gentle] Hey, it's okay, मैं यह [professional], mediation का काम 10 साल से कर रही हूं और honestly, [warm], पुराने दोस्तों की मदद करना ही वो वजह है जिसके लिए मैं [careful], पहली जगह में इस field में आई थी। [soft exhale]

Character 1 [mix]: Um, well, thanks.

Character 2 [mix]: So tell me what's happening with the, [concerned], business partnership, क्योंकि तुम्हारे message से तो लगा कि चीज़ें [heavy], काफी बिगड़ चुकी हैं already, um, मैं सही कह रही हूं ना?

Character 1 [mix]: [wilting] The thing is, we started this company together 5 years ago, और अब वो [bitter], कह रही है कि मैंने बेचने की बात करके सब कुछ धोखा दिया जो हमने बनाया था, लेकिन बात [defeated], बिल्कुल पैसों की नहीं है। [long sigh]

Character 2 [mix]: [thoughtful] Um, when you say 'she,' मेरा मतलब है, [realizing], क्या हम Sarah की बात कर रही हैं, तुम्हारी wife?

Character 1 [mix]: [crumbling] Yeah, um, और divorce के papers already file हो चुके हैं लेकिन फिर भी हमें, well, [hollow], अगले 6 महीने तक साथ में यह company चलानी होगी जब तक contracts expire नहीं हो जाते, er, किसी तरह।

Character 2 [mix]: [compassionate] Oh God, that's, um, incredibly difficult—एक [measured], professional relationship maintain करने की कोशिश करना जब तुम्हारा personal relationship, well, [pained], टूट रहा हो, ऐसा लगता होगा जैसे हर दिन तुम आधी-आधी फट रही हो। [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [raw] Every morning I sit in that office and pretend, [choking up], pretend करती हूं कि 20 साल कभी हुए ही नहीं, कि हमने [trembling], सब कुछ शून्य से साथ में नहीं बनाया, including यह stupid company जो अब हमारे पास बची एकमात्र चीज़ है।

Character 2 [mix]: [steady] Listen, I've mediated dozens of, [purposeful], business dissolutions between couples, और सबसे मुश्किल हिस्सा हमेशा यह होता है कि [knowing], जिसका शोक मनाना है उसे उससे अलग करना जिसपर negotiate करना है। [breathes deeply]

Character 1 [mix]: Um, I don't even know the difference anymore, er, सब कुछ ऐसा लगता है, well, जैसे मैं किसी ऐसे इंसान के भूत से negotiate कर रही हूं जिसे मैं कभी जानती थी।

Character 2 [mix]: [giving] Remember when we were kids, और तुमने मुझे वो [nostalgic], चीज़ सिखाई थी fishing lines को सुलझाने के बारे में?

Character 1 [mix]: [confused] Um, what? मेरा मतलब है, हां, हम Miller's तालाब पर मछली पकड़ने जाते थे लेकिन, uh, [lost], मुझे समझ नहीं आ रहा कि यह कैसे relevant है इस पूरी, well, तबाही से जो मैं अभी जी रही हूं। [shaky laugh]

Character 2 [mix]: [unified] You said you can't yank at the knots, वरना वे [gentle], और tight हो जाती हैं—तुम्हें हर line को धैर्य से follow करना होता है यह देखने के लिए कि वो [meaningful], actually कहाँ फंसी है, और यही हम यहाँ करने जा रही हैं। [soft smile in voice]

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] God, I can't believe you remember that, um, जब हम क्या थीं, जैसे, [warming], 12 साल की उस टूटी हुई dock पर बैठी हुई अपनी, er, सस्ती fishing rods के साथ?

Character 2 [mix]: Some lessons stick because they're, [reflective], true about more than what they seem to be about, और अभी, well, [focused], तुम्हारी और Sarah की लगभग 15 उलझी हुई lines हैं जिन्हें हमें अलग करना होगा, um, एक-एक करके। [determined]

Character 1 [mix]: [hopeful] So you think there's actually a way through this, जो, um, [vulnerable], हमारे बनाए सब कुछ को destroy करने पर खत्म नहीं होता या, well, [fearful], हमेशा के लिए एक-दूसरे से नफरत करने पर?

Character 2 [mix]: [assured] Um, well, शायद।

Character 1 [mix]: [grateful] Thank you for not giving me false hope, लेकिन साथ ही [emotional], मुझे इसमें डूबने भी नहीं दे रही क्योंकि मैं [voice breaking], महीनों से डूब रही थी और किसी ने notice भी नहीं किया कि मैं struggle कर रही थी।

Character 2 [mix]: [loving] That's what old friends are for—हम याद रखती हैं कि तुम [tender], इस सब से पहले कौन थी और तुम्हें [giving], वापस solid ground तक पहुंचने में मदद कर सकती हैं।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [desperate] Um, I know this is weird calling you after, well, [breaking], fifteen years but I didn't know who else could help with this, uh, mess.

Character 2: [gentle] Hey, it's okay, I've been doing this, [professional], mediation work for a decade now and honestly, [warm], helping old friends is why I got into this field in the, [careful], first place. [soft exhale]

Character 1: Um, well, thanks.

Character 2: So tell me what's happening with the, [concerned], business partnership because from your message it sounded like things are, [heavy], pretty far gone already, um, am I right about that?

Character 1: [wilting] The thing is, we started this company together five years ago and now she's, [bitter], saying I betrayed everything we built by wanting to sell, but it's not, [defeated], it's not about the money at all. [long sigh]

Character 2: [thoughtful] Um, when you say 'she,' I mean, [realizing], are we talking about Sarah, your wife?

Character 1: [crumbling] Yeah, um, and the divorce papers are already filed but we still have to, well, [hollow], run this company together for another six months until the contracts expire, er, somehow.

Character 2: [compassionate] Oh God, that's, um, incredibly difficult—trying to maintain a, [measured], professional relationship while your personal one is, well, [pained], dissolving must feel like you're being torn in half every single day. [pause]

Character 1: [raw] Every morning I sit in that office and pretend, [choking up], pretend that twenty years didn't happen, that we didn't build, [trembling], everything from nothing together, including this stupid company that's now all we have left.

Character 2: [steady] Listen, I've mediated dozens of, [purposeful], business dissolutions between couples and the hardest part is always separating, [knowing], what needs to be grieved from what needs to be negotiated. [breathes deeply]

Character 1: Um, I don't even know the difference anymore, er, everything feels like, well, like I'm negotiating with a ghost of someone I used to know.

Character 2: [giving] Remember when we were kids and you taught me that, [nostalgic], thing about untangling fishing lines?

Character 1: [confused] Um, what? I mean, yeah, we used to fish at Miller's pond but, uh, [lost], I don't see how that's relevant to this whole, well, disaster I'm living through right now. [shaky laugh]

Character 2: [unified] You said you can't yank at the knots or they, [gentle], get tighter—you have to follow each line patiently to see where it's, [meaningful], actually caught, and that's exactly what we're going to do here. [soft smile in voice]

Character 1: [surprised] God, I can't believe you remember that, um, from when we were what, like, [warming], twelve years old sitting on that broken dock with our, er, cheap fishing rods?

Character 2: Some lessons stick because they're, [reflective], true about more than what they seem to be about, and right now, well, [focused], you and Sarah have about fifteen tangled lines that we need to separate, um, one at a time. [determined]

Character 1: [hopeful] So you think there's actually a way through this that doesn't, um, [vulnerable], end with us destroying everything we built or, well, [fearful], hating each other forever?

Character 2: [assured] Um, well, maybe.

Character 1: [grateful] Thank you for not giving me false hope but also not, [emotional], letting me drown in this because I've been going under for, [voice breaking], months and nobody else even noticed I was struggling.

Character 2: [loving] That's what old friends are for—we remember who you, [tender], were before all this and can help you find, [giving], your way back to solid ground.
