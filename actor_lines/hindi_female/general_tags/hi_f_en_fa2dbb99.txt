=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [startled] You shouldn't be back here in the, [nervous], restricted area—security will have my head if they find out I let, [whispering], anyone near the dressing rooms.

Character 2 [en]: [defiant] I know who you are.

Character 1 [en]: Look, um, I don't know what you think you, [confused], saw but I'm just part of the, [panicking], crew here helping with costume changes and, [stammering], makeup touch-ups for the show tonight.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] You're wearing her face but you're not, [trembling], my sister—I've watched you practice her, [hollow], smile in the mirrors for weeks while she's been, [breaking], gone.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] How long have you, um, known?

Character 2 [en]: Since the accident, um, three months ago when they said she needed, [quiet], time to recover but then you showed up pretending to, well, be her.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Um, I'm so sorry.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] Everyone keeps lying to me about where she, [desperate], really is and whether she's even still, [voice cracking], alive anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, they're lying.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I need to know the truth about what, um, happened to Maya—is she in some hospital somewhere or did she, well, actually die that night? [chokes]

Character 1 [en]: She's alive but she's, um, not the same person you remember—the accident changed, [heavy], everything about her and she can't, [struggling], perform anymore which is why they, well, hired me. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [angry] They replaced her like she was just some, [disgusted], broken toy instead of letting her fans know the, [shaking], truth about what happened.

Character 1 [en]: [guilty] Your parents thought it would destroy her, [conflicted], career if people knew she couldn't sing or dance anymore so they made this, [ashamed], arrangement to protect her future earnings and, [trailing off], legacy.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] But I just want my sister back, um, not some perfect illusion of who she, [broken], used to be—I don't care if she can't, well, perform anymore, I just need to, [desperate], see her again. [sobs]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] She's at a rehabilitation facility upstate, um, learning to walk and talk again—I can, well, give you the address if you promise not to tell anyone I, [worried], told you.

Character 2 [en]: You'd really risk your, [surprised], job for me?

Character 1 [en]: Um, nobody should have to lose their sister twice. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] I'm going to see her tomorrow no matter what my, [fierce], parents say—will you help me figure out how to, [hopeful], get there without them knowing?

Character 1 [en]: [resolute] Meet me here after the show tonight and, um, I'll drive you there myself.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Thank you for being the only, [relieved], honest person in this whole nightmare.
