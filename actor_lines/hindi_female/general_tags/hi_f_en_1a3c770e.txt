Scenario: A pediatrician confronts their grandmother who's been treating their infant great-grandchild with potentially dangerous folk remedies while babysitting.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Grandma, we need to talk about what you've been putting on Maya's chest—the nurse said she smelled like kerosene and mustard when you brought her in for her checkup yesterday.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] That's my mother's chest rub recipe, passed down through four generations, and it's kept every baby in this family healthy through winter colds and worse.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Kerosene is a petroleum product that can cause chemical burns on infant skin, and inhaling those fumes can damage her developing lungs—this isn't about tradition, it's about safety.

Character 2 [en]: You modern doctors think you know everything with your expensive medicines, but we raised twelve children in my village without a single pediatrician, and they all survived just fine. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: [quietly intense] Actually, infant mortality in your village was thirty percent back then—I've seen the health ministry records—so not everyone survived, they just didn't talk about the ones who didn't.

Character 2 [en]: [stung] How dare you throw statistics at me when I'm talking about real children, real families who trusted these remedies when there was nothing else available to them?

Character 1 [en]: [softer] I'm not dismissing what you and your mother did with limited resources, but we have better options now, safer ones that actually work without the risks.

Character 2 [en]: Better options like those antibiotics you prescribe for everything? My neighbor's grandson got those and still ended up in the hospital. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: That's different—

Character 2 [en]: [building momentum] No, you listen to me—I've been caring for babies since before you were born, changed your diapers, stayed up all night when you had fever, and now you question my judgment?

Character 1 [en]: [steadying breath] You taught me to care for others, yes, but my medical training taught me why some of those old remedies work and why others are dangerous—can't we combine both kinds of knowledge?

Character 2 [en]: Combine? You mean let you decide what's acceptable from my experience and throw away the rest like it's superstition and ignorance? [voice shaking]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Grandma, remember when you used honey for my scraped knees? That actually has antibacterial properties—modern medicine proved you were right about that one.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitant] You never told me that before—you always just brought out those tubes of medicine whenever the children got hurt around here.

Character 1 [en]: [warming] Because antibiotic ointment works faster, but honey does work—there are studies now showing exactly why your grandmother's remedies helped, and we can honor that wisdom while updating the methods.

Character 2 [en]: [cautiously hopeful] So you're saying some of what I know isn't worthless, just needs to be, [pauses], adjusted for these times?

Character 1 [en]: Exactly—like your chamomile tea for upset stomachs is perfect, but maybe we skip the kerosene and use vapor rub instead for congestion.

Character 2 [en]: [chuckles] Your grandfather would roll over in his grave hearing me agree to store-bought remedies, but I suppose if it keeps Maya safe while still letting me help...

Character 1 [en]: [enthusiastically] We could make a list together of all your remedies, and I'll research which ones have scientific backing—you'd be amazed how many traditional practices are being validated now.

Character 2 [en]: [proudly] Well then, Doctor, you better get your notebook because I know at least forty recipes, and if we're doing this, we're doing it properly. [determined]
