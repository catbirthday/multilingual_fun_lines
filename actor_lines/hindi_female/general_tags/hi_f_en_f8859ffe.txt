=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] I remember your small hands bringing me, [melting], sugar cubes through the fence when you were just seven years old. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: You can't be the same, um, [stunned], sheep from the children's petting area, I mean, [voice breaking], that was fifteen years ago and you were already, well, [disbelief], fully grown back then.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, um, you called me Cloudberry because of my, [nostalgic], white wool, and, er, you used to sneak me funnel cake pieces when your father wasn't looking.

Character 2 [en]: [shaking] This is, umm, [overwhelmed], impossible—they said you went to a farm upstate, but here you are in the, well, [horrified], auction pen for the slaughterhouse buyers, you know?

Character 1 [en]: I've been here all along, um, [gentle], winning ribbons for the fairgrounds, bringing in prize money that, well, [resigned], kept this place running, but now I'm, like, [accepting], too old to compete anymore, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] My father never told me you were still, [anguished], here all these years. [chokes up]

Character 1 [en]: He protected you from the, [understanding], truth about what happens to animals like me when we're no longer, [peaceful], useful for showing.

Character 2 [en]: [frantic] But I manage the concessions now, and, um, [determined], I have savings, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Sweet child, you still have those same, [tender], kind eyes, but some things in life are, [yielding], bigger than what our hearts want.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] I can't, well... [trails off]

Character 1 [en]: You gave me fifteen years of, [grateful], gentle visits and secret treats that made my life, [thankful], worth living.

Character 2 [en]: There has to be something I can, [desperate], do to stop this. [sobs]

Character 1 [en]: [soothing] Remember me the way I was, um, [fond], in those summer afternoons when you read me stories through the fence and, well, [wistful], taught me that humans could be kind, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [breaking] You understood every word I said back then, [realization], didn't you, and you've been, [guilt-ridden], waiting here all this time.

Character 1 [en]: Every fair season I watched for you, [hopeful], hoping you'd come back, and when you finally did last week wearing that manager's badge, [bittersweet], I knew it was time. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [fierce] I'm buying you myself, um, [determined], right now, and I don't care what it costs or, well, [defiant], what my father says about it, you know? [steadies]

Character 1 [en]: The auction already ended an hour ago, [heavy], and the transport truck is already here, but knowing you tried to, [moved], save me is more than most of us ever, [grateful], get in the end. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [sobbing] I should have come back sooner, [regretful], should have asked about you, should have, [broken], known they were lying about the farm upstate.

Character 1 [en]: You were a child who, um, [forgiving], loved a sheep, and that love was real even if, well, [serene], the world around us wasn't kind enough to honor it, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [hollow] I'll never forgive myself for, [devastated], this.
