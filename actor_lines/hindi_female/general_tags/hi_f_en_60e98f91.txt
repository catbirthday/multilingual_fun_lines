Scenario: A music supervisor working late in an empty recording studio encounters the ghost of a legendary musician who died recording their final album in that very room decades ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [ethereal] You're working on my last song, the one I, [hollow], never finished recording before the overdose took me. [sighs deeply]

Character 2 [en]: [startled] Holy shit, you're actually, [trembling], standing there in the booth where you, [voice cracking], died forty-three years ago, aren't you?

Character 1 [en]: [melancholic] I've been, um, watching people try to, well, complete it for decades, but you're the first one who, [passionate], understands what I was trying to say.

Character 2 [en]: Your family hired me to, um, supervise the posthumous album but I mean, [overwhelmed], I never expected to actually encounter you here, [shaking], still trying to finish what you started.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Listen, I need you to, er, understand something—the bridge section everyone thinks is, well, missing wasn't lost, it was, [intense], never recorded because I couldn't find the right, um, progression to capture what I felt dying.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] The master tapes have this, [careful], seventeen-second gap where you stopped singing and just, [heavy], breathed into the microphone before the engineer found you, [breaking], collapsed in the booth. [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: That breathing was, um, supposed to be the intro to something I'd been, well, hearing in my head for months, something about, [yearning], crossing over while the music still, er, played in my veins. [whispers]

Character 2 [en]: [moved] So you've been trapped here, um, trying to sing a song about, I mean, death while already being, [awed], dead for four decades?

Character 1 [en]: Not trapped exactly, more like, [searching], choosing to stay until someone could help me finish what started killing me long before the drugs did.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Well, um, okay then.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] I can, er, show you the melody if you're willing to, um, feel it rather than just, [pleading], hear it—it requires letting go of everything you, well, think you know about, [mystical], how music moves through dimensions. [echoing]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] I've spent twenty years helping artists find their, [passionate], voice in life, so maybe I can help you find yours in, [reverent], death, even if it means recording something nobody else will, [trembling], believe is real.

Character 1 [en]: The industry will think you've, um, lost your mind when you, er, present them with a track featuring vocals from someone who's been, [wry], dead since before you were born. [laughs sadly]

Character 2 [en]: [fierce] Let them think whatever they, [defiant], want—this is about completing your legacy, not about, [emotional], their narrow understanding of what's possible. [steadying]

Character 1 [en]: [urgent] We have to work quickly because I can only, well, manifest clearly when the studio is empty and the, um, electromagnetic interference from the old analog equipment creates the right, [fading], conditions for me to be heard.

Character 2 [en]: [focused] Then we'll work through the night using the, [excited], original board you recorded on, mixing your spectral voice with the, [breathless], unfinished tracks until we capture what you've been trying to, [determined], sing all these years. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You know, most people run when they, [warming], see me, but you're sitting down at the console like collaborating with, [touched], a ghost is just another Tuesday night in the, [amused], music business.

Character 2 [en]: [smiling] I've worked with enough tortured artists to know that, [knowing], death doesn't always stop the music—sometimes it just, [profound], changes the frequency.

Character 1 [en]: [peaceful] After forty-three years of haunting this booth, watching technology, [nostalgic], change and music evolve without me, I finally found someone who, [emotional], can hear what I've been singing into the void. [sighs softly]

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] So let's make history by recording the first posthumous collaboration that's, [inspired], actually posthumous.
