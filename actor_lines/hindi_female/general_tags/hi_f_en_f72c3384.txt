Scenario: A motion designer returns to their rural hometown to document the demolition of the century-old grain elevator where their father worked his entire life, meeting the current operator who will lose their job tomorrow.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: My father worked here for, [quiet], forty-three years and never missed a single, [heavy], harvest until the cancer took him last, [trembling], spring.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] I remember him showing me how to read the, [thoughtful], moisture levels when I first started here twenty years, [distant], ago.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] He used to say, um, the grain dust smelled like, [nostalgic], bread that hadn't been born yet, you know, like possibility waiting to happen. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, tomorrow at noon they're bringing the, [bitter], wrecking ball and, I mean, that's the end of possibility for this place, I guess.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I'm filming it for a documentary about, [careful], dying small towns but honestly I wish I wasn't.

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, there's still two thousand, [frustrated], bushels of wheat in silo three that, well, nobody wants to deal with before demolition because, [defeated], the company already wrote it off as a loss anyway.

Character 1 [en]: That wheat traveled maybe, [wondering], fifteen miles from the Henderson farm to sit here, [sad], abandoned while some corporate office decided this place wasn't, [angry], profitable enough to maintain. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [weary] The nearest elevator after tomorrow will be, [matter-of-fact], seventy miles away which means half these farms won't, [hollow], survive another season.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Dad would've, um, fought this somehow, you know, probably chained himself to the, [wistful], loading dock or something equally stubborn.

Character 2 [en]: [honest] Well, I mean, I thought about it myself but, um, I've got two kids in college and, [practical], no pension if I make trouble so here we, [defeated], are.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Would you be willing to talk on camera about what this, [earnest], place really means to the community? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [reluctant] I don't know, um, what good it would do now but, well, maybe someone should, [resolved], remember how we fed half the state from this, [proud], rusted old tower.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] My fancy motion graphics can't capture the, [searching], sound of grain flowing like water or how the whole building, [remembering], hums during harvest but your stories, [hopeful], might.

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, your dad once told me that, well, grain elevators are like, [philosophical], cathedrals for farmers.

Character 1 [en]: They store more than grain don't they—they hold the, [understanding], weight of every harvest moon and failed crop and, [emotional], family farm that got passed down through, [cracking], generations.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Um, I've got the keys to the, [conspiratorial], observation deck if you want to film from up there, you know, before it all comes down.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] I thought, um, that was sealed off years ago, well, after the, [worried], insurance company declared it unsafe.

Character 2 [en]: [defiant] What are they going to do, [dry laugh], fire me twelve hours early?

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Dad used to, um, take me up there to watch the, [tender], sunset paint the wheat fields gold and, well, I haven't been brave enough to, [voice breaking], go alone since he died.

Character 2 [en]: [kind] Well, um, you won't be alone today and, I mean, neither will I when this, [steadying], place comes down tomorrow. [long pause]
