Scenario: A discharge planner discovers the terminal patient they're processing has secretly arranged for cryopreservation, forcing an urgent confrontation with the specialist who's arrived to begin preparations.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [tense] You can't just, um, well, walk in here and start, [suspicious], preparing equipment for a procedure that hasn't been, I mean, cleared through proper channels.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Mr. Harrison signed all the, [calm], necessary documents three weeks ago when his diagnosis became, [quieter], terminal and time-sensitive arrangements had to be, [measured], made immediately. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Terminal patients need hospice referrals and, um, I mean, grief counseling for families, not, [disbelief], experimental freezing procedures that, well, give false hope to desperate people.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] False hope? [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Look, I've been doing this for, um, fifteen years and I've never had someone try to, well, [trembling], bypass end-of-life protocols for, you know, science fiction fantasies.

Character 2 [en]: [steady] What you call science fiction is, [passionate], advancing every year with new vitrification techniques that minimize, [earnest], cellular damage and preserve neural structures better than we've ever, [hopeful], achieved before. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] His daughter is flying in from Seattle expecting to, um, say goodbye properly, not, [breaking], find her father being prepped for, well, liquid nitrogen storage like he's some kind of, er, specimen.

Character 2 [en]: She knows about, [careful], his decision and supports it because she understands, [softer], this is his only chance at seeing her children grow up.

Character 1 [en]: [incredulous] Children that don't exist yet.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] But might, [emotional], someday when revival becomes possible and he could wake to a world where his cancer is curable.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] That's not how death works.

Character 2 [en]: [philosophical] Death used to mean when the, [contemplative], heart stopped beating until we learned to restart them, then it meant, [intense], brain death until we discovered neural plasticity could recover from what we thought was, [trailing off], irreversible.

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] Even if I wanted to help, which I, um, don't, the hospital administration would, [worried], never allow a cryopreservation team to operate here, and, well, moving him now could, [strained], kill him before you even get started.

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] That's why we need to work, [pleading], together because the window between legal death and cellular degradation is, [desperate], measured in minutes not hours and every second we argue is, [pained], neural tissue he'll never recover. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] I'd be risking my entire career for something that, um, might not even, [doubtful], work—something that sounds like, well, playing God with corpses.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] We're not playing, [sincere], God—we're just pressing pause on the inevitable, [tender], hoping someone smarter than us figures out how to press play again. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] How long would the preparation take?

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Four hours from the moment his heart, [technical], stops to full vitrification if everything goes perfectly, [tense], but we need your help navigating the legal documentation to make it, [determined], legitimate.

Character 1 [en]: I must be losing my mind but, [defeated], fine—walk me through exactly what needs to happen so I can, [exhausted], figure out how to make this work without destroying both our careers in the, [hollow], process.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Thank you for giving him, [emotional], this chance even if you don't believe in it—hope is sometimes all we, [choked up], have left to offer. [pause]
