[bitter] gone? Because of what, some filing deadline we missed by, er, three days? [frustrated] Are you actually kidding me right now? I mean, the depositions alone took, you know, six months. Six months! [angry] And the medical records, oh God, the medical records were literally a nightmare to track down. [sarcastic] But sure, yeah, a technicality. That's just—that's perfect. [laugh] You know what? [very loudly] This is insane! My daughter, she still can't, um—[shaky voice] she still has the scars from when that thing basically exploded in her face, and they're saying what? [mocking] \"Sorry, paperwork issue\"? [long pause] I honestly don't even know how to, like... [exhausted] how do I tell my family? We were so—God, we were actually so close. The lawyer said, er, he said we had them. [very quietly] He promised we had them. [sigh] Two years. All those meetings, all that hope, and it's just... [trailing off] I guess that's it then. [very sad] That's really it."
