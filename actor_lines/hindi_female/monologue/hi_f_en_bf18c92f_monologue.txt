Speaker [en]: [happy] Look at him up there, I mean—God, he's actually doing it. [shaky voice] Eight years ago, he was just this kid sitting at my kitchen table, you know, crying because he thought he'd never, [pause] never be able to afford it. And I remember, um, pulling out my savings account statement and just—[chuckle] the look on his face when I said we were gonna make this work. [crying while speaking] All those double shifts I picked up, and honestly, the ramen dinners, the, uh, the second job at the warehouse—[sniffle] it was all worth it for this exact moment. Like, [warm] watching him walk across that stage in his cap and gown, knowing he's Doctor Martinez now, not just my little brother who used to, er, steal my Halloween candy. [gasp softly] Mom would've been so—[shaky voice] she would've been so proud. I mean, [very sincerely] I basically raised him after she died, right? So this is kind of—it's just that—[pause] [relieved] we actually did it. We really, actually did it. [smiling speaking] And next month he starts his residency at Johns Hopkins, which is, hmm, absolutely insane. [very quietly] Sometimes I wonder what I could've done if I'd had someone to help me like that, but—[happy] no, this is his moment. [exhausted] God, I'm so tired but so, so happy.
