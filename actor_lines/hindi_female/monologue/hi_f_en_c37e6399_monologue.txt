Speaker [en]: [hesitantly] Okay, um, here goes nothing with this thing again. I mean, honestly, I've been avoiding this bindery machine for like—what, three months now? [nervous laugh] Every time someone asked me to bind something I'd just, you know, make up some excuse about the copier needing me or whatever. [pause] But today I actually—wait, is that click supposed to happen? [confused] Oh. Oh my God, that's... that's actually right. [excited] The alignment guide just, er, clicked into place exactly like Sarah showed me! 

[speeding up] Okay okay okay, so now I feed the papers through and—holy shit, it's working! [laugh] I mean, look at that, the spine is actually forming properly! Not like last time when I basically created this, uhh, twisted disaster that looked like modern art or something. [cheerful] You know what? I think I've actually got this! 

[very excited] The punch went through clean, the coil is threading perfectly—I'm literally doing this! [laugh loudly] Three months of being terrified of this stupid machine and now I'm just—[triumphant] boom, done! [relieved] God, I feel so ridiculous for putting this off for so long. But hey, at least now I can actually, you know, stop hiding in the supply closet whenever someone needs binding done. [chuckle]
