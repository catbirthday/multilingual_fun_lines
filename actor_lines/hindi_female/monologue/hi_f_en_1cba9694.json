Big bright sign, \"Phone Fix Express\" or whatever corporate nonsense they call themselves. [sigh] And suddenly everyone's walking past my shop like it doesn't even exist anymore. [very melancholic] I used to know every customer by name. Mrs. Chen with her cracked iPad every few months. [chuckle] That kid Tommy who somehow managed to drop his phone in the toilet twice. [pause] Now they're all lining up across the street because, I don't know, because the franchise has shinier posters? [angry] They don't even do real repairs! It's all just swap-outs and warranty void stickers. [quietly] But people don't care about that, do they? They see the big logo and think it's, um... it's somehow better. [regretful] Maybe I should've modernized. Done the fancy website thing. [groan] God, I can't even compete with their prices. They're practically giving away screen protectors just to get people in the door. [slowly] I've got two months left on the lease. After that... [trailing off] I honestly don't know what I'm going to do."
