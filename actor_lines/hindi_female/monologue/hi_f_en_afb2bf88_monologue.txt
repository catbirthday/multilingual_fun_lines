Speaker [en]: [mumbling] Just replacing these old pipes, same as always—wait, what the... [curious] There's something behind this wall panel. Um, these look like... are these newspapers? [gasp softly] 1863? Holy—these are Civil War era. And there's more stuff, like, there's a whole cache back here. [excited] Oh my God, there's letters! Actual handwritten letters tied with ribbon, and they're talking about... [slowly] the Underground Railroad. This building was a station. [pause] We've been—I've been walking through history this whole time, you know? Just doing my regular maintenance and never knowing. [anxious] I need to call someone, but who? The historical society? The owner's gonna flip when they find out. [laugh] Actually no, they'll be thrilled—this changes everything. We're not just some old building anymore. [overwhelmed] I mean, landmark status means no more renovations without approval, no more quick fixes. [sigh] Everything I do here is gonna be different now. But honestly? [warm] These people risked everything to help others escape. They hid them right here, where I'm standing. [very quietly] And I'm the one who found their story. After 160 years in the dark, I—a maintenance guy just trying to fix a leak—I brought them back into the light. [emotional] That's... that's something, isn't it?
