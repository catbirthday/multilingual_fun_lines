Subject: Your younger sibling just got into the same graduate program that rejected you twice

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] Mom just called. Sarah got in. [pause] To Columbia. The same Columbia that sent me two rejection letters that I still have in my desk drawer for some masochistic reason. [sarcastic] And of course she got a full scholarship too. [sigh] I mean, I'm happy for her. [hesitantly] I am. She worked hard, she deserves it, she's brilliant, all of that. [frustrated] But God, it's just— I had the same GPA. Better recommendations, actually. Three years of research experience to her one. [trailing off] And they didn't even waitlist me... [long pause] The worst part is everyone's going to call me now. [mocking] "Did you hear about Sarah? Isn't it wonderful?" [upset] Yeah, it's wonderful. It's wonderful that my baby sister is doing what I couldn't. [shaky voice] And I'll have to smile at her graduation party and tell her how proud I am while everyone's thinking about how I failed. Twice. [quietly] Maybe I just wasn't good enough. [pause] Maybe that's, um... maybe that's what I need to accept. [bitter] She has something I don't. Whatever that mysterious thing admissions committees see. [sigh] I should call her. [regretful] Congratulate her before this feeling gets worse and I say something I can't take back.
