Yeah, well, they're cutting that entire sequence.\" Just like that. \n\n[pause] \n\nAnd honestly, the thing is—I turned down two other projects for this. You know? Because this was supposed to be it. [frustrated] This was the one that would get my name out there, like, finally. My parents keep asking, \"So when can we see your movie?\" and I'm just—[laugh] what do I even tell them? \n\nI keep thinking maybe if I'd done something different with the color palette, or, I don't know, worked faster on the revisions—[trailing off] but that's stupid. The director loved them. Er, he literally said they were \"breathtaking.\" [sarcastic] Breathtaking enough to delete, apparently.\n\n[sigh]\n\nAnd here's the thing—I still have to pay rent next month. So, um, I guess I'll just... start over? Send my portfolio around again like I'm fresh out of school? [very melancholic] God, I really thought this was it. I mean, everyone said the film was going to be huge. [whispering] I already updated my LinkedIn."
