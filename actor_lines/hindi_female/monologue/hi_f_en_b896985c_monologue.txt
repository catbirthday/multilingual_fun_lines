Speaker [en]: They actually did it. They actually—oh my God, [gasp softly] the bonus came through for everyone. I mean, I knew the efficiency numbers were good, but like... thirty percent improvement in throughput? That's, um, that's not nothing. [excited] And Marissa just told me the whole bindery team is getting the quarterly bonus because of it!

The thing is, I honestly didn't even—[short pause] well, okay, I guess I did work pretty hard on reorganizing the workflow stations. But you know, it was just so obvious once I started tracking where the bottlenecks were happening. [animated] Like, why were we moving completed stacks three times before shipping? That's just—anyway, er, I streamlined all that.

[nervous] What if they think I'm showing off though? I mean, Carlos has been there for fifteen years and here I come with my—no, actually, [relieved] Carlos was the first one to congratulate me. He said, uh, he said he'd been wanting someone to fix that system for ages.

[very sincerely] It feels really good, you know? Not just the money—though obviously that's amazing—but like, everyone benefits. The whole team. [smiling speaking] We're going out for drinks Friday to celebrate, and honestly? I kind of can't wait to buy the first round.
