[very quickly] Jenkins versus Memorial Hospital, 2019, almost the exact same circumstances—denied coverage, pre-existing condition clause, everything. [laughs] I can't believe I actually found it. [shaky voice] Four months of searching through medical malpractice cases and it was filed under insurance bad faith the whole time. [passionately] The judge ruled that when a child's life is at stake, the insurance company can't just hide behind technicalities. [pause] They won. [very quietly] They actually won. [crying while speaking] God, the Martinez family, they've been through so much already, and their little girl... she's only seven. [sniffle] This is going to change everything for them. [relieved] I mean, we still have to present it right, but this precedent, it's... it's literally identical to their situation. [excited] The insurance company used the same exact language in their denial letter! [emotional] I need to call David right now, he's not going to believe this. [laughs] Actually, wait, I should probably, um... I should double-check the appeals court first, make sure it wasn't overturned. [confidently] But no, this is solid. [extremely happy] We're going to win this. [whispered] We're actually going to win this for them."
