Look at these markers. Perfect alignment across all loci. This is, um... this is ironclad. [excited] The new extraction protocol worked!

William Harper, 34, construction worker from Riverside. That's who killed the Brennan girl. [very sincerely] Mia Brennan would've been thirty-two this year. Same age as my daughter.
