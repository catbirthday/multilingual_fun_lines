[pause] I keep staring at it like it's gonna, um, tell me something I don't already know. [bitter] Twenty years of climbing towers, rigging stages, hanging off buildings—and for what? [sigh] The money was good, I mean, really good when you're working those high-risk jobs. [regretful] But I was never here. Always in Dubai, or Hong Kong, or... [trailing off] wherever the next impossible job was. [frustrated] She used to say \"be careful\" every morning, and I'd just—I'd laugh it off, you know? [very sad] Like it was nothing. [long pause] The Petronas Towers gig, that storm in Seattle, the scaffolding collapse in Miami... [shaky voice] I almost died three times last year alone. Three times. [cry] And she was here, just... waiting. [whispering] Always waiting for that phone call. [upset] I chose the adrenaline over breakfast together. [very slowly] Chose the crew over family dinners. [crying while speaking] God, when did I become the guy who misses every anniversary because there's a concert rig in Tokyo? [sniffle] The ring's still sitting there. [very quietly] Right where she left it."
