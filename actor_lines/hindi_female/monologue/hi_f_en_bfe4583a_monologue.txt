=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [very quietly] Six months. Um, six months of my life just... gone. I mean, they called me yesterday and basically said—[bitter] "Hey, remember those thirty-seven matte paintings you did? Yeah, well, they're cutting that entire sequence." Just like that. 

[pause] 

And honestly, the thing is—I turned down two other projects for this. You know? Because this was supposed to be it. [frustrated] This was the one that would get my name out there, like, finally. My parents keep asking, "So when can we see your movie?" and I'm just—[laugh] what do I even tell them? 

I keep thinking maybe if I'd done something different with the color palette, or, I don't know, worked faster on the revisions—[trailing off] but that's stupid. The director loved them. Er, he literally said they were "breathtaking." [sarcastic] Breathtaking enough to delete, apparently.

[sigh]

And here's the thing—I still have to pay rent next month. So, um, I guess I'll just... start over? Send my portfolio around again like I'm fresh out of school? [very melancholic] God, I really thought this was it. I mean, everyone said the film was going to be huge. [whispering] I already updated my LinkedIn.
