You know, um, when I was painting those clouds behind the cemetery scene, I mean, [slowly] I must've repainted that sky like forty times. [laugh] Seriously, forty! The director kept saying it needed to feel more, er, \"emotionally weighted,\" whatever that meant. [pause] But then I thought, well, what if the clouds kind of mirror what she's feeling? Like, [passionately] not just background, but actually part of her grief, you know? \n\n[warm] So I started adding these really subtle color shifts—basically, purples bleeding into grays, and then, [whispering] just the tiniest hint of gold where the light breaks through. [gasp softly] And honestly, when I saw it on screen with the actors, I just... [crying while speaking] I didn't expect to feel so much, you know? Here's the thing—I've painted hundreds of backgrounds, but this one, [very sincerely] this one actually made people cry. My mom called me sobbing about that scene! [laugh loudly] Can you believe that? \n\n[relieved] All those years studying classic paintings, and it turns out, um, they actually prepared me for this exact moment. [sigh] I guess backgrounds aren't so invisible after all."
