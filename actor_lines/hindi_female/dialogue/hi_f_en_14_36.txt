Character 1 [en]: I've been looking at [very melancholic] these car prices and they're just insane now.

Character 2 [en]: The numbers are definitely wild—a basic sedan starts at thirty-two thousand now, but here's the thing, we can work with monthly payments that make it feel less painful, maybe four-fifty a month?

Character 1 [en]: Four-fifty sounds manageable.

Character 2 [en]: Well, that's with, you know, zero down and uhh, a seven-year term at, I mean, eight-point-nine percent APR—the total comes to thirty-seven thousand eight hundred, but honestly, who's counting when you're driving off the lot today?

Character 1 [en]: Wait, that's almost six thousand more than the sticker price.

Character 2 [en]: Interest adds up, but think about it this way—that's only twenty-three dollars extra per month compared to the base price, and you get to keep your savings intact for emergencies or investments.

Character 1 [en]: What about that certified pre-owned one for twenty-eight thousand?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, the twenty-sixteen with, um, seventy-two thousand miles? [mocking] That's actually, you know, priced at twenty-nine nine after the er, certification fee, and honestly, the warranty only covers powertrain for another twelve months.

Character 1 [en]: Twelve months isn't much coverage.

Character 2 [en]: For an extra three thousand nine hundred, we can extend that warranty to sixty months bumper-to-bumper, which brings your total to thirty-three nine—might as well get the new one at that point, right?

Character 1 [en]: These numbers are making my head spin.

Character 2 [en]: Let me simplify—new car at thirty-two, you're looking at five hundred twelve monthly with our best rate at five-point-nine percent if you put down four thousand today.

Character 1 [en]: Four thousand down? Um, you just said, like, zero down was possible, I mean, a minute ago.

Character 2 [en]: Zero down is absolutely possible, just changes the math—your payment jumps to six twenty-eight monthly, but hey, keeping cash liquid in this economy might be worth that extra hundred sixteen per month.

Character 1 [en]: What's the actual bottom line price you can do?

Character 2 [en]: I can, well, go to thirty-one two if you, uhh, finance through us, but here's the thing, that's eating into the eight hundred dealer cash that's already, you know, baked into the advertised price.

Character 1 [en]: Eight hundred was already included in the thirty-two thousand?

Character 2 [en]: The thirty-two is after manufacturer rebates of [shouting] twenty-two hundred, so technically the MSRP is thirty-four two, but we're playing with about fourteen hundred in wiggle room here!

Character 1 [en]: So actually, the real price is, um, thirty-four thousand two hundred, er, before any, like, discounts at all?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly, but honestly, between trade-in value, so, let's say six thousand for your current car, and uhh, our financing incentives, you know, your out-of-pocket could be as low as twenty-five eight—numbers are just tools to get you driving.
