Character 1 [en]: Hey, are you the one calling out the performance order? I'm trying to find my daughter's group.

Character 2 [en]: That's me! I've got the whole lineup right here. What's your daughter's studio name? We've got about fifty groups performing today, so it's quite the production.

Character 1 [en]: [cry loudly] It's Elite Motion Academy! She's been practicing for months!

Character 2 [en]: Elite Motion Academy is number twenty-seven. They're in the junior contemporary category, performing right after lunch break. Your daughter picked a great studio—they always bring something special to the stage.

Character 1 [en]: Number twenty-seven, got it. How long have you been doing this?

Character 2 [en]: This is my eighth year as festival publicist. Next up is number fourteen, Broadway Bound Studios! They're doing a tap routine to classic Sinatra, should be fantastic.

Character 1 [en]: Eight years of reading numbers must get repetitive.

Character 2 [en]: You'd think so, but every performance has its own energy. Number fifteen, Twinkle Toes Academy, you're on deck! These kids put their hearts into every move, and I get to be part of that magic.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Do you ever mix up the numbers? That seems like it would be my nightmare.

Character 2 [en]: Once I called number sixty instead of sixteen and caused total chaos backstage. Now I triple-check everything and use both the number and studio name. Speaking of which, number sixteen, Rising Stars Dance Company!

Character 1 [en]: The parents must get pretty intense about the order.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Some parents treat this like the Olympics. But most are just proud and nervous, wanting their kids to shine. Number seventeen, Pirouette Palace, please head to staging!

Character 1 [en]: My daughter keeps asking if they might move her group earlier.

Character 2 [en]: The schedule is pretty set unless there's an emergency. We plan the order months in advance to balance different styles and age groups. Keeps the energy flowing for the audience.

Character 1 [en]: Makes sense. Oh, that last group was incredible!

Character 2 [en]: [laugh histerically] That was Rhythm Revolution, they always bring down the house! Number eighteen, Footlight Dreams Academy, you're up next! Their instructor used to perform on Broadway, brings that professional polish to everything.

Character 1 [en]: How many more until twenty-seven?

Character 2 [en]: [happy] Just nine more groups, so about forty-five minutes! Your daughter will have plenty of time to warm up. The contemporary routines after lunch are always my favorite part of the day.

Character 1 [en]: You really love this job, don't you?

Character 2 [en]: [child-like] Every single second of it! Number nineteen, Tiny Tappers Studio, head to staging please! Where else would I get paid to watch kids discover they can fly?
