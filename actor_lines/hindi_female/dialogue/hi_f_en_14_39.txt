Character 1 [en]: Um, I just found out my nephew, you know, [gasp loudly] lost his leg in the accident and he's, well, really struggling.

Character 2 [en]: Oh gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that—how old is he, and um, what kind of activities did he enjoy before? I mean, there are actually incredible adaptive sports programs that might really help him through this transition.

Character 1 [en]: He's fifteen and played basketball constantly.

Character 2 [en]: That's actually, you know, [confidently] perfect timing because wheelchair basketball is one of the most developed adaptive sports out there—has anyone, er, mentioned the Junior Paralympic programs to your family yet?

Character 1 [en]: Nobody's mentioned anything like that to us.

Character 2 [en]: Really? Okay so, let me tell you about this program I volunteer with—we basically match kids with mentors who've been through similar experiences, and honestly, watching them discover what they're still capable of is just incredible.

Character 1 [en]: But like, he won't even, I guess, leave his room right now—how do we, um, even start?

Character 2 [en]: That's completely normal, and here's the thing, we usually start with virtual meetings first—would he maybe be open to just, uh, watching some Paralympic highlights or talking to another teen who's been where he is?

Character 1 [en]: I mean, maybe? He's pretty, err, angry about everything, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Anger is actually a healthy [exhausted] part of processing this—my friend Marcus lost his leg at seventeen and said being furious was what eventually pushed him to prove everyone wrong about what he could do.

Character 1 [en]: So, wait, your friend, umm, [confused] he plays sports now? Like, actually, competitively?

Character 2 [en]: Marcus just qualified for the national, uh, track and field team—he runs the hundred meters faster now than he did before his accident, which kind of blows people's minds when they hear it.

Character 1 [en]: That's, I mean, how is that even, like, possible though?

Character 2 [en]: The technology in prosthetics has advanced incredibly—but more importantly, would your nephew want to meet Marcus? He loves talking to kids who are just starting their adaptive sports journey.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, that might, you know, be exactly what he needs right now.

Character 2 [en]: What city are you in, because there's [curious] this amazing adaptive sports expo coming up where kids can, er, try everything from rock climbing to surfing—would your family maybe want to attend together?

Character 1 [en]: We're in Denver, actually.

Character 2 [en]: Denver has one of the best, hmm, adaptive sports communities in the country! The National Sports Center for the Disabled is right there—have you heard about their, basically, free equipment loan program?

Character 1 [en]: Um, no, we haven't heard about, like, [bored] any of this stuff—the hospital just, well, sent us home.

Character 2 [en]: That's unfortunately really common, but listen, I'm going to, uh, send you all the contact information—the thing is, once your nephew connects with other kids going through this, everything changes, honestly.
