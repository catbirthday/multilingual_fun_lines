Character 1 [en]: So we're all here to discuss the mystery novel situation. Dad, you want to start?

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I just think it's, [very sad], you know, become this obsession that's honestly taking over our entire household dynamic.

Character 1 [en]: That's a bit dramatic, I mean, Mom just likes reading, er, and collecting them, right?

Character 2 [en]: It's not just reading anymore, though—like, she's spending hundreds of dollars monthly, and, uhh, the spare room is basically a library now, completely unusable.

Character 1 [en]: Mom, uh, what do you, [frustrated], I guess, have to say about this? It's kind of your thing we're discussing here.

Character 2 [en]: So, mysteries give me something that, hmm, this family doesn't—they have resolution, the thing is, everything gets solved and makes sense by the end.

Character 1 [en]: Ouch. That feels pointed. Are you saying we don't make sense?

Character 2 [en]: I'm saying that in an Agatha Christie novel, when someone's upset, there's always a clear reason, not just vague disappointment hanging in the air constantly.

Character 1 [en]: Dad, you look like you want to say something.

Character 2 [en]: Actually, your mother has a point, [sad], er, about needing escape—I mean, we've all been pretty checked out lately, not just her.

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, we're all, [slowly], uhh, admitting that basically we use different things to avoid dealing with each other?

Character 2 [en]: That's exactly it, and, well, at least mystery novels don't involve, you know, gambling or drinking—it's honestly a pretty harmless coping mechanism comparatively.

Character 1 [en]: Harmless? The credit card bills suggest otherwise. Three hundred dollars last month at the bookstore.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, you've been checking [gasp softly] my personal statements? That's a violation of trust and privacy that we specifically agreed you wouldn't do anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Someone has to be the adult here and manage our finances.

Character 2 [en]: Oh great, so, the twenty-three-year-old, [groan], er, is lecturing us about being adults—anyway, maybe focus on your own life instead of micromanaging ours.

Character 1 [en]: This is exactly why these sessions never work. Everyone just gets defensive.

Character 2 [en]: You're right, and maybe that's because [sneeze] we're treating symptoms instead of addressing the real issue—we don't actually enjoy being around each other anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Jesus, Mom. That's [laugh] really dark, even for you.

Character 2 [en]: It's not dark, it's [very melancholic] just honest—and maybe if we read more mysteries together instead of separately, we'd find our way back to each other.
