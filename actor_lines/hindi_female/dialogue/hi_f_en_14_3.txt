Character 1 [en]: I've been wanting to learn to paint but I have zero artistic talent.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, stop right there! Nobody starts with talent—everyone starts with curiosity and a willingness to make terrible art. The best artists I know made absolute garbage for years before they got good.

Character 1 [en]: That's easy [empathetically] for you to say when you're not the one making the garbage.

Character 2 [en]: Ha! You should, um, see my first paintings—they looked like, you know, a toddler got into the finger paints. But here's the thing is, every bad painting teaches you something the good ones never could.

Character 1 [en]: Like what, er, exactly? How to, I mean, waste paint and canvas?

Character 2 [en]: No no, like how colors actually, hmm, mix versus how you think they'll mix, or how, well, much water changes everything. Your mistakes become your teachers if you pay attention instead of judging yourself.

Character 1 [en]: But what if I'm genuinely bad at it?

Character 2 [en]: Then you'll be bad at something that brings you joy! How many things do we do perfectly that make us miserable? I'd rather paint badly and feel alive than excel at something that numbs me.

Character 1 [en]: That's a bit [condescending] naive, honestly, don't you, um, think?

Character 2 [en]: Maybe, but I've, er, watched too many people wait for "readiness" that never comes, you know? They die with their paintbrushes still in the package, their canvases pristine and useless.

Character 1 [en]: Okay but, like, supplies are expensive and I don't, uh, even know what to buy.

Character 2 [en]: Start with kids' tempera paint from the dollar store and cardboard if you have to. Seriously! Some of my favorite pieces came from experimenting with "wrong" materials because I couldn't afford the "right" ones.

Character 1 [en]: You painted on cardboard?

Character 2 [en]: Cardboard, newspaper, old wooden boards, even fabric scraps! Art doesn't care about your budget—it cares about your willingness to play and explore without needing permission.

Character 1 [en]: I guess I'm, well, just scared of looking, you know, foolish.

Character 2 [en]: Good! That means you're about to do something that matters to you. The only people who never look foolish are the ones who never try anything new or vulnerable.

Character 1 [en]: What if, um, people see my work and, like, laugh?

Character 2 [en]: Then you'll know they're not your people. The ones worth keeping around will celebrate your courage to create, not mock your beginner's attempts at finding your voice.

Character 1 [en]: You make it sound so simple.

Character 2 [en]: It's not simple, but it's, actually, simpler than you think—you literally just, er, pick up a brush and make a mark. Then another. The hardest part is believing you're allowed to begin.
