Character 1 [en]: So, um, are you telling me this VIP package is, you know, worth twelve thousand dollars?

Character 2 [en]: So, when Spotify launched their Premium tier, they actually discovered that exclusive experiences drive more revenue than the core product—this backstage meet-and-greet plus studio session creates what Marc Andreessen calls "experience moat" around our brand.

Character 1 [en]: But, err, how does meeting the band for five minutes, I guess, justify that price point?

Character 2 [en]: Well, it's not just five minutes—you're getting honestly two hours of studio access where Paul McCartney recorded "Band on the Run," plus dinner at the same table where Beyoncé signed her Parkwood Entertainment deals, creating what we call aspirational proximity value.

Character 1 [en]: Uhh, you're saying I'd be sitting [deep pitch] where Beyoncé sat? That's basically the entire pitch?

Character 2 [en]: The psychological principle here is what Brian Chesky from Airbnb calls "belonging anywhere"—you're not buying a seat, you're buying entry into a narrative that includes music royalty, which transforms you from consumer to participant in cultural history.

Character 1 [en]: Does anyone actually buy these packages?

Character 2 [en]: Tesla's Founders Series, hmm, proved that super-premium tiers can kind of represent forty percent of profit margin despite being less than two percent of unit sales—our data shows similar patterns with these experiences.

Character 1 [en]: Like, what happens if, I mean, the artist cancels?

Character 2 [en]: That's why we structure it, uh, like how Netflix handles content availability—anyway, you get credits worth one-point-five times the value, plus guaranteed rebooking priority, turning potential disappointment into future engagement opportunity.

Character 1 [en]: Who came up with this model?

Character 2 [en]: Our head of experience [quickly] design worked at Disney Imagineering, then helped MasterClass develop their pricing strategy—she basically applied what Clayton Christensen called "jobs to be done" framework to identify that people hire VIP experiences for identity construction, not entertainment.

Character 1 [en]: Identity construction? That sounds made up.

Character 2 [en]: Right so, when Supreme drops a limited edition, the thing is they're selling belonging to an in-group—Harvard Business School documented this phenomenon showing luxury experiences create stronger brand loyalty than luxury products by about thirty-seven percent.

Character 1 [en]: So you're sort of comparing this to, well, [whispering loudly] Supreme drops? That's your benchmark?

Character 2 [en]: Look, Coachella VIP [bored] packages run twenty thousand dollars and sell out in minutes because, as Seth Godin writes, people pay premium prices for stories they can tell about themselves—we're just productizing that same human need.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, how many of these have you, err, sold so far?

Character 2 [en]: We've moved eighty-seven packages [loudly] this quarter alone, beating what Eventbrite's data suggested for our market size—turns out their product-market fit analysis underestimated how much people value curated exclusivity in live experiences.

Character 1 [en]: Eighty-seven people paid twelve grand for this?

Character 2 [en]: Y Combinator teaches that product-market fit means people buying something you're embarrassed to charge for—we tripled our initial price after the first weekend sold out in six hours, and demand actually increased rather than decreased.
