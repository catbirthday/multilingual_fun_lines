Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] So this is the property you mentioned? The one with the partnership potential?

Character 2 [en]: Yes, exactly! This building generates about 2.3 million in annual revenue across its twelve units, and what's really exciting is that three of our current alliance partners are already interested in co-investing.

Character 1 [en]: 2.3 million? That's higher than the initial estimates.

Character 2 [en]: The numbers have been consistently climbing for the past eighteen months. We're seeing roughly 8% year-over-year growth, and with the new tech corridor opening nearby, we could realistically hit 2.8 million within two years.

Character 1 [en]: What about the occupancy rates?

Character 2 [en]: [laugh histerically] You're going to love this—we're at 97% occupancy! The only vacant unit is being renovated right now, and we already have four applications lined up for it at $3,200 per month.

Character 1 [en]: Four applications already? That's incredible market demand.

Character 2 [en]: The location is unbeatable. Average rent in this neighborhood is $2,850, but we're commanding a 12% premium because of the building's amenities and our property management reputation.

Character 1 [en]: How much are we talking for initial investment?

Character 2 [en]: The total acquisition cost is 18.5 million, but here's where it gets interesting—we only need to put up 4.6 million because I've already secured commitments from two alliance partners for the remaining 13.9 million.

Character 1 [en]: You've already lined up that much funding?

Character 2 [en]: My relationships in this market run deep. These partners trust our track record—we've delivered an average 14% ROI on our last six joint ventures over the past three years.

Character 1 [en]: 14% is impressive. What about operating expenses?

Character 2 [en]: Annual operating costs run about $420,000, which includes property management, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. That puts our net operating income at approximately 1.88 million, giving us a very healthy cap rate of 10.2%.

Character 1 [en]: That cap rate is fantastic for this area.

Character 2 [en]: [gasp] Oh, I almost forgot the best part—the seller is offering a 2% discount if we close within thirty days, which would save us $370,000 right off the top!

Character 1 [en]: $370,000 savings? Why the rush to sell?

Character 2 [en]: They're restructuring their portfolio to focus on industrial properties. Their timeline pressure is our opportunity—plus with our alliance partners ready to move, we can absolutely hit that thirty-day target.

Character 1 [en]: What's the projected timeline for seeing returns?

Character 2 [en]: Based on current cash flow, investors will see distributions starting in month two, with full return of initial investment projected within 5.8 years. After that, it's pure profit—roughly $285,000 annually per million invested.
