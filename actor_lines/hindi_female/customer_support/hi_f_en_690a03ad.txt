=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi. I'm calling about... what's the word... a supply order? It's not... not right.

Customer Support [en]: Good afternoon! Let me—let me pull up your account here. Do you happen to have your, um, your order number? It would start with ORD dash and then some numbers.

Customer [en]: How do I know you're... um... actually gonna help? Last time they just... kept transferring me.

Customer Support [en]: Oh I completely understand that frustration! So here's what I can do. I can—I can look you up by your practice name. And then we'll get this sorted. Right away. What's the name of your orthodontic office?

Customer [en]: Bright Smiles. But um... they said... what if you just tell me the same thing?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect perfect! Bright Smiles Orthodontics. I've got you. Right here. Account number ACC-45791-B. So I can see, um, let me just... okay so there's an order from Tuesday? ORD-8823-QV91?

Customer [en]: That's it. But it's... it's all wrong. Like completely.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay. Tell me—tell me what's happening with it. I'm looking at the... what's the... the manifest here and I can see you ordered, um, orthodontic brackets and some elastics?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah but... sorry, I just... I need someone who can actually fix this.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! And that's—that's exactly what we're gonna do. Right now. Together. So it looks like, hmm, the shipment shows delivered but you're saying the items are wrong?

Customer [en]: They sent us... um... dental floss. Cases of it. How does that even... happen?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Oh oh oh I see—I see what happened! This is, um, this is actually... let me check the warehouse code. WH-7739. Yeah. Classic mix-up. Someone grabbed from the wrong bin.

Customer [en]: So um... sorry but... should I talk to... to a supervisor? I don't mean to be...

Customer Support [en]: No no no, you don't need to—to apologize at all! This is a big deal. But here's the thing. I can—I can actually fix this faster than a supervisor could. Priority reshipment. Today.

Customer [en]: Really? You're not just... saying that?

Customer Support [en]: I'm initiating it. Right. Now. New order number ORD-8829-QV92. And I'm—I'm marking it as, um, what we call... critical medical supplies. That means overnight. No charge.

Customer [en]: Um, I'm sorry I was so... I just thought you were gonna... you know.

Customer Support [en]: Hey hey, don't even—don't even worry about it! You need those brackets for patients. Tomorrow. I get it. So your tracking number, um, it's gonna be TRK-99428-XPRS. You'll get an email in about, hmm, five minutes?

Customer [en]: That's... wow. Um, thank you. Really. Sorry again.

Customer Support [en]: You're—you're totally fine! And actually? I'm adding a credit. CRD-1187-APL. For the hassle. Fifty dollars off your next order. Because nobody—nobody should get dental floss when they need brackets!
