=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [mix]: Hi, I'm calling about my bill and I'm—नहीं रुको, मुझे ढूंढने दो—कहीं यहीं पास में है...

Customer Support [mix]: No rush at all. अपना टाइम लीजिए। Account ending in देख रही हूं...

Customer [mix]: It's 4487. मेरी पोती usually मेरी मदद करती है इन चीज़ों में लेकिन वो अभी college गई हुई है और मैं बस...

Customer Support [mix]: Got it, 4487. November का statement निकाल रही हूं। Total $187.43 दिख रहा है। तीन charges हैं यहां। Internet base। Equipment rental। और...

Customer [mix]: That's what I don't understand, क्योंकि पिछले महीने तो सिर्फ ninety-something था और मैंने कुछ change नहीं किया, कम से कम मुझे तो नहीं लगता...

Customer Support [mix]: Right right, October was $92.11. काफी बड़ा jump है। मैं और गहराई से देखती हूं। Account ID BWX-7701-M में October 22 को service upgrade दिख रहा है। Speed boost package। Extra $45 monthly।

Customer [mix]: I don't remember ordering that at all. शायद मैंने कुछ गलत click कर दिया हो? मैं computer वगैरह में बहुत अच्छी नहीं हूं और कभी-कभी...

Customer Support [mix]: Happens more than you'd think actually. System logs में दिख रहा है कि upgrade automated phone prompt से हुआ था 3:47 PM पर। कभी-कभी वो menus...

Customer [mix]: Oh no, that might've been me then. मैं phone से pay करने की कोशिश कर रही थी और इतने सारे options आते रहे और मैंने बस—मैंने ज़रूर गलत button दबा दिया होगा, है ना?

Customer Support [mix]: Easy mistake, really easy. वो prompts सच में confusing होते हैं। मेरी अपनी माँ। पिछले महीने बिल्कुल यही चीज़ हुई। मुझे phone किया cable bill के $80 बढ़ने पर पूरी परेशान होकर।

Customer [mix]: It's so embarrassing though. मेरे बच्चे पहले से ही सोचते हैं कि मैं अब अकेले चीज़ें handle नहीं कर सकती और अब ये...

Customer Support [mix]: Nothing embarrassing about it, seriously. मैं तो दिन में करीब 15 ऐसे cases process करती हूं। अच्छी बात ये है—मैं इसे reverse कर सकती हूं। October और November का पूरा overage credit। मतलब $94.64 वापस।

Customer [mix]: Really, you can do that? क्योंकि मैं fixed income पर हूं और हर dollar सच में matter करता है इन दिनों...

Customer Support [mix]: Already processing it now. Confirmation number RFD-2847-XK है। 3-5 business days में credit दिख जाना चाहिए। एक note भी डाल रही हूं। कोई भी service change बिना live representative से बात किये नहीं होगा।

Customer [mix]: Oh that would be wonderful honestly. मैं बस—आप sure हैं ना कि इससे कोई problem नहीं होगी? मैं नहीं चाहती कि किसी को trouble हो...

Customer Support [mix]: Standard reversal, nothing unusual at all. और आपका base rate भी कम कर रही हूं। Senior discount के लिए qualify कर रही हैं आप। पहले apply नहीं था। Extra $15 off monthly अब से।

Customer [mix]: I didn't even know there was a senior discount. आपने मेरे साथ इतना patience रखा, thank you so much...

Customer Support [mix]: That's what I'm here for, really. December से आपका नया monthly total $77.11 होगा। अभी confirmation email भेज रही हूं। Reference number SEN-DISC-9901।

Customer [mix]: Seventy-seven dollars only? वो तो पहले से भी कम है! मुझे शायद ये सब लिख लेना चाहिए ना...

Customer Support [mix]: Email has everything you need. PDF attachment भी है। उसका print out निकाल लीजिए। पास में रखिये। अम्म। एक और बात। अगली बार जब help चाहिए हो? Direct line 888-555-0122। सारा automated stuff skip हो जाएगा।

Customer: Hi, I'm calling about my bill and I'm—no wait, let me find it—I have it right here somewhere...

Customer Support: No rush. Take your time. Looking at account ending in...

Customer: It's 4487. My granddaughter usually helps me with these things but she's away at college now and I just...

Customer Support: Got it. 4487. Pulling up November's statement. Total shows $187.43. Three charges here. Internet base. Equipment rental. And...

Customer: That's what I don't understand because last month it was only ninety-something and I haven't changed anything, at least I don't think...

Customer Support: Right right. October was $92.11. Big jump. Let me dig deeper. Account ID BWX-7701-M shows a service upgrade on October 22nd. Speed boost package. Extra $45 monthly.

Customer: I don't remember ordering that. Maybe I clicked something wrong? I'm not very good with the computer stuff and sometimes...

Customer Support: Happens more than you'd think. System logs show the upgrade was initiated through automated phone prompt at 3:47 PM. Sometimes those menus...

Customer: Oh no, that might've been me. I was trying to pay by phone and all these options kept coming up and I just—I probably pressed the wrong button didn't I?

Customer Support: Easy mistake. Those prompts are confusing. My own mother. Same exact thing last month. Called me completely flustered about her cable bill jumping $80.

Customer: It's so embarrassing. My kids already think I can't handle things on my own anymore and now this...

Customer Support: Nothing embarrassing about it. Seriously. I process maybe 15 of these a day. Good news though. Can reverse this. Full credit for October and November overage. That's $94.64 back to you.

Customer: Really? You can do that? Because I'm on a fixed income and every dollar really does matter these days...

Customer Support: Already processing. Confirmation number RFD-2847-XK. Should see the credit within 3-5 business days. Also putting a note. No service changes without speaking to live representative first.

Customer: Oh that would be wonderful. I just—are you sure this won't cause problems? I don't want anyone getting in trouble...

Customer Support: Standard reversal. Nothing unusual. Also lowering your base rate. Qualifying for senior discount. Wasn't applied before. Extra $15 off monthly going forward.

Customer: I didn't even know there was a senior discount. Thank you so much, you've been so patient with me...

Customer Support: That's what I'm here for. New monthly total will be $77.11 starting December. Sending confirmation email now. Reference number SEN-DISC-9901.

Customer: Seventy-seven? That's even less than before! I should probably write all this down shouldn't I...

Customer Support: Email has everything. PDF attachment too. Print that out. Keep it handy. Um. One more thing. Next time you need help? Direct line 888-555-0122. Skips all the automated stuff.
