=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I just... I can't. I can't do this anymore. Yesterday's call was—no wait—it was so bad.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Um, I think—let me pull up your account. What's your—actually, can I get your phone number first?

Customer [en]: Five five five. Pause. Eight two seven. Pause. Nine one one four.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, thank you. So I see account ACC-9982-TK here and... oh. Oh dear. I'm really, really sorry. There's notes about yesterday.

Customer [en]: Notes? What kind of—I don't even—just tell me.

Customer Support [en]: Well it says here the call dropped? Three times? And reference REF-2024-8847 shows... nobody called you back? That's not—I mean, that shouldn't happen.

Customer [en]: Three times. Three. And then nothing. I just sat there.

Customer Support [en]: I'm so, so sorry about that. Really. Let me—I think I can probably help fix whatever the original issue was? What were you calling about?

Customer [en]: My bill. Double charged. For months apparently. I can't—no actually—I'm just exhausted.

Customer Support [en]: Double charged for months? That's... that's weird actually. Let me look at billing code BIL-4429-XX. Hmm. Oh. Oh this is interesting.

Customer [en]: Interesting? Is that—what does that—never mind.

Customer Support [en]: No no, it's good! Well, sort of. I mean—I can see the problem now. Transaction TRX-7765-MN keeps duplicating. System glitch maybe?

Customer [en]: So you can fix it? Actually fix it? Not just... disconnect?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. Yes. I'm applying credit code CRD-9901-LP right now. Should cover... wow. Four months of overcharges. I'm really sorry.

Customer [en]: Four months. I knew it. Okay. Okay that's... something at least.

Customer Support [en]: Credit's processing. Should hit your account in twenty-four hours. Reference number is REF-2024-8849. And I'm adding priority flag PRI-GOLD so you skip the queue next time.

Customer [en]: Next time. Right. Because there's always a next time with you guys.

Customer Support [en]: I know. I get it. Really. But that priority code? It routes straight to senior reps. No more drops. I promise.

Customer [en]: That's... actually helpful. Thank you. Really. I'm just hoping this sticks.

Customer Support [en]: It will. Confirmation CON-5547-RZ is in your email now. And hey—I'm genuinely sorry about yesterday. That wasn't okay.
