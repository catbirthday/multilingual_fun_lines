=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I just... I need to, uh... the vanilla extract charges? They're... what's the word... inconsistent?

Customer Support [en]: Oh I hear you, I really do. Let me... hmm... pull up your account VND-4521-BC here and... yeah, I see what you mean about those charges.

Customer [en]: It's just, um, I'm so tired of... of calling about this.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I get it. Trust me, our billing system for... for ingredient suppliers is... let me find the right... it's frustrating for us too. Your account shows three different rates - $42.50, $38.00, and now $47.25 for the exact same SKU-88412-VE extract.

Customer [en]: Wait, um, forty... forty-seven? I thought you said, uh... thirty-eight?

Customer Support [en]: So, umm, yeah there's... there's actually three different charges here. Let me... hmm... okay so transaction TXN-9981542 shows thirty-eight, but the newest one from yesterday, that's... that's the forty-seven twenty-five.

Customer [en]: I don't... I don't understand how it's, um... how it keeps changing.

Customer Support [en]: Honestly? Neither do I sometimes. It's... the system uses this... what's the term... dynamic pricing model? But for a perfectionist like you, working with exact measurements, I can imagine how... how maddening this must be.

Customer [en]: Um, so like, can you just... I need one price. One... one consistent price.

Customer Support [en]: Right, right. I'm gonna... hmm... let me try to lock in a rate for you. Your supplier code SUP-7745-QX should qualify for... for fixed pricing. Been doing this five years and still... still fighting this system daily.

Customer [en]: Five years of... of this? God, I'm just... uh, I'm exhausted.

Customer Support [en]: Tell me about it. Some days I just... anyway. Let me submit request REQ-445821-FP for fixed pricing. Should take... hmm... forty-eight to seventy-two hours.

Customer [en]: Forty-eight to... wait, um, seventy... seventy-something hours?

Customer Support [en]: Umm, seventy-two. Three days. But, uh, between you and me? I'm gonna... gonna flag it priority. These vanilla extract orders under PO-8827-VAN, they're... they're time-sensitive for baking, right?

Customer [en]: Yeah, I just, um... everything has to be... be precise. The measurements, the... the costs, everything.

Customer Support [en]: I feel that. My mom's a baker, actually. One degree off, one gram wrong, whole thing's ruined. Let me add note NTE-55429 about... about precision requirements.

Customer [en]: So will this, uh... will this actually fix it? Or am I gonna... gonna call again next week?

Customer Support [en]: Um, honestly? The fixed rate under contract CTR-9945-B should... should stick. But I'm also gonna, uh, put you on my callback list. If it changes again, I'll... I'll personally handle it.

Customer [en]: Okay, I just... um, I can't keep doing this. Can't keep... keep calling.

Customer Support [en]: I know. I really... really do know. Your case number's CSE-78221-VE and, um, my direct extension's 4455. Sometimes the system wins but... but today we're gonna make this work. Promise.
