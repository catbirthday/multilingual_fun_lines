=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, so I'm, uh, I'm calling about my... my account. It's it's stuck in some kind of... what's the word... verification loop.

Customer Support [en]: Okay, so um, let me just pull that up for you here and, uh, I'll need to verify some information first if that's... Can I get your account number?

Customer [en]: Right. ACC-4... 4... wait, 48291-B.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I'm seeing that here, ACC-48291-B, and uh, let me just... hmm, okay so there's definitely something, um, unusual happening with the verification status here.

Customer [en]: Course there is. Look, I do this for students all day...

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so basically what's happening is, um, your account got flagged for, uh, let me see here... it's showing code VER-7739-X which is like a... what's the term... a recursive verification request?

Customer [en]: Yeah yeah yeah, I know what that... I mean, um, I file these forms constantly, just not for myself apparently...

Customer Support [en]: Oh you work in financial aid? That must be, um, really frustrating then, dealing with this on your own account when you know the system so well.

Customer [en]: It's... yeah. Can we just...

Customer Support [en]: Of course, of course, so um, what I'm going to do is, uh, I need to manually override this but, hmm, it requires a supervisor code, so let me just... Can you hold for just a moment while I grab that?

Customer [en]: Mm-hmm.

Customer Support [en]: Actually wait, um, before I do that, let me try something else here because, uh, sometimes if we resubmit with reference number REF-2024-88156, it can, you know, bypass the loop entirely.

Customer [en]: Um, that's... that's actually smart. We do that with, uh, with FAFSA corrections...

Customer Support [en]: So I'm submitting that now and, um, oh wow, it's actually... okay so it's processing, which is, uh, a good sign because before it was just instantly rejecting, you know?

Customer [en]: Wait, really? That that worked?

Customer Support [en]: Well, so, it's showing as pending now with confirmation PND-93847-K, which means it should clear in, um, let me check the timeline here... approximately 24 to 48 hours.

Customer [en]: That's... I mean, um, thank you. Really. I've been stuck on this for, uh, for three weeks.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, three weeks? I'm so sorry you've been dealing with this that long, but it should definitely be resolved now, and you'll get an email to the address we have on file once it completes.

Customer [en]: You actually fixed it. Like, um, properly fixed it. Not just... you know... passed it along.

Customer Support [en]: I'm really glad I could help! And hey, if for any reason it doesn't clear by Thursday, just reference case number CSE-48291-B-01 and any rep can check the status immediately for you, okay?
