=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I can't—someone's in my account and I just... I need help. Please.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, um, okay okay, let me just, uh... pull up the account recovery form here and we'll get this sorted, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, it's been such a busy morning but let's, um, let's focus on getting you back in.

Customer [en]: They changed everything. My password, my email... everything's gone.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so, um, I'm seeing here that we'll need to verify... uh, let me just... okay so first I need your original email address that was, um, associated with the account before all this happened?

Customer [en]: It was, um... sarah dot chen at... no wait, sorry, s chen 1987 at gmail.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, s chen 1987, and, uh, hmm, the system's being a bit... okay there we go, so I'm generating a case number for you, that's gonna be CSE-4492-NM88, and um, when did you first notice the unauthorized access?

Customer [en]: This morning I tried to—I couldn't log in and then... my whole business runs through there...

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely.

Customer [en]: Um, I have client files, invoices, I mean everything from the last five years is just...

Customer Support [en]: So, uh, I completely understand how critical this is, and um, let me just... okay so the recovery process, it's gonna require some verification steps here, I'm seeing your account ID is USR-88254-QV, and, uh, we'll need to confirm some details.

Customer [en]: Whatever you need. I just—please, I can't lose all that data, I really can't...

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: Do you know how long this takes? Because I have—tomorrow there's a huge presentation...

Customer Support [en]: So typically, um, the standard recovery is 24 to 48 hours but, uh, given your situation... hmm, let me see if I can... okay so there's an expedited process, reference code EXP-7731-BC, but I'll need to, um, verify three security questions first.

Customer [en]: I set those up so long ago, I don't even... what if I can't remember?

Customer Support [en]: It's okay, we have, um, backup verification methods if needed, so uh, first question here... what was the name of your first pet?

Customer [en]: Oh god, um... Whiskers? No wait—actually it was... Buddy. Definitely Buddy.

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, that's... uh, not quite matching what I have here, but let's try the next one, um, so what street did you grow up on?

Customer [en]: Look, I've been a premium member for eight years—can't you just... escalate this or something?

Customer Support [en]: I understand your frustration, I really do, but, um, for security reasons I can't bypass... uh, let me offer an alternative though, we can do identity verification through document upload, that's form IDV-9924-X, and that usually processes within 2-3 hours instead of the full 24.
