=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: *exhales* Hi, um, I'm calling about these charges? From my supplier account?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, okay... let me, uh, pull that up for you. Can I get your account number? It should start with SUP and then some numbers.

Customer [en]: Yeah it's, er, SUP-4827. I just—I know you guys deal with this all day.

Customer Support [en]: Mmm, no worries at all... *soft exhale* Alright, so I'm seeing your account here, SUP-4827-BK, and, um, there's quite a few transactions. Which charges specifically are you... I mean, what date range should I be looking at?

Customer [en]: Past week? Sorry. I'm probably missing something obvious.

Customer Support [en]: No no, you're fine, really... Okay so, hmm, I'm seeing seventeen different line items between December 2nd and December 9th. Most of them are, uh... they're kind of vaguely labeled. Like there's one here for $247.83 that just says "specialty ingredients batch."

Customer [en]: Right. Exactly. That's—*sharp inhale*—that could be anything.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, I can see why that's... *exhales* Look, I think the issue here is how our billing system categorizes things. These charges from supplier code VND-9901-A, they're legitimate but, er, the descriptions are basically useless, aren't they?

Customer [en]: Uh, yeah. I mean, I run a bakery. Need exact costs.

Customer Support [en]: Of course you do... *pause* Alright, what I'm gonna do—and this might take a minute—I'm going to cross-reference each charge with the actual purchase orders. So that $247.83, let me just... hmm, okay, that's showing as twelve kilos of Valrhona chocolate, invoice INV-20241203-K.

Customer [en]: Oh. Um, okay. That makes sense then. Sorry, this is so tedious for you.

Customer Support [en]: Honestly? It's kind of refreshing having someone who actually cares about the details... Most people just, uh, they just yell about the total. So this next one, $89.42, that's... *pause* ...twenty-four vanilla pods, grade A, from Madagascar. Order number ORD-8827-VP.

Customer [en]: See that's—that's what I need. Er, exactly that. Thank you.

Customer Support [en]: Mmm-hmm... You know what though? This is ridiculous that you have to call in for this. Let me, um... actually, hold on. I'm gonna try something here.

Customer [en]: I mean, like, whatever's easiest. Don't want to cause trouble.

Customer Support [en]: No no, this is... *soft sigh* Look, I'm setting up what we call detailed billing statements for your account. Going forward, every charge will show quantity, unit price, and product code. Should've been default for commercial accounts anyway, especially ones spending, uh, looks like $18,000 monthly.

Customer [en]: Wait, really? That's—*exhales*—that'd be amazing actually.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, it's... I mean, it's literally just checking a box on my end, but for some reason it's not automatic. *pause* Oh, and I can probably generate a detailed report for the past three months too, if that helps? Reference number RPT-2024-Q4-827.

Customer [en]: Um, yes. Please. Absolutely. You're saving my December here.

Customer Support [en]: *soft laugh* Well... that's probably the nicest thing anyone's said to me today. Report should hit your email in about, mmm, fifteen minutes? And going forward, all your statements will have those itemized details. Anything else I can help clarify while I have everything pulled up?
