============================================================

1. Good afternoon! Let me—let me pull up your account here. Do you happen to have your, um, your order number? It would start with ORD dash and then some numbers.
2. Oh I completely understand that frustration! So here's what I can do. I can—I can look you up by your practice name. And then we'll get this sorted. Right away. What's the name of your orthodontic office?
3. Perfect perfect perfect! Bright Smiles Orthodontics. I've got you. Right here. Account number ACC-45791-B. So I can see, um, let me just... okay so there's an order from Tuesday? ORD-8823-QV91?
4. Okay okay. Tell me—tell me what's happening with it. I'm looking at the... what's the... the manifest here and I can see you ordered, um, orthodontic brackets and some elastics?
5. Absolutely! And that's—that's exactly what we're gonna do. Right now. Together. So it looks like, hmm, the shipment shows delivered but you're saying the items are wrong?
6. Oh! Oh oh oh I see—I see what happened! This is, um, this is actually... let me check the warehouse code. WH-7739. Yeah. Classic mix-up. Someone grabbed from the wrong bin.
7. No no no, you don't need to—to apologize at all! This is a big deal. But here's the thing. I can—I can actually fix this faster than a supervisor could. Priority reshipment. Today.
8. I'm initiating it. Right. Now. New order number ORD-8829-QV92. And I'm—I'm marking it as, um, what we call... critical medical supplies. That means overnight. No charge.
9. Hey hey, don't even—don't even worry about it! You need those brackets for patients. Tomorrow. I get it. So your tracking number, um, it's gonna be TRK-99428-XPRS. You'll get an email in about, hmm, five minutes?
10. You're—you're totally fine! And actually? I'm adding a credit. CRD-1187-APL. For the hassle. Fifty dollars off your next order. Because nobody—nobody should get dental floss when they need brackets!
11. Oh, hello there! Let me just... what's the word... authenticate your account here, and I'll need to pull up your case number, which should be... hmm... are you calling about order EQP-7734-NX or is this about the facilities request?
12. Okay, so I'm seeing your facilities request FRQ-8829-TK41 here, and um, I want to make absolutely sure I understand what's been happening—you've called twice before about this same issue, is that correct?
13. Oh no, that's... hmm... let me check the notes here on FRQ-8829-TK41, and I can see that, yes, you were transferred multiple times on November 3rd, and it looks like the call dropped after seventeen minutes?
14. That's actually—you know what, I used to work in university admin myself before this, and the runaround is... it's like a sport sometimes, isn't it? Let me make sure this gets handled properly today with tracking number TRK-99847-MM.
15. I really do, and um, between you and me, I once spent forty minutes trying to get... what's the word... requisition approval for volleyball nets, so I'm going to personally monitor your case FRQ-8829-TK41 to make sure it doesn't disappear into the void again.
16. Okay, I hear you being... hmm... cautious, and you should be, but here's what's different—I'm creating an escalation ticket ESC-4421-QP right now while we're talking, and I'm putting my direct extension in the notes, which is 4487.
17. My actual desk extension 4487, and I'm also... let me just double-check this... yes, I'm setting a callback flag for tomorrow at 2PM Eastern in the system under reference CBK-7789-ST, does that time work for you?
18. I completely understand the skepticism, and honestly, if I were you, I'd be... what's the term... dubious too, but I'm documenting this in three different systems right now—the main ticket FRQ-8829-TK41, the escalation ESC-4421-QP, and our callback system CBK-7789-ST.
19. So, um, I'm looking at the actual issue here, and it's a vendor authorization hold on purchase order PO-6673-YY28, which needs... hmm... let me see... it needs finance approval, but finance kicked it back because of a coding error in line item seven.
20. I know, it's... it's ridiculous honestly, and here's what I'm doing—I'm fixing the coding right now while we're on the phone, changing it from 7744-B to 7744-C in the system, and submitting directly to finance with priority flag PRY-8892-KL, so this should be resolved within twenty-four hours.
21. Oh I hear you, I really do. Let me... hmm... pull up your account VND-4521-BC here and... yeah, I see what you mean about those charges.
22. I know, I get it. Trust me, our billing system for... for ingredient suppliers is... let me find the right... it's frustrating for us too. Your account shows three different rates - $42.50, $38.00, and now $47.25 for the exact same SKU-88412-VE extract.
23. So, umm, yeah there's... there's actually three different charges here. Let me... hmm... okay so transaction TXN-9981542 shows thirty-eight, but the newest one from yesterday, that's... that's the forty-seven twenty-five.
24. Honestly? Neither do I sometimes. It's... the system uses this... what's the term... dynamic pricing model? But for a perfectionist like you, working with exact measurements, I can imagine how... how maddening this must be.
25. Right, right. I'm gonna... hmm... let me try to lock in a rate for you. Your supplier code SUP-7745-QX should qualify for... for fixed pricing. Been doing this five years and still... still fighting this system daily.
26. Tell me about it. Some days I just... anyway. Let me submit request REQ-445821-FP for fixed pricing. Should take... hmm... forty-eight to seventy-two hours.
27. Umm, seventy-two. Three days. But, uh, between you and me? I'm gonna... gonna flag it priority. These vanilla extract orders under PO-8827-VAN, they're... they're time-sensitive for baking, right?
28. I feel that. My mom's a baker, actually. One degree off, one gram wrong, whole thing's ruined. Let me add note NTE-55429 about... about precision requirements.
29. Um, honestly? The fixed rate under contract CTR-9945-B should... should stick. But I'm also gonna, uh, put you on my callback list. If it changes again, I'll... I'll personally handle it.
30. I know. I really... really do know. Your case number's CSE-78221-VE and, um, my direct extension's 4455. Sometimes the system wins but... but today we're gonna make this work. Promise.
31. Oh okay so um let me just—er, pull up your account here real quick and uh, what's the—sorry, what's your order number or um do you have like the confirmation code maybe? Because I can, uh, search either way and we'll definitely figure this out.
32. No worries at all, um totally get it, so let me just—er what's your email and I'll look it up that way—oh wait actually, uh, is this for like massage equipment or supplies or something? Because we've been having, um, honestly ridiculous issues with refunds in that whole category.
33. Okay okay so um I'm pulling up—er, here we go, I see it now, transaction ID TXN-449823-ML and uh yeah this is... hmm, okay so this is embarrassing but you're totally right, there's two refund promises here from like—wait no, sorry, three actually.
34. Yeah no I know, it's um, it's honestly ridiculous and I'm really sorry about this whole—er, okay so the third one was an automatic thing when the second one failed, reference number REF-8827-QP, which um obviously didn't work either and uh that's just... yeah.
35. Absolutely, um yes, so here's what I'm gonna do—and er actually you know what? No, we're fixing this today, like I'm putting in an override code OVR-6634-TK right now and um basically I'm marking this as priority-critical which means it has to process within 24 hours or my supervisor gets an alert.
36. Oh man, yeah I can see here—wait they used code STD-3392-R which is just standard processing, that's why it got stuck, but um with the override I'm doing, it literally can't fail unless like our entire system crashes.
37. Honestly? Um I used to work retail before this and er had a vendor not refund me for like two months once, so I totally—uh, totally get how frustrating this is, and actually your case number CSE-7701-MX now has my direct extension attached so if anything goes wrong you call back and ask for me specifically.
38. Yeah for sure, um and actually—er, you know what, let me also add a courtesy credit, code CRD-5589-PL, for the inconvenience because three failed refunds is just—I mean that's on us, that's ridiculous.
39. Oh perfect timing then—so um the refund hits your account tomorrow by 3PM, confirmation RFD-9923-XK, and er the courtesy credit of fifty dollars processes immediately so you should actually see that within like an hour.
40. Hey no problem at all, and um seriously if there's any issue—which there won't be but just in case—my extension is 4782 and er just ask for Dana, I'll make sure this gets sorted because yeah, massage therapists literally help people feel better so the least we can do is not make your life harder, you know?
41. Oh okay, um, so basically let me just, uh, pull that up for you here. Can you, er, give me your order number or, um, the email you used?
42. No worries at all, uh, happens all the time. So, um, what's the email and I'll just, er, track it down real quick?
43. Perfect, got it. Okay so, um, I'm seeing order SLP-9847-MZ here, uh, placed Tuesday for our, er, RapidRest formula, and hmm, looks like it's... oh interesting.
44. So, um, actually no, it says delivered but, uh, to the wrong address. System shows, er, 4782 Oak instead of, um, lemme see... should be 4728 Oak, so basically someone transposed the numbers.
45. Yeah, I totally get it. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, uh, I've already flagged this as, er, critical reshipment code CRT-7739-AA, and basically we're overnighting a replacement, um, no charge obviously.
46. So, um, with expedited processing, uh, you'll have it by, er, 10 AM tomorrow guaranteed. I'm also, um, adding a second bottle, compensation code CMP-2847-BX, because, uh, honestly this shouldn't have happened.
47. Um, yeah, so basically it's, uh, kind of my thing. I've been here five years and, er, when I see healthcare workers I just, um, I know what you guys are dealing with, so... tracking number TRK-9982-MLP should hit your email in like ten minutes.
48. Oh and, um, just so you know, uh, I'm putting a note in your account, er, reference RFN-3369-QT, so basically next time you order, um, you'll automatically get our medical professional discount, like 30% off everything.
49. So, er, quick tip while I've got you. Um, those supplements work better if you, uh, take them with our magnesium blend, product code MAG-4400-SL. I'm just, um, gonna add a sample pack to your shipment.
50. Um, absolutely. So basically everything's set, uh, order confirmation CNF-8892-XK is coming your way, and, er, honestly? Get some rest when you can. We've, um, got you covered on this end.
51. Oh, um, okay so, uh, let me just... hmm, pull up the, um, what's the word... the transfer protocols here, and uh, I'll need to verify some things first if that's...
52. Right right, so um, first I need your account number, and uh, basically we have this whole, um, verification process—it's like a security thing—and then I'll need the, er, the recipient's information too.
53. No rush! Take your time. While you're, um, looking for that, I should mention that, uh, transfers usually take about, hmm, three to five business days and there's a, um, a processing fee of... let me see here... thirty-five dollars.
54. I know, I know, and um, actually let me just, uh, check your account history here... oh wow, yeah, member since 2012, account ACT-78294-QM, and uh, you know what? Let me see if there's any, um, loyalty discounts I can...
55. Perfect, so that's, um, 447289, and I'm seeing here that, uh, hmm, this is a premium tier account, which means... oh actually, good news, premium members get, um, one free ownership transfer per year.
56. So um, now I just need, uh, the full legal name of the person you're transferring to, and, er, their email address, and then basically we'll send them a, um, a verification link with code VRF-92847-TK to confirm.
57. Got it, Sarah Chen, and um, the email address?
58. Okay so, uh, schen at gmail dot com, perfect, and um, let me just, er, double-check everything here... account 447289 transferring to Sarah Chen... hmm, is there any specific reason for the transfer, just for our records...
59. Oh, I'm... right, okay, so um, I'll just mark this as, uh, personal reasons, and er, actually in these cases we can, um, expedite it to twenty-four hours if you need... I mean, if that would help...
60. Absolutely, so I'm, uh, marking this as priority case PRI-58392-LL, and um, Sarah should get the verification email within, er, the next hour, and once she clicks that link and enters code VRF-92847-TK, the transfer will, um, complete by tomorrow afternoon.
61. Oh no, I'm so—let me just—okay so, um, I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Can you, uh, give me your account number? I'll, hmm, pull everything up right away and we'll figure this out together.
62. Perfect, got it. So I'm looking at account 4472-9B here, and I can see—oh wow, yeah there's definitely some discrepancies between your purchase orders and what we've been billing. This shouldn't have happened.
63. Oh gosh, I'm—hmm, let me see here—so you already, um, spoke with someone and they just... didn't fix it? That's, uh, that's completely unacceptable. Looking at case number CSE-9982-YK41, I can see the notes but—no wait—they didn't actually process the adjustment.
64. No no no, this is absolutely not on you at all. This is our mistake, completely. The adjustment request ADJ-7761-MP should have been processed immediately. I'm actually really upset this happened to you.
65. No! Um, actually—let me just—so I'm looking at your PO submissions, uh, PO-8827 through PO-8835, and they're, um, they're perfect. Every single one. You're doing everything exactly right, it's our billing system that's, uh, somehow not matching them up.
66. Three times? Oh my—I'm pulling up your history here and... yeah. October, December, and now. That's completely ridiculous. Reference tickets TKT-9901-A, TKT-0122-C, and TKT-0298-F all show the same issue.
67. Okay so—hmm, let me think—I'm going to, um, do something different. Instead of just, uh, submitting another adjustment, I'm actually going to—no wait—I'm escalating this directly to, um, our billing ops manager with priority code PRI-RED-8847.
68. Right right. I know it sounds like just more promises. But this code bypasses the normal queue completely. It goes straight to management review within two hours. Not two weeks. Two hours.
69. I can—hmm—I can actually see that pattern in your account. Um, so what if we just—let me see here—I'm setting up, uh, a permanent billing override, code OVR-3321-PERM, so this literally, um, can't happen again.
70. Absolutely. Just finished it. Override confirmation OVR-3321-PERM-CONFIRMED is active on your account. Your POs will now auto-match correctly. Forever. No more monthly calls about this.
71. Okay, so um, let me just pull that up for you here and, uh, I'll need to verify some information first if that's... Can I get your account number?
72. So, um, I'm seeing that here, ACC-48291-B, and uh, let me just... hmm, okay so there's definitely something, um, unusual happening with the verification status here.
73. Right right, so basically what's happening is, um, your account got flagged for, uh, let me see here... it's showing code VER-7739-X which is like a... what's the term... a recursive verification request?
74. Oh you work in financial aid? That must be, um, really frustrating then, dealing with this on your own account when you know the system so well.
75. Of course, of course, so um, what I'm going to do is, uh, I need to manually override this but, hmm, it requires a supervisor code, so let me just... Can you hold for just a moment while I grab that?
76. Actually wait, um, before I do that, let me try something else here because, uh, sometimes if we resubmit with reference number REF-2024-88156, it can, you know, bypass the loop entirely.
77. So I'm submitting that now and, um, oh wow, it's actually... okay so it's processing, which is, uh, a good sign because before it was just instantly rejecting, you know?
78. Well, so, it's showing as pending now with confirmation PND-93847-K, which means it should clear in, um, let me check the timeline here... approximately 24 to 48 hours.
79. Oh no, three weeks? I'm so sorry you've been dealing with this that long, but it should definitely be resolved now, and you'll get an email to the address we have on file once it completes.
80. I'm really glad I could help! And hey, if for any reason it doesn't clear by Thursday, just reference case number CSE-48291-B-01 and any rep can check the status immediately for you, okay?
81. Okay. Let me just... pull that up. What's your, um, driver ID?
82. Got it. So, um, I see here... driver account DVR-4872-QM3. And it's showing, uh... deactivated status as of, hmm, this morning at 8:47 AM.
83. Right. So... checking here... violation code VLC-227-X. That's, um, that's for... incomplete deliveries.
84. So basically, um, the system's showing, uh, three orders last week that were, like, marked as not delivered? Order refs ORD-9923-KP, ORD-9967-ML, and, um, ORD-9981-ZT.
85. Yeah. I know. It's... ridiculous. System doesn't, um, doesn't care about context.
86. Um, so here's the thing. I can, uh, I can submit an appeal but, like, the review team takes, hmm, usually 3 to 5 business days to, um, to process these under case number APL-7764-MNQ.
87. I know. Trust me. It's, um... it's stupid. The whole process.
88. Well. Actually. Hmm. Let me, um, let me try something. There's this, uh, expedited review flag EXP-443 I can... technically add.
89. No no. I get it. So, um, with the expedite code, it should be, like, 24 hours max? Maybe less. Your ticket's now TKT-8876-PPV with, uh, priority status.
90. Hey. Don't, um, don't apologize. System's trash. We both, uh, we both know it. Check back tomorrow. Should be... should be sorted.
91. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Um, I think—let me pull up your account. What's your—actually, can I get your phone number first?
92. Got it, thank you. So I see account ACC-9982-TK here and... oh. Oh dear. I'm really, really sorry. There's notes about yesterday.
93. Well it says here the call dropped? Three times? And reference REF-2024-8847 shows... nobody called you back? That's not—I mean, that shouldn't happen.
94. I'm so, so sorry about that. Really. Let me—I think I can probably help fix whatever the original issue was? What were you calling about?
95. Double charged for months? That's... that's weird actually. Let me look at billing code BIL-4429-XX. Hmm. Oh. Oh this is interesting.
96. No no, it's good! Well, sort of. I mean—I can see the problem now. Transaction TRX-7765-MN keeps duplicating. System glitch maybe?
97. Absolutely. Yes. I'm applying credit code CRD-9901-LP right now. Should cover... wow. Four months of overcharges. I'm really sorry.
98. Credit's processing. Should hit your account in twenty-four hours. Reference number is REF-2024-8849. And I'm adding priority flag PRI-GOLD so you skip the queue next time.
99. I know. I get it. Really. But that priority code? It routes straight to senior reps. No more drops. I promise.
100. It will. Confirmation CON-5547-RZ is in your email now. And hey—I'm genuinely sorry about yesterday. That wasn't okay.
101. Oh hey there! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or phone number associated with it?
102. Perfect, got it! So I'm seeing account ACC-9847-YZ here under your name, and, hmm, looks like you recently changed plans on October 15th, right?
103. Right, so um, what happens is—and honestly this confuses everyone—when you switch mid-cycle, you get these pro-rated charges. So you're paying for, uh, like partial months of both plans on bill BIL-44892-KP.
104. Yeah, I know, it's kind of ridiculous how they show it. But no, not really twice. You paid for 15 days of your old plan, then 15 days of the new one. The system just displays it weird on invoice INV-7234-MM.
105. Absolutely. So your total this month is $127.43 on statement STM-9901-QR. Next month'll go back to your regular $79.99.
106. So, um, let me break this down better. Your old plan was $59.99, used half month, so that's um, about $30. New plan's $79.99, also half month, so uh, $40. Plus there's an upgrade fee UPG-3356-TT of $35.
107. Yeah no, I totally get it. These fees are—honestly? They're annoying. Let me see if I can maybe waive that for you, one sec.
108. Okay so, good news! I applied credit CRD-8823-VX for that $35 fee. Should show up in like 24-48 hours.
109. Yep! Starting with your November cycle on the 30th, statement STM-9902-QS will just show the regular $79.99, no weird pro-rated anything.
110. You're all set! And hey, I added a note NDT-7745-LP to your account about this confusion, so if you call again, whoever helps you will know what happened. Anything else I can help with today?
111. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear you had a poor experience. Let me just pull up that location here—um, that's store number STR-4412-MP on Maple, and I'm going to... what's the word... document everything so we can protect other customers from having the same issue. What happened there?
112. Fifteen minutes? That's—no wait, that's completely unacceptable. I'm pulling up the shift log for yesterday, um, reference number SFT-91847-B, and I'm going to make absolutely sure the district manager sees this personally because... hmm... nobody should experience that.
113. Rolling their eyes? I'm documenting this under complaint ID CMP-7263-XR91, and listen, I'm going to... um... what I want to do is make sure you never have to deal with that again. Can you tell me approximately what time this happened?
114. Okay so between 2:30 and 3:00 PM, I've got that logged here in report RPT-5582-AFT, and I'm—let me just—actually I'm also going to flag this for immediate review because that's our peak training hour and there's no excuse for that behavior.
115. Absolutely, I mean, um, I'm not just filing this away. Your case number CSE-9901-MP is going directly to regional management, and I'm going to... hmm... I'm personally adding a priority flag so it gets addressed within 24 hours. This is the kind of thing we take very seriously.
116. Well, I wish I could, um, do even more honestly. I mean, if I had my way, I'd—no wait, let me be clear—I'm limited in what compensation I can offer directly, but I am ensuring this gets escalated properly under escalation code ESC-7734-HL.
117. So, um, here's what I can promise you—the district manager will review case CSE-9901-MP within one business day, and... hmm... you should receive a follow-up call within 48 to 72 hours. I'm also, um, adding your contact information to our priority callback list.
118. Just wait for now, but I'm going to... what's the best way to put this... I'm setting up a safeguard here. If you don't hear back within 72 hours, your reference number is REF-4455-MPSTR, and you can call us directly and we'll expedite it immediately.
119. I'm glad I could help! Though I do wish, um, our system let me... er... guarantee faster resolution times. But with tracking number TRK-8821-QV in place, this won't get lost or ignored, I promise you that.
120. Of course! Um, nobody should experience what you did, and I'm going to make absolutely sure this gets addressed. Your confirmation number for this call is CNF-9964-SERV, and, um, please don't hesitate to reference that if you need to follow up. We're here to protect our customers' shopping experience.
121. Oh hi yes hello thank you for calling I see you're calling about a reimbursement issue let me just pull up your account real quick here what's your account number or phone number?
122. Right right got it so um I'm pulling up account ACC-7829-VH and uh let me just... okay so I see here you submitted a claim on October 12th for vehicle maintenance reimbursement claim number CLM-2024-18923 is that correct?
123. So um actually I can see here that uh the claim was reviewed on October 15th and hmm it says here it was denied because the receipts didn't match the pre-approved maintenance categories under code MNT-4472-B did you submit for oil changes or was it something else?
124. Okay okay um so like here's what I'm seeing uh the system shows the receipt was from uh Joe's Auto Care and um apparently they're not on our approved vendor list VND-8829-LIST which is why it got flagged.
125. No no I totally get it let me just... breathe... okay so I can actually send you the full approved vendor list it's document DOC-5547-VENDORS and you'll see all 847 approved locations in your area code.
126. Absolutely yes I see that here three years two months actually since August 2021 driver ID DRV-6672-K and you know what let me check if there's something we can do here.
127. So um I'm looking at your history and uh you've had twelve successful reimbursements before totaling $3,247 all processed fine so hmm let me see if I can maybe submit this for manual review under exception code EXC-9981-LOYAL.
128. Right so basically um instead of the automatic system a real person will uh look at your claim and like they can override the vendor list requirement if um if the receipt is legitimate and everything checks out.
129. Um okay so like when I submit this you'll get uh you'll get an email with case number CSE-4420-MNR and um the reviewer's initials will be on the decision letter so uh you'll know exactly who reviewed it not just some automated thing.
130. Got it yes absolutely I'm submitting this right now for priority review should have an answer within 48 hours reference number REF-8827-PRIORITY and honestly your history is solid so I think you'll be fine.
131. Right right, so let me pull up your account here... okay I'm seeing invoice INV-3847-QZ92 from yesterday and yes, there's definitely an error showing negative inventory which shouldn't be possible in our system.
132. So um, this is—this is actually a known issue we're seeing with, uh, with the new update and um, basically what happens is, er, when you enter quantities manually it sometimes, um, reverses the values in the system.
133. I completely understand your frustration and, um, honestly between you and me, uh, this new system has been, er, causing headaches for a lot of our longtime clients who are used to, um, you know, things just working.
134. Okay so, um, what I can do right now is, uh, void that invoice INV-3847-QZ92 and, er, create a corrected one but um, the thing is, it's going to generate a credit memo CMO-7263-LP first.
135. Yeah so, um, I know it sounds backwards but, uh, that credit memo is actually, er, going to balance out the negative entry and then, um, once that processes—usually takes about, uh, twenty minutes—we can enter the correct invoice.
136. So um, while we're waiting for that to, uh, process, I can also, er, add a note to your account ACC-5519-BM88 that, um, basically flags you for manual review so this, uh, shouldn't happen again with future invoices.
137. Exactly, so um, any invoice over, er, let's say fifty items or, uh, over two thousand dollars gets, um, reviewed by an actual person before it, uh, goes through to make sure there's no, um, weird glitches like this.
138. Right, and um, I'm also going to, uh, email you a backup spreadsheet template—er, reference number TMP-8847-XX—that you can, um, use to keep your own records just in case, you know, the system acts up again.
139. Yeah so, um, it's basically like, uh, digital graph paper and, er, once you get used to it, it's actually, um, pretty similar to the old ledger books, just, uh, the math happens automatically.
140. Okay that's fair, that's totally fair, but I promise this spreadsheet won't try to reverse the laws of physics, and if you have any issues at all, you can call back and ask for me directly—just reference case number CSE-9982-TK41 and I'll make sure we get everything sorted properly.
141. Absolutely, yeah yeah, I'm gonna, um, make sure we get all your privacy questions answered today. So let me just, uh, pull up your account here with ID ACC-7739-PX and, um, what specific privacy concerns did you—did you want to know about?
142. Right right, so that's—that's a really good question and um, I think it's important you know exactly what we store, so basically your profile PFL-8826-QM contains, uh, your name, email, shipping addresses, and then we also...
143. Yeah so, um, we do keep—keep a history of, uh, I think it's the last five addresses you've used, and looking at your data retention code DRC-445, um, they're stored for eighteen months, but here's the thing...
144. Okay okay, so, ummm, this is where I'm gonna, like, really advocate for you here because, uh, we only store the last four digits, never the full number, and your security token SEC-9102-YT shows, um, everything's encrypted with, er, bank-level protection, so that's sort of...
145. So, hmm, let me think about how to explain this properly, um, your activity log ALG-3367-KD does track, uh, products you've viewed and, er, items in your cart, but—but we're not like, you know, watching everything you do, it's more for, um, helping with recommendations and stuff...
146. No no no, absolutely not forever, um, so I'm looking at your privacy dashboard right now, code PDH-8841-LN, and, uh, browsing data gets—gets automatically deleted after, hmm, ninety days, unless you've, er, added something to your wishlist, then it's kind of...
147. YES! Absolutely, and—and this is where I get, um, kind of excited because we actually have this, uh, really good self-service portal, let me get you the link, it's portal.site.com/privacy/USR-6629-RT, and you can literally just, um, pick what to delete whenever you want, I mean...
148. Right right, so your preference center, um, that's PFC-2205-BX, shows you're—you're currently opted into, uh, weekly deals only, but honestly? You can change that anytime, and we also, er, never ever share your email with third parties, that's just...
149. So, ummm, I'm gonna be totally transparent here, your data sharing agreement DSA-7714-MP shows, like, we do share with, uh, our shipping partners obviously, but—but only what they need, just name and address, nothing else, and we fight pretty hard to keep it minimal because honestly we think...
150. Of course! And, um, hey, I'm gonna send you our full privacy guide, document DOC-8845-ZK, to your email right now, and—and if you have any other questions, even like, months from now? Just reference case number CSE-9921-TQ and we'll, uh, we'll take care of you, okay?
151. Hello there! Let me just—hmm, okay so—let me pull up your account. What's the last four of the card?
152. Absolutely! So I'm seeing—let me see here—okay your account ending in 4829. Perfect. Now. Tell me about this charge. When did you notice it?
153. Got it, got it. So what I'm gonna do—actually wait—let me check your transaction history here. Reference number TXN-88291-QP. Hmm, I see a charge. How much. Was the amount?
154. Okay so, um, I'm seeing—let me think—yes! Seventy-eight fifty-three from MerchantID MRC-2847-XX on November third. That one. Right?
155. Perfect! Now here's what—hmm—here's what we're gonna do. I'm filing dispute case DSP-994521-R right now. Quick question. Did you. Um. Give your card to anyone recently?
156. Right right. Totally different. So, um, let me just—okay so—I'm marking this as unauthorized. Case DSP-994521-R is now active. The great news? We'll credit you. Within twenty-four hours.
157. Every penny! So what happens is—hmm, let me explain—provisional credit PRV-88476-C posts tomorrow. Full seventy-eight fifty-three. Then. We investigate. But you keep the credit!
158. Nope! I'm handling—actually wait—let me make sure... yes! All handled. Reference DSP-994521-R for your records. But listen. Here's what I want you to do. For protection.
159. No no no. Don't worry. But, um, I'm gonna—hmm—I'm sending you a new card. Expedited. Tracking EXP-7739-MK22. Should arrive. In two days. Just to be safe, okay?
160. Um, yes exactly! So your case DSP-994521-R is all set, provisional credit PRV-88476-C tomorrow, and, uh, new card with tracking EXP-7739-MK22 on the way. You're. Completely. Protected now.
161. Oh! Okay okay, let me—let me pull up. Your account. Account number ACC-7294-MN82. I see. The charges. Right here.
162. No no no, I'm—I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna make sure we fix this, uh, completely. These charges. From, um, crossing between. Montana. Idaho. Transaction TXN-893847-K.
163. So so, um, what happened—let me just—actually, uh, your plan PLA-4482-X has, um, some gaps. Near borders. I'm—I'm seeing it.
164. Listen, I'm gonna—okay okay, um, I'm gonna protect you from this, uh, happening again. Setting up. Um. Interstate coverage ICC-9938-RT. No more. Surprise charges.
165. Actually—no wait—um, it's it's free. I'm adding, uh, truck driver exemption code TDE-2847. Because, um, this shouldn't. Have happened.
166. Right right. Confirmation email. Sent now. Reference REF-38827-QP shows. Every adjustment. Every credit.
167. Yes. Absolutely. System error SE-4429 flagged. Your routes. Incorrectly. Getting you. Full refund.
168. Every—every single one, um, all $347.82 under, uh, credit note CRN-5563-LP. Plus. Um. Three months. Free upgrade.
169. So so, um, unlimited nationwide data, uh, no restrictions UNL-8827-NA. I just—I just want to, um, make sure. You're protected.
170. Look. I've—I've expedited. Refund RFN-6621-XK. Tomorrow. Your account. Not three days. Tomorrow. Because this. Was wrong.
171. No worries at all. Let me. Pull up. Your account here. What's the promo code you're trying to use?
172. SAVE20, got it got it. So that's that's actually code PRM-SAVE20-Q4. Checking your cart now. What's your email on the account?
173. Perfect. Account. Located. ID number ACC-98234-JM7. So here's the thing... that code expired. Yesterday. At midnight.
174. Um, honestly? Our promo emails are are terrible about showing expiration dates, like, they bury it in tiny text at the bottom, so, uh, I get why you missed it, happens constantly.
175. Oh yeah yeah yeah. All. The. Time. Let me just, um... okay so I'm looking at code batch BCH-7829-WINTER and, hmm, I might have something better anyway if you...
176. So technically technically, uh, I'm supposed to just say "sorry, expired" but, like, between you and me? System lets me apply override code OVR-25PCT-DISCRETION which is actually, um, five percent better than what you had.
177. Nah. You're good. Transaction TXN-445892301 processing now. Should see. The discount. Applied.
178. Listen, um, our code system is is genuinely awful, like, we have probably, uh, two hundred active codes in database DB-PROMO-2024 and half of them don't even work right, so...
179. Confirmation number. CNF-20847-YAB. All set. And hey hey, uh, pro tip? Sign up for text alerts, they're way better about...
180. Um, if you can't get the texts working, just, uh, call back and ask for reference case CSE-8829-DISC, we can we can sort it out, but yeah, you're all set now, so...
181. Oh no, um, I'm so— so sorry to hear that's happened. Let me, uh, pull up your account right away here, um, just need to get into the system and— okay okay, can I get your account number?
182. Perfect perfect, thank you. So I've got account 472839 here and, um, I can see— oh wow, you really have been with us since, uh, 2016. That's— that's amazing loyalty and I'm, er, really really sorry you're dealing with this.
183. Okay so, um, looking at transaction TXN-9847-MK22, there's, uh, a late fee from— from October 15th and it says, um, the payment was received on the, er, the 18th instead of the 15th due date.
184. Oh, um, that's— that's definitely not right then. I'm, uh, I'm checking the payment log here, reference number REF-7829-QT, and— hmm, this is, er, really strange because I see what you're saying.
185. Yes yes, absolutely! I see, um, there's a pending status on the 13th that, uh, didn't clear until— oh this is so frustrating, I know exactly what happened here with our processing system.
186. No no, you don't— don't need to do anything! I'm, um, I'm actually gonna fix this right now, like, er, immediately. Creating adjustment ADJ-5502-BN right now.
187. Already done! The, uh, the twenty-five dollars is being credited back, confirmation code CNF-8847-LP33, and, um, honestly? I'm— I'm also adding a five dollar courtesy credit because this never should've happened.
188. Listen, um, eight years is— is incredible. You deserve, er, so much better than dealing with incorrect fees. The credits will show in, uh, 24 to 48 hours under transaction TXN-9848-MK23.
189. Never never! Not on my watch. I've, um, also put a note, case number CSE-7749-RT, so if— if this ever happens again, any rep will see we've already verified your payment habits are, uh, perfect.
190. Of course! And, um, here's my direct extension— 4429. If you ever, er, have any issues, just— just ask for Maya. I remember the good customers.
191. Oh gosh, um, okay okay, let me just, uh... pull up the account recovery form here and we'll get this sorted, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, it's been such a busy morning but let's, um, let's focus on getting you back in.
192. Right right, so, um, I'm seeing here that we'll need to verify... uh, let me just... okay so first I need your original email address that was, um, associated with the account before all this happened?
193. Got it, s chen 1987, and, uh, hmm, the system's being a bit... okay there we go, so I'm generating a case number for you, that's gonna be CSE-4492-NM88, and um, when did you first notice the unauthorized access?
194. Absolutely.
195. So, uh, I completely understand how critical this is, and um, let me just... okay so the recovery process, it's gonna require some verification steps here, I'm seeing your account ID is USR-88254-QV, and, uh, we'll need to confirm some details.
196. Right right.
197. So typically, um, the standard recovery is 24 to 48 hours but, uh, given your situation... hmm, let me see if I can... okay so there's an expedited process, reference code EXP-7731-BC, but I'll need to, um, verify three security questions first.
198. It's okay, we have, um, backup verification methods if needed, so uh, first question here... what was the name of your first pet?
199. Hmm, that's... uh, not quite matching what I have here, but let's try the next one, um, so what street did you grow up on?
200. I understand your frustration, I really do, but, um, for security reasons I can't bypass... uh, let me offer an alternative though, we can do identity verification through document upload, that's form IDV-9924-X, and that usually processes within 2-3 hours instead of the full 24.
201. That's concerning. In my experience as a safety engineer, [cry] de-escalation techniques are crucial because they prevent situations from reaching that breaking point where physical intervention becomes necessary.
202. The first principle is creating space—both physical and emotional. You want to maintain at least two arm lengths distance while keeping your body language open and non-threatening.
203. Then you employ lateral movement, never backing straight up because that can feel like retreat. Move at angles while maintaining eye contact and using a calm, lower-pitched voice.
204. Absolutely. So, you want to speak, uh, about 20% slower than normal and, basically, drop your pitch because, you know, higher voices can actually trigger more aggression.
205. You're right to question that. Matching aggressive energy escalates things further—instead, you want to be the thermostat, not the thermometer, setting the emotional temperature rather than reflecting it.
206. Document everything but don't engage with the threat directly. Acknowledge their feelings without validating threatening behavior, saying something like "I understand you're frustrated, let's find a solution together."
207. Crowds complicate things because, well, people perform for audiences and, I mean, feel pressure to save face, so actually, if possible, you want to, er, move the conversation somewhere more private.
208. Yes, twice in fifteen years. Both times involved substance impairment where rational communication wasn't possible, which is why we always have backup protocols ready.
209. Emotional regulation of yourself is, um, [shaky voice] absolutely critical because if you can't, you know, manage your own fear or anger, basically, you become part of the problem.
210. Formal training is essential—you wouldn't operate heavy machinery without proper certification, and de-escalation involves human safety which is even more complex and consequential.
211. Oh, um, that's actually fine—I'm flexible and, you know, we can talk about whatever's on your mind, pizza included.
212. Well, I'm here for it, basically, whichever direction you want to go, er, because sometimes the best conversations happen when we let them flow naturally.
213. So, neighbor issues can be really draining, hmm, especially when you're dealing with them daily—I guess, what specific behaviors are causing the most problems?
214. That's incredibly frustrating, and the entitlement makes it worse. Have you tried documenting it with photos and timestamps to build a case with your landlord or HOA?
215. It might feel tedious, but documentation gives you leverage. Three weeks of photos showing your spot occupied could get immediate action from property management.
216. Anyway, most property managers, uhh, keep complaints anonymous, and the thing is, they usually send general notices to all residents first before targeting anyone specific.
217. That's a valid concern, and [high-pitched] if you're worried about escalation, you could start with a friendly note before going official—sometimes people genuinely don't realize they're causing problems.
218. I get it, direct confrontation feels more honest. But consider it strategic communication rather than passive aggression—you're creating a paper trail while giving them a chance to correct it.
219. Random shift but yes, twice actually! Prague's incredible with all that Gothic architecture and the astronomical clock—though I'm sensing you're deflecting from the neighbor situation.
220. Totally understandable—adulting is exhausting and conflict drains everyone. Sometimes the best strategy is taking a mental break and coming back to problems with fresh perspective.
221. Well, um, I just think it's, [very sad], you know, become this obsession that's honestly taking over our entire household dynamic.
222. It's not just reading anymore, though—like, she's spending hundreds of dollars monthly, and, uhh, the spare room is basically a library now, completely unusable.
223. So, mysteries give me something that, hmm, this family doesn't—they have resolution, the thing is, everything gets solved and makes sense by the end.
224. I'm saying that in an Agatha Christie novel, when someone's upset, there's always a clear reason, not just vague disappointment hanging in the air constantly.
225. Actually, your mother has a point, [sad], er, about needing escape—I mean, we've all been pretty checked out lately, not just her.
226. That's exactly it, and, well, at least mystery novels don't involve, you know, gambling or drinking—it's honestly a pretty harmless coping mechanism comparatively.
227. Wait, you've been checking [gasp softly] my personal statements? That's a violation of trust and privacy that we specifically agreed you wouldn't do anymore.
228. Oh great, so, the twenty-three-year-old, [groan], er, is lecturing us about being adults—anyway, maybe focus on your own life instead of micromanaging ours.
229. You're right, and maybe that's because [sneeze] we're treating symptoms instead of addressing the real issue—we don't actually enjoy being around each other anymore.
230. It's not dark, it's [very melancholic] just honest—and maybe if we read more mysteries together instead of separately, we'd find our way back to each other.
231. The regulatory framework around vendor inducements operates within a tripartite structure involving FCPA compliance, SOX requirements, and our internal code of conduct matrices.
232. Conference attendance falls under educational exemptions provided the aggregate value doesn't exceed $250 annually and there's documented business relevance per Policy 3.7.2 subsection A.
233. Well, meal expenditures require, hmm, pre-approval if exceeding $75 per person, and, you know, must be logged in the vendor interaction database within 48 hours.
234. The vendor interaction database, um, is mandatory training module VE-401, and, honestly, non-compliance triggers automatic escalation to the ethics committee for remediation assessment.
235. Severity depends on materiality thresholds and whether there's pattern behavior indicating systematic circumvention of procurement neutrality protocols established under our fiduciary responsibility framework.
236. Correct, we operate on, well, a five-tier violation matrix ranging from administrative notation to, you know, criminal referral for egregious breaches of anti-bribery statutes.
237. Distinguishing factors include quid pro quo expectations, frequency of interactions, proximity to RFP cycles, and whether benefits extend to family members or personal use.
238. That's absolutely a [confused] violation—spousal benefits are explicitly prohibited under Section 12.4 as they constitute indirect personal enrichment circumventing reporting requirements.
239. You'll need to file [apologetic] Form VE-77B immediately, and, er, honestly, voluntary disclosure might mitigate penalties from mandatory termination to probationary status.
240. Actually, the good news is, well, [excited] if you complete remedial training and, umm, maintain clean compliance for six months, this becomes a learning opportunity!
241. Oh, stop right there! Nobody starts with talent—everyone starts with curiosity and a willingness to make terrible art. The best artists I know made absolute garbage for years before they got good.
242. Ha! You should, um, see my first paintings—they looked like, you know, a toddler got into the finger paints. But here's the thing is, every bad painting teaches you something the good ones never could.
243. No no, like how colors actually, hmm, mix versus how you think they'll mix, or how, well, much water changes everything. Your mistakes become your teachers if you pay attention instead of judging yourself.
244. Then you'll be bad at something that brings you joy! How many things do we do perfectly that make us miserable? I'd rather paint badly and feel alive than excel at something that numbs me.
245. Maybe, but I've, er, watched too many people wait for "readiness" that never comes, you know? They die with their paintbrushes still in the package, their canvases pristine and useless.
246. Start with kids' tempera paint from the dollar store and cardboard if you have to. Seriously! Some of my favorite pieces came from experimenting with "wrong" materials because I couldn't afford the "right" ones.
247. Cardboard, newspaper, old wooden boards, even fabric scraps! Art doesn't care about your budget—it cares about your willingness to play and explore without needing permission.
248. Good! That means you're about to do something that matters to you. The only people who never look foolish are the ones who never try anything new or vulnerable.
249. Then you'll know they're not your people. The ones worth keeping around will celebrate your courage to create, not mock your beginner's attempts at finding your voice.
250. It's not simple, but it's, actually, simpler than you think—you literally just, er, pick up a brush and make a mark. Then another. The hardest part is believing you're allowed to begin.
251. Watch out for that cyclist— okay, so here's what I've learned after ten years of designing curricula: you absolutely need both approaches, but the ratio depends entirely on your learning objectives and student population.
252. Red light coming up— the trick is embedding testable components within project work, like having students document their process with reflection journals that hit specific competency benchmarks while still allowing creative exploration.
253. Actually, once you build the, er, framework properly, it becomes self-sustaining because, well, students start peer-reviewing using the same rubrics you've established, which, honestly, teaches them metacognition.
254. Turn signal— backwards design is simple: start with what students must demonstrate at the end, then work backwards to build scaffolding that gets them there, rather than starting with content and hoping it leads somewhere useful.
255. Sorry, merging here— so the interdisciplinary impact is, uhh, huge, and I guess what most departments miss is that math scaffolding affects science labs, basically economics courses, even art when they're doing perspective drawing.
256. Absolutely right, and, um, this is why we need a three-year curriculum cycle where, you know, year one is implementation, year two is data collection, and, well, year three is refinement before any major changes.
257. Parallel lane change— honestly, you start with early adopters and, err, let their success stories do the convincing, because, I mean, forced compliance never works as well as organic buy-in from seeing colleagues thrive.
258. That's exactly why you need to build in release time and extra compensation for curriculum pioneers— they're not just teaching, they're essentially doing R&D for the entire institution, and that deserves recognition.
259. Careful with that confidence— modular approaches work great in theory but require extensive prerequisite mapping and careful sequencing, otherwise students end up with huge gaps in foundational knowledge they need for advanced modules.
260. Parking here— look, the thing is, [pause] you need common assessments for key learning outcomes but, um, leave room for instructor autonomy in, basically, how they get students to those endpoints.
261. Oh wow, I absolutely love your enthusiasm about this dream! Let's definitely explore what that would look like, maybe we could start by mapping out the practical steps while keeping all that beautiful momentum you've got going.
262. That sounds incredibly freeing and I can [loudly] totally picture us doing that adventure together! What if we started experimenting with recipes on weekends first, just to build up our confidence and test what people love?
263. I hear you, and that [high-pitched] cosmic pull is so real and exciting! The thing is, even the best explorers pack their supplies first, so maybe we could honor that universal calling while still setting ourselves up for the most amazing success possible.
264. Ah, that took courage to, well, voice your truth like that, honestly! How did it feel to say those words out loud, and maybe we can use that brave energy to create our transition timeline?
265. Those mixed feelings are, uhh, completely natural when you're about to transform your whole life, I mean! Every successful entrepreneur I know started with that exact stomach-flipping combination of fear and pure possibility.
266. Oh sweetie, I [sniffle] completely understand that overwhelm with all the formal stuff! What if we made it visual instead, like a big colorful vision board with pictures and simple goals that feels more like creating art than doing homework?
267. Yes, exactly, and we could [sad] work on it bit by bit so nothing feels overwhelming! I'm thinking cozy afternoon sessions with good music and snacks, where we just dream and plan without any pressure at all.
268. Perfect pacing, yes! We'll make it an adventure from day one, trying out wild flavor combinations and seeing what makes people's faces light up, then capturing all that inspiration on our board.
269. That initiative is [empathetically] absolutely wonderful and shows how ready your heart is for this journey! Those preparations will be perfect when we're ready to launch, and having them will keep our dream feeling real and tangible every single day.
270. That's because your dreams ARE possible, and watching you chase them with such pure passion reminds me why taking brave leaps, even planned ones, makes life absolutely extraordinary!
271. Well, I think this is, um, an extraordinary opportunity to demonstrate emotional maturity, you know. The fact that you can all sit together speaks to a level of personal evolution that most people never actually achieve.
272. That performative display would, hmm, actually undermine the authentic confidence we're trying to project here, I mean. Real power comes from being so secure in ourselves that we don't need to prove anything to anyone, especially not through theatrical gestures.
273. The thing is, when people witness genuine [smiling speaking] happiness rather than staged demonstrations, it's far more impactful, you know. If we simply enjoy ourselves and let our natural chemistry shine, that authentic connection will speak volumes without us having to orchestrate anything at all.
274. Actually, subtle confidence would be, uh, ordering what you genuinely enjoy and letting your success emerge naturally in conversation, right so. When people try too hard to impress, it often reveals the insecurity they're trying to hide.
275. Not ridiculous at all, just, err, wonderfully human and processing complex emotions, honestly. Everyone who's been in your position has felt this exact cocktail of wanting to show you've moved on while simultaneously hoping they notice how well you're doing.
276. She does look lovely, and so do you, and acknowledging that takes nothing away from what we have. Beauty isn't a competition, it's just light reflecting differently off different people, each creating their own unique radiance.
277. A warm, genuine greeting would set the perfect tone for the evening. Remember, we're writing a new narrative here where everyone can coexist peacefully, maybe even become friends who share inside jokes about this initially awkward dinner.
278. Good for her, and good for us that we can appreciate aesthetics without feeling threatened. The universe isn't operating on scarcity when it comes to attractive, interesting people, there's abundance everywhere if we choose to see it that way.
279. That's the spirit, and remember I'm here as your partner in this adventure. We'll navigate this together with grace and humor, turning what could be awkward into something unexpectedly delightful.
280. Welcome both of you, we've been [loudly] looking forward to this evening! I've heard wonderful things about you Mark, and Sarah, it's lovely to finally meet the person who's been such an important part of this one's story.
281. It's fascinating because it challenges our intuition about expertise, suggesting that aggregated judgments from diverse non-experts can often outperform individual experts' predictions.
282. That's because, well, true wisdom of crowds requires specific conditions that social media violates, you know. You need independent judgments, decentralized organization, diversity of opinion, and mechanisms to aggregate private judgments into collective decisions.
283. Not lucky at all, hmm, because the mathematical principle is actually robust across domains. When errors are randomly distributed around the truth, they cancel out in aggregation, leaving you surprisingly close to the accurate answer.
284. The thing is, bubbles happen when the independence condition breaks down and people start, kind of, copying each other's judgments. Information cascades replace genuine wisdom, everyone following the person ahead rather than consulting their own knowledge.
285. The key is understanding problem types—crowds excel at estimation and prediction tasks where diverse perspectives add value, but struggle with specialized technical problems requiring deep domain expertise.
286. Exactly! Wikipedia is this [extremely happy] beautiful demonstration of collective intelligence emerging from structured collaboration. The editing guidelines and revision systems create the aggregation mechanism that transforms individual contributions into reliable knowledge.
287. Absolutely, which is why prediction markets often work better than committees—they maintain independence through individual betting rather than consensus-seeking discussion that homogenizes opinions.
288. That's the achilles heel, when the crowd shares [curious] common blind spots or prejudices. Diversity isn't just demographic but cognitive—you need people with different mental models, different ways of processing the same information.
289. In its ideal form, yes, it's just that democratic systems often violate the conditions, really. Representatives negotiate and horse-trade rather than independently judging, media creates information cascades, and voting systems poorly aggregate preferences.
290. That's a profound connection—ensemble methods in machine learning literally aggregate multiple models' predictions, and large language models aggregate patterns from millions of human texts, extracting collective intelligence from our written culture.
291. It's heartbreaking because we're [warm] watching this incredible ecosystem disappear in real-time, and the pace keeps accelerating despite all our supposed awareness and technology to monitor it.
292. Well, that's actually a complicated picture, sort of, because while Brazil had some successful years, we're seeing acceleration in other hotspots like the Congo Basin and Southeast Asian rainforests.
293. What's hmm, even worse is that basically, we're crossing tipping points, I mean, where sections of rainforest can't sustain their own rainfall patterns anymore and start converting to savanna irreversibly.
294. Cattle is huge in South America, er, but honestly, the thing is, palm oil plantations devastate Southeast Asia, while small-scale agriculture drives most African deforestation—it's not one simple villain we can target.
295. Most of them are borderline scams, planting monocultures that lack biodiversity, or counting trees that would've grown anyway, or worse, displacing local communities who actually protected the original forest.
296. Exactly! They'll trumpet planting a million saplings while their supply chains destroy established forests that took centuries to develop their complex interdependent ecosystems—young trees can't replace ancient forests' carbon storage or biodiversity.
297. That's the core injustice—we expect [shouting] the world's poorest people to preserve forests for everyone's benefit while offering them nothing! Rich nations deforested their way to prosperity, now demand others don't follow the same path.
298. Absolutely, right so, studies consistently show that um, indigenous-managed forests have basically the lowest deforestation rates. They've been the most effective forest guardians for millennia, yet they control less than thirty percent of their ancestral territories.
299. It's not just orangutans—we're in the middle of an extinction cascade where losing keystone species triggers domino effects throughout entire ecosystems, unraveling connections we don't even fully understand yet.
300. Costa Rica reversed deforestation through payments for ecosystem services, and some Indigenous groups in Brazil use satellites and drones to patrol their territories—these models work but need massive scaling up immediately.
301. Yeah, well, it's one of those changes that I guess feels inevitable but still basically breaks my heart every time another one closes—they were these magical spaces where you could discover worlds you didn't know existed.
302. That place was special—I spent entire afternoons there in college, sitting on those worn carpets between the philosophy and poetry sections, feeling like I'd found some secret sanctuary from the world.
303. Reading continues, sure, but we've lost something profound about browsing physical shelves, stumbling across unexpected titles, having booksellers who knew your taste and could recommend that perfect obscure novel you'd never find through an algorithm.
304. Hmm, algorithms show you what the thing is, they think you want based on past behavior, but kind of miss the serendipity of wandering into the wrong section and finding exactly what you needed without knowing you were looking for it.
305. I do, honestly, though it feels uh, increasingly like an act of resistance, anyway—holding a book, smelling the pages, seeing it on your shelf as a physical reminder of where your mind has traveled.
306. Maybe it is romantic, right so, but it's just that human culture has always been about more than really pure information—we need rituals, spaces, tactile experiences that connect us to ideas in ways screens can't replicate.
307. That generational shift feels like watching a slow-motion farewell to something irreplaceable—future generations won't miss what they never knew, but we're witnessing the end of a five-hundred-year relationship between humans and printed books.
308. Libraries are evolving into community centers, which serves important needs, but their quiet corners for solitary reading keep shrinking—another refuge from the constant digital noise gradually disappearing.
309. That gives me hope, though I can't help feeling [very sad] it might be like those last video rental stores—brave but temporary monuments to what we're losing rather than signs of any real revival.
310. We already regret it, ah, I think—we're just basically too deep in the transition to turn back, well, watching something beautiful fade while telling ourselves progress always comes with loss.
311. The numbers are definitely wild—a basic sedan starts at thirty-two thousand now, but here's the thing, we can work with monthly payments that make it feel less painful, maybe four-fifty a month?
312. Well, that's with, you know, zero down and uhh, a seven-year term at, I mean, eight-point-nine percent APR—the total comes to thirty-seven thousand eight hundred, but honestly, who's counting when you're driving off the lot today?
313. Interest adds up, but think about it this way—that's only twenty-three dollars extra per month compared to the base price, and you get to keep your savings intact for emergencies or investments.
314. Oh, the twenty-sixteen with, um, seventy-two thousand miles? [mocking] That's actually, you know, priced at twenty-nine nine after the er, certification fee, and honestly, the warranty only covers powertrain for another twelve months.
315. For an extra three thousand nine hundred, we can extend that warranty to sixty months bumper-to-bumper, which brings your total to thirty-three nine—might as well get the new one at that point, right?
316. Let me simplify—new car at thirty-two, you're looking at five hundred twelve monthly with our best rate at five-point-nine percent if you put down four thousand today.
317. Zero down is absolutely possible, just changes the math—your payment jumps to six twenty-eight monthly, but hey, keeping cash liquid in this economy might be worth that extra hundred sixteen per month.
318. I can, well, go to thirty-one two if you, uhh, finance through us, but here's the thing, that's eating into the eight hundred dealer cash that's already, you know, baked into the advertised price.
319. The thirty-two is after manufacturer rebates of [shouting] twenty-two hundred, so technically the MSRP is thirty-four two, but we're playing with about fourteen hundred in wiggle room here!
320. Exactly, but honestly, between trade-in value, so, let's say six thousand for your current car, and uhh, our financing incentives, you know, your out-of-pocket could be as low as twenty-five eight—numbers are just tools to get you driving.
321. Well, that's certainly, uhh, an interesting angle, but I mean, social enterprises typically focus on addressing societal problems while, you know, generating revenue—how exactly would clown employment solve a social issue?
322. Actually, if you're, um, serious about this, [crying while speaking] there's real data showing that, err, performing artists face seventy percent higher unemployment than, you know, the general workforce—but we'd need a sustainable business model beyond just hiring them.
323. So, combining tech education with, uhh, physical performance could actually, I mean, tap into kinesthetic learning methods that, well, some people respond to better than traditional teaching—there's research on this from MIT.
324. No no, they study embodied cognition and [extremely happy] how physical movement enhances cognitive function—juggling specifically has been shown to increase gray matter in the brain, which could theoretically improve programming abilities!
325. That's, hmm, actually touching on something [very slowly] real—studies show that, you know, artistic expression can help process trauma and, uhh, difficult information more effectively than direct verbal communication sometimes does.
326. Social enterprise often starts with [long pause] seemingly absurd ideas that address real needs—Grameen Bank started with the "crazy" idea of lending money to people with no collateral, now it's revolutionized microfinance globally.
327. Well, I mean, both challenge conventional thinking about, uhh, [mocking] who deserves economic opportunity, though admittedly your, sort of, circus performer angle is significantly more niche than, you know, rural poverty alleviation.
328. Funny you mention that because [very slowly] costume and equipment costs are genuine barriers to entry in performance arts—a basic professional clown kit costs three to five thousand dollars, creating real economic exclusion.
329. Professional performance gear includes specialized makeup that won't sweat off, custom-fitted costumes for safety during acrobatics, props built to specific weight distributions—it's actually a significant capital investment most people can't afford upfront.
330. Strange as it sounds, reducing barriers to creative professions through equipment financing could genuinely create jobs, support mental health through laughter therapy, and preserve cultural traditions—sometimes the best social enterprises start as jokes.
331. So, when Spotify launched their Premium tier, they actually discovered that exclusive experiences drive more revenue than the core product—this backstage meet-and-greet plus studio session creates what Marc Andreessen calls "experience moat" around our brand.
332. Well, it's not just five minutes—you're getting honestly two hours of studio access where Paul McCartney recorded "Band on the Run," plus dinner at the same table where Beyoncé signed her Parkwood Entertainment deals, creating what we call aspirational proximity value.
333. The psychological principle here is what Brian Chesky from Airbnb calls "belonging anywhere"—you're not buying a seat, you're buying entry into a narrative that includes music royalty, which transforms you from consumer to participant in cultural history.
334. Tesla's Founders Series, hmm, proved that super-premium tiers can kind of represent forty percent of profit margin despite being less than two percent of unit sales—our data shows similar patterns with these experiences.
335. That's why we structure it, uh, like how Netflix handles content availability—anyway, you get credits worth one-point-five times the value, plus guaranteed rebooking priority, turning potential disappointment into future engagement opportunity.
336. Our head of experience [quickly] design worked at Disney Imagineering, then helped MasterClass develop their pricing strategy—she basically applied what Clayton Christensen called "jobs to be done" framework to identify that people hire VIP experiences for identity construction, not entertainment.
337. Right so, when Supreme drops a limited edition, the thing is they're selling belonging to an in-group—Harvard Business School documented this phenomenon showing luxury experiences create stronger brand loyalty than luxury products by about thirty-seven percent.
338. Look, Coachella VIP [bored] packages run twenty thousand dollars and sell out in minutes because, as Seth Godin writes, people pay premium prices for stories they can tell about themselves—we're just productizing that same human need.
339. We've moved eighty-seven packages [loudly] this quarter alone, beating what Eventbrite's data suggested for our market size—turns out their product-market fit analysis underestimated how much people value curated exclusivity in live experiences.
340. Y Combinator teaches that product-market fit means people buying something you're embarrassed to charge for—we tripled our initial price after the first weekend sold out in six hours, and demand actually increased rather than decreased.
341. Oh gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that—how old is he, and um, what kind of activities did he enjoy before? I mean, there are actually incredible adaptive sports programs that might really help him through this transition.
342. That's actually, you know, [confidently] perfect timing because wheelchair basketball is one of the most developed adaptive sports out there—has anyone, er, mentioned the Junior Paralympic programs to your family yet?
343. Really? Okay so, let me tell you about this program I volunteer with—we basically match kids with mentors who've been through similar experiences, and honestly, watching them discover what they're still capable of is just incredible.
344. That's completely normal, and here's the thing, we usually start with virtual meetings first—would he maybe be open to just, uh, watching some Paralympic highlights or talking to another teen who's been where he is?
345. Anger is actually a healthy [exhausted] part of processing this—my friend Marcus lost his leg at seventeen and said being furious was what eventually pushed him to prove everyone wrong about what he could do.
346. Marcus just qualified for the national, uh, track and field team—he runs the hundred meters faster now than he did before his accident, which kind of blows people's minds when they hear it.
347. The technology in prosthetics has advanced incredibly—but more importantly, would your nephew want to meet Marcus? He loves talking to kids who are just starting their adaptive sports journey.
348. What city are you in, because there's [curious] this amazing adaptive sports expo coming up where kids can, er, try everything from rock climbing to surfing—would your family maybe want to attend together?
349. Denver has one of the best, hmm, adaptive sports communities in the country! The National Sports Center for the Disabled is right there—have you heard about their, basically, free equipment loan program?
350. That's unfortunately really common, but listen, I'm going to, uh, send you all the contact information—the thing is, once your nephew connects with other kids going through this, everything changes, honestly.
351. Oh that's infuriating! The worst part isn't even the theft—it's the gaslighting, like you're crazy for noticing your yogurt magically vanished into the void.
352. That's hilariously bold! Next she'll claim you're imagining your entire grocery list while she's literally holding your sandwich. Some people really think we're all living in their personal buffet dimension.
353. Okay that's evil genius territory but also potentially a felony, so maybe we workshop some alternatives that won't land you in court? Though I absolutely understand the temptation.
354. So, you could, hmm, get a mini fridge with a lock, or—here's the thing—start labeling everything with really, actually, specific descriptions like "Sarah's tuna sandwich she's saving for lunch Tuesday."
355. True, true. Then you escalate to the shame campaign—take photos of your food, send them to her with timestamps, create a whole evidence trail of your ownership.
356. Right so, honestly, if reasonable conversation failed, I mean, maybe it's time to, basically, privilege your own needs over keeping the peace? You deserve to have your food respected in your own home.
357. That's rich coming from someone who's [bitter] apparently too broke to buy her own yogurt but not too proud to steal yours. The audacity is almost impressive if it weren't so pathetically selfish.
358. Well, that's one option, but, you know, why should you, actually, uproot your life because, er, she can't grasp basic boundaries? This is a her problem, not a you problem.
359. Hey, confrontation sucks but you're literally paying rent to store food for someone else right now. That's not avoiding conflict—that's subsidizing her grocery bill while she privileges her appetite over your rights.
360. Because it is insane! Look, anyway, you deserve roommates who can, like, differentiate between their groceries and yours—it's, honestly, kindergarten-level stuff, really.
361. Oh that sounds amazing! I actually tried a key lime version last month and the trick is to add a little extra sugar since limes are way more tart than lemons—have you worked with lime zest before?
362. The thing is, lime zest can be, uhh, pretty intense in baked goods, so you know, I usually start with about three-quarters of what the recipe calls for and, well, adjust from there.
363. Great question! Since lime juice is more acidic, I typically reduce it by about a tablespoon and add a splash of milk to balance things out—otherwise your cake might not rise properly.
364. Yeah, baking chemistry is wild! Last week I forgot to adjust for altitude at my sister's place in Colorado and my beautiful soufflé turned into this sad, deflated pancake situation.
365. Croissants are so finicky though! The butter temperature has to be, uh, [clearing throat] perfect, and honestly, even professional bakers mess them up sometimes—did you try the envelope fold method or the traditional way?
366. That's ambitious! I've been too intimidated to try croissants from scratch, but my neighbor swears by freezing the dough for fifteen minutes between each fold to keep everything at the right temperature.
367. Never rush laminated dough! I learned that the, umm, [passionately] hard way with puff pastry—the butter just melts into the dough instead of creating those, like, gorgeous flaky layers we're after.
368. That's exactly what most French bakeries do! They make the dough one day, do the lamination the next morning when it's coolest, and then proof and bake—it's a whole process.
369. Girl, macarons humbled me so fast! First batch looked like sad little pancakes, second batch exploded in the oven, but third time was the charm—age your egg whites overnight, that's the secret.
370. I know it sounds strange, but aging them at room temperature breaks down the proteins just enough to give you that perfect shiny shell and those cute little feet on the bottom—trust me on this one.
371. Oh honey, I can see why that would be confusing! I do adjust how I present myself in different contexts, but it's not about being dishonest—it's more about highlighting different facets of who I am depending on the situation.
372. I hear you, and I get why it feels that way. Think of it like this though—you probably don't talk to your grandmother the same way you talk to your best friend, right? We all have different sides.
373. You're right, that part was [very melancholic] wrong, and I shouldn't have embellished my education. I was insecure about fitting in with all those Ivy League folks, and I made a mistake that I genuinely regret.
374. Well, the education thing was, uhh, definitely wrong, but like, the rest of it—my interests, my personality, basically, my values—those are all real, just emphasized differently.
375. That's fair, and, hmm, I understand why your trust is shaken, you know. Building it back will take time, but I promise to be more transparent about, actually, these kinds of choices moving forward.
376. Being yourself is, well, [trailing off] more complicated than it sounds... Look, I grew up code-switching between cultures, and sometimes I genuinely don't know which version is the "real" me—they all feel authentic in different ways.
377. It really can be! But it's also given me this ability to connect with lots of different people, to understand multiple perspectives—there's beauty in that flexibility even if it sometimes gets messy.
378. I respect that view, and, er, maybe for you, consistency across all contexts feels, sort of, more authentic—that's totally valid! We just, you know, navigate identity differently, and that's okay.
379. You're absolutely right that I need to be more careful about not crossing into actual deception. The line between adapting and misleading can get blurry, and I've definitely stumbled across it before.
380. That's, um, really sweet of you to say, actually. Maybe with time and, well, the right people like you, I'll feel safe enough to, er, let all my walls down completely.
381. Well, I've been, I mean, diving pretty [over confidently] deep into it actually! The whole field of neuroplasticity is absolutely blowing my mind—like how our brains can literally rewire themselves throughout our entire lives, not just in childhood.
382. My grandmother's dementia diagnosis got me [loudly] thinking about memory formation! I started researching hippocampal function and now I'm completely hooked on understanding how memories get encoded and retrieved—it's like unlocking the secrets of who we are.
383. It is, hmm, devastating honestly, and the thing is, [cry loudly] watching her forget us makes me desperate, kind of, to understand what's happening in her brain—maybe if I learn enough, I can find ways to connect with her still.
384. The research is [empathetically] actually helping me process everything. Did you know that emotional memories are stored differently than regular ones? The amygdala strengthens them, which is why she still remembers songs from her youth but not what she had for breakfast.
385. Exactly! But honestly, the doctors are, err, being [furious] so dismissive about alternative approaches—it's just that they won't even consider music therapy or sensory stimulation protocols that have shown promise in recent studies!
386. Well, the medical establishment can be, sort of, resistant to newer findings—but actually, there's this amazing study from MIT about 40Hz light therapy that's showing incredible results in mice models for clearing amyloid plaques.
387. Not an expert yet, but I'm learning so much! Like how the default mode network in our brains is what creates our sense of self, and when it breaks down in Alzheimer's, that's when people lose their personal narrative.
388. I've been considering it, but [mumbling] the prerequisites are intense—I'd need organic chemistry, physics, calculus... Though there are some incredible computational neuroscience programs that might be more accessible given my coding background.
389. Thank you for saying that—I just [pause] wish I'd started learning this sooner. Maybe if I'd understood the early warning signs, the sundowning, the spatial disorientation, we could have intervened earlier with cognitive exercises or dietary changes.
390. You're right, and actually, this journey is, well, teaching me that the brain is, uhh, remarkably resilient—even damaged neural pathways can sometimes find alternative routes, which gives me hope for finding new ways to connect with her.
391. Oh yeah, I mean, I've been getting really into it, actually! The whole affordable housing crisis thing is basically everywhere right now, and I've been reading about how some cities are experimenting with different zoning reforms to address it.
392. My roommate actually works at a nonprofit that does tenant advocacy, and hearing her stories just opened my eyes! Plus we're seeing friends getting priced out of neighborhoods left and right, which makes it all feel super immediate and real.
393. Totally! And what's fascinating is how interconnected everything is—like housing policy affects transportation, education access, environmental justice, basically everything. Once you start pulling on that thread, you realize how much power local policy has to shape people's entire lives.
394. I joined this student coalition that [shy] meets every Thursday! We're working on pushing the city council to consider inclusionary zoning requirements for new developments, though I'm still learning all the technical terminology and procedures.
395. It's actually not as [loudly] intimidating as it seems! Most of the work is just showing up to meetings, sending emails, and talking to neighbors about what they need—the experienced folks are super welcoming and patient with newcomers.
396. Well, we got like three council members to, you know, [loudly] publicly support our proposal, which is huge! And honestly, we organized this community forum last month where, um, over 200 residents showed up to share their housing stories.
397. Right? And the thing is, once people realize they're not alone in struggling, er, they get fired up about demanding change—like, seeing that collective energy is what keeps me motivated even when progress feels super slow.
398. Absolutely! I'm actually considering law school now specifically to focus on housing policy and tenant rights. There's this whole world of policy work that I never knew existed before, and it feels like somewhere I could make a real difference.
399. It really is life-changing to discover work that feels meaningful! Plus the people in this space are incredible—former organizers, housing lawyers, urban planners—all working together toward making cities more equitable and livable.
400. Yes, please come! We always need more voices, and honestly just having bodies in the room when we present to city council makes such a difference—politicians really do notice when rooms are packed with engaged constituents.
401. [exhausted] Stop torturing yourself about this because the jury, [bitter], made their decision and nothing you say at, [hollow], graduation is going to change what they, [defeated], think they saw that night.
402. [tired] My lawyer says appeals take years and cost, [quietly], thousands of dollars my family doesn't have after paying for the, [cracking], first trial. [sighs heavily]
403. Well, you don't understand what it's like in here when, umm, people find out you're trying to, [weary], overturn your conviction—they think you're weak or, like, playing the system and, [darkly], make your life hell.
404. [whispered] That was different.
405. [angry] You think I haven't replayed that night a thousand times wondering why I was even, [haunted], there at the exact wrong moment when someone else's, [broken], crime became my life sentence?
406. [stunned] How did you find security footage that my own lawyer couldn't, [disbelief], locate during discovery?
407. [overwhelmed] You've been investigating this for months while studying for finals and preparing your, [grateful], speech and nobody even asked you to do, [tearful], any of this for me.
408. [resolved] Then help me file that appeal because I'm finally ready to, [brave], fight this conviction instead of accepting it.
409. Um, when you give that speech tomorrow, I mean, tell them that real perseverance isn't just, [emotional], enduring injustice but having the courage to, [strong], challenge it even when you're terrified.
410. [brave] Tell them about us—how friendship can survive even when the, [proud], system tries to break it and how truth, like, always finds a way to surface even from the darkest, [hopeful], places where they bury it. [voice breaking]
411. [startled] Holy shit, you're actually, [trembling], standing there in the booth where you, [voice cracking], died forty-three years ago, aren't you?
412. Your family hired me to, um, supervise the posthumous album but I mean, [overwhelmed], I never expected to actually encounter you here, [shaking], still trying to finish what you started.
413. [gentle] The master tapes have this, [careful], seventeen-second gap where you stopped singing and just, [heavy], breathed into the microphone before the engineer found you, [breaking], collapsed in the booth. [voice cracks]
414. [moved] So you've been trapped here, um, trying to sing a song about, I mean, death while already being, [awed], dead for four decades?
415. [soft] Well, um, okay then.
416. [determined] I've spent twenty years helping artists find their, [passionate], voice in life, so maybe I can help you find yours in, [reverent], death, even if it means recording something nobody else will, [trembling], believe is real.
417. [fierce] Let them think whatever they, [defiant], want—this is about completing your legacy, not about, [emotional], their narrow understanding of what's possible. [steadying]
418. [focused] Then we'll work through the night using the, [excited], original board you recorded on, mixing your spectral voice with the, [breathless], unfinished tracks until we capture what you've been trying to, [determined], sing all these years. [exhales]
419. [smiling] I've worked with enough tortured artists to know that, [knowing], death doesn't always stop the music—sometimes it just, [profound], changes the frequency.
420. [resolute] So let's make history by recording the first posthumous collaboration that's, [inspired], actually posthumous.
421. [surprised] Well, um, you shouldn't be out here alone in this storm, kid—come on, [gentle], into the barn, I mean, you know, where it's warm and dry.
422. [reassuring] That's good advice your teacher gave you, and you're, [warm], safe here until we can find your group—the cows are, [chuckling], friendly company too.
423. Well, um, that one there is Buttercup, she's the, [fond], gentlest soul you'll ever meet, and she loves, [smiling], visitors, especially little ones who aren't, [soft], afraid of her size, you know. [chuckles softly]
424. Sure you can, um, just move real slow and let her, [instructive], smell your hand first, well, like this, you know.
425. [nostalgic] My daughter used to say the exact same thing when she was about, [wistful], your age. [long pause]
426. [quiet] Well, um, she's been gone a long time now, but I mean, [tender], watching you with Buttercup brings back some really, [emotional], nice memories, you know.
427. [gentle] Don't be sorry, sweetheart, um, it's actually nice to see someone young, [brightening], enjoying the animals again, well, you know.
428. [touched] That's a beautiful thought, and you know what, um, I think, [tearful], your grandma must be a very wise woman to teach you something so, [warm], special, and I mean, maybe you're right about my little girl watching over us. [sighs peacefully]
429. [encouraging] Well, um, that's a wonderful dream to have, and I mean, you've already got the most important thing which is, [sincere], a kind heart, you know. [chuckles warmly]
430. [understanding] Well, um, you're welcome back anytime your class comes this way, and I mean, [hopeful], Buttercup would love to see her new friend again, and, [soft], maybe I could teach you how to milk a cow properly, you know, if your teacher says it's okay. [smiles warmly]
431. [extremely happy] God, I just—I can't believe they're actually saying that about my work. You know, um, when I was painting those clouds behind the cemetery scene, I mean, [slowly] I must've repainted that sky like forty times. [laugh] Seriously, forty! The director kept saying it needed to feel more, er, "emotionally weighted," whatever that meant. [pause] But then I thought, well, what if the clouds kind of mirror what she's feeling? Like, [passionately] not just background, but actually part of her grief, you know? 

[warm] So I started adding these really subtle color shifts—basically, purples bleeding into grays, and then, [whispering] just the tiniest hint of gold where the light breaks through. [gasp softly] And honestly, when I saw it on screen with the actors, I just... [crying while speaking] I didn't expect to feel so much, you know? Here's the thing—I've painted hundreds of backgrounds, but this one, [very sincerely] this one actually made people cry. My mom called me sobbing about that scene! [laugh loudly] Can you believe that? 

[relieved] All those years studying classic paintings, and it turns out, um, they actually prepared me for this exact moment. [sigh] I guess backgrounds aren't so invisible after all.
432. [very melancholic] She left the ring on the kitchen counter. Right next to my harness, actually. [pause] I keep staring at it like it's gonna, um, tell me something I don't already know. [bitter] Twenty years of climbing towers, rigging stages, hanging off buildings—and for what? [sigh] The money was good, I mean, really good when you're working those high-risk jobs. [regretful] But I was never here. Always in Dubai, or Hong Kong, or... [trailing off] wherever the next impossible job was. [frustrated] She used to say "be careful" every morning, and I'd just—I'd laugh it off, you know? [very sad] Like it was nothing. [long pause] The Petronas Towers gig, that storm in Seattle, the scaffolding collapse in Miami... [shaky voice] I almost died three times last year alone. Three times. [cry] And she was here, just... waiting. [whispering] Always waiting for that phone call. [upset] I chose the adrenaline over breakfast together. [very slowly] Chose the crew over family dinners. [crying while speaking] God, when did I become the guy who misses every anniversary because there's a concert rig in Tokyo? [sniffle] The ring's still sitting there. [very quietly] Right where she left it.
433. [mumbling] Just replacing these old pipes, same as always—wait, what the... [curious] There's something behind this wall panel. Um, these look like... are these newspapers? [gasp softly] 1863? Holy—these are Civil War era. And there's more stuff, like, there's a whole cache back here. [excited] Oh my God, there's letters! Actual handwritten letters tied with ribbon, and they're talking about... [slowly] the Underground Railroad. This building was a station. [pause] We've been—I've been walking through history this whole time, you know? Just doing my regular maintenance and never knowing. [anxious] I need to call someone, but who? The historical society? The owner's gonna flip when they find out. [laugh] Actually no, they'll be thrilled—this changes everything. We're not just some old building anymore. [overwhelmed] I mean, landmark status means no more renovations without approval, no more quick fixes. [sigh] Everything I do here is gonna be different now. But honestly? [warm] These people risked everything to help others escape. They hid them right here, where I'm standing. [very quietly] And I'm the one who found their story. After 160 years in the dark, I—a maintenance guy just trying to fix a leak—I brought them back into the light. [emotional] That's... that's something, isn't it?
434. [relieved] We won. We actually—God, we won. [pause] Three years of my life, and the judge just... [very slowly] "Ruling in favor of the plaintiff." [laugh] I keep hearing those words over and over. [emotional] Do you know what this means? I mean, really means? 

[excited] Every single person who's been through what I went through, they can point to this case now—our case—and say [passionately] "See? Someone fought back and won." [sniffle] Sorry, I'm just... um, the attorney said there's already inquiries coming in, like, hundreds of them. [warm] People who thought they'd never have a chance.

[shaky voice] When they denied my claim the first time, I honestly thought that was it, you know? [bitter] "Insufficient evidence," they said. [laugh loudly] Insufficient! After everything I documented, every single medical report, every— [pause] But we kept going. [confidently] And now it's case law. Actual precedent.

[very sincerely] Those executives have to change their entire policy because of what we did today. [whispering] Thousands of families won't have to suffer in silence anymore. [cry] I just wish Mom could've seen this. [slowly] She always said, "You don't back down when you're right." [extremely happy] We didn't back down, Mom. We didn't.
435. They actually did it. They actually—oh my God, [gasp softly] the bonus came through for everyone. I mean, I knew the efficiency numbers were good, but like... thirty percent improvement in throughput? That's, um, that's not nothing. [excited] And Marissa just told me the whole bindery team is getting the quarterly bonus because of it!

The thing is, I honestly didn't even—[short pause] well, okay, I guess I did work pretty hard on reorganizing the workflow stations. But you know, it was just so obvious once I started tracking where the bottlenecks were happening. [animated] Like, why were we moving completed stacks three times before shipping? That's just—anyway, er, I streamlined all that.

[nervous] What if they think I'm showing off though? I mean, Carlos has been there for fifteen years and here I come with my—no, actually, [relieved] Carlos was the first one to congratulate me. He said, uh, he said he'd been wanting someone to fix that system for ages.

[very sincerely] It feels really good, you know? Not just the money—though obviously that's amazing—but like, everyone benefits. The whole team. [smiling speaking] We're going out for drinks Friday to celebrate, and honestly? I kind of can't wait to buy the first round.
436. [confused] What? No, that's—hang on, what are you saying? [pause] You're telling me that, um, for months? Like actual months? [shaky voice] I don't—hold on, Sarah saw them where? At the hotel by—[gasp loudly] oh my God. Oh my God, that conference. [bitter] The conference I helped them pack for, right? The one where I literally, I mean, I drove them to the airport and—[laugh] this is insane. [furious] How many people knew? Hmm? How many of our friends just, er, watched me be an idiot? [very sad] I keep thinking about last week when they said—God, when they said they loved me and I actually—[cry] I believed it. [pause] You know what the worst part is? Like, honestly? [angry] I had this feeling, you know? This weird gut thing where something felt off but I kept telling myself I was being paranoid, that I was—[stuttering] th-that I was the problem. [sniffle] All those late nights at work weren't work, were they? [very quietly] I'm such a fool. I mean, basically everyone could see it except me. [crying while speaking] What am I supposed to do now? Just go home and pretend I don't know while I figure out how to—[trailing off] I can't even think straight.
437. [formal] Actually, this is a, [confused], professional call from DataPoint Research and I'm conducting a, [clearing throat], brief survey about consumer preferences in the, [hesitantly], service industry.
438. [overly polite] I understand it's, um, late but we're trying to, [anxious], reach people during their free time and, well, this should only take, [quickly], about fifteen minutes if you're willing to participate. [cough]
439. [stuttering] Wait, that voice sounds, um, familiar and I'm, [shocked], starting to think maybe this isn't, uhh, the right number because you sound exactly, [whispering], like someone I used to know really well.
440. [shaky voice] Sarah, oh my god, um, it's really you isn't it, I mean, [gasp softly], I recognize your voice now.
441. [apologetic] It was random, I swear, um, the computer just generates numbers and I had, [crying while speaking], no idea you were doing this kind of, er, work now. [sniffle]
442. [empathetically] No, Sarah, please, I've been, [regretful], trying to find you for months because mom's sick and she's been, [very sad], asking about you every single day and wanting to make things right.
443. [warm] That was dad's decision and mom, [passionately], fought him on it but she was too weak then to stand up to him properly.
444. Please just give me, [desperate], five minutes to explain everything that's happened since you left.
445. [relieved] Thank you, and I want you to know that, [very sincerely], whatever you're doing to survive, I'm not here to judge because we both know I've, [whispering loudly], made my own mistakes. [deep breath]
446. [very slowly] She has cancer, Sarah, and the doctors say she only has, [voice breaking], a few months left.
447. That voice sounds, [stunned], familiar even after, well, fifteen years of, [bitter], silence and now you come here, um, needing something from these weathered hands. [pause]
448. [cold] Well, um, heroes don't visit saddlers, I mean.
449. [resigned] Bring her in, um, then.
450. This workshop used to echo with your laughter before you decided, [melancholic], that becoming a legend mattered more than the family business your grandfather built with, [exhausted], these same tools I still use every morning. [sigh]
451. Your mother would have recognized this mare's bloodline immediately because she bred, [nostalgic], the grandmother of this very horse you're so desperate to save, [warm], in our old stables before the fire took everything.
452. So, um, this poison you mentioned, well, it's actually hemlock mixed with wolfsbane, [analytical], a combination meant to kill slowly and painfully, I mean.
453. Heroes chase glory while, [bitter], craftsmen learn to read the language of suffering in every, [tired], creature that limps through their door.
454. The antidote requires three drops of morning dew from, um, cemetery grass mixed with, [slowly], crushed sage and the blood of someone who truly loves her, well, more than their own life. [cough]
455. [softly] Your hands shake the same way mine did when I tried to, [vulnerable], save your mother's horse thirty years ago using this exact remedy.
456. [gently] Perhaps.
457. [defensive] Mr. Harrison signed all the, [calm], necessary documents three weeks ago when his diagnosis became, [quieter], terminal and time-sensitive arrangements had to be, [measured], made immediately. [sighs]
458. [bitter] False hope? [scoffs]
459. [steady] What you call science fiction is, [passionate], advancing every year with new vitrification techniques that minimize, [earnest], cellular damage and preserve neural structures better than we've ever, [hopeful], achieved before. [pause]
460. She knows about, [careful], his decision and supports it because she understands, [softer], this is his only chance at seeing her children grow up.
461. [firm] But might, [emotional], someday when revival becomes possible and he could wake to a world where his cancer is curable.
462. [philosophical] Death used to mean when the, [contemplative], heart stopped beating until we learned to restart them, then it meant, [intense], brain death until we discovered neural plasticity could recover from what we thought was, [trailing off], irreversible.
463. [urgent] That's why we need to work, [pleading], together because the window between legal death and cellular degradation is, [desperate], measured in minutes not hours and every second we argue is, [pained], neural tissue he'll never recover. [long pause]
464. [gentle] We're not playing, [sincere], God—we're just pressing pause on the inevitable, [tender], hoping someone smarter than us figures out how to press play again. [sighs heavily]
465. [relieved] Four hours from the moment his heart, [technical], stops to full vitrification if everything goes perfectly, [tense], but we need your help navigating the legal documentation to make it, [determined], legitimate.
466. [grateful] Thank you for giving him, [emotional], this chance even if you don't believe in it—hope is sometimes all we, [choked up], have left to offer. [pause]
467. You can't be the same, um, [stunned], sheep from the children's petting area, I mean, [voice breaking], that was fifteen years ago and you were already, well, [disbelief], fully grown back then.
468. [shaking] This is, umm, [overwhelmed], impossible—they said you went to a farm upstate, but here you are in the, well, [horrified], auction pen for the slaughterhouse buyers, you know?
469. [desperate] My father never told me you were still, [anguished], here all these years. [chokes up]
470. [frantic] But I manage the concessions now, and, um, [determined], I have savings, you know?
471. [whispered] I can't, well... [trails off]
472. There has to be something I can, [desperate], do to stop this. [sobs]
473. [breaking] You understood every word I said back then, [realization], didn't you, and you've been, [guilt-ridden], waiting here all this time.
474. [fierce] I'm buying you myself, um, [determined], right now, and I don't care what it costs or, well, [defiant], what my father says about it, you know? [steadies]
475. [sobbing] I should have come back sooner, [regretful], should have asked about you, should have, [broken], known they were lying about the farm upstate.
476. [hollow] I'll never forgive myself for, [devastated], this.
477. [defiant] I know who you are.
478. [bitter] You're wearing her face but you're not, [trembling], my sister—I've watched you practice her, [hollow], smile in the mirrors for weeks while she's been, [breaking], gone.
479. Since the accident, um, three months ago when they said she needed, [quiet], time to recover but then you showed up pretending to, well, be her.
480. [pleading] Everyone keeps lying to me about where she, [desperate], really is and whether she's even still, [voice cracking], alive anymore.
481. [stunned] I need to know the truth about what, um, happened to Maya—is she in some hospital somewhere or did she, well, actually die that night? [chokes]
482. [angry] They replaced her like she was just some, [disgusted], broken toy instead of letting her fans know the, [shaking], truth about what happened.
483. [crying] But I just want my sister back, um, not some perfect illusion of who she, [broken], used to be—I don't care if she can't, well, perform anymore, I just need to, [desperate], see her again. [sobs]
484. You'd really risk your, [surprised], job for me?
485. [determined] I'm going to see her tomorrow no matter what my, [fierce], parents say—will you help me figure out how to, [hopeful], get there without them knowing?
486. [grateful] Thank you for being the only, [relieved], honest person in this whole nightmare.
487. [cold] I've been walking dogs in this park for years and I've, [bitter], noticed you here before with different, [quietly], women who aren't your wife. [pause]
488. You know, um, Sarah shows me pictures of you two at church every Sunday looking, [disappointed], perfect together like nothing's wrong.
489. [anxious] The dogs always bark when they see you because they can, [confused], sense something dishonest about people who live, [slowly], double lives like this.
490. [doubtful] Well, um, paying for intimacy doesn't seem like, [frustrated], the kind of connection that's going to, [empathetically], fix whatever's broken inside you, I mean, [sigh]
491. [warm] I've watched you do this for months and each time you leave looking, [sad], more lost than when you arrived like you're, [passionately], searching for something that money can't, [very slowly], actually buy. [long pause]
492. Er, maybe not, but um, I understand watching my father do the same thing and seeing how it, [upset], destroyed my mother when she found out.
493. [stern] Well, um, every Tuesday when I walk past your house, er, I see Sarah watering those roses alone and I wonder if she's, [melancholic], dying inside too while you're here seeking, [clearing throat], comfort from strangers, you know? [gasp softly]
494. [thoughtful] You know, um, maybe both of you are drowning separately when you could, er, either swim together or at least be, [honest], honest enough to let each other find different, [relieved], shores to heal on. [cough]
495. But continuing this charade while you meet escorts in the park makes those twenty, [firm], years a lie instead of just a, [gently], chapter that needs to end.
496. [modest] That's your truth.
497. [apologetic] I know, um, I mean, I've been, [warm], collecting them for months actually, not to, [anxious], throw them away but because, well, [very quietly], they're about someone I used to know.
498. [crying while speaking] The man you write about, [empathetically], he's my father who died working at that factory twenty years ago.
499. [bitter] He used to say dreams were like, [slowly], recycled hopes that kept coming back in different forms until you, [passionately], finally recognized them for what they really were.
500. [very melancholic] Because he said it to me, [gently], every night before bed and somehow you captured his voice, [chuckling], perfectly in those discarded pages. [long pause]
501. [excited] Well, um, he worked the night shift and, [whispering loudly], sometimes he'd come home and watch you playing in the yard next door when you were, [very sincerely], maybe three or four years old, you know? [gasp]
502. [relieved] Um, I mean, he always wondered what happened to that little kid who, [tearfully], used to wave at him through the fence every morning. [sniffles]
503. The stories you throw away are the, [gratefully], only pieces of him I have left besides old photographs that can't, [mumbling], capture his voice the way your, [happily], words somehow do.
504. [hopeful] Every Tuesday when I collect your recycling, [determined], I find another chapter about him teaching someone to fix engines or, [nostalgically], telling stories about the stars and I keep them all, [carefully], preserved in plastic sleeves. [deep breath]
505. [grateful] Three hundred and forty-seven pages to be, [precisely], exact and each one feels like having him back for just a moment.
506. [tearfully joyful] That would mean everything to me and my family who never really, [peacefully], got to say goodbye properly. [cries softly]
507. [confused] Wait, what? I don't—hold on, dismissed? [pause] Like, completely dismissed? You're telling me that, um, two years—two entire years of my life—and it's just... [bitter] gone? Because of what, some filing deadline we missed by, er, three days? [frustrated] Are you actually kidding me right now? I mean, the depositions alone took, you know, six months. Six months! [angry] And the medical records, oh God, the medical records were literally a nightmare to track down. [sarcastic] But sure, yeah, a technicality. That's just—that's perfect. [laugh] You know what? [very loudly] This is insane! My daughter, she still can't, um—[shaky voice] she still has the scars from when that thing basically exploded in her face, and they're saying what? [mocking] "Sorry, paperwork issue"? [long pause] I honestly don't even know how to, like... [exhausted] how do I tell my family? We were so—God, we were actually so close. The lawyer said, er, he said we had them. [very quietly] He promised we had them. [sigh] Two years. All those meetings, all that hope, and it's just... [trailing off] I guess that's it then. [very sad] That's really it.
508. I've been doing this job for, [heavy], fifteen years and I've never had a super come out here to, [quiet], plead with me before.
509. [softly] I understand.
510. [careful] Look, um, I don't make these decisions, I just, [uncomfortable], swing the wrecking ball when the paperwork's signed, and, well, I've learned not to, [tired], think too hard about what I'm knocking down, you know?
511. My grandmother lived in a place like this, [distant], before they tore it down for a shopping mall. [sighs]
512. [struggling] Every building I tear down has ghosts in it—first kisses on, [haunted], fire escapes, babies taking first steps down those hallways, last conversations before someone, [hollow], never came home again. [long pause]
513. I mean, what do you, um, want me to do here—I've got a, [frustrated], crew coming at dawn and a contract that'll bankrupt me if I don't deliver.
514. [conflicted] God, um, you're not making this easy—I've got, well, I've got bills to pay and my own family to, [strained], feed and this job, it's the biggest contract I've, [defeated], landed in two years. [exhales]
515. [resigned] You know the developer already has permits to build luxury condos here that none of, [bitter], your tenants could afford in three lifetimes, and the next demolition company won't, [cold], hesitate like I am.
516. [vulnerable] Um, I stood outside my grandmother's building for, well, three hours before they brought it down, just, [shaking], memorizing every brick and window, and I still, uh, dream about those rooms sometimes. [voice breaks]
517. [decided] I'll tell them there's asbestos—that'll buy you, [steady], three months minimum for remediation paperwork, and maybe by then your tenants can, [hopeful], find somewhere that feels even a little bit like home. [pause]
518. [gentle] Hey, it's okay, I've been doing this, [professional], mediation work for a decade now and honestly, [warm], helping old friends is why I got into this field in the, [careful], first place. [soft exhale]
519. So tell me what's happening with the, [concerned], business partnership because from your message it sounded like things are, [heavy], pretty far gone already, um, am I right about that?
520. [thoughtful] Um, when you say 'she,' I mean, [realizing], are we talking about Sarah, your wife?
521. [compassionate] Oh God, that's, um, incredibly difficult—trying to maintain a, [measured], professional relationship while your personal one is, well, [pained], dissolving must feel like you're being torn in half every single day. [pause]
522. [steady] Listen, I've mediated dozens of, [purposeful], business dissolutions between couples and the hardest part is always separating, [knowing], what needs to be grieved from what needs to be negotiated. [breathes deeply]
523. [giving] Remember when we were kids and you taught me that, [nostalgic], thing about untangling fishing lines?
524. [unified] You said you can't yank at the knots or they, [gentle], get tighter—you have to follow each line patiently to see where it's, [meaningful], actually caught, and that's exactly what we're going to do here. [soft smile in voice]
525. Some lessons stick because they're, [reflective], true about more than what they seem to be about, and right now, well, [focused], you and Sarah have about fifteen tangled lines that we need to separate, um, one at a time. [determined]
526. [assured] Um, well, maybe.
527. [loving] That's what old friends are for—we remember who you, [tender], were before all this and can help you find, [giving], your way back to solid ground.
528. [hollow] That little girl with the, [exhausted], bright red swimsuit who kept saying she could swim like a dolphin until she, [voice cracking], couldn't anymore.
529. [bitter] Well, um, turns out being good at saving others doesn't, I mean, [defeated], teach you how to rescue yourself from the, uhh, darkness that keeps growing.
530. [surprised] Seventeen already, that's, [wistful], impossible to imagine because in my mind she's still that terrified child, [softening], clinging to my neck like I was the only solid thing in an endless ocean. [long sigh]
531. [quiet] Um, well, I can't, uhh, swim anymore.
532. [crying] You don't understand how, um, tired I am of pretending that saving one child, [broken], makes up for all the ones I couldn't reach, and I mean, including my own daughter who, [devastated], died while I was saving someone else's kid, you know?
533. [raw] She was four and had an asthma attack while I was at that lake pulling, [anguished], Emma out of the water.
534. [desperate] But I did choose, didn't I, um, and now every breath I take feels like, [guilty], it was stolen from her, and well, I can't keep breathing air that should have been, [sobbing], hers, you know? [breaks down]
535. Um, maybe, I mean, maybe not.
536. She writes to the stranger who, [disbelief], saved her, even after all this time when most people would have, [touched], forgotten, but somehow she still, [wondering], remembers me? [silence]
537. [weeping] I'm standing here looking at the, [lost], water below and all I can see is her face, not Emma's but my, [shattered], daughter's, asking me why I wasn't there when she, [barely audible], needed me most. [sobs]
538. [exhausted] I got separated from, um, the tour bus after the festival and, well, I've been walking for, [desperate], hours trying to find my way back to, like, civilization or something. [sighs heavily]
539. The music isn't just, [defensive], noise, it's about freedom and expression and connecting with something, [passionate], bigger than yourself. [laughs softly]
540. [surprised] You'd actually help a stranger who's been, [grateful], following a band around like some kind of, [self-deprecating], lost puppy? [sniffles]
541. [curious] Um, well, what happened?
542. [gentle] That's exactly why I keep following the band even when people, [determined], think I'm wasting my life because settling feels like, [fearful], dying slowly from the inside, [trembling], out.
543. So you understand then, um, what it's like to have this, [yearning], hunger for something more while everyone tells you to, well, [frustrated], be practical and, you know, [resigned], grow up already.
544. [encouraging] You could still do it, I mean, there's online courses now and, um, [hopeful], people start new careers at any age these days and, well, [excited], your experience with land would actually, like, make you unique.
545. [firm] The same people who take a groupie seriously when, um, she writes about the music industry for, like, [proud], Rolling Stone under a pseudonym while everyone thinks I'm just, well, another starry-eyed fan.
546. [confident] Three cover stories this year about the intersection of, [passionate], rural America and rock culture, which is exactly why I noticed your, [knowing], Frank Lloyd Wright books through the kitchen window.
547. Well, um, I could use a quiet place to write my book and, you know, [hopeful], you could use someone who believes your sketches deserve to, er, [earnest], become real buildings.
548. [gentle] Still learning. [sighs softly]
549. [measured] Well, umm, the body knows when it's, [drifting], time to let go, even when the mind keeps, er, holding on to what used to be.
550. [weary] Those lessons were meant for moments, umm, [heavy], like this one, though I mean, I never imagined you'd be the one sitting here, well, watching me demonstrate them.
551. [patient] The words were never meant to be, [soft], meaningful—they were meant to be, [distant], bridges across the unbearable spaces.
552. [peaceful] Just having you here is enough, more than enough, [grateful], after all these years of teaching about presence, you're giving me, [tender], the greatest gift by simply being present with me, [fading], right now.
553. Well, um, everything I could teach you is already, [knowing], inside you, like, waiting to bloom when you need it most.
554. You don't need to navigate, [gentle], this—just drift with me for, well, [slowing], a while, like leaves on the same stream, um, [peaceful], going wherever the current takes us. [exhales slowly]
555. [fading] The hardest truths always are, [wise], which is why we spend our whole lives, [patient], practicing for the moment we finally, [drifting], have to live them. [long pause]
556. Every patient you guide will be, [knowing], me teaching through you, every family you comfort will hear, [eternal], my voice in yours.
557. [serene] Never been calmer.
558. [perceptive] There's something, um, familiar about the way you're, [studying], holding yourself right now, like you're ready to run even though, I mean, you're the one being interviewed here. [pause]
559. [stunned] Oh my God, you're the, um, young woman from the shelter who used to, [recognition dawning], reorganize our entire filing system at three in the morning because, well, you couldn't sleep and needed to feel, [emotional], useful somehow. [voice breaking]
560. I mean, Rebecca, right? [exhales]
561. [professional] This creates an interesting ethical situation since I was your, [careful], advocate during such a vulnerable time in your life. [sighs deeply]
562. [gentle] You graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown Law, and, um, your professor's recommendation letter mentions, [impressed], your exceptional work with the campus survivor support clinic, so I mean, you've clearly transformed your, [proud], pain into purpose.
563. [thoughtful] The woman who left our shelter six years ago was, well, broken and terrified, but the person sitting across from me now is, um, radiating this quiet strength that, [moved], honestly takes my breath away.
564. [attentive] The other candidates have more traditional experience, but none of them understand, [knowing], viscerally what it means to rebuild an entire identity after trauma tears it, [careful], apart.
565. I kept the origami crane you made, um, from that legal pad paper, and, well, it's been sitting on my desk, [emotional], reminding me why this work matters every single day for, I mean, eight years now.
566. [professional] If we move forward with your application, we'd need to establish clear, [measured], boundaries and probably have HR involved to ensure everything stays, [careful], appropriate and ethical.
567. [decided] Welcome to the team, counselor, though I suspect you've, [warm], been part of it all along.
568. Look, I document urban, [defensive], transformations for my three million followers who are genuinely, [measured], interested in watching cities evolve and change.
569. [softening] Um, I didn't know.
570. [guilty] The comments section keeps asking for more dramatic angles when the, [quiet], wrecking ball hits but now I'm realizing those walls held, [trailing off], actual memories.
571. [desperate] Um, well, I could stop.
572. But I could tell their, [earnest], stories instead of just showing destruction. [pauses]
573. [sincere] Those three million people who watch me should know what, [determined], we're actually losing here, not just what's, [firm], being torn down. [exhales slowly]
574. Um, I'm, well, sorry. [long pause]
575. [quiet] Well, um, I have this platform and, I mean, millions of people watching so maybe we could, [growing confidence], create something meaningful from this loss.
576. So, um, let's make sure this one haunts people in a way that, [passionate], matters, that makes them think about, [urgent], what we destroy when we call it progress, makes them, [fierce], question every demolition they witness. [voice rising]
577. [resolved] Then we start tomorrow morning before they take down the, [reverent], last wall, before the final pieces of your work, [emotional], disappear, before this becomes just another, [heavy], empty lot waiting for the next thing. [breathes deeply]
578. [quiet] Your father brought them to me every six months for, [tired], maintenance even after he stopped surfing.
579. [lethargic] The '74 Lightning Bolt was his, [measured], favorite, said it reminded him of when you were, [moody], little and he'd carry you on his shoulders after, [nostalgic], dawn patrol sessions. [long pause]
580. [exhausted] Well, um, yeah.
581. [slow] He understood why you left, even if he never, [heavy], said it out loud to you, just to these, [melancholic], boards in my workshop.
582. About you constantly, um, showed me every published paper you sent him, even though he didn't, [proud], understand the statistics, just kept saying his kid was, [wistful], saving lives with math while he shaped foam into, well, dreams. [voice cracks]
583. [gentle] Your father knew the ocean would always be here when you were, [understanding], ready to come back to it.
584. [firm] The ocean remembers.
585. These boards have been waiting for you, just like he was, [patient], waiting even after the cancer took his voice and then, [fading], everything else. [exhales slowly]
586. [soft] He didn't want three more months of hospitals, just wanted to know his boards would find, [certain], their way back to you. [long silence]
587. Tomorrow morning, six a.m., um, dawn patrol, just like he used to, [reverent], do with you, well, before the world got complicated. [sighs]
588. So, um, I guess you weren't, [exhausted], expecting to see me here, I mean, especially not after, [bitter], ten years of nothing, and well, certainly not, [hollow], copying sheet music for your wedding reception.
589. [defensive] Yeah, because staying in that house with Mom's, [sharp], expectations and Dad's constant disappointment was, [trembling], killing me slowly, and you were too busy, [cold], climbing your corporate ladder to even notice.
590. Fair would have been you standing up for me when they, [tired], mocked my music degree instead of joining them with your, [tactless], practical career advice about real jobs.
591. Well, um, growing up doesn't erase what happened, and I mean, [weary], sitting here transcribing love songs for your perfect wedding while you, [sarcastic], pretend I'm just another vendor is pretty much exactly what I expected from you.
592. The investigator was right because being invisible was, [quiet], better than being the family disappointment who chose Bach over business school.
593. Um, Dad's funeral was the hardest day of my life and I, well, [cracking], watched from across the cemetery because showing up would have meant facing all of you.
594. [tired] Cruel was telling me at eighteen that my music was a, [bitter], hobby not a future while you got praised for every mediocre business presentation.
595. [perceptive] You hired me because my portfolio was impressive, right, so maybe, um, [wistful], this hobby turned into something real after all, I mean.
596. [stunned] Um, she does?
597. Well, I, um, don't know what to, er, say.
598. [defensive] Look, um, I mean, the automated systems were supposed to, [nervous], handle the climate regulation and, well, I was dealing with the pest outbreak in, [exhausted], greenhouse B that you said was the priority.
599. [shaking] Well, um, I thought I could manage both situations without, [desperate], causing alarm, and, you know, the repair costs would have blown through our, [trailing off], quarterly budget anyway.
600. [barely audible] I mean, um, I've been working sixteen-hour days trying to, [cracking], save what I could, but the fungal infection spread, [hollow], faster than anyone predicted and, well, once the temperature spiked, [defeated], everything just collapsed. [long pause]
601. [resigned] The investors are pulling out tomorrow after they, [numb], see the quarterly report, and there's no way we can, [broken], recover from losing the entire hybrid tomato line that was supposed to, [flatly], launch next season.
602. [guilty] Every morning I walked past those wilting plants knowing I was, [voice cracking], destroying everything we built, but I kept thinking maybe, [desperate], tomorrow I could fix it somehow.
603. [trembling] I mean, um, I'll take full responsibility when they, [reluctant], call me in tomorrow, but, well, we both know that won't bring back the crops or the jobs we're about to lose.
604. [broken] Well, um, apparently I'm as terrible at this as I was at, [self-loathing], everything else I've tried in my career.
605. The smell of decay in there is so, [nauseated], overwhelming that I can't even walk through without, [gagging], wanting to vomit from the guilt.
606. I know, um, I've already started packing my office because, well, there's no point in, [hollow], pretending I deserve to stay after this.
607. [defeated] Um, for what it's worth, I mean, I never intended for any of this to, [breaking], happen.
608. [subdued] The IRS finally found a reason to, [pause], send you to my door after all this time. [sigh]
609. The kiln teaches you patience in ways that, [regretful], I never learned how to apply to being a parent back then.
610. Your mother said I was poisoning you with my, [trembling], artistic dreams and failures, making you believe in things that would, [very quietly], never pay the bills or provide stability, [trailing off]...
611. [apologetic] The court orders were clear and your mother's lawyer made sure, [monotone], I understood that any attempt at contact would result in, [slowly], legal consequences I couldn't afford.
612. [defeated] After that much time passes, you convince yourself that showing up would cause, [nervously], more harm than staying away. [long pause]
613. [empathetically] You became a tax attorney which means you chose precision and, [formal], rules over the chaos I represented, proving your mother was, [whispering loudly], right about protecting you from me.
614. [curious] The tax issues you mentioned earlier aren't really why you're here, [relieved], are they, because this feels like something you've been, [speeding up], planning for a very long time.
615. [shocked] Uh, you lied, I mean?
616. [tearfully] I knew who you were the moment you walked in because you still tilt your head, [nostalgic], the same way when you're nervous. [cry]
617. [gently] Um, would you like to stay and watch the kiln opening tomorrow morning, because, well, [vulnerable], I'd really like to show you what I've been, [hopefully], creating all these years. [chuckle]
618. [formal] Well, um, you did the right thing bringing the owl here immediately because, [empathetically], most people just, you know, drive away and leave them to suffer. [pause]
619. [monotone] The owl has a fractured wing and, [slowly], internal bruising that will require weeks of, [hesitantly], rehabilitation if it survives the next, [whispering], forty-eight hours.
620. [distant] These things happen.
621. Most honor students who, um, bring in injured animals never call back to check because, [coldly], guilt doesn't fit well with, you know, their achievement narratives.
622. [tired] Look, I've been doing this for, um, twelve years and I've seen every type of person walk through, [passionately], that door with their accidents and their, [very sad], excuses and their promises to, well, help that they never keep.
623. [warm] The rehabilitation process requires daily, [gently], feeding and physical therapy exercises that most volunteers find too demanding.
624. [surprised] You're actually serious about this—I mean, you'd come here every day for, [curious], potentially months to care for an owl that might not even, well, survive? [laugh]
625. [impressed] Well, um, we start feeding at 5 AM and the physical therapy happens, [hopeful], three times daily so if you're really committed, er, I'll teach you how to handle raptors without, [carefully], causing further injury.
626. [thoughtful] You know, um, sometimes the universe creates these collisions between, [philosophically], different worlds to teach us things we didn't know we needed to learn.
627. [gentle] The owl's name is Athena and she's, [softly], a survivor just like you might be if you, [meaningfully], let yourself learn from this experience. [smile]
628. [stern] The building manager said you've been working, [quickly], these late shifts for three weeks now. [pause]
629. [confused] Well, um, the forensics team will need to, [slowly], tear down everything you just installed, which means, er, your work here is compromised and we'll need, [frustrated], to document every layer you put up, you know?
630. [empathetically] Er, your wife—the building records show, um, someone matching her description visited this unit, [trailing off], six months ago before she disappeared, I mean.
631. The security footage we recovered shows her entering this building, [coldly], multiple times over the course of three months, always, [monotone], when you were working your other job across town, and she had, [bitter], a key to this specific unit.
632. Um, I know. [sigh]
633. [regretful] We found her wedding ring embedded in the plaster about, [very melancholic], three feet from where you're standing, along with, [softly], traces of her DNA mixed with someone else's.
634. [apologetic] Well, er, protocol requires that we treat you as, [carefully], a potential suspect until we can verify your alibi, and um, your reaction needed to be, [clinical], documented without prior knowledge, you know? [long pause]
635. The owner of this unit died, [grimly], two weeks after your wife disappeared, supposedly, [suspicious], from a heart attack, but now we're thinking, [darkly], the timeline suggests something else entirely.
636. [gently] The blood you found isn't just your wife's—there's his too, [determined], suggesting they fought each other before, [resigned], both of them died here. [clearing throat]
637. [warm] Your alibi checked out completely—you were, [sympathetic], three states away at your mother's funeral when this happened, which means, [relieved], you're just another victim in this tragedy. [cry softly]
638. [hesitantly] The Vermeer at the private gallery is, [quietly], what he wants and there's no way one person can pull that off alone.
639. [apologetic] Look, um, I know this is, [shaky voice], weird but we were good at this, you know, before everything else got complicated.
640. [embarrassed] That was, um, an accident and you know it wasn't, [mumbling], supposed to happen like that, er, things just got out of hand that night.
641. [warm] Despite everything that happened between us, [suggesting], we could make this work if we just keep it professional this time.
642. [reluctant] That requires complete trust and perfect, [nervous], timing which we haven't had since, you know, everything fell apart between us.
643. [resigned] Fine, um, but we need to establish some ground rules like, [formal], no talking about the past and definitely no, well, getting personal again. [groan]
644. [excited] Wait, you still have those blueprints we, um, made together because I thought you, [surprised], burned everything after we split, I mean, that's what you said you were going to do.
645. [flirtatious] You know, um, we always did make an incredible team when we weren't, [playful], trying to kill each other over something stupid, er, maybe we could actually pull this off. [chuckle]
646. [determined] Then we better start tonight because the longer we wait, [trailing off], the more complicated this gets and we both know how that usually... [long pause]
647. [accepting] I'll be there but just remember this is, [firmly], strictly business and after we deliver the painting to Marcus we go our separate ways again. [sniffle]
648. [stern] You're the packaging engineer who signed off on, [pause], the last twelve shipments to the conflict zone, correct? [clearing throat]
649. [curious] Whatever you found must be significant if you're, [speeding up], coming directly to me instead of your supervisors first. [sigh]
650. [shocked] Um, are you saying that, [angry], someone in your company has been, well, [furious], deliberately compromising our peace mission?
651. Hmm, you're telling me that, [frustrated], while we've been negotiating ceasefires, um, someone has been, [very loudly], smuggling contraband through our own humanitarian channels?
652. [empathetically] This must be devastating for you to discover that your work, [long pause], has been corrupted like this. [groan]
653. [confidently] Well, um, listen, the fact that you're, [warm], coming forward now shows tremendous courage, I mean, this could save countless lives.
654. [relieved] We still have time to intercept it and, [formal], coordinate with local authorities to expose this entire operation.
655. [deep pitch] Well, um, I know.
656. You know, what matters now is that, [genuinely], you're doing the right thing when it counts most, um, even though it's costing you everything. [chuckle darkly]
657. [friendly] Your integrity in this moment might just, [hopeful], save the peace process we've been building, and honestly, [enunciating every word], that makes you more valuable than you know.
658. Your Excellency, I, um, understand your concern but, [anxious], falsifying medical data would violate every oath I've taken and, well, [trembling], the inspectors have their own testing equipment that will, [very quietly], reveal the truth regardless of what papers we show them.
659. [empathetically] The plague has already killed three thousand citizens and, [shaky voice], without proper containment protocols we're looking at exponential spread. [sigh]
660. [warm] Your Excellency, um, the best way to maintain credibility is, well, [sincerely], transparency because the international community will respect honest leadership during, er, [passionately], a health crisis more than they'll forgive an attempted cover-up. [cough]
661. [confidently] Acknowledging a health crisis isn't weakness—it's, [relieved], responsible governance that protects your people and, [clearing throat], demonstrates you value their lives over political optics.
662. [formal] The economy is already suffering because, [sadly], dead workers can't produce goods or services.
663. [gently] There's still time to implement quarantine zones, [hopefully], distribute medical supplies, and, [quickly], save thousands of lives if we act immediately.
664. [reassuring] History remembers leaders who faced crises with, [bravely], courage and honesty far better than those who let pride destroy their nations.
665. Those deaths weigh on me too, um, which is why, [determined], I'm begging you to let me do my job and, well, [crying while speaking], save whoever we still can.
666. [excited] We can frame this as, um, a leader choosing transparency and, well, [animated], international cooperation over isolation, which, er, [optimistic], actually strengthens your position globally.
667. Your grandfather didn't face airborne pathogens that could, [urgently], cross continents in hours, and his methods would only, [firmly], guarantee your kingdom's complete isolation and, [very slowly], eventual collapse.
668. [defensive] Well, uh, I wasn't exactly bothering anyone down here in the, [whispering], dark where nobody ever comes anyway. [pause]
669. [bitter] Yeah well, um, toxic gases aren't the worst thing I've, [shaky voice], had to survive this year. [laugh]
670. [anxious] Three months of hiding beats three years of being someone's, [very quietly], property, and these tunnels became my, [trailing off], sanctuary when I had nowhere else.
671. [suspicious] Shelters keep records, umm, ask questions, require identification that I, [nervous], don't have anymore because they took everything, [angry], including my name and my right to exist as a person.
672. [desperate] Please, I've learned which tunnels flood during storms, where the, [quickly], air flows cleanest, how to avoid the maintenance schedules you guys run every, [pleading], Tuesday and Thursday morning like clockwork.
673. [proudly] Well, um, survival requires observation, and I've gotten pretty good at, [confidently], being invisible when my life depends on it, you know?
674. [sad] I mean, they called me lots of things but, um, none of them were my real name which I'm still, [regretful], trying to remember how to be. [sniffle]
675. [grateful] You're not going to report me even though, uh, you could lose your job for, [trembling], falsifying safety records, and I mean, [overwhelmed], nobody's shown me that kind of kindness in so long.
676. Well, um, if you ever need someone who knows these tunnels better than, [chuckling], your own maintenance maps, I'll be around.
677. [tearful] Are you really offering me a job, I mean, a real job where I could, um, earn my way back to being, [shaky voice], a person again instead of just a ghost in your tunnels?
678. [defensive] Look, um, I didn't call to reconnect or anything, I just, well, figured you'd want to know about your, [bitter], precious animal before it dies up here in the cold, you know.
679. [quietly] She's behind the maintenance shed near lift seven, um, barely breathing and there's, [worried], blood on the snow, I mean, a lot of it.
680. Her eyes track movement but she can't, [exhausted], lift her head and she made this sound when I got close, [whispering], like a broken purr.
681. [reluctantly] I, um, wrapped her in emergency blankets from the ski patrol station and, well, tried to stop the bleeding with, [improvising], gauze from the first aid kit but I don't, er, know if I'm making things worse. [sigh]
682. [surprised] Wait, you're actually, um, complimenting me on something, I mean, that's a first since, well, [sarcastically], dad's funeral where you called me irresponsible.
683. [softly] She reminds me of that stuffed snow leopard you had, [nostalgic], in your room when we were kids, the one you said would protect us from nightmares.
684. [honest] I remember everything, um, including how you always dreamed of, [melancholic], working with big cats and, well, how proud I was when you got the zoo job even though I never, er, [trailing off], told you...
685. [nervous] Yeah, I suppose running into each other over a dying snow leopard is, [wry], probably the universe telling us something.
686. I've been telling her about the view from up here, how the, [peaceful], morning light hits the peaks and makes everything look like her natural habitat, [thoughtful], like home.
687. Maybe we're not as different as we, um, pretended to be all these years, [hopeful], huh? [laugh softly]
688. [bitter] You know, um, I survived Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, [angry], built a business from nothing after the war, and now at ninety-six I'm, [trembling], sitting here because the woman I trusted to help me, [shaky voice], stole everything, er, while I was too proud to admit I needed help.
689. [frustrated] My wife always handled the finances before she, [very quietly], passed two years ago, and I thought hiring Maria would, [pause], help me stay independent in my own home.
690. Well, I started noticing, um, when my checking account wouldn't cover the, [confused], grocery bill last week, you know.
691. [regretful] She helped me sign some papers when my, [slowly], arthritis was bad, but I never gave her permission to, [upset], take anything beyond her weekly pay.
692. [exhausted] You know, er, I just want enough money back to, [sad], stay in my house and not be a burden to my children who, um, [trailing off], live across the country. [sigh]
693. [curious] How long will this, [hesitantly], legal process take?
694. [defeated] Um, I don't know if I have months - at my age, every day is, [whispering], borrowed time, and I'm tired of fighting battles, but I suppose, [resolute], one more won't kill me, [bitter laugh], especially if it means other folks won't suffer like this, you know.
695. The hardest part is admitting I can't, [vulnerable], do everything alone anymore, that maybe it's time to, [accepting], let people help me. [long pause]
696. [determined] Well, um, then let's get started - I didn't survive this long to, [fierce], let some thief destroy what my Mary and I built over, er, [proud], sixty-three years of marriage.
697. [grateful] Thank you, young lady - you know, um, you remind me of my Mary with that, [nostalgic], fire in your eyes when something's not right, and I mean, [tearful], she would have liked you very much, [hopeful], fighting for people who can't fight for themselves anymore.
698. I've fitted prosthetics for soldiers and accident victims, but never for someone who, [gently], lost their arm saving thirty people from a collapsing bridge.
699. This new design has neural interface capabilities that could, [excited], restore about seventy percent of your original dexterity and, [hopeful], even enhance your grip strength beyond what you had before.
700. [warm] You know, the most, [empathetically], heroic person I ever met was a teacher who saved kids from a fire, lost her leg, and then, [passionate], went back to teaching with a prosthetic, showing those same kids that heroes, [slowly], adapt and continue.
701. [confidently] Well, I mean, this carbon fiber design is, [enthusiastic], lighter than your original arm, um, with sensors that can detect, [quickly], temperature changes and pressure variations, so you know, you might actually perform better than before.
702. [reassuring] Um, the neural mapping process will, well, [carefully], take about six months of training, but I mean, [determined], once your brain adapts to the interface, you'll be able to, [animated], control it with just thought impulses.
703. I mean, that's exactly what prosthetics are about, um, [comprehending], not replacing what was lost but creating something new entirely, you know?
704. [sincerely] The technology in this prosthetic could allow you to, [encouraging], lift twice your body weight and interface directly with, [proudly], digital systems that normal humans can't even access.
705. [cheerful] Every hero I've worked with has discovered that their prosthetic became, [inspired], not a limitation but a unique advantage that, [triumphant], defined their new identity. [laugh]
706. [gentle] Well, um, based on your muscle memory patterns and, [optimistic], neural responsiveness, I mean, I'd say you'll be back in action, [certain], stronger than ever within the year. [long pause]
707. [supportive] Your story isn't ending or even, [wise], pausing really, it's just, [knowing], transforming into something that nobody, [softly], including you, has imagined yet. [deep breath]
708. [excited] I passed! I actually—I passed the broker exam! All those months of studying with Richard, all those late nights he spent coaching me and... [pause] wait, what? [confused] That can't be right. I'm literally looking at the news on my phone while holding my passing certificate and—[stuttering] R-Richard's firm? Under investigation? [very quietly] For fraud?

This is, um, this has to be some kind of mistake. [anxious] He taught me everything. Every single principle about integrity in this business, about how trust is everything, how you never, ever compromise your ethics for a deal. [bitter] God, was that all just... what, performance? 

[angry] Three years! Three years I've been his shadow, learning from him, defending him when people said he was too aggressive with investments. I mean, I thought aggressive meant ambitious, not—[trailing off] not criminal.

[exhausted] So what does this mean for me now? Like, I just got licensed through someone who might be going to prison? [sarcastic] Great recommendation letter that'll be. "She was mentored by a fraudster but hey, she passed the test!" 

[long pause]

[very sad] I don't even know if I want this anymore. Everything I learned, was it even real? Or was I just... being trained to be the next generation of—[cry] I can't even say it.
709. They approved it. They actually—I can't believe they approved it. [gasp softly] Two hundred people, um, that's two hundred families who don't have to... God, I keep thinking about what almost happened. [relieved] You know, when I first pitched this restructuring plan, honestly, the board looked at me like I was, I mean, completely insane. But the numbers, they—the numbers worked. [excited] I knew they would work! It's just, er, nobody wanted to listen at first because it wasn't the traditional approach, right? 

[anxious] For three weeks I basically lived in that conference room, and like, every night I'd go home thinking, what if I'm wrong? What if I'm the reason these people—[pause] but no, no, we did it. [laugh] We actually pulled it off! The creditors agreed to the payment schedule, and um, the equity swap, it all just... clicked. 

[exhausted] I haven't slept properly in, hmm, I don't even know how long. But seeing their faces when we announced it today? [warm] The woman from accounting, she just started crying, and then, well, I started crying too. [chuckle] Two hundred jobs. That's not just numbers on a spreadsheet anymore, you know? That's—that's real people who get to keep their lives intact.
710. [very meekly] You know what's funny? My whole life, I've been the one nobody, um, nobody really noticed. [bitter] Always picked last for teams, always the backup plan, the spare tire. [sigh] My brothers got the height, the muscles, the— [trailing off] ...everything that mattered. [very quietly] And me? I got good at puzzles. [laugh] Great skillset, right? 

[pause]

But then yesterday, [speeding up] when the entire system crashed and everyone was panicking because we'd lose millions if we couldn't decrypt those files— [gasp softly] suddenly everyone's looking at me. [confused] Me! The IT guy who eats lunch alone. [anxious] They're all standing behind my chair, watching, waiting, and I'm thinking, like, this is it. [confidently] But my hands just... knew what to do. [excited] Every pattern, every algorithm I'd practiced alone in my room for years just clicked into place, and— [extremely happy] I cracked it! [laugh loudly] Three minutes, forty-seven seconds! 

[warm] The CEO actually shook my hand. [very sincerely] Said I saved the company. [shaky voice] Twenty-eight years of being invisible and finally, I mean finally, [passionately] being exactly who I am was exactly what they needed.
711. [gasp softly] I got it. I actually—they chose me. [very quietly] The email came through like twenty minutes ago and I'm still, you know, just sitting here staring at it. [excited] MIT's diversity fellowship, I mean that's—god, that's literally everything I've been working toward. [short pause] And honestly, er, part of me is like... [hesitantly] should I feel weird that it's specifically the diversity fellowship? Like, I know I'm qualified, [confidently] my research on quantum computing algorithms is solid, my advisor basically said so, but there's this little voice that's, hmm, wondering if people will think... [trailing off] [sigh] No, you know what? Actually, fuck that. [passionately] I earned this. Every late night in the lab, every, uh, every rejection letter before this—and believe me there were so many—[laugh] all of it led here. [warm] My mom's going to absolutely lose it when I tell her. [very excited] She always said, "mija, you're going to change things," and I guess, well, maybe she was right? [shaky voice] I just—I can't believe I get to work with Dr. Chen. [extremely happy] This is really happening. I'm really doing this.
712. [happy] Look at him up there, I mean—God, he's actually doing it. [shaky voice] Eight years ago, he was just this kid sitting at my kitchen table, you know, crying because he thought he'd never, [pause] never be able to afford it. And I remember, um, pulling out my savings account statement and just—[chuckle] the look on his face when I said we were gonna make this work. [crying while speaking] All those double shifts I picked up, and honestly, the ramen dinners, the, uh, the second job at the warehouse—[sniffle] it was all worth it for this exact moment. Like, [warm] watching him walk across that stage in his cap and gown, knowing he's Doctor Martinez now, not just my little brother who used to, er, steal my Halloween candy. [gasp softly] Mom would've been so—[shaky voice] she would've been so proud. I mean, [very sincerely] I basically raised him after she died, right? So this is kind of—it's just that—[pause] [relieved] we actually did it. We really, actually did it. [smiling speaking] And next month he starts his residency at Johns Hopkins, which is, hmm, absolutely insane. [very quietly] Sometimes I wonder what I could've done if I'd had someone to help me like that, but—[happy] no, this is his moment. [exhausted] God, I'm so tired but so, so happy.
713. [very quietly] Six months. Um, six months of my life just... gone. I mean, they called me yesterday and basically said—[bitter] "Hey, remember those thirty-seven matte paintings you did? Yeah, well, they're cutting that entire sequence." Just like that. 

[pause] 

And honestly, the thing is—I turned down two other projects for this. You know? Because this was supposed to be it. [frustrated] This was the one that would get my name out there, like, finally. My parents keep asking, "So when can we see your movie?" and I'm just—[laugh] what do I even tell them? 

I keep thinking maybe if I'd done something different with the color palette, or, I don't know, worked faster on the revisions—[trailing off] but that's stupid. The director loved them. Er, he literally said they were "breathtaking." [sarcastic] Breathtaking enough to delete, apparently.

[sigh]

And here's the thing—I still have to pay rent next month. So, um, I guess I'll just... start over? Send my portfolio around again like I'm fresh out of school? [very melancholic] God, I really thought this was it. I mean, everyone said the film was going to be huge. [whispering] I already updated my LinkedIn.
714. [shocked] They just—they just told me. Twenty minutes ago. Um, my position is being... "sunset" is what they called it. [bitter] Sunset. Like, that's supposed to make it sound prettier or something? I mean, basically they're replacing me with, uh, with software. AI software. [pause] 

Fifteen years. That's—I've been here fifteen goddamn years, you know? And they're just... [shaky voice] sorry, I'm trying not to—anyway, they said the AI can schedule meetings and, like, manage calendars and draft emails twenty-four seven. No sick days. No, er, no salary. [sarcastic] Perfect employee, right?

The thing is, I actually—[laughing] this is so stupid—I actually helped them pick the software. HR asked me to, hmm, to evaluate different options last month. [very quietly] I basically hired my own replacement. How's that for irony?

[angry] And they gave me two weeks. Two weeks to, what, train a computer program? To hand over all my—[trailing off] 

I don't even know what I'm gonna tell my kids. Mommy got replaced by a chatbot? [sniffle] God, I'm forty-three years old and I have to start over because some algorithm can... [long pause]

[exhausted] Whatever. Maybe I'll, um, maybe I'll go back to school or something. Learn to code. [dry laugh] If you can't beat them, right?
715. [shaky voice] I just—I mean, I wrote what I saw, you know? The piece was honest, it was, um, exactly what I felt standing in front of those paintings. [pause] And now Marina's phone won't stop ringing, galleries from, like, three different cities want her work, and that's—[excited] God, that's incredible, right? She deserves every bit of it. [trailing off] But Gerald... 

[sigh] Twenty years he's been showing artists, and I—well, I basically called his curatorial vision "myopic and dated." [regretful] Those were my exact words. Hmm, I keep seeing his face when he read it. [very quietly] He taught me everything about this business.

[frustrated] The thing is, though, he should've seen Marina's talent! I mean, he rejected her twice—twice!—and for what? Because she didn't fit his, er, precious aesthetic? [bitter] "Too raw," he said. [pause] 

[sad] But still, I didn't—okay, honestly, I didn't think the review would, you know, actually close his gallery. [anxious] Three artists pulled out yesterday. His biggest collector just, um, canceled everything. [long pause] 

[very meekly] What kind of person destroys their mentor to make a point? [hesitantly] Even if the point needed making?
716. [frustrated] Two years. I mean, honestly, two fucking years of my life and they just—[pause] they send an email? [bitter] "Due to unforeseen budget constraints, the funeral director training program will be discontinued effective immediately." [sarcastic] Oh, that's really professional, thanks so much. [angry] Like, you know what? I turned down other programs for this. I literally moved here, [shaky voice] I got that stupid apartment near the mortuary science building, and for what? [very sad] My mom was so proud when I told her I finally found my thing, you know? She kept telling everyone her kid was gonna be—[cry] God, this is so embarrassing. [sniffle] The thing is, um, I actually loved it. Like, I know people think it's weird but I was really good at, er, helping families through their worst days. [laugh] And now what? [confused] I'm supposed to just, what, start over? Find something else? [exhausted] I can't even get my tuition back because technically the semester already started. [very quietly] Maybe I should've seen this coming. I mean, who needs funeral directors anyway, right? [trailing off] Everyone's just dying to get into other careers... [bitter] That's a joke. Sort of. I don't know anymore.
717. [exhausted] Eight hours today, pushing carts in the parking lot while these people just... walk right through me. [bitter] Like I'm not even there, you know? This woman today, [mocking] designer everything, literally dropped her receipt right in front of me and just—waited. [pause] Waited for me to pick it up like I'm some kind of... [frustrated] I don't know, automated service? [sigh] And the thing is, um, I need this job. [quietly] Desperately need it. Tuition's due next month and I'm still, [anxious] God, I'm still three hundred short. [laugh] Sometimes I wonder what they'd think if they knew their cart guy is pre-med. [sarcastic] Probably assume I'm lying, right? Because people like me don't— [trailing off] whatever. [sad] My mom keeps asking how school's going and I tell her it's fine, everything's fine, but honestly... [shaky voice] I had to skip lunch again today to save the seven dollars. [angry] Seven dollars! That's nothing to them! This guy tipped the valet twenty just for pulling his car around, but when I loaded his entire— [very loudly] his entire grocery haul into his Range Rover? [whispering] "Thanks." That's it. [deep pitch] Just "thanks." [very melancholic] Sometimes I feel like I'm disappearing, like, becoming actually invisible. [crying while speaking] And the worst part is I smile anyway because I can't afford not to.
718. [hesitantly] Okay, um, here goes nothing with this thing again. I mean, honestly, I've been avoiding this bindery machine for like—what, three months now? [nervous laugh] Every time someone asked me to bind something I'd just, you know, make up some excuse about the copier needing me or whatever. [pause] But today I actually—wait, is that click supposed to happen? [confused] Oh. Oh my God, that's... that's actually right. [excited] The alignment guide just, er, clicked into place exactly like Sarah showed me! 

[speeding up] Okay okay okay, so now I feed the papers through and—holy shit, it's working! [laugh] I mean, look at that, the spine is actually forming properly! Not like last time when I basically created this, uhh, twisted disaster that looked like modern art or something. [cheerful] You know what? I think I've actually got this! 

[very excited] The punch went through clean, the coil is threading perfectly—I'm literally doing this! [laugh loudly] Three months of being terrified of this stupid machine and now I'm just—[triumphant] boom, done! [relieved] God, I feel so ridiculous for putting this off for so long. But hey, at least now I can actually, you know, stop hiding in the supply closet whenever someone needs binding done. [chuckle]
719. [relieved] The judge ruled in my favor. Full custody. I should be—I mean, I am happy, I fought so hard for this. [pause] But when I picked them up yesterday, the way Emma looked at me... [regretful] like I was the villain in her story. [sigh] Jake won't even speak to me, just these one-word answers. "Fine." "Whatever." "Sure." [bitter] They think I destroyed our family, that I'm the one who—[voice breaking] but they don't understand what was happening behind closed doors, you know? [defensive] I had to protect them. I had to. Even if it meant becoming the bad guy in their eyes. [crying while speaking] Emma said she hates me for making Dad look bad in court. She's twelve—she doesn't know about the drinking, the... [trailing off] [long pause] Maybe I should've handled it differently? But how? [frustrated] How do you explain to your kids that sometimes love isn't enough, that sometimes protecting them means they'll hate you for it? [very quietly] Jake used to run to me when he got home from school. Now he goes straight to his room. [sniffle] I won. [bitter laugh] I won everything and lost them anyway. [whispering] What kind of victory is that?
