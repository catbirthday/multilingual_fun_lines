Scenario: A choreographer discovers their new tango student is unknowingly the current partner of the choreographer's ex, seeking lessons to impress him with the same dance they once shared.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So you're here to learn the tango for someone special, your intake form says. [pause] That's quite a romantic gesture, not many people commit to learning something this complex just to impress a partner.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Yes, it's for my boyfriend Marcus! [cheerfully] He mentioned once that his ex was this incredible dancer and they used to tango together all the time, so I thought maybe if I learned, we could share that too.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Marcus Chen? [clearing throat] I mean, that's a lovely thought, really sweet of you to want to connect with him through dance, though tango is particularly intimate, requires a lot of trust between partners.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] You know him? [surprised] Wait, of course you probably do, this is the only serious dance studio in the neighborhood and he said his ex taught here or something like that.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Right, his ex taught here. [slowly] Actually still teaches here every Tuesday and Thursday, which I'm guessing is why you booked Monday lessons, though you probably didn't know that when you signed up.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] How would you know when his ex teaches? [hesitantly] Marcus just said to avoid those days because it might be awkward, but he didn't give me specifics about who or why exactly.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastically] Because I make the teaching schedule. [sighs] Look, let's just focus on the basics today, starting with your posture and frame, since tango requires a very specific kind of connection between partners.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Oh god, you're friends with them, aren't you? [quickly] I'm sorry if this is weird, I had no idea, Marcus just said this was the best studio and I really want to surprise him.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] The Argentine tango isn't just about the steps, it's about understanding your partner's breath, their weight shifts, the unspoken conversation happening between your bodies. [pause] Marcus used to say it was like having a three-minute love affair.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] That's exactly how he described it to me! [warmly] He gets this look in his eyes when he talks about dancing, like he's remembering something beautiful but painful at the same time, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] Yeah, I know that look. [quietly] He used to get it when we'd practice our routine for competitions, right before we'd step onto the floor, like he was already mourning the moment ending.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, we? [stuttering] You're, oh my god, you're Alex? The Alex who choreographed that piece he has framed in his apartment, the one from the nationals?

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] I'm your instructor, that's all that matters right now. [clearing throat] If you want to learn tango, I'll teach you tango, but we should probably establish some professional boundaries going forward.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I had no idea, I swear, the booking system just showed 'A. Rivera' and I never put it together. [shaky voice] God, this must be so awful for you, teaching me to dance for him.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] It's actually not awful, it's just strange. [sighs] Seeing someone else want to learn his language, trying to speak to him in the way we used to communicate without words.

Character 2 [en]: [very meekly] Should I leave? [hesitantly] Find another studio? I don't want to make this harder for you than it already is, and Marcus doesn't even know I'm doing this yet.

Character 1 [en]: [confident] No, stay.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] How can you be so calm about this? [loudly] I'm literally here learning your dance, your connection with him, trying to recreate something you two had together!

Character 1 [en]: Because dance isn't something you can steal or recreate, it's born from the specific chemistry between two people. [very sincerely] What you'll create with him will be entirely yours, even if you're dancing the same steps we once did.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Thank you for saying that. [slowly] I guess I should tell him I'm taking lessons here, shouldn't I? He'll find out eventually, and it's better if it comes from me.
