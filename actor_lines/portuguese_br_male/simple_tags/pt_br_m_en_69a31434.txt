=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Um, you're here about Shadow, well, the black cat from, [pause], Eleanor Blackwood's estate, and uh, I should mention she, [warm], talked about you quite a lot actually.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Wait, you knew my grandmother—she never, [hesitantly], mentioned coming here or having any, [shaky voice], connection to an animal shelter at all. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] She volunteered here every Thursday for, [slowly], the past six years, always wearing these beautiful vintage gloves and, [trailing off], bringing homemade treats for the staff...

Character 2 [en]: Um, I don't, well, understand.

Character 1 [en]: Your grandmother specifically requested that Shadow come here if, [very quietly], anything happened to her—she trusted us completely.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] She told everyone else I was too irresponsible, [frustrated], too dark and morbid to care for anything properly, but apparently, [speeding up], she told strangers at a shelter about me.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Actually, she said you were the only one who'd, [clearing throat], understand Shadow's peculiar needs—how he only sleeps on velvet and, [smiling speaking], refuses to eat unless Bauhaus is playing.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Um, she actually told you about, well, the Bauhaus thing, because I mean, [laugh], I taught him that when I was fifteen and, uh, going through my first goth phase.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] Well, um, she kept a photo of you two in her volunteer locker, you know, [tenderly], the one where you're both wearing matching black lace collars, and, [chuckle], she'd show it to every new volunteer who started here.

Character 2 [en]: That photo was from my eighteenth birthday when everyone else thought I was, [upset], being ridiculous and dramatic.

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] Um, Eleanor never thought that—she'd sit here after her shift, well, [thoughtful], telling me how you were the only family member who truly saw her, not just, [long pause], the proper lady everyone expected her to be.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] Well, I mean, she was the only one who never asked me to, um, tone it down or dress normal for family events, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] She left specific instructions that Shadow should only go to you, [relieved], along with this envelope she asked me to give you when, [whispering], you finally came for him. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Um, I thought she'd forgotten about me these last few years, I mean, [regretful], we hadn't talked much after I moved away for, well, [anxious], art school and everything.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Um, she talked about your paintings constantly, er, especially the dark landscapes you posted online, and, well, [proud], she even bought three of them anonymously through your website.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Those anonymous purchases with the poetry quotes were from her—I always wondered who, [emotional], understood my work that deeply.

Character 1 [en]: [kindly] Shadow's been waiting in our special quiet room, refusing to interact with anyone, [knowing], almost like he's been holding out specifically for you, and, [animatedly], he perked up the moment you walked through our front door.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] Can I see him now, please, because I, [desperately], really need to hold something that still smells like her house, like, [sniffling], her lavender and sage incense.

Character 1 [en]: Of course, and there's something else—she sponsored a gothic pet photography program here, [proudly], specifically requesting that we help other alternative kids connect with rescue animals.

Character 2 [en]: [touched] That sounds exactly like something she'd do quietly without telling anyone, [peaceful], making sure other misunderstood kids had somewhere to belong, [very melancholic], just like she did for me. [deep breath]
