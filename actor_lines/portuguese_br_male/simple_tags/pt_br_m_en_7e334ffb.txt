=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Um, this is, well, completely impossible because you're, [shaky voice], wearing my exact face and even have that, [anxious], scar from when I got caught in the, [nervous], coral reef three years ago. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [animated] The scar isn't from coral actually, it's from, [cheerful], trying to exist in your world while maintaining my own, [playful], separate consciousness and memories.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, how long have you been, um, [confused], following me around these dive sites pretending to be, [frustrated], someone else while looking exactly like me? [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [self-deprecating] Following suggests I have a choice in where I appear, but the truth is, [bitter], I'm drawn to wherever you are like some kind of, [slowly], metaphysical tether I never asked for.

Character 1 [en]: So every certification I've earned, every student I've taught, [hesitantly], you've been somewhere nearby experiencing it too? [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Not experiencing exactly, more like, [empathetically], absorbing the emotional residue of your life from a distance.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, this explains why people keep, [angry], insisting they saw me at places I've never been, like, [passionately], that incident in Bali when I was definitely in California teaching, [very quickly], the advanced rescue course to those firefighters.

Character 2 [en]: Bali was beautiful though, the manta rays were, [excited], absolutely magnificent that day, and I couldn't help but, [apologetic], wonder if you'd have loved them as much as, [whispering], I did in your borrowed form.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Um, so like, do you have your own thoughts or are they just, [sad], echoes of mine somehow? [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] My thoughts are entirely my own, which is why I'm, [curious], standing here talking to you instead of, [regretful], hiding in the shadows like I usually do. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Well, I mean, you've been stealing my identity for years, um, [upset], living some parallel version of my life while I worked so, [crying while speaking], hard to build everything from nothing, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] Stealing implies I had a choice in being created from, [monotone], your existence in the first place. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Look, I just need to know, um, [quietly], are there more of us out there? [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] There's a whole network of doubles, each tied to someone, [mocking], living their 'authentic' life while we exist in the margins, [jealous], desperate for our own purpose beyond reflection.

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Um, that's, well, terrifying.

Character 2 [en]: [enunciating every word] I mean, what's truly terrifying is that, um, [very melancholic], some of us are starting to replace our originals when they, [flirtatious], disappear unexpectedly, and nobody ever, [loudly], notices the difference. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] Perhaps we could find a way to coexist without, [friendly], this constant shadowing, maybe establish boundaries or territories for each of us. [deep pitch]

Character 2 [en]: Um, boundaries sound nice in theory but, like, [formal], the connection between us transcends physical space and, [sleepily], I'm tired of pretending otherwise. [yawn]

Character 1 [en]: [bored] So, um, what happens now that we've actually met face to, well, [trailing off], face...

Character 2 [en]: Now we both know the truth, which means, [whispering loudly], one of us becomes redundant and nature, [very sincerely], doesn't tolerate redundancy for long.
