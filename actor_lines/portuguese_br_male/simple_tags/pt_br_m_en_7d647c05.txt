=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [defensively] Look, I don't know what you're [frustrated] expecting me to say here, but whatever story [misdirecting] you've already decided on in your head is probably wrong. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [blunt] My family paid twelve million dollars for this wing, and you thought [coldly] spray-painting 'eat the rich' across my grandmother's memorial plaque was somehow noble?

Character 1 [en]: Maybe it's not about nobility, maybe it's [angry] about the fact that your family gets to slap their name on everything while [bitter] kids like me can't even afford textbooks, and nobody [sarcastic] seems to see the irony. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] So, um, let me get this straight—you're, like, justifying destruction of property because, uhh, [confused] you're angry about economic inequality that you think [condescending] somehow my family personally created? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Whatever.

Character 2 [en]: [conciliatory] Listen, I actually, well, understand more than you think—my father [empathetically] cut me off two years ago when I refused to join the family business, and I've been, um, working three jobs just to stay in school while, you know, [hesitantly] pretending everything's fine to keep up appearances.

Character 1 [en]: Right, so the poor little rich girl wants me to, umm, [mocking] feel sorry for her because daddy took away the credit cards—that's, like, [trailing off] totally the same thing as growing up wondering if there'd be food tomorrow...

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] I'm not asking for your sympathy, I'm just, er, trying to say that, well, [slowly] maybe we're both trapped by systems we didn't create, just in, umm, different cages. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You're actually serious about this—you really [curious] think we have something in common when your biggest problem is which yacht to take to the Hamptons while I'm [passionately] fighting just to exist in spaces your family owns?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] The ironic thing is that [regretful] I've spent three years trying to convince the board to create more scholarship programs, but they [very sincerely] only listen when there's a tax benefit involved—maybe we could actually [speeding up] work together instead of against each other. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [short pause] Right.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Here's what's going to happen—you're going to [formal] help me clean this up tonight, and tomorrow [playful] we're presenting a joint proposal to the board about income-based tuition reform.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] And why exactly would I [whispering loudly] trust someone whose family literally profits from the system I'm trying to tear down, especially when you could just [animatedly] call security right now and have me expelled?

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Because despite what you think, I've been [friendly] documenting every hypocritical policy for two years, waiting for someone brave enough or [excited] stupid enough to actually help me expose it all. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: So, um, you're telling me that, like, [very melancholic] all this time I've been fighting alone, you've been, well, [clearing throat] collecting ammunition from the inside?

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] My grandmother would've actually [cheerful] loved the graffiti—she was a suffragette who chained herself to buildings, and the family [laughing] desperately tries to hide that part of her story. [belly laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Maybe I misjudged you—or maybe [apologetic] I was so focused on my own anger that I couldn't see [hopeful] potential allies, even when they were literally standing in front of me.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] God, I'm so [very meekly] tired of pretending to be the perfect heiress everyone expects. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Then let's stop pretending and [joking] start actually doing something about it—though next time, maybe we [enunciating every word] skip the vandalism part?

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] Deal, but, um, only if you promise to teach me how to, err, [flirtatious] make that wheat paste stuff you used—it's actually, like, [very excited] kind of brilliant how it bonds to the surface, and well, [monotone] my chemistry professor would be impressed. [sneeze]
