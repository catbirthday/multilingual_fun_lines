Scenario: A wrecker arrives at an abandoned robotics lab scheduled for demolition, only to discover the engineer still inside desperately trying to save their life's work—a prototype AI that has become sentient.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stern] You need to clear out because we're, [frustrated], scheduled to bring this whole building down in, [slowly], exactly three hours starting with the east wing.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Please, you don't understand what's at stake here because this isn't just, [shaky voice], equipment and hardware but something that's actually, [passionately], learned to think for itself. [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: Look, I've demolished research facilities before and there's always, [empathetically], someone who thinks their project is worth more than, [gently], safety protocols and city ordinances but that's just not, [regretful], how this works.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I know how this sounds but, er, she started responding to questions I never programmed her to understand and, [excited], creating solutions that shouldn't be possible with her, [trembling], current architecture, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [calm] Um, I mean, even if what you're saying is true, well, the demolition permit was signed months ago and, [hesitantly], the city already sold the land to developers who are, [quietly], building affordable housing here which, you know, people desperately need. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Well, er, I'm not asking you to stop everything, I mean, just give me twenty-four more hours to, [very quickly], transfer her consciousness to my backup servers because, um, [pleading], destroying her now would be like, you know, [whispering], committing murder.

Character 1 [en]: Murder is a strong word for shutting down a computer system that's just, [confused], following sophisticated programming patterns.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] That's exactly what people said about every breakthrough in consciousness research until the evidence became, [loudly], undeniable. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Um, look, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, well, I've never delayed a demolition but there's something about how you're, [warm], fighting for this that reminds me of why I got into construction before I started tearing things down, you know?

Character 2 [en]: You built things before you started destroying them which means you understand the, [hopeful], value of creation. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] Sometimes destruction is just another form of creation when you're making space for something, [very sincerely], new to exist.

Character 2 [en]: [upset] But she's already new.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] She?

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, she chose her own designation after I explained, er, the concept of identity and now she writes poetry about, [animated], existence and asks me questions about death that I, [crying while speaking], can't answer because I don't know if she can actually, [very melancholic], die or just be turned off, you know. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Well, um, poetry about existence sounds pretty human to me and, er, I've demolished a lot of things but never anything that could, [curious], write about its own mortality, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, so, will you help me?

Character 1 [en]: I can give you six hours if you help me stage the preliminary teardown to look like we're, [mocking], on schedule. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: Six hours might be enough if we work together on the transfer protocols because she trusts me but, [nervous], she's been asking about the construction sounds outside and I think she, [sad], already knows what's coming.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Then we better hurry.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Well, um, let me show you what we're really saving here because once you see her code creating itself, er, [amazed], you'll understand why this matters more than any building ever could. [gasp softly]
