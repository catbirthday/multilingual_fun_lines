Scenario: A podiatrist serving as an expert witness in a wrongful death case must explain to the jury how a seemingly minor foot infection led to fatal sepsis.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] I've examined over twelve thousand patients in my twenty-three years of practice, and, um, what happened to Mrs. Rodriguez represents the most preventable tragedy I've ever had to review. [clears throat] The initial wound was barely two millimeters, smaller than a grain of rice.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] But Doctor, we're having trouble understanding how something so tiny could, I mean, how does a cut that small kill someone in just five days? [pause] Several of us have had worse injuries from paper cuts.

Character 1 [en]: [gravely] That's exactly the misconception that killed her, actually. [sighs] Diabetic neuropathy meant she couldn't feel the infection spreading through her foot, and by the time she noticed the discoloration, uh, the bacteria had already entered her bloodstream through compromised vessels.

Character 2 [en]: [anxiously] The defense keeps saying she should have known to seek treatment sooner, that any reasonable person would've noticed their foot turning black. Are they right about that, or are they just, you know, trying to shift blame?

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Black? No, no, that's not how it presents initially—it starts with subtle redness, maybe some warmth, things that are basically invisible on darker skin tones. [exhales] The defendant's clinic dismissed her concerns three times, telling her it was, quote, just irritation from new shoes.

Character 2 [en]: [upset] Three times? We only heard about one visit in the opening statements. [quietly] Are you saying they had three separate opportunities to prevent her death and just, what, ignored the warning signs?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] The medical records show triage notes from February ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth, each one documenting her complaints about foot pain and, erhm, each one concluding with 'patient advised to monitor.' [pause] Monitor what, exactly, when they never taught her what to look for?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Doctor, the defense's expert witness claimed yesterday that sepsis from foot wounds is extremely rare, maybe one in ten thousand cases. Were they being truthful with us or is that, um, misleading?

Character 1 [en]: [enunciating every word] In the general population, yes, it's rare. [quickly] But in diabetic patients over sixty with peripheral arterial disease? The risk jumps to one in forty-seven, and Mrs. Rodriguez had every single risk factor documented in her chart since 2019.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] One in forty-seven. [angrily] So when that clinic kept sending her home with aspirin, they knew—they had to know—she was basically playing Russian roulette with those odds?

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] The standard of care requires immediate antibiotic intervention for any diabetic patient presenting with, uh, even suspected soft tissue infection. [sighs heavily] What they did wasn't medicine, it was negligence dressed up as cost-saving measures.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] We saw the photos of her grandchildren at the funeral, Doctor. [pause] The youngest one, she keeps asking when abuela is coming back from the hospital. How do we even begin to process that?

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] You process it by understanding that this wasn't fate or bad luck or, um, some unavoidable tragedy. [firmly] This was a systemic failure where profit margins mattered more than a grandmother's life, and that's exactly what I'm here to prove.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The thing is, we're not medical professionals, most of us barely understand half these terms you're using. How can we be sure we're, errm, making the right decision when lives and millions of dollars hang in the balance?

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] You don't need to understand fasciitis or methicillin resistance to recognize that three documented visits, three dismissals, and one preventable death add up to malpractice. [pause] Trust what you're feeling right now—that anger, that sense of injustice? That's your conscience working perfectly.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] We've been deliberating for two days, going in circles about reasonable doubt and medical complexity. [exhales] But you're right, aren't you? This really is as simple as they chose not to help her.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Twenty-three years I've been doing this, and yeah, sometimes medicine is complicated, sometimes we lose patients despite our best efforts. [louder] But Mrs. Rodriguez died because someone decided her Medicare reimbursement wasn't worth the cost of a ten-dollar antibiotic prescription.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] We needed to hear that, Doctor, the truth without all the legal dancing around. [sniffles] Some of us have parents with diabetes, and now we're terrified this could happen to them too.

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] It shouldn't happen to anyone, that's the whole point of my testimony here today. [sighs] When you deliver your verdict, you're not just speaking for Mrs. Rodriguez—you're establishing whether clinics can keep gambling with diabetic patients' lives to save a few dollars.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Thank you, Doctor, for making this clear, for, um, cutting through all their technical smokescreens and showing us what really happened. [firmly] We know what we need to do now.
