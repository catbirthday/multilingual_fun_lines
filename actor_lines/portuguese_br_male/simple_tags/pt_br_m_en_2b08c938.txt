=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, um, I didn't expect to see, [shocked], you here of all places, I mean, [retreating], after everything that happened between us, [trailing off], this is really awkward.

Character 2 [en]: The court sends me, [patient], all kinds of people for community service, but seeing your name on today's intake list, [warm], definitely caught me off guard after two years of, [pause], radio silence.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, I know I disappeared without explanation, [anxious], but I had my reasons and honestly, [bitter], I wasn't ready to face anyone from that part of my life, especially not you.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Everyone who walks through these doors has a story about not being ready, [empathetically], and that's exactly why this place exists.

Character 1 [en]: Um, so like, are you going to make this weird, or can we just, [nervous], pretend we don't know each other?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, that's not really how this works, you know—we're going to be, [honest], working together for the next sixty hours whether we acknowledge our history or not.

Character 1 [en]: The judge said community service would help with, [quietly], rehabilitation, but this feels more like punishment.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] Maybe it's neither—maybe it's just, [thoughtful], life putting us back in the same room because there's still something unfinished between us that needs, [slowly], proper closure or at least acknowledgment. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] After you helped me get sober the first time, I relapsed and, [ashamed], couldn't face the disappointment I knew I'd see in your eyes.

Character 2 [en]: Disappointment was never what I felt—it was, [sad], worry and concern, wondering if you were alive, [whispering], if you were safe somewhere out there.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] I've been working in post-production, creating perfect composite images while my actual life was, [frustrated], falling apart behind the scenes.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, the residents here, they'll appreciate having someone who understands what it's like to, [compassionate], maintain a facade while struggling underneath, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Um, I mean, I got another DUI last month, and like, sitting in that cell, [shaky voice], all I could think about was how you warned me this would happen if I didn't, [very quietly], stay connected to my support system.

Character 2 [en]: [reassuring] Well, er, you're here now, and um, that's what matters—not the path that brought you back, but, [hopeful], the fact that you're willing to try again.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] So, um, where do we even start, I mean, after all this time and, [confused], all the things left unsaid between us?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] We start exactly where we are—you'll help our residents with their job applications, [practical], teach them basic computer skills for video editing, and maybe in the process, [warm], we'll both find what we've been looking for. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: The irony isn't lost on me that I'm here to help people, [bitter], rebuild their lives when I can't even, [broken], keep my own together.

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes teaching others what we struggle with ourselves is, [wise], exactly how we learn to apply those lessons to our own lives—I've seen it happen, [sincerely], more times than I can count in these rooms, [soft], with people just like you.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe you're right, and this is exactly where I need to be, [accepting], even if it terrifies me.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Well, um, fear means you're facing something real, you know, and I mean, [encouraging], that's already more honest than where you were two years ago when you ran, [gently], so let's just take this one day at a time. [deep breath]
