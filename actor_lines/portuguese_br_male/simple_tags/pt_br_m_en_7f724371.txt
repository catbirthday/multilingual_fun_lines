=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Congratulations again.

Character 2 [en]: The paycheck felt, [confused], heavier than I expected, almost like it was, [guilty], accusing me of something I couldn't name.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Well, um, I've seen this reaction before, and er, it's more, [concerned], common than you might think when people finally get, [gently], stable after years on the streets.

Character 2 [en]: Every night in my apartment I hear, [anxious], phantom sounds of shopping carts and wonder if Marcus is still, [bitter], sleeping under the bridge where we used to camp together.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, survivor's guilt is, well, incredibly real and, [thoughtful], it can sabotage the very progress you've worked, [carefully], so hard to achieve these past months.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] I mean, um, how am I supposed to enjoy having walls and heat when, er, there are still, [frustrated], forty people I know personally who are, [shaky voice], freezing out there tonight?

Character 3 [en]: Well, um, the thing is, you staying housed and, [firmly], successful actually creates more opportunities for others, not, [passionate], fewer—every success story like yours helps secure more funding.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Your stability gives you power to advocate in ways you never could before.

Character 2 [en]: But their faces haunt me when I'm, [melancholic], grocery shopping with actual money instead of food stamps.

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] Listen, the system that kept you, [angry], homeless for three years is the same one that wants you to feel, [slowly], guilty about escaping it—don't give it that satisfaction.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Sometimes I walk past our old camp and feel like, [regretful], a traitor in my clean clothes.

Character 1 [en]: [wisely] The best revenge against a broken system is to, [confidently], thrive despite it and then reach back to pull others through.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, Marcus called me a sellout last week when, um, I offered to help him with, [hurt], his housing application, and that just, [trembling], broke something inside me. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Um, you know, er, people in crisis often, [understanding], lash out at those who remind them that, [patiently], change is possible—it's easier than facing their own fear. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: So, well, I'm supposed to just, um, forget where I came from and, [sarcastically], pretend everything's fine now that I have, [exhausted], an address and a job?

Character 1 [en]: [stern] No, I mean, you're supposed to remember exactly where you came from and, er, use that knowledge to, [determined], become the advocate those forty people desperately need, someone who, [animated], actually understands their reality.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, maybe you're right, but like, the guilt feels so, [heavily], heavy some days I can barely get out of my new bed, [whispered], wondering who's dying out there while I sleep warm.

Character 1 [en]: That guilt is actually, [seriously], proof of your humanity still being intact after everything.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I guess I never thought about it like that before. [deep breath]

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, your success isn't betrayal—it's actually, er, the most radical act of resistance you could, [proudly], possibly commit against a system designed to keep you down. [long pause]
