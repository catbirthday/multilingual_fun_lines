Scenario: A rubber plant operator discovers their new apprentice is actually their illegitimate child from a brief affair twenty years ago, who has tracked them down seeking answers about their identity.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So the HR department said you specifically, [confused], requested to apprentice under me even though there were, [slowly], twelve other operators with better shifts available.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] The shifts weren't the reason I chose you, there were, [trembling], other factors that made this placement, [quietly], necessary for me. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [suspicious] You've been watching me during breaks and asking the other workers, [anxious], personal questions about my past that have nothing to do with rubber processing.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Maybe I'm just trying to understand what kind of man, [coldly], abandons their responsibilities and never looks back. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] What did you say?

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Look, um, I know this is, like, [frustrated], awkward but I need to, well, [very quietly], tell you something about who I am and, umm, [trailing off], why I'm really here...

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] No. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Yes, and before you try to, [speeding up], deny it again I have the DNA test results and the, [monotone], birth certificate with your name listed under father even though you, [loud], never signed it.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Twenty years ago I was a different person who made, [embarrassed], choices that I thought would protect everyone including, [whispering loudly], your mother.

Character 2 [en]: She died last month which is, um, [crying while speaking], why I finally decided to, like, [determined], find you after all these years. [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: Oh God, I didn't know she was, um, [very sad], sick or I would have, well, [stammering], tried to help somehow even if she, like, never wanted to see me again. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: She never told me your name until the, [bored], very end when she finally admitted that you worked here and that you, [sarcastic], probably wouldn't even remember her after all this, [mocking], time. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Remember her? I think about that summer, umm, [melancholic], every single day when I walk past the, like, [warm], quality control station where she used to work before you were, well, [clearing throat], born. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: Then why did you leave us to, [furious], struggle alone while you kept your comfortable job and your, [condescending], respectable life intact? [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Your grandfather threatened to destroy my career and make sure I never worked, [desperate], anywhere in this industry again if I didn't disappear. [yawn]

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So you chose rubber manufacturing over being a father to your own, [disgusted], child? [sneeze]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] No, I chose to, like, [passionately], send money every month through an intermediary so you could, umm, [relieved], have food and education even if you never knew it was, well, [very slowly], from me. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] The monthly envelopes with no return address that kept us, [excited], afloat when things got really bad were from, [softly], you this whole, [cheerful], time? [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [proudly] Every single month for twenty years without fail even when I was, [happy], laid off twice and had to take, [confident], night jobs to keep them coming.

Character 2 [en]: I spent my whole life, um, [extremely happy], hating a ghost who was actually, like, [friendly], supporting us the only way he could while I, well, [playful], built this elaborate story of abandonment in my, umm, [formal], head. [belly laugh]
