Scenario: A substitute teacher discovers that the pension fund manager reviewing her retirement paperwork is her estranged brother who she hasn't spoken to since their mother's funeral ten years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] The receptionist said you'd be handling my, [shaky voice], retirement paperwork but she didn't mention your, [trailing off], your name was Michael Harrison.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I didn't know you were, [shocked], teaching now, or that you'd, er, moved back to the state after, [very quietly], all these years.

Character 1 [en]: I've been substituting at Jefferson Elementary for, [anxious], six years now, trying to qualify for the state pension before, [bitter], it's too late to make any real difference to my, [pause], financial situation.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] So, uh, according to these documents you need, well, twelve more months to vest fully, [slowly], which means we'll need to calculate your, [clearing throat], projected benefits based on current contribution rates and, um, market performance.

Character 1 [en]: [withdrawn] Just tell me if I'll have enough to, [exhausted], live on without having to work until I drop dead in a classroom somewhere.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Look, I mean, the numbers aren't terrible but, um, they're not great either, [frustrated], and with the way the district's been cutting substitute hours you might, well, [sigh], need to consider other options.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] Well, um, maybe if someone hadn't taken their inheritance and, er, disappeared to Wall Street while I was, [angry], left dealing with Mom's medical bills and, uh, funeral expenses alone.

Character 2 [en]: I sent you half of everything I had, umm, three separate checks that you, [defensive], never cashed because you were too, er, proud to take what you called, [mocking], blood money.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] You think money could have fixed what you did, um, leaving me to hold her hand while she, [shaky voice], asked where her successful son was every, well, single day for three months?

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] Um, I couldn't, well... [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: You couldn't what, um, Michael, you couldn't leave your, [furious], precious trading desk to say goodbye to the woman who, er, worked three jobs to put you through, well, business school?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I was in Tokyo closing a deal that would, um, set me up for life, and by the time I got your, [whispering], messages it was already too late and I couldn't face, er, coming back to an empty house knowing I'd, well, [choke up], failed her. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Failed her.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] Every single day I calculate risk and return for thousands of people's futures but I couldn't, [broken], calculate the cost of missing those last moments with her and, [very quietly], with you.

Character 1 [en]: So now, um, here we are, you managing millions while I'm, er, scraping by on substitute wages wondering if I'll ever, well, [melancholic], be able to retire. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I can help.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] After ten years of silence you want to, um, what, write me a check and call us, [sarcastic], even like nothing ever happened between us, er, like we're just strangers in your office?

Character 2 [en]: No, I mean, I want to help you understand the system, umm, maximize your benefits, maybe find some, [gently], supplemental retirement accounts that could make a real difference, and, well, [hopeful], maybe we could grab coffee after and actually talk.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] I still go to her grave every Sunday at two o'clock with, [tearful], fresh daisies just like she always kept on the kitchen table.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] I know because the groundskeeper told me someone's been, [emotional], leaving them religiously and I've been going Saturdays at sunset when, [whispering loudly], no one else is around to see me fall apart every single week.
