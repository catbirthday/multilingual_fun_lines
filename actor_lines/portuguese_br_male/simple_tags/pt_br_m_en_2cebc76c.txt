=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Um, I know what you do, er, I saw the news report about the, [shaky voice], investigation and I mean, I still have to treat you. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, those allegations are completely, [frustrated], false and I mean, my lawyers are already, [angry], handling everything while I'm stuck here getting, [bitter], medical treatment I desperately need, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [disgusted] Er, thirty-seven people were found in that warehouse, um, including children who hadn't seen, [trembling], daylight for months and you're sitting here, [very quietly], expecting me to save your life like nothing, [loudly], happened. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] You have a professional obligation to, [confident], provide care regardless of your personal, [mocking], feelings about my alleged business dealings.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I mean, yes, I'll do my job because, um, that's what separates us, [empathetically], but watching your platelets restore while knowing what you've, [hesitantly], done to innocent people makes me physically ill.

Character 2 [en]: [smoothly] Um, you know, those people chose their situations, er, signed contracts for work opportunities and I mean, [calculating], nobody forced them into anything they didn't, [dismissively], agree to through proper channels that were, [quickly], completely legal at the time.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Legal doesn't mean moral when you're exploiting, [whispering], desperate people who had no other choice. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [boastful] My businesses have employed thousands of, [proudly], workers who otherwise would have starved in their, [condescending], home countries without the opportunities I provided them.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Um, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, er, I've never questioned my duty to heal, [confused], until today when I realized my skills might help you, [very sad], continue destroying lives.

Character 2 [en]: [manipulative] You seem like someone who understands that, [warm], the world isn't black and white, [persuasive], that sometimes difficult choices create the greatest, [philosophically], good for the most people overall.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Well, um, my own grandmother escaped trafficking in the 1960s so I mean, [quietly], every word you speak dishonors her survival.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, I didn't know. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: The machine will beep when we're, [mechanically], done and then you'll leave and I'll spend hours, [nauseated], scrubbing my hands trying to feel, [broken], clean again. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: Perhaps we both do what we, [contemplatively], must to survive in this world.

Character 1 [en]: [bitterly] No. [short pause]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] We're finished here then.

Character 1 [en]: [professionally] Your platelet count should normalize within, [monotone], seventy-two hours if you follow the discharge instructions.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Um, will you report this conversation to, er, anyone because I mean, [threatening], patient confidentiality laws are quite, [slowly], strict about medical professionals sharing, [carefully], private discussions.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] I'll do what's right, um, just like I always have, and er, [clearly], that's all you need to know. [laugh bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [ominously] Sometimes doing what's right has, [darkly], consequences that reach further than we, [menacingly], expect, especially for those we, [whispering loudly], care about most. [long pause]
