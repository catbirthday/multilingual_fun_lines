1. [en] Oh! Um, no no, you're definitely in the right place! So, uh, first of all, let me just say I'm, um, really sorry for your loss. Er, let me just pull up our, uh, prepaid transfer system here and we'll get this sorted out for you, okay?
2. [en] Um, that's totally fine! Take your time. So while you're looking, uh, I can actually start with just, er, the account holder's name? And then, um, once you find it we'll need the account number which should be like, uh, something like PPA-7823-MK or similar format.
3. [en] Perfect! Okay so, um, I've got Margaret Chen here with account PPA-4451-JX and, uh, I can see this was, er, set up back in 2019. Now, um, for the transfer process—and this is, uh, pretty straightforward I promise—I'll need to verify you're authorized?
4. [en] Oh excellent, that makes this easier! So, um, let me just, uh, update that here. Wilson Funeral Home. And, er, I'll need your license number which should be like, um, FDL followed by some digits?
5. [en] No worries at all! Happens all the time. So, uh, FDL-8227-TX for Wilson Funeral Home, got it. Um, now the system is, er, generating a transfer authorization code which will be, uh, TAC-9916-MC and that's basically your reference for this whole thing.
6. [en] Oh yes! Definitely write it down. So that's TAC-9916-MC. Um, and actually, er, I'm also gonna email this to you but, uh, having it written is always good. So, um, the transfer includes, let me see here, the full service package valued at, er, $8,750.
7. [en] Um, absolutely! So I can see here it's, uh, the complete package. Let me just, er, read through this. It's got the, um, viewing services, the ceremony, transportation, and, uh, all the standard preparations. Everything under reference SKU-3847-PRM.
8. [en] So, um, great question! The transfer is, uh, basically immediate once I submit it here. But, er, the funds release to your facility will be, um, within 24-48 hours. You'll get a confirmation at, uh, let me see, transaction ID TRN-55831-QZ should appear in your merchant portal.
9. [en] Oh, I completely understand your concern! Um, so everything looks, er, perfectly set up here. No holds, no issues. The system shows green lights across the board. Uh, and just to reassure you, if anything does come up—which it won't—but if it does, you can reference case number CSE-7249-NP and we'll expedite it immediately.
10. [en] No no, you're being thorough and that's, um, exactly what you should be doing! These are, uh, really important matters and, er, you want everything perfect for the family. So, um, you're all set now. The transfer's processing under confirmation CFM-8839-RT and, uh, you should see everything in your system within those 24-48 hours. Is there, er, anything else I can help clarify?
11. [en] Hey there! So—actually wait—let me just—okay I got your account here, ACC-2947-WB, and between you and me? Wedding officiants always panic about this stuff.
12. [en] Right right, so basically, um, here's the thing—and I shouldn't really, uh, give tax advice but—your case ID is CAS-8842-NX and like, I've seen this exact situation probably, um, fifty times this month?
13. [en] So—no wait, let me just—okay so basically what most folks don't realize is, um, you're gonna need to track, uh, everything in your portal under TRK-3967-QM, and like, between us? The system makes it way harder than it needs to be.
14. [en] Hey hey, breathe! Look, I'm gonna share somethin' with you—document DOC-7731-PZ has all the backdating options. Totally legit, just... not advertised.
15. [en] Okay so, um, arrest? No no no—actually wait—let me, uh, pull up your earnings report, REP-5524-JK, and like, you're nowhere near, um, the threshold where they even, uh, look twice.
16. [en] Three thou—okay so basically, um, that's nothing, and I mean, uh, technically I shouldn't say this but like, under reference code REF-9981-XL? You've got, um, tons of wiggle room.
17. [en] Between you and me? Check section SEC-4472-BB. Has all the wedding-specific writeoffs nobody mentions—clothes, travel, even some meals.
18. [en] Yep! Long as it's primarily for ceremonies. File it under category CAT-8823-MV.
19. [en] So—yeah exactly—um, shoes, jewelry, briefcase—basically anything in, uh, what we call the, um, "professional presentation" category, code PPC-2234-TN, and like, most people miss that completely.
20. [en] Listen, we've all been there. Your confirmation number's CNF-7765-RD. Bookmark that tax guide I mentioned—you'll be fine!
21. [en] Oh, um, absolutely, yes, so I can definitely, uh, help you understand your coverage and, um, let me just pull up your account here—could you, er, give me your policy number or, uh, the account number starting with POL?
22. [en] Perfect, um, okay so I'm seeing POL-4429-BK7 here and, uh, just to confirm—this is for the, um, the comprehensive package you signed up for in, er, let me see here, September, and I want to make sure I'm, uh, looking at the right coverage details for you.
23. [en] Right, so, um, with your comprehensive package POL-4429-BK7, you've got, uh, quite a bit included here—there's the, um, basic coverage which is your standard protection, and then, er, you've also got the enhanced benefits addon with code ENH-7734 which gives you, uh, extended coverage for specialist visits.
24. [en] Oh yes! Um, so preventative care is, uh, actually one of the best parts of your plan—you get, er, annual checkups, routine screenings, and, um, immunizations all covered at, uh, one hundred percent with no copay under benefit code PRV-5512-A.
25. [en] Um, exactly, yes, no copay at all for preventative services, and, uh, let me just double-check here—yep, confirmed under PRV-5512-A, and, er, that also includes, um, wellness visits and basic lab work when it's, uh, part of your annual screening.
26. [en] So, um, dental is where it gets a bit, er, different—your plan POL-4429-BK7 includes, uh, basic dental coverage but it's, um, limited to preventative dental only, so that's cleanings twice a year under code DNT-0981, but, er, major work would need supplemental coverage.
27. [en] Right, um, so cavities—those would fall under, uh, what we call basic restorative care, and, er, with your current plan those are covered at, um, sixty percent after you meet your deductible which is, uh, let me see here, DED-1500 shows five hundred dollars.
28. [en] Um, yeah, it's actually, er, pretty reasonable compared to—oh! Wait, I'm seeing something here—you, uh, you actually have a credit of two hundred dollars from code CRD-8823-M that can apply toward your deductible, so, um, effectively it's three hundred for you.
29. [en] So, um, looking at the notes here under transaction TXN-994521, it looks like, uh, you had an overpayment from a previous claim that got, er, credited back to your account in October, and, um, it automatically applies to your next deductible amount.
30. [en] Oh, um, of course! I'm just, uh, really glad I caught that—it's easy to miss but, er, your account summary under SUM-7765-X shows you've got that credit plus, um, actually really solid coverage overall, and, uh, is there anything else about your benefits you'd like me to clarify?
31. [en] Right right, bulk tank payment. Let me, uh... what's the word... verify your account. Name?
32. [en] Got it, ACC-4892-JD. Yeah so, um, I see the issue here. Payment from, uh, yesterday's pickup bounced, and um, that's... hmm, that's definitely not good.
33. [en] Okay okay, deep breath. Your ACH failed code E47. Bank routing issue probably.
34. [en] Listen, been doing this twelve years. REF-2024-0311-BD, that's your case. We expedite these.
35. [en] So um, here's what happens. I'm gonna, uh... what's it called... priority flag this. Your processor gets notification TXN-8847-MP in, hmm, twenty minutes tops.
36. [en] Already sent. Check your phone.
37. [en] That's confirmation MBL-0622. Sign that, send back. Money hits by noon.
38. [en] Done hundreds of these. Um, your batch code BTK-4892-0311... hmm, what's the term... fast-tracked. So uh, actually might hit by eleven.
39. [en] Quick tip. Set up backup ACH. Form FRM-2290-X.
40. [en] I know. Rough season. But um, you're all set now. Case REF-2024-0311-BD shows, uh... yep, processing. Check your account at eleven.
41. [en] Oh, um, hello there, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—hmm, do you happen to have that reference number? I can also, er, search by phone number if that's, um, if that's easier for you...
42. [en] Right right, okay so, um, I'm seeing here—oh wait, is this about ticket REF-2024-88421? That was, uh, marked as resolved yesterday at, let me see here, 4:17 PM Eastern, and it looks like—hmm, actually this is interesting...
43. [en] Oh! Um, wow, so you're actually—you're calling to, uh, to say it worked? That's, er, that's really nice actually, we don't usually—I mean, most of the time people only call when things are, you know...
44. [en] Mmm hmm, I see, well that's, um, that's very thorough of you, let me just update the ticket here with confirmation code CNF-94412-A to show that you've, uh, verified everything is working as expected.
45. [en] Oh that's, uh, that's Agent Mitchell, badge ID AGT-7734, and I'm definitely, um, going to add that to his file because, er, we track positive feedback and it really does, you know, make a difference for evaluations and...
46. [en] Yeah he's, um, he's one of our senior techs, been here for, uh, let me see, wow almost six years now, and honestly between you and me he's probably the best we have for those, er, for those complex integration issues.
47. [en] No no, I've got everything here in ticket REF-2024-88421, your account ACC-50923-K is all updated, and, um, I'm just adding a note here that you called to confirm successful resolution, which honestly is, uh, it's making my day a bit better...
48. [en] Is there, um, anything else I can help you with today? I mean, er, since I have your account pulled up and, uh, I'm seeing you've been with us for, hmm, three years now so if there's anything at all...
49. [en] Oh! Yes, um, absolutely, let me just—okay so I'm seeing here that you're currently at gold level but with your, uh, your usage metrics you definitely qualify for platinum, case number UPG-2024-66239, and I'm just, er, I'm upgrading that right now actually...
50. [en] Totally understand, and, um, you're absolutely right, this should have been automatic at your level, so I've, uh, I've applied it retroactively to January first with credit code CRD-8847-PL, which means you'll see about, er, let me calculate here... roughly a $240 credit on your next statement.
51. [en] Oh, you're absolutely right to question that! The presence of that acidic hydrogen on the hydroxyl group would definitely kill the Grignard before it could react with the carbonyl.
52. [en] Well, we could use a silyl protecting group, sort of, like TBS or TIPS, uhh, which would be stable under the basic conditions. Plus they're easy to remove later with just some fluoride source, you know what I mean?
53. [en] Hmm, you have a point there, the thing is, like, for this particular substrate, even a simple acetyl group would probably do the trick. It's cheaper too, and we can cleave it with mild base after the Grignard addition.
54. [en] True, true, but remember the Grignard preferentially attacks the aldehyde over the ester - it's way more electrophilic. The kinetics really favor the aldehyde addition, especially if we keep things cold.
55. [en] So, I'd start at negative seventy-eight, anyway, then warm slowly to negative forty, I guess, just to maintain selectivity. We did something similar last month with that benzaldehyde derivative, remember? Got like ninety-two percent yield with minimal side products.
56. [en] Ha! You're probably [laugh hard] right, I'm being overly cautious again! But hey, better safe than dealing with a mess of byproducts, especially when the starting material costs what it does.
57. [en] Okay so, organozinc reagents, you see, they're definitely gentler, actually, but the transmetallation can be tricky. You'd need to make the zinc reagent from the Grignard first, or use Rieke zinc, which is a whole other headache with handling and storage.
58. [en] Oh wow, you already— [clearing throat] okay then, that changes things! We'll need to activate that zinc properly though, maybe with some iodine or TMSCl to get a clean surface for the reaction to proceed.
59. [en] Oh, that's [excited] perfect, like, dibromoethane is my go-to activator, you know! It gives you that nice color change when the zinc's ready, plus the ethylene just bubbles off harmlessly, no messy byproducts to deal with.
60. [en] For a fifty millimole scale, anyway, I'd use about five mole percent, honestly, though you could probably get away with less, sort of, if your zinc is fresh. The key is adding it slowly while monitoring the temperature - you'll see that characteristic fizzing when it's working.
61. [en] Perfect timing for that collision. Most organizations try to sequence those initiatives, but tackling both creates productive friction that accelerates cultural maturity.
62. [en] Er, that resistance is, I mean, valuable data - basically it signals they're recognizing the gap between authentic vulnerability and theater. Push them to design their own vulnerability protocols instead of importing generic ones.
63. [en] Fragmentation often precedes [cough] meaningful integration. Let those ERGs develop strong individual identities first; forced unity without authentic connection just creates surface-level compliance, not genuine collaboration.
64. [en] That tension is [very quickly] exposing whether your collaboration model requires presence or actual engagement. Document every friction point - they're revealing assumptions about how work actually gets done versus how you think it does.
65. [en] Excellent - their reversion patterns map your actual power dynamics versus aspirational ones. Use their resistance to identify which hierarchical functions serve legitimate coordination needs versus pure status preservation.
66. [en] Uhh, that divergence is, right so, diagnostically rich - like, it indicates you're achieving compositional diversity without, I guess, addressing systemic inclusion barriers. The discomfort reveals where your cultural operating system needs fundamental rewrites.
67. [en] Hmmm, failed innovation labs are, you know, incredibly instructive - anyway, they expose whether your organization actually has, essentially, the risk tolerance for genuine experimentation. Their isolation might be protecting your ability to fail safely.
68. [en] Err, no - actually, these failure modes are, here's the thing, exactly what successful transformations encounter at the eighteen-month mark. You're experiencing system immune response, which means you're actually changing something substantial.
69. [en] Umm, that polarization is, well, [whispering] potentially your most valuable signal - sort of showing where subcultures are crystallizing. Strong subcultures that clash productively often outperform homogeneous cultures that avoid conflict entirely.
70. [en] Track conflict resolution velocity, not conflict absence. If teams are surfacing tensions faster and resolving them with decreasing management intervention, you're building genuine cultural capacity, not just rearranging dysfunction.
71. [en] [breathless] Michael? Um, I mean, is that really—well, after all this time standing here in, [disbelief], work clothes covered in soot like we're kids playing in the, uhh, old manor again. [laughs shakily]
72. [en] [emotional] You disappeared after the, [breaking], fire—your whole family just vanished and I, umm, spent years wondering if you were even, [choking up], alive, and well, here you are cleaning my chimney like, uhh, some cosmic joke.
73. [en] [urgent] I tried to tell them you were with me that, [desperate], night, that your father couldn't have started it, but nobody would, [frustrated], listen to a twelve-year-old girl.
74. [en] [intense] You were never just anything to me, [fierce], Michael—you were my entire world before everything fell apart.
75. [en] [rising] We didn't lose everything—grandfather rebuilt the vineyard from, [determined], nothing and left it to me when he passed.
76. [en] [soft] Remember how we carved our initials in that oak tree by the, [nostalgic], old cellar before everything changed?
77. [en] [building] So you've been, umm, working in this area all along, just, [overwhelmed], miles away from where we used to dream about running this place, [voice breaking], together, and I mean, you never once thought to knock on my door?
78. [en] You're not defeated—you're, [fierce], here, you're alive, and that oak tree isn't the only thing that, [passionate], grew around what we carved into, [trembling], this world.
79. [en] [resolute] Stay for dinner after you finish—we have twenty years to, [warm], catch up on and a bottle of the vintage from the year before everything changed.
80. [en] [loving] Not living it alone though—I mean, not anymore, because, well, you're standing in my doorway and, umm, maybe that's the ending our story was, [hopeful], always meant to have.
81. [en] [panicked] Um, there's so much blood.
82. [en] Listen, um, I need you to keep that hand elevated while I, [frantic], try to remember where they keep the first aid kit because, well, my whole crew just ran off to find help and I'm, [scattered], completely lost in this factory layout, you know?
83. [en] [soothing] Just keep talking to me while I wrap this, [focused], tourniquet around your wrist to slow the bleeding down.
84. [en] Your color's getting better now that we've got pressure on it, [relieved], though we definitely need to get you to medical within the next few minutes.
85. [en] [confession] Well, I was actually an EMT for, um, three years before I got into corporate communications, so, uh, blood doesn't really bother me the way it, [gentle], used to when I first started.
86. [en] [steady] The bleeding's almost stopped now which is, [encouraging], a really good sign that we didn't hit anything major.
87. [en] [reassuring] Nobody needs to know you were demonstrating an advanced technique when the, [careful], safety guard malfunctioned because technically the camera wasn't even, [conspiratorial], recording at that moment.
88. [en] Look, accidents happen even to the most, [understanding], experienced people and making you look bad won't help anyone, [firm], learn anything useful. [sighs]
89. [en] [supportive] Um, yeah, let's go.
90. [en] [warm] Hey, we're all just trying to look out for each other here, [thoughtful], and besides, this'll make one hell of a story at the next, [lighter], company meeting.
91. [en] That's a weird thing to, [uncomfortable], say to someone just trying to buy, [defensive], organic chicken at a farmer's market on a Saturday, [cold], morning.
92. [en] Your daughter would be, [calculating], nineteen now which happens to be exactly how old I am, [realizing], but that's probably just a coincidence. [nervous laugh]
93. [en] [frozen] My last name is Mitchell and my mom, [shaking], always gets weird when I ask about my biological father who she says, [bitter], worked in food processing before he, [trailing off], abandoned us.
94. [en] [sharp] That's not what she told me for, [angry], eighteen years of birthdays you never showed up for, [accusatory], or graduation ceremonies you missed.
95. [en] [wavering] Um, she said you never even, [confused], tried to contact us, like, not once after you left.
96. [en] [stunned] I don't, um, understand why she would, [lost], lie about something like that for, well, my entire life. [voice breaking]
97. [en] [bitter] Well, um, protecting me from what exactly, I mean, from knowing my father actually, [cracking], gave a damn about me?
98. [en] Sorry doesn't give me back, [angry], eighteen years of thinking I wasn't worth fighting for when apparently you were, [breaking], fighting the whole time just to, [sobbing], send me a birthday card.
99. [en] Three years of Saturdays just standing here with your, [disbelief], organic chickens waiting for me?
100. [en] [exhausted] I need to, [overwhelmed], go process this somewhere that isn't in front of a poultry stand but maybe, [tentative], maybe we could talk again next, [hopeful], Saturday.
101. [en] [furious] That track you just, [shaking], dropped at midnight—the one that made everyone, [voice cracking], lose their minds—that's MY song you stole!
102. [en] [trembling] I sent you that demo, [desperate], six months ago through your label's submission portal—'Neon Prophecy,' remember that name? [bitter laugh]
103. [en] [heated] This isn't about being a wannabe—I have the, [passionate], original project files, the timestamps, everything that proves you literally, [accusatory], ripped off my work! [slams fist]
104. [en] Um, uh, you're scared.
105. [en] [determined] Well, um, I recorded our entire conversation and, [confident], I've got proof that'll destroy your reputation when this goes viral, so, uh, maybe we should talk about proper credit, like, right now.
106. [en] [steady] Your manager already knows about this because I sent them, [calculated], the cease and desist letter this morning before your set. [smirks]
107. [en] [triumphant] Check your phone—I bet they've been trying to, [knowing], reach you all night while you were too busy playing MY track to, [vindictive], thousands of people who paid to hear original music, not stolen, [disgusted], beats. [crosses arms]
108. [en] [cold] Um, that specific synth progression at two minutes fourteen seconds, well, [precise], that's my girlfriend's voice chopped up and pitched down—er, how exactly is that a coincidence?
109. [en] [firm] Like, your assistant is my ex-business partner who, um, [revealing], stole my entire hard drive when we split, and I guess, [bitter], he's been selling my work to, well, [harsh], the highest bidder—congratulations on being played.
110. [en] [resolute] Well, um, here's what's going to happen—you're going to, [commanding], publicly credit me as co-producer, pay me what I'm owed, and, uh, [final], we're going to have a very long conversation about your assistant, like, tonight. [extends hand]
111. [en] Please, I just need, um, [desperate], somewhere to hide for a few hours, I mean, they're going to kill me if they find me out there.
112. [en] [shaking] I testified against some, uh, [terrified], very dangerous people who don't believe in, well, [voice cracking], second chances or witness protection that actually, um, [bitter], protects anyone.
113. [en] [regretful] Look, I know what it's like to lose, [broken], everything you've built, your safe space, your, [trailing off], sense of security in this world.
114. [en] [gentle] I had to, um, [pained], send my daughter away three states over because they, well, [trembling], threatened to do things to her that I can't even say out loud. [choking up]
115. [en] [exhausted] Still standing, [hollow], barely. [sighs heavily]
116. [en] Why would you help me after I just, [confused], invaded your home and brought danger to the only, [grateful], place you felt safe? [voice cracking]
117. [en] [emotional] In my old life I walked past people like you, [ashamed], every single day without even making eye contact, [regretful], thinking I was somehow better or more deserving of, [breaking], basic human dignity.
118. [en] [determined] If I survive this, I won't, [promising], forget what you did tonight. [pause]
119. [en] [firm] I was a family lawyer before all this, um, [determined], went to hell, and I swear if we both, well, [emotional], make it through tonight, I'll help you fight to, uh, [passionate], see them again.
120. [en] [grateful] Thank you for, uh, [tearful], seeing me as human when I'm at my, um, [vulnerable], most inhuman moment.
121. [pure] Certo, é, eu posso—hmm, eu posso com certeza ver isso. Hum, só preciso do número da reclamação, ééé, deve começar com CLM e depois, ah, alguns números?
122. [pure] Tá, então, hum, puxando aqui o CLM-4492-BV agora e, ah—nossa. É, eu tô, ééé, tô vendo aqui. Negado no, hmm, dia 15. E tem—tipo, literalmente não tem anotação nenhuma? Isso, é, isso não tá certo.
123. [pure] Não não, hum, isso é—ééé, pera aí. Deixa eu, ah, deixa eu olhar mais a fundo aqui porque, hum, toda negativa precisa de um código, tipo DEN-alguma coisa, e a sua só tem, ah, nada. Isso não—hmm, isso nem deveria ser possível no sistema.
124. [pure] Espera, espera. Não—hum, não faz isso ainda não. Eu tô, ééé, tô ficando meio, ah, puto olhando isso aqui? Sua conta ACC-2004-PL mostra, hum, histórico de pagamento perfeito, nenhuma reclamação anterior, e aí eles simplesmente, ah, negaram em branco pra você?
125. [pure] Certo. Tá. Não, a gente vai—hmm, a gente vai resolver isso. Hum, tô escalando pra, ah, fila de prioridade do supervisor com referência REF-URGENT-8847. Eles têm que, ééé, eles têm que responder em quatro horas.
126. [pure] Hum, na verdade não? Quando entra, ah, nessa fila com REF-URGENT-8847, eles não podem—ééé, quer dizer, eles literalmente não podem negar sem, hum, sem te ligar direto e, ah, documentar tudo. O sistema não deixa.
127. [pure] Mais que—ah, mais que uma chance. Seu arquivo tá, hmm, tá limpo. Tipo, hum, o que aconteceu aqui foi, ééé, foi erro deles. Tô colocando anotações em todo lugar.
128. [pure] Hum, por enquanto mas, ah, mas eu também tô gerando, ééé, um rastro de auditoria? Número do caso CSE-7701-AUDIT. Então mesmo se—hmm, mesmo se alguém tentar alguma coisa, tem, ah, tem registro agora da negativa em branco.
129. [pure] Na verdade, hum, espera—antes de você ir? Eu tô, ah, tô te mandando email de confirmação com, ééé, tudo. REF-URGENT-8847, CSE-7701-AUDIT, e meu, hum, meu ramal direto.
130. [pure] É, hum, ramal 4429. Se eles—ééé, se eles tentarem qualquer coisa estranha, você, ah, você me liga direto. A gente vai, hmm, a gente vai conseguir a cobertura da sua van.
131. [en] Oh no. That's—I'm so sorry. Let me just—wait, let me pull up. Can you give me your order number or—actually no, email works too?
132. [en] Right right. So um, here's the thing—and I really, uh, I hate this part—the warranty on model BLX-4400 is twelve months. Seeing here your purchase date was, er, let me—September third last year. Today's October eighth. So you're at thirteen months and, uh, five days.
133. [en] Yeah so, ummm, I'm looking at order ORD-9923-LK71 and it's, uh, definitely September third. Trust me, I know how frustrating—I mean, my coffee maker died at thirteen months too. Right after warranty. It's like they plan it.
134. [en] I really wish I could. Like, um, genuinely. The system won't—it literally won't let me process warranty claims past, uh, past the date. Shows here expired status code EXP-1021. But listen, um, there might be something else we can do.
135. [en] Okay so, um, between you and me? Sometimes if it's, uh, if it's this close to warranty end, I can escalate to, er, what we call a goodwill review. Case number GWR-7766-MP22. Not guaranteed but, ummm, they sometimes make exceptions. Takes maybe three days?
136. [en] No no. You keep it. So basically, uh, my supervisor reviews—sorry, the team reviews cases where it's like, just barely past warranty. I put notes about you being at thirteen months, loyal customer, all that.
137. [en] Honestly? With it being, um, just one month over? I'd say you've got a decent shot. I'm putting in my notes that, uh, "customer purchased in good faith, minimal usage past warranty period." Reference number REF-4109-XC. I mean, I had a similar case last week. Got approved.
138. [en] Well, ummm, if the goodwill thing doesn't—wait actually. Let me check. Yeah so even if that doesn't work, repair service code RPR-5512 shows, um, forty-nine dollars for out-of-warranty fix. Versus hundred twenty for new one. So there's that option.
139. [en] Listen, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna push hard on this goodwill review. Like I'm literally typing right now that you're, er, you're considering just buying from our competitor next time. That usually—sorry, that sometimes helps. Ticket GTX-9988-LM44 submitted.
140. [en] You know what? Off the record? I don't blame you. But um, let me at least, uh, let's see what happens with case GWR-7766-MP22 first. I put my direct extension in the notes. 4-8-1-7. If they deny it, call me back. I'll find—we'll figure something out.
141. [pure] Opa! Então basicamente deixa eu só, hum, puxar sua conta aqui e—pera, na verdade, deixa eu abrir a tela certa—beleza então qual seu número da conta ou, é, telefone?
142. [pure] Perfeito perfeito, então achei você aqui, conta ACC-7734-NZ, e hum, nossa, é então tô vendo seu caso da semana passada, ticket TKT-889241, e é, entre a gente? Alguém vacilou feio aqui.
143. [pure] Não não não, então ó—e tipo, tô vendo as anotações aqui—você foi informado que isso ia pro, é, suporte nível dois em 48 horas, caso ESC-4419-B, mas ficou parado aqui, o que é, hum, nada aceitável.
144. [pure] De jeito nenhum.
145. [pure] Não se sinta idiota, quer dizer, hum, você fez exatamente o que devia fazer, e tipo assim, ó o que eu vou fazer—pera, deixa eu ver—é, então hoje eu tenho acesso override que é, é, timing perfeito basicamente.
146. [pure] Beleza então, hum, entre a gente? Tô escalando isso agora mesmo pra, é, não só pro nível dois mas direto pro—pera não na verdade—é, nível três, caso ESC-9902-VIP, e tipo, eles vão te ligar em, hum, duas horas no máximo.
147. [pure] Isso isso.
148. [pure] Escuta, hum, então basicamente o que aconteceu com você? Falha total do sistema do nosso lado, e é, tô colocando nas anotações—pera deixa eu digitar—código de prioridade PRI-8847-X, e tipo, também vou, hum, dar crédito do próximo mês de serviço, crédito CRD-2234-MM.
149. [pure] Não não, então ó, é, e não conta pro meu gerente mas tipo, quando eu vejo um caso que ficou no limbo que nem o seu, referência REF-6673-Q? Eu basicamente, hum, saio um pouco do script e resolvo direito.
150. [pure] Você não é—pera, deixa eu só—é então tá tudo certo, confirmação CON-9981-JK, e hum, sinceramente? Me liga direto se eles não entrarem em contato, só pede o ramal 4429, e tipo, vamos resolver isso de qualquer jeito.
151. [en] Oh! Perfect timing actually. So let me just pull up your account here and—got it! I can see your contract number CTR-9982-AL right here, and basically what I'm seeing is you've got about fourteen months remaining on your current twenty-four month agreement that started back in October of last year.
152. [en] Absolutely! So, um, let me break this down because, uh, I think I see what might be confusing here. Your contract ID CTR-9982-AL shows you signed up October fifteenth, and, um, today being December twentieth means you've completed ten months, so that leaves, uh, exactly fourteen months until October fifteenth next year.
153. [en] Oh! I see what happened here—so basically your early termination fee is calculated on a sliding scale, and looking at your account reference number ACC-7766-QM, you'd be looking at three hundred fifty dollars if you cancelled today, but that drops by twenty-five dollars each month you complete.
154. [en] Right right, I know that sounds like a lot! But, um, here's the thing—so I'm seeing in your file that, uh, you might actually qualify for our contract buyout program? Code PRO-2234-BB shows you've been a customer for, like, almost three years total across different contracts.
155. [en] So basically what that means is, um, we could potentially reduce that termination fee by, uh, let me calculate this... by about forty percent! That would bring it down to, um, two hundred ten dollars instead, and that's using discount code DSC-9901-XK which I can apply right now if you want.
156. [en] Got it.
157. [en] Oh excellent question! So, um, checking your equipment list under reference EQP-4455-TN, you've got our standard router-modem combo unit, and, uh, the good news is that's actually yours to keep—no return needed since you paid the equipment fee upfront when you started.
158. [en] Absolutely! I can see right here, transaction TXN-889234-LP from October shows a one-time equipment purchase of ninety-nine dollars, so basically that unit is completely yours whether you stay or go, which is, uh, actually pretty great because you could use it with another provider if needed.
159. [en] So here's where it gets interesting—your contract reference CTR-9982-AL automatically converts to month-to-month after October next year, which means, like, no more termination fees at all, and you can cancel anytime with just thirty days notice using form FRM-1100-CC.
160. [en] Oh! So, um, actually your rate is locked through the contract period at fifty-nine ninety-nine, but, uh, after that—and this is where I can help—we usually see about a ten dollar increase, but if you call us maybe, like, a month before it ends, reference retention code RET-6678-MM, we can probably keep you at the same rate or maybe even lower!
161. [pure] Ah claro! Eu posso, hum... como é que fala... providenciar esse cancelamento pro senhor hoje. Deixa eu só, é, puxar sua conta aqui. Pode me passar seu número de matrícula ou, hum, o telefone cadastrado na conta?
162. [pure] Perfeito, perfeito! Então tô vendo aqui... hum... conta número MEM-7782-JK91. É essa, é, mostrando a assinatura FitLife Premium? Só pra ter certeza que eu tô com a... a conta certa aqui.
163. [pure] Nossa, plantão noturno, isso é... deve ser exaustivo. Tá, então, hum, olhando sua conta MEM-7782-JK91, posso ver que o senhor tá no, é... como é que a gente chama... no plano de renovação automática mensal de R$ 47,99.
164. [pure] Não não, o senhor tá certíssimo! Começou com R$ 29,99 por três meses e depois, hum... depois foi pro preço normal. Então pra processar esse cancelamento, vou precisar, é, verificar algumas informações de segurança primeiro.
165. [pure] Entendo perfeitamente! Então, hum, pode confirmar os últimos quatro dígitos do cartão cadastrado? Deve ser o que termina em... deixa eu ver aqui... começa com 4?
166. [pure] Perfeito! Bate com o que tenho aqui. Agora, hum, preciso avisar sobre nossa... nossa política de cancelamento. Tem um, é, período de aviso de trinta dias. Então sua última cobrança seria... deixa eu calcular... 15 de novembro.
167. [pure] Na verdade, sabe o que é? Deixa eu, hum... deixa eu ver uma coisa aqui. Como o senhor não tem, é, usado as instalações pelos nossos registros aqui—último acesso foi 12 de maio—talvez eu consiga... consiga agilizar isso.
168. [pure] Tá, então, hum, boa notícia! Posso processar o que a gente chama de... de cancelamento por dificuldade. Seu número de confirmação é, é, CAN-5547-XP22. Isso vai encerrar a assinatura, hum, com efeito imediato sem cobranças adicionais.
169. [pure] De nada! Tô só, hum, verificando tudo aqui de novo pra garantir que tá... tá tudo processado certinho. Sim, confirmação CAN-5547-XP22 tá tudo certo. O senhor vai receber um email em, é, 24 a 48 horas confirmando o cancelamento.
170. [pure] Ah, que gentileza sua dizer isso! Tem, hum, mais alguma coisa que eu possa ajudar hoje? E só pra, é, confirmar mais uma vez—o senhor deve receber esse email de confirmação no endereço cadastrado, o que termina com @gmail.com?
171. [mix] Oh absolutely, um, so let me just pull up the licensing portal here and... hmm, tá, então você tá ligando sobre as taxas estaduais de distribuição ou a gente tá falando das, um, permissões de comércio interestadual?
172. [mix] Got it, got it, so for in-state distribution you're looking at license type ALC-2947-DS, que custa uns 1200 por ano, mas aí também tem as taxas de declaração trimestral que...
173. [mix] So, um, basically that gets you your distribution rights within state lines, uh, mas olha só—e eu vou, um, te poupar uma dor de cabeça aqui—você também precisa da, uh, permissão suplementar de fornecedor SVP-4421-B se você vai vender pra restaurantes e, um, isso é mais 450...
174. [mix] Yeah, I know it adds up quick, mas escuta, a maioria das cervejarias não percebe que tem na verdade um pacote combinado BPC-8829-CX que junta os dois por 1400 total, economiza uns 250 por ano se você tá planejando...
175. [mix] Oh yeah, um, so it's not really advertised, porque, uh, sinceramente tá enterrado na subseção 12 do, um, guia de licenciamento, mas eu sempre, uh, eu sempre falo pros cervejeiros sobre isso porque, um, sabe, cada real conta quando você tá começando...
176. [mix] And actually, since you're a craft brewery, você pode se qualificar pra isenção de pequeno produtor SPE-7761-A, baixa esses 1400 pra 975 se sua produção anual é menor que 15000 barris, o que eu tô assumindo...
177. [mix] Oh perfect, um, so you definitely qualify then, e, uh, olha o que eu vou fazer—eu vou, um, te mandar por email o link direto pra esse formulário porque, er, o portal normal nem mostra isso a não ser que você saiba, um, procurar especificamente...
178. [mix] Absolutely, that's why I'm here, pra ter certeza que você não desperdiça dinheiro com taxas que você não precisa pagar, e sinceramente o sistema é tão complicado que se alguém não te guiar...
179. [mix] Ugh, no no no, um, that's exactly what I don't want happening, então, uh, eu tô colocando uma nota no seu arquivo agora mesmo com número de referência REF-9923-CBL e, um, eu vou ser seu contato direto então se qualquer coisa parecer estranha você só, uh, liga de volta e pede por mim especificamente...
180. [mix] Yeah, ask for Jordan, extension 4782, e se eu não tiver aqui deixa uma solicitação de retorno com esse número de referência e eu vou garantir que você não pague nem um centavo a mais do que precisa, porque essas taxas já são ridículas o suficiente sem pagar a mais ainda por cima.
181. [mix] Ah é, hum, deixa eu puxar sua conta aqui... qual é seu employee ID? E, ah, na real? Esse negócio de desconto de uniforme é, hmm, é bem ridículo se você quer saber minha opinião.
182. [mix] E4-4829, beleza então, hum, tô vendo aqui que eles te cobraram—caramba, sério mesmo?—eles te cobraram 127,50 por, ah, what looks like two aprons and some kitchen shirts? Isso é absolutamente insano, tipo, these are basically required for you to even do your job.
183. [mix] Não não, eu entendo totalmente, hum, especially for entry-level positions where you're already not making a ton? Deixa eu, hmm, deixa eu checar uma coisa aqui no nosso banco de políticas, reference number POL-8829-XK, porque, ah, entre nós? Pode ter uma brecha.
184. [mix] Reclamar? Claro que você pode contestar isso! Então, hum, o negócio é o seguinte—and this is where it gets interesting—de acordo com a seção 4.7 no documento DOC-7741-RV, se você tá ganhando, er, como é que fala... at or near minimum wage, eles na verdade não podem descontar uniformes se isso te deixar abaixo do mínimo.
185. [mix] Sim! E, hum, olhando sua taxa por hora aqui no arquivo EMP-4829-STATUS, você tá ganhando, ah, 14,50 por hora? So that deduction definitely pushed your first paycheck below minimum wage requirements, o que significa, hmm, tecnicamente eles violaram o código trabalhista LBR-2947.
186. [mix] Então o que eu vou fazer—e, ah, não conta pra ninguém que eu acelerei isso—tô enviando uma solicitação prioritária de reembolso sob o número de caso CSE-9982-TM agora mesmo, e, hum, basically marking it as a compliance issue which means it goes straight to the top.
187. [mix] Já feito! O reembolso, hum, deve cair na sua conta em, hmm, deixa eu ver... processing code PRC-4451-RUSH significa, ah, 2 a 3 dias úteis no máximo, mas na real? Usually it's faster than that.
188. [mix] Escuta, hum, tem outra coisa—e eu, er, definitivamente não deveria te falar isso—mas salva esse número de confirmação CNF-8829-REFUND, porque se eles tentarem descontar por, ah, any replacement uniforms or whatever? Você pode referenciar esse caso e eles vão ter que fornecer de graça.
189. [mix] REFUND, isso. E, ah, na real? Esse negócio todo de fazer trabalhador iniciante pagar por uniforme obrigatório é só, hmm, é uma sacanagem total. I've been here three years and I still think it's ridiculous como eles, er, como eles tentam tirar cada centavo dos novatos.
190. [mix] Ei, todos nós já passamos por isso, sabe? E, hum, mais uma coisa—seu caso de referência CSE-9982-TM tá marcado no sistema agora, então se você tiver QUALQUER outro desconto estranho ou, ah, anything that seems off? Só ligar de volta, dar esse número pra eles, e, er, pedir direto pro time de compliance. Eles vão cuidar de você.
191. [en] Alright, let me pull up your account here. So I need your account number if you have it, or I can look you up with social—last four digits is fine.
192. [en] Got it, so, um, I'm seeing account number LRN-445779-B here and, uh, looks like you've had quite the journey with us. So basically there's a note here from October about a payment allocation issue, another from November about, hmm, incorrect interest calculation. Is that what we're dealing with today?
193. [en] Right right. So here's what I'm seeing—your PSLF certification form PSL-20240187 was submitted but, um, it's showing as incomplete in our system. Which is weird because you'd know exactly how to fill these out. Let me dig deeper here... okay so basically the issue is with employer verification code EVR-9982.
194. [en] Yeah so, hmm, I believe you—you definitely know this stuff. So what's happening is... okay. Your employer's EIN is showing differently in our database versus what the Department of Ed has. Transaction TXN-884521009 from your employer shows one number, but federal database shows another.
195. [en] There it is. Yeah so that's, uh, that's gonna be the problem and honestly? This happens constantly. So basically your qualifying payments from the last, hmm, looks like 24 months are all in limbo status under reference number REF-445779-24M.
196. [en] Unfortunately yeah. So the thing is, once an EIN mismatch happens, every payment after that date gets flagged. I can see here in case number CSE-1198745 that all your payments are there, they're just not counting toward your 120.
197. [en] Exactly. So, um, you're literally at 110 qualifying payments according to tracker ID TRK-556210-PSLF, and with these 24 in limbo, you'd be at 134. You'd have been forgiven over a year ago.
198. [en] Right right, I get it. So here's what I can do—and, uh, I wish I could just override this but—I can escalate this to our PSLF specialist team. Case number will be ESC-778904-P. They have authority to manually reconcile EIN mismatches but, and here's the frustrating part, current processing time is showing 45 to 60 business days.
199. [en] Honestly? I'm looking for any workaround here because, uh, you clearly know what you're doing. So there is one thing—document request DRQ-445779-A. If you can get your HR to submit an official EIN change letter on letterhead, referencing both old and new numbers, I can attach it directly to escalation ESC-778904-P. Sometimes that cuts it down to like, 15 business days.
200. [en] So basically, um, I've seen it work about, hmm, 80% of the time? I'm adding priority flag PRI-445779 to your account right now. Just email that letter to escalations at our domain, reference both your case ESC-778904-P and account LRN-445779-B, and, uh, honestly? Given you know this system inside out, you've probably got better odds than most. I really wish I could just fix it right now.
201. [mix] Nossa, eu consigo, é, entender totalmente como isso deve ser frustrante. Deixa eu só, é, puxar sua conta aqui... okay so I'm seeing claim number CLM-9847-DX, filed against your company ID MOV-4429-TK, e é, sim, é sobre um transporte de piano da terça passada?
202. [mix] Eu te entendo, de verdade. É, essas reclamações de dano são simplesmente, é, são muito estressantes pra todo mundo envolvido, e tipo, especially when you're already dealing with, é, você sabe, mudanças difíceis. Então o valor da reclamação listado aqui tá, é, mostrando como 3.200 dólares contra a apólice POL-7768-MV?
203. [mix] É, isso é... é, realmente parece muito alto. So let me, é, investigar os detalhes aqui porque, é, talvez tenha alguma coisa que a gente pode, você sabe, trabalhar?
204. [mix] Certo, certo. Absolutamente. É, então olhando a documentação que eles enviaram sob referência DOC-5512-QP, eles tão, é, alegando que tem dano estrutural na caixa de ressonância? E é, I'm seeing photos attached to file IMG-8823-A through IMG-8823-F, mas honestamente, é, algumas dessas parecem bem inconclusivas?
205. [mix] Por favor! É, acho que isso seria, é, really helpful actually. E só pra você saber, eu tô, é, gravando esses detalhes no relatório de incidente INC-2904-TL pra gente ter o seu lado documentado direitinho?
206. [mix] Nossa, é, duas horas? Isso é... é, caramba. So you were just, tipo, sentado lá com o piano deles e, é, ninguém te deixava entrar?
207. [mix] Pera, tava chovendo? É, okay this is, é, isso é realmente muito importante porque... hmm, deixa eu checar o formulário de reclamação CLM-9847-DX deles de novo... they didn't mention weather conditions at all, o que é, é, tipo uma omissão bem significativa?
208. [mix] Ah perfeito! Sim! É, definitivamente envia essas através do nosso portal na referência RFL-6690-WK porque, é, that could really help your case here. Quer dizer, se tinha questão de clima e eles te deixaram esperando, isso é... isso muda as coisas?
209. [mix] Então, é, aqui vai o que eu posso te dizer. É, since this is your first claim in, deixa eu ver... é, três anos na conta ACC-4429-TK, você ainda tá em, é, situação regular? E honestamente, é, com a informação que você tá me dando, acho que a gente tem bases sólidas pra contestar?
210. [mix] Claro! Quer dizer, é, I used to work dispatch for a moving company actually, então eu já, é, vi como algumas dessas reclamações podem ser injustas? Seu número de caso é CSE-1105-RB e eu vou pessoalmente sinalizar isso pra revisão porque, é, definitivamente tem alguma coisa estranha aqui.
211. [pure] Oi, tudo bem? Então, é... deixa eu só... puxar sua conta aqui. Que cobrança você tá, é, vendo exatamente? Às vezes essas coisas, tipo, meio que passam batido, sabe?
212. [pure] Ah cara. FitTracker. É, então, hum, eu na verdade—isso é meio constrangedor—mas eu tenho tipo três assinaturas que esqueci que tinha. Deixa eu... tá. Número da conta ACC-7829-MX22. Você contratou isso, é, parece que foi dia 3 de janeiro?
213. [pure] Isso isso. Então basicamente o que acontece é, hum, promessas de ano novo, sabe? E aí tipo... a vida acontece. Tô vendo que seu último login foi, é, 28 de janeiro. Praticamente, é, padrão clássico aqui.
214. [pure] Com certeza. Feito. Já tá processando. Seu código de cancelamento é CAN-9847-ZF91. Mas, hum, olha só—e eu provavelmente não deveria te falar isso—mas a gente consegue na verdade, é, dar crédito retroativo pelos meses não usados?
215. [pure] Então tecnicamente. O sistema mostra, hum, zero atividade desde janeiro. O que significa, tipo, que eu posso marcar isso como "serviço não utilizado" sob a referência REF-4421-QT. Você receberia... deixa eu calcular... 449 reais de volta.
216. [pure] Olha. Entre a gente? Eu, é, trabalho aqui há seis anos. A empresa prefere, hum, manter você satisfeito do que te perder pra sempre. A transação TXN-88273-KL tá processando. Deve cair no seu cartão em, tipo, três a cinco dias.
217. [pure] Ah não, eu entendo. Pode crer. Descobri mês passado que eu tava pagando, é, um app de meditação desde 2019? 20 reais por mês. Nunca nem, é, baixei o negócio. Simplesmente... esqueci. Essas coisas acontecem, sabe? Bem mais do que você imagina.
218. [pure] Não é idiota de jeito nenhum. Sério. Eu processo talvez, hum, uns quinze desses por dia? Sua confirmação de reembolso é RFD-6652-YN94. E olha, é, dica de ouro? Confere seu extrato bancário procurando qualquer coisa terminando em 99. Geralmente são assinaturas esquecidas.
219. [pure] Boa ideia. E também só... coloca lembretes? É o que eu faço agora. Enfim, hum, mais alguma coisa? O cancelamento tá feito. Reembolso processando. Você tá resolvido aqui.
220. [pure] Ah sim sim. Já foi enviado. Confere sua caixa de entrada. Confirmação EML-3998-WT22. Tem todos os detalhes. Data do cancelamento. Valor do reembolso. Tudo. E, é, sinceramente? Obrigado por ser de boa com isso.
221. [mix] Oh no worries at all! So basically I can definitely help you with that—let me just pull up our discount programs here in system DIS-9847-QR.
222. [mix] Absolutely! So we have both actually—the student discount is 15% off with valid ID, and basically senior discount starts at age 65, that's 20% off.
223. [mix] Oh totally understand! So basically all our discounts are registered under policy POL-2024-VK3, and like, you can verify that on our website's terms page.
224. [mix] Right, so for seniors we just need a government-issued ID showing birthdate—driver's license works perfectly. Upload it to portal SEC-7739-BD and basically it processes instantly.
225. [mix] That's such a valid concern! So like, our verification system VER-8821-PX uses bank-level encryption, and basically we delete the image after verification—never stored.
226. [mix] No, I really appreciate that! So basically being careful is smart—let me walk you through exactly how it works, step by step, okay?
227. [mix] Perfect! So first, you'd go to account settings, then click "Apply Discount"—that generates request number REQ-6632-AA—and basically from there it guides you through uploading.
228. [mix] Oh that's just for your protection actually! So like, the number REQ-6632-AA lets you check status anytime, and basically if anything goes wrong, we can fix it faster.
229. [mix] Thanks for understanding! So once approved—usually takes like five minutes—you'll get confirmation code starting with CNF, and basically the discount applies to everything automatically.
230. [mix] So unfortunately discounts only apply going forward, but like—let me check something. Your recent order ORD-9981-TM? Basically I can issue a courtesy credit for the difference, just this once.
231. [pure] Ah! Hum, tá bom então deixa eu só, é, puxar sua conta aqui e, hmm, vou precisar do seu ID de funcionário pra, é, pra começar—péra aí—você tem aí com você?
232. [pure] Beleza então, hum, tenho aqui o ID de funcionário 4827 e, é, ah! Tô vendo seu arquivo agora—conta de folha de pagamento PAY-4827-NRS—e hmm, então basicamente o que tô vendo é, hum, tem algo errado mesmo com seus últimos dois períodos de pagamento, né?
233. [pure] Não não, hum, a gente vai resolver isso com certeza! Então, é, olhando a transação TXN-892244-Q, tá mostrando que, hum, suas horas extras do—péra deixa eu ver aqui—do dia 15 até o 28? Elas tão, é, tão codificadas errado no sistema.
234. [pure] Nossa, hum, três turnos duplos! Tá então, é, é exatamente isso que tô vendo aqui mas, hmm, alguém registrou como horas normais no código REG-1122 ao invés de, hum, ao invés do código de hora extra OVT-1122, que é, é, uma diferença enorme no pagamento!
235. [pure] Entendi, entendi.
236. [pure] Tá então, hum, tô olhando seu histórico de casos—números de caso CAS-7761-A e, é, CAS-8892-A—e hmm, você tá certíssimo, essa é, hum, essa é a terceira vez! Então basicamente o que vou fazer é, é, escalar isso direto pra gerência da folha de pagamento com prioridade PRI-URGENT-01.
237. [pure] Sim! Hum, com certeza sim! Então, é, olha o que tá acontecendo agora—tô, hum, tô calculando a diferença e, hmm, parece que você tem a receber, é, deixa eu ter certeza que tá certo—R$ 1.847,23 sob o código de ajuste ADJ-9984-OT.
238. [pure] Ah! Então, hum, é porque, é, tô vendo que eles também não colocaram seu adicional de turno! Então basicamente, hum, noites e fins de semana deveriam estar codificados como DIF-445 e, é, não tavam aplicando isso também, o que é, hmm, completamente errado.
239. [pure] Certo certo, então, hum, tô enviando isso como solicitação de pagamento emergencial EPR-3345-X agora mesmo e, é, basicamente o que isso significa é, hmm, você deve ver na sua conta em, hum, 48 a 72 horas no máximo ao invés de esperar o próximo ciclo regular.
240. [pure] Não não, hum, vai acontecer com certeza! Então, é, tô te dando o número de confirmação CNF-88234-NRS e, hum, tô marcando isso pessoalmente no meu sistema pra, é, pra acompanhar na quinta—e hmm, se por algum motivo não processar, que vai processar, mas só por garantia, hum, você pode usar esse número de referência e a gente acelera ainda mais.
241. [pure] Ah, é, então basicamente deixa eu, é, puxar sua conta aqui rapidinho. Posso pegar seu, hum, ID de fornecedor ou número da licença?
242. [pure] Então, é, VL-4492, entendi, e ah, sim, tô vendo o, hum, o aumento aqui no seu aviso de renovação REN-7734-BX e, hmm, sinceramente? Eles provavelmente deviam ter mandado alguma coisa.
243. [pure] É, eu sei, é, hum, meio ridículo mesmo, na real. Então basicamente o que aconteceu é, ah, o município aumentou todas as, hum, taxas de serviço de alimentação lá em, é, outubro? Mas as notificações da conta FEE-4492-Q saíram, tipo, super atrasadas.
244. [pure] É, exatamente. Dois meses. É, ah, bem ruim mesmo.
245. [pure] Tá, então, é, deixa eu só, hum, ver quais opções a gente tem aqui. Sua renovação REN-7734-BX mostra, ah, um aumento de, hmm, trinta e dois por cento? Que é, hum, é pesado mesmo.
246. [pure] Hum, infelizmente sim, tá, é, mostrando trinta e dois por cento na fatura INV-889241-K. Mas, então basicamente, pode ter, hum, um prazo de carência que a gente pode trabalhar?
247. [pure] Então, ah, olhando seu histórico de conta no código de sistema SYS-4492-VL, você tá, hum, com a gente há, é, doze anos? Então acho que consigo provavelmente, hum, te dar tipo uns sessenta dias?
248. [pure] Não não, eu, hum, super entendo. É, ah, estressante mesmo. Deixa eu, é, também verificar se tem alguma, hmm, isenção ou crédito pela política POL-7756-C que pode ajudar?
249. [pure] Ah! Hum, tá então se vocês são, é, parcialmente sem fins lucrativos isso é, ah, isso é bom na verdade. O documento DOC-4492-NP mostra, hum, que pode ter uma, é, taxa reduzida? Tipo, hmm, talvez quinze por cento no lugar?
250. [pure] Hum, bem certeza, sim. Então basicamente vou, ah, marcar isso pra revisão com o número de caso CSE-991204-R e, é, alguém do licenciamento vai te ligar, provavelmente amanhã? Vai, hum, vai ficar tudo bem.
251. [pure] Então basicamente eu posso, é, com certeza te ajudar com isso. Deixa eu só, hum, puxar sua conta aqui. Posso pegar seu, é, seu número de pedido ou email?
252. [pure] Não—não tem problema, só o email tá ótimo. A gente consegue ver todos os seus pedidos por ele.
253. [pure] Então eu tô, é, vendo a conta ACC-7749-JB aqui, e hum, parece que você tem o pedido ORD-9621-KX que mostra entregue terça?
254. [pure] Não não, isso é, hum, muito útil saber que você verificou. Então basicamente eu posso ver que o, é, o rastreamento mostra TRK-886431-Q entregue na porta da frente às 14h47.
255. [pure] Hmm, então isso é, é, definitivamente preocupante. Deixa eu só, hum, verificar com nosso parceiro de entrega aqui. Número de referência REF-5528-PLM mostra... tá tá então pode ter um problema.
256. [pure] Então eu realmente, realmente queria ter, hum, notícias melhores aqui mas o GPS pin GPS-4419-X mostra entrega num endereço diferente. Não—não muito longe mas, é, rua errada.
257. [pure] Certo então, hum, o que eu posso fazer—e eu, é, sinto muito mesmo que isso aconteceu—número de reclamação CLM-7765-RT tá sendo aberto agora mesmo.
258. [pure] Não eu—eu entendo totalmente. Então basicamente, hum, eu tô marcando isso como médico prioritário, código MED-9921, o que significa, é, reposição acelerada mas...
259. [pure] Então o negócio é que, hum, mesmo com prioridade é, é, ainda são três dias úteis. Eu queria poder—quer dizer, se eu pudesse mandar pra chegar amanhã eu mandaria mas o sistema não...
260. [pure] É então, hum, o rastreamento da reposição vai ser TRK-3382-NW e, é, eu tô colocando todas as sinalizações possíveis nisso. Entrega terça, garantida, e eu vou, hum, monitorar pessoalmente.
261. [en] Oh no, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's happening. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out, okay? Everything's going to be fine.
262. [en] So I'm, um, looking at your account ending in 4782 and I can see... oh yes, there's, uh, definitely some unusual activity here. Let me just, um, make some notes in case number CSE-9914-TX so we can track everything properly.
263. [en] Right, right.
264. [en] I know this is, um, really frustrating and I'm so sorry this happened to you. But here's the good news—we're going to, uh, reverse all these charges immediately. Transaction IDs TXN-88512-A, TXN-88513-A, and, um, TXN-88514-A are all getting flagged for full reversal.
265. [en] So, um, between you and me? The system already, uh, flagged these as suspicious before you even called. We were just... waiting to confirm with you. Your new card, um, reference number CRD-6627-NEW, ships overnight.
266. [en] Absolutely.
267. [en] Nope! We'll, um, handle everything on our end. Your fraud claim number is FRD-10923-APPROVED and it's, uh, already approved actually. The money should be back in... hmm, let me check... within 24 hours.
268. [en] I mean, um, I totally get why you'd think that but, uh, honestly? Sometimes things just... work out. Your account's protected under policy POL-8829-GOLD which means, um, zero liability for you.
269. [en] Um, okay so, uh, here's something I don't usually tell people but... if you download our app and, um, turn on instant alerts under settings code SET-NOTIFY-MAX? You'll know, like, the second anything happens.
270. [en] Of course! So just to, um, recap everything—your case number is CSE-9914-TX, all three transactions are being reversed, and, uh, your new card ships tonight with tracking TRK-5542-OVERNIGHT. Is there, um, anything else I can help with today?
271. [en] Oh! So, um, like, I can absolutely see what happened here. Let me just, uh, pull up your account and—okay so basically your reference number REF-4492-NL88 shows, um, multiple transfers and that's... that's not right. At all.
272. [en] Got it. Got it.
273. [en] Okay so, um, I'm seeing claim number CLM-7739-XK here and, like, this is actually really interesting because, uh, there's a note that says—oh! Wait. I think I found the problem. So basically what happened was, um, the system flagged it as commercial but then, uh, processed it as personal?
274. [en] Absolutely yes! So, um, like, here's what I'm gonna do. Your policy number POL-885544-TY shows you have, uh, commercial coverage and basically I'm updating the claim right now. Like, literally as we speak.
275. [en] Oh wow. Okay. So, um, let me just, uh, escalate this differently then.
276. [en] No! No no. So, um, I'm not transferring you anywhere, like, I'm actually just, uh, changing your priority code to PRI-URGENT-2A which basically means, um, your claim gets reviewed within 24 hours instead of the standard, uh, five to seven business days.
277. [en] So like, um, technically I need manager approval but, uh, given your situation and the fact that you've been, um, bounced around for forty minutes? Yeah. I'm just. Doing it. Your new reference is REF-4492-NL88-PRIORITY.
278. [en] Right right.
279. [en] Okay so, um, here's the difference. Like, what they did was just, uh, add a note to your file but, um, what I'm doing is actually changing your claim status to, uh, expedited review with tracking number TRK-9983-XM44. So basically you'll get, um, text updates every step.
280. [en] Yes! So, um, like, I'm putting my employee ID EMP-7745 directly on this and, uh, basically if it doesn't process by tomorrow at, um, 3 PM your time? You call back. Ask for me. Sarah. And I will, like, personally walk this through myself.
281. [pure] Tá, então, hmm, deixa eu ver aqui... Tô olhando sua reclamação WRT-4429-XK e, é, eu acho—pera, dezessete? Isso não—quer dizer, isso definitivamente não tá certo.
282. [pure] Não não não. A gente vai resolver isso. Hum, então basicamente o que tô vendo aqui é, ah, alguém marcou sua reclamação como comercial em vez de pessoal, o que aciona toda essa, hum, documentação desnecessária sob o código de política POL-8837-C, mas isso é—isso tá errado.
283. [pure] Porque eu vou, hmm, passar por cima disso tudo. Deixa eu só—tá, então eu preciso, é, escalar isso mas, hum, entre a gente? Sua certificação de mecânico MCH-1922-A na verdade te dá status prioritário que ninguém, é, ninguém sinalizou direito.
284. [pure] Então basicamente, hum, mecânicos profissionais têm processamento acelerado sob o código EXP-7734-M, o que significa, é, você deveria ter precisado de, hmm, três formulários no máximo? Alguém realmente, hum, realmente ferrou com isso.
285. [pure] Certo, certo. Entendo totalmente. Então o que eu vou fazer—e eu provavelmente não deveria te contar isso—mas tem um, hum, protocolo de compensação CMP-9901-X pra erros de documentação acima de, é, acima de duas horas. Você vai receber um crédito.
286. [pure] Muito sério. Hum, então tipo, tô processando, é, deixa eu ver... um crédito de serviço de R$ 200 sob a referência SVC-4421-B, e eu tô, hum, tô acelerando sua reclamação original.
287. [pure] Ah, tá acontecendo. Seu novo número de reclamação é, hum, deixa eu só... WRT-4430-XP, esse P significa prioritário, e, é, você vai ter aprovação em, hmm, vinte e quatro horas. Talvez menos.
288. [pure] Pode. Rasga. Hum, na verdade, pera—guarda a página um com a referência REF-3318-K por via das dúvidas, mas, é, todo o resto? É. Lixo.
289. [pure] Esse é o trabalho. Bom, hmm, tecnicamente meu trabalho é seguir o protocolo mas, hum, às vezes o protocolo é, ah, meio idiota, sabe? Sua garantia é válida, reclamação aprovada, e, hum, sinceramente? Como mecânico você nunca deveria ter passado por isso.
290. [pure] Sem problema. Ah e, hum, se alguém perguntar? Você só enviou, é, os três formulários padrão. O resto foi um, hmm, um erro do sistema no ticket TKT-5567-Z. Tá beleza?
291. [mix] Tá bom. Deixa eu, ahn, puxar sua conta aqui e, é, hmm, qual é o número do pedido? I can probably track down what happened with your... o que era mesmo, um pedido de presente?
292. [mix] Ah. Certo. Então, ahn, deixa eu ver aqui... acho que achei, pedido GFT-4429-BX12? E é, você tá dizendo que chegou, ahn, tipo... qual é a palavra... comprometido? Danificado?
293. [mix] Hmm, tá então, ahn, puxando o rastreamento aqui, TRK-889541-QV, e é, sim, I can see there was maybe a handling issue? Deixa eu só, é, checar as notas do armazém rapidinho.
294. [mix] Eu entendo. Sério mesmo. Ahn, então olhando seu histórico de conta, ID do cliente CST-00847-ML, você está conosco desde, é, 2015? Isso é... pois é. Hmm. Tá, deixa eu, ahn, ver o que eu posso fazer aqui.
295. [mix] Certo, então, ahn, checando o relatório de incidente, número de referência INC-7745-PQ09, it looks like the carrier marked it as "mishandled in transit"? Que é tipo a forma deles de, ahn, dizer que provavelmente derrubaram. Maybe threw it. Quer dizer, é, manusearam com força.
296. [mix] Cristal. Ah! Ah não. Ahn, isso é... pois é. Deixa eu, é, hmm, puxar nosso sistema de resolução prioritária aqui, número do caso PRI-9982-XM44, because this is definitely not okay. Acho que a gente pode provavelmente, é, acelerar uma reposição?
297. [mix] Você tá certo. Totalmente certo. Então, ahn, deixa eu pensar aqui... hmm, what if we do something extra? Seu pedido de reposição, RPL-6621-TT08, I can overnight it, e talvez, ahn, adicionar um tipo de... crédito de desculpas?
298. [mix] Tá então, é, estou colocando, hmm, deixa eu ver o que eu posso... ahn, código de autorização AUTH-3847-QQ91... I can do the full refund PLUS the replacement? Isso é tipo, ahn, não é padrão mas considerando a, você sabe, a situação...
299. [mix] Sim! Sim, então ahn, confirmação RFD-2298-LK55 pro reembolso, e é, o novo sai hoje à noite. Ah! E, ahn, estou adicionando um, hmm, upgrade de embalagem premium pra presente? Código GFT-PREM-8891? Pra fazer, é, sabe, extra especial dessa vez.
300. [mix] Ótimo! Ahn, então tudo pronto, seu número de caso pra referência é, é, FNL-0156-PP42, e hmm, I've put notes that if anything goes wrong, eles devem provavelmente, é, escalar direto pra gerência. We'll get this right.
301. [mix] Nossa! Ah, meu Deus, tá bom então, deixa eu só—hmm—puxar sua conta aqui e, tipo, eu tô muito afim de te ajudar com isso, especially since you're in the field yourself, então, er, posso pegar seu número de ID de membro?
302. [mix] Tá bom então, consegui sua conta aqui, membro 558823091, e nossa, tô vendo—hmm—sua prescrição RX-7739-MED era, tipo, definitivamente pra ter chegado no dia 15, e tô checando o rastreamento agora, deixa eu só atualizar esse sistema porque às vezes ele não atualiza direito.
303. [mix] É, então, você tá absolutamente certo sobre isso, e honestamente entre nós—hmm—quando fica "em trânsito" por mais de 3 dias? That usually means it's probably sitting in some warehouse somewhere, o que é realmente inaceitável, especialmente pra insulina.
304. [mix] Não não não, você tá completamente certo de estar chateado, e tipo, isso é genuinamente inaceitável, então o que eu vou fazer agora mesmo é colocar uma liberação de emergência com código EMG-9982-STAT pra conseguir pra você entrega overnight da nossa rede de farmácias prioritárias.
305. [mix] Sim! Então, a gente tem esse serviço especial refrigerado expresso que, honestly costs us a fortune, mas pra situações assim onde é medicação crítica e houve atraso da nossa parte? The system should auto-approve it, e eu tô colocando a liberação agora sob referência OVR-4421-X.
306. [mix] Então, se eu enviar isso agora—e eu tô literalmente fazendo enquanto a gente conversa—hmm—você vai receber até as 10:30 da manhã amanhã, and I'm also seeing here that we can credit your account, o custo total desse envio mais um crédito adicional de serviço de $50 com código CRD-7765-APL.
307. [mix] Ah! Bem, quer dizer, eu ainda sou meio novo aqui mas tipo, eu só penso como se fosse minha mãe, sabe? And the confirmation for your overnight is CNF-8823-RUSH, e você deve receber um SMS em uns 5 minutos com o rastreamento.
308. [mix] Não não não, por favor não se desculpe! Tipo, você tá sendo tão compreensivo e, honestly? Most people would be screaming at me by now if their insulin was a week late, e eu realmente respeito que você tá ficando tão calmo mesmo sendo literalmente sobre sua saúde.
309. [mix] Exatamente! E entre você e eu? Our shipping system has been kind of a mess lately—hmm—tem tido tantos atrasos e eles continuam dizendo que vai melhorar, but I've been here three months and it's actually gotten worse, então eu sempre tento dar upgrade pra overnight quando posso.
310. [mix] Ah! Que gentil! Então, tecnicamente a gente não tem linhas diretas mas se você precisar de alguma coisa, reference this case number CSE-9901-MKT, e menciona que a Agente Sarah te ajudou com o overnight de emergência, and hopefully you'll never need to call again, mas o sistema deve marcar pra atendimento prioritário.
311. [pure] Tá, deixa eu só... hmm, puxar sua conta aqui... Desculpa, tá uma manhã bem corrida e eu tô só... qual era seu código de local ou, é, seu número de ID de anfitrião? Consigo te achar por aí e ver o que tá...
312. [pure] Certo certo, tá então... deixa eu ver aqui... TRV-8827... hmm, consegui puxar agora e, nossa, tô vendo o histórico de pagamento e sim, você tá absolutamente certo sobre os atrasos... Deixa eu só verificar o que tá, é, o que tá rolando com seu pagamento de novembro...
313. [pure] Na verdade, hmm, o que tô vendo aqui é... tá, isso é interessante... seu ID de pagamento PAY-11-9982-QV aparece como aprovado do nosso lado mas, é, deixa eu verificar a fila de desembolso mesmo... Desculpa, o sistema tá meio lento hoje...
314. [pure] Não não, eu entendo completamente e... hmm, péra, acho que achei algo... Então sua conta ACC-8827-VENUE foi, é, marcada pra revisão manual todo mês? Isso é... tá, isso não deveria tá acontecendo, especialmente não por três meses...
315. [pure] Tá tá.
316. [pure] Desculpa desculpa, eu tô só... deixa eu pensar aqui... Então basicamente alguém colocou uma marcação na sua conta, código FLG-0823, e tá forçando todos seus pagamentos pra esse, é, esse processo de revisão super lento que honestamente nem deveria se aplicar pra anfitriões de local...
317. [pure] Sim com certeza, eu tô na verdade... hmm, deixa eu fazer isso agora mesmo... removendo a marcação FLG-0823... e já que tô aqui, vou colocar uma tag de prioridade, tipo PRI-VENUE-01, na sua conta pra isso não acontecer de novo...
318. [pure] Claro! E olha, tô vendo aqui que você tá com a gente desde, hmm, deixa eu ver... desde 2021 pelo arquivo REG-2021-0447, fazendo terças à noite consistentemente... Vou também solicitar processamento acelerado pro seu pagamento pendente...
319. [pure] Então com o código acelerado EXP-11-30-A que acabei de enviar, você deve ver o pagamento em, hmm, provavelmente 24 a 48 horas em vez da semana normal... E tô fazendo uma anotação aqui sobre os três meses de atraso pra possível compensação...
320. [pure] Sim e na verdade, sabe de uma coisa? Já que você teve que ligar sobre isso... Tô te mandando um email de confirmação com número de referência REF-CS-99847 que tem meu ramal direto, então se tiver QUALQUER problema mês que vem, você pode pular a fila e me ligar direto, beleza?
321. [pure] É, então, eu vou apresentar às 14h, sabe, logo depois do almoço quando todo mundo tá sonolento, e é... os resultados preliminares com certeza vão causar polêmica. A gente tá basicamente sugerindo que tudo que pensávamos saber sobre o timing dos betabloqueadores pode estar completamente ao contrário.
322. [pure] Parece dramático, [pausa breve] eu sei, mas já replicamos os resultados três vezes com coortes diferentes de pacientes. Os dados mostram que a administração pré-operatória pode na verdade aumentar as complicações em certas populações, o que vai contra 40 anos de prática padrão.
323. [pure] O Henderson é o motivo de eu estar sinceramente nervoso—hmm, ele literalmente escreveu o capítulo do livro sobre isso, tipo, construiu a carreira inteira em cima do protocolo que agora estamos questionando. Ele vai presidir minha sessão amanhã, e não faço ideia de como vai reagir quando eu basicamente desmontar o trabalho da vida dele.
324. [pure] A questão é que os dados são o que são, basicamente, e ah, não posso simplesmente ignorá-los porque são inconvenientes. Ciência deveria ser sobre desafiar pressupostos, mesmo quando esses pressupostos pertencem a pessoas que controlam seu financiamento e suas decisões de estabilidade.
325. [pure] Ela tá sendo apoiadora, quer dizer, [gritando] publicamente pelo menos, mas cara, dá pra ver que ela tá preocupada com as consequências políticas! Ela fica me lembrando de ser "diplomático" e "respeitoso com a pesquisa estabelecida", que é código pra "por favor não faça inimigos poderosos nessa conferência."
326. [pure] É que eu tenho praticado respostas pra todos os ataques possíveis, meio que ensaiando com minha equipe, enfim, passamos por todas as críticas potenciais. Mas você não consegue realmente se preparar pra quando a identidade profissional inteira de alguém é ameaçada pelos seus achados—é aí que as coisas ficam pessoais, não científicas.
327. [pure] Tá, então, [curioso] como exatamente eu amenizo "seu protocolo pode estar matando pessoas"? Na verdade, essa é a mensagem central aqui. Encontramos um aumento de 23% nas complicações pós-operatórias com o timing tradicional, e dourar a pílula seria profissionalmente irresponsável, talvez até eticamente questionável.
328. [pure] É enorme, e é por isso que tenho que apresentar, mesmo que signifique me tornar persona non grata nos círculos de cardiologia. Se estivermos certos e não falarmos, pessoas podem morrer desnecessariamente—isso pesa mais que o ego de qualquer um, incluindo o meu.
329. [pure] A gente tentou isso, tipo, três pesquisadores sêniores olharam nossos dados, sinceramente, e todos recuaram devagar—hmm, um até disse "estou muito perto da aposentadoria pra essa briga." Ninguém quer o nome num artigo que vai começar uma guerra, mesmo que possa salvar vidas.
330. [pure] Bem-vindo à medicina acadêmica, onde estar certo é menos importante que ser educado, e onde desafiar o status quo exige ou estabilidade ou desejo de morte—e eu não tenho nenhum dos dois, só dados e um senso de dever provavelmente equivocado.
331. [pure] Isso é na verdade uma mistura fascinante de física e cultura! O intervalo de terça menor cria frequências harmônicas ligeiramente diferentes que nosso cérebro processa de outro jeito, mas a associação com "tristeza" é basicamente aprendida através de séculos de tradição musical ocidental.
332. [pure] Não totalmente - tem algumas propriedades acústicas universais em jogo. Tons menores têm mais harmônicos dissonantes na sua série harmônica, criando uma tensão sutil que muitas culturas independentemente associam com emoções mais sombrias.
333. [pure] Ótima pergunta! Os ragas indianos e maqams árabes usam sistemas de escalas completamente diferentes com quartos de tom e intervalos microtonais que nem cabem na nossa divisão binária maior/menor. Eles conseguem expressar emoções incrivelmente específicas pra que a gente nem tem vocabulário musical.
334. [pure] Exatamente! Imagina ter teclas entre as teclas do piano - é isso que muitas tradições musicais usam. O makam turco tem 53 notas por oitava comparado com as nossas 12, permitindo nuances emocionais incrivelmente sutis.
335. [pure] É bizarro quando você [espirro] encontra isso pela primeira vez, sério! Nossos ouvidos são tão, bom, treinados pro temperamento igual de doze tons que, na verdade, ouvir música microtonal de verdade pode parecer quase errado no começo.
336. [pure] Pura conveniência matemática, na real. Doze divide certinho por 2, 3, 4 e 6, facilitando construir intervalos harmoniosos, embora seja na verdade um compromisso - nenhum intervalo exceto a oitava tá perfeitamente afinado.
337. [pure] Bom, então, no temperamento igual, a gente basicamente, hum, desafinou levemente cada intervalo pra fazer todas as tonalidades igualmente tocáveis. Uma quinta "justa" no piano tá na verdade 2 cents abaixo da proporção matemática pura.
338. [pure] Não não, cents em música são, é... [amargo] centésimos de um semitom - é que, sabe, a maioria das pessoas nem consegue ouvir diferenças menores que 5-10 cents. A gente basicamente concordou em viver com música levemente desafinada por conveniência.
339. [pure] Quer dizer, na verdade é, bom, meio que libertador! Mostra que música não é uma verdade matemática perfeita mas, hmm, um acordo humano bagunçado que de alguma forma ainda cria beleza.
340. [pure] Porque nossos cérebros são, hum, notavelmente adaptáveis e, olha só, a gente busca padrões e basicamente encontra harmonia na imperfeição! Além disso, essas leves, é, desafinações na verdade criam aquele efeito "batimento" caloroso que faz pianos soarem vivos em vez de estéreis.
341. [mix] Well, floaters are actually pretty common, principalmente quando a gente fica mais velho, e hmm, na maioria das vezes são só pedacinhos de proteína ou células flutuando no vítreo—o gel que preenche o olho, sabe? Mas tipo, aparecimento súbito ou um aumento dramático de floaters pode às vezes sinalizar algo mais sério que a gente precisaria verificar.
342. [mix] Two weeks is relatively recent. Você tá [upset] vendo flashes de luz também? Eles geralmente aparecem junto com floaters quando tem envolvimento da retina.
343. [mix] Okay so, that's reassuring, você sabe, mas honestamente, eu ainda quero dilatar seus olhos e, err, dar uma boa olhada na sua retina. Às vezes o que parece benigno pode ser um sinal de alerta precoce de uma ruptura ou descolamento de retina, especialmente se você é míope ou teve algum trauma na cabeça recentemente.
344. [mix] Hmm, that's [curious] interesting timing actually. Até trauma menor pode, basicamente, fazer o vítreo se descolar da retina, e bem, isso é chamado descolamento vítreo posterior. Geralmente é inofensivo mas vale a pena examinar pra ter certeza que não tem ruptura.
345. [mix] I don't want to [hesitantly] alarm you unnecessarily, mas rupturas de retina não tratadas podem progredir pra descolamento, que é uma emergência médica. A boa notícia é que se a gente pegar cedo, podemos frequentemente tratar com um procedimento de laser simples aqui mesmo no consultório.
346. [mix] I know it sounds, ah, [gasp loudly] terrifying when you put it that way! Mas sério, é que o procedimento é bem confortável na verdade—umm, a gente usa colírio anestésico e o laser essencialmente cria pequenas queimaduras que selam a ruptura. A maioria dos pacientes diz que a antecipação foi pior que o tratamento em si, e de qualquer forma, a coisa toda leva uns 10 minutos.
347. [mix] Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, tipo, a maioria dos floaters são completamente benignos, sabe? Eu vejo provavelmente uns 20 pacientes por semana com floaters novos, e er, talvez 1 precise de alguma intervenção. As chances estão definitivamente a seu favor aqui.
348. [mix] So if I see a tear today, honestamente, a gente ia querer tratar dentro de, uhh, 1 ou 2 dias—basicamente antes de ter qualquer chance de progredir. Descolamentos de retina podem acontecer rápido, às vezes em questão de horas depois que uma ruptura se forma, por isso que eu nunca falo pra pacientes com floaters novos "esperar pra ver".
349. [mix] You did the right thing coming in now. Duas semanas não é perigosamente longo pra floaters estáveis, e você não tá experienciando as verdadeiras bandeiras vermelhas—sem perda de visão, sem cortina ou sombra na sua visão periférica, sem flashes de relâmpago.
350. [mix] That's exactly what patients describe—como se alguém tivesse puxando uma cortina escura sobre parte do campo visual deles, e [relieved] felizmente você não tá experienciando isso. Deixa eu começar com o colírio dilatador pra gente poder dar uma olhada direito e espero que deixar você completamente tranquilo.
351. [pure] Meu Deus, sim, sou eu! Eu faço trabalho voluntário aqui todo ano lendo os números de peito e os tempos. Número 487, doze horas e quatorze minutos! Você conseguiu mesmo, tô muito orgulhoso de você!
352. [pure] Faço sim, na verdade, virou essa, bom, tradição anual pra mim. Número 392, doze horas e quinze minutos! O negócio é que eu acho incrivelmente terapêutico ver as pessoas superando seus limites—me lembra por que a resiliência mental importa tanto.
353. [pure] Escuta, quer dizer, você acabou de completar, hum, 226 quilômetros de pura determinação! Número 518, doze horas e dezesseis minutos! Sabe, isso é exatamente o que a gente tem trabalhado nas nossas sessões—continuar quando cada parte sua quer desistir.
354. [pure] Isso é seu corpo processando uma conquista incrível. Número 423, doze horas e dezessete minutos! Olha, deixa eu pegar uma bebida de recuperação pra você no posto de voluntários enquanto a gente conversa—você precisa desesperadamente de eletrólitos agora.
355. [pure] Eu te vi em vários pontos de controle, na verdade, e sim, é... notei você com dificuldade no quilômetro 32. Número 551, doze horas e dezoito minutos! Mas olha só, você usou exatamente a técnica de visualização que praticamos—eu vi você fechar os olhos, respirar fundo três vezes, e continuar em frente.
356. [pure] A conexão mente-corpo fica tão visível em provas de resistência. Número 602, doze horas e dezenove minutos! O que importa é que você reconheceu o ponto de crise e aplicou suas estratégias de enfrentamento em vez de deixar o diálogo interno negativo tomar conta.
357. [pure] Claro que tava, quer dizer, isso é completamente normal! Número 445, doze horas e vinte minutos! O negócio é que você ouviu mas, bom, não deixou ele dirigir o carro, por assim dizer—essa é a diferença entre ouvir pensamentos e acreditar neles.
358. [pure] E olha onde te levou, né, você tá aqui como finisher de Iron Man! Número 389, doze horas e vinte e um minutos! Sinceramente, isso é uma evidência poderosa de que, sabe, o trabalho que fazemos na terapia se traduz em resiliência no mundo real.
359. [pure] A dor é inevitável mas, hum, o sofrimento é opcional—lembra daquela citação que discutimos? Número 512, doze horas e vinte e dois minutos! Enfim, você escolheu reinterpretar a dor como, basicamente, informação em vez de emergência, que é exatamente o que atletas de elite fazem.
360. [pure] Essa é a beleza da coisa—elite não é sobre se sentir invencível, é sobre continuar quando você se sente exatamente como agora. Número 478, doze horas e vinte e três minutos! Vem, vamos te levar pra tenda médica pra uma checagem rápida, e a gente pode conversar sobre essa conquista incrível na nossa sessão de terça.
361. [en] Oh, um, yes that's me! I'm really [delighted] excited to be here, you know, everyone's been so welcoming and I've heard, like, amazing things about the team culture here!
362. [en] Nice to meet you Alex! Well, I've actually heard great things about your team's work on, err, the infrastructure project—it sounds like you've built something, I mean, really impressive here!
363. [en] Oh absolutely, I thrive in fast-paced environments! So, I've worked at, like, three startups before this, and the thing is, I actually prefer when things move quickly rather than getting bogged down in endless meetings!
364. [en] Ha, I get that reaction [angry] a lot actually! But each move was strategic—I stayed at each company through major milestones and left on great terms when better opportunities for growth came along!
365. [en] I was leading a team of twelve engineers at DataSync, where we built their entire real-time analytics platform from scratch! We processed about fifty billion events daily by the time I left, which was pretty wild!
366. [en] Thanks! It required some creative architecture decisions, but we managed to keep costs down while maintaining sub-second query times across the board—optimization became my personal obsession there!
367. [en] That's exciting to hear! You know, scale problems are actually, uhh, what drew me to this role—I saw your blog post about, anyway, the distributed caching solution and thought wow, these folks really get it!
368. [en] Well, I believe in coming prepared! Honestly, I spent the whole weekend reading through your engineering blog because, hmm, I wanted to understand the technical decisions and, sort of, the philosophy behind them!
369. [en] I'm genuinely excited about the problems you're solving here! The way you approached sharding in that one post was elegant—I'd love to hear more about how that evolved over time!
370. [en] I'd love that! Coffee sounds perfect, and I have about a million questions about your microservices strategy that I'd love to pick your brain about if you're willing!
371. [mix] Oh, um, sure! Então, [very slowly] licenciamento pode ser bem complexo, mas basicamente, eu desenvolvi um framework que categoriza eles em, sabe, 5 buckets principais baseados em direitos de uso e restrições.
372. [mix] Right! Temos licenças perpétuas, baseadas em assinatura, modelos de usuário concorrente, licenças de site, e arranjos OEM—cada um tem estruturas de custo distintas e requisitos de compliance que afetam nosso resultado final de forma diferente.
373. [mix] Yeah, well, that's a common problem! O negócio é que eu na verdade construí um sistema de rastreamento que, hmm, consolida todas as datas de renovação e manda alertas automáticos, sabe, 30 e 60 dias antes do vencimento.
374. [mix] It integrates with twelve major vendor APIs, e pro resto, a gente usa automação robótica de processos pra extrair os dados—levei 3 meses pra aperfeiçoar mas agora tá totalmente automatizado!
375. [mix] Oh absolutely, so worth every [sarcastic] second, quando você considera que a gente tava, na verdade, sangrando dinheiro em auto-renovações que não precisávamos e, uhh, perdendo atualizações críticas em licenças que precisávamos!
376. [mix] Last quarter alone? Uns [sarcastic] 80 mil dólares em licenças zumbis—software que ninguém tinha tocado em mais de 6 meses mas continuava renovando automaticamente porque ninguém rastreava as métricas de uso!
377. [mix] Most companies don't realize until they audit! Eu cruzo referências de logs de uso com atribuições de licença mensalmente agora, e a gente cortou gastos desnecessários em 43 por cento desde a implementação.
378. [mix] Compliance is, honestly, where things get [very melancholic] really scary—uma descoberta de auditoria pode resultar em, err, penalidades que fazem qualquer economia parecer pequena, então eu construí verificações de compliance automatizadas que rodam, acho, semanalmente em todos os sistemas.
379. [mix] Two actually! A gente descobriu, hmm, que estávamos sub-licenciados no nosso software CAD por, basicamente, 15 seats e super-licenciados em ferramentas de gerenciamento de projeto por, tipo, 40 seats—equilibrou financeiramente mas legalmente são situações bem diferentes!
380. [mix] Exactly! Então agora eu implementei, sabe, monitoramento de uso em tempo real que, na verdade, sinaliza qualquer discrepância imediatamente e, bem, automaticamente submete pedidos de compra quando a gente atinge, umm, 80 por cento da capacidade em qualquer pool de licenças!
381. [pure] Ah, quer dizer, isso é totalmente normal! Melhoria de memória é, na verdade, algo que venho pesquisando há anos, e pra falar a verdade, a maioria das pessoas só precisa de estratégias melhores de codificação do que de recuperação.
382. [pure] Certo, então codificação é como seu cérebro inicialmente processa e armazena informação. A maioria das falhas de memória acontece porque nunca codificamos a informação direito pra começar—estávamos distraídos ou fazendo várias coisas ao mesmo tempo.
383. [pure] Exatamente o problema! Eu uso uma coisa chamada elaboração, onde você conecta informação nova a redes de conhecimento existentes—funciona muito melhor do que só ficar repetindo.
384. [pure] Digamos que você conhece alguém chamada Rosa—ao invés de só repetir "Rosa, Rosa, Rosa", você pode pensar nas rosas do jardim da sua avó, na cor rosa, nos espinhos, no Dia dos Namorados. Você tá criando múltiplos caminhos de recuperação.
385. [pure] Palácios de memória são poderosos mas precisam de prática! Começa menor com o método de associação—só encadeia dois itens com imagens mentais vívidas e ridículas que te façam rir ou sentir vergonha.
386. [pure] Pra prazos especificamente, é... eu uso o que chamam, sabe, de intenções de implementação—basicamente você liga a tarefa a, hum, um gatilho específico tipo "quando eu sentar com meu café da manhã, vou checar os cronogramas dos projetos."
387. [pure] Estudos mostram que intenções de implementação dobram as taxas de execução! O segredo é fazer o gatilho inevitável e a ação específica—não "vou me exercitar mais" mas "depois de escovar os dentes, vou fazer 10 flexões."
388. [pure] O método FACE funciona super bem—Foca no rosto da pessoa, Pergunta sobre a origem do nome, Conecta com alguém que você conhece, depois Emprega o nome três vezes na conversa naturalmente.
389. [pure] Ansiedade na verdade, bom, prejudica a memória de trabalho! Então eu ensino as pessoas a, é, respirar fundo primeiro, e aí basicamente, repetir o nome imediatamente fazendo contato visual—"Prazer em te conhecer, Sandra."
390. [pure] Com certeza! Meus clientes relatam 60 a 80 por cento de melhoria na memorização depois de só duas semanas de prática—a neuroplasticidade do cérebro significa que podemos literalmente reconectar nossos circuitos de memória em qualquer idade!
391. [mix] I've been doing this for, er, 15 years, e eu acho que [condescending] entendo as implicações melhor que, sabe, alguém que acabou de entrar no meu escritório 5 minutos atrás pedindo favores.
392. [mix] Look, I've handled delicate situations before—incidentes internacionais, espionagem corporativa, coisas que fariam sua cabeça girar. Seja lá o que for isso, a gente pode achar uma solução que não envolve tons ameaçadores.
393. [mix] Right, so, philosophical intimidation now—isso é refrescante, sinceramente. Mas olha só, sejam quais forem os mecanismos de aplicação que você tá, uhh, insinuando, eu tenho minhas próprias contingências que ativam se eu não fizer check-in.
394. [mix] And you're suggesting you're something else entirely? Porque de onde eu tô sentado, você parece com toda outra pessoa que tentou usar medo pra conseguir obediência.
395. [mix] Opportunity implies choice, e você não apresentou isso exatamente como opcional. Então vamos cortar a pretensão e você me diz o que você realmente quer.
396. [mix] Those files were destroyed in the data center fire three years ago—todo mundo sabe disso. Mesmo se existissem cópias, o que não existem, acessá-las exigiria autorizações que não existem mais.
397. [mix] You're fishing for something that genuinely doesn't exist anymore. Eu vi aqueles servidores derreterem pessoalmente, fiquei lá no calor até a segurança me arrastar pra fora.
398. [mix] Look, I mean, even if—e isso é, na verdade, um "se" gigantesco—fragmentos de backup existissem em algum lugar, reconstruí-los levaria, uhh, meses de recursos computacionais que simplesmente não temos mais acesso.
399. [mix] You've done your homework, clearly. Mas envolver Berkshire significa envolver a Diretora Chen, e ela não é exatamente conhecida por discrição quando crimes federais estão na mesa.
400. [mix] Wait, so, Chen's gone? Isso muda, uhh, tudo—sem a supervisão dela, o laboratório tá basicamente [quickly] operando numa zona cinzenta legal onde, sabe, certos pedidos poderiam realmente ser viáveis agora.
401. [pure] Ah mano, eu consigo, é, totalmente sentir essa energia que você tá passando—é [empaticamente] lindo mesmo como você tá conectando com isso, tipo, o universo é essa balada gigante e a gente tá aqui, sabe, curtindo frequências que mal conseguimos detectar.
402. [pure] Isso! E, é, quando aqueles buracos negros colidiram há um bilhão de anos atrás, eles mandaram, bom, ondulações que ainda tão chegando até a gente agora, tipo como esse grave do palco principal tá literalmente passando pelos nossos corpos nesse exato segundo.
403. [pure] A parte mais louca é que a gente tá falando de distâncias mudando por menos que a largura de um próton—imagina tentar ouvir um sussurro num show a um quilômetro de distância, só que um trilhão de vezes mais difícil.
404. [pure] Einstein foi basicamente o [muito animado] headliner definitivo que lançou esse álbum teórico gigantesco que levamos um século pra apreciar de verdade! Tipo, ele sabia que o espaço-tempo podia ondular e dançar antes de qualquer um ter o equipamento pra ouvir a batida!
405. [pure] Pego no flagra! Eu faço divulgação científica pra colaboração de ondas gravitacionais, tentando explicar como a gente tá literalmente ouvindo o batimento cardíaco do universo enquanto o pessoal tá aqui pela música.
406. [pure] Bom, na real, festivais são perfeitos pra isso porque, é, as pessoas já tão nessa vibe de sentir vibrações e, tipo, experienciar ondas—ondas sonoras, ondas de luz, e pô, sabe, por que não adicionar ondas gravitacionais na mistura?
407. [pure] De fontes astronômicas não, não—elas são fracas demais. Mas tecnicamente toda vez que você pula, você tá criando suas próprias ondas gravitacionais minúsculas, só que impossivelmente pequenas que se dissipam instantaneamente.
408. [pure] Eu entendo a frustração, mas pensa assim—a gente construiu máquinas tão sensíveis que conseguem detectar o próprio espaço se esticando por menos de um milésimo da largura de um próton. É tipo medir a distância até a estrela mais próxima e perceber se ela se moveu pela largura de um fio de cabelo.
409. [pure] Pois é! Eles usam sistemas de isolamento incríveis, múltiplos detectores a milhares de quilômetros de distância, e cruzam todas as referências. Só sinais que aparecem em múltiplos detectores com o timing certo são marcados como possíveis ondas gravitacionais.
410. [pure] Justo! Às vezes é melhor só sentir o grave bater e saber que em algum lugar lá fora, buracos negros tão fazendo sua própria dança cósmica que a gente tá só começando a aprender a ouvir.
411. [pure] As hierarquias taxonômicas atuais de vocês estão fundamentalmente desalinhadas com os padrões de conformidade ISO 15489. Estamos falando de um ciclo de implementação mínimo de 18 meses pra estabelecer esquemas de metadados adequados, integrar seus ERPs dispersos e alcançar normalização estatística básica em todas as verticais.
412. [pure] Bom, o que vocês têm é, sabe, uma série de repositórios isolados operando sem ontologias padronizadas, basicamente criando o que chamamos de entropia informacional. O tempo médio de recuperação de documentos de vocês tá 4,7 desvios padrão acima dos benchmarks do setor, indicando ineficiências estruturais graves nos protocolos de indexação.
413. [pure] Os cálculos de ROI mostram um retorno de 347% em cinco anos quando você considera a redução de multas de compliance, custos de discovery em litígios e ganhos de produtividade por eliminar entrada de dados redundante nos seus 17 sistemas de registro diferentes.
414. [pure] Utilizamos simulações Monte Carlo com, hum, 10.000 iterações baseadas nos seus [bem alto] dados operacionais históricos, sinceramente incorporando variáveis estocásticas como probabilidade de mudança regulatória e, tipo, índices de volatilidade de mercado! O intervalo de confiança é de 95% com margem de erro de mais ou menos 12%.
415. [pure] Não digitalização—enfim, isso é elementar—estamos falando de estabelecer, na real, um modelo abrangente de continuum de registros com, é... cronogramas de disposição integrados vinculados às políticas de retenção. Vocês vão precisar de taxonomistas dedicados, arquitetos de informação e pelo menos três gestores de registros certificados pra manter o sistema pós-implementação.
416. [pure] A complexidade do ambiente regulatório de vocês [articulando cada palavra] sozinha requer expertise especializada. Vocês estão sujeitos a GDPR, SOX, HIPAA e 47 regulamentações estaduais de privacidade, cada uma com requisitos distintos de retenção e trilhas de auditoria.
417. [pure] Arquivar é organização superficial. Estamos discutindo arquitetura empresarial de informação com capacidades de análise preditiva, mecanismos de classificação automatizada usando processamento de linguagem natural e dashboards de monitoramento de compliance em tempo real integrados com sua plataforma GRC.
418. [pure] Certo então, a Fase Um envolve, na verdade, estabelecer sua carta de governança informacional e conduzir um inventário abrangente de registros—isso é, ah, seis meses no mínimo. A Fase Dois implementa a infraestrutura técnica, mais oito meses, e a Fase Três lida com gestão de mudança e treinamento ao longo de quatro meses.
419. [pure] Eu entendo que é complexo, mas, sabe, considere isso: seus dados não estruturados atuais estão crescendo exponencialmente a 73% ao ano, basicamente dobrando a cada 14 meses—bom, sem intervenção, vocês vão atingir massa crítica em dois anos. Falha do sistema se torna não uma possibilidade mas uma certeza estatística com p-valor de 0,001.
420. [pure] Poderíamos começar com uma prova de conceito no departamento financeiro de vocês, [pigarreando] focando primeiro nos registros de contas a pagar. Isso demonstraria melhorias mensuráveis no tempo de processamento, taxas de erro e prontidão para auditoria em 90 dias, dando métricas concretas pra você apresentar para adoção mais ampla.
421. [mix] Ah meu Deus, você viu isso? Eu tava tentando parecer descolado passando por aquele grupo, and my foot just decided to betray me completely.
422. [mix] É, bem, quer dizer, transformar aquilo numa corridinha estranha foi, hm, definitivamente não foi meu momento mais suave. Acho que um deles riu de mim mesmo.
423. [mix] Eles são da minha oficina de escrita na verdade, which makes it [slowly] muito pior porque agora eu tenho que ver eles toda quinta. Me mata agora.
424. [mix] Tá brincando? Eu ainda, er, lembro quando a Sarah derrubou a bandeja inteira do almoço na sétima série, e, sabe, that was literally 8 years ago! People remember everything embarrassing.
425. [mix] Como é diferente? Eu basicamente, hmm, acabei de fazer uma dança interpretativa chamada "Pessoa Descobre a Gravidade" e, tipo, at least 3 people witnessed my shame.
426. [mix] Ninguém acha tropeçar charmoso! É que, honestly, eu tava me esforçando tanto pra parecer equilibrado naquela aula e, uhh, agora eu sou pra sempre o cara que lutou com escadas invisíveis.
427. [mix] Eu não tô [bored] sendo dramático, I mean, isso vai basicamente definir meu semestre inteiro! Toda crítica na oficina vai começar com eles pensando "ah sim, ele é aquele que, uh, esqueceu como andar."
428. [mix] Você não viu a cara do Marcus - ele fez contato visual direto comigo no meio do tropeço, and I swear I saw his soul leave his body from secondhand embarrassment.
429. [mix] Assumir como? Entrar e anunciar "ei pessoal, lembram quando eu, hmm, virei uma girafa bebê aprendendo a andar?" Isso é, bem, somehow even worse!
430. [mix] Eu sei que você tá certo, é que, um, [empathetically] esses momentinhos parecem tão enormes quando você já tá ansioso sobre se encaixar, sabe? But yeah, acho que, rir disso é provavelmente minha única opção agora.
431. [mix] Ah, que maravilhoso que você tá explorando, na verdade, essas modalidades antigas de cura! Medicina de plantas abrange, olha, um espectro tão lindo de remédios, desde chás simples até, quer dizer, preparações mais complexas que foram usadas por milhares de anos em diferentes culturas.
432. [mix] Bom, muitos médicos convencionais não são, sabe, treinados em medicina botânica, mas olha só—countless pharmaceutical drugs actually originated from plant compounds. Aspirina da casca de salgueiro, digitalis da dedaleira, e, honestamente, uns 40% dos nossos medicamentos modernos têm origem vegetal.
433. [mix] Eu sugeriria começar com, é, ervas adaptogênicas suaves [whispering loudly] como ashwagandha ou rhodiola, sabe, que ajudam seu corpo a gerenciar respostas ao estresse. Elas são super seguras, bem pesquisadas, e, na verdade, can support your overall resilience while you explore what works for you.
434. [mix] Então, adaptógenos funcionam, hmm, [whispering] modulando seu eixo HPA—that's your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, basicamente—ajudando a normalizar níveis de cortisol e, bom, apoiando a capacidade do seu corpo de manter homeostase durante estresse físico ou emocional.
435. [mix] Pra dor especificamente, cúrcuma com pimenta preta é fenomenal—os compostos de curcumina foram demonstrados em centenas de estudos pra reduzir marcadores de inflamação tão efetivamente quanto alguns anti-inflamatórios, but without the gastric side effects.
436. [mix] Com certeza! E quando você combina com outras ervas anti-inflamatórias como boswellia ou gengibre, you create this synergistic effect that addresses pain from multiple pathways—não só mascarando sintomas mas realmente apoiando os processos de cura do seu corpo.
437. [mix] A maioria das pessoas nota, na verdade, mudanças sutis nas primeiras 2 semanas, mas olha—plant medicine works cumulatively. A mágica mesmo acontece, honestamente, lá pela marca de 6-8 semanas quando seu corpo teve tempo pra, bom, integrar esses compostos e estabelecer novos padrões de base.
438. [mix] Exatamente! Pensa nisso, err, [joking] como namorar as ervas—you wouldn't marry someone after one coffee date, right? De qualquer forma, seu corpo precisa de tempo pra, sabe, construir essa relação e encontrar seu ritmo com esses aliados vegetais.
439. [mix] Que observação linda! Essa abordagem colaborativa é exatamente o que faz a medicina de plantas ser tão transformadora—você não tá forçando seu corpo à submissão, but rather inviting it into partnership with nature's intelligence.
440. [mix] Qualidade é absolutamente crucial—eu recomendaria [gasp softly] começar com fornecedores orgânicos certificados como Mountain Rose Herbs ou Banyan Botanicals. They provide third-party testing results, sustainable sourcing information, e as ervas deles são super potentes porque são colhidas no pico do tempo terapêutico.
441. [mix] Ah, muito gentil da sua parte dizer isso! Eu tive muita sorte de estudar com professores incríveis que me ajudaram a encontrar minha voz—music is really about sharing joy with others, not impressing them.
442. [mix] Precisão técnica é, honestamente, só a base—o que eu realmente, tipo, sou apaixonado é conectar emocionalmente com cada ouvinte. Every performance is a conversation between the music, the performer, and the audience's hearts.
443. [mix] Obrigado por notar isso! Eu, na verdade, passei meses explorando as cartas pessoais dele e, quer dizer, descobrindo a ternura por trás de todo aquele poder dramático—it completely transformed how I approach those thunderous passages.
444. [mix] Você tá absolutamente certo que é, ahh, vulnerável reinterpretar peças amadas, but the thing is, music stays alive through fresh perspectives. Cada geração de músicos tem algo único pra contribuir com essas obras atemporais.
445. [mix] Essa luta mostra que você se importa profundamente com integridade artística! The most meaningful breakthroughs often come after long periods of searching—sua dedicação em encontrar sua voz autêntica é o que vai tornar suas performances especiais.
446. [mix] Expectativas podem parecer tão, sabe, pesadas, mas elas também são, meio que, um convite pra surpreender as pessoas. When you play from your truth rather than their assumptions, você dá permissão pro público experimentar algo genuinamente transformador.
447. [mix] Definitivamente não é simples—it takes [short pause] tremendous courage to be vulnerable through your art. Mas essa vulnerabilidade é exatamente o que cria aqueles momentos mágicos onde todos na sala se sentem compreendidos e vistos.
448. [mix] Certo então, olha o que eu aprendi—esse brilho não é algo que te falta, é só que, tá dentro de você esperando pra ser liberado. Sometimes we need to stop chasing perfection, e começar a abraçar nossas lindas imperfeições.
449. [mix] Eu entendo completamente essa pressão—é, realmente, sufocante às vezes, mas, err, lembra que os maiores artistas da história foram muitas vezes mal compreendidos inicialmente. Your unique perspective is a gift, not a liability to be corrected.
450. [mix] Eu ficaria, hmm, absolutamente honrado de explorar música juntos—working with someone who [slowly] actually questions and searches as deeply as you do, isso inspiraria meu próprio crescimento também.
451. [mix] Bom, posso te garantir, quer dizer, [confidently] nosso engenheiro estrutural inspecionou cada rampa duas vezes, e elas tão classificadas pra aguentar 5 vezes a capacidade máxima que a gente vai precisar!
452. [mix] Então, nossos intérpretes são profissionais certificados nacionalmente que já fizeram centenas de casamentos, e a gente marcou um ensaio completo amanhã especificamente pra garantir que cada palavra da sua linda cerimônia seja perfeitamente transmitida!
453. [mix] Nosso local ganhou 3 prêmios consecutivos de excelência em conformidade com acessibilidade—a equipe de manutenção deles verifica cada instalação de hora em hora durante eventos, and we have backup portable units just in case!
454. [mix] Hmm, por isso que contratamos o melhor técnico de áudio do estado que, é que, especializa em tecnologia de assistência auditiva—he's basically guaranteed crystal clear sound for every single guest, independente das necessidades auditivas deles!
455. [mix] Ah querido, [delighted] a gente criou plataformas elevadas com linhas de visão perfeitas especificamente pra usuários de cadeira de rodas—your grandmother will have the absolute best view in the entire venue, eu te prometo isso!
456. [mix] Ah, cada cardápio em braile foi, quer dizer, verificado três vezes pelo nosso consultor cego que, na verdade, acontece de ser um revisor profissional—we're setting the gold standard for inclusive wedding materials here!
457. [mix] Então, a gente designou um espaço com controle de temperatura, hm, estações de água fresca, áreas de descanso super confortáveis, and we've got a veterinary technician on standby throughout the entire event!
458. [mix] Olha, essas faixas são, né, instaladas segundo padrões internacionais de segurança e, honestamente, foram especificamente projetadas com bordas chanfradas que tornam tropeçar praticamente impossível—we're creating the safest possible environment!
459. [mix] Nossa equipe de buffet tem estações de preparação separadas pra cada necessidade dietética, utensílios codificados por cor, e cartões de ingredientes detalhados em cada estação—this is going to be the most thoughtfully accommodating reception anyone's ever attended!
460. [mix] Escuta, sua preocupação mostra o quanto você se importa, que [joking] é por isso que eu preparei um plano de contingência de 47 páginas, mas honestamente, this wedding will be a beautiful celebration where absolutely everyone can participate fully and joyfully!
461. [mix] Ótima pergunta! A teoria da difusão de inovações explica [chuckle] exatamente esse processo—mostra como novas ideias, tecnologias, ou práticas gradualmente são adotadas por uma população ao longo do tempo, through specific channels and stages.
462. [mix] Bom, é aí que entram as categorias de adotantes do Rogers, sabe, que classificam pessoas baseadas na, uh, disposição delas pra abraçar mudanças—os inovadores pulam primeiro, tipo representando uns 2.5% da população, followed by early adopters at 13.5%.
463. [mix] Os inovadores são tomadores de risco com alta liquidez financeira que conseguem lidar com possíveis falhas, enquanto os early adopters são mais como líderes de opinião, who carefully evaluate innovations but have the respect to influence others' decisions.
464. [mix] A maioria inicial, uns 34%, adota inovações quando vê prova de sucesso, enquanto a maioria tardia, outros 34%, only adopts when social pressure mounts or the old way becomes impractical.
465. [mix] Exatamente—os retardatários compõem os últimos 16%, e eles são tradicionalmente orientados, often skeptical of change, e normalmente só adotam quando não tem absolutamente nenhuma outra escolha.
466. [mix] Interessante essa autoavaliação! Keep in mind that people can be innovators in some domains while being late adopters in others—alguém pode abraçar tecnologia nova instantaneamente mas resistir mudanças na rotina de exercícios ou hábitos alimentares.
467. [mix] Então, o processo segue uma curva S onde, um, a adoção começa devagar com os inovadores, daí, a coisa é que, acelera rapidamente através dos early adopters e da maioria, finalmente, é, diminuindo com os retardatários.
468. [mix] Rogers identificou cinco atributos-chave que, bom, [hesitantly] influenciam as taxas de adoção—vantagem relativa sobre soluções existentes, compatibilidade com valores e práticas atuais, nível de complexidade, testabilidade, and observability of results.
469. [mix] Claro! Os smartphones demonstraram todos os cinco atributos perfeitamente, sabe—eles ofereceram vantagens claras sobre os flip phones, se encaixaram nas necessidades de comunicação existentes, ficaram, na verdade, mais simples de usar com o tempo, permitiram, hmm, trial periods through stores, e os benefícios deles eram altamente visíveis pros outros.
470. [mix] As organizações devem, uh, mirar nos early adopters primeiro como líderes de opinião, demonstrar benefícios claros, é que, provide trials or pilots, reduzir complexidade através de treinamento, e, honestamente, tornar os sucessos altamente visíveis pra encorajar a maioria a seguir!
471. [mix] Oh that's such a fundamental question! [very excited] Eu acho que determinação é absolutamente algo que a gente pode cultivar, é tipo um músculo que fica mais forte com prática, embora algumas pessoas possam ter tendências naturais que facilitam o desenvolvimento.
472. [mix] Fair enough! Mas olha a pesquisa sobre garra da Angela Duckworth, ela descobriu que perseverança e paixão por objetivos de longo prazo podem ser desenvolvidas através de prática deliberada e encontrando um propósito mais profundo no que a gente faz.
473. [mix] That fizzling out is actually totally normal, determinação não é sobre nunca falhar, é sobre voltar pro seu objetivo mesmo depois de tropeçar, e talvez ajustar sua abordagem baseado no que você aprendeu desses contratempos.
474. [mix] Sure, there are individual differences, honestamente, mas, uh, a maior parte do que parece motivação natural é, a questão é, na verdade comportamento aprendido de experiências precoces, modelos de referência, e ambientes que ou recompensaram ou desencorajaram persistência.
475. [mix] Start small, hmm, with tiny commitments you can actually keep, escova os dentes com sua mão não-dominante por uma semana, faz 5 flexões toda manhã, enfim, esses micro-hábitos constroem as vias neurais pra uma determinação maior.
476. [mix] I get the skepticism, sabe, mas a neurociência mostra que, uhh, pequenas ações consistentes literalmente reconectam nossos cérebros, é só que a gente frequentemente tenta mudar demais rápido demais e aí fica derrotado quando não consegue sustentar.
477. [mix] Ah, disruptions are inevitable, sério, e a chave é planejar pra elas, ter o que os pesquisadores chamam de "intenções de implementação", que são basicamente planos se-então pra obstáculos, bom, aumenta drasticamente suas chances de se recuperar.
478. [mix] Not planning for failure exactly, but planning for reality! É sobre reconhecer que perfeição não é o objetivo, consistência ao longo do tempo importa muito mais que execução perfeita, e autocompaixão quando você escorrega na verdade te ajuda a voltar aos trilhos mais rápido.
479. [mix] That self-concept is probably your biggest barrier, nossas identidades moldam nossas ações, então se você começar a se dizer "eu sou alguém que termina o que começa" mesmo em coisas pequenas, seu comportamento começa a se alinhar com essa nova história.
480. [mix] Absolutely yes! Escolhe uma coisa pequena que importa pra você, se compromete com ela por apenas 2 semanas, e percebe como até essa pequena vitória começa a mudar sua relação com determinação, ação cria evidência de que você pode confiar em si mesmo.
481. [mix] Essa é uma daquelas questões eternas que filósofos e psicólogos debatem há séculos. Eu acredito que podemos mudar nossos padrões e comportamentos, embora nosso temperamento básico permaneça relativamente estável—é mais sobre aprender a trabalhar com quem somos do que virar uma pessoa completamente diferente.
482. [mix] Ah, eu entendo totalmente esse sentimento, sério, porque, é, mudança autêntica não significa se forçar num molde que não serve—é mais sobre, sei lá, expandir sua zona de conforto gradualmente enquanto ainda respeita suas inclinações naturais.
483. [mix] Networking não precisa significar trabalhar uma sala cheia de estranhos em coquetéis, though. Alguns dos introvertidos mais bem-sucedidos que eu conheço constroem conexões profundas um-a-um através de cafés, comunidades online, ou projetos colaborativos—quality really does beat quantity here.
484. [mix] Né? Então, a coisa é que a gente fica preso pensando que mudança significa, ahh, virar nosso oposto, but actually, sustainable change happens when we find ways to achieve our goals that align with our natural strengths.
485. [mix] Comparação é mesmo o ladrão da alegria aqui. Todo mundo tá lutando com alguma coisa, even those people who seem totally at ease—eles só tiveram prática diferente ou tão lidando com desafios diferentes que você não consegue ver.
486. [mix] Não aceitar ser esquisito, não—mais tipo, hmm, reconhecer que o que parece esquisito pra você pode ser, meio que, seu estilo autêntico que ainda não achou seu ritmo, sabe, and that's completely workable.
487. [mix] Terapia pode ser incrivelmente útil, na verdade, especialmente pra entender padrões e, é, desenvolver novas estratégias—cognitive behavioral therapy in particular has, enfim, ferramentas ótimas pra gradualmente mudar comportamentos trabalhando com seu temperamento em vez de contra ele.
488. [mix] Essa é uma distinção super importante de fazer. Mudança real e duradoura vem de motivação interna—when you can clearly articulate why YOU want something different, não porque outra pessoa acha que você deveria ser diferente.
489. [mix] Famílias projetam seus próprios medos e aspirações, honestly, mas ambição parece diferente pra cada um—algumas pessoas querem, tipo, subir escadas corporativas enquanto outras, bem, encontram realização em maestria, criatividade, ou equilíbrio de vida, and all of those are equally valid paths.
490. [mix] Exatamente, e é aí que, umm, o trabalho real começa—sentar com você mesmo tempo suficiente pra [long pause] distinguir entre seus desejos autênticos e, sabe, todos os "deveria" que você internalizou de outras pessoas.
491. [pure] Ah sim, é, já completei uns 85% delas, meio que adiantado no cronograma, pra falar a verdade! Tínhamos 28 alunos pra revisar dessa vez, sabe, e já terminei 24, o que é uma baita conquista considerando tudo mais que tá rolando.
492. [pure] Bom, cada revisão leva [encantado] mais ou menos umas 2 a 3 horas quando você conta, é, a documentação, as consultas com os pais, e atualizar todos os objetivos e adaptações—mas sinceramente, ver o progresso das crianças faz valer cada minuto!
493. [pure] Com certeza, a gente usa múltiplos pontos de [pausa] dados pra cada aluno. Pra fluência de leitura, medimos palavras por minuto semanalmente, e pra matemática acompanhamos a precisão na resolução de problemas em 10 áreas de habilidades diferentes—isso dá uma visão super completa de onde cada criança está.
494. [pure] É bem extenso mesmo! Só no semestre passado coletei mais de 3.000 pontos de dados individuais pra toda minha turma, mas ter essas informações detalhadas me ajuda a defender exatamente o que cada aluno precisa.
495. [pure] Ah, [suspiro suave] que gentileza você falar isso! Essa semana tô particularmente orgulhoso porque três dos meus alunos atingiram as metas trimestrais antes do prazo—um melhorou seu nível de leitura em 1,5 séries em apenas 8 semanas!
496. [pure] Então, atualmente tenho 35 alunos, sinceramente, o que é meio acima do máximo recomendado de 28, mas cada um merece atenção individualizada. Passo umas 12 horas por semana em atendimento direto e outras 15 em planejamento e documentação.
497. [pure] É que também tem as reuniões—ahn, eu faço em média umas 4 conferências com pais e, sei lá, umas 6 reuniões de equipe por semana. Mas quando você vê uma criança que não conseguia ler de repente decodificar sua primeira frase, essas semanas de 60 horas valem totalmente a pena!
498. [pure] Pois é, pode ser intenso, mas sabe, dividir em partes ajuda—eu programo pausas de 15 minutos a cada 2 horas e protejo mesmo meu horário de almoço. Autocuidado não é egoísmo quando você apoia 35 famílias que dependem de você estar no seu melhor.
499. [pure] Ano passado 78% dos meus alunos atingiram ou superaram as metas do PEI, o que ficou acima da média do distrito de 72%. Os outros 22% ainda fizeram progresso significativo, só precisaram de metas modificadas—cada criança tem seu próprio ritmo.
500. [pure] Obrigado, foi uma baita jornada conseguir [aliviado] aumentar nossa taxa de sucesso de 65% três anos atrás! O acompanhamento consistente de dados, engajamento familiar, e colaboração com os professores do ensino regular fizeram toda a diferença—trabalho em equipe realmente funciona na educação especial.
501. [mix] [gentle] Sem pressa.
502. [mix] [curious] Você pode me ajudar a entender como é, [thoughtful], quando os padrões tomam conta da sua, [careful], atenção desse jeito?
503. [mix] Isso parece ao mesmo tempo extraordinário e, [concerned], assustador. [soft exhale]
504. [mix] [understanding] O dom e o desafio não são, [recognizing], coisas separadas né—they're woven together in ways that, [compassionate], a maioria das pessoas não consegue ver. [pauses]
505. [mix] [gentle] Na sua aplicação você mencionou dificuldade com, [reading], rotinas diárias, but you can recall every stock price from, [impressed], a última década.
506. [mix] [thoughtful] Então pra você, as relações matemáticas complexas são na verdade, [realizing], mais simples do que o que a maioria considera interações sociais básicas, [contemplative], é isso? [soft]
507. [mix] [warm] Sabe, em todos os meus anos fazendo isso, [reflective], I've never had someone explain it quite so clearly—the way extraordinary ability can, [understanding], existir junto com desafios profundos que a maioria das pessoas considera, [moved], normais. [pause]
508. [mix] [sincere] Eu mais que acredito em você—é, acho que seu depoimento hoje, bem, me ajudou a entender algo fundamental sobre, [touched], como definimos deficiência e habilidade, sabe? [emotional]
509. [mix] Bem, o que eu tô vendo é alguém que experimenta o mundo através de, é, uma lente completamente diferente, e, é, that lens brings both remarkable insights and, er, desafios reais.
510. [mix] [compassionate] Bem, eu vou, é, aprovar sua aplicação, e, é, quero que você saiba que não é por pena mas por, [firm], reconhecimento de que seus desafios são tão reais quanto seus, bem, dons são extraordinários. [decisive]
511. [pure] [fraco] Não consigo respirar direito.
512. [pure] A Sarah não, [ofegante], sabe que eu vim aqui pra falar com você sobre o dinheiro.
513. [pure] Os 30 mil, hum, que o pai me deixou em vez da Sarah, bom, eu ia, [culpado], dar pra vocês dois pro bebê mas eu queria, [lutando], te contar primeiro antes dela descobrir que ele, [amargo], me escolheu. [tosse úmida]
514. [pure] [sumindo] Eu sei, é, o quanto vocês dois precisavam, principalmente com as demissões vindo.
515. [pure] [delirante] Quer dizer, a Sarah sempre disse que eu era o preferido, hum, mesmo quando éramos crianças, e acho que, [vazio], o pai provou que ela tava certa no final deixando tudo pra mim enquanto ela ficou com, [voz sumindo], nada além da caminhonete velha dele. [ofegante]
516. [pure] [divagando] Lembra quando, hum, a gente foi pescar naquele verão antes de você casar com ela, e, bom, você pegou aquele robalo enorme e a Sarah, [sorriso fraco], caiu no lago tentando pegar ele com a rede?
517. [pure] [divagando] Ela parecia tão, ah, feliz naquele dia, antes de tudo ficar complicado com, bom, o pai ficando doente e o testamento e eu, [arrependido], sendo covarde demais pra contar pra ela sobre o dinheiro enquanto ele ainda tava, [pesado], vivo quando talvez a gente pudesse ter, hum, resolvido isso.
518. [pure] [chorando] Mas eu machuquei ela guardando segredos e agora ela vai, [angustiado], descobrir quando eu tô sangrando num armazém e ela vai pensar que eu vim aqui pra, [desesperado], te contar pelas costas dela em vez de só ser, [quebrado], corajoso o bastante pra encarar ela.
519. [pure] [fraco] Me promete que se, bom, alguma coisa acontecer, você vai contar pra ela que eu tava vindo pra, hum, acertar as coisas, que o dinheiro sempre foi, [urgente], pra vocês dois e pro bebê, não uma, [enfraquecendo], última jogada idiota de poder do pai. [respiração curta]
520. [pure] [sussurrado] Os paramédicos chegaram e, hum, tá ficando tudo bem, [tranquilo], claro e quieto agora, tipo aquela manhã no lago antes dos, [distante], peixes começarem a morder e a gente só ficou boiando lá, ah, sentindo que tudo ia ficar, [sereno], bem pra sempre. [expira devagar]
521. [en] [surprised] You look, um, really familiar like I've, [searching], seen you somewhere before but I mean, not recently.
522. [en] The kid with the, [stunned], thick glasses and braces who always ate, [remembering], lunch alone in the library because everyone called you, [regretful], names and threw things at your head. [long pause]
523. [en] [ashamed] I remember.
524. [en] [heavy] Well, I, um, ended up here working in corrections after, [guilty], my own stint on the other side of these, [quieter], bars for assault charges when I was, [trailing off], nineteen.
525. [en] [honest] Yeah, well, turns out being popular in high school, [reflective], doesn't mean much when you're detoxing in a cell, um, wondering how you became exactly the kind of person you know, your mother warned you about.
526. [en] I know, um, this doesn't mean anything now but I've thought about you, [remorseful], every single day since I got clean and realized how much, [voice breaking], pain I must have caused you back then. [sighs deeply]
527. [en] [earnest] If I could go back and protect that, [pained], scared kid in the library from myself and everyone else—
528. [en] [accepting] You became everything we said you'd, [admiring], never be while we became nothing. [sighs]
529. [en] [whispered] You're right. [cries]
530. [en] [grateful] Um, thank you, I mean—
531. [pure] [frio] O veterinário sênior está ocupado, [controlado], e eu sou perfeitamente capaz de examinar seu, [amargo], precioso investimento sem precisar entender seu, [cortante], valor monetário pro senhor. [suspira]
532. [pure] [tenso] Sim pai, sou eu, [defensivo], o filho que jogou fora o diploma de direito pra, [sarcástico], desperdiçar a vida brincando com animais como você disse tão eloquentemente, [cansado], há 3 anos atrás.
533. [pure] [magoado] Obviamente, porque Deus me livre você ter que, [zangado], encarar a decepção de um filho que escolheu curar em vez de, [amargo], litigância corporativa.
534. [pure] Hum, os marcadores de inflamação estão, bom, nas alturas e, [clínico], sem tratamento imediato, você vai ter, [sério], claudicação permanente ou pior, e tipo, [mais suave], não tô dizendo isso pra te machucar. [pausa]
535. [pure] Bom, quer dizer, é meu trabalho ajudar todo animal que, [profissional], passa por essas portas independente de, hum, quem traz eles.
536. [pure] [aquecendo] Pai, hum, você me ensinou a nunca desistir de algo que eu, [emocionado], amava, mesmo que, bom, você quisesse dizer direito corporativo e não, [mais leve], medicina veterinária. [risinho]
537. [pure] [gentil] O Trovão precisa de cirurgia nas próximas 12 horas e eu sou, [firme], o técnico assistente, o que significa que você vai ter que, [significativo], confiar em mim.
538. [pure] [surpreso] Você sabia que eu estava aqui e mesmo assim, [tocado], veio mesmo que, bom, a gente não se fala desde aquela briga terrível sobre a oferta de sociedade.
539. [pure] Meu Deus, eu não reconheci ele porque ele, [choroso], emagreceu tanto, mas hum, claro que vou fazer tudo, é, pra salvar ele, pai. [chorando baixinho]
540. [pure] Eu gostaria disso, e hum, talvez você pudesse finalmente ver que essa, [orgulhoso], escolha de carreira não foi sobre rejeitar você mas, bom, sobre me encontrar. [suspira]
541. [en] [gentle] These aren't just, um, old movie things, they're, [reverent], pieces from the Golden Age studios that, well, collectors have been searching for, [awed], for decades, I mean, this is extraordinary.
542. [en] [careful] Your mother's name wouldn't happen to be, [hopeful], Eleanor Westbrook, would it, because that's the anonymous donor who's been, [excited], preserving cinema history for forty years.
543. [en] [soft] Sometimes the most unassuming people are the, [knowing], greatest guardians of history, and your mother saved pieces that studios were literally, [passionate], throwing in dumpsters during the seventies.
544. [en] I've been searching for, um, the Casablanca airport beacon for, [emotional], fifteen years to complete our memorial exhibit, and it's right here.
545. [en] [tender] That's exactly what she saved.
546. [en] The museum would be honored to, [respectful], display her collection with full attribution, finally giving her the, [earnest], recognition she deserves.
547. [en] Every piece here tells a story and your, [warm], mother made sure those stories wouldn't be forgotten, which is the most noble thing, [admiring], any collector can do.
548. [en] [supportive] Well, now you can, um, use those marketing skills to, [encouraging], tell her story the way it deserves to be told.
549. [en] [moved] That's exactly what she would have wanted, not fame for herself but, [thoughtful], preservation of the art she loved so deeply.
550. [en] [reassuring] We'll do this together, piece by piece, and um, every single item will be treated with the, [reverent], respect your mother showed when she saved them, because well, [emotional], this is her life's work and her gift to the world. [voice breaking]
551. [pure] [observador] Olha, é... em trinta anos cuidando de bar, eu vi esse, [sabendo], olhar específico umas três vezes só—o olhar de alguém que, [gentil], descobriu algo que não vai deixar dormir, sabe, algo que reescreve a, [cuidadoso], história que achava que conhecia.
552. [pure] A maioria das pessoas que sentam onde você tá, [curioso], sentado tá fugindo de alguma coisa, mas você, bom, você parece que tá correndo em direção a algo que não tá, [perceptivo], pronto pra alcançar ainda, sabe o que eu quero dizer? [ri baixinho]
553. [pure] Ruínas tão antigas e tão fundas significariam que nosso, [fascinado], entendimento inteiro da história humana precisa ser reescrito do zero. [assobia baixo]
554. [pure] Parece que você encontrou algo que faz você, [pensativo], questionar se somos tão avançados quanto gostamos de, [filosófico], pensar que somos, né, quer dizer deve ser, bom, aterrorizante e emocionante ao mesmo tempo. [suspira]
555. [pure] [pausado] Sabe, é... minha avó costumava dizer que, [sábio], cada geração acha que é a primeira a descobrir o fogo, mas, bom, talvez a gente só tá, [reflexivo], redescobrindo o que foi perdido, sabe, encontrando nosso caminho de volta pra algo, [místico], esquecido em vez de ir pra frente pra algo novo.
556. [pure] Hum, pesado, né.
557. [pure] [gentil] Olha, eu não sei muito sobre, é, arqueologia submarina ou civilizações antigas, mas eu conheço esse, [apoiando], olhar nos seus olhos—você tá carregando algo que é grande demais pra uma pessoa, [compreensivo], aguentar sozinha, e bom, é por isso que você tá aqui falando com um estranho em vez de, sabe, celebrando com colegas. [pausa]
558. [pure] [inspirador] O negócio com descobertas que mudam o mundo é que elas não, [encorajador], mudam o mundo de uma vez—elas mudam uma pessoa primeiro, depois, [crescendo], se espalham como ondas de uma pedra jogada em água parada até que eventualmente toda a, [profundo], superfície fica diferente. [sorri]
559. [pure] Talvez essa seja a verdadeira descoberta—não as ruínas em si mas o, [pensativo], lembrete de que nada que construímos é permanente, que toda grande civilização vira, [poético], sítio arqueológico de outra pessoa eventualmente, e tem algo quase, [tranquilo], reconfortante nessa impermanência.
560. [pure] E hoje à noite você tá sentado no meu bar, [compreensivo], só mais uma pessoa lutando com o peso do conhecimento, tentando fazer as, [compassivo], pazes com uma verdade grande demais pra palavras antes de ter que encontrar as, [gentil], palavras pra compartilhar mesmo assim.
561. [pure] Olha, hum, o que você acha que, [defensivo], sabe sobre meu negócio, é, você entendeu tudo errado e, [nervoso], eu posso explicar tudo se você só, bom, me der uma chance aqui. [suspira]
562. [pure] [derrotado] Bom, quer dizer, tá bom.
563. [pure] Os fabricantes me disseram que eram, [desesperado], legítimos e eu não tinha motivo pra duvidar deles depois de, [voz falhando], 10 anos nesse ramo.
564. [pure] A economia tá difícil e as pessoas precisavam de, [lutando], opções acessíveis então eu achei um fornecedor que podia, [mais baixo], ajudá-las a continuar no esporte.
565. [pure] [quebrado] Olha, hum, eu nunca quis machucar ninguém, quer dizer, eu só tava tentando, [engasgando], sobreviver aqui como todo mundo, sabe?
566. [pure] [em pânico] Espera, por favor não faz isso—eu tenho, [suplicante], 2 filhos pra sustentar e se isso vazar, [voz embargada], vou perder tudo pelo que trabalhei. [soluçando]
567. [pure] [desesperado] Eu posso consertar isso de alguma forma, [frenético], devolvendo o dinheiro de todo mundo e testemunhando que eles não sabiam que os tacos eram, [voz falhando], falsos então talvez eles possam recorrer das desqualificações. [chorando]
568. [pure] Então, hum, o que acontece agora—eu só, é, fico esperando as autoridades, [tremendo], aparecerem na minha porta, quer dizer?
569. [pure] Eu sei, hum, que você me odeia agora mas preciso que você, [desesperado], entenda que eu nunca quis que nada disso, bom, acontecesse.
570. [pure] [derrotado] É, bom, acho que nós dois aprendemos que, hum, integridade é um luxo que alguns de nós, [envergonhado], não podem pagar quando estamos desesperados o bastante pra, é, acreditar nas próprias mentiras sobre, [quebrado], só tentar ajudar as pessoas. [suspira pesadamente]
571. [pure] [frio] O filantropo que quer resgatar nosso teatrinho comunitário é, [riso amargo], a mesma pessoa que não conseguiu resgatar nosso casamento.
572. [pure] [frustrado] Você tá certo, é, tinha motivos sim como você, [acusatório], escolher salvar o mundo em vez de, bom, [voz embargada], escolher salvar a gente quando mais precisava, sabe, [exala], quando mais precisava.
573. [pure] [cético] Você sempre achou que dinheiro podia, [resignado], resolver tudo, até as coisas que nunca foram sobre dinheiro. [suspira]
574. [pure] [suavizando] Esse teatro tem sido minha, [emocionado], vida inteira desde que você foi embora, a única coisa que, [voz embargada], me manteve de pé quando todo o resto desmoronou, [baixinho], desmoronou.
575. [pure] [surpreso] Sério?
576. [pure] [tremendo] Sabe, é... eu fui numa das suas, [envergonhado], festas três anos atrás mas eu, bom, [voz caindo], não consegui me aproximar de você, quer dizer, não depois de tudo.
577. [pure] [chocado] Você me viu naquela noite e você, [magoado], não disse nada, nem sequer, [acusatório], tentou me impedir de ir embora? [pausa longa]
578. [pure] Eu fiquei naquela chuva por, é, [chorando baixinho], vinte minutos esperando você vir atrás de mim, quer dizer, [quebrado], rezando pra você me seguir do jeito que você, bom, costumava fazer.
579. [pure] O teatro precisa desesperadamente desse dinheiro mas aceitar de você parece, [conflitado], abrir uma porta que eu passei cinco anos aprendendo a manter fechada.
580. [pure] [choroso] Você quer saber a, é, [lutando], verdade sobre por que eu realmente trabalho aqui, bom, [desmoronando], é porque a gente teve nosso primeiro encontro nesse teatro, quer dizer, [sussurrado], assistindo aquela produção terrível de Romeu e Julieta. [chora baixinho]
581. [mix] [defensive] O protocolo da universidade exige que eu publique minhas descobertas através de, [careful], revisão por pares antes de liberar qualquer coisa pra, [dismissive], advogados que podem interpretar mal evidência arqueológica.
582. [mix] [quiet] É, bom, eu não sabia.
583. [mix] [stunned] Na verdade, é, é mais que isso porque, bom, os depósitos minerais mostram que, [growing interest], nothing larger than a rabbit has been buried there since the 1960s. [pause]
584. [mix] [conflicted] Quer dizer, é, eu tô tão focado na significância histórica que eu, bom, não considerei o, [guilty], custo humano dos meus atrasos.
585. [mix] [resolved] Sabe, é, eu tenho o relatório completo com, [determined], todos os pontos de dados e evidência fotográfica que poderia, bom, provar que a linha do tempo da promotoria é, [confident], fisicamente impossível.
586. [mix] Bom, quer dizer, quando você coloca assim, é, as implicações éticas ficam, [ashamed], crystal clear and I realize I've been prioritizing my career over, [regretful], a liberdade real de alguém e, [breaking], a família dele. [sighs heavily]
587. [mix] [determined] É, eu vou fazer mais que testemunhar porque, sabe, I'll provide every piece of evidence, every, [passionate], fotografia e medição que prova que essa condenação foi baseada em alegações impossíveis.
588. [mix] [committed] Bom, é, eu entendo agora que meu trabalho não é só sobre, [reflective], descobrir o passado mas sobre corrigir injustiças presentes. [determined pause]
589. [mix] [firm] Me diga exatamente o que você precisa de mim pra, [focused], consertar isso.
590. [mix] [resolute] Bom, é, você vai ter tudo isso porque, sabe, a verdade enterrada naquele solo é mais, [passionate], importante que qualquer reconhecimento acadêmico que eu possa perder por ajudar, [determined], você. [exhales]
591. [mix] [awkward] Ah, é, desculpa, não sabia que alguém estaria aqui hoje—your sister hired me, é, [nervous], pra avaliar tudo antes do leilão da semana que vem. [clears throat]
592. [mix] [uncomfortable] Olha, é, eu vejo que isso é, [uncomfortable], uma situação difícil e não quero ficar, é, [hesitant], no meio de problemas de família aqui. [sighs]
593. [mix] [gentle] Olha, eu entendo como deve ser difícil ver um estranho, [sympathetic], mexendo nessas memórias preciosas, especially when you weren't, [careful], expecting it. [pauses]
594. [mix] [resigned] Mais frequentemente do que eu gostaria de admitir, though that doesn't make it, [sad], any easier to witness cada vez que, [weary], acontece.
595. [mix] [curious] Ela devia ser especial pra você—quer dizer, é, pelo jeito que as coisas dela estão arrumadas aqui, [observant], everything tells a story, né?
596. [mix] [tentative] É, escuta, eu ainda não comecei o inventário oficial, então, bem, [tentative], maybe we could go through things together first? [gently]
597. [mix] [thoughtful] Às vezes preservar as histórias por trás dessas peças importa mais que, [sincere], seguir o contrato ao pé da letra, and clearly, [warm], your grandmother understood that. [softly]
598. [mix] [understanding] Bem, é, itens podem misteriosamente sumir dos inventários, é, [conspiratorial], especially small sentimental pieces que talvez tenham sido, [gentle], perdidas antes do avaliador chegar. [whispers]
599. [mix] [kind] É, bem, eu restauro coisas quebradas pra viver, então eu reconheço quando algo só precisa, [kind], de um pouco de cuidado em vez de ser substituído, sabe? [smiles sadly]
600. [mix] [warm] Eu adoraria isso—and you can tell me the stories enquanto, [encouraging], a gente trabalha.
601. [en] [confused] What's this? I don't—wait, is this addressed to me? Um, I haven't gotten actual mail in, like, forever. [pause] "Dear Sarah, you probably don't remember me but..." [slowly] Oh my God, this is handwritten. Nobody does that anymore, right? [curious] "...when you held the elevator for me last Tuesday and asked if I was okay..." Wait, I—[gasp softly] I remember her. She was, you know, crying in the corner and I just... I mean, I didn't really do anything special. [warm] "You stayed with me for twenty minutes..." Did I? Honestly, I was just—er, it seemed like she needed someone. [shaky voice] "I had just lost my job that morning and was going to..." [pause] Oh. Oh no. [whispering] "...but your kindness reminded me that strangers can care." [sniffle] I had no idea she was—I mean, the thing is, I was literally just killing time before my meeting. [crying while speaking] "You saved me that day." I—[long pause] How do you not know? Like, how do you go through life not knowing you actually... [relieved] She's okay now. Says she got a better job and—[laugh] she named her rescue cat after me. [very sincerely] I just held a door. That's all I did.
602. [pure] [amargo] Sabe o que é engraçado? Aquela coisa toda, é... a reputação que basicamente destruiu minha carreira—o negócio é que, [sarcástico] todo mundo estava tão preocupado com meu "problema de imagem." [pausa] Não conseguia emprego em lugar nenhum, né? Tipo, vinte anos de experiência não significavam nada porque eu era o denunciante que, [frustrado], não sabia jogar o jogo.

Mas esses moleques? [warm] Eles realmente me escutam por causa disso. Quer dizer, ontem essa menina, ela tem uns 16 anos, basicamente me disse, [animated] "Você é o único adulto que entende—você realmente lutou contra o sistema." [chuckle] E eu fiquei ali pensando, pô, caramba.

[hesitantly] É estranho como a coisa que me deixou, hum... inempregável no mundo corporativo é literalmente—[passionate] é exatamente o motivo pelo qual eles confiam em mim. Eles veem alguém que, sabe, não só seguiu as regras. [empathetically] Alguém que foi derrubado e, honestamente, ficou no chão por um tempo.

[very sincerely] Quando eu falo pra eles sobre consequências, sobre fazer escolhas, eles sabem que eu não sou só, [trailing off]... algum adulto fazendo sermão. [excited] Eu já passei por isso, mais ou menos. Circunstâncias diferentes mas, [confidently] a mesma sensação do mundo inteiro contra você. [sigh] E talvez essa reputação, sei lá... talvez ela tenha me levado exatamente onde eu precisava estar.
603. [mix] [anxious] Tá, então, é... eu recebi a ligação ontem e simplesmente—cara, não consigo parar de pensar nisso. Tipo, isso é literalmente tudo que eu trabalhei pra conseguir, sabe? O emprego perfeito, a cidade que eu queria, tudo isso. [pause] Mas o negócio é o seguinte, é... minha mãe tá piorando e eu não sei se consigo simplesmente... ir embora.

[frustrated] Porra, por que o timing tem que ser assim? Quer dizer, 5 anos atrás eu teria pulado nessa oportunidade sem nem—[sigh] Mas agora? Meu pai não consegue cuidar dela sozinho, he's basically falling apart already. E minha irmã, bem, ela mora do outro lado do país então não é como se ela pudesse realmente ajudar.

[sad] Sabe o que me mata? Minha mãe na verdade ia querer que eu fosse. Ela ficaria furiosa se soubesse que eu tô considerando ficar por causa dela. [laugh] Ela literalmente me disse semana passada—quando ela tava tendo um dia bom—ela falou "nem ouse colocar sua vida em espera por minha causa."

[shaky voice] Mas como é que eu simplesmente... vou embora? Quer dizer, what if something happens and I'm not here? [very quietly] E se eu perder os últimos dias bons? [pause] É, acho que eu já sei o que vou fazer. [resigned] I think I've known since the moment they called.
604. [pure] [exausto] Gente, eu simplesmente... nem consigo— [riso] a gente conseguiu, cara. Tipo, 23 anos que essa empresa tá funcionando e, hum, a gente nunca—nem uma vez—terminou antes da véspera de Natal. [empolgado] E hoje é só dia 20! [pausa breve] Quer dizer, sinceramente, quando a matriz disse que tínhamos 40 mil pedidos a mais que ano passado, eu pensei, bom, já era, né? A gente tá ferrado. [risadinha] Mas aí vocês todos simplesmente, [calorosamente], vocês se superaram de um jeito que eu— [voz sumindo]

[very sincerely] Eu tô fazendo isso há, o quê, 8 anos? E todo dezembro é tipo—sabe—caos total até literalmente o último segundo possível. [relieved] Mas olha pra gente! O armazém tá, é, vazio mesmo. [laugh loudly] Vazio! Quando que isso já aconteceu em dezembro? [delighted] Os filhos da Sarah vão, quer dizer, eles vão conseguir jantar com ela hoje. E Tom, [smiling speaking] você não disse que não conseguia ir na apresentação de Natal da sua filha há, hum, 3 anos?

[emotional] Eu fico andando por aí esperando ver, sei lá, tipo, mais um palete de pedidos em algum lugar, mas não tem— [gasp softly] não tem nada. A gente terminou. [extremely happy] A gente terminou mesmo, e, hmm, eu acho que eu vou— [cry] desculpa, é que eu tô muito— [laugh hard] a gente conseguiu!
605. [mix] [excited] Caraca, tá acontecendo mesmo—Atlantic Records quer assinar com a gente! Tipo, um contrato de verdade, não é qualquer gravadora indie que ninguém conhece. [laugh] Eu fico relendo o email toda hora porque, tipo, não consigo acreditar que isso é real. [anxious] Mas o negócio é o seguinte—eles querem a gente em turnê em 2 meses, which means I'd have to quit at the firm. Largar tudo mesmo. Tipo, [slowly], sair de 6 anos de estabilidade, plano de saúde, meu 401k...

[sigh] Meu pai vai surtar quando eu contar que tô deixando um emprego de 70 mil pra tocar em barzinho pelo país. E sinceramente? [hesitantly] E se a gente for só mais uma banda que eles largam depois de um álbum? E se eu—what if this is the biggest mistake of my life?

[pause]

Mas aí eu penso em ficar sentado naquele cubículo por mais 20 anos, sabe, watching other people live their dreams on Spotify enquanto eu fico arquivando relatório trimestral. [passionately] A gente tá tocando "Bohemian Rhapsody" em casamento faz 5 anos, and now we get to write our own songs, nossa própria música de verdade!

[confidently] Eu tenho 31 anos. Se não for agora, quando? [very quietly] Acho que eu tenho que fazer isso. [smile speaking] Não—I know I have to do this.
606. [mix] [confused] Eu nunca pensei—quer dizer, quem abre uma loja de furar bola de boliche esperando, sabe, ISSO? [chuckle] Era pra ser só eu, umas furadeiras, e talvez, uh, um cliente ocasional que precisasse ajustar os buracos dos dedos. [warm] Mas agora é tipo—honestly, I walk in every morning and já tem gente aqui. [pause] Metade das vezes nem são clientes.

[animated] O Joe traz donuts toda terça, né? E, um, a Martha fica tricotando naquela cadeira do canto enquanto a bola dela é polida—[laugh] ela nem joga mais boliche! [slowly] O negócio é que, em algum momento, isso simplesmente... virou outra coisa. [happy] Os moleques fazem lição de casa no balcão depois da escola, e eu tô lá, ajudando com álgebra entre um serviço e outro. [short pause] Eu! Álgebra!

[very sincerely] Semana passada, quando a mulher do Tommy deixou ele, ele ficou sentado aqui por, sei lá, 3 horas? [empathetically] A gente nem falou sobre boliche. Just... life, you know? [sigh] E foi aí que me caiu a ficha—[speeding up] this isn't really about bowling balls anymore, is it? [extremely happy] É essa, er, bagunça linda de pessoas que de alguma forma se encontraram no lugar mais estranho. [laugh loudly] Uma loja de bola de boliche! [trailing off] Quem diria...
607. [en] [bored] So, um, just another Thursday doing my route, you know, same houses, same meters, same—wait. [curious] That's... hmm, that's not right. The thing is, I've been reading meters for, like, eight years now and I've never seen—[gasp] oh my God. Oh my God, that's literally sparking. [anxious] There's actual, I mean, there's exposed wiring just hanging from the meter box and it's—it's right next to the gas line. [very quickly] This is bad, this is really really bad, someone could, er, someone could die from this. [pause] Okay, okay, I need to, ah, I need to call this in right now. [loudly] Hey! Ma'am! Don't come any closer! [shaky voice] There's a, um, there's a serious electrical hazard here, just—just stay back please. Actually, you know what, everyone needs to get away from this area. [stern] I'm calling emergency services right now, this is, honestly, this is the worst thing I've seen. The homeowner had no idea, she was just, like, going about her day while this—[frustrated] how long has this been like this? [relieved] Thank God I noticed it, I mean, I almost walked right past it but something just, sort of, caught my eye. [anxious] They're sending someone immediately, but Jesus, this could have been catastrophic.
608. [mix] [gasp loudly] Pera, você tá—você tá falando sério? O Tommy entrou no MIT? [very excited] With a FULL scholarship? Ai meu Deus, eu só—[pause] Desculpa, preciso de um segundo aqui, é tipo... [crying while speaking] Lembra quando ele nem conseguia olhar nos meus olhos? Aquele moleque que, hm, usava a mesma camiseta da NASA três dias por semana, and basically lived in the robotics lab? [laugh] E agora ele—[very sincerely] Quer dizer, eu sempre soube que ele era brilhante, né? Mas sinceramente, vendo ele lutar pra, tipo, só conversar com as pessoas... [sniffle] O negócio é que eu nem tinha certeza se ele ia se inscrever. [warm] Ele ficava dizendo que MIT era pra "gênios de verdade," e eu ficava lá tipo, [animated] "Tommy, você literalmente construiu um robô funcional que joga xadrez!" [chuckle] Meu Deus, os rascunhos da redação dele—ah, a gente passou por quantas, 17 versões? [extremely happy] E ele tava tão preocupado com aquela entrevista, kept practicing his answers in the mirror, e eu só... [trailing off] Não consigo acreditar que aquele moleque tímido e brilhante realmente... [pause] [passionately] Isso é tudo pelo que ele trabalhou. Tudo. [whispering] Tô tão orgulhoso que eu podia explodir.
609. [en] [gasp softly] They actually did it. They're rolling out my system to all two hundred and thirty stores. [pause] I mean, I knew the regional manager liked it when she visited last month, but [very excited] the entire chain! [laugh] 

God, remember when Tony made fun of me for color-coding the collection zones? [mocking] "Why are you trying so hard for minimum wage?" [bitter] Well, who's laughing now? [short pause] District manager, that's who I am now. District. Manager. [slowly] I keep saying it because, um, it doesn't feel real yet.

[warm] My mom cried when I told her. [sniffle] She was like, "Mija, you turned pushing carts into a promotion." [chuckle] And honestly, that's exactly what happened. 

[quickly] The efficiency went up forty-seven percent at our store—forty-seven! [animated] Less customer complaints, faster turnaround, employees actually liked the system because it was, you know, actually logical. [proud] They're calling it the Martinez Method in the training manual. 

[very quietly] Sometimes I still can't believe it. [pause] Four years of collecting carts in the Arizona heat, and I actually [speeding up] figured out something nobody else thought to fix. [extremely happy] District manager. Me. [belly laugh] Tony can kiss my promoted ass.
610. [mix] God, I can't believe I'm even thinking this, mas tipo... [confused] o jeito que ela olhou pro meu relógio ontem? When I mentioned the promotion, o rosto dela inteiro simplesmente— [pause] acendeu diferente. Não por mim. Pelo número. [bitter] And honestly, tô repassando cada conversa agora, sabe? Cada uma delas. [anxious] That time she asked about my investment portfolio on our third date—achei que ela tava, er, interessada na minha vida. [sarcastic] Right. Porque todo mundo discute hedge funds durante a entrada.

[hurt] The thing is, eu realmente—quer dizer, tô me apaixonando por ela. [very quietly] Like, really falling. Caindo de verdade. Forte. And now I'm sitting here wondering se cada risada foi real, se aquele beijo significou alguma coisa, se— [angry] Jesus, será que eu sou tão ingênuo assim? [frustrated] Her friends literally call me "the catch," não pelo meu nome. The catch. [laugh bitterly] Como se eu fosse um peixe fodido com etiqueta de preço.

[shaky voice] I keep hoping I'm wrong, que talvez eu tô só, hmm, sendo paranoico? But then she texted asking about vacation homes e— [sigh] a gente tá saindo há 6 semanas. [very sad] Six weeks and I thought this was real. [whispering] Eu realmente achei que era real.
611. [mix] [very quietly] I just... I finally get it. Depois de todos esses anos, é, eu finalmente entendo por que ser rejeitado da faculdade de medicina foi—[gasp softly] meu Deus. Não foi um fracasso de jeito nenhum, né?

[bitter] I spent, like, three years hating myself for that. Absolutamente convencido de que eu tinha, sabe, arruinado tudo. Meus pais ficaram tão [pause] decepcionados. E honestamente, cara, eu achei que minha vida tinha acabado. [sniffle] Achei mesmo.

But here's the thing—if I'd gotten in, eu nunca teria aceitado aquele emprego aleatório de professor. Nunca teria descoberto que eu podia, é, realmente conectar com aquelas crianças que todo mundo tinha [slowly] desistido. Aqueles que me lembravam de... bem, [very melancholic] de mim, eu acho.

[warm] And now? Agora eu tenho ex-alunos que são, tipo, médicos eles mesmos. Engenheiros. Artistas. Eles me escrevem e dizem—[crying while speaking] eles dizem que eu salvei eles. Mas a coisa é, eles me salvaram também, sabe?

[laughing] God, I can't believe I'm actually grateful for failing. Tipo, genuinamente [passionate] agradecido. Aquela carta de rejeição que eu, é, literalmente queimei no meu quintal? [chuckle] Não tava fechando uma porta. Era... sei lá, tava me libertando pra me tornar quem eu realmente deveria ser. [very sincerely] Graças a Deus eu falhei. Graças a Deus.
612. [pure] [voz trêmula] Eu fico pensando no que poderia ter acontecido se eu não tivesse— [pausa] Os Silva, eles têm mais de oitenta anos, sabe? [ansioso] Eu tava só fazendo minha leitura de rotina do medidor, nada demais, mas os números estavam, hum, estavam completamente fora. [confuso] Tipo, absurdamente altos pra uma casa daquele tamanho, e eu pensei talvez— [devagar] pera, isso não tá certo. [suspiro suave] Então eu bati na porta deles, e a Dona Silva, ela tá lá com o andador dela, [preocupado] me dizendo que eles estavam sentindo tontura há dias. [acelerando] Eles achavam que era só o calor, mas eu sabia, eu sabia que tinha algo errado com aquelas leituras. [severo] Eu falei pra eles saírem imediatamente, só— [urgentemente] "Saiam agora, tô chamando a companhia de gás." [pausa longa] No fim das contas tinha um, é... vazamento enorme no porão deles. [bem baixinho] O técnico disse que mais um ou dois dias e... [voz sumindo] [aliviado] Mas a gente pegou a tempo, graças a Deus pegamos a tempo. [empaticamente] O Seu Silva, ele pegou na minha mão depois com os olhos cheios de lágrimas, e eu simplesmente— [chorando ao falar] eles poderiam ter morrido. [caloroso] Tudo porque eu realmente prestei atenção naqueles números em vez de só, sabe, anotar e seguir em frente. [muito sinceramente] Às vezes seu trabalho importa mais do que você imagina.
613. [mix] [warm] Sabe o que é engraçado? Na verdade, eu, hm, devo tudo à Professora Chen me dizendo que minha escrita era—como ela falou mesmo—"painfully amateur." Meu Deus, quer dizer, eu lembro de estar sentado lá no escritório dela, tentando não [crying while speaking] desmoronar completamente enquanto ela basicamente destruía meu manuscrito inteiro. Tipo, every single page had these brutal notes, sabe? E sinceramente, eu fui pra casa naquela noite pensando que talvez eu devesse—sei lá, desistir dessa coisa de escrever de vez.

[pause]

Mas aí, é, aconteceu uma coisa estranha. Eu ficava ouvindo a voz dela, né? "Your characters don't breathe, they just exist." E eu pensei—espera, [excited] what if she's actually giving me the roadmap? Tipo, cada comentário duro estava essencialmente me dizendo exatamente o que consertar! Então eu comecei a reescrever, e digo realmente reescrever, não só, é, fazer ajustes aqui e ali.

[passionately] 3 anos depois, quando eu consegui aquele contrato de publicação, a primeira pessoa que eu mandei email foi ela. E ela respondeu dizendo que sempre soube que eu tinha potencial, she just—[chuckle] ela precisava me dar um empurrão. Sinceramente? [very sincerely] Aquela sessão devastadora de feedback foi a melhor coisa que aconteceu pra minha carreira.
614. [en] [confused] I just—I literally cannot believe what just happened in there. Um, did they seriously just give the promotion to Derek? [bitter] Derek who's been here, what, six months? [pause] I mean, I've been doing solar sales for three years—THREE years—and they pick the guy who still asks me how to, like, calculate panel efficiency? [angry] It's just so—honestly, the thing is, I trained him! [frustrated] I actually sat there and taught him everything about, you know, residential installations, commercial systems, er, all of it. 

[sarcastic] But sure, yeah, give it to Derek because he's, what—[mocking] "bringing fresh energy to the team"? [sigh] That's basically what they said, right? Fresh energy. [sad] I guess my energy is just... old? [shaky voice] Here's the thing, I've closed more deals than anyone else in this department. Actually, no—[enunciating every word] more than everyone else combined some months. [quietly] And it's like none of that even matters because Derek played golf with the regional manager twice and suddenly he's—[trailing off]

[very sad] I don't know, maybe I should've seen this coming. [sniffle] It's fine. It's totally fine. I'll just, um, keep doing what I've been doing and, ah, pretend like this doesn't completely... [long pause] [whispering] God, this really hurts.
615. [pure] [extremamente feliz] Não acredito que a gente conseguiu mesmo! [pausa] Os números chegaram hoje de manhã e, é... a gente é oficialmente número um em toda a região Sul. [empolgado] Seis meses atrás eu tava literalmente [frustrado] implorando pras pessoas só me ouvirem sobre energia solar, sabe? [risadinha] E aí eu pensei—pera, e se eu parar de vender e começar a, [hesitante] sei lá, realmente ajudar? [caloroso] Aquela primeira oficina comunitária na biblioteca, [riso nervoso] só apareceram 12 pessoas. Mas essas 12 pessoas, [apaixonadamente] elas contaram pros vizinhos sobre como a gente calculou a economia real deles, não um papo corporativo. [pigarreando] A gente começou a fazer noites de educação energética, parceria com comércios locais, e de repente [maravilhado] as pessoas tavam ligando pra gente! [riso alto] Meu gerente ficou tipo, "O que você tá fazendo aí?" [confiantemente] Construindo confiança, é isso. [suspiro] Cara, quando a Dona Maria trouxe o grupo de leitura inteiro dela pra nossa oficina, [falando sorrindo] e todas se inscreveram? [suspiro suave] Foi aí que eu soube que essa abordagem era diferente. [orgulhosamente] A gente não tá só no topo de vendas—[empaticamente] a gente mudou mesmo como essa comunidade pensa sobre energia. [muito sinceramente] Isso é maior que qualquer cheque de comissão, sabe? [pausa] Bom, tá, a comissão também é bem legal. [gargalhada]
616. [pure] Pera, isso não pode tá certo. [confuso] Quer dizer, eu tô literalmente olhando pra tela mas—pera aí, deixa eu atualizar a página. [nervoso] Tá, então continua aqui, hum, o Marcus Henderson realmente escreveu que meu trabalho é—como é que ele fala—"luminoso e necessário." [riso] Luminoso! O mesmo cara que, é, basicamente chamou meu último trabalho de lixo derivativo agora tá usando a palavra luminoso? [amargo] Cinco anos, sabe? Cinco anos dele, tipo, sistematicamente destruindo tudo que eu já—[pausa] Sei lá, talvez alguém hackeou a conta dele ou algo assim. [desconfiado] Mas pera, ele menciona cenas específicas, aquele negócio dos espelhos, e sinceramente ninguém mais nem percebeu aquela parte. [hesitante] Então ele realmente... assistiu? Assistiu de verdade dessa vez? [suspiro suave] Ai meu Deus, acho que eu vou—[voz trêmula] Todas aquelas noites que eu fiquei acordado me perguntando se eu tava, tipo assim, me enganando sobre ter algum talento, e agora—[fungar] É tão idiota mas eu meio que quero imprimir isso. [riso alto] Emoldurar talvez? Isso é patético? [caloroso] Minha mãe vai pirar quando eu contar pra ela. Sabe de uma coisa? [confiantemente] Eu mereci isso. Cada palavra dessa resenha, porra, eu mereci.
617. [pure] [confuso] Pera, isso não pode ser— tô olhando o manual e... [pausa] meu Deus do céu. A vírgula decimal. [sussurrando] Eu tenho colocado a vírgula no lugar errado. [ofegando alto] Por oito anos. Oito. Porra de. Anos. [voz trêmula] Você entende o que isso significa? Cada leitura que eu fiz, hum, cada família da minha rota— [bem baixinho] eles têm pagado dez vezes mais do que deveriam.

[anxious] A Dona Maria com os três filhos dela, ela— [stuttering] e-ela me falou mês passado que não tinha dinheiro pra comprar comida. [upset] E os Silva, eles perderam a excursão do filho porque não conseguiram pagar. Eu achava que eles eram só, tipo, ruins com dinheiro mas— [long pause]

[angry] Como é que ninguém percebeu isso? Na verdade, como é que eu não— [trailing off] Quer dizer, o treinamento foi tão rápido e... [regretful] Não, isso não é desculpa. [cry] Centenas de famílias. Algumas provavelmente perderam suas casas. [whispering loudly] E se alguém não conseguiu comprar remédio?

[hesitantly] Eu tenho que contar pro meu supervisor mas, ah, isso é— [very meekly] eles vão me mandar embora. [bitter] Oito anos de presença perfeita não vale nada quando você basicamente tá roubando as pessoas. [sigh] Meu Deus, meu estômago tá— [mumbling] acho que vou passar mal.
618. [pure] [confuso] Pera, então, hum, deixa eu ver se entendi direito—a Sarah basicamente reestruturou nosso sistema financeiro inteiro? [curioso] E é por isso que teve aquela reunião estranha ontem onde, tipo, ninguém sabia o que tava acontecendo? [pausa breve] Quer dizer, eu achei que a gente ia ser demitido ou algo assim, sério. [riso nervoso] Do jeito que todo mundo tava cochichando pelos corredores, sabe?

[gasp softly] Mas aí—meu Deus, [speeding up] ela realmente achou todo esse dinheiro que tava, sei lá, preso nesses contratos antigos e acordos com fornecedores? [excited] E em vez de, é, guardar pra bônus de executivo ou sei lá o quê, [very excited] eles vão dar pra gente? Pra todo mundo? [laugh loudly]

[disbelief] Eu literalmente não consigo—tipo, quando que isso acontece? [warm] A Sarah podia ter, sabe, só se mostrado bem pro conselho, mas ela realmente... [trailing off] [sniffle] Desculpa, é que—foi um ano tão difícil, né? Com a inflação e tudo mais? [happy] E agora a gente vai receber bônus de verdade? [extremely happy] Não aquelas festinhas ridículas com pizza, mas dinheiro mesmo?

[gratefully] Eu finalmente posso, hum, consertar meu carro! [laugh] E talvez até, tipo—[gasp] pera, isso dá pra aquela viagem que eu cancelei? [cheerful] Meu Deus, a Sarah é literalmente—ela é basicamente um gênio. [very sincerely] Eu retiro tudo que eu disse sobre o pessoal de finanças ser sem alma. [chuckle] Bom, a maioria deles, pelo menos.
619. [en] [shocked] I got the call twenty minutes after they arrested Richard. Twenty minutes! I mean, I'm literally sitting in my car outside headquarters right now and there's still news vans everywhere. [pause] They offered me the CFO position—my absolute dream job at Kellerman Industries—while my predecessor is probably, um, getting fingerprinted or something. 

[excited] God, I've wanted this role for five years! Five years of interviews, networking events, basically stalking their quarterly reports. [hesitantly] But this is not—this is not how I imagined it happening, you know? 

I keep thinking about all those spreadsheets I'll inherit. [anxious] What if there's more? Like, what if I walk in there tomorrow and discover he cooked the books so badly that we're actually bankrupt? [nervous laugh] HR said something about "restoring trust" and I just nodded like an idiot because, honestly, what do you even say to that?

[bitter] The worst part? Everyone's going to look at me like I'm either the savior or, er, the next criminal waiting to happen. [determined] But I worked too damn hard for this. [pause] I'll fix whatever mess he left, implement every control he clearly ignored, and... [trailing off] 

[quietly] I just wish my first day wasn't going to be on every business blog tomorrow. [sigh] "New CFO starts amid embezzlement scandal." Great headline, right?
620. [en] [exhausted] God, I just... I keep replaying it in my head, you know? [short pause] Twenty million customer records, er, that's what we saved. Twenty million. [bitter] And all it cost me was, well, basically my best friend since college. [sigh] 

I mean, the thing is, when I saw those logs—[anxious] Jesus, when I realized it was Marcus's credentials being used for the breach attempt, I actually thought someone had, like, hijacked his account or something. [frustrated] But no, no it was him. It was actually him selling access to, um, to some ransomware group for what? [shouting] Fifty grand? [regretful] Fifteen years of friendship for fifty thousand dollars.

[very sad] He just sat there when I confronted him, wouldn't even—[trailing off] ... [long pause] The worst part is, honestly, I get it. His kid's medical bills, the divorce, I mean—[angry] No, actually, screw that. [confidently] I did my job. Protected the company, protected those customers. [whispering] But God, the look on his face when security escorted him out... [very melancholic] 

I keep thinking maybe there was another way, but—[hesitantly] there wasn't, right? There really wasn't. [crying while speaking] I had to report it, had to fire him, had to, um, had to do everything by the book because that's—[sniffle] that's what the job demands.

[cough]
757. [en] [exhausted] Um, so, will you help me?

760. [pure] [hesitante] Tão, é, terminei de imprimir os programas do memorial há, bom, [solene], uma hora atrás mas não tinha certeza se você, ah, [devagar], realmente viria buscar hoje à noite.
761. [pure] [caloroso] A foto que você mandou saiu bem nítida e o, [pausa], layout do texto ficou digno e profissional como você pediu.
762. [pure] [bem baixinho] Sinto muito.
763. [pure] Escuta, quer dizer, eu já imprimi milhares desses programas de memorial ao longo dos anos e, hum, [empaticamente], a culpa sempre parece mais pesada pras pessoas que, bom, [gentilmente], realmente fizeram tudo certo.
764. [pure] [sussurrando] Eu na verdade, é, conhecia ela do bairro e ela sempre falava sobre como, bom, [orgulhosamente], tinha orgulho de trabalhar na sua equipe projetando cruzamentos mais seguros e, ah, [tremendo], protegendo trabalhadores de obra como ela mesma. [pigarreando]
765. [pure] Às vezes a tinta nesses programas de memorial parece, [pesado], mais pesada do que qualquer outra coisa que eu imprimo o ano todo.
766. [pure] [formal] Bom, quer dizer, cada um representa uma vida que importou pra alguém e, hum, [respeitosamente], eu tento honrar isso garantindo que a impressão fique, tipo, [cuidadosamente], perfeita mesmo que minhas mãos tremam enquanto, ah, [nervosamente], coloco o papel.
767. [pure] [severo] Talvez eles precisem ouvir isso porque, [apaixonado], luto sem ação só cria mais luto e se suas palavras, [acelerando], prevenirem que mais uma família tenha que planejar um funeral então a morte dela significa algo além da perda.
768. [pure] [amigável] Sabe, é, eu fiquei até tarde especificamente porque imaginei que você ia precisar de alguém pra, bom, [compreensivo], conversar quando viesse buscar esses programas e não só, ah, [gentilmente], mais uma transação numa loja vazia.
769. [pure] [muito sinceramente] Às vezes estranhos são exatamente quem a gente precisa porque eles conseguem, [honestamente], ver nossa dor sem o peso de, [profundamente], ter que nos consertar ou melhorar as coisas. [pausa longa]
770. [mix] [bitter] Então, você tá morrendo?
771. [mix] [confused] Sabe, por 15 anos eu imaginei esse momento, [angry], me perguntei qual explicação possível você teria pra, [trembling], destruir minha infância e agora você tá aqui, [frustrated], morrendo na minha frente. [pause]
772. [mix] [shocked] Isso é impossível porque meu pai era um, [hesitantly], empresário respeitado que me amava mais que tudo.
773. [mix] Então você decidiu, [coldly], me sequestrar ao invés disso? [long pause]
774. [mix] [quietly] Mas você roubou minha infância ao invés disso, minha família, [anxious], minha vida inteira virou sobre sobreviver ao que você fez comigo.
775. [mix] [upset] Me salvar? Você me isolou de todos que eu amava, [furious], me fez acreditar que o mundo inteiro era perigoso, e agora você quer, [very sad], o quê exatamente dessa confissão? [cough]
776. [mix] [laughing bitterly] Sabe o que é engraçado é que eu me tornei um promotor especializado em, [stern], casos de sequestro por sua causa, dediquei minha vida inteira pra entender monstros como eu achava que você era.
777. [mix] [suspicious] Você tem me observado todos esses anos, [horrified], keeping track of my life like some twisted guardian angel who still thinks they saved me?
778. [mix] [thoughtful] Bem, se o que você tá dizendo é verdade então eu preciso dessas gravações, [determined], I need proof because, meu pai morreu 3 anos depois que eu desapareci. [groan]
779. [mix] Eu não sei se posso te perdoar mas, [conflicted], maybe I can finally understand why my nightmares were never just about you, quer dizer, [very melancholic], eles eram sobre ser vendido. [deep sigh]
780. [mix] [tactful] Quando soube que você tava coordenando o evento deste ano, achei que era, [slowly], hora da gente se cruzar profissionalmente.
781. [mix] Você precisava encontrar seu próprio caminho sem, [empathetically], se sentir devendo nada pra ninguém, and clearly you've succeeded beyond what either of us imagined.
782. [mix] [gently] Eu vi você crescer de, bem, aquele estagiário de eventos quebrado que não podia comprar sapatos decentes pra, é, someone who's organizing the most prestigious trade show in the industry, então sim, eu tenho, sabe, assistido com orgulho.
783. [mix] [matter-of-factly] A dinâmica mudou agora, né—você é quem tem, [chuckle], o poder de decidir onde vai meu estande e se eu consigo, [playfully], prime placement on the show floor.
784. [mix] Lembra quando você desenhava projetos de estande em guardanapos naquela cafeteria, [nostalgic], sonhando em organizar eventos assim um dia?
785. [mix] Eu vi seu talento antes, [thoughtfully], de você mesmo enxergar, reconheci aquela fome de criar algo significativo, [trailing off], e eu simplesmente te dei espaço pra descobrir isso sem, [long pause], desespero financeiro nublando sua visão.
786. [mix] [tenderly] Ver você ter sucesso já foi agradecimento suficiente, e, bem, agora eu posso ser só mais um expositor que, é, admira seu trabalho em vez de, sabe, [clearing throat], alguém que complicou sua jornada com, [wistfully], dívidas emocionais desnecessárias.
787. [mix] É exatamente por isso que eu sabia que você tinha crescido pro, [respectfully], profissional que eu sempre acreditei que você poderia ser. [sigh]
788. [mix] [hopeful] Eu gostaria muito disso—talvez a gente possa finalmente, é, conversar como iguais em vez de, [carefully], o que éramos antes, e talvez, sabe, [vulnerably], eu possa explicar por que ir embora foi o presente mais difícil, [voice breaking], que eu já te dei.
789. [mix] [delighted] Olha pra gente sendo todo maduro e, bem, profissional sobre isso, though I have to admit, é, [whispering], ver você comandando toda essa operação me deixa, [passionately], mais orgulhoso do que qualquer sucesso empresarial que eu já tive, [gasp softly], e olha que isso é dizer muito.
790. [pure] [amargo] É, bom, hum, eu não exatamente, [voz trêmula], planejei precisar de resgate do meu irmão mais velho que, tipo, [baixinho], abandonou a família pra ir brincar com barcos.
791. [pure] [defensivo] Só conserta o motor.
792. [pure] [ansioso] Olha, quer dizer, hum, desculpa mas te ver aqui, [tremendo], traz tudo de volta de quando você foi embora e, bom, [arrependido], o pai ainda nem fala seu nome. [tosse]
793. [pure] [muito timidamente] A vela era pra, [hesitante], me ajudar a clarear as ideias depois de largar medicina porque, [chorando ao falar], eu não aguentava mais a pressão.
794. [pure] [exausto] O pai queria outro médico na família já que você, [amargamente], se recusou a ser um.
795. [pure] Sabe, hum, eu costumava te odiar por, bom, [ciumento], ter conseguido sair enquanto eu ficava preso sendo o, quer dizer, [monótono], filho perfeito que eles precisavam depois que você foi embora.
796. [pure] [esperançoso] O barco na verdade era meu jeito de, [nervosamente], entender por que você escolheu essa vida ao invés da gente, e estando aqui, [apaixonadamente], tô começando a ver como é a sensação de liberdade. [riso]
797. [pure] Talvez depois que você consertar esse motor, [pensativo], você poderia me ensinar a velejar direito porque, [timidamente], eu quero entender esse mundo que te salvou de, [devagar], se afogar nas expectativas deles.
798. [pure] [brincalhão] Só promete que você não vai deixar eu, [brincando], afundar esse barco de novo porque a mãe definitivamente vai te culpar.
799. [pure] [feliz] Sabe, hum, talvez perder meu motor tenha, tipo, [gratamente], valido a pena pra ter meu irmão de volta, mesmo que, bom, [bem baixinho], tenha sido preciso quase me afogar pra te encontrar de novo.
