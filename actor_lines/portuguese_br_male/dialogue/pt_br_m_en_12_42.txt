Character 1 [en]: So, um, I've been [upset] looking at this synthesis pathway, you know, and actually, I don't think the Grignard reagent is going to work here.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, you're absolutely right to question that! The presence of that acidic hydrogen on the hydroxyl group would definitely kill the Grignard before it could react with the carbonyl.

Character 1 [en]: Right, er, that's what I mean, basically, we need to protect that alcohol first.

Character 2 [en]: Well, we could use a silyl protecting group, sort of, like TBS or TIPS, uhh, which would be stable under the basic conditions. Plus they're easy to remove later with just some fluoride source, you know what I mean?

Character 1 [en]: TBS might be overkill though, don't you think?

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, you have a point there, the thing is, like, for this particular substrate, even a simple acetyl group would probably do the trick. It's cheaper too, and we can cleave it with mild base after the Grignard addition.

Character 1 [en]: Ah, but honestly, wouldn't the acetyl group be kind of susceptible to nucleophilic attack itself?

Character 2 [en]: True, true, but remember the Grignard preferentially attacks the aldehyde over the ester - it's way more electrophilic. The kinetics really favor the aldehyde addition, especially if we keep things cold.

Character 1 [en]: What temperature are we talking?

Character 2 [en]: So, I'd start at negative seventy-eight, anyway, then warm slowly to negative forty, I guess, just to maintain selectivity. We did something similar last month with that benzaldehyde derivative, remember? Got like ninety-two percent yield with minimal side products.

Character 1 [en]: Uh, that's really conservative though, it's just that we might not need to go that cold.

Character 2 [en]: Ha! You're probably [laugh hard] right, I'm being overly cautious again! But hey, better safe than dealing with a mess of byproducts, especially when the starting material costs what it does.

Character 1 [en]: Right so, err, what about using zinc instead, probably less reactive but more selective?

Character 2 [en]: Okay so, organozinc reagents, you see, they're definitely gentler, actually, but the transmetallation can be tricky. You'd need to make the zinc reagent from the Grignard first, or use Rieke zinc, which is a whole other headache with handling and storage.

Character 1 [en]: Umm, here's the thing, [very loudly] I already ordered the zinc dust, well, so we might as well try it!

Character 2 [en]: Oh wow, you already— [clearing throat] okay then, that changes things! We'll need to activate that zinc properly though, maybe with some iodine or TMSCl to get a clean surface for the reaction to proceed.

Character 1 [en]: I was thinking 1,2-dibromoethane for activation.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, that's [excited] perfect, like, dibromoethane is my go-to activator, you know! It gives you that nice color change when the zinc's ready, plus the ethylene just bubbles off harmlessly, no messy byproducts to deal with.

Character 1 [en]: Hmmm, how much catalyst do we need, basically, for this scale, I think?

Character 2 [en]: For a fifty millimole scale, anyway, I'd use about five mole percent, honestly, though you could probably get away with less, sort of, if your zinc is fresh. The key is adding it slowly while monitoring the temperature - you'll see that characteristic fizzing when it's working.
