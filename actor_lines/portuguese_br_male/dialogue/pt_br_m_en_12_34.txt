Character 1 [en]: So our CEO keeps pushing this whole digital transformation thing. I just need to know—what's actually useful versus what's just buzzword nonsense?

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] Oh man, yeah, I totally get where you're coming from! The buzzword fatigue is, like, so real—but honestly there's some genuinely transformative stuff buried under all the, uh, marketing speak if you know where to look.

Character 1 [en]: Okay but we already have a website and email. What else do we really need?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, it's not just about having digital tools, it's more about, hmm, fundamentally rethinking how work gets done? Like, are your teams still manually entering data between systems, or—or waiting days for approvals that could happen in minutes?

Character 1 [en]: We do have a lot of manual data entry, actually. It's a nightmare.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Ooh, see that's exactly the kind of thing that, er, automation could completely eliminate! Have you guys looked into RPA at all—robotic process automation—where basically software bots handle all that tedious copy-paste stuff between systems?

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] R-robotic what now? That sounds expensive.

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] No no, it's actually way more affordable than you'd think! We're talking maybe, uhh, twenty grand to get started, and then you're saving hundreds of hours of manual work every month—the ROI is usually, like, three to six months tops.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Wait, robots? Like actual robots?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, no sorry, that's—that's confusing terminology, I know. It's just software that mimics human actions on a computer, you know? Clicks buttons, copies data, fills out forms—basically anything repetitive that your employees probably hate doing anyway.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm. What about our customer service? That's been a pain point.

Character 2 [en]: Oh geez, customer service transformation is, mmm, huge right now. You could implement chatbots for basic queries—and I'm not talking about those terrible ones from five years ago—these new AI ones actually understand context and can, er, handle like eighty percent of common issues.

Character 1 [en]: [laugh histerically] Please don't tell me we need to become a tech company!

Character 2 [en]: Ha, no definitely not! The whole point is using existing platforms that, uhh, other companies have already built and tested—you just plug them into your existing processes and gradually modernize without having to, like, rebuild everything from scratch.

Character 1 [en]: How long does this transformation stuff usually take?

Character 2 [en]: [happy] Well honestly, if you start small and practical—which it sounds like you want to do—you can see real improvements in, mmm, maybe three months? The key is picking one painful process, fixing that, then moving to the next one instead of trying to, you know, boil the ocean.

Character 1 [en]: And what usually goes wrong? Give me the real answer.

Character 2 [en]: Oof, okay so the biggest failure I see is, uh, companies buying fancy tech without training anyone properly, right? The tools sit there unused while everyone just... keeps doing things the old way because nobody actually explained why the change matters to them personally.

Character 1 [en]: So basically it's more about people than technology?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly, yeah—the technology part is actually pretty straightforward these days. It's the change management, the training, the, er, getting buy-in from skeptical employees... that's where things get tricky, but if you handle that well, the actual transformation part kind of takes care of itself.
