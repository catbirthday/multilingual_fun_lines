=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Um, I don't mean to, [stunned], stare but you look exactly like, well, someone I used to, [trembling], know a long time ago, uh, before everything changed. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: That's a weird thing to, [uncomfortable], say to someone just trying to buy, [defensive], organic chicken at a farmer's market on a Saturday, [cold], morning.

Character 1 [en]: No, I mean, it's just that you have, [searching], the same eyes as my daughter who I, um, haven't seen since, [broken], the divorce papers were signed eighteen years ago.

Character 2 [en]: Your daughter would be, [calculating], nineteen now which happens to be exactly how old I am, [realizing], but that's probably just a coincidence. [nervous laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Her mother changed her last name to, [careful], Mitchell after she remarried and moved to this exact town, [hollow], which is why I started selling here.

Character 2 [en]: [frozen] My last name is Mitchell and my mom, [shaking], always gets weird when I ask about my biological father who she says, [bitter], worked in food processing before he, [trailing off], abandoned us.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] I never abandoned anyone, I just, [pained], lost the custody battle.

Character 2 [en]: [sharp] That's not what she told me for, [angry], eighteen years of birthdays you never showed up for, [accusatory], or graduation ceremonies you missed.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Well, I sent cards, um, every single year but they always came back, [defeated], marked return to sender, I mean, I tried.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] Um, she said you never even, [confused], tried to contact us, like, not once after you left.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] I have boxes of returned letters in my truck right now if you, [earnest], want to see them.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I don't, um, understand why she would, [lost], lie about something like that for, well, my entire life. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Maybe she thought she was protecting you from, [sad], disappointment or maybe she was protecting herself from, [understanding], having to share you.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Well, um, protecting me from what exactly, I mean, from knowing my father actually, [cracking], gave a damn about me?

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] I'm sorry.

Character 2 [en]: Sorry doesn't give me back, [angry], eighteen years of thinking I wasn't worth fighting for when apparently you were, [breaking], fighting the whole time just to, [sobbing], send me a birthday card.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] I know it doesn't change anything but I've been, [emotional], setting up at this market every weekend for three years hoping, [voice cracking], you might walk by. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Three years of Saturdays just standing here with your, [disbelief], organic chickens waiting for me?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Three years of Saturdays watching every teenager walk by hoping to see, [tearful], my daughter's face.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I need to, [overwhelmed], go process this somewhere that isn't in front of a poultry stand but maybe, [tentative], maybe we could talk again next, [hopeful], Saturday.
