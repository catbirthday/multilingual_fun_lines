=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [defensively] My mom and stepdad aren't home right now, but they said someone would be coming by for the annual inspection, so I guess you can come in.

Character 2 [en]: [professionally] I appreciate that, and I'll need to check all the units throughout the house, including bedrooms and the basement if you have one. Should take about forty-five minutes.

Character 1 [en]: The basement's locked actually, and Mark doesn't like anyone going down there without him being present, so maybe you could skip that part today?

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] I'm afraid that's not how this works—state fire code requires inspection of all areas, especially basements where electrical panels and heating systems are typically located.

Character 1 [en]: [nervously] Look, I'm seventeen, I don't have the key, and Mark will literally lose his mind if I let someone down there while he's gone.

Character 2 [en]: You mentioned Mark, that's your stepfather? [pauses] I'm noticing some unusual burn patterns on this hallway ceiling that weren't in last year's report.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] Those are from a candle accident a few months ago, my mom already filed the insurance claim and everything, totally documented and legitimate.

Character 2 [en]: Candle accidents don't typically create pour patterns like these—see how the damage radiates outward in multiple directions? That suggests an accelerant was used.

Character 1 [en]: [voice dropping] You don't understand what you're getting into here, and I really think you should just mark everything as passing and leave before they get back.

Character 2 [en]: [concerned] Son, I've been doing this for twenty years, and what I'm seeing here, combined with your reaction, tells me something serious happened in this house. Are you safe here?

Character 1 [en]: [barely audible] Please just go.

Character 2 [en]: I can't leave without completing the inspection, but more importantly, these burn patterns, the way you're protecting that basement, [exhales], I'm legally required to report suspected arson to the fire marshal.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] It wasn't arson, it was self-defense, okay? Mark had Mom cornered in the kitchen and I grabbed the lighter fluid from the grill and just, I wanted to scare him.

Character 2 [en]: You're telling me you used lighter fluid to protect your mother from your stepfather, and now you're alone in this house waiting for them to return?

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] They made me promise never to tell anyone, said foster care would be worse, that we're a family and families handle things internally no matter what happens.

Character 2 [en]: Listen to me very carefully—what you're describing is not normal family behavior, it's abuse, and you defending your mother doesn't make you the problem here.

Character 1 [en]: You think I don't know that? But she chose him over getting us out, and now I'm stuck playing this game where we all pretend everything's fine. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I'm going to call this in, but not as arson—as a welfare check requiring immediate response, which means police and social services will be here within the hour.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Mark keeps a gun in that basement he's not supposed to have because of his record, so maybe mention that when you call it in.

Character 2 [en]: [pulling out phone] I'm staying right here with you until help arrives, and we're going to wait outside by my truck where it's visible and safe, okay?
