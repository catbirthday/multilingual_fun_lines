Scenario: A die cutter operator accidentally injures his hand during a factory tour being filmed for the company's new safety campaign by the communications director.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [dazed] Well, um, I've been running this machine for, uh, fifteen years and never once had the blade slip, [disbelieving], like that during a demonstration, I mean, especially not with cameras rolling.

Character 2 [en]: [panicked] Um, there's so much blood.

Character 1 [en]: [calm] The funny thing is I can't even, [detached], feel it yet which probably means the nerves are still in shock.

Character 2 [en]: Listen, um, I need you to keep that hand elevated while I, [frantic], try to remember where they keep the first aid kit because, well, my whole crew just ran off to find help and I'm, [scattered], completely lost in this factory layout, you know?

Character 1 [en]: You know, it's actually kind of ironic that we were filming the, [weak laugh], safety video when this happened, um, maybe you can use this as a what-not-to-do segment, right?

Character 2 [en]: [soothing] Just keep talking to me while I wrap this, [focused], tourniquet around your wrist to slow the bleeding down.

Character 1 [en]: [rambling] I mean, my wife's gonna be so mad because, um, I promised her I'd be extra careful today since, well, she's been worried about these old machines and, uh, here I am proving her right.

Character 2 [en]: Your color's getting better now that we've got pressure on it, [relieved], though we definitely need to get you to medical within the next few minutes.

Character 1 [en]: [woozy] You know you're pretty good at this for someone who probably spends most of their time, [appreciative], behind a desk writing press releases and, [trailing off], organizing photo shoots.

Character 2 [en]: [confession] Well, I was actually an EMT for, um, three years before I got into corporate communications, so, uh, blood doesn't really bother me the way it, [gentle], used to when I first started.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] That explains why you didn't just, [impressed], faint like that new intern did last month when Jimmy got his finger caught in the, [chuckling], hydraulic press.

Character 2 [en]: [steady] The bleeding's almost stopped now which is, [encouraging], a really good sign that we didn't hit anything major.

Character 1 [en]: Um, I keep thinking about how this is gonna look on the incident report, you know, 'veteran operator injures himself while showing off for, [embarrassed], corporate video crew' and, well, I'll never hear the end of it.

Character 2 [en]: [reassuring] Nobody needs to know you were demonstrating an advanced technique when the, [careful], safety guard malfunctioned because technically the camera wasn't even, [conspiratorial], recording at that moment.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You'd really edit that part out of the, [hopeful], footage for me even though it would probably make great training material?

Character 2 [en]: Look, accidents happen even to the most, [understanding], experienced people and making you look bad won't help anyone, [firm], learn anything useful. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [weary] Well, um, I guess we should probably head to the medical station now before I, uh, start feeling whatever pain is definitely coming once this, [nervous], adrenaline wears off, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [supportive] Um, yeah, let's go.

Character 1 [en]: Thanks for not completely freaking out on me because most people would've just, [sincere], run away at the first sight of blood.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Hey, we're all just trying to look out for each other here, [thoughtful], and besides, this'll make one hell of a story at the next, [lighter], company meeting.
