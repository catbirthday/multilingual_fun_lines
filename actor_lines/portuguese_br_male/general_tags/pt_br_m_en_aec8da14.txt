Scenario: The favorite child of a prominent family confronts an eccentric street artist who has been painting unflattering murals of their parents' corporation on buildings throughout the city.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [diplomatic] Look, um, I know you're the one who's been, [careful], painting those murals about my family's company, and well, I just wanted to, [nervous], talk to you about maybe, er, finding some common ground here.

Character 2 [en]: [guarded] The golden child finally descends from the tower to speak with, [bitter], the rabble who dare criticize the empire.

Character 1 [en]: [conciliatory] I understand why you're angry, I mean, really I do, and um, [sincere], there are things about my family's business that even I, [uncomfortable], question sometimes, but these murals are, well, [trailing off], they're causing real problems. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Oh, um, problems for who exactly—your father's PR team or, uh, [sarcastic], the communities your factories have been poisoning for decades?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] I'm not here to defend them, okay, I mean, um, I actually, [hesitant], agree with some of what you're saying, er, even if I can't say that publicly.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Then leave.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] But maybe if we worked together, [thoughtful], found a way to create change from within instead of just, [weary], tearing everything down from the outside. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [withdrawing] You think wearing designer clothes to a protest makes you, [scoffing], some kind of ally or revolutionary?

Character 1 [en]: I never claimed to be revolutionary, but I'm here, [vulnerable], trying to bridge this gap even though my family would, [quiet], disown me if they knew.

Character 2 [en]: [distant] Well, um, maybe that's a risk you should, er, [dismissive], actually take instead of just, you know, talking about it. [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] I've already started documenting the environmental violations from inside, [whispered], gathering evidence that could actually, [determined], make a legal case instead of just, [frustrated], painting accusations on walls. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, you're actually collecting evidence against your own, [disbelief], family's company while still living under their roof and, [conflicted], taking their money? [silence]

Character 1 [en]: [resolute] It's the only access I have to those documents, [steady], and yes, it makes me a hypocrite, but at least I'm, [raw], trying to do something real.

Character 2 [en]: [softening] That's either the bravest or the most, [uncertain], naive thing I've heard from someone in your position, and honestly I'm not, [contemplative], sure which one it is yet.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] So, um, will you at least, well, consider working with me on this instead of, er, [tired], against each other?

Character 2 [en]: [reluctant] Give me one good reason why I should trust someone who's, [skeptical], literally been groomed since birth to protect the very system I'm fighting.

Character 1 [en]: Because, um, being the favorite child means, [pained], they never see me as a threat, you know?  [whispers]

Character 2 [en]: [considering] Fine, um, I'll think about it, but if this is some kind of, [wary], elaborate trap or if you're just, well, [firm], trying to save face for daddy's company, then, er, these murals will be the least of your worries. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, fair enough.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Meet me tomorrow at the warehouse on Fifth Street, and um, [measured], bring those documents you mentioned because I'll know if they're, [sharp], real or if you're just another privileged kid, well, [tired], playing at rebellion.
