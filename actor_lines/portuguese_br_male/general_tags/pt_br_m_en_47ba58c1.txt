=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] Um, I wasn't expecting, well...

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You look, um, really familiar like I've, [searching], seen you somewhere before but I mean, not recently.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Franklin High School.

Character 2 [en]: The kid with the, [stunned], thick glasses and braces who always ate, [remembering], lunch alone in the library because everyone called you, [regretful], names and threw things at your head. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: That was me twenty years ago before the, [bitter], surgeries and therapy sessions and learning how to, [measured], pretend I belonged in rooms where people, [hollow], actually looked at me without laughing.

Character 2 [en]: [ashamed] I remember.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] You were one of the worst ones who'd, [angry], follow me home throwing rocks and calling me, [breaking], hideous while your friends recorded it on their, [choked], phones for everyone to watch later.

Character 2 [en]: [heavy] Well, I, um, ended up here working in corrections after, [guilty], my own stint on the other side of these, [quieter], bars for assault charges when I was, [trailing off], nineteen.

Character 1 [en]: [disbelieving] The golden boy quarterback who had, [sarcastic], everything handed to him on a silver platter went, [stunned], to prison and now works as a, [processing], guard? [laughs darkly]

Character 2 [en]: [honest] Yeah, well, turns out being popular in high school, [reflective], doesn't mean much when you're detoxing in a cell, um, wondering how you became exactly the kind of person you know, your mother warned you about.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] My brother's the one I'm here visiting today after, [careful], three years of him being inside.

Character 2 [en]: I know, um, this doesn't mean anything now but I've thought about you, [remorseful], every single day since I got clean and realized how much, [voice breaking], pain I must have caused you back then. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Well, you're right that it doesn't erase anything but I mean, seeing you here in this uniform instead of, [contemplative], on some pedestal makes me realize we both, [quieter], ended up somewhere different than anyone, um, expected.

Character 2 [en]: [earnest] If I could go back and protect that, [pained], scared kid in the library from myself and everyone else—

Character 1 [en]: [interrupting] But you can't, and I mean, that scared kid had to save herself which, well, made me stronger than, [proud], any of you ever were. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] You became everything we said you'd, [admiring], never be while we became nothing. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [resolute] I, um, spent years in therapy learning that your cruelty was never actually, [understanding], about me but about whatever darkness lived inside, well, you.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] You're right. [cries]

Character 1 [en]: [unexpected warmth] Maybe we both needed to break completely before we, [philosophical], could rebuild into people who actually understand what, [gentle], real strength looks like instead of just, [thoughtful], pretending.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Um, thank you, I mean—
