=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [territorial] This is my place, been living here for, [aggressive], three years without anybody bothering me and now you just burst in here bleeding everywhere.

Character 2 [en]: Please, I just need, um, [desperate], somewhere to hide for a few hours, I mean, they're going to kill me if they find me out there.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] What kind of trouble are you in that has you, um, [wary], running into abandoned buildings at midnight, I mean, [quieter], looking like death already caught up with you? [scoffs]

Character 2 [en]: [shaking] I testified against some, uh, [terrified], very dangerous people who don't believe in, well, [voice cracking], second chances or witness protection that actually, um, [bitter], protects anyone.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] Damn. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Look, I know what it's like to lose, [broken], everything you've built, your safe space, your, [trailing off], sense of security in this world.

Character 1 [en]: [harsh] You don't know anything about losing everything until you've, [angry], watched your family walk away because the nightmares from Afghanistan made you too, [voice breaking], dangerous to be around your own, [whispered], children.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] I had to, um, [pained], send my daughter away three states over because they, well, [trembling], threatened to do things to her that I can't even say out loud. [choking up]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] Jesus, that's why you're bleeding, [understanding], they already found you once tonight and you barely, [impressed], got away alive but you're still, [admiring], standing here fighting.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Still standing, [hollow], barely. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: There's a hidden spot behind the boiler room that even the, [conspiratorial], cops don't know about when they do their sweeps, and it's, [helpful], warmer down there too. [softer]

Character 2 [en]: Why would you help me after I just, [confused], invaded your home and brought danger to the only, [grateful], place you felt safe? [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: Because I remember what it's like to have, [melancholic], people hunting you, even if mine were just, [darkly amused], memories and ghosts instead of real bullets, and nobody, [firm], deserves to face that alone.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] In my old life I walked past people like you, [ashamed], every single day without even making eye contact, [regretful], thinking I was somehow better or more deserving of, [breaking], basic human dignity.

Character 1 [en]: [wise] The streets teach you that we're all just, [philosophical], one bad day away from switching places with anyone, [matter-of-fact], else out here.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] If I survive this, I won't, [promising], forget what you did tonight. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Survival's all any of us can focus on right, [weary], now, but maybe when your hunters are gone you can, [hopeful], help me find my way back to my kids somehow, [vulnerable], show them their dad's still worth knowing. [trails off]

Character 2 [en]: [firm] I was a family lawyer before all this, um, [determined], went to hell, and I swear if we both, well, [emotional], make it through tonight, I'll help you fight to, uh, [passionate], see them again.

Character 1 [en]: [touched] Come on, let's get you hidden before they, um, [urgent], start checking buildings, because I mean, [protective], I've already lost too much to let death win another round, well, [fierce], not in my house. [determined]

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Thank you for, uh, [tearful], seeing me as human when I'm at my, um, [vulnerable], most inhuman moment.
