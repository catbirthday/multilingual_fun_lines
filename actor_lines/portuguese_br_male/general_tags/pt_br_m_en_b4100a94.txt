Scenario: A pipe fitter boards a cargo vessel for emergency repairs, only to discover it's been hijacked by modern pirates who need the ship operational to escape authorities.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Listen, I was told this was just a, [nervous], routine ballast pump repair on a cargo vessel, not whatever, [alarmed], this situation is with all these armed men watching me, [swallowing], work on these pipes.

Character 2 [en]: [calm] Well, um, the thing is we need this ship, [desperate], operational in the next three hours or, I mean, we're all going to have a very bad day.

Character 1 [en]: [shaking] So, uh, you're telling me that I'm basically, [hollow], trapped here fixing pipes for, well, actual pirates who've hijacked this vessel? [laughs nervously]

Character 2 [en]: [genuine] Look, nobody's going to hurt you if you just, [steady], do your job and fix what needs fixing—we're not, [weary], monsters despite what you might think. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] I've got, um, a family waiting for me at home who thinks I'm, [breaking], just doing overtime on a commercial job, not being held at, [quieter], gunpoint by people who, well, steal ships for a living.

Character 2 [en]: The authorities cut off our escape route two days, [frustrated], ago and this ship's cooling system is the only thing keeping us from, [deteriorating], being sitting ducks out here in open, [grim], water.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, the main valve's completely corroded through and, [showing], I mean, without proper parts, I'm basically doing surgery with, er, duct tape and prayers here.

Character 2 [en]: [appreciative] You're doing better than our last, [darkly amused], mechanic who jumped overboard rather than help us.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Maybe he had the right idea considering I'm probably, [voice cracking], going to prison just for being here when the Coast Guard shows up. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] If you get us running, I'll personally make sure you're, [earnest], left somewhere safe with a story that keeps you, [protective], out of trouble—you have my word on that.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] The word of a pirate means about as much as these, [showing], rusted fittings I'm trying to seal with nothing but industrial, [defeated], adhesive and whatever scrap metal I can find. [groans]

Character 2 [en]: [honest] Look, um, I wasn't always doing this—I mean, I used to be an engineer myself before the company, [broken], laid off half of us and well, desperate times. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You were an engineer and now you're, [disbelieving], stealing ships instead of fixing them?

Character 2 [en]: Not stealing—surviving.

Character 1 [en]: The pressure's building up in the auxiliary line and, um, I mean, if this patch doesn't hold, we're looking at, [worried], catastrophic failure in maybe twenty minutes, not, [frantic], three hours like you want.

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] Then we need to reroute through the secondary system while you, [desperate], reinforce the main line because if this ship stops moving, [grave], every single person on board is going to, well, pay for it. [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] God help me.

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] You're a good man doing an impossible, [genuine], job under terrible circumstances and that counts for something.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Just promise me that when this is over, you'll find, [pleading], another line of work that doesn't involve kidnapping pipe fitters.

Character 2 [en]: After tonight, I'm thinking, um, maybe I'll go back to engineering—well, if they'll have someone with my, [regretful], recent work history.
