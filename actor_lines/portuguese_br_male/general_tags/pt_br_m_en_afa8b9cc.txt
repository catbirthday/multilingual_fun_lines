=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [focused] So I need this cardiac arrest scene to feel, [intense], authentic because the entire third act hinges on whether the audience, [measured], believes this character could actually survive.

Character 2 [en]: [professional] Well, um, the survival rates you're describing would require, [thoughtful], very specific circumstances, I mean, the kind of precise medical intervention that rarely happens outside major trauma centers.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Your voice sounds incredibly, [recognition dawning], familiar—have we worked together before on another production? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Not on a film, but, um, I was actually, [hesitant], the person on the phone who talked your assistant through CPR when you, [quieter], collapsed at that festival in Toronto, you know, five years ago. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Wait, you're the one who, [emotional], stayed on the line for forty minutes and basically, [voice breaking], saved my life when everyone else was, [grateful], panicking?

Character 2 [en]: [modest] I was just, um, doing what I'm trained to do, but, [warm], I have to say, well, I've followed your work ever since and seeing you recover to make, [admiring], such beautiful films has been incredible. [smiles]

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] I tried to find you for, um, years actually, but the emergency services said, [frustrated], you were just listed as, well, anonymous consultant number something, and I never got to properly, [earnest], thank you.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] The thanks isn't necessary because watching you, [sincere], continue creating art is honestly reward enough, though I admit when your office called about, [amused], this consultation, I specifically requested to take it.

Character 1 [en]: [moved] You know, the protagonist in this film who, [deliberate], survives against impossible odds—I've been writing them based on my own experience, [vulnerable], that day in Toronto.

Character 2 [en]: [intrigued] That explains why your script captures the, [appreciative], psychological aftermath so perfectly—most films focus on the dramatic moment but you've written about the, [thoughtful], quiet terror that comes after, the gratitude mixed with survivor's guilt.

Character 1 [en]: [reflective] So, um, here's what I really need to know—in that scene where the character hears, [searching], voices while unconscious, is that actually possible?

Character 2 [en]: [knowing] Absolutely real.

Character 1 [en]: [eager] Because I heard you that day, um, your voice cutting through everything, telling me to, [intense], fight, to stay with you, and, well, that's what I want the audience to, [passionate], feel. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [touched] I remember every word I said to you, um, and honestly, when you started breathing again, I mean, [emotional], it was one of the best moments of my entire career.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Then help me get this, [serious], right—not just the medical facts but the human truth of it.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I can't.

Character 1 [en]: I'm sorry, but, um, what I mean is, [earnest], I can't just consult—I want to be there on set, making sure every detail honors what really happens, you know, in those moments between life and death.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Are you saying you'd, [hopeful], leave your position to work on this film?

Character 1 [en]: [confident] I'm saying that, um, some stories deserve to be told with absolute truth, and, [conviction], this one—our story really—is worth taking that, [decisive], leap for. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] Then let's make something that shows people what, um, real survival looks like—not the Hollywood version but the messy, [authentic], terrifying, beautiful reality of coming back from the edge, you know, the way you actually did. [pause]
