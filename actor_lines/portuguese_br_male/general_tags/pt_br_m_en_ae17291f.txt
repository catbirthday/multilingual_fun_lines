=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] So, um, after all these years of, [bitter laugh], chasing shadows, you finally, [exhales], got me in this little room, and well, [shifts], I suppose you want your moment.

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, I spent so many nights, [harsh], studying your patterns, trying to understand how someone could live like that, er, always running, always lying.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, I mean, the thing is, [voice breaking], people like you wouldn't understand what it's like growing up with nothing, uhh, absolutely nothing. [trails off]

Character 2 [en]: Don't you dare, [angry], try to play that card with me when you've destroyed, [voice rising], so many innocent lives, um, with your schemes.

Character 1 [en]: [leaning forward] Well, detective, here's what you don't, [measured], know—every single mark I ever took was, [intense], someone who could afford to lose it, so, like, maybe think about that. [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] That's your justification, really, I mean, [incredulous], you actually believe that makes it right, [shaking head], that somehow you were, um, what, Robin Hood? [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: The Hendersons lost their retirement because, [cold], of a bank that I exposed, the Walkers got their insurance payout, [softer], because I proved fraud, and Maria's daughter, [voice catching], she got her surgery.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Wait, what are you, [uncertain], talking about—Maria Rodriguez, the nurse from Queens, umm, her daughter needed that transplant?

Character 1 [en]: The hospital administrator was, [disgusted], skimming from the charity fund, so yeah, I mean, I took him for everything, [proud], and that little girl is alive today because, [emotional], someone had to play dirty, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] Um, I didn't know.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] You spent five years hunting someone you never, [sad smile], actually tried to understand. [sighs deeply]

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] All those case files never mentioned the, [troubled], afterwards—what happened to the money after you took it.

Character 1 [en]: [wistful] Because nobody ever asks what happens after the, [gentle], con is over—they just see the crime.

Character 2 [en]: [struggling] So, uhh, all this time you were what, [searching], some kind of vigilante con artist who, well, [conflicted], redistributed wealth?

Character 1 [en]: I never kept more than I, [honest], needed to survive, and um, every penny beyond that went to people, [passionate], who actually deserved a second chance, you know? [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [soft] The Martinez family, umm, they got an anonymous donation that saved their home—that was, [realizing], you, wasn't it?

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Their landlord was the same man who, [angry], laundered money through that charity, the one who, [quieter], let kids go hungry while he bought yachts, so yes, [firm], I made it right.

Character 2 [en]: [torn] This doesn't change the fact that what you did was, [uncertain], illegal—I still have to bring you in.

Character 1 [en]: [accepting] I know you do, detective, but maybe, [hopeful], now you understand why I never ran from you, why I, [meaningful], let you catch me, and why, [resolute], I'm not sorry.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] Damn it, I wish, um, [frustrated], I wish you had just been the villain I thought you were because, well, [breaking], this makes everything so much harder. [long pause]
