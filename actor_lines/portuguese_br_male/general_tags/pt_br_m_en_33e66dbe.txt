=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] I haven't been to this estate in, [voice cracking], twenty years but that scar on your hand from the, [trembling], broken wine bottle—it's you, isn't it, [barely audible], Sofia?

Character 2 [en]: [breathless] Michael? Um, I mean, is that really—well, after all this time standing here in, [disbelief], work clothes covered in soot like we're kids playing in the, uhh, old manor again. [laughs shakily]

Character 1 [en]: God, Sofia.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] You disappeared after the, [breaking], fire—your whole family just vanished and I, umm, spent years wondering if you were even, [choking up], alive, and well, here you are cleaning my chimney like, uhh, some cosmic joke.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] We had to leave after dad was blamed for the vineyard burning even though we both, [careful], knew it wasn't his fault.

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] I tried to tell them you were with me that, [desperate], night, that your father couldn't have started it, but nobody would, [frustrated], listen to a twelve-year-old girl.

Character 1 [en]: [heavy] Well, umm, I became what everyone already thought we were—just, uh, working class people cleaning up after the, [bitter], wealthy, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [intense] You were never just anything to me, [fierce], Michael—you were my entire world before everything fell apart.

Character 1 [en]: I thought about writing, um, so many times but, well, what would I even say after, [hollow], your family lost everything because of that fire, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [rising] We didn't lose everything—grandfather rebuilt the vineyard from, [determined], nothing and left it to me when he passed.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] I heard you became the youngest vineyard manager in the region, and umm, every time I drive past those hills, well, I think about the promises we, [wistful], made as kids.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Remember how we carved our initials in that oak tree by the, [nostalgic], old cellar before everything changed?

Character 1 [en]: [concentrated] The tree survived the fire and grew around, [wondering], our marks—I checked last spring when I cleaned the Hendersons' place, [meaningful], next door.

Character 2 [en]: [building] So you've been, umm, working in this area all along, just, [overwhelmed], miles away from where we used to dream about running this place, [voice breaking], together, and I mean, you never once thought to knock on my door?

Character 1 [en]: [focused] Every single day I thought about it but, um, showing up covered in soot to clean the, [pained], chimneys of the girl who was supposed to be my future felt like, well, admitting defeat.

Character 2 [en]: You're not defeated—you're, [fierce], here, you're alive, and that oak tree isn't the only thing that, [passionate], grew around what we carved into, [trembling], this world.

Character 1 [en]: [thick] Um, Sofia, I—well.

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] Stay for dinner after you finish—we have twenty years to, [warm], catch up on and a bottle of the vintage from the year before everything changed.

Character 1 [en]: [building] I still remember how you said the grapes that year tasted like, [emotional], hope, how we snuck into the cellar and made plans to blend a wine that would, [breaking], tell our story, and now you're actually, [amazed], living it.

Character 2 [en]: [loving] Not living it alone though—I mean, not anymore, because, well, you're standing in my doorway and, umm, maybe that's the ending our story was, [hopeful], always meant to have.
