=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Look, um, I don't know who you are or, [dismissive], how you got backstage, but uh, security needs to escort you out right now, like, immediately.

Character 2 [en]: [furious] That track you just, [shaking], dropped at midnight—the one that made everyone, [voice cracking], lose their minds—that's MY song you stole!

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I have absolutely, [incredulous], no idea what you're talking about because every single track I play is either, [firmly], licensed properly or created in my own studio with my team, [scoffs], period.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] I sent you that demo, [desperate], six months ago through your label's submission portal—'Neon Prophecy,' remember that name? [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] Kid, do you have any idea, [exhausted], how many demos I get sent every single day from wannabe producers who all think they've created, [mocking], the next big thing that'll change the industry, [eye roll], forever?

Character 2 [en]: [heated] This isn't about being a wannabe—I have the, [passionate], original project files, the timestamps, everything that proves you literally, [accusatory], ripped off my work! [slams fist]

Character 1 [en]: [aggressive] You better watch what you're, [threatening], accusing me of because my lawyers absolutely love dealing with delusional fans who think, [dangerous], they can make false claims. [steps closer]

Character 2 [en]: Um, uh, you're scared.

Character 1 [en]: [laughing coldly] Scared of what exactly—some nobody who probably, [contemptuous], made a generic four-on-the-floor beat and thinks they invented house music? [shakes head]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Well, um, I recorded our entire conversation and, [confident], I've got proof that'll destroy your reputation when this goes viral, so, uh, maybe we should talk about proper credit, like, right now.

Character 1 [en]: [suddenly serious] Recording me without consent is illegal in this state, and, [menacing], you just admitted to it in front of witnesses.

Character 2 [en]: [steady] Your manager already knows about this because I sent them, [calculated], the cease and desist letter this morning before your set. [smirks]

Character 1 [en]: [rattled] That's impossible because my team would have, [nervous], told me immediately if there was any legal issue, especially something, [frantic], this serious.

Character 2 [en]: [triumphant] Check your phone—I bet they've been trying to, [knowing], reach you all night while you were too busy playing MY track to, [vindictive], thousands of people who paid to hear original music, not stolen, [disgusted], beats. [crosses arms]

Character 1 [en]: [panicking] Even if there was some similarity, which there, [defensive], isn't, coincidences happen in music all the time because we all use, [desperate], the same software, same samples, same, [trailing off], same everything... [pulls out phone]

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Um, that specific synth progression at two minutes fourteen seconds, well, [precise], that's my girlfriend's voice chopped up and pitched down—er, how exactly is that a coincidence?

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Wait, that vocal chop was from, [stunned], a sample pack I bought—my assistant said it was, [realizing], cleared and original content from the label.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Like, your assistant is my ex-business partner who, um, [revealing], stole my entire hard drive when we split, and I guess, [bitter], he's been selling my work to, well, [harsh], the highest bidder—congratulations on being played.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] This can't be happening—my entire career is, [desperate], built on authenticity and if this gets out, [terrified], everything I've worked for is completely destroyed.

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] Well, um, here's what's going to happen—you're going to, [commanding], publicly credit me as co-producer, pay me what I'm owed, and, uh, [final], we're going to have a very long conversation about your assistant, like, tonight. [extends hand]
