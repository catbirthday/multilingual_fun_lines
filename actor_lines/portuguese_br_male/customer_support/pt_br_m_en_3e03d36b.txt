=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Look, I just need to know what's actually covered here.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, absolutely, yes, so I can definitely, uh, help you understand your coverage and, um, let me just pull up your account here—could you, er, give me your policy number or, uh, the account number starting with POL?

Customer [en]: It's, uh... what's the... POL-4429.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, um, okay so I'm seeing POL-4429-BK7 here and, uh, just to confirm—this is for the, um, the comprehensive package you signed up for in, er, let me see here, September, and I want to make sure I'm, uh, looking at the right coverage details for you.

Customer [en]: Yeah. September. So what's in it?

Customer Support [en]: Right, so, um, with your comprehensive package POL-4429-BK7, you've got, uh, quite a bit included here—there's the, um, basic coverage which is your standard protection, and then, er, you've also got the enhanced benefits addon with code ENH-7734 which gives you, uh, extended coverage for specialist visits.

Customer [en]: Specialists. Okay. What about, um... what's the word... preventative stuff?

Customer Support [en]: Oh yes! Um, so preventative care is, uh, actually one of the best parts of your plan—you get, er, annual checkups, routine screenings, and, um, immunizations all covered at, uh, one hundred percent with no copay under benefit code PRV-5512-A.

Customer [en]: Really? No copay for that...

Customer Support [en]: Um, exactly, yes, no copay at all for preventative services, and, uh, let me just double-check here—yep, confirmed under PRV-5512-A, and, er, that also includes, um, wellness visits and basic lab work when it's, uh, part of your annual screening.

Customer [en]: Huh. They didn't mention... okay what about dental?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, dental is where it gets a bit, er, different—your plan POL-4429-BK7 includes, uh, basic dental coverage but it's, um, limited to preventative dental only, so that's cleanings twice a year under code DNT-0981, but, er, major work would need supplemental coverage.

Customer [en]: Um, so like, cavities would be...?

Customer Support [en]: Right, um, so cavities—those would fall under, uh, what we call basic restorative care, and, er, with your current plan those are covered at, um, sixty percent after you meet your deductible which is, uh, let me see here, DED-1500 shows five hundred dollars.

Customer [en]: Five hundred. That's not... terrible I guess...

Customer Support [en]: Um, yeah, it's actually, er, pretty reasonable compared to—oh! Wait, I'm seeing something here—you, uh, you actually have a credit of two hundred dollars from code CRD-8823-M that can apply toward your deductible, so, um, effectively it's three hundred for you.

Customer [en]: Wait really? How'd that happen?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, looking at the notes here under transaction TXN-994521, it looks like, uh, you had an overpayment from a previous claim that got, er, credited back to your account in October, and, um, it automatically applies to your next deductible amount.

Customer [en]: That's... actually helpful. Thanks for finding that.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, of course! I'm just, uh, really glad I caught that—it's easy to miss but, er, your account summary under SUM-7765-X shows you've got that credit plus, um, actually really solid coverage overall, and, uh, is there anything else about your benefits you'd like me to clarify?
