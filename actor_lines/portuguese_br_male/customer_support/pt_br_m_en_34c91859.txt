Customer [en]: I think there's been some kind of problem with my payment?

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely absolutely let me pull up your account right away and we'll get this sorted out no worries at all just need your account number or phone number associated with the rental

Customer [en]: It's probably under... let me see here... 555-0847

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect got it here account ACC-9847-RC and I can see you had a CleanPro rental scheduled for pickup yesterday but there's there's a flag on the payment let me just check what happened here

Customer [en]: I'm really sorry about this, I mean, if there's a problem...

Customer Support [en]: No no no don't even worry about it these things happen all the time honestly the system shows transaction ID TRX-88462-B was declined but but but that's totally fixable we just need to update your payment method and run it through again super simple

Customer [en]: Are you sure it won't affect my rental history or anything?

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh no not at all your account's in great standing otherwise I can see you've rented from us what six seven times before always returned on time your customer score is CS-94 which is excellent so one little payment hiccup means absolutely nothing

Customer [en]: Okay so that means I can still get the machine today, right?

Customer Support [en]: Yes yes definitely once we get the payment sorted you're all set for pickup at location LOC-227 on Maple Street they've got your CleanPro unit reserved and ready model CPX-5500 the one with the pet hair attachment you requested

Customer [en]: I sort of forgot to transfer money to that account, it's embarrassing...

Customer Support [en]: Happens happens happens more than you'd think actually last week I did the same thing with my phone bill so let me let me just get you set up here do you want to use a different card or should I retry the one on file ending in 4429

Customer [en]: Different card, probably safer that way

Customer Support [en]: Smart smart okay ready when you are and I'll stay on while we process it real-time so we know right away if it goes through the authorization code will be AUTH-KM9847 and then you're good to go

Customer [en]: The new one ends in 8823, expiration is...

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it processing now and and while that's running through I should mention we've got a special promotion code CLEAN25 that'll give you twenty-five percent off your next rental if you want me to add that to your account

Customer [en]: Wait, are you sure the payment went through already?

Customer Support [en]: Oh oh yes yes yes just cleared literally two seconds ago transaction confirmed TRX-88499-C all approved and I've updated your file so future rentals will charge this card instead of the old one

Customer [en]: That's such a relief, I was worried I'd have to reschedule everything...

Customer Support [en]: No no you're you're totally fine pickup anytime before six PM today at LOC-227 just give them confirmation number CNF-7749-RC and they'll have everything ready for you three day rental with the pet attachment all set
