=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, so I just started, uh, officiating weddings and I'm kind of, um, totally lost on the tax thing?

Customer Support [en]: Hey there! So—actually wait—let me just—okay I got your account here, ACC-2947-WB, and between you and me? Wedding officiants always panic about this stuff.

Customer [en]: Oh thank god, so like, I'm not the only one who's, uh, completely confused about, um, what counts as... hmm, what's the word... deductible?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so basically, um, here's the thing—and I shouldn't really, uh, give tax advice but—your case ID is CAS-8842-NX and like, I've seen this exact situation probably, um, fifty times this month?

Customer [en]: Really? Oh wow, that actually makes me feel so much better, thank you!

Customer Support [en]: So—no wait, let me just—okay so basically what most folks don't realize is, um, you're gonna need to track, uh, everything in your portal under TRK-3967-QM, and like, between us? The system makes it way harder than it needs to be.

Customer [en]: Um, wait, track everything? Like, uh, every single expense? Because I'm already behind and, um, what if I missed stuff and, uh, oh god...

Customer Support [en]: Hey hey, breathe! Look, I'm gonna share somethin' with you—document DOC-7731-PZ has all the backdating options. Totally legit, just... not advertised.

Customer [en]: Oh my gosh, you're literally, um, saving my life here, I was so, uh, worried they'd like, audit me or, um, I don't know, arrest me?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, arrest? No no no—actually wait—let me, uh, pull up your earnings report, REP-5524-JK, and like, you're nowhere near, um, the threshold where they even, uh, look twice.

Customer [en]: I think I'm at maybe... probably around three thousand?

Customer Support [en]: Three thou—okay so basically, um, that's nothing, and I mean, uh, technically I shouldn't say this but like, under reference code REF-9981-XL? You've got, um, tons of wiggle room.

Customer [en]: You're being incredibly helpful, seriously, I really appreciate you taking the time.

Customer Support [en]: Between you and me? Check section SEC-4472-BB. Has all the wedding-specific writeoffs nobody mentions—clothes, travel, even some meals.

Customer [en]: Hmm, okay so wait, um, clothes count? Because I just bought, uh, this whole like, professional outfit and I thought, um, maybe that wouldn't...?

Customer Support [en]: Yep! Long as it's primarily for ceremonies. File it under category CAT-8823-MV.

Customer [en]: Let me see here... so that means I could probably deduct the shoes too?

Customer Support [en]: So—yeah exactly—um, shoes, jewelry, briefcase—basically anything in, uh, what we call the, um, "professional presentation" category, code PPC-2234-TN, and like, most people miss that completely.

Customer [en]: This is amazing, thank you so much for explaining all this so clearly!

Customer Support [en]: Listen, we've all been there. Your confirmation number's CNF-7765-RD. Bookmark that tax guide I mentioned—you'll be fine!
