=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, I've been—I've been on hold for forty minutes and, uh, transferred twice already, okay?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! So, um, like, I can absolutely see what happened here. Let me just, uh, pull up your account and—okay so basically your reference number REF-4492-NL88 shows, um, multiple transfers and that's... that's not right. At all.

Customer [en]: I'm a locksmith, I—wait no—I run a locksmith business and, um, I really need this resolved.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. Got it.

Customer [en]: My van broke down and, uh, the insurance claim, it's it's been pending for, um, three weeks now?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm seeing claim number CLM-7739-XK here and, like, this is actually really interesting because, uh, there's a note that says—oh! Wait. I think I found the problem. So basically what happened was, um, the system flagged it as commercial but then, uh, processed it as personal?

Customer [en]: Are you—are you sure you can fix this? Because, um, I've got customers waiting and I just—I just can't keep canceling jobs.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely yes! So, um, like, here's what I'm gonna do. Your policy number POL-885544-TY shows you have, uh, commercial coverage and basically I'm updating the claim right now. Like, literally as we speak.

Customer [en]: Um, my wife's pregnant and we—we really need the income, you know? I can't—sorry, I mean, we can't afford this delay.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow. Okay. So, um, let me just, uh, escalate this differently then.

Customer [en]: Wait, escalate? No no no, please don't transfer me again!

Customer Support [en]: No! No no. So, um, I'm not transferring you anywhere, like, I'm actually just, uh, changing your priority code to PRI-URGENT-2A which basically means, um, your claim gets reviewed within 24 hours instead of the standard, uh, five to seven business days.

Customer [en]: Um, really? You can—you can do that?

Customer Support [en]: So like, um, technically I need manager approval but, uh, given your situation and the fact that you've been, um, bounced around for forty minutes? Yeah. I'm just. Doing it. Your new reference is REF-4492-NL88-PRIORITY.

Customer [en]: I just—I just need to know it'll actually happen this time, okay okay?

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: Because last Tuesday—wait no, Thursday—Thursday they said the same thing and, um, nothing happened.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, here's the difference. Like, what they did was just, uh, add a note to your file but, um, what I'm doing is actually changing your claim status to, uh, expedited review with tracking number TRK-9983-XM44. So basically you'll get, um, text updates every step.

Customer [en]: Um, you're—you're sure about the twenty-four hours? My mortgage is due and, uh, I'm already behind.

Customer Support [en]: Yes! So, um, like, I'm putting my employee ID EMP-7745 directly on this and, uh, basically if it doesn't process by tomorrow at, um, 3 PM your time? You call back. Ask for me. Sarah. And I will, like, personally walk this through myself.
