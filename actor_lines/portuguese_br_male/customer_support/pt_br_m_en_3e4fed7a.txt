=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, I just... the payment. It didn't... I can't even, uh, think straight right now.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, bulk tank payment. Let me, uh... what's the word... verify your account. Name?

Customer [en]: Jenkins. Jenkins Dairy. I think account... sorry, it's maybe 4-something?

Customer Support [en]: Got it, ACC-4892-JD. Yeah so, um, I see the issue here. Payment from, uh, yesterday's pickup bounced, and um, that's... hmm, that's definitely not good.

Customer [en]: I just... I can't...

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, deep breath. Your ACH failed code E47. Bank routing issue probably.

Customer [en]: Um, but the milk's gone, and uh, if they don't pay, I mean, I sort of... we need that money today.

Customer Support [en]: Listen, been doing this twelve years. REF-2024-0311-BD, that's your case. We expedite these.

Customer [en]: Are you sure? Because um, last time they said... wait no, that was... sorry, different thing.

Customer Support [en]: So um, here's what happens. I'm gonna, uh... what's it called... priority flag this. Your processor gets notification TXN-8847-MP in, hmm, twenty minutes tops.

Customer [en]: Twenty minutes. Okay. But what if...

Customer Support [en]: Already sent. Check your phone.

Customer [en]: Um, I don't... oh. Yeah. There's, uh, there's something here I think.

Customer Support [en]: That's confirmation MBL-0622. Sign that, send back. Money hits by noon.

Customer [en]: By noon? You're sure? Because, um, feed delivery's at two and I kind of need to, uh...

Customer Support [en]: Done hundreds of these. Um, your batch code BTK-4892-0311... hmm, what's the term... fast-tracked. So uh, actually might hit by eleven.

Customer [en]: Eleven would be... that would help. A lot.

Customer Support [en]: Quick tip. Set up backup ACH. Form FRM-2290-X.

Customer [en]: I should probably, um... yeah. Been meaning to. Just everything's been so, uh...

Customer Support [en]: I know. Rough season. But um, you're all set now. Case REF-2024-0311-BD shows, uh... yep, processing. Check your account at eleven.
