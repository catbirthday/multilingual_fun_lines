=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm I'm calling about my—my contract? I need to, uh, understand what I still... what's left on it?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Perfect timing actually. So let me just pull up your account here and—got it! I can see your contract number CTR-9982-AL right here, and basically what I'm seeing is you've got about fourteen months remaining on your current twenty-four month agreement that started back in October of last year.

Customer [en]: Fourteen? Wait, that's—that's not, um, I thought it was... are you sure that's right?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! So, um, let me break this down because, uh, I think I see what might be confusing here. Your contract ID CTR-9982-AL shows you signed up October fifteenth, and, um, today being December twentieth means you've completed ten months, so that leaves, uh, exactly fourteen months until October fifteenth next year.

Customer [en]: Um, okay okay, but what if I—what if I need to, uh, to get out? Like what's the... what's the word... the penalty?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! I see what happened here—so basically your early termination fee is calculated on a sliding scale, and looking at your account reference number ACC-7766-QM, you'd be looking at three hundred fifty dollars if you cancelled today, but that drops by twenty-five dollars each month you complete.

Customer [en]: Three fifty? That's... I just... I can't...

Customer Support [en]: Right right, I know that sounds like a lot! But, um, here's the thing—so I'm seeing in your file that, uh, you might actually qualify for our contract buyout program? Code PRO-2234-BB shows you've been a customer for, like, almost three years total across different contracts.

Customer [en]: Um, I don't, uh, I don't understand what that... are you sure? What does that mean exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So basically what that means is, um, we could potentially reduce that termination fee by, uh, let me calculate this... by about forty percent! That would bring it down to, um, two hundred ten dollars instead, and that's using discount code DSC-9901-XK which I can apply right now if you want.

Customer [en]: Two ten... that's that's better but, um, I still need to, uh, think about if I can even...

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: Um, what about, like, what happens to my, uh, my equipment? The the router thing and, um, you know...

Customer Support [en]: Oh excellent question! So, um, checking your equipment list under reference EQP-4455-TN, you've got our standard router-modem combo unit, and, uh, the good news is that's actually yours to keep—no return needed since you paid the equipment fee upfront when you started.

Customer [en]: Wait I paid for it? I don't—I don't remember... um, are you sure about that?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! I can see right here, transaction TXN-889234-LP from October shows a one-time equipment purchase of ninety-nine dollars, so basically that unit is completely yours whether you stay or go, which is, uh, actually pretty great because you could use it with another provider if needed.

Customer [en]: Um, okay, so so if I stay, uh, what happens after the fourteen months? Does it just... I mean, what's next?

Customer Support [en]: So here's where it gets interesting—your contract reference CTR-9982-AL automatically converts to month-to-month after October next year, which means, like, no more termination fees at all, and you can cancel anytime with just thirty days notice using form FRM-1100-CC.

Customer [en]: Month to month... um, that's that's good right? But the price, uh, does the price go up or...?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! So, um, actually your rate is locked through the contract period at fifty-nine ninety-nine, but, uh, after that—and this is where I can help—we usually see about a ten dollar increase, but if you call us maybe, like, a month before it ends, reference retention code RET-6678-MM, we can probably keep you at the same rate or maybe even lower!
