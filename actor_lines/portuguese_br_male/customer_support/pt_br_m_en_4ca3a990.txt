=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so I think, uh, my blender just stopped working and, er, I bought it maybe like eleven months ago? Or was it, um, thirteen? I'm sort of confused about the warranty thing.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no. That's—I'm so sorry. Let me just—wait, let me pull up. Can you give me your order number or—actually no, email works too?

Customer [en]: I think it's, um, probably in my emails somewhere but, uh, I don't really understand why it matters? Like, isn't it still kind of new?

Customer Support [en]: Right right. So um, here's the thing—and I really, uh, I hate this part—the warranty on model BLX-4400 is twelve months. Seeing here your purchase date was, er, let me—September third last year. Today's October eighth. So you're at thirteen months and, uh, five days.

Customer [en]: Wait, um, September? I thought it was maybe October or, er, November? That doesn't sound right.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, ummm, I'm looking at order ORD-9923-LK71 and it's, uh, definitely September third. Trust me, I know how frustrating—I mean, my coffee maker died at thirteen months too. Right after warranty. It's like they plan it.

Customer [en]: But it's only, um, it's probably just a month over? Maybe two? Can't you just, I don't know, sort of help anyway?

Customer Support [en]: I really wish I could. Like, um, genuinely. The system won't—it literally won't let me process warranty claims past, uh, past the date. Shows here expired status code EXP-1021. But listen, um, there might be something else we can do.

Customer [en]: I'm just... tired. Like what else is there even?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, between you and me? Sometimes if it's, uh, if it's this close to warranty end, I can escalate to, er, what we call a goodwill review. Case number GWR-7766-MP22. Not guaranteed but, ummm, they sometimes make exceptions. Takes maybe three days?

Customer [en]: Three days? Um, I don't really, er, understand what that means though? Like do I send it back or, um, what happens?

Customer Support [en]: No no. You keep it. So basically, uh, my supervisor reviews—sorry, the team reviews cases where it's like, just barely past warranty. I put notes about you being at thirteen months, loyal customer, all that.

Customer [en]: So maybe they'll, um, sort of fix it? Or probably not? I don't really know anymore.

Customer Support [en]: Honestly? With it being, um, just one month over? I'd say you've got a decent shot. I'm putting in my notes that, uh, "customer purchased in good faith, minimal usage past warranty period." Reference number REF-4109-XC. I mean, I had a similar case last week. Got approved.

Customer [en]: Um, okay but like, what if they say no? Then I just, er, have a broken blender?

Customer Support [en]: Well, ummm, if the goodwill thing doesn't—wait actually. Let me check. Yeah so even if that doesn't work, repair service code RPR-5512 shows, um, forty-nine dollars for out-of-warranty fix. Versus hundred twenty for new one. So there's that option.

Customer [en]: I just... forty-nine dollars. Whatever. Fine.

Customer Support [en]: Listen, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna push hard on this goodwill review. Like I'm literally typing right now that you're, er, you're considering just buying from our competitor next time. That usually—sorry, that sometimes helps. Ticket GTX-9988-LM44 submitted.

Customer [en]: Um, I think, er, I probably should just buy a different brand anyway, right? This is sort of ridiculous that it breaks right after twelve months.

Customer Support [en]: You know what? Off the record? I don't blame you. But um, let me at least, uh, let's see what happens with case GWR-7766-MP22 first. I put my direct extension in the notes. 4-8-1-7. If they deny it, call me back. I'll find—we'll figure something out.
