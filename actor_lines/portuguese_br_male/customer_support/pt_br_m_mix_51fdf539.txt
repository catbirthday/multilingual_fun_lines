=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [mix]: Hi, look, I know you're prob'bly busy but I need help with discounts.

Customer Support [mix]: Oh no worries at all! So basically I can definitely help you with that—let me just pull up our discount programs here in system DIS-9847-QR.

Customer [mix]: Thanks for bein' patient. Just need to know 'bout student or senior rates.

Customer Support [mix]: Absolutely! So we have both actually—the student discount is 15% off with valid ID, and basically senior discount starts at age 65, that's 20% off.

Customer [mix]: That's great. How'd I know this is legit though? Not some bait thing?

Customer Support [mix]: Oh totally understand! So basically all our discounts are registered under policy POL-2024-VK3, and like, you can verify that on our website's terms page.

Customer [mix]: Mm. What proof you need? For for the senior one.

Customer Support [mix]: Right, so for seniors we just need a government-issued ID showing birthdate—driver's license works perfectly. Upload it to portal SEC-7739-BD and basically it processes instantly.

Customer [mix]: How do I know my ID's safe with you? Data breaches ev'rywhere now.

Customer Support [mix]: That's such a valid concern! So like, our verification system VER-8821-PX uses bank-level encryption, and basically we delete the image after verification—never stored.

Customer [mix]: Okay okay. Look, not your fault if it's complicated. Just cautious.

Customer Support [mix]: No, I really appreciate that! So basically being careful is smart—let me walk you through exactly how it works, step by step, okay?

Customer [mix]: Sure. You seem straight with me. What's first?

Customer Support [mix]: Perfect! So first, you'd go to account settings, then click "Apply Discount"—that generates request number REQ-6632-AA—and basically from there it guides you through uploading.

Customer [mix]: Wait. Why's it need a request number? Seems like trackin' me.

Customer Support [mix]: Oh that's just for your protection actually! So like, the number REQ-6632-AA lets you check status anytime, and basically if anything goes wrong, we can fix it faster.

Customer [mix]: Hm. S'pose that makes sense. Know you're just doin' your job here.

Customer Support [mix]: Thanks for understanding! So once approved—usually takes like five minutes—you'll get confirmation code starting with CNF, and basically the discount applies to everything automatically.

Customer [mix]: Good. One more thing—this retroactive? Got an order last week.

Customer Support [mix]: So unfortunately discounts only apply going forward, but like—let me check something. Your recent order ORD-9981-TM? Basically I can issue a courtesy credit for the difference, just this once.
