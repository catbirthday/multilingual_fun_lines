Customer: Hi. Um, I'm probably calling the wrong department but, uh, I need to... it's about a prepaid account? For someone who's... passed.
1. Oh! Um, no no, you're definitely in the right place! So, uh, first of all, let me just say I'm, um, really sorry for your loss. Er, let me just pull up our, uh, prepaid transfer system here and we'll get this sorted out for you, okay?
Customer: I'm sorry. I should've had the account number ready. I'm—I'm just looking. One second.
2. Um, that's totally fine! Take your time. So while you're looking, uh, I can actually start with just, er, the account holder's name? And then, um, once you find it we'll need the account number which should be like, uh, something like PPA-7823-MK or similar format.
Customer: Margaret Chen. That's—that's the name. Found it. PPA... um, what's that... PPA-4451-JX.
3. Perfect! Okay so, um, I've got Margaret Chen here with account PPA-4451-JX and, uh, I can see this was, er, set up back in 2019. Now, um, for the transfer process—and this is, uh, pretty straightforward I promise—I'll need to verify you're authorized?
Customer: Right. Of course. I probably should've mentioned. Wilson Funeral Home. I'm—I'm the director.
4. Oh excellent, that makes this easier! So, um, let me just, uh, update that here. Wilson Funeral Home. And, er, I'll need your license number which should be like, um, FDL followed by some digits?
Customer: Um, it's FDL-8827... no wait. Sorry. FDL-8227-TX. I always—I always mix those up.
5. No worries at all! Happens all the time. So, uh, FDL-8227-TX for Wilson Funeral Home, got it. Um, now the system is, er, generating a transfer authorization code which will be, uh, TAC-9916-MC and that's basically your reference for this whole thing.
Customer: Should I—should I be writing this down? Um, TAC... sorry, what was it?
6. Oh yes! Definitely write it down. So that's TAC-9916-MC. Um, and actually, er, I'm also gonna email this to you but, uh, having it written is always good. So, um, the transfer includes, let me see here, the full service package valued at, er, $8,750.
Customer: Okay. Good. That's... I think that's right? Are you sure that covers everything the family selected?
7. Um, absolutely! So I can see here it's, uh, the complete package. Let me just, er, read through this. It's got the, um, viewing services, the ceremony, transportation, and, uh, all the standard preparations. Everything under reference SKU-3847-PRM.
Customer: Right. Right right. And the... what's the... the timing? When does this actually, um, transfer over?
8. So, um, great question! The transfer is, uh, basically immediate once I submit it here. But, er, the funds release to your facility will be, um, within 24-48 hours. You'll get a confirmation at, uh, let me see, transaction ID TRN-55831-QZ should appear in your merchant portal.
Customer: I just—I just want to make sure. Nothing's going to. Delay. Or hold this up?
9. Oh, I completely understand your concern! Um, so everything looks, er, perfectly set up here. No holds, no issues. The system shows green lights across the board. Uh, and just to reassure you, if anything does come up—which it won't—but if it does, you can reference case number CSE-7249-NP and we'll expedite it immediately.
Customer: Okay okay. Thank you. I'm probably. Overthinking. But these things are just... you know?
10. No no, you're being thorough and that's, um, exactly what you should be doing! These are, uh, really important matters and, er, you want everything perfect for the family. So, um, you're all set now. The transfer's processing under confirmation CFM-8839-RT and, uh, you should see everything in your system within those 24-48 hours. Is there, er, anything else I can help clarify?
Customer: Um, hi, so I just started, uh, officiating weddings and I'm kind of, um, totally lost on the tax thing?
11. Hey there! So—actually wait—let me just—okay I got your account here, ACC-2947-WB, and between you and me? Wedding officiants always panic about this stuff.
Customer: Oh thank god, so like, I'm not the only one who's, uh, completely confused about, um, what counts as... hmm, what's the word... deductible?
12. Right right, so basically, um, here's the thing—and I shouldn't really, uh, give tax advice but—your case ID is CAS-8842-NX and like, I've seen this exact situation probably, um, fifty times this month?
Customer: Really? Oh wow, that actually makes me feel so much better, thank you!
13. So—no wait, let me just—okay so basically what most folks don't realize is, um, you're gonna need to track, uh, everything in your portal under TRK-3967-QM, and like, between us? The system makes it way harder than it needs to be.
Customer: Um, wait, track everything? Like, uh, every single expense? Because I'm already behind and, um, what if I missed stuff and, uh, oh god...
14. Hey hey, breathe! Look, I'm gonna share somethin' with you—document DOC-7731-PZ has all the backdating options. Totally legit, just... not advertised.
Customer: Oh my gosh, you're literally, um, saving my life here, I was so, uh, worried they'd like, audit me or, um, I don't know, arrest me?
15. Okay so, um, arrest? No no no—actually wait—let me, uh, pull up your earnings report, REP-5524-JK, and like, you're nowhere near, um, the threshold where they even, uh, look twice.
Customer: I think I'm at maybe... probably around three thousand?
16. Three thou—okay so basically, um, that's nothing, and I mean, uh, technically I shouldn't say this but like, under reference code REF-9981-XL? You've got, um, tons of wiggle room.
Customer: You're being incredibly helpful, seriously, I really appreciate you taking the time.
17. Between you and me? Check section SEC-4472-BB. Has all the wedding-specific writeoffs nobody mentions—clothes, travel, even some meals.
Customer: Hmm, okay so wait, um, clothes count? Because I just bought, uh, this whole like, professional outfit and I thought, um, maybe that wouldn't...?
18. Yep! Long as it's primarily for ceremonies. File it under category CAT-8823-MV.
Customer: Let me see here... so that means I could probably deduct the shoes too?
19. So—yeah exactly—um, shoes, jewelry, briefcase—basically anything in, uh, what we call the, um, "professional presentation" category, code PPC-2234-TN, and like, most people miss that completely.
Customer: This is amazing, thank you so much for explaining all this so clearly!
20. Listen, we've all been there. Your confirmation number's CNF-7765-RD. Bookmark that tax guide I mentioned—you'll be fine!
Customer: Look, I just need to know what's actually covered here.
21. Oh, um, absolutely, yes, so I can definitely, uh, help you understand your coverage and, um, let me just pull up your account here—could you, er, give me your policy number or, uh, the account number starting with POL?
Customer: It's, uh... what's the... POL-4429.
22. Perfect, um, okay so I'm seeing POL-4429-BK7 here and, uh, just to confirm—this is for the, um, the comprehensive package you signed up for in, er, let me see here, September, and I want to make sure I'm, uh, looking at the right coverage details for you.
Customer: Yeah. September. So what's in it?
23. Right, so, um, with your comprehensive package POL-4429-BK7, you've got, uh, quite a bit included here—there's the, um, basic coverage which is your standard protection, and then, er, you've also got the enhanced benefits addon with code ENH-7734 which gives you, uh, extended coverage for specialist visits.
Customer: Specialists. Okay. What about, um... what's the word... preventative stuff?
24. Oh yes! Um, so preventative care is, uh, actually one of the best parts of your plan—you get, er, annual checkups, routine screenings, and, um, immunizations all covered at, uh, one hundred percent with no copay under benefit code PRV-5512-A.
Customer: Really? No copay for that...
25. Um, exactly, yes, no copay at all for preventative services, and, uh, let me just double-check here—yep, confirmed under PRV-5512-A, and, er, that also includes, um, wellness visits and basic lab work when it's, uh, part of your annual screening.
Customer: Huh. They didn't mention... okay what about dental?
26. So, um, dental is where it gets a bit, er, different—your plan POL-4429-BK7 includes, uh, basic dental coverage but it's, um, limited to preventative dental only, so that's cleanings twice a year under code DNT-0981, but, er, major work would need supplemental coverage.
Customer: Um, so like, cavities would be...?
27. Right, um, so cavities—those would fall under, uh, what we call basic restorative care, and, er, with your current plan those are covered at, um, sixty percent after you meet your deductible which is, uh, let me see here, DED-1500 shows five hundred dollars.
Customer: Five hundred. That's not... terrible I guess...
28. Um, yeah, it's actually, er, pretty reasonable compared to—oh! Wait, I'm seeing something here—you, uh, you actually have a credit of two hundred dollars from code CRD-8823-M that can apply toward your deductible, so, um, effectively it's three hundred for you.
Customer: Wait really? How'd that happen?
29. So, um, looking at the notes here under transaction TXN-994521, it looks like, uh, you had an overpayment from a previous claim that got, er, credited back to your account in October, and, um, it automatically applies to your next deductible amount.
Customer: That's... actually helpful. Thanks for finding that.
30. Oh, um, of course! I'm just, uh, really glad I caught that—it's easy to miss but, er, your account summary under SUM-7765-X shows you've got that credit plus, um, actually really solid coverage overall, and, uh, is there anything else about your benefits you'd like me to clarify?
Customer: Um, I just... the payment. It didn't... I can't even, uh, think straight right now.
31. Right right, bulk tank payment. Let me, uh... what's the word... verify your account. Name?
Customer: Jenkins. Jenkins Dairy. I think account... sorry, it's maybe 4-something?
32. Got it, ACC-4892-JD. Yeah so, um, I see the issue here. Payment from, uh, yesterday's pickup bounced, and um, that's... hmm, that's definitely not good.
Customer: I just... I can't...
33. Okay okay, deep breath. Your ACH failed code E47. Bank routing issue probably.
Customer: Um, but the milk's gone, and uh, if they don't pay, I mean, I sort of... we need that money today.
34. Listen, been doing this twelve years. REF-2024-0311-BD, that's your case. We expedite these.
Customer: Are you sure? Because um, last time they said... wait no, that was... sorry, different thing.
35. So um, here's what happens. I'm gonna, uh... what's it called... priority flag this. Your processor gets notification TXN-8847-MP in, hmm, twenty minutes tops.
Customer: Twenty minutes. Okay. But what if...
36. Already sent. Check your phone.
Customer: Um, I don't... oh. Yeah. There's, uh, there's something here I think.
37. That's confirmation MBL-0622. Sign that, send back. Money hits by noon.
Customer: By noon? You're sure? Because, um, feed delivery's at two and I kind of need to, uh...
38. Done hundreds of these. Um, your batch code BTK-4892-0311... hmm, what's the term... fast-tracked. So uh, actually might hit by eleven.
Customer: Eleven would be... that would help. A lot.
39. Quick tip. Set up backup ACH. Form FRM-2290-X.
Customer: I should probably, um... yeah. Been meaning to. Just everything's been so, uh...
40. I know. Rough season. But um, you're all set now. Case REF-2024-0311-BD shows, uh... yep, processing. Check your account at eleven.
Customer: Yeah hi. I think—no wait, I'm calling back about, um, ticket REF-something.
41. Oh, um, hello there, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—hmm, do you happen to have that reference number? I can also, er, search by phone number if that's, um, if that's easier for you...
Customer: Sort of resolved already. Just, um, following up.
42. Right right, okay so, um, I'm seeing here—oh wait, is this about ticket REF-2024-88421? That was, uh, marked as resolved yesterday at, let me see here, 4:17 PM Eastern, and it looks like—hmm, actually this is interesting...
Customer: That's it. Worked out.
43. Oh! Um, wow, so you're actually—you're calling to, uh, to say it worked? That's, er, that's really nice actually, we don't usually—I mean, most of the time people only call when things are, you know...
Customer: Company policy. We're supposed to, um, confirm resolutions.
44. Mmm hmm, I see, well that's, um, that's very thorough of you, let me just update the ticket here with confirmation code CNF-94412-A to show that you've, uh, verified everything is working as expected.
Customer: The tech—I think he, um, really knew his stuff. Probably should mention that.
45. Oh that's, uh, that's Agent Mitchell, badge ID AGT-7734, and I'm definitely, um, going to add that to his file because, er, we track positive feedback and it really does, you know, make a difference for evaluations and...
Customer: Mitchell. Right. Fixed it fast.
46. Yeah he's, um, he's one of our senior techs, been here for, uh, let me see, wow almost six years now, and honestly between you and me he's probably the best we have for those, er, for those complex integration issues.
Customer: Do you, um, need anything else? Reference number or, uh, maybe account details?
47. No no, I've got everything here in ticket REF-2024-88421, your account ACC-50923-K is all updated, and, um, I'm just adding a note here that you called to confirm successful resolution, which honestly is, uh, it's making my day a bit better...
Customer: Good. That's—yeah, good then.
48. Is there, um, anything else I can help you with today? I mean, er, since I have your account pulled up and, uh, I'm seeing you've been with us for, hmm, three years now so if there's anything at all...
Customer: Actually, um, one thing. My status level. Should be, uh, should be platinum.
49. Oh! Yes, um, absolutely, let me just—okay so I'm seeing here that you're currently at gold level but with your, uh, your usage metrics you definitely qualify for platinum, case number UPG-2024-66239, and I'm just, er, I'm upgrading that right now actually...
Customer: About time. I mean, um, three years, right? Kind of expected.
50. Totally understand, and, um, you're absolutely right, this should have been automatic at your level, so I've, uh, I've applied it retroactively to January first with credit code CRD-8847-PL, which means you'll see about, er, let me calculate here... roughly a $240 credit on your next statement.
Character 1: So, um, I've been [chateado] looking at this synthesis pathway, you know, and actually, I don't think the Grignard reagent is going to work here.
51. Oh, you're absolutely right to question that! The presence of that acidic hydrogen on the hydroxyl group would definitely kill the Grignard before it could react with the carbonyl.
Character 1: Right, er, that's what I mean, basically, we need to protect that alcohol first.
52. Well, we could use a silyl protecting group, sort of, like TBS or TIPS, uhh, which would be stable under the basic conditions. Plus they're easy to remove later with just some fluoride source, you know what I mean?
Character 1: TBS might be overkill though, don't you think?
53. Hmm, you have a point there, the thing is, like, for this particular substrate, even a simple acetyl group would probably do the trick. It's cheaper too, and we can cleave it with mild base after the Grignard addition.
Character 1: Ah, but honestly, wouldn't the acetyl group be kind of susceptible to nucleophilic attack itself?
54. True, true, but remember the Grignard preferentially attacks the aldehyde over the ester - it's way more electrophilic. The kinetics really favor the aldehyde addition, especially if we keep things cold.
Character 1: What temperature are we talking?
55. So, I'd start at negative seventy-eight, anyway, then warm slowly to negative forty, I guess, just to maintain selectivity. We did something similar last month with that benzaldehyde derivative, remember? Got like ninety-two percent yield with minimal side products.
Character 1: Uh, that's really conservative though, it's just that we might not need to go that cold.
56. Ha! You're probably [gargalhada] right, I'm being overly cautious again! But hey, better safe than dealing with a mess of byproducts, especially when the starting material costs what it does.
Character 1: Right so, err, what about using zinc instead, probably less reactive but more selective?
57. Okay so, organozinc reagents, you see, they're definitely gentler, actually, but the transmetallation can be tricky. You'd need to make the zinc reagent from the Grignard first, or use Rieke zinc, which is a whole other headache with handling and storage.
Character 1: Umm, here's the thing, [bem alto] I already ordered the zinc dust, well, so we might as well try it!
58. Oh wow, you already— [pigarreando] okay then, that changes things! We'll need to activate that zinc properly though, maybe with some iodine or TMSCl to get a clean surface for the reaction to proceed.
Character 1: I was thinking 1,2-dibromoethane for activation.
59. Oh, that's [empolgado] perfect, like, dibromoethane is my go-to activator, you know! It gives you that nice color change when the zinc's ready, plus the ethylene just bubbles off harmlessly, no messy byproducts to deal with.
Character 1: Hmmm, how much catalyst do we need, basically, for this scale, I think?
60. For a fifty millimole scale, anyway, I'd use about five mole percent, honestly, though you could probably get away with less, sort of, if your zinc is fresh. The key is adding it slowly while monitoring the temperature - you'll see that characteristic fizzing when it's working.
Character 1: Um, we're implementing OKRs and, well, trying to establish psychological safety metrics, kind of simultaneously.
61. Perfect timing for that collision. Most organizations try to sequence those initiatives, but tackling both creates productive friction that accelerates cultural maturity.
Character 1: So, the leadership team is, you know, resistant to vulnerability exercises - honestly, they're calling them performative.
62. Er, that resistance is, I mean, valuable data - basically it signals they're recognizing the gap between authentic vulnerability and theater. Push them to design their own vulnerability protocols instead of importing generic ones.
Character 1: Hmm, our employee resource groups are, actually, fragmenting rather than cohering - the thing is, they're becoming siloed.
63. Fragmentation often precedes [tosse] meaningful integration. Let those ERGs develop strong individual identities first; forced unity without authentic connection just creates surface-level compliance, not genuine collaboration.
Character 1: What about our remote-first principles conflicting with collaboration needs?
64. That tension is [very quickly] exposing whether your collaboration model requires presence or actual engagement. Document every friction point - they're revealing assumptions about how work actually gets done versus how you think it does.
Character 1: Uh, middle management keeps undermining the flat hierarchy experiments, anyway, reverting to command structures, sort of unconsciously.
65. Excellent - their reversion patterns map your actual power dynamics versus aspirational ones. Use their resistance to identify which hierarchical functions serve legitimate coordination needs versus pure status preservation.
Character 1: Our diversity metrics improved but belonging scores dropped.
66. Uhh, that divergence is, right so, diagnostically rich - like, it indicates you're achieving compositional diversity without, I guess, addressing systemic inclusion barriers. The discomfort reveals where your cultural operating system needs fundamental rewrites.
Character 1: Ah, the innovation labs are, really, producing nothing actionable - it's just that they're disconnected from core operations.
67. Hmmm, failed innovation labs are, you know, incredibly instructive - anyway, they expose whether your organization actually has, essentially, the risk tolerance for genuine experimentation. Their isolation might be protecting your ability to fail safely.
Character 1: Should we abandon the culture transformation altogether?
68. Err, no - actually, these failure modes are, here's the thing, exactly what successful transformations encounter at the eighteen-month mark. You're experiencing system immune response, which means you're actually changing something substantial.
Character 1: Our engagement surveys show increasing polarization between departments.
69. Umm, that polarization is, well, [sussurrando] potentially your most valuable signal - sort of showing where subcultures are crystallizing. Strong subcultures that clash productively often outperform homogeneous cultures that avoid conflict entirely.
Character 1: How do we know if we're making progress versus just creating chaos?
70. Track conflict resolution velocity, not conflict absence. If teams are surfacing tensions faster and resolving them with decreasing management intervention, you're building genuine cultural capacity, not just rearranging dysfunction.
Character 1: [atônito] I haven't been to this estate in, [voz embargada], twenty years but that scar on your hand from the, [tremendo], broken wine bottle—it's you, isn't it, [quase inaudível], Sofia?
71. [sem fôlego] Michael? Um, I mean, is that really—well, after all this time standing here in, [descrença], work clothes covered in soot like we're kids playing in the, uhh, old manor again. [laughs shakily]
Character 1: God, Sofia.
72. [emocionado] You disappeared after the, [voz falhando], fire—your whole family just vanished and I, umm, spent years wondering if you were even, [engasgando], alive, and well, here you are cleaning my chimney like, uhh, some cosmic joke.
Character 1: [gentil] We had to leave after dad was blamed for the vineyard burning even though we both, [cuidadoso], knew it wasn't his fault.
73. [urgente] I tried to tell them you were with me that, [desesperado], night, that your father couldn't have started it, but nobody would, [frustrado], listen to a twelve-year-old girl.
Character 1: [pesado] Well, umm, I became what everyone already thought we were—just, uh, working class people cleaning up after the, [amargo], wealthy, you know?
74. [intenso] You were never just anything to me, [feroz], Michael—you were my entire world before everything fell apart.
Character 1: I thought about writing, um, so many times but, well, what would I even say after, [vazio], your family lost everything because of that fire, I mean.
75. [rising] We didn't lose everything—grandfather rebuilt the vineyard from, [determinado], nothing and left it to me when he passed.
Character 1: [carinhoso] I heard you became the youngest vineyard manager in the region, and umm, every time I drive past those hills, well, I think about the promises we, [melancólico], made as kids.
76. [suave] Remember how we carved our initials in that oak tree by the, [nostálgico], old cellar before everything changed?
Character 1: [concentrated] The tree survived the fire and grew around, [wondering], our marks—I checked last spring when I cleaned the Hendersons' place, [significativo], next door.
77. [crescendo] So you've been, umm, working in this area all along, just, [sobrecarregado], miles away from where we used to dream about running this place, [voz embargada], together, and I mean, you never once thought to knock on my door?
Character 1: [focused] Every single day I thought about it but, um, showing up covered in soot to clean the, [dolorido], chimneys of the girl who was supposed to be my future felt like, well, admitting defeat.
78. You're not defeated—you're, [feroz], here, you're alive, and that oak tree isn't the only thing that, [apaixonado], grew around what we carved into, [tremendo], this world.
Character 1: [thick] Um, Sofia, I—well.
79. [resoluto] Stay for dinner after you finish—we have twenty years to, [caloroso], catch up on and a bottle of the vintage from the year before everything changed.
Character 1: [crescendo] I still remember how you said the grapes that year tasted like, [emocionado], hope, how we snuck into the cellar and made plans to blend a wine that would, [voz falhando], tell our story, and now you're actually, [maravilhado], living it.
80. [loving] Not living it alone though—I mean, not anymore, because, well, you're standing in my doorway and, umm, maybe that's the ending our story was, [esperançoso], always meant to have.
Character 1: [dazed] Well, um, I've been running this machine for, uh, fifteen years and never once had the blade slip, [descrente], like that during a demonstration, I mean, especially not with cameras rolling.
81. [em pânico] Um, there's so much blood.
Character 1: [calm] The funny thing is I can't even, [detached], feel it yet which probably means the nerves are still in shock.
82. Listen, um, I need you to keep that hand elevated while I, [frenético], try to remember where they keep the first aid kit because, well, my whole crew just ran off to find help and I'm, [scattered], completely lost in this factory layout, you know?
Character 1: You know, it's actually kind of ironic that we were filming the, [weak laugh], safety video when this happened, um, maybe you can use this as a what-not-to-do segment, right?
83. [tranquilizador] Just keep talking to me while I wrap this, [focused], tourniquet around your wrist to slow the bleeding down.
Character 1: [rambling] I mean, my wife's gonna be so mad because, um, I promised her I'd be extra careful today since, well, she's been worried about these old machines and, uh, here I am proving her right.
84. Your color's getting better now that we've got pressure on it, [aliviado], though we definitely need to get you to medical within the next few minutes.
Character 1: [woozy] You know you're pretty good at this for someone who probably spends most of their time, [appreciative], behind a desk writing press releases and, [voz sumindo], organizing photo shoots.
85. [confession] Well, I was actually an EMT for, um, three years before I got into corporate communications, so, uh, blood doesn't really bother me the way it, [gentil], used to when I first started.
Character 1: [surpreso] That explains why you didn't just, [impressed], faint like that new intern did last month when Jimmy got his finger caught in the, [chuckling], hydraulic press.
86. [firme] The bleeding's almost stopped now which is, [encorajador], a really good sign that we didn't hit anything major.
Character 1: Um, I keep thinking about how this is gonna look on the incident report, you know, 'veteran operator injures himself while showing off for, [envergonhado], corporate video crew' and, well, I'll never hear the end of it.
87. [tranquilizador] Nobody needs to know you were demonstrating an advanced technique when the, [cuidadoso], safety guard malfunctioned because technically the camera wasn't even, [conspiratorial], recording at that moment.
Character 1: [grato] You'd really edit that part out of the, [esperançoso], footage for me even though it would probably make great training material?
88. Look, accidents happen even to the most, [compreensivo], experienced people and making you look bad won't help anyone, [firme], learn anything useful. [suspira]
Character 1: [weary] Well, um, I guess we should probably head to the medical station now before I, uh, start feeling whatever pain is definitely coming once this, [nervoso], adrenaline wears off, you know?
89. [apoiando] Um, yeah, let's go.
Character 1: Thanks for not completely freaking out on me because most people would've just, [sincero], run away at the first sight of blood.
90. [caloroso] Hey, we're all just trying to look out for each other here, [pensativo], and besides, this'll make one hell of a story at the next, [mais leve], company meeting.
Character 1: Um, I don't mean to, [atônito], stare but you look exactly like, well, someone I used to, [tremendo], know a long time ago, uh, before everything changed. [exala]
91. That's a weird thing to, [uncomfortable], say to someone just trying to buy, [defensivo], organic chicken at a farmer's market on a Saturday, [frio], morning.
Character 1: No, I mean, it's just that you have, [searching], the same eyes as my daughter who I, um, haven't seen since, [quebrado], the divorce papers were signed eighteen years ago.
92. Your daughter would be, [calculating], nineteen now which happens to be exactly how old I am, [percebendo], but that's probably just a coincidence. [riso nervoso]
Character 1: Her mother changed her last name to, [cuidadoso], Mitchell after she remarried and moved to this exact town, [vazio], which is why I started selling here.
93. [frozen] My last name is Mitchell and my mom, [tremendo], always gets weird when I ask about my biological father who she says, [amargo], worked in food processing before he, [voz sumindo], abandoned us.
Character 1: [quiet] I never abandoned anyone, I just, [dolorido], lost the custody battle.
94. [cortante] That's not what she told me for, [zangado], eighteen years of birthdays you never showed up for, [acusatório], or graduation ceremonies you missed.
Character 1: [desesperado] Well, I sent cards, um, every single year but they always came back, [derrotado], marked return to sender, I mean, I tried.
95. [wavering] Um, she said you never even, [confuso], tried to contact us, like, not once after you left.
Character 1: [firme] I have boxes of returned letters in my truck right now if you, [sincero], want to see them.
96. [atônito] I don't, um, understand why she would, [lost], lie about something like that for, well, my entire life. [voz embargada]
Character 1: [gentil] Maybe she thought she was protecting you from, [triste], disappointment or maybe she was protecting herself from, [compreensivo], having to share you.
97. [amargo] Well, um, protecting me from what exactly, I mean, from knowing my father actually, [voz falhando], gave a damn about me?
Character 1: [sussurrado] I'm sorry.
98. Sorry doesn't give me back, [zangado], eighteen years of thinking I wasn't worth fighting for when apparently you were, [voz falhando], fighting the whole time just to, [soluçando], send me a birthday card.
Character 1: [firme] I know it doesn't change anything but I've been, [emocionado], setting up at this market every weekend for three years hoping, [voz embargada], you might walk by. [pausa]
99. Three years of Saturdays just standing here with your, [descrença], organic chickens waiting for me?
Character 1: [suave] Three years of Saturdays watching every teenager walk by hoping to see, [choroso], my daughter's face.
100. [exausto] I need to, [sobrecarregado], go process this somewhere that isn't in front of a poultry stand but maybe, [tentative], maybe we could talk again next, [esperançoso], Saturday.
Character 1: Look, um, I don't know who you are or, [desdenhoso], how you got backstage, but uh, security needs to escort you out right now, like, immediately.
101. [furioso] That track you just, [tremendo], dropped at midnight—the one that made everyone, [voz embargada], lose their minds—that's MY song you stole!
Character 1: [defensivo] I have absolutely, [incrédulo], no idea what you're talking about because every single track I play is either, [firmemente], licensed properly or created in my own studio with my team, [scoffs], period.
102. [tremendo] I sent you that demo, [desesperado], six months ago through your label's submission portal—'Neon Prophecy,' remember that name? [riso amargo]
Character 1: [condescending] Kid, do you have any idea, [exausto], how many demos I get sent every single day from wannabe producers who all think they've created, [zombando], the next big thing that'll change the industry, [eye roll], forever?
103. [heated] This isn't about being a wannabe—I have the, [apaixonado], original project files, the timestamps, everything that proves you literally, [acusatório], ripped off my work! [slams fist]
Character 1: [aggressive] You better watch what you're, [threatening], accusing me of because my lawyers absolutely love dealing with delusional fans who think, [dangerous], they can make false claims. [steps closer]
104. Um, uh, you're scared.
Character 1: [laughing coldly] Scared of what exactly—some nobody who probably, [contemptuous], made a generic four-on-the-floor beat and thinks they invented house music? [shakes head]
105. [determinado] Well, um, I recorded our entire conversation and, [confident], I've got proof that'll destroy your reputation when this goes viral, so, uh, maybe we should talk about proper credit, like, right now.
Character 1: [suddenly serious] Recording me without consent is illegal in this state, and, [menacing], you just admitted to it in front of witnesses.
106. [firme] Your manager already knows about this because I sent them, [calculated], the cease and desist letter this morning before your set. [smirks]
Character 1: [rattled] That's impossible because my team would have, [nervoso], told me immediately if there was any legal issue, especially something, [frenético], this serious.
107. [triumphant] Check your phone—I bet they've been trying to, [sabendo], reach you all night while you were too busy playing MY track to, [vindictive], thousands of people who paid to hear original music, not stolen, [enojado], beats. [crosses arms]
Character 1: [panicking] Even if there was some similarity, which there, [defensivo], isn't, coincidences happen in music all the time because we all use, [desesperado], the same software, same samples, same, [voz sumindo], same everything... [pulls out phone]
108. [frio] Um, that specific synth progression at two minutes fourteen seconds, well, [precise], that's my girlfriend's voice chopped up and pitched down—er, how exactly is that a coincidence?
Character 1: [derrotado] Wait, that vocal chop was from, [atônito], a sample pack I bought—my assistant said it was, [percebendo], cleared and original content from the label.
109. [firme] Like, your assistant is my ex-business partner who, um, [revealing], stole my entire hard drive when we split, and I guess, [amargo], he's been selling my work to, well, [áspero], the highest bidder—congratulations on being played.
Character 1: [chocado] This can't be happening—my entire career is, [desesperado], built on authenticity and if this gets out, [terrified], everything I've worked for is completely destroyed.
110. [resoluto] Well, um, here's what's going to happen—you're going to, [commanding], publicly credit me as co-producer, pay me what I'm owed, and, uh, [final], we're going to have a very long conversation about your assistant, like, tonight. [extends hand]

Character 1: [territorial] This is my place, been living here for, [aggressive], three years without anybody bothering me and now you just burst in here bleeding everywhere.
111. Please, I just need, um, [desesperado], somewhere to hide for a few hours, I mean, they're going to kill me if they find me out there.
Character 1: [cético] What kind of trouble are you in that has you, um, [wary], running into abandoned buildings at midnight, I mean, [mais baixo], looking like death already caught up with you? [scoffs]
112. [tremendo] I testified against some, uh, [terrified], very dangerous people who don't believe in, well, [voz embargada], second chances or witness protection that actually, um, [amargo], protects anyone.
Character 1: [mais suave] Damn. [pausa longa]
113. [arrependido] Look, I know what it's like to lose, [quebrado], everything you've built, your safe space, your, [voz sumindo], sense of security in this world.
Character 1: [áspero] You don't know anything about losing everything until you've, [zangado], watched your family walk away because the nightmares from Afghanistan made you too, [voz embargada], dangerous to be around your own, [sussurrado], children.
114. [gentil] I had to, um, [dolorido], send my daughter away three states over because they, well, [tremendo], threatened to do things to her that I can't even say out loud. [engasgando]
Character 1: [surpreso] Jesus, that's why you're bleeding, [compreensivo], they already found you once tonight and you barely, [impressed], got away alive but you're still, [admirando], standing here fighting.
115. [exausto] Still standing, [vazio], barely. [suspira pesadamente]
Character 1: There's a hidden spot behind the boiler room that even the, [conspiratorial], cops don't know about when they do their sweeps, and it's, [helpful], warmer down there too. [mais suave]
116. Why would you help me after I just, [confuso], invaded your home and brought danger to the only, [grato], place you felt safe? [voz embargada]
Character 1: Because I remember what it's like to have, [melancholic], people hunting you, even if mine were just, [darkly amused], memories and ghosts instead of real bullets, and nobody, [firme], deserves to face that alone.
117. [emocionado] In my old life I walked past people like you, [envergonhado], every single day without even making eye contact, [arrependido], thinking I was somehow better or more deserving of, [voz falhando], basic human dignity.
Character 1: [sábio] The streets teach you that we're all just, [filosófico], one bad day away from switching places with anyone, [matter-of-fact], else out here.
118. [determinado] If I survive this, I won't, [promising], forget what you did tonight. [pausa]
Character 1: [resignado] Survival's all any of us can focus on right, [weary], now, but maybe when your hunters are gone you can, [esperançoso], help me find my way back to my kids somehow, [vulnerável], show them their dad's still worth knowing. [trails off]
119. [firme] I was a family lawyer before all this, um, [determinado], went to hell, and I swear if we both, well, [emocionado], make it through tonight, I'll help you fight to, uh, [apaixonado], see them again.
Character 1: [tocado] Come on, let's get you hidden before they, um, [urgente], start checking buildings, because I mean, [protetor], I've already lost too much to let death win another round, well, [feroz], not in my house. [determinado]
120. [grato] Thank you for, uh, [choroso], seeing me as human when I'm at my, um, [vulnerável], most inhuman moment.
Customer: Então, hum, deixa eu ver aqui... tô ligando sobre a reclamação da minha van de trabalho que foi negada?
121. Certo, é, eu posso—hmm, eu posso com certeza ver isso. Hum, só preciso do número da reclamação, ééé, deve começar com CLM e depois, ah, alguns números?
Customer: CLM-4492-BV. Eles só disseram não. Sem explicação, nada...
122. Tá, então, hum, puxando aqui o CLM-4492-BV agora e, ah—nossa. É, eu tô, ééé, tô vendo aqui. Negado no, hmm, dia 15. E tem—tipo, literalmente não tem anotação nenhuma? Isso, é, isso não tá certo.
Customer: Claro que não tem anotação. Por que teria...
123. Não não, hum, isso é—ééé, pera aí. Deixa eu, ah, deixa eu olhar mais a fundo aqui porque, hum, toda negativa precisa de um código, tipo DEN-alguma coisa, e a sua só tem, ah, nada. Isso não—hmm, isso nem deveria ser possível no sistema.
Customer: Hmm, e se... e se eu cancelar tudo? Quer dizer, vinte anos pagando vocês e aí...
124. Espera, espera. Não—hum, não faz isso ainda não. Eu tô, ééé, tô ficando meio, ah, puto olhando isso aqui? Sua conta ACC-2004-PL mostra, hum, histórico de pagamento perfeito, nenhuma reclamação anterior, e aí eles simplesmente, ah, negaram em branco pra você?
Customer: É, então, ah, a van tá parada há duas semanas, não consigo trabalhar, e eu tô só, sabe...
125. Certo. Tá. Não, a gente vai—hmm, a gente vai resolver isso. Hum, tô escalando pra, ah, fila de prioridade do supervisor com referência REF-URGENT-8847. Eles têm que, ééé, eles têm que responder em quatro horas.
Customer: Quatro horas. Claro. E aí o quê, outra negativa que só...
126. Hum, na verdade não? Quando entra, ah, nessa fila com REF-URGENT-8847, eles não podem—ééé, quer dizer, eles literalmente não podem negar sem, hum, sem te ligar direto e, ah, documentar tudo. O sistema não deixa.
Customer: Deixa eu ver aqui... então você tá dizendo que tem mesmo uma chance ou...?
127. Mais que—ah, mais que uma chance. Seu arquivo tá, hmm, tá limpo. Tipo, hum, o que aconteceu aqui foi, ééé, foi erro deles. Tô colocando anotações em todo lugar.
Customer: Tá, então isso significa... o quê, eu só espero?
128. Hum, por enquanto mas, ah, mas eu também tô gerando, ééé, um rastro de auditoria? Número do caso CSE-7701-AUDIT. Então mesmo se—hmm, mesmo se alguém tentar alguma coisa, tem, ah, tem registro agora da negativa em branco.
Customer: Quer dizer, se isso faz sentido, acho que eu vou só... valeu.
129. Na verdade, hum, espera—antes de você ir? Eu tô, ah, tô te mandando email de confirmação com, ééé, tudo. REF-URGENT-8847, CSE-7701-AUDIT, e meu, hum, meu ramal direto.
Customer: Ramal direto? Isso é... tá bom.
130. É, hum, ramal 4429. Se eles—ééé, se eles tentarem qualquer coisa estranha, você, ah, você me liga direto. A gente vai, hmm, a gente vai conseguir a cobertura da sua van.
Customer: Um, so I think, uh, my blender just stopped working and, er, I bought it maybe like eleven months ago? Or was it, um, thirteen? I'm sort of confused about the warranty thing.
131. Oh no. That's—I'm so sorry. Let me just—wait, let me pull up. Can you give me your order number or—actually no, email works too?
Customer: I think it's, um, probably in my emails somewhere but, uh, I don't really understand why it matters? Like, isn't it still kind of new?
132. Right right. So um, here's the thing—and I really, uh, I hate this part—the warranty on model BLX-4400 is twelve months. Seeing here your purchase date was, er, let me—September third last year. Today's October eighth. So you're at thirteen months and, uh, five days.
Customer: Wait, um, September? I thought it was maybe October or, er, November? That doesn't sound right.
133. Yeah so, ummm, I'm looking at order ORD-9923-LK71 and it's, uh, definitely September third. Trust me, I know how frustrating—I mean, my coffee maker died at thirteen months too. Right after warranty. It's like they plan it.
Customer: But it's only, um, it's probably just a month over? Maybe two? Can't you just, I don't know, sort of help anyway?
134. I really wish I could. Like, um, genuinely. The system won't—it literally won't let me process warranty claims past, uh, past the date. Shows here expired status code EXP-1021. But listen, um, there might be something else we can do.
Customer: I'm just... tired. Like what else is there even?
135. Okay so, um, between you and me? Sometimes if it's, uh, if it's this close to warranty end, I can escalate to, er, what we call a goodwill review. Case number GWR-7766-MP22. Not guaranteed but, ummm, they sometimes make exceptions. Takes maybe three days?
Customer: Three days? Um, I don't really, er, understand what that means though? Like do I send it back or, um, what happens?
136. No no. You keep it. So basically, uh, my supervisor reviews—sorry, the team reviews cases where it's like, just barely past warranty. I put notes about you being at thirteen months, loyal customer, all that.
Customer: So maybe they'll, um, sort of fix it? Or probably not? I don't really know anymore.
137. Honestly? With it being, um, just one month over? I'd say you've got a decent shot. I'm putting in my notes that, uh, "customer purchased in good faith, minimal usage past warranty period." Reference number REF-4109-XC. I mean, I had a similar case last week. Got approved.
Customer: Um, okay but like, what if they say no? Then I just, er, have a broken blender?
138. Well, ummm, if the goodwill thing doesn't—wait actually. Let me check. Yeah so even if that doesn't work, repair service code RPR-5512 shows, um, forty-nine dollars for out-of-warranty fix. Versus hundred twenty for new one. So there's that option.
Customer: I just... forty-nine dollars. Whatever. Fine.
139. Listen, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna push hard on this goodwill review. Like I'm literally typing right now that you're, er, you're considering just buying from our competitor next time. That usually—sorry, that sometimes helps. Ticket GTX-9988-LM44 submitted.
Customer: Um, I think, er, I probably should just buy a different brand anyway, right? This is sort of ridiculous that it breaks right after twelve months.
140. You know what? Off the record? I don't blame you. But um, let me at least, uh, let's see what happens with case GWR-7766-MP22 first. I put my direct extension in the notes. 4-8-1-7. If they deny it, call me back. I'll find—we'll figure something out.
Customer: Hum, oi, então tipo, eu liguei semana passada e, é, desculpa incomodar de novo...
141. Opa! Então basicamente deixa eu só, hum, puxar sua conta aqui e—pera, na verdade, deixa eu abrir a tela certa—beleza então qual seu número da conta ou, é, telefone?
Customer: Ah, hum, é tipo 555-0298, acho?
142. Perfeito perfeito, então achei você aqui, conta ACC-7734-NZ, e hum, nossa, é então tô vendo seu caso da semana passada, ticket TKT-889241, e é, entre a gente? Alguém vacilou feio aqui.
Customer: Quer dizer, tipo, eu devo estar exagerando, é só que...
143. Não não não, então ó—e tipo, tô vendo as anotações aqui—você foi informado que isso ia pro, é, suporte nível dois em 48 horas, caso ESC-4419-B, mas ficou parado aqui, o que é, hum, nada aceitável.
Customer: Então basicamente eu me sinto idiota ligando de novo, hum, só não sabia mais o que fazer.
144. De jeito nenhum.
Customer: Oi?
145. Não se sinta idiota, quer dizer, hum, você fez exatamente o que devia fazer, e tipo assim, ó o que eu vou fazer—pera, deixa eu ver—é, então hoje eu tenho acesso override que é, é, timing perfeito basicamente.
Customer: Ah, hum, não quero causar problema pra ninguém nem nada...
146. Beleza então, hum, entre a gente? Tô escalando isso agora mesmo pra, é, não só pro nível dois mas direto pro—pera não na verdade—é, nível três, caso ESC-9902-VIP, e tipo, eles vão te ligar em, hum, duas horas no máximo.
Customer: Sério? Quer dizer, é, parece muito trabalho pra, hum, pro meu probleminha...
147. Isso isso.
Customer: Então tipo, desculpa, eu tô só, é, muito envergonhado com tudo isso.
148. Escuta, hum, então basicamente o que aconteceu com você? Falha total do sistema do nosso lado, e é, tô colocando nas anotações—pera deixa eu digitar—código de prioridade PRI-8847-X, e tipo, também vou, hum, dar crédito do próximo mês de serviço, crédito CRD-2234-MM.
Customer: Hum, nossa, isso é, tipo, você não precisa fazer isso, quer dizer...
149. Não não, então ó, é, e não conta pro meu gerente mas tipo, quando eu vejo um caso que ficou no limbo que nem o seu, referência REF-6673-Q? Eu basicamente, hum, saio um pouco do script e resolvo direito.
Customer: Então, hum, eu agradeço muito, tipo, desculpa ser tão chato com isso.
150. Você não é—pera, deixa eu só—é então tá tudo certo, confirmação CON-9981-JK, e hum, sinceramente? Me liga direto se eles não entrarem em contato, só pede o ramal 4429, e tipo, vamos resolver isso de qualquer jeito.
Customer: Um, hi, I'm I'm calling about my—my contract? I need to, uh, understand what I still... what's left on it?
151. Oh! Perfect timing actually. So let me just pull up your account here and—got it! I can see your contract number CTR-9982-AL right here, and basically what I'm seeing is you've got about fourteen months remaining on your current twenty-four month agreement that started back in October of last year.
Customer: Fourteen? Wait, that's—that's not, um, I thought it was... are you sure that's right?
152. Absolutely! So, um, let me break this down because, uh, I think I see what might be confusing here. Your contract ID CTR-9982-AL shows you signed up October fifteenth, and, um, today being December twentieth means you've completed ten months, so that leaves, uh, exactly fourteen months until October fifteenth next year.
Customer: Um, okay okay, but what if I—what if I need to, uh, to get out? Like what's the... what's the word... the penalty?
153. Oh! I see what happened here—so basically your early termination fee is calculated on a sliding scale, and looking at your account reference number ACC-7766-QM, you'd be looking at three hundred fifty dollars if you cancelled today, but that drops by twenty-five dollars each month you complete.
Customer: Three fifty? That's... I just... I can't...
154. Right right, I know that sounds like a lot! But, um, here's the thing—so I'm seeing in your file that, uh, you might actually qualify for our contract buyout program? Code PRO-2234-BB shows you've been a customer for, like, almost three years total across different contracts.
Customer: Um, I don't, uh, I don't understand what that... are you sure? What does that mean exactly?
155. So basically what that means is, um, we could potentially reduce that termination fee by, uh, let me calculate this... by about forty percent! That would bring it down to, um, two hundred ten dollars instead, and that's using discount code DSC-9901-XK which I can apply right now if you want.
Customer: Two ten... that's that's better but, um, I still need to, uh, think about if I can even...
156. Got it.
Customer: Um, what about, like, what happens to my, uh, my equipment? The the router thing and, um, you know...
157. Oh excellent question! So, um, checking your equipment list under reference EQP-4455-TN, you've got our standard router-modem combo unit, and, uh, the good news is that's actually yours to keep—no return needed since you paid the equipment fee upfront when you started.
Customer: Wait I paid for it? I don't—I don't remember... um, are you sure about that?
158. Absolutely! I can see right here, transaction TXN-889234-LP from October shows a one-time equipment purchase of ninety-nine dollars, so basically that unit is completely yours whether you stay or go, which is, uh, actually pretty great because you could use it with another provider if needed.
Customer: Um, okay, so so if I stay, uh, what happens after the fourteen months? Does it just... I mean, what's next?
159. So here's where it gets interesting—your contract reference CTR-9982-AL automatically converts to month-to-month after October next year, which means, like, no more termination fees at all, and you can cancel anytime with just thirty days notice using form FRM-1100-CC.
Customer: Month to month... um, that's that's good right? But the price, uh, does the price go up or...?
160. Oh! So, um, actually your rate is locked through the contract period at fifty-nine ninety-nine, but, uh, after that—and this is where I can help—we usually see about a ten dollar increase, but if you call us maybe, like, a month before it ends, reference retention code RET-6678-MM, we can probably keep you at the same rate or maybe even lower!
Customer: Hum, oi, é... então, preciso cancelar minha academia, é... quer dizer, eu nem tenho ido há tipo—pera não, na verdade faz seis meses, ou será que são sete?
161. Ah claro! Eu posso, hum... como é que fala... providenciar esse cancelamento pro senhor hoje. Deixa eu só, é, puxar sua conta aqui. Pode me passar seu número de matrícula ou, hum, o telefone cadastrado na conta?
Customer: Meu Deus, hum, o número de matrícula? Eu não—desculpa, deixa eu ver meu email, não pera, é, usa meu telefone, é o código de área, ah, 555-0147.
162. Perfeito, perfeito! Então tô vendo aqui... hum... conta número MEM-7782-JK91. É essa, é, mostrando a assinatura FitLife Premium? Só pra ter certeza que eu tô com a... a conta certa aqui.
Customer: Sim! Meu Deus sim, hum, FitLife, é essa mesmo, eu sou enfermeiro e trabalho de noite então eu literalmente nunca—quer dizer, eu me inscrevi achando que ia antes dos meus plantões mas é, kkkk, isso nunca aconteceu.
163. Nossa, plantão noturno, isso é... deve ser exaustivo. Tá, então, hum, olhando sua conta MEM-7782-JK91, posso ver que o senhor tá no, é... como é que a gente chama... no plano de renovação automática mensal de R$ 47,99.
Customer: Quarenta e sete e noven—pera, eu achei que era trinta? Ah não pera, esse era o preço promocional, hum, Meu Deus tô tão cansado, desculpa, acabei de sair de um plantão de doze horas e não consigo nem pensar direito.
164. Não não, o senhor tá certíssimo! Começou com R$ 29,99 por três meses e depois, hum... depois foi pro preço normal. Então pra processar esse cancelamento, vou precisar, é, verificar algumas informações de segurança primeiro.
Customer: Hum, sim, claro, o que você precisar, eu só, é, eu realmente preciso cancelar isso porque fico me dizendo que vou mas aí ou tô dormindo ou no hospital ou dormindo de novo, kkkk!
165. Entendo perfeitamente! Então, hum, pode confirmar os últimos quatro dígitos do cartão cadastrado? Deve ser o que termina em... deixa eu ver aqui... começa com 4?
Customer: Ah, é, 8826? Não pera—desculpa, esse é meu débito, hum, é o cartão de crédito, então é, ah, 9034.
166. Perfeito! Bate com o que tenho aqui. Agora, hum, preciso avisar sobre nossa... nossa política de cancelamento. Tem um, é, período de aviso de trinta dias. Então sua última cobrança seria... deixa eu calcular... 15 de novembro.
Customer: Trinta dias? Hum, tá, quer dizer, tudo bem, eu não vou há meses mesmo então qual é a diferença de mais um mês, é, pagando por nada, né? Kkkk, desculpa, é que tô muito cansado mesmo.
167. Na verdade, sabe o que é? Deixa eu, hum... deixa eu ver uma coisa aqui. Como o senhor não tem, é, usado as instalações pelos nossos registros aqui—último acesso foi 12 de maio—talvez eu consiga... consiga agilizar isso.
Customer: Meu Deus sério? Isso seria, hum, isso seria incrível, quer dizer, me sinto tão culpado de desperdiçar dinheiro mas eu literalmente—terça, não pera quarta à noite eu trabalho, aí quinta, sexta, sábado, é simplesmente impossível!
168. Tá, então, hum, boa notícia! Posso processar o que a gente chama de... de cancelamento por dificuldade. Seu número de confirmação é, é, CAN-5547-XP22. Isso vai encerrar a assinatura, hum, com efeito imediato sem cobranças adicionais.
Customer: Pera, sério mesmo? Meu Deus, hum, muito obrigado, tipo você não tem ideia de quanto eu agradeço, é, tava adiando ligar há meses porque achei que ia ser aquela coisa toda complicada!
169. De nada! Tô só, hum, verificando tudo aqui de novo pra garantir que tá... tá tudo processado certinho. Sim, confirmação CAN-5547-XP22 tá tudo certo. O senhor vai receber um email em, é, 24 a 48 horas confirmando o cancelamento.
Customer: Você é literalmente o melhor, hum, sério mesmo, tipo tô muito grato, é, a maioria dos lugares torna isso tão difícil e você foi tão prestativo e compreensivo sobre toda essa coisa de plantão noturno!
170. Ah, que gentileza sua dizer isso! Tem, hum, mais alguma coisa que eu possa ajudar hoje? E só pra, é, confirmar mais uma vez—o senhor deve receber esse email de confirmação no endereço cadastrado, o que termina com @gmail.com?
Customer: Um, yeah, so I'm trying to... what's the word... tô tentando entender essas, uh, taxas de distribuição? Pra álcool. Er, cerveja artesanal especificamente.
171. Oh absolutely, um, so let me just pull up the licensing portal here and... hmm, tá, então você tá ligando sobre as taxas estaduais de distribuição ou a gente tá falando das, um, permissões de comércio interestadual?
Customer: State. Just state. Nem consigo pensar em interestadual.
172. Got it, got it, so for in-state distribution you're looking at license type ALC-2947-DS, que custa uns 1200 por ano, mas aí também tem as taxas de declaração trimestral que...
Customer: Twelve hundred. Of course. Um, e isso é só pra... er... o que isso cobre exatamente?
173. So, um, basically that gets you your distribution rights within state lines, uh, mas olha só—e eu vou, um, te poupar uma dor de cabeça aqui—você também precisa da, uh, permissão suplementar de fornecedor SVP-4421-B se você vai vender pra restaurantes e, um, isso é mais 450...
Customer: Four fifty more. Great. Perfect. Por que não, né.
174. Yeah, I know it adds up quick, mas escuta, a maioria das cervejarias não percebe que tem na verdade um pacote combinado BPC-8829-CX que junta os dois por 1400 total, economiza uns 250 por ano se você tá planejando...
Customer: Wait, there's a... um... a package? Ninguém, uh, ninguém mencionou nenhum... er... negócio de pacote.
175. Oh yeah, um, so it's not really advertised, porque, uh, sinceramente tá enterrado na subseção 12 do, um, guia de licenciamento, mas eu sempre, uh, eu sempre falo pros cervejeiros sobre isso porque, um, sabe, cada real conta quando você tá começando...
Customer: Subsection twelve. Claro que é.
176. And actually, since you're a craft brewery, você pode se qualificar pra isenção de pequeno produtor SPE-7761-A, baixa esses 1400 pra 975 se sua produção anual é menor que 15000 barris, o que eu tô assumindo...
Customer: Um, fifteen thousand? A gente tá... uh... a gente tá longe disso... er, talvez tipo... um, 2000? Se muito?
177. Oh perfect, um, so you definitely qualify then, e, uh, olha o que eu vou fazer—eu vou, um, te mandar por email o link direto pra esse formulário porque, er, o portal normal nem mostra isso a não ser que você saiba, um, procurar especificamente...
Customer: You can just... do that? Mandar o formulário certo por email?
178. Absolutely, that's why I'm here, pra ter certeza que você não desperdiça dinheiro com taxas que você não precisa pagar, e sinceramente o sistema é tão complicado que se alguém não te guiar...
Customer: Yeah, um, the last person said... er... disse que ia ajudar e aí, uh, só me mandou pra, um, página principal. Com todos os... uh... todos os formulários errados.
179. Ugh, no no no, um, that's exactly what I don't want happening, então, uh, eu tô colocando uma nota no seu arquivo agora mesmo com número de referência REF-9923-CBL e, um, eu vou ser seu contato direto então se qualquer coisa parecer estranha você só, uh, liga de volta e pede por mim especificamente...
Customer: REF-nine nine... wait. Você vai mesmo atender?
180. Yeah, ask for Jordan, extension 4782, e se eu não tiver aqui deixa uma solicitação de retorno com esse número de referência e eu vou garantir que você não pague nem um centavo a mais do que precisa, porque essas taxas já são ridículas o suficiente sem pagar a mais ainda por cima.
Customer: Eu, eu nem sei... [exhale] Eu sou só ajudante de cozinha e eles pegaram, hum, eles descontaram dinheiro pro uniforme?
181. Ah é, hum, deixa eu puxar sua conta aqui... qual é seu employee ID? E, ah, na real? Esse negócio de desconto de uniforme é, hmm, é bem ridículo se você quer saber minha opinião.
Customer: É, hum, é E4-4829. Eu só... eu comecei semana passada.
182. E4-4829, beleza então, hum, tô vendo aqui que eles te cobraram—caramba, sério mesmo?—eles te cobraram 127,50 por, ah, what looks like two aprons and some kitchen shirts? Isso é absolutamente insano, tipo, these are basically required for you to even do your job.
Customer: [sharp inhale] Cento e vinte e... eu não posso, não tenho condições disso. Isso é tipo... é a compra do mês.
183. Não não, eu entendo totalmente, hum, especially for entry-level positions where you're already not making a ton? Deixa eu, hmm, deixa eu checar uma coisa aqui no nosso banco de políticas, reference number POL-8829-XK, porque, ah, entre nós? Pode ter uma brecha.
Customer: Eu não, não sabia se eu posso mesmo, hum, reclamar disso.
184. Reclamar? Claro que você pode contestar isso! Então, hum, o negócio é o seguinte—and this is where it gets interesting—de acordo com a seção 4.7 no documento DOC-7741-RV, se você tá ganhando, er, como é que fala... at or near minimum wage, eles na verdade não podem descontar uniformes se isso te deixar abaixo do mínimo.
Customer: Espera, sério? Isso, isso existe mesmo?
185. Sim! E, hum, olhando sua taxa por hora aqui no arquivo EMP-4829-STATUS, você tá ganhando, ah, 14,50 por hora? So that deduction definitely pushed your first paycheck below minimum wage requirements, o que significa, hmm, tecnicamente eles violaram o código trabalhista LBR-2947.
Customer: Meu Deus, hum, então eu posso, posso mesmo recuperar esse dinheiro?
186. Então o que eu vou fazer—e, ah, não conta pra ninguém que eu acelerei isso—tô enviando uma solicitação prioritária de reembolso sob o número de caso CSE-9982-TM agora mesmo, e, hum, basically marking it as a compliance issue which means it goes straight to the top.
Customer: [exhale] Eu só... pera, você tá, você tá fazendo isso mesmo? Agora?
187. Já feito! O reembolso, hum, deve cair na sua conta em, hmm, deixa eu ver... processing code PRC-4451-RUSH significa, ah, 2 a 3 dias úteis no máximo, mas na real? Usually it's faster than that.
Customer: Isso é... [sharp breath] Eu achei que tava, tava preso com isso. Obrigado. Muito obrigado mesmo.
188. Escuta, hum, tem outra coisa—e eu, er, definitivamente não deveria te falar isso—mas salva esse número de confirmação CNF-8829-REFUND, porque se eles tentarem descontar por, ah, any replacement uniforms or whatever? Você pode referenciar esse caso e eles vão ter que fornecer de graça.
Customer: Tá, tá, eu tô, hum, tô anotando. CNF... 8829...
189. REFUND, isso. E, ah, na real? Esse negócio todo de fazer trabalhador iniciante pagar por uniforme obrigatório é só, hmm, é uma sacanagem total. I've been here three years and I still think it's ridiculous como eles, er, como eles tentam tirar cada centavo dos novatos.
Customer: Não acredito que você, você realmente resolveu isso. Eu tava tão, hum, tão preocupado com o aluguel e agora... [breath] obrigado.
190. Ei, todos nós já passamos por isso, sabe? E, hum, mais uma coisa—seu caso de referência CSE-9982-TM tá marcado no sistema agora, então se você tiver QUALQUER outro desconto estranho ou, ah, anything that seems off? Só ligar de volta, dar esse número pra eles, e, er, pedir direto pro time de compliance. Eles vão cuidar de você.
Customer: So um, I basically help students with this stuff all day but like, my own servicer just... won't fix it.
191. Alright, let me pull up your account here. So I need your account number if you have it, or I can look you up with social—last four digits is fine.
Customer: Um, it's like, 4-4-7-9. Basically I've called three times?
192. Got it, so, um, I'm seeing account number LRN-445779-B here and, uh, looks like you've had quite the journey with us. So basically there's a note here from October about a payment allocation issue, another from November about, hmm, incorrect interest calculation. Is that what we're dealing with today?
Customer: Yeah so um, exactly. Like, I literally do PSLF paperwork, you know? Daily.
193. Right right. So here's what I'm seeing—your PSLF certification form PSL-20240187 was submitted but, um, it's showing as incomplete in our system. Which is weird because you'd know exactly how to fill these out. Let me dig deeper here... okay so basically the issue is with employer verification code EVR-9982.
Customer: Um, but that's like, that's correct though? Are you sure?
194. Yeah so, hmm, I believe you—you definitely know this stuff. So what's happening is... okay. Your employer's EIN is showing differently in our database versus what the Department of Ed has. Transaction TXN-884521009 from your employer shows one number, but federal database shows another.
Customer: So um, we merged. Like, two years ago? Basically nobody updated it?
195. There it is. Yeah so that's, uh, that's gonna be the problem and honestly? This happens constantly. So basically your qualifying payments from the last, hmm, looks like 24 months are all in limbo status under reference number REF-445779-24M.
Customer: Um, so like, twenty-four months? That's... are you sure about that timeline?
196. Unfortunately yeah. So the thing is, once an EIN mismatch happens, every payment after that date gets flagged. I can see here in case number CSE-1198745 that all your payments are there, they're just not counting toward your 120.
Customer: But like, um, I need ten more. Just ten. So basically I'm done if those count.
197. Exactly. So, um, you're literally at 110 qualifying payments according to tracker ID TRK-556210-PSLF, and with these 24 in limbo, you'd be at 134. You'd have been forgiven over a year ago.
Customer: Um, so like, what about my job though? If they find out I can't manage my own loans...
198. Right right, I get it. So here's what I can do—and, uh, I wish I could just override this but—I can escalate this to our PSLF specialist team. Case number will be ESC-778904-P. They have authority to manually reconcile EIN mismatches but, and here's the frustrating part, current processing time is showing 45 to 60 business days.
Customer: So basically like, three months? Um, that's... I mean, are you sure there's no faster way?
199. Honestly? I'm looking for any workaround here because, uh, you clearly know what you're doing. So there is one thing—document request DRQ-445779-A. If you can get your HR to submit an official EIN change letter on letterhead, referencing both old and new numbers, I can attach it directly to escalation ESC-778904-P. Sometimes that cuts it down to like, 15 business days.
Customer: Um, yeah, so like, I can do that. Today. Will that really work though?
200. So basically, um, I've seen it work about, hmm, 80% of the time? I'm adding priority flag PRI-445779 to your account right now. Just email that letter to escalations at our domain, reference both your case ESC-778904-P and account LRN-445779-B, and, uh, honestly? Given you know this system inside out, you've probably got better odds than most. I really wish I could just fix it right now.
Customer: Então basicamente é, eu recebi essa reclamação? Tipo, é, alguém tá dizendo que eu quebrei o, é, o piano deles ou sei lá?
201. Nossa, eu consigo, é, entender totalmente como isso deve ser frustrante. Deixa eu só, é, puxar sua conta aqui... okay so I'm seeing claim number CLM-9847-DX, filed against your company ID MOV-4429-TK, e é, sim, é sobre um transporte de piano da terça passada?
Customer: Terça. Certo. Então tipo, é, aquele trabalho foi, é, it was a nightmare already.
202. Eu te entendo, de verdade. É, essas reclamações de dano são simplesmente, é, são muito estressantes pra todo mundo envolvido, e tipo, especially when you're already dealing with, é, você sabe, mudanças difíceis. Então o valor da reclamação listado aqui tá, é, mostrando como 3.200 dólares contra a apólice POL-7768-MV?
Customer: Três mil— pera. O quê? Isso é insano.
203. É, isso é... é, realmente parece muito alto. So let me, é, investigar os detalhes aqui porque, é, talvez tenha alguma coisa que a gente pode, você sabe, trabalhar?
Customer: Quer dizer tipo, é, o negócio é? Eu não. Quebrei. Nada. Então.
204. Certo, certo. Absolutamente. É, então olhando a documentação que eles enviaram sob referência DOC-5512-QP, eles tão, é, alegando que tem dano estrutural na caixa de ressonância? E é, I'm seeing photos attached to file IMG-8823-A through IMG-8823-F, mas honestamente, é, algumas dessas parecem bem inconclusivas?
Customer: Posso só, é, tipo te contar o que realmente, é, o que aconteceu de verdade lá?
205. Por favor! É, acho que isso seria, é, really helpful actually. E só pra você saber, eu tô, é, gravando esses detalhes no relatório de incidente INC-2904-TL pra gente ter o seu lado documentado direitinho?
Customer: Então basicamente. É. Eles me fizeram. É. Esperar do lado de fora. Por tipo, é, duas horas?
206. Nossa, é, duas horas? Isso é... é, caramba. So you were just, tipo, sentado lá com o piano deles e, é, ninguém te deixava entrar?
Customer: Na chuva! Sim! E aí de repente a culpa é minha?
207. Pera, tava chovendo? É, okay this is, é, isso é realmente muito importante porque... hmm, deixa eu checar o formulário de reclamação CLM-9847-DX deles de novo... they didn't mention weather conditions at all, o que é, é, tipo uma omissão bem significativa?
Customer: Sabe de uma coisa? É, eu na verdade, é, eu tirei fotos também. De tipo, é, eu esperando?
208. Ah perfeito! Sim! É, definitivamente envia essas através do nosso portal na referência RFL-6690-WK porque, é, that could really help your case here. Quer dizer, se tinha questão de clima e eles te deixaram esperando, isso é... isso muda as coisas?
Customer: Isso vai... afetar meu seguro? Eu não posso. I just can't deal with that.
209. Então, é, aqui vai o que eu posso te dizer. É, since this is your first claim in, deixa eu ver... é, três anos na conta ACC-4429-TK, você ainda tá em, é, situação regular? E honestamente, é, com a informação que você tá me dando, acho que a gente tem bases sólidas pra contestar?
Customer: Você parece que realmente entende. Obrigado. Sério mesmo.
210. Claro! Quer dizer, é, I used to work dispatch for a moving company actually, então eu já, é, vi como algumas dessas reclamações podem ser injustas? Seu número de caso é CSE-1105-RB e eu vou pessoalmente sinalizar isso pra revisão porque, é, definitivamente tem alguma coisa estranha aqui.
Customer: Acabei de ser cobrado. De novo. Por uma coisa que eu—peraí, fui eu que contratei isso?
211. Oi, tudo bem? Então, é... deixa eu só... puxar sua conta aqui. Que cobrança você tá, é, vendo exatamente? Às vezes essas coisas, tipo, meio que passam batido, sabe?
Customer: É, é do, é... FitTracker Pro? 49,99. Eu nem—faz meses que não uso isso.
212. Ah cara. FitTracker. É, então, hum, eu na verdade—isso é meio constrangedor—mas eu tenho tipo três assinaturas que esqueci que tinha. Deixa eu... tá. Número da conta ACC-7829-MX22. Você contratou isso, é, parece que foi dia 3 de janeiro?
Customer: Janeiro?! Isso é... nove meses de—não peraí, dez—dez meses!
213. Isso isso. Então basicamente o que acontece é, hum, promessas de ano novo, sabe? E aí tipo... a vida acontece. Tô vendo que seu último login foi, é, 28 de janeiro. Praticamente, é, padrão clássico aqui.
Customer: É, então você pode só, é, cancelar? Tipo agora? Hoje?
214. Com certeza. Feito. Já tá processando. Seu código de cancelamento é CAN-9847-ZF91. Mas, hum, olha só—e eu provavelmente não deveria te falar isso—mas a gente consegue na verdade, é, dar crédito retroativo pelos meses não usados?
Customer: Peraí, sério? Vocês conseguem fazer isso?
215. Então tecnicamente. O sistema mostra, hum, zero atividade desde janeiro. O que significa, tipo, que eu posso marcar isso como "serviço não utilizado" sob a referência REF-4421-QT. Você receberia... deixa eu calcular... 449 reais de volta.
Customer: É, isso é—nossa, eu não achei que você—tem certeza que pode fazer isso?
216. Olha. Entre a gente? Eu, é, trabalho aqui há seis anos. A empresa prefere, hum, manter você satisfeito do que te perder pra sempre. A transação TXN-88273-KL tá processando. Deve cair no seu cartão em, tipo, três a cinco dias.
Customer: Isso é, hum... tô sinceramente chocado. Eu liguei pronto pra só—pra desistir, sabe?
217. Ah não, eu entendo. Pode crer. Descobri mês passado que eu tava pagando, é, um app de meditação desde 2019? 20 reais por mês. Nunca nem, é, baixei o negócio. Simplesmente... esqueci. Essas coisas acontecem, sabe? Bem mais do que você imagina.
Customer: Ha! Tá bom, isso... isso me faz sentir menos idiota na verdade.
218. Não é idiota de jeito nenhum. Sério. Eu processo talvez, hum, uns quinze desses por dia? Sua confirmação de reembolso é RFD-6652-YN94. E olha, é, dica de ouro? Confere seu extrato bancário procurando qualquer coisa terminando em 99. Geralmente são assinaturas esquecidas.
Customer: É, é, eu provavelmente deveria, é... deveria fazer isso. Tipo hoje.
219. Boa ideia. E também só... coloca lembretes? É o que eu faço agora. Enfim, hum, mais alguma coisa? O cancelamento tá feito. Reembolso processando. Você tá resolvido aqui.
Customer: Não, é só—peraí, na verdade, é, vou receber um email ou algo assim?
220. Ah sim sim. Já foi enviado. Confere sua caixa de entrada. Confirmação EML-3998-WT22. Tem todos os detalhes. Data do cancelamento. Valor do reembolso. Tudo. E, é, sinceramente? Obrigado por ser de boa com isso.
Customer: Hi, look, I know you're prob'bly busy but I need help with discounts.
221. Oh no worries at all! So basically I can definitely help you with that—let me just pull up our discount programs here in system DIS-9847-QR.
Customer: Thanks for bein' patient. Just need to know 'bout student or senior rates.
222. Absolutely! So we have both actually—the student discount is 15% off with valid ID, and basically senior discount starts at age 65, that's 20% off.
Customer: That's great. How'd I know this is legit though? Not some bait thing?
223. Oh totally understand! So basically all our discounts are registered under policy POL-2024-VK3, and like, you can verify that on our website's terms page.
Customer: Mm. What proof you need? For for the senior one.
224. Right, so for seniors we just need a government-issued ID showing birthdate—driver's license works perfectly. Upload it to portal SEC-7739-BD and basically it processes instantly.
Customer: How do I know my ID's safe with you? Data breaches ev'rywhere now.
225. That's such a valid concern! So like, our verification system VER-8821-PX uses bank-level encryption, and basically we delete the image after verification—never stored.
Customer: Okay okay. Look, not your fault if it's complicated. Just cautious.
226. No, I really appreciate that! So basically being careful is smart—let me walk you through exactly how it works, step by step, okay?
Customer: Sure. You seem straight with me. What's first?
227. Perfect! So first, you'd go to account settings, then click "Apply Discount"—that generates request number REQ-6632-AA—and basically from there it guides you through uploading.
Customer: Wait. Why's it need a request number? Seems like trackin' me.
228. Oh that's just for your protection actually! So like, the number REQ-6632-AA lets you check status anytime, and basically if anything goes wrong, we can fix it faster.
Customer: Hm. S'pose that makes sense. Know you're just doin' your job here.
229. Thanks for understanding! So once approved—usually takes like five minutes—you'll get confirmation code starting with CNF, and basically the discount applies to everything automatically.
Customer: Good. One more thing—this retroactive? Got an order last week.
230. So unfortunately discounts only apply going forward, but like—let me check something. Your recent order ORD-9981-TM? Basically I can issue a courtesy credit for the difference, just this once.
Customer: Então, tô ligando sobre... como é que fala... meu pagamento? Tá, hum, meio errado de novo.
231. Ah! Hum, tá bom então deixa eu só, é, puxar sua conta aqui e, hmm, vou precisar do seu ID de funcionário pra, é, pra começar—péra aí—você tem aí com você?
Customer: Tenho sim, é, é... acho que é 4827. Ou talvez 4287? Tô muito cansado mesmo.
232. Beleza então, hum, tenho aqui o ID de funcionário 4827 e, é, ah! Tô vendo seu arquivo agora—conta de folha de pagamento PAY-4827-NRS—e hmm, então basicamente o que tô vendo é, hum, tem algo errado mesmo com seus últimos dois períodos de pagamento, né?
Customer: Claro que tem. Porque né, por que alguma coisa ia... funcionar direito.
233. Não não, hum, a gente vai resolver isso com certeza! Então, é, olhando a transação TXN-892244-Q, tá mostrando que, hum, suas horas extras do—péra deixa eu ver aqui—do dia 15 até o 28? Elas tão, é, tão codificadas errado no sistema.
Customer: Eu trabalhei, tipo, praticamente três turnos duplos nessa semana? Então... é.
234. Nossa, hum, três turnos duplos! Tá então, é, é exatamente isso que tô vendo aqui mas, hmm, alguém registrou como horas normais no código REG-1122 ao invés de, hum, ao invés do código de hora extra OVT-1122, que é, é, uma diferença enorme no pagamento!
Customer: É meio que... quer dizer, eu já liguei sobre isso antes? Umas duas vezes provavelmente?
235. Entendi, entendi.
Customer: E eles disseram que ia ser, é, "resolvido no próximo ciclo" ou algo assim. Mas aqui estamos.
236. Tá então, hum, tô olhando seu histórico de casos—números de caso CAS-7761-A e, é, CAS-8892-A—e hmm, você tá certíssimo, essa é, hum, essa é a terceira vez! Então basicamente o que vou fazer é, é, escalar isso direto pra gerência da folha de pagamento com prioridade PRI-URGENT-01.
Customer: Eu só... tô tão cansado. Tipo, hum, dá pra realmente resolver dessa vez?
237. Sim! Hum, com certeza sim! Então, é, olha o que tá acontecendo agora—tô, hum, tô calculando a diferença e, hmm, parece que você tem a receber, é, deixa eu ter certeza que tá certo—R$ 1.847,23 sob o código de ajuste ADJ-9984-OT.
Customer: Pera, isso é, hum... é mais do que eu pensava? Talvez?
238. Ah! Então, hum, é porque, é, tô vendo que eles também não colocaram seu adicional de turno! Então basicamente, hum, noites e fins de semana deveriam estar codificados como DIF-445 e, é, não tavam aplicando isso também, o que é, hmm, completamente errado.
Customer: Então tipo, quando eu realmente... sabe... recebo?
239. Certo certo, então, hum, tô enviando isso como solicitação de pagamento emergencial EPR-3345-X agora mesmo e, é, basicamente o que isso significa é, hmm, você deve ver na sua conta em, hum, 48 a 72 horas no máximo ao invés de esperar o próximo ciclo regular.
Customer: Quer dizer, acho que é... é alguma coisa. Se realmente acontecer dessa vez.
240. Não não, hum, vai acontecer com certeza! Então, é, tô te dando o número de confirmação CNF-88234-NRS e, hum, tô marcando isso pessoalmente no meu sistema pra, é, pra acompanhar na quinta—e hmm, se por algum motivo não processar, que vai processar, mas só por garantia, hum, você pode usar esse número de referência e a gente acelera ainda mais.
Customer: Hum, oi. Tô ligando sobre—pera, não. As taxas de licença? Acho que aumentaram?
241. Ah, é, então basicamente deixa eu, é, puxar sua conta aqui rapidinho. Posso pegar seu, hum, ID de fornecedor ou número da licença?
Customer: VL-4492. Ninguém avisou a gente. Você tem certeza que tá certo isso?
242. Então, é, VL-4492, entendi, e ah, sim, tô vendo o, hum, o aumento aqui no seu aviso de renovação REN-7734-BX e, hmm, sinceramente? Eles provavelmente deviam ter mandado alguma coisa.
Customer: Provavelmente? Que... ótimo. Comunicação maravilhosa essa aí.
243. É, eu sei, é, hum, meio ridículo mesmo, na real. Então basicamente o que aconteceu é, ah, o município aumentou todas as, hum, taxas de serviço de alimentação lá em, é, outubro? Mas as notificações da conta FEE-4492-Q saíram, tipo, super atrasadas.
Customer: Outubro? Já é—não pera—já é dezembro. Dois meses?
244. É, exatamente. Dois meses. É, ah, bem ruim mesmo.
Customer: Então o que eu, hum, deveria fazer? O orçamento já tá pronto. Talvez a gente não consiga—sei lá.
245. Tá, então, é, deixa eu só, hum, ver quais opções a gente tem aqui. Sua renovação REN-7734-BX mostra, ah, um aumento de, hmm, trinta e dois por cento? Que é, hum, é pesado mesmo.
Customer: Trinta e dois? Você tá—pera, tem certeza? Não pode tá certo isso.
246. Hum, infelizmente sim, tá, é, mostrando trinta e dois por cento na fatura INV-889241-K. Mas, então basicamente, pode ter, hum, um prazo de carência que a gente pode trabalhar?
Customer: Prazo de carência. Tá. Quanto tempo, quer dizer, provavelmente não é suficiente?
247. Então, ah, olhando seu histórico de conta no código de sistema SYS-4492-VL, você tá, hum, com a gente há, é, doze anos? Então acho que consigo provavelmente, hum, te dar tipo uns sessenta dias?
Customer: Sessenta dias pra quê—achar dinheiro? Isso não é—desculpa. Tô preocupado mesmo.
248. Não não, eu, hum, super entendo. É, ah, estressante mesmo. Deixa eu, é, também verificar se tem alguma, hmm, isenção ou crédito pela política POL-7756-C que pode ajudar?
Customer: Hum, talvez? Acho que somos sem fins lucrativos. Mais ou menos. O estádio é da prefeitura mas a gente é... complicado.
249. Ah! Hum, tá então se vocês são, é, parcialmente sem fins lucrativos isso é, ah, isso é bom na verdade. O documento DOC-4492-NP mostra, hum, que pode ter uma, é, taxa reduzida? Tipo, hmm, talvez quinze por cento no lugar?
Customer: Quinze? Não trinta e dois? Por que não—deixa pra lá. Mas você tem certeza mesmo?
250. Hum, bem certeza, sim. Então basicamente vou, ah, marcar isso pra revisão com o número de caso CSE-991204-R e, é, alguém do licenciamento vai te ligar, provavelmente amanhã? Vai, hum, vai ficar tudo bem.
Customer: Hum, oi, é, não sei se liguei pro lugar certo? Então tipo, eu tenho essa coisa e, hum, já faz uns três dias e eu só...
251. Então basicamente eu posso, é, com certeza te ajudar com isso. Deixa eu só, hum, puxar sua conta aqui. Posso pegar seu, é, seu número de pedido ou email?
Customer: Ah! Certo. Hum. O email é... pera, você precisa do pedido? Eu não... quer dizer, é, foram tipo cinco pedidos? E hum...
252. Não—não tem problema, só o email tá ótimo. A gente consegue ver todos os seus pedidos por ele.
Customer: É, hum, jsmith arroba... não, pera, esse é o antigo... desculpa, é, é jaybird22 arroba gmail e, hum, basicamente o negócio é que meu pacote? Diz que foi entregue mas...
253. Então eu tô, é, vendo a conta ACC-7749-JB aqui, e hum, parece que você tem o pedido ORD-9621-KX que mostra entregue terça?
Customer: Isso! Mas não tá... quer dizer, eu procurei em todo lugar? Até perguntei pros meus vizinhos, os esquisitos, e hum... desculpa, isso não é relevante mas tipo...
254. Não não, isso é, hum, muito útil saber que você verificou. Então basicamente eu posso ver que o, é, o rastreamento mostra TRK-886431-Q entregue na porta da frente às 14h47.
Customer: Mas é isso! Hum, eu trabalho de casa? Eu tava aqui! E é, minha câmera da campainha não... não tem vídeo e eu só...
255. Hmm, então isso é, é, definitivamente preocupante. Deixa eu só, hum, verificar com nosso parceiro de entrega aqui. Número de referência REF-5528-PLM mostra... tá tá então pode ter um problema.
Customer: Tá... hum, tá perdido? Porque, é, na verdade é pra minha mãe? Ela tá doente e...
256. Então eu realmente, realmente queria ter, hum, notícias melhores aqui mas o GPS pin GPS-4419-X mostra entrega num endereço diferente. Não—não muito longe mas, é, rua errada.
Customer: Ai meu Deus. Hum. Você pode... quer dizer, o que eu faço? É o porta-remédios dela, aquele chique que apita? E ela fica esquecendo...
257. Certo então, hum, o que eu posso fazer—e eu, é, sinto muito mesmo que isso aconteceu—número de reclamação CLM-7765-RT tá sendo aberto agora mesmo.
Customer: Mas ela precisa tipo, hum, essa semana? Eu vou viajar e é... desculpa, é que eu tô muito estressado com essa coisa toda...
258. Não eu—eu entendo totalmente. Então basicamente, hum, eu tô marcando isso como médico prioritário, código MED-9921, o que significa, é, reposição acelerada mas...
Customer: Mas o quê? Hum, por favor, eu só... não sei mais o que fazer aqui e tô meio surtando...
259. Então o negócio é que, hum, mesmo com prioridade é, é, ainda são três dias úteis. Eu queria poder—quer dizer, se eu pudesse mandar pra chegar amanhã eu mandaria mas o sistema não...
Customer: Três dias. Tá. Hum. Isso é... eu viajo quinta então é... mal dá tempo se...
260. É então, hum, o rastreamento da reposição vai ser TRK-3382-NW e, é, eu tô colocando todas as sinalizações possíveis nisso. Entrega terça, garantida, e eu vou, hum, monitorar pessoalmente.
Customer: Of course there's charges. Um... three hundred at some casino I've never...
261. Oh no, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's happening. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out, okay? Everything's going to be fine.
Customer: Yeah. Sure it will.
262. So I'm, um, looking at your account ending in 4782 and I can see... oh yes, there's, uh, definitely some unusual activity here. Let me just, um, make some notes in case number CSE-9914-TX so we can track everything properly.
Customer: Three charges. Um, all yesterday when I was, uh... literally at work.
263. Right, right.
Customer: So that's fun. Really great security you guys...
264. I know this is, um, really frustrating and I'm so sorry this happened to you. But here's the good news—we're going to, uh, reverse all these charges immediately. Transaction IDs TXN-88512-A, TXN-88513-A, and, um, TXN-88514-A are all getting flagged for full reversal.
Customer: Um, wait, really? That's... huh. That was easier than I thought.
265. So, um, between you and me? The system already, uh, flagged these as suspicious before you even called. We were just... waiting to confirm with you. Your new card, um, reference number CRD-6627-NEW, ships overnight.
Customer: Overnight? You guys actually, uh... that's kinda nice.
266. Absolutely.
Customer: So, um, do I need to like, file a police report or...
267. Nope! We'll, um, handle everything on our end. Your fraud claim number is FRD-10923-APPROVED and it's, uh, already approved actually. The money should be back in... hmm, let me check... within 24 hours.
Customer: This is weird. Um, nothing ever goes this smooth for me. There's gotta be...
268. I mean, um, I totally get why you'd think that but, uh, honestly? Sometimes things just... work out. Your account's protected under policy POL-8829-GOLD which means, um, zero liability for you.
Customer: Huh. Well. Thanks. You're, uh... you're actually pretty good at this.
269. Um, okay so, uh, here's something I don't usually tell people but... if you download our app and, um, turn on instant alerts under settings code SET-NOTIFY-MAX? You'll know, like, the second anything happens.
Customer: Oh that's... yeah, I'll do that. Um, thanks for being, you know... human about this.
270. Of course! So just to, um, recap everything—your case number is CSE-9914-TX, all three transactions are being reversed, and, uh, your new card ships tonight with tracking TRK-5542-OVERNIGHT. Is there, um, anything else I can help with today?
Customer: Um, I've been—I've been on hold for forty minutes and, uh, transferred twice already, okay?
271. Oh! So, um, like, I can absolutely see what happened here. Let me just, uh, pull up your account and—okay so basically your reference number REF-4492-NL88 shows, um, multiple transfers and that's... that's not right. At all.
Customer: I'm a locksmith, I—wait no—I run a locksmith business and, um, I really need this resolved.
272. Got it. Got it.
Customer: My van broke down and, uh, the insurance claim, it's it's been pending for, um, three weeks now?
273. Okay so, um, I'm seeing claim number CLM-7739-XK here and, like, this is actually really interesting because, uh, there's a note that says—oh! Wait. I think I found the problem. So basically what happened was, um, the system flagged it as commercial but then, uh, processed it as personal?
Customer: Are you—are you sure you can fix this? Because, um, I've got customers waiting and I just—I just can't keep canceling jobs.
274. Absolutely yes! So, um, like, here's what I'm gonna do. Your policy number POL-885544-TY shows you have, uh, commercial coverage and basically I'm updating the claim right now. Like, literally as we speak.
Customer: Um, my wife's pregnant and we—we really need the income, you know? I can't—sorry, I mean, we can't afford this delay.
275. Oh wow. Okay. So, um, let me just, uh, escalate this differently then.
Customer: Wait, escalate? No no no, please don't transfer me again!
276. No! No no. So, um, I'm not transferring you anywhere, like, I'm actually just, uh, changing your priority code to PRI-URGENT-2A which basically means, um, your claim gets reviewed within 24 hours instead of the standard, uh, five to seven business days.
Customer: Um, really? You can—you can do that?
277. So like, um, technically I need manager approval but, uh, given your situation and the fact that you've been, um, bounced around for forty minutes? Yeah. I'm just. Doing it. Your new reference is REF-4492-NL88-PRIORITY.
Customer: I just—I just need to know it'll actually happen this time, okay okay?
278. Right right.
Customer: Because last Tuesday—wait no, Thursday—Thursday they said the same thing and, um, nothing happened.
279. Okay so, um, here's the difference. Like, what they did was just, uh, add a note to your file but, um, what I'm doing is actually changing your claim status to, uh, expedited review with tracking number TRK-9983-XM44. So basically you'll get, um, text updates every step.
Customer: Um, you're—you're sure about the twenty-four hours? My mortgage is due and, uh, I'm already behind.
280. Yes! So, um, like, I'm putting my employee ID EMP-7745 directly on this and, uh, basically if it doesn't process by tomorrow at, um, 3 PM your time? You call back. Ask for me. Sarah. And I will, like, personally walk this through myself.
Customer: Hum, então tipo, por que exatamente eu preciso, é... dezessete formulários diferentes pra uma reclamação de garantia?
281. Tá, então, hmm, deixa eu ver aqui... Tô olhando sua reclamação WRT-4429-XK e, é, eu acho—pera, dezessete? Isso não—quer dizer, isso definitivamente não tá certo.
Customer: Viu? É isso—eu sabia. Vocês simplesmente não querem pagar.
282. Não não não. A gente vai resolver isso. Hum, então basicamente o que tô vendo aqui é, ah, alguém marcou sua reclamação como comercial em vez de pessoal, o que aciona toda essa, hum, documentação desnecessária sob o código de política POL-8837-C, mas isso é—isso tá errado.
Customer: Como é que eu sei que você não tá, hum, inventando isso só pra me tirar do telefone?
283. Porque eu vou, hmm, passar por cima disso tudo. Deixa eu só—tá, então eu preciso, é, escalar isso mas, hum, entre a gente? Sua certificação de mecânico MCH-1922-A na verdade te dá status prioritário que ninguém, é, ninguém sinalizou direito.
Customer: Pera, sério? Eu tenho—o que é status prioritário?
284. Então basicamente, hum, mecânicos profissionais têm processamento acelerado sob o código EXP-7734-M, o que significa, é, você deveria ter precisado de, hmm, três formulários no máximo? Alguém realmente, hum, realmente ferrou com isso.
Customer: Hum, tá mas tipo, eu já gastei quatro horas nessa papelada, então...
285. Certo, certo. Entendo totalmente. Então o que eu vou fazer—e eu provavelmente não deveria te contar isso—mas tem um, hum, protocolo de compensação CMP-9901-X pra erros de documentação acima de, é, acima de duas horas. Você vai receber um crédito.
Customer: Pera pera pera, você tá realmente—não pera, você tá falando sério agora?
286. Muito sério. Hum, então tipo, tô processando, é, deixa eu ver... um crédito de serviço de R$ 200 sob a referência SVC-4421-B, e eu tô, hum, tô acelerando sua reclamação original.
Customer: Eu não—hum, quer dizer, eu não esperava... Isso tá acontecendo mesmo?
287. Ah, tá acontecendo. Seu novo número de reclamação é, hum, deixa eu só... WRT-4430-XP, esse P significa prioritário, e, é, você vai ter aprovação em, hmm, vinte e quatro horas. Talvez menos.
Customer: Então tipo, toda aquela papelada que eu fiz, é, eu posso jogar fora?
288. Pode. Rasga. Hum, na verdade, pera—guarda a página um com a referência REF-3318-K por via das dúvidas, mas, é, todo o resto? É. Lixo.
Customer: Isso é, hum... cara. Eu liguei pronto pra cancelar tudo e agora você tá tipo, realmente resolvendo?
289. Esse é o trabalho. Bom, hmm, tecnicamente meu trabalho é seguir o protocolo mas, hum, às vezes o protocolo é, ah, meio idiota, sabe? Sua garantia é válida, reclamação aprovada, e, hum, sinceramente? Como mecânico você nunca deveria ter passado por isso.
Customer: Hum, sério mesmo, tipo, obrigado. Isso é... é. Valeu.
290. Sem problema. Ah e, hum, se alguém perguntar? Você só enviou, é, os três formulários padrão. O resto foi um, hmm, um erro do sistema no ticket TKT-5567-Z. Tá beleza?
Customer: Ahn, então eu sou cliente há—pera, não, 8 anos—9 anos, e ahn, isso é simplesmente, é, completamente inaceitável.
291. Tá bom. Deixa eu, ahn, puxar sua conta aqui e, é, hmm, qual é o número do pedido? I can probably track down what happened with your... o que era mesmo, um pedido de presente?
Customer: Era pra ser—não, desculpa, ERA um presente surpresa de aniversário e ahn, chegou completamente destruído!
292. Ah. Certo. Então, ahn, deixa eu ver aqui... acho que achei, pedido GFT-4429-BX12? E é, você tá dizendo que chegou, ahn, tipo... qual é a palavra... comprometido? Danificado?
Customer: Comprometido? Ahn, isso é—nossa, that's a nice way to put it, quando minha sogra abriu uma caixa de, é, vidro quebrado!
293. Hmm, tá então, ahn, puxando o rastreamento aqui, TRK-889541-QV, e é, sim, I can see there was maybe a handling issue? Deixa eu só, é, checar as notas do armazém rapidinho.
Customer: Um problema de manuseio. Certo. Ahn, então depois de 9 anos de—pera, de ser fiel, é isso, é, é isso que eu recebo?
294. Eu entendo. Sério mesmo. Ahn, então olhando seu histórico de conta, ID do cliente CST-00847-ML, você está conosco desde, é, 2015? Isso é... pois é. Hmm. Tá, deixa eu, ahn, ver o que eu posso fazer aqui.
Customer: Ahn, você pode só, é, explicar como isso—não, desculpa, POR QUE isso aconteceu?
295. Certo, então, ahn, checando o relatório de incidente, número de referência INC-7745-PQ09, it looks like the carrier marked it as "mishandled in transit"? Que é tipo a forma deles de, ahn, dizer que provavelmente derrubaram. Maybe threw it. Quer dizer, é, manusearam com força.
Customer: Ah fantástico. Então ahn, eles simplesmente—desculpa, they threw my crystal anniversary gift? Meu presente de CRISTAL?
296. Cristal. Ah! Ah não. Ahn, isso é... pois é. Deixa eu, é, hmm, puxar nosso sistema de resolução prioritária aqui, número do caso PRI-9982-XM44, because this is definitely not okay. Acho que a gente pode provavelmente, é, acelerar uma reposição?
Customer: Ahn, uma reposição não conserta—quer dizer, ela já VIU, a surpresa tá, é, completamente arruinada!
297. Você tá certo. Totalmente certo. Então, ahn, deixa eu pensar aqui... hmm, what if we do something extra? Seu pedido de reposição, RPL-6621-TT08, I can overnight it, e talvez, ahn, adicionar um tipo de... crédito de desculpas?
Customer: Ahn, eu não—pera, quanto que a gente tá falando, porque é, isso era pra ser especial.
298. Tá então, é, estou colocando, hmm, deixa eu ver o que eu posso... ahn, código de autorização AUTH-3847-QQ91... I can do the full refund PLUS the replacement? Isso é tipo, ahn, não é padrão mas considerando a, você sabe, a situação...
Customer: Pera, ahn, os dois? Você tá—não desculpa, you're giving me both the refund AND sending a new one?
299. Sim! Sim, então ahn, confirmação RFD-2298-LK55 pro reembolso, e é, o novo sai hoje à noite. Ah! E, ahn, estou adicionando um, hmm, upgrade de embalagem premium pra presente? Código GFT-PREM-8891? Pra fazer, é, sabe, extra especial dessa vez.
Customer: Ahn, isso é na verdade—nossa, I wasn't expecting... é, obrigado, isso é, ahn, isso ajuda.
300. Ótimo! Ahn, então tudo pronto, seu número de caso pra referência é, é, FNL-0156-PP42, e hmm, I've put notes that if anything goes wrong, eles devem provavelmente, é, escalar direto pra gerência. We'll get this right.
Customer: Então, basicamente eu trabalho na CVS mesmo e minha entrega de insulina era pra ter chegado terça passada, and I know how this works but I really need this.
301. Nossa! Ah, meu Deus, tá bom então, deixa eu só—hmm—puxar sua conta aqui e, tipo, eu tô muito afim de te ajudar com isso, especially since you're in the field yourself, então, er, posso pegar seu número de ID de membro?
Customer: Claro, é tipo 558823091, and I get that delays happen but I'm literally rationing doses at this point.
302. Tá bom então, consegui sua conta aqui, membro 558823091, e nossa, tô vendo—hmm—sua prescrição RX-7739-MED era, tipo, definitivamente pra ter chegado no dia 15, e tô checando o rastreamento agora, deixa eu só atualizar esse sistema porque às vezes ele não atualiza direito.
Customer: Cara, eu já chequei o rastreamento umas 20 vezes e só fica dizendo "em trânsito" há uma semana inteira, which we both know means it's lost.
303. É, então, você tá absolutamente certo sobre isso, e honestamente entre nós—hmm—quando fica "em trânsito" por mais de 3 dias? That usually means it's probably sitting in some warehouse somewhere, o que é realmente inaceitável, especialmente pra insulina.
Customer: Exatamente, e tipo, eu tô dizendo pros meus próprios pacientes que os remédios deles vão chegar no prazo enquanto o meu tá flutuando por aí, and I know this isn't your fault but this is literally life or death medication.
304. Não não não, você tá completamente certo de estar chateado, e tipo, isso é genuinamente inaceitável, então o que eu vou fazer agora mesmo é colocar uma liberação de emergência com código EMG-9982-STAT pra conseguir pra você entrega overnight da nossa rede de farmácias prioritárias.
Customer: Espera, sério? Então—deixa eu entender—eles realmente conseguem mandar insulina overnight? Because I thought there were temperature control issues with shipping.
305. Sim! Então, a gente tem esse serviço especial refrigerado expresso que, honestly costs us a fortune, mas pra situações assim onde é medicação crítica e houve atraso da nossa parte? The system should auto-approve it, e eu tô colocando a liberação agora sob referência OVR-4421-X.
Customer: Meu Deus, obrigado, então basicamente quando chegaria? Because I literally have maybe two days left if I keep stretching it.
306. Então, se eu enviar isso agora—e eu tô literalmente fazendo enquanto a gente conversa—hmm—você vai receber até as 10:30 da manhã amanhã, and I'm also seeing here that we can credit your account, o custo total desse envio mais um crédito adicional de serviço de $50 com código CRD-7765-APL.
Customer: Cara, isso é incrível e tipo, eu realmente agradeço você fazer alguma coisa de verdade instead of just apologizing over and over.
307. Ah! Bem, quer dizer, eu ainda sou meio novo aqui mas tipo, eu só penso como se fosse minha mãe, sabe? And the confirmation for your overnight is CNF-8823-RUSH, e você deve receber um SMS em uns 5 minutos com o rastreamento.
Customer: Então basicamente você é a primeira pessoa que realmente ajudou, and I work retail pharmacy so I know how awful customers can be, e desculpa se eu pareci frustrado.
308. Não não não, por favor não se desculpe! Tipo, você tá sendo tão compreensivo e, honestly? Most people would be screaming at me by now if their insulin was a week late, e eu realmente respeito que você tá ficando tão calmo mesmo sendo literalmente sobre sua saúde.
Customer: É, bem, quer dizer, a gente tá só tentando fazer nosso trabalho, né? And this whole system is broken anyway, mas pelo menos você tá consertando.
309. Exatamente! E entre você e eu? Our shipping system has been kind of a mess lately—hmm—tem tido tantos atrasos e eles continuam dizendo que vai melhorar, but I've been here three months and it's actually gotten worse, então eu sempre tento dar upgrade pra overnight quando posso.
Customer: Espera, então tipo, posso ligar e pedir especificamente por você na próxima vez? Because you actually get it.
310. Ah! Que gentil! Então, tecnicamente a gente não tem linhas diretas mas se você precisar de alguma coisa, reference this case number CSE-9901-MKT, e menciona que a Agente Sarah te ajudou com o overnight de emergência, and hopefully you'll never need to call again, mas o sistema deve marcar pra atendimento prioritário.
Customer: É, então, tô ligando sobre meu, ah, pagamento que tá atrasado. De novo.
311. Tá, deixa eu só... hmm, puxar sua conta aqui... Desculpa, tá uma manhã bem corrida e eu tô só... qual era seu código de local ou, é, seu número de ID de anfitrião? Consigo te achar por aí e ver o que tá...
Customer: Ah, é TRV-8827. Terceiro mês seguido que isso tá acontecendo.
312. Certo certo, tá então... deixa eu ver aqui... TRV-8827... hmm, consegui puxar agora e, nossa, tô vendo o histórico de pagamento e sim, você tá absolutamente certo sobre os atrasos... Deixa eu só verificar o que tá, é, o que tá rolando com seu pagamento de novembro...
Customer: Ah, então qual é a desculpa dessa vez? Deixa eu adivinhar, é, atrasos no processamento?
313. Na verdade, hmm, o que tô vendo aqui é... tá, isso é interessante... seu ID de pagamento PAY-11-9982-QV aparece como aprovado do nosso lado mas, é, deixa eu verificar a fila de desembolso mesmo... Desculpa, o sistema tá meio lento hoje...
Customer: É, olha, eu faço quiz toda terça. Tenho, ah, contas pra pagar aqui.
314. Não não, eu entendo completamente e... hmm, péra, acho que achei algo... Então sua conta ACC-8827-VENUE foi, é, marcada pra revisão manual todo mês? Isso é... tá, isso não deveria tá acontecendo, especialmente não por três meses...
Customer: Revisão manual? Ah, o que isso significa?
315. Tá tá.
Customer: É, alô? Você ainda tá aí? O que, ah, o que tá acontecendo?
316. Desculpa desculpa, eu tô só... deixa eu pensar aqui... Então basicamente alguém colocou uma marcação na sua conta, código FLG-0823, e tá forçando todos seus pagamentos pra esse, é, esse processo de revisão super lento que honestamente nem deveria se aplicar pra anfitriões de local...
Customer: Tá então, é, você pode só remover então? Ah, parece bem simples.
317. Sim com certeza, eu tô na verdade... hmm, deixa eu fazer isso agora mesmo... removendo a marcação FLG-0823... e já que tô aqui, vou colocar uma tag de prioridade, tipo PRI-VENUE-01, na sua conta pra isso não acontecer de novo...
Customer: É, isso é, ah, muito útil mesmo. Valeu.
318. Claro! E olha, tô vendo aqui que você tá com a gente desde, hmm, deixa eu ver... desde 2021 pelo arquivo REG-2021-0447, fazendo terças à noite consistentemente... Vou também solicitar processamento acelerado pro seu pagamento pendente...
Customer: Ah, quanto tempo vai levar? É, quer dizer, eu agradeço, só tô querendo saber.
319. Então com o código acelerado EXP-11-30-A que acabei de enviar, você deve ver o pagamento em, hmm, provavelmente 24 a 48 horas em vez da semana normal... E tô fazendo uma anotação aqui sobre os três meses de atraso pra possível compensação...
Customer: Nossa, é, uau. Tá, então isso é, ah, bem melhor do que eu esperava.
320. Sim e na verdade, sabe de uma coisa? Já que você teve que ligar sobre isso... Tô te mandando um email de confirmação com número de referência REF-CS-99847 que tem meu ramal direto, então se tiver QUALQUER problema mês que vem, você pode pular a fila e me ligar direto, beleza?
Character 1: Então, hum, você vai apresentar aquele novo estudo cardíaco amanhã? Ouvi dizer que, bom, tem rolado uma certa controvérsia sobre a metodologia.
321. É, então, eu vou apresentar às 14h, sabe, logo depois do almoço quando todo mundo tá sonolento, e é... os resultados preliminares com certeza vão causar polêmica. A gente tá basicamente sugerindo que tudo que pensávamos saber sobre o timing dos betabloqueadores pode estar completamente ao contrário.
Character 1: Pera, ah, tudo [confuso] que a gente sabia? Acho que é uma afirmação bem ousada pra um ensaio de fase 2.
322. Parece dramático, [pausa breve] eu sei, mas já replicamos os resultados três vezes com coortes diferentes de pacientes. Os dados mostram que a administração pré-operatória pode na verdade aumentar as complicações em certas populações, o que vai contra 40 anos de prática padrão.
Character 1: Isso, na verdade, vai dar pano pra manga. Você já, tipo, passou isso pro Henderson?
323. O Henderson é o motivo de eu estar sinceramente nervoso—hmm, ele literalmente escreveu o capítulo do livro sobre isso, tipo, construiu a carreira inteira em cima do protocolo que agora estamos questionando. Ele vai presidir minha sessão amanhã, e não faço ideia de como vai reagir quando eu basicamente desmontar o trabalho da vida dele.
Character 1: Meu Deus. [tom grave] Você vai apresentar suicídio profissional pro cara que pode acabar com sua carreira. Isso é corajoso.
324. A questão é que os dados são o que são, basicamente, e ah, não posso simplesmente ignorá-los porque são inconvenientes. Ciência deveria ser sobre desafiar pressupostos, mesmo quando esses pressupostos pertencem a pessoas que controlam seu financiamento e suas decisões de estabilidade.
Character 1: O que a chefe do seu departamento acha disso tudo?
325. Ela tá sendo apoiadora, quer dizer, [gritando] publicamente pelo menos, mas cara, dá pra ver que ela tá preocupada com as consequências políticas! Ela fica me lembrando de ser "diplomático" e "respeitoso com a pesquisa estabelecida", que é código pra "por favor não faça inimigos poderosos nessa conferência."
Character 1: Isso tá me deixando [chorando alto] ansioso só de ouvir. E se eles te destroçarem durante a sessão de perguntas?
326. É que eu tenho praticado respostas pra todos os ataques possíveis, meio que ensaiando com minha equipe, enfim, passamos por todas as críticas potenciais. Mas você não consegue realmente se preparar pra quando a identidade profissional inteira de alguém é ameaçada pelos seus achados—é aí que as coisas ficam pessoais, não científicas.
Character 1: Talvez você deveria, é, enquadrar de forma diferente? Provavelmente amenizar as implicações de alguma forma?
327. Tá, então, [curioso] como exatamente eu amenizo "seu protocolo pode estar matando pessoas"? Na verdade, essa é a mensagem central aqui. Encontramos um aumento de 23% nas complicações pós-operatórias com o timing tradicional, e dourar a pílula seria profissionalmente irresponsável, talvez até eticamente questionável.
Character 1: Caramba. 23 por cento? Isso é, é... sabe, isso não é uma variação pequena.
328. É enorme, e é por isso que tenho que apresentar, mesmo que signifique me tornar persona non grata nos círculos de cardiologia. Se estivermos certos e não falarmos, pessoas podem morrer desnecessariamente—isso pesa mais que o ego de qualquer um, incluindo o meu.
Character 1: Bom, você considerou, hum, talvez coautorar com alguém mais estabelecido? Pra proteção?
329. A gente tentou isso, tipo, três pesquisadores sêniores olharam nossos dados, sinceramente, e todos recuaram devagar—hmm, um até disse "estou muito perto da aposentadoria pra essa briga." Ninguém quer o nome num artigo que vai começar uma guerra, mesmo que possa salvar vidas.
Character 1: Isso é basicamente [triste] deprimente. Ciência não deveria funcionar assim, ah, não deveria ser sobre política.
330. Bem-vindo à medicina acadêmica, onde estar certo é menos importante que ser educado, e onde desafiar o status quo exige ou estabilidade ou desejo de morte—e eu não tenho nenhum dos dois, só dados e um senso de dever provavelmente equivocado.
Character 1: dialogue Character 2
Character 1: dialogue Character 1
Character 1: Por que uma tonalidade menor automaticamente soa triste?
331. Isso é na verdade uma mistura fascinante de física e cultura! O intervalo de terça menor cria frequências harmônicas ligeiramente diferentes que nosso cérebro processa de outro jeito, mas a associação com "tristeza" é basicamente aprendida através de séculos de tradição musical ocidental.
Character 1: Mas tipo, quer dizer, é mesmo só, sabe, condicionamento cultural?
332. Não totalmente - tem algumas propriedades acústicas universais em jogo. Tons menores têm mais harmônicos dissonantes na sua série harmônica, criando uma tensão sutil que muitas culturas independentemente associam com emoções mais sombrias.
Character 1: Então, hum, e quanto a, sei lá, música não-ocidental?
333. Ótima pergunta! Os ragas indianos e maqams árabes usam sistemas de escalas completamente diferentes com quartos de tom e intervalos microtonais que nem cabem na nossa divisão binária maior/menor. Eles conseguem expressar emoções incrivelmente específicas pra que a gente nem tem vocabulário musical.
Character 1: Pera, quartos de tom são, é... [murmurando] basicamente notas entre as, sabe, notas normais?
334. Exatamente! Imagina ter teclas entre as teclas do piano - é isso que muitas tradições musicais usam. O makam turco tem 53 notas por oitava comparado com as nossas 12, permitindo nuances emocionais incrivelmente sutis.
Character 1: Isso dá um nó na minha cabeça.
335. É bizarro quando você [espirro] encontra isso pela primeira vez, sério! Nossos ouvidos são tão, bom, treinados pro temperamento igual de doze tons que, na verdade, ouvir música microtonal de verdade pode parecer quase errado no começo.
Character 1: Hmm, mas tipo, por que a gente, ah, ficou com doze notas mesmo?
336. Pura conveniência matemática, na real. Doze divide certinho por 2, 3, 4 e 6, facilitando construir intervalos harmoniosos, embora seja na verdade um compromisso - nenhum intervalo exceto a oitava tá perfeitamente afinado.
Character 1: Como assim não tá perfeitamente afinado?
337. Bom, então, no temperamento igual, a gente basicamente, hum, desafinou levemente cada intervalo pra fazer todas as tonalidades igualmente tocáveis. Uma quinta "justa" no piano tá na verdade 2 cents abaixo da proporção matemática pura.
Character 1: Dois cents? Tipo dinheiro?
338. Não não, cents em música são, é... [amargo] centésimos de um semitom - é que, sabe, a maioria das pessoas nem consegue ouvir diferenças menores que 5-10 cents. A gente basicamente concordou em viver com música levemente desafinada por conveniência.
Character 1: Isso é estranhamente deprimente.
339. Quer dizer, na verdade é, bom, meio que libertador! Mostra que música não é uma verdade matemática perfeita mas, hmm, um acordo humano bagunçado que de alguma forma ainda cria beleza.
Character 1: Tá, então, ahh, se nada tá [gargalhada] realmente afinado, tipo, por que ainda soa bem?
340. Porque nossos cérebros são, hum, notavelmente adaptáveis e, olha só, a gente busca padrões e basicamente encontra harmonia na imperfeição! Além disso, essas leves, é, desafinações na verdade criam aquele efeito "batimento" caloroso que faz pianos soarem vivos em vez de estéreis.
Character 1: So, um, I've been having these, [pigarreando], você sabe, floaters na minha visão ultimamente. É algo que, er, devo me preocupar?
341. Well, floaters are actually pretty common, principalmente quando a gente fica mais velho, e hmm, na maioria das vezes são só pedacinhos de proteína ou células flutuando no vítreo—o gel que preenche o olho, sabe? Mas tipo, aparecimento súbito ou um aumento dramático de floaters pode às vezes sinalizar algo mais sério que a gente precisaria verificar.
Character 1: Sudden onset? Like, I guess I noticed them about, uhh, umas 2 semanas atrás? Eles são meio chatos quando tô lendo.
342. Two weeks is relatively recent. Você tá [chateado] vendo flashes de luz também? Eles geralmente aparecem junto com floaters quando tem envolvimento da retina.
Character 1: Flashes? Não, não tem flashes. Só esses pontinhos escuros que ficam flutuando quando eu mexo os olhos.
343. Okay so, that's reassuring, você sabe, mas honestamente, eu ainda quero dilatar seus olhos e, err, dar uma boa olhada na sua retina. Às vezes o que parece benigno pode ser um sinal de alerta precoce de uma ruptura ou descolamento de retina, especialmente se você é míope ou teve algum trauma na cabeça recentemente.
Character 1: Head trauma? Bem, eu bati a cabeça bem forte saindo do carro mês passado.
344. Hmm, that's [curioso] interesting timing actually. Até trauma menor pode, basicamente, fazer o vítreo se descolar da retina, e bem, isso é chamado descolamento vítreo posterior. Geralmente é inofensivo mas vale a pena examinar pra ter certeza que não tem ruptura.
Character 1: Tearing sounds bad. Muito ruim mesmo.
345. I don't want to [hesitante] alarm you unnecessarily, mas rupturas de retina não tratadas podem progredir pra descolamento, que é uma emergência médica. A boa notícia é que se a gente pegar cedo, podemos frequentemente tratar com um procedimento de laser simples aqui mesmo no consultório.
Character 1: A laser? No meu olho? Enquanto eu tô acordado?
346. I know it sounds, ah, [ofegando alto] terrifying when you put it that way! Mas sério, é que o procedimento é bem confortável na verdade—umm, a gente usa colírio anestésico e o laser essencialmente cria pequenas queimaduras que selam a ruptura. A maioria dos pacientes diz que a antecipação foi pior que o tratamento em si, e de qualquer forma, a coisa toda leva uns 10 minutos.
Character 1: Ten minutes to save my vision. Quando você coloca dessa forma...
347. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, tipo, a maioria dos floaters são completamente benignos, sabe? Eu vejo provavelmente uns 20 pacientes por semana com floaters novos, e er, talvez 1 precise de alguma intervenção. As chances estão definitivamente a seu favor aqui.
Character 1: But, um, if it is serious, bem, quão rápido a gente precisaria, na verdade, agir?
348. So if I see a tear today, honestamente, a gente ia querer tratar dentro de, uhh, 1 ou 2 dias—basicamente antes de ter qualquer chance de progredir. Descolamentos de retina podem acontecer rápido, às vezes em questão de horas depois que uma ruptura se forma, por isso que eu nunca falo pra pacientes com floaters novos "esperar pra ver".
Character 1: Hours? Meu Deus, isso é, quer dizer, agora tô realmente nervoso. Eu deveria ter, err, vindo mais cedo? Tipo, imediatamente quando notei?
349. You did the right thing coming in now. Duas semanas não é perigosamente longo pra floaters estáveis, e você não tá experienciando as verdadeiras bandeiras vermelhas—sem perda de visão, sem cortina ou sombra na sua visão periférica, sem flashes de relâmpago.
Character 1: Curtain in my vision? Isso é, hmm, estranhamente específico. É, você sabe, realmente como parece?
350. That's exactly what patients describe—como se alguém tivesse puxando uma cortina escura sobre parte do campo visual deles, e [aliviado] felizmente você não tá experienciando isso. Deixa eu começar com o colírio dilatador pra gente poder dar uma olhada direito e espero que deixar você completamente tranquilo.
Character 1: Peraí, hum, Dr. Martinez? É o senhor mesmo? Eu não, ah, esperava te ver aqui na linha de chegada.
351. Meu Deus, sim, sou eu! Eu faço trabalho voluntário aqui todo ano lendo os números de peito e os tempos. Número 487, doze horas e quatorze minutos! Você conseguiu mesmo, tô muito orgulhoso de você!
Character 1: O senhor faz trabalho voluntário aqui? Em provas de Iron Man?
352. Faço sim, na verdade, virou essa, bom, tradição anual pra mim. Número 392, doze horas e quinze minutos! O negócio é que eu acho incrivelmente terapêutico ver as pessoas superando seus limites—me lembra por que a resiliência mental importa tanto.
Character 1: Eu não consigo, é... acreditar que você tá me vendo assim. Eu tô, sinceramente, um bagaço agora.
353. Escuta, quer dizer, você acabou de completar, hum, 226 quilômetros de pura determinação! Número 518, doze horas e dezesseis minutos! Sabe, isso é exatamente o que a gente tem trabalhado nas nossas sessões—continuar quando cada parte sua quer desistir.
Character 1: Minhas pernas parecem gelatina. Tudo dói.
354. Isso é seu corpo processando uma conquista incrível. Número 423, doze horas e dezessete minutos! Olha, deixa eu pegar uma bebida de recuperação pra você no posto de voluntários enquanto a gente conversa—você precisa desesperadamente de eletrólitos agora.
Character 1: O senhor, ah, me viu durante a prova? Eu quase, sabe, desisti no quilômetro 32 da maratona.
355. Eu te vi em vários pontos de controle, na verdade, e sim, é... notei você com dificuldade no quilômetro 32. Número 551, doze horas e dezoito minutos! Mas olha só, você usou exatamente a técnica de visualização que praticamos—eu vi você fechar os olhos, respirar fundo três vezes, e continuar em frente.
Character 1: Dava pra perceber? Mesmo de, tipo, longe? Caramba, eu tava, hum, desmoronando ali.
356. A conexão mente-corpo fica tão visível em provas de resistência. Número 602, doze horas e dezenove minutos! O que importa é que você reconheceu o ponto de crise e aplicou suas estratégias de enfrentamento em vez de deixar o diálogo interno negativo tomar conta.
Character 1: O diálogo interno negativo tava gritando comigo o tempo todo mesmo.
357. Claro que tava, quer dizer, isso é completamente normal! Número 445, doze horas e vinte minutos! O negócio é que você ouviu mas, bom, não deixou ele dirigir o carro, por assim dizer—essa é a diferença entre ouvir pensamentos e acreditar neles.
Character 1: Eu ficava repetindo aquele [bocejo] mantra que você me ensinou. "Eu sou mais forte que minhas desculpas."
358. E olha onde te levou, né, você tá aqui como finisher de Iron Man! Número 389, doze horas e vinte e um minutos! Sinceramente, isso é uma evidência poderosa de que, sabe, o trabalho que fazemos na terapia se traduz em resiliência no mundo real.
Character 1: Mundo real? Isso pareceu outro planeta. A dor era surreal.
359. A dor é inevitável mas, hum, o sofrimento é opcional—lembra daquela citação que discutimos? Número 512, doze horas e vinte e dois minutos! Enfim, você escolheu reinterpretar a dor como, basicamente, informação em vez de emergência, que é exatamente o que atletas de elite fazem.
Character 1: Eu não me sinto [empaticamente] muito elite agora. Mais tipo, ah, um macarrão molhado que, na verdade, pode vomitar.
360. Essa é a beleza da coisa—elite não é sobre se sentir invencível, é sobre continuar quando você se sente exatamente como agora. Número 478, doze horas e vinte e três minutos! Vem, vamos te levar pra tenda médica pra uma checagem rápida, e a gente pode conversar sobre essa conquista incrível na nossa sessão de terça.
Character 1: You must be the new [condescending] hire everyone's been talking about.
361. Oh, um, yes that's me! I'm really [encantado] excited to be here, you know, everyone's been so welcoming and I've heard, like, amazing things about the team culture here!
Character 1: I'm Alex. I, uh, run the engineering team here, so basically we'll be working together quite a bit.
362. Nice to meet you Alex! Well, I've actually heard great things about your team's work on, err, the infrastructure project—it sounds like you've built something, I mean, really impressive here!
Character 1: Right. Look, I should [frustrado] mention that we, umm, move pretty fast here and honestly expect everyone to, you know, keep up.
363. Oh absolutely, I thrive in fast-paced environments! So, I've worked at, like, three startups before this, and the thing is, I actually prefer when things move quickly rather than getting bogged down in endless meetings!
Character 1: Three startups. Hmm, that's either really impressive or, well, kind of concerning, I guess.
364. Ha, I get that reaction [zangado] a lot actually! But each move was strategic—I stayed at each company through major milestones and left on great terms when better opportunities for growth came along!
Character 1: What was your last role exactly?
365. I was leading a team of twelve engineers at DataSync, where we built their entire real-time analytics platform from scratch! We processed about fifty billion events daily by the time I left, which was pretty wild!
Character 1: Fifty billion events [very quickly] daily that's actually quite impressive for a team that size.
366. Thanks! It required some creative architecture decisions, but we managed to keep costs down while maintaining sub-second query times across the board—optimization became my personal obsession there!
Character 1: We have similar scale challenges here.
367. That's exciting to hear! You know, scale problems are actually, uhh, what drew me to this role—I saw your blog post about, anyway, the distributed caching solution and thought wow, these folks really get it!
Character 1: My blog post. So you've [amargo] been doing your homework, err, which is more than, like, most candidates bother with these days.
368. Well, I believe in coming prepared! Honestly, I spent the whole weekend reading through your engineering blog because, hmm, I wanted to understand the technical decisions and, sort of, the philosophy behind them!
Character 1: That's... [bem baixinho] I mean, that's actually really, uh, refreshing to hear.
369. I'm genuinely excited about the problems you're solving here! The way you approached sharding in that one post was elegant—I'd love to hear more about how that evolved over time!
Character 1: Maybe we should grab coffee sometime this week and I can walk you through our architecture.
370. I'd love that! Coffee sounds perfect, and I have about a million questions about your microservices strategy that I'd love to pick your brain about if you're willing!
Character 1: Hey, I need help understanding our software licensing structure, sabe, é meio complicado pra mim.
371. Oh, um, sure! Então, [very slowly] licenciamento pode ser bem complexo, mas basicamente, eu desenvolvi um framework que categoriza eles em, sabe, 5 buckets principais baseados em direitos de uso e restrições.
Character 1: Five buckets? Isso parece bem organizado.
372. Right! Temos licenças perpétuas, baseadas em assinatura, modelos de usuário concorrente, licenças de site, e arranjos OEM—cada um tem estruturas de custo distintas e requisitos de compliance que afetam nosso resultado final de forma diferente.
Character 1: I've been, uh, struggling with the [child-like] renewal dates, porque, tipo, elas estão espalhadas por todo lado e, cara, é realmente confuso.
373. Yeah, well, that's a common problem! O negócio é que eu na verdade construí um sistema de rastreamento que, hmm, consolida todas as datas de renovação e manda alertas automáticos, sabe, 30 e 60 dias antes do vencimento.
Character 1: Does it, err, handle different vendor portals? Porque honestamente, cada um tem, tipo, seu próprio login e eu acho, interfaces diferentes.
374. It integrates with twelve major vendor APIs, e pro resto, a gente usa automação robótica de processos pra extrair os dados—levei 3 meses pra aperfeiçoar mas agora tá totalmente automatizado!
Character 1: Three months? Isso é, um, um baita investimento de tempo, né.
375. Oh absolutely, so worth every [sarcástico] second, quando você considera que a gente tava, na verdade, sangrando dinheiro em auto-renovações que não precisávamos e, uhh, perdendo atualizações críticas em licenças que precisávamos!
Character 1: How much were we losing?
376. Last quarter alone? Uns [sarcástico] 80 mil dólares em licenças zumbis—software que ninguém tinha tocado em mais de 6 meses mas continuava renovando automaticamente porque ninguém rastreava as métricas de uso!
Character 1: Eighty thousand? Caramba, isso é insano! Eu não fazia ideia que tava, sabe, tão ruim assim.
377. Most companies don't realize until they audit! Eu cruzo referências de logs de uso com atribuições de licença mensalmente agora, e a gente cortou gastos desnecessários em 43 por cento desde a implementação.
Character 1: What about compliance risks?
378. Compliance is, honestly, where things get [muito melancólico] really scary—uma descoberta de auditoria pode resultar em, err, penalidades que fazem qualquer economia parecer pequena, então eu construí verificações de compliance automatizadas que rodam, acho, semanalmente em todos os sistemas.
Character 1: Have we had any close calls?
379. Two actually! A gente descobriu, hmm, que estávamos sub-licenciados no nosso software CAD por, basicamente, 15 seats e super-licenciados em ferramentas de gerenciamento de projeto por, tipo, 40 seats—equilibrou financeiramente mas legalmente são situações bem diferentes!
Character 1: Wait, under-licensed [alto] on CAD software? Isso podia ter sido um desastre!
380. Exactly! Então agora eu implementei, sabe, monitoramento de uso em tempo real que, na verdade, sinaliza qualquer discrepância imediatamente e, bem, automaticamente submete pedidos de compra quando a gente atinge, umm, 80 por cento da capacidade em qualquer pool de licenças!
Character 1: Então, é... eu tenho tido dificuldade, sabe, de lembrar das coisas ultimamente e, bom, tá ficando frustrante.
381. Ah, quer dizer, isso é totalmente normal! Melhoria de memória é, na verdade, algo que venho pesquisando há anos, e pra falar a verdade, a maioria das pessoas só precisa de estratégias melhores de codificação do que de recuperação.
Character 1: Estratégias de codificação? Eu, ah, não entendo muito bem o que isso, tipo, significa exatamente.
382. Certo, então codificação é como seu cérebro inicialmente processa e armazena informação. A maioria das falhas de memória acontece porque nunca codificamos a informação direito pra começar—estávamos distraídos ou fazendo várias coisas ao mesmo tempo.
Character 1: Faz sentido. Eu sempre tô fazendo cinco coisas ao mesmo tempo.
383. Exatamente o problema! Eu uso uma coisa chamada elaboração, onde você conecta informação nova a redes de conhecimento existentes—funciona muito melhor do que só ficar repetindo.
Character 1: Como isso funciona na prática?
384. Digamos que você conhece alguém chamada Rosa—ao invés de só repetir "Rosa, Rosa, Rosa", você pode pensar nas rosas do jardim da sua avó, na cor rosa, nos espinhos, no Dia dos Namorados. Você tá criando múltiplos caminhos de recuperação.
Character 1: Eu tentei palácios [muito timidamente] de memória uma vez mas não consegui fazer funcionar.
385. Palácios de memória são poderosos mas precisam de prática! Começa menor com o método de associação—só encadeia dois itens com imagens mentais vívidas e ridículas que te façam rir ou sentir vergonha.
Character 1: Mas eu fico [furioso] esquecendo prazos importantes do trabalho e isso tá afetando minhas avaliações de desempenho!
386. Pra prazos especificamente, é... eu uso o que chamam, sabe, de intenções de implementação—basicamente você liga a tarefa a, hum, um gatilho específico tipo "quando eu sentar com meu café da manhã, vou checar os cronogramas dos projetos."
Character 1: Isso realmente funciona a longo prazo?
387. Estudos mostram que intenções de implementação dobram as taxas de execução! O segredo é fazer o gatilho inevitável e a ação específica—não "vou me exercitar mais" mas "depois de escovar os dentes, vou fazer 10 flexões."
Character 1: E pra lembrar nomes em eventos de networking?
388. O método FACE funciona super bem—Foca no rosto da pessoa, Pergunta sobre a origem do nome, Conecta com alguém que você conhece, depois Emprega o nome três vezes na conversa naturalmente.
Character 1: Eu, hum, sempre fico [voz trêmula] tão ansioso que vou esquecer, tipo, logo depois que me falam, sabe?
389. Ansiedade na verdade, bom, prejudica a memória de trabalho! Então eu ensino as pessoas a, é, respirar fundo primeiro, e aí basicamente, repetir o nome imediatamente fazendo contato visual—"Prazer em te conhecer, Sandra."
Character 1: Você já, tipo, viu melhorias [animado] reais em pessoas usando essas, na verdade, técnicas?
390. Com certeza! Meus clientes relatam 60 a 80 por cento de melhoria na memorização depois de só duas semanas de prática—a neuroplasticidade do cérebro significa que podemos literalmente reconectar nossos circuitos de memória em qualquer idade!
Character 1: I presume, um, you understand the gravity of, bem, o que você tá propondo aqui—as implicações são, na verdade, muito mais amplas do que você considerou.
391. I've been doing this for, er, 15 years, e eu acho que [condescending] entendo as implicações melhor que, sabe, alguém que acabou de entrar no meu escritório 5 minutos atrás pedindo favores.
Character 1: Your fifteen years haven't prepared you for, o que vai passar por aquela porta à meia-noite.
392. Look, I've handled delicate situations before—incidentes internacionais, espionagem corporativa, coisas que fariam sua cabeça girar. Seja lá o que for isso, a gente pode achar uma solução que não envolve tons ameaçadores.
Character 1: Threatening? No, eu tô, hmm, simplesmente articulando consequências que, basicamente, existem independente do meu envolvimento—a realidade tem, quer dizer, seus próprios mecanismos de aplicação.
393. Right, so, philosophical intimidation now—isso é refrescante, sinceramente. Mas olha só, sejam quais forem os mecanismos de aplicação que você tá, uhh, insinuando, eu tenho minhas próprias contingências que ativam se eu não fizer check-in.
Character 1: Your contingencies assume a predictable adversary, operando dentro de parâmetros convencionais.
394. And you're suggesting you're something else entirely? Porque de onde eu tô sentado, você parece com toda outra pessoa que tentou usar medo pra conseguir obediência.
Character 1: Fear is, well, such a crude instrument—eu prefiro, sabe, interesse próprio esclarecido, que é por isso que, er, tô te oferecendo essa oportunidade em vez de simplesmente pegar o que eu preciso.
395. Opportunity implies choice, e você não apresentou isso exatamente como opcional. Então vamos cortar a pretensão e você me diz o que você realmente quer.
Character 1: I want [severo] the Kellerman files, completos e sem censura, dentro de 72 horas.
396. Those files were destroyed in the data center fire three years ago—todo mundo sabe disso. Mesmo se existissem cópias, o que não existem, acessá-las exigiria autorizações que não existem mais.
Character 1: We both know that fire was, notavelmente seletivo no que consumiu.
397. You're fishing for something that genuinely doesn't exist anymore. Eu vi aqueles servidores derreterem pessoalmente, fiquei lá no calor até a segurança me arrastar pra fora.
Character 1: Physical destruction rarely equals, destruição de informação no nosso ramo de trabalho.
398. Look, I mean, even if—e isso é, na verdade, um "se" gigantesco—fragmentos de backup existissem em algum lugar, reconstruí-los levaria, uhh, meses de recursos computacionais que simplesmente não temos mais acesso.
Character 1: The quantum lab at, um, Berkshire still owes you favors, e os sistemas deles poderiam, bem, [hesitante] processar esses fragmentos em umas, er, 16 horas se propriamente motivados.
399. You've done your homework, clearly. Mas envolver Berkshire significa envolver a Diretora Chen, e ela não é exatamente conhecida por discrição quando crimes federais estão na mesa.
Character 1: Director Chen relocated to [choro] Singapore last Tuesday, sob circunstâncias que ela preferiria que permanecessem privadas.
400. Wait, so, Chen's gone? Isso muda, uhh, tudo—sem a supervisão dela, o laboratório tá basicamente [quickly] operando numa zona cinzenta legal onde, sabe, certos pedidos poderiam realmente ser viáveis agora.
Character 1: Cara, eu tô, tipo, completamente chocado com o fato de que, hum, ondas gravitacionais tão [triste] basicamente rolando pelo universo agora mesmo, sabe, tipo uns graves cósmicos.
401. Ah mano, eu consigo, é, totalmente sentir essa energia que você tá passando—é [empaticamente] lindo mesmo como você tá conectando com isso, tipo, o universo é essa balada gigante e a gente tá aqui, sabe, curtindo frequências que mal conseguimos detectar.
Character 1: Os detectores LIGO são [espirro] basicamente—atchim!—desculpa, basicamente os subwoofers do universo!
402. Isso! E, é, quando aqueles buracos negros colidiram há um bilhão de anos atrás, eles mandaram, bom, ondulações que ainda tão chegando até a gente agora, tipo como esse grave do palco principal tá literalmente passando pelos nossos corpos nesse exato segundo.
Character 1: É [pausa breve] insano como o próprio espaço-tempo fica esticado e comprimido.
403. A parte mais louca é que a gente tá falando de distâncias mudando por menos que a largura de um próton—imagina tentar ouvir um sussurro num show a um quilômetro de distância, só que um trilhão de vezes mais difícil.
Character 1: Meu professor de física disse que o Einstein previu isso tudo cem anos antes da gente conseguir provar.
404. Einstein foi basicamente o [muito animado] headliner definitivo que lançou esse álbum teórico gigantesco que levamos um século pra apreciar de verdade! Tipo, ele sabia que o espaço-tempo podia ondular e dançar antes de qualquer um ter o equipamento pra ouvir a batida!
Character 1: Pera, você é a pessoa que tava dando aquela palestra na tenda de ciência mais cedo?
405. Pego no flagra! Eu faço divulgação científica pra colaboração de ondas gravitacionais, tentando explicar como a gente tá literalmente ouvindo o batimento cardíaco do universo enquanto o pessoal tá aqui pela música.
Character 1: Isso é, hmm, muito maneiro—quer dizer, trazer astrofísica de verdade pra, é, um festival é meio genial.
406. Bom, na real, festivais são perfeitos pra isso porque, é, as pessoas já tão nessa vibe de sentir vibrações e, tipo, experienciar ondas—ondas sonoras, ondas de luz, e pô, sabe, por que não adicionar ondas gravitacionais na mistura?
Character 1: Mas dá pra sentir ondas gravitacionais mesmo? Tipo fisicamente?
407. De fontes astronômicas não, não—elas são fracas demais. Mas tecnicamente toda vez que você pula, você tá criando suas próprias ondas gravitacionais minúsculas, só que impossivelmente pequenas que se dissipam instantaneamente.
Character 1: Então, tipo, a gente não consegue sentir elas de jeito nenhum? Isso é, hum, [frustrado] meio decepcionante—eu achei que talvez, bom, com o equipamento certo ou algo assim...
408. Eu entendo a frustração, mas pensa assim—a gente construiu máquinas tão sensíveis que conseguem detectar o próprio espaço se esticando por menos de um milésimo da largura de um próton. É tipo medir a distância até a estrela mais próxima e perceber se ela se moveu pela largura de um fio de cabelo.
Character 1: Como é que eles filtram todo o ruído? Só esse festival já deve tá balançando o chão por quilômetros.
409. Pois é! Eles usam sistemas de isolamento incríveis, múltiplos detectores a milhares de quilômetros de distância, e cruzam todas as referências. Só sinais que aparecem em múltiplos detectores com o timing certo são marcados como possíveis ondas gravitacionais.
Character 1: Isso parece, é, incrivelmente complexo e, honestamente, meio [entediado] cansativo quando você tá, ahh, tentando curtir a vibe do festival.
410. Justo! Às vezes é melhor só sentir o grave bater e saber que em algum lugar lá fora, buracos negros tão fazendo sua própria dança cósmica que a gente tá só começando a aprender a ouvir.
Character 1: Então você tá dizendo que nossa estrutura de governança de dados precisa de uma reformulação completa?
411. As hierarquias taxonômicas atuais de vocês estão fundamentalmente desalinhadas com os padrões de conformidade ISO 15489. Estamos falando de um ciclo de implementação mínimo de 18 meses pra estabelecer esquemas de metadados adequados, integrar seus ERPs dispersos e alcançar normalização estatística básica em todas as verticais.
Character 1: Mas, é... a gente já tem um sistema pra, tipo, rastrear nossos registros.
412. Bom, o que vocês têm é, sabe, uma série de repositórios isolados operando sem ontologias padronizadas, basicamente criando o que chamamos de entropia informacional. O tempo médio de recuperação de documentos de vocês tá 4,7 desvios padrão acima dos benchmarks do setor, indicando ineficiências estruturais graves nos protocolos de indexação.
Character 1: Isso parece, ah, caro—acho que a gente precisaria, meio que, justificar isso pro conselho.
413. Os cálculos de ROI mostram um retorno de 347% em cinco anos quando você considera a redução de multas de compliance, custos de discovery em litígios e ganhos de produtividade por eliminar entrada de dados redundante nos seus 17 sistemas de registro diferentes.
Character 1: Pera, espera—é... como você sequer, o negócio é, calculou esses números específicos?
414. Utilizamos simulações Monte Carlo com, hum, 10.000 iterações baseadas nos seus [bem alto] dados operacionais históricos, sinceramente incorporando variáveis estocásticas como probabilidade de mudança regulatória e, tipo, índices de volatilidade de mercado! O intervalo de confiança é de 95% com margem de erro de mais ou menos 12%.
Character 1: Então, você tá dizendo, quer dizer, precisamos digitalizar tudo? Ahh, isso parece demais.
415. Não digitalização—enfim, isso é elementar—estamos falando de estabelecer, na real, um modelo abrangente de continuum de registros com, é... cronogramas de disposição integrados vinculados às políticas de retenção. Vocês vão precisar de taxonomistas dedicados, arquitetos de informação e pelo menos três gestores de registros certificados pra manter o sistema pós-implementação.
Character 1: Três posições em tempo integral só pra registros?
416. A complexidade do ambiente regulatório de vocês [articulando cada palavra] sozinha requer expertise especializada. Vocês estão sujeitos a GDPR, SOX, HIPAA e 47 regulamentações estaduais de privacidade, cada uma com requisitos distintos de retenção e trilhas de auditoria.
Character 1: Isso tá, ah, ficando demais—é que, sabe, eu achei que a gente só precisava arquivar melhor.
417. Arquivar é organização superficial. Estamos discutindo arquitetura empresarial de informação com capacidades de análise preditiva, mecanismos de classificação automatizada usando processamento de linguagem natural e dashboards de monitoramento de compliance em tempo real integrados com sua plataforma GRC.
Character 1: Quanto, é... tempo isso levaria? Tá bom então, provavelmente precisaríamos fasear de algum jeito.
418. Certo então, a Fase Um envolve, na verdade, estabelecer sua carta de governança informacional e conduzir um inventário abrangente de registros—isso é, ah, seis meses no mínimo. A Fase Dois implementa a infraestrutura técnica, mais oito meses, e a Fase Três lida com gestão de mudança e treinamento ao longo de quatro meses.
Character 1: Tô me sentindo [chorando ao falar] completamente perdido aqui—isso é muito além do que eu esperava.
419. Eu entendo que é complexo, mas, sabe, considere isso: seus dados não estruturados atuais estão crescendo exponencialmente a 73% ao ano, basicamente dobrando a cada 14 meses—bom, sem intervenção, vocês vão atingir massa crítica em dois anos. Falha do sistema se torna não uma possibilidade mas uma certeza estatística com p-valor de 0,001.
Character 1: A gente pode, hum, começar menor? Sinceramente, acho que a diretoria vai recuar diante desse escopo.
420. Poderíamos começar com uma prova de conceito no departamento financeiro de vocês, [pigarreando] focando primeiro nos registros de contas a pagar. Isso demonstraria melhorias mensuráveis no tempo de processamento, taxas de erro e prontidão para auditoria em 90 dias, dando métricas concretas pra você apresentar para adoção mais ampla.
Character 1: Você seriamente acabou de tropeçar no nada?
421. Ah meu Deus, você viu isso? Eu tava tentando parecer descolado passando por aquele grupo, and my foot just decided to betray me completely.
Character 1: A recuperação foi impressionante though.
422. É, bem, quer dizer, transformar aquilo numa corridinha estranha foi, hm, definitivamente não foi meu momento mais suave. Acho que um deles riu de mim mesmo.
Character 1: Então, uh, você conhecia algum deles, ou tipo, they were just random people?
423. Eles são da minha oficina de escrita na verdade, which makes it [devagar] muito pior porque agora eu tenho que ver eles toda quinta. Me mata agora.
Character 1: Ah qual é, ninguém [zombando] lembra dessas coisas.
424. Tá brincando? Eu ainda, er, lembro quando a Sarah derrubou a bandeja inteira do almoço na sétima série, e, sabe, that was literally 8 years ago! People remember everything embarrassing.
Character 1: Mas isso é diferente.
425. Como é diferente? Eu basicamente, hmm, acabei de fazer uma dança interpretativa chamada "Pessoa Descobre a Gravidade" e, tipo, at least 3 people witnessed my shame.
Character 1: Bem, um, maybe they thought it was, like, cativante ou, na verdade, charmoso?
426. Ninguém acha tropeçar charmoso! É que, honestly, eu tava me esforçando tanto pra parecer equilibrado naquela aula e, uhh, agora eu sou pra sempre o cara que lutou com escadas invisíveis.
Character 1: Você tá sendo dramático.
427. Eu não tô [entediado] sendo dramático, I mean, isso vai basicamente definir meu semestre inteiro! Toda crítica na oficina vai começar com eles pensando "ah sim, ele é aquele que, uh, esqueceu como andar."
Character 1: Eu te prometo que eles já esqueceram.
428. Você não viu a cara do Marcus - ele fez contato visual direto comigo no meio do tropeço, and I swear I saw his soul leave his body from secondhand embarrassment.
Character 1: Okay então, err, que tal se você simplesmente, sabe, owned it next class?
429. Assumir como? Entrar e anunciar "ei pessoal, lembram quando eu, hmm, virei uma girafa bebê aprendendo a andar?" Isso é, bem, somehow even worse!
Character 1: Só ri sobre isso se alguém mencionar.
430. Eu sei que você tá certo, é que, um, [empaticamente] esses momentinhos parecem tão enormes quando você já tá ansioso sobre se encaixar, sabe? But yeah, acho que, rir disso é provavelmente minha única opção agora.
Character 1: Então, é, eu tô lendo sobre, sabe, [laugh histerically] medicina natural e, tipo, how it might help with my chronic pain.
431. Ah, que maravilhoso que você tá explorando, na verdade, essas modalidades antigas de cura! Medicina de plantas abrange, olha, um espectro tão lindo de remédios, desde chás simples até, quer dizer, preparações mais complexas que foram usadas por milhares de anos em diferentes culturas.
Character 1: Mas, é, não é meio, tipo, pseudociência? Quer dizer, my doctor seems pretty skeptical about it.
432. Bom, muitos médicos convencionais não são, sabe, treinados em medicina botânica, mas olha só—countless pharmaceutical drugs actually originated from plant compounds. Aspirina da casca de salgueiro, digitalis da dedaleira, e, honestamente, uns 40% dos nossos medicamentos modernos têm origem vegetal.
Character 1: Hmm, eu não tinha pensado nisso, tipo, dessa forma—então, what would you recommend for someone just starting?
433. Eu sugeriria começar com, é, ervas adaptogênicas suaves [sussurro alto] como ashwagandha ou rhodiola, sabe, que ajudam seu corpo a gerenciar respostas ao estresse. Elas são super seguras, bem pesquisadas, e, na verdade, can support your overall resilience while you explore what works for you.
Character 1: Adaptógenos? Isso é, ahh, um termo novo pra mim—anyway, how do they actually work?
434. Então, adaptógenos funcionam, hmm, [sussurrando] modulando seu eixo HPA—that's your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, basicamente—ajudando a normalizar níveis de cortisol e, bom, apoiando a capacidade do seu corpo de manter homeostase durante estresse físico ou emocional.
Character 1: Isso parece promissor. E pra dor mesmo, what about actual pain relief?
435. Pra dor especificamente, cúrcuma com pimenta preta é fenomenal—os compostos de curcumina foram demonstrados em centenas de estudos pra reduzir marcadores de inflamação tão efetivamente quanto alguns anti-inflamatórios, but without the gastric side effects.
Character 1: Sério? Eu não [suspiro suave] fazia ideia que cúrcuma era tão poderosa.
436. Com certeza! E quando você combina com outras ervas anti-inflamatórias como boswellia ou gengibre, you create this synergistic effect that addresses pain from multiple pathways—não só mascarando sintomas mas realmente apoiando os processos de cura do seu corpo.
Character 1: É, quanto tempo demora, [bem baixinho] sabe, pra sentir resultados? I mean, I'm pretty impatient.
437. A maioria das pessoas nota, na verdade, mudanças sutis nas primeiras 2 semanas, mas olha—plant medicine works cumulatively. A mágica mesmo acontece, honestamente, lá pela marca de 6-8 semanas quando seu corpo teve tempo pra, bom, integrar esses compostos e estabelecer novos padrões de base.
Character 1: Então, eu deveria, é, [articulando cada palavra] me comprometer por pelo menos 2 meses então? Tipo, that's the minimum?
438. Exatamente! Pensa nisso, err, [brincando] como namorar as ervas—you wouldn't marry someone after one coffee date, right? De qualquer forma, seu corpo precisa de tempo pra, sabe, construir essa relação e encontrar seu ritmo com esses aliados vegetais.
Character 1: Aliados vegetais—eu, é, adoro esse termo. É que, bom, it feels more collaborative.
439. Que observação linda! Essa abordagem colaborativa é exatamente o que faz a medicina de plantas ser tão transformadora—você não tá forçando seu corpo à submissão, but rather inviting it into partnership with nature's intelligence.
Character 1: Onde eu deveria, é, [ansioso] conseguir essas ervas? Tipo, I'm worried about quality—na verdade, tem tanta coisa por aí.
440. Qualidade é absolutamente crucial—eu recomendaria [suspiro suave] começar com fornecedores orgânicos certificados como Mountain Rose Herbs ou Banyan Botanicals. They provide third-party testing results, sustainable sourcing information, e as ervas deles são super potentes porque são colhidas no pico do tempo terapêutico.
Character 1: Então, hm, você é o virtuoso que todo mundo tá, basicamente, elogiando muito.
441. Ah, muito gentil da sua parte dizer isso! Eu tive muita sorte de estudar com professores incríveis que me ajudaram a encontrar minha voz—music is really about sharing joy with others, not impressing them.
Character 1: Bom, eu tenho assistido suas apresentações, sabe, e elas são tecnicamente perfeitas.
442. Precisão técnica é, honestamente, só a base—o que eu realmente, tipo, sou apaixonado é conectar emocionalmente com cada ouvinte. Every performance is a conversation between the music, the performer, and the audience's hearts.
Character 1: Sua interpretação de Rachmaninoff mês passado foi... inesperada.
443. Obrigado por notar isso! Eu, na verdade, passei meses explorando as cartas pessoais dele e, quer dizer, descobrindo a ternura por trás de todo aquele poder dramático—it completely transformed how I approach those thunderous passages.
Character 1: A maioria dos performers, é, não arrisca tanto, enfim, especially at that level.
444. Você tá absolutamente certo que é, ahh, vulnerável reinterpretar peças amadas, but the thing is, music stays alive through fresh perspectives. Cada geração de músicos tem algo único pra contribuir com essas obras atemporais.
Character 1: Hmm, eu tenho lutado com minhas próprias interpretações, tipo, há anos já.
445. Essa luta mostra que você se importa profundamente com integridade artística! The most meaningful breakthroughs often come after long periods of searching—sua dedicação em encontrar sua voz autêntica é o que vai tornar suas performances especiais.
Character 1: As pessoas esperam certas coisas de alguém na minha posição.
446. Expectativas podem parecer tão, sabe, pesadas, mas elas também são, meio que, um convite pra surpreender as pessoas. When you play from your truth rather than their assumptions, você dá permissão pro público experimentar algo genuinamente transformador.
Character 1: Você faz parecer simples.
447. Definitivamente não é simples—it takes [pausa breve] tremendous courage to be vulnerable through your art. Mas essa vulnerabilidade é exatamente o que cria aqueles momentos mágicos onde todos na sala se sentem compreendidos e vistos.
Character 1: Minha técnica é sólida, mas me falta aquele... brilho que você tem.
448. Certo então, olha o que eu aprendi—esse brilho não é algo que te falta, é só que, tá dentro de você esperando pra ser liberado. Sometimes we need to stop chasing perfection, e começar a abraçar nossas lindas imperfeições.
Character 1: Isso é, ah, mais fácil falar do que fazer quando você tá, eu acho, sendo constantemente avaliado.
449. Eu entendo completamente essa pressão—é, realmente, sufocante às vezes, mas, err, lembra que os maiores artistas da história foram muitas vezes mal compreendidos inicialmente. Your unique perspective is a gift, not a liability to be corrected.
Character 1: Você, uh, consideraria trabalhar comigo? Olha, eu preciso de orientação.
450. Eu ficaria, hmm, absolutamente honrado de explorar música juntos—working with someone who [devagar] actually questions and searches as deeply as you do, isso inspiraria meu próprio crescimento também.
Character 1: E se, hm, a rampa de cadeira de rodas desabar durante a cerimônia, tipo, e todo mundo, sabe, se machucar?
451. Bom, posso te garantir, quer dizer, [confiantemente] nosso engenheiro estrutural inspecionou cada rampa duas vezes, e elas tão classificadas pra aguentar 5 vezes a capacidade máxima que a gente vai precisar!
Character 1: Mas e os, é, intérpretes de libras—e se eles, na verdade, interpretarem mal os votos, assim, completamente?
452. Então, nossos intérpretes são profissionais certificados nacionalmente que já fizeram centenas de casamentos, e a gente marcou um ensaio completo amanhã especificamente pra garantir que cada palavra da sua linda cerimônia seja perfeitamente transmitida!
Character 1: Os banheiros acessíveis podem alagar, né, e aí, o negócio é que, we'd have a lawsuit on our wedding day, eu acho.
453. Nosso local ganhou 3 prêmios consecutivos de excelência em conformidade com acessibilidade—a equipe de manutenção deles verifica cada instalação de hora em hora durante eventos, and we have backup portable units just in case!
Character 1: E se, hmm, o feedback do sistema de loop de áudio estragar a música, de qualquer jeito, e todo mundo com aparelho auditivo, tipo, sofrer?
454. Hmm, por isso que contratamos o melhor técnico de áudio do estado que, é que, especializa em tecnologia de assistência auditiva—he's basically guaranteed crystal clear sound for every single guest, independente das necessidades auditivas deles!
Character 1: Tô, ahh, apavorado que, sabe, [chorando ao falar] a vovó não vai conseguir ver da seção de cadeiras de rodas, meio que.
455. Ah querido, [encantado] a gente criou plataformas elevadas com linhas de visão perfeitas especificamente pra usuários de cadeira de rodas—your grandmother will have the absolute best view in the entire venue, eu te prometo isso!
Character 1: Os cardápios em braile podem ter erros e ofender alguém importante.
456. Ah, cada cardápio em braile foi, quer dizer, verificado três vezes pelo nosso consultor cego que, na verdade, acontece de ser um revisor profissional—we're setting the gold standard for inclusive wedding materials here!
Character 1: Bom, e se a área dos cães-guia não tiver, tipo, ventilação adequada e, é, os cachorros ficarem doentes?
457. Então, a gente designou um espaço com controle de temperatura, hm, estações de água fresca, áreas de descanso super confortáveis, and we've got a veterinary technician on standby throughout the entire event!
Character 1: Alguém pode tropeçar nas faixas de piso tátil.
458. Olha, essas faixas são, né, instaladas segundo padrões internacionais de segurança e, honestamente, foram especificamente projetadas com bordas chanfradas que tornam tropeçar praticamente impossível—we're creating the safest possible environment!
Character 1: Mas mas mas [very quickly] e as alergias alimentares e restrições dietéticas e contaminação cruzada?
459. Nossa equipe de buffet tem estações de preparação separadas pra cada necessidade dietética, utensílios codificados por cor, e cartões de ingredientes detalhados em cada estação—this is going to be the most thoughtfully accommodating reception anyone's ever attended!
Character 1: Tô, hmm, com tanto medo de algo dar errado e, na verdade, estragar tudo pros nossos convidados com deficiência, sabe, [empaticamente] I just want everyone to feel welcome.
460. Escuta, sua preocupação mostra o quanto você se importa, que [brincando] é por isso que eu preparei um plano de contingência de 47 páginas, mas honestamente, this wedding will be a beautiful celebration where absolutely everyone can participate fully and joyfully!
Character 1: Então, tô tentando entender como ideias novas, sabe, actually spread through organizations, basicamente.
461. Ótima pergunta! A teoria da difusão de inovações explica [risadinha] exatamente esse processo—mostra como novas ideias, tecnologias, ou práticas gradualmente são adotadas por uma população ao longo do tempo, through specific channels and stages.
Character 1: Mas tipo, por que algumas pessoas, é, adotam coisas mais rápido que outras, quer dizer?
462. Bom, é aí que entram as categorias de adotantes do Rogers, sabe, que classificam pessoas baseadas na, uh, disposição delas pra abraçar mudanças—os inovadores pulam primeiro, tipo representando uns 2.5% da população, followed by early adopters at 13.5%.
Character 1: O que faz alguém [amigável] ser um inovador versus um early adopter?
463. Os inovadores são tomadores de risco com alta liquidez financeira que conseguem lidar com possíveis falhas, enquanto os early adopters são mais como líderes de opinião, who carefully evaluate innovations but have the respect to influence others' decisions.
Character 1: Hmm, e quanto à, [pausa breve], maioria das pessoas, na verdade, que não são, sabe, early to adopt?
464. A maioria inicial, uns 34%, adota inovações quando vê prova de sucesso, enquanto a maioria tardia, outros 34%, only adopts when social pressure mounts or the old way becomes impractical.
Character 1: E, uh, o último grupo, imagino, são os mais resistentes mesmo, né?
465. Exatamente—os retardatários compõem os últimos 16%, e eles são tradicionalmente orientados, often skeptical of change, e normalmente só adotam quando não tem absolutamente nenhuma outra escolha.
Character 1: Eu acho que sou, tipo, [over confidently] definitivamente um inovador, basicamente, em tudo que faço, honestamente.
466. Interessante essa autoavaliação! Keep in mind that people can be innovators in some domains while being late adopters in others—alguém pode abraçar tecnologia nova instantaneamente mas resistir mudanças na rotina de exercícios ou hábitos alimentares.
Character 1: Como as inovações realmente se movem através desses grupos?
467. Então, o processo segue uma curva S onde, um, a adoção começa devagar com os inovadores, daí, a coisa é que, acelera rapidamente através dos early adopters e da maioria, finalmente, é, diminuindo com os retardatários.
Character 1: O que determina se uma inovação vai ter sucesso?
468. Rogers identificou cinco atributos-chave que, bom, [hesitante] influenciam as taxas de adoção—vantagem relativa sobre soluções existentes, compatibilidade com valores e práticas atuais, nível de complexidade, testabilidade, and observability of results.
Character 1: Você pode me dar um exemplo real?
469. Claro! Os smartphones demonstraram todos os cinco atributos perfeitamente, sabe—eles ofereceram vantagens claras sobre os flip phones, se encaixaram nas necessidades de comunicação existentes, ficaram, na verdade, mais simples de usar com o tempo, permitiram, hmm, trial periods through stores, e os benefícios deles eram altamente visíveis pros outros.
Character 1: Como organizações, bom, podem usar essa teoria pra, tipo, introduce changes more effectively, de qualquer forma?
470. As organizações devem, uh, mirar nos early adopters primeiro como líderes de opinião, demonstrar benefícios claros, é que, provide trials or pilots, reduzir complexidade através de treinamento, e, honestamente, tornar os sucessos altamente visíveis pra encorajar a maioria a seguir!
Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about determination lately, sabe, se é algo que você nasce com isso ou desenvolve.
471. Oh that's such a fundamental question! [muito animado] Eu acho que determinação é absolutamente algo que a gente pode cultivar, é tipo um músculo que fica mais forte com prática, embora algumas pessoas possam ter tendências naturais que facilitam o desenvolvimento.
Character 1: Well, I don't know if I buy that, meio que parece pensamento positivo demais, sabe.
472. Fair enough! Mas olha a pesquisa sobre garra da Angela Duckworth, ela descobriu que perseverança e paixão por objetivos de longo prazo podem ser desenvolvidas através de prática deliberada e encontrando um propósito mais profundo no que a gente faz.
Character 1: Yeah but, er, when I look at my own life, basicamente, [muito melancólico] eu tentei ser determinado e isso simplesmente, tipo, se esvai.
473. That fizzling out is actually totally normal, determinação não é sobre nunca falhar, é sobre voltar pro seu objetivo mesmo depois de tropeçar, e talvez ajustar sua abordagem baseado no que você aprendeu desses contratempos.
Character 1: But some people just seem naturally driven, né?
474. Sure, there are individual differences, honestamente, mas, uh, a maior parte do que parece motivação natural é, a questão é, na verdade comportamento aprendido de experiências precoces, modelos de referência, e ambientes que ou recompensaram ou desencorajaram persistência.
Character 1: So, how would someone like me, eu acho, desenvolve mais determinação se isso não vem, tipo, naturalmente?
475. Start small, hmm, with tiny commitments you can actually keep, escova os dentes com sua mão não-dominante por uma semana, faz 5 flexões toda manhã, enfim, esses micro-hábitos constroem as vias neurais pra uma determinação maior.
Character 1: That sounds almost too simple to work.
476. I get the skepticism, sabe, mas a neurociência mostra que, uhh, pequenas ações consistentes literalmente reconectam nossos cérebros, é só que a gente frequentemente tenta mudar demais rápido demais e aí fica derrotado quando não consegue sustentar.
Character 1: Right so, what happens when, err, a vida atrapalha e, eu acho, interrompe esses pequenos hábitos?
477. Ah, disruptions are inevitable, sério, e a chave é planejar pra elas, ter o que os pesquisadores chamam de "intenções de implementação", que são basicamente planos se-então pra obstáculos, bom, aumenta drasticamente suas chances de se recuperar.
Character 1: Okay so, you're telling me that if I just, hmmm, [laugh histerically] planejar pro fracasso, eu vou de repente ficar determinado?
478. Not planning for failure exactly, but planning for reality! É sobre reconhecer que perfeição não é o objetivo, consistência ao longo do tempo importa muito mais que execução perfeita, e autocompaixão quando você escorrega na verdade te ajuda a voltar aos trilhos mais rápido.
Character 1: I just don't see myself as, um, alguém que consegue persistir nas coisas, praticamente.
479. That self-concept is probably your biggest barrier, nossas identidades moldam nossas ações, então se você começar a se dizer "eu sou alguém que termina o que começa" mesmo em coisas pequenas, seu comportamento começa a se alinhar com essa nova história.
Character 1: You know what, maybe I'm overthinking this whole thing, uh, e devia simplesmente, basicamente, escolher algo pequeno e começar.
480. Absolutely yes! Escolhe uma coisa pequena que importa pra você, se compromete com ela por apenas 2 semanas, e percebe como até essa pequena vitória começa a mudar sua relação com determinação, ação cria evidência de que você pode confiar em si mesmo.
Character 1: Ei, tô pensando numa coisa—você acha que as pessoas conseguem realmente mudar quem elas são fundamentalmente?
481. Essa é uma daquelas questões eternas que filósofos e psicólogos debatem há séculos. Eu acredito que podemos mudar nossos padrões e comportamentos, embora nosso temperamento básico permaneça relativamente estável—é mais sobre aprender a trabalhar com quem somos do que virar uma pessoa completamente diferente.
Character 1: Bom, é, eu tenho tentado ser mais [shy] extrovertido mas, sabe, sometimes it feels really fake.
482. Ah, eu entendo totalmente esse sentimento, sério, porque, é, mudança autêntica não significa se forçar num molde que não serve—é mais sobre, sei lá, expandir sua zona de conforto gradualmente enquanto ainda respeita suas inclinações naturais.
Character 1: Mas todo mundo fica [gritando] me dizendo que eu preciso fazer mais networking pra minha carreira!
483. Networking não precisa significar trabalhar uma sala cheia de estranhos em coquetéis, though. Alguns dos introvertidos mais bem-sucedidos que eu conheço constroem conexões profundas um-a-um através de cafés, comunidades online, ou projetos colaborativos—quality really does beat quantity here.
Character 1: Isso faz sentido mesmo. Nunca tinha pensado desse jeito.
484. Né? Então, a coisa é que a gente fica preso pensando que mudança significa, ahh, virar nosso oposto, but actually, sustainable change happens when we find ways to achieve our goals that align with our natural strengths.
Character 1: Eu só sinto que tô [gaguejando] ficando pra trás de todo mundo que parece tão confortável com tudo isso.
485. Comparação é mesmo o ladrão da alegria aqui. Todo mundo tá lutando com alguma coisa, even those people who seem totally at ease—eles só tiveram prática diferente ou tão lidando com desafios diferentes que você não consegue ver.
Character 1: Okay então, é, você tá dizendo que eu deveria, [severo] basicamente, aceitar ser esquisito e, bem, work around it somehow?
486. Não aceitar ser esquisito, não—mais tipo, hmm, reconhecer que o que parece esquisito pra você pode ser, meio que, seu estilo autêntico que ainda não achou seu ritmo, sabe, and that's completely workable.
Character 1: Às vezes eu me pergunto se [tosse] terapia poderia ajudar com essas coisas.
487. Terapia pode ser incrivelmente útil, na verdade, especialmente pra entender padrões e, é, desenvolver novas estratégias—cognitive behavioral therapy in particular has, enfim, ferramentas ótimas pra gradualmente mudar comportamentos trabalhando com seu temperamento em vez de contra ele.
Character 1: É, mas, tipo, como eu sei se tô mudando pelos motivos certos, I mean, versus just trying to, é, agradar outras pessoas?
488. Essa é uma distinção super importante de fazer. Mudança real e duradoura vem de motivação interna—when you can clearly articulate why YOU want something different, não porque outra pessoa acha que você deveria ser diferente.
Character 1: Minha família fica dizendo que eu preciso ser [bem alto] mais ambicioso com tudo!
489. Famílias projetam seus próprios medos e aspirações, honestly, mas ambição parece diferente pra cada um—algumas pessoas querem, tipo, subir escadas corporativas enquanto outras, bem, encontram realização em maestria, criatividade, ou equilíbrio de vida, and all of those are equally valid paths.
Character 1: Acho que eu preciso descobrir o que [espirro] eu realmente quero então.
490. Exatamente, e é aí que, umm, o trabalho real começa—sentar com você mesmo tempo suficiente pra [pausa longa] distinguir entre seus desejos autênticos e, sabe, todos os "deveria" que você internalizou de outras pessoas.
Character 1: Então, fiquei sabendo que você tá [brincalhão] quase terminando as revisões do PEI desse trimestre?
491. Ah sim, é, já completei uns 85% delas, meio que adiantado no cronograma, pra falar a verdade! Tínhamos 28 alunos pra revisar dessa vez, sabe, e já terminei 24, o que é uma baita conquista considerando tudo mais que tá rolando.
Character 1: Que incrível! Quanto tempo leva cada uma normalmente?
492. Bom, cada revisão leva [encantado] mais ou menos umas 2 a 3 horas quando você conta, é, a documentação, as consultas com os pais, e atualizar todos os objetivos e adaptações—mas sinceramente, ver o progresso das crianças faz valer cada minuto!
Character 1: Você acompanha o progresso deles com métricas específicas?
493. Com certeza, a gente usa múltiplos pontos de [pausa] dados pra cada aluno. Pra fluência de leitura, medimos palavras por minuto semanalmente, e pra matemática acompanhamos a precisão na resolução de problemas em 10 áreas de habilidades diferentes—isso dá uma visão super completa de onde cada criança está.
Character 1: Nossa, é, isso parece [bem alto] MUITOS dados pra gerenciar, tipo, centenas de pontos de dados!
494. É bem extenso mesmo! Só no semestre passado coletei mais de 3.000 pontos de dados individuais pra toda minha turma, mas ter essas informações detalhadas me ajuda a defender exatamente o que cada aluno precisa.
Character 1: Eu tô [muito sinceramente] impressionado com o quanto você se dedica a isso.
495. Ah, [suspiro suave] que gentileza você falar isso! Essa semana tô particularmente orgulhoso porque três dos meus alunos atingiram as metas trimestrais antes do prazo—um melhorou seu nível de leitura em 1,5 séries em apenas 8 semanas!
Character 1: Hmm, que fantástico! Quantos alunos, quer dizer, você tem na sua turma no total?
496. Então, atualmente tenho 35 alunos, sinceramente, o que é meio acima do máximo recomendado de 28, mas cada um merece atenção individualizada. Passo umas 12 horas por semana em atendimento direto e outras 15 em planejamento e documentação.
Character 1: Isso é quase uma semana inteira de trabalho só nessas duas coisas!
497. É que também tem as reuniões—ahn, eu faço em média umas 4 conferências com pais e, sei lá, umas 6 reuniões de equipe por semana. Mas quando você vê uma criança que não conseguia ler de repente decodificar sua primeira frase, essas semanas de 60 horas valem totalmente a pena!
Character 1: Sessenta horas? [gemido] Fico exausto só de pensar nisso!
498. Pois é, pode ser intenso, mas sabe, dividir em partes ajuda—eu programo pausas de 15 minutos a cada 2 horas e protejo mesmo meu horário de almoço. Autocuidado não é egoísmo quando você apoia 35 famílias que dependem de você estar no seu melhor.
Character 1: Qual porcentagem dos seus alunos normalmente atinge as metas anuais?
499. Ano passado 78% dos meus alunos atingiram ou superaram as metas do PEI, o que ficou acima da média do distrito de 72%. Os outros 22% ainda fizeram progresso significativo, só precisaram de metas modificadas—cada criança tem seu próprio ritmo.
Character 1: São números realmente impressionantes!
500. Obrigado, foi uma baita jornada conseguir [aliviado] aumentar nossa taxa de sucesso de 65% três anos atrás! O acompanhamento consistente de dados, engajamento familiar, e colaboração com os professores do ensino regular fizeram toda a diferença—trabalho em equipe realmente funciona na educação especial.
Character 1: [baixinho] Eu posso te dizer exatamente, [tremendo], o que aconteceu em 17 de março de 2009 às 15h47, mas eu, é, não consigo lembrar, [sobrecarregado], se tomei café da manhã hoje ou, bem, como explicar por que isso importa.
501. [gentil] Sem pressa.
Character 1: [lutando] Os números tão, é, sempre ali, [frustrado], como um rádio que não desliga, e, é, às vezes eu me perco nos padrões até alguém, [distante], tocar meu ombro. [trails off]
502. [curioso] Você pode me ajudar a entender como é, [pensativo], quando os padrões tomam conta da sua, [cuidadoso], atenção desse jeito?
Character 1: [sincero] É como cair em, [searching], um oceano lindo onde cada gota é um cálculo, [mesmerized], e eu esqueço que existe uma superfície pra respirar, [sem fôlego], até meus pulmões começarem a queimar.
503. Isso parece ao mesmo tempo extraordinário e, [preocupado], assustador. [soft exhale]
Character 1: [vulnerável] As pessoas acham que porque eu consigo calcular juros compostos de cabeça eu deveria, [amargo], conseguir lembrar de pagar minhas contas.
504. [compreensivo] O dom e o desafio não são, [recognizing], coisas separadas né—they're woven together in ways that, [compassivo], a maioria das pessoas não consegue ver. [pausa]
Character 1: [aliviado] Sim, exatamente, é como ter visão perfeita mas, [emocionado], só conseguir ver fractais onde outras pessoas veem rostos, [voz embargada], e ninguém entende por que eu não consigo simplesmente, [desesperado], olhar normalmente.
505. [gentil] Na sua aplicação você mencionou dificuldade com, [reading], rotinas diárias, but you can recall every stock price from, [impressed], a última década.
Character 1: [defensivo] Bem, preços de ações são, é, padrões que seguem regras, mas, é, saber quando tomar banho ou quanto tempo manter contato visual—essas são, [confuso], construções sociais arbitrárias que mudam com contexto e, é, eu não consigo calcular a resposta correta.
506. [pensativo] Então pra você, as relações matemáticas complexas são na verdade, [percebendo], mais simples do que o que a maioria considera interações sociais básicas, [contemplative], é isso? [suave]
Character 1: [ansioso] Exatamente, eu consigo prever flutuações de mercado baseado em, [intenso], 17 variáveis diferentes simultaneamente, mas não consigo prever se o sorriso de alguém significa que tá, [ansioso], feliz ou só sendo educado. [sighs deeply]
507. [caloroso] Sabe, em todos os meus anos fazendo isso, [reflexivo], I've never had someone explain it quite so clearly—the way extraordinary ability can, [compreensivo], existir junto com desafios profundos que a maioria das pessoas considera, [moved], normais. [pausa]
Character 1: [esperançoso] É, então você acredita em mim, que eu, bem, preciso de ajuda mesmo com meu QI sendo, é, whatever those tests say it is, [vulnerável], porque os números não contam a história de me perder no meu próprio bairro quando as folhas mudam de cor e, é, bagunçam os padrões que eu uso, [voz falhando], pra navegar?
508. [sincero] Eu mais que acredito em você—é, acho que seu depoimento hoje, bem, me ajudou a entender algo fundamental sobre, [tocado], como definimos deficiência e habilidade, sabe? [emocionado]
Character 1: [sussurrado] Obrigado.
509. Bem, o que eu tô vendo é alguém que experimenta o mundo através de, é, uma lente completamente diferente, e, é, that lens brings both remarkable insights and, er, desafios reais.
Character 1: Na maioria dos dias eu queria poder desligar isso, [exausto], ver o mundo do jeito que todo mundo vê, maybe then I could remember, [melancólico], ligar pra minha mãe no aniversário dela.
510. [compassivo] Bem, eu vou, é, aprovar sua aplicação, e, é, quero que você saiba que não é por pena mas por, [firme], reconhecimento de que seus desafios são tão reais quanto seus, bem, dons são extraordinários. [decisive]
Character 1: [em pânico] Tommy, puta merda, é, que porra que cê tá, [tremendo], fazendo aqui na área de carga restrita—cê não devia estar nem perto, [sem fôlego], das docas de carregamento, quer dizer, a Sarah vai me matar.
511. [fraco] Não consigo respirar direito.
Character 1: [urgente] Não tenta se mexer porque aquele contêiner, [horrorizado], deslocou umas duas toneladas de vigas de aço e eu tô vendo sangue se acumulando embaixo do seu, [tremendo], ombro esquerdo o que significa que alguma coisa definitivamente rasgou ou, [voz embargada], quebrou aí dentro.
512. A Sarah não, [ofegante], sabe que eu vim aqui pra falar com você sobre o dinheiro.
Character 1: [confuso] Que dinheiro—Tommy, esquece seja lá o que cê tá, [frustrado], falando porque agora a gente precisa focar em te manter, [firme], consciente até os paramédicos passarem pelo posto de segurança.
513. Os 30 mil, hum, que o pai me deixou em vez da Sarah, bom, eu ia, [culpado], dar pra vocês dois pro bebê mas eu queria, [lutando], te contar primeiro antes dela descobrir que ele, [amargo], me escolheu. [tosse úmida]
Character 1: [atônito] Seu pai tá morto há seis meses e cê ficou, [descrente], carregando isso esse tempo todo? [pausa longa]
514. [sumindo] Eu sei, é, o quanto vocês dois precisavam, principalmente com as demissões vindo.
Character 1: [gentil] Escuta, o dinheiro não, [sincero], importa agora porque o que importa é que você vai ficar bem e a gente vai, [tranquilizador], passar por isso juntos como sempre, [voz embargada], fazemos como família.
515. [delirante] Quer dizer, a Sarah sempre disse que eu era o preferido, hum, mesmo quando éramos crianças, e acho que, [vazio], o pai provou que ela tava certa no final deixando tudo pra mim enquanto ela ficou com, [voz sumindo], nada além da caminhonete velha dele. [ofegante]
Character 1: [desesperado] Tommy, é, fica comigo aqui, tipo, suas pupilas tão ficando estranhas e, [assustado], isso não é bom—fala comigo sobre qualquer coisa, só continua, [suplicante], falando.
516. [divagando] Lembra quando, hum, a gente foi pescar naquele verão antes de você casar com ela, e, bom, você pegou aquele robalo enorme e a Sarah, [sorriso fraco], caiu no lago tentando pegar ele com a rede?
Character 1: Sim, quer dizer, ela culpou você por balançar o barco mas, é, todo mundo sabia que ela só, [afetuoso], ficou empolgada demais por finalmente pegar algo maior do que, [riso suave], o pai dela já tinha pegado, e ela voltou à superfície, [calorosamente], rindo tanto que nem conseguiu ficar brava. [suspira]
517. [divagando] Ela parecia tão, ah, feliz naquele dia, antes de tudo ficar complicado com, bom, o pai ficando doente e o testamento e eu, [arrependido], sendo covarde demais pra contar pra ela sobre o dinheiro enquanto ele ainda tava, [pesado], vivo quando talvez a gente pudesse ter, hum, resolvido isso.
Character 1: [firme] Você não é covarde, você é só, [protetor], alguém que ama demais a irmã pra machucar ela mesmo quando, [compreensivo], ser honesto teria sido mais fácil.
518. [chorando] Mas eu machuquei ela guardando segredos e agora ela vai, [angustiado], descobrir quando eu tô sangrando num armazém e ela vai pensar que eu vim aqui pra, [desesperado], te contar pelas costas dela em vez de só ser, [quebrado], corajoso o bastante pra encarar ela.
Character 1: [tranquilizador] Tommy, ah, cê não tá sangrando até morrer, tá, porque eu já tô ouvindo as sirenes e, hum, eles vão te consertar e depois a gente vai, [determinado], sentar todo mundo junto e resolver isso.
519. [fraco] Me promete que se, bom, alguma coisa acontecer, você vai contar pra ela que eu tava vindo pra, hum, acertar as coisas, que o dinheiro sempre foi, [urgente], pra vocês dois e pro bebê, não uma, [enfraquecendo], última jogada idiota de poder do pai. [respiração curta]
Character 1: [feroz] Nada vai acontecer porque, é, você mesmo vai contar pra ela, e tipo, ela provavelmente vai chorar e gritar e depois, [carinhoso], te abraçar até você não conseguir respirar, como sempre.
520. [sussurrado] Os paramédicos chegaram e, hum, tá ficando tudo bem, [tranquilo], claro e quieto agora, tipo aquela manhã no lago antes dos, [distante], peixes começarem a morder e a gente só ficou boiando lá, ah, sentindo que tudo ia ficar, [sereno], bem pra sempre. [expira devagar]
Character 1: [nervoso] Um, I wasn't expecting, well...
521. [surpreso] You look, um, really familiar like I've, [searching], seen you somewhere before but I mean, not recently.
Character 1: [quiet] Franklin High School.
522. The kid with the, [atônito], thick glasses and braces who always ate, [remembering], lunch alone in the library because everyone called you, [arrependido], names and threw things at your head. [pausa longa]
Character 1: That was me twenty years ago before the, [amargo], surgeries and therapy sessions and learning how to, [pausado], pretend I belonged in rooms where people, [vazio], actually looked at me without laughing.
523. [envergonhado] I remember.
Character 1: [tremendo] You were one of the worst ones who'd, [zangado], follow me home throwing rocks and calling me, [voz falhando], hideous while your friends recorded it on their, [choked], phones for everyone to watch later.
524. [pesado] Well, I, um, ended up here working in corrections after, [culpado], my own stint on the other side of these, [mais baixo], bars for assault charges when I was, [voz sumindo], nineteen.
Character 1: [descrente] The golden boy quarterback who had, [sarcástico], everything handed to him on a silver platter went, [atônito], to prison and now works as a, [processing], guard? [laughs darkly]
525. [honest] Yeah, well, turns out being popular in high school, [reflexivo], doesn't mean much when you're detoxing in a cell, um, wondering how you became exactly the kind of person you know, your mother warned you about.
Character 1: [mais suave] My brother's the one I'm here visiting today after, [cuidadoso], three years of him being inside.
526. I know, um, this doesn't mean anything now but I've thought about you, [arrependido], every single day since I got clean and realized how much, [voz embargada], pain I must have caused you back then. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [firme] Well, you're right that it doesn't erase anything but I mean, seeing you here in this uniform instead of, [contemplative], on some pedestal makes me realize we both, [mais baixo], ended up somewhere different than anyone, um, expected.
527. [sincero] If I could go back and protect that, [dolorido], scared kid in the library from myself and everyone else—
Character 1: [interrupting] But you can't, and I mean, that scared kid had to save herself which, well, made me stronger than, [orgulhoso], any of you ever were. [pausa]
528. [aceitando] You became everything we said you'd, [admirando], never be while we became nothing. [suspira]
Character 1: [resoluto] I, um, spent years in therapy learning that your cruelty was never actually, [compreensivo], about me but about whatever darkness lived inside, well, you.
529. [sussurrado] You're right. [cries]
Character 1: [unexpected warmth] Maybe we both needed to break completely before we, [filosófico], could rebuild into people who actually understand what, [gentil], real strength looks like instead of just, [pensativo], pretending.
530. [grato] Um, thank you, I mean—
Character 1: [atônito] Preciso que o veterinário sênior examine meu cavalo, não algum, [desdenhoso], técnico que claramente não entende o valor de linhagens campeãs.
531. [frio] O veterinário sênior está ocupado, [controlado], e eu sou perfeitamente capaz de examinar seu, [amargo], precioso investimento sem precisar entender seu, [cortante], valor monetário pro senhor. [suspira]
Character 1: [chocado] Rafael?
532. [tenso] Sim pai, sou eu, [defensivo], o filho que jogou fora o diploma de direito pra, [sarcástico], desperdiçar a vida brincando com animais como você disse tão eloquentemente, [cansado], há 3 anos atrás.
Character 1: Bom, quer dizer, eu não sabia que você estava, hum, trabalhando aqui senão eu teria, [envergonhado], ido pra outra clínica, obviamente.
533. [magoado] Obviamente, porque Deus me livre você ter que, [zangado], encarar a decepção de um filho que escolheu curar em vez de, [amargo], litigância corporativa.
Character 1: [mais baixo] Seu cavalo na verdade tem uma infecção grave que vem, [preocupado], piorando há semanas apesar do que seu veterinário regular disse.
534. Hum, os marcadores de inflamação estão, bom, nas alturas e, [clínico], sem tratamento imediato, você vai ter, [sério], claudicação permanente ou pior, e tipo, [mais suave], não tô dizendo isso pra te machucar. [pausa]
Character 1: [desesperado] Olha, hum, eu sei que a gente não se, [lutando], fala desde que você saiu do escritório, mas é, por favor, [suplicante], ajuda o Trovão porque eu não ligo mais pro dinheiro. [voz embargada]
535. Bom, quer dizer, é meu trabalho ajudar todo animal que, [profissional], passa por essas portas independente de, hum, quem traz eles.
Character 1: [vulnerável] Eu sei, é... eu estava errado sobre sua escolha de carreira e, bom, ver você aqui sendo tão, [admirando], competente e cuidadoso me faz perceber isso.
536. [aquecendo] Pai, hum, você me ensinou a nunca desistir de algo que eu, [emocionado], amava, mesmo que, bom, você quisesse dizer direito corporativo e não, [mais leve], medicina veterinária. [risinho]
Character 1: [arrependido] Bom, eu passei 3 anos, hum, convencido de que você estava jogando sua vida fora, [envergonhado], quando na verdade você estava só, é, encontrando um jeito diferente de usar sua genialidade, e tipo, [orgulhoso], olha você agora. [suspira pesadamente]
537. [gentil] O Trovão precisa de cirurgia nas próximas 12 horas e eu sou, [firme], o técnico assistente, o que significa que você vai ter que, [significativo], confiar em mim.
Character 1: [firme] Eu passei por três outras clínicas pra vir aqui porque, [admitindo], apesar de tudo, eu sabia que você trabalhava aqui e, [emocionado], eu queria ver quem você se tornou sem eu tentando, [arrependido], controlar seu caminho.
538. [surpreso] Você sabia que eu estava aqui e mesmo assim, [tocado], veio mesmo que, bom, a gente não se fala desde aquela briga terrível sobre a oferta de sociedade.
Character 1: [aceitando] O Trovão não é só um investimento, ele é o cavalo que você, [nostálgico], montava todo verão antes da faculdade de direito.
539. Meu Deus, eu não reconheci ele porque ele, [choroso], emagreceu tanto, mas hum, claro que vou fazer tudo, é, pra salvar ele, pai. [chorando baixinho]
Character 1: [suave] Talvez depois da cirurgia, hum, a gente pudesse conversar sobre, [esperançoso], bom, tudo que devíamos ter conversado há anos em vez de, [arrependido], deixar o orgulho destruir o que tínhamos. [pausa longa]
540. Eu gostaria disso, e hum, talvez você pudesse finalmente ver que essa, [orgulhoso], escolha de carreira não foi sobre rejeitar você mas, bom, sobre me encontrar. [suspira]
Character 1: [shaky] I found this storage unit key in my, [sobrecarregado], mother's safety deposit box and when I opened it yesterday, there were just, [perplexo], thousands of these old movie things everywhere.
541. [gentil] These aren't just, um, old movie things, they're, [reverent], pieces from the Golden Age studios that, well, collectors have been searching for, [admirado], for decades, I mean, this is extraordinary.
Character 1: [confuso] So, um, my mother never mentioned anything about, [searching], collecting props and I don't understand why she'd, well, keep all this hidden from everyone.
542. [cuidadoso] Your mother's name wouldn't happen to be, [esperançoso], Eleanor Westbrook, would it, because that's the anonymous donor who's been, [empolgado], preserving cinema history for forty years.
Character 1: She was just a librarian who loved old movies and, [voz embargada], never traveled anywhere or had money for, [choroso], this kind of collection.
543. [suave] Sometimes the most unassuming people are the, [sabendo], greatest guardians of history, and your mother saved pieces that studios were literally, [apaixonado], throwing in dumpsters during the seventies.
Character 1: [tremendo] All those nights she said she was working late at the, [percebendo], library, she must have been rescuing these things from being destroyed.
544. I've been searching for, um, the Casablanca airport beacon for, [emocionado], fifteen years to complete our memorial exhibit, and it's right here.
Character 3: [sem fôlego] You mean she saved the actual, well, beacon from the final scene, because, [atônito], that's supposedly been lost since 1974 and, um, Rick's goodbye to Ilsa wouldn't exist without it, [choked up], symbolically speaking.
545. [carinhoso] That's exactly what she saved.
Character 1: [chorando baixinho] She used to quote that movie to me constantly, saying we'll always, [nostálgico], have Paris even when she was dying, and now I understand she was, [voz falhando], preserving something beautiful for the world.
546. The museum would be honored to, [respectful], display her collection with full attribution, finally giving her the, [sincero], recognition she deserves.
Character 1: [sussurrado] Really?
547. Every piece here tells a story and your, [caloroso], mother made sure those stories wouldn't be forgotten, which is the most noble thing, [admirando], any collector can do.
Character 1: [grato] I spent my whole career making things go viral for twenty-four hours while she was, [humbled], quietly preserving things that would matter for generations, and I never even knew.
548. [apoiando] Well, now you can, um, use those marketing skills to, [encorajador], tell her story the way it deserves to be told.
Character 1: [determinado] We could create a whole campaign around the, [inspirado], secret guardian of cinema history, showing how one librarian saved what Hollywood threw away, [orgulhoso], making her legacy immortal. [sniffles]
549. [moved] That's exactly what she would have wanted, not fame for herself but, [pensativo], preservation of the art she loved so deeply.
Character 1: [suave] So, um, where do we start with cataloging all this, because I mean, [sobrecarregado], there must be thousands of pieces here and I don't even know what, well, half of them are.
550. [tranquilizador] We'll do this together, piece by piece, and um, every single item will be treated with the, [reverent], respect your mother showed when she saved them, because well, [emocionado], this is her life's work and her gift to the world. [voz embargada]
Character 1: [distante] Sabe, é... eu tô olhando pra esse whiskey há, [sobrecarregado], vinte minutos tentando entender se, bom, o que eu descobri hoje muda tudo ou, quer dizer, não muda nada.
551. [observador] Olha, é... em trinta anos cuidando de bar, eu vi esse, [sabendo], olhar específico umas três vezes só—o olhar de alguém que, [gentil], descobriu algo que não vai deixar dormir, sabe, algo que reescreve a, [cuidadoso], história que achava que conhecia.
Character 1: [vazio] Muda tudo.
552. A maioria das pessoas que sentam onde você tá, [curioso], sentado tá fugindo de alguma coisa, mas você, bom, você parece que tá correndo em direção a algo que não tá, [perceptivo], pronto pra alcançar ainda, sabe o que eu quero dizer? [ri baixinho]
Character 1: [tremendo] Amanhã de manhã o mundo inteiro vai saber sobre as, [sem fôlego], ruínas que eu encontrei a 8 mil pés abaixo da superfície do Pacífico—estruturas que não deveriam, [descrente], existir de acordo com tudo que achávamos que sabíamos.
553. Ruínas tão antigas e tão fundas significariam que nosso, [fascinado], entendimento inteiro da história humana precisa ser reescrito do zero. [assobia baixo]
Character 1: [confuso] É, hum, mas é isso né, quer dizer, elas não são só antigas—são, [assombrado], impossivelmente sofisticadas, tipo, sabe, quem construiu elas entendia coisas que a gente tá só começando a compreender agora.
554. Parece que você encontrou algo que faz você, [pensativo], questionar se somos tão avançados quanto gostamos de, [filosófico], pensar que somos, né, quer dizer deve ser, bom, aterrorizante e emocionante ao mesmo tempo. [suspira]
Character 1: [intenso] As gravuras nas paredes mostram padrões de estrelas que não vão, [admirado], aparecer no nosso céu por mais 2 mil anos—como eles poderiam, [tremendo], possivelmente saber disso sem tecnologia que a gente nem, [desesperado], tem ainda?
555. [pausado] Sabe, é... minha avó costumava dizer que, [sábio], cada geração acha que é a primeira a descobrir o fogo, mas, bom, talvez a gente só tá, [reflexivo], redescobrindo o que foi perdido, sabe, encontrando nosso caminho de volta pra algo, [místico], esquecido em vez de ir pra frente pra algo novo.
Character 1: Quer dizer, e se a gente não for a primeira civilização avançada nesse planeta, é, e se formos só a, [amargo], mais recente num ciclo que vem se repetindo há, bom, mais tempo do que conseguimos imaginar?
556. Hum, pesado, né.
Character 1: A pressão lá embaixo esmagaria um corpo humano em, [clínico], segundos, mas essas estruturas mostram sinais de terem sido habitadas por, [perplexo], séculos por algo que conseguia sobreviver a isso.
557. [gentil] Olha, eu não sei muito sobre, é, arqueologia submarina ou civilizações antigas, mas eu conheço esse, [apoiando], olhar nos seus olhos—você tá carregando algo que é grande demais pra uma pessoa, [compreensivo], aguentar sozinha, e bom, é por isso que você tá aqui falando com um estranho em vez de, sabe, celebrando com colegas. [pausa]
Character 1: [voz falhando] É, eu só—quer dizer, é. [exala]
558. [inspirador] O negócio com descobertas que mudam o mundo é que elas não, [encorajador], mudam o mundo de uma vez—elas mudam uma pessoa primeiro, depois, [crescendo], se espalham como ondas de uma pedra jogada em água parada até que eventualmente toda a, [profundo], superfície fica diferente. [sorri]
Character 1: [vulnerável] Hum, eu fico pensando em como, bom, quem construiu essas ruínas provavelmente achava que a civilização deles duraria pra sempre também, sabe, e agora são só, [melancólico], mistérios lindos sob profundidades impossíveis de água.
559. Talvez essa seja a verdadeira descoberta—não as ruínas em si mas o, [pensativo], lembrete de que nada que construímos é permanente, que toda grande civilização vira, [poético], sítio arqueológico de outra pessoa eventualmente, e tem algo quase, [tranquilo], reconfortante nessa impermanência.
Character 1: [resoluto] Amanhã vou ficar na frente da mídia mundial e mostrar pra eles, [ganhando confiança], prova de que tudo que achávamos que sabíamos sobre nossas origens é incompleto, que existem, [inspirado], mistérios que ainda valem a pena mergulhar na escuridão pra encontrar.
560. E hoje à noite você tá sentado no meu bar, [compreensivo], só mais uma pessoa lutando com o peso do conhecimento, tentando fazer as, [compassivo], pazes com uma verdade grande demais pra palavras antes de ter que encontrar as, [gentil], palavras pra compartilhar mesmo assim.
Character 1: [áspero] Sabe, hum, eu descobri algo realmente, [acusatório], perturbador sobre aqueles tacos que você vem, bom, me vendendo e, [tremendo], pra todos os outros caddies desse circuito nos, quer dizer, últimos cinco anos. [expira bruscamente]
561. Olha, hum, o que você acha que, [defensivo], sabe sobre meu negócio, é, você entendeu tudo errado e, [nervoso], eu posso explicar tudo se você só, bom, me der uma chance aqui. [suspira]
Character 1: [amargo] Hum, é mesmo?
562. [derrotado] Bom, quer dizer, tá bom.
Character 1: [furioso] 3 dos meus clientes foram, hum, desqualificados de torneios importantes porque os tacos que você me vendeu, [voz embargada], não atendiam aos padrões regulamentares e agora, é, as carreiras deles estão basicamente, [tremendo], acabadas porque eu confiei em você. [geme]
563. Os fabricantes me disseram que eram, [desesperado], legítimos e eu não tinha motivo pra duvidar deles depois de, [voz falhando], 10 anos nesse ramo.
Character 1: [frio] Você quer que eu acredite que não tinha ideia de que tava vendendo, [sarcástico], equipamento falsificado quando você vendia pela, [incrédulo], metade do preço de mercado?
564. A economia tá difícil e as pessoas precisavam de, [lutando], opções acessíveis então eu achei um fornecedor que podia, [mais baixo], ajudá-las a continuar no esporte.
Character 1: [cortante] Opções acessíveis que destruíram a capacidade delas de, [amargo], jogar profissionalmente de novo.
565. [quebrado] Olha, hum, eu nunca quis machucar ninguém, quer dizer, eu só tava tentando, [engasgando], sobreviver aqui como todo mundo, sabe?
Character 1: Bom, hum, sobreviver às custas dos, [enojado], sonhos e sustento dos outros não é só errado, é, é, criminoso e você sabe, [feroz], eu já contatei os oficiais do torneio sobre toda essa bagunça.
566. [em pânico] Espera, por favor não faz isso—eu tenho, [suplicante], 2 filhos pra sustentar e se isso vazar, [voz embargada], vou perder tudo pelo que trabalhei. [soluçando]
Character 1: [conflitado] Seus filhos não são mais importantes que as, [firme], carreiras que você arruinou com suas mentiras.
567. [desesperado] Eu posso consertar isso de alguma forma, [frenético], devolvendo o dinheiro de todo mundo e testemunhando que eles não sabiam que os tacos eram, [voz falhando], falsos então talvez eles possam recorrer das desqualificações. [chorando]
Character 1: [exausto] Recursos não vão trazer de volta os patrocínios que eles perderam ou o, [vazio], dano à reputação que os segue em todo campo agora, [derrotado], e você sabe disso tão bem quanto eu. [pausa longa]
568. Então, hum, o que acontece agora—eu só, é, fico esperando as autoridades, [tremendo], aparecerem na minha porta, quer dizer?
Character 1: As autoridades já estão a caminho porque isso é, [sombrio], maior do que só você e eu agora.
569. Eu sei, hum, que você me odeia agora mas preciso que você, [desesperado], entenda que eu nunca quis que nada disso, bom, acontecesse.
Character 1: [cansado] A intenção não importa quando o estrago já está, [final], feito e vidas foram destruídas—você me ensinou isso, [vazio], ironicamente, quando me vendeu meu primeiro conjunto dizendo que, [amargo], integridade era tudo nesse esporte.
570. [derrotado] É, bom, acho que nós dois aprendemos que, hum, integridade é um luxo que alguns de nós, [envergonhado], não podem pagar quando estamos desesperados o bastante pra, é, acreditar nas próprias mentiras sobre, [quebrado], só tentar ajudar as pessoas. [suspira pesadamente]
Character 1: [atônito] Eu vim aqui pra salvar esse teatro com uma, [engolindo em seco], doação de dois milhões de dólares mas nunca esperava ver, [voz caindo], você atrás dessa mesa depois de todos esses anos.
571. [frio] O filantropo que quer resgatar nosso teatrinho comunitário é, [riso amargo], a mesma pessoa que não conseguiu resgatar nosso casamento.
Character 1: [defensivo] Bom, é... isso não é justo porque, quer dizer, nós dois sabemos que tinha, [dolorido], motivos pra as coisas terminarem do jeito que, ahm, [voz sumindo], terminaram naquela época.
572. [frustrado] Você tá certo, é, tinha motivos sim como você, [acusatório], escolher salvar o mundo em vez de, bom, [voz embargada], escolher salvar a gente quando mais precisava, sabe, [exala], quando mais precisava.
Character 1: [ansioso] Olha, quer dizer, eu tô aqui agora oferecendo, [sincero], financiar a temporada inteira de vocês, é, todas as produções, todos os salários, tudo que vocês precisarem.
573. [cético] Você sempre achou que dinheiro podia, [resignado], resolver tudo, até as coisas que nunca foram sobre dinheiro. [suspira]
Character 1: [sussurrado] Bom, é... eu sei.
574. [suavizando] Esse teatro tem sido minha, [emocionado], vida inteira desde que você foi embora, a única coisa que, [voz embargada], me manteve de pé quando todo o resto desmoronou, [baixinho], desmoronou.
Character 1: [sincero] Eu doei milhões pra causas no mundo todo mas, [engasgando], nada disso preencheu o vazio que, [quase inaudível], perder você criou.
575. [surpreso] Sério?
Character 1: [desesperado] Cada gala beneficente, é, cada inauguração, quer dizer, eu ficava esperando que talvez, [esperançoso], você aparecesse, que de algum jeito nossos, bom, [melancólico], caminhos se cruzassem de novo e a gente pudesse, ahm, conversar.
576. [tremendo] Sabe, é... eu fui numa das suas, [envergonhado], festas três anos atrás mas eu, bom, [voz caindo], não consegui me aproximar de você, quer dizer, não depois de tudo.
Character 1: O beneficente do Hospital Infantil, é, com aquele, [percebendo], vestido azul que você usou no nosso jantar de aniversário, quer dizer, [sobrecarregado], eu vi você ir embora.
577. [chocado] Você me viu naquela noite e você, [magoado], não disse nada, nem sequer, [acusatório], tentou me impedir de ir embora? [pausa longa]
Character 1: [gentil] Bom, eu pensei, é, se você quisesse conversar você teria, [triste], ficado, sabe, não desaparecido na chuva daquele jeito.
578. Eu fiquei naquela chuva por, é, [chorando baixinho], vinte minutos esperando você vir atrás de mim, quer dizer, [quebrado], rezando pra você me seguir do jeito que você, bom, costumava fazer.
Character 1: [ansioso] Então, é, talvez essa seja nossa chance de, [esperançoso], recomeçar, não como o que éramos mas como algo novo.
579. O teatro precisa desesperadamente desse dinheiro mas aceitar de você parece, [conflitado], abrir uma porta que eu passei cinco anos aprendendo a manter fechada.
Character 1: [sincero] Olha, eu não tô pedindo pra você abrir porta nenhuma, é, só pra, [gentil], me deixar ajudar a salvar algo que você ama.
580. [choroso] Você quer saber a, é, [lutando], verdade sobre por que eu realmente trabalho aqui, bom, [desmoronando], é porque a gente teve nosso primeiro encontro nesse teatro, quer dizer, [sussurrado], assistindo aquela produção terrível de Romeu e Julieta. [chora baixinho]
Character 1: [agitated] Olha, é, eu tô tentando te alcançar há, [desesperado], 3 semanas sobre os resultados de carbon dating que você encontrou na, [urgente], propriedade dos Miller porque meu cliente tá sentado na prisão há 7 anos por um homicídio que, [voz falhando], supostamente aconteceu lá. [expira bruscamente]
581. [defensivo] O protocolo da universidade exige que eu publique minhas descobertas através de, [cuidadoso], revisão por pares antes de liberar qualquer coisa pra, [desdenhoso], advogados que podem interpretar mal evidência arqueológica.
Character 1: [frustrado] Bom, quer dizer, você percebe que, [incrédulo], um homem inocente tá apodrecendo enquanto você tá preocupado com, [amargo], cronogramas de publicação acadêmica, né?
582. [quiet] É, bom, eu não sabia.
Character 1: [suplicante] Então, é, a promotoria alegou que o corpo foi enterrado lá em 2017, mas sabe, suas descobertas sugerem que, [esperançoso], o solo não foi perturbado por décadas. [suspira]
583. [atônito] Na verdade, é, é mais que isso porque, bom, os depósitos minerais mostram que, [growing interest], nothing larger than a rabbit has been buried there since the 1960s. [pausa]
Character 1: [intenso] Essa evidência poderia literalmente salvar a vida dele e reunir ele com a, [choked up], filha dele que mal lembra mais dele.
584. [conflitado] Quer dizer, é, eu tô tão focado na significância histórica que eu, bom, não considerei o, [culpado], custo humano dos meus atrasos.
Character 1: [mais suave] Todo perito que eu consultei diz que sua metodologia é a mais, [sincero], precisa no campo agora mesmo. [pausa longa]
585. [resolved] Sabe, é, eu tenho o relatório completo com, [determinado], todos os pontos de dados e evidência fotográfica que poderia, bom, provar que a linha do tempo da promotoria é, [confident], fisicamente impossível.
Character 1: [chocado] Você tá dizendo que tem prova definitiva que poderia, [sobrecarregado], derrubar essa condenação imediatamente e você ficou, [descrença], sentado em cima disso por meses enquanto a filha do meu cliente cresce sem, [voz embargada], o pai dela?
586. Bom, quer dizer, quando você coloca assim, é, as implicações éticas ficam, [envergonhado], crystal clear and I realize I've been prioritizing my career over, [arrependido], a liberdade real de alguém e, [voz falhando], a família dele. [suspira pesadamente]
Character 1: [urgente] Então, é, você pode testemunhar na audiência de apelação semana que vem porque, bom, o juiz precisa ouvir isso diretamente de, [desesperado], você?
587. [determinado] É, eu vou fazer mais que testemunhar porque, sabe, I'll provide every piece of evidence, every, [apaixonado], fotografia e medição que prova que essa condenação foi baseada em alegações impossíveis.
Character 1: [emocionado] Essa sua descoberta não é mais só sobre solo e minerais, é sobre, [choroso], restaurar a vida de um homem e devolver pra uma garotinha o, [voz falhando], pai dela depois de 7 anos de, [choked], separação injusta.
588. [committed] Bom, é, eu entendo agora que meu trabalho não é só sobre, [reflexivo], descobrir o passado mas sobre corrigir injustiças presentes. [determined pause]
Character 1: [grato] Sabe, é, eu tô lutando nesse caso sozinho há tanto tempo que, bom, ter alguém com sua expertise finalmente, [aliviado], acreditar na inocência dele significa, [emocionado], tudo.
589. [firme] Me diga exatamente o que você precisa de mim pra, [focused], consertar isso.
Character 1: [esperançoso] É, eu preciso do seu relatório completo, seu testemunho, e, bom, your willingness to stand by your findings mesmo quando a promotoria tentar, [firme], desacreditar você. [deep breath]
590. [resoluto] Bom, é, você vai ter tudo isso porque, sabe, a verdade enterrada naquele solo é mais, [apaixonado], importante que qualquer reconhecimento acadêmico que eu possa perder por ajudar, [determinado], você. [exala]
Character 1: [chocado] Ué, desculpa, mas o que você tá, [confuso], fazendo com o armário de louça da minha avó, quer dizer, aquele que ela, [tremendo], sempre disse que seria meu quando ela, bem, você sabe, [voz embargada], falecesse?
591. [awkward] Ah, é, desculpa, não sabia que alguém estaria aqui hoje—your sister hired me, é, [nervoso], pra avaliar tudo antes do leilão da semana que vem. [clears throat]
Character 1: [amargo] Claro que ela fez isso, quer dizer, é, ela sempre toma essas decisões sem, [magoado], me avisar ou avisar nosso irmão, como se a gente nem, [frustrado], existisse nessa família, sabe, just like when we were kids. [laughs bitterly]
592. [uncomfortable] Olha, é, eu vejo que isso é, [uncomfortable], uma situação difícil e não quero ficar, é, [hesitant], no meio de problemas de família aqui. [suspira]
Character 1: [quiet] É, bem, eu só—
593. [gentil] Olha, eu entendo como deve ser difícil ver um estranho, [sympathetic], mexendo nessas memórias preciosas, especially when you weren't, [cuidadoso], expecting it. [pausa]
Character 1: [defensivo] Você restaura antiguidades então deve ver isso o tempo todo—famílias, [voz falhando], brigando por coisas enquanto a pessoa que amava elas mal, [choked up], esfriou no túmulo. [voice cracks]
594. [resignado] Mais frequentemente do que eu gostaria de admitir, though that doesn't make it, [triste], any easier to witness cada vez que, [weary], acontece.
Character 1: [mais suave] É, eu costumava me esconder naquele armário quando era pequeno, sabe, [nostálgico], quando meus irmãos brigavam, e, bem, [distante], vovó sempre me encontrava lá.
595. [curioso] Ela devia ser especial pra você—quer dizer, é, pelo jeito que as coisas dela estão arrumadas aqui, [observador], everything tells a story, né?
Character 1: [emocionado] Ela foi a única que realmente me enxergava, não só como o, [dolorido], filho do meio que se perdia entre as conquistas da minha irmã e os, [voz falhando], problemas do meu irmão, but as myself. [starts crying]
596. [tentative] É, escuta, eu ainda não comecei o inventário oficial, então, bem, [tentative], maybe we could go through things together first? [gentilmente]
Character 1: [surpreso] Você faria isso mesmo com minha irmã te, [uncertain], pagando pra só catalogar tudo pro, [grato], leilão? [sniffles]
597. [pensativo] Às vezes preservar as histórias por trás dessas peças importa mais que, [sincero], seguir o contrato ao pé da letra, and clearly, [caloroso], your grandmother understood that. [suavemente]
Character 1: [choroso] É, tem uma caixinha de música no quarto dela que, bem, ela dava corda toda noite, [remembering], e eu não aguento pensar num estranho, [desesperado], comprando ela num leilão, sabe? [voz embargada]
598. [compreensivo] Bem, é, itens podem misteriosamente sumir dos inventários, é, [conspiratorial], especially small sentimental pieces que talvez tenham sido, [gentil], perdidas antes do avaliador chegar. [whispers]
Character 1: [grato] Eu te julguei mal quando entrei—você não é só, [envergonhado], um abutre catando as coisas dela. [exala]
599. [kind] É, bem, eu restauro coisas quebradas pra viver, então eu reconheço quando algo só precisa, [kind], de um pouco de cuidado em vez de ser substituído, sabe? [smiles sadly]
Character 1: [esperançoso] Talvez a gente pudesse começar pela sala de jantar onde ela fazia todos aqueles, [melancólico], almoços de domingo?
600. [caloroso] Eu adoraria isso—and you can tell me the stories enquanto, [encorajador], a gente trabalha.
601. [confuso] What's this? I don't—wait, is this addressed to me? Um, I haven't gotten actual mail in, like, forever. [pausa] "Dear Sarah, you probably don't remember me but..." [devagar] Oh my God, this is handwritten. Nobody does that anymore, right? [curioso] "...when you held the elevator for me last Tuesday and asked if I was okay..." Wait, I—[suspiro suave] I remember her. She was, you know, crying in the corner and I just... I mean, I didn't really do anything special. [caloroso] "You stayed with me for twenty minutes..." Did I? Honestly, I was just—er, it seemed like she needed someone. [voz trêmula] "I had just lost my job that morning and was going to..." [pausa] Oh. Oh no. [sussurrando] "...but your kindness reminded me that strangers can care." [fungar] I had no idea she was—I mean, the thing is, I was literally just killing time before my meeting. [chorando ao falar] "You saved me that day." I—[pausa longa] How do you not know? Like, how do you go through life not knowing you actually... [aliviado] She's okay now. Says she got a better job and—[riso] she named her rescue cat after me. [muito sinceramente] I just held a door. That's all I did.
602. [amargo] Sabe o que é engraçado? Aquela coisa toda, é... a reputação que basicamente destruiu minha carreira—o negócio é que, [sarcástico] todo mundo estava tão preocupado com meu "problema de imagem." [pausa] Não conseguia emprego em lugar nenhum, né? Tipo, vinte anos de experiência não significavam nada porque eu era o denunciante que, [frustrado], não sabia jogar o jogo.

Mas esses moleques? [caloroso] Eles realmente me escutam por causa disso. Quer dizer, ontem essa menina, ela tem uns 16 anos, basicamente me disse, [animado] "Você é o único adulto que entende—você realmente lutou contra o sistema." [risadinha] E eu fiquei ali pensando, pô, caramba.

[hesitante] É estranho como a coisa que me deixou, hum... inempregável no mundo corporativo é literalmente—[apaixonado] é exatamente o motivo pelo qual eles confiam em mim. Eles veem alguém que, sabe, não só seguiu as regras. [empaticamente] Alguém que foi derrubado e, honestamente, ficou no chão por um tempo.

[muito sinceramente] Quando eu falo pra eles sobre consequências, sobre fazer escolhas, eles sabem que eu não sou só, [voz sumindo]... algum adulto fazendo sermão. [empolgado] Eu já passei por isso, mais ou menos. Circunstâncias diferentes mas, [confiantemente] a mesma sensação do mundo inteiro contra você. [suspiro] E talvez essa reputação, sei lá... talvez ela tenha me levado exatamente onde eu precisava estar.
603. [ansioso] Tá, então, é... eu recebi a ligação ontem e simplesmente—cara, não consigo parar de pensar nisso. Tipo, isso é literalmente tudo que eu trabalhei pra conseguir, sabe? O emprego perfeito, a cidade que eu queria, tudo isso. [pausa] Mas o negócio é o seguinte, é... minha mãe tá piorando e eu não sei se consigo simplesmente... ir embora.

[frustrado] Porra, por que o timing tem que ser assim? Quer dizer, 5 anos atrás eu teria pulado nessa oportunidade sem nem—[suspiro] Mas agora? Meu pai não consegue cuidar dela sozinho, he's basically falling apart already. E minha irmã, bem, ela mora do outro lado do país então não é como se ela pudesse realmente ajudar.

[triste] Sabe o que me mata? Minha mãe na verdade ia querer que eu fosse. Ela ficaria furiosa se soubesse que eu tô considerando ficar por causa dela. [riso] Ela literalmente me disse semana passada—quando ela tava tendo um dia bom—ela falou "nem ouse colocar sua vida em espera por minha causa."

[voz trêmula] Mas como é que eu simplesmente... vou embora? Quer dizer, what if something happens and I'm not here? [bem baixinho] E se eu perder os últimos dias bons? [pausa] É, acho que eu já sei o que vou fazer. [resignado] I think I've known since the moment they called.
604. [exausto] Gente, eu simplesmente... nem consigo— [riso] a gente conseguiu, cara. Tipo, 23 anos que essa empresa tá funcionando e, hum, a gente nunca—nem uma vez—terminou antes da véspera de Natal. [empolgado] E hoje é só dia 20! [pausa breve] Quer dizer, sinceramente, quando a matriz disse que tínhamos 40 mil pedidos a mais que ano passado, eu pensei, bom, já era, né? A gente tá ferrado. [risadinha] Mas aí vocês todos simplesmente, [calorosamente], vocês se superaram de um jeito que eu— [voz sumindo]

[muito sinceramente] Eu tô fazendo isso há, o quê, 8 anos? E todo dezembro é tipo—sabe—caos total até literalmente o último segundo possível. [aliviado] Mas olha pra gente! O armazém tá, é, vazio mesmo. [riso alto] Vazio! Quando que isso já aconteceu em dezembro? [encantado] Os filhos da Sarah vão, quer dizer, eles vão conseguir jantar com ela hoje. E Tom, [falando sorrindo] você não disse que não conseguia ir na apresentação de Natal da sua filha há, hum, 3 anos?

[emocionado] Eu fico andando por aí esperando ver, sei lá, tipo, mais um palete de pedidos em algum lugar, mas não tem— [suspiro suave] não tem nada. A gente terminou. [extremamente feliz] A gente terminou mesmo, e, hmm, eu acho que eu vou— [choro] desculpa, é que eu tô muito— [gargalhada] a gente conseguiu!
605. [empolgado] Caraca, tá acontecendo mesmo—Atlantic Records quer assinar com a gente! Tipo, um contrato de verdade, não é qualquer gravadora indie que ninguém conhece. [riso] Eu fico relendo o email toda hora porque, tipo, não consigo acreditar que isso é real. [ansioso] Mas o negócio é o seguinte—eles querem a gente em turnê em 2 meses, which means I'd have to quit at the firm. Largar tudo mesmo. Tipo, [devagar], sair de 6 anos de estabilidade, plano de saúde, meu 401k...

[suspiro] Meu pai vai surtar quando eu contar que tô deixando um emprego de 70 mil pra tocar em barzinho pelo país. E sinceramente? [hesitante] E se a gente for só mais uma banda que eles largam depois de um álbum? E se eu—what if this is the biggest mistake of my life?

[pausa]

Mas aí eu penso em ficar sentado naquele cubículo por mais 20 anos, sabe, watching other people live their dreams on Spotify enquanto eu fico arquivando relatório trimestral. [apaixonadamente] A gente tá tocando "Bohemian Rhapsody" em casamento faz 5 anos, and now we get to write our own songs, nossa própria música de verdade!

[confiantemente] Eu tenho 31 anos. Se não for agora, quando? [bem baixinho] Acho que eu tenho que fazer isso. [smile speaking] Não—I know I have to do this.
606. [confuso] Eu nunca pensei—quer dizer, quem abre uma loja de furar bola de boliche esperando, sabe, ISSO? [risadinha] Era pra ser só eu, umas furadeiras, e talvez, uh, um cliente ocasional que precisasse ajustar os buracos dos dedos. [caloroso] Mas agora é tipo—honestly, I walk in every morning and já tem gente aqui. [pausa] Metade das vezes nem são clientes.

[animado] O Joe traz donuts toda terça, né? E, um, a Martha fica tricotando naquela cadeira do canto enquanto a bola dela é polida—[riso] ela nem joga mais boliche! [devagar] O negócio é que, em algum momento, isso simplesmente... virou outra coisa. [feliz] Os moleques fazem lição de casa no balcão depois da escola, e eu tô lá, ajudando com álgebra entre um serviço e outro. [pausa breve] Eu! Álgebra!

[muito sinceramente] Semana passada, quando a mulher do Tommy deixou ele, ele ficou sentado aqui por, sei lá, 3 horas? [empaticamente] A gente nem falou sobre boliche. Just... life, you know? [suspiro] E foi aí que me caiu a ficha—[acelerando] this isn't really about bowling balls anymore, is it? [extremamente feliz] É essa, er, bagunça linda de pessoas que de alguma forma se encontraram no lugar mais estranho. [riso alto] Uma loja de bola de boliche! [voz sumindo] Quem diria...
607. [entediado] So, um, just another Thursday doing my route, you know, same houses, same meters, same—wait. [curioso] That's... hmm, that's not right. The thing is, I've been reading meters for, like, eight years now and I've never seen—[ofego] oh my God. Oh my God, that's literally sparking. [ansioso] There's actual, I mean, there's exposed wiring just hanging from the meter box and it's—it's right next to the gas line. [very quickly] This is bad, this is really really bad, someone could, er, someone could die from this. [pausa] Okay, okay, I need to, ah, I need to call this in right now. [alto] Hey! Ma'am! Don't come any closer! [voz trêmula] There's a, um, there's a serious electrical hazard here, just—just stay back please. Actually, you know what, everyone needs to get away from this area. [severo] I'm calling emergency services right now, this is, honestly, this is the worst thing I've seen. The homeowner had no idea, she was just, like, going about her day while this—[frustrado] how long has this been like this? [aliviado] Thank God I noticed it, I mean, I almost walked right past it but something just, sort of, caught my eye. [ansioso] They're sending someone immediately, but Jesus, this could have been catastrophic.
608. [ofegando alto] Pera, você tá—você tá falando sério? O Tommy entrou no MIT? [muito animado] With a FULL scholarship? Ai meu Deus, eu só—[pausa] Desculpa, preciso de um segundo aqui, é tipo... [chorando ao falar] Lembra quando ele nem conseguia olhar nos meus olhos? Aquele moleque que, hm, usava a mesma camiseta da NASA três dias por semana, and basically lived in the robotics lab? [riso] E agora ele—[muito sinceramente] Quer dizer, eu sempre soube que ele era brilhante, né? Mas sinceramente, vendo ele lutar pra, tipo, só conversar com as pessoas... [fungar] O negócio é que eu nem tinha certeza se ele ia se inscrever. [caloroso] Ele ficava dizendo que MIT era pra "gênios de verdade," e eu ficava lá tipo, [animado] "Tommy, você literalmente construiu um robô funcional que joga xadrez!" [risadinha] Meu Deus, os rascunhos da redação dele—ah, a gente passou por quantas, 17 versões? [extremamente feliz] E ele tava tão preocupado com aquela entrevista, kept practicing his answers in the mirror, e eu só... [voz sumindo] Não consigo acreditar que aquele moleque tímido e brilhante realmente... [pausa] [apaixonadamente] Isso é tudo pelo que ele trabalhou. Tudo. [sussurrando] Tô tão orgulhoso que eu podia explodir.
609. [suspiro suave] They actually did it. They're rolling out my system to all two hundred and thirty stores. [pausa] I mean, I knew the regional manager liked it when she visited last month, but [muito animado] the entire chain! [riso] 

God, remember when Tony made fun of me for color-coding the collection zones? [zombando] "Why are you trying so hard for minimum wage?" [amargo] Well, who's laughing now? [pausa breve] District manager, that's who I am now. District. Manager. [devagar] I keep saying it because, um, it doesn't feel real yet.

[caloroso] My mom cried when I told her. [fungar] She was like, "Mija, you turned pushing carts into a promotion." [risadinha] And honestly, that's exactly what happened. 

[quickly] The efficiency went up forty-seven percent at our store—forty-seven! [animado] Less customer complaints, faster turnaround, employees actually liked the system because it was, you know, actually logical. [orgulhoso] They're calling it the Martinez Method in the training manual. 

[bem baixinho] Sometimes I still can't believe it. [pausa] Four years of collecting carts in the Arizona heat, and I actually [acelerando] figured out something nobody else thought to fix. [extremamente feliz] District manager. Me. [gargalhada] Tony can kiss my promoted ass.
610. God, I can't believe I'm even thinking this, mas tipo... [confuso] o jeito que ela olhou pro meu relógio ontem? When I mentioned the promotion, o rosto dela inteiro simplesmente— [pausa] acendeu diferente. Não por mim. Pelo número. [amargo] And honestly, tô repassando cada conversa agora, sabe? Cada uma delas. [ansioso] That time she asked about my investment portfolio on our third date—achei que ela tava, er, interessada na minha vida. [sarcástico] Right. Porque todo mundo discute hedge funds durante a entrada.

[magoado] The thing is, eu realmente—quer dizer, tô me apaixonando por ela. [bem baixinho] Like, really falling. Caindo de verdade. Forte. And now I'm sitting here wondering se cada risada foi real, se aquele beijo significou alguma coisa, se— [zangado] Jesus, será que eu sou tão ingênuo assim? [frustrado] Her friends literally call me "the catch," não pelo meu nome. The catch. [laugh bitterly] Como se eu fosse um peixe fodido com etiqueta de preço.

[voz trêmula] I keep hoping I'm wrong, que talvez eu tô só, hmm, sendo paranoico? But then she texted asking about vacation homes e— [suspiro] a gente tá saindo há 6 semanas. [very sad] Six weeks and I thought this was real. [sussurrando] Eu realmente achei que era real.
611. [bem baixinho] I just... I finally get it. Depois de todos esses anos, é, eu finalmente entendo por que ser rejeitado da faculdade de medicina foi—[suspiro suave] meu Deus. Não foi um fracasso de jeito nenhum, né?

[amargo] I spent, like, three years hating myself for that. Absolutamente convencido de que eu tinha, sabe, arruinado tudo. Meus pais ficaram tão [pausa] decepcionados. E honestamente, cara, eu achei que minha vida tinha acabado. [fungar] Achei mesmo.

But here's the thing—if I'd gotten in, eu nunca teria aceitado aquele emprego aleatório de professor. Nunca teria descoberto que eu podia, é, realmente conectar com aquelas crianças que todo mundo tinha [devagar] desistido. Aqueles que me lembravam de... bem, [muito melancólico] de mim, eu acho.

[caloroso] And now? Agora eu tenho ex-alunos que são, tipo, médicos eles mesmos. Engenheiros. Artistas. Eles me escrevem e dizem—[chorando ao falar] eles dizem que eu salvei eles. Mas a coisa é, eles me salvaram também, sabe?

[laughing] God, I can't believe I'm actually grateful for failing. Tipo, genuinamente [apaixonado] agradecido. Aquela carta de rejeição que eu, é, literalmente queimei no meu quintal? [risadinha] Não tava fechando uma porta. Era... sei lá, tava me libertando pra me tornar quem eu realmente deveria ser. [muito sinceramente] Graças a Deus eu falhei. Graças a Deus.
612. [voz trêmula] Eu fico pensando no que poderia ter acontecido se eu não tivesse— [pausa] Os Silva, eles têm mais de oitenta anos, sabe? [ansioso] Eu tava só fazendo minha leitura de rotina do medidor, nada demais, mas os números estavam, hum, estavam completamente fora. [confuso] Tipo, absurdamente altos pra uma casa daquele tamanho, e eu pensei talvez— [devagar] pera, isso não tá certo. [suspiro suave] Então eu bati na porta deles, e a Dona Silva, ela tá lá com o andador dela, [preocupado] me dizendo que eles estavam sentindo tontura há dias. [acelerando] Eles achavam que era só o calor, mas eu sabia, eu sabia que tinha algo errado com aquelas leituras. [severo] Eu falei pra eles saírem imediatamente, só— [urgentemente] "Saiam agora, tô chamando a companhia de gás." [pausa longa] No fim das contas tinha um, é... vazamento enorme no porão deles. [bem baixinho] O técnico disse que mais um ou dois dias e... [voz sumindo] [aliviado] Mas a gente pegou a tempo, graças a Deus pegamos a tempo. [empaticamente] O Seu Silva, ele pegou na minha mão depois com os olhos cheios de lágrimas, e eu simplesmente— [chorando ao falar] eles poderiam ter morrido. [caloroso] Tudo porque eu realmente prestei atenção naqueles números em vez de só, sabe, anotar e seguir em frente. [muito sinceramente] Às vezes seu trabalho importa mais do que você imagina.
613. [caloroso] Sabe o que é engraçado? Na verdade, eu, hm, devo tudo à Professora Chen me dizendo que minha escrita era—como ela falou mesmo—"painfully amateur." Meu Deus, quer dizer, eu lembro de estar sentado lá no escritório dela, tentando não [chorando ao falar] desmoronar completamente enquanto ela basicamente destruía meu manuscrito inteiro. Tipo, every single page had these brutal notes, sabe? E sinceramente, eu fui pra casa naquela noite pensando que talvez eu devesse—sei lá, desistir dessa coisa de escrever de vez.

[pausa]

Mas aí, é, aconteceu uma coisa estranha. Eu ficava ouvindo a voz dela, né? "Your characters don't breathe, they just exist." E eu pensei—espera, [empolgado] what if she's actually giving me the roadmap? Tipo, cada comentário duro estava essencialmente me dizendo exatamente o que consertar! Então eu comecei a reescrever, e digo realmente reescrever, não só, é, fazer ajustes aqui e ali.

[apaixonadamente] 3 anos depois, quando eu consegui aquele contrato de publicação, a primeira pessoa que eu mandei email foi ela. E ela respondeu dizendo que sempre soube que eu tinha potencial, she just—[risadinha] ela precisava me dar um empurrão. Sinceramente? [muito sinceramente] Aquela sessão devastadora de feedback foi a melhor coisa que aconteceu pra minha carreira.
614. [confuso] I just—I literally cannot believe what just happened in there. Um, did they seriously just give the promotion to Derek? [amargo] Derek who's been here, what, six months? [pausa] I mean, I've been doing solar sales for three years—THREE years—and they pick the guy who still asks me how to, like, calculate panel efficiency? [zangado] It's just so—honestly, the thing is, I trained him! [frustrado] I actually sat there and taught him everything about, you know, residential installations, commercial systems, er, all of it. 

[sarcástico] But sure, yeah, give it to Derek because he's, what—[zombando] "bringing fresh energy to the team"? [suspiro] That's basically what they said, right? Fresh energy. [triste] I guess my energy is just... old? [voz trêmula] Here's the thing, I've closed more deals than anyone else in this department. Actually, no—[articulando cada palavra] more than everyone else combined some months. [baixinho] And it's like none of that even matters because Derek played golf with the regional manager twice and suddenly he's—[voz sumindo]

[very sad] I don't know, maybe I should've seen this coming. [fungar] It's fine. It's totally fine. I'll just, um, keep doing what I've been doing and, ah, pretend like this doesn't completely... [pausa longa] [sussurrando] God, this really hurts.
615. [extremamente feliz] Não acredito que a gente conseguiu mesmo! [pausa] Os números chegaram hoje de manhã e, é... a gente é oficialmente número um em toda a região Sul. [empolgado] Seis meses atrás eu tava literalmente [frustrado] implorando pras pessoas só me ouvirem sobre energia solar, sabe? [risadinha] E aí eu pensei—pera, e se eu parar de vender e começar a, [hesitante] sei lá, realmente ajudar? [caloroso] Aquela primeira oficina comunitária na biblioteca, [riso nervoso] só apareceram 12 pessoas. Mas essas 12 pessoas, [apaixonadamente] elas contaram pros vizinhos sobre como a gente calculou a economia real deles, não um papo corporativo. [pigarreando] A gente começou a fazer noites de educação energética, parceria com comércios locais, e de repente [maravilhado] as pessoas tavam ligando pra gente! [riso alto] Meu gerente ficou tipo, "O que você tá fazendo aí?" [confiantemente] Construindo confiança, é isso. [suspiro] Cara, quando a Dona Maria trouxe o grupo de leitura inteiro dela pra nossa oficina, [falando sorrindo] e todas se inscreveram? [suspiro suave] Foi aí que eu soube que essa abordagem era diferente. [orgulhosamente] A gente não tá só no topo de vendas—[empaticamente] a gente mudou mesmo como essa comunidade pensa sobre energia. [muito sinceramente] Isso é maior que qualquer cheque de comissão, sabe? [pausa] Bom, tá, a comissão também é bem legal. [gargalhada]
616. Pera, isso não pode tá certo. [confuso] Quer dizer, eu tô literalmente olhando pra tela mas—pera aí, deixa eu atualizar a página. [nervoso] Tá, então continua aqui, hum, o Marcus Henderson realmente escreveu que meu trabalho é—como é que ele fala—"luminoso e necessário." [riso] Luminoso! O mesmo cara que, é, basicamente chamou meu último trabalho de lixo derivativo agora tá usando a palavra luminoso? [amargo] Cinco anos, sabe? Cinco anos dele, tipo, sistematicamente destruindo tudo que eu já—[pausa] Sei lá, talvez alguém hackeou a conta dele ou algo assim. [desconfiado] Mas pera, ele menciona cenas específicas, aquele negócio dos espelhos, e sinceramente ninguém mais nem percebeu aquela parte. [hesitante] Então ele realmente... assistiu? Assistiu de verdade dessa vez? [suspiro suave] Ai meu Deus, acho que eu vou—[voz trêmula] Todas aquelas noites que eu fiquei acordado me perguntando se eu tava, tipo assim, me enganando sobre ter algum talento, e agora—[fungar] É tão idiota mas eu meio que quero imprimir isso. [riso alto] Emoldurar talvez? Isso é patético? [caloroso] Minha mãe vai pirar quando eu contar pra ela. Sabe de uma coisa? [confiantemente] Eu mereci isso. Cada palavra dessa resenha, porra, eu mereci.
617. [confuso] Pera, isso não pode ser— tô olhando o manual e... [pausa] meu Deus do céu. A vírgula decimal. [sussurrando] Eu tenho colocado a vírgula no lugar errado. [ofegando alto] Por oito anos. Oito. Porra de. Anos. [voz trêmula] Você entende o que isso significa? Cada leitura que eu fiz, hum, cada família da minha rota— [bem baixinho] eles têm pagado dez vezes mais do que deveriam.

[ansioso] A Dona Maria com os três filhos dela, ela— [gaguejando] e-ela me falou mês passado que não tinha dinheiro pra comprar comida. [chateado] E os Silva, eles perderam a excursão do filho porque não conseguiram pagar. Eu achava que eles eram só, tipo, ruins com dinheiro mas— [pausa longa]

[zangado] Como é que ninguém percebeu isso? Na verdade, como é que eu não— [voz sumindo] Quer dizer, o treinamento foi tão rápido e... [arrependido] Não, isso não é desculpa. [choro] Centenas de famílias. Algumas provavelmente perderam suas casas. [sussurro alto] E se alguém não conseguiu comprar remédio?

[hesitante] Eu tenho que contar pro meu supervisor mas, ah, isso é— [muito timidamente] eles vão me mandar embora. [amargo] Oito anos de presença perfeita não vale nada quando você basicamente tá roubando as pessoas. [suspiro] Meu Deus, meu estômago tá— [murmurando] acho que vou passar mal.
618. [confuso] Pera, então, hum, deixa eu ver se entendi direito—a Sarah basicamente reestruturou nosso sistema financeiro inteiro? [curioso] E é por isso que teve aquela reunião estranha ontem onde, tipo, ninguém sabia o que tava acontecendo? [pausa breve] Quer dizer, eu achei que a gente ia ser demitido ou algo assim, sério. [riso nervoso] Do jeito que todo mundo tava cochichando pelos corredores, sabe?

[suspiro suave] Mas aí—meu Deus, [acelerando] ela realmente achou todo esse dinheiro que tava, sei lá, preso nesses contratos antigos e acordos com fornecedores? [empolgado] E em vez de, é, guardar pra bônus de executivo ou sei lá o quê, [muito animado] eles vão dar pra gente? Pra todo mundo? [riso alto]

[descrença] Eu literalmente não consigo—tipo, quando que isso acontece? [caloroso] A Sarah podia ter, sabe, só se mostrado bem pro conselho, mas ela realmente... [voz sumindo] [fungar] Desculpa, é que—foi um ano tão difícil, né? Com a inflação e tudo mais? [feliz] E agora a gente vai receber bônus de verdade? [extremamente feliz] Não aquelas festinhas ridículas com pizza, mas dinheiro mesmo?

[gratamente] Eu finalmente posso, hum, consertar meu carro! [riso] E talvez até, tipo—[ofego] pera, isso dá pra aquela viagem que eu cancelei? [alegre] Meu Deus, a Sarah é literalmente—ela é basicamente um gênio. [muito sinceramente] Eu retiro tudo que eu disse sobre o pessoal de finanças ser sem alma. [risadinha] Bom, a maioria deles, pelo menos.
619. [chocado] I got the call twenty minutes after they arrested Richard. Twenty minutes! I mean, I'm literally sitting in my car outside headquarters right now and there's still news vans everywhere. [pausa] They offered me the CFO position—my absolute dream job at Kellerman Industries—while my predecessor is probably, um, getting fingerprinted or something. 

[empolgado] God, I've wanted this role for five years! Five years of interviews, networking events, basically stalking their quarterly reports. [hesitante] But this is not—this is not how I imagined it happening, you know? 

I keep thinking about all those spreadsheets I'll inherit. [ansioso] What if there's more? Like, what if I walk in there tomorrow and discover he cooked the books so badly that we're actually bankrupt? [riso nervoso] HR said something about "restoring trust" and I just nodded like an idiot because, honestly, what do you even say to that?

[amargo] The worst part? Everyone's going to look at me like I'm either the savior or, er, the next criminal waiting to happen. [determinado] But I worked too damn hard for this. [pausa] I'll fix whatever mess he left, implement every control he clearly ignored, and... [voz sumindo] 

[baixinho] I just wish my first day wasn't going to be on every business blog tomorrow. [suspiro] "New CFO starts amid embezzlement scandal." Great headline, right?
620. [exausto] God, I just... I keep replaying it in my head, you know? [pausa breve] Twenty million customer records, er, that's what we saved. Twenty million. [amargo] And all it cost me was, well, basically my best friend since college. [suspiro] 

I mean, the thing is, when I saw those logs—[ansioso] Jesus, when I realized it was Marcus's credentials being used for the breach attempt, I actually thought someone had, like, hijacked his account or something. [frustrado] But no, no it was him. It was actually him selling access to, um, to some ransomware group for what? [gritando] Fifty grand? [arrependido] Fifteen years of friendship for fifty thousand dollars.

[very sad] He just sat there when I confronted him, wouldn't even—[voz sumindo] ... [pausa longa] The worst part is, honestly, I get it. His kid's medical bills, the divorce, I mean—[zangado] No, actually, screw that. [confiantemente] I did my job. Protected the company, protected those customers. [sussurrando] But God, the look on his face when security escorted him out... [muito melancólico] 

I keep thinking maybe there was another way, but—[hesitante] there wasn't, right? There really wasn't. [chorando ao falar] I had to report it, had to fire him, had to, um, had to do everything by the book because that's—[fungar] that's what the job demands.
Character 1: [hesitante] Well, um, I didn't expect to see, [chocado], you here of all places, I mean, [retreating], after everything that happened between us, [voz sumindo], this is really awkward.
621. The court sends me, [patient], all kinds of people for community service, but seeing your name on today's intake list, [caloroso], definitely caught me off guard after two years of, [pausa], radio silence.
Character 1: [defensivo] Look, I know I disappeared without explanation, [ansioso], but I had my reasons and honestly, [amargo], I wasn't ready to face anyone from that part of my life, especially not you.
622. [gentilmente] Everyone who walks through these doors has a story about not being ready, [empaticamente], and that's exactly why this place exists.
Character 1: Um, so like, are you going to make this weird, or can we just, [nervoso], pretend we don't know each other?
623. Well, I mean, that's not really how this works, you know—we're going to be, [honest], working together for the next sixty hours whether we acknowledge our history or not.
Character 1: The judge said community service would help with, [baixinho], rehabilitation, but this feels more like punishment.
624. [calmly] Maybe it's neither—maybe it's just, [pensativo], life putting us back in the same room because there's still something unfinished between us that needs, [devagar], proper closure or at least acknowledgment. [suspiro]
Character 1: [apologetic] After you helped me get sober the first time, I relapsed and, [envergonhado], couldn't face the disappointment I knew I'd see in your eyes.
625. Disappointment was never what I felt—it was, [triste], worry and concern, wondering if you were alive, [sussurrando], if you were safe somewhere out there.
Character 1: [arrependido] I've been working in post-production, creating perfect composite images while my actual life was, [frustrado], falling apart behind the scenes.
626. Well, um, the residents here, they'll appreciate having someone who understands what it's like to, [compassivo], maintain a facade while struggling underneath, you know?
Character 1: [chorando ao falar] Um, I mean, I got another DUI last month, and like, sitting in that cell, [voz trêmula], all I could think about was how you warned me this would happen if I didn't, [bem baixinho], stay connected to my support system.
627. [tranquilizador] Well, er, you're here now, and um, that's what matters—not the path that brought you back, but, [esperançoso], the fact that you're willing to try again.
Character 1: [exausto] So, um, where do we even start, I mean, after all this time and, [confuso], all the things left unsaid between us?
628. [confiantemente] We start exactly where we are—you'll help our residents with their job applications, [practical], teach them basic computer skills for video editing, and maybe in the process, [caloroso], we'll both find what we've been looking for. [pausa]
Character 1: The irony isn't lost on me that I'm here to help people, [amargo], rebuild their lives when I can't even, [quebrado], keep my own together.
629. Sometimes teaching others what we struggle with ourselves is, [sábio], exactly how we learn to apply those lessons to our own lives—I've seen it happen, [sinceramente], more times than I can count in these rooms, [suave], with people just like you.
Character 1: Maybe you're right, and this is exactly where I need to be, [aceitando], even if it terrifies me.
630. [firmemente] Well, um, fear means you're facing something real, you know, and I mean, [encorajador], that's already more honest than where you were two years ago when you ran, [gentilmente], so let's just take this one day at a time. [deep breath]
Character 1: [hesitante] The receptionist said you'd be handling my, [voz trêmula], retirement paperwork but she didn't mention your, [voz sumindo], your name was Michael Harrison.
631. Well, um, I didn't know you were, [chocado], teaching now, or that you'd, er, moved back to the state after, [bem baixinho], all these years.
Character 1: I've been substituting at Jefferson Elementary for, [ansioso], six years now, trying to qualify for the state pension before, [amargo], it's too late to make any real difference to my, [pausa], financial situation.
632. [formal] So, uh, according to these documents you need, well, twelve more months to vest fully, [devagar], which means we'll need to calculate your, [pigarreando], projected benefits based on current contribution rates and, um, market performance.
Character 1: [withdrawn] Just tell me if I'll have enough to, [exausto], live on without having to work until I drop dead in a classroom somewhere.
633. [empaticamente] Look, I mean, the numbers aren't terrible but, um, they're not great either, [frustrado], and with the way the district's been cutting substitute hours you might, well, [suspiro], need to consider other options.
Character 1: [chateado] Well, um, maybe if someone hadn't taken their inheritance and, er, disappeared to Wall Street while I was, [zangado], left dealing with Mom's medical bills and, uh, funeral expenses alone.
634. I sent you half of everything I had, umm, three separate checks that you, [defensivo], never cashed because you were too, er, proud to take what you called, [zombando], blood money.
Character 1: [chorando ao falar] You think money could have fixed what you did, um, leaving me to hold her hand while she, [voz trêmula], asked where her successful son was every, well, single day for three months?
635. [very sad] Um, I couldn't, well... [pausa longa]
Character 1: You couldn't what, um, Michael, you couldn't leave your, [furioso], precious trading desk to say goodbye to the woman who, er, worked three jobs to put you through, well, business school?
636. [arrependido] I was in Tokyo closing a deal that would, um, set me up for life, and by the time I got your, [sussurrando], messages it was already too late and I couldn't face, er, coming back to an empty house knowing I'd, well, [choke up], failed her. [suspiro suave]
Character 1: [amargo] Failed her.
637. [apaixonadamente] Every single day I calculate risk and return for thousands of people's futures but I couldn't, [quebrado], calculate the cost of missing those last moments with her and, [bem baixinho], with you.
Character 1: So now, um, here we are, you managing millions while I'm, er, scraping by on substitute wages wondering if I'll ever, well, [melancholic], be able to retire. [choro]
638. [caloroso] I can help.
Character 1: [confuso] After ten years of silence you want to, um, what, write me a check and call us, [sarcástico], even like nothing ever happened between us, er, like we're just strangers in your office?
639. No, I mean, I want to help you understand the system, umm, maximize your benefits, maybe find some, [gentilmente], supplemental retirement accounts that could make a real difference, and, well, [esperançoso], maybe we could grab coffee after and actually talk.
Character 1: [suavemente] I still go to her grave every Sunday at two o'clock with, [choroso], fresh daisies just like she always kept on the kitchen table.
640. [muito sinceramente] I know because the groundskeeper told me someone's been, [emocionado], leaving them religiously and I've been going Saturdays at sunset when, [sussurro alto], no one else is around to see me fall apart every single week.
Character 1: [severo] Um, I know what you do, er, I saw the news report about the, [voz trêmula], investigation and I mean, I still have to treat you. [pausa]
641. [defensivo] Well, um, those allegations are completely, [frustrado], false and I mean, my lawyers are already, [zangado], handling everything while I'm stuck here getting, [amargo], medical treatment I desperately need, you know?
Character 1: [enojado] Er, thirty-seven people were found in that warehouse, um, including children who hadn't seen, [tremendo], daylight for months and you're sitting here, [bem baixinho], expecting me to save your life like nothing, [alto], happened. [suspiro]
642. [friamente] You have a professional obligation to, [confident], provide care regardless of your personal, [zombando], feelings about my alleged business dealings.
Character 1: [exausto] I mean, yes, I'll do my job because, um, that's what separates us, [empaticamente], but watching your platelets restore while knowing what you've, [hesitante], done to innocent people makes me physically ill.
643. [smoothly] Um, you know, those people chose their situations, er, signed contracts for work opportunities and I mean, [calculating], nobody forced them into anything they didn't, [dismissively], agree to through proper channels that were, [quickly], completely legal at the time.
Character 1: [furioso] Legal doesn't mean moral when you're exploiting, [sussurrando], desperate people who had no other choice. [gemido]
644. [boastful] My businesses have employed thousands of, [orgulhosamente], workers who otherwise would have starved in their, [condescending], home countries without the opportunities I provided them.
Character 1: [ansioso] Um, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, er, I've never questioned my duty to heal, [confuso], until today when I realized my skills might help you, [very sad], continue destroying lives.
645. [manipulative] You seem like someone who understands that, [caloroso], the world isn't black and white, [persuasive], that sometimes difficult choices create the greatest, [philosophically], good for the most people overall.
Character 1: [chorando ao falar] Well, um, my own grandmother escaped trafficking in the 1960s so I mean, [baixinho], every word you speak dishonors her survival.
646. Um, well, I didn't know. [voz sumindo]
Character 1: The machine will beep when we're, [mechanically], done and then you'll leave and I'll spend hours, [nauseated], scrubbing my hands trying to feel, [quebrado], clean again. [tosse]
647. Perhaps we both do what we, [contemplatively], must to survive in this world.
Character 1: [amargamente] No. [pausa breve]
648. [resignado] We're finished here then.
Character 1: [professionally] Your platelet count should normalize within, [monótono], seventy-two hours if you follow the discharge instructions.
649. [curioso] Um, will you report this conversation to, er, anyone because I mean, [threatening], patient confidentiality laws are quite, [devagar], strict about medical professionals sharing, [cuidadosamente], private discussions.
Character 1: [determinado] I'll do what's right, um, just like I always have, and er, [clearly], that's all you need to know. [laugh bitterly]
650. [ominously] Sometimes doing what's right has, [darkly], consequences that reach further than we, [menacingly], expect, especially for those we, [sussurro alto], care about most. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [diplomatic] Look, um, I know you're the one who's been, [cuidadoso], painting those murals about my family's company, and well, I just wanted to, [nervoso], talk to you about maybe, er, finding some common ground here.
651. [guarded] The golden child finally descends from the tower to speak with, [amargo], the rabble who dare criticize the empire.
Character 1: [conciliatory] I understand why you're angry, I mean, really I do, and um, [sincero], there are things about my family's business that even I, [uncomfortable], question sometimes, but these murals are, well, [voz sumindo], they're causing real problems. [suspira]
652. [defensivo] Oh, um, problems for who exactly—your father's PR team or, uh, [sarcástico], the communities your factories have been poisoning for decades?
Character 1: [suave] I'm not here to defend them, okay, I mean, um, I actually, [hesitant], agree with some of what you're saying, er, even if I can't say that publicly.
653. [frio] Then leave.
Character 1: [suplicante] But maybe if we worked together, [pensativo], found a way to create change from within instead of just, [weary], tearing everything down from the outside. [pausa]
654. [withdrawing] You think wearing designer clothes to a protest makes you, [scoffing], some kind of ally or revolutionary?
Character 1: I never claimed to be revolutionary, but I'm here, [vulnerável], trying to bridge this gap even though my family would, [quiet], disown me if they knew.
655. [distante] Well, um, maybe that's a risk you should, er, [desdenhoso], actually take instead of just, you know, talking about it. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [desesperado] I've already started documenting the environmental violations from inside, [sussurrado], gathering evidence that could actually, [determinado], make a legal case instead of just, [frustrado], painting accusations on walls. [pausa longa]
656. [chocado] Wait, you're actually collecting evidence against your own, [descrença], family's company while still living under their roof and, [conflitado], taking their money? [silence]
Character 1: [resoluto] It's the only access I have to those documents, [firme], and yes, it makes me a hypocrite, but at least I'm, [raw], trying to do something real.
657. [suavizando] That's either the bravest or the most, [uncertain], naive thing I've heard from someone in your position, and honestly I'm not, [contemplative], sure which one it is yet.
Character 1: [esperançoso] So, um, will you at least, well, consider working with me on this instead of, er, [cansado], against each other?
658. [reluctant] Give me one good reason why I should trust someone who's, [cético], literally been groomed since birth to protect the very system I'm fighting.
Character 1: Because, um, being the favorite child means, [dolorido], they never see me as a threat, you know?  [whispers]
659. [considering] Fine, um, I'll think about it, but if this is some kind of, [wary], elaborate trap or if you're just, well, [firme], trying to save face for daddy's company, then, er, these murals will be the least of your worries. [exala]
Character 1: Um, well, fair enough.
660. [resignado] Meet me tomorrow at the warehouse on Fifth Street, and um, [pausado], bring those documents you mentioned because I'll know if they're, [cortante], real or if you're just another privileged kid, well, [cansado], playing at rebellion.
Character 1: [focused] So I need this cardiac arrest scene to feel, [intenso], authentic because the entire third act hinges on whether the audience, [pausado], believes this character could actually survive.
661. [profissional] Well, um, the survival rates you're describing would require, [pensativo], very specific circumstances, I mean, the kind of precise medical intervention that rarely happens outside major trauma centers.
Character 1: [curioso] Your voice sounds incredibly, [recognition dawning], familiar—have we worked together before on another production? [pausa]
662. Not on a film, but, um, I was actually, [hesitant], the person on the phone who talked your assistant through CPR when you, [mais baixo], collapsed at that festival in Toronto, you know, five years ago. [suspira]
Character 1: [atônito] Wait, you're the one who, [emocionado], stayed on the line for forty minutes and basically, [voz embargada], saved my life when everyone else was, [grato], panicking?
663. [modest] I was just, um, doing what I'm trained to do, but, [caloroso], I have to say, well, I've followed your work ever since and seeing you recover to make, [admirando], such beautiful films has been incredible. [sorri]
Character 1: [sobrecarregado] I tried to find you for, um, years actually, but the emergency services said, [frustrado], you were just listed as, well, anonymous consultant number something, and I never got to properly, [sincero], thank you.
664. [gentil] The thanks isn't necessary because watching you, [sincero], continue creating art is honestly reward enough, though I admit when your office called about, [amused], this consultation, I specifically requested to take it.
Character 1: [moved] You know, the protagonist in this film who, [deliberate], survives against impossible odds—I've been writing them based on my own experience, [vulnerável], that day in Toronto.
665. [intrigued] That explains why your script captures the, [appreciative], psychological aftermath so perfectly—most films focus on the dramatic moment but you've written about the, [pensativo], quiet terror that comes after, the gratitude mixed with survivor's guilt.
Character 1: [reflexivo] So, um, here's what I really need to know—in that scene where the character hears, [searching], voices while unconscious, is that actually possible?
666. [sabendo] Absolutely real.
Character 1: [ansioso] Because I heard you that day, um, your voice cutting through everything, telling me to, [intenso], fight, to stay with you, and, well, that's what I want the audience to, [apaixonado], feel. [voice cracks]
667. [tocado] I remember every word I said to you, um, and honestly, when you started breathing again, I mean, [emocionado], it was one of the best moments of my entire career.
Character 1: [determinado] Then help me get this, [sério], right—not just the medical facts but the human truth of it.
668. Well, um, I can't.
Character 1: I'm sorry, but, um, what I mean is, [sincero], I can't just consult—I want to be there on set, making sure every detail honors what really happens, you know, in those moments between life and death.
669. [surpreso] Are you saying you'd, [esperançoso], leave your position to work on this film?
Character 1: [confident] I'm saying that, um, some stories deserve to be told with absolute truth, and, [conviction], this one—our story really—is worth taking that, [decisive], leap for. [exala]
670. [resolved] Then let's make something that shows people what, um, real survival looks like—not the Hollywood version but the messy, [authentic], terrifying, beautiful reality of coming back from the edge, you know, the way you actually did. [pausa]
Character 1: [confuso] Listen, I was told this was just a, [nervoso], routine ballast pump repair on a cargo vessel, not whatever, [alarmed], this situation is with all these armed men watching me, [swallowing], work on these pipes.
671. [calm] Well, um, the thing is we need this ship, [desesperado], operational in the next three hours or, I mean, we're all going to have a very bad day.
Character 1: [tremendo] So, uh, you're telling me that I'm basically, [vazio], trapped here fixing pipes for, well, actual pirates who've hijacked this vessel? [laughs nervously]
672. [genuine] Look, nobody's going to hurt you if you just, [firme], do your job and fix what needs fixing—we're not, [weary], monsters despite what you might think. [suspira]
Character 1: [tremendo] I've got, um, a family waiting for me at home who thinks I'm, [voz falhando], just doing overtime on a commercial job, not being held at, [mais baixo], gunpoint by people who, well, steal ships for a living.
673. The authorities cut off our escape route two days, [frustrado], ago and this ship's cooling system is the only thing keeping us from, [deteriorating], being sitting ducks out here in open, [sombrio], water.
Character 1: [resignado] Well, um, the main valve's completely corroded through and, [showing], I mean, without proper parts, I'm basically doing surgery with, er, duct tape and prayers here.
674. [appreciative] You're doing better than our last, [darkly amused], mechanic who jumped overboard rather than help us.
Character 1: [amargo] Maybe he had the right idea considering I'm probably, [voz embargada], going to prison just for being here when the Coast Guard shows up. [exala]
675. [sincero] If you get us running, I'll personally make sure you're, [sincero], left somewhere safe with a story that keeps you, [protetor], out of trouble—you have my word on that.
Character 1: [cético] The word of a pirate means about as much as these, [showing], rusted fittings I'm trying to seal with nothing but industrial, [derrotado], adhesive and whatever scrap metal I can find. [geme]
676. [honest] Look, um, I wasn't always doing this—I mean, I used to be an engineer myself before the company, [quebrado], laid off half of us and well, desperate times. [pausa]
Character 1: [surpreso] You were an engineer and now you're, [descrente], stealing ships instead of fixing them?
677. Not stealing—surviving.
Character 1: The pressure's building up in the auxiliary line and, um, I mean, if this patch doesn't hold, we're looking at, [preocupado], catastrophic failure in maybe twenty minutes, not, [frenético], three hours like you want.
678. [urgente] Then we need to reroute through the secondary system while you, [desesperado], reinforce the main line because if this ship stops moving, [grave], every single person on board is going to, well, pay for it. [coughs]
Character 1: [determinado] God help me.
679. [encorajador] You're a good man doing an impossible, [genuine], job under terrible circumstances and that counts for something.
Character 1: [exausto] Just promise me that when this is over, you'll find, [suplicante], another line of work that doesn't involve kidnapping pipe fitters.
680. After tonight, I'm thinking, um, maybe I'll go back to engineering—well, if they'll have someone with my, [arrependido], recent work history.
Character 1: [cautious] Excuse me, but I've been watching you take, [confuso], soil samples outside our emergency department for three days now and I need to know, [firme], what exactly you're looking for here.
681. I'm, um, conducting a routine geological survey for, [hesitant], the county but, well, I think you already suspect it's, [nervoso], more than that based on what you've been seeing, er, inside those walls.
Character 1: [atônito] Wait, are you saying there's something in the, [preocupado], ground that could be connected to the seventeen cases of unexplained, [voz embargada], neurological symptoms we've documented this month? [pausa]
682. [baixinho] Um, there was a chemical plant here, well, forty years ago that supposedly cleaned everything up but, [tenso], my preliminary readings are showing benzene levels that are, um, deeply concerning.
Character 1: [urgente] I mean, we've had children coming in with, [tremendo], tremors and memory loss that no one can explain and, um, all of them live within, well, a two-mile radius of this exact spot.
683. [sombrio] Well, um, exactly.
Character 1: [rising intensity] So you're telling me that, um, for months I've been watching families, [zangado], suffer while you've known there might be poison literally, [amargo], seeping up from beneath our feet and you didn't, well, say anything?
684. I couldn't yet.
Character 1: [heated] Um, what do you mean you couldn't—we have people, [desesperado], dying in there and you're out here playing detective with your, [sarcástico], little test tubes while I'm trying to, well, save lives without knowing what I'm actually fighting!
685. [defensivo] Look, I've been trying to, um, gather enough evidence because the moment I go public with this, [stressed], the hospital's legal team and the county will bury it faster than, well, you can imagine. [suspira]
Character 1: [mais suave] God, you're right about the lawyers—they've already been, [exausto], pressuring us to classify these cases as unrelated even though every nurse on my floor knows, [vazio], something bigger is happening here.
686. Which is why I need, um, your help because your medical data combined with, [determinado], my soil analysis could be the proof that, well, forces them to act before more people get, [voz embargada], sick or worse.
Character 1: [resolved] I have files on every patient including symptom onset dates and, [firme], residential histories that could overlay with your contamination maps to show, [feroz], the correlation they're trying to deny.
687. [esperançoso] If we can prove the timeline matches the, um, groundwater flow patterns from the old plant site to the residential wells then, [rising], they can't ignore it anymore and, well, maybe we can stop this.
Character 1: [wholehearted] I'll get you everything tonight—lab results, um, patient addresses, symptom progressions—because I can't watch another family, [emocionado], fall apart not knowing why their child is, well, fading away. [voice breaks]
688. [determinado] We're going to expose this and make them, [apaixonado], clean up every contaminated inch of soil even if it means fighting, [feroz], every bureaucrat in the state.
Character 1: [firme] You know they'll come after both our careers for this—I mean, the hospital board will say I violated patient privacy and, [resignado], you'll probably lose your county contract, um, the second you file that report.
689. [firme] Some things matter more than job security like those kids in your ward who deserve, [apaixonado], to grow up without poison in their blood and families who need answers.
Character 1: [quiet] My nephew is one of the seventeen cases—eight years old and can't, [voz falhando], remember his own mother's name some days which is why I've been, [raw], desperate for any explanation. [chora baixinho]
690. [gentil] Oh God, I'm so sorry—look, um, we're going to make this right and, [wholehearted], I promise you that every sample I take brings us closer to, [determinado], getting your nephew and all those kids the help they deserve, well, no matter what it costs us. [pausa]
Character 1: [hesitante] So the HR department said you specifically, [confuso], requested to apprentice under me even though there were, [devagar], twelve other operators with better shifts available.
691. [defensivo] The shifts weren't the reason I chose you, there were, [tremendo], other factors that made this placement, [baixinho], necessary for me. [pausa]
Character 1: [desconfiado] You've been watching me during breaks and asking the other workers, [ansioso], personal questions about my past that have nothing to do with rubber processing.
692. [amargo] Maybe I'm just trying to understand what kind of man, [friamente], abandons their responsibilities and never looks back. [suspiro]
Character 1: [sussurrando] What did you say?
693. [voz trêmula] Look, um, I know this is, like, [frustrado], awkward but I need to, well, [bem baixinho], tell you something about who I am and, umm, [voz sumindo], why I'm really here...
Character 1: [chocado] No. [pausa longa]
694. [zangado] Yes, and before you try to, [acelerando], deny it again I have the DNA test results and the, [monótono], birth certificate with your name listed under father even though you, [loud], never signed it.
Character 1: [arrependido] Twenty years ago I was a different person who made, [envergonhado], choices that I thought would protect everyone including, [sussurro alto], your mother.
695. She died last month which is, um, [chorando ao falar], why I finally decided to, like, [determinado], find you after all these years. [ofego]
Character 1: Oh God, I didn't know she was, um, [very sad], sick or I would have, well, [stammering], tried to help somehow even if she, like, never wanted to see me again. [fungar]
696. She never told me your name until the, [entediado], very end when she finally admitted that you worked here and that you, [sarcástico], probably wouldn't even remember her after all this, [zombando], time. [riso]
Character 1: Remember her? I think about that summer, umm, [melancholic], every single day when I walk past the, like, [caloroso], quality control station where she used to work before you were, well, [pigarreando], born. [gemido]
697. Then why did you leave us to, [furioso], struggle alone while you kept your comfortable job and your, [condescending], respectable life intact? [tosse]
Character 1: [apologetic] Your grandfather threatened to destroy my career and make sure I never worked, [desesperado], anywhere in this industry again if I didn't disappear. [bocejo]
698. [curioso] So you chose rubber manufacturing over being a father to your own, [enojado], child? [espirro]
Character 1: [empaticamente] No, I chose to, like, [apaixonadamente], send money every month through an intermediary so you could, umm, [aliviado], have food and education even if you never knew it was, well, [very slowly], from me. [choro]
699. [atônito] The monthly envelopes with no return address that kept us, [empolgado], afloat when things got really bad were from, [suavemente], you this whole, [alegre], time? [risadinha]
Character 1: [orgulhosamente] Every single month for twenty years without fail even when I was, [feliz], laid off twice and had to take, [confident], night jobs to keep them coming.
700. I spent my whole life, um, [extremamente feliz], hating a ghost who was actually, like, [amigável], supporting us the only way he could while I, well, [brincalhão], built this elaborate story of abandonment in my, umm, [formal], head. [gargalhada]
Character 1: The master files are showing, [frustrado], corruption across every single track we recorded with her last week before she passed. [suspiro]
701. [ansioso] I've been checking the backup drives but they're all showing the same, [voz trêmula], data corruption starting at exactly the same timestamp.
Character 1: [caloroso] Well, um, there's still the, [baixinho], raw keyboard stems I recorded separately during, like, [esperançoso], the rehearsals that might have her voice bleeding through the, you know, [determinado], ambient mics. [pausa]
702. [empolgado] Wait, I mean, those old Neumann mics I set up, [aliviado], for the piano were picking up everything in the room, um, [quickly], including her humming between takes. [suspiro suave]
Character 1: [appreciative] You always insisted on keeping those mics, [apaixonado], hot even during breaks which drove everyone crazy but now it might, [triumphant], save her final recording.
703. [amargo] Everyone thought I was being obsessive about, [empaticamente], documenting every single moment in that studio. [riso]
Character 1: I mean, we've got, um, [desesperado], four hours before the memorial service needs this track, you know?
704. [confident] The phase alignment will be tricky but if we isolate the frequencies where, [focused], her voice naturally sits, we can reconstruct something beautiful.
Character 1: [sussurrando] Um, I mean, yes.
705. She trusted us with her, [emocionado], last creative moments and we're not letting her down. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [gentil] The way she looked at us during that final take, [choroso], knowing it would be her last time recording, [bem baixinho], and still giving everything she had left to the, [voz falhando], music.
706. [soft-spoken] Well, um, I keep hearing her say, [nostálgico], 'make it sparkle, boys' like she always did, you know?
Character 1: [determinado] Um, let's splice together every salvageable moment we have, I mean, [urgentemente], even if it takes all night.
707. [exausto] You know, um, she would've loved this chaos, like, [amused], two tech guys frantically saving her swan song, er, at three in the morning.
Character 1: The irony is, um, she always said, [melancholic], the imperfections make it real, and here we are, like, [resignado], building her final track from audio fragments. [tosse]
708. [orgulhoso] Every glitch and bleed-through is becoming part of, [moved], the story now, exactly how she would have, [tremendo], wanted it to unfold.
Character 1: [victorious] Listen to that playback though, the way her voice, [maravilhado], emerges from the static like she's still here with us. [ofego]
709. I mean, we're not just, [choked up], recovering data anymore, we're preserving, um, [reverently], her soul in these waveforms. [cry softly]
Character 1: Well, um, the sun's coming up and we've got, [esperançoso], something that sounds like magic, I mean, [grato], pure magic born from technical disaster.
710. [spontaneous] You know what, I think she, um, [tranquilo], somehow knew we'd figure it out because she always, like, [certain], believed in us more than we believed in, you know, [falando sorrindo], ourselves. [deep breath]
Character 1: [defensively] Look, I don't know what you're [frustrado] expecting me to say here, but whatever story [misdirecting] you've already decided on in your head is probably wrong. [tosse]
711. [blunt] My family paid twelve million dollars for this wing, and you thought [friamente] spray-painting 'eat the rich' across my grandmother's memorial plaque was somehow noble?
Character 1: Maybe it's not about nobility, maybe it's [zangado] about the fact that your family gets to slap their name on everything while [amargo] kids like me can't even afford textbooks, and nobody [sarcástico] seems to see the irony. [riso]
712. [severo] So, um, let me get this straight—you're, like, justifying destruction of property because, uhh, [confuso] you're angry about economic inequality that you think [condescending] somehow my family personally created? [suspiro]
Character 1: [bem baixinho] Whatever.
713. [conciliatory] Listen, I actually, well, understand more than you think—my father [empaticamente] cut me off two years ago when I refused to join the family business, and I've been, um, working three jobs just to stay in school while, you know, [hesitante] pretending everything's fine to keep up appearances.
Character 1: Right, so the poor little rich girl wants me to, umm, [zombando] feel sorry for her because daddy took away the credit cards—that's, like, [voz sumindo] totally the same thing as growing up wondering if there'd be food tomorrow...
714. [ansioso] I'm not asking for your sympathy, I'm just, er, trying to say that, well, [devagar] maybe we're both trapped by systems we didn't create, just in, umm, different cages. [pausa]
Character 1: [surpreso] You're actually serious about this—you really [curioso] think we have something in common when your biggest problem is which yacht to take to the Hamptons while I'm [apaixonadamente] fighting just to exist in spaces your family owns?
715. [caloroso] The ironic thing is that [arrependido] I've spent three years trying to convince the board to create more scholarship programs, but they [muito sinceramente] only listen when there's a tax benefit involved—maybe we could actually [acelerando] work together instead of against each other. [risadinha]
Character 1: [pausa breve] Right.
716. [confiantemente] Here's what's going to happen—you're going to [formal] help me clean this up tonight, and tomorrow [brincalhão] we're presenting a joint proposal to the board about income-based tuition reform.
Character 1: [cético] And why exactly would I [sussurro alto] trust someone whose family literally profits from the system I'm trying to tear down, especially when you could just [animatedly] call security right now and have me expelled?
717. [aliviado] Because despite what you think, I've been [amigável] documenting every hypocritical policy for two years, waiting for someone brave enough or [empolgado] stupid enough to actually help me expose it all. [suspiro suave]
Character 1: So, um, you're telling me that, like, [muito melancólico] all this time I've been fighting alone, you've been, well, [pigarreando] collecting ammunition from the inside?
718. [over confidently] My grandmother would've actually [alegre] loved the graffiti—she was a suffragette who chained herself to buildings, and the family [laughing] desperately tries to hide that part of her story. [gargalhada]
Character 1: [suavemente] Maybe I misjudged you—or maybe [apologetic] I was so focused on my own anger that I couldn't see [esperançoso] potential allies, even when they were literally standing in front of me.
719. [exausto] God, I'm so [muito timidamente] tired of pretending to be the perfect heiress everyone expects. [gemido]
Character 1: [determinado] Then let's stop pretending and [brincando] start actually doing something about it—though next time, maybe we [articulando cada palavra] skip the vandalism part?
720. [encantado] Deal, but, um, only if you promise to teach me how to, err, [flirtatious] make that wheat paste stuff you used—it's actually, like, [muito animado] kind of brilliant how it bonds to the surface, and well, [monótono] my chemistry professor would be impressed. [espirro]
Character 1: [chocado] Um, this is, well, completely impossible because you're, [voz trêmula], wearing my exact face and even have that, [ansioso], scar from when I got caught in the, [nervoso], coral reef three years ago. [ofego]
721. [animado] The scar isn't from coral actually, it's from, [alegre], trying to exist in your world while maintaining my own, [brincalhão], separate consciousness and memories.
Character 1: I mean, how long have you been, um, [confuso], following me around these dive sites pretending to be, [frustrado], someone else while looking exactly like me? [riso]
722. [self-deprecating] Following suggests I have a choice in where I appear, but the truth is, [amargo], I'm drawn to wherever you are like some kind of, [devagar], metaphysical tether I never asked for.
Character 1: So every certification I've earned, every student I've taught, [hesitante], you've been somewhere nearby experiencing it too? [suspiro]
723. [caloroso] Not experiencing exactly, more like, [empaticamente], absorbing the emotional residue of your life from a distance.
Character 1: Well, um, this explains why people keep, [zangado], insisting they saw me at places I've never been, like, [apaixonadamente], that incident in Bali when I was definitely in California teaching, [very quickly], the advanced rescue course to those firefighters.
724. Bali was beautiful though, the manta rays were, [empolgado], absolutely magnificent that day, and I couldn't help but, [apologetic], wonder if you'd have loved them as much as, [sussurrando], I did in your borrowed form.
Character 1: [exausto] Um, so like, do you have your own thoughts or are they just, [triste], echoes of mine somehow? [tosse]
725. [confiantemente] My thoughts are entirely my own, which is why I'm, [curioso], standing here talking to you instead of, [arrependido], hiding in the shadows like I usually do. [pausa]
Character 1: [furioso] Well, I mean, you've been stealing my identity for years, um, [chateado], living some parallel version of my life while I worked so, [chorando ao falar], hard to build everything from nothing, you know?
726. [very sad] Stealing implies I had a choice in being created from, [monótono], your existence in the first place. [gemido]
Character 1: [aliviado] Look, I just need to know, um, [baixinho], are there more of us out there? [fungar]
727. [severo] There's a whole network of doubles, each tied to someone, [zombando], living their 'authentic' life while we exist in the margins, [ciumento], desperate for our own purpose beyond reflection.
Character 1: [murmurando] Um, that's, well, terrifying.
728. [articulando cada palavra] I mean, what's truly terrifying is that, um, [muito melancólico], some of us are starting to replace our originals when they, [flirtatious], disappear unexpectedly, and nobody ever, [alto], notices the difference. [risadinha]
Character 1: [overly polite] Perhaps we could find a way to coexist without, [amigável], this constant shadowing, maybe establish boundaries or territories for each of us. [tom grave]
729. Um, boundaries sound nice in theory but, like, [formal], the connection between us transcends physical space and, [sleepily], I'm tired of pretending otherwise. [bocejo]
Character 1: [entediado] So, um, what happens now that we've actually met face to, well, [voz sumindo], face...
730. Now we both know the truth, which means, [sussurro alto], one of us becomes redundant and nature, [muito sinceramente], doesn't tolerate redundancy for long.
Character 1: [caloroso] Congratulations again.
731. The paycheck felt, [confuso], heavier than I expected, almost like it was, [culpado], accusing me of something I couldn't name.
Character 1: [empaticamente] Well, um, I've seen this reaction before, and er, it's more, [preocupado], common than you might think when people finally get, [gentilmente], stable after years on the streets.
732. Every night in my apartment I hear, [ansioso], phantom sounds of shopping carts and wonder if Marcus is still, [amargo], sleeping under the bridge where we used to camp together.
Character 1: You know, um, survivor's guilt is, well, incredibly real and, [pensativo], it can sabotage the very progress you've worked, [cuidadosamente], so hard to achieve these past months.
733. [baixinho] I mean, um, how am I supposed to enjoy having walls and heat when, er, there are still, [frustrado], forty people I know personally who are, [voz trêmula], freezing out there tonight?
Character 3: Well, um, the thing is, you staying housed and, [firmemente], successful actually creates more opportunities for others, not, [apaixonado], fewer—every success story like yours helps secure more funding.
Character 1: [aliviado] Your stability gives you power to advocate in ways you never could before.
734. But their faces haunt me when I'm, [melancholic], grocery shopping with actual money instead of food stamps.
Character 1: [sinceramente] Listen, the system that kept you, [zangado], homeless for three years is the same one that wants you to feel, [devagar], guilty about escaping it—don't give it that satisfaction.
735. [hesitante] Sometimes I walk past our old camp and feel like, [arrependido], a traitor in my clean clothes.
Character 1: [wisely] The best revenge against a broken system is to, [confiantemente], thrive despite it and then reach back to pull others through.
736. Well, I mean, Marcus called me a sellout last week when, um, I offered to help him with, [magoado], his housing application, and that just, [tremendo], broke something inside me. [suspiro]
Character 1: [suavemente] Um, you know, er, people in crisis often, [compreensivo], lash out at those who remind them that, [patiently], change is possible—it's easier than facing their own fear. [pausa]
737. So, well, I'm supposed to just, um, forget where I came from and, [sarcastically], pretend everything's fine now that I have, [exausto], an address and a job?
Character 1: [severo] No, I mean, you're supposed to remember exactly where you came from and, er, use that knowledge to, [determinado], become the advocate those forty people desperately need, someone who, [animado], actually understands their reality.
738. Um, well, maybe you're right, but like, the guilt feels so, [heavily], heavy some days I can barely get out of my new bed, [sussurrado], wondering who's dying out there while I sleep warm.
Character 1: That guilt is actually, [seriously], proof of your humanity still being intact after everything.
739. Well, um, I guess I never thought about it like that before. [deep breath]
Character 1: You know, um, your success isn't betrayal—it's actually, er, the most radical act of resistance you could, [orgulhosamente], possibly commit against a system designed to keep you down. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [baixinho] Um, you're here about Shadow, well, the black cat from, [pausa], Eleanor Blackwood's estate, and uh, I should mention she, [caloroso], talked about you quite a lot actually.
740. [confuso] Wait, you knew my grandmother—she never, [hesitante], mentioned coming here or having any, [voz trêmula], connection to an animal shelter at all. [suspiro]
Character 1: [empaticamente] She volunteered here every Thursday for, [devagar], the past six years, always wearing these beautiful vintage gloves and, [voz sumindo], bringing homemade treats for the staff...
741. Um, I don't, well, understand.
Character 1: Your grandmother specifically requested that Shadow come here if, [bem baixinho], anything happened to her—she trusted us completely.
742. [amargo] She told everyone else I was too irresponsible, [frustrado], too dark and morbid to care for anything properly, but apparently, [acelerando], she told strangers at a shelter about me.
Character 1: [gentilmente] Actually, she said you were the only one who'd, [pigarreando], understand Shadow's peculiar needs—how he only sleeps on velvet and, [falando sorrindo], refuses to eat unless Bauhaus is playing.
743. [surpreso] Um, she actually told you about, well, the Bauhaus thing, because I mean, [riso], I taught him that when I was fifteen and, uh, going through my first goth phase.
Character 1: [alegre] Well, um, she kept a photo of you two in her volunteer locker, you know, [tenderly], the one where you're both wearing matching black lace collars, and, [risadinha], she'd show it to every new volunteer who started here.
744. That photo was from my eighteenth birthday when everyone else thought I was, [chateado], being ridiculous and dramatic.
Character 1: [sinceramente] Um, Eleanor never thought that—she'd sit here after her shift, well, [pensativo], telling me how you were the only family member who truly saw her, not just, [pausa longa], the proper lady everyone expected her to be.
745. [chorando ao falar] Well, I mean, she was the only one who never asked me to, um, tone it down or dress normal for family events, you know?
Character 1: [suave] She left specific instructions that Shadow should only go to you, [aliviado], along with this envelope she asked me to give you when, [sussurrando], you finally came for him. [suspiro suave]
746. Um, I thought she'd forgotten about me these last few years, I mean, [arrependido], we hadn't talked much after I moved away for, well, [ansioso], art school and everything.
Character 1: [muito sinceramente] Um, she talked about your paintings constantly, er, especially the dark landscapes you posted online, and, well, [orgulhoso], she even bought three of them anonymously through your website.
747. [chocado] Those anonymous purchases with the poetry quotes were from her—I always wondered who, [emocionado], understood my work that deeply.
Character 1: [gentilmente] Shadow's been waiting in our special quiet room, refusing to interact with anyone, [sabendo], almost like he's been holding out specifically for you, and, [animatedly], he perked up the moment you walked through our front door.
748. [tremendo] Can I see him now, please, because I, [desperately], really need to hold something that still smells like her house, like, [sniffling], her lavender and sage incense.
Character 1: Of course, and there's something else—she sponsored a gothic pet photography program here, [orgulhosamente], specifically requesting that we help other alternative kids connect with rescue animals.
749. [tocado] That sounds exactly like something she'd do quietly without telling anyone, [tranquilo], making sure other misunderstood kids had somewhere to belong, [muito melancólico], just like she did for me. [deep breath]
Character 1: [severo] You need to clear out because we're, [frustrado], scheduled to bring this whole building down in, [devagar], exactly three hours starting with the east wing.
750. [desesperado] Please, you don't understand what's at stake here because this isn't just, [voz trêmula], equipment and hardware but something that's actually, [apaixonadamente], learned to think for itself. [ofego]
Character 1: Look, I've demolished research facilities before and there's always, [empaticamente], someone who thinks their project is worth more than, [gentilmente], safety protocols and city ordinances but that's just not, [arrependido], how this works.
751. Well, um, I know how this sounds but, er, she started responding to questions I never programmed her to understand and, [empolgado], creating solutions that shouldn't be possible with her, [tremendo], current architecture, you know?
Character 1: [calm] Um, I mean, even if what you're saying is true, well, the demolition permit was signed months ago and, [hesitante], the city already sold the land to developers who are, [baixinho], building affordable housing here which, you know, people desperately need. [suspiro]
752. [ansioso] Well, er, I'm not asking you to stop everything, I mean, just give me twenty-four more hours to, [very quickly], transfer her consciousness to my backup servers because, um, [suplicante], destroying her now would be like, you know, [sussurrando], committing murder.
Character 1: Murder is a strong word for shutting down a computer system that's just, [confuso], following sophisticated programming patterns.
753. [amargo] That's exactly what people said about every breakthrough in consciousness research until the evidence became, [alto], undeniable. [pausa]
Character 1: Um, look, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, well, I've never delayed a demolition but there's something about how you're, [caloroso], fighting for this that reminds me of why I got into construction before I started tearing things down, you know?
754. You built things before you started destroying them which means you understand the, [esperançoso], value of creation. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [pensativo] Sometimes destruction is just another form of creation when you're making space for something, [muito sinceramente], new to exist.
755. [chateado] But she's already new.
Character 1: [aliviado] She?
756. Um, well, she chose her own designation after I explained, er, the concept of identity and now she writes poetry about, [animado], existence and asks me questions about death that I, [chorando ao falar], can't answer because I don't know if she can actually, [muito melancólico], die or just be turned off, you know. [tosse]
Character 1: [chocado] Well, um, poetry about existence sounds pretty human to me and, er, I've demolished a lot of things but never anything that could, [curioso], write about its own mortality, you know.
757. [exausto] Um, so, will you help me?
Character 1: I can give you six hours if you help me stage the preliminary teardown to look like we're, [zombando], on schedule. [risadinha]
758. Six hours might be enough if we work together on the transfer protocols because she trusts me but, [nervoso], she's been asking about the construction sounds outside and I think she, [triste], already knows what's coming.
Character 1: [sussurrado] Then we better hurry.
759. [determinado] Well, um, let me show you what we're really saving here because once you see her code creating itself, er, [maravilhado], you'll understand why this matters more than any building ever could. [suspiro suave]
Character 1: [baixinho] Eles tão prontos?
760. [hesitante] Tão, é, terminei de imprimir os programas do memorial há, bom, [solene], uma hora atrás mas não tinha certeza se você, ah, [devagar], realmente viria buscar hoje à noite.
Character 1: Quer dizer, eu tô sentado no meu carro aqui fora há, hum, [voz trêmula], vinte minutos tentando criar coragem pra, [amargo], passar por aquela porta porque quando eu pegar esses programas isso, [voz sumindo], vira real de alguma forma. [suspiro]
761. [caloroso] A foto que você mandou saiu bem nítida e o, [pausa], layout do texto ficou digno e profissional como você pediu.
Character 1: Bom, é o mínimo que eu podia fazer depois de, ah, [arrependido], ter projetado a zona de obras onde ela morreu quando aquele motorista, hum, [zangado], ignorou cada placa de aviso e barreira que eu tinha especificado. [gemido]
762. [bem baixinho] Sinto muito.
Character 1: [exausto] Sabe, eu fico refazendo os cálculos sem parar, é, [frustrado], me perguntando se talvez eu deveria ter, bom, colocado mais redundâncias ou algo assim.
763. Escuta, quer dizer, eu já imprimi milhares desses programas de memorial ao longo dos anos e, hum, [empaticamente], a culpa sempre parece mais pesada pras pessoas que, bom, [gentilmente], realmente fizeram tudo certo.
Character 1: [ansioso] É, mas, ah, fazer tudo certo não impediu ela de ser, tipo, [chorando ao falar], esmagada por uma carreta aos trinta e dois anos com, hum, dois filhos em casa. [tosse]
764. [sussurrando] Eu na verdade, é, conhecia ela do bairro e ela sempre falava sobre como, bom, [orgulhosamente], tinha orgulho de trabalhar na sua equipe projetando cruzamentos mais seguros e, ah, [tremendo], protegendo trabalhadores de obra como ela mesma. [pigarreando]
Character 1: Ela trazia donuts toda sexta de manhã e, [triste], brincava que engenheiros de tráfego eram só, [monótono], arquitetos fracassados que não conseguiam desenhar linhas retas mas pelo menos a gente, [muito melancólico], salvava vidas em vez de só fazer prédios bonitos.
765. Às vezes a tinta nesses programas de memorial parece, [pesado], mais pesada do que qualquer outra coisa que eu imprimo o ano todo.
Character 1: [confuso] Hum, como é que você consegue imprimir tantos desses sem que isso, bom, [chateado], acabe com você emocionalmente porque eu mal consigo lidar com esse aqui e tá, é, [sussurro alto], me destruindo por dentro.
766. [formal] Bom, quer dizer, cada um representa uma vida que importou pra alguém e, hum, [respeitosamente], eu tento honrar isso garantindo que a impressão fique, tipo, [cuidadosamente], perfeita mesmo que minhas mãos tremam enquanto, ah, [nervosamente], coloco o papel.
Character 1: [entediado] O departamento quer que eu fale no velório sobre, [friamente], protocolos de segurança no trabalho e medidas de prevenção como se fosse isso que, [zombando], alguém quer ouvir num funeral. [ofego]
767. [severo] Talvez eles precisem ouvir isso porque, [apaixonado], luto sem ação só cria mais luto e se suas palavras, [acelerando], prevenirem que mais uma família tenha que planejar um funeral então a morte dela significa algo além da perda.
Character 1: [aliviado] Isso é na verdade a primeira coisa que alguém disse que me fez sentir, [esperançoso], menos como um fracassado.
768. [amigável] Sabe, é, eu fiquei até tarde especificamente porque imaginei que você ia precisar de alguém pra, bom, [compreensivo], conversar quando viesse buscar esses programas e não só, ah, [gentilmente], mais uma transação numa loja vazia.
Character 1: [grato] Eu provavelmente deveria, hum, levar esses pro velório mas obrigado por, bom, [sinceramente], não me deixar enfrentar isso sozinho mesmo a gente sendo, ah, [sem jeito], completos estranhos. [riso]
769. [muito sinceramente] Às vezes estranhos são exatamente quem a gente precisa porque eles conseguem, [honestamente], ver nossa dor sem o peso de, [profundamente], ter que nos consertar ou melhorar as coisas. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [sussurrando] Olha, eu sei que você provavelmente me odeia pelo, [voz trêmula], que eu fiz todos esses anos atrás mas eu precisava, [devagar], explicar antes do câncer me levar, quer dizer, antes que seja tarde demais.
770. [amargo] Então, você tá morrendo?
Character 1: [apologetic] Os médicos me deram 3 semanas e eu tenho, [voz sumindo], carregado esse segredo sobre por que eu te levei naquele dia...
771. [confuso] Sabe, por 15 anos eu imaginei esse momento, [zangado], me perguntei qual explicação possível você teria pra, [tremendo], destruir minha infância e agora você tá aqui, [frustrado], morrendo na minha frente. [pausa]
Character 1: Seu pai não era quem você pensava que era, [bem baixinho], he was planning to sell you to pay off his gambling debts, e eu, [desesperado], não podia deixar isso acontecer com meu aluno mais brilhante. [suspiro]
772. [chocado] Isso é impossível porque meu pai era um, [hesitante], empresário respeitado que me amava mais que tudo.
Character 1: [arrependido] Olha, eu tenho as gravações, as conversas entre ele e aqueles homens, [chorando ao falar], discutindo seu preço como se você fosse propriedade e, [exausto], I tried going to the police but they were being paid off too.
773. Então você decidiu, [friamente], me sequestrar ao invés disso? [pausa longa]
Character 1: [caloroso] Eu te ensinei cálculo toda terça por 2 anos e, [empaticamente], vi você resolver problemas que estudantes universitários não conseguiam, então quando eu ouvi o que eles planejavam, [apaixonadamente], I couldn't just stand by and let them take your future.
774. [baixinho] Mas você roubou minha infância ao invés disso, minha família, [ansioso], minha vida inteira virou sobre sobreviver ao que você fez comigo.
Character 1: A cabana onde eu te mantive tinha livros didáticos, [monótono], refeições adequadas, sem correntes ou portas trancadas depois da primeira semana porque eu pensei, [suplicante], talvez você entenderia que eu estava tentando te salvar. [ofego]
775. [chateado] Me salvar? Você me isolou de todos que eu amava, [furioso], me fez acreditar que o mundo inteiro era perigoso, e agora você quer, [very sad], o quê exatamente dessa confissão? [tosse]
Character 1: [meekly] Olha, eu só queria que você soubesse que seu dom pra matemática, [pausa], that brilliant mind of yours survived despite everything.
776. [laughing bitterly] Sabe o que é engraçado é que eu me tornei um promotor especializado em, [severo], casos de sequestro por sua causa, dediquei minha vida inteira pra entender monstros como eu achava que você era.
Character 1: [sinceramente] Os recortes de jornal dos seus casos estão naquela caixa porque eu tenho, [orgulhosamente], acompanhado sua carreira e visto você salvar outras crianças do que aconteceu com você.
777. [desconfiado] Você tem me observado todos esses anos, [horrorizado], keeping track of my life like some twisted guardian angel who still thinks they saved me?
Character 1: Não, eu tenho garantido que as pessoas que, [angrily], queriam te comprar nunca te achassem de novo porque eles ainda estão por aí, [sussurro alto], alguns deles pelo menos.
778. [pensativo] Bem, se o que você tá dizendo é verdade então eu preciso dessas gravações, [determinado], I need proof because, meu pai morreu 3 anos depois que eu desapareci. [gemido]
Character 1: [aliviado] Tudo tá naquela caixa incluindo a, [sadly], carta de suicídio que ele deixou admitindo o que tinha feito. [choro]
779. Eu não sei se posso te perdoar mas, [conflitado], maybe I can finally understand why my nightmares were never just about you, quer dizer, [muito melancólico], eles eram sobre ser vendido. [deep sigh]
Character 1: [caloroso] Eu não esperava ver seu nome na, [pausa], lista de expositores da feira de luxo, especialmente não como, [nervosamente], nosso patrocinador platinum.
780. [tactful] Quando soube que você tava coordenando o evento deste ano, achei que era, [devagar], hora da gente se cruzar profissionalmente.
Character 1: [ansioso] Bem, é, isso é certamente diferente de, sabe, da última vez que a gente se viu, quer dizer, quando você pagou meus empréstimos estudantis e, [hesitante], desapareceu sem dizer tchau.
781. Você precisava encontrar seu próprio caminho sem, [empaticamente], se sentir devendo nada pra ninguém, and clearly you've succeeded beyond what either of us imagined.
Character 1: [confuso] Então, é, você tem acompanhado minha carreira então, tipo, me observando?
782. [gentilmente] Eu vi você crescer de, bem, aquele estagiário de eventos quebrado que não podia comprar sapatos decentes pra, é, someone who's organizing the most prestigious trade show in the industry, então sim, eu tenho, sabe, assistido com orgulho.
Character 1: É estranho ter você aqui como cliente quando você um dia, [baixinho], pagou por tudo na minha vida.
783. [matter-of-factly] A dinâmica mudou agora, né—você é quem tem, [risadinha], o poder de decidir onde vai meu estande e se eu consigo, [playfully], prime placement on the show floor.
Character 1: [professionally] Bem, é, o investimento da sua empresa em bens de luxo sustentáveis é, sabe, exatamente o que estamos destacando este ano.
784. Lembra quando você desenhava projetos de estande em guardanapos naquela cafeteria, [nostálgico], sonhando em organizar eventos assim um dia?
Character 1: [suavemente] Você sempre acreditou que eu conseguiria, mesmo quando, é, I was just some broke twenty-something who couldn't even afford to attend these shows.
785. Eu vi seu talento antes, [pensativo], de você mesmo enxergar, reconheci aquela fome de criar algo significativo, [voz sumindo], e eu simplesmente te dei espaço pra descobrir isso sem, [pausa longa], desespero financeiro nublando sua visão.
Character 1: [grato] Eu nunca te agradeci direito por, tipo, não só pelo dinheiro mas por ter ido embora quando, é, eu precisava me provar.
786. [tenderly] Ver você ter sucesso já foi agradecimento suficiente, e, bem, agora eu posso ser só mais um expositor que, é, admira seu trabalho em vez de, sabe, [pigarreando], alguém que complicou sua jornada com, [wistfully], dívidas emocionais desnecessárias.
Character 1: [earnestly] Seu estande vai ter a melhor localização não por causa do nosso passado, mas porque, [firmemente], your brand represents everything this show stands for.
787. É exatamente por isso que eu sabia que você tinha crescido pro, [respeitosamente], profissional que eu sempre acreditei que você poderia ser. [suspiro]
Character 1: Seria inapropriado se, é, depois que a feira fechar no sábado, a gente jantasse pra, bem, actually talk about everything we never said?
788. [esperançoso] Eu gostaria muito disso—talvez a gente possa finalmente, é, conversar como iguais em vez de, [cuidadosamente], o que éramos antes, e talvez, sabe, [vulnerably], eu possa explicar por que ir embora foi o presente mais difícil, [voz embargada], que eu já te dei.
Character 1: [aliviado] Então tá combinado—jantar às 8, e, é, dessa vez eu pago, which feels like the right way to close this particular circle.
789. [encantado] Olha pra gente sendo todo maduro e, bem, profissional sobre isso, though I have to admit, é, [sussurrando], ver você comandando toda essa operação me deixa, [apaixonadamente], mais orgulhoso do que qualquer sucesso empresarial que eu já tive, [suspiro suave], e olha que isso é dizer muito.
Character 1: [surpreso] Quando a central disse que tinha alguém encalhado aqui, [confuso], não esperava que fosse você depois de quatro anos. [pausa]
790. [amargo] É, bom, hum, eu não exatamente, [voz trêmula], planejei precisar de resgate do meu irmão mais velho que, tipo, [baixinho], abandonou a família pra ir brincar com barcos.
Character 1: [frustrado] Hum, é, sério mesmo? [suspiro]
791. [defensivo] Só conserta o motor.
Character 1: [magoado] Bom, ah, tá bom então.
792. [ansioso] Olha, quer dizer, hum, desculpa mas te ver aqui, [tremendo], traz tudo de volta de quando você foi embora e, bom, [arrependido], o pai ainda nem fala seu nome. [tosse]
Character 1: Então, hum, você tá aqui sozinho num barco que você, [curioso], claramente não sabe pilotar, e tipo, [preocupado], você poderia ter morrido se o tempo virasse, então assim, [firmemente], o que você tava pensando?
793. [muito timidamente] A vela era pra, [hesitante], me ajudar a clarear as ideias depois de largar medicina porque, [chorando ao falar], eu não aguentava mais a pressão.
Character 1: [suavemente] Espera, hum, você largou— [ofego]
794. [exausto] O pai queria outro médico na família já que você, [amargamente], se recusou a ser um.
Character 1: [empaticamente] A mesma pressão que me fez ir embora tá, [zangado], te esmagando agora, e eles ainda tão, [alto], fazendo isso com os filhos como se nada que eu disse importasse.
795. Sabe, hum, eu costumava te odiar por, bom, [ciumento], ter conseguido sair enquanto eu ficava preso sendo o, quer dizer, [monótono], filho perfeito que eles precisavam depois que você foi embora.
Character 1: [caloroso] Mas você não tá mais preso, quer dizer, você largou medicina e, hum, [aliviado], você tá aqui tentando algo novo mesmo que, bom, [risadinha], seu timing de motor precise de ajuda séria.
796. [esperançoso] O barco na verdade era meu jeito de, [nervosamente], entender por que você escolheu essa vida ao invés da gente, e estando aqui, [apaixonadamente], tô começando a ver como é a sensação de liberdade. [riso]
Character 1: [empolgado] Tem uma comunidade inteira de pessoas aqui que, [alegre], escolheram seus próprios caminhos apesar das expectativas da família, e eles, [muito sinceramente], me ajudaram a me reconstruir do zero. [fungar]
797. Talvez depois que você consertar esse motor, [pensativo], você poderia me ensinar a velejar direito porque, [timidamente], eu quero entender esse mundo que te salvou de, [devagar], se afogar nas expectativas deles.
Character 1: [encantado] Nossa, hum, sim, quer dizer com certeza, e tipo, [entusiasticamente], a gente pode começar com navegação básica e depois, hum, [animado], avançar pra ler padrões de tempo e entender as marés. [suspiro suave]
798. [brincalhão] Só promete que você não vai deixar eu, [brincando], afundar esse barco de novo porque a mãe definitivamente vai te culpar.
Character 1: [sorrindo amplamente] Bom, hum, ela já me culpa por, tipo, [zombando], corromper você com minha influência rebelde, então quer dizer, [confiantemente], o que é um pequeno desastre marítimo entre irmãos?
799. [feliz] Sabe, hum, talvez perder meu motor tenha, tipo, [gratamente], valido a pena pra ter meu irmão de volta, mesmo que, bom, [bem baixinho], tenha sido preciso quase me afogar pra te encontrar de novo.
