Like, what if I walk in there tomorrow and discover he cooked the books so badly that we're actually bankrupt? [nervous laugh] HR said something about \"restoring trust\" and I just nodded like an idiot because, honestly, what do you even say to that?\n\n[bitter] The worst part? Everyone's going to look at me like I'm either the savior or, er, the next criminal waiting to happen. [determined] But I worked too damn hard for this. [pause] I'll fix whatever mess he left, implement every control he clearly ignored, and... [trailing off] \n\n[quietly] I just wish my first day wasn't going to be on every business blog tomorrow.
