=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: God, I can't believe I'm even thinking this, mas tipo... [confused] o jeito que ela olhou pro meu relógio ontem? When I mentioned the promotion, o rosto dela inteiro simplesmente— [pause] acendeu diferente. Não por mim. Pelo número. [bitter] And honestly, tô repassando cada conversa agora, sabe? Cada uma delas. [anxious] That time she asked about my investment portfolio on our third date—achei que ela tava, er, interessada na minha vida. [sarcastic] Right. Porque todo mundo discute hedge funds durante a entrada.

[hurt] The thing is, eu realmente—quer dizer, tô me apaixonando por ela. [very quietly] Like, really falling. Caindo de verdade. Forte. And now I'm sitting here wondering se cada risada foi real, se aquele beijo significou alguma coisa, se— [angry] Jesus, será que eu sou tão ingênuo assim? [frustrated] Her friends literally call me "the catch," não pelo meu nome. The catch. [laugh bitterly] Como se eu fosse um peixe fodido com etiqueta de preço.

[shaky voice] I keep hoping I'm wrong, que talvez eu tô só, hmm, sendo paranoico? But then she texted asking about vacation homes e— [sigh] a gente tá saindo há 6 semanas. [very sad] Six weeks and I thought this was real. [whispering] Eu realmente achei que era real.

Speaker: God, I can't believe I'm even thinking this, but like... [confused] the way she looked at my watch yesterday? When I mentioned the promotion, her whole face just— [pause] it lit up differently. Not for me. For the number. [bitter] And honestly, I've been replaying every conversation now, you know? Every single one. [anxious] That time she asked about my investment portfolio on our third date—I thought she was just, er, interested in my life. [sarcastic] Right. Because everyone discusses hedge funds over appetizers.

[hurt] The thing is, I actually—I mean, I'm falling for her. [very quietly] Like, really falling. Hard. And now I'm sitting here wondering if every laugh was real, if that kiss meant anything, if— [angry] Jesus, am I really that naive? [frustrated] Her friends literally call me "the catch," not by my name. The catch. [laugh bitterly] Like I'm some fucking fish with a price tag. 

[shaky voice] I keep hoping I'm wrong, that maybe I'm just, hmm, being paranoid? But then she texted asking about vacation homes and— [sigh] we've been dating six weeks. [very sad] Six weeks and I thought this was real. [whispering] I really thought this was real.
