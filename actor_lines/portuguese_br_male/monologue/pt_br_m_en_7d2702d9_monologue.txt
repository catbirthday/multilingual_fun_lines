Speaker [en]: [confused] I just—I literally cannot believe what just happened in there. Um, did they seriously just give the promotion to Derek? [bitter] Derek who's been here, what, six months? [pause] I mean, I've been doing solar sales for three years—THREE years—and they pick the guy who still asks me how to, like, calculate panel efficiency? [angry] It's just so—honestly, the thing is, I trained him! [frustrated] I actually sat there and taught him everything about, you know, residential installations, commercial systems, er, all of it. 

[sarcastic] But sure, yeah, give it to Derek because he's, what—[mocking] "bringing fresh energy to the team"? [sigh] That's basically what they said, right? Fresh energy. [sad] I guess my energy is just... old? [shaky voice] Here's the thing, I've closed more deals than anyone else in this department. Actually, no—[enunciating every word] more than everyone else combined some months. [quietly] And it's like none of that even matters because Derek played golf with the regional manager twice and suddenly he's—[trailing off]

[very sad] I don't know, maybe I should've seen this coming. [sniffle] It's fine. It's totally fine. I'll just, um, keep doing what I've been doing and, ah, pretend like this doesn't completely... [long pause] [whispering] God, this really hurts.
