=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [excited] Holy shit, it's actually happening—Atlantic Records wants to sign us! Like, an actual record deal, not some indie label nobody's heard of. [laugh] I keep reading the email over and over because, um, I can't believe this is real. [anxious] But here's the thing—they want us touring in two months, which means I'd have to quit at the firm. Quit quit. Like, [slowly], walk away from six years of stability, health insurance, my 401k... 

[sigh] Dad's going to lose his mind when I tell him I'm leaving a job that pays seventy grand to play bars across the country. And honestly? [hesitantly] What if we're just another band that gets dropped after one album? What if I—what if this is the biggest mistake of my life? 

[pause]

But then I think about sitting in that cubicle for another twenty years, you know, watching other people live their dreams on Spotify while I'm filing quarterly reports. [passionately] We've been playing "Bohemian Rhapsody" at wedding receptions for five years, and now we get to write our own songs, our own actual music! 

[confidently] I'm thirty-one. If not now, when? [very quietly] I think I have to do this. [smile speaking] No—I know I have to do this.
