Speaker [en]: [bored] So, um, just another Thursday doing my route, you know, same houses, same meters, same—wait. [curious] That's... hmm, that's not right. The thing is, I've been reading meters for, like, eight years now and I've never seen—[gasp] oh my God. Oh my God, that's literally sparking. [anxious] There's actual, I mean, there's exposed wiring just hanging from the meter box and it's—it's right next to the gas line. [very quickly] This is bad, this is really really bad, someone could, er, someone could die from this. [pause] Okay, okay, I need to, ah, I need to call this in right now. [loudly] Hey! Ma'am! Don't come any closer! [shaky voice] There's a, um, there's a serious electrical hazard here, just—just stay back please. Actually, you know what, everyone needs to get away from this area. [stern] I'm calling emergency services right now, this is, honestly, this is the worst thing I've seen. The homeowner had no idea, she was just, like, going about her day while this—[frustrated] how long has this been like this? [relieved] Thank God I noticed it, I mean, I almost walked right past it but something just, sort of, caught my eye. [anxious] They're sending someone immediately, but Jesus, this could have been catastrophic.
