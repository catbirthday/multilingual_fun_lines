Speaker [en]: [confused] What's this? I don't—wait, is this addressed to me? Um, I haven't gotten actual mail in, like, forever. [pause] "Dear Sarah, you probably don't remember me but..." [slowly] Oh my God, this is handwritten. Nobody does that anymore, right? [curious] "...when you held the elevator for me last Tuesday and asked if I was okay..." Wait, I—[gasp softly] I remember her. She was, you know, crying in the corner and I just... I mean, I didn't really do anything special. [warm] "You stayed with me for twenty minutes..." Did I? Honestly, I was just—er, it seemed like she needed someone. [shaky voice] "I had just lost my job that morning and was going to..." [pause] Oh. Oh no. [whispering] "...but your kindness reminded me that strangers can care." [sniffle] I had no idea she was—I mean, the thing is, I was literally just killing time before my meeting. [crying while speaking] "You saved me that day." I—[long pause] How do you not know? Like, how do you go through life not knowing you actually... [relieved] She's okay now. Says she got a better job and—[laugh] she named her rescue cat after me. [very sincerely] I just held a door. That's all I did.
