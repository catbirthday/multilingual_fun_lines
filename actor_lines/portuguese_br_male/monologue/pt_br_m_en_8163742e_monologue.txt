Speaker [en]: [shocked] I got the call twenty minutes after they arrested Richard. Twenty minutes! I mean, I'm literally sitting in my car outside headquarters right now and there's still news vans everywhere. [pause] They offered me the CFO position—my absolute dream job at Kellerman Industries—while my predecessor is probably, um, getting fingerprinted or something. 

[excited] God, I've wanted this role for five years! Five years of interviews, networking events, basically stalking their quarterly reports. [hesitantly] But this is not—this is not how I imagined it happening, you know? 

I keep thinking about all those spreadsheets I'll inherit. [anxious] What if there's more? Like, what if I walk in there tomorrow and discover he cooked the books so badly that we're actually bankrupt? [nervous laugh] HR said something about "restoring trust" and I just nodded like an idiot because, honestly, what do you even say to that?

[bitter] The worst part? Everyone's going to look at me like I'm either the savior or, er, the next criminal waiting to happen. [determined] But I worked too damn hard for this. [pause] I'll fix whatever mess he left, implement every control he clearly ignored, and... [trailing off] 

[quietly] I just wish my first day wasn't going to be on every business blog tomorrow. [sigh] "New CFO starts amid embezzlement scandal." Great headline, right?
