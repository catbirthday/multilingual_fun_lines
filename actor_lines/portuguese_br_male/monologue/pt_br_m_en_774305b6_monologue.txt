Speaker [en]: [gasp softly] They actually did it. They're rolling out my system to all two hundred and thirty stores. [pause] I mean, I knew the regional manager liked it when she visited last month, but [very excited] the entire chain! [laugh] 

God, remember when Tony made fun of me for color-coding the collection zones? [mocking] "Why are you trying so hard for minimum wage?" [bitter] Well, who's laughing now? [short pause] District manager, that's who I am now. District. Manager. [slowly] I keep saying it because, um, it doesn't feel real yet.

[warm] My mom cried when I told her. [sniffle] She was like, "Mija, you turned pushing carts into a promotion." [chuckle] And honestly, that's exactly what happened. 

[quickly] The efficiency went up forty-seven percent at our store—forty-seven! [animated] Less customer complaints, faster turnaround, employees actually liked the system because it was, you know, actually logical. [proud] They're calling it the Martinez Method in the training manual. 

[very quietly] Sometimes I still can't believe it. [pause] Four years of collecting carts in the Arizona heat, and I actually [speeding up] figured out something nobody else thought to fix. [extremely happy] District manager. Me. [belly laugh] Tony can kiss my promoted ass.
