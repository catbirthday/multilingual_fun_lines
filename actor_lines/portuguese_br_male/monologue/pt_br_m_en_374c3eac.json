And before I could even, you know, figure out the seating arrangement, your kid had already made space, shared their supplies, just... [very sincerely] It brought tears to my eyes, truly. And this happens constantly. They'll notice when someone's struggling with math and just, er, quietly offer help. Not in a show-offy way, but genuinely caring.

[pause] The other day, hmm, I dropped all my papers in the hallway—stack this high—and they stopped, helped me pick up every single one, organized them even. Didn't ask for anything, didn't need recognition. [short pause] You know what they said? \"You looked tired, Ms. Johnson.\" [voice breaking] In twenty-three kids, they're the only one who noticed. [proudly] Your child is going to do incredible things in this world. They already are."
