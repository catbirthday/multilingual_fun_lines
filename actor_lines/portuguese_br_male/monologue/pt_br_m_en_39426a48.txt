Subject: Reaching legend status in your profession and being invited to mentor the next generation

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [very quietly] They called me a legend today. [pause] Ha. Me, a legend. I keep, um... I keep replaying that moment when they asked if I'd mentor the next cohort. [warm] Twenty years ago I was sleeping on my friend's couch, practicing till my fingers bled, and now they're calling me— [trailing off] I don't know, it feels surreal. [chuckle] You work and work and suddenly you're the one people look up to? [anxious] What if I'm not ready for this? Like, teaching someone else how to... how to be great when half the time I still feel like I'm figuring it out myself. [slowly] But then I think about Marcus, my first mentor. He probably felt the same way, right? [smiling speaking] God, he'd laugh if he could see this. His scrappy little student becoming the, uh, the "established master" or whatever. [very sincerely] These kids coming up, they're hungry in a way that reminds me why I started. And maybe that's the point—not to have all the answers but to, mmm, to help them find their own. [confidently] Yeah. I think I can do this.
