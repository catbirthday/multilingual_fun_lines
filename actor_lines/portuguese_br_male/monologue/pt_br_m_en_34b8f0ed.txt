Subject: Your oyster harvesting methods producing the highest quality yield in the cooperative's history just as sustainable farming becomes profitable

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [excited] They just announced the numbers. The highest quality yield in forty-three years. [pause] Forty-three years. And it's... it's my beds. My oysters. [laugh] 

I keep thinking about all those meetings where they'd, um, where they'd roll their eyes when I talked about the nitrogen levels. [bitter] "Too expensive, takes too long, stick to what works." Right. [sigh] 

Five years I've been rotating the beds, letting them rest, testing the water every single morning at four-thirty. Everyone thought I was—well, honestly, they thought I was being ridiculous. [slowly] But now sustainable's the only thing buyers want. 

[very quietly] My grandfather used to say the bay tells you what it needs if you listen. [pause] I guess I just... I listened better than most. And now, with the new contracts coming in, everyone's asking how I did it. [chuckle] 

The thing is, er, I wasn't trying to be revolutionary or anything. [warm] I just wanted healthy oysters. Clean water. Something my kids could inherit that wasn't, you know, destroyed. [relieved] And now we're actually making money doing it right. Real money. For the first time in... God, maybe ever.
