Speaker [en]: [exhausted] God, I just... I keep replaying it in my head, you know? [short pause] Twenty million customer records, er, that's what we saved. Twenty million. [bitter] And all it cost me was, well, basically my best friend since college. [sigh] 

I mean, the thing is, when I saw those logs—[anxious] Jesus, when I realized it was Marcus's credentials being used for the breach attempt, I actually thought someone had, like, hijacked his account or something. [frustrated] But no, no it was him. It was actually him selling access to, um, to some ransomware group for what? [shouting] Fifty grand? [regretful] Fifteen years of friendship for fifty thousand dollars.

[very sad] He just sat there when I confronted him, wouldn't even—[trailing off] ... [long pause] The worst part is, honestly, I get it. His kid's medical bills, the divorce, I mean—[angry] No, actually, screw that. [confidently] I did my job. Protected the company, protected those customers. [whispering] But God, the look on his face when security escorted him out... [very melancholic] 

I keep thinking maybe there was another way, but—[hesitantly] there wasn't, right? There really wasn't. [crying while speaking] I had to report it, had to fire him, had to, um, had to do everything by the book because that's—[sniffle] that's what the job demands.
