Quit quit.

What if I—what if this is the biggest mistake of my life? \n\n[pause]\n\nBut then I think about sitting in that cubicle for another twenty years, you know, watching other people live their dreams on Spotify while I'm filing quarterly reports. [passionately] We've been playing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" at wedding receptions for five years, and now we get to write our own songs, our own actual music! \n\n[confidently] I'm thirty-one.
