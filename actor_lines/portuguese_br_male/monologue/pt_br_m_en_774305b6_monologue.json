[short pause] District manager, that's who I am now. District. Manager. [slowly] I keep saying it because, um, it doesn't feel real yet.\n\n[warm] My mom cried when I told her. [sniffle] She was like, \"Mija, you turned pushing carts into a promotion.\" [chuckle] And honestly, that's exactly what happened. \n\n[quickly] The efficiency went up forty-seven percent at our store—forty-seven! [animated] Less customer complaints, faster turnaround, employees actually liked the system because it was, you know, actually logical. [proud] They're calling it the Martinez Method in the training manual. \n\n[very quietly] Sometimes I still can't believe it.
