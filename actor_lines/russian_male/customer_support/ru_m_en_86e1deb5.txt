=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, so basically I'm having this—this really weird problem with my account?

Customer Support [en]: Hey there! I'm, uh, happy to help you out today. Let me just, hmm, pull up your account here. Can you give me your, um, email address or account number? I think it should start with ACC-something.

Customer [en]: Yeah it's, um, it's greenthumb47 at gmail. Sorry this is—I know this isn't your fault.

Customer Support [en]: No worries at all! Okay so, um, I've got your account here, ACC-7829-GH47, and I can see... hmm, that's interesting. There's, uh, there's a verification flag on here. What kind of, um, what kind of issue are you running into exactly?

Customer [en]: So like, I work in a greenhouse, right? And my phone gets, um, gets all humid and condensation and stuff.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, that's, uh, that's actually really fascinating! I don't think I've ever... hmm. So you're saying the, um, the humidity is affecting your phone?

Customer [en]: Yeah and so—so when I try to do the verification thing, it's it's not working. I'm probably doing something wrong.

Customer Support [en]: No no, I don't think it's you at all! This is, um, genuinely kind of a puzzle here. So let me check your verification attempts... okay so I can see, uh, three failed attempts today, codes VER-8829-X1, VER-8829-X2, and VER-8829-X3. Were you, um, were you able to see the codes on your screen clearly?

Customer [en]: Um, sort of? The screen gets all—all foggy and then like, the touch doesn't work right.

Customer Support [en]: That's so weird! I mean, uh, not weird in a bad way, just, hmm, technically interesting. You know what, I think the moisture might be, um, might be triggering false touches? Like the system probably thinks you're entering different numbers.

Customer [en]: Oh! That—that makes sense actually. Um, sorry for the trouble, I should've figured that out.

Customer Support [en]: Are you kidding? This is, uh, this is actually really cool to troubleshoot! I'm gonna, hmm, let me override this for you. Your case number is CSE-9947-HUM, and I'm putting a note about, um, about the greenhouse humidity thing because honestly? That's kind of amazing.

Customer [en]: You're—you're really nice about this. So basically what do I do now?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna, uh, send you a backup verification to your email instead. Code BKP-4421-EM. But also, and this is just me being curious, have you tried, um, maybe doing the verification like, outside the greenhouse? Or maybe in your car?

Customer [en]: Um, I—I haven't actually. That's, er, that's probably really obvious isn't it? I'm so stupid.

Customer Support [en]: No no no, absolutely not! I mean, when you're at work you're at work, right? Who's gonna think, oh let me, um, let me leave my workplace to verify my account? That's not obvious at all.

Customer [en]: So the email thing, that's—that's gonna work? Even with my phone being all, um, messed up?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah totally! So, um, the email verification bypasses the SMS system completely. Transaction ID TXN-5582-BYP is what I'm using here. And, uh, honestly? I'm kind of, hmm, I'm adding a permanent note to your account about the greenhouse thing so if this happens again, whoever helps you will, um, will already know what's up.

Customer [en]: That's so—wow, um, thank you. Really. I know this is a weird problem.

Customer Support [en]: Are you kidding? This made my day! I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna tell everyone about the greenhouse humidity case. Your reference number is REF-9983-GRN if you need anything else. And hey, um, maybe get one of those waterproof pouches for your phone? Just, you know, thinking out loud here.
