Customer [en]: Um, hello, I'm—sorry, my English is, uh, not so good. I try to explain, um, problem with... payment thing.

Customer Support [en]: So basically, um, there's absolutely no need to apologize for that, I can understand you perfectly fine, and uh, let me just pull up your account here—can you give me your business name or account number?

Customer [en]: It's, uh... Chen's Electronics. Maybe I say wrong? C-H-E-N. Sorry, I know my accent is... probably making this hard.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, perfect—Chen's Electronics, and um, I see your account here, ACC-4892-CE, so what I'm seeing is, uh, there was a payment attempt on the 15th that didn't go through...

Customer [en]: Yes! The—no wait—I mean, um, I think I put wrong number? Or maybe... what's the word... the, uh, expiry? Date?

Customer Support [en]: So like, that's exactly what happened, um, the card expiration date in our system shows 03/24 but the charge was declined because, uh, it looks like your card probably renewed recently, right?

Customer [en]: Oh! Yes, yes. New card. I'm so stupid, I should, um, I should know to update.

Customer Support [en]: So basically you're not stupid at all, this happens, like, literally dozens of times a day, and um, what we need to do is just update that info—do you have the new card with you?

Customer [en]: Um, yes, I have. Should I—let me just—sorry, finding it... okay. Ready.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so when you're ready just, um, give me the new expiration date and then, uh, we'll also need to verify the CVV code—that's the three digits on the back...

Customer [en]: Uh, it's... zero seven, no wait—sorry—zero eight. Two zero two seven. August 2027.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, 08/27, and um, now I just need that CVV to complete the update, and then so basically we can reprocess that payment today.

Customer [en]: Three... nine... four. I say too fast? Should I, um, repeat?

Customer Support [en]: No no, that's perfect—394, got it, and uh, I'm updating this now in your profile PFL-4892-CE-01, so like, give me just one second here while the system processes this and...

Customer [en]: You're so, uh, so patient. Thank you. I know I'm... probably taking long time.

Customer Support [en]: So honestly you're doing great, and um, actually this is going faster than most calls, so... okay, updated! Your payment for invoice INV-2847-Q just processed successfully, $847.50.

Customer [en]: Really? It work? Oh thank you, thank you so much! I was, um, so worry about this!

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely worked, and uh, you'll get a confirmation email at chen.electronics@email.com in like, the next few minutes with receipt number RCP-58271-CE, so basically you're all set now.

Customer [en]: You so helpful! Not like, um... not making me feel stupid for accent or... or mistake. Thank you, really.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, so like, you've got nothing to feel bad about—your English is perfectly clear, and um, these payment things happen to everyone, so... anyway, is there anything else I can help you with today?
