=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Good afternoon. I'm calling about my—no, sorry, your billing department has charged me—wait, let me start over. EPA certification renewal. Twice.

Customer Support [en]: Alright, so, um, let me just, like, pull up your account here. So basically what I need is, uh, either your certification number or, hmm, the email you registered with.

Customer [en]: It's under—sorry, the email is jmitchell dot hvac—no wait, that's the old one. Um, j mitchell seven seven at gmail.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. So, um, I'm seeing account ACC-4782-JM here and, like, yeah there's definitely, uh, two charges for the EPA renewal on June third. Both for, hmm, one twenty-nine ninety-five.

Customer [en]: Precisely. I need one reversed. Immediately, if that's—I mean, today. Please.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, so basically I've, um, seen this happen before. Like, the system sometimes, uh, double-processes when there's, you know, a timeout. Let me just, hmm, initiate that refund right now under reference REF-2024-67823.

Customer [en]: You can do that? Right now? Not the usual—sorry, I mean, no supervisor approval needed?

Customer Support [en]: Nah. So, um, anything under two hundred, I can just, like, handle it directly. The refund's, uh, already processing and you'll see it in, hmm, three to five business days.

Customer [en]: Um, that's actually—wait, you're already processing it? That's, uh, incredibly helpful. Thank you.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, while I've got you here, I'm, like, also gonna add a note to your file FIL-889-CERT about this so, uh, if it happens again—which it shouldn't—but like, we'll have the history.

Customer [en]: I genuinely—no, sorry, I really appreciate that. Most places make you jump through—I mean, um, this is refreshingly simple.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah well, so, HVAC techs deal with enough, uh, nonsense already, right? Like, between the heat and the, um, difficult customers. Don't need billing problems too.

Customer [en]: Um, exactly. It's ninety-eight degrees here and I've been—sorry, yeah, uh, you get it. This really helps.

Customer Support [en]: So basically your confirmation for the refund is, um, CNF-78234-RF and, like, you'll get an email about it in, uh, maybe an hour? Also, hmm, I'm seeing your certification expires in two months.

Customer [en]: Two months? I just—wait no, that's the, um, refrigerant handling one. Different cert.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. So, um, that one's cert number CRT-9982-RH and, like, just so you know, there's a, uh, bundle discount if you renew both at once. Saves you, hmm, forty bucks.

Customer [en]: Um, that's actually really—I mean, nobody's ever mentioned that before. Can you, uh, email me those details?

Customer Support [en]: Already typing it up. So basically I'm, um, sending it to your Gmail with the, like, bundle pricing under quote QTE-2024-88JM and, uh, it'll include the direct renewal links.

Customer [en]: You've been incredibly—no, specifically, um, getting the refund done immediately and, uh, mentioning the bundle? That's saved my whole day.

Customer Support [en]: Hey so, um, like I said, been doing this a while. Know what matters, you know? Your refund tracking is TRK-67823-JM if you need it, and, uh, stay cool out there. Literally.
