=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm—I'm calling because, uh, my dad passed away and I don't, hmm, I don't even know where to start with his account?

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Oh no. Let me—let me get you to the right place here. So first, I'm deeply sorry for your loss. Can you give me the account number?

Customer [en]: It's it's, um, let me see here... okay so I have all these papers and, uh, I don't know which one is—wait wait is it this one?

Customer Support [en]: Take your time. No rush at all.

Customer [en]: Umm, okay okay okay, so maybe it's, uh, 4-7-2... no that's that's something else, god why did he have so many accounts?

Customer Support [en]: So basically while you're looking, um, I can search by name too if that's easier? I'll need the full name as it appears on the account, and, um, the zip code would help narrow it down in our system here.

Customer [en]: Robert James Mitchell, um, zip is 44120 and, uh, hmm, what if there's multiple accounts though, like like what happens to all of them?

Customer Support [en]: Pulling that up... okay. Account ACC-44120-RJM-7829. Got one main account here.

Customer [en]: Just one? But but he mentioned, um, something about investments and, uh, I thought there were—oh god what if I'm missing accounts?

Customer Support [en]: So so let me do a deeper search here, um, sometimes they're linked but not showing... give me just a sec to check our investment portal... okay so I'm seeing, uh, three total. Main checking ACC-44120-RJM-7829, savings SAV-1098X, and, um, there's an investment account INV-77421-RM.

Customer [en]: Three. Okay. Okay so that means... hmm, how do I even, like like, what paperwork do you need?

Customer Support [en]: Right right. So um, basically for deceased account holders, we need—and I know this is a lot—death certificate, your ID, and, uh, either will documentation or court papers showing you as executor. Reference number for this is DCL-9982-1107.

Customer [en]: Executor? I'm I'm not—we haven't even, um, gone to court yet and the funeral home said the certificate takes like two weeks?

Customer Support [en]: Completely understand. This is—this is really overwhelming, I know.

Customer [en]: Um, so like, let me see here... can the account just stay open or or does it freeze or, uh, what happens to automatic payments?

Customer Support [en]: So so unfortunately the account does get restricted once we're notified, um, but but here's what I can do—I'll put a note, case number CSE-440187-PM, that keeps things in a holding pattern for 30 days. Bills marked "critical" like utilities can still process.

Customer [en]: Oh great, fantastic, so so his power gets shut off while I'm trying to—sorry, I just, this is all so much.

Customer Support [en]: No no, I hear you, um, this whole system is—honestly it's not set up well for for situations like this. Let me, uh, let me flag those specific bills so they keep going. Electric company, gas, water?

Customer [en]: Umm, yeah yeah yeah all of those and, hmm, what if... okay so that means the mortgage too right? It has to has to keep going?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. So I'm adding mortgage to the exception list under CSE-440187-PM, and um, basically any critical payment. You can call back with this case number and, uh, add more if needed. Again, I'm so sorry you're dealing with all this.
