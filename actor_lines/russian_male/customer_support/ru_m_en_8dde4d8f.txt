=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: [exhales] Right. Hi. Vendor payment's stuck. Need help fast.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, let me just pull up your account here and, uh, basically I can already see what's—oh yeah, so there's like a payment pending to, umm, let me see... FlourMill Direct under transaction TXN-948271-QM and it's, uh, showing as failed but not really failed, more like...

Customer [en]: Failed but not— wait, I'm— actually, what? Sorry. Brain's fried. 4am start.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, totally get it. So basically what happened is like, um, the payment TXN-948271-QM tried to process but, uh, your bank put a hold on it because, hmm, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's, um, twenty percent higher than your normal weekly order, so...

Customer [en]: Oh thank God. Thought I— yes, bigger order. Holiday rush starting.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, perfect. So, um, I'm gonna just, uh, basically bypass that and— sorry, let me— I mean, I'll mark this as verified merchant activity under code VMR-7792-X so like, um, future orders won't get flagged even if they're, you know...

Customer [en]: Um, that's so, uh, helpful, seriously, like you have no idea how much I—

Customer Support [en]: Oh, and so, um, while I'm in here, I'm seeing like three other payments that might, uh, hit the same issue? Your sugar supplier and, umm, two others. Want me to just, er, preemptively clear those under batch approval BAT-5581-KL?

Customer [en]: Yes! Please! Um, I could just, like, cry right now. Thank you so—

Customer Support [en]: Already done.

Customer [en]: [sharp inhale] You're amazing. Can I— no wait— is there a survey? Need to tell someone.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, there will be a survey but like, honestly? Let me, uh, let me also set up something better for you. I'm gonna, um, put you on our merchant priority list under code MPL-2847-BX which basically means, er, any payment over your normal threshold gets, like, auto-approved instead of flagged, so you won't have to...

Customer [en]: Umm, wait, that's a thing? Why don't, uh, why don't they tell us about—

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, technically it's like, not advertised? But, uh, for businesses processing, hmm, let me see your volume... yeah over 50 transactions monthly, which you're at, um, 73 last month according to report RPT-9102-M, so you definitely qualify and honestly should've been on it already but...

Customer [en]: This is insane. Good insane. I'm so— thank you. Really.

Customer Support [en]: So, ummm, one more thing and then, uh, then you can get back to your ovens— I'm also gonna, like, send you a backup payment method form, it's BPM-4429-YT, and if you just, er, fill that out when you have time, any future issues would just, um, automatically roll over to your backup and you'd just get a notification instead of...

Customer [en]: I could— honest to God— name a croissant after you.

Customer Support [en]: [laughs] That's, um, that's definitely a first. So, uh, everything should process within, hmm, the next hour? You'll get confirmation texts for TXN-948271-QM and the three others, and, um, going forward you shouldn't have any more of these, er, these kinds of holds because the MPL status is already active as of... yep, right now.

Customer [en]: Um, you just, like, saved my whole week. My suppliers were gonna— never mind. THANK you.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, so, um, before you go? Save this reference number just in case: REF-6623-PLK. If you ever, uh, hit another payment snag, just, like, give them that and they'll see you're priority status and, um, basically fast-track everything. And seriously, er, good luck with the holiday rush, I know it's...
