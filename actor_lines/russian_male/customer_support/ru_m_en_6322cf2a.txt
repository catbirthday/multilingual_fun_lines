=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Hi, I'm calling about my mom's account, I think there's something wrong with her billing?

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Okay. Let me—no wait—I need to, um... the account number. Do you have it? Should be like ACC and then some numbers.

Customer [en]: She's eighty-two and gets confused with this stuff, so I usually help her out. The account is under Dorothy Chen?

Customer Support [en]: Right right. Found it. ACC-5582-DMC. So there's a—how do I... there's a note here. About authorization. I need to, uh, verify you're listed?

Customer [en]: I think I'm on there as her authorized contact? She added me last year when she had that mini stroke.

Customer Support [en]: Checking checking. Oh. Um. I see you—Michael Chen? Listed October. That's good. So the billing issue is... what's the word... it's showing double charges. For three months. $247.89 each. That's—I'm really sorry about that.

Customer [en]: Three months? She probably didn't even notice, she barely checks her statements anymore.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah that's—I mean—that happens. With elderly customers. Not their fault. At all. So the total is, uh, $743.67 in overcharges. Reference OVR-2847-KBN. I can process the refund?

Customer [en]: That would be great, I mean, she's on a fixed income so every dollar kind of matters right now.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely absolutely. Starting it now. Transaction TRX-9823-QWE is processing. Should hit in 3-5 days. But also—let me just—there's something else. Her plan.

Customer [en]: What about her plan? Is something wrong with that too?

Customer Support [en]: Not wrong. Just. She's on our, um... legacy unlimited? From 2018? Paying way too much. The new senior rate—code SEN-DISC-55—that's like half the price. Same features.

Customer [en]: Oh. She probably has no idea there's even a cheaper option.

Customer Support [en]: Right. Happens all the time. So I'm gonna—wait let me—actually I can switch her right now. New plan PLN-4429-SR starts next cycle. Saves her... calculating... $58 monthly.

Customer [en]: That's really helpful actually, between her medications and everything else, that'll make a difference.

Customer Support [en]: Good good. Also setting up—what do you call it—the monitoring? Alert code ALT-7736-FAM. You'll get emails if anything weird happens. Double charges. Plan changes. Whatever.

Customer [en]: I really appreciate this, I worry about her getting taken advantage of, you know?

Customer Support [en]: Totally understand. My grandma—same thing. So everything's fixed. Refund REF-2983-XLP is processing. New plan active. You're all set.

Customer [en]: Thank you, this is probably the best customer service call I've had in years, honestly.

Customer Support [en]: Just doing my job. But, uh... yeah. Take care of your mom. The confirmation—CNF-8827-DMC—that's going to both emails. Yours and hers.
