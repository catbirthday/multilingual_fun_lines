=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Um, I need to talk to you about something that's, [confused], incredibly awkward and I'm not even sure how to, [embarrassed], explain it but, well, one of our residents has been, [shaky voice], living in your garden shed. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] I've been noticing things moved around and thought it was, [frustrated], raccoons or maybe neighborhood kids but you're telling me it's been a, [loudly], person this whole time?

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Marcus checked himself in three months ago and he's been doing, [warm], really well in the program except for this. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, how does someone just, [angry], decide to move into a stranger's shed when, um, they're supposed to be in your facility?

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Er, he said your shed reminded him of, [crying while speaking], his childhood treehouse where he felt safe before everything went wrong, and um, he's been going there at night to, [trembling], journal and process his recovery. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] This is a violation of my privacy and honestly I should be, [anxious], calling the police instead of having this conversation with you about, [bitter], enabling this behavior.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, well, I understand.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Although now that I think about it, nothing's been, [curious], damaged or stolen has it? [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] He actually fixed your lawnmower.

Character 2 [en]: I wondered why it suddenly started, [surprised], working again after, um, being broken for six months—I mean, he fixed it?

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Um, Marcus was a mechanical engineer before his addiction took everything, and well, [sad], he's been trying to make amends in small ways.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] My brother went through something similar and, um, I remember how he'd, [melancholic], find these strange sanctuaries during his recovery that didn't make sense to anyone else but, well, [regretful], helped him heal somehow. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Would you consider letting him explain?

Character 2 [en]: I suppose I should at least, [hesitantly], hear what he has to say, I mean, before deciding whether to press charges.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Um, that's more understanding than most people would be, and, well, [sincerely], I promise this won't happen again. [clearing throat]

Character 2 [en]: [formal] I need to set some boundaries here because this whole situation has left me feeling, [upset], violated in my own home even if his intentions weren't malicious, and I can't just, [firmly], pretend it didn't happen. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] Er, of course, and um, we'll implement whatever measures you need to, [professional], feel safe again. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: Um, bring him by tomorrow afternoon and, well, [nervously], we'll discuss how to move forward properly.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] He left you a letter explaining everything and apologizing for the intrusion, [emotionally], which I should have mentioned earlier but I was too nervous about this whole conversation to think, [exhausted], straight about what order to say things.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Well, um, okay then.
