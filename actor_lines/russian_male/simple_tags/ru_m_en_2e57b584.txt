=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stern] David, open the door, I know you're in there and I need to, [frustrated], verify that you're safe because you've missed three check-ins and that's, [anxious], not like you at all.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] There's no point in pretending anymore because they, [trembling], already know where I am and it's just a matter of, [very quietly], time before everything falls apart like it always does.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Look, um, nobody's been following you, er, I've had surveillance on your place for weeks and there's, [relieved], absolutely no indication of any threat. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: You can't see what's coming because you're, [hesitantly], trained to look for obvious dangers but the real threats are, [whispering], invisible until it's too late and then, [monotone], everyone acts surprised.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] David, I mean, I understand you're scared, well, but barricading yourself inside and cutting off contact is, [loudly], exactly what will get you killed. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: Um, you know, every person who ever said they'd protect me has, [angry], either died or abandoned me so, I mean, forgive me if I don't trust your promises. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I've been your handler for five years now, er, and I haven't let anything happen to you yet, [passionately], have I?

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] Um, yet. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] So, um, I'm not leaving this doorstep until you let me in, I mean, even if it takes all night because that's, [determined], my job.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Well, um, fine. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Thank you for trusting me with this because I know how, [sincerely], hard it is for you to believe that things might actually, [hopefully], work out okay. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastic] Oh sure, um, everything's going to be sunshine and rainbows just because the, [mocking], brave Marshal showed up to save the day like some, er, kind of movie hero, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I'm not trying to be a hero here, I'm just trying to, [shaky voice], keep you alive long enough to see that not everything ends in disaster.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] The last time I believed that was before I testified and look where, [crying while speaking], that optimism got me—living under a fake name in a town where nobody knows who I really am.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] But you're still breathing and that's something worth, [confidently], fighting for even when it feels pointless. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Breathing isn't the same as living and you, [upset], know that as well as I do because you've seen what this, [bored], protection program does to people over time, [slowly], grinding them down until there's nothing left. [sneeze]

Character 1 [en]: [curious] What if I told you there's been a development in your case that might, [excited], change everything?

Character 2 [en]: [skeptical] Developments in my world only move in one, [furious], direction and that's toward catastrophe so whatever you think you have is probably just another false hope.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] Well, um, the main guy who wanted you dead was, er, found guilty on all charges yesterday and he's going away for, [very excited], life without parole which means, um, you might actually be able to start over for real. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Um, people like him have long reaches from prison, you know, and I mean, even if he's locked up, [whispering loudly], his friends aren't so this changes absolutely nothing about my situation. [cry]
