Scenario: A rotoscope artist working on medical footage for a documentary meets the recovered patient whose near-death experience they've been animating for months.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [concentrated] Um, I've been tracing your recovery footage frame by, well, [slowly], frame for three months now and, um, [quietly], seeing you standing here in person instead of on my screen is, [shaky voice], somehow completely different. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The documentary producer said someone was, [carefully], turning my worst moments into animation but I didn't expect to, [trembling], meet the person who's been studying every detail of when I was, [whispering], dying. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: That's, [muted], exactly it.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I mean, it's strange knowing someone has watched me, er, [anxious], at my absolute weakest hundreds of times over, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, [exhausted], every frame matters. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So, um, when you're rotoscoping someone's trauma, I mean, [bitter], do you ever think about how they're, well, [relieved], actually alive now instead of just, er, [crying while speaking], frozen in that terrible moment?

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] The way your hand trembled in frame 247 when the nurse, [stuttering], couldn't find your vein haunts me every single day.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, that particular moment when my body was, [frustrated], shutting down is something I've tried to, uh, [coldly], forget but you've memorized it, hmm?

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I've drawn your face in pain so many, [regretful], times that seeing you smile now feels like witnessing something, [shocked], impossible or maybe even sacred in a way.

Character 2 [en]: The animation you're creating from my, [angry], suffering will help thousands of people understand what, [empathetically], recovery actually looks like beyond the statistics. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [formal] Every line I draw carries the weight of knowing you, [passionate], survived what I'm depicting frame by meticulous frame. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, sometimes I watch the rough cuts and, umm, [confused], can't believe that skeletal figure was actually, [monotone], me just six months ago when everything was, er, [trailing off], touch and go...

Character 1 [en]: [shy] Um, I've spent so many hours with your medical footage that, well, [nervous], I feel like I know you but we've never, umm, [very sincerely], actually met until right now, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Well, um, it must be surreal animating someone's, er, [sad], near-death experience and then having them, [cheerful], walk into your studio completely healthy, hmm?

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Um, your eyes in the footage were so, well, [hollow], empty but now they're absolutely, er, [excited], blazing with life and I don't know how to, umm, [whispering loudly], reconcile these two versions. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] That person in your animations was, [desperate], fighting to stay alive with every labored breath.

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] The way you're standing here breathing normally makes all those, [tearful], hours of tracing ventilator tubes and, [grateful], IV lines feel both pointless and profoundly meaningful.

Character 2 [en]: [very meekly] Um, well, would it help if I showed you the, er, [hopeful], scars that prove everything you've been animating was, [proudly], real and that I actually, umm, [animated], survived it all? [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Yes, because right now my brain can't process that you're, [stunned], the same person whose heart stopped three times in the, [devastated], footage I've been rotoscoping for what feels like forever.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Every frame you draw with such precision is proof that, [firm], modern medicine works and that people like me can, [joyful], come back from the edge of death.
