Scenario: A housekeeper pleads with a grid operator who arrives to disconnect power at an estate where the elderly owner depends on electric medical equipment to survive.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Excuse me, you can't disconnect the power right now because Mrs. Henderson is, [trembling], on oxygen upstairs and needs the electricity to stay alive.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] I understand, um, your concern but, well, the account is, [frustrated], six months behind and I have a work order that, [quietly], I really need to complete today, you know.

Character 1 [en]: The family's accounts are frozen because, um, of the legal battle over, [anxious], her son's embezzlement but I mean, she's ninety-two and, [shaky voice], completely innocent in all this financial mess that's, [crying while speaking], destroying everything she built.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Look, I, uh, don't make these decisions, I just, well, [empathetically], follow the disconnection orders that come through the system, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Please don't do this.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I've been doing this job for fifteen years and, [slowly], never had to cut power to someone on, [very quietly], life support equipment before this moment today.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] There must be, um, some emergency protocol or, well, [passionately], medical exemption form we could file to, [quickly], buy us more time, I mean. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] The company has a critical care registry but, [stern], it requires documentation from a physician and, [formal], approval from three different departments.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] I have, um, all her medical papers upstairs and, well, I mean, [exhausted], I've been managing her care alone since the family, [bitter], abandoned her when the money troubles started. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] If you can, um, show me the oxygen prescriptions, I might, well, [carefully], be able to delay this for seventy-two hours, you know. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You don't know, um, what this means because I've been, [emotional], paying for her medications myself and, well, [tearfully], watching her fade a little more each day, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] My grandmother died alone in a nursing home while, [regretful], I was too busy working overtime to visit her regularly and, [sadly], I still haven't forgiven myself.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Mrs. Henderson keeps asking about her son even though he, [angry], stole everything and left her with nothing but, [whispering loudly], I can't tell her the truth about what he did. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I'll just, uh, report a, [nervous], technical delay.

Character 1 [en]: She still believes he's coming back to visit next month and, [melancholic], sets a place for him at dinner every Sunday like, [monotone], nothing ever happened and the FBI never, [shocked], raided this house. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] I'm going to, um, call my supervisor and, well, [confidently], tell them the disconnection can't be completed due to, uh, critical medical circumstances, you know. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You would risk your job for a stranger when even her, [disgusted], own family won't return my calls about her condition or, [very sad], help with her care anymore.

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes doing the right thing means, um, breaking protocol and I'd rather, well, [firmly], lose my job than have someone's death on my conscience, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Thank you for seeing her as a person and not just, [kindly], an overdue account number in your system.

Character 2 [en]: Let's get those medical forms together and, [optimistic], figure out a longer-term solution for keeping her power on.
