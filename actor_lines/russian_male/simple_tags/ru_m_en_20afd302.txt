=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Oh my God, um, is that really you standing there, [warm], arranging those apples like you used to, well, arrange your comic books by issue number, [trailing off], back when we thought we'd both leave this town together, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Still recognize me.

Character 1 [en]: I've been writing algorithms that simulate human decision-making for five years now, but seeing you here, [quietly], makes all that work feel suddenly meaningless.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] These tomatoes need more attention than most people, [hesitantly], realize, checking for bruises and ripeness while everyone else just, [sarcastic], rushes past to grab whatever's convenient. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I didn't mean to sound like I was, [anxious], judging your work—God knows my research feels more abstract and, [confused], disconnected from real life every single day. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: Well, you know, at least my work feeds people directly, um, instead of teaching machines to, [coldly], replace them.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] That's not what I'm doing, I mean, we're trying to augment human intelligence, not, [passionately], replace it, though I guess that distinction doesn't matter much, um.

Character 2 [en]: You still talk in abstractions while I deal with, [stern], concrete things—this lettuce wilts in exactly three days and these bananas ripen at, [slowly], predictable rates that don't require any artificial intelligence to understand.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Um, maybe that's what I've been missing, you know, the tangible results, [empathetically], the immediate feedback of whether something is ripe or rotten, [whispering], instead of wondering if my models will ever actually, er, help anyone.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] They help someone somewhere.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Remember when we used to sit behind the store eating, [nostalgic], bruised peaches your dad couldn't sell, planning how we'd change the world together, [trembling], before I left and you stayed to take care of your mom.

Character 2 [en]: Those peaches were perfectly good, just not, [wistfully], pretty enough for customers who judge everything by appearance.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Your mother would be proud that you kept the family business alive and, [emotionally], maintained something real in this increasingly digital world.

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Um, well, proud.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I've been developing this agricultural AI system, um, that could predict optimal harvest times and, [excited], reduce food waste by thirty percent, but I need someone who actually, [hopefully], understands produce to make it work, you know.

Character 2 [en]: So you want my twenty years of, um, real experience to train your, [skeptical], machines, like I'm just another data point in your, well, research. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] No, I mean, I want your expertise to ground my work in reality, [shaky voice], to bridge this gap between what I study in labs and what you, [very quietly], know from actually touching the earth, um, every single day.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtfully] Well, the thing is, um, every piece of fruit tells a story about soil and weather and, [curious], human care that your algorithms might miss, but maybe there's something worth, [animated], exploring in combining what we both know, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [happy] You'd really consider working together after all this time, [eagerly], after I abandoned our plans and left you here alone to handle everything, [crying while speaking], including your mother's illness and the store's struggles.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe we both ended up exactly, [perceptive], where we needed to be, learning what we needed to learn, um, so we could meet again like this and actually, [confidently], build something that matters. [deep pitch]
