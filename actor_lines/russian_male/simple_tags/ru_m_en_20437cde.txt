=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] The teleprompter just went completely haywire and now it's showing, [shaky voice], random code instead of my stats for the game. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Um, that's not random code, I mean, someone's actively, [stern], hijacking your broadcast system right now and, well, they're trying to, [very quietly], access the network's financial data through your connection.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Um, well, what?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Look, um, I know this sounds crazy but, [quickly], I can stop them if you trust me enough to, [empathetically], let me access your terminal right now, you know? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, I mean, we're live in three minutes and, [frustrated], I don't even know who you are besides some tech person who just happens to be here.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] I'm actually here because, um, your producer hired me to test your security systems, but well, someone else, [passionately], beat me to finding this vulnerability.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] So you're saying, um, you can fix this and, [excited], get us back on air without anyone knowing we almost got hacked? [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [purposeful] I'm already isolating the intrusion vector and building a firewall around your broadcast feed to, [calmly], protect the live stream.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Thank God.

Character 2 [en]: [tender] Um, we're good, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, I've called hundreds of games but never had to, [nervous], rely on someone behind the scenes to, [grateful], literally save the show while also protecting, well, thousands of viewers' credit card data.

Character 2 [en]: [believing] The thing about live broadcasts is they create these beautiful, [animated], vulnerable moments where technology and human trust have to, [slowly], work together perfectly or everything falls apart instantly. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [smiling speaking] Well, after this is over, um, I owe you more than just, [sincere], a thank you, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [playful] Just promise me you'll actually read those security updates I'm going to, [friendly], send you instead of clicking dismiss like you've been, [mocking], doing for the past six months.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] You can see my email habits too while you're, [embarrassed], fixing all this chaos I probably could have prevented?

Character 2 [en]: Only the security logs which show you've been, [gently], ignoring every warning the IT department sent about password strength and, [bitter], two-factor authentication requirements.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] After watching you work this magic in real time, I'll, [determined], implement every single security measure you recommend.

Character 2 [en]: [proud] Good, because, um, the hackers are getting more sophisticated and, well, next time we might not be so, [quietly], lucky to catch them before they do real damage, you know? [groan]

Character 1 [en]: Thirty seconds to air and my heart is still, [trembling], racing from almost losing everything.

Character 2 [en]: [reassuring] You're clear now and I'll be monitoring everything from here to make sure nothing else, [protective], happens during your broadcast. [sniffle]
