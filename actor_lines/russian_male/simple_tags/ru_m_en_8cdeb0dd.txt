=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Well, um, I never thought I'd be standing here after, [shaky voice], fifty years of hating you, I mean, wondering if you'd even want to see me now.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] You came after all this time, [whispering], even though I destroyed everything we built together and, [regretful], stole the patents that should have been ours.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] The nurse said you've been asking for me, [hesitantly], every single day for the past three weeks.

Character 2 [en]: Um, there's something I need to, [anxious], tell you before it's too late, something about, [very quietly], what really happened with the investors back then, you know, [crying while speaking], the truth you never knew.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What truth could possibly matter now after you took, [frustrated], everything and left me with nothing but debt and, [angry], a reputation in ruins?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Well, um, they threatened my daughter, I mean, [shaky voice], the mob had compromising photos of her and said they'd, [whispering loudly], ruin her life if I didn't, you know, [trailing off], sign everything over to them through that shell company.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] You're telling me the hostile takeover wasn't, [very sad], your idea but you let me believe for, [passionately], five decades that you betrayed me out of, [slowly], pure greed?

Character 2 [en]: I, um, couldn't risk telling anyone, especially you, because, well, [empathetically], they said they'd kill us both if I ever, [terrified], revealed the truth about who really owned the company after, you know, [mumbling], the papers were signed.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] So, um, all those years I spent hating you, well, [upset], planning my revenge and cursing your name at every family gathering were, [very melancholic], based on a lie you had to tell to, I mean, [pause], protect your child.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, yes.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, why didn't you ever try to, [quietly], hint at the truth, you know, send some kind of signal over all these years?

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Well, um, every time I tried to reach out, [clearing throat], you'd already moved or changed your number, and honestly, I mean, [deeply sad], watching you hate me was easier than, you know, [sigh], risking your life by telling you the truth.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Um, so you sacrificed our friendship, our business, everything we'd built since college, [choking up], to protect your daughter from those monsters, and, well, [whispering], never once thought I might have helped you fight them, you know, [long pause], if you'd just trusted me enough to tell me.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Um, would you, really?

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] We invented three breakthrough technologies together before thirty, [proudly], revolutionized an entire industry from your garage.

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Yeah, well, look where all that innovation got us, um, [bitter], you living in subsidized housing and me dying alone in, I mean, [hoarsely], this sterile room with no one but nurses who don't even know my real name.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetic] Well, um, your daughter must have survived though, I mean, [hopefully], if your sacrifice worked then at least she got to live the life, [trembling], you wanted for her, you know?

Character 2 [en]: She died ten years ago in a car accident, [monotone], never knowing why her father became the villain everyone said he was.

Character 1 [en]: [devastated] Oh God, um, I'm so sorry, I mean, all of this suffering for nothing then, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [peaceful] Not for nothing because now you know the truth, [warm], and maybe you can stop carrying that hatred, [very quietly], let it die here with me in this room, [deep breath], finally.
