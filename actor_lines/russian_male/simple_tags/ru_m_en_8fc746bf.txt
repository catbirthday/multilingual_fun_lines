Scenario: An optimist inventor meets with a patent examiner who has just rejected their revolutionary happiness-measuring device for the third time.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [excited] Well, um, I know you've seen this device before but, [cheerful], I've made some really significant improvements that I think, [nervously], will address all your concerns this time, er, I really believe we're onto something revolutionary here! [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Yes, I, uh, remember your previous submissions quite clearly, and while I appreciate your, [frustrated], enthusiasm, the fundamental issues with measuring abstract concepts like happiness remain problematic.

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] But, um, that's just it!

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, I understand you're passionate about this, [sarcastic], but passion doesn't make something scientifically viable or, [formal], eligible for patent protection under current regulations. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] I completely understand your position and I know, [empathetically], this must seem like just another wild invention, but what if I told you, [animated], that three major universities have already validated my methodology?

Character 2 [en]: Academic validation is one thing, but, [monotone], the patent office requires demonstrable utility and, [bitter], after twenty years in this job, I've seen countless inventors claim they've revolutionized human understanding only to, [regretful], disappoint themselves and their investors. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Have you ever wondered though, what if one of those rejected inventions, [passionate], could have actually changed the world if you'd just given it a chance?

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Every single day.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] So, um, you do understand then—I mean, that's why I keep coming back here because I know, [joking], somewhere behind that bureaucratic exterior beats the heart of someone who, er, wants to believe in possibility.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Listen, I, well, I don't mean to be discouraging but, [shaky voice], the truth is that hope and reality rarely align in this office, um, and I've learned to protect myself from disappointment. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] But that's exactly why this device matters—it doesn't just measure happiness, [anxiously], it helps people understand what truly brings them joy so they can, [whispering], rebuild their capacity for hope even after disappointment. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] You know, um, in all my years here, I've never had an inventor, [mocking], no wait that's not right—I've never had someone, [deep pitch], actually articulate why their invention matters beyond profit margins, er, the way you just did. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [hopefully] Does that mean—

Character 2 [en]: [confused] I shouldn't be saying this, but your persistence, [trailing off], it reminds me of why I became a patent examiner in the first place...

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] To help bring meaningful innovations into the world, to be part of something, [sleepily], no wait I'm getting ahead of myself—to witness the moment when, [gasp], an idea becomes reality?

Character 2 [en]: [cough] Well, um, perhaps we should review your improvements one more time, and I mean, [very quietly], really examine them with fresh eyes this time, er, without my usual skepticism getting in the way.

Character 1 [en]: You're saying there's, [belly laugh], actually a chance?

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] I'm saying that, um, sometimes optimism is contagious, and maybe, [playful], just maybe this office needs a device that measures happiness more than, [sniffle], I care to admit, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [delighted] This is exactly what I've been trying to explain—that hope isn't naive, [very excited], it's necessary for innovation, and sometimes all it takes is, [loudly], one person willing to believe!

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Well then, let's, er, schedule a formal review for next week, and, [sincerely], bring all your documentation because if we're going to do this, [whispering loudly], we're going to do it right, hmm, even if it means challenging the entire patent system's approach to abstract concepts. [groan]
