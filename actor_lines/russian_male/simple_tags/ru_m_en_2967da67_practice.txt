=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Please don't scream.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Oh my god, there's a, [confused], talking frog in my champagne fountain and this is, [excited], definitely not the party trick I had planned for tonight! [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] I know this looks, um, [anxious], completely insane but I need to tell you something about, well, your grandmother before everyone, uh, notices me here.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] My grandmother has been, like, [hesitantly], dead for twenty years so whatever you're, um, selling or whatever this performance art thing is, I mean, [amused], you've got my attention.

Character 1 [en]: She wasn't just your grandmother, she was, [bitter], Madame Evangeline the witch who cursed me three hundred years ago and, [quietly], you're my last hope.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, you're telling me that, um, [skeptical], my sweet grandma who baked cookies was actually, like, a centuries-old witch and, well, [nervous], you're her victim?

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] The curse can only be broken by, [whispering], someone from her bloodline who believes in impossible things, and watching you throw these elaborate parties where, [passionate], anything seems possible made me think maybe you could understand.

Character 2 [en]: [playful] So, um, you've been, like, watching me throw parties while being, uh, [uncomfortable], a frog this whole time? [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: [embarrassed] I mean, it's not like I had, um, [frustrated], many entertainment options living in your garden pond for the past six months while, well, [melancholic], trying to work up the courage to approach you, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Okay, so like, um, [thoughtful], hypothetically if I believed you, which I'm not saying I do, but, I mean, [intrigued], what exactly would breaking this curse involve?

Character 1 [en]: Your grandmother left journals in the attic that, [urgently], describe the reversal ritual but it requires, [frightened], genuine belief and apparently something called the midnight garden bloom which only, [trailing off], appears during a full moon party.

Character 2 [en]: [animated] Well, um, tonight's actually a full moon and, like, [cheerful], I do throw the best parties. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] So you'll help me even though, um, [vulnerable], this sounds completely ridiculous and, well, [quietly], I'm literally a frog asking you to, er, believe in magic? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] You crashed my party.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] The fountain seemed like the most, [apologetic], dramatic entrance and you always say you want your parties to be, [wistful], unforgettable experiences that change people's lives forever. [laugh softly]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] My grandmother did always say, um, [mischievous], our family had secrets and, like, [determined], if there's even a tiny chance this is real, well, we're doing this.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Even if it doesn't work and, um, [worried], I'm stuck like this forever, just having someone, [emotionally], actually listen instead of trying to, well, [sadly], catch me for a science experiment means everything.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Look, I've thrown parties for, like, [gently], actual royalty before but helping an enchanted frog prince might be, um, [enthusiastic], my greatest hosting achievement yet, so let's go find those journals. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] After three centuries of people either, [bitterly], running away screaming or trying to dissect me for, [exhausted], scientific study, you're the first person to just accept this.

Character 2 [en]: Life's too short to not, well, [wisely], believe in a little magic, especially when there's a talking frog in my fountain. [long pause]
