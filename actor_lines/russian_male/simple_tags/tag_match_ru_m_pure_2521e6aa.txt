=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [с сожалением] The collective knows I'm here, they can feel my, [тревожно], hesitation through every shared thought, and the weight of their, [дрожащим голосом], disappointment is overwhelming even as I sit here discussing, [тихо], severing our connection forever. [вздох]

Character 2 [pure]: [тепло] I understand this must be incredibly difficult, and while I've counseled many patients through, [сочувственно], life-changing medical decisions, yours is uniquely complex.

Character 1 [pure]: We've been together for, well, [смущённо], twenty-three years since the integration, and um, every memory, every feeling has been, [горько], shared among the seventeen of us, but I mean, lately I've been craving something they, [замолкая], can't understand...

Character 2 [pure]: [принимая] Well, um, the procedure costs three hundred thousand dollars, and I mean, [строго], insurance companies don't recognize consciousness separation as, [нерешительно], medically necessary, so we'll need to explore, like, [медленно], alternative financing options.

Character 1 [pure]: [шёпотом] The others think I'm betraying everything we've, [страстно], built together.

Character 2 [pure]: [профессионально] I mean, there are medical loans available, and um, [раздражённо], some foundations that support, well, [очень тихо], what they call identity autonomy cases, though the approval process can take months.

Character 1 [pure]: [дрожа] Every night, um, when we dream together, I feel myself, [громко], drowning in their thoughts, you know. [пауза]

Character 2 [pure]: [мягко] Well, I've seen how this decision weighs on patients, and um, [спокойно], the financial burden shouldn't be your only consideration here.

Character 1 [pure]: [защищаясь] You know, they're listening right now through me, um, [сердито], judging every word you say, every, like, [говорит сквозь слёзы], suggestion you make about helping me leave them, and I mean, I can't shut them out. [вздох]

Character 2 [pure]: [искренне] The payment plans we offer can be structured over, [обеспокоенно], fifteen years with options for deferment if, [сочувственно], you experience adjustment difficulties post-procedure.

Character 1 [pure]: [изнурённо] Sometimes I wonder if the person wanting to leave is even me anymore, or if it's just, [монотонно], a malfunction in our neural linking that makes me feel, [очень грустно], so desperately alone even while surrounded by, [громким шёпотом], sixteen other consciousnesses.

Character 2 [pure]: [задумчиво] Well, er, have you considered that, [аккуратно], the collective might actually help with the costs, I mean, if they understand it's what's best for everyone?

Character 1 [pure]: They've already voted, and um, [с горечью], eleven believe I should stay regardless of my suffering, you know.

Character 2 [pure]: [с облегчением] Well, there's also a new pilot program that, um, [оптимистично], covers experimental consciousness procedures for cases involving psychological distress.

Character 1 [pure]: [отчаянно] I just need to know if I can afford to be, [с надеждой], alone again, to have thoughts that are only mine without feeling, [меланхолично], their constant presence.

Character 2 [pure]: [сочувственно] I mean, based on your financial assessment, we could, er, [уверенно], get you approved for partial assistance within six weeks. [долгая пауза]

Character 1 [pure]: [подавленно] Well, um, even if I leave, I'll always carry the echo of what we were, like, [ностальгически], phantom limbs of consciousness that, you know, [грустно], ache for connection I chose to sever.

Character 2 [pure]: [успокаивающе] The procedure includes twelve months of therapy to help with that, [доброжелательно], exact adjustment process you're describing.

Character 1 [pure]: [смирившись] Schedule the financial screening then, before I, [испуганно], lose my nerve.

Character 2 [pure]: [нежно] I'll start the paperwork today, and um, [ободряюще], remember that choosing individual consciousness isn't betrayal, well, it's just choosing a different way to exist.
