Scenario: An overworked attorney, alone on her office rooftop at 3 AM, encounters a conscious shooting star in its final moments before burning up in Earth's atmosphere.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I should be reviewing these patent claims but, [slowly], I can't stop watching you fall through the atmosphere, [gasp softly], burning so beautifully against the darkness.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Strange to find someone watching at this hour, [shaky voice], most humans miss my final performance because they're, [trailing off], sleeping or lost in their screens. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Well, um, I haven't slept properly in weeks, so, uh, maybe witnessing your descent is, [anxious], some kind of cosmic consolation prize for, [very quietly], insomnia.

Character 2 [en]: You speak of consolation prizes while, um, I'm literally dying here, you know, burning away into nothing but light and memory, err, which I suppose has its own poetry. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Poetry—that's rich coming from celestial matter that gets to, [passionately], exit in a blaze of glory while the rest of us, [frustrated], just slowly burn out in fluorescent-lit offices, [very melancholic], filing motions nobody will remember.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Oh but you're wrong, I mean, every document you file contains someone's dreams, umm, their inventions and ideas, [whispering], the things they hope will outlive them, [loudly], just like my light outlives me, well, even as I disappear.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Maybe you're right, um, but lately I feel like, [mumbling], I'm just protecting corporate interests instead of actual innovation, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Listen, I've traveled through space for millennia, er, witnessing countless civilizations, and, well, [speeding up], every single one needed someone to guard their spark of creation, [regretful], even if the guardians forgot why they were guarding. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering loudly] Tell me something.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] The beauty isn't in the permanence of things, [deep pitch], it's in the fierce determination to create despite knowing everything ends, [relieved], including this conversation we're sharing right now.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] God, I used to believe that, umm, back when I thought law could change the world, but, well, [crying while speaking], now I just feel like I'm drafting footnotes to other people's, [monotone], brilliance. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Footnotes matter more than you think, like, um, without gravity's subtle pull I'd never have found Earth, [high-pitched], never have this moment of consciousness before dissolving, [animated], and without your work, hmm, ideas would vanish as quickly as I will. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I'm sorry you have to spend your last moments listening to, [very sad], a burned-out lawyer complaining about intellectual property law when you're, [stuttering], literally burning up.

Character 2 [en]: It's perfect actually, um, because we're both burning, [sarcastic], just at different speeds. [short pause]

Character 1 [en]: [sleepily] You know, well, I came up here to jump, but, umm, [confused], watching you fall with such grace makes me think there might be better ways to burn.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] There are infinite ways to burn, and, err, the slowest ones often leave the most light behind, [joking], though I admit mine is more dramatic, like, [very excited], but yours—protecting ideas—that's the kind of fire that, well, builds civilizations.

Character 1 [en]: I never thought about it that way, hmm, that maybe the tedium is just, [cheerful], another form of sacrifice for something bigger, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] Of course it is, and anyway, when I'm gone in about thirty seconds, well, [formal], someone will wish upon my light not knowing I was conscious, [playful], not knowing we had this conversation, umm, but maybe you'll remember. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: I'll remember every word, and tomorrow when I'm reviewing those patents, [hopeful], I'll think about how even dying stars believe in protecting, [clear throat], human creativity.

Character 2 [en]: Then my death means something beyond just a pretty light show, and, um, your life means something beyond just paperwork, [whispering], and maybe that's enough for both of us, well, [enunciating every word], to keep burning in our own ways.
