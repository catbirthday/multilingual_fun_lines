Speaker [en]: [bitter] So they're finally admitting it now. After, what, twenty years of calling me backwards? [laugh] The studies are in, apparently—family dinners actually do matter, kids need structure, community ties are essential for mental health, all of it. Everything I kept saying while they rolled their eyes at me. [sarcastic] How wonderfully timely, right?

I mean, uh, the thing is—nobody even cares anymore. Like, the research papers are literally confirming what I argued at every damn PTA meeting, every neighborhood council, and it's just... [sigh] who's even reading them? Everyone's already moved on to, I don't know, virtual reality parenting or whatever the hell comes next.

[frustrated] My daughter called yesterday, you know? She's raising her kids with AI assistants and meal replacement shakes, and honestly, when I tried to mention the new findings she just—[trailing off] she said "that's nice, Mom." 

[sad] That's nice.

I was right about all of it. The importance of, um, real conversations, shared meals, knowing your neighbors' names. And here's the thing—[long pause] being right feels exactly like being wrong when nobody's around to notice the difference anymore.
