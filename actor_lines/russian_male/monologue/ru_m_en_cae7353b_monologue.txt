Speaker [en]: Thirty-seven years I've been fixing trumpets and trombones. [sad] Thirty-seven years, and now I'm sitting here with, um, maybe two repairs this whole month. [sigh] You know what kills me? I still remember when September meant chaos—kids flooding in with dented bells, stuck valves, parents panicking because little Johnny's concert is tomorrow and his slide won't budge. [warm] God, I loved that rush, even when I complained about it. 

[pause] 

Now it's all—I mean, schools are cutting music programs left and right. [frustrated] They say there's no budget, but somehow there's money for a new scoreboard, right? [bitter] And the kids, they don't even want to play anymore. It's all about, uh, coding clubs and robotics and whatever. [very melancholic] Which is fine, I guess, but music used to mean something. [trailing off] It used to...

[very quietly] I had a kid come in last week, maybe twelve years old, with his grandfather's cornet. The grandfather passed. Kid doesn't play, just wanted it polished up to display. [pause] That's what instruments are becoming—decorations. Museum pieces. 

[angry] Sometimes I want to march into these school board meetings and just— [exhausted] but what's the point? They've already decided. Music is extra. Optional. [cry] My whole life's work is becoming obsolete, and er, nobody even notices we're losing something beautiful.
