=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [triumphantly] They all said I couldn't do it alone. Каждый человек на той встрече такой типа, "тебе нужно коллаборировать, тебе нужен инпут, ты не можешь просто—" а я сижу и думаю, м-м, вообще-то могу. [chuckle] And I did! Всё целиком, от начала до конца, просто я и мои инстинкты. [pause] I mean, it wasn't about being stubborn, это было... не знаю, я просто так ясно всё видел в голове, понимаешь? Вижн был прямо там, а пытаться объяснить его всем бы просто, э... всё бы размыло. [confident] Sometimes you have to trust yourself even when literally everyone is telling you you're wrong. [sigh] Though honestly? Были моменты в типа 3 утра, когда я думаю, "Боже, а что если они правы?" [nervous laugh] What if I'm just being, не знаю, высокомерным или типа того. But then yesterday when I presented and saw their faces—вау. Просто полный шок. [proud] Sarah actually said it was the best work she'd seen in five years. Пять лет! [softly] And yeah, okay, часть меня хотела бы разделить эту победу с кем-то, но... [trailing off] I guess that's the price of doing things your way.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [triumphantly] They all said I couldn't do it alone. Every single person on that team meeting was like, "You need to collaborate, you need input, you can't just—" and I'm sitting there thinking, mm, actually I can. [chuckle] And I did! The whole thing, start to finish, just me and my instincts. [pause] I mean, it wasn't about being stubborn, it was... I don't know, I could see it so clearly in my head, you know? The vision was there, and trying to explain it to everyone would've just, uh... it would've diluted everything. [confident] Sometimes you have to trust yourself even when literally everyone is telling you you're wrong. [sigh] Though honestly? There were moments at like three AM where I'm thinking, "Oh God, what if they're right?" [nervous laugh] What if I'm just being, I don't know, arrogant or whatever. But then yesterday when I presented and saw their faces—wow. Just complete shock. [proud] Sarah actually said it was the best work she'd seen in five years. Five years! [softly] And yeah, okay, part of me wishes I could've shared this victory with someone, but... [trailing off] I guess that's the price of doing things your way.
