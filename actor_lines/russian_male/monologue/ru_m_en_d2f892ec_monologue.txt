With literally nothing but, like, a couple brushes and his truck. [frustrated] And now they're telling me that, uh, chimney cleaning is somehow—what was the word they used? [sigh] "Non-compliant with current emissions standards." I mean, we're literally cleaning chimneys to make them safer, right? [bitter] But apparently the soot disposal methods are, er, problematic. 

[warm] God, I still remember being, hmm, maybe seven years old, and Grandpa would let me ride in the truck with him. [shaky voice] He'd say, "This'll all be yours someday, kiddo." And honestly, I was so proud of that. [angry] Now I'm supposed to just, what—tell our twelve employees that they're done? That the EPA basically decided we're, I don't know, environmental criminals or something? 

[very sad] The thing is, we tried to adapt. Really, we did. New equipment, certifications, the whole thing. [slowly] But it's like... thirty thousand dollars just for the new disposal system they want. [laugh] Thirty thousand. Where exactly am I supposed to—[very quietly] We barely made that in profit last year. [trailing off] I just don't know how to tell Mom that everything Grandpa built is just...
