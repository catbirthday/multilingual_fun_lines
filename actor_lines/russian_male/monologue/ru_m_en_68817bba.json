You know, when I started in die casting, I was making, um, car parts mostly. Engine blocks, transmission housings, that kind of thing. [pause] But this? These tiny pieces are going to be inside someone's heart. [quietly] Inside someone's actual heart.\n\nI keep thinking about—well, about the surgeons who'll use these. They won't even know my name, right? But I'm the one who, uh, who checked every single measurement. Three times actually. Maybe four on some of them. [nervous] Because what if... what if I missed something? What if one component was just slightly off and I didn't catch it?\n\n[sigh] No, that's not—I mean, that's why we have the protocols. The testing, the quality control, all of it. But still, it's... hmm, it's different when you know these aren't just parts anymore. Someone's grandmother, someone's kid, they're going to depend on what I made today. [proudly] And they're perfect. Every damn one of them is perfect.\n\n[very sincerely] I guess that's why I stay late checking everything. Not because anyone asks me to, but because... I don't know, because I can't not care about it, you know?"
