[shaky voice] The thing is, I've noticed something on the packing floor that might, er, actually save us time. [pause] We keep moving the same boxes twice because of how the conveyor is set up, and I mean, [speeding up] if we just switched the order of stations three and four, we could literally cut out that whole redundant step. [short pause] I've been timing it, and, uh, it's like fifteen seconds per package that we're wasting. [excited] That's actually huge when you think about our daily volume! Anyway, I made some notes—[hesitantly] I mean, if anyone wants to see them. [warm] Sarah, you were right, this wasn't so bad. [relieved] Oh God, I actually did it. [laugh] My hands are still shaking but I—wow, okay. [proud] I finally spoke up. [sigh] That felt... really good actually."
