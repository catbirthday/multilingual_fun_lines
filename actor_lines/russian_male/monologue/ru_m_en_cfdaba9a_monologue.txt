=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] You know what's funny? I spent, um, fifteen years dodging customs agents, and now—well, now those same skills are literally saving lives. [pause] I mean, yesterday we had medical supplies sitting at the border for what, six hours? Because some bureaucrat needed, like, the right stamp on page seventeen of some form. Meanwhile, er, kids are dying from infections that could be treated with basic antibiotics.

[frustrated] So I did what I do best—found the guy's supervisor's personal number, you know? Told him I had a journalist friend who'd love to hear about delays. [chuckle] Suddenly, hmm, those supplies moved real fast. 

The thing is, I never thought my old contacts would be, [slowly], helping earthquake victims. But here we are. That route through the mountains I used for—well, anyway—it's perfect for bypassing the main roads that got destroyed. [relieved] And honestly? My guys, the ones I used to work with, they're all volunteering their trucks now. 

[warm] Yesterday this little girl, she got insulin because we, um, "creatively interpreted" some import regulations. [sigh] Twenty years of breaking rules, and finally—finally—it actually means something good.
