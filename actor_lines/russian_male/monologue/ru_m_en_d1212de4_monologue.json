The dosing calculation was completely wrong and it was already through, um, three approval stages. [relieved] She stayed late Friday night, and honestly, she didn't have to double-check those numbers but something just, [pause], something bothered her about them. \n\n[anxious] We were literally twelve hours from shipping. Twelve hours! To, uh, to pediatric hospitals across six states. [whispering loudly] Thousands of kids would've gotten five times the safe dose. [gasp softly] I mean, can you even imagine? The liver damage alone would've been—[trailing off]\n\n[crying while speaking] Sarah saved those children. She really did. And the thing is, [sniffle], she's so humble about it. Like, \"Oh, I was just doing my job.\" [frustrated] No! That's not just doing your job, that's, er, that's being exceptional. [warm] I submitted her for the company safety award, obviously, but honestly? [passionately] She deserves so much more than that.\n\n[very quietly] I keep thinking about all those parents who'll never know. [long pause] They'll give their kids medicine tomorrow and it'll be safe, and they'll never realize how close we came to—[shaky voice] God. [relieved] Thank God for Sarah. Thank God she was paying attention."
