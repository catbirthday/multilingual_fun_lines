When the whole team would pile into that cramped conference room and Sarah would bring those terrible donuts from the place downstairs and we'd just... [very melancholic] we'd actually talk to each other. Not through Slack or some corporate portal, just... talking.\n\n[bitter] Now it's all integration meetings and synergy discussions and, uh, \"aligning with their corporate values.\" Whatever that means. [pause] Mark's already talking about his next venture, how this is just the beginning, but I'm sitting here looking at our old whiteboard—the one where we wrote our first, hmm, our first real breakthrough at like 3 AM—and I just feel... [very quietly] I feel like we sold something that wasn't supposed to be sold, you know?\n\n[crying while speaking] Those people trusted us. We promised them we were building something different. [sniffle] And now they're all getting reassigned to different departments and I'm supposed to smile through exit interviews and tell them this is, um... this is a good thing."
