[frustrated] I was literally on my lunch break, sitting in the trailer, eating my stupid sandwich.\n\n[sarcastic] But oh, apparently being the senior operator means I should have, um, \"maintained better oversight of junior staff.\" [laugh] Right. Because I'm supposed to be psychic now. [very loudly] How was I supposed to know Kyle would be that monumentally stupid?\n\n[exhausted] The thing is, uh, nobody wants to hear it. HR, the union rep, even my own supervisor—[trailing off] they all just keep saying the same thing... [mocking] \"liability issues,\" \"insurance requirements,\" \"company policy.\" \n\n[sad] My kids don't—they don't understand why daddy can't drive the big machines anymore. [sigh] And honestly? I can't explain it to them because it doesn't make any damn sense. [quietly] Seven more years until retirement, and now I'm basically starting over. [pause] Filing appeals that'll probably go nowhere, while Kyle—[bitter] Kyle still has his job. [shaky voice] It's just not—it's not fair, you know?"
