Speaker [en]: [frustrated] I just got off the phone with, um, with Marcus, and I—honestly, I can't even process this right now. [pause] He took the five thousand, the whole loan that was supposed to be for, you know, inventory for his food truck, and he... [angry] he gambled it. All of it. [sigh] At the casino, apparently. Like, how do you even—I mean, we had a business plan, [upset] we had spreadsheets, projections, everything looked so legitimate. And the thing is, [quietly] I really believed in him, you know? His story about, uh, about supporting his family and building something real. [bitter] God, I feel so stupid. I should've seen the signs, maybe? [confused] But there weren't any signs, that's what's so... [trailing off] I don't know. [long pause] The worst part is, like, this isn't just my money—it's the platform's money, it's other people who, [shaky voice] who trusted me to make good decisions. And Marcus, he was crying on the phone, saying something about, er, trying to double the money to expand faster, and then it just... [groan] spiraled. [sad] I get it, kind of, the desperation, but... [angry] but that wasn't his choice to make! That money had a purpose. [exhausted] Now I have to figure out how to, um, how to report this, what to tell the committee. [sigh] Five years doing this work, and this is my first real... [pause] disaster.
