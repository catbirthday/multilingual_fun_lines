I mean, last week's blizzard? [anxious] Tommy's sled wouldn't have made it to that family if I hadn't caught that fuel line issue. Three kids, hypothermic, and we're talking minutes that matter. [long pause] Sometimes I lie awake thinking about what happens if I miss something.

[chuckle] My wife thinks I'm obsessed. "It's just volunteer work," she says. Just volunteer work? [frustrated] Every bolt I tighten, every belt I replace—someone's life might depend on it. Actually, no, [stern] someone's life WILL depend on it.
