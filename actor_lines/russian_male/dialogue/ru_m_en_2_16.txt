Character 1 [en]: Excuse me, are you using all six of these balls?

Character 2 [en]: Oh! No, no, I'm just, um, testing them out. See, I have this theory that bowling balls have personalities and you have to find one that, you know, likes you. This purple one definitely hates me though.

Character 1 [en]: That's... actually kind of brilliant. Mind if I join you? Lane seven's been broken for an hour.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, sure! I mean, fair warning, I'm basically terrible. Like, spectacularly bad. But in a way that's almost, erm, entertaining? I've hit other people's lanes twice tonight already.

Character 1 [en]: How do you even hit other people's lanes?

Character 2 [en]: Well, it's actually a gift. You have to throw with just the right amount of, uhh, chaotic energy. Plus these rental shoes are clearly conspiring against me. They're like, two different sizes or something.

Character 1 [en]: I haven't laughed like that in months. I'm Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: Sam. And, gosh, thanks for not running away when you saw my, um, unique bowling form. Most people see me wind up and suddenly remember urgent appointments. It's basically like watching someone try to throw a turkey.

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] My wife used to say I bowled like I was angry at the pins.

Character 2 [en]: Used to? Oh. That's... yeah, I get it. My ex and I came here every Thursday for three years. Now I come alone and, well, terrorize innocent bowling balls apparently. It's actually kind of therapeutic once you embrace the chaos.

Character 1 [en]: Is that why you're here at eleven PM on a Tuesday?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, caught me. Tuesday nights are when the serious bowlers aren't here to judge my, erm, interpretive bowling style. Plus the night guy, Roberto, he basically lets me have my emotional support nachos without asking questions.

Character 1 [en]: Emotional support nachos?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely. See, when you bowl a gutter ball, that's one nacho. Strike in the wrong lane? That's like, three nachos. And when you accidentally throw the ball backwards, which yes, I've done, that's just... you eat the whole plate.

Character 1 [en]: You threw a bowling ball backwards?

Character 2 [en]: Okay so, in my defense, I was trying this new technique I saw on YouTube and, uhh, the ball was really slippery and honestly physics just abandoned me completely. Roberto still has the security footage. He plays it when he needs cheering up.

Character 1 [en]: Can you teach me your chaos method?

Character 2 [en]: Wait, really? You actually want to learn how to bowl badly? Because I gotta say, I've basically perfected the art of, um, magnificent failure. Last week I knocked down exactly one pin in an entire game. One! That takes skill.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I need some magnificent failure in my life right now.

Character 2 [en]: Well then, Marcus, prepare yourself for the most gloriously terrible bowling of your life. First rule is, erm, forget everything you know about form. Second rule is embrace the gutter. And third? Always, always blame the shoes.
