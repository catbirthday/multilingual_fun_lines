Character 1 [en]: So, um, what if we, you know, combined a Boehm system flute with, err, electronic sensors like a Roland Aerophone?

Character 2 [en]: That's fascinating! You'd essentially be creating a hybrid acoustic-digital instrument that could maintain the traditional fingering system while opening up entirely new sonic possibilities through MIDI integration and sound processing.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly! We could embed pressure sensors under each key pad.

Character 2 [en]: The technical challenges would be, well, significant though - you'd need to, um, preserve the acoustic properties while, actually, integrating the electronics without affecting the bore or tone holes' resonance.

Character 1 [en]: Right, so, I was thinking, uh, maybe use the Straubinger pads but, you know, modify them with conductive material?

Character 2 [en]: Brilliant! Straubinger's synthetic pads are, hmm, already more consistent than traditional felt, and, I mean, adding a thin conductive layer could, basically, turn each pad into a capacitive sensor.

Character 1 [en]: And we could route the wiring through the mechanism posts like Miyazawa does with their brögger system.

Character 2 [en]: Yes! The brögger mechanism's pinless design would give you more internal space for electronics, plus Miyazawa's precision engineering would ensure the modifications don't compromise the mechanical action.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, what if we, err, partnered with Powell Flutes and, you know, used their Aurumite material for, um, better conductivity?

Character 2 [en]: Powell's Aurumite 9K would be perfect for this - the gold and silver alloy already has excellent acoustic properties, and the conductivity would eliminate the need for separate wiring in many components.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, I'm imagining, sort of, a collaboration between Yamaha's electronics division and, well, maybe Brannen Brothers for the mechanical innovation?

Character 2 [en]: That would be an incredible partnership! Brannen Brothers already does revolutionary work with their Cooper scale modifications, and Yamaha's experience with their Silent Brass technology could translate perfectly to this hybrid flute concept.

Character 1 [en]: We could debut it at the National Flute Association convention in Phoenix.

Character 2 [en]: Oh sure, because nothing says [sarcastic] "respect tradition" like showing up at NFA with a cyborg flute that would make Jean-Pierre Rampal spin in his grave.

Character 1 [en]: Hey, James Galway uses amplification all the time! This is just the next evolution.

Character 2 [en]: You're right, and honestly, someone like, uhh, Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull would, you know, absolutely love this - he's been, basically, pushing flute boundaries since the seventies.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly! So, we could, um, get Emmanuel Pahud to test it with the Berlin Philharmonic and, I mean, see how it handles Mozart's Concerto in D Major?

Character 2 [en]: Now that would be a true test! Pahud's technical precision combined with the Berlin Phil's acoustic standards would reveal any weaknesses immediately, plus his openness to contemporary music means he'd actually give it a fair chance.

Character 1 [en]: Think Burkart or Muramatsu would be interested in manufacturing?

Character 2 [en]: Burkart might actually, er, be perfect since they're, you know, already innovating with their Micro-Link mechanism, and, well, Lillian Burkart has always been, hmm, forward-thinking about advancing flute technology.
