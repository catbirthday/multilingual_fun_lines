Character 1 [en]: So, I've been researching anniversary flowers, and [bitter] apparently there's this whole language I never learned.

Character 2 [en]: Oh honey, you know, flower language is, um, basically this beautiful mess that nobody really agrees on anyway! Different cultures, different meanings, so, honestly, whatever feels right to you is what matters most.

Character 1 [en]: Yes, I've categorized them by meaning, color palette, and longevity.

Character 2 [en]: God, I love that you made categories! Most people just panic-buy whatever's in the front cooler, but you're treating this like the important mission it is.

Character 1 [en]: I calculated that fresh flowers lasting five to seven days would be optimal based on our schedule.

Character 2 [en]: Five to seven days is [gasp softly] actually perfect timing! Listen, anything longer and they start getting that funeral home vibe, you know what I mean?

Character 1 [en]: Between seventy-five and ninety-five dollars, including tax and delivery.

Character 2 [en]: Beautiful budget! That's the sweet spot where we can really play—get creative with texture, maybe throw in some unexpected elements that'll make her do that little happy dance.

Character 1 [en]: I have a spreadsheet [empathetically] tracking flowers she's commented on over the years.

Character 2 [en]: Stop it, that's the most romantic thing I've heard all week! A flower spreadsheet—you're literally documenting her joy, that's pure love right there.

Character 1 [en]: Purple lisianthus appears seventeen times, roses eleven times, peonies nine times but they're out of season.

Character 2 [en]: Seventeen times! Well, I mean, that woman knows what she wants, and lisianthus are, er, absolutely divine—they look like roses and peonies had a baby, so, basically, you're hitting all her favorites in one flower.

Character 1 [en]: What's the price [stuttering] dif-differential between standard and premium stems?

Character 2 [en]: Premium stems are about [stuttering] thir-thirty percent more, but baby, they're worth every penny—fuller heads, stronger stems, and they'll strut their stuff for the full week.

Character 1 [en]: She's allergic to lily pollen, um, so that entire family is, you know, completely off limits, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: No lilies, perfect—honestly, [regretful] I hate how they drop pollen everywhere anyway, stains everything yellow! We'll build something pollen-free that won't make her sneeze through your anniversary dinner.

Character 1 [en]: Eucalyptus has [quickly] antimicrobial properties, actually, that could, um, extend vase life by, well, twelve to eighteen percent.

Character 2 [en]: You beautiful nerd! Yes, eucalyptus is, [overly polite] basically, nature's preservative, and, honestly, it smells like a fancy spa, so, er, you're giving her flowers AND aromatherapy.

Character 1 [en]: Excellent. Can you provide care instructions in writing?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! I'll write you my personal cheat sheet—water temp, cutting angles, even which room gets the best light-to-temperature ratio for maximum flower happiness.
