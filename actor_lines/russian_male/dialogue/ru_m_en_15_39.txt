Character 1 [en]: I just converted all my preferred shares to common stock in the startup.

Character 2 [en]: Oh really, so you gave up, um, your liquidation preference? That's [jealous] quite the vote of confidence, but, you know, what made you think that was, actually, the smart move here?

Character 1 [en]: The board said it would align my interests better with other shareholders.

Character 2 [en]: The board told you that? Let me ask you something: did they explain what happens to your voting rights when the next funding round dilutes everyone's common stock by forty percent?

Character 1 [en]: Wait, they said dilution [speeding up] wouldn't be that bad since we're growing fast.

Character 2 [en]: Growing fast doesn't protect you from dilution. Quick question: do you know what anti-dilution provisions you had with your preferred shares that you just gave up?

Character 1 [en]: Anti-dilution provisions?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I mean, [empathetically] most preferred stock comes with, well, weighted-average anti-dilution protection that, basically, shields you from getting crushed when they raise at a lower valuation.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] But, um, they said common stock was, you know, simpler and that, er, employees prefer it.

Character 2 [en]: Employees get common stock because, hmm, they have no choice, but here's the thing, you actually had preferred shares which, honestly, are objectively better in almost every scenario.

Character 1 [en]: I thought, well, common stock meant I'd make more if, sort of, we hit it big since there's no, uh, participation cap.

Character 2 [en]: Did your preferred shares have a participation cap? Because most modern preferred stock is participating preferred, meaning you get both your preference AND participate pro-rata in the remaining proceeds.

Character 1 [en]: Nobody, actually, explained it that way, I guess, during the, um, conversion discussion.

Character 2 [en]: Of course they didn't explain it. Let me test your understanding: what happens if the company sells for less than the total amount raised from investors?

Character 1 [en]: Everyone gets paid proportionally?

Character 2 [en]: Wrong! The preferred shareholders, er, get paid first, [loudly] which you were until yesterday, and common stockholders, basically, get whatever scraps are left, if anything!

Character 1 [en]: [very loudly] So I essentially just moved myself, you know, to the back of the line when, um, it comes to getting paid out?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly! And here's another test: if the board, well, issues new shares to themselves as, uh, bonuses, whose ownership percentage gets diluted more, I mean, proportionally?

Character 1 [en]: Common stockholders get diluted more?

Character 2 [en]: Bingo! Common stockholders always, hmm, take the hit first, and honestly, by converting your preferred shares, you basically just volunteered to be, you know, first in line for every downside scenario.
