Character 1 [en]: So, I've been thinking, you know, I'm actually going to quit my job—already started, um, interviewing elsewhere.

Character 2 [en]: Oh wow, that's, err, [very meekly] really bold of you to, basically, take that step. Most people just complain about their jobs forever without actually doing anything about it, so that's impressive you're already making moves.

Character 1 [en]: Yeah, well, I figured, like, [pause] complaining without action is, you know, just wasting everyone's time.

Character 2 [en]: That's, um, a really healthy [deep pitch] mindset actually, though I guess, it must be scary too. Change always is, even when we're the ones choosing it and controlling the timeline.

Character 1 [en]: Not really scared, just focused. I've got three months of savings and five interviews lined up already.

Character 2 [en]: Five interviews already? That's incredibly organized. I remember when I was job hunting it took me weeks just to work up the courage to send out one application.

Character 1 [en]: I don't believe in waiting for courage. I just make spreadsheets and execute.

Character 2 [en]: That's such a practical approach. I tend to overthink everything until I'm paralyzed, but you seem to have figured out how to bypass all that emotional turbulence.

Character 1 [en]: Emotions are, uh, fine but they don't, [long pause] you know, pay rent. So I just, basically, compartmentalize and keep moving.

Character 2 [en]: Fair enough. Though sometimes I wonder if feeling things fully might actually help us make better long-term decisions, even if it slows us down in the moment.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe for some people, but, honestly, I've found that, er, momentum matters more than, well, perfect decisions.

Character 2 [en]: That's, hmm, probably true—I mean, I've definitely, sort of, watched myself lose opportunities while waiting for, uhh, absolute certainty that never comes.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly. So, anyway, I'm giving notice next week, regardless of whether, um, these interviews pan out, because, actually, I'd rather temp than stay.

Character 2 [en]: That's really [bitter] brave, I suppose, though I could never do that. The uncertainty would eat me alive, but you seem completely unbothered by the prospect of temporary work.

Character 1 [en]: Temporary work is still [yawn] work. Plus it gives me flexibility to be selective about what comes next.

Character 2 [en]: You're right, I guess, about that—like, having that, err, flexibility probably prevents you from, basically, jumping at the first offer out of desperation.

Character 1 [en]: Desperation is, well, basically a choice. I mean, I choose not to operate from that, you know, mindset.

Character 2 [en]: I really [very sincerely] admire how clear you are about all this. Most of us get so tangled up in fear and what-ifs that we forget we actually have agency in our own lives.

Character 1 [en]: Agency is all we have. Everything else is just noise.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, that's certainly [overly polite] one way to look at it, and, honestly, I wish I had even, like, half of your confidence about these things.
