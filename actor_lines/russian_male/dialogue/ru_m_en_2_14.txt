Character 1 [en]: This windmill is rigged. There's no way it spins that fast naturally.

Character 2 [en]: Oh come on, it's not rigged, you just, um, you mistimed it like four times in a row. Look, the secret is to hit it when the blade is at, uh, eleven o'clock, not twelve—gives you that extra millisecond of clearance.

Character 1 [en]: [gasp softly] You've been counting my attempts?

Character 2 [en]: Well yeah, I mean, it's hard not to when you're, like, aggressively muttering "stupid windmill" every single time. Plus you're holding up the family of seven behind us who are, mmm, starting to look pretty murderous honestly.

Character 1 [en]: I bet you can't make this shot either.

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, challenging me now? Alright alright, watch and learn—see, you gotta read the artificial turf grain, account for that, er, suspicious wet spot near the hole, and then just absolutely nail the timing.

Character 1 [en]: [sniffle] Did you just say "turf grain"?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah yeah, mock all you want, but mini golf is basically, like, physics meets psychology meets whoever designed this nightmare course while probably drunk. Speaking of which, why is there a, uh, giant octopus on hole twelve?

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Wait, you've played here before?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, three times actually—once for my nephew's birthday, once on the world's worst first date, and once when I was, um, hiding from my responsibilities and thought eighteen holes of pure chaos would help somehow.

Character 1 [en]: And you still came back with me?

Character 2 [en]: Sure sure, I'm a masochist apparently, plus you promised to buy the, uh, overpriced nachos afterward, which honestly taste way better when you're nursing your pride after losing to a mechanical windmill.

Character 1 [en]: I haven't lost yet. I've got nine more strokes.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, nine strokes on a par three—that's, wow, that's actually impressive in the worst way. Like, I think they give you a free snow cone if you hit double digits, sort of a, mmm, consolation prize situation.

Character 1 [en]: You're supposed to be supportive!

Character 2 [en]: Right right, sorry, um, here's me being supportive—you're doing amazing sweetie, that ball is definitely afraid of you now, and I'm sure the windmill will, uh, surrender any minute from sheer exhaustion.

Character 1 [en]: Now you're just being mean.

Character 2 [en]: [pause] Okay look, genuinely? You're overthinking it—just, like, tap it gently when you feel ready, don't calculate or aim too hard, sometimes these things work better when you're not trying to, er, assassinate the ball.

Character 1 [en]: Fine. One more try. If I miss, we're leaving.

Character 2 [en]: [sigh] Deal, but honestly, even if you miss, we're still doing the volcano hole because I need to see you argue with that, um, animatronic parrot that screams when you putt—it's basically the highlight of this whole ridiculous place.
