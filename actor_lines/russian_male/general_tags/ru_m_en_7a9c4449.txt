=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] They say you're, um, the most loyal of all his knights, that you've, [bitter], never once questioned an order even when, well, even when children were involved. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] I serve the realm and, um, its rightful lord, though I wonder, [curious], what a peasant like you could possibly understand about, [cold], the burdens of maintaining order when, I mean, chaos threatens everything.

Character 1 [en]: [restrained] Order—is that what you call it when, um, families starve while the lord's dogs, [accusatory], feast on meat that could feed a village for, well, for weeks, when children work themselves to, [breaking], death in his fields?

Character 2 [en]: You speak of hardships that have, um, always existed since the first kings ruled these lands, and yet you dare, [stern], suggest that your petty rebellion could somehow, well, improve anything. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] I've watched my sister die of, um, hunger while carrying sacks of grain to his storehouse, watched my father, [choked], whipped for keeping back a single loaf to feed, well, to feed his dying wife.

Character 2 [en]: The law is harsh but, [uncomfortable], necessary—without it there would be no kingdom, no protection from, [defensive], raiders and invaders who would take everything and leave, [trailing], nothing but ashes.

Character 1 [en]: [passionate] Protection? You protect us from, [sarcastic], imaginary enemies while the real monster sits on a throne, [fierce], bleeding us dry with taxes and laws that exist only to keep us, [spitting], beneath his boot.

Character 2 [en]: You think me blind to suffering but I've seen, [weary], war, child—I've seen what happens when order collapses and, [haunted], men become beasts.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Have you ever gone three days without food, watched your children's, [pained], bellies swell with hunger while you tell them stories to distract from the, [cracking], gnawing pain that never stops? [voice breaks]

Character 2 [en]: [hesitant] I was born to this armor, um, raised from birth to wield a sword in service, but I—well, I remember being young and, [uncertain], questioning things too.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Then you understand that sometimes the law itself becomes the, [intense], tyranny, that sometimes those who enforce it become the very, [accusatory], monsters they claim to fight. [pleading]

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] My oath binds me to serve, [struggling], regardless of my personal feelings about justice or mercy.

Character 1 [en]: Your oath binds you to protect the innocent, [firm], doesn't it, or have you forgotten that part while, [bitter], polishing your master's boots?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You know nothing of the oaths I've taken or, um, the weight they carry, nothing of what I've, well, sacrificed to maintain this fragile peace. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Then help us.

Character 2 [en]: I, um, can't. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [revealing] The resistance grows larger every day—nobles' sons and daughters who've seen too much, [hopeful], merchants tired of bleeding gold, even some of your fellow knights who remember what, [passionate], honor truly means whisper our name in the dark. [determined]

Character 2 [en]: [shaken] That's not possible—the lord's control is, [uncertain], absolute, his spies are everywhere watching, [nervous], listening to every word spoken in every tavern and, [trailing off], every home.

Character 1 [en]: His spies report what they're, well, told to report because half of them are, um, already ours. [confident]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] You're, um, lying—this is just, well, desperation talking.
