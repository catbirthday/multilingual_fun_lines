=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [reserved] So, um, I guess we're, [stiff], doing this professionally then, I mean, catering for your film crew on, [careful], the boat Dad left me, well, after everything that happened.

Character 2 [en]: [cautious] Um, yeah, I mean, the production needed an authentic yacht and yours is, [measured], perfect for the scene we're shooting, so, you know, here we are.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, it's been five years since, [pained], we've been in the same room, and now, like, you're transforming Dad's yacht into, [bitter], something for Hollywood, I mean, that's quite something.

Character 2 [en]: [professional] The art department will be careful with everything, [firm], respecting the original design while creating the atmosphere we need for the film.

Character 1 [en]: You always had a talent for, [wistful], making spaces tell stories, even when we were kids building, [softer], forts in the garage.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, that feels like, [distant], a lifetime ago, you know, before everything got complicated between us.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I mean, complicated is one way to describe you, [hurt], taking Mom's side without even hearing mine out, um, yeah.

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Well, you disappeared for three years chasing, [resigned], Michelin stars while she was dying, so, um, what was there to hear really?

Character 1 [en]: [broken] I know.

Character 2 [en]: But here's the thing that, [struggling], nobody talks about—she, [quieter], understood why you left, she told me, [heavy], before the end.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] She never said that to me when I, [voice breaking], finally came back for those last weeks at the hospice.

Character 2 [en]: She said you needed to, [gentle], become who you were meant to be, that keeping you here would have, [sad], killed something essential in you, and she couldn't, [trailing off], do that.

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] All these years I thought she died, [choked], hating me for choosing my career over, [anguished], being there when she needed me most.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Um, no, she was proud, like, really proud of what you accomplished, I mean, she kept every article about your restaurants.

Character 1 [en]: Why didn't you tell me this, um, before now, I mean, we could have, [regretful], avoided so much pain, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [honest] Because I was angry and, [admitting], grief makes you do stupid things like, [quieter], holding onto resentment like it's the only thing keeping you afloat.

Character 1 [en]: This yacht was supposed to be for all of us, [nostalgic], Dad's dream of sailing together as a, [wistful], family once we all made it.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] We all made it.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Well, maybe after your film wraps, um, we could, [tentative], take her out together, like, really sail her the way Dad imagined, [vulnerable], if you want to, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: I'd like that more than you, [emotional], know, cooking together in that galley again, well, like when we were young. [long pause]
