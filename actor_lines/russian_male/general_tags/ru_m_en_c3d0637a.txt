Scenario: An HVAC technician arrives for routine maintenance and discovers the elderly customer has been living without heat for weeks, too proud to ask for help she can't afford.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [concerned] Mrs. Chen, your thermostat is set to fifty degrees but it's, [gentle], reading sixty-eight in here, which means your furnace hasn't been running at all. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Oh, I've been meaning to call about that but the weather's been, [dismissive], mild enough that I barely noticed the difference really.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] The dust pattern shows it hasn't run for weeks, maybe months, and there's, [worried], extra blankets piled everywhere, even in your kitchen.

Character 2 [en]: [embarrassed] Well, um, you know how it is, I mean, sometimes these old bones just, [quieter], feel cold no matter what the temperature is, and uh, blankets are cheaper than, [trailing off], running the heat all day anyway. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [tender] Mrs. Chen.

Character 2 [en]: My daughter doesn't need to know about this because she'd, [firm], insist on paying and she's got her own family to, [breaking], worry about with the twins starting college next year and, [whispered], everything else.

Character 1 [en]: [understanding] Well, um, I know. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Please just tell me what needs replacing so I can, [resigned], figure out which bills to skip this month.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Um, actually Mrs. Chen, I mean, the thing is your furnace just needs, [carefully], a new ignitor which is, well, covered under the warranty you didn't know, [brightening], you still had.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] I haven't had a warranty for, well, years—I mean, my husband handled all that before he, [emotional], passed.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Well, um, I pulled up your account and, you know, Mr. Chen actually prepaid for, [steadying], our lifetime service plan back in 2018, which means, uh, everything including parts and labor is, [meaningfully], already taken care of.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] That sounds like, um, something Harold would do—he was always, well, you know, thinking ahead about things I might, [voice cracking], need when he was gone, even though I mean, we never really, [overwhelmed], talked about it directly.

Character 1 [en]: [compassionate] He also left detailed notes in our system about your preferred temperature settings and, [touched], which rooms you use most, almost like he wanted to make sure, [thick voice], you'd stay comfortable. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [crying softly] Sometimes I keep it cold on purpose because the shivers remind me I'm, [broken], still here, still feeling something besides the, [hollow], endless quiet of this empty house.

Character 1 [en]: [earnest] Well, you know, Mrs. Chen, I um, I lost my mom last year and er, the hardest part was learning that, [struggling], accepting help isn't giving up, it's what, well, keeps us connected to the people who, [emotional], loved us.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Your mother raised a good son who notices when old ladies are, [lighter], too stubborn to admit they need help.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Um, you know, I could also check your water heater while I'm here, and uh, maybe look at those drafty windows—it's all covered under what, [carefully], Mr. Chen arranged, so I mean, you'd actually be wasting his gift, [meaningfully], if you didn't let me fix everything.

Character 2 [en]: Harold always said the best technicians are the ones who, [fond], see the person not just the problem, and here you are, [touched], proving him right again just like he's still, [wistful], watching over me somehow. [soft laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [sincere] Thank you.

Character 2 [en]: [decided] Well then, young man, you better get started because Harold would, [playful], haunt us both if I let you leave without, [firm], fixing every single thing on his list, and knowing him, [affectionate], he probably left you a very long one.
