Scenario: An organizational consultant evaluating hospital programs discovers the music therapist they're assessing once saved their own child's life through the very program now facing elimination.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [professional] I appreciate you meeting with me today—the board wants a comprehensive evaluation of all, [measured], non-essential therapeutic programs before the next fiscal year.

Character 2 [en]: Non-essential is an interesting, [tense], choice of words for something that literally brings children back from, [quiet], the edge of giving up when medicine alone, [bitter], can't reach them anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [careful] Look, I understand this is, um, difficult, but we need to, [analytical], examine the actual measurable outcomes versus, well, the cost of maintaining these programs.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You want measurable outcomes, well, um, how about the fact that, [passionate], our music therapy sessions reduce pediatric ICU stays by an average of, like, three days, which saves the hospital more than, [intense], my entire department's salary, you know?

Character 1 [en]: The data you're citing is, umm, [skeptical], from five years ago and the board needs, [firm], current metrics that justify why we should keep this instead of, well, expanding our cognitive behavioral therapy team which has, [clinical], proven higher success rates, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: Success rates don't capture what happens when, um, [emotional], a child who hasn't spoken in weeks suddenly starts, well, humming along to a melody, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [uncomfortable] I realize there are, um, anecdotal successes, but, [struggling], my job is to make recommendations based on, like, hard data and fiscal responsibility, not, [conflicted], emotional appeals, I mean, however compelling they might be.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Six years ago, um, there was a little girl in the burn unit who, well, [voice breaking], wouldn't let anyone near her for weeks.

Character 1 [en]: I don't think personal stories are going to, [frustrated], change what the board has already, umm, basically decided, and honestly bringing up individual cases just, [impatient], makes this evaluation process harder for everyone, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [intense] That little girl only started her recovery when, um, [trembling], someone sat by her bed every day playing guitar until she felt safe enough to, well, let the doctors help her heal, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] These stories are touching, [hesitant], I'm not denying that, but touching doesn't translate to, [resigned], sustainable in our current budget climate.

Character 2 [en]: [broken] The thing is, um, that therapist was me, and, [shaking], that little girl who almost died in the burn unit was, well, my daughter Emma who's alive today because this, [fierce], supposedly non-essential program existed when we needed it, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Your daughter was—I mean, I didn't, [shocked], know that you had a personal connection to—

Character 2 [en]: [raw] Every child who comes through these doors has parents who are, um, [desperate], just as terrified as I was, and now you want me to look them in the eye and tell them that, well, [angry], spreadsheets matter more than their kids having a reason to keep fighting, like, is that really what you're asking me to do?

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] This changes things considerably—I mean, the board should, [conflicted], know about the personal investment you have in this program, which could be seen as, umm, a conflict of interest or, [uncertain], maybe it's exactly why you're the right person to run it, I don't, well, I honestly don't know anymore.

Character 2 [en]: My personal investment is that I've, um, [fierce], seen what happens when you reduce healing to numbers and ignore the fact that, well, [passionate], sometimes a song reaches places that medicine can't touch, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [determined] I'm going to recommend that we, [decisive], conduct a three-month pilot study documenting every single interaction and outcome before making, [committed], any cuts to your program.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Three months to prove that, um, what we do here can't be, [weary], quantified on a spreadsheet but shows up in the eyes of kids who, well, remember how to smile again. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: It's not ideal but it's the best I can, [earnest], offer given what the board expects from me, and maybe together we can find a way to, [hopeful], translate what you do into language they'll understand without, [thoughtful], losing what makes it work.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Fine, um, three months to somehow capture the unmeasurable, but just, [quiet], remember that behind every data point you collect there's a child like Emma was, you know?
