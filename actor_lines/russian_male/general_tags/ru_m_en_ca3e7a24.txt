=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [enthusiastic] Oh my goodness, um, I can't believe we're actually, [thrilled], sitting here discussing this because, well, your client's interest in our, [amazed], community center is just incredible, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [professional] My client has been following your work here for years and is, [impressed], particularly moved by your sliding scale program that makes arts accessible to everyone. [smiles]

Character 1 [en]: [excited] Well, I mean, we've been running this program for, [proud], twelve years now and, um, it's amazing to think someone of his stature even knows we exist. [laughs]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] He actually grew up in a similar neighborhood and remembers, [thoughtful], what it was like not being able to afford, [sincere], artistic training when he was young.

Character 1 [en]: [touched] That's exactly why we created this whole sliding scale system because talent, [passionate], shouldn't be limited by someone's bank account.

Character 2 [en]: [admiring] Your passion is exactly what convinced him that this is, [confident], the right place to establish his scholarship fund, [decisive], rather than at one of the bigger institutions. [nods]

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] I'm honestly getting emotional here because we've been, [voice-cracking], struggling so much lately with funding cuts and this could, [hopeful], change everything for our kids.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Well, um, he wants to ensure that, [careful], at least fifty students per year can attend completely free, and, uh, he's thinking about a ten-year commitment initially. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: Fifty students, um, that's more than, [stunned], we've ever been able to fully subsidize and, well, with ten years guaranteed, [breathless], we could actually plan long-term programs, you know. [gasps]

Character 2 [en]: Um, exactly, well, right.

Character 1 [en]: The impact this would have on our community is just, [emotional], beyond what I can even articulate because these kids, [teary], they have so much talent but no opportunities and this would, [voice-breaking], literally change their lives.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, absolutely. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] This is transformative.

Character 2 [en]: [businesslike] We'll need to work through the specifics of how students qualify and how the funds are, [methodical], distributed according to your existing sliding scale framework.

Character 1 [en]: Of course, we have all our income verification processes, [eager], already in place and our assessment criteria is, [animated], completely transparent so families know exactly how we, [enthusiastic], determine who gets what level of support.

Character 2 [en]: My client will want quarterly reports showing the demographics and progress of scholarship recipients to ensure the program is, [focused], reaching the intended communities. [firmly]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] We already track everything meticulously because accountability is, [earnest], so important to us and our other donors, plus seeing these kids' progress is honestly, [joyful], the best part of my job.

Character 2 [en]: [appreciative] Your dedication really shines through and I think that's what will make this partnership, [optimistic], so successful for everyone involved.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] Um, I just want to say that, [sincere], this means more than you know, and, well, we won't let your client down. [chokes-up]

Character 2 [en]: [moved] Well, I think, um, he already knows that, [confident], which is exactly why he chose your center over all the, [proud], other options, you know.
