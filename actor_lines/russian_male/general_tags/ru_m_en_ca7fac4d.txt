Scenario: An ambassador meets with the juvenile probation officer who handled her daughter's case five years ago, now that the daughter has been arrested again for vandalizing embassy property during an anti-war protest.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stiff] Officer Martinez, I was, [controlled], told you handled my daughter's case when she was, [bitter], thirteen and now she's been arrested again at, [exhausted], eighteen for spray-painting anti-war slogans on embassy walls.

Character 2 [en]: [recognizing] Ambassador Chen, yes I remember, [heavy], Sophia very well—she was angry then about, [careful], your divorce and the constant relocations, and honestly this new arrest feels like, [knowing], the same pain expressing itself differently. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I know what you're thinking, I mean, that I've been absent or, [struggling], disconnected from her life but, well, diplomatic service demands, [trailing off], certain sacrifices.

Character 2 [en]: The sacrifices aren't just, [pointed], yours though—Sophia told me back then about eating, [sad], dinner alone in five different countries before she turned, [measured], ten and how she learned to stop expecting you to show up.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, I mean, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] She's facing serious charges this time because embassy property is, [warning], federal jurisdiction and your diplomatic immunity doesn't, [harsh], extend to her anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] I've spent, um, twenty years negotiating peace treaties and, well, navigating international crises but I can't, [breaking], seem to reach my own daughter or, umm, understand why she keeps, [defeated], destroying everything I've worked to build. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Well, um, maybe that's exactly it—she's destroying what, I mean, took you away from her.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Every summit I attended was supposed to make the, [hollow], world safer for her.

Character 2 [en]: [direct] But she didn't need a safer world, Ambassador—she needed a, [emphatic], present parent.

Character 1 [en]: [cracking] God help me.

Character 2 [en]: [professional] Five years ago I recommended family therapy which you, [disappointed], declined due to scheduling conflicts, then suggested boarding school which, [frustrated], you chose instead, and now we're looking at potential, [grim], prison time for your daughter.

Character 1 [en]: You must think I'm a, [ashamed], terrible mother. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Well, um, I think you're a woman who, uh, believed serving her country meant, I mean, something noble.

Character 1 [en]: [raw] The irony is that I've spent my entire career preventing, [choking], conflicts between nations while my daughter has been waging, [anguished], war against me since she could talk. [cries]

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Um, well, er, actually.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] So, um, what do I do now, I mean, how do I fix this when she won't even, well, take my calls from juvenile detention?

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Um, you start by showing up, I mean, not as Ambassador Chen with, [pointed], diplomatic solutions but as her mother who's finally ready to, well, listen to what she's been screaming through all this, [weary], vandalism and rage.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] Then I'll resign my post effective immediately because some, [emotional], negotiations can't be conducted from across an ocean. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] That's the first thing you've said that might, [hopeful], actually reach her—just know that undoing eighteen years of, [cautious], absence will take more than one grand gesture. [pause]
