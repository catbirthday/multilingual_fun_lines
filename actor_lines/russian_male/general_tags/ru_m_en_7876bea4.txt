=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [formal] General Morrison, I've been sent here by the tribunal to, [careful], discuss the terms of your testimony and whether you might, [measured], consider a cooperation agreement.

Character 2 [en]: [weary] Well, um, I suppose you drew the short straw then, didn't you—sitting across from the, [bitter], monster who saved ten thousand lives by killing three hundred civilians. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [diplomatic] The committee recognizes the complexity of your situation, which is precisely why, [steady], I volunteered to come here myself rather than send an aide.

Character 2 [en]: [hollow laugh] Volunteered? That's either incredibly brave or incredibly naive—I'm genuinely, [curious], not sure which one applies to someone like you.

Character 1 [en]: Um, perhaps it's neither, General—maybe, well, it's just that I was there, [quiet], twenty years ago when you evacuated my family from the embassy compound in Sarajevo.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You were one of the—I mean, God, you were just a child then, um, weren't you, [remembering], hiding behind your mother's legs while the shells fell, [haunted], and now here you are in your pressed suit, [broken], representing the very court that's condemned me.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] Well, yes, I was seven years old, and um, you carried my sister on your shoulders for, [choked up], three miles through sniper fire when she couldn't walk anymore. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] That was before I became what I am now—before I made the choice that, [heavy], turned me from hero to villain in the world's eyes, [quieter], before I ordered the strike on that village to stop the massacre of, [cracking], fifty thousand refugees.

Character 1 [en]: The world sees a war criminal, but I see someone who made an impossible choice, [conflicted], and has been dying inside every day since then.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Um, don't—don't try to absolve me, delegate, because I know what I did and, [firm], I'd do it again if it meant saving those people. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, I'm not here to absolve you, General, but, um, I am here to tell you that, [earnest], your testimony could prevent future commanders from facing your choice, [passionate], and maybe that's worth something—maybe that's the only redemption, [softer], any of us really gets.

Character 2 [en]: Redemption—Christ, what a word to use here, I mean, um, do you think testifying will bring back those three hundred souls or, [anguished], give me a single night's sleep without seeing their faces?

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] No, but it might save the next three hundred, or three thousand, [urgent], when military doctrine changes based on what you share with us.

Character 2 [en]: [contemplating] You're asking me to relive the worst day of my life in excruciating detail, to, [vulnerable], dissect every second of that decision while the world watches, [trembling], to strip myself bare before people who've already judged me guilty, [defeated], and you think that's my path to peace? [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, I think peace is—is something you'll never find, but, [honest], purpose might still be within reach.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Purpose—God, when did you become so wise, that terrified little girl who, [wistful], wouldn't let go of my hand at the checkpoint, [emotional], now trying to save my damned soul while I rot in this cell, [whispered], thinking she owes me something when it's I who owe the world everything. [breaks]

Character 1 [en]: Um, we all owe—[voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] All right, delegate—no, what's your name, your real name, because if I'm going to, [struggling], do this thing you're asking, um, I need to know who I'm doing it for. [steadier]

Character 1 [en]: Sarah—my name is Sarah Mitchell, and that terrified little girl, [trembling], never forgot the man who whispered jokes to keep her calm while the world, [grateful], exploded around them, and yes, General Morrison, [firm], I suppose I am trying to save you.

Character 2 [en]: Then I'll testify, Sarah, not for redemption or, um, even for purpose, but because, [accepting], that seven-year-old girl grew up to believe there's still something, [moved], worth saving in me, and maybe—well, maybe that's, [surrendering], enough of a reason to try. [exhales slowly]
