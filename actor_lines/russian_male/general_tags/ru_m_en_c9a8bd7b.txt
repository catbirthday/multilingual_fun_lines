=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] So you're the philosopher I've been, [bitter], debating with about whether fictional worlds have, [trembling], genuine ontological status for the past, [voice breaking], six months online.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I didn't know it was you when we started, er, corresponding, and by the time I, well, realized, it was too late to, [awkward], just reveal myself without, [trailing off], causing this exact situation.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] You left when I was twelve to pursue your, [sarcastic], precious academic career and now you want to discuss whether, [mocking], Tolkien's Middle-earth exists in some metaphysical sense.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] The nature of existence isn't just, [dismissive], academic nonsense—it's fundamental to understanding how we, [philosophical], relate to stories and imagination itself. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [hurt] Those books you study were more real to me than you ever, [breaking], were after you walked out that door to chase, [bitter laugh], tenure at Oxford.

Character 2 [en]: [stubborn] My leaving had nothing to do with, [defensive], choosing philosophy over family—your mother made it impossible to stay. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: Don't you dare blame her when you're the one who, [furious], prioritized publishing papers about abstract being over, [shaking], actually being present for your own, [voice cracking], child's existence.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] You clearly inherited her talent for, [dismissive], reducing complex situations to simple moral failures without, [condescending], considering the philosophical implications of choice versus determinism.

Character 1 [en]: The philosophical implications don't matter when a child just needs their, [tearful], parent to show up for one birthday party. [cries softly]

Character 2 [en]: [uncomfortable] That's precisely why I continued our online discussions—to, [hesitant], connect with you through ideas since direct contact seemed impossible.

Character 1 [en]: [disbelief] You thought arguing about whether Harry Potter's world has, [incredulous], ontological weight would somehow make up for fifteen years of, [bitter], absence from my actual, non-fictional life?

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] At least through those debates I got to know, [regretful], the brilliant mind you've become despite everything.

Character 1 [en]: A mind shaped by fictional parents who actually, [pointed], stayed through their stories' endings.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Yes, I suppose so.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The irony is that you taught me more about existence through, [hollow], our anonymous arguments than you ever did as my actual father.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] I know. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: So what happens now—do we keep, um, pretending online that we're strangers debating whether, well, fictional relationships have metaphysical validity?

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Perhaps not.

Character 1 [en]: [weary] Well, I guess that's, um, something—though I'm not sure if it's progress or just another, err, philosophical problem for you to analyze from a distance.

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] No, um, this time I want to understand the, [emotional], real world consequences of my choices, not just their, er, abstract philosophical implications, even if it means confronting what I've, [breaking], actually lost. [voice cracks]
