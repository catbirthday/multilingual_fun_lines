Scenario: A plumber arrives to fix a polygraph examiner's home plumbing system, only to realize they're the same examiner who administered a test that cost the plumber a government contract years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stiffening] Well, this is interesting—you're the polygraph examiner from the federal building downtown, aren't you? The one who administered my test for the courthouse renovation contract. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Yes, I remember you. October 2019, if I recall correctly. Though I should clarify that I don't determine pass or fail—I simply record physiological responses and submit accurate data.

Character 1 [en]: [coldly professional] Right, just data. Well, your water main's leaking into the foundation, probably has been for months based on the erosion pattern I'm seeing down here.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] I understand this is awkward.

Character 1 [en]: [clipped] Awkward doesn't quite cover losing a two-million-dollar contract because someone's machine said my heartrate spiked when asked about my business partner's bankruptcy—which, by the way, happened fifteen years before we even met.

Character 2 [en]: [carefully neutral] The equipment doesn't lie, though interpretation can vary. But right now, I need to know if you can set aside whatever feelings you have and fix this leak professionally.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastically sweet] Oh, I'm nothing if not professional—wouldn't want anyone to think I'm the type to hold grudges or, [exhales], let personal feelings affect my work quality.

Character 2 [en]: Good. Because the water damage is spreading to my home office where I keep sensitive testing equipment worth more than most people's cars.

Character 1 [en]: [pointedly] Sensitive equipment, sure. You'll need to shut off the main valve for at least six hours while I replace this entire section of pipe—hope that won't interfere with any important work.

Character 2 [en]: [matter-of-fact] I work from the federal building, not here. Though I am curious—you seem to be suggesting I deliberately failed you, which would be a serious ethical violation. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: I'm not suggesting anything except that your pipes are corroded from the inside out, probably from the pH imbalance in your water supply that's been eating away at them for years.

Character 2 [en]: Interesting how damage can hide beneath the surface for so long before becoming visible—much like deception, actually, though I suppose you'd know more about pipes than psychology.

Character 1 [en]: [through gritted teeth] The thing about pipes is they're honest—when they're broken, you can see it, fix it, move on. Not like having your entire reputation questioned because a machine didn't like your galvanic skin response.

Character 2 [en]: [clinically precise] Your galvanic skin response was within normal ranges, actually. It was the cardiovascular patterns during the financial disclosure section that raised flags—but those records are sealed, so I shouldn't even be discussing this. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [suddenly curious] Wait, you remember my specific readings from four years ago? Out of what, hundreds of tests you must have administered since then?

Character 2 [en]: I remember every test where the subject later filed a formal complaint questioning my competence and suggesting I was, quote, 'a soulless bureaucrat who destroys lives with pseudoscience.'

Character 1 [en]: Well, the complaint obviously didn't stick since you're still working, still living in this nice house that needs eight thousand dollars of plumbing work, minimum.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly firm] The complaint didn't stick because I followed every protocol exactly. And yes, I can afford the repairs—my accuracy rate keeps me well employed, despite what failed applicants might prefer to believe.

Character 1 [en]: Your accuracy rate. Right. Look, I'll fix your pipes because that's my job, and unlike some professions, when I say something's fixed, it actually is. [standing up]

Character 2 [en]: [unexpectedly soft] For what it's worth, I recommended retesting in my report. The committee overruled it. I thought you should know that, even though I probably shouldn't be telling you.
