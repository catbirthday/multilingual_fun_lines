=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look I'm just—wait no—I need to ask about bundling. My dad's medical bills are killing us.

Customer Support: Oh wow. Okay. Let me... I'm going to pull up everything right now. Your account number is AC-4492-BN7 and I can see you've been with us since... oh you're one of our longtime customers. April 2019.

Customer: Right. Internet and phone. Need to add cable. Cut costs somehow.

Customer Support: I totally get it. Financial pressure is... it's real. So looking at your current billing—you're at $127.49 monthly for those two services—I think I can probably find you something that'll help. Let me just.

Customer: Thing is—no wait—dad's home all day now. Chemo Tuesdays Thursdays. Needs the distraction.

Customer Support: That's really tough. I'm so sorry your family's going through that. You know what? I'm seeing a promotion here that's not supposed to start until 01/15/2025 but I think... yeah I can probably apply it early. Triple bundle for $89.99 monthly.

Customer: Eighty nine? That's less than—how's that even—wait really?

Customer Support: It's kind of our best kept secret honestly. The system code is BUNDLE-SAVE-45 and it locks you in for 24 months at that rate. No increases. And here's the thing—I'm also seeing you qualify for our hardship program?

Customer: Didn't know that existed. God we're drowning here. His treatments are forty thousand already.

Customer Support: Jesus that's... okay. Right. So with the hardship discount—case number HC-2024-9847—we could probably drop it to $76.50 monthly. All three services.

Customer: I just—wait actually—that saves us like seven hundred a year? Eight hundred?

Customer Support: Let me calculate... it's $816 annual savings from your current bills. Installation would be 12/28/2024 and the tech window is... I can get you the 8am-10am slot? First appointment of the day. Super reliable.

Customer: Yes. Please. Can't thank you enough. Been so stressed. Mom's crying every night about money.

Customer Support: Hey you don't need to thank me. This is literally why I love this job. Being able to actually help people when they need it. Your confirmation is CNF-7739-XLP2 and I'm going to... I'm also waiving the $49.99 installation fee.

Customer: Um. You sure that's allowed?

Customer Support: I mean technically? Probably sort of a gray area but. You know what. Your family's dealing with enough. My supervisor code override is MGR-OVERRIDE-226 and I just applied it so. We're good.

Customer: Haven't had anyone be this nice in—sorry getting emotional—it's been a rough year.

Customer Support: Don't apologize. Seriously. I wish I could do more. Actually wait—let me check something else. So your first bill on 01/03/2025 will show the adjusted rate and... oh I can add three months of premium channels free too. Code PREMIUM-Q1-2025.

Customer: Stop you're gonna make me—I'm actually crying now—this helps more than you know.

Customer Support: Look I've got your number here—714-555-8823—and I'm going to personally follow up next week. Make sure everything's perfect. And honestly? If you need anything. Even just to vent about medical bills or whatever. You call back and ask for David. Extension 4429. I'm here Monday through Friday.
