=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi. So basically I'm trying to pick a plan for my mom's—er, she needs the service but I can't tell what's what.

Customer Support: Hi there, thanks for calling. Let me—actually no wait—let me pull up our pricing guide first. What's the account number or—or do you have a reference ID?

Customer: No ID yet. She's sick. Cancer. So I need the... what's the word... the premium one? But there's three premiums?

Customer Support: Oh gosh, I'm—I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah our tiers are, hmm, honestly confusing. Even I think—I think they could be clearer. So we've got Premium at $89, Premium Plus at $127, and then Premium Elite EPL-9000 at $199.

Customer: Wait. Uh. Okay but like what's actually different? She needs 24-hour access.

Customer Support: Right right. So the thing is—er, let me check—all three have 24-hour technically. But Premium, the basic one, code PREM-STD-89, only covers phone support overnight. The others have chat and video too.

Customer: Video? Um, for what? She can barely work her phone.

Customer Support: Yeah no I—I get it. Honestly? Most people don't use it. What's her main need? Like what's the... the core thing she needs help with?

Customer: Medication reminders. Er, scheduling. Transport to chemo. The basics.

Customer Support: Okay okay. So here's what I'd—hmm, actually wait. Transport coordination starts at Plus level, service code PLU-MED-127. But I wish I could just—look, the basic won't cover transport scheduling.

Customer: So basically hundred twenty seven minimum? That's... God. On top of everything else right now.

Customer Support: I know. I know, it's—it's a lot. Let me see if there's... erm, we have a compassionate care discount CCD-2024-Q4. Takes thirty percent off for medical hardship cases.

Customer: Really? Oh. Um. Wow okay so that would be like what, ninety?

Customer Support: Eighty-eight ninety. So actually—actually less than basic Premium. But there's paperwork. You'd need diagnosis verification form DVF-7A and, uh, income docs.

Customer: Papers. Great. More papers. Er, how fast? She needs this Monday.

Customer Support: Monday's... hmm. That's tight. What if—no wait—I can do provisional activation. Code PROV-TEMP-72HR gives three days while paperwork processes.

Customer: You can do that? Oh thank God. Yes. Please.

Customer Support: Absolutely. Let me—let me just get some basics. Full name? And, erm, actually I need the service address first for system setup.

Customer: Sarah Mills. Um. 4782 Oak. Apartment 3B.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect. Setting up account MLS-4782-3B now. And hey, I'm—I'm really sorry about what you're going through. The provisional starts immediately once I hit submit here.
