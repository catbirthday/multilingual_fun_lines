Though wait, let me check something first... hmm, you do have a bundle discount BND-7745-XK on StreamMax that might change if we remove MovieHub."

With this promo I can add, order modification OM-5563-RVP, you'd pay roughly $18 total for both services through February 2025, then it goes back to regular price."

You'll see the adjusted amount on your next billing cycle, and er, the ShowTime refund should hit your card in 3-5 business days. Anything else I can help clarify about these subscriptions?"
