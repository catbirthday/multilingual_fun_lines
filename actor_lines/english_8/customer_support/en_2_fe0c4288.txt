=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Of course the data's not working. Um, I have a shift in an hour.

Customer Support: Oh gosh, okay, let me pull up your account right away. What's your number?

Customer: It's 415-827-3044. This always happens when I actually need it.

Customer Support: Alright, I've got your account here, number 3044, and I can see—hmm, that's odd. Your plan shows active but there's a, sort of, suspension flag from yesterday at 11:47 PM.

Customer: Great. Just great. What's that even mean?

Customer Support: [exhale] So it looks like there was an automatic payment issue. But here's the thing—I think I can fix this really quickly. Your balance shows $127.43 due, but I'm seeing a payment that just... didn't process right.

Customer: Er, wait, I paid that yesterday. It's like... what do you call it... autopay?

Customer Support: Right, exactly! I see it now—transaction ID AP-9847-YZ attempted at 11:45 PM. The system probably flagged it because, well, sometimes our billing cycles get a bit confused when payments hit right at midnight.

Customer: So can you fix it or not? I literally have forty-five minutes.

Customer Support: [sharp inhale] Yes. Yes, I can absolutely fix this. Let me just—okay, I'm pushing through a manual override on code MAN-2847-OVERRIDE, and it should probably take, maybe, two minutes max to restore everything.

Customer: Two minutes? Um... really? That's actually possible?

Customer Support: *soft exhale* I know, I know it sounds too good to be true, but I'm already seeing the restore process at 47% on my screen. Your data package DT-UNLIMITED-5G should be back before we even finish talking.

Customer: Oh. Uh, wow, okay. I was expecting to be transferred three times.

Customer Support: Mmm, nope! Not today. Actually—oh perfect, I'm seeing green lights across your account now. Status code ACTIVE-FULL as of 9:14 AM. Can you maybe try loading something real quick?

Customer: Hold on, let me... oh my God it's working. It's actually working!

Customer Support: *relieved exhale* Good! That's really good. I've also added a credit of $15.00 to your account, reference number CR-6829-AM, just for the inconvenience.

Customer: Wait, seriously? You're giving me a credit too?

Customer Support: Of course! This shouldn't have happened. Your next bill on February 15th will show that adjustment. Is there, um, anything else I can help with before your shift?

Customer: No, I just—thank you. Really. This is... er... not how these calls usually go.

Customer Support: *soft laugh* I get that a lot, honestly. You have a good shift, okay? And your case number is 7742-MNK if you need to reference this. Take care!
