=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So so basically I'm—I'm calling because your system? It's it's holding my money hostage. Two weeks!

Customer Support: Oh no. That's. Um. That's definitely not right. Let me pull up your account... okay I see you're registered as LLC-4829-RETAIL and there's a hold placed on October 3rd for $8,427. I'm going to get this sorted for you right away because two weeks is... that's way too long.

Customer: Right? Like like I have bills! Suppliers! Can't can't just freeze everything!

Customer Support: Absolutely. I completely understand. So what I'm seeing here is... hmm... your account got flagged for review type R-772. But here's the thing. That should've cleared in 48 hours maximum. Not two weeks. This is... let me check something else real quick...

Customer: Oh great. Flagged. For for what? Existing? Making money?

Customer Support: No no, you're right to be frustrated. Okay so. What happened is. Er. Someone marked this as high-risk category MCC-5999 but that's... that's completely wrong for your business type. I'm going to. Actually. Let me fix this right now and make sure it never happens again...

Customer: High risk? I sell—I sell candles! Handmade candles! So dangerous right?

Customer Support: Candles. Right. That's... yeah that's definitely not high-risk. Someone really messed up here. I'm removing that flag immediately and... actually I'm also adding exemption code EX-VERIFIED-2024 to your account so this can't... I mean, this won't ever happen again.

Customer: Okay okay but but when do I actually get my money though?

Customer Support: Right. The important part. So. Once I submit this override... which I'm doing... now... funds should release within 2-4 hours. But. Hmm. Given what you've been through? I'm also escalating to priority release P-1. That means 30 minutes. Maximum.

Customer: Thirty minutes. Sure sure. Like like the forty-eight hours that became two weeks?

Customer Support: I hear you. I really do. Tell you what. I'm giving you my direct extension—it's 4-8-8-2-7. If those funds aren't in your account by... let's see it's 2:47 now... if they're not there by 3:30, you call me directly. And I'll. Well. I'll personally walk this to our finance team if I have to.

Customer: Wait wait you're—you're actually helping? Not just reading scripts?

Customer Support: Scripts don't fix problems like this. Look. What happened to you was... it was completely unacceptable. Your case number is CS-9982-PRIORITY and I'm... actually I'm also applying a service credit of $250 to your account for the inconvenience. Because two weeks without access to your own money? That could've... I mean that could really hurt a small business...

Customer: It it DID hurt! Lost two bulk orders! Couldn't couldn't buy supplies!

Customer Support: Oh that's... that's even worse than I thought. Okay. Let me. Uh. Let me see what else... you know what? I'm increasing that credit to $500. Credit ID CRD-500-1023. And I'm also... hold on... adding you to our Premier Protection program at no charge. That gives you a dedicated account manager so if anything weird happens...

Customer: Dedicated like like actually dedicated? Or "dedicated"?

Customer Support: Actually dedicated. Her name's Maria Chen. Extension 5-0-0-9. She handles maybe... fifteen accounts total? Not hundreds. And she'll be reaching out within 24 hours to make sure everything's... to make sure you're completely set up and protected going forward.

Customer: Okay. Okay okay. This is—this is better. Actually helping.

Customer Support: That's the goal. Always. So just to confirm everything... funds releasing by 3:30, case CS-9982-PRIORITY if you need to reference it, my extension 4-8-8-2-7 if there's any delay, and Maria at 5-0-0-9 will call you tomorrow. Did I... did I miss anything you need?
