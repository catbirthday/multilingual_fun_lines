=== Dialogue ===

Customer: [sharp inhale] Someone got into my account again and I just—I just can't do this anymore, how do I stop this?

Customer Support: Right. Okay. Let me see here... I'm pulling up your account AZ-9481-KLP and I can see three unauthorized login attempts from IP address 192.168.44.7 in the past week, which is definitely concerning.

Customer: Three? THREE? Oh god I only knew about one—wait wait wait, what else did they do?

Customer Support: Nothing else. They tried but didn't get in. Your current password stopped them, but we need to add security code 2FA-ENABLE to prevent future attempts—that's two-factor authentication.

Customer: I don't—*exhales*—I don't understand why this keeps happening to me, it's it's like they're targeting me specifically.

Customer Support: Hmm, looking at your security log... you're using password strength level 2 out of 5. We need minimum level 4, which means at least 12 characters with special symbols.

Customer: Twelve? But I can barely remember the one I have now.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: *sigh* Sorry I'm just... exhausted. What's the... what's the word... the easiest way to fix this?

Customer Support: No need to apologize. Let me see here... simplest solution is our security package SKU-8847-SEC at $4.99 monthly—includes password manager, automatic 2FA setup, and breach monitoring.

Customer: Another subscription? I can't—I can't afford more things right now.

Customer Support: Understood. Free option then. Download authenticator app code GAUTH-FREE, link it with verification code VRF-2891-XKQ, takes five minutes total.

Customer: Five minutes. Okay. Okay okay okay. And that'll stop them?

Customer Support: It will. Success rate is 99.7% prevention. Once activated with code VRF-2891-XKQ, unauthorized access drops to nearly zero—you'll sleep better knowing that.

Customer: *exhales* God I hope so. I'm just... done with this.

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: Can you just... walk me through it? Really slowly?

Customer Support: Of course. First step, grab your phone. Go to app store, search exactly G-A-U-T-H, that's Google Authenticator, completely free, file size only 24.8 MB.

Customer: Downloaded. Now what?

Customer Support: Perfect. Click add account. Choose scan barcode. Now on your computer, go to settings slash security slash enable-2FA—you'll see QR code REF-8923 there to scan.
