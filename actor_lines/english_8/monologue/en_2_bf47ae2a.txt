Subject: Learning your sister-in-law has been lying about her addiction relapse for six months

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Six months. She's been using for six months? [pause] I just—I can't even process this right now. We threw her that party, the celebration dinner for her one year clean and she was... oh my God, she was already using again. [upset] All those times she came over, playing with the kids, and I thought—I mean, we all thought she was doing so well. [bitter] And Jake, he's been covering for her this whole time? [pause] That's what gets me, you know? The lying. Not just from her but from him too. It's like, um... we've been living in this completely fake reality. [sad] I keep thinking about Thanksgiving when she seemed off and I asked if she was okay and she looked me right in the eyes and said she'd never been better. [shaky voice] How do you—how do you even help someone who won't let you? Who lies straight to your face? [crying while speaking] We could've helped her. That's what kills me. Instead of, I don't know, judging or being disappointed, we could've actually helped. [sniffle] But she chose to lie. For six months. And now I'm sitting here wondering... hmm, what else has been a lie?
