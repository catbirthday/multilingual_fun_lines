Subject: Getting promoted to instructor after your beloved mentor dies unexpectedly

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] They offered me her position today. The department chair just... called me in and said I'd be taking over all of Sarah's classes. [pause] I mean, it's what I've been working toward for years, right? Getting to teach, becoming an instructor, but not—not like this. Never like this. [sniffle] 

God, she was just here last week going over lesson plans with me. We were, um... we were laughing about how she always color-coded everything and I kept teasing her about her rainbow of sticky notes. And now I'm supposed to just... what, sit at her desk? Use her office? [upset] It feels so wrong. 

The thing is, I don't even know if I'm ready. Sarah always said—she'd say "you've got this," but that was with her here to, you know, catch me if I messed up. [very sad] Who's gonna tell me when I'm overthinking a lecture? Or when I need to, um, lighten up on the grading? 

[whispering] I keep thinking maybe I should say no. Like maybe someone else deserves it more, someone who's been here longer or... I don't know. [regretful] But then I hear her voice in my head saying don't be ridiculous, that she trained me for exactly this. [pause] I just wish she was here to see it happen.
