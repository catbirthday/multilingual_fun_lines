[pause] I actually had to excuse myself to the bathroom because I was about to lose it. [laugh] Four point two million guaranteed, and that's just year one. [very excited] Marcus has no idea—well, he knows the numbers but he doesn't know what I know. [slowly] His mom's been working three jobs since his dad passed. [emotional] Three jobs, and she still couldn't afford his little sister's medical bills. \n\n[clearing throat] Sorry, I just... hmm, when you see what these kids come from, you know? [warm] Marcus called me crying when we first met. [whispering] Said he'd sign anything just to help his family. [passionately] And I told him—no, we don't sign anything. [confidently] We get what you're worth. [pause] The team tried to lowball us at first, obviously. [frustrated] Two million, they said. [laugh loudly] I actually laughed in their faces.\n\n[very slowly] But when I showed them the analytics, the comparable contracts... [speeding up] and then Marcus's combine numbers, his college stats, the projection models—they knew. [triumphant] They knew they couldn't play games with us. [very sincerely] His mom can quit all three jobs tomorrow. [crying while speaking] His sister gets the surgery she needs. [shaky voice] And Marcus... that kid's gonna change the entire league, I swear to God."
