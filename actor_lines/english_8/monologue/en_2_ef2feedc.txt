=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Wait, what? [pause] No, that's not—you're saying months? [shaky voice] Not just like a one-time thing but actual months? [gasp] Oh my god. [very quietly] I think I'm gonna be sick. All those times they said they were working late, that was... [bitter] Of course it was. [laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. [pause] Who is it? Actually, wait—do I even want to know? [upset] Yeah, I do. Tell me everything. [anxious] How long have you known? Were other people—oh god, does everyone know? [crying while speaking] Have I just been walking around like some pathetic joke while everyone else knew? [furious] I can't believe this is happening. Three years, three fucking years and they just... [sigh] How do you even do that to someone? I mean, I trusted them with, er... with everything. [very sad] We were talking about moving in together next month. [laugh bitterly] That's hilarious now, isn't it? [pause] Thank you for telling me. [shaky voice] I know this couldn't have been easy for you either. I just, hmm, I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. [exhausted] Do I go home? Do I confront them? [very quietly] I don't think I can face them right now. [sniffle] Everything feels broken.
