=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [quietly] I just found the photo. [pause] The one from his tenth birthday, before Mom married his dad. [very sad] He's blowing out candles alone and... oh God, I get it now. [gasp softly] When we moved in, I basically— [shaky voice] I took over everything, didn't I? His room became "our" room. [regretful] His dad became, um... became the dad who came to my soccer games instead. [sniffle] Every Christmas after that was about making me feel included, and he just... [trailing off] I mean, I never even noticed how he'd, like, disappear during family dinners. [upset] Always said he wasn't hungry but— [pause] Jesus, he was hungry. He just couldn't sit there watching his dad, uh, basically choose me. [very quietly] The golden child who showed up and made him invisible. [bitter] And now he's loading boxes into that U-Haul and I want to say something but what? "Hey, sorry I, er... sorry I stole your life?" [frustrated] Twenty years too late to figure out why he never— [voice breaking] why he could never look me in the eye. [long pause] Seattle's far enough, I guess. [very sad] Far enough to finally be the only son again.
