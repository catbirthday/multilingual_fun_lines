Subject: Your dependent relationship with your family ending because you finally got clean, but losing the only support system you've known

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] I keep waiting for them to call, you know? But they don't. [pause] It's been three months clean and I thought—I mean, I really thought they'd be happy. [bitter] But here's the thing nobody tells you about getting sober. When you're using, when you're this mess that needs constant saving, they're always there. [sigh] Mom would text every morning, Dad would, um... he'd drive by to check on me. [sad] My sister would bring groceries, sit with me through the worst of it. They had this whole routine built around my crisis. [slowly] And now that I'm okay, now that I don't need rescuing anymore, it's like... where did everybody go? [anxious] I went to dinner last week and it was just silent. Nobody knew what to talk about. [laugh] We used to spend hours discussing my recovery plans, my relapses, my therapists. [trailing off] That was our whole relationship... [very sad] I didn't realize, hmm, how much of their identity was wrapped up in being my saviors. [shaky voice] And I guess, well, how much of mine was wrapped up in needing them. [long pause] So here I am, healthier than I've been in years, and I've never felt more alone. [quietly] Maybe this is what growing up actually feels like.
