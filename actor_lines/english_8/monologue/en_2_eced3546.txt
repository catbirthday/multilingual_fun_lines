Subject: Your die cutter operator precision saves the company right after they announce massive layoffs

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] Twenty-three years I've been running that die cutter. Twenty-three. And yesterday they're telling us half the floor's getting axed by Friday. [bitter] Today I catch that tolerance issue on the pharmaceutical packaging—point zero zero three millimeters off, nobody else saw it. Would've been, what, two million units recalled? [pause] Maybe more. [shaky voice] And now suddenly I'm employee of the month material. 

The CFO actually knew my name today. [sarcastic] Amazing what saving four million dollars does for your visibility, right? [sigh] 

I keep thinking about Rodriguez and Chen—they got their notices yesterday. Good people. Really good people. [quietly] And here I am getting handshakes from executives who couldn't pick me out of a lineup last week. 

You know what the plant manager said? [mocking] "This is why we need experienced operators." Like, um... like that wasn't obvious before they decided to gut the department? [frustrated] I'm supposed to feel grateful, I guess. And I am, I mean, I still have my mortgage to pay. But it's... [trailing off]

[very quietly] They're taking me out to lunch tomorrow. The whole leadership team. [pause] Twenty-three years, and all it took was almost shipping defective heart medication. [relieved] At least I still have a job. That's something.
