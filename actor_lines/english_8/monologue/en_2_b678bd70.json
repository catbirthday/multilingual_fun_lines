I honestly can't even process this right now. [sniffle] You know, all those doubles I pulled, all those weekends I missed your games, I just—I always felt so guilty about it, you know? Like I was, um... like I was failing you somehow. [crying while speaking] But you understood. You actually understood the whole time. And instead of being angry, you did this? [laugh] Look at me, I'm a complete mess. Your dad's crying at the dinner table. [warm] I kept telling myself it would all be worth it someday, that the sacrifices would, erhm... would mean something. But I never imagined this. You kids, saving your allowances and your part-time job money for us to finally have that trip we always talked about? [extremely happy] That beach house we drove past that one time? We're actually going? [delighted] This is the best surprise I've ever—come here, all of you. Come here right now."
