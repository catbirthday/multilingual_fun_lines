[nervous] The quiet kid who sat in the back corner, always scribbling in that beat-up notebook. [chuckle] God, I was such a mess back then. [very sincerely] But I needed to reach out because... honestly, your class saved me. [pause] I mean that literally. \n\n[quietly] I was going through some really dark stuff that semester—my parents' divorce, struggling with, um... with depression. [emotional] Writing was the only thing keeping me together, and then you said something I'll never forget. [clearing throat] You told me my voice mattered. [very slowly] That my stories deserved to exist. \n\n[sniffle] Nobody had ever said that to me before. [excited] And now? I'm actually a published author! [laughing] Can you believe it? [extremely happy] My debut novel comes out next month, and I just... I keep thinking about how close I came to giving up. [empathetically] If you hadn't pushed me to apply for that workshop, if you hadn't stayed after class all those times to talk through my stories... [trailing off] I don't know where I'd be. \n\n[very sincerely] So thank you. [warm] For seeing something in me when I couldn't see it myself."
