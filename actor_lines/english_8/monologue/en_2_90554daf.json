[sigh] The money finally came through—all of it, every last penny from those years of... well, doing what I had to do. [defensive] And you know what? I'm not apologizing for it anymore. [frustrated] Mom won't even answer my calls. [pause] Three months now. [very sad] Dad told me I'm dead to him. [laugh] Dead to him! [bitter] Like I'm the first person in this family who ever bent the rules. [quietly] But I guess, um... I guess I bent them too far this time. [regretful] The thing is, I keep thinking about Sunday dinners, you know? [sad] How we'd all sit around arguing about nothing, laughing about everything. [pause] Now I eat takeout in a penthouse. [sarcastic] Living the dream, right? [shaky voice] I tried sending them money—thought maybe that would, I don't know, prove something? [angry] They sent it back. [long pause] Every penny. [very quietly] Sometimes I wonder if... if they're right about me. [exhausted] Maybe some prices are just too high."
