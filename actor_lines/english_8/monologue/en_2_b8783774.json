[anxious] But no, it says right there—nationwide implementation. Every single processing plant. [long pause] Three years ago I was just, you know, trying to fix our one facility's injury rates. [warm] And Sarah kept saying \"this could be bigger\" but I thought she was just being... I don't know, supportive? [excited] But the numbers don't lie—we cut injuries by seventy percent! [quickly] Seventy! And now they want to roll it out to, what, thirty thousand workers? [overwhelmed] Oh god. [nervous laugh] That's so many people depending on something I created in my, um... in my spare time basically. [proud] I mean, I knew it was good. [hesitantly] The multilingual modules, the peer mentoring system—it all just made sense, you know? [emotional] But seeing corporate actually listen to someone on the floor for once? [chuckle] That never happens. [very sincerely] This could actually save lives. Real people won't get hurt because of something I built. [pause] Wow. [whispered] I think I need to sit down."
