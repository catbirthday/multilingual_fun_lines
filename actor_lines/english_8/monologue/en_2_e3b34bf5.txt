=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] I saved three people last week. Three. [bitter] And I keep thinking about how I couldn't save him. [pause] Like, here I am with my Narcan kit, running trainings, telling people the signs to look for, and I... I missed every single one with Danny. [shaky voice] Or maybe I didn't miss them, maybe I just—I don't know, refused to see them? [frustrated] God, he was so good at hiding it. [sad] Better than any of the people I work with now. [pause] They come to the clinic and they're, um, they're honest about where they're at, you know? [crying while speaking] Danny never gave me that chance. [angry] Never let me be his sister who does this for a living, who could've actually helped. [sigh] Just kept saying he was fine, he had it under control. [very quietly] And I believed him because, I mean, what else could I do? [passionately] So yeah, I keep showing up, keep doing the work, because maybe... maybe someone else's Danny will actually let them help. [sniffle] Maybe their story doesn't have to end like ours did. [very sad] Three people last week. [pause] But never the one who mattered most.
