Subject: The funeral director apprenticeship you thought you'd lost getting offered to you again after someone saw your volunteer work

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] They called me back. The funeral home, they— they actually called me back. I can't believe this is happening. [very quietly] I thought that door was completely closed, you know? After that interview went so badly, I just... I wrote it off. Figured I'd blown my one shot at getting into the profession. [laugh] But apparently Mr. Hendricks saw me at the hospice last week, helping with the memorial service arrangements, and he told the director about it. [extremely happy] He said I showed more compassion in that one afternoon than most people do in their whole careers! Can you believe that? Me, who completely froze when they asked about embalming procedures. [pause] I mean, I've been volunteering there for, um... almost six months now, just because I needed to do something, anything, to stay connected to this work. [very sincerely] It's where I'm supposed to be, I know that sounds weird but it's true. Death work isn't creepy or morbid, it's— it's sacred. [excited] And now I get to actually learn it properly! The apprenticeship starts next Monday. [shaky voice] God, I'm actually shaking. This is really happening. They saw who I really am, not just who I was in that terrible interview. [relieved] Second chances, man. Sometimes they actually happen.
