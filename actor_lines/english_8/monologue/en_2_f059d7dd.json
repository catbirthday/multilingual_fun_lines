[clearing throat] Remember last year when I was—when everything was falling apart with Mark? [sad] I was such a mess. I couldn't focus at work, I was snapping at everyone. [sigh] But you never once made me feel bad about it. [warm] You just... listened. Every time I needed to vent, you were there. [very sincerely] And when I couldn't stop talking about lawyers and custody schedules, you never rolled your eyes or told me to get over it. [pause] That meant more than you know. [empathetically] You said something once—I don't even think you remember—about how grief isn't linear. [slowly] That it's okay to have good days and then suddenly feel like you're drowning again. [relieved] That helped me stop beating myself up about, um... about not being \"over it\" fast enough. [happy] I'm doing so much better now. The kids are adjusting, I've got my own place, and I actually feel like myself again. [very quietly] But I don't think I would've made it through without your patience. [grateful] So thank you. Really. [chuckle] Sorry for getting all emotional on you during lunch."
