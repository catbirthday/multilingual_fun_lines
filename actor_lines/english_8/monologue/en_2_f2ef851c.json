[pause] God, I wanted to call someone immediately, you know? Share the news. And I'm scrolling through my phone and it's like... [confused] who do I even call? [bitter] Marcus? Haven't talked to him since I reported his team for missing deadlines. Sarah? [regretful] Oh right, she stopped returning my texts after I got her transferred. [long pause] When did this happen? I used to have, um... I had people. Real friends, not just these work acquaintances who smile at me because, well, they have to now. [sad] Remember game nights? Those stupid trivia nights at O'Malley's? [sigh] I kept saying I was too busy, had to prep for the quarterly reviews, had to... had to climb. And they stopped asking. [very melancholic] Regional Director. Corner office. Six-figure bonus. [pause] And I'm eating lunch alone at my desk, same as always. Checking emails from people who are terrified of me.
