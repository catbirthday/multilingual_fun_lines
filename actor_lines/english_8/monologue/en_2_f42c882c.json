[bitter] Fresh out of college, no experience, and they said yes. [pause] And now I'm sitting here with... with evidence that could destroy them. [regretful] The packet logs don't lie. They've been, um... they've been skimming from client accounts through the payment gateway. [frustrated] I mean, it's right there in the data! Little tiny amounts, but it's—Jesus, it's millions when you add it all up. [sigh] Mr. Chen personally mentored me. [very sad] He taught me everything about network security, and now I'm using those exact skills to... to expose him? [angry] But what am I supposed to do, pretend I didn't see it? [quietly] They're stealing from hospitals. From schools. [shaky voice] I keep thinking maybe there's, uh... maybe there's some explanation I'm missing? [laugh] Who am I kidding. The evidence is overwhelming. [hesitantly] Tomorrow morning, I hand everything over to the FBI. [long pause] They gave me my start, and I'm... I'm ending them. [whispering] I guess doing the right thing isn't supposed to feel this awful."
