There's like, um, there's actual brick back here. Not the cheap stuff they used in the seventies. [pause] This is... this is really old. [very quietly] Oh my God. There's writing on it. [excited] \"Founded 1847 by—\" I can't read the rest but— [gasp] there's more stuff back here! [very excited] Papers, they're wrapped in something, and is that... that's a photograph!
