=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very melancholic] People think I must be depressed, doing what I do. [chuckle] Digging graves all day, surrounded by death. But here's the thing—I've never felt more alive. [warm] Every funeral, I watch families tell stories. Real stories, you know? Not the polished résumé stuff, but the, um... the messy beautiful truth. [smiling speaking] Like yesterday, this woman's grandkids were laughing about how she'd sneak them candy before dinner. [pause] That's what matters. [very sincerely] Not the job title or the bank account. [sigh] I used to chase all that. [frustrated] Worked sixty-hour weeks at some corporate job, missed birthdays, postponed vacations. [short pause] Then I started digging graves. [quietly] And every single person I've buried? [empathetically] Their families never talk about quarterly reports. [laugh] They talk about Sunday dinners and terrible jokes and, uh... and dancing in kitchens. [very slowly] So now I leave work on time. [happy] I call my mom back. I eat dessert first sometimes. [passionately] Because I've learned that death isn't the opposite of life—forgetting to live is. [trailing off] And trust me, when you've dug enough graves, you realize... [confidently] celebration can't wait.
