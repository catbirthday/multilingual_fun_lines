All those times he'd pull her aside to \"help with dishes\" while I'm sitting there with her mom, making small talk about the weather. [pause] Three months. Three months he's been— God, and she never said anything. Not once. [shaky voice] I keep thinking about last week when he patted me on the back, called me \"son,\" asked about my promotion. The whole time he's been telling her to leave me? [angry] What kind of person does that? Smiles to your face and then— [sigh] And the worst part is she kept going. Every Sunday, she kept going back, kept listening to it. I don't even know what that means. Does she agree with him? Is she, um... is she considering it? [bitter] Twenty years I've been nothing but good to his daughter. Twenty years. We have two kids, a mortgage, a whole life, and he's been sitting there poisoning— [pause] I can't even look at her right now. She's in the kitchen acting like everything's normal. Making dinner like she didn't just accidentally let this slip. \"Oh, Dad's been saying that for months now.\" Like it's nothing. [very sad] Like my whole marriage isn't hanging by a thread I didn't even know was fraying."
