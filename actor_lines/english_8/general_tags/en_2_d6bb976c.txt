Scenario: A CFO boards her brother's cargo ship after discovering their family's shipping company has been smuggling contraband alongside legitimate cargo for years.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I found the manifests, Tommy—the real ones, not the doctored versions you've been filing with customs for the past three years.

Character 2: You shouldn't have come aboard, especially not in the middle of the night like this, not when we're twelve hours from international waters.

Character 1: Twelve hours from what?

Character 2: [quietly] From where corporate jurisdiction ends and maritime law begins, where your spreadsheets and quarterly reports mean absolutely nothing anymore.

Character 1: [incredulous] You're actually threatening me? Your own sister? The one who covered for you when you flunked out of business school to chase this salt water fantasy?

Character 2: [defensive] That fantasy built our father's empire into something real, something that actually moves through the world instead of just existing in portfolios and hedge funds.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Built it on what exactly? Because those containers marked 'agricultural equipment' sure as hell aren't carrying tractors, and we both know it.

Character 2: [steadying himself] Sometimes keeping a company alive means navigating waters you never planned to enter—you'd understand that if you ever left your corner office.

Character 1: Don't lecture me about survival when you're the one who's been systematically destroying everything Dad stood for, everything he believed this company could be.

Character 2: [simmering] Dad's dead, Maria. [exhales] He's been dead for five years, and his principles died with him when the banks started circling like sharks.

Character 1: [voice cracking] He trusted you with the fleet, trusted you to keep the family legacy clean, and this is what you've done with that faith?

Character 2: [firmly] I kept us afloat when your brilliant financial strategies would have seen every ship impounded and every crew member on the breadline.

Character 1: [desperately] There are other ways, Tommy—legal ways that don't involve smuggling God knows what for people who probably have blood on their hands.

Character 2: Legal ways. [hollow laugh] Like the bankruptcy filing you've been secretly preparing? Yeah, I know about that too—we both have our secrets, apparently.

Character 1: [pleading] That was a contingency plan, a last resort if we couldn't restructure the debt, but we still have options if you just stop this insanity.

Character 2: Stop? [sighs]

Character 1: [shakily] The authorities already know something's wrong—they've been asking questions about our routing patterns, about why we keep changing our navigation logs at the last minute.

Character 2: [resigned] Then you'd better decide quickly whether you're going to turn in your own brother or help me navigate us through this storm we're both caught in now.

Character 1: [whispered] How did we get here, Tommy? How did we go from Sunday dinners at Dad's house to me standing on your bridge, begging you not to destroy us?

Character 2: [softly] We got here one compromise at a time, one impossible choice after another, until the only way forward was through waters neither of us wanted to sail. [pause] But we're still family, Maria—that has to count for something.
