Scenario: A graphic designer hired to create a modern tourism campaign for a mountain kingdom discovers that the 'local legend' they're supposed to illustrate is actually the real dragon who's been protecting the valley for centuries.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [wearily] So, um, you're telling me that all those sketches I've been doing of a 'mythical beast' for the tourism board are actually, like, portraits of you? And you've been watching me work this whole time?

Character 2: More or less, yes.

Character 1: [incredulous laugh] Right, okay, well, this changes things considerably because I've been drawing you with, uh, significantly more teeth and claws than you apparently have. Also, I made your wings more bat-like for the Gothic tourism angle.

Character 2: [amused rumble] The teeth are actually quite accurate, though I do keep them retracted most of the time these days—it's more, hmm, socially acceptable when dealing with your kind. The wings, however, are frankly insulting.

Character 1: Look, I was working from medieval tapestries and, like, really questionable eyewitness accounts from the 1400s, so forgive me if the reference material was a bit, errr, dramatic. [nervous laugh] Should I be scared right now?

Character 2: You should be embarrassed about those color choices—crimson and gold, really? I'm clearly more of an iridescent jade with, [sighs], subtle bronze undertones in the right light, which you'd know if you'd bothered asking instead of assuming.

Character 1: [defensive] Hey, the tourism board specifically requested 'fierce and majestic' not 'subtle and nuanced,' okay? Besides, market research shows that red dragons test better with the eighteen to thirty-five demographic, which is, uh, apparently more important than accuracy.

Character 2: [dryly] Ah yes, market research—because nothing says authentic local culture quite like focus groups and demographic targeting. Tell me, did your research mention that I've been protecting this valley since before your language existed?

Character 1: Actually, no, that... that wasn't in the brief. [exhales] They just said to modernize the legend, make it more accessible, you know? Instagram-friendly, hashtag-able, that whole thing. God, this is so weird.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Perhaps we could find middle ground here—I'm not opposed to tourism, surprisingly, as it keeps developers from destroying the mountains, but these illustrations need to capture something, mmm, deeper than mere spectacle.

Character 1: So what, you want to art direct your own legend now? Because I've got to say, having the actual subject critique my work is, like, a first for me. Usually clients just send passive-aggressive emails.

Character 2: [warming] Oh, I've been art directing human interpretations for centuries—you should see what I had the Renaissance painters change. That ridiculous George fellow never even came here, yet somehow he's in half the paintings.

Character 1: [growing curious] Wait, you influenced Renaissance painters? That's actually, um, kind of incredible. Did you, like, pose for them or just terrorize them into accuracy?

Character 2: Bit of both.

Character 1: [excited now] Okay, this is actually becoming interesting because if you've been doing this for centuries, you basically have the longest-running PR campaign in history. We could totally use that angle—tradition meets innovation, ancient wisdom for modern travelers.

Character 2: [pleased rumble] Now you're beginning to understand—this isn't about creating a fiction but about translating a truth that most humans aren't, hmm, equipped to process directly. Your little drawings are just the latest iteration.

Character 1: Right, yeah.

Character 2: The question is whether you can capture something real while still making it, what did you say, hashtag-able? Because I've seen what passes for authenticity in your world, and it's usually anything but.

Character 1: [determined] You know what? Challenge accepted. Give me a week, let me actually observe you properly—not through some terrified monk's description—and I'll create something that's both true and, uh, marketable. [pause] If you don't eat me first.

Character 2: [laughing, a sound like distant thunder] Young one, if I ate every artist who got my proportions wrong, there'd be no art history left. Besides, [contentedly], it's been ages since someone's actually asked to get it right.
