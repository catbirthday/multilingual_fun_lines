=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [frozen] Jesus Christ, Marcus, you can't be here—not bleeding all over my prep station at two in the morning when I have three hundred covers tomorrow.

Character 2: [breathlessly] Please, Elena, I know how this looks but there's nowhere else I could go, and the bullet's still in there somewhere near my ribs.

Character 1: The Marcus I knew five years ago was a sous chef who wanted to open a food truck, not someone who shows up shot in my kitchen. [sharp exhale]

Character 2: [grimacing] Yeah well, the food truck didn't exactly work out, and certain people pay better than minimum wage for certain skills I apparently possess.

Character 1: [hushed] You're dripping blood on imported marble that costs more than most people's cars, and if hotel security finds you here, we're both finished.

Character 2: Just give me twenty minutes to stop the bleeding and I'll disappear again, I swear—you'll never have to see me after tonight. [labored breathing]

Character 1: God, you're still the same selfish bastard, aren't you? Showing up when you need something, making it my problem, my risk, my career on the line.

Character 2: [weakly] That's fair, completely fair, but Elena, if I pass out in an alley somewhere, they'll find me by morning and trace everything back.

Character 1: [reluctantly] There's a first aid kit in the office, industrial grade, and I can get morphine from the executive chef's migraine stash if you need it.

Character 2: No drugs, they make me sloppy, and whoever's looking for me won't stop just because I'm wounded—they're probably checking hospitals right now. [groans]

Character 1: Who exactly is 'they,' Marcus? Because if you've brought cartel violence into my kitchen, into my life again, I need to know what I'm dealing with.

Character 2: [exhausted laugh] Not cartel this time, just a very unhappy politician who didn't appreciate me declining his latest contract after taking the advance payment.

Character 1: You took money and didn't finish the job? Christ, even I know that's basically signing your own death warrant in your line of work.

Character 2: The target was a kid, Elena—seventeen years old, some witness to something—and I might be a killer but I'm not that far gone yet. [coughs]

Character 1: [softer] So you do still have some lines you won't cross, that's oddly comforting to know after everything that's happened between us.

Character 2: [struggling] Don't read too much into it, I'm still the disappointment who chose bullets over béchamel sauce, remember? This doesn't change anything.

Character 1: [firmly] Shut up and let me look at the wound—if you die in my kitchen, the health inspector will have my head, noble intentions or not.

Character 2: Always the practical one, even when patching up your ex who became everything you warned me against becoming. [winces] God, that hurts.

Character 1: Hold still, this is going to hurt worse—and Marcus? After tonight, after I clean you up and send you out that service door, we're truly done.

Character 2: [quietly] I know, Elena, I've always known that some mistakes can't be undone, some paths only lead further into darkness. [resigned sigh] Thank you.
