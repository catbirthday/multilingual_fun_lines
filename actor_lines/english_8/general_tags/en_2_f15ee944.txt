Scenario: A linguistics professor discovers that the university's new janitor is actually a former literature professor from Damascus, now working the only job his refugee status allows.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [surprised] You're the new janitor? But I've seen your handwriting on those supply request forms—that's classical Arabic calligraphy, the kind they don't teach anymore.

Character 2: Most people here just see a mop and bucket, not the hands that hold them. Yes, I studied calligraphy back home, among other things that don't matter much now.

Character 1: [gently] They matter. I teach linguistics here, and that script you write—it's beautiful, almost poetic in its precision. Where did you learn such formal techniques?

Character 2: Damascus University, though that feels like someone else's life entirely. [soft laugh] I taught literature there for fifteen years before the war made poets into refugees and professors into janitors.

Character 1: [stunned] You were a literature professor? My God, and here you are emptying my trash while I complain about freshman essays. This is—this is completely backwards.

Character 2: Backwards, forwards, these directions lose meaning when you're grateful just to be alive and working. [sighs] Your trash can doesn't judge my accent or question my credentials.

Character 1: Your credentials are probably more impressive than half our faculty's. Look, I know the department has some adjunct positions opening up, maybe we could find a way to—

Character 2: [wistful] You're kind, but my degrees are ashes now, literally burned with the university library. Here, I'm nobody's colleague, just Ahmad who cleans well and stays quiet.

Character 1: That's not true. Knowledge doesn't burn, Ahmad. If you taught literature for fifteen years, that expertise is still there, still valuable, still needed.

Character 2: Needed? [bitter laugh] I've sent over two hundred applications using my real qualifications. The only callback I got was for this janitor position.

Character 1: [firmly] Then the system is broken, not you. Would you consider guest lecturing in my comparative literature seminar? Just one class, talking about Arabic poetry, paid of course.

Character 2: You want me to stand before your students? They'll see a janitor playing professor, not a scholar sharing knowledge. [quieter] I'm not sure I remember how to be that person anymore.

Character 1: You never stopped being that person. Every note you leave in perfect calligraphy, every time you reorganize my scattered books by linguistic origin—you're still teaching, just differently.

Character 2: [slowly warming] You noticed the book organizing? I couldn't help myself; seeing Rumi next to automotive manuals physically hurt me.

Character 1: [chuckles] I thought I was going crazy! But it made so much more sense your way. Please, one guest lecture. Let me introduce you properly to the academic community here.

Character 2: One lecture. [exhales] But I choose the topic—not refugee poetry or war literature. I want to teach them about Al-Mutanabbi, about beauty that existed before everything burned.

Character 1: Absolutely, whatever you want to teach. We'll start with one class and see what happens. Sometimes the smallest door opens onto the largest room.

Character 2: [voice lifting] There's an old saying—'The ink of scholars is holier than the blood of martyrs.' Perhaps some ink remains in these janitor's hands after all.

Character 1: More than remains, Ahmad. [warmly] It's been waiting to flow again. How's next Thursday at 2 PM? I'll make sure the department knows exactly who they're hearing from.

Character 2: [genuinely moved] Thursday at 2 PM. I'll be there, and for once, I won't be carrying a mop. Thank you for seeing what others choose not to see.
