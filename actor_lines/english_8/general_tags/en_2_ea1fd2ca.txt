Scenario: A religious martyr seeking refuge from authorities discovers the vineyard manager is the sibling they abandoned fifteen years ago when they chose their calling over family.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [wearily] God, it's you.

Character 2: [frozen] I heard someone was hiding in the tool shed last night, figured it was kids or maybe migrants, but never—[sharp exhale]—never thought I'd see you again, not after fifteen years.

Character 1: [hollow] I know.

Character 2: [bitter laugh] You know? That's all you have to say after abandoning mom and dad to chase your calling, your great purpose, leaving me to watch them die wondering where their firstborn went?

Character 1: The authorities are looking for me, David, they've already killed three others from our group, and I just need somewhere safe for maybe two nights. [quieter] Then I'll disappear again.

Character 2: You think you can just show up bleeding in my vineyard, the one I built from nothing while you were off playing prophet, and I'm supposed to what—pretend we're family?

Character 1: [exhausted] I never stopped being your sister, even when I left, even when I knew it would destroy everything between us.

Character 2: [scathing] Sister? You were supposed to be at dad's funeral, at mom's bedside when the cancer took her, but instead you were, [voice breaking], where exactly? Saving souls?

Character 1: I was in prison for four months that year, being tortured for refusing to renounce our faith community, though I suppose that sounds like an excuse to you.

Character 2: [softer] Jesus, Sarah, look at your hands—those scars, they're not just from last night, are they?

Character 1: [matter-of-fact] Burns mostly, some cuts that got infected, but that's not important right now—if they find me here, they'll burn your whole vineyard down.

Character 2: [resigned sigh] The harvest crew left yesterday for the season, so the bunkhouse is empty and has its own well, no one would know you're there.

Character 1: [surprised] After everything I've done to you, to our family, you'd still risk your entire life's work for me?

Character 2: [dryly] Mom made me promise on her deathbed that if you ever came back, no matter what state you were in, I had to at least feed you. [pause] She never stopped hoping.

Character 1: [voice cracking] I dream about her every night, about both of them, about the life I threw away to follow something I thought was bigger than myself.

Character 2: [firmly] Don't do that, don't you dare make this about your guilt when you chose this path with both eyes open.

Character 1: [steady] You're right, I did choose it, and I'd probably choose it again because someone has to stand up to them, even if it costs everything. [softer] Even if it cost me you.

Character 2: [tiredly] The bunkhouse has canned food and medical supplies in the cabinet above the sink, and there's a truck with keys in the visor if you need to run.

Character 1: [gently] David, when this is over, if I survive it, I want to come back and help you with the harvest, like we used to do at grandfather's place.

Character 2: We both know you won't survive it, Sarah—martyrs never do, that's rather the point, isn't it? [defeated] But sure, if by some miracle you do, the grapes will be here waiting.
