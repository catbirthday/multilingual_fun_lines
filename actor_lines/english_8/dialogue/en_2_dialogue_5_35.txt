=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I noticed you've been avoiding the main conference room lately. Everything okay?

Character 2: I've been using the smaller meeting spaces when I can. The main room has this acoustic issue that really bothers me—everything echoes and overlaps, makes it hard to concentrate on what people are actually saying.

Character 1: Is it really that bad? I hadn't noticed.

Character 2: Most people don't notice, but I pick up on every side conversation, every chair squeak, every phone vibration. It all compresses together into this wall of noise that makes my chest feel tight, like I'm being pressed from all sides.

Character 1: That sounds overwhelming. Have you talked to facilities about it?

Character 2: I brought it up once and they suggested I sit closer to the speaker. They don't understand that proximity doesn't help when the problem is the sheer volume of sensory input crushing in from every direction.

Character 1: Maybe we could move our team meetings to the fourth floor?

Character 2: That would be incredible, actually. The fourth floor rooms have proper sound dampening and the lighting doesn't flicker at that barely-perceptible frequency that makes my skin crawl.

Character 1: [pause] I had no idea you were dealing with all this.

Character 2: [anxious] It's not something I usually discuss because people tend to think I'm being difficult or overly sensitive. But sometimes it feels like the world is literally closing in, like invisible hands are squeezing my ribcage whenever there's too much stimulation.

Character 1: That's not being difficult. That's a real experience you're having.

Character 2: Thank you for saying that. Most days I can manage it fine, but open offices are basically designed to maximize the exact kind of environmental pressure that makes my nervous system go haywire.

Character 1: Is there anything else that helps besides quieter spaces?

Character 2: Noise-canceling headphones are a lifesaver, though wearing them all day makes me feel isolated. It's this constant trade-off between feeling squeezed by sensory overload or cut off from human connection entirely.

Character 1: Would it help if we scheduled regular one-on-one check-ins? Less overwhelming than group meetings?

Character 2: That would take so much pressure off, honestly. One-on-one conversations let me actually focus on the person instead of feeling like I'm being compressed by competing voices and movements from every angle.

Character 1: [extremely happy] Perfect! Let's make that happen starting next week.

Character 2: [confused] Wait, you're actually restructuring things just to accommodate me? Most managers would tell me to adapt or find coping strategies, not change the entire meeting structure.

Character 1: Why would I force you to suffer when we can easily adjust?

Character 2: I don't know what to say. This is the first time someone's understood that it's not about weakness or preference—it's about my brain literally interpreting the environment as an ongoing physical pressure that never stops squeezing.
