=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I was watching this court show yesterday and it got me thinking about legal stuff.

Character 2: Court shows are actually fascinating windows into how disconnected people are from real legal processes. Most of what happens on TV bears zero resemblance to actual courtrooms, which move at glacial pace compared to Judge Judy.

Character 1: Yeah but like, how different can it really be?

Character 2: Night and day different. Real trials can stretch for months, witnesses get prepped for weeks, and judges rarely make snap decisions. The average civil case takes 18 to 24 months just to reach trial, not the 30 minutes you see on television.

Character 1: That sounds incredibly boring though.

Character 2: Absolutely.

Character 1: Wait, you're agreeing with me?

Character 2: Why wouldn't I? Legal proceedings are designed to be methodical and thorough, not entertaining. That's precisely why court shows exist—nobody would watch actual depositions where lawyers spend three hours arguing about document discovery procedures.

Character 1: [empathetically] Must be rough for people going through it.

Character 2: The emotional toll is real. Imagine your life being on hold for years while lawyers exchange paperwork. The average divorce takes 11 months, bankruptcy can drag on for five years, and some criminal cases take a decade to fully resolve with appeals.

Character 1: [laugh hysterically] A decade! That's insane!

Character 2: And that's in countries with functioning legal systems. In India, there are currently 40 million pending cases—some property disputes have been in court since the 1950s, literally passed down through generations of the same family.

Character 1: How is that even possible?

Character 2: [over confidently] Simple mathematics really. When you have 20 judges per million people trying to handle complex legal frameworks inherited from British colonial rule mixed with local customs, the backlog becomes inevitable and self-perpetuating.

Character 1: Makes our system look lightning fast.

Character 2: Comparatively, yes. The US has about 110 judges per million people, though even here, federal courts have a backlog of around 400,000 cases at any given moment, which creates its own set of problems.

Character 1: Like what kind of problems?

Character 2: [loudly] Plea bargaining! Ninety-seven percent of federal criminal cases never see trial because the system would literally collapse if they did—we'd need ten times more judges, prosecutors, and public defenders just to handle current caseloads!

Character 1: So basically everyone just makes deals to avoid the mess.

Character 2: Exactly. The entire American legal system runs on the assumption that almost nobody will exercise their constitutional right to trial. It's a massive machine built on compromise, not the adversarial justice we see in movies.
