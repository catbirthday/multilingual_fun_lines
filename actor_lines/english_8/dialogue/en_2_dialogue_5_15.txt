=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You're leaving. After everything we built here—you're actually leaving.

Character 2: Listen, I've been, um, wrestling with this for months now. It's not about abandoning what we created, it's about... hell, it's about recognizing when something's reached its natural conclusion, you know?

Character 1: Natural conclusion? We're on the verge of the breakthrough!

Character 2: Are we though? I mean, really? Because from where I'm standing, we've been chasing this same, uh, phantom for three years now, and every breakthrough turns into another dead end, another... another beautiful failure.

Character 1: So you're just giving up.

Character 2: [monotone] No. God, no. That's not—that's not what this is. I'm choosing to redirect my energy toward something that might actually, you know, bear fruit in my lifetime.

Character 1: What about the investors? What am I supposed to tell them?

Character 2: Tell them the truth. That we tried, that we pushed boundaries nobody else would even, um, approach. That sometimes the most valuable discoveries come from knowing when to, uh... when to pivot.

Character 1: Pivot. Christ, you sound like one of them now.

Character 2: [overly polite] Well, perhaps that's because I've learned to speak their language, which, frankly, is something you might consider attempting occasionally instead of, oh, burning every bridge you cross with your righteous indignation.

Character 1: My righteous—? You believed in this as much as I did!

Character 2: I still believe in it! That's the tragedy here, don't you see? I believe in it so much that I, uh, I can't watch it consume us anymore, can't keep pretending that belief alone is enough to sustain this thing.

Character 1: [relieved] Then stay. Please. We'll restructure, we'll find new funding—

Character 2: Absolutely.

Character 1: [pause] Wait... you'll stay?

Character 2: No, I—sorry, I was agreeing that we'd find new funding, you would, but... ahh, this is exactly what I mean, we're not even hearing each other anymore, are we?

Character 1: I hear you perfectly. You're scared.

Character 2: Damn right I'm scared. I'm terrified of waking up at fifty having spent my entire life on, um, on something that only existed in our heads, you know? Some of us need more than just beautiful theories.

Character 1: The prototype works. You've seen it work.

Character 2: For seventeen seconds, yeah. Seventeen glorious seconds before it, uh, melted itself into modern art. But hey, those seventeen seconds? They were magnificent. They really were. And maybe... maybe that has to be enough.
