=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I've been reading Marshall Goldsmith's book about executive coaching. Do you use his methods with your clients at McKinsey?

Character 2: Oh, Marshall's feedforward technique is, um, pretty revolutionary actually. I've been incorporating it with the Goldman Sachs team for about six months now, and honestly the results are way better than traditional feedback models.

Character 1: That makes sense. How do you handle resistance from senior partners?

Character 2: Man, that's the million dollar question. So I usually start by referencing Peter Drucker's work on management effectiveness, because, I mean, everyone at Deloitte and PwC respects Drucker, right? Then I kind of ease into showing them their 360 feedback data.

Character 1: [very loudly] Yes! That's exactly what Jennifer said at the Harvard Business Review conference!

Character 2: Jennifer Garvey Berger? Gosh, her work on adult development theory is, er, absolutely game-changing for leadership coaching. I've been using her simple, complicated, complex framework with the Microsoft executives, and it really helps them see their blind spots.

Character 1: [enunciating every word] How do you integrate that with Tony Robbins' more motivational approach?

Character 2: [hesitantly] Well, um, that's... that's actually tricky because Robbins operates from this really high-energy NLP foundation, whereas someone like Nancy Kline with her Thinking Environment methodology is much more, uh, contemplative and structured.

Character 1: Right, I can see the tension there. What about for Silicon Valley clients?

Character 2: Okay look, Silicon Valley is its own beast entirely. When I'm working with folks from Google or Meta, I lean heavily into Bill Campbell's trillion dollar coach approach—you know, really direct, no-nonsense, but still deeply caring about the person's growth.

Character 1: Bill Campbell coached Steve Jobs, right? And Eric Schmidt?

Character 2: [chuckle] Yeah exactly, plus the founders at Twitter and Intuit. The thing about Campbell's method is it wasn't, mmm, fancy or theoretical—he just asked really pointed questions and held people accountable to their own standards.

Character 1: That sounds more practical than what they teach at INSEAD's coaching certification.

Character 2: Oh absolutely. INSEAD and Wharton have these, er, really comprehensive frameworks, but honestly when you're sitting across from a CEO at JPMorgan Chase who has fifteen minutes, you need to cut through the academic stuff pretty quickly.

Character 1: Makes sense. Do you ever use Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence framework?

Character 2: All the time, especially with the Wells Fargo leadership team. Goleman's work on self-awareness and, um, social awareness is basically foundational now—I mean, you can't really coach executives without addressing EQ alongside their strategic thinking capabilities.

Character 1: What about newer approaches like Brené Brown's vulnerability work?

Character 2: Brené's research is, gosh, incredibly powerful for certain contexts. I've used her Dare to Lead curriculum with teams at Amazon and Netflix, and it's particularly effective when you're dealing with, uh, cultures that have gotten really toxic or fear-based.

Character 1: I appreciate how you're blending all these different methodologies.

Character 2: Yeah, I mean, whether you're using John Whitmore's GROW model or David Rock's SCARF framework from the NeuroLeadership Institute, the key is really matching the approach to what the client needs in that moment, not forcing them into your preferred system.
