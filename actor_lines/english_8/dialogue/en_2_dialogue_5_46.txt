Character 1: [shy] Um, do you know anything about Y Combinator's acceptance rate? It's around 1.5%.

Character 2: Huh, yeah actually, I had a client go through YC last year. The acceptance rate's brutal but, I mean, they get like forty thousand applications per batch, so mathematically it's gotta be that low, right?

Character 1: Your client was a founder? That's unexpected.

Character 2: Look, I protect a lot of tech executives these days. Techstars has a, uh, slightly better rate at around 2%, but honestly both programs are incredibly selective—you basically need either insane traction or a really compelling team.

Character 1: What's the typical equity stake these accelerators take?

Character 2: YC takes 7% for $500k now, which is, mmm, pretty standard. Techstars is similar—they do 6% for $120k, though some of their vertical programs have different terms depending on the, er, specific industry focus.

Character 1: That seems like significant dilution for early-stage companies.

Character 2: Right so, it's actually not terrible when you factor in the network value. One of my clients calculated that YC's alumni network alone increased their Series A valuation by, oh, roughly 40% compared to non-accelerator peers.

Character 1: What about international programs like Station F or Antler?

Character 2: Station F is more of an, umm, incubation campus than a traditional accelerator—they don't take equity directly. Antler's different though, they'll put in like $100-270k for 9-20% depending on the geography, which is honestly pretty aggressive dilution.

Character 1: How do you know all this technical stuff?

Character 2: Man, when you're standing outside conference rooms for twelve hours a day, you kind of absorb everything. Plus I've protected founders through, uh, maybe fifteen different demo days now—you pick up the patterns pretty quickly.

Character 1: What's the average graduation rate from these programs?

Character 2: Jeez, that's harder to track. Most accelerators claim 90-95% graduation rates, but the real metric is, er, how many survive past eighteen months—that drops to maybe 60% for even the top-tier programs.

Character 1: Do corporate accelerators like Disney or Microsoft's have different models?

Character 2: [gasp softly] Oh absolutely, corporate ones are totally different beasts. They typically don't take equity at all, instead they're fishing for strategic partnerships or, mmm, potential acquisitions—it's more about innovation pipeline than financial returns.

Character 1: What happens to companies that fail during the program?

Character 2: [very sad] Look, I've seen founders completely break down when they realize it's not working. The accelerators usually let them, uh, keep going through the motions till demo day, but everyone kind of knows, and it's... it's rough watching that slow collapse happen.

Character 1: That must be difficult to witness repeatedly.

Character 2: [mumbling] Yeah it's, um, the worst part of this job honestly. You get attached to these people, watching them pour everything into something that might not work, and you can't really do anything except, I guess, make sure they get home safe.
