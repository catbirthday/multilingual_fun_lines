Character 1: What the hell are you doing with those speakers during the sermon?

Character 2: Whoa, okay, um, I'm trying to fix the feedback issue that's been, like, destroying everyone's ears for the past twenty minutes. The whole sound system in this place is, honestly, held together with prayers and duct tape, so I'm doing what I can here.

Character 1: You can't just walk around up there while the pastor's speaking!

Character 2: Look, I get it, really, but if I don't adjust these monitors right now, that screeching is gonna come back and, uh, completely drown out whatever message he's trying to deliver. Would you rather have me visible for thirty seconds or, I mean, have nobody hear the actual sermon?

Character 1: This is completely unprofessional!

Character 2: [laugh histerically] Unprofessional? Man, I've been doing church gigs for fifteen years and, erhm, trust me when I say this is actually going pretty smoothly compared to some disasters I've seen.

Character 1: [animated] You think this is funny? This is a sacred space!

Character 2: No no no, I'm not—look, I respect what this place means to people, okay? But the thing is, your sacred space needs, um, functioning equipment to actually serve its purpose, and right now we're working with gear that should've been replaced in, like, 2005.

Character 1: [overly polite] Perhaps you could have addressed these issues before the service began?

Character 2: Oh believe me, I tried—I got here at six this morning to do soundcheck but, uh, apparently nobody told me the whole system was rewired last week by some volunteer who, hmm, clearly didn't know what they were doing. So now I'm basically troubleshooting a completely different setup than what I prepared for, you know?

Character 1: That's not an excuse to disrupt worship!

Character 2: [very slowly] Listen... I understand... that you're upset... but every minute we stand here arguing is another minute that, erhm, feedback could blow out someone's hearing aid or make a kid cry.

Character 1: Fine, but you need to be more discreet!

Character 2: Discreet? I'm crawling behind the altar on my hands and knees trying to trace cables that are, like, literally tangled into some kind of electronic rat's nest back there. There's only so invisible I can make myself while, uh, wrestling with fifty pounds of audio equipment, honestly.

Character 1: Just get it done quickly then!

Character 2: That's exactly what I'm trying to do, but see, when people keep stopping me to complain about the very problem I'm actively solving, it kind of, mmm, slows down the whole process, doesn't it?

Character 1: Don't get smart with me!

Character 2: [smiling speaking] Hey, I'm not trying to be smart, I'm just, well, extremely passionate about making sure your congregation can actually hear the word of God without their eardrums bleeding. That's literally why you hired me, right?

Character 1: We hired you to be professional and prepared!

Character 2: And I am both of those things, which is, uh, exactly why I'm up here fixing someone else's mess instead of letting your service turn into an acoustic nightmare. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got about, hmm, thirty seconds to prevent the next feedback loop before the choir starts.
