Scenario: A district attorney confronts their childhood best friend who has been secretly leaking case details to the mob for years, discovered only after a key witness was murdered.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [exhausted] Twenty years, Marcus. Twenty years of Sunday dinners, being godfather to your kids, and all this time you were feeding them information. [pause] How many people died because of you?

Character 2: [defensive] You don't understand the position I was in. [quickly] They had leverage on me from before we even met—my father's debts, things that would've destroyed my family completely.

Character 1: [firmly] Jennifer Reeves is dead. [bitter] A twenty-three-year-old teacher who witnessed a murder, and you gave them her safe house location. I watched her mother collapse at the morgue. [trailing off]

Character 2: [desperate] I never meant—

Character 1: [furious] Don't you dare finish that sentence. [slowly] You knew exactly what would happen when you made that call. You chose thirty pieces of silver over an innocent woman's life.

Character 2: [pleading] Listen to me, they threatened Emma and the kids! [shaky voice] What was I supposed to do, let them hurt my family? You would've done the same thing in my position.

Character 1: No, I wouldn't have. [sighs] I would've come to you, my best friend, the district attorney, and asked for help instead of becoming their puppet for a decade.

Character 2: [angry] Easy for you to say from your high horse! [loudly] You grew up with money, with choices. Some of us had to survive however we could. [coughs]

Character 1: [very quietly] Survival?

Character 2: [bitter] You think wearing a wire makes you noble? [sarcastic] How many deals have you cut with criminals to get convictions? We both compromise our morals, I just got caught on the wrong side. [pause]

Character 1: [stern] Stop it.

Character 2: [desperately] Please, think about Emma and the kids—they don't know anything about this. [crying while speaking] If you send me to prison, they'll lose everything. Their father, their home, their future. Is that justice?

Character 1: [regretful] They already lost their father the day you decided to betray everything we stood for. [firmly] The Marcus I knew, the one I loved like a brother, he's been gone for years. [sighs]

Character 2: [very quietly] So that's it then? [trembling] Twenty years of friendship, being there when your father died, when Sarah left you—none of that matters now?

Character 1: [exhausted] It all matters. [slowly] That's what makes this so much harder. But Jennifer Reeves mattered too. The other witnesses you exposed mattered. The cases you sabotaged mattered. [pause]

Character 2: [mocking] Such righteousness from someone who's destroyed families in court without blinking. [bitter] At least I felt guilty about what I did. You sleep like a baby after every conviction. [trailing off]

Character 1: [firmly] I sleep knowing I fight for justice, not for the Torrino crime family. [very quietly] There's a difference between prosecuting criminals and becoming one, Marcus.

Character 2: [defeated] You've already made up your mind, haven't you? [sighs] This conversation is just you saying goodbye. Well, congratulations, counselor. You got your man.

Character 1: [warmly] I did love you like a brother, you know. [very sad] That person you were at my father's funeral, holding me up when I couldn't stand—I'll mourn that man.

Character 2: [whispering] I'm still that person, David. [desperately] Underneath all of this mess and these terrible choices, I'm still me. [sniffle] Please, there has to be another way. Please.
