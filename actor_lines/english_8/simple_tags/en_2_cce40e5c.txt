Scenario: An audiologist discovers their estranged sibling, now a corporate development analyst, has lost significant hearing from years of avoiding treatment after their childhood accident together.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [warm] You're compensating by reading lips, tilting your head to favor your left ear, and you've positioned yourself against the wall for sound reflection. [quietly] Classic signs of untreated progressive hearing loss, Marcus.

Character 2: [defensive] Don't start with the professional diagnosis routine, not after twelve years of silence between us. [bitter] I came here for the merger documents, not a family intervention disguised as medical concern.

Character 1: [gently] The explosion at the quarry damaged both our ears that summer, but yours took the brunt of it when you pushed me behind that rock. [very quietly] You never told Mom and Dad how bad it really was.

Character 2: [firmly] Corporate development requires reading spreadsheets and market analyses, not perfect hearing. [frustrated] I've built an entire career without anyone noticing, closed billion-dollar deals while you were studying cochlear implants and frequency ranges.

Character 1: [passionately] You're missing sixty percent of consonant sounds in normal conversation, probably more in those boardrooms with their glass walls and echo chambers. [sighs] How many meetings have you smiled through without catching the critical details?

Character 2: [anxious] The merger presentation is tomorrow and I've memorized every possible question they could ask. [quickly] Visual aids, written proposals, email follow-ups—I've adapted my entire methodology to never need to hear a single word clearly.

Character 1: Marcus, please.

Character 2: [very quietly] You became an audiologist because of what happened to us that day, trying to fix everyone else because you couldn't fix me. [pause] But I never asked to be fixed, never wanted your guilt wrapped up in medical degrees.

Character 1: [empathetically] The technology now is nothing like what existed when we were kids. [warm] Digital processing, directional microphones, Bluetooth connectivity that would sync with all your presentation equipment—you'd actually hear better than most people in those meetings.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Mom calls every week asking if I've reached out to you, pretending she doesn't know about my hearing when she's been covering for me at family dinners for over a decade. [laughs] She thinks we're both too stubborn to make the first move.

Character 1: [affectionately] Remember when we used to practice sign language in the treehouse, making up ridiculous gestures for curse words so the parents wouldn't understand? [chuckles] You were always better at it than me, more creative with the combinations.

Character 2: [warm] You tried to teach the entire neighborhood kids our made-up signs, convinced we'd invented a new universal language. [smiling speaking] Mrs. Peterson was horrified when she figured out what her son was actually signing during church.

Character 1: Still works, though.

Character 2: [laughs] Really?

Character 1: [playful] I use our old signs with my pediatric patients when they're scared, telling them silly things about the equipment to make them laugh. [very sincerely] The one you made up for 'brave' is still my favorite—that little fist bump against the heart.

Character 2: [very quietly] The merger is with a medical device company, actually—they manufacture the same hearing aid components your clinic probably uses. [hesitantly] I've been reading about their technology for months, understanding more than I wanted to about what I've been missing.

Character 1: [gently] You could come to my clinic after hours, no paperwork, no insurance claims, just us figuring out what might help. [warm] We could start with a simple assessment, see where things stand after all these years.

Character 2: [anxious] What if it's too late, what if the damage is beyond what technology can compensate for? [very quietly] I've built my entire identity around working harder than everyone else to hide this, and I'm terrified of who I'd be without that constant effort.

Character 1: [firmly] You'd be my brother who saved my hearing by taking the worst of that blast, who deserves to experience conversations without exhaustion, music without gaps, and maybe even forgiveness—from both of us. [pause] The appointment book is in my desk drawer.

Character 2: [warm] After the merger presentation, after I've closed this deal that's consumed two years of my life. [affectionately] Then we can sit in your fancy audiologist chair and you can tell me all about the frequencies I've been missing, maybe even hear you properly call me an idiot for waiting so long.
