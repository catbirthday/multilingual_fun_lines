Scenario: An algorithmic trader who lost everything in a market crash accidentally enters the wrong building—a community center where the venue manager is preparing for the final event before demolition.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong building—I was looking for the bankruptcy attorney's office on Tenth Street, but [exhales] everything looks different when your whole world's collapsing.

Character 2: [gently] You're in the old Riverside Community Center, and Tenth Street is two blocks north. [pause] Though if you need a minute to sit down, we've still got chairs out for tonight's farewell event.

Character 1: [bitter] Farewell event? [laughs] That's fitting—seems like everything's ending these days, including my fourteen-year career that vanished in twelve seconds when the algorithm went rogue.

Character 2: [empathetically] They're demolishing this place tomorrow after forty years of serving the neighborhood. [sighs] Every wedding reception, every AA meeting, every kids' birthday party—all of it becomes rubble at dawn.

Character 1: [frustrated] At least buildings leave debris behind as proof they existed. [very quietly] When digital fortunes evaporate, there's nothing left but error logs and margin calls that no one will ever read.

Character 2: [warmly] You know what's strange? [chuckles] In all my years managing this place, the most meaningful moments happened by accident—people who wandered in lost and found something they weren't looking for.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Great, so I accidentally stumbled into life lesson territory while trying to declare bankruptcy. [exhales] Next you'll tell me everything happens for a reason or some other platitude.

Character 2: [firmly] No platitudes, just an observation from someone who's watched thousands of endings in this room. [pause] Divorces finalized, businesses folded, support groups disbanded—but somehow people kept showing up.

Character 1: [curious] Why would anyone keep coming back to a place that's literally scheduled for demolition? [quietly] Don't they know when something's done, it's done?

Character 2: [passionately] Because tonight isn't about the building—it's about the janitor who worked here thirty years, the dance teacher who started in this very room. [clearing throat] They're coming to honor what happened here, not mourn the walls.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I spent every waking hour for over a decade staring at screens, optimizing microsecond advantages, building systems that could trade faster than human thought. [sighs] Never once considered what it was actually building toward.

Character 2: [gently] The bankruptcy attorney's office can wait an hour, you know. [warmly] We're starting soon—just neighborhood people sharing stories, eating potluck casseroles, pretending the acoustic guitar guy isn't terrible.

Character 1: [shaky voice] I don't belong there.

Character 2: [very sincerely] Nobody belongs at a demolition party—that's what makes it honest. [pause] Besides, the woman who makes the potato salad used to run a hedge fund before she discovered community gardens.

Character 1: [confused] You're telling me a hedge fund manager is bringing potato salad to a condemned community center? [laughs] What kind of alternate reality did I accidentally walk into?

Character 2: [playful] The kind where a Wall Street algorithm going haywire leads you through the wrong door at exactly the right moment. [chuckles] She'll probably want to hear your story—misery loves company, especially with mayo and celery.

Character 1: [exhales] Fine, one hour.

Character 2: [relieved] Good, because I already set aside a folding chair for you—the wobbly one that forces you to lean forward and actually engage with people. [sighs] It's been breaking ice since 1987.

Character 1: [reluctantly] This is insane, you realize that, right? [quietly] An hour ago I was googling bankruptcy lawyers and now I'm about to eat potato salad in a building that won't exist tomorrow.

Character 2: [very quietly] Sometimes the best endings are the ones you accidentally stumble into while looking for something else entirely. [pause] Come on, the acoustic guitar guy is actually pretty good when he's not trying so hard.
