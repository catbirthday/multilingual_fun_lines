Scenario: A therapist discovers their normally reserved next-door neighbor sitting on their shared apartment building stairwell at 2 AM, having just received news of a terminal diagnosis.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [very quietly] David? Is that you sitting out here? [pause] I'm sorry, I don't mean to intrude, I just came up to grab something from my storage unit and I saw you.

Character 2: [monotone] Yeah, it's me. [sighs] Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd sit out here for a while where the walls don't feel like they're closing in on me.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I know we've been neighbors for three years but barely talk beyond mail mix-ups and hallway hellos. [very quietly] But something tells me you're not okay right now, and sitting alone on cold stairs at two in the morning isn't helping.

Character 2: [bitter] Not okay is an understatement. [exhales] Got a call from my doctor six hours ago with test results I've been dreading, and now I can't stop calculating how many months I might have left.

Character 1: [empathetically] That's an impossible weight to carry alone, especially in these first hours when everything feels surreal and overwhelming. [very softly] I won't pretend to know exactly what you're feeling, but I've sat with many people receiving similar news.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Six to eight months.

Character 1: [warmly] Those numbers must be screaming in your head right now, drowning out everything else. [pause] But right now, in this moment, you're here, you're breathing, and you don't have to process this alone if you don't want to.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I haven't told anyone yet, not my sister, not my ex-wife, nobody. [sniffles] You're literally the first person I've said the words out loud to, and we barely know each other.

Character 1: [gently] Sometimes it's easier to speak the hardest truths to someone without all the complicated history and expectations. [very quietly] There's no performance required here, no need to be strong or optimistic or anything other than exactly what you are right now.

Character 2: I keep thinking about all the stupid stuff I worried about yesterday, like my quarterly report and whether to refinance my mortgage. [bitter laugh] God, what a waste of mental energy on things that don't matter anymore.

Character 1: [very sincerely] Those things mattered yesterday because you were living a different life yesterday, one where the future stretched out predictably. [sighs] It's not stupid to have cared about normal things before your world shifted.

Character 2: [whispering] I'm scared of the pain, but more than that, I'm terrified of becoming a burden, of losing myself piece by piece while everyone watches. [voice breaking] My dad went through this and it was horrible.

Character 1: Watching someone you love go through this shapes how you imagine your own journey, I understand that fear completely. [empathetically] But your story doesn't have to be his story, and there are more resources and support options now than even five years ago.

Character 2: [exhausted] I should probably try to sleep, process this when my brain isn't running on fumes and shock. [pause] Thank you for stopping, for not just walking past like this was none of your business.

Character 1: [warmly] My door is literally fifteen feet from yours, and I mean this sincerely when I say you can knock anytime, day or night. [very quietly] Processing this will take time, and you shouldn't have to do it in isolation.

Character 2: [quietly] You're a therapist, right? I've seen your mail, doctor something-or-other. [sighs] This must be like bringing your work home in the worst possible way.

Character 1: [gently] Right now I'm just your neighbor who couldn't walk past someone in pain. [pause] The professional boundaries and ethical considerations are something I can navigate, but basic human compassion doesn't clock out at five.

Character 2: [very quietly] Would you sit with me for a few more minutes? [shaky voice] I'm not ready to go back to my apartment where everything looks exactly the same even though nothing is.

Character 1: [softly] Of course I'll sit with you. [pause] We can sit here as long as you need, in silence or talking, whatever feels right.

Character 2: [whispering] Thank you.
