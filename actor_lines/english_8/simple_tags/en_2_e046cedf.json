            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[boastful] When I built this company from nothing thirty years ago, I made sure to personally greet every single employee. [firmly] That's the difference between a billion-dollar empire and whatever mediocre operations our competitors run."

            "role": "Character 1",

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[dismissively] HR's approved messaging? [laughs] I think the person who signs everyone's paychecks gets to decide what the real company values are. [condescending] Move aside, I'll take it from here."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[passive-aggressive] Actually, the board specifically requested we follow the new standardized onboarding protocol they approved last quarter. [clearing throat] You were copied on that memo, along with the compliance requirements we need to meet."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[loudly] The board can request whatever they want. [stern] I'm standing right here, ready to inspire these people with the actual story of how we dominated three industries. [demanding] Unless you'd prefer to explain to them why they can't hear from their CEO?"

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[mocking] Legal disclosures and benefits enrollment—that's what you think wins hearts and minds? [very confidently] These people joined to be part of something legendary, not to fill out paperwork. [chuckles] That's why I'm worth eight hundred million and you're reading from a script."

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "You're absolutely right, Mr. Harrison—you should definitely tell them about winning. [sarcastically] Maybe start with how we won that harassment lawsuit last month, or the winning severance packages from last quarter's surprise layoffs?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[furious] Those situations were completely misrepresented by people who couldn't handle the pressure of excellence. [very loudly] Real leaders make tough decisions while specialists hide behind their little handbooks and protocols. [pause] You wouldn't understand."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[coldly] I understand that three of those twelve new hires are here specifically because their predecessors quit after your last impromptu orientation speech. [very quietly] But please, tell them about excellence while I document this for HR."

            "role": "Character 2",
