            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[empathetically] You're right, I don't understand that kind of loss. [very sincerely] But I do know what it's like to need space, to have everyone trying to fix you when all you want is to be left alone. [sighs]"

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[warm] People see someone quiet and assume something's broken that needs fixing. [hesitantly] They don't realize that solitude can be a choice, that some of us find our strength in the spaces between conversations, not during them."

            "role": "Character 2",

            "content": "I could bring you water and maybe some food, leave it nearby without getting close. [gently] This clearing is pretty remote—I only found it because I was trying to escape a family reunion, walking for hours to find somewhere truly quiet. [chuckles]"

            "content": "[passionately] Being alone isn't lonely when it's what restores you. [firmly] I'll keep your secret, bring what you need, and make sure no one else stumbles onto this place while you're healing."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[grateful] That's more understanding than I've encountered in seven years of flying over human territories. [quietly] You know what it means to guard your sanctuary, to protect the spaces where you can truly exist without performance."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[sincerely] We all need our kingdoms of solitude, whether they're in the sky or hidden clearings in the forest. [pause] I'll come back at dawn with water and fresh rabbit—there's a market that sells them whole for falconers."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[appreciative] You'd do that without trying to photograph me, without telling others about finding an injured hawk? [skeptical] Every human I've observed carries those little boxes that capture images."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[laughs] My phone's been dead for two days and honestly, it's been the best part of this whole trip. [confidently] Some moments are meant to be lived, not documented, not shared, just held quietly in memory where they keep their magic intact."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[moved] Perhaps I misjudged your species—or at least, I misjudged the quiet ones who walk alone. [warmly] You understand that healing happens best in shadows, away from the bright lights of attention and concern."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "The world needs its watchers, the ones who see from the edges rather than the center. [thoughtfully] Tomorrow at dawn then, and I'll whistle three times before entering the clearing so you know it's me, not a threat."
