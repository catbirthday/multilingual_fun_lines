Scenario: A smuggler arrives at a remote warehouse to retrieve hidden contraband, only to discover the property has just been sold to a new owner who's conducting a midnight inspection.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] Listen, I know this looks strange, me being here at two in the morning with a crowbar, but I can explain everything if you'll just give me a minute before calling the cops.

Character 2: [calmly] You're about thirty seconds too late for that threat to work—I already called them when I saw your truck pull up. [pause] Though I'm curious what explanation you think justifies breaking into my warehouse.

Character 1: Your warehouse? This place has been abandoned for three years, owned by some shell company in Delaware that never responded to any inquiries. [sighs] I had an arrangement with the previous management.

Character 2: Shell company went bankrupt last month, and I picked this place up at auction for basically nothing. [curious] What kind of arrangement involves crowbars and midnight visits to supposedly abandoned buildings?

Character 1: [hesitantly] I restore vintage motorcycles, and the previous owner let me store some rare parts here while I was between shops. [clearing throat] The crowbar was just to pry open the storage unit I've been renting.

Character 2: [skeptical] Vintage motorcycles. Right. And I suppose those shipping containers behind the false wall in Section C are full of carburetors and chrome bumpers?

Character 1: [quietly] You found those already? Most people don't notice that wall for months. [exhales] Look, whatever you think is in those containers, you're probably wrong, and definitely better off not knowing.

Character 2: [firmly] I spent fifteen years as a customs inspector before I retired early and started buying distressed properties. [chuckles] I know contraband architecture when I see it, and frankly, your setup here is impressive.

Character 1: [surprised] Customs inspector? Christ, of all the people to buy this place. [bitter] I suppose you're going to want to make some kind of citizen's arrest, collect a reward from whoever's looking for what's in there?

Character 2: [warmly] I retired because I got tired of ruining people's lives over arbitrary borders and regulations that change with every election. [pause] Whatever's in those containers has been here three years without hurting anyone, hasn't it?

Character 1: [confused] Are you saying you're willing to just let me take my property and leave? [anxiously] Because that sounds like either a trap or the kind of generosity that comes with a very expensive price tag attached.

Character 2: [modest] No trap, no price tag, just a practical solution to both our problems—you need your items gone, and I need plausible deniability when I renovate this place. [sincerely] But there's one condition.

Character 1: [resigned] Here it comes. You want a cut, information about my suppliers, maybe a new motorcycle for your retirement garage? [sighs] Everyone wants something in this business.

Character 2: [gently] I want you to teach me about those vintage motorcycles you mentioned—the lie was good because it had truth in it. [chuckles] I saw the '67 Triumph in your truck, restored beautifully.

Character 1: [stunned] You want motorcycle lessons? That's it? [laughs] You're either the strangest ex-customs officer I've ever met, or the best liar, and honestly, I'm not sure which possibility scares me more.

Character 2: [friendly] Maybe both, maybe neither—retirement gives you perspective on what actually matters in life. [warmly] So, do we have a deal? You clear out your containers this week, and Saturday mornings you teach me about British racing bikes?

Character 1: [relieved] Saturday mornings for motorcycle lessons in exchange for my freedom and my cargo. [exhales] You know what? After three years of looking over my shoulder, this might be the most honest deal I've ever made.

Character 2: Good.

Character 1: [warmly] I should probably cancel that police call I lied about earlier—never actually made it, seemed unnecessary for a midnight property inspection. [pause] Your truck's transmission sounds rough, by the way, might want to check that.

Character 2: [laughing] A smuggler giving me mechanical advice after I just gave them a free pass on three containers of contraband. [sighs] This is definitely the strangest Tuesday night I've had since retirement.
