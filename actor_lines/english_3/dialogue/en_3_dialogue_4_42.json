            "content": "Oh right, yeah, I heard about that whole mess. Erm, from what I understand, it was basically a complete breakdown in understanding local business etiquette, right? Like, our team showed up forty minutes late to the first meeting and, sheesh, that basically torpedoed the entire relationship before it even started."

This incident gives us leverage we didn't have before—I can pull together a proposal showing how much that contract was worth, probably around eight million, and suddenly fifty grand for proper training looks like pocket change."
