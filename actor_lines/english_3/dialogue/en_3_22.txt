Character 1: Did you report what happened in the loading dock yesterday?

Character 2: Oh god, well, you mean the forklift incident where, basically, Jerry almost got crushed because nobody, um, bothered to fix those broken safety sensors? Yeah, I filed three separate reports, and management's response was absolutely revolting.

Character 1: They're not, uh, going to fix it, you know, are they?

Character 2: They said it's not in the budget until next quarter, which is [regretful] disgusting considering someone could literally die. Meanwhile, they just renovated the executive break room with a sixty-thousand-dollar espresso machine.

Character 1: Sixty thousand? For coffee?

Character 2: I wish I was [joking] exaggerating, but no, it's this Italian monstrosity while we're walking around exposed asbestos in building C. The ceiling tiles are literally falling apart and releasing fibers into the air we breathe every single day.

Character 1: The asbestos thing is, er, actually illegal, I mean, isn't it?

Character 2: Completely illegal, and the mold situation in the basement storage area is even worse— black mold covering entire walls while they store our lunch supplies down there. It makes me physically sick thinking about what we're exposed to daily.

Character 1: Have you, like, contacted OSHA or, honestly, anyone outside the company?

Character 2: I called them last week, hmm, but [clearing throat] the wait time for an inspector is, you know, three to six months unless someone actually, well, dies first. The electrical panels without covers, the missing guardrails on the mezzanine, the chemical storage violations— it's absolutely repulsive how little they care.

Character 1: Three to six months? That's, uhh, basically a death sentence for, sort of, someone here.

Character 2: Yesterday I found out, actually, they've been hiding injury reports to keep their, er, insurance rates low— Tommy's hand got mangled last month and they, I mean, marked it as a minor first aid incident. The way they manipulate safety data while people suffer makes me want to vomit.

Character 1: Tommy needed surgery for that hand!

Character 2: Eight pins and two plates, but according to, well, our official records, he just needed a Band-Aid, which is, um, so morally repugnant I can't even process it. They're literally trading our bodies for profit margins, and HR just sits there nodding along like accomplices.

Character 1: What about the, anyway, union rep? Can't they, you know, do something?

Character 2: Our union rep got bought off with a promotion to supervisor last year, now he actively discourages safety complaints. The betrayal is nauseating, watching him tell injured workers to "tough it out" when he used to fight for us.

Character 1: This is completely insane.

Character 2: The scaffolding outside doesn't even have proper anchoring, just held up with zip ties and prayers while workers are forty feet up. Every time I walk under it, I feel this disgusting dread knowing it could collapse any second.

Character 1: Zip ties? Are you, uh, serious? That's, like, actually homicidal.

Character 2: Dead serious, and the most revolting part is they had a safety award ceremony last week, patting themselves on the back while we're one accident away from a mass casualty event. The sheer hypocrisy makes my stomach turn every time I think about it.
