Character 1: I don't want to talk [excited] about this anymore, can we just— can we change the subject?

Character 2: Oh wow, um, of course, I didn't realize— you know, sometimes I get carried away with these topics and, well, completely miss when someone's uncomfortable.

Character 1: It's not that, it's— I mean, my head's just, er, pounding and I can't... honestly, I can't focus on anything abstract right now.

Character 2: Hey hey, no worries at all, [over confidently] I totally get it— actually, when I'm stressed, abstract conversations are like, you know, trying to read through frosted glass, just impossible.

Character 1: Everything feels impossible right now. My chest is so tight.

Character 2: That sounds really rough. Do you want to just sit quietly for a minute? Sometimes that's all we need, just someone there without the pressure to perform or explain.

Character 1: I don't— umm, the thing is, sitting still makes it worse, like, everything speeds up and, er, crashes together in my head.

Character 2: Movement helps then? We could walk, or I could just ramble about something totally mundane while you pace— whatever feels right, no judgment here.

Character 1: Why are you being so nice? People usually just tell me to breathe or calm down.

Character 2: Because telling someone to calm down is, [delighted] honestly, the most useless advice ever— I mean, it's like telling someone who's drowning to, uhh, just swim better, you know?

Character 1: My hands won't [high-pitched] stop shaking— well, this is, uh, embarrassing, I barely know you and here I am, basically, falling apart.

Character 2: Listen, vulnerability isn't embarrassing, it's human. Plus, sometimes strangers are easier— no history, no expectations, just two people being real for a minute.

Character 1: I can't [very loudly] BREATHE properly! It's like someone's sitting on my chest!

Character 2: Okay, that's a panic response, totally normal even though it feels terrifying. Your body thinks there's a tiger but there's not— just your nervous system misfiring.

Character 1: There might as well be a tiger. Everything feels dangerous.

Character 2: I hear you, and that feeling is, [very quickly] um, so valid even though, actually, objectively nothing's attacking you right now— er, your brain just can't tell the difference between real and perceived threats.

Character 1: What if this never stops? What if I'm broken?

Character 2: You're not broken, you're overwhelmed, and those are completely different things. This will pass, it always does, even when it feels eternal in the moment.

Character 1: I just— hmm, I want to believe you but, you know, my body won't... it's just that everything feels wrong.

Character 2: That's okay, your body doesn't need to believe me right now. Just keep talking, keep moving, keep existing— sometimes that's the bravest thing we can do.
