Character 1: Oh wow, um, I was just thinking about this whole accounts receivable thing again, you know, and it's sort of become this incredible journey of discovery and human connection!

Character 2: That's definitely an optimistic way to frame what most people would consider the seventh circle of corporate hell, but I suppose someone needs to find joy in repeatedly asking people to pay their bills.

Character 1: No no no, well, hear me out here, I mean, it's basically like being a relationship counselor but for money and companies and payment terms!

Character 2: Er, that's actually a fascinating comparison, kind of makes me wonder if, the thing is, you're either a genius or completely delusional about what collections work really involves.

Character 1: Think about it though, uh, like every [pause] conversation is honestly this amazing opportunity to connect with someone new, to understand their challenges!

Character 2: Understanding their challenges is one thing, but at the end of the day we still need them to cut us a check, which is considerably less romantic than your vision of financial therapy sessions.

Character 1: But that's exactly why my approach works so beautifully!

Character 2: Hmm, I guess your approach does seem to be working, anyway, though I'm still not entirely convinced that treating collections like speed dating is a sustainable business model.

Character 1: Yesterday I spent forty-five minutes talking to the [yawn] accounts payable manager at Henderson Corp about her daughter's violin recital before even mentioning the invoice!

Character 2: So forty-five minutes of, uhh, personal conversation before even getting to business, it's just that I'm really wondering if that's efficient, though I suppose relationship building has its merits.

Character 1: And you know what, err, she actually [very melancholic] apologized for the delay, basically promised payment within three days because we'd become friends!

Character 2: Well, becoming friends with every client does sound nice, I mean, but sort of exhausting when you consider we have, honestly, hundreds of overdue accounts to manage every month.

Character 1: Um, but like, that's the beauty of it, right so, once you build that connection, kind of everything flows so much more smoothly!

Character 2: Ah, I see what you're saying, basically you're playing the long game here, I guess building relationships that, anyway, theoretically make future collections easier and more pleasant.

Character 1: Exactly! And uh, the thing is, people actually remember you, well, they actually look forward to your calls instead of screening them!

Character 2: Looking forward to collections calls is like looking forward to dental surgery, but I have to admit your success rate has been remarkably high lately.

Character 1: Hmm, we should totally do this together, you know, combine your analytical brilliance with my, er, sort of relationship-focused approach!

Character 2: That could be interesting, though I suspect my spreadsheets might dampen your enthusiasm for turning every invoice chase into a personal bonding experience.

Character 1: No way, your spreadsheets are [passionately] exactly what would make this perfect because then we'd have both the human touch and the hard data!

Character 2: Fine, we can try it your way, but if I end up discussing anyone's weekend plans for more than five minutes, I'm billing you for therapy services.
