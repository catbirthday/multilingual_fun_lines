Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about this whole thing with, you know, expense reports and honestly whether anyone actually checks them anymore.

Character 2: Oh that's a dangerous topic to bring up [playful] considering how many creative interpretations of "business dinner" I've seen come across my desk this month.

Character 1: Wait, I mean, are you saying people are like, actually fudging their receipts or, er, just being liberal with categories?

Character 2: Both, absolutely both, and the mental gymnastics people perform to justify a weekend trip to Vegas as "client relationship building" would win Olympic gold medals.

Character 1: But [loudly] everyone does it though, right?

Character 2: Well, that's the thing, you know, not everyone does it but, hmm, enough people do that it's become this sort of unspoken corporate tradition that nobody wants to fully address.

Character 1: Okay so, I guess what I'm really asking is, uh, where's the actual line between, basically, acceptable and fraudulent?

Character 2: The line is, er, technically very clear in policy but, anyway, in practice it's about as blurry as, uhh, a watercolor painting left out in the rain.

Character 1: Right so, yesterday my manager, um, told me to just, the thing is, classify my Uber rides home as, actually, client entertainment.

Character 2: Your manager explicitly told you to misclassify personal transportation as client entertainment, which sounds like they're either joking or actively encouraging expense fraud.

Character 1: No no, I mean, she was [gasp softly] totally serious and said, you know, everyone at her level does it, honestly.

Character 2: Ah, the classic "everyone at my level" defense which, basically, translates to "I've been doing this so long that, well, I've convinced myself it's somehow justified."

Character 1: Should I report this?

Character 2: That's a tough one because, [cough], reporting it could, err, protect you legally but, it's just that, it might also make you persona non grata in the office.

Character 1: Yeah, um, I keep thinking about [trailing off] whether standing up for ethics is worth, sort of, potentially torpedoing my career here...

Character 2: Standing up for ethics shouldn't torpedo anything in a healthy company, but, hmm, we both know that's not, anyway, how office politics actually work in reality.

Character 1: So basically I'm stuck between, uhh, compromising my integrity or, I guess, becoming the office pariah who, well, nobody trusts anymore?

Character 2: Document everything in writing, keep copies of any instructions to falsify expenses, and maybe start casually looking for other opportunities where ethics aren't treated as optional.

Character 1: God, this is so, er, frustrating because I actually, you know, really liked this job until, honestly, all this shadiness started surfacing.

Character 2: The shadiness was probably always there, you're just seeing it now because you're paying attention, which honestly makes you more ethically aware than ninety percent of corporate America.
