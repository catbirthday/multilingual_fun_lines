Character 1: I need to know exactly how Tesla crushed their competition. I want that kind of dominance for myself.

Character 2: Tesla's strategy was fascinating—they started at the luxury end with the Roadster and Model S, then worked their way down-market. Most automakers like Ford or GM were stuck defending their existing combustion engine business, which gave Tesla this massive first-mover advantage in EVs.

Character 1: But how do I personally benefit from knowing that?

Character 2: [slowly] Well, the principle applies everywhere. Amazon did the same thing with AWS—they built infrastructure for themselves, then monetized it as a service. Netflix destroyed Blockbuster by embracing streaming while Blockbuster clung to physical stores.

Character 1: [flirtatious] You're pretty smart. Want to be my personal strategy consultant?

Character 2: [enunciating every word] That's not really how this works. But look at what Peter Thiel says in Zero to One—competition is for losers. PayPal didn't compete with banks directly; they created a new category entirely.

Character 1: I don't care about categories. I want to destroy my competitors at Johnson & Associates.

Character 2: Classic mistake. Sun Tzu would tell you that direct confrontation is the worst strategy. Look at how Apple never mentions Samsung in ads, but Samsung constantly references Apple—it just reinforces Apple's position as the leader.

Character 1: [happy] Now we're talking! So I should act like I'm already winning?

Character 2: Exactly. Microsoft under Satya Nadella stopped fighting Google directly in search and pivoted to cloud services with Azure. They're now worth more than Alphabet because they picked battles they could actually win.

Character 1: [friendly] Help me apply this to my situation specifically then.

Character 2: You need to find your Blue Ocean, as Kim and Mauborgne would say. Cirque du Soleil didn't compete with Ringling Brothers on their terms—they created a completely new circus experience that commanded premium prices.

Character 1: But I want their clients. I want their revenue. I want everything they have.

Character 2: That's exactly what killed Quibi—Jeffrey Katzenberg thought he could just take market share from Netflix and YouTube. Instead of finding unmet needs, he tried to force his way into an occupied space and burned through 1.75 billion dollars.

Character 1: [very sincerely] I just really need to win this time. My whole reputation depends on it.

Character 2: Then study how Spotify beat Apple Music despite Apple having infinite resources. They focused relentlessly on personalization algorithms and social features while Apple relied on their ecosystem lock-in. Spotify won by being better at the one thing that mattered most.

Character 1: What if I just poach their best people?

Character 2: That's what Uber tried with Carnegie Mellon's robotics department, and it backfired spectacularly. Google's approach with DeepMind was smarter—they acquired the whole team and kept them autonomous, preserving the culture that made them successful.

Character 1: Fine. What's the most ruthless legal strategy you know?

Character 2: Intel in the 90s with their "Intel Inside" campaign—they went straight to consumers, bypassing computer manufacturers entirely. Suddenly Dell, HP, and Compaq had no choice but to use Intel chips because that's what customers demanded. Complete market control through brand dominance.
