            "content": "Okay so, pretty bad actually. A lot of IoT devices ship with default passwords that people never change, or they have, like, zero encryption on the data they transmit. Researchers have found baby monitors that anyone could access if they knew the IP address."

            "content": "Yeah, it's genuinely scary stuff. And the thing is, once you connect something to your network, it becomes a potential entry point for hackers to get into, you know, everything else you have connected. Your whole digital life basically becomes vulnerable through your smart lightbulb."

            "content": "[sniffle] Well, I mean, smart lights are actually one of the less risky ones if you stick with reputable brands. The real problems are with, um, cheap knockoffs and devices that require constant cloud connections to function. At least lights can work locally on your network."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "So, it depends on the system you got. Some work entirely locally through Bluetooth or, like, a local hub, but others route everything through company servers so you can control them from anywhere. That remote access is convenient but it means your usage patterns are probably being collected and analyzed somewhere."

            "content": "Honestly, that's not a terrible instinct. The convenience is nice but, uh, you're definitely trading privacy and security for it. Every smart device is essentially a tiny computer that most people never update, and manufacturers often abandon support after a couple years."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[shouting] Basically yes! And the worst part is there's no real regulation forcing companies to maintain security updates or even tell you when support ends! You could have devices running for years with known vulnerabilities that will never, ever get patched!"

            "content": "Look, you don't have to go full luddite or anything. Just, you know, be selective about what you connect, use strong unique passwords, keep things updated when possible, and maybe put your IoT devices on a separate network from your computers and phones if your router supports it."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Yeah, I know, it's genuinely ridiculous that we've turned simple appliances into security liabilities. The whole IoT industry kind of put the cart before the horse, rushing products to market without thinking through the long-term implications of having billions of poorly secured devices connected to the internet."
