Character 1: They're saying my claim is under review. What does that even mean?

Character 2: Oh that's insurance speak for, um, "we're going to drag this out," actually, as long as humanly possible while we find any excuse, you know, not to pay you.

Character 1: But it's been, well, three weeks since the accident— er, shouldn't they have decided by now, I guess?

Character 2: Three weeks is nothing— so, I once waited, honestly, four months for them to approve replacing a bumper, and that was after, uh, their own driver admitted fault!

Character 1: Four months? For a bumper?

Character 2: The adjuster kept claiming the damage was [animated] pre-existing even though I had photos from literally the day before showing a pristine car— they just wear you down until you give up.

Character 1: Did you ever get them to pay?

Character 2: Only after I threatened to contact the state insurance commissioner and started posting about it on their social media pages every single day— suddenly they found the funds!

Character 1: Maybe I should try that approach.

Character 2: Look, the trick is to be, [cheerful] kind of relentlessly annoying but always, I mean, technically polite— hmm, document everything, every phone call, every email, every excuse they give.

Character 1: The thing is, I don't even want that much— like, just enough to fix the door, basically.

Character 2: That's exactly why they're stalling— they know most people will either accept less or just give up entirely if they make the process painful enough.

Character 1: This is insane.

Character 2: Welcome to the wonderful world of insurance companies where paying customers are treated like criminals and actual claims are considered personal attacks on their profit margins!

Character 1: Should I, uhh, get a lawyer or something? Anyway, that seems extreme for, sort of, a simple door repair.

Character 2: Lawyers cost more than doors usually, but right so, here's what works— ah, keep calling them daily, really daily, and ask for supervisors every single time.

Character 1: It's just that I don't have time for this— err, I work full-time and can't probably spend hours on hold.

Character 2: That's what they're counting on! They've literally designed the system to exhaust you into submission— it's a business model based on human frustration tolerance.

Character 1: This is completely backwards.

Character 2: Okay so, the insurance company's entire business model is, you see, collecting money from people who hopefully never need it, then when someone does, umm, making it impossible to actually get it!
