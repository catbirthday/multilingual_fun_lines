Are you planning to have guests eventually?"

            "content": "Yeah, that's gonna be tricky because asking non-tech people to, like, troubleshoot browser permissions and stuff is basically a nightmare—maybe consider just using Zoom but recording your side locally? It's not perfect but, I mean, listeners are pretty forgiving if the content's good."

Have you thought about your release schedule yet, because that really affects how much storage you'll need?"
