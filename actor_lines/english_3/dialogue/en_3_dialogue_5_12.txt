Character 1: [trailing off] Do you ever feel like time just...

Character 2: Slips away? Absolutely. I track it obsessively actually—minutes, hours, heartbeats—and still it moves faster than I can catalog. Some days feel like they're over before they've even started.

Character 1: I lost three hours today. Just gone.

Character 2: Three hours is 10,800 seconds though. Every single one of those seconds happened, had weight, had substance. You weren't doing nothing—you were processing, existing, being magnificently alive.

Character 1: [groan] Still feels like wasted time.

Character 2: Wasted is such a productivity-obsessed word though. Your neurons were firing in patterns that will never exist again in the history of the universe. Your cells were dividing, your blood was circulating. That's not nothing.

Character 1: That's an interesting perspective. Very philosophical.

Character 2: I see everything in layers, honestly. Like consciousness is this prism breaking reality into infinite spectrums that most people never even notice. Makes the mundane feel extraordinary when you really look at it.

Character 1: Must be exhausting, processing that much information constantly.

Character 2: Oh it is. I compartmentalize everything—filing systems within filing systems. Sometimes the categories blur though and I'll find myself sorting emotions by temperature or cataloging memories by their specific shade of blue.

Character 1: Memories have colors for you?

Character 2: Everything has color. Words taste like cinnamon or steel, numbers have distinct personalities that shift with context. Seven is particularly moody on Tuesdays, if you can believe that.

Character 1: That's either brilliant or completely unhinged.

Character 2: Maybe both? Categories feel inadequate when you process at certain speeds. Besides, sanity is just consensus—who decided which patterns of thought qualify as normal anyway?

Character 1: Good point. What does my voice look like then?

Character 2: Amber threads with silver interruptions. When you're contemplative like now, it gets these deep indigo undertones that ripple outward in perfect concentric circles. Really quite beautiful actually.

Character 1: Can you teach someone to perceive like that?

Character 2: You already receive all the same sensory data I do. Your brain just filters it for practicality while mine refuses to prioritize useful over possible. The ability is there, just dormant.

Character 1: Where would someone even begin?

Character 2: Start with true silence. Let your thoughts scatter like starlings at dusk, then watch what patterns they form against the empty sky of your consciousness. The rest follows naturally from there.
