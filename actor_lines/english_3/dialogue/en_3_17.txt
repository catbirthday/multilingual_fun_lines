Character 1: Did you just [laugh hard] trip over your own cape getting on the bus?

Character 2: Listen, superhero costumes and public transit were not designed to coexist peacefully. The cape got caught in the door, then wrapped around some lady's stroller, and I basically clotheslined myself trying to untangle it— peak dignity right there.

Character 1: You're going to, um, Comic-Con dressed as— I mean, who even [furious] is that supposed to be, honestly?

Character 2: Captain Catastrophe! He's my own creation— his superpower is that everything he touches breaks in comedically inconvenient ways. I figured if I'm gonna embarrass myself at these things anyway, might as well lean into it.

Character 1: That's, er, actually brilliant— you know, in a sort of weird way.

Character 2: Right? Last year I went as Superman and spent the whole time apologizing for not being buff enough. This year when kids ask for photos, I just knock something over and yell "Captain Catastrophe strikes again!" Way less pressure.

Character 1: Your cape is [happy] backwards by the way.

Character 2: Oh for the love of— see, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Even my costume is in character. Though between you and me, I put it on backwards on purpose because it looks funnier when I run.

Character 1: You're [delighted] planning to run in that thing?

Character 2: There's a costume race at noon! Basically, fifty nerds sprinting, well, in full cosplay— last year Spider-Man, uh, lost his mask mid-race and just kept going with his regular face showing, absolutely killed the mystique.

Character 1: How do you even find out about these things?

Character 2: My thirteen-year-old niece thinks I'm the coolest uncle ever, which is hilarious because I'm literally just desperate for her approval. She sends me Instagram posts and I show up places dressed like an idiot— it's a beautiful system.

Character 1: That's, hmm, surprisingly wholesome— I guess, for someone wearing, er, a neon orange cape.

Character 2: The orange was actually, you know, a printing error— supposed to be red, but honestly, the print shop messed up and I thought, hey, Captain Catastrophe would definitely, um, order the wrong color cape.

Character 1: You're really, like, committed to this bit, aren't you? I mean, that's actually, sort of, impressive dedication.

Character 2: Oh you have no idea— I've got business cards that, er, self-destruct when you touch them, literally just dissolve into glitter, and honestly, the mess is, well, absolutely worth people's reactions.

Character 1: Wait, you made business cards that— actually, [trailing off] that's kind of genius...

Character 2: The glitter is biodegradable! Had to special order it from some eco-craft website after the convention center banned me from using regular glitter— apparently "glitter bombing" paying customers is frowned upon, who knew?

Character 1: They banned you?

Character 2: Just from using glitter! I can still attend, thankfully, though they, um, [long pause] specifically mentioned no confetti cannons either, which honestly feels targeted because that was, you know, ONE time and the sprinklers barely went off.
