            "content": "[very sincerely] Oh! Yeah no, it's actually, um, it's one of those concepts that sounds way more complicated than it really is. Basically you're building websites that work for everyone first, then, uh, layering on the fancy stuff for browsers that can handle it."

            "content": "[very sincerely] Erm, no I haven't but—hey, weren't we just talking about progressive enhancement? I mean, I'm happy to chat about Netflix but, like, you seemed really confused about the web development stuff just now?"

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Progressive enhancement—it's basically, mm, building from the ground up. You start with HTML that works everywhere, then you add CSS for styling, and finally JavaScript for, you know, the interactive bits. Everything builds on what came before."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Well, I mean, React is great and all but it's, uh, kind of the opposite approach. With React you're basically requiring JavaScript for anything to work at all, which means if it fails or someone's on a slow connection, they get, like, nothing."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[speeding up] Uh right so forms are actually perfect for this—your basic HTML form submits to a server without any JavaScript at all then you can enhance it with validation auto-save real-time feedback all that good stuff but the core functionality just works!"

            "content": "I mean, it's pretty fundamental if you're, uh, building anything on the web. But honestly, if you're not feeling it right now, that's okay—sometimes these concepts click better when you actually need them for something specific, you know?"

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Woof, okay, er, speed round: HTML first, always functional, CSS makes it pretty, JavaScript makes it fancy. Think of it like, mm, building a house—foundation, walls, then decoration. Every layer enhances but doesn't replace what's underneath."
        },

            "content": "Sure, I guess, though I literally just said I haven't seen it, so, uh, I'm not sure how much I can contribute here. But hey, if you want to tell me about it while simultaneously forgetting everything we just discussed, I'm, like, weirdly used to this now."
