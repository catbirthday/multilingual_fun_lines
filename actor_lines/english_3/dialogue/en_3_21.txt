Character 1: Is this your first time volunteering at the tournament?

Character 2: Actually no, I've been doing this for three years now, though watching these pros nail shots I can [jealous] barely dream of still gets me every time. Alright, we're starting at hole seven, par four, 385 yards to the pin.

Character 1: Three years? That's [crying while speaking] dedication right there.

Character 2: The community here is incredible, and honestly helping anxious players stay focused is really rewarding. Next group coming through scored birdie, eagle, par on the last three holes.

Character 1: Do you, um, actually play golf yourself or just, you know, volunteer?

Character 2: I play every weekend when I'm not here, though my handicap is, well, embarrassing compared to these folks— sitting at about eighteen, honestly. Current leader is negative four through six holes.

Character 1: Eighteen isn't, er, that bad, I mean, for recreational play, right?

Character 2: You're sweet to say that, but, actually, when you're standing here calling out that someone just hit 287 yards straight down the fairway while you, basically, struggle to break 200, it's pretty humbling.

Character 1: Must be, like, tough watching them [jealous] make it look so, uhh, effortless.

Character 2: The way they read greens is almost supernatural— this morning's group averaged 1.3 putts per hole. But hey, being here helps me learn just by observing their technique and mental approach.

Character 1: What's the, hmm, most impressive shot you've seen today, I guess?

Character 2: Oh, someone just chipped in from [sneeze] forty-two yards for eagle on hole five, and, you know, the crowd went absolutely wild— sounded like, actually, the Super Bowl for a minute there.

Character 1: Forty-two yards? That's, well, basically lottery odds, isn't it?

Character 2: For us mortals, absolutely, but these players practice that exact distance probably thousand times a month. Wind speed currently at eight miles per hour from the southwest, by the way.

Character 1: How do you, sort of, keep track of all these numbers while, er, also talking to people?

Character 2: Years of practice and a really good notepad, though [bored] sometimes when it's the fifteenth group through the same hole, the numbers start blending together. Current pin position is back left, seventeen feet from the edge.

Character 1: Do the players ever, you know, get frustrated with all the, uhh, statistical announcements?

Character 2: Most appreciate it because it helps with club selection, but, well, occasionally you get someone who thinks we're jinxing them— especially after I announce, kind of, their playing partner just went three under.

Character 1: Three under? That's [short pause] some serious pressure.

Character 2: Temperature's dropped to 72 degrees which, honestly, is perfect golf weather, and the thing is, watching someone overcome that pressure to sink a twelve-footer for birdie, I mean, that's why I keep coming back here.
