=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Oh wow, um, my roommate just told me she's moving out next month! This is actually such a crazy opportunity!

Character 2: Oh god, that's the worst feeling in the world. I remember when my roommate did that to me, left me completely stranded with double rent and this crushing sense of betrayal.

Character 1: No no, so this could be amazing! You know, I've been wanting to redecorate forever!

Character 2: Well, I mean, sure, redecorating sounds fun until you're basically scrambling to find someone who won't destroy your newly decorated space within a week.

Character 1: True, but like, think about all the possibilities! I could honestly find someone who shares my interests, er, maybe even becomes a best friend!

Character 2: Oh uhh, finding a decent roommate is sort of [sarcastic] super easy these days, anyway, everyone's totally normal with no bizarre habits or red flags whatsoever.

Character 1: You're being negative! This could be the best thing that ever happened to me!

Character 2: Look, I've been through seven roommates in five years, and each one started with optimism and ended with me changing the locks and deep cleaning mysterious stains.

Character 1: But imagine all the new people I'll meet during interviews! It'll be like speed dating but for friendship!

Character 2: The thing is, hmm, those interviews are torture—people lie about everything, actually, from their cleanliness habits to whether they have secret pet ferrets they're hiding.

Character 1: Oh, I could really [excited] turn this into a whole adventure! Kind of like a reality show casting call!

Character 2: A reality show? I guess that's one way to frame it, uh, though honestly most reality shows end in tears and lawsuits if we're being realistic here.

Character 1: Maybe I'll make a fun questionnaire! With personality tests and everything!

Character 2: Questionnaires are great until someone seems perfect on paper, well, then you know [pause] they move in and suddenly they're practicing bagpipes at 3am, basically every night.

Character 1: Come on, so what are the odds of that? I mean, this city is full of amazing people, actually!

Character 2: The odds are higher than you think. This city is full of people pretending to be normal while harboring deeply concerning habits that only emerge after signing a lease.

Character 1: You know what, um, I'm going to embrace this! Like, every experience teaches us something, anyway!

Character 2: Absolutely.

Character 1: See! Even you agree! I'm honestly going to, err, start posting ads tonight and well, see what happens!

Character 2: I wasn't agreeing, I was surrendering to your relentless optimism, but sure, go ahead and learn these lessons the hard way like the rest of us did.
