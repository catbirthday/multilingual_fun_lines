Character 1: So, um, the bill's $247.83 and there's basically twelve of us. Who's got a calculator?

Character 2: Oh perfect, nothing says [frustrated] friendship like dividing an odd number by twelve people who ordered wildly different things— should we just split evenly and pretend Derek didn't order three appetizers?

Character 1: Well, Derek also got the lobster. You know, the sixty dollar lobster.

Character 2: Right, er, so Derek's basically looking at about ninety bucks honestly, while Sarah had a salad and water— this is why restaurants should just give everyone separate checks automatically.

Character 1: Can we Venmo? Or is this a cash situation?

Character 2: Half the table uses Venmo, three people only have Zelle, and grandpa brought exact change in coins— this is going to take longer than the actual meal did.

Character 1: Wait, uh, who ordered the wine? I mean, that's another forty right there.

Character 2: That was birthday girl's "gift" apparently, which means we're all splitting it except nobody told Marcus who doesn't drink— he's already doing the angry nostril flare thing.

Character 1: Like, should we just throw credit cards in and sort of pray?

Character 2: Credit card roulette! Except last time we did that, the server accidentally charged everything to one card and poor Jennifer's account got frozen for suspicious activity.

Character 1: Hmm, didn't someone not tip last time? The thing is, I always overtip to compensate.

Character 2: That was Brad, who insists ten percent is generous because "back in his day"— meanwhile our server is literally standing there watching us argue about quarters.

Character 1: So, what if we actually just split evenly and call it a day?

Character 2: Sure, let's penalize the vegetarians and reward the carnivores— Emma's already pulling up her itemized spreadsheet with color-coded cells for shared appetizers.

Character 1: Emma has a spreadsheet? That's [trailing off] actually kind of brilliant...

Character 2: She's [extremely happy] got formulas for tax distribution and everything— last month she invoiced us all with payment terms and a late fee structure!

Character 1: Anyway, how much do I owe? I guess I had the pasta and one beer.

Character 2: Twenty-three fifty for food, your beer's five, tax brings you to thirty-one, and if we're doing twenty percent tip— congratulations, you owe exactly thirty-seven dollars!

Character 1: Perfect! Uhh, except I only have two twenties. Can anyone kind of break a twenty?

Character 2: And here we go with the change-making chain reaction— by the time this is over, we'll all somehow owe each other money and the restaurant will have closed for the night.
