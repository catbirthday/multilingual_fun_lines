Character 1: Is that your drone making all that noise outside?

Character 2: Yeah, sorry about that— I'm calibrating the new gimbal system for a real estate shoot tomorrow. These commercial drones sound like angry wasps when you're doing precision adjustments, but it should only take another few minutes.

Character 1: How'd you get into flying drones professionally?

Character 2: Well, I started with, um, photography actually, then realized I could, [chuckle], charge three times as much if, you know, I added aerial shots to the package.

Character 1: That's, er, pretty smart— I mean, like, the business angle of it, anyway.

Character 2: The learning curve was brutal though— crashed my first drone into a client's chimney on day two. Insurance saved me, but watching five thousand dollars fall off a roof in pieces really makes you question your life choices.

Character 1: Five thousand? For one drone?

Character 2: So, the professional ones are, [bored], basically flying computers— you know, dual cameras, obstacle avoidance, actually, forty-five minute flight times, thermal imaging if you need it.

Character 1: What's the weirdest job you've taken?

Character 2: This guy wanted me to follow his ex-girlfriend's [angry] wedding procession from above— absolutely not! I don't do surveillance, stalking, or anything that would make me explain myself to a judge, period.

Character 1: People actually ask for that?

Character 2: Oh, you'd be surprised— I get, well, [friendly], all kinds of requests, honestly, from people wanting to spy on neighbors to, um, checking if their spouse is really at work.

Character 1: That's, hmm, really creepy— I guess, like, people don't realize there are, er, laws about this stuff?

Character 2: Most people think if, you know, it's in the air it's fair game, but actually, there are, uh, strict regulations about privacy, airspace, and basically, where you can fly.

Character 1: So, um, what do you, I mean, mostly film then— like, what's the, er, bread and butter work?

Character 2: Real estate pays the bills, honestly— realtors want, well, those sweeping shots that, you know, make a two-bedroom ranch look like, um, a countryside estate.

Character 1: Do you ever [cough] lose drones during shoots?

Character 2: Lost one to a hawk last month— thing just swooped down and knocked it clean out of the sky. The footage of the attack was incredible though, right up until the camera cut out.

Character 1: Wait, seriously? That's, uh, kind of terrifying— I mean, for the drone, er, obviously.

Character 2: Right? The hawk probably thought it was defending territory from some weird mechanical bird— can't really blame it, though my wallet definitely disagreed with that philosophical position.
