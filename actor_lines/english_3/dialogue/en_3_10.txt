Character 1: Did you see that video of the guy who built a tiny house in his parents' backyard?

Character 2: Yeah, the one with the spiral staircase? Pretty clever use of space, though I wonder how his parents feel about having a permanent houseguest twenty feet from their kitchen window.

Character 1: I was thinking, um, maybe I could [overly polite] build something, you know, similar but actually, smaller.

Character 2: Smaller than tiny? So like, what, a shed with a hot plate, basically? I mean, at that point you might as well just live in your car.

Character 1: My car doesn't have a composting toilet though.

Character 2: Fair point. But seriously, where would you even put it? Most cities have minimum square footage requirements for dwellings.

Character 1: My uncle has some land upstate.

Character 2: That changes things. Rural zoning is way more flexible, plus you'd have space for solar panels and maybe even a little garden.

Character 1: The the thing is, uh, I don't [stuttering] know how to b-build anything, honestly.

Character 2: There are [enunciating every word] actually tons of prefab kits now. Some company delivers all the pieces and you just assemble it like expensive IKEA furniture, takes maybe a weekend with help.

Character 1: How much does something like that cost?

Character 2: Well, you're looking at, [deep pitch] er, anywhere from fifteen to fifty thousand, the thing is, it depends on how fancy you want to get. Basic shell versus full electrical and plumbing makes a huge difference.

Character 1: That's more than I expected.

Character 2: Yeah, tiny doesn't mean cheap unfortunately. But compared to regular housing prices it's still a bargain, especially if you can avoid taking out a mortgage.

Character 1: True. No thirty-year loan hanging over my head.

Character 2: Exactly, and honestly, you could probably, hmm, do it for less if you source materials yourself, you know? Craigslist has free windows and doors all the time from renovations.

Character 1: I'm so, [exhausted] uhh, tired of paying rent anyway, it's just that, finding another option feels impossible sometimes.

Character 2: Right so, why not actually start small, I mean really small, like maybe a shed office first? You could practice the basics without committing to living in it.

Character 1: That's not a bad idea.

Character 2: Plus, well, if it turns out terrible, you know, at least you've only built a terrible shed, basically, not a terrible house. Lower stakes for your first construction project.
