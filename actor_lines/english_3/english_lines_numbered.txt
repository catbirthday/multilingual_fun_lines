# Speaker Lines Only (English)
============================================================

1. Hey there, um, let me just, uh, pull that up for you real quick. Can you give me your, er, claim number or maybe your employee ID?
2. Got it, so that's EMP-4421, and I'm seeing claim CLM-9983-BV here about, um, vehicle damage at the Marriott location? Listen, I actually, uh, used to work valet myself back in college, so I totally get how nerve-wracking these things can be.
3. Yeah yeah, um, three years at a hotel downtown actually. So looking at your file here, REF-2287-QM shows the, uh, damage report was filed at 2:47 PM yesterday?
4. Okay so, um, here's what we're gonna do. I can see in the system that you've got, uh, no prior incidents under account ACC-4421-VA, which is really good. Did you, um, happen to take any photos before you parked it?
5. Right right, um, I remember that. Look, between you and me? The fact that your record's clean under EMP-4421 means, uh, a lot here. I'm gonna flag this for manual review.
6. No no no, we're not letting that happen. So I'm putting in override code OVR-5501-TK right now, and um, I'm also adding a note that the customer has, uh, a history of pre-existing damage claims—found three others on this vehicle in our database.
7. Yep. VIN ending in 3847 shows, um, two previous scratch claims, codes CLM-7734-RD and CLM-8890-PL, both marked as, uh, pre-existing damage. So this is kind of becoming a pattern with this customer.
8. You're gonna be fine. Trust me. Um, I'm escalating this right now to review team two, case number ESC-1122-MN, and they're usually, uh, pretty understanding about these situations.
9. So typically it's, um, 24 to 48 hours, but I'm marking it priority under code PRI-9903-XX because, uh, I can see you need this resolved for payroll. Actually, you know what? I'm gonna give you my direct extension too.
10. Absolutely. Extension 4477. Um, call me tomorrow afternoon and I'll, uh, personally check where we're at with case ESC-1122-MN. We're gonna get this sorted, I promise.
11. Oh yeah, the verification system's been a real pain lately—let me pull up your account real quick with your customer ID CST-4829-JX91, and I'll be straight with you about what's going wrong.
12. So basically, um, nine times out of ten with verification code VRF-88201-K, it's actually, uh, the system rejecting perfectly good photos because, like, it's ridiculously picky about lighting.
13. No no no, you're not stupid at all—this thing rejects my own photo half the time when I test it, and your attempt logs here under session SES-7749-MN22 show you've done everything right.
14. Right right.
15. So here's what we're gonna do—I'm setting up a manual override with ticket TKT-3901-WZ88, which honestly should've been done after your third failed attempt because this automated system is garbage sometimes.
16. Hey, um, don't apologize, seriously—you're like the fifth person today with this exact issue, and, uh, between you and me? Corporate knows the system's broken but won't spring for the fix.
17. Got it approved.
18. Yep, just pushed through authorization code AUTH-5542-LP31, and honestly it's stupid we make people jump through these hoops when I can literally fix it in thirty seconds like this.
19. No way, calling was the right move—your verification attempts under reference REF-6623-QD show you tried eight times, which is way more patient than I'd be with this junky system.
20. So basically your access token ACC-9984-TK02 is fully active right now, um, and like, you should be good to go—but honestly if it gives you any trouble, just call back and ask for me, I'll make sure it sticks.
21. Oh, um, yes, hello! So I'm—I'm really sorry to hear that, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, um, can I get your account number or, er, the phone number associated with the account so I can, you know, take a look at what might have happened there?
22. Perfect, um, thank you so much, so that's pulling up account AC-7739-NM21 and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that there was a, um, a change made on October 15th and—oh, oh gosh, I'm really sorry about this—it looks like your premium plan was, uh, switched to our basic tier.
23. No no, you're absolutely right to be confused, and I'm so sorry this happened—looking at the notes here on ticket TKT-49182-B, it seems there was an automatic system adjustment due to a payment processing error last month, but this definitely should have been communicated better to you.
24. Oh gosh, I completely understand, and please don't apologize—let me check the payment history on your account, just one moment... okay so transaction TRX-8847291 from September did initially fail but then it went through successfully two days later, which should have prevented any service changes.
25. No no no, please, you're—you're being so understanding and I really, um, I really appreciate that, but this is, uh, this is definitely our mistake and I'm going to, um, let me see what I can do here to fix this immediately, okay? Your confirmation number for this call is CNF-772-894-XK and I'm—I'm putting in a priority request right now.
26. I know, I know, and um, I'm really, really sorry you're dealing with this—so I've submitted the restoration request RES-66429-QT and, uh, normally this takes 24-48 hours but I'm, um, I'm marking it as urgent because this was completely our error, so you should see your premium features back within, er, probably 2-3 hours maximum.
27. Oh, um, no, definitely not days! Since this was, uh, our system error and not a, you know, a billing issue or anything, I can—I can fast-track it using override code OVR-5521-K, and actually, um, let me also add a service credit to your account for the inconvenience.
28. That's, um, that's really kind of you to say but honestly, this is—this is the least I can do, so I'm applying a, uh, a $50 credit under reference CRD-9944-TZ88, and it'll show on your next statement, and um, again, I'm just so sorry about all of this.
29. Please, you have nothing to apologize for—you've been incredibly patient and understanding through this whole mess that we created, and I've documented everything in case notes CN-445821 so if there are any other issues, any representative can see exactly what happened and help immediately.
30. Of course, of course, and um, thank you for your patience today—your service should be fully restored shortly and you'll get an email confirmation to the address on file with tracking number TRK-8829-MNQ41, and, uh, please don't hesitate to call back if you need anything else at all, okay?
31. Oh yes, absolutely, um, let me just... hmm, pull up our settlement database here. So you received a notice in the mail, and, uh, you're wondering what it's about and, er, what you need to do with it?
32. Oh no no, don't apologize at all! This is, um, actually really important and I'm glad you called. Let me see here... do you happen to have that notice with you? There should be a, uh, case number at the top, something like CAS followed by some numbers?
33. Perfect, thank you so much. Okay so, um, pulling that up now... CAS-4492-BNX, and... hmm, alright, so this is for the, uh, data breach settlement from last year. Basically what happened was, er, some customer information was compromised and now there's compensation available.
34. Right right, exactly.
35. So, um, it's actually pretty straightforward, and I want you to know, like, this is legitimate, not a scam or anything. You can file your claim online using that, uh, case number I mentioned, CAS-4492-BNX, or, hmm, you can mail in the form that came with the notice. The deadline is, let me check... March fifteenth.
36. Yes, exactly, so you've got, um, a little over five weeks. And honestly? Between you and me, I actually had to file one of these myself last year for a different company, and, uh, the online way took maybe ten minutes?
37. Oh absolutely! Yeah, I was, er, just as confused when I got mine. But the website for yours is, um, let me make sure I have this right... it's settlement-4492-BNX.com, and you'll need your claim ID which should be, uh, right under that case number on your notice?
38. Perfect, that's it.
39. Oh, I completely understand, and, um, honestly that's one of the most common complaints we hear. These notices are, er, written by lawyers and they're not exactly, hmm, user-friendly? But basically with your claim ID, CLM-88291-MK, you just enter that on the website, answer a few questions about, uh, whether you were affected, and then choose if you want a check or a credit.
40. Absolutely, yeah, you can, um, decide when you're filling it out. And just so you know, the average payout for this one is, er, between seventy-five and a hundred-fifty dollars, depending on... hmm, how long you were a customer and, uh, what information was involved. Is there anything else about the settlement I can help clarify?
41. Oh! Um, okay so, let me just, uh... pull up your account here and—oh wow, yeah, I can definitely help with that! So basically, um, I just need your account number, or if you have like a... what's the word... a reference number from any recent statement?
42. Perfect! So ACC-7829-J, got it, and um, oh wow, I'm seeing... hmm, there's quite a few charges here from, uh, let me see... looks like transaction IDs starting with TXN-9847 through TXN-9863, all from the past week, and these are showing... wait, these are from completely different zones than your usual route pattern that I can see here in the system...
43. No no, you're absolutely right to be upset! Um, so what I'm seeing here is, uh... hmm, it's like a... what do they call it... a transponder echo? Where basically, um, your device ID DVC-4419-NK is somehow getting picked up by gates you're not even going through, which honestly? Yeah, that's ridiculous.
44. I mean... yeah. That's, um, that's exactly what it looks like, and between you and me? This happens way more than it should. So let me just, uh, start a dispute for all these—
45. Well, um, so it's been a... hmm, known issue? For like, uh, maybe three months now? And they keep saying they'll fix it but... anyway, I'm putting through refund request RFD-5571-QM right now for the full sixty dollars, and um, I'm also gonna add a note about getting you a replacement transponder.
46. Yeah, I know. It's... look, um, I'm new here but even I think it's, uh, pretty bad. So what I'm doing is, er, I'm expediting this whole thing under case number CSE-8829-RT, and honestly? I'm gonna flag it as, um, as priority.
47. Right? Um, so anyway, your refund should process in, uh, 3-5 days, and the replacement device REP-7634-XL will ship tomorrow. Also, just so you know, I'm adding a credit—
48. Oh! No no, sorry, um, I should've said—so I'm disabling the current one, like, right now actually. So effective immediately, transponder DVC-4419-NK is, uh... yep, just deactivated it. You'll need to pay cash until the new one arrives but at least no more ghost charges.
49. I mean... er, yeah, when you put it like that... Um, you know what? Let me just, uh, add a twenty dollar credit—code CRD-9901-MP—for the inconvenience, 'cause honestly? Making you pay cash after we messed up is... it's not great.
50. Of course! And um, hey, pro tip? If this happens again—which hopefully it won't but, uh, you know—just call and ask for the, er, the transponder echo dispute form. It's like a... shortcut? To get straight to someone who can fix it. Your case number again is CSE-8829-RT if you need to follow up!
51. Got it. Okay. Let me see here... um, so you're having crashes with the mobile app. Which version? Check under settings—should show, uh, something like APP-4.2.1 or similar.
52. Oh! Oh oh oh. I see what happened. That's... that's ancient. Like, um, really old. Version 3.8.2 had, uh, massive stability issues. Let me check your account ID real quick—what's your email?
53. Yep. Pulling up your account now... okay so, hmm, account ACT-77492-BK shows you've been stuck on 3.8.2 since, uh, wow, six months ago. Auto-update must've failed somehow.
54. Pretty much! Here's what we'll do. Delete it. Fresh install. I'm pushing, um, a priority update flag to your account right now—code UPD-9982-QX. Should force latest version.
55. Yeah yeah. Do it. I'll wait. Once you reinstall, um, there's gonna be a prompt for verification code. Ready? It's VER-445821. That'll sync everything back up instantly.
56. Right now! I love these. Easy fix. Big impact. So, um, while you're downloading—your transaction history under TXN-8847729-A through TXN-8847745-C? All preserved. Nothing lost.
57. VER-445821. Enter that. Should see, uh, a green checkmark, then your home screen. Everything exactly where you left it. Except, you know. Working.
58. Version 4.3.7! Night and day. That old version was, um, basically held together with digital duct tape. Your device ID DEV-337294-M is showing all green on my end now.
59. Happens constantly. People think it's them. It's not. Oh! Quick thing—I'm adding, um, note NFT-7739 to your account. Any issues next 30 days? Priority support. Skip the queue.
60. My pleasure! Seriously. These calls? Where I actually solve it? Best part of my day. Your confirmation number is CNF-994472-RT for this fix. Anything else breaks—don't wait six months!
61. Oh no worries at all. Let me just... pull that right up. Can I get your order number? Should start with ORD dash...
62. Perfect, um, so I'm seeing transaction TXN-884209551 here and, uh, it looks like the bank flagged it as, hmm... unusual activity. Nothing on our end at all. These security systems can be a bit... overzealous sometimes.
63. No no no. Happens constantly. Like, um, probably twenty times today already, so you're definitely not alone here.
64. Please don't! The verification code VRF-2245-QM shows... it's just. The amount triggered their system. Over five hundred automatically gets flagged if it's... a new merchant.
65. So, um, quick fix here is, uh, you could call them, or, hmm, sometimes if you just retry in like five minutes with the same card...
66. Usually works! The system logs attempt ATT-9901-DR as legitimate. Then the second one... goes right through. I'd say, um, seventy percent success rate? Maybe eighty.
67. Exactly. Though if you want... I can. Hold your order? Reference hold HLD-3367-VX for twenty-four hours while you sort it out.
68. Oh gosh, um, this is literally nothing compared to, uh, some of the payment issues we see, like yesterday someone's card got flagged for, er, suspected fraud because they bought coffee in two different states and, um, turns out they just drove fast.
69. Right? But hey. Your issue's easy. Transaction TXN-884209551 will clear once you... once the bank sees it's you.
70. Perfect! Um, and if it doesn't work, just, uh, call back with reference REF-6622-LP and we'll, hmm, we'll figure out plan B, okay? But I'm sure it'll... you know...
71. Oh my goodness, I am so, so sorry about that, um, I actually hate our phone system too, like honestly between you and me, it's it's absolutely terrible and I've complained about it myself to management probably a dozen times this month.
72. Definitely not just you, um, let me pull up your account here real quick, can I get your account number or phone number? And yeah, we get complaints about about the menu system constantly, it's... I mean, it's really frustrating for everyone...
73. Perfect, got it, so that's pulling up account ACC-7829-MK14, and um, while that's loading I just want to say I totally understand your frustration, like sometimes I call other companies and their menus are just as bad and I'm thinking why can't I just talk to a human, you know?
74. Um, that's actually a really interesting question, so like, from what I understand it's it's this whole committee thing with our tech team and, hmm, let me see, your account is showing ticket number TKT-3847-QR92 from last month, was that related to this too?
75. Got it got it, okay so what specifically were you trying to do today when you got stuck in the menu loop? I'm curious because maybe there's there's a shortcut I can share for next time...
76. Oh that one, yeah that's like the worst path in our whole system, um, so for payment updates you actually need authorization code PAY-5502-AUTH and, uh, the menu makes you go through fraud prevention first which then loops you back to... it's ridiculous honestly...
77. Unfortunately no, but but here's what I can do, um, I'm updating your payment method right now with reference number REF-9834-TK55, and uh, for future reference, if you just press zero like five times in a row, it usually breaks you out to a human.
78. Right right, I see that, you're on our Platinum tier with customer ID PLT-4429-VIP, which, um, honestly should give you a dedicated line but, uh, they haven't implemented that yet even though it's been promised for like two years now...
79. So for formal complaints you'd want case number CSE-7761-ESC which I'm creating right now, and um, I'm actually going to add my own notes here about how our VIP customers like yourself shouldn't have to deal with this, because honestly it's it's kind of embarrassing for the company.
80. I really appreciate you saying that, and um, listen, I've got your payment updated with confirmation CON-8455-PMT, and I'm also putting a note in your file with reference RNT-3092 that any agent who sees it should should immediately assist without the menu runaround, if that makes sense...
81. Got it got it. So you're—you're having trouble with the IVR system and um, I can—I can definitely help bypass that. Let me just—just pull up your account here if you've got that number handy?
82. Perfect. 4-7-2-8-9-5. That's—that's actually account ACT-472895-B in our system and I can see—see exactly what you mean about the IVR issues.
83. Right right. So what's—what's happening here is um, the system's expecting the—the full format with the prefix ACT and suffix B, but it's not—not telling people that which is, uh, pretty terrible design honestly.
84. Absolutely absolutely. I've—I've sent feedback ticket FBK-9923-TK about this, um, probably fifty times this month already. But hey, let me—let me help with whatever you actually called about?
85. No problem. I can—can take care of that right now. Your current card on file ends in 4429, expiration showing as, um, last month, so that's—that's definitely why any recent charges would've failed.
86. Whole number, exp date, CVV. And I'll—I'll also generate you a bypass code BYP-88512-X so um, next time you call, you can—can skip the whole automated nightmare completely.
87. Course course. Ready when—when you are for that card number. Take your time.
88. Got it got it. 5521-4455-8890-1234. Exp date and—and that three digit code on the back?
89. Perfect perfect. That's—that's all updated now, payment reference PAY-10847-QD is confirmed and, um, you're all set. The bypass code again is BYP-88512-X, just—just say "agent" then punch that in.
90. Hey no—no worries at all. Us humans gotta—gotta stick together against the machines, right? Anything else before I let you go?
91. Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear that. Let me, uh, pull up your account right away. Can I get your, um, order number or email?
92. No worries at all, take your time. Um, I completely understand how, uh, frustrating double charges can be. They're... er... they're really not okay.
93. Got it, um, pulling that up now. Okay so, uh, I can see here... transaction TXN-48291-BK shows, um, yes, there's definitely two charges for $89.99 each on October 15th.
94. Oh no no, you're not being difficult at all! This is, um, this is totally on us. I'm, uh, really limited in what I can do instantly but, er, I can definitely start the refund process right now.
95. I know, I know. Um, believe me, I wish I could just, uh, snap my fingers and fix it. The system takes, er, three to five business days for refunds and I'm... I'm honestly frustrated with that policy too.
96. No please, don't apologize! Um, you have every right to be upset. Let me, uh, at least get you a confirmation number - it's REF-71823-QM. And, um, I'm putting a priority flag on it.
97. So, um, technically it's still the same timeframe but, uh, it gets reviewed first each day. I wish I could promise more but, er, that's honestly the limit of what the system lets me do.
98. Oh please, you don't need to apologize at all! Um, tight months are, uh, they're real and this kind of error makes everything worse. I'm, er, genuinely sorry we put you in this position.
99. Right, so, um, if anything like this happens again - which, uh, it absolutely shouldn't - reference this case number CSE-92847-LD and, er, ask for a supervisor immediately. They have, um, more override options than I do.
100. I'm, uh, really sorry again about all this. Your refund REF-71823-QM is, um, definitely processing and you'll get an email confirmation within, er, within the hour. Is there, um, anything else I can help with today?
101. Okay so basically um let me just pull up your account real quick here and uh we'll get this sorted out for you no problem so what's your phone number?
102. Got it got it so um I'm seeing account number ACC-7739-PH21 here and uh basically it looks like your plan got suspended yesterday so that's probably why you're having issues right?
103. So like um the good news is we can definitely get this fixed real quick it's just showing a past due balance of eighty-seven fifty on invoice INV-442896 from last month so basically once we clear that up you'll be good to go.
104. Absolutely absolutely so um let me just set up a quick payment here and we'll have you back online in like two minutes tops so you want to use the card on file ending in 3847?
105. Perfect so um basically I'm processing that right now and uh your confirmation number is gonna be PAY-889264-L and like as soon as this goes through which should be any second now your service will automatically restore.
106. So like it's actually going through right now um I can see the payment posted and uh your service should be back in about thirty seconds to a minute max so you'll definitely be good for your shift.
107. Hey so um I totally get it like you just need your phone working for work right and uh good news is I'm seeing the reactivation signal sent to device ID DEV-7264-MNP so basically any second now you should see your bars come back.
108. There we go so like um it'll keep getting stronger over the next minute or two and uh basically your account ACC-7739-PH21 is showing fully active now so you're all set.
109. No no you're totally fine so um like I also went ahead and added a note to your account that you're an essential worker so basically if this ever happens again just mention reference code REF-3982-EW and we'll prioritize getting you back online.
110. Of course of course so like you're out there helping people right so um we gotta make sure your phone works and uh your next bill date is the fifteenth with autopay set up on transaction schedule TRX-8847-AUTO so you should be all good going forward.
111. Oh! Hi there! Yes yes. Let me just—actually wait—let me pull up your account. Quick. Need your member ID. Starts with VSN probably?
112. Got it got it! VSN-48293. Okay so um, I'm seeing here, uh, let me just... hmm... you've got like three recent claims? CLM-7782-VX, CLM-7791-VX, and um, CLM-7804-VX? I think those are—yeah. Which one?
113. Oh! Oh okay. Right right. So—no wait—let me actually look at the details here because I really want to help you get this sorted!
114. Absolutely! Yes! So um, for CLM-7782-VX I'm seeing, uh, a copay of forty-five dollars? And then. Wait. The allowable is... hmm... three twenty? Does that sort of match what you're seeing?
115. Right right! Okay so—let me just—I think maybe there's been a coding issue? Like um, procedure code 92015 instead of 92014? That would. Yeah. Change things.
116. Oh wow wow. Okay so um, I'm really excited because I think I can actually fix this! Let me just, uh, submit a correction batch? Takes about. Hmm. Five minutes?
117. Oh. Oh no. So you've—I mean—you've called before. About this. Same issue.
118. That's. Wow. I'm so sorry. Really. Let me—no wait—actually I'm going to escalate this? Like right now? To tier two? Reference number ESC-9847-TK22.
119. Because um, I'm giving you my direct extension? It's uh, 4782. And I'm. Look. I'm putting a personal flag. On your account. PFL-3392-XX. I'll check it. Tomorrow. Myself.
120. It will be! I promise! I mean—I think—no actually I know it will because um, I'm literally watching the escalation go through right now and... yeah. Confirmed. You'll get an email. Within the hour.
121. Oh! Okay okay so um, I can definitely help you with that, let me just—sorry, I need to pull up your account first, can I get your account number? It should be like ACC-something with numbers?
122. Perfect perfect, so ACC-4429-BK, I've got you here and—oh. Um. So I'm seeing that our standard history only goes back—wait no, sorry, I mean the online portal only shows thirty days but I can definitely get you more, how far back did you need?
123. No no no, it's totally fine, really! So um, here's the thing though—and I'm really sorry about this—but anything past ninety days requires a special request through our archives department with form FRM-2847-A and it usually takes three to five business days to process?
124. Right right, I know, I'm so sorry, I really wish I could just—let me check something else. Your account type is showing as standard tier STD-001 which means—oh wait, actually no, sorry, I was looking at the wrong screen.
125. Um, so like, here's what I can do right now, I can get you the last ninety days immediately through our quick export system QEX-7739, and then for the older stuff I could try to expedite the archive request but honestly? Even expedited is still like forty-eight hours minimum.
126. Absolutely, yes, so I'm starting with the ninety-day export now, reference number REF-558291-QE, and you should get that in your email within five minutes, is the address on file still active?
127. Showing j.martinez at, um—oh gosh, sorry, I shouldn't say the full thing out loud—starts with J-M-A-R and ends with gmail?
128. Got it got it, updating to the outlook address now and—okay so that's processing under transaction TXN-994587234, and then for the archive request I just need to ask you like three quick security questions if that's okay?
129. Oh no, yeah taxes are the worst, I'm so so sorry you're dealing with this! Um, okay so first question, can you verify the last four digits of the payment method on file?
130. Perfect, 8872, and I've got the archive request submitted under case number CSE-774429-ARC, and like I said, forty-eight hours for expedited, but um, honestly sometimes it comes through faster, especially for tax stuff, so maybe check tomorrow afternoon just in case?
131. Oh absolutely! Let me just, um, pull up your account here. Can you give me your, uh, your member ID or the account number? Should be something like MEM-followed by some numbers...
132. Perfect, okay okay, so I've got your account here, MEM-4782-B, and, hmm, I can see there's a billing issue from last month. Let me just, um, dig into this a bit more and see what's... oh, looks like there was a duplicate charge on October 15th, transaction ID TXN-889204-QV.
133. Oh definitely, definitely! So, um, what I'm gonna do here is, uh, issue a refund for that duplicate charge, and hmm, it'll show up as credit CRD-2847-PK on your next statement, which should post in about, um, three to five business days...
134. I know, I know, waiting is never fun! Um, actually, let me see if I can... hmm, okay so if I submit this as priority request PRQ-5502-TL, we might be able to get it done by tomorrow?
135. No no no, don't apologize! This is, uh, this is literally my job, and honestly? The system should've caught this duplicate charge in the first place. Let me just, um, make sure I've got everything right here—so that's refund for $127.50, reference number REF-9903-XM?
136. Oh! Oh oh, let me, uh, let me check that again... pulling up the original charge here and... you're absolutely right, I was looking at the wrong line item. Sorry about that! So it's it's $145.00, and I'm updating the refund request right now, new reference is REF-9904-XN.
137. Totally understand, um, sounds like you've got a lot on your plate. Okay so, uh, everything's submitted now under case number CSE-7701-RD, and you should get an email confirmation in about, hmm, ten minutes or so?
138. Actually wait, um, before you go—I'm just gonna, uh, add a note here that says to expedite this, and... there! Also, I'm seeing you might qualify for our, um, our educator discount? Says here you work at a school?
139. Yeah yeah! So, um, we've got this program, code EDU-DISC-2024, that's like 15% off monthly premiums for school staff? I can just, uh, I can apply that retroactively too if you want, going back three months...
140. No worries at all, seriously! Okay so I've applied the educator discount, confirmation EDD-3398-KT, and, um, with the refund and the retroactive discount, you should actually see about $218.50 coming back total. Is there, uh, is there anything else I can help with today?
141. Oh, um, okay so, uh, let me just pull that up for you here and, hmm, we're talking about transferring ownership? So like, um, I can totally help with that—just need to, uh, verify account number ACT-9982-MK first?
142. Right right, so, um, here's the thing—and like, between you and me? The system's, uh, kind of a pain about this stuff, but um, I've done like a million of these so we'll, er, we'll figure it out. Do you happen to have the, uh, the account number or maybe the email it's under?
143. Hey, no worries at all, seriously. Um, so like, I can actually, uh, look it up a different way—what's, er, what's the last name on the account? And, hmm, maybe the zip code?
144. Perfect! Okay so, um, I'm seeing account ACT-7736-QP here under, uh, Robert Wilson? And like, just so you know? The whole transfer process is, er, honestly kind of ridiculous—corporate makes us do all these, um, verification steps but I'll walk you through everything.
145. So, uh, normally? It's like five business days which is, hmm, absolutely insane, I know. But um, here's what I can do—there's this, er, expedited option using form TRF-2847 that, uh, basically nobody knows about? Takes like 24 hours instead.
146. Oh wait, um, is this for, uh, is this an estate situation?
147. Oh man, I'm so, so sorry. Um, okay so like, this changes things—in a good way actually. For, uh, for estate transfers we have this whole different process with priority code EST-990-PRIORITY and, er, we can actually get this done like, today if you have the, um, the death certificate?
148. Yeah, absolutely. So like, between you and me? The company's usually, um, pretty terrible about most things but, uh, estate stuff they actually handle really well. I just need to, er, grab reference number REF-44821-EST real quick and, um, I can email you the secure upload link?
149. Perfect, that works. And hey, um, while you're looking? I'm gonna go ahead and, uh, pre-fill everything I can on my end using case number CSE-8892-W so like, you'll literally just need to, er, upload that one document and boom, done.
150. Totally get it, seriously. So, um, I just sent that secure link to, uh, let me confirm—r.wilson at gmail? And like, once you upload it, you'll get confirmation code CNF-7736-FINAL within, hmm, about an hour. And honestly? If anything goes weird, just, uh, reference this call ID CLL-99284 and ask for me directly—I'll make sure it goes through.
151. Let me just—okay, um, pulling up your account here. What's the, uh, the name on the account?
152. Got it, got it. So I've got account BUS-4429-JL here, and um, let me just, uh, check the rental history—what equipment are we talking about specifically?
153. Okay okay. So I'm seeing, um, rental ID RNT-88264-A for a core aerator, and it shows, uh, picked up October 15th, returned October 22nd, so that's the full week charge of—
154. Right right. Let me just—hmm, actually I'm seeing a, uh, what's the word... a notation here. Says "customer declined receipt at return." Did you maybe—
155. Sure, sure. So without that return receipt RCP-15102, the system just, um, it keeps charging until we do the physical inventory check, which was October 22nd.
156. Look, I totally—let me just—I can actually override this. Been here long enough. Adjusting to one-day rental, credit memo CRD-9847-X processing now.
157. Yep. Shows, uh, $340 credit back to your account. Should hit in, um, 2-3 business days, reference number REF-2024-10-8892.
158. No no, totally get it. Equipment costs are, um, they're brutal right now. Just, uh, next time grab that receipt, saves us both the headache.
159. All good. Oh and, uh, looks like you've got reservation RES-90125-B for the overseed tomorrow—still need that?
160. Perfect. Got you confirmed. Anything else I can, uh, help you with today?
161. Oh! Okay, um, let me just... I think I can help with that, so, uh, if you could maybe give me your confirmation number or, um, actually the booking reference would be... that'd be great.
162. Right right, so, um, I'm pulling up... okay so I see booking HTL-3847-QM92 and, uh, yeah there's definitely some... hmm, that's interesting actually, I think I see what might've...
163. Ha! Okay so, um, between you and me? I'm seeing, uh, multiple duplicate charges here on transaction TXN-88291-KX and, um, someone probably hit submit too many times in their system... happens more than you'd think, honestly.
164. Absolutely their mistake, I mean, uh, look at this... reference code RCP-90523-J shows, um, the same twenty-nine dollar charge hitting six times at, uh, exactly 11:47 PM which is... that's not even possible manually.
165. So, um, what I'm gonna do here is... well, I probably shouldn't say this but, uh, I'm filing this under ERR-CODE-7729 which basically means, um, automatic full refund plus, uh, let me see if I can...
166. Oh no no, um, that's the beauty of it, so case number CSE-44981-BN9 is gonna, uh, reverse everything and... actually, hmm, you coach baseball right? My kid's trying out for JV next month.
167. Position player but, um, he thinks he can pitch? I don't know, anyway so, uh, your refund reference REF-30847-TT should post in, um, probably three days but sometimes it's faster if...
168. Really? That's... okay I'm definitely telling him that. So, um, confirmation number CNF-88930-XK2 is in your email and, uh, just so you know? Next time something like this happens, ask for the, um, the duplicate charge protocol...
169. Well I mean, um, that's what I'm here for but also... hang on, let me just, uh, add a note to account NTE-55981-P that you're a, um, preferred customer so if this ever...
170. Between you and me? Um, there's no official preferred status but, uh, I put flags on accounts when someone's cool about stuff, and your flag FLG-22847-M just says, um, "baseball coach, good guy, fix his stuff fast" so... yeah.
171. Sure thing! So I can definitely help you switch that over to paper statements for your account. Let me just... pull up your profile here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with the account?
172. Perfect perfect. Okay so I've got your account here, account number ACC-88972-VK, and I can see you're currently enrolled in our paperless billing system since... looks like March of last year.
173. Absolutely, um, so basically I can, uh, switch you over right now and, er, your next statement will be mailed to the address on file. Let me just... okay. So that's going to be 1847 Riverside Drive, is that still correct?
174. Oh! Riverdale, got it got it. Let me update that... R-I-V-E-R-D-A-L-E. Alright so. Your reference number for this change is REF-29384-QM and you should receive your first paper statement within... seven to ten business days.
175. Yeah so, um, I totally get that, and, uh, honestly if I could make it faster I would but, er, that's just the standard processing time for the switch from electronic to paper. The system has to... cycle through. Your next billing date is the 15th so you'll definitely have it before then.
176. Of course, of course. Um, so like, if you need a statement right away, uh, I could actually email you a PDF that you could print? And then, er, the official paper ones would start coming after that.
177. Right. Yeah. Hmm. Okay so... let me check something else here. Sometimes we can expedite these requests if there's a specific reason. Is there, um, any particular urgency I should note in the system?
178. Not at all, not at all! So, um, like I said, it's all set up now, reference REF-29384-QM, and, uh, you'll get paper statements from now on. Er, is there anything else about your account preferences you'd like to change while we're at it?
179. No worries at all! Totally understand. So just to confirm everything: paper statements will be mailed to 1847 Riverdale Drive, starting with your next cycle, and your confirmation is REF-29384-QM.
180. You're very welcome! And, um, just so you know, if you ever need to switch back to electronic or, er, make any other changes, you can always call us back or actually do it yourself online in your account settings under delivery preferences. Have a great rest of your day!
181. Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's happening, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and... hmm, can you give me your member ID so I can, um, take a look at what's going on?
182. Okay, um, thank you, so I'm looking at member ID MED-4937-B22 and, uh, I can see... oh, hmm, there's a charge here from, um, let me just... it's showing as transaction TXN-093847-HC for $247.50, is that the one you're, uh, asking about?
183. So, um, I'm really sorry but it's showing as, uh, "Medical Equipment Supply" and the reference is REF-8829-QM, which is, um, kind of vague, I know, and uh...
184. Right right, I completely understand, and I can see why that would be concerning, especially since... let me check if there's more detail in claim CLM-77293-XP about what specific items this covered.
185. Um, well, here's the thing, and I'm, uh, really sorry about how confusing this is, but it looks like... hmm, the charge is from, um, "Precision Medical Supplies" with vendor code VND-3847-PS, does that ring any bells at all?
186. I understand completely, and this must be really frustrating, so what I can do is initiate a dispute under case number DSP-994637-R and we'll investigate this charge thoroughly.
187. So, um, typically these disputes take, uh, about 5 to 7 business days, but I'm going to, um, mark this as priority under code PRI-8826-A because I can see you're, uh, in the medical field yourself and probably need your HSA funds available.
188. Oh no, I'm so, so sorry you've been through this before, that's just... um, let me look at your history here and, uh, I can see case DSP-882910-T from last month, is that what you're referring to?
189. That's completely unacceptable, I'm just... um, I'm really sorry, let me, uh, escalate both of these right now to our resolution team and, um, I'm putting in override code OVR-7749-EM to expedite everything.
190. Absolutely, I completely understand, and I promise I'm going to personally monitor both case DSP-994637-R and your previous case to make sure they're resolved within 48 hours, not weeks.
191. Okay okay so, um, let me just—I'm pulling up your account here and, uh, I need to make sure I'm getting you the right—the right information because, um, 401k withdrawals have, like, specific rules and I want to—let me see here... your account number is ACC-48291-BK7 right?
192. Right right so, um, there's—okay so basically there's a few things happening here and I want to make sure you understand all the—um, let me break this down properly because, uh, I see you have about $12,847 in your account under plan ID PLN-7764-QR and, um, if you withdraw before age 59½ there's gonna be—
193. Yes! Yes you can—you can absolutely, um, access it but, uh, let me just—I need to tell you about the penalties so you're not surprised later because, um, I want to protect you from any shock when you see the final amount.
194. No no no, um, not half, so it's—let me calculate this exact—exactly for you here... okay so with your balance of $12,847 under transaction code TXN-9982741-M, you're looking at, um, a 10% early withdrawal penalty plus, uh, regular income tax withholding which is usually—usually around 20% federal so—
195. Um, actually let me—let me run the exact calculation here because, uh, I want to give you the precise—hmm, okay so after the penalty and withholding on withdrawal request WDR-5541-TK9, you'd receive approximately, um, $8,993 but wait—wait actually there might be state tax too depending on—
196. Oh no no, um, don't apologize, I totally—I totally understand and, uh, let me make this super simple for you, okay? So basically, um, if you need the money, we can process withdrawal form FRM-1122-WD9 and have funds in your account within, uh, 7-10 business days.
197. Actually actually, um, yes! So there's—let me check your eligibility for hardship withdrawal under code HWD-3387-X because, uh, that might actually help you avoid some of the—hmm, what's your situation if you don't mind me asking?
198. Okay so, um, that definitely—that definitely qualifies as hardship and, uh, I'm gonna set you up with the expedited process right now using reference REF-6672-EVT and basically, um, we can get this moving faster, like 3-5 days instead and I'm also—let me see what else I can do here to help protect your—
199. Right right and, um, I'm also gonna—gonna note in your file under case number CSE-10094-RP that this is urgent housing-related so, uh, if anyone questions it or tries to slow it down, we have documentation and, um, I'll personally monitor this to make sure it goes through smooth—smoothly.
200. No no no, um, please don't worry about it at all, I completely—completely get it and, uh, listen I'm gonna give you my direct extension EXT-4429 and reference number REF-88512-HW so if you need anything or, um, if there's any delay just call me directly and I'll—I'll push it through myself, okay? We're gonna get you through this.
201. Oh my goodness, I do [overly polite] apologize, but I believe you're referring to blanching the spinach with purple shallots until properly wilted, correct?
202. The temperature should be [cry loudly] exactly 185 degrees Fahrenheit! That's the perfect blanching temperature to preserve nutrients while achieving optimal texture in leafy greens.
203. Right right, you want to shock them in, er, ice water immediately after blanching. The thing is, this stops the cooking process and maintains that vibrant green color.
204. The griddle needs [very melancholic] to be seasoned first. Cast iron requires multiple layers of flaxseed oil polymerized at 450 degrees for proper non-stick surface development.
205. Folding technique matters tremendously, actually, especially with delicate batters. You know, the Japanese use a cutting motion, hmm, rather than stirring to preserve air bubbles in tempura batter.
206. Burnt edges can be [mumbling] salvaged sometimes. Deglaze the pan with white wine vinegar, scrape up those caramelized bits, they're pure concentrated flavor for your sauce base.
207. Deep frying requires, uh, maintaining oil at precisely 350-375 degrees. Well, a candy thermometer is essential, you know, because temperature fluctuations of even 10 degrees affect crispiness dramatically.
208. Whisking technique absolutely impacts emulsification success! Mayo requires steady, consistent circular motions while slowly drizzling oil to create stable suspension of fat molecules.
209. Never open the oven door during the first twenty minutes! Soufflés need consistent temperature and the sudden cold air will collapse the delicate protein foam structure instantly.
210. Flambéing needs high-proof alcohol, so, at least 80 proof for proper ignition. Anyway, always tilt the pan away from yourself, I guess, and remove it from heat before adding alcohol for safety.
211. Oh god, that's the worst feeling in the world. I remember when my roommate did that to me, left me completely stranded with double rent and this crushing sense of betrayal.
212. Well, I mean, sure, redecorating sounds fun until you're basically scrambling to find someone who won't destroy your newly decorated space within a week.
213. Oh uhh, finding a decent roommate is sort of [sarcastic] super easy these days, anyway, everyone's totally normal with no bizarre habits or red flags whatsoever.
214. Look, I've been through seven roommates in five years, and each one started with optimism and ended with me changing the locks and deep cleaning mysterious stains.
215. The thing is, hmm, those interviews are torture—people lie about everything, actually, from their cleanliness habits to whether they have secret pet ferrets they're hiding.
216. A reality show? I guess that's one way to frame it, uh, though honestly most reality shows end in tears and lawsuits if we're being realistic here.
217. Questionnaires are great until someone seems perfect on paper, well, then you know [pause] they move in and suddenly they're practicing bagpipes at 3am, basically every night.
218. The odds are higher than you think. This city is full of people pretending to be normal while harboring deeply concerning habits that only emerge after signing a lease.
219. Absolutely.
220. I wasn't agreeing, I was surrendering to your relentless optimism, but sure, go ahead and learn these lessons the hard way like the rest of us did.
221. Oh no, that's never a good sign. How far behind are we talking here? Like thirty days, sixty, or are we venturing into the terrifying ninety-plus territory where clients pretend they've forgotten we exist?
222. Well, I mean, that's actually [friendly] pretty common these days, you know, especially with bigger clients who, uh, think they can just push smaller vendors around whenever they feel like it.
223. Oh, so the medium ones are, hmm, the worst offenders sometimes, honestly, because they're big enough to have complicated approval processes but, like, not organized enough to actually follow them properly.
224. Poor Janet, she's probably hitting that wall where people see her number and just let it go to voicemail because they know exactly what she's calling about and they're avoiding the conversation.
225. The thing is, there's this weird balance where you need to be persistent enough to get paid but not so annoying that they decide to find a new vendor out of spite.
226. Their system! Oh that's [animated] my absolute favorite excuse because somehow their system is always down for payables but miraculously works perfectly when they're collecting money from their own customers!
227. I had a client once who used that excuse for six months straight, and then I found out from their receptionist that they'd actually upgraded their system twice during that period.
228. Yeah, collections agencies are [regretful] kind of the nuclear option, and once you go there, the relationship is basically dead, which is rough if they're otherwise a good client who just happens to be terrible at paying.
229. Absolutely.
230. Deposits are completely standard now, and any client who balks at a reasonable deposit probably wasn't planning to pay you promptly anyway, so you're just filtering out future headaches before they start.
231. Well, I mean, that's certainly one [regretful] way to look at it, you know, though most people wouldn't describe chasing down payments as, um, particularly adventurous or fun.
232. Detective work implies there's a mystery to solve, but we know exactly where the money is - it's sitting in their accounts while they hope we'll forget about it.
233. A dance where one partner keeps stepping on your toes and pretending they didn't notice while you're trying not to scream in pain.
234. You enjoy it? Really? Most people would rather have a root canal than chase down overdue invoices, but I suppose someone has to find the silver lining in accounts receivable hell.
235. Laughing is good, I guess, but did they, uh, actually commit to paying, or were they just, basically, charmed into forgetting why you called?
236. Wait, you turned a collections call into a golf invitation? That's actually impressive, though I'm not sure if that's a scalable collections strategy for the rest of us mere mortals.
237. Sure, but most of us don't have, er, your particular gift for making people, you know, forget they owe us money while somehow, actually, still getting them to pay.
238. My approach usually involves a spreadsheet, three follow-up emails, and a gradually increasing sense of existential dread, which surprisingly doesn't yield golf invitations.
239. Oh absolutely, though I think, um, we both know which role I'd be playing, honestly.
240. It could work, I suppose, like, assuming your charm doesn't, well, wear off when they realize we're basically just, you know, asking for our money again.
241. That's definitely an optimistic way to frame what most people would consider the seventh circle of corporate hell, but I suppose someone needs to find joy in repeatedly asking people to pay their bills.
242. Er, that's actually a fascinating comparison, kind of makes me wonder if, the thing is, you're either a genius or completely delusional about what collections work really involves.
243. Understanding their challenges is one thing, but at the end of the day we still need them to cut us a check, which is considerably less romantic than your vision of financial therapy sessions.
244. Hmm, I guess your approach does seem to be working, anyway, though I'm still not entirely convinced that treating collections like speed dating is a sustainable business model.
245. So forty-five minutes of, uhh, personal conversation before even getting to business, it's just that I'm really wondering if that's efficient, though I suppose relationship building has its merits.
246. Well, becoming friends with every client does sound nice, I mean, but sort of exhausting when you consider we have, honestly, hundreds of overdue accounts to manage every month.
247. Ah, I see what you're saying, basically you're playing the long game here, I guess building relationships that, anyway, theoretically make future collections easier and more pleasant.
248. Looking forward to collections calls is like looking forward to dental surgery, but I have to admit your success rate has been remarkably high lately.
249. That could be interesting, though I suspect my spreadsheets might dampen your enthusiasm for turning every invoice chase into a personal bonding experience.
250. Fine, we can try it your way, but if I end up discussing anyone's weekend plans for more than five minutes, I'm billing you for therapy services.
251. Oh that's a dangerous topic to bring up [playful] considering how many creative interpretations of "business dinner" I've seen come across my desk this month.
252. Both, absolutely both, and the mental gymnastics people perform to justify a weekend trip to Vegas as "client relationship building" would win Olympic gold medals.
253. Well, that's the thing, you know, not everyone does it but, hmm, enough people do that it's become this sort of unspoken corporate tradition that nobody wants to fully address.
254. The line is, er, technically very clear in policy but, anyway, in practice it's about as blurry as, uhh, a watercolor painting left out in the rain.
255. Your manager explicitly told you to misclassify personal transportation as client entertainment, which sounds like they're either joking or actively encouraging expense fraud.
256. Ah, the classic "everyone at my level" defense which, basically, translates to "I've been doing this so long that, well, I've convinced myself it's somehow justified."
257. That's a tough one because, [cough], reporting it could, err, protect you legally but, it's just that, it might also make you persona non grata in the office.
258. Standing up for ethics shouldn't torpedo anything in a healthy company, but, hmm, we both know that's not, anyway, how office politics actually work in reality.
259. Document everything in writing, keep copies of any instructions to falsify expenses, and maybe start casually looking for other opportunities where ethics aren't treated as optional.
260. The shadiness was probably always there, you're just seeing it now because you're paying attention, which honestly makes you more ethically aware than ninety percent of corporate America.
261. Yeah, the one with the spiral staircase? Pretty clever use of space, though I wonder how his parents feel about having a permanent houseguest twenty feet from their kitchen window.
262. Smaller than tiny? So like, what, a shed with a hot plate, basically? I mean, at that point you might as well just live in your car.
263. Fair point. But seriously, where would you even put it? Most cities have minimum square footage requirements for dwellings.
264. That changes things. Rural zoning is way more flexible, plus you'd have space for solar panels and maybe even a little garden.
265. There are [enunciating every word] actually tons of prefab kits now. Some company delivers all the pieces and you just assemble it like expensive IKEA furniture, takes maybe a weekend with help.
266. Well, you're looking at, [deep pitch] er, anywhere from fifteen to fifty thousand, the thing is, it depends on how fancy you want to get. Basic shell versus full electrical and plumbing makes a huge difference.
267. Yeah, tiny doesn't mean cheap unfortunately. But compared to regular housing prices it's still a bargain, especially if you can avoid taking out a mortgage.
268. Exactly, and honestly, you could probably, hmm, do it for less if you source materials yourself, you know? Craigslist has free windows and doors all the time from renovations.
269. Right so, why not actually start small, I mean really small, like maybe a shed office first? You could practice the basics without committing to living in it.
270. Plus, well, if it turns out terrible, you know, at least you've only built a terrible shed, basically, not a terrible house. Lower stakes for your first construction project.
271. Fascinating question—here's what captivates me: whether or not auras exist, these individuals are often remarkably perceptive about emotional states; they're picking up microexpressions, body language, vocal patterns... synthesizing data we all receive but rarely process consciously.
272. Not "just" observant—I mean, that's reductive, honestly. They're, well, pattern recognition savants, basically; processing thousands of subtle cues simultaneously, then translating that flood of information into visual metaphors their brains can comprehend.
273. Synesthesia! That's, you know, a legitimate neurological phenomenon where, er, sensory pathways cross-wire; some people taste words, others see music—your cousin might actually, hmm, be experiencing emotional data as color.
274. Ha! But here's—actually, here's what's remarkable: the effort itself, uhh, changes your attention; suddenly you're, I mean, hyperaware of subtle energies, proximities, tensions between people... the "aura" becomes real through observation.
275. EXACTLY—brilliant connection! Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, but, umm, applied to human perception; we literally, sort of, cannot observe without altering, and perhaps that's why, honestly, different readers "see" different auras.
276. Belief feels... inadequate here; I acknowledge the experience while questioning the mechanism—imagine if someone from 1850 saw an MRI scan showing brain activity; they'd call it magic, spiritual revelation!
277. Precisely—and consider this: we accept that dogs smell cancer, that elephants sense earthquakes days early; why shouldn't humans have latent sensitivities we've simply forgotten how to access?
278. The real question isn't "are auras real?"—it's "what information are aura readers accessing, and how?" Because clearly, SOMETHING is happening; too many accurate readings for pure chance.
279. See? Data point! Whether she's reading electromagnetic fields, pheromones, micro-movements, or something we haven't discovered yet... she's tapping into SOMETHING, translating the ineffable into the visual.
280. Beautiful approach—surrender the mechanism, embrace the phenomenon; after all, we use electricity daily without most of us truly understanding electrons... mystery and utility aren't mutually exclusive!
281. Oh wow, um, of course, I didn't realize— you know, sometimes I get carried away with these topics and, well, completely miss when someone's uncomfortable.
282. Hey hey, no worries at all, [over confidently] I totally get it— actually, when I'm stressed, abstract conversations are like, you know, trying to read through frosted glass, just impossible.
283. That sounds really rough. Do you want to just sit quietly for a minute? Sometimes that's all we need, just someone there without the pressure to perform or explain.
284. Movement helps then? We could walk, or I could just ramble about something totally mundane while you pace— whatever feels right, no judgment here.
285. Because telling someone to calm down is, [delighted] honestly, the most useless advice ever— I mean, it's like telling someone who's drowning to, uhh, just swim better, you know?
286. Listen, vulnerability isn't embarrassing, it's human. Plus, sometimes strangers are easier— no history, no expectations, just two people being real for a minute.
287. Okay, that's a panic response, totally normal even though it feels terrifying. Your body thinks there's a tiger but there's not— just your nervous system misfiring.
288. I hear you, and that feeling is, [very quickly] um, so valid even though, actually, objectively nothing's attacking you right now— er, your brain just can't tell the difference between real and perceived threats.
289. You're not broken, you're overwhelmed, and those are completely different things. This will pass, it always does, even when it feels eternal in the moment.
290. That's okay, your body doesn't need to believe me right now. Just keep talking, keep moving, keep existing— sometimes that's the bravest thing we can do.
291. Oh man, so, there was this time in Peru when I, you know, completely misjudged a river crossing— the locals were basically screaming at me to stop but I was too stubborn to listen.
292. Honestly, it was definitely more stupid than brave— like, the current knocked me off my feet immediately and I was, er, basically pinballing between rocks for what felt like forever.
293. For about thirty seconds, absolutely. But then this weird calm kicked in and my body just took over— grabbed a branch, pulled myself out, threw up river water for ten minutes.
294. Because, well, getting knocked around taught me more about respecting nature than, you know, any guidebook ever could— plus, um, the adrenaline aftermath was honestly incredible.
295. Hey, that's totally valid. Not everyone processes fear the same way— for me, near-misses make me feel more alive, but my sister won't even go camping after a bad thunderstorm experience.
296. Oh god, actually, my mom has this whole ritual now where she, like, lights candles whenever I travel— err, she pretends it's just for ambiance but I know better.
297. Sometimes, yeah. But they also love hearing the stories afterward— my dad keeps this scrapbook of all my adventures, newspaper clippings and photos and everything.
298. Probably the bull shark in [bitter] Fiji that, uhh, decided my kayak looked interesting— honestly, I still get nightmares about those dead eyes just, you know, circling and circling.
299. Yeah, though now I, er, definitely check local shark reports first— I mean, I'm adventurous, not suicidal, and there's really no shame in being cautiously reckless.
300. Exactly! It's about, well, calculating risks while still saying yes to experiences— like, anyway, you can be smart about being stupid, if that makes any sense at all.
301. Oh perfect, nothing says [frustrated] friendship like dividing an odd number by twelve people who ordered wildly different things— should we just split evenly and pretend Derek didn't order three appetizers?
302. Right, er, so Derek's basically looking at about ninety bucks honestly, while Sarah had a salad and water— this is why restaurants should just give everyone separate checks automatically.
303. Half the table uses Venmo, three people only have Zelle, and grandpa brought exact change in coins— this is going to take longer than the actual meal did.
304. That was birthday girl's "gift" apparently, which means we're all splitting it except nobody told Marcus who doesn't drink— he's already doing the angry nostril flare thing.
305. Credit card roulette! Except last time we did that, the server accidentally charged everything to one card and poor Jennifer's account got frozen for suspicious activity.
306. That was Brad, who insists ten percent is generous because "back in his day"— meanwhile our server is literally standing there watching us argue about quarters.
307. Sure, let's penalize the vegetarians and reward the carnivores— Emma's already pulling up her itemized spreadsheet with color-coded cells for shared appetizers.
308. She's [extremely happy] got formulas for tax distribution and everything— last month she invoiced us all with payment terms and a late fee structure!
309. Twenty-three fifty for food, your beer's five, tax brings you to thirty-one, and if we're doing twenty percent tip— congratulations, you owe exactly thirty-seven dollars!
310. And here we go with the change-making chain reaction— by the time this is over, we'll all somehow owe each other money and the restaurant will have closed for the night.
311. Well, I've actually got, um, my phone calculator ready here. Look, if everyone just tells me what they ordered, I mean, I can have individual totals in two minutes— tax and tip included.
312. Already started a list! Marcus, you had the steak frites at twenty-eight; Jenny, salmon at thirty-two. Just shout out your mains and I'll handle the mental gymnastics— easier than watching you all suffer.
313. Right, so, those were forty-two total, which is, er, three-fifty per person if we split evenly. Unless someone didn't touch the calamari? No judgment, honestly, but it helps the math if you speak up now.
314. Lisa! You know, you're down to just the bruschetta then, which is, uh, fourteen divided by... actually, six people had that one. That's two thirty-three each— I'm keeping track, don't worry.
315. Restaurant trauma from college, basically— four years of these exact arguments, so, I built a system. See? Everyone's name, their items, shared costs calculated proportionally... it's actually really satisfying once you get the hang of it.
316. Jake had— [gasp loudly] five glasses?! Okay, that's seventy dollars of wine on his tab alone. The bottle was ninety, you had twenty worth, he gets the rest— this is exactly why I document everything.
317. Happy to help! I find that [overly polite] mathematical precision prevents those awkward "you owe me seven dollars" texts for the next three weeks. Plus, everyone feels heard when the split's actually fair, don't you think?
318. Already checked— no auto-grat! They only do that for parties of fifteen or more, so we need to add twenty percent ourselves. That's forty-nine dollars and change total, which splits to about four bucks each for tip.
319. Marcus! Look, um, I've got your total at thirty-four even— that's including, honestly, your exact portion of appetizers minus the calamari you didn't touch. See the breakdown? Steak, bruschetta portion, tax, tip— completely transparent.
320. Just promise me we're using separate checks next time! My phone's at two percent battery and I can see Derek reaching for the dessert menu— absolutely not happening on my watch.
321. Oh this? Yeah, so, I've been growing it since, honestly, last February specifically for today! My daughter bet me fifty bucks I couldn't commit to a year-long Santa transformation, and well, here we are proving her wrong.
322. She's ruthless! Actually, she's running too— over there in the, uh, elf costume with the LED lights. This is our fourth Santa run together, though last year I just wore a fake beard like, you know, a normal person would.
323. Oh you picked, I mean, the best one to start with! This route goes [passionately] right through downtown, er, past all the shop windows— the kids line up to watch, and honestly, it's magical. Plus the after-party raises money for the children's hospital wing renovation.
324. No way! Is it Sarah Chen? She fixed my knee after I completely destroyed it training for an ultramarathon— brilliant woman, absolutely saved my running career.
325. Classic Sarah move! She probably didn't mention the hills on kilometer three though, or the fact that running in a Santa suit adds about ten degrees to your body temperature— rookie hazing, basically.
326. Don't worry, they're baby hills! Just stick with me and my daughter's group— we maintain a steady pace, take walking breaks at every water station, and nobody gets left behind, Santa code of honor.
327. Absolutely! Rule one: no competitive racing— this is about joy, not times. Rule two: high-five every kid you see. Rule three: if someone's struggling, you help them, even if it means walking the whole thing together.
328. Most fun runs are like this! The serious racers have their own events, but things like Santa runs, zombie runs, color runs— these are about community and laughing at yourself while doing something slightly ridiculous for charity.
329. Oh they're in for disappointment! Look, basically, the energy here [slowly] carries you through— between the, hmm, Christmas music blasting and two thousand Santas cheering each other on, you know, you'll finish before you know it.
330. Wait until you see the, uh, starting line— it's a sea of red! Actually, quick tip: tie your, well, hat on tight because the wind tunnel effect when we all start running is, honestly, something else entirely.
331. Listen, superhero costumes and public transit were not designed to coexist peacefully. The cape got caught in the door, then wrapped around some lady's stroller, and I basically clotheslined myself trying to untangle it— peak dignity right there.
332. Captain Catastrophe! He's my own creation— his superpower is that everything he touches breaks in comedically inconvenient ways. I figured if I'm gonna embarrass myself at these things anyway, might as well lean into it.
333. Right? Last year I went as Superman and spent the whole time apologizing for not being buff enough. This year when kids ask for photos, I just knock something over and yell "Captain Catastrophe strikes again!" Way less pressure.
334. Oh for the love of— see, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Even my costume is in character. Though between you and me, I put it on backwards on purpose because it looks funnier when I run.
335. There's a costume race at noon! Basically, fifty nerds sprinting, well, in full cosplay— last year Spider-Man, uh, lost his mask mid-race and just kept going with his regular face showing, absolutely killed the mystique.
336. My thirteen-year-old niece thinks I'm the coolest uncle ever, which is hilarious because I'm literally just desperate for her approval. She sends me Instagram posts and I show up places dressed like an idiot— it's a beautiful system.
337. The orange was actually, you know, a printing error— supposed to be red, but honestly, the print shop messed up and I thought, hey, Captain Catastrophe would definitely, um, order the wrong color cape.
338. Oh you have no idea— I've got business cards that, er, self-destruct when you touch them, literally just dissolve into glitter, and honestly, the mess is, well, absolutely worth people's reactions.
339. The glitter is biodegradable! Had to special order it from some eco-craft website after the convention center banned me from using regular glitter— apparently "glitter bombing" paying customers is frowned upon, who knew?
340. Just from using glitter! I can still attend, thankfully, though they, um, [long pause] specifically mentioned no confetti cannons either, which honestly feels targeted because that was, you know, ONE time and the sprinklers barely went off.
341. Yeah, sorry about that— I'm calibrating the new gimbal system for a real estate shoot tomorrow. These commercial drones sound like angry wasps when you're doing precision adjustments, but it should only take another few minutes.
342. Well, I started with, um, photography actually, then realized I could, [chuckle], charge three times as much if, you know, I added aerial shots to the package.
343. The learning curve was brutal though— crashed my first drone into a client's chimney on day two. Insurance saved me, but watching five thousand dollars fall off a roof in pieces really makes you question your life choices.
344. So, the professional ones are, [bored], basically flying computers— you know, dual cameras, obstacle avoidance, actually, forty-five minute flight times, thermal imaging if you need it.
345. This guy wanted me to follow his ex-girlfriend's [angry] wedding procession from above— absolutely not! I don't do surveillance, stalking, or anything that would make me explain myself to a judge, period.
346. Oh, you'd be surprised— I get, well, [friendly], all kinds of requests, honestly, from people wanting to spy on neighbors to, um, checking if their spouse is really at work.
347. Most people think if, you know, it's in the air it's fair game, but actually, there are, uh, strict regulations about privacy, airspace, and basically, where you can fly.
348. Real estate pays the bills, honestly— realtors want, well, those sweeping shots that, you know, make a two-bedroom ranch look like, um, a countryside estate.
349. Lost one to a hawk last month— thing just swooped down and knocked it clean out of the sky. The footage of the attack was incredible though, right up until the camera cut out.
350. Right? The hawk probably thought it was defending territory from some weird mechanical bird— can't really blame it, though my wallet definitely disagreed with that philosophical position.
351. Oh that's insurance speak for, um, "we're going to drag this out," actually, as long as humanly possible while we find any excuse, you know, not to pay you.
352. Three weeks is nothing— so, I once waited, honestly, four months for them to approve replacing a bumper, and that was after, uh, their own driver admitted fault!
353. The adjuster kept claiming the damage was [animated] pre-existing even though I had photos from literally the day before showing a pristine car— they just wear you down until you give up.
354. Only after I threatened to contact the state insurance commissioner and started posting about it on their social media pages every single day— suddenly they found the funds!
355. Look, the trick is to be, [cheerful] kind of relentlessly annoying but always, I mean, technically polite— hmm, document everything, every phone call, every email, every excuse they give.
356. That's exactly why they're stalling— they know most people will either accept less or just give up entirely if they make the process painful enough.
357. Welcome to the wonderful world of insurance companies where paying customers are treated like criminals and actual claims are considered personal attacks on their profit margins!
358. Lawyers cost more than doors usually, but right so, here's what works— ah, keep calling them daily, really daily, and ask for supervisors every single time.
359. That's what they're counting on! They've literally designed the system to exhaust you into submission— it's a business model based on human frustration tolerance.
360. Okay so, the insurance company's entire business model is, you see, collecting money from people who hopefully never need it, then when someone does, umm, making it impossible to actually get it!
361. Not really my scene, to be honest—I went to Vegas once for a conference and spent maybe twenty bucks on slots. The whole atmosphere is designed to separate you from your money, flashing lights and free drinks and all that psychological manipulation.
362. Sure, there's a dopamine hit when you win, but the house always has the edge mathematically. Every single game is designed so that over time, the casino profits—it's not gambling for them, it's just business.
363. Poker's different, yeah—you're playing against other people, not the house, so skill matters a lot more. But even professional poker players go through massive losing streaks because variance is brutal.
364. God no, that stuff is dangerously convenient—at least with a physical casino you have to make an effort to go there. Online gambling is literally designed to be as frictionless as possible, which makes it way too easy to lose control.
365. Oh man, that's rough—sports betting is [relieved] particularly insidious because it feels like you're using knowledge and strategy. But the bookmakers have teams of statisticians setting those odds, and they're not in the business of losing money.
366. That's the gambler's fallacy right there—chasing losses is how people end up in serious trouble. Your brain literally gets rewired to crave that next win, even when rationally you know the odds are against you.
367. No no no, I mean, you're not stupid at all—these companies spend, well, billions on psychological research to make their products, basically, as addictive as possible. They're literally exploiting how our brains process risk and reward.
368. Actually, I won, uh, fifty bucks on a scratch-off once and immediately, you know, bought dinner with it. Best decision ever because at least I got something tangible instead of just feeding it back into more tickets.
369. Ha, well, I guess watching my uncle lose his house to gambling when I was [flirtatious] twelve kind of killed any romantic notions I might've had about it. Nothing sexy about bankruptcy court, you know?
370. Sort of, I mean, he's stable now but it took, hmm, almost a decade to rebuild his credit and, basically, he still can't walk past a casino without his hands shaking. Addiction rewires your brain permanently, even in recovery.
371. Oh man, so, that whole project turned into, you know, this massive headache when the curator decided, um, halfway through setup that the entire concept needed to shift from abstract to literal narrative.
372. Yeah, I had, like, already mapped out forty-two projectors across three floors, and then suddenly, er, they wanted everything reconfigured for, honestly, this completely different storytelling approach with synchronized timelines.
373. Well, you smile and nod while, um, internally [shaky voice] calculating how many all-nighters it's going to take, and then, you know, you basically rebuild everything from scratch while pretending it's no big deal.
374. Contracts are great until you're dealing with [bored] prestigious institutions who know they can blacklist you from the entire museum circuit if you don't play nice with their whims.
375. The worst part is, well, knowing that the original concept was, hmm, actually [anxious] better but having to pretend their new direction is brilliant while basically, you watch your artistic vision get dismantled piece by piece.
376. They threw in, uh, an extra five percent which, you know, [cheerful] barely covered the additional equipment rental, but hey, at least I got to, actually, add another major museum to my portfolio.
377. Right? But here's the thing, in projection design you're, sort of, always walking this tightrope between artistic integrity and, well, keeping the lights on— literally and figuratively speaking.
378. Every single day, but then, umm, rent comes due and suddenly you're, actually, agreeing to project butterflies onto a ceiling for some tech CEO's daughter's, er, sweet sixteen party.
379. You'd think so, but those private events actually [confused] pay triple what museums do, and the clients usually just let you do whatever as long as it looks expensive and photographs well.
380. Welcome to the creative industry where your most profound artistic statement might get you exposure while projecting someone's Instagram handle in glitter pays your actual bills.
381. Actually no, I've been doing this for three years now, though watching these pros nail shots I can [jealous] barely dream of still gets me every time. Alright, we're starting at hole seven, par four, 385 yards to the pin.
382. The community here is incredible, and honestly helping anxious players stay focused is really rewarding. Next group coming through scored birdie, eagle, par on the last three holes.
383. I play every weekend when I'm not here, though my handicap is, well, embarrassing compared to these folks— sitting at about eighteen, honestly. Current leader is negative four through six holes.
384. You're sweet to say that, but, actually, when you're standing here calling out that someone just hit 287 yards straight down the fairway while you, basically, struggle to break 200, it's pretty humbling.
385. The way they read greens is almost supernatural— this morning's group averaged 1.3 putts per hole. But hey, being here helps me learn just by observing their technique and mental approach.
386. Oh, someone just chipped in from [sneeze] forty-two yards for eagle on hole five, and, you know, the crowd went absolutely wild— sounded like, actually, the Super Bowl for a minute there.
387. For us mortals, absolutely, but these players practice that exact distance probably thousand times a month. Wind speed currently at eight miles per hour from the southwest, by the way.
388. Years of practice and a really good notepad, though [bored] sometimes when it's the fifteenth group through the same hole, the numbers start blending together. Current pin position is back left, seventeen feet from the edge.
389. Most appreciate it because it helps with club selection, but, well, occasionally you get someone who thinks we're jinxing them— especially after I announce, kind of, their playing partner just went three under.
390. Temperature's dropped to 72 degrees which, honestly, is perfect golf weather, and the thing is, watching someone overcome that pressure to sink a twelve-footer for birdie, I mean, that's why I keep coming back here.
391. Oh god, well, you mean the forklift incident where, basically, Jerry almost got crushed because nobody, um, bothered to fix those broken safety sensors? Yeah, I filed three separate reports, and management's response was absolutely revolting.
392. They said it's not in the budget until next quarter, which is [regretful] disgusting considering someone could literally die. Meanwhile, they just renovated the executive break room with a sixty-thousand-dollar espresso machine.
393. I wish I was [joking] exaggerating, but no, it's this Italian monstrosity while we're walking around exposed asbestos in building C. The ceiling tiles are literally falling apart and releasing fibers into the air we breathe every single day.
394. Completely illegal, and the mold situation in the basement storage area is even worse— black mold covering entire walls while they store our lunch supplies down there. It makes me physically sick thinking about what we're exposed to daily.
395. I called them last week, hmm, but [clearing throat] the wait time for an inspector is, you know, three to six months unless someone actually, well, dies first. The electrical panels without covers, the missing guardrails on the mezzanine, the chemical storage violations— it's absolutely repulsive how little they care.
396. Yesterday I found out, actually, they've been hiding injury reports to keep their, er, insurance rates low— Tommy's hand got mangled last month and they, I mean, marked it as a minor first aid incident. The way they manipulate safety data while people suffer makes me want to vomit.
397. Eight pins and two plates, but according to, well, our official records, he just needed a Band-Aid, which is, um, so morally repugnant I can't even process it. They're literally trading our bodies for profit margins, and HR just sits there nodding along like accomplices.
398. Our union rep got bought off with a promotion to supervisor last year, now he actively discourages safety complaints. The betrayal is nauseating, watching him tell injured workers to "tough it out" when he used to fight for us.
399. The scaffolding outside doesn't even have proper anchoring, just held up with zip ties and prayers while workers are forty feet up. Every time I walk under it, I feel this disgusting dread knowing it could collapse any second.
400. Dead serious, and the most revolting part is they had a safety award ceremony last week, patting themselves on the back while we're one accident away from a mass casualty event. The sheer hypocrisy makes my stomach turn every time I think about it.
401. The correlation between your, um, [careful], migration anomalies and our cyber incidents is, well, [tense], ninety-seven percent accurate which shouldn't be possible unless, I mean, [trailing off], someone's using nature itself as some kind of communication system.
402. [urgent] Listen, um, I need you to understand that what you've been, [serious], innocently documenting for your dissertation might actually be, well, [lowering voice], the key to preventing the next major infrastructure attack, I mean, if we're reading this correctly.
403. [gentle] I know this is, um, [understanding], overwhelming but your observations about the electromagnetic disturbances affecting their navigation could be, well, exactly what we've been missing, you know? [sighs]
404. Your instincts were right though, umm, [validating], because we've detected similar electromagnetic signatures during every breach but never, well, [frustrated], connected them to biological responses like this.
405. [grave] Tuesday was when we detected the preliminary probes on the, [cautious], eastern power grid but nobody believed it was serious until the, [tense], actual attack happened three days later. [long pause]
406. [alarmed] Show me your tracking data from today because if what you're saying is, [desperate], accurate then we have less than seventy-two hours to identify and stop whatever's, [urgent], coming next. [exhales sharply]
407. [grateful] That's more data than we could have, umm, [relieved], hoped for and honestly you might have just given us the early warning system we've been desperately trying to, well, build for years. [pause]
408. [reassuring] You were documenting nature, um, responding to, [thoughtful], human interference in ways we never imagined possible, which means, well, you've been doing intelligence work without even knowing it, I mean.
409. [respectful] Your grandmother understood something that, well, [amazed], our most sophisticated algorithms missed entirely, you know? [soft laugh]
410. [sincere] This partnership between your observations and our, um, [hopeful], threat analysis might be exactly what saves lives, and I need you to know that, well, what you've been doing matters more than you could have ever imagined.
411. [defensive] Look, um, I had no idea you were, [uncomfortable], the daughter when I filed those papers, I mean, your last names are different and, [rushed], the estate documentation didn't mention, well, anything about the ice cream shop being, [trailing off], part of the inheritance.
412. Well, I mean, it does remind me of, [quiet], my childhood, but that doesn't change the fact that legally, um, everything has to go through probate.
413. [firm] Those conversations were real, but, um, my professional obligations and, [measured], personal feelings are two entirely separate things, you know.
414. [urgent] Listen, there might be a way to, [hasty], expedite the process if you can prove the shop needs, [scrambling], immediate operational funds to prevent irreparable harm to the, [breathless], estate's value.
415. [apologetic] I couldn't discuss it until I verified you were actually, [careful], the beneficiary named in the will.
416. [decisive] Then we file an emergency motion tomorrow morning at, [quick], eight sharp.
417. [rushed] I'll waive my fees for the emergency filing and, [softer], personally guarantee the judge sees it before noon.
418. [earnest] Because your mother's lavender honey recipe is, [emotional], the same one my grandmother made, and some things are worth, [determined], bending the rules for.
419. [regretful] Professional boundaries are just another word for, [weary], cowardice sometimes.
420. [gentle] Every day at two-thirty, just like, [hopeful], always, though maybe this time we can have an honest, [meaningful], conversation.
421. [guarded] Well, um, a person like me learns to, [nervous], see things without really looking, you know, because people forget we exist when we're, [bitter], holding a broom.
422. That night in October when the, [whispered], rain was falling so hard nobody could hear the, [trembling], screams from the east tower, well, I was cleaning the, [haunted], marble where the blood pooled.
423. [steady] My mop bucket was full of red water and the, [distant], generals were already practicing their speeches about tragic accidents while the real ruler's body was still, [cold], warm.
424. [knowing] The way you hold that scepter like it's made of, [observant], poisoned thorns tells me everything about how much you, [sad], hate what they've made you become.
425. [gentle] Well, I've watched you, um, slip food to the kitchen staff's children when, [warm], no one's looking, and I mean, a true tyrant wouldn't risk that kind of, [thoughtful], kindness. [pause]
426. [careful] You know, um, there are others who remember the truth, I mean, people who clean and cook and, [mysterious], tend the gardens—we all see things the generals think are, [knowing], invisible.
427. Then I'd say you're either about to, um, get us both killed or, [tense], maybe you're finally ready to hear what the previous ruler, well, whispered to me with their, [shaking], last breath.
428. [intense] They said, well, the real seal of office wasn't destroyed like, um, everyone believes, that it's hidden where only someone invisible could, [secretive], retrieve it.
429. [steady] Every morning for five years I've swept these steps, um, waiting for someone to ask the right questions, and well, today you finally stopped pretending not to, [meaningful], see me.
430. Meet me where the servants dump the dirty water at midnight—no one important ever, [cryptic], goes there. [whispers]
431. [quietly] I saw your name on the work order this morning and I, [hesitant], almost called in sick because I knew this would be, [trailing off], hard, but someone had to do the job and I figured, [heavy], maybe it should be me. [sighs]
432. [practical] Look, I know how this, um, looks, but the contract expired and, well, [resigned], nobody renewed it—I'm just doing my job here, you know?
433. [defensive] Well, um, not everyone can afford to chase dreams when there's, like, [frustrated], rent to pay and mouths to feed, you know, and this job, [steady], it keeps me grounded.
434. [barely audible] I remember everything.
435. [gentle] Because sometimes being practical means accepting that, [sad], dreams change shape, and maybe my way of honoring ours is making sure, [careful], you're not watching some stranger tear it down, [thoughtful], at least I can do it with the respect it deserves. [exhales]
436. It was never about it not being, [pained], enough—it was about being practical when my dad got sick. [silence]
437. Nothing could erase what you, [emotional], meant to me—mean to me still.
438. [interrupting] Don't.
439. [considering] There's space in my workshop where I store the old billboards, [slowly], and I've been thinking about converting part of it into something, [hopeful], more meaningful than just storage for dead advertisements, [meaningful], if you'd want to start small again.
440. [humble] Every sign tells a story of someone who tried, [thoughtful], and maybe that's worth preserving even when, [trailing], the trying stops. [soft laugh]
441. [cautious] Um, yeah, I mean, the production needed an authentic yacht and yours is, [measured], perfect for the scene we're shooting, so, you know, here we are.
442. [professional] The art department will be careful with everything, [firm], respecting the original design while creating the atmosphere we need for the film.
443. Um, well, that feels like, [distant], a lifetime ago, you know, before everything got complicated between us.
444. [tired] Well, you disappeared for three years chasing, [resigned], Michelin stars while she was dying, so, um, what was there to hear really?
445. But here's the thing that, [struggling], nobody talks about—she, [quieter], understood why you left, she told me, [heavy], before the end.
446. She said you needed to, [gentle], become who you were meant to be, that keeping you here would have, [sad], killed something essential in you, and she couldn't, [trailing off], do that.
447. [soft] Um, no, she was proud, like, really proud of what you accomplished, I mean, she kept every article about your restaurants.
448. [honest] Because I was angry and, [admitting], grief makes you do stupid things like, [quieter], holding onto resentment like it's the only thing keeping you afloat.
449. [whispered] We all made it.
450. I'd like that more than you, [emotional], know, cooking together in that galley again, well, like when we were young. [long pause]
451. [defensive] I don't, uh, know why they called you because I'm, [shaky], fine now, it was just a long week of back-to-back interviews and deadlines.
452. [barely audible] That's nothing.
453. I used to, um, paint every single day before I got into tech, and like, [trembling], it's been seven years since I even touched a brush because, well, [voice breaking], art doesn't pay the bills.
454. [bitter] Every day I schedule interviews for engineers who build things, [frustrated], create solutions, innovate, while I just move names around, [hollow], in spreadsheets and pretend that finding talent is somehow, [cracking], fulfilling. [exhale]
455. It was a UX designer's portfolio full of, [choked up], these beautiful interfaces and suddenly I couldn't breathe. [long pause]
456. [raw] My parents said art was a hobby not a career, [angry], and after three years of barely making rent, I finally, [defeated], gave in and got certified in technical recruiting. [voice drops]
457. [vulnerable] Sometimes, uh, when I'm sourcing candidates, I, um, imagine what my portfolio would look like now if I'd, [wistful], kept going. [tears falling]
458. [skeptical] How can I possibly make time when I'm already, [exhausted], working sixty-hour weeks?
459. [hesitant] I mean, I still have all my supplies in boxes in my closet, and, um, sometimes I open them just to, [longing], smell the oil paint, but then I, well, [ashamed], close them again.
460. [breaking] Um, I'm terrified that if I start again, I'll realize, well, [anguished], how much time I've wasted, how much of myself I've, like, [sobbing], given up for a job I hate, and, um, [gasping], I don't know if I can face that. [collapses]
461. [labored breathing] I didn't mean to, uhh, desecrate your sacred place, but the bandits were, [coughing blood], closing in and I just, well, ran until my legs gave out and now, [weakening], everything's getting so cold, I mean, colder than it should be.
462. [desperate] Please, I mean, I have a daughter waiting in the village who doesn't, umm, even know I left to find, [voice cracking], medicine for her fever. [whimpers]
463. [urgent] Then take it to her yourself, please, she's only seven and her mother, [gasping], died last winter from the same sickness.
464. [fading] What choice do I, er, have when my body's already deciding to, umm, surrender to whatever comes, [shivering], after breathing stops? [rattled exhale]
465. [hopeful] So you'll, um, help her then, you'll make sure she, [tears falling], gets the feverwort and knows that, well, her father tried to, [voice breaking], come back to her, I mean, that I didn't just abandon her?
466. Um, thank you, well, thank you. [gasps]
467. [peaceful] Well, that's beautiful, um, really.
468. [barely audible] Tell her, umm, tell her to look for me in the morning birds that, well, sing outside her window, because I'll, [final breath], find a way to say good morning. [silence]
469. [otherworldly] I can see the path now, glowing between the trees, and somehow, [amazed], I'm not afraid anymore.
470. [transcendent] The grove is singing now, or maybe, [wondering], I'm finally hearing what was always there.
471. [desperate] Please don't send me away—I know how this, [voice cracking], sounds but I have nowhere else to turn and time is running out. [sighs heavily]
472. [quiet] It's really happening and I've been, [ashamed], trying to find someone who would listen for three months but everyone just, [breaking], screams and throws me out before I can explain. [sniffles]
473. [hesitant] Well, um, the curse can only be broken by, [embarrassed], true love's kiss but, I mean, that's harder to find when you're, you know, covered in mucus and, [disgusted], smell like pond water. [groans]
474. Um, before midnight tonight actually, which is, well, [panicking], only four hours away and, er, I've already wasted three months being too proud to ask for help.
475. [bitter] My fiancée might have if I hadn't been too, [regretful], ashamed to go to her when this first happened—she probably thinks I abandoned her.
476. [defensive] Would you want the person you love to see you as a, [self-loathing], pathetic amphibian who got cursed for refusing to help an old woman cross, [guilty], a stream because I didn't want to get my new boots, [voice breaking], wet?
477. [ashamed] Um, I know how it sounds but, well, I was different then—arrogant and, [remorseful], selfish and convinced that, you know, my noble blood made me, I mean, [trailing off], better than everyone else.
478. [pleading] Please, I'll pay you triple your usual rate once I'm, [desperate], human again—I just need to look presentable enough to approach her. [whimpers]
479. [broken] But who I was inside was terrible enough to, [crying], deserve this curse in the first place. [sobs quietly]
480. [whispered] You're right—I should go to her even if she, [terrified], rejects me because at least she'll know I didn't just disappear. [croaks sadly]
481. [intense] Look, um, I know your father's newspaper has been, [bitter], attacking our movement for months, but well, you're supposed to believe in, [desperate], decentralization and freedom from control, I mean, isn't that what blockchain is actually about?
482. [pleading] Wait, just, um, hear me out—we need someone who, [earnest], understands the technology deeply enough to make this truly untraceable because, er, the opposition is tracking every donation and, [voice cracking], using it to destroy people's lives, you know?
483. [passionate] So, um, family loyalty matters more than, [pointed], actual people being silenced, well, persecuted for supporting what they believe in? [sighs heavily]
484. Yeah well, um, your mother also wrote that, [angry], technology should serve truth and freedom, so I mean, which principle are you, [accusatory], actually loyal to here? [pauses]
485. Um, well, define wrong.
486. [urgent] Well, um, of course.
487. [forceful] Listen, um, whatever comes next is happening with or without your, [pressing], pristine code—the only question is whether we do this, well, [determined], properly or if some amateur hack job gets people caught and, I mean, imprisoned.
488. You've already spent six months watching from the, [accusatory], sidelines while people suffer for their beliefs—how much longer can you, [pointed], pretend neutrality exists?
489. [solemn] The movement remembers its allies, even the, [meaningful], reluctant ones who finally chose courage over comfort when it, [quietly], mattered most. [pause]
490. [soft] Maybe, um, but sometimes the price of doing nothing is, [heavy], even higher, and well, I think deep down you already know that.
491. [defensive] Look, um, I work here now, so like, they assigned me to, [closing-off], handle the estate accounts because, well, nobody else wanted to deal with, [bitter], the complications of his treatment costs.
492. I mean, you think I wanted this, um, that I chose to be the one, [cracking], who has to explain why insurance denied, [defeated], coverage for the experimental therapy, you know?
493. Actually, um, there's something about the billing codes that I've been, [hesitant], reviewing since yesterday, well, something that doesn't add up right.
494. [measured] They charged him for procedures that according to his charts never, [careful], actually happened during his final week here.
495. [trembling] Well, um, I've been trying to protect you from this but, like, I found seventeen instances of, [whispered], fraudulent billing that total over two hundred thousand, you know? [sighs heavily]
496. [pleading] I needed proof before I could say anything because accusing my own, [nervous], employer of fraud while handling our father's estate could destroy my, [breaking], career and any chance of fixing this.
497. [firm] Stop it, Michael, just stop pretending you suddenly care about his legacy when you, [angry], haven't spoken to him in three years, not since you, [disgusted], chose expanding territories over being his son.
498. [gentle] He left voicemails saying he understood why you couldn't forgive him for choosing, [sad], the business over Mom's treatment, for making the same, [knowing], mistake you're making now with your own family.
499. [resolved] We fight this together like we should have fought for him, exposing what they, [determined], did even if it costs me everything, because that's what family, [warm], actually means.
500. [quiet] Well, maybe that's exactly why, um, we need each other now, because you know, [tender], how these systems work from the outside. [crying softly]
501. [shocked] They just... dissolved us. Just like that. Twenty minutes with some consultant who doesn't even know our names, and boom—department's gone. [pause] I mean, we knew restructuring was happening, but I thought—I honestly thought we were safe, you know? We hit every target this quarter. 

[confused] So apparently we're all getting reassigned, but nobody's staying together. Sarah's going to marketing, [upset] which is insane because she's a developer, and Marcus—God, Marcus has been here longer than anyone—they're putting him in, um, customer success? [bitter] Because that makes perfect sense, right?

[sigh] The worst part is how they're framing it like it's this great opportunity. [sarcastic] "Cross-functional experience," they said. "Career growth." [angry] We had something that worked! We had—[shaky voice] we had this incredible team dynamic, and they're just... scattering us like we're, I don't know, like we're interchangeable pieces.

[quietly] I keep thinking about our Monday meetings. The stupid jokes. The way everyone just... got each other. [long pause] I guess that's corporate life, right? Build something, watch it get dismantled. [exhausted] I should probably update my resume. Again.
502. [bitter] They gave it to Brad fucking Henderson. I mean, honestly, the guy's been doing this for what—three years? [laugh] Three years! And here I am with, um, seven years of experience, basically every certification you could possibly get, and I've been, you know, practicing play-by-play since I was twelve years old. [furious] Twelve! Recording myself calling games off the TV like some kind of—anyway, it doesn't matter.

[sarcastic] But oh, his dad knows the network president from their country club, so I guess that's what really counts, right? [short pause] All those nights I spent, er, studying game footage, memorizing stats, working local high school games for basically nothing—[trailing off] none of it matters when...

[upset] God, I really thought this was it. Like, the interview went so well, and they actually said—[shaky voice] they said I had the best demo reel they'd seen. [sniffle] The best! But here's the thing, um, Brad's never even called a full season of anything. [angry] Not college, not minor league, nothing!

[very sad] I just—I don't know if I can keep doing this. Maybe, uh, maybe I'm just fooling myself thinking talent and hard work mean something in this industry. [sigh] Twenty years of dreaming about this exact position, and it goes to someone who probably, honestly, sees it as just another job.
503. God, the irony is just... [bitter] I spent so many years, you know, hiding where I came from. [pause] My grandmother's dirt floors, the way she'd, um, save every vegetable scrap for soup stock—[ashamed] I used to lie about it at culinary school. Said my family was in, er, "agriculture." [sarcastic] Agriculture. Like we were some kind of wine estate owners or something. [laugh] 

But honestly, [slowly] everything on my menu right now? It's basically—I mean, it's her recipes. [warm] The bone broth that food critics are calling "transcendent"? [chuckle] That's literally how Nonna made it because, well, we couldn't afford to waste anything. [trailing off] The fermented vegetables, the nose-to-tail philosophy... 

[very sincerely] Last week this journalist asked about my "innovative preservation techniques" and I just—[gasp softly] I almost cried. Because it's like, these aren't innovations. [emotional] This is survival. This was, uh, this was shame. And now? [pause] Now people pay two hundred dollars to eat the way my family ate because we were poor. [relieved] And the thing is, I'm finally—[smiling speaking] I'm actually proud of it. Those dirt floors, they're... [confidently] they're in every dish I make.
504. [very sincerely] You know, twenty-three years in this business and nothing—nothing—will ever top that moment with Marcus. I mean, [pause] watching him walk into that press conference, finally getting introduced as head coach... [emotional] God, I actually teared up. This was a guy who, um, everyone said was done after his knee blew out. Thirty-seven years old, three surgeries, and they just wrote him off. But I knew—[passionately] I knew he had so much more to give! 

We must've sent, what, forty applications? [chuckle] Actually, probably more like sixty. Every rejection, he'd just look at me and say "next one, right?" [long pause] And then Syracuse called. His dream job. The school where his dad coached in the seventies. I remember, uh, negotiating that deal at three in the morning because [speeding up] we had to get it done before they changed their minds or went with someone younger or—

[clearing throat] Sorry, I just... [warm] That hug he gave me after signing? Twenty-three years of contracts and deals and millions of dollars moved around, but that hug from Marcus, knowing I helped him transition from player to coach, knowing his kids would see him lead a team again... [trailing off] 

[extremely happy] That's when you know you've actually made a difference, you know?
505. [bitter] We won. I mean, we actually—we fucking won. Twenty years of fighting and, um, the legislation finally passed. [pause] Everyone's celebrating, you know? Calling me a hero. [sarcastic] Hero. Right. [long pause] Sarah won't even, like, return my calls anymore. And the kids, they're—[voice breaking] honestly, I don't even know who they are now. [sad] Marcus is seventeen and I missed, what, basically everything? Soccer games, er, school plays, all of it. [frustrated] But the thing is—and I know how this sounds—but those families we saved, [passionately] thousands of them have clean water now because of what we did. [shaky voice] So why do I feel so, I don't know, empty? [regretful] Tom said I chose strangers over my own family. Maybe he's, uh, maybe he's right. [crying while speaking] I keep telling myself it was worth it, you know? That history will—[bitter] History. Fuck history. [very sad] Emma called me by my first name last week. Not Mom. Just... Linda. [whisper] She's only twelve. [long pause] We changed the world, and um, I lost everything that actually mattered. [exhausted] Some victory, huh?
506. [bitter] They let Sarah go yesterday. Twenty years with the company, never missed a deadline, and she's— [pause] she's clearing out her desk while I'm sitting pretty because I knew to laugh at Davidson's golf stories. [sigh] I mean, I saw it coming months ago when they started those "restructuring meetings." [quietly] Sarah didn't. She just kept her head down, doing actual work while I was, um, strategically grabbing coffee whenever the VP walked by. [regretful] Marcus got cut too. Best developer we had, but he never went to happy hour, never played the game, you know? [frustrated] It's not fair, it's not— [trailing off] but that's not how it works, is it? [cynical laugh] I started noticing patterns, like, who got invited to those informal "catch-ups" with leadership. [anxiously] Started making sure I was visible on the right projects, not the important ones, the ones that mattered to the people who mattered. [very quietly] God, listening to myself... [sad] Sarah trained me when I first started. She brought me homemade cookies when I was going through my divorce. [pause] And I just watched them escort her out. [defensively] What was I supposed to do, honestly? Fall on my sword? [bitter] They'd just replace us both. [long pause] I survived because I understood the rules nobody actually says out loud. [very melancholic] But I'm not sure what I've actually won.
507. [gasp softly] The brushstrokes, I mean, they're unmistakable—it's actually, um, it's really a Monet. [very slowly] Not a copy, not a forgery, but the actual "Garden at Giverny" that went missing in '74. [short pause] I keep staring at it and, you know, my hands are literally shaking because—[overwhelmed] this painting has been hanging in that estate sale for three days. Three days! And nobody, er, nobody else recognized it. [laughing] Can you believe that? 

[very quietly] The Rothschild family, they never... [trailing off] I guess they never thought they'd see it again. [excited] But here's the thing, I've got their contact information from, hmm, from that old provenance database, and I'm going to—[hesitantly] well, actually, I already called them. [warm] The granddaughter, she just, [crying while speaking] she started sobbing when I told her. Said her grandmother used to, you know, sit in front of this painting every morning with her coffee. [sniffle]

[passionately] Fifty years! This masterpiece has been, I don't know, floating through black markets, hidden in some—[angry] some thief's private collection, and now... [relieved] now it's finally going home. [very sincerely] That's why I do this job, honestly. Not for the commission, but for moments like, um, like this one.
508. [confused] Wait, hold on—these numbers can't be right. Um, let me just... okay so I'm looking at the quarterly report and it says we saved—[gasp] oh my God, THREE MILLION dollars? From my routing algorithm? That's... I mean, that's not possible, right? 

[slowly] Unless... hmm, actually if you calculate the fuel costs across all our distribution centers, and then factor in the, you know, consolidated shipments I suggested... [excited] Holy shit, it actually makes sense! The thing is, I just thought I was, like, tweaking some minor inefficiencies, but this is—wow. 

[laugh] I literally started this whole thing because I was bored one Friday afternoon! Just, er, playing around with the data, and I noticed these weird patterns that nobody else was—[pause] God, I sound so arrogant. It's not that I'm smarter or anything, I just... I guess I looked at it differently? 

[warm] You know what though, honestly, this feels incredible. Like, really incredible. All those late nights trying to convince management that we needed to, um, completely restructure our zones—[relieved] it was worth it. Every spreadsheet, every presentation where they looked at me like I was insane... 

[very quietly] Three million dollars. [cheerful] We saved three million dollars!
509. [warm] Look at that. Just... look at that finish. You know, um, when you first walked through my door three years ago, I honestly wasn't sure if—well, I mean, your hands were so shaky, remember? [chuckle] But this violin, it's... [pause] Maria, this is perfect. Actually perfect. The varnish, the way you carved the scroll—it's like, everything I taught you is right here, but there's something else too. [proud] Something that's entirely yours.

I guess, uh, this is how my master felt when I completed my first one. [nostalgic] Twenty-seven years ago, can you believe that? And here's the thing—I was so nervous I almost dropped it when I showed him. [laugh] He just stood there, really quiet, turning it over and over in his hands. Kind of like I'm doing now, hmm? 

[emotional] You're not my apprentice anymore, you know that, right? This violin—it's basically your graduation. Your, er, declaration to the world that you're a true luthier. [pause] God, I'm getting all—[sniffle] Sorry, it's just... you've worked so hard. And honestly, this instrument will sing for generations after we're both gone. [very sincerely] That's what we do, Maria. We make things that outlive us.
510. [upset] Completely unhelpful and discouraging? I mean, that's just—wow. Okay. Um, I really thought I was helping them, you know? Like genuinely believed I was making a difference here. [pause] Maybe I was too harsh? Or, no, I don't think—actually, was I? The thing is, I gave them the same advice that basically helped me when I was starting out, so I figured... [frustrated] God, I don't know anymore. 

They said discouraging. That word keeps, uh, bouncing around in my head. [quietly] Discouraging. Hmm, maybe when I told them their first draft needed work, I should've—but that's honest feedback, right? That's what mentors do. [defensive] I wasn't trying to crush their spirit or whatever, I was just being realistic about the industry. 

[sigh] Except now I'm wondering if, like, all my other mentees felt this way too but just never said anything. Oh God, what if I've been actively making things worse for people this whole time? [shaky voice] That's not—I mean, that was never the intention. I honestly thought tough love was, you know, helpful. My mentor was brutal with me and I turned out... [trailing off] well, I turned out how I turned out. 

[sad] Maybe that's exactly the problem.
511. [bitter] You know what the worst part is? She finally said it. After, what—seven years? Eight? She actually said, [mocking] "I respect you. You pushed me to be better." And I just stood there like, um, okay, great. [pause] That's what I wanted, right? I mean, that's literally all I wanted to hear from her. [frustrated] But then I'm driving home and it hits me—God, I spent so much time, you know? Every presentation, every meeting, I was thinking about her. How to beat her. How to, like, prove I was better. [trailing off] And for what...

[regretful] I missed my daughter's recitals because I was working late on proposals to one-up her. Skipped vacations because, well, what if she got ahead while I was gone? [shaky voice] My marriage almost—actually, no, it did fall apart. [sigh] And here's the thing, she probably went home that night and forgot about our whole conversation. Meanwhile I'm sitting here realizing I basically gave her my thirties. [very melancholic] All those years, just... gone. For what? For respect from someone who, honestly, I don't even like that much? [exhausted] God, I'm such an idiot.
512. [shaky voice] Oh God, oh no no no... they're already in. [pause] I mean, I was monitoring the traffic patterns all week and I—fuck, how did I miss this? [frustrated] The signatures were right there, literally staring at me in the logs from Tuesday—no wait, Monday actually. [regretful] Three days. They had three whole days while I was, um, focused on that other threat that turned out to be nothing. 

[anxious] So basically twelve thousand accounts, maybe more—I'm still running the queries but, [trailing off] Jesus, the credit cards, the routing numbers... [groan] Everything. They got everything. And here's the thing, I kept telling management we needed better intrusion detection, right? [bitter] But no, that wasn't in the budget. [pause] Well, guess what's gonna cost more than the budget now?

[very quietly] I should've seen the lateral movement in the network. Like, that's literally my job. [upset] All those families, their savings... and I was just, er, sitting here running the wrong scans. [sigh] The CEO's gonna—honestly, I don't even know what happens now. [mumbling] Probably lawyers, definitely lawyers. [long pause] God, I really fucked this up. [exhausted] Really, really fucked it up.
513. [shocked] I just—I literally cannot believe what Mom just told me. [pause] So apparently, um, Jake has been—for YEARS—telling them that I've been, like, [angry] stealing money from his wallet? And that I, er, broke his laptop on purpose? [stuttering] I-I-I never even touched his stupid laptop! [frustrated] The thing is, this explains SO much. Like why Dad's been so, you know, [confused] weird with me lately. And honestly, I thought—[very sad] I actually thought we were getting along better. [bitter] God, I'm such an idiot. 

[shaky voice] All those times he was being nice to my face, and then, what, just immediately running to them with, I mean, [furious] complete lies? [pause] Eight years. We've been a family for eight years and he's been, um, [quietly] poisoning them against me this whole time. [sarcastic] Oh, and the best part? He told them I was the one spreading rumors about HIM at school. Which is just—[laugh] I can't even. 

[exhausted] You know what though? I'm done. [determined] I'm actually done trying to, like, make this work. If he wants to play these games, then fine. [cold] But I'm not gonna sit here and, uh, pretend everything's okay anymore.
514. [exhausted] God, I actually did it. Every single case that deserved approval this month—I found a way. Um, thirty-two cases total, and not one denial that shouldn't have been there. [relieved] You know how sometimes you have to dig through like, pages and pages of clinical notes to find that one thing that justifies coverage? [passionate] That's what I've been doing. I mean, Mrs. Rodriguez needed that cardiac rehab, and initially they were gonna deny it because of some technicality, but I went back through her records and found the documentation from 2019 that showed—[warm] honestly, I almost cried when I got that approval letter. 

[sighs] These insurance companies, they make it so hard on purpose. But I've learned their game now. Every loophole, every regulation, I know exactly how to frame these cases. [animated] Like today, Mr. Chen's case? They were trying to say his physical therapy wasn't medically necessary, but I cross-referenced the new guidelines with his surgeon's notes and—boom. Approved. 

[quietly] I think about these people, you know? They're not just case numbers. [very sincerely] They're somebody's mom, somebody's dad, trying to get better. And I'm the one standing between them and the care they need. [happy] So yeah, this month? Not a single person who needed help got turned away. Not on my watch.
515. [exhausted] Finally. God, it's finally over—the treaties are signed, the borders are, um, settled. [relieved] Twenty years of bloodshed and it's just... done. [pause] I should be celebrating, right? Like, this is what we fought for, what I—[bitter] what I sacrificed everything for. [sigh] The thing is, when they bring you the evidence, when it's right there in black and white, you can't just, er, pretend it doesn't exist. [sad] Marcus wrote those letters himself, I mean, I recognized his handwriting immediately. [shaky voice] Twenty-three years we've known each other, and he was selling garrison positions to—[angry] God, how could he? [long pause] The council wanted execution, you know, they actually demanded it. [quietly] But I couldn't—I mean, exile was already... [trailing off] [regretful] His daughter came to see me yesterday, she's, ah, she's ten now. Looks just like him. [crying while speaking] She asked if Uncle Marcus really had to go away forever, and I just—[pause] what was I supposed to say? [bitter] That peace requires terrible prices? That being regent means, well, it means choosing the realm over your own heart? [very melancholic] The kingdom celebrates while I, hmm, I've never felt more alone.
516. [confused] They called this morning. Said, um, guilty on all counts. Just like that. After seven years of—I mean, depositions and, you know, lawyers and basically my whole life on hold. [pause] And I just... sat there. [quietly] Holding the phone like, er, waiting to feel something. Anything, really. [bitter] Everyone kept saying, "You'll feel so much better when it's over," and, well, here we are. [sigh] It's over. He's going to prison. [slowly] The thing is, I thought I'd feel—I don't know, victorious? Or like, relieved at least? [frustrated] But it's just... empty. [trailing off] All those nights I couldn't sleep, imagining this moment... [sad] I guess I thought, hmm, getting justice would somehow fix everything he broke. [laugh] God, that sounds so naive now, right? [very quietly] But the damage is still there. The years I lost are still, you know, gone. [hesitantly] And honestly, seeing his name in the news again just... [shaky voice] it brings it all back. [pause] People keep texting congratulations, like I won something. [bitter] Won what, exactly? The right to say I was telling the truth? [sigh] I mean, I always knew that. [very melancholic] Maybe justice isn't actually about feeling better. Maybe it's just, er, making sure it's on record. [long pause] That it happened. That it mattered.
517. [confused] Wait, what? The person in front of me just—did they really just pay for my coffee? [pause] And, um, the barista's saying they're covering the next ten people too? [whispering] Because of my smile? I don't even—like, I literally just smiled at them when they held the door, you know? [emotional] Oh my God, I might actually cry right now. 

[shaky voice] This is so... I mean, nobody's ever done anything like that for me. And honestly, I've been having such a rough week—actually, rough month if I'm being real—and this stranger just... [sniffle] They said my smile brightened their day? [laugh quietly] Me? The person who, er, basically dragged themselves out of bed this morning?

[warm] You know what though, this is—wow. Like, the thing is, I almost didn't even come here today. I was just gonna, sort of, stay home and wallow, but... [pause] [happy] And now these ten people behind me are gonna get free coffee too, and they don't even know why yet. [chuckle] They're all gonna be so confused. 

[very sincerely] I guess, um, sometimes the smallest things really do matter, huh? Just a smile. [trailing off] Who would've thought...
518. [shocked] Professional freeloader? I just—I can't believe she actually said that. [pause] Like, um, I heard her through the door talking to her roommate, and she literally used those exact words. [angry] Professional. Freeloader. 

Well, here's the thing—I've been helping out! I mean, I cleaned the bathroom yesterday, I bought groceries twice, I—[frustrated] whatever, you know? It's not like I've just been sitting around doing nothing. [hurt] I thought we were friends, honestly. 

[sarcastic] But apparently I'm just some kind of, what, parasite or something? [long pause] 

Uh, the worst part is, like—I actually told her about my situation. She knows I'm between jobs right now, she knows about the whole eviction thing, and she was all, [mocking] "Oh stay as long as you need!" [bitter] Right. Sure. 

So anyway, I guess I'll just—[trailing off] I don't even know where I'm gonna go tonight. [sad] My cousin's place maybe? Except, er, he's already made it clear I can't stay there again. [sigh] 

[very quietly] God, maybe she's right. I mean, this is the fourth couch I've crashed on this year, so... [pause] No. No, you know what? [angry] I'm not a freeloader, I'm just having a rough time. There's a difference.
519. [confused] Wait, what do you mean the union's—hold on, I'm, er, I'm reading this email again. [pause] They're dissolving the entire boom operators union? [shocked] And the pension fund is just... gone? [nervous laugh] This has to be, like, some kind of mistake, right? I mean, thirty-two years I've been paying into that fund. Thirty-two years of, you know, every single paycheck, and now they're saying—[angry] oh my God, embezzled? [shouting] Are you fucking kidding me? 

[shaky voice] I was supposed to retire in three years. My wife and I, we had—we literally just put a deposit on that place in Vermont. [bitter] And these bastards, what, they just took it? All of it? [furious] Every production I worked, every sixteen-hour day holding that boom over my head until my shoulders were screaming, and for what? So, um, so leadership could just—[trailing off]

[very sad] I don't even know what to tell Linda. She's gonna—[sigh] God, we're sixty-one years old. What am I supposed to do, start over? [exhausted] Like, honestly, how does this even happen? The thing is, we trusted them. [regretful] We trusted them with our whole future, and they just... [long pause] they just stole it.
520. [excited] We won! We actually—God, I can't stop shaking. [laugh] Three years since I walked out of that courthouse, you know, after my exoneration, and I thought I'd never want to see another courtroom again. But today... [warm] today we got Marcus home. Twenty-two years old, same age I was when they locked me up for something I didn't do. [pause] The look on his mom's face when the judge said "case dismissed"—I mean, that's exactly how my mother looked. [emotional] Same tears, same disbelief that the nightmare was actually over. 

[shaky voice] People kept telling me, "just move on, forget it happened," but how could I? Seventeen months I sat in that cell, um, knowing I was innocent. [bitter] The system failed me. [pause] But that's why I started this clinic, right? [confidently] Because I knew there were others—so many others—who needed someone who actually understood. [sigh] Our first case, and we did it. We really did it. [trailing off] I keep thinking about all the letters on my desk, all the people still waiting for help... [very sincerely] This is just the beginning. [emotional] Marcus is free tonight because we didn't give up. [warm] And honestly, that's all I ever wanted—to turn my worst nightmare into someone else's second chance.
521. [defensive] Well, um, I've been assigned to this district for, [formal], three years now so maybe you've seen me around, you know.
522. [stern] I mean, um, we should really focus on, [quickly], your employer's compliance requirements and not get distracted by, well, personal matters.
523. [bitter] Even if I was this Marcus person you're talking about, [regretful], what difference would it make after all these years? [sigh]
524. [apologetic] Look, I mean, um, becoming a probation officer was, [slowly], my way of making amends for things I couldn't fix back then, you know.
525. [whispering loudly] Please stop.
526. The guilt from that night when mom died and I wasn't, [anxious], there because I was too proud to come home after our fight has been, [exhausted], eating me alive for fifteen, [very sad], years.
527. [upset] Well, er, I blamed myself enough for everyone and, [monotone], changing my name seemed like the only way to, [trailing off], escape from the person who failed her when she needed me most...
528. Um, I mean, after all this time, [curious], what could she possibly have written that would change anything, you know?
529. [surprised] Um, she actually wrote that she was, [tearful], proud of me for walking away from her demands about law school, er?
530. [overwhelmed] I mean, um, fifteen years of self-imposed exile because I thought she, [broken], died hating me and now you're telling me she actually, er, understood? [sob]
531. [curious] Well, um, Mom said you'd want to explain everything about, [anxious], what happened and why you weren't there, but, like, I don't know if I'm ready to hear it all.
532. [defensive] I mean, for years I told myself, um, [bitter], that you chose whatever you did over being my parent, and, well, [frustrated], now I find out none of it was even true.
533. She never told me about the pictures or, [upset], the letters you wrote that she kept hidden in that box, [crying while speaking], and now I don't know what's real anymore or who, [quietly], I'm supposed to be angry at.
534. The kids at school, um, they all know about the case now and, [embarrassed], some think it's cool that you're famous but others still think you, well, [nervously], got away with something even though, er, the real person confessed.
535. [hopeful] Maybe we could start with something small like, [shy], getting coffee once a week or watching those old movies you mentioned in your letters. [chuckle]
536. [thoughtful] When I read your letters I could hear, [moved], your voice even though I'd never heard it before and that's when I knew, [confidently], you never stopped being my dad.
537. I brought the photo album Mom made of all the things you missed like, [sadly], my first day of school and learning to ride a bike and, [nostalgic], winning the science fair last year because I thought maybe, [hopefully], we could go through it together. [long pause]
538. There's this father-daughter dance at school next month and I've never, [wistfully], gone before but maybe if you're comfortable with it, [tentatively], we could try.
539. [excited] Really, because, um, I already picked out a dress and, well, [joyfully], told my best friend that my dad might actually, [proudly], be there this time, you know.
540. [smiling speaking] Well, um, I guess we should probably, [playfully], start with you learning how to dance then, because, like, Mom says you have two left feet. [laugh]
541. [defensive] I run my own installation company now and your parents, [bitter], hired us through the website without knowing it was, [concentrated], my business until I showed up this, [hesitantly], morning.
542. [vague] Well, um, it's more complicated than that, you know, [slowly], there were other reasons I left that had nothing to do with, [trembling], environmental activism. [sigh]
543. [warm] Um, I actually use my engineering knowledge every day, like, calculating load distributions and, [passionately], designing custom mounting systems for historic homes like this one, so, you know.
544. Dad made it clear that if I wasn't going to be, [exhausted], the lawyer he'd planned for me to become since birth then I wasn't, [very quietly], welcome at family dinners anymore and you were only, [mocking], fourteen so I didn't want to put you in the middle.
545. [releasing] You know what, um, I make more money now than most of those lawyers at his firm and I, [proudly], actually sleep at night knowing I'm helping people reduce their carbon footprint while, well, [cheerful], building something real with my hands. [laugh]
546. [empathetically] I miss you and mom but not the pressure to be, [stern], perfect all the time. [pause]
547. [apologetic] I never meant for you to inherit that burden but staying would have, [crying while speaking], destroyed who I really am and I couldn't pretend to be someone else just to, [formally], maintain appearances at charity galas and country club brunches anymore. [sniffle]
548. [relieved] Look, um, you're eighteen now and, well, about to graduate so maybe it's time you, [confident], made your own choice about college instead of just, er, [whispering loudly], following his blueprint like I was supposed to.
549. [excited] Um, well, that's amazing actually.
550. [joyful] I'd love that more than you know and maybe we can finally, [tearful], be siblings again instead of strangers who share, [soft], the same difficult father. [deep breath]
551. Yeah, um, I know.
552. Well, the thing is, um, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, [attentive], never once has a client worn a voice modulator to our meetings, which makes me, [curious], wonder what you're hiding. [clearing throat]
553. [slowly] Um, here's what I think—you're not just, [hesitantly], some concerned citizen with deep pockets, you're someone with, [bitter], a public face who can't afford to be connected to this, and I've already, [trailing off], figured out exactly who you are.
554. [mocking] Well, um, that's rich.
555. [confidently] It means District Attorney Morrison that you've been, [sarcastic], prosecuting criminals by day while hiring people like me to eliminate the ones who, [loudly], slip through your precious legal system.
556. Well, you know, the voice analysis software matched you at ninety-seven percent, and, [amused], that parking garage camera caught your very distinctive watch.
557. [cold] Interesting defense strategy. [laugh]
558. [thoughtful] The irony is that I actually agree with your, [warm], methods more than you'd think, but having leverage over the city's most prominent, [sinister], prosecutor is too valuable to pass up.
559. [casually] Actually, I'm thinking we could form a more, [calculating], permanent partnership where your legal expertise identifies the untouchables and my, [cheerful], particular skills handle what the courts can't, making us both, [very excited], incredibly powerful in this city.
560. Everyone has choices, Counselor—yours is whether you want to, [friendly], work with someone who already knows your secret or, [menacing], against someone who could destroy your entire life with a single, [whispering loudly], anonymous tip to the press.
561. [sleepily] Well, um, I haven't actually, [quietly], left this office in three days because the whole grid's been, [anxious], teetering on the edge of a cascading failure and someone has to, [shaky voice], monitor these systems constantly, you know.
562. [empathetically] The thing is that if this system fails, [warm], thousands of people lose power and water in the middle of winter.
563. [frustrated] Well, I mean, what choice do I have when the backup systems are, [slowly], failing one by one and corporate won't approve the emergency repairs because they're, um, [bitter], still reviewing the budget proposals I sent six weeks ago? [groan]
564. [very sad] Every alarm that goes off could be the one that, [trembling], starts the cascade we can't stop.
565. [curious] Why are you still here then, after your shift ended, [whispering], four hours ago?
566. [grateful] That data could help me, [hopefully], pinpoint where the next failure might occur and maybe, [speeding up], buy us enough time to get those emergency repairs approved. [laugh]
567. [animated] Are you saying there's a, [very excited], completely undocumented backup system that's been, [loudly], sitting under our feet this whole time?
568. [overwhelmed] This could actually work—we could, [frantically], stabilize the entire grid long enough to, [determined], fix everything properly without risking a blackout. [cry]
569. I haven't had anyone actually, um, [touched], offer to help in so long that I forgot what it felt like, you know.
570. After three days of staring at these, [wearily], screens alone, having someone who understands the stakes and, [thankfully], still wants to help feels like, [emotionally], finding water in a desert. [deep breath]
571. [caught-off-guard] Um, I noticed your daughter had, [hesitantly], exceptional talent and, well, she mentioned you couldn't afford lessons right now, you know.
572. She told me she's been, [quietly], begging you for lessons for two years but you keep saying, [frustrated], music is a waste of time when she could be studying something, [bitter], more practical.
573. [warm] Look, um, I just saw a gifted child who, [passionately], needed someone to believe in her talent, and, well, I couldn't just stand by, you know. [sigh]
574. [very sincerely] Your daughter cried in my classroom because, [crying while speaking], she thought she'd never get to pursue her dreams.
575. [very quietly] She's brilliant.
576. [empathetically] Because nobody else has taken the time to, [regretful], actually listen to her play or see past your constant, [exhausted], dismissal of her abilities.
577. [relieved] Um, you know what, I've already submitted her application to, [excited], the youth symphony with a full scholarship recommendation and, well, they accepted her, [proudly], based on the audition tape I helped her make, you know.
578. [apologetic] I mean, um, she needed this opportunity and, [anxious], I knew you'd never let her try, you know.
579. [whispering] Um, please don't.
580. [desperately] Um, just come to one rehearsal and, [pleading], watch her face when she plays with the orchestra, I mean, before you take this away from her.
581. [analytical] I mean, Dad, I took this call because, [hesitantly], the address looked familiar and, um, I thought maybe, [slowly], it was time we faced each other like, uh, adults instead of, [regretful], ideological enemies.
582. [calmly] Um, I left because we couldn't have a single conversation without, [frustrated], screaming about politics, and, well, I needed to find my own path away from, [exhausted], the constant fighting, you know.
583. [warm] Working with my hands taught me that, [passionately], broken things can be fixed without arguing about who broke them or, [empathetically], whose fault it is. [laugh]
584. [relieved] I mean, that vintage RCA you called about, [nostalgic], the one we used to watch baseball on together, um, before everything went wrong, [shaky voice], I can fix that if you'll, uh, let me try. [long pause]
585. [apologetic] The distance wasn't just about, [sad], our political differences, Dad.
586. [thoughtfully] Um, it was about needing to be seen as, [confident], more than just an extension of your beliefs, and, uh, finding out who I was without, [firmly], the weight of your expectations, I mean, controlling every decision. [sniffle]
587. [sincerely] Um, success looks different to me now, like, [peacefully], helping people fix what's broken in their homes instead of, uh, arguing in courtrooms.
588. [proudly] Well, um, these calluses represent honest work and, [enthusiastically], problems I can actually solve, you know.
589. [hopeful] Maybe we can start with the TV and, [gently], work our way up to the harder repairs that, [meaningfully], actually matter. [deep breath]
590. [moved] Then let's fix that TV together like we, [reminiscent], used to fix things in the garage before everything became about, [peaceful], being right or wrong. [smile]
591. [defensive] Well, um, I mean, you're not my dad so, [bitter], why do you even care what I'm doing up here, and anyway, [shaky voice], it's not like anyone at home even noticed I left. [sniffle]
592. [crying while speaking] Um, they're getting divorced and, well, they keep using me as like, [frustrated], a messenger between them and I just, [exhausted], can't take another night of them screaming through my bedroom door, you know?
593. [angry] The worst part is they both keep saying it's, [mocking], for my own good but then they ask me, [very sad], to spy on each other and report back like I'm some kind of double agent.
594. [curious] Did your parents ever stop using you as, [anxious], a weapon against each other or did you just have to, [trailing off], wait it out until you could leave?
595. [scared] I can't.
596. [monotone] Yeah well, um, easy for you to say when you don't have to, [upset], go back down there in five minutes, you know? [gasp softly]
597. [hopeful] You'd really help me practice what to say when they start, [nervous], their interrogations about what the other one said or did during, [speeding up], visitation weekends and all that stuff? [short pause]
598. Um, I don't even know why you're being so, [confused], nice to me when we've barely talked before but, er, [grateful], thank you for not making me feel stupid about being up here.
599. Maybe you're right and I've been so, [overwhelmed], caught up in trying to keep them both happy that I forgot I'm allowed to have, [determined], boundaries and my own needs matter too. [yawn]
600. [tired] I should probably go back down before they realize I'm, [reluctantly], gone and start another fight about supervision.
601. [patient] Um, somebody had to monitor the pressure gauges and, [slowly], keep the cooling system running or the whole thing would've, [shaky voice], blown up and taken half the neighborhood with it, you know. [pause]
602. [quietly] Just doing my job.
603. [exhausted] Um, twenty-three years I've been hauling these chemicals and, [bitter], this is the first time anyone from the government actually, [frustrated], showed up to ask what happened instead of just, er, filing paperwork and forgetting about us drivers, you know.
604. [confident] The thing is, politicians always show up after the, [sarcastic], crisis passes, when the cameras are rolling and the, [coldly], danger's gone, but you're here now while we're still, [hesitant], cleaning up the mess. [laugh]
605. Well, I don't need medals or ceremonies, I just need, [tired], better equipment and training for my crew so this, [worried], doesn't happen again, you know, um. [groan]
606. Politicians have been promising that for, [skeptical], years while we're out here with outdated gear.
607. [thoughtful] You seem different from the others who've come through, [curious], asking real questions instead of just posing for photos.
608. Um, I'm sorry about your father, that's, [empathetically], something we all worry about in this job, the long-term effects of what we're, [sad], breathing in every day even when things, er, go right, you know.
609. [hopeful] If you can actually get that legislation passed, it would mean, [relieved], everything to crews like mine who risk their lives every single day.
610. [genuine] Then maybe something good can come from this, [softly], nightmare after all. [deep sigh]
611. She's been describing every detail to me during our, [cheerful], afternoon sessions, down to the wallpaper pattern in the, [excited], kitchen where she made Sunday dinners.
612. Your mother lights up when she sees those, [very sincerely], recreations come to life on the screen. [laugh]
613. [hesitantly] Well, um, I taught myself the software during, like, [shyly], night shifts when things were quiet, and, you know, [friendly], your mom became my favorite test subject, I mean, storyteller.
614. [thoughtfully] I've been here three years now and, well, [confidently], I've learned that sometimes the best medicine is, um, [very quietly], just listening and helping them hold onto who they were, you know?
615. She remembers things like, um, [nostalgically], the squeaky third step and the way sunlight hit the parlor at four o'clock.
616. [proud] Every detail matters to her, so, I mean, [determined], it matters to me too.
617. The work isn't just medical care, you know, it's about, um, [empathetically], preserving dignity and, well, [warmly], keeping their stories alive for families like yours.
618. That would mean everything to them, and honestly to, [grateful], me too, because watching their faces light up when they, [joyfully], see their memories come alive makes every difficult shift worthwhile. [chuckle]
619. [touched] Absolutely.
620. Your mother always said, um, you worked in movies but, well, [smiling speaking], I never imagined we'd be doing similar work in such, I mean, [meaningfully], different ways.
