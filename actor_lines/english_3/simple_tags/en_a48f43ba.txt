Scenario: A vigilante meets the assassin they hired to eliminate a corrupt politician, unaware the assassin has discovered their true identity and plans to expose them.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervous] Um, I assume you've, well, reviewed the information I sent about the target and, [whispering], understand why this needs to happen before the election next week. [pause]

Character 2: Yeah, um, I know.

Character 1: [confused] That's it?

Character 2: Well, the thing is, um, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, [attentive], never once has a client worn a voice modulator to our meetings, which makes me, [curious], wonder what you're hiding. [clearing throat]

Character 1: [defensive] I mean, you know, anonymity is part of our agreement and, [stern], I'm paying triple your usual rate specifically for discretion.

Character 2: [slowly] Um, here's what I think—you're not just, [hesitantly], some concerned citizen with deep pockets, you're someone with, [bitter], a public face who can't afford to be connected to this, and I've already, [trailing off], figured out exactly who you are.

Character 1: [anxious] The contract we signed explicitly states that neither party will, [frustrated], investigate the other's identity or background, and violating that agreement, [shaky voice], voids our entire arrangement.

Character 2: [mocking] Well, um, that's rich.

Character 1: What's, [upset], that supposed to mean? [gasp]

Character 2: [confidently] It means District Attorney Morrison that you've been, [sarcastic], prosecuting criminals by day while hiring people like me to eliminate the ones who, [loudly], slip through your precious legal system.

Character 1: [trembling] Um, that's—I don't know what you're, well, talking about, but making baseless accusations against, [very quietly], a public official is dangerous territory, and you should, [passionately], reconsider whatever game you think you're playing here. [sigh]

Character 2: Well, you know, the voice analysis software matched you at ninety-seven percent, and, [amused], that parking garage camera caught your very distinctive watch.

Character 1: [desperate] I mean, look, whatever you think you know, um, there are larger forces at play here that, [empathetically], affect thousands of innocent people, and this target has, [worried], information that could destroy everything.

Character 2: [cold] Interesting defense strategy. [laugh]

Character 1: [pleading] Well, um, listen—Senator Carlisle has evidence of, er, human trafficking operations that he's using to blackmail judges, and the system, [angry], can't touch him because he owns half the cops, which is why, [exhausted], I had to find another solution. [cough]

Character 2: [thoughtful] The irony is that I actually agree with your, [warm], methods more than you'd think, but having leverage over the city's most prominent, [sinister], prosecutor is too valuable to pass up.

Character 1: You're going to, [defeated], blackmail me then? [groan]

Character 2: [casually] Actually, I'm thinking we could form a more, [calculating], permanent partnership where your legal expertise identifies the untouchables and my, [cheerful], particular skills handle what the courts can't, making us both, [very excited], incredibly powerful in this city.

Character 1: [resigned] Um, well, I suppose I don't have much choice.

Character 2: Everyone has choices, Counselor—yours is whether you want to, [friendly], work with someone who already knows your secret or, [menacing], against someone who could destroy your entire life with a single, [whispering loudly], anonymous tip to the press.
