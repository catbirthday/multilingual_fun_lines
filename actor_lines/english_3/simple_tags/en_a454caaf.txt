Scenario: A prep school student returns home for break to find a solar panel installer on their family's roof - who turns out to be their estranged older sibling who dropped out of their Ivy League education to pursue environmental activism.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Mom said, um, there'd be workers here today but she didn't, [shocked], mention that you'd be one of them after, well, [quietly], four years of complete silence between us. [long pause]

Character 2: [defensive] I run my own installation company now and your parents, [bitter], hired us through the website without knowing it was, [concentrated], my business until I showed up this, [hesitantly], morning.

Character 1: So you're, like, actually doing this now, I mean, [confused], the whole save-the-planet thing you dropped Yale for?

Character 2: [vague] Well, um, it's more complicated than that, you know, [slowly], there were other reasons I left that had nothing to do with, [trembling], environmental activism. [sigh]

Character 1: [curious] The trust fund would have covered your tuition for another three years but you chose, [frustrated], manual labor over finishing your engineering degree.

Character 2: [warm] Um, I actually use my engineering knowledge every day, like, calculating load distributions and, [passionately], designing custom mounting systems for historic homes like this one, so, you know.

Character 1: [regretful] I guess I, um, never really understood why you had to, [angry], completely disappear from our lives instead of just, well, [whispering], changing your major or something. [gasp softly]

Character 2: Dad made it clear that if I wasn't going to be, [exhausted], the lawyer he'd planned for me to become since birth then I wasn't, [very quietly], welcome at family dinners anymore and you were only, [mocking], fourteen so I didn't want to put you in the middle.

Character 1: [anxious] Well, um, he's been telling everyone at the club that you're, like, [embarrassed], in grad school abroad which is why you, umm, [trailing off], never come to any events anymore...

Character 2: [releasing] You know what, um, I make more money now than most of those lawyers at his firm and I, [proudly], actually sleep at night knowing I'm helping people reduce their carbon footprint while, well, [cheerful], building something real with my hands. [laugh]

Character 1: [shaky voice] Sometimes I look at your old room with all those, [melancholic], academic trophies still on the shelves and wonder if you ever, [very sincerely], miss any of this life we grew up in. [cough]

Character 2: [empathetically] I miss you and mom but not the pressure to be, [stern], perfect all the time. [pause]

Character 1: The thing is that after you left I became the one who had to be, [overwhelmed], perfect at everything and carry all of dad's, [bored], expectations alone which has been absolutely, [loudly], suffocating. [groan]

Character 2: [apologetic] I never meant for you to inherit that burden but staying would have, [crying while speaking], destroyed who I really am and I couldn't pretend to be someone else just to, [formally], maintain appearances at charity galas and country club brunches anymore. [sniffle]

Character 1: Maybe if you'd stayed and fought back together we could have, [hopeful], changed his mind about what success looks like instead of me being, [monotone], trapped in this predetermined life path alone.

Character 2: [relieved] Look, um, you're eighteen now and, well, about to graduate so maybe it's time you, [confident], made your own choice about college instead of just, er, [whispering loudly], following his blueprint like I was supposed to.

Character 1: [determined] Actually I already got into MIT for environmental engineering but haven't told anyone yet because, [nervous], I knew it would start world war three.

Character 2: [excited] Um, well, that's amazing actually.

Character 1: [contemplative] Maybe you could teach me about solar installation this summer before I leave so I'd have, [eager], practical experience to go with all the, [speeding up], theory they'll throw at me. [chuckle]

Character 2: [joyful] I'd love that more than you know and maybe we can finally, [tearful], be siblings again instead of strangers who share, [soft], the same difficult father. [deep breath]
