Scenario: An aquaculture technician meets with an art dealer who's purchasing their late father's rare fish breeding facility to convert it into an avant-garde gallery space.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] I got your message about viewing the facility, but I need to be clear—this isn't just some warehouse with fish tanks. [pause] My father spent thirty years perfecting the breeding cycles of these rare species.

Character 2: [warmly] I understand there's history here, and that's actually part of what drew me to the space. [curious] These tanks, the whole industrial aesthetic—it has tremendous potential for immersive installations.

Character 1: [frustrated] Installations? These are living ecosystems with pH balances that took years to stabilize. [sighs] The Platinum Arowanas alone require constant temperature monitoring and specialized feeding schedules that change with lunar cycles.

Character 2: [confidently] The infrastructure is impressive, I'll give you that. [quickly] But think about it—we could maintain some of the tanks as living art pieces while converting the rest into gallery space.

Character 1: [bitter] Living art pieces. [exhales] That's what you think they are? These fish have genetic lineages traced back twelve generations, documented in journals my father kept by hand.

Character 2: [empathetically] Look, I can see this means more to you than just a business transaction. [pause] What if we found a way to honor your father's work while still moving forward with the sale?

Character 1: [quietly] You want to honor his work by dismantling everything he built? [shaky voice] The filtration system alone is a masterpiece of biological engineering that keeps five separate species thriving in perfect symbiosis.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Actually, that's fascinating—the symbiosis aspect could be the centerpiece of an exhibition about interconnected systems. [animated] We could document the whole process, preserve the knowledge while transforming the space.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh perfect, turn forty years of aquaculture research into wall text for people sipping champagne at gallery openings. [clears throat] Do you even know what nitrogen cycling is, or how delicate these bacterial colonies are?

Character 2: [defensive] I may not know the technical details, but I know value when I see it. [firmly] This location, with its industrial bones and your father's story—it could become something meaningful to a much wider audience.

Character 1: [passionately] These fish don't need a wider audience, they need stable water conditions and someone who understands their breeding behaviors! [voice rising] The Discus pairs in tank seven have been together for six years.

Character 2: [gently] Six years. [sighs] That's longer than most marriages these days. Tell me more about them—maybe there's something here we're both missing, some middle ground we haven't considered yet.

Character 1: Middle ground would mean keeping at least half the operation running while you do whatever artistic thing you're planning. [hesitantly] But that would require someone with actual expertise to maintain the systems.

Character 2: [curious] And I suppose you'd be willing to stay on as a consultant? [chuckles] An aquaculture technician curating living installations—now that's something the art world hasn't seen before.

Character 1: Consultant implies I'd be visiting occasionally, but these systems need daily attention, constant monitoring, someone who can read the subtle changes in fish behavior that indicate environmental stress. [pause] Someone who actually cares.

Character 2: [sincerely] Then stay.

Character 1: [confused] Stay? You're buying this place to turn it into an art gallery, and you want me to what—feed fish while people take selfies next to the tanks?

Character 2: [excited] No, I want you to be the bridge between what this was and what it could become. [warmly] Your expertise, combined with artistic vision—we could create something that honors the science while elevating it to art.

Character 1: [uncertain] I need to think about this, about what my father would have wanted. [quietly] He always said the fish taught him more about patience than any human ever could.

Character 2: [very sincerely] Then let them teach us both. [pause] I'll postpone any renovation plans for a month while you show me what makes this place so special—not just the tanks, but the whole ecosystem your father created.
