=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I've been practicing this moment in my head for, [shaky voice], fifteen years but now that you're actually sitting here, [hesitantly], everything I planned to say just feels, [confused], completely inadequate.

Character 2: [curious] Well, um, Mom said you'd want to explain everything about, [anxious], what happened and why you weren't there, but, like, I don't know if I'm ready to hear it all.

Character 1: [warm] The hardest part wasn't the trial or the conviction, [regretful], it was knowing you were growing up without me, [passionately], believing I was guilty of something terrible.

Character 2: [defensive] I mean, for years I told myself, um, [bitter], that you chose whatever you did over being my parent, and, well, [frustrated], now I find out none of it was even true.

Character 1: Your mother sent me pictures every month and I kept them, [carefully], taped to my cell wall where I could see them, [whispering], every morning when I woke up and every night before I, [slowly], tried to sleep. [pause]

Character 2: She never told me about the pictures or, [upset], the letters you wrote that she kept hidden in that box, [crying while speaking], and now I don't know what's real anymore or who, [quietly], I'm supposed to be angry at.

Character 1: [empathetically] You have every right to be angry at the system, [gently], at me for not being there even though it wasn't my choice, [relieved], and at the universe for letting this happen to our family. [sigh]

Character 2: The kids at school, um, they all know about the case now and, [embarrassed], some think it's cool that you're famous but others still think you, well, [nervously], got away with something even though, er, the real person confessed.

Character 1: [sincere] Look, I know, um, I can't get those years back or, [exhausted], suddenly become the parent you needed me to be, you know.

Character 2: [hopeful] Maybe we could start with something small like, [shy], getting coffee once a week or watching those old movies you mentioned in your letters. [chuckle]

Character 1: [delighted] I'd like that more than, well, [emotionally], anything in the world because, um, I've already missed too much of your life, you know.

Character 2: [thoughtful] When I read your letters I could hear, [moved], your voice even though I'd never heard it before and that's when I knew, [confidently], you never stopped being my dad.

Character 1: [grateful] Every single day in that place I held onto, [trembling], the hope that someday we'd have this chance to, [tearfully], build something real together.

Character 2: I brought the photo album Mom made of all the things you missed like, [sadly], my first day of school and learning to ride a bike and, [nostalgic], winning the science fair last year because I thought maybe, [hopefully], we could go through it together. [long pause]

Character 1: [touched] That would mean, [overwhelmed], everything to me sweetheart.

Character 2: There's this father-daughter dance at school next month and I've never, [wistfully], gone before but maybe if you're comfortable with it, [tentatively], we could try.

Character 1: [happy] Yes, absolutely yes.

Character 2: [excited] Really, because, um, I already picked out a dress and, well, [joyfully], told my best friend that my dad might actually, [proudly], be there this time, you know.

Character 1: [determined] I promise you that nothing, and I mean, [firmly], absolutely nothing will keep me from being there this time, er, not after everything we've lost, you know.

Character 2: [smiling speaking] Well, um, I guess we should probably, [playfully], start with you learning how to dance then, because, like, Mom says you have two left feet. [laugh]
