=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled] Jesus, Danny, you can't just break into my studio at three in the morning! I've got pieces in the kiln that need checking every hour and you scared the hell out of me.

Character 2: [slurring] Wasn't breaking in when you gave me a key three years ago for emergencies, remember? [laughs] This counts as an emergency—Jake and Tyler finally had enough of my quote-unquote lifestyle choices and changed the locks.

Character 3: [frustrated] So you thought stumbling drunk into my workspace was the solution? There's wet clay everywhere, and you're dropping cigarette ash on my glazing table that took me six hours to organize.

Character 2: [defensive] I'm not that drunk, just had a few drinks at Monarch and then maybe some shots at that new place on Fifth. [sighs] Look, I didn't have anywhere else to go, alright?

Character 1: [softly] You never have anywhere else to go because you've burned through every couch in the city. [pause] When was the last time you were actually sober for more than twelve hours?

Character 2: [bitter] Says the person who hides in mud and fire instead of dealing with actual human beings. At least I'm out there living instead of making fancy bowls for rich people's dinner parties.

Character 1: [quietly] Those fancy bowls pay for this studio and, apparently, provide crash space for my disaster of a brother when his party friends get tired of him vomiting on their carpets.

Character 2: [shaky voice] That only happened twice, and the second time wasn't even my fault—someone put something in my drink. Why do you always assume the worst about me?

Character 1: Because every time you show up here, it's the same story with different names. [exhales] You're twenty-eight years old, Danny, not some college kid experimenting with boundaries.

Character 2: You think I don't know that? [voice rising] You think I wake up every afternoon feeling great about myself? At least when I'm out there, surrounded by music and people, I don't feel like Mom's death left this massive hole that nothing can fill.

Character 1: [very quietly] She died four years ago, and you've been running from it ever since. [trembling] I throw clay because it's the only thing that makes sense anymore, but at least I'm creating something instead of destroying myself.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] You got to say goodbye to her. [gasps] You were there holding her hand while I was passed out in some stranger's apartment because I couldn't handle watching her fade away.

Character 1: [empathetically] Danny, she never blamed you for that. [sighs] She understood you were coping the only way you knew how, even if it was killing me to watch you spiral.

Character 2: Every shot I take is trying to forget that I was too much of a coward to be there when she needed me most. The parties, the strangers, it's all just noise to drown out her voice asking where I was.

Character 1: [warmly] You can stay here tonight, and tomorrow, and however long you need. But you have to actually try this time—no sneaking out to clubs, no bringing random people back here.

Character 2: You'd really let me stay after everything? Even though I've disappointed you more times than either of us can count?

Character 1: [firmly] You're my brother, and this studio has a couch that's seen worse days than you have. Maybe being around something being built instead of torn down might help you remember who you were before all this.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Could you maybe teach me? The clay thing? [chuckles] My hands are pretty steady when they're not holding a cocktail, and I need something to do besides planning my next escape.

Character 1: [smiling speaking] We'll start with centering the clay on the wheel—it's all about finding balance and applying steady pressure. Kind of like putting your life back together, except with more immediate results.

Character 2: [hopefully] Maybe I could even make something Mom would have liked, something she could have put her flowers in. [pause] I think I'm ready to stop running, even if I don't know how to stop yet.
