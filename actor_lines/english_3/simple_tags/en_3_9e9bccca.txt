=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I couldn't believe it when I saw your name on the litigation notice, Sophie. [pause] After fifteen years, this is how we reconnect?

Character 2: [quietly] The Meridian Hotel sculpture that fell last month was one of yours, wasn't it? [sighs] The one with the suspended glass elements that you said would transform how people experience lobby spaces.

Character 1: [defensive] That piece went through three separate structural engineering reviews before installation. [firmly] Every single mounting point exceeded safety requirements by two hundred percent.

Character 2: [bitter] Tell that to the seven-year-old with permanent nerve damage in her left arm. [pause] She was a piano prodigy before your transformative art crashed down on her.

Character 1: [shaky voice] You think I don't replay that day every hour? [voice breaking] I've commissioned over three hundred installations and never once had anyone get hurt.

Character 2: [coldly] Your perfect record doesn't erase what happened to Maya Chen. [exhales] Her parents trusted that a five-star hotel wouldn't have dangerous art hanging above where children play.

Character 1: [desperately] The maintenance crew altered the suspension system two weeks before the accident without consulting me or the original installers. [quickly] I have the emails proving I warned them about unauthorized modifications.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Convenient how you're blaming the maintenance staff now. [firmly] My investigation shows you approved a budget reduction that eliminated the redundant safety cables from the original design.

Character 1: [quietly] That decision came from the hotel's board, not me. [sighs] But I should have fought harder against it, you're right about that part.

Character 2: [softly] Remember when we used to dream about changing the world with our careers? [pause] You with your art, me with law school.

Character 1: We were going to be different from everyone else in the industry, weren't we? [bitter laugh] No compromises, no selling out, just pure integrity and passion.

Character 2: [empathetically] I still believe in what I do, protecting families from preventable tragedies. [hesitantly] But seeing your name on this case makes everything more complicated than I expected.

Character 1: [warmly] You always were the one with unshakeable principles, even back in college. [quietly] I guess I'm the one who learned to bend when money talked loud enough.

Character 2: [firmly] This case is going forward regardless of our history, but I need you to know [sighs] I take no pleasure in this.

Character 1: [resigned] I know. [long pause] You're doing exactly what the Sophie I knew would do, fighting for someone who can't fight for themselves.

Character 2: [gently] After the deposition next week, after all the legal proceedings are done, maybe we could get coffee? [pause] Talk about something other than lawsuits and liability.

Character 1: [sadly] I'd like that, though I'm not sure we'll ever be able to look at each other the same way again. [exhales] Some bridges burn even when you're trying to save them.

Character 2: [very quietly] The girl, Maya, she asked me why beautiful things sometimes hurt people. [voice breaking] I didn't know how to answer her.

Character 1: Because we get so caught up in creating beauty that we forget it needs to be anchored properly. [pause] In art and in life.

Character 2: [tenderly] Maybe that's what we both need to remember going forward. [sighs] I'll see you at the deposition, and we'll take it from there.
