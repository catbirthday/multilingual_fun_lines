Scenario: A problem student doing court-mandated community service at a ski resort encounters the technician who was once their childhood skiing coach before a tragic accident ended their promising career.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Coach Miller? I didn't know you still worked here. [quietly] They've got me doing community service in the equipment room for the next three months, so I guess we'll be seeing each other.

Character 2: [warmly] Jamie, it's been what, four years? [pause] I heard about the trouble at school, the vandalism charges. Your mother called me a few weeks back, actually.

Character 1: [bitter] Of course she did. [frustrated] Let me guess, she wanted you to talk some sense into me, get me back on the slopes, remind me about all that potential I'm wasting?

Character 2: [gently] She's worried about you, that's all. [sighs] Look, I'm not here to lecture you about what happened or what you should be doing with your life, alright?

Character 1: [defensive] Good.

Character 2: [calmly] But I am going to teach you how to properly maintain this equipment while you're here. [chuckles] These edges won't sharpen themselves, and frankly, I could use the help with the holiday rush coming up.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Great, from Olympic hopeful to waxing rental skis for tourists. [quietly] My guidance counselor would say this is poetic or something, working with the coach I disappointed.

Character 2: [firmly] You didn't disappoint me, Jamie. [pause] That accident wasn't your fault, and quitting skiing after what happened to your friend, that was completely understandable.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Don't. [angrily] Just don't bring up Tyler, okay? I'm here because I have to be, not to rehash why I threw everything away after he got paralyzed.

Character 2: [empathetically] Fair enough. [slowly] But you should know that Tyler comes by sometimes, teaches adaptive skiing on weekends. He's actually doing really well, found his way back to the mountain.

Character 1: [confused] He what? [voice breaking] He's skiing again? After what I did to him, after I dared him to take that jump when the conditions were terrible?

Character 2: [gently] He never blamed you, Jamie. [sighs] In fact, he's asked about you every time he's here, wondering when you'd come back to the sport you loved.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] I can't do this. [shakily] I thought I could just hide in the back room, tune skis, and serve my time without dealing with any of this.

Character 2: [warmly] You don't have to do anything you're not ready for. [reassuringly] Right now, let's just focus on today, on learning the equipment, taking things one step at a time.

Character 1: [quietly] Do you really think he doesn't hate me? [hesitantly] Because I've hated myself every single day for the past three years, replaying that moment over and over.

Character 2: [sincerely] I know he doesn't hate you because he told me so himself. [pause] He said losing you as a friend hurt worse than losing the use of his legs.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] I don't know how to face him. [sniffling] I don't know how to face any of this, the mountain, the memories, everything I used to be before that day.

Character 2: [comfortingly] Nobody's asking you to face it all at once. [gently] Start with learning to edge these skis properly, and maybe, just maybe, you'll find your way back to yourself.

Character 1: [exhausted] Alright. [sighs] Show me how to work this edging machine, but if Tyler shows up while I'm here, I need warning, okay?

Character 2: [warmly] Deal. [chuckles softly] Now, first rule of ski maintenance: respect the equipment like it's going to save someone's life, because out there on the mountain, it just might.
