Scenario: A narcissist parent confronts their child's music teacher after discovering the teacher has been secretly giving the child free lessons because they recognized the parent's neglect.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [angry] How dare you give my child, [furious], free lessons behind my back without even consulting me first!

Character 2: [caught-off-guard] Um, I noticed your daughter had, [hesitantly], exceptional talent and, well, she mentioned you couldn't afford lessons right now, you know.

Character 1: [condescending] We don't need your charity because, [over confidently], I provide everything my child needs perfectly well on my own.

Character 2: She told me she's been, [quietly], begging you for lessons for two years but you keep saying, [frustrated], music is a waste of time when she could be studying something, [bitter], more practical.

Character 1: [stern] You have absolutely no right to, [loudly], undermine my parenting decisions or make me look, [trembling], bad in front of my own child!

Character 2: [warm] Look, um, I just saw a gifted child who, [passionately], needed someone to believe in her talent, and, well, I couldn't just stand by, you know. [sigh]

Character 1: [mocking] Oh please, you think you're, [sarcastic], some kind of hero saving children with your little piano lessons?

Character 2: [very sincerely] Your daughter cried in my classroom because, [crying while speaking], she thought she'd never get to pursue her dreams.

Character 1: [defensive] I work sixty hours a week to, [quickly], keep a roof over her head and you're sitting there, [shouting], judging me for not indulging every, [whispering loudly], artistic whim she has!

Character 2: [very quietly] She's brilliant.

Character 1: [confused] Well, um, if she's so brilliant then, [slowly], why hasn't anyone else noticed her supposed talent, I mean, besides you? [laugh]

Character 2: [empathetically] Because nobody else has taken the time to, [regretful], actually listen to her play or see past your constant, [exhausted], dismissal of her abilities.

Character 1: [jealous] You're obsessed.

Character 2: [relieved] Um, you know what, I've already submitted her application to, [excited], the youth symphony with a full scholarship recommendation and, well, they accepted her, [proudly], based on the audition tape I helped her make, you know.

Character 1: You did what without my permission, um, [very loudly], going behind my back to make decisions about, [shaky voice], my own child's future like, well, I don't even exist?

Character 2: [apologetic] I mean, um, she needed this opportunity and, [anxious], I knew you'd never let her try, you know.

Character 1: [bitter] Well, you can tell the symphony she won't be participating because I'm, [animated], pulling her out of your class immediately and, um, finding a teacher who respects boundaries, [enunciating every word], you know. [gasp loudly]

Character 2: [whispering] Um, please don't.

Character 1: I'm her parent and, well, [monotone], I know what's best for her future, um, not some music teacher with a savior complex, you know.

Character 2: [desperately] Um, just come to one rehearsal and, [pleading], watch her face when she plays with the orchestra, I mean, before you take this away from her.
