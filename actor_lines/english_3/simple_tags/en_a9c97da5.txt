Scenario: A john discovers his neighbor's tween daughter sitting alone on their apartment building's roof at midnight, clearly upset about her parents' contentious divorce.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [whispering] Hey there, I saw you come up here and it's, [concerned], really late to be on the roof by yourself.

Character 2: [defensive] Well, um, I mean, you're not my dad so, [bitter], why do you even care what I'm doing up here, and anyway, [shaky voice], it's not like anyone at home even noticed I left. [sniffle]

Character 1: [gently] Look, I know we're just neighbors but sitting alone, [worried], on a roof at midnight usually means something's really, [hesitantly], wrong. [pause]

Character 2: [crying while speaking] Um, they're getting divorced and, well, they keep using me as like, [frustrated], a messenger between them and I just, [exhausted], can't take another night of them screaming through my bedroom door, you know?

Character 1: [empathetically] That sounds absolutely awful and no kid should have to, [sad], be put in the middle of their parents', [quietly], problems like that. [sigh]

Character 2: [angry] The worst part is they both keep saying it's, [mocking], for my own good but then they ask me, [very sad], to spy on each other and report back like I'm some kind of double agent.

Character 1: [warm] Well, um, I went through something similar when I was your age and, er, the thing that helped me was, [relieved], finding safe spaces away from the chaos where I could just, [slowly], breathe and be myself without having to pick sides, you know? [long pause]

Character 2: [curious] Did your parents ever stop using you as, [anxious], a weapon against each other or did you just have to, [trailing off], wait it out until you could leave?

Character 1: Well, I mean, eventually I had to, [stern], tell them both that I wouldn't be their messenger anymore, um, and that was really hard. [groan]

Character 2: [scared] I can't.

Character 1: [confidently] Listen, um, you're stronger than you think and, well, [passionately], you have every right to protect your own mental health even if they're too caught up in their drama to see what they're doing to you. [deep pitch]

Character 2: [monotone] Yeah well, um, easy for you to say when you don't have to, [upset], go back down there in five minutes, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 1: [pragmatic] So look, um, what if we made a plan together about, well, [carefully], specific things you could say when they try to put you in the middle, and I mean, [friendly], practiced them until you felt comfortable setting those boundaries? [laugh]

Character 2: [hopeful] You'd really help me practice what to say when they start, [nervous], their interrogations about what the other one said or did during, [speeding up], visitation weekends and all that stuff? [short pause]

Character 1: [sincerely] Of course, and if you ever need a break from the chaos, well, [reassuring], my apartment is right below and you can come knock anytime you need someone to just, [kindly], listen without judgment.

Character 2: Um, I don't even know why you're being so, [confused], nice to me when we've barely talked before but, er, [grateful], thank you for not making me feel stupid about being up here.

Character 1: [professional] Sometimes the best help comes from people who aren't, [emotionally], tangled up in the situation and can see things, [clearly], more objectively from the outside. [clearing throat]

Character 2: Maybe you're right and I've been so, [overwhelmed], caught up in trying to keep them both happy that I forgot I'm allowed to have, [determined], boundaries and my own needs matter too. [yawn]

Character 1: Well, um, exactly that, you know?

Character 2: [tired] I should probably go back down before they realize I'm, [reluctantly], gone and start another fight about supervision.
