Scenario: A territory manager meets with their estranged sibling who became a financial counselor at the hospital where their father just died with massive medical debt.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervous] I didn't expect to see you here after, [hollow], all these years of silence between us, especially not in this, [trembling], office discussing Dad's medical bills when he's not even, [breaking], cold yet.

Character 2: [defensive] Look, um, I work here now, so like, they assigned me to, [closing-off], handle the estate accounts because, well, nobody else wanted to deal with, [bitter], the complications of his treatment costs.

Character 1: [confused] Six hundred thousand dollars in debt for three months of, [stunned], treatment that didn't even save him while you sat in these, [angry], offices calculating interest rates. [exhales sharply]

Character 2: I mean, you think I wanted this, um, that I chose to be the one, [cracking], who has to explain why insurance denied, [defeated], coverage for the experimental therapy, you know?

Character 1: [quiet] The house, the business, everything he built over forty years will be, [lost], liquidated to pay for dying in a sterile room. [long pause]

Character 2: Actually, um, there's something about the billing codes that I've been, [hesitant], reviewing since yesterday, well, something that doesn't add up right.

Character 1: Um, what?

Character 2: [measured] They charged him for procedures that according to his charts never, [careful], actually happened during his final week here.

Character 1: [desperate] So you're saying, I mean, someone at this hospital, um, falsified charges while he was, [disgusted], dying alone because we were too stubborn to be there, [voice breaking], together? [silence]

Character 2: [trembling] Well, um, I've been trying to protect you from this but, like, I found seventeen instances of, [whispered], fraudulent billing that total over two hundred thousand, you know? [sighs heavily]

Character 1: [furious] Jesus Christ, Anna, um, you've known about this for how long and, well, you're just now, [incredulous], telling me while I'm signing papers to sell his, [shaking], company, I mean, everything he loved?

Character 2: [pleading] I needed proof before I could say anything because accusing my own, [nervous], employer of fraud while handling our father's estate could destroy my, [breaking], career and any chance of fixing this.

Character 1: Well, um, your career matters more than, [bitter], Dad's legacy apparently. [laughs coldly]

Character 2: [firm] Stop it, Michael, just stop pretending you suddenly care about his legacy when you, [angry], haven't spoken to him in three years, not since you, [disgusted], chose expanding territories over being his son.

Character 1: [soft] He called me every Sunday from that hospital bed even though I never, [regretful], picked up once.

Character 2: [gentle] He left voicemails saying he understood why you couldn't forgive him for choosing, [sad], the business over Mom's treatment, for making the same, [knowing], mistake you're making now with your own family.

Character 1: So, um, what do we do now, I mean, about the fraud, about, [lost], the debt, about us standing here finally talking after, [exhausted], years of silence? [pause]

Character 2: [resolved] We fight this together like we should have fought for him, exposing what they, [determined], did even if it costs me everything, because that's what family, [warm], actually means.

Character 1: Anna, I mean, I can't let you risk everything alone again, um, not like I did when, [choked up], you stayed here to care for him while I ran, [whispered], away to sell medical equipment to other dying people's families.

Character 2: [quiet] Well, maybe that's exactly why, um, we need each other now, because you know, [tender], how these systems work from the outside. [crying softly]
