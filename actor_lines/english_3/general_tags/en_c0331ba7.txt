Scenario: A mysterious forest creature discovers a mortally wounded traveler who has stumbled into its sacred grove after escaping bandits.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [curious] Well, umm, you've stumbled into my grove, [tilting head], bleeding crimson onto moss that's been, er, untouched by human suffering for, [ancient], three hundred years, so I suppose we should, um, discuss what happens next. [clicks tongue]

Character 2: [labored breathing] I didn't mean to, uhh, desecrate your sacred place, but the bandits were, [coughing blood], closing in and I just, well, ran until my legs gave out and now, [weakening], everything's getting so cold, I mean, colder than it should be.

Character 1: [gentle] Your blood speaks of courage though your body, [examining wounds], speaks of endings approaching faster than the moon rises tonight.

Character 2: [desperate] Please, I mean, I have a daughter waiting in the village who doesn't, umm, even know I left to find, [voice cracking], medicine for her fever. [whimpers]

Character 1: [contemplative] The medicine you seek grows here abundantly but your vessel, [touching forehead], cannot carry it back in its current state of unraveling. [humming softly]

Character 2: [urgent] Then take it to her yourself, please, she's only seven and her mother, [gasping], died last winter from the same sickness.

Character 1: [surprised] You would trust a creature of the old woods with your most, [studying human], precious connection to this fading world you inhabit?

Character 2: [fading] What choice do I, er, have when my body's already deciding to, umm, surrender to whatever comes, [shivering], after breathing stops? [rattled exhale]

Character 1: [solemn] I have watched countless humans pass through these trees, [voice deepening], most seeking to take what isn't theirs, but you, [leaning closer], you offer your final moments as payment for another's life.

Character 2: [hopeful] So you'll, um, help her then, you'll make sure she, [tears falling], gets the feverwort and knows that, well, her father tried to, [voice breaking], come back to her, I mean, that I didn't just abandon her?

Character 1: Your daughter will receive more than, [mystical], feverwort, she will receive the protection of this grove for all, [oath-making], her days remaining. [wind rustling]

Character 2: Um, thank you, well, thank you. [gasps]

Character 1: [soft] Now, umm, let me sing you the song my kind uses to, [melodic], guide spirits across the threshold, because, er, dying alone in strange woods is, well, [compassionate], no way for a father's love to end. [begins humming]

Character 2: [peaceful] Well, that's beautiful, um, really.

Character 1: [singing softly] The trees are, um, already weaving your story into their rings, your sacrifice into, [reverent], their roots, and tomorrow when I walk to your village, well, I'll carry both medicine and, [promise-keeping], the message that you loved her more than breath itself.

Character 2: [barely audible] Tell her, umm, tell her to look for me in the morning birds that, well, sing outside her window, because I'll, [final breath], find a way to say good morning. [silence]

Character 1: [whispering] Your heart has stopped but your love continues forward, [touching chest], eternal as these ancient roots beneath us. [mournful]

Character 2: [otherworldly] I can see the path now, glowing between the trees, and somehow, [amazed], I'm not afraid anymore.

Character 1: Fear was never yours to carry into the next realm, only, [knowing], the love you planted in this world that will bloom long, [eternal], after your bones become soil. [blessing]

Character 2: [transcendent] The grove is singing now, or maybe, [wondering], I'm finally hearing what was always there.
