Scenario: An art therapist is called to help a technical recruiter who has suffered a panic attack at work and discovers the recruiter has been suppressing creative trauma from abandoning their art career.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [gentle] So, um, I understand you had, [careful], a pretty intense experience at your desk today, and well, your manager thought, [measured], it might help to talk through what, um, triggered this response. [pause]

Character 2: [defensive] I don't, uh, know why they called you because I'm, [shaky], fine now, it was just a long week of back-to-back interviews and deadlines.

Character 1: [observant] I noticed you have some paint stains, [curious], on your laptop bag that look pretty old, like they've been there, [knowing], for years. [soft smile]

Character 2: [barely audible] That's nothing.

Character 1: [probing] Well, um, sometimes our bodies remember things that, like, our minds try to forget, and I'm wondering if there's something about, [thoughtful], creativity that connects to what happened today.

Character 2: I used to, um, paint every single day before I got into tech, and like, [trembling], it's been seven years since I even touched a brush because, well, [voice breaking], art doesn't pay the bills.

Character 1: [whispered] Um, I hear you.

Character 2: [bitter] Every day I schedule interviews for engineers who build things, [frustrated], create solutions, innovate, while I just move names around, [hollow], in spreadsheets and pretend that finding talent is somehow, [cracking], fulfilling. [exhale]

Character 1: [empathetic] The panic attack happened when you were reviewing, [understanding], a portfolio, didn't it, because your colleague mentioned you were looking at, [connecting], someone's creative work when everything started spinning.

Character 2: It was a UX designer's portfolio full of, [choked up], these beautiful interfaces and suddenly I couldn't breathe. [long pause]

Character 1: [soft] You know, um, creative suppression is, well, a real form of grief, and your body was telling you that, like, [validating], something essential to who you are has been, um, [tender], buried for too long. [sighs gently]

Character 2: [raw] My parents said art was a hobby not a career, [angry], and after three years of barely making rent, I finally, [defeated], gave in and got certified in technical recruiting. [voice drops]

Character 1: [encouraging] But, um, here's what I'm hearing—you didn't lose your artist self, you just, well, [hopeful], put her in a very small box, and she's been trying to, like, [urgent], break free, especially when you see others living their creative truth.

Character 2: [vulnerable] Sometimes, uh, when I'm sourcing candidates, I, um, imagine what my portfolio would look like now if I'd, [wistful], kept going. [tears falling]

Character 1: [determined] What if we explored ways to integrate art back into your life without, [practical], sacrificing the stability you've built, because creativity and security, [reassuring], don't have to be mutually exclusive?

Character 2: [skeptical] How can I possibly make time when I'm already, [exhausted], working sixty-hour weeks?

Character 1: Start with five minutes of sketching during, [intentional], your morning coffee, just letting your hand move without judgment.

Character 2: [hesitant] I mean, I still have all my supplies in boxes in my closet, and, um, sometimes I open them just to, [longing], smell the oil paint, but then I, well, [ashamed], close them again.

Character 1: [firm] Those boxes aren't just supplies, they're a part of, [passionate], your identity waiting to be reclaimed, and ignoring them is what's, [direct], making you sick.

Character 2: [breaking] Um, I'm terrified that if I start again, I'll realize, well, [anguished], how much time I've wasted, how much of myself I've, like, [sobbing], given up for a job I hate, and, um, [gasping], I don't know if I can face that. [collapses]
