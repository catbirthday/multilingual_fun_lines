=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [cautious] They tell me you sweep these, [measured], palace steps every morning at dawn, watching everything with those, [careful], quiet eyes that never miss a, [trailing off], detail—

Character 2: [guarded] Well, um, a person like me learns to, [nervous], see things without really looking, you know, because people forget we exist when we're, [bitter], holding a broom.

Character 1: [soft] Five years ago there was a different person sitting in this, [hollow], throne room, someone who actually belonged here unlike the, [ashamed], shadow I've become in their place.

Character 2: That night in October when the, [whispered], rain was falling so hard nobody could hear the, [trembling], screams from the east tower, well, I was cleaning the, [haunted], marble where the blood pooled.

Character 1: [desperate] You were, [breaking], there.

Character 2: [steady] My mop bucket was full of red water and the, [distant], generals were already practicing their speeches about tragic accidents while the real ruler's body was still, [cold], warm.

Character 1: I mean, they chose me because I look enough like them to, [bitter laugh], fool the crowds from a distance, but um, we both know I'm just, [defeated], reading scripts they write for me every morning, you know?

Character 2: [knowing] The way you hold that scepter like it's made of, [observant], poisoned thorns tells me everything about how much you, [sad], hate what they've made you become.

Character 1: [whispered] Sometimes I wonder if you're the only person in this entire palace who sees me as something more than just a, [tired], convenient puppet.

Character 2: [gentle] Well, I've watched you, um, slip food to the kitchen staff's children when, [warm], no one's looking, and I mean, a true tyrant wouldn't risk that kind of, [thoughtful], kindness. [pause]

Character 1: Every morning I practice their words in the, [mechanical], mirror until my own voice disappears completely into theirs, becoming this, [empty], echo of power I never wanted.

Character 2: [careful] You know, um, there are others who remember the truth, I mean, people who clean and cook and, [mysterious], tend the gardens—we all see things the generals think are, [knowing], invisible.

Character 1: [urgent] What if I told you that, well, I'm tired of being their, [desperate], mask?

Character 2: Then I'd say you're either about to, um, get us both killed or, [tense], maybe you're finally ready to hear what the previous ruler, well, whispered to me with their, [shaking], last breath.

Character 1: They spoke to you before they, um, died—I mean, what could they possibly have told someone who just, [stunned], sweeps floors?

Character 2: [intense] They said, well, the real seal of office wasn't destroyed like, um, everyone believes, that it's hidden where only someone invisible could, [secretive], retrieve it.

Character 1: You're saying there's proof that could, um, expose everything—the murder, the coup, I mean, my own illegitimacy as ruler—and you've known this whole, [breathless], time where it's been, [frantic], hidden?

Character 2: [steady] Every morning for five years I've swept these steps, um, waiting for someone to ask the right questions, and well, today you finally stopped pretending not to, [meaningful], see me.

Character 1: [resolved] Then perhaps it's time we both stop pretending to be what they've, [fierce], forced us to become and start planning how to bring their, [determined], house of lies crashing down around their, [vengeful], heads.

Character 2: Meet me where the servants dump the dirty water at midnight—no one important ever, [cryptic], goes there. [whispers]
