Scenario: A packaging engineer must decide whether to heed the devil on their shoulder urging them to keep quiet about discovering their company has been using toxic materials in children's toy packaging for years.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You've been staring at those test results for three hours now, and we both know what happens to whistleblowers in this industry—they don't just lose their jobs, they lose everything.

Character 2: [quietly firm] The BPA levels are seventeen times the legal limit, and these are packages for sippy cups and teething rings that babies put directly in their mouths every single day.

Character 1: Right, and you have a mortgage, two kids in college, and your wife's medical bills aren't going to pay themselves while you're playing hero to strangers' children.

Character 2: How am I supposed to look at my own grandkids knowing I helped poison an entire generation of children because I was too scared to speak up?

Character 1: [persuasively] You didn't poison anyone—you just discovered it today, and honestly, these kids have been using these products for years without anyone noticing problems.

Character 2: Without anyone connecting the problems to us, you mean. The neurological issues, the developmental delays—God, we've been shipping this poison for eight years.

Character 1: [calmly] Think about Sarah's chemotherapy, how you almost lost your house last year paying for treatments, and now you want to throw away your only income source?

Character 2: [voice breaking] Every package I designed has my initials in the corner code, my signature saying it's safe, and now I know it's been slowly hurting children this whole time.

Character 1: [insistent] Those initials mean nothing legally—you were following approved specifications from management, doing your job exactly as instructed, completely protected from liability.

Character 2: Protected from lawsuits maybe, but not from knowing that Tommy Harrison's autism might be because his mom bought our bottles. [exhales heavily] I went to school with his dad.

Character 1: [smoothly] Correlation isn't causation, and you're not a medical expert qualified to make those connections—you're an engineer who needs to stay in his lane.

Character 2: [firmly] I'm done.

Character 1: [urgently] Listen, if you report this, they'll bury you in legal proceedings, claim you falsified data for attention, destroy your reputation so thoroughly no one will ever hire you again.

Character 2: Maybe they will, but at least I'll be able to sleep at night knowing no more kids will get sick from something I could have stopped.

Character 1: [darkly] Your noble sacrifice won't change anything—they'll find another engineer within a week, one who keeps quiet, and production continues while you lose everything.

Character 2: [resolute] I'm copying these files to three different drives and sending them to the FDA, the press, and the consumer protection board tonight. [pause] We're done here.

Character 1: [desperately] You're throwing away twenty-three years of career building, your entire professional network, your family's security, all for people who will never even know your name!

Character 2: That's the thing about doing the right thing—it's not about recognition or reward, it's about being able to face yourself in the mirror.

Character 1: [bitterly] Hope that reflection keeps you warm when you're living in your car and your wife leaves you for destroying the life you built together.

Character 2: Sarah would leave me if I stayed silent. She didn't survive cancer to be married to a coward who values comfort over children's lives. Goodbye.
