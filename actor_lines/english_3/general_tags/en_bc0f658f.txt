Scenario: A bookworm who owns a struggling independent bookstore discovers the billboard installer removing their store's last advertisement is their childhood best friend who taught them to read.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [stunned] Wait, is that really you up there taking down my, [voice breaking], billboard—the last advertisement for my bookstore?

Character 2: [quietly] I saw your name on the work order this morning and I, [hesitant], almost called in sick because I knew this would be, [trailing off], hard, but someone had to do the job and I figured, [heavy], maybe it should be me. [sighs]

Character 1: You taught me to read, um, sitting on your porch with those, [nostalgic], old paperbacks your mom collected, and now you're, well, [bitter], literally dismantling the last sign that my bookstore even, [choking up], exists in this town. [long pause]

Character 2: [practical] Look, I know how this, um, looks, but the contract expired and, well, [resigned], nobody renewed it—I'm just doing my job here, you know?

Character 1: [desperate] Your job is taking down dreams now, [accusatory], the same hands that opened books for me are now, [broken], closing the last chapter of everything I built after you, [trailing], left for trade school.

Character 2: [defensive] Well, um, not everyone can afford to chase dreams when there's, like, [frustrated], rent to pay and mouths to feed, you know, and this job, [steady], it keeps me grounded.

Character 1: [soft] Remember when we swore we'd open a bookstore together, [wistful], right here on Main Street with a reading nook and, [trembling], weekly poetry nights where anyone could share their words without, [distant], fear of judgment?

Character 2: [barely audible] I remember everything.

Character 1: Then why, um, are you up there with your tools, [hurt], removing the last trace of what we, well, dreamed about?

Character 2: [gentle] Because sometimes being practical means accepting that, [sad], dreams change shape, and maybe my way of honoring ours is making sure, [careful], you're not watching some stranger tear it down, [thoughtful], at least I can do it with the respect it deserves. [exhales]

Character 1: [crying] Every book in that store has your fingerprints somewhere, [shaking], from when you helped me paint the shelves to the, [remembering], inventory system you designed on napkins at the diner before you, [hollow], decided this life wasn't enough.

Character 2: It was never about it not being, [pained], enough—it was about being practical when my dad got sick. [silence]

Character 1: [humble] I know you made the right choice for your family and I've never, [guilty], held that against you, but watching you remove that sign feels like, [overwhelmed], you're erasing us from existence, from everything we, [lost], were to each other.

Character 2: Nothing could erase what you, [emotional], meant to me—mean to me still.

Character 1: [hopeful] Well, um, then maybe—[pauses]

Character 2: [interrupting] Don't.

Character 1: Maybe you could, um, help me one more time, not with, [tentative], dreams this time but with something practical like, well, [searching], finding a way to keep just one small shelf of books, [pleading], somewhere in this town?

Character 2: [considering] There's space in my workshop where I store the old billboards, [slowly], and I've been thinking about converting part of it into something, [hopeful], more meaningful than just storage for dead advertisements, [meaningful], if you'd want to start small again.

Character 1: You kept the old billboards, [surprised], all these years of taking down people's dreams and you, [understanding], kept them because you couldn't let go either, [tender], could you?

Character 2: [humble] Every sign tells a story of someone who tried, [thoughtful], and maybe that's worth preserving even when, [trailing], the trying stops. [soft laugh]
