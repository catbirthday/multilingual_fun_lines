=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I've, um, pulled up your offer letter and honestly, Rachel, this base salary is lower than what someone with your experience should be getting, especially in this market. [concerned pause]

Character 2: [defensive] Well, I haven't exactly been working for the past three years, you know? I was basically, err, supporting David's career while he climbed the ladder at his firm.

Character 1: [gently] That's still experience though—managing a household, coordinating schedules, I mean, those are transferable skills that, uh, companies actually value now more than they used to.

Character 2: [bitterly] Try explaining that to a hiring manager when your resume has a giant gap and your ex-husband's lawyer is arguing you don't need spousal support because you're 'employable.'

Character 1: Look, the equity package they're offering is actually pretty solid, and if we, um, if we negotiate the signing bonus up by maybe fifteen thousand, that could offset the lower base for the first year. [shuffles papers]

Character 2: Fifteen thousand? That's, I mean, that sounds like a lot to ask for when I'm already grateful they're even considering me after being out of the workforce.

Character 1: [firmly] Rachel, you need to stop thinking like that—this company needs your skillset, okay? They wouldn't have made an offer if they didn't see value in what you bring.

Character 2: [voice cracking] It's just hard to, uh, to see my own value when David spent the last five years telling me I was lucky he was supporting me. [exhales shakily]

Character 1: [warmly] Hey, remember in college when you negotiated our entire group into that, err, that impossible internship program? You were fearless back then.

Character 2: That was different though—I wasn't, um, I wasn't broken and starting over at forty-two with two kids depending on me. [quiet laugh]

Character 1: You're not broken, you're navigating something incredibly difficult, and, [sighs], honestly you're doing it with more grace than most people would manage.

Character 2: [growing stronger] The health benefits kick in immediately, right? Because Tommy needs his asthma medication and I can't afford another month of COBRA payments.

Character 1: [reassuring] Yes, day one coverage.

Character 2: [determined] Then let's do it—let's counter with the fifteen thousand signing bonus and, um, maybe ask for an accelerated review cycle so I can prove myself faster.

Character 1: [excited] Now that's the Rachel I remember! We'll also request flexible hours for the first ninety days while you get childcare sorted—that's completely reasonable. [typing rapidly]

Character 2: God, I haven't felt this, err, hopeful isn't the right word, but maybe... capable? I haven't felt capable in so long.

Character 1: [softly] You've always been capable, Rach, you just needed someone to remind you of what you're worth in actual numbers.

Character 2: Thank you for, um, for not judging me when I called you crying last week about all this—I know we hadn't talked in years. [sniffles]

Character 1: Are you kidding? You sat with me through my mom's entire chemo treatment senior year, so helping you navigate this is, uh, it's the least I can do.

Character 2: [tearful smile in voice] Okay, let's send this counter-offer before I lose my nerve—and maybe, um, maybe we can make our coffee dates a regular thing again? [hopeful]
