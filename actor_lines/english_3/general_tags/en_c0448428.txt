Scenario: A pet groomer discovers that the unusual frog brought in for 'grooming' is actually a cursed prince who has only until midnight to convince someone to kiss him.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled] Um, I've groomed a lot of, [confused], unusual pets in my fifteen years but, well, I mean, I've never had someone bring me a, [trembling], frog claiming it needs, you know, professional grooming services.

Character 2: [desperate] Please don't send me away—I know how this, [voice cracking], sounds but I have nowhere else to turn and time is running out. [sighs heavily]

Character 1: [skeptical] You're, um, actually speaking to me right now, I mean, like a frog is, [overwhelmed], forming actual words and I'm either having a breakdown or, well, [shaking], this is really happening. [laughs nervously]

Character 2: [quiet] It's really happening and I've been, [ashamed], trying to find someone who would listen for three months but everyone just, [breaking], screams and throws me out before I can explain. [sniffles]

Character 1: [softening] Okay, let's say I believe you're not just a hallucination from, [careful], too much flea shampoo exposure—what exactly do you need from me?

Character 2: [hesitant] Well, um, the curse can only be broken by, [embarrassed], true love's kiss but, I mean, that's harder to find when you're, you know, covered in mucus and, [disgusted], smell like pond water. [groans]

Character 1: You want me to, [incredulous], groom you so you can convince someone to kiss you before what—before you're stuck forever?

Character 2: Um, before midnight tonight actually, which is, well, [panicking], only four hours away and, er, I've already wasted three months being too proud to ask for help.

Character 1: I mean, even if I could make you, [doubtful], presentable somehow, um, who's going to kiss a frog just because it's, well, [sad], clean and maybe wearing a tiny bow tie or something?

Character 2: [bitter] My fiancée might have if I hadn't been too, [regretful], ashamed to go to her when this first happened—she probably thinks I abandoned her.

Character 1: [gentle] Wait, you had someone who loved you and you've been, [disbelieving], hiding from them all this time instead of just, [frustrated], telling them the truth about what happened? [exhales sharply]

Character 2: [defensive] Would you want the person you love to see you as a, [self-loathing], pathetic amphibian who got cursed for refusing to help an old woman cross, [guilty], a stream because I didn't want to get my new boots, [voice breaking], wet?

Character 1: That's what caused this—you wouldn't, [stunned], help someone because of your boots? [laughs bitterly]

Character 2: [ashamed] Um, I know how it sounds but, well, I was different then—arrogant and, [remorseful], selfish and convinced that, you know, my noble blood made me, I mean, [trailing off], better than everyone else.

Character 1: [hollow] Well, um, I mean, maybe.

Character 2: [pleading] Please, I'll pay you triple your usual rate once I'm, [desperate], human again—I just need to look presentable enough to approach her. [whimpers]

Character 1: You know what's really, [angry], sad is that you still think this is about how you look when clearly she loved you for, [disappointed], who you were inside.

Character 2: [broken] But who I was inside was terrible enough to, [crying], deserve this curse in the first place. [sobs quietly]

Character 1: Maybe the real curse isn't being a frog but being too, [weary], afraid to let the people who love you see you at your worst. [sighs deeply]

Character 2: [whispered] You're right—I should go to her even if she, [terrified], rejects me because at least she'll know I didn't just disappear. [croaks sadly]
