Subject: Your immigrant neighbor asking you to be their citizenship ceremony witness because you helped them practice English

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I have something important to ask you. [hesitantly] You know my citizenship ceremony is next month, yes? [pause] I need witness for this ceremony, someone who knows me, who can say I am... good person for America. [warm] And I think of you immediately. [emotionally] You remember when I first moved here, my English was so terrible. [laugh] I couldn't even order coffee without pointing at menu! [gratefully] But you never made fun of me. Every Tuesday, you sit with me on your porch, we practice conversation. [smiling speaking] You correct my grammar so patiently, never getting frustrated when I mix up past and present tense for hundredth time. [very sincerely] You taught me not just English, but how to belong here. [sniffle] When my mother was sick and I had to explain to doctors on phone, you stayed with me, helping me find right words. [passionately] This is what America means to me—neighbors who become family! [excited] So will you be my witness? [anxiously] I know it's big thing to ask, taking time from work, but, um... it would mean everything. [hopefully] My children will be there, and they always ask about "the nice neighbor who teaches Papa funny expressions." [laugh] They still giggle when I say "piece of cake!"
