[bitter] Oh my God, I can't—this is why they've been so weird with me. [sigh] All those times Mom would get that look on her face when I'd mention, um... when I'd mention getting promoted or dating someone new. [furious] That absolute snake! [pause] And Dad being all distant at Christmas, asking if I was \"really happy\" with my choices—that was him? [crying while speaking] I thought we were good. I mean, we're not best friends but I thought... I don't know, I thought we had each other's backs at least. [angry] Five years of this? Five years of him just, what, poisoning them against me? [long pause] [very sad] God, no wonder they never visit me anymore. They probably think I'm some kind of... I don't even know what he's been telling them. [frustrated] And he just sits there at family dinners, smiling at me like—ugh! [sarcastic] \"Hey sis, pass the potatoes\" while he's been systematically destroying my relationship with them. [whispering] How did I not see this? [upset] Actually, you know what? Screw him. [confidently] I'm calling Mom right now and we're sorting this out."
