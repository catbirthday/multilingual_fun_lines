Subject: Your regent duties finally bringing peace to the region, but requiring you to exile your closest friend for treason

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] Finally. God, it's finally over—the treaties are signed, the borders are, um, settled. [relieved] Twenty years of bloodshed and it's just... done. [pause] I should be celebrating, right? Like, this is what we fought for, what I—[bitter] what I sacrificed everything for. [sigh] The thing is, when they bring you the evidence, when it's right there in black and white, you can't just, er, pretend it doesn't exist. [sad] Marcus wrote those letters himself, I mean, I recognized his handwriting immediately. [shaky voice] Twenty-three years we've known each other, and he was selling garrison positions to—[angry] God, how could he? [long pause] The council wanted execution, you know, they actually demanded it. [quietly] But I couldn't—I mean, exile was already... [trailing off] [regretful] His daughter came to see me yesterday, she's, ah, she's ten now. Looks just like him. [crying while speaking] She asked if Uncle Marcus really had to go away forever, and I just—[pause] what was I supposed to say? [bitter] That peace requires terrible prices? That being regent means, well, it means choosing the realm over your own heart? [very melancholic] The kingdom celebrates while I, hmm, I've never felt more alone.
