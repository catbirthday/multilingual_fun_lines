[pause] I mean, we knew restructuring was happening, but I thought—I honestly thought we were safe, you know? We hit every target this quarter. \n\n[confused] So apparently we're all getting reassigned, but nobody's staying together. Sarah's going to marketing, [upset] which is insane because she's a developer, and Marcus—God, Marcus has been here longer than anyone—they're putting him in, um, customer success? [bitter] Because that makes perfect sense, right?\n\n[sigh] The worst part is how they're framing it like it's this great opportunity. [sarcastic] \"Cross-functional experience,\" they said. \"Career growth.\" [angry] We had something that worked! We had—[shaky voice] we had this incredible team dynamic, and they're just... scattering us like we're, I don't know, like we're interchangeable pieces.\n\n[quietly] I keep thinking about our Monday meetings. The stupid jokes. The way everyone just... got each other. [long pause] I guess that's corporate life, right? Build something, watch it get dismantled. [exhausted] I should probably update my resume. Again."
