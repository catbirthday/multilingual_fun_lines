Subject: The peasant roots you were ashamed of just became the foundation for your successful farm-to-table restaurant

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: God, the irony is just... [bitter] I spent so many years, you know, hiding where I came from. [pause] My grandmother's dirt floors, the way she'd, um, save every vegetable scrap for soup stock—[ashamed] I used to lie about it at culinary school. Said my family was in, er, "agriculture." [sarcastic] Agriculture. Like we were some kind of wine estate owners or something. [laugh] 

But honestly, [slowly] everything on my menu right now? It's basically—I mean, it's her recipes. [warm] The bone broth that food critics are calling "transcendent"? [chuckle] That's literally how Nonna made it because, well, we couldn't afford to waste anything. [trailing off] The fermented vegetables, the nose-to-tail philosophy... 

[very sincerely] Last week this journalist asked about my "innovative preservation techniques" and I just—[gasp softly] I almost cried. Because it's like, these aren't innovations. [emotional] This is survival. This was, uh, this was shame. And now? [pause] Now people pay two hundred dollars to eat the way my family ate because we were poor. [relieved] And the thing is, I'm finally—[smiling speaking] I'm actually proud of it. Those dirt floors, they're... [confidently] they're in every dish I make.
