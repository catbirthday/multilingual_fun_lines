Subject: Your exonerated status inspired you to start a legal aid clinic that just won its first case

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [excited] We won! We actually—God, I can't stop shaking. [laugh] Three years since I walked out of that courthouse, you know, after my exoneration, and I thought I'd never want to see another courtroom again. But today... [warm] today we got Marcus home. Twenty-two years old, same age I was when they locked me up for something I didn't do. [pause] The look on his mom's face when the judge said "case dismissed"—I mean, that's exactly how my mother looked. [emotional] Same tears, same disbelief that the nightmare was actually over. 

[shaky voice] People kept telling me, "just move on, forget it happened," but how could I? Seventeen months I sat in that cell, um, knowing I was innocent. [bitter] The system failed me. [pause] But that's why I started this clinic, right? [confidently] Because I knew there were others—so many others—who needed someone who actually understood. [sigh] Our first case, and we did it. We really did it. [trailing off] I keep thinking about all the letters on my desk, all the people still waiting for help... [very sincerely] This is just the beginning. [emotional] Marcus is free tonight because we didn't give up. [warm] And honestly, that's all I ever wanted—to turn my worst nightmare into someone else's second chance.
