Subject: Finally earning respect as the foe in your professional rivalry, but realizing the competition consumed years of your life

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] You know what the worst part is? She finally said it. After, what—seven years? Eight? She actually said, [mocking] "I respect you. You pushed me to be better." And I just stood there like, um, okay, great. [pause] That's what I wanted, right? I mean, that's literally all I wanted to hear from her. [frustrated] But then I'm driving home and it hits me—God, I spent so much time, you know? Every presentation, every meeting, I was thinking about her. How to beat her. How to, like, prove I was better. [trailing off] And for what...

[regretful] I missed my daughter's recitals because I was working late on proposals to one-up her. Skipped vacations because, well, what if she got ahead while I was gone? [shaky voice] My marriage almost—actually, no, it did fall apart. [sigh] And here's the thing, she probably went home that night and forgot about our whole conversation. Meanwhile I'm sitting here realizing I basically gave her my thirties. [very melancholic] All those years, just... gone. For what? For respect from someone who, honestly, I don't even like that much? [exhausted] God, I'm such an idiot.
