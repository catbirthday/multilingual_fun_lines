I mean, [pause] watching him walk into that press conference, finally getting introduced as head coach... [emotional] God, I actually teared up. This was a guy who, um, everyone said was done after his knee blew out. Thirty-seven years old, three surgeries, and they just wrote him off. But I knew—[passionately] I knew he had so much more to give! \n\nWe must've sent, what, forty applications? [chuckle] Actually, probably more like sixty. Every rejection, he'd just look at me and say \"next one, right?\" [long pause] And then Syracuse called. His dream job. The school where his dad coached in the seventies. I remember, uh, negotiating that deal at three in the morning because [speeding up] we had to get it done before they changed their minds or went with someone younger or—\n\n[clearing throat] Sorry, I just... [warm] That hug he gave me after signing? Twenty-three years of contracts and deals and millions of dollars moved around, but that hug from Marcus, knowing I helped him transition from player to coach, knowing his kids would see him lead a team again... [trailing off] \n\n[extremely happy] That's when you know you've actually made a difference, you know?"
