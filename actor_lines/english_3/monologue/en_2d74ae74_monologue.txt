Subject: Your art dealer instincts discovering a stolen masterpiece and returning it to the rightful family after 50 years

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] The brushstrokes, I mean, they're unmistakable—it's actually, um, it's really a Monet. [very slowly] Not a copy, not a forgery, but the actual "Garden at Giverny" that went missing in '74. [short pause] I keep staring at it and, you know, my hands are literally shaking because—[overwhelmed] this painting has been hanging in that estate sale for three days. Three days! And nobody, er, nobody else recognized it. [laughing] Can you believe that? 

[very quietly] The Rothschild family, they never... [trailing off] I guess they never thought they'd see it again. [excited] But here's the thing, I've got their contact information from, hmm, from that old provenance database, and I'm going to—[hesitantly] well, actually, I already called them. [warm] The granddaughter, she just, [crying while speaking] she started sobbing when I told her. Said her grandmother used to, you know, sit in front of this painting every morning with her coffee. [sniffle]

[passionately] Fifty years! This masterpiece has been, I don't know, floating through black markets, hidden in some—[angry] some thief's private collection, and now... [relieved] now it's finally going home. [very sincerely] That's why I do this job, honestly. Not for the commission, but for moments like, um, like this one.
