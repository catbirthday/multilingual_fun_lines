Subject: Your teenage student just told you they're dropping out because "school is pointless"

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] Pointless? You think—wow. Okay. Um. [pause] I wasn't expecting that today. I mean, I could tell something was off lately, but... dropping out? That's, uh, that's pretty big. [quietly] Really big, actually. [sigh] Look, I get it—I do. Sometimes this whole thing feels like, what's the word... disconnected? From real life? [warm] But here's the thing, and I'm not just saying this as your teacher. When I was your age, God, I thought the exact same thing. [chuckle] Algebra? Shakespeare? I was like, when am I ever going to use this? [hesitantly] And honestly? Some of it, you're right, you probably won't. But it's not really about—hmm, how do I explain this... [speeding up] It's not about the quadratic formula or whatever. It's about learning how to think, how to solve problems, how to stick with something even when it's, uh, even when it sucks. [empathetically] I know it feels pointless right now. I really do. [pause] But dropping out, that's... that's closing doors you don't even know exist yet. [very sincerely] Can we at least talk about what's really going on here? Because I don't think this is just about school being pointless. There's something else, isn't there?
