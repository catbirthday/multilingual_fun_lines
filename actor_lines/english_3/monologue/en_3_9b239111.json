Twenty-three years of studying protocols, memorizing trade routes, shadowing father through those endless council meetings and now... now it's mine. [laugh] The seal, the regency, everything I've—wait. [confused] These treasury reports can't be right. \n\nNo, no no no. This is... ugh, okay, let me look at this again. [anxious] We're running a deficit of, what, seventy thousand gold marks? Monthly? How did nobody—I mean, Father never mentioned that the grain reserves were... \n\n[pause]\n\nEmpty. They're empty. [bitter] Of course they are. And the northern provinces haven't paid taxes in, um... six months? Beautiful. Just beautiful.
