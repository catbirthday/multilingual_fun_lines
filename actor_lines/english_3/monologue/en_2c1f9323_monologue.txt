=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] We won. I mean, we actually—we fucking won. Twenty years of fighting and, um, the legislation finally passed. [pause] Everyone's celebrating, you know? Calling me a hero. [sarcastic] Hero. Right. [long pause] Sarah won't even, like, return my calls anymore. And the kids, they're—[voice breaking] honestly, I don't even know who they are now. [sad] Marcus is seventeen and I missed, what, basically everything? Soccer games, er, school plays, all of it. [frustrated] But the thing is—and I know how this sounds—but those families we saved, [passionately] thousands of them have clean water now because of what we did. [shaky voice] So why do I feel so, I don't know, empty? [regretful] Tom said I chose strangers over my own family. Maybe he's, uh, maybe he's right. [crying while speaking] I keep telling myself it was worth it, you know? That history will—[bitter] History. Fuck history. [very sad] Emma called me by my first name last week. Not Mom. Just... Linda. [whisper] She's only twelve. [long pause] We changed the world, and um, I lost everything that actually mattered. [exhausted] Some victory, huh?
