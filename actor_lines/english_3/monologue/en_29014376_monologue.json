And here I am with, um, seven years of experience, basically every certification you could possibly get, and I've been, you know, practicing play-by-play since I was twelve years old. [furious] Twelve! Recording myself calling games off the TV like some kind of—anyway, it doesn't matter.\n\n[sarcastic] But oh, his dad knows the network president from their country club, so I guess that's what really counts, right? [short pause] All those nights I spent, er, studying game footage, memorizing stats, working local high school games for basically nothing—[trailing off] none of it matters when...\n\n[upset] God, I really thought this was it. Like, the interview went so well, and they actually said—[shaky voice] they said I had the best demo reel they'd seen. [sniffle] The best! But here's the thing, um, Brad's never even called a full season of anything. [angry] Not college, not minor league, nothing!\n\n[very sad] I just—I don't know if I can keep doing this. Maybe, uh, maybe I'm just fooling myself thinking talent and hard work mean something in this industry. [sigh] Twenty years of dreaming about this exact position, and it goes to someone who probably, honestly, sees it as just another job."
