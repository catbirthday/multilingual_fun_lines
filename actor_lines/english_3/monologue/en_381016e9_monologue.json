            "content": "[exhausted] God, I actually did it. Every single case that deserved approval this month—I found a way. Um, thirty-two cases total, and not one denial that shouldn't have been there. [relieved] You know how sometimes you have to dig through like, pages and pages of clinical notes to find that one thing that justifies coverage? [passionate] That's what I've been doing. I mean, Mrs. Rodriguez needed that cardiac rehab, and initially they were gonna deny it because of some technicality, but I went back through her records and found the documentation from 2019 that showed—[warm] honestly, I almost cried when I got that approval letter. \n\n[sighs] These insurance companies, they make it so hard on purpose. But I've learned their game now. Every loophole, every regulation, I know exactly how to frame these cases. [animated] Like today, Mr. Chen's case? They were trying to say his physical therapy wasn't medically necessary, but I cross-referenced the new guidelines with his surgeon's notes and—boom. Approved. \n\n[quietly] I think about these people, you know? They're not just case numbers. [very sincerely] They're somebody's mom, somebody's dad, trying to get better. And I'm the one standing between them and the care they need. [happy] So yeah, this month? Not a single person who needed help got turned away. Not on my watch."
