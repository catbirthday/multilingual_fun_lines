Subject: Your mentee just quit, saying your guidance has been "completely unhelpful and discouraging"

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [upset] Completely unhelpful and discouraging? I mean, that's just—wow. Okay. Um, I really thought I was helping them, you know? Like genuinely believed I was making a difference here. [pause] Maybe I was too harsh? Or, no, I don't think—actually, was I? The thing is, I gave them the same advice that basically helped me when I was starting out, so I figured... [frustrated] God, I don't know anymore. 

They said discouraging. That word keeps, uh, bouncing around in my head. [quietly] Discouraging. Hmm, maybe when I told them their first draft needed work, I should've—but that's honest feedback, right? That's what mentors do. [defensive] I wasn't trying to crush their spirit or whatever, I was just being realistic about the industry. 

[sigh] Except now I'm wondering if, like, all my other mentees felt this way too but just never said anything. Oh God, what if I've been actively making things worse for people this whole time? [shaky voice] That's not—I mean, that was never the intention. I honestly thought tough love was, you know, helpful. My mentor was brutal with me and I turned out... [trailing off] well, I turned out how I turned out. 

[sad] Maybe that's exactly the problem.
