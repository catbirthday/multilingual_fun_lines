Subject: Finally getting justice for something that happened years ago, but feeling empty instead of vindicated

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] They called this morning. Said, um, guilty on all counts. Just like that. After seven years of—I mean, depositions and, you know, lawyers and basically my whole life on hold. [pause] And I just... sat there. [quietly] Holding the phone like, er, waiting to feel something. Anything, really. [bitter] Everyone kept saying, "You'll feel so much better when it's over," and, well, here we are. [sigh] It's over. He's going to prison. [slowly] The thing is, I thought I'd feel—I don't know, victorious? Or like, relieved at least? [frustrated] But it's just... empty. [trailing off] All those nights I couldn't sleep, imagining this moment... [sad] I guess I thought, hmm, getting justice would somehow fix everything he broke. [laugh] God, that sounds so naive now, right? [very quietly] But the damage is still there. The years I lost are still, you know, gone. [hesitantly] And honestly, seeing his name in the news again just... [shaky voice] it brings it all back. [pause] People keep texting congratulations, like I won something. [bitter] Won what, exactly? The right to say I was telling the truth? [sigh] I mean, I always knew that. [very melancholic] Maybe justice isn't actually about feeling better. Maybe it's just, er, making sure it's on record. [long pause] That it happened. That it mattered.
