[pause] So apparently, um, Jake has been—for YEARS—telling them that I've been, like, [angry] stealing money from his wallet? And that I, er, broke his laptop on purpose? [stuttering] I-I-I never even touched his stupid laptop! [frustrated] The thing is, this explains SO much. Like why Dad's been so, you know, [confused] weird with me lately. And honestly, I thought—[very sad] I actually thought we were getting along better. [bitter] God, I'm such an idiot. \n\n[shaky voice] All those times he was being nice to my face, and then, what, just immediately running to them with, I mean, [furious] complete lies? [pause] Eight years. We've been a family for eight years and he's been, um, [quietly] poisoning them against me this whole time. [sarcastic] Oh, and the best part? He told them I was the one spreading rumors about HIM at school. Which is just—[laugh] I can't even. \n\n[exhausted] You know what though? I'm done. [determined] I'm actually done trying to, like, make this work. If he wants to play these games, then fine. [cold] But I'm not gonna sit here and, uh, pretend everything's okay anymore."
