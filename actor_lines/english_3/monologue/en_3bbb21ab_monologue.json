[whispering] Because of my smile? I don't even—like, I literally just smiled at them when they held the door, you know? [emotional] Oh my God, I might actually cry right now. \n\n[shaky voice] This is so... I mean, nobody's ever done anything like that for me. And honestly, I've been having such a rough week—actually, rough month if I'm being real—and this stranger just... [sniffle] They said my smile brightened their day? [laugh quietly] Me? The person who, er, basically dragged themselves out of bed this morning?\n\n[warm] You know what though, this is—wow. Like, the thing is, I almost didn't even come here today. I was just gonna, sort of, stay home and wallow, but... [pause] [happy] And now these ten people behind me are gonna get free coffee too, and they don't even know why yet. [chuckle] They're all gonna be so confused. \n\n[very sincerely] I guess, um, sometimes the smallest things really do matter, huh? Just a smile. [trailing off] Who would've thought..."
