=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] They let Sarah go yesterday. Twenty years with the company, never missed a deadline, and she's— [pause] she's clearing out her desk while I'm sitting pretty because I knew to laugh at Davidson's golf stories. [sigh] I mean, I saw it coming months ago when they started those "restructuring meetings." [quietly] Sarah didn't. She just kept her head down, doing actual work while I was, um, strategically grabbing coffee whenever the VP walked by. [regretful] Marcus got cut too. Best developer we had, but he never went to happy hour, never played the game, you know? [frustrated] It's not fair, it's not— [trailing off] but that's not how it works, is it? [cynical laugh] I started noticing patterns, like, who got invited to those informal "catch-ups" with leadership. [anxiously] Started making sure I was visible on the right projects, not the important ones, the ones that mattered to the people who mattered. [very quietly] God, listening to myself... [sad] Sarah trained me when I first started. She brought me homemade cookies when I was going through my divorce. [pause] And I just watched them escort her out. [defensively] What was I supposed to do, honestly? Fall on my sword? [bitter] They'd just replace us both. [long pause] I survived because I understood the rules nobody actually says out loud. [very melancholic] But I'm not sure what I've actually won.
