Subject: Your couch surfing welcome just got revoked after overhearing your host call you a "professional freeloader"

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] Professional freeloader? I just—I can't believe she actually said that. [pause] Like, um, I heard her through the door talking to her roommate, and she literally used those exact words. [angry] Professional. Freeloader. 

Well, here's the thing—I've been helping out! I mean, I cleaned the bathroom yesterday, I bought groceries twice, I—[frustrated] whatever, you know? It's not like I've just been sitting around doing nothing. [hurt] I thought we were friends, honestly. 

[sarcastic] But apparently I'm just some kind of, what, parasite or something? [long pause] 

Uh, the worst part is, like—I actually told her about my situation. She knows I'm between jobs right now, she knows about the whole eviction thing, and she was all, [mocking] "Oh stay as long as you need!" [bitter] Right. Sure. 

So anyway, I guess I'll just—[trailing off] I don't even know where I'm gonna go tonight. [sad] My cousin's place maybe? Except, er, he's already made it clear I can't stay there again. [sigh] 

[very quietly] God, maybe she's right. I mean, this is the fourth couch I've crashed on this year, so... [pause] No. No, you know what? [angry] I'm not a freeloader, I'm just having a rough time. There's a difference.
