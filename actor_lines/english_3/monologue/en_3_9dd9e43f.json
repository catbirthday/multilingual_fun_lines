[short pause] I'd been volunteering at the community center for, what, maybe three months? And the whole time I'm thinking about my grandmother back home who barely knows how to answer her flip phone. [laugh] One day I just brought her to class with me. [excited] God, watching her face when she finally got FaceTime working— [pause] She hadn't seen her sister in Poland for twelve years. [very slowly] Twelve years. [emotional] And suddenly there's Aunt Maria on the screen, crying, and my grandmother's crying, and I'm, um... I'm trying not to cry because I need to help her hold the tablet steady. [laugh while crying] They talked for three hours that first call. [sniffle] Now she video calls someone every single day—her cousins in Germany, my uncle in Australia. [cheerful] She even figured out how to send voice messages on WhatsApp, which, honestly, I didn't even teach her that. [very sincerely] Sometimes I think about all those years of missed conversations, and it just... [trailing off] But then I see her showing other seniors at church how to video call their grandkids, and I realize, hmm, maybe this is how it was supposed to happen. [smiling speaking] She needed to learn it to teach it, you know?"
