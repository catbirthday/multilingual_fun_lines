[pause] Three years we've been working on this, and when I saw her score come up on that board, I just... [sniffle] God, I'm getting emotional thinking about it again. You know, when she first came to me, her prosthetic arm couldn't even hold the bow steady. The doctors said the nerve damage was too severe. [frustrated] Everyone kept telling her to try a different sport. But she looked at me and said, \"I dream about archery.\" How do you say no to that? [warm] So we started tinkering. Custom grips, counterweights, this whole stabilization system I basically invented from scratch. Some days we'd spend six hours just adjusting the, um... the angle by millimeters. [laugh] She'd get so mad at me—\"It feels fine, stop obsessing!\" But I knew we could make it perfect for her. [very quietly] The thing is, it wasn't really about the equipment. [pause] She had this fire, you know? Every failed shot, every adjustment, she just kept coming back. [very sincerely] And yesterday, watching her hit that final ten... knowing she'd earned her spot... [crying while speaking] I've never been prouder of anything I've built. Or anyone I've worked with."
