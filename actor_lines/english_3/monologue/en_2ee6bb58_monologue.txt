Subject: Your luthier apprentice just completed their first perfect violin under your guidance

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] Look at that. Just... look at that finish. You know, um, when you first walked through my door three years ago, I honestly wasn't sure if—well, I mean, your hands were so shaky, remember? [chuckle] But this violin, it's... [pause] Maria, this is perfect. Actually perfect. The varnish, the way you carved the scroll—it's like, everything I taught you is right here, but there's something else too. [proud] Something that's entirely yours.

I guess, uh, this is how my master felt when I completed my first one. [nostalgic] Twenty-seven years ago, can you believe that? And here's the thing—I was so nervous I almost dropped it when I showed him. [laugh] He just stood there, really quiet, turning it over and over in his hands. Kind of like I'm doing now, hmm? 

[emotional] You're not my apprentice anymore, you know that, right? This violin—it's basically your graduation. Your, er, declaration to the world that you're a true luthier. [pause] God, I'm getting all—[sniffle] Sorry, it's just... you've worked so hard. And honestly, this instrument will sing for generations after we're both gone. [very sincerely] That's what we do, Maria. We make things that outlive us.
