Subject: Discovering your unique problem-solving approach in logistics has saved your company millions in shipping costs

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Wait, hold on—these numbers can't be right. Um, let me just... okay so I'm looking at the quarterly report and it says we saved—[gasp] oh my God, THREE MILLION dollars? From my routing algorithm? That's... I mean, that's not possible, right? 

[slowly] Unless... hmm, actually if you calculate the fuel costs across all our distribution centers, and then factor in the, you know, consolidated shipments I suggested... [excited] Holy shit, it actually makes sense! The thing is, I just thought I was, like, tweaking some minor inefficiencies, but this is—wow. 

[laugh] I literally started this whole thing because I was bored one Friday afternoon! Just, er, playing around with the data, and I noticed these weird patterns that nobody else was—[pause] God, I sound so arrogant. It's not that I'm smarter or anything, I just... I guess I looked at it differently? 

[warm] You know what though, honestly, this feels incredible. Like, really incredible. All those late nights trying to convince management that we needed to, um, completely restructure our zones—[relieved] it was worth it. Every spreadsheet, every presentation where they looked at me like I was insane... 

[very quietly] Three million dollars. [cheerful] We saved three million dollars!
