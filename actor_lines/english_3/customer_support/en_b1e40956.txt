Scenario: school counselor, trying to help a student but also needing to fix her own insurance bill

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I'm—wait, sorry—I need to, uh, fix my insurance bill?

Customer Support: Oh absolutely! Let me just, um, pull up your account here. Can you give me your, uh, your member ID or the account number? Should be something like MEM-followed by some numbers...

Customer: It's, um—hold on—sorry, a student just... MEM-4782-B.

Customer Support: Perfect, okay okay, so I've got your account here, MEM-4782-B, and, hmm, I can see there's a billing issue from last month. Let me just, um, dig into this a bit more and see what's... oh, looks like there was a duplicate charge on October 15th, transaction ID TXN-889204-QV.

Customer: Duplicate? I thought—no wait, that makes... yeah. Can you fix—

Customer Support: Oh definitely, definitely! So, um, what I'm gonna do here is, uh, issue a refund for that duplicate charge, and hmm, it'll show up as credit CRD-2847-PK on your next statement, which should post in about, um, three to five business days...

Customer: Three to five... okay. That's—I mean, that's fine I guess...

Customer Support: I know, I know, waiting is never fun! Um, actually, let me see if I can... hmm, okay so if I submit this as priority request PRQ-5502-TL, we might be able to get it done by tomorrow?

Customer: Really? That would—um, sorry, I know you're trying to help...

Customer Support: No no no, don't apologize! This is, uh, this is literally my job, and honestly? The system should've caught this duplicate charge in the first place. Let me just, um, make sure I've got everything right here—so that's refund for $127.50, reference number REF-9903-XM?

Customer: Um, yes, that's—wait, $127.50? Should be $145...

Customer Support: Oh! Oh oh, let me, uh, let me check that again... pulling up the original charge here and... you're absolutely right, I was looking at the wrong line item. Sorry about that! So it's it's $145.00, and I'm updating the refund request right now, new reference is REF-9904-XN.

Customer: Thanks. I just—there's so much going on today, and I can't...

Customer Support: Totally understand, um, sounds like you've got a lot on your plate. Okay so, uh, everything's submitted now under case number CSE-7701-RD, and you should get an email confirmation in about, hmm, ten minutes or so?

Customer: Email. Right. Um, will it—never mind, I'll just... thanks.

Customer Support: Actually wait, um, before you go—I'm just gonna, uh, add a note here that says to expedite this, and... there! Also, I'm seeing you might qualify for our, um, our educator discount? Says here you work at a school?

Customer: Oh—I'm a counselor, yeah. But I didn't know—

Customer Support: Yeah yeah! So, um, we've got this program, code EDU-DISC-2024, that's like 15% off monthly premiums for school staff? I can just, uh, I can apply that retroactively too if you want, going back three months...

Customer: That's really—I mean, um, yes? Please? Sorry, it's been a day...

Customer Support: No worries at all, seriously! Okay so I've applied the educator discount, confirmation EDD-3398-KT, and, um, with the refund and the retroactive discount, you should actually see about $218.50 coming back total. Is there, uh, is there anything else I can help with today?
