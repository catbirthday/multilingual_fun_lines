Scenario: asking why their service was downgraded without consent

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I just—I just noticed that my, uh, my service got... I think it's been downgraded?

Customer Support: Oh, um, yes, hello! So I'm—I'm really sorry to hear that, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, um, can I get your account number or, er, the phone number associated with the account so I can, you know, take a look at what might have happened there?

Customer: Sure, sure. It's... wait, let me—no, actually it's 555-0147.

Customer Support: Perfect, um, thank you so much, so that's pulling up account AC-7739-NM21 and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that there was a, um, a change made on October 15th and—oh, oh gosh, I'm really sorry about this—it looks like your premium plan was, uh, switched to our basic tier.

Customer: I didn't—I mean, I know this probably isn't your fault but, um, I never asked for that? I just... I don't understand.

Customer Support: No no, you're absolutely right to be confused, and I'm so sorry this happened—looking at the notes here on ticket TKT-49182-B, it seems there was an automatic system adjustment due to a payment processing error last month, but this definitely should have been communicated better to you.

Customer: Payment error? But I—I mean, um, everything's been going through fine, I think? I just... sorry, there's been so much lately and I'm kind of...

Customer Support: Oh gosh, I completely understand, and please don't apologize—let me check the payment history on your account, just one moment... okay so transaction TRX-8847291 from September did initially fail but then it went through successfully two days later, which should have prevented any service changes.

Customer: So it's—it's just another system thing then. I mean, um, I get it, you're probably dealing with this stuff all day and I'm not—I'm not trying to make your job harder, I just...

Customer Support: No no no, please, you're—you're being so understanding and I really, um, I really appreciate that, but this is, uh, this is definitely our mistake and I'm going to, um, let me see what I can do here to fix this immediately, okay? Your confirmation number for this call is CNF-772-894-XK and I'm—I'm putting in a priority request right now.

Customer: That's... okay. Thank you. I just... I can't even...

Customer Support: I know, I know, and um, I'm really, really sorry you're dealing with this—so I've submitted the restoration request RES-66429-QT and, uh, normally this takes 24-48 hours but I'm, um, I'm marking it as urgent because this was completely our error, so you should see your premium features back within, er, probably 2-3 hours maximum.

Customer: Hours? Not... not days? Sorry, I just expected worse.

Customer Support: Oh, um, no, definitely not days! Since this was, uh, our system error and not a, you know, a billing issue or anything, I can—I can fast-track it using override code OVR-5521-K, and actually, um, let me also add a service credit to your account for the inconvenience.

Customer: You really—you don't have to do that. I know you're probably... it's been a long day for you too.

Customer Support: That's, um, that's really kind of you to say but honestly, this is—this is the least I can do, so I'm applying a, uh, a $50 credit under reference CRD-9944-TZ88, and it'll show on your next statement, and um, again, I'm just so sorry about all of this.

Customer: I just... thank you. Really. I'm sorry for being so... scattered. Everything's been...

Customer Support: Please, you have nothing to apologize for—you've been incredibly patient and understanding through this whole mess that we created, and I've documented everything in case notes CN-445821 so if there are any other issues, any representative can see exactly what happened and help immediately.

Customer: Okay. Okay okay. That's... that helps. Thank you for being so... human about this.

Customer Support: Of course, of course, and um, thank you for your patience today—your service should be fully restored shortly and you'll get an email confirmation to the address on file with tracking number TRK-8829-MNQ41, and, uh, please don't hesitate to call back if you need anything else at all, okay?
