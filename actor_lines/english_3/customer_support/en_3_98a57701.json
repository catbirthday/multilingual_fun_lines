I can see the previous representatives' notes indicating document verification issues. Let me review the specific rejection codes to understand exactly what's happening."

This is causing an automatic rejection at step four of the verification process. This definitely needs immediate escalation to our document review team."

Interest will continue to accrue on your unsubsidized portion of $34,670, but not on your subsidized loans totaling $22,150 during this period."
