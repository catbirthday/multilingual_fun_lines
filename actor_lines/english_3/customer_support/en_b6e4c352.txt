Scenario: phlebotomist, anxious about an unexpected charge on her HSA card

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I just, uh, checked my HSA and there's like this charge I don't recognize?

Customer Support: Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's happening, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and... hmm, can you give me your member ID so I can, um, take a look at what's going on?

Customer: Yeah, it's MED-4937-B22.

Customer Support: Okay, um, thank you, so I'm looking at member ID MED-4937-B22 and, uh, I can see... oh, hmm, there's a charge here from, um, let me just... it's showing as transaction TXN-093847-HC for $247.50, is that the one you're, uh, asking about?

Customer: Two forty seven? That's... wait, from where?

Customer Support: So, um, I'm really sorry but it's showing as, uh, "Medical Equipment Supply" and the reference is REF-8829-QM, which is, um, kind of vague, I know, and uh...

Customer: Um, I didn't order any equipment, I mean, I'm a phlebotomist so like, uh, the office handles all that.

Customer Support: Right right, I completely understand, and I can see why that would be concerning, especially since... let me check if there's more detail in claim CLM-77293-XP about what specific items this covered.

Customer: So can you just, um, reverse it or...

Customer Support: Um, well, here's the thing, and I'm, uh, really sorry about how confusing this is, but it looks like... hmm, the charge is from, um, "Precision Medical Supplies" with vendor code VND-3847-PS, does that ring any bells at all?

Customer: Precision? No, that's not—I mean, we use, uh, different suppliers at work.

Customer Support: I understand completely, and this must be really frustrating, so what I can do is initiate a dispute under case number DSP-994637-R and we'll investigate this charge thoroughly.

Customer: How long's that gonna take?

Customer Support: So, um, typically these disputes take, uh, about 5 to 7 business days, but I'm going to, um, mark this as priority under code PRI-8826-A because I can see you're, uh, in the medical field yourself and probably need your HSA funds available.

Customer: That's what the last rep said. Three weeks ago. Different charge.

Customer Support: Oh no, I'm so, so sorry you've been through this before, that's just... um, let me look at your history here and, uh, I can see case DSP-882910-T from last month, is that what you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah. Still waiting on that one actually.

Customer Support: That's completely unacceptable, I'm just... um, I'm really sorry, let me, uh, escalate both of these right now to our resolution team and, um, I'm putting in override code OVR-7749-EM to expedite everything.

Customer: If you can actually fix it, that'd be... I mean, I need my HSA to work.

Customer Support: Absolutely, I completely understand, and I promise I'm going to personally monitor both case DSP-994637-R and your previous case to make sure they're resolved within 48 hours, not weeks.
