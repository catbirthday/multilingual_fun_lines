Scenario: valet attendant, nervous about a damage claim for a scratch that wasn't his fault

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, I just... I think there's been a mistake? With a claim?

Customer Support: Hey there, um, let me just, uh, pull that up for you real quick. Can you give me your, er, claim number or maybe your employee ID?

Customer: It's um... EMP-4421. I'm sort of... really scared right now.

Customer Support: Got it, so that's EMP-4421, and I'm seeing claim CLM-9983-BV here about, um, vehicle damage at the Marriott location? Listen, I actually, uh, used to work valet myself back in college, so I totally get how nerve-wracking these things can be.

Customer: Wait, you did? I mean... I didn't do it. The scratch.

Customer Support: Yeah yeah, um, three years at a hotel downtown actually. So looking at your file here, REF-2287-QM shows the, uh, damage report was filed at 2:47 PM yesterday?

Customer: Um yeah but like, the car already had it. I swear. I just... I can't lose this job.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, here's what we're gonna do. I can see in the system that you've got, uh, no prior incidents under account ACC-4421-VA, which is really good. Did you, um, happen to take any photos before you parked it?

Customer: I... no. They don't. We're supposed to but. Nobody does.

Customer Support: Right right, um, I remember that. Look, between you and me? The fact that your record's clean under EMP-4421 means, uh, a lot here. I'm gonna flag this for manual review.

Customer: Um, but what if they still think... My rent's due. I can't.

Customer Support: No no no, we're not letting that happen. So I'm putting in override code OVR-5501-TK right now, and um, I'm also adding a note that the customer has, uh, a history of pre-existing damage claims—found three others on this vehicle in our database.

Customer: There... there were others? Really? Um, so maybe...?

Customer Support: Yep. VIN ending in 3847 shows, um, two previous scratch claims, codes CLM-7734-RD and CLM-8890-PL, both marked as, uh, pre-existing damage. So this is kind of becoming a pattern with this customer.

Customer: Oh god. Okay. I'm... I think I might actually be okay?

Customer Support: You're gonna be fine. Trust me. Um, I'm escalating this right now to review team two, case number ESC-1122-MN, and they're usually, uh, pretty understanding about these situations.

Customer: Um, how long before I know? I'm just. Sort of freaking out still.

Customer Support: So typically it's, um, 24 to 48 hours, but I'm marking it priority under code PRI-9903-XX because, uh, I can see you need this resolved for payroll. Actually, you know what? I'm gonna give you my direct extension too.

Customer: You'd... you'd really do that? I mean, um, thank you. Really.

Customer Support: Absolutely. Extension 4477. Um, call me tomorrow afternoon and I'll, uh, personally check where we're at with case ESC-1122-MN. We're gonna get this sorted, I promise.
