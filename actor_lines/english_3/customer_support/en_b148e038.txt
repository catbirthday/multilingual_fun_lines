Scenario: optometric technician, detail-oriented about vision insurance claim calculation errors

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So um, I'm calling about... what's the word... discrepancies. Vision claims. They're uh, they're all wrong.

Customer Support: Oh! Hi there! Yes yes. Let me just—actually wait—let me pull up your account. Quick. Need your member ID. Starts with VSN probably?

Customer: VSN-48293. Listen, um, I work in optometry, right? These EOB calculations, they're... they're not adding up.

Customer Support: Got it got it! VSN-48293. Okay so um, I'm seeing here, uh, let me just... hmm... you've got like three recent claims? CLM-7782-VX, CLM-7791-VX, and um, CLM-7804-VX? I think those are—yeah. Which one?

Customer: All three. That's what the last person said they'd fix.

Customer Support: Oh! Oh okay. Right right. So—no wait—let me actually look at the details here because I really want to help you get this sorted!

Customer: Um, look, the copay's wrong, the uh, the allowable amount... what do they call it... reimbursement rate? All off. Way off.

Customer Support: Absolutely! Yes! So um, for CLM-7782-VX I'm seeing, uh, a copay of forty-five dollars? And then. Wait. The allowable is... hmm... three twenty? Does that sort of match what you're seeing?

Customer: Forty-five? No no no. Should be thirty. I've been a customer twelve years.

Customer Support: Right right! Okay so—let me just—I think maybe there's been a coding issue? Like um, procedure code 92015 instead of 92014? That would. Yeah. Change things.

Customer: Um, exactly, yes, that's... that's the problem. Every single claim, wrong codes.

Customer Support: Oh wow wow. Okay so um, I'm really excited because I think I can actually fix this! Let me just, uh, submit a correction batch? Takes about. Hmm. Five minutes?

Customer: That's what they said last week. And the week before.

Customer Support: Oh. Oh no. So you've—I mean—you've called before. About this. Same issue.

Customer: Three times. Um, I document everything, dates, reference numbers, uh... what's it... confirmation codes. Got 'em all.

Customer Support: That's. Wow. I'm so sorry. Really. Let me—no wait—actually I'm going to escalate this? Like right now? To tier two? Reference number ESC-9847-TK22.

Customer: Um, why should I believe this time's different? Seriously. Why?

Customer Support: Because um, I'm giving you my direct extension? It's uh, 4782. And I'm. Look. I'm putting a personal flag. On your account. PFL-3392-XX. I'll check it. Tomorrow. Myself.

Customer: Extension 4782. Fine. But if this isn't fixed...

Customer Support: It will be! I promise! I mean—I think—no actually I know it will because um, I'm literally watching the escalation go through right now and... yeah. Confirmed. You'll get an email. Within the hour.
