Scenario: complaining that the mobile app keeps crashing

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, so basically the app just... it crashes. Like, constantly. I can't even—

Customer Support: Got it. Okay. Let me see here... um, so you're having crashes with the mobile app. Which version? Check under settings—should show, uh, something like APP-4.2.1 or similar.

Customer: Hmm, let me... okay so it says, um, 3.8.2?

Customer Support: Oh! Oh oh oh. I see what happened. That's... that's ancient. Like, um, really old. Version 3.8.2 had, uh, massive stability issues. Let me check your account ID real quick—what's your email?

Customer: Wait, really? That's it? Just old?

Customer Support: Yep. Pulling up your account now... okay so, hmm, account ACT-77492-BK shows you've been stuck on 3.8.2 since, uh, wow, six months ago. Auto-update must've failed somehow.

Customer: So basically I've been, um, fighting this thing for nothing?

Customer Support: Pretty much! Here's what we'll do. Delete it. Fresh install. I'm pushing, um, a priority update flag to your account right now—code UPD-9982-QX. Should force latest version.

Customer: Um, okay so like, delete now? While we're talking?

Customer Support: Yeah yeah. Do it. I'll wait. Once you reinstall, um, there's gonna be a prompt for verification code. Ready? It's VER-445821. That'll sync everything back up instantly.

Customer: Wait this is, uh, actually happening? Like right now?

Customer Support: Right now! I love these. Easy fix. Big impact. So, um, while you're downloading—your transaction history under TXN-8847729-A through TXN-8847745-C? All preserved. Nothing lost.

Customer: Okay it's, um, it's installing... hmm... done! Code?

Customer Support: VER-445821. Enter that. Should see, uh, a green checkmark, then your home screen. Everything exactly where you left it. Except, you know. Working.

Customer: Oh my god. It's... wait, it's so fast now!

Customer Support: Version 4.3.7! Night and day. That old version was, um, basically held together with digital duct tape. Your device ID DEV-337294-M is showing all green on my end now.

Customer: I can't believe I just, like, suffered for months?

Customer Support: Happens constantly. People think it's them. It's not. Oh! Quick thing—I'm adding, um, note NFT-7739 to your account. Any issues next 30 days? Priority support. Skip the queue.

Customer: Wait really? That's, um, that's amazing. Thank you!

Customer Support: My pleasure! Seriously. These calls? Where I actually solve it? Best part of my day. Your confirmation number is CNF-994472-RT for this fix. Anything else breaks—don't wait six months!
