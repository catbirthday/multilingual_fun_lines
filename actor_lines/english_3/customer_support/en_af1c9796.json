These notices are, er, written by lawyers and they're not exactly, hmm, user-friendly? But basically with your claim ID, CLM-88291-MK, you just enter that on the website, answer a few questions about, uh, whether you were affected, and then choose if you want a check or a credit."

And just so you know, the average payout for this one is, er, between seventy-five and a hundred-fifty dollars, depending on... hmm, how long you were a customer and, uh, what information was involved. Is there anything else about the settlement I can help clarify?"
