Scenario: warehouse worker, tired and wanting a straight answer about a 401k withdrawal

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look I just—I just need to know, um, can I get my 401k money? Like, uh, how fast? This month?

Customer Support: Okay okay so, um, let me just—I'm pulling up your account here and, uh, I need to make sure I'm getting you the right—the right information because, um, 401k withdrawals have, like, specific rules and I want to—let me see here... your account number is ACC-48291-BK7 right?

Customer: Yeah yeah that's—wait, is there a penalty? Nobody's nobody's giving me straight answers.

Customer Support: Right right so, um, there's—okay so basically there's a few things happening here and I want to make sure you understand all the—um, let me break this down properly because, uh, I see you have about $12,847 in your account under plan ID PLN-7764-QR and, um, if you withdraw before age 59½ there's gonna be—

Customer: Just—can I get it. Or not. That's that's all I'm asking.

Customer Support: Yes! Yes you can—you can absolutely, um, access it but, uh, let me just—I need to tell you about the penalties so you're not surprised later because, um, I want to protect you from any shock when you see the final amount.

Customer: So basically what, like, um, they take half? Is that—I mean, uh, how bad is it?

Customer Support: No no no, um, not half, so it's—let me calculate this exact—exactly for you here... okay so with your balance of $12,847 under transaction code TXN-9982741-M, you're looking at, um, a 10% early withdrawal penalty plus, uh, regular income tax withholding which is usually—usually around 20% federal so—

Customer: Thirty percent gone. Great. So so basically I get, what, nine thousand?

Customer Support: Um, actually let me—let me run the exact calculation here because, uh, I want to give you the precise—hmm, okay so after the penalty and withholding on withdrawal request WDR-5541-TK9, you'd receive approximately, um, $8,993 but wait—wait actually there might be state tax too depending on—

Customer: I'm sorry I'm just—I'm really tired. Double shift. Can't can't think straight.

Customer Support: Oh no no, um, don't apologize, I totally—I totally understand and, uh, let me make this super simple for you, okay? So basically, um, if you need the money, we can process withdrawal form FRM-1122-WD9 and have funds in your account within, uh, 7-10 business days.

Customer: Wait wait, um, there's no way to get it faster? Like, uh, emergency or or something?

Customer Support: Actually actually, um, yes! So there's—let me check your eligibility for hardship withdrawal under code HWD-3387-X because, uh, that might actually help you avoid some of the—hmm, what's your situation if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: It's it's rent. Behind three months. Eviction notice, so... yeah.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, that definitely—that definitely qualifies as hardship and, uh, I'm gonna set you up with the expedited process right now using reference REF-6672-EVT and basically, um, we can get this moving faster, like 3-5 days instead and I'm also—let me see what else I can do here to help protect your—

Customer: Three days? Um, that's—okay okay, that works. I think. Maybe.

Customer Support: Right right and, um, I'm also gonna—gonna note in your file under case number CSE-10094-RP that this is urgent housing-related so, uh, if anyone questions it or tries to slow it down, we have documentation and, um, I'll personally monitor this to make sure it goes through smooth—smoothly.

Customer: I just—sorry for being short. Been been a long week, you know?

Customer Support: No no no, um, please don't worry about it at all, I completely—completely get it and, uh, listen I'm gonna give you my direct extension EXT-4429 and reference number REF-88512-HW so if you need anything or, um, if there's any delay just call me directly and I'll—I'll push it through myself, okay? We're gonna get you through this.
