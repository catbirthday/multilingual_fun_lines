Scenario: asking for a detailed account history going back several months

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi—I need to—wait, sorry. Need my account history. Several months back.

Customer Support: Oh! Okay okay so um, I can definitely help you with that, let me just—sorry, I need to pull up your account first, can I get your account number? It should be like ACC-something with numbers?

Customer: It's, uh—let me find—ACC-4429-BK.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect, so ACC-4429-BK, I've got you here and—oh. Um. So I'm seeing that our standard history only goes back—wait no, sorry, I mean the online portal only shows thirty days but I can definitely get you more, how far back did you need?

Customer: Six months? I know it's—sorry, prob'ly a pain for you.

Customer Support: No no no, it's totally fine, really! So um, here's the thing though—and I'm really sorry about this—but anything past ninety days requires a special request through our archives department with form FRM-2847-A and it usually takes three to five business days to process?

Customer: Three to—wait. Um. That's—I actually need this today.

Customer Support: Right right, I know, I'm so sorry, I really wish I could just—let me check something else. Your account type is showing as standard tier STD-001 which means—oh wait, actually no, sorry, I was looking at the wrong screen.

Customer: So can you—is there a way to just—get it faster?

Customer Support: Um, so like, here's what I can do right now, I can get you the last ninety days immediately through our quick export system QEX-7739, and then for the older stuff I could try to expedite the archive request but honestly? Even expedited is still like forty-eight hours minimum.

Customer: Uh, that's—I mean, I guess. Yeah. Do both.

Customer Support: Absolutely, yes, so I'm starting with the ninety-day export now, reference number REF-558291-QE, and you should get that in your email within five minutes, is the address on file still active?

Customer: Um, yeah—wait, which—which one do you have?

Customer Support: Showing j.martinez at, um—oh gosh, sorry, I shouldn't say the full thing out loud—starts with J-M-A-R and ends with gmail?

Customer: That's—no, actually. Use the—um—the outlook one.

Customer Support: Got it got it, updating to the outlook address now and—okay so that's processing under transaction TXN-994587234, and then for the archive request I just need to ask you like three quick security questions if that's okay?

Customer: Sure. I just—this is for taxes and I'm already late.

Customer Support: Oh no, yeah taxes are the worst, I'm so so sorry you're dealing with this! Um, okay so first question, can you verify the last four digits of the payment method on file?

Customer: It's, uh—8827. Or wait—no that's—8872. Sorry.

Customer Support: Perfect, 8872, and I've got the archive request submitted under case number CSE-774429-ARC, and like I said, forty-eight hours for expedited, but um, honestly sometimes it comes through faster, especially for tax stuff, so maybe check tomorrow afternoon just in case?
