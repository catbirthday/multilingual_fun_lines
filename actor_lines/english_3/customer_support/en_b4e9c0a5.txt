=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, yeah, so I'm calling about these, uh, bogus charges on my—wait, do you know who I am?

Customer Support: Let me just—okay, um, pulling up your account here. What's the, uh, the name on the account?

Customer: Jackson Landscaping. We do the, um, the municipal contracts downtown.

Customer Support: Got it, got it. So I've got account BUS-4429-JL here, and um, let me just, uh, check the rental history—what equipment are we talking about specifically?

Customer: The, uh, the aerator. I returned it on the—no wait, actually—it was the 15th.

Customer Support: Okay okay. So I'm seeing, um, rental ID RNT-88264-A for a core aerator, and it shows, uh, picked up October 15th, returned October 22nd, so that's the full week charge of—

Customer: No no no, that's—I mean, um, I brought it back the same day!

Customer Support: Right right. Let me just—hmm, actually I'm seeing a, uh, what's the word... a notation here. Says "customer declined receipt at return." Did you maybe—

Customer: Um, well, I was in a rush and, uh... but your guy said it was fine...

Customer Support: Sure, sure. So without that return receipt RCP-15102, the system just, um, it keeps charging until we do the physical inventory check, which was October 22nd.

Customer: This is, um, this is ridiculous. I need to speak to—do you even know how much business we...

Customer Support: Look, I totally—let me just—I can actually override this. Been here long enough. Adjusting to one-day rental, credit memo CRD-9847-X processing now.

Customer: Oh. Um, really? Just like that?

Customer Support: Yep. Shows, uh, $340 credit back to your account. Should hit in, um, 2-3 business days, reference number REF-2024-10-8892.

Customer: I'm sorry, I'm just—uh, it's been a really long week and...

Customer Support: No no, totally get it. Equipment costs are, um, they're brutal right now. Just, uh, next time grab that receipt, saves us both the headache.

Customer: Yeah, I—um, I should've just... anyway, thanks for fixing it.

Customer Support: All good. Oh and, uh, looks like you've got reservation RES-90125-B for the overseed tomorrow—still need that?

Customer: Um, oh right, yeah, definitely. That's still... yeah.

Customer Support: Perfect. Got you confirmed. Anything else I can, uh, help you with today?
