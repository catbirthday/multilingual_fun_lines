Character 1: So, um, I've been analyzing our, [very slowly], inventory metrics and basically, you know, we're turning stock way too slowly.

Character 2: Oh no, how bad are we talking? I noticed the warehouse looked pretty packed last week, but I didn't realize it was becoming an actual problem.

Character 1: We're at 4.2 turns per year.

Character 2: Wait, only four times? That's rough, especially if we're trying to free up cash flow - what's causing the bottleneck, do you think?

Character 1: Er, poor forecasting mostly, I mean, we're ordering based on gut feel instead of, sort of, actual demand patterns.

Character 2: That explains why we have like three months of those blue widgets sitting around! Have you calculated how much working capital we're tying up unnecessarily?

Character 1: Well, about $180,000 that could, honestly, be used elsewhere, like, for marketing or equipment upgrades.

Character 2: Uh, that's actually insane when you think about it - the thing is, we're basically using our warehouse as the world's most expensive storage unit.

Character 1: Hmm, the worst part is, I guess, [very melancholic] some of this inventory is becoming obsolete anyway, which means write-offs.

Character 2: How much are we [whispering] looking at writing off? Because if it's significant, we need to tell the boss before quarter-end hits.

Character 1: So, probably uhh, fifteen to twenty thousand, kind of depends on what we can salvage.

Character 2: Ouch. Have you thought about implementing just-in-time ordering or maybe negotiating better payment terms with suppliers to help with the cash crunch?

Character 1: I've modeled both scenarios in Excel.

Character 2: Of course you have! What's the projected improvement if we switch systems? And please tell me it's dramatic enough to justify the hassle.

Character 1: We could hit eight turns annually with proper implementation.

Character 2: Double our current rate? That's [yawn] amazing actually - sorry, been up since four studying for my supply chain certification exam.

Character 1: Err, the ROI is [smiling speaking] compelling, right so, payback period is under six months, it's just that, convincing management might be tricky.

Character 2: Ah, they really hate change, but here's the thing, we can't keep bleeding cash like this - maybe start with a pilot program?

Character 1: Smart. Test it with our top ten SKUs first.

Character 2: Umm, I can help build the presentation if you want, okay so, we make it super visual and pretty much impossible to say no to.
