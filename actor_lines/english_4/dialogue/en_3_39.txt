Character 1: So, um, I just got accepted into, you know, this electrician apprenticeship program that, basically, starts next month.

Character 2: Wait, that's incredible! Which union are you going through, and how competitive was the application process? I've heard some of those programs have like hundreds of applicants.

Character 1: It's, well, through IBEW Local 3, and honestly, the test was brutal - like, algebra and reading comprehension, er, plus this crazy spatial reasoning section.

Character 2: Did they tell you what the pay progression looks like? And are you going to be doing commercial or residential work primarily? I'm fascinated by how these programs structure everything.

Character 1: Starting at twenty-two an hour, then it goes up every six months.

Character 2: Twenty-two to start? That's, hmm, [jealous] already more than I make with my degree, and you know, you're learning an actual trade that can't be outsourced.

Character 1: Plus full benefits and a pension after I journey out.

Character 2: How long until you're a full journeyman? And do you get to pick your job sites, or does the union just assign you wherever they need bodies?

Character 1: Five years total, actually, with like, 8,000 hours of on-the-job training, and uh, about 900 hours of, sort of, classroom instruction.

Character 2: That's so structured compared to college! Are you nervous about the physical demands, or is that something you're actually looking forward to after desk work?

Character 1: The physical part doesn't bother me at all.

Character 2: I've been thinking about, err, [cough] switching careers myself - do they take people with zero construction experience, or well, would I need to prep somehow first?

Character 1: Actually, they prefer blank slates because, [confidently] you know, they can train you their way without, basically, having to undo bad habits from other jobs.

Character 2: That's really encouraging! What about, hmm, the culture though - is it still pretty male-dominated, or actually, are things changing with more women and diverse applicants getting in?

Character 1: It's changing fast - my orientation class was, [cough] I mean, about thirty percent women and, uhh, really diverse overall actually.

Character 2: Oh that's [cheerful] so much better than I expected! Do you know if they have programs for other trades too, like plumbing or HVAC, through the same system?

Character 1: Yeah, each trade has its own union and [whispering] apprenticeship program with different requirements.

Character 2: Have you already gotten your tools and gear sorted out? I imagine there's a whole list of stuff you need before day one hits.

Character 1: The union actually, um, provides the first set of basic tools, but like, I'll need to buy, well, better ones as I go along basically.

Character 2: This is making me seriously reconsider my whole career path - would you mind if I picked your brain more about the application process over coffee sometime this week?
