=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [groan] Another anonymous tip about suspicious activity in the park?

Character 2: Well, uh, yeah actually. Look, I know I've been calling a lot lately but this time I saw something really concerning near the playground area, like, genuinely worrying stuff happening after dark.

Character 1: You never leave your name when you call.

Character 2: [gasp softly] Oh that's... I mean, I always give a name. I use, um, different ones sometimes but there's always a name attached to the report, right?

Character 1: You just used three different names this week.

Character 2: Okay so, mmm, here's the thing - I have my reasons for being careful about identity stuff. Let's just say certain people would be, uh, really interested in knowing where I am and what I'm doing these days.

Character 1: [flirtatious] Mystery person with a secret past. How intriguing.

Character 2: Hah, it's not as exciting as it sounds, honestly. More like, you know, boring legal stuff and some family drama that got way out of hand, but I'd rather not get into all the messy details.

Character 1: What should I call you then?

Character 2: Oof. Right now? I guess... Sam works fine. Generic enough that it doesn't really matter if it's real or not, and easy for both of us to remember when we're talking.

Character 1: [high-pitched] Sam? That's what you're going with?

Character 2: Yeah okay, I know it's kind of basic but that's sort of the point, isn't it? Blend in, don't stand out, keep things simple and, um, uncomplicated while I figure out my next move.

Character 1: Are you in witness protection or something?

Character 2: Not exactly, no. It's more like, err, voluntary relocation? Self-imposed exile? Jeez, those both sound way too dramatic for what's essentially just avoiding some really awkward confrontations with people I used to know.

Character 1: You realize this makes you sound incredibly suspicious, right?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, I mean, I hear myself talking and I'm like, wow this person sounds guilty of something. But honestly it's just, you know, complicated personal stuff that spiraled into needing some distance and anonymity for a while.

Character 1: And you're calling in tips about the park because...?

Character 2: Because I actually do see concerning things? Like, being paranoid about my own situation doesn't mean I'm making stuff up. That van's been there three nights running and, uh, the driver never gets out.

Character 1: Fine. Tell me about this van.

Character 2: Dark blue, maybe black in this light, no plates visible from where I'm standing. The thing is though, I recognize it from, well, let's just say from before I became "Sam" and started making anonymous calls to you.
