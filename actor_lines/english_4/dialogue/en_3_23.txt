Character 1: Hi there, um, you must be the new systems analyst, basically starting today?

Character 2: That's me, yeah! I'm Alex, just moved here from Portland last week and still finding my way around both the city and this massive office complex.

Character 1: Welcome to the team. I'm Jordan, senior project lead.

Character 2: Oh great, well, I was hoping to meet you actually, you know, since HR mentioned we'd be working pretty closely on the infrastructure migration project. I've been reading through the documentation all morning, trying to get up to speed on your current architecture.

Character 1: The d-d-documentation is, uh, [stuttering] probably outdated, I mean, by about six months.

Character 2: That's actually what I was [bitter] afraid of, sort of. The version control timestamps looked ancient, and half the diagrams reference systems that don't even appear in your current network topology.

Character 1: So we've been, kind of, updating as we go recently.

Character 2: No worries, hmm, I've worked in environments like that before, anyway. Once at my last job, we discovered our entire disaster recovery plan referenced servers that had been decommissioned two years earlier— talk about a fun surprise during an audit.

Character 1: Er, that sounds honestly like a nightmare scenario.

Character 2: It was like complete chaos for about, I guess, [laugh loudly] three weeks while we scrambled to document everything from scratch. But hey, at least it taught me to always verify documentation against actual running systems, never just trust what's written down.

Character 1: Uhh, smart approach, the thing is, we've had similar experiences here.

Character 2: I can imagine, ah, most places [shy] struggle with keeping documentation current, really. Would it help if I started mapping out what's actually running while I learn the systems, maybe create some updated diagrams as I go?

Character 1: That would be, okay so, incredibly helpful, it's just that we haven't had time.

Character 2: Totally understand, mm, here's the thing though— I actually enjoy that kind of detective work. Finding discrepancies between what's documented and what's real, tracing network paths, identifying mystery servers that nobody remembers installing but somehow became mission-critical.

Character 1: Mystery servers, err, we probably have about a dozen of those.

Character 2: Classic, huh, every company has them, essentially. At my previous job we found one that had been running untouched for eight years, hosting a critical database everyone thought was somewhere else entirely.

Character 1: Umm, that's both impressive and, right so, terrifying.

Character 2: Right? The best part was it was named "TEST-SERVER-DELETE-ME" but had become production somehow.

Character 1: Oh we have several with, anyway, names exactly like that running production workloads.

Character 2: Well, sounds like I'm [enunciating every word] going to feel right at home here, basically. Should we grab coffee and you can give me the real story about what I'm walking into, beyond what HR's official onboarding materials suggest?
