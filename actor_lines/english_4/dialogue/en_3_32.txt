=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Um, wait, did we already, you know, cut the cake? I mean, I can't remember if we, er, did that part yet.

Character 2: We haven't cut the cake yet, though I suppose it doesn't really matter since half the people have already left and the rest seem ready to follow them out the door.

Character 1: Oh! The speeches! Did I give my speech?

Character 2: You gave your speech twenty minutes ago, right after dropping your notes and before you forgot your cousin's name - it's all documented in the schedule that nobody's following anyway.

Character 1: I should, uh, probably [yawn] find my notes again, you know, just in case I need to, well, say something else later.

Character 2: Your notes are crumpled in the punch bowl where you left them, though I doubt anyone will ask for an encore performance given how the first one went.

Character 1: The decorations look amazing! When did we put those up?

Character 2: This morning at 6 AM, as planned, though three of the balloons have already popped and the banner's starting to sag on the left side, which seems fitting somehow.

Character 1: Should we do the group photo now? Or did we do that?

Character 2: We attempted it twice, but, hmm, people keep [laugh] wandering off, so, you know, we only have partial groups - honestly, it's like herding cats in a thunderstorm.

Character 1: I forgot to thank the DJ! Is he still here?

Character 2: The DJ left an hour ago, which is, um, actually [curious] concerning since, well, the music is still playing somehow - I guess he just left his laptop running on shuffle.

Character 1: What about the gift table? Did someone move it?

Character 2: Right.

Character 1: So, wait, the gifts are, uh, still there? I mean, I should probably, you know, check on them or something.

Character 2: They're exactly where they've been all day, though, er, I noticed someone's toddler was, basically, unwrapping them earlier - honestly, at this point it hardly matters since this whole event is slowly unraveling anyway.

Character 1: Actually, I think I, um, left something important in the, well, kitchen? Or maybe it was, you know, the coat room?

Character 2: Whatever you left is probably [shaky voice] gone by now, just like the extra champagne and half the centerpieces - people have been helping themselves to everything that isn't nailed down.

Character 1: Oh! The thing is, we should, hmm, do the toast soon, right? I mean, before everyone, uh, leaves completely.

Character 2: Most people are already gone or heading to their cars, but sure, we can toast to the empty chairs and wilting flowers - it seems appropriately symbolic for how everything eventually falls apart.
