Character 1: So, um, I heard you're researching, like, how music affects brain chemistry, you know, specifically during trauma processing?

Character 2: Oh yes, I've been studying how certain frequencies can [crying while speaking] permanently alter neural pathways, especially when subjects are in vulnerable emotional states. It's fascinating how the right combination of tones can essentially reprogram someone's fear responses.

Character 1: That sounds intense. Are we talking about therapeutic applications here?

Character 2: Therapeutic is, well, such a limiting word, [enunciating every word] don't you think, I mean? My research explores how musical stimuli can fundamentally restructure personality matrices, basically beyond what traditional therapy ever imagined possible, you know.

Character 1: Wait, uh, restructure personality? That's, actually, that sounds kind of dangerous, er, doesn't it?

Character 2: Dangerous? Oh please, everything worthwhile involves [mocking] some risk, doesn't it? I've discovered that specific harmonic progressions can trigger dissociative states so profound that subjects literally forget who they were before the experience.

Character 1: Forget who they— okay so, are you, like, saying you can erase people's identities, basically?

Character 2: Not erase, transform. Think of it as liberation from the prison of their constructed self. My test subjects report experiencing pure consciousness, untethered from their previous traumas, relationships, even their names become meaningless.

Character 1: Your test subjects? Um, this is, I guess, actually happening? Like, you're really doing this to people?

Character 2: Twenty-three volunteers so far, all willing participants who understood the risks. Well, understood as much as anyone can understand transformation until they experience it firsthand.

Character 1: [very quickly] How is this even legal I mean there must be ethical review boards or something?

Character 2: Ethics committees are surprisingly [laugh] flexible when you frame research correctly. Besides, my subjects sign extensive waivers, and technically they're participating in "experimental sound therapy for treatment-resistant depression"— which isn't entirely inaccurate.

Character 1: This is, hmm, completely insane, anyway. You're basically, er, performing mind control experiments, right so?

Character 2: Mind control suggests coercion, but my subjects [very meekly] beg to continue the sessions. Once someone experiences ego dissolution through precisely calibrated binaural beats, they crave that freedom from selfhood like nothing else.

Character 1: Freedom from selfhood? That's not freedom, that's obliteration.

Character 2: Spoken like someone trapped in their own consciousness. You know, I could demonstrate with just a simple five-minute audio sample, completely harmless at low exposure, just enough to show you what lies beyond your mental boundaries.

Character 1: Absolutely not. I think I should leave.

Character 2: Oh come on, where's your scientific [laugh histerically] curiosity? You came here asking about my research, and now when offered a firsthand glimpse into the most revolutionary psychological breakthrough of our time, you want to run away?

Character 1: Revolutionary breakthrough? This is, [belly laugh] honestly, you know, the most terrifying thing, uhh, I've ever heard someone describe as science!

Character 2: Terrifying, yes, well, that's what they said about, actually, every paradigm shift in human understanding, isn't it? But don't worry, I mean, I've already recorded our entire conversation, and your voice patterns suggest you'd be, um, an excellent candidate for phase two trials.
