=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [happy] So you're the new neighbor who just moved in upstairs?

Character 2: [mumbling] Yeah, that's... that would be me, I suppose. Still getting used to the whole building actually, the layout's kind of confusing with all those half-floors and the way the numbers skip around.

Character 1: [cough] I heard a lot of hammering last night around eleven.

Character 2: Right, sorry about that. Got a bit carried away with the whole picture-hanging situation and didn't realize how late it had gotten until my phone started buzzing with the noise complaint app notification.

Character 1: There's a noise complaint app?

Character 2: The building manager mentioned something about it when I signed the lease. Apparently it's this whole system where people can anonymously report issues, though I'm not entirely sure how anonymous it really is when we all know each other's apartment numbers.

Character 1: I didn't report you.

Character 2: [clearing throat] No, I didn't mean to suggest— I wasn't implying you did anything. Just making conversation about the weird digital infrastructure of modern apartment living, you know how it is.

Character 1: Are you always this nervous?

Character 2: Not nervous exactly, more like... aware of how first impressions tend to stick. Once you're the loud neighbor, you're always the loud neighbor, even if you were just trying to make your place feel like home.

Character 1: Fair enough. I'm Jamie, by the way.

Character 2: Alex. Nice to officially meet you instead of just being ceiling footsteps and floor creaks to each other. This building's got surprisingly thin barriers between lives, doesn't it?

Character 1: You could say that. I can hear your coffee grinder every morning.

Character 2: [apologetic] Oh god, is it that loud? I've been doing this whole fresh beans routine thinking I was being sophisticated, but maybe instant coffee's the more neighborly choice after all.

Character 1: No, it's actually kind of nice. Like a reliable alarm clock.

Character 2: [chuckle] That's one way to frame it, I guess. Better than being known for midnight hammering or whatever other disruptive habits I might accidentally develop while settling in.

Character 1: [laugh loudly] You should hear the couple in 4B during their yoga sessions.

Character 2: Yoga's supposed to be quiet though, isn't it? Unless they're doing some kind of extreme version I haven't heard about, which honestly wouldn't surprise me in this neighborhood.

Character 1: [gasp softly] Wait, you don't know about their "yoga"?

Character 2: Starting to think maybe I don't want to know, based on your reaction. Some mysteries about our neighbors are probably better left unsolved, especially when we all share ventilation systems.
