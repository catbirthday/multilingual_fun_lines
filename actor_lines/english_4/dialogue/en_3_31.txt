Character 1: Hi, I just got the closing disclosure. Everything looks good on my end.

Character 2: Oh wonderful! I'm so glad, um, you've had a chance to review it, and you know, everything appears to be in order. We're really moving along smoothly, and I'm here to make sure this entire process feels comfortable for you.

Character 1: Thanks. So, uh, what are the, I mean, next steps from here?

Character 2: Perfect question! Tomorrow we'll do the final walkthrough at 10 AM to ensure the property is in the agreed-upon condition, then Friday at 2 PM is your closing appointment at the title company.

Character 1: I'm a bit [upset] worried about the walkthrough. What if something's wrong?

Character 2: Oh, I completely [laugh hard] understand that concern - everyone feels that way! But in my experience, walkthroughs almost always go smoothly, and if we do find anything, we have options to address it before closing.

Character 1: That's reassuring. Um, should I bring, well, anything specific to the, you know, walkthrough?

Character 2: Actually, just bring yourself and, er, maybe a phone to [happy] take photos if you'd like! The thing is, we're just verifying everything matches your expectations, and honestly, it's usually a really exciting moment when reality hits.

Character 1: Good to know. And for the actual closing?

Character 2: For closing, you'll need your driver's license, the certified check for closing costs which we discussed is $8,432.50, and any questions you might have - though we'll review everything thoroughly together.

Character 1: I've already arranged the certified check with my bank.

Character 2: That's fantastic - you're so, hmm, well-prepared! I mean, having that ready early really, basically, takes pressure off the final day. You're doing everything perfectly, and I'm genuinely impressed with how organized you've been.

Character 1: Will you be at the closing with me?

Character 2: Absolutely, I'll be right there, you know, beside you the entire time, and like, if any questions come up, we'll, err, address them together. You're never alone in this process - that's my promise to every client.

Character 1: That means a lot. How long does closing usually take?

Character 2: Typically about an hour to ninety minutes, and we go through each document at your pace - there's absolutely no rush, and I encourage you to ask about anything that needs clarification.

Character 1: You've been [friendly] so helpful throughout this, um, whole process, really.

Character 2: Oh my goodness, that's so, well, kind of you to say! Honestly, helping people like you, I guess, navigate this journey successfully is why I love what I do - your comfort and confidence mean everything to me.

Character 1: I actually feel pretty calm about Friday now.

Character 2: That makes me so, so happy to hear! You know, your calm approach has, actually, made this process smoother for everyone, and, uh, I just know Friday is going to be a wonderful celebration of your new home.
