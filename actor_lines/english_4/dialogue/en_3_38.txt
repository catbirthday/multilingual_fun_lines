Character 1: So, um, did you manage to find, you know, a menorah that wasn't kind of sold out everywhere?

Character 2: Well, I ended up ordering one from West Elm online, basically, their brass one with the modern design, but err, shipping took forever since everyone's buying them right now.

Character 1: Oh wow, so, are you still doing that, I mean, big party you were planning, actually, for the eighth night?

Character 2: Honestly, yes! I've got latkes from Goldbelly coming in frozen, uhh, those fancy ones from Russ & Daughters, and I sort of splurged on some artisanal sufganiyot from this Brooklyn bakery.

Character 1: Did you really [laugh hysterically] order frozen latkes instead of making them from scratch like bubbe would?

Character 2: Look, hmm, between work and everything else, the thing is, I'd rather spend time with family than, like, standing over hot oil for three hours straight.

Character 1: Mom's going to be [bitter] so disappointed when she finds out you're outsourcing tradition.

Character 2: She'll get over it when she tastes them - plus I got her favorite chocolate coins from Vosges, the ones with sea salt and exotic spices she loves.

Character 1: Uh, speaking of gifts, anyway, [sneeze] did you remember to, I guess, get something for all eight nights?

Character 2: Actually, [sad] I'm struggling with that because, you know, I wanted to support small businesses but umm, everything from Etsy and Uncommon Goods is backordered until January.

Character 1: Wait, er, you're telling me you didn't plan ahead, really, even though Hanukkah is, okay so, the same time every year?

Character 2: Basically, I had everything in my cart from The Grommet, ah, these beautiful handmade dreidels and mezuzah cases, but just procrastinated on actually checking out.

Character 1: That's [sniffle] exactly what happened to me with the kids' presents.

Character 2: Have you tried Maisonette for the kids? They have this whole Hanukkah collection with educational toys and books that actually ship same-day in some cities.

Character 1: I, sort of, forgot they existed, well, but honestly, aren't they super expensive?

Character 2: They're definitely pricey, but their curation is incredible - plus they have this partnership with PJ Library for Jewish children's books that are actually engaging.

Character 1: Do you think, like, the kids even care where their presents, um, come from anyway?

Character 2: Probably not, but I care about supporting brands that actually understand our traditions instead of just slapping blue and white on generic holiday stuff.

Character 1: Fair point - remember last year's "Hanukkah bush" fiasco at Target?

Character 2: Oh god yes, that was so cringeworthy, but [very quietly] at least Crate & Barrel and CB2 have gotten better at offering authentic Judaica alongside their regular holiday collections.
