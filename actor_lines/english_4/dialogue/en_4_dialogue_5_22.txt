=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're the new Scrum Master? How's the team taking to agile?

Character 2: [slowly] Well, um, it's been interesting. We started with such high hopes, you know? Daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives—the whole nine yards. But honestly, I'm starting to see some cracks in the foundation already.

Character 1: What kind of cracks?

Character 2: Oh god, where do I even start? The product owner keeps changing priorities mid-sprint, which, I mean, defeats the entire purpose. And the developers are treating story points like, uh, some kind of mystical currency that nobody really understands.

Character 1: But agile is supposed to embrace change, right?

Character 2: Sure, embrace change, not embrace chaos. There's a difference between being flexible and just, mmm, throwing everything out the window every three days. Yesterday they wanted to pivot the entire product direction. Again. For the fourth time this month.

Character 1: [groan] Not another pivot. Are the retrospectives helping at all?

Character 2: The retrospectives have basically become complaint sessions where nothing actually changes. We identify the same problems every sprint—lack of clear requirements, too many meetings, technical debt piling up—but then we just, uh, keep doing the same things anyway.

Character 1: Maybe you need better buy-in from management?

Character 2: Management thinks agile means we can deliver twice as fast with half the resources. They heard "iterative" and somehow interpreted it as "instantaneous." It's like they only read the first paragraph of the Agile Manifesto and called it a day.

Character 1: [hesitantly] Have you tried explaining the actual methodology to them?

Character 2: Oh, I've tried. Believe me. But they just nod and smile and then ask why we can't just "be more agile" about the deadlines. Like, that's not what agile means! It's becoming this meaningless buzzword that justifies any terrible decision.

Character 1: What about the development team? They must see the benefits?

Character 2: [joking] Benefits? Yeah, they love having seventeen meetings a week to discuss why they don't have time to code. Sprint planning takes four hours, daily standups somehow stretch to forty-five minutes, and don't even get me started on the, er, "grooming sessions."

Character 1: [frustrated] This sounds like you're doing waterfall with extra steps.

Character 2: That's exactly what it is! We've got all the ceremonies and rituals but none of the actual agile mindset. It's like, mmm, cargo cult agile—we're going through the motions hoping something magical will happen, but we're just exhausting everyone.

Character 1: [long pause] So what are you going to do about it?

Character 2: Honestly? I'm about ready to just give up. Three months of trying to implement this properly and we're worse off than when we started. The team morale is in the toilet, productivity is down, and everyone blames agile instead of our terrible implementation.

Character 1: [furious] You can't just give up! That's exactly what reinforces the anti-agile narrative!

Character 2: [sneeze] Sorry, allergic to false hope apparently. Look, maybe agile works somewhere, but here? We're just, uh, rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic while calling it a sprint. I'm updating my resume tonight.
