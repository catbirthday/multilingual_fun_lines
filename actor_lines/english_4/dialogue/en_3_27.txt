Character 1: I noticed you've been [flirtatious] working late again. Third night this week.

Character 2: Yeah, well, I'm trying to finish this grant proposal, you know, but honestly, my mind keeps wandering to, uh, other things whenever you walk by my office.

Character 1: That's, um, I mean [stuttering] I wasn't trying to, er, distract you or anything.

Character 2: No no, it's not, like, a bad distraction - actually, having you around makes these late nights, hmm, bearable, and I guess I've been hoping you'd stop by to chat.

Character 1: I just thought, well, you might [very meekly] want some coffee, so, or maybe, um, some company.

Character 2: Coffee would be, ah, perfect! You know, I was just [animated] thinking how this place feels, basically, less lonely when you're here, and honestly, your timing is always somehow exactly when I need a break.

Character 1: Sometimes I wonder if we're [slurring] both just, you know, avoiding going home to, err, empty apartments, I mean.

Character 2: God, that's, umm, exactly it - here's the thing, at least here we have each other's company, even if we're just, sort of, working in parallel most of the time.

Character 1: It's comfortable, I guess, this, um, routine we've developed, you know, without really, like, planning it.

Character 2: Right? We've somehow created this, well, unspoken agreement where we just, basically, exist in the same space, and it's actually become the best part of my day.

Character 1: Mine too, if I'm being honest.

Character 2: Listen, I've been, err, meaning to ask - would you maybe want to, [whispering] you know, grab actual dinner sometime instead of just, um, vending machine snacks at midnight?

Character 1: That would be [yawn] nice. A real meal sounds good.

Character 2: Perfect! There's this place downtown that stays open late, serves incredible Thai food, and the atmosphere is really cozy - we could go tomorrow if you're free?

Character 1: Tomorrow works, uh, assuming we don't, like, end up here until, well, midnight again somehow.

Character 2: Ha, yeah, so, let's make it a firm plan - 7 PM, and actually, we'll both leave on time for once, I mean, no excuses allowed.

Character 1: Okay, that's, hmm, reasonable, though I should probably, you know, finish this report first.

Character 2: See, this is, basically, exactly our problem - we're both terrible at, er, leaving work at work, but honestly, maybe that's why we understand each other.

Character 1: I suppose we do [confidently] understand each other pretty well by now.

Character 2: We really do, and I think, um, that's [very sincerely] what makes this, whatever this is between us, feel so, well, naturally right somehow.
