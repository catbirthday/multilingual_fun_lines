=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're the one everyone says is impossible to work with. Interesting.

Character 2: Woof, that's quite an introduction. I mean, I wouldn't say impossible, maybe just, uh, selective about who I trust. Most people don't bother to look past the surface anyway, you know?

Character 1: Maybe because you give them nothing to work with?

Character 2: [very sincerely] That's not entirely fair, though I suppose I can see why it might seem that way. I've just learned that being too open too quickly tends to backfire, especially in, well, professional settings where everyone's got their own agenda.

Character 1: Professional settings? This is a coffee shop.

Character 2: Right, yeah okay, but I'm talking about in general. Like, you meet someone new and suddenly they want your whole life story, your opinions on everything, and, erm, it's exhausting honestly.

Character 1: [mocking] Oh no, human connection. How terrible for you.

Character 2: Alright so, that's exactly the kind of response that makes me shut down. You don't know anything about me but you're already, mmm, making these sweeping judgments based on what, exactly?

Character 1: The fact that you've been sitting alone for an hour pretending to read the same page?

Character 2: [over confidently] Ha! Actually, I'm a speed reader, so I've been through this book three times already. It's just that fascinating that I keep going back to certain passages, if you must know.

Character 1: [friendly] Sure you have. What's it about then?

Character 2: [whispering] It's about quantum mechanics and consciousness, which sounds pretentious, I know. But there's this whole section on, uhh, observer effect that genuinely makes you question reality itself.

Character 1: You're deflecting. We were talking about why you're so closed off.

Character 2: Was I though? Man, you're really determined to psychoanalyze a complete stranger. Look, maybe I'm closed off because people like you come in hot with accusations instead of, I don't know, normal conversation?

Character 1: Normal is boring. I prefer getting to the interesting stuff immediately.

Character 2: [speeding up] Well okay, interesting stuff, here we go then—I haven't slept properly in three weeks, I'm avoiding my ex who works across the street, and yeah, I've been coming here every day because it's literally the only place I feel somewhat normal anymore.

Character 1: [excited] Now we're talking! See how much better honesty feels?

Character 2: [excited] Honestly? It feels terrifying but also kind of liberating, like jumping off a cliff but realizing halfway down that, erhm, maybe you actually do have wings or something equally ridiculous.

Character 1: Want to grab dinner and tell me about this ex?

Character 2: That's... wow, um, quite the escalation from harassment to dinner invitation. But yeah, alright, apparently I'm making terrible decisions today anyway, so why not add one more to the list?
