Character 1: So you're telling me that [cry] vocal coaches actually make people meow like cats for warm-ups?

Character 2: Well, um, it sounds ridiculous but, you know, those exercises actually help with breath control and, basically, loosening up the vocal cords before serious training begins.

Character 1: Wait wait, so, are you saying, like, professional singers are just, err, secretly cat people?

Character 2: Not exactly - I mean, the meowing is just one technique, and honestly, we also do sirens, lip trills, and, uhh, tongue twisters that would make your head spin.

Character 1: Do they, um, also make you [child-like] talk like babies, you know, to find your, actually, "natural voice"?

Character 2: Oh god, well, there's this [shy] thing called, er, "vocal regression" where, basically, we explore different registers, but it's, you know, more scientific than just baby talk!

Character 1: I bet, hmm, you secretly love the, like, meowing part though, anyway, don't you?

Character 2: Look, between you and me, the meowing is actually pretty liberating once you get over the initial embarrassment of sounding like a deranged house pet.

Character 1: Have you, uh, ever accidentally meowed in, sort of, public after too much practice?

Character 2: Okay so, there was this one time at Starbucks where I, umm, ordered my latte and, basically, a little trill slipped out at the end.

Character 1: Please tell me someone recorded that magnificent moment.

Character 2: Thank god no - but, honestly, the barista looked at me like I'd, err, lost my mind and asked if I, you know, needed medical attention.

Character 1: What other embarrassing exercises do they torture you with?

Character 2: Oh there's the "motorboat" where you blow raspberries for minutes on end, plus this thing called "the siren" where you slide from your lowest to highest note like an ambulance.

Character 1: I'm just, like, [belly laugh] imagining a room full of adults, actually, making these sounds, you know, completely seriously!

Character 2: The [sniffle] worst part is when newcomers walk in during warm-ups and see twenty adults buzzing their lips and mooing in unison - their faces are absolutely priceless.

Character 1: Do you, umm, ever question your, basically, life choices during these moments?

Character 2: Every single session! But then I hit a [loudly] perfect high C after all that ridiculous preparation and suddenly the cat noises seem worth it.

Character 1: So, uh, if I wanted to, [monotone] like, improve my speaking voice, honestly, would I have to meow too?

Character 2: Actually, for speaking you'd, well, probably just do humming and, I guess, resonance exercises, but hey, the meowing is, you know, always there if you want the full experience!
