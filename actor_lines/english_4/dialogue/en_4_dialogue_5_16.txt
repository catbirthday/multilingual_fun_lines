=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Wait, you're not Rachel from accounting.

Character 2: [confidently] No, definitely not Rachel. I'm Marcus, and I'm guessing you're not the team I signed up with either. Looks like we both got stood up by our groups, which means we're stuck together in what appears to be a Victorian murder mystery room.

Character 1: Great. I've never done one of these before.

Character 2: Perfect timing to learn then. See that blood splatter on the wall? It's pointing toward the bookshelf, which means there's probably a hidden lever or false book. Standard escape room logic—everything bleeds clues in these places.

Character 1: Should we introduce ourselves properly first? I'm Sarah.

Character 2: Sarah, nice to meet you under deeply weird circumstances. We've got fifty-eight minutes to solve a murder or we lose, and honestly, my competitive streak won't let that happen. You good with puzzles, riddles, that sort of thing?

Character 1: I do crosswords sometimes.

Character 2: That's actually perfect. These rooms love wordplay and letter patterns. Check that desk drawer while I examine this suspiciously prominent portrait of what I'm assuming is our victim. Lord Blackwood, according to the briefing we ignored.

Character 1: There's a diary here but half the pages are ripped out.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] Oh god, this portrait's eyes just moved when I touched the frame and now I'm having flashbacks to every horror movie I've ever seen. Why did I suggest we split up? This was such a terrible idea.

Character 1: Are you seriously crying right now?

Character 2: [very sincerely] Look, I talk a big game but animatronic portraits cross a very specific line for me. My sister traumatized me with a haunted house when I was eight and apparently I never recovered. Can we please work side by side from now on?

Character 1: The diary mentions a chandelier at midnight.

Character 2: Midnight, of course! Look at that grandfather clock—it's stuck at 11:47. We need to move the hands to midnight, which will probably trigger something with the actual chandelier above us. Classic environmental storytelling.

Character 1: How do you know all this?

Character 2: I've done about forty of these rooms across three cities. Started as a weird first date idea two years ago, turned into a full-blown obsession. My apartment basically looks like an escape room now, which really confuses delivery people.

Character 1: Found a key inside the clock.

Character 2: Brilliant! That's got to open the cabinet with all those suspicious chemistry bottles. We're actually making good time here—most first-timers spend twenty minutes just reading every single piece of paper they find.

Character 1: Is that supposed to be a compliment?

Character 2: Absolutely it is. You've got natural instincts for this, Sarah. Most people overthink everything, but you're just following the breadcrumbs exactly how the designers intended. We might actually beat this thing.
