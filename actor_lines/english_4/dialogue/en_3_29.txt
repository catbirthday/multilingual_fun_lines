Character 1: So, um, you're saying the belay technique is, like, similar to how crops, well, actually grow?

Character 2: Not quite the belay itself, but the systematic approach we use in climbing parallels agricultural phenology - both require understanding sequential stages and environmental triggers for optimal outcomes.

Character 1: Wait, phenology? That's not a climbing term I've heard before.

Character 2: Right, it's the study of cyclic biological events - think of it [laugh] like how we assess rock conditions
