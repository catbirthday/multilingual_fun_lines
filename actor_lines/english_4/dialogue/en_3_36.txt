Character 1: So, um, when you think back, you know, to those early days, which, er, numbers stand out most clearly?

Character 2: Well, honestly, it's 47 - that's how many, um, days I went without electricity that first winter, counting each one like, you know, marking territory I'd survived.

Character 1: That must have felt endless in the moment.

Character 2: It stretched like taffy, each day pulling longer than the last, but now those 47 days feel compressed into this dense little nugget of resilience I carry everywhere.

Character 1: Were there other numbers that became anchors?

Character 2: Oh absolutely - like, 3 was huge, actually, because that's how many, err, meals I could squeeze from one, basically, chicken when things got really tight.

Character 1: The precision of survival, hmm, becomes [cry] its own, you know, kind of poetry, I guess.

Character 2: Exactly - you start seeing life in these mathematical terms, like 14 steps to the water pump, 6 matches left in the box, 2 blankets between 4 people.

Character 1: Did, uh, counting become, sort of, a coping mechanism or more like, anyway, a way to maintain control?

Character 2: Both really - so, counting was my, umm, meditation and my anchor, right so, giving structure to chaos when everything else felt, you know, completely unmoored.

Character 1: I imagine, well, certain numbers, er, still trigger memories even now, honestly.

Character 2: Oh they do - like, I can't see 23 without, uhh, remembering that's how old I was, basically, when everything fell apart, or hear 89 without thinking, you know, about my neighbor's apartment number where I'd go for help.

Character 1: The way you [cough] describe it makes each number feel sacred somehow.

Character 2: They became my rosary beads in a way - each one holding a specific prayer or promise, a moment I survived that proved I could survive the next one too.

Character 1: Do you, actually, ever find yourself still, um, counting things unconsciously, like, out of old habit?

Character 2: All the time - I count [very sad] stairs, heartbeats, seconds between thunderclaps, it's this quiet arithmetic that keeps me grounded, reminding me I made it through when the counting really mattered.

Character 1: The way, err, you've transformed that, basically, trauma into something, hmm, almost beautiful is remarkable.

Character 2: Well, you have to, uhh, find beauty [sneeze] somewhere or the weight of it all, you know, becomes unbearable - so, those numbers became my art, actually, my proof of persistence.

Character 1: What number, um, means the most to you now, like, looking back at, well, everything?

Character 2: It's 1,825 - so, that's how many days it took, honestly, to feel human again, and I, er, cherish every single one because, you know, each was a choice to keep going.
