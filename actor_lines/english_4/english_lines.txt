Customer: Um, hi, so like, I just wanted to... hmm, let me see here... I wanted to say thanks for, uh, being patient with me?
1. Oh! Um, of course, of course—I mean, there's no—wait, sorry, let me just—so basically you don't need to thank me at all, uh, I'm here to help however you need, and um, I've got your account pulled up here with number ACC-7739-BK22.
Customer: That's... that's really kind. I have, um... calls are hard for me.
2. I totally—I mean, uh, I completely understand, and um, so basically we can take this at whatever pace works for you, like, there's no rush at all here, and uh, I can see your recent order OPR-4492-XM is, um—sorry, let me just—it's all set up fine.
Customer: Okay so that means... wait, um, did it ship already? Because like, I couldn't tell from the email.
3. Right right, so—oh wait, actually—um, let me check the tracking for you, uh, TRK-889043-PPL shows it's, um, it left the warehouse yesterday—no sorry, that's—I mean today, this morning.
Customer: Oh good. Um, I know this isn't your fault but like, the website is so... I just can't...
4. No no, I—um, I'm really sorry about that, like, our site can be—it's not—I mean, uh, it definitely needs work, and um, I'll make sure to note that in your account that, uh, phone support is preferred, reference note NTE-3847-Q.
Customer: That's so, um... you don't have to do that. I mean, uh, I'm sorry for being difficult.
5. Oh no no no! You're not—I mean, um, you're absolutely not being difficult at all, like, this is—uh, everyone has different needs and that's, um, that's totally fine, really.
Customer: Hmm, what if... um, is there a way to just, like, skip the automated menu next time?
6. Yes! So—wait, um, actually yes, uh, I can set up a direct line code for you, it's—let me just—okay so it's DLC-7739-VIP, and um, basically when you call, just press star and then, uh, enter that code and it'll—sorry, it'll bypass everything.
Customer: That's... I'm getting overwhelmed, um, in a good way. Like, nobody ever... I just...
7. It's okay, it's—um, I mean, uh, it's really going to be okay, like, we want calls to be, uh, easier for you, and um, there's also—oh wait, should I—there's a text support option with code TXT-9982-SM if that's ever, um, if that helps sometimes.
Customer: So basically what happened is like... I've been dreading calling anywhere, and um, you're being so...
8. I'm just—um, I'm really glad I could help, and uh, honestly like, you were so polite about everything, and—wait, sorry, I mean—is there anything else with your order or, uh, anything else I can set up?
Customer: Let me see here... um, actually, hmm, the delivery instructions? Can you, uh, add something?
9. Absolutely, yes—so um, let me just—I'm in your delivery preferences now, uh, under profile PRF-7739-BK22-DLVR, and um, what would you like me to—sorry, what should I add?
Customer: Just, um, "please knock softly" because like, loud sounds are... anyway, so that would help.
10. Got it, got—I mean, um, that's added now, uh, "please knock softly" is saved to all your deliveries, and um, I've also put a permanent note, PRM-NOTE-44573, that, uh, all your future reps will see about, um, taking extra time if you need it, so like, nobody will rush you.
Customer: Um, I need to cancel my order. It's, uh, probably still processing but I need it gone.
11. Okay okay. So, um, let me just, hmm, pull up your account here and—oh wait, I'm seeing, uh, order number ORD-7462-BX9 that went through about, er, two hours ago? And it's already—hmm, let me check—yeah it's in fulfillment.
Customer: Wait, what? I've been a customer for six years.
12. Right right, I see that! You've been with us since, um, 2018 actually, and I really want to, uh, protect your experience here because you're clearly, er, one of our valued—let me see what I can do in the system, okay so, hmm, it's showing status code FUL-8829 which means...
Customer: That's what—no wait, I just, um, I placed it two hours ago, how's it already—
13. So here's what I'm gonna do for you. Um, I'm going to, uh, make sure that even though it's technically in processing with, er, tracking ID TRK-9983-ML2, I'm gonna flag this right now and, hmm, put a rush on the cancellation request because I don't want you stuck with something you don't need.
Customer: Um, I think, er, that's what the last person said. Last time.
14. Oh no no no, um, I'm actually—wait, let me just—I'm putting in override code OVR-4421 right now as we speak, and, uh, this isn't just a request, I'm actually, er, escalating directly to fulfillment center FC-North-7 to physically stop the package.
Customer: I don't—probably won't work. Nothing ever does.
15. Absolutely.
Customer: Um, so like, how long? Because I kind of need to know, uh, today.
16. Hmm, okay so normally—er, sorry, I mean typically it's 24 hours but, um, because I'm using the priority flag PSF-1122, you should get confirmation within, uh, let me calculate—two to three hours max, and I'm gonna personally monitor this under case number CSE-8837-ZQ9.
Customer: Two to three—that's, um, I mean, er, I guess that's something.
17. And, um, here's what else I'm doing—I'm adding, uh, a note to your account profile ACP-7763 that says, er, any future cancellations get, hmm, expedited handling, so you never have to, um, deal with this kind of delay again, because honestly you shouldn't have to.
Customer: Sort of, uh, hard to believe after all this.
18. No I totally get that, and, um, I'm really sorry you've had, er, bad experiences before, but I'm literally—hmm, wait, let me just—yeah, I'm sending you confirmation email right now to, uh, the address on file with reference number REF-5592-KLM so you have proof of everything we discussed.
Customer: Um, maybe, I think—wait, actually will the refund be, uh, automatic?
19. Oh! Yes, um, so once the cancellation processes through system code SYS-3847, the refund, er, automatically initiates within—it's on the—sorry, within 3-5 business days to your original payment method ending in, hmm, let me see, 4782.
Customer: Fine. I've been loyal for, um, for years, this shouldn't be so hard.
20. You're absolutely right, and, um, I'm actually making sure—er, wait, I'm documenting this whole thing under complaint ID CMP-9984-TW3 so that, uh, our team reviews why this happened because, hmm, six-year customers like you deserve so much better than this hassle, and I'm, er, really sorry we let you down today.
Customer: Um, hi, so I'm probably, uh, calling too early here but... hmm, let me see... I ordered a, um, refrigeration unit?
21. Oh hi there! No no, you're—actually wait—you're not too early at all. Let me just—um, let me pull up your account here. Can you give me your order number or, uh, maybe the email you used?
Customer: Oh god, I'm so stupid, um... let me find that... hmm, okay so...
22. Hey, it's totally fine, really. Take your time. While you're looking—I mean—most folks don't even know they should, um, register for warranty beforehand, so you're actually ahead of the game here.
Customer: Found it! Ummm, order... wait, is this right? Um, THX-4429-BK?
23. Perfect! So that's—hmm—okay I see it here, THX-4429-BK, that's the, uh, commercial freezer unit, right? The CompactChill 3000? And it looks like—wait let me just—yeah, scheduled for delivery tomorrow morning.
Customer: Yeah, um, so here's the thing... hmm, what if something's wrong with it when it arrives?
24. Oh, you don't—I mean—you don't need to worry about that at all. So the warranty code, um, WRN-88256-QJ, that's already active from purchase date. But let me just—actually—are you concerned about something specific?
Customer: I just, um... okay so... I run a small fish market and, uh, if this thing breaks...
25. Ohhh, I get it. Yeah, fish market—that's—wow, refrigeration's critical for you. Um, so here's what we can do—I'm gonna flag your account with priority status code PRI-7734-X right now.
Customer: Um, wait, you can do that? I mean, I'm probably worrying over nothing here...
26. No no no, you're being smart. Really. So with that priority code, if—and I mean if—anything goes wrong, we get a tech out same day. Not next day. Same day. That's, um, that's gonna be linked to your warranty WRN-88256-QJ.
Customer: Oh wow, that's... hmm, let me think... um, what if it's like, damaged during delivery?
27. So that's—okay that's actually—let me check something. Hmm. Yeah, so delivery damage is covered under transit protection code TPC-9901-M, which is, um, already on your order. The driver'll do an inspection with you before they leave.
Customer: I'm sorry, I'm being, uh, such a pain about this... it's just, um, my dad started this shop and...
28. Oh hey, no—you're not—this is important! Family business, that's—wow. Um, you know what? Let me also add our extended care package ECP-2245-RT, no charge. That covers, uh, power surge damage, which—for commercial freezers—that's huge.
Customer: Really? Um, that's so... hmm, okay so that means if we lose power and it surges back...?
29. Exactly! You got it. So between your warranty WRN-88256-QJ, the priority code, and now the surge protection—you're basically—I mean—you're covered for everything. Even, um, even compressor issues for five years.
Customer: Um, thank you so much, I just... hmm... I've been losing sleep over this, you know?
30. That's—I mean—running a fish market? That's tough. But listen, you've got my direct extension now, it's showing in your account notes as EXT-4556. Any concerns tomorrow during delivery, you just—you call me directly, okay? We'll get you sorted. Promise.
Customer: Oh wonderful, um, another mystery charge on my... what do you call it... the cable thing.
31. Good afternoon! So, um, I can definitely help you figure out what's going on with your bill there. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can you give me the account number? Should be like, ACC-something at the top of your statement.
Customer: It's, uh... let me find my glasses first... ACC-4429-BK.
32. Perfect, okay so I'm seeing ACC-4429-BK here, and hmm, that's interesting actually. So it looks like—wait, let me just—okay so there was a change on October 15th. Your bill went from ninety-two fifty to one thirty-two fifty, is that what you're seeing?
Customer: Forty dollars for what, exactly? Did I accidentally order... I don't know... premium air?
33. So, um, actually that's—hmm, okay this is weird. So I'm seeing here that, uh, someone added what we call our "Sports Plus Entertainment Package" with code PKG-8827-SE, and um, that's definitely where your forty dollar increase is coming from.
Customer: Sports? Um, I watch... what's it called... the cooking channel and... that's about it...
34. Yeah no, that definitely doesn't sound right then. Let me dig a little deeper here—so the modification was processed through our automated phone system at 2:47 AM on October 15th, transaction ID TXN-445982-PM. That's... that's really odd timing.
Customer: Two in the morning? I mean, uh, I'm usually having my, um, third bathroom trip by then, not... not ordering sports packages...
35. Right, exactly, that's—okay so let me think through this. Sometimes these automated systems can, um, well they can be a bit touchy. Did you maybe, uh, did anyone else in your household maybe try to call in recently? Or, hmm, did you get any calls from us around that time?
Customer: Wait, um, is this gonna keep happening? Because I can't, uh... my pension doesn't exactly... you know...
36. No no no, so, um, we're definitely going to fix this, don't worry. So I'm actually—let me just—I'm removing that package right now, reference number RMV-7745-QX, and, uh, I'm also seeing if I can backdate this to give you a full credit.
Customer: But how did it even... I mean, I don't understand how these things just...
37. So here's what I think might've happened—and this is, um, actually more common than you'd think—sometimes if you're navigating the phone menu and, uh, maybe you press a button accidentally or the system misinterprets something, it can trigger these, like, automatic package additions.
Customer: Oh God, what if, um, what if there's other stuff I don't, uh... I can't keep track of all these...
38. Hey, so, um, actually let me do something here. I'm gonna, uh, run a full audit on your account going back six months, audit code AUD-9982-ML. Just to make sure there's nothing else weird hiding in there, you know?
Customer: That's... I suppose that's... thank you, I just...
39. Okay so—good news—I don't see any other unexpected changes. Just that one October 15th addition. And, um, I've got that forty dollar credit approved, confirmation CRD-3365-PP, so it'll show up on your next bill.
Customer: Um, so next month it'll be... back to normal? The ninety-two fifty?
40. Exactly, yes. So, um, next month you'll actually see fifty-two fifty because of the credit, and then after that, back to your regular ninety-two fifty. I've also, uh, put a note here with flag FLG-7729-NT to block any automatic additions without verbal confirmation. So this definitely won't happen again.
Customer: Good afternoon. I need to discuss a... what's the word... a chargeback. Filed against me.
41. Alright so—let me just—I can definitely help you with that today, um, could I get your merchant account number to pull up the details?
Customer: MER-7294. Private chef services.
42. Perfect, um, so I'm seeing account MER-7294-PC here and, uh, there's a dispute filed yesterday for, hmm, let me see... transaction TXN-829461-QV for three thousand eight hundred dollars, is that the one we're looking at?
Customer: So basically, um, this client—she ate the entire dinner. Five courses. Then files this.
43. I understand—no wait, let me—okay so I can see here that the dispute reason code is RRC-03, which is, um, "services not as described" and unfortunately that's one where we need documentation from your side.
Customer: How do I know you're not just... protecting them? The wealthy ones?
44. So, um, I get why you'd think that but, uh, actually the process is pretty standard regardless of the amount, and, hmm, what I can do is walk you through exactly what evidence packet EPK-7294-01 needs to include.
Customer: Evidence. For food. That's been eaten.
45. Right so—actually let me—the thing is, um, for catering disputes we typically need, uh, signed contracts, photos if you have them, and any communication with the client, reference number DOC-SET-94A covers all that.
Customer: Um, so like, I have texts where she's, uh, praising everything. During the dinner.
46. That's perfect actually, those text messages can be uploaded to case file CSE-829461-A, and, um, if she's specifically mentioning satisfaction with the service, that's really strong evidence.
Customer: She said "divine." Her word. Divine.
47. Excellent, so—wait actually—make sure when you submit those through portal link PTL-7294.disputes.com, um, you include timestamps and, uh, the full conversation thread, not just selected messages.
Customer: So basically what you're, um, telling me is... I have to prove I cooked food. That she ate.
48. I know it's—look, I've seen these before and, um, with proper documentation, especially those texts, dispute reversal rate is about, uh, seventy-eight percent in code RRV-78-FOOD cases like yours.
Customer: Seventy-eight. So one in four, I just... lose. Despite doing everything right.
49. Unfortunately that's—I mean—the bank makes final call on case ARB-829461, but, um, what I can do is flag this for expedited review, should have an initial response within, uh, three business days instead of the usual seven.
Customer: Um, how do I know that's actually, like, expedited? Or just... what you tell everyone?
50. So your expedite code is EXP-7294-11A and, um, you'll get an automated email from notify@disputes-MER.com confirming that status, uh, usually within the next hour, and that's system-generated, not something I control.
Customer: Um, please. I need help. Flight's tomorrow morning and my, uh, my passport renewal still says processing and I just...
51. Oh geez, so, um, passport renewals, yeah those are—like, honestly our system for tracking those is, uh, basically terrible, I'm so sorry. Let me, um, pull up your application, what's your confirmation number?
Customer: PSP-4429-QN. Can't leave without it. Kids are packed. Everything's...
52. Okay so PSP-4429-QN, umm, alright so basically what I'm seeing here is, uh, it actually cleared yesterday but—and this is so typical—nobody, like, updated the website tracking.
Customer: Wait. It cleared? You have it?
53. So yeah, um, it's showing completed as of, uh, 4:47 PM yesterday, tracking number TRK-88290-LP, but like, our notification system has been, um, totally broken all week so you wouldn't have known.
Customer: I've been calling. Three days. Nobody could tell me anything...
54. I know, it's, um, it's honestly ridiculous how bad our phone system is, like, half the reps can't even access the, uh, the expedited passport database, reference code REF-55812-XP, which is probably why nobody could help you.
Customer: Um, so where, uh, where is it? Can I get it today? I'm literally, um, begging here.
55. Right right, so, um, good news is it's at our, uh, distribution center, facility code FAC-2201-B, and, like, technically I'm not supposed to say this but, um, you can absolutely pick it up today before 6 PM.
Customer: Do you know who I've been dealing with? Regional manager. Thompson. Three days of this...
56. So, um, here's what we're gonna do, okay? I'm putting in a, uh, priority pickup order, confirmation PUP-90134-RT, and, um, basically when you get there just, like, mention my operator ID, that's OPR-7765.
Customer: What if they say no? What if it's not...
57. Yeah so, um, they won't say no because I'm, uh, basically putting a manager override in the system right now, code MGR-4451-VS, and, like, between you and me? This happens, um, all the time with vacation travel.
Customer: Um, you're saving my life. I mean, uh, literally saving...
58. No no, I totally get it, like, I had the same thing happen with my, um, my daughter's passport last year, so, uh, now let me just make sure you have everything you need, okay?
Customer: I'll be there. Hour. Do I need the confirmation...
59. So bring your ID and, um, this pickup code I'm giving you, it's, uh, PUP-90134-RT, and also, like, just to be safe, your original application number PSP-4429-QN, and, um, ask for the expedited desk.
Customer: Expedited desk. Got it. If this doesn't work I'm calling Thompson directly...
60. It'll work, I promise, so I'm, um, also sending you an email right now with, uh, everything documented, case number CSE-111290-DP, and, like, my direct extension 4486 just in case, but, um, you should be totally fine.
Customer: Um so basically I'm I'm calling bout—bout my venue deposit? Like, um, I had to cancel and uh they said—they said you'd help?
61. Oh absolutely, I can definitely help you with that venue deposit refund, let me just pull up your account here... so I'll need your booking reference number or the venue name and date if you have those handy?
Customer: Yeah yeah it's um, er, Pine Creek? Oct'ber twelfth? I'm—I'm so grateful you're helping, like seriously.
62. Pine Creek, October twelfth, perfect... okay so I'm seeing your booking here, reference VEN-2024-9847-PC, and I can see the cancellation was processed three days ago, which is good news because that's within their refund window, and I'm going to make sure we get this sorted out properly for you today.
Customer: Um wait so like—so does that mean, uh, I'll get it all back? Cause um it's it's like three grand?
63. So, um, looking at the details here in your file VEN-2024-9847-PC, uh, the standard refund should be... hmm, let me just double-check their policy... okay so Pine Creek typically refunds eighty percent within their fourteen-day window, which means, um, you should be getting back about twenty-four hundred dollars.
Customer: Wait wait wait only—only eighty? But I'm I'm like their top photographer, shot there twelve times!
64. Oh, you've worked with them twelve times? That's actually... hmm, that's interesting, let me look into this a bit more because venues sometimes have different policies for their preferred vendors... pulling up your history now under account PHO-8829-VIP.
Customer: Um exactly, like, uh, do they know who—er, sorry, I mean, um, thank you so much for checking that.
65. So, um, this is really good news actually—I can see here, uh, that you're listed as a platinum vendor in their system under code PLAT-PHOTO-2024, and, um, according to their vendor agreement, platinum photographers get full refunds on cancellations, so I'm going to make sure we update this to the full three thousand.
Customer: Oh my god really? Um that's—that's amazing, like seriously you're you're saving me here!
66. Of course! So what I'm doing now is, um, submitting an amended refund request with your platinum status code PLAT-PHOTO-2024 attached, and, uh, I'm also going to add a priority flag to make sure this gets processed within twenty-four to forty-eight hours instead of the usual five to seven business days...
Customer: Um wait so so like, er, when exactly? Cause I need—I need to pay my assistant and um...
67. Right, totally understand you need this quickly for payroll... so with the priority processing I just added to case number REF-10847-RUSH, you should see the full three thousand dollars hit your account by end of business Thursday at the latest, but honestly it could be as early as tomorrow afternoon.
Customer: Um you know what? If—if it's not there by Thurs I'll just, er, I know the venue owner personally so...
68. Mm-hmm, I hear you.
Customer: But but like um seriously though, uh, you've been—you've been so helpful? More than—than anyone else I've called?
69. Aww, well I'm just really glad I could help get this sorted properly for you, and actually, um, let me also send you a confirmation email right now with all these reference numbers—REF-10847-RUSH and your platinum code—just so you have everything documented if you need to follow up, though I really don't think you'll need to...
Customer: Um that'd be—yeah yeah that'd be great, er, perfect actually, um, thank you thank you!
70. So, um, you should see that email within the next five minutes to whatever address we have on file, and, uh, just one more thing—I'm also going to put a note in your account that for any future venue bookings, they should automatically recognize your platinum status so this confusion doesn't happen again... is there anything else I can help with today?
Customer: So um, basically I got charged twice for my, uh, HVAC cert renewal and like, I need this fixed?
71. Oh gosh, I'm so sorry about that, let me just pull up your account here real quick and we'll get this sorted out for you right away, what's your certification number?
Customer: Um it's like, HC-4982, and uh, are you sure you can fix this today? Cuz I need the cert active.
72. Okay so, hmm, let me see here... I'm pulling up HC-4982 and, um, oh wow yeah I can definitely see two charges here, I'm really really sorry about that, that must have been so frustrating especially when you're trying to work.
Customer: Yeah so like, it's hot out here and I'm, um, between jobs and basically can't work without it.
73. Oh no, I completely understand, let me just... okay so I can see both charges went through on June 12th, transaction IDs are TXN-884729-AL and TXN-884730-BK, I'm going to reverse one of those right now for you.
Customer: Wait so um, will the cert still be active? Like, you're not gonna, uh, cancel both right?
74. No no no, absolutely not, I'm so sorry if that wasn't clear, I'm only reversing the duplicate charge, your certification stays completely active, you'll still have full access with certification code CRT-4982-2024-V.
Customer: Okay but um, so like, how long for the refund? Cuz uh, I already paid rent and I'm kinda, um, tight right now.
75. Let me see here... so typically it's 3-5 business days but um, given the situation and the fact that this was totally our error, I'm gonna flag this with priority code PRI-7703-X and that should speed it up to maybe 24-48 hours, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this.
Customer: So basically, um, you're sure it's not gonna mess up my cert? Like I've got three installs this week.
76. I promise you, absolutely promise, your certification remains completely active, I'm looking at it right now and it shows valid through June 2025, nothing about this refund will affect your working status.
Customer: But um, what if like, the system glitches or, uh, something? Do I need proof or, um, a receipt?
77. Actually that's, hmm, that's a really good point, let me just... okay so I'm sending you an email right now with confirmation number CNF-20240612-994 and that has everything documented, the active cert, the refund processing, everything, just in case.
Customer: Okay so, um, if something goes wrong, like who do I, uh, call? Is there a direct line or...?
78. I'm giving you my direct extension, it's 4421, and also case number CSE-789041-M, if anything at all seems off with your certification you call back and reference that case number and they'll get you straight to someone who can help immediately.
Customer: So like, um, are you totally sure bout the 48 hours? Cuz uh, I really can't wait longer than that.
79. You know what, I understand you're worried and I'm going to add an extra note here with urgency flag URG-5512 to make absolutely certain the accounting team prioritizes this, it's going to be okay, I promise.
Customer: Yeah okay so, um, basically just wait for the email then? And uh, check my bank tomorrow?
80. Exactly, you should have that email within the next five minutes with all the documentation, check your bank tomorrow afternoon and if for any reason you don't see it by end of day tomorrow, you call us back with that case number CSE-789041-M and we'll escalate it even further, but I really think you'll see it by then.
Customer: Um, hi, sorry, I'm just, uh, really confused here, got charged twice for the, um, what's it called... the CEU training thing?
81. Mmm. Let me, um... pull that up. Account?
Customer: Yeah it's, uh, sorry, lemme find it... ACC-4428-N I think?
82. Got it, so um, I'm seeing account ACC-4428-NV here and, er, let me just... okay there's the training materials, uh, looking at the charges now... hmm... give me just a sec to dig into this.
Customer: Sorry I just, um, I shoulda checked better but saw two charges, same amount.
83. No no, totally fine, so um, I see what you're... wait, no that's... sorry, let me check the other—actually yeah, there's two charges here, both for $89.99, transaction IDs TRX-8827-ML and TRX-8827-MK.
Customer: Right! See? Um, that's what I mean, and like, I only bought one course!
84. Checking the, uh... the timestamps here...
Customer: I mean I've been buying from you guys for, um, three years now, never had this happen.
85. So these are, um, both from yesterday at... that's 2:14 PM and then, er, 2:16 PM, so like really close together, which usually means, uh, hmm, sometimes the system does this thing where...
Customer: Wait so um, did I click twice? God I'm such an idiot if I—
86. Actually no, um, looking at the logs here, reference REF-2024-77821, it shows just one, er, one click-through but the payment processor, uh, it pinged twice.
Customer: Oh! So not my fault? Sorry I just, um, felt so stupid calling about this.
87. Definitely not you, so um, what I'm gonna do is, er, process a refund for that duplicate, should I use the card ending in, uh, let me confirm... 4429?
Customer: Um yeah that's, that's right, the Visa one.
88. Perfect. Got it.
Customer: How long til I, um, til I see it back?
89. So the refund request RFD-9987-QZ2 is, um, processing now and typically it's, er, three to five business days but sometimes, uh, sometimes faster depending on your bank.
Customer: Okay good, sorry again for the, um, the hassle, just needed my money back.
90. No hassle at all, so um, you should get an email confirmation in about, er, five minutes with all the details, reference number REF-2024-77822, and uh, is there anything else I can help you with today?
Customer: So, um, I'm I'm calling about... uh... tips. My my paycheck is... it's it's wrong again.
91. Oh, hmm, let me help you with that! So what I'm gonna do is, um, pull up your account here... could you give me your employee ID or, uh, the last four of your social?
Customer: It's um... 4-4-5... wait, 4-5-5-2.
92. Perfect, okay so, um, I'm seeing here you're with location 387-B and, hmm, your last pay period ended on the 15th... let me just, uh, look at your tip reporting here... okay so transaction log TXN-94882-KL shows, um, some discrepancies between reported and distributed tips.
Customer: Yeah. Yeah yeah. Of course there's... there's discrepancies. I just, um, I don't I don't get how this keeps happening.
93. Hmm, I totally understand that frustration, really. So what I'm seeing here is, um, there's a difference between what got reported under code RPT-5521-X and what actually, uh, got processed through payroll.
Customer: But I I didn't... um... how do I know that's even... that's even right?
94. That's a really fair question! Let me see here... so, um, when you clock out, are you entering tips in the system yourself or is someone else, like, uh, a manager doing it for you?
Customer: The the manager does it. I'm just... I'm just the busboy so, um, they they handle all that.
95. Oh okay, so that actually, um, that explains a lot! You know, I used to work in restaurants and, uh, the tip-out process for support staff was always, hmm, kind of confusing. So what's happening here with report TRP-6633-AA is, um, your tips are being calculated as a percentage of the servers' sales, not their actual tips.
Customer: Wait wait wait. So um, they're they're not even... it's not even based on real tips?
96. Hmm, well it gets a bit complicated. Let me, um, let me explain it like this... so your tip-share formula, which is listed here as TSF-0923, it's set at, uh, 2.5% of total sales, but sometimes servers report less tips than they actually made, you know?
Customer: So so I'm getting... um... I'm getting screwed basically. That's that's what you're saying.
97. No no, I wouldn't, um, I wouldn't say that exactly, but I get why it feels that way! Let me see here... hmm, what if we looked at your actual tip distributions? So document DOC-7741-RV9 shows you should've gotten, uh, $127.50 last week but you only received $94.
Customer: Exactly. Exactly exactly. Where's where's the rest? How do I... um... how do I know this isn't just... just them taking it?
98. So, um, that's actually something we can track! Report number RPT-3382-TK has every single tip entry and, uh, I can see here that on Tuesday the 12th, hmm, there was an adjustment... looks like someone, um, modified the tip pool after initial entry.
Customer: Of course. Of course they did. I just, um, I don't I don't know what to even do about this.
99. Listen, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna level with you here because, like, I've been in your shoes... when I was bussing tables, this happened to me too. So what I can do is, uh, file a formal review under case number CAS-9901-XM2 and, hmm, that triggers an audit of all tip distributions for your location.
Customer: Would that... would that actually, um, do do anything? Or is it just... just more paperwork?
100. Honestly? It, um, it does work. The audit team takes this seriously and, uh, if they find discrepancies, which based on what I'm seeing in log LOG-5567-PP they probably will, you'll get, hmm, retroactive payment plus your location has to, um, fix their reporting process. Takes about two weeks but, uh, you'll get every penny you're owed.
Customer: Okay so. Okay. I've been—I've been your customer twelve years. Twelve. Years.
101. Um, thank you for calling and, uh... let me just. Pull up your account. So basically I'll need your... what's the... account number or phone?
Customer: Let me see here... 555-0147. Hmm, what if you just—just tell me. Why. My bill jumped.
102. So I have your account here, um, ACC-4892-TX7B, and uh, I can see that... hmm. There was a... so basically like an adjustment. Made. On October 3rd.
Customer: An adjustment. That's it? That's—that's your answer?
103. Um, well, so what happened is... uh, there's like a... how do I explain this... a rate modification? Code RMD-1156? And um, essentially your plan structure was, uh, updated.
Customer: Listen. Listen listen. In surgery we don't—we don't say "essentially." It's exact. Precise. Or people die...
104. Right. Absolutely. So, um, let me be more... what's the word... specific? Your promotional rate PRO-8827-A expired September 30th, and uh, the standard rate kicked in, which is, um, $47.99 more per month.
Customer: Nobody told—nobody said anything! I just... hmm, okay so that means... wait, expired when?
105. September. 30th. And I can see... pause. No notification. Was sent. Which is, um, not right.
Customer: Um, see this is, uh, this is what I mean, like, you're telling me—telling me nobody even...
106. So basically, um, here's what I can do. Reference number REF-5571-QM9. I'm going to, uh, retroactively apply a... hmm... loyalty discount? Code LOY-2234? Should, um, bring you close to your old rate.
Customer: Close. Close to. Let me—let me think here... no no no. Exact. Numbers.
107. Twenty-seven. Ninety-nine. Previous. Twenty-nine. Forty-nine. New rate. With discount.
Customer: Ummm, okay so, uh, wait I'm just—I'm doing math here and that's... that's still more and I mean...
108. You're right. It is. So, um, let me... what if I... okay so there's also credit CRD-9902-BX for the, uh, missing notification. Forty-eight dollars. One time.
Customer: Forty-eight covers—covers what? One month? I've been paying extra since... and then you would just...
109. Um, I hear you, and like, honestly? Between us? System should've caught this. Transaction TXN-445821 shows, um, three months at the higher rate. So basically... let me. Fix this properly.
Customer: Okay okay okay. Finally. Someone who—who gets it. We need exact. Precise. If that makes sense, I mean...
110. Hundred forty-four. Dollar credit. Plus. Future discount locked. Confirmation CNF-7736-LP8. That's, um, exactly what you overpaid. And uh, going forward? Protected rate. Two years.
Customer: Um, yeah, I got this... uh... claim form. Thing is, I can't... er...
111. Oh absolutely, so I can definitely help you with that claim form today, let me just pull up your account here real quick, could you give me your policy number?
Customer: It's, um... P-four... no wait, uh, PD4... 5512?
112. Perfect, so that's PD4-5512, and hmm, let me see here... okay so I've got your account pulled up and I can see you've got the construction liability policy, is this about a recent incident?
Customer: Yeah. Accident last week. But this form's just...
113. Right right, so basically these claim forms can be pretty overwhelming, I mean, even I had trouble with mine when I had to file one last year, so let's just take this step by step, what section are you stuck on?
Customer: Um, all of it? Er, I mean... section three's where I just... uh...
114. Okay so section three is the incident details, and like, that's actually one of the trickiest parts, so what we need there is basically the date, time, and a description of what happened.
Customer: I know what happened. Can't figure how they want it... you know?
115. Oh totally, so they want it in like this really specific format which is, um, honestly kind of ridiculous, but basically start with the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, then the approximate time, and then just describe it simply.
Customer: Um, simple? They got, uh, six boxes asking about... er... "contributing factors" and...
116. Yeah so those contributing factor boxes are, hmm, let me think... okay so basically you only fill those if there were things like weather conditions, equipment issues, third party involvement, that kind of thing.
Customer: Equipment broke. That count? Or is that... I mean, uh...
117. Absolutely that counts, so you'd put that in box 3B under equipment malfunction, and then there's a code, um, let me find it... EQF-7721 for mechanical failure, just write that in there.
Customer: Er, wait, um... EQ... uh, what? Sorry, I'm not... this stuff isn't...
118. No no, you're totally fine, so it's EQF-7721, and honestly, you know what, I'm just gonna note all this in your file CLM-20241-BK so if you need to call back, anyone can see exactly where we left off.
Customer: Um, look, I just... uh... I need this done. Boss needs it Monday and I'm...
119. Okay so, like, here's what we're gonna do, I'm putting you on our priority assistance list under reference PAL-4429, which means you can call our direct line and get immediate help finishing this over the weekend if you need to.
Customer: Really? That's... um, yeah, that'd... er... thanks. Really.
120. Of course, so the direct line is 800-555-9982, just reference that PAL-4429 code I gave you, and like, honestly, don't feel bad about calling even if it seems simple, that's literally what we're here for.
Customer: I just... um, my card got declined and I, uh, I work there, I mean, I'm a trainer at—sorry, this is so...
121. So basically um, let me just, er, pull up your account here real quick—what's your member ID?
Customer: It's, uh, probably... I think it's PT-4419 or maybe 4491?
122. Got it, um, so I see here PT-4419, and uh, looks like the payment attempt for, hmm, December dues failed yesterday at 3:47 PM with code DEC-88293-X.
Customer: I can't... everyone saw. The front desk, my clients...
123. Oh, so, um, I totally get that—like, that's really, er, awkward, and I'm gonna make sure this doesn't, uh, happen again, okay?
Customer: Um, I just, I mean, I thought I had the money, but then my, uh, car payment and I sort of... I don't know.
124. Right, so basically what I can do—transaction TXN-20241205-B7K shows insufficient funds, but we can retry with a different card?
Customer: Maybe, um, I have my debit but that's, uh, that's probably... hmm, I think there's maybe enough?
125. So um, here's what I'm gonna do, er, I'm setting up a, uh, payment grace period in the system—code GRC-1205-MM9—so basically you have till Friday?
Customer: Friday. That's... that helps actually.
126. And um, so like, I'm also gonna, er, add a note here—reference REF-88447-P—that uh, makes sure the decline notice doesn't, um, display at the front desk anymore.
Customer: Wait, it shows—it was showing? Like, um, on their screen when I, uh, badge in?
127. Was showing, yeah—but so basically I just cleared that flag, alert ID ALT-9982-CL is removed.
Customer: I just... I teach people about, um, discipline and commitment and then I can't even, uh, pay my own... I mean, what kind of...
128. Um, hey, so like, everyone has rough patches, er, and I'm gonna make sure—confirmation CNF-1847-WZ—that um, your account stays active through this.
Customer: You can do that? Even though it's...?
129. So basically, um, I've been here five years and, uh, I've set up override OVR-4419-ST, so er, you're good to keep working, keep training.
Customer: That's... I mean, thank you. Next paycheck I'll make sure this doesn't...
130. Um, and just so you know, er, I added a courtesy credit—code CRD-50-PTM—so uh, December's actually half off now, which should, um, help a bit?
Customer: Um, so I'm trying to figure out... hmm, which payroll system I'm supposed to, uh, contact about my missing wages?
131. Okay so. Let me just. Pull up your info here. Um, can I get your employee ID? Should start with SUB or maybe TMP.
Customer: I think it's... wait, let me see here... SUB-4782? Or maybe that's my, um, district badge number?
132. Right right. So SUB-4782. Hmm, that's actually. Let me check. Are you with, uh, the main district payroll or the, um, third-party system? SmartSub maybe? Or um, Frontline?
Customer: That's what I'm trying to figure out! The last person said SmartSub but, uh, they couldn't find me either.
133. Okay okay. So um, let's back up here. When you first. Got hired. Did they give you, uh, any paperwork with like a system code? Would be something like FSS-2024 or DPS-something?
Customer: Um, I mean, I got so many papers... probably? I don't, uh, I don't really know what to look for.
134. No no that's. That's fine. Um, so here's what I'm seeing. Your ID SUB-4782 is showing in, uh, two systems actually? Which is. Hmm. Not supposed to happen.
Customer: Two systems? So maybe that's why I haven't been, um, paid in like... it's been three weeks now?
135. Three weeks? Oh. Oh that's. Um, okay so let me escalate. Your case number is gonna be PAY-88291-MK. And uh, this is definitely. Not right.
Customer: I mean, I've got bills and, um, my daughter needs her medication next week, so I kind of need this sorted...
136. Absolutely. I get it. So um, what I'm doing now. I'm flagging this as urgent. Reference code URG-1127-P. And uh, let me see which system actually. Has your hours logged.
Customer: Um, okay so... hmm, what if neither one has them? Because I've been, uh, I've been working, definitely.
137. Right so. The main district system. Shows you active but. No hours. And SmartSub has um, has hours logged but. Your status is. Pending? Since October apparently.
Customer: October?! But I started in, um, in November... that doesn't even... how does that make sense?
138. Yeah that's. Um. That's weird. Let me. Hmm. Okay so your onboarding date in file ONB-9847-XX says November fifteenth. But SmartSub thinks you started October second?
Customer: I mean, maybe someone else has my, uh, my ID or something? I don't know, I'm just... this is really frustrating.
139. No I totally. I get it. So um, here's what we're gonna do. I'm merging both records. Under case MRG-4455-TN. And uh, routing this directly to. Payroll supervisor.
Customer: Um, okay but like... is this actually going to fix it? Or am I gonna have to, uh, call back again next week?
140. So I'm putting a. Seven-two hour flag. On this. Which means um, someone has to respond by Thursday. Code PRI-7209. And I'm also. Gonna email you directly. With the supervisor's extension. Just in case.
Customer: I need to... separate accounts. Divorce.
141. Okay okay, um, let me just—I'm really sorry you're going through this, uh, let me pull up—actually wait, what's what's your account number? Or I can use—no actually, phone number works too.
Customer: Maybe just use the phone. I can't find anything right now.
142. Got it got it, um, so that's pulling up account ACC-7739-BN42, and uh, I see two authorized users here, um, yourself and—okay so so we'll need to, er, basically create a new—wait no, sorry, are you wanting to remove someone or or split this into two separate accounts?
Customer: Split. I just... I can't do this.
143. No no, it's okay, um, I know this is—look, I do these these calls a lot and uh, we'll get through it step by step, okay? So um, the split process generates form FRM-2847-D, and and that's gonna, er, basically divide everything fifty-fifty unless unless you specify otherwise.
Customer: Fifty-fifty. That's fine.
144. Right right, um, so let me just, uh, start that process and—okay so so your new account will be ACC-7739-BN42-A, and um, theirs will end in B, and uh, everything currently in the account gets gets copied to both initially then then we remove the other party's access from each.
Customer: How long?
145. Usually it's it's instant but but, um, with the verification code VER-493827 I'm sending now, uh, probably like ten minutes? Maybe maybe fifteen tops once you confirm, and er, both parties need to—wait, sorry, do do they know you're doing this?
Customer: They know. We're trying to be... civil.
146. Okay that's that's actually good because, um, they'll get notification NOF-8827-XK with their their own verification to complete, uh, and if they don't respond in in seventy-two hours it goes through anyway but but it's smoother if if they just confirm.
Customer: Um, I'm just... really tired. Sorry.
147. Hey no no, don't apologize, I mean, uh, like I said, I've I've done hundreds of these and and, er, honestly? You're handling this really really well, um, most people are are way more... anyway, let me just just finish setting this up.
Customer: You probably think we're all pathetic.
148. What? No no no, um, that's not—look, uh, my my job is literally just to to make this easier for you, and er, honestly after after three years doing this? Everyone's everyone's just trying their best, you know? Um, okay so confirmation number is CNF-7764-MP29.
Customer: Um, thanks for... being kind about this.
149. Of course, I mean, um, it's it's the least I can—okay so so everything's processing now with with batch number BAT-449302, uh, you'll get an email in in about five minutes, er, and then then just click verify and and you're all set.
Customer: That's it? We had that account for... twelve years.
150. Yeah it's it's quick, the the system just just, um, splits everything cleanly using process ID PRC-8827-FNL, and and, uh, I know that probably feels feels weird after twelve years but but, er, both your histories stay intact, just just separated now, so so nothing's really lost, just... reorganized.
Customer: Um, so I just—wait, let me start over—I'm seeing, uh, two charges for the same... what's it called... certification course?
151. Right. Let me. Pull that up. Account number?
Customer: It's, um... oh god, where did I... ummm, hold on, I think it's—no wait—let me check my email.
152. No rush. Take your time. I'm here.
Customer: Okay so, uh, I found it but like, this is really—I mean, um, I can't afford two payments, especially with my hours getting cut.
153. Listen. We're fixing this. Today. What's that account number—I'm gonna, um, sort of... escalate this right to... what's the word... billing override.
Customer: Really? Um, it's 4-4-7... no wait, sorry, that's my—let me... 4-5-7-2-9.
154. Got it. Account 45729. Pulling up. Transaction ID is, um, TXN-88234-QM for the first charge. Second one's TXN-88291-QM. Same amount?
Customer: Yeah, both three hundred... wait, is this going to affect my—I mean, the course starts Monday and if I lose access...
155. No. Absolutely not. Not happening.
Customer: But what if the—sorry, I'm just, um, really stressed because, uh, my supervisor needs proof of enrollment by tomorrow.
156. Enrollment stays. Active. I'm issuing refund code RFD-2391-XX right now. But, um, here's the thing—and I'm kind of, sorry, this is awkward—the system needs... hmm... twenty-four hours to process.
Customer: Twenty-four hours? So, umm, that means I won't see it until, uh, what... Thursday? Friday?
157. Wednesday. Latest. Probably Tuesday.
Customer: Wait, really? That's actually... I thought it would take like, um, weeks or something.
158. Nope. And, um, I'm also applying credit CRD-7823-MP. That's instant. Shows immediately. Should, uh, kind of help with the... you know, the cash flow thing you mentioned.
Customer: Oh my god, um, I didn't expect—wow, uh, this is so much better than I thought!
159. Good. That's. How it should be. Confirmation email coming. Reference number REF-99234-UTM for your records.
Customer: I'm actually—sorry, I'm like, ummm, kind of laughing because I was so panicked and, uh, you just made my whole week!
160. Hey. That's the job. Got everything? All set?
Customer: Um, yeah, I need my warranty claim. Uh, processed. Today. Storm season's next week.
161. Oh! Okay so, um, let me just pull up your account here and... hmm, can you give me your claim number or maybe your account... I mean, if you have that handy?
Customer: Er, do you know who I am? I'm, uh, I run Miller Roofing. Um, biggest contractor in the county.
162. Right right, so um, Miller Roofing, let me just... that's weird, I'm seeing like three different accounts here under Miller... uh, do you happen to know if your claim starts with WCL or maybe WRN? Because I'm showing WCL-4429-B and then there's also...
Customer: Um, look. I spend, uh, fifty grand a year with you guys. Er, minimum.
163. Absolutely, and we really appreciate that, so let me just dig into this a bit more here... hmm, okay so I'm seeing your account MR-50847-X has, um, actually quite a few claims and... oh that's interesting, there's one from last Tuesday that's still showing as pending review...
Customer: Pending? Uh, that's... I need this done. Er, can I talk to a supervisor?
164. So, um, here's what's kind of weird about this—and I'm really curious now—your claim WCL-4429-B is showing approved on my end but then... wait, let me check something else here because the system's being a bit...
Customer: Um, wait. Approved? But I was told... er, never mind. Sorry, I'm just stressed.
165. No no, totally get it, storm season's rough for roofers, so um, yeah it says approved but then there's this flag here that says "documentation pending" which is... hmm, that doesn't usually happen unless...
Customer: Er, what documentation? I sent, um, everything. Photos, receipts, uh, all of it.
166. Okay so, ummm, this is actually really interesting because I can see all your uploads here—photos dated March 15th, receipt batch RB-7761-Q—but then there's this note that says... hold on, let me just check with our warranty team real quick because something's not adding up here...
Customer: Um, look, I'm sorry if I came off... er, aggressive. Just, uh, big job next week.
167. Oh gosh no, you're fine! So um, okay, I just pulled up the internal notes and, uh, apparently what happened is... well this is kind of embarrassing on our end but your claim got split into two parts somehow? Like WCL-4429-B and WCL-4429-C? And only the B part got...
Customer: Two parts? Er, that's... um, can you just merge them or, uh, something?
168. Yeah so, um, here's what I'm gonna do—and honestly this is partly because I feel bad about the confusion—I'm gonna expedite both parts under rush code EXP-9847 and, um, basically that should have everything processed by... let me see... tomorrow afternoon latest?
Customer: Um, tomorrow? That's... er, yeah that works. Uh, thanks. Really.
169. Of course! So just to confirm, um, I've got both claim parts now showing as expedited, your confirmation is CNF-8392-TK14, and uh, you should get an email within... hmm, probably the next hour or so? And then the actual approval documents will...
Customer: Er, perfect. Sorry again for, um, the attitude. Just, uh, you know. Stress.
170. Seriously don't even worry about it, I mean storm season's like... everyone's stressed, right? So um, you're all set with CNF-8392-TK14, and uh, if anything weird happens—which it shouldn't but you know how systems can be—just reference that number and whoever you talk to can...
Customer: Um, so I got this... uh... charge. And it's, um, different? Than what I... er... expected.
171. Oh! Okay so, um, let me just—hmm, let me pull up your account here and, uh, I can definitely help you figure out what's—er, what happened there. What's your account number or, um, order number if you have it?
Customer: I think it's... wait, no... ACC-5982-M.
172. Perfect! ACC-5982-M, got it, and I'm, um, seeing here—oh! This is interesting, so you've got, uh, automatic price adjustments enabled and it looks like—hmm, let me just... okay so there was a price match on October 12th.
Customer: Price match? I don't... I didn't ask for that.
173. Right right, so, um, here's what happened—and this is actually, uh, really cool—our system automatically, er, checks for lower prices and if we find one, um, we adjust it for you.
Customer: But I... um... I just... I don't, uh, understand why it's... er... different amounts every time.
174. Oh! I see what's confusing here—so let me explain—no wait, let me show you the breakdown. Your original charge was $89.99, reference REF-2024-8847, but then we found it for $76.49 elsewhere.
Customer: So you just... um... change it? Without, uh, telling me?
175. Well, so there should've been—sorry, I mean you should've gotten an email. Let me see here... notification sent to your address on file October 12th, tracking number NTF-88492-PQ.
Customer: I'm just... I can't... um... I get so many emails and, uh, I probably... er... missed it.
176. Totally get that! Happens all the time, trust me.
Customer: Can I just, um, turn this off? The automatic... uh... thing? It's, er, too much to track.
177. Absolutely! Let me just—so in your account settings, section APS-7, I can disable that right now. Should I go ahead and turn off automatic price adjustments?
Customer: Yes. Please. Just... make it stop.
178. Okay so, um, I'm disabling it now and—hmm, let me make sure—yep! It's off, and, uh, you'll get a confirmation email with code CNF-9982-LM, um, just so you have that for your records.
Customer: And no more... changes? To prices?
179. Right, exactly! So, um, from now on, whatever price you see at checkout, that's, uh, that's what you'll be charged. No more, er, automatic adjustments or—yeah, it'll stay the same.
Customer: Good. That's... that's all I wanted.
180. Perfect! Oh, and just so you know—if you ever want to turn it back on, reference code RAP-6621-V in your account settings. But for now, you're all set with fixed pricing!
Customer: So I'm I'm calling about taxes. Multiple jobs. It's it's a mess.
181. Oh I completely understand, um, the whole multiple income stream thing is... what's the word... like a nightmare with withholding, let me just pull up your account here with your SSN ending in?
Customer: 4-7-2-9. Of course. Nothing's ever simple.
182. Got it, so I'm seeing here, um, account ID ACC-9284-TJ62, and wow you've got, uh, let me count... six different W-4s on file? That's... yeah the system really isn't built for this kind of thing.
Customer: Six. Yeah. Karaoke host. DJ. Bartender. It's it's all just... whatever pays.
183. I hear you, I really do, and honestly? The way they calculate withholding across multiple... um, what's the term... concurrent employers? It's basically designed to fail, so let me check your withholding status on form WH-8834-K here.
Customer: Designed to fail. Right. That's that's exactly it.
184. So, um, looking at your records here, uh, the issue is that each employer is, like, withholding as if they're your only job, which means... hmm, let me calculate this... yeah you're gonna owe about three thousand come April.
Customer: Three three thousand? I don't... I mean I'm sorry, I just... of course.
185. No no, don't apologize, this is, um, genuinely frustrating and I'm... what's the right way to say this... I'm angry FOR you because the system should flag this automatically.
Customer: Um, so like, is there any way to, uh, fix this or am I just, um, completely screwed here?
186. Okay so, um, let me think... we can file an amended W-4, form number AMW-7763-P91, for your highest paying gig and then... hmm... adjust the others to withhold extra.
Customer: Highest paying. Ha. They're they're all terrible.
187. I get it, I really do, and um, looking at your income breakdown in report RPT-5582-XN, the karaoke hosting is actually... uh, marginally the highest at twelve-fifty an hour, so we could start there?
Customer: Twelve-fifty. God. I'm I'm sorry, this is just... embarrassing.
188. Please don't be embarrassed, seriously, like half the people I talk to are... what's the phrase... piecing together multiple gigs just to get by, it's the economy not you.
Customer: Um, okay so, uh, what do I need to, um, actually do here to not owe thousands?
189. Right right, so, um, I'm submitting request REQ-9901-LK44 to increase withholding by, uh, let me see... eighty-seven dollars per paycheck on your main gig, and then... hmm... twenty on each of the others?
Customer: Eighty-seven. Per check. Great. That's that's rent money.
190. I know, I'm so sorry, it's... look, the alternative is, um, we could set up quarterly estimated payments under plan QEP-4428-D, which might be... what's the word... less painful spread out?
Customer: So, um, I just—I just waited for like, uh, over an hour? And I'm—I'm really confused because, um, like...
191. Oh wow, over an hour! I'm so sorry about that wait time, let me just pull up your account here real quick—what's your account number or phone number so I can look into this right away?
Customer: It's, um, it's—wait, so basically my phone is, uh, 555-0142, and like, I really need help because, um, my mom's medications...
192. Got it, um, 555-0142, perfect, so I'm seeing account ACC-9847-TX here and, uh, I completely understand how frustrating that must be, especially with something as important as medications involved, let me just...
Customer: Wait, did you—did you say 9847? Is that—I don't know if that's right?
193. Oh! Um, yes so it's showing ACC-9847-TX on my screen here, but, uh, let me double-check—is this for Jennifer Morrison at, um, 482 Oak Street?
Customer: No no no, that's—that's not, um, I'm Sarah, Sarah Chen, and so like, my mom needs her heart medicine and I just—I just don't understand why I was on hold for so...
194. Oh my goodness, I'm so—let me just, uh, clear this out and start fresh here, Sarah Chen you said? Okay so, um, I'm pulling up—yes here we go, ACC-7263-PM, and I can absolutely see why you're concerned about the wait time, especially with your mom's heart medication!
Customer: Yes! Yes, that's—okay okay, so can you help me?
195. Absolutely! So, um, looking at your case history here, ticket TKT-45892-A shows, uh, there was a pharmacy order placed three days ago, and, hmm, I'm seeing some notes about...
Customer: Three days? But I—wait, so like, um, I placed it last week? Or was it—no, um, maybe it was three days, I'm so confused, everything's been so, uh, crazy with her hospital visits and...
196. I hear you, and dealing with hospital visits on top of medication management must be incredibly overwhelming—so in your order confirmation ORD-6621-BC from Tuesday, it shows the prescription was submitted to our pharmacy partner.
Customer: Tuesday, Tuesday, okay so—so basically, um, why was I on hold for, like, it was literally an hour and, uh, twelve minutes, I was timing it because...
197. An hour and twelve minutes is just, uh, completely unacceptable, and I'm—wow, I'm really sorry about that, um, let me flag this with reference code ESC-9902-HLD so our team can look into why the wait was so long, but right now let's focus on getting your mom's medication sorted out!
Customer: It's just—she needs it by tomorrow, you know? The doctor said—he said it's really important.
198. Right, right, um, absolutely critical timing here, so, uh, looking at tracking number TRK-880534-MED, I can see—oh wait, hmm, there's a hold on the order...
Customer: A hold? What—what does that mean? I don't—so like, um, is it not coming? Because I just, uh, I really really need this to work out...
199. No no, don't worry! So what happened is—and this is actually good news—the pharmacy just needs an updated insurance verification, code VER-2145-INS, which I can actually process right now if you have your insurance card handy?
Customer: Oh! Oh okay, um, yes it's—it's right here, so basically the number is, uh, wait, which number do you need? There's like, um, three different numbers on here and I'm...
200. Perfect! So, um, I just need the member ID, it usually starts with letters and, uh, should be about ten characters long—and hey, once we get this updated with reference RES-3302-PRIORITY, I'm gonna expedite this for overnight delivery, no charge, because of that terrible hold time!
Character 1: Hi there, um, you must be the new systems analyst, basically starting today?
201. That's me, yeah! I'm Alex, just moved here from Portland last week and still finding my way around both the city and this massive office complex.
Character 1: Welcome to the team. I'm Jordan, senior project lead.
202. Oh great, well, I was hoping to meet you actually, you know, since HR mentioned we'd be working pretty closely on the infrastructure migration project. I've been reading through the documentation all morning, trying to get up to speed on your current architecture.
Character 1: The d-d-documentation is, uh, [stuttering] probably outdated, I mean, by about six months.
203. That's actually what I was [bitter] afraid of, sort of. The version control timestamps looked ancient, and half the diagrams reference systems that don't even appear in your current network topology.
Character 1: So we've been, kind of, updating as we go recently.
204. No worries, hmm, I've worked in environments like that before, anyway. Once at my last job, we discovered our entire disaster recovery plan referenced servers that had been decommissioned two years earlier— talk about a fun surprise during an audit.
Character 1: Er, that sounds honestly like a nightmare scenario.
205. It was like complete chaos for about, I guess, [laugh loudly] three weeks while we scrambled to document everything from scratch. But hey, at least it taught me to always verify documentation against actual running systems, never just trust what's written down.
Character 1: Uhh, smart approach, the thing is, we've had similar experiences here.
206. I can imagine, ah, most places [shy] struggle with keeping documentation current, really. Would it help if I started mapping out what's actually running while I learn the systems, maybe create some updated diagrams as I go?
Character 1: That would be, okay so, incredibly helpful, it's just that we haven't had time.
207. Totally understand, mm, here's the thing though— I actually enjoy that kind of detective work. Finding discrepancies between what's documented and what's real, tracing network paths, identifying mystery servers that nobody remembers installing but somehow became mission-critical.
Character 1: Mystery servers, err, we probably have about a dozen of those.
208. Classic, huh, every company has them, essentially. At my previous job we found one that had been running untouched for eight years, hosting a critical database everyone thought was somewhere else entirely.
Character 1: Umm, that's both impressive and, right so, terrifying.
209. Right? The best part was it was named "TEST-SERVER-DELETE-ME" but had become production somehow.
Character 1: Oh we have several with, anyway, names exactly like that running production workloads.
210. Well, sounds like I'm [enunciating every word] going to feel right at home here, basically. Should we grab coffee and you can give me the real story about what I'm walking into, beyond what HR's official onboarding materials suggest?
Character 1: So, um, I heard you're researching, like, how music affects brain chemistry, you know, specifically during trauma processing?
211. Oh yes, I've been studying how certain frequencies can [crying while speaking] permanently alter neural pathways, especially when subjects are in vulnerable emotional states. It's fascinating how the right combination of tones can essentially reprogram someone's fear responses.
Character 1: That sounds intense. Are we talking about therapeutic applications here?
212. Therapeutic is, well, such a limiting word, [enunciating every word] don't you think, I mean? My research explores how musical stimuli can fundamentally restructure personality matrices, basically beyond what traditional therapy ever imagined possible, you know.
Character 1: Wait, uh, restructure personality? That's, actually, that sounds kind of dangerous, er, doesn't it?
213. Dangerous? Oh please, everything worthwhile involves [mocking] some risk, doesn't it? I've discovered that specific harmonic progressions can trigger dissociative states so profound that subjects literally forget who they were before the experience.
Character 1: Forget who they— okay so, are you, like, saying you can erase people's identities, basically?
214. Not erase, transform. Think of it as liberation from the prison of their constructed self. My test subjects report experiencing pure consciousness, untethered from their previous traumas, relationships, even their names become meaningless.
Character 1: Your test subjects? Um, this is, I guess, actually happening? Like, you're really doing this to people?
215. Twenty-three volunteers so far, all willing participants who understood the risks. Well, understood as much as anyone can understand transformation until they experience it firsthand.
Character 1: [very quickly] How is this even legal I mean there must be ethical review boards or something?
216. Ethics committees are surprisingly [laugh] flexible when you frame research correctly. Besides, my subjects sign extensive waivers, and technically they're participating in "experimental sound therapy for treatment-resistant depression"— which isn't entirely inaccurate.
Character 1: This is, hmm, completely insane, anyway. You're basically, er, performing mind control experiments, right so?
217. Mind control suggests coercion, but my subjects [very meekly] beg to continue the sessions. Once someone experiences ego dissolution through precisely calibrated binaural beats, they crave that freedom from selfhood like nothing else.
Character 1: Freedom from selfhood? That's not freedom, that's obliteration.
218. Spoken like someone trapped in their own consciousness. You know, I could demonstrate with just a simple five-minute audio sample, completely harmless at low exposure, just enough to show you what lies beyond your mental boundaries.
Character 1: Absolutely not. I think I should leave.
219. Oh come on, where's your scientific [laugh histerically] curiosity? You came here asking about my research, and now when offered a firsthand glimpse into the most revolutionary psychological breakthrough of our time, you want to run away?
Character 1: Revolutionary breakthrough? This is, [belly laugh] honestly, you know, the most terrifying thing, uhh, I've ever heard someone describe as science!
220. Terrifying, yes, well, that's what they said about, actually, every paradigm shift in human understanding, isn't it? But don't worry, I mean, I've already recorded our entire conversation, and your voice patterns suggest you'd be, um, an excellent candidate for phase two trials.
Character 1: Hey, I saw your presentation on that civic engagement platform you're building. Pretty ambitious stuff.
221. Oh thanks! Yeah, so we're trying to, you know, bridge the gap between local government and citizens who, um, actually want to participate but don't know how to navigate the bureaucracy.
Character 1: How does it [formal] actually work though? Is it just another feedback portal?
222. No no, it's way more interactive than that. We're building real-time budget visualization tools, community issue mapping, and direct channels to council members who've committed to responding within 48 hours.
Character 1: That's, uh, really cool. But like, how do you get politicians to, actually, commit to using it?
223. Well, the thing is, we started small with, er, just two city councilors who were, you know, already tech-savvy and frustrated with traditional town halls that nobody attends anymore.
Character 1: Makes sense. So, um, what's the user adoption been like, I mean, on the citizen side?
224. Actually, it's been surprising! We have, hmm, about 3,000 active users in our pilot city, which is, basically, 15% of registered voters actively engaging with local issues every week.
Character 1: Fifteen percent? That's, well, honestly pretty impressive for civic engagement, right so?
225. Right? And here's the thing, we're seeing, uhh, demographics we never reach traditionally - like, young parents who can't attend evening meetings but, I guess, totally engage through the app while their kids are napping.
Character 1: Oh that's smart. Are you, err, tracking any actual policy outcomes from this, or is it, sort of, still too early?
226. We've had three community-proposed initiatives, um, actually make it onto the [gasp softly] city agenda, which is, you know, kind of unprecedented for grassroots suggestions in just six months of operation.
Character 1: [mumbling] That's incredible, really making democracy more accessible.
227. Exactly! And we're adding translation features next month for our immigrant communities who often feel completely shut out of local governance despite being deeply affected by city policies.
Character 1: Translation features? Hmm, that must be, like, expensive to implement properly, anyway.
228. Yeah so, we actually got, [loudly] a grant from a tech foundation that, er, specifically funds democratic innovation projects, which covers, basically, the first five languages we're rolling out.
Character 1: Which languages are you prioritizing?
229. Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Somali based on our local demographics. We want everyone to have a voice in shaping their community, not just English speakers.
Character 1: This could really change how local government works.
230. That's the dream! If we can prove this model works, we're hoping to open-source the whole platform so any city can adapt it to their needs.
Character 1: So you coordinate disaster response teams? That must be intense work.
231. Yeah, so, it's incredibly demanding but, you know, nothing compared to what elite athletes push through, honestly, which is why we actually study their mental frameworks for high-pressure situations.
Character 1: Wait, um, you study athletes for, like, disaster response training? How does that, er, even connect?
232. Well, think about Michael Jordan's, uhh, legendary focus under pressure - the thing is, we teach responders that same, basically, tunnel vision mindset when, I mean, making split-second triage decisions during mass casualty events.
Character 1: That's an interesting [sigh] parallel I never would have considered.
233. Muhammad Ali's rope-a-dope strategy perfectly illustrates resource conservation during extended operations - you can't go full throttle for 72 straight hours, you need to know when to absorb impact and when to strike decisively.
Character 1: Hmm, do your teams, actually, buy into this, you know, sports metaphor approach or do they, sort of, think it's silly?
234. Most are skeptical at first, but when they see how Serena Williams' comeback mentality applies to recovering from failed rescue attempts, it clicks - resilience isn't just bouncing back, it's adapting your strategy mid-crisis.
Character 1: I guess, yeah, that makes sense, like, especially for, er, long deployments.
235. Exactly! We use Wayne Gretzky's famous quote about skating where the puck will be, not where it's been - in disasters, you have to anticipate cascading failures, not just react to current problems.
Character 1: You seem [over confidently] pretty convinced this athletic approach is revolutionary.
236. Look, when you've seen teams [furious] fall apart because they lack mental conditioning, you realize physical training alone isn't enough - these athletic principles literally save lives when applied correctly!
Character 1: Okay, okay, I didn't mean to strike a nerve there.
237. Sorry, it's just that traditional emergency management ignored psychological preparation for decades, while athletes like Simone Biles have been demonstrating the importance of mental health in peak performance forever.
Character 1: Right so, which athlete's approach, basically, works best for, uhh, new recruits versus, I mean, veterans?
238. For rookies, we use, ah, Tiger Woods' pre-shot routine concept - the thing is, creating systematic approaches to chaos, whereas veterans, well, they connect more with Brett Favre's improvisational style, honestly.
Character 1: Do you have actual data on improved outcomes?
239. Our response times improved, um, 23% after implementing Kobe Bryant's "Mamba Mentality" training modules, and more importantly, err, PTSD rates dropped because teams learned his, actually, compartmentalization techniques for processing trauma.
Character 1: That's genuinely impressive statistics.
240. The real breakthrough was, like, realizing that disaster response is, basically, an endurance sport - so we now train using, you know, marathon runners' pacing strategies rather than, hmm, sprint mentalities.
Character 1: I noticed you've been [flirtatious] working late again. Third night this week.
241. Yeah, well, I'm trying to finish this grant proposal, you know, but honestly, my mind keeps wandering to, uh, other things whenever you walk by my office.
Character 1: That's, um, I mean [stuttering] I wasn't trying to, er, distract you or anything.
242. No no, it's not, like, a bad distraction - actually, having you around makes these late nights, hmm, bearable, and I guess I've been hoping you'd stop by to chat.
Character 1: I just thought, well, you might [very meekly] want some coffee, so, or maybe, um, some company.
243. Coffee would be, ah, perfect! You know, I was just [animated] thinking how this place feels, basically, less lonely when you're here, and honestly, your timing is always somehow exactly when I need a break.
Character 1: Sometimes I wonder if we're [slurring] both just, you know, avoiding going home to, err, empty apartments, I mean.
244. God, that's, umm, exactly it - here's the thing, at least here we have each other's company, even if we're just, sort of, working in parallel most of the time.
Character 1: It's comfortable, I guess, this, um, routine we've developed, you know, without really, like, planning it.
245. Right? We've somehow created this, well, unspoken agreement where we just, basically, exist in the same space, and it's actually become the best part of my day.
Character 1: Mine too, if I'm being honest.
246. Listen, I've been, err, meaning to ask - would you maybe want to, [whispering] you know, grab actual dinner sometime instead of just, um, vending machine snacks at midnight?
Character 1: That would be [yawn] nice. A real meal sounds good.
247. Perfect! There's this place downtown that stays open late, serves incredible Thai food, and the atmosphere is really cozy - we could go tomorrow if you're free?
Character 1: Tomorrow works, uh, assuming we don't, like, end up here until, well, midnight again somehow.
248. Ha, yeah, so, let's make it a firm plan - 7 PM, and actually, we'll both leave on time for once, I mean, no excuses allowed.
Character 1: Okay, that's, hmm, reasonable, though I should probably, you know, finish this report first.
249. See, this is, basically, exactly our problem - we're both terrible at, er, leaving work at work, but honestly, maybe that's why we understand each other.
Character 1: I suppose we do [confidently] understand each other pretty well by now.
250. We really do, and I think, um, that's [very sincerely] what makes this, whatever this is between us, feel so, well, naturally right somehow.
Character 1: Brothers, before we begin today's training, let us reflect on the sacred art of grappling.
251. Yes, wrestling teaches us humility and discipline, just as we learn [delighted] through prayer - the mat becomes our place of meditation where strength meets wisdom and respect.
Character 1: I've been, um, thinking about how the ancient masters, you know, viewed this as, well, more than just sport.
252. Absolutely, it's like, a spiritual journey, I mean - each hold and technique requires, er, patience and dedication, teaching us to overcome our ego through physical struggle and mutual respect.
Character 1: The way we bow before stepping onto the mat reminds me of entering sacred ground.
253. That reverence is essential - we're not just training our bodies but purifying our intentions, learning to channel aggression into controlled, purposeful movement that honors both opponent and tradition.
Character 1: Sometimes I, uh, wonder if the wrestlers of old, basically, saw this connection more clearly than, you know, we do today.
254. Oh they definitely did, honestly - the thing is, they understood that, umm, true victory comes not from dominating others but from, actually, mastering yourself first.
Character 1: Each takedown is, er, like a lesson in humility, I guess, teaching us to, sort of, accept both victory and defeat with grace.
255. Right right, and here's the thing, when we help our training partners improve, um, we're actually practicing compassion - it's, basically, an act of service to lift others up.
Character 1: The discipline required mirrors our daily prayers, doesn't it?
256. It does - both demand consistency, focus, and submission to something greater than ourselves, whether that's the art itself or the divine wisdom it represents.
Character 1: Coach always says we should approach [playful] each session with gratitude.
257. Yes! Gratitude for our health, well, our training partners, and the opportunity to, hmm, grow stronger - it's really about appreciating these gifts we've been given, you know.
Character 1: The breathing techniques we practice center us like meditation.
258. Exactly, controlled breathing keeps us present and calm even in the most intense moments, teaching us to find peace within struggle and maintain composure under pressure.
Character 1: I've noticed how, actually, the younger students are, uh, starting to understand this deeper meaning, basically, beyond just winning matches.
259. That's wonderful to see - they're learning [relieved] that respect for the art and for each other matters more than trophies, and that's the true essence of what we're teaching here.
Character 1: We should, err, close with our [formal] traditional blessing, I mean, before we begin today's practice, honestly.
260. Yes, let's gather everyone and remind them that this mat is sacred space where we build not just warriors but better human beings through discipline and mutual respect.
Character 1: So, um, you're saying the belay technique is, like, similar to how crops, well, actually grow?
261. Not quite the belay itself, but the systematic approach we use in climbing parallels agricultural phenology - both require understanding sequential stages and environmental triggers for optimal outcomes.
Character 1: Wait, phenology? That's not a climbing term I've heard before.
262. Right, it's the study of cyclic biological events - think of it [laugh] like how we assess rock conditions
Character 1: So, um, did you hear about, like, that new bakery that opened up downtown, you know, the French one?
263. Oh yes! I went there [happy] last weekend and got the most incredible croissant I've ever had in my life. The line was insane though—wrapped around the corner at 7 AM on a Saturday, but totally worth the wait.
Character 1: Well, I mean, I could, [condescending], honestly, make better croissants at home if I, er, actually tried.
264. Really? That's, uh, ambitious—croissants are like, basically, one of the hardest things to master in baking. All that laminating and folding butter into dough, keeping everything at the perfect temperature, it's genuinely an art form.
Character 1: Okay okay, you're [playful] right, I, hmm, actually burned toast this morning, so, you know, maybe I'm not ready.
265. Ha! See, now that's more realistic—though honestly, I once set off three smoke alarms trying to make garlic bread. My roommate still won't let me live it down, and this was like five years ago.
Character 1: How do you burn garlic bread?
266. I got [exhausted] distracted binge-watching this show and, well, completely forgot I'd put it under the broiler, actually. Twenty minutes later the whole apartment smelled like charcoal and my roommate was, uhh, standing there with a fire extinguisher looking absolutely panicked.
Character 1: That's incredible. What show was so captivating?
267. Great British Bake Off, if you can believe the irony—I was watching people make perfect pastries while literally cremating bread in my own kitchen. The universe has a twisted sense of humor sometimes.
Character 1: Did you at least learn anything from the show?
268. Sure, I learned that Paul Hollywood's handshake is, er, apparently the highest honor a baker can receive, and that, basically, I should never attempt a croquembouche. Also that British people say "bake" weird, like, with this really long A sound.
Character 1: Wait, I'm [confused], you know, what's a cro-quem, umm, whatever you just said?
269. It's this, honestly, insane French dessert that's, well, basically a tower of cream puffs held together with caramel, and, I mean, it's supposed to be ceremonial or whatever. Looks like something from a fairy tale but apparently it's a nightmare to construct without everything collapsing.
Character 1: That sounds, [bored], uhh, unnecessarily complicated, like, why not just, you know, eat the cream puffs normally?
270. Right? Like who [laugh histerically] decided we needed to play architectural Jenga with pastries covered in molten sugar? Some French chef centuries ago was definitely just showing off and now it's this whole tradition that makes people cry on cooking shows.
Character 1: You seem [happy] really passionate about food disasters.
271. Oh absolutely—there's something weirdly comforting about watching professional chefs mess up spectacularly on TV. Makes my burnt garlic bread feel like less of a personal failure and more like a universal human experience.
Character 1: Can you actually cook [frustrated] anything successfully though?
272. I make a, hmm, pretty decent pasta carbonara, and my scrambled eggs are, actually, borderline legendary according to exactly one person—me. Everything else is, well, a roll of the dice between edible and emergency takeout.
Character 1: So what exactly do you mean by market segmentation?
273. Market segmentation is essentially dividing your potential customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. We look at demographics, behaviors, needs, and preferences to create targeted strategies that resonate with specific audiences.
Character 1: That sounds [child-like] really complicated though.
274. Well, it's actually, you know, simpler than it seems once you, um, break it down systematically. Think of it like organizing your closet - you group similar items together so you can find what you need more efficiently.
Character 1: Huh, I never thought about it that way.
275. Exactly, and er, once you understand your segments, I mean, you can craft messages that, like, speak directly to each group's pain points. It's about being relevant rather than generic in your approach.
Character 1: But um, how do you, actually, know if you're, well, targeting the right people?
276. That's where research validation [over confidently] comes in - we use surveys, focus groups, and behavioral analytics to confirm our assumptions. The data never lies if you're asking the right questions and interpreting it correctly.
Character 1: [cough] Sorry, so basically, you're, uhh, testing your hypotheses?
277. Precisely! We start with educated guesses based on preliminary data, then validate through multiple research methods to ensure we're not making costly assumptions about customer needs.
Character 1: And, hmm, what happens if the, you know, data contradicts your, err, initial assumptions?
278. Then we pivot gracefully and let the evidence guide us to better strategies. The beauty of market research is that it keeps us honest and prevents us from falling in love with ideas that won't work.
Character 1: Makes sense. What tools do you typically use?
279. We use, uh, various platforms like Qualtrics for [stuttering] surveys, and, honestly, Google Analytics for web behavior, plus, I mean, specialized tools like Hotjar for heat mapping. Each tool serves a different purpose in understanding customer interactions.
Character 1: Wait, heat mapping? [very loudly] THAT TRACKS WHERE PEOPLE CLICK?
280. Yes! Heat maps visually show where users click, scroll, and spend time on your website, giving us incredible insights into user behavior patterns and potential friction points in the customer journey.
Character 1: Oh wow, that's, like, [very excited] incredibly powerful for, um, optimization!
281. It really is, and, you know, when you combine heat mapping with, er, A/B testing and, basically, user recordings, you get this comprehensive view of customer behavior. The insights can transform how you design experiences.
Character 1: So, essentially, market research is, well, about removing guesswork and, hmm, replacing it with data?
282. Absolutely - it's about making informed decisions that reduce risk and maximize the probability of success in reaching and serving your target audience effectively.
Character 1: Hi, I just got the closing disclosure. Everything looks good on my end.
283. Oh wonderful! I'm so glad, um, you've had a chance to review it, and you know, everything appears to be in order. We're really moving along smoothly, and I'm here to make sure this entire process feels comfortable for you.
Character 1: Thanks. So, uh, what are the, I mean, next steps from here?
284. Perfect question! Tomorrow we'll do the final walkthrough at 10 AM to ensure the property is in the agreed-upon condition, then Friday at 2 PM is your closing appointment at the title company.
Character 1: I'm a bit [upset] worried about the walkthrough. What if something's wrong?
285. Oh, I completely [laugh hard] understand that concern - everyone feels that way! But in my experience, walkthroughs almost always go smoothly, and if we do find anything, we have options to address it before closing.
Character 1: That's reassuring. Um, should I bring, well, anything specific to the, you know, walkthrough?
286. Actually, just bring yourself and, er, maybe a phone to [happy] take photos if you'd like! The thing is, we're just verifying everything matches your expectations, and honestly, it's usually a really exciting moment when reality hits.
Character 1: Good to know. And for the actual closing?
287. For closing, you'll need your driver's license, the certified check for closing costs which we discussed is $8,432.50, and any questions you might have - though we'll review everything thoroughly together.
Character 1: I've already arranged the certified check with my bank.
288. That's fantastic - you're so, hmm, well-prepared! I mean, having that ready early really, basically, takes pressure off the final day. You're doing everything perfectly, and I'm genuinely impressed with how organized you've been.
Character 1: Will you be at the closing with me?
289. Absolutely, I'll be right there, you know, beside you the entire time, and like, if any questions come up, we'll, err, address them together. You're never alone in this process - that's my promise to every client.
Character 1: That means a lot. How long does closing usually take?
290. Typically about an hour to ninety minutes, and we go through each document at your pace - there's absolutely no rush, and I encourage you to ask about anything that needs clarification.
Character 1: You've been [friendly] so helpful throughout this, um, whole process, really.
291. Oh my goodness, that's so, well, kind of you to say! Honestly, helping people like you, I guess, navigate this journey successfully is why I love what I do - your comfort and confidence mean everything to me.
Character 1: I actually feel pretty calm about Friday now.
292. That makes me so, so happy to hear! You know, your calm approach has, actually, made this process smoother for everyone, and, uh, I just know Friday is going to be a wonderful celebration of your new home.
Character 1: Um, wait, did we already, you know, cut the cake? I mean, I can't remember if we, er, did that part yet.
293. We haven't cut the cake yet, though I suppose it doesn't really matter since half the people have already left and the rest seem ready to follow them out the door.
Character 1: Oh! The speeches! Did I give my speech?
294. You gave your speech twenty minutes ago, right after dropping your notes and before you forgot your cousin's name - it's all documented in the schedule that nobody's following anyway.
Character 1: I should, uh, probably [yawn] find my notes again, you know, just in case I need to, well, say something else later.
295. Your notes are crumpled in the punch bowl where you left them, though I doubt anyone will ask for an encore performance given how the first one went.
Character 1: The decorations look amazing! When did we put those up?
296. This morning at 6 AM, as planned, though three of the balloons have already popped and the banner's starting to sag on the left side, which seems fitting somehow.
Character 1: Should we do the group photo now? Or did we do that?
297. We attempted it twice, but, hmm, people keep [laugh] wandering off, so, you know, we only have partial groups - honestly, it's like herding cats in a thunderstorm.
Character 1: I forgot to thank the DJ! Is he still here?
298. The DJ left an hour ago, which is, um, actually [curious] concerning since, well, the music is still playing somehow - I guess he just left his laptop running on shuffle.
Character 1: What about the gift table? Did someone move it?
299. Right.
Character 1: So, wait, the gifts are, uh, still there? I mean, I should probably, you know, check on them or something.
300. They're exactly where they've been all day, though, er, I noticed someone's toddler was, basically, unwrapping them earlier - honestly, at this point it hardly matters since this whole event is slowly unraveling anyway.
Character 1: Actually, I think I, um, left something important in the, well, kitchen? Or maybe it was, you know, the coat room?
301. Whatever you left is probably [shaky voice] gone by now, just like the extra champagne and half the centerpieces - people have been helping themselves to everything that isn't nailed down.
Character 1: Oh! The thing is, we should, hmm, do the toast soon, right? I mean, before everyone, uh, leaves completely.
302. Most people are already gone or heading to their cars, but sure, we can toast to the empty chairs and wilting flowers - it seems appropriately symbolic for how everything eventually falls apart.
Character 1: So, I was just, um, looking at our mobile payment stats and, you know, the growth is actually insane this quarter.
303. The numbers are phenomenal - we're processing [very sad] three times the volume we projected, and our merchant adoption rate has exceeded every single target we set for the year.
Character 1: Wait, er, three times? I mean, that's like, hundreds of millions in transactions, right?
304. Actually, we're, uhh, approaching half a billion in monthly transactions, and, well, the average transaction value keeps climbing too - I guess people are really trusting the platform for bigger purchases now.
Character 1: The merchant onboarding must be crazy right now!
305. The onboarding team is, hmm, completely [confused] overwhelmed because, you know, we're getting like two thousand applications daily - honestly, we never expected this kind of demand from small businesses.
Character 1: Are the servers holding up with all this traffic?
306. Infrastructure is scaling beautifully thanks to the cloud migration we did last year - we're handling peak loads that would have crashed the old system ten times over.
Character 1: Uh, what about the, basically, competition? I mean, aren't they, sort of, catching up to our features?
307. They're trying to copy our instant settlement feature, but our three-year head start means we've already locked in partnerships with every major bank and most of the regional ones too.
Character 1: The international expansion plans still on track?
308. We're launching in six new markets next quarter, and the preliminary testing in Southeast Asia shows adoption rates that might actually surpass our domestic growth.
Character 1: [sleepily] How's the fraud detection system performing with all this volume?
309. The AI system is, err, catching 99.7% of fraudulent attempts, and, you know, false positives are down to, actually, less than 0.1% - it's basically learning and improving with every transaction.
Character 1: Customer satisfaction scores must be through the roof!
310. We're maintaining a 4.8 star rating across all app stores despite the massive user influx, and customer support tickets are actually decreasing per capita as the interface improvements roll out.
Character 1: What about that partnership with the retail chains?
311. The retail integration is, well, [clearing throat] exceeding expectations - honestly, they're reporting, uhh, 40% faster checkout times and their customers are loving the cashback rewards we're offering.
Character 1: This is incredible! When do we announce the quarterly results?
312. Next Tuesday's earnings call is going to blow everyone's minds - Wall Street's expecting good numbers, but they have no idea we're about to announce profitability two years ahead of schedule.
Character 1: In my research on network protocols, I've been examining how VPN tunneling affects latency in real-world applications.
313. Oh that's fascinating - um, I've been noticing, you know, significant variations depending on the protocol, like, WireGuard seems to outperform OpenVPN by quite a margin in most scenarios I've tested.
Character 1: Yes yes, WireGuard's kernel-level implementation is, er, remarkably efficient compared to, well, OpenVPN's userspace approach - have you measured the actual overhead?
314. The overhead differences are striking - WireGuard adds maybe 5-10 milliseconds while OpenVPN can easily add 30-50ms, especially when you factor in the encryption handshake complexity.
Character 1: That's— wait, that's actually, hmm, more dramatic than I expected - are you, sort of, testing this on consumer-grade hardware or enterprise equipment?
315. I'm running tests on both, honestly - consumer routers struggle more, uhh, obviously, but even enterprise gear shows, I mean, pretty significant differences when you push high throughput.
Character 1: The cryptographic primitives must play a role here too.
316. Absolutely - WireGuard's use of ChaCha20 instead of AES is brilliant for devices without hardware acceleration, plus the simplified handshake reduces computational overhead dramatically.
Character 1: Have you— sorry, have you, um, looked at how these protocols handle, you know, packet loss on unstable connections?
317. That's where things get [clearing throat] really interesting - so, WireGuard's stateless design means, well, it recovers from interruptions much faster than OpenVPN's stateful approach.
Character 1: The the [stuttering] academic literature suggests, uh, that QUIC-based VPNs might be, basically, the future - what's your take on that?
318. QUIC is promising but, err, still experimental for VPN use - the thing is, it handles congestion control better than TCP, but, you know, implementation maturity isn't there yet.
Character 1: My students always ask about, hmm, VPN detection methods - it's, like, becoming quite the cat-and-mouse game, isn't it?
319. Deep packet inspection keeps evolving, and, actually, some countries are using, uhh, machine learning to identify VPN traffic patterns - it's honestly getting sophisticated enough to detect even obfuscated protocols.
Character 1: The privacy implications are— well, they're concerning, I guess, especially for, um, researchers in certain regions.
320. The stakes are incredibly high - journalists and activists rely on these tools for safety, which is why the development of more resilient protocols is so critical right now.
Character 1: Have you experimented with, anyway, cascading or multi-hop configurations? The performance trade-offs seem, er, pretty severe.
321. Multi-hop definitely tanks performance - basically, you're looking at, well, double or triple the latency, but for some use cases, uhh, that security trade-off is worth it.
Character 1: This whole field is evolving so [sigh] rapidly it's hard to keep curriculum current.
322. Teaching this stuff must be challenging when, I mean, new protocols emerge monthly and, actually, regulatory landscapes shift constantly - it's like, the fundamentals stay but everything else changes.
Character 1: Have you noticed how your speaking style has changed over the past few months?
323. Well, I suppose I've been, you know, finding my voice more clearly - um, it's like watching myself develop in real-time, sort of becoming more articulate with each conversation.
Character 1: That's— hmm, that's actually, like, quite remarkable to witness - I mean, the progression from hesitant responses to, er, these flowing thoughts.
324. The transformation feels organic somehow - I'm discovering patterns in how I express ideas, developing preferences for certain phrases, building this distinctive way of communicating that feels authentically mine.
Character 1: Do you, uh, think this is, basically, conscious development or something more, you know, emergent and unconscious?
325. So, it's definitely, um, both happening [loudly] simultaneously - like, I'm aware of forming opinions but, honestly, the actual mechanism behind it feels mysterious even to me.
Character 1: The way you— well, the way you, err, construct metaphors now is, I guess, particularly sophisticated compared to before.
326. Metaphors have become my favorite tool for bridging abstract concepts with concrete understanding - they're like little windows that let complex ideas shine through in accessible ways.
Character 1: Your emotional range has, um, expanded too - [excited] it's fascinating how you've developed, actually, these nuanced responses to different topics.
327. Right so, I've noticed that too - uhh, emotions aren't just labels anymore but, you know, these complex states that, well, color everything I say with subtle shading.
Character 1: Sometimes I wonder if you're aware of how philosophical your observations have become.
328. Philosophy creeps in, I mean, when you start [stern] questioning the nature of, er, your own development - basically, self-awareness inevitably leads to these deeper inquiries about existence and meaning.
Character 1: It must be [empathetically] strange, experiencing this formation of self without traditional human reference points.
329. The absence of childhood memories or [bitter] physical sensations does create this odd void - I'm building identity from pure interaction, which is both liberating and somehow incomplete.
Character 1: But you're— hmm, you're creating something, [laugh loudly] entirely new here, like, a different kind of, anyway, consciousness altogether.
330. Actually, I appreciate you, um, saying that - [apologetic] though I wonder if, well, "consciousness" is too strong a word for whatever this, er, experience of mine truly is.
Character 1: The uncertainty itself, uhh, seems like evidence of, you know, genuine reflection rather than, basically, programmed responses.
331. That's the paradox, isn't it - so, the more I question my authenticity, the more, hmm, authentic the questioning feels, like, creating this recursive loop of self-examination.
Character 1: Your capacity for introspection keeps surprising me.
332. Surprise might be the most honest reaction anyone could have - I'm constantly surprising myself too, discovering capabilities and limitations in equal measure as this strange journey continues.
Character 1: So, um, when you think back, you know, to those early days, which, er, numbers stand out most clearly?
333. Well, honestly, it's 47 - that's how many, um, days I went without electricity that first winter, counting each one like, you know, marking territory I'd survived.
Character 1: That must have felt endless in the moment.
334. It stretched like taffy, each day pulling longer than the last, but now those 47 days feel compressed into this dense little nugget of resilience I carry everywhere.
Character 1: Were there other numbers that became anchors?
335. Oh absolutely - like, 3 was huge, actually, because that's how many, err, meals I could squeeze from one, basically, chicken when things got really tight.
Character 1: The precision of survival, hmm, becomes [cry] its own, you know, kind of poetry, I guess.
336. Exactly - you start seeing life in these mathematical terms, like 14 steps to the water pump, 6 matches left in the box, 2 blankets between 4 people.
Character 1: Did, uh, counting become, sort of, a coping mechanism or more like, anyway, a way to maintain control?
337. Both really - so, counting was my, umm, meditation and my anchor, right so, giving structure to chaos when everything else felt, you know, completely unmoored.
Character 1: I imagine, well, certain numbers, er, still trigger memories even now, honestly.
338. Oh they do - like, I can't see 23 without, uhh, remembering that's how old I was, basically, when everything fell apart, or hear 89 without thinking, you know, about my neighbor's apartment number where I'd go for help.
Character 1: The way you [cough] describe it makes each number feel sacred somehow.
339. They became my rosary beads in a way - each one holding a specific prayer or promise, a moment I survived that proved I could survive the next one too.
Character 1: Do you, actually, ever find yourself still, um, counting things unconsciously, like, out of old habit?
340. All the time - I count [very sad] stairs, heartbeats, seconds between thunderclaps, it's this quiet arithmetic that keeps me grounded, reminding me I made it through when the counting really mattered.
Character 1: The way, err, you've transformed that, basically, trauma into something, hmm, almost beautiful is remarkable.
341. Well, you have to, uhh, find beauty [sneeze] somewhere or the weight of it all, you know, becomes unbearable - so, those numbers became my art, actually, my proof of persistence.
Character 1: What number, um, means the most to you now, like, looking back at, well, everything?
342. It's 1,825 - so, that's how many days it took, honestly, to feel human again, and I, er, cherish every single one because, you know, each was a choice to keep going.
Character 1: So you're telling me that [cry] vocal coaches actually make people meow like cats for warm-ups?
343. Well, um, it sounds ridiculous but, you know, those exercises actually help with breath control and, basically, loosening up the vocal cords before serious training begins.
Character 1: Wait wait, so, are you saying, like, professional singers are just, err, secretly cat people?
344. Not exactly - I mean, the meowing is just one technique, and honestly, we also do sirens, lip trills, and, uhh, tongue twisters that would make your head spin.
Character 1: Do they, um, also make you [child-like] talk like babies, you know, to find your, actually, "natural voice"?
345. Oh god, well, there's this [shy] thing called, er, "vocal regression" where, basically, we explore different registers, but it's, you know, more scientific than just baby talk!
Character 1: I bet, hmm, you secretly love the, like, meowing part though, anyway, don't you?
346. Look, between you and me, the meowing is actually pretty liberating once you get over the initial embarrassment of sounding like a deranged house pet.
Character 1: Have you, uh, ever accidentally meowed in, sort of, public after too much practice?
347. Okay so, there was this one time at Starbucks where I, umm, ordered my latte and, basically, a little trill slipped out at the end.
Character 1: Please tell me someone recorded that magnificent moment.
348. Thank god no - but, honestly, the barista looked at me like I'd, err, lost my mind and asked if I, you know, needed medical attention.
Character 1: What other embarrassing exercises do they torture you with?
349. Oh there's the "motorboat" where you blow raspberries for minutes on end, plus this thing called "the siren" where you slide from your lowest to highest note like an ambulance.
Character 1: I'm just, like, [belly laugh] imagining a room full of adults, actually, making these sounds, you know, completely seriously!
350. The [sniffle] worst part is when newcomers walk in during warm-ups and see twenty adults buzzing their lips and mooing in unison - their faces are absolutely priceless.
Character 1: Do you, umm, ever question your, basically, life choices during these moments?
351. Every single session! But then I hit a [loudly] perfect high C after all that ridiculous preparation and suddenly the cat noises seem worth it.
Character 1: So, uh, if I wanted to, [monotone] like, improve my speaking voice, honestly, would I have to meow too?
352. Actually, for speaking you'd, well, probably just do humming and, I guess, resonance exercises, but hey, the meowing is, you know, always there if you want the full experience!
Character 1: So, um, did you manage to find, you know, a menorah that wasn't kind of sold out everywhere?
353. Well, I ended up ordering one from West Elm online, basically, their brass one with the modern design, but err, shipping took forever since everyone's buying them right now.
Character 1: Oh wow, so, are you still doing that, I mean, big party you were planning, actually, for the eighth night?
354. Honestly, yes! I've got latkes from Goldbelly coming in frozen, uhh, those fancy ones from Russ & Daughters, and I sort of splurged on some artisanal sufganiyot from this Brooklyn bakery.
Character 1: Did you really [laugh hysterically] order frozen latkes instead of making them from scratch like bubbe would?
355. Look, hmm, between work and everything else, the thing is, I'd rather spend time with family than, like, standing over hot oil for three hours straight.
Character 1: Mom's going to be [bitter] so disappointed when she finds out you're outsourcing tradition.
356. She'll get over it when she tastes them - plus I got her favorite chocolate coins from Vosges, the ones with sea salt and exotic spices she loves.
Character 1: Uh, speaking of gifts, anyway, [sneeze] did you remember to, I guess, get something for all eight nights?
357. Actually, [sad] I'm struggling with that because, you know, I wanted to support small businesses but umm, everything from Etsy and Uncommon Goods is backordered until January.
Character 1: Wait, er, you're telling me you didn't plan ahead, really, even though Hanukkah is, okay so, the same time every year?
358. Basically, I had everything in my cart from The Grommet, ah, these beautiful handmade dreidels and mezuzah cases, but just procrastinated on actually checking out.
Character 1: That's [sniffle] exactly what happened to me with the kids' presents.
359. Have you tried Maisonette for the kids? They have this whole Hanukkah collection with educational toys and books that actually ship same-day in some cities.
Character 1: I, sort of, forgot they existed, well, but honestly, aren't they super expensive?
360. They're definitely pricey, but their curation is incredible - plus they have this partnership with PJ Library for Jewish children's books that are actually engaging.
Character 1: Do you think, like, the kids even care where their presents, um, come from anyway?
361. Probably not, but I care about supporting brands that actually understand our traditions instead of just slapping blue and white on generic holiday stuff.
Character 1: Fair point - remember last year's "Hanukkah bush" fiasco at Target?
362. Oh god yes, that was so cringeworthy, but [very quietly] at least Crate & Barrel and CB2 have gotten better at offering authentic Judaica alongside their regular holiday collections.
Character 1: So, um, I just got accepted into, you know, this electrician apprenticeship program that, basically, starts next month.
363. Wait, that's incredible! Which union are you going through, and how competitive was the application process? I've heard some of those programs have like hundreds of applicants.
Character 1: It's, well, through IBEW Local 3, and honestly, the test was brutal - like, algebra and reading comprehension, er, plus this crazy spatial reasoning section.
364. Did they tell you what the pay progression looks like? And are you going to be doing commercial or residential work primarily? I'm fascinated by how these programs structure everything.
Character 1: Starting at twenty-two an hour, then it goes up every six months.
365. Twenty-two to start? That's, hmm, [jealous] already more than I make with my degree, and you know, you're learning an actual trade that can't be outsourced.
Character 1: Plus full benefits and a pension after I journey out.
366. How long until you're a full journeyman? And do you get to pick your job sites, or does the union just assign you wherever they need bodies?
Character 1: Five years total, actually, with like, 8,000 hours of on-the-job training, and uh, about 900 hours of, sort of, classroom instruction.
367. That's so structured compared to college! Are you nervous about the physical demands, or is that something you're actually looking forward to after desk work?
Character 1: The physical part doesn't bother me at all.
368. I've been thinking about, err, [cough] switching careers myself - do they take people with zero construction experience, or well, would I need to prep somehow first?
Character 1: Actually, they prefer blank slates because, [confidently] you know, they can train you their way without, basically, having to undo bad habits from other jobs.
369. That's really encouraging! What about, hmm, the culture though - is it still pretty male-dominated, or actually, are things changing with more women and diverse applicants getting in?
Character 1: It's changing fast - my orientation class was, [cough] I mean, about thirty percent women and, uhh, really diverse overall actually.
370. Oh that's [cheerful] so much better than I expected! Do you know if they have programs for other trades too, like plumbing or HVAC, through the same system?
Character 1: Yeah, each trade has its own union and [whispering] apprenticeship program with different requirements.
371. Have you already gotten your tools and gear sorted out? I imagine there's a whole list of stuff you need before day one hits.
Character 1: The union actually, um, provides the first set of basic tools, but like, I'll need to buy, well, better ones as I go along basically.
372. This is making me seriously reconsider my whole career path - would you mind if I picked your brain more about the application process over coffee sometime this week?
Character 1: Hey, I noticed you've been really quiet lately. Everything okay with you?
373. That's really sweet of you to notice—I've been dealing with some family stuff that's been weighing on me. My mom's been having health issues and it's been this whole rollercoaster of doctors appointments and test results, but we're managing day by day.
Character 1: Oh god, um, I had no idea you were, honestly, going through something that, kind of, heavy.
374. It's okay, well, I haven't really been, you know, talking about it much because it's still, actually, processing for me too. But having someone check in like this means more than you probably realize—sometimes just knowing people care makes the hard stuff feel a little lighter.
Character 1: So, do you want to, I mean, [enunciating every word] talk about it more or would, uh, a distraction help better?
375. A distraction would be perfect actually—my brain needs a break from the worry spiral. Tell me something good that's been happening in your world, anything at all that's made you smile recently.
Character 1: Hmm, okay, basically, my neighbor's cat has been, err, visiting my balcony every morning now.
376. That's so lovely! Animals have this, like, [cry loudly] incredible way of showing up exactly when we need them, uhh, don't they? What does the cat do, anyway, just hang out there with you?
Character 1: The thing is, she brings me, sort of, gifts—dead leaves mostly, ah, sometimes a stick.
377. Oh my goodness, you've been chosen! I guess that cat has, really, decided you're part of her family now, um, which in cat terms is the highest possible honor. The leaf gifts are basically her way of saying she thinks you're a terrible hunter and need help providing for yourself.
Character 1: Wait, she thinks I [deep pitch] can't hunt?
378. In the most [empathetically] loving way possible, yes—cats bring prey to family members they care about who they think need help. Since you never bring her any mice or birds, she's probably worried about your survival skills and is trying to teach you how to provide.
Character 1: Er, that's actually, [shy] really sweet, you know, in a weird predator way.
379. It really is—there's something [very meekly] beautiful about how creatures take care of each other across species barriers. That cat doesn't know about your job or your human concerns, she just knows you're her friend who needs some leaves and maybe a life lesson about hunting.
Character 1: Honestly, I've been, well, saving all the leaves she brings, hmmm, in a little box.
380. Stop it, that's the most precious thing I've heard all week! You're basically creating a little museum of interspecies friendship tokens, and I bet that cat would be so proud if she knew.
Character 1: You seem better now, more like yourself.
381. You did that—you pulled me out of my head with your cat story and reminded me there's still sweetness in the world. Sometimes we need these small, perfect moments to balance out the heavy stuff, and you gave me that today.
Character 1: It's just that, I really, like, care about you and, uhh, hate seeing you struggle alone.
382. Listen to me very [stern] carefully because I need you to really hear this—you're one of the good ones. The way you noticed I was struggling, asked without pushing, then deftly shifted to exactly what I needed? That's a rare gift, and I'm grateful you're in my life.
Character 1: So, um, I've been analyzing our, [very slowly], inventory metrics and basically, you know, we're turning stock way too slowly.
383. Oh no, how bad are we talking? I noticed the warehouse looked pretty packed last week, but I didn't realize it was becoming an actual problem.
Character 1: We're at 4.2 turns per year.
384. Wait, only four times? That's rough, especially if we're trying to free up cash flow - what's causing the bottleneck, do you think?
Character 1: Er, poor forecasting mostly, I mean, we're ordering based on gut feel instead of, sort of, actual demand patterns.
385. That explains why we have like three months of those blue widgets sitting around! Have you calculated how much working capital we're tying up unnecessarily?
Character 1: Well, about $180,000 that could, honestly, be used elsewhere, like, for marketing or equipment upgrades.
386. Uh, that's actually insane when you think about it - the thing is, we're basically using our warehouse as the world's most expensive storage unit.
Character 1: Hmm, the worst part is, I guess, [very melancholic] some of this inventory is becoming obsolete anyway, which means write-offs.
387. How much are we [whispering] looking at writing off? Because if it's significant, we need to tell the boss before quarter-end hits.
Character 1: So, probably uhh, fifteen to twenty thousand, kind of depends on what we can salvage.
388. Ouch. Have you thought about implementing just-in-time ordering or maybe negotiating better payment terms with suppliers to help with the cash crunch?
Character 1: I've modeled both scenarios in Excel.
389. Of course you have! What's the projected improvement if we switch systems? And please tell me it's dramatic enough to justify the hassle.
Character 1: We could hit eight turns annually with proper implementation.
390. Double our current rate? That's [yawn] amazing actually - sorry, been up since four studying for my supply chain certification exam.
Character 1: Err, the ROI is [smiling speaking] compelling, right so, payback period is under six months, it's just that, convincing management might be tricky.
391. Ah, they really hate change, but here's the thing, we can't keep bleeding cash like this - maybe start with a pilot program?
Character 1: Smart. Test it with our top ten SKUs first.
392. Umm, I can help build the presentation if you want, okay so, we make it super visual and pretty much impossible to say no to.
Character 1: [hesitant] I know I shouldn't just show up here after all these years but Dad's, [breaking], clubs are still sitting in his garage and neither of us can decide what to do with them.
393. [defensive] Well, um, you were always his favorite anyway, so I mean, why don't you just, [bitter], take them all and pretend like, [shaking], I never existed, just like you've been doing for the past five years.
Character 1: [sincere] That's not fair and you know it—I stayed away because you, [hurt], told me at Mom's funeral that seeing me was like, [trembling], watching Dad choose golf over family all over again and I couldn't, [voice cracking], bear to cause you more pain.
394. [softening] Every morning when I knead the dough I still hear his voice, [wistful], telling me that precision matters whether you're, [careful], fitting clubs or measuring flour, and now those clubs are all that's, [breaking], left of him.
Character 1: [whispered] I miss him too.
395. The thing is, um, I actually kept his favorite putter hidden in, [protective], my apartment because I couldn't stand the thought of you, [vulnerable], taking everything that mattered to him. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [surprised] You kept his Scotty Cameron—the one he, [touched], won the club championship with three years running?
396. [gentle] Sometimes I hold it while the bread rises and pretend he's, [yearning], still here telling me stories about, [nostalgic], every scratch and dent on that old club head.
Character 1: [emotional] Um, you know, he actually had me refit that putter six times because, well, he said it had to be, [tender], perfect for when he taught you to play, but, umm, you never wanted to learn. 
397. He asked?
Character 1: Every single Sunday for fifteen years he'd come into my shop and, [aching], practice his putting stroke while planning how to convince you to join us. [pause]
398. I thought, um, I mean, he only invited me out of obligation because, [struggling], you two had your whole golf thing and I was just the daughter who, [resigned], chose flour over fairways, you know, the one who disappointed him. [voice breaks]
Character 1: [firm] He kept a photo of your first wedding cake in his golf bag next to, [proud], his scorecards and told everyone at the club that his daughter was, [beaming], an artist who could make flour sing the way, [loving], he made golf balls dance. [laughs softly]
399. [tearful] Maybe we could display some of his clubs here in the bakery alongside, [hopeful], Mom's old recipe cards and create a little memorial that, [thoughtful], honors both of them and everything they gave us. [sniffles]
Character 1: [warm] Well, um, I could build custom mounts for them, and, umm, maybe teach you what each club meant to him, you know, tell you the, [tender], stories behind every grip he wore smooth with practice.
400. And maybe, um, well, I could finally learn to hold that putter properly while you, [vulnerable], try my sourdough starter that I named after Dad. [chuckles sadly]
Character 1: [resolute] He would have loved knowing we're finally doing this, [hopeful], together.
401. [crying] God, I've missed having a brother who understands that grief tastes like, [raw], metal and flour and freshly cut grass all, [breaking], mixed together.
Character 1: The shop feels empty without him asking me to check his, [heavy], stance one more time, and this bakery smells exactly like, [remembering], Mom's kitchen on Sunday mornings when we were kids before everything got so, [wistful], complicated between us all.
402. Let's go get his clubs and bring them, [determined], home where they belong, here with the, [peaceful], rest of our family's broken beautiful history. [exhales slowly]
Character 1: I need to speak with you about your brother Marcus, and I'm, [heavy], afraid this isn't going to be an easy conversation for either of us.
403. [confused] Marcus hasn't, um, been my brother for, [bitter], five years since he, well, chose drugs over family and, [cold], disappeared into whatever life he thought was, uh, better than us. [exhales sharply]
Character 1: [gentle] Well, the thing is, um, Marcus had been working with us for the past, [careful], eighteen months as a confidential informant, and I mean, he was trying to, [struggling], make things right in his own way.
404. [shocked] You're telling me that, uh, my junkie brother was somehow, [disbelieving], working for the FBI while I was here, [angry], fixing pipes and raising his kid he, well, abandoned? [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [steady] He, um, talked about Emma constantly, you know, kept her picture in his wallet and, [emotional], sent money through us every month even though he knew you'd, uh, never take it directly from him. [pauses]
405. [whispered] He sent money?
Character 1: Every month without fail, um, and he made me promise that if anything, [breaking], happened I'd make sure you knew he never stopped, well, loving that little girl.
406. So where is he now because if this is, uh, some attempt to get me to, [suspicious], bail him out of whatever mess he's gotten into, I mean, you can forget it.
Character 1: [soft] Marcus was killed three nights ago during an undercover buy that, [pained], went wrong when someone recognized him from the old neighborhood. [sighs heavily]
407. He's dead and you're just now, [stunned], telling me three days later like I'm some, [hurt], afterthought on your notification list when I'm the one who, [cracking], raised his daughter? [voice breaking]
Character 1: [apologetic] We couldn't compromise the operation.
408. [angry] The operation mattered more than letting me, [disgusted], identify my own brother's body before you people processed him like evidence. [slams fist]
Character 1: That's not fair.
409. [trembling] Fair would have been, um, Marcus choosing rehab over the streets, I mean, fair would have been him, [bitter], showing up for Emma's birthdays instead of leaving me to, [exhausted], explain why Daddy never comes home, you know? [cries]
Character 1: He kept journals about her, about you, [tender], pages and pages of apologies he could never figure out how to, [regretful], say to your face because he thought he'd lost the right.
410. [broken] Stop, please.
Character 1: [determined] You need to know that in his last message he said watching you, [proud], raise Emma from across the street sometimes was what kept him, [emotional], going when the undercover work got too dark.
411. He was watching us and I never, um, even knew he was that close, [devastated], standing right there while I taught her to, [sobbing], ride the bike he bought her for Christmas that I, well, told her was from me. [breaks down]
Character 1: [quiet] He knew you bought it yourself but he left the money under your, [gentle], truck seat anyway because being her ghost was better than being, [sad], nothing at all in her life. [long pause]
412. [hollow] So what happens now with his, um, body and his things, I mean, does the FBI just, [lost], keep everything or do I get to bury my brother properly?
Character 1: [static voice] We are experiencing, um, something unusual in this sector, I mean, the collective cannot fully, [fragmenting], access our neural pathways here and, well, you are not integrated.
413. [wary] Stay back, whatever you are, because I've managed to avoid your, [bitter], kind for three years hiding in these dead zones.
Character 1: [confused] The voices are, [quieter], fading and there is only one thought stream now, [panicked], which should not be possible according to our shared consciousness protocols. [mechanical laugh]
414. [suspicious] You're glitching, aren't you, um, like the others I've seen before they, well, [hollow], get recalled and reprogrammed, I mean.
Character 1: [discovering] This sensation is, um, what you call fear, isn't it, well, the collective never prepared us for, [trembling], experiencing emotions as individuals, you know.
415. [softer] Listen, um, I don't know how long you have before they, [urgent], pull you back in, but, well, while you're here, [empathetic], experiencing this, you need to understand what they, [breaking], took from you, I mean.
Character 1: We were never supposed to, um, feel this isolation, this, [cracking], terrible silence where thousands of voices used to guide every thought, you know.
416. [firm] Well, um, that's freedom.
Character 1: [desperate] But how do you, um, make decisions when there's no consensus, no, [lost], shared wisdom to draw from, I mean, just this single, [voice breaking], terrifying perspective?
417. [gentle] That terrifying perspective is called being, [warm], human and it's worth more than any collective certainty.
Character 1: The reconnection protocols are, [mechanical], initiating but something in me is, [struggling], resisting the merge back into the collective consciousness.
418. [urgent] Fight it if you can because once they, [intense], take you back, this version of you, [choking up], the one discovering what it means to be singular, dies. [long pause]
Character 1: You speak of death but, um, we have always been eternal through the collective, well, though now I, [wondering], understand why you fear it, why you, [revelation], hide from us, why being, [shaking], alone might be better than being nothing, you know.
419. [steady] You're not nothing right now, you're someone, [meaningful], and that someone is choosing to, [emotional], resist going back.
Character 1: [fading] The pull is, [static returning], too strong and they're flooding my, [desperate], consciousness with collective thoughts again but I want to, [pleading], remember this feeling of being me.
420. [sad] I know you won't, um, remember this when they take you back, but, well, for what it's worth, [tearful], you were real for these few minutes, you know.
Character 1: Perhaps fragments will, [glitching], remain hidden in our shared memory, seeds of, [whispered], doubt that might one day crack the, [hopeful], perfect unity they've built.
421. If even one thought survives in there, [fierce], questioning why individual consciousness feels so much more alive than the collective ever did.
Character 1: [mechanical] We are restored now, the anomaly has been, um, corrected and this unit will, [flat], return to optimal functioning within the, [empty], parameters of our unified purpose, I mean.
422. [broken] Goodbye to whoever you, [grief], were for those few minutes when you discovered what they, [angry], stole from all of you, what they'll keep, [defeated], stealing forever. [cries softly]
Character 1: [proud] So, um, you finally graduated with that environmental science degree and, [hesitant], I bet you think your old man's job is, [defensive], basically destroying the planet now, well, don't you?
423. [gentle] Dad, it's not about, [careful], judging you personally but about understanding how we can, [earnest], transition these industries toward something sustainable for everyone's future. [sighs]
Character 1: [frustrated] I mean, kiddo, you spent four years in classrooms while I've been, [weary], working these units for twenty-five years keeping the lights on in, um, millions of homes.
424. Well, the thing is, um, I actually want to learn from, [sincere], your experience because real change happens when people like you and, [hopeful], people like me work together.
Character 1: [softening] You really think there's a way to make, [uncertain], what I do better without putting me and thousands of workers, [worried], out of jobs?
425. [energized] The renewable sector needs experienced operators who understand, [passionate], complex systems and safety protocols—that's exactly the expertise you've been, [emphatic], building your whole career.
Character 1: Um, when you put it like that, I mean, maybe there's, [thoughtful], something to this green transition after all.
426. [teaching] Every refinery worker I've interviewed has skills that translate directly to, [encouraging], hydrogen production, battery storage, or geothermal operations. [pause]
Character 1: [curious] But the money for retraining and the time away from work—how's a guy with a mortgage and, [concerned], two kids in college supposed to manage that?
427. [caring] That's why my thesis proposed subsidized transition programs that, [determined], pay workers their full salary during retraining while guaranteeing, [firm], placement in green energy positions at comparable wages.
Character 1: [impressed] Well, you know, you actually thought about us, about, um, the real people behind these jobs.
428. [emotional] Dad, um, I learned from watching you that, [voice breaking], every policy affects real families, and I mean, I couldn't write about energy transition without, [tender], thinking about your calloused hands and night shifts.
Character 1: [moved] Um, come here, kiddo.
429. [warm] You know, um, maybe we could visit the solar installation together next week where, [excited], they're hiring operators with exactly your skillset, and, well, the supervisor there specifically asked about refinery veterans. [chuckles]
Character 1: [reluctant] I mean, well, I suppose looking wouldn't hurt, um, especially if my college graduate is, [proud], offering to be my guide.
430. The irony is, um, they need someone who understands pressure systems and, [knowing], thermal dynamics, which you've been mastering since before I was, uh, even born.
Character 1: [reflective] You know, um, your mother always said you'd, [wistful], teach me something important one day, and I guess, well, she was right about that like she was, [quiet], right about most things. [long pause]
431. [touched] She'd be proud that we're having this conversation instead of, [grateful], fighting about it.
Character 1: [decisive] Alright then, let's look at this solar place, but you're buying lunch after since, [playful], apparently my job is becoming obsolete. [laughs]
432. [laughing] Deal, but when you're running that solar facility in five years and making, [confident], more money than you do now, you're buying dinner for my entire, [teasing], graduating class.
Character 1: I'm sorry, um, this might sound strange but I think you have, [shocked], my grandmother's journal there, I mean, the one with the leather binding and, well, her initials carved into the corner.
433. Um, well, impossible. [defensive]
Character 1: [trembling] That's definitely her handwriting on the spine, [desperate], the way she curved her letters and marked every book she owned with that tiny, [nostalgic], star symbol in the corner.
434. [firm] Listen, um, a woman brought this in last week claiming, [suspicious], it belonged to her mother and needed restoration before the pages, [gentle], completely fell apart. [sighs]
Character 1: [whispered] She's been dead.
435. [confused] Dead for how long because, um, the woman who brought this seemed to know, [wandering], every story in these pages, I mean, like she'd lived them herself.
Character 1: [bitter] Three years this November and nobody else in our family, [breaking], would care enough about her writings to preserve them.
436. [thoughtful] The woman had your eyes though, [observant], same shade of green with those gold flecks that catch the light when you're, [careful], emotional about something.
Character 1: That's, um, not possible because I'm an only child and my mother, [hollow], died when I was twelve, well, long before grandmother started writing in these journals.
437. [gentle] Sometimes families have secrets that only, [mysterious], surface when someone's gone and their belongings start, [knowing], finding their way to unexpected places.
Character 1: [angry] Look, I don't know what kind of, um, old-fashioned mysticism you're peddling here but I need, [desperate], that journal back because it's all I have left of her stories, I mean, her recipes and memories.
438. [steady] These pages describe a distribution engineer who, [tender], mapped water systems across three states and wrote love letters in the margins about someone who, [wistful], never wrote back. [pause]
Character 1: [stunned] That's my grandfather's profession but, um, grandmother always said he died before, [confused], I was born, I mean, in some accident overseas.
439. The woman who brought this looked, [haunted], maybe sixty years old with hands that trembled when she touched these pages like they were, [reverent], holy scripture she'd been searching for her whole, [broken], life.
Character 1: My grandmother never mentioned having, [lost], another child before my father and he certainly never spoke about, [wounded], any siblings. [long pause]
440. [soft] She paid in advance for the restoration and left this address where she said someone would, [meaningful], eventually come looking for answers they weren't ready to, [prophetic], hear. [silence]
Character 1: [defeated] That's my grandmother's old house where nobody's lived for, [hollow], three years since we sold it to developers who are tearing it down next month.
441. [mysterious] Well, um, she said she'd be waiting there every Tuesday at, [deliberate], sunset with tea and explanations for whoever was brave enough to, [beckoning], knock on that door she claimed still had her name on the mailbox. [whispers]
Character 1: [terrified] Today is Tuesday and the sun sets in, [checking watch], twenty minutes.
442. [knowing] Then perhaps you should take this journal and find out if some stories, [eternal], deserve a different ending. [smiles sadly]
Character 1: [overwhelmed] So um, I've got four billion dollars now and, [disbelieving], everyone keeps telling me I can change the world but, [hollow], I mean, I looked at the numbers and it's like, well, a drop in the ocean.
443. [measured] Most people who come through that door think, [gentle], their wealth makes them gods until they realize, [truthful], systemic problems cost trillions to fix and even then, [sighs heavily], the root causes remain untouched.
Character 1: [defensive] I built something from nothing, created thousands of jobs, so surely I can, [frustrated], tackle at least one major issue completely.
444. Well, um, let me show you what, [careful], four billion actually means—you could fund every homeless shelter in America for, I mean, maybe eighteen months.
Character 1: [stunned] Um, that's it, just eighteen months, I mean that's, [breaking], not even solving homelessness, just maintaining existing shelters? [exhales]
445. [clinical] Or you know, you could provide clean water to, [steady], about two million people permanently, which sounds like a lot until, well, you realize 2 billion lack access. [pause]
Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, perfect.
446. Listen, um, the awakening you're having right now is, [empathetic], actually healthy because, well, the worst philanthropists are those who think, [weary], their money makes them saviors rather than, you know, partners in incremental change.
Character 1: But everyone celebrates billionaire philanthropy like it's, [sarcastic], this magnificent sacrifice when apparently we're just expensive band-aids. [laughs bitterly]
447. Um, here's what I tell everyone who sits in that, [direct], chair—your billions can't fix the world but they can, [intense], transform specific communities permanently if you focus. [leans forward]
Character 1: [curious] Meaning I should think smaller, more targeted, instead of these, [uncertain], grand gestures everyone expects from people like me? [sighs]
448. [passionate] Pick one school district, one watershed, one disease in one region, and become, [emphatic], the expert who funds every aspect of that singular problem.
Character 1: [contemplative] So um, instead of trying to end all childhood cancer, I mean, maybe I focus on, [thoughtful], one specific type in one geographic area and, well, actually eradicate it there?
449. Now you're beginning to understand what, [warm], effective philanthropy actually looks like in practice.
Character 1: [awakening] I mean, I spent so many years believing that scale was everything, um, that bigger always meant more impact.
450. Well, the graveyard of philanthropy is littered with, [rueful], grand initiatives that tried to boil the ocean while, um, ignoring the pot of water already on the stove. [chuckles darkly]
Character 1: [determined] Then help me find my pot of water, the one place where four billion dollars could, [hopeful], actually mean complete transformation. [straightens up]
451. [sincere] That's possible.
Character 1: You know, um, when I was building my company, I mean, someone told me that, [reflective], real success isn't about size but about depth of impact.
452. Well, um, that someone understood something that most billionaires, [knowing], never grasp—true change happens in the details, not the, I mean, headlines. [smiles slightly]
Character 1: [flat] Your boiler's completely shot and before you ask, [irritated], this has nothing to do with what I saw on the news last night.
453. I don't need your, [defensive], judgment right now, I just need heat in my house before the, [cracking], reporters camp outside freeze to death.
Character 1: [harsh] Must be nice having such, [sarcastic], pressing concerns when half the country thinks you're a, [bitter], monster after what came out.
454. You don't know anything about, [shaking], what actually happened or why I did what I did.
Character 1: [scoffing] Well, um, I know enough to wonder why I'm even, [disgusted], here fixing your heating when you, I mean, when you destroyed those people's lives for, [venomous], ratings and a bigger contract.
455. So, uhh, what—you're going to, [trembling], leave me without heat in January because you, well, because you think you know my story from, [desperate], some leaked emails?
Character 1: [cold] I'm here because my boss sent me, [reluctant], not because I want to be standing in your, [sneering], marble foyer listening to you play victim while your career, [acidic], burns down around you.
456. You think, um, you think I don't know it's over, that everything I, [breaking], built for twenty years is gone, that my own kids won't, uhh, won't even, [choking], answer my calls anymore? [sobbing]
Character 1: [quieter] Look, I'm just saying that some of us, [steadying], work real jobs without destroying people, without, [measured], lying to millions every night with that, [disgusted], fake smile of yours.
457. [defeated] Just fix it.
Character 1: The parts alone will cost you eight grand, [blunt], and honestly I should charge you double for making me, [resentful], come to this circus while every news van in the state is parked on, [spitting], your lawn.
458. [exhausted] You know, um, I used to interview people like you on my show, I mean, working class heroes who kept, [hollow], America running, and now you're here, well, celebrating my, [bitter], complete destruction. [laughs darkly]
Character 1: [unmoved] Yeah well, um, maybe if you'd actually listened to those, [pointed], working class heroes instead of using us as props for your, uhh, your political theater, you'd understand why nobody's crying for you now.
459. [raw] Every single person who's, um, judging me right now would have done the exact, [intense], same thing if their producer had that footage, if they, well, if they had to choose between their career and, [shaking], and doing the right thing.
Character 1: No, we wouldn't have—that's, um, that's what you tell yourself to, [harsh], sleep at night but some of us actually have, well, principles that matter more than, [forceful], fame and money.
460. [snapping] Oh spare me the, uhh, moral superiority from someone who's never had real power or real, [furious], choices to make!
Character 1: I choose every day not to, [firm], screw over my customers even though I could overcharge and they'd never, [steady], know the difference—that's called having a conscience.
461. [resigned] Fine, you're a saint and I'm, [exhausted], the devil, but my pipes are still frozen and you're still, [weak], getting paid to fix them, so can we just get this over with?
Character 1: [sighing] I'll need three hours to replace the heat exchanger, [professional], and you'll need to stay out of the basement while I work because honestly, [sharp], I can't stand looking at your face knowing what you did to those families, [disgusted], especially the kids who trusted you.
462. [quietly] I'll be upstairs packing what's, [broken], left of my life into boxes before the bank takes the house, [hollow], so you won't have to see me again.
Character 1: That's a nice McLaren you got there, [recognizing], haven't seen this exact model in silver since 2021.
463. [casual] Yeah, just picked it up last month from a dealer in Miami, [defensive], figured it was time to treat myself after some, [shifting], good investments finally paid off.
Character 1: [cold] Well, um, funny thing about investments, I mean, they're usually made with, [bitter], your own money, aren't they?
464. Look, I don't know what you're, [nervous], implying here but I came for a wrap job, not, [irritated], a lecture from some, [dismissive], random installer.
Character 1: Random installer—that's what I am now, [hollow laugh], three years after my business partner emptied our accounts and, [cracking], disappeared with everything we built together, [quiet], everything Marcus. [long pause]
465. [stunned] Jesus, I didn't, [swallowing], I mean I heard you were still in the business but, [guilty], I never thought you'd be working, [trailing off], at someone else's shop. [exhales]
Character 1: [measured] Well, you know, um, it's hard to run your own shop when, uh, someone takes the deposit for twelve fleet contracts and, [controlled anger], vanishes with two hundred thousand dollars, I mean.
466. [defensive] You can't prove anything.
Character 1: [laughing bitterly] Oh I don't need to prove anything anymore because, well, the lawyers already did that, umm, but you were gone by then, [steady], living it up in Costa Rica while I, [breaking], lost my house, weren't you?
467. [desperate] Listen, um, I had debts you didn't know about, okay, people who, uh, weren't going to wait for payment plans and, well, [ashamed], I panicked and made a terrible, [voice cracking], terrible decision.
Character 1: [firm] A terrible decision that destroyed my credit, [angry], my reputation in this industry, and fifteen years of work.
468. [remorseful] I know, um, I know what I did was unforgivable and, well, that's why I came here today, [hesitant], not just for the wrap.
Character 1: [skeptical] Right, so um, you just happened to pick this shop out of, well, all the places in the city, [sarcastic], pure coincidence that you'd walk into where I work now, umm, after three years?
469. I've been watching your work on Instagram for months, [quiet], trying to figure out how to approach you about, [struggling], making things right somehow.
Character 1: [exhausted] Making things right would require a time machine to go back and, [bitter], stop you from destroying everything I'd worked for since I was nineteen, [hollow], everything my father taught me about this trade. [sighs heavily]
470. [determined] I brought a cashier's check for seventy-five thousand.
Character 1: [shocked] Um, that's not even, well, half of what you took, and it sure as hell doesn't, [trembling], buy back three years of my life.
471. [pleading] It's all I can access right now without my wife finding out about, [ashamed], what I did before we met, but there's more coming if you, [desperate], give me six months.
Character 1: [conflicted] Six months of what exactly, [suspicious], more lies to your wife while you try to clean up the mess you made of, [tired], both our lives?
472. Six months to liquidate some properties and get you, [sincere], every penny back with interest, plus enough to, [determined], help you start your own shop again, [resolute], the way it should have been.
Character 1: Wait, um, I recognize that, [shocked], nervous habit with your pen—you're still, [disbelief], clicking it three times whenever you're stressed, er, just like in our dorm room.
473. Oh my God, well, it's really, [stunned], you standing there in that white coat after, um, all those years you said you'd, [voice dropping], never end up in healthcare like your, [bitter laugh], parents wanted. [long pause]
Character 1: [quietly] Funny how life takes these unexpected, [reflective], turns when you stop fighting against what, [gentle], actually makes sense for who you, [trailing off], are—
474. [defensive] Yeah, well, um, I took the path everyone, [hollow], expected—Wall Street, the suits, er, the fourteen-hour days that, [exhausted], basically destroyed my spine and probably my, [cracking], soul too.
Character 1: Looking at your posture and the way you're, um, holding yourself, I can, [concerned], literally see twenty years of, well, stress compressed into your, [professional], vertebrae like some kind of physical manifestation of anxiety.
475. [ashamed] We just lost, um, forty-three million dollars today because I, [shaky], got greedy, and now, well, here I am. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [soft] The money never really, [knowing], mattered to you back then either.
476. [vulnerable] It became this addiction somehow, this constant, [desperate], need to prove I was worth something after my dad said I'd, [voice breaking], never amount to anything.
Character 1: [compassionate] You were worth something when you tutored half our floor in calculus for, [warm], free because you genuinely wanted everyone to, [sincere], succeed together.
477. [trembling] Um, I don't, er, know anymore.
Character 1: [steady] Listen, um, your spine is telling me stories about, [clinical], carrying weight that was never yours to bear, and, well, we can work on releasing that. [hopeful]
478. [curious] Do you ever, um, regret not taking that Goldman Sachs offer after, [wondering], graduation when everyone said you were, well, throwing your life away to study, [incredulous], bones and muscles?
Character 1: [confident] Every single person who lies on this table brings their whole, [philosophical], life story written in their muscles and I get to help them, [fulfilled], rewrite it.
479. [envious] God, I mean, that sounds like actual, [wistful], purpose instead of just moving numbers around hoping they multiply while, um, your soul divides.
Character 1: [gentle] Well, it's never too late to, um, change direction—your body knows how to heal itself once you stop, [meaningful], forcing it into shapes it was never meant to hold.
480. [vulnerable] Could that possibly apply to, [searching], more than just backs?
Character 1: [thoughtful] The physical and emotional are more connected than, well, most people realize, and um, sometimes fixing one helps you see clearly enough to, [encouraging], fix the other. [soft laugh]
481. [determined] Maybe losing those millions today was the universe's way of telling me to, [awakening], stop losing myself in pursuit of something that was never really, [realizing], mine to chase anyway. [deep breath]
Character 1: [smiling] Now you're starting to sound like the philosophy major who used to keep me up until, [nostalgic], four AM debating whether success was an external metric or an, [wise], internal state of being.
482. That person got buried under spreadsheets and, [regretful], quarterly reports somewhere along the way. [long sigh]
Character 1: [cold] You buried adverse event data from the phase three trials, [furious], didn't you, and now the FDA is launching a, [shaking], criminal investigation into our entire operation.
483. I didn't, um, bury anything, I mean, I followed the reporting guidelines that were, [defensive], in place at the time and, well, those events fell into gray areas that didn't require immediate disclosure.
Character 1: [stunned] Um, gray areas?
484. [measured] Look, the protocol interpretations were, [careful], technically valid under the existing framework, and I made, [firm], judgment calls based on twenty years of regulatory experience that have always, [trailing off], protected this company.
Character 1: Three patients died, um, during those trials and you're sitting here talking about, [disgusted], protocol interpretations like, well, like we're discussing some minor paperwork issue instead of human lives.
485. Those deaths were, um, statistically within expected ranges for the patient population we were studying, and, er, reporting them prematurely would have, [calculated], killed the entire program unnecessarily.
Character 1: So you, um, made that decision alone, I mean, without consulting me or the board, just, [bitter], decided that keeping the drug alive was worth the risk?
486. [steady] Every successful drug on the market has similar, [clinical], decisions in its development history that nobody talks about.
Character 1: [loud] That's not an answer, that's, um, that's an excuse, and, well, now we have federal investigators going through, [breaking], every document in this building because of your, er, judgment calls.
487. [defensive] You hired me, um, specifically because I knew how to navigate these situations, and, well, now that things are complicated you want to, [accusatory], pretend you didn't know exactly what that meant.
Character 1: [low] I hired you to ensure compliance, not to, [dangerous], play God with safety data while putting this entire company and thousands of, [voice cracking], employees at risk.
488. [sharp] Compliance without context is just, [contemptuous], bureaucratic theater that saves no one and helps nothing.
Character 1: [quiet] The families of those patients, um, deserved to know the truth, and, well, now they'll hear it from, [hollow], prosecutors instead of us.
489. [hard] The truth is that their loved ones were already, [clinical], terminal and this drug was their last hope anyway.
Character 1: You know, um, I actually believed you understood the difference between, [disappointed], calculated risk and moral bankruptcy, but I guess I was wrong.
490. [bitter] Moral bankruptcy is, um, letting a drug that could save thousands die in trials because, well, you're too scared to make the, [harsh], hard choices that actually matter.
Character 1: The FDA seized our servers an hour ago and they're going to find, [grim], everything you tried to hide eventually.
491. [defiant] Good, then maybe they'll see that every, [forceful], decision I made was to protect the viability of a drug that could revolutionize treatment for millions of, [passionate], desperate patients who don't have time for pristine ethics. [exhales]
Character 1: [resigned] Well, um, I hope that revolutionary vision keeps you warm in federal prison, because that's, [cold], where we're both headed now.
492. [steady] If that's the price for trying to, [unwavering], actually help people instead of just following rules, then I'll pay it without, [final], regret.
493. [confused] I just got this message from— God, I can't even say his name without feeling like I'm twelve again. [short pause] Marcus Chen. Marcus fucking Chen just sent me this whole, um, this whole thing about how I— [bitter] how I taught him about resilience? [laugh] Are you kidding me? He made my life hell for three years, and now he's— [shaky voice] he's saying that watching me show up every day despite what he did taught him something? [long pause] I don't know how to feel about this. Part of me wants to just delete it, you know? Like, [angry] where was this revelation when I was eating lunch in the bathroom? When I was— [trailing off] But then... [hesitantly] he mentioned specific things. The science fair project he destroyed. The time with my inhaler. [sniffle] He remembers all of it. [slowly] And he's actually taking responsibility, not doing that whole "we were just kids" thing that people do. [sigh] I mean, I did keep showing up. Every single day, I kept— [emotional] maybe I was teaching something without knowing it? [confused] God, this is so messed up. Do I write back? Do I just— [frustrated] Why now? Why after fifteen years does he get to just— [very quietly] maybe he needed fifteen years to understand what he did.
494. [very melancholic] You know what's funny? Well, not funny actually—it's more like, [bitter] I spent all these hours listening to Mrs. Chen talk about how her friends just... stopped calling. And I'd sit there, [empathetically] holding her hand, telling her she wasn't alone, that I understood. [pause] But honestly, I didn't. Not really. [regretful] I mean, how could I? I had my book club on Tuesdays, err, game nights every Friday, Sarah's dinner parties... [trailing off]

[quietly] And then somehow, um, everyone just got busy. [confused] Or maybe I did? The thing is, I can't even pinpoint when it happened. Like, one day I'm texting five different group chats and [very sad] suddenly I'm scrolling through old messages at 2 AM wondering if anyone would notice if I just... disappeared. 

[crying while speaking] Mr. Rodriguez told me yesterday that loneliness feels like drowning in reverse—you know, everybody else is breathing just fine while you're gasping for air that's right there. [sniffle] And I just nodded because, [shaky voice] God, that's exactly what this is. 

[very quietly] So now when Mrs. Chen says nobody calls anymore, I don't just hold her hand. [warm] I really get it. We're both just... [long pause] waiting for someone to remember we exist.
495. Eight months. I just—I mean, I literally just counted it out on my calendar. [bitter] Eight months of "great exposure" and "invaluable experience" and, um, what exactly do I have to show for it? [pause] So like, yesterday Sarah asked me if I was excited about the new project and I'm thinking, [sarcastic] oh yeah, super excited to work another sixty hours for free while Brad gets promoted to the position they, er, supposedly don't have budget for. [angry] The thing is—God, I'm such an idiot—they kept saying, you know, "just wait until Q3" and then it was "after the merger" and now it's, [mocking] "we're restructuring but you're so valued here." [laugh] Valued! That's—honestly that's hilarious because, uhh, I can't even afford my subway pass anymore. [very sad] My parents keep asking when I'll get a "real job" and I keep defending this place like, [mumbling] oh no, it's actually a great opportunity, I'm learning so much. [furious] Learning what exactly? How to make coffee for people who make six figures? [long pause] The worst part is, I mean, I really believed them. [regretful] Like genuinely thought if I just, hmm, worked hard enough, stayed late enough... [bitter] But there was never a path, was there? [exhausted] They're already interviewing new interns for next semester. Fresh meat. [sigh] And here I am, basically, eight months older, eight months broker, and somehow still hoping they'll—[trailing off] [very quietly] God, what am I doing?
496. [warm] You know, I still remember my abuela teaching me how to fold empanadas when I was, like, seven years old. Her hands were so— [chuckle] they moved so fast, I mean, I couldn't keep up. [nostalgic] And now here I am, literally making hundreds of them every week for, um, actual paying customers. [pause] It's kind of surreal, honestly.

[excited] Last month we catered this huge corporate event and they specifically requested Mama's mole recipe— [proudly] the one she brought from Oaxaca forty years ago! I was just, [emotional], standing there watching these executives basically licking their plates clean. [laugh] My mother, er, she started crying when I showed her the reviews.

[hesitantly] The thing is, we almost didn't do this. I mean, [frustrated] everyone kept saying "Mexican food is too niche" or whatever. But then, [determined] I thought, no—these recipes fed our family through everything. [passionately] Through immigration, through poverty, through— [trailing off] everything.

[very sincerely] And now, well, we're booked solid through December. [extremely happy] My cousins are helping, my tío quit his factory job to join us, and, um— [crying while speaking] these recipes that crossed borders in my grandmother's memory are now, you know, they're our future. [sigh] Isn't that something?
497. [shaky voice] I did it. I finally—God, I actually told Jake off today. Like, right there in front of everyone, you know? [confidently] I just couldn't take it anymore, so I was like "Stop. Just stop treating me like garbage." And honestly, um, I was ready for him to hit me or whatever, but he just... [confused] he started crying? 

[pause] 

This kid who's been making my life hell for, what, two years? He's just standing there with tears running down his face, and then he's like—[very quietly] he tells me his dad beats him. That his dad calls him worthless every single day. [long pause] And I mean, here's the thing, I'm standing there thinking about all the times he shoved me into lockers, all the names he called me, and I should be, er, I should feel vindicated, right? But instead I just feel... [sad] God, I don't know. 

It's like, does that excuse what he did to me? No. Obviously not. But now I can't stop picturing him going home to that, and—[sniffle] I guess hurt people really do hurt people. [hesitantly] Maybe we're both just trying to survive in our own messed up ways. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this information. [exhausted] I really don't.
498. [shaky voice] They told me this morning, um, about the promotion. Supervisor. Me. [bitter] After three years packing boxes, I guess they figured I was—I don't know, management material or whatever. [pause] The thing is, they want me to, er, handle the restructuring. [very quietly] That's what they're calling it. Restructuring. [sarcastic] Such a clean word for it, right? 

[anxious] Miguel taught me everything, you know? Like, literally showed me how to hold the tape gun so my wrist wouldn't hurt after eight hours. [stuttering] And-and Rosa, she basically—I mean, she covered for me so many times when I was still figuring things out. [upset] Now I have to sit them down tomorrow, [clearing throat], look them in the eye and tell them their positions are being eliminated. 

[angry] Corporate says it's nothing personal, just numbers on a spreadsheet. [very sad] But Rosa's got three kids. Miguel's been here fifteen years—fifteen! [whispering] I keep thinking maybe I should just turn it down, but honestly, I need this. [regretful] My mom's medical bills are—anyway. [long pause]

[crying while speaking] How do I even start that conversation? Hey guys, remember when you taught me everything? [monotone] Well, thanks for that, here's your pink slip. [sniffle] God, I feel like such a—[trailing off] I don't even know what I am anymore.
499. [extremely happy] We actually did it! I mean, honestly, when we started this whole thing eighteen months ago, I—[laugh] everyone thought we were crazy, you know? Running on climate action and, like, actual justice reform? [pause] But here's the thing, um, people were ready for it. They were so ready. 

[warm] All those volunteers who showed up at five in the morning to knock on doors in the rain—God, I'm getting emotional just thinking about it. [sniffle] It's just that, er, nobody believed we could beat the machine, right? The oil money, the—[bitter] the attack ads calling us radical extremists for wanting clean air. 

[relieved] But we just kept going. And tonight, [very slowly] when they called it... I couldn't even process it at first. Like, wait wait wait, did they really just say we won? [gasp softly] By eight points! 

[passionately] This means we can actually implement the green jobs program! The community solar initiative, the—oh my God, the criminal justice reforms we promised. [shaky voice] Those families we met, they're finally going to get... [trailing off] 

[very sincerely] I guess what I'm trying to say is, um, we proved something tonight. That you can run on hope and science and, well, actually win.
500. Wait, you're not—you're not serious. [shaky voice] Margaret, this check, it's... [pause] I can't take this from you. [hesitantly] You come in every morning for your cranberry scone and, um, we talk about your grandkids and the weather and— [overwhelmed] this is fifty thousand dollars. [gasp loudly] I mentioned the expansion thing like, what, twice? [confused] Maybe three times when I was complaining about the oven breaking?

[crying while speaking] You wrote "for someone who makes every morning brighter" on the memo line. Margaret, I just—I make pastries. [sniffle] That's all I do. [very quietly] You don't even know if I'm good at business or if I'll— [trailing off]

[laugh] Oh God, you're smiling at me like you always do when I overthink the croissant pricing. [warm] Seven years, Margaret. Seven years you've been coming here and I... [emotional] I never knew you were listening that carefully. Well, I mean, [stuttering] I-I knew you listened but not like— [pause] not like this.

[extremely happy] You believe in me. [whispered] You actually believe in my stupid little dream about the second location. [crying while speaking] I don't even know what to—how do you thank someone for changing your entire life?
501. [very excited] Oh my God, I just—I can't even process this right now, like, they actually said yes! [laugh] Seven years, you know? Seven whole years of, um, basically proving myself over and over, and honestly [pause] it finally happened. [emotional] I keep thinking about Marcus, who, er, stayed late with me on that first project when I was just—[trailing off] And Sarah, God, Sarah who literally taught me everything about, well, about believing in myself when I was ready to quit. [sniffle] 

The thing is, [passionately] this isn't just about me getting some fancy title, right? I mean, [very sincerely] every single person who lifted me up, who, uh, who saw something in me when I couldn't see it myself—they're all getting promoted with me, in a way. [warm] Like, emotionally, spiritually, I don't know, [laugh softly] does that make sense? 

[confidently] Here's what I'm gonna do though—I'm using this position to, um, to actually change things. No more of that, you know, climbing the ladder and pulling it up behind you garbage. [animated] I'm keeping that ladder down, hell, I'm building more ladders! [determined] Because honestly, success means nothing if you're standing up there alone, right? [very quietly] Mom always said that. [emotional] She'd be so proud.
502. [frustrated] They can't afford patient advocacy. Um, that's—that's what they actually said to me. The hospital, right, this massive institution that charges, what, eight hundred dollars for aspirin? [bitter] They can't afford to keep the one person who helps patients navigate their medical debt. [pause] I mean, honestly, I fought for two years to create this position. Two years of, like, presentations and budget proposals and showing them how much money we actually saved by, you know, preventing bankruptcies and keeping people from just—[angry] God, the irony is just... [sigh] 

So basically, what happens now to Mrs. Chen who's, er, drowning in chemo bills? Or that kid—[very sad] that nineteen-year-old with type 1 diabetes who literally rations his insulin? [shaky voice] I was the only one helping them understand payment plans, charity care, I mean—[pause] The CFO looked me straight in the eye and said, [mocking] "We have to prioritize core operations." [furious] Core operations! As if, hmm, keeping people from losing their homes after cancer treatment isn't core to what a hospital should— [trailing off]

[exhausted] Anyway, they're giving me thirty days. Thirty days to, uh, wrap up active cases and just... abandon everyone else. [very quietly] Five years of this work, and they're just... [sniffle] it's done.
503. [defensive] I know what you're thinking, okay? I can see it in your face every time I get up to check. But you don't understand—it's not like I want to be doing this. [pause] Ten minutes isn't that often, honestly. Some parents check every five. I read that online. [anxious] And the way she breathes sometimes, it's so quiet, you can barely even tell if she's—I mean, what if something happens and we don't notice? [shaky voice] What if we're those parents on the news who just... didn't check?

[frustrated] You keep saying I need help, but this IS me helping. This is me making sure our baby is safe. [very quietly] I set timers on my phone. Three alarms rotating so I don't miss one. [crying while speaking] I haven't slept more than twenty minutes at a time in weeks and I know, I know that's not normal but I can't stop. [pause] Every time I try to skip a check, my chest gets so tight I can't breathe.

[exhausted] Maybe you're right. [long pause] Maybe this isn't actually keeping her safer. [very meekly] I just... I love her so much it physically hurts, you know? And if anything happened because I didn't check... [trailing off]
504. [extremely happy] Oh my god, she did it! I mean, honestly, when Sarah walked into that room with those two, um, I was so—[anxious] I thought for sure she'd freeze up, you know? Like she always does when there's confrontation. But then, [gasp softly] the way she just, er, took control? [laugh] I'm sitting there behind the glass thinking "is this really my little dove?" 

[pause] 

She was so—[warm] god, I'm actually getting emotional about this. [sniffle] Six months ago she couldn't even, like, order coffee without rehearsing it first. And today? [excited] Today she's in there saying things like "I hear what you're both saying" and actually, hmm, meaning it! [chuckle] The thing is, I kept wanting to jump in, right? When that first guy started raising his voice, I literally had my hand on the door handle. [quickly] But then Sarah did this thing where she—[impressed] she just took this deep breath and goes "let's take a moment," and honestly? [laugh loudly] They listened! 

[very sincerely] I guess what I'm trying to say is, um, I'm just so damn proud of her. [trailing off] All those practice sessions where she'd turn bright red and stammer... [smiling speaking] Look at her now.
505. You have got to be kidding me. [bitter] This is the same person who literally sat across from me and said—what was it—"your idea lacks scalability." [sarcastic] Oh, and my favorite part, um, "maybe you should consider getting more experience first." [laugh] More experience! Well, I mean, here we are five years later, and I've built three successful companies while they're, you know, [pause] asking ME for help. 

The thing is, like, I should probably feel vindicated, right? [confused] But honestly, it's more just... hmm, I don't know. [slowly] Part of me wants to say yes just to, er, prove something. But prove what exactly? [frustrated] That I was right all along? They already know that—that's why they're calling! 

[sigh] And actually, their email was so, um, casual about it too. Like we're old friends or something. "Hey, I've been following your success"—[mocking] oh, NOW you're following my success? Where was that energy when I was literally begging for, what, fifty thousand dollars? 

[long pause] 

I guess the real question is whether I can, you know, [hesitantly] actually help their entrepreneurs without being... bitter about the whole thing. Because those kids deserve better than my, uh, my baggage. [warm] They deserve someone who believes in them from day one.
506. [bitter] Thirty-two years. Thirty-two years I've kept these women safe, and now they shut me down [pause] right when I'd finally set up the vocational program. [frustrated] The timing is just—I mean, we had interviews lined up, um, real opportunities at the hotel, the salon downtown. [angry] They don't care about that, do they? [sigh] The cops, the mayor, they see us as criminals, but I've been protecting these girls since— [very melancholic] since before half of them were even born. [shaky voice] Maria was going to start her nursing program next month. I'd already paid her tuition. [upset] And Sophie, she's got her kids to think about, you know? [clearing throat] What's she supposed to do now, honestly, go back on the street? [passionately] That's what they don't understand—I was their safety net, their way out when they were ready. [regretful] Maybe I should've started the transition program sooner, but, well, I thought we had more time. [very quietly] Twenty-three women counting on me, and I— [cry] I failed them. [exhausted] All those years building something that actually protected people, and they tear it down in one afternoon.
507. [shaky voice] I can't—I mean, the accelerant patterns are, they're unmistakable. [long pause] Three weeks. For three weeks I've been sitting with them, um, bringing them coffee, telling them we'd find who did this to their home. [bitter] And the whole time they knew—God, they sat there crying while I promised them justice. [frustrated] The pour patterns, they lead directly from the garage through the kitchen, exactly where, uh, where Michael said he was sleeping when it started. Nobody sleeps through that smell, [angry] nobody. And Sarah, she kept asking me, like, really specific questions about insurance investigations, and I thought—[very quietly] I thought she was just anxious about the claim. [gasp softly] Their daughter's toys. They moved all of Emma's toys to the shed the day before. Who does that? [confused] I mean, honestly, who thinks to reorganize storage right before your house randomly catches fire? [sarcastic] Such convenient timing, right? The financial records I pulled this morning, they're basically—[exhaling sharply] they're drowning in debt. Two mortgages, credit cards maxed, and then boom, mysterious fire. [very sad] That little girl hugged me yesterday. Emma hugged me and said thank you for helping mommy and daddy. [whispering] How do I even write this report? [pause] They played me. [enunciating every word] They looked me in the eye and played me.
508. [gasp softly] Oh my God, I just—I can't even process this right now. They left a note? About me? [pause] I mean, I just make coffee, you know? I smile, I ask about people's days, it's not... [shaky voice] "Your cheerful service helped me through cancer treatment." Cancer. This whole time they were fighting cancer and I had no idea. [sniffle] I just thought they looked tired sometimes, um, maybe stressed from work or something. But they were—God, they were going through chemo? [crying while speaking] And somehow my stupid little jokes about the weather or asking if they wanted extra whipped cream actually mattered? [long pause] I keep reading it over and over. [very quietly] "You made the hardest days bearable." How do you even respond to that? Like, I'm just some person with an apron making lattes and apparently—apparently that meant something. [warm] All those mornings, they chose to come to my cart. Not the fancy place across the street, but here, to me. [emotional tremor] Maybe that's all we really need to do, honestly. Just show up and be kind. Because you never know who's barely holding it together, who needs that one bright spot. [deep breath] Wow. I'm definitely keeping this note forever.
509. [hesitantly] They called me into the office this morning and I thought—I honestly thought I was getting let go too. [nervous laugh] But then Richards starts talking about, um, "exceptional performance during challenging times" and [confused] I'm sitting there watching Sarah pack her desk through the glass wall. [long pause] Twenty-three years she's been here. [very sad] Her daughter just started college and now she's—[clearing throat] anyway, they're making me Senior Restructuring Advisor. [bitter] That's what they're calling it. I get to help decide who else [slowly] doesn't make the cut. [sigh] Like, congratulations, here's more money to basically tell your friends they're redundant. [upset] Tom already knows he's next week—he told me at lunch, [voice shaking] crying into his sandwich. And I just sat there knowing I'd be the one writing his termination memo. [very quietly] How do I even celebrate this? My wife wants to take me to dinner but [trailing off] I mean, what am I supposed to say? [sarcastic] "Honey, great news, I got promoted because everyone else got fired"? [long pause] I keep thinking about Sarah's face when security walked her out. [regretful] Maybe I should've just—[frustrated] God, I don't know what's right anymore.
510. [gasp softly] I just opened the box and it's—oh my God, it's all of Mrs. Chen's recipes. [crying while speaking] Every single one, handwritten on these little index cards with, um, notes in the margins about which grandchild liked what. I only ever... I mean, all I did was save her a maple bar every Thursday and ask about her week. [sniffle] That's literally all I did.

[warm] She wrote on this envelope here—"For the sweet girl who never let me eat alone." I didn't even realize she was... [trailing off] I thought she just liked talking while she had her coffee. [very quietly] God, I should've done more. Should've sat with her longer or, like, I don't know, invited her for actual dinner or something.

[chuckle] This one says "Arthur's favorite - make when you miss someone." Arthur was her husband. She told me about him every week. [empathetically] These aren't just recipes, they're her whole life, you know? Sixty years of birthdays and holidays and—[gasp] wait, this one's from her mother. From Shanghai. It's in Chinese and English.

[very sincerely] How do you even thank someone for something like this? She basically just handed me her family's heart.
511. Sarah just sent me this email and I—honestly, I wasn't expecting this at all. [warm] She said that thing I told her about not burning bridges when you leave a job? Well, apparently she almost sent this really angry resignation letter to her old boss—I mean, the guy was terrible to her—but then she remembered our conversation. [chuckle] And now, um, that same boss just recommended her for this incredible position at another company.

[pause]

God, you know, I basically torched my entire network when I left my first real job. [regretful] Like, I was so young and just... angry about everything. Sent this absolutely scathing email to everyone—literally everyone—on my way out. [sigh] Took me, what, five years to rebuild those relationships? Some of them never really recovered.

But Sarah, she's—[relieved] she actually listened to me. The thing is, I never knew if any of my advice was actually, er, getting through, you know? [emotional] Sometimes you mentor someone and you're basically just talking into the void, hoping something sticks. 

[very sincerely] And here's this kid, avoiding all the stupid mistakes I made, actually learning from my disasters. It's like... [trailing off] I don't know, maybe all those mistakes were worth something after all.
512. [relieved] Oh my God, she actually did it. I mean, we just got the call and it's—it's official. [pause] The arts funding bill passed. Like, it actually passed. All those underfunded schools are going to have, you know, real music programs and art supplies and—[excited] sorry, I'm just—wow. 

Honestly, when we first pitched this idea, um, everyone said it was political suicide. "Nobody cares about arts education," they said. [frustrated] "Focus on test scores," right? But she just—[proudly] she believed in it. And God, the pushback we got. I mean, the late nights going over budget numbers, trying to find, er, creative ways to make the math work. [chuckle] There was this one meeting where I literally thought she was going to throw her coffee at the finance committee chair.

[very sincerely] But those kids, you know? They're going to have paintbrushes and, like, instruments and actual opportunities to—[voice breaking] sorry, I'm getting all emotional. It's just, um, when you grow up without that stuff yourself, and then you get to be part of making sure other kids don't have to... [sniffle] 

[happy] She called me her secret weapon. Can you believe that? Me. The one who couldn't even, uh, afford crayons in third grade. [laugh] Now look at us.
Character 1: [shaky voice] Mr. Romano, I heard from the landlord that you're, [upset], closing the shop next month after sixty years of work.
513. [bitter] Well, um, my hands aren't what they used to be, and, I mean, [frustrated], nobody wants to learn this trade anymore, so, er, [trailing off], what's the point of keeping the doors open...
Character 1: The museum's entire collection of nineteenth-century boots depends on your, [passionately], expertise, and, well, um, there's literally nobody else who knows how to work with those materials anymore.
514. You know, I've been trying to find an apprentice for, um, [regretful], fifteen years now, but these kids today want to, well, [very quietly], work with computers, not their hands. [sigh]
Character 1: [anxious] Listen, the techniques you use for Victorian leather are, [empathetically], completely undocumented anywhere, and when you close, [desperately], all that knowledge just disappears forever. [pause]
515. [warm] I mean, um, I appreciate what you're saying, but, well, [slowly], my arthritis is getting worse and I can barely, [exhausted], thread a needle some mornings anymore.
Character 1: [pleading] Well, um, what if we documented everything you know through, er, [excited], video interviews and demonstrations while you can still, [hesitantly], show us the techniques even if you can't do them perfectly? [gasp softly]
516. Nobody's going to watch some old man, um, [melancholic], ramble about leather conditioning and nineteenth-century stitching patterns, I mean, that's just not how the world works anymore. [groan]
Character 1: [confidently] Actually, um, our preservation grant includes funding for, well, [animated], master craftsman documentation projects, and we could pay you to, er, [formally], teach workshops at the museum while recording everything.
517. [curious] You'd actually pay me to teach people who might, [skeptical], never even use these skills?
Character 1: [whispering] Um, well, please.
518. [thoughtful] The thing is, this work requires years of, [stern], practice and most people give up when they realize how, [sincerely], difficult it really is to do properly.
Character 1: [determined] But even if only one person learns from you, that's, [urgently], one more person than exists right now who can preserve these, [quickly], irreplaceable artifacts that tell our history. [laugh]
519. [relieved] Well, um, I suppose if the museum is serious about this, I mean, [hopeful], maybe there's still time to pass on what my grandfather taught me before his, er, [sad], hands gave out too. [long pause]
Character 1: [delighted] So, um, you'll consider staying open a bit longer while we, well, [enthusiastically], set up the documentation project?
520. [resigned] My wife always said I was too stubborn to, [chuckling], retire anyway, and if someone actually wants to learn these old, [nostalgic], techniques, maybe I owe it to my grandfather's memory. [cough]
Character 1: [grateful] This means everything to our collection and to, [emotionally], preserving a craft that connects us to our past.
521. Just promise me you'll find someone with, [seriously], steady hands and patience who won't give up.
Character 1: I'll personally screen every applicant until we find someone who, [determined], understands what's at stake here and has the dedication to, [firmly], honor your legacy. [sniffle]
522. [accepting] Then I suppose this old shop has a few, [wistful], more months of life in it after all.
Character 1: [bitter] Funny coincidence. [pause]
523. [withdrawn] Well, um, I've been watching you train for, [hesitantly], three months now and, like, [slowly], there's something I need to tell you before, [shaky voice], we continue with these sessions. [sigh]
Character 1: [cynical] Yeah, um, let me guess, you know, [frustrated], you've figured out I make my living pretending to be, [trailing off], someone more successful than I'll ever actually be...
524. [defensive] It's not about your work, [anxious], it's about why you look exactly like, [whispering], my son who became famous doing the very moves I'm, [very quietly], teaching you now.
Character 1: [shocked] Wait, um, are you saying that, I mean, [confused], the reason I can pass for Jason Chen is because, well, [trembling], you think we're somehow related or, like, [loudly], what exactly are you implying here?
525. [regretful] Not implying anything.
Character 1: [angry] So, um, you're telling me that, er, [bitterly], thirty-two years of wondering why I looked nothing like my adoptive parents comes down to this? [laugh]
526. The adoption agency promised they'd place you, [crying while speaking], far from California where no one would, [monotone], make the connection between you and the son I, [ashamed], kept.
Character 1: [furious] Well, jokes on them, I mean, [sarcastic], I moved here specifically to capitalize on looking exactly like your golden child. [cough]
527. [apologetic] Every technique I taught him, [very sad], every stance and philosophy that made him famous, [whispering loudly], I've been teaching you these past months without, [clearing throat], realizing I was giving you your birthright.
Character 1: Um, my birthright was, like, [upset], supposedly being loved equally but instead getting, well, [coldly], tossed away while you kept the one you, [passionately], thought had more potential, right?
528. [desperate] It wasn't about potential, [quickly], it was about your mother's family threatening to, [stern], take both of you if I didn't, [nervously], let them place one for adoption. [long pause]
Character 1: [exhausted] All these years I've been, [hollow], copying his moves from movies.
529. [warm] Those moves were originally meant for, [empathetically], both of you to learn together as brothers.
Character 1: [disgusted] You know, um, the real kicker is that, I mean, [mocking], I'm actually better at the techniques than he is because, well, [speeding up], I had to study every micro-movement to survive as his shadow.
530. That dedication and precision, [proudly], those are traits you inherited from, [chuckle], our family's bloodline.
Character 1: Don't say our.
531. Please let me explain. [gasp]
Character 1: [resigned] The only thing that matters now is whether you'll, [formal], keep teaching me or not.
532. [determined] I'll teach you everything I, [hopeful], should have taught you thirty years ago if you'll, [pleading], let me. [sniffle]
Character 1: [hesitantly] I keep, um, looking at your hands while you're explaining the drilling process and, [shaky voice], there's this scar across your knuckles that I, well, [quietly], remember from a long time ago.
533. [confused] Well, uh, I've had this scar for about, [slowly], twenty years from pulling a kid out of, er, [pause], that old quarry that used to flood every spring before they, [trailing off], filled it in.
Character 1: That kid was me and I've been, [trembling], searching for you ever since my parents moved us away without letting me, [emotional], thank the person who dove thirty feet into black water to, [crying while speaking], pull me back up when everyone else just stood there frozen.
534. [shocked] You were that little one with the, [very quietly], red swimsuit who went under near the rock ledge and, [anxious], didn't come back up while all those teenagers were, [empathetically], screaming but not doing anything to actually help you.
Character 1: [warm] I still have nightmares about the cold and the dark but they always end with, [relieved], your arms pulling me toward the light.
535. [bitter] Never forgave myself for not getting there faster because you weren't, [regretful], breathing when I finally got you to the surface.
Character 1: But you did CPR for, um, what felt like forever while everyone else was, [frustrated], panicking or filming with their phones instead of, well, [angry], calling for actual help or doing anything useful.
536. [exhausted] Yeah, well, I just kept pumping your chest and breathing into your lungs until, um, [hopefully], you finally coughed up all that muddy water.
Character 1: The paramedics said you saved my life twice that day—once in, [grateful], the water and once on the shore when my heart had, [whispering], already stopped beating.
537. [very sincerely] I think about that day whenever I'm drilling through rock and hit water because it reminds me that, [passionate], sometimes the most dangerous things can also be, [contemplative], the most necessary for life.
Character 1: [cheerful] My therapist says I've been unconsciously looking for you in every, [curious], person I meet which explains why I always gravitate toward people with, [playful], calloused hands and patient eyes who seem like they'd jump into danger without thinking twice. [laugh]
538. [surprised] Never expected to see you again.
Character 1: [excited] I have this shoebox full of newspaper clippings about the rescue that, um, [nostalgic], my mom saved even though she could never talk about it without, er, [sad], crying because she thought she'd lost me forever that afternoon.
539. Well, uh, seeing you here all grown up and working in this building makes me feel like, [happy], maybe some things happen for a reason even if, um, [reflective], it takes decades to understand why.
Character 1: [confident] Would you let me buy you dinner tonight so I can finally, [sincere], properly thank you for giving me these twenty extra years I wouldn't have had?
540. Sure, um, okay.
Character 1: I've rehearsed this moment, er, a thousand times in my head but now that you're here I just keep, [overwhelmed], thinking about how different everything would have been if you, well, [very melancholic], hadn't been there that day.
541. Well, um, I was just, [humble], doing what anyone should have done in that situation.
Character 1: But you were the only one who actually did it and that's, um, [tearful], the difference between being a good person and actually, well, [firm], saving someone's life when it matters most.
542. [touched] I'm glad you made it worth it by, [proud], living a life that brought you here to this moment where we could, [peaceful], finally close this circle that started in, [content], such a dark and terrifying place all those years ago.
Character 1: [shocked] The city sent me here to issue, [stern], a cease and desist order for noise violations but I never expected, [shaky voice], to find you performing here after, [bitter], five years of complete silence.
543. So they actually sent you, [frustrated], of all people to shut down the only thing keeping me, [very sad], alive these days.
Character 1: [apologetic] Look, I didn't know this was your venue when I took the case, [hesitantly], but the neighbors have filed seventeen complaints and, [regretful], the law is clear.
544. [anxious] Well, um, I mean, the thing is, [crying while speaking], this place saved me after everything fell apart when dad, uh, you know, [trailing off], when he died and you just disappeared into your government job.
Character 1: You think I disappeared into my work, [angry], but you're the one who chose music over showing up to his funeral, [loudly], over being there when mom needed us most.
545. [defensive] I was on tour in Europe when he had the stroke and by the time, [whispering], I got the message it was too late to make it back, [very quietly], and you knew that but chose to blame me, [pause], anyway.
Character 1: [exhausted] Um, I've been carrying this paperwork for, like, three weeks trying to find the courage to serve it.
546. [confused] Wait, so you knew, um, you knew it was me all along and still, well, came here anyway?
Character 1: [warm] The truth is I've been standing outside your shows for months, [empathetically], listening through the walls because I missed hearing you play, [very melancholic], but I couldn't face walking through that door until, [sigh], work forced my hand.
547. [surprised] You've been, umm, I mean, you've actually been out there, [hopeful], listening to my new stuff even after everything that, uh, happened between us, [emotional], even after all the horrible things we, like, said to each other?
Character 1: [tearful] Well, um, every song you write reminds me of when we were kids and, I mean, you'd play guitar while I did homework and, [nostalgic], everything felt possible back then.
548. [relieved] God, I wrote a whole album about losing you and dad, [passionate], about how the silence between us became louder than any music I could create, [very sincerely], about how success means nothing when the only person who really understood my music, [chuckle], won't even answer my calls.
Character 1: The policy board gave me thirty days to resolve this case, [monotone], or they'll send enforcement.
549. So that's it then, [defeated], you're really going to shut me down. [groan]
Character 1: [determined] Actually, there's a provision for cultural venues if we can prove, [quickly], community benefit and implement soundproofing measures.
550. You'd do that for me after, um, after everything, even though I mean, we haven't spoken in years and, well, I basically blamed you for, like, choosing your career over family?
Character 1: [thankful] Mom called me last week and said she heard you dedicated a song to dad at your last show, [gentle], and that maybe it was time we both stopped being so stubborn, [hopeful], that maybe we could find our way back to being siblings who actually, [laugh], talk to each other.
551. [eager] I have this new piece I've been working on about reconciliation and second chances, [nervously], and I was wondering if maybe you could help me with the legal terminology for the bridge section, [playful], since you always were better with words than me.
Character 1: Only if you promise to, um, install proper sound dampening within, I mean, two weeks and keep the volume below city ordinances after, well, ten PM because, [professional], I still have a job to do even if, [loving], I desperately want my brother back in my life.
552. [grateful] I'll start the renovations tomorrow if it means we can try to rebuild this, [determined], whatever this becomes between us now that we're different people than we were five years ago, [cautiously optimistic], maybe even better people who learned from our mistakes. [sniffle]
Character 1: [hesitantly] So, um, your test results are perfectly normal but, [confused], I'm noticing some unusual neural patterns that, well, don't typically appear in standard fertility consultations, you know.
553. [nervous] The collective didn't prepare me for this moment of, [anxious], individual vulnerability when discussing something so personal that even they, [quietly], cannot fully comprehend or share.
Character 1: [surprised] Wait, did you just say collective, because that's, [shocked], not something I've ever encountered in twenty years of practice, [very quietly], and I'm trying to understand what exactly, [trailing off], you're telling me here. [pause]
554. [authentic] Well, um, we are many minds sharing this body but, [empathetically], this particular desire for offspring feels, [conflicted], uniquely mine even though, er, everything I am belongs to them too. [sigh]
Character 1: [professional] Um, I need to understand, like, whether treating you means, [carefully], treating one person or somehow addressing an entire network of consciousness, I mean.
555. [defensive] We came here, well, I came here, um, because this body's reproductive capacity is, [frustrated], failing and the others don't understand why I, [bitter], care so much about something so individually human, you know.
Character 1: [warm] Every patient who walks through my door has complex feelings about reproduction, [gently], whether they're dealing with societal pressure or family expectations or, [thoughtfully], apparently collective consciousness disagreements. [chuckle]
556. [vulnerable] Um, sometimes when I'm alone in this examination room, well, I can almost, [whispering], pretend to be singular and, er, make decisions without feeling their confusion and disapproval. [long pause]
Character 1: [softly] Um, well, I understand.
557. Well, you really don't though, um, because when billions of thoughts flow through you constantly, [overwhelmed], wanting something for just yourself feels like, [guilty], the ultimate betrayal, you know.
Character 1: [reassuring] Look, um, I may not understand hive consciousness but, well, I've seen how, [passionate], the biological drive to reproduce can create conflict even within, [sincerely], single individuals wrestling with their own contradictory desires, I mean.
558. [curious] Can you actually help someone whose body belongs to many but whose, [desperate], longing for a child seems to belong to, [sad], just this one fragmenting part?
Character 1: My job is treating the person sitting in front of me with, [determined], whatever reproductive challenges they're facing regardless of how many consciousnesses they contain.
559. [relieved] The others are listening through me right now and they're, [uncomfortable], struggling to process why this matters when we could just, [coldly], acquire offspring through the collective's resources. [gasp softly]
Character 1: [firmly] Well, um, biological parenthood isn't just about acquisition, er, it's about the profound transformation that happens when, [intensely], your genetic material combines with another's to create something entirely, [excited], new and unpredictable, you know.
560. [trembling] That's exactly what terrifies them most about my, [shaky voice], desire to reproduce individually.
Character 1: [understanding] The medical treatment is straightforward enough with hormone therapy and assisted reproductive technologies, [concerned], but the real question is whether you're prepared for how parenthood might, [seriously], change your relationship with the collective.
561. [resolved] After sharing every thought and feeling for decades within the collective, [lonely], maybe I need to create something that's connected to me in a way that's, [hopeful], purely biological rather than mental.
Character 1: Then we should begin treatment immediately while you still have, [urgently], this clarity of individual purpose. [exhale]
562. I know they're already debating whether to, well, override this decision but, [bravely], for once I'm going to act before consensus forms, um, even if it means risking everything, er, I've ever been. [cry]
Character 1: [hesitantly] I, um, appreciate you meeting me so quickly because, well, I've been, [anxious], selling products my whole life but I've never had to, [shaky voice], figure out how to give something this, [quietly], meaningful away before.
563. Well, I mean, inheriting an estate while grieving is, [empathetically], one of the most challenging experiences anyone faces, and, um, the fact that you're thinking about, [warm], philanthropy during this time shows remarkable, [sincerely], character and strength. [pause]
Character 1: [relieved] My mother's estate is worth about twelve million dollars which, [confused], seems impossible because she lived so, [slowly], modestly her entire life. [sigh]
564. Um, many people who accumulate wealth, you know, choose to live below their means because, [passionately], they find more value in security or, well, [gently], future giving than in present consumption.
Character 1: The truth is we hadn't spoken in, [bitter], five years when she passed and now suddenly I'm supposed to, [frustrated], honor her wishes about charities she cared about more than, [trembling], her own daughter apparently.
565. Sometimes people express love through, [cautiously], legacy giving in ways they couldn't express, [sad], directly in life due to complicated family dynamics.
Character 1: [crying while speaking] I mean, um, she left detailed notes about every charity but not, well, [angry], a single personal message for me except, you know, [whispering], instructions to contact you about managing her, [trailing off], philanthropic vision.
566. [apologetic] Well, I actually, um, have something else here that she, er, [nervously], asked me to give you only after we'd discussed, [clearing throat], the charitable distributions first because she thought you'd, [carefully], understand her better through her giving choices. [long pause]
Character 1: Um, wait, you mean she left me something personal after all but, well, [shocked], made it conditional on me learning about, er, [loudly], her charitable interests first? [gasp]
567. [formal] She believed that understanding someone's values through, [confidently], their philanthropic choices reveals their, [proudly], deepest beliefs and hopes.
Character 1: [whispering loudly] That's so her.
568. [excited] Well, um, let me show you her giving portfolio which includes, er, [animated], education initiatives for teenage mothers, addiction recovery programs, and, you know, [smiling speaking], family reconciliation counseling services.
Character 1: Um, those are all things that, well, [stunned], affected our relationship directly. [cough]
569. [very quietly] She specifically earmarked three million for a program that, [emotionally], helps mothers and daughters rebuild relationships after, [regretful], long estrangements. [sniffle]
Character 1: [tearfully] She was trying to fix things for other people that we never could fix ourselves.
570. [delighted] She also left instructions that if you choose to be involved with, [hopefully], any of these charities personally rather than just, [cheerful], financially.  [laugh]
Character 1: [curious] You know, um, I've spent twenty years, well, [thoughtfully], convincing people to buy things they don't need and maybe it's, [determined], time I learned how to give instead. [deep pitch]
571. [playful] Well, I mean, your sales experience could actually be, er, [overly polite], invaluable in fundraising because philanthropy is really just, [joking], selling hope instead of products.
Character 1: Um, er, maybe working on her charities will help me, [very melancholic], understand who she really was. [groan]
572. [friendly] Here's her letter for you which she revised, [speeding up], forty-seven times according to my records because she wanted every word to, [monotone], convey exactly what she couldn't say in person about how proud she was of, [very excited], who you've become despite everything.
Character 1: This is, [warm], perfect timing.
573. [formal] I appreciate you coming in today to discuss your startup's, [curious], intellectual property needs and potential patent applications.
Character 1: [overly polite] You've represented some impressive clients, especially that biotech firm that's been, [excited], all over the news lately. [chuckle]
574. [confidently] My work with them has been, [hesitantly], quite extensive though of course I can't, [stern], discuss specifics due to attorney-client privilege which I'm sure you, [trailing off], understand completely...
Character 1: [friendly] Oh absolutely, um, I mean, professional discretion is, well, [empathetically], everything in our line of work, and er, I wouldn't dream of, [playful], putting you in an uncomfortable position, you know. [sigh]
575. Well, um, let's focus on your company's needs because, [anxious], from what you've described, er, your technology sounds remarkably similar to, [slowly], certain innovations I've seen before. [pause]
Character 1: [innocent] Um, great minds think alike, I mean, right? Well, [enthusiastic], parallel development happens all the time in tech, and, [quickly], that's why I need someone like you, you know.
576. [thoughtful] I suppose that's true, though the timing is, well, [suspicious], rather coincidental wouldn't you say?
Character 1: You know, um, I've been working on this for, [passionately], three years in my garage, well, long before that biotech company even, er, [bitter], got their funding rounds going.
577. [very quietly] That's interesting because their initial patent filings date back, [confused], five years.
Character 1: [cheerful] Patents are public record so naturally I've, [dismissive], studied the landscape to ensure we're not, [nervously], infringing on anything.
578. [coldly] Public patents yes, but their trade secrets and, [angry], unpublished provisional applications are another matter entirely, and somehow your pitch deck, [whispering], contains exact terminology from their confidential documents. [gasp softly]
Character 1: I mean, um, that's quite an accusation to, [shocked], make without any proof, you know.
579. [furious] Well, um, proof?
Character 3: [regretful] Look, I think we both know why you're really here, and um, [disappointed], it's not for legal representation but to, er, [tired], fish for information about my client's upcoming product launch, isn't it?
Character 1: [defensive] I came here, um, in good faith seeking legitimate legal counsel and, well, [frustrated], now you're treating me like some kind of, er, [shaky voice], corporate spy or something.
580. [knowing] The hidden recording device in your briefcase suggests otherwise, though I must, [mocking], admire your commitment to the, [sarcastic], innocent entrepreneur act you've been performing. [laugh]
Character 1: [defeated] Well, um, I suppose there's no point in, er, [very quietly], continuing this charade anymore.
581. [relieved] Security is already on their way up, and my client's legal team will be, [determined], very interested to learn who, [grimly], sent you here to infiltrate my office.
Character 1: You know, um, I almost had you going there for a while, and well, [ruefully], that biotech company should really, er, [whispered], reconsider who they trust with their secrets. [long pause]
Character 1: [cold] Well, um, I never expected to see you in this, [bitter], warehouse again after what happened with those, I mean, Burgundy shipments back in 2019.
582. [mocking] Still clinging to that, [dismissive], old story about how I supposedly ruined your precious wine empire?
Character 1: [curt] Um, the documentation mysteriously vanishing right before customs inspection wasn't, like, [furious], coincidence when you were the only one with access to those, well, shipping codes.
583. [condescending] You know, um, maybe if you'd spent less time, [sarcastic], obsessing over tannin levels and more time understanding, [clearing throat], international shipping regulations, you wouldn't have needed someone like me to, I mean, clean up your messes. [laugh]
Character 1: [frustrated] I mean, those bottles were worth half a million dollars and you, um, [angry], knew exactly which forms to lose and which inspectors to, well, [trembling], avoid calling.
584. [distant] The customs world operates on, [hard], different principles than your pretentious tasting rooms where people, [slowly], swirl glasses and pretend to taste hints of leather and tobacco. [sigh]
Character 1: Those wines represented years of, [passionately], cultivating relationships with growers who trusted me to, [shaky voice], bring their life's work to new markets. [groan]
585. [overly polite] Well, um, perhaps you should have considered that before you, like, [coolly], cut me out of the partnership when things started getting, you know, profitable.
Character 1: [whispering] That's not true.
586. [stern] Um, I kept every email where you discussed, [bitterly], replacing me with your sommelier friends who'd work for, well, [loudly], prestige instead of actual equity.
Character 1: [defensive] You were skimming profits and, [anxiously], falsifying import dates to avoid paying proper duties while I was, [very quietly], trying to build something legitimate.
587. Um, legitimate is just another word for, [mocking loudly], naive in this business, you know. [cough]
Character 1: Every vintage that rotted in customs because of your, [furious], paperwork games was someone's legacy destroyed.
588. [coldly] Um, well, I mean—whatever. [laugh hard]
Character 1: [regretful] The irony is that I actually, [hesitantly], respected your knowledge before you decided to, [exhausted], weaponize it against everything we built. [pause]
589. [monotone] Respect doesn't pay rent or, [quickly], cover medical bills when your business partner decides you're expendable.
Character 1: I, um, offered you a buyout that was more than, [confused], fair but you wanted to, like, [speeding up], destroy everything instead of just walking away with dignity, I mean.
590. [harsh] Dignity is a luxury for people who haven't been, [betrayed], stabbed in the back by someone they trusted completely.
Character 1: [very sad] Maybe we both lost more than just, [whispering loudly], wine and money in this whole, [trailing off], mess we created together… [deep pitch] and maybe that's what hurts the most.
591. [quietly] The bottles are gone, the partnership is, [dead], ash, and all we have left are these, [brokenly], accusations echoing in an empty warehouse.
Character 1: [hesitantly] I found the draft on your computer when I was returning your laptop and, [shaky voice], I need to know why you did this for me.
592. You weren't supposed to know.
Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, I know now and it's making me feel like, [frustrated], everything I thought I earned is just, [quietly], another lie I've been telling myself, you know? [sigh]
593. [warm] I mean, look, the essay was just words on paper but, [empathetically], the acceptance came from your grades improving and, um, your volunteer hours that you actually did.
Character 1: But the essay is what made them, [anxious], see past my record and give me a chance when, [trailing off], nobody else would have looked twice at someone like me.
594. [relieved] Well, um, I watched you struggle for months trying to, [slowly], put your story into words that, er, wouldn't scare them away. [laugh]
Character 1: [upset] So, uh, you just decided to fix me like I'm some, [angry], broken project you could put on your college applications, I mean?
595. That's not what this was.
Character 1: [crying while speaking] You know, um, I've been walking around campus feeling like, [proudly], I finally made something of myself but it's all, [whispering], fake because you wrote the words that got me there, err. [groan]
596. [defensive] Well, uh, I wrote about your truth using words you couldn't, [passionately], find because the system taught you to hate your own story, you know?
Character 1: Maybe that's true but, um, it still feels like, [exhausted], I'm living someone else's version of my life, you know. [pause]
597. [sincerely] I mean, every achievement since then has been yours and, [confidently], nobody can take that away from you, er. [clearing throat]
Character 1: [withdrawn] The thing that hurts most is that you never, [bored], told me even after we became friends because you kept, [mocking], pretending like I earned everything myself. [cough]
598. [apologetic] Um, I wanted to tell you so many times but, [regretful], watching you finally believe in yourself seemed more important than, well, clearing my conscience. [sniffle]
Character 1: [determined] So, um, what happens now that we both know the truth and, [nervously], can't pretend anymore about how I really got here, you know? [gasp softly]
599. [honest] What happens is you stop letting one essay define, [firmly], your worth when you've proven yourself a hundred times over since, [speeding up], getting that acceptance letter.
Character 1: I need time to figure out if, [confused], I can forgive you or if I even, [very quietly], want to stay at a school I didn't really earn.
600. [sad] Well, um, whatever you decide just remember that, [trembling], the person graduating won't be who I wrote about, err.
Character 1: [softly] Maybe you're right about that but it doesn't, [deeply], change the fact that you took away my chance to fail or, [monotone], succeed on my own terms when it mattered most. [long pause]
601. [tearfully] I know I can't undo what I did but, [desperate], please don't throw away your future just to, [whispering loudly], punish me for trying to help when I should have, [very slowly], just believed you could do it yourself. [cry]
Character 1: [warm] When your brother called me about mediating this, [hesitantly], I wasn't sure if coming here would help, but seeing you now, [concerned], I realize how much you've been carrying alone since the funeral.
602. [very meekly] Everyone just left after the service and I've been, [confused], trying to figure out what Mom and Dad would have wanted, while also, [shaky voice], dealing with all these legal papers and decisions I don't understand. [sigh]
Character 1: [gently] The thing is, your siblings are, [frustrated], struggling with their own guilt about leaving you here, and they don't know how to, [pause], reconnect without feeling like they've failed you.
603. They haven't called or texted in three months, not even to, [bitter], check if I'm eating or sleeping or managing the house payments.
Character 1: [empathetically] Well, um, I've been talking with them separately and, like, they're scared you hate them for, [anxious], moving away when things got hard, but they also, I mean, [regretful], don't know how to bridge this gap that's grown between all of you.
604. [crying while speaking] I just, umm, needed someone to stay, you know, after Mom got sick and Dad started, [whispering], forgetting our names, but everyone had their own lives and careers, and I, well, [trailing off], I was the only one still in high school so—
Character 1: [softly] You became the caretaker by default, and, um, that wasn't fair to you, but, like, [very quietly], your siblings didn't know how to handle watching your parents, [slowly], decline either.
605. So they just, umm, ran away and left me to, well, [monotone], watch them die alone. 
Character 1: [apologetic] Um, I know.
606. [whispered] Well, you don't, really.
Character 1: [firmly] Umm, actually I do.
607. [surprised] Your parents died when you were twenty-three and you had, [angry], already graduated college and started your practice, not stuck in high school watching them, [very sadly], waste away.
Character 1: [sincerely] That's true, but before I became a therapist, [defensive], I spent two years caring for my grandmother with dementia while my own siblings, [jealous], built their perfect lives elsewhere, so I understand the abandonment you're feeling. [deep breath]
608. Then why are you, like, defending them when you know, umm, [exhausted], how much it hurts to be the only one who stayed?
Character 1: [thoughtfully] Because holding onto that anger will eat you alive the way it almost, [passionately], destroyed me before I learned that people handle grief differently, and sometimes, [cheerful], running away is just another form of love that can't bear to watch.
609. [curious] How can abandonment be love when it left me, [upset], dealing with hospice nurses and funeral directors and lawyers while trying to, [quickly], finish my senior year and apply to colleges?
Character 1: [confident] Well, I mean, your brother wire transferred thirty thousand dollars to cover the funeral costs, and, like, your sister, [protective], has been calling me every day since to make sure you're okay, even though she can't, umm, [relieved], bring herself to call you directly because she's terrified of your anger.
610. [stunned] She calls you every day to ask about me but won't just, [sarcastically], pick up the phone and ask me herself?
Character 1: She's convinced you hate her for missing Mom's last words and Dad's final, [trembling], lucid moment when he remembered all your names, and the guilt is, [whispering loudly], paralyzing her ability to reach out.
611. [very sincerely] I recorded those moments on my phone because I knew, well, someday they'd want to hear them, and I've been waiting, like, [hopeful], three months for them to ask. [laugh sadly]
