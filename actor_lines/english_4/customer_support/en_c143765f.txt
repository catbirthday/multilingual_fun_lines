Scenario: complaining about being on hold for over an hour

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So, um, I just—I just waited for like, uh, over an hour? And I'm—I'm really confused because, um, like...

Customer Support: Oh wow, over an hour! I'm so sorry about that wait time, let me just pull up your account here real quick—what's your account number or phone number so I can look into this right away?

Customer: It's, um, it's—wait, so basically my phone is, uh, 555-0142, and like, I really need help because, um, my mom's medications...

Customer Support: Got it, um, 555-0142, perfect, so I'm seeing account ACC-9847-TX here and, uh, I completely understand how frustrating that must be, especially with something as important as medications involved, let me just...

Customer: Wait, did you—did you say 9847? Is that—I don't know if that's right?

Customer Support: Oh! Um, yes so it's showing ACC-9847-TX on my screen here, but, uh, let me double-check—is this for Jennifer Morrison at, um, 482 Oak Street?

Customer: No no no, that's—that's not, um, I'm Sarah, Sarah Chen, and so like, my mom needs her heart medicine and I just—I just don't understand why I was on hold for so...

Customer Support: Oh my goodness, I'm so—let me just, uh, clear this out and start fresh here, Sarah Chen you said? Okay so, um, I'm pulling up—yes here we go, ACC-7263-PM, and I can absolutely see why you're concerned about the wait time, especially with your mom's heart medication!

Customer: Yes! Yes, that's—okay okay, so can you help me?

Customer Support: Absolutely! So, um, looking at your case history here, ticket TKT-45892-A shows, uh, there was a pharmacy order placed three days ago, and, hmm, I'm seeing some notes about...

Customer: Three days? But I—wait, so like, um, I placed it last week? Or was it—no, um, maybe it was three days, I'm so confused, everything's been so, uh, crazy with her hospital visits and...

Customer Support: I hear you, and dealing with hospital visits on top of medication management must be incredibly overwhelming—so in your order confirmation ORD-6621-BC from Tuesday, it shows the prescription was submitted to our pharmacy partner.

Customer: Tuesday, Tuesday, okay so—so basically, um, why was I on hold for, like, it was literally an hour and, uh, twelve minutes, I was timing it because...

Customer Support: An hour and twelve minutes is just, uh, completely unacceptable, and I'm—wow, I'm really sorry about that, um, let me flag this with reference code ESC-9902-HLD so our team can look into why the wait was so long, but right now let's focus on getting your mom's medication sorted out!

Customer: It's just—she needs it by tomorrow, you know? The doctor said—he said it's really important.

Customer Support: Right, right, um, absolutely critical timing here, so, uh, looking at tracking number TRK-880534-MED, I can see—oh wait, hmm, there's a hold on the order...

Customer: A hold? What—what does that mean? I don't—so like, um, is it not coming? Because I just, uh, I really really need this to work out...

Customer Support: No no, don't worry! So what happened is—and this is actually good news—the pharmacy just needs an updated insurance verification, code VER-2145-INS, which I can actually process right now if you have your insurance card handy?

Customer: Oh! Oh okay, um, yes it's—it's right here, so basically the number is, uh, wait, which number do you need? There's like, um, three different numbers on here and I'm...

Customer Support: Perfect! So, um, I just need the member ID, it usually starts with letters and, uh, should be about ten characters long—and hey, once we get this updated with reference RES-3302-PRIORITY, I'm gonna expedite this for overnight delivery, no charge, because of that terrible hold time!
