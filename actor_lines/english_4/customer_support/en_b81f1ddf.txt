Scenario: desperate because they need this resolved before they leave for vacation tomorrow

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, please. I need help. Flight's tomorrow morning and my, uh, my passport renewal still says processing and I just...

Customer Support: Oh geez, so, um, passport renewals, yeah those are—like, honestly our system for tracking those is, uh, basically terrible, I'm so sorry. Let me, um, pull up your application, what's your confirmation number?

Customer: PSP-4429-QN. Can't leave without it. Kids are packed. Everything's...

Customer Support: Okay so PSP-4429-QN, umm, alright so basically what I'm seeing here is, uh, it actually cleared yesterday but—and this is so typical—nobody, like, updated the website tracking.

Customer: Wait. It cleared? You have it?

Customer Support: So yeah, um, it's showing completed as of, uh, 4:47 PM yesterday, tracking number TRK-88290-LP, but like, our notification system has been, um, totally broken all week so you wouldn't have known.

Customer: I've been calling. Three days. Nobody could tell me anything...

Customer Support: I know, it's, um, it's honestly ridiculous how bad our phone system is, like, half the reps can't even access the, uh, the expedited passport database, reference code REF-55812-XP, which is probably why nobody could help you.

Customer: Um, so where, uh, where is it? Can I get it today? I'm literally, um, begging here.

Customer Support: Right right, so, um, good news is it's at our, uh, distribution center, facility code FAC-2201-B, and, like, technically I'm not supposed to say this but, um, you can absolutely pick it up today before 6 PM.

Customer: Do you know who I've been dealing with? Regional manager. Thompson. Three days of this...

Customer Support: So, um, here's what we're gonna do, okay? I'm putting in a, uh, priority pickup order, confirmation PUP-90134-RT, and, um, basically when you get there just, like, mention my operator ID, that's OPR-7765.

Customer: What if they say no? What if it's not...

Customer Support: Yeah so, um, they won't say no because I'm, uh, basically putting a manager override in the system right now, code MGR-4451-VS, and, like, between you and me? This happens, um, all the time with vacation travel.

Customer: Um, you're saving my life. I mean, uh, literally saving...

Customer Support: No no, I totally get it, like, I had the same thing happen with my, um, my daughter's passport last year, so, uh, now let me just make sure you have everything you need, okay?

Customer: I'll be there. Hour. Do I need the confirmation...

Customer Support: So bring your ID and, um, this pickup code I'm giving you, it's, uh, PUP-90134-RT, and also, like, just to be safe, your original application number PSP-4429-QN, and, um, ask for the expedited desk.

Customer: Expedited desk. Got it. If this doesn't work I'm calling Thompson directly...

Customer Support: It'll work, I promise, so I'm, um, also sending you an email right now with, uh, everything documented, case number CSE-111290-DP, and, like, my direct extension 4486 just in case, but, um, you should be totally fine.
