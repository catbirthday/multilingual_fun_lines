Scenario: substitute teacher, confused about which payroll system she should contact about missing wages

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, so I'm trying to figure out... hmm, which payroll system I'm supposed to, uh, contact about my missing wages?

Customer Support: Okay so. Let me just. Pull up your info here. Um, can I get your employee ID? Should start with SUB or maybe TMP.

Customer: I think it's... wait, let me see here... SUB-4782? Or maybe that's my, um, district badge number?

Customer Support: Right right. So SUB-4782. Hmm, that's actually. Let me check. Are you with, uh, the main district payroll or the, um, third-party system? SmartSub maybe? Or um, Frontline?

Customer: That's what I'm trying to figure out! The last person said SmartSub but, uh, they couldn't find me either.

Customer Support: Okay okay. So um, let's back up here. When you first. Got hired. Did they give you, uh, any paperwork with like a system code? Would be something like FSS-2024 or DPS-something?

Customer: Um, I mean, I got so many papers... probably? I don't, uh, I don't really know what to look for.

Customer Support: No no that's. That's fine. Um, so here's what I'm seeing. Your ID SUB-4782 is showing in, uh, two systems actually? Which is. Hmm. Not supposed to happen.

Customer: Two systems? So maybe that's why I haven't been, um, paid in like... it's been three weeks now?

Customer Support: Three weeks? Oh. Oh that's. Um, okay so let me escalate. Your case number is gonna be PAY-88291-MK. And uh, this is definitely. Not right.

Customer: I mean, I've got bills and, um, my daughter needs her medication next week, so I kind of need this sorted...

Customer Support: Absolutely. I get it. So um, what I'm doing now. I'm flagging this as urgent. Reference code URG-1127-P. And uh, let me see which system actually. Has your hours logged.

Customer: Um, okay so... hmm, what if neither one has them? Because I've been, uh, I've been working, definitely.

Customer Support: Right so. The main district system. Shows you active but. No hours. And SmartSub has um, has hours logged but. Your status is. Pending? Since October apparently.

Customer: October?! But I started in, um, in November... that doesn't even... how does that make sense?

Customer Support: Yeah that's. Um. That's weird. Let me. Hmm. Okay so your onboarding date in file ONB-9847-XX says November fifteenth. But SmartSub thinks you started October second?

Customer: I mean, maybe someone else has my, uh, my ID or something? I don't know, I'm just... this is really frustrating.

Customer Support: No I totally. I get it. So um, here's what we're gonna do. I'm merging both records. Under case MRG-4455-TN. And uh, routing this directly to. Payroll supervisor.

Customer: Um, okay but like... is this actually going to fix it? Or am I gonna have to, uh, call back again next week?

Customer Support: So I'm putting a. Seven-two hour flag. On this. Which means um, someone has to respond by Thursday. Code PRI-7209. And I'm also. Gonna email you directly. With the supervisor's extension. Just in case.
