Scenario: ultrasound tech, confused about a duplicate charge for online training materials

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, so I just—wait, let me start over—I'm seeing, uh, two charges for the same... what's it called... certification course?

Customer Support: Right. Let me. Pull that up. Account number?

Customer: It's, um... oh god, where did I... ummm, hold on, I think it's—no wait—let me check my email.

Customer Support: No rush. Take your time. I'm here.

Customer: Okay so, uh, I found it but like, this is really—I mean, um, I can't afford two payments, especially with my hours getting cut.

Customer Support: Listen. We're fixing this. Today. What's that account number—I'm gonna, um, sort of... escalate this right to... what's the word... billing override.

Customer: Really? Um, it's 4-4-7... no wait, sorry, that's my—let me... 4-5-7-2-9.

Customer Support: Got it. Account 45729. Pulling up. Transaction ID is, um, TXN-88234-QM for the first charge. Second one's TXN-88291-QM. Same amount?

Customer: Yeah, both three hundred... wait, is this going to affect my—I mean, the course starts Monday and if I lose access...

Customer Support: No. Absolutely not. Not happening.

Customer: But what if the—sorry, I'm just, um, really stressed because, uh, my supervisor needs proof of enrollment by tomorrow.

Customer Support: Enrollment stays. Active. I'm issuing refund code RFD-2391-XX right now. But, um, here's the thing—and I'm kind of, sorry, this is awkward—the system needs... hmm... twenty-four hours to process.

Customer: Twenty-four hours? So, umm, that means I won't see it until, uh, what... Thursday? Friday?

Customer Support: Wednesday. Latest. Probably Tuesday.

Customer: Wait, really? That's actually... I thought it would take like, um, weeks or something.

Customer Support: Nope. And, um, I'm also applying credit CRD-7823-MP. That's instant. Shows immediately. Should, uh, kind of help with the... you know, the cash flow thing you mentioned.

Customer: Oh my god, um, I didn't expect—wow, uh, this is so much better than I thought!

Customer Support: Good. That's. How it should be. Confirmation email coming. Reference number REF-99234-UTM for your records.

Customer: I'm actually—sorry, I'm like, ummm, kind of laughing because I was so panicked and, uh, you just made my whole week!

Customer Support: Hey. That's the job. Got everything? All set?
