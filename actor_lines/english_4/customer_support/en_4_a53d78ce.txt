=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm calling back about case number—case number C-7829. *sharp inhale* Everything arrived.

Customer Support: Oh wow okay great so let me pull that up real quick C-7829-MK4 yeah I see it here express shipping upgrade from Tuesday and um looks like delivery was confirmed at 9:47 this morning perfect timing right before that event you mentioned

Customer: Yes. It's... what's the word... unexpected. That it actually worked.

Customer Support: Hah yeah no I totally get that honestly but hey that's what we're here for and uh lemme just update your account real quick with the positive feedback code POS-4421 so management sees this worked out

Customer: The last three times, they said—they said the same thing. *exhale* But this time. Different.

Customer Support: Mmm yeah I can see your history here actually wow three incidents in two months that's rough but look this time we flagged your account VIP-STATUS-7793 so basically future orders get priority handling no more issues fingers crossed

Customer: I suppose I should... *searching* express gratitude. That's what one does.

Customer Support: Aww no hey seriously you don't need to be all formal or anything I'm just glad it worked out and er between you and me your case got escalated to director level DIR-0982 which is why it actually got fixed this time

Customer: Director level. *sharp inhale* So that's what it takes.

Customer Support: Right right unfortunately yeah sometimes it takes that push but hmm good news is your account's now coded PREM-8827-XX so you've got my direct line 1-800-451-9982 if anything goes sideways again which hopefully it won't

Customer: I'll keep that number. Just in case. One never—never knows.

Customer Support: Smart thinking and oh actually while I've got you lemme apply credit code CREDIT-5579-TY to your account that's fifty bucks for the hassle even though everything worked out because frankly three strikes is two too many you know

Customer: Fifty dollars. *exhale* That's... surprisingly adequate.

Customer Support: Heh adequate I'll take it and uh just so you know reference number REF-20241127-KM is on your account now so if you need to call back whoever answers will see the whole story immediately no explaining required

Customer: No explaining. Good. I'm tired of—of repeating myself constantly.

Customer Support: Totally understand that and ooh wait I'm seeing here that loyalty department left note LOY-4492 they want to upgrade you to platinum tier which means free two-day shipping forever basically so that should help prevent future drama

Customer: Platinum tier. *inhale* After all that. How... what's the word... ironic.

Customer Support: Yeah funny how that works right but hey silver lining at least and er your new member ID PLAT-7799-JKL is active immediately so next time you order it'll automatically apply the shipping upgrade

Customer: I appreciate the efficiency. This time. *exhale* Genuinely.

Customer Support: Aww thanks that means a lot actually and hey before you go just remember that direct line 1-800-451-9982 ext 4421 is specifically for priority support so you skip the queue completely okay take care now
