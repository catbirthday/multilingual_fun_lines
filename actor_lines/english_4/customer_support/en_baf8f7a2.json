So what's happening here with report TRP-6633-AA is, um, your tips are being calculated as a percentage of the servers' sales, not their actual tips."

            "content": "Hmm, well it gets a bit complicated. Let me, um, let me explain it like this... so your tip-share formula, which is listed here as TSF-0923, it's set at, uh, 2.5% of total sales, but sometimes servers report less tips than they actually made, you know?"

            "content": "No no, I wouldn't, um, I wouldn't say that exactly, but I get why it feels that way! Let me see here... hmm, what if we looked at your actual tip distributions? So document DOC-7741-RV9 shows you should've gotten, uh, $127.50 last week but you only received $94."

            "role": "Customer Support",

So what I can do is, uh, file a formal review under case number CAS-9901-XM2 and, hmm, that triggers an audit of all tip distributions for your location."

The audit team takes this seriously and, uh, if they find discrepancies, which based on what I'm seeing in log LOG-5567-PP they probably will, you'll get, hmm, retroactive payment plus your location has to, um, fix their reporting process. Takes about two weeks but, uh, you'll get every penny you're owed."
