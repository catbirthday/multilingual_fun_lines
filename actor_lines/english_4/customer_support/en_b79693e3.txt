Scenario: fishmonger, calling early about a refrigeration equipment warranty claim before product arrives

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, so I'm probably, uh, calling too early here but... hmm, let me see... I ordered a, um, refrigeration unit?

Customer Support: Oh hi there! No no, you're—actually wait—you're not too early at all. Let me just—um, let me pull up your account here. Can you give me your order number or, uh, maybe the email you used?

Customer: Oh god, I'm so stupid, um... let me find that... hmm, okay so...

Customer Support: Hey, it's totally fine, really. Take your time. While you're looking—I mean—most folks don't even know they should, um, register for warranty beforehand, so you're actually ahead of the game here.

Customer: Found it! Ummm, order... wait, is this right? Um, THX-4429-BK?

Customer Support: Perfect! So that's—hmm—okay I see it here, THX-4429-BK, that's the, uh, commercial freezer unit, right? The CompactChill 3000? And it looks like—wait let me just—yeah, scheduled for delivery tomorrow morning.

Customer: Yeah, um, so here's the thing... hmm, what if something's wrong with it when it arrives?

Customer Support: Oh, you don't—I mean—you don't need to worry about that at all. So the warranty code, um, WRN-88256-QJ, that's already active from purchase date. But let me just—actually—are you concerned about something specific?

Customer: I just, um... okay so... I run a small fish market and, uh, if this thing breaks...

Customer Support: Ohhh, I get it. Yeah, fish market—that's—wow, refrigeration's critical for you. Um, so here's what we can do—I'm gonna flag your account with priority status code PRI-7734-X right now.

Customer: Um, wait, you can do that? I mean, I'm probably worrying over nothing here...

Customer Support: No no no, you're being smart. Really. So with that priority code, if—and I mean if—anything goes wrong, we get a tech out same day. Not next day. Same day. That's, um, that's gonna be linked to your warranty WRN-88256-QJ.

Customer: Oh wow, that's... hmm, let me think... um, what if it's like, damaged during delivery?

Customer Support: So that's—okay that's actually—let me check something. Hmm. Yeah, so delivery damage is covered under transit protection code TPC-9901-M, which is, um, already on your order. The driver'll do an inspection with you before they leave.

Customer: I'm sorry, I'm being, uh, such a pain about this... it's just, um, my dad started this shop and...

Customer Support: Oh hey, no—you're not—this is important! Family business, that's—wow. Um, you know what? Let me also add our extended care package ECP-2245-RT, no charge. That covers, uh, power surge damage, which—for commercial freezers—that's huge.

Customer: Really? Um, that's so... hmm, okay so that means if we lose power and it surges back...?

Customer Support: Exactly! You got it. So between your warranty WRN-88256-QJ, the priority code, and now the surge protection—you're basically—I mean—you're covered for everything. Even, um, even compressor issues for five years.

Customer: Um, thank you so much, I just... hmm... I've been losing sleep over this, you know?

Customer Support: That's—I mean—running a fish market? That's tough. But listen, you've got my direct extension now, it's showing in your account notes as EXT-4556. Any concerns tomorrow during delivery, you just—you call me directly, okay? We'll get you sorted. Promise.
