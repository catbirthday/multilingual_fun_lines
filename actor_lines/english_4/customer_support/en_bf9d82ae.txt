Scenario: trying to understand automatic price adjustments

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, so I got this... uh... charge. And it's, um, different? Than what I... er... expected.

Customer Support: Oh! Okay so, um, let me just—hmm, let me pull up your account here and, uh, I can definitely help you figure out what's—er, what happened there. What's your account number or, um, order number if you have it?

Customer: I think it's... wait, no... ACC-5982-M.

Customer Support: Perfect! ACC-5982-M, got it, and I'm, um, seeing here—oh! This is interesting, so you've got, uh, automatic price adjustments enabled and it looks like—hmm, let me just... okay so there was a price match on October 12th.

Customer: Price match? I don't... I didn't ask for that.

Customer Support: Right right, so, um, here's what happened—and this is actually, uh, really cool—our system automatically, er, checks for lower prices and if we find one, um, we adjust it for you.

Customer: But I... um... I just... I don't, uh, understand why it's... er... different amounts every time.

Customer Support: Oh! I see what's confusing here—so let me explain—no wait, let me show you the breakdown. Your original charge was $89.99, reference REF-2024-8847, but then we found it for $76.49 elsewhere.

Customer: So you just... um... change it? Without, uh, telling me?

Customer Support: Well, so there should've been—sorry, I mean you should've gotten an email. Let me see here... notification sent to your address on file October 12th, tracking number NTF-88492-PQ.

Customer: I'm just... I can't... um... I get so many emails and, uh, I probably... er... missed it.

Customer Support: Totally get that! Happens all the time, trust me.

Customer: Can I just, um, turn this off? The automatic... uh... thing? It's, er, too much to track.

Customer Support: Absolutely! Let me just—so in your account settings, section APS-7, I can disable that right now. Should I go ahead and turn off automatic price adjustments?

Customer: Yes. Please. Just... make it stop.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, I'm disabling it now and—hmm, let me make sure—yep! It's off, and, uh, you'll get a confirmation email with code CNF-9982-LM, um, just so you have that for your records.

Customer: And no more... changes? To prices?

Customer Support: Right, exactly! So, um, from now on, whatever price you see at checkout, that's, uh, that's what you'll be charged. No more, er, automatic adjustments or—yeah, it'll stay the same.

Customer: Good. That's... that's all I wanted.

Customer Support: Perfect! Oh, and just so you know—if you ever want to turn it back on, reference code RAP-6621-V in your account settings. But for now, you're all set with fixed pricing!
