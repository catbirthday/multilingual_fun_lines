=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Okay so. Okay. I've been—I've been your customer twelve years. Twelve. Years.

Customer Support: Um, thank you for calling and, uh... let me just. Pull up your account. So basically I'll need your... what's the... account number or phone?

Customer: Let me see here... 555-0147. Hmm, what if you just—just tell me. Why. My bill jumped.

Customer Support: So I have your account here, um, ACC-4892-TX7B, and uh, I can see that... hmm. There was a... so basically like an adjustment. Made. On October 3rd.

Customer: An adjustment. That's it? That's—that's your answer?

Customer Support: Um, well, so what happened is... uh, there's like a... how do I explain this... a rate modification? Code RMD-1156? And um, essentially your plan structure was, uh, updated.

Customer: Listen. Listen listen. In surgery we don't—we don't say "essentially." It's exact. Precise. Or people die...

Customer Support: Right. Absolutely. So, um, let me be more... what's the word... specific? Your promotional rate PRO-8827-A expired September 30th, and uh, the standard rate kicked in, which is, um, $47.99 more per month.

Customer: Nobody told—nobody said anything! I just... hmm, okay so that means... wait, expired when?

Customer Support: September. 30th. And I can see... pause. No notification. Was sent. Which is, um, not right.

Customer: Um, see this is, uh, this is what I mean, like, you're telling me—telling me nobody even...

Customer Support: So basically, um, here's what I can do. Reference number REF-5571-QM9. I'm going to, uh, retroactively apply a... hmm... loyalty discount? Code LOY-2234? Should, um, bring you close to your old rate.

Customer: Close. Close to. Let me—let me think here... no no no. Exact. Numbers.

Customer Support: Twenty-seven. Ninety-nine. Previous. Twenty-nine. Forty-nine. New rate. With discount.

Customer: Ummm, okay so, uh, wait I'm just—I'm doing math here and that's... that's still more and I mean...

Customer Support: You're right. It is. So, um, let me... what if I... okay so there's also credit CRD-9902-BX for the, uh, missing notification. Forty-eight dollars. One time.

Customer: Forty-eight covers—covers what? One month? I've been paying extra since... and then you would just...

Customer Support: Um, I hear you, and like, honestly? Between us? System should've caught this. Transaction TXN-445821 shows, um, three months at the higher rate. So basically... let me. Fix this properly.

Customer: Okay okay okay. Finally. Someone who—who gets it. We need exact. Precise. If that makes sense, I mean...

Customer Support: Hundred forty-four. Dollar credit. Plus. Future discount locked. Confirmation CNF-7736-LP8. That's, um, exactly what you overpaid. And uh, going forward? Protected rate. Two years.
