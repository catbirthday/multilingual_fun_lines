Scenario: private chef, dealing with a wealthy client who filed a credit card dispute against her

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I need to discuss a... what's the word... a chargeback. Filed against me.

Customer Support: Alright so—let me just—I can definitely help you with that today, um, could I get your merchant account number to pull up the details?

Customer: MER-7294. Private chef services.

Customer Support: Perfect, um, so I'm seeing account MER-7294-PC here and, uh, there's a dispute filed yesterday for, hmm, let me see... transaction TXN-829461-QV for three thousand eight hundred dollars, is that the one we're looking at?

Customer: So basically, um, this client—she ate the entire dinner. Five courses. Then files this.

Customer Support: I understand—no wait, let me—okay so I can see here that the dispute reason code is RRC-03, which is, um, "services not as described" and unfortunately that's one where we need documentation from your side.

Customer: How do I know you're not just... protecting them? The wealthy ones?

Customer Support: So, um, I get why you'd think that but, uh, actually the process is pretty standard regardless of the amount, and, hmm, what I can do is walk you through exactly what evidence packet EPK-7294-01 needs to include.

Customer: Evidence. For food. That's been eaten.

Customer Support: Right so—actually let me—the thing is, um, for catering disputes we typically need, uh, signed contracts, photos if you have them, and any communication with the client, reference number DOC-SET-94A covers all that.

Customer: Um, so like, I have texts where she's, uh, praising everything. During the dinner.

Customer Support: That's perfect actually, those text messages can be uploaded to case file CSE-829461-A, and, um, if she's specifically mentioning satisfaction with the service, that's really strong evidence.

Customer: She said "divine." Her word. Divine.

Customer Support: Excellent, so—wait actually—make sure when you submit those through portal link PTL-7294.disputes.com, um, you include timestamps and, uh, the full conversation thread, not just selected messages.

Customer: So basically what you're, um, telling me is... I have to prove I cooked food. That she ate.

Customer Support: I know it's—look, I've seen these before and, um, with proper documentation, especially those texts, dispute reversal rate is about, uh, seventy-eight percent in code RRV-78-FOOD cases like yours.

Customer: Seventy-eight. So one in four, I just... lose. Despite doing everything right.

Customer Support: Unfortunately that's—I mean—the bank makes final call on case ARB-829461, but, um, what I can do is flag this for expedited review, should have an initial response within, uh, three business days instead of the usual seven.

Customer: Um, how do I know that's actually, like, expedited? Or just... what you tell everyone?

Customer Support: So your expedite code is EXP-7294-11A and, um, you'll get an automated email from notify@disputes-MER.com confirming that status, uh, usually within the next hour, and that's system-generated, not something I control.
