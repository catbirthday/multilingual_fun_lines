=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Great. Still charging me. For equipment I returned. Two months ago.

Customer Support: Oh! Okay so, um... equipment return, let me—I can definitely help with that! Just need to pull up your account real quick here. What's your... hmm... account number? Or phone number works too!

Customer: Sure. 415-7829. The—no wait—sorry, that's old. It's 415-782-9044.

Customer Support: Got it got it! Okay. Pulling that up now. And... there we go! Account #WW-48291-K. I see you're... uh... William's Window Washing? Is that—yeah that's right?

Customer: Yep. That's me. Returned the harness. October third. Still getting billed.

Customer Support: Right right. So I'm seeing the... what's it called... the ProClimb harness system? Model PCH-750? Shows here it's... hmm. Still marked as active rental. But you said October third?

Customer: October third. Dropped it off. Got a receipt. Somewhere.

Customer Support: Oh perfect! Receipt's great. So the thing is—er, let me check the return log here. October third... October third... I'm not—wait. Hold on. There's something. Huh. Shows a return attempt? But it's... incomplete?

Customer: Incomplete? What does—no wait—how is returning something incomplete?

Customer Support: Yeah so. This is interesting actually! Looks like the return got started at our Riverside location—2847 Riverside Drive? But the system shows... uh... "pending inspection status" since 10/03. Which means—oh! I think I know what happened!

Customer: They lost it. Of course they lost it. This is—I can't—do you know how much—

Customer Support: No no! Not lost. So basically—er, what happens is... sometimes equipment needs safety inspection? Before we can process the return? And yours got... hmm... stuck. In the queue. Which shouldn't happen but—

Customer: Stuck. In a queue. For two months. While billing me.

Customer Support: I know. That's. Yeah that's not okay. Let me—actually I can fix this! Reference number RTN-10034-B7. I'm marking it as... there. Inspection waived. Manager override. Code 7750.

Customer: Just like that? You can—wait really? That's it?

Customer Support: Yep! Well. Almost. Need to backdate the return to... October third. And then... calculating refund. So you'll get $847.92 credited back? Should hit your account in... uh... 3-5 business days?

Customer: Eight forty seven. Okay. That's—yeah that sounds right actually. Thank god.

Customer Support: Oh! And I'm adding a note. Case #CS-99412. So if there's any—I mean there won't be—but if anything comes up? Reference that. My badge number's 4485. Ask for Marcus.

Customer: Marcus. Badge 4485. Got it. Thanks. Seriously. This was—yeah. Thanks.

Customer Support: Absolutely! Happy to help. And, um... sorry about the wait. On the inspection thing. Two months is. Yeah. Anyway! All set now. Refund's processing. Confirmation going to your email at wwindow@gmail.com!
