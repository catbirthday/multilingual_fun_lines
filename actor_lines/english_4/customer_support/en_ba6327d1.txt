=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, sorry, I'm just, uh, really confused here, got charged twice for the, um, what's it called... the CEU training thing?

Customer Support: Mmm. Let me, um... pull that up. Account?

Customer: Yeah it's, uh, sorry, lemme find it... ACC-4428-N I think?

Customer Support: Got it, so um, I'm seeing account ACC-4428-NV here and, er, let me just... okay there's the training materials, uh, looking at the charges now... hmm... give me just a sec to dig into this.

Customer: Sorry I just, um, I shoulda checked better but saw two charges, same amount.

Customer Support: No no, totally fine, so um, I see what you're... wait, no that's... sorry, let me check the other—actually yeah, there's two charges here, both for $89.99, transaction IDs TRX-8827-ML and TRX-8827-MK.

Customer: Right! See? Um, that's what I mean, and like, I only bought one course!

Customer Support: Checking the, uh... the timestamps here...

Customer: I mean I've been buying from you guys for, um, three years now, never had this happen.

Customer Support: So these are, um, both from yesterday at... that's 2:14 PM and then, er, 2:16 PM, so like really close together, which usually means, uh, hmm, sometimes the system does this thing where...

Customer: Wait so um, did I click twice? God I'm such an idiot if I—

Customer Support: Actually no, um, looking at the logs here, reference REF-2024-77821, it shows just one, er, one click-through but the payment processor, uh, it pinged twice.

Customer: Oh! So not my fault? Sorry I just, um, felt so stupid calling about this.

Customer Support: Definitely not you, so um, what I'm gonna do is, er, process a refund for that duplicate, should I use the card ending in, uh, let me confirm... 4429?

Customer: Um yeah that's, that's right, the Visa one.

Customer Support: Perfect. Got it.

Customer: How long til I, um, til I see it back?

Customer Support: So the refund request RFD-9987-QZ2 is, um, processing now and typically it's, er, three to five business days but sometimes, uh, sometimes faster depending on your bank.

Customer: Okay good, sorry again for the, um, the hassle, just needed my money back.

Customer Support: No hassle at all, so um, you should get an email confirmation in about, er, five minutes with all the details, reference number REF-2024-77822, and uh, is there anything else I can help you with today?
