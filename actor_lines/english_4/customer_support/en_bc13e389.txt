Scenario: construction worker, embarrassed because he doesn't understand the insurance claim form

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, yeah, I got this... uh... claim form. Thing is, I can't... er...

Customer Support: Oh absolutely, so I can definitely help you with that claim form today, let me just pull up your account here real quick, could you give me your policy number?

Customer: It's, um... P-four... no wait, uh, PD4... 5512?

Customer Support: Perfect, so that's PD4-5512, and hmm, let me see here... okay so I've got your account pulled up and I can see you've got the construction liability policy, is this about a recent incident?

Customer: Yeah. Accident last week. But this form's just...

Customer Support: Right right, so basically these claim forms can be pretty overwhelming, I mean, even I had trouble with mine when I had to file one last year, so let's just take this step by step, what section are you stuck on?

Customer: Um, all of it? Er, I mean... section three's where I just... uh...

Customer Support: Okay so section three is the incident details, and like, that's actually one of the trickiest parts, so what we need there is basically the date, time, and a description of what happened.

Customer: I know what happened. Can't figure how they want it... you know?

Customer Support: Oh totally, so they want it in like this really specific format which is, um, honestly kind of ridiculous, but basically start with the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, then the approximate time, and then just describe it simply.

Customer: Um, simple? They got, uh, six boxes asking about... er... "contributing factors" and...

Customer Support: Yeah so those contributing factor boxes are, hmm, let me think... okay so basically you only fill those if there were things like weather conditions, equipment issues, third party involvement, that kind of thing.

Customer: Equipment broke. That count? Or is that... I mean, uh...

Customer Support: Absolutely that counts, so you'd put that in box 3B under equipment malfunction, and then there's a code, um, let me find it... EQF-7721 for mechanical failure, just write that in there.

Customer: Er, wait, um... EQ... uh, what? Sorry, I'm not... this stuff isn't...

Customer Support: No no, you're totally fine, so it's EQF-7721, and honestly, you know what, I'm just gonna note all this in your file CLM-20241-BK so if you need to call back, anyone can see exactly where we left off.

Customer: Um, look, I just... uh... I need this done. Boss needs it Monday and I'm...
