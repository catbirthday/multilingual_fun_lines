Scenario: karaoke host, multiple part-time gigs making tax withholding on each one complicated

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So I'm I'm calling about taxes. Multiple jobs. It's it's a mess.

Customer Support: Oh I completely understand, um, the whole multiple income stream thing is... what's the word... like a nightmare with withholding, let me just pull up your account here with your SSN ending in?

Customer: 4-7-2-9. Of course. Nothing's ever simple.

Customer Support: Got it, so I'm seeing here, um, account ID ACC-9284-TJ62, and wow you've got, uh, let me count... six different W-4s on file? That's... yeah the system really isn't built for this kind of thing.

Customer: Six. Yeah. Karaoke host. DJ. Bartender. It's it's all just... whatever pays.

Customer Support: I hear you, I really do, and honestly? The way they calculate withholding across multiple... um, what's the term... concurrent employers? It's basically designed to fail, so let me check your withholding status on form WH-8834-K here.

Customer: Designed to fail. Right. That's that's exactly it.

Customer Support: So, um, looking at your records here, uh, the issue is that each employer is, like, withholding as if they're your only job, which means... hmm, let me calculate this... yeah you're gonna owe about three thousand come April.

Customer: Three three thousand? I don't... I mean I'm sorry, I just... of course.

Customer Support: No no, don't apologize, this is, um, genuinely frustrating and I'm... what's the right way to say this... I'm angry FOR you because the system should flag this automatically.

Customer: Um, so like, is there any way to, uh, fix this or am I just, um, completely screwed here?

Customer Support: Okay so, um, let me think... we can file an amended W-4, form number AMW-7763-P91, for your highest paying gig and then... hmm... adjust the others to withhold extra.

Customer: Highest paying. Ha. They're they're all terrible.

Customer Support: I get it, I really do, and um, looking at your income breakdown in report RPT-5582-XN, the karaoke hosting is actually... uh, marginally the highest at twelve-fifty an hour, so we could start there?

Customer: Twelve-fifty. God. I'm I'm sorry, this is just... embarrassing.

Customer Support: Please don't be embarrassed, seriously, like half the people I talk to are... what's the phrase... piecing together multiple gigs just to get by, it's the economy not you.

Customer: Um, okay so, uh, what do I need to, um, actually do here to not owe thousands?

Customer Support: Right right, so, um, I'm submitting request REQ-9901-LK44 to increase withholding by, uh, let me see... eighty-seven dollars per paycheck on your main gig, and then... hmm... twenty on each of the others?

Customer: Eighty-seven. Per check. Great. That's that's rent money.

Customer Support: I know, I'm so sorry, it's... look, the alternative is, um, we could set up quarterly estimated payments under plan QEP-4428-D, which might be... what's the word... less painful spread out?
