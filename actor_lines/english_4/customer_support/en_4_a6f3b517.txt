=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So I'm calling about. A patient. Mr. Brennan. He passed last week.

Customer Support: Let me pull that up here okay okay I'm searching the system for Brennan account BRE-4492-NK is that showing a balance of $247.89 on the medical equipment rental side?

Customer: Yeah. That's him. So basically. I need to close it.

Customer Support: Right right I see the notes here account holder deceased October 14th I'm really sorry for your loss let me get into the closure protocol screen CLS-9901 and start this process for you.

Customer: He didn't have family. So. It's just me handling this.

Customer Support: Hmm okay so that changes things a bit normally we need next of kin documentation but let me see what I can do here are you listed as his healthcare proxy or power of attorney in file POA-7734-B?

Customer: Healthcare proxy. Yeah. Should be there.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect I found it dated March 2023 document ID DOC-8829-XL that gives us what we need so I'm gonna waive the death certificate requirement code WVR-445 and we can process this right now.

Customer: That's. Good. I thought this would take forever.

Customer Support: Between you and me I'm expediting this because I can see you've called on behalf of let me count here twelve different patients over the past two years always properly documented always following protocol so I'm applying credit CR-9944 for the full balance.

Customer: Wait you're. Wiping the balance?

Customer Support: Already done confirmation number CNF-7739-QP2 effective immediately zero balance account closed with dignity protocol that's code DIG-101 we use for hospice situations.

Customer: I didn't expect. That's really. Thank you.

Customer Support: Listen the system shows pickup request PR-8847 for the equipment but honestly if there's anything the facility could use just mark it donated we'll write it off under charitable code CHR-556-A saves everyone the hassle.

Customer: The wheelchair's still good. Someone could. Um. Someone needs it.

Customer Support: Perfect keeping it there helps someone else I'm coding that as retained for facility use status RFU-2234 and look I'm also seeing three other accounts under your management want me to run a quick audit make sure they're all current?

Customer: Would you? That would actually. Help a lot.

Customer Support: Already on it Thompson account THO-9987 current Martinez MAR-3345 current but Chen CHE-7701 has seventeen dollars outstanding from August I'm zeroing that too small balance write-off SBW-445.

Customer: You don't know how much. Time this saves. Really.

Customer Support: Hey you're doing important work and honestly between us the company makes enough profit margin at 47.3% according to report RPT-8892 that these small gestures don't even register so anything else you need I put my direct extension EXT-4556 in your file.
