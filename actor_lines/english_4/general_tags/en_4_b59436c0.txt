Scenario: A rising young model meets the legendary photographer who captured her late mother's only professional portraits thirty years ago, just before her first major runway show.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You're Marcus Chen, aren't you? The one who photographed my mother back in '94 when she was just starting out, before everything fell apart for her.

Character 2: [recognition dawning] My God, you have her eyes exactly—Sophia's daughter. I heard you were walking tonight but I didn't make the connection until just now seeing you here.

Character 1: Those portraits you took, they're the only professional photos we have of her looking truly happy, before the industry broke her down completely.

Character 2: She was luminous that day, talking about her dreams and how she was going to change everything about how models were treated. [wistful] Twenty-two years old and absolutely fearless.

Character 1: I've studied every single frame you shot, trying to understand who she was before she became the cautionary tale everyone whispers about backstage.

Character 2: [gently] You're nervous about tonight, walking for Versace. I can see it in how you're holding your shoulders, same way she did before her first big show.

Character 1: [voice trembling] Everyone keeps telling me I look just like her, move like her, and I'm terrified I'll end up like her too—another beautiful disaster they'll gossip about.

Character 2: [firmly] You're not her.

Character 1: But the pressure is already crushing me and I haven't even stepped onto the runway yet. [shaky exhale] How did she handle it at first?

Character 2: [thoughtfully] She didn't handle it—she danced with it, made the pressure part of her performance until it became too much and she forgot how to stop performing.

Character 1: Sometimes I feel her watching me, especially tonight, like she's trying to tell me something important but I can't quite hear it. [quieter] Is that crazy?

Character 2: Not at all.

Character 1: The show starts in forty minutes and I'm standing here talking to a stranger about my dead mother instead of getting ready. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [warmly] I'm not a stranger—I'm probably the only person here who knew her before fame touched her, when she was just Sophia who loved strawberry milkshakes and collected vintage postcards.

Character 1: She collected postcards? [voice catching] I have boxes of them but never knew where they came from or why she kept them all.

Character 2: From every city she dreamed of visiting before modeling took her there for work—she wanted to see them as a person, not a product.

Character 1: [building strength] Then that's what I'll remember tonight when I walk—that she was a person first, not just a beautiful tragedy, and so am I.

Character 2: Perfect.

Character 1: [determined whisper] Will you stay?

Character 2: [moved] I've been photographing fashion for thirty-seven years, seen a thousand girls walk a thousand runways, but yes—for Sophia's daughter, I'll stay.
