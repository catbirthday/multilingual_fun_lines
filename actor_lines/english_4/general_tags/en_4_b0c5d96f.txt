Scenario: A forum moderator meets with a security system technician who has evidence that the online harassment she's been dealing with has escalated to physical stalking of her home address.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: When you called and said you had security footage from my neighborhood, I thought maybe it was just paranoid thinking on my part, but seeing you here with actual evidence makes this terrifyingly real.

Character 2: [measured] The camera system I installed three houses down from yours caught someone photographing your home at 3 AM last Tuesday, and then again Thursday, same vehicle, license plate matches a rental. [pause] This isn't random.

Character 1: [voice catching] That's the same night someone posted those photos of my car in the forum with the message about knowing where I sleep at night.

Character 2: [grimly] I cross-referenced the timestamps, and yeah, the posts went up exactly forty-three minutes after they left your street, which means they're documenting everything in real-time.

Character 1: I've been moderating that conspiracy theory forum for three years, and sure, I've banned hundreds of users for threats, but this one, [exhales shakily], DarkPatriot99, they're different, methodical.

Character 2: The way they disabled your porch light without triggering your home security suggests technical knowledge, probably military or law enforcement training based on the approach pattern I'm seeing. [clears throat]

Character 1: [trembling] Every time I ban one of their accounts, they come back angrier, posting my old addresses, my mother's maiden name, even screenshots of my college yearbook photos.

Character 2: [leaning forward] Listen, I've upgraded security for judges and witnesses in protection, and what we're looking at here requires immediate action, not just digital but physical countermeasures. [determined]

Character 1: [desperately] Can you help me understand what I'm actually dealing with here, because the police just keep saying to document everything but they won't do anything until something actually happens?

Character 2: What you're dealing with is someone who's escalating from digital to physical stalking, and in my experience, [sighs], that acceleration timeline is usually about two weeks before attempted contact.

Character 1: [barely breathing] Two weeks?

Character 2: [firmly] Maybe less.

Character 1: I keep thinking about that moderator in Seattle who ignored the warning signs until someone showed up at her daughter's school with printed screenshots of every post she'd ever removed. [voice breaking]

Character 2: [reassuring but urgent] That's not going to happen to you because we're going to install a full perimeter system tonight, infrared, motion-activated, cloud backup, and I'm personally monitoring it.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Why would you do all that for someone you don't even know, someone who just moderates arguments about UFOs and government cover-ups all day?

Character 2: [quietly intense] Because my sister was a forum admin who didn't have someone like me to help when her stalker found her, and I'm not letting that happen to anyone else.

Character 1: [emotional whisper] I'm sorry about your sister, God, I'm so sorry, and I'm grateful you're here, but I'm also terrified this is already beyond what either of us can control. [shaky breath]

Character 2: Control is just preparation meeting opportunity, and right now we're going to prepare for every scenario while documenting everything for law enforcement, starting with these motion sensors. [steadying]

Character 1: Okay, yes, let's do this, let's make my home a fortress if we have to, because I refuse to let some keyboard warrior force me out of the community work I've spent years building.

Character 2: [with grim satisfaction] That's the spirit, and trust me, once we're done, anyone approaching your property will be recorded, tracked, and reported before they even reach your fence line. [determined pause] We're going to end this.
