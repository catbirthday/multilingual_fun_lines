Scenario: A production sound mixer documents an embryologist who must make a recommendation about the fate of embryos left behind by a couple who died in an accident seven years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: The Hartmans' embryos have been in our care for seven years now, and every morning when I check the cryogenic storage, I think about what they would have wanted.

Character 2: [gently] That's why we're here, to document this process with the sensitivity it deserves, though I have to admit I've never recorded something quite this intimate before.

Character 1: They're viable still.

Character 2: How many couples go through this, leaving embryos behind without clear instructions about what should happen if they both... [trails off]

Character 1: [soft exhale] More than you'd think, and each situation tears at me differently because these aren't just biological material, they're potential lives that someone desperately wanted to bring into the world.

Character 2: [adjusting equipment quietly] The way you speak about them, it's clear this isn't just clinical work for you—there's something deeply personal happening here.

Character 1: Sarah Hartman used to bring me homemade cookies every appointment, and she'd ask me to play classical music near the storage units because she believed it would help somehow.

Character 2: Did you? [pause]

Character 1: [barely audible] Every single day since the accident, I've played Chopin's Nocturnes on my phone next to their storage unit, just five minutes each morning before anyone else arrives.

Character 2: [moved] That's something I want to capture in the audio, not just the facts of the case but these quiet acts of care that happen when no one's watching.

Character 1: [lingering on the thought] The court wants a recommendation by Friday about whether to donate them to research, offer them for adoption, or... the other option that nobody wants to say out loud.

Character 2: [carefully] What do you think they would have chosen, based on everything you knew about them during those years of treatments and conversations?

Character 1: [voice catching] They had names picked out already—Emma, James, and Lily—written on a little card Sarah kept in her wallet that the police returned to us with her effects.

Character 2: [softly] Names make everything more real, don't they? Suddenly it's not about embryos but about Emma, James, and Lily who never got their chance.

Character 1: [steadying] Which is why I'm recommending embryo adoption, even though the Hartmans' parents are fighting it, saying it would be too painful to know their grandchildren are out there somewhere.

Character 2: [thoughtful pause] The grandparents' pain is real too, but those names suggest the Hartmans saw these embryos as their future children, not just potential ones.

Character 1: [resolved] Tomorrow I'll submit my report, and then Emma, James, and Lily will have a chance at the life their parents dreamed of, just with different people to love them.

Character 2: Would you mind if I recorded you playing the Chopin tomorrow morning, one last time? [gentle pause]

Character 1: [whispered] I think Sarah would have liked that, knowing someone else understood why the music mattered, why all these small rituals we create around loss actually mean something.

Character 2: [accepting] Then I'll be here at 6 AM with my equipment, and we'll give them a proper goodbye with the music their mother believed would keep them company all these years.
