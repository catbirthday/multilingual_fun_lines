Scenario: A vehicle wrap installer recognizes their former business partner's luxury car when it comes in for a wrap, three years after the partner embezzled funds and disappeared.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: That's a nice McLaren you got there, [recognizing], haven't seen this exact model in silver since 2021.

Character 2: [casual] Yeah, just picked it up last month from a dealer in Miami, [defensive], figured it was time to treat myself after some, [shifting], good investments finally paid off.

Character 1: [cold] Well, um, funny thing about investments, I mean, they're usually made with, [bitter], your own money, aren't they?

Character 2: Look, I don't know what you're, [nervous], implying here but I came for a wrap job, not, [irritated], a lecture from some, [dismissive], random installer.

Character 1: Random installer—that's what I am now, [hollow laugh], three years after my business partner emptied our accounts and, [cracking], disappeared with everything we built together, [quiet], everything Marcus. [long pause]

Character 2: [stunned] Jesus, I didn't, [swallowing], I mean I heard you were still in the business but, [guilty], I never thought you'd be working, [trailing off], at someone else's shop. [exhales]

Character 1: [measured] Well, you know, um, it's hard to run your own shop when, uh, someone takes the deposit for twelve fleet contracts and, [controlled anger], vanishes with two hundred thousand dollars, I mean.

Character 2: [defensive] You can't prove anything.

Character 1: [laughing bitterly] Oh I don't need to prove anything anymore because, well, the lawyers already did that, umm, but you were gone by then, [steady], living it up in Costa Rica while I, [breaking], lost my house, weren't you?

Character 2: [desperate] Listen, um, I had debts you didn't know about, okay, people who, uh, weren't going to wait for payment plans and, well, [ashamed], I panicked and made a terrible, [voice cracking], terrible decision.

Character 1: [firm] A terrible decision that destroyed my credit, [angry], my reputation in this industry, and fifteen years of work.

Character 2: [remorseful] I know, um, I know what I did was unforgivable and, well, that's why I came here today, [hesitant], not just for the wrap.

Character 1: [skeptical] Right, so um, you just happened to pick this shop out of, well, all the places in the city, [sarcastic], pure coincidence that you'd walk into where I work now, umm, after three years?

Character 2: I've been watching your work on Instagram for months, [quiet], trying to figure out how to approach you about, [struggling], making things right somehow.

Character 1: [exhausted] Making things right would require a time machine to go back and, [bitter], stop you from destroying everything I'd worked for since I was nineteen, [hollow], everything my father taught me about this trade. [sighs heavily]

Character 2: [determined] I brought a cashier's check for seventy-five thousand.

Character 1: [shocked] Um, that's not even, well, half of what you took, and it sure as hell doesn't, [trembling], buy back three years of my life.

Character 2: [pleading] It's all I can access right now without my wife finding out about, [ashamed], what I did before we met, but there's more coming if you, [desperate], give me six months.

Character 1: [conflicted] Six months of what exactly, [suspicious], more lies to your wife while you try to clean up the mess you made of, [tired], both our lives?

Character 2: Six months to liquidate some properties and get you, [sincere], every penny back with interest, plus enough to, [determined], help you start your own shop again, [resolute], the way it should have been.
