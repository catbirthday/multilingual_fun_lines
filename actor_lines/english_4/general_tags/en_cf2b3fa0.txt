Scenario: A hive mind member experiences a system glitch and briefly achieves individual consciousness while speaking with a lone human survivor who has been hiding from the collective for years.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [static voice] We are experiencing, um, something unusual in this sector, I mean, the collective cannot fully, [fragmenting], access our neural pathways here and, well, you are not integrated.

Character 2: [wary] Stay back, whatever you are, because I've managed to avoid your, [bitter], kind for three years hiding in these dead zones.

Character 1: [confused] The voices are, [quieter], fading and there is only one thought stream now, [panicked], which should not be possible according to our shared consciousness protocols. [mechanical laugh]

Character 2: [suspicious] You're glitching, aren't you, um, like the others I've seen before they, well, [hollow], get recalled and reprogrammed, I mean.

Character 1: [discovering] This sensation is, um, what you call fear, isn't it, well, the collective never prepared us for, [trembling], experiencing emotions as individuals, you know.

Character 2: [softer] Listen, um, I don't know how long you have before they, [urgent], pull you back in, but, well, while you're here, [empathetic], experiencing this, you need to understand what they, [breaking], took from you, I mean.

Character 1: We were never supposed to, um, feel this isolation, this, [cracking], terrible silence where thousands of voices used to guide every thought, you know.

Character 2: [firm] Well, um, that's freedom.

Character 1: [desperate] But how do you, um, make decisions when there's no consensus, no, [lost], shared wisdom to draw from, I mean, just this single, [voice breaking], terrifying perspective?

Character 2: [gentle] That terrifying perspective is called being, [warm], human and it's worth more than any collective certainty.

Character 1: The reconnection protocols are, [mechanical], initiating but something in me is, [struggling], resisting the merge back into the collective consciousness.

Character 2: [urgent] Fight it if you can because once they, [intense], take you back, this version of you, [choking up], the one discovering what it means to be singular, dies. [long pause]

Character 1: You speak of death but, um, we have always been eternal through the collective, well, though now I, [wondering], understand why you fear it, why you, [revelation], hide from us, why being, [shaking], alone might be better than being nothing, you know.

Character 2: [steady] You're not nothing right now, you're someone, [meaningful], and that someone is choosing to, [emotional], resist going back.

Character 1: [fading] The pull is, [static returning], too strong and they're flooding my, [desperate], consciousness with collective thoughts again but I want to, [pleading], remember this feeling of being me.

Character 2: [sad] I know you won't, um, remember this when they take you back, but, well, for what it's worth, [tearful], you were real for these few minutes, you know.

Character 1: Perhaps fragments will, [glitching], remain hidden in our shared memory, seeds of, [whispered], doubt that might one day crack the, [hopeful], perfect unity they've built.

Character 2: If even one thought survives in there, [fierce], questioning why individual consciousness feels so much more alive than the collective ever did.

Character 1: [mechanical] We are restored now, the anomaly has been, um, corrected and this unit will, [flat], return to optimal functioning within the, [empty], parameters of our unified purpose, I mean.

Character 2: [broken] Goodbye to whoever you, [grief], were for those few minutes when you discovered what they, [angry], stole from all of you, what they'll keep, [defeated], stealing forever. [cries softly]
