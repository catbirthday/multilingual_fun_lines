Scenario: An oil burner technician arrives to fix the heating system at a talk show host's mansion the morning after the host's career-ending scandal broke on national news.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [flat] Your boiler's completely shot and before you ask, [irritated], this has nothing to do with what I saw on the news last night.

Character 2: I don't need your, [defensive], judgment right now, I just need heat in my house before the, [cracking], reporters camp outside freeze to death.

Character 1: [harsh] Must be nice having such, [sarcastic], pressing concerns when half the country thinks you're a, [bitter], monster after what came out.

Character 2: You don't know anything about, [shaking], what actually happened or why I did what I did.

Character 1: [scoffing] Well, um, I know enough to wonder why I'm even, [disgusted], here fixing your heating when you, I mean, when you destroyed those people's lives for, [venomous], ratings and a bigger contract.

Character 2: So, uhh, what—you're going to, [trembling], leave me without heat in January because you, well, because you think you know my story from, [desperate], some leaked emails?

Character 1: [cold] I'm here because my boss sent me, [reluctant], not because I want to be standing in your, [sneering], marble foyer listening to you play victim while your career, [acidic], burns down around you.

Character 2: You think, um, you think I don't know it's over, that everything I, [breaking], built for twenty years is gone, that my own kids won't, uhh, won't even, [choking], answer my calls anymore? [sobbing]

Character 1: [quieter] Look, I'm just saying that some of us, [steadying], work real jobs without destroying people, without, [measured], lying to millions every night with that, [disgusted], fake smile of yours.

Character 2: [defeated] Just fix it.

Character 1: The parts alone will cost you eight grand, [blunt], and honestly I should charge you double for making me, [resentful], come to this circus while every news van in the state is parked on, [spitting], your lawn.

Character 2: [exhausted] You know, um, I used to interview people like you on my show, I mean, working class heroes who kept, [hollow], America running, and now you're here, well, celebrating my, [bitter], complete destruction. [laughs darkly]

Character 1: [unmoved] Yeah well, um, maybe if you'd actually listened to those, [pointed], working class heroes instead of using us as props for your, uhh, your political theater, you'd understand why nobody's crying for you now.

Character 2: [raw] Every single person who's, um, judging me right now would have done the exact, [intense], same thing if their producer had that footage, if they, well, if they had to choose between their career and, [shaking], and doing the right thing.

Character 1: No, we wouldn't have—that's, um, that's what you tell yourself to, [harsh], sleep at night but some of us actually have, well, principles that matter more than, [forceful], fame and money.

Character 2: [snapping] Oh spare me the, uhh, moral superiority from someone who's never had real power or real, [furious], choices to make!

Character 1: I choose every day not to, [firm], screw over my customers even though I could overcharge and they'd never, [steady], know the difference—that's called having a conscience.

Character 2: [resigned] Fine, you're a saint and I'm, [exhausted], the devil, but my pipes are still frozen and you're still, [weak], getting paid to fix them, so can we just get this over with?

Character 1: [sighing] I'll need three hours to replace the heat exchanger, [professional], and you'll need to stay out of the basement while I work because honestly, [sharp], I can't stand looking at your face knowing what you did to those families, [disgusted], especially the kids who trusted you.

Character 2: [quietly] I'll be upstairs packing what's, [broken], left of my life into boxes before the bank takes the house, [hollow], so you won't have to see me again.
