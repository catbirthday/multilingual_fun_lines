Subject: Your companion work with elderly clients taught you about loneliness just as your own social circle disappeared

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very melancholic] You know what's funny? Well, not funny actually—it's more like, [bitter] I spent all these hours listening to Mrs. Chen talk about how her friends just... stopped calling. And I'd sit there, [empathetically] holding her hand, telling her she wasn't alone, that I understood. [pause] But honestly, I didn't. Not really. [regretful] I mean, how could I? I had my book club on Tuesdays, err, game nights every Friday, Sarah's dinner parties... [trailing off]

[quietly] And then somehow, um, everyone just got busy. [confused] Or maybe I did? The thing is, I can't even pinpoint when it happened. Like, one day I'm texting five different group chats and [very sad] suddenly I'm scrolling through old messages at 2 AM wondering if anyone would notice if I just... disappeared. 

[crying while speaking] Mr. Rodriguez told me yesterday that loneliness feels like drowning in reverse—you know, everybody else is breathing just fine while you're gasping for air that's right there. [sniffle] And I just nodded because, [shaky voice] God, that's exactly what this is. 

[very quietly] So now when Mrs. Chen says nobody calls anymore, I don't just hold her hand. [warm] I really get it. We're both just... [long pause] waiting for someone to remember we exist.
