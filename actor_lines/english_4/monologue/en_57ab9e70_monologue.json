Well, apparently she almost sent this really angry resignation letter to her old boss—I mean, the guy was terrible to her—but then she remembered our conversation. [chuckle] And now, um, that same boss just recommended her for this incredible position at another company.\n\n[pause]\n\nGod, you know, I basically torched my entire network when I left my first real job. [regretful] Like, I was so young and just... angry about everything. Sent this absolutely scathing email to everyone—literally everyone—on my way out. [sigh] Took me, what, five years to rebuild those relationships? Some of them never really recovered.\n\nBut Sarah, she's—[relieved] she actually listened to me.

[emotional] Sometimes you mentor someone and you're basically just talking into the void, hoping something sticks. \n\n[very sincerely] And here's this kid, avoiding all the stupid mistakes I made, actually learning from my disasters.
