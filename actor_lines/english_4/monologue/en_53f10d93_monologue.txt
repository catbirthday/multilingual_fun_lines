Subject: A regular customer left a note saying your cheerful service at the coffee cart helped them through cancer treatment

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Oh my God, I just—I can't even process this right now. They left a note? About me? [pause] I mean, I just make coffee, you know? I smile, I ask about people's days, it's not... [shaky voice] "Your cheerful service helped me through cancer treatment." Cancer. This whole time they were fighting cancer and I had no idea. [sniffle] I just thought they looked tired sometimes, um, maybe stressed from work or something. But they were—God, they were going through chemo? [crying while speaking] And somehow my stupid little jokes about the weather or asking if they wanted extra whipped cream actually mattered? [long pause] I keep reading it over and over. [very quietly] "You made the hardest days bearable." How do you even respond to that? Like, I'm just some person with an apron making lattes and apparently—apparently that meant something. [warm] All those mornings, they chose to come to my cart. Not the fancy place across the street, but here, to me. [emotional tremor] Maybe that's all we really need to do, honestly. Just show up and be kind. Because you never know who's barely holding it together, who needs that one bright spot. [deep breath] Wow. I'm definitely keeping this note forever.
