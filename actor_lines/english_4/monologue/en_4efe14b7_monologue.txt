Subject: Your new parent anxiety spiraled into checking the baby's breathing every ten minutes and your partner thinks you need help

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [defensive] I know what you're thinking, okay? I can see it in your face every time I get up to check. But you don't understand—it's not like I want to be doing this. [pause] Ten minutes isn't that often, honestly. Some parents check every five. I read that online. [anxious] And the way she breathes sometimes, it's so quiet, you can barely even tell if she's—I mean, what if something happens and we don't notice? [shaky voice] What if we're those parents on the news who just... didn't check?

[frustrated] You keep saying I need help, but this IS me helping. This is me making sure our baby is safe. [very quietly] I set timers on my phone. Three alarms rotating so I don't miss one. [crying while speaking] I haven't slept more than twenty minutes at a time in weeks and I know, I know that's not normal but I can't stop. [pause] Every time I try to skip a check, my chest gets so tight I can't breathe.

[exhausted] Maybe you're right. [long pause] Maybe this isn't actually keeping her safer. [very meekly] I just... I love her so much it physically hurts, you know? And if anything happened because I didn't check... [trailing off]
