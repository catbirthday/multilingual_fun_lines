Subject: Finally standing up to your bully, only to learn they were acting out because of abuse at home

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I did it. I finally—God, I actually told Jake off today. Like, right there in front of everyone, you know? [confidently] I just couldn't take it anymore, so I was like "Stop. Just stop treating me like garbage." And honestly, um, I was ready for him to hit me or whatever, but he just... [confused] he started crying? 

[pause] 

This kid who's been making my life hell for, what, two years? He's just standing there with tears running down his face, and then he's like—[very quietly] he tells me his dad beats him. That his dad calls him worthless every single day. [long pause] And I mean, here's the thing, I'm standing there thinking about all the times he shoved me into lockers, all the names he called me, and I should be, er, I should feel vindicated, right? But instead I just feel... [sad] God, I don't know. 

It's like, does that excuse what he did to me? No. Obviously not. But now I can't stop picturing him going home to that, and—[sniffle] I guess hurt people really do hurt people. [hesitantly] Maybe we're both just trying to survive in our own messed up ways. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this information. [exhausted] I really don't.
