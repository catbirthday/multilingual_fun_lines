[bitter] This is the same person who literally sat across from me and said—what was it—\"your idea lacks scalability.\" [sarcastic] Oh, and my favorite part, um, \"maybe you should consider getting more experience first.\" [laugh] More experience! Well, I mean, here we are five years later, and I've built three successful companies while they're, you know, [pause] asking ME for help. \n\nThe thing is, like, I should probably feel vindicated, right? [confused] But honestly, it's more just... hmm, I don't know. [slowly] Part of me wants to say yes just to, er, prove something. But prove what exactly? [frustrated] That I was right all along? They already know that—that's why they're calling! \n\n[sigh] And actually, their email was so, um, casual about it too. Like we're old friends or something. \"Hey, I've been following your success\"—[mocking] oh, NOW you're following my success? Where was that energy when I was literally begging for, what, fifty thousand dollars? \n\n[long pause] \n\nI guess the real question is whether I can, you know, [hesitantly] actually help their entrepreneurs without being... bitter about the whole thing. Because those kids deserve better than my, uh, my baggage. [warm] They deserve someone who believes in them from day one."
