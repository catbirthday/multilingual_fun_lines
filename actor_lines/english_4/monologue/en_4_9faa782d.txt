Subject: Your matte painter work on the film that was supposed to launch your career got completely cut

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] Six months. Six fucking months I spent on those landscapes. Every single detail, every... every little atmospheric effect, the way the light hit the mountains at sunset—I mean, I literally dreamed about those scenes. [pause] And they just... cut it all. [laugh] Not even a heads up, you know? I found out from the credits. [very sad] My name's not even there. 

The director said it was the best matte work he'd ever seen. [sarcastic] "Portfolio piece," he called it. Right. A portfolio piece nobody will ever see because, oh wait, it's not in the fucking movie. [sigh] 

I turned down two other jobs for this. [regretful] Real, paying jobs because this was supposed to be it, you know? The one that gets me noticed. My parents keep asking when they can see "my big movie" and I just... what do I even tell them? [trailing off] That I spent half a year painting invisible backgrounds?

[angry] And the worst part? They kept the terrible CGI dragon but cut my work because of "pacing." Pacing! [frustrated] Like anybody watching that mess cares about five extra minutes of actual artistry. 

[exhausted] I don't know, maybe I should just... go back to advertising. At least those actually get seen.
