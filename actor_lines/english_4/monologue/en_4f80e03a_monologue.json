I mean, honestly, when Sarah walked into that room with those two, um, I was so—[anxious] I thought for sure she'd freeze up, you know? Like she always does when there's confrontation. But then, [gasp softly] the way she just, er, took control? [laugh] I'm sitting there behind the glass thinking \"is this really my little dove?\" \n\n[pause] \n\nShe was so—[warm] god, I'm actually getting emotional about this. [sniffle] Six months ago she couldn't even, like, order coffee without rehearsing it first. And today? [excited] Today she's in there saying things like \"I hear what you're both saying\" and actually, hmm, meaning it! [chuckle] The thing is, I kept wanting to jump in, right? When that first guy started raising his voice, I literally had my hand on the door handle. [quickly] But then Sarah did this thing where she—[impressed] she just took this deep breath and goes \"let's take a moment,\" and honestly? [laugh loudly] They listened! \n\n[very sincerely] I guess what I'm trying to say is, um, I'm just so damn proud of her. [trailing off] All those practice sessions where she'd turn bright red and stammer... [smiling speaking] Look at her now."
