=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] They're calling me a hero. The board, the CEO, everyone's just... thrilled. Six months of restructuring and we're profitable again. [pause] And I keep thinking about Marcus sitting at home, probably seeing the news right now. [regretful] I mean, what am I supposed to tell him? "Hey buddy, remember when they let you go three months ago? Well, turns out I fixed everything, so... yay?" [sarcastic] Yeah, that'll go over great.

[frustrated] The thing is, um... the layoffs were necessary. [quietly] That's what I keep telling myself anyway. We cut forty percent of staff, including him, and now—now we're celebrating? [angry] God, they're literally planning a party. A party! [pause] While Marcus is still sending out resumes, still asking if I've heard of any openings.

[sad] He texted me congratulations this morning. Can you believe that? No bitterness, no... nothing. Just "Proud of you, man." [shaky voice] And I couldn't even reply because what do I say? "Thanks for understanding that I saved the company that threw you away?" 

[exhausted] I don't know, maybe I should've... I should've fought harder to keep him. But then we wouldn't have made the numbers and... [sigh] This is exactly why I hate this job sometimes. [very quietly] We save companies, not people.
