[frustrated] I spent three days calibrating those motion detectors to pick up anything bigger than a mouse. [pause] And they did! Oh boy, did they ever. Forty-seven alerts in the first night alone. Forty-seven! The homeowner called me at 2 AM asking how to disable the notifications because—and here's the kicker—their cat was setting it off. [sarcastic] A cat. That they never thought to mention during our four-hour consultation about their security needs. [laughs] So what do they do? They turn off the motion sensors. All of them. Because Princess Whiskers needs to roam freely at night. [angry] And then last Tuesday, someone walks right through their living room, takes their TV, their laptop, everything. [pause] The cameras caught it all beautifully, by the way. Crystal clear footage of a guy just... strolling through their house like he owned the place. [bitter] But the alarms never went off because they were disabled. For the cat. [sighs] I've installed hundreds of these systems, and this is, um... this is definitely a first. [resigned] I'm putting a pet clause in my contracts from now on. Big bold letters: \"Do you have any animals that move around at night?\""
