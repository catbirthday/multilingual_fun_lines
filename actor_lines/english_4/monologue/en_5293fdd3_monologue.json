[frustrated] The timing is just—I mean, we had interviews lined up, um, real opportunities at the hotel, the salon downtown. [angry] They don't care about that, do they? [sigh] The cops, the mayor, they see us as criminals, but I've been protecting these girls since— [very melancholic] since before half of them were even born. [shaky voice] Maria was going to start her nursing program next month. I'd already paid her tuition. [upset] And Sophie, she's got her kids to think about, you know? [clearing throat] What's she supposed to do now, honestly, go back on the street? [passionately] That's what they don't understand—I was their safety net, their way out when they were ready. [regretful] Maybe I should've started the transition program sooner, but, well, I thought we had more time. [very quietly] Twenty-three women counting on me, and I— [cry] I failed them. [exhausted] All those years building something that actually protected people, and they tear it down in one afternoon."
