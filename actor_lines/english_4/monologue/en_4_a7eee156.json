[exhausted] I keep thinking about Jake's face when they read the verdict though. [sad] He wouldn't even look at me. Twenty years of friendship and now... [sigh] I mean, what was I supposed to do? [frustrated] His company's negligence literally destroyed that woman's life. [angry] She can't walk without pain anymore! But he kept insisting it wasn't their fault, that she should've been more careful. [bitter] Really? A wet floor with no signs? [sarcastic] Yeah, totally her fault. [pause] The worst part is, um... he texted me last night. [shaky voice] Said I chose money over friendship. [upset] That's not—God, that's not what this was about at all. [very quietly] Mrs. Chen deserved justice. [empathetically] Her medical bills alone were crushing her family. [passionately] And Jake's company had seventeen similar incidents they never reported! [shouting] Seventeen! [trailing off] So yeah, I did my job and... [very sad] I guess that means losing him. [sniffle] Maybe he was never really my friend if he could watch someone suffer like that and just... not care. [regretful] I don't know anymore."
