Her hands were so— [chuckle] they moved so fast, I mean, I couldn't keep up. [nostalgic] And now here I am, literally making hundreds of them every week for, um, actual paying customers. [pause] It's kind of surreal, honestly.\n\n[excited] Last month we catered this huge corporate event and they specifically requested Mama's mole recipe— [proudly] the one she brought from Oaxaca forty years ago! I was just, [emotional], standing there watching these executives basically licking their plates clean. [laugh] My mother, er, she started crying when I showed her the reviews.\n\n[hesitantly] The thing is, we almost didn't do this. I mean, [frustrated] everyone kept saying \"Mexican food is too niche\" or whatever. But then, [determined] I thought, no—these recipes fed our family through everything. [passionately] Through immigration, through poverty, through— [trailing off] everything.\n\n[very sincerely] And now, well, we're booked solid through December. [extremely happy] My cousins are helping, my tío quit his factory job to join us, and, um— [crying while speaking] these recipes that crossed borders in my grandmother's memory are now, you know, they're our future. [sigh] Isn't that something?"
