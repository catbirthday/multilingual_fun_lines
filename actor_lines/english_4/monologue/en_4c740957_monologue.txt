Subject: Being promoted to superior after years of proving yourself and genuinely wanting to uplift everyone who supported your journey

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very excited] Oh my God, I just—I can't even process this right now, like, they actually said yes! [laugh] Seven years, you know? Seven whole years of, um, basically proving myself over and over, and honestly [pause] it finally happened. [emotional] I keep thinking about Marcus, who, er, stayed late with me on that first project when I was just—[trailing off] And Sarah, God, Sarah who literally taught me everything about, well, about believing in myself when I was ready to quit. [sniffle] 

The thing is, [passionately] this isn't just about me getting some fancy title, right? I mean, [very sincerely] every single person who lifted me up, who, uh, who saw something in me when I couldn't see it myself—they're all getting promoted with me, in a way. [warm] Like, emotionally, spiritually, I don't know, [laugh softly] does that make sense? 

[confidently] Here's what I'm gonna do though—I'm using this position to, um, to actually change things. No more of that, you know, climbing the ladder and pulling it up behind you garbage. [animated] I'm keeping that ladder down, hell, I'm building more ladders! [determined] Because honestly, success means nothing if you're standing up there alone, right? [very quietly] Mom always said that. [emotional] She'd be so proud.
