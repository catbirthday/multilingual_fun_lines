Subject: The financial counselor position you fought for is being eliminated because the hospital can't afford patient advocacy anymore

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [frustrated] They can't afford patient advocacy. Um, that's—that's what they actually said to me. The hospital, right, this massive institution that charges, what, eight hundred dollars for aspirin? [bitter] They can't afford to keep the one person who helps patients navigate their medical debt. [pause] I mean, honestly, I fought for two years to create this position. Two years of, like, presentations and budget proposals and showing them how much money we actually saved by, you know, preventing bankruptcies and keeping people from just—[angry] God, the irony is just... [sigh] 

So basically, what happens now to Mrs. Chen who's, er, drowning in chemo bills? Or that kid—[very sad] that nineteen-year-old with type 1 diabetes who literally rations his insulin? [shaky voice] I was the only one helping them understand payment plans, charity care, I mean—[pause] The CFO looked me straight in the eye and said, [mocking] "We have to prioritize core operations." [furious] Core operations! As if, hmm, keeping people from losing their homes after cancer treatment isn't core to what a hospital should— [trailing off]

[exhausted] Anyway, they're giving me thirty days. Thirty days to, uh, wrap up active cases and just... abandon everyone else. [very quietly] Five years of this work, and they're just... [sniffle] it's done.
