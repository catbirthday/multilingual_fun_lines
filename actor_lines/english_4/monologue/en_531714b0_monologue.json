For three weeks I've been sitting with them, um, bringing them coffee, telling them we'd find who did this to their home. [bitter] And the whole time they knew—God, they sat there crying while I promised them justice. [frustrated] The pour patterns, they lead directly from the garage through the kitchen, exactly where, uh, where Michael said he was sleeping when it started. Nobody sleeps through that smell, [angry] nobody. And Sarah, she kept asking me, like, really specific questions about insurance investigations, and I thought—[very quietly] I thought she was just anxious about the claim. [gasp softly] Their daughter's toys. They moved all of Emma's toys to the shed the day before. Who does that? [confused] I mean, honestly, who thinks to reorganize storage right before your house randomly catches fire? [sarcastic] Such convenient timing, right? The financial records I pulled this morning, they're basically—[exhaling sharply] they're drowning in debt. Two mortgages, credit cards maxed, and then boom, mysterious fire. [very sad] That little girl hugged me yesterday. Emma hugged me and said thank you for helping mommy and daddy. [whispering] How do I even write this report? [pause] They played me. [enunciating every word] They looked me in the eye and played me."
