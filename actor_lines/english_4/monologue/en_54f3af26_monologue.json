[crying while speaking] Every single one, handwritten on these little index cards with, um, notes in the margins about which grandchild liked what. I only ever... I mean, all I did was save her a maple bar every Thursday and ask about her week. [sniffle] That's literally all I did.\n\n[warm] She wrote on this envelope here—\"For the sweet girl who never let me eat alone.\" I didn't even realize she was... [trailing off] I thought she just liked talking while she had her coffee. [very quietly] God, I should've done more. Should've sat with her longer or, like, I don't know, invited her for actual dinner or something.\n\n[chuckle] This one says \"Arthur's favorite - make when you miss someone.\" Arthur was her husband. She told me about him every week. [empathetically] These aren't just recipes, they're her whole life, you know? Sixty years of birthdays and holidays and—[gasp] wait, this one's from her mother. From Shanghai. It's in Chinese and English.\n\n[very sincerely] How do you even thank someone for something like this? She basically just handed me her family's heart."
