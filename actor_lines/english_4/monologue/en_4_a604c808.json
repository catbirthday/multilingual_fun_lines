[warm] God, I remember when he showed up at my door with that backpack falling apart, couldn't even afford a hostel. Three weeks he crashed on my couch. Three weeks of him apologizing every morning like he was some kind of burden. [chuckle] I kept telling him, \"It's just a couch, man, it's fine.\" \n\n[pause] \n\n[slowly] But reading this article, it says he houses forty people a month now. Forty! That's, um... that's almost five hundred people a year who don't have to sleep rough because of what he built. [very sincerely] And there's this quote where he talks about how someone once gave him a couch when he had nothing, and that's what made him believe in... in paying it forward. [sniffle] That was me. That was my ratty old couch he's talking about. \n\n[emotional] I mean, I wasn't trying to change the world or anything. I just had space and he needed help. But now all these people have homes because I, uh... because I said yes that night. [quietly] Sometimes the smallest things end up mattering the most, don't they?"
