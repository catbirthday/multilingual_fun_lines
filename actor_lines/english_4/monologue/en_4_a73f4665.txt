Subject: Your best friend asking you to be their child's godparent

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Wait, are you—are you serious? You want me to be... oh my god. [pause] I mean, I just—wow, I wasn't expecting this at all. You're actually asking me to be the godparent? [very sincerely] That's like, that's huge. I'm honestly kind of, um... I don't even know what to say right now. [emotional] This is probably the most important thing anyone's ever asked me to do. 

I keep thinking about all those nights we stayed up talking about, you know, what we wanted our lives to look like someday. [warm] And now you have this perfect little human and you're trusting me with—geez, that's a lot of responsibility, isn't it? [laugh] But also like... of course I'll do it. Obviously. Did you really think I'd say no? 

[shaky voice] I'm gonna cry. No, I'm already crying. This is ridiculous. I just—I love you guys so much, and I already love that baby more than I thought was possible. [sniffle] I promise I'll be the best godparent. Like, I'll spoil them rotten but also, you know, teach them important life stuff. [chuckle] Mostly the spoiling though. God, come here, I need to hug you right now.
