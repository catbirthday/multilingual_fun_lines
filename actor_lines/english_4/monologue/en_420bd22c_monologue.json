[bitter] Eight months of \"great exposure\" and \"invaluable experience\" and, um, what exactly do I have to show for it? [pause] So like, yesterday Sarah asked me if I was excited about the new project and I'm thinking, [sarcastic] oh yeah, super excited to work another sixty hours for free while Brad gets promoted to the position they, er, supposedly don't have budget for. [angry] The thing is—God, I'm such an idiot—they kept saying, you know, \"just wait until Q3\" and then it was \"after the merger\" and now it's, [mocking] \"we're restructuring but you're so valued here.\" [laugh] Valued! That's—honestly that's hilarious because, uhh, I can't even afford my subway pass anymore. [very sad] My parents keep asking when I'll get a \"real job\" and I keep defending this place like, [mumbling] oh no, it's actually a great opportunity, I'm learning so much.
