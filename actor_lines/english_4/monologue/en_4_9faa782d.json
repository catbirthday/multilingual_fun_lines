Every single detail, every... every little atmospheric effect, the way the light hit the mountains at sunset—I mean, I literally dreamed about those scenes. [pause] And they just... cut it all. [laugh] Not even a heads up, you know? I found out from the credits. [very sad] My name's not even there. \n\nThe director said it was the best matte work he'd ever seen. [sarcastic] \"Portfolio piece,\" he called it. Right. A portfolio piece nobody will ever see because, oh wait, it's not in the fucking movie. [sigh] \n\nI turned down two other jobs for this. [regretful] Real, paying jobs because this was supposed to be it, you know? The one that gets me noticed. My parents keep asking when they can see \"my big movie\" and I just... what do I even tell them? [trailing off] That I spent half a year painting invisible backgrounds?\n\n[angry] And the worst part? They kept the terrible CGI dragon but cut my work because of \"pacing.\" Pacing! [frustrated] Like anybody watching that mess cares about five extra minutes of actual artistry. \n\n[exhausted] I don't know, maybe I should just... go back to advertising. At least those actually get seen."
