=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp loudly] No way. No fucking way. This isn't— this isn't real, right? [laugh histerically] Five years of playing "Sweet Child O' Mine" at dive bars and suddenly we're opening for Guns N' Roses? [pause] I keep reading the email. Over and over. Like maybe I'm misunderstanding something. But it says it right there: "pleased to offer you the opening slot." [extremely happy] This is everything! This is literally everything we've been working towards! All those Tuesday night rehearsals in Jimmy's garage, all those empty venues where we played to like twelve people— [shaky voice] oh my god, I might actually cry. I mean, Slash is going to be there. Slash! The guy whose solos I learned note for note when I was fourteen. And now I'm gonna play on the same stage? [anxious] What if we mess up? What if I forget the lyrics to our own songs? No, no, can't think like that. We've earned this. We're good, we're, um... we're really good actually. [passionately] God, I wish my dad could see this! He bought me my first guitar. Said I'd never amount to anything with it, but— [laugh] here we are. Opening for the band whose poster is still on my childhood bedroom wall. [confidently] We're gonna blow everyone away.
