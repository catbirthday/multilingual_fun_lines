Subject: Learning that your patient mentoring of a new employee helped them avoid the career mistakes you made

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Sarah just sent me this email and I—honestly, I wasn't expecting this at all. [warm] She said that thing I told her about not burning bridges when you leave a job? Well, apparently she almost sent this really angry resignation letter to her old boss—I mean, the guy was terrible to her—but then she remembered our conversation. [chuckle] And now, um, that same boss just recommended her for this incredible position at another company.

[pause]

God, you know, I basically torched my entire network when I left my first real job. [regretful] Like, I was so young and just... angry about everything. Sent this absolutely scathing email to everyone—literally everyone—on my way out. [sigh] Took me, what, five years to rebuild those relationships? Some of them never really recovered.

But Sarah, she's—[relieved] she actually listened to me. The thing is, I never knew if any of my advice was actually, er, getting through, you know? [emotional] Sometimes you mentor someone and you're basically just talking into the void, hoping something sticks. 

[very sincerely] And here's this kid, avoiding all the stupid mistakes I made, actually learning from my disasters. It's like... [trailing off] I don't know, maybe all those mistakes were worth something after all.
