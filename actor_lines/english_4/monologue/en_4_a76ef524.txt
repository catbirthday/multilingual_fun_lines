Subject: Being the lookout who successfully warned everyone about danger, but realizing you're always watching instead of living

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] Everyone's safe. That's what matters, right? I saw it coming—the smoke, the way the wind shifted—and I got everyone out in time. They're calling me a hero and... I mean, I guess I am? [pause] But here's the thing that's been, um, eating at me. While everyone else was dancing, laughing, actually living in that moment before everything went wrong, I was... watching. Always watching. [sad] That's what I do. That's all I ever do, really. 

I can tell you exactly when Sarah's mood shifts at a party, or when Tom's about to make a bad decision, or when something dangerous is about to happen. But I can't tell you what it feels like to just, uh... to just be there. To let go. [bitter] Everyone else gets to close their eyes when they kiss someone. They get to lose themselves in the music. But me? I'm scanning exits, watching body language, looking for threats that usually aren't even there. [sigh]

They needed me this time. Thank God I was watching this time. But what about all the other times when nothing happened? All those moments I missed because I was too busy being everyone's guardian angel? [very quietly] Sometimes I wonder if I'm even really alive, or if I'm just... some kind of security camera with a heartbeat.
