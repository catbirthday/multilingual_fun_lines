=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] We actually did it! I mean, honestly, when we started this whole thing eighteen months ago, I—[laugh] everyone thought we were crazy, you know? Running on climate action and, like, actual justice reform? [pause] But here's the thing, um, people were ready for it. They were so ready. 

[warm] All those volunteers who showed up at five in the morning to knock on doors in the rain—God, I'm getting emotional just thinking about it. [sniffle] It's just that, er, nobody believed we could beat the machine, right? The oil money, the—[bitter] the attack ads calling us radical extremists for wanting clean air. 

[relieved] But we just kept going. And tonight, [very slowly] when they called it... I couldn't even process it at first. Like, wait wait wait, did they really just say we won? [gasp softly] By eight points! 

[passionately] This means we can actually implement the green jobs program! The community solar initiative, the—oh my God, the criminal justice reforms we promised. [shaky voice] Those families we met, they're finally going to get... [trailing off] 

[very sincerely] I guess what I'm trying to say is, um, we proved something tonight. That you can run on hope and science and, well, actually win.
