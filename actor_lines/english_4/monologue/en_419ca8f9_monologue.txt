=== Dialogue ===

Marcus fucking Chen just sent me this whole, um, this whole thing about how I— [bitter] how I taught him about resilience? [laugh] Are you kidding me? He made my life hell for three years, and now he's— [shaky voice] he's saying that watching me show up every day despite what he did taught him something? [long pause] I don't know how to feel about this. Part of me wants to just delete it, you know? Like, [angry] where was this revelation when I was eating lunch in the bathroom? When I was— [trailing off] But then... [hesitantly] he mentioned specific things. The science fair project he destroyed. The time with my inhaler. [sniffle] He remembers all of it. [slowly] And he's actually taking responsibility, not doing that whole "we were just kids" thing that people do. [sigh] I mean, I did keep showing up.
