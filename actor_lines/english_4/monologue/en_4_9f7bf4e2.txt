Subject: Your startup success allowing you to hire back the team that got laid off, but knowing you can't save everyone

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] I got the funding. We got the funding, actually—series A closed yesterday. Twenty million. [pause] And the first thing I did was pull up that old org chart from before the layoffs. Sarah, Marcus, the whole design team... [excited] I can bring them back! I mean, most of them. [trailing off] Most of them.

[quietly] That's the thing nobody tells you about success, right? It's not enough. Twenty million sounds like everything until you realize it's, um... it's maybe twelve people max. [bitter] Twelve out of forty-three. [pause] How do you even choose? Like, do I take back the ones who need it most, or the ones we need most? 

[frustrated] God, I keep thinking about Jenny. Single mom, been freelancing for scraps since we let her go. She texted me last week about her kid's medical bills. [sigh] But then there's David who literally built our entire backend architecture. We need him. The company needs him. 

[shaky voice] I called Marcus first. He just... he started crying on the phone. Said he'd been driving Uber nights. [pause] Senior engineer driving Uber. [angry] Because some VC decided we were "overcapitalized" last year.

[slowly] I have this list on my desk. Names crossed out, added back, crossed out again. [very sad] Each line is someone's mortgage, someone's family, someone's... everything. And I get to play God with it because my stupid app finally caught on. [pause]

[whispering] I'm saving who I can. That's what I keep telling myself. [hesitantly] But the ones I can't call back—they're going to see the announcement. They'll know I chose not to choose them.
