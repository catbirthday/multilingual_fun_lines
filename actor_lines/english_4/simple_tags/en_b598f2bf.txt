Scenario: A second cousin who became a successful therapist arrives to mediate between estranged siblings after their parents' sudden death left the youngest alone.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [warm] When your brother called me about mediating this, [hesitantly], I wasn't sure if coming here would help, but seeing you now, [concerned], I realize how much you've been carrying alone since the funeral.

Character 2: [very meekly] Everyone just left after the service and I've been, [confused], trying to figure out what Mom and Dad would have wanted, while also, [shaky voice], dealing with all these legal papers and decisions I don't understand. [sigh]

Character 1: [gently] The thing is, your siblings are, [frustrated], struggling with their own guilt about leaving you here, and they don't know how to, [pause], reconnect without feeling like they've failed you.

Character 2: They haven't called or texted in three months, not even to, [bitter], check if I'm eating or sleeping or managing the house payments.

Character 1: [empathetically] Well, um, I've been talking with them separately and, like, they're scared you hate them for, [anxious], moving away when things got hard, but they also, I mean, [regretful], don't know how to bridge this gap that's grown between all of you.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I just, umm, needed someone to stay, you know, after Mom got sick and Dad started, [whispering], forgetting our names, but everyone had their own lives and careers, and I, well, [trailing off], I was the only one still in high school so—

Character 1: [softly] You became the caretaker by default, and, um, that wasn't fair to you, but, like, [very quietly], your siblings didn't know how to handle watching your parents, [slowly], decline either.

Character 2: So they just, umm, ran away and left me to, well, [monotone], watch them die alone. 

Character 1: [apologetic] Um, I know.

Character 2: [whispered] Well, you don't, really.

Character 1: [firmly] Umm, actually I do.

Character 2: [surprised] Your parents died when you were twenty-three and you had, [angry], already graduated college and started your practice, not stuck in high school watching them, [very sadly], waste away.

Character 1: [sincerely] That's true, but before I became a therapist, [defensive], I spent two years caring for my grandmother with dementia while my own siblings, [jealous], built their perfect lives elsewhere, so I understand the abandonment you're feeling. [deep breath]

Character 2: Then why are you, like, defending them when you know, umm, [exhausted], how much it hurts to be the only one who stayed?

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Because holding onto that anger will eat you alive the way it almost, [passionately], destroyed me before I learned that people handle grief differently, and sometimes, [cheerful], running away is just another form of love that can't bear to watch.

Character 2: [curious] How can abandonment be love when it left me, [upset], dealing with hospice nurses and funeral directors and lawyers while trying to, [quickly], finish my senior year and apply to colleges?

Character 1: [confident] Well, I mean, your brother wire transferred thirty thousand dollars to cover the funeral costs, and, like, your sister, [protective], has been calling me every day since to make sure you're okay, even though she can't, umm, [relieved], bring herself to call you directly because she's terrified of your anger.

Character 2: [stunned] She calls you every day to ask about me but won't just, [sarcastically], pick up the phone and ask me herself?

Character 1: She's convinced you hate her for missing Mom's last words and Dad's final, [trembling], lucid moment when he remembered all your names, and the guilt is, [whispering loudly], paralyzing her ability to reach out.

Character 2: [very sincerely] I recorded those moments on my phone because I knew, well, someday they'd want to hear them, and I've been waiting, like, [hopeful], three months for them to ask. [laugh sadly]
