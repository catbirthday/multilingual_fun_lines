            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[thoughtfully] So you knew about Harold's daughter all along, even when he was alive. [pause] Did he ask you to do this, or was this entirely your decision after he refused to acknowledge her?"

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[carefully] He knew she existed but wanted nothing to do with the situation, said it would complicate things with you and the family. [quietly] But he never explicitly told me to stop when he noticed the discrepancies in the quarterly reports."

            "role": "Character 1",
