=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [furious] You knew those safety protocols were inadequate when you pushed the software update through! Twenty-three people died because you wanted to beat your competitor to market by two weeks!

Character 2: Business is about calculated risks, and statistically speaking, twenty-three casualties out of two million users is actually an exceptional safety record. [condescending] You wouldn't understand the pressures of running a multibillion-dollar corporation.

Character 1: Those were mothers, fathers, children with names and futures you stole! [shouting] Not statistics on your quarterly report!

Character 2: [over confidently] Every innovation requires sacrifice, and I've created more value for society than any court could measure. My technologies have saved thousands of lives overall.

Character 1: [exhausted] I've heard that rationalization from every corporate killer I've tracked down. [bitter] You all think you're special, above consequences because you generate profit.

Character 2: [animated] I am special! [insisting] I've revolutionized three industries before I turned forty. The world needs people like me more than it needs your outdated sense of justice.

Character 1: [stern] The law failed those families when it let you walk free on a technicality. [very quietly] But I don't operate on technicalities.

Character 2: [anxious] Look, if this is about money, I can make you wealthy beyond imagination. [quickly] Everyone has a price, even vigilantes playing hero.

Character 1: [sarcastic] Right, because money fixes everything in your world. [angry] Tell me, what's the going rate for a human life in your spreadsheets?

Character 2: [defensive] Three million dollars.

Character 1: You actually have a number ready. [disgusted] That's exactly why the system can't judge people like you properly. [sighs] You've turned human suffering into a line item.

Character 2: Insurance companies do it every day, governments do it when they decide healthcare budgets! [frustrated] At least I'm honest about the reality of resource allocation!

Character 1: [very slowly] Those twenty-three people trusted your product to keep them safe. [passionate] Their families trusted your company's promises, and you betrayed them for a market advantage.

Character 2: [mocking] Spare me the moral grandstanding! You're about to murder me in cold blood, how does that make you any different from me?

Character 1: [very sincerely] The difference is I'm willing to bear the weight of what I do. [pause] You hide behind lawyers and corporate structures to avoid accountability.

Character 2: This is insane! [pleading] I created jobs for thousands of people, I donate millions to charity every year!

Character 1: [coldly] Tax write-offs and PR campaigns don't erase the blood on your hands. [firmly] You had a choice that day, and you chose profit over people.

Character 2: [desperately] If you kill me, my innovations die with me! [speeding up] The medical devices I'm developing could save millions of lives in the next decade!

Character 1: [quietly] Someone else will develop them, someone who might actually test them properly first. [resigned] Your ego makes you think you're irreplaceable, but you're not.

Character 2: [bitter] Fine, pull the trigger then! [loudly] But we both know you need people like me to exist, or you'd have no purpose in your pathetic vigilante fantasy!
