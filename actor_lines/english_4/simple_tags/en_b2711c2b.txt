Scenario: A troubled youth confronts the honor student who secretly wrote their college application essay after discovering they got accepted to their dream school.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] I found the draft on your computer when I was returning your laptop and, [shaky voice], I need to know why you did this for me.

Character 2: You weren't supposed to know.

Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, I know now and it's making me feel like, [frustrated], everything I thought I earned is just, [quietly], another lie I've been telling myself, you know? [sigh]

Character 2: [warm] I mean, look, the essay was just words on paper but, [empathetically], the acceptance came from your grades improving and, um, your volunteer hours that you actually did.

Character 1: But the essay is what made them, [anxious], see past my record and give me a chance when, [trailing off], nobody else would have looked twice at someone like me.

Character 2: [relieved] Well, um, I watched you struggle for months trying to, [slowly], put your story into words that, er, wouldn't scare them away. [laugh]

Character 1: [upset] So, uh, you just decided to fix me like I'm some, [angry], broken project you could put on your college applications, I mean?

Character 2: That's not what this was.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] You know, um, I've been walking around campus feeling like, [proudly], I finally made something of myself but it's all, [whispering], fake because you wrote the words that got me there, err. [groan]

Character 2: [defensive] Well, uh, I wrote about your truth using words you couldn't, [passionately], find because the system taught you to hate your own story, you know?

Character 1: Maybe that's true but, um, it still feels like, [exhausted], I'm living someone else's version of my life, you know. [pause]

Character 2: [sincerely] I mean, every achievement since then has been yours and, [confidently], nobody can take that away from you, er. [clearing throat]

Character 1: [withdrawn] The thing that hurts most is that you never, [bored], told me even after we became friends because you kept, [mocking], pretending like I earned everything myself. [cough]

Character 2: [apologetic] Um, I wanted to tell you so many times but, [regretful], watching you finally believe in yourself seemed more important than, well, clearing my conscience. [sniffle]

Character 1: [determined] So, um, what happens now that we both know the truth and, [nervously], can't pretend anymore about how I really got here, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 2: [honest] What happens is you stop letting one essay define, [firmly], your worth when you've proven yourself a hundred times over since, [speeding up], getting that acceptance letter.

Character 1: I need time to figure out if, [confused], I can forgive you or if I even, [very quietly], want to stay at a school I didn't really earn.

Character 2: [sad] Well, um, whatever you decide just remember that, [trembling], the person graduating won't be who I wrote about, err.

Character 1: [softly] Maybe you're right about that but it doesn't, [deeply], change the fact that you took away my chance to fail or, [monotone], succeed on my own terms when it mattered most. [long pause]

Character 2: [tearfully] I know I can't undo what I did but, [desperate], please don't throw away your future just to, [whispering loudly], punish me for trying to help when I should have, [very slowly], just believed you could do it yourself. [cry]
