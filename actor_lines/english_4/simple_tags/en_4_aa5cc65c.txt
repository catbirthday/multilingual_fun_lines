=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [fervently] You finally stayed late enough for us to talk properly, just the two of us without all those other people crowding around you at every single event. [exhales] I've been waiting months for this exact moment.

Character 2: The bookstore closed an hour ago, so I'm not really sure how you got in here or why you think we need to have this conversation right now.

Character 1: [excitedly] I know everything about you—your writing schedule, that you drink Earl Grey at exactly 3 PM, how you tap your left foot when you're stuck on a chapter. [quickly] Your dedication in my book wasn't random, was it?

Character 2: [very calmly] Those dedications are generated by my publisher's marketing team based on purchase data and reader demographics, nothing personal. [pause] Look, I appreciate devoted readers, but this is making me uncomfortable.

Character 1: [passionately] No, no, you're lying to protect what we have from people who wouldn't understand! [laughs] The seventeenth word of every third chapter in your last book spells out a message—I decoded it, I know what you're really saying to me.

Character 2: [carefully] That's just coincidence, honestly, there's no hidden message in any of my books. [clearing throat] Why don't we go outside where there's better lighting and maybe call someone to pick you up?

Character 1: [hurt] You're scared of the connection between us, I get that, but you don't have to pretend anymore. [shaky voice] I've documented every single time you looked at me during readings—seventeen times at the Barnes & Noble event, twenty-three at the library fundraiser.

Character 2: [gently] I look at lots of people during readings because that's what authors do, we engage with our entire audience. [sighs] But counting my glances isn't healthy behavior, and I think you probably know that deep down.

Character 1: [desperately] Please, just admit it.

Character 2: [firmly] There's nothing to admit except that you need professional help, and I'm genuinely concerned about your wellbeing right now. [slowly] This obsession isn't love or connection—it's something that's hurting both of us.

Character 1: [angrily] You think I'm crazy, but I have proof—emails from your private account, photos of you at places you never posted about online! [triumphantly] You can't deny physical evidence of our bond, can you?

Character 2: [alarmed] You've been hacking my email and following me to private locations? [very quietly] That's stalking, and it's illegal, and now I'm definitely calling the police because this has gone way too far.

Character 1: [pleading] Wait, don't call anyone, please, I just wanted you to see how devoted I am to your work, to you! [crying while speaking] Everything I've done has been out of pure admiration and love for your genius.

Character 2: [shaking] Love doesn't involve breaking into buildings or stealing private information or following someone without their consent. [exhales] You've turned something that should be beautiful—the relationship between writer and reader—into something genuinely frightening.

Character 1: [bitterly] You're just like them.

Character 2: [confused] Like who?

Character 1: [menacingly] The others who didn't appreciate true dedication, who called it unhealthy when it was actually the purest form of admiration. [coldly] But they learned eventually that rejecting someone like me has consequences they never anticipated.

Character 2: [terrified] Are you threatening me right now? [stuttering] Because I'm recording this entire conversation on my phone, and whatever happened with these mysterious 'others' you're talking about sounds like something the authorities need to know about immediately.

Character 1: I'm not threatening you, I'm trying to save you from making the same mistake they did when they pushed me away. [pause] But if you call the police, if you ruin this moment, then everything changes.

Character 2: Everything already changed the moment you broke in here and revealed you've been stalking me for months. [firmly] I'm leaving now, and you're going to let me go, because adding physical assault to your list of crimes won't help either of us. [long pause] Get help.
