Scenario: A successful sales representative meets with a philanthropy advisor to discuss donating their recently deceased mother's substantial estate to charity, while struggling with feelings of guilt about their strained relationship.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] I, um, appreciate you meeting me so quickly because, well, I've been, [anxious], selling products my whole life but I've never had to, [shaky voice], figure out how to give something this, [quietly], meaningful away before.

Character 2: Well, I mean, inheriting an estate while grieving is, [empathetically], one of the most challenging experiences anyone faces, and, um, the fact that you're thinking about, [warm], philanthropy during this time shows remarkable, [sincerely], character and strength. [pause]

Character 1: [relieved] My mother's estate is worth about twelve million dollars which, [confused], seems impossible because she lived so, [slowly], modestly her entire life. [sigh]

Character 2: Um, many people who accumulate wealth, you know, choose to live below their means because, [passionately], they find more value in security or, well, [gently], future giving than in present consumption.

Character 1: The truth is we hadn't spoken in, [bitter], five years when she passed and now suddenly I'm supposed to, [frustrated], honor her wishes about charities she cared about more than, [trembling], her own daughter apparently.

Character 2: Sometimes people express love through, [cautiously], legacy giving in ways they couldn't express, [sad], directly in life due to complicated family dynamics.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] I mean, um, she left detailed notes about every charity but not, well, [angry], a single personal message for me except, you know, [whispering], instructions to contact you about managing her, [trailing off], philanthropic vision.

Character 2: [apologetic] Well, I actually, um, have something else here that she, er, [nervously], asked me to give you only after we'd discussed, [clearing throat], the charitable distributions first because she thought you'd, [carefully], understand her better through her giving choices. [long pause]

Character 1: Um, wait, you mean she left me something personal after all but, well, [shocked], made it conditional on me learning about, er, [loudly], her charitable interests first? [gasp]

Character 2: [formal] She believed that understanding someone's values through, [confidently], their philanthropic choices reveals their, [proudly], deepest beliefs and hopes.

Character 1: [whispering loudly] That's so her.

Character 2: [excited] Well, um, let me show you her giving portfolio which includes, er, [animated], education initiatives for teenage mothers, addiction recovery programs, and, you know, [smiling speaking], family reconciliation counseling services.

Character 1: Um, those are all things that, well, [stunned], affected our relationship directly. [cough]

Character 2: [very quietly] She specifically earmarked three million for a program that, [emotionally], helps mothers and daughters rebuild relationships after, [regretful], long estrangements. [sniffle]

Character 1: [tearfully] She was trying to fix things for other people that we never could fix ourselves.

Character 2: [delighted] She also left instructions that if you choose to be involved with, [hopefully], any of these charities personally rather than just, [cheerful], financially.  [laugh]

Character 1: [curious] You know, um, I've spent twenty years, well, [thoughtfully], convincing people to buy things they don't need and maybe it's, [determined], time I learned how to give instead. [deep pitch]

Character 2: [playful] Well, I mean, your sales experience could actually be, er, [overly polite], invaluable in fundraising because philanthropy is really just, [joking], selling hope instead of products.

Character 1: Um, er, maybe working on her charities will help me, [very melancholic], understand who she really was. [groan]

Character 2: [friendly] Here's her letter for you which she revised, [speeding up], forty-seven times according to my records because she wanted every word to, [monotone], convey exactly what she couldn't say in person about how proud she was of, [very excited], who you've become despite everything.
