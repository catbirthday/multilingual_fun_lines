Scenario: A wealthy shipping magnate desperately needs help from a canal operator he once tried to have fired when his teenage daughter falls into dangerous waters only the operator knows how to navigate.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [desperately] Please, you have to help me, my daughter fell off the yacht twenty minutes ago near the spillway and the rescue teams say the current's too strong for them to navigate safely!

Character 2: That's the deepest part of the canal, forty feet down with crosscurrents that change every hour based on the lock schedule. [pause] Why exactly should I risk my neck for you, Mr. Thornton?

Character 1: [shaky voice] Because she's only seventeen and she's all I have left since her mother died, and I know what I did to you was wrong but please, I'm begging you!

Character 2: You tried to have me fired six months ago, said I was too old and slow to run these locks efficiently. [calmly] Now suddenly my thirty years of experience matters when it's your daughter drowning?

Character 1: [crying while speaking] I'll give you anything, money, a new boat, I'll make sure you never have to work another day in your life if you just get in that water right now!

Character 2: Money won't help her if I miscalculate the undertow near marker seven. [firmly] But I'll do it anyway because unlike you, I don't let personal grudges decide who deserves to live or die.

Character 1: [anxious] Thank you, thank God, what do you need from me, should I call for more equipment or get the coast guard to clear the channel for you?

Character 2: Just stay out of my way and let me work. [slowly] The current pulls east for another twelve minutes, then shifts hard west, so if she's conscious she needs to stop fighting it.

Character 1: [very quietly] She's a strong swimmer but the water's so cold and dark down there, and I keep thinking about how scared she must be, not knowing if anyone's coming.

Character 2: Fear's what kills people in these situations, that and exhaustion from fighting physics they don't understand. [pause] Your daughter, she wear bright colors today or is everything designer black like usual?

Character 1: [quickly] Red jacket, she was wearing her college touring jacket from Stanford, bright red with white letters, and her hair's in a ponytail if that helps you spot her!

Character 2: Red's good, easier to spot against the murk. [confidently] I'm going in at the maintenance ladder where the eddy forms, should put me right in the current path she's traveling.

Character 1: [pleading] Please be careful, I know I have no right to ask anything of you but if something happens to you trying to save her, I'll never forgive myself for any of this.

Character 2: Save your guilt for later, we've got work to do. [sternly] When I bring her up, she'll need immediate warming, not your hysterics, so get those thermal blankets ready and clear the dock.

Character 1: [shaky voice] I've already destroyed your career once and now I'm asking you to risk your life for my mistakes, for my negligence in not watching her more carefully on the yacht.

Character 2: Kids fall off boats, it happens, though usually not when their fathers are too busy on conference calls to notice. [sighs] But dwelling on that won't change the next eight minutes.

Character 1: [desperately] I see her! [shouting] There, about fifty meters downstream by the concrete pillar, she's holding onto something but the current keeps pulling at her!

Character 2: That's a maintenance chain, rusted but solid enough to buy us time. [quickly] Stop shouting at her, you'll make her panic and lose her grip, just let me get into position.

Character 1: [whispering] She looks so small from here, just this tiny red spot against all that black water, and I keep thinking how I almost lost you both to my own arrogance.

Character 2: Almost doesn't count in rescue work, only outcomes matter. [firmly] Now step back from the edge before you fall in too, because I'm only making one trip down there today. [pause] Here we go.
