Scenario: A Gen X parent confronts the pharmaceutical researcher who developed the ADHD medication their teenager has been taking, after discovering concerning side effects that weren't disclosed during the trial phase.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [firmly] Dr. Morrison, my daughter has been having seizures for three weeks now, and I just found out from another parent that six kids in your trial experienced the same thing. [shaky voice] You told us the medication was safe.

Character 2: [calmly] Every medication carries some degree of risk, which was outlined in the consent forms you signed. [pause] The seizure incidents affected less than two percent of participants, well within acceptable parameters.

Character 1: [angry] Acceptable parameters? [loudly] My fifteen-year-old can't drive anymore because she might have a seizure behind the wheel! [voice breaking] She was supposed to get her license next month.

Character 2: [confidently] The benefits of improved focus and academic performance far outweigh these rare side effects. [clearing throat] Your daughter's grades improved by thirty percent during the trial period, according to our records.

Character 1: [bitter] Yeah, her grades were great right up until she collapsed in chemistry class and had to be rushed to the emergency room. [sarcastically] Really worth that B+ average now.

Character 2: [defensively] Isolated incidents don't negate years of research.

Character 1: [trembling] You knew about the other kids having seizures during phase two trials, didn't you? [quietly] The woman I spoke to said her son's episodes started six months before mine even enrolled.

Character 2: [hesitantly] The phase two data showed minimal neurological impact, and the FDA approved our continuation based on those findings. [sighs] We adjusted dosages accordingly for phase three.

Character 1: [frustrated] Adjusted dosages? You experimented on our children!

Character 2: [over confidently] We conducted legitimate medical research that will help millions of kids with ADHD achieve their full potential. Your emotional response is understandable but doesn't change the scientific validity of our work.

Character 1: [very quietly] I trusted you people because my brother worked in pharma for twenty years before he died. [bitter] He always said the good researchers put patients first, but you're just another corporate hack pushing pills.

Character 2: [formally] I'm sorry about your brother, but personal attacks won't resolve this situation. [pause] We followed all protocols and regulatory guidelines throughout the trial process.

Character 1: [upset] My daughter wanted to be a pilot, Dr. Morrison. [crying while speaking] Now she can't even get a regular driver's license because of the seizure risk on her medical record.

Character 2: [quietly] The seizures typically subside within three to six months after discontinuation. [reluctantly] There are some cases where they persist longer, but those are extremely rare.

Character 1: [gasps] Some cases persist longer? [furiously] How long? Years? Forever? What aren't you telling us about the long-term effects?

Character 2: [monotone] The longitudinal data is still being collected, but preliminary findings suggest most patients experience full recovery within a year of stopping the medication. [pause] Most patients.

Character 1: [determined] I'm getting every parent from that trial together, and we're going to make sure everyone knows what you did. [firmly] My generation doesn't just roll over when corporations hurt our kids.

Character 2: [condescending] You're welcome to pursue whatever action makes you feel better, but our legal department has dealt with these situations before. [coldly] The consent forms are quite comprehensive.

Character 1: [passionately] You think those forms protect you from what you've done? [laughs bitterly] Wait until the news stations hear about teenage kids having seizures because you withheld safety data.

Character 2: [sternly] I'd be very careful about making unfounded accusations publicly, especially given the non-disclosure agreement you signed. [slowly] Corporate takes these matters quite seriously.
