Scenario: A widow in her penthouse suite encounters the window cleaner who witnessed her husband's fatal fall from the same building six months ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Oh, it's... it's you again. [pause] I wasn't expecting anyone on the windows today, especially not, um, well, not the same person who was here that morning six months ago when everything changed.

Character 2: [carefully] Yeah, I, uh, I rotate through this building every third Thursday, been doing it for eight years now actually. [clearing throat] Management didn't mention you'd be home today, Mrs. Whitmore, or I would've maybe scheduled differently.

Character 1: [bitter] Management doesn't know I'm here half the time anymore, I just sort of drift through these rooms like some kind of, I don't know, expensive ghost. [quietly] Tell me something—do you still think about that morning?

Character 2: [uncomfortable] Look, ma'am, I already told the police everything I saw, which was, um, basically nothing useful since I was facing the other direction when it, uh, when it happened. [pause] Just heard the sound and then all the screaming from the street below.

Character 1: [provoking] Facing the other direction, right, of course you were. [slowly] Funny how everyone was conveniently looking somewhere else when my dear husband decided to take his morning constitutional straight through the bedroom window, isn't it?

Character 2: [defensive] I mean, I was literally cleaning the northwest corner windows, that's just, that's the route I always take, start northwest and work clockwise. [firmly] Been doing it the exact same way since before you folks even moved in here.

Character 1: [sarcastically] How wonderfully methodical of you. [sighs] You know what the really ironic part is? Harold was terrified of heights, wouldn't even go near the edge of our terrace without practically hyperventilating, but somehow he managed to, what did they say, accidentally lean too far out?

Character 2: Ma'am, I really don't think we should be having this conversation, it's not really appropriate for me to—[exhales] look, whatever happened that morning, it's not my place to have opinions about it.

Character 1: [frustrated] Oh please, everyone has opinions, the doorman, the other tenants, probably even you despite your very careful professional distance. [quietly] I just want to know if anyone else finds it as impossibly absurd as I do.

Character 2: [carefully] What I find absurd is that they never fixed that window latch properly, even after I reported it being loose three times in the months before. [pause] But hey, apparently that wasn't relevant to anybody's investigation either.

Character 1: [shocked] The latch was... wait, you reported the latch? [shaky voice] Nobody ever mentioned anything about a faulty latch, they said Harold must have unlocked it himself, that was the whole basis for their conclusion about what happened.

Character 2: [reluctantly] Yeah well, I sent the work orders to building maintenance, not to, um, not to individual tenants, so maybe it never made it up the chain. [quietly] Though funny how after the accident, that particular window got completely replaced within two days.

Character 1: [anxiously] Jesus Christ, are you... are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting? Because I've been going crazy for six months wondering how a man who needed three drinks just to stand on our balcony suddenly decided to open a window and lean out.

Character 2: [evenly] I'm not suggesting anything, ma'am, I'm just a window cleaner who knows that sometimes windows fail and sometimes that timing is, uh, unfortunate. [pause] But I also know that work order copies tend to disappear when buildings have liability concerns.

Character 1: [urgently] Do you still have those work orders, the copies? [trembling] Please tell me you kept copies because I need to know if this was... if Harold's death was actually preventable, if someone knew and just didn't care enough to fix it.

Character 2: [hesitantly] I might have, um, a habit of keeping my own records, yeah, just to cover myself when rich folks claim I damaged something. [quietly] But showing them to you would probably cost me this job and every other building this management company runs.

Character 1: [desperately] I have more money than I could spend in three lifetimes and absolutely nothing left to lose. [firmly] Whatever your job pays for a year, I'll triple it right now if you just tell me the truth about what you know.

Character 2: [long pause] The truth is that window had been getting worse for months, needed a complete replacement, not patches. [very quietly] And the morning your husband fell, I noticed fresh tool marks on the frame, like someone had been messing with it the night before.

Character 1: [whispering] Oh my God. [shaky voice] Harold's business partner had a key, he was here for dinner the night before, said he forgot his coat and came back alone while I was in the bath... Oh my God, what do I do with this?

Character 2: [firmly] What you do is you be very, very careful who you trust, Mrs. Whitmore, because if I noticed those tool marks, maybe someone else did too and chose to stay quiet. [pause] I'll leave those work orders in your mailbox tomorrow, then I'm requesting a transfer to a different route.
