            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[uncomfortable] Look, ma'am, I already told the police everything I saw, which was, um, basically nothing useful since I was facing the other direction when it, uh, when it happened. [pause] Just heard the sound and then all the screaming from the street below."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[provoking] Facing the other direction, right, of course you were. [slowly] Funny how everyone was conveniently looking somewhere else when my dear husband decided to take his morning constitutional straight through the bedroom window, isn't it?"

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[defensive] I mean, I was literally cleaning the northwest corner windows, that's just, that's the route I always take, start northwest and work clockwise. [firmly] Been doing it the exact same way since before you folks even moved in here."

Harold was terrified of heights, wouldn't even go near the edge of our terrace without practically hyperventilating, but somehow he managed to, what did they say, accidentally lean too far out?"

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[carefully] What I find absurd is that they never fixed that window latch properly, even after I reported it being loose three times in the months before. [pause] But hey, apparently that wasn't relevant to anybody's investigation either."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[shocked] The latch was... wait, you reported the latch? [shaky voice] Nobody ever mentioned anything about a faulty latch, they said Harold must have unlocked it himself, that was the whole basis for their conclusion about what happened."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[reluctantly] Yeah well, I sent the work orders to building maintenance, not to, um, not to individual tenants, so maybe it never made it up the chain. [quietly] Though funny how after the accident, that particular window got completely replaced within two days."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[anxiously] Jesus Christ, are you... are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting? Because I've been going crazy for six months wondering how a man who needed three drinks just to stand on our balcony suddenly decided to open a window and lean out."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[evenly] I'm not suggesting anything, ma'am, I'm just a window cleaner who knows that sometimes windows fail and sometimes that timing is, uh, unfortunate. [pause] But I also know that work order copies tend to disappear when buildings have liability concerns."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[urgently] Do you still have those work orders, the copies? [trembling] Please tell me you kept copies because I need to know if this was... if Harold's death was actually preventable, if someone knew and just didn't care enough to fix it."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[hesitantly] I might have, um, a habit of keeping my own records, yeah, just to cover myself when rich folks claim I damaged something. [quietly] But showing them to you would probably cost me this job and every other building this management company runs."

            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",

[pause] I'll leave those work orders in your mailbox tomorrow, then I'm requesting a transfer to a different route."
