=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] I specifically requested a different engineer but they sent, [shaky voice], you of all people to handle tomorrow's wedding broadcast.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, I know this is, um, [awkward], incredibly uncomfortable but I'm the only one available who knows this venue's, well, [quietly], technical requirements inside out. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] You're seriously going to stand there and pretend like you didn't, [angry], leave me waiting in my wedding dress while three hundred guests, [trembling], watched me fall apart.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] That day haunts me more than you could, [whispering], possibly imagine and seeing you now planning someone else's perfect day is, [slowly], killing me inside.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Don't you dare make this about your pain when you're the one who, [loudly], ran away without even a text message. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] I had a panic attack, okay, I mean, [crying while speaking], I literally couldn't breathe and by the time I could think straight it was, well, [trailing off], too late to fix anything.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] So you just disappeared for five years instead of, [exhausted], trying to explain or apologize even once? [groan]

Character 2 [en]: Every single day, um, I picked up my phone to call you but, [anxious], what could I possibly say that would undo the, er, [very sad], humiliation I caused you?

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Anything would've helped!

Character 2 [en]: I know that now.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] You know, um, the worst part wasn't even the embarrassment, it was, [very quietly], spending years wondering if I'd done something wrong or if you'd, well, [passionately], ever actually loved me at all.

Character 2 [en]: Of course I loved you—that's exactly why I, [warm], panicked because I knew I'd never be good enough for someone who, [sincerely], deserved the absolute world.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] That wasn't your decision to make, I mean, [stern], you took away my choice by deciding for both of us that we shouldn't, umm, [speeding up], be together. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] You're right, and um, I've spent five years in therapy trying to, well, [carefully], understand why I self-sabotage everything good in my life, especially, you know, [monotone], us. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Well, therapy or not, um, tomorrow you're going to, [confidently], broadcast a beautiful wedding without any drama because that's what my clients deserve, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [playful] I can be professional if you can, though I have to say, um, [flirtatious], you've only gotten more beautiful when you're angry, and well, [whispering loudly], you were already stunning five years ago. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [mocking] Please tell me you're not actually trying to flirt with me right now after, er, [very melancholic], everything we've been through, because that would be, like, [shouting], completely insane even for you.

Character 2 [en]: [shy] No, I'm just, well, [stuttering], st-stating a fact while also acknowledging that I have absolutely no right to, um, [deep pitch], say anything personal to you anymore, you know. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Well, um, just don't.

Character 2 [en]: After tomorrow's wedding is over, maybe we could, [hopeful], actually talk somewhere that isn't a vendor prep room with, [nervously], terrible fluorescent lighting making everything feel even more surreal.
