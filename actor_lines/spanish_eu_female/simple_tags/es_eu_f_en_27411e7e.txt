=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The financial records you provided show, [confused], shell companies dating back to 1847, which is, [stern], impossible unless this is some kind of elaborate fraud. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [dismissive] Well, um, your limited perspective on what's possible is, [amused], exactly why I usually work through, er, intermediaries who don't ask, [condescending], such tiresome questions about documentation. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [curious] These investment patterns show you've funded every major technological breakthrough, [shocked], from the telegraph to artificial intelligence, consistently picking, [excited], winners decades before anyone else saw potential.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] When you've watched humanity stumble through the same mistakes for, [very quietly], centuries, well, patterns become rather obvious.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So, um, you're actually claiming to be, well, what exactly—some kind of, er, immortal being who's been, [shaky voice], manipulating human progress?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Manipulating is such an ugly word when I've merely been, [empathetically], nudging civilization away from its worst impulses and toward, [passionate], something resembling enlightenment.

Character 1 [en]: This changes everything about our deal because, [frustrated], I can't exactly present an immortal being to my board as, [loudly], a legitimate investor without them thinking, [anxious], I've completely lost my mind. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: Your board sees, um, what I allow them to see, just as, [monotone], every institution I've worked with for the past, well, three hundred years has seen, [formal], precisely what they needed to see.

Character 1 [en]: The arrogance in assuming you can just, [angry], control information and manipulate people across, [shouting], centuries without consequences is exactly the kind of, [trembling], god complex I should have expected.

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Consequences are for those who live brief lives and, [regretful], never see the full arc of their choices play out across, [slowly], generations of suffering and triumph.

Character 1 [en]: But, um, if you're really immortal, then why would you, er, even need our company's technology when you've seen, [desperately], everything already and, well, [whispering], nothing could surprise you anymore? [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Because watching humanity create something genuinely new, [delighted], something I haven't seen in all my years, is the only thing that makes, [melancholic], eternity bearable. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You're using us as entertainment, [disgusted], playing with people's lives and dreams just to feel, [bored], something after all your centuries of existence.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Um, well, entertainment? [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Despite everything you've seen and done, you still need us, [mocking], still depend on human innovation and creativity to give your endless existence, [triumphant], meaning and purpose. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, er, perhaps I've been too, [honest], dismissive of your concerns. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [coldly] Just tell me.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Every century I tell myself this will be the last time I, [crying while speaking], interfere with human affairs, but then I see potential like yours and, [hopeful], I can't help but reach out once more. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: Maybe that's the real curse of immortality—not boredom but, [sympathetic], the inability to let go of a world that keeps, er, I mean, moving forward without you, even as you, [sad], try to guide it.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] You know, um, in four centuries, you're the first person to, [grateful], understand that distinction, which is, well, [warmly], precisely why I chose your company to invest in. [smile]
