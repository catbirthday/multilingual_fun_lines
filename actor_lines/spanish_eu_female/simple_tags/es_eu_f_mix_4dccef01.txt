=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: I never expected to see, [shaky voice], a nadie conocido en esta terminal de carga después de estar fuera, [quietly], 20 años. [long pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [hesitantly] Wait, um, is that really you standing there with, [shocked], todas esas etiquetas de equipaje de lugares que solo he visto en revistas, quiero decir, lugares con los que solíamos soñar?

Character 1 [mix]: [warm] God, um, Sarah, todavía tienes esa misma forma de inclinar la cabeza cuando estás, [confused], sorprendida, como, sabes, nada ha cambiado aunque todo ha cambiado.

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] Everything did change when you left for that, [trailing off], beca de periodismo en Praga y nunca volviste. [sigh]

Character 1 [mix]: [regretful] Well, um, one assignment led to another and suddenly, [apologetic], estaba cubriendo guerras en lugares que ni siquiera podía pronunciar mientras tú estabas, eh, [very quietly], viviendo la vida que habíamos planeado juntas. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Actually, um, I got my forklift certification about six months after you left because, bueno, [frustrated], servir mesas no pagaba las facturas médicas de mamá y alguien tenía que, [firmly], quedarse.

Character 1 [mix]: [anxious] Your mother's illness wasn't something I could have, [guilty], predicho cuando cogí esa beca pero debería haber, [whispering], vuelto cuando me enteré, debería haber estado aquí para ti de alguna manera. [pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [slowly] You know, er, I used to watch planes take off from this terminal during my breaks, um, [melancholic], preguntándome en cuál podrías estar tú, si alguna vez pensabas en, [wistfully], este lugar o las promesas que hicimos junto al viejo embalse, bueno, antes de que todo se viniera abajo.

Character 1 [mix]: [passionately] Sarah, um, I thought about you in every city I visited, eh, comparaba cada puesta de sol con las que veíamos desde, [nostalgic], la parte de atrás de la camioneta de tu padre.

Character 2 [mix]: [curious] So why didn't you ever write or call or send even, [hurt], una postal de todos esos lugares exóticos?

Character 1 [mix]: [ashamed] Because I was, [trembling], una cobarde. [cry]

Character 2 [mix]: [empathetically] Maybe we were both cowards in our own ways because I could have, [honestly], te podría haber encontrado si realmente lo hubiera intentado pero mantenerme enfadada era, [exhausted], más fácil que admitir que todavía te amaba. [deep sigh]

Character 1 [mix]: [hopefully] Look, um, I know twenty years is a lifetime and you probably have a family now but, eh, [nervously], ¿podríamos quizás tomar un café cuando termine tu turno, solo para, bueno, [eagerly], hablar sobre en quién nos hemos convertido?

Character 2 [mix]: [thoughtful] Well, um, there's no family actually, solo yo y esta carretilla elevadora y, eh, [laughing sadly], un estudio que todavía tiene esa foto de la graduación donde estamos, [smiling], planeando conquistar el mundo juntas.

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] You kept that photo after everything I put you through, [moved], después de todo el silencio y la distancia? [sniffle]

Character 2 [mix]: Some things you can't throw away even when they, [painfully], duelen al mirarlas porque te recuerdan cuando la vida todavía se sentía, [dreamily], infinita.

Character 1 [mix]: [tearfully] Jesus, [choked up], Sarah.

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] The coffee shop by the departure gates stays open all night if you want to, [inviting], contarme sobre esos 20 años de puestas de sol que no fueron nuestras.

Character 1 [mix]: [relieved] I have, um, six hours before my connection to Seattle but honestly, bueno, [decided], puede que simplemente pierda ese vuelo.

Character 2 [mix]: [softly] Don't make promises you can't keep this time because my heart's too old for, [vulnerable], ese tipo de ruptura otra vez aunque verte aquí hace que se sienta, [hopefully], 20 años más joven. [whisper]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: I never expected to see, [shaky voice], anyone I knew at this cargo terminal after being gone for, [quietly], twenty years. [long pause]

Character 2: [hesitantly] Wait, um, is that really you standing there with, [shocked], all those luggage tags from places I've only seen in magazines, I mean, places we used to dream about?

Character 1: [warm] God, um, Sarah, you still have that same way of tilting your head when you're, [confused], surprised, like, you know, nothing's changed at all even though everything has.

Character 2: [bitter] Everything did change when you left for that, [trailing off], journalism fellowship in Prague and never came back. [sigh]

Character 1: [regretful] Well, um, one assignment led to another and suddenly, [apologetic], I was covering wars in places I couldn't even pronounce while you were, er, [very quietly], living the life we'd planned together. [gasp softly]

Character 2: [defensive] Actually, um, I got my forklift certification about six months after you left because, well, [frustrated], waiting tables wasn't paying Mom's medical bills and someone had to, [firmly], stay.

Character 1: [anxious] Your mother's illness wasn't something I could have, [guilty], predicted when I took that fellowship but I should have, [whispering], come back when I heard, should have been here for you somehow. [pause]

Character 2: [slowly] You know, er, I used to watch planes take off from this terminal during my breaks, um, [melancholic], wondering which one you might be on, whether you ever thought about, [wistfully], this place or the promises we made by the old reservoir, well, before everything fell apart.

Character 1: [passionately] Sarah, um, I thought about you in every city I visited, er, compared every sunset to the ones we watched from, [nostalgic], your dad's truck bed.

Character 2: [curious] So why didn't you ever write or call or send even, [hurt], one postcard from all those exotic places?

Character 1: [ashamed] Because I was, [trembling], a coward. [cry]

Character 2: [empathetically] Maybe we were both cowards in our own ways because I could have, [honestly], found you if I'd really tried but staying angry was, [exhausted], easier than admitting I still loved you. [deep sigh]

Character 1: [hopefully] Look, um, I know twenty years is a lifetime and you probably have a family now but, er, [nervously], could we maybe get coffee when your shift ends, just to, well, [eagerly], talk about who we became?

Character 2: [thoughtful] Well, um, there's no family actually, just me and this forklift and, er, [laughing sadly], a studio apartment that still has that photo from graduation where we're, [smiling], planning to conquer the world together.

Character 1: [surprised] You kept that photo after everything I put you through, [moved], after all the silence and distance? [sniffle]

Character 2: Some things you can't throw away even when they, [painfully], hurt to look at because they remind you of when life still felt, [dreamily], infinite.

Character 1: [tearfully] Jesus, [choked up], Sarah.

Character 2: [gently] The coffee shop by the departure gates stays open all night if you want to, [inviting], tell me about those twenty years of sunsets that weren't ours.

Character 1: [relieved] I have, um, six hours before my connection to Seattle but honestly, well, [decided], I might just miss that flight.

Character 2: [softly] Don't make promises you can't keep this time because my heart's too old for, [vulnerable], that kind of breaking again even though seeing you here makes it feel, [hopefully], twenty years younger. [whisper]
