=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] The vacuum's in the west wing, third door on the left, though I suppose you'll need help finding it since the hallways all look rather similar these days.

Character 2 [en]: [professionally] I've got the work order here for a 1952 Hoover Constellation, says it needs a motor rebuild and new seals. [pause] This place is bigger than I expected from the address.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Yes, well, it used to house quite a large family once upon a time. [clearing throat] Now it's just me rattling around in all these empty rooms, trying to keep things running.

Character 2 [en]: Funny thing about old vacuums, they outlast their owners sometimes, keep working long after everything else falls apart around them.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] That particular vacuum belonged to your mother actually. [long pause] She insisted on doing the cleaning herself even after we could afford staff.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] My mother? [very quietly] How would you know anything about my mother, she never mentioned living anywhere like this.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Because I'm your father, Daniel. [sighs] The one who left when you were seven and never came back.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] You're lying, my father died years ago, that's what Mom told us. [frustrated] Some old man in a crumbling house doesn't get to claim he's my dead father. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] The scar on your left palm from when you tried to fix my pocket watch and the spring cut you. [pause] You were always taking things apart to see how they worked.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] That doesn't prove anything, lots of kids have scars, lots of kids liked fixing things. [quieter] Why would you leave us and then call me here thirty years later?

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I didn't call you here on purpose, I just needed the vacuum fixed and yours was the only shop still servicing vintage models. [sighs] Perhaps fate has a sense of irony.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Fate? You think fate brought me to this decaying monument to your selfishness? [loudly] We lived in a two-bedroom apartment while you sat in your manor! [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I know.

Character 2 [en]: [whisperning] Just tell me why.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] Your grandfather threatened to disinherit everything if I married beneath the family name. [pause] I was young and weak and chose money over love, over you.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Mom never said anything bad about you, even when we couldn't afford groceries some weeks. [sniffles] She just said you had your reasons and we should focus on moving forward.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] She was always kinder than I deserved, your mother. [very quietly] I've regretted my choice every single day since, watching this place rot around me like my conscience. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [forgiving] The vacuum's motor is shot but I can rebuild it with parts from my shop. [gently] It'll take a few visits to get it running properly again, if that's alright with you.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] I'd like that very much, Daniel. [warmly] Perhaps we could have tea while you work, and you could tell me about your life, about who you became. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Tea sounds good, and maybe you could tell me about her, about the parts of her life I never knew, before she met you and after you left.
