Character 1 [en]: So, um, I've been reading this book about, like, grit and perseverance, you know, but I'm kind of struggling with it.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I'm so sorry you're finding it challenging! I actually, [warm], found that book quite dense myself when I first read it—the thing is, the author sometimes gets a bit academic, which I really should have warned you about.

Character 1 [en]: No worries, I just wonder if I'm missing something important.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I'm terribly sorry if I, err, oversold it to you—basically, the core message about passion and perseverance is valuable, but, you know, I realize now I should have mentioned it can be a bit repetitive.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, the repetition is, uh, what's getting to me—I mean, how many times can they, honestly, say the same thing?

Character 2 [en]: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not giving you a heads up about that! The author does tend to hammer the same points home over and over—I should have suggested just reading the first few chapters and the conclusion.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, [delighted], you mean I can skip the middle parts?

Character 2 [en]: Oh definitely, and I'm, like, [flirtatious] so sorry I didn't mention that earlier—the thing is, most of the good stuff is front-loaded, and, well, the rest is just examples that honestly repeat the same concepts.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, that's, er, actually really helpful to know—so, which chapters specifically would you, um, recommend?

Character 2 [en]: I'd say chapters one through three, then jump to chapter eight—again, my apologies for not being clearer about this structure when I first recommended it to you!

Character 1 [en]: You know, I've been feeling, basically, pretty guilty about not finishing it, but, uhh, this makes me feel better.

Character 2 [en]: Oh please don't feel guilty at all! I mean, [over confidently], I've read hundreds of these books and most of them could be articles—sorry if that sounds dismissive, but it's true and I should have been more upfront about it.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, what's your take on the whole, like, grit concept anyway—I mean, do you actually buy into it?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I think there's value in understanding that, you know, talent isn't everything—but honestly, I'm sorry to say the book oversimplifies things, and, err, it doesn't really account for systemic barriers that people face.

Character 1 [en]: Right so, it's not just about, uhh, trying harder then—that's kind of, actually, what I was sensing.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly, and I apologize if my recommendation made it seem like I, hmm, fully endorsed that view—the thing is, success is way more complex than just having grit, and, basically, I should have been clearer about the book's limitations.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, this conversation is, er, more helpful than the book itself—you know, hearing your honest take on it.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I'm so glad, though I do feel bad that you've, well, already spent time on it—honestly, maybe I should start giving, um, more nuanced book recommendations with caveats included!

Character 1 [en]: Any other books on achievement that might be better?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly, most of them have similar issues, and I hate to [condescending] burst your bubble, but the self-help genre tends to oversimplify complex social phenomena—sorry, but you might be better off reading actual psychology research papers if you want the real insights!
