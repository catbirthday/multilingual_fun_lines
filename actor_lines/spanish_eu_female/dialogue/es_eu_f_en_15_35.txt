Character 1 [en]: So, um, I've been thinking about what you said, you know, about us taking a break, but honestly, I don't understand why.

Character 2 [en]: Well, it's just that we've been going in circles for months now, er, and I keep hoping things will change but they don't... I need you to understand that this isn't about not loving you anymore.

Character 1 [en]: You're still wearing the [yawn] necklace I gave you though.

Character 2 [en]: I know, I— I can't seem to take it off yet. It's complicated, and maybe that's unfair to both of us, but some habits are harder to break than others...

Character 1 [en]: Remember when we [laugh loudly] got caught in that thunderstorm on our first date?

Character 2 [en]: Of course I remember, I mean, how could I [sarcastic] forget getting completely drenched, you know, but the thing is, those magical moments aren't enough anymore... we need more than just good memories to sustain this.

Character 1 [en]: So you're [clearing throat] really done trying?

Character 2 [en]: I'm not— look, basically, I'm exhausted from trying so hard when, uh, it feels like I'm the only one fighting for us... Can't you see how much this is breaking me too?

Character 1 [en]: Actually, I've been, er, seeing a therapist about my issues, like, the ones you mentioned, you know?

Character 2 [en]: That's— that's wonderful, really, and I'm proud of you for taking that step, but I need you to do it for yourself, not just to win me back...

Character 1 [en]: But we were planning that trip to Portugal next month.

Character 2 [en]: I know we were [slurring] planning things, and part of me still wants to go, but we can't keep using future plans as bandaids for present problems... it's not fair to either of us.

Character 1 [en]: Your sister said you've been crying at work.

Character 2 [en]: She shouldn't have— yes, I've been struggling, because walking away from someone you love is impossibly hard, even when you know it's the right thing to do...

Character 1 [en]: What if I change? What if I really change this time?

Character 2 [en]: You've promised to, um, change before, and I be-[stuttering]-believe you mean it, really, but I guess actions need to come before promises now... I can't keep waiting and hoping while nothing actually shifts.

Character 1 [en]: I don't want to lose you.

Character 2 [en]: And I don't want to lose you either, honestly, but sometimes, well, loving someone means letting them go when the relationship is hurting both of you... Please understand I'm not trying to punish you.

Character 1 [en]: So, uh, this is really it then, I mean, we're actually done?

Character 2 [en]: Maybe not forever, you know, but for now— yes, we need this space to, um, figure out who we are without each other... and maybe that's the only way we'll ever find our way back.
