Character 1 [en]: So you've been doing makeup for how long now?

Character 2 [en]: [cough] Oh gosh, um, fifteen years? Yeah, fifteen years this month actually. Started when I was, let's see, nineteen? Right out of cosmetology school, just completely terrified but so, so ready to make people feel beautiful.

Character 1 [en]: [friendly] That's amazing! Do you still love it?

Character 2 [en]: Love it? Mmm, that's—okay so, it's complicated. Some days I wake up and I'm like, yes, this is my calling, I'm literally changing how people see themselves in the mirror. Other days though, jeez, it's exhausting.

Character 1 [en]: What makes it exhausting?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Well, between you and me? It's when people don't trust the process. They come in with this image that's, I mean, completely wrong for their face shape, their coloring, everything, but they insist, you know?

Character 1 [en]: I bet you see some interesting requests.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, interesting doesn't even begin to cover it. Last week, right, this woman brought in a photo of Zendaya and demanded—not asked, demanded—that exact look. Different skin tone, different face structure, different everything, but she was convinced.

Character 1 [en]: How did you handle that?

Character 2 [en]: [speeding up] So what I do is, I start with their vision but then I gradually, gradually shift it toward what actually works, and usually by the end they're like "oh my god this is even better than what I wanted" and they don't even realize I basically ignored their original request.

Character 1 [en]: That's pretty clever actually.

Character 2 [en]: It's not about being clever though, it's about, hmm, how do I put this? It's about seeing who they really are underneath all their insecurities and, like, bringing that person to the surface.

Character 1 [en]: You make it sound almost spiritual.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely.

Character 1 [en]: Really?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I mean, think about it—when someone sits in my chair, they're vulnerable, right? Eyes closed, trusting me completely with their face, their image, essentially their armor for facing the world. That's, that's sacred to me.

Character 1 [en]: I never thought about it that way.

Character 2 [en]: Most people don't, but honestly? Every brushstroke is, um, it's like painting confidence directly onto someone's soul. Sounds cheesy maybe, but I've seen people literally transform, not just their face but their whole, their whole energy shifts.

Character 1 [en]: You really care about this.

Character 2 [en]: [laugh loudly] Care about it? Oh honey, this isn't just my job, it's my entire life's mission. Making people see their own beauty? That's, jeez, that's everything to me. Everything.
