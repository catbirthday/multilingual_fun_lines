Character 1 [en]: Sorry, what? I was reading about that OpenAI situation with Sam Altman.

Character 2 [en]: I was saying how strange it is that we spend so much time analyzing everyone else's motivations but rarely examine our own. Like how people dissect every move Elon Musk makes but can't explain why they scrolled Twitter for three hours.

Character 1 [en]: Right, right. Did you see what happened with Meta's new VR thing?

Character 2 [en]: [bored] You're literally proving my point right now. We're talking about self-awareness and you're bouncing between Silicon Valley headlines like a pinball. When's the last time you actually sat with your own thoughts without checking Reuters or Bloomberg?

Character 1 [en]: I'm listening. Self-awareness. Got it.

Character 2 [en]: The ancient Greeks had it right with "know thyself" carved into the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. But now we know every detail about Taylor Swift's relationship timeline while having no idea why we feel anxious on Sunday nights.

Character 1 [en]: Speaking of, did you catch her show at Madison Square Garden?

Character 2 [en]: See, this is exactly what David Foster Wallace talked about in his Kenyon College speech. We're all so locked in our default settings that we can't even recognize when we're doing it. You're aware I'm talking about awareness, but you're not aware you're not aware.

Character 1 [en]: [playful] Very meta. Like that Black Mirror episode on Netflix.

Character 2 [en]: Actually yes, Charlie Brooker gets it. We're so busy consuming content about consciousness and humanity that we forget to actually experience being human. It's like reading every review of The French Laundry but never actually tasting food.

Character 1 [en]: Thomas Keller's place? I've been meaning to get a reservation.

Character 2 [en]: This is almost performance art at this point. Here we are discussing self-examination while you're mentally shopping on OpenTable. It's like when Socrates tried to teach the youth of Athens and they kept asking about the Olympics.

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] I know I'm doing it. I can't help it.

Character 2 [en]: That's the first real thing you've said. Most people can't even admit they're on autopilot. Warren Buffett talks about this with investing - everyone knows what to do, but knowing and doing are universes apart.

Character 1 [en]: [cough] My therapist says the same thing.

Character 2 [en]: [belly laugh] Of course you have a therapist! Let me guess, somewhere in Beverly Hills or the Upper West Side? Even self-improvement becomes another thing to consume rather than practice. We outsource our inner work like everything else.

Character 1 [en]: She's actually in Palo Alto. Near Stanford.

Character 2 [en]: The irony is beautiful. You're in the epicenter of companies designed to fragment attention - Google, Facebook, Apple all within miles - trying to piece yours back together. It's like going to Las Vegas for a meditation retreat.

Character 1 [en]: When you put it that way, it does sound absurd.

Character 2 [en]: Absurd is the human condition, friend. Albert Camus would've loved this conversation. We know exactly what's wrong with us, we pay people to confirm it, then we go right back to scrolling through The New York Times while our lives tick by.
