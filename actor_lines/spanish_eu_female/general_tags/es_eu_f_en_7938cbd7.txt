=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [warm] So, um, I got your message about wanting to, [careful], discuss your ancestry trip to Romania and, well, I thought we should, [hesitant], meet in person rather than, you know, just exchange emails about it.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Yes, I've been planning this, [thrilled], heritage journey for three years now since my grandmother passed. [laughs]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] That's wonderful that you're finally, [concealing worry], making this connection to your roots and I know how much this, [strained], means to you after everything.

Character 2 [en]: [enthusiastic] I've already mapped out the villages where my, [proud], great-grandparents lived and found a local guide who speaks the, [animated], dialect they would have used.

Character 1 [en]: Have you considered maybe, [nervous], postponing the trip for a few months?

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Why would I postpone when I've already, [suspicious], booked everything and taken time off work for the first time in, [defensive], five years? [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [evasive] Well, um, it's just that sometimes these heritage trips can be, [uncomfortable], emotionally overwhelming and, you know, maybe you should, [trailing], prepare more thoroughly first. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: Um, Sarah, you're acting really, [concerned], strange right now and I mean, this isn't like you to be so, [worried], hesitant about travel plans when you're usually, well, the one encouraging me to, [uneasy], explore my roots.

Character 1 [en]: [forced cheerful] Oh, I mean, I'm absolutely supportive of your journey and, um, it's just that, [struggling], sometimes when we dig into family history we find things that are, well, [careful], unexpected.

Character 2 [en]: [direct] There's something you're not, [accusatory], telling me about those genetic test results I had you, [demanding], analyze for the trip insurance, something you discovered that's, [fearful], making you act this way. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] The genetic markers show a, [reluctant], hereditary condition.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] A condition that what, [trembling], changes everything about who I thought I was or where I, [breaking], came from? [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [compassionate] Um, it doesn't change who you are but, well, it might change how you, [gentle], approach certain aspects of your trip and, you know, the medical facilities you'd want to, [protective], have access to. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Just tell me the truth about what you, [pleading], found in my DNA because this dancing around it is, [angry], killing me.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, the markers indicate a rare neurological condition that, uh, typically manifests in your, [heavy], forties and your family in Romania might have, you know, [careful], hidden records about it. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [hollow] So this heritage trip isn't just about finding my, [bitter], roots anymore but about discovering what my family knew and, [defeated], never told us. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [supportive] Whatever you discover there won't define your, [reassuring], future because we have treatments now that didn't exist when your, [hopeful], ancestors faced this, and I'll help you through, [emotional], every step of this journey. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: Um, I guess I need to, well, [overwhelmed], rethink everything about this trip now. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: You don't have to face this, um, [tender], alone anymore.

Character 2 [en]: I know, and, um, maybe that's the only, [grateful], thing keeping me together right now.
