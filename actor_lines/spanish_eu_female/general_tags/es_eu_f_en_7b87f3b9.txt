Scenario: A score mixer and technical animator meet in an empty studio at 3 AM after months of grueling overtime on a project that just got cancelled without warning.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] Seven months of my life just got, [exhausted], deleted in a conference call while I was literally, [breaking], still mixing the final battle sequence that no one will ever, [bitter], hear.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] I had three hundred hours of, [numb], motion capture data that I was cleaning frame by frame and now it's all just, [defeated], worthless files on a server they'll probably, [tired], wipe next week. [sighs]

Character 3 [en]: The worst part is how, [empty], calm I feel about it like I'm too tired to even, [drained], be properly angry anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [weary] My ears are still ringing from the, [monotone], eighteen-hour session yesterday where I balanced every single instrument for a scene that's now, [hollow], completely meaningless and I can't even bring myself to, [exhausted], care. [laughs emptily]

Character 2 [en]: [tired] You know, um, I keep thinking about how I missed my daughter's, [breaking], birthday last month because I was, well, rigging that dragon's wing membranes that nobody will ever, [bitter], see move, and I mean, for what?

Character 1 [en]: [steady] The studio sent an email saying we should be, [mechanical], proud of our dedication and that this experience will make us, [flat], stronger professionals but I just stared at it feeling absolutely, [empty], nothing.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] I watched you through the window last night at, [quiet], four AM still adjusting reverb levels with your head in your hands and I thought we were both, [exhausted], killing ourselves for something that at least, [hollow], mattered.

Character 1 [en]: [muted] Yeah well, I guess we were just, [drained], expensive hamsters on very sophisticated wheels, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Um, pretty much.

Character 1 [en]: [flat] My wife asked me this morning if I was okay and, well, I couldn't even explain why I felt so, [empty], hollow inside, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I mean, same.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] The ironic thing is that I actually think the score was some of my best work but, um, now it'll just sit on a hard drive somewhere forever, [hollow], unheard. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [tired] I spent, um, three weeks just on the facial animations for the protagonist's death scene and, well, I kept tweaking every micro-expression until it was, [broken], perfect for absolutely no reason.

Character 1 [en]: [monotone] They're offering us positions on the next project but, I mean, honestly I don't know if I have another one of these marathons in me, you know, like my soul feels, [depleted], permanently damaged somehow.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] I've been sitting here for two hours just staring at my, [numb], workstation unable to even clean up my files.

Character 1 [en]: [weary] The sound library I built specifically for this project has over, [mechanical], eight thousand custom samples that are now basically, [empty], digital fossils. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Remember when we were, um, excited about this project and how we stayed late those first weeks because we actually wanted to, well, not because we, [bitter], had to? [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [steady] That feels like it happened to completely different, [hollow], people who still believed that working yourself to death meant, [tired], something.

Character 2 [en]: At least we both understand what it's like to pour everything into, [broken], something that disappears overnight like it never even, [empty], existed.

Character 1 [en]: Yeah, I suppose there's, um, something oddly comforting about sharing this particular kind of, well, professional grief with someone who actually, [understanding], gets it. [sighs softly]
