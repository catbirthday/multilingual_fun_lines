=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] The company said they were sending their best, [disbelief], technician but I didn't expect—God, [voice breaking], Sarah, is that really you standing on, [shaky], my dock after twelve years?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I didn't know this was your boat when I took the job, I mean, [tense], they just said urgent GPS repair at slip forty-seven and, well, [uncomfortable], I need the overtime so, uh, maybe we should just keep this professional.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Professional? Well, um, that's rich coming from someone who left without even, [hurt], saying goodbye, just a note on the kitchen table saying you couldn't, [voice cracking], watch me kill myself with this life anymore, I mean, [hollow], those exact words. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: Um, Dad, I was eighteen and watching you come home, [pained], broken and drunk every night after losing another crew member to the sea, well, it was killing me too, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] But you became an engineer, you fix, [proud despite himself], machines that fly thirty thousand feet in the air, and you never once, [wounded], thought to call and tell me you were okay. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Every time I tried to dial your number, I'd remember, [haunted], finding you passed out on the dock that morning.

Character 1 [en]: [rushing] Listen, the season starts in three days and if this GPS isn't fixed, [urgent], I can't find my traps, can't make my mortgage, can't keep the only, [desperate], thing I have left of our family's legacy afloat—literally, [breaking], everything depends on these next few hours.

Character 2 [en]: [professional] Well, um, the mainboard is completely fried from salt corrosion, but I mean, [focused], I might have a workaround using components from the backup system if, uh, [determined], you have the old Furuno unit still installed somewhere. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You remember the Furuno? You were just, [emotional], ten years old when we installed that together, back when you said you wanted to, [wistful], be a fisherman like me and grandpa. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [softening] Of course I remember—you taught me how to, [nostalgic], splice wires and read circuit diagrams right here in this wheelhouse, said, [gentle], even lobstermen needed to understand their electronics.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Those Saturdays we spent rebuilding engines and fixing radars were the only, [meaningful], times I felt like I was doing something right as a father, before, [regretful], everything went to hell. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [working while talking] Um, you know, I use those same troubleshooting techniques you taught me on, well, [revealing], Boeing 737 navigation systems now, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [amazed] Boeing? My little girl who used to get seasick in the harbor is now, [proud], fixing planes that carry hundreds of people across oceans—that's, [overwhelmed], that's something I never could have imagined when you were helping me bait traps, [choked up], covered in herring guts and laughing. [sniffles]

Character 2 [en]: Well, Dad, um, the thing is, I never really left the water behind, I mean, [confessing], I just found a way to be above it instead of on it, you know? [pause]

Character 1 [en]: The GPS is starting to show coordinates again—you're still, [grateful], brilliant with electronics, just like when you rewired our Christmas lights at eight years old. [emotional pause]

Character 2 [en]: [tears starting] I can fix it.

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] Um, Sarah, I know we can't fix twelve years in an afternoon, but, well, [vulnerable], maybe after the season, we could try? [hesitant]

Character 2 [en]: [crying] You know, um, I've been living twenty minutes away in Portland for, well, [revealing], three years now, driving past the harbor every morning and, uh, [confession], wondering if you still named your traps the same way. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] Um, trap number forty-seven is still marked S.B. for Sarah's Birthday—I've repainted, well, [tender], those letters every spring since you left because, um, [breaking down], I couldn't let that piece of you disappear from my life too.

Character 2 [en]: [sobbing] Dad, I'm so sorry I left you alone with all of this, I mean, [desperate], the boat, the business, the grief—I was just, um, [anguished], so scared of losing you to the sea like we lost Mom that I, well, [realization], ended up losing you anyway. [breaks down]
