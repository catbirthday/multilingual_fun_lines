=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] You look exactly the same as when I was, [disbelieving], eight years old and you helped me escape from that terrible orphanage.

Character 2 [en]: [melodious] Well, um, fairy godmothers don't age the way, [gentle], humans do, though I mean, watching you grow old has been, you know, both heartbreaking and beautiful.

Character 1 [en]: I spent decades thinking you were just, [wistful], a childhood fantasy my broken mind created to, [tearful], cope with all that loneliness and pain.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] I never left. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [confused] But, um, why didn't you ever, [breaking], show yourself again, I mean, through all those years of struggling, you know, raising my children alone after Harold died?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Well, um, the rules of our magic are, [careful], strict about interference, and, you know, you needed to find your own strength, I mean, without relying on wishes.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, I'm dying. [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [pained] That's why I'm here now, because the, [heavy], rules change when a life approaches its, [whispered], natural end. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: So after seventy years of, [bitter], silence, you appear at my deathbed with, [sarcastic], what exactly—some magical cure that comes with, [exhausted], another set of your precious rules?

Character 2 [en]: No cure, dear one, but a, [tender], final wish before I must pass my duties to another lost child.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Well, um, I spent so many nights, [nostalgic], dreaming of what I'd wish for if you ever, [yearning], came back, but now, I mean, sitting here with these old bones, [tired], everything I wanted seems so pointless.

Character 2 [en]: Um, wishes at life's end are rarely about, [knowing], gaining something new, but rather about, [wise], leaving something behind, or perhaps, you know, finding peace with what, [meaningful], was.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] I want to see my daughter one more, [pleading], time—she hasn't spoken to me in fifteen, [broken], years since that terrible fight about her, [anguished], father's inheritance.

Character 2 [en]: Some wishes require no magic at all, just, [warm], courage and humility. [smiles sadly]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] She won't come.

Character 2 [en]: [mysterious] Well, um, she's already on her way here, because, [gentle], sometimes fairy godmothers plant seeds of, [hopeful], forgiveness in dreams, and, you know, she woke up this morning remembering how you used to sing her to sleep. [chuckles softly]

Character 1 [en]: [crying] Um, is that allowed, I mean, within your, [grateful], precious rules?

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, dreams aren't wishes, they're just, [playful], gentle suggestions that hearts can choose to, [tender], follow or ignore, and, you know, your daughter's heart was already searching for a way home.

Character 1 [en]: [peaceful] Then I suppose my real wish is to, [serene], remember how to sing that lullaby when she arrives.

Character 2 [en]: [melodious] Now that, my dear, [magical], brave girl who became a remarkable woman, [loving], is a wish I can grant with, [joyful], all the magic I have left, and, um, you'll find the words have never really, you know, left your heart.
