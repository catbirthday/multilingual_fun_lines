=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [casual] Well, um, I guess we should talk about, [amused], the elephant in the room since, I mean, everyone at this conference knows I've been, [direct], brokering deals that affect your territory but, er, nobody's had the guts to, [satisfied], actually say it to your face.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] So, um, you're the one who's been, [bitter], sneaking around behind my back for three months, well, convincing my biggest clients to jump ship.

Character 1 [en]: [shrugging] Um, look, I mean, it's not personal, it's just, [blunt], business and your numbers have been tanking anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] You know, um, my numbers are down because someone, [accusatory], has been spreading rumors about our supply chain issues that, well, don't even, [frustrated], exist.

Character 1 [en]: [dismissive] Well, I mean, if your operation was actually, [pointed], strong enough, a few rumors wouldn't, um, matter, but here we are with half your accounts ready to, [triumphant], sign with my clients tomorrow morning.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Um, listen, I know you think you've, [shaking], won this whole thing but, er, I've been in this territory for fifteen years and these relationships, [firm], aren't as fragile as you, well, seem to believe. [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [tactless] They're already gone.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, the funny thing is, [knowing], I've been recording every conversation you've had in, [calculated], this hotel bar tonight, including that lovely chat about, er, bribing the Henderson account with those, [smug], off-the-books incentives.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] That's completely, [panicking], illegal to record without consent and you know the courts won't, [defensive], even look at that evidence. [nervous laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [calm] Um, actually, this is a one-party consent state and, well, I was part of that, [measured], conversation when you didn't realize I was sitting behind you.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Look, maybe we can, [bargaining], work something out here because destroying each other won't, [pleading], help either of us in the long run. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [harsh] You know, um, the ironic thing is I was actually going to, [sardonic], offer you a partnership before I found out, well, what you've been doing behind, [disgusted], my back. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Well, um, shit.

Character 2 [en]: The corporate office already knows everything because I've been, [vindicated], documenting your interference for weeks, and tomorrow morning they're announcing, [satisfied], a full investigation into your company's practices.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Um, I guess I should have, well, just approached you directly instead of, [ashamed], playing these stupid games, but my boss insisted on the hostile approach.

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Your boss is my, [revelation], ex-husband who's still trying to destroy everything I've built.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Wait, you're the Rachel he's always, [realizing], talking about, the one who took half his clients in the divorce and built them into an, [impressed], empire twice the size of his. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [weary] Yeah, well, um, now you know why he sent you after my territory specifically, I mean, using you as just another, [bitter], pawn in his endless revenge fantasy.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Well, um, that manipulative bastard told me this was about, [betrayed], expanding into underserved markets, not some personal vendetta.

Character 2 [en]: Welcome to the real game where you've been, [sympathetic], played just as hard as you were trying to, [knowing], play me, though I have to admit your tactics were, [grudging], impressively ruthless for someone so green.
