=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [careful] So this is, um, a 1962 Kirby, [reverent], Classic Omega—I mean, these are incredibly rare, well, especially in this condition with the, [impressed], original cloth bag and chrome polish intact.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] It was Mom's.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] The motor housing shows it's been, [observant], maintained with real care over the decades, though I can see where someone, [technical], probably your mother, replaced the belt themselves using, [noting], a non-standard part that actually works better than the original.

Character 2 [en]: [wistful] Well, she always said, um, that taking care of things meant they'd, [emotional], outlast you—I mean, I guess she was right.

Character 1 [en]: [sympathetic] I'm sorry for your loss, um, and I can see why you'd want this, [understanding], restored—these machines, well, they hold more than just dust and, [thoughtful], memories sometimes. [sighs softly]

Character 2 [en]: [struggling] The thing is, I never thought I'd be the one, [breaking], inheriting anything from her since my siblings always seemed more deserving.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] But here you are with her most, [careful], practical possession, asking me to make it, [meaningful], work again instead of just buying something new.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I'm forty-eight, [laughs sadly]

Character 1 [en]: [attentive] That's not too late to start understanding what she, [realizing], saw in you, especially if she left you the house this, [knowing], vacuum cleaned for sixty years.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] How did you know about the, [vulnerable], house?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Because people don't usually bring, um, vintage vacuums for expensive repairs unless they're, [perceptive], planning to actually use them, well, and your hands have fresh paint under the nails.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] So, um, what? [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [honest] So I think your mother knew exactly what she was, [deliberate], doing when she chose you to take care of what she, [tender], loved most.

Character 2 [en]: [overwhelmed] God, I don't even, [shaky], know how to be a homeowner.

Character 1 [en]: The same way you learn anything that, [encouraging], matters—one small repair at a time.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Starting with this vacuum, I suppose, though I should mention the house has, [hesitant], original hardwood floors I just discovered under ancient, [amazed], carpet.

Character 1 [en]: Well, this Kirby has the original, um, hardwood attachment in pristine condition, [delighted], which means your mother probably knew about those floors all along and, well, was just waiting for someone to, [meaningful], uncover them.

Character 2 [en]: Someone who took, um, forty-eight years to realize they were capable of, [raw], maintaining something beautiful—yeah, well, that sounds like her sense of, [bittersweet], timing. [laughs wetly]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] I can have this ready by Thursday, um, and I'll include instructions for maintaining it that your mother, [thoughtful], would have approved of, along with my card in case you need help with, well, any other things that might, [gentle], break while you're learning.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Well, um, thank you. [sniffles]
