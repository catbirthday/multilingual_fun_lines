Scenario: A bounty hunter arrives at a bookbinder's workshop to collect on a decades-old bounty, only to discover the bookbinder is their former partner who betrayed them years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The bounty says Marcus Blackwood but the name on your shop says, [stunned], something else entirely now, doesn't it.

Character 2 [en]: [frozen] After fifteen years you walk through, [shaking], my door holding that piece of paper like nothing happened. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Um, well, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You tracked me here to this, [desperate], quiet workshop where I bind books and pretend the past, [hollow], doesn't exist, where I've made something, [breaking], peaceful from all that blood.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I didn't know it was, um, you until I walked in and saw your, [recognizing], hands working the leather the same way you used to, [remembering], clean your rifle, and suddenly I couldn't, [choked up], breathe.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] The bounty must be worth a fortune by now, [calculating], enough to retire on, enough to finally, [tired], stop hunting.

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] Twenty years of compound interest makes it worth more than, [swallowing hard], either of us ever dreamed about back when we were partners, [distant], back when we trusted each other with, [pained], everything.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] I left you that note, um, explaining why I had to disappear, why the job went wrong, and, well, [anguished], why staying would have gotten us both killed.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] A note doesn't heal a shoulder full of shrapnel or explain, [betrayed], why you took our entire score and left me, [voice cracking], bleeding in that warehouse.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] They had my sister, they had her for three days before that job and, [trembling], I couldn't tell you because they said they'd kill her if I, [broken], breathed a word to anyone, especially, [whispered], you.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Your sister was, um, I mean, we went to her funeral together, [confused], two years before that job, I held you while you, [remembering], cried at her gravestone, so how could she, [bewildered], even be alive. [voice trails off]

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] That funeral was staged to protect her from our enemies who would have, [heavy], used her against us, against, [meaningful], me.

Character 1 [en]: [hurt] So our entire partnership was built on, well, um, lies and I was just the convenient, [bitter], muscle who didn't need to know the truth, [disgusted], who didn't deserve to know anything real about, uh, you.

Character 2 [en]: You knew the real me in every way that, [earnest], mattered, except for this one impossible secret that would have, [regretful], destroyed everything.

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] I've carried this bounty for two decades, [struggling], waiting for any trace of Marcus Blackwood to surface.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] So what happens now that you've found him, [steady], or what's left of him in this bookbinder who just wants to, [pleading], forget. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: The man who put out this bounty died, [revealing], three winters ago in prison.

Character 2 [en]: Then why did you, um, even bother coming here if there's, [confused], no one left to pay you, I mean, what's the point now. [bewildered]

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] Maybe I just needed to see your face when I, um, told you that I never stopped, [emotional], looking, not for the money but because, well, leaving things unfinished is like carrying glass in your chest.

Character 2 [en]: [thawed] Would you like some tea while we, um, figure out how to properly, [gentle], bury Marcus Blackwood and let him rest, well, forever. [hopeful pause]
