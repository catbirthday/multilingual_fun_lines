Scenario: A radiologist discovers she has terminal cancer while reviewing her own scans late at night, when the only other person in the hospital wing is the vending machine servicer who was her first love twenty years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: I wasn't expecting to, um, [frozen], see anyone else in the radiology wing at, bueno, [hollow], a las 2 de la madrugada, y menos a alguien, sabes, reponiendo barritas de chocolate.

Character 2 [mix]: [startled] Um, ¿Sarah?

Character 1 [mix]: [shaking] God, Jake, of all the nights to, [breaking], encontrarte después de 20 años, tenía que ser, [whispered], esta noche cuando acabo de descubrir algo, [quieter], terrible en mis propios escáneres.

Character 2 [mix]: [stunned] Wait, ¿qué?

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] The shadows on my liver are, [cracking], exactamente lo que llevo años explicándole a los pacientes, el tipo que, [defeated], significa que todo cambia, el tipo que te hace entender de repente lo que 3 a 6 meses, [barely audible], realmente significa. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [mix]: [gentle] You need to sit down before you, [concerned], te caigas porque estás temblando como una hoja ahora mismo.

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter laugh] I've been looking at death on screens for, este, 15 años, comunicándole a la gente sus, [clinical], peores miedos con compasión practicada, pero ver tu propia, bueno, [breaking], mortalidad iluminada en escala de grises es, ya sabes, completamente diferente.

Character 2 [mix]: [soft] Listen, um, I know we haven't talked since, bueno, [careful], aquella noche que te fuiste a estudiar medicina, pero estoy, [steady], aquí ahora y no deberías estar sola con esto, eh, no esta noche al menos. [long pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [vulnerable] The irony is that I spent decades learning to, [weak], leer estas imágenes perfectamente.

Character 2 [mix]: [quiet] Sometimes the things we know best are the, [pained], más difíciles de afrontar cuando se vuelven personales, las cosas que creíamos, [trailing off], entender hasta que son nuestras.

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] I keep staring at the screen hoping I'll see something, [frantic], diferente, algún artefacto o sombra que signifique que estoy equivocada, pero la evidencia es, [defeated], clarísima, de libro.

Character 2 [mix]: You taught me once that courage isn't about, [remembering], no tener miedo, se trata de seguir adelante incluso cuando, [emotional], el terror te tiene paralizada. [sighs]

Character 1 [mix]: That was about you enlisting, este, no sobre, [struggling], yo enfrentándome al cáncer sola a los 42 sin, bueno, [bitter], sin familia a la que siquiera llamar. [choked laugh]

Character 2 [mix]: You're not alone if you don't, [firm], quieres estarlo.

Character 1 [mix]: Jake, you can't just, este, [overwhelmed], aparecer así en mi vida porque casualmente estabas, bueno, [crying softly], arreglando máquinas expendedoras durante mi apocalipsis personal, o sea, [shaking], así no funciona esto.

Character 2 [mix]: [steady] Yes, exactamente.

Character 1 [mix]: [confused] I spent 20 years building walls so I wouldn't, [struggling], necesitar a nadie, convirtiéndome en la doctora perfecta que podía diagnosticar, [breaking], todo excepto su propia necesidad de, [whispered], conexión humana. [crying quietly]

Character 2 [mix]: Those walls won't, este, [tender], ayudarte ahora, y quizá no es, bueno, [hopeful], casualidad que esté aquí esta noche.

Character 1 [mix]: [exhausted] I'm too tired and too, este, [scared], aterrada para discutir sobre el destino o el momento, así que, bueno, [surrendering], ¿te quedarás conmigo mientras proceso esto? [voice breaking]

Character 2 [mix]: [warm] I'll sit with you as long as, este, [determined], necesites, esta noche y lo que venga después, porque, bueno, [emotional], algunas conexiones nunca se rompen de verdad, simplemente, ya sabes, [soft smile], esperan el momento adecuado para volver a importar.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: I wasn't expecting to, um, [frozen], see anyone else in the radiology wing at, well, [hollow], two in the morning, especially not someone, you know, restocking candy bars.

Character 2: [startled] Um, Sarah?

Character 1: [shaking] God, Jake, of all the nights to, [breaking], run into you after twenty years, it had to be, [whispered], tonight when I just found something, [quieter], terrible on my own scans.

Character 2: [stunned] Wait, what?

Character 1: [trembling] The shadows on my liver are, [cracking], exactly what I've been telling patients about for years, the kind that, [defeated], mean everything changes, the kind that make you suddenly understand what three to six months, [barely audible], really means. [exhales slowly]

Character 2: [gentle] You need to sit down before you, [concerned], fall over because you're shaking like a leaf right now.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] I've been looking at death on screens for, um, fifteen years, telling people their, [clinical], worst fears with practiced compassion, but seeing your own, well, [breaking], mortality lit up in grayscale is, you know, completely different.

Character 2: [soft] Listen, um, I know we haven't talked since, well, [careful], that night you left for medical school, but I'm, [steady], here now and you shouldn't be alone with this, er, not tonight anyway. [long pause]

Character 1: [vulnerable] The irony is that I spent decades learning to, [weak], read these images perfectly.

Character 2: [quiet] Sometimes the things we know best are the, [pained], hardest to face when they become personal, the things we thought we, [trailing off], understood until they're ours.

Character 1: [desperate] I keep staring at the screen hoping I'll see something, [frantic], different, some artifact or shadow that means I'm wrong, but the evidence is, [defeated], textbook clear.

Character 2: You taught me once that courage isn't about, [remembering], not being afraid, it's about moving forward even when, [emotional], terror has you frozen. [sighs]

Character 1: That was about you enlisting, um, not about, [struggling], me facing cancer alone at forty-two with, well, [bitter], no family left to even call. [choked laugh]

Character 2: You're not alone if you don't, [firm], want to be.

Character 1: Jake, you can't just, um, [overwhelmed], waltz back into my life because you happened to be, well, [crying softly], servicing vending machines during my personal apocalypse, I mean, [shaking], that's not how this works.

Character 2: [steady] Yes, exactly.

Character 1: [confused] I spent twenty years building walls so I wouldn't, [struggling], need anyone, becoming the perfect doctor who could diagnose, [breaking], everything except her own need for, [whispered], human connection. [crying quietly]

Character 2: Those walls won't, um, [tender], help you now, and maybe it's, well, [hopeful], not an accident that I'm here tonight.

Character 1: [exhausted] I'm too tired and too, um, [scared], terrified to argue about fate or timing, so, well, [surrendering], will you just sit with me while I process this? [voice breaking]

Character 2: [warm] I'll sit with you as long as, um, [determined], you need, through tonight and whatever comes next, because, well, [emotional], some connections never really break, they just, you know, [soft smile], wait for the right moment to matter again.
