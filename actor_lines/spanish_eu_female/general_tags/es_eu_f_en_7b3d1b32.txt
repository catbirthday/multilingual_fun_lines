=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] You know, um, she's showing you pictures of her late husband and you're still, [disgusted], planning to take everything she has left of him.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, I mean, it's not like I'm, [clearing throat], forcing her to sign anything because she's, [nervous laugh], choosing to trust me with her investment portfolio, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Um, choosing to trust the fake credentials you spent, [incredulous], three weeks perfecting while her husband was dying in, [breaking], hospice care, I mean, that's what you call a choice?

Character 2 [en]: [irritated] Look, uhh, everyone makes their own decisions and I'm just, [dismissive], offering opportunities that she's, [shrugging], free to accept or decline like, well, any other business transaction.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You've been doing this for, um, fifteen years and somehow you still, [hollow], convince yourself that stealing from grieving widows is just, [sarcastic], business as usual while your own mother, well, died alone wondering why you never visited. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] That's, umm, completely different because my mother never, [trailing off], understood what I was trying to build out here.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] She's, um, eighty-three years old and just asked if you remind her of, [pained], her grandson who stopped calling after college, you know?

Character 2 [en]: The resemblance is just, [uncomfortable], coincidence and has nothing to do with why she's, [quickening], so eager to trust me with her, [swallowing hard], financial future.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Well, um, there's still time to walk away from this one, I mean, to leave her with, [pleading], something to live on instead of another empty account and, uhh, shattered faith in humanity.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Walking away now would mean, um, three months of groundwork wasted, and I've got, [calculating], bills to pay and a lifestyle that doesn't, [harsh], maintain itself on good intentions, you know? [short laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [weary] So, umm, you'll take her last forty thousand dollars even though you heard her say it's, [anguished], all she has left for her granddaughter's cancer treatment?

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Medical sob stories are, [detached], always part of the game because everyone has some, [cynical], tragedy they're dealing with.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Remember when you actually wanted to be, [wistful], a real financial advisor before the first con turned into, [defeated], ten years of this? [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [sharp] Stop it.

Character 1 [en]: You're about to, um, destroy another human being who's showing you, [heartbroken], photos of her dead husband while making you, uhh, chamomile tea because you mentioned having trouble sleeping.

Character 2 [en]: The tea tastes like, well, disappointment anyway and I'm, [wavering], already too deep into this character to break now, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Um, she just said you have kind eyes like her son used to, and I mean, you're still going to, [devastated], do this to her anyway.

Character 2 [en]: Kind eyes are just, [strained], genetics and muscle movements that help close, [mechanical], deals faster than aggressive tactics ever, well, could, umm, accomplish.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, when she realizes what you've done and stops, [broken], eating for three weeks like the last one did, that'll be on us again. [silence]

Character 2 [en]: There is no, [frantic], us here because you're just, umm, the voice I'll silence with enough whiskey to forget her, [cracking], grateful smile when she signs those papers thinking, well, she's securing her granddaughter's future.
