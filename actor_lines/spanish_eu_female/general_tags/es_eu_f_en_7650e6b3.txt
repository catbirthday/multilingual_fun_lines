=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [careful] Um, I recognize you from the news, er, Detective Morrison—you're the one who, [tense], put my brother away for a crime he didn't, [bitter], commit seven years ago, well, aren't you?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Look, um, I don't have time for this right now, I mean, my daughter's been, [frantic], missing for three hours and her car's somewhere in this garage. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: Well, uh, I've been watching these cameras for, [measured], twelve hours a day for three years now, and um, I saw a teenage girl leave through, [quiet], the east stairwell about an hour ago.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] You saw her? I mean, um, wait—you're Tommy's brother, aren't you, the one who, [recognition dawning], wrote all those letters to the department saying I, [guilt creeping in], planted evidence when I know I didn't, er, at least I thought I didn't.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] Yeah, well, I'm Marcus, and um, despite what you did to my family, I mean, I'm going to, [reluctant], help you find your daughter. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: Why would you, um, I mean, after everything that happened, er, why would you even, [confused], consider helping me when your brother is still, [voice dropping], sitting in a cell because of my testimony?

Character 1 [en]: Because I know what it's, [pained], like to lose someone you love to circumstances beyond your, [weary], control, and no parent deserves that kind of hell. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [broken] The case against your brother seemed so, [uncertain], airtight at the time, but lately I've been having these, [troubled], dreams where the evidence doesn't add up. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Well, um, dreams or not, your daughter went out that exit with, er, a boy about nineteen, wearing a leather jacket, and uh, they seemed to be arguing about something.

Character 2 [en]: [alarmed] That sounds like her ex-boyfriend Jake who I, [angry], specifically told her to stay away from because he's been, [darkening], dealing drugs out of his apartment and getting increasingly, [fearful], violent with her.

Character 1 [en]: [urgent] Then we need to move fast because the footage showed him, [concerned], grabbing her arm pretty aggressively.

Character 2 [en]: God, this is exactly what I was, [panicking], afraid of happening when she started sneaking out to see him again despite the, [desperate], restraining order we filed last month after he, [shaking], broke her wrist.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Listen, um, I know where that kid hangs out because, well, he's tried to deal in this garage before and I've had to, [grim], chase him off multiple times, so, er, I can take you there right now if you want.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] I don't deserve your help, um, not after what I cost your family, but I'm, [humble], begging you to help me save my daughter.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, um, maybe after we find her safe, you know, we can talk about reopening my brother's, [hopeful], case with fresh eyes.

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] If you help me get Sarah back safely, I'll, [committed], personally review every piece of evidence in your brother's case and testify to any, [sincere], inconsistencies I find in my original investigation.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Come on then, um, we're wasting time here and, er, every minute counts when someone's, [worried], in danger like this. [moves quickly]

Character 2 [en]: [following] Thank you, Marcus, I mean, um, I know this can't be easy for you, [emotional], helping the man who destroyed your family.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Well, um, let's just focus.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] You're right, um, we can deal with the past later, but right now my, [focused], daughter needs us both to put aside everything else and, [urgent], work together to bring her home safely, er, before it's too late.
