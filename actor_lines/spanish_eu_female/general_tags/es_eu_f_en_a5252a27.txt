Scenario: A venue manager confronts the enforcer they've been paying protection money to for years after discovering the threats were fabricated and the enforcer was actually protecting them from nothing.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Twenty thousand a month for five years makes, [calculating], one point two million dollars I've paid you for, [bitter], protection from threats that never actually, [voice rising], existed.

Character 2 [en]: [calm] You're finally catching up to the, [amused], reality of our arrangement after all this time.

Character 1 [en]: The rival gangs you warned me about, [shaking], the supposed arson attempts, the protection from corrupt cops—all of it was, [incredulous], complete fabrication.

Character 2 [en]: Fabrication is such a harsh word when, [chilling], what I provided was peace of mind.

Character 1 [en]: Peace of mind built on, [furious], lies while my family struggled because I was hemorrhaging money to, [disgusted], a con artist playing dress-up as, [spitting], a protector.

Character 2 [en]: [blunt] Well, I mean, you slept soundly every night believing your venue was, [matter-of-fact], safe, didn't you?

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] My daughter couldn't go to college because I was, [choking], saving every penny to pay your protection fees thinking that, [breaking], without you we'd lose everything.

Character 2 [en]: [ice-cold] Um, the thing is, fear is a, [deliberate], commodity just like anything else, and well, you were, [shrugging], willing to pay premium prices for, [satisfied], it.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Do you, um, even understand what you've done—I mean, the lives you've, [hollow], destroyed with this scheme?

Character 2 [en]: [unmoved] Lives get destroyed every day in this, [philosophical], city, at least yours was destroyed, [casual], profitably.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] The police have recordings now, transcripts of you, [steady], admitting everything to your, [determined], associate last week.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Well, that's, um, an interesting bluff but we both know you're not the type to, [condescending], involve authorities.

Character 1 [en]: I wasn't, um, that type until I found out my mother died thinking, I mean, we were in danger, spending her last months terrified because of, [venomous], your stories.

Character 2 [en]: [dangerous] You know, um, sometimes fake threats have a way of, [menacing], becoming real ones when people get too, well, [warning], ambitious with their, [slow], accusations.

Character 1 [en]: That's exactly the kind of thing, well, the detective said you'd say, um, which is why they're, [revealing], recording this conversation right, [triumphant], now.

Character 2 [en]: You're making a, [angry], mistake that you can't take back and, um, I mean, even if what you're saying is true, [threatening], prison won't erase what I, [dark], know about your operation.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Well, the difference is, um, everything you know is legal, and, I mean, everything I know about, [resolute], you sends you away for, [final], twenty years.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] This isn't over just because you've grown, [seething], a spine after five years of, [contemptuous], cowardice.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Actually it is, um, over—the detectives are, [relieved], waiting outside and they said to tell you that, well, [peaceful], your partner Marcus already gave you up for, [satisfied], immunity. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Marcus wouldn't—I mean, we had an understanding, a, [disbelieving], code that went back fifteen years, and um, he wouldn't just, [hollow], throw that away for, [broken], immunity.
