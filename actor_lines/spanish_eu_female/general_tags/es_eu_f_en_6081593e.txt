=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [wearily] They called me at midnight saying you were here, and honestly, I wasn't even surprised—just exhausted thinking about doing this dance again.

Character 2 [en]: [sheepishly] Look, I know what you're thinking, but this time it's different, I swear—I've been clean for six months and this was just wrong place, wrong time.

Character 1 [en]: You realize I'm still paying off the lawyer from the last time you swore it was different, right? Twenty thousand dollars because I believed your story about the investment opportunity. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] That wasn't entirely my fault—Marcus was the one who pulled me into that scheme, and you know how persuasive he can be when he wants something.

Character 1 [en]: [flatly] Always someone else.

Character 2 [en]: No, listen, I'm trying to explain that I've learned from all that, okay? I've been working construction, staying with Mom, keeping my head down—this arrest is genuinely a misunderstanding.

Character 1 [en]: The officer said you were caught with stolen merchandise in your car, so help me understand how that's a misunderstanding when the security footage shows you walking out with it.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] My buddy Jake asked me to hold onto some stuff while he moved apartments—I didn't know it was stolen, I thought he bought it from that going-out-of-business sale.

Character 1 [en]: Jake. The same Jake who got you arrested three years ago for that check fraud thing where somehow I ended up being investigated too? [exhales] That Jake?

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Yeah, but he's changed too, we both have—people deserve second chances, or in my case, third or fourth chances, I guess.

Character 1 [en]: Do you have any idea what it's like being known as the person who always bails you out? My coworkers literally have a betting pool on when you'll call next.

Character 2 [en]: [wounded] That's not fair—I went two whole years without asking you for anything, and I only called tonight because Mom's too sick to handle this stress.

Character 1 [en]: Mom's sick? [concerned] Since when is Mom sick? Why didn't anyone tell me she was sick?

Character 2 [en]: She didn't want you to worry, said you had enough on your plate with the divorce and everything—it's her heart, they're doing tests after New Year's.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] God, of course she didn't tell me, probably thought I'd blame you for the stress even though, [sighs], honestly I probably would have.

Character 2 [en]: [earnestly] I'll pay you back.

Character 1 [en]: You always say that, and then something happens—your car breaks down, you lose your job, someone else screws you over—and I end up eating the cost while you disappear again.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] This time I have a real job with benefits and everything, and I can set up automatic payments from my check—fifty dollars a week until it's all paid back.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Fine, I'll post bail, but this is it—after this, you're on your own because I can't keep being your safety net. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [gratefully] I know I've burned through all my chances with you, but thank you—and Merry Christmas, I guess, even though this is the worst possible Christmas Eve reunion.
