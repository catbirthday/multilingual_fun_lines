=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [horrified] Margaret, no.

Character 2 [en]: It's nothing, um, just a little tumble down the stairs, I mean, [dismissive], I've had worse falls chasing after you when you were, well, seven and determined to climb every tree.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Your arm is bent at an angle that, [sickened], makes my stomach turn and there's blood seeping through your, [breaking], housedress. [gasps]

Character 2 [en]: [stubborn] I've been taking care of this family for forty years without, [proud], making a fuss about every little scrape. [coughs wetly]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Well, um, this isn't a scrape, Margaret, I mean, you're, [anguished], seventy-eight years old and you need proper medical attention.

Character 2 [en]: [weakening] The children need their afternoon snack at three and little Emma, [labored], won't sleep without her purple blanket.

Character 1 [en]: Forget about the children's snacks because right now, [fierce], you're the one who needs taking care of, and I'm, [cracking], calling an ambulance whether you, [determined], like it or not.

Character 2 [en]: Your mother would have, [nostalgic], known how to handle this without all the drama, just like she, [fading], handled everything with grace.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Um, Mom's been gone for, well, fifteen years, Margaret, and you're the one who, [grateful], held this family together after she died, who, [voice breaking], taught me that wine could tell stories just like, [tender], the bedtime tales you used to read.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Well, um, I thought I heard her calling from the kitchen, I mean, [disoriented], just before I fell.

Character 1 [en]: [crying] Um, that's because, well, you're going into shock and I mean, [terrified], your skin is turning the color of, [medical], ash which means your blood pressure is dropping and we're, [urgent], running out of time. [sobs]

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Sweet boy, you always did, [motherly], worry too much about everyone else, even when you should have been, [wistful], out living your own life. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: You gave me a life by, [overwhelmed], raising me when Mom couldn't and Dad wouldn't, and now it's, [determined], my turn to save yours. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I suppose if you insist, but, I mean, [relenting], promise me you'll remember to decant that Bordeaux properly and, [fading], not rush it like you always do. [laughs weakly]

Character 1 [en]: I promise, um, but only if you, well, [bargaining], promise to stop being so damn stubborn and, [pleading], let me help you the way you've helped me. [voice cracking]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Um, I can hear the sirens now, well, [peaceful], they sound like the dinner bells from when your mother used to call us all home.

Character 1 [en]: Just keep your eyes open and focused on me, [desperate], not on whatever shadows you're seeing. [shaking]

Character 2 [en]: [drifting] You turned out just like I, [proud], hoped you would, my dear boy, even with all that, [amused], fancy wine knowledge. [trails off]

Character 1 [en]: [breaking] Well, um, you taught me that the best pairings, I mean, [tearful], aren't just about wine and food but about the people who, [grateful], share them together.

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] Um, tell the children I'll be back soon, well, [hopeful], someone needs to make sure they eat their vegetables properly and, I mean, [determined], your wife never cuts them small enough.
