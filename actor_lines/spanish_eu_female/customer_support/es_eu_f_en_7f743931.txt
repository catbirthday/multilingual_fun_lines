Customer [en]: Oh thank god. Um. Sorry. I'm just—the menu kept, uh, looping back.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no no no, um, don't apologize at all, I totally—wait, let me just—I mean those phone trees are, uh, absolutely terrible and I'm so sorry you had to deal with that for, um, for so long, let me just pull up your account here real quick if you have your account number or, uh, or phone number?

Customer [en]: Right. Yes. It's, um... wait, account or phone?

Customer Support [en]: Either one works! So, um, whichever you have handy, I can—no wait, actually phone number might be, uh, might be quicker if that's okay?

Customer [en]: Five five five. Um. Two nine—no, sorry. Two eight one four.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect, so that's 555-2814 and, um, okay so I'm seeing here—oh wait, is this, uh, is this regarding the order that was placed on, hmm, let me see, Tuesday the 15th, order number ORD-4429-BC, or, um, or is this something else entirely because I can definitely help with whatever you need?

Customer [en]: Tuesday? I thought—wait. Which Tuesday?

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, um, sorry sorry, I should've been—it's last Tuesday, so, uh, that would be November 15th, and the order total was, hmm, $47.92, does that, um, does that sound right to you?

Customer [en]: Um, maybe? I'm sorry. I don't... forty-seven?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, let me just—actually wait, you know what, let me start over because I'm, uh, I'm getting ahead of myself here, what can I, um, what can I help you with today specifically?

Customer [en]: The delivery. It says—no. Um. The tracking says delivered but...

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Oh okay so—and this is, um, this is actually really common—so the tracking for ORD-4429-BC shows delivered but, uh, but you haven't received it yet, is that, um, is that what's happening? Because I can definitely—wait, let me just—I can definitely look into this for you right away.

Customer [en]: Yes. Sorry. Should've just, uh, said that first.

Customer Support [en]: No no no, you're totally fine! So, um, so what I'm gonna do is—actually first, let me just, uh, verify the delivery address we have on file, so that's showing as, hmm, 1847 Oak Street, apartment, uh, apartment 3B, is that—wait no sorry, that's 3D, apartment 3D, is that correct?

Customer [en]: Three D? No. Um. It's B. Like... boy?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Oh my gosh, okay so—I'm so sorry—so that's, uh, that's definitely the problem right there, we have 3D in the system but you're, um, you're actually in 3B, let me just—hold on, I'm updating this right now in your profile ACC-2847-MN and, um, and I'm gonna contact the carrier immediately about this.

Customer [en]: So it went to, uh, the wrong apartment? That's—wait, D?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so, um, yeah it looks like it went to 3D instead of 3B, which is—I mean that's completely our fault—wait no, actually let me check, hmm, let me see who entered this... okay so regardless, um, what I can do right now is either send a replacement with overnight shipping at no charge with tracking REF-8829-QT, or, uh, or I can try to retrieve it from 3D if you know your neighbors?

Customer [en]: Um, I don't really... overnight's fine. Sorry. This is, uh, embarrassing.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh no, please don't be embarrassed! This is, um, this is literally why I'm here and honestly? Between you and me, after dealing with that awful phone tree for ten minutes you're being, uh, incredibly patient, so I'm gonna make sure this gets sorted out perfectly, your new order ORT-4429-BC-R will arrive tomorrow before noon, is there, um, anything else I can help with today?
