=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm—sorry, I know this is probably, uh, stupid but I got this complaint?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—hmm, okay so basically I need your driver ID, like, the one that starts with DRV?

Customer [en]: It's, um, DRV-4429-BK. Sorry. I'm just. Really upset.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, so, uh, I'm seeing account DRV-4429-BK here and, um, looks like there's a complaint filed yesterday, reference number CMP-88291-QX, so basically what, uh, what happened exactly?

Customer [en]: This passenger said I was—wait no, they said—sorry. Said I was rude?

Customer Support [en]: Mm-hmm, so the complaint CMP-88291-QX says, um, "unprofessional behavior" and, uh, I mean, these things happen but like, tell me your side?

Customer [en]: I maybe asked them to, uh, not eat in my car? That's—that's it.

Customer Support [en]: So, uh, lemme just, hmm, check the trip details here, trip ID TRP-55847-NZ shows it was, um, like a twenty-minute ride and, uh, no other flags so...

Customer [en]: Twenty minutes of them, um, eating messy food! Sorry. I shouldn't—I'm being dramatic.

Customer Support [en]: No no, so basically, um, look, I've seen like hundreds of these and, uh, food complaints are super common, so let me just, um, add your statement to case CMP-88291-QX here.

Customer [en]: But my rating dropped. I need—I can't afford to lose this job. Please.

Customer Support [en]: Right so, uh, here's what I can do, and like, I'm gonna be straight with you—ratings from complaint CMP-88291-QX, those are, um, basically locked for 24 hours but, uh, after review they sometimes get reversed.

Customer [en]: Sometimes? That's—I mean, probably not gonna help me then.

Customer Support [en]: So actually, um, with your driver history—and I'm seeing like, really solid stats here in account DRV-4429-BK—so basically you've got, uh, a strong case for appeal.

Customer [en]: Sorry, I just—um, I'm overreacting. My kid's, uh, medical bills and I just...

Customer Support [en]: Listen, so, um, between you and me? File appeal APL-77562-RT, and uh, specifically mention the, um, the food policy violation by passenger, that basically fast-tracks it.

Customer [en]: Really? That would—wait, APL what? Sorry.

Customer Support [en]: APL-77562-RT, so like, I'm gonna, uh, pre-fill some of it for you right now and, um, honestly? Should be resolved in, hmm, maybe six hours tops?

Customer [en]: I'm sorry for, um, being so—you know. Desperate. Embarrassed.

Customer Support [en]: Hey no, so like, totally get it, um, bills are bills, and uh, look—check your app tomorrow morning, case CMP-88291-QX should show resolved, and um, your rating should bounce back.
