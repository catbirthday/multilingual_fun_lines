Customer [en]: Um, it's... what's the word... recurring. Like, uh, subscription thing for the stable supplies?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, okay so, um, I'm seeing here your account ID is ACC-7793-HX and, uh, you have the premium subscription for equestrian supplies, and um, let me just check what happened with this month's...

Customer [en]: Premium. Right. Paying triple. Getting nothing.

Customer Support [en]: I completely understand your frustration, and, um, looking at your order history here, ORD-5521-QM shows delivered but, uh, you're saying it's incorrect, so let me just...

Customer [en]: Wrong brand. Wrong quantity. Wrong everything.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm really, uh, really sorry about this, especially seeing you're, hmm, one of our platinum members since, uh, 2018, and this shouldn't be happening at all...

Customer [en]: Wait, you're... um, actually fixing this? Like, uh, properly handling it?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, absolutely, and, um, because of the repeated issues, I'm also, uh, applying credit CRD-8834-NP for three months of your subscription fee, which should, hmm, reflect immediately on your account...

Customer [en]: That's... I mean, um, that's actually helpful. Thank you for, uh, taking this seriously.

Customer Support [en]: Of course, and, um, I'm also putting a note here with reference REF-1105-TT that, uh, all your future orders need manual quality check before shipping, so this doesn't...

Customer [en]: Um, that's exactly what... what's the word... proactive? Yes. Finally someone competent.

Customer Support [en]: Well, um, I appreciate that, and uh, just to confirm, you'll get tracking number TRK-6629-BD within, hmm, within the hour, and I'll personally monitor this until delivery...

Customer [en]: I genuinely, um, appreciate you sorting this. Really. Thank you for the specific help.

Customer Support [en]: It's my pleasure, and, um, again I'm so sorry about the, uh, the previous issues, but your express order should solve everything for tomorrow's competition, and please don't hesitate to...
