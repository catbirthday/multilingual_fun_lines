Customer [en]: No application. Um. Just calling first time.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, okay so—um, let me start fresh here then, and uh, basically what we'll need is—hmm, let me see—for new lease applications, code NLA-4429-B, you're looking at, um, monthly rates that depend on your credit profile and the, uh, total equipment value you need financed, so—

Customer [en]: How much for... uh... thirty thousand worth.

Customer [en]: Um... confused. Just... what's cheapest monthly. That's all.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, simplest option—um, the absolute lowest monthly would be, uh, our extended seventy-two month lease, code EXT-72-LS, which brings you down to, hmm, about seven twenty-five monthly, and um, I know it seems like a lot of options but we'll walk through everything step by step, it's going to be really straightforward once we get your application started—

Customer [en]: Seven twenty-five... uh... that's doable. What's next.

Customer [en]: Two hundred thousand. Er... give or take. Um. Is that enough?

Customer Support [en]: Oh that's—um, absolutely that's more than enough, we can work with—hmm, anything over seventy-five thousand annually, so uh, you're well above threshold THR-75K-ANN, and actually, um, with your numbers here I think we might even be able to get you slightly better than that seven twenty-five I quoted, so this is all looking really good—
