=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um. Hi. So I was, uh... wondering about. Er. Bundling? My services?

Customer Support [en]: Let me pull that up. Account number ends in—sorry, I mean, can you verify the last four of your account? Need to get into the right screen here.

Customer [en]: Oh, um, it's. Uh. 7-2-9-1.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. Pulling up your profile now... okay so you've got internet service at the 200 megabit tier, that's account INT-4492-BN31, and I see... just the one service currently.

Customer [en]: Yeah. Um. Just internet. But, er... bills are. You know. Getting tight.

Customer Support [en]: Mmm-hmm, checking bundle options... So we've got—wait, that's not—sorry, wrong tab. Here we go. Package deal BDL-8827-QX with internet, TV, and phone. Currently showing at... let me recalculate this...

Customer [en]: Um, how much would that, uh. Er. How much exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So your current internet is ninety-eight monthly, but if we bundle all three under promotion code PRO-55K-SAVE, it drops to—actually, hold on—eighty-five total. That's less than you're paying now.

Customer [en]: Wait. Really? Um. That's, uh... that's LESS? For MORE stuff?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah. System's showing the triple play discount at reference SKU-9981-TPD. Locks in for twenty-four months. No activation fees if we process today.

Customer [en]: Oh my god. Um. That's... er, that would really help. With, uh. Medical bills and...

Customer Support [en]: I hear you. Actually just helped my mom set up the same bundle last month—sorry, getting personal—but yeah, every bit helps these days. Want me to start that conversion?

Customer [en]: Wait, um, are there any, uh... catches? Er. Hidden fees?

Customer Support [en]: Checking the fine print on bundle ID BDL-8827-QX... taxes add about four-fifty, equipment's included, no install charge. Total comes to eighty-nine forty-three monthly.

Customer [en]: That's still. Um. Nine dollars less! Er, and I get TV? Really?

Customer Support [en]: Mm-hmm, one-sixty channels plus the sports—no wait, sorry—one-forty channels. Sports package is separate but you get basic cable, HBO, and streaming app access under login credentials USR-7291-STREAM.

Customer [en]: This is, um... I didn't expect this. Uh. At all. Yes! Please!

Customer Support [en]: Starting that now... just need the service address to match with order form ORD-3347-NEW. Still at the Maple Street location?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah. 4421 Maple. Er... thank you. So much. Really.

Customer Support [en]: All set. Confirmation number is CNF-888209-BDL, should get an email within five minutes. Install window is Thursday between noon and—sorry, between two and four PM. Saved you over a hundred annually.
