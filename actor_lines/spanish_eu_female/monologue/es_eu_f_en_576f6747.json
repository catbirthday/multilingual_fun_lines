[warm] \"How's that biology exam going, kiddo?\" [pause] Every single time. [crying while speaking] I mentioned once—just once—that I might have to drop out because of, uh, because of money, and he just nodded and said \"that's a shame.\" [regretful] I thought he didn't care. [gasp softly] But he was listening the whole time. [very melancholic] God, I didn't even know he was sick. [frustrated] Last month he seemed fine, joking about how I always left his seat, er, too far forward. [laugh] Such a small thing to complain about. [very sad] And now he's gone and he's... he's literally changing my entire life. [overwhelmed] Four years of tuition, room and board, even, hmm, even money for books. [cry] I can actually become a doctor now. [shaky voice] Mr. Harrison, I don't know if you can hear this somehow but... [very sincerely] thank you for believing in me when I couldn't even believe in myself."
