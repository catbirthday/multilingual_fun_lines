Speaker [en]: You know, I was just sitting here looking at that old photo—the one from your first day of kindergarten, and, um, it got me thinking about everything. [warm] I mean, here you are now, this whole person with your own life and dreams and... [pause] The thing is, honey, I don't think I tell you enough how, well, how proud I am. Really proud. [sniffle] Not just of what you've accomplished—though honestly, that too—but of who you are. The way you treat people, how you, er, handle things when they get tough. [slowly] You've become so much stronger than I ever was at your age. 

And I know I wasn't always—[clearing throat] I made mistakes, you know? Plenty of them. But somehow you took all of that and, like, turned it into wisdom. [chuckle] Remember when you were little and you'd say you wanted to be just like me? [shaky voice] Well, the truth is, kiddo, you've become so much better. You've got this, hmm, this kindness about you that just... anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is—[pause] [very sincerely] I look at you now and I see everything I hoped you'd become and more. You did good, sweetheart. You really did good.
