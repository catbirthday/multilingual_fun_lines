Speaker [en]: [very excited] Sixty percent! They're rolling it out to all twenty-three facilities—I just got off the call with corporate and I'm literally shaking. [laugh] You know how they said my idea was "interesting but impractical" last year? Well, um, guess who's impractical now? 

[pause] I keep thinking about all those nights in the lab, testing different enzyme combinations, everyone telling me I was wasting my time on—[passionate] but I knew! I knew if we could just break down the proteins at that specific temperature, we could salvage so much more. [quickly] Three million pounds of food waste, gone, just like that. 

Actually, wait—[stunned] did I really just say three million pounds? That's... that's actual impact. [warm] Like, that's families getting fed, that's less methane in landfills, that's—

[clearing throat] Sorry, I'm getting all emotional but honestly? [proud] When Jennifer from the Seattle plant called me crying because her team hit their best efficiency numbers ever using my process... [trailing off] I mean, you work on something for so long, and then suddenly it's real, it's everywhere, it's actually changing things.

[very sincerely] They want me to present at the global summit. Me. The person who got written up for "excessive experimentation" is now setting company standards. [chuckle] Mom's going to lose her mind when I tell her.
