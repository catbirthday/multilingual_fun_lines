Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] I just got the call. The pension fund, it's—they lost everything. [pause] I mean, literally everything. These are people's, um, their entire life savings, and I... [very quietly] I recommended the leveraged buyout. 

[anxious] The models were solid, you know? Like, I ran them fifty times. The debt ratios, the EBITDA multiples, they all—[trailing off] ...God, none of that matters now. [long pause] There's this woman, Margaret, she called the office. Eighty-three years old. [very sad] She was supposed to, er, move in with her daughter next month but now she can't afford... [sniffle] 

[bitter] My boss keeps saying it was "market conditions." Right. Market conditions. [sarcastic] Because that's what I'll tell Margaret—sorry your retirement got wiped out, but hey, market conditions, you know? 

[regretful] I should've flagged the risks harder. The thing is, I actually did write that one paragraph about, hmm, about the vulnerability to interest rate spikes, but it was—[frustrated] it was buried on page forty-seven. [pause] Who reads page forty-seven? 

[crying while speaking] These people worked their whole lives. Teachers, nurses, firefighters. And I just, with my stupid Excel models and my... [very quietly] I destroyed them.
