=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [exhausted] Three thousand units. Three thousand tiny valve components, each one perfect to, um, point zero zero two millimeters. [long pause] You know what gets me? [quietly] Each one of these goes into someone's heart. [anxious] Like, an actual human being is gonna—their life depends on me not screwing up the zinc alloy temperature by even half a degree. [nervous chuckle] No pressure, right?

[warm] I met this kid last week, actually. His mom brought him to the factory tour and she just... [emotional] she grabbed my hand and said "you made the part that's keeping him alive." [shaky voice] I almost lost it right there. This eight-year-old with this huge smile, and I'm thinking—[pause] I'm thinking about all those late nights checking tolerances, obsessing over every bubble in the casting. [proudly] Suddenly it all means something.

[frustrated] People think factory work is just, I don't know, mindless repetition? [sarcastic] Yeah, sure, tell that to the neurosurgeon waiting for my components. [passionately] Every single piece I cast could be the difference between someone's parent coming home or—[trailing off] 

[very sincerely] Tomorrow I'll make three thousand more. [determined] And they'll all be perfect. They have to be.
