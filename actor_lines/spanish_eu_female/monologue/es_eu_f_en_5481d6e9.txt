Subject: Your brass instrument repair business is failing because kids don't join band anymore

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [regretful] Twenty-three years I've been fixing trumpets and trombones. Twenty-three years. And now I'm sitting here with, what, maybe two repairs this whole week? [sigh] I used to have instruments lined up, you know, all along that back wall. September was crazy—kids dropping off their rentals, dents from summer, sticky valves... [pause] Now it's just quiet. [bitter] Nobody wants to join band anymore, apparently. It's all, um... it's all computers and coding clubs now. [frustrated] I mean, what happened? Music used to mean something! These kids, they don't even—they don't know what they're missing. The feeling of, hmm, nailing that high C for the first time, or playing at homecoming... [very melancholic] My dad taught me this trade. Passed down his tools, his techniques, everything. And I thought, you know, I thought I'd pass it down too. But to who? [shaky voice] There's nobody left who cares about brass. The school district's talking about, uh... about cutting music programs entirely next year. [long pause] Sometimes I just sit here polishing the same old tuba that nobody's coming to pick up, and I think... maybe it's time. Maybe I should just, I don't know, sell the shop and learn to fix phones or something. [trailing off] God, that's depressing...
