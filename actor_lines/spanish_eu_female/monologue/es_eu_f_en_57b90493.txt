Subject: Your critic review just launched an artist's career while destroying your mentor's gallery

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] I just saw the news. The gallery's closing. Marcus is... he's closing it. [pause] Twenty-three years, and my review just—God, I didn't mean for this to happen. I mean, I had to be honest about the show, right? The curation was, um... it was genuinely terrible. [regretful] But Marcus taught me everything. He literally gave me my first job, introduced me to everyone, and now I've just... [sigh] 

The thing is, Sophie's work deserved those words. She's brilliant, and she was being buried in that awful group show with all that, er, derivative garbage he insisted on including. [anxious] Now she's got three museums calling, which is amazing, but Marcus won't even answer my texts. 

[very quietly] Maybe I could've phrased it differently. I called his vision "catastrophically outdated." Those exact words. Who writes that about their mentor? [bitter] But then again, he knew what he was doing to those artists, keeping them in his stable, never letting them grow beyond his, hmm... his tiny little vision of what art should be. 

[confused] I don't know if I did the right thing. I really don't.
