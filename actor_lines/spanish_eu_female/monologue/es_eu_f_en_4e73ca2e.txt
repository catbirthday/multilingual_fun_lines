Subject: Discovering your production sound mixer work is being credited to someone who wasn't even there

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confused] Wait, that can't be right. [quickly] Let me refresh this page because I must be— no, it still says the same thing. [upset] They gave my sound mixing credit to Derek? [laugh] Derek wasn't even there! [frustrated] He was literally in Cabo that entire week posting beach selfies while I was pulling sixteen-hour days in that freezing warehouse. [angry] Are you kidding me right now? [pause] I recorded every single take, I dealt with the generator noise, I fixed the lav mics when they kept cutting out— [very loudly] I was the only sound person there! [shaky voice] Three weeks of work, and they just... erased me. [bitter] And of course it's Derek, who's golf buddies with the producer. [sarcastic] How convenient. [quietly] God, I feel so stupid for not getting it in writing. [frustrated] But you don't expect to have to, um, defend credits for work you actually did. [angry] I have the call sheets! [passionate] I have photos from set! [exhausted] I even have the original sound files with my metadata on them. [pause] Should I say something? [anxious] I mean, this could burn bridges, but this is my work. [determined] This is my actual career they're messing with. [sigh] I can't just let this go.
