[gasp loudly] Jake just—he literally just forwarded me the email and I'm, [stuttering] I-I-I can't even read it properly because my hands are shaking. [very excited] Five years, you know? Five years of playing dive bars and, like, birthday parties and that one terrible wedding where they made us play—anyway, [laugh hard] oh my God, we're opening for The Velvet Ghosts! [shouting] THE VELVET GHOSTS! \n\nI mean, these are the people whose posters I had, er, plastered all over my bedroom ceiling. [very quietly] I learned every single bass line from their first three albums. And honestly, the thing is, [speeding up] I never thought we were good enough, like we're just a cover band, we do other people's songs at bars where, hmm, half the crowd isn't even listening. [pause] But someone saw us. [warm] Someone actually saw us at that crappy venue last month and thought—[chuckle] I guess they thought we were worth something.\n\n[anxious] What if I forget how to play? Like, what if I just, [whispering] completely blank out on stage? No, stop it, stop—[confidently] we've earned this, right? All those late night rehearsals in Jake's garage, basically annoying his neighbors until 2 AM. [sniffle] My mom always said, um, she said keep playing and doors will open. [extremely happy] This door just got blown off its hinges!"
