Speaker [en]: She was doing so well. I mean, [very quietly] three months clean, going to meetings, actually showing up, you know? [pause] We talked last week about her new job and she was, like—God, she was [shaky voice] laughing about her manager being this total control freak. [bitter] And now I'm standing here looking at her file thinking what the hell did I miss?

[confused] The thing is, um, there weren't any signs. Or maybe—[frustrated] maybe I just didn't want to see them? She kept her appointments, er, she was taking her Suboxone, honestly everything pointed to... [trailing off] 

[crying while speaking] I told her mom she was doing great. Actually used those exact words. "She's doing great." [long pause] 

[angry] This fucking disease, it just—it doesn't care that you're trying, you know? Doesn't care that you've got a job now or that your kids are finally talking to you again. [very sad] Sarah had her daughter's school play next week. She bought a dress for it. A dress. [sniffle]

[regretful] I keep thinking maybe if I'd, uh, called her over the weekend or suggested more frequent check-ins or—[exhausted] but that's not how this works, right? I mean, I know that. Intellectually. [very melancholic] Doesn't make it any easier though. Twenty-three years old. [whispering] Twenty-three.
