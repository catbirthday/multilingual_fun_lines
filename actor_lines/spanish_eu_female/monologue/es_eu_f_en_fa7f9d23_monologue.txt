Speaker [en]: [anxious] They said—Marcus just said he can't... [pause] he can't work with me anymore. [shaky voice] Because of my anxiety. My anxiety is affecting patient care, that's what he said. [bitter] Twenty years, twenty years in emergency medicine and suddenly I'm, what, [frustrated] a liability? I mean, yes, I've been double-checking medications more, triple-checking actually, but that's being thorough, [defensive speeding up] that's being careful, that's what we're supposed to do, right? [pause] 

[quietly] Except... [sigh] last week with that cardiac patient, I froze for like, [very slowly] three whole seconds before intubating. [gasp softly] Three seconds. In the ER that's... [trailing off] And the tremor in my hands when I was placing that central line, um, everyone saw that. [very sad] Marcus covered for me, said I had too much coffee, but we both knew. [pause] 

[crying while speaking] Maybe he's right. God, maybe—maybe I'm putting people at risk. [shaky voice] How did I get here? I used to be so steady, so confident, [nostalgic mumbling] adrenaline was my friend, not this thing that makes my chest feel like it's—[gasp] 

[exhausted] I should take leave. [long pause] Before someone actually gets hurt because I'm too anxious to function in my own ER. [sniffle] Marcus was being kind, actually. [very quietly] He was protecting everyone. Including me.
