Scenario: locked out of their account after too many failed password attempts

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So basically I'm locked out and like, I tried my password five times already.

Customer Support [en]: Oh I see, um, let me pull up your account here... hmm, what's the email associated with it?

Customer [en]: It's sarah.chen at gmail, and like I really need to get in.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, account AC-7742-B. Yeah I can see the lockout here, er, five attempts in... wow, three minutes. Let me check what's the... what's the word... the protocol for this.

Customer [en]: *exhales* Look, basically I just need this fixed fast, I have a meeting.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so the thing is, uh, normally we'd send a reset link to your email but I'm seeing here that your recovery email bounces back—error code E401X—so let me think what else we can... hmm, okay actually I have an idea.

Customer [en]: Wait, my recovery email is broken too? Since when?

Customer Support [en]: Shows disconnected as of, er, October 12th. But here's what I can do—I'll verify you through security questions, then basically unlock it right now instead of the usual 24-hour wait period.

Customer [en]: Oh! Like right now right now? That would actually be amazing.

Customer Support [en]: Yep, immediate unlock. So first question, uh, let me see here... what's the name of your first pet?

Customer [en]: Basically it was Mr. Whiskers, so that's the answer.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, and... hmm, your first car make and model?

Customer [en]: Honda Civic, like the 2012 one.

Customer Support [en]: Great great. Last one—ZIP code when you opened the account in 2019?

Customer [en]: So that would be... *sharp inhale* oh wait, 94102, yeah definitely.

Customer Support [en]: Excellent! Okay so, um, I'm unlocking it now... just need to... there. Account AC-7742-B is active again. What I'm also gonna do is, er, generate you a temporary password—ready to write this down?

Customer [en]: Wait really? It's done? Yes yes, so ready for the password!

Customer Support [en]: It's TEMP-8847-DELTA-3. All caps except the numbers obviously. You'll need to change it when you log in, but uh, that'll get you in right now.

Customer [en]: This is so much better than I expected, like seriously, thank you!

Customer Support [en]: No problem! Oh and, hmm, one more thing—I've added a backup authentication method using your phone ending in 7823, just so you don't get locked out again. Should be all set now.
