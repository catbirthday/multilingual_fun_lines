=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Okay so I've got three orders—wait, four actually—lemme see here, can you combine those for shipping?

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely! Yeah, I just did this myself last week actually... Let me pull up your account real quick. Can you give me the first order number?

Customer [en]: Yes! Thank you! It's—hmm, what if—okay first one's BX4921K.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. BX4921K shows processing since 9:47 AM this morning. Still plenty of time to combine... What else you got?

Customer [en]: Perfect, yes, then MQ8832F and—wait that's so helpful—also RZ1147D.

Customer Support [en]: *exhales* Okay, good news. MQ8832F and RZ1147D are both still in fulfillment stage... I can merge all three into shipment ID SHIP-7764-XK91. Save you about eighteen bucks.

Customer [en]: Eighteen! That's amazing! Oh and the fourth one—lemme think—PL5509W?

Customer Support [en]: PL5509W... *sharp inhale* Ah. That one already left the warehouse at 6:22 AM. But hey, true story? Same thing happened to me last month and...

Customer [en]: Oh. Right. Makes sense. Still though, three combined, that's great, really great.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, the three I got merged will arrive together Tuesday. Tracking SHIP-7764-XK91. You know what though... Let me check something for that fourth one...

Customer [en]: You're being so helpful, seriously, I really appreciate you taking time with this.

Customer Support [en]: Found something. Your fourth package, PL5509W? If I reroute it to arrive same day as the others, Tuesday by 3:00 PM, at least they all come together...

Customer [en]: Yes! Please! That's perfect—okay so that means everything Tuesday then?

Customer Support [en]: Everything Tuesday. Combined shipment SHIP-7764-XK91 and rerouted PL5509W both scheduled for March 19th before 3:00 PM. Saved you money and trips to the door.

Customer [en]: This is exactly what I needed. Thank you. Really. I just... I can't...

Customer Support [en]: *soft exhale* Hey, I get it. Multiple deliveries are... Listen, I'm adding a note to your account, reference code NOTE-8847-QM, for five dollars credit too.

Customer [en]: Five dollar credit too? You're incredible. Seriously. Thank you so much.

Customer Support [en]: Just doing what I'd want someone to do for me, you know? Final confirmation number for all changes is CNF-2298-BK71... Is there anything else that might make this easier?

Customer [en]: No, this is—you fixed everything. All of it. Tuesday. One day. I'm just... thank you.

Customer Support [en]: Good. Really glad we got it sorted... Oh, and satisfaction survey comes through in about ten minutes, reference number SRV-4429-XL. But honestly? Just happy to help.
