[pause] Everyone wants the young ones, लेकिन ये बूढ़ी आत्माएं? [passionate] They understand what rescue means. जो कुछ भी उनके पास बचा है, उस पूरे दिल से प्यार करती हैं। [crying while speaking] God, I miss him so much. बहुत याद आता है वो।"

Can you imagine? \n\n[sad] The first week was, um... it was rough, honestly. He wouldn't eat. [sniffle] Just laid in the corner like he was waiting to be sent back. And I thought, oh God, maybe I made a mistake? Maybe he needed someone who, I don't know, knew what they were doing? \n\n[softly] But then one morning, he just... he climbed onto the couch next to me. [gasp softly] Not touching, but close. And we sat there watching TV and I could feel him, err, slowly relaxing. Week by week, he started trusting me. \n\n[very sincerely] You know what? Those three years we had together before he passed were the best years of my life. [cry] He taught me about, mmm, about patience and unconditional love and... [pause] Everyone wants the young ones, but these old souls? [passionate] They know what it means to be saved. They love you with everything they've got left.
