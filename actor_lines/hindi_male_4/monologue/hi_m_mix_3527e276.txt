Subject: Your compensation consultant advice led to mass layoffs that you never saw coming

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [shocked] अभी-अभी email आया है। 87 लोगों को निकाल दिया... सत्तासी। [long pause] बार-बार यह number पढ़ रहा हूं क्योंकि यह... यह सच नहीं लग रहा। [shaky voice] मैंने तो बस senior roles के लिए market-rate adjustments suggest किए थे। यही काम के लिए तो मुझे hire किया था ना? To make sure the compensation was competitive? [pause] लेकिन मैं... अम्म... मैंने यह नहीं सोचा था कि बाकी सबके budget का क्या होगा जब... [trailing off]

[regretful] हे भगवान, मुझे पहले समझना चाहिए था। वो बार-बार "efficiency ratios" के बारे में पूछ रहे थे, and I just thought it was normal corporate speak, you know? लेकिन अब Jenny जो accounts में थी, वो... वो चली गई। [upset] तीन बच्चे हैं उसके, अभी-अभी घर खरीदा था। और Marcus, उसकी retirement में सिर्फ दो साल बाकी थे। सिर्फ दो साल। [pause]

[frustrated] बात यह है कि उन्होंने मेरी report को हथियार की तरह इस्तेमाल किया। मैंने कहा था "consider" करो executive pay adjust करने को, और उन्होंने... पूरे के पूरे departments ही खत्म कर दिए। [bitter] "Strategic restructuring" बोल रहे थे। [sigh] मेरा मतलब, मुझे कैसे पता चलता कि वो पांच executives को ज्यादा pay करने के लिए... अम्म... उन सबको निकाल देंगे जो actually काम करते हैं?

[very quietly] मुझसे अब यह job नहीं होगा। यह जानते हुए कि मेरी spreadsheet, मेरी recommendations ने... [shaky voice] लोगों की जिंदगियां बर्बाद कर दीं। [long pause] और सबसे बुरी बात? They're actually thanking me for the "excellent analysis." [very sad] Excellent.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [shocked] I just got the email. They let go of... of eighty-seven people. Eighty-seven. [long pause] I keep reading the number over and over because it doesn't—it doesn't feel real. [shaky voice] All I did was suggest market-rate adjustments for the senior roles. That's what they hired me for, right? To make sure the compensation was competitive? [pause] But I guess, um... I guess I didn't think about what would happen to everyone else's budget when... [trailing off]

[regretful] God, I should have seen this coming. They kept asking about "efficiency ratios" and I just thought, well, that's normal corporate speak, you know? But now Jenny from accounting, she's—she's gone. [upset] Three kids, just bought a house. And Marcus, he was two years from retirement. Two years. [pause]

[frustrated] The thing is, they used my report like a weapon. I said "consider" adjusting executive pay and they just... they gutted entire departments instead. [bitter] "Strategic restructuring," they called it. [sigh] I mean, how was I supposed to know they'd choose to pay five executives more by firing, um... by firing everyone who actually does the work?

[very quietly] I don't think I can do this job anymore. Knowing that my spreadsheet, my recommendations... [shaky voice] they destroyed people's lives. [long pause] And the worst part? They're thanking me for the "excellent analysis." [very sad] Excellent.
