[laugh] \n\nI mean, I should be thrilled, right? This is what I wanted. [hesitantly] But I keep thinking about all those years. All those brutal reviews that made me, um... made me question if I even belonged here. [sigh] God, I used to print them out and study them, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Lost so much sleep over his opinion. [quietly] And now he's comparing me to Sondheim. \n\n[frustrated] Part of me wants to email him and ask what changed. Was it me or was it him? [pause] But I know that's petty. [slowly] Maybe we both evolved. Maybe I finally wrote something that spoke his language, or maybe he finally learned mine. [relieved] Either way, it's in the Times tomorrow. Mom's already called twice. [chuckle] I guess this is what vindication feels like—it's more complicated than I expected."
