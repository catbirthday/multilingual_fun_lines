Speaker [en]: [anxious] I keep checking my phone even though I know nothing's changed. It's been three hours since the interview and they said they'd call today, but... I don't know, maybe they meant tomorrow? [pause] God, I probably bombed that last question about conflict resolution. I just completely blanked and started rambling about my cat. [laugh] Who talks about their cat in a job interview? [frustrated] I mean, I thought it was a decent metaphor at the time, but now I'm replaying it and— [groan] yeah, no, that was terrible. They probably think I'm completely unhinged. [sigh] The thing is, I really need this job. Like, um, not just want it, but actually need it. My lease is up next month and if I don't have something lined up... [trailing off] I can't move back in with my parents. I just can't. [very quietly] Wait, is that my phone buzzing? [pause] Oh my god, it's them. It's actually them calling. [shaky voice] Okay. Okay, this is it. [deep breath] Just be cool, be professional, don't mention cats. [nervously] Here goes nothing. Hello?
