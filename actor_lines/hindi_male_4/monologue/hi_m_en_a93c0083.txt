Subject: Your meter technician precision helping solve a neighborhood mystery about mysterious utility bills

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [curious] Okay, so you know how everyone on Maple Street's been getting those insane bills? Well, I've been checking meters for, what, fifteen years now, and something's been bugging me about this whole thing. [pause] I kept thinking... why would five houses in a row all spike at the exact same time? That's not, um, that's not normal wear and tear, you know? 

[excited] So today I'm checking Mrs. Chen's meter and I notice—wait, this is where it gets weird—the seal's been tampered with. Not obviously, but there's these tiny scratches that shouldn't be there. [speeding up] And then I check the Johnsons', same thing, exact same marks. 

[slowly] Now here's what I think happened... someone's been, uh, someone's been reversing the meters at night, then putting them back to normal before the monthly reading. But they messed up last month, left them running forward at double speed. [pause] 

[confidently] The thing is, I recognize the tool marks. It's this specific bypass key that only, hmm... only contractors from that new development would have. [sigh] I mean, I can't prove it yet, but I'm betting someone was stealing power for their construction site and accidentally, well, essentially screwed over the whole neighborhood instead. 

[relieved] At least now we know people aren't going crazy about their bills.
