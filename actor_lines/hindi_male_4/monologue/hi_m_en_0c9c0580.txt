=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] They actually did it. They went to a judge and everything. Said I was a "danger to the children" because of my work history. [pause] Twenty years of keeping this family afloat, and this is what I get? I never brought that life home, never once. The kids don't even know what grandpa did for money. [frustrated] All they know is I took them fishing, taught them card games, made them pancakes every Sunday morning when they visited. [sigh] But Sandra found out about Kandahar. Found out about, um... about the other contracts too. [quietly] And now she's convinced I'm some kind of monster. Like I enjoyed it or something. Like I had choices back then. [angry] What was I supposed to do, let us lose the house? Let her dad die without his treatments? [pause] I did what I had to do to keep everyone safe, everyone fed. [voice breaking] And now I can't even... I can't see Emma's piano recital next month. Won't be there when little Marcus learns to ride his bike. [very sad] They're going to grow up thinking grandpa just disappeared. That I didn't want them. [long pause] How do I explain that everything I did was for them?
