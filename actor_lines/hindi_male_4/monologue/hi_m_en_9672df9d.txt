Subject: The domestic violence advocate certification allowing you to open your own nonprofit helping survivors rebuild their lives

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] It's here. The certification is actually here. [pause] I keep staring at it like it's gonna disappear or something. [laugh] God, I can't believe... after everything, I can actually open my own nonprofit now. [very slowly] My own place to help survivors. [sniffle]

You know, when I started this journey, I was just... I was so broken myself. [quietly] Three years out of my own situation and I thought, um, maybe I could turn this pain into something. [clearing throat] But sitting in those training sessions, hearing all these stories, learning about trauma responses and safety planning... [exhales] Jesus, some nights I'd just sit in my car afterwards and cry. [emotional]

But then I'd think about Sarah—remember her? [warm] The first woman I helped during my practicum. She said I, erm... she said I gave her hope when she had none. [pause] That's when I knew. This is what I'm supposed to do. [confidently]

And now I can actually—I mean, I can create a real space. [excited] Not just referrals and hotlines but like, actual rebuilding programs. Job training, childcare, legal advocacy, all of it under one roof. [passionately] The kind of place I wish had existed when I needed it. [long pause]

Tomorrow I start looking for a building. [determined] We're really doing this.
