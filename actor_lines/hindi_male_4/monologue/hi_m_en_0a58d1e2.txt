Subject: The chimney sweep business your grandfather built is going under because of environmental regulations

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] Seventy-three years. That's how long Grandpa's chimney sweep business has been running, and now it's just... done. [frustrated] These new environmental regulations are the final nail in the coffin, you know? We can't afford the equipment upgrades they're demanding. Twenty thousand dollars for new vacuum systems, another fifteen for—it doesn't even matter. [sigh] The numbers are impossible.

[sad] I keep thinking about Grandpa starting this whole thing with just his brushes and a ladder. Built it from nothing. Fed three generations of our family. [pause] And now I'm the one who has to shut it down? [shaky voice] God, he'd be so disappointed in me.

[angry] The worst part is they act like we're some kind of, I don't know, environmental criminals or something. We clean chimneys! We prevent house fires! We're literally making homes safer, but no—suddenly we're the bad guys because of some particles in the air that, um... that nobody even noticed for seven decades. 

[very melancholic] I walked through the shop yesterday, looked at all his old tools still hanging there. His name's still painted on the door. [trailing off] Joseph Fletcher & Sons, established 1951... 

[quietly] I guess I'll have to paint over that now.
