=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confused] I just read it three times. Marcus Whitfield—the Marcus Whitfield who called my last piece "amateur hour" and said I had the subtlety of a sledgehammer—he just... he loved it. [pause] Five stars. Called it "transcendent." Used the word "masterful." This is the same man who once wrote that my dialogue sounded like it was generated by AI. [bitter] And now suddenly I'm a genius? [laugh] 

I mean, I should be thrilled, right? This is what I wanted. [hesitantly] But I keep thinking about all those years. All those brutal reviews that made me, um... made me question if I even belonged here. [sigh] God, I used to print them out and study them, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Lost so much sleep over his opinion. [quietly] And now he's comparing me to Sondheim. 

[frustrated] Part of me wants to email him and ask what changed. Was it me or was it him? [pause] But I know that's petty. [slowly] Maybe we both evolved. Maybe I finally wrote something that spoke his language, or maybe he finally learned mine. [relieved] Either way, it's in the Times tomorrow. Mom's already called twice. [chuckle] I guess this is what vindication feels like—it's more complicated than I expected.
