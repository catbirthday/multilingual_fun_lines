=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [stunned] सारा? क्या सच में तुम हो?

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] अरे भाई, एलेक्स! यकीन नहीं हो रहा कि तुम यहाँ scrubs में खड़े हो, looking all, अम्म, professional and everything. [nervous laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter smile] हाँ, वैसे, professional is a relative term, जब तुम tissue samples के डिब्बों के पास खड़े हो जो, अ, basically मर रहे हैं क्योंकि किसी की supply chain बिलकुल बिखर गई है।

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] ठीक है, देखो, मुझे पता है तुम frustrated हो और मैं पूरी तरह समझता हूँ क्यों, but this isn't just, जैसे, मेरी तरफ से कोई random गड़बड़ नहीं है, ठीक है? पूरे eastern corridor में वो storm system आया था।

Character 1 [mix]: [incredulous] Storm system? सारा, ये cancer research samples की बात हो रही है यार, not, मेरा मतलब, office supplies नहीं या जो भी तुम आजकल plan करते हो।

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] यह actually fair नहीं है, और पता है क्या? मैं सोलह घंटे काम कर रहा हूँ trying to, अ, सब कुछ alternative channels से reroute करने के लिए, because I do understand how critical this is. [exhales]

Character 1 [mix]: [softening slightly] मैं बस—देखो, हमारे पास families हैं जो इन test results का इंतज़ार कर रही हैं, and every hour that passes is, अम्म, basically एक और बातचीत जो मुझे करनी पड़ती है delays के बारे में जो होनी ही नहीं चाहिए।

Character 2 [mix]: [hopeful energy] सुनो, अगर मैं बताऊं कि मेरे पास एक solution हो सकता है? Baltimore में एक supplier है जो मुझ पर एक एहसान करता है, and they've got, हम्म, शायद सत्तर percent जो तुम्हें चाहिए आज रात ship करने को तैयार है।

Character 1 [mix]: सत्तर percent काम नहीं करेगा लेकिन, है ना? हमें सब कुछ चाहिए, या पूरा research protocol गड़बड़ हो जाएगा और हम वापस, अ, square one पर पहुँच जाएंगे with these patients waiting even longer.

Character 2 [mix]: [determined] तो मैं करूंगा, ठीक है? मुझे दो घंटे दो हर favor call करने के लिए जो मेरे पास है, because honestly, तुम्हें यहाँ ऐसे देखना, all stressed and, अ, disappointed—ये मुझे मार रहा है।

Character 1 [mix]: [wistful] तुम हमेशा सब कुछ ठीक करने की कोशिश करते थे, college में भी जब तुम, जैसे, पूरा dorm room reorganize कर देते थे because I mentioned once कि मुझे मेरी textbooks नहीं मिल रही थीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [laughing softly] भगवान, मैं कितना असहनीय था, है ना? But hey, तुम्हें हमेशा अपनी textbooks मिल जाती थीं उसके बाद, so maybe my system actually worked, right?

Character 1 [mix]: [warming up] तुम्हारा system definitely काम करता था, वो मैं मानता हूँ। बस, अम्म, इस बार हम textbooks की बात नहीं कर रहे, we're talking about people's actual lives here.

Character 2 [mix]: [earnestly] इसीलिए मैं इस hospital से नहीं जाऊंगा until we've got every single vial and slide you need, चाहे मुझे खुद Baltimore आज रात drive करना पड़े। [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] तुम सच में ऐसा करोगे? इतने सालों तक बात न करने के बाद, you'd just, मेरा मतलब, सब कुछ छोड़कर मेरी मदद करोगे इस mess में?

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] ये सिर्फ तुम्हारी मदद के बारे में नहीं है, though that's, अम्म, definitely एक हिस्सा है। ये samples matter करते हैं, और मैंने इस job में काफी सीखा है to know when something's truly critical. [sighs]

Character 1 [mix]: [grateful whisper] मुझे सच में miss करता था किसी ऐसे व्यक्ति को जो बस, जैसे, समझ जाता है without me having to explain कि इस तरह के काम में हर minute क्यों count करता है।

Character 2 [mix]: [tender smile in voice] वैसे, तुम्हारे लिए lucky है, मैं supply chains के साथ miracles करने में pretty good हो गया हूँ, so let me work my magic जब तक तुम, अ, जाओ lives बचाओ या जो भी तुम करते हो। [chuckles]

Character 1 [mix]: ठीक है, but only if you promise कि हम actually वो coffee पीएंगे जिसके बारे में हम कह रहे हैं, क्या, पाँच सालों से? और सिर्फ hospital cafeteria coffee नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: Deal, लेकिन तुम pay करोगे क्योंकि तुमने अभी मुझ पर cancer research बर्बाद करने का आरोप लगाया, which, honestly, सबसे dramatic चीज़ है जिसके लिए किसी ने मुझे blame किया है मेरे पूरे logistics career में।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [stunned] Sarah? Is that really you?

Character 2: [warmly] Oh my god, Alex! I can't believe it's actually you standing here in scrubs, looking all, um, professional and everything. [nervous laugh]

Character 1: [bitter smile] Yeah, well, professional is a relative term when you're standing next to boxes of tissue samples that are, uh, basically dying because somebody's supply chain apparently fell apart.

Character 2: [defensive] Okay, look, I know you're frustrated and I completely understand why, but this isn't just, like, some random screw-up on my end, alright? The whole eastern corridor got hit with that storm system.

Character 1: [incredulous] A storm system? Sarah, these are cancer research samples we're talking about here, not, I mean, not office supplies or whatever you usually plan for these days.

Character 2: [firmly] That's actually not fair, and you know what? I've been working sixteen-hour days trying to, err, reroute everything through alternative channels because I do understand how critical this is. [exhales]

Character 1: [softening slightly] I just—look, we've got families waiting on these test results, and every hour that passes is, um, basically another conversation I have to have about delays that shouldn't be happening.

Character 2: [hopeful energy] Listen, what if I told you I might have a solution? There's a supplier in Baltimore who owes me a favor, and they've got, hmm, maybe seventy percent of what you need ready to ship tonight.

Character 1: Seventy percent isn't going to cut it though, is it? We need all of it, or the whole research protocol gets thrown off and we're back to, uh, square one with these patients waiting even longer.

Character 2: [determined] Then I'll make it happen, okay? Give me two hours to call in every favor I've got, because honestly, seeing you here like this, all stressed and, err, disappointed—it's killing me.

Character 1: [wistful] You always did try to fix everything, even back in college when you'd, like, reorganize our entire dorm room because I mentioned once that I couldn't find my textbooks.

Character 2: [laughing softly] God, I was insufferable, wasn't I? But hey, you always found your textbooks after that, so maybe my system actually worked, right?

Character 1: [warming up] Your system definitely worked, I'll give you that. It's just, um, this time we're not talking about textbooks, we're talking about people's actual lives here.

Character 2: [earnestly] Which is exactly why I'm not leaving this hospital until we've got every single vial and slide you need, even if I have to drive to Baltimore myself tonight. [pause]

Character 1: [surprised] You'd really do that? After all these years of not talking, you'd just, I mean, drop everything to help me out with this mess?

Character 2: [gently] It's not just about helping you, though that's, um, definitely part of it. These samples matter, and I've learned enough in this job to know when something's truly critical. [sighs]

Character 1: [grateful whisper] I really missed having someone who just, like, gets it without me having to explain why every minute counts in this kind of work.

Character 2: [tender smile in voice] Well, lucky for you, I've gotten pretty good at making miracles happen with supply chains, so let me work my magic while you, uh, go save lives or whatever it is you do. [chuckles]

Character 1: Alright, but only if you promise we'll actually grab that coffee we've been saying we'd get for, what, five years now? And not just quick hospital cafeteria coffee either.

Character 2: Deal, but you're buying since you just accused me of ruining your cancer research, which, honestly, is probably the most dramatic thing anyone's ever blamed me for in my entire logistics career.
