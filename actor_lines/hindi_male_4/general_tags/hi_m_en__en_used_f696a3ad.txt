Scenario: The omega of a failing wolf pack confronts the plunderer who has been stealing their winter food stores, only to discover it's her own exiled sister.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Maya? That's you raiding our stores? Christ, I tracked you for three miles through the snow thinking I'd find some desperate loner, not my own sister stealing from starving pups.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter laugh] Starving pups? That's rich coming from the pack that cast me out during the worst winter in decades. You want to talk about desperate? Try living alone out here with nothing.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly seething] You know exactly why you were exiled, Maya. You challenged the alpha during breeding season and nearly killed two juveniles in your rage. The pack had no choice.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I was protecting my position, something you'd never understand as the eternal omega. Always accepting your place at the bottom, taking whatever scraps they throw you.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] At least I have a pack to belong to. Look at you—you're skin and bones, your coat's falling out in patches, and you're stealing cached meat meant for nursing mothers.

Character 2 [en]: Those nursing mothers voted for my exile. [exhales] Every single one of them turned their backs when I was driven into the wilderness. Why should I care if their pups go hungry?

Character 1 [en]: Because those pups are your blood too, Maya. Your nephew, your cousins—they're innocent in all this, and they're dying because someone keeps taking what little we've managed to hunt.

Character 2 [en]: [hollow] Innocent. That's what I thought I was too, until the pack decided otherwise. You know what it's like out here alone? No hunts, no warmth, just endless cold and hunger.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] I've been leaving kills at the border for you. Small ones the pack wouldn't miss—rabbits, the occasional bird. Did you never wonder who was providing those?

Character 2 [en]: [voice breaking] That was you? I thought maybe it was just luck, or some hunter's forgotten cache. [pause] Why would you risk that for me?

Character 1 [en]: [wistful] Because before you were the exile, you were my sister. The one who taught me to track, who fought off three coyotes when I was just a pup. That matters more than pack law.

Character 2 [en]: [struggling] Don't do this to me, Lena. Don't make me remember what it felt like to belong somewhere, to have family. It's easier to just be the monster they painted me as.

Character 1 [en]: [urgently] Stop taking from the main caches.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] And then what? Continue my slow starvation on rabbits and charity? You know that's not enough to survive a winter this harsh, especially not alone. [quieter] I'm already dying, Lena.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] There's another way. The pack's moving to the southern valley next week for better hunting grounds. If you follow at a distance, take only what I leave for you...

Character 2 [en]: [cautious hope] You're asking me to shadow the pack? They'll kill me if they catch my scent, you know that. The alpha made it very clear what happens if I come within five miles.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] The alpha's gotten old, Maya. His nose isn't what it used to be, and I'm the one who scouts the perimeter now. I can make sure certain areas go unchecked.

Character 2 [en]: You'd betray your pack for me? The omega, protecting the exile—if they found out, they'd cast you out too, or worse. [sighs] We'd both end up as cautionary tales.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] Maybe. Or maybe we'd survive together, the way we did when we were pups. Either way, I'm not letting you die out here alone while I have the power to prevent it. [firm] Family is family.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional whisper] I don't deserve this kindness, not after everything. [stronger] But I'll take it. I'll follow at a distance, take only what you leave. And Lena? Thank you for not giving up on me.
