=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [measured] So, uh, you wanted to check on the holster order? Because honestly, I wasn't expecting you back until next week when it's actually finished.

Character 2 [en]: [casually] Yeah, well, I was in the neighborhood and figured I'd stop by, see how it's coming along. You know how it is, sometimes plans change. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] Right, plans change. Um, the thing is, I've been getting some interesting requests lately from other customers about, well, similar work.

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah? That's good for business, right? I mean, custom leather work like yours, it's not exactly common anymore, so word must be spreading about your craftsmanship.

Character 1 [en]: [quieter] The Serpents came by yesterday, actually. Three of them. They were, uh, very interested in who else shops here, especially anyone ordering concealed carry gear. [nervous exhale]

Character 2 [en]: [controlled] Hmm, that must've been uncomfortable for you. Those guys can be pretty intense when they want information about something. What did you tell them?

Character 1 [en]: [strained] Nothing, I mean, I told them nothing specific, but they're not stupid, you know? They saw your order form on my bench before I could cover it up.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] I see.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] Look, I don't know what you're really doing here, okay? But whatever it is, I've got a family, and these guys, they don't just threaten, they actually follow through on that shit. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: Hey, listen to me, alright? Nobody's asking you to get involved in anything. You're just making a holster, that's all this needs to be. [deliberate pause]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] Just making a holster. Right. Except your measurements are for a Glock 19, and I know for a fact that's not what the Serpents carry because I've made holsters for half of them.

Character 2 [en]: [deflecting] People carry different pieces for different occasions. That's not really unusual in certain circles, and I think you know that. [clears throat]

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] You're going to get me killed, aren't you? My wife, she was right, I should've closed shop when the Serpents first started coming around two years ago.

Character 2 [en]: Nobody's getting hurt here, okay? I need you to trust me on this, even if I can't explain everything right now. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Trust you. Sure. The guy with the fake name on his order form wants me to trust him while my regular customers are asking questions I can't answer.

Character 2 [en]: Can't answer yet.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated whisper] Whatever.

Character 2 [en]: Look, um, finish the holster by Friday instead of next week, and I'll pay triple your rate. After that, maybe you take a vacation for a while, yeah? [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [drained] A vacation. With what money? You think triple rate on one holster is going to replace six months of lost business when word gets out I'm mixed up in... whatever this is?

Character 2 [en]: [quietly firm] When this is over, and it will be over soon, you'll have more business than you know what to do with. The right kind of business. [long pause] That's all I can say.
