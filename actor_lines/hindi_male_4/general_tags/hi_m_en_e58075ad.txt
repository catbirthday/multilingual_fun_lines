Scenario: A tour manager arrives at a corporate raider's office to negotiate the sale of a legendary music venue their late father built, desperate to save their touring company from bankruptcy.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] The Fillmore East tribute venue, forty years of music history, and I'm here begging you to buy it just to keep thirty touring acts from bankruptcy.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Your father built that place with his bare hands, didn't he? I remember reading about him turning an old warehouse into what became the soul of this city's music scene.

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] He used to say the walls absorbed every note ever played there, that you could feel Hendrix's guitar still vibrating in the beams if you listened close enough.

Character 2 [en]: [calculating] The property's worth twelve million for the land alone, but you're asking eight, which tells me you're drowning faster than I thought. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Three weeks left.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] You know I'm going to tear it down, right? It'll be luxury condos by next summer, maybe keep the original sign as some boutique hotel decoration.

Character 1 [en]: The bands I manage, they've all played that stage, some of them got discovered there, and now I'm the one signing their death warrant because I couldn't keep the books balanced.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] This is business, not sentiment—I buy distressed assets and maximize their value, and your emotional attachment doesn't change the mathematics of this deal.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] My father would've burned it down himself before letting someone like you touch it, but here I am with the papers already drawn up.

Character 2 [en]: Someone like me.

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] Last month I stood on that stage alone at three AM, and I could hear every concert we ever hosted echoing back, like the building knew what was coming.

Character 2 [en]: [unexpectedly gentle] My first date was at your venue, actually—1987, some punk band I can't remember, but I remember how alive that place felt, how it seemed to breathe music.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You went to shows there? I never would've pictured you in that crowd, with the leather jackets and safety pins, [exhales], moshing to The Dead Kennedys or whoever.

Character 2 [en]: I wasn't always this person, you know—there was a time when I believed in things that couldn't be monetized, when art mattered more than square footage.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly desperate] Then you understand what you're destroying, not just a building but a living thing that's been the heartbeat of this city's underground scene for decades.

Character 2 [en]: Understanding and caring are different things entirely—I understand perfectly, which is why I know exactly how much you'll accept when you have no other choice. [cold]

Character 1 [en]: [cracking] Six-point-five million, and you let me remove the original soundboard my father installed, the one Springsteen played through in '74 before anyone knew his name.

Character 2 [en]: [final] Seven million, you can take the soundboard, and we close tomorrow before you convince yourself there's another way out of this. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [barely breathing] Deal.

Character 2 [en]: I'll have mercy—one final show, tonight, before we take possession tomorrow. Make it count. [standing to leave]
