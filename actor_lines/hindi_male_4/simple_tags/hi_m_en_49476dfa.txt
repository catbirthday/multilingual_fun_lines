Scenario: A rotoscope artist discovers the person they've been digitally erasing from surveillance footage for months has tracked them down to their studio, desperate and on the run.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] You're the one I've been erasing from all that footage. [pause] Every single frame for the past four months, removing your face, your shadow, even your reflection in windows and car hoods.

Character 2 [en]: [frantically] They told me you were just some tech contractor who wouldn't ask questions. [breathing heavily] But you know exactly what you've been doing, don't you? [quieter] You know why I need to disappear.

Character 1 [en]: The timestamps on those videos, they're from banks, airports, train stations across three different states. [exhales] Whatever you're running from has serious resources if they're pulling that much surveillance.

Character 2 [en]: [desperately] Listen, I need you to understand something about the work you've been doing. [voice shaking] Those aren't just random locations, they're following a pattern, tracking everywhere I've been since I testified.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Testified? [pause] They told me this was for witness protection, that I was helping keep someone safe by making them invisible in the digital record.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Witness protection doesn't hire freelance rotoscope artists off the dark web. [laughs hysterically] They don't pay in cryptocurrency or leave dead drops with encrypted hard drives in subway lockers. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] So who exactly have I been working for these past four months? [speeding up] Because now you're here in my studio and I'm thinking I've been helping the wrong people find you.

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] The same people who killed my entire team after we uncovered their operation. [quietly] They're using you to clean up the trail, making sure when they finally get to me, there's no evidence I ever existed.

Character 1 [en]: But that doesn't make sense, if they wanted you gone, why spend all this money having me erase you from footage instead of just [pause] using it to track you down?

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Because dead whistleblowers become martyrs, but disappeared ones just become conspiracy theories that nobody believes. [exhales] They need me to vanish completely, no trace, no questions.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] There's something you should know about the work I've been doing. [clearing throat] I always keep personal backups of the original footage before I alter it, it's just professional habit from years of client revisions. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [gasps loudly] You have copies of everything? [very quickly] Four months of unedited surveillance showing everywhere I've been, everyone I've met, every safe house I thought was secure?

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Encrypted and offline, stored in a safety deposit box that only I can access. [quietly] I had a feeling something was off about this job from the start, the pay was too good and the security protocols were paranoid even by my standards.

Character 2 [en]: God. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] We can use those originals to prove you exist, create a digital paper trail they can't deny. [speeding up] But we need to move fast because if they realize you found me, this studio becomes a target.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I'm so tired of running, of looking over my shoulder every second, of not knowing who to trust. [sighs] Six months ago I was just an accountant who noticed irregular transfers.

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] Then we stop running and start fighting back. [firmly] I've got the technical skills to reverse everything I've done, splice you back into every frame with timestamps they can't dispute. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: You'd risk everything for someone you've never even met until today? [coughs] Your life, your career, all for a stranger who showed up desperate at your door?

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] I've spent four months carefully erasing a human being from existence, and that's been eating at me more than you know. [quietly] Maybe helping you come back to life is how I make this right.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I don't even remember what it feels like to have someone on my side. [exhales] Everyone else is either dead or too scared to help. [sniffle]
