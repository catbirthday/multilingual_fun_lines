=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Emma, I just saw the withdrawal form on my desk for next month's regional championships, and I'm, um, honestly confused because you've been training for this specific event for three years now. [pause] Is everything okay at home, or is there something I should know about?

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Everything's fine, actually, I've just been thinking about what all of this means, you know? Like, I spend six hours a day training to make a horse jump over some wooden poles, and for what exactly?

Character 1 [en]: [confused] For what?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah, for what. We're all just, I mean, we're organisms on a rock flying through space, and in a hundred years nobody's going to remember who won some regional championship in 2024. [sighs] The horses don't care about ribbons, they just want to eat grass.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Emma, this isn't like you at all, and I'm, er, worried because last week you were talking about Olympic trials and now suddenly nothing matters? What happened between then and now?

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] I read some philosophy books, started actually thinking about why I do things instead of just doing them because that's what I've always done. Turns out there's no real reason for any of it, just habits and, um, social constructs we pretend have meaning.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] You've dedicated eight years of your life to this sport, Emma, and you're one of the most naturally gifted riders I've ever trained. [exhales] Your connection with Midnight is something special, you can't just throw that away.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically] Special? It's classical conditioning and muscle memory, nothing more. The horse responds to cues for food rewards, I respond to cues for social validation, and we're both just, like, following our programming until we die.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] I've watched you grow up in these stables, taught you everything from how to hold the reins to reading a horse's emotions, and now you're telling me it was all meaningless? That hurts more than you know.

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] The hurt you're feeling is just neurons firing in patterns, chemicals released in your brain that evolution selected for because social bonding helped our ancestors survive. [pause] It's not actually meaningful, it just feels like it is.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] God, Emma, listen to yourself! You sound like you've given up on everything that makes life worth living, all the joy and connection and, honestly, the beauty of what we do here every single day.

Character 2 [en]: Beauty is subjective.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] So is nihilism!

Character 2 [en]: Maybe, but at least nihilism doesn't require me to wake up at five AM to shovel horse manure while pretending it's building character or teaching me life lessons or whatever story we tell ourselves.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Fine, if you've really thought this through and you're certain, then I won't try to change your mind anymore. But, um, can you at least tell Midnight goodbye properly? He deserves that much.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] The horse doesn't understand goodbye, but yeah, I'll go see him one more time, mostly because, I mean, even if caring is meaningless, I still feel it. [sighs] That's the stupid paradox of knowing nothing matters.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Maybe feeling it is enough.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] You know what's funny? You're still trying to find meaning even in my meaninglessness. [chuckles] That's very you, coach, and I guess if I believed in anything, er, I'd admire that stubborn optimism.

Character 1 [en]: [sadly] I'll miss you, Emma.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Yeah, I know you will, and weirdly enough, I'll probably miss this place too, even though missing things is just another evolutionary trick our brains play on us. [trailing off] But knowing that doesn't make the feeling go away, does it?
