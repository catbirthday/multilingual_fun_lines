Scenario: A Gen X music store owner discovers their estranged sibling, now a successful corporate executive, browsing vinyl records in their shop after fifteen years of no contact.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] That's a first pressing of London Calling you're holding, worth about three hundred dollars if you're actually planning to buy it. [pause] Or are you just here to browse like you always did, touching everything and leaving without a word?

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] I heard you'd opened this place after Dad's funeral, thought maybe I'd check it out while I was in town for a conference. [quietly] Didn't expect you'd actually be working the counter on a random Tuesday afternoon.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Well, some of us actually have to work for a living instead of flying around giving PowerPoint presentations about synergy or whatever corporate garbage you peddle now. [laughs] Fifteen years and you show up holding The Clash like nothing happened.

Character 2 [en]: [angrily] You think I wanted this silence between us? [louder] You're the one who told me never to come back after Mom got sick, said I'd chosen my career over family and didn't deserve to be there.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] She asked for you every single day those last three months, kept thinking you'd walk through that hospital door with your stupid briefcase and fancy suit. [sighs] But you were closing deals in Singapore or Tokyo or wherever mattered more.

Character 2 [en]: I was trying to pay for her treatment! Someone had to cover what insurance wouldn't, and it sure wasn't coming from your band's bar gigs or Dad's disability checks.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Money, always about the money with you! [loudly] We needed you there, not your credit card, not your medical specialist recommendations from three time zones away, just you sitting next to her bed.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I sent those specialists because I couldn't face watching her fade away like that. [trembling] Every time I tried to book a flight home, I'd remember how she looked at Christmas, twenty pounds lighter, and I just—I couldn't.

Character 1 [en]: [barely audible] Coward.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, maybe I am a coward, but at least I'm here now trying to fix this mess between us instead of hiding behind vintage albums and pretending the past doesn't exist.

Character 1 [en]: You want to fix this? [sarcastically] Great, let's just pretend fifteen years didn't happen, that Mom didn't die thinking her youngest hated her, that Dad didn't drink himself to death afterwards wondering where he went wrong.

Character 2 [en]: [pause] He drank himself to death?

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] The death certificate said liver failure but we both know what that really means when it happens eighteen months after losing your wife of forty years. [sighs] He kept your childhood bedroom exactly the same, like you might walk in any minute.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I wrote him letters, dozens of them, trying to explain why I stayed away, why seeing him without Mom would break something in me that couldn't be fixed. Never sent a single one.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] There's a box of unsent letters in the stockroom addressed to you, stuff I wrote when I was drunk or angry or just needed to scream at someone who wasn't there. [chuckles] Guess we're both idiots.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The store looks good, really good actually, like that record shop on Haight Street we used to dream about owning when we were kids listening to Dad's collection. You even have the same milk crates we stole from behind the grocery store.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Still have your initials carved into that one by the jazz section, kept meaning to sand it off but never quite got around to it. [pause] The Clash album's yours if you want it, consider it fifteen years of missed birthday presents.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] I have a flight in three hours but maybe I could change it, stick around for a day or two if you'd be willing to grab dinner or something. [quickly] Only if you want to, I mean, I'd understand if this is too much too fast.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Cancel the flight. [sighs] We've got fifteen years of silence to unpack and one dinner isn't going to cut it, besides, someone needs to help me sort through Dad's collection in the basement that I haven't been able to face alone.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Yeah, okay, I'll cancel it right now. [laughs] Remember when he caught us playing his original pressing of Pet Sounds and grounded us both for a month? Some things never change, I guess.
