=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [shaky voice] आज मैंने सब कुछ खो दिया, literally everything gone in about forty-five minutes जब copper market गिर गया। [bitter] सात साल लगाए थे उस portfolio को बनाने में, सब खत्म हो गया because I didn't hedge properly against the Chilean mine strikes.

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] अरे अंदर आओ, तुम तो ऐसे लग रहे हो जैसे कई दिनों से कुछ खाया ही नहीं। [concerned] जब तुमने फोन किया था कि किसी से बात करनी है जो loss को समझता हो, मुझे नहीं पता था कि इतना बुरा हाल है।

Character 1 [mix]: [frantically] Margin calls सुबह साढ़े नौ बजे शुरू हुईं, and by noon they'd liquidated my entire position. [voice breaking] मैं firm को 2.3 million का कर्जदार हूं जो मेरे पास है ही नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [calmly] बैठो, मैं तुम्हारे लिए चाय बनाता हूं। [gently] मैं जानता हूं कि ये सब कुछ का अंत लग रहा होगा, लेकिन तुम अभी भी सांस ले रहे हो, यहां हो, and that matters more than you realize right now.

Character 1 [mix]: [confused] तुम इतने शांत कैसे हो? तुमने अपनी law practice खोई, शादी टूटी, सब कुछ गया जब तुम पी रहे थे, and now I show up here basically bankrupt और तुम चाय बना रहे हो?

Character 2 [mix]: [sincerely] क्योंकि मैंने rehab में कुछ सीखा जो मुझे समझने में 38 साल लग गए। [pause] जो चीज़ें हम सोचते हैं कि हमारी पहचान हैं, पैसा, करियर, status, they're just stories we tell ourselves about who we are.

Character 1 [mix]: ये कहना आसान है जब तुम lawsuits और bankruptcy proceedings का सामना नहीं कर रहे।

Character 2 [mix]: [empathetically] असल में, मैंने दोनों का सामना किया है, याद है? [quietly] मेरा license चला गया, तीन DUI हुईं, और मेरी ex-wife को divorce में सब कुछ मिला including the house we're sitting in right now जो मैं अब उससे rent पर लेता हूं।

Character 1 [mix]: [desperately] लेकिन trading ही तो मैं जानता हूं, यही मेरी पहचान है! [exhales] मैं पंद्रह साल की उम्र से markets देख रहा हूं, बाईस में Series 7 मिली, मैंने अपनी पूरी identity इसी पर बनाई कि मैं commodity flows को किसी से भी बेहतर समझ सकता हूं।

Character 2 [mix]: [supportively] और मैंने अपनी बनाई थी इस पर कि मैं वो lawyer हूं जो कभी case नहीं हारता, until I lost myself in a bottle. [chuckles] अब मैं community center में pottery सिखाता हूं, और somehow मैं उससे ज्यादा खुश हूं जब मैं 800 डॉलर प्रति घंटे bill करता था।

Character 1 [mix]: [anxiously] मेरे पापा को कल Bloomberg पर पता चल जाएगा। [mumbling] उन्होंने अपने connections लगाए थे मुझे उस firm में लाने के लिए, country club में सबको बताया था कि उनका बेटा next trading genius है।

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] तुम्हारे पापा की राय तुम्हारे बारे में मरने लायक नहीं है, और मैं तुम्हारी आंखों में देख सकता हूं कि तुम्हारा दिमाग वहीं जा रहा है। [very quietly] मैं भी वहां था, तेरह महीने पहले kitchen counter पर गोलियां गिनी थीं।

Character 1 [mix]: [crying while speaking] मैं कुछ और बनना नहीं जानता। [sighs] Trading floor का adrenaline नहीं, जीत हार कुछ नहीं, I don't know who I am anymore.

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] बस यहीं से recovery शुरू होती है, इस न जानने की जगह से। [confidently] जब मैंने खुद को define करना बंद किया कि मैं क्या करता हूं, और ये explore करना शुरू किया कि actually मैं कौन हूं उस सारे performance के नीचे, that's when life got real.

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] तुम सच में मानते हो कि कोई कुछ नहीं से rebuild कर सकता है? क्योंकि अभी मेरे पास यही है, actually कुछ नहीं से भी कम, I'm in a massive hole that keeps getting deeper with interest.

Character 2 [mix]: [passionately] मैं जीता जागता सबूत हूं कि कर सकते हैं। [speaking fast] Bankruptcy एक legal process है, death sentence नहीं, और ऐसे lawyers हैं जो payment plans पर काम करेंगे, I can give you names tomorrow.

Character 1 [mix]: [exhausted] मैं तीन दिन से सोया नहीं हूं, बस charts घूरता रहा trying to figure out where I went wrong. [quietly] वो moment बार बार replay करता हूं जब मैंने losses cut करने के बजाय double down किया।

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] Guest room तैयार है, और कल हम मेरी AA meeting जाएंगे अगर तुम चाहो। [reassuringly] इसलिए नहीं कि तुम्हें drinking problem है, but because you'll meet twenty people who lost everything और दूसरी तरफ कुछ बेहतर पाया।

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] तुम सच में मुझे यहां रहने दोगे जबकि मैंने basically तुम्हें दो साल ignore किया जब तुम sober हो रहे थे? [regretfully] मैं अपने portfolios में इतना busy था कि rehab में मिलने भी नहीं आया।

Character 2 [mix]: [accepting] दोस्त यही करते हैं, they show up when it matters most. [sincerely] वैसे भी, तुम मेरी पुरानी life से अकेले इंसान हो जिसने मुझे completely write off नहीं किया, भले ही busy थे, you still answered when I called.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [shaky voice] I lost everything today, literally everything in about forty-five minutes when the copper market tanked. [bitter] Seven years of building that portfolio, gone because I didn't hedge properly against the Chilean mine strikes.

Character 2: [warmly] Hey, come in, you look like you haven't eaten in days. [concerned] When you called saying you needed to talk to someone who understood loss, I didn't realize it was this bad.

Character 1: [frantically] The margin calls started at nine-thirty this morning and by noon they'd liquidated my entire position. [voice breaking] I owe the firm two point three million that I don't have.

Character 2: [calmly] Sit down, let me make you some tea. [gently] I know this feels like the end of everything, but you're still breathing, still here, and that matters more than you realize right now.

Character 1: [confused] How are you so calm? You lost your law practice, your marriage, everything when you were drinking, and now I show up here basically bankrupt and you're making tea?

Character 2: [sincerely] Because I learned something in rehab that took me thirty-eight years to understand. [pause] The things we think define us, money, career, status, they're just stories we tell ourselves about who we are.

Character 1: That's easy to say when you're not facing lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings.

Character 2: [empathetically] Actually, I faced both, remember? [quietly] Lost my license to practice, had three DUIs, and my ex-wife got everything in the divorce including the house we're sitting in right now that I rent from her.

Character 1: [desperately] But trading is all I know, it's who I am! [exhales] I've been watching markets since I was fifteen, got my Series 7 at twenty-two, built my whole identity around being the guy who could read commodity flows better than anyone.

Character 2: [supportively] And I built mine around being the lawyer who never lost a case, until I lost myself in a bottle. [chuckles] Now I teach pottery at the community center and somehow I'm happier than I ever was billing eight hundred an hour.

Character 1: [anxiously] My dad is going to find out about this on Bloomberg tomorrow. [mumbling] He pulled strings to get me into that firm, told everyone at the country club his son was the next trading genius.

Character 2: [firmly] Your dad's opinion of you isn't worth dying for, and I can see in your eyes that's where your head is going. [very quietly] I've been there, had the pills counted out on my kitchen counter thirteen months ago.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] I don't know how to be anything else. [sighs] Without the adrenaline of the trading floor, without the wins and even the losses, I don't know who I am anymore.

Character 2: [warmly] That's exactly where recovery begins, in that space of not knowing. [confidently] When I stopped defining myself by what I did and started exploring who I actually was underneath all that performance, that's when life got real.

Character 1: [hesitantly] You really think someone can rebuild from nothing? Because that's what I have now, less than nothing actually, I'm in a massive hole that keeps getting deeper with interest.

Character 2: [passionately] I'm living proof that you can. [speaking fast] Bankruptcy is a legal process, not a death sentence, and there are lawyers who'll work with you on payment plans, I can give you names tomorrow.

Character 1: [exhausted] I haven't slept in three days, just staring at charts trying to figure out where I went wrong. [quietly] Keep replaying that moment when I doubled down instead of cutting losses.

Character 2: [gently] The guest room is made up, and tomorrow we'll go to my AA meeting if you want. [reassuringly] Not because you have a drinking problem, but because you'll meet twenty people who lost everything and found something better on the other side.

Character 1: [surprised] You'd really let me stay here after I basically ignored you for two years while you were getting sober? [regretfully] I was too busy with my portfolios to even visit you in rehab.

Character 2: [accepting] That's what friends do, they show up when it matters most. [sincerely] Besides, you're the only person from my old life who didn't completely write me off, even if you were busy, you still answered when I called.
