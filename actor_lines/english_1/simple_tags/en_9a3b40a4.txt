Scenario: A union steward seeks emergency treatment from their ex-spouse, a massage therapist, after injuring their back during a heated labor dispute at the factory picket line.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [bitter] I wouldn't be here if I had, [frustrated], any other option but my back is completely seized up from the police shoving.

Character 2: [stern] Well, um, you always did put your union battles, [angry], before everything else, even, like, your own health and, [coldly], the people who actually cared about you, you know.

Character 1: [defensive] Fighting for workers' rights isn't something I can just, [shaky voice], turn off when it's inconvenient, and you knew that when we, [regretful], got married all those years ago.

Character 2: Um, take your shirt off and, [hesitantly], lie face down on the table, I mean. [sigh]

Character 1: [quietly] Thank you.

Character 2: [mocking] Don't thank me yet because this is going to, [loudly], hurt like hell given how badly you've damaged these muscles.

Character 1: [anxious] Look, um, I know coming here was, [uncomfortable], complicated but the factory owners are trying to, like, break us and I can't, [desperately], miss tomorrow's negotiations, you know.

Character 2: Your L4 and L5 vertebrae are completely, [shocked], misaligned and these muscle knots feel like, [disgusted], concrete under your skin.

Character 1: Well, um, the scabs they brought in, [furious], crossed our picket line this morning and things got, [trembling], physical when they started recording our faces for the blacklist, I mean. [groan]

Character 2: [apologetic] Um, I heard about the violence on the news but, [worried], I didn't know you were, like, caught in the middle of it, you know.

Character 1: [exhausted] Well, thirty years of organizing and, um, this might be the fight that finally, [slowly], breaks me because, like, my body can't take this anymore.

Character 2: You need at least, um, three weeks of rest and, [empathetically], regular treatment or you'll cause permanent damage, I mean. [pause]

Character 1: Um, three weeks would mean the contract negotiations, [hoarsely], fail and eight hundred families lose their healthcare, you know. [cough]

Character 2: [warm] I still have your insurance card from when we were together so I'll, [softly], bill this as emergency treatment.

Character 1: [surprised] You kept it?

Character 2: [embarrassed] The divorce papers are signed but apparently I'm still, [sadly], terrible at letting go of things that, [whispering], matter to me even when they hurt.

Character 1: Maybe after this contract fight ends we could, [hopefully], talk about what went wrong between us.

Character 2: [bitterly] We both know you'll just find another battle to fight because that's, [resigned], who you are and who you'll always be.

Character 1: [very quietly] Well, um, maybe this time I'm finally ready to, [sincerely], choose differently, you know.

Character 2: [skeptical] Um, I've heard that before but, [gently], for now let's just focus on fixing your back, I mean. [long pause]
