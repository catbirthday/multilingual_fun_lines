Scenario: A European baron whose shipping company is under investigation confronts the DEA agent who has been tracking his cargo vessels for years at an embassy gala.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [formal] Agent Morrison, I believe? Your reputation precedes you at these embassy functions, though I'm surprised they'd invite someone who spends their days chasing ghosts through shipping manifests.

Character 2: [calmly] Baron Reichert, the ghosts in your shipping manifests have names, addresses, and body counts. [pause] Three of your vessels made unscheduled stops in international waters last month, each time exactly twelve miles from Colombian territorial limits.

Character 1: [dismissive] Mechanical difficulties happen.

Character 2: [skeptical] Mechanical difficulties that resolve themselves in precisely four hours, require no parts or repairs, and happen only when specific containers are on board? [quietly] We've been tracking your fleet for three years now.

Character 1: [irritated] My family has operated shipping lines since before your country existed, Agent Morrison. [clears throat] We've survived two world wars, countless economic crashes, and yes, the occasional overzealous investigator who sees conspiracies in routine maritime operations.

Character 2: [firmly] The Castellano family said something similar before we seized fourteen tons of cocaine from containers registered to your subsidiary in Hamburg. [slowly] Your signature was on those shipping documents, Baron.

Character 1: [caught-off-guard] Those containers were sub-leased through intermediaries, I sign hundreds of documents weekly without knowing every detail of cargo that moves through our networks. [exhales] Surely you understand how modern logistics operate.

Character 2: [intentionally] I understand that your chief financial officer fled to Switzerland last week, two days after we subpoenaed your company's records. [pause] That's not the behavior of an innocent shipping magnate dealing with routine investigations.

Character 1: [defensive] Heinrich left for a scheduled medical procedure that's been planned for months, his prostate cancer requires specialized treatment only available in Zurich. [frustrated] You're constructing narratives from coincidences.

Character 2: [coldly] Coincidences like your nephew's arrest in Miami with two kilos of pure Colombian cocaine that matched the chemical signature of product we've been tracking through your supply chain? He had your business card in his wallet.

Character 1: [quietly] My nephew is troubled, has been since his father died, and I've tried to help him despite his problems. [sighs] Giving him my business card doesn't make me responsible for his criminal activities.

Character 2: [pressing] But funding his lifestyle through shell companies in the Caymans does make you an accessory. [deliberately] We have the bank records, Baron, including the wire transfers you authorized three days before each of his deals.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Those were loans for his rehabilitation, for legitimate medical expenses related to his addiction treatment programs. [pause] Every payment has documentation showing its intended purpose.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Rehabilitation centers that don't exist, doctors who've never heard of him, and treatment facilities that are actually nightclubs in South Beach? [laughs] Your lawyers coached you better than this, surely.

Character 1: [bitter] You've already decided I'm guilty, haven't you? Three years of investigation and you need someone to blame for your department's failure to stop the real traffickers who use legitimate businesses as cover.

Character 2: [very quietly] The real traffickers don't have your Habsburg ring on their finger or their grandfather's portrait hanging in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. [pause] But they do have your private phone number.

Character 1: [exhales] Prove it.

Character 2: [confidently] Tomorrow morning, 9 AM, federal courthouse. [slowly] We're unsealing the indictment with forty-seven counts including racketeering, money laundering, and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances across international borders.

Character 1: [resigned] Then I suppose this is our last civilized conversation, Agent Morrison. [formally] My attorneys will handle all further communications, as I'm sure you'd expect from someone of my supposed criminal sophistication.

Character 2: [warmly] You know, Baron, three years ago I thought you were just another rich man who looked the other way. [sighs] Now I know you're the architect of the whole operation, and that's almost impressive if it weren't so destructive.
