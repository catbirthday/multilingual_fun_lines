Scenario: An evil stepmother visits a prosthetics artist to get a replacement finger, unaware that the artist has been working with her stepdaughter to uncover the truth about a violent incident from their childhood.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [coldly] I need a prosthetic index finger, left hand, and I understand you're the best in the city for realistic work. [pause] Money isn't an issue, but discretion is absolutely essential.

Character 2: [professionally] Of course, I work with many clients who value privacy, especially those with visible differences they prefer to keep personal. [clears throat] May I ask how you lost the finger?

Character 1: [sharply] An accident.

Character 2: [carefully] I see.

Character 1: The scarring is extensive, as you can see, and I need something that will look completely natural, something that won't draw any unwanted attention or questions from people. [quietly] Particularly from family.

Character 2: [curious] Family can be complicated about these things, can't they? [pause] Sometimes the people closest to us have the hardest time accepting changes, even ones that help us heal.

Character 1: [bitter] My stepdaughter wouldn't understand, she was too young when it happened, and her father prefers we don't discuss that particular evening. [sighs] Some stories are better left buried.

Character 2: [gently] I've been doing this for fifteen years, and every scar tells a story, but not all stories need to be shared. [hesitantly] Though sometimes the body remembers what we try to forget.

Character 1: [defensively] I remember everything perfectly clearly, the kitchen knife slipping while I was preparing dinner, the blood everywhere, my stepdaughter screaming from her highchair. [exhales] Children have such vivid imaginations about these things.

Character 2: [slowly] Interesting that you mention a kitchen knife, because these scars look more like defensive wounds, the kind I usually see when someone's protecting themselves. [firmly] The angle is all wrong for a cooking accident.

Character 1: [angrily] I didn't come here for your amateur forensic analysis, I came for a prosthetic finger! [loudly] Are you going to help me or should I find someone else who understands professional boundaries?

Character 2: [calmly] I'll help you, but I need to document everything properly for insurance purposes, including photographs of the injury site. [pause] It's standard procedure, especially for traumatic amputations.

Character 1: [frustrated] Fine, take your photographs, but I want them destroyed after the prosthetic is complete, and nothing goes into any permanent medical records. [threateningly] I have lawyers who are very particular about privacy violations.

Character 2: [quietly] You know, I worked with a young woman last year who had similar scarring on her arms, defensive wounds from childhood. [carefully] She mentioned something about protecting her baby sister from their stepmother's rages.

Character 1: [very quietly] That's impossible, she was only four years old when it happened, she couldn't possibly remember anything clearly enough to matter. [shaky voice] Children misremember things all the time.

Character 2: Her name was Lily, said her sister was Emma, and she'd been searching for years to find out what really happened that night in the kitchen. [warmly] She remembered more than you'd think.

Character 1: [whispering] Lily's dead, she died in a car accident five years ago, so whoever you met was lying to you. [gasps] This conversation is over.

Character 2: [softly] Lily's very much alive, Mrs. Patterson, and she's actually in my waiting room right now, hoping to finally confront you after all these years. [pause] She recognized your name in my appointment book.

Character 1: [panicking] You set me up, this whole thing was a trap! [furiously] You have no idea what that girl put our family through with her lies and accusations!

Character 2: [firmly] The only trap here is the one you've been running from for twenty years, and maybe it's time to stop running. [sighs] Lily deserves the truth about why her sister Emma really can't speak anymore.
