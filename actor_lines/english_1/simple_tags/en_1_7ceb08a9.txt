=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [firmly] I've dismantled Fortune 500 companies, orchestrated hostile takeovers worth billions, and you're telling me there's nothing I can do to move my daughter up this list? [frustrated] There has to be a system, a protocol, something we can work with here.

Character 2: [empathetically] The allocation system is designed specifically to prevent any influence, financial or otherwise, from affecting organ distribution. [quietly] Your daughter's MELD score is twenty-two, which places her where she is based purely on medical criteria, not on who her father is.

Character 1: [angry] Don't lecture me about fairness when my sixteen-year-old is dying. [pause] I've spent my entire career finding loopholes in systems that people said were airtight, and you're telling me this one is different?

Character 2: [calmly] This one is different because it's built on medical urgency and tissue compatibility, not market forces. [sighs] Every name on this list represents someone's child, someone's parent, someone who matters just as much as your daughter does.

Character 1: [quickly] What if I fund an entire wing of this hospital? What if I establish a research foundation? [desperately] There must be private options, international alternatives, something outside this bureaucratic nightmare you're describing.

Character 2: [gently] International options exist, but they come with significant medical risks and ethical concerns about organ trafficking. [slowly] Your daughter needs a pediatric heart with specific tissue markers, and traveling in her condition could be fatal.

Character 1: [bitter] So I'm supposed to just sit here and wait while my daughter gets sicker? [loudly] While some committee decides whether she deserves to live based on numbers on a chart?

Character 2: [steadily] No committee decides who deserves to live. [pause] The system ensures organs go to those who need them most urgently and can benefit most from transplantation, and your daughter is absolutely in that category.

Character 1: [shaky voice] She asked me yesterday if she was going to die. [very quietly] I've never not had an answer before, never not had a plan.

Character 2: [warmly] Not having control doesn't mean not having hope. [softly] In my fifteen years doing this job, I've seen outcomes that defy every prediction, matches that come when families have almost given up.

Character 1: [hesitantly] How do other parents handle this waiting? [clears throat] The ones who can't buy their way out of problems, who've been dealing with this their whole lives?

Character 2: [thoughtfully] They lean on each other, form support groups, find strength in shared experiences. [gently] Some of the strongest people I've ever met are in our family waiting room right now, and they'd welcome you if you let them.

Character 1: [quietly] I've made enemies of entire industries, destroyed people's livelihoods without losing sleep. [pause] But I can't fight this, can I?

Character 2: [sincerely] You can't fight the system, but you can fight for your daughter in other ways. [encouragingly] Being present, keeping her spirits up, preparing for when that call comes, because it will come.

Character 1: [curiously] What are the real odds here? [firmly] Not the sanitized version you give families, but the actual statistical probability based on her markers and position?

Character 2: Based on her blood type, antibody profile, and current list position, she has roughly a sixty-five percent chance of receiving a match within the next three months. [honestly] Those odds improve slightly each week she remains stable.

Character 1: [vulnerably] I keep thinking about all the companies I've stripped for parts, all the jobs I've eliminated to increase shareholder value. [sighs] Now my daughter needs a part, and karma doesn't accept leveraged buyouts as payment.

Character 2: [compassionately] Whatever you've done in boardrooms has nothing to do with your daughter's medical situation. [firmly] But who you choose to be in this room, for her, during this time, that matters more than any deal you've ever made.

Character 1: [resolved] Tell me about these support groups, about what I should expect in the coming weeks. [steadily] If I can't control this situation, at least I can be prepared for it.

Character 2: [supportively] There's a meeting tomorrow at four, just down the hall, and I'll introduce you personally to some of the families. [warmly] Your daughter is lucky to have a father willing to face this fear, even if it goes against every instinct you've developed in your career.
