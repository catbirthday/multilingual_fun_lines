Scenario: An arborist arrives to remove a dying tree that has been the center of a small cult's worship site for decades, confronting their most devoted follower who refuses to leave.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [professional] Look, um, I understand this tree means something to you but, [firm], the root rot has spread so far that, well, it could fall at any moment, you know.

Character 2: [trembling] Please don't. [sniffle]

Character 1: [empathetically] The city condemned it after the storm damage and, [frustrated], I've been contracted to remove it before someone gets, [concerned], hurt when those branches finally give way.

Character 2: [desperate] I mean, we've been coming here for fifteen years, um, gathering under these branches every week to, [crying while speaking], share our devotion and, well, you can't just destroy our sacred space. [sob]

Character 1: [hesitantly] Sacred or not, the heartwood is completely, [anxious], hollowed out by fungus and those cracks in the trunk are, [slowly], getting wider every single day. [pause]

Character 2: [needy] If you just gave us more time, [pleading], we could perform the final ceremonies before it falls naturally.

Character 1: [stern] Natural falling means potentially crushing that playground or, [worried], worse, landing on one of your followers during your, [bitter], ceremonies. [groan]

Character 2: [compliant] Um, I know you're right but, [shaky voice], this tree chose us, spoke to us through, [whispering], its leaves and we can't, well, abandon it now, you know.

Character 1: [confused] Trees don't speak to people, [impatient], they're biological organisms that follow predictable patterns of, [analytical], growth and decay based on environmental factors, not spiritual, [trailing off], connections or whatever you think is happening here.

Character 2: [defensive] You spend your whole life studying trees but, [passionately], you've never actually listened to one, never felt the, [very quietly], energy pulsing through ancient bark.

Character 1: [exhausted] I've been an arborist for twenty years and I've seen, [regretful], dozens of groups like yours who anthropomorphize dying trees rather than, [sadly], accepting the natural cycle of life and death. [sigh]

Character 2: The others are already gathering for tonight's vigil and, [frantic], they won't let you cut it down, not while we're, [loudly], still breathing. [laugh nervously]

Character 1: [warm] Your devotion is touching but misplaced because this tree, [gently], is already dead inside, has been for months, and keeping it standing is, [very sad], just prolonging everyone's grief including yours.

Character 2: Well, um, maybe so. [cry]

Character 1: [relieved] Um, wait, are you actually, well, willing to let go? [gasp softly]

Character 2: [monotone] After fifteen years of believing, [defeated], everything is just dying anyway.

Character 1: [hopeful] We could save some branches for your group, [thoughtful], create memorial pieces from the wood. [chuckle]

Character 2: I mean, the truth is, um, I've felt it dying for months but, [broken], couldn't admit it to the others, you know.

Character 1: [sincerely] Sometimes the most sacred thing we can do is, [kindly], help something die with dignity before it, [whispering loudly], causes harm to what surrounds it, before it, [very melancholic], takes others down with its fall.

Character 2: [resigned] Um, I'll gather them now and, [tearful], tell them it's time to say goodbye, I mean, properly this time.
