Scenario: A jailer escorts a technical director to visit their incarcerated brother who was the lighting designer for the theater's most acclaimed production before his arrest.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [gently] Well, um, I know this isn't easy for you to be here but, [warm], your brother's been asking about the theater production and, [empathetically], I thought maybe you could tell him how it went, you know. [pause]

Character 2: [hesitantly] The opening night was everything he designed it to be with the, [shaky voice], lighting cues hitting perfectly even though we had to, [quietly], adjust everything after his arrest. [sigh]

Character 1: [caring] He still talks about the way he programmed those sunset transitions for Act Two and, [proudly], how you two worked together on the technical aspects until, [very quietly], everything fell apart that night.

Character 2: I brought the reviews and photos because I thought, [emotionally], seeing the standing ovations might give him something to hold onto.

Character 1: [reassuring] That's exactly the kind of thing that helps them remember who they were before, [thoughtfully], all this happened and who they can, [hopefully], still be when they get out.

Character 2: [anxious] The crew still asks about him every day because they can't believe their, [frustrated], brilliant lighting designer is sitting in a cell instead of, [bitter], working on our next production which opens in three weeks.

Character 1: [sympathetically] I've seen a lot of talented people come through here but your brother's different because he, [sincerely], genuinely wants to make amends and he's been, [respectfully], teaching lighting basics to other inmates.

Character 2: He was always the one who could find light in darkness which is, [melancholic], ironic given where he is now.

Character 1: [softly] Um, well, I mean, he's lucky though.

Character 2: Most people here don't have anyone visiting them but you've come every week without fail which, [appreciatively], means more than you probably realize.

Character 1: [friendly] I've watched him transform from that angry man who arrived six months ago to someone who's, [optimistically], actually helping others and that's partly because you never, [gratefully], gave up on him. [chuckle]

Character 2: [tearfully] The theater board wants to know if he'll be able to work again when he gets out because his, [hopefully], parole hearing is coming up soon.

Character 1: [confidently] Between his good behavior and the vocational training he's completed here plus your testimony about, [encouragingly], the job waiting for him and the support system in place, [firmly], I think the parole board will see he deserves another chance.

Character 2: [relieved] That means everything because the whole technical crew signed a petition saying they want him, [passionately], back on the lighting board. [laugh]

Character 1: You know what's funny is that in twenty years of doing this job I've rarely seen, [moved], such loyalty from someone's professional community or such, [touched], dedication from a sibling. [gasp softly]

Character 2: [determined] We're a theater family which means we believe in second acts and transformation and the, [inspired], power of redemption stories even when they happen offstage.

Character 1: [whispering] He's ready now.

Character 2: [nervously] Well, um, before we go in I just wanted to say, like, [genuinely], thank you for treating him like a human being and not just, you know, [gratefully], another inmate because that's made all the difference, I mean. [cry]

Character 1: Everyone deserves dignity and respect especially when they're trying to rebuild and your brother has shown, [respectfully], more growth than most which gives me, [hopefully], real hope for his future. [smile]

Character 2: [trembling] Um, well, okay then, er, let's go see him.
