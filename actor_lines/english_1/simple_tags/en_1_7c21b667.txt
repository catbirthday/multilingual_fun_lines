=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [firmly] My lady, though I know not these strange streets of glass and stone, I pledge my sword to finding your child. [pause] In my time, no knight would rest while innocence wandered in darkness.

Character 2: Your time? Look, I don't care if you're from a Renaissance fair or whatever—my daughter's been gone for three hours and the police said they can't do anything until it's been twenty-four. [voice breaking] She's only eight.

Character 1: [empathetically] Eight summers old, alone in this labyrinth of towers. [very sincerely] I understand your terror, for I once failed to protect my own sister when raiders came to our village.

Character 2: [frustrated] I should have picked her up from school myself, but the shift manager threatened to fire me if I left early again. [sighs] Now she's out there somewhere because I chose a minimum wage job over being there.

Character 1: [warmly] You battle dragons of a different sort, providing sustenance and shelter alone. [confidently] Tell me, where would a frightened child seek refuge in your realm?

Character 2: [quickly] The playground, maybe the library—she loves the library. [pause] But they're closed now, and she knows not to go anywhere with strangers, so she might be hiding somewhere, too scared to come out.

Character 1: [passionately] Then we shall search every shadow and alcove until she is found! [clearing throat] My armor may draw unwanted attention, but these keen eyes have tracked deer through darker forests than your streets.

Character 2: [hesitantly] You're really going to help me? [quietly] Everyone else just said to wait, file a report, that she probably just wandered off and kids do this all the time.

Character 1: [very sincerely] In my oath as a knight, I swore to protect those who cannot protect themselves. [firmly] Your daughter needs a champion this night, and I shall be that shield against whatever darkness threatens her.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I keep thinking about all the horrible things that could happen—the news stories you hear about. [shaky voice] She's so small, and she still sleeps with her stuffed rabbit because she's afraid of the dark.

Character 1: [gently] Fear serves no purpose now save to cloud your judgment, my lady. [reassuringly] I have seen battle-hardened men flee from shadows, yet children often possess courage we underestimate.

Character 2: [anxious] What if someone took her? [speeding up] There was this van I saw circling the school last week, and I should have reported it but I thought I was being paranoid.

Character 1: [sternly] We waste precious moonlight with such dark musings. [confidently] Gather her favored toy and a garment bearing her scent—if your hounds cannot track, perhaps the mongrels of the alleys might aid us.

Character 2: [confused] You want to use dogs to track her? [pause] Actually, that's not the craziest idea—Mrs. Chen's beagle always barks whenever Emma walks by, like they're best friends.

Character 1: [animated] Excellent! [enthusiastically] Creatures oft sense what we cannot, and a child's pure heart draws loyalty from beasts. We shall marshal all allies in this quest, be they man or animal.

Character 2: [relieved] You really believe we'll find her, don't you? [quietly] I haven't felt hope since I realized her backpack was still here but she wasn't.

Character 1: Hope is the sword that cuts through despair's web, and I have witnessed miracles born from determination. [very loudly] We ride—er, walk forth now!

Character 2: [quickly] Wait, I'm grabbing her jacket and her rabbit. [exhales] And thank you for not treating me like I'm just another hysterical parent—you're actually doing something.

Character 1: [warmly] Every parent who fights for their child's safety deserves a sword at their side. [chuckles] Though I confess, your metal steeds with wheels move faster than any destrier I've ridden.

Character 2: [softly] She's going to think you're amazing when we find her—she loves fairy tales about knights and dragons. [sighs] Let's go bring my princess home.
