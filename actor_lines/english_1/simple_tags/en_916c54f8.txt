Scenario: A mining engineer visits a retirement plan consultant after a cave-in nearly killed them, forcing them to confront their mortality and the declining mining industry they've ignored.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Three weeks ago I was buried under, [shaky voice], two tons of rock for six hours thinking about all the things I never, [slowly], planned for or even considered.

Character 2: [professional] I've seen this before with clients in, [empathetically], high-risk professions who suddenly realize they've been living as if they're, [pause], invincible. [sigh]

Character 1: [bitter] The ironic thing is I calculate risk assessments for, [frustrated], tunnel stability every single day. [laugh]

Character 2: [warm] Yet somehow personal financial planning feels more abstract than, [gently], calculating rock pressure and support beam loads.

Character 1: Well, um, I mean, I've been so focused on, [anxious], the immediate work that I never thought about what happens when the, [trailing off], when the industry keeps shrinking like, you know, like it has been.

Character 2: Mining operations have been, [concerned], closing across the region for the past five years. [long pause]

Character 1: Um, I know, it's just that, well, I kept thinking, [head-in-the-clouds], somehow I'd be different, that my expertise would, [quietly], keep me valuable no matter what, you know?

Character 2: [formal] Based on your current savings and the pension from your company which might not, [worried], even exist in ten years. [gasp softly]

Character 1: [confused] Wait, the pension might not, [shocked], exist? I thought that was the one thing I could, [very quietly], count on. [groan]

Character 2: [stern] Well, um, when companies face bankruptcy, er, pension obligations often get, [regretful], restructured or reduced, and, [mechanically], with the way your industry is trending, I mean, we need to plan for that possibility. [cough]

Character 1: [whispering] My father worked forty years in those same mines and his pension barely, [angry], covers his medication now after all the, [exhausted], restructuring they did.

Character 2: [apologetic] Um, I realize this is, well, overwhelming, but, [reassuring], we can build a retirement strategy that doesn't, [confidently], depend entirely on promises your company might not be able to keep, you know? [sniffle]

Character 1: [desperate] So, um, what exactly are we, er, talking about here in terms of, [nervously], years I need to keep working?

Character 2: If we restructure now and you can, [carefully], maintain your current salary for eight more years while the industry, [grimly], continues its decline, then diversify into consulting work, [pause], we might make this work.

Character 1: Eight more years underground with the constant, [fearful], knowledge that any day could be like that cave-in, watching younger engineers, [sadly], get laid off while equipment gets older and, [whispering loudly], safety budgets shrink.

Character 2: [sympathetic] Well, um, there are other options like, er, transitioning to above-ground consulting sooner, but, [honest], that would mean working until you're seventy instead of, [very slowly], sixty-five. [yawn]

Character 1: You know, um, I spent so many years with my, [melancholic], head in the clouds about the future, er, never realizing how quickly it all goes. [deep pitch]

Character 2: [kindly] Um, the fact that you're here now, well, after what happened, shows, [encouraging], you're ready to face reality and, [determined], that's the hardest step most people never take, you know?

Character 1: [relieved] I suppose, um, better to start now than, er, wait for another wake-up call that I might not, well, survive. [chuckle]

Character 2: [optimistic] Um, exactly, and, er, with proper planning, we can, [firmly], create security that doesn't depend on an industry that's, [realistic], already showing its age, you know? [laugh softly]
