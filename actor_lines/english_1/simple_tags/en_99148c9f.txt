Scenario: A product liability attorney meets their half-brother at their late father's cabin to discuss a wrongful death lawsuit involving a defective product their father invented.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So, um, I need to tell you something about Dad's invention that's, [hesitantly], going to be really hard for both of us, and I, well, I wanted you to hear it from me first before, [shaky voice], the news breaks tomorrow about the lawsuit I'm, [bitter], filing against his estate.

Character 2: [shocked] You're suing Dad's estate when he's been, [quietly], dead for less than three months and we haven't even, [confused], figured out what to do with this cabin yet?

Character 1: [defensive] The brake sensor he patented and sold to AutoTech Industries has a fatal, [anxious], design flaw that I discovered while reviewing documents for his estate and it's already, [trembling], killed seventeen people including a family with three, [frustrated], young children last month.

Character 2: Dad spent twenty years perfecting that sensor and always said it was, [angry], the safest thing he'd ever designed for the automotive industry.

Character 1: The safety tests he submitted were, [slowly], falsified to hide a critical failure rate that happens in cold weather conditions when the, [passionately], sensor freezes and the brakes don't engage properly which is something he, [regretful], knew about according to his personal notes. [sigh]

Character 2: Well, umm, maybe there's an explanation we don't, [upset], understand yet because, er, Dad wasn't the kind of person who would knowingly put people at risk.

Character 1: [stern] Look, um, I found emails where he literally told AutoTech about the problem but, well, they decided the fix was too expensive and he, [exhausted], agreed to stay quiet for an extra million dollars which is, you know, [disappointed], blood money. [groan]

Character 2: [whispering] That can't be true.

Character 1: [empathetically] I've spent three weeks going through every document and wishing I could find, [very quietly], another explanation but the evidence is overwhelming and as an attorney I have, [formal], a legal obligation to report this. [pause]

Character 2: So, um, you're choosing your career over protecting what's left of, [melancholic], our father's reputation and, well, destroying everything our family built together over, [crying while speaking], the past thirty years? [gasp softly]

Character 1: [warm] Well, I mean, this isn't about my career—it's about those seventeen people who died because, umm, Dad chose money over their lives and, [sincerely], the hundreds more who could die if we don't, [relieved], stop these sensors from staying on the market. [cough]

Character 2: [pleading] But, er, couldn't we handle this privately somehow, like, umm, convince AutoTech to recall the sensors without, [desperate], dragging Dad's name through the courts and making our family, [worried], the target of everyone's anger? [sniffle]

Character 1: [gently] You know, I actually tried that first but, um, AutoTech's lawyers basically laughed at me and said without, [determined], a public lawsuit they'll keep selling these defective sensors because the profit margins are, well, [coldly], too good to give up voluntarily. [laugh bitterly]

Character 2: [resigned] The trust fund Dad left us came from those sensor patents which means every, [nauseated], dollar we've been living on for the past five years is connected to those, [disgusted], deaths and I don't know how to, [broken], process that information right now.

Character 1: [compassionate] Um, I've already decided to donate my entire inheritance to, well, the victims' families once the lawsuit is settled because keeping that money would, [firmly], make me complicit in what he did.

Character 2: [thoughtful] Well, umm, maybe you're right about this being bigger than just our family and, er, protecting Dad's legacy when, [courageously], innocent lives are at stake. [deep breath]

Character 1: [grateful] That means more to me than you know because I've been, [emotionally], terrified of losing you over this but I couldn't live with myself if more people, [tearfully], died because I stayed silent to protect our father's, [honestly], tainted reputation.

Character 2: [supportive] So, um, what do you need from me to make this right, because I guess, well, if we're going to tear down everything Dad built, [resolutely], we should at least do it together as, [lovingly], brothers?

Character 1: [hopeful] Well, I need you to testify about the conversations you had with Dad about the sensors and, um, help me go through his workshop here to find any, [carefully], additional documentation that might help the case. [exhale]

Character 2: [accepting] Then let's start tonight and find every piece of evidence that proves what, [bravely], really happened so those families can finally get justice. [nod]
