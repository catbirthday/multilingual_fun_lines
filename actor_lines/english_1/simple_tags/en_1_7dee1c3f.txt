=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] Maya? That can't be— [gasps] Jesus Christ, it is you. What the hell are you doing with these people? We used to play soccer together in your grandmother's yard.

Character 2: [bitter] These people? [loudly] These people are the only family I have left after your drones killed everyone else in the market bombing last spring. [very quietly] Including my grandmother.

Character 1: [shaky voice] That wasn't me, Maya. I fly surveillance missions, reconnaissance only. [defensively] I track movements, I don't drop bombs, I would never—

Character 2: [furious] You think that makes you innocent? [shouting] Your intel tells them where to strike! Every coordinate you send back is a death sentence for someone's family!

Character 1: [quietly] You think I don't know that? [pause] I see their faces through the cameras sometimes, the people going about their lives, and I have to tag them as targets or non-targets like they're just data points.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Must be so hard for you.

Character 1: You joined them, Maya. The rebels. [sighs] After everything we promised each other about staying out of this war, you picked up a rifle and became exactly what we swore we'd never be.

Character 2: [firmly] I didn't have a choice!

Character 1: [empathetically] There's always a choice. [very quietly] I chose the government because they threatened my sister's scholarship, said they'd revoke her visa if I didn't enlist. [trailing off] What was your reason?

Character 2: [long pause] They killed my parents.

Character 1: [whispering] Oh God, Maya, I didn't know.

Character 2: [warmly] Remember when we were kids and thought we'd open that restaurant together? [sad] You'd handle the business side and I'd cook all my grandmother's recipes, serve real food to people, not military rations.

Character 1: [melancholic] I still have that notebook where we drew the floor plans. [chuckles] You insisted on having a wood-fire oven even though neither of us knew how to build one.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Listen, my commander will be here in twenty minutes to interrogate you. [very quietly] They're going to want drone codes, base locations, everything you know about the surveillance network.

Character 1: And when I don't give them what they want? Because I won't, Maya. [firmly] I can't betray my unit any more than you could betray yours.

Character 2: [anxious] They have ways of making people talk that I don't want to see happen to you. [whispering loudly] There's a guard shift change in fifteen minutes, the south fence has a gap near the generator.

Character 1: [confused] Why are you telling me this? [pause] If they find out you helped me escape, they'll execute you for treason.

Character 2: [very sincerely] Because somewhere under all this uniform and anger, you're still that kid who shared their lunch with me every day for a year when my family couldn't afford food. [sighs] That has to count for something.

Character 1: If I run, we'll be enemies next time we meet. Real enemies. [shaky voice] I might have to mark you as a target on my screen, just another heat signature to track.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] Then we'll be enemies. [firmly] But right now, for the next ten minutes, you're just Danny and I'm just Maya, and I'm giving my friend a chance to live. [whispering] Please take it.
