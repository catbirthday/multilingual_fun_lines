            "role": "Character 2",

            "content": "It was a complete disaster at first! She cried for three days straight, my dad wouldn't even look at me, and my sister told everyone at school I'd lost my mind—but you know what? They all come to my shows now."

            "content": "Twice—once when I was nineteen and [anxious] cocky, thought I knew everything, and, err, once five years ago when the rigging failed. The first one taught me humility, the second one taught me that, well, even when you do everything right, sometimes, you know, things still go wrong."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "It took three months of, basically, therapy and another two of, you know, physical rehab before I could even look at the trapeze without shaking. But the thing is, flying is who I am—staying on the ground felt like, err, dying slowly."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Maybe I am! But I'd rather be insane and alive up there than sane and dead inside down here—does that make sense? There's something about defying gravity that makes everything else worth it."
