Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about our burn rate and, like, I don't appreciate you [laugh histerically] constantly bringing it up, honestly.

Character 2: Whoa, okay—I wasn't trying to attack you here. This is about the company's survival, not personal criticism, and we need to have these conversations whether they're comfortable or not.

Character 1: Well, actually, I think you're being [overly polite] unfair because, you know, I've been working, er, eighteen hour days here.

Character 2: Nobody's questioning your, um, work ethic—that's not what this is, basically, about at all. The reality is we're burning through, well, capital faster than anticipated, and I mean, that's just math speaking.

Character 1: Oh so, like, now you're the financial expert? I guess, um, my MBA means nothing, hmm?

Character 2: Your MBA means everything—that's, actually, why I need you to, sort of, engage with this problem instead of, you know, deflecting. We're partners here, remember? This defensiveness isn't helping us find solutions.

Character 1: I'm not being defensive! You're the one who keeps catastrophizing everything!

Character 2: Catastrophizing? We have three months of runway left—that's not catastrophizing, that's acknowledging reality. If stating facts feels like an attack to you, maybe we need to examine why that is.

Character 1: There you go again, making this about me instead of the actual problem.

Character 2: The problem is we need, err, solutions, not arguments about who's, I mean, to blame here. Can we please just, actually, focus on what we're going to do about this situation instead of fighting?

Character 1: So, like, what do you [very quietly] suggest then, since apparently, um, all my ideas are, honestly, terrible?

Character 2: I never said your ideas were terrible—stop putting words in my mouth. What I'm suggesting is we look at this together, objectively, without all this emotional charge you're bringing to the table.

Character 1: Emotional charge? Uh, you're the one who, basically, ambushed me with this, you know?

Character 2: Ambushed? We've had this, hmm, scheduled for a week—it's literally called, well, "financial review meeting" on your calendar. How is discussing, er, finances in a financial meeting an ambush exactly?

Character 1: Because, um, you already made up your mind about everything before we, sort of, even started talking, anyway.

Character 2: That's completely untrue and you know it. I came here with data and concerns, hoping we could brainstorm together, but you've been defensive from the first word I spoke.

Character 1: Oh please, you love being [playful] right about everything, don't pretend otherwise.

Character 2: This isn't about being right or wrong—it's about keeping our company alive. Can we please, please just work together on this instead of turning it into a battle?

Character 1: Fine, but I still think you're [upset] overreacting to temporary cash flow issues.

Character 2: Temporary? We're hemorrhaging, like, forty thousand a month with, basically, [cry loudly] zero revenue coming in—that's not, um, temporary, that's... that's actually, terminal if we don't act now.
