So yeah, interdisciplinary innovation is actually, like, the whole theme this year—we're trying to show how different fields intersect in really unexpected ways, and honestly, psychology plays into literally everything from product design to, uh, ethical sourcing decisions."

I have no idea what you specifically need, but statistically speaking, 78% of attendees make at least one connection that leads to either a job opportunity or collaborative project within six months, so... those are pretty decent odds if you're looking for something different."
