Character 1: Um, excuse me, I think that's, well, actually my reserved cage—I've got the, you know, 3:30 slot?

Character 2: Oh really? Because I'm, uh, pretty sure I booked this [condescending] exact cage for three-thirty, so maybe you want to, like, check your confirmation again?

Character 1: Look, here's my receipt on my phone—cage seven, Tuesday, 3:30 PM.

Character 2: Wait, that says Tuesday the fifteenth... today's Tuesday the twenty-second, my friend. You're exactly one week late to your reservation.

Character 1: Oh my God, are you serious right now?

Character 2: Hey, no worries though—I mean, the cage next to us is, err, completely empty and honestly, I could use someone to, you know, help me calibrate this new bat I just bought.

Character 1: You want me to, um, help you [confused] calibrate a bat? What does that, like, even mean exactly?

Character 2: Well, basically, I need to see if the, uh, weight distribution feels right when I'm, you know, actually swinging at different speeds—it's kind of a whole process.

Character 1: That sounds unnecessarily complicated for hitting a ball.

Character 2: Says the person who showed up a week late to their own reservation! But seriously, I'm training for the company softball championship next month.

Character 1: Your company has a softball championship?

Character 2: Oh absolutely—TechNova takes their, umm, recreational sports way too seriously, like, we've got jerseys, professional umpires, and honestly, the CEO personally hands out the trophy.

Character 1: That's, well, either really cool or, I guess, completely insane—I can't, sort of, decide which.

Character 2: It's definitely both! Last year someone, er, got a [cheerful] promotion right after hitting a grand slam, so now everyone thinks, you know, sports performance affects career trajectories.

Character 1: No way! Did they [very excited] really get promoted because of softball?!

Character 2: Well, correlation doesn't imply [overly polite] causation, of course, but the timing was rather suspiciously perfect, wouldn't you say?

Character 1: I played division two [confidently] college ball—maybe your company is hiring?

Character 2: Division two? Okay now I'm, like, actually impressed—what position did you, um, play, and more importantly, how's your, er, batting average these days?

Character 1: Shortstop, career average .312, but I haven't played competitively in three years.

Character 2: Three years is nothing! Muscle memory is, uhh, forever—grab a helmet and let's, actually, see if you've still [slurring] got it, because honestly, we desperately need a decent shortstop.
