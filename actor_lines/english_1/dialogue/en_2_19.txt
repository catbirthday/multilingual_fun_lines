Character 1: So, um, have you been [mumbling] doing this archery thing for, like, very long, I mean?

Character 2: Not really, I started about six months ago after watching this documentary about medieval warfare, which seems completely unrelated to modern target archery but somehow got me hooked on the whole concept.

Character 1: Well, you seem, uh, pretty good at it from here, you know, considering.

Character 2: That's kind of you to say, but honestly, I spend more time, er, adjusting my stance than actually shooting—like right now, I've been, basically, standing here for five minutes just thinking about elbow position.

Character 1: Hmm, isn't that, I guess, overthinking it a bit, actually?

Character 2: Maybe, but there's something [very loudly] beautiful about the pursuit of perfect form, even if it means I only shoot three arrows per hour while everyone else is on their fifth round.

Character 1: I keep missing the target [trailing off] completely...

Character 2: Missing is just data collection [monotone] about what doesn't work, though I suppose that's not very helpful when you've collected the same data fifty times without changing anything.

Character 1: So, should I, you know, adjust my grip or, um, something?

Character 2: You could try that, or you could spend the next twenty minutes researching ancient Japanese kyudo philosophy like I did last week, which didn't improve my accuracy but definitely made me feel more cultured.

Character 1: I thought this would be [regretful] easier than it is.

Character 2: Everything looks easier from the outside, but that's what makes it inspiring in a way—the struggle itself becomes more interesting than the success, though I'm not sure my instructor agrees with that philosophy.

Character 1: Your instructor seems pretty intense.

Character 2: Oh, she's wonderful at teaching technique, but I keep derailing her lessons with questions about the historical significance of different arrow fletching patterns, which probably isn't the most productive use of lesson time.

Character 1: Actually, I was thinking, er, maybe I should just, you know, quit while I'm behind.

Character 2: No no no, quitting now would be, [animated] uhh, such a waste because, I mean, you're right at that point where, honestly, everything clicks—or at least that's what I keep telling myself every week!

Character 1: Well, how long did it, um, take you to, like, actually hit the target consistently?

Character 2: Still working on that consistency part, but last week I hit three [excited] bullseyes in a row, then spent the next hour trying to recreate it and hitting everything except the target!

Character 1: Okay so, the thing is, should I, err, focus on form or just, basically, try to hit something?

Character 2: In theory you should master the fundamentals first, but, hmm, in practice I've been, sort of, doing both badly simultaneously, which is, you know, probably why I'm still here every weekend making minimal progress!
