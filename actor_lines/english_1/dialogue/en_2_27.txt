Character 1: Oh no, I mean, that sounds absolutely terrible, you know, what you went through with your mom and everything, like, I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you growing up.

Character 2: Well, it wasn't, um, easy but honestly I've learned to see it as part of what, you know, shaped who I am today—therapy helped me process a lot of the anger I carried for years.

Character 1: God, yes, therapy is so important, and you were so brave to go through all that work, I mean really, most people just bottle everything up and let it eat away at them forever but you actually faced it head on.

Character 2: I guess, facing it was the only way forward, er, though it took me, basically, three different therapists before I found one who really understood what I needed to hear.

Character 1: Three therapists! That must have been [laugh hard] so frustrating, but also kind of, you know, hilarious in hindsight, like, going through all those intake sessions over and, um, over again.

Character 2: Oh god, the intake [laugh histerically] paperwork alone could have been its own form of torture! But each one taught me something, even if it was just what approach didn't work for me.

Character 1: That's such a healthy way to, hmm, look at it, I mean, most people would be so, actually, discouraged after one bad experience but you kept trying and that's just incredibly inspiring.

Character 2: Inspiring? I was just [furious] desperate to feel normal! There's nothing noble about stumbling through mental health services trying to find someone who doesn't make you feel worse.

Character 1: No no no, you're right, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to romanticize your struggle, that was thoughtless of me, I just get so excited when I hear about people overcoming challenges and sometimes I forget how painful the actual experience was.

Character 2: It's okay, I know you [very quickly] mean well and honestly your enthusiasm is kind of refreshing compared to people who get uncomfortable and change the subject whenever mental health comes up.

Character 1: Oh absolutely, the thing is, people get so [bored] weird about mental health stuff, uhh, like suddenly everyone needs to check their phone or, basically, remember an urgent appointment they forgot about.

Character 2: Right? And then, er, they wonder why no one opens up to them about, honestly, anything real—it's like they've trained everyone around them to keep things surface level.

Character 1: Exactly! And then those same people complain about feeling disconnected from others or say things like "nobody really talks anymore" when they're literally the ones shutting down every meaningful conversation.

Character 2: Yeah, though I [hesitantly] sometimes wonder if they're just scared of their own stuff coming up. When someone else shares deeply, it can trigger your own unprocessed emotions.

Character 1: Oh my god, yes, that's [sniffle] so true, I'm getting emotional just thinking about all the times I've done that myself, pushed people away when they were being vulnerable because it touched something raw in me.

Character 2: See, but recognizing that pattern is [passionately] huge! Most people never even get to that level of self-awareness—they just keep repeating the same defensive behaviors forever.

Character 1: You're being so, well, kind about this but, you know, I still feel terrible about all the times I've probably, um, made someone feel unheard or dismissed.

Character 2: We've all been there. The difference is whether you learn from it and do better next time, which clearly you're already doing by even having this conversation.

Character 1: God you're just, honestly, such a good person, like, here I am basically making your trauma story about my own guilt and, er, you're still being so patient and understanding with me.

Character 2: Ha! I'm not that patient, trust me. But I appreciate that we can talk about this stuff without it getting weird or overly formal—real connection happens in these messy conversations.
