=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So they're completely restructuring our department again. Third time in two years. I don't even know who my manager is supposed to be anymore.

Character 2: That's the problem with these top-down reorganizations. They shuffle the org chart around without actually addressing the fundamental issues that made the previous structure fail in the first place.

Character 1: The email said we're supposed to be "excited about the opportunities" this brings. What opportunities exactly?

Character 2: [very sincerely] I know it feels like corporate doublespeak, but sometimes these shake-ups do create unexpected pathways. When they merged my old team with procurement, I ended up discovering I had a real talent for vendor negotiations.

Character 1: They're bringing in some external consultant to "facilitate the transition" next week.

Character 2: [mumbling] Those consultants always come in with their frameworks and their change curves and their stakeholder matrices. Half the time they just repackage what employees have been saying for years and charge six figures for it.

Character 1: Have you heard anything about who's actually going to lead the new structure?

Character 2: [jealous] Apparently they're promoting Jennifer from the Seattle office to oversee everything. She's been here half as long as most of us but somehow always lands these high-visibility roles.

Character 1: Jennifer? The one who gave that presentation about synergies last quarter?

Character 2: [sarcastic] Oh yes, the synergy expert herself. I'm sure her extensive eighteen months of experience will really help us navigate this complex transition.

Character 1: [upset] This is such garbage! We just finally got our processes working smoothly and now we have to start all over again!

Character 2: The worst part is they never seem to learn from previous reorganizations. We went through this exact same chaos when they tried to go "agile" in 2019, and here we are doing it again.

Character 1: Do you think people are going to start jumping ship? I've already heard Dave talking to recruiters.

Character 2: [apologetic] I hate to say it, but I've been updating my resume too. After three rounds of this, you start to see the writing on the wall about where the company's priorities really lie.

Character 1: Maybe we should just ride it out? See what happens?

Character 2: [cheerful] You know what, you're right! Sometimes these transitions reveal opportunities you never expected. Plus, with Dave and others leaving, there might be more room for advancement.

Character 1: I guess the severance packages have been pretty generous if they decide to cut people.

Character 2: Six months salary plus benefits continuation isn't bad at all. In this job market, that's actually enough cushion to be selective about your next move rather than taking the first offer.

Character 1: [gasp] Wait, did you just say six months? I heard it was only three!

Character 2: [enunciating every word] Six. Full. Months. For. Anyone. Over. Two. Years. I confirmed it with HR yesterday when I was fishing for information about the restructuring timeline.
