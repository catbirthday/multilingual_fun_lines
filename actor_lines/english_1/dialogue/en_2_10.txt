Character 1: Did you see that email about the new parking policy?

Character 2: Yeah, I saw it and [empathetically] I know it's hitting everyone pretty hard. They're basically cutting our spots in half while doubling the monthly fee.

Character 1: It's [joking] almost like they want us to quit.

Character 2: Well, you know, the timing is, uhh, suspicious considering they just, I mean, announced record profits last quarter.

Character 1: So, are people, like, actually going to, um, do anything about it or, basically, just complain?

Character 2: People will complain for, hmm, about two weeks then, [condescending], accept it because, you know, that's what always happens here. Nobody actually pushes back on anything substantial.

Character 1: That's depressing.

Character 2: It is depressing but it's also predictable corporate behavior. They test how much they can take away before people actually revolt.

Character 1: I guess, the thing is, we could, er, organize something, honestly, if people cared enough.

Character 2: We could try but [frustrated] I've attempted organizing pushback three times before. People sign petitions then chicken out when management starts asking questions.

Character 1: Three times? What happened?

Character 2: First was healthcare cuts, umm, second was, [relieved], mandatory unpaid overtime, and, actually, third was when they eliminated remote work. Each time people folded within days.

Character 1: But, like, this feels different, you know, because parking affects, uhh, literally everyone.

Character 2: It affects everyone which, anyway, means everyone has, sort of, something to lose if they, well, stick their neck out. That's exactly why nothing will change.

Character 1: Okay so, we just, err, accept it and, basically, move on like, hmm, always?

Character 2: Or we document everything and file a formal complaint with the labor board. They can't retaliate against a legitimate legal filing.

Character 1: Would that, actually, even work though, I mean, or would they, uhh, just find other ways to, honestly, make our lives miserable?

Character 2: They'd probably make things uncomfortable but at least we'd have legal protection. Better than rolling over again.

Character 1: You're [very slowly] right, we should at least try something.

Character 2: Tomorrow at lunch let's draft that complaint together. If we're going down, might as well go down swinging instead of whimpering.
