Character 1: So, um, I noticed you've been, like, sitting alone at lunch every day... er, mind if I join you?

Character 2: Oh! I— well, I wasn't [clearing throat] expecting anyone to notice, honestly. Sure, yeah, you can sit if you want, though it's probably not very exciting over here.

Character 1: Actually, I've been, you know, wanting to ask about that, uh, amazing presentation you gave last week—how'd you, like, pull that off?

Character 2: That presentation? I mean, I was [sad] basically terrified the whole time, you know? I practiced it, um, probably fifty times in my bathroom mirror, and I still, er, thought I was going to throw up right before going up there.

Character 1: Really? You seemed so confident up there!

Character 2: Confident? No no no, I was, like, literally shaking—did you not, um, see my hands trembling? I had to, sort of, grip the podium so people wouldn't notice, and honestly, I forgot half of what I wanted to say.

Character 1: Well, I mean, whatever you did say was, uh, pretty brilliant—the boss was, you know, [cry] totally impressed, right?

Character 2: The boss probably just felt [smiling speaking] sorry for me or something. I stumbled over my words at least three times, and I'm pretty sure everyone was just being polite when they clapped.

Character 1: Okay so, you're being, er, way too hard on yourself—I've seen, like, dozens of presentations here and yours was, honestly, top three easy.

Character 2: Top three? That's— I mean, that's really, um, nice of you to say, but I'm sure you're just, well, being kind because I look, sort of, pathetic eating alone every day.

Character 1: Hey, whoa, eating alone doesn't [sniffle] make anyone pathetic.

Character 2: It's just that I never, like, know what to say to people, you know? I always think I'm, er, bothering them or saying something, um, stupid, so I just... don't try anymore.

Character 1: But you're, actually, talking to me right now, and it's going, I mean, pretty well, isn't it?

Character 2: I guess? But you approached [very meekly] me first, which is different. I would never have had the courage to start this conversation myself—never in a million years.

Character 1: Why not though? You're interesting, you're smart, you give killer presentations even if you don't believe it.

Character 2: Those are just work things though—I can hide behind data and PowerPoints. Real conversations where I have to be myself? That's completely terrifying to me.

Character 1: Wait, you think this [gasp] isn't you being yourself right now?

Character 2: This is, um, me trying really hard not to, like, say the wrong thing and make you regret sitting here. I'm basically, er, overthinking every single word before it comes out.

Character 1: Well, for what it's worth, I think the overthinking version of you is pretty great.

Character 2: You— you really mean that? Sorry, I'm not good at accepting compliments either, I just assume people are being nice because they have to be.
