            "content": "Well, it wasn't, um, easy but honestly I've learned to see it as part of what, you know, shaped who I am today—therapy helped me process a lot of the anger I carried for years."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "I guess, facing it was the only way forward, er, though it took me, basically, three different therapists before I found one who really understood what I needed to hear."

            "role": "Character 1",

        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Oh god, the intake [laugh histerically] paperwork alone could have been its own form of torture! But each one taught me something, even if it was just what approach didn't work for me."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "That's such a healthy way to, hmm, look at it, I mean, most people would be so, actually, discouraged after one bad experience but you kept trying and that's just incredibly inspiring."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Inspiring? I was just [furious] desperate to feel normal! There's nothing noble about stumbling through mental health services trying to find someone who doesn't make you feel worse."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "No no no, you're right, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to romanticize your struggle, that was thoughtless of me, I just get so excited when I hear about people overcoming challenges and sometimes I forget how painful the actual experience was."

            "role": "Character 2",

            "content": "Oh absolutely, the thing is, people get so [bored] weird about mental health stuff, uhh, like suddenly everyone needs to check their phone or, basically, remember an urgent appointment they forgot about."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Right? And then, er, they wonder why no one opens up to them about, honestly, anything real—it's like they've trained everyone around them to keep things surface level."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "Exactly! And then those same people complain about feeling disconnected from others or say things like \"nobody really talks anymore\" when they're literally the ones shutting down every meaningful conversation."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Yeah, though I [hesitantly] sometimes wonder if they're just scared of their own stuff coming up. When someone else shares deeply, it can trigger your own unprocessed emotions."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "Oh my god, yes, that's [sniffle] so true, I'm getting emotional just thinking about all the times I've done that myself, pushed people away when they were being vulnerable because it touched something raw in me."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "See, but recognizing that pattern is [passionately] huge! Most people never even get to that level of self-awareness—they just keep repeating the same defensive behaviors forever."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "We've all been there. The difference is whether you learn from it and do better next time, which clearly you're already doing by even having this conversation."

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Ha! I'm not that patient, trust me. But I appreciate that we can talk about this stuff without it getting weird or overly formal—real connection happens in these messy conversations."
