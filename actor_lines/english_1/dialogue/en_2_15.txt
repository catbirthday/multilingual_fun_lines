Character 1: So, I was thinking, you know... maybe we should, um, tell Mom about the accident before she sees the car.

Character 2: Oh God, you're right—she's going to completely lose it when she sees what happened to Dad's Mustang. We need a strategy here, a real plan of attack.

Character 1: Well, the thing is, [pause], we could say it was, er, already like that when we got back?

Character 2: Nobody's going to believe that, I mean, the neighbors literally, uh, saw us leave twenty minutes ago and Mrs. Henderson was, honestly, definitely recording on her phone.

Character 1: She records everything!

Character 2: Remember when she caught Tommy scaling the fence at three AM? Posted it on the neighborhood Facebook page with the caption "Young hoodlum or Romeo?"—that woman has no chill whatsoever.

Character 1: Wait wait wait—Tommy was [laugh loudly] climbing our fence?!

Character 2: You didn't know? He's been, actually, sneaking over to see Rachel for like, um, three months now... though honestly, everyone knows except apparently you.

Character 1: Three months?! And nobody [very sad] told me anything...

Character 2: Hey, don't take it personally—you've been so, well, stressed with the divorce proceedings that we didn't want to, you know, pile on more family drama.

Character 1: The divorce is, uhh, basically done anyway... I guess, finalized yesterday.

Character 2: Jesus, yesterday? Why didn't you call me? You shouldn't have gone through that alone—I would've been there in a heartbeat, you know that.

Character 1: I couldn't, like, make myself dial your number... it's just that, err, saying it out loud makes it too real.

Character 2: Come here, you idiot. It IS real, and that's okay—you're allowed to fall apart, you're allowed to need people, especially your annoying little sister.

Character 1: Since when did you get so, hmm, wise about this stuff, anyway?

Character 2: Since I went through my [joking] own spectacular relationship explosion last year, remember? The one where Greg announced his engagement... at my birthday party... to my roommate?

Character 1: That was, sort of, the most awkward party I've ever, actually, been to in my entire life.

Character 2: The cake said "Happy Birthday" and he [laugh histerically] proposed right as I was blowing out the candles! You can't make this stuff up!

Character 1: At least you got to keep the apartment.

Character 2: Silver linings, right? Though, um, sometimes late at [very quietly] night, I still find her bobby pins in the weirdest places and it's like, you know... tiny little reminders everywhere.
