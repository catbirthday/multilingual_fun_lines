=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about, you know, different ways to give feedback, er, to the team this quarter.

Character 2: Why are you suddenly interested in changing feedback methods? Did someone complain about how you've been doing it, or is HR pushing some new initiative?

Character 1: No, nothing like that. Just trying to improve communication.

Character 2: Right, "improve communication"—that's always code for something. Are they monitoring our one-on-ones now, recording them for compliance or performance reviews?

Character 1: What? No, I genuinely want to help people grow.

Character 2: People don't just randomly decide to overhaul their feedback approach. Someone said something, or you're building a case for something—which is it?

Character 1: Actually, I was, uh, reading this article about, like, sandwich feedback versus, hmm, radical candor approaches.

Character 2: Oh great, so now, er, you're documenting everything we discuss, I guess, under the guise of "radical candor" while, you know, management builds their files on us.

Character 1: That's not what radical candor means at all.

Character 2: Look, whatever new framework you're, uhh, implementing is just another way to, basically, track and quantify our responses, anyway, so they can justify their decisions later.

Character 1: I mean, I'm literally just, well, trying to be a better manager, honestly, nothing sinister here.

Character 2: Every feedback system leaves a paper trail, and paper trails become evidence when they need to restructure or downsize the department.

Character 1: I appreciate your [overly polite] concerns, but this is really just about professional development.

Character 2: Professional development portfolios are the first thing they review when deciding who stays and who goes—you're essentially asking us to document our own weaknesses.

Character 1: Okay so, would you prefer, umm, no feedback at all, like, ever, or what exactly?

Character 2: I prefer feedback that doesn't get weaponized six months later when budget cuts come around and suddenly everyone's "growth areas" become termination justifications.

Character 1: This is getting [sigh] a bit exhausting. Can we just have a normal conversation?

Character 2: Normal conversations don't exist in corporate settings, and the fact that you're, er, [furious] pushing this so hard just confirms, actually, that there's an agenda here you're not sharing.

Character 1: You know what, I'm [angry] kind of done with this paranoid nonsense, honestly, it's just, uhh, completely unproductive.

Character 2: Calling me paranoid is, well, exactly what someone would say when, you know, they're trying to deflect from their actual motives—anyway, I'll participate in your new feedback system, but, hmm, I'm documenting everything too.
