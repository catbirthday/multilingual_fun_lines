Character 1: Why am I even doing this? This is pointless.

Character 2: Hey, I get it—I'm feeling the same resistance right now, but that's exactly why we're doing this together, because when one of us wants to quit, the other one's still typing away.

Character 1: But I haven't written anything decent in, um, weeks and it's like, nothing's coming out right.

Character 2: Well, I'm not writing anything brilliant either, you know, but I'm still here putting words on the page, sort of building momentum even if it feels like pushing through mud right now.

Character 1: You don't understand—I literally can't focus for more than two minutes.

Character 2: Honestly, neither can I today, but that's why, er, we set the timer for just fifteen minutes, because basically even our scattered brains can handle that much commitment.

Character 1: This whole body doubling thing doesn't even work for me.

Character 2: Hmm, it might not feel like it's working, but I guess you're still sitting here with your document open, which, anyway, is more than you'd be doing alone on your couch.

Character 1: Yeah but, uh, the thing is, I'm not actually producing anything worthwhile.

Character 2: Right right.

Character 1: So why are you even bothering? I mean, this is, uhh, such a waste of your time too.

Character 2: Because showing up is half the battle, and I need someone here just as much as you do—we're both fighting our own brain gremlins, just in parallel work spaces.

Character 1: I hate everything I've written today.

Character 2: That's completely valid, and I'm not loving my output either, but we agreed to just exist in this space together without judging the quality, remember?

Character 1: God, this is so [furious] frustrating—why can't I just be normal and productive?

Character 2: Oh, there's no such thing as "normal" productive, and mm, we're both here struggling through the same executive dysfunction, kind of making it less isolating even if it still sucks.

Character 1: I should, err, just give up and accept that I'm really not cut out for this.

Character 2: Look, I've had that exact thought at least twelve times today, but here we both are, still sitting with our work, and that stubborn refusal to leave counts for something.

Character 1: But, ah, what if it's just that we're both, probably, deluding ourselves?

Character 2: Maybe we are, but at least we're deluding ourselves together, and somehow that shared struggle makes it easier to keep my document open for another five minutes.
