=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [loudly] Did you see what happened during our waltz routine?!

Character 2: Oh god, yes, I saw the whole thing unfold. Your partner's heel caught the hem of her dress right at the, um, the pivotal turn sequence, and honestly it looked pretty devastating from where I was sitting.

Character 1: The judges barely even looked up from their scorecards.

Character 2: [cry loudly] I know, it's so unfair! You two had been practicing that routine for months and they just, they didn't even acknowledge what happened! Like, the technical difficulty of recovering from that stumble was actually more impressive than a perfect execution!

Character 1: We're definitely out of the semifinals now.

Character 2: Hmm, well, not necessarily. The scoring system is, er, it's actually more forgiving than you might think, especially if your other dances were strong enough to carry the overall average up, you know?

Character 1: But Marcus and Elena were flawless.

Character 2: Sure, technically flawless, yeah, but their performance was kind of, I mean, it felt rehearsed to death. There was no spontaneity, no actual connection between them, just these perfectly executed movements that, honestly, left me pretty cold.

Character 1: You think we still have a chance?

Character 2: [bored] Look, miracles happen in ballroom all the time. One judge gets food poisoning, another one remembers they hate Elena's coach from twenty years ago, and suddenly you're back in the running for no logical reason.

Character 1: That's not exactly reassuring.

Character 2: Alright so, here's what I genuinely think—your Latin numbers were phenomenal, like truly exceptional, and that cha-cha in particular was, mmm, probably the best I've seen you two perform it ever.

Character 1: The cha-cha felt good.

Character 2: It was more than good though! The way you both interpreted the music was, uh, describably visceral, like you weren't just hitting beats but actually feeling every single note in your bodies, which is rare.

Character 1: My feet are killing me.

Character 2: Oh geez, I bet they are. Those new ballroom shoes are basically medieval torture devices until you break them in properly, and competing for, what, six hours straight? That's absolutely brutal on your arches.

Character 1: I might just quit after tonight.

Character 2: [cry] No, no, you can't quit now! Not when you've come this far and shown everyone what you're capable of! I mean, that waltz mishap aside, you've been dancing with more passion than ninety percent of these competitors!

Character 1: You're just saying that.

Character 2: [sarcastic] Oh absolutely, I love wasting my Saturday nights watching mediocre dancers. Come on, you know I wouldn't be here if I didn't think you had something special, even if tonight was, admittedly, kind of rough.
