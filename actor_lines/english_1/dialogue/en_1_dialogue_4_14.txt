Character 1: Is that a emotional support peacock?

Character 2: Oh! Uhhhh, technically it's a, um, "therapeutic companion bird," but yeah, I mean, basically same thing—they're surprisingly good listeners and honestly way less judgmental than my last therapist, who kept suggesting I quote-unquote "get a normal pet."

Character 1: You can't bring that on a plane.

Character 2: Actually, errr, funny story—turns out you totally can if you buy it its own seat and, like, file the right paperwork, which took me approximately seventeen hours and cost more than my actual ticket but hey, Gerald doesn't do cargo.

Character 1: Gerald. You named your peacock Gerald.

Character 2: Well yeah, I mean, look at him—does he not just radiate Gerald energy? Plus he responds to it now, sort of, if you use the right tone and, uh, have freeze-dried crickets in your pocket, which I always do these days.

Character 1: This is insane. You know that, right?

Character 2: Mmm, see, that's what everyone says until they meet him, and then they're like "oh wow, Gerald really does help with my existential dread," which happened three times in the security line alone—TSA agents are apparently very stressed.

Character 1: [sigh] Where are you even flying with this thing?

Character 2: Phoenix! There's this, um, alternative wellness retreat that specializes in human-animal consciousness alignment, which sounds completely bonkers, I know, but they have a pool and Gerald loves pools, so we're basically going for a spa weekend.

Character 1: A spa weekend. For your peacock.

Character 2: [curious] Wait, have you never taken a pet on vacation? Like, it's actually super therapeutic for both parties—Gerald gets enrichment, I get to not worry about finding a peacock-sitter, which is, uh, surprisingly difficult in suburban Connecticut, turns out.

Character 1: I have a goldfish.

Character 2: Oh perfect! So you totally get the whole, like, non-traditional pet bonding thing—goldfish are actually incredibly emotionally intelligent, despite what people think, and they can recognize faces for up to three months, which is longer than I remember most people honestly.

Character 1: It died. Six years ago.

Character 2: Ahh geez, okay that's... that's rough, I'm sorry—pet loss is genuinely traumatic and, um, society really doesn't give us enough space to grieve our non-human companions properly, which is part of why I started the support group actually.

Character 1: You have a peacock support group?

Character 2: Well no, it's more like a general exotic pet bereavement circle, but we meet Thursdays at the community center and last week someone brought their emotional support tarantula, which was, errr, surprisingly calming once you got past the initial terror factor.

Character 1: Is this my gate? Please tell me this is my gate.

Character 2: [very sincerely] Actually yeah, Gate B7 to Denver—hey look, I know this whole thing seems ridiculous but, um, sometimes the weird stuff is what keeps us going, you know? Anyway, Gerald says safe travels, or at least that's what I'm interpreting from his head bobbing.
