Character 1: [extremely happy] Is this the ferry to the island?

Character 2: Ah, yeah, it is—we're, um, leaving in about seventeen minutes or so. The crossing usually takes, let's see... forty-two minutes when it's calm, but today with that swell coming from the east, probably closer to forty-six.

Character 1: You sound pretty exact about that. Does it even matter?

Character 2: [high-pitched] Twenty-three years on this route, you kind of absorb these rhythms! Every wave pattern, every little wind shift... they all, I mean, they tell their own story if you're actually listening, you know?

Character 1: Twenty-three years. Same water. Same boat. Same everything.

Character 2: Well, same route but, hmm, never the same ocean really. Yesterday we had these dolphins just racing alongside for, gosh, maybe seven minutes? And Tuesday the fog was so thick you literally couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

Character 1: [gasp] Do you ever get tired of pretending it's different?

Character 2: Tired? I mean, no, not really—the water's constantly teaching you something new, honestly. Like last week I figured out this tiny two-degree adjustment that actually saves about three gallons per crossing, which is kind of wild.

Character 1: Three gallons. Wow. Life-changing.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, I know it sounds small, but four crossings daily, six days a week... that's, uh, let me think... 3,744 gallons a year, so those little adjustments really add up over time.

Character 1: You just calculated that? Why bother?

Character 2: [joking] Numbers are basically just patterns, right? Once you see them clearly they kind of solve themselves! Like how this ferry weighs exactly 847 tons but somehow displaces just the right amount of water to, you know, not sink!

Character 1: Everything's just numbers to you. Must be nice.

Character 2: [angry] Look, you spend enough time with something and it becomes part of you, alright? I can literally feel when we're two pounds over optimal trim just from how she responds to the wheel—that's not numbers, that's connection!

Character 1: Two pounds. Sure. Whatever helps you sleep.

Character 2: [upset] The ferry speaks through these, these vibrations—frequency changes with different loads and... most people can't hear it but after two decades your body basically becomes this tuning fork for the ship and I, I don't know why I'm explaining this.

Character 1: [condescending] You're not actually human anymore, are you?

Character 2: Oh, I'm human as they come, just... attentive, I guess. The ocean, it demands complete presence out here—half-attention gets people killed, so you learn to notice everything, or at least you try to.

Character 1: Everything. Right. Must be exhausting.

Character 2: Yeah, well, almost everything anyway. Still can't figure out why that damn vending machine on deck two only takes quarters on Thursdays—that one's, uh, that one's gonna haunt me forever probably.
