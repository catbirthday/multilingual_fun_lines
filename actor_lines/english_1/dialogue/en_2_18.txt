Character 1: Hey, I saw your post about the new coffee shop downtown. Did you end up going?

Character 2: Oh yeah, I, um, actually went yesterday morning, and honestly, it's interesting because, well, from one angle it's totally overpriced, but then again the atmosphere is pretty incredible, you know?

Character 1: Was it [whispering loudly] really that expensive though?

Character 2: So, here's the thing, a latte was, uh, seven dollars which [long pause] seems ridiculous, but then, I mean, if you think about what people pay for, like, cocktails or movie tickets, maybe it's not actually that bad?

Character 1: Seven [whispering] dollars for coffee is insane!

Character 2: I thought that too at first! But then I realized they're paying their workers twenty-two dollars an hour, sourcing beans directly from farmers, and honestly, when you frame it that way, it starts making more sense.

Character 1: Okay but, er, can most people, you know, actually afford that regularly, I mean?

Character 2: That's exactly the problem, right? On one hand, we should support businesses that treat workers fairly, but on the other hand, it creates this exclusivity that goes against what coffee shops traditionally represent—community spaces for everyone.

Character 1: So are you going back or not?

Character 2: Hmm, that's complicated because, like, part of me wants to support their mission, but, well, another part of me thinks, actually, maybe I'm just buying into marketing hype?

Character 1: You're, uh, really overthinking a coffee shop, aren't you, I guess?

Character 2: Maybe I am [over confidently] overthinking it, but then again, where we spend our money is actually a form of voting for the world we want, though I could also argue that individual consumer choices don't really change systemic issues.

Character 1: Now you're just arguing with yourself.

Character 2: I do that a lot, honestly, because most things aren't, er, black and white—like this conversation, right, you probably think I'm, you know, being wishy-washy, but I'd argue I'm just seeing the full picture.

Character 1: Do you ever just pick a side and stick with it?

Character 2: Sometimes I do, but then, um, someone makes a good point and, basically, I realize my position was, sort of, too simplistic, and suddenly I'm seeing five new angles I hadn't considered before.

Character 1: That must be exhausting.

Character 2: It can be, definitely, but I'd rather understand multiple perspectives than be stubbornly wrong, though I guess being certain about things probably feels more comfortable sometimes.

Character 1: So, the thing is, will you give me, like, a straight answer about, actually, whether the coffee was at least, hmm, good?

Character 2: Oh the coffee itself? From a pure taste standpoint it was exceptional, though whether that justifies the price depends entirely on your personal values and financial situation, I suppose.
