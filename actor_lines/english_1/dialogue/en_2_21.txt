Character 1: Um, are we really, you know, at the halfway point already? It's just that, well, it doesn't feel real.

Character 2: Absolutely! We're at marker 250, which means, er, you've raised two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and honestly, the crowd is going wild because this is incredible!

Character 1: Wait, two hundred and fifty thousand? That can't be right.

Character 2: It's completely right, and I mean, the board just updated—we're actually at 251 now, so, like, people are still donating as we speak!

Character 1: This is [furious] insane! We only hoped for a hundred thousand!

Character 2: I know, I know, and here comes marker 252—that's another thousand just in the last thirty seconds, and everyone here is just blown away by what you've accomplished!

Character 1: How many people are watching right now?

Character 2: Over twelve thousand viewers on the stream, and we just hit 253—seriously, the donation counter can barely keep up with how fast these numbers are climbing!

Character 1: I can't believe this is happening.

Character 2: Got it!

Character 1: So, are we, uhh, on track to hit, I guess, our stretch goal? Actually, what even is our stretch goal at this point?

Character 2: Well, the original stretch was 300k, but, um, we're at 254 now, and at this rate, basically, we might need to set a new one because you're crushing it!

Character 1: I'm, err, getting really emotional here, you know, this is just... I mean, it's overwhelming.

Character 2: Take your time, breathe—we're at 255 now, and every single dollar represents someone who believes in this cause, in what you're doing here today.

Character 1: Can you tell me who some of the recent donors are?

Character 2: Sure! We've got Sarah M. with fifty dollars at marker 256, and James from Portland with a hundred, and oh—huge one coming in—anonymous just dropped five thousand, bringing us to 261!

Character 1: Anonymous [deep pitch] donors always make me wonder who they are.

Character 2: Right? It's beautiful though—262 now—and whether they're public or private, every person here is part of something absolutely extraordinary that's changing lives.

Character 1: How much time do we have left?

Character 2: Just under two hours remaining, and, hmm, we're at 263—actually wait, 264—the thing is, at this pace, we might honestly break every record we've ever set!
