Character 1: So I've been [playful] thinking about our burn rate again.

Character 2: Ah. The eternal dance with mortality—financial mortality, that is. We're... accelerating, yes? Eighteen months becomes twelve becomes eight becomes crisis; it's the startup metamorphosis nobody writes about.

Character 1: Well, I mean, we could, umm, cut the marketing budget or, you know, delay the product launch.

Character 2: Cut marketing? Delay launch? No, no, no—that's thinking backwards. We don't retreat into safety; we expand into possibility. What we need isn't less spending but more revenue velocity.

Character 1: More revenue velocity? We barely have any customers.

Character 2: Precisely! And that's... magnificent. Zero to one is infinite growth—mathematically speaking. Every single customer we acquire right now multiplies our trajectory exponentially; we're not failing, we're pre-succeeding.

Character 1: That's one way to look at it.

Character 2: Listen: every unicorn—every single one—had this, uhh, exact moment where the founders, basically, either doubled down or... dissolved. The precipice isn't the enemy; it's the catalyst.

Character 1: What if we're wrong though?

Character 2: Wrong? Wrong! Of course we're wrong—we're, actually, wrong about everything until suddenly, err, we're not. That's the whole point of building something nobody's built before.

Character 1: So, like, you're saying we should, hmm, just ignore the financial reality and, the thing is, hope for the best?

Character 2: Hope? No. Execute—relentlessly. The numbers [cry] whisper doom but the vision... the vision screams possibility. We pivot not from fear but from data; we accelerate not from hope but from conviction.

Character 1: You make it sound so simple.

Character 2: Simple! Ha. Nothing about this is, well, simple—it's beautifully, sort of, catastrophically complex. But complexity isn't the enemy of progress; it's the texture of it.

Character 1: Okay so, you're, honestly, not worried at all about, anyway, running out of money in three months?

Character 2: Three months? Three months is... eternity in startup time. Do you know what we can accomplish in ninety days? Mountains move in ninety days; empires rise and fall in ninety days.

Character 1: That's very poetic but we need actual money.

Character 2: Poetry—yes! But also: math. I've, um, already scheduled twelve investor calls, basically, for next week. The narrative isn't desperation; it's opportunity—growth requiring capital, not failure seeking rescue.

Character 1: You've already, uh, scheduled them? When were you, I guess, planning to, actually, tell me about this?

Character 2: Right... now! Today. This moment—because timing isn't just, you know, everything; it's the only thing. We announce internally tomorrow, pitch Monday, and, well, either we close or we... transcend into whatever comes next.
