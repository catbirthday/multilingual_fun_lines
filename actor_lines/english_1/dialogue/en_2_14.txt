Character 1: Pass the stuffing before Uncle Jerry tells another fishing story.

Character 2: Too late—he's already winding up with the hand gestures! Quick, stuff your mouth with potatoes so you can't respond, it's the only defense that works reliably.

Character 1: Is that cranberry sauce or congealed regret?

Character 2: Both! Mom made it from scratch this year, which apparently means she added existential dread as the secret ingredient—tastes like disappointment with a hint of cinnamon.

Character 1: Why is, um, Aunt Linda's casserole, you know, glowing like that—is it, err, supposed to be radioactive?

Character 2: She discovered Pinterest last month and now everything she makes has at least seventeen ingredients that shouldn't exist in the same universe, let alone the same dish.

Character 1: Dad's doing his turkey speech again.

Character 2: Oh no, he's getting [gasp] emotional about the pilgrim—I mean, we've heard this, actually, thirty-seven times but somehow it gets longer every year!

Character 1: Twenty bucks says Grandma brings up your dating life before dessert.

Character 2: Absolutely not taking that bet—she's already been eyeing me like a hawk since I walked in solo, preparing her list of eligible grandchildren from her bridge club.

Character 1: She's making her [gasp softly] move toward you right now.

Character 2: Abort mission! I'm going to, well, hide in the bathroom—no wait, honestly, that's where cousin Tommy's been crying about his, um, cryptocurrency losses all evening.

Character 1: So, uh, speaking of disasters, [friendly] remember when you, basically, set the turkey on fire, like, three years ago?

Character 2: That was not my fault! The recipe said, you know, "flambe" and I thought, err, why not make it spectacular—nobody told me, honestly, you're not supposed to use half a bottle of brandy!

Character 1: The ceiling still has that scorch mark.

Character 2: Mom refuses to paint [speeding up] over it because she says it's a reminder of why I'm permanently banned from all cooking duties forever and ever amen.

Character 1: Is that why you brought store-bought rolls?

Character 2: Listen, I, actually, tried to make them from scratch but they turned out, well, harder than hockey pucks—even the dog wouldn't, you know, touch them.

Character 1: At least you didn't [joking] poison anyone this year.

Character 2: Yet! The night is still [very sad] young and Uncle Jerry just opened his homemade wine that tastes suspiciously like paint thinner mixed with regret and false hopes.
