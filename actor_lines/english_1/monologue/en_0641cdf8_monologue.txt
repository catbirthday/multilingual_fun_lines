=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] I just logged in and the number—holy shit, the actual number is there. Um, we did it. We actually did it. I mean, [laughing] I keep refreshing because like, there's no way this is real, right? Three years ahead of schedule. Three! [pause] God, I remember sitting in your office that first time, basically drowning in debt and you were all, "trust the process," and I was thinking—honestly, I thought you were kind of full of it. [chuckle] But here's the thing, uh, every single strategy you laid out, every—wait, I need to call my mom. No, actually, [whispering] I don't think I can say it out loud yet. It's like if I tell someone it might disappear or something. [sigh] You know what's crazy? I was so focused on hitting the number that I never really thought about what comes after. Like, tomorrow I could literally just... not go to work? [nervous laugh] That's terrifying. But also, I mean, liberating? Is that the right word? [very quietly] Thirty-eight years old and I'm done with the rat race. We really pulled this off. Hmm, I should probably buy you like, the world's biggest bottle of champagne or something.
