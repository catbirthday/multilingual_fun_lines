[pause] Though I guess... well, you mentioned something about, er, video interviews? [confused] I don't—I mean, how do you shake hands through a computer? \n\n[clearing throat] Anyway, the thing is, loyalty to a company, that's what matters. You stay thirty years, they take care of you with, like, a pension and— [trailing off] wait, you said nobody does pensions anymore? [melancholic] Oh. Right, I forgot about that whole... hmm, 401-whatever thing you mentioned.\n\n[frustrated] It's just—when did everything become so complicated? Like, you need five apps just to, I don't know, apply for one job? [sigh] In my day, you literally walked in with a resume on actual paper, and— [slowly] and now you're telling me nobody even, um, reads those cover letters I helped you write?\n\n[very quietly] Maybe I don't actually know how to help you anymore. [long pause] The world just sort of... [sad] it moved on without me really noticing, didn't it? All my advice is basically, uh, what do you kids say—obsolete?"
