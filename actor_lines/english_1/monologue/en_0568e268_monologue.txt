Subject: Forgiving the person who hurt you most and feeling simultaneously free and empty

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] I finally did it. Um, I told Marcus I forgive him. After everything—the lies, the betrayal, all of it. [pause] And honestly, I thought I'd feel... I don't know, triumphant? But it's like, [very quietly] there's just this massive hole where all my anger used to live. 

[sigh] You know what's weird? I carried that rage around for, what, three years? And now it's just—gone. [confused] Like, shouldn't I feel lighter or something? I mean, I guess I do, sort of, but it's more like I'm... floating? [shaky voice] Without the weight of hating him, I don't even recognize myself anymore.

He just sat there while I said it. Didn't cry, didn't apologize again, just—anyway, [bitter] maybe that's better. The thing is, I needed to let go, right? For me, not for him. [relieved] And I do feel free, I really do. It's just that, um, freedom turns out to be terrifyingly empty. 

[very sad] All that time I spent replaying what he did, planning what I'd say—[trailing off] that was my whole life, basically. And now? [long pause] Now I have to figure out who I am without this thing that's been defining me. [whispering] I forgive you, Marcus. And somehow, er, that means I have to start over completely.
