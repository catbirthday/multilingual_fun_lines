Subject: Your wanderer years giving you the exact life experience needed to help a suicidal stranger find reasons to keep going

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I saw him standing on that bridge at, um, three in the morning and I just—I knew that look. [pause] You know? Like, the way he was gripping the railing, it's... [very slowly] I recognized myself from five years ago. Back when I was, er, sleeping in my car, basically living off gas station coffee and—[bitter] God, those were the wandering years, right? [short pause] Anyway, I walked over and just, hmm, started talking about the sunrise I saw in Montana once. [warm] How it hit these mountains and I literally cried because it was so—[trailing off] I don't know. [sigh] And then, [empathetically], I told him about the old woman in Denver who gave me her lunch when I hadn't eaten in, like, two days. The bartender in Austin who, uh, let me wash dishes for meals. [very quietly] All these tiny kindnesses that kept me going when I was just... floating. [laugh] He actually laughed when I told him about getting stuck in that, err, ridiculous snowstorm in Wyoming. [passionately] The thing is, those years of having absolutely nothing taught me that sometimes—[pause] sometimes you find everything in the smallest moments. [very sincerely] A stranger's smile, honestly, or a, you know, perfect cup of coffee. [relieved] He stepped back from the edge. We talked until sunrise.
