Subject: Your adoption social worker recommendation was overruled, placing a child with a family you knew wasn't right

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: They called me yesterday to tell me the placement board went with the Millers. [bitter] After everything I documented, right? I mean, the home visits where the wife literally couldn't— [frustrated] she couldn't even look at Maya's photo without flinching. And honestly, the thing is, [shaky voice] I've been doing this for twelve years, okay? Twelve years. [pause] You develop a sense for these things, you know? Like when someone's performing versus when they're, um, actually ready to parent a traumatized child. [very quietly] Maya needs stability, she needs someone who understands that her tantrums aren't about defiance, they're about— [sigh] God, it's like talking to a wall sometimes with these boards. [angry] They see a nice house, dual income, and suddenly my three months of assessments mean nothing? [long pause] The husband kept calling her "the child" during interviews. Not Maya, just "the child." [sad] And I'm supposed to, what, just file my report and move on? [anxious] I keep thinking about her little backpack, how she, uh, clutches it like it's the only thing that's really hers. [crying while speaking] She deserves better than people who want a child as an accessory. [regretful] I should've pushed harder, I should've— [trailing off] I don't know... maybe insisted on another review or something.
