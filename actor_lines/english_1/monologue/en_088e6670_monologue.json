[extremely happy] The Stanford program, the actual Stanford program that we've been, like, obsessing over for literally three years? I can't—hold on, let me just... [long pause] \n\nOkay so, um, I knew you were brilliant, obviously I married you, but honestly? [shaky voice] Part of me thought maybe we were being, you know, too ambitious with this whole thing. And here you are just—God, I'm so proud of you. [sniffle] Like ridiculously, stupidly proud. \n\nWait wait wait, when do you start? [excited] Oh man, we're really doing this, aren't we? Moving to California, the whole thing, everything we talked about at like 2 AM when we couldn't sleep. Remember how we'd just lie there and, uh, basically plan out our entire future? [warm] And now it's actually happening, it's not just some fantasy anymore.\n\n[crying while speaking] I'm sorry, I'm being such a mess right now but I just—the thing is, you worked so hard for this. All those late nights, the applications, and then when you got rejected last year... [passionately] But you didn't give up, you just kept going, and now look at you! My brilliant, stubborn, incredible spouse. [laugh] We need champagne. Like, immediately."
