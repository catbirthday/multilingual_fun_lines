God, you should've seen his face when I just—when I didn't back down this time. [angry] Three years of this crap and I finally said what I've been rehearsing in my head every single night. \n\n[pause] \n\nBut then Mrs. Chen pulled me aside after and... oof. She told me about his situation. [confused] I didn't know his dad was—I mean, how would I know, right? Nobody talks about that stuff. [hesitantly] She said he comes to school with bruises sometimes, hidden ones, and that CPS has been... they've been involved for months now. \n\n[very quietly] He literally flinched when I raised my voice at him. \n\nI keep thinking about all those times he shoved me around and now I'm wondering if that's just... is that what happens to him at home? But worse? [sad] Like, that doesn't make what he did okay, obviously, it doesn't erase three years of hell, but... hmm... I don't know what to do with this information. [sigh] Part of me is still furious, you know? But another part is just... God. [empathetically] Nobody deserves that. Not even Jake."
