=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Two years? She just told me—Maria just told me it's been two years clean and I... [pause] I had no idea I was even helping. She said my texts, um, the stupid little memes I sent every morning, the coffee dates where I just—[shaky voice] where I just talked about nothing important—she said those kept her going. 

[crying while speaking] I thought I was being annoying, honestly. Like, bothering her too much when she was struggling. But she said... [sniffle] she said on her worst days, knowing I'd check in, knowing someone believed she could do it even when she didn't say what she was fighting—

God, I just sent her cat videos. [laugh] Cat videos and bad jokes and, you know, reminded her about our weekend plans. [warm] She framed the screenshot. The one where I told her she was stronger than she knew. I don't even remember sending it, but she—she kept it on her mirror.

[very sincerely] Two years. Two whole years she's been fighting this battle and I... I'm so proud of her. [happy] And maybe, I mean, maybe just showing up for people matters more than we think? Even when we don't know exactly what they're going through.
