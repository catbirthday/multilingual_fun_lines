=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] So, um, here we are. The wedding's in three months and I'm supposed to just—I mean, what am I supposed to do? [pause] Smile and pretend like nothing happened? Like they didn't, you know, completely devastate my kid two years ago? [angry] I still remember that phone call, the crying, the—[sigh] anyway. 

[frustrated] The thing is, er, my daughter says she's happy now. Says they've "grown" or whatever. [sarcastic] Right. People change. Sure. [hesitantly] But honestly, I keep wondering if I should, like, pull them aside and just... I don't know. [stern] Make it clear that I remember everything? 

[very quietly] Here's the thing though—she really does seem happy. [confused] And that's what matters, right? I guess? [groan] God, this is so hard. I mean, basically I have to stand there, [upset] shake their hand, welcome them to the family, when all I really want to do is—[trailing off] 

[resigned] Well. [slowly] I suppose I'll do what fathers do. Smile for the pictures. [warm] Keep my daughter happy. [whispering] But they better not hurt her again. [very sincerely] Because this time, um, this time I won't just sit back and watch her cry. [pause] I won't.
