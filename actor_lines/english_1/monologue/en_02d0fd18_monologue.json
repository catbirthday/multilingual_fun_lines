But last week, when I'm—[pause] when I'm hiding that family in the same compartment where I used to stash cocaine, I mean, suddenly everything just... [emotional] Their little girl, she couldn't have been more than six, right? [clearing throat] And she's clutching this, um, this ratty stuffed rabbit like it's the only thing keeping her alive. \n\n[quietly] You know what's fucked up? I'm using the exact same routes, same bribes, basically the same border guards who, uh, who used to wave me through with kilos of heroin. [sarcastic] Except now they think I'm some kind of saint or something. [laugh] Yeah right. \n\nThe thing is, er, I'm actually good at this—[confident] like really good at it. All those years learning how to, you know, read a checkpoint guard's body language, or knowing exactly when to floor it and when to play it cool... [trailing off] \n\n[warm] Yesterday that family sent me a photo. They're in Berlin now, and the little girl—[sigh] she's still got that rabbit. [very quietly] Maybe I actually did something that matters for once. [pause] I don't know, maybe those wasted years weren't completely wasted after all."
