So, um, remember that kid Marcus who crashed on my couch for like three months back in... what was it, 2018? Well, he just—[laugh] I mean, the thing is, he's apparently running this whole housing nonprofit now. Like an actual organization with, you know, staff and everything. \n\n[warm] And here's what gets me, right? He wrote that I basically saved his life back then. Which is just—I don't know, it wasn't even a big deal, you know? He needed a place, I had a couch, so... [trailing off] anyway, that's what you do.\n\nBut now he's like—[excited] oh my God, he's housed over 200 people this year! Two hundred! And apparently, uh, they have this policy where nobody gets turned away if they're really desperate, which is exactly—[pause] that's literally what I told him that first night when he was all apologetic about not having rent money.\n\n[sniffle] Sorry, I'm just... the thing is, you never really know, do you? When you're just being decent to someone, I mean. [very sincerely] He said in the email that every single person they help, er, it all traces back to that ugly brown couch in my living room. [laugh softly] God, I'm actually crying over this."
