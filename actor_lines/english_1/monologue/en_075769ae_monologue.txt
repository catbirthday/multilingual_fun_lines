Subject: Getting fired as a revenue cycle analyst after discovering your company has been illegally billing patients

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I can't believe they actually fired me. Like, I found—I mean, I literally discovered they were double-billing Medicare patients for, um, procedures that never even happened, and somehow I'm the one clearing out my desk? [bitter] You know what's really twisted? They called it "performance issues." [laugh] Performance issues! I've been there for, what, six years? Never a single complaint until I sent that email to compliance about the, uh, the phantom billing codes.

[angry] The thing is, Mrs. Henderson—she's eighty-three—she was getting charged for dialysis treatments she never received. Honestly, how was I supposed to just... ignore that? [sarcastic] But sure, I'm the problem here, right? Not the executives who've been, you know, basically stealing from sick people for God knows how long.

[long pause]

My manager, he actually—[exhausted] he pulled me aside last week and said, "Sometimes it's better not to look too closely at the numbers." Can you believe that? I mean, that's literally my job. Was my job. [very quietly] I kept copies of everything, though. Every fraudulent claim, every fake procedure code. 

[sigh] So yeah, I'm unemployed, but at least I can, um, sleep at night knowing I didn't just let them keep stealing from people who are already struggling with medical bills. [trailing off] I just hope the whistleblower hotline actually does something with what I sent them...
