Subject: Your breadwinner sacrifices finally paid off when your kids surprised you with a family vacation they saved up for

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: They just handed me this envelope and I thought it was gonna be, I don't know, another bill or something. [confused] But then I opened it and there's these plane tickets? And hotel reservations, and... [pause] wait, is this real? [emotional] Oh my god, they saved up for this. My kids saved up their money to take me on vacation. [crying while speaking] All those extra shifts, all those weekends I missed their games, and they... [sniffle] I can't believe they did this. 

You know what Sarah said? [warm] She said "Dad, you've given us everything, now it's our turn." Can you believe that? [extremely happy] My babies aren't babies anymore! They're these incredible people who... who saw how tired I've been and actually, um, they actually did something about it. [laugh] 

God, I feel so... I mean, part of me feels guilty, like they shouldn't have to spend their money on me, but also just... [very sincerely] I'm so proud of them. All those years of rice and beans for dinner, telling them we'd travel "someday," and here they are making someday happen for me. [shaky voice] This is the best thing anyone's ever done for me. [pause] We're really going. [delighted] We're really going on this trip together!
