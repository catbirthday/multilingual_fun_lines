[extremely happy] Mrs. Henderson, did you organize this? Of course you did, you're always asking about my life and I just thought you were being, um... being nice. [sniffle] This is so—I don't even know what to say. You know, I've been working here for what, three years now? And I always thought I was just, you know, the person who gets your coffee and rings up your croissants. [warm] But you actually pay attention to me. Like, really pay attention. Mr. Garcia, you brought candles! [laugh] And Tommy, oh my God, you're filming this aren't you? My mascara is probably everywhere right now. [very sincerely] I just... hmm, I wasn't expecting anyone to remember. My family's all back in Ohio and I was just gonna, I don't know, buy myself a cupcake after my shift or something. [crying while speaking] But this is so much better. You guys are like—you're my morning family, you know? Every day at 6 AM, there you are. [cheerful] Should I make a wish? Wait, what do I even wish for when you've already given me this? [pause] Okay, okay, I'm blowing out the candles before I completely lose it and cry all over this beautiful cake."
