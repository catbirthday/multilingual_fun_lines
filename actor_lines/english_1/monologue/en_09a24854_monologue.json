[pause] But it's right there, I mean, every single month for the past—[very quietly] God, it goes back to January. [shaky voice] Twenty here, fifty there, sometimes, uh, sometimes a hundred. \n\n[angry] How could she—[pause] sorry, I'm just... [sigh] This is Rachel we're talking about. Rachel! [upset] We've been friends since, what, middle school? And she's just been, like, taking money this whole time while I'm sitting here [frustrated] covering for her shifts, defending her to management when she's late, and the whole time she's—[bitter] Jesus Christ.\n\n[very sad] The thing is, um, I keep thinking maybe there's an explanation? [hesitantly] Like maybe she needed it for something and was too, er, too embarrassed to ask? But then [stern] that doesn't make it okay, right? You don't just steal from your job—from *our* job—[trailing off] where we both work together every day...\n\n[crying while speaking] I have to report this. [sniffle] I know I do. But honestly, how do I even—[shaky voice] how do I look her in the eye tomorrow? [exhausted] God, this is such a mess."
