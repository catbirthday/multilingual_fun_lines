Subject: The courtesan lifestyle is paying for your medical school, but you're losing pieces of yourself along the way

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] Another envelope of cash today. Twenty-five hundred dollars, just... sitting there on my nightstand. That's half my tuition for next month. I should feel, um... I should feel grateful, right? But I just stared at it for like ten minutes this morning. 

[bitter] You know what's funny? I aced my anatomy exam yesterday. Top of the class. [short pause] My professor said I have "natural talent for understanding the human body." [laugh] If only he knew. 

The thing is, I'm really good at... at compartmentalizing, I guess? During the day I'm this dedicated med student, and at night I'm—well. Someone else entirely. [sigh] But lately it's getting harder to, uhh, to keep those worlds separate. 

[very quietly] Last week one of my regulars asked what I was studying. [pause] And for a second I actually forgot. Like my brain just... blanked. [shaky voice] How do you forget you're in medical school? 

I keep telling myself it's temporary. Two more years, maybe three. Then I'll be Doctor somebody, and this will all be some weird chapter I never talk about. [sad] But sometimes I wonder if I'm losing parts of myself I'll never get back, you know? 

[whispering] God, I'm so tired.
