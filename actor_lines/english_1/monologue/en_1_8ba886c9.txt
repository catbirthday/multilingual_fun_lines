Subject: Learning your sister-in-law has been lying about her addiction relapse for six months

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] Six months. Six fucking months she's been using again and I— I had no idea. [bitter] All those family dinners, all those times she looked me right in the eye and said she was doing great. "Three years clean," she said at Thanksgiving. [sarcastic] Three years clean while she was probably high at our table. [pause] I keep thinking about all the signs I missed. The weight loss, the— the constant excuses for not coming to things, the way she kept borrowing money from Jake. [upset] God, I'm such an idiot. I actually defended her to my mom last week when she said something seemed off. [short pause] And Jake, he must've known. He had to have known, living with her, seeing her every day. [angry] Which means he's been lying to me too. His own brother. [trailing off] I don't even know what to... [sad] The worst part is, um, I thought we were close. I thought she trusted me enough to— to ask for help if she needed it. [shaky voice] But she didn't. She just kept pretending everything was fine while she was drowning. [sigh] And now I don't know if I'm more hurt or just... worried about what happens next.
