Subject: Your deckhand experience preparing you perfectly for the maritime rescue that saved three lives during the unexpected storm

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] God, when I think about that night... [pause] You know, people keep calling me a hero, but honestly, I was just—I was doing what I'd been trained to do. [confident] Three years as a deckhand, um, you learn things. [speeding up] How to read the water when it gets angry, how to tie knots that won't fail when everything's wet and your hands are shaking— [short pause] Captain Morrison used to make us practice in the worst conditions. [chuckle] I hated him for it back then.

[very sincerely] But that storm came out of nowhere. [anxious] Those people, they were just recreational sailors, you know? Their boat was already taking on water when we spotted them. [passionately] And I just—my body knew what to do! [excited] The rescue lines, the harness setup, even the, uh, the way you have to time your approach with the swells so you don't crash into them— [trailing off] it all just clicked...

[shaky voice] The youngest one was maybe sixteen. [pause] Same age as my nephew. [warm] When I pulled him up, he was crying and saying "thank you" over and over, and I just— [sniffle] All those mornings checking equipment, practicing emergency protocols when I'd rather be sleeping... [extremely happy] it all mattered. [softly] It all actually mattered.
