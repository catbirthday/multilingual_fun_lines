You know, everyone was like—my dad was literally ready to wire the money, I mean, fifty thousand for a \"guaranteed\" investment return? [skeptical] And the guy was so smooth, right? Had all these documents, testimonials, everything. My mom was, um, completely sold on it. [anxious] But something just felt... I don't know, too perfect? Like, nobody guarantees thirty percent returns in six months, that's just—[laugh] that's fantasy land, honestly. [speeding up] So I started digging, and the thing is, his company website was only three weeks old. Three weeks! [pause] And then, uh, I found his photo on a completely different site selling, er, timeshares in Florida. [proud] Different name, same face. [very slowly] When I showed everyone... [sigh] My dad just sat there, kind of stunned. Mom actually started crying because, well, that was their entire retirement fund they were about to— [trailing off] [warm] Now they joke that I'm the family detective, but honestly? [confidently] Sometimes being paranoid actually pays off. I mean, if something seems too good to be true... [chuckle] yeah, it probably is."
