[excited] I was legitimately thrilled for her—like, she worked so hard for it, you know? [warm] I brought her flowers and everything, made this whole big deal about it in the office. [chuckle] I guess I was just... really happy to see someone good actually win for once.\n\n[pause] But here's the thing—[whispering loudly] she told me yesterday that my reaction, like, meant everything to her. [confused] I didn't even realize she was feeling so uncertain about accepting it? [empathetically] Apparently everyone else was being weird and, I don't know, jealous maybe. \n\n[gasp softly] And then she goes, [speeding up] \"I recommended you for the director position in New York.\" [laugh loudly] The DIRECTOR position! [very slowly] That's... two levels above what I am now. \n\n[shaky voice] She said my genuine support showed her the kind of leader she wants on her team, even if—[trailing off] well, even if it means I'd technically be above her.
