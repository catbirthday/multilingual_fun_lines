Subject: Your location scout eye discovering a filming location that revitalizes a struggling small town's economy

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [excited] Oh my God, I just—I mean, I've been scouting locations for, what, fifteen years? But this place, um, [whispering loudly] this could change everything. So basically I'm walking through Main Street, right? And it's like—[sad] there's all these boarded up shops, the diner's barely hanging on, [pause] and then I turn the corner. [gasp] The courthouse, the whole square, it's literally perfect for the period piece. 

But here's the thing, [empathetically] the mayor, she starts crying when I tell her we might film here. Actually crying. She's like, [shaky voice] "You don't understand what this means." And honestly, I didn't at first, but then—[clearing throat] she explains how, you know, the factory closed two years ago. Half the town left. [very quietly] Kids moving away because there's nothing here.

[passionately] But if we bring the production here? We're talking, I don't know, hundreds of crew members needing hotels, restaurants, err, local services. [speeding up] Hiring extras, renting properties, spending money for three months straight! The economic impact report I ran—[laugh] it's insane. Like, genuinely insane.

[warm] I've found beautiful locations before, but this? Actually being able to, um, [very sincerely] help save a town while making our movie? [sigh] That's why I do this job.
