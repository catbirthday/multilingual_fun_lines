Subject: Your rebel phase in college is now embarrassing but also gave you the confidence to start your own business

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [groaning] Oh God, I found my old college photos yesterday. The mohawk, the combat boots, the whole... anarchist phase. [laugh] I mean, I literally had a tattoo that said "question everything" in Sanskrit—except, turns out, it actually says "chicken soup." [embarrassed] My roommate still brings it up at parties. 

[sighing] But you know what's weird? All that ridiculous rebellion, the protests, the manifestos I'd write at 3 AM... [trailing off] I don't know, it actually taught me something. [thoughtful] Like, when you're nineteen and telling your economics professor his entire worldview is wrong—which, okay, mortifying—but you're also learning to, um... to stand behind your ideas. [chuckle] Even the terrible ones.

[slowly] And honestly? Starting my business felt less scary because of it. [confident] I'd already been the person who looked stupid in front of everyone. When investors said my idea wouldn't work, I was like, well, I once organized a sit-in for vegan meal options that nobody showed up to. [laugh loudly] This can't be worse than that.

[warm] So yeah, I cringe at old me, but... hmm, I guess I'm also weirdly grateful? [smiling speaking] That embarrassing kid with questionable fashion choices basically gave me permission to fail. And that's, er, that's everything when you're an entrepreneur. [pause] Even if she did think anarchy symbols made good accessories.
