=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] You know what's funny? I started volunteering at the senior center to teach computer basics just to, um... just to fill my weekends really. [chuckle] But then Gran showed up to my class one day. [surprised] I had no idea she'd even signed up! [trailing off] She was sitting there in the front row with her little notebook and...

[sad] She'd been so isolated since Aunt Maria moved to Portugal. [pause] Eight years without seeing her sister properly. [very quietly] Just those grainy photos on Christmas cards. 

[animated] So I'm teaching her how to click and drag, right? [laugh] She kept double-clicking everything! [passionately] But she was so determined, you know? [slowly] Writing down every single step in that notebook of hers.

[excited] Then one Tuesday, we got her on video call and— [gasp softly] oh my God, when Maria's face appeared on that screen... [crying while speaking] Gran just started sobbing. [sniffle] They were both crying and laughing and talking over each other in this mix of English and Portuguese.

[very sincerely] Now she calls Maria every Sunday morning. [smiling speaking] Shows her the garden, introduces her to the new cat. [relieved] It's like she got her sister back, you know? [warm] And I guess, well... I kind of got my Gran back too. [very quietly] She's just so much more herself now.
