Subject: Your network engineer troubleshooting restored internet to a rural school during state testing

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] Okay, we're back online. All forty-seven terminals showing green. [exhale] God, that was close. [exhausted] Three hours to state testing and the whole district goes dark—of course it does. [pause] These kids only get one shot at this, you know? [frustrated] And they're running everything on infrastructure from 2008. The main router was literally held together with, um... with zip ties and prayer. [sigh] I keep telling them they need redundancy out here, but rural schools, they just don't have the budget. [anxious] When I saw that blinking red cascade across the monitoring dashboard, I thought— [trailing off] I mean, can you imagine? [upset] Two hundred kids sitting there with frozen screens, their whole academic year riding on this test, and nothing. [pause] The principal looked like she was about to cry. [very quietly] Hell, I almost did too. [speeding up] But we got it back, swapped out the failing switch, rerouted through the backup gateway that technically isn't supposed to exist but I, uh... I set up anyway last year. [proud] Sometimes you just have to make things work, regulations be damned. [warm] Those kids are in there right now, clicking away, probably complaining about the test questions instead of the internet. [chuckle] That's how it should be. [very sincerely] This job isn't glamorous, but days like today? When everything almost falls apart and you catch it just in time? [satisfied] Yeah. This is why I do it.
