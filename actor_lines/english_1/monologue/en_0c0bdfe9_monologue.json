[thoughtful] Everyone just kind of—I mean, they didn't even notice him really. [pause] But here's the thing, I wasn't exactly, you know, the popular kid either. [chuckle] I was just... there. Like, literally just existing in the middle of everything, [trailing off] not special enough to be noticed, not weird enough to be picked on...\n\n[empathetically] And I think that's actually why we connected, honestly. Because when you're not trying to, er, maintain some image or whatever, [slowly] you can just... be real with someone. [smiling speaking] I remember the first time we actually talked—well, it was more like I just sat next to him at lunch because everywhere else was full. [laugh] And he had this, um, this comic book he was drawing in, and it was actually incredible. \n\n[animated] The thing is, all those popular kids were so busy with their own, you know, drama and status stuff that they never— [regretful] they missed out on knowing this amazing person. [very sincerely] Marcus taught me about astronomy, about graphic novels, basically opened up this whole world I never knew existed. [happy] And all because I was ordinary enough that he wasn't, uh, intimidated by me. [pause] Sometimes being nobody special is exactly what makes you [confidently] the right person for someone else."
