Subject: Being a professor and having your research funding cut the day before your sabbatical was supposed to start

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] They can't— they can't actually do this, right? I mean, the sabbatical starts tomorrow. Tomorrow! [frustrated] Six years of grant applications, three peer reviews, and they pull funding now? [pause] I already sublet my apartment. [bitter] Yeah, that's— that's perfect timing, Dean Harrison, really stellar administrative work there. [sarcastic] Oh sure, "budget constraints," like we haven't heard that before while they renovate the football stadium for the third time. 

[angry] Do you know what I turned down for this? [slowly] MIT wanted me to collaborate on their neural mapping project, but no, I stayed loyal to this— [groan] God, I'm such an idiot. [very quietly] Twenty years at this institution. Twenty years. [upset] My grad students, they're depending on this research, their dissertations are— [pause] what am I supposed to tell them? "Sorry, kids, um, find a new thesis topic"? 

[exhausted] I can't even process this right now. [laugh] You know what's funny? [bitter] I bought a new laptop yesterday specifically for the sabbatical research. Non-refundable. [furious] They knew. They had to have known last week, and they waited until— [trailing off] I just... [sigh] I need to sit down.
