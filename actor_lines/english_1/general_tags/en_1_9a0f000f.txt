Scenario: An inventory specialist seeks emergency therapy after discovering their meticulous counting rituals have been masking severe OCD that's now threatening their job and relationships.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shakily] So, um, I've been counting the ceiling tiles in your waiting room for the past forty minutes, and there are exactly ninety-six, which is divisible by twelve, and that should make me feel better but it doesn't. [nervous laugh]

Character 2: [gently] That's actually really important that you noticed it didn't bring the relief you expected. When did you first realize that the counting wasn't, uh, just about being good at your job anymore?

Character 1: Last week my girlfriend found me in the kitchen at three AM, reorganizing all the canned goods by expiration date and, errr, manufacturer lot codes. She said I was crying but I don't even remember that part.

Character 2: Mmm, dissociation during compulsive episodes.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Yeah, apparently I've been doing it for months now. My boss thinks I'm this incredible asset because I catch every single discrepancy, but honestly, I can't stop checking even when I know everything's correct.

Character 2: The workplace reinforcement probably made it harder to recognize when healthy diligence crossed into, um, something more consuming. How many times would you say you recheck your counts during a typical inventory?

Character 1: [exhales] Seven. Always seven.

Character 2: [carefully neutral] And if you tried to stop at six, or, uh, push through to eight, what would happen then? What does that feel like in your body?

Character 1: It's like... okay, imagine someone's standing behind you with a loaded gun and they'll pull the trigger if you don't check that seventh time. [voice breaking] My chest gets so tight I can't breathe properly.

Character 2: That level of physical distress is, erhm, exactly what we'd expect with severe OCD. You're not weak for feeling that way—your brain is literally sending danger signals.

Character 1: [self-mocking] The funny thing is, I used to brag about my attention to detail at parties, like it was this superpower or something. Now I realize I was basically bragging about being mentally ill.

Character 2: [firmly] No, you were recognizing a genuine strength that's become, um, hijacked by a treatable condition. Many people with OCD are extraordinarily capable—the disorder often latches onto our best qualities.

Character 1: But what if treating it makes me bad at my job? What if I can't do inventory without the compulsions? [panicked laugh] God, I sound pathetic.

Character 2: [warmly] You sound like someone who's built their identity around coping mechanisms that aren't sustainable anymore. That takes incredible courage to admit, actually.

Character 1: [quieter] My dad used to check the stove exactly twelve times before bed every night. I thought he was just, uh, careful. Now I wonder if maybe this runs in families?

Character 2: Often, yes. [pause]

Character 1: [frustrated laugh] So I'm genetically programmed to be a counter who works as a professional counter? That's either ironic or, errr, completely predictable, I can't decide which.

Character 2: What matters right now isn't why you have OCD, but that you're here, ready to work on it. The fact that you called this morning in crisis and got yourself here—that's the opposite of pathetic.

Character 1: [voice cracking] I almost didn't come because the number on your door is 304 and that's not divisible by seven, which I know sounds completely insane when I say it out loud like this.

Character 2: [compassionately] It doesn't sound insane at all—it sounds like OCD was trying to protect you from change, from getting better. But you walked through that door anyway. [gentle smile] That's pretty powerful, actually.
