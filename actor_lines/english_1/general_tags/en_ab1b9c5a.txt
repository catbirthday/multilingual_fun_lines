=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [gentle] Um, I know this is, [careful], difficult but I need to examine your feet to assess the, [professional], damage—the lacerations appear to be several days old, I mean.

Character 2: [trembling] Well, um, they made us run through the, [breaking], forest at night without shoes as, [hollow], punishment if we tried to, you know, [voice cracking], speak or stop working.

Character 1: [sympathetic] The glass fragments embedded in your heel need to be, [steady], removed but I promise I'll be as gentle as possible. [pause]

Character 2: Every step feels like, [wincing], walking on broken memories of the fourteen months I was, [quiet], kept in that warehouse with twenty-three others who didn't, [trailing off], make it out. [exhales]

Character 1: [soft] Um, these scars on your ankles, well, they look like, [horrified], restraint marks—metal shackles from the pattern, and I mean, [somber], they've cut deep into the tissue.

Character 2: [bitter] The chains were never removed except when they wanted us to, [shaking], run for their entertainment. [long pause]

Character 1: [careful] Your metatarsals show stress fractures from prolonged standing and the tissue damage suggests, [clinical], months of untreated infections.

Character 2: [whispered] Please just fix them.

Character 1: [reassuring] Well, um, the healing will take time but I promise these feet will, [determined], carry you wherever you choose to go from here.

Character 2: [broken] Um, I can't even remember.

Character 1: [gentle] You know, I mean, I've treated many injuries but, [struggling], these tell a story that no human should ever have to endure. [sighs]

Character 2: The hunters called us rabbits and made us, [disgusted], scatter through the woods while they tracked us with dogs. [shudders]

Character 1: [protective] Nobody will ever hunt you again—the authorities have your testimony and those, [firm], monsters will face justice.

Character 2: [hollow] Justice won't bring back the feeling in my toes or the, [cracking], seventeen people who died trying to, [barely audible], escape with me or the childhood they, [lost], stole when I was twelve.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Um, well, I'm going to recommend specialized trauma therapy along with the, [professional], physical rehabilitation because healing isn't just about the body, you know.

Character 2: [exhausted] Um, every night I still hear them, you know, [haunted], coming through the trees and I wake up ready to run even though my feet, well, [broken], can't carry me anymore. [cries softly]

Character 1: [tender] Your feet will heal and when they do, they'll be stronger than before—scar tissue is, [meaningful], remarkably resilient. [pause]

Character 2: [quiet] Sometimes I wonder if surviving was harder than, [distant], dying would have been because now I have to learn how to be, [searching], human again instead of prey.

Character 1: [firm] Well, um, you were always human, I mean, even when they tried to make you believe otherwise—your spirit survived and, [emotional], that's the strongest thing I've ever witnessed.

Character 2: [soft] Thank you for seeing me as more than just, [grateful], damaged feet and broken bones—for seeing that there's still a, [hopeful], person underneath all these scars.
