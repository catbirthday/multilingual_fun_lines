Scenario: A daughter-in-law discovers her late husband's former girlfriend at his grave on what would have been their tenth wedding anniversary.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Excuse me but what are you, [accusatory], doing at my husband's grave on our, [trembling], wedding anniversary?

Character 2: [defensive] I have every right.

Character 1: [bitter] You have, um, every right to stand at the, [disbelieving], grave of a married man who, well, I mean, [voice breaking], died in my arms after ten years of marriage? [laughs coldly]

Character 2: [quiet] He wasn't just, um, your husband, he was, [pained], the love of my life for three years before you even, well, knew he existed. [sighs]

Character 1: [stunned] Three years before we met would make you his, [calculating], college girlfriend that he never once mentioned in our entire marriage.

Character 2: [cherishing] He mentioned me every time he played that, [soft], old jazz album or ordered whiskey neat instead of, [nostalgic], beer like you preferred.

Character 1: [angry] Don't you dare pretend you knew him, [incredulous], better than his own wife. [scoffs]

Character 2: I knew the version of him that, [wistful], stayed up painting until dawn before he traded art for, [resigned], accounting to afford your dream house. [pause]

Character 1: [wavering] He, well, um, he never painted.

Character 2: [gentle] He did though, um, every Sunday morning before you woke up, I mean, [revealing], storing the canvases in his office behind, [tender], tax files where you'd never look. [sighs]

Character 1: [discovering] There were canvases in his office when we, [shaken], cleared it out but I thought they were, [confused], blank. [trails off]

Character 2: [knowing] Turn them around, um, and you'll find, [emotional], thirty-seven portraits of the same subject.

Character 1: Well, um, I suppose you're going to, [defensive], tell me they're all of you from, I mean, [sarcastic], your grand romance that somehow, er, [wounded], nobody knew about.

Character 2: [sad] No, um, they're all of you but painted with the, [aching], technique I taught him during those, well, [bittersweet], three years when we thought we'd have forever to, you know, [breaking], perfect it.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] He painted me using methods you, [crumbling], taught him while loving me with a heart you, [understanding], helped him learn to, [whispered], open.

Character 2: [tearful] We both loved him.

Character 1: I'm starting to, um, understand that maybe, [accepting], we both still do. [softly]

Character 2: [hopeful] Maybe we could, well, share stories about the, [warm], parts of him we each knew, um, [reaching out], help each other understand the, [cherishing], whole man we both lost. [sighs deeply]

Character 1: [resolving] I brought two roses today thinking, well, one for each decade but maybe, [offering], one should be from you for those, um, [acknowledging], three years that made him who he became. [pause]

Character 2: [grateful] That would mean everything because, um, I've been coming here, [confessing], alone for two years with nowhere to, well, [relieved], put my grief. [crying softly]
