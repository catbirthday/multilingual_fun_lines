Scenario: An ATV mechanic arrives at a luxury estate to repair a broken vehicle, only to discover the woman who called for service is his high school sweetheart who disappeared without explanation ten years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: The call said something about a, [stunned], broken Polaris RZR but I didn't expect to be driving up to a, [uncomfortable], place like this, or to see, [voice dropping], you standing here after all these years, Rebecca.

Character 2: [frozen] I didn't, um, realize you were still working at, [shaking], well, at your dad's shop, I mean, or that you'd be the one they'd, [barely breathing], send out here today.

Character 1: Ten years without a single, [bitter], word and now you're calling my shop because your, [incredulous], rich boyfriend's toy needs fixing like none of that, [hurt], history between us ever happened. [exhales hard]

Character 2: [whispered] Um, I know.

Character 1: [tense] You disappeared three days before our wedding, [voice cracking], left nothing but a note saying you couldn't explain, and now here you are in this, [gesturing wildly], marble driveway wearing diamonds bigger than anything I could've ever afforded.

Character 2: [defensive] Well, um, you don't understand what I, [trembling], had to do or, I mean, why I had to leave everything behind. [long pause]

Character 1: Maybe I don't understand but I spent two years, [raw], wondering if you were even alive while you were apparently being kept in luxury.

Character 2: [pleading] Being kept isn't the, [breaking], freedom you think it is, Danny.

Character 1: [softer] The ATV's carburetor is probably just, [professional], clogged but I can't pretend this is just another service call. [sighs heavily]

Character 2: [desperate] I tried to call you, um, so many times but he monitors, [whispering], everything, I mean, every call, every text, every movement I make.

Character 1: [shocked] Wait, are you saying you're not here by, [growing angry], choice, that this whole setup is some kind of, [horrified], prison with Italian marble and, [disgusted], infinity pools?

Character 2: [urgent] He'll be back from his business trip in, [panicking], three hours and if he finds out I called you specifically instead of the, [frantic], regular mechanic he uses, I don't know what he'll, [terrified], do to either of us. [voice breaking]

Character 1: [determined] Then we need to, um, figure this out fast because I'm not, [fierce], leaving you here if you're in danger, not again, not after I already, [regretful], lost you once, well, I mean, not without knowing the truth.

Character 2: The truth is that, um, my father owed him money, [hollow], more money than you can imagine, and I was the, [disgusted], payment he accepted to clear the debt, so, well, here I am, [defeated], ten years later.

Character 1: Your dad sold you to cover his, [furious], gambling debts and you just, um, went along with it instead of, well, coming to me for help? [voice rising]

Character 2: [crying softly] Um, he said he'd, well, kill you.

Character 1: [resolved] Pack whatever you can fit in my truck because we're, [determined], leaving right now and heading straight to my cousin who's a, [steady], state trooper three towns over.

Character 2: [hopeful] You'd really risk everything to, [overwhelmed], help me after what I put you through?

Character 1: [sincere] I never stopped loving you, Rebecca, not through the, [emotional], anger or the confusion or even when I tried dating other people who could never, [soft], measure up to what we had before everything went to, [bitter], hell that night.

Character 2: [sobbing] I've been dead inside for so long that I, [grateful], forgot what it felt like to have someone actually care whether I, [breaking down], lived or died. [cries quietly]
