Scenario: An intelligence analyst meets with their former colleague, now an environmental engineer, after discovering their classified research on climate-induced migration patterns was used to justify a covert military operation that resulted in civilian casualties.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hollow] The satellite images you analyzed three years ago are, [breaking], covered in blood now—seventeen dead civilians in Yemen.

Character 2: I was studying, um, [horrified], drought patterns and population movements for, like, [trembling], academic research, not for whatever you people turned it into, I mean.

Character 1: [bitter] You knew who was funding the research when you, [accusatory], signed those NDAs and took the clearance, don't pretend you were, [disgusted], some innocent academic.

Character 2: [defensive] Well, um, I thought we were preventing humanitarian crises, not, [voice cracking], creating them, you know?

Character 1: Prevention meant identifying where people would flee when, um, [clinical], water sources dried up so we could, well, [trailing off], intercept potential security threats before they reached allied borders, I mean.

Character 2: Those were families looking for, [shaking], water, not terrorists planning attacks, and you, [furious], used my environmental models to hunt them down.

Character 1: [exhausted] Look, er, once the data leaves your desk it becomes, like, [resigned], intelligence product and you know, [heavy], we don't get to choose how command uses it, anyway.

Character 2: That's exactly why I, [contemptuous], left—because none of you question what happens after the briefing ends.

Character 1: So, um, you ran away to study coral reefs and, well, [mocking], pretend your hands are clean while we're still, er, [bitter], dealing with the consequences of your predictions.

Character 2: [wounded] At least I'm trying to, [determined], save something instead of destroying it.

Character 1: [quiet] The models you created are still being used, they're, [hesitant], too accurate to abandon, and more operations are, [haunted], planned for next month.

Character 2: [desperate] Then you have to, um, stop them somehow, or like, [pleading], leak it, do something, anything before more people, I mean, before more children die.

Character 1: You think I haven't, umm, [tormented], considered that every single night since the strike reports came in, but like, [broken], whistleblowing means prison and I have, well, [defeated], a daughter with leukemia who needs my insurance, you know?

Character 2: [soft] Sarah's sick? Why didn't you, um, [pained], tell me, I mean, we used to be, like, [nostalgic], friends before all this madness started.

Character 1: We stopped being friends when you, well, [raw], published that paper condemning the intelligence community without ever, like, [accusing], naming names or taking real responsibility for what you, um, [spiteful], helped build.

Character 2: I tried to warn people without, er, [guilty], violating my agreements, but you're right, I mean, I was a coward.

Character 1: [firm] Just tell me one thing—if you could go back, would you still, um, [searching], give us that research?

Character 2: [immediate] Never. [long pause]

Character 1: [weary] Then you're a better person than me because I'd, [ashamed], do it again if it meant keeping Sarah's treatments going, even knowing what I, [broken], know now.

Character 2: That's not being worse, it's just being, [understanding], human in an inhuman system that forces us to choose between, [gentle], impossible options. [sighs deeply]
