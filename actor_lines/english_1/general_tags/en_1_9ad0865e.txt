Scenario: After losing their job, home, and family in the same month, someone finally calls the crisis hotline they've been staring at for three days.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shakily] I've been staring at your number for three days, just sitting here with the phone in my hand, and I don't even know what to say now that someone actually answered.

Character 2: [gently] That took a lot of courage to finally dial, and I'm really glad you did. There's no wrong way to start this conversation—sometimes just being on the line together is enough. [pause]

Character 1: [voice cracking] Everything's gone—my job, my apartment, even my dog had to go to my ex because I can't afford food for him anymore.

Character 2: [steadying] Those are devastating losses, all of them hitting at once like that. When did you last eat something, even just a piece of bread or some water?

Character 1: Yesterday, I think.

Character 2: [concerned but calm] Okay, we need to address that soon, but right now I'm here with you. You mentioned your ex—are you completely alone right now, or is there anyone nearby?

Character 1: [bitter laugh] I'm in my car in a Walmart parking lot because it's the only place with lights that doesn't chase you away. This is what rock bottom looks like, apparently. [sniffles]

Character 2: You're surviving, and that matters more than you might realize right now. That Walmart parking lot is keeping you safe tonight, and calling us was a choice to keep going. [softer] What's your first name?

Character 1: [hesitant] It's Jamie. [exhales] I used to be somebody, you know? Had a whole life, a five-year plan, people who returned my calls.

Character 2: Jamie, you're still somebody—you're someone who's fighting through the hardest thing imaginable and still reaching out for connection. The life you had doesn't define your worth. [pause]

Character 1: [trembling] I keep thinking about how easy it would be to just... not wake up tomorrow. [quieter] That's why I finally called.

Character 2: Thank you for telling me that, Jamie—it helps me understand where you are right now. Have you thought about specific ways to hurt yourself, or is it more like wanting the pain to stop?

Character 1: [exhausted] Both? Neither? [sighs] I had a whole plan yesterday, but then I remembered my mom would have to identify my body and I couldn't do that to her.

Character 2: Your mom—she doesn't know where you are right now? Sometimes the people who love us most don't know how to help, but that doesn't mean they don't want to.

Character 1: [defensive] She thinks I'm staying with friends while I 'figure things out.' [voice breaking] How do you tell your mother you're sleeping in a Toyota Corolla and showering at the gym until your membership expires next week?

Character 2: [compassionate] Pride is such a heavy thing to carry when you're already holding so much pain. Jamie, there's a warming center about two miles from that Walmart—they serve hot meals and have counselors on site.

Character 1: [weakly] I drove past it earlier but there were so many people outside and I just... I used to donate to places like that. [hollow laugh]

Character 2: Life has a way of humbling us all eventually, and accepting help doesn't erase the good you've done. [gently] Can we make a small agreement? Just for tonight—you'll go get one hot meal?

Character 1: [long pause] Maybe. [sniffles] I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm dissolving, like every day takes another piece of who I used to be.

Character 2: [warmly] You're not dissolving, Jamie—you're transforming, even though it feels like breaking right now. And I'll stay on this line with you as long as you need, whether that's five minutes or five hours. [reassuring] You don't have to do this alone tonight.
