Scenario: A former basketball player encounters the sports announcer who narrated his career-ending breakdown on live television five years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [steady] Marcus Chen. I, uh, wasn't sure you'd remember my face after five years, but the way you just froze tells me you do.

Character 2: Of course I remember—I called your final game, the one where you, um, well, where everything fell apart on national television. [clears throat] That's not exactly something a broadcaster forgets.

Character 1: You called it 'the most spectacular self-destruction in playoff history,' I believe. [dry laugh] Very poetic for someone narrating a man losing everything in real-time.

Character 2: [defensive] Look, I was doing my job, calling what I saw—the missed shots, the technical fouls, the, uh, the way you just completely unraveled out there.

Character 1: [quieter] You know what's funny? I actually listened to your broadcast later, during rehab, and you were so... clinical about watching me implode. Like you were describing weather patterns, not someone's life collapsing.

Character 2: [shifting uncomfortably] What was I supposed to do, stop calling the game? Pretend you weren't throwing punches at your own teammates? The camera was on, millions were watching, I had to—

Character 1: [cutting in] Had to what, exactly? Because I've heard announcers show compassion before, acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, they're watching someone have a mental breakdown, not just 'poor sportsmanship.'

Character 2: You're right. I mean, Christ, you're absolutely right. I was so focused on being professional that I forgot there was a human being melting down twenty feet from my booth.

Character 1: Twenty-two feet, actually. [bitter smile] I know because I've been back to that arena seventeen times since getting sober, measuring distances, trying to understand the geometry of my worst day.

Character 2: [stunned] Seventeen times? That's... Jesus, that's some kind of self-torture, isn't it? Going back to relive all that?

Character 1: [firmly] No, it's the opposite. Each visit I reclaim a little more of myself from that night, from your voice echoing through the speakers calling my disgrace.

Character 2: [voice dropping] You know what I never said on air? That I recognized the look in your eyes because, um, because I'd seen it in the mirror after my father died.

Character 1: What?

Character 2: [pushing through] Yeah, that hollow, desperate look of someone who's grieving but can't stop moving, can't stop performing. Your mother had just died, hadn't she? Three days before that game.

Character 1: [voice catching] The team knew, the league knew, but nobody... we don't talk about that stuff, we just play through it, and I thought I could just—[exhales shakily]

Character 2: I should have said something on air, acknowledged it somehow. Instead I just kept calling plays like you were a machine that had broken down, not a person who was grieving.

Character 1: [softer] Well, you're acknowledging it now, aren't you? Five years late, but, I mean, time doesn't really fix things anyway, it just makes them easier to look at.

Character 2: [earnest] For what it's worth, I've never called a game the same way since. I try to remember there are people inside those uniforms, people with, you know, whole lives happening off the court.

Character 1: That's something, I guess. Maybe next time someone falls apart in front of you, your voice won't be the thing haunting them through recovery. [pause] Maybe it'll even help.

Character 2: [quietly grateful] Marcus, I—thank you for saying that. And for, uh, for not throwing a punch when you saw me just now, honestly. [nervous laugh]
