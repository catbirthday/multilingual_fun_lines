Scenario: A corporate investigator confronts a grandfather whose deceased son's company is under investigation for embezzlement, requiring the grandfather to answer for financial documents he unknowingly signed as a board member.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Your signature appears on, [cold], seventeen different financial documents authorizing transfers that ultimately funded terrorist operations in three countries.

Character 2: [trembling] I don't, um, I mean I don't understand what you're, [confused], saying because my son, well, he told me those were just routine paperwork for the company.

Character 1: [harsh] Your son has been dead for, [tactless], six months and these transactions continued for three months, [accusatory], after his funeral. [pause]

Character 2: [defensive] My daughter-in-law brought me, [shaking], papers to sign because she said the company needed, [desperate], continuity and I trusted her because she was, [breaking], family.

Character 1: [unmoved] Trust doesn't absolve you from, [stern], legal responsibility when your negligence enabled, [disgusted], money laundering on this scale regardless of your, [dismissive], supposed ignorance.

Character 2: [angry] I'm seventy-eight years old and I was, [grief-stricken], mourning my only child while trying to, [exhausted], help his widow keep the business afloat that he spent, [bitter], twenty years building.

Character 1: [relentless] The victims of the bombings funded by, [clinical], your signatures don't care about your, [cutting], grief or your age.

Character 2: [pleading] Those were supposed to be, [desperate], construction contracts for schools and hospitals in developing nations which is what, [broken], my son always believed in and what he, [choked], dedicated his life to.

Character 1: [skeptical] Yet you never once questioned why, [incredulous], a construction company needed offshore accounts in, [sharp], twelve different countries. [scoffs]

Character 2: My son built, [proud], schools for refugee children, and I mean, I thought, um, well, the accounts were for managing international projects.

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, um, I mean, your willful blindness, [harsh], doesn't change the fact that, er, you're now facing, [grave], federal charges that could mean dying in prison. [sighs heavily]

Character 2: [defeated] Well, um, I suppose that's, [hollow], fitting since I've been dead inside, anyway, since the day we buried him.

Character 1: That's not going to, [unmoved], work as a defense strategy in court.

Character 2: [resolute] I'm not looking for, [steady], a defense strategy anymore.

Character 1: [surprised] Then what exactly are you, [curious], looking for here? [pause]

Character 2: [quiet] Um, I guess, I mean, just someone to, [broken], tell me if my son knew what was really happening, well, before he died.

Character 1: [softer] The evidence suggests he discovered the truth, [careful], three days before his car accident. [long pause]

Character 2: [anguished] So they killed him because he was going to, [understanding], expose them and then used his grieving father to, [bitter], continue their operations. [cries softly]

Character 1: [conflicted] Look, I shouldn't, um, be telling you this, but, well, [reluctant], we found a flash drive hidden in his office with, [quieter], evidence he was gathering.

Character 2: [hopeful] Then he was trying to, [proud], do the right thing before they, [breaking], stopped him. [whispers]
