It's showing as transaction TXN-9847-VK2 from yesterday at 3:47 PM for exactly two hundred dollars, and it looks like it was processed through... hmm, let me check the merchant code here."

So actually, um, when I dig deeper into vendor ID VND-88291-TM, they're listed as a medical equipment supplier, not telecom—that merchant code was miscategorized. They sell like phlebotomy supplies, centrifuges, that kind of... but you're saying you didn't authorize this purchase?"

So here's what I can do right away—I'm gonna flag this transaction with dispute code DSP-1122-PRIORITY and, uh, freeze any pending charges from that vendor. The thing is though... since it already posted, we'll need to file a formal dispute, which typically takes like three to five business days to resolve."

And actually what I'll do is—I'm generating a provisional credit authorization PCA-7739-TEMP right now, so basically the two hundred dollars will be credited back while we investigate, and that should show up by... let me check... tomorrow morning by 6 AM Eastern."

            "content": "Yeah so, er, I could block the entire card with security code SEC-FULL-BLOCK, but then you wouldn't be able to use it for anything until the replacement arrives. Or—and this might work better—I can do a selective merchant block just for vendor VND-88291-TM specifically, which means your card still works everywhere else but they can't charge you again."

Oh and just so you know, um, I'm also adding a fraud alert flag FAF-HIGH to your account, which basically means we'll text you for any charge over fifty dollars for the next thirty days, just to be extra safe."

You'll get confirmation text to your number ending in 8827, and er, is there anything else I can help you with today? I know this was stressful but we've got everything protected now."
