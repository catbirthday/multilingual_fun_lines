Scenario: assistant coach, deferential at first but building courage to push back on a denied expense

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, so I'm, uh... let me see here... I submitted an expense for, um, team equipment?

Customer Support: Oh I can definitely help you with that, and I think we can get this sorted out for you, so let me just pull up your account here and, um, what's your employee ID number?

Customer: It's, uh, 4-4-7... wait, hmm, why do you need that if... okay it's 44782.

Customer Support: Perfect, thank you so much, so I'm seeing here your expense report EXP-77263-QM for athletic equipment that was, I think it was submitted last Tuesday, and it looks like it was marked as denied.

Customer: Right but, um... hmm, how do I know this is even, er, legitimate? Like who decided this?

Customer Support: That's a really fair question, and I totally understand your concern here, so what I'm seeing is that it was flagged by our automated system under policy code POL-8847-A, which I think relates to pre-approval requirements for purchases over a certain amount.

Customer: Um, but I've done this before... let me think... uh, this is exactly what we always order, so...

Customer Support: You know what, I believe you completely, and sometimes these systems can be a bit rigid, so let me, um, dig a little deeper here into your purchase history under account ACC-55921-K to see what's different this time.

Customer: Okay so, uh, wait... are you saying I did something wrong? Because, um, I followed the same process...

Customer Support: No no no, not at all, you did everything right, and actually, between you and me, I think I see what happened here - the threshold for automatic approval probably got lowered from $500 to $400 last month.

Customer: That's... hmm, nobody told us that. Er, how do I even know that's true?

Customer Support: I completely get why you'd be skeptical, and honestly I kind of appreciate that you're being careful here, so what I can do is send you the policy update memo MEM-38847-C that went out, though I think it might have only gone to department heads.

Customer: Um, okay but... so that means... uh, wait, the kids need this equipment by, er, next week.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely, we're going to fix this right now, and I'm going to, um, sort of bypass the normal channels here if that's okay with you, using override code OVR-92736-X to get this approved today.

Customer: You can just... hmm, you can do that? Like, uh, how do I know this won't happen again?

Customer Support: So here's what I'm doing, and this is kind of our little secret, but I'm adding a note to your profile PRF-44782-AA that basically pre-clears you for equipment purchases up to $600, which should probably cover you for the whole season.

Customer: Oh. Um... okay that's... er, that's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Customer Support: You're so welcome, and I think everything should process within about 24 hours with confirmation number CNF-88429-KL, but just in case anything weird happens, you can reference this call with ticket number TKT-20847-B.

Customer: Right, um, I'll write those down... hmm, next time should I just, uh, call first or...?

Customer Support: Honestly, I'd say maybe just shoot us a quick email to verify before any purchase over $400, reference this override code I gave you, and that way you won't have to deal with this again, which I know is probably really frustrating when you're just trying to help the team.
