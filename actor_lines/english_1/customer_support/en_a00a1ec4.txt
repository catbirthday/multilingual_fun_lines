Scenario: substitute teacher, confused about which payroll system she should contact about missing wages

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I'm so sorry to, uh... hmm, let me see here... I know this isn't your fault but I'm just... confused.

Customer Support: Oh no worries at all, um, I'm here to help and we'll, uh, we'll definitely get this sorted out for you today, okay? So let me just pull up—sorry, I mean, let me get your account here. Can you give me your employee ID or social security number?

Customer: Okay so um... hmm, what if... I don't actually know my employee ID?

Customer Support: That's totally fine, um, happens all the time actually, so let's just use your social, uh, whenever you're ready, and I'll look you up in our system that way.

Customer: It's um... 523... wait, hmm... 523-67-8901.

Customer Support: Perfect, um, okay so I'm seeing here—oh wait, actually there's—sorry, let me correct myself, there's actually two different profiles under your social. One shows payroll code PAY-8827-SD for the main district system and, uh, another one that's, hmm, SUB-4451-TC for substitute teachers specifically.

Customer: Oh. Um. That's... hmm, okay so that means... I have two?

Customer Support: Yes exactly, and um, you know what? This is actually really common with substitute teachers, so don't worry, we're going to figure out which one has your missing wages. Let me just, uh, check both systems here, reference number REF-7739-KL for the first one...

Customer: I'm sorry you have to... deal with this mess.

Customer Support: Oh please, um, honestly this is, uh, this is nothing compared to some of the tangles I've seen today, and you're being so patient which I really appreciate. So in the main system I can see, um, let me—sorry, Tuesday, no wait, Wednesday you worked at Lincoln Elementary?

Customer: Um, yes but... hmm, let me see here... also Monday. At Jefferson.

Customer Support: Right right, um, okay so I'm seeing Monday now too under transaction TXN-9054-MP, and uh, here's what I think happened—the Monday one went to the main payroll but Wednesday's in the substitute system entirely.

Customer: So I need to... hmm... contact both?

Customer Support: Well, um, actually no, here's the good news—I can, uh, I can merge these for you right now if you want? Your case number would be CSE-2281-QR and basically, um, everything would go through just the one system going forward, which should make things way easier.

Customer: Oh. Um. That would be... yes. Please.

Customer Support: Okay perfect, so I'm, uh, I'm doing that now and—hmm, it's asking me to verify—sorry, which direct deposit account should I use, the one ending in 4429 or 7801?

Customer: Um... hmm, what if I... 4429. That one.

Customer Support: Got it, um, processing now with confirmation CNF-3365-BB, and you know what? I can also see, uh, there's actually $487.50 that's been sitting in limbo between the two systems, so that'll be released to you within, hmm, 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Really? I just... thank you. So tired of calling.

Customer Support: I completely understand, and um, you shouldn't have to call again about this. Everything's under reference number REF-1120-ZK now, and uh, if you do need anything else, just give them that number and they'll see the whole history. You should be all set now.
