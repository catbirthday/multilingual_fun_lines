Scenario: fence installer, caught in the middle of a neighbor dispute that's affecting his invoice

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Oh great, um, so I've got a real fun situation here with an invoice that's, uh, basically being held hostage by feuding neighbors.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, let me just... pull up your account here and, uh, that's definitely... not something I hear every day... What's your order number if you have it?

Customer: FNC-4491-BB2. Install was Tuesday but neither neighbor will sign off because they're, um, apparently in some kind of property line war.

Customer Support: Right so, uh, I've got FNC-4491-BB2 here and I can see the, um... the install is marked as pending completion... which is... hmm... Let me check the notes because that's...

Customer: Yeah, pending. Forever pending. I literally installed a fence through, er, what might be a divorce? I don't even know anymore.

Customer Support: Oh that's... I mean, um, according to what I'm seeing here in ticket TKT-88429-X, you need, uh, both property owners to sign the completion form? And neither one will...

Customer: Bingo. Mrs. Henderson says it's two inches on her side, Mr. Henderson says, um, it's exactly where he wanted it, and I'm just...

Customer Support: That's really, um, putting you in a tough spot. So, uh, normally I'd just... but with dispute code DSP-7764 attached, I can't, er, release the payment until...

Customer: Until what, world peace? Um, look, I installed exactly where the survey marks showed, like, I've got photos and everything.

Customer Support: No no, I totally get it. Let me, um, see what options... Hmm, there's this escalation path EXC-3399-L but it needs, uh, third party verification which...

Customer: Which sounds expensive and, uh, time-consuming and honestly? I just want to get paid for the fence I already built, you know?

Customer Support: Right right. I really, um, wish I could just... override this but the system won't... Hold on though, what if we, uh, reclassify this under provision code PRV-6622-M?

Customer: Is that, um, is that actually a thing or are you just making up numbers to make me feel better?

Customer Support: No it's, uh, it's real! See, if we mark it as a, um, partial completion with documented dispute... not between you and them but between them... that might actually...

Customer: Oh so like, I'm not the problem, they're each other's problem? That's, er, that's actually pretty accurate.

Customer Support: Exactly! Um, let me just, uh, try to... okay so under case file CSE-9983-QR2, I'm adding your documentation and... hmm, it's asking for a supervisor approval but...

Customer: But nothing ever gets approved on Fridays, right? That's how this always goes.

Customer Support: Well, um, actually my supervisor is... she's pretty good about these and, uh, especially with verification photos... Can you email those to disputes@fencing with reference REF-7724-NK9?

Customer: Already sending them. Um, you've been weirdly helpful for someone who kept saying they couldn't help. Like, thanks for actually trying here.

Customer Support: I mean, um, I hate when people get stuck because of... stuff that's not even their fault, you know? Check back Monday, uh, with ticket TKT-88429-X and it should be... fingers crossed... resolved.
