Scenario: confused about pro-rated charges after plan change

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Hmm, so what's... let me see here... Got weird charge? Don't get it.

Customer Support: So basically. Um. I see you're calling about. Your account ending in 7734. So like, you recently changed plans and. Um. There's a charge showing as PRO-847-M for thirty-two seventeen. Right?

Customer: Yeah. Exactly. That.

Customer Support: Okay so. Here's what happened. And like. This is super common. When you switched from basic to premium on the fifteenth. So basically. The system pro-rates. Um. Both ways.

Customer: Um, okay so that means... wait, both? Hmm, don't... don't get that part.

Customer Support: Right right. So like, um, you get credited for unused basic days, that's credit line CRD-4429-PK, and then, uh, charged for premium days, which is, so, transaction TXN-88561-QV2, and basically they, um, they just show weird.

Customer: Let me think... so I paid twice? Or... hmm, what if I just... no wait.

Customer Support: No no. Not twice. So basically, um, like, you paid once but. The invoice INV-7829-RT. Shows it split. Because accounting. Um. Yeah I know. It's ridiculous how they display it.

Customer: Uh, okay so... hmm... that's kinda... gettin' it now. Maybe.

Customer Support: Look. Between you and me? The way they show pro-rated charges. It's. Um. Confusing as hell. Even I had to, like, double-check your statement STM-9902-AA twice.

Customer: Um, yeah, see that's... hmm, least you're honest 'bout it, uh, thanks.

Customer Support: So like. The actual math. Um. Pretty simple. You had ten days left on basic at two ninety-nine daily. So that's credit of, uh, twenty-nine ninety on line item LI-4857-K.

Customer: Okay so, um, wait... lemme see here... ten days, yeah, uh-huh.

Customer Support: Then. Premium costs four ninety-nine daily. So. Um. Ten days is forty-nine ninety. Transaction code TXN-91847-ZM3. Basically you're paying. Like. The twenty dollar difference.

Customer: Ohhhh. Hmm, okay so that means, uh, net twenty. Got it. Think I get it.

Customer Support: Exactly. So like, um, your next bill cycle BLL-2847-PP on the first? That'll be. Just. Normal premium. No weird splits.

Customer: Um, good, 'cause this was... hmm, real confusin'. Let me see... yeah, makes sense now.

Customer Support: Yeah so. I'm gonna, um, email you a breakdown. Reference number REF-77492-QQT. And like. If you want. I can add a note to, uh, clean up how they display this next time.

Customer: Uh, yeah, that'd... hmm, that'd actually help lots, thanks.

Customer Support: Done. Added note NTE-8847-VX to your account. So basically. Um. Anything else about the charges? Or. We good?
