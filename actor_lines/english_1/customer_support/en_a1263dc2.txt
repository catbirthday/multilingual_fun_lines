Scenario: frustrated because the automated system kept misunderstanding them

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So basically, um, your robot kept... hmm, let me think... it kept hearing "billing" when I said "shipping."

Customer Support: Huh. That's weird. Let me just—actually wait—pull up your account here. What's your order number?

Customer: I don't... um, so like, I never got that far? It just kept looping.

Customer Support: Got it got it. So no worries, I can look you up by phone. Okay so... that's account ACC-7742-NX91. Now. The automated system. It kept mishearing you?

Customer: Precisely. So, um, forty-seven minutes. Of this.

Customer Support: Forty-sev—wow. That's. Um. That's completely unacceptable actually. Let me check the call logs here for reference RLG-882561-P and... oh. Oh this is interesting.

Customer: Hmm, so basically I'm probably just... like, not speaking clearly enough?

Customer Support: No no no. This isn't on you. System flagged seventeen failed routing attempts under session ID SES-9947-KL22M. That's. The system should've transferred you after three. Maximum.

Customer: So um, what if I just... hmm... spoke more slowly next time?

Customer Support: Absolutely not. You shouldn't have to—look. Case number CSE-445892-YN. I'm escalating this. We're fixing this pattern recognition issue.

Customer: It's fine. Really. So like, I mean, I probably mumble.

Customer Support: Nope. Stop that. Your audio quality score was 94.7% according to metric report MET-7736-QD. The system's voice model is just. Broken. For certain accent patterns.

Customer: Oh. So basically it's... um, it's actually not me?

Customer Support: Right right.

Customer: Hmm, okay so, um, can you just... like, help me track my package then?

Customer Support: Already on it. So your tracking number is TRK-998427-BN55X and, um, here's what's weird—it says delivered yesterday? But you're calling about shipping so I'm thinking. Wrong address maybe?

Customer: Wait. Um. Let me check... so basically, oh god, my old address.

Customer Support: There it is. Mystery solved. Delivery confirmation DCF-7749-PL shows 1847 Pine Street not 1874. The automated system probably would've caught this. If it had actually. You know. Worked.

Customer: So I'm just... hmm... completely out of luck then?

Customer Support: Nah. We're gonna fix this. Recovery ticket RCV-332415-MD opened. Expedited reshipment. Should have tracking number TRK-998428-BN56X within the hour. And your automation complaint? That's going straight to engineering.
