=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So um, I got this email? About, uh... what's the word... price adjustments? Automatic ones?

Customer Support: Oh yeah, um, those are actually, uh, pretty cool. Let me just, er, pull up your account here real quick. What's your, um, email?

Customer: It's j.martin at, um, techflow dot com. But like, I don't... I don't get it?

Customer Support: Perfect, got it. So, um, between you and me? This is actually, uh, one of the better features we have. Your account ID ACC-7823-MX shows you're, er, enrolled in our price protection program.

Customer: Price protection? Wait I didn't... what's that... how does that work exactly?

Customer Support: Okay so, um, basically, uh, whenever an item you bought drops in price within, er, thirty days? We automatically, um, credit you the difference to your account balance BAL-9902-KJ.

Customer: Wait, really? That's... that's automatic? Like I don't have to do anything?

Customer Support: Um, yeah, totally automatic. So like, uh, here's the fun part - you bought that monitor on October 2nd, order ORD-4451-ZN, and, er, it dropped fifty bucks yesterday.

Customer: Fifty bucks? Um, so that just... what's the term... credits back? Automatically?

Customer Support: Yep. Um, and, uh, don't tell anyone but I can actually, er, extend your protection window from thirty to, um, sixty days if you want. Code EPW-6677-DX.

Customer: Wait you can DO that? That's... um... that's amazing! Really?

Customer Support: Mmmm, let me just... focus here... updating... your terms...

Customer: So like, um, every purchase? Or just... what's covered... certain things?

Customer Support: Okay so, um, electronics over fifty dollars, home goods over, uh, seventy-five. Your purchase history shows, er, twelve eligible items under tracking code TRK-3389-PP.

Customer: Twelve items? I had no... um... no idea this was happening!

Customer Support: Um, yeah so, uh, you've actually gotten, er, let me calculate... one hundred forty-two dollars back since June. Transaction log TXN-8821-QV shows all the, um, adjustments.

Customer: A hundred and... wait REALLY? That's like... um... free money basically?

Customer Support: Right? So, um, between us? Most people never, uh, notice these credits. But you're all set now with, er, the extended window. Reference number REF-2234-TL for your records.

Customer: This is wild! Um, so it just... keeps happening? Forever?

Customer Support: Um, yeah, as long as you're, uh, an active member. Your membership MBR-5567-JK renews annually and, er, the price protection is included. Pretty sweet deal, honestly.
