Scenario: wanting to update their shipping address for an order already in transit

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So basically, um, I need to change where my package is going? Like, it's supposed to go to my old place but I just moved.

Customer Support: Okaaay, let me pull that up for you. What's your order number?

Customer: I think it's... probably something with a seven? Maybe 7783?

Customer Support: Alright so, um, I'm gonna need the full number but, uh, let me just—wait, did you say you moved? Like recently? Because, um, here's the thing between you and me, if it's already shipped we might have a little, er, situation.

Customer: Wait, so you're saying... it can't go to my new address? Even though it's still being delivered?

Customer Support: So your order—sorry, I need that order number first to check where exactly—but typically once it's with the carrier, I mean...

Customer: Oh, um, let me check my email... so it's like, ORD-8856-QM? Or maybe QN?

Customer Support: ORD-8856-QM, got it, perfect. Yeah so, um, this one left our facility yesterday at, uh, 3:47 PM, tracking number TRK-99283847-US, and it's, hmm, currently in transit through Memphis.

Customer: Memphis? But I thought—wait, isn't it coming from California? That seems backwards.

Customer Support: No no, that's—sorry, that's normal routing. Goes through the hub. But listen, here's what we can do, and this is, um, kind of a workaround...

Customer: So basically, um, you're saying there's like, a way to fix this? I'm sort of confused about what happens next.

Customer Support: Right, so technically—and I mean technically—once it's shipped, address changes aren't, uh, supposed to happen. Policy says no changes after dispatch confirmation DPC-7739-A.

Customer: But you just said there's a workaround? So can it go to my new place or not?

Customer Support: Okay so, um, what I can do—and like, don't spread this around—I can, uh, attempt what we call an intercept request, code INT-5542. Sometimes it works, sometimes the package is too far along, but um, worth a shot, right?

Customer: I think—no wait, actually—so if this intercept thing works, it definitely goes to my new address?

Customer Support: If it works, yes. New address, no prob. But—and here's where I gotta be straight with you—success rate's about 60% once it hits sorting facility SOF-22.

Customer: Sixty percent? That's like... so basically, um, there's a pretty good chance it still goes to the old place?

Customer Support: Yeah, so, um, that's why I'm also gonna, uh, set you up with a backup plan here. If the intercept fails—sorry, when the intercept—I mean if, if it fails, you'll get notification code NTF-888234 and we'll overnight a replacement.

Customer: Oh, um, so I might get two packages? One at each place? That's sort of... I mean, I guess that works?

Customer Support: Exactly, and um, here's the fun part—you keep both if that happens. Order credit OC-7792-B already applied just in case. So like, worst case? You get double. Between you and me? Not a bad deal.
