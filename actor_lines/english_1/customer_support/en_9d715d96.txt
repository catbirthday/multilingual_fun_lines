Scenario: wedding cake designer, stressed about getting a flour supplier refund during peak season

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I think I need... probably need help with a refund?

Customer Support: Oh. Okay. Um. So basically I can definitely help with that. Let me just. Pull up your account here. Can you give me your order number or. Like. Your phone number associated with the account?

Customer: It's, uh, maybe under... sort of under Bella's Cakes?

Customer Support: Perfect. So. I'm seeing account ACC-4829-BC here and. Um. Basically there's a pending refund request for. Like. Flour order FLR-98271-X from last Tuesday. Is that. Um. Is that what you're calling about?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Probably that one.

Customer Support: So, um, I'm really sorry but. Like. The thing is. During peak season which is basically now through October. Our supplier refunds are. Um. They take fourteen business days instead of the usual three.

Customer: Wait, fourteen? But I sort of need...

Customer Support: I know. I'm so sorry. It's. Um. Like basically the policy during wedding season is. Really strict. But let me. Hmm. Actually wait. Your order FLR-98271-X shows. Um. Premium account status?

Customer: Um, maybe? I think I might've signed up?

Customer Support: Oh! Okay so. This changes things. Premium accounts get. Um. Expedited processing even during peak. So basically instead of fourteen days. You're looking at. Like. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours maximum.

Customer: Wait, really? That's... um, that's actually perfect!

Customer Support: Yeah! And. Um. So actually looking at the timestamp here. Transaction TXN-55289-QM was initiated Tuesday at 2PM. Which means. Like. You should see it by tomorrow afternoon latest.

Customer: Oh wow, I'm, uh, sorry, I just... I'm kind of stressed.

Customer Support: No no! Don't apologize. I. Um. I actually used to work at a bakery before this. Like. Wedding season is absolutely insane. The flour orders alone are. Just. Nightmare territory.

Customer: Um, yeah, exactly! Three weddings this weekend probably.

Customer Support: Three?! Oh man. So basically you need every refund hitting your account ASAP. Let me. Um. Actually put a rush flag on this. Reference number REF-7263-RF. Just to be. Like. Extra sure it processes tonight.

Customer: Really? That's, um, that's really... thank you!

Customer Support: Of course! And. Um. So between you and me? If you ever have issues during peak season. Like. Call and ask for expedited review using code EXP-PEAK-23. It's. Basically. Not widely advertised but. Um. For our premium baking accounts we can usually push things through faster.

Customer: I didn't expect... um, this is really helpful actually.

Customer Support: Happy to help! Your refund confirmation is RCP-88429-K and. Um. Honestly good luck with those weddings. Like. Seriously. Three in one weekend is. That's hero level stuff right there.
