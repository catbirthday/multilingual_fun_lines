Scenario: confused about overlapping subscription periods

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi. I'm really confused about... my subscriptions are... I don't know if they're overlapping?

Customer Support: Okay okay so um let me just pull up your account here and uh I can definitely help you figure this out, what's happening is um I need your account number or email and then I can see exactly what's going on with those subscriptions.

Customer: Oh. Sure. Um... sorry, this is probably... annoying. It's j.thompson at gmail.

Customer Support: No no not annoying at all I mean I get like probably twenty of these calls a day so um let me just... okay I've got your account JTH-445892 here and uh yeah I can see I can see what you mean there's definitely some overlap happening.

Customer: I knew it wasn't just me. Sorry. You probably... deal with this system all day...

Customer Support: Oh trust me I I know this system is um it's not the most intuitive thing so what I'm seeing is you've got subscription ID SUB-7739-QK active from January fifteenth and then there's another one SUB-7740-RZ that started February first but it's it's charging you for the full month even though you already paid.

Customer: Exactly. That's... yeah. Um, I know it's not your fault, the billing system...

Customer Support: I appreciate that I really do and um honestly between you and me this this overlap thing happens way more than it should so let me just uh kind of manually fix this for you because the automated system won't catch it until your next billing cycle which would be March first.

Customer: Um, that's really nice of you. Actually... I need to mention... medical bills. This month.

Customer Support: Oh I I totally get it I mean I've been there myself actually had a similar thing last year with my mom's procedures so um let me make sure we get this sorted right now okay okay so I'm issuing refund code REF-20240215-XK9 for that overlap period.

Customer: You're... that's so kind. Really. Thank you for understanding...

Customer Support: Look it's it's the least I can do and um I'm also gonna put a note here in your account ACC-JTH-445892 that basically says to double-check any future subscription changes because once I flag it the system should should catch these things better going forward you know?

Customer: I don't want to... um, get you in trouble or anything...

Customer Support: No no you're not you're not getting me in trouble at all this is literally what I'm supposed to do it's just that most people come in guns blazing and you're being so nice about it which honestly makes my day easier so thank you for that.

Customer: Well you're human too. Just trying to... help. Um, when will the refund...?

Customer Support: Right right so um the refund with that code REF-20240215-XK9 should hit your account in uh probably three to five business days but I think realistically more like two or three and you'll get an email confirmation to that j.thompson address within the next hour.

Customer: That's perfect. Um... actually helps with the timing. The medical stuff. Sorry for oversharing...

Customer Support: Please don't don't apologize I mean we all have life happening right and um if you need anything else or if that refund doesn't show up by like Wednesday just call back and reference ticket TKT-889234-PM and whoever gets you can can check on it immediately.

Customer: You've been so... I mean really helpful. Thank you. For being real about it.

Customer Support: Hey that's that's what I'm here for and honestly calls like this where people are just decent to each other they kind of remind me why I took this job in the first place so um take care and I hope everything works out with with the medical stuff I really do.
