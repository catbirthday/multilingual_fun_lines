=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I need help. Venue cancelled. Wedding photography deposit. Er, can you check account?

Customer Support: Let me pull that up for you... okay I'm seeing account ID ACC-89234-WP here, and there's a pending refund request from October 12th that's still being processed, so...

Customer: Wait October? Um, that's three weeks. The wedding's next month. I need that money.

Customer Support: Right, I understand the urgency here... hmm, looking at case number CSE-7721-XM, the venue submitted their portion but there's a hold because the payment method shows as disputed, which means...

Customer: Disputed? No no. Uh, I never disputed. This can't be right. Check again please.

Customer Support: Actually let me dig deeper... ah okay, so transaction TRX-445-892-KL shows a $2,850 deposit that was partially refunded already—$1,200 on October 8th—and the remaining balance is what's...

Customer: Partial? Nobody told me partial. Er, where's the rest? I need all of it back.

Customer Support: I see why that's confusing... well, according to their cancellation policy document POL-8829-V2, they retain 40% for cancellations within 60 days, but let me check if there's something we can...

Customer: Forty percent? Um, but they cancelled. Not me. That's not fair, right?

Customer Support: You're absolutely right about that... hang on, I'm checking the cancellation reason code CAN-TYPE-84B and it shows "venue closure" which should trigger full refund, not partial, so this is definitely...

Customer: Okay good. Uh, so you can fix it? Today? Er, I'm booking another venue tomorrow.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: Sorry I'm just. Um, stressed. Know it's not your fault. System's probably confusing.

Customer Support: No no, I completely understand... alright, what I'm doing now is filing an expedited review under case ESC-9982-RT with priority code P1, which typically processes within 24 to 48 hours instead of the standard...

Customer: Twenty-four hours minimum? Er, that's still. Can't go faster? Supervisor maybe?

Customer Support: Mmm, actually yes... let me transfer this to our wedding services team—they have override authority for amounts over $2,500 and can release funds code RLS-IMMEDIATE-7K within 2-4 business hours if...

Customer: Oh thank god. Yes. Um, please. Whatever gets it done today.

Customer Support: Perfect, initiating that transfer now... okay confirmation number is CNF-88412-WED, and Sarah from that team will call you directly at the number ending in 3847 within the next hour to...

Customer: Sarah. Got it. Er, you've been really helpful. Sorry for the panic. Just overwhelming.

Customer Support: Oh please, don't apologize at all... weddings are stressful enough without venue issues, and honestly case WED-PRIORITY-3K should never have taken three weeks anyway—Sarah will get you sorted, and if you need anything else...
