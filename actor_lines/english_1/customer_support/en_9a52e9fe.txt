Scenario: anxious because this charge is going to overdraft their account

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So there's a charge. On my account. And it's um... it's gonna overdraft me.

Customer Support: Let me see here... pulling up your account with ID ACC-4892-TK. Hmm, I'm seeing a pending charge for $287.43 that posted this morning.

Customer: Right. Exactly. I need that. Gone. Now.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, let me just... hmm... checking the transaction details here, reference TXN-90284-XB21. This looks like it's from a subscription renewal that processes on the fifteenth of each month.

Customer: Wait no, I canceled that—sorry, I mean the other one—not this. Whatever. Just fix it.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: So basically what happens now? Like how fast can you, um, reverse this thing?

Customer Support: Right right, so typically reversals take, um, let me see... forty-eight to seventy-two hours to process back to your account. But I'm looking at your history here under case CSE-7739-MN and I can see this is urgent.

Customer: Seventy-two hours? Are you—that's Tuesday, wait no, Wednesday. Too late.

Customer Support: No no, we're going to fix this. Let me... okay so what if... I can initiate an expedited reversal with code EXP-2847-RT that should hit by end of business today.

Customer: Um, so like, basically you're saying... what's the word... guaranteed? Today?

Customer Support: Yes. Absolutely.

Customer: Because last time. Someone said that. And then... nothing.

Customer Support: I see that incident, um, from November third, ticket TKT-6621-LP. That was... hmm, that shouldn't have happened. This time I'm personally flagging it in the priority queue.

Customer: Do you know who I... forget it. Just. Make sure. This time.

Customer Support: Okay okay, so I've just, uh, submitted the expedited request, your confirmation is CNF-8834-QZ, and I'm... let me just... adding a manager override to guarantee the timeline.

Customer: So, um, if this doesn't post, like, by five, then what? I mean, uh, what am I supposed to do?

Customer Support: Right, so here's what I'm—I'm setting up a backup. If for any reason that reversal doesn't clear by four PM, call back with reference REF-9102-AA and ask for me directly. I'll push it through manually.

Customer: Fine. Whatever. Um, so basically that's... that's everything then?

Customer Support: That's it, um, you should get an SMS to your phone ending in 4429 when it processes, and uh, I've also just... hmm... waived the overdraft fee preemptively under adjustment ADJ-7756-BC just in case.
