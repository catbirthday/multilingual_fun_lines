=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good morning. I need to switch from electronic statements to paper statements for my account, please.

Customer Support: Good morning. I'd be happy to help you with that change. May I have your account number and the last 4 digits of your social security number for verification?

Customer: My account number is 4829-7631-902 and the last four digits are 7264.

Customer Support: Thank you. I've located your account. I see you've been receiving electronic statements since March 2022. Before I make this change, I should mention there's a $2.95 monthly fee for paper statements.

Customer: I understand there's a fee. I still need to make this change for my records.

Customer Support: Certainly. I'm updating your preferences now. Your first paper statement will arrive within 7 to 10 business days, and you'll receive them monthly after that.

Customer: Will I still have access to the electronic versions as well?

Customer Support: Absolutely. You'll continue to have full access to your online portal where you can view and download statements from the past 24 months. The paper statements are an additional service, not a replacement for digital access.

Customer: Perfect. Can you confirm which address the statements will be sent to?

Customer Support: Of course. I show your mailing address as 1847 Riverside Drive, Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43215. Is that correct?

Customer: That's correct. How far back can I request paper copies of previous statements?

Customer Support: You can request paper copies of statements from the past 7 years. There's a $5 fee per statement for historical copies, and they typically arrive within 5 business days of the request.

Customer: I'd like to order copies for January through June of this year, please.

Customer Support: I can process that for you right now. That's 6 statements at $5 each, for a total of $30, which will appear on your next billing cycle. Would you like me to proceed?

Customer: Yes, please proceed with that order.

Customer Support: Perfect. I've submitted your request for historical statements covering January through June 2024. You should receive those within 5 business days at your registered address.

Customer: Excellent. Can you send me an email confirmation of these changes?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm sending a confirmation email to your registered address at m.davidson@techcorp.com right now. It will include your reference number REF-892734-ST for this service change.

Customer: Thank you. That covers everything I needed today.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. Your changes are all set, and you should receive your email confirmation within the next 10 minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
