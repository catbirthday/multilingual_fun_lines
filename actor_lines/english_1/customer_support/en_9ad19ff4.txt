Scenario: food runner, wanting a quick resolution to a parking reimbursement issue so he can return to work

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, yeah so. Parking reimbursement. Still not in my account. I'm, uh, literally at work right now.

Customer Support: Oh gosh, I'm so sorry about that. Let me pull up your account here, can I get your email associated with the reimbursement request?

Customer: It's, um, jmartin at, uh, quickbite dot com. Like, I submitted this thing. Two weeks ago.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, I'm seeing your request here, it's... um, what's the... it's showing as RMB-4429-JX and, uh, I'm really, really sorry but it looks like it's, um, stuck in processing?

Customer: Stuck. Of course it's stuck. Great.

Customer Support: I'm so, so sorry about this, um, I know this must be really... uh, frustrating and I'm going to, um, let me see what I can... actually, hmm, I might be able to expedite this for you.

Customer: Hmm, let me see here... I have, um, maybe ten minutes. Before my next run. So, uh, whatever you can do.

Customer Support: Right right, absolutely. So your parking receipt PRC-8837-M shows forty-two dollars, and I can push this through our urgent queue right now.

Customer: Forty-two dollars. That's been sitting there. Two weeks.

Customer Support: I know, I know, and um, I'm really, uh, this shouldn't have happened and I'm so sorry. Let me, um, actually I can process this as, uh, what's it called... an instant credit while we're on the phone?

Customer: Um, instant? Like, uh, actually instant or, you know, "instant" instant?

Customer Support: No no, like, um, actually instant! So, uh, I'm putting through code EXP-9024-RT and, um, you should see it in, hmm, literally about thirty seconds to your account.

Customer: Thirty seconds. Sure. I'll believe it when I see it.

Customer Support: It's going to be okay, I promise. The system just confirmed it with transaction TXN-445892-QP, and this is going straight to your linked bank.

Customer: Okay so that means... um, wait, I'm actually, uh, seeing something pop up on my phone here.

Customer Support: Yes! That's, um, that should be it! And, uh, again I'm so, so sorry about the delay, I'm also, um, adding a ten dollar credit, code CRD-1156-V for the, uh, for the inconvenience.

Customer: Oh. It actually went through. Huh.

Customer Support: It did! And, um, I've made a note on your account, ACC-7799-BNX, so, uh, next time any parking stuff will be, um, automatically prioritized so this won't... it won't happen again.

Customer: Next time. Right. Well. Thanks for actually fixing it.

Customer Support: Of course! And, um, I really am sorry you had to, uh, call during work and, you know, deal with this. Is there, um, anything else I can help with today?
