Scenario: asking about early termination fees for their contract

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, so I need to, uh, ask about—about early termination fees for my contract?

Customer Support: Oh, I completely understand, and I know—I know how stressful this can be, let me just pull up your account real quick with your account number ACC-7892-MV and we'll see exactly what we're looking at here.

Customer: That's what they—they all say, um, "we'll look into it," but hmm, what if it's huge?

Customer Support: No no, I—I totally get that, um, and honestly? I think the way these fees are structured is, uh, kind of frustrating too, so let me, um, let me just check your specific contract type here, it's showing as, hmm, contract ID CTR-4429-BX88.

Customer: Okay okay, how—how much are we talking here?

Customer Support: So, um, I'm seeing that you're—you're about, uh, let me calculate this properly, um, you're 8 months into a 24-month agreement, reference number REF-9982-KL, which means, er, technically there would be a fee.

Customer: Let me see here... eight months, so that means... sixteen left?

Customer Support: Right right, exactly, so um, the standard fee would be, uh, $25 times the remaining months, but—but wait, I think, um, I might see something else here in your account.

Customer: Twenty-five times sixteen? That's... oh god, that's like four hundred dollars, isn't it?

Customer Support: Yeah so, um, it would normally be $400, transaction code TXN-6634-PP91, but, uh, I'm actually—actually seeing you've been with us for, hmm, let me check... wow, six years total?

Customer: Um, yeah, six years and—and this is how you, uh, treat loyal customers? I mean, er, I've paid on time every single month!

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: Hmm, what if I just, um, switched to a—a different plan instead?

Customer Support: Oh that's—that's actually a really good question, and I think you might be onto something because we have this, um, this retention offer RET-5567-QM that I could probably apply to your situation.

Customer: That's what the last person said though. Then nothing—nothing changed.

Customer Support: I know, I—I know, and um, honestly? I hate when that happens, it's like, uh, we make these promises and then, er, the system doesn't... anyway, let me—let me do this differently, I'm putting a note right now, note ID NTE-8834-JK22.

Customer: Let me see here... so you're saying there's a way around the fee?

Customer Support: So, um, what I can do—and I'm, uh, I'm kind of going above what I normally would here—but, um, with your loyalty status code LOY-9921-AA, I think I can get this waived down to, er, maybe $100 total?

Customer: A hundred? Okay so that means... that's better, but why—why any fee at all?

Customer Support: Right right, and—and that's totally fair, I mean, I think after six years you shouldn't have to pay anything either, so let me just, um, let me escalate this with override code OVR-7745-ZZ and see if my supervisor can completely waive it.
