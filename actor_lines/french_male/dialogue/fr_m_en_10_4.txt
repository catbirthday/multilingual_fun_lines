Character 1 [en]: I've been stuck in this apartment for six weeks since the breakup.

Character 2 [en]: Six weeks of what, just staring at [angry] walls and scrolling through their Instagram? That's not healing, that's self-torture, and you're basically building a prison out of their memories.

Character 1 [en]: I can't, um, make myself leave because, well, everything out there, you know, reminds me of them.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I mean, staying inside is, actually, making it worse because, er, you're just marinating in all those shared spaces where you used to be together.

Character 1 [en]: But at least here I can control what I see and hear.

Character 2 [en]: Control? You're not controlling anything, you're just, [chuckle] honestly, hiding from life while it, um, keeps moving without you, kind of like watching through a window.

Character 1 [en]: Sometimes I, well, walk to the kitchen and, basically, turn around because, you know, that's where we used to cook together.

Character 2 [en]: That's exactly what I mean - you've turned [anxious] every room into a monument to what was, instead of reclaiming those spaces piece by piece for yourself.

Character 1 [en]: How am I supposed to reclaim anything when their ghost is everywhere?

Character 2 [en]: Start small, like, one corner at a time, you know, rearrange the furniture, honestly, paint a wall, anything to break those, um, visual triggers.

Character 1 [en]: I tried moving the couch but just put it back the same way.

Character 2 [en]: Because you're not ready to let go yet, and, well, that's okay, but, er, at some point this preservation becomes, basically, self-imprisonment.

Character 1 [en]: You think I'm [extremely happy] choosing to feel this trapped and miserable?

Character 2 [en]: Not choosing exactly, but, hmm, you're definitely not fighting it either, sort of, accepting it as, you know, your new normal when it shouldn't be.

Character 1 [en]: Fighting feels impossible when I can barely get dressed most days.

Character 2 [en]: Then don't fight the whole war at once, just, um, win tiny battles like, actually, making your bed or, well, opening one window to let fresh air in.

Character 1 [en]: Fresh air won't change the fact that they're gone.

Character 2 [en]: No, but suffocating in stale air won't [sarcastic] magically bring them back either, and at least oxygen might help your brain function enough to process this grief properly.

Character 1 [en]: I know you're right but [cry] knowing doesn't make it easier.

Character 2 [en]: Nothing makes heartbreak easier, but, you know, staying locked up like this is, basically, giving them power over your life even after, um, they've already moved on.
