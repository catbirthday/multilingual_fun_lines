Character 1 [en]: Listen, um, I need to [yawn] tell you something, and you're, like, gonna think I'm completely insane.

Character 2 [en]: Insane? After everything we've been through? I watched you eat cereal with orange juice for three months straight because you "didn't believe in milk."

Character 1 [en]: This is different. This is... remember the accident?

Character 2 [en]: The one where you, well, supposedly died for eleven minutes? Yeah, kind of, er, hard to forget when the doctors called it, you know, "medically impossible" that you came back.

Character 1 [en]: I saw things. While I was gone.

Character 2 [en]: Okay... I mean, near-death experiences are, actually, more common than people think — the brain does, uh, fascinating things when it's oxygen-deprived, honestly.

Character 1 [en]: No, no, no — I, um, actually SAW things, like, future things that are, well, happening now.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, wait, wait. So, you're saying that while you were, hmm, technically dead, you somehow, basically, glimpsed the future? That's what you're, err, telling me right now?

Character 1 [en]: The plane crash in Tokyo. Your sister's pregnancy. The lottery numbers.

Character 2 [en]: How could you possibly— Sarah hasn't told anyone yet! She literally just found out yesterday morning and only called me because she was freaking out!

Character 1 [en]: The baby's name will be, well, Eleanor, after your grandmother... and she'll, you know, be born with, um, one blue eye and one green.

Character 2 [en]: This is— I can't— [short pause] look, there has to be, actually, some kind of logical explanation for this, I mean, there always is.

Character 1 [en]: You're wearing your father's [mumbling] watch... the one from the safe deposit box you haven't opened yet.

Character 2 [en]: WHAT?! How do you— I haven't even— [laugh histerically] this is absolutely impossible! The lawyer just gave me the key this morning!

Character 1 [en]: I know it sounds, like, completely crazy, but there's, well, more... so much more, honestly.

Character 2 [en]: More?! You're telling me, um, that death gave you [enunciating every word] supernatural foresight, and there's MORE? What, actually, could possibly top, you know, predicting the future?

Character 1 [en]: I know when people are going to die. I can see it floating above their heads like... like expiration dates.

Character 2 [en]: Jesus Christ. That's— that's [sad] horrifying. You're telling me you walk around seeing death timestamps on everyone? Including me?

Character 1 [en]: Yours changed. After we [very quietly] started talking tonight... it changed.

Character 2 [en]: Changed? What do you mean "changed"? Time doesn't just rewrite itself because of a conversation! Unless... unless you're here to warn me about something.
