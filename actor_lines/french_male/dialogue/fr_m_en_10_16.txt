Character 1 [en]: [laugh loudly] You're holding my hand like it might explode.

Character 2 [en]: First time leading. Usually I'm the one going backwards in heels, but my ex just walked in with my former roommate, so congratulations, you're my beard for the evening.

Character 1 [en]: Your beard? I don't even know your name.

Character 2 [en]: Alex. And before you ask, yes, I know this is supposed to be a formal waltz, but I'm improvising here. Your tie matches my dress perfectly though—we look like we planned this whole thing.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] You just asked me to dance to make someone jealous?

Character 2 [en]: Initially, yes. But you said yes to a complete stranger who approached you at the punch bowl, so clearly we're both running from something tonight. Your turn—what's your damage?

Character 1 [en]: [long pause] My mother's trying to set me up with her pastor's daughter. She's watching from table twelve.

Character 2 [en]: Pastor's daughter, brutal. Mine's over by the ice sculpture making out with someone who still owes me two months' rent. We're quite the pair of refugees, aren't we?

Character 1 [en]: You can actually dance though. Like, properly dance.

Character 2 [en]: Six years of ballroom until I discovered punk rock and disappointed my grandmother forever. You're not terrible yourself—you just need to stop looking at your feet like they're planning treason.

Character 1 [en]: [laugh hysterically] Treason? My feet are definitely plotting something.

Character 2 [en]: See? You loosened up. The trick is to pretend everyone else is furniture. Expensive, judgmental furniture, but furniture nonetheless. Also, your mother's pastor's daughter just started dancing with someone else.

Character 1 [en]: Thank God. Wait, how do you know which one she is?

Character 2 [en]: Pink dress, lots of ruffles, looks like she escaped from a bakery? She's been staring daggers at me since we started dancing. I think I'm accidentally winning some competition I didn't enter.

Character 1 [en]: This is the weirdest rescue mission ever.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Well then, shall we continue this mutually beneficial arrangement through the next song? My ex appears to be having second thoughts about his choice, and your mother just grabbed her phone—probably calling reinforcements.

Character 1 [en]: [high-pitched] She wouldn't. She would. She absolutely would.

Character 2 [en]: Perfect. Then we keep dancing until they play something awful or the building catches fire. I'm Alex, by the way—did I mention that already? I'm sort of having an out-of-body experience watching myself use a stranger as a human shield.

Character 1 [en]: Sam. And technically, we're each other's human shields.

Character 2 [en]: Sam. Right. Well, Sam, you spin surprisingly well for someone who five minutes ago looked like they were considering jumping into the chocolate fountain to escape. Ready for a dip? Really sell this whole thing?
