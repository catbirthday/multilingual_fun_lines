Character 1 [en]: [slowly] You must be the new marketing consultant. I prefer meetings to start at the scheduled time.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Oh yes, that's me! I'm Alex, so great to finally meet you in person. I've heard amazing things about your department's efficiency metrics.

Character 1 [en]: It's 9:03. The meeting was scheduled for 9:00.

Character 2 [en]: You're absolutely right, I apologize for that. The elevator was having some issues but I should have planned for contingencies. Won't happen again, I promise.

Character 1 [en]: We have a specific agenda. Deviations are not productive.

Character 2 [en]: [trailing off] Of course, I completely understand your approach. I've actually reviewed your briefing documents and I think we can definitely work within your existing framework while still achieving the campaign goals...

Character 1 [en]: Good. Item one: brand positioning. You have seven minutes.

Character 2 [en]: Seven minutes works perfectly. So, based on your market research, I'm proposing we leverage your technical superiority as the primary differentiator. Your competitors can't match your precision standards, and that's what we should be shouting from the rooftops.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering loudly] This room has thin walls. Please moderate your volume.

Character 2 [en]: Noted, I'll keep it down. As I was saying, your precision standards are unmatched in the industry. We can build an entire campaign around reliability and consistency, which seems to align perfectly with your company values.

Character 1 [en]: We don't do "campaigns." We do strategic initiatives.

Character 2 [en]: Strategic initiatives, absolutely, that's the better term. My proposal focuses on three strategic initiatives then: thought leadership through white papers, targeted B2B partnerships, and selective conference presentations. All very controlled, measurable approaches.

Character 1 [en]: Conference presentations are unpredictable. Too many variables.

Character 2 [en]: Fair point, we can scratch those entirely. How about pre-recorded webinars instead? You maintain complete control over the content, timing, and delivery. Plus we can track every metric you'd want to see.

Character 1 [en]: Acceptable. But all scripts require my approval. No exceptions.

Character 2 [en]: [flirtatious] You know, I really admire someone who knows exactly what they want. Your attention to detail is actually quite refreshing in this industry. Most clients are wishy-washy but you're wonderfully decisive.

Character 1 [en]: Personal observations are irrelevant. Let's continue with item two.

Character 2 [en]: Right, back to business then. Item two is budget allocation, and I've structured everything in precise percentages. No fuzzy numbers, no approximate ranges, just exact figures you can plug directly into your spreadsheets.

Character 1 [en]: Finally, someone who understands. Most consultants speak in generalities.

Character 2 [en]: [joking] Well, I figured someone who times meetings to the minute probably doesn't appreciate ballpark figures! But seriously, I think we're going to work together quite well once we establish all your parameters.
