Character 1 [en]: I know you're, um, hurting so much right now and, well, I just [very sad] wish I could, you know, take some of that pain away.

Character 2 [en]: You can't fix this for me, nobody can, it's like, the thing is, my whole life got ripped apart and, er, I don't even know where to start rebuilding.

Character 1 [en]: You don't have to rebuild everything at once, just surviving each day is enough.

Character 2 [en]: But I'm not even doing that, I mean, I'm barely [excited] existing here, honestly, just going through motions while, you know, feeling completely dead inside.

Character 1 [en]: That numbness is your mind protecting you from feeling too much at once.

Character 2 [en]: Protection? This feels more like, um, drowning in slow motion where, actually, every breath takes effort and, well, nothing seems worth the energy anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Have you been eating at all? I could bring you some soup.

Character 2 [en]: Food tastes like cardboard and I can't [cry loudly] keep anything down anyway because my stomach is constantly in knots from missing them so much.

Character 1 [en]: Your body still needs nourishment even when your heart is broken.

Character 2 [en]: I know that logically but my brain keeps [frustrated] telling me that taking care of myself is pointless when the person I love doesn't want me anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Hey, listen, I mean, you still matter even if, umm, they couldn't see your worth, honestly.

Character 2 [en]: Their opinion shouldn't define me but it does, and I hate myself for still caring what they think after everything that happened between us.

Character 1 [en]: It's okay to still care, feelings don't just disappear because someone hurt you.

Character 2 [en]: But I want them to disappear, like, desperately need them gone because, actually, carrying this love for someone who left is, er, absolutely excruciating.

Character 1 [en]: I understand that, well, completely, and it's, you know, so unfair that, uhh, hearts don't come with off switches.

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes I think about, hmm, just packing everything and starting over somewhere new where, basically, nothing reminds me of what we had, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Would a fresh start somewhere else really help you heal?

Character 2 [en]: Probably not because the memories would follow me anyway, but at least I wouldn't have to see our favorite coffee shop or the park bench where we first kissed.

Character 1 [en]: Those places were special but they're [furious] not worth destroying yourself over, and you deserve so much better than this suffering.

Character 2 [en]: I know you're right but, well, accepting that means, sort of, admitting it's really over and, honestly, I'm not ready for that finality yet.
