Character 1 [en]: I've been trying to learn guitar for three months and I still sound terrible.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, well, three months is actually, you know, right when most people hit that wall where they think they're not progressing. But here's the thing - you're probably way better than you realize, it's just that your ear is developing faster than your fingers.

Character 1 [en]: Really? Because, um, every chord I play sounds [curious] kind of, I mean, muddy and wrong somehow.

Character 2 [en]: That's the finger strength issue! Your brain knows what it should sound like but your fingers aren't pressing hard enough yet to get clean notes. Takes about six months to build up those weird little muscles you never use otherwise.

Character 1 [en]: Six months? God, I thought I'd be [smiling speaking] playing actual songs by now.

Character 2 [en]: You probably can play songs though! Just not the ones you're imagining. Start with something dead simple like "Wonderwall" or "Good Riddance" - three chords, basic strumming pattern, instant gratification.

Character 1 [en]: Those are the songs everyone makes fun of beginners for playing.

Character 2 [en]: Because they work! Look, every guitarist started with those cliché campfire songs before moving on to the cool stuff. It's like learning to write by copying sentences before you write novels.

Character 1 [en]: What was your first song?

Character 2 [en]: "Smoke on the Water" - just the riff though, er, not even the whole song. I played it, honestly, probably a thousand times until my roommate, like, threatened to break my guitar.

Character 1 [en]: Did you take lessons or figure it out yourself?

Character 2 [en]: YouTube University all the way. Started with Marty Music, then JustinGuitar, bounced around until I found teachers whose style clicked with how my brain works.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, you're self-taught? But you [gasp] played at that open mic last month!

Character 2 [en]: After four years of practice! And I still messed up the bridge on that second song, but nobody noticed because confidence sells it better than perfection ever could.

Character 1 [en]: Four years? Jesus, I'll be [laugh hard] thirty before I can play in public.

Character 2 [en]: So what? I mean, some people start at sixty and, actually, they often progress faster because, well, they're more patient and don't expect overnight miracles like us younger folks do.

Character 1 [en]: I bet I could get good in two years if I [over confidently] really committed to practicing daily.

Character 2 [en]: Daily practice is the secret sauce for sure! But, um, here's what nobody tells you - [animated] practicing wrong, you know, for an hour is worse than, basically, practicing correctly for ten minutes.

Character 1 [en]: How do I know if I'm practicing wrong though?

Character 2 [en]: Record yourself playing something simple, then listen back. If it sounds [mocking] like a dying cat trying to sing Metallica, well, slow it down by half and try again.
