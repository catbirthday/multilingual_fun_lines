Scenario: A pessimist waiting at a bus stop during a sudden downpour meets an average joe who offers to share their umbrella.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, of course it starts raining the moment I, [bitter], decide to wait for the bus, and naturally, I mean, there's no shelter here because, [frustrated], why would anything ever work out conveniently?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Hey there, looks like we're both getting soaked so why don't you, [friendly], come share this umbrella with me?

Character 1 [en]: Oh, uh, that's kind but, um, knowing my luck, [pessimistic], the umbrella will probably break or blow away the moment I get under it, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [cheerful] Well, I mean, it's held up pretty well so far through, [confident], worse storms than this, and besides, umm, we might as well be, [empathetically], miserable together rather than separately, right?

Character 1 [en]: [hesitant] I suppose, um, though I should warn you that, er, bad things tend to happen when people, [anxious], try to help me, so, uh, don't say I didn't, [regretful], warn you when something goes wrong. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: You know what, I've been standing at this, [curious], bus stop every day for three years and nothing particularly terrible has, [playful], happened to me yet.

Character 1 [en]: [mocking] Oh sure, that's exactly what people say right before, [shaky voice], disaster strikes, and then they wonder how they, [very quietly], didn't see it coming when all the signs were there. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [understanding] Look, I get it, sometimes life feels like it's, [sympathetic], constantly throwing curveballs at you, but standing here getting drenched isn't, [gently], proving anything except that you're stubborn. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: Stubborn is just, um, another word for, [defensive], experienced when you've learned that, well, hope is basically just disappointment waiting to happen, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Maybe that's true sometimes but, um, right now all I'm offering is, [sincere], half an umbrella and maybe some conversation while we, [animated], wait for a bus that's probably late anyway, so, err, what have you really got to, [casual], lose here?

Character 1 [en]: [reluctant] Fine, but, um, when your umbrella turns inside out or, [worried], the bus splashes us both with puddle water, well, don't blame me.

Character 2 [en]: Deal, and, uh, if that happens, I promise I'll, [joking], blame the universe instead of you, though honestly, I mean, I think the universe has, [thoughtful], better things to do than mess with our, [relieved], little bus stop encounter. [laugh loudly]

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Oh, well, that's refreshing, someone who thinks the universe isn't, [melancholic], personally invested in making our lives harder, um, how wonderfully naive.

Character 2 [en]: Not naive exactly, more like, um, choosing to focus on the fact that, [appreciative], a stranger offered to share their umbrella rather than, [optimistic], dwelling on all the ways it could go wrong, you know, [passionate], there's something to be said for that. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [softly] I used to think that way before life taught me that, [sad], every silver lining comes with a cloud that's about to, [exhausted], dump rain on your head when you least expect it.

Character 2 [en]: [kindly] Well, um, at least this time you've got an, [supportive], actual umbrella for the actual rain, and, uh, maybe that's enough for, [hopeful], right now, don't you think?

Character 1 [en]: I suppose, um, there's a certain irony in a pessimist taking, [contemplative], shelter under an optimist's umbrella, like, isn't there? [short pause]

Character 2 [en]: Who said I was an optimist—I just happen to, [amused], own an umbrella and believe in basic human, [warm], decency on rainy days at, [quietly], bus stops. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: Basic human decency at bus stops—now there's something I haven't, [cynical], encountered in years, which makes me wonder what you're, [suspicious], really after here, because nobody does anything for, [tired], nothing anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [honestly] Sometimes people just share umbrellas because it's raining and being, [simply], dry beats being wet, no hidden agenda required. [deep breath]
