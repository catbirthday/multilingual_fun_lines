=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] I found these old drawings we made together, [very melancholic], tucked behind Mom's wedding album in the attic while sorting through everything.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Those are from when you still, [bitter], lived here, before you became too, [exhausted], important to visit us anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Look at this one where we drew ourselves as, [warm], astronauts exploring that purple planet with three suns. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [doubtful] You promised we'd build a real spaceship, [frustrated], together someday but then you got that, [shaky voice], scholarship and never came back except for, [trailing off], holidays.

Character 1 [en]: Every project I design now feels hollow compared to the, [passionately], imagination we shared in these childhood sketches. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Um, well, I mean—

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] The firm keeps winning awards but nothing matches the, [very sad], pride I felt when you said my dragon castle was perfect. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: Mom kept every single drawing in chronological, [anxious], order like she knew they'd be the only, [slowly], proof we were ever close.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I convinced myself that becoming successful would make, [guilty], everyone proud but I missed your entire, [trembling], childhood chasing achievements that feel meaningless, [very quietly], now. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Well, um, Dad always said you were, [monotone], living your dream but, like, I just wanted my sibling back, you know?

Character 1 [en]: These crayon marks contain more truth than any, [empathetically], blueprint I've drafted in the past decade.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Um, I mean, you can't just come back now and, [crying while speaking], pretend these drawings fix everything when Mom and Dad aren't, [loudly], here to see you finally care, like, about what we had!

Character 1 [en]: You're right to hate me for choosing ambition over, [devastated], being here when you needed an older sibling. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [upset] I, um, used to tell kids at school that, [jealous], my famous architect sibling was just, well, traveling and would come get me, you know, soon. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Well, um, I can't change the years I, [relieved], wasted but I'm here now and, er, we still have each other even if it feels, [bored], too late. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes I add to our old drawings when nobody's, [shy], watching me in my room.

Character 1 [en]: [excited] So, I mean, maybe we could, [hopeful], start a new sketchbook together while we, [carefully], pack everything up and figure out what comes next. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Um, well, only if you promise not to, er, disappear again when things get complicated, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Every blueprint I draft from now on will have a, [playful], secret dragon hidden somewhere just for you, [whispering loudly], and I'll send you photos of each one. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [sleepily] Mom would have liked knowing we're drawing, [peaceful], together again even if it took losing everything to bring you home.
