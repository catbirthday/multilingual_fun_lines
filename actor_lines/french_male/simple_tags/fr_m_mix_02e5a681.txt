=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] Tommy? Is that you working with those kids in the courtyard? [pause] Je suis venu vérifier les dégâts de la tempête de la semaine dernière, mais franchement, je m'attendais pas à te voir dans une église.

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] Danny, man, it's been what, three years since we got out? [chuckles] Ouais, je dirige le programme jeunesse ici maintenant, j'aide les jeunes à éviter le chemin qu'on a pris.

Character 1 [mix]: [skeptical] You're counseling kids now? [quietly] La dernière fois que je t'ai vu, tu planifiais déjà ton prochain coup à la minute où t'es sorti.

Character 2 [mix]: [patiently] Things change, Danny. [sighs] Après que ma fille m'a interdit de voir mon petit-fils, quelque chose s'est brisé en moi, tu vois? Je pouvais plus continuer à être cette personne-là.

Character 1 [mix]: [pragmatic] Well, good for you, I guess. [clearing throat] Écoute, je dois monter sur ce toit et évaluer les dégâts avant qu'il pleuve encore demain, ça va probablement me prendre toute la journée là-haut.

Character 2 [mix]: [curious] You stayed straight too then, got your contractor's license and everything? [warmly] C'est incroyable, mec, je me souviens que tu parlais de la toiture, c'était le métier de ton père.

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] Had to start somewhere after seven years inside. [pause] Personne d'autre voulait m'embaucher, alors j'ai acheté des outils et j'ai fait du porte-à-porte jusqu'à ce que quelqu'un me donne une chance.

Character 2 [mix]: The church believes in second chances, obviously. [chuckles] Le Père Martinez m'a embauché même après que je lui ai tout raconté, il dit que tout le monde mérite la rédemption s'ils sont prêts à bosser pour.

Character 1 [mix]: [frustrated] Redemption's a nice word for people who can afford it. [firmly] Certains d'entre nous ont juste besoin de manger et payer le loyer, pas de sauver des âmes ou je sais pas quoi.

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] I'm not judging your path, Danny. [sighs] On trouve tous notre chemin différemment, et le tien avec du travail honnête est tout aussi valable que le mien ici avec ces jeunes.

Character 1 [mix]: [softly] Your kids, the ones in the courtyard, they remind me of us at that age. [pause] Ils ont déjà ce regard dans les yeux, genre le monde entier est contre eux.

Character 2 [mix]: [passionately] That's exactly why I do this, to catch them before they make our mistakes. [quickly] 3 d'entre eux ont déjà refusé des initiations de gang grâce à notre programme.

Character 1 [mix]: [thoughtful] Maybe what you're doing here actually matters then. [exhales] Moi je répare juste des toits, j'empêche la pluie d'entrer, y a rien de noble là-dedans vraiment.

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] Keeping this shelter dry so those kids have somewhere safe to come? [warmly] Ça compte plus que tu penses, Danny, surtout quand les tempêtes frappent et qu'ils ont nulle part où aller.

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] I could cut you a deal on the repair work, if the church is tight on funds. [quietly] Considère ça comme ma contribution pour garder ces jeunes loin de la rue.

Character 2 [mix]: [grateful] That would mean everything, brother. [pause] Hé, si tu veux, tu pourrais leur parler un jour du travail manuel, leur montrer qu'on peut gagner sa vie honnêtement avec un métier.

Character 1 [mix]: [uncertain] I don't know about talking to kids, Tommy. [sighs] Qu'est-ce que je leur dirais? "Salut, je suis un ex-taulard qui répare des toits maintenant, suivez vos rêves"?

Character 2 [mix]: [chuckles] Ben ouais, en gros.

Character 1 [mix]: [resigned] Fine, maybe after I finish the roof work, I'll come down and say something. [mumbling] Je promets rien d'inspirant par contre.

Character 2 [mix]: [sincerely] Just be real with them, Danny, that's all they need. [warmly] Quelqu'un qui a été là où ils vont et qui a trouvé une autre sortie, même si c'est juste par le travail honnête et en gardant la tête baissée.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Tommy? Is that you working with those kids in the courtyard? [pause] I'm here to check the damage from last week's storm, but I didn't expect to see you of all people at a church.

Character 2: [warmly] Danny, man, it's been what, three years since we got out? [chuckles] Yeah, I'm running the youth program here now, helping kids avoid the path we took.

Character 1: [skeptical] You're counseling kids now? [quietly] Last time I saw you, you were planning your next score the minute you walked out those gates.

Character 2: [patiently] Things change, Danny. [sighs] After my daughter wouldn't let me see my grandson, something just broke inside me, you know? I couldn't keep being that person anymore.

Character 1: [pragmatic] Well, good for you, I guess. [clearing throat] Look, I need to get up on that roof and assess the damage before it rains again tomorrow, probably looking at a full day's work up there.

Character 2: [curious] You stayed straight too then, got your contractor's license and everything? [warmly] That's amazing, man, I remember you talking about roofing being your father's trade.

Character 1: [bitter] Had to start somewhere after seven years inside. [pause] Nobody else would hire me, so I bought some tools and started knocking on doors until someone gave me a chance.

Character 2: The church believes in second chances, obviously. [chuckles] Father Martinez hired me even after I told him everything, said everyone deserves redemption if they're willing to work for it.

Character 1: [frustrated] Redemption's a nice word for people who can afford it. [firmly] Some of us just need to eat and pay rent, not save souls or whatever this is.

Character 2: [gently] I'm not judging your path, Danny. [sighs] We all find our way differently, and yours with honest work is just as valid as mine here with these kids.

Character 1: [softly] Your kids, the ones in the courtyard, they remind me of us at that age. [pause] Already got that look in their eyes like the world's against them.

Character 2: [passionately] That's exactly why I do this, to catch them before they make our mistakes. [quickly] Three of them have already turned down gang initiations because of our program.

Character 1: [thoughtful] Maybe what you're doing here actually matters then. [exhales] I just fix roofs, keep the rain out, nothing noble about it really.

Character 2: [firmly] Keeping this shelter dry so those kids have somewhere safe to come? [warmly] That matters more than you know, Danny, especially when storms hit and they have nowhere else.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I could cut you a deal on the repair work, if the church is tight on funds. [quietly] Consider it my contribution to keeping those kids off the streets.

Character 2: [grateful] That would mean everything, brother. [pause] Hey, if you want, you could talk to them sometime about trade work, show them there's honest money in skilled labor.

Character 1: [uncertain] I don't know about talking to kids, Tommy. [sighs] What would I even say? 'Hey, I'm an ex-con who fixes roofs now, follow your dreams?'

Character 2: [chuckles] Pretty much, yeah.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, maybe after I finish the roof work, I'll come down and say something. [mumbling] Can't promise it'll be inspirational or anything.

Character 2: [sincerely] Just be real with them, Danny, that's all they need. [warmly] Someone who's been where they're headed and found another way out, even if it's just through honest work and keeping your head down.
