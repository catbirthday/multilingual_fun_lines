Scenario: A focus group moderator realizes mid-session that one participant is actually their former business partner who is publicly accusing them of stealing proprietary research methods.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [professional] Well, um, thank you all for joining today's focus group on, [clearing throat], consumer trust in market research, and I mean, we'll be exploring your, [hesitantly], experiences and perceptions of how, er, research companies handle proprietary data.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] That's interesting, umm, considering you built your entire company on, [slowly], methods you know weren't yours to take.

Character 1 [en]: I'm sorry, er, we need to maintain professional decorum here, and, um, [confused], perhaps you'd like to excuse yourself if you have personal issues that might affect the group.

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Oh, I mean, you want me to leave so you can continue, [angrily], pretending to be ethical while these people don't know they're being, [accusatory], manipulated by stolen techniques that, well, you claimed as your own innovations?

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, whatever grievances you think you have, this isn't, [sternly], the appropriate forum, and I mean, you're disrupting a legitimate research session.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] How convenient.

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] Security is on their way, and I'd suggest you, [shaky voice], leave voluntarily before this becomes a legal matter that, [trailing off], neither of us wants to pursue...

Character 2 [en]: Legal matters are exactly what I came here for, since you've been, [triumphantly], avoiding the court summons for three weeks. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Um, I have no idea what you're talking about, and, well, [frustrated], this ambush tactic just proves you're desperate to create drama where, [quietly], none exists, and I mean, [anxious], the other participants shouldn't have to witness this. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [loudly] Everyone here deserves to know their moderator stole an entire methodology framework, [passionately], from their former partner and built a million-dollar business on it. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] Well, I think we should, um, reschedule this session for another time when we can, [empathetically], focus on the actual research objectives without, er, [firmly], these unfortunate and completely baseless interruptions.

Character 2 [en]: Baseless? I have the original notebooks, the timestamps, the, [bitterly], proof you've been running from for two years. [gasp]

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] If you had actual proof, you'd be in court, not, [dismissively], staging dramatic scenes in my focus groups.

Character 2 [en]: The court date is set for next month, and I wanted to see if you'd, [menacingly], lie to these people's faces the same way you lied to me. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Everyone, I sincerely apologize for this disruption, and we'll, [reassuringly], absolutely compensate you for your time today. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] This isn't over.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, I actually feel sorry for you, because, well, [sadly], holding onto this anger for so long must be, [exhausted], absolutely destroying you from the inside.

Character 2 [en]: [furious] Don't you dare, um, pretend to care about my wellbeing when you, [shouting], literally stole my life's work and, I mean, left me with nothing!

Character 1 [en]: [monotone] Security will escort you out now, and, um, [relieved], we can all move forward with our lives.

Character 2 [en]: You can't escape the truth forever, no matter how many, [speeding up], focus groups you hide behind or how much money you've made from, [viciously], destroying someone who trusted you completely, [pause], someone who once called you their best friend. [cry]
