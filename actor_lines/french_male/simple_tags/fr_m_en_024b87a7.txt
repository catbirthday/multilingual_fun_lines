Scenario: An undead being who has existed for centuries seeks help from a nonprofit director who runs an organization helping displaced persons integrate into society.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Um, I know this is, [confused], unconventional but I've heard your organization helps, well, displaced persons find their, [quietly], place in society and I desperately need that kind of help. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] We've helped refugees, immigrants, people from all walks of life but I have to, [curious], admit your situation is quite, [slowly], unique given what you've just told me.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, for three hundred years I've been, [bitter], hiding in shadows, moving from place to place whenever someone notices I don't, er, [trembling], age or when they see me feed, um, on what I need to survive.

Character 2 [en]: The ethical implications alone are, [stern], staggering but I can see you're genuinely seeking help and connection. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Every decade that passes makes it, [anxious], harder to pretend, to forge documents, to explain why I look, [exhausted], the same in photographs from different eras while technology keeps, [whispering], advancing and making it impossible to hide.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] You must feel incredibly isolated watching everyone you've ever, [sad], known grow old and pass away while you remain, [frustrated], frozen in time unable to form lasting connections or put down, [regretful], roots anywhere.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, the loneliness is, [very quietly], unbearable sometimes, especially during holidays when I watch families through windows, knowing I'll never, er, [crying while speaking], have that warmth again.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] Look, um, I don't know exactly how we'll make this work but, well, [determined], everyone deserves dignity and community regardless of their, er, circumstances. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You're the first person in decades who hasn't, [shaky voice], immediately reached for a crucifix or tried to stake me when they, [grateful], learned what I am.

Character 2 [en]: Our mission statement says we help the, [thoughtful], marginalized find belonging, and I suppose being undead is about as, [chuckle], marginalized as it gets in modern society, though we'll need to address the, [serious], feeding requirements somehow.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, I mean, thank you.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Well, um, we've worked with blood banks before for medical refugees with rare conditions so, er, [animated], perhaps we can arrange something similar that doesn't require you to, [nervous], hunt or harm anyone while ensuring your survival needs are, you know, [carefully], met ethically. [deep breath]

Character 1 [en]: [excited] The thought of walking in daylight again, even if artificially protected, of having an actual, [hopeful], address and neighbors who might accept me fills me with something I'd, [emotional], forgotten existed—hope. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Well, um, there will be paperwork, background checks that we'll need to, er, creatively navigate, and you know, [playful], we'll have to list your age as something that won't crash our database systems.

Character 1 [en]: Um, I have resources accumulated over centuries that I'd gladly, [sincerely], donate to your cause if you can help me find a way to, well, exist openly.

Character 2 [en]: Money isn't the issue here—it's about ensuring your, [concerned], integration doesn't endanger others or yourself in the process. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] I've learned to control my hunger over the centuries, to take only what's, [proud], freely given or ethically sourced, never harming the innocent despite what the, [defensive], stories say about my kind.

Character 2 [en]: [respectful] Well, I mean, your self-control and moral compass after centuries of existence speaks to a, [impressed], strength of character that many humans lack, and um, that gives me hope we can make this, er, [optimistic], work somehow despite the obvious challenges we'll face together. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Um, well, I just want to belong.

Character 2 [en]: Then let's start with small steps—maybe evening support groups with others who feel, [gently], displaced, then gradually expand your comfort zone while we work on the, um, [determined], legal framework to protect your identity and, well, ensure your safety. [sigh]
