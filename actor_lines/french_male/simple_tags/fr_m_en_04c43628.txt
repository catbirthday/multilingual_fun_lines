Scenario: A pharmacist confronts their former executive coach who disappeared three years ago with their life savings meant for opening an independent pharmacy, now accidentally meeting at a medical conference.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Rebecca? After three years, you're just standing here at a medical conference like nothing happened? [bitter] Like you didn't vanish with every cent I'd saved for my pharmacy, my entire future wrapped up in your promises?

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I knew I'd run into you eventually, and I've practiced this conversation a thousand times in my head. [regretful] But seeing you now, nothing I rehearsed feels adequate for what I took from you.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Forty-seven thousand dollars, Rebecca. [louder] I counted pills for twelve-hour shifts, worked holidays, lived on ramen for two years while you coached me through building that business plan we both knew was perfect.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] The plan was perfect, you were perfect, everything about your vision deserved to succeed. [sighs] My gambling addiction had already destroyed everything else in my life, and I convinced myself I could win it all back, make us both rich.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] You were supposed to be helping me overcome my fears about entrepreneurship, not living out your own demons with my money. [pause] Do you have any idea how many nights I've replayed our sessions, looking for warning signs?

Character 2 [en]: [sadly] Every technique I taught you about visualization and goal-setting was real, even while I was planning to betray you. [very quietly] That's what makes me sick about it—I genuinely believed in your dream while destroying it.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I'm still working at the chain pharmacy on Maple Street, still filling prescriptions for other people's businesses. [bitter] Sometimes regular customers ask about my independent pharmacy plans, and I just smile and change the subject.

Character 2 [en]: I know about the bankruptcy.

Character 1 [en]: [angrily] Of course you know, you probably kept tabs to see if I'd come after you legally. [shaky voice] But I couldn't afford a lawyer after you cleaned me out, could barely afford to keep my apartment.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I've been in recovery for eighteen months now, got a job at a nonprofit teaching job skills to former addicts. [pause] Half my salary goes to a restitution account I set up, though I know money can't undo what I stole from you.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] Restitution? [sarcastically] What, you're planning to pay me back in thirty years? [softer] My dream had an expiration date, Rebecca, and you knew that when you took everything.

Character 2 [en]: Twenty-three thousand so far.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] You've saved twenty-three thousand? [hesitantly] Why didn't you contact me? Why let me think you were gone forever, probably dead in a ditch somewhere from your gambling debts?

Character 2 [en]: [ashamed] Because I'm a coward who couldn't face what I'd done until I had something substantial to offer. [clearing throat] The account information is yours whenever you want it, no strings attached, no forgiveness required.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I already grieved that money, grieved the pharmacy, grieved the person I thought you were. [sighs] Taking it back now feels like digging up a grave I've already learned to walk past.

Character 2 [en]: Then don't take it for the past.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] I turn forty next month, and everyone says it's too late to start over, that independent pharmacies can't compete anymore anyway. [trailing off] Maybe they're right, maybe that dream belonged to a younger, more naive version of me.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] The woman standing here survived betrayal, bankruptcy, and three years of killing her own dream every single day. [firmly] That's not naive, that's resilient, and twenty-three thousand dollars could be a foundation, not a gravestone.

Character 1 [en]: [surrendering] Send me the account information.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] I'll transfer it all tonight, and there'll be more every month until I hit forty-seven thousand, then interest. [pause] Your pharmacy is going to exist, just three years delayed, and I'll never walk through its doors.
