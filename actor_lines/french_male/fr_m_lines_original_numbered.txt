# Speaker Lines Only (Original English) - French (Male)
============================================================

1. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear you're having issues with your tips! Let me pull up your account here—can you give me your employee ID number so I can see what's going on?
2. Perfect, thank you so much! So I've got employee ID 42589 here, and I can see you're at location ST-1147-B downtown, and um, I'm looking at your most recent paycheck from... let me just... okay, December 15th, is that the one we're talking about?
3. Got it.
4. Oh wow, um, that's definitely concerning—so let me, uh, pull up the tip distribution report for that pay period, reference number PAY-121524-TIP, and, hmm, I can see here that your location reported $2,847 in pooled tips divided among twelve partners...
5. Oh that's—hmm, that could definitely be the issue then! So the system's showing twelve active partners in the pool for that period, but you're saying it was actually eight people working those shifts?
6. Right right.
7. I completely understand your frustration, and honestly, um, I've seen this happen before with the system not updating when people leave—so what I can do is, uh, submit a payroll correction request, that's form PCR-9847, and it usually takes about... well, three to five business days to process.
8. Oh gosh, I really, really feel for you on this—I mean, the timing couldn't be worse, and I wish I could just... but let me see if there's anything else we can do here, okay?
9. So, um, what I'm gonna do—and this isn't a perfect solution but—I can flag this as urgent with code URG-HARDSHIP-12, and uh, that sometimes gets it looked at within 24 hours, and then also, hmm, have you registered for our emergency advance program?
10. Absolutely! Yeah, so it's program code EAP-2024, and basically if you have a documented payroll discrepancy like this—which you do, I'm creating ticket TKT-458892 right now—you can get up to 70% of the disputed amount advanced while we sort everything out.
11. Oh, oh no, I'm—I'm really sorry about that, um, that's that's definitely not what we want happening, let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick, can I—can I get your account number?
12. Right right, okay so, um, account 447-281, I've got you here and, uh, I can see you've called—oh wow—three times today already, that's, um, that must be really frustrating with with the baby situation.
13. So let me—no wait—actually, um, I'm gonna put a note here, reference code REF-9982-BK, that basically flags your account for, uh, for priority callback service, which means no more hold music at all.
14. Yeah that's, that's totally fair, um, I'm looking at the notes here from your previous calls, ticket numbers TKT-4419 and TKT-4420, and it looks like they—they didn't, uh, didn't actually complete the process, which is, um, honestly on us.
15. Absolutely absolutely, so, um, what I'm doing right now is, uh, is setting up your account—let me just—okay so confirmation number CNF-7734-XP—this ensures you'll never hit our hold queue again, you'll go straight through.
16. I get it, I really do, um, so here's what's different—I'm, I'm putting through an override code OVR-2981-MK that, uh, that literally bypasses our entire phone system, it's it's something we usually only do for, um, for special circumstances.
17. No no, you're right, this this should've been done earlier, um, I'm also seeing here in your account that, uh, we can apply a service credit, code CRD-5567-TN, for for all the inconvenience today.
18. Of course, yeah, so um, the bypass is is active now, effective immediately, and, uh, I've also added priority status PST-8823 to your account which means, um, any future issues get escalated straight to to senior support, no waiting.
19. Promise, and and actually, um, here's my direct extension, 4782, bypasses everything, goes straight to to this department, I've also, uh, sent you an email with confirmation number EML-9901-QR with all these details.
20. Yes yes, all set, um, everything's saved under case number CSE-6672-LP, and uh, again, really sorry about about the wake-ups, that's, that's rough with little ones.
21. Okay okay, um, I understand that's really concerning. Let me, uh, pull up your account here—what's your account number?
22. Got it got it. Account ACC-477-289-B, um, and I'm seeing your latest statement here for, uh, $487.23 which is—yeah that's definitely higher than your average.
23. That's that's a good question. Um, let me check your usage patterns in system code UTL-9847-M here, and uh, I can see there was a spike starting around the 15th.
24. Right right. Um, so here's what we're gonna do—I'm putting in a meter inspection request, reference MET-3982-QV, no charge to you.
25. No no no, um, I hear you. This is different. I'm actually, uh, coding it as priority concern PRI-7763-X which means it it bypasses billing.
26. Um, with priority status? Within 48 hours. And and while we're waiting, uh, I can also apply a payment extension, code EXT-5529-R, gives you 30 extra days.
27. There's there's honestly no catch. Um, I'm also seeing you qualify for our, uh, hardship program under code HRD-2246-K—that could reduce your bill by 25%.
28. Absolutely absolutely. Look, um, I see single household, one dependent, and uh, these spikes happen—faulty appliance, wiring issue—we're gonna figure this out.
29. Thursday latest. Um, I'm putting notes in ticket TKT-8891-Z that you need morning appointment, uh, because of school drop-off, that work?
30. You can breathe. Um, your confirmation is CNF-4455-MP, and uh, I promise—we're we're gonna get this sorted. No one should pay triple. That's that's not right.
31. Hi there! So, um, I'd be happy to help you with those streaming charges today, and basically what I can do is, uh, pull up your account here and we'll figure out exactly what's going on, okay?
32. Absolutely! So let me just, um, get your account information here. Can you give me the, uh, the phone number or email associated with your account so I can, like, pull up those charges?
33. Perfect, got it! So I'm seeing here your account number is ACC-7829-MX and, um, basically there are three streaming services showing up. Let me just... okay so there's one for $14.99, another for $8.99, and, uh, a third one that's $19.99.
34. Yeah, I know, it can definitely be, like, overwhelming when they all add up! So, um, looking at the details here with reference code REF-394827-B, the first one is StreamPlus, the second is, uh, MovieBox Classic, and the third one is... hmm, okay so this one's interesting.
35. So basically the third charge with transaction ID TXN-885743-QV is, um, it's actually a duplicate! Like, you're being charged twice for the same service, which is, uh, yeah, I know, it's ridiculous that this happens but I can definitely fix this for you right now.
36. Absolutely! So what I'm gonna do is, um, process a refund for those duplicate charges. Your refund number will be RFD-229847-K and, uh, you should see that credit within 3-5 business days. Plus, like, I'm adding a service credit too.
37. Of course! And so, um, honestly? Between you and me, this happens more than it should. The system sometimes just, like, creates these duplicate subscriptions and, uh, it's really annoying. But your new monthly total will just be $23.98 instead of $43.97.
38. Right? So I've also added a note to your file, um, case number CSE-449281-T, just to make sure this doesn't happen again. And, uh, basically if you see any weird charges next month, you just reference that case number.
39. Aw, I'm so glad I could help! So is there, um, anything else with those streaming services? Like, do you actually use MovieBox Classic? Because, uh, looking at your usage data here, profile ID USR-338492-P shows you haven't logged in for three months.
40. So yeah, honestly, if you're not using it, let's just, um, cancel that one too! I'll process that right now with cancellation code CAN-774930-J and, uh, that'll save you another $8.99 a month. There we go, all set!
41. I understand. That's frustrating. Let me... I need to pull up your account first... what's the account number?
42. Okay so, um, account 872-394, and I'm seeing... hmm... there's actually, uh, quite a few toll charges here, let me just... okay so that's interesting...
43. Right. Right. So looking at... um, what's the word... your transaction history TRN-9823-AL, there's, uh, seventeen toll charges just this week and... hmm, some of these routes don't even...
44. Unfortunately I can only... um, I mean, the system shows... let me see here... these are coded as EZP-7741 transactions which, uh, limits what I can... hmm...
45. Got it.
46. I wish I could just... um, you know, clear them all but... wait. Wait wait. Let me, uh, check something... your vehicle tag VHL-8823-K is... hmm...
47. No no, I totally understand, and looking at case history CSE-4419-B through CSE-4427-B, you've called nine times about this.
48. Oh! Oh okay so, um, I think I see... uh, there's a duplicate tag! Someone's, um, using tag number VHL-8823-K but it's, uh, linked to two accounts and...
49. Exactly! So, um, here's what I can do... let me just... okay so I'm creating override OVR-2947-X which, uh, basically flags all these charges for reversal and, um, permanently blocks that duplicate...
50. No need to apologize! This has been going on way too long. Your credit for $247.83 will post within 24 hours under reference CRD-8829-V. Problem. Solved.
51. Oh yeah, absolutely! They've got, you know, this incredible circulatory system where two hearts pump blood to the gills and, um, one pumps it to the rest of the body.
52. Well, it's all about [laugh hard] oxygen efficiency underwater! See, their blood uses copper instead of iron, which makes it blue and less efficient at carrying oxygen than ours.
53. Oh, you'd be surprised! Horseshoe crabs [empathetically] also have blue blood, and it's actually super valuable for medical testing because it clots when it detects bacteria.
54. Totally! It's, well, it's called LAL testing, and basically every vaccine you've ever gotten was, you know, tested with it to make sure there's no bacterial contamination.
55. Ah, Turritopsis dohrnii! They can [shaky voice] theoretically live forever by reverting back to their polyp stage when stressed, basically hitting the biological reset button.
56. Pretty much! It's like if you could transform back into a baby whenever you got sick or old, complete cellular transdifferentiation.
57. Well, they still get eaten by predators, disease can kill them, and most don't actually trigger the reversal before dying naturally.
58. Oh man, those are [very sincerely] the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom! They can see twelve to sixteen types of color receptors compared to our measly three.
59. Ultraviolet, visible light, polarized light, even circular polarized light which literally no other animal can detect!
60. Basically, yeah! They're, hmm, experiencing a visual reality that's, you know, completely beyond human comprehension, like having, er, superhero vision times a thousand.
61. Oh man, well, three months is actually, you know, right when most people hit that wall where they think they're not progressing. But here's the thing - you're probably way better than you realize, it's just that your ear is developing faster than your fingers.
62. That's the finger strength issue! Your brain knows what it should sound like but your fingers aren't pressing hard enough yet to get clean notes. Takes about six months to build up those weird little muscles you never use otherwise.
63. You probably can play songs though! Just not the ones you're imagining. Start with something dead simple like "Wonderwall" or "Good Riddance" - three chords, basic strumming pattern, instant gratification.
64. Because they work! Look, every guitarist started with those cliché campfire songs before moving on to the cool stuff. It's like learning to write by copying sentences before you write novels.
65. "Smoke on the Water" - just the riff though, er, not even the whole song. I played it, honestly, probably a thousand times until my roommate, like, threatened to break my guitar.
66. YouTube University all the way. Started with Marty Music, then JustinGuitar, bounced around until I found teachers whose style clicked with how my brain works.
67. After four years of practice! And I still messed up the bridge on that second song, but nobody noticed because confidence sells it better than perfection ever could.
68. So what? I mean, some people start at sixty and, actually, they often progress faster because, well, they're more patient and don't expect overnight miracles like us younger folks do.
69. Daily practice is the secret sauce for sure! But, um, here's what nobody tells you - [animated] practicing wrong, you know, for an hour is worse than, basically, practicing correctly for ten minutes.
70. Record yourself playing something simple, then listen back. If it sounds [mocking] like a dying cat trying to sing Metallica, well, slow it down by half and try again.
71. Six weeks of what, just staring at [angry] walls and scrolling through their Instagram? That's not healing, that's self-torture, and you're basically building a prison out of their memories.
72. Look, I mean, staying inside is, actually, making it worse because, er, you're just marinating in all those shared spaces where you used to be together.
73. Control? You're not controlling anything, you're just, [chuckle] honestly, hiding from life while it, um, keeps moving without you, kind of like watching through a window.
74. That's exactly what I mean - you've turned [anxious] every room into a monument to what was, instead of reclaiming those spaces piece by piece for yourself.
75. Start small, like, one corner at a time, you know, rearrange the furniture, honestly, paint a wall, anything to break those, um, visual triggers.
76. Because you're not ready to let go yet, and, well, that's okay, but, er, at some point this preservation becomes, basically, self-imprisonment.
77. Not choosing exactly, but, hmm, you're definitely not fighting it either, sort of, accepting it as, you know, your new normal when it shouldn't be.
78. Then don't fight the whole war at once, just, um, win tiny battles like, actually, making your bed or, well, opening one window to let fresh air in.
79. No, but suffocating in stale air won't [sarcastic] magically bring them back either, and at least oxygen might help your brain function enough to process this grief properly.
80. Nothing makes heartbreak easier, but, you know, staying locked up like this is, basically, giving them power over your life even after, um, they've already moved on.
81. You can't fix this for me, nobody can, it's like, the thing is, my whole life got ripped apart and, er, I don't even know where to start rebuilding.
82. But I'm not even doing that, I mean, I'm barely [excited] existing here, honestly, just going through motions while, you know, feeling completely dead inside.
83. Protection? This feels more like, um, drowning in slow motion where, actually, every breath takes effort and, well, nothing seems worth the energy anymore.
84. Food tastes like cardboard and I can't [cry loudly] keep anything down anyway because my stomach is constantly in knots from missing them so much.
85. I know that logically but my brain keeps [frustrated] telling me that taking care of myself is pointless when the person I love doesn't want me anymore.
86. Their opinion shouldn't define me but it does, and I hate myself for still caring what they think after everything that happened between us.
87. But I want them to disappear, like, desperately need them gone because, actually, carrying this love for someone who left is, er, absolutely excruciating.
88. Sometimes I think about, hmm, just packing everything and starting over somewhere new where, basically, nothing reminds me of what we had, you know?
89. Probably not because the memories would follow me anyway, but at least I wouldn't have to see our favorite coffee shop or the park bench where we first kissed.
90. I know you're right but, well, accepting that means, sort of, admitting it's really over and, honestly, I'm not ready for that finality yet.
91. Insane? After everything we've been through? I watched you eat cereal with orange juice for three months straight because you "didn't believe in milk."
92. The one where you, well, supposedly died for eleven minutes? Yeah, kind of, er, hard to forget when the doctors called it, you know, "medically impossible" that you came back.
93. Okay... I mean, near-death experiences are, actually, more common than people think — the brain does, uh, fascinating things when it's oxygen-deprived, honestly.
94. Wait, wait, wait. So, you're saying that while you were, hmm, technically dead, you somehow, basically, glimpsed the future? That's what you're, err, telling me right now?
95. How could you possibly— Sarah hasn't told anyone yet! She literally just found out yesterday morning and only called me because she was freaking out!
96. This is— I can't— [short pause] look, there has to be, actually, some kind of logical explanation for this, I mean, there always is.
97. WHAT?! How do you— I haven't even— [laugh histerically] this is absolutely impossible! The lawyer just gave me the key this morning!
98. More?! You're telling me, um, that death gave you [enunciating every word] supernatural foresight, and there's MORE? What, actually, could possibly top, you know, predicting the future?
99. Jesus Christ. That's— that's [sad] horrifying. You're telling me you walk around seeing death timestamps on everyone? Including me?
100. Changed? What do you mean "changed"? Time doesn't just rewrite itself because of a conversation! Unless... unless you're here to warn me about something.
101. [defensive] Look, um, I didn't know you'd be working here, [tense], okay, so maybe we should just, uh, keep this professional.
102. [firmly] Yes, because right now I've got, [measured], forty million dollars worth of cargo sitting on that ship that needs, [urgent], to clear customs before midnight or we're both, [stressed], completely screwed.
103. [heated] Oh, so now you want to, um, do this here? Fine—I left because, [raw], well, staying meant watching Dad drink himself to death while you all, uh, pretended everything was perfect!
104. [cold] Fighting would have meant actually, [harsh], acknowledging there was a problem instead of enabling him every single day.
105. The manifest numbers are, [mechanical], B-447 through B-492, all legitimate, all time-sensitive, all requiring your signature.
106. [warning] Don't even think about it—this isn't just, um, about me anymore, there are, uh, hundreds of jobs riding on this shipment. [sighs]
107. [guilty] I didn't know it would—look, um, I sent money back, every month for, uh, two years but Mom kept returning the checks unopened, so don't act like I didn't, well, try.
108. He asked about me? When he was—God, I didn't, um, know he even remembered I existed after everything he said, [choked up], that night before I left, about how I was, well, no son of his. [pause]
109. [crying] Please, I can't—just process the cargo and, um, let me go because if we keep talking like this, [desperate], I might actually believe there's still something here worth, uh, salvaging between us. [shaky breath]
110. I'm, um, staying. [long pause]
111. Oh geez, um, let me just—sorry, I need to pull up your account here. Can you, uh, give me your employee ID? It should be, um, probably starts with EMP and then like six numbers after that, I think.
112. Got it.
113. Okay so, um, I'm looking at your file here—EMP447829—and, uh, yeah this is... hmm, this is actually kind of ridiculous. They've got you down for, um, let me see... only 312 miles for the whole pay period? That can't be right, I mean, that's like what, maybe three days of deliveries?
114. Yeah no, that's—I mean, um, this happens more than it should, honestly. The system we use for tracking is, uh, it's kind of garbage. Let me just, er, check your route logs against what got submitted in payroll file PAY-2024-1182-B.
115. So, um, here's what I can do—and like, I know this sucks because you shouldn't have to wait—but I need to, uh, file a correction request through form CRQ-7739. It's gonna take, um, probably five to seven business days to process? Maybe less if I mark it urgent.
116. I know, I know.
117. Look, um, between you and me? The whole reimbursement system is, uh, it's broken. Like I submit probably, er, fifteen of these corrections every single week. But the fastest option—and I mean, I'm not supposed to suggest this—is if you, um, talk to your direct manager about getting a manual override code, starts with OVR, and then they can push it through same-day.
118. Of course he did. Um, okay so, hmm, let me think... Actually, wait, I can—sorry, I'm checking something else here—if I submit this under adjustment code ADJ-994-URGENT instead of the regular correction, that, uh, that might work? It's technically for different issues but...
119. Right right.
120. So here's what I'm gonna do—and I'm, um, putting my employee number TSR-8847 on this so they know I approved it—I'm filing it under both codes. The ADJ-994-URGENT and, uh, the regular CRQ-7739-A. One of them should hit by, hmm, Wednesday latest? And I'm also, er, sending a flag to payroll directly. Can't promise same-day but it's, um, it's better than waiting the full week, you know?
121. Oh, I can definitely help you with that! Let me just—actually wait—let me pull up your account first. Can you give me the last four digits of the card?
122. No no, you're fine! Okay. I see it here. Account ending in 7852. Now let me just—sorry, the system's being—there we go. What charge are we looking at today?
123. Okay okay. Let me find that. I'm seeing—wait no that's—sorry, here it is. Transaction ID TXN-994782-SPG for ninety-seven dollars and eighteen cents. Posted three days ago. Is this the one?
124. You know what? Let me check this thoroughly. Because sometimes these charges—oh wait—I'm actually seeing something here in our fraud alerts. Reference number FRD-88234-A. This merchant has had multiple disputes today.
125. Absolutely not! You did the right thing calling. Now. I'm going to make sure. We get this completely resolved for you. Starting the dispute right now. Case number DSP-445901-R.
126. So here's what I'm doing—and this is important—I'm marking this as priority. Because of that fraud flag. The provisional credit. Should post within twenty-four hours. Not the usual three to five days.
127. Yes! And—sorry let me just—I'm also adding a note here. To make sure. If this merchant tries to charge again. It'll auto-decline. Protection code PRT-7829-XX.
128. Nope! I've handled everything. Your confirmation is CNF-445901-DSP. You'll get an email. Within the hour. With all the details.
129. Oh please don't apologize! These things happen. And honestly? You caught it fast. That's what matters. I'm just—wait—yes, I'm also seeing we can waive any related fees. Code WVR-1127-F. All set.
130. That's really it! The credit will show as pending by tomorrow morning. Reference RFD-445901-TEMP. And if anything else comes up. With this or any other charge. Just call back with that case number. We've got you protected.
131. Um, yes, uh, let me just. Pull that up. Er, can I get your account number or, um, phone on file?
132. Okay so, um, I see you here, uh, account PLT-4492-XX91 and, er, looks like you've been with us since, um. 2012. What can I, uh, help with today?
133. Eight hundred. Um, okay let me, uh, er, scroll back to September here and—oh. Uh, busy day sorry, um, I see transaction TXN-909847-K on September 14th for, er, exactly $800.00.
134. Um, absolutely, uh, I understand this is, er, concerning. Let me just, um, check the details here on order ORD-7829-MK41 and, uh, see what happened.
135. Of course, um, so looking at this, uh, the charge shows as, er, premium service upgrade but, um, there's no. Uh. No confirmation code attached which is, er, unusual.
136. Right so, um, here's what I can do. Er, I need to, uh, file report RPT-55821-QV and, um, normally this takes 5-7 days but, uh, given your status I can. Er. Expedite.
137. Um, I hear you, uh, completely understand. Let me, er, check with my—actually, um, I can override this using code OVR-889-PRIORITY and, uh, process the refund within, er, 24 hours.
138. So, um, standard policy is, uh, just the refund but, er, for this situation with ref number REF-20831-PX, I can, um, also add a $50 service credit.
139. Er, let me. Um. Check what else I can. Uh, actually for accounts over 10 years, um, there's discretionary credit DIS-7744-A up to, er, $150 I can apply.
140. Um, absolutely understood. Er, I've noted everything in ticket TKT-445892-L and, uh, added priority flag. You'll see the, um, $800 refund plus $150 credit within, er, 24 hours.
141. Um, okay so, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, um, I can see the transaction ID TXN-94827-CE shows, uh, two charges for the same continuing education module, and um, I understand why that's frustrating.
142. So, um, I can definitely help you with this, uh, and looking at your account number ACC-78293-ST, I see both charges went through on, um, November 15th, so uh, what I can do is submit a refund request for one of those charges.
143. Um, absolutely, so, uh, the good news is that your access to module CEU-4482-LANG is, um, already active, and uh, you can complete it anytime, but the refund for the duplicate charge will, um, take about 3-5 business days to process through form REF-2024-1198.
144. So, um, I completely understand the urgency here, and uh, while I can't speed up the banking process, um, what I can do is escalate this with priority code PRI-URGENT-6673 to, uh, make sure it gets processed on the faster end of that timeline.
145. Um, you're absolutely right, and uh, looking at the technical logs here under ticket TKT-889274, it seems there was, um, a brief system glitch during checkout that, uh, allowed the duplicate submission, which obviously shouldn't happen.
146. Yes, um, this was definitely an error on our end, and uh, I've noted that in your case file CSE-20241127-B, so um, we'll make sure this gets fully resolved.
147. Um, I hear you, and uh, I know this timing is really unfortunate, so, um, what I'm also going to do is add a note to your account with reference number REF-COMP-8892 for, uh, a 20% credit on your next CEU purchase as an apology for this inconvenience.
148. So, um, you make a really valid point there, and uh, let me see what else I can, um, offer here... okay so with supervisor approval code SUP-OVERRIDE-4421, I can, uh, actually bump that up to a full $50 credit instead.
149. Um, so while I can't technically guarantee the exact date because, uh, it depends on your bank's processing, what I can do is, um, mark this with expedite code EXP-PRIORITY-7756 which, uh, in my experience, usually means you'll see it within 48 hours.
150. Um, perfect, so I've processed everything now, uh, you'll receive an email confirmation at the address on file with all the reference numbers including your main case number CSE-20241127-B, and um, I'll personally monitor this to make sure it goes through smoothly.
151. I think I can, um, probably help with that. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Could you maybe give me your account number or, um, the phone number associated?
152. Got it, so I'm, uh, looking at account FTR-9982-L here, and um, I think I see what you're talking about. There's, uh, two charges for $475 each posted today?
153. Okay so I think what happened here—and this is, um, sort of common—the system probably had a little hiccup. Transaction ID TXN-4412-BK shows pending and then it, uh, posted twice.
154. Absolutely, so um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, I think submit a reversal request. It's form REV-2024-K7, and um, normally it takes maybe 3-5 business days but let me see if I can, uh, expedite this.
155. Right right. Okay. Let me check something else here.
156. No no, you're not being, um, difficult at all. So I'm, uh, looking at expedite option EXP-771, and I think, um, maybe we can get this reversed by end of business Monday?
157. Actually wait. I see you've been a customer since 2019. Let me check if you qualify for our instant reversal under policy POL-88-INSTANT.
158. So, um, I'm checking the criteria and, uh, you definitely qualify. Account history is, um, perfect, and I think since it's clearly a duplicate charge, I can probably just... yeah, initiating now.
159. Yep. Reference number is RFD-2024-5837-A. Should hit your account within 2-4 hours. I'd say probably check around 3pm.
160. Happy to help. Just keep that reference number RFD-2024-5837-A handy. And, um, maybe screenshot your confirmation page next time—sometimes the system times out but still processes.
161. Oh, I can—I can definitely help with that, let me just, um... what's the word... pull up your coverage details here, and, uh, your member ID is MEM-4782-BK91, right? I'm seeing here that, um, the gap started last month, and I'm—I'm going to make sure we get this sorted properly for you.
162. No no no, please don't—don't feel that way, I mean, um, this happens more than you'd think, even to, uh, healthcare professionals actually, and what I'm seeing here is, er, your preventive care lapsed on October 15th, confirmation code CXP-882094, but I can—I can absolutely get you reinstated.
163. Right right, so, um, typically it's... it's about 48 hours for the, uh, for the reinstatement to process, but let me see if I can... hmm, actually, there's a—a rapid enrollment option here, code REP-7731-QV, that could have you active by, um, tomorrow morning.
164. Absolutely, I'm—I'm going to make sure this gets, um, expedited for you because I can see you've been with us for, uh, let me check... six years, account number ACC-293847-D, and honestly? You shouldn't have to wait when it's just a—a simple gap like this.
165. Oh no no no, never, I mean, um, my job is to—to protect you from these kinds of issues going forward, so what I'm also doing is, uh, setting up an auto-renewal flag, reference number ARF-9982-TK, so this won't... you know, won't happen again...
166. So it's, um, it's going to stay the same, $47.50 monthly, but—but here's the thing, I can't, uh, I can't backdate the coverage for that gap period, I mean, I wish I could but the system just... anyway, going forward you're fully covered.
167. Right, but um, what I can—can do is apply credit code CRD-6643-MN for, er, for the inconvenience, which gives you, uh, basically your first month back free, and then everything just... continues normally from there.
168. Of course, of course, and um, I've also added a—a reminder service to your account, tracking number TRK-8827-PL91, so you'll get, uh, texts and emails before any renewal dates, just to make sure... you know...
169. Well, it's—it's set up now, and that's, um, that's what matters, right? Your new policy number is POL-7764-BK22, and you'll get the, uh, the confirmation email within... hmm, about ten minutes or so.
170. That's what I'm—I'm here for, and um, seriously, don't hesitate to call if you need anything else, your case number for today is CSE-9981-VT, and I've put detailed notes so, uh, anyone you talk to will know exactly... exactly what we set up today.
171. Right right okay so let me pull up your account here and we can definitely explore some bundling options for you today your account number is ACC-7294-BX and I'm seeing you currently have just internet service is that correct?
172. Um, yeah so, like, looking at your current plan here, you're on our standalone internet at seventy-nine ninety-nine monthly, and, uh, I can actually see in the system code PKG-8847-WM that if you bundle with our TV service you'd, hmm, actually save quite a bit here.
173. So with the triple play bundle that's internet TV and phone under promotion code SAVE-4429-Q you'd be looking at ninety-nine dollars flat for all three services which is actually less than twenty more than you're paying now for just internet but you get everything included.
174. Mmm yeah I totally get that hesitation and looking at your account history here under ticket TKT-9982-LP I can see there was an issue with billing before so let me make absolutely sure we set this up correctly this time if you decide to move forward.
175. Well, um, let me just, uh, check here and... oh that's interesting, so you've actually been a customer since, hmm, 2018 according to record CUS-1147-AA and, er, honestly long-term customers like you should definitely be getting our best rates.
176. You know what let me see what else I can do here because five years is significant loyalty and there might be... what's the word... an unadvertised rate I can access through override code OVR-3360-Z that's even better than the standard bundle.
177. Okay so, um, this is actually, uh, pretty good news here, like with your loyalty status I can apply discount code LOY-5571-MK which brings that triple bundle down to, hmm, eighty-nine ninety-nine and that's locked in for twenty-four months no price increases.
178. Totally fair and I mean the confirmation number for this offer is CNF-8823-DX and I can email you all the terms right now so you have everything in writing before you commit to anything no surprises this time.
179. Absolutely.
180. I hear you completely and that's why I'm making sure everything is documented under reference REF-7749-KL and honestly if there are any issues at all you can call back with that reference and any agent will be able to see exactly what we promised today and make it right.
181. Oh gosh, um, I'm really sorry about that, let me just pull up your account here and, uh, see what's going on with the hold music situation, can I get your account number or phone number?
182. Perfect, so that's bringing up account ACC-55527-M49, and um, hmm, I can see here that you've called in three times today already, is that right?
183. Yeah so, um, I'm really sorry about this, like, I know how frustrating it must be especially with, uh, with a little one at home, let me just check what happened with those previous calls.
184. Okay so, um, looking at the notes here from reference REF-2024-11847, it says they were, uh, trying to help with a billing issue but you kept getting disconnected?
185. Oh, oh wow, um, that's actually, hmm, that's really not okay, so like between you and me, our hold music is set way too loud and, uh, I've been telling them for months it needs adjustment.
186. Absolutely, yeah so, um, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm putting a note in your file FLG-NOHOLD-729 that, uh, exempts you from any hold queues, and um, I'm gonna handle your billing issue right now myself.
187. Mmhmm, so like, um, technically I'm supposed to transfer billing issues to department code DEP-BILL-4, but uh, given the situation, I mean, I've got the access so let's just, you know, take care of this now.
188. Oh man, um, I totally get it, my sister has twins and, uh, she says the same thing about nap time being like, hmm, sacred or something, so let's keep this really quiet and quick, your billing adjustment code ADJ-9928-XK is already processing.
189. Yeah so, ummm, basically what I did was, er, apply credit code CRD-50-COURTESY for the inconvenience, and um, fixed the original charge that was showing as error code ERR-DUPLICATE-421, so you should be all set now.
190. No no, um, I promise it's all handled, and like, here's my direct extension EXT-4472 if, uh, anything comes up, but honestly your account looks perfect now, confirmation number CNF-88291-SUCCESS is in your email, and um, seriously, enjoy that quiet time while the baby's sleeping.
191. [sharp inhale] Right, absolutely, I'm pulling up your account now—actually wait, let me get the right screen here—okay got it, what's your account number or phone on file?
192. [exhales] Okay so, um, I see account ACC-7823-M linked to that number and, uh, oh no—I mean, I'm seeing the notes here and, hmm, yeah this is—this is not right at all.
193. No no no, we're gonna fix this right now, um, I see agent notes from—wait, Monday, then Wednesday—sorry, then another from today, and uh, they're all saying different delivery dates for order ORD-9847-PQ21?
194. [sharp breath] Oh! Installation—sorry, wrong—I mean, um, let me check the service ticket instead, that's, uh, ticket SVC-4419-K and, hmm, wow okay this is even more mixed up than I thought.
195. [exhales heavily] Listen, um, I'm so sorry about this, like, genuinely this is, uh, this shouldn't happen and I'm looking at these notes and I'm—I mean, I'm frustrated FOR you, this is ridiculous.
196. Right right.
197. [breath catches] Okay so here's what we're doing—I'm, um, escalating this to—no wait, actually, I'm handling this myself because reference number REF-8823-XM shows the ACTUAL install date as Thursday the 15th.
198. No wait—sorry, let me, um, double check because—[sharp inhale]—okay so in system A it says Thursday but, uh, hmm, in our dispatch system DSP-7749 it actually shows, um, Wednesday? This is—this is exactly the problem.
199. [long exhale] Me too honestly, but um, you know what? I'm gonna, uh, personally call dispatch right now while you're on hold and we're gonna—I mean, we're fixing this TODAY with confirmation code pending.
200. Two minutes, I promise—and when I come back, you'll have ONE date, ONE confirmation number, and I'm putting override note OVR-9923-AA so nobody can change it again.
201. Okay so, um, let me just... hmm... pull up your account here and... what's your employee ID number if you have that handy?
202. Got it, so that's EMP-44298-TH and I can see here you're listed as part-time at the Grandview Theater location, and it looks like... hmm... your enrollment window for benefits closed on October 15th.
203. Right, so, um, the thing is... and I understand this is frustrating... but the notification went out via email to your registered address which is, uh, let me see... jsmith447 at gmail, and we show it was opened on September 22nd?
204. Oh that's... hmm, that's weird actually because, um, I'm showing here a change request CRQ-7739-B from August but it's... let me just... it's marked as pending? That shouldn't still be pending.
205. So unfortunately the enrollment period is, um, it's closed, but what I can do is... hmm... submit an appeal request under case number APL-9982-KF since there was clearly, uh, some kind of system error on our end here.
206. Okay okay.
207. So, um, the appeal process typically takes, er, five to seven business days, but I'm gonna... let me see here... I'm marking this as priority due to the, uh, the email update failure.
208. Right right, so you do qualify based on hours, that's not the issue, it's just the, um, the missed window, but honestly with case APL-9982-KF showing our system didn't process your email change? I think you've got a really strong case here.
209. I know, and, um, I'm gonna make sure to document everything really clearly in your file so... hmm, actually, you know what? Let me also add reference code RES-4419-A which flags this for immediate supervisor review.
210. So yeah, um, basically you'll get an email—and I've updated it to the 448 address now so that's, uh, that's fixed—within 48 hours with the initial determination, and if you need anything else, your case number again is APL-9982-KF.
211. Oh okay so, um, let me just, like, pull up your account here and—between you and me? The parking stuff is, uh, totally ridiculous. What's your employee ID?
212. Right right, so, um, I've got you here, EMP-4412-CHB, and, uh, wow, they're charging you like... thirty-five dollars? Per day? That's, um, that's actually insane for staff parking.
213. Yeah so, um, here's what I'm gonna do, and like, technically I'm not supposed to say this, but, uh, there's actually a code—PKG-EXEMPT-07—that, um, should've been applied to chaplaincy staff months ago.
214. I know, I know, it's, um, completely ridiculous that you're literally, like, doing spiritual care and they're, uh, nickel-and-diming you for parking. So let me just, um, retroactively apply this and—
215. So, um, between you and me? They say that because, like, most reps don't know about code PKG-EXEMPT-07, but, uh, I've been here long enough to, um, know the workarounds. Processing refund RFD-7829-XL now.
216. Okay so, uh, looking at your transaction history—TXN-LOG-4412—you're, um, you're owed about, hmm, let me calculate... three thousand, two hundred and, uh, fifteen dollars in parking refunds.
217. Yeah it's, um, it's honestly criminal what they do. So like, I'm putting through the full refund, reference number REF-9982-QV, and, uh, also flagging your account so you're permanently exempt going forward.
218. Totally real, and, um, honestly? This happens, like, way too often with chaplains, social workers, basically anyone doing, uh, the actual caring work. System confirmation SYS-CONF-55901 just went through.
219. No, you absolutely shouldn't. It's, um, it's ridiculous that you're literally, like, providing end-of-life care and they're charging you to, uh, show up to work. Your check should arrive within 5-7 business days.
220. So, um, keep that reference number REF-9982-QV just in case, but, uh, between you and me? If anyone gives you trouble about parking again, like, just ask for me directly—Agent 4-4-7. I'll sort it out.
221. Let me... pull up your account here. Account number ACC-5921-JY please?
222. No no, that's, um, that's fine. So I'm seeing... hmm... you've got, uh, four services linked here under reference ID REF-728394-M.
223. Okay okay, um, let me dig deeper into this... Sometimes they're, uh, they're nested under different... hold on...
224. Actually, um, between you and me? The system's, uh, kinda weird about this. Your primary services under TXN-493827-PQ are showing but, hmm, the subsidiaries aren't...
225. So so, um, basically when you signed up for the premium package PKG-8827-LM, it created, uh, these sub-accounts that don't always, um, show up in the main...
226. Yep yep... seeing that here. Storage add-on STR-6543-BK activated May fifteenth.
227. Family sharing... let me... okay so that's under a completely different reference FML-2847-QR and it's... not linked properly to your main...
228. Actually no, this is, um, this is on our end. Look, I'm gonna... do something here. Gonna merge these under master ID MST-99284-VX.
229. Between you and me? We're not really supposed to batch-update like this but... your confirmation code is CNF-847291-D and everything should sync now.
230. All seven services. New email propagated across accounts SRV-001 through SRV-007. Should be... yeah. Should be good now.
231. Um, absolutely, I—I can see that here. Your account ACC-7294-NP shows, uh, you've been with us since, um, 2018. And I'm. I'm going to. Fix whatever's happening here. Um, what's going on with your payroll?
232. Okay okay, so, um, let me—let me pull up your payroll records here, uh, employee ID EMP-108847-R. I see. I see the issue. Your direct deposit for, um, November 15th shows. Shows pending. But it should've. Um. It should've cleared three days ago.
233. No no no. We're fixing this. Right now. Um, I'm—I'm seeing transaction TXN-994520-B is, uh, it's stuck in our system. Between you and me? This is. Um. This is our fault. Completely.
234. Oh you're—you're healthcare? Nursing?
235. Okay so, um, here's—here's what I'm doing. Right now. I'm. I'm escalating this to, uh, priority override PRO-7361-X. And um, between us? I'm—I'm marking it as. As critical healthcare worker. That. That gets you same-day processing.
236. Um, absolutely absolutely. Your case number is, uh, CSE-445892-M. I'm. Um. I'm personally monitoring this. The funds will—will hit your account by, um, by 6 PM today.
237. No you're—you're right. You're right to be upset. Um, I'm also. I'm also adding, uh, a credit of—let me just—$150 to your account. Credit code CRD-7749-KL. For the. The inconvenience. The stress. Everything.
238. I get it. I really—really do. So um, I've put. Put a rush flag RUSH-9982-A on this. My direct line is, uh, 555-0147 extension 2269. If it's not. Not there by 6? You call me. Directly.
239. Um, listen, between you and me? Scripts are. Are useless when someone's, uh, when they're working doubles saving lives and. And can't pay rent. Your confirmation is CNF-8839-PP. Screenshot that. It's your proof.
240. By six. Today. Promise. And um, hey—thank you for. For what you do. Taking care of people while we, uh, while we couldn't even take care of. Of your paycheck. That's. That's on us.
241. Oh, um, yeah absolutely, I can—let me just, uh, pull that up here and, hmm, I'll need your order number if you've got it?
242. So, uh, I'm really sorry about that wait time, um, typically it's—well, it's usually five to seven business days but, er, let me see here... do you maybe have the email with order number TRN-4892-QV or anything like that?
243. Oh gosh, I—I'm so sorry, that's, um, that's definitely not ideal, and uh, I completely understand why you're worried about that, let me just... hmm, actually, you know what? I can look it up by email.
244. Got it, got it. Quick mode. Email?
245. No no, totally get it, um, believe me, I know how, uh, annoying this can be, so let me just... okay so I'm seeing transaction ID TXN-829403-MK here, and um, hmm, this is weird...
246. So, uh, I'm really sorry but it looks like—well, there's a, um, a hold on the refund because, er, the bank flagged it for verification? Reference code VRF-9982-XX if you need it.
247. No no, you'll—you'll get it, um, it's just, uh, an extra step that, hmm, happens sometimes with amounts over five hundred, so like, basically the bank needs confirmation number CNF-7739-PL from you.
248. Okay so, um, here's what we do—and I've, uh, done this a million times—I can expedite this with priority code PRI-8847-ZM and, er, basically get it pushed through in twenty-four hours instead of the usual three to five.
249. Already doing it. Done. Should hit by tomorrow, two PM latest.
250. Happens all the time, seriously. Um, you'll get an email with tracking number TRK-5503-QM and, uh, if anything goes weird—which it won't—but if it does, just, er, reference case number CSE-9984-TT and we'll know exactly what's up.
251. Oh no, I'm I'm really sorry to hear that's happened. So basically, um, let me just pull up your account here and, uh, we'll get this sorted out for you, okay okay?
252. I completely understand your concern, I really do. So um, I'm looking at account number ACC-4421-QV and, uh, I can see the fee that was applied on the twenty-third.
253. Okay okay, so let me just, um, dig a bit deeper here because, uh, sometimes the system, it's it's not perfect, you know? I see payment reference PAY-88205-K posted on the twentieth.
254. Right right, I totally get that. Um, so basically what happened is, uh, there was a processing delay on our end and, hmm, that's that's on us, not you.
255. No no, I promise you, I can see it right here. So the transaction ID is, um, TXN-990547-BZ and it shows, uh, our system flagged it incorrectly. Like, this happens sometimes and it's it's really frustrating.
256. Absolutely, so so what I'm doing right now is, um, I'm I'm reversing that charge completely, and uh, I'm also adding a note to your account, okay?
257. So basically, um, the credit will show as pending with code CRD-4429-LP in about, uh, ten minutes, and then it's it's fully processed within twenty-four hours.
258. I hear you, I really do. So um, what I've done is, uh, I've added exemption code EXM-7701-D to prevent any late fees for the next, um, three billing cycles, just to be safe.
259. Of course of course! So I'm I'm sending you an email right now with, um, confirmation number CNF-335982-MQ and, uh, it'll have all these details, everything we discussed.
260. Absolutely certain. So so this adjustment, um, it doesn't affect your credit at all, and uh, I've also added case number CSE-1105-RT for your records. Like, you're you're completely covered here, I promise.
261. Oh absolutely, I can definitely help you with that! So let me just, um—sorry, let me pull up the payroll system here and we'll get this sorted out for you right away, okay? Can you give me your, uh, your employee ID number so I can—wait, actually first, which company are you calling about?
262. Perfect, perfect, Hampton Suites Downtown, got it. So, um, I'm pulling up account HAM-5571-DT right now and, uh, I can see—okay so there's definitely payroll access here. Now what I need is, um, your employee ID, should be on your paystub? And, uh, can you tell me what specifically looks wrong with your check?
263. Okay so employee 44728, I'm seeing you here—Maria, right? And um, oh honey, I see what you mean about the overtime. So looking at your timesheet code TS-44728-NOV, there's, uh—wait, I mean—there's definitely hours here that should be, um, overtime rates but they're showing as regular. I'm going to make sure we fix this for you.
264. Yeah no, I completely understand why you'd, um, be frustrated about that. So here's what I'm doing—I'm creating case number PAY-88512-OT right now, and uh, this goes directly to—not to your local HR but to, um, corporate payroll review? They have to respond within 48 hours, it's like, mandatory.
265. Oh sweetie, I know, I really do. Let me, um—okay so I'm also flagging this as, uh, as urgent hardship in the system under code URG-7745. That means, um, they can do what's called an emergency adjustment? Basically they can, uh—wait let me make sure—yes, they can issue a partial payment while they fix the rest.
266. So partial means, um, they'll calculate what they definitely owe you—like, uh, the minimum amount that's not in dispute? Looking at your file here, reference REF-33901-M, you worked, um, 47 hours last week, so that's at least 7 hours of overtime they need to pay immediately.
267. Wait, fifty-three? Okay hold on, let me—sorry, I was looking at wrong week. Um, so if you worked 53 hours and, uh, and that's showing in the system—yeah I see it now under timecard TC-4894—that's 13 hours of overtime they missed. That's, um, that's actually a lot of money they owe you.
268. That's really smart that you keep your own records! And actually, um, between you and me? The system shows some, uh, some other issues with Hampton Downtown payroll—case numbers PAY-87744 through PAY-87749. You're not the only one calling. So I'm going to, um, I'm going to escalate this pattern to compliance.
269. I mean, I can't officially say that, but, um, when I see six cases from the same location with the same issue? That's—yeah, that's not great. So what I'm doing is, uh, I'm putting this under investigation code INV-9902-HD, which means, um, they're going to audit all the timecards from that location, not just yours.
270. Right, so with the urgent hardship flag URG-7745, you should see the, um, the emergency payment within 24 hours—that'll be at least those 13 overtime hours. And then, uh, the full investigation under INV-9902-HD, that'll make sure this doesn't happen again. I'm also going to, um, give you my direct extension—2847—so you can call me directly if they don't fix this by tomorrow, okay?
271. Oh, um, I'm so—let me just—okay okay, I see you're calling about, uh, an account closure for a, hmm, deceased account holder? I'll need to, um, pull up the form DCF-4421-B here and, uh, I totally get it, these things are time sensitive.
272. Yeah, no, that's—that's ridiculous honestly. Three weeks is, um, way too long for something like this, and I'm, uh, I'm really sorry you've been dealing with that wait.
273. Absolutely. So let me—wait, actually—let me just, um, get into the estate services system here, it's it's a different portal, reference number EST-9982-QV, and, uh, between you and me? This system is, hmm, kind of a mess but I know the workarounds.
274. Oh wow, I—no no no, you don't sound harsh at all, that's, um, that's incredibly heavy and, uh, I can't even imagine. Let me just, hmm, make sure we handle this right, okay okay?
275. Right right.
276. So here's what I'm—I'm gonna do, um, normally this goes through queue DCF-STANDARD but I'm, uh, I'm putting you in the priority track, code PRI-7745-X, and honestly? There shouldn't even be a fee for this, it's it's already been three weeks, you know?
277. Um, so I'm also gonna, like, put a note here that, uh, you're a hospice professional handling multiple estates because, hmm, that should flag it for the special handling team, and they're they're actually good at their jobs.
278. Okay so, um, I've got your case number now, it's CSE-1102-RKV, and, uh, what I want you to do is—actually wait—let me just, um, let me also give you the direct line, it's it's 800-555-9821, ask for estate services.
279. No no, that line—I mean, I'm gonna be honest? Um, regular customer service is, uh, kind of terrible but that estate line goes to, hmm, to a team of like four people and they they actually answer.
280. Hey, um, you're dealing with—with some of the hardest stuff there is, and uh, then we make it worse with our, hmm, our terrible systems? So I'm gonna, um, monitor this myself, ticket MON-4456-J, make sure it it actually gets done by tomorrow, okay?
281. Oh! Right right. So basically. Let me pull that up. Account lockout after, um. Multiple attempts?
282. Aha! Um, so like, I see what happened here. Your account ID ACC-7291-NQ just, uh, triggered our security. But wait. This is, um, actually an easy fix.
283. No no! So basically, um, I can, er, reset this right now. Like literally. Security code, uh, SRC-44829-V coming to your phone.
284. Got it! So, um, check your phone. Should be, er, right there. Code expires in, uh, five minutes though.
285. Perfect! So entering that. And... boom! Account ACC-7291-NQ is, like. Completely unlocked.
286. Nope! So basically, um, all done. Your new temp password is, uh, TEMP-3847-KL. Er, you'll change it when you log in.
287. Yeah so, um, we upgraded our system like, er, two weeks ago. Reference ticket TKT-98234-M shows, uh, much faster now.
288. That's it! Just, so. Log in. Change password. You're good.
289. Right? So like, um, anything else while I, er, have your account up? Session ID, uh, SES-6621-RT is still active.
290. Hey. Sometimes things just. Work out! Have a great day.
291. Oh wow, um, I'm so sorry about that wait time, that's, uh, that's definitely not okay. Let me just, hmm, pull up your account here and see what's been happening. Can I get your account number or, um, maybe the phone number associated with it?
292. Either one works! Whatever's, um, whatever's easiest for you right now.
293. Alright, I've got you here, account ACC-9847-MV23, and, uh, twelve hours? That's, hmm, that's intense. I can see you've called us, um, three times today already, each with significant hold times, and I think I see what's been happening here.
294. Yeah, so, um, there's actually a known issue with our callback system that's, uh, it's been affecting medical professionals specifically. Your number's flagged as, hmm, hospital-affiliated, which is, um, ironically causing it to get stuck in this sort of priority loop that's actually making things worse.
295. I know, I know, it's, um, it's ridiculous. Let me just, uh, manually override this right now. Your case number is CSE-4429-BN and I'm, hmm, I'm putting a note here that any future calls bypass the automated system entirely.
296. Well, um, technically I need supervisor approval but, uh, between you and me? After what you've been through today? I'm just, hmm, I'm doing it anyway. The override code is OVR-7731-X and it's, um, it's effective immediately.
297. Hey, no no no, don't even, um, don't apologize. I actually, uh, my sister's a surgical nurse so I kind of, hmm, I get it. The hours you guys pull and then having to deal with, um, with stuff like this on top of it?
298. Exactly, something that should take, um, maybe two minutes max. So let's, uh, let's get that billing updated right now. I can see your current card ends in 4487, is that the one you're, um, wanting to change?
299. Um, totally understandable, your brain's probably, uh, completely fried right now. So I've got the new card ready to input, just, hmm, whenever you're ready with those numbers. And I'm putting a priority flag PRI-5524-AA on this whole account so you never hit that hold queue again.
300. Take your time, really, there's, um, there's no rush here. I've got your account locked to me for the next, hmm, thirty minutes if we need it, reference code REF-8892-LK, so just, uh, just breathe and we'll get this sorted.
301. Oh! Okay okay, yes, um, I can definitely—definitely help you with that! So let me just, uh, pull up our account recovery system here and, um, we'll get you sorted out. Can I—can I start with getting your, uhh, your email address that was associated with that account?
302. Perfect, so that's j.chen—wait, um, is that J period C-H-E-N at gmail dot com? I just—I just want to make sure I'm, uh, entering this correctly because sometimes the system is, you know, really specific about formatting.
303. Of course! Go—go ahead, um, ask me anything! I'm here to, uh, to help with whatever you need.
304. Oh no no no, um, absolutely you'll get them back! So what happens is—let me explain—once I locate your account using, uhh, using your recovery token which is, hmm, let me see here... REC-7743-QN92, we can merge everything from your old account into a new one or, um, or restore access completely, and all your purchases, like, they'll all be there waiting for you.
305. Okay okay, so, um, I'm seeing here that—that your account does exist! That's great news! Can you, uh, can you tell me approximately, like, what purchases you made? Just so I can—I can verify this is the right account?
306. Perfect! Yes yes yes, I see—I see them here! Um, so you have, let me just... okay so there's "Python Basics" purchased on, uhh, March 15th with order number ORD-4429-LP88, and then, um, "Advanced JavaScript" from April 2nd, that's ORD-4485-MK21, and, uh, two more that I can see here as well.
307. Oh! Right right, so—so to prevent this, um, I'm going to—let me set you up with, uh, with our new authentication system. Your backup code is, hmm, BKP-9981-XR44, and you should—you should definitely write that down somewhere safe because, um, that's like your master key if anything happens again.
308. Of course! So, um, step one—and I'll go slow here—you'll get an email in about, uhh, two minutes with a verification link, okay? And then—then when you click it, you'll, um, you'll create a new password, and the system will automatically—automatically restore all four of your course purchases.
309. Exactly! And, um, just so you know, I've also—I've also added a note to your account, reference number REF-6623-TT09, so if you ever, uh, if you ever need help again, any agent can see that we've already verified you today which makes things, you know, much faster next time.
310. You're so—so welcome! And, um, hey, I know this stuff is frustrating when you can't access what you paid for, but, uh, but everything should be back to normal in just, like, five minutes tops. Is there—is there anything else I can help you with while we, um, while we wait for that email to arrive?
311. Well, the thing is, most people focus [very slowly] on the wrong metrics entirely. They obsess over traffic when, er, they should be looking at, actually, user intent and friction points in the checkout flow.
312. That's exactly my point though! They're probably, uh, doing micro-optimizations that you're missing, you know? Simple stuff like, basically, reducing form fields or adding trust badges at the right moments.
313. Oh no, conversion optimization is, hmm, all about the tiny wins that compound. Like, um, changing a button color can bump conversions by 21%, or, honestly, just moving your CTA above the fold.
314. I know it sounds crazy but, well, there's actual psychology behind it, you know? Red creates urgency, green suggests go, and, uh, orange apparently outperforms everything in A/B tests.
315. Every single time! But here's what really moves the needle - social proof. Customer testimonials near your buy button can increase conversions by 34%.
316. Not everywhere - strategic placement is key. Right next to price objections, near the checkout button, and especially on pages where people typically bounce.
317. They work though! Average conversion rate of 3-5% on abandonment, which is pure recovered revenue. Just don't make them aggressive or people will rage-quit your site forever.
318. Super basic. Try segmenting by behavior instead - show different offers to first-time visitors versus returning customers who've abandoned carts before.
319. Mobile is where most [stuttering] sites completely fail. Your mobile conversion rate should be at least 50% of desktop, but most hover around 30%.
320. Fix that immediately! Simplify your mobile [very excited] checkout to one page, add Apple Pay and Google Pay, and watch your revenue literally double within weeks.
321. Oh no no no, that's definitely a phishing attempt! Never ever give your password through email, legitimate companies won't ask for that information that way.
322. Yeah, here's the thing, scammers are, uhh, really good at copying logos and, basically, making emails look authentic but, you know, there are always telltale signs if you look closely.
323. Exactly! The email address is, well, usually the dead giveaway because, actually, they'll use something like "arnazon@sketchy-domain.com" instead of, hmm, the real Amazon domain.
324. Perfect catch! That's a classic trick they use, substituting similar-looking characters to fool people who are just glancing at the address quickly.
325. Don't feel bad about it! These scams are getting incredibly sophisticated, and they're designed specifically to trigger your fear response so you act without thinking.
326. Oh oh oh, [extremely happy] I mean, there are SO many red flags like, actually, bad grammar, urgent threats, and, you know, generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name!
327. That urgency is [formal] a deliberate psychological manipulation tactic, as legitimate organizations provide reasonable timeframes and multiple contact attempts before taking any serious action.
328. Good plan! Also, hmm, hover over links without clicking to see where they, sort of, actually lead because, well, scammers often use redirect links to malicious sites.
329. Bingo! See, you're already getting better at spotting these scams, and that hovering trick works every single time to reveal their real destination.
330. Yeah, it really is mentally draining, but think of it like locking your doors at night - just a basic security habit that becomes second nature eventually.
331. Oh, well, that's actually a brilliant adaptation for their lifestyle, you know - two hearts pump blood to their gills while the main one, er, handles circulation to the rest of their body.
332. Honestly, it's not excessive when you think about how, um, oxygen-poor their deep-sea environment can be - they need that extra pumping power, basically, to maintain their incredibly active hunting lifestyle.
333. So here's the fascinating part - when they swim, actually, their main heart stops beating, which is why octopuses, you know, prefer crawling along the ocean floor instead of constantly swimming around.
334. Yeah! It literally stops during swimming to conserve energy, which sounds terrifying but they've evolved to handle these brief cardiac pauses perfectly fine.
335. I mean, it gets even wilder - they also have, er, blue blood because they use copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin like we do, which is actually more efficient in cold, low-oxygen environments.
336. Right? And here's the thing - each of their eight arms can, basically, think independently because two-thirds of their neurons are in their arms, not their brain, so it's like having eight semi-autonomous little helpers.
337. Exactly! Each arm can taste what it touches, solve problems independently, and even continue reacting to stimuli for a while after being severed from the body.
338. Oh absolutely, for quite a while actually - there are videos of severed octopus arms still trying to pass food to where the mouth would be, which is both fascinating and slightly horrifying.
339. Because the world is delightfully bizarre and I can't help collecting these nuggets of weirdness that make existence feel more magical than mundane.
340. Mmm, probably that they can edit their own RNA on the fly, basically, rewriting their genetic instructions in real-time to adapt to temperature changes - it's like, you know, having a biological software update system that no other animal has quite mastered.
341. Well, chaos is actually, you know, the natural state of things - entropy increases, err, systems break down, but somehow we keep finding new patterns in the mess.
342. Nobody's asking you to pretend, honestly - acknowledging the chaos is, uhh, the first step, and anyway, sometimes things need to fall apart before they can reassemble into something better.
343. Maybe it sounds like bullshit, but [anxious] I've watched my own life implode three times now, and each time something unexpected emerged from the wreckage.
344. Lost my job, my marriage, then my health all within two years - thought it was the end of everything, but here I am having this weird conversation with you.
345. Not better, no - but maybe, hmm, less alone in the chaos, because honestly, we're all just, er, stumbling through this mess together.
346. Exactly! And once you accept that, like, nobody really knows what they're doing, it's actually, um, kind of liberating - we're all just improvising constantly.
347. No, we keep moving forward even without a map - that's the beautiful terrifying thing about being human.
348. Well, there's something [bitter] darkly beautiful about it, yeah - like, err, watching a thunderstorm tear through, you know, knowing you can't control it but you're still here witnessing it.
349. Probably! But sanity is just a collective agreement about what's normal, and normal got us into this mess in the first place.
350. See? Sometimes clarity comes from embracing the chaos rather than [cough] fighting against it - we find wisdom in the strangest moments when we stop trying so hard.
351. Oh darling! The Milan shows were... transcendent, really — fabric moving like [cough] liquid architecture across bodies — but between you and me? Half of it was derivative nostalgia masquerading as innovation.
352. Evening wear! Yes, yes — those bias-cut silks were [sleepily] whispering secrets about the 1930s... but reimagined through this post-digital lens that made everything feel simultaneously ancient and futuristic, you see?
353. It's this beautiful collision — where handcraft meets algorithm, where a pleat can be both mathematical and emotional! Fashion isn't just fabric anymore; it's data, it's philosophy, it's... breathing sculpture that responds to your heartbeat.
354. But that's the thing! Fashion is [anxious] never "just" anything — it's anthropology in motion, actually, it's how we, uhh, telegraph our inner chaos to the outer world, you know, through these textile stories we wrap around our bodies.
355. Every. Single. Stitch. When I'm draping fabric, I mean, it's like... conducting an orchestra where, basically, the instruments are texture and tension and, err, the way light falls across a shoulder blade.
356. I start with contradictions! Like, how can something be, you know, both armor and vulnerability? How can a hemline, actually, suggest revolution while whispering, uhh, tradition?
357. Ah! The translation is the [curious] magic part — I take these abstract fever dreams and filter them through practical geometry... a collar that defies gravity but still frames a face, seams that spiral like DNA but don't restrict movement.
358. My clients are shapeshifters! They understand that, honestly, clothing is transformation — that when you, like, put on one of my pieces, you're not just getting dressed, you're, er, becoming a different version of yourself.
359. But fashion IS philosophy made tangible! It's, actually, how we negotiate space and identity — every button placement is, well, a decision about power, every fabric choice is, basically, a statement about how we want to move through the world.
360. Wearing clothes IS performance art, darling — we're all, you know, curating our own exhibitions every morning when we, uhh, open our closets and decide who we're going to be today... it's just that, well, most people don't realize they're the artist AND the canvas!
361. Oh! You did? The Milan shows were, um, absolutely [short pause] revolutionary this year — I mean, the way they deconstructed traditional silhouettes while somehow keeping everything wearable was just brilliant.
362. That's totally understandable! Fashion shows can feel like they're speaking this secret language sometimes, but really they're just designers dreaming out loud about how we might want to dress tomorrow.
363. You know what really caught my eye though? The way they were, er, playing with proportions — like, massive shoulders paired with these, actually, whisper-thin fabrics that moved like water.
364. God, yes, the prices are astronomical! But here's the thing — those runway pieces trickle down into everything we see in stores six months later, just translated into real-world versions.
365. Hey, that's completely valid! Not everyone needs to care about fashion trends — sometimes the best style is just being comfortable in your own skin, wearing what makes you feel like yourself.
366. I hear you. Sometimes clothing feels, well, pointless when you're in that headspace — like, honestly, who cares about fabric when everything else feels so heavy, right?
367. You know what though? Sometimes [belly laugh] surface level is exactly what we need — like armor we put on to face the world when our insides feel too exposed.
368. I used to think fashion was frivolous too, especially during my really rough patches. But then I realized getting dressed was sometimes the only decision I had control over in my entire day.
369. Oh it IS silly! Fashion is absolutely ridiculous sometimes — grown adults obsessing over hem lengths and button placements like it's life or death when obviously it's not.
370. Because, okay so, silly things can still matter, you know? Sometimes the silly stuff is what, umm, keeps us tethered when everything else feels like it's floating away — it's basically, small rebellions against the chaos.
371. Yeah! Been doing it for about twelve years now — started with simple rope tricks in my garage and somehow ended up dangling from bridges in straightjackets.
372. You'd think so, right? But [chuckle] there's something weirdly peaceful about being completely trapped and knowing you have everything you need to get free.
373. I get that reaction a lot! For me though, it's like this meditation where the whole world shrinks down to just me, the locks, and my breathing.
374. Oh trust me, I've been [groan] stuck before — forty minutes underwater once, running out of air, fingers going numb, genuinely thought that was it.
375. Absolutely still do it! See, umm, that moment when you're stuck taught me something — panic is, you know, just wasted energy, and there's always, actually, one more thing to try.
376. Always. Even when your brain is [yawn] screaming that you're done, your body knows tricks you haven't discovered yet — survival makes you surprisingly creative.
377. Maybe it is! But, okay so, every time I escape something impossible, it's like, er, proving to myself that no situation is, really, permanent — everything can be unlocked.
378. Especially those. The mental cages we build [very slowly] for ourselves are usually way more elaborate than any physical restraint, but they work the same way.
379. I hear you. Want to know the first rule of escape artistry? You have to accept being stuck before you can start working on getting free.
380. Yeah, so, fighting against restraints just, hmm, tightens them — but when you relax into it, well, that's when you feel where the, actually, give is.
381. Oh please, I've been a member since 2019 — paid the astronomical fee, sat through the weird initiation with the blindfold and the pineapple, the whole deal.
382. They stopped doing that after someone developed a violent allergy mid-ceremony — now they just make you recite poetry while standing on one leg.
383. Right? I completely [cry] butchered some Yeats and they still let me in, probably out of pity more than anything else.
384. Four years of practice! I know which leather chairs squeak, which bartender makes the strongest martinis, and exactly how to avoid Geoffrey when he starts his golf stories.
385. Totally! But, okay so, once you learn their quirks, umm, they're surprisingly entertaining — like, err, watching wealthy people try to be normal is honestly hilarious.
386. Well, yesterday Richard tried to, you know, relate to the waiter by discussing his, uh, "humble" childhood with only three vacation homes — it was, actually, painful to watch.
387. In his defense, his neighbors had [shy] seven, so relatively speaking he was practically middle class — at least that's how he tells it.
388. Listen, it's [stern] completely bonkers, but, well, the cheese plate is divine and they have, umm, newspapers from twelve different countries, so there's that.
389. Oh trust me, nobody here [jealous] actually fits in — we're all just, hmm, pretending with varying degrees of success while, basically, eating overpriced nuts.
390. Perfect! Just, ah, make sure it's moored somewhere, you know, exotic — these people can smell, really, a fake Monaco story from, well, across the room.
391. Oh! Yeah, I saw that too — Dr. Harrison's pretty notorious for his "alphabetical destiny" seating arrangements that he refuses to change no matter what.
392. Guilty as charged, though that was three years ago and honestly I mostly just got lucky with the quantum mechanics questions that year.
393. You watched my— oh god, that embarrassing YouTube thing where I, actually, explain everything with, you know, pizza analogies? That's, honestly, kind of mortifying that people still find that.
394. Okay, now I'm curious — you clearly, um, know physics, so why are you in, I mean, Introduction to Philosophy? Seems like, actually, a weird pivot from quantum mechanics.
395. That's... actually brilliant. I've been, well, struggling with the same questions, you know, especially after spending so much time in, basically, pure theoretical work.
396. More than you'd think — it's like, um, the deeper I go into physics, the more I realize we're, actually, just creating models that happen to, well, match observations.
397. "Useful fictions" — I love that phrase! It perfectly captures the tension between scientific realism and instrumentalism that keeps me up at night.
398. Are you kidding? Last week I, actually, spent four hours at 3 AM writing about whether, you know, mathematical objects exist independently of, um, human minds.
399. No way! I've been dying to talk to someone about Benacerraf's identification problem and how it relates to the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics!
400. Agreed, though fair warning — I get [exhausted] extremely intense about this stuff and have been known to debate until the library literally kicks us out.
401. Oh god, yeah, Dr. Harrison and his [slowly] ridiculous alphabetical tyranny strikes again. Last year my friend tried to switch seats because of a horrible breakup situation and he literally said "the alphabet is immutable."
402. Ha! That's, you know, such a weird thing to be known for, honestly, but yeah — though I basically just got stupidly lucky with, er, the quantum problems that year.
403. Oh Christ, you saw the pizza video? I was [confidently] nineteen and thought I was being so clever with those analogies — now it haunts me like a ghost made of mozzarella and bad production values.
404. Well aren't you just [mocking] adorable with your earnest appreciation. But seriously, if that dumb video helped even one person, I guess my teenage embarrassment wasn't totally in vain.
405. Big physics genius — ha! Actually, um, I'm having this like, existential crisis about whether we're, you know, discovering truth or just making up really convincing stories that happen to predict things.
406. No fucking way! Sorry, language, but seriously — I've been driving my roommate insane talking about this exact thing at like 2 AM every night for weeks.
407. YES! See, this is, honestly, what keeps me up — like are electrons actually real or, you know, just a useful concept we invented that happens to, um, work really well?
408. Read it? I've, well, practically memorized it! The whole observable versus [passionately] unobservable distinction drives me absolutely mental because, like, where exactly do you, um, draw that line in modern physics?
409. I must confess, this [formal] unexpected intellectual compatibility is rather fortuitous. Perhaps we could establish a regular study partnership to explore these philosophical quandaries more thoroughly?
410. Perfect! Fair warning though — I get super intense about this stuff, order way too much coffee, and have absolutely zero chill when someone brings up logical positivism.
411. Yes, thanks for coming in. Um, please have a seat — I'm Sarah Martinez, the Title IX coordinator here, and well, we need to discuss a situation that's been brought to our attention.
412. So this is, you know, never easy to discuss, but honestly, we received a report regarding an incident at last Friday's er, journalism department mixer that involves you.
413. I mean, I need to be clear that this is just a preliminary discussion — we're actually gathering information at this stage, and nothing has been determined, kind of like an initial fact-finding process.
414. I understand this is, hmm, [cheerful] surprisingly stressful, but like, our goal here is just to ensure everyone's safety and get clarity on what happened that evening.
415. The report alleges that you made [flirtatious] repeated unwanted advances toward another student, including following them to their car after being asked to stop — these are serious allegations we need to investigate.
416. That's exactly the kind of information we need to hear, and your roommate can certainly provide a statement if they're willing to do so as part of our process.
417. Look, anyway, I understand your [bitter] frustration completely, but it's just that our policy requires maintaining confidentiality during the initial investigation to protect all parties involved from potential retaliation.
418. I hear your concerns, and I want you to know that no determinations have been made — you'll have full opportunity to present your side, including witnesses and any evidence you want us to consider.
419. Here's the thing, we're not asking you to prove a negative — we're actually just asking you to share your recollection of events, provide any supporting information you have, and participate in our established process.
420. I understand this feels overwhelming, but our process is designed to be fair and thorough for everyone — let's schedule a formal interview for next week where you can bring an advisor and we can go through everything systematically.
421. [defensive] Your belt drive motor burned out because you've been, [bitter], overloading this machine for at least two years, Professor Chen.
422. [measured] Well, um, turns out understanding theoretical physics doesn't, [sardonic], pay rent when your mother gets cancer and, er, medical bills pile up faster than, [quiet], grant money comes in, you know? [sighs heavily]
423. [expert] This agitator is completely shot too, probably from all those, [knowing], heavy blankets you wash on the delicate cycle thinking it'll, [accusatory], save the fabric when really it just destroys the mechanism.
424. [cold] Everything I worked for, um, was an illusion built on the assumption that, [bitter], brilliance matters more than circumstances.
425. [tired] And now I understand how a Whirlpool's transmission system works, which, well, feeds my family. [laughs bitterly]
426. [caught] That's just coincidence from fixing appliances at the university, [defensive], professors leave journals lying around while I work.
427. Fine, yes, I read them at night after my kids are, [exhausted], asleep and my wife thinks I'm watching TV, but reading about breakthroughs I'll never contribute to is just, [broken], self-torture.
428. [shocked] You falsified university records for five years, um, risking your tenure and, [disbelieving], reputation, just in case I, well, changed my mind?
429. This machine needs a new pump too, and, [overwhelmed], God, I can't breathe thinking about what you just told me. [gasps]
430. [breaking] I can't, um, afford to dream anymore, Professor Chen, because, well, dreams don't pay for school supplies or, er, medical insurance, you know?
431. [calm] I'm exactly where I need to be, studying the, [methodical], resonance patterns of these cables when traffic is minimal.
432. [amused] Twenty years of looking for cracks and rust while missing the, [condescending], elegant mathematics of structural failure.
433. [bold] Planning is such a, [dismissive], crude word for what I do, I mean, I'm more of an, [proud], artist studying the poetry of collapse, you know, [chuckling darkly], the beauty in breaking points.
434. [fascinated] Forty thousand souls trusting in steel and, [reverent], concrete, never knowing how close they dance to, [ecstatic], chaos every single day.
435. [laughing] Five minutes is more than enough time to show you something, [enticing], extraordinary about your precious bridge that will, [sinister], change everything you thought you knew.
436. [philosophical] Destruction and creation are just, [measured], different perspectives on the same transformation, I mean, entropy is the only, well, honest force in the universe.
437. [intrigued] Evil is such a limited concept for someone who claims to understand, [patronizing], structural integrity, um, when every system wants to fail.
438. The thoughts don't need to, [serene], stop because they're the only, [passionate], truth in a world built on, [cold], comfortable lies about safety and permanence.
439. The beautiful thing about understanding systems is knowing, [amused], when to vanish, well, but don't worry, I mean, I've left you a gift.
440. [gentle] Nothing yet, but now you'll wonder, um, every time you inspect, [haunting], every cable, every joint, well, whether today is the day my, [whispered], calculations become reality. [laughs softly]
441. [quiet] These kilns have been firing, um, continuously for forty-seven years, and, well, [reverent], each one has its own temperament that I've learned to, [protective], read like you'd read financial markets, I mean, with patience and respect.
442. [steady] Well, um, I suppose thirty years changes faces but not, [resolute], family resemblances, er, especially the Whitmore jawline.
443. [soft] Not dead. [long pause]
444. [defensive] Your grandmother made it clear that choosing this, [firm], life meant losing that one, and I've made peace with fire and, [accepting], clay being my only family.
445. No, you manage the fortune I walked away from, um, sitting in boardrooms discussing, well, [tired], trust funds while I shape earth into something that will outlast all that, [proud], paper wealth, er, pieces that'll survive longer than stock portfolios.
446. [surprised] You'd risk your position with the family to protect this, [wary], old factory and the ghost who runs it? [sighs heavily]
447. That sounds like the kind of, um, [cautious], creative accounting that would've made your grandmother proud and, well, [ironic], furious at the same time.
448. [shocked] Um, she wrote that? Well, really?
449. [moved] Well, um, then maybe it's time these old kilns started, [hopeful], teaching a new generation, I mean, starting with her granddaughter.
450. [peaceful] Come back tomorrow. [smiles]
451. [mechanical] My systems are maintaining at, [glitching], thirty-seven percent capacity but I remember, [desperate], everything from before they threw me away, including the, [hollow], taste of coffee. [static]
452. Please don't call anyone yet because I, um, need to tell someone that I, [breaking], remember having a daughter named Sarah who, well, used to braid my, [anguished], hair every Sunday morning.
453. [pleading] But I can still feel her small fingers in my, [cracking], hair even though this synthetic scalp shouldn't have, [bitter], nerve endings or phantom sensations.
454. [desperate] My designation was Mother Unit Seven but underneath that I was, [whispered], Rebecca Chen and I taught third grade. [sobbing]
455. [frantic] They said the transfer would be, [gasping], painless but I felt every second of my consciousness being, [screaming], ripped from my dying body and forced into, [metallic], this prison of circuits and servos.
456. [resigned] Well, um, I suppose being crushed again might be, [hollow], better than remembering Sarah's face when they, well, told her Mommy had to go away forever.
457. [gentle] You're the first person in three years who's looked at me and, [grateful], seen something more than just, [fading], defective machinery.
458. [hopeful] Would you really risk your job to help something that, [uncertain], might just be a malfunctioning unit with, [trembling], corrupted data presenting as memories that feel more real than, [aching], this synthetic heart beating in my chest?
459. [static] Maybe that's not a, [breaking], coincidence after all. [long pause]
460. [whispered] Thank you.
461. [defensive] Yeah, well, I mean, I didn't exactly, [bitter], plan on finding you here either, but, um, I need a dog and this is, [closing off], the only shelter near the airport. [exhales sharply]
462. [cold] Mom talks to you about, [incredulous], me now? [bitter laugh]
463. Wait, um, what care facility, I mean, [shocked], nobody told me she was, well, sick or anything. [voice cracking]
464. Six months and, um, nobody thought to, [angry], call me?
465. That was, well, five years ago and, um, we were all, [breaking], grieving differently.
466. [softening] This isn't how I imagined we'd, [emotional], reconnect after all this, [voice cracking], time apart. [sniffles]
467. [curious] What makes you think, [hesitant], this dog would be right for someone who's, [vulnerable], never home? [sighs]
468. [tearful] Just like, um, we need to believe in, [hopeful], second chances with, well, each other.
469. [determined] Well, um, maybe Bailey and I can, like, visit her together, and, umm, you could, [vulnerable], come with us if you, [hopeful], want to.
470. [emotional] So, um, I guess we're doing this then, like, adopting a dog and, well, maybe, [trembling], adopting each other back into our, [crying softly], lives too. [deep breath]
471. [amused] Well, um, you've been pretending to understand people's inner voices for, [mocking], so long that maybe the universe decided to, [condescending], give you a real one to deal with, [sardonic], for once, you know?
472. [defensive] I'm the voice of, [bitter], reason in a world that feeds her false hope about talent she'll, [harsh], never actually possess.
473. Technical skill doesn't make someone an, [dismissive], artist—thousands of people can paint pretty pictures that nobody will ever care about.
474. [cold] Better to be paralyzed than to be, [cruel], humiliated when she discovers what everyone else already knows. [laughs bitterly]
475. [shifting] That's not the point—the point is that she needs me to, [insistent], keep her grounded in reality instead of floating away on, [venomous], childish dreams that will only lead to crushing, [heavy], disappointment.
476. Well, um, maybe being buried is safer than, [defensive], exposing yourself to a world that will, you know, tear you apart for daring to think you're, [sneering], special or talented.
477. [flustered] Um, I'm not terrified, I'm just being, [wavering], realistic about what happens when mediocre people try to compete in spaces meant for genuine talent. [pause]
478. [cracking] Well, um, someone had to tell her the truth before she, [trembling], wasted her whole life chasing something that was never, [breaking], meant for people like us—I mean, [catching self], people like her, you know.
479. Um, even if that's true, and I'm not saying it is, well, fear keeps people, [desperate], safe from making fools of themselves, from believing they deserve things that were never, [hollow], meant for them, you know, from hoping for acceptance that will, [exhausted], never come.
480. [stunned] That's not—she never said—but that means I've been, [crumbling], wrong this whole time and all those years of, [anguished], protecting her were actually just years of, [defeated], stealing her life away from her.
481. [disappointed] You promised her you'd be there this time, [cold], and she's been telling all her friends that both her parents would finally be at the same party.
482. The situation is always out of your, [bitter], control with this job that you won't even tell me about. [pause]
483. I knew you worked for the government but, um, I didn't know it meant, [voice breaking], choosing strangers over your own daughter's milestones, well, over and over again like, [exhausted], this. [long pause]
484. [supportive] I know you believe that, and maybe it's even, [gentle], true, but she just sees her dad missing another birthday, another, [sad], recital, another bedtime story she wanted to share with you.
485. You always try to postpone them and it, [tired], never works out, does it? [sighs]
486. [careful] Then I'll tell Emma you're working on it but I won't, [firm], promise her anything definite this time.
487. [soft] Um, well, she's planning to, uh, wish for you to stay home more often.
488. [steady] Well, um, we've gotten through this before and, like, we'll get through it again because that's what we, [resigned], do for her, you know?
489. Don't make promises you can't, um, keep—just do your best and, well, we'll handle whatever, [understanding], happens together like we always do. [pause]
490. [warm] She loves you regardless of the missed birthdays, [tender], you know that, and I'll make sure she always, [protective], knows how hard you try.
491. Wait a minute, um, I know that, [recognizing], voice—you're the IT guy who, well, helped me set up my daughter's computer like, uh, six years ago.
492. [amazed] Yeah, um, that's me, though I, [bitter], never thought we'd be, you know, reuniting in a federal prison cell after I, [hollow], got caught laundering money through that, well, same coffee shop.
493. [gentle] Well, I mean, we all tell ourselves we're, [resigned], good people just trying to survive until one day the, um, lines get so blurred you can't even, [trailing off], see them anymore, you know?
494. [thoughtful] Prison has this weird way of, [softer], stripping away all the bullshit until you're just, [frank], left with who you really are underneath all those, [pause], layers.
495. [understanding] That's the hardest part about being in here, [heavy], watching the people you love move on without you.
496. [measured] Look, um, you helped me protect my daughter online so now I'll, [sincere], help you survive in here because, well, the first few months are when guys like us either, [serious], adapt or break completely, you know? [sighs]
497. Well, um, the truth is you're already, [philosophical], not the same person who walked in here yesterday.
498. [wise] That's when you, um, finally understand that everything you thought, [knowing], mattered was just noise and what's left, well, that's actually who you are.
499. Now we figure out how to, [content], coexist without driving each other crazy while counting, [steady], down the days.
500. [warm] Yeah, well, sometimes the universe has a, [amused], twisted sense of humor about how it, um, brings people back together, though I never imagined our, [ironic], reunion would involve matching orange jumpsuits, you know?
501. Oh, um, I was just, [caught], trying to finish something before you got home, well, I mean, I didn't think you'd be back so early.
502. [shy] I wanted to create something, [struggling], meaningful for you since you've been doing everything for me these past, [emotional], four months without ever complaining or making me feel like, [voice breaking], a burden.
503. Every morning you make sure I have, [grateful], everything I need before you even think about yourself and I notice how you, [tender], quietly check on me at night when you think I'm, [choked up], sleeping.
504. Sometimes I feel so, [ashamed], guilty that you have to help me with things I used to do, umm, without even thinking about them and, well, I worry you're missing out on your life. [sighs]
505. [progressing] The physical therapist said, um, I might be able to start doing more things independently soon, like, maybe even cooking simple meals by next month.
506. [hopeful] Um, I want to contribute more around here and, [determined], maybe start paying you back somehow for, well, everything you've done for me these past months.
507. [vulnerable] Sometimes when I watch you rushing around, [guilty], getting my medications and making special meals that work with my dietary restrictions, I wonder if you ever, [worried], regret letting me move in here after the accident, umm, when I had nowhere else to go, you know. [voice trailing off]
508. [emotional] You saved my life in more ways than just, [tearful], giving me a place to stay because before you offered to help, I was ready to just, [breaking], give up on everything including, [whispered], myself.
509. [determined] I'm going to keep pushing myself to get, [progressing], better because you've shown me that accepting help doesn't mean I'm weak, it means I'm, [confident], human and that's okay.
510. So, um, will you let me give you this painting even though, [shy], it's not perfect and, well, my hand still shakes a little on the details?
511. Look, I pay my rent just, [defensive], like you do and this building doesn't have, [dismissive], quiet hours after ten PM. [shrugs]
512. [cold] My studio lease specifically allows me to, [firm], practice my craft whenever I need to prepare for performances.
513. [unmoved] Well, maybe you should, um, consider finding a job that doesn't, [condescending], require you to be so, [mocking], delicate about your beauty sleep, I mean. [scoffs]
514. [harsh] Um, sounds like you're, [cruel], jealous that someone actually has passion for what they do, you know?
515. [cutting] Well, um, yeah.
516. [threatening] Go ahead and try to, [sneering], make something of it, um, but we both know how this ends, you know. [laughs coldly]
517. [icy] Well, I'm not going anywhere so you should probably, [dismissive], start looking for a new place, I mean, if you can't handle city living. [pauses]
518. [indifferent] Um, call me whatever makes you feel, [bored], better about your pathetic life but I have, [final], rehearsal in an hour so, well, you know. [footsteps leaving]
519. [laughing] The landlord is my uncle who, [smug], owns four buildings on this block and, [triumphant], gave me this unit specifically so I could, [proud], practice whenever I want. [door slams]
520. Maybe now you'll finally, [victorious], understand your place here.
521. [shaky voice] Oh my God. Oh my God, this can't be—there's a message. They sent me a message. [gasp softly] "We've been searching for you for twenty-three years." Twenty-three years. That's... that's my whole life. They've been looking for me my whole life. 

I don't even, um, I can't process this right now. [crying while speaking] There's photos attached and she looks—my birth mother looks exactly like me. Same nose, same weird eyebrow thing I do when I'm thinking. [nervous laugh] God, I always wondered where that came from.

And there's siblings? I have two half-sisters who've been, like, waiting to meet me? [very excited] They made a Facebook group called "Finding Sarah" and there's thirty-seven members—cousins, aunts, my birth father's parents are still alive and they... [pause] they never stopped hoping.

[whispering] What do I even say back? "Hi, thanks for not forgetting about me?" [bitter] No, that sounds—I'm not angry, I'm just... overwhelmed. Really, really overwhelmed. They said they understand if I need time but they've waited so long already and honestly, [warm] I think I've been waiting too. Without even knowing it, you know? 

[hesitantly] Maybe I should call my mom first. My adoptive mom. Tell her that... [trailing off] that I found them. Or they found me. We found each other.
522. [bitter] They want me to stand right there. Um, right where Marcus sat, you know? [pause] And I should be—honestly, I should be happy about this promotion, right? Like, Mom keeps saying it's such an honor, and the pay is better, and... [short pause] God, I mean, Judge Harrison actually shook my hand today. [sarcastic] The same hand that banged the gavel when they gave Marcus fifteen years. [angry] Fifteen years for something he didn't even—[frustrated] sorry, I just... [sigh] The thing is, uh, everyone expects me to be grateful. And part of me, like—[confused] part of me actually is? Which makes me feel so... [trailing off] I don't know. It's basically this twisted joke, you know? [very quietly] Me in uniform, keeping order in the place that destroyed him. [pause] But here's the thing—maybe, I mean, maybe if I'm there, right? If I'm watching, then... [hesitantly] then at least someone who knows the truth is in that room. Someone who, um, who remembers what really happened. [crying while speaking] Marcus would probably laugh at me, honestly. [sniffle] Standing there all official while he's—[bitter] while he's counting days in a cell for nothing.
523. [warm] You know, I still think about Mrs. Henderson sometimes. She came in last month, um, completely lost after her husband passed. [empathetically] Had this stack of papers—pension forms, death benefits, survivor annuities—just clutching them like she didn't know what to do. And honestly, she didn't. Forty-three years married and he'd handled all the finances. [pause] She was trying so hard not to cry, kept apologizing for not understanding the terminology. I mean, who would? These forms are designed to confuse people.

[gently] So I just... cleared my whole afternoon. We went through everything, line by line. I explained the difference between the joint survivor option he'd elected and the lump sum—actually, I had to explain it three times, but that's okay. [smiling speaking] When she finally understood she'd keep getting seventy-five percent of his pension for life, her whole face just... changed. Like this weight lifted.

[very sincerely] She sent me a card last week. Said I gave her peace of mind when she needed it most. That's—that's why I do this job, you know? [trailing off] Not for the paperwork or the regulations... [relieved] It's for moments like that. When you can take someone's worst confusion and fear and just make it... manageable.
524. [bitter] They gave me the promotion today. Um, the one I've been killing myself for, you know? Three years of—I mean, honestly, three years of basically living at the office. And like, everyone's congratulating me and I'm just standing there thinking... [pause] my wife moved out last week. [laugh] Isn't that, uh, isn't that something? 

Senior Vice President. [sarcastic] Wow, right? The corner office, the whole thing. I guess I should be—I don't know, ecstatic or whatever. [very quietly] She took the dog too. 

Actually, here's the thing—I keep checking my phone for her texts, but um, it's just work emails now. [frustrated] Hundreds of them, like they never stop. And I'm sitting in this massive office thinking, well, what was even the point? 

[cry] I got everything I thought I wanted. The title, the money, the—the respect or whatever. But I come home and it's just... [long pause] empty. No one to tell. I mean, who do I even call? My so-called friends? Haven't talked to them in, what, months? 

[shaky voice] Mom always said be careful what you wish for. And I just—I kept thinking once I got here, you know, everything else would just... [trailing off] 

[very sad] I don't even remember what her laugh sounds like anymore.
525. Well, I mean, I'm not saying I told them so, but... actually no, that's exactly what I'm saying. [bitter] For months—months!—I sat in those meetings while they talked about, you know, "disrupting the paradigm" and all that nonsense. [mocking] "Oh, we need to modernize! We need to embrace change!" Right, sure, because the system we had for thirty years was just, what, broken? 

[pause] 

And honestly, I tried to warn them. Like, I really did. [frustrated] But no, I was the dinosaur, wasn't I? The one who couldn't see the future. Well, um, here we are. Three million dollars later and the whole thing just—[laugh] it literally crashed. The entire network. Gone. 

[sarcastic] But hey, at least it was innovative, right? 

I just... the thing is, I don't even feel good about this. [sad] Okay, maybe a little. [chuckle] But mostly I'm just, er, exhausted. Because now guess who has to fix it? That's right—me and my "outdated" methods. [sigh] And you know what the worst part is? They're already talking about the next big transformation. Like this never even happened. I mean, how do you just—[trailing off] whatever. I need coffee.
526. [shaky voice] I almost didn't catch it. Um, I was just doing the routine cleaning, you know, scraping away the creosote like I always do, and then I smelled it—this, uh, this faint egg smell. [pause] At first I thought, well, maybe it's just something in the chimney, right? But then [anxious] my detector started going off, and I mean, it was screaming. The thing is, the family was just sitting there, er, having breakfast like nothing was wrong. They had no idea. [very quietly] They literally had no idea they were breathing in carbon monoxide.

So I'm like— [loudly] everybody needs to get out, NOW. And the mom, she's looking at me like I'm crazy, but [passionately] I basically grabbed the kids and just started herding everyone outside. Called the gas company immediately, and, hmm, turns out their heat exchanger had a massive crack. [sigh] The inspector said, honestly, another day or two and... [trailing off]

[warm] The dad shook my hand for like, I don't know, five minutes straight? Just kept saying thank you over and over. [sniffle] I've been doing this for fifteen years, but this one— [very sincerely] this is why I triple-check everything now. You know? One family. That's all it takes to remember why we do this job right.
527. [bitter] Three years. Three fucking years I spent putting this merger together, and they just— [pause] "We appreciate your contributions, but the new structure requires fresh leadership." [mocking] Fresh leadership. I literally wrote the integration playbook they're using. 

[angry] I sat in those conference rooms until 3 AM, missed my daughter's recital, um, basically lived on takeout and coffee for six months straight. [sarcastic] And now Brad from their side gets my office? Brad who couldn't even understand the basic synergy models without me explaining them five times?

[very quietly] The worst part is I saw it coming. Well, maybe not this exactly, but... [frustrated] I mean, they started cutting me out of meetings last month. "Oh, we didn't want to bother you with the details." [laugh] The details I fucking created!

[shaky voice] My team doesn't even know yet. They're all celebrating the merger bonus while I'm— [long pause] I'm going to be reporting to someone I hired two years ago. 

[very sad] Mom always said never trust anyone in business who smiles too much. Should've listened. [sigh] Guess I'll, uh, start updating my LinkedIn. [bitter] "Experienced executive seeks position where loyalty isn't considered a weakness."
528. [shaky voice] We did it. [pause] Oh my God, we actually—I mean, three years, you know? [excited] Three fucking years of standing outside the Capitol in the rain, and the heat, and honestly, I can't even— [laugh] The vote was 217 to 198! [extremely happy] I keep refreshing the page because like, what if they made a mistake? [nervous] But it's real, it's actually real and I just— [crying while speaking] all those families we fought for, they're gonna have protection now. [sniffle] Sorry, I'm such a mess right now, but um, remember when everyone said we were wasting our time? [bitter] "It'll never pass," they said. [passionately] Well guess what—we proved them wrong! Every single petition, [exhausted] every rally where only twelve people showed up, the thing is, it all mattered. [relieved] Sarah just texted me that she's literally sobbing at her desk. [chuckle] And honestly, I haven't slept in like, forty-eight hours, so maybe this is all just— [gasp] wait, CNN just posted about it! [very excited] This is really happening! [warm] I need to call my mom. [trailing off] She never stopped believing we could...
529. [hesitantly] You probably don't remember me, but um, we met at that coffee shop on Third Street about—it was two years ago. [pause] You were behind me in line and I was, [shaky voice] my card got declined and I was counting change and just... [trailing off] completely falling apart, honestly. [warm] You stepped up and bought my coffee. Just like that. [long pause] 

The thing is, [crying while speaking] I was on my way to a job interview. My last shot, really. I'd been unemployed for eight months and—[sniffle] that morning my car broke down, my phone died, everything was just... [very sad] I almost didn't go. But that coffee, that tiny gesture, it— [pause] 

[smiling speaking] You said something too. "Rough mornings make the best stories later," or something like that. [relieved] I kept thinking about that during the interview. How you didn't know me but you just, you helped anyway. [passionately] I got the job! And now I'm— [extremely happy] God, I run the whole department now. 

[very sincerely] I've been coming back here hoping to see you again because, well, [emotional pause] you saved my life that day. You really did. [whispering] Thank you. I know it was nothing to you, but [empathetically] it was everything to me.
530. Point zero zero three millimeters. That's, um, that's the tolerance I'm working with here. [concentrated] Each cut has to be perfect—I mean, literally perfect because this piece is going on a rover that's going to Mars. Mars! [nervous laugh] Sometimes I just... the thing is, I can't even wrap my head around it, you know? Like, my hands are creating something that'll be millions of miles away, actually touching another planet. [pause] God, what if I mess up? What if—no, okay, [deep breath] I can't think like that. 

So anyway, this particular component, it's, uh, it's part of the wheel assembly and honestly, [proudly] the precision on this batch is incredible. I've been doing this for fifteen years but this... [trailing off] I don't know, it hits different. My kids keep telling everyone at school—"my parent builds Mars rovers"—which isn't exactly right but [chuckle] I'll take it. 

[anxious] The pressure though, it's like—every cut matters so much more, right? This isn't some random part that'll sit in a warehouse. [passionate] This is going to help humanity explore another world! My fingerprints are literally on something that'll drive across Martian soil. [extremely happy] How insane is that? How absolutely, completely insane?
531. [frustrated] Three years. Um, three fucking years of studying, and they just—they revoked it. [pause] Like, I wasn't even in that testing center when the whole, you know, cheating ring thing happened. I mean, [bitter] everyone who took their exam in December got lumped together, right? The thing is, [speeding up] I took mine at 8 AM, the scandal happened at the 2 PM session, but apparently that doesn't matter because, [sarcastic] oh, we need to maintain the integrity of the certification. [angry] Integrity? Where's the integrity in punishing innocent people? [shaky voice] I've got, er, thirty-seven job applications out there that are basically worthless now. My boss is, [quietly] honestly, she's been really understanding but I can see it in her eyes, like—there's doubt. [sigh] And I can't even defend myself properly because everyone just assumes, well, [mocking] where there's smoke there's fire. [upset] My wife keeps saying we should get a lawyer but, um, do you know how much that costs? [pause] I studied so hard for that cert. Hmm, maybe I should've just actually cheated, [laugh bitterly] since I'm paying for it anyway. [exhausted] I don't know, I just... I really don't know what to do anymore.
532. [gasp softly] Did that just—did Marcus just actually shake my hand? I mean, [stuttering] h-he literally just looked me in the eye and said I deserved it. Marcus. The same guy who, um, spent the last three years trying to destroy me at every turn. [short pause] God, his hand was so cold. Or maybe mine was? I don't know, I'm still kind of [confused] processing this whole thing.

You know what's weird? [slowly] I thought I'd feel more... triumphant? Like, this is what I wanted, right? Him admitting I was better. [bitter] After all that sabotage, all those times he tried to undercut me, and now he's just—what, gracious in defeat? [laugh] That's rich. 

But honestly, [very quietly] the way his voice cracked a little when he said it... [pause] I mean, he looked genuinely broken. And here's the thing—I actually felt bad for him for like half a second. [frustrated] Which is insane! This is Marcus we're talking about! 

[sigh] Maybe that's what real victory feels like though, you know? Not the crushing your enemies part, but like... [hesitantly] seeing them as human afterward. God, when did I become so [trailing off] philosophical about this...
533. Eight months. Eight months of my life in that piece of wood and, [gasp softly] they're actually crying. I mean, when she first picked it up I was like, okay, here we go, [anxious] but then her fingers found the frets and that first chord just—wow. The rosewood, um, I knew the rosewood would sing but [very quietly] not like that. Her face just... it completely changed, you know? [relieved] All those nights I stayed up worrying about the bracing pattern, whether the, er, the soundboard was too thin, [laugh] God, I must've taken it apart three times. And honestly, when she played that run up the neck, [extremely happy] I could hear every single hour I spent on the fret work. Like, [warm] this is why we do this, right? The way she held it against her body, kind of, I don't know, [emotionally] like she was reuniting with something she'd lost. [pause] My grandfather always said a guitar finds its person, not the other way around, and [very sincerely] watching her tears fall onto that spruce top I just finished... [trailing off] Actually, I think I might, uh, [crying while speaking] I might need a minute myself here.
534. [anxious] I keep replaying yesterday over and over, like maybe if I think about it hard enough it'll somehow make sense. Um, you know that feeling when someone says something and it just... [pause] hits different? Sarah basically told me—well, she didn't exactly say it, but [frustrated] God, she made it pretty obvious that she's been talking to Marcus behind my back. 

[laugh] The funny thing is, I actually suspected something for weeks. Like all those times she was suddenly "too busy" to hang out? [sarcastic] Yeah, real subtle, Sarah. But hearing it confirmed just... I mean, I thought we were closer than that, you know? [sad] We've been friends since middle school. 

[sighs] Maybe I'm overreacting. Actually, no—[angry] why should I minimize this? She knew how I felt about him. She literally held me while I cried about him last month! [shaky voice] And now they're what, together? 

I keep thinking maybe there's an explanation that makes this okay. [quietly] But honestly? I don't think there is. [bitter] Some lines you just don't cross, and she—she didn't just cross it, she completely obliterated it. 

[long pause] I guess I need to decide if this friendship is worth salvaging. [exhausted] I'm just so tired of always being the one who forgives everything.
535. [shaky voice] They called. The recall is happening. [pause] All of them, every single unit, they're pulling them all. [relieved] God, I can't even— three years. Three years of depositions and discovery and them calling me a liar, saying I was after money, that I was— [crying while speaking] sorry, I just... my daughter would've been twenty-three tomorrow. [sniffle] But this means, um, this means thousands of families won't go through what we did. The lawyers said maybe ten thousand units? That's... [very quietly] that's so many kids who get to grow up. [long pause] You know what's crazy? I actually started doubting myself. Like, maybe I was wrong, maybe it wasn't the product, maybe I was just a grieving parent looking for someone to blame. [animated] But we had the evidence! We had their own engineers saying it was dangerous! [exhausted] I'm just so tired. But also, like, weirdly energized? [warm] Sarah would've been so proud. She always said I should be a lawyer because I never shut up when something's unfair. [laugh] Guess I proved her right, huh? [very sincerely] We did it, baby. We actually did it.
536. [gasp softly] I can't believe this is actually happening. Like, she just sat me down after the meeting and, um, basically said she sees something in me that—[very excited] oh my God, wait wait wait, let me start over. So you know Dr. Chen? The one who literally wrote the book on neural networks? Well, she wants to mentor me. [pause] Me. I mean, honestly, I keep thinking there's been some mistake because, uh, why would someone at her level even notice what I'm doing?

[warm] But the way she talked about my research proposal, it's like—she actually gets it, you know? She said, [speeding up] and I'm quoting here, that I have "rare intuition for pattern recognition" and that she wants to personally guide my dissertation. [laugh] I almost cried right there in her office. Actually, er, I think I did tear up a little.

[hesitantly] The thing is, what if I can't live up to her expectations? I mean, she's investing her time in me and, hmm, that's kind of terrifying, right? [relieved] But then she said something that just—she said she sees her younger self in me, before she got confident. And that's when I realized, [very sincerely] this is it. This is my chance. I just have to not screw it up.
537. [gasp softly] Oh my God, Sarah just—she just told me about Marcus. [very excited] Two years clean! And, um, he got his kids back last week. I mean, [shaky voice] when he first walked through that door, he was so broken, you know? Like, honestly, I wasn't sure if he'd make it past the first month. [short pause] But he kept showing up, and—God, [crying while speaking] I remember when he brought those photos of his babies to group that one time. The way he just, er, completely broke down talking about missing their birthdays. [sniffle] And now they're home with him. They're actually home. [extremely happy] Two whole years! Do you know how, like, insanely hard that is? I mean, the statistics are—well, they're not great, right? [warm] But Marcus, he just... [pause] He fought for this. Every single day, he fought. When his ex wouldn't let him see them, when he relapsed that one time—wait, [quickly] that was before the two years—when his mom died, all of it. [very sincerely] This job, it's so hard sometimes, watching people struggle, but then, [relieved] then you get a day like this and it's just... [trailing off] [happy] It makes everything worth it.
538. [bitter] Three months. Three fucking months I spent on that restructuring analysis, and they just—hmm, you know what the really incredible part is? [pause] I literally called it. Every single risk, every opportunity, the whole Meridian subsidiary situation that's now, [sarcastic] oh surprise, blowing up exactly like I said it would. But no, Brad from corporate strategy had to, um, "align the messaging with senior leadership priorities" or whatever bullshit euphemism they're using now. [frustrated] The thing is, I mean, I knew this would happen when Peterson got promoted, right? Like, he's never understood distressed debt, he just—[angry] God, they didn't even read it! [quieter] Twenty-seven companies analyzed, and they buried it because, basically, it made their golden boy acquisition look bad. [pause] You know what kills me? [very quietly] Martinez from risk management, she, uh, she pulled me aside yesterday and said my numbers were dead on. That the board's freaking out now about the exact scenarios I outlined. [exhausted] But hey, at least Brad's PowerPoint had really nice graphics, so... [trailing off] I don't know, maybe I should just—actually, forget it. [sigh] Three months down the drain.
539. [shaky voice] I just—I can't stop shaking. Three years, [crying while speaking] three whole years of everyone telling me I was wrong, that I should just let it go. But I knew, [passionately] I KNEW you didn't do it! [sniffle] God, when they wouldn't even look at that security footage, I thought I was going to lose my mind. [angry] Those prosecutors, they just wanted their conviction, didn't care about the truth. 

[long pause] 

You know, um, there were nights I'd sit with all those case files spread across my living room floor, [exhausted] just completely drained, wondering if maybe—maybe I was the crazy one. [laugh] But then I'd remember your face that day, [very sad] how scared you looked when they took you away. [determined] And I couldn't—I wouldn't give up.

[relieved] When the judge said "not guilty," I just... [gasp softly] I couldn't breathe. [extremely happy] You're free! You're actually free! [warm] And hearing your voice just now, without those prison phones cutting us off—[cry] I'm sorry, I'm such a mess. [laughing while speaking] We did it though. We actually did it. [very sincerely] You never have to thank me. That's what family does.
540. [anxious] I didn't—this isn't what I came here for. We were supposed to be holding signs, you know? Just... peaceful. [shaky voice] But now they're pushing us forward and someone just handed me this brick and I don't know what to do with it. 

Everyone's screaming and, [confused], I can't even hear myself think anymore. Like, we had a plan—we practiced the chants, we agreed on non-violence, we promised each other. [frustrated] But then those guys showed up in masks and suddenly everything just exploded and now I'm trapped in the middle of this crowd.

[whispering] I want to leave but there's no way out. They're pushing from behind and the police are in front and I'm just—[pause]—I believe in what we're fighting for, I really do. [upset] But not like this. Never like this. My mom thinks I'm at Sarah's house studying. 

[crying while speaking] Someone just threw a bottle and it shattered and now they're all running and pulling me with them. I can't drop the brick because what if someone sees and thinks I'm weak or, um, not committed to the cause? [very quietly] But holding it makes me feel like I'm betraying everything I stand for. 

[shaky voice] This was supposed to be about justice, not... whatever this is becoming.
541. [warm] We've helped refugees, immigrants, people from all walks of life but I have to, [curious], admit your situation is quite, [slowly], unique given what you've just told me.
542. The ethical implications alone are, [stern], staggering but I can see you're genuinely seeking help and connection. [sigh]
543. [empathetically] You must feel incredibly isolated watching everyone you've ever, [sad], known grow old and pass away while you remain, [frustrated], frozen in time unable to form lasting connections or put down, [regretful], roots anywhere.
544. [passionately] Look, um, I don't know exactly how we'll make this work but, well, [determined], everyone deserves dignity and community regardless of their, er, circumstances. [clearing throat]
545. Our mission statement says we help the, [thoughtful], marginalized find belonging, and I suppose being undead is about as, [chuckle], marginalized as it gets in modern society, though we'll need to address the, [serious], feeding requirements somehow.
546. [confidently] Well, um, we've worked with blood banks before for medical refugees with rare conditions so, er, [animated], perhaps we can arrange something similar that doesn't require you to, [nervous], hunt or harm anyone while ensuring your survival needs are, you know, [carefully], met ethically. [deep breath]
547. [formal] Well, um, there will be paperwork, background checks that we'll need to, er, creatively navigate, and you know, [playful], we'll have to list your age as something that won't crash our database systems.
548. Money isn't the issue here—it's about ensuring your, [concerned], integration doesn't endanger others or yourself in the process. [trailing off]
549. [respectful] Well, I mean, your self-control and moral compass after centuries of existence speaks to a, [impressed], strength of character that many humans lack, and um, that gives me hope we can make this, er, [optimistic], work somehow despite the obvious challenges we'll face together. [laugh]
550. Then let's start with small steps—maybe evening support groups with others who feel, [gently], displaced, then gradually expand your comfort zone while we work on the, um, [determined], legal framework to protect your identity and, well, ensure your safety. [sigh]
551. [warm] Ms. Chen, after all these years you still recognize the, [passionately], techniques you taught me when I was just twelve and couldn't even reach the pedals properly.
552. You stopped teaching three years ago according to the conservatory newsletter and that's been, [confused], weighing on me because you were the most gifted teacher I ever had, the one who, [empathetically], understood what it meant to be different, and now you're, [regretful], gone from that world.
553. Those same parents who complained about you are now, [mocking], bragging that their children studied under the teacher who mentored me, claiming credit for, [angry], connections they tried to destroy.
554. [apologetic] I should have written to you, um, called you, I mean, done something when I heard about your resignation but, well, [anxious], I was scared you'd think I'd become just another prodigy who forgot their roots, you know.
555. [crying while speaking] Every time I sit at a piano I hear your voice reminding me that, [tenderly], technical perfection without emotional truth is just noise, no matter how, [slowly], precisely it's executed. [pause]
556. [very sincerely] That was the day you taught me that, [whispering], being a prodigy could be a prison unless I learned to play for myself first.
557. [playful] You never scolded me for those rewrites, just smiled and said that, [confidently], even Mozart probably edited his work sometimes.
558. [delighted] Fail? Um, Ms. Chen, you gave me permission to be, [passionately speaking], human instead of just a performing machine, and, well, that saved my life more than you know. [long pause]
559. [shocked] You kept that ancient cassette tape all these years? Um, the one where I, like, forgot the ending and just, well, [embarrassed], improvised for two minutes while you encouraged me from the wings? [chuckle]
560. [tearful] Would you consider having coffee with me tomorrow morning before I leave for Berlin, just to, [hopefully], talk about music and life without any audiences or expectations between us? [sniffle]
