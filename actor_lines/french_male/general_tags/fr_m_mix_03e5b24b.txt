=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: The Whitmore Foundation wants this property, [measured], liquidé d'ici la fin du trimestre, et j'ai besoin d'évaluer si les, [professional], fours ont une valeur de récupération au-delà de l'immobilier, [trailing off], lui-même—

Character 2 [mix]: [quiet] These kilns have been firing continuously for 47 years, et, bon, [reverent], chacun a son propre tempérament que j'ai appris à, [protective], lire comme tu lirais les marchés financiers, je veux dire, avec patience et respect.

Character 1 [mix]: You look exactly like the, [stunned], photos que grand-mère gardait cachées dans son bureau, celles de son fils qui a, [voice breaking], choisi l'argile plutôt que le droit des affaires.

Character 2 [mix]: [steady] Well, I suppose 30 years changes faces, mais pas les, [resolute], ressemblances familiales, euh, surtout la mâchoire des Whitmore.

Character 1 [mix]: [disbelief] Dad? Tu as été ici tout ce, [shaking], temps, juste à 20 miles du domaine, travaillant ces, [emotional], fours pendant qu'on te croyait mort?

Character 2 [mix]: [soft] Not dead. [long pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] Well, just gone then, parti alors.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Your grandmother made it clear, que choisir cette, [firm], vie signifiait perdre l'autre, et j'ai fait la paix avec le fait que le feu et, [accepting], l'argile soient ma seule famille.

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] I understand, je comprends.

Character 2 [mix]: No, you manage the fortune I walked away from, euh, assis dans des salles de réunion à discuter de, bon, [tired], fonds fiduciaires pendant que je façonne la terre en quelque chose qui survivra à toute cette, [proud], richesse de papier, euh, des pièces qui survivront plus longtemps que les portefeuilles d'actions.

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] Well, maybe there's another way to handle this liquidation, qui, [hopeful], préserve ce que tu as construit ici, je veux dire, quelque chose de créatif.

Character 2 [mix]: [surprised] You'd risk your position with the family, pour protéger cette, [wary], vieille usine et le fantôme qui la dirige? [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [mix]: [resolute] I'm thinking we could structure it as an artist residency program, sous l'initiative de préservation culturelle de la, [calculating], Fondation Whitmore, ce qui, euh, [warming], garderait les fours allumés et toi ici pour les faire fonctionner.

Character 2 [mix]: That sounds like the kind of creative accounting, euh, [cautious], qui aurait rendu ta grand-mère fière et, bon, [ironic], furieuse en même temps.

Character 1 [mix]: [gentle] She left me a letter before she died, disant que son plus grand, [emotional], échec n'était pas la fortune qu'elle avait bâtie mais le, [breaking], fils qu'elle a perdu par orgueil, l'artiste qu'elle ne pouvait pas, [tearful], pardonner d'avoir choisi la beauté plutôt que le devoir.

Character 2 [mix]: [shocked] She wrote that? Bon, elle a écrit ça? Vraiment?

Character 1 [mix]: [nodding] Every word, euh, chaque mot.

Character 2 [mix]: [moved] Well then, maybe it's time these old kilns started, [hopeful], à enseigner à une nouvelle génération, je veux dire, en commençant par sa petite-fille.

Character 1 [mix]: [laughing softly] I inherited her stubbornness, mais peut-être que je peux, [warm], apprendre ta patience, le genre qui attend que l'argile se transforme en, [thoughtful], quelque chose de permanent.

Character 2 [mix]: [peaceful] Come back tomorrow. [smiles]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: The Whitmore Foundation wants this property, [measured], liquidated by quarter's end, and I need to assess whether the, [professional], kilns have any salvage value beyond the real estate, [trailing off], itself—

Character 2: [quiet] These kilns have been firing, um, continuously for forty-seven years, and, well, [reverent], each one has its own temperament that I've learned to, [protective], read like you'd read financial markets, I mean, with patience and respect.

Character 1: You look exactly like the, [stunned], photographs grandmother kept hidden in her study, the ones of her son who, [voice breaking], chose clay over corporate law.

Character 2: [steady] Well, um, I suppose thirty years changes faces but not, [resolute], family resemblances, er, especially the Whitmore jawline.

Character 1: [disbelief] Dad? You've been here this, [shaking], entire time, just twenty miles from the estate, working these, [emotional], kilns while we thought you were dead?

Character 2: [soft] Not dead. [long pause]

Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, just gone then.

Character 2: [defensive] Your grandmother made it clear that choosing this, [firm], life meant losing that one, and I've made peace with fire and, [accepting], clay being my only family.

Character 1: [desperate] Um, I mean, I understand.

Character 2: No, you manage the fortune I walked away from, um, sitting in boardrooms discussing, well, [tired], trust funds while I shape earth into something that will outlast all that, [proud], paper wealth, er, pieces that'll survive longer than stock portfolios.

Character 1: [determined] Well, um, maybe there's another way to handle this liquidation that, [hopeful], preserves what you've built here, I mean, something creative.

Character 2: [surprised] You'd risk your position with the family to protect this, [wary], old factory and the ghost who runs it? [sighs heavily]

Character 1: [resolute] Um, I'm thinking we could structure it as, well, an artist residency program under the, [calculating], Whitmore Foundation's cultural preservation initiative, which would, er, [warming], keep the kilns firing and you here running them.

Character 2: That sounds like the kind of, um, [cautious], creative accounting that would've made your grandmother proud and, well, [ironic], furious at the same time.

Character 1: [gentle] She left me a letter before she died saying that her greatest, [emotional], failure wasn't the fortune she built but the, [breaking], son she lost to pride, the artist she couldn't, [tearful], forgive for choosing beauty over duty.

Character 2: [shocked] Um, she wrote that? Well, really?

Character 1: [nodding] Er, um, every word.

Character 2: [moved] Well, um, then maybe it's time these old kilns started, [hopeful], teaching a new generation, I mean, starting with her granddaughter.

Character 1: [laughing softly] I inherited her stubbornness but maybe I can, [warm], learn your patience, the kind that waits for clay to transform into, [thoughtful], something permanent.

Character 2: [peaceful] Come back tomorrow. [smiles]
