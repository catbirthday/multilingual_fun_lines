=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] God, I didn't expect to see, [voice breaking], you walking through that door after all these years, especially not, [trembling], here at the shelter.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Yeah, well, I mean, I didn't exactly, [bitter], plan on finding you here either, but, um, I need a dog and this is, [closing off], the only shelter near the airport. [exhales sharply]

Character 1 [en]: [careful] So, um, you're still flying then, I mean, Mom mentioned something about, [hesitant], international routes now, and, well, I guess that's, [trailing off], what you always wanted.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Mom talks to you about, [incredulous], me now? [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Sometimes she mentions things when, [softer], I visit her at the care facility.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, um, what care facility, I mean, [shocked], nobody told me she was, well, sick or anything. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] She had a stroke, [pained], six months ago.

Character 2 [en]: Six months and, um, nobody thought to, [angry], call me?

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] After what happened at Dad's funeral, [careful], nobody knew if you'd even pick up.

Character 2 [en]: That was, well, five years ago and, um, we were all, [breaking], grieving differently.

Character 1 [en]: [sympathetic] I know, and, um, I should have, [regretful], reached out sooner, but, well, pride is a terrible thing.

Character 2 [en]: [softening] This isn't how I imagined we'd, [emotional], reconnect after all this, [voice cracking], time apart. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] So, um, you said you need a dog, and, well, I have this golden retriever mix who's been, [warm], waiting for someone exactly, [meaningful], like you.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] What makes you think, [hesitant], this dog would be right for someone who's, [vulnerable], never home? [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [knowing] Because Bailey here survived, [tender], being abandoned twice and still believes in second chances.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] Just like, um, we need to believe in, [hopeful], second chances with, well, each other.

Character 1 [en]: Mom would be so, [emotional], happy to know we're talking again, even if it took, [bittersweet], a shelter dog to bring us, [choked up], back together.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Well, um, maybe Bailey and I can, like, visit her together, and, umm, you could, [vulnerable], come with us if you, [hopeful], want to.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] I'd really, [warm], like that.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] So, um, I guess we're doing this then, like, adopting a dog and, well, maybe, [trembling], adopting each other back into our, [crying softly], lives too. [deep breath]
