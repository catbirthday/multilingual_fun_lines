        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "They don't know about the piano lessons or the scholarship program you ran for twenty years without any recognition, using your own money when the estate started struggling. [softer] They just see property value."},

        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[deliberately] I see my teacher losing her home because I got good enough at spreadsheets to make it happen, and I see myself completing the assignment anyway because I have my own family to feed now."},
