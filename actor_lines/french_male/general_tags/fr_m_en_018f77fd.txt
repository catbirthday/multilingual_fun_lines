=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [disoriented] Wait, you're not with them, you're not one of the people who've been keeping me here for the past six days in this basement?

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] I've been with them for three weeks actually, building trust, learning their routines, waiting for the right moment to get you out safely without anyone getting hurt.

Character 1 [en]: You're lying.

Character 2 [en]: Your wife's maiden name is Harrison, your daughter just turned seven last month, and you have a scar on your left shoulder from a skiing accident in Aspen. [pause] Your company hired me.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked whisper] They hired you to, what, infiltrate these people? But they told me the company wouldn't pay, that they'd abandoned me completely.

Character 2 [en]: That's what we needed them to believe, because paying ransoms just creates more kidnappings, but leaving you here wasn't an option either. [quietly] I specialize in extractions.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] So I've been sitting here for six days thinking my own company considered me expendable, and the whole time you were, what, playing revolutionary upstairs?

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Playing revolutionary well enough that they trust me to bring you food, which means in about four minutes, you and I walk out that door together, nice and calm.

Character 1 [en]: Just like that? We just walk out and they won't notice their hostage is suddenly gone? [incredulous] That's your master plan?

Character 2 [en]: They're all watching the news upstairs because I made sure a certain story about government raids would break right about, [checks watch], now actually, which gives us a twelve-minute window.

Character 1 [en]: [urgently] But my face has been all over their propaganda videos, they've sent my picture to every cell in the network, so how do we get past—

Character 2 [en]: You're going out as my cousin Miguel who's been hiding in the basement workshop, and trust me, with this beard I've been growing you and these clothes, [sighs], nobody's looking twice.

Character 1 [en]: Miguel doesn't speak English.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Which is why you're going to keep your mouth shut and let me do all the talking while we walk three blocks to a van that's been parked there for two days.

Character 1 [en]: This is insane.

Character 2 [en]: Insane is sitting in this basement waiting for a government raid that'll end with bullets, so unless you have a better option, we need to move right now. [measured]

Character 1 [en]: [standing up shakily] God, I can barely walk straight after being chained to this pipe, but yeah, okay, let's do this before I lose my nerve completely.

Character 2 [en]: Lean on me like you're drunk, it'll explain the stumbling and give us a reason to leave early, plus it keeps your face turned away from anyone we pass. [exhales] Ready?

Character 1 [en]: [determined whisper] My daughter's birthday party is next weekend, and I swore I'd make it home for that, so yeah, I'm ready to trust whatever crazy plan you've got.

Character 2 [en]: [triumphant whisper] Then let's go give her the best present she could ask for—her parent walking through that door when she never thought she'd see you again. [pause] Time to move.
