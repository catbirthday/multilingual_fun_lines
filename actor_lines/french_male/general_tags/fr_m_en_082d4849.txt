=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Wait, I know that, [disbelief], voice—is that really you after, [shaky], all these years standing here in my terminal?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I didn't know you'd be working here, [tense], okay, so maybe we should just, uh, keep this professional.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Professional? You disappear for, [bitter laugh], eight years without a word, show up at, [voice breaking], my workplace, and now you want to talk about, [sarcastic], professional?

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Yes, because right now I've got, [measured], forty million dollars worth of cargo sitting on that ship that needs, [urgent], to clear customs before midnight or we're both, [stressed], completely screwed.

Character 1 [en]: You always did know how to, [frustrated], make everything about money instead of facing what you actually did to our family.

Character 2 [en]: [heated] Oh, so now you want to, um, do this here? Fine—I left because, [raw], well, staying meant watching Dad drink himself to death while you all, uh, pretended everything was perfect!

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] Don't you dare put this on, [furious], us! We stayed and fought through it while you, [voice cracking], ran away like a coward the moment things got, [quieter], hard!

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Fighting would have meant actually, [harsh], acknowledging there was a problem instead of enabling him every single day.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] You know what, um, maybe you're right about keeping this, [strained], professional because I don't think I can, uh, handle looking at you right now.

Character 2 [en]: The manifest numbers are, [mechanical], B-447 through B-492, all legitimate, all time-sensitive, all requiring your signature.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Yeah well, um, the thing is I could make this really, [vindictive], difficult for you right now—there are about, uh, fifteen different ways I could, [deliberate], delay your precious cargo.

Character 2 [en]: [warning] Don't even think about it—this isn't just, um, about me anymore, there are, uh, hundreds of jobs riding on this shipment. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: Jobs? Since when did you ever, [incredulous], care about anyone else's livelihood when you, um, walked away from your own family's business that, well, collapsed six months after you left?

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] I didn't know it would—look, um, I sent money back, every month for, uh, two years but Mom kept returning the checks unopened, so don't act like I didn't, well, try.

Character 1 [en]: Money? You thought sending, [disgusted], money would fix the fact that Mom cried herself to sleep every night wondering if you were even, um, alive? That Dad's last words were asking, uh, where his son was?

Character 2 [en]: He asked about me? When he was—God, I didn't, um, know he even remembered I existed after everything he said, [choked up], that night before I left, about how I was, well, no son of his. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [softer] Every single day, even when he couldn't, [emotional], remember our names, he'd ask if you'd called, if you were, [breaking], coming home for dinner.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] Please, I can't—just process the cargo and, um, let me go because if we keep talking like this, [desperate], I might actually believe there's still something here worth, uh, salvaging between us. [shaky breath]

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] Fine, I'll clear your shipment, but after this you need to, [firm], decide if you're actually back or if you're just, um, passing through again, because I can't do this—I mean, whatever this is—halfway.

Character 2 [en]: I'm, um, staying. [long pause]
