Scenario: A renowned orchestra conductor meets with the new board-appointed operations manager who wants to standardize the orchestra's avant-garde programming to match other symphony halls' traditional repertoires.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [accomplished] So, um, you're suggesting we abandon the, [incredulous], contemporary series that's taken fifteen years to, [strained], build because it doesn't match what other symphonies are, [exasperated], doing, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: [pragmatic] Well, um, essentially, yes.

Character 1 [en]: [controlled] I've spent, well, two decades cultivating an audience that trusts us to, [passionate], push boundaries, you know, not follow some corporate template.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] The board hired me to ensure financial, [careful], stability through proven programming models that work in seventeen other major halls.

Character 1 [en]: Art isn't about, um, replicating success formulas—it's about creating something that, [fierce], moves people beyond their comfort zones, you know. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [unmoved] That's very idealistic.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] And very successful. [scoffs]

Character 2 [en]: [clinical] Success means different things to donors who see our, [methodical], experimental programming as unnecessary risk when Beethoven fills seats reliably.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, we should just play the same hundred pieces every orchestra plays, well, because that's what's, [disgusted], safe and expected? [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [prudent] The data shows that traditional programming increases, [systematic], attendance by thirty-seven percent while reducing, [precise], operational costs by nearly half compared to commissioning, [triumphant], new works. [taps folder]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] You're killing us.

Character 2 [en]: I'm saving you.

Character 1 [en]: [weary] Every major breakthrough in classical music came from someone refusing to, [resigned], do what was expected, from Stravinsky causing riots to, [hollow], Glass being called noise, not from following, [defeated], spreadsheets.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Well, those pioneers, um, had patrons who could afford to, [practical], lose money on artistic experiments, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [rising] Our 'experiments' have won three international prizes and brought younger audiences into, [urgent], these halls than any traditional program ever, [desperate], has or will. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: Prizes don't pay musician salaries or keep the, [calculating], lights on when we're operating at a, [emphatic], seventeen percent deficit that grows every, [grave], season we continue this path. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] So we become another museum playing dead men's music to, [melancholic], dying audiences while real innovation happens in, [wistful], abandoned warehouses and streaming platforms where artists still, [trailing off], have freedom to create. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] We become sustainable, which means we, [steady], survive long enough to occasionally take risks instead of, [final], closing permanently next year. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [barely audible] There's no point in surviving if we're already, [broken], dead inside. [whispers]

Character 2 [en]: That's, um, a luxury, I mean, only the accomplished can afford to believe while the rest of us, [exhausted], deal with reality, you know, with the actual, [flat], numbers that determine whether this place exists tomorrow.
