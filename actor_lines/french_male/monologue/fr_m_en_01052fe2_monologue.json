[empathetically] Had this stack of papers—pension forms, death benefits, survivor annuities—just clutching them like she didn't know what to do. And honestly, she didn't. Forty-three years married and he'd handled all the finances. [pause] She was trying so hard not to cry, kept apologizing for not understanding the terminology. I mean, who would? These forms are designed to confuse people.\n\n[gently] So I just... cleared my whole afternoon. We went through everything, line by line. I explained the difference between the joint survivor option he'd elected and the lump sum—actually, I had to explain it three times, but that's okay. [smiling speaking] When she finally understood she'd keep getting seventy-five percent of his pension for life, her whole face just... changed. Like this weight lifted.\n\n[very sincerely] She sent me a card last week. Said I gave her peace of mind when she needed it most. That's—that's why I do this job, you know? [trailing off] Not for the paperwork or the regulations... [relieved] It's for moments like that. When you can take someone's worst confusion and fear and just make it... manageable."
