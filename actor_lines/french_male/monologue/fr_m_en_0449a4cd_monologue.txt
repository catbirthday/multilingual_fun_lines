Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] I almost didn't catch it. Um, I was just doing the routine cleaning, you know, scraping away the creosote like I always do, and then I smelled it—this, uh, this faint egg smell. [pause] At first I thought, well, maybe it's just something in the chimney, right? But then [anxious] my detector started going off, and I mean, it was screaming. The thing is, the family was just sitting there, er, having breakfast like nothing was wrong. They had no idea. [very quietly] They literally had no idea they were breathing in carbon monoxide.

So I'm like— [loudly] everybody needs to get out, NOW. And the mom, she's looking at me like I'm crazy, but [passionately] I basically grabbed the kids and just started herding everyone outside. Called the gas company immediately, and, hmm, turns out their heat exchanger had a massive crack. [sigh] The inspector said, honestly, another day or two and... [trailing off]

[warm] The dad shook my hand for like, I don't know, five minutes straight? Just kept saying thank you over and over. [sniffle] I've been doing this for fifteen years, but this one— [very sincerely] this is why I triple-check everything now. You know? One family. That's all it takes to remember why we do this job right.
