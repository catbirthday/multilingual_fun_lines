[sarcastic] The same hand that banged the gavel when they gave Marcus fifteen years. [angry] Fifteen years for something he didn't even—[frustrated] sorry, I just... [sigh] The thing is, uh, everyone expects me to be grateful. And part of me, like—[confused] part of me actually is? Which makes me feel so... [trailing off] I don't know.

If I'm watching, then... [hesitantly] then at least someone who knows the truth is in that room. Someone who, um, who remembers what really happened.
