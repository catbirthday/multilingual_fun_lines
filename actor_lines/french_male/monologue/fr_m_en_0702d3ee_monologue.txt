Speaker [en]: Point zero zero three millimeters. That's, um, that's the tolerance I'm working with here. [concentrated] Each cut has to be perfect—I mean, literally perfect because this piece is going on a rover that's going to Mars. Mars! [nervous laugh] Sometimes I just... the thing is, I can't even wrap my head around it, you know? Like, my hands are creating something that'll be millions of miles away, actually touching another planet. [pause] God, what if I mess up? What if—no, okay, [deep breath] I can't think like that. 

So anyway, this particular component, it's, uh, it's part of the wheel assembly and honestly, [proudly] the precision on this batch is incredible. I've been doing this for fifteen years but this... [trailing off] I don't know, it hits different. My kids keep telling everyone at school—"my parent builds Mars rovers"—which isn't exactly right but [chuckle] I'll take it. 

[anxious] The pressure though, it's like—every cut matters so much more, right? This isn't some random part that'll sit in a warehouse. [passionate] This is going to help humanity explore another world! My fingerprints are literally on something that'll drive across Martian soil. [extremely happy] How insane is that? How absolutely, completely insane?
