Speaker [en]: Eight months. Eight months of my life in that piece of wood and, [gasp softly] they're actually crying. I mean, when she first picked it up I was like, okay, here we go, [anxious] but then her fingers found the frets and that first chord just—wow. The rosewood, um, I knew the rosewood would sing but [very quietly] not like that. Her face just... it completely changed, you know? [relieved] All those nights I stayed up worrying about the bracing pattern, whether the, er, the soundboard was too thin, [laugh] God, I must've taken it apart three times. And honestly, when she played that run up the neck, [extremely happy] I could hear every single hour I spent on the fret work. Like, [warm] this is why we do this, right? The way she held it against her body, kind of, I don't know, [emotionally] like she was reuniting with something she'd lost. [pause] My grandfather always said a guitar finds its person, not the other way around, and [very sincerely] watching her tears fall onto that spruce top I just finished... [trailing off] Actually, I think I might, uh, [crying while speaking] I might need a minute myself here.
