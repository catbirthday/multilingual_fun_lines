Subject: The shy dove you've been mentoring just successfully mediated their first conflict resolution

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [excited] Oh my god, she did it! She actually did it! [warm] I mean, I knew she had it in her somewhere, but watching her step in between those two and just... [pause] The way she spoke up? [very quietly] That tiny voice of hers suddenly had this, um, this authority to it. [delighted] And they listened! Both of them just stopped yelling and actually listened to her. [laugh] I kept thinking she was going to freeze up like she always does, you know? [empathetically] But she didn't. She took that deep breath—exactly like we practiced—and she just went for it. [proud] "Let's find what you both actually need here." That's what she said. [chuckle] Word for word what we rehearsed, but she made it sound so natural. [slowly] And then when she got them to shake hands at the end? [emotional] I almost cried. Actually, no, I did cry a little. [laugh softly] Six months ago she couldn't even order coffee without, uh, without turning bright red. [warmly] And today she mediated a real conflict. A real one. [sigh] God, I feel like a proud parent or something. [happy] My little dove finally found her wings.
