Speaker [en]: [hesitantly] You probably don't remember me, but um, we met at that coffee shop on Third Street about—it was two years ago. [pause] You were behind me in line and I was, [shaky voice] my card got declined and I was counting change and just... [trailing off] completely falling apart, honestly. [warm] You stepped up and bought my coffee. Just like that. [long pause] 

The thing is, [crying while speaking] I was on my way to a job interview. My last shot, really. I'd been unemployed for eight months and—[sniffle] that morning my car broke down, my phone died, everything was just... [very sad] I almost didn't go. But that coffee, that tiny gesture, it— [pause] 

[smiling speaking] You said something too. "Rough mornings make the best stories later," or something like that. [relieved] I kept thinking about that during the interview. How you didn't know me but you just, you helped anyway. [passionately] I got the job! And now I'm— [extremely happy] God, I run the whole department now. 

[very sincerely] I've been coming back here hoping to see you again because, well, [emotional pause] you saved my life that day. You really did. [whispering] Thank you. I know it was nothing to you, but [empathetically] it was everything to me.
