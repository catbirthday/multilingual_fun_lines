[short pause] I almost deleted that stupid DNA test results email last week because I was so done with dead ends, and now there's three of them. Three siblings. [crying while speaking] And they sent pictures and we have the same nose, the same exact nose. [laugh] How is this even real? They said they've been searching for twenty years. Twenty years! I thought maybe my birth family just, um... moved on, you know? Like I was this chapter they closed. [sniffle] But they have this whole Facebook group they made just to find me. They hired a private investigator twice. [very quietly] They never stopped looking. [pause] And the oldest one, Sarah, she said she thinks about me every year on my birthday. She didn't even know my name but she'd light a candle. [crying while speaking] I don't know what to do with all this. Part of me wants to drive there right now, tonight, just show up and— [trailing off] But what if we meet and it's, um, it's not what they expected? What if I'm not what they expected? [relieved] God, but they want to meet me. They really want to meet me."
