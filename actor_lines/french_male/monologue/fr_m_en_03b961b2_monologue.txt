Speaker [en]: Well, I mean, I'm not saying I told them so, but... actually no, that's exactly what I'm saying. [bitter] For months—months!—I sat in those meetings while they talked about, you know, "disrupting the paradigm" and all that nonsense. [mocking] "Oh, we need to modernize! We need to embrace change!" Right, sure, because the system we had for thirty years was just, what, broken? 

[pause] 

And honestly, I tried to warn them. Like, I really did. [frustrated] But no, I was the dinosaur, wasn't I? The one who couldn't see the future. Well, um, here we are. Three million dollars later and the whole thing just—[laugh] it literally crashed. The entire network. Gone. 

[sarcastic] But hey, at least it was innovative, right? 

I just... the thing is, I don't even feel good about this. [sad] Okay, maybe a little. [chuckle] But mostly I'm just, er, exhausted. Because now guess who has to fix it? That's right—me and my "outdated" methods. [sigh] And you know what the worst part is? They're already talking about the next big transformation. Like this never even happened. I mean, how do you just—[trailing off] whatever. I need coffee.
