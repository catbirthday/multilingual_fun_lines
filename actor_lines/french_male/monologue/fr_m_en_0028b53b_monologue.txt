Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] Oh my God. Oh my God, this can't be—there's a message. They sent me a message. [gasp softly] "We've been searching for you for twenty-three years." Twenty-three years. That's... that's my whole life. They've been looking for me my whole life. 

I don't even, um, I can't process this right now. [crying while speaking] There's photos attached and she looks—my birth mother looks exactly like me. Same nose, same weird eyebrow thing I do when I'm thinking. [nervous laugh] God, I always wondered where that came from.

And there's siblings? I have two half-sisters who've been, like, waiting to meet me? [very excited] They made a Facebook group called "Finding Sarah" and there's thirty-seven members—cousins, aunts, my birth father's parents are still alive and they... [pause] they never stopped hoping.

[whispering] What do I even say back? "Hi, thanks for not forgetting about me?" [bitter] No, that sounds—I'm not angry, I'm just... overwhelmed. Really, really overwhelmed. They said they understand if I need time but they've waited so long already and honestly, [warm] I think I've been waiting too. Without even knowing it, you know? 

[hesitantly] Maybe I should call my mom first. My adoptive mom. Tell her that... [trailing off] that I found them. Or they found me. We found each other.
