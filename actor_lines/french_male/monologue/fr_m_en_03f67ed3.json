She actually used it and someone is alive right now because of it. [pause] I keep thinking about that PowerPoint slide I almost cut because I thought it was too basic. The one about, um... about asking indirect questions when you can't speak privately. Sarah said that's exactly what tipped her off. Her client kept mentioning her \"friend\" who was having these problems, and Sarah remembered—she remembered what we practiced. [emotional] God, I'm shaking. This is why we do this work, right? But you never really expect to hear that it—that it actually saved someone. [sniffle] Sarah said the woman is safe now. They got her out. Her kids too. [very quietly] I've been doing this training for three years and sometimes I wonder if anyone's really listening, if it makes any difference. [pause] And then something like this happens and it's like... [relieved] okay. Okay, this matters. Every boring workshop, every PowerPoint, every role-play exercise that people roll their eyes at—it all matters. [deep breath] Someone's alive tonight because Sarah was paying attention in that conference room. [warmly] Someone gets to start over."
