I told her it was age-related when it was actually—[gasp softly] Jesus, it was sudden sensorineural hearing loss in her left ear.

Completely gone in that ear. [pause] And she trusted me, you know? She sat in my office and I said \"nothing to worry about\" and she believed me because I'm supposed to—[bitter] I'm supposed to know what I'm looking at. [very sad] Seven years of practice and I made a first-year mistake. \n\n[mumbling] I keep thinking about her face when I explained what happened. She didn't even get angry, she just looked... confused. Like, how could this happen? [sigh] And I had to sit there knowing that, um... knowing that it was my fault.
