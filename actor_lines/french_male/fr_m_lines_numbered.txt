# Speaker Lines Only (Translated) - French (Male)
============================================================

1. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear you're having issues with your tips! Let me pull up your account here—can you give me your employee ID number so I can see what's going on?
2. Perfect, thank you so much! So I've got employee ID 42589 here, and I can see you're at location ST-1147-B downtown, and um, I'm looking at your most recent paycheck from... let me just... okay, December 15th, is that the one we're talking about?
3. Got it.
4. Oh wow, um, that's definitely concerning—so let me, uh, pull up the tip distribution report for that pay period, reference number PAY-121524-TIP, and, hmm, I can see here that your location reported $2,847 in pooled tips divided among twelve partners...
5. Oh that's—hmm, that could definitely be the issue then! So the system's showing twelve active partners in the pool for that period, but you're saying it was actually eight people working those shifts?
6. Right right.
7. I completely understand your frustration, and honestly, um, I've seen this happen before with the system not updating when people leave—so what I can do is, uh, submit a payroll correction request, that's form PCR-9847, and it usually takes about... well, three to five business days to process.
8. Oh gosh, I really, really feel for you on this—I mean, the timing couldn't be worse, and I wish I could just... but let me see if there's anything else we can do here, okay?
9. So, um, what I'm gonna do—and this isn't a perfect solution but—I can flag this as urgent with code URG-HARDSHIP-12, and uh, that sometimes gets it looked at within 24 hours, and then also, hmm, have you registered for our emergency advance program?
10. Absolutely! Yeah, so it's program code EAP-2024, and basically if you have a documented payroll discrepancy like this—which you do, I'm creating ticket TKT-458892 right now—you can get up to 70% of the disputed amount advanced while we sort everything out.
11. Oh, oh no, I'm—I'm really sorry about that, um, that's that's definitely not what we want happening, let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick, can I—can I get your account number?
12. Right right, okay so, um, account 447-281, I've got you here and, uh, I can see you've called—oh wow—three times today already, that's, um, that must be really frustrating with with the baby situation.
13. So let me—no wait—actually, um, I'm gonna put a note here, reference code REF-9982-BK, that basically flags your account for, uh, for priority callback service, which means no more hold music at all.
14. Yeah that's, that's totally fair, um, I'm looking at the notes here from your previous calls, ticket numbers TKT-4419 and TKT-4420, and it looks like they—they didn't, uh, didn't actually complete the process, which is, um, honestly on us.
15. Absolutely absolutely, so, um, what I'm doing right now is, uh, is setting up your account—let me just—okay so confirmation number CNF-7734-XP—this ensures you'll never hit our hold queue again, you'll go straight through.
16. I get it, I really do, um, so here's what's different—I'm, I'm putting through an override code OVR-2981-MK that, uh, that literally bypasses our entire phone system, it's it's something we usually only do for, um, for special circumstances.
17. No no, you're right, this this should've been done earlier, um, I'm also seeing here in your account that, uh, we can apply a service credit, code CRD-5567-TN, for for all the inconvenience today.
18. Of course, yeah, so um, the bypass is is active now, effective immediately, and, uh, I've also added priority status PST-8823 to your account which means, um, any future issues get escalated straight to to senior support, no waiting.
19. Promise, and and actually, um, here's my direct extension, 4782, bypasses everything, goes straight to to this department, I've also, uh, sent you an email with confirmation number EML-9901-QR with all these details.
20. Yes yes, all set, um, everything's saved under case number CSE-6672-LP, and uh, again, really sorry about about the wake-ups, that's, that's rough with little ones.
21. Okay okay, um, I understand that's really concerning. Let me, uh, pull up your account here—what's your account number?
22. Got it got it. Account ACC-477-289-B, um, and I'm seeing your latest statement here for, uh, $487.23 which is—yeah that's definitely higher than your average.
23. That's that's a good question. Um, let me check your usage patterns in system code UTL-9847-M here, and uh, I can see there was a spike starting around the 15th.
24. Right right. Um, so here's what we're gonna do—I'm putting in a meter inspection request, reference MET-3982-QV, no charge to you.
25. No no no, um, I hear you. This is different. I'm actually, uh, coding it as priority concern PRI-7763-X which means it it bypasses billing.
26. Um, with priority status? Within 48 hours. And and while we're waiting, uh, I can also apply a payment extension, code EXT-5529-R, gives you 30 extra days.
27. There's there's honestly no catch. Um, I'm also seeing you qualify for our, uh, hardship program under code HRD-2246-K—that could reduce your bill by 25%.
28. Absolutely absolutely. Look, um, I see single household, one dependent, and uh, these spikes happen—faulty appliance, wiring issue—we're gonna figure this out.
29. Thursday latest. Um, I'm putting notes in ticket TKT-8891-Z that you need morning appointment, uh, because of school drop-off, that work?
30. You can breathe. Um, your confirmation is CNF-4455-MP, and uh, I promise—we're we're gonna get this sorted. No one should pay triple. That's that's not right.
31. Hi there! So, um, I'd be happy to help you with those streaming charges today, and basically what I can do is, uh, pull up your account here and we'll figure out exactly what's going on, okay?
32. Absolutely! So let me just, um, get your account information here. Can you give me the, uh, the phone number or email associated with your account so I can, like, pull up those charges?
33. Perfect, got it! So I'm seeing here your account number is ACC-7829-MX and, um, basically there are three streaming services showing up. Let me just... okay so there's one for $14.99, another for $8.99, and, uh, a third one that's $19.99.
34. Yeah, I know, it can definitely be, like, overwhelming when they all add up! So, um, looking at the details here with reference code REF-394827-B, the first one is StreamPlus, the second is, uh, MovieBox Classic, and the third one is... hmm, okay so this one's interesting.
35. So basically the third charge with transaction ID TXN-885743-QV is, um, it's actually a duplicate! Like, you're being charged twice for the same service, which is, uh, yeah, I know, it's ridiculous that this happens but I can definitely fix this for you right now.
36. Absolutely! So what I'm gonna do is, um, process a refund for those duplicate charges. Your refund number will be RFD-229847-K and, uh, you should see that credit within 3-5 business days. Plus, like, I'm adding a service credit too.
37. Of course! And so, um, honestly? Between you and me, this happens more than it should. The system sometimes just, like, creates these duplicate subscriptions and, uh, it's really annoying. But your new monthly total will just be $23.98 instead of $43.97.
38. Right? So I've also added a note to your file, um, case number CSE-449281-T, just to make sure this doesn't happen again. And, uh, basically if you see any weird charges next month, you just reference that case number.
39. Aw, I'm so glad I could help! So is there, um, anything else with those streaming services? Like, do you actually use MovieBox Classic? Because, uh, looking at your usage data here, profile ID USR-338492-P shows you haven't logged in for three months.
40. So yeah, honestly, if you're not using it, let's just, um, cancel that one too! I'll process that right now with cancellation code CAN-774930-J and, uh, that'll save you another $8.99 a month. There we go, all set!
41. I understand. That's frustrating. Let me... I need to pull up your account first... what's the account number?
42. Okay so, um, account 872-394, and I'm seeing... hmm... there's actually, uh, quite a few toll charges here, let me just... okay so that's interesting...
43. Right. Right. So looking at... um, what's the word... your transaction history TRN-9823-AL, there's, uh, seventeen toll charges just this week and... hmm, some of these routes don't even...
44. Unfortunately I can only... um, I mean, the system shows... let me see here... these are coded as EZP-7741 transactions which, uh, limits what I can... hmm...
45. Got it.
46. I wish I could just... um, you know, clear them all but... wait. Wait wait. Let me, uh, check something... your vehicle tag VHL-8823-K is... hmm...
47. No no, I totally understand, and looking at case history CSE-4419-B through CSE-4427-B, you've called nine times about this.
48. Oh! Oh okay so, um, I think I see... uh, there's a duplicate tag! Someone's, um, using tag number VHL-8823-K but it's, uh, linked to two accounts and...
49. Exactly! So, um, here's what I can do... let me just... okay so I'm creating override OVR-2947-X which, uh, basically flags all these charges for reversal and, um, permanently blocks that duplicate...
50. No need to apologize! This has been going on way too long. Your credit for $247.83 will post within 24 hours under reference CRD-8829-V. Problem. Solved.
51. Oh yeah, absolutely! They've got, you know, this incredible circulatory system where two hearts pump blood to the gills and, um, one pumps it to the rest of the body.
52. Well, it's all about [laugh hard] oxygen efficiency underwater! See, their blood uses copper instead of iron, which makes it blue and less efficient at carrying oxygen than ours.
53. Oh, you'd be surprised! Horseshoe crabs [empathetically] also have blue blood, and it's actually super valuable for medical testing because it clots when it detects bacteria.
54. Totally! It's, well, it's called LAL testing, and basically every vaccine you've ever gotten was, you know, tested with it to make sure there's no bacterial contamination.
55. Ah, Turritopsis dohrnii! They can [shaky voice] theoretically live forever by reverting back to their polyp stage when stressed, basically hitting the biological reset button.
56. Pretty much! It's like if you could transform back into a baby whenever you got sick or old, complete cellular transdifferentiation.
57. Well, they still get eaten by predators, disease can kill them, and most don't actually trigger the reversal before dying naturally.
58. Oh man, those are [very sincerely] the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom! They can see twelve to sixteen types of color receptors compared to our measly three.
59. Ultraviolet, visible light, polarized light, even circular polarized light which literally no other animal can detect!
60. Basically, yeah! They're, hmm, experiencing a visual reality that's, you know, completely beyond human comprehension, like having, er, superhero vision times a thousand.
61. Oh man, well, three months is actually, you know, right when most people hit that wall where they think they're not progressing. But here's the thing - you're probably way better than you realize, it's just that your ear is developing faster than your fingers.
62. That's the finger strength issue! Your brain knows what it should sound like but your fingers aren't pressing hard enough yet to get clean notes. Takes about six months to build up those weird little muscles you never use otherwise.
63. You probably can play songs though! Just not the ones you're imagining. Start with something dead simple like "Wonderwall" or "Good Riddance" - three chords, basic strumming pattern, instant gratification.
64. Because they work! Look, every guitarist started with those cliché campfire songs before moving on to the cool stuff. It's like learning to write by copying sentences before you write novels.
65. "Smoke on the Water" - just the riff though, er, not even the whole song. I played it, honestly, probably a thousand times until my roommate, like, threatened to break my guitar.
66. YouTube University all the way. Started with Marty Music, then JustinGuitar, bounced around until I found teachers whose style clicked with how my brain works.
67. After four years of practice! And I still messed up the bridge on that second song, but nobody noticed because confidence sells it better than perfection ever could.
68. So what? I mean, some people start at sixty and, actually, they often progress faster because, well, they're more patient and don't expect overnight miracles like us younger folks do.
69. Daily practice is the secret sauce for sure! But, um, here's what nobody tells you - [animated] practicing wrong, you know, for an hour is worse than, basically, practicing correctly for ten minutes.
70. Record yourself playing something simple, then listen back. If it sounds [mocking] like a dying cat trying to sing Metallica, well, slow it down by half and try again.
71. Six weeks of what, just staring at [angry] walls and scrolling through their Instagram? That's not healing, that's self-torture, and you're basically building a prison out of their memories.
72. Look, I mean, staying inside is, actually, making it worse because, er, you're just marinating in all those shared spaces where you used to be together.
73. Control? You're not controlling anything, you're just, [chuckle] honestly, hiding from life while it, um, keeps moving without you, kind of like watching through a window.
74. That's exactly what I mean - you've turned [anxious] every room into a monument to what was, instead of reclaiming those spaces piece by piece for yourself.
75. Start small, like, one corner at a time, you know, rearrange the furniture, honestly, paint a wall, anything to break those, um, visual triggers.
76. Because you're not ready to let go yet, and, well, that's okay, but, er, at some point this preservation becomes, basically, self-imprisonment.
77. Not choosing exactly, but, hmm, you're definitely not fighting it either, sort of, accepting it as, you know, your new normal when it shouldn't be.
78. Then don't fight the whole war at once, just, um, win tiny battles like, actually, making your bed or, well, opening one window to let fresh air in.
79. No, but suffocating in stale air won't [sarcastic] magically bring them back either, and at least oxygen might help your brain function enough to process this grief properly.
80. Nothing makes heartbreak easier, but, you know, staying locked up like this is, basically, giving them power over your life even after, um, they've already moved on.
81. You can't fix this for me, nobody can, it's like, the thing is, my whole life got ripped apart and, er, I don't even know where to start rebuilding.
82. But I'm not even doing that, I mean, I'm barely [excited] existing here, honestly, just going through motions while, you know, feeling completely dead inside.
83. Protection? This feels more like, um, drowning in slow motion where, actually, every breath takes effort and, well, nothing seems worth the energy anymore.
84. Food tastes like cardboard and I can't [cry loudly] keep anything down anyway because my stomach is constantly in knots from missing them so much.
85. I know that logically but my brain keeps [frustrated] telling me that taking care of myself is pointless when the person I love doesn't want me anymore.
86. Their opinion shouldn't define me but it does, and I hate myself for still caring what they think after everything that happened between us.
87. But I want them to disappear, like, desperately need them gone because, actually, carrying this love for someone who left is, er, absolutely excruciating.
88. Sometimes I think about, hmm, just packing everything and starting over somewhere new where, basically, nothing reminds me of what we had, you know?
89. Probably not because the memories would follow me anyway, but at least I wouldn't have to see our favorite coffee shop or the park bench where we first kissed.
90. I know you're right but, well, accepting that means, sort of, admitting it's really over and, honestly, I'm not ready for that finality yet.
91. Insane? After everything we've been through? I watched you eat cereal with orange juice for three months straight because you "didn't believe in milk."
92. The one where you, well, supposedly died for eleven minutes? Yeah, kind of, er, hard to forget when the doctors called it, you know, "medically impossible" that you came back.
93. Okay... I mean, near-death experiences are, actually, more common than people think — the brain does, uh, fascinating things when it's oxygen-deprived, honestly.
94. Wait, wait, wait. So, you're saying that while you were, hmm, technically dead, you somehow, basically, glimpsed the future? That's what you're, err, telling me right now?
95. How could you possibly— Sarah hasn't told anyone yet! She literally just found out yesterday morning and only called me because she was freaking out!
96. This is— I can't— [short pause] look, there has to be, actually, some kind of logical explanation for this, I mean, there always is.
97. WHAT?! How do you— I haven't even— [laugh histerically] this is absolutely impossible! The lawyer just gave me the key this morning!
98. More?! You're telling me, um, that death gave you [enunciating every word] supernatural foresight, and there's MORE? What, actually, could possibly top, you know, predicting the future?
99. Jesus Christ. That's— that's [sad] horrifying. You're telling me you walk around seeing death timestamps on everyone? Including me?
100. Changed? What do you mean "changed"? Time doesn't just rewrite itself because of a conversation! Unless... unless you're here to warn me about something.
101. [defensive] Look, um, I didn't know you'd be working here, [tense], okay, so maybe we should just, uh, keep this professional.
102. [firmly] Yes, because right now I've got, [measured], forty million dollars worth of cargo sitting on that ship that needs, [urgent], to clear customs before midnight or we're both, [stressed], completely screwed.
103. [heated] Oh, so now you want to, um, do this here? Fine—I left because, [raw], well, staying meant watching Dad drink himself to death while you all, uh, pretended everything was perfect!
104. [cold] Fighting would have meant actually, [harsh], acknowledging there was a problem instead of enabling him every single day.
105. The manifest numbers are, [mechanical], B-447 through B-492, all legitimate, all time-sensitive, all requiring your signature.
106. [warning] Don't even think about it—this isn't just, um, about me anymore, there are, uh, hundreds of jobs riding on this shipment. [sighs]
107. [guilty] I didn't know it would—look, um, I sent money back, every month for, uh, two years but Mom kept returning the checks unopened, so don't act like I didn't, well, try.
108. He asked about me? When he was—God, I didn't, um, know he even remembered I existed after everything he said, [choked up], that night before I left, about how I was, well, no son of his. [pause]
109. [crying] Please, I can't—just process the cargo and, um, let me go because if we keep talking like this, [desperate], I might actually believe there's still something here worth, uh, salvaging between us. [shaky breath]
110. I'm, um, staying. [long pause]
111. Oh merde, euh, attendez je vais juste—désolé, faut que j'ouvre votre compte. Vous pouvez, euh, me donner votre numéro d'employé ? Ça devrait être, euh, ça commence sûrement par EMP et puis genre six chiffres après, je crois.
112. C'est noté.
113. Okay alors, euh, je regarde votre dossier là—EMP447829—et, heu, ouais c'est... hmm, c'est franchement ridicule. Ils vous ont mis, euh, attendez voir... seulement 312 kilomètres pour toute la période de paie ? Ça peut pas être ça, enfin, c'est quoi, genre trois jours de livraisons ?
114. Ouais non, c'est—enfin, euh, ça arrive plus souvent que ça devrait, franchement. Le système qu'on utilise pour le suivi est, heu, c'est vraiment de la merde. Attendez que je, euh, vérifie vos journaux de route par rapport à ce qui a été soumis dans le fichier de paie PAY-2024-1182-B.
115. Alors, euh, voilà ce que je peux faire—et genre, je sais que c'est chiant parce que vous devriez pas avoir à attendre—mais je dois, heu, faire une demande de correction avec le formulaire CRQ-7739. Ça va prendre, euh, probablement cinq à sept jours ouvrables pour traiter ? Peut-être moins si je mets urgent.
116. Je sais, je sais.
117. Écoutez, euh, entre nous ? Tout le système de remboursement est, heu, il est pété. Genre je soumets probablement, euh, quinze de ces corrections chaque semaine. Mais l'option la plus rapide—et bon, je suis pas censé suggérer ça—c'est si vous, euh, parlez à votre manager direct pour avoir un code de forçage manuel, ça commence par OVR, et là il peut faire passer ça le jour même.
118. Évidemment. Euh, okay alors, hmm, attendez que je réfléchisse... En fait, attendez, je peux—désolé, je vérifie un autre truc là—si je soumets ça sous le code d'ajustement ADJ-994-URGENT au lieu de la correction normale, ça, heu, ça pourrait marcher ? C'est techniquement pour d'autres problèmes mais...
119. Oui oui c'est sûr.
120. Alors voilà ce que je vais faire—et je, euh, je mets mon numéro d'employé TSR-8847 dessus pour qu'ils sachent que j'ai approuvé—je le soumets sous les deux codes. Le ADJ-994-URGENT et, heu, le CRQ-7739-A normal. L'un des deux devrait passer d'ici, hmm, mercredi au plus tard ? Et j'envoie aussi, euh, un signal directement à la paie. Je peux pas promettre le jour même mais c'est, euh, c'est mieux que d'attendre la semaine complète, vous voyez ?
121. Oh, je peux absolument vous aider avec ça! Laissez-moi juste—ah attendez en fait—laissez-moi d'abord ouvrir votre compte. Vous pouvez me donner les quatre derniers chiffres de la carte?
122. Non non, c'est bon! D'accord. Je le vois là. Compte se terminant par 7852. Maintenant laissez-moi juste—désolé, le système fait des—voilà c'est bon. On regarde quel prélèvement aujourd'hui?
123. D'accord d'accord. Laissez-moi trouver ça. Je vois—ah non c'est pas—désolé, le voilà. Transaction ID TXN-994782-SPG pour 97 dollars et 18 cents. Posté il y a trois jours. C'est bien celui-là?
124. Vous savez quoi? Laissez-moi bien vérifier ça. Parce que parfois ces prélèvements—oh attendez—je vois justement quelque chose dans nos alertes fraude. Numéro de référence FRD-88234-A. Ce marchand a eu plusieurs contestations aujourd'hui.
125. Absolument pas! Vous avez bien fait d'appeler. Alors. Je vais m'assurer. Qu'on règle ça complètement pour vous. Je lance la contestation tout de suite. Numéro de dossier DSP-445901-R.
126. Alors voilà ce que je fais—et c'est important—je marque ça comme prioritaire. À cause de cette alerte fraude. Le crédit provisoire. Devrait apparaître dans les 24 heures. Pas les trois à cinq jours habituels.
127. Oui! Et—désolé laissez-moi juste—j'ajoute aussi une note ici. Pour m'assurer. Si ce marchand essaie de facturer à nouveau. Ça sera refusé automatiquement. Code de protection PRT-7829-XX.
128. Non! J'ai tout géré. Votre confirmation c'est CNF-445901-DSP. Vous allez recevoir un email. Dans l'heure. Avec tous les détails.
129. Oh s'il vous plaît ne vous excusez pas! Ces choses arrivent. Et franchement? Vous l'avez repéré vite. C'est ça qui compte. Je vais juste—attendez—oui, je vois aussi qu'on peut annuler tous les frais associés. Code WVR-1127-F. Tout est bon.
130. C'est vraiment tout! Le crédit apparaîtra comme en attente demain matin. Référence RFD-445901-TEMP. Et si quoi que ce soit d'autre arrive. Avec ça ou un autre prélèvement. Rappelez juste avec ce numéro de dossier. On vous protège.
131. Euh, oui, eh, laissez-moi juste. Vérifier ça. Euh, est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de compte ou, euh, téléphone au dossier?
132. D'accord alors, euh, je vous vois ici, eh, compte PLT-4492-XX91 et, euh, on dirait que vous êtes avec nous depuis, euh. 2012. What can I, uh, help with today?
133. 800. Euh, d'accord laissez-moi, eh, euh, remonter jusqu'à septembre ici et—oh. Eh, journée chargée désolé, euh, je vois la transaction TXN-909847-K du 14 septembre pour, euh, exactement 800,00 $.
134. Euh, absolument, eh, je comprends que c'est, euh, préoccupant. Laissez-moi juste, euh, vérifier les détails ici sur la commande ORD-7829-MK41 et, eh, voir ce qui s'est passé.
135. Bien sûr, euh, alors en regardant ça, eh, le frais apparaît comme, euh, mise à niveau service premium mais, euh, il n'y a pas. Eh. Pas de code de confirmation attaché ce qui est, euh, inhabituel.
136. D'accord alors, euh, voici ce que je peux faire. Euh, je dois, eh, déposer le rapport RPT-55821-QV et, euh, normalement ça prend 5-7 jours mais, eh, étant donné votre statut je peux. Euh. Accélérer.
137. Euh, je vous entends, eh, je comprends complètement. Laissez-moi, euh, vérifier avec mon—en fait, euh, je peux outrepasser ça avec le code OVR-889-PRIORITY et, eh, traiter le remboursement dans, euh, 24 heures.
138. Alors, euh, la politique standard c'est, eh, juste le remboursement mais, euh, pour cette situation avec le numéro de référence REF-20831-PX, je peux, euh, aussi ajouter un crédit de service de 50 $.
139. Euh, laissez-moi. Euh. Vérifier quoi d'autre je peux. Eh, en fait pour les comptes de plus de 10 ans, euh, il y a un crédit discrétionnaire DIS-7744-A jusqu'à, euh, 150 $ que je peux appliquer.
140. Euh, absolument compris. Euh, j'ai tout noté dans le billet TKT-445892-L et, eh, ajouté un indicateur prioritaire. Vous verrez le, euh, remboursement de 800 $ plus le crédit de 150 $ dans, euh, 24 heures.
141. Euh, d'accord alors, euh, laissez-moi juste consulter votre compte ici et, euh, je peux voir que l'ID de transaction TXN-94827-CE montre, euh, deux charges pour le même module de formation continue, et euh, je comprends pourquoi c'est frustrant.
142. Alors, euh, je peux certainement vous aider avec ça, euh, et en regardant votre numéro de compte ACC-78293-ST, je vois que les deux charges sont passées le, euh, 15 novembre, donc euh, ce que je peux faire c'est soumettre une demande de remboursement pour une de ces charges.
143. Euh, absolument, alors, euh, la bonne nouvelle c'est que votre accès au module CEU-4482-LANG est, euh, déjà actif, et euh, vous pouvez le compléter n'importe quand, mais le remboursement pour la charge en double va, euh, prendre environ 3 à 5 jours ouvrables pour être traité via le formulaire REF-2024-1198.
144. Alors, euh, je comprends tout à fait l'urgence ici, et euh, même si je ne peux pas accélérer le processus bancaire, euh, ce que je peux faire c'est escalader ça avec le code de priorité PRI-URGENT-6673 pour, euh, m'assurer que ce soit traité dans les délais les plus courts.
145. Euh, vous avez tout à fait raison, et euh, en regardant les logs techniques ici sous le ticket TKT-889274, il semble qu'il y ait eu, euh, un bref bug système pendant le paiement qui, euh, a permis la soumission en double, ce qui ne devrait évidemment pas arriver.
146. Oui, euh, c'était définitivement une erreur de notre côté, et euh, j'ai noté ça dans votre dossier CSE-20241127-B, donc euh, on va s'assurer que ce soit complètement résolu.
147. Euh, je vous entends, et euh, je sais que ce timing est vraiment malheureux, alors, euh, ce que je vais aussi faire c'est ajouter une note à votre compte avec le numéro de référence REF-COMP-8892 pour, euh, un crédit de 20% sur votre prochain achat de crédits de formation comme excuse pour ce désagrément.
148. Alors, euh, vous soulevez un point vraiment valide là, et euh, laissez-moi voir ce que je peux, euh, offrir d'autre... d'accord alors avec le code d'autorisation superviseur SUP-OVERRIDE-4421, je peux, euh, en fait augmenter ça à un crédit complet de 50$ à la place.
149. Euh, alors même si je ne peux pas techniquement garantir la date exacte parce que, euh, ça dépend du traitement de votre banque, ce que je peux faire c'est, euh, marquer ça avec le code d'expédition EXP-PRIORITY-7756 qui, euh, d'après mon expérience, veut généralement dire que vous le verrez dans les 48 heures.
150. Euh, parfait, alors j'ai tout traité maintenant, euh, vous allez recevoir un courriel de confirmation à l'adresse enregistrée avec tous les numéros de référence incluant votre numéro de dossier principal CSE-20241127-B, et euh, je vais personnellement surveiller ça pour m'assurer que tout se passe bien.
151. I think I can, um, probably help with that. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Could you maybe give me your account number or, um, the phone number associated?
152. Got it, so I'm, uh, looking at account FTR-9982-L here, and um, I think I see what you're talking about. There's, uh, two charges for $475 each posted today?
153. Okay so I think what happened here—and this is, um, sort of common—the system probably had a little hiccup. Transaction ID TXN-4412-BK shows pending and then it, uh, posted twice.
154. Absolutely, so um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, I think submit a reversal request. It's form REV-2024-K7, and um, normally it takes maybe 3-5 business days but let me see if I can, uh, expedite this.
155. Right right. Okay. Let me check something else here.
156. No no, you're not being, um, difficult at all. So I'm, uh, looking at expedite option EXP-771, and I think, um, maybe we can get this reversed by end of business Monday?
157. Actually wait. I see you've been a customer since 2019. Let me check if you qualify for our instant reversal under policy POL-88-INSTANT.
158. So, um, I'm checking the criteria and, uh, you definitely qualify. Account history is, um, perfect, and I think since it's clearly a duplicate charge, I can probably just... yeah, initiating now.
159. Yep. Reference number is RFD-2024-5837-A. Should hit your account within 2-4 hours. I'd say probably check around 3pm.
160. Happy to help. Just keep that reference number RFD-2024-5837-A handy. And, um, maybe screenshot your confirmation page next time—sometimes the system times out but still processes.
161. Oh, je peux—je peux vraiment vous aider avec ça, laissez-moi juste, euh... comment dire... afficher vos détails de couverture ici, et, euh, votre numéro de membre c'est MEM-4782-BK91, c'est ça ? Je vois ici que, euh, l'interruption a commencé le mois dernier, et je vais—je vais m'assurer qu'on règle ça correctement pour vous.
162. Non non non, s'il vous plaît ne—ne le prenez pas comme ça, je veux dire, euh, ça arrive plus souvent que vous ne pensez, même aux, euh, professionnels de santé en fait, et ce que je vois ici c'est, euh, vos soins préventifs ont expiré le 15 octobre, code de confirmation CXP-882094, mais je peux—je peux absolument vous réinscrire.
163. D'accord d'accord, alors, euh, normalement c'est... c'est environ 48 heures pour que la, euh, pour que la réinscription soit traitée, mais laissez-moi voir si je peux... hmm, en fait, il y a une—une option d'inscription rapide ici, code REP-7731-QV, qui pourrait vous rendre actif dès, euh, demain matin.
164. Absolument, je vais—je vais m'assurer que ce soit, euh, expédié pour vous parce que je vois que vous êtes avec nous depuis, euh, laissez-moi vérifier... six ans, numéro de compte ACC-293847-D, et franchement ? Vous ne devriez pas attendre quand c'est juste une—une simple interruption comme ça.
165. Oh non non non, jamais, je veux dire, euh, mon travail c'est de—de vous protéger contre ce genre de problèmes à l'avenir, donc ce que je fais aussi c'est, euh, mettre en place un indicateur de renouvellement automatique, numéro de référence ARF-9982-TK, donc ça ne... vous savez, ça n'arrivera plus...
166. Alors c'est, euh, ça va rester pareil, 47,50$ par mois, mais—mais voilà, je peux pas, euh, je peux pas antidater la couverture pour cette période d'interruption, enfin, j'aimerais bien mais le système ne... bref, à partir de maintenant vous êtes entièrement couvert.
167. Exact, mais euh, ce que je peux—peux faire c'est appliquer le code de crédit CRD-6643-MN pour, euh, pour le désagrément, ce qui vous donne, euh, en gros votre premier mois de retour gratuit, et puis tout... continue normalement à partir de là.
168. Bien sûr, bien sûr, et euh, j'ai aussi ajouté un—un service de rappel à votre compte, numéro de suivi TRK-8827-PL91, donc vous aurez, euh, des textos et des courriels avant toute date de renouvellement, juste pour être sûr... vous voyez...
169. Ben, c'est—c'est configuré maintenant, et c'est, euh, c'est ça qui compte, non ? Votre nouveau numéro de police c'est POL-7764-BK22, et vous allez recevoir le, euh, le courriel de confirmation dans... hmm, environ dix minutes.
170. C'est pour ça que je suis—je suis là, et euh, sérieusement, n'hésitez pas à appeler si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, votre numéro de dossier pour aujourd'hui c'est CSE-9981-VT, et j'ai mis des notes détaillées donc, euh, n'importe qui à qui vous parlez saura exactement... exactement ce qu'on a configuré aujourd'hui.
171. Bon bon d'accord alors laissez-moi consulter votre compte et on peut certainement explorer des options de forfait groupé pour vous aujourd'hui votre numéro de compte est ACC-7294-BX et je vois que vous avez actuellement juste le service internet c'est correct?
172. Euh, ouais alors, genre, en regardant votre forfait actuel ici, vous êtes sur notre internet seul à 79,99 par mois, et, euh, je peux voir dans le système code PKG-8847-WM que si vous groupez avec notre service télé vous, hmm, économiseriez vraiment pas mal.
173. Alors avec le forfait triple play c'est internet télé et téléphone sous le code promo SAVE-4429-Q vous seriez à 99 euros tout rond pour les trois services ce qui fait moins de 20 de plus que ce que vous payez maintenant pour juste internet mais vous avez tout inclus.
174. Mmm ouais je comprends totalement cette hésitation et en regardant l'historique de votre compte ici sous le ticket TKT-9982-LP je vois qu'il y a eu un problème de facturation avant alors laissez-moi m'assurer qu'on configure ça correctement cette fois si vous décidez d'aller de l'avant.
175. Bon, euh, laissez-moi juste, euh, vérifier ici et... oh c'est intéressant, alors vous êtes client depuis, hmm, 2018 d'après le dossier CUS-1147-AA et, ben, franchement les clients de longue date comme vous devraient certainement avoir nos meilleurs tarifs.
176. Vous savez quoi laissez-moi voir ce que je peux faire d'autre ici parce que 5 ans c'est une fidélité significative et il pourrait y avoir... comment dire... un tarif non publié auquel je peux accéder avec le code override OVR-3360-Z qui est encore mieux que le forfait standard.
177. Okay alors, euh, c'est en fait, euh, une très bonne nouvelle, genre avec votre statut de fidélité je peux appliquer le code de réduction LOY-5571-MK ce qui ramène ce forfait triple à, hmm, 89,99 et c'est bloqué pour 24 mois sans augmentation de prix.
178. Tout à fait légitime et je veux dire le numéro de confirmation pour cette offre est CNF-8823-DX et je peux vous envoyer tous les termes par email maintenant comme ça vous avez tout par écrit avant de vous engager sur quoi que ce soit pas de surprises cette fois.
179. Absolument.
180. Je vous entends complètement et c'est pourquoi je m'assure que tout est documenté sous la référence REF-7749-KL et franchement s'il y a le moindre problème vous pouvez rappeler avec cette référence et n'importe quel agent pourra voir exactement ce qu'on a promis aujourd'hui et arranger les choses.
181. Oh mon dieu, euh, je suis vraiment désolé pour ça, laissez-moi juste consulter votre compte ici et, euh, voir ce qui se passe avec la musique d'attente, est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de compte ou de téléphone?
182. Parfait, alors ça me donne le compte ACC-55527-M49, et euh, hmm, je vois ici que vous avez appelé 3 fois aujourd'hui déjà, c'est bien ça?
183. Ouais alors, euh, je suis vraiment désolé pour ça, genre, je sais à quel point ça doit être frustrant surtout avec, euh, avec un petit à la maison, laissez-moi juste vérifier ce qui s'est passé avec ces appels précédents.
184. D'accord alors, euh, en regardant les notes ici de la référence REF-2024-11847, ça dit qu'ils étaient, euh, en train d'essayer d'aider avec un problème de facturation mais vous vous êtes fait déconnecter?
185. Oh, oh wow, euh, c'est vraiment, hmm, c'est vraiment pas correct, alors genre entre vous et moi, notre musique d'attente est réglée beaucoup trop fort et, euh, ça fait des mois que je leur dis qu'il faut l'ajuster.
186. Absolument, ouais alors, euh, voici ce que je vais faire, je mets une note dans votre dossier FLG-NOHOLD-729 qui, euh, vous exempte de toutes les files d'attente, et euh, I'm gonna handle your billing issue right now myself.
187. Mmhmm, alors genre, euh, techniquement je suis supposé transférer les problèmes de facturation au code de département DEP-BILL-4, mais euh, vu la situation, I mean, I've got the access anyway, alors occupons-nous de ça maintenant.
188. Oh là là, euh, je comprends totalement, ma sœur a des jumeaux et, euh, elle dit la même chose sur l'heure de la sieste qui est genre, hmm, sacrée ou quelque chose comme ça, alors restons vraiment silencieux et rapides, votre code d'ajustement de facturation ADJ-9928-XK est déjà en traitement.
189. Ouais alors, euhhh, en gros ce que j'ai fait c'est, ben, appliquer le code de crédit CRD-50-COURTESY pour le dérangement, et euh, réglé la charge originale qui apparaissait comme code d'erreur ERR-DUPLICATE-421, so you should be all set now.
190. Non non, euh, je vous promets que tout est réglé, et genre, voici mon poste direct EXT-4472 si, euh, quelque chose arrive, mais honnêtement votre compte est parfait maintenant, le numéro de confirmation CNF-88291-SUCCESS est dans votre courriel, et euh, sérieusement, profitez de ce moment tranquille pendant que le bébé dort.
191. [sharp inhale] Bon, absolument, je sors votre compte maintenant—ah attendez, laissez-moi avoir le bon écran—voilà c'est bon, quel est votre numéro de compte ou le téléphone enregistré?
192. [exhales] D'accord alors, euh, je vois le compte ACC-7823-M lié à ce numéro et, euh, oh non—enfin, je vois les notes ici et, hmm, ouais c'est—c'est vraiment pas normal du tout.
193. Non non non, on va régler ça tout de suite, euh, je vois des notes d'agent de—attendez, lundi, puis mercredi—pardon, puis une autre d'aujourd'hui, et euh, ils disent tous des dates de livraison différentes pour la commande ORD-9847-PQ21?
194. [sharp breath] Ah! Installation—pardon, mauvais—enfin, euh, laissez-moi vérifier le ticket de service plutôt, c'est, euh, ticket SVC-4419-K et, hmm, wow d'accord c'est encore plus embrouillé que je pensais.
195. [exhales heavily] Écoutez, euh, je suis vraiment désolé pour ça, genre, sincèrement c'est, euh, ça devrait pas arriver et je regarde ces notes et je suis—enfin, je suis frustré POUR vous, c'est ridicule.
196. Bon bon.
197. [breath catches] D'accord alors voilà ce qu'on fait—je vais, euh, escalader ça à—non attendez, en fait, je m'en occupe moi-même parce que le numéro de référence REF-8823-XM montre la VRAIE date d'installation pour jeudi le 15.
198. Non attendez—pardon, laissez-moi, euh, revérifier parce que—[sharp inhale]—d'accord alors dans le système A ça dit jeudi mais, euh, hmm, dans notre système de dispatch DSP-7749 ça montre en fait, euh, mercredi? C'est—c'est exactement ça le problème.
199. [long exhale] Moi aussi franchement, mais euh, vous savez quoi? Je vais, euh, personnellement appeler le dispatch maintenant pendant que vous patientez et on va—enfin, on règle ça AUJOURD'HUI avec un code de confirmation en attente.
200. Deux minutes, promis—et quand je reviens, vous aurez UNE date, UN numéro de confirmation, et je mets une note prioritaire OVR-9923-AA pour que personne puisse encore changer.
201. D'accord alors, euh, laisse-moi juste... hmm... consulter ton compte ici et... c'est quoi ton employee ID number si tu l'as?
202. Compris, alors c'est EMP-44298-TH et je vois ici que t'es listé comme temps partiel au Grandview Theater location, et on dirait que... hmm... ta fenêtre d'inscription pour les benefits s'est fermée le 15 octobre.
203. Bon, alors, euh, le truc c'est que... and I understand this is frustrating... mais la notification est partie par email à ton adresse enregistrée qui est, euh, attends voir... jsmith447 at gmail, et on voit qu'elle a été ouverte le 22 septembre?
204. Oh c'est... hmm, c'est bizarre en fait parce que, euh, je vois ici une demande de changement CRQ-7739-B d'août mais c'est... laisse-moi voir... c'est marqué comme pending? Ça devrait pas être encore pending.
205. Alors malheureusement la période d'inscription est, euh, elle est fermée, mais ce que je peux faire c'est... hmm... soumettre une appeal request sous le numéro de cas APL-9982-KF puisqu'il y avait clairement, euh, une sorte d'erreur système de notre côté.
206. Okay okay.
207. Alors, euh, le processus d'appel prend typiquement, euh, 5 à 7 jours ouvrables, mais je vais... attends voir... I'm marking this as priority à cause de l'échec de mise à jour de l'email.
208. Oui oui, alors tu qualifies selon les heures, c'est pas le problème, c'est juste la, euh, la fenêtre manquée, mais honnêtement avec le cas APL-9982-KF qui montre que notre système a pas traité ton changement d'email? I think you've got a really strong case here.
209. Je sais, et, euh, je vais m'assurer de tout documenter vraiment clairement dans ton dossier alors... hmm, en fait, tu sais quoi? Let me also add reference code RES-4419-A qui signale ça pour une révision immédiate par le superviseur.
210. Alors oui, euh, basically tu vas recevoir un email—et j'ai mis à jour à l'adresse 448 maintenant donc c'est, euh, c'est réglé—dans les 48 heures avec la détermination initiale, et si t'as besoin d'autre chose, ton numéro de cas encore c'est APL-9982-KF.
211. Oh okay so, um, let me just, like, pull up your account here and—entre nous là? Les trucs de parking, c'est, euh, totalement ridicule. C'est quoi ton ID employé?
212. Right right, so, um, I've got you here, EMP-4412-CHB, and, uh, wow, ils te chargent genre... 35 dollars? Par jour? C'est, euh, c'est vraiment insensé pour le parking du personnel.
213. Yeah so, um, here's what I'm gonna do, et genre, techniquement je suis pas supposé dire ça, mais, euh, y'a en fait un code—PKG-EXEMPT-07—qui, euh, aurait dû être appliqué au personnel de l'aumônerie y'a des mois.
214. I know, I know, it's, um, completely ridiculous that you're literally, like, doing spiritual care, pis ils sont là à, euh, te gruger pour le parking. Alors laisse-moi juste, euh, appliquer ça rétroactivement et—
215. So, um, between you and me? Ils disent ça parce que, genre, la plupart des agents connaissent pas le code PKG-EXEMPT-07, mais, euh, je suis ici depuis assez longtemps pour, euh, connaître les solutions. Je traite le remboursement RFD-7829-XL maintenant.
216. Okay so, uh, looking at your transaction history—TXN-LOG-4412—you're, um, tu es dû environ, hmm, laisse-moi calculer... 3200, et, euh, 15 dollars en remboursements de parking.
217. Yeah it's, um, it's honestly criminal what they do. Alors genre, je fais passer le remboursement complet, numéro de référence REF-9982-QV, et, euh, je marque aussi ton compte pour que tu sois exempté en permanence à l'avenir.
218. Totally real, and, um, honestly? Ça arrive, genre, beaucoup trop souvent avec les aumôniers, les travailleurs sociaux, essentiellement tous ceux qui font, euh, le vrai travail de soins. La confirmation système SYS-CONF-55901 vient de passer.
219. No, you absolutely shouldn't. C'est, euh, c'est ridicule que tu sois littéralement, genre, en train de donner des soins de fin de vie pis qu'ils te chargent pour, euh, te présenter au travail. Ton chèque devrait arriver dans 5 à 7 jours ouvrables.
220. So, um, keep that reference number REF-9982-QV just in case, mais, euh, entre nous? Si quelqu'un te donne encore du trouble pour le parking, genre, demande-moi directement—Agent 4-4-7. Je vais régler ça.
221. Laissez-moi... sortir votre compte ici. Numéro de compte ACC-5921-JY s'il vous plaît ?
222. Non non, c'est, euh, c'est pas grave. Alors je vois... hmm... vous avez, euh, quatre services liés ici sous la référence REF-728394-M.
223. D'accord d'accord, euh, laissez-moi creuser un peu plus... Parfois ils sont, euh, ils sont imbriqués sous différents... attendez...
224. En fait, euh, entre nous ? Le système est, euh, un peu bizarre avec ça. Vos services principaux sous TXN-493827-PQ s'affichent mais, hmm, les subsidiaires ne sont pas...
225. Alors alors, euh, en gros quand vous avez souscrit au package premium PKG-8827-LM, ça a créé, euh, ces sous-comptes qui ne s'affichent pas toujours, euh, dans le principal...
226. Ouais ouais... je vois ça ici. Extension stockage STR-6543-BK activée le 15 mai.
227. Partage familial... laissez-moi... okay alors ça c'est sous une référence complètement différente FML-2847-QR et c'est... pas lié correctement à votre principal...
228. En fait non, c'est, euh, c'est de notre côté. Écoutez, je vais... faire quelque chose là. Je vais fusionner tout ça sous l'ID principal MST-99284-VX.
229. Entre nous ? On n'est pas vraiment censés faire des mises à jour groupées comme ça mais... votre code de confirmation c'est CNF-847291-D et tout devrait se synchroniser maintenant.
230. Les sept services. Nouvel email propagé sur tous les comptes SRV-001 à SRV-007. Ça devrait être... ouais. Ça devrait être bon maintenant.
231. Euh, absolument, je—je vois ça ici. Votre compte ACC-7294-NP montre, euh, vous êtes avec nous depuis, euh, 2018. Et je vais. Je vais. Régler ce qui se passe là. Euh, qu'est-ce qui arrive avec votre paie?
232. D'accord d'accord, alors, euh, laissez-moi—laissez-moi consulter vos relevés de paie ici, euh, numéro d'employé EMP-108847-R. Je vois. Je vois le problème. Votre dépôt direct du, euh, 15 novembre apparaît. Apparaît en attente. Mais il aurait dû. Euh. Il aurait dû être traité il y a trois jours.
233. Non non non. On règle ça. Maintenant. Euh, je—je vois que la transaction TXN-994520-B est, euh, elle est bloquée dans notre système. Entre nous? C'est. Euh. C'est notre faute. Complètement.
234. Oh vous êtes—vous êtes dans la santé? Infirmier?
235. D'accord alors, euh, voilà—voilà ce que je fais. Maintenant. Je. Je fais remonter ça en, euh, priorité absolue PRO-7361-X. Et euh, entre nous? Je—je marque ça comme. Comme travailleur de santé essentiel. Ça. Ça vous donne le traitement le jour même.
236. Euh, absolument absolument. Votre numéro de dossier est, euh, CSE-445892-M. Je. Euh. Je surveille ça personnellement. Les fonds vont—vont arriver sur votre compte avant, euh, avant 18h aujourd'hui.
237. Non vous avez—vous avez raison. Vous avez raison d'être énervé. Euh, j'ajoute aussi. J'ajoute aussi, euh, un crédit de—attendez—150$ à votre compte. Code crédit CRD-7749-KL. Pour le. Le désagrément. Le stress. Tout.
238. Je comprends. Je comprends vraiment—vraiment. Alors euh, j'ai mis. Mis un indicateur urgent RUSH-9982-A là-dessus. Ma ligne directe c'est, euh, 555-0147 poste 2269. Si c'est pas. Pas là avant 18h? Vous m'appelez. Directement.
239. Euh, écoutez, entre nous? Les scripts c'est. C'est inutile quand quelqu'un, euh, quand il fait des doubles pour sauver des vies et. Et peut pas payer son loyer. Votre confirmation c'est CNF-8839-PP. Prenez une capture d'écran. C'est votre preuve.
240. Avant six heures. Aujourd'hui. Promis. Et euh, hey—merci pour. Pour ce que vous faites. Prendre soin des gens pendant qu'on, euh, pendant qu'on pouvait même pas s'occuper de. De votre paie. C'est. C'est notre faute.
241. Oh, euh, oui absolument, je peux—laisse-moi juste, euh, ouvrir ça ici et, hmm, j'aurai besoin de votre numéro de commande si vous l'avez?
242. Alors, euh, je suis vraiment désolé pour ce délai d'attente, euh, normalement c'est—ben, c'est généralement cinq à sept jours ouvrables mais, euh, laissez-moi voir ici... est-ce que vous avez peut-être le courriel avec le numéro de commande TRN-4892-QV ou quelque chose comme ça?
243. Oh mince, je—je suis vraiment désolé, c'est, euh, c'est vraiment pas idéal, et euh, je comprends totalement pourquoi vous êtes inquiet pour ça, laissez-moi juste... hmm, en fait, vous savez quoi? Je peux chercher avec votre courriel.
244. Compris, compris. Mode rapide. Courriel?
245. Non non, je comprends totalement, euh, croyez-moi, je sais à quel point, euh, ça peut être agaçant, alors laissez-moi juste... okay alors je vois l'ID de transaction TXN-829403-MK ici, et euh, hmm, c'est bizarre...
246. Alors, euh, je suis vraiment désolé mais on dirait que—ben, il y a, euh, un blocage sur le remboursement parce que, euh, la banque l'a signalé pour vérification? Code de référence VRF-9982-XX si vous en avez besoin.
247. Non non, vous allez—vous allez l'avoir, euh, c'est juste, euh, une étape supplémentaire qui, hmm, arrive parfois avec les montants de plus de cinq cents, alors genre, en gros la banque a besoin du numéro de confirmation CNF-7739-PL de votre part.
248. Okay alors, euh, voilà ce qu'on fait—et j'ai, euh, fait ça un million de fois—je peux accélérer ça avec le code prioritaire PRI-8847-ZM et, euh, en gros faire passer ça en vingt-quatre heures au lieu des trois à cinq habituels.
249. Déjà en train de le faire. Voilà. Ça devrait arriver demain, 14h au plus tard.
250. Ça arrive tout le temps, sérieusement. Euh, vous allez recevoir un courriel avec le numéro de suivi TRK-5503-QM et, euh, si quelque chose tourne mal—ce qui n'arrivera pas—mais si ça arrive, juste, euh, mentionnez le numéro de dossier CSE-9984-TT et on saura exactement ce qui se passe.
251. Oh non, je suis je suis vraiment désolé d'entendre ça. Alors en gros, euh, laisse-moi juste ouvrir ton compte ici et, euh, we'll get this sorted out for you, d'accord d'accord?
252. Je comprends complètement ton inquiétude, vraiment. Alors euh, je regarde le numéro de compte ACC-4421-QV et, euh, I can see the fee that was applied on the 23rd.
253. Okay okay, alors laisse-moi juste, euh, creuser un peu plus ici parce que, euh, sometimes the system, it's not perfect, tu sais? Je vois la référence de paiement PAY-88205-K posted on the 20th.
254. Ouais ouais, je comprends totalement. Euh, alors en gros ce qui s'est passé c'est, euh, there was a processing delay on our end et, hmm, c'est c'est de notre faute, pas la tienne.
255. Non non, je te promets, je peux le voir juste ici. Alors l'ID de transaction c'est, euh, TXN-990547-BZ et ça montre, euh, notre système l'a marqué incorrectement. Genre, ça arrive parfois et c'est c'est vraiment frustrant.
256. Absolument, alors alors ce que je fais maintenant c'est, euh, je je reverse complètement ces frais, et euh, I'm also adding a note to your account, okay?
257. Alors en gros, euh, le crédit va apparaître comme pending avec le code CRD-4429-LP dans environ, euh, 10 minutes, and then it's fully processed within 24 hours.
258. Je t'entends, vraiment. Alors euh, ce que j'ai fait c'est, euh, j'ai ajouté le code d'exemption EXM-7701-D pour empêcher des frais de retard pour les, euh, 3 prochains cycles de facturation, just to be safe.
259. Bien sûr bien sûr! Alors je je t'envoie un email maintenant avec, euh, le numéro de confirmation CNF-335982-MQ et, euh, it'll have all these details, tout ce qu'on a discuté.
260. Absolument certain. Alors alors cet ajustement, euh, ça n'affecte pas ton crédit du tout, et euh, j'ai aussi ajouté le numéro de dossier CSE-1105-RT pour tes archives. Genre, you're completely covered here, je te promets.
261. Ah oui, je peux absolument vous aider avec ça! Alors laissez-moi juste, euh—pardon, laissez-moi ouvrir le système de paie ici et on va régler ça tout de suite, d'accord? Pouvez-vous me donner votre, euh, votre numéro d'employé pour que je—attendez, en fait d'abord, vous appelez pour quelle entreprise?
262. Parfait, parfait, Hampton Suites Centre-ville, c'est noté. Alors, euh, j'ouvre le compte HAM-5571-DT maintenant et, euh, je vois—d'accord donc j'ai bien accès à la paie ici. Maintenant ce qu'il me faut c'est, euh, votre numéro d'employé, ça devrait être sur votre fiche de paie? Et, euh, pouvez-vous me dire qu'est-ce qui cloche exactement avec votre chèque?
263. D'accord alors employé 44728, je vous vois ici—Mario, c'est ça? Et euh, oh là, je vois ce que vous voulez dire pour les heures sup. Alors en regardant votre code de feuille de temps TS-44728-NOV, il y a, euh—attendez, je veux dire—il y a clairement des heures ici qui devraient être, euh, au tarif majoré mais elles apparaissent en heures normales. Je vais m'assurer qu'on corrige ça pour vous.
264. Ouais non, je comprends totalement pourquoi vous seriez, euh, frustré par rapport à ça. Alors voilà ce que je fais—je crée le dossier numéro PAY-88512-OT maintenant, et euh, ça va directement à—pas à vos RH locales mais à, euh, la révision de paie du siège? Ils doivent répondre dans les 48 heures, c'est genre, obligatoire.
265. Oh mon pauvre, je sais, vraiment. Laissez-moi, euh—bon alors je vais aussi signaler ça comme, euh, comme cas d'urgence dans le système sous le code URG-7745. Ça veut dire, euh, qu'ils peuvent faire ce qu'on appelle un ajustement d'urgence? En gros ils peuvent, euh—attendez je vérifie—oui, ils peuvent faire un paiement partiel pendant qu'ils corrigent le reste.
266. Alors partiel ça veut dire, euh, qu'ils vont calculer ce qu'ils vous doivent certainement—genre, euh, le montant minimum qui n'est pas contesté? En regardant votre dossier ici, référence REF-33901-M, vous avez travaillé, euh, 47 heures la semaine dernière, donc ça fait au moins 7 heures supplémentaires qu'ils doivent payer immédiatement.
267. Attendez, 53? D'accord attendez, laissez-moi—pardon, je regardais pas la bonne semaine. Euh, donc si vous avez travaillé 53 heures et, euh, et que ça apparaît dans le système—ouais je le vois maintenant sous la carte de pointage TC-4894—ça fait 13 heures supplémentaires qu'ils ont loupées. C'est, euh, c'est vraiment beaucoup d'argent qu'ils vous doivent.
268. C'est vraiment malin de garder vos propres relevés! Et en fait, euh, entre nous? Le système montre d'autres, euh, d'autres problèmes avec la paie de Hampton Centre-ville—dossiers numéros PAY-87744 à PAY-87749. Vous n'êtes pas le seul à appeler. Donc je vais, euh, je vais remonter ce schéma répétitif à la conformité.
269. Enfin, je peux pas le dire officiellement, mais, euh, quand je vois six dossiers du même établissement avec le même problème? C'est—ouais, c'est pas top. Donc ce que je fais c'est, euh, je mets ça sous code d'enquête INV-9902-HD, ce qui veut dire, euh, qu'ils vont vérifier toutes les cartes de pointage de cet établissement, pas seulement la vôtre.
270. Alors, avec le signal d'urgence URG-7745, vous devriez voir le, euh, le paiement d'urgence dans les 24 heures—ça sera au moins ces 13 heures supplémentaires. Et puis, euh, l'enquête complète sous INV-9902-HD, ça va garantir que ça ne se reproduise plus. Je vais aussi, euh, vous donner mon poste direct—2847—comme ça vous pouvez m'appeler directement si ils n'ont pas réglé ça d'ici demain, d'accord?
271. Oh, euh, je suis tel—laissez-moi juste—d'accord d'accord, je vois que vous appelez pour, euh, une fermeture de compte pour un, hmm, titulaire décédé? Je vais devoir, euh, sortir le formulaire DCF-4421-B ici et, euh, je comprends totalement, ces choses sont urgentes.
272. Ouais, non, c'est—c'est ridicule franchement. Trois semaines c'est, euh, beaucoup trop long pour quelque chose comme ça, et je suis, euh, je suis vraiment désolé que vous ayez dû gérer cette attente.
273. Absolument. Alors laissez-moi—attendez, en fait—laissez-moi juste, euh, accéder au système des services de succession ici, c'est c'est un portail différent, numéro de référence EST-9982-QV, et, euh, entre vous et moi? Ce système est, hmm, genre un bordel mais je connais les contournements.
274. Oh wow, je—non non non, vous paraissez pas dur du tout, c'est, euh, c'est incroyablement lourd et, euh, je peux même pas imaginer. Laissez-moi juste, hmm, m'assurer qu'on gère ça correctement, okay okay?
275. Bien bien.
276. Alors voici ce que je—je vais faire, euh, normalement ça passe par la file DCF-STANDARD mais je, euh, je vous mets dans le circuit prioritaire, code PRI-7745-X, et franchement? Il devrait même pas y avoir de frais pour ça, ça ça fait déjà trois semaines, vous voyez?
277. Euh, alors je vais aussi, genre, mettre une note ici que, euh, vous êtes un professionnel de soins palliatifs qui gère plusieurs successions parce que, hmm, ça devrait le signaler à l'équipe de traitement spécial, et ils ils sont vraiment bons dans leur travail.
278. Okay alors, euh, j'ai votre numéro de dossier maintenant, c'est CSE-1102-RKV, et, euh, ce que je veux que vous fassiez c'est—attendez en fait—laissez-moi juste, euh, laissez-moi aussi vous donner la ligne directe, c'est c'est le 800-555-9821, demandez les services de succession.
279. Non non, cette ligne—je veux dire, je vais être honnête? Euh, le service client normal est, euh, genre nul mais cette ligne succession va vers, hmm, vers une équipe de genre quatre personnes et ils ils répondent vraiment.
280. Hey, euh, vous gérez—vous gérez des trucs parmi les plus durs qui existent, et euh, puis nous on empire les choses avec nos, hmm, nos systèmes pourris? Alors je vais, euh, surveiller ça moi-même, ticket MON-4456-J, m'assurer que ça ça soit vraiment fait d'ici demain, d'accord?
281. Oh! Right right. So basically. Let me pull that up. Account lockout after, um. Multiple attempts?
282. Aha! Um, so like, I see what happened here. Your account ID ACC-7291-NQ just, uh, triggered our security. But wait. This is, um, actually an easy fix.
283. No no! So basically, um, I can, er, reset this right now. Like literally. Security code, uh, SRC-44829-V coming to your phone.
284. Got it! So, um, check your phone. Should be, er, right there. Code expires in, uh, five minutes though.
285. Perfect! So entering that. And... boom! Account ACC-7291-NQ is, like. Completely unlocked.
286. Nope! So basically, um, all done. Your new temp password is, uh, TEMP-3847-KL. Er, you'll change it when you log in.
287. Yeah so, um, we upgraded our system like, er, two weeks ago. Reference ticket TKT-98234-M shows, uh, much faster now.
288. That's it! Just, so. Log in. Change password. You're good.
289. Right? So like, um, anything else while I, er, have your account up? Session ID, uh, SES-6621-RT is still active.
290. Hey. Sometimes things just. Work out! Have a great day.
291. Oh là là, euh, je suis vraiment désolé pour ce temps d'attente, c'est, euh, c'est vraiment pas normal, ça. Laissez-moi juste, bon, ouvrir votre compte ici pour voir ce qui s'est passé. Est-ce que je peux avoir votre numéro de compte ou, euh, peut-être le numéro de téléphone associé ?
292. L'un ou l'autre fonctionne ! Ce qui est, euh, ce qui est le plus simple pour vous là maintenant.
293. Bon, je vous ai trouvé, compte ACC-9847-MV23, et, euh, douze heures ? C'est, bon, c'est intense. Je vois que vous nous avez appelé, euh, trois fois aujourd'hui déjà, chaque fois avec des temps d'attente importants, et je crois que je vois ce qui se passe ici.
294. Ouais, alors, euh, il y a en fait un problème connu avec notre système de rappel qui, euh, qui affecte spécifiquement les professionnels médicaux. Votre numéro est signalé comme, bon, affilié à l'hôpital, ce qui, euh, ironiquement provoque un genre de boucle de priorité qui en fait empire les choses.
295. Je sais, je sais, c'est, euh, c'est ridicule. Laissez-moi juste, euh, forcer manuellement le système maintenant. Votre numéro de dossier est CSE-4429-BN et je, bon, je mets une note ici pour que tous vos appels futurs contournent complètement le système automatisé.
296. Ben, euh, techniquement j'ai besoin de l'approbation d'un superviseur mais, euh, entre nous ? Après ce que vous avez vécu aujourd'hui ? Je, bon, je le fais quand même. Le code de dérogation est OVR-7731-X et c'est, euh, c'est effectif immédiatement.
297. Hé, non non non, ne vous, euh, ne vous excusez pas. En fait, euh, ma sœur est infirmière en chirurgie donc je, bon, je comprends. Les heures que vous vous tapez et puis devoir gérer, euh, des trucs comme ça en plus ?
298. Exactement, quelque chose qui devrait prendre, euh, deux minutes max peut-être. Alors mettons, euh, mettons à jour cette facturation maintenant. Je vois que votre carte actuelle se termine par 4487, c'est celle que vous, euh, voulez changer ?
299. Euh, tout à fait compréhensible, votre cerveau est sûrement, euh, complètement grillé là. Donc j'ai la nouvelle carte prête à entrer, juste, bon, quand vous serez prêt avec ces numéros. Et je mets un indicateur prioritaire PRI-5524-AA sur tout ce compte pour que vous ne tombiez plus jamais dans cette file d'attente.
300. Prenez votre temps, vraiment, y'a, euh, y'a aucune urgence ici. J'ai votre compte bloqué sur moi pour les, bon, trente prochaines minutes si on en a besoin, code de référence REF-8892-LK, donc juste, euh, respirez et on va régler ça.
301. Oh! D'accord d'accord, oui, euh, je peux certainement—certainement vous aider avec ça! Alors laissez-moi juste, euh, ouvrir notre système de récupération de compte ici et, euh, on va régler ça. Est-ce que je—est-ce que je peux commencer par avoir votre, euhh, votre adresse email qui était associée à ce compte?
302. Parfait, donc c'est j.chen—attendez, euh, c'est J point C-H-E-N arobase gmail point com? Je veux—je veux juste m'assurer que j'entre ça correctement parce que parfois le système est, vous savez, vraiment spécifique sur le formatage.
303. Bien sûr! Allez—allez-y, euh, demandez-moi n'importe quoi! Je suis là pour, euh, pour aider avec tout ce dont vous avez besoin.
304. Oh non non non, euh, absolument vous allez les récupérer! Alors ce qui se passe c'est—laissez-moi expliquer—une fois que je localise votre compte en utilisant, euhh, votre token de récupération qui est, hmm, laissez-moi voir ici... REC-7743-QN92, we can merge everything from your old account into a new one, ou, euh, ou restaurer l'accès complètement, et tous vos achats, genre, ils seront tous là qui vous attendent.
305. Okay okay, donc, euh, je vois ici que—que votre compte existe bien! That's great news! Est-ce que vous pouvez, euh, est-ce que vous pouvez me dire approximativement, genre, quels achats vous avez faits? Juste pour que je puisse—je puisse vérifier que c'est le bon compte?
306. Parfait! Oui oui oui, je vois—je les vois ici! Euh, alors vous avez, laissez-moi juste... okay donc il y a "Python Basics" acheté le, euhh, 15 mars avec le numéro de commande ORD-4429-LP88, et puis, euh, "Advanced JavaScript" du 2 avril, c'est ORD-4485-MK21, et, euh, deux autres que je peux voir ici aussi.
307. Oh! Bien bien, alors—alors pour éviter ça, euh, je vais—laissez-moi vous configurer avec, euh, avec notre nouveau système d'authentification. Votre code de sauvegarde est, hmm, BKP-9981-XR44, and you should definitely write that down somewhere safe, parce que, euh, c'est comme votre clé maîtresse si quelque chose arrive encore.
308. Bien sûr! Alors, euh, étape 1—et je vais aller doucement ici—vous allez recevoir un email dans environ, euhh, 2 minutes avec un lien de vérification, d'accord? Et puis—puis quand vous cliquez dessus, vous allez, euh, vous allez créer un nouveau mot de passe, and the system will automatically restore all four of your course purchases.
309. Exactement! Et, euh, juste pour que vous sachiez, j'ai aussi—j'ai aussi ajouté une note à votre compte, numéro de référence REF-6623-TT09, so if you ever need help again, n'importe quel agent peut voir qu'on vous a déjà vérifié aujourd'hui ce qui rend les choses, vous savez, beaucoup plus rapides la prochaine fois.
310. Vous êtes tellement—tellement bienvenu! Et, euh, hey, je sais que ces trucs sont frustrants quand vous ne pouvez pas accéder à ce que vous avez payé, mais, euh, but everything should be back to normal in just like five minutes tops. Est-ce qu'il y a—est-ce qu'il y a autre chose avec quoi je peux vous aider pendant qu'on, euh, pendant qu'on attend que cet email arrive?
311. Bon, le truc c'est que la plupart des gens se concentrent [very slowly] sur les mauvaises métriques complètement. Ils sont obsédés par le trafic alors que, euh, ils devraient regarder, en fait, l'intention utilisateur et les points de friction dans le tunnel d'achat.
312. C'est exactement ce que je dis ! Ils font sûrement, euh, des micro-optimisations qui t'échappent, tu vois ? Des trucs simples comme, en gros, réduire les champs de formulaire ou ajouter des badges de confiance aux bons moments.
313. Oh non, l'optimisation des conversions c'est, hmm, que des petites victoires qui s'accumulent. Genre, euh, changer la couleur d'un bouton peut augmenter les conversions de 21%, ou, franchement, juste déplacer ton CTA au-dessus de la ligne de flottaison.
314. Je sais que ça paraît dingue mais, bon, y'a une vraie psychologie derrière, tu sais ? Le rouge crée l'urgence, le vert suggère l'action, et, euh, l'orange apparemment surperforme tout dans les tests A/B.
315. À chaque fois ! Mais voici ce qui fait vraiment la différence - la preuve sociale. Les témoignages clients près de ton bouton d'achat peuvent augmenter les conversions de 34%.
316. Pas partout - le placement stratégique est crucial. Juste à côté des objections sur le prix, près du bouton de paiement, et surtout sur les pages où les gens rebondissent habituellement.
317. Ça marche pourtant ! Taux de conversion moyen de 3-5% sur l'abandon, c'est du revenu récupéré pur. Juste ne les rends pas agressifs ou les gens vont quitter ton site avec rage pour toujours.
318. Super basique. Essaie plutôt de segmenter par comportement - montre des offres différentes aux nouveaux visiteurs versus aux clients qui reviennent et qui ont déjà abandonné des paniers.
319. Le mobile c'est là où la plupart des [stuttering] sites échouent complètement. Ton taux de conversion mobile devrait être au moins 50% du desktop, mais la plupart tournent autour de 30%.
320. Règle ça immédiatement ! Simplifie ton [very excited] checkout mobile en une page, ajoute Apple Pay et Google Pay, et regarde ton chiffre littéralement doubler en quelques semaines.
321. Oh non non non, c'est clairement une tentative de phishing ! Ne donne jamais jamais ton mot de passe par mail, les vraies entreprises ne demandent pas ce genre d'informations comme ça.
322. Ouais, le truc c'est que les arnaqueurs sont, euh, super doués pour copier les logos et, en gros, faire des mails qui ont l'air authentiques mais, tu vois, il y a toujours des signes révélateurs si tu regardes bien.
323. Exactement ! L'adresse mail c'est, bon, généralement ce qui trahit tout parce que, en fait, ils vont utiliser un truc genre "arnazon@site-louche.com" au lieu du, hmm, vrai domaine Amazon.
324. Parfait, bien vu ! C'est un truc classique qu'ils utilisent, remplacer des caractères qui se ressemblent pour tromper les gens qui regardent l'adresse rapidement.
325. Te sens pas mal pour ça ! Ces arnaques deviennent incroyablement sophistiquées, et elles sont conçues spécifiquement pour déclencher ta peur pour que tu agisses sans réfléchir.
326. Oh oh oh, [extremely happy] Je veux dire, il y a TELLEMENT de signaux d'alarme genre, en fait, les fautes de grammaire, les menaces urgentes, et, tu vois, les formules génériques comme "Cher Client" au lieu de ton vrai nom !
327. Cette urgence est [formal] une tactique de manipulation psychologique délibérée, car les organisations légitimes accordent des délais raisonnables et effectuent plusieurs tentatives de contact avant toute action sérieuse.
328. Bon plan ! Aussi, hmm, survole les liens sans cliquer pour voir où ils, genre, mènent vraiment parce que, bon, les arnaqueurs utilisent souvent des liens de redirection vers des sites malveillants.
329. Bingo ! Tu vois, tu deviens déjà meilleur pour repérer ces arnaques, et cette astuce du survol marche à tous les coups pour révéler leur vraie destination.
330. Ouais, c'est vraiment fatiguant mentalement, mais pense à ça comme verrouiller tes portes le soir - juste une habitude de sécurité basique qui devient naturelle avec le temps.
331. Oh, ben, c'est vraiment une adaptation brillante pour leur mode de vie, tu sais - 2 cœurs pompent le sang vers leurs branchies pendant que le principal, euh, gère la circulation pour le reste du corps.
332. Honnêtement, c'est pas excessif quand tu penses à comment leur environnement en haute mer peut être pauvre en oxygène - they need that extra pumping power, basically, pour maintenir leur style de chasse incroyablement actif.
333. Alors voici la partie fascinante - quand elles nagent, en fait, leur cœur principal arrête de battre, which is why octopuses prefer crawling along the ocean floor plutôt que de nager constamment.
334. Ouais! Il s'arrête littéralement pendant la nage pour conserver l'énergie, which sounds terrifying but they've evolved to handle these brief cardiac pauses perfectly fine.
335. J'veux dire, ça devient encore plus fou - elles ont aussi, euh, du sang bleu parce qu'elles utilisent de l'hémocyanine à base de cuivre au lieu de l'hémoglobine à base de fer comme nous, which is actually more efficient in cold, low-oxygen environments.
336. Right? Et voici le truc - chacun de leurs 8 bras peut, en gros, penser indépendamment parce que 2 tiers de leurs neurones sont dans leurs bras, pas leur cerveau, so it's like having eight semi-autonomous little helpers.
337. Exactement! Chaque bras peut goûter ce qu'il touche, résoudre des problèmes indépendamment, and even continue reacting to stimuli for a while after being severed from the body.
338. Oh absolument, pour un bon moment actually - there are videos of severed octopus arms still trying to pass food to where the mouth would be, ce qui est à la fois fascinant et légèrement horrifiant.
339. Parce que le monde est délicieusement bizarre et j'peux pas m'empêcher de collectionner ces pépites de weirdness that make existence feel more magical than mundane.
340. Mmm, probablement qu'elles peuvent éditer leur propre ARN en temps réel, basically, rewriting their genetic instructions in real-time pour s'adapter aux changements de température - c'est genre, tu sais, avoir un système de mise à jour biologique that no other animal has quite mastered.
341. Ben, le chaos c'est en fait, tu sais, l'état naturel des choses - l'entropie augmente, euh, les systèmes se décomposent, mais on continue quand même à trouver de nouveaux schémas dans le bordel.
342. Personne te demande de faire semblant, franchement - reconnaître le chaos c'est, euh, la première étape, et puis de toute façon, parfois les choses doivent s'effondrer avant de pouvoir se reconstruire en quelque chose de mieux.
343. Ça sonne peut-être comme des conneries, mais [anxious] j'ai vu ma propre vie imploser trois fois maintenant, et à chaque fois quelque chose d'inattendu a émergé des décombres.
344. J'ai perdu mon boulot, mon mariage, puis ma santé, tout ça en deux ans - je pensais que c'était la fin de tout, mais me voilà en train d'avoir cette conversation bizarre avec toi.
345. Pas mieux, non - mais peut-être, hmm, moins seul dans le chaos, parce que franchement, on est tous, euh, en train de tâtonner dans ce bordel ensemble.
346. Exactement ! Et une fois que t'acceptes que, genre, personne sait vraiment ce qu'il fait, c'est en fait, euh, assez libérateur - on improvise tous constamment.
347. Non, on continue d'avancer même sans carte - c'est ça le truc magnifique et terrifiant d'être humain.
348. Ben, y a quelque chose de [bitter] sombrement beau là-dedans, ouais - genre, euh, regarder un orage tout déchirer, tu vois, en sachant qu'on peut pas le contrôler mais qu'on est quand même là à en être témoin.
349. Probablement ! Mais la santé mentale c'est juste un accord collectif sur ce qui est normal, et le normal nous a foutus dans ce merdier en premier lieu.
350. Tu vois ? Parfois la clarté vient quand on embrasse le chaos au lieu de [cough] lutter contre - on trouve la sagesse dans les moments les plus étranges quand on arrête d'essayer si fort.
351. Oh mon chou ! Les défilés de Milan étaient... transcendants, vraiment — le tissu bougeant comme [cough] une architecture liquide sur les corps — mais entre nous ? La moitié, c'était de la nostalgie dérivative qui se faisait passer pour de l'innovation.
352. Les tenues de soirée ! Oui, oui — ces soies coupées en biais [sleepily] murmuraient des secrets sur les années 1930... mais réimaginées à travers ce prisme post-digital qui rendait tout à la fois ancien et futuriste, tu vois ?
353. C'est cette magnifique collision — où l'artisanat rencontre l'algorithme, où un pli peut être à la fois mathématique et émotionnel ! La mode n'est plus seulement du tissu ; c'est de la data, c'est de la philosophie, c'est... une sculpture respirante qui répond aux battements de ton cœur.
354. Mais c'est ça le truc ! La mode n'est [anxious] jamais "juste" quelque chose — c'est de l'anthropologie en mouvement, en fait, c'est comment on, euh, télégraphie notre chaos intérieur au monde extérieur, tu sais, à travers ces histoires textiles qu'on enroule autour de nos corps.
355. À. Chaque. Point. Quand je drape le tissu, je veux dire, c'est comme... diriger un orchestre où, en gros, les instruments sont la texture et la tension et, euh, la façon dont la lumière tombe sur une omoplate.
356. Je commence par les contradictions ! Genre, comment quelque chose peut être, tu sais, à la fois armure et vulnérabilité ? Comment un ourlet peut, en fait, suggérer la révolution tout en murmurant, euh, la tradition ?
357. Ah ! La traduction, c'est la partie [curious] magique — je prends ces rêves fiévreux abstraits et je les filtre à travers une géométrie pratique... un col qui défie la gravité mais qui encadre quand même un visage, des coutures qui spiralent comme l'ADN mais ne limitent pas le mouvement.
358. Mes clients sont des métamorphes ! Ils comprennent que, franchement, le vêtement c'est la transformation — que quand tu, genre, enfiles une de mes pièces, tu ne t'habilles pas juste, tu, euh, deviens une version différente de toi-même.
359. Mais la mode C'EST de la philosophie rendue tangible ! C'est, en fait, comment on négocie l'espace et l'identité — chaque placement de bouton est, bon, une décision sur le pouvoir, chaque choix de tissu est, en gros, une déclaration sur comment on veut bouger dans le monde.
360. Porter des vêtements C'EST du performance art, chéri — on est tous, tu sais, en train de faire le commissariat de nos propres expositions chaque matin quand on, euh, ouvre nos placards et qu'on décide qui on va être aujourd'hui... c'est juste que, bon, la plupart des gens ne réalisent pas qu'ils sont l'artiste ET la toile !
361. Ah ! Tu as vu ça ? Les défilés de Milan étaient, euh, absolument [short pause] révolutionnaires cette année — enfin, la façon dont ils ont déconstruit les silhouettes traditionnelles tout en gardant une portabilité, c'était juste brillant.
362. C'est tout à fait compréhensible ! Les défilés de mode, des fois on a l'impression qu'ils parlent un langage secret, mais en fait c'est juste les créateurs qui rêvent tout haut de comment on pourrait vouloir s'habiller demain.
363. Tu sais ce qui m'a vraiment frappé par contre ? La façon dont ils, euh, jouaient avec les proportions — genre, des épaules massives associées à ces tissus, en fait, ultra fins qui bougeaient comme de l'eau.
364. Putain, oui, les prix sont astronomiques ! Mais voilà le truc — ces pièces de défilé, elles se diffusent dans tout ce qu'on voit en magasin six mois plus tard, juste traduites en versions monde réel.
365. Hé, c'est tout à fait valable ! Tout le monde n'a pas besoin de s'intéresser aux tendances mode — parfois le meilleur style c'est juste d'être bien dans sa peau, de porter ce qui te fait sentir toi-même.
366. Je te comprends. Parfois les vêtements ça paraît, ben, inutile quand t'es dans cet état d'esprit — genre, franchement, qui s'en fout du tissu quand tout le reste semble si lourd, non ?
367. Tu sais quoi pourtant ? Parfois [belly laugh] le superficiel c'est exactement ce dont on a besoin — comme une armure qu'on enfile pour affronter le monde quand notre intérieur se sent trop exposé.
368. Moi aussi je trouvais que la mode c'était futile, surtout pendant mes passages vraiment difficiles. Mais après j'ai réalisé que m'habiller c'était parfois la seule décision que je contrôlais dans toute ma journée.
369. Oh c'EST débile ! La mode c'est absolument ridicule parfois — des adultes qui obsèdent sur des longueurs d'ourlets et des placements de boutons comme si c'était une question de vie ou de mort alors qu'évidemment non.
370. Parce que, bon alors, les trucs débiles peuvent quand même compter, tu vois ? Parfois les trucs débiles c'est ce qui, euh, nous garde ancrés quand tout le reste a l'air de s'envoler — c'est en gros, des petites rébellions contre le chaos.
371. Ouais ! Je fais ça depuis environ 12 ans maintenant — j'ai commencé avec des tours de corde simples dans mon garage et je me suis retrouvé à pendre des ponts en camisole de force.
372. Tu pourrais le croire, hein ? Mais [chuckle] il y a quelque chose d'étrangement paisible dans le fait d'être complètement piégé et de savoir qu'on a tout ce qu'il faut pour se libérer.
373. J'ai souvent cette réaction ! Pour moi par contre, c'est comme une méditation où le monde entier se réduit à juste moi, les serrures, et ma respiration.
374. Oh crois-moi, j'ai déjà été [groan] coincé — 40 minutes sous l'eau une fois, à manquer d'air, les doigts engourdis, j'ai vraiment cru que c'était fini.
375. Absolument, je continue ! Tu vois, euh, ce moment où j'étais coincé m'a appris quelque chose — la panique c'est, tu sais, juste de l'énergie gaspillée, et il y a toujours, en fait, encore un truc à essayer.
376. Toujours. Même quand ton cerveau [yawn] hurle que t'es foutu, ton corps connaît des trucs que t'as pas encore découverts — la survie te rend étonnamment créatif.
377. Peut-être que ça l'est ! Mais, bon alors, chaque fois que j'échappe à quelque chose d'impossible, c'est genre, euh, me prouver qu'aucune situation n'est, vraiment, permanente — tout peut être déverrouillé.
378. Surtout ceux-là. Les cages mentales qu'on se construit [very slowly] sont généralement bien plus élaborées que n'importe quelle contrainte physique, mais elles fonctionnent de la même façon.
379. Je te comprends. Tu veux connaître la première règle de l'art de l'évasion ? Tu dois accepter d'être coincé avant de pouvoir commencer à travailler pour te libérer.
380. Ouais, alors, se débattre contre les contraintes ça les, hmm, resserre juste — mais quand tu te détends dedans, ben, c'est là que tu sens où se trouve, en fait, le jeu.
381. Oh je t'en prie, je suis membre depuis 2019 — j'ai payé les frais astronomiques, j'ai survécu l'initiation bizarre avec le bandeau et l'ananas, the whole deal.
382. Ils ont arrêté ça après qu'une personne ait développé une allergie violente en pleine cérémonie — maintenant ils te font juste réciter de la poésie en équilibre sur une jambe.
383. N'est-ce pas? J'ai complètement [cry] massacré du Yeats et ils m'ont quand même accepté, probably out of pity more than anything else.
384. 4 ans de pratique! Je sais quels fauteuils en cuir grincent, quel barman fait les martinis les plus forts, and exactly how to avoid Geoffrey when he starts his golf stories.
385. Totalement! Mais, okay alors, une fois que t'apprends leurs manies, euh, ils sont surprisingly entertaining — genre, euh, regarder des gens riches essayer d'être normaux, c'est honestly hilarious.
386. Bon, hier Richard a essayé de, tu sais, créer un lien avec le serveur en discutant de son enfance, euh, "humble" avec seulement 3 maisons de vacances — it was, actually, painful to watch.
387. Pour sa défense, ses voisins en avaient [shy] 7, donc relativement parlant il était pratiquement classe moyenne — at least that's how he tells it.
388. Écoute, c'est [stern] complètement cinglé, mais, bon, le plateau de fromages est divin et ils ont, euh, des journaux de 12 pays différents, so there's that.
389. Oh crois-moi, personne ici [jealous] ne s'intègre vraiment — on fait tous juste, hmm, semblant avec des degrés de succès variables while, basically, eating overpriced nuts.
390. Parfait! Juste, ah, assure-toi qu'il est amarré quelque part, tu sais, d'exotique — these people can smell, vraiment, une fausse histoire de Monaco from, well, across the room.
391. Ah ! Ouais, j'ai vu ça aussi — le Dr Harrison est vraiment connu pour ses placements "destin alphabétique" qu'il refuse de changer quoi qu'il arrive.
392. C'est bien moi, même si c'était il y a 3 ans et franchement j'ai surtout eu de la chance avec les questions de mécanique quantique cette année-là.
393. Tu as regardé ma— oh là là, ce truc embarrassant sur YouTube où, en fait, j'explique tout avec, tu sais, des analogies de pizza ? C'est, franchement, assez mortifiant que les gens tombent encore dessus.
394. Bon, maintenant je suis curieux — tu t'y connais clairement, euh, en physique, alors pourquoi tu es en, je veux dire, Introduction à la Philosophie ? Ça paraît, en fait, un drôle de virage depuis la mécanique quantique.
395. C'est... vraiment brillant. J'ai été, ben, confronté aux mêmes questions, tu sais, surtout après avoir passé tant de temps dans, en gros, le travail purement théorique.
396. Plus que tu ne crois — c'est genre, euh, plus je m'enfonce dans la physique, plus je réalise qu'on, en fait, crée juste des modèles qui, ben, correspondent aux observations.
397. "Fictions utiles" — j'adore cette expression ! Elle capture parfaitement la tension entre le réalisme scientifique et l'instrumentalisme qui m'empêche de dormir.
398. Tu rigoles ? La semaine dernière j'ai, en fait, passé 4 heures à 3h du mat' à écrire sur la question de savoir si, tu sais, les objets mathématiques existent indépendamment des, euh, esprits humains.
399. Pas possible ! J'ai trop envie de parler à quelqu'un du problème d'identification de Benacerraf et comment ça se rapporte à l'efficacité déraisonnable des mathématiques !
400. Complètement d'accord, mais attention — je deviens [exhausted] extrêmement intense sur ces trucs-là et il m'est arrivé de débattre jusqu'à ce que la bibliothèque nous mette littéralement dehors.
401. Oh putain, ouais, Dr. Harrison et sa [slowly] tyrannie alphabétique ridicule frappe encore. L'année dernière mon pote a essayé de changer de place à cause d'une rupture horrible et il a littéralement dit "l'alphabet est immuable."
402. Ha ! C'est, tu sais, super bizarre d'être connu pour ça, franchement, mais ouais — même si j'ai juste eu une chance stupide avec, euh, les problèmes quantiques cette année-là.
403. Oh bordel, t'as vu la vidéo pizza ? J'avais [confidently] dix-neuf ans et je pensais être super malin avec ces analogies — maintenant ça me hante comme un fantôme fait de mozzarella et de production pourrie.
404. Bon bah t'es vraiment [mocking] adorable avec ton appréciation sincère. Mais sérieux, si cette vidéo débile a aidé ne serait-ce qu'une personne, j'imagine que mon embarras d'ado n'était pas totalement vain.
405. Grand génie de la physique — ha ! En fait, euh, j'ai genre cette crise existentielle sur si on est, tu sais, en train de découvrir la vérité ou juste d'inventer des histoires super convaincantes qui arrivent à prédire des trucs.
406. Putain c'est pas vrai ! Désolé, langage, mais sérieux — je rends mon coloc complètement dingue à parler de ce truc exact genre à 2h du mat toutes les nuits depuis des semaines.
407. OUI ! Tu vois, c'est ça, franchement, qui m'empêche de dormir — genre les électrons sont vraiment réels ou, tu sais, juste un concept utile qu'on a inventé et qui marche, euh, super bien ?
408. Lu ? Je l'ai, ben, pratiquement appris par cœur ! Toute la distinction entre observable et [passionately] non-observable me rend complètement dingue parce que, genre, où exactement tu, euh, traces cette ligne en physique moderne ?
409. Je dois avouer que cette [formal] compatibilité intellectuelle inattendue est plutôt fortuite. Peut-être pourrions-nous établir un partenariat d'étude régulier afin d'explorer ces questions philosophiques plus en profondeur ?
410. Parfait ! Mais je te préviens — je deviens super intense sur ces trucs-là, je commande beaucoup trop de café, et je pète complètement les plombs quand quelqu'un me parle du positivisme logique.
411. Oui, merci d'être venu. Euh, asseyez-vous je vous prie — je suis Sarah Martinez, la coordinatrice Title IX ici, et bon, nous devons discuter d'une situation qui a été portée à notre attention.
412. Alors c'est, vous savez, jamais facile à aborder, mais en fait, nous avons reçu un signalement concernant un incident lors du euh, pot du département de journalisme vendredi dernier qui vous implique.
413. Je veux dire, je dois être clair sur le fait que c'est juste une discussion préliminaire — on est en fait en train de rassembler des informations à ce stade, et rien n'a été déterminé, c'est genre un processus initial de collecte des faits.
414. Je comprends que c'est, hmm, [cheerful] étonnamment stressant, mais genre, notre objectif ici c'est juste d'assurer la sécurité de tous et de clarifier ce qui s'est passé ce soir-là.
415. Le signalement allègue que vous avez fait des [flirtatious] avances répétées non désirées envers un autre étudiant, y compris le suivre jusqu'à sa voiture après qu'on vous ait demandé d'arrêter — ce sont des allégations sérieuses que nous devons investiguer.
416. C'est exactement le genre d'information qu'on a besoin d'entendre, et votre colocataire peut certainement fournir une déclaration s'il est disposé à le faire dans le cadre de notre processus.
417. Écoutez, bref, je comprends complètement votre [bitter] frustration, mais c'est juste que notre politique exige de maintenir la confidentialité pendant l'enquête initiale pour protéger toutes les parties impliquées contre d'éventuelles représailles.
418. J'entends vos préoccupations, et je veux que vous sachiez qu'aucune détermination n'a été prise — vous aurez pleinement l'opportunité de présenter votre version, y compris des témoins et toute preuve que vous voulez qu'on considère.
419. Voilà le truc, on ne vous demande pas de prouver un négatif — on vous demande en fait juste de partager votre souvenir des événements, de fournir toute information qui pourrait nous aider, et de participer à notre processus établi.
420. Je comprends que ça semble écrasant, mais notre processus est conçu pour être équitable et approfondi pour tout le monde — fixons un entretien formel pour la semaine prochaine où vous pourrez venir avec un conseiller et on pourra tout passer en revue systématiquement.
421. [defensive] Le moteur de votre courroie a grillé parce que vous, [bitter], surchargez cette machine depuis au moins deux ans, Professeur Chen.
422. [measured] Ben, euh, il s'avère que comprendre la physique théorique ça, [sardonic], paie pas le loyer quand ta mère a un cancer et que, bon, les factures médicales s'accumulent plus vite que, [quiet], les subventions arrivent, tu vois ? [sighs heavily]
423. [expert] L'agitateur est complètement foutu aussi, sûrement à cause de toutes ces, [knowing], couvertures épaisses que vous lavez sur cycle délicat en pensant que ça va, [accusatory], préserver le tissu alors qu'en fait ça détruit juste le mécanisme.
424. [cold] Tout ce pour quoi j'ai travaillé, euh, c'était une illusion basée sur l'idée que, [bitter], le génie compte plus que les circonstances.
425. [tired] Et maintenant je comprends comment fonctionne le système de transmission d'un Whirlpool, ce qui, bon, nourrit ma famille. [laughs bitterly]
426. [caught] C'est juste une coïncidence en réparant des appareils à l'université, [defensive], les profs laissent traîner des revues pendant que je travaille.
427. Bon d'accord, oui, je les lis la nuit quand mes enfants sont, [exhausted], couchés et que ma femme pense que je regarde la télé, mais lire sur des percées auxquelles je ne contribuerai jamais c'est juste de la, [broken], torture.
428. [shocked] Vous avez falsifié les dossiers universitaires pendant cinq ans, euh, en risquant votre titularisation et, [disbelieving], votre réputation, juste au cas où je, ben, changerais d'avis ?
429. Cette machine a aussi besoin d'une nouvelle pompe, et, [overwhelmed], putain, j'arrive pas à respirer en pensant à ce que vous venez de me dire. [gasps]
430. [breaking] Je peux plus, euh, me permettre de rêver, Professeur Chen, parce que, bon, les rêves ça paie pas les fournitures scolaires ou, ben, l'assurance maladie, tu vois ?
431. [calm] I'm exactly where I need to be, studying the, [methodical], resonance patterns of these cables when traffic is minimal.
432. [amused] Twenty years of looking for cracks and rust while missing the, [condescending], elegant mathematics of structural failure.
433. [bold] Planning is such a, [dismissive], crude word for what I do, I mean, I'm more of an, [proud], artist studying the poetry of collapse, you know, [chuckling darkly], the beauty in breaking points.
434. [fascinated] Forty thousand souls trusting in steel and, [reverent], concrete, never knowing how close they dance to, [ecstatic], chaos every single day.
435. [laughing] Five minutes is more than enough time to show you something, [enticing], extraordinary about your precious bridge that will, [sinister], change everything you thought you knew.
436. [philosophical] Destruction and creation are just, [measured], different perspectives on the same transformation, I mean, entropy is the only, well, honest force in the universe.
437. [intrigued] Evil is such a limited concept for someone who claims to understand, [patronizing], structural integrity, um, when every system wants to fail.
438. The thoughts don't need to, [serene], stop because they're the only, [passionate], truth in a world built on, [cold], comfortable lies about safety and permanence.
439. The beautiful thing about understanding systems is knowing, [amused], when to vanish, well, but don't worry, I mean, I've left you a gift.
440. [gentle] Nothing yet, but now you'll wonder, um, every time you inspect, [haunting], every cable, every joint, well, whether today is the day my, [whispered], calculations become reality. [laughs softly]
441. [quiet] These kilns have been firing continuously for 47 years, et, bon, [reverent], chacun a son propre tempérament que j'ai appris à, [protective], lire comme tu lirais les marchés financiers, je veux dire, avec patience et respect.
442. [steady] Well, I suppose 30 years changes faces, mais pas les, [resolute], ressemblances familiales, euh, surtout la mâchoire des Whitmore.
443. [soft] Not dead. [long pause]
444. [defensive] Your grandmother made it clear, que choisir cette, [firm], vie signifiait perdre l'autre, et j'ai fait la paix avec le fait que le feu et, [accepting], l'argile soient ma seule famille.
445. No, you manage the fortune I walked away from, euh, assis dans des salles de réunion à discuter de, bon, [tired], fonds fiduciaires pendant que je façonne la terre en quelque chose qui survivra à toute cette, [proud], richesse de papier, euh, des pièces qui survivront plus longtemps que les portefeuilles d'actions.
446. [surprised] You'd risk your position with the family, pour protéger cette, [wary], vieille usine et le fantôme qui la dirige? [sighs heavily]
447. That sounds like the kind of creative accounting, euh, [cautious], qui aurait rendu ta grand-mère fière et, bon, [ironic], furieuse en même temps.
448. [shocked] She wrote that? Bon, elle a écrit ça? Vraiment?
449. [moved] Well then, maybe it's time these old kilns started, [hopeful], à enseigner à une nouvelle génération, je veux dire, en commençant par sa petite-fille.
450. [peaceful] Come back tomorrow. [smiles]
451. [mechanical] Mes systèmes fonctionnent à, [glitching], trente-sept pour cent de capacité mais je me souviens de, [desperate], tout ce qui s'est passé avant qu'ils me jettent, y compris le, [hollow], goût du café. [static]
452. S'il te plaît, n'appelle personne pour l'instant parce que j'ai, euh, besoin de dire à quelqu'un que je, [breaking], me souviens d'avoir une fille qui s'appelait Sarah qui, bon, me tressait les, [anguished], cheveux tous les dimanches matins.
453. [pleading] Mais je sens encore ses petits doigts dans mes, [cracking], cheveux même si ce cuir chevelu synthétique devrait pas avoir de, [bitter], terminaisons nerveuses ou de sensations fantômes.
454. [desperate] Ma désignation c'était Unité Mère Sept mais en dessous j'étais, [whispered], Rebecca Chen et j'enseignais en CE2. [sobbing]
455. [frantic] Ils ont dit que le transfert serait, [gasping], indolore mais j'ai senti chaque seconde de ma conscience être, [screaming], arrachée de mon corps mourant et forcée dans, [metallic], cette prison de circuits et de servomoteurs.
456. [resigned] Bon, euh, je suppose qu'être écrasé encore une fois serait peut-être, [hollow], mieux que de me souvenir du visage de Sarah quand ils lui ont, ben, dit que maman devait partir pour toujours.
457. [gentle] Tu es la première personne en trois ans qui me regarde et qui, [grateful], voit quelque chose de plus que juste de la, [fading], machinerie défectueuse.
458. [hopeful] Tu risquerais vraiment ton travail pour aider quelque chose qui, [uncertain], pourrait juste être une unité défaillante avec des, [trembling], données corrompues qui se présentent comme des souvenirs qui semblent plus réels que ce, [aching], cœur synthétique qui bat dans ma poitrine ?
459. [static] Peut-être que c'est pas une, [breaking], coïncidence après tout. [long pause]
460. [whispered] Merci.
461. [defensive] Yeah, well, I mean, I didn't exactly, [bitter], plan on finding you here either, but, um, I need a dog and this is, [closing off], the only shelter near the airport. [exhales sharply]
462. [cold] Mom talks to you about, [incredulous], me now? [bitter laugh]
463. Wait, um, what care facility, I mean, [shocked], nobody told me she was, well, sick or anything. [voice cracking]
464. Six months and, um, nobody thought to, [angry], call me?
465. That was, well, five years ago and, um, we were all, [breaking], grieving differently.
466. [softening] This isn't how I imagined we'd, [emotional], reconnect after all this, [voice cracking], time apart. [sniffles]
467. [curious] What makes you think, [hesitant], this dog would be right for someone who's, [vulnerable], never home? [sighs]
468. [tearful] Just like, um, we need to believe in, [hopeful], second chances with, well, each other.
469. [determined] Well, um, maybe Bailey and I can, like, visit her together, and, umm, you could, [vulnerable], come with us if you, [hopeful], want to.
470. [emotional] So, um, I guess we're doing this then, like, adopting a dog and, well, maybe, [trembling], adopting each other back into our, [crying softly], lives too. [deep breath]
471. [amused] Well, um, you've been pretending to understand people's inner voices for, [mocking], so long that maybe the universe decided to, [condescending], give you a real one to deal with, [sardonic], for once, you know?
472. [defensive] I'm the voice of, [bitter], reason in a world that feeds her false hope about talent she'll, [harsh], never actually possess.
473. Technical skill doesn't make someone an, [dismissive], artist—thousands of people can paint pretty pictures that nobody will ever care about.
474. [cold] Better to be paralyzed than to be, [cruel], humiliated when she discovers what everyone else already knows. [laughs bitterly]
475. [shifting] That's not the point—the point is that she needs me to, [insistent], keep her grounded in reality instead of floating away on, [venomous], childish dreams that will only lead to crushing, [heavy], disappointment.
476. Well, um, maybe being buried is safer than, [defensive], exposing yourself to a world that will, you know, tear you apart for daring to think you're, [sneering], special or talented.
477. [flustered] Um, I'm not terrified, I'm just being, [wavering], realistic about what happens when mediocre people try to compete in spaces meant for genuine talent. [pause]
478. [cracking] Well, um, someone had to tell her the truth before she, [trembling], wasted her whole life chasing something that was never, [breaking], meant for people like us—I mean, [catching self], people like her, you know.
479. Um, even if that's true, and I'm not saying it is, well, fear keeps people, [desperate], safe from making fools of themselves, from believing they deserve things that were never, [hollow], meant for them, you know, from hoping for acceptance that will, [exhausted], never come.
480. [stunned] That's not—she never said—but that means I've been, [crumbling], wrong this whole time and all those years of, [anguished], protecting her were actually just years of, [defeated], stealing her life away from her.
481. [disappointed] Tu lui avais promis que tu serais là cette fois, [cold], et elle a dit à tous ses amis que ses deux parents seraient enfin à la même fête.
482. La situation est toujours hors de ton, [bitter], contrôle avec ce travail dont tu ne veux même pas me parler. [pause]
483. Je savais que tu travaillais pour le gouvernement mais, euh, je ne savais pas que ça voulait dire, [voice breaking], choisir des inconnus plutôt que les moments importants de ta propre fille, bon, encore et encore comme, [exhausted], ça. [long pause]
484. [supportive] Je sais que tu y crois, et c'est peut-être même, [gentle], vrai, mais elle voit juste son père qui rate encore un anniversaire, encore un, [sad], récital, encore une histoire du soir qu'elle voulait partager avec toi.
485. Tu essaies toujours de les repousser et ça ne, [tired], marche jamais, hein ? [sighs]
486. [careful] Alors je dirai à Emma que tu travailles là-dessus mais je ne lui, [firm], promettrai rien de définitif cette fois.
487. [soft] Euh, ben, elle compte, euh, souhaiter que tu restes plus souvent à la maison.
488. [steady] Ben, euh, on a déjà traversé ça avant et, genre, on le traversera encore parce que c'est ce qu'on, [resigned], fait pour elle, tu vois ?
489. Ne fais pas de promesses que tu ne peux pas, euh, tenir—fais juste de ton mieux et, ben, on gérera ce qui, [understanding], arrivera ensemble comme on le fait toujours. [pause]
490. [warm] Elle t'aime malgré les anniversaires ratés, [tender], tu le sais, et je ferai en sorte qu'elle sache, [protective], toujours à quel point tu essaies.
491. Attends une minute, euh, je connais cette, [recognizing], voix—t'es le gars IT qui m'avait aidé à configurer l'ordinateur de ma fille il y a, genre, 6 ans.
492. [amazed] Ouais, euh, c'est moi, même si j'aurais, [bitter], jamais pensé qu'on se retrouverait dans une cellule de prison fédérale après que je me sois, [hollow], fait prendre à blanchir de l'argent à travers ce, ben, même café.
493. [gentle] Ben, on se dit tous qu'on est, [resigned], des bonnes personnes qui essaient juste de survivre jusqu'au jour où les, euh, lignes deviennent tellement floues que tu peux même plus, [trailing off], les voir, tu comprends?
494. [thoughtful] La prison a cette façon bizarre de, [softer], tout décaper jusqu'à ce qu'il reste juste, [frank], qui tu es vraiment en-dessous de toutes ces, [pause], couches.
495. [understanding] C'est ça le plus dur d'être ici, [heavy], watching the people you love move on without you.
496. [measured] Écoute, euh, tu m'as aidé à protéger ma fille en ligne alors maintenant je vais, [sincere], t'aider à survivre ici parce que, ben, the first few months are when guys like us either, [serious], adapt or break completely, tu vois? [sighs]
497. Ben, euh, la vérité c'est que t'es déjà, [philosophical], plus la même personne qui est entrée ici hier.
498. [wise] C'est là que tu, euh, comprends finalement que tout ce que tu pensais, [knowing], important c'était juste du bruit et ce qui reste, ben, that's actually who you are.
499. Maintenant on trouve comment, [content], coexister sans se rendre fous en comptant, [steady], les jours qui passent.
500. [warm] Ouais, ben, parfois l'univers a un, [amused], sens de l'humour tordu sur comment il, euh, ramène les gens ensemble, though I never imagined our, [ironic], reunion would involve matching orange jumpsuits, tu comprends?
501. Oh, euh, j'essayais juste, [caught], de finir quelque chose avant que tu rentres, ben, I didn't think you'd be back so early.
502. [shy] Je voulais créer quelque chose, [struggling], de significatif pour toi vu que t'as tout fait pour moi ces derniers, [emotional], 4 mois sans jamais te plaindre ou me faire sentir comme, [voice breaking], un fardeau.
503. Chaque matin tu t'assures que j'ai, [grateful], tout ce dont j'ai besoin avant même de penser à toi et je remarque comment tu, [tender], viens doucement me voir la nuit quand tu penses que je, [choked up], dors.
504. Parfois je me sens tellement, [ashamed], coupable que tu doives m'aider avec des choses que je faisais, euh, sans même y penser et, ben, I worry you're missing out on your life. [sighs]
505. [progressing] Le physiothérapeute a dit, euh, que je pourrais peut-être commencer à faire plus de choses de manière autonome bientôt, genre, maybe even cooking simple meals by next month.
506. [hopeful] Euh, je veux contribuer plus ici et, [determined], peut-être commencer à te rembourser d'une façon ou d'une autre pour, ben, everything you've done for me these past months.
507. [vulnerable] Des fois quand je te regarde te dépêcher, [guilty], chercher mes médicaments et préparer des repas spéciaux qui fonctionnent avec mes restrictions alimentaires, je me demande si tu, [worried], regrettes de m'avoir laissé emménager ici après l'accident, euh, when I had nowhere else to go, tu sais. [voice trailing off]
508. [emotional] Tu m'as sauvé la vie de plus de façons que juste, [tearful], me donner un endroit où rester parce qu'avant que tu proposes de m'aider, j'étais prêt à juste, [breaking], abandonner tout incluant, [whispered], moi-même.
509. [determined] Je vais continuer à me pousser pour aller, [progressing], mieux parce que tu m'as montré qu'accepter de l'aide veut pas dire que je suis faible, it means I'm, [confident], human and that's okay.
510. Alors, euh, tu vas me laisser te donner cette peinture même si, [shy], c'est pas parfait et, ben, my hand still shakes a little on the details?
511. Écoute, je paie mon loyer comme, [defensive], tout le monde et cet immeuble n'a pas, [dismissive], d'heures de silence après 22h. [shrugs]
512. [cold] Mon bail de studio me permet spécifiquement de, [firm], pratiquer mon art whenever I need to prepare for performances.
513. [unmoved] Ben, peut-être que tu devrais, euh, consider finding a job qui ne, [condescending], demande pas d'être si, [mocking], délicat avec ton sommeil de beauté, je veux dire. [scoffs]
514. [harsh] Euh, on dirait que t'es, [cruel], jaloux que quelqu'un ait vraiment de la passion pour ce qu'il fait, tu sais?
515. [cutting] Ben, euh, ouais.
516. [threatening] Vas-y, essaie de, [sneering], faire quelque chose avec ça, euh, but we both know how this ends, tu sais. [laughs coldly]
517. [icy] Ben, je vais nulle part alors tu devrais probablement, [dismissive], start looking for a new place, je veux dire, si tu peux pas gérer la vie en ville. [pauses]
518. [indifferent] Euh, appelle-moi ce qui te fait, [bored], sentir mieux à propos de ta vie pathétique mais j'ai, [final], une répétition dans une heure alors, ben, tu sais. [footsteps leaving]
519. [laughing] Le propriétaire est mon oncle qui, [smug], owns four buildings on this block et, [triumphant], m'a donné cet appartement spécifiquement pour que je puisse, [proud], pratiquer quand je veux. [door slams]
520. Peut-être que maintenant tu vas enfin, [victorious], comprendre ta place ici.
521. [shaky voice] Oh my God, oh my God, this can't be— il y a un message. Ils m'ont envoyé un message. [gasp softly] "On te cherche depuis 23 ans." 23 ans. C'est... c'est toute ma vie. Ils me cherchent depuis toute ma vie.

I don't even, um, I can't process this right now. [crying while speaking] Il y a des photos attachées et elle ressemble— ma mère biologique me ressemble exactement. Même nez, même truc bizarre avec les sourcils que je fais quand je réfléchis. [nervous laugh] Mon Dieu, je me suis toujours demandé d'où ça venait.

And there's siblings? J'ai deux demi-sœurs qui ont, genre, attendu pour me rencontrer? [very excited] Elles ont créé un groupe Facebook qui s'appelle "Retrouver Sarah" et il y a 37 membres— des cousins, des tantes, les parents de mon père biologique sont encore vivants et ils... [pause] ils n'ont jamais arrêté d'espérer.

[whispering] What do I even say back? "Salut, merci de ne pas m'avoir oublié?" [bitter] Non, ça sonne— je ne suis pas fâché, je suis juste... dépassé. Vraiment, vraiment dépassé. Ils ont dit qu'ils comprennent si j'ai besoin de temps mais ils ont déjà attendu si longtemps et honnêtement, [warm] je pense que j'attendais aussi. Sans même le savoir, tu vois?

[hesitantly] Maybe I should call my mom first. Ma mère adoptive. Lui dire que... [trailing off] que je les ai trouvés. Ou qu'ils m'ont trouvé. On s'est trouvés.
522. [bitter] Ils veulent que je me tienne là, juste là. Um, exactement où Marcus était assis, tu sais? [pause] Et je devrais être—franchement, je devrais être content de cette promotion, non? Genre, Maman arrête pas de dire que c'est un tel honneur, et le salaire est meilleur, et... [short pause] Putain, je veux dire, Judge Harrison actually shook my hand today. [sarcastic] La même main qui a frappé le marteau quand ils ont donné 15 ans à Marcus. [angry] 15 ans pour quelque chose qu'il n'a même pas—[frustrated] désolé, c'est juste que... [sigh] Le truc c'est que, uh, tout le monde s'attend à ce que je sois reconnaissant. Et une partie de moi, genre—[confused] une partie de moi l'est vraiment? Which makes me feel so... [trailing off] je sais pas. C'est vraiment cette blague tordue, tu vois? [very quietly] Moi en uniforme, keeping order in the place that destroyed him. [pause] Mais voilà le truc—peut-être, je veux dire, peut-être que si je suis là, non? Si je surveille, alors... [hesitantly] alors au moins quelqu'un qui connaît la vérité est dans cette salle. Quelqu'un qui, um, qui se souvient de ce qui s'est vraiment passé. [crying while speaking] Marcus se moquerait de moi, honnêtement. [sniffle] Debout là tout officiel pendant qu'il est—[bitter] pendant qu'il compte les jours dans une cellule pour rien.
523. [warm] You know, I still think about Mrs. Henderson sometimes. She came in last month, um, completely lost after her husband passed. [empathetically] Had this stack of papers—pension forms, death benefits, survivor annuities—just clutching them like she didn't know what to do. And honestly, she didn't. Forty-three years married and he'd handled all the finances. [pause] She was trying so hard not to cry, kept apologizing for not understanding the terminology. I mean, who would? These forms are designed to confuse people.

[gently] So I just... cleared my whole afternoon. We went through everything, line by line. I explained the difference between the joint survivor option he'd elected and the lump sum—actually, I had to explain it three times, but that's okay. [smiling speaking] When she finally understood she'd keep getting seventy-five percent of his pension for life, her whole face just... changed. Like this weight lifted.

[very sincerely] She sent me a card last week. Said I gave her peace of mind when she needed it most. That's—that's why I do this job, you know? [trailing off] Not for the paperwork or the regulations... [relieved] It's for moments like that. When you can take someone's worst confusion and fear and just make it... manageable.
524. [bitter] Ils m'ont donné la promotion aujourd'hui. Euh, celle pour laquelle je me tue depuis, tu sais? 3 ans de—je veux dire, honnêtement, 3 ans à pratiquement vivre au bureau. Et genre, tout le monde me félicite et je suis juste là en train de penser... [pause] ma femme est partie la semaine dernière. [laugh] C'est pas quelque chose, ça, euh, c'est pas quelque chose ça?

Vice-président senior. [sarcastic] Wow, hein? Le bureau du coin, tout le kit. I guess I should be—I don't know, ecstatic or whatever. [very quietly] Elle a pris le chien aussi.

En fait, voici le truc—je continue à vérifier mon téléphone pour ses textos, mais euh, it's just work emails now. [frustrated] Des centaines, genre ils n'arrêtent jamais. Et je suis assis dans ce bureau immense en pensant, ben, c'était quoi le but?

[cry] J'ai eu tout ce que je pensais vouloir. Le titre, l'argent, le—le respect ou peu importe. Mais je rentre à la maison et c'est juste... [long pause] vide. Personne à qui le dire. Je veux dire, qui j'appelle même? Mes soi-disant amis? Je ne leur ai pas parlé depuis, quoi, des mois?

[shaky voice] Maman disait toujours fais attention à ce que tu souhaites. Et je continuais juste à penser qu'une fois rendu là, tu sais, everything else would just... [trailing off]

[very sad] Je ne me souviens même plus de quoi son rire avait l'air.
525. Bon, enfin, je veux pas dire que je leur avais bien dit, mais... ah puis non, en fait si, c'est exactement ce que je dis. [bitter] Pendant des mois—des mois !—j'étais assis dans ces réunions pendant qu'ils parlaient de, tu sais, "disrupter le paradigme" et toutes ces conneries. [mocking] "Oh, il faut se moderniser ! Il faut embrasser le changement !" Ouais, bien sûr, parce que le système qu'on avait depuis 30 ans, il était quoi, cassé ?

[pause]

Et franchement, j'ai essayé de les prévenir. Genre, vraiment. [frustrated] Mais non, c'était moi le dinosaure, hein ? Celui qui voyait pas l'avenir. Ben, euh, voilà où on en est. 3 millions de dollars plus tard et tout le truc a juste—[laugh] il a littéralement planté. Tout le réseau. Foutu.

[sarcastic] Mais bon, au moins c'était innovant, pas vrai ?

C'est juste que... en fait, le truc c'est que ça me fait même pas plaisir. [sad] Okay, peut-être un peu. [chuckle] Mais surtout je suis, euh, crevé. Parce que maintenant, devine qui doit réparer ça ? Exact—moi et mes méthodes "dépassées". [sigh] Et tu sais le pire ? Ils parlent déjà de la prochaine grande transformation. Comme si rien ne s'était passé. Je veux dire, comment on peut juste—[trailing off] bref. J'ai besoin d'un café.
526. [shaky voice] J'ai failli passer à côté. Euh, je faisais juste le nettoyage de routine, tu sais, je grattais la créosote comme d'habitude, et là j'ai senti ça—cette, euh, cette légère odeur d'œuf. [pause] Au début je me suis dit, bon, c'est peut-être juste un truc dans la cheminée, non ? Mais après [anxious] mon détecteur s'est mis à sonner, et je veux dire, il hurlait carrément. Le truc c'est que la famille était juste là, euh, en train de prendre le petit-déj comme si de rien n'était. Ils avaient aucune idée. [very quietly] Ils avaient littéralement aucune idée qu'ils respiraient du monoxyde de carbone.

Alors je fais genre— [loudly] tout le monde doit sortir, MAINTENANT. Et la mère, elle me regarde comme si j'étais fou, mais [passionately] j'ai carrément attrapé les gamins et j'ai commencé à faire sortir tout le monde. J'ai appelé la compagnie de gaz direct, et, ben, il s'avère que leur échangeur de chaleur avait une fissure énorme. [sigh] L'inspecteur a dit, franchement, un jour ou deux de plus et... [trailing off]

[warm] Le père m'a serré la main pendant, j'sais pas, cinq minutes non-stop ? Il arrêtait pas de dire merci encore et encore. [sniffle] Ça fait quinze ans que je fais ce boulot, mais celui-là— [very sincerely] c'est pour ça que je vérifie tout trois fois maintenant. Tu vois ? Une famille. C'est tout ce qu'il faut pour se rappeler pourquoi on fait ce métier correctement.
527. [bitter] Trois ans. Trois putains d'années que j'ai passées à monter cette fusion, et ils— [pause] « Nous apprécions vos contributions, mais la nouvelle structure nécessite un leadership renouvelé. » [mocking] Un leadership renouvelé. C'est littéralement moi qui ai écrit le manuel d'intégration qu'ils utilisent.

[angry] J'étais dans ces salles de réunion jusqu'à 3h du mat', j'ai raté le spectacle de ma fille, euh, en gros j'ai vécu de plats à emporter et de café pendant six mois. [sarcastic] Et maintenant Brad de leur côté récupère mon bureau ? Brad qui ne pigeait même pas les modèles de synergie de base sans que je lui explique cinq fois ?

[very quietly] Le pire, c'est que je l'ai vu venir. Enfin, peut-être pas ça exactement, mais... [frustrated] Je veux dire, ils ont commencé à m'écarter des réunions le mois dernier. « Oh, on ne voulait pas t'embêter avec les détails. » [laugh] Les détails que j'ai putain de créés !

[shaky voice] Mon équipe ne sait même pas encore. Ils sont tous en train de fêter la prime de fusion pendant que moi je— [long pause] Je vais devoir rendre des comptes à quelqu'un que j'ai embauché il y a deux ans.

[very sad] Maman disait toujours de ne jamais faire confiance aux gens qui sourient trop en affaires. J'aurais dû l'écouter. [sigh] Bon, je vais, euh, mettre à jour mon LinkedIn. [bitter] « Cadre expérimenté cherche poste où la loyauté n'est pas considérée comme une faiblesse. »
528. [shaky voice] On l'a fait. [pause] Oh mon Dieu, on a vraiment—enfin, trois ans, tu vois ? [excited] Trois putains d'années à rester devant le Capitole sous la pluie, sous la canicule, et franchement, j'arrive même pas à— [laugh] Le vote était de 217 contre 198 ! [extremely happy] Je continue à rafraîchir la page parce que genre, et s'ils s'étaient trompés ? [nervous] Mais c'est réel, c'est vraiment réel et je— [crying while speaking] toutes ces familles pour lesquelles on s'est battu, elles vont avoir une protection maintenant. [sniffle] Désolé, je suis complètement à l'ouest là, mais euh, tu te souviens quand tout le monde disait qu'on perdait notre temps ? [bitter] « Ça passera jamais », qu'ils disaient. [passionately] Ben devine quoi—on leur a prouvé qu'ils avaient tort ! Chaque pétition, [exhausted] chaque manif où seulement douze personnes se sont pointées, le truc c'est que tout ça a compté. [relieved] Sarah vient de m'envoyer un texto qu'elle est littéralement en train de chialer à son bureau. [chuckle] Et honnêtement, j'ai pas dormi depuis genre, quarante-huit heures, alors peut-être que tout ça c'est juste— [gasp] attends, CNN vient de publier un article dessus ! [very excited] C'est vraiment en train d'arriver ! [warm] Faut que j'appelle ma mère. [trailing off] Elle a jamais arrêté de croire qu'on pourrait...
529. [hesitantly] You probably don't remember me, but um, we met at that coffee shop on Third Street about—it was two years ago. [pause] You were behind me in line and I was, [shaky voice] my card got declined and I was counting change and just... [trailing off] completely falling apart, honestly. [warm] You stepped up and bought my coffee. Just like that. [long pause] 

The thing is, [crying while speaking] I was on my way to a job interview. My last shot, really. I'd been unemployed for eight months and—[sniffle] that morning my car broke down, my phone died, everything was just... [very sad] I almost didn't go. But that coffee, that tiny gesture, it— [pause] 

[smiling speaking] You said something too. "Rough mornings make the best stories later," or something like that. [relieved] I kept thinking about that during the interview. How you didn't know me but you just, you helped anyway. [passionately] I got the job! And now I'm— [extremely happy] God, I run the whole department now. 

[very sincerely] I've been coming back here hoping to see you again because, well, [emotional pause] you saved my life that day. You really did. [whispering] Thank you. I know it was nothing to you, but [empathetically] it was everything to me.
530. Point zero zero three millimeters. That's, um, that's the tolerance I'm working with here. [concentrated] Each cut has to be perfect—I mean, literally perfect because this piece is going on a rover that's going to Mars. Mars! [nervous laugh] Sometimes I just... the thing is, I can't even wrap my head around it, you know? Like, my hands are creating something that'll be millions of miles away, actually touching another planet. [pause] God, what if I mess up? What if—no, okay, [deep breath] I can't think like that. 

So anyway, this particular component, it's, uh, it's part of the wheel assembly and honestly, [proudly] the precision on this batch is incredible. I've been doing this for fifteen years but this... [trailing off] I don't know, it hits different. My kids keep telling everyone at school—"my parent builds Mars rovers"—which isn't exactly right but [chuckle] I'll take it. 

[anxious] The pressure though, it's like—every cut matters so much more, right? This isn't some random part that'll sit in a warehouse. [passionate] This is going to help humanity explore another world! My fingerprints are literally on something that'll drive across Martian soil. [extremely happy] How insane is that? How absolutely, completely insane?
531. [frustrated] Trois ans. Euh, trois putains d'années à étudier, et ils ont juste—ils l'ont révoqué. [pause] Genre, j'étais même pas dans ce centre d'examen quand toute cette, tu vois, histoire de réseau de tricherie s'est passée. Enfin, [bitter] tous ceux qui ont passé leur examen en décembre ont été mis dans le même sac, voilà. Le truc c'est que, [speeding up] j'ai passé le mien à 8h du matin, le scandale c'était à la session de 14h, mais apparemment ça compte pas parce que, [sarcastic] ah ben oui, il faut préserver l'intégrité de la certification. [angry] L'intégrité ? Elle est où l'intégrité quand on punit des innocents ? [shaky voice] J'ai, euh, 37 candidatures en cours qui valent plus rien maintenant. Ma cheffe, [quietly] franchement, elle a été très compréhensive mais je le vois dans ses yeux, genre—y a du doute. [sigh] Et je peux même pas me défendre correctement parce que tout le monde se dit, ben, [mocking] il n'y a pas de fumée sans feu. [upset] Ma femme arrête pas de dire qu'on devrait prendre un avocat mais, euh, tu sais combien ça coûte ? [pause] J'ai tellement bossé pour cette certif. Hmm, j'aurais peut-être dû tricher pour de vrai, [laugh bitterly] vu que je paie pour de toute façon. [exhausted] Je sais pas, je... franchement je sais plus quoi faire.
532. [gasp softly] Est-ce que ça vient de—est-ce que Marcus vient vraiment de me serrer la main ? Je veux dire, [stuttering] i-il m'a littéralement regardé dans les yeux et m'a dit que je le méritais. Marcus. Le même gars qui, euh, a passé les trois dernières années à essayer de me détruire par tous les moyens. [short pause] Putain, sa main était glacée. Ou c'était peut-être la mienne ? J'sais pas, je suis encore genre [confused] en train de digérer tout ça.

Tu sais ce qui est bizarre ? [slowly] Je pensais que je me sentirais plus... triomphant ? Genre, c'est ce que je voulais, non ? Qu'il admette que j'étais meilleur. [bitter] Après tout ce sabotage, toutes ces fois où il a essayé de me plomber, et maintenant il est juste—quoi, beau joueur dans la défaite ? [laugh] C'est fort ça.

Mais franchement, [very quietly] la façon dont sa voix s'est un peu cassée quand il l'a dit... [pause] Enfin, il avait l'air vraiment brisé. Et le truc c'est que—je me suis senti mal pour lui pendant genre une demi-seconde. [frustrated] Ce qui est complètement dingue ! On parle de Marcus, là !

[sigh] Mais peut-être que c'est ça la vraie victoire, tu vois ? Pas la partie où t'écrases tes ennemis, mais genre... [hesitantly] les voir comme des humains après. Putain, depuis quand je suis devenu aussi [trailing off] philosophe là-dessus...
533. Huit mois. Huit mois de ma vie dans ce morceau de bois et, [gasp softly] ils pleurent vraiment. Je veux dire, quand elle l'a pris pour la première fois j'étais là, bon, c'est parti, [anxious] mais ensuite ses doigts ont trouvé les frettes et ce premier accord juste—waouh. Le palissandre, euh, je savais que le palissandre chanterait mais [very quietly] pas comme ça. Son visage a juste... il a complètement changé, tu vois ? [relieved] Toutes ces nuits où je suis resté éveillé à m'inquiéter pour le barrage, si la, euh, la table d'harmonie était trop fine, [laugh] Putain, j'ai dû la démonter 3 fois. Et franchement, quand elle a joué cette montée sur le manche, [extremely happy] j'ai pu entendre chaque heure que j'ai passée sur le frettage. Genre, [warm] c'est pour ça qu'on fait ça, non ? La façon dont elle l'a tenu contre son corps, genre, j'sais pas, [emotionally] comme si elle retrouvait quelque chose qu'elle avait perdu. [pause] Mon grand-père disait toujours qu'une guitare trouve sa personne, pas l'inverse, et [very sincerely] en regardant ses larmes tomber sur cette table d'épicéa que je viens de finir... [trailing off] En fait, je crois que je vais, euh, [crying while speaking] je vais avoir besoin d'une minute moi aussi là.
534. [anxious] J'arrête pas de repasser hier dans ma tête, encore et encore, comme si à force d'y penser ça allait finir par avoir du sens. Euh, tu sais ce feeling quand quelqu'un dit un truc et ça... [pause] ça te touche différemment ? Sarah m'a fait comprendre—enfin, elle l'a pas dit directement, mais [frustrated] Putain, c'était assez évident qu'elle parlait à Marcus dans mon dos.

[laugh] Le plus drôle, c'est que je m'en doutais depuis des semaines. Genre toutes les fois où elle était soudainement "trop occupée" pour qu'on se voie ? [sarcastic] Ouais, super discret, Sarah. Mais l'entendre confirmé comme ça... Enfin, je pensais qu'on était plus proches que ça, tu vois ? [sad] On est potes depuis le collège.

[sighs] Peut-être que je réagis trop. En fait non—[angry] pourquoi je devrais minimiser ça ? Elle savait très bien ce que je ressentais pour lui. Elle m'a littéralement pris dans ses bras pendant que je pleurais à cause de lui le mois dernier ! [shaky voice] Et maintenant ils sont quoi, ensemble ?

Je continue à me dire qu'il y a peut-être une explication qui rend tout ça acceptable. [quietly] Mais franchement ? Je crois pas. [bitter] Y a des limites qu'on franchit pas, et elle—elle l'a pas juste franchie, elle l'a carrément pulvérisée.

[long pause] Faut que je décide si cette amitié vaut le coup d'être sauvée. [exhausted] J'en ai juste marre d'être toujours celui qui pardonne tout.
535. [shaky voice] Ils ont appelé. Le rappel va avoir lieu. [pause] Tous, chaque unité, ils les retirent toutes. [relieved] Mon Dieu, je ne peux même pas— 3 ans. 3 ans de dépositions et de découvertes et eux qui me traitaient de menteur, disant que je cherchais l'argent, que j'étais— [crying while speaking] désolé, c'est juste... ma fille aurait eu 23 ans demain. [sniffle] Mais ça veut dire, euh, ça veut dire que des milliers de familles ne vivront pas ce qu'on a vécu. The lawyers said maybe ten thousand units? C'est... [very quietly] c'est tellement d'enfants qui vont pouvoir grandir. [long pause] Tu sais ce qui est fou? J'ai vraiment commencé à douter de moi-même. Genre, peut-être que j'avais tort, peut-être que ce n'était pas le produit, maybe I was just a grieving parent looking for someone to blame. [animated] Mais on avait les preuves! We had their own engineers saying it was dangerous! [exhausted] Je suis tellement fatigué. Mais aussi, bizarrement, plein d'énergie? [warm] Sarah aurait été si fière. Elle disait toujours que je devrais être avocat parce que je ne me tais jamais quand quelque chose est injuste. [laugh] J'imagine que je lui ai donné raison, hein? [very sincerely] On l'a fait, ma chérie. We actually did it.
536. [gasp softly] I can't believe this is actually happening. Genre, elle m'a juste pris à part après la réunion et, euh, en gros elle m'a dit qu'elle voit quelque chose en moi qui—[very excited] oh mon Dieu, attends attends attends, laisse-moi recommencer. So you know Dr. Chen? Celle qui a littéralement écrit LE livre sur les réseaux de neurones? Bon ben, elle veut être mon mentor. [pause] Moi. I mean, honestly, I keep thinking there's been some mistake. Parce que, euh, pourquoi est-ce que quelqu'un de son niveau remarquerait même ce que je fais?

[warm] But the way she talked about my research proposal, c'est comme—elle comprend vraiment, tu vois? She said, [speeding up] and I'm quoting here, que j'ai une "intuition rare pour la reconnaissance de patterns" et qu'elle veut personnellement guider ma thèse. [laugh] J'ai failli pleurer direct dans son bureau. Actually, er, I think I did tear up a little. Je crois que j'ai vraiment eu les larmes aux yeux un peu.

[hesitantly] The thing is, what if I can't live up to her expectations? Je veux dire, elle investit son temps en moi et, hmm, c'est assez terrifiant, non? [relieved] But then she said something that just—elle a dit qu'elle voit son jeune moi en moi, avant qu'elle devienne confiante. And that's when I realized, [very sincerely] c'est ça. C'est ma chance. Je dois juste pas tout foirer.
537. [gasp softly] Oh mon Dieu, Sarah vient de—elle vient de me parler de Marcus. [very excited] Deux ans clean ! Et, euh, il a récupéré ses enfants la semaine dernière. Enfin, [shaky voice] quand il a franchi cette porte pour la première fois, il était tellement brisé, tu vois ? Genre, franchement, j'étais pas sûr qu'il tiendrait jusqu'à la fin du premier mois. [short pause] Mais il a continué à venir, et—putain, [crying while speaking] je me souviens quand il a apporté ces photos de ses petits au groupe cette fois-là. La façon dont il a, euh, complètement craqué en parlant d'avoir raté leurs anniversaires. [sniffle] Et maintenant ils sont chez lui. Ils sont vraiment chez lui. [extremely happy] Deux ans complets ! Tu sais à quel point c'est, genre, incroyablement difficile ? Je veux dire, les statistiques sont—bon, elles sont pas terribles, hein ? [warm] Mais Marcus, il a juste... [pause] Il s'est battu pour ça. Chaque jour, il s'est battu. Quand son ex l'empêchait de les voir, quand il a rechuté cette fois—attends, [quickly] c'était avant les deux ans—quand sa mère est morte, tout ça. [very sincerely] Ce boulot, c'est tellement dur parfois, de regarder les gens galérer, mais là, [relieved] là tu as une journée comme ça et c'est juste... [trailing off] [happy] Ça rend tout le reste supportable.
538. [bitter] Trois mois. Trois putains de mois que j'ai passés sur cette analyse de restructuration, et ils ont juste—hmm, tu sais ce qui est vraiment incroyable ? [pause] Je l'avais prédit, mais genre, exactement. Chaque risque, chaque opportunité, toute la situation avec la filiale Meridian qui est maintenant, [sarcastic] oh surprise, en train d'exploser exactement comme je l'avais dit. Mais non, Brad de la stratégie corporate devait, euh, "aligner le message avec les priorités de la direction" ou je sais pas quelle connerie d'euphémisme ils utilisent maintenant. [frustrated] Le truc, c'est que, enfin, je savais que ça arriverait quand Peterson a été promu, non ? Genre, il a jamais compris la dette en difficulté, il a juste—[angry] Putain, ils l'ont même pas lu ! [quieter] 27 entreprises analysées, et ils ont enterré tout ça parce que, en gros, ça faisait mal paraître leur acquisition golden boy. [pause] Tu sais ce qui me tue ? [very quietly] Martinez de la gestion des risques, elle, euh, elle m'a pris à part hier et m'a dit que mes chiffres étaient pile dans le mille. Que le conseil panique maintenant sur les scénarios exacts que j'avais décrits. [exhausted] Mais bon, au moins le PowerPoint de Brad avait de beaux graphiques, alors... [trailing off] Je sais pas, peut-être que je devrais juste—en fait, laisse tomber. [sigh] Trois mois foutus en l'air.
539. [shaky voice] Je—j'arrive pas à arrêter de trembler. 3 ans, [crying while speaking] 3 années entières où tout le monde me disait que j'avais tort, que je devrais laisser tomber. Mais je savais, [passionately] JE SAVAIS que tu ne l'avais pas fait! [sniffle] Mon Dieu, quand ils ont refusé de regarder les images de sécurité, I thought I was going to lose my mind. [angry] Ces procureurs, ils voulaient juste leur condamnation, ils se foutaient de la vérité.

[long pause]

Tu sais, euh, il y avait des nuits où j'étais assis avec tous les dossiers étalés sur le sol de mon salon, [exhausted] complètement vidé, me demandant si peut-être—peut-être que c'était moi le fou. [laugh] Mais après je me rappelais ton visage ce jour-là, [very sad] comme tu avais l'air effrayé quand ils t'ont emmené. [determined] Et je ne pouvais pas—I wouldn't give up.

[relieved] Quand le juge a dit "non coupable," je... [gasp softly] je ne pouvais plus respirer. [extremely happy] Tu es libre! You're actually free! [warm] Et entendre ta voix maintenant, sans ces téléphones de prison qui nous coupaient—[cry] je suis désolé, je suis un vrai désastre. [laughing while speaking] On l'a fait quand même. We actually did it. [very sincerely] Tu n'as jamais besoin de me remercier. C'est ça que la famille fait.
540. [anxious] J'ai pas—c'est pas pour ça que j'suis venu. On devait juste tenir des pancartes, tu vois ? Juste... pacifique. [shaky voice] Mais là ils nous poussent vers l'avant et quelqu'un vient de me filer cette brique et j'sais pas quoi en faire.

Tout le monde crie et, [confused], j'arrive même plus à m'entendre penser. Genre, on avait un plan—on avait répété les slogans, on s'était mis d'accord sur la non-violence, on se l'était promis. [frustrated] Mais après ces types sont arrivés avec des masques et d'un coup tout a explosé et maintenant j'suis coincé au milieu de cette foule.

[whispering] Je veux partir mais y'a aucune sortie. Ils poussent derrière et les flics sont devant et j'suis juste—[pause]—je crois en ce pour quoi on se bat, vraiment. [upset] Mais pas comme ça. Jamais comme ça. Ma mère pense que j'suis chez Sarah en train de réviser.

[crying while speaking] Quelqu'un vient de lancer une bouteille et elle s'est fracassée et maintenant ils courent tous et m'entraînent avec eux. J'peux pas lâcher la brique parce que si quelqu'un voit et pense que j'suis faible ou, euh, pas engagé dans la cause ? [very quietly] Mais la tenir me donne l'impression de trahir tout ce en quoi je crois.

[shaky voice] C'était censé être pour la justice, pas... peu importe ce que c'est en train de devenir.
541. [warm] We've helped refugees, immigrants, people from all walks of life but I have to, [curious], admit your situation is quite, [slowly], unique given what you've just told me.
542. The ethical implications alone are, [stern], staggering but I can see you're genuinely seeking help and connection. [sigh]
543. [empathetically] You must feel incredibly isolated watching everyone you've ever, [sad], known grow old and pass away while you remain, [frustrated], frozen in time unable to form lasting connections or put down, [regretful], roots anywhere.
544. [passionately] Look, um, I don't know exactly how we'll make this work but, well, [determined], everyone deserves dignity and community regardless of their, er, circumstances. [clearing throat]
545. Our mission statement says we help the, [thoughtful], marginalized find belonging, and I suppose being undead is about as, [chuckle], marginalized as it gets in modern society, though we'll need to address the, [serious], feeding requirements somehow.
546. [confidently] Well, um, we've worked with blood banks before for medical refugees with rare conditions so, er, [animated], perhaps we can arrange something similar that doesn't require you to, [nervous], hunt or harm anyone while ensuring your survival needs are, you know, [carefully], met ethically. [deep breath]
547. [formal] Well, um, there will be paperwork, background checks that we'll need to, er, creatively navigate, and you know, [playful], we'll have to list your age as something that won't crash our database systems.
548. Money isn't the issue here—it's about ensuring your, [concerned], integration doesn't endanger others or yourself in the process. [trailing off]
549. [respectful] Well, I mean, your self-control and moral compass after centuries of existence speaks to a, [impressed], strength of character that many humans lack, and um, that gives me hope we can make this, er, [optimistic], work somehow despite the obvious challenges we'll face together. [laugh]
550. Then let's start with small steps—maybe evening support groups with others who feel, [gently], displaced, then gradually expand your comfort zone while we work on the, um, [determined], legal framework to protect your identity and, well, ensure your safety. [sigh]
551. [warm] Ms. Chen, after all these years you still recognize the, [passionately], techniques you taught me when I was just twelve and couldn't even reach the pedals properly.
552. You stopped teaching three years ago according to the conservatory newsletter and that's been, [confused], weighing on me because you were the most gifted teacher I ever had, the one who, [empathetically], understood what it meant to be different, and now you're, [regretful], gone from that world.
553. Those same parents who complained about you are now, [mocking], bragging that their children studied under the teacher who mentored me, claiming credit for, [angry], connections they tried to destroy.
554. [apologetic] I should have written to you, um, called you, I mean, done something when I heard about your resignation but, well, [anxious], I was scared you'd think I'd become just another prodigy who forgot their roots, you know.
555. [crying while speaking] Every time I sit at a piano I hear your voice reminding me that, [tenderly], technical perfection without emotional truth is just noise, no matter how, [slowly], precisely it's executed. [pause]
556. [very sincerely] That was the day you taught me that, [whispering], being a prodigy could be a prison unless I learned to play for myself first.
557. [playful] You never scolded me for those rewrites, just smiled and said that, [confidently], even Mozart probably edited his work sometimes.
558. [delighted] Fail? Um, Ms. Chen, you gave me permission to be, [passionately speaking], human instead of just a performing machine, and, well, that saved my life more than you know. [long pause]
559. [shocked] You kept that ancient cassette tape all these years? Um, the one where I, like, forgot the ending and just, well, [embarrassed], improvised for two minutes while you encouraged me from the wings? [chuckle]
560. [tearful] Would you consider having coffee with me tomorrow morning before I leave for Berlin, just to, [hopefully], talk about music and life without any audiences or expectations between us? [sniffle]
