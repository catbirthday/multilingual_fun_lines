=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So um, I think there's—no wait, it's my tips. They're, uh, kind of wrong? Maybe?

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear you're having issues with your tips! Let me pull up your account here—can you give me your employee ID number so I can see what's going on?

Customer [en]: It's, um, probably... 4-5-2... er, no that's—sorry, 4-2-5-8-9.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, thank you so much! So I've got employee ID 42589 here, and I can see you're at location ST-1147-B downtown, and um, I'm looking at your most recent paycheck from... let me just... okay, December 15th, is that the one we're talking about?

Customer [en]: Yeah. Of course it's short. I mean, uh, I sort of expected this.

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: Um, we pool tips, right? But it's, er, I think thirty percent less? Maybe more?

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, um, that's definitely concerning—so let me, uh, pull up the tip distribution report for that pay period, reference number PAY-121524-TIP, and, hmm, I can see here that your location reported $2,847 in pooled tips divided among twelve partners...

Customer [en]: Twelve? No. We had, um, eight. Well—Tuesday was eight. Wednesday too, I think.

Customer Support [en]: Oh that's—hmm, that could definitely be the issue then! So the system's showing twelve active partners in the pool for that period, but you're saying it was actually eight people working those shifts?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, sort of. Some quit. Or, uh, they were—I mean they weren't there.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: So like, um, can you just, er, fix it? Probably not though, right?

Customer Support [en]: I completely understand your frustration, and honestly, um, I've seen this happen before with the system not updating when people leave—so what I can do is, uh, submit a payroll correction request, that's form PCR-9847, and it usually takes about... well, three to five business days to process.

Customer [en]: Three to five. Great. Rent's tomorrow, so... yeah.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, I really, really feel for you on this—I mean, the timing couldn't be worse, and I wish I could just... but let me see if there's anything else we can do here, okay?

Customer [en]: Um, I guess, maybe? I mean, er, you probably can't actually help.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, what I'm gonna do—and this isn't a perfect solution but—I can flag this as urgent with code URG-HARDSHIP-12, and uh, that sometimes gets it looked at within 24 hours, and then also, hmm, have you registered for our emergency advance program?

Customer [en]: Wait, there's a... what? No one, um, told me about—is that real?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! Yeah, so it's program code EAP-2024, and basically if you have a documented payroll discrepancy like this—which you do, I'm creating ticket TKT-458892 right now—you can get up to 70% of the disputed amount advanced while we sort everything out.
