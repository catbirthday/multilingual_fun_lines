=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi. So I'm calling. About charges? Uh, streaming ones. Don't recognize them.

Customer Support [en]: Hi there! So, um, I'd be happy to help you with those streaming charges today, and basically what I can do is, uh, pull up your account here and we'll figure out exactly what's going on, okay?

Customer [en]: Oh. Good. Wait—really? That's... that's great actually.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! So let me just, um, get your account information here. Can you give me the, uh, the phone number or email associated with your account so I can, like, pull up those charges?

Customer [en]: It's, um. Let me—no wait. Actually—uh, 555-0342.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, got it! So I'm seeing here your account number is ACC-7829-MX and, um, basically there are three streaming services showing up. Let me just... okay so there's one for $14.99, another for $8.99, and, uh, a third one that's $19.99.

Customer [en]: Three? Um. I just... I can't. That's so many. Uh.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, I know, it can definitely be, like, overwhelming when they all add up! So, um, looking at the details here with reference code REF-394827-B, the first one is StreamPlus, the second is, uh, MovieBox Classic, and the third one is... hmm, okay so this one's interesting.

Customer [en]: Wait, really? What's. Um. What's interesting about it?

Customer Support [en]: So basically the third charge with transaction ID TXN-885743-QV is, um, it's actually a duplicate! Like, you're being charged twice for the same service, which is, uh, yeah, I know, it's ridiculous that this happens but I can definitely fix this for you right now.

Customer [en]: Oh! Um, you can? Just like. Fix it? Right now? Er.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! So what I'm gonna do is, um, process a refund for those duplicate charges. Your refund number will be RFD-229847-K and, uh, you should see that credit within 3-5 business days. Plus, like, I'm adding a service credit too.

Customer [en]: I'm—wait, really? That's. Um. That's wonderful! Uh, didn't expect. This.

Customer Support [en]: Of course! And so, um, honestly? Between you and me, this happens more than it should. The system sometimes just, like, creates these duplicate subscriptions and, uh, it's really annoying. But your new monthly total will just be $23.98 instead of $43.97.

Customer [en]: Oh my. Um. Half? It's half? Er, that's just—wow.

Customer Support [en]: Right? So I've also added a note to your file, um, case number CSE-449281-T, just to make sure this doesn't happen again. And, uh, basically if you see any weird charges next month, you just reference that case number.

Customer [en]: So helpful. Really. Um, I thought—no wait—I mean, uh. Thought this'd be hard.

Customer Support [en]: Aw, I'm so glad I could help! So is there, um, anything else with those streaming services? Like, do you actually use MovieBox Classic? Because, uh, looking at your usage data here, profile ID USR-338492-P shows you haven't logged in for three months.

Customer [en]: Um. No? I just... I don't even. Er. Remember that one. Should I—?

Customer Support [en]: So yeah, honestly, if you're not using it, let's just, um, cancel that one too! I'll process that right now with cancellation code CAN-774930-J and, uh, that'll save you another $8.99 a month. There we go, all set!
