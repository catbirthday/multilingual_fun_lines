Scenario: food truck driver, panicked about health permit renewal fees posted twice to his account

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, so I'm... uh, I'm calling about my account, there's um, there's something really wrong here.

Customer Support [en]: I think I can, um, probably help with that. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Could you maybe give me your account number or, um, the phone number associated?

Customer [en]: It's uh, 555-0147. Listen, I run a food truck and um, the health permit fees just... they hit twice and I really can't...

Customer Support [en]: Got it, so I'm, uh, looking at account FTR-9982-L here, and um, I think I see what you're talking about. There's, uh, two charges for $475 each posted today?

Customer [en]: YES! Exactly! Um, that's... that's my whole weekend profit gone and I mean, uh, I probably did something wrong when I was paying online but...

Customer Support [en]: Okay so I think what happened here—and this is, um, sort of common—the system probably had a little hiccup. Transaction ID TXN-4412-BK shows pending and then it, uh, posted twice.

Customer [en]: Can you just... I mean, um, can we fix this quickly? Because uh, I need that money back before Monday or I can't, um, buy supplies for next week.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, so um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, I think submit a reversal request. It's form REV-2024-K7, and um, normally it takes maybe 3-5 business days but let me see if I can, uh, expedite this.

Customer [en]: Three to five... no no no, um, that's not... I mean, uh, Monday is when my vendor needs payment.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. Okay. Let me check something else here.

Customer [en]: I'm probably being difficult, I just... this is really bad timing and if it was my fault somehow...

Customer Support [en]: No no, you're not being, um, difficult at all. So I'm, uh, looking at expedite option EXP-771, and I think, um, maybe we can get this reversed by end of business Monday?

Customer [en]: End of Monday is still...

Customer Support [en]: Actually wait. I see you've been a customer since 2019. Let me check if you qualify for our instant reversal under policy POL-88-INSTANT.

Customer [en]: Um, instant? That's... uh, that would actually save me here, is that really possible?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I'm checking the criteria and, uh, you definitely qualify. Account history is, um, perfect, and I think since it's clearly a duplicate charge, I can probably just... yeah, initiating now.

Customer [en]: Oh thank god, I was about to... wait, so it's going through right now?

Customer Support [en]: Yep. Reference number is RFD-2024-5837-A. Should hit your account within 2-4 hours. I'd say probably check around 3pm.

Customer [en]: This is... um, I mean thank you, really. I was panicking about having to cancel Saturday's festival and...

Customer Support [en]: Happy to help. Just keep that reference number RFD-2024-5837-A handy. And, um, maybe screenshot your confirmation page next time—sometimes the system times out but still processes.
