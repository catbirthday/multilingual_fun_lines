Scenario: airport shuttle driver, frustrated about incorrect toll charges appearing on his account

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so I'm just... hmm, let me see here... I keep getting, uh, toll charges that aren't mine.

Customer Support [en]: I understand. That's frustrating. Let me... I need to pull up your account first... what's the account number?

Customer [en]: It's... eight seven two... three nine four.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, account 872-394, and I'm seeing... hmm... there's actually, uh, quite a few toll charges here, let me just... okay so that's interesting...

Customer [en]: Yeah, um, I drive the airport shuttle so, uh, I mean, there's tolls but these, um, these aren't right.

Customer Support [en]: Right. Right. So looking at... um, what's the word... your transaction history TRN-9823-AL, there's, uh, seventeen toll charges just this week and... hmm, some of these routes don't even...

Customer [en]: Exactly. I don't even go those routes.

Customer Support [en]: Unfortunately I can only... um, I mean, the system shows... let me see here... these are coded as EZP-7741 transactions which, uh, limits what I can... hmm...

Customer [en]: So, um, what... I mean, uh, can you just, like, remove them or...?

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: I'm just tired of calling about this.

Customer Support [en]: I wish I could just... um, you know, clear them all but... wait. Wait wait. Let me, uh, check something... your vehicle tag VHL-8823-K is... hmm...

Customer [en]: Um, sorry, I'm just, uh, really exhausted dealing with... I mean, uh, every month it's the same thing.

Customer Support [en]: No no, I totally understand, and looking at case history CSE-4419-B through CSE-4427-B, you've called nine times about this.

Customer [en]: Nine times. Yeah. That sounds right.

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Oh okay so, um, I think I see... uh, there's a duplicate tag! Someone's, um, using tag number VHL-8823-K but it's, uh, linked to two accounts and...

Customer [en]: Wait, um, so someone else is... uh, I mean, hmm, that would explain why I keep getting their tolls?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly! So, um, here's what I can do... let me just... okay so I'm creating override OVR-2947-X which, uh, basically flags all these charges for reversal and, um, permanently blocks that duplicate...

Customer [en]: Oh. Okay. Sorry I was... kind of short earlier.

Customer Support [en]: No need to apologize! This has been going on way too long. Your credit for $247.83 will post within 24 hours under reference CRD-8829-V. Problem. Solved.
