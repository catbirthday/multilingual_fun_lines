=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So. Your hold music. It's—let me just—it's woken my baby. Three times.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, oh no, I'm—I'm really sorry about that, um, that's that's definitely not what we want happening, let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick, can I—can I get your account number?

Customer [en]: It's, um, basically 447-281. So like, each time I call? Twenty minutes. Baby screaming.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, okay so, um, account 447-281, I've got you here and, uh, I can see you've called—oh wow—three times today already, that's, um, that must be really frustrating with with the baby situation.

Customer [en]: Frustrating. Yes. That's—that's one word for it.

Customer Support [en]: So let me—no wait—actually, um, I'm gonna put a note here, reference code REF-9982-BK, that basically flags your account for, uh, for priority callback service, which means no more hold music at all.

Customer [en]: Um, so basically, like, why wasn't this done the first time? Or—or the second?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah that's, that's totally fair, um, I'm looking at the notes here from your previous calls, ticket numbers TKT-4419 and TKT-4420, and it looks like they—they didn't, uh, didn't actually complete the process, which is, um, honestly on us.

Customer [en]: Look. I just—my kid needs sleep. I need sleep. So like, can we just fix this?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely absolutely, so, um, what I'm doing right now is, uh, is setting up your account—let me just—okay so confirmation number CNF-7734-XP—this ensures you'll never hit our hold queue again, you'll go straight through.

Customer [en]: Um, and this—so this actually works? Not like, basically another promise?

Customer Support [en]: I get it, I really do, um, so here's what's different—I'm, I'm putting through an override code OVR-2981-MK that, uh, that literally bypasses our entire phone system, it's it's something we usually only do for, um, for special circumstances.

Customer [en]: Special circumstances. Like—wait, so basically three wake-ups isn't... never mind.

Customer Support [en]: No no, you're right, this this should've been done earlier, um, I'm also seeing here in your account that, uh, we can apply a service credit, code CRD-5567-TN, for for all the inconvenience today.

Customer [en]: I don't want credits. I want—I just need this to work. Please.

Customer Support [en]: Of course, yeah, so um, the bypass is is active now, effective immediately, and, uh, I've also added priority status PST-8823 to your account which means, um, any future issues get escalated straight to to senior support, no waiting.

Customer [en]: Um, so like, if I call back tomorrow? No music? Promise?

Customer Support [en]: Promise, and and actually, um, here's my direct extension, 4782, bypasses everything, goes straight to to this department, I've also, uh, sent you an email with confirmation number EML-9901-QR with all these details.

Customer [en]: Okay. That's—fine. So basically we're done? I can—I need to go, she's stirring.

Customer Support [en]: Yes yes, all set, um, everything's saved under case number CSE-6672-LP, and uh, again, really sorry about about the wake-ups, that's, that's rough with little ones.
