=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi. I got my bill? And it's... hmm, let me see here... three times what it usually is. That can't be right.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, um, I understand that's really concerning. Let me, uh, pull up your account here—what's your account number?

Customer [en]: It's, uh... 4-4-7... wait no, sorry. I mean 4-7-7... 2-8-9.

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it. Account ACC-477-289-B, um, and I'm seeing your latest statement here for, uh, $487.23 which is—yeah that's definitely higher than your average.

Customer [en]: Right. Exactly. So like... what if... hmm. Could the meter be broken?

Customer Support [en]: That's that's a good question. Um, let me check your usage patterns in system code UTL-9847-M here, and uh, I can see there was a spike starting around the 15th.

Customer [en]: The fifteenth. Okay. That's when—no wait. That's nothing special. Just me and my kid.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. Um, so here's what we're gonna do—I'm putting in a meter inspection request, reference MET-3982-QV, no charge to you.

Customer [en]: That's what the last person said. About the deposit. Then they charged me anyway.

Customer Support [en]: No no no, um, I hear you. This is different. I'm actually, uh, coding it as priority concern PRI-7763-X which means it it bypasses billing.

Customer [en]: Okay so... hmm, let me think here... when would someone come out?

Customer Support [en]: Um, with priority status? Within 48 hours. And and while we're waiting, uh, I can also apply a payment extension, code EXT-5529-R, gives you 30 extra days.

Customer [en]: Thirty days. Pause. That might work. Maybe. What's the... what's the word... the catch?

Customer Support [en]: There's there's honestly no catch. Um, I'm also seeing you qualify for our, uh, hardship program under code HRD-2246-K—that could reduce your bill by 25%.

Customer [en]: Ummm, wait. Really? So like, um, you're actually... you know... trying to help here?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely absolutely. Look, um, I see single household, one dependent, and uh, these spikes happen—faulty appliance, wiring issue—we're gonna figure this out.

Customer [en]: It's just. Hard. When things actually work out. Sorry, I mean—Tuesday, wait no, Thursday someone can come?

Customer Support [en]: Thursday latest. Um, I'm putting notes in ticket TKT-8891-Z that you need morning appointment, uh, because of school drop-off, that work?

Customer [en]: Yeah. Yes. That's... hmm, okay so that means... I can actually breathe a little?

Customer Support [en]: You can breathe. Um, your confirmation is CNF-4455-MP, and uh, I promise—we're we're gonna get this sorted. No one should pay triple. That's that's not right.
