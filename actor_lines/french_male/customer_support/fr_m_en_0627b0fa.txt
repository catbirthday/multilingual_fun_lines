Scenario: DJ, confused about equipment financing charges that don't match his original contract

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: *exhale* So basically I'm—I'm a DJ and like these charges are wrong, it's not—wait, sorry—not matching what I signed.

Customer Support [en]: Oh okay, let me pull up your account here... hmm, I see you have equipment financing. What's the, uh... what's the word... the discrepancy you're seeing between your contract and the charges?

Customer [en]: *sharp inhale* Supposed to be ninety-nine a month. They're charging—no wait—billing me one-sixty-eight. Can't do gigs if my gear gets repo'd.

Customer Support [en]: Alright, I definitely understand the concern. So your account number is FIN-4923-DJ and I'm showing, er, let me check the original terms here... yeah, the contract from March 15th does say $99 monthly. Hmm, that's strange.

Customer [en]: *exhale* Look I've got three weddings booked. Saturday, next Saturday, then—sorry—the weekend after. Need this fixed. Fast.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, we're going to get this sorted out right now. What I'm seeing is... uh, how do I explain this... looks like someone added insurance on April 2nd for $69 which brought your total to $168. Did you maybe authorize that addition?

Customer [en]: Insurance? No. Never. Didn't ask for—I mean like basically they just added it? Without telling me?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah that's, um, that's definitely not right. Let me dig into this a bit more... okay so I can see the insurance was added by our system automatically, which shouldn't have happened. I'm going to remove that right now and, er, also credit back the overcharges from the past 4 months.

Customer [en]: *exhale* Oh thank God. So like what's—what's my actual balance then? After you fix it?

Customer Support [en]: So once I process this—which I'm doing right now actually—your balance will drop from $672 to... let's see... $396 total, and going forward you'll only pay the $99 monthly as originally agreed. The credit of $276 should post within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: Okay. Good. But like—*sharp inhale*—next time this happens I'm switching companies. Lost two gigs already from credit holds.

Customer Support [en]: I completely understand your frustration, and honestly that should never have happened. What I'm also going to do is, uh... what's the best way... I'm adding a note to your account that locks your rate at $99 and prevents any automatic additions. Nobody can change it without your verbal confirmation.

Customer [en]: And my credit? The holds? That's Tuesday—no wait—Thursday they froze my card. At a venue. In front of clients.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, that must have been embarrassing. Let me check with our credit department... hmm, okay so I can see the holds from Thursday at 3:47 PM. I'm issuing an immediate release on those, and, er, I'm also sending a letter to the credit bureaus showing this was our error, not yours.

Customer [en]: *exhale* Fine. Good. So basically everything's fixed? The ninety-nine stays ninety-nine?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly, yes. Your rate is locked at $99 monthly through your contract end date of March 2025. I've documented everything in case number CS-7721-RES, and actually, I'm going to email you a confirmation right now with all these adjustments detailed.

Customer [en]: Email's good. Yeah. And like—sorry—one more thing. October payment. Already paid the one-sixty-eight.

Customer Support [en]: Ah right, good catch. So October's payment of $168... since it should have been $99, you'll have a $69 credit on your account. What I can do is either, umm... either apply that to November's payment or refund it directly to your card within 3-5 business days.

Customer [en]: Credit's fine. Just—just keep it simple. No more surprises.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely understood. Your November invoice will show $30 due after the $69 credit is applied. Everything's documented, your rate is locked, and honestly if you have any other issues at all, please call back and reference case CS-7721-RES. We've got your back on this.
