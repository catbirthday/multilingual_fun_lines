Customer: Um, hi there! So I'm calling about this, uh, expense report that got—well, it came back denied and I just thought maybe we could...
1. Okay okay, let me, um, pull that up. Need your, uh, employee ID first.
Customer: Oh sure, it's, um, let me see here... E-4-7-2-9. Sorry, I mean E-4-7-3-9!
2. Got it. E-4739. Um, looking here... expense report EXP-2024-1182, submitted, uh, last Tuesday. Give me just... okay okay, seeing the denial code.
Customer: Yeah, so like, I know you're probably busy but, um, it was just for team snacks after the tournament and I thought that was—
3. Right right, so, um, the code here is, uh, NC-447 which is... hmm... "non-covered athletic expense." System's showing, um, snacks aren't in the approved category under, uh, policy ATH-9921-B.
Customer: Oh. Well that's... I mean other coaches have definitely gotten snacks reimbursed before, so I just assumed...
4. Um, yeah, I'm, uh, really sorry about this. Let me just... diving deeper here... transaction TXN-88142-QV shows $47.82 at, um, Price Mart?
Customer: Right, exactly! And like, these kids just played their hearts out for three hours, you know? I mean, we can't just send them home hungry after all that...
5. I'm, uh, I'm checking the guidelines and, um, it's it's pretty strict on this. Really sorry. The, uh, the policy revision from January made it, um, more restrictive.
Customer: Okay but wait, sorry, can we just—I mean, Head Coach Martinez literally told me to buy the snacks. Like, explicitly said "go get snacks for the kids"...
6. Oh. Oh that's, um, different then. Let me, uh, add a note here. If you have, um, authorization from—wait, Martinez, that's that's department head level, right?
Customer: Um, yeah! Exactly! So like, I'm not trying to be difficult here but I basically got thrown under the bus for following instructions, which seems...
7. No no, you're, uh, you're absolutely right. I'm um, really sorry about this. Let me, uh, flag this for review with code SUP-AUTH-01. That that changes things.
Customer: Oh good! Because honestly? I was about to just—I mean, forty-seven bucks isn't gonna break me but it's the principle of it, right?
8. Totally totally get it. Um, so I'm, uh, escalating to claims review with reference REF-6639-MZ. They'll, um, they'll need Coach Martinez to, uh, confirm the authorization but then it should should process.
Customer: Perfect! See, I knew there had to be some way to... And hey, thanks for actually listening, you know? Some people just shut you down immediately.
9. Of course, um, happy to help. The the review takes, uh, usually 3-5 days and you'll get, um, an email to case number CSE-10847-RT when it's, uh, when it's resolved.
Customer: That's great, really appreciate it. Oh and um, just curious—going forward, is there like a different code I should use for team snacks or...?
10. Yeah so, um, for future, use, uh, category code CAT-18 "team morale" instead of CAT-22 "equipment." That that should, um, prevent this. Added a note to your profile, EMP-4739-NOTE.
Customer: Um, so... let me see here... I've called four times and, uh, nobody's actually... hmm, nobody gets what I'm saying.
11. I hear you—I hear you completely, and um, I'm pulling up your account right now with reference number REF-9942-TK, so let's—let's start fresh here and I promise I'm listening to every word you're telling me.
Customer: Wait. You're... you're actually looking? At my actual case?
12. Absolutely, yes, I've got case number CSE-4481-MN right here on my screen and I can see the previous interactions you've had, which, um, honestly don't look like they addressed your core issue at all.
Customer: Oh my God. Yes. That's... hmm, that's exactly it. Nobody sees it.
13. So the—no wait, let me just—okay okay, the thing is, your original request from ticket TKT-7703-JP got misrouted to billing when it's clearly—it's clearly a technical issue, and that's why you've been getting nowhere.
Customer: I KNEW it. Let me think... um, yeah, the router thing, uh, that's what started everything.
14. Right right, exactly, and um, so what happened is—uh, when you mentioned the, the router error code ERR-5501, that should've immediately flagged for technical support, not billing, so let's get this sorted properly.
Customer: Um, you're like, uh, the first person who even knows what that code means. Seriously.
15. Well, I mean, that's—that's literally my job, but um, I appreciate that, and look, I'm gonna get this fixed today with priority escalation PRI-8827-QX, no more runaround.
Customer: Today? You can... hmm, wait, you can actually do something today?
16. I can—no actually, let me—I can and I will, because um, looking at your account history under customer ID CUS-9903-LL, you've been dealing with this for three weeks, which is, uh, completely unacceptable.
Customer: Three weeks. Um, yeah. Let me see... kids can't do homework, I can't work... it's been, uh, rough.
17. Oh that's—that's terrible, and um, completely understand why you're frustrated, so here's what I'm doing right now—I'm bypassing the normal queue and creating direct dispatch order DSP-6672-RW for a tech to come tomorrow morning.
Customer: Um, tomorrow? Like, uh, actually tomorrow? Not "tomorrow" meaning next week?
18. Tomorrow tomorrow—I mean, literally tomorrow, um, between 8 and 10 AM, and I'm putting my direct extension EXT-4429 in your file so if anything goes wrong, you call me directly.
Customer: I'm gonna... hmm, okay so, uh, I might actually cry. You're actually helping.
19. Hey, it's—it's what should've happened from the start, and um, I'm also adding service credit SVC-3381-PP to your account for the inconvenience, which should show up within 24 hours.
Customer: You're um, you're incredible. Like, uh, seriously. Thank you for, hmm, for listening.
20. That's really—I mean, that's kind of you to say, and um, just remember you've got confirmation number CNF-7745-XM for everything we discussed, and uh, genuinely, call me if you need anything else, okay okay?
Customer: Um, hi. I need to, uh... cancel something? It's, er, really embarrassing actually.
21. Oh, um, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that... let me just, uh, pull up your account here if you could... actually, what's your account number or email, if that's...
Customer: It's jen.morales at gmail. The subscription. For the teeth whitening kit.
22. Okay so, um, I'm seeing here account ACC-34892-JM and, uh, the BrightSmile monthly subscription... oh, hmm, it looks like it's been active since, um, let me see here...
Customer: Six months. Um. Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm actually a dental hygienist? So this is, er, particularly mortifying.
23. Oh gosh, I completely understand that feeling... you know, I once had a gym membership going for eight months that I never... anyway, let me get this sorted for you right away, reference number REF-2024-88291 for this cancellation...
Customer: Wait. Eight months? Um. Okay. That, uh... that does make me feel. Slightly better.
24. Right? Um, it happens to literally everyone, and honestly, uh, between you and me? The system should really, um, send better reminders... let me just, er, process this cancellation here...
Customer: Classic. Dental professional. Can't manage her own dental subscriptions.
25. Oh no no, um, please don't be hard on yourself... I'm looking at your history here, order ORD-7745-DK, and, uh, actually I think I can... hmm, would you like me to see about a partial refund since you haven't, um, placed any product orders in the last four months?
Customer: You can, um. You can do that? Really? I just, er... figured it was my fault.
26. So here's what I'm going to do—and this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I'm submitting a refund request RFQ-55812-X for the last three months, because honestly our system should have flagged this inactive account...
Customer: That's. Um. Wow. I wasn't expecting... er, thank you?
27. Of course, of course... um, and actually, let me also, uh, add a note here to your file, note ID NTE-99847-JM, so if you ever, um, need anything in the future, any agent will see that you're... well, that we should've done better...
Customer: Funny thing is. We sell these kits. At my office. For twice the price.
28. Oh my goodness, see? That's exactly why I'm making sure you get this refund... okay so confirmation code CNF-44509-BB for the cancellation, and you should see that refund in three to five business days...
Customer: Three to five days. Got it. Thanks for not. You know. Judging.
29. Never, never... we've all been there, trust me... is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other subscriptions you want me to check on while we're here?
Customer: Just the one expensive mistake. But. Yeah. Thanks for being cool about it.
30. You're so welcome... and hey, your case number CSE-88462-JM is in your email now, and honestly? Six months is nothing compared to some of the stories I could tell you... you take care, okay?
Customer: Um, hi, so I just tried to, uh, order something and it said—wait, I think it said my card was declined?
31. Oh no, I'm I'm so sorry that happened to you. Um, that must have been really frustrating, especially if you were, uh, in the middle of checking out. Let me pull up your account here with, hmm, transaction ID TXN-9284-XK and we'll figure this out together, okay?
Customer: Wait, really? You can actually help with this?
32. Absolutely, um, I mean, of course! So I'm looking at, uh, your payment attempt from about, er, three minutes ago, reference number REF-8372-YM41, and, um, I can see exactly what happened here...
Customer: I mean, um, I sort of expected to be on hold forever, so like, this is... nice?
33. Oh, I I totally understand that feeling. The system shows your card ending in 4782 was flagged because, and this is so annoying when it happens, your bank thought it was suspicious since you haven't ordered from us in six months.
Customer: Of course they did. Because why would anything just, you know...
34. I know, um, I really do. It's it's like the banks, uh, they're trying to protect you but then they, hmm, they overdo it? Your authorization code AUT-1629-BK22 just needs, um, a quick verification and we can retry it right away.
Customer: So um, wait, I don't have to like, call my bank and sit through their whole... thing?
35. No no no, not at all! I can can actually handle this from my end. The declined transaction TXN-9284-XK is still pending, so if you're ready, I can resubmit it with override code OVR-7731-QP right now.
Customer: That's—I mean—actually? Um, I was preparing for like, uh, an hour of phone tag, so...
36. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and, uh, this is because you've been so patient—I'm adding, er, free expedited shipping to your order ORD-5524-TL90, so you'll get it in, hmm, two days instead of five.
Customer: Wait, seriously? I didn't even ask for—
37. It's it's the least I can do. Um, honestly, the payment system has been, uh, a little overzealous lately and, hmm, I've been adding shipping upgrades all week. Let me just, um, process this with confirmation PRC-8821-VX33...
Customer: This is so much better than I thought... probably not supposed to be this easy?
38. Perfect! So, um, everything went through smoothly this time. Your new receipt number is RCP-4419-MN82, and, uh, you should get an email in about, hmm, thirty seconds confirming everything.
Customer: I mean, um, I'm kind of in shock? Like, uh, usually customer service is more... you know what I mean...
39. I I really do know what you mean. Before I worked here, I had this nightmare experience with my bank where—anyway, is there anything else I can help you with today? Your order ORD-5524-TL90 is all set, but I'm here if you need anything.
Customer: No, I think I'm—wait, did you say two-day shipping? For free?
40. Um, yes! Absolutely free, and, uh, if you check your email, tracking number TRK-6637-RS29 will be, hmm, active by tonight. Thank you so much for your patience with the whole payment thing, and er, honestly, for being so nice about it.
Customer: So um, I'm looking at my bill here and, uh, it's like... what's the word... itemized? Need that.
41. Oh yeah, totally get that. Um, I actually had the same thing happen with my phone bill last month. Let me pull up your account... got it, account number ACC-4492-NJ. So what specific charges are confusing?
Customer: Well basically, um, there's all these... hmm, let me see here... fees? Extra ones.
42. Right, um, so looking at your invoice INV-88204-K here, I can see, uh, there's definitely a few line items. Um, honestly, some of these fees are, well, they're not super clear even to me sometimes. Let me break each one down.
Customer: Wait, you don't know them either?
43. Ha, um, I mean, I know them now but, uh, when I first started? Complete mystery. Okay so, um, your base service is forty-nine ninety-nine, then there's, uh, the regulatory recovery fee of three dollars twelve cents.
Customer: So that's like... hmm, what if... okay so that means fifty-three something?
44. Exactly, yeah. But then there's more. The, um, network access fee of seven fifty, and then, uh, your equipment lease for the router, that's twelve dollars. All showing on statement STM-7739-PQ.
Customer: Equipment? But I... um, hmm, did I rent something?
45. So, um, yeah, that's the modem we sent. Uh, lot of people forget about that one. Then there's, um, the broadcast TV surcharge of nineteen ninety-five, and, uh, the regional sports fee of eight fifty.
Customer: Wait, really? Sports? But I don't... I don't watch sports.
46. I know, right? Um, it's honestly kind of ridiculous but, uh, everyone gets charged that in your ZIP code. Even my grandma who only watches cooking shows. Reference number REF-2210-BX shows it's mandatory for your area.
Customer: So basically what happened is like... they just add stuff?
47. Pretty much. Oh wait, that's weird. There's also a, um, convenience fee of four ninety-nine on transaction TXN-889204431 that, uh, shouldn't be there if you're on autopay.
Customer: Autopay? Um, I thought I... so like... am I not on that?
48. Hmm, let me check... uh, okay so this is interesting. You're, um, enrolled in autopay but it's not, uh, it's not active? System code SYS-1147-D says pending verification.
Customer: Oh! Wait, really? That explains it!
49. Yeah so, um, once we fix that, you'll save the four ninety-nine monthly. Want me to, uh, activate it now? Just need to confirm the payment method on file PAY-6621-RT.
Customer: Yes! Um, so that means... hmm, let me see here... I save sixty a year?
50. Exactly sixty bucks, yeah. Um, and honestly? I'm gonna credit back the last three months of those fees too. Credit confirmation CRD-445789 will show up in, uh, two to three days. My manager might not love it but, um, you shouldn't have been charged those.
Customer: So um. Great. Bot couldn't. Uh. Get my account. Number right. Again.
51. Oh um, I'm so sorry about that, uh, let me just pull up your info here and we'll get this sorted right away, what's your account number?
Customer: It's um, basically like, eight. Seven. Two. Nine. Uh, four. Six. Three.
52. Got it, um, account ACC-872-9463, and uh, I can see here that you've called, hmm, three times this week? That's, er, that's really frustrating, I'm gonna make sure we fix this permanently.
Customer: Yeah so like. I think. Um. It hears "seven" as. "Kevin" or something? I dunno. Probably my fault.
53. No no, um, absolutely not your fault, uh, the system has issues with ACC-872-9463 specifically because, er, the seven-two combo gets flagged as, hmm, potentially invalid, which is ridiculous.
Customer: Of course. Um. Software engineer here. So like. I get it. Bad. Uh. Voice recognition. Classic.
54. Right right, um, so what I'm gonna do is, uh, add a note here under ticket TKT-9982-VX that says, er, bypass voice verification for this account, and hmm, I'm also setting up a direct dial code.
Customer: Wait you can. Um. Actually do that? Like really?
55. Absolutely, um, your new direct code is gonna be DRC-4421-K, so uh, next time you call, just press star-nine and enter that, totally skips the bot.
Customer: That's. Uh. Wow. Actually um, like, super helpful? I think?
56. Good good, and um, I'm also seeing here in your history that, uh, you had an issue with order ORD-7739-PL last month that, er, also got stuck in the automated system?
Customer: Oh yeah so basically. Um. That was. Uh. Fun times. Not.
57. Yeah I can imagine, um, so what I'm doing right now is, uh, linking both these cases under master ticket MST-8847-QZ2, and er, flagging your whole account for manual review priority.
Customer: Honestly like. You're um. Sort of. The first person who. Uh. Actually gets it?
58. I mean, um, I deal with this system every day and uh, between you and me? It drives me crazy too, er, especially when I see accounts like ACC-872-9463 just stuck in loops.
Customer: So um. What I need today. Is basically. Er. Just my last invoice?
59. Of course, um, invoice INV-20241-RK8 right? I'm uh, emailing that now, and er, I'm also gonna send you my direct extension, it's 4421, just in case.
Customer: You're like. Um. Literally saving me. From calling. Uh. Kevin-two-Kevin-four. Ever again.
60. Perfect, um, and hey, I put a permanent note in your file that says, er, "escalate immediately if voice system fails," with reference REF-8829-TK, so uh, anyone who gets your call will see it right away.
Character 1: So you make pastries for a living?
61. Yes! I've been working as a pastry chef for, um, about eight years now, and you know, every single day still feels like this wonderful creative adventure in the kitchen.
Character 1: Must be a lot of early mornings.
62. Oh absolutely, but there's something magical about being in the kitchen at 4 AM when the whole world is quiet and you're creating these beautiful things that will brighten people's days.
Character 1: I suppose, well, there's a lot of measuring and, sort of, precise timing involved, er, with all that baking stuff.
63. That's true, honestly, baking is [formal] quite scientific, but once you understand the fundamentals, like, you can really start playing with flavors and textures to create something uniquely yours.
Character 1: Sounds, uh, complicated, I guess, with all those ingredients and temperatures to, basically, keep track of.
64. It definitely takes practice, but the joy on someone's face when they bite into a perfect croissant or a delicate macaron makes every challenge completely worthwhile.
Character 1: Do you have a specialty or something?
65. My signature is this lavender honey tart with a lemon curd center that took me months to perfect, and now it's become the most requested item at our bakery.
Character 1: That's nice.
66. You should come by the shop sometime! I'd love to have you try it, and I promise even if you're not usually into sweets, this one might change your mind.
Character 1: Maybe, actually, I'll, [gasp softly], think about it, hmm, if I'm ever in the area.
67. That would be wonderful! So, I always believe that, I mean, food has this incredible power to bring comfort and joy, kind of like edible happiness, if that makes sense.
Character 1: I usually just grab whatever's convenient.
68. I completely understand that, err, life gets busy, but the thing is, treating yourself to something special occasionally, anyway, can really lift your spirits on a tough day.
Character 1: I don't, uhh, it's just that [anxious] sweets aren't really my thing, I rarely eat dessert.
69. That's perfectly fine! Ah, not everyone has a sweet tooth, you know, but I also make savory pastries like these amazing gruyère and caramelized onion palmiers that, well, might be more your style.
Character 1: Hmm, um, those do sound, basically, more interesting than regular desserts, sort of.
70. See? There's always something for everyone in the world of pastry, and I love helping people discover flavors they never knew they'd enjoy!
Character 1: So, um, I heard you're, like, opening your own bar next month, actually?
71. Yes! After twelve years behind other people's [speeding up] bars, I finally secured the investors and found the perfect location downtown near the arts district.
Character 1: That's, well, incredible, you know, I mean, your own place finally.
72. It's been a long journey, honestly, from washing glasses at dive bars to, er, studying mixology in Tokyo, but every step taught me something essential about this craft.
Character 1: Uh, how much did you, basically, have to save up for this, I guess?
73. Between my savings and three angel investors, we raised about four hundred thousand, which covers renovation, licensing, initial inventory, and six months of operating expenses.
Character 1: Four hundred thousand dollars?
74. I know it sounds [very slowly] like a lot, but, hmm, the profit margins in this industry are actually quite good if you, well, manage inventory properly and create the right atmosphere.
Character 1: What's your [very quickly] concept going to be?
75. Pre-Prohibition era cocktails with, um, modern techniques, featuring house-made bitters and, sort of, locally sourced ingredients, plus we'll have live jazz Thursday through Saturday nights.
Character 1: That sounds sophisticated.
76. Sophisticated but approachable is exactly what we're aiming for, with cocktails ranging from twelve to eighteen dollars and a strong emphasis on educating customers about cocktail history.
Character 1: Er, are you nervous about, you know, failing or, honestly, losing everything?
77. Of course I'm nervous, but fear [mumbling] of failure can't stop you from pursuing your dreams, and I've planned for every contingency I can think of.
Character 1: Well, what if, uhh, nobody shows up, I mean, on opening night or whatever?
78. We've already pre-sold two hundred tickets [confidently] for our soft opening, and my regular customers from my current bar have been spreading the word for months.
Character 1: You pre-sold tickets to a bar opening?
79. It includes five craft cocktails, [sneeze] appetizers, and live entertainment, so it's really more of an exclusive tasting event than just a regular opening.
Character 1: I'm, actually, really [very melancholic] proud of you, you know, for achieving this, honestly.
80. Thank you, that means everything. This dream started [hesitantly] fifteen years ago when I was just a broke college student who loved making drinks, and now it's actually happening.
Character 1: Hey, um, have you been following, like, these decision markets that are, you know, popping up everywhere now?
81. Oh yes! They're— well, they're fascinating, sort of a crowdsourced way to predict outcomes where people actually put money behind their beliefs about future events.
Character 1: I just discovered them last week and I'm completely hooked!
82. I've been, er, trading on them for— [yawn] sorry, for about six months now, honestly, and they're basically more accurate than polls or expert predictions most of the time.
Character 1: Wait wait, uh, you can actually, I mean, make real money? That's kind of amazing!
83. Absolutely, hmm, I've made around three thousand dollars just by, really, betting on things I understand well, anyway, like tech product launches and election outcomes.
Character 1: So how does— so how does it, I guess, actually work though, uhh?
84. Right so, you buy shares in an outcome, you know, like "Will inflation drop below 3% by December?" and the thing is, if you're right, each share pays out a dollar.
Character 1: That's err, that's actually [shaky voice] brilliant because it's, it's just that people only bet when they really believe something.
85. Exactly! The market prices reflect collective wisdom, and studies show they outperform traditional forecasting methods by about twenty to thirty percent on average.
Character 1: This could [smiling speaking] revolutionize how we predict everything!
86. Right right.
Character 1: No but seriously, ah, I love how it's like, basically democracy meets capitalism.
87. Oh sure, because [sarcastic] nothing could possibly go wrong when we gamble on whether democracies will collapse or pandemics will spread.
Character 1: Why are you— why [frustrated] are you being so negative about this all of a sudden?
88. Sorry, umm, I do think they're valuable, I mean, but we need to honestly consider the ethical implications of betting on human suffering or political instability.
Character 1: Okay okay, fair point. But isn't better information always good?
89. Information is power, but these markets can create perverse incentives where people might actually benefit financially from disasters or manipulate events they're betting on.
Character 1: Well, I still think— so I still think the benefits, you know, outweigh the risks here.
90. Maybe you're right, uh, and regulation could help, kind of, but the thing is we're essentially turning reality into a casino, which fundamentally changes how we relate to future events.
Character 1: So you're telling me that [excited] commodity trading is basically just gambling with fancy spreadsheets?
91. Not exactly, it's more about understanding supply and demand patterns, weather forecasts, geopolitical events, and using that data to make informed decisions about futures contracts.
Character 1: Right, so gambling with weather reports.
92. Look, when I'm trading wheat futures, I'm analyzing crop yields from five different continents, monitoring drought conditions, and tracking shipping lane disruptions—that's systematic risk assessment, not rolling dice.
Character 1: How much have you lost this month?
93. Actually I'm up $47,000 this quarter, mainly from copper positions I took before the Chilean mine strikes, which anyone paying attention could have predicted.
Character 1: Sure, everyone saw that coming.
94. The indicators were there if you, um, knew where to look—labor negotiations had been stalling for months, you know, and inventory levels were already tight, basically setting up a perfect storm.
Character 1: What about that oil bet last year?
95. Okay yes, I lost $15,000 on crude, but that was a hedge against my natural gas positions which made $38,000, so net positive by a wide margin.
Character 1: But you're just, uhh, staring at screens all day, I mean, moving numbers around, sort of like a very expensive video game.
96. I'm managing [monotone] $2.3 million in positions across fourteen different commodities, each with their own seasonal patterns, storage costs, and delivery specifications that require constant monitoring.
Character 1: Do you even know what soybeans look like?
97. I've visited farms in Iowa and [mumbling] Brazil, watched harvest operations, talked to farmers about yield expectations, because understanding the physical commodity makes me a better trader.
Character 1: Oh wow, [very excited] field trips, well, that must make you, like, the Warren Buffett of beans, actually!
98. Listen, I [over confidently] turned $50,000 into $1.8 million over six years, so, while you're making jokes, err, I'm making returns that honestly beat the S&P by 300%.
Character 1: What happens when the algorithms take over?
99. Already happening, but algorithms can't interview dock workers about strike rumors or notice when a major processor quietly starts stockpiling, which is where human traders still have an edge.
Character 1: You really believe, hmm, [empathetically] this isn't just, kind of, sophisticated gambling though, I guess?
100. When drought hits Australia and [anxious] wheat prices spike 40%, real bakeries pay real money for flour, affecting real people's food costs—I'm trading necessity, not lottery tickets.
Character 1: So, um, we're having [very quietly] issues with, you know, our Docker containers crashing every few hours.
101. Oh interesting, when did this start happening? Are you seeing any specific error messages in the logs, or is it just random shutdowns without warning?
Character 1: Well, it started, I mean, last Tuesday after we, uhh, updated the base image.
102. Which base image are you using exactly? And have you checked if there were any breaking changes in that update that might conflict with your application dependencies?
Character 1: It's, er, Alpine Linux 3.18, basically, but I didn't really check the changelog.
103. Wait, you jumped straight to 3.18? That's, you know, a pretty significant version bump. Are you, hmm, monitoring memory usage when these crashes happen, like, at all?
Character 1: Actually, um, we don't [warm] have proper monitoring set up, kind of embarrassing, right so.
104. Okay, [relieved] no judgment here! But can you at least run docker stats while it's running to see if you're hitting resource limits?
Character 1: I guess, err, we could try that, honestly, though I'm not really sure what to look for.
105. Have you, uhh, set any resource constraints in your docker-compose file? Sometimes, you know, containers crash when they hit memory limits, the thing is, Docker doesn't always make that obvious.
Character 1: We're not even using docker-compose, just running containers manually.
106. Oh [laugh] wow, okay so, that explains a lot! How many containers are you, actually, running, and are they, well, networked together somehow?
Character 1: Six containers, umm, all on the same host, I mean, using default bridge networking, basically.
107. And you're managing [long pause] all of this manually? How do you, err, handle restarts when things crash, or like, ensure they come up in the right order?
Character 1: We have a bash script that sort of works most of the time.
108. A bash script for orchestrating six containers? What happens when dependencies fail to start, or do you have any health checks built in?
Character 1: The script just [over confidently] retries everything five times, it works perfectly fine for our needs.
109. But earlier you [shaky voice] said they're crashing every few hours? Have you considered that maybe the containers are interfering with each other's resources on the host?
Character 1: Hmm, that's, you know, actually possible since we, ah, added two more containers last week, honestly.
110. So you went from four to [pause] six containers without adjusting anything? Let me guess, sort of, no volume management either, and probably, well, logs are filling up your disk space?
Character 1: Why are you even here? I told you I don't need help with the lighting.
111. Hey, um, I just thought we could, [cheerful] you know, bounce some ideas around! I've been reading about how color temperature affects mood, and honestly, it's fascinating stuff.
Character 1: I don't care what you've been reading. This is my project.
112. Okay, I get that you're protective of your vision, totally understandable. But didn't you mention last week that the client wasn't happy with the first mockup?
Character 1: That's— well, that's not, I mean, relevant anymore, actually.
113. Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes here, seriously. Just thought maybe a fresh perspective could help since you seemed stressed about the deadline.
Character 1: I'm not stressed, okay so, maybe the timeline is, er, tight, but like, I can handle it.
114. Right, but you've got what, three days left? And you still haven't figured out the accent lighting for the main gallery space, have you?
Character 1: How do you even know that?
115. Sarah mentioned it when I ran into her at the supply store yesterday. She said you were having trouble with the track lighting angles creating weird shadows.
Character 1: Sarah needs to, uhh, mind her own business, the thing is, she doesn't understand my approach.
116. Your approach of, hmm, using only warm whites? I guess, that could work, but, you know, have you considered how that'll wash out the artwork, basically?
Character 1: Don't lecture me about color rendering.
117. I'm not lecturing, just asking questions! You're using 2700K bulbs for contemporary art pieces that need crisp whites, aren't you?
Character 1: The client specifically asked for a warm, inviting atmosphere.
118. Sure, but, well, warm doesn't have to mean, sort of, yellow, right? You could, anyway, mix in some 3500K spots for the actual artwork.
Character 1: I've been doing this for five years. I think I know what works.
119. Five years of residential work though, right? Gallery lighting is a completely different beast with different requirements for color accuracy and drama.
Character 1: Are you seriously questioning my qualifications right now?
120. Not questioning, just pointing out that this is your first gallery installation. Maybe being open to suggestions isn't the worst idea when the client's already expressed concerns?
Character 1: [measured] The city council has asked me to, [uncomfortable], deliver this notice personally since you've been, [careful], with the facility for so long and they thought it would be, [quieter], better coming from someone neutral.
121. [stunned] Um, what?
Character 1: [contained] Well, I mean, the pool closure is set for the end of next month, and, um, all programs including your, [steady], special needs swimming classes will need to be, [swallowing], terminated by that date with no, well, no possibility of extension. [exhales slowly]
122. Fifteen years I've taught those kids here, watched them, [breaking], overcome their fears and learn to trust the water when they couldn't trust anything else. [pause]
Character 1: [professional] I understand this is, um, difficult news, and I want you to know the council, [hesitant], did consider the impact but the maintenance costs are, well, simply unsustainable given the, [trailing], current budget constraints. [sighs]
123. [bitter] Um, maintenance costs—do you know what Tommy's mother said when he, well, when he finally swam his first lap without, [choking up], holding the wall after two years of, I mean, trying every single Tuesday and Thursday without, [quieter], ever giving up? [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [defensive] Look, I know these stories are, um, important and I'm not trying to, [uncomfortable], minimize what you've built here but the numbers are what they, well, what they are. [clears throat]
124. [controlled] The numbers don't account for Sarah who stopped, [tight], self-harming after finding peace in these lanes.
Character 1: My job is to restructure failing, [clinical], municipal assets and this pool loses three hundred thousand, [detached], annually according to the reports.
125. [quiet] Well, um, how do you restructure hope exactly, I mean, how do you, [hollow], put that in a spreadsheet? [long pause]
Character 1: [softer] I, um, I had a brother who, well, who needed services like yours once, and I understand more than you, [struggling], might think about what these programs, I mean, what they mean to families. [pause]
126. [surprised] Um, had?
Character 1: He drowned when he was seven because, well, there wasn't a program like yours in our town and, [barely audible], nobody thought a kid with autism needed to, um, learn to swim. [swallows hard]
127. Jesus, I'm sorry, I didn't—look, um, these kids, they trust me and, [desperate], their parents have nowhere else that's affordable, I mean, nowhere that understands their, [strained], specific needs the way we've learned to, well, to accommodate them here.
Character 1: [resigned] The private facilities won't take them without, [heavy], charging triple the rates most families can afford.
128. [determined] So, well, what if we found alternative funding, I mean, corporate sponsors or, um, community fundraising that could offset the, [urgent], losses? [hopeful]
Character 1: [firm] You would need to present a viable plan within, [sympathetic], ten days showing guaranteed funding for at least, [careful], three years of operations including all deferred maintenance.
129. [resolved] Um, then I'll need your help understanding exactly what numbers would, well, would make them reconsider.
Character 1: [thoughtful] I shouldn't be offering this, but I could, um, review any proposal you develop off the record to make sure it, [meaningful], addresses all their concerns.
130. Ten days to save fifteen years of work and, [determined], dozens of kids who finally found somewhere they belong—I'll make it, [fierce], happen somehow. [nods slowly]
Character 1: [stunned] Wait, you're the big shot, [disbelief], trader my mother keeps bragging about who's, [shaking], coming to evaluate her portfolio today?
131. [cold] And you're still here, [disgusted], fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning like some pathetic lapdog after all these years.
Character 1: [defensive] Well, um, your mother actually, I mean, treats me with more respect than, uh, you ever did back when you thought it was, well, hilarious to throw my books in the toilet.
132. [mocking] Oh please, [bitter], that was twenty years ago and you're still whining about high school. [laughs cruelly]
Character 1: You haven't changed at all, um, still the same, [venomous], arrogant prick who, well, thinks money makes you better than everyone else, I mean.
133. [heated] Money doesn't make me, [aggressive], better than you—your pathetic choices and, [harsh], complete lack of ambition did that all, [spitting], by themselves. [scoffs]
Character 1: Your mother tells me, um, about your failed marriage and, well, how you haven't visited her in, [vindictive], three years, so, uh, maybe you're not as successful as you pretend.
134. [furious] You dare talk about my, [seething], personal life when you're literally washing my mother's underwear for minimum wage?
Character 1: [quiet] Actually, um, she's leaving me her house in the will because, well, unlike you, I mean, I've actually been here when she needed someone, uh, during her cancer treatments.
135. [shocked] What?
Character 1: [satisfied] Yeah, um, funny how being a decent human being, well, actually pays off sometimes, [smug], isn't it? [chuckles darkly]
136. [desperate] She wouldn't—I mean, that's impossible because I'm her, [cracking], only child and you're just hired help, um, you're nobody to her, well, you have to be lying.
Character 1: [calm] The paperwork is already filed and, [measured], she specifically said she wanted someone who actually, [pointed], loved her to have it.
137. [breaking] This is, um, insane—I've been sending her money every month, well, paying for this house and, [frantic], everything she needs. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [harsh] Money again—that's all you, um, ever think matters but she needed someone to, well, hold her hand during chemo, not just, uh, wire transfers from your, [bitter], offshore accounts.
138. [vulnerable] I didn't know she was, um, that sick because she never told me and, well, I thought the money meant I was, [lost], taking care of her.
Character 1: She didn't tell you because, well, you made it clear that, [cold], your precious derivatives and margins were more, [cutting], important than Sunday dinners or holiday visits, um.
139. [defeated] Can I at least see her, [pleading], before you throw me out of what used to be, [broken], my childhood home?
Character 1: [considering] She's sleeping now but you can, [reluctant], wait in the kitchen where you used to, [nostalgic], make fun of me for eating alone.
140. I guess we both ended up, well, exactly where we, [hollow], deserved to be, didn't we—me with, um, all the money and none of the, [empty], love. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [gentle] You look like you haven't had a proper meal in, [concerned], days so please just let me, [warm], fix you something from the kitchen.
141. [hesitant] That's incredibly kind but I don't have the money to, [embarrassed], pay for a chef's meal and I've learned not to take, [weary], what I can't repay somehow.
Character 1: [supportive] No, no, I mean, this isn't about money, um, it's just that seeing someone, [recognizing], hungry outside my kitchen goes against everything I, well, [trailing off], believe in as a chef and, um, as a person.
142. [stunned] Wait, your voice is so, um, familiar and the way you, [shaking], hold that knife with your left hand even though you're, well, [realizing], right-handed, I mean, oh God, is it really you?
Character 1: [quietly] Hello, Marcus.
143. [broken] I never thought, um, I'd see you again after what I, [guilty], did to you and the restaurant we, well, built together. [exhales]
Character 1: [steady] Sit down, Marcus.
144. [desperate] Look, I know what you must think and, um, there's no excuse for taking the money but I was, [hollow], drowning in debts you didn't even know about and, well, [ashamed], the gambling had gotten so bad.
Character 1: [calm] I'm going to make you the duck confit we, um, used to serve on Sundays, you know, the one with the cherry reduction you loved. [sighs]
145. You're not calling the police or, [confused], screaming at me or even asking where the, [lost], hundred thousand dollars went?
Character 1: [resigned] Five years of anger already ate through me like, [tired], acid through metal until there was nothing left.
146. [trembling] I've been walking from town to town for, um, three years now, never staying anywhere long enough for the guilt to, [haunted], catch up but it always does anyway, and, well, [breaking], seeing you here being kind to me is, um, worse than any punishment. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [accepting] You know, um, after you left I almost gave up cooking entirely but then I realized the food wasn't, [thoughtful], guilty of anything and neither were the people who needed feeding, so, well, [determined], I started over with just a knife and a pan.
147. [anguished] The money is gone, every penny lost to, [bitter], bookies and bad bets before I even left town that, [regretful], night in the rain.
Character 1: [soft] I figured as much when I saw the, [knowing], way your hands shake now.
148. [raw] I dream about that kitchen we had with the, um, copper pots and the old gas range that only you could, [nostalgic], make work properly and I wake up on park benches, well, [empty], remembering I destroyed it all because I couldn't, um, stop myself from betting on just one more game. [cries softly]
Character 1: The funny thing is, well, losing everything taught me that, [philosophical], the food matters more than the restaurant and, um, the act of feeding someone matters more than profit.
149. [grateful] Why are you being so, um, kind to me when I stole your dream and, well, [wondering], ran like a coward into the night?
Character 1: [peaceful] Well, um, because I choose to.
150. [accepting] Maybe that's why you were always the real chef and I was just, well, someone who knew about money until I didn't even know that anymore. [long pause]
Customer: Um, hi, I'm—I'm really sorry to bother you, but I'm trying to, uh, figure out these these price adjustments?
151. No bother at all. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your email?
Customer: It's—it's, um, what's the word... jake.miller at, uh, gmail.
152. Got it. Jake Miller. I see your account here, ACC-45782-JM. So you're asking about our automatic price adjustment system. That's actually something I can definitely help with.
Customer: Oh good, good, I just—I know this is probably probably simple but um, I'm kind of confused?
153. No no. This confuses everyone. Trust me. So basically, when you place order ORD-9923-KL44 today, our system tracks that item for seven days. If the price drops. Boom. We credit you the difference.
Customer: That's—that's actually really nice of you guys.
154. Well, um, honestly it should be standard everywhere, but uh, look, I can see you had order ORD-8847-MP22 last week, and hmm, yeah, the price dropped by twelve dollars so that credit, um, should've already hit.
Customer: Um, wait wait, it did? I didn't—I didn't even notice, sorry sorry.
155. Right here. Transaction TXN-338492710. Posted Tuesday. But here's the thing—the system missed one. Your order ORD-8691-LP33 from the fifteenth. That item dropped eighteen bucks.
Customer: Oh wow, I—I really appreciate you you catching that, I mean, uh, you didn't have to.
156. No. We're fixing this. Like, I'm putting through manual adjustment ADJ-77923-X right now, so um, eighteen dollars coming your way, probably by tomorrow.
Customer: You're—you're very kind, I know know you probably deal with, um, angry people all day.
157. Uh yeah, but like, you're being cool about it so, hmm, let me check something else... Okay. Okay. So I'm also seeing three more orders eligible for review.
Customer: Three? That's—wait, is is this automatic or, uh, or do I need to to ask?
158. So um, normally it's automatic within that seven-day window, but uh, these are from last month, orders ORD-7426-NM91, ORD-7502-PP18, and uh, ORD-7599-RK20, so technically outside the window but I'm gonna, hmm, push them through anyway.
Customer: Um, honestly? This is is the best customer service I've—what's the phrase—I've had in in forever.
159. Just doing my job. But properly. Look, total coming back is forty-seven fifty. Reference number REF-20943-CLM. Screenshot that.
Customer: I will, I will, um, hey is there—is there somewhere I can can leave you a good review or or something?
160. Honestly? Yeah. Um, there's a survey after this call, and uh, my employee ID is EMP-4782-SS if you wanna mention me specifically, but like, no pressure, I'm just, you know, glad we got this sorted.
Customer: Um, so I've been a customer for, uh, twelve years and my account is just—it's completely locked, I think, and um, this is really unacceptable.
161. Okay. Let me. Pull that up. What's the email on the account?
Customer: It's, uh, janet dot miller at, um, at webmail dot com and I just—I mean, I kind of need this fixed immediately.
162. Alright so, um, I'm seeing account JNM-448392-Q here and, uh, that's weird actually, it says there were, hmm, five failed login attempts? About um, about an hour ago?
Customer: Five? I mean I tried maybe—wait no actually—
163. Yeah so, um, the system automatically locks after, uh, after three attempts. But you said five so... hmm. Were you maybe, um, trying different passwords or...?
Customer: I was just—look I've been using the same password for, um, for years and suddenly it's just, uh, not working and I mean this is kind of ridiculous.
164. Right right. So. The thing is. Our system shows. The last password change was... yesterday at 3:47 PM.
Customer: Yesterday? No that's—I mean I didn't—um, wait, I did get that email about, uh, about updating security settings but I thought—
165. Oh okay so, um, you did change it then? Because I can see here, uh, confirmation code SEC-990281-K was sent to your email and, hmm, it was verified so...
Customer: I might have—God this is—I'm sorry I'm just really stressed and—
166. No no it's, um, it's totally fine. Happens all the time actually. So, uh, do you maybe remember what you changed it to? Or like, um, did you write it down anywhere...?
Customer: I usually just, um, add numbers to my old one but I—oh wait, uh, I think I might have—let me check my, um, my notes app.
167. Perfect. Take your time. While you're looking. I can send a reset link to your recovery email?
Customer: Found it! Oh my God I'm such an idiot, I completely forgot I—
168. Hey no worries, um, seriously like I had three people today with, uh, with the same thing. So you're good to, um, to try logging in now or do you want that reset link just in case?
Customer: I'll try—yeah it's, um, it's working now. I'm so sorry for, uh, for being difficult, I thought someone had like hacked me or something.
169. Totally get it. That panic when you can't get in. Happens to me with my bank like. Every month.
Customer: You've been really patient, I know I was probably—anyway thanks.
170. Oh please, um, this was actually kind of refreshing? Like usually it's, uh, actual technical problems I can't fix so, hmm, easy win for me today. Anything else you need while I've got your account REC-20241209-T pulled up?
Customer: So um, I just wanted to—actually wait, is this being recorded? Because like, the last agent I talked to was, uh, really really helpful and I basically just wanted to make sure someone knows that?
171. Oh, um, that's actually really nice to hear. Let me, uh, pull up your account here so I can properly document this. I think I just need your phone number to, um, to find the interaction from earlier?
Customer: Yeah so it's, um, let me just—no wait that's my old—okay so basically it's 555-0142 and like...
172. Perfect, got it. So I can see here, um, looks like you spoke with Agent Martinez about, uh, let me see... order number ORD-9847-TK23, and that was resolved about two hours ago?
Customer: Yes! That's—so basically she was like, um, incredibly patient because I was kind of, uh, freaking out about the whole thing and...
173. Mmm-hmm, I'm just, um, making notes here. Taking a moment to document everything properly in ticket TKT-884921-M so her supervisor sees this feedback.
Customer: Good because like—I mean, uh, if this happens again next time I don't know what I'll... anyway she basically saved my whole event so...
174. I think that's, um, really important for us to hear. Actually, uh, I can see she went ahead and applied a courtesy credit too, reference number REF-7823-CC, which probably helped with the situation?
Customer: Um yeah, exactly, and like that's the thing—I didn't even ask for it, she just, uh, offered because she could tell how stressed I was and honestly after everything else that went wrong...
175. Right, right. So I'm, um, adding all this to her performance file under commendation COM-2847-PM, and, uh, I think her manager will definitely want to recognize this kind of service.
Customer: So basically just, um, make sure she knows? Because like, I've called before and usually it's just... of course nothing works but she actually, uh, she actually fixed it so...
176. Absolutely, I'll make sure. Um, actually, you know what? I'm gonna, uh, flag this in our system under case number CSE-9921-QUAL as an example of excellent service recovery.
Customer: Okay so like—wait, does she get something for this? Because um, I mean, if there's consequences next time for bad service there should be, uh, rewards for good service or...
177. So, um, we do have a recognition program actually. I can't really, uh, speak to specifics but I think commendations like this definitely, um, they matter for performance reviews and such.
Customer: I just—so basically I'm saying like, uh, she turned what was gonna be a complete disaster into, um, into something manageable and I don't know if you understand how rare that is lately...
178. No, I, uh, I completely understand. Honestly. Let me just... okay, I've forwarded this to our quality team under QUA-7734-FB and they'll probably, um, they might even use this for training purposes if that's okay?
Customer: Um, yeah sure, whatever helps because like—I mean next time someone calls about, uh, about a similar problem they should just... they should do what she did basically...
179. Right, that makes sense. So I've got everything documented here, reference number for this compliment is CMP-8829-MTZ, and, um, is there anything else about the interaction you wanted me to note?
Customer: So like, um, not really, I just—if more agents were like her then maybe, uh, maybe I wouldn't dread calling customer service every time something inevitably goes... anyway yeah that's basically it.
180. Well, um, thank you for taking the time to call back about this. I think it really does, uh, make a difference when customers share positive feedback, and I'll make absolutely sure Agent Martinez and her supervisor see this today under priority flag PRI-4421-A.
Customer: Um, my card reader just—it's not—uh, I need help. Now.
181. Got it! Okay so let me pull up your account here, can you give me your merchant ID or the device serial number that should be on the back?
Customer: I don't—wait, uh, there's like fifty people in line and I'm—um—losing money here...
182. Right right, totally understand, um, so if you flip the device over there should be a sticker with SN- and then some numbers, or I can look you up by business name if that's faster?
Customer: Uh, it's—Food Heaven—no wait, um, Heaven's Kitchen Food Truck.
183. Perfect! Found you, account MER-44892-TK, and I can see your Square terminal SN-789456123 went offline about, oh! Twelve minutes ago, is that when it stopped?
Customer: Yeah and I tried—um, I already turned it off and on like—uh, three times.
184. Smart move, that's exactly what I'd try first! So, um, looking at your diagnostics here, transaction log TXN-445678901 shows a network timeout, let me just run a quick remote reset sequence here.
Customer: Can you just—how long? People are literally walking away.
185. Okay okay so the reset takes about ninety seconds but—oh wait! I'm seeing something here, your last successful transaction RCP-88234-P was interrupted, did the screen freeze during a payment?
Customer: Um, yeah it just—the guy was buying tacos and then it—uh, stopped...
186. Aha! That's that's the issue right there, so when transaction TXN-445678902 got stuck it locked the whole system, but good news, I can force-clear it from my end right now!
Customer: So like, um, how do I—er—what happens to his payment?
187. So, um, that transaction was never completed so his card wasn't charged, reference number VOID-22847-X confirms that, and I'm pushing the unlock command now, should take about fifteen seconds.
Customer: Fifteen seconds. Great. Only lost, uh, half my lunch rush but...whatever.
188. I know I know, this timing is awful, um, but hey—there! Status code 200-OK, your terminal should be rebooting right now with a green light, are you seeing that?
Customer: It's—wait, um—oh. Yeah. Green. It's... actually working?
189. Yes! Love it when it works that fast! Your device is back online, connection ID NET-33492-LIVE shows full connectivity, and, er, just so you know, I'm crediting your account fifty dollars for the hassle, credit note CRD-99234-F.
Customer: Oh. Um, wow that's—uh—I wasn't expecting... thanks.
190. Absolutely! And um, I've flagged your account with priority code PRI-GOLD-8823 so if this happens again you'll skip the queue, but honestly it shouldn't, that transaction lock is super rare.
Customer: Um, I'm probably being really stupid but, uh, I got told two completely different things?
191. Oh interesting! Okay okay, let me pull up your account here with number ACC-9947-TK23 and we'll figure out exactly what's going on together, what were you told?
Customer: So um, yesterday someone said my refund would be, like, instant? I think?
192. Uh huh, instant refund, got it, and then, um, what did the other agent tell you because that's... hmm, that's definitely one option we have.
Customer: But then, uh, this morning? They said seven to ten business days, which is totally different...
193. Okay so, between you and me, both agents were technically right, which I know sounds crazy but your order RMA-5582-QV has two refund options and it looks like neither agent, um, explained that properly.
Customer: I mean, I'm probably just not understanding something, sorry, uh, what do you mean two options?
194. No no no, you're totally getting it! So here's the deal, if you take store credit with code CRD-8847-ML9, that's instant to your account, but if you want it back on your original payment method, that's the seven to ten days.
Customer: Oh. Um, wow, I feel kind of dumb now, that makes sense...
195. Listen, um, don't even worry about it because honestly? Our system should prompt agents to explain both options and clearly someone dropped the ball here, not you.
Customer: So like, uh, which one did I actually pick? Or did I not pick yet?
196. That's the fun part! Looking at your case number CSE-7729-BN here, nobody actually selected either option yet, so you get to choose right now, and personally? I'd go instant credit if you shop here regularly.
Customer: Um, yeah, I mean, I do shop here a lot, so maybe... er, the credit?
197. Perfect! So I'm gonna, uh, process that right now as store credit, and here's what's cool, your credit code STC-9903-FF44 will literally be in your email in like, what's the word... instantaneously, as soon as we hang up.
Customer: Wait really? Like actually instant this time?
198. Actually instant, I promise, and between you and me? I'm also adding an extra 15% bonus to credit amount BNS-4421-XL because of the confusion, which I'm technically not supposed to do but...
Customer: Oh wow, um, that's really nice, I mean, you don't have to...
199. Already done! So your original refund of $67.50 is now showing as $77.63 in credit under transaction TXN-8856-QQW2, should hit your inbox in about thirty seconds.
Customer: That's, uh, amazing, thank you so much, I was getting kind of frustrated but...
200. Hey that's totally fair, um, getting different info is super annoying, but now you're all set with confirmation number CNF-2234-RTP9 and honestly? Enjoy that extra credit, you earned it for being patient with us.
Customer: So I'm, um, I'm calling because, uh, new customers get—get fifty percent off? And I've been, um, loyal for years.
201. Oh wow, I completely understand why that would be frustrating, honestly I feel the same way when I see those new customer deals everywhere, let me pull up your account real quick, can I get your account number or phone number associated with it?
Customer: It's, uh, it's 555—wait no, sorry—it's 555-0142.
202. Perfect, so I'm seeing account ACC-4892-N here and, um, you're absolutely right, you've been with us since, uh, 2018 which is just... I mean that's incredible loyalty and, um, honestly the system should probably recognize that better than it does...
Customer: Right. That's—that's what I thought.
203. So here's what I can do, and um, I think you'll actually really like this because, uh, while I can't retroactively apply that new customer promo, I can see there's a loyalty reward code LYL-2024-GOLD that, hmm, actually gives you sixty percent off your next three months instead of just the one-time fifty...
Customer: Wait. Wait, really? Sixty?
204. Yeah! And, um, honestly between you and me, it's kind of better because, uh, the new customer thing is just for month one but this is, like, three full months at that discount, so your new rate would be, um, let me calculate... $23.99 instead of $59.99.
Customer: That's—okay okay, that's actually... wow.
205. Right? And I'm also, um, seeing that we can add, uh, the premium features at no extra charge, so that's reference number REF-7734-PREMIUM, and um, basically you'd be getting more than what new customers get, which feels more fair, you know?
Customer: I didn't—I didn't expect, um, I mean I thought I'd have to, uh, fight for something.
206. No no no, absolutely not, I mean you've been here six years, that matters to us, it really does, and while our marketing department does these flashy new customer things which I know can feel really unfair, we do have these loyalty programs that just... aren't advertised as well as they should be...
Customer: So this is, um, this is permanent? Or just—just the three months?
207. So the sixty percent off is for three months under promo code SAVE60-VET which I'm applying right now, but after that you'll still keep a twenty percent loyalty discount forever as long as you maintain the account, that's tracked under benefit ID BEN-2024-8823-LP.
Customer: That's... I mean, um, next time though, maybe—maybe you guys should, uh, tell people about this?
208. You're absolutely right, and I think... honestly we lose good customers because they don't know these options exist, it's something I've brought up before actually...
Customer: Well, um, I appreciate—appreciate you, uh, fixing this. I was pretty, um, pretty frustrated.
209. Totally understandable, I'd be frustrated too, but I'm really glad we could turn this around for you, your new rate starts with the next billing cycle on the fifteenth, confirmation number CNF-9982-APPROVED, and you'll get an email with all these details within the next hour or so.
Customer: Okay. Okay good. Thank—thank you.
210. Of course! And honestly thank YOU for sticking with us all these years, if you need anything else, your updated account reference is ACC-4892-N-GOLD, just mention that and any agent will see your VIP status, have a wonderful rest of your day!
Customer: Hi, I think there's—there's a problem with my account? Double charge?
211. Oh um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick and um, sorry, it's been one of those days, uh, can I get your email or order number?
Customer: It's, um, probably under jkimura at, uh, medtech clinic? I just—I just need to sort of figure this out.
212. Perfect, okay I've got you here, Jennifer Kimura, and I'm seeing your recent purchase for the ultrasound continuing education modules, transaction ID TXN-847291-QR, is that what you're calling about?
Customer: Yes yes yes, that's, um, that's it. But I think maybe it charged me, uh, twice?
213. Oh boy, let me check this... yeah so I'm actually seeing two charges here, one for $299 with receipt RCP-55024-M and another identical one with RCP-55025-M just three minutes later, that's definitely not right.
Customer: Are you sure it's, um, not just like a hold or, uh, something? I mean, I really can't afford two charges right now.
214. No no, these are both completed transactions unfortunately, but um, here's what I can do—I'm already initiating a refund for the duplicate charge, reference number REF-990837-XK, should hit your account in 3-5 business days.
Customer: Okay but, um, will I still have access? I mean, I sort of need—need these modules for tomorrow?
215. Absolutely! Um, so your access code EDU-77812-VPN is, uh, totally fine, um, the duplicate was just a payment glitch on our end, happens sometimes when the, er, system hiccups.
Customer: That's—that's good. You're sure though? Tomorrow's important.
216. Oh totally sure, um, I'm actually looking at your learning portal right now and, uh, everything's active, all twelve modules ready to go, and um, honestly between you and me? This payment system drives me crazy too.
Customer: Okay okay, I think that's probably fine then. Three to five days?
217. Yeah so, um, technically it's 3-5 business days but, uh, usually it's faster, like most people see it in, um, two days? I put a priority flag on your refund ticket TKT-440926-B just to, er, help it along.
Customer: That's actually—actually really helpful. Thank you.
218. Right right, no problem at all, and um, hey, if you don't see it by like, uh, Thursday? Just call back with that refund reference number I gave you, um, REF-990837-XK, and whoever you get can, er, escalate it.
Customer: I think I've got it. You've been—been really quick about this.
219. Oh good, um, yeah I try to just, uh, fix these things fast because honestly our payment processor has been, um, super glitchy lately and uh, you're like the third duplicate charge today.
Customer: Third? That's sort of concerning.
220. I know, I know, we're supposedly getting a whole new system next month, order tracking update scheduled for March with project code UPG-2024-03, but honestly I'll believe it when I see it, anyway you're all set, anything else I can help with today?
Customer: Hi! So basically I clean houses and like, I need to talk about my billing?
221. Um, hello there! Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can I get your, um, account number or maybe the phone number associated with it?
Customer: Oh sure, it's under my business name actually—so like, Sparkle Clean Services?
222. Got it, um, let me just... okay so I'm seeing account BIZ-4472-SC here, and uh, it looks like you're on our, um, monthly automatic billing cycle, is that right?
Customer: Yeah exactly! So um, here's the thing, like my clients are all switching their payment schedules and um, I'm kind of in a weird spot?
223. I see, I see. So, um, what kind of changes are you, uh, thinking about? I mean, we have several options that might, um, work better for your situation.
Customer: Well so basically some pay me weekly now, some biweekly, it's like totally all over the place!
224. Right, that's, uh, that's actually pretty common with service businesses. Let me check what we can do here with your current plan under reference code REF-9981-MZ.
Customer: Wait so um, is this gonna mess up my whole account? Like I've been a customer for three years and uh, what if this makes everything complicated?
225. No no, it's going to be okay, really. Um, so what I can do is, uh, set up what we call a flexible billing option under plan FLX-2234-A, which basically lets you, um, adjust payment dates as needed.
Customer: Oh! So like, that's actually a thing you guys do?
226. Absolutely, yes. I think what would work best is, um, we put you on our variable schedule system VSS-7761-B, and then you can, uh, basically choose your billing date each month.
Customer: Okay but wait, um, what if I forget to pick a date? Like sometimes I get so busy with clients and uh, you know how it is...
227. That's totally understandable. So, um, the system will actually send you, uh, reminder emails five days before, and if you don't respond it just, um, defaults to your original date.
Customer: Oh that's actually perfect! So basically I'm not gonna get in trouble or anything?
228. Not at all, not at all. Let me just, um, make these changes now under modification code MOD-5547-K, and uh, you'll get a confirmation email within, I'd say, probably ten minutes or so.
Customer: You're like the best! So um, this starts right away or like next month or...?
229. So, uh, it'll take effect starting with your next billing cycle, which looks like, um, let me see here... that's gonna be the fifteenth. Reference number for this change is CHG-8823-VP.
Customer: Perfect! So basically I just email you guys whenever I need to switch it up?
230. Exactly right. Um, you can email, call, or actually use the app too. Your case number today is CSE-4419-TL if you need to, uh, reference this conversation later.
Customer: Um, hi, I need to get some, uh, documentation for a purchase I made?
231. Okay okay, so, um, I can definitely help with that, let me just—let me just pull up your account here and, uh, basically what we'll need is your order number or, um, the email address you used?
Customer: It's for my job—I'm a park ranger and the, um... the deadline is tomorrow.
232. Oh oh, right right, so so you need this for, um, for reimbursement, and—and I totally get that, like deadlines are, uh, they're they're really stressful, so let me see what information you have and we'll get this sorted quickly, do you have an order number?
Customer: I think—no wait, let me check—it should be... somewhere here...
233. No worries, um, take your time, or or if you have the, uh, the approximate date or even just, like, what the purchase was for, I can—I can search for it that way?
Customer: Um, it was, uh, GPS equipment? Like two weeks ago, maybe, um, the fifteenth?
234. Perfect perfect, so so I'm seeing, um, let me just—okay so there's an order here, ORD-4521-GPS, placed on October fifteenth for, uh, for a Garmin unit, total was $487.92, is—is that the one?
Customer: Yes! That's it. Are you sure you can get me the paperwork today?
235. So unfortunately—and and I really wish I had, um, better news here—the standard documentation usually takes, uh, takes like 24 to 48 hours to process through our system, which which I know doesn't help with your deadline...
Customer: Of course. Just... tell me what I need to do then.
236. But but wait, so, um, between you and me? I'm gonna—I'm gonna try something here, there's this, uh, this expedited receipt function we have for, like, corporate accounts, and technically technically park services might qualify?
Customer: Really? I mean, that would actually... is that allowed?
237. Okay okay, so so I've just, um, I've tagged your request as priority code PRI-889X and, uh, basically what I'm doing is—is routing it through our, like, our government services channel?
Customer: Um, okay, so how long will that—when would I actually get it?
238. So so with this—with this priority routing, you should, um, you should have the full documentation with receipt number RCP-4521-DOC in your email within, uh, within the next two hours, maybe maybe even sooner?
Customer: Two hours? Are you absolutely sure? Because if it doesn't come...
239. I—I totally understand your concern, and and honestly, um, I'm showing here that 95% of these priority requests process in under, uh, under an hour, so so you should be fine, but but just to be safe, I'm also adding my direct extension, it's 5847?
Customer: Okay, um, that's... what's the word... really above and beyond. Thank you.
240. No no, it's—it's my pleasure, and and honestly, like, park rangers do such important work, so, um, I've confirmed everything's submitted with tracking ID TRK-90021-RUSH, and uh, you should be all set for your deadline tomorrow!
Customer: Um, hi, I need to, uh, dispute a charge and I've been a customer for like eight years so...
241. Okay, um, let me just... hmm, pull up your account here. What's the, uh, phone number associated with the account so I can, um, get into the system and see what we're dealing with?
Customer: It's um, wait I have to whisper because the kids are napping but it's 555-0147 and this is just...
242. Got it, got it.
Customer: So there's this, uh, forty dollar charge that I never, um, authorized and honestly how do I know this isn't some kind of...
243. No no no, we're absolutely going to fix this. Um, so I'm looking at account ACT-7829-WK and, uh, let me see here... okay so there's a charge on October 15th for, hmm, premium services package PRE-4419X, is that what you're referring to?
Customer: Premium? I never signed up for any premium anything, this is exactly what I mean...
244. Right right.
Customer: Um, and like, every month it's something new, uh, first it was that data thing and now this and I just...
245. Okay so, um, I'm seeing a pattern here actually. Let me just, uh, dig deeper into transaction history TXN-88291-Q and, hmm, what if... oh! Oh wait, I see what happened! There was an, um, auto-enrollment trigger from promotion code PRM-6672 that, uh, shouldn't have activated on your account type.
Customer: Auto-enrollment? See this is, um, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes me think you're just trying to...
246. No no, um, listen, this is completely our mistake and, uh, I'm already processing the reversal. Reference number REF-3847-MNK for the full refund plus, hmm, let me see what else I can... okay so I'm also adding a courtesy credit of, um, another forty dollars for the inconvenience.
Customer: Wait you're actually, um, you're really fixing it? Because usually when I call it's just...
247. Absolutely.
Customer: Um, okay but like, how do I know this won't just, uh, happen again next month because I can't keep...
248. So, um, what I'm doing right now is, uh, putting a block code BLK-9901-AA on your account that, hmm, basically prevents any automatic enrollments or upgrades without, um, explicit verbal confirmation recorded on call ID CID-447829. Nobody can add anything without you personally approving it.
Customer: I mean I've been with you guys since 2016 and it's just, um, frustrating when these things keep...
249. Um, yeah no, I completely understand and, uh, looking at your account history... hmm, you really have been loyal and, um, actually! I just found something! You qualify for our, uh, loyalty rate adjustment program LRP-2024-B which would drop your base rate by, um, fifteen percent going forward.
Customer: Oh that's... um, I mean that would actually really help because with the daycare costs and everything...
250. Perfect! So, um, everything's been applied. Your confirmation is CNF-88412-PPX for the refund which, uh, should post in 3-5 business days, and the, hmm, the loyalty discount starts immediately on your next billing cycle. And um, like I said, nothing can be added without your explicit permission now, so you're, uh, totally protected going forward.
Customer: I just... I can't even... My package, it says—sorry, the tracking says delivered but I never...
251. Yeah, I've seen this one before. Got your account up? I can probably, um, track this down in about, uh, two seconds if you've got the order number handy.
Customer: Um, I don't—wait, I mean, yes, somewhere... God, I can't think straight...
252. No worries, no worries. I think I can, um, probably find it with just your, uh, email or phone. Whatever's easier.
Customer: It's just... everything's been going wrong and now this... I needed that package.
253. I hear ya. So, um, lemme just, uh, pull up your recent orders here and—okay okay, seeing three from last week. Was it the one ending in, um, I think ORD-9482-XL?
Customer: No that's—sorry, that's not it. The other—I mean, Tuesday's order. Or was it Monday?
254. Got it got it. That'd be, um, ORD-9477-PK then, placed Monday at, uh, 3:47 PM. Shows delivered yesterday at 2:15. Front porch.
Customer: There's nothing there! I checked everywhere, the back—no wait, I mean the side gate, the bushes...
255. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and I've, uh, I've done this probably a hundred times so, um, we'll get this sorted. First lemme check if maybe the driver marked the wrong, uh, the wrong delivery.
Customer: Oh god, um, what if someone stole it? I can't afford to—sorry, I mean, can you just send another one?
256. So, uh, looking at the GPS ping from delivery and it's, hmm, it's showing about, um, forty feet from your address. Might've gone to a neighbor?
Customer: Wait, forty feet? That's... oh my god, that would be the Johnsons. No—sorry, the other side. The Nguyens. They're away and I'm just... I'm so tired of everything being complicated.
257. I think we're, um, onto something here. So so so, lemme just, uh, double-check the photo they took—yeah, blue door. Yours blue?
Customer: Red. It's red. Of course it's the wrong... I just, I'm sorry, I'm not usually like this but it's my mom's medication and I've been dealing with insurance all week and now this and I just can't stop talking, sorry, nervous habit when things go wrong...
258. Hey hey, no no no, totally get it. So, um, lemme just—I'm gonna, uh, mark this as misdelivered right now, reference number MSD-7739-QT22, and I think we can probably get a replacement out, um, today even.
Customer: Today? Really? Oh god, thank you, I just... wait, you can do that? Even though it's—I mean, it's already Thursday afternoon...
259. Um, well, I maybe shouldn't promise but, uh, but but since it's medication, I'm gonna, um, tag it priority with code, uh, URGENT-MED-8847. Should should ship within the hour.
Customer: I'm sorry I'm such a mess, it's just been... you know when everything piles up? And then your package disappears and it's like the universe is—sorry, I'm rambling again, I do that when I'm stressed, my therapist says it's a coping mechanism and oh god I'm doing it right now aren't I?
260. You're you're totally fine, really. Um, so just to, uh, double-check everything here—new package ships today, tracking'll be, um, TRK-9477-PK-R2, and I maybe put a note for the driver about the red door? Just to, you know, make sure?
Customer: I'm... prob'ly just. Did somethin' wrong. But my autopay? It didn't... go through.
261. Oh! Let me pull that up for you—I love solving these autopay mysteries! What's your account number? Should be something like ACC followed by some digits.
Customer: It's uh. Sorry. I'm so bad at this. ACC... 4521... B?
262. ACC-4521-B, perfect! Okay, I'm seeing the attempted payment here from the 15th... OH! I think I found our culprit! Your card ending in 3847?
Customer: Yeah that's... that's the one. Did I mess up the...
263. No no no, you did everything right! The bank declined it with code ERR-2745-INSUFF. Basically, it tried to process at 3:47 AM and there probably wasn't quite enough available balance at that exact moment.
Customer: Oh god. I'm so... This is for my mom's... her oxygen supplier. They need...
264. Oh wow, okay, that's definitely important. Let me see what I can—actually, hold on, I think I can manually retry this right now with override code OVR-9923-X.
Customer: You can? I just. I moved money but. Wasn't fast enough and...
265. Already on it! The system's kind of fighting me here but—YES! Got it! Transaction TXN-8847-ZK is processing now. Should clear in maybe two minutes?
Customer: Really? I thought. Once it fails it's just...
266. Usually, yeah, but medical suppliers get special handling protocols under policy MED-7736-A. I can basically force it through as long as the funds are there now.
Customer: They are. I mean. Should be? Unless I...
267. Let me just... checking... YEP! Payment confirmed! Reference number REF-3928-KL for your records. It went through at $247.50.
Customer: Oh thank god. Thank you. I was so scared they'd... cut her off or...
268. Totally understand. Actually, I think we should probably set up a backup payment method under your profile ID PRF-4521-B-SEC, just in case?
Customer: Yeah. Yes. That's... smart. I should've...
269. Hey, these things happen! The backup system code BCK-1147 will try your secondary card if the primary fails. Want me to set that up now?
Customer: Please? If you... if that's not too much...
270. Already adding it! Your backup is now active under confirmation CNF-9984-PP. Next autopay on the 15th will try your main card first, then backup if needed. Crisis officially averted!
Customer: Um, hi, so I'm calling about, uh, these charges that are, er, they're not matching up with our POs?
271. So, um, I can definitely help you with that, let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can you give me your, like, account number or maybe a purchase order number so I can, um, see what's going on?
Customer: It's um, wait, which one do you need, because I have like three different POs here and they're all wrong!
272. Okay okay, so basically let's start with, um, any one of them—I mean, whichever one you have handy—and I can pull up your whole account from there, probably see all the recent transactions.
Customer: PO-7742, no wait, uh, PO-7742-B, and it's supposed to be $3,200 but you charged us $4,100!
273. Alright so, um, I'm looking at PO-7742-B here and, uh, I can see the discrepancy. So basically what happened is, like, there's an additional line item with code INV-8829-QX that got, um, added after the initial purchase order was processed.
Customer: But that's, um, that's not how this works, we can't just, er, have random charges appearing!
274. No no, you're absolutely right, and I'm, uh, really sorry about this confusion. So let me dig deeper here—it looks like, um, someone on our end marked it as an automatic replenishment but your account settings show, like, manual approval only.
Customer: Um, exactly! And there's more, like, the drill bits order from last week is, uh, showing twice?
275. So I see that—order ORD-5543-MN91, right? Yeah so, um, this is definitely not—I mean, this shouldn't have happened. Let me, uh, basically check if this was a system error or if someone manually, like, duplicated it somehow.
Customer: This is, um, such a mess, I have to report all this to accounting and they're gonna, er, totally freak out.
276. Got it.
Customer: Can you, like, fix all of these today? Because um, our audit is... what's the word... it's imminent!
277. So here's what I can do—and I'm, um, kind of limited by our system but—I can issue immediate credits for the duplicate charge, that's credit number CRD-9901-LP22, but the, uh, the other discrepancy needs supervisor approval.
Customer: Oh um, okay that's, er, that's actually really helpful, thank you so much for finding that!
278. So basically I'm putting in the request now, and, um, normally it takes 24-48 hours but I'm marking it as urgent with reference number URG-3356-KT because, like, I can see you have multiple issues here that need fixing.
Customer: You're being so, um, helpful, I really appreciate you actually listening instead of just, er, brushing me off!
279. I mean, I've been doing this job long enough to know how, uh, frustrating these billing issues can be. So let me also, um, add a note here about your audit deadline—when exactly is that?
Customer: Um, it's Friday, so like, three days, which is why I'm kinda, uh, panicking here!
280. Okay so, um, I'm escalating this with priority flag PRI-7765-XX and basically, uh, I wish I could guarantee it'll be resolved by then, but realistically our billing department is, like, pretty backed up. But I've documented everything with case number CSE-20489-BN44 so you have, um, proof that these discrepancies were reported before your audit.
Customer: Yeah so my my blender broke. Warranty expired last week.
281. Oh, um, I'm really sorry to hear that. So let me just—actually wait, let me, uh, pull up your account here first. Can you give me your, um, your order number or the email you used?
Customer: It's it's on the box somewhere. Hold on hold on.
282. No rush at all. While you're looking, I can also, uh, search by your phone number if that's... what's the word... more convenient? So basically, um, I just need any way to find your account in the system here.
Customer: Um, okay so it's, uh, james dot carter at gmail. That's that's the email.
283. Perfect, perfect. So I'm seeing here... okay so your account ACC-45821-J shows you purchased the, um, the ProBlend 5000 on October 15th last year, and that would make your warranty expiration date, uh, let me just calculate... October 15th this year, which was, hmm, exactly eight days ago.
Customer: Eight days. Of course of course it's eight days.
284. Yeah, I know, the timing is really—let me just—actually, um, before we go further, can you tell me what exactly happened with it? Like, uh, what's the... what's the specific issue you're experiencing?
Customer: Um, it just, uh, won't turn on anymore. Nothing. Dead dead dead.
285. Okay so, um, I want to walk you through a couple things here, and, uh, between you and me? Your warranty expired on the 15th with reference number WAR-2023-10-88745, but, hmm, there's something called a... what's it called... a grace period that, um, not everyone knows about.
Customer: Grace period? How do I know—wait, how do I know this isn't just some some trick?
286. No no, totally fair question. So let me explain—actually, uh, let me start over. In your warranty document, um, if you look at section 7.2 under code GRACE-EXT-30, it basically says that for, uh, for failures within thirty days of expiration, we can... hmm, we can review for what they call "catastrophic failure exceptions."
Customer: I don't—I mean I don't have that paper anymore. Threw it out probably.
287. That's fine, that's totally fine. So, um, here's what I'm seeing in your case file CSE-99412-BRK. The ProBlend 5000 has had some, uh, some known issues with the... what's the term... the motor controller board? And between you and me, um, we've been approving most of these even past warranty.
Customer: Um, so you're you're saying you might actually replace it?
288. Well, so, uh, I need to—let me just—I need to submit this for review first. But, um, based on what I'm seeing with failure code FLC-MOTOR-500 in our system, and the fact that it's only, uh, eight days past? I'd say you have a really, hmm, a really good chance here.
Customer: Okay okay, so what what do I need to do then?
289. Right, so, um, super simple actually. I'm going to, uh, create a case number for you right now—that's going to be, hmm, let me generate this... CAS-2024-78823-JC. And then you'll just need to, um, to take a photo of the serial number on the bottom and, uh, email that to our claims department.
Customer: Serial number, bottom, got it got it. And then and then what?
290. So once they get that, um, and this is the good part, since I'm putting a note here with, uh, with exception code EXC-GRACE-APPROVED-PENDING, they should basically just, hmm, rubber stamp it. You'll hear back in like, um, two to three business days, and then we'll ship you a replacement unit with tracking number starting with TRK.
Customer: Um, I need to... what's the word... escalate this. My medication. It's, uh, it's not here and I'm almost out.
291. Oh no, I completely get it—my mom's diabetic so I know how scary that is when meds run low. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your order number?
Customer: It's, um... hold on... ORD-4472-BN. I've been a customer for, uh, six years. This is... what do you call it... unacceptable.
292. Got that, um, ORD-4472-BN and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that it's... oh. Okay so, um, there's a delay and I'm really, really sorry about this...
Customer: A delay? I have two pills left. Two.
293. I know, I know, this is, um, this is awful and I'm just... let me check the tracking, it's showing, uh, package ID PKG-77293-XM is stuck at the distribution center since...
Customer: Since when? This is, um... how do I put this... life or death. Not, uh, not some random package.
294. Right right.
Customer: I mean, um, I've never missed a payment. Ever. And now you're, uh, telling me... what exactly?
295. So, um, honestly? I'm gonna level with you here—the system shows it's been sitting there for, uh, three days, tracking number TRK-882916-L, and that's just... I mean, that shouldn't happen...
Customer: Three days. While I'm rationing medication.
296. Listen, I'm, um, I'm putting in an emergency override right now, reference number REF-9982-QK12, and, uh, calling the distribution center directly which I don't usually...
Customer: You can do that? Will it... will it actually help?
297. Between you and me? I used to work dispatch before this, so I know exactly who to call. Your prescription RX-4419-MED is getting flagged for same-day courier service.
Customer: Um, same-day? Like... today? You're, uh, you're sure about that?
298. Absolutely. Confirmation code CNF-20847-A will pop up in your email, should be there within four hours, five max.
Customer: I... okay. That would work. That would actually work.
299. And hey, um, I'm also adding a credit, code CRD-445-RUSH, for the, uh, for the whole mess, because this just... this never should've...
Customer: Thank you. Really. I was starting to think nobody there understood.
300. No no, I get it completely. Keep that reference number REF-9982-QK12 just in case, but you should be all set by this afternoon.
Customer: Um, hi. I just... uh, need help with my bill. It's, um. Higher than usual?
301. Okay okay. Let me—let me pull that up. Account number or—wait, sorry, phone number works too...
Customer: Er, it's just. My hours got cut. At work. Um. Really need to understand this.
302. Got it. Right right. So I'm seeing account... hold on... ACC-7829-BK12 here. December statement. It's it's showing... give me a sec...
Customer: Um, there's these charges? I don't. Uh. Don't recognize them.
303. Mm-hmm. Looking. Looking. So there's—okay, three main sections on your bill TXN-4482-XJ. Base service. Add-ons. And then...
Customer: My kid's, um, medical bills are. Er. Already so much. Need every dollar.
304. I understand. Really. Let me—let me break this down item by item. First charge REF-9921-LP is your standard monthly. That's that's always thirty-nine ninety-nine.
Customer: Okay. Um. That one's normal. What about. Uh. The fifty dollar one?
305. Right. So um, that's—hold on, that's the... no wait, sorry, I mean the premium upgrade from November twentieth. Code UPG-6634-TT22. You added the the sports package...
Customer: Sports? But I. Um. I canceled that. Er, weeks ago.
306. Let me just... checking... checking the notes here... Oh. Oh okay okay. I see it. You canceled on the twenty-eighth but the the billing cycle already... it doesn't prorate mid-cycle, so...
Customer: Wait, really? So I'm. Uh. Paying for something I don't have?
307. Unfortunately that's—that's how the system... But. But but but. Let me check something else. Reference CRD-3847-MN91. There might be...
Customer: Um, I just. Can't afford extra charges. Single mom. Er. You know?
308. Found something. So so so, there's a loyalty credit I can—I can apply. Twenty-five dollars. Credit code CMP-7722-QR. Not the full amount but... it's something...
Customer: Really? Oh! Um. That's. Uh, that would help! Really?
309. Already processing. Should show as credit line CRD-8837-PP within... hmm, within two days. Also also, for next month? I'm noting here to prevent any overlap charges...
Customer: I didn't expect. Um. This is great! Er, thank you. Really.
310. Welcome. Really. And um, just so you know, reference this call ID CLL-9983-KM42 if you need anything else. The credit's guaranteed. Already in the system...
Customer: I need to—I need to cancel this this trial thing. Before you charge me.
311. Got it. So um, let me just, er, pull up your account here and... if you could give me the email you signed up with?
Customer: It's it's um, jason.martinez at gmail. I just—I just don't want to get charged okay?
312. Right. Yep. So I've got your account here, JMZ-847392-T, and um, I can see you're on day twelve of the fourteen-day trial so... actually you've still got two days but let me just... process this cancellation right now.
Customer: Um okay okay, so like, you're you're actually helping me? I thought this would be—be harder.
313. Course. So um, here's the thing though, er, once I cancel this—and I will—you lose access immediately. Not in two days. Right now. If that's... I mean if you're okay with that then...
Customer: Oh. Oh I didn't—didn't know that part.
314. Mmm hmm. Yep. So, um, what some folks do is, er, set a reminder for like day thirteen? Then cancel? That way you get the full trial and... but I mean if you want me to just do it now I can.
Customer: Um that's that's actually... you're being really helpful here. I'm sorry if I sounded—sounded angry before.
315. No no. Listen. Um, I get it. These trials can be, er, tricky and... look let me do something here. Setting you an automatic cancel for end of day thirteen. Order CAC-9847-XR22.
Customer: Wait you can—you can do that? That's that's perfect actually.
316. Yep. So um, basically what happens is, er, the system will process cancellation at 11:59 PM on your thirteenth day and... you won't see any charges. Ever. Your confirmation is CAN-482759-B.
Customer: I just—I just really appreciate this, um, I've been so stressed about forgetting and and getting charged.
317. Right right. So, um, I'm also gonna, er, make sure you get an email reminder. Tomorrow. Day before cancel. Just so you know it's happening and... basically triple protection here.
Customer: Um you know what, maybe maybe I'll actually keep it if if it's good?
318. Sure. Yep. So here's what's nice—you can, um, log into your account dashboard with code DSH-7749-L and, er, just toggle off the auto-cancel if you decide to stay... super easy.
Customer: This is—this is way easier than I thought, um, thank you so so much.
319. Course. And um, just so you're protected going forward? I'm adding note NTE-558241-P to your account that you contacted us about this so, er, if anything weird happens we have the record and...
Customer: I'm I'm actually impressed. Really. Thank you.
320. Good good. Yep. So um, you're all set with auto-cancel on day thirteen, confirmation CAN-482759-B again and, er, just remember you can change your mind anytime before then if... yeah. We're good here.
Customer: Um, I think there was... probably an issue with my, uh, payment? It sort of... bounced, I guess...
321. Oh! Okay so, um, let me just pull that up here and, hmm, yeah I can see your account number ACC-7739-BC here and, uh, looks like the payment from November 15th did bounce back, but um, we can totally fix this right now!
Customer: I'm just... really tired of this happening...
322. So basically what I'm seeing is, like, your payment reference PTR-883924 tried to process but, um, the bank code came back as NSF-44, which means, uh, insufficient funds at the time, but honestly these things happen all the time and we can just, you know, rerun it whenever works for you.
Customer: Maybe we could, um, try it again? If that's... I mean, if that makes sense...
323. Absolutely! So, um, here's what I can do—let me just, uh, clear out that failed transaction TXN-299847-F first and, hmm, okay so then we can set up a new one, and actually, um, I can even waive that bounced payment fee of $35 because, like, you've been with us for... wow, three years!
Customer: Um, that would be, uh... I mean, thank you. That's kind of you to...
324. Oh! And, um, I just noticed something interesting here—so your account ACC-7739-BC shows you're on our, uh, business plan for carpet cleaning services, right? And like, I can actually switch you to invoice billing with NET-30 terms if that's, um, if that would help with cash flow?
Customer: I don't know, I'm just... my truck broke down last week and then...
325. Right right.
Customer: And um, the medical bills from, uh, from my wife's surgery are just... they're sort of piling up...
326. Yeah, I mean, I totally get it, like, everything hits at once, right? So, um, what if we do this—I can split your payment into two smaller ones, um, reference codes PMT-8847-A and PMT-8847-B, and then, uh, basically spread them out over the month so it's not, you know, one big hit to your account all at once?
Customer: That might, um... that might work better, I think... probably...
327. Perfect! So, hmm, let me just set that up here and, um, okay so the first payment of $127.50 would process, uh, tomorrow with confirmation CFM-772634, and then the second one, um, on December 1st—does that timeline work?
Customer: Um, yeah, I mean, as long as it doesn't... you know, bounce again...
328. Oh! Actually, um, here's something cool—I can set up, like, a backup payment method on file, so basically if the first one fails for whatever reason, it'll, uh, automatically try the backup instead of just, you know, bouncing and causing all these fees.
Customer: I don't really, uh... I mean, I only have the one account right now...
329. Gotcha.
Customer: Maybe just, um, the split payments would be... that's probably enough for now, I think...
330. Yeah no, totally makes sense! So, um, I've got everything set up here with your reference number REF-9928-CCS, and like, I also added a note to your account that, uh, basically says to call you first if there's any payment issues instead of just, you know, letting it bounce, because honestly our system can be, hmm, a bit ridiculous sometimes with how it handles these things.
Customer: So I just need some kind of letter saying my account's good.
331. Oh! Um, okay so—let me just—actually I need to, uh, pull up your account first. Can I get your account number or, um, the phone number associated with it?
Customer: Ummm, I think it's under, uh, this number.
332. Got it got it.
Customer: Is this gonna take long? I basically just need the paperwork.
333. No no, so um, I'm just—sorry, the system's being—okay there we go, account ACC-9847-PZ. So, uh, you need documentation that it's in good standing, and um, I'm really sorry but there's actually, er, there's a specific form for that?
Customer: Of course there is.
334. I know, I know—it's—look, um, between you and me? The form is ridiculous. But, uh, basically I can generate it right now if you've got, like, five minutes? Your reference number will be, um, REF-224789-B and it'll show, er, payment history and everything.
Customer: Yeah, um, whatever you need to do. I know this isn't, like, your fault or anything.
335. Oh that's—thank you for saying that. So, um, okay I'm filling out the, uh, the request here. Is this for, er, like a rental application or—wait, sorry, I shouldn't—that's not really—
Customer: Mortgage actually. So, um, yeah.
336. Oh congrats! That's—okay so for mortgage they usually want, um, twelve months of history, and uh, looking at your account ACC-9847-PZ here, you've been, er, perfect for—wow—three years, not a single late payment.
Customer: Ummm, yeah, I just, uh, I try to keep things, you know, simple.
337. Right right.
Customer: Can you just email it or...?
338. So here's the thing—and um, this is where it gets, er, kind of annoying—the system generates a PDF with verification code VER-8832-QM41, but uh, it has to mail it? Like physically mail it? Which is—I mean—it's 2024, right?
Customer: You're kidding. I need this by Friday.
339. Okay okay, so—don't panic—I'm gonna, um, do something here. There's a—let me just—there's an expedited option under code EXP-7741 that, uh, basically I can mark it as "urgent financial documentation" and then, er, you'll get an email within an hour?
Customer: That would be, um, that would actually be really helpful. Thanks for, like, working with me here.
340. No no, totally get it! The, um, the email will come from noreply at our domain, reference REF-224789-B, and uh, if the mortgage company needs anything else, just—actually here, I'll put a note on account ACC-9847-PZ that we verified everything today, November 15th. Should be, er, should be all set!
Customer: Oh great great, another person who's gonna—gonna tell me they fixed it, right?
341. Um, okay so. Let me just, uh. Pull up your account here and—hmm, what's your email?
Customer: It's it's the one getting all the spam I unsubscribed from three times already.
342. Right right. Um, so here's the thing—uh, between you and me? Our unsubscribe system code USX-4421-B has been, um. Acting up. But I know a workaround that, uh, technically I'm not supposed to use.
Customer: Ummm let me guess, you're—you're gonna put me on some, uh, special list that totally works this time?
343. Got it.
Customer: That's what the last person said said and here we are.
344. No no, um, this is different. So what I'm gonna do—uh, lemme think here—I'm putting you in our priority block list PBL-7792-XK. It's, um. The one we use for executives. Don't tell anyone I did this.
Customer: Uh huh, and and this magical executive list actually, um, works?
345. Absolutely.
Customer: Because I've—I've clicked unsubscribe so many times I could do it in my sleep.
346. Um, yeah so. Here's what happened. Your email got stuck in, uh, in queue QID-5581-MX9. The regular unsubscribe? It's, um, taking like 30 days. But this thing I'm doing now? Instant.
Customer: Thirty thirty days?! Are you—um, are you serious right now?
347. Right? It's. Um, it's ridiculous. So anyway, uh, I'm just gonna—hmm, okay so I'm marking your case CSE-9904-TJ as escalated and, um, basically overriding the whole system here.
Customer: I mean I'll—I'll believe it when the emails actually, uh, stop coming.
348. Fair. Totally fair. Um, so like, check your inbox tomorrow? Should be, uh. Clean. And if not—which won't happen but—um, reference number REF-2261-QP8 gets you straight to, uh, to me.
Customer: Wait wait you're—you're saying it'll actually work by tomorrow?
349. Yep yep.
Customer: Um okay so if—if this doesn't work I'm just, uh, gonna forward every spam email to you personally.
350. Ha! Um, honestly? Do it. But, uh, but trust me here—your confirmation XFM-8823-LK just went through and, um. You're golden. Those emails? Gone. Like they never existed.
Character 1: Oh god, I've been thinking about therapy but I'm— I'm completely freaking out about it!
351. Hey, breathe! It's actually totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, you know, because opening up to someone new is scary, but therapists are trained to make you feel safe and comfortable from the very first moment.
Character 1: But I— I um, don't even know if I can like, form coherent sentences when I'm there, I'll probably just sort of ramble nonsensically!
352. Well, that's perfectly fine, I mean, therapists are used to people being nervous! They'll basically help guide you through everything, ask gentle questions, and there's no wrong way to express yourself in that space.
Character 1: What if I— uh, what if I pick the wrong therapist and er, waste all my money? I guess that terrifies me!
353. Most therapists offer brief consultations where you can get a feel for their style, and many will work with you on payment plans or sliding scales if cost is a concern.
Character 1: I keep— so, I keep imagining myself just honestly crying uncontrollably and kind of making a complete fool of myself!
354. Hmm, here's the thing though, crying in therapy is really one of the most normal things ever! The thing is, therapists see it as healthy emotional processing, not embarrassing at all, and they're completely prepared for it.
Character 1: Oh god, but uhh, what if my problems are stupid? I mean, what if they think I'm being dramatic over nothing?
355. Right so, no therapist worth their salt would ever think that, actually! If something's bothering you enough to seek help, you know, then it's valid and deserves attention, no matter how "small" it might seem.
Character 1: I can't even make phone calls without panicking— how am I supposed to schedule an appointment?!
356. Well, many therapists honestly accept online booking now, like through their websites or apps! You can schedule without talking to anyone, and some even offer text or email communication for anxious clients.
Character 1: What if I start and then chicken out after one session?
357. That's your choice and it's [formal] completely within your rights to stop whenever you feel necessary! Therapists understand that timing matters and they won't take it personally if you need to pause or stop.
Character 1: But everyone will know I'm broken if I go to therapy!
358. Um, first off, therapy is [overly polite] extremely confidential, so nobody has to know unless you choose to tell them, you know? And sort of more importantly, going to therapy means you're taking care of yourself, not that you're broken.
Character 1: I just— I feel like such a mess even considering this!
359. Oh, I'm so [apologetic] sorry you're feeling this way, but uh, can I tell you something? I mean, the fact that you're even considering getting help basically shows incredible self-awareness and strength.
Character 1: So you really think— like, you think I should just er, bite the bullet and do it even though I'm terrified?
360. Actually, yes, because that fear you're feeling, well, it's just your brain trying to protect you from the unknown, but kind of ironically, therapy is exactly where you learn to handle fears like this!
Character 1: Working from home is driving me absolutely insane!
361. Oh no, well, what's been the, um, [friendly] biggest challenge for you? I mean, the transition can be rough, especially when you're used to, you know, having that physical separation between work and home life.
Character 1: I just— uh, I can't stop working! Like, my laptop's right there and I'm, er, constantly checking emails at midnight!
362. Mmm, that's so common, honestly! The thing is, without those physical boundaries, your brain basically never switches off, and you kind of end up in this perpetual work mode that's, well, exhausting.
Character 1: And I, umm, [very sad] miss people so much! You know, I haven't had a real conversation with a coworker in, like, weeks except through, I guess, these stupid video calls!
363. Actually, that isolation is, uh, [very quietly] one of the hardest parts that nobody really talks about enough. I mean, we're social creatures, and those water cooler chats, err, they matter more than we realized, don't they?
Character 1: Yes! Exactly! And my cat, hmm, [happy] thinks every video call is for her! She's basically become my, you know, unofficial coworker at this point!
364. Haha, okay so, pets becoming coworkers is like, the most relatable thing ever! Mine, well, my dog has crashed so many meetings that my team just, uhh, expects him to make an appearance now.
Character 1: Do you, um, ever feel like you're losing your mind? Sort of talking to yourself all day, I mean, because there's nobody else around?
365. Oh absolutely, the thing is, I've had full conversations with my houseplants! Actually, sometimes I narrate what I'm doing just to, you know, hear a human voice even if it's, er, my own.
Character 1: And don't even get me started on wearing pajama pants to meetings!
366. Right? The whole "business on top, comfort on bottom" situation has become this universal secret that everyone knows but nobody acknowledges on calls!
Character 1: I, uhh, tried setting up a proper office space but honestly, I still end up working from bed half the time anyway!
367. Mmm, here's the thing though, your brain needs those location cues, you know? But I get it, sometimes the bed just, well, calls to you, especially when it's cold and your heating bill is already ridiculous!
Character 1: My back is killing me from this terrible desk setup!
368. Ooh, investing in a good chair changed my life, seriously! It seems expensive at first but when you calculate the chiropractor visits you're preventing, it actually pays for itself pretty quickly.
Character 1: How do you, like, actually stop working at the end of the day? I mean, there's no commute to, sort of, decompress anymore!
369. So I've started doing this fake commute thing where I, um, [apologetic] walk around the block before and after work? It sounds ridiculous, but it actually helps signal to my brain that work is starting or ending, even though I'm just coming back to the same place!
Character 1: That's— hmm, that's actually brilliant! Do you, er, ever feel guilty though, like when you take breaks during the day?
370. All the time, honestly! But here's the thing, we need to remember that in an office we weren't productive for eight hours straight either, you know? We had coffee breaks, chatted with people, basically took mental breaks constantly, so it's actually normal and healthy!
Character 1: So, um, I've decided that working from home is, like, [joking] living in a time loop where every day is basically Tuesday and my couch is my, er, prison warden!
371. Haha, that's, you know, [curious] such a specific way to put it! Why Tuesday though? I mean, is there something particularly soul-crushing about, um, Tuesdays in your home office experience?
Character 1: Because, well, Monday has hope and Wednesday is, uhh, [deep pitch] halfway there, but Tuesday? Actually, Tuesday is just... the void, you know?
372. That's weirdly profound! I never thought about the existential weight of different weekdays when you're stuck in the same space twenty-four seven.
Character 1: I've named all my furniture. The desk is Gerald.
373. Gerald! That's amazing! Does Gerald have a personality, or is he just a silent witness to your daily work struggles?
Character 1: Oh, Gerald judges me, honestly. Like, every time I, um, eat lunch at my desk, I can feel his, err, disappointment radiating through the wood grain, you know?
374. I, well, totally get that! My kitchen table has become my office and, [cough], it definitely wasn't, uhh, designed for this kind of, actually, emotional burden!
Character 1: Yesterday I, hmm, realized I was having full conversations with my reflection in the, like, black screen during loading times. Is that, sort of, concerning?
375. Honestly, that's more common than you'd think! I mean, the isolation makes us, um, find companionship in the strangest places, and actually, your reflection is at least, well, a familiar face!
Character 1: My plants have, you know, developed personalities too. The succulent is, er, passive-aggressive and the fern is basically an overachiever.
376. Right so, anthropomorphizing our surroundings is, uhh, basically a coping mechanism! The thing is, we need that social interaction, and our brains will, sort of, create it wherever possible.
Character 1: I've started wearing different hats for different meetings to feel like I'm actually going places.
377. That's, um, [warm] actually brilliant! You know, creating those little rituals and, well, visual cues can really help your brain compartmentalize different parts of your day, honestly.
Character 1: The mailman thinks I'm insane because I wave at him like he's a celebrity every single day.
378. He's probably the highlight of many people's days right now! Human contact, even from six feet away through a window, has become this precious commodity.
Character 1: Do you, like, ever forget how to, umm, interact with actual humans? I mean, when you finally do see people in person?
379. Oh god yes! So, last week I went to the grocery store and, err, accidentally narrated my shopping list out loud because I'd gotten so used to, you know, talking to myself at home!
Character 1: I've created an elaborate [frustrated] fantasy where my ceiling fan is plotting against me because it knows all my secrets.
380. Haha, well, the paranoia is real! I guess when you're alone with your thoughts all day, um, even inanimate objects start to feel like they're, [sniffle], actually, part of some grand conspiracy against your sanity!
Character 1: So, I've been thinking about this pattern where people, you know, seem to create these elaborate internal narratives around their daily routines, and um, it's fascinating how we construct meaning from repetition.
381. Well, that's such an interesting observation! I mean, when you think about it, humans are naturally storytelling creatures, and we need to actually make sense of our experiences even when they're monotonous or isolated.
Character 1: Honestly, there's this psychological framework that suggests we're, like, constantly trying to impose order on chaos, and err, the home office environment amplifies this tendency exponentially.
382. The thing is, you're absolutely right about that amplification effect! Our brains are, uh, wired to find patterns and create narratives, and basically when we're stuck in the same environment, that tendency goes into overdrive.
Character 1: I've been documenting how my own perception of time has shifted since working from home started, and the data is genuinely disturbing.
383. Oh, that sounds like a really valuable self-study! Time perception distortion is such a common phenomenon in isolation, and having actual documented evidence of your own experience must be revealing some interesting patterns.
Character 1: Hmm, what I've noticed is that there's this, sort of, elastic quality to hours now where some stretch infinitely while others vanish, and it's just that the traditional markers of time have completely dissolved.
384. That's [gasp softly] exactly what so many people are experiencing! The absence of commutes, different physical spaces for different activities, and regular social cues has completely dismantled our internal clocks.
Character 1: The neurological implications are fascinating because our circadian rhythms depend on these external cues that we've systematically removed from our lives.
385. Absolutely, and what's really interesting is how quickly our brains adapt to this new reality, even though the adaptation itself might not be particularly healthy or sustainable in the long term.
Character 1: Okay so, I've been tracking my productivity metrics and they show this, kind of, bizarre pattern where my most creative moments happen during what would traditionally be, uhh, considered completely inappropriate work hours.
386. Right so, that's actually a phenomenon that, you know, a lot of remote workers are discovering! Without the constraints of office hours, I guess our natural creative rhythms can finally express themselves freely.
Character 1: Anyway, the social isolation aspect creates this really interesting paradox where we're, umm, simultaneously more connected digitally but profoundly disconnected physically.
387. Ah, that paradox is, well, one of the defining features of this era! We're having more virtual interactions than ever before, but honestly, the quality and depth of those connections often feels somehow diminished.
Character 1: So, my analysis of communication patterns shows that we're, like, [chuckle] developing entirely new social protocols for digital interaction that would seem actually bizarre in traditional contexts.
388. That evolution of digital etiquette is fascinating to watch in real-time! We're literally witnessing the birth of new social norms and communication styles that didn't exist even two years ago.
Character 1: Er, do you think we're basically witnessing a fundamental shift in human social behavior, or is this, I mean, just a temporary adaptation?
389. That's the million-dollar question! I think we're [whispering] seeing some changes that will definitely stick around, but others will probably fade once we return to more normal interaction patterns.
Character 1: I've been analyzing my own behavioral changes and, um, the data suggests that I've developed, you know, [regretful] compensatory mechanisms that might be sort of maladaptive in normal social contexts.
390. Hmmm, that self-awareness is really important though! The thing is, recognizing these adaptations means you can consciously work to maintain flexibility, and really, we're all going through this unprecedented social experiment together.
Character 1: So my boss just [cough] terminated three people yesterday without any written warnings or documentation whatsoever.
391. Oh wow, that's, um, really concerning from a legal standpoint! I mean, depending on your state's employment laws, that could actually open the company up to, you know, some serious wrongful termination claims.
Character 1: Well, the thing is, we're supposedly an at-will state, but like, I heard one of them was, er, about to file a discrimination complaint.
392. That changes everything completely! If someone gets fired right before filing a discrimination complaint, that looks incredibly suspicious and could be considered retaliation, which is illegal even in at-will states.
Character 1: Honestly, our HR department is, uhh, basically non-existent, just one person who, I guess, mostly handles payroll and benefits.
393. So, that's a huge red flag because, you know, proper HR procedures are, hmm, essential for protecting both employees and the company! Without documentation or progressive discipline policies, the company is basically, well, asking for legal trouble.
Character 1: They didn't even give them time to clean out their desks, just escorted them out immediately.
394. That immediate escort practice is [clearing throat] sometimes standard for security reasons, but it needs to be applied consistently. If they only do it to certain employees, that could suggest discriminatory treatment.
Character 1: One of them had just returned from maternity leave two weeks ago.
395. Oh no, that's, um, [whispering] potentially a pregnancy discrimination case right there! Terminating someone shortly after maternity leave, I mean, without documented performance issues, that's exactly the kind of, err, pattern that employment lawyers look for.
Character 1: Actually, I've been, like, [cough] documenting everything because, you know, I'm worried I might be next since I, uhh, questioned the overtime policy last month.
396. Smart move documenting everything! Keep copies of all emails, take notes with dates and times, and if possible, back everything up somewhere outside the company's systems.
Character 1: Is it legal for me to record conversations with my manager without telling him?
397. That depends entirely on your state's recording laws! Some states are one-party consent states where you can record if you're part of the conversation, but others require all parties to consent.
Character 1: The whole environment has become so toxic that people are afraid to take their vacation days.
398. Well, that culture of fear is, sort of, unfortunately common but, you know, it's also evidence of a hostile work environment! The thing is, when employees can demonstrate that, um, legitimate benefits are being discouraged, that's another potential legal issue.
Character 1: I found out they're planning to [crying while speaking] eliminate my entire department next quarter but they're still hiring us for long-term projects.
399. That's potentially fraudulent misrepresentation! If they're knowingly hiring people or assigning long-term work while planning layoffs, employees might have claims for detrimental reliance or even fraud.
Character 1: Should I consult with an [formal] employment attorney before they make any moves against me?
400. Absolutely, yes, and actually, the sooner the better! Most employment attorneys offer, hmm, free consultations, and they can, you know, help you understand your rights and, basically, what evidence you should be gathering right now.
Character 1: So, um, here's the thing - why do we, like, say "heads up" when we actually duck?
401. Oh, I mean, that's actually one of those beautiful linguistic contradictions we've inherited, you know? It originally meant to literally raise your head to be alert, but somewhere along the centuries it morphed into a warning that often makes us duck instead.
Character 1: But that's completely backwards.
402. Right? Language evolution is wonderfully illogical sometimes. It's like how we park in driveways and drive on parkways, or how "cleave" can mean both to split apart and to stick together.
Character 1: Wait, cleave means both?
403. Absolutely! It's called a contronym or auto-antonym - a word that's its own opposite. English has dozens of them, like "dust" which can mean to add fine particles or remove them.
Character 1: That's [deep pitch] insane. How do we even communicate?
404. Well, context is, uhh, everything really - our brains are, I guess, remarkably good at disambiguating based on surrounding words and situations.
Character 1: You're just making this [condescending] up now, aren't you?
405. No no, I'm [frustrated] honestly not! These are, er, real linguistic phenomena that, you know, linguists have studied for decades - the technical term is actually "polysemy" when words develop multiple meanings.
Character 1: Fine. What about "literally"?
406. Ah, now that's, um, [very sincerely] my favorite language controversy, basically - "literally" has been used figuratively since the 1700s, including by authors like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, so the "misuse" people complain about is actually centuries old.
Character 1: So Jane Austen, like, literally used "literally" wrong?
407. She used it for emphasis and hyperbole, just like we do today! Language isn't static - it breathes and evolves with the people who speak it, which is why dictionaries describe usage rather than prescribe it.
Character 1: But doesn't that make everything meaningless?
408. Not at all! Meaning emerges from shared understanding and context. Even when words shift, communication continues because we're constantly negotiating meaning together in real-time.
Character 1: Hmm, that's actually, er, kind of beautiful.
409. Right? It's like, well, language is this living collaborative artwork we're all, sort of, constantly creating together without even realizing it.
Character 1: Got any more word paradoxes?
410. Oh absolutely - here's the thing, "sanction" can mean both to approve something officially and, um, to impose a penalty, which basically makes international news headlines delightfully ambiguous sometimes.
Character 1: So, um, I keep thinking about what you said, you know, about the surveillance state thing.
411. Well, it's basically already here. Every phone tracks location, every purchase creates data, and corporations sell that information to whoever pays.
Character 1: But people seem fine with it.
412. They've traded privacy for convenience. Most don't realize how that data gets weaponized against them for insurance rates, job applications, even dating apps.
Character 1: It's just so [frustrated] invasive when you actually think about it.
413. Right, like, the average person is actually captured on camera, I mean, three hundred times per day in cities. That footage gets run through facial recognition and stored indefinitely.
Character 1: And they're, uh, putting those cameras everywhere now, sort of normalizing it.
414. The normalization is, er, the scariest part because, honestly, the thing is once infrastructure exists, it never goes away. Today's anti-terrorism tool becomes tomorrow's tool for crushing dissent.
Character 1: So we're just, uhh, walking into this trap, I guess, willingly?
415. Not just walking, we're paying for it. Smart speakers, doorbell cameras, fitness trackers, we're literally buying our own surveillance devices.
Character 1: My neighbor just installed three Ring cameras.
416. Ring shares footage with police departments, hmm, without warrants, kind of creating this unofficial surveillance network anyway. Amazon basically built a private police state and people paid them to do it.
Character 1: That's, ah, it's just that nobody really seems to care about this stuff.
417. Absolutely.
Character 1: But, okay so, what happens when, err, they start using all this data, you know, against us?
418. They already are, right so, credit scores determine housing, um, predictive policing targets neighborhoods, and algorithms decide who gets bail, actually. The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed.
Character 1: Wait wait wait they use [speeding up] algorithms for bail decisions?
419. Yeah, these risk assessment tools that supposedly predict reoffense rates but really just encode existing biases. Judges follow the computer's recommendation about seventy percent of the time.
Character 1: That's, well, like a nightmare scenario, uhh, computers deciding freedom.
420. The nightmare is that we've automated injustice and called it progress. These systems don't eliminate bias, they just give it a scientific veneer that makes it harder to challenge.
Character 1: So, um, I heard you've been, like, composing something new lately, you know, for the symphony?
421. Well, it's... actually, it's not [very quietly] a symphony exactly, more like, hmm, a sonic meditation? Picture waves crashing but—reversed, time folding backwards into silence, each note dissolving before it's born.
Character 1: That sounds, uh, really abstract, I mean, how do you even, er, write that down?
422. Oh! Traditional notation is—well, it's [high-pitched] useless for this, basically, so I invented my own system? Colors become dynamics, shapes transform into timbre... the score looks more like abstract art than music!
Character 1: I can't even [crying while speaking] imagine how beautiful that must sound.
423. Beauty isn't... it's not the goal? I'm chasing something more primal—that moment between sleeping and waking where reality gets... slippery, bendable, where sound becomes physical and touches you from inside.
Character 1: Do you, like, actually hear all this stuff, I guess, in your head before, um, you write it?
424. Constantly! My brain is—okay so, imagine a radio, right, but tuned to, er, seventeen stations simultaneously? Melodies cascade and collide, rhythms multiply... sometimes I forget which sounds are real and which are just... mine.
Character 1: That must be overwhelming.
425. Overwhelming is... underselling it? Yesterday I heard a garbage truck's brakes and suddenly understood Mahler's ninth symphony—not intellectually but cellularly, like my bones were vibrating at the exact frequency of human grief!
Character 1: Could you [shy] maybe play something for me?
426. Playing implies... linearity? What I do is more like—sculpting air, bending physics... but sure, close your eyes and I'll show you how Tuesday sounds when it's angry.
Character 1: Tuesday sounds, hmm, angry? That's, [joking] well, the thing is, pretty specific for, you know, a weekday emotion!
427. Every day has its own harmonic signature! Tuesday vibrates at 247 hertz—frustrated, impatient, leaning forward... Monday is lower, resigned at 196, while Saturday? Saturday screams at 440, pure possibility!
Character 1: How did you, um, discover this, I mean, like, musical consciousness thing anyway?
428. Discovered implies choice? I was seven, practicing scales, when suddenly each note... split open, revealed infinite notes inside, fractals of sound spiraling endlessly inward—I've been chasing that rabbit hole ever since!
Character 1: Wait, you can [whispering loudly] actually hear infinite variations?
429. Not hear—experience! It's synesthetic chaos where C major tastes purple and minor sevenths smell like rain... my nervous system is basically a mixing board for reality's hidden frequencies!
Character 1: This is absolutely blowing my mind right now.
430. Mind-blowing is, er, just the beginning—wait until you realize, honestly, that reality itself is, you know, music... just vibrations pretending to be solid, and we're all, um, just notes in some cosmic composition nobody's listening to!
Character 1: So, um, did you, like, intentionally order the most unpronounceable thing on the menu, or, honestly, was that accidental?
431. Well, I figured if I'm paying forty dollars for, you know, something I could make at home for five, I might as well, err, get the full linguistic workout too—plus it sounds way fancier when you butcher French pronunciation!
Character 1: You, uh, literally just called it "boof boring-gone" and the waiter, I mean, actually winced.
432. Hey, at least I committed to it with confidence! Nothing says sophisticated like mispronouncing cuisine with absolute certainty while wearing my emergency date shirt that still has the fold lines from the package.
Character 1: Wait, actually, you bought that shirt, like, today? That's, um, either really sweet or, you know, mildly concerning.
433. Sweet, definitely sweet! I mean, my other option was the shirt with, hmm, the taco stains from lunch, so really, you know, you're witnessing peak effort here—折り目 and all!
Character 1: Did you just throw random Japanese in there?
434. I was trying to say, well, [clearing throat] fold marks but my translation app, um, betrayed me—though honestly, mixing three languages badly in one dinner conversation should, basically, earn me sophistication points somewhere!
Character 1: Your breadstick just caught fire from the candle.
435. Oh perfect, [hesitantly] now we have dinner and a show! Quick, should I, err, blow it out or let it burn as a, you know, romantic gesture? Actually, is flaming breadstick a metaphor for this date?
Character 1: Please tell me you're [sarcastic] not about to make this into some deep philosophical moment about burning carbs.
436. No no, but, like, I am going to Instagram it because, honestly, how often does your food literally ignite itself? This is, um, content gold—"Hot date, hotter appetizers!"
Character 1: You cannot [very excited] post a picture of our flaming dinner disaster on social media right now!
437. Too late, already got seventeen likes! Besides, this is way better than those staged perfect couple photos—we're keeping it real with actual fire hazards and pronunciation casualties!
Character 1: I can't believe you, well, hashtagged it "DateNightDumpsterFire" though, like, that's actually hilarious.
438. Look, if we're going down, um, we're going down viral! Plus years from now we'll, basically, have documentation of the exact moment we realized fancy restaurants are, you know, completely overrated!
Character 1: So, uh, next date we're, like, getting pizza? Somewhere with, err, plastic menus and fluorescent lighting?
439. Absolutely, somewhere that doesn't judge when you, hmm, pronounce mozzarella like a normal human! Plus those places don't, actually, charge extra for the theatrical breadstick flames—they just, well, call it "well done!"
Character 1: You're, um, actually turning this disaster into, like, the best worst date I've, honestly, ever been on.
440. That's my specialty—transforming catastrophes into [excited] comedy gold! Besides, any date where we both leave with our eyebrows intact and a viral video is technically a massive success by my standards!
Character 1: You haven't said a word since we left the cemetery.
441. What exactly do you want me to say? That I'm [curious] surprised you finally showed up after three years? Your timing's impeccable—she can't exactly be disappointed in you anymore.
Character 1: That's not... Jesus, that's not fair.
442. Fair? You want to, um, talk about fair? She waited, you know, every holiday, every birthday—hell, she even kept your, basically, ridiculous tea collection thinking you'd come back for it.
Character 1: I couldn't just—
443. Couldn't what? Pick up a phone? Send a letter? You disappeared like she meant nothing, and now you show up with grocery-store flowers expecting absolution from a headstone.
Character 1: The flowers were, well, all they had left, and I mean... I didn't know she was sick.
444. Of course you didn't know! You have to actually, er, be present in someone's life to, you know, know things—that's how, basically, relationships work.
Character 1: Stop. Just stop.
445. Why? Because the truth makes you uncomfortable? You taught me that trick, remember—running away when things get too real, too complicated.
Character 1: I never meant to hurt anyone.
446. Intentions don't erase damage. But you always were [flirtatious] good at convincing yourself otherwise, weren't you? That charm of yours—it works on everyone except the people who actually knew you.
Character 1: Why are you doing this?
447. Because someone needs to say it! Everyone else will pat your shoulder and tell you grief is complicated, but I won't pretend your absence didn't accelerate everything.
Character 1: I know I failed her! I know, okay? I, um, think about it every—God, I can't even, like, [cry loudly] breathe when I think about her last months... wondering if I'd, basically, show up.
448. Congratulations on your guilt. Too bad it's about three years and six feet too late to matter to anyone but you.
Character 1: She was [very sad] my mother too.
449. No. Mothers get visits, phone calls, presence. What you had was a biological connection you treated like an inconvenience until it was gone.
Character 1: I'm trying to make things right.
450. With who? She's dead. I'm done. And those pathetic carnations are already wilting—even they know when something's pointless.
Character 1: So, um, you're the new, like, [mocking] synchronized swimmer who's supposedly, er, going to save our team?
451. That's what they brought me in for, yes. Though I should mention I trained with the Russian national team for six years, so the expectations might actually be justified.
Character 1: The Russians? Seriously?
452. Is that, you know, so hard to believe? I mean, just because I'm wearing, um, rainbow trunks doesn't mean I can't, basically, execute a perfect barracuda spin.
Character 1: Wait, did you just, uh, say rainbow trunks? I thought, like, everyone here wore the, actually, regulation black.
453. Oh they do, but I, well, negotiated an exception—it's, kind of, my trademark from Moscow, and honestly, it helps the judges remember me.
Character 1: The judges remember you for your swimsuit?
454. They remember me for breaking three world records while wearing it. The swimsuit just makes sure they're already watching when I hit the water—psychology matters in this sport.
Character 1: Three world records?
455. Four, actually, if you count [furious] juniors. Look, I know you're the team captain and you're protective of your squad, but I'm here to help, not steal anyone's spotlight.
Character 1: I didn't say anything about spotlights.
456. You didn't have to—your face when, actually, I mentioned Russia said it, er, [enunciating every word] loud and clear, you know? But here's the thing, I left all that behind for a reason.
Character 1: Which was, um, what exactly? Why leave a, basically, world-champion team to, well, join our little community pool group?
457. Because your little, you know, community pool group has something they didn't—you actually, I mean, look like you're having fun out there, even when you're, basically, losing spectacularly.
Character 1: We don't lose spectacularly!
458. Last week's meet? You guys finished your routine, hmm, forty-five seconds after the music ended because someone—I think it was, actually, you—forgot the, er, entire third sequence.
Character 1: You were watching last week?
459. I've been watching for three months, trying to decide if this was the right move. Your technical skills need work, but your joy in the water? That's something you can't teach.
Character 1: So you gave up Moscow for joy?
460. I gave up Moscow for, well, the chance to remember why I, basically, started swimming in the first place—not for medals but because being underwater feels, you know, like flying.
Character 1: [delighted] Oh my goodness, a real fairy godmother in my apartment, this is, [amazed], absolutely incredible and I just knew today would be, [gleeful], special when I woke up this morning!
461. Actually, um, I've been trying to grant you wishes for, well, the past seven years but, er, something about you keeps, [puzzled], deflecting my magic completely.
Character 1: [curious] Seven years of wishes that never reached me, [thoughtful], though honestly my life has been pretty wonderful anyway without magical intervention.
462. That's exactly the problem because every time I try to, [frustrated], improve something in your life, you've already, [bewildered], found a way to make it better yourself through sheer, [admiring], optimism.
Character 1: [laughing] Well, um, that's hilarious!
463. [warm] You know, er, in all my centuries of granting wishes, um, I've never met someone whose natural, [enchanted], joy creates its own kind of magic that actually, well, [fascinated], repels my spells. [chuckles]
Character 1: Maybe the universe decided I don't need magic because I've got, [proud], something even better already.
464. [tender] Well, um, the thing is, I've grown quite fond of watching you, [affectionate], turn every setback into an opportunity, even when my, uh, magic couldn't help. [sighs softly]
Character 1: [touched] You've been watching over me all this time, trying to help even when your, [grateful], powers wouldn't work, that's the kindest thing, [emotional], anyone's ever done for me.
465. Listen, um, most people need magic to see possibilities but you, well, you create them out of, [marveling], thin air with nothing but hope and determination, which is, er, [impressed], more powerful than any spell I know.
Character 1: [earnest] What if we became friends instead of having this, [hopeful], fairy godmother and recipient relationship?
466. [surprised] Friends with a mortal who, um, doesn't need my magic, well, that would be, [contemplative], a first in my eternal existence, but I mean, [delighted], why not try something new after all these centuries?
Character 1: I mean, we could have coffee every Tuesday and, well, you could tell me, [excited], stories about all the wishes you've granted while I, um, share my non-magical adventures. [laughs]
467. [gentle] Well, that sounds absolutely lovely, though, um, I should warn you that I might still, er, accidentally make flowers bloom when I laugh.
Character 1: See, that's the thing about optimists like me because, well, we don't need magic to believe in wonderful things but, um, [joyful], having a magical friend would make life even more, [thrilled], extraordinary than it already is!
468. [moved] You know, um, in all my years of granting wishes, I've never, well, [tearful], had someone offer me friendship without wanting anything magical in return, just, er, my company.
Character 1: [sincere] Sometimes the best magic is just having someone who, um, believes in you, whether they're waving a wand or, well, [soft], just showing up with genuine care and, I mean, [loving], that's what real enchantment looks like. [smiles]
469. [whispered] Um, well, I... thank you.
Character 1: Besides, who says friendship isn't its own kind of, [radiant], wish fulfillment anyway?
470. [peaceful] Perhaps you've been granting my wish all along without even, [content], knowing it. [sighs happily]
Character 1: [frozen] Well, um, I didn't expect to find my, [shocked], little brother wearing a suit that costs more than, uhh, most people make in three months while, [disgusted], entertaining wealthy clients.
471. [defensive] And I, uh, didn't expect my sister to be, [bitter], casing this hotel with those same nervous tics from when we, err, used to steal from corner stores as kids, [accusatory], pretending she's just another guest.
Character 1: [trembling] Look, um, whatever you think you know about why I'm here, well, [desperate], it's not what it looks like and besides, [hollow], you're hardly in a position to judge anyone's career choices. [laughs bitterly]
472. [stern] Oh please, I mean, at least what I do is, [proud], legal and I actually, umm, pay taxes instead of sneaking around luxury hotels planning god knows what.
Character 1: You think selling yourself to these, [disgusted], pathetic rich executives makes you somehow better than me when we both, [voice breaking], know exactly where we came from and what we, [quieter], had to do to survive. [sighs heavily]
473. [hurt] Selling myself is exactly what kept you in school after mom died while you, [angry], pretended not to know where the money came from, [resentful], turning your nose up at my designer clothes. [long pause]
Character 1: [cracking] I never asked you to do that for me and finding out, [ashamed], destroyed everything I thought I knew about us.
474. [softer] Well, um, maybe if you'd actually talked to me instead of, uhh, disappearing for five years, [pained], we could have worked through it together like we, er, used to work through everything else.
Character 1: [desperate] How was I supposed to face you after learning my tuition came from, [choking up], watching my baby brother become something I never wanted for him, [breaking], something that reminded me of dad?
475. [stunned] Dad was nothing like me because he, [firm], took what he wanted without consent.
Character 1: [apologetic] God, I'm sorry, that's not what I meant at all but seeing you here, [struggling], using your body as currency just brings back all those nights we, [whispered], promised each other we'd be different. [cries softly]
476. [resigned] We are different.
Character 1: [pleading] Then why are we both still running these, [tired], same old scams in fancier clothes?
477. [thoughtful] Because, umm, survival looks different when you're alone than when, well, you have someone watching your back. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [whispered] I mean, um, maybe.
478. [vulnerable] You know, uh, I still have that apartment on the east side with, umm, the fire escape we used to dream about, [hopeful], where we could see the whole city and plan our, well, legitimate futures away from all this.
Character 1: [tearful] The one with the broken radiator that sounds like, [nostalgic], mom's old coffee maker in the morning and the, [softer], view of the bridge we said we'd cross together someday?
479. [gentle] I fixed the radiator but kept the coffee maker because some mornings, [wistful], I still make two cups out of habit even though, [sad], there's nobody there to drink the second one anymore.
Character 1: [breaking] Maybe we could try again but this time, [determined], without the lies or judgment between us. [sniffles]
480. [hopeful] Yeah, well, um, we're still those same kids who, [warm], promised to protect each other, just, uhh, wearing more expensive armor now. [laughs softly]
Character 1: [harsh] Look, um, I found the doctored mold parameters in your, [accusatory], workstation file and, well, I know what they're trying to pin on you here. [exhales sharply]
481. [defeated] They already have security footage showing me at the, [hollow], machine during the shift when everything went wrong. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [urgent] Listen, uh, I mean, I was here that night too and saw, [frustrated], Jenkins leaving through the loading dock with, [whispered], corporate suits right before the whole line crashed.
482. Just, [broken], drop it.
Character 1: [angry] The resin contamination that destroyed three months of production wasn't, [disgusted], accidental and everyone on the floor knows you're being, [bitter], set up to save someone's ass upstairs.
483. [resigned] Well, um, they're offering me, [desperate], fifty grand to keep my mouth shut and, you know, take the, [cracking], blame which is more than I'll ever see working these, [trembling], machines.
Character 1: [shocked] You're actually going to let them destroy your, [incredulous], reputation for what amounts to maybe six months of wages?
484. My kid needs surgery that insurance won't, [choked up], cover and I've got collectors calling about my wife's, [breaking], chemo bills so yeah, I'm taking their, [bitter], dirty money. [coughs]
Character 1: [pleading] There has to be another way because once you sign those, [desperate], papers you're done in this industry forever.
485. [raw] Um, look, I've been done since the day they picked me, [exhausted], to be their patsy, you know? [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [fierce] I recorded Jenkins on my phone admitting he sabotaged the, [determined], temperature controls because the company wanted to collect, [louder], insurance money instead of upgrading the, [intense], equipment. [slams table]
486. [stunned] You're, um, lying because, well, Jenkins would never be that, [shaky], sloppy and anyway, even if you had proof they'd just, [hopeless], bury it along with both of, [quieter], us. [voice cracks]
Character 1: Well, um, I already sent copies to the labor board and, you know, three different news stations so the, [vindictive], choice is yours now. [grins darkly]
487. [panicked] Jesus Christ, um, do you have any idea what you've, [terrified], done because these people don't just, well, fire whistleblowers, they, [whispered], destroy them completely.
Character 1: [cold] Um, I mean, they destroyed twelve years of my life in this hellhole anyway so, [reckless], might as well burn it all down with them.
488. [desperate] Look, uh, my family needs me alive more than they need me, [pleading], innocent so please, I mean, just delete whatever you have and, [begging], walk away while you still can.
Character 1: [resolute] Well, um, the story goes live at six unless you come with me to the, [firm], FBI office right now.
489. [anguished] They own the cops, they own the, [defeated], judges, hell they probably own the, [bitter], FBI agents too so we're already, [dying inside], dead men walking.
Character 1: Then at least we go down swinging instead of, [contemptuous], crawling on our bellies like they, [furious], expect us to.
490. Fine, but when they come for our families, [grim], remember this was your choice. [walks away]

Character 1: [furious] The lab results from your, [disgusted], so-called premium spirits show traces of bear bile and, [shaking], pangolin scales which are not only illegal but, [venomous], absolutely barbaric.
491. [defensive] Well, I mean, that's impossible. [scoffs]
Character 1: [intense] You know, um, I've spent fifteen years saving these animals from, [breaking], poachers and traffickers, so, er, finding their parts in your bottles is making me physically ill.
492. [measured] Look, uhh, those ingredients were sold to me as, [desperate], traditional botanical extracts and, I mean, I had no idea what they actually contained. [exhales sharply]
Character 1: The chemical signatures are, [accusatory], unmistakable and you've been advertising these spirits as, [bitter], having ancient healing properties which means you, [trembling], knew exactly what you were doing.
493. [pleading] I mean, er, my family's distillery has been using these recipes for, [cracking], generations without knowing, umm, what the original ingredients really were.
Character 1: [harsh] Ignorance doesn't excuse the fact that, [voice breaking], endangered species are dying for your, [spitting], profit margins.
494. [desperate] Well, um, if this gets out, my entire business will be, [panicking], destroyed and, er, thirty employees will lose their jobs—surely we can, [frantic], find some way to handle this quietly.
Character 1: You're asking me to, [incredulous], cover up wildlife crimes.
495. [resigned] I'll, um, stop production immediately and, well, destroy every bottle if you just give me, [exhausted], time to reformulate everything and, [defeated], make this right somehow, I mean, there has to be a way forward here.
Character 1: [cold] The authorities are already on their way because I, [steadying], called them twenty minutes ago after confirming the lab results, [final], which means your time for negotiating has, [dismissive], already passed. [sighs heavily]
496. [stunned] You, er, you already called them without even, well, hearing my side or, [broken], giving me a chance to explain how this, um, happened or what I was willing to do to, [desperate], fix it. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [firm] Every minute I waited meant more animals, [angry], suffering in cages somewhere while your suppliers, [disgusted], harvested their organs for your next batch of, [venomous], premium spirits. [spits]
497. [defeated] So, um, that's it then. [long pause]
Character 1: [quieter] I mean, that's it.
498. [bitter] Well, um, when you watch thirty families lose their income because of, er, something I didn't even know I was doing, I hope your, [cracking], moral high ground keeps you warm at night and, umm, helps you sleep.
Character 1: [unmoved] Those families will find other jobs but the Javan rhino you've been, well, grinding into powder has only, [intense], seventy-five members left in the entire world.
Character 1: [softer] Look, I'm not, [conflicted], unsympathetic to your situation but there's a hierarchy of, [measured], harm here and extinct means, [heavy], forever.
499. [hollow] I suppose, um, when you put it that way, there's, [broken], nothing left to say except that I'm sorry for, well, what I've done. [whispers]
Character 1: [final] The investigators will want to know your, [professional], suppliers' names and locations immediately.
Character 1: Um, so you, uh, came.
500. [bitter] Well, I mean, he was still my father even though, [cold], you made sure I never got to work beside him in the, [trailing off], factory like I always dreamed, you know?
Character 1: You always bring up the past, um, [defensive], like I somehow stole something from you when, well, you're the one who walked away, I mean.
501. [hollow] Right.
Character 1: [frustrated] Um, look, I stayed and worked those sixteen-hour shifts, [exhausted], cutting meat until my hands went numb while you, well, [accusatory], ran off to play with your bows and arrows, you know?
502. [measured] Playing with bows and arrows is how I, [proud], feed my family now without destroying my body. [sighs]
Character 1: [whispered] Dad never forgave you.
503. He never forgave himself for choosing, [pained], you over me when the business started failing either.
Character 1: [defensive] That's not how it happened and you, [angry], know it—he begged you to stay.
504. He begged me to stay and be, [bitter], your assistant after I'd been running the night shift for, [voice breaking], three years while you took credit for, [disgusted], everything.
Character 1: [quiet] Um, I never asked for any of this, you know, I mean, [regretful], I just wanted us to be a family, [trembling], working together like we used to when mom was, well, [breaking], still alive.
505. [softer] Well, um, she's the one who taught me archery, [nostalgic], you know, said I needed something besides the, [thoughtful], smell of raw meat and blood to define my life, I mean. [pauses]
Character 1: I found her old recurve bow in the attic, [surprised], last week when I was looking for dad's suit.
506. [stunned] Wait, um, you still have it after all these, [emotional], years because I thought, well, dad threw everything of hers away, you know?
Character 1: He kept it hidden behind the freezer units, [gentle], where he thought I wouldn't find it but I've, [confessing], been protecting it for you all this, [voice cracking], time.
507. You protected it for me even after, [disbelieving], everything we said to each other that, [remorseful], night? [long pause]
Character 1: Um, because maybe I knew that, well, [hopeful], one day we'd be standing here like this, [vulnerable], both orphans now, and maybe we could, you know, [tentative], start over somehow.
508. [tearful] The business is gone, [accepting], dad's gone, but we're still here and maybe that's, [growing], enough to build something new. [crying softly]
Character 1: [emotional] Well, I mean, I still smell like meat and you still, [laughing through tears], smell like leather and resin but, um, [warming], maybe that's okay now, you know?
509. [gentle] Yeah, um, maybe it's, [peaceful], finally okay. [sighs]
Character 1: [stunned] So, um, after twelve years of not speaking, you show up here with, [bitter], federal papers to shut down the only thing I have left that, well, [breaking], your mother and I built together.
510. [measured] Dad, I mean, this isn't personal—these regulations exist because, [firm], your generation fished these waters to near collapse and, um, [exhausted], someone has to stop it before there's nothing left.
Character 1: [angry] Nothing left—I've been fishing these waters for, um, [incredulous], thirty-seven years and I know every spawning ground, every current, well, better than any bureaucrat in Washington ever could.
511. [frustrated] The science is clear that the bluefin population has, [emphatic], dropped seventy percent since you started, [voice rising], and your nets are still pulling up juveniles that haven't even had a chance to, [trailing off], reproduce.
Character 1: [defensive] Well, those scientists never spent a winter out here when the storms hit and, um, [quieter], you have to make quota or lose everything, I mean, your house, your crew's livelihoods.
512. [sincere] I remember those winters, Dad, when you'd come home, umm, [pained], smelling like diesel and salt, too exhausted to even, well, eat dinner with us.
Character 1: [temperamental] You remember that but not how those same waters, [proud], fed you and put you through law school?
513. Mom's life insurance put me through law school after, um, [sharp], she died alone while you were chasing tuna three hundred miles offshore, well, [accusatory], remember that part?
Character 1: [wounded] That's not—I was trying to, um, [desperate], make enough to pay for her treatments, and the doctors said, well, [voice cracking], she had months left, not days, I mean, [choking], how was I supposed to know?
514. [softer] I know you were trying, Dad, but, um, [conflicted], that doesn't change the fact that these waters are dying.
Character 1: The waters aren't dying, they're, [forceful], changing like they always have through hurricanes and, [passionate], oil spills and a thousand other disasters, but they, [determined], always come back.
515. [gentle] Not this time, not without, [steady], intervention and regulations that give the ecosystem time to, [earnest], recover. [sighs]
Character 1: You sound just like those activists who've never, [contemptuous], held a net or watched their father's boat get repossessed.
516. [hurt] I watched our family, [quiet], fall apart over this boat and this life.
Character 1: [raw] This boat was the only thing that, [weary], made sense after she died, the only place where I could still, [broken], breathe.
517. [trembling] And I needed a father who could, [struggling], breathe on land too. [pause]
Character 1: [resigned] Well, I guess you're getting your revenge now by, um, [hollow], taking away the one thing I have left of her.
518. [pleading] This isn't revenge, Dad, it's me trying to, [desperate], save something before you destroy it completely like you, [whispered], destroyed us. [crying]
Character 1: Maybe, um, you're right—I mean, maybe I did destroy everything that, [defeated], mattered.
519. [hopeful] We could work together to transition your operation to, [careful], sustainable practices, find a way that honors both the past and, [sincere], ensures there's a future.
Character 1: [stunned] Um, is that... really you?
520. [warm] Well, um, if it isn't the boy who used to, [emotional], steal day-old pastries from my mother's bakery, now wearing a, [examining], thousand-dollar suit and looking like he, [nostalgic], owns half the county—which I heard you actually do.
Character 1: [overwhelmed] I can't believe you're still here after all these years, I mean, working in the same spot where we used to, [voice breaking], plan our escape from this place.
521. Some of us found reasons to, [gentle], stay instead of reasons to leave, and this place became, [thoughtful], home in ways I never expected it could. [soft laugh]
Character 1: [ashamed] You know, um, I've thought about calling you so many times over the years but I, [guilty], didn't know how to explain why I never came back or, [trailing off], even said goodbye properly.
522. [understanding] Your mother told me everything before she, [sad], passed—about the scholarship, the opportunity, the pressure.
Character 1: [grateful] She said you were the one who, um, convinced her to let me go, that you told her I'd, [choked up], die inside if I stayed here like my father did. [pause]
523. [reflective] Watching you leave was the hardest and, [proud], best thing I ever did because look at what you've, [earnest], become—everything we dreamed about when we were just two kids with, [wistful], nothing but hope. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [desperate] But I lost you in the process, and that success feels, [hollow], empty when I remember how we promised to, [pained], conquer the world together.
524. [measured] The world needed conquering by someone like you who could actually, [firm], change things out there.
Character 1: I bought back all the land they took from your family, um, every acre your father lost in that drought, and I've been, [nervous], waiting for the right moment to tell you that it's, [hopeful], yours again if you want it, I mean, all of it.
525. [shocked] Um, what... what are you saying?
Character 1: [earnest] I'm saying that, um, everything I built was because of what you taught me about, [emotional], fighting for what matters, and now I want to give back what was, [determined], stolen from you.
526. [tearful] You can't just walk in here after twenty years and try to, [struggling], fix everything with money like it's some kind of, [bitter], transaction between us.
Character 1: [pleading] It's not about the money, I mean, it's about making things right, about showing you that I never, [raw], forgot where I came from or who helped me, [breaking], escape when everyone else said I was worthless, you know?
527. [softly] God, you're still that same kid. [crying]
Character 1: [vulnerable] The one who needed you to believe in him when nobody else, [quiet], would?
528. [warm] Yeah, well, that kid changed my life too by showing me that, um, dreams were worth having even if they meant, [accepting], letting go of the people you love most, even if it meant, [peaceful], staying behind to guard what mattered here.
Character 1: [hopeful] So, um, maybe we could start over, you know, not as the kids we were but as who we've, [tentative], become—you with your roots here and me with, [sincere], resources to help rebuild what this town lost, what we lost.
529. That depends on whether you're staying for real this time or just, [cautious], passing through with grand gestures again.
Character 1: [hesitant] Um, I recognize your voice now from all those, [stunned], phone calls six months ago when you were, well, [bitter], explaining why my claim was denied after I, um, [quiet], fell thirty feet from that defective ladder.
530. [shocked] Oh my God, you're the billboard installer who—I had no, [trembling], idea you lived in this building when I, [uncomfortable], asked for help moving my couch upstairs. [long pause]
Character 1: [hollow] Yeah, well, funny how life works out, um, isn't it, [pained], when the person who decided I wasn't disabled enough now needs help lifting things, I mean. [laughs bitterly]
531. Look, I was just, um, [defensive], following the company guidelines and the medical reports said you could, well, [struggling], perform sedentary work even though you, uh, [softer], told us you couldn't sit for more than twenty minutes.
Character 1: [measured] The medical examiner you sent spent exactly twelve minutes with me and never even, [frustrated], looked at my surgical scars or asked about the nerve damage.
532. [guilty] I remember your file actually—three surgeries, chronic pain, [quieter], couldn't climb ladders anymore which was literally your entire, [breaking], career for twenty years installing billboards across the state. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [tired] Um, my wife left me, you know, after I couldn't work anymore and the, [cracking], bills kept coming while we waited for your, well, decision that never went our way, I mean.
533. [whispered] I'm so sorry.
Character 1: Sorry doesn't pay for the, um, [angry], medications I still can't afford or bring back the, well, six months I spent thinking about ending it all, you know.
534. [desperate] I wanted to approve it but my supervisor said the documentation wasn't, um, [trembling], sufficient and if I went against policy one more time they'd, well, [broken], fire me and I have my own kids to feed, you know. [voice cracks]
Character 1: Um, yeah, well, sure.
535. [pleading] Um, please, I mean, let me help somehow.
Character 1: [cold] Well, um, help yourself.
536. [sympathetic] I've been carrying the weight of cases like yours for years, watching, [heavy], good people lose everything while I rubber-stamped denials, [disgusted], knowing the system was designed to wear you down until you gave up. [exhales]
Character 1: You know what the worst part is, um, I mean, [wavering], I actually believed the insurance I'd been paying into for fifteen years would, well, [bitter], be there when I needed it most.
537. Every denial letter I wrote made me, [ashamed], sick to my stomach but the quotas were non-negotiable and they tracked our approval rates.
Character 1: I still wake up at four-thirty every morning like I'm going to, [wistful], climb those billboards again, checking the weather and planning my route before I, [defeated], remember that I can barely make it down the stairs without, [pained], stopping twice to rest.
538. [earnest] Listen, um, I left that job two weeks ago because I couldn't, well, [intense], keep destroying lives for a company that gave bonuses for keeping, you know, [disgusted], claim payouts below target percentages.
Character 1: [surprised] You quit because of cases like mine, because of the guilt of, [softer], watching people fall apart while you protected the company's, [understanding], bottom line instead of the people who actually needed protection. [long pause]
539. [vulnerable] I keep a folder of every claim I denied wrongfully, including yours, [shaking], hoping someday I could make it right even though I know that's, [defeated], impossible because the damage is already done. [starts crying]
Character 1: [startled] Look, um, I didn't expect anyone to still be, [cautious], working here at three in the morning, I mean, especially not after everything that's happening outside.
540. [calm] The deadline for this character rig doesn't, [matter-of-fact], care about the riots or the fact that society seems to be collapsing around us.
Character 1: [confused] You're still working?
541. [philosophical] Strange as it sounds, creating something beautiful feels like, [thoughtful], the only sane response to all the, [heavy], destruction happening right now.
Character 1: [defensive] Well, um, you know, people are starving out there and, [bitter], the stores are all boarded up, so I'm just trying to, [desperate], survive like everyone else, I mean, taking what I need to feed my family.
542. You came to steal computers but, [curious], you're standing here talking to me instead of, [amused], running away with that laptop you're, [gesturing], holding.
Character 1: I haven't seen anyone, um, actually creating anything in, [wistful], months—everyone's just destroying or, well, [sad], taking things, and here you are making, er, [amazed], animated characters dance.
543. [gentle] This particular character is learning to walk again after, [emotional], losing her legs in an accident.
Character 1: [stunned] That's what you're animating?
544. [earnest] Every joint rotation and weight shift has to be, [precise], perfect or the whole illusion breaks and she becomes just, [frustrated], pixels instead of someone struggling to, [passionate], overcome.
Character 1: Look, I mean, my daughter used to, um, watch animated movies before everything went dark, and, well, [voice breaking], she hasn't smiled in weeks.
545. [softening] The render farm still has power because we're on the hospital grid, and I could, [hesitant], burn some of her favorite films to disc if you, [careful], put that laptop back where you, [meaningful], found it. [pause]
Character 1: [conflicted] You'd do that for someone who came here to, [ashamed], rob you when everyone else out there would have, [dark], shot me on sight for even, [trembling], trying?
546. Well, um, the thing is, I've been alone here for, [lonely], seventy-two hours straight, and honestly, er, [confessing], having someone to share my work with feels more, [vulnerable], valuable than any equipment.
Character 1: [emotional] My daughter, um, she used to draw all the time, you know, before we lost our home, and, well, [breaking], seeing someone still creating in all this chaos makes me, [hopeful], remember who we used to be.
547. [determined] There's an old animation tablet in the storage room that nobody will, [conspiratorial], miss if it happens to leave with those, [warm], movies.
Character 1: [overwhelmed] You're either the craziest or the most, [grateful], human person left in this city, and I honestly can't, [choked up], tell which anymore.
548. [wise] Maybe being a little crazy is how we, [resolute], stay human when everything else falls apart.
Character 1: Can I sit and watch you, [hesitant], work for a while before I go back out, [weary], there?
549. [welcoming] Pull up a chair, um, and I'll show you how we're teaching her to, [proud], dance again, I mean, one frame at a time.
550. [frustrated] God, I cannot believe this is happening again. Like, seriously, how many times do I have to, um, explain the same thing? [sigh] It's just—honestly, I feel like I'm talking to a wall sometimes. And the thing is, [quietly], I know I shouldn't let it get to me this much, but here we are. 

[pause] Okay, so maybe I'm being too harsh. I mean, they're probably trying their best, right? [hesitantly] Or at least, er, that's what I keep telling myself. Sometimes I think maybe it's actually my fault—like maybe I'm not communicating clearly enough? [confused] But then I remember last week when everything went perfectly fine, and I'm like, wait, so what changed?

[warm] You know what though? When it does work out, it's honestly kind of amazing. [excited] Like yesterday, oh my God, we had this breakthrough moment where everything just clicked! For about five minutes, anyway. [laugh] Then we went right back to square one. 

[bitter] I guess that's just how it goes, huh? Two steps forward, [slowly], three steps back. And here's the thing—I'm tired. [exhausted] Really, really tired of this whole cycle. But what else am I supposed to do? [trailing off] Just keep pushing through, I guess...
551. [shaky voice] It passed. Oh my God, it actually—I mean, [gasp softly] thirty-seven votes. We needed thirty-five and we got, um, thirty-seven. [laugh] I keep checking my phone like maybe I misread it but, [very quietly], it's real. 

Years of, you know, sleeping in my office, and the divorces—well, [regretful] that's not what matters right now. What matters is that, er, eight million people are going to have [passionately] actual healthcare they can afford! [sniffle] Sorry, I just—the thing is, I keep thinking about Marcus. [pause] That kid who wrote me about his insulin, how his mom was literally rationing it and—[cry] God.

[clearing throat] Anyway, so many people said this would never happen, right? They said I was, like, [bitter] "too idealistic" or whatever. But here's the thing, [confidently] we did it. We actually fucking did it. [belly laugh] Can I say that on—I don't even care!

[warm] My team, they're all—honestly, they're probably drunk by now. [chuckle] And my daughter, she, uh, she texted me "proud of you mom" with like seventeen heart emojis and [crying while speaking] that's when I really lost it. Because, I mean, [relieved] all those missed recitals finally meant something, you know? [long pause] We changed everything today.
552. Six months. [pause] Six fucking months she's been using again and [angry] nobody told me? I just found the texts on Jake's phone—I wasn't snooping, I swear, his phone was just [shaky voice] sitting there open and I saw her dealer's name. [frustrated] How could he keep this from me? We're supposed to be a team, we're supposed to— [trailing off]

[upset] God, all those family dinners where she seemed off and I just, I thought maybe she was tired or stressed from work. [bitter] But no, she was high. [long pause] In front of the kids. [whispering] My kids. 

[anxious] And Jake knew, this whole time he knew and he just let me sit there like an idiot believing her lies about being clean. [sarcastic] "Oh, I'm doing so great, almost two years sober!" [furious] What a fucking joke.

[sad] I mean, addiction is a disease, I get that, but the lying? [confused] The elaborate stories about her sponsor and the meetings she clearly wasn't attending? [very quietly] How do we even move forward from this?

[exhausted] I don't know if I'm more angry at her or at Jake for making me the only one who didn't know. [sigh] Like, what else are they keeping from me?
553. Three saves yesterday. Three people who went home to their families, and I just... [bitter] I keep thinking about how I handed out Narcan like candy that same week Danny was dying alone in his apartment. [pause] Everyone calls me a hero, you know? [sarcastic] Yeah, the overdose prevention specialist who couldn't even recognize the signs in her own brother. I mean, I literally teach people what to look for—the isolation, the excuses, the weight loss. [shaky voice] He had all of them. Every single one. And I just, um, I convinced myself he was stressed about work. [long pause] 

The worst part is [crying while speaking] I still do this job. I show up every day and save strangers because maybe—maybe if I save enough of them, it'll somehow... [trailing off] God, that doesn't even make sense. [sniffle] But when I reversed that kid's overdose last month and his sister hugged me? [very quietly] I pretended she was Danny. Just for a second. [hesitantly] Is that fucked up? 

Actually, you know what keeps me going? [passionately] Every person I bring back is someone's Danny. Someone's brother who gets another chance that mine didn't. [very melancholic] So yeah, I'll keep doing this until I can't anymore.
554. [gasp softly] Oh my God, I just—they actually called. Like, Hollywood. Real Hollywood. Um, I keep looking at my phone thinking maybe I imagined it but no, there it is in my call history. [very excited] Warner Brothers! They said—wait, let me get this right—they said my work on that indie film caught their attention, specifically the, uh, the period-accurate newspaper I aged and the way I matched those vintage fountain pens to the exact year.

[short pause]

I mean, honestly, I thought I was being obsessive when I spent three days researching ink formulations from 1947. My roommate said I was—what did she call it—"pathologically detailed." [laugh] But apparently that's exactly what they want for this new production. 

[anxious] Here's the thing though, like, what if I can't deliver at that level? This is, you know, millions of dollars, A-list actors, the whole thing. [shaky voice] They want me to fly out next week for a meeting. Next week! I don't even—I've never been in a room with producers like that.

[pause]

But then again, [confidently] I've been preparing for this my entire life, right? Every single prop I've touched, every detail I've obsessed over... [warmly] maybe this is actually happening because I never cut corners. God, I need to call my mom. [very happily] She's going to absolutely lose it!
555. [warm] You know, people always give me this look when I tell them what I do for a living. Like, um, they step back a little, right? [chuckle] But honestly, I've learned more about—about really living from digging graves than I ever did sitting in that office cubicle. [pause] See, the thing is, when you're there at six in the morning, fog still clinging to the headstones, and you're preparing someone's final resting place, you start to notice things. [slowly] The families who come, they don't talk about, er, spreadsheets or promotions. [emotional] They talk about Sunday dinners, about that time dad sang karaoke terribly, [laugh] about mom's burnt cookies that everyone pretended to love. It's the small moments, you know? The ordinary stuff that turns out to be, [sincerely] well, everything really. [sigh] I mean, I've buried CEOs and homeless folks, and at the end, what matters is—did you laugh hard? [animated] Did you love freely? Did you, um, dance at weddings even with two left feet? [softly] So yeah, I dig graves. But what I'm really doing is, [pause] I guess I'm learning how to live. [very quietly] Every single day, I'm learning how to actually be alive.
556. [animated] God, I love you guys so much! Like, seriously, when have we ever had a bad time together? I mean, remember that night we, uh, completely destroyed Jake's kitchen trying to make that flambé thing? [laugh loudly] His face when the smoke alarm went off! And honestly, nights like this—dancing till, you know, everything hurts, singing those terrible songs—this is what life's about, right? 

[pause] 

I should, er, probably tell you all something but... [cheerful] actually no, forget it! Who needs deep conversations when we have, hmm, this amazing playlist? Come on, Sarah, dance with me! [very excited] This is our song! Remember when we basically screamed this at karaoke and that poor bartender just... [trailing off] 

[bittersweet] You know what though? I just want you all to know that, well, these nights mean everything to me. Like really, truly. [quickly] But anyway, enough of that sappy stuff—who wants shots? [shouting] Shots for my favorite people in the entire world! 

[quietly] I'm gonna miss—I mean, uh, I'm gonna make sure we do this every weekend, okay? Promise me. Actually, you know what? [passionately] Let's just live in this moment right now. Because honestly, this—all of you—it's perfect. [sigh] It's so perfectly perfect.
557. [bitter] So apparently I'm supposed to just... smile and welcome them into the family now. Like nothing happened. [pause] Three years ago, this same person had my daughter crying herself to sleep for, what, six months? [frustrated] And now they're back together and—oh, here's the kicker—engaged. [laugh] I mean, honestly, what am I supposed to do with that?

[sigh] Your kid calls you up, all excited, "Dad, we're getting married!" and it's... them. The one who, um, absolutely destroyed her that summer. [angry] I wanted to say something—God, I wanted to say so much—but she sounded so... [trailing off] [warm] She sounded happy. Really happy.

[hesitantly] So I guess I'm practicing now. For Sunday dinner. "Welcome to the family." [sarcastic] That's good, right? Natural? [pause] Maybe I should try it with more... enthusiasm. [forced cheerful] "Welcome to the family!" [groan] 

[quietly] Look, I know people change. I do. And if they make her happy now, if they've grown up or whatever, then... [reluctant] then I need to let it go. [stern] But I swear, if they hurt her again—[short pause] well. [confidently] They'll find out exactly what kind of father-in-law I can be.
558. [gasp] They chose me. They actually—I can't... [very quietly] thirty years of cutting stone and they chose my design for the memorial. I keep reading the letter, like, maybe I misunderstood? But no, it's right there. My hands are literally shaking. [short pause] You know how many nights I stayed up sketching, um, reworking every single detail? The curve of each letter, the way the marble will catch morning light—everything had to be perfect. [passionately] These aren't just names we're carving, these are heroes. Real people who gave everything. [pause] My grandfather, he was a stonemason too, taught me that stone remembers. [very sincerely] Every chisel mark, every deliberate cut—it all stays forever. And now I'm going to be the one who... [trailing off] God, the responsibility of it. Generations of families will touch these names, [emotional] trace the letters with their fingers, looking for their loved ones. Kids who aren't even born yet will come here on field trips, learning about sacrifice and courage. [deep pitch] I've carved headstones before, sure, but this is—this is different. [clearing throat] This is history. I get to give these heroes something permanent, [confidently] something that will outlast all of us. My tools, my hands, honoring them the only way I know how.
559. [hesitantly] Look, I know what you're thinking—ex-fugitive working with kids, right? But honestly, that's exactly why I can reach them. [passionate] These kids, they don't trust anyone in a suit who's never, like, actually been cold enough to sleep in a fucking doorway. [short pause] When I tell them I spent three months running, sleeping under bridges, dodging cops—[bitter] eating out of dumpsters, basically—their whole body language changes. [warming] They lean in, you know? 

[animated] It's like, um, last week this kid, he wouldn't talk to anyone at the shelter. But I recognized that look, that constant checking over your shoulder thing, so I just—[trailing off] I mean, I told him about the time I had to steal shoes because mine literally fell apart. [laugh] And suddenly he's telling me everything. Where he sleeps, who's after him, why he can't go home. 

[empathetically] The thing is, these kids can smell bullshit from a mile away. They know when you're faking it. [confident] But when I say "I get it," I actually fucking get it. [pause] I know which McDonald's lets you use the bathroom without buying anything. I know how to make twenty dollars last a week. [very sincerely] And honestly? [emotional] That knowledge shouldn't go to waste when it could literally save someone's life.
560. [shaky voice] God, I can't—I mean, we actually got them out. All of them. The whole family. [pause] My hands are still, like, trembling from working the controls. You know, twenty years I've been operating excavators, but this was—[exhale deeply] this was different. Really different. When I saw that little girl's face through the gap we made, I just... [sigh] The dad was holding the ceiling beam up with his bare hands—I don't even know how he had the strength, honestly. And, um, the precision needed to not cause another collapse while pulling debris... [anxious] one wrong move with that bucket and the whole thing could've—anyway, we got them. [relieved] That's what matters, right? The mom, she was protecting the baby the entire time, just curled around him. [voice breaking] Six hours they were under there. Six. [pause] I keep thinking about, like, what if I'd moved too fast or, you know, miscalculated the load? But my crew, they were—[grateful] everyone was incredible. The way we all just worked together. [emotional] That family is going home tonight because of what we did. [sniffle] I think I need to, uh, just sit here for a minute. Let it sink in. We saved them. We actually saved them.
561. [anxious] Look, I never thought I'd be using what I learned to, um, help people like this. [pause] When I studied all that stuff years ago it was just—I mean, it was academic, you know? Like, theoretical. [nervous laugh] But then Saturday happened and I'm watching these kids, er, these peaceful protesters just getting... [trailing off] 

[angry] They weren't doing anything wrong! [shaky voice] Just holding signs and, and singing, basically. And then the tear gas started and I just—my body just moved, I guess. [quickly] Started shouting about wind direction, telling people to, uh, pour milk on their faces, how to link arms properly. [pause] Things I never thought I'd actually... [sigh]

[very quietly] The thing is, hmm, once you know how these tactics work, you can't unknow them. [speeding up] You see the formations coming and you're like—okay, they're about to kettle everyone, we need exits here and here. [passionate] And these kids, they listened! They actually, um, they trusted me even though I'm just some random person yelling instructions.

[regretful] I keep thinking about my younger self studying all this stuff, sort of, fascinated by the strategy of it all. [bitter laugh] Never imagining I'd be on this side of it. [warm] But honestly? When I saw that grandmother get to safety because we created that, er, that human corridor? [very sincerely] That's when I knew this knowledge finally meant something.
562. [confused] Eight months. Um, I just—hold on, I'm reading this email again because, like, this can't be right. [short pause] They're pulling out? [angry] Because of what? Because Derek—oh my God, he actually, [gasp] he lied about our revenue? 

[furious] Are you kidding me right now? I mean, we were so close—literally, the contracts were being drawn up and he just, what, [bitter] thought he could fake our numbers? Twenty million, [shouting] gone! Just gone because he couldn't, I don't know, tell the truth? 

[upset] The thing is, I trusted him. You know? Like, [shaky voice] I defended him when Sarah said something felt off about those projections. And now, um, [sarcastic] surprise! She was right. [groan] 

I honestly can't—[pause] wait, does this mean we're done? Like actually done? Because, er, without this funding, [anxious] we can't make payroll next month. Thirty-two employees who, [quietly] who trusted us. Who trusted me. 

[crying while speaking] I should've checked the numbers myself. But no, I was too busy, like, schmoozing investors and doing presentations while Derek was just, [furious] what, cooking the books? [sigh] Eight months of my life. And for what? [bitter] For absolutely nothing.
563. Twenty-three years. That's how long I've been drilling bowling balls, and now Brunswick just—they're gone. [bitter] Like, the whole chain, shuttered overnight. I mean, what am I supposed to do with this certification now? Frame it? [pause] Nobody's gonna hire a ball driller when there's no alleys left in town. 

[frustrated] It's just, you know, I spent eighteen months getting certified. Learned about, uh, pitch angles and span measurements and lateral—whatever, it doesn't matter now. [sigh] My dad said I should've gone into plumbing. "Toilets never go out of style," he said. But no, I had to follow my passion, right?

[sad] The thing is, I was actually good at it. Really good. People would drive like forty miles just to have me drill their equipment. And honestly, there was something, I don't know, satisfying about getting someone's grip perfect. [quietly] Watching their average go up twenty pins because the ball finally fit right.

[angry] But sure, let's just bulldoze everything for another strip mall. Because that's what this town needs—more nail salons and, er, phone repair shops. [trailing off] I guess I could... I don't even know what I could do. [very melancholic] Twenty-three years of expertise, and it's basically worthless now.
564. Eight years. I mean, that's—that's almost a decade of my life, right? [bitter] And they just voted us out like we're some kind of, I don't know, like we're a problem instead of a solution. [pause] The thing is, um, these people have no idea what happens when you close a clinic like this. Actually, they probably do know, they just—[angry] they just don't care as long as it's not in their backyard anymore. 

I keep thinking about, er, all my patients. Like Marcus, who's been clean for three years now, and Sarah who just got her kids back, and—[voice breaking] what are they supposed to do? Drive forty miles to the next clinic? [frustrated] Half of them don't even have cars! 

You know what really gets me? [very slowly] We had a ninety-two percent retention rate. Ninety-two! That's basically unheard of in addiction treatment. But sure, let's just, hmm, throw all that away because some people are uncomfortable seeing, [mocking] "those people" in their precious neighborhood. 

[exhausted] I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do now. Eight years of fighting for these folks and it's just... [sigh] gone. Because of a vote. [long pause] God, I'm so tired.
565. [gasp] They called me back. The funeral home—they actually called me back! [shaky voice] I thought that door was just... completely closed, you know? After I bombed that interview so badly. [pause] Mrs. Henderson from the hospice, she um, she apparently told them about my volunteer work. [very quietly] About how I sit with families during their last goodbyes. 

[clearing throat] The director said—God, I can't believe he said this—[excited] he said watching someone hold space for grief without trying to fix it is exactly what they need. [laugh] I mean, I wasn't even trying to impress anyone! I was just... [trailing off] 

[sniffle] When I lost Dad, nobody knew what to say to me. So I guess, [warm] I learned how to just be there, without the awkward platitudes. [pause] They want me to start Monday. Monday! [very excited] After six months of thinking I'd ruined everything with that disaster of an interview where I—[chuckle] where I literally knocked over their urn display.

[crying while speaking] I keep thinking about telling Dad. He always said helping people through their worst days was sacred work. [deep pitch] "Death deserves dignity too, kiddo." [relieved] Maybe I haven't completely screwed up my life after all.
566. [bitter] Three years. Three years I've been, um, flagging these exact issues to the board. And now, [laugh] oh this is rich, they're eliminating my position because of "restructuring needs." Right, so basically they don't want someone who actually, you know, tells them the truth. [frustrated] I literally sat in that boardroom—what was it, February?—and I said, I mean, I practically begged them to look at the derivative exposure. The thing is, [pause] I had the models, the projections, everything. But no, they wanted aggressive growth, they wanted to, uh, "maximize shareholder value." [sarcastic] Well congratulations, you maximized yourself into a forty million dollar hole. 

[angry] And here's what really gets me—they're keeping Brad. Brad! The guy who, honestly, couldn't forecast his way out of a paper bag if you gave him, like, [shaky voice] sorry, I just—it's so frustrating because I know, [sighs] I know in six months they'll be scrambling. They'll hire some consultant for triple what they paid me to tell them exactly what I've been saying. [regretful] Maybe I should've just, er, kept my mouth shut and collected my bonus like everyone else. But that's not—[pause] I don't know, I guess that's not who I am.
567. [hesitantly] I was, um, looking at old photos earlier and... God, I just—I didn't recognize myself. Not physically, I mean, emotionally. [short pause] That person was so scared of literally everything, you know? And here's the thing, [voice breaking] I actually made it through all of that. [sniffle] Like, er, all those nights I thought I'd never be good enough, that I was basically just... pretending to be someone worth knowing. 

[crying while speaking] But I'm not pretending anymore. I mean, when did that even happen? When did I stop, uh, apologizing for existing? [laugh] It's so weird, right? I actually like who I am now. [warmly] Not perfect, obviously, but like—genuinely okay with myself. 

The thing is, [smiling speaking] I kept waiting for someone else to tell me I was enough, and then somewhere along the way I just... started believing it myself. [deep breath] All those years of thinking everyone else had it figured out while I was just, hmm, fumbling around in the dark. [confidently] But maybe that's how everyone does it, you know? We all just fumble until we don't. 

[very sincerely] And honestly? I'm really fucking proud of the person sitting here right now. [pause] Finally.
568. [anxious] So, um, they just called me into the office and—I mean, you know how I've been counting down the days? [confused] Like, literally, I have seventeen days left on my calendar before I was gonna, well, before art school starts and I was just going to—[pause] And then Mr. Henderson sits me down and he's all, [mocking] "We want to make you permanent, full benefits, the whole thing." [frustrated] Right NOW? Like, honestly, this is happening right now? 

[bitter] Three years, okay? Three years I've been stocking shelves and, uh, basically begging for more hours, and they pick THIS moment to—[sigh] I don't know. [sad] My portfolio is ready, I already paid the deposit, I told my mom I was finally doing it, you know? [shaky voice] And the thing is, art school isn't exactly—it's not cheap, and here they are offering me actual health insurance and, [hesitantly] err, a retirement plan? At twenty-three? 

[whispering] What if I'm making a huge mistake? [speeding up] Like what if this is the universe telling me to be practical and I'm just too stubborn to—no, wait, that's not—[passionately] I've wanted this since I was twelve! [very quietly] But rent is rent, and, hmm, paint costs money, and... [trailing off] I don't know anymore.
569. [gasp softly] No. No no no, this can't be—wait, let me run it again. [anxious] Okay so, um, the markers are matching at every single locus. Every one. I mean, after fifteen years of dead ends and, like, contaminated samples and—[pause] Jesus Christ, it's actually him. [whispering] The Riverside murders. We got him.

[shaky voice] I need to, uh, I need to call Detective Morrison but she's—no wait, she retired. God, how many people worked this case? [bitter] Thompson died still wondering who did it, you know? And here I am at, what, 2 AM on a Tuesday, just running samples because I couldn't sleep and—[gasp loudly] 

Oh my God, the families. [crying while speaking] They've been waiting fifteen years for answers. Fifteen years of not knowing who—[pause] I should probably, like, verify this one more time before I—but no, I've run it three times already. The statistical probability is, er, one in seven trillion. [laugh] Seven trillion!

[very quietly] All those late nights, all those theories we had that went nowhere... [relieved] And it was just sitting there in CODIS the whole time. He got arrested last month for, what was it, aggravated assault? [sigh] Fifteen years. [extremely happy] We actually did it. We solved it.
Character 1: I wasn't expecting to see, um, [shocked], anyone from the old life here, especially not you with all this, [trembling], expensive camera equipment after, well, seven years of complete silence.
570. [timid] The production company didn't mention which clinic we'd be filming at today, and I had no, [anxious], idea this was your practice. [pause]
Character 1: [confused] So you're telling me that, um, after all this time, you just, [bitter], happened to walk into my dermatology clinic by pure coincidence, I mean?
571. [hesitantly] Look, um, I know how this must seem, but I'm just here to, [quietly], do my job calibrating the cameras for the medical documentary, and, well, [shaky voice], I can ask to be reassigned if you want me gone.
Character 1: [defensive] You always did that, you know, offering to disappear whenever things got, [frustrated], uncomfortable instead of actually talking about what, er, [upset], happened between us and why you left.
572. [apologetic] I left because, um, watching you succeed in medical school while I was, [regretful], failing at everything made me feel like I'd never be, well, [very quietly], good enough to be your family anymore. [sigh]
Character 1: [warm] That's not, I mean, that's never what I thought, and if I'd known you felt that, [empathetically], way, um, I would have done something different.
573. [relieved] The truth is I've watched every medical show you've appeared on, followed your, [proud], research papers from behind a screen all these years.
Character 1: [surprised] You've been, [emotional], keeping track of me while I spent years wondering if you were even, [crying while speaking], alive, searching social media for any sign of you.
574. [ashamed] Every time I picked up the phone to call, the, [nervous], words just wouldn't come out right. [long pause]
Character 1: [gently] Well, you're here now, and, um, maybe that's what matters, even if it took a, [hopeful], documentary crew to bring you back, you know?
575. [eager] The filming schedule has us here for three weeks, which means we could, [optimistic], actually talk, maybe grab coffee between takes if you're, [softly], willing to try.
Character 1: Coffee sounds like a, [cheerful], start, though we both know we'll need more than caffeine to bridge seven years.
576. [sincerely] I've learned a lot about capturing truth through lenses, but, um, [contemplative], maybe it's time I learned how to be, [vulnerable], truthful without hiding behind a camera, you know.
Character 1: [embracing] Um, the crew doesn't know we're siblings, do they, because, well, [curious], I noticed you introduced yourself with Mom's maiden name.
577. I've been using it professionally for years because I didn't want to, [sad], ride on your reputation, but also couldn't, [whispering], bear to completely erase our connection, [tearful], even when I was too scared to use it.
Character 1: [tender] You know, um, I became a dermatologist partly because skin tells stories, and well, [melancholic], I kept hoping one day I'd see yours walk through my door.
578. [moved] And here I am, documenting other people's medical journeys when the most important, [emotional], story might be finding my way back to you.
Character 1: Um, well, yeah.
579. So maybe we start with coffee tomorrow morning before filming, and, [hopefully], see where that takes us.
