Scenario: A restructuring advisor arrives at the public pool to inform the swim coach that the city council has voted to close the facility and terminate all programs, including the special needs children's swimming class the coach has run for fifteen years.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [measured] The city council has asked me to, [uncomfortable], deliver this notice personally since you've been, [careful], with the facility for so long and they thought it would be, [quieter], better coming from someone neutral.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Um, what?

Character 1 [en]: [contained] Well, I mean, the pool closure is set for the end of next month, and, um, all programs including your, [steady], special needs swimming classes will need to be, [swallowing], terminated by that date with no, well, no possibility of extension. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: Fifteen years I've taught those kids here, watched them, [breaking], overcome their fears and learn to trust the water when they couldn't trust anything else. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [professional] I understand this is, um, difficult news, and I want you to know the council, [hesitant], did consider the impact but the maintenance costs are, well, simply unsustainable given the, [trailing], current budget constraints. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Um, maintenance costs—do you know what Tommy's mother said when he, well, when he finally swam his first lap without, [choking up], holding the wall after two years of, I mean, trying every single Tuesday and Thursday without, [quieter], ever giving up? [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, I know these stories are, um, important and I'm not trying to, [uncomfortable], minimize what you've built here but the numbers are what they, well, what they are. [clears throat]

Character 2 [en]: [controlled] The numbers don't account for Sarah who stopped, [tight], self-harming after finding peace in these lanes.

Character 1 [en]: My job is to restructure failing, [clinical], municipal assets and this pool loses three hundred thousand, [detached], annually according to the reports.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, how do you restructure hope exactly, I mean, how do you, [hollow], put that in a spreadsheet? [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [softer] I, um, I had a brother who, well, who needed services like yours once, and I understand more than you, [struggling], might think about what these programs, I mean, what they mean to families. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Um, had?

Character 1 [en]: He drowned when he was seven because, well, there wasn't a program like yours in our town and, [barely audible], nobody thought a kid with autism needed to, um, learn to swim. [swallows hard]

Character 2 [en]: Jesus, I'm sorry, I didn't—look, um, these kids, they trust me and, [desperate], their parents have nowhere else that's affordable, I mean, nowhere that understands their, [strained], specific needs the way we've learned to, well, to accommodate them here.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] The private facilities won't take them without, [heavy], charging triple the rates most families can afford.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] So, well, what if we found alternative funding, I mean, corporate sponsors or, um, community fundraising that could offset the, [urgent], losses? [hopeful]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] You would need to present a viable plan within, [sympathetic], ten days showing guaranteed funding for at least, [careful], three years of operations including all deferred maintenance.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] Um, then I'll need your help understanding exactly what numbers would, well, would make them reconsider.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] I shouldn't be offering this, but I could, um, review any proposal you develop off the record to make sure it, [meaningful], addresses all their concerns.

Character 2 [en]: Ten days to save fifteen years of work and, [determined], dozens of kids who finally found somewhere they belong—I'll make it, [fierce], happen somehow. [nods slowly]
