Scenario: An environmental attorney confronts an entrepreneur in residence about a startup's plan to mine lithium from protected wetlands, discovering the entrepreneur was trying to expose the illegal operation.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: Tu és a pessoa que está a orientar a TerraMine Solutions, não és? A startup que acabou de submeter licenças para extrair lítio dos wetlands da Reserva Blackwater? [sharp inhale]

Character 2 [mix]: [measured] Tenho trabalhado com eles há três meses, sim, mas essas licenças de que falas foram submetidas sem o meu conhecimento ou aprovação.

Character 1 [mix]: [incredulous] Sem o teu conhecimento? És a lead advisor deles, as apresentações têm literalmente o teu nome em cada slide, and you're telling me you didn't know?

Character 2 [mix]: [leaning forward] É exatamente isso que te estou a dizer, and it's why I've been trying to reach someone at the EPA since yesterday morning. [exhales]

Character 1 [mix]: [suspicious] Os wetlands que eles querem explorar são o habitat de duas espécies em extinção, a cobra-de-água-de-barriga-cobre e a borboleta sátira de Mitchell, both hanging on by threads.

Character 2 [mix]: [urgently] Eu sei o que está em jogo ecologicamente—aliás, escrevi a minha tese sobre alternativas sustentáveis de extração mineral para proteger exatamente este tipo de ecossistemas vulneráveis. [frustrated grunt]

Character 1 [mix]: Então explica-me isto.

Character 2 [mix]: [grimly] Há três dias, descobri que they'd been using my research and credentials para legitimar uma operação completamente diferente daquela que me apresentaram inicialmente.

Character 1 [mix]: Diferente como? Because from where I'm standing, parece-me greenwashing clássico com a tua reputação académica como a cobertura perfeita.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Originalmente propuseram bio-mining, usando bactérias para extrair lítio de waste streams industriais, zero impacto em habitats naturais, completely closed-loop system. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: [softer] Isso até soa inovador, quase bom demais para ser verdade, which I guess it was.

Character 2 [mix]: A tecnologia é real e já a vi funcionar em condições laboratoriais, but apparently that wasn't profitable enough for their shadow investors.

Character 1 [mix]: [suddenly intense] Shadow investors? Tens nomes, documentação, alguma coisa que nos possa ajudar a parar isto antes de começarem as obras na próxima semana? [pause]

Character 2 [mix]: Tenho estado a recolher tudo—emails, propostas alteradas, environmental impact assessments falsificados com a minha assinatura digital copiada para documentos que nunca vi.

Character 1 [mix]: Temos de submeter uma injunção de emergência hoje, and you'll need to testify about the fraud and forgery aspects.

Character 2 [mix]: [determined] Estou preparada para queimar todas as pontes com a comunidade de venture capital se isso significa proteger aqueles wetlands da destruição.

Character 1 [mix]: Ótimo, porque depois disto, they'll probably try to destroy your reputation anyway, vão alegar que te descontrolaste ou que perdeste a coragem.

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly fierce] Que tentem—tornei-me empreendedora para criar soluções, not to enable the same extractive disasters we've been fighting for decades. [deep exhale]

Character 1 [mix]: [appreciative] Então estamos do mesmo lado, and with your inside knowledge, talvez consigamos mesmo parar isto.

Character 2 [mix]: Há mais uma coisa—tenho gravações do CEO deles explicitly discussing como contornar o processo de revisão ambiental usando o meu nome. [grim satisfaction]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: You're the one mentoring TerraMine Solutions, aren't you? The startup that just filed permits to extract lithium from the Blackwater Reserve wetlands? [sharp inhale]

Character 2: [measured] I've been working with them for three months, yes, but those permits you're talking about were filed without my knowledge or approval whatsoever.

Character 1: [incredulous] Without your knowledge? You're their lead advisor, their presentations literally have your name on every slide, and you're telling me you didn't know?

Character 2: [leaning forward] That's exactly what I'm telling you, and it's why I've been trying to reach someone at the EPA since yesterday morning. [exhales]

Character 1: [suspicious] The wetlands they're targeting are home to two endangered species, the copper-bellied water snake and the Mitchell's satyr butterfly, both hanging on by threads.

Character 2: [urgently] I know the ecological stakes here—I actually wrote my thesis on sustainable mineral extraction alternatives to protect exactly these kinds of vulnerable ecosystems. [frustrated grunt]

Character 1: Then explain this.

Character 2: [grimly] Three days ago, I discovered they'd been using my research and credentials to legitimize a completely different operation than what they pitched to me initially.

Character 1: Different how? Because from where I'm standing, it looks like classic greenwashing with your academic reputation as the perfect cover story.

Character 2: [defensive] They originally proposed bio-mining using bacteria to extract lithium from industrial waste streams, zero impact on natural habitats, completely closed-loop system. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: [softer] That actually sounds innovative, almost too good to be true, which I guess it was.

Character 2: The technology is real and I've seen it work in lab conditions, but apparently that wasn't profitable enough for their shadow investors.

Character 1: [suddenly intense] Shadow investors? You have names, documentation, anything that could help us stop this before they break ground next week? [pause]

Character 2: I've been collecting everything—emails, altered proposals, forged environmental impact assessments with my digital signature copied onto documents I've never seen.

Character 1: We need to file an emergency injunction today, and you'll need to testify about the fraud and forgery aspects.

Character 2: [determined] I'm ready to burn every bridge with the venture capital community if it means protecting those wetlands from destruction.

Character 1: Good, because after this, they'll probably try to destroy your reputation anyway, claim you went rogue or lost your nerve.

Character 2: [quietly fierce] Let them try—I became an entrepreneur to create solutions, not to enable the same extractive disasters we've been fighting for decades. [deep exhale]

Character 1: [appreciative] Then we're on the same side here, and with your inside knowledge, we might actually stop this.

Character 2: There's something else—I have recordings of their CEO explicitly discussing how to circumvent the environmental review process using my name. [grim satisfaction]
