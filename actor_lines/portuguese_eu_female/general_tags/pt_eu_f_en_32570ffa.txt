=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] You look like you haven't had a proper meal in, [concerned], days so please just let me, [warm], fix you something from the kitchen.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitant] That's incredibly kind but I don't have the money to, [embarrassed], pay for a chef's meal and I've learned not to take, [weary], what I can't repay somehow.

Character 1 [en]: [supportive] No, no, I mean, this isn't about money, um, it's just that seeing someone, [recognizing], hungry outside my kitchen goes against everything I, well, [trailing off], believe in as a chef and, um, as a person.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Wait, your voice is so, um, familiar and the way you, [shaking], hold that knife with your left hand even though you're, well, [realizing], right-handed, I mean, oh God, is it really you?

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Hello, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: [broken] I never thought, um, I'd see you again after what I, [guilty], did to you and the restaurant we, well, built together. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [steady] Sit down, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Look, I know what you must think and, um, there's no excuse for taking the money but I was, [hollow], drowning in debts you didn't even know about and, well, [ashamed], the gambling had gotten so bad.

Character 1 [en]: [calm] I'm going to make you the duck confit we, um, used to serve on Sundays, you know, the one with the cherry reduction you loved. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: You're not calling the police or, [confused], screaming at me or even asking where the, [lost], hundred thousand dollars went?

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Five years of anger already ate through me like, [tired], acid through metal until there was nothing left.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] I've been walking from town to town for, um, three years now, never staying anywhere long enough for the guilt to, [haunted], catch up but it always does anyway, and, well, [breaking], seeing you here being kind to me is, um, worse than any punishment. [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [accepting] You know, um, after you left I almost gave up cooking entirely but then I realized the food wasn't, [thoughtful], guilty of anything and neither were the people who needed feeding, so, well, [determined], I started over with just a knife and a pan.

Character 2 [en]: [anguished] The money is gone, every penny lost to, [bitter], bookies and bad bets before I even left town that, [regretful], night in the rain.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] I figured as much when I saw the, [knowing], way your hands shake now.

Character 2 [en]: [raw] I dream about that kitchen we had with the, um, copper pots and the old gas range that only you could, [nostalgic], make work properly and I wake up on park benches, well, [empty], remembering I destroyed it all because I couldn't, um, stop myself from betting on just one more game. [cries softly]

Character 1 [en]: The funny thing is, well, losing everything taught me that, [philosophical], the food matters more than the restaurant and, um, the act of feeding someone matters more than profit.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Why are you being so, um, kind to me when I stole your dream and, well, [wondering], ran like a coward into the night?

Character 1 [en]: [peaceful] Well, um, because I choose to.

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] Maybe that's why you were always the real chef and I was just, well, someone who knew about money until I didn't even know that anymore. [long pause]
