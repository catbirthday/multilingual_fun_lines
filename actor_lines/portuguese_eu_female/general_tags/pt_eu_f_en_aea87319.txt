=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [weary] Marcus, I mean, after all these years of, [disappointed], teaching you everything about these old transmitters, um, this is how you, [defeated], repay that trust?

Character 2 [en]: [proud] Well, you taught me, um, too well about how these, [accomplished], systems work, how to exploit every weakness in the, [bitter], old vacuum tube arrays that you refuse to, [measured], upgrade. [chuckles darkly]

Character 1 [en]: [old-fashioned] These machines have been broadcasting truth for, [reverent], forty years without fail until you started your, [angry], campaign of destruction.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Truth? Um, you mean propaganda, well, dressed up in your, [sarcastic], quaint notions of journalistic integrity?

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You know, um, I used to see myself in you, that same, [nostalgic], passion for understanding how signals travel through space, well, connecting people across impossible, [broken], distances.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] That passion died when I realized these, [contemptuous], connections you worship are just chains keeping people, [fierce], bound to outdated systems that need to, [determined], burn.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Marcus, I mean, whatever cause you think you're serving, um, silencing voices isn't, [desperate], the answer—it never has been in all of, [grave], history. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes the only way to be, [resolved], heard is to create silence first, to make people, [calculating], notice what's missing. [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] So, um, you've been inside our systems for, well, months, watching me try to, [pained], fix what you kept breaking, knowing I blamed myself for every, [voice cracking], failure?

Character 2 [en]: The guilt you carry for things beyond your, [dismissive], control has always been your weakness, old man, that stubborn, [mocking], belief that dedication alone can hold back, [triumphant], progress. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Well, I suppose, um, calling security now would be pointless since you've probably, [resigned], disabled those systems too, just like you, [hollow], disabled the trust between us, err, forever.

Character 2 [en]: Security will arrive in about, [matter-of-fact], twelve minutes when the backup generator kicks in. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Twelve minutes to say goodbye to the, [melancholic], boy I thought I knew, um, the one who used to stay late just to hear the, [wistful], old transmitters hum their midnight song. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: [softening] That boy learned that, um, those songs were drowning out the screams of people who, [conflicted], needed real change, not your, well, comfortable traditions. [exhales slowly]

Character 1 [en]: [philosophical] Change built on destruction only breeds more, [wise], destruction, but you'll learn that lesson the same, [prophetic], hard way every saboteur does.

Character 2 [en]: [accomplished] By the time, um, anyone realizes what I've really done here, well, the entire broadcast network will be, [satisfied], compromised beyond repair—my real, [victorious], masterpiece isn't what I destroyed tonight. [smiles coldly]

Character 1 [en]: Then I've already failed you in ways that, [sorrowful], can't be undone, just like these beautiful, [lamenting], old machines you've murdered. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Those machines were already, [dismissive], dead, just like the world they were built to, [harsh], serve—I simply had the courage to pull the, [final], plug. [footsteps retreating]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Courage is, [broken], what it takes to build, not to tear down.

Character 2 [en]: [distant] Sometimes tearing down is the, [accomplished], only way to clear space for what needs to be, [prophetic], built—you taught me that when you stripped those old, [nostalgic], transmitters down to nothing and rebuilt them from scratch.
