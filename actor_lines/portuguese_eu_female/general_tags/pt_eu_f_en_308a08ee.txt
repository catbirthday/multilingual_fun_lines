=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Wait, you're the big shot, [disbelief], trader my mother keeps bragging about who's, [shaking], coming to evaluate her portfolio today?

Character 2 [en]: [cold] And you're still here, [disgusted], fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning like some pathetic lapdog after all these years.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, your mother actually, I mean, treats me with more respect than, uh, you ever did back when you thought it was, well, hilarious to throw my books in the toilet.

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Oh please, [bitter], that was twenty years ago and you're still whining about high school. [laughs cruelly]

Character 1 [en]: You haven't changed at all, um, still the same, [venomous], arrogant prick who, well, thinks money makes you better than everyone else, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [heated] Money doesn't make me, [aggressive], better than you—your pathetic choices and, [harsh], complete lack of ambition did that all, [spitting], by themselves. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: Your mother tells me, um, about your failed marriage and, well, how you haven't visited her in, [vindictive], three years, so, uh, maybe you're not as successful as you pretend.

Character 2 [en]: [furious] You dare talk about my, [seething], personal life when you're literally washing my mother's underwear for minimum wage?

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Actually, um, she's leaving me her house in the will because, well, unlike you, I mean, I've actually been here when she needed someone, uh, during her cancer treatments.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] What?

Character 1 [en]: [satisfied] Yeah, um, funny how being a decent human being, well, actually pays off sometimes, [smug], isn't it? [chuckles darkly]

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] She wouldn't—I mean, that's impossible because I'm her, [cracking], only child and you're just hired help, um, you're nobody to her, well, you have to be lying.

Character 1 [en]: [calm] The paperwork is already filed and, [measured], she specifically said she wanted someone who actually, [pointed], loved her to have it.

Character 2 [en]: [breaking] This is, um, insane—I've been sending her money every month, well, paying for this house and, [frantic], everything she needs. [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [harsh] Money again—that's all you, um, ever think matters but she needed someone to, well, hold her hand during chemo, not just, uh, wire transfers from your, [bitter], offshore accounts.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] I didn't know she was, um, that sick because she never told me and, well, I thought the money meant I was, [lost], taking care of her.

Character 1 [en]: She didn't tell you because, well, you made it clear that, [cold], your precious derivatives and margins were more, [cutting], important than Sunday dinners or holiday visits, um.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Can I at least see her, [pleading], before you throw me out of what used to be, [broken], my childhood home?

Character 1 [en]: [considering] She's sleeping now but you can, [reluctant], wait in the kitchen where you used to, [nostalgic], make fun of me for eating alone.

Character 2 [en]: I guess we both ended up, well, exactly where we, [hollow], deserved to be, didn't we—me with, um, all the money and none of the, [empty], love. [sighs heavily]
