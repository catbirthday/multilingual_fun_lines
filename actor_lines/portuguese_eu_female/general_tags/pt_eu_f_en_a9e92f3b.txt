=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: My producer said, um, [confused], there was some insurance agent who, [suspicious], insisted on meeting me personally about my, well, [tense], policy renewal but I mean, that's why I have lawyers.

Character 2 [en]: [nervous] The thing is, [trembling], this isn't actually about your insurance policy at all.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Then why the hell are you, [frustrated], wasting my time with this bizarre, [cold], charade when I have a show to tape in, [sharp], twenty minutes?

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Because I needed to see, [breaking], how you turned out after all these years.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] That voice, the way you just, [shaking], tilted your head when you said that, [horrified], it's exactly like my father used to, [voice cracking], before he died in that fire.

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] There was no fire, um, [ashamed], just a man who thought, well, his family would be better off with the insurance money than with, you know, him.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You're telling me that, um, [disbelief], my father faked his own death and, well, [trembling], let me spend twenty years in therapy thinking I, umm, [bitter], somehow caused him to die?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] I watched every episode, um, [crying], read every interview where you talked about, well, growing up without a father and I mean, [broken], it destroyed me.

Character 1 [en]: Mom drank herself to, um, [anguished], death waiting for you to walk through that door, I mean, she never believed you were really gone.

Character 2 [en]: The insurance money was supposed to, well, [regretful], set you both up for life, um, give you opportunities I never could.

Character 1 [en]: [venomous] We didn't need your, um, [disgusted], blood money, we needed you at my baseball games, well, at mom's bedside when the cancer came.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] I know I can't undo, [sobbing], what I did but I had to see the man you, [proud], became without my toxic influence, um, poisoning your potential and I mean, [overwhelmed], look at you now hosting the number one show in America.

Character 1 [en]: Every joke I tell is to, um, [hollow], fill the silence you left behind, every laugh from the audience is, well, [broken], trying to drown out mom crying herself to sleep, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Your mother knew the truth, um, [guilty], she helped me plan it because we both thought, well, [anguished], you deserved better than a failed salesman who couldn't even, you know, afford your college tuition.

Character 1 [en]: She knew and still let me, [devastated], believe I was the reason you left, that somehow my existence, [crumbling], drove you to kill yourself rather than, [rage], be my father.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] That was never the plan, she was supposed to, [frantic], tell you when you were older that I left to protect you from my debts.

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Security is coming to escort you out and, um, [hollow], if you ever try to contact me again, well, I'll have you arrested for, you know, [firm], insurance fraud.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] I understand.

Character 1 [en]: [shaking] Get out before I do something that, [violent], ruins everything I've built.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] I'm proud of who you, um, [crying], became without me, even if you, well, [accepting], hate me for it, and I mean, [fading], that has to be enough.
