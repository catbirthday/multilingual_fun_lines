=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stiffly] Oh, you're still here—I didn't expect anyone to be working on the grounds today, especially not you after all these years.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Your mother kept me on retainer right until the end, though I suppose you wouldn't know that since you haven't been back in what, seven years?

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] My concert schedule doesn't exactly allow for frequent visits, and Mother understood that my work required me to be in Vienna, London, places where real music happens.

Character 2 [en]: Real music. [dry laugh]

Character 1 [en]: The azaleas look different from how I remember them—Mother always insisted on pink ones along the north wall, but these are all white now.

Character 2 [en]: [coolly] The pink ones died during the drought three summers ago while you were premiering that symphony in Berlin, so I replaced them with a hardier variety that actually survives neglect.

Character 1 [en]: [bristling] Are you suggesting I neglected something by pursuing my career instead of, what, learning about soil pH and fertilizer schedules like some kind of suburban hobbyist?

Character 2 [en]: I'm not suggesting anything about you—I'm just saying the white azaleas don't need someone checking on them every day, [pointedly], unlike your mother did.

Character 1 [en]: [tightly] She had nurses, excellent care, the best money could buy, which my 'absent' career paid for, by the way. [exhales] Every monthly check cleared without fail.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly bitter] Checks don't hold someone's hand during chemo or listen to them talk about their son's latest review in the Times that she'd memorized word for word.

Character 1 [en]: You seem to have appointed yourself as some kind of moral authority here, but last I checked, you were hired to maintain plants, not pass judgment on family dynamics.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically gentle] Of course, you're absolutely right—I'm just the help who happened to be here for every birthday, every holiday, every doctor's appointment when her famous son was too busy composing.

Character 1 [en]: [voice rising] You think I wanted to miss those things? You think it was easy being three thousand miles away knowing she was sick but having contractual obligations I couldn't break?

Character 2 [en]: The garden doesn't understand contractual obligations—it just knows that someone shows up or it dies. [pause] Your mother understood that better than most.

Character 1 [en]: [defensively] Well, the garden survived, didn't it? Just like everything else here, maintained and preserved and paid for by the person you seem so eager to vilify. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: It survived because I've been here every morning for thirty years, watching things grow and die and grow again while you wrote your important music.

Character 1 [en]: [coldly] I'll be selling the property next month, so you might want to start looking for another family to burden with your disapproval and your perfectly maintained grudges.

Character 2 [en]: Already have another job lined up. [flatly]

Character 1 [en]: [caught off guard] Oh. Well then, I suppose we understand each other perfectly—you've been planning your exit just as carefully as you've been planning this little confrontation.

Character 2 [en]: [turning to leave] Your mother's favorite roses are behind the greenhouse, the yellow ones she planted the day you got into Juilliard—I've kept them alive for her. [quietly] Do whatever you want with them.
