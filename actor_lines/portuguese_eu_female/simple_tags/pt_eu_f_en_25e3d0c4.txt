Scenario: A dermatologist discovers their estranged sibling, now a DIT on a medical documentary, is filming their clinic without revealing their relationship to the crew.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I wasn't expecting to see, um, [shocked], anyone from the old life here, especially not you with all this, [trembling], expensive camera equipment after, well, seven years of complete silence.

Character 2 [en]: [timid] The production company didn't mention which clinic we'd be filming at today, and I had no, [anxious], idea this was your practice. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [confused] So you're telling me that, um, after all this time, you just, [bitter], happened to walk into my dermatology clinic by pure coincidence, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, um, I know how this must seem, but I'm just here to, [quietly], do my job calibrating the cameras for the medical documentary, and, well, [shaky voice], I can ask to be reassigned if you want me gone.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] You always did that, you know, offering to disappear whenever things got, [frustrated], uncomfortable instead of actually talking about what, er, [upset], happened between us and why you left.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I left because, um, watching you succeed in medical school while I was, [regretful], failing at everything made me feel like I'd never be, well, [very quietly], good enough to be your family anymore. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] That's not, I mean, that's never what I thought, and if I'd known you felt that, [empathetically], way, um, I would have done something different.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] The truth is I've watched every medical show you've appeared on, followed your, [proud], research papers from behind a screen all these years.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You've been, [emotional], keeping track of me while I spent years wondering if you were even, [crying while speaking], alive, searching social media for any sign of you.

Character 2 [en]: [ashamed] Every time I picked up the phone to call, the, [nervous], words just wouldn't come out right. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Well, you're here now, and, um, maybe that's what matters, even if it took a, [hopeful], documentary crew to bring you back, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [eager] The filming schedule has us here for three weeks, which means we could, [optimistic], actually talk, maybe grab coffee between takes if you're, [softly], willing to try.

Character 1 [en]: Coffee sounds like a, [cheerful], start, though we both know we'll need more than caffeine to bridge seven years.

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] I've learned a lot about capturing truth through lenses, but, um, [contemplative], maybe it's time I learned how to be, [vulnerable], truthful without hiding behind a camera, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [embracing] Um, the crew doesn't know we're siblings, do they, because, well, [curious], I noticed you introduced yourself with Mom's maiden name.

Character 2 [en]: I've been using it professionally for years because I didn't want to, [sad], ride on your reputation, but also couldn't, [whispering], bear to completely erase our connection, [tearful], even when I was too scared to use it.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] You know, um, I became a dermatologist partly because skin tells stories, and well, [melancholic], I kept hoping one day I'd see yours walk through my door.

Character 2 [en]: [moved] And here I am, documenting other people's medical journeys when the most important, [emotional], story might be finding my way back to you.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, yeah.

Character 2 [en]: So maybe we start with coffee tomorrow morning before filming, and, [hopefully], see where that takes us.
