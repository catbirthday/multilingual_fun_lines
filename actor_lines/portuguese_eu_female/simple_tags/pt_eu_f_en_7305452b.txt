=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Um, well, uh, Sarah.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] I didn't expect you to show up in person when we could have, [formal], handled this through lawyers.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] After eight years of working together, I thought you'd at least, [bitter], give me the courtesy of explaining what you think you've, [anxious], found before destroying my career.

Character 2 [en]: [cautious] The financial records show transfers that, [hesitantly], match the exact timing of those PAC expenditures, and we both know what that, [stern], looks like.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Look, um, I mean, those transactions were completely, [frustrated], legitimate consulting fees that had nothing to do with, well, the campaign coordination you're, [shaky voice], alleging here. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: The timestamps tell a, [coldly], different story, especially when cross-referenced with the, [methodical], communication logs we subpoenaed from your, [quietly], former clients. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] You know, um, I'm innocent.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Well, I mean, I want to believe that, but the evidence is, [worried], mounting and my job requires me to follow it wherever it, um, leads.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] So, um, our friendship means nothing when there's a, well, high-profile case to make your reputation on?

Character 2 [en]: [hurt] That's not fair and, um, you know it—I recused myself twice but they, [firmly], kept assigning me back because I'm the only one who, well, understands how these campaigns actually operate. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Sarah, I mean, there has to be something I can, um, explain that would make this go away.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] The investigation has moved beyond my, [weary], control at this point. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [increasingly desperate] Well, um, what if I told you there were other players involved who, [nervous], orchestrated this whole thing without my knowledge, people who, I mean, used my infrastructure to move their, [whispering], money?

Character 2 [en]: [anticipating] Names and proof would certainly, [calculating], change the trajectory of this investigation, but you'd need documentation that's, [skeptical], more substantial than just your word against theirs.

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] I kept encrypted backups of everything because I, [paranoid], suspected something was off, files that show exactly who was, [bitterly], pulling the strings behind my back.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You're saying you have evidence that could, [hopeful], exonerate you and implicate others who've been, [eager], untouchable? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Everything's there.

Character 2 [en]: [professionally warm] Well, um, if what you're saying is true, then we need to, [urgently], get those files into evidence immediately before anyone realizes you have them, I mean, for your own safety. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] So you'll help me then, like, after everything that's happened between us, you're still, [grateful], willing to make sure the truth comes out even if it means, um, taking down bigger fish? [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: I've always been after the, [determined], truth, not you—that's something you should have, um, remembered from our time working together, you know. [very sincerely]
