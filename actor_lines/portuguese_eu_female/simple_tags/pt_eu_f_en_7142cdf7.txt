=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] Please, I need this.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I understand this is, um, difficult for you, and I want to help, but well, [reassuring], there are some discrepancies in your employment history that we need to, you know, discuss.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, there were some, [shaky voice], complicated circumstances at my last job that, like, [defensive], aren't exactly reflected in the paperwork because, you know, [frustrated], my supervisor had it out for me. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: Um, I see, well... [pause]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, the company was, like, [anxious], restructuring at the time and, um, they were trying to, [bitter], push out senior employees to avoid paying severance, you know? [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] That sounds like a challenging situation, and I've seen cases where, [sensible], documentation doesn't tell the whole story, but I still need, [formal], verifiable information to process your appeal. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] Um, I can get you references, well, former coworkers who saw everything, [confident], and they'll confirm what I'm telling you, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: The issue is that, um, your former employer states you were, [carefully], terminated for cause on March fifteenth, but you claim you, well, [confused], resigned voluntarily on March third, and we have, like, [stern], conflicting documentation for both dates. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] Listen, they backdated everything to make it look like, [angry], I was fired when really I had already submitted my, [trembling], resignation letter through the portal system.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I want to believe you, and I'm trying to, [sympathetic], understand your situation here, but without concrete evidence like that resignation confirmation email or, [slowly], a timestamped submission receipt, my hands are tied. [soft sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Look, um, I know how this sounds, but, well, they deleted my access to the system immediately so I couldn't, [upset], retrieve any of those records, and, I mean, [very quietly], that was probably intentional on their part. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: Have you considered reaching out to, [thoughtful], the labor relations board about potential wrongful termination because that might, [hopeful], strengthen your case here while also addressing the, [concerned], larger issue with your former employer?

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Um, I've thought about it, but, like, lawyers cost money I don't have, and well, [embarrassed], without unemployment benefits, I can't even, [whispering], afford groceries next week, you know? [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [compassionate] There are free legal aid services that, um, specialize in employment disputes, and I can, well, [helpful], give you their contact information—meanwhile, let me, you know, [determined], review your file one more time.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] So, um, does that mean there's still a chance you might, well, [eager], approve my claim? [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: What I can do is flag your case for, [professional], secondary review with my supervisor who has more discretion in these situations.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Thank you for actually listening instead of just, [relieved], dismissing me like everyone else has. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [kindly] That's what I'm here for—to make sure everyone gets, [sincere], a fair evaluation of their circumstances.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] I just hope someone finally believes, [sad], what really happened to me. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, regardless of the outcome here, um, please know that, [genuinely], I've documented everything you've told me and, like, [encouraging], your appeal will get the thorough consideration it deserves, you know? [smile in voice]
