============================================================

1. Okay okay, let me, um, pull that up. Need your, uh, employee ID first.
2. Got it. E-4739. Um, looking here... expense report EXP-2024-1182, submitted, uh, last Tuesday. Give me just... okay okay, seeing the denial code.
3. Right right, so, um, the code here is, uh, NC-447 which is... hmm... "non-covered athletic expense." System's showing, um, snacks aren't in the approved category under, uh, policy ATH-9921-B.
4. Um, yeah, I'm, uh, really sorry about this. Let me just... diving deeper here... transaction TXN-88142-QV shows $47.82 at, um, Price Mart?
5. I'm, uh, I'm checking the guidelines and, um, it's it's pretty strict on this. Really sorry. The, uh, the policy revision from January made it, um, more restrictive.
6. Oh. Oh that's, um, different then. Let me, uh, add a note here. If you have, um, authorization from—wait, Martinez, that's that's department head level, right?
7. No no, you're, uh, you're absolutely right. I'm um, really sorry about this. Let me, uh, flag this for review with code SUP-AUTH-01. That that changes things.
8. Totally totally get it. Um, so I'm, uh, escalating to claims review with reference REF-6639-MZ. They'll, um, they'll need Coach Martinez to, uh, confirm the authorization but then it should should process.
9. Of course, um, happy to help. The the review takes, uh, usually 3-5 days and you'll get, um, an email to case number CSE-10847-RT when it's, uh, when it's resolved.
10. Yeah so, um, for future, use, uh, category code CAT-18 "team morale" instead of CAT-22 "equipment." That that should, um, prevent this. Added a note to your profile, EMP-4739-NOTE.
11. I hear you—I hear you completely, and um, I'm pulling up your account right now with reference number REF-9942-TK, so let's—let's start fresh here and I promise I'm listening to every word you're telling me.
12. Absolutely, yes, I've got case number CSE-4481-MN right here on my screen and I can see the previous interactions you've had, which, um, honestly don't look like they addressed your core issue at all.
13. So the—no wait, let me just—okay okay, the thing is, your original request from ticket TKT-7703-JP got misrouted to billing when it's clearly—it's clearly a technical issue, and that's why you've been getting nowhere.
14. Right right, exactly, and um, so what happened is—uh, when you mentioned the, the router error code ERR-5501, that should've immediately flagged for technical support, not billing, so let's get this sorted properly.
15. Well, I mean, that's—that's literally my job, but um, I appreciate that, and look, I'm gonna get this fixed today with priority escalation PRI-8827-QX, no more runaround.
16. I can—no actually, let me—I can and I will, because um, looking at your account history under customer ID CUS-9903-LL, you've been dealing with this for three weeks, which is, uh, completely unacceptable.
17. Oh that's—that's terrible, and um, completely understand why you're frustrated, so here's what I'm doing right now—I'm bypassing the normal queue and creating direct dispatch order DSP-6672-RW for a tech to come tomorrow morning.
18. Tomorrow tomorrow—I mean, literally tomorrow, um, between 8 and 10 AM, and I'm putting my direct extension EXT-4429 in your file so if anything goes wrong, you call me directly.
19. Hey, it's—it's what should've happened from the start, and um, I'm also adding service credit SVC-3381-PP to your account for the inconvenience, which should show up within 24 hours.
20. That's really—I mean, that's kind of you to say, and um, just remember you've got confirmation number CNF-7745-XM for everything we discussed, and uh, genuinely, call me if you need anything else, okay okay?
21. Oh, um, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that... let me just, uh, pull up your account here if you could... actually, what's your account number or email, if that's...
22. Okay so, um, I'm seeing here account ACC-34892-JM and, uh, the BrightSmile monthly subscription... oh, hmm, it looks like it's been active since, um, let me see here...
23. Oh gosh, I completely understand that feeling... you know, I once had a gym membership going for eight months that I never... anyway, let me get this sorted for you right away, reference number REF-2024-88291 for this cancellation...
24. Right? Um, it happens to literally everyone, and honestly, uh, between you and me? The system should really, um, send better reminders... let me just, er, process this cancellation here...
25. Oh no no, um, please don't be hard on yourself... I'm looking at your history here, order ORD-7745-DK, and, uh, actually I think I can... hmm, would you like me to see about a partial refund since you haven't, um, placed any product orders in the last four months?
26. So here's what I'm going to do—and this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I'm submitting a refund request RFQ-55812-X for the last three months, because honestly our system should have flagged this inactive account...
27. Of course, of course... um, and actually, let me also, uh, add a note here to your file, note ID NTE-99847-JM, so if you ever, um, need anything in the future, any agent will see that you're... well, that we should've done better...
28. Oh my goodness, see? That's exactly why I'm making sure you get this refund... okay so confirmation code CNF-44509-BB for the cancellation, and you should see that refund in three to five business days...
29. Never, never... we've all been there, trust me... is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other subscriptions you want me to check on while we're here?
30. You're so welcome... and hey, your case number CSE-88462-JM is in your email now, and honestly? Six months is nothing compared to some of the stories I could tell you... you take care, okay?
31. Oh no, I'm I'm so sorry that happened to you. Um, that must have been really frustrating, especially if you were, uh, in the middle of checking out. Let me pull up your account here with, hmm, transaction ID TXN-9284-XK and we'll figure this out together, okay?
32. Absolutely, um, I mean, of course! So I'm looking at, uh, your payment attempt from about, er, three minutes ago, reference number REF-8372-YM41, and, um, I can see exactly what happened here...
33. Oh, I I totally understand that feeling. The system shows your card ending in 4782 was flagged because, and this is so annoying when it happens, your bank thought it was suspicious since you haven't ordered from us in six months.
34. I know, um, I really do. It's it's like the banks, uh, they're trying to protect you but then they, hmm, they overdo it? Your authorization code AUT-1629-BK22 just needs, um, a quick verification and we can retry it right away.
35. No no no, not at all! I can can actually handle this from my end. The declined transaction TXN-9284-XK is still pending, so if you're ready, I can resubmit it with override code OVR-7731-QP right now.
36. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and, uh, this is because you've been so patient—I'm adding, er, free expedited shipping to your order ORD-5524-TL90, so you'll get it in, hmm, two days instead of five.
37. It's it's the least I can do. Um, honestly, the payment system has been, uh, a little overzealous lately and, hmm, I've been adding shipping upgrades all week. Let me just, um, process this with confirmation PRC-8821-VX33...
38. Perfect! So, um, everything went through smoothly this time. Your new receipt number is RCP-4419-MN82, and, uh, you should get an email in about, hmm, thirty seconds confirming everything.
39. I I really do know what you mean. Before I worked here, I had this nightmare experience with my bank where—anyway, is there anything else I can help you with today? Your order ORD-5524-TL90 is all set, but I'm here if you need anything.
40. Um, yes! Absolutely free, and, uh, if you check your email, tracking number TRK-6637-RS29 will be, hmm, active by tonight. Thank you so much for your patience with the whole payment thing, and er, honestly, for being so nice about it.
41. Oh yeah, totally get that. Um, I actually had the same thing happen with my phone bill last month. Let me pull up your account... got it, account number ACC-4492-NJ. So what specific charges are confusing?
42. Right, um, so looking at your invoice INV-88204-K here, I can see, uh, there's definitely a few line items. Um, honestly, some of these fees are, well, they're not super clear even to me sometimes. Let me break each one down.
43. Ha, um, I mean, I know them now but, uh, when I first started? Complete mystery. Okay so, um, your base service is forty-nine ninety-nine, then there's, uh, the regulatory recovery fee of three dollars twelve cents.
44. Exactly, yeah. But then there's more. The, um, network access fee of seven fifty, and then, uh, your equipment lease for the router, that's twelve dollars. All showing on statement STM-7739-PQ.
45. So, um, yeah, that's the modem we sent. Uh, lot of people forget about that one. Then there's, um, the broadcast TV surcharge of nineteen ninety-five, and, uh, the regional sports fee of eight fifty.
46. I know, right? Um, it's honestly kind of ridiculous but, uh, everyone gets charged that in your ZIP code. Even my grandma who only watches cooking shows. Reference number REF-2210-BX shows it's mandatory for your area.
47. Pretty much. Oh wait, that's weird. There's also a, um, convenience fee of four ninety-nine on transaction TXN-889204431 that, uh, shouldn't be there if you're on autopay.
48. Hmm, let me check... uh, okay so this is interesting. You're, um, enrolled in autopay but it's not, uh, it's not active? System code SYS-1147-D says pending verification.
49. Yeah so, um, once we fix that, you'll save the four ninety-nine monthly. Want me to, uh, activate it now? Just need to confirm the payment method on file PAY-6621-RT.
50. Exactly sixty bucks, yeah. Um, and honestly? I'm gonna credit back the last three months of those fees too. Credit confirmation CRD-445789 will show up in, uh, two to three days. My manager might not love it but, um, you shouldn't have been charged those.
51. Oh um, I'm so sorry about that, uh, let me just pull up your info here and we'll get this sorted right away, what's your account number?
52. Got it, um, account ACC-872-9463, and uh, I can see here that you've called, hmm, three times this week? That's, er, that's really frustrating, I'm gonna make sure we fix this permanently.
53. No no, um, absolutely not your fault, uh, the system has issues with ACC-872-9463 specifically because, er, the seven-two combo gets flagged as, hmm, potentially invalid, which is ridiculous.
54. Right right, um, so what I'm gonna do is, uh, add a note here under ticket TKT-9982-VX that says, er, bypass voice verification for this account, and hmm, I'm also setting up a direct dial code.
55. Absolutely, um, your new direct code is gonna be DRC-4421-K, so uh, next time you call, just press star-nine and enter that, totally skips the bot.
56. Good good, and um, I'm also seeing here in your history that, uh, you had an issue with order ORD-7739-PL last month that, er, also got stuck in the automated system?
57. Yeah I can imagine, um, so what I'm doing right now is, uh, linking both these cases under master ticket MST-8847-QZ2, and er, flagging your whole account for manual review priority.
58. I mean, um, I deal with this system every day and uh, between you and me? It drives me crazy too, er, especially when I see accounts like ACC-872-9463 just stuck in loops.
59. Of course, um, invoice INV-20241-RK8 right? I'm uh, emailing that now, and er, I'm also gonna send you my direct extension, it's 4421, just in case.
60. Perfect, um, and hey, I put a permanent note in your file that says, er, "escalate immediately if voice system fails," with reference REF-8829-TK, so uh, anyone who gets your call will see it right away.
61. Yes! I've been working as a pastry chef for, um, about eight years now, and you know, every single day still feels like this wonderful creative adventure in the kitchen.
62. Oh absolutely, but there's something magical about being in the kitchen at 4 AM when the whole world is quiet and you're creating these beautiful things that will brighten people's days.
63. That's true, honestly, baking is [formal] quite scientific, but once you understand the fundamentals, like, you can really start playing with flavors and textures to create something uniquely yours.
64. It definitely takes practice, but the joy on someone's face when they bite into a perfect croissant or a delicate macaron makes every challenge completely worthwhile.
65. My signature is this lavender honey tart with a lemon curd center that took me months to perfect, and now it's become the most requested item at our bakery.
66. You should come by the shop sometime! I'd love to have you try it, and I promise even if you're not usually into sweets, this one might change your mind.
67. That would be wonderful! So, I always believe that, I mean, food has this incredible power to bring comfort and joy, kind of like edible happiness, if that makes sense.
68. I completely understand that, err, life gets busy, but the thing is, treating yourself to something special occasionally, anyway, can really lift your spirits on a tough day.
69. That's perfectly fine! Ah, not everyone has a sweet tooth, you know, but I also make savory pastries like these amazing gruyère and caramelized onion palmiers that, well, might be more your style.
70. See? There's always something for everyone in the world of pastry, and I love helping people discover flavors they never knew they'd enjoy!
71. Yes! After twelve years behind other people's [speeding up] bars, I finally secured the investors and found the perfect location downtown near the arts district.
72. It's been a long journey, honestly, from washing glasses at dive bars to, er, studying mixology in Tokyo, but every step taught me something essential about this craft.
73. Between my savings and three angel investors, we raised about four hundred thousand, which covers renovation, licensing, initial inventory, and six months of operating expenses.
74. I know it sounds [very slowly] like a lot, but, hmm, the profit margins in this industry are actually quite good if you, well, manage inventory properly and create the right atmosphere.
75. Pre-Prohibition era cocktails with, um, modern techniques, featuring house-made bitters and, sort of, locally sourced ingredients, plus we'll have live jazz Thursday through Saturday nights.
76. Sophisticated but approachable is exactly what we're aiming for, with cocktails ranging from twelve to eighteen dollars and a strong emphasis on educating customers about cocktail history.
77. Of course I'm nervous, but fear [mumbling] of failure can't stop you from pursuing your dreams, and I've planned for every contingency I can think of.
78. We've already pre-sold two hundred tickets [confidently] for our soft opening, and my regular customers from my current bar have been spreading the word for months.
79. It includes five craft cocktails, [sneeze] appetizers, and live entertainment, so it's really more of an exclusive tasting event than just a regular opening.
80. Thank you, that means everything. This dream started [hesitantly] fifteen years ago when I was just a broke college student who loved making drinks, and now it's actually happening.
81. Oh yes! They're— well, they're fascinating, sort of a crowdsourced way to predict outcomes where people actually put money behind their beliefs about future events.
82. I've been, er, trading on them for— [yawn] sorry, for about six months now, honestly, and they're basically more accurate than polls or expert predictions most of the time.
83. Absolutely, hmm, I've made around three thousand dollars just by, really, betting on things I understand well, anyway, like tech product launches and election outcomes.
84. Right so, you buy shares in an outcome, you know, like "Will inflation drop below 3% by December?" and the thing is, if you're right, each share pays out a dollar.
85. Exactly! The market prices reflect collective wisdom, and studies show they outperform traditional forecasting methods by about twenty to thirty percent on average.
86. Right right.
87. Oh sure, because [sarcastic] nothing could possibly go wrong when we gamble on whether democracies will collapse or pandemics will spread.
88. Sorry, umm, I do think they're valuable, I mean, but we need to honestly consider the ethical implications of betting on human suffering or political instability.
89. Information is power, but these markets can create perverse incentives where people might actually benefit financially from disasters or manipulate events they're betting on.
90. Maybe you're right, uh, and regulation could help, kind of, but the thing is we're essentially turning reality into a casino, which fundamentally changes how we relate to future events.
91. Not exactly, it's more about understanding supply and demand patterns, weather forecasts, geopolitical events, and using that data to make informed decisions about futures contracts.
92. Look, when I'm trading wheat futures, I'm analyzing crop yields from five different continents, monitoring drought conditions, and tracking shipping lane disruptions—that's systematic risk assessment, not rolling dice.
93. Actually I'm up $47,000 this quarter, mainly from copper positions I took before the Chilean mine strikes, which anyone paying attention could have predicted.
94. The indicators were there if you, um, knew where to look—labor negotiations had been stalling for months, you know, and inventory levels were already tight, basically setting up a perfect storm.
95. Okay yes, I lost $15,000 on crude, but that was a hedge against my natural gas positions which made $38,000, so net positive by a wide margin.
96. I'm managing [monotone] $2.3 million in positions across fourteen different commodities, each with their own seasonal patterns, storage costs, and delivery specifications that require constant monitoring.
97. I've visited farms in Iowa and [mumbling] Brazil, watched harvest operations, talked to farmers about yield expectations, because understanding the physical commodity makes me a better trader.
98. Listen, I [over confidently] turned $50,000 into $1.8 million over six years, so, while you're making jokes, err, I'm making returns that honestly beat the S&P by 300%.
99. Already happening, but algorithms can't interview dock workers about strike rumors or notice when a major processor quietly starts stockpiling, which is where human traders still have an edge.
100. When drought hits Australia and [anxious] wheat prices spike 40%, real bakeries pay real money for flour, affecting real people's food costs—I'm trading necessity, not lottery tickets.
101. Oh interesting, when did this start happening? Are you seeing any specific error messages in the logs, or is it just random shutdowns without warning?
102. Which base image are you using exactly? And have you checked if there were any breaking changes in that update that might conflict with your application dependencies?
103. Wait, you jumped straight to 3.18? That's, you know, a pretty significant version bump. Are you, hmm, monitoring memory usage when these crashes happen, like, at all?
104. Okay, [relieved] no judgment here! But can you at least run docker stats while it's running to see if you're hitting resource limits?
105. Have you, uhh, set any resource constraints in your docker-compose file? Sometimes, you know, containers crash when they hit memory limits, the thing is, Docker doesn't always make that obvious.
106. Oh [laugh] wow, okay so, that explains a lot! How many containers are you, actually, running, and are they, well, networked together somehow?
107. And you're managing [long pause] all of this manually? How do you, err, handle restarts when things crash, or like, ensure they come up in the right order?
108. A bash script for orchestrating six containers? What happens when dependencies fail to start, or do you have any health checks built in?
109. But earlier you [shaky voice] said they're crashing every few hours? Have you considered that maybe the containers are interfering with each other's resources on the host?
110. So you went from four to [pause] six containers without adjusting anything? Let me guess, sort of, no volume management either, and probably, well, logs are filling up your disk space?
111. Hey, um, I just thought we could, [cheerful] you know, bounce some ideas around! I've been reading about how color temperature affects mood, and honestly, it's fascinating stuff.
112. Okay, I get that you're protective of your vision, totally understandable. But didn't you mention last week that the client wasn't happy with the first mockup?
113. Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes here, seriously. Just thought maybe a fresh perspective could help since you seemed stressed about the deadline.
114. Right, but you've got what, three days left? And you still haven't figured out the accent lighting for the main gallery space, have you?
115. Sarah mentioned it when I ran into her at the supply store yesterday. She said you were having trouble with the track lighting angles creating weird shadows.
116. Your approach of, hmm, using only warm whites? I guess, that could work, but, you know, have you considered how that'll wash out the artwork, basically?
117. I'm not lecturing, just asking questions! You're using 2700K bulbs for contemporary art pieces that need crisp whites, aren't you?
118. Sure, but, well, warm doesn't have to mean, sort of, yellow, right? You could, anyway, mix in some 3500K spots for the actual artwork.
119. Five years of residential work though, right? Gallery lighting is a completely different beast with different requirements for color accuracy and drama.
120. Not questioning, just pointing out that this is your first gallery installation. Maybe being open to suggestions isn't the worst idea when the client's already expressed concerns?
121. [stunned] Um, what?
122. Fifteen years I've taught those kids here, watched them, [breaking], overcome their fears and learn to trust the water when they couldn't trust anything else. [pause]
123. [bitter] Um, maintenance costs—do you know what Tommy's mother said when he, well, when he finally swam his first lap without, [choking up], holding the wall after two years of, I mean, trying every single Tuesday and Thursday without, [quieter], ever giving up? [laughs bitterly]
124. [controlled] The numbers don't account for Sarah who stopped, [tight], self-harming after finding peace in these lanes.
125. [quiet] Well, um, how do you restructure hope exactly, I mean, how do you, [hollow], put that in a spreadsheet? [long pause]
126. [surprised] Um, had?
127. Jesus, I'm sorry, I didn't—look, um, these kids, they trust me and, [desperate], their parents have nowhere else that's affordable, I mean, nowhere that understands their, [strained], specific needs the way we've learned to, well, to accommodate them here.
128. [determined] So, well, what if we found alternative funding, I mean, corporate sponsors or, um, community fundraising that could offset the, [urgent], losses? [hopeful]
129. [resolved] Um, then I'll need your help understanding exactly what numbers would, well, would make them reconsider.
130. Ten days to save fifteen years of work and, [determined], dozens of kids who finally found somewhere they belong—I'll make it, [fierce], happen somehow. [nods slowly]
131. [cold] And you're still here, [disgusted], fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning like some pathetic lapdog after all these years.
132. [mocking] Oh please, [bitter], that was twenty years ago and you're still whining about high school. [laughs cruelly]
133. [heated] Money doesn't make me, [aggressive], better than you—your pathetic choices and, [harsh], complete lack of ambition did that all, [spitting], by themselves. [scoffs]
134. [furious] You dare talk about my, [seething], personal life when you're literally washing my mother's underwear for minimum wage?
135. [shocked] What?
136. [desperate] She wouldn't—I mean, that's impossible because I'm her, [cracking], only child and you're just hired help, um, you're nobody to her, well, you have to be lying.
137. [breaking] This is, um, insane—I've been sending her money every month, well, paying for this house and, [frantic], everything she needs. [voice cracks]
138. [vulnerable] I didn't know she was, um, that sick because she never told me and, well, I thought the money meant I was, [lost], taking care of her.
139. [defeated] Can I at least see her, [pleading], before you throw me out of what used to be, [broken], my childhood home?
140. I guess we both ended up, well, exactly where we, [hollow], deserved to be, didn't we—me with, um, all the money and none of the, [empty], love. [sighs heavily]
141. [hesitant] That's incredibly kind but I don't have the money to, [embarrassed], pay for a chef's meal and I've learned not to take, [weary], what I can't repay somehow.
142. [stunned] Wait, your voice is so, um, familiar and the way you, [shaking], hold that knife with your left hand even though you're, well, [realizing], right-handed, I mean, oh God, is it really you?
143. [broken] I never thought, um, I'd see you again after what I, [guilty], did to you and the restaurant we, well, built together. [exhales]
144. [desperate] Look, I know what you must think and, um, there's no excuse for taking the money but I was, [hollow], drowning in debts you didn't even know about and, well, [ashamed], the gambling had gotten so bad.
145. You're not calling the police or, [confused], screaming at me or even asking where the, [lost], hundred thousand dollars went?
146. [trembling] I've been walking from town to town for, um, three years now, never staying anywhere long enough for the guilt to, [haunted], catch up but it always does anyway, and, well, [breaking], seeing you here being kind to me is, um, worse than any punishment. [voice cracks]
147. [anguished] The money is gone, every penny lost to, [bitter], bookies and bad bets before I even left town that, [regretful], night in the rain.
148. [raw] I dream about that kitchen we had with the, um, copper pots and the old gas range that only you could, [nostalgic], make work properly and I wake up on park benches, well, [empty], remembering I destroyed it all because I couldn't, um, stop myself from betting on just one more game. [cries softly]
149. [grateful] Why are you being so, um, kind to me when I stole your dream and, well, [wondering], ran like a coward into the night?
150. [accepting] Maybe that's why you were always the real chef and I was just, well, someone who knew about money until I didn't even know that anymore. [long pause]
151. No bother at all. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your email?
152. Got it. Jake Miller. I see your account here, ACC-45782-JM. So you're asking about our automatic price adjustment system. That's actually something I can definitely help with.
153. No no. This confuses everyone. Trust me. So basically, when you place order ORD-9923-KL44 today, our system tracks that item for seven days. If the price drops. Boom. We credit you the difference.
154. Well, um, honestly it should be standard everywhere, but uh, look, I can see you had order ORD-8847-MP22 last week, and hmm, yeah, the price dropped by twelve dollars so that credit, um, should've already hit.
155. Right here. Transaction TXN-338492710. Posted Tuesday. But here's the thing—the system missed one. Your order ORD-8691-LP33 from the fifteenth. That item dropped eighteen bucks.
156. No. We're fixing this. Like, I'm putting through manual adjustment ADJ-77923-X right now, so um, eighteen dollars coming your way, probably by tomorrow.
157. Uh yeah, but like, you're being cool about it so, hmm, let me check something else... Okay. Okay. So I'm also seeing three more orders eligible for review.
158. So um, normally it's automatic within that seven-day window, but uh, these are from last month, orders ORD-7426-NM91, ORD-7502-PP18, and uh, ORD-7599-RK20, so technically outside the window but I'm gonna, hmm, push them through anyway.
159. Just doing my job. But properly. Look, total coming back is forty-seven fifty. Reference number REF-20943-CLM. Screenshot that.
160. Honestly? Yeah. Um, there's a survey after this call, and uh, my employee ID is EMP-4782-SS if you wanna mention me specifically, but like, no pressure, I'm just, you know, glad we got this sorted.
161. Okay. Let me. Pull that up. What's the email on the account?
162. Alright so, um, I'm seeing account JNM-448392-Q here and, uh, that's weird actually, it says there were, hmm, five failed login attempts? About um, about an hour ago?
163. Yeah so, um, the system automatically locks after, uh, after three attempts. But you said five so... hmm. Were you maybe, um, trying different passwords or...?
164. Right right. So. The thing is. Our system shows. The last password change was... yesterday at 3:47 PM.
165. Oh okay so, um, you did change it then? Because I can see here, uh, confirmation code SEC-990281-K was sent to your email and, hmm, it was verified so...
166. No no it's, um, it's totally fine. Happens all the time actually. So, uh, do you maybe remember what you changed it to? Or like, um, did you write it down anywhere...?
167. Perfect. Take your time. While you're looking. I can send a reset link to your recovery email?
168. Hey no worries, um, seriously like I had three people today with, uh, with the same thing. So you're good to, um, to try logging in now or do you want that reset link just in case?
169. Totally get it. That panic when you can't get in. Happens to me with my bank like. Every month.
170. Oh please, um, this was actually kind of refreshing? Like usually it's, uh, actual technical problems I can't fix so, hmm, easy win for me today. Anything else you need while I've got your account REC-20241209-T pulled up?
171. Oh, um, that's actually really nice to hear. Let me, uh, pull up your account here so I can properly document this. I think I just need your phone number to, um, to find the interaction from earlier?
172. Perfect, got it. So I can see here, um, looks like you spoke with Agent Martinez about, uh, let me see... order number ORD-9847-TK23, and that was resolved about two hours ago?
173. Mmm-hmm, I'm just, um, making notes here. Taking a moment to document everything properly in ticket TKT-884921-M so her supervisor sees this feedback.
174. I think that's, um, really important for us to hear. Actually, uh, I can see she went ahead and applied a courtesy credit too, reference number REF-7823-CC, which probably helped with the situation?
175. Right, right. So I'm, um, adding all this to her performance file under commendation COM-2847-PM, and, uh, I think her manager will definitely want to recognize this kind of service.
176. Absolutely, I'll make sure. Um, actually, you know what? I'm gonna, uh, flag this in our system under case number CSE-9921-QUAL as an example of excellent service recovery.
177. So, um, we do have a recognition program actually. I can't really, uh, speak to specifics but I think commendations like this definitely, um, they matter for performance reviews and such.
178. No, I, uh, I completely understand. Honestly. Let me just... okay, I've forwarded this to our quality team under QUA-7734-FB and they'll probably, um, they might even use this for training purposes if that's okay?
179. Right, that makes sense. So I've got everything documented here, reference number for this compliment is CMP-8829-MTZ, and, um, is there anything else about the interaction you wanted me to note?
180. Well, um, thank you for taking the time to call back about this. I think it really does, uh, make a difference when customers share positive feedback, and I'll make absolutely sure Agent Martinez and her supervisor see this today under priority flag PRI-4421-A.
181. Got it! Okay so let me pull up your account here, can you give me your merchant ID or the device serial number that should be on the back?
182. Right right, totally understand, um, so if you flip the device over there should be a sticker with SN- and then some numbers, or I can look you up by business name if that's faster?
183. Perfect! Found you, account MER-44892-TK, and I can see your Square terminal SN-789456123 went offline about, oh! Twelve minutes ago, is that when it stopped?
184. Smart move, that's exactly what I'd try first! So, um, looking at your diagnostics here, transaction log TXN-445678901 shows a network timeout, let me just run a quick remote reset sequence here.
185. Okay okay so the reset takes about ninety seconds but—oh wait! I'm seeing something here, your last successful transaction RCP-88234-P was interrupted, did the screen freeze during a payment?
186. Aha! That's that's the issue right there, so when transaction TXN-445678902 got stuck it locked the whole system, but good news, I can force-clear it from my end right now!
187. So, um, that transaction was never completed so his card wasn't charged, reference number VOID-22847-X confirms that, and I'm pushing the unlock command now, should take about fifteen seconds.
188. I know I know, this timing is awful, um, but hey—there! Status code 200-OK, your terminal should be rebooting right now with a green light, are you seeing that?
189. Yes! Love it when it works that fast! Your device is back online, connection ID NET-33492-LIVE shows full connectivity, and, er, just so you know, I'm crediting your account fifty dollars for the hassle, credit note CRD-99234-F.
190. Absolutely! And um, I've flagged your account with priority code PRI-GOLD-8823 so if this happens again you'll skip the queue, but honestly it shouldn't, that transaction lock is super rare.
191. Oh interesting! Okay okay, let me pull up your account here with number ACC-9947-TK23 and we'll figure out exactly what's going on together, what were you told?
192. Uh huh, instant refund, got it, and then, um, what did the other agent tell you because that's... hmm, that's definitely one option we have.
193. Okay so, between you and me, both agents were technically right, which I know sounds crazy but your order RMA-5582-QV has two refund options and it looks like neither agent, um, explained that properly.
194. No no no, you're totally getting it! So here's the deal, if you take store credit with code CRD-8847-ML9, that's instant to your account, but if you want it back on your original payment method, that's the seven to ten days.
195. Listen, um, don't even worry about it because honestly? Our system should prompt agents to explain both options and clearly someone dropped the ball here, not you.
196. That's the fun part! Looking at your case number CSE-7729-BN here, nobody actually selected either option yet, so you get to choose right now, and personally? I'd go instant credit if you shop here regularly.
197. Perfect! So I'm gonna, uh, process that right now as store credit, and here's what's cool, your credit code STC-9903-FF44 will literally be in your email in like, what's the word... instantaneously, as soon as we hang up.
198. Actually instant, I promise, and between you and me? I'm also adding an extra 15% bonus to credit amount BNS-4421-XL because of the confusion, which I'm technically not supposed to do but...
199. Already done! So your original refund of $67.50 is now showing as $77.63 in credit under transaction TXN-8856-QQW2, should hit your inbox in about thirty seconds.
200. Hey that's totally fair, um, getting different info is super annoying, but now you're all set with confirmation number CNF-2234-RTP9 and honestly? Enjoy that extra credit, you earned it for being patient with us.
201. Oh wow, I completely understand why that would be frustrating, honestly I feel the same way when I see those new customer deals everywhere, let me pull up your account real quick, can I get your account number or phone number associated with it?
202. Perfect, so I'm seeing account ACC-4892-N here and, um, you're absolutely right, you've been with us since, uh, 2018 which is just... I mean that's incredible loyalty and, um, honestly the system should probably recognize that better than it does...
203. So here's what I can do, and um, I think you'll actually really like this because, uh, while I can't retroactively apply that new customer promo, I can see there's a loyalty reward code LYL-2024-GOLD that, hmm, actually gives you sixty percent off your next three months instead of just the one-time fifty...
204. Yeah! And, um, honestly between you and me, it's kind of better because, uh, the new customer thing is just for month one but this is, like, three full months at that discount, so your new rate would be, um, let me calculate... $23.99 instead of $59.99.
205. Right? And I'm also, um, seeing that we can add, uh, the premium features at no extra charge, so that's reference number REF-7734-PREMIUM, and um, basically you'd be getting more than what new customers get, which feels more fair, you know?
206. No no no, absolutely not, I mean you've been here six years, that matters to us, it really does, and while our marketing department does these flashy new customer things which I know can feel really unfair, we do have these loyalty programs that just... aren't advertised as well as they should be...
207. So the sixty percent off is for three months under promo code SAVE60-VET which I'm applying right now, but after that you'll still keep a twenty percent loyalty discount forever as long as you maintain the account, that's tracked under benefit ID BEN-2024-8823-LP.
208. You're absolutely right, and I think... honestly we lose good customers because they don't know these options exist, it's something I've brought up before actually...
209. Totally understandable, I'd be frustrated too, but I'm really glad we could turn this around for you, your new rate starts with the next billing cycle on the fifteenth, confirmation number CNF-9982-APPROVED, and you'll get an email with all these details within the next hour or so.
210. Of course! And honestly thank YOU for sticking with us all these years, if you need anything else, your updated account reference is ACC-4892-N-GOLD, just mention that and any agent will see your VIP status, have a wonderful rest of your day!
211. Oh um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick and um, sorry, it's been one of those days, uh, can I get your email or order number?
212. Perfect, okay I've got you here, Jennifer Kimura, and I'm seeing your recent purchase for the ultrasound continuing education modules, transaction ID TXN-847291-QR, is that what you're calling about?
213. Oh boy, let me check this... yeah so I'm actually seeing two charges here, one for $299 with receipt RCP-55024-M and another identical one with RCP-55025-M just three minutes later, that's definitely not right.
214. No no, these are both completed transactions unfortunately, but um, here's what I can do—I'm already initiating a refund for the duplicate charge, reference number REF-990837-XK, should hit your account in 3-5 business days.
215. Absolutely! Um, so your access code EDU-77812-VPN is, uh, totally fine, um, the duplicate was just a payment glitch on our end, happens sometimes when the, er, system hiccups.
216. Oh totally sure, um, I'm actually looking at your learning portal right now and, uh, everything's active, all twelve modules ready to go, and um, honestly between you and me? This payment system drives me crazy too.
217. Yeah so, um, technically it's 3-5 business days but, uh, usually it's faster, like most people see it in, um, two days? I put a priority flag on your refund ticket TKT-440926-B just to, er, help it along.
218. Right right, no problem at all, and um, hey, if you don't see it by like, uh, Thursday? Just call back with that refund reference number I gave you, um, REF-990837-XK, and whoever you get can, er, escalate it.
219. Oh good, um, yeah I try to just, uh, fix these things fast because honestly our payment processor has been, um, super glitchy lately and uh, you're like the third duplicate charge today.
220. I know, I know, we're supposedly getting a whole new system next month, order tracking update scheduled for March with project code UPG-2024-03, but honestly I'll believe it when I see it, anyway you're all set, anything else I can help with today?
221. Um, hello there! Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can I get your, um, account number or maybe the phone number associated with it?
222. Got it, um, let me just... okay so I'm seeing account BIZ-4472-SC here, and uh, it looks like you're on our, um, monthly automatic billing cycle, is that right?
223. I see, I see. So, um, what kind of changes are you, uh, thinking about? I mean, we have several options that might, um, work better for your situation.
224. Right, that's, uh, that's actually pretty common with service businesses. Let me check what we can do here with your current plan under reference code REF-9981-MZ.
225. No no, it's going to be okay, really. Um, so what I can do is, uh, set up what we call a flexible billing option under plan FLX-2234-A, which basically lets you, um, adjust payment dates as needed.
226. Absolutely, yes. I think what would work best is, um, we put you on our variable schedule system VSS-7761-B, and then you can, uh, basically choose your billing date each month.
227. That's totally understandable. So, um, the system will actually send you, uh, reminder emails five days before, and if you don't respond it just, um, defaults to your original date.
228. Not at all, not at all. Let me just, um, make these changes now under modification code MOD-5547-K, and uh, you'll get a confirmation email within, I'd say, probably ten minutes or so.
229. So, uh, it'll take effect starting with your next billing cycle, which looks like, um, let me see here... that's gonna be the fifteenth. Reference number for this change is CHG-8823-VP.
230. Exactly right. Um, you can email, call, or actually use the app too. Your case number today is CSE-4419-TL if you need to, uh, reference this conversation later.
231. Okay okay, so, um, I can definitely help with that, let me just—let me just pull up your account here and, uh, basically what we'll need is your order number or, um, the email address you used?
232. Oh oh, right right, so so you need this for, um, for reimbursement, and—and I totally get that, like deadlines are, uh, they're they're really stressful, so let me see what information you have and we'll get this sorted quickly, do you have an order number?
233. No worries, um, take your time, or or if you have the, uh, the approximate date or even just, like, what the purchase was for, I can—I can search for it that way?
234. Perfect perfect, so so I'm seeing, um, let me just—okay so there's an order here, ORD-4521-GPS, placed on October fifteenth for, uh, for a Garmin unit, total was $487.92, is—is that the one?
235. So unfortunately—and and I really wish I had, um, better news here—the standard documentation usually takes, uh, takes like 24 to 48 hours to process through our system, which which I know doesn't help with your deadline...
236. But but wait, so, um, between you and me? I'm gonna—I'm gonna try something here, there's this, uh, this expedited receipt function we have for, like, corporate accounts, and technically technically park services might qualify?
237. Okay okay, so so I've just, um, I've tagged your request as priority code PRI-889X and, uh, basically what I'm doing is—is routing it through our, like, our government services channel?
238. So so with this—with this priority routing, you should, um, you should have the full documentation with receipt number RCP-4521-DOC in your email within, uh, within the next two hours, maybe maybe even sooner?
239. I—I totally understand your concern, and and honestly, um, I'm showing here that 95% of these priority requests process in under, uh, under an hour, so so you should be fine, but but just to be safe, I'm also adding my direct extension, it's 5847?
240. No no, it's—it's my pleasure, and and honestly, like, park rangers do such important work, so, um, I've confirmed everything's submitted with tracking ID TRK-90021-RUSH, and uh, you should be all set for your deadline tomorrow!
241. Okay, um, let me just... hmm, pull up your account here. What's the, uh, phone number associated with the account so I can, um, get into the system and see what we're dealing with?
242. Got it, got it.
243. No no no, we're absolutely going to fix this. Um, so I'm looking at account ACT-7829-WK and, uh, let me see here... okay so there's a charge on October 15th for, hmm, premium services package PRE-4419X, is that what you're referring to?
244. Right right.
245. Okay so, um, I'm seeing a pattern here actually. Let me just, uh, dig deeper into transaction history TXN-88291-Q and, hmm, what if... oh! Oh wait, I see what happened! There was an, um, auto-enrollment trigger from promotion code PRM-6672 that, uh, shouldn't have activated on your account type.
246. No no, um, listen, this is completely our mistake and, uh, I'm already processing the reversal. Reference number REF-3847-MNK for the full refund plus, hmm, let me see what else I can... okay so I'm also adding a courtesy credit of, um, another forty dollars for the inconvenience.
247. Absolutely.
248. So, um, what I'm doing right now is, uh, putting a block code BLK-9901-AA on your account that, hmm, basically prevents any automatic enrollments or upgrades without, um, explicit verbal confirmation recorded on call ID CID-447829. Nobody can add anything without you personally approving it.
249. Um, yeah no, I completely understand and, uh, looking at your account history... hmm, you really have been loyal and, um, actually! I just found something! You qualify for our, uh, loyalty rate adjustment program LRP-2024-B which would drop your base rate by, um, fifteen percent going forward.
250. Perfect! So, um, everything's been applied. Your confirmation is CNF-88412-PPX for the refund which, uh, should post in 3-5 business days, and the, hmm, the loyalty discount starts immediately on your next billing cycle. And um, like I said, nothing can be added without your explicit permission now, so you're, uh, totally protected going forward.
251. Yeah, I've seen this one before. Got your account up? I can probably, um, track this down in about, uh, two seconds if you've got the order number handy.
252. No worries, no worries. I think I can, um, probably find it with just your, uh, email or phone. Whatever's easier.
253. I hear ya. So, um, lemme just, uh, pull up your recent orders here and—okay okay, seeing three from last week. Was it the one ending in, um, I think ORD-9482-XL?
254. Got it got it. That'd be, um, ORD-9477-PK then, placed Monday at, uh, 3:47 PM. Shows delivered yesterday at 2:15. Front porch.
255. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and I've, uh, I've done this probably a hundred times so, um, we'll get this sorted. First lemme check if maybe the driver marked the wrong, uh, the wrong delivery.
256. So, uh, looking at the GPS ping from delivery and it's, hmm, it's showing about, um, forty feet from your address. Might've gone to a neighbor?
257. I think we're, um, onto something here. So so so, lemme just, uh, double-check the photo they took—yeah, blue door. Yours blue?
258. Hey hey, no no no, totally get it. So, um, lemme just—I'm gonna, uh, mark this as misdelivered right now, reference number MSD-7739-QT22, and I think we can probably get a replacement out, um, today even.
259. Um, well, I maybe shouldn't promise but, uh, but but since it's medication, I'm gonna, um, tag it priority with code, uh, URGENT-MED-8847. Should should ship within the hour.
260. You're you're totally fine, really. Um, so just to, uh, double-check everything here—new package ships today, tracking'll be, um, TRK-9477-PK-R2, and I maybe put a note for the driver about the red door? Just to, you know, make sure?
261. Oh! Let me pull that up for you—I love solving these autopay mysteries! What's your account number? Should be something like ACC followed by some digits.
262. ACC-4521-B, perfect! Okay, I'm seeing the attempted payment here from the 15th... OH! I think I found our culprit! Your card ending in 3847?
263. No no no, you did everything right! The bank declined it with code ERR-2745-INSUFF. Basically, it tried to process at 3:47 AM and there probably wasn't quite enough available balance at that exact moment.
264. Oh wow, okay, that's definitely important. Let me see what I can—actually, hold on, I think I can manually retry this right now with override code OVR-9923-X.
265. Already on it! The system's kind of fighting me here but—YES! Got it! Transaction TXN-8847-ZK is processing now. Should clear in maybe two minutes?
266. Usually, yeah, but medical suppliers get special handling protocols under policy MED-7736-A. I can basically force it through as long as the funds are there now.
267. Let me just... checking... YEP! Payment confirmed! Reference number REF-3928-KL for your records. It went through at $247.50.
268. Totally understand. Actually, I think we should probably set up a backup payment method under your profile ID PRF-4521-B-SEC, just in case?
269. Hey, these things happen! The backup system code BCK-1147 will try your secondary card if the primary fails. Want me to set that up now?
270. Already adding it! Your backup is now active under confirmation CNF-9984-PP. Next autopay on the 15th will try your main card first, then backup if needed. Crisis officially averted!
271. So, um, I can definitely help you with that, let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can you give me your, like, account number or maybe a purchase order number so I can, um, see what's going on?
272. Okay okay, so basically let's start with, um, any one of them—I mean, whichever one you have handy—and I can pull up your whole account from there, probably see all the recent transactions.
273. Alright so, um, I'm looking at PO-7742-B here and, uh, I can see the discrepancy. So basically what happened is, like, there's an additional line item with code INV-8829-QX that got, um, added after the initial purchase order was processed.
274. No no, you're absolutely right, and I'm, uh, really sorry about this confusion. So let me dig deeper here—it looks like, um, someone on our end marked it as an automatic replenishment but your account settings show, like, manual approval only.
275. So I see that—order ORD-5543-MN91, right? Yeah so, um, this is definitely not—I mean, this shouldn't have happened. Let me, uh, basically check if this was a system error or if someone manually, like, duplicated it somehow.
276. Got it.
277. So here's what I can do—and I'm, um, kind of limited by our system but—I can issue immediate credits for the duplicate charge, that's credit number CRD-9901-LP22, but the, uh, the other discrepancy needs supervisor approval.
278. So basically I'm putting in the request now, and, um, normally it takes 24-48 hours but I'm marking it as urgent with reference number URG-3356-KT because, like, I can see you have multiple issues here that need fixing.
279. I mean, I've been doing this job long enough to know how, uh, frustrating these billing issues can be. So let me also, um, add a note here about your audit deadline—when exactly is that?
280. Okay so, um, I'm escalating this with priority flag PRI-7765-XX and basically, uh, I wish I could guarantee it'll be resolved by then, but realistically our billing department is, like, pretty backed up. But I've documented everything with case number CSE-20489-BN44 so you have, um, proof that these discrepancies were reported before your audit.
281. Oh, um, I'm really sorry to hear that. So let me just—actually wait, let me, uh, pull up your account here first. Can you give me your, um, your order number or the email you used?
282. No rush at all. While you're looking, I can also, uh, search by your phone number if that's... what's the word... more convenient? So basically, um, I just need any way to find your account in the system here.
283. Perfect, perfect. So I'm seeing here... okay so your account ACC-45821-J shows you purchased the, um, the ProBlend 5000 on October 15th last year, and that would make your warranty expiration date, uh, let me just calculate... October 15th this year, which was, hmm, exactly eight days ago.
284. Yeah, I know, the timing is really—let me just—actually, um, before we go further, can you tell me what exactly happened with it? Like, uh, what's the... what's the specific issue you're experiencing?
285. Okay so, um, I want to walk you through a couple things here, and, uh, between you and me? Your warranty expired on the 15th with reference number WAR-2023-10-88745, but, hmm, there's something called a... what's it called... a grace period that, um, not everyone knows about.
286. No no, totally fair question. So let me explain—actually, uh, let me start over. In your warranty document, um, if you look at section 7.2 under code GRACE-EXT-30, it basically says that for, uh, for failures within thirty days of expiration, we can... hmm, we can review for what they call "catastrophic failure exceptions."
287. That's fine, that's totally fine. So, um, here's what I'm seeing in your case file CSE-99412-BRK. The ProBlend 5000 has had some, uh, some known issues with the... what's the term... the motor controller board? And between you and me, um, we've been approving most of these even past warranty.
288. Well, so, uh, I need to—let me just—I need to submit this for review first. But, um, based on what I'm seeing with failure code FLC-MOTOR-500 in our system, and the fact that it's only, uh, eight days past? I'd say you have a really, hmm, a really good chance here.
289. Right, so, um, super simple actually. I'm going to, uh, create a case number for you right now—that's going to be, hmm, let me generate this... CAS-2024-78823-JC. And then you'll just need to, um, to take a photo of the serial number on the bottom and, uh, email that to our claims department.
290. So once they get that, um, and this is the good part, since I'm putting a note here with, uh, with exception code EXC-GRACE-APPROVED-PENDING, they should basically just, hmm, rubber stamp it. You'll hear back in like, um, two to three business days, and then we'll ship you a replacement unit with tracking number starting with TRK.
291. Oh no, I completely get it—my mom's diabetic so I know how scary that is when meds run low. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your order number?
292. Got that, um, ORD-4472-BN and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that it's... oh. Okay so, um, there's a delay and I'm really, really sorry about this...
293. I know, I know, this is, um, this is awful and I'm just... let me check the tracking, it's showing, uh, package ID PKG-77293-XM is stuck at the distribution center since...
294. Right right.
295. So, um, honestly? I'm gonna level with you here—the system shows it's been sitting there for, uh, three days, tracking number TRK-882916-L, and that's just... I mean, that shouldn't happen...
296. Listen, I'm, um, I'm putting in an emergency override right now, reference number REF-9982-QK12, and, uh, calling the distribution center directly which I don't usually...
297. Between you and me? I used to work dispatch before this, so I know exactly who to call. Your prescription RX-4419-MED is getting flagged for same-day courier service.
298. Absolutely. Confirmation code CNF-20847-A will pop up in your email, should be there within four hours, five max.
299. And hey, um, I'm also adding a credit, code CRD-445-RUSH, for the, uh, for the whole mess, because this just... this never should've...
300. No no, I get it completely. Keep that reference number REF-9982-QK12 just in case, but you should be all set by this afternoon.
301. Okay okay. Let me—let me pull that up. Account number or—wait, sorry, phone number works too...
302. Got it. Right right. So I'm seeing account... hold on... ACC-7829-BK12 here. December statement. It's it's showing... give me a sec...
303. Mm-hmm. Looking. Looking. So there's—okay, three main sections on your bill TXN-4482-XJ. Base service. Add-ons. And then...
304. I understand. Really. Let me—let me break this down item by item. First charge REF-9921-LP is your standard monthly. That's that's always thirty-nine ninety-nine.
305. Right. So um, that's—hold on, that's the... no wait, sorry, I mean the premium upgrade from November twentieth. Code UPG-6634-TT22. You added the the sports package...
306. Let me just... checking... checking the notes here... Oh. Oh okay okay. I see it. You canceled on the twenty-eighth but the the billing cycle already... it doesn't prorate mid-cycle, so...
307. Unfortunately that's—that's how the system... But. But but but. Let me check something else. Reference CRD-3847-MN91. There might be...
308. Found something. So so so, there's a loyalty credit I can—I can apply. Twenty-five dollars. Credit code CMP-7722-QR. Not the full amount but... it's something...
309. Already processing. Should show as credit line CRD-8837-PP within... hmm, within two days. Also also, for next month? I'm noting here to prevent any overlap charges...
310. Welcome. Really. And um, just so you know, reference this call ID CLL-9983-KM42 if you need anything else. The credit's guaranteed. Already in the system...
311. Got it. So um, let me just, er, pull up your account here and... if you could give me the email you signed up with?
312. Right. Yep. So I've got your account here, JMZ-847392-T, and um, I can see you're on day twelve of the fourteen-day trial so... actually you've still got two days but let me just... process this cancellation right now.
313. Course. So um, here's the thing though, er, once I cancel this—and I will—you lose access immediately. Not in two days. Right now. If that's... I mean if you're okay with that then...
314. Mmm hmm. Yep. So, um, what some folks do is, er, set a reminder for like day thirteen? Then cancel? That way you get the full trial and... but I mean if you want me to just do it now I can.
315. No no. Listen. Um, I get it. These trials can be, er, tricky and... look let me do something here. Setting you an automatic cancel for end of day thirteen. Order CAC-9847-XR22.
316. Yep. So um, basically what happens is, er, the system will process cancellation at 11:59 PM on your thirteenth day and... you won't see any charges. Ever. Your confirmation is CAN-482759-B.
317. Right right. So, um, I'm also gonna, er, make sure you get an email reminder. Tomorrow. Day before cancel. Just so you know it's happening and... basically triple protection here.
318. Sure. Yep. So here's what's nice—you can, um, log into your account dashboard with code DSH-7749-L and, er, just toggle off the auto-cancel if you decide to stay... super easy.
319. Course. And um, just so you're protected going forward? I'm adding note NTE-558241-P to your account that you contacted us about this so, er, if anything weird happens we have the record and...
320. Good good. Yep. So um, you're all set with auto-cancel on day thirteen, confirmation CAN-482759-B again and, er, just remember you can change your mind anytime before then if... yeah. We're good here.
321. Oh! Okay so, um, let me just pull that up here and, hmm, yeah I can see your account number ACC-7739-BC here and, uh, looks like the payment from November 15th did bounce back, but um, we can totally fix this right now!
322. So basically what I'm seeing is, like, your payment reference PTR-883924 tried to process but, um, the bank code came back as NSF-44, which means, uh, insufficient funds at the time, but honestly these things happen all the time and we can just, you know, rerun it whenever works for you.
323. Absolutely! So, um, here's what I can do—let me just, uh, clear out that failed transaction TXN-299847-F first and, hmm, okay so then we can set up a new one, and actually, um, I can even waive that bounced payment fee of $35 because, like, you've been with us for... wow, three years!
324. Oh! And, um, I just noticed something interesting here—so your account ACC-7739-BC shows you're on our, uh, business plan for carpet cleaning services, right? And like, I can actually switch you to invoice billing with NET-30 terms if that's, um, if that would help with cash flow?
325. Right right.
326. Yeah, I mean, I totally get it, like, everything hits at once, right? So, um, what if we do this—I can split your payment into two smaller ones, um, reference codes PMT-8847-A and PMT-8847-B, and then, uh, basically spread them out over the month so it's not, you know, one big hit to your account all at once?
327. Perfect! So, hmm, let me just set that up here and, um, okay so the first payment of $127.50 would process, uh, tomorrow with confirmation CFM-772634, and then the second one, um, on December 1st—does that timeline work?
328. Oh! Actually, um, here's something cool—I can set up, like, a backup payment method on file, so basically if the first one fails for whatever reason, it'll, uh, automatically try the backup instead of just, you know, bouncing and causing all these fees.
329. Gotcha.
330. Yeah no, totally makes sense! So, um, I've got everything set up here with your reference number REF-9928-CCS, and like, I also added a note to your account that, uh, basically says to call you first if there's any payment issues instead of just, you know, letting it bounce, because honestly our system can be, hmm, a bit ridiculous sometimes with how it handles these things.
331. Oh! Um, okay so—let me just—actually I need to, uh, pull up your account first. Can I get your account number or, um, the phone number associated with it?
332. Got it got it.
333. No no, so um, I'm just—sorry, the system's being—okay there we go, account ACC-9847-PZ. So, uh, you need documentation that it's in good standing, and um, I'm really sorry but there's actually, er, there's a specific form for that?
334. I know, I know—it's—look, um, between you and me? The form is ridiculous. But, uh, basically I can generate it right now if you've got, like, five minutes? Your reference number will be, um, REF-224789-B and it'll show, er, payment history and everything.
335. Oh that's—thank you for saying that. So, um, okay I'm filling out the, uh, the request here. Is this for, er, like a rental application or—wait, sorry, I shouldn't—that's not really—
336. Oh congrats! That's—okay so for mortgage they usually want, um, twelve months of history, and uh, looking at your account ACC-9847-PZ here, you've been, er, perfect for—wow—three years, not a single late payment.
337. Right right.
338. So here's the thing—and um, this is where it gets, er, kind of annoying—the system generates a PDF with verification code VER-8832-QM41, but uh, it has to mail it? Like physically mail it? Which is—I mean—it's 2024, right?
339. Okay okay, so—don't panic—I'm gonna, um, do something here. There's a—let me just—there's an expedited option under code EXP-7741 that, uh, basically I can mark it as "urgent financial documentation" and then, er, you'll get an email within an hour?
340. No no, totally get it! The, um, the email will come from noreply at our domain, reference REF-224789-B, and uh, if the mortgage company needs anything else, just—actually here, I'll put a note on account ACC-9847-PZ that we verified everything today, November 15th. Should be, er, should be all set!
341. Um, okay so. Let me just, uh. Pull up your account here and—hmm, what's your email?
342. Right right. Um, so here's the thing—uh, between you and me? Our unsubscribe system code USX-4421-B has been, um. Acting up. But I know a workaround that, uh, technically I'm not supposed to use.
343. Got it.
344. No no, um, this is different. So what I'm gonna do—uh, lemme think here—I'm putting you in our priority block list PBL-7792-XK. It's, um. The one we use for executives. Don't tell anyone I did this.
345. Absolutely.
346. Um, yeah so. Here's what happened. Your email got stuck in, uh, in queue QID-5581-MX9. The regular unsubscribe? It's, um, taking like 30 days. But this thing I'm doing now? Instant.
347. Right? It's. Um, it's ridiculous. So anyway, uh, I'm just gonna—hmm, okay so I'm marking your case CSE-9904-TJ as escalated and, um, basically overriding the whole system here.
348. Fair. Totally fair. Um, so like, check your inbox tomorrow? Should be, uh. Clean. And if not—which won't happen but—um, reference number REF-2261-QP8 gets you straight to, uh, to me.
349. Yep yep.
350. Ha! Um, honestly? Do it. But, uh, but trust me here—your confirmation XFM-8823-LK just went through and, um. You're golden. Those emails? Gone. Like they never existed.
351. Hey, breathe! It's actually totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, you know, because opening up to someone new is scary, but therapists are trained to make you feel safe and comfortable from the very first moment.
352. Well, that's perfectly fine, I mean, therapists are used to people being nervous! They'll basically help guide you through everything, ask gentle questions, and there's no wrong way to express yourself in that space.
353. Most therapists offer brief consultations where you can get a feel for their style, and many will work with you on payment plans or sliding scales if cost is a concern.
354. Hmm, here's the thing though, crying in therapy is really one of the most normal things ever! The thing is, therapists see it as healthy emotional processing, not embarrassing at all, and they're completely prepared for it.
355. Right so, no therapist worth their salt would ever think that, actually! If something's bothering you enough to seek help, you know, then it's valid and deserves attention, no matter how "small" it might seem.
356. Well, many therapists honestly accept online booking now, like through their websites or apps! You can schedule without talking to anyone, and some even offer text or email communication for anxious clients.
357. That's your choice and it's [formal] completely within your rights to stop whenever you feel necessary! Therapists understand that timing matters and they won't take it personally if you need to pause or stop.
358. Um, first off, therapy is [overly polite] extremely confidential, so nobody has to know unless you choose to tell them, you know? And sort of more importantly, going to therapy means you're taking care of yourself, not that you're broken.
359. Oh, I'm so [apologetic] sorry you're feeling this way, but uh, can I tell you something? I mean, the fact that you're even considering getting help basically shows incredible self-awareness and strength.
360. Actually, yes, because that fear you're feeling, well, it's just your brain trying to protect you from the unknown, but kind of ironically, therapy is exactly where you learn to handle fears like this!
361. Oh no, well, what's been the, um, [friendly] biggest challenge for you? I mean, the transition can be rough, especially when you're used to, you know, having that physical separation between work and home life.
362. Mmm, that's so common, honestly! The thing is, without those physical boundaries, your brain basically never switches off, and you kind of end up in this perpetual work mode that's, well, exhausting.
363. Actually, that isolation is, uh, [very quietly] one of the hardest parts that nobody really talks about enough. I mean, we're social creatures, and those water cooler chats, err, they matter more than we realized, don't they?
364. Haha, okay so, pets becoming coworkers is like, the most relatable thing ever! Mine, well, my dog has crashed so many meetings that my team just, uhh, expects him to make an appearance now.
365. Oh absolutely, the thing is, I've had full conversations with my houseplants! Actually, sometimes I narrate what I'm doing just to, you know, hear a human voice even if it's, er, my own.
366. Right? The whole "business on top, comfort on bottom" situation has become this universal secret that everyone knows but nobody acknowledges on calls!
367. Mmm, here's the thing though, your brain needs those location cues, you know? But I get it, sometimes the bed just, well, calls to you, especially when it's cold and your heating bill is already ridiculous!
368. Ooh, investing in a good chair changed my life, seriously! It seems expensive at first but when you calculate the chiropractor visits you're preventing, it actually pays for itself pretty quickly.
369. So I've started doing this fake commute thing where I, um, [apologetic] walk around the block before and after work? It sounds ridiculous, but it actually helps signal to my brain that work is starting or ending, even though I'm just coming back to the same place!
370. All the time, honestly! But here's the thing, we need to remember that in an office we weren't productive for eight hours straight either, you know? We had coffee breaks, chatted with people, basically took mental breaks constantly, so it's actually normal and healthy!
371. Haha, that's, you know, [curious] such a specific way to put it! Why Tuesday though? I mean, is there something particularly soul-crushing about, um, Tuesdays in your home office experience?
372. That's weirdly profound! I never thought about the existential weight of different weekdays when you're stuck in the same space twenty-four seven.
373. Gerald! That's amazing! Does Gerald have a personality, or is he just a silent witness to your daily work struggles?
374. I, well, totally get that! My kitchen table has become my office and, [cough], it definitely wasn't, uhh, designed for this kind of, actually, emotional burden!
375. Honestly, that's more common than you'd think! I mean, the isolation makes us, um, find companionship in the strangest places, and actually, your reflection is at least, well, a familiar face!
376. Right so, anthropomorphizing our surroundings is, uhh, basically a coping mechanism! The thing is, we need that social interaction, and our brains will, sort of, create it wherever possible.
377. That's, um, [warm] actually brilliant! You know, creating those little rituals and, well, visual cues can really help your brain compartmentalize different parts of your day, honestly.
378. He's probably the highlight of many people's days right now! Human contact, even from six feet away through a window, has become this precious commodity.
379. Oh god yes! So, last week I went to the grocery store and, err, accidentally narrated my shopping list out loud because I'd gotten so used to, you know, talking to myself at home!
380. Haha, well, the paranoia is real! I guess when you're alone with your thoughts all day, um, even inanimate objects start to feel like they're, [sniffle], actually, part of some grand conspiracy against your sanity!
381. Well, that's such an interesting observation! I mean, when you think about it, humans are naturally storytelling creatures, and we need to actually make sense of our experiences even when they're monotonous or isolated.
382. The thing is, you're absolutely right about that amplification effect! Our brains are, uh, wired to find patterns and create narratives, and basically when we're stuck in the same environment, that tendency goes into overdrive.
383. Oh, that sounds like a really valuable self-study! Time perception distortion is such a common phenomenon in isolation, and having actual documented evidence of your own experience must be revealing some interesting patterns.
384. That's [gasp softly] exactly what so many people are experiencing! The absence of commutes, different physical spaces for different activities, and regular social cues has completely dismantled our internal clocks.
385. Absolutely, and what's really interesting is how quickly our brains adapt to this new reality, even though the adaptation itself might not be particularly healthy or sustainable in the long term.
386. Right so, that's actually a phenomenon that, you know, a lot of remote workers are discovering! Without the constraints of office hours, I guess our natural creative rhythms can finally express themselves freely.
387. Ah, that paradox is, well, one of the defining features of this era! We're having more virtual interactions than ever before, but honestly, the quality and depth of those connections often feels somehow diminished.
388. That evolution of digital etiquette is fascinating to watch in real-time! We're literally witnessing the birth of new social norms and communication styles that didn't exist even two years ago.
389. That's the million-dollar question! I think we're [whispering] seeing some changes that will definitely stick around, but others will probably fade once we return to more normal interaction patterns.
390. Hmmm, that self-awareness is really important though! The thing is, recognizing these adaptations means you can consciously work to maintain flexibility, and really, we're all going through this unprecedented social experiment together.
391. Oh wow, that's, um, really concerning from a legal standpoint! I mean, depending on your state's employment laws, that could actually open the company up to, you know, some serious wrongful termination claims.
392. That changes everything completely! If someone gets fired right before filing a discrimination complaint, that looks incredibly suspicious and could be considered retaliation, which is illegal even in at-will states.
393. So, that's a huge red flag because, you know, proper HR procedures are, hmm, essential for protecting both employees and the company! Without documentation or progressive discipline policies, the company is basically, well, asking for legal trouble.
394. That immediate escort practice is [clearing throat] sometimes standard for security reasons, but it needs to be applied consistently. If they only do it to certain employees, that could suggest discriminatory treatment.
395. Oh no, that's, um, [whispering] potentially a pregnancy discrimination case right there! Terminating someone shortly after maternity leave, I mean, without documented performance issues, that's exactly the kind of, err, pattern that employment lawyers look for.
396. Smart move documenting everything! Keep copies of all emails, take notes with dates and times, and if possible, back everything up somewhere outside the company's systems.
397. That depends entirely on your state's recording laws! Some states are one-party consent states where you can record if you're part of the conversation, but others require all parties to consent.
398. Well, that culture of fear is, sort of, unfortunately common but, you know, it's also evidence of a hostile work environment! The thing is, when employees can demonstrate that, um, legitimate benefits are being discouraged, that's another potential legal issue.
399. That's potentially fraudulent misrepresentation! If they're knowingly hiring people or assigning long-term work while planning layoffs, employees might have claims for detrimental reliance or even fraud.
400. Absolutely, yes, and actually, the sooner the better! Most employment attorneys offer, hmm, free consultations, and they can, you know, help you understand your rights and, basically, what evidence you should be gathering right now.
401. Oh, I mean, that's actually one of those beautiful linguistic contradictions we've inherited, you know? It originally meant to literally raise your head to be alert, but somewhere along the centuries it morphed into a warning that often makes us duck instead.
402. Right? Language evolution is wonderfully illogical sometimes. It's like how we park in driveways and drive on parkways, or how "cleave" can mean both to split apart and to stick together.
403. Absolutely! It's called a contronym or auto-antonym - a word that's its own opposite. English has dozens of them, like "dust" which can mean to add fine particles or remove them.
404. Well, context is, uhh, everything really - our brains are, I guess, remarkably good at disambiguating based on surrounding words and situations.
405. No no, I'm [frustrated] honestly not! These are, er, real linguistic phenomena that, you know, linguists have studied for decades - the technical term is actually "polysemy" when words develop multiple meanings.
406. Ah, now that's, um, [very sincerely] my favorite language controversy, basically - "literally" has been used figuratively since the 1700s, including by authors like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, so the "misuse" people complain about is actually centuries old.
407. She used it for emphasis and hyperbole, just like we do today! Language isn't static - it breathes and evolves with the people who speak it, which is why dictionaries describe usage rather than prescribe it.
408. Not at all! Meaning emerges from shared understanding and context. Even when words shift, communication continues because we're constantly negotiating meaning together in real-time.
409. Right? It's like, well, language is this living collaborative artwork we're all, sort of, constantly creating together without even realizing it.
410. Oh absolutely - here's the thing, "sanction" can mean both to approve something officially and, um, to impose a penalty, which basically makes international news headlines delightfully ambiguous sometimes.
411. Well, it's basically already here. Every phone tracks location, every purchase creates data, and corporations sell that information to whoever pays.
412. They've traded privacy for convenience. Most don't realize how that data gets weaponized against them for insurance rates, job applications, even dating apps.
413. Right, like, the average person is actually captured on camera, I mean, three hundred times per day in cities. That footage gets run through facial recognition and stored indefinitely.
414. The normalization is, er, the scariest part because, honestly, the thing is once infrastructure exists, it never goes away. Today's anti-terrorism tool becomes tomorrow's tool for crushing dissent.
415. Not just walking, we're paying for it. Smart speakers, doorbell cameras, fitness trackers, we're literally buying our own surveillance devices.
416. Ring shares footage with police departments, hmm, without warrants, kind of creating this unofficial surveillance network anyway. Amazon basically built a private police state and people paid them to do it.
417. Absolutely.
418. They already are, right so, credit scores determine housing, um, predictive policing targets neighborhoods, and algorithms decide who gets bail, actually. The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed.
419. Yeah, these risk assessment tools that supposedly predict reoffense rates but really just encode existing biases. Judges follow the computer's recommendation about seventy percent of the time.
420. The nightmare is that we've automated injustice and called it progress. These systems don't eliminate bias, they just give it a scientific veneer that makes it harder to challenge.
421. Well, it's... actually, it's not [very quietly] a symphony exactly, more like, hmm, a sonic meditation? Picture waves crashing but—reversed, time folding backwards into silence, each note dissolving before it's born.
422. Oh! Traditional notation is—well, it's [high-pitched] useless for this, basically, so I invented my own system? Colors become dynamics, shapes transform into timbre... the score looks more like abstract art than music!
423. Beauty isn't... it's not the goal? I'm chasing something more primal—that moment between sleeping and waking where reality gets... slippery, bendable, where sound becomes physical and touches you from inside.
424. Constantly! My brain is—okay so, imagine a radio, right, but tuned to, er, seventeen stations simultaneously? Melodies cascade and collide, rhythms multiply... sometimes I forget which sounds are real and which are just... mine.
425. Overwhelming is... underselling it? Yesterday I heard a garbage truck's brakes and suddenly understood Mahler's ninth symphony—not intellectually but cellularly, like my bones were vibrating at the exact frequency of human grief!
426. Playing implies... linearity? What I do is more like—sculpting air, bending physics... but sure, close your eyes and I'll show you how Tuesday sounds when it's angry.
427. Every day has its own harmonic signature! Tuesday vibrates at 247 hertz—frustrated, impatient, leaning forward... Monday is lower, resigned at 196, while Saturday? Saturday screams at 440, pure possibility!
428. Discovered implies choice? I was seven, practicing scales, when suddenly each note... split open, revealed infinite notes inside, fractals of sound spiraling endlessly inward—I've been chasing that rabbit hole ever since!
429. Not hear—experience! It's synesthetic chaos where C major tastes purple and minor sevenths smell like rain... my nervous system is basically a mixing board for reality's hidden frequencies!
430. Mind-blowing is, er, just the beginning—wait until you realize, honestly, that reality itself is, you know, music... just vibrations pretending to be solid, and we're all, um, just notes in some cosmic composition nobody's listening to!
431. Well, I figured if I'm paying forty dollars for, you know, something I could make at home for five, I might as well, err, get the full linguistic workout too—plus it sounds way fancier when you butcher French pronunciation!
432. Hey, at least I committed to it with confidence! Nothing says sophisticated like mispronouncing cuisine with absolute certainty while wearing my emergency date shirt that still has the fold lines from the package.
433. Sweet, definitely sweet! I mean, my other option was the shirt with, hmm, the taco stains from lunch, so really, you know, you're witnessing peak effort here—折り目 and all!
434. I was trying to say, well, [clearing throat] fold marks but my translation app, um, betrayed me—though honestly, mixing three languages badly in one dinner conversation should, basically, earn me sophistication points somewhere!
435. Oh perfect, [hesitantly] now we have dinner and a show! Quick, should I, err, blow it out or let it burn as a, you know, romantic gesture? Actually, is flaming breadstick a metaphor for this date?
436. No no, but, like, I am going to Instagram it because, honestly, how often does your food literally ignite itself? This is, um, content gold—"Hot date, hotter appetizers!"
437. Too late, already got seventeen likes! Besides, this is way better than those staged perfect couple photos—we're keeping it real with actual fire hazards and pronunciation casualties!
438. Look, if we're going down, um, we're going down viral! Plus years from now we'll, basically, have documentation of the exact moment we realized fancy restaurants are, you know, completely overrated!
439. Absolutely, somewhere that doesn't judge when you, hmm, pronounce mozzarella like a normal human! Plus those places don't, actually, charge extra for the theatrical breadstick flames—they just, well, call it "well done!"
440. That's my specialty—transforming catastrophes into [excited] comedy gold! Besides, any date where we both leave with our eyebrows intact and a viral video is technically a massive success by my standards!
441. What exactly do you want me to say? That I'm [curious] surprised you finally showed up after three years? Your timing's impeccable—she can't exactly be disappointed in you anymore.
442. Fair? You want to, um, talk about fair? She waited, you know, every holiday, every birthday—hell, she even kept your, basically, ridiculous tea collection thinking you'd come back for it.
443. Couldn't what? Pick up a phone? Send a letter? You disappeared like she meant nothing, and now you show up with grocery-store flowers expecting absolution from a headstone.
444. Of course you didn't know! You have to actually, er, be present in someone's life to, you know, know things—that's how, basically, relationships work.
445. Why? Because the truth makes you uncomfortable? You taught me that trick, remember—running away when things get too real, too complicated.
446. Intentions don't erase damage. But you always were [flirtatious] good at convincing yourself otherwise, weren't you? That charm of yours—it works on everyone except the people who actually knew you.
447. Because someone needs to say it! Everyone else will pat your shoulder and tell you grief is complicated, but I won't pretend your absence didn't accelerate everything.
448. Congratulations on your guilt. Too bad it's about three years and six feet too late to matter to anyone but you.
449. No. Mothers get visits, phone calls, presence. What you had was a biological connection you treated like an inconvenience until it was gone.
450. With who? She's dead. I'm done. And those pathetic carnations are already wilting—even they know when something's pointless.
451. That's what they brought me in for, yes. Though I should mention I trained with the Russian national team for six years, so the expectations might actually be justified.
452. Is that, you know, so hard to believe? I mean, just because I'm wearing, um, rainbow trunks doesn't mean I can't, basically, execute a perfect barracuda spin.
453. Oh they do, but I, well, negotiated an exception—it's, kind of, my trademark from Moscow, and honestly, it helps the judges remember me.
454. They remember me for breaking three world records while wearing it. The swimsuit just makes sure they're already watching when I hit the water—psychology matters in this sport.
455. Four, actually, if you count [furious] juniors. Look, I know you're the team captain and you're protective of your squad, but I'm here to help, not steal anyone's spotlight.
456. You didn't have to—your face when, actually, I mentioned Russia said it, er, [enunciating every word] loud and clear, you know? But here's the thing, I left all that behind for a reason.
457. Because your little, you know, community pool group has something they didn't—you actually, I mean, look like you're having fun out there, even when you're, basically, losing spectacularly.
458. Last week's meet? You guys finished your routine, hmm, forty-five seconds after the music ended because someone—I think it was, actually, you—forgot the, er, entire third sequence.
459. I've been watching for three months, trying to decide if this was the right move. Your technical skills need work, but your joy in the water? That's something you can't teach.
460. I gave up Moscow for, well, the chance to remember why I, basically, started swimming in the first place—not for medals but because being underwater feels, you know, like flying.
461. Actually, um, I've been trying to grant you wishes for, well, the past seven years but, er, something about you keeps, [puzzled], deflecting my magic completely.
462. That's exactly the problem because every time I try to, [frustrated], improve something in your life, you've already, [bewildered], found a way to make it better yourself through sheer, [admiring], optimism.
463. [warm] You know, er, in all my centuries of granting wishes, um, I've never met someone whose natural, [enchanted], joy creates its own kind of magic that actually, well, [fascinated], repels my spells. [chuckles]
464. [tender] Well, um, the thing is, I've grown quite fond of watching you, [affectionate], turn every setback into an opportunity, even when my, uh, magic couldn't help. [sighs softly]
465. Listen, um, most people need magic to see possibilities but you, well, you create them out of, [marveling], thin air with nothing but hope and determination, which is, er, [impressed], more powerful than any spell I know.
466. [surprised] Friends with a mortal who, um, doesn't need my magic, well, that would be, [contemplative], a first in my eternal existence, but I mean, [delighted], why not try something new after all these centuries?
467. [gentle] Well, that sounds absolutely lovely, though, um, I should warn you that I might still, er, accidentally make flowers bloom when I laugh.
468. [moved] You know, um, in all my years of granting wishes, I've never, well, [tearful], had someone offer me friendship without wanting anything magical in return, just, er, my company.
469. [whispered] Um, well, I... thank you.
470. [peaceful] Perhaps you've been granting my wish all along without even, [content], knowing it. [sighs happily]
471. [defensive] And I, uh, didn't expect my sister to be, [bitter], casing this hotel with those same nervous tics from when we, err, used to steal from corner stores as kids, [accusatory], pretending she's just another guest.
472. [stern] Oh please, I mean, at least what I do is, [proud], legal and I actually, umm, pay taxes instead of sneaking around luxury hotels planning god knows what.
473. [hurt] Selling myself is exactly what kept you in school after mom died while you, [angry], pretended not to know where the money came from, [resentful], turning your nose up at my designer clothes. [long pause]
474. [softer] Well, um, maybe if you'd actually talked to me instead of, uhh, disappearing for five years, [pained], we could have worked through it together like we, er, used to work through everything else.
475. [stunned] Dad was nothing like me because he, [firm], took what he wanted without consent.
476. [resigned] We are different.
477. [thoughtful] Because, umm, survival looks different when you're alone than when, well, you have someone watching your back. [voice cracks]
478. [vulnerable] You know, uh, I still have that apartment on the east side with, umm, the fire escape we used to dream about, [hopeful], where we could see the whole city and plan our, well, legitimate futures away from all this.
479. [gentle] I fixed the radiator but kept the coffee maker because some mornings, [wistful], I still make two cups out of habit even though, [sad], there's nobody there to drink the second one anymore.
480. [hopeful] Yeah, well, um, we're still those same kids who, [warm], promised to protect each other, just, uhh, wearing more expensive armor now. [laughs softly]
481. [defeated] They already have security footage showing me at the, [hollow], machine during the shift when everything went wrong. [laughs bitterly]
482. Just, [broken], drop it.
483. [resigned] Well, um, they're offering me, [desperate], fifty grand to keep my mouth shut and, you know, take the, [cracking], blame which is more than I'll ever see working these, [trembling], machines.
484. My kid needs surgery that insurance won't, [choked up], cover and I've got collectors calling about my wife's, [breaking], chemo bills so yeah, I'm taking their, [bitter], dirty money. [coughs]
485. [raw] Um, look, I've been done since the day they picked me, [exhausted], to be their patsy, you know? [sighs heavily]
486. [stunned] You're, um, lying because, well, Jenkins would never be that, [shaky], sloppy and anyway, even if you had proof they'd just, [hopeless], bury it along with both of, [quieter], us. [voice cracks]
487. [panicked] Jesus Christ, um, do you have any idea what you've, [terrified], done because these people don't just, well, fire whistleblowers, they, [whispered], destroy them completely.
488. [desperate] Look, uh, my family needs me alive more than they need me, [pleading], innocent so please, I mean, just delete whatever you have and, [begging], walk away while you still can.
489. [anguished] They own the cops, they own the, [defeated], judges, hell they probably own the, [bitter], FBI agents too so we're already, [dying inside], dead men walking.
490. Fine, but when they come for our families, [grim], remember this was your choice. [walks away]
491. [defensive] Well, I mean, that's impossible. [scoffs]
492. [measured] Look, uhh, those ingredients were sold to me as, [desperate], traditional botanical extracts and, I mean, I had no idea what they actually contained. [exhales sharply]
493. [pleading] I mean, er, my family's distillery has been using these recipes for, [cracking], generations without knowing, umm, what the original ingredients really were.
494. [desperate] Well, um, if this gets out, my entire business will be, [panicking], destroyed and, er, thirty employees will lose their jobs—surely we can, [frantic], find some way to handle this quietly.
495. [resigned] I'll, um, stop production immediately and, well, destroy every bottle if you just give me, [exhausted], time to reformulate everything and, [defeated], make this right somehow, I mean, there has to be a way forward here.
496. [stunned] You, er, you already called them without even, well, hearing my side or, [broken], giving me a chance to explain how this, um, happened or what I was willing to do to, [desperate], fix it. [voice cracks]
497. [defeated] So, um, that's it then. [long pause]
498. [bitter] Well, um, when you watch thirty families lose their income because of, er, something I didn't even know I was doing, I hope your, [cracking], moral high ground keeps you warm at night and, umm, helps you sleep.
499. [hollow] I suppose, um, when you put it that way, there's, [broken], nothing left to say except that I'm sorry for, well, what I've done. [whispers]
500. [bitter] Well, I mean, he was still my father even though, [cold], you made sure I never got to work beside him in the, [trailing off], factory like I always dreamed, you know?
501. [hollow] Right.
502. [measured] Playing with bows and arrows is how I, [proud], feed my family now without destroying my body. [sighs]
503. He never forgave himself for choosing, [pained], you over me when the business started failing either.
504. He begged me to stay and be, [bitter], your assistant after I'd been running the night shift for, [voice breaking], three years while you took credit for, [disgusted], everything.
505. [softer] Well, um, she's the one who taught me archery, [nostalgic], you know, said I needed something besides the, [thoughtful], smell of raw meat and blood to define my life, I mean. [pauses]
506. [stunned] Wait, um, you still have it after all these, [emotional], years because I thought, well, dad threw everything of hers away, you know?
507. You protected it for me even after, [disbelieving], everything we said to each other that, [remorseful], night? [long pause]
508. [tearful] The business is gone, [accepting], dad's gone, but we're still here and maybe that's, [growing], enough to build something new. [crying softly]
509. [gentle] Yeah, um, maybe it's, [peaceful], finally okay. [sighs]
510. [measured] Dad, I mean, this isn't personal—these regulations exist because, [firm], your generation fished these waters to near collapse and, um, [exhausted], someone has to stop it before there's nothing left.
511. [frustrated] The science is clear that the bluefin population has, [emphatic], dropped seventy percent since you started, [voice rising], and your nets are still pulling up juveniles that haven't even had a chance to, [trailing off], reproduce.
512. [sincere] I remember those winters, Dad, when you'd come home, umm, [pained], smelling like diesel and salt, too exhausted to even, well, eat dinner with us.
513. Mom's life insurance put me through law school after, um, [sharp], she died alone while you were chasing tuna three hundred miles offshore, well, [accusatory], remember that part?
514. [softer] I know you were trying, Dad, but, um, [conflicted], that doesn't change the fact that these waters are dying.
515. [gentle] Not this time, not without, [steady], intervention and regulations that give the ecosystem time to, [earnest], recover. [sighs]
516. [hurt] I watched our family, [quiet], fall apart over this boat and this life.
517. [trembling] And I needed a father who could, [struggling], breathe on land too. [pause]
518. [pleading] This isn't revenge, Dad, it's me trying to, [desperate], save something before you destroy it completely like you, [whispered], destroyed us. [crying]
519. [hopeful] We could work together to transition your operation to, [careful], sustainable practices, find a way that honors both the past and, [sincere], ensures there's a future.
520. [warm] Well, um, if it isn't the boy who used to, [emotional], steal day-old pastries from my mother's bakery, now wearing a, [examining], thousand-dollar suit and looking like he, [nostalgic], owns half the county—which I heard you actually do.
521. Some of us found reasons to, [gentle], stay instead of reasons to leave, and this place became, [thoughtful], home in ways I never expected it could. [soft laugh]
522. [understanding] Your mother told me everything before she, [sad], passed—about the scholarship, the opportunity, the pressure.
523. [reflective] Watching you leave was the hardest and, [proud], best thing I ever did because look at what you've, [earnest], become—everything we dreamed about when we were just two kids with, [wistful], nothing but hope. [sighs deeply]
524. [measured] The world needed conquering by someone like you who could actually, [firm], change things out there.
525. [shocked] Um, what... what are you saying?
526. [tearful] You can't just walk in here after twenty years and try to, [struggling], fix everything with money like it's some kind of, [bitter], transaction between us.
527. [softly] God, you're still that same kid. [crying]
528. [warm] Yeah, well, that kid changed my life too by showing me that, um, dreams were worth having even if they meant, [accepting], letting go of the people you love most, even if it meant, [peaceful], staying behind to guard what mattered here.
529. That depends on whether you're staying for real this time or just, [cautious], passing through with grand gestures again.
530. [shocked] Oh my God, you're the billboard installer who—I had no, [trembling], idea you lived in this building when I, [uncomfortable], asked for help moving my couch upstairs. [long pause]
531. Look, I was just, um, [defensive], following the company guidelines and the medical reports said you could, well, [struggling], perform sedentary work even though you, uh, [softer], told us you couldn't sit for more than twenty minutes.
532. [guilty] I remember your file actually—three surgeries, chronic pain, [quieter], couldn't climb ladders anymore which was literally your entire, [breaking], career for twenty years installing billboards across the state. [sighs heavily]
533. [whispered] I'm so sorry.
534. [desperate] I wanted to approve it but my supervisor said the documentation wasn't, um, [trembling], sufficient and if I went against policy one more time they'd, well, [broken], fire me and I have my own kids to feed, you know. [voice cracks]
535. [pleading] Um, please, I mean, let me help somehow.
536. [sympathetic] I've been carrying the weight of cases like yours for years, watching, [heavy], good people lose everything while I rubber-stamped denials, [disgusted], knowing the system was designed to wear you down until you gave up. [exhales]
537. Every denial letter I wrote made me, [ashamed], sick to my stomach but the quotas were non-negotiable and they tracked our approval rates.
538. [earnest] Listen, um, I left that job two weeks ago because I couldn't, well, [intense], keep destroying lives for a company that gave bonuses for keeping, you know, [disgusted], claim payouts below target percentages.
539. [vulnerable] I keep a folder of every claim I denied wrongfully, including yours, [shaking], hoping someday I could make it right even though I know that's, [defeated], impossible because the damage is already done. [starts crying]
540. [calm] The deadline for this character rig doesn't, [matter-of-fact], care about the riots or the fact that society seems to be collapsing around us.
541. [philosophical] Strange as it sounds, creating something beautiful feels like, [thoughtful], the only sane response to all the, [heavy], destruction happening right now.
542. You came to steal computers but, [curious], you're standing here talking to me instead of, [amused], running away with that laptop you're, [gesturing], holding.
543. [gentle] This particular character is learning to walk again after, [emotional], losing her legs in an accident.
544. [earnest] Every joint rotation and weight shift has to be, [precise], perfect or the whole illusion breaks and she becomes just, [frustrated], pixels instead of someone struggling to, [passionate], overcome.
545. [softening] The render farm still has power because we're on the hospital grid, and I could, [hesitant], burn some of her favorite films to disc if you, [careful], put that laptop back where you, [meaningful], found it. [pause]
546. Well, um, the thing is, I've been alone here for, [lonely], seventy-two hours straight, and honestly, er, [confessing], having someone to share my work with feels more, [vulnerable], valuable than any equipment.
547. [determined] There's an old animation tablet in the storage room that nobody will, [conspiratorial], miss if it happens to leave with those, [warm], movies.
548. [wise] Maybe being a little crazy is how we, [resolute], stay human when everything else falls apart.
549. [welcoming] Pull up a chair, um, and I'll show you how we're teaching her to, [proud], dance again, I mean, one frame at a time.
550. [frustrated] God, I cannot believe this is happening again. Like, seriously, how many times do I have to, um, explain the same thing? [sigh] It's just—honestly, I feel like I'm talking to a wall sometimes. And the thing is, [quietly], I know I shouldn't let it get to me this much, but here we are. 

[pause] Okay, so maybe I'm being too harsh. I mean, they're probably trying their best, right? [hesitantly] Or at least, er, that's what I keep telling myself. Sometimes I think maybe it's actually my fault—like maybe I'm not communicating clearly enough? [confused] But then I remember last week when everything went perfectly fine, and I'm like, wait, so what changed?

[warm] You know what though? When it does work out, it's honestly kind of amazing. [excited] Like yesterday, oh my God, we had this breakthrough moment where everything just clicked! For about five minutes, anyway. [laugh] Then we went right back to square one. 

[bitter] I guess that's just how it goes, huh? Two steps forward, [slowly], three steps back. And here's the thing—I'm tired. [exhausted] Really, really tired of this whole cycle. But what else am I supposed to do? [trailing off] Just keep pushing through, I guess...
551. [shaky voice] It passed. Oh my God, it actually—I mean, [gasp softly] thirty-seven votes. We needed thirty-five and we got, um, thirty-seven. [laugh] I keep checking my phone like maybe I misread it but, [very quietly], it's real. 

Years of, you know, sleeping in my office, and the divorces—well, [regretful] that's not what matters right now. What matters is that, er, eight million people are going to have [passionately] actual healthcare they can afford! [sniffle] Sorry, I just—the thing is, I keep thinking about Marcus. [pause] That kid who wrote me about his insulin, how his mom was literally rationing it and—[cry] God.

[clearing throat] Anyway, so many people said this would never happen, right? They said I was, like, [bitter] "too idealistic" or whatever. But here's the thing, [confidently] we did it. We actually fucking did it. [belly laugh] Can I say that on—I don't even care!

[warm] My team, they're all—honestly, they're probably drunk by now. [chuckle] And my daughter, she, uh, she texted me "proud of you mom" with like seventeen heart emojis and [crying while speaking] that's when I really lost it. Because, I mean, [relieved] all those missed recitals finally meant something, you know? [long pause] We changed everything today.
552. Six months. [pause] Six fucking months she's been using again and [angry] nobody told me? I just found the texts on Jake's phone—I wasn't snooping, I swear, his phone was just [shaky voice] sitting there open and I saw her dealer's name. [frustrated] How could he keep this from me? We're supposed to be a team, we're supposed to— [trailing off]

[upset] God, all those family dinners where she seemed off and I just, I thought maybe she was tired or stressed from work. [bitter] But no, she was high. [long pause] In front of the kids. [whispering] My kids. 

[anxious] And Jake knew, this whole time he knew and he just let me sit there like an idiot believing her lies about being clean. [sarcastic] "Oh, I'm doing so great, almost two years sober!" [furious] What a fucking joke.

[sad] I mean, addiction is a disease, I get that, but the lying? [confused] The elaborate stories about her sponsor and the meetings she clearly wasn't attending? [very quietly] How do we even move forward from this?

[exhausted] I don't know if I'm more angry at her or at Jake for making me the only one who didn't know. [sigh] Like, what else are they keeping from me?
553. Three saves yesterday. Three people who went home to their families, and I just... [bitter] I keep thinking about how I handed out Narcan like candy that same week Danny was dying alone in his apartment. [pause] Everyone calls me a hero, you know? [sarcastic] Yeah, the overdose prevention specialist who couldn't even recognize the signs in her own brother. I mean, I literally teach people what to look for—the isolation, the excuses, the weight loss. [shaky voice] He had all of them. Every single one. And I just, um, I convinced myself he was stressed about work. [long pause] 

The worst part is [crying while speaking] I still do this job. I show up every day and save strangers because maybe—maybe if I save enough of them, it'll somehow... [trailing off] God, that doesn't even make sense. [sniffle] But when I reversed that kid's overdose last month and his sister hugged me? [very quietly] I pretended she was Danny. Just for a second. [hesitantly] Is that fucked up? 

Actually, you know what keeps me going? [passionately] Every person I bring back is someone's Danny. Someone's brother who gets another chance that mine didn't. [very melancholic] So yeah, I'll keep doing this until I can't anymore.
554. [gasp softly] Oh my God, I just—they actually called. Like, Hollywood. Real Hollywood. Um, I keep looking at my phone thinking maybe I imagined it but no, there it is in my call history. [very excited] Warner Brothers! They said—wait, let me get this right—they said my work on that indie film caught their attention, specifically the, uh, the period-accurate newspaper I aged and the way I matched those vintage fountain pens to the exact year.

[short pause]

I mean, honestly, I thought I was being obsessive when I spent three days researching ink formulations from 1947. My roommate said I was—what did she call it—"pathologically detailed." [laugh] But apparently that's exactly what they want for this new production. 

[anxious] Here's the thing though, like, what if I can't deliver at that level? This is, you know, millions of dollars, A-list actors, the whole thing. [shaky voice] They want me to fly out next week for a meeting. Next week! I don't even—I've never been in a room with producers like that.

[pause]

But then again, [confidently] I've been preparing for this my entire life, right? Every single prop I've touched, every detail I've obsessed over... [warmly] maybe this is actually happening because I never cut corners. God, I need to call my mom. [very happily] She's going to absolutely lose it!
555. [warm] You know, people always give me this look when I tell them what I do for a living. Like, um, they step back a little, right? [chuckle] But honestly, I've learned more about—about really living from digging graves than I ever did sitting in that office cubicle. [pause] See, the thing is, when you're there at six in the morning, fog still clinging to the headstones, and you're preparing someone's final resting place, you start to notice things. [slowly] The families who come, they don't talk about, er, spreadsheets or promotions. [emotional] They talk about Sunday dinners, about that time dad sang karaoke terribly, [laugh] about mom's burnt cookies that everyone pretended to love. It's the small moments, you know? The ordinary stuff that turns out to be, [sincerely] well, everything really. [sigh] I mean, I've buried CEOs and homeless folks, and at the end, what matters is—did you laugh hard? [animated] Did you love freely? Did you, um, dance at weddings even with two left feet? [softly] So yeah, I dig graves. But what I'm really doing is, [pause] I guess I'm learning how to live. [very quietly] Every single day, I'm learning how to actually be alive.
556. [animated] God, I love you guys so much! Like, seriously, when have we ever had a bad time together? I mean, remember that night we, uh, completely destroyed Jake's kitchen trying to make that flambé thing? [laugh loudly] His face when the smoke alarm went off! And honestly, nights like this—dancing till, you know, everything hurts, singing those terrible songs—this is what life's about, right? 

[pause] 

I should, er, probably tell you all something but... [cheerful] actually no, forget it! Who needs deep conversations when we have, hmm, this amazing playlist? Come on, Sarah, dance with me! [very excited] This is our song! Remember when we basically screamed this at karaoke and that poor bartender just... [trailing off] 

[bittersweet] You know what though? I just want you all to know that, well, these nights mean everything to me. Like really, truly. [quickly] But anyway, enough of that sappy stuff—who wants shots? [shouting] Shots for my favorite people in the entire world! 

[quietly] I'm gonna miss—I mean, uh, I'm gonna make sure we do this every weekend, okay? Promise me. Actually, you know what? [passionately] Let's just live in this moment right now. Because honestly, this—all of you—it's perfect. [sigh] It's so perfectly perfect.
557. [bitter] So apparently I'm supposed to just... smile and welcome them into the family now. Like nothing happened. [pause] Three years ago, this same person had my daughter crying herself to sleep for, what, six months? [frustrated] And now they're back together and—oh, here's the kicker—engaged. [laugh] I mean, honestly, what am I supposed to do with that?

[sigh] Your kid calls you up, all excited, "Dad, we're getting married!" and it's... them. The one who, um, absolutely destroyed her that summer. [angry] I wanted to say something—God, I wanted to say so much—but she sounded so... [trailing off] [warm] She sounded happy. Really happy.

[hesitantly] So I guess I'm practicing now. For Sunday dinner. "Welcome to the family." [sarcastic] That's good, right? Natural? [pause] Maybe I should try it with more... enthusiasm. [forced cheerful] "Welcome to the family!" [groan] 

[quietly] Look, I know people change. I do. And if they make her happy now, if they've grown up or whatever, then... [reluctant] then I need to let it go. [stern] But I swear, if they hurt her again—[short pause] well. [confidently] They'll find out exactly what kind of father-in-law I can be.
558. [gasp] They chose me. They actually—I can't... [very quietly] thirty years of cutting stone and they chose my design for the memorial. I keep reading the letter, like, maybe I misunderstood? But no, it's right there. My hands are literally shaking. [short pause] You know how many nights I stayed up sketching, um, reworking every single detail? The curve of each letter, the way the marble will catch morning light—everything had to be perfect. [passionately] These aren't just names we're carving, these are heroes. Real people who gave everything. [pause] My grandfather, he was a stonemason too, taught me that stone remembers. [very sincerely] Every chisel mark, every deliberate cut—it all stays forever. And now I'm going to be the one who... [trailing off] God, the responsibility of it. Generations of families will touch these names, [emotional] trace the letters with their fingers, looking for their loved ones. Kids who aren't even born yet will come here on field trips, learning about sacrifice and courage. [deep pitch] I've carved headstones before, sure, but this is—this is different. [clearing throat] This is history. I get to give these heroes something permanent, [confidently] something that will outlast all of us. My tools, my hands, honoring them the only way I know how.
559. [hesitantly] Look, I know what you're thinking—ex-fugitive working with kids, right? But honestly, that's exactly why I can reach them. [passionate] These kids, they don't trust anyone in a suit who's never, like, actually been cold enough to sleep in a fucking doorway. [short pause] When I tell them I spent three months running, sleeping under bridges, dodging cops—[bitter] eating out of dumpsters, basically—their whole body language changes. [warming] They lean in, you know? 

[animated] It's like, um, last week this kid, he wouldn't talk to anyone at the shelter. But I recognized that look, that constant checking over your shoulder thing, so I just—[trailing off] I mean, I told him about the time I had to steal shoes because mine literally fell apart. [laugh] And suddenly he's telling me everything. Where he sleeps, who's after him, why he can't go home. 

[empathetically] The thing is, these kids can smell bullshit from a mile away. They know when you're faking it. [confident] But when I say "I get it," I actually fucking get it. [pause] I know which McDonald's lets you use the bathroom without buying anything. I know how to make twenty dollars last a week. [very sincerely] And honestly? [emotional] That knowledge shouldn't go to waste when it could literally save someone's life.
560. [shaky voice] God, I can't—I mean, we actually got them out. All of them. The whole family. [pause] My hands are still, like, trembling from working the controls. You know, twenty years I've been operating excavators, but this was—[exhale deeply] this was different. Really different. When I saw that little girl's face through the gap we made, I just... [sigh] The dad was holding the ceiling beam up with his bare hands—I don't even know how he had the strength, honestly. And, um, the precision needed to not cause another collapse while pulling debris... [anxious] one wrong move with that bucket and the whole thing could've—anyway, we got them. [relieved] That's what matters, right? The mom, she was protecting the baby the entire time, just curled around him. [voice breaking] Six hours they were under there. Six. [pause] I keep thinking about, like, what if I'd moved too fast or, you know, miscalculated the load? But my crew, they were—[grateful] everyone was incredible. The way we all just worked together. [emotional] That family is going home tonight because of what we did. [sniffle] I think I need to, uh, just sit here for a minute. Let it sink in. We saved them. We actually saved them.
561. [anxious] Look, I never thought I'd be using what I learned to, um, help people like this. [pause] When I studied all that stuff years ago it was just—I mean, it was academic, you know? Like, theoretical. [nervous laugh] But then Saturday happened and I'm watching these kids, er, these peaceful protesters just getting... [trailing off] 

[angry] They weren't doing anything wrong! [shaky voice] Just holding signs and, and singing, basically. And then the tear gas started and I just—my body just moved, I guess. [quickly] Started shouting about wind direction, telling people to, uh, pour milk on their faces, how to link arms properly. [pause] Things I never thought I'd actually... [sigh]

[very quietly] The thing is, hmm, once you know how these tactics work, you can't unknow them. [speeding up] You see the formations coming and you're like—okay, they're about to kettle everyone, we need exits here and here. [passionate] And these kids, they listened! They actually, um, they trusted me even though I'm just some random person yelling instructions.

[regretful] I keep thinking about my younger self studying all this stuff, sort of, fascinated by the strategy of it all. [bitter laugh] Never imagining I'd be on this side of it. [warm] But honestly? When I saw that grandmother get to safety because we created that, er, that human corridor? [very sincerely] That's when I knew this knowledge finally meant something.
562. [confused] Eight months. Um, I just—hold on, I'm reading this email again because, like, this can't be right. [short pause] They're pulling out? [angry] Because of what? Because Derek—oh my God, he actually, [gasp] he lied about our revenue? 

[furious] Are you kidding me right now? I mean, we were so close—literally, the contracts were being drawn up and he just, what, [bitter] thought he could fake our numbers? Twenty million, [shouting] gone! Just gone because he couldn't, I don't know, tell the truth? 

[upset] The thing is, I trusted him. You know? Like, [shaky voice] I defended him when Sarah said something felt off about those projections. And now, um, [sarcastic] surprise! She was right. [groan] 

I honestly can't—[pause] wait, does this mean we're done? Like actually done? Because, er, without this funding, [anxious] we can't make payroll next month. Thirty-two employees who, [quietly] who trusted us. Who trusted me. 

[crying while speaking] I should've checked the numbers myself. But no, I was too busy, like, schmoozing investors and doing presentations while Derek was just, [furious] what, cooking the books? [sigh] Eight months of my life. And for what? [bitter] For absolutely nothing.
563. Twenty-three years. That's how long I've been drilling bowling balls, and now Brunswick just—they're gone. [bitter] Like, the whole chain, shuttered overnight. I mean, what am I supposed to do with this certification now? Frame it? [pause] Nobody's gonna hire a ball driller when there's no alleys left in town. 

[frustrated] It's just, you know, I spent eighteen months getting certified. Learned about, uh, pitch angles and span measurements and lateral—whatever, it doesn't matter now. [sigh] My dad said I should've gone into plumbing. "Toilets never go out of style," he said. But no, I had to follow my passion, right?

[sad] The thing is, I was actually good at it. Really good. People would drive like forty miles just to have me drill their equipment. And honestly, there was something, I don't know, satisfying about getting someone's grip perfect. [quietly] Watching their average go up twenty pins because the ball finally fit right.

[angry] But sure, let's just bulldoze everything for another strip mall. Because that's what this town needs—more nail salons and, er, phone repair shops. [trailing off] I guess I could... I don't even know what I could do. [very melancholic] Twenty-three years of expertise, and it's basically worthless now.
564. Eight years. I mean, that's—that's almost a decade of my life, right? [bitter] And they just voted us out like we're some kind of, I don't know, like we're a problem instead of a solution. [pause] The thing is, um, these people have no idea what happens when you close a clinic like this. Actually, they probably do know, they just—[angry] they just don't care as long as it's not in their backyard anymore. 

I keep thinking about, er, all my patients. Like Marcus, who's been clean for three years now, and Sarah who just got her kids back, and—[voice breaking] what are they supposed to do? Drive forty miles to the next clinic? [frustrated] Half of them don't even have cars! 

You know what really gets me? [very slowly] We had a ninety-two percent retention rate. Ninety-two! That's basically unheard of in addiction treatment. But sure, let's just, hmm, throw all that away because some people are uncomfortable seeing, [mocking] "those people" in their precious neighborhood. 

[exhausted] I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do now. Eight years of fighting for these folks and it's just... [sigh] gone. Because of a vote. [long pause] God, I'm so tired.
565. [gasp] They called me back. The funeral home—they actually called me back! [shaky voice] I thought that door was just... completely closed, you know? After I bombed that interview so badly. [pause] Mrs. Henderson from the hospice, she um, she apparently told them about my volunteer work. [very quietly] About how I sit with families during their last goodbyes. 

[clearing throat] The director said—God, I can't believe he said this—[excited] he said watching someone hold space for grief without trying to fix it is exactly what they need. [laugh] I mean, I wasn't even trying to impress anyone! I was just... [trailing off] 

[sniffle] When I lost Dad, nobody knew what to say to me. So I guess, [warm] I learned how to just be there, without the awkward platitudes. [pause] They want me to start Monday. Monday! [very excited] After six months of thinking I'd ruined everything with that disaster of an interview where I—[chuckle] where I literally knocked over their urn display.

[crying while speaking] I keep thinking about telling Dad. He always said helping people through their worst days was sacred work. [deep pitch] "Death deserves dignity too, kiddo." [relieved] Maybe I haven't completely screwed up my life after all.
566. [bitter] Three years. Three years I've been, um, flagging these exact issues to the board. And now, [laugh] oh this is rich, they're eliminating my position because of "restructuring needs." Right, so basically they don't want someone who actually, you know, tells them the truth. [frustrated] I literally sat in that boardroom—what was it, February?—and I said, I mean, I practically begged them to look at the derivative exposure. The thing is, [pause] I had the models, the projections, everything. But no, they wanted aggressive growth, they wanted to, uh, "maximize shareholder value." [sarcastic] Well congratulations, you maximized yourself into a forty million dollar hole. 

[angry] And here's what really gets me—they're keeping Brad. Brad! The guy who, honestly, couldn't forecast his way out of a paper bag if you gave him, like, [shaky voice] sorry, I just—it's so frustrating because I know, [sighs] I know in six months they'll be scrambling. They'll hire some consultant for triple what they paid me to tell them exactly what I've been saying. [regretful] Maybe I should've just, er, kept my mouth shut and collected my bonus like everyone else. But that's not—[pause] I don't know, I guess that's not who I am.
567. [hesitantly] I was, um, looking at old photos earlier and... God, I just—I didn't recognize myself. Not physically, I mean, emotionally. [short pause] That person was so scared of literally everything, you know? And here's the thing, [voice breaking] I actually made it through all of that. [sniffle] Like, er, all those nights I thought I'd never be good enough, that I was basically just... pretending to be someone worth knowing. 

[crying while speaking] But I'm not pretending anymore. I mean, when did that even happen? When did I stop, uh, apologizing for existing? [laugh] It's so weird, right? I actually like who I am now. [warmly] Not perfect, obviously, but like—genuinely okay with myself. 

The thing is, [smiling speaking] I kept waiting for someone else to tell me I was enough, and then somewhere along the way I just... started believing it myself. [deep breath] All those years of thinking everyone else had it figured out while I was just, hmm, fumbling around in the dark. [confidently] But maybe that's how everyone does it, you know? We all just fumble until we don't. 

[very sincerely] And honestly? I'm really fucking proud of the person sitting here right now. [pause] Finally.
568. [anxious] So, um, they just called me into the office and—I mean, you know how I've been counting down the days? [confused] Like, literally, I have seventeen days left on my calendar before I was gonna, well, before art school starts and I was just going to—[pause] And then Mr. Henderson sits me down and he's all, [mocking] "We want to make you permanent, full benefits, the whole thing." [frustrated] Right NOW? Like, honestly, this is happening right now? 

[bitter] Three years, okay? Three years I've been stocking shelves and, uh, basically begging for more hours, and they pick THIS moment to—[sigh] I don't know. [sad] My portfolio is ready, I already paid the deposit, I told my mom I was finally doing it, you know? [shaky voice] And the thing is, art school isn't exactly—it's not cheap, and here they are offering me actual health insurance and, [hesitantly] err, a retirement plan? At twenty-three? 

[whispering] What if I'm making a huge mistake? [speeding up] Like what if this is the universe telling me to be practical and I'm just too stubborn to—no, wait, that's not—[passionately] I've wanted this since I was twelve! [very quietly] But rent is rent, and, hmm, paint costs money, and... [trailing off] I don't know anymore.
569. [gasp softly] No. No no no, this can't be—wait, let me run it again. [anxious] Okay so, um, the markers are matching at every single locus. Every one. I mean, after fifteen years of dead ends and, like, contaminated samples and—[pause] Jesus Christ, it's actually him. [whispering] The Riverside murders. We got him.

[shaky voice] I need to, uh, I need to call Detective Morrison but she's—no wait, she retired. God, how many people worked this case? [bitter] Thompson died still wondering who did it, you know? And here I am at, what, 2 AM on a Tuesday, just running samples because I couldn't sleep and—[gasp loudly] 

Oh my God, the families. [crying while speaking] They've been waiting fifteen years for answers. Fifteen years of not knowing who—[pause] I should probably, like, verify this one more time before I—but no, I've run it three times already. The statistical probability is, er, one in seven trillion. [laugh] Seven trillion!

[very quietly] All those late nights, all those theories we had that went nowhere... [relieved] And it was just sitting there in CODIS the whole time. He got arrested last month for, what was it, aggravated assault? [sigh] Fifteen years. [extremely happy] We actually did it. We solved it.
570. [timid] The production company didn't mention which clinic we'd be filming at today, and I had no, [anxious], idea this was your practice. [pause]
571. [hesitantly] Look, um, I know how this must seem, but I'm just here to, [quietly], do my job calibrating the cameras for the medical documentary, and, well, [shaky voice], I can ask to be reassigned if you want me gone.
572. [apologetic] I left because, um, watching you succeed in medical school while I was, [regretful], failing at everything made me feel like I'd never be, well, [very quietly], good enough to be your family anymore. [sigh]
573. [relieved] The truth is I've watched every medical show you've appeared on, followed your, [proud], research papers from behind a screen all these years.
574. [ashamed] Every time I picked up the phone to call, the, [nervous], words just wouldn't come out right. [long pause]
575. [eager] The filming schedule has us here for three weeks, which means we could, [optimistic], actually talk, maybe grab coffee between takes if you're, [softly], willing to try.
576. [sincerely] I've learned a lot about capturing truth through lenses, but, um, [contemplative], maybe it's time I learned how to be, [vulnerable], truthful without hiding behind a camera, you know.
577. I've been using it professionally for years because I didn't want to, [sad], ride on your reputation, but also couldn't, [whispering], bear to completely erase our connection, [tearful], even when I was too scared to use it.
578. [moved] And here I am, documenting other people's medical journeys when the most important, [emotional], story might be finding my way back to you.
579. So maybe we start with coffee tomorrow morning before filming, and, [hopefully], see where that takes us.
580. [proud] Well, you taught me, um, too well about how these, [accomplished], systems work, how to exploit every weakness in the, [bitter], old vacuum tube arrays that you refuse to, [measured], upgrade. [chuckles darkly]
581. [defensive] Truth? Um, you mean propaganda, well, dressed up in your, [sarcastic], quaint notions of journalistic integrity?
582. [cold] That passion died when I realized these, [contemptuous], connections you worship are just chains keeping people, [fierce], bound to outdated systems that need to, [determined], burn.
583. Sometimes the only way to be, [resolved], heard is to create silence first, to make people, [calculating], notice what's missing. [laughs bitterly]
584. The guilt you carry for things beyond your, [dismissive], control has always been your weakness, old man, that stubborn, [mocking], belief that dedication alone can hold back, [triumphant], progress. [scoffs]
585. Security will arrive in about, [matter-of-fact], twelve minutes when the backup generator kicks in. [pause]
586. [softening] That boy learned that, um, those songs were drowning out the screams of people who, [conflicted], needed real change, not your, well, comfortable traditions. [exhales slowly]
587. [accomplished] By the time, um, anyone realizes what I've really done here, well, the entire broadcast network will be, [satisfied], compromised beyond repair—my real, [victorious], masterpiece isn't what I destroyed tonight. [smiles coldly]
588. Those machines were already, [dismissive], dead, just like the world they were built to, [harsh], serve—I simply had the courage to pull the, [final], plug. [footsteps retreating]
589. [distant] Sometimes tearing down is the, [accomplished], only way to clear space for what needs to be, [prophetic], built—you taught me that when you stripped those old, [nostalgic], transmitters down to nothing and rebuilt them from scratch.
590. [warm] I understand this is, um, difficult for you, and I want to help, but well, [reassuring], there are some discrepancies in your employment history that we need to, you know, discuss.
591. Um, I see, well... [pause]
592. [empathetically] That sounds like a challenging situation, and I've seen cases where, [sensible], documentation doesn't tell the whole story, but I still need, [formal], verifiable information to process your appeal. [clearing throat]
593. The issue is that, um, your former employer states you were, [carefully], terminated for cause on March fifteenth, but you claim you, well, [confused], resigned voluntarily on March third, and we have, like, [stern], conflicting documentation for both dates. [cough]
594. [gently] I want to believe you, and I'm trying to, [sympathetic], understand your situation here, but without concrete evidence like that resignation confirmation email or, [slowly], a timestamped submission receipt, my hands are tied. [soft sigh]
595. Have you considered reaching out to, [thoughtful], the labor relations board about potential wrongful termination because that might, [hopeful], strengthen your case here while also addressing the, [concerned], larger issue with your former employer?
596. [compassionate] There are free legal aid services that, um, specialize in employment disputes, and I can, well, [helpful], give you their contact information—meanwhile, let me, you know, [determined], review your file one more time.
597. What I can do is flag your case for, [professional], secondary review with my supervisor who has more discretion in these situations.
598. [kindly] That's what I'm here for—to make sure everyone gets, [sincere], a fair evaluation of their circumstances.
599. Well, I mean, regardless of the outcome here, um, please know that, [genuinely], I've documented everything you've told me and, like, [encouraging], your appeal will get the thorough consideration it deserves, you know? [smile in voice]
600. [measured] I didn't expect you to show up in person when we could have, [formal], handled this through lawyers.
601. [cautious] The financial records show transfers that, [hesitantly], match the exact timing of those PAC expenditures, and we both know what that, [stern], looks like.
602. The timestamps tell a, [coldly], different story, especially when cross-referenced with the, [methodical], communication logs we subpoenaed from your, [quietly], former clients. [sigh]
603. [empathetically] Well, I mean, I want to believe that, but the evidence is, [worried], mounting and my job requires me to follow it wherever it, um, leads.
604. [hurt] That's not fair and, um, you know it—I recused myself twice but they, [firmly], kept assigning me back because I'm the only one who, well, understands how these campaigns actually operate. [long pause]
605. [regretful] The investigation has moved beyond my, [weary], control at this point. [cough]
606. [anticipating] Names and proof would certainly, [calculating], change the trajectory of this investigation, but you'd need documentation that's, [skeptical], more substantial than just your word against theirs.
607. [surprised] You're saying you have evidence that could, [hopeful], exonerate you and implicate others who've been, [eager], untouchable? [gasp softly]
608. [professionally warm] Well, um, if what you're saying is true, then we need to, [urgently], get those files into evidence immediately before anyone realizes you have them, I mean, for your own safety. [clearing throat]
609. I've always been after the, [determined], truth, not you—that's something you should have, um, remembered from our time working together, you know. [very sincerely]
610. [apologetic] Okay look, before you, [nervous], call the cops or whatever, I can, [hesitantly], explain everything and maybe we can, [quickly], work something out here.
611. Audio rendering actually.
612. [embarrassed] Um, your setup is, [warm], honestly the most beautiful configuration I've ever seen, like, you know? [sigh]
613. [flirtatious] The way you've optimized those containers with, [passionate], perfect load balancing and that custom orchestration script is, [very quietly], basically poetry in motion if we're being honest.
614. [confidently] Listen, um, what if instead of, [animated], reporting this whole thing, we could, like, [enthusiastically], collaborate on something that would blow both our industries away, you know? [laugh]
615. [sincere] I could teach you about, [passionately], frequency modulation and synthesis while you show me, [eagerly], proper authentication protocols instead of my embarrassing password cracking.
616. [defensive] Those audio plugins are, [frustrated], notoriously memory-hungry and your documentation was, [bitter], basically non-existent so I had to, [trailing off], guess at the optimal configurations...
617. [relieved] Um, really? [gasp]
618. [shy] Well, um, coffee sounds, er...
619. You know, I should probably be, [happy], more offended by that but honestly, um, [very sincerely], watching you work would be worth the humiliation, I mean. [deep pitch]
620. [exhausted] I'm sorry, I'm moving as fast as I can with this cart but my, [shaky voice], legs just aren't cooperating after my shift.
621. [confused] I, um, see a lot of patients and families, so I, well, [apologetic], don't always remember everyone, you know? [pause]
622. [slowly] Oh my God, yes, I remember Margaret—she kept, um, telling me about her son who, well, [smiling speaking], worked nights somewhere and couldn't be there, you know?
623. She made me promise to, [empathetically], tell you that she was brave and that you shouldn't blame yourself for being at work. [long pause]
624. [surprised] You've been looking for me all this time just to, [gently], say thank you when really I was just, [honestly], doing what anyone in my position would have done? [cough]
625. [thoughtfully] Sometimes the job isn't just about medicine, it's about, um, [sincerely], being human when someone needs it most, and well, your mother reminded me why I, [emotionally], became a nurse in the first place, you know? [sniffle]
626. [humble] That's wonderful to hear because honestly some days, [weary], I wonder if what I do makes any real difference.
627. [touched] After sixteen hours of losing two patients today, I really, [shakily], needed to hear this more than you could possibly, [tearfully], know right now. [cry]
628. That's incredibly sweet and I'm too tired to, [gratefully], argue with such kindness right now.
629. [laughing] I'm just a tired nurse who, um, [humbly], tries to do right by people, but well, thank you for seeing me as more than that today. [deep breath]
630. [formal] Those particular files are restricted and require special permissions that, [stern], typically take months to obtain through proper channels.
631. Well, I shouldn't be telling you this, but, [whispering], there are boxes in the basement archives that were never properly catalogued.
632. [empathetically] I've been the keeper of these records for thirty years and, well, sometimes the truth sits in boxes while, [regretful], lies get published in textbooks, you know?
633. [prudent] Well, there are lab notebooks with dates that, um, predate Hartley's publications by eighteen months, along with, [carefully], correspondence that suggests she tried to fight him but, [trailing off], the department buried it all...
634. [sympathetically] The old guard still has influence here, which is why, [nervous], I've kept these documents hidden rather than catalogued properly.
635. [conflicted] My position here requires discretion, but sometimes, [thoughtfully], doing what's right matters more than following protocol, and your mother's story has, [emotionally], haunted these archives long enough.
636. [resolved] Well, I became an archivist to preserve truth, not to, um, hide it, and if they fire me for, [proudly], finally doing the right thing, so be it.
637. [conspiratorial] There's a digitization project next week that would give us, [quickly], legitimate access to move boxes around without raising, [whispering loudly], suspicions.
638. [gently] Well, sometimes it takes a generation for, um, courage to catch up with injustice, and, [firmly], we're that generation now.
639. Well, your mother's work will finally see daylight, and, [sincerely], that's all any archivist really hopes for.
640. [confidently] There must be some administrative error because I distinctly remember, [smooth], walking across that stage in Cambridge twenty years ago.
641. [warm] Well, um, you know how these European offices are with their, [condescending], record-keeping, and I mean, sometimes the most successful deals are the ones that, [mocking], stay off the books for tax purposes, if you, er, understand what I'm saying. [chuckle]
642. [playful] Um, the credentials might be, well, enhanced, but the results speak for themselves because, [persuasive], every milestone has been hit perfectly and the synergies I've identified will, [animated], save the company millions, so, you know, does the piece of paper really matter? [laugh]
643. [dismissive] Look, um, I've successfully integrated, er, twelve companies using my methods, and whether I learned them at Harvard or, [proud], on the street shouldn't matter to anyone who, [quietly], actually cares about results, you know?
644. [whispering] We both know.
645. [hesitantly] Well, um, that you needed someone who could, [threatening], make certain problematic numbers disappear, you know?
646. Those offshore accounts didn't structure themselves and the, [sarcastic], creative accounting that made this deal possible required someone with, [formal], shall we say unconventional expertise. [trailing off]
647. [casual] Um, the email trail suggests otherwise, especially the ones where you, er, specifically asked me to handle things quietly, you know?
648. [smiling speaking] The board might interpret them differently when they see how perfectly everything, [calculating], aligned with your personal stock options vesting schedule. [sneeze]
649. [overly polite] Well, um, prison is such an ugly word, and besides, I think we both know that, [manipulative], mutual destruction benefits neither of us, so perhaps we should, er, discuss how to move forward with the merger as, [cheerful], originally planned, you know? [long pause]
650. [frustrated] Well, um, what exactly are you, [stern], telling me because, er, I have opening arguments at nine a.m. and you know, this case has been bulletproof for months.
651. [angry] So you're saying, um, someone has been, [shaky voice], falsifying chain of custody records on the key evidence that, er, well, my entire prosecution depends on?
652. [shocked] This destroys everything we've built, [loudly], everything that family has been waiting eighteen months to see justice for. [sigh]
653. [desperate] Tell me there's something, [crying while speaking], anything we can salvage here because if this evidence is compromised then a murderer, [whispering loudly], walks free tomorrow and I'm the one who, [very sad], failed those victims.
654. Um, wait, you mean there's, [excited], uncompromised evidence that hasn't been, I mean, well, tampered with sitting in a lab somewhere right now? [gasp]
655. [breathless] Um, God, if those samples are clean then, [passionately], we can still nail this bastard but, well, we need to, [frantically], get them secured before whoever did this, er, realizes they exist and I mean, makes them disappear too. [cough]
656. [overly polite] You beautiful, brilliant human being—you've just, [very excited], saved this case and probably my entire career from complete destruction.
657. Yeah, and when they realize we've, [worried], circumvented their sabotage, things are going to get, [sleepily], dangerous for both of us really, [trailing off], really fast...
658. [empathetically] Pack whatever you need from your desk because you're, [very sincerely], coming with me to the D.A.'s office right now. [short pause]
659. [determined] Well, um, we're going to, [proud], expose every single person involved in this and, er, I mean, make sure they never compromise another case or, [enunciating every word], destroy another family's hope for justice again. [long pause]
660. [bitter] Well, uh, it took me three years of searching and hiring a private investigator with my college fund to, [angry], track down the woman who used to read me bedtime stories.
661. [frustrated] So, like, what am I supposed to do, just pretend that my godmother didn't, [confused], abandon me when I was twelve without any, [loudly], explanation whatsoever? [groan]
662. [coldly] Those good times feel like lies now when I see, [disgusted], what you've become, when I understand that you chose, [very quietly], this over being part of my life.
663. [sarcastic] Right, because becoming a call girl was obviously the, [mocking], only option available to someone with a master's degree in, [bitterly], social work who used to counsel troubled teens.
664. [stunned] My mother's bills were covered by insurance and Dad's, [whispering loudly], pension, so that's just another lie you're telling yourself to, [slowly], justify choices you're too ashamed to actually own.
665. [crying while speaking] I mean, um, even if that's true, you could have, [passionately], told me something instead of just vanishing and leaving me to wonder if I'd, [broken], done something wrong to drive you away. [sniffle]
666. [desperate] Well, uh, then help me understand because I've spent, [pleading], six years trying to figure out why someone who claimed to, [quickly], love me could just erase themselves from my existence. [laugh bitterly]
667. [relieved] You know, um, I actually thought maybe you were, [curious], dead because that seemed easier to accept than you, [speeding up], choosing to abandon me.
668. [upset] Um, well, the woman who taught me to be brave and, [stern], honest apparently forgot those lessons herself when things got, [high-pitched], difficult and chose the coward's way out instead.
669. [resigned] I came here hoping for closure but all I found was, [disappointed], more questions wrapped in half-truths from someone I don't, [very slowly], recognize anymore who keeps hinting at secrets she'll never actually, [hollow], reveal.
670. [subdued] I don't know what you're [hesitantly] talking about, ma'am, I'm just here to pick up some paperwork about my denied application.
671. [quietly] Look, um, I was just doing my job, you know, anyone with hazmat training would've, [shaky voice], done the same thing in that situation. [sigh]
672. [apologetic] Well, um, I appreciate that, but, like, right now I'm just trying to, [frustrated], figure out why my application keeps getting, [bitter], rejected when I served four years in the Army Chemical Corps and should, [anxious], qualify for these benefits, you know?
673. [exhausted] Yeah, well, I've been trying to, um, fix this for eighteen months while, [desperately], working sixty-hour weeks driving hazmat loads to, like, [monotone], pay for community college one class at a time. [cough]
