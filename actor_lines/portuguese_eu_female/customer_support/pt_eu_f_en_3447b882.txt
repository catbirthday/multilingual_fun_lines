=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so... let me see here... I've called four times and, uh, nobody's actually... hmm, nobody gets what I'm saying.

Customer Support [en]: I hear you—I hear you completely, and um, I'm pulling up your account right now with reference number REF-9942-TK, so let's—let's start fresh here and I promise I'm listening to every word you're telling me.

Customer [en]: Wait. You're... you're actually looking? At my actual case?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, yes, I've got case number CSE-4481-MN right here on my screen and I can see the previous interactions you've had, which, um, honestly don't look like they addressed your core issue at all.

Customer [en]: Oh my God. Yes. That's... hmm, that's exactly it. Nobody sees it.

Customer Support [en]: So the—no wait, let me just—okay okay, the thing is, your original request from ticket TKT-7703-JP got misrouted to billing when it's clearly—it's clearly a technical issue, and that's why you've been getting nowhere.

Customer [en]: I KNEW it. Let me think... um, yeah, the router thing, uh, that's what started everything.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, exactly, and um, so what happened is—uh, when you mentioned the, the router error code ERR-5501, that should've immediately flagged for technical support, not billing, so let's get this sorted properly.

Customer [en]: Um, you're like, uh, the first person who even knows what that code means. Seriously.

Customer Support [en]: Well, I mean, that's—that's literally my job, but um, I appreciate that, and look, I'm gonna get this fixed today with priority escalation PRI-8827-QX, no more runaround.

Customer [en]: Today? You can... hmm, wait, you can actually do something today?

Customer Support [en]: I can—no actually, let me—I can and I will, because um, looking at your account history under customer ID CUS-9903-LL, you've been dealing with this for three weeks, which is, uh, completely unacceptable.

Customer [en]: Three weeks. Um, yeah. Let me see... kids can't do homework, I can't work... it's been, uh, rough.

Customer Support [en]: Oh that's—that's terrible, and um, completely understand why you're frustrated, so here's what I'm doing right now—I'm bypassing the normal queue and creating direct dispatch order DSP-6672-RW for a tech to come tomorrow morning.

Customer [en]: Um, tomorrow? Like, uh, actually tomorrow? Not "tomorrow" meaning next week?

Customer Support [en]: Tomorrow tomorrow—I mean, literally tomorrow, um, between 8 and 10 AM, and I'm putting my direct extension EXT-4429 in your file so if anything goes wrong, you call me directly.

Customer [en]: I'm gonna... hmm, okay so, uh, I might actually cry. You're actually helping.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, it's—it's what should've happened from the start, and um, I'm also adding service credit SVC-3381-PP to your account for the inconvenience, which should show up within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: You're um, you're incredible. Like, uh, seriously. Thank you for, hmm, for listening.

Customer Support [en]: That's really—I mean, that's kind of you to say, and um, just remember you've got confirmation number CNF-7745-XM for everything we discussed, and uh, genuinely, call me if you need anything else, okay okay?
