=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So um. Great. Bot couldn't. Uh. Get my account. Number right. Again.

Customer Support [en]: Oh um, I'm so sorry about that, uh, let me just pull up your info here and we'll get this sorted right away, what's your account number?

Customer [en]: It's um, basically like, eight. Seven. Two. Nine. Uh, four. Six. Three.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, um, account ACC-872-9463, and uh, I can see here that you've called, hmm, three times this week? That's, er, that's really frustrating, I'm gonna make sure we fix this permanently.

Customer [en]: Yeah so like. I think. Um. It hears "seven" as. "Kevin" or something? I dunno. Probably my fault.

Customer Support [en]: No no, um, absolutely not your fault, uh, the system has issues with ACC-872-9463 specifically because, er, the seven-two combo gets flagged as, hmm, potentially invalid, which is ridiculous.

Customer [en]: Of course. Um. Software engineer here. So like. I get it. Bad. Uh. Voice recognition. Classic.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, um, so what I'm gonna do is, uh, add a note here under ticket TKT-9982-VX that says, er, bypass voice verification for this account, and hmm, I'm also setting up a direct dial code.

Customer [en]: Wait you can. Um. Actually do that? Like really?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, um, your new direct code is gonna be DRC-4421-K, so uh, next time you call, just press star-nine and enter that, totally skips the bot.

Customer [en]: That's. Uh. Wow. Actually um, like, super helpful? I think?

Customer Support [en]: Good good, and um, I'm also seeing here in your history that, uh, you had an issue with order ORD-7739-PL last month that, er, also got stuck in the automated system?

Customer [en]: Oh yeah so basically. Um. That was. Uh. Fun times. Not.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah I can imagine, um, so what I'm doing right now is, uh, linking both these cases under master ticket MST-8847-QZ2, and er, flagging your whole account for manual review priority.

Customer [en]: Honestly like. You're um. Sort of. The first person who. Uh. Actually gets it?

Customer Support [en]: I mean, um, I deal with this system every day and uh, between you and me? It drives me crazy too, er, especially when I see accounts like ACC-872-9463 just stuck in loops.

Customer [en]: So um. What I need today. Is basically. Er. Just my last invoice?

Customer Support [en]: Of course, um, invoice INV-20241-RK8 right? I'm uh, emailing that now, and er, I'm also gonna send you my direct extension, it's 4421, just in case.

Customer [en]: You're like. Um. Literally saving me. From calling. Uh. Kevin-two-Kevin-four. Ever again.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, um, and hey, I put a permanent note in your file that says, er, "escalate immediately if voice system fails," with reference REF-8829-TK, so uh, anyone who gets your call will see it right away.
