=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi there! So I'm calling about this, uh, expense report that got—well, it came back denied and I just thought maybe we could...

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, let me, um, pull that up. Need your, uh, employee ID first.

Customer [en]: Oh sure, it's, um, let me see here... E-4-7-2-9. Sorry, I mean E-4-7-3-9!

Customer Support [en]: Got it. E-4739. Um, looking here... expense report EXP-2024-1182, submitted, uh, last Tuesday. Give me just... okay okay, seeing the denial code.

Customer [en]: Yeah, so like, I know you're probably busy but, um, it was just for team snacks after the tournament and I thought that was—

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so, um, the code here is, uh, NC-447 which is... hmm... "non-covered athletic expense." System's showing, um, snacks aren't in the approved category under, uh, policy ATH-9921-B.

Customer [en]: Oh. Well that's... I mean other coaches have definitely gotten snacks reimbursed before, so I just assumed...

Customer Support [en]: Um, yeah, I'm, uh, really sorry about this. Let me just... diving deeper here... transaction TXN-88142-QV shows $47.82 at, um, Price Mart?

Customer [en]: Right, exactly! And like, these kids just played their hearts out for three hours, you know? I mean, we can't just send them home hungry after all that...

Customer Support [en]: I'm, uh, I'm checking the guidelines and, um, it's it's pretty strict on this. Really sorry. The, uh, the policy revision from January made it, um, more restrictive.

Customer [en]: Okay but wait, sorry, can we just—I mean, Head Coach Martinez literally told me to buy the snacks. Like, explicitly said "go get snacks for the kids"...

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Oh that's, um, different then. Let me, uh, add a note here. If you have, um, authorization from—wait, Martinez, that's that's department head level, right?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah! Exactly! So like, I'm not trying to be difficult here but I basically got thrown under the bus for following instructions, which seems...

Customer Support [en]: No no, you're, uh, you're absolutely right. I'm um, really sorry about this. Let me, uh, flag this for review with code SUP-AUTH-01. That that changes things.

Customer [en]: Oh good! Because honestly? I was about to just—I mean, forty-seven bucks isn't gonna break me but it's the principle of it, right?

Customer Support [en]: Totally totally get it. Um, so I'm, uh, escalating to claims review with reference REF-6639-MZ. They'll, um, they'll need Coach Martinez to, uh, confirm the authorization but then it should should process.

Customer [en]: Perfect! See, I knew there had to be some way to... And hey, thanks for actually listening, you know? Some people just shut you down immediately.

Customer Support [en]: Of course, um, happy to help. The the review takes, uh, usually 3-5 days and you'll get, um, an email to case number CSE-10847-RT when it's, uh, when it's resolved.

Customer [en]: That's great, really appreciate it. Oh and um, just curious—going forward, is there like a different code I should use for team snacks or...?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, for future, use, uh, category code CAT-18 "team morale" instead of CAT-22 "equipment." That that should, um, prevent this. Added a note to your profile, EMP-4739-NOTE.
