=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, I need to... what's the word... escalate this. My medication. It's, uh, it's not here and I'm almost out.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, I completely get it—my mom's diabetic so I know how scary that is when meds run low. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your order number?

Customer [en]: It's, um... hold on... ORD-4472-BN. I've been a customer for, uh, six years. This is... what do you call it... unacceptable.

Customer Support [en]: Got that, um, ORD-4472-BN and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that it's... oh. Okay so, um, there's a delay and I'm really, really sorry about this...

Customer [en]: A delay? I have two pills left. Two.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know, this is, um, this is awful and I'm just... let me check the tracking, it's showing, uh, package ID PKG-77293-XM is stuck at the distribution center since...

Customer [en]: Since when? This is, um... how do I put this... life or death. Not, uh, not some random package.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: I mean, um, I've never missed a payment. Ever. And now you're, uh, telling me... what exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, honestly? I'm gonna level with you here—the system shows it's been sitting there for, uh, three days, tracking number TRK-882916-L, and that's just... I mean, that shouldn't happen...

Customer [en]: Three days. While I'm rationing medication.

Customer Support [en]: Listen, I'm, um, I'm putting in an emergency override right now, reference number REF-9982-QK12, and, uh, calling the distribution center directly which I don't usually...

Customer [en]: You can do that? Will it... will it actually help?

Customer Support [en]: Between you and me? I used to work dispatch before this, so I know exactly who to call. Your prescription RX-4419-MED is getting flagged for same-day courier service.

Customer [en]: Um, same-day? Like... today? You're, uh, you're sure about that?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. Confirmation code CNF-20847-A will pop up in your email, should be there within four hours, five max.

Customer [en]: I... okay. That would work. That would actually work.

Customer Support [en]: And hey, um, I'm also adding a credit, code CRD-445-RUSH, for the, uh, for the whole mess, because this just... this never should've...

Customer [en]: Thank you. Really. I was starting to think nobody there understood.

Customer Support [en]: No no, I get it completely. Keep that reference number REF-9982-QK12 just in case, but you should be all set by this afternoon.
