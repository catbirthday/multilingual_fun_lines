=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi. I need to, uh... cancel something? It's, er, really embarrassing actually.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that... let me just, uh, pull up your account here if you could... actually, what's your account number or email, if that's...

Customer [en]: It's jen.morales at gmail. The subscription. For the teeth whitening kit.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm seeing here account ACC-34892-JM and, uh, the BrightSmile monthly subscription... oh, hmm, it looks like it's been active since, um, let me see here...

Customer [en]: Six months. Um. Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm actually a dental hygienist? So this is, er, particularly mortifying.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, I completely understand that feeling... you know, I once had a gym membership going for eight months that I never... anyway, let me get this sorted for you right away, reference number REF-2024-88291 for this cancellation...

Customer [en]: Wait. Eight months? Um. Okay. That, uh... that does make me feel. Slightly better.

Customer Support [en]: Right? Um, it happens to literally everyone, and honestly, uh, between you and me? The system should really, um, send better reminders... let me just, er, process this cancellation here...

Customer [en]: Classic. Dental professional. Can't manage her own dental subscriptions.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no no, um, please don't be hard on yourself... I'm looking at your history here, order ORD-7745-DK, and, uh, actually I think I can... hmm, would you like me to see about a partial refund since you haven't, um, placed any product orders in the last four months?

Customer [en]: You can, um. You can do that? Really? I just, er... figured it was my fault.

Customer Support [en]: So here's what I'm going to do—and this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I'm submitting a refund request RFQ-55812-X for the last three months, because honestly our system should have flagged this inactive account...

Customer [en]: That's. Um. Wow. I wasn't expecting... er, thank you?

Customer Support [en]: Of course, of course... um, and actually, let me also, uh, add a note here to your file, note ID NTE-99847-JM, so if you ever, um, need anything in the future, any agent will see that you're... well, that we should've done better...

Customer [en]: Funny thing is. We sell these kits. At my office. For twice the price.

Customer Support [en]: Oh my goodness, see? That's exactly why I'm making sure you get this refund... okay so confirmation code CNF-44509-BB for the cancellation, and you should see that refund in three to five business days...

Customer [en]: Three to five days. Got it. Thanks for not. You know. Judging.

Customer Support [en]: Never, never... we've all been there, trust me... is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other subscriptions you want me to check on while we're here?

Customer [en]: Just the one expensive mistake. But. Yeah. Thanks for being cool about it.

Customer Support [en]: You're so welcome... and hey, your case number CSE-88462-JM is in your email now, and honestly? Six months is nothing compared to some of the stories I could tell you... you take care, okay?
