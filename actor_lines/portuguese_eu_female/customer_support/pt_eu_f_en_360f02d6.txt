=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So um, I'm looking at my bill here and, uh, it's like... what's the word... itemized? Need that.

Customer Support [en]: Oh yeah, totally get that. Um, I actually had the same thing happen with my phone bill last month. Let me pull up your account... got it, account number ACC-4492-NJ. So what specific charges are confusing?

Customer [en]: Well basically, um, there's all these... hmm, let me see here... fees? Extra ones.

Customer Support [en]: Right, um, so looking at your invoice INV-88204-K here, I can see, uh, there's definitely a few line items. Um, honestly, some of these fees are, well, they're not super clear even to me sometimes. Let me break each one down.

Customer [en]: Wait, you don't know them either?

Customer Support [en]: Ha, um, I mean, I know them now but, uh, when I first started? Complete mystery. Okay so, um, your base service is forty-nine ninety-nine, then there's, uh, the regulatory recovery fee of three dollars twelve cents.

Customer [en]: So that's like... hmm, what if... okay so that means fifty-three something?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly, yeah. But then there's more. The, um, network access fee of seven fifty, and then, uh, your equipment lease for the router, that's twelve dollars. All showing on statement STM-7739-PQ.

Customer [en]: Equipment? But I... um, hmm, did I rent something?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, yeah, that's the modem we sent. Uh, lot of people forget about that one. Then there's, um, the broadcast TV surcharge of nineteen ninety-five, and, uh, the regional sports fee of eight fifty.

Customer [en]: Wait, really? Sports? But I don't... I don't watch sports.

Customer Support [en]: I know, right? Um, it's honestly kind of ridiculous but, uh, everyone gets charged that in your ZIP code. Even my grandma who only watches cooking shows. Reference number REF-2210-BX shows it's mandatory for your area.

Customer [en]: So basically what happened is like... they just add stuff?

Customer Support [en]: Pretty much. Oh wait, that's weird. There's also a, um, convenience fee of four ninety-nine on transaction TXN-889204431 that, uh, shouldn't be there if you're on autopay.

Customer [en]: Autopay? Um, I thought I... so like... am I not on that?

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, let me check... uh, okay so this is interesting. You're, um, enrolled in autopay but it's not, uh, it's not active? System code SYS-1147-D says pending verification.

Customer [en]: Oh! Wait, really? That explains it!

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, once we fix that, you'll save the four ninety-nine monthly. Want me to, uh, activate it now? Just need to confirm the payment method on file PAY-6621-RT.

Customer [en]: Yes! Um, so that means... hmm, let me see here... I save sixty a year?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly sixty bucks, yeah. Um, and honestly? I'm gonna credit back the last three months of those fees too. Credit confirmation CRD-445789 will show up in, uh, two to three days. My manager might not love it but, um, you shouldn't have been charged those.
