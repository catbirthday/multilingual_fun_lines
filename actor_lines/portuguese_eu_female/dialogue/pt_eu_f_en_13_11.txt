Character 1 [en]: So, um, I heard you've been, like, composing something new lately, you know, for the symphony?

Character 2 [en]: Well, it's... actually, it's not [very quietly] a symphony exactly, more like, hmm, a sonic meditation? Picture waves crashing but—reversed, time folding backwards into silence, each note dissolving before it's born.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds, uh, really abstract, I mean, how do you even, er, write that down?

Character 2 [en]: Oh! Traditional notation is—well, it's [high-pitched] useless for this, basically, so I invented my own system? Colors become dynamics, shapes transform into timbre... the score looks more like abstract art than music!

Character 1 [en]: I can't even [crying while speaking] imagine how beautiful that must sound.

Character 2 [en]: Beauty isn't... it's not the goal? I'm chasing something more primal—that moment between sleeping and waking where reality gets... slippery, bendable, where sound becomes physical and touches you from inside.

Character 1 [en]: Do you, like, actually hear all this stuff, I guess, in your head before, um, you write it?

Character 2 [en]: Constantly! My brain is—okay so, imagine a radio, right, but tuned to, er, seventeen stations simultaneously? Melodies cascade and collide, rhythms multiply... sometimes I forget which sounds are real and which are just... mine.

Character 1 [en]: That must be overwhelming.

Character 2 [en]: Overwhelming is... underselling it? Yesterday I heard a garbage truck's brakes and suddenly understood Mahler's ninth symphony—not intellectually but cellularly, like my bones were vibrating at the exact frequency of human grief!

Character 1 [en]: Could you [shy] maybe play something for me?

Character 2 [en]: Playing implies... linearity? What I do is more like—sculpting air, bending physics... but sure, close your eyes and I'll show you how Tuesday sounds when it's angry.

Character 1 [en]: Tuesday sounds, hmm, angry? That's, [joking] well, the thing is, pretty specific for, you know, a weekday emotion!

Character 2 [en]: Every day has its own harmonic signature! Tuesday vibrates at 247 hertz—frustrated, impatient, leaning forward... Monday is lower, resigned at 196, while Saturday? Saturday screams at 440, pure possibility!

Character 1 [en]: How did you, um, discover this, I mean, like, musical consciousness thing anyway?

Character 2 [en]: Discovered implies choice? I was seven, practicing scales, when suddenly each note... split open, revealed infinite notes inside, fractals of sound spiraling endlessly inward—I've been chasing that rabbit hole ever since!

Character 1 [en]: Wait, you can [whispering loudly] actually hear infinite variations?

Character 2 [en]: Not hear—experience! It's synesthetic chaos where C major tastes purple and minor sevenths smell like rain... my nervous system is basically a mixing board for reality's hidden frequencies!

Character 1 [en]: This is absolutely blowing my mind right now.

Character 2 [en]: Mind-blowing is, er, just the beginning—wait until you realize, honestly, that reality itself is, you know, music... just vibrations pretending to be solid, and we're all, um, just notes in some cosmic composition nobody's listening to!
