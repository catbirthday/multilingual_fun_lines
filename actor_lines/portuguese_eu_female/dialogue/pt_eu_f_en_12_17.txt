Character 1 [en]: [yawn] Sorry, is anyone sitting here? The other deck chairs are, um, all taken and I just—I didn't want to stand for the whole sunset.

Character 2 [en]: Oh! No, no, please—sit, absolutely. I've been, uhh, I've been kind of sprawled out here like some sort of... mmm, what's the word... territorial seagull? God, that's embarrassing. The crew keeps bringing drinks and I keep, you know, spreading out more.

Character 1 [en]: You're the marine biologist, aren't you? From the announcement?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah! Oh wow, you were actually—were you listening to that? Most people just, like, totally zone out when I start going on about, um, bioluminescent plankton and stuff. But tonight we might—actually wait, if the conditions are right? We might really see them!

Character 1 [en]: Wait, the water's going to glow?

Character 2 [en]: If we're lucky, yeah, it's—okay so, it's basically like nature's own light show, you know? When the boat cuts through the water it kind of, uhh, disturbs these tiny little organisms and they literally—I mean literally—light up this crazy blue-green color.

Character 1 [en]: That's why you picked this specific cruise.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly, yeah. New moon tonight, warm water, and we're—we're passing through this zone where I've, hmm, documented blooms before? Plus, well... my ex-husband owns the company, so. Discount. Gotta find those silver linings in divorce, I guess.

Character 1 [en]: Oh wow, that's... actually kind of badass.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, I don't know about badass—more like, uhh, strategically petty? He gets half my research grant money, I get to use his boats for field observations. Though honestly I'm—I mostly came tonight because it's my birthday and sitting at home felt, you know, too depressing.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] It's your birthday? Today?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, yeah. The big 4-0. Hence the whole, um, territorial seagull thing and the—the multiple drinks situation. Nothing says midlife crisis quite like getting drunk alone on your ex's boat while waiting for, like, glowing algae to show up, right?

Character 1 [en]: Can I tell you something weird?

Character 2 [en]: Weirder than me just, like, trauma-dumping on a complete stranger while hogging the best seats? I mean, the bar's pretty high at this point, so—yeah, shoot. I'm emotionally prepared for literally anything.

Character 1 [en]: It's my fortieth birthday too. Today.

Character 2 [en]: [stuttering] W-wait, what? No. No no no, you're—are you being serious right now? Because if you're just, I mean, if you're saying that to make me feel better? That's sweet but also, uhh, kind of unnecessarily creepy, honestly.

Character 1 [en]: October fifteenth, 1984. Miami General Hospital, if that helps.

Character 2 [en]: Shut up. Shut—okay, I was born at Miami General! This is genuinely—this is freaking me out now. What time? Because I was 11:47 PM and if you say anywhere near that, I might, like, literally jump overboard or something.

Character 1 [en]: 11:51! Four minutes apart! This is insane!

Character 2 [en]: Oh my god, we were probably—we were in the same nursery! Our parents might've, like, passed each other in the hallway or something! Okay universe, I get it—message received. Sometimes you don't spend your birthday alone, you spend it with your... what, cosmic birthday twin? Is that a thing?
