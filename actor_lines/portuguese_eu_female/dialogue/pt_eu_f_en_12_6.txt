Character 1 [en]: Working from home is driving me absolutely insane!

Character 2 [en]: Oh no, well, what's been the, um, [friendly] biggest challenge for you? I mean, the transition can be rough, especially when you're used to, you know, having that physical separation between work and home life.

Character 1 [en]: I just— uh, I can't stop working! Like, my laptop's right there and I'm, er, constantly checking emails at midnight!

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, that's so common, honestly! The thing is, without those physical boundaries, your brain basically never switches off, and you kind of end up in this perpetual work mode that's, well, exhausting.

Character 1 [en]: And I, umm, [very sad] miss people so much! You know, I haven't had a real conversation with a coworker in, like, weeks except through, I guess, these stupid video calls!

Character 2 [en]: Actually, that isolation is, uh, [very quietly] one of the hardest parts that nobody really talks about enough. I mean, we're social creatures, and those water cooler chats, err, they matter more than we realized, don't they?

Character 1 [en]: Yes! Exactly! And my cat, hmm, [happy] thinks every video call is for her! She's basically become my, you know, unofficial coworker at this point!

Character 2 [en]: Haha, okay so, pets becoming coworkers is like, the most relatable thing ever! Mine, well, my dog has crashed so many meetings that my team just, uhh, expects him to make an appearance now.

Character 1 [en]: Do you, um, ever feel like you're losing your mind? Sort of talking to yourself all day, I mean, because there's nobody else around?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, the thing is, I've had full conversations with my houseplants! Actually, sometimes I narrate what I'm doing just to, you know, hear a human voice even if it's, er, my own.

Character 1 [en]: And don't even get me started on wearing pajama pants to meetings!

Character 2 [en]: Right? The whole "business on top, comfort on bottom" situation has become this universal secret that everyone knows but nobody acknowledges on calls!

Character 1 [en]: I, uhh, tried setting up a proper office space but honestly, I still end up working from bed half the time anyway!

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, here's the thing though, your brain needs those location cues, you know? But I get it, sometimes the bed just, well, calls to you, especially when it's cold and your heating bill is already ridiculous!

Character 1 [en]: My back is killing me from this terrible desk setup!

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, investing in a good chair changed my life, seriously! It seems expensive at first but when you calculate the chiropractor visits you're preventing, it actually pays for itself pretty quickly.

Character 1 [en]: How do you, like, actually stop working at the end of the day? I mean, there's no commute to, sort of, decompress anymore!

Character 2 [en]: So I've started doing this fake commute thing where I, um, [apologetic] walk around the block before and after work? It sounds ridiculous, but it actually helps signal to my brain that work is starting or ending, even though I'm just coming back to the same place!

Character 1 [en]: That's— hmm, that's actually brilliant! Do you, er, ever feel guilty though, like when you take breaks during the day?

Character 2 [en]: All the time, honestly! But here's the thing, we need to remember that in an office we weren't productive for eight hours straight either, you know? We had coffee breaks, chatted with people, basically took mental breaks constantly, so it's actually normal and healthy!
