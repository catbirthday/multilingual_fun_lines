Character 1 [en]: So, um, I heard you're, like, opening your own bar next month, actually?

Character 2 [en]: Yes! After twelve years behind other people's [speeding up] bars, I finally secured the investors and found the perfect location downtown near the arts district.

Character 1 [en]: That's, well, incredible, you know, I mean, your own place finally.

Character 2 [en]: It's been a long journey, honestly, from washing glasses at dive bars to, er, studying mixology in Tokyo, but every step taught me something essential about this craft.

Character 1 [en]: Uh, how much did you, basically, have to save up for this, I guess?

Character 2 [en]: Between my savings and three angel investors, we raised about four hundred thousand, which covers renovation, licensing, initial inventory, and six months of operating expenses.

Character 1 [en]: Four hundred thousand dollars?

Character 2 [en]: I know it sounds [very slowly] like a lot, but, hmm, the profit margins in this industry are actually quite good if you, well, manage inventory properly and create the right atmosphere.

Character 1 [en]: What's your [very quickly] concept going to be?

Character 2 [en]: Pre-Prohibition era cocktails with, um, modern techniques, featuring house-made bitters and, sort of, locally sourced ingredients, plus we'll have live jazz Thursday through Saturday nights.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds sophisticated.

Character 2 [en]: Sophisticated but approachable is exactly what we're aiming for, with cocktails ranging from twelve to eighteen dollars and a strong emphasis on educating customers about cocktail history.

Character 1 [en]: Er, are you nervous about, you know, failing or, honestly, losing everything?

Character 2 [en]: Of course I'm nervous, but fear [mumbling] of failure can't stop you from pursuing your dreams, and I've planned for every contingency I can think of.

Character 1 [en]: Well, what if, uhh, nobody shows up, I mean, on opening night or whatever?

Character 2 [en]: We've already pre-sold two hundred tickets [confidently] for our soft opening, and my regular customers from my current bar have been spreading the word for months.

Character 1 [en]: You pre-sold tickets to a bar opening?

Character 2 [en]: It includes five craft cocktails, [sneeze] appetizers, and live entertainment, so it's really more of an exclusive tasting event than just a regular opening.

Character 1 [en]: I'm, actually, really [very melancholic] proud of you, you know, for achieving this, honestly.

Character 2 [en]: Thank you, that means everything. This dream started [hesitantly] fifteen years ago when I was just a broke college student who loved making drinks, and now it's actually happening.
