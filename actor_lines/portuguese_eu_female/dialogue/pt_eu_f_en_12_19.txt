Character 1 [en]: Is this where the morning meditation session is happening?

Character 2 [en]: Yes, absolutely! We're just about to begin actually. The energy here this morning is incredible—everyone's been talking about how clear and peaceful they feel after yesterday's sound bath ceremony.

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] Oh my god, I can't believe I finally made it here!

Character 2 [en]: [stuttering] I—I totally understand that excitement! The journey to get here can be quite the adventure. Most people feel that same rush of joy when they first step onto the property and realize they're finally disconnecting.

Character 1 [en]: Sorry, I didn't mean to yell. It's just been such a long year.

Character 2 [en]: [belly laugh] Don't apologize for expressing pure joy! That's exactly what this space is for. You should hear the screams during our primal release sessions on Thursdays—now those get properly loud.

Character 1 [en]: Primal release? What exactly happens there?

Character 2 [en]: It's this beautiful practice where we let out all the stuck emotions through movement and sound. People dance, yell, cry, laugh—whatever needs to come out. It's incredibly cathartic and honestly one of our most popular sessions.

Character 1 [en]: That sounds either terrifying or amazing.

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Between you and me, it's absolutely both. The first time I did it, I cried for twenty minutes straight and then felt lighter than I had in years. Sometimes healing looks messy.

Character 1 [en]: How long have you been leading retreats here?

Character 2 [en]: Three years now, and every single group brings something unique. Last week we had a CEO who hadn't taken a real break in a decade—she spent the first day just sleeping under the oak tree.

Character 1 [en]: [speeding up] Wait, we can just sleep wherever we want during the day?

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Oh no, absolutely not, we have very strict nap schedules and designated sleeping zones! I'm kidding—of course you can rest anywhere. This whole place is designed for you to listen to exactly what your body needs.

Character 1 [en]: That's such a relief. I was worried about all the rules and schedules.

Character 2 [en]: We have a loose structure just to offer opportunities, but nothing's mandatory except being kind to yourself. Some people do every single activity, others spend the whole weekend reading by the pond. Both are perfect.

Character 1 [en]: I brought four self-help books. Too much?

Character 2 [en]: Not at all! Though you might find you don't need them as much as you think. Something about this place makes people realize they already have most of the answers inside—the books just confirm what you already know.

Character 1 [en]: That's beautifully put. I already feel different just standing here.

Character 2 [en]: [very meekly] That means more than you know... Sometimes I still can't believe I get to witness these transformations every week. It never gets old seeing someone reconnect with their peace.
