Character 1 [mix]: Não disseste uma palavra desde que saímos do cemitério.

Character 2 [mix]: O que é que queres exactamente que eu diga? Que estou [curious] surpresa que finalmente apareceste depois de 3 anos? Your timing's impeccable—já não pode ficar desiludida contigo.

Character 1 [mix]: Isso não é... Jesus, isso não é justo.

Character 2 [mix]: Justo? Queres falar sobre o que é justo? Ela esperou, sabes, todos os feriados, todos os aniversários—raios, she even kept your ridiculous tea collection thinking you'd come back for it.

Character 1 [mix]: Eu não podia simplesmente—

Character 2 [mix]: Não podias o quê? Pegar no telefone? Mandar uma carta? Desapareceste como se ela não significasse nada, and now you show up with grocery-store flowers expecting absolution from a headstone.

Character 1 [mix]: As flores eram, bem, tudo o que tinham, e quer dizer... eu não sabia que ela estava doente.

Character 2 [mix]: Claro que não sabias! Tens de estar presente na vida de alguém para saber coisas—é assim que as relações funcionam, basicamente.

Character 1 [mix]: Para. Pára com isso.

Character 2 [mix]: Porquê? Porque a verdade te deixa desconfortável? Tu ensinaste-me esse truque, lembras-te—fugir quando as coisas ficam demasiado reais, demasiado complicadas.

Character 1 [mix]: Nunca quis magoar ninguém.

Character 2 [mix]: As intenções não apagam os estragos. But you always were [flirtatious] good at convincing yourself otherwise, weren't you? Esse teu charme—funciona com toda a gente excepto as pessoas que realmente te conheciam.

Character 1 [mix]: Porque é que estás a fazer isto?

Character 2 [mix]: Porque alguém precisa de o dizer! Everyone else will pat your shoulder and tell you grief is complicated, mas eu não vou fingir que a tua ausência não acelerou tudo.

Character 1 [mix]: Eu sei que falhei com ela! Eu sei, está bem? Penso nisso todos os—Deus, nem consigo [cry loudly] respirar quando penso nos últimos meses dela... a perguntar-se se eu ia aparecer, basicamente.

Character 2 [mix]: Parabéns pela tua culpa. Too bad it's about three years and six feet too late to matter to anyone but you.

Character 1 [mix]: Ela era [very sad] a minha mãe também.

Character 2 [mix]: Não. As mães recebem visitas, telefonemas, presença. What you had was a biological connection you treated like an inconvenience until it was gone.

Character 1 [mix]: Estou a tentar fazer as coisas bem.

Character 2 [mix]: Com quem? Ela está morta. Eu acabei contigo. And those pathetic carnations are already wilting—até elas sabem quando algo é inútil.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: You haven't said a word since we left the cemetery.

Character 2: What exactly do you want me to say? That I'm [curious] surprised you finally showed up after three years? Your timing's impeccable—she can't exactly be disappointed in you anymore.

Character 1: That's not... Jesus, that's not fair.

Character 2: Fair? You want to, um, talk about fair? She waited, you know, every holiday, every birthday—hell, she even kept your, basically, ridiculous tea collection thinking you'd come back for it.

Character 1: I couldn't just—

Character 2: Couldn't what? Pick up a phone? Send a letter? You disappeared like she meant nothing, and now you show up with grocery-store flowers expecting absolution from a headstone.

Character 1: The flowers were, well, all they had left, and I mean... I didn't know she was sick.

Character 2: Of course you didn't know! You have to actually, er, be present in someone's life to, you know, know things—that's how, basically, relationships work.

Character 1: Stop. Just stop.

Character 2: Why? Because the truth makes you uncomfortable? You taught me that trick, remember—running away when things get too real, too complicated.

Character 1: I never meant to hurt anyone.

Character 2: Intentions don't erase damage. But you always were [flirtatious] good at convincing yourself otherwise, weren't you? That charm of yours—it works on everyone except the people who actually knew you.

Character 1: Why are you doing this?

Character 2: Because someone needs to say it! Everyone else will pat your shoulder and tell you grief is complicated, but I won't pretend your absence didn't accelerate everything.

Character 1: I know I failed her! I know, okay? I, um, think about it every—God, I can't even, like, [cry loudly] breathe when I think about her last months... wondering if I'd, basically, show up.

Character 2: Congratulations on your guilt. Too bad it's about three years and six feet too late to matter to anyone but you.

Character 1: She was [very sad] my mother too.

Character 2: No. Mothers get visits, phone calls, presence. What you had was a biological connection you treated like an inconvenience until it was gone.

Character 1: I'm trying to make things right.

Character 2: With who? She's dead. I'm done. And those pathetic carnations are already wilting—even they know when something's pointless.
