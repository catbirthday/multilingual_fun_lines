Character 1 [en]: I just bought three guitars online. At midnight. While drunk.

Character 2 [en]: Oh wow, umm, okay three guitars at once is... that's definitely a commitment. Are we talking like, expensive ones or more entry-level stuff here?

Character 1 [en]: Two Gibsons and a vintage Fender. Twenty thousand total.

Character 2 [en]: [gasp softly] Twenty thou— holy shit, that's like, that's a car. That's literally a decent car right there. Have you, uh, told anyone else about this yet?

Character 1 [en]: Just you. Can't return them. Final sale.

Character 2 [en]: Eesh, yeah, vintage stuff is usually, I mean, they don't mess around with returns on those. But honestly, if you're having second thoughts, maybe you could flip them? Guitar values are pretty stable.

Character 1 [en]: I don't even play guitar.

Character 2 [en]: You don't— wait, hold on. You spent twenty grand on instruments you don't actually play? That's... huh, that's actually kind of fascinating in a way.

Character 1 [en]: [cough] Sometimes I just buy things. It feels good for like ten minutes.

Character 2 [en]: [overly polite] Oh, I completely understand that impulse, truly. Shopping releases dopamine and, well, when you're looking for that hit, sometimes rational thinking just goes right out the window, doesn't it?

Character 1 [en]: Last month it was watches. Seven watches.

Character 2 [en]: [very excited] Ooh watches! See, at least watches hold value really well! Some of them actually appreciate over time, so that's potentially more of an investment than just, you know, impulsive spending.

Character 1 [en]: I gave them all away. To strangers on the street.

Character 2 [en]: You just... handed out watches to random people? That's, uh, that's definitely one way to spread joy, I suppose. Must've made some folks pretty happy though.

Character 1 [en]: Do you think there's something wrong with me?

Character 2 [en]: Wrong is such a loaded word, honestly. I think maybe you're dealing with something and the buying is, like, a coping mechanism? Have you noticed any patterns about when these urges hit?

Character 1 [en]: Usually when I can't sleep. Everything feels urgent at 3am.

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] Oh man, yes! The 3am brain is absolutely not to be trusted with credit cards! Everything seems like the best idea ever at that hour, it's like your impulse control just completely shuts down.

Character 1 [en]: [extremely happy] You get it. Most people think I'm insane.

Character 2 [en]: [gasp softly] No no, you're not insane at all. You're just, mmm, maybe wired a little differently? And honestly, three guitars is way better than three timeshares or something actually harmful.
