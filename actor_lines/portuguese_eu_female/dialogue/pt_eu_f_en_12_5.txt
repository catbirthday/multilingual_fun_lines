Character 1 [en]: Oh god, I've been thinking about therapy but I'm— I'm completely freaking out about it!

Character 2 [en]: Hey, breathe! It's actually totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, you know, because opening up to someone new is scary, but therapists are trained to make you feel safe and comfortable from the very first moment.

Character 1 [en]: But I— I um, don't even know if I can like, form coherent sentences when I'm there, I'll probably just sort of ramble nonsensically!

Character 2 [en]: Well, that's perfectly fine, I mean, therapists are used to people being nervous! They'll basically help guide you through everything, ask gentle questions, and there's no wrong way to express yourself in that space.

Character 1 [en]: What if I— uh, what if I pick the wrong therapist and er, waste all my money? I guess that terrifies me!

Character 2 [en]: Most therapists offer brief consultations where you can get a feel for their style, and many will work with you on payment plans or sliding scales if cost is a concern.

Character 1 [en]: I keep— so, I keep imagining myself just honestly crying uncontrollably and kind of making a complete fool of myself!

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, here's the thing though, crying in therapy is really one of the most normal things ever! The thing is, therapists see it as healthy emotional processing, not embarrassing at all, and they're completely prepared for it.

Character 1 [en]: Oh god, but uhh, what if my problems are stupid? I mean, what if they think I'm being dramatic over nothing?

Character 2 [en]: Right so, no therapist worth their salt would ever think that, actually! If something's bothering you enough to seek help, you know, then it's valid and deserves attention, no matter how "small" it might seem.

Character 1 [en]: I can't even make phone calls without panicking— how am I supposed to schedule an appointment?!

Character 2 [en]: Well, many therapists honestly accept online booking now, like through their websites or apps! You can schedule without talking to anyone, and some even offer text or email communication for anxious clients.

Character 1 [en]: What if I start and then chicken out after one session?

Character 2 [en]: That's your choice and it's [formal] completely within your rights to stop whenever you feel necessary! Therapists understand that timing matters and they won't take it personally if you need to pause or stop.

Character 1 [en]: But everyone will know I'm broken if I go to therapy!

Character 2 [en]: Um, first off, therapy is [overly polite] extremely confidential, so nobody has to know unless you choose to tell them, you know? And sort of more importantly, going to therapy means you're taking care of yourself, not that you're broken.

Character 1 [en]: I just— I feel like such a mess even considering this!

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I'm so [apologetic] sorry you're feeling this way, but uh, can I tell you something? I mean, the fact that you're even considering getting help basically shows incredible self-awareness and strength.

Character 1 [en]: So you really think— like, you think I should just er, bite the bullet and do it even though I'm terrified?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, yes, because that fear you're feeling, well, it's just your brain trying to protect you from the unknown, but kind of ironically, therapy is exactly where you learn to handle fears like this!
