Character 1 [en]: Why are you even here? I told you I don't need help with the lighting.

Character 2 [en]: Hey, um, I just thought we could, [cheerful] you know, bounce some ideas around! I've been reading about how color temperature affects mood, and honestly, it's fascinating stuff.

Character 1 [en]: I don't care what you've been reading. This is my project.

Character 2 [en]: Okay, I get that you're protective of your vision, totally understandable. But didn't you mention last week that the client wasn't happy with the first mockup?

Character 1 [en]: That's— well, that's not, I mean, relevant anymore, actually.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes here, seriously. Just thought maybe a fresh perspective could help since you seemed stressed about the deadline.

Character 1 [en]: I'm not stressed, okay so, maybe the timeline is, er, tight, but like, I can handle it.

Character 2 [en]: Right, but you've got what, three days left? And you still haven't figured out the accent lighting for the main gallery space, have you?

Character 1 [en]: How do you even know that?

Character 2 [en]: Sarah mentioned it when I ran into her at the supply store yesterday. She said you were having trouble with the track lighting angles creating weird shadows.

Character 1 [en]: Sarah needs to, uhh, mind her own business, the thing is, she doesn't understand my approach.

Character 2 [en]: Your approach of, hmm, using only warm whites? I guess, that could work, but, you know, have you considered how that'll wash out the artwork, basically?

Character 1 [en]: Don't lecture me about color rendering.

Character 2 [en]: I'm not lecturing, just asking questions! You're using 2700K bulbs for contemporary art pieces that need crisp whites, aren't you?

Character 1 [en]: The client specifically asked for a warm, inviting atmosphere.

Character 2 [en]: Sure, but, well, warm doesn't have to mean, sort of, yellow, right? You could, anyway, mix in some 3500K spots for the actual artwork.

Character 1 [en]: I've been doing this for five years. I think I know what works.

Character 2 [en]: Five years of residential work though, right? Gallery lighting is a completely different beast with different requirements for color accuracy and drama.

Character 1 [en]: Are you seriously questioning my qualifications right now?

Character 2 [en]: Not questioning, just pointing out that this is your first gallery installation. Maybe being open to suggestions isn't the worst idea when the client's already expressed concerns?
