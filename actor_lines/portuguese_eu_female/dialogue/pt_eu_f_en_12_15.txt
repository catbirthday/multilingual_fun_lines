Character 1 [en]: You're telling me you actually saw him jump? From the bridge?

Character 2 [en]: No. No no no, he didn't jump—he dove. There's a difference, trust me. When someone jumps, there's hesitation, this awful moment of decision. But this guy? He executed a perfect swan dive like he'd been practicing his whole life for that exact moment.

Character 1 [en]: [trailing off] But the police report said...

Character 2 [en]: The police report said what they needed it to say. Look, I was there, alone on that bridge at 3 AM because I couldn't sleep. Nobody expects witnesses at that hour. Nobody plans for insomniacs who take midnight walks to clear their heads.

Character 1 [en]: Why didn't you try to stop him?

Character 2 [en]: Stop him? He was already in motion when I saw him—balanced on that railing like a gymnast, arms spread wide. By the time my brain registered what was happening, he was gone. Just... gone. And the silence afterward was the loudest thing I've ever heard.

Character 1 [en]: Did he say anything? Leave a note?

Character 2 [en]: That's the thing that haunts me. He looked right at me—direct eye contact—and smiled. Not a sad smile, not desperate. Peaceful. Like he'd finally figured out the answer to some impossible question that had been eating at him for years.

Character 1 [en]: You think he wanted you to see it.

Character 2 [en]: I know he did. Why else choose that exact spot, that exact time? The bridge has cameras everywhere except that one blind spot near the north tower. He knew someone would be there—maybe not me specifically, but someone who needed to witness it.

Character 1 [en]: This is insane. You're saying it was... what, performance art?

Character 2 [en]: Performance? No. Statement? Absolutely. Three days later, the news breaks about the pension fund scandal. Twenty thousand retirees lost everything. And guess whose signature was on every single fraudulent document?

Character 1 [en]: The jumper's.

Character 2 [en]: [gasp loudly] Wait—you already knew? You knew who he was?

Character 1 [en]: I've been investigating him for six months.

Character 2 [en]: Then you understand why I can't let this go. Everyone thinks he's dead, case closed, justice served. But a body that's never found, a witness nobody believes, and fifty million dollars that vanished the same night? Come on.

Character 1 [en]: You think he faked it.

Character 2 [en]: I think a man who can steal fifty million dollars can probably figure out how to survive a fall that three other people have survived before. Navy SEALs train for water entries from that height. It's possible if you know exactly what you're doing.

Character 1 [en]: If you're right, if he's alive...

Character 2 [en]: Then he's out there somewhere, probably sipping mai tais on a beach nobody's heard of, watching the news call him a coward who couldn't face justice. And I'm the only person who knows the truth—that I watched a man disappear, not die.
