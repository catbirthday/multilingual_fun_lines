============================================================

1. Okay okay, let me, um, pull that up. Need your, uh, employee ID first.
2. Got it. E-4739. Um, looking here... expense report EXP-2024-1182, submitted, uh, last Tuesday. Give me just... okay okay, seeing the denial code.
3. Right right, so, um, the code here is, uh, NC-447 which is... hmm... "non-covered athletic expense." System's showing, um, snacks aren't in the approved category under, uh, policy ATH-9921-B.
4. Um, yeah, I'm, uh, really sorry about this. Let me just... diving deeper here... transaction TXN-88142-QV shows $47.82 at, um, Price Mart?
5. I'm, uh, I'm checking the guidelines and, um, it's it's pretty strict on this. Really sorry. The, uh, the policy revision from January made it, um, more restrictive.
6. Oh. Oh that's, um, different then. Let me, uh, add a note here. If you have, um, authorization from—wait, Martinez, that's that's department head level, right?
7. No no, you're, uh, you're absolutely right. I'm um, really sorry about this. Let me, uh, flag this for review with code SUP-AUTH-01. That that changes things.
8. Totally totally get it. Um, so I'm, uh, escalating to claims review with reference REF-6639-MZ. They'll, um, they'll need Coach Martinez to, uh, confirm the authorization but then it should should process.
9. Of course, um, happy to help. The the review takes, uh, usually 3-5 days and you'll get, um, an email to case number CSE-10847-RT when it's, uh, when it's resolved.
10. Yeah so, um, for future, use, uh, category code CAT-18 "team morale" instead of CAT-22 "equipment." That that should, um, prevent this. Added a note to your profile, EMP-4739-NOTE.
11. I hear you—I hear you completely, and um, I'm pulling up your account right now with reference number REF-9942-TK, so let's—let's start fresh here and I promise I'm listening to every word you're telling me.
12. Absolutely, yes, I've got case number CSE-4481-MN right here on my screen and I can see the previous interactions you've had, which, um, honestly don't look like they addressed your core issue at all.
13. So the—no wait, let me just—okay okay, the thing is, your original request from ticket TKT-7703-JP got misrouted to billing when it's clearly—it's clearly a technical issue, and that's why you've been getting nowhere.
14. Right right, exactly, and um, so what happened is—uh, when you mentioned the, the router error code ERR-5501, that should've immediately flagged for technical support, not billing, so let's get this sorted properly.
15. Well, I mean, that's—that's literally my job, but um, I appreciate that, and look, I'm gonna get this fixed today with priority escalation PRI-8827-QX, no more runaround.
16. I can—no actually, let me—I can and I will, because um, looking at your account history under customer ID CUS-9903-LL, you've been dealing with this for three weeks, which is, uh, completely unacceptable.
17. Oh that's—that's terrible, and um, completely understand why you're frustrated, so here's what I'm doing right now—I'm bypassing the normal queue and creating direct dispatch order DSP-6672-RW for a tech to come tomorrow morning.
18. Tomorrow tomorrow—I mean, literally tomorrow, um, between 8 and 10 AM, and I'm putting my direct extension EXT-4429 in your file so if anything goes wrong, you call me directly.
19. Hey, it's—it's what should've happened from the start, and um, I'm also adding service credit SVC-3381-PP to your account for the inconvenience, which should show up within 24 hours.
20. That's really—I mean, that's kind of you to say, and um, just remember you've got confirmation number CNF-7745-XM for everything we discussed, and uh, genuinely, call me if you need anything else, okay okay?
21. Oh, um, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that... let me just, uh, pull up your account here if you could... actually, what's your account number or email, if that's...
22. Okay so, um, I'm seeing here account ACC-34892-JM and, uh, the BrightSmile monthly subscription... oh, hmm, it looks like it's been active since, um, let me see here...
23. Oh gosh, I completely understand that feeling... you know, I once had a gym membership going for eight months that I never... anyway, let me get this sorted for you right away, reference number REF-2024-88291 for this cancellation...
24. Right? Um, it happens to literally everyone, and honestly, uh, between you and me? The system should really, um, send better reminders... let me just, er, process this cancellation here...
25. Oh no no, um, please don't be hard on yourself... I'm looking at your history here, order ORD-7745-DK, and, uh, actually I think I can... hmm, would you like me to see about a partial refund since you haven't, um, placed any product orders in the last four months?
26. So here's what I'm going to do—and this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I'm submitting a refund request RFQ-55812-X for the last three months, because honestly our system should have flagged this inactive account...
27. Of course, of course... um, and actually, let me also, uh, add a note here to your file, note ID NTE-99847-JM, so if you ever, um, need anything in the future, any agent will see that you're... well, that we should've done better...
28. Oh my goodness, see? That's exactly why I'm making sure you get this refund... okay so confirmation code CNF-44509-BB for the cancellation, and you should see that refund in three to five business days...
29. Never, never... we've all been there, trust me... is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other subscriptions you want me to check on while we're here?
30. You're so welcome... and hey, your case number CSE-88462-JM is in your email now, and honestly? Six months is nothing compared to some of the stories I could tell you... you take care, okay?
31. Oh no, I'm I'm so sorry that happened to you. Um, that must have been really frustrating, especially if you were, uh, in the middle of checking out. Let me pull up your account here with, hmm, transaction ID TXN-9284-XK and we'll figure this out together, okay?
32. Absolutely, um, I mean, of course! So I'm looking at, uh, your payment attempt from about, er, three minutes ago, reference number REF-8372-YM41, and, um, I can see exactly what happened here...
33. Oh, I I totally understand that feeling. The system shows your card ending in 4782 was flagged because, and this is so annoying when it happens, your bank thought it was suspicious since you haven't ordered from us in six months.
34. I know, um, I really do. It's it's like the banks, uh, they're trying to protect you but then they, hmm, they overdo it? Your authorization code AUT-1629-BK22 just needs, um, a quick verification and we can retry it right away.
35. No no no, not at all! I can can actually handle this from my end. The declined transaction TXN-9284-XK is still pending, so if you're ready, I can resubmit it with override code OVR-7731-QP right now.
36. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and, uh, this is because you've been so patient—I'm adding, er, free expedited shipping to your order ORD-5524-TL90, so you'll get it in, hmm, two days instead of five.
37. It's it's the least I can do. Um, honestly, the payment system has been, uh, a little overzealous lately and, hmm, I've been adding shipping upgrades all week. Let me just, um, process this with confirmation PRC-8821-VX33...
38. Perfect! So, um, everything went through smoothly this time. Your new receipt number is RCP-4419-MN82, and, uh, you should get an email in about, hmm, thirty seconds confirming everything.
39. I I really do know what you mean. Before I worked here, I had this nightmare experience with my bank where—anyway, is there anything else I can help you with today? Your order ORD-5524-TL90 is all set, but I'm here if you need anything.
40. Um, yes! Absolutely free, and, uh, if you check your email, tracking number TRK-6637-RS29 will be, hmm, active by tonight. Thank you so much for your patience with the whole payment thing, and er, honestly, for being so nice about it.
41. Oh yeah, totally get that. Um, I actually had the same thing happen with my phone bill last month. Let me pull up your account... got it, account number ACC-4492-NJ. So what specific charges are confusing?
42. Right, um, so looking at your invoice INV-88204-K here, I can see, uh, there's definitely a few line items. Um, honestly, some of these fees are, well, they're not super clear even to me sometimes. Let me break each one down.
43. Ha, um, I mean, I know them now but, uh, when I first started? Complete mystery. Okay so, um, your base service is forty-nine ninety-nine, then there's, uh, the regulatory recovery fee of three dollars twelve cents.
44. Exactly, yeah. But then there's more. The, um, network access fee of seven fifty, and then, uh, your equipment lease for the router, that's twelve dollars. All showing on statement STM-7739-PQ.
45. So, um, yeah, that's the modem we sent. Uh, lot of people forget about that one. Then there's, um, the broadcast TV surcharge of nineteen ninety-five, and, uh, the regional sports fee of eight fifty.
46. I know, right? Um, it's honestly kind of ridiculous but, uh, everyone gets charged that in your ZIP code. Even my grandma who only watches cooking shows. Reference number REF-2210-BX shows it's mandatory for your area.
47. Pretty much. Oh wait, that's weird. There's also a, um, convenience fee of four ninety-nine on transaction TXN-889204431 that, uh, shouldn't be there if you're on autopay.
48. Hmm, let me check... uh, okay so this is interesting. You're, um, enrolled in autopay but it's not, uh, it's not active? System code SYS-1147-D says pending verification.
49. Yeah so, um, once we fix that, you'll save the four ninety-nine monthly. Want me to, uh, activate it now? Just need to confirm the payment method on file PAY-6621-RT.
50. Exactly sixty bucks, yeah. Um, and honestly? I'm gonna credit back the last three months of those fees too. Credit confirmation CRD-445789 will show up in, uh, two to three days. My manager might not love it but, um, you shouldn't have been charged those.
51. Oh um, I'm so sorry about that, uh, let me just pull up your info here and we'll get this sorted right away, what's your account number?
52. Got it, um, account ACC-872-9463, and uh, I can see here that you've called, hmm, three times this week? That's, er, that's really frustrating, I'm gonna make sure we fix this permanently.
53. No no, um, absolutely not your fault, uh, the system has issues with ACC-872-9463 specifically because, er, the seven-two combo gets flagged as, hmm, potentially invalid, which is ridiculous.
54. Right right, um, so what I'm gonna do is, uh, add a note here under ticket TKT-9982-VX that says, er, bypass voice verification for this account, and hmm, I'm also setting up a direct dial code.
55. Absolutely, um, your new direct code is gonna be DRC-4421-K, so uh, next time you call, just press star-nine and enter that, totally skips the bot.
56. Good good, and um, I'm also seeing here in your history that, uh, you had an issue with order ORD-7739-PL last month that, er, also got stuck in the automated system?
57. Yeah I can imagine, um, so what I'm doing right now is, uh, linking both these cases under master ticket MST-8847-QZ2, and er, flagging your whole account for manual review priority.
58. I mean, um, I deal with this system every day and uh, between you and me? It drives me crazy too, er, especially when I see accounts like ACC-872-9463 just stuck in loops.
59. Of course, um, invoice INV-20241-RK8 right? I'm uh, emailing that now, and er, I'm also gonna send you my direct extension, it's 4421, just in case.
60. Perfect, um, and hey, I put a permanent note in your file that says, er, "escalate immediately if voice system fails," with reference REF-8829-TK, so uh, anyone who gets your call will see it right away.
61. Yes! I've been working as a pastry chef for, um, about eight years now, and you know, every single day still feels like this wonderful creative adventure in the kitchen.
62. Oh absolutely, but there's something magical about being in the kitchen at 4 AM when the whole world is quiet and you're creating these beautiful things that will brighten people's days.
63. That's true, honestly, baking is [formal] quite scientific, but once you understand the fundamentals, like, you can really start playing with flavors and textures to create something uniquely yours.
64. It definitely takes practice, but the joy on someone's face when they bite into a perfect croissant or a delicate macaron makes every challenge completely worthwhile.
65. My signature is this lavender honey tart with a lemon curd center that took me months to perfect, and now it's become the most requested item at our bakery.
66. You should come by the shop sometime! I'd love to have you try it, and I promise even if you're not usually into sweets, this one might change your mind.
67. That would be wonderful! So, I always believe that, I mean, food has this incredible power to bring comfort and joy, kind of like edible happiness, if that makes sense.
68. I completely understand that, err, life gets busy, but the thing is, treating yourself to something special occasionally, anyway, can really lift your spirits on a tough day.
69. That's perfectly fine! Ah, not everyone has a sweet tooth, you know, but I also make savory pastries like these amazing gruyère and caramelized onion palmiers that, well, might be more your style.
70. See? There's always something for everyone in the world of pastry, and I love helping people discover flavors they never knew they'd enjoy!
71. Yes! After twelve years behind other people's [acelerando] bars, I finally secured the investors and found the perfect location downtown near the arts district.
72. It's been a long journey, honestly, from washing glasses at dive bars to, er, studying mixology in Tokyo, but every step taught me something essential about this craft.
73. Between my savings and three angel investors, we raised about four hundred thousand, which covers renovation, licensing, initial inventory, and six months of operating expenses.
74. I know it sounds [very slowly] like a lot, but, hmm, the profit margins in this industry are actually quite good if you, well, manage inventory properly and create the right atmosphere.
75. Pre-Prohibition era cocktails with, um, modern techniques, featuring house-made bitters and, sort of, locally sourced ingredients, plus we'll have live jazz Thursday through Saturday nights.
76. Sophisticated but approachable is exactly what we're aiming for, with cocktails ranging from twelve to eighteen dollars and a strong emphasis on educating customers about cocktail history.
77. Of course I'm nervous, but fear [murmurando] of failure can't stop you from pursuing your dreams, and I've planned for every contingency I can think of.
78. We've already pre-sold two hundred tickets [confiante] for our soft opening, and my regular customers from my current bar have been spreading the word for months.
79. It includes five craft cocktails, [espirro] appetizers, and live entertainment, so it's really more of an exclusive tasting event than just a regular opening.
80. Thank you, that means everything. This dream started [hesitante] fifteen years ago when I was just a broke college student who loved making drinks, and now it's actually happening.
81. Oh yes! They're— well, they're fascinating, sort of a crowdsourced way to predict outcomes where people actually put money behind their beliefs about future events.
82. I've been, er, trading on them for— [yawn] sorry, for about six months now, honestly, and they're basically more accurate than polls or expert predictions most of the time.
83. Absolutely, hmm, I've made around three thousand dollars just by, really, betting on things I understand well, anyway, like tech product launches and election outcomes.
84. Right so, you buy shares in an outcome, you know, like "Will inflation drop below 3% by December?" and the thing is, if you're right, each share pays out a dollar.
85. Exactly! The market prices reflect collective wisdom, and studies show they outperform traditional forecasting methods by about twenty to thirty percent on average.
86. Right right.
87. Oh sure, because [sarcástico] nothing could possibly go wrong when we gamble on whether democracies will collapse or pandemics will spread.
88. Sorry, umm, I do think they're valuable, I mean, but we need to honestly consider the ethical implications of betting on human suffering or political instability.
89. Information is power, but these markets can create perverse incentives where people might actually benefit financially from disasters or manipulate events they're betting on.
90. Maybe you're right, uh, and regulation could help, kind of, but the thing is we're essentially turning reality into a casino, which fundamentally changes how we relate to future events.
91. Not exactly, it's more about understanding supply and demand patterns, weather forecasts, geopolitical events, and using that data to make informed decisions about futures contracts.
92. Look, when I'm trading wheat futures, I'm analyzing crop yields from five different continents, monitoring drought conditions, and tracking shipping lane disruptions—that's systematic risk assessment, not rolling dice.
93. Actually I'm up $47,000 this quarter, mainly from copper positions I took before the Chilean mine strikes, which anyone paying attention could have predicted.
94. The indicators were there if you, um, knew where to look—labor negotiations had been stalling for months, you know, and inventory levels were already tight, basically setting up a perfect storm.
95. Okay yes, I lost $15,000 on crude, but that was a hedge against my natural gas positions which made $38,000, so net positive by a wide margin.
96. I'm managing [monótono] $2.3 million in positions across fourteen different commodities, each with their own seasonal patterns, storage costs, and delivery specifications that require constant monitoring.
97. I've visited farms in Iowa and [murmurando] Brazil, watched harvest operations, talked to farmers about yield expectations, because understanding the physical commodity makes me a better trader.
98. Listen, I [over confidently] turned $50,000 into $1.8 million over six years, so, while you're making jokes, err, I'm making returns that honestly beat the S&P by 300%.
99. Already happening, but algorithms can't interview dock workers about strike rumors or notice when a major processor quietly starts stockpiling, which is where human traders still have an edge.
100. When drought hits Australia and [ansioso] wheat prices spike 40%, real bakeries pay real money for flour, affecting real people's food costs—I'm trading necessity, not lottery tickets.
101. Oh interesting, when did this start happening? Are you seeing any specific error messages in the logs, or is it just random shutdowns without warning?
102. Which base image are you using exactly? And have you checked if there were any breaking changes in that update that might conflict with your application dependencies?
103. Wait, you jumped straight to 3.18? That's, you know, a pretty significant version bump. Are you, hmm, monitoring memory usage when these crashes happen, like, at all?
104. Okay, [aliviado] no judgment here! But can you at least run docker stats while it's running to see if you're hitting resource limits?
105. Have you, uhh, set any resource constraints in your docker-compose file? Sometimes, you know, containers crash when they hit memory limits, the thing is, Docker doesn't always make that obvious.
106. Oh [riso] wow, okay so, that explains a lot! How many containers are you, actually, running, and are they, well, networked together somehow?
107. And you're managing [pausa longa] all of this manually? How do you, err, handle restarts when things crash, or like, ensure they come up in the right order?
108. A bash script for orchestrating six containers? What happens when dependencies fail to start, or do you have any health checks built in?
109. But earlier you [voz trémula] said they're crashing every few hours? Have you considered that maybe the containers are interfering with each other's resources on the host?
110. So you went from four to [pausa] six containers without adjusting anything? Let me guess, sort of, no volume management either, and probably, well, logs are filling up your disk space?
111. Hey, um, I just thought we could, [alegre] you know, bounce some ideas around! I've been reading about how color temperature affects mood, and honestly, it's fascinating stuff.
112. Okay, I get that you're protective of your vision, totally understandable. But didn't you mention last week that the client wasn't happy with the first mockup?
113. Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes here, seriously. Just thought maybe a fresh perspective could help since you seemed stressed about the deadline.
114. Right, but you've got what, three days left? And you still haven't figured out the accent lighting for the main gallery space, have you?
115. Sarah mentioned it when I ran into her at the supply store yesterday. She said you were having trouble with the track lighting angles creating weird shadows.
116. Your approach of, hmm, using only warm whites? I guess, that could work, but, you know, have you considered how that'll wash out the artwork, basically?
117. I'm not lecturing, just asking questions! You're using 2700K bulbs for contemporary art pieces that need crisp whites, aren't you?
118. Sure, but, well, warm doesn't have to mean, sort of, yellow, right? You could, anyway, mix in some 3500K spots for the actual artwork.
119. Five years of residential work though, right? Gallery lighting is a completely different beast with different requirements for color accuracy and drama.
120. Not questioning, just pointing out that this is your first gallery installation. Maybe being open to suggestions isn't the worst idea when the client's already expressed concerns?
121. [atónito] Um, what?
122. Fifteen years I've taught those kids here, watched them, [quebrando], overcome their fears and learn to trust the water when they couldn't trust anything else. [pausa]
123. [amargo] Um, maintenance costs—do you know what Tommy's mother said when he, well, when he finally swam his first lap without, [choking up], holding the wall after two years of, I mean, trying every single Tuesday and Thursday without, [quieter], ever giving up? [laughs bitterly]
124. [controlled] The numbers don't account for Sarah who stopped, [tight], self-harming after finding peace in these lanes.
125. [baixo] Well, um, how do you restructure hope exactly, I mean, how do you, [vazio], put that in a spreadsheet? [pausa longa]
126. [surpreendido] Um, had?
127. Jesus, I'm sorry, I didn't—look, um, these kids, they trust me and, [desesperado], their parents have nowhere else that's affordable, I mean, nowhere that understands their, [strained], specific needs the way we've learned to, well, to accommodate them here.
128. [determinado] So, well, what if we found alternative funding, I mean, corporate sponsors or, um, community fundraising that could offset the, [urgente], losses? [esperançoso]
129. [determinado] Um, then I'll need your help understanding exactly what numbers would, well, would make them reconsider.
130. Ten days to save fifteen years of work and, [determinado], dozens of kids who finally found somewhere they belong—I'll make it, [fierce], happen somehow. [nods slowly]
131. [frio] And you're still here, [enojado], fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning like some pathetic lapdog after all these years.
132. [zombeteiro] Oh please, [amargo], that was twenty years ago and you're still whining about high school. [laughs cruelly]
133. [heated] Money doesn't make me, [aggressive], better than you—your pathetic choices and, [harsh], complete lack of ambition did that all, [spitting], by themselves. [scoffs]
134. [furioso] You dare talk about my, [seething], personal life when you're literally washing my mother's underwear for minimum wage?
135. [chocado] What?
136. [desesperado] She wouldn't—I mean, that's impossible because I'm her, [cracking], only child and you're just hired help, um, you're nobody to her, well, you have to be lying.
137. [quebrando] This is, um, insane—I've been sending her money every month, well, paying for this house and, [frantic], everything she needs. [voice cracks]
138. [vulnerável] I didn't know she was, um, that sick because she never told me and, well, I thought the money meant I was, [lost], taking care of her.
139. [derrotado] Can I at least see her, [suplicante], before you throw me out of what used to be, [broken], my childhood home?
140. I guess we both ended up, well, exactly where we, [vazio], deserved to be, didn't we—me with, um, all the money and none of the, [empty], love. [sighs heavily]
141. [hesitante] That's incredibly kind but I don't have the money to, [envergonhado], pay for a chef's meal and I've learned not to take, [cansado], what I can't repay somehow.
142. [atónito] Wait, your voice is so, um, familiar and the way you, [shaking], hold that knife with your left hand even though you're, well, [realizing], right-handed, I mean, oh God, is it really you?
143. [broken] I never thought, um, I'd see you again after what I, [culpado], did to you and the restaurant we, well, built together. [exhales]
144. [desesperado] Look, I know what you must think and, um, there's no excuse for taking the money but I was, [vazio], drowning in debts you didn't even know about and, well, [envergonhado], the gambling had gotten so bad.
145. You're not calling the police or, [confuso], screaming at me or even asking where the, [lost], hundred thousand dollars went?
146. [trémulo] I've been walking from town to town for, um, three years now, never staying anywhere long enough for the guilt to, [haunted], catch up but it always does anyway, and, well, [quebrando], seeing you here being kind to me is, um, worse than any punishment. [voice cracks]
147. [anguished] The money is gone, every penny lost to, [amargo], bookies and bad bets before I even left town that, [arrependido], night in the rain.
148. [cru] I dream about that kitchen we had with the, um, copper pots and the old gas range that only you could, [nostálgico], make work properly and I wake up on park benches, well, [empty], remembering I destroyed it all because I couldn't, um, stop myself from betting on just one more game. [cries softly]
149. [grato] Why are you being so, um, kind to me when I stole your dream and, well, [wondering], ran like a coward into the night?
150. [resignado] Maybe that's why you were always the real chef and I was just, well, someone who knew about money until I didn't even know that anymore. [pausa longa]
151. Não incomoda nada. Deixa-me abrir a tua conta. Podes dar-me o teu email?
152. Perfeito. Jake Miller. Estou a ver a tua conta aqui, ACC-45782-JM. Então estás a perguntar sobre o nosso sistema automático de ajuste de preços. Isso é algo em que te posso definitivamente ajudar.
153. Não não. Isto confunde toda a gente. A sério. Então basicamente, quando fazes a encomenda ORD-9923-KL44 hoje, o nosso sistema acompanha esse artigo durante 7 dias. Se o preço desce. Pronto. Creditamos-te a diferença.
154. Bem, hum, sinceramente devia ser padrão em todo o lado, mas é, olha, estou a ver que tiveste a encomenda ORD-8847-MP22 na semana passada, e hmm, sim, o preço desceu 12 euros por isso esse crédito, hum, já deve ter entrado.
155. Aqui mesmo. Transação TXN-338492710. Processada terça-feira. Mas olha—o sistema falhou uma. A tua encomenda ORD-8691-LP33 do dia 15. Esse artigo desceu 18 euros.
156. Não. Vamos resolver isto. Tipo, estou a processar o ajuste manual ADJ-77923-X agora mesmo, por isso hum, 18 euros a caminho, provavelmente até amanhã.
157. É pois, mas tipo, estás a ser fixe com isto por isso, hmm, deixa-me verificar outra coisa... Ok. Ok. Então também estou a ver mais três encomendas elegíveis para revisão.
158. Então hum, normalmente é automático dentro dessa janela de 7 dias, mas é, estas são do mês passado, encomendas ORD-7426-NM91, ORD-7502-PP18, e é, ORD-7599-RK20, por isso tecnicamente fora da janela mas vou, hmm, processá-las na mesma.
159. Só estou a fazer o meu trabalho. Mas como deve ser. Olha, o total que vais receber é 47,50. Número de referência REF-20943-CLM. Tira print disso.
160. Sinceramente? Sim. Hum, há um questionário depois desta chamada, e é, o meu ID de funcionária é EMP-4782-SS se quiseres mencionar-me especificamente, mas tipo, sem pressão, só fico, sabes, contente por termos resolvido isto.
161. Está bem. Deixa-me. Ver isso. Qual é o email da conta?
162. Pronto então, hum, estou a ver a conta JNM-448392-Q aqui e, eh, isto é estranho na verdade, diz que houve, hmm, 5 tentativas falhadas de login? Há cerca de hum, há cerca de uma hora?
163. Pois então, hum, o sistema bloqueia automaticamente depois de, eh, depois de 3 tentativas. But you said five so... hmm. Estavas talvez, hum, a tentar passwords diferentes ou...?
164. Certo certo. Então. A questão é. O nosso sistema mostra. A última mudança de password foi... ontem às 15:47.
165. Ah está bem então, hum, mudaste mesmo então? Because I can see here, eh, o código de confirmação SEC-990281-K foi enviado para o teu email e, hmm, foi verificado por isso...
166. Não não é, hum, é totalmente normal. Acontece sempre na verdade. Então, eh, talvez te lembres para o que mudaste? Ou tipo, hum, escreveste em algum lado...?
167. Perfeito. Não tenhas pressa. While you're looking. Posso enviar um link de reset para o teu email de recuperação?
168. Ei não te preocupes, hum, a sério tipo tive 3 pessoas hoje com, eh, com a mesma coisa. So you're good to, hum, tentar fazer login agora ou queres aquele link de reset por via das dúvidas?
169. Percebo totalmente. Aquele pânico quando não consegues entrar. Happens to me with my bank like. Todos os meses.
170. Ah por favor, hum, isto foi na verdade meio refrescante? Like usually it's, eh, problemas técnicos reais que não consigo resolver então, hmm, vitória fácil para mim hoje. Mais alguma coisa que precises enquanto tenho a tua conta REC-20241209-T aberta?
171. Oh, hum, isso é mesmo bom de ouvir. Deixa-me, ah, abrir aqui a tua conta para poder documentar isto como deve ser. Acho que só preciso do teu número de telefone para, hum, para encontrar a interação de há bocado?
172. Perfeito, já está. Então consigo ver aqui, hum, parece que falaste com a Agente Martinez sobre, ah, deixa-me ver... encomenda número ORD-9847-TK23, e isso foi resolvido há umas duas horas?
173. Mmm-hmm, estou só, hum, a tirar notas aqui. A documentar tudo como deve ser no ticket TKT-884921-M para a supervisora dela ver este feedback.
174. Acho que é, hum, mesmo importante para nós ouvir isto. Aliás, ah, consigo ver que ela foi em frente e aplicou um crédito de cortesia também, número de referência REF-7823-CC, o que deve ter ajudado com a situação?
175. Pois, pois. Então estou, hum, a adicionar tudo isto ao ficheiro de desempenho dela sob a recomendação COM-2847-PM, e, ah, acho que a chefe dela vai definitivamente querer reconhecer este tipo de serviço.
176. Com certeza, vou garantir isso. Hum, aliás, sabes que mais? Vou, ah, sinalizar isto no nosso sistema sob o número de caso CSE-9921-QUAL como exemplo de excelente recuperação de serviço.
177. Então, hum, nós temos mesmo um programa de reconhecimento. Não posso bem, ah, falar de especificidades mas acho que recomendações como esta definitivamente, hum, contam para as avaliações de desempenho e tal.
178. Não, eu, ah, percebo completamente. A sério. Deixa-me só... ok, encaminhei isto para a nossa equipa de qualidade sob QUA-7734-FB e eles provavelmente, hum, até podem usar isto para formação se estiveres de acordo?
179. Pois, faz sentido. Então tenho tudo documentado aqui, número de referência para este elogio é CMP-8829-MTZ, e, hum, há mais alguma coisa sobre a interação que querias que eu anotasse?
180. Bem, hum, obrigada por teres dedicado tempo a ligar de volta sobre isto. Acho que faz mesmo, ah, diferença quando os clientes partilham feedback positivo, e vou garantir absolutamente que a Agente Martinez e a supervisora dela veem isto hoje sob sinalização prioritária PRI-4421-A.
181. Certo! Ok então deixa-me abrir aqui a tua conta, podes dar-me o teu ID de comerciante ou o número de série do dispositivo que deve estar atrás?
182. Sim sim, percebo perfeitamente, hum, então se virares o dispositivo deve ter um autocolante com SN- e depois uns números, ou posso procurar-te pelo nome da empresa se for mais rápido?
183. Perfeito! Encontrei-te, conta MER-44892-TK, e consigo ver que o teu terminal Square SN-789456123 ficou offline há, oh! Doze minutos, foi quando parou?
184. Boa jogada, é exatamente o que eu tentaria primeiro! Então, hum, a ver aqui os teus diagnósticos, o registo de transação TXN-445678901 mostra um timeout de rede, deixa-me só fazer aqui um reset remoto rápido.
185. Ok ok então o reset demora cerca de noventa segundos mas—oh espera! Estou a ver uma coisa aqui, a tua última transação bem-sucedida RCP-88234-P foi interrompida, o ecrã congelou durante um pagamento?
186. Ahá! É é esse o problema mesmo, então quando a transação TXN-445678902 ficou presa bloqueou o sistema todo, mas boa notícia, posso forçar a limpeza daqui agora mesmo!
187. Então, hum, essa transação nunca foi concluída por isso o cartão dele não foi debitado, o número de referência VOID-22847-X confirma isso, e estou a enviar o comando de desbloqueio agora, deve demorar uns quinze segundos.
188. Eu sei eu sei, este timing é horrível, hum, mas olha—pronto! Código de estado 200-OK, o teu terminal deve estar a reiniciar agora com luz verde, estás a ver isso?
189. Sim! Adoro quando funciona assim tão rápido! O teu dispositivo está online outra vez, o ID de conexão NET-33492-LIVE mostra conectividade total, e, é, só para saberes, estou a creditar cinquenta euros na tua conta pelo incómodo, nota de crédito CRD-99234-F.
190. De nada! E hum, marquei a tua conta com código de prioridade PRI-GOLD-8823 por isso se isto voltar a acontecer saltas a fila, mas sinceramente não deve, esse bloqueio de transação é super raro.
191. Oh interessante! Pronto pronto, deixa-me abrir aqui a tua conta com o número ACC-9947-TK23, and we'll figure out exactly what's going on together, o que é que te disseram?
192. Ah sim, reembolso instantâneo, percebi, e depois, hm, o que é que o outro agente te disse porque isso é... hmm, that's definitely one option we have.
193. Ok então, aqui entre nós, both agents were technically right, que eu sei que parece uma loucura mas a tua encomenda RMA-5582-QV tem duas opções de reembolso e parece que nenhum dos agentes, hm, explicou isso como deve ser.
194. Não não não, tu estás a perceber perfeitamente! So here's the deal, se escolheres crédito da loja com o código CRD-8847-ML9, isso é instantâneo na tua conta, mas se quiseres de volta no teu método de pagamento original, that's the 7 to 10 days.
195. Olha, hm, nem te preocupes porque sinceramente? Our system should prompt agents to explain both options, e claramente alguém falhou aqui, não foste tu.
196. That's the fun part! A ver o teu caso número CSE-7729-BN aqui, ninguém selecionou nenhuma das opções ainda, so you get to choose right now, e pessoalmente? Eu escolheria o crédito instantâneo se compras aqui regularmente.
197. Perfeito! Então vou, eh, processar isso agora mesmo como crédito da loja, and here's what's cool, o teu código de crédito STC-9903-FF44 vai literalmente estar no teu email tipo, como é que se diz... instantaneamente, assim que desligarmos.
198. Mesmo instantâneo, prometo, e aqui entre nós? I'm also adding an extra 15% bonus ao montante do crédito BNS-4421-XL por causa da confusão, que tecnicamente não devia fazer mas...
199. Já está feito! So your original refund of $67.50 agora está a aparecer como $77.63 em crédito na transação TXN-8856-QQW2, deve chegar à tua caixa de entrada em cerca de 30 segundos.
200. Ei, isso é totalmente justo, hm, getting different info is super annoying, mas agora está tudo resolvido com o número de confirmação CNF-2234-RTP9 e sinceramente? Enjoy that extra credit, mereceste pela tua paciência connosco.
201. Ah, compreendo perfeitamente porque é que isso seria frustrante, sinceramente também me sinto assim quando vejo essas promoções para clientes novos por todo o lado, deixa-me só abrir aqui a tua conta, podes dar-me o número de conta ou o número de telefone associado?
202. Perfeito, então estou a ver aqui a conta ACC-4892-N e, hum, tens toda a razão, és nossa cliente desde, é, 2018 que é mesmo... quer dizer, é uma fidelidade incrível e, hum, sinceramente o sistema devia reconhecer isso melhor do que reconhece...
203. Então o que posso fazer é o seguinte, e hum, acho que vais mesmo gostar disto porque, é, embora não possa aplicar retroativamente essa promoção de cliente novo, estou a ver que há um código de recompensa de fidelidade LYL-2024-GOLD que, hmm, na verdade dá-te sessenta por cento de desconto nos próximos três meses em vez de apenas os cinquenta por uma vez...
204. Sim! E, hum, sinceramente entre nós, é tipo melhor porque, é, a coisa de cliente novo é só para o primeiro mês mas isto são, tipo, três meses completos com esse desconto, então a tua nova mensalidade seria, hum, deixa-me calcular... 23,99€ em vez de 59,99€.
205. Pois é! E também estou, hum, a ver que podemos adicionar, é, as funcionalidades premium sem custo extra, então isso é o número de referência REF-7734-PREMIUM, e hum, basicamente vais ficar com mais do que os clientes novos recebem, que parece mais justo, sabes?
206. Não não não, de todo, quer dizer és nossa cliente há seis anos, isso importa-nos, importa mesmo, e embora o nosso departamento de marketing faça estas coisas chamativas para clientes novos que eu sei que pode parecer mesmo injusto, nós temos estes programas de fidelidade que simplesmente... não são tão bem publicitados como deviam ser...
207. Então os sessenta por cento de desconto são para três meses com o código promocional SAVE60-VET que estou a aplicar agora mesmo, mas depois disso vais continuar a ter um desconto de fidelidade de vinte por cento para sempre enquanto mantiveres a conta, isso fica registado com o ID de benefício BEN-2024-8823-LP.
208. Tens toda a razão, e acho que... sinceramente perdemos bons clientes porque não sabem que estas opções existem, é algo que já mencionei antes aliás...
209. Totalmente compreensível, também ficaria frustrada, mas estou mesmo contente por termos conseguido dar a volta a isto, a tua nova tarifa começa com o próximo ciclo de faturação no dia quinze, número de confirmação CNF-9982-APPROVED, e vais receber um email com todos estes detalhes dentro de uma hora mais ou menos.
210. De nada! E sinceramente obrigada EU por ficares connosco todos estes anos, se precisares de mais alguma coisa, a tua referência de conta atualizada é ACC-4892-N-GOLD, basta mencionares isso e qualquer agente verá o teu estatuto VIP, tem um excelente resto de dia!
211. Oh um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick and um, sorry, it's been one of those days, uh, can I get your email or order number?
212. Perfect, okay I've got you here, Jennifer Kimura, and I'm seeing your recent purchase for the ultrasound continuing education modules, transaction ID TXN-847291-QR, is that what you're calling about?
213. Oh boy, let me check this... yeah so I'm actually seeing two charges here, one for $299 with receipt RCP-55024-M and another identical one with RCP-55025-M just three minutes later, that's definitely not right.
214. No no, these are both completed transactions unfortunately, but um, here's what I can do—I'm already initiating a refund for the duplicate charge, reference number REF-990837-XK, should hit your account in 3-5 business days.
215. Absolutely! Um, so your access code EDU-77812-VPN is, uh, totally fine, um, the duplicate was just a payment glitch on our end, happens sometimes when the, er, system hiccups.
216. Oh totally sure, um, I'm actually looking at your learning portal right now and, uh, everything's active, all twelve modules ready to go, and um, honestly between you and me? This payment system drives me crazy too.
217. Yeah so, um, technically it's 3-5 business days but, uh, usually it's faster, like most people see it in, um, two days? I put a priority flag on your refund ticket TKT-440926-B just to, er, help it along.
218. Right right, no problem at all, and um, hey, if you don't see it by like, uh, Thursday? Just call back with that refund reference number I gave you, um, REF-990837-XK, and whoever you get can, er, escalate it.
219. Oh good, um, yeah I try to just, uh, fix these things fast because honestly our payment processor has been, um, super glitchy lately and uh, you're like the third duplicate charge today.
220. I know, I know, we're supposedly getting a whole new system next month, order tracking update scheduled for March with project code UPG-2024-03, but honestly I'll believe it when I see it, anyway you're all set, anything else I can help with today?
221. Um, hello there! Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can I get your, um, account number or maybe the phone number associated with it?
222. Got it, um, let me just... okay so I'm seeing account BIZ-4472-SC here, and uh, it looks like you're on our, um, monthly automatic billing cycle, is that right?
223. I see, I see. So, um, what kind of changes are you, uh, thinking about? I mean, we have several options that might, um, work better for your situation.
224. Right, that's, uh, that's actually pretty common with service businesses. Let me check what we can do here with your current plan under reference code REF-9981-MZ.
225. No no, it's going to be okay, really. Um, so what I can do is, uh, set up what we call a flexible billing option under plan FLX-2234-A, which basically lets you, um, adjust payment dates as needed.
226. Absolutely, yes. I think what would work best is, um, we put you on our variable schedule system VSS-7761-B, and then you can, uh, basically choose your billing date each month.
227. That's totally understandable. So, um, the system will actually send you, uh, reminder emails five days before, and if you don't respond it just, um, defaults to your original date.
228. Not at all, not at all. Let me just, um, make these changes now under modification code MOD-5547-K, and uh, you'll get a confirmation email within, I'd say, probably ten minutes or so.
229. So, uh, it'll take effect starting with your next billing cycle, which looks like, um, let me see here... that's gonna be the fifteenth. Reference number for this change is CHG-8823-VP.
230. Exactly right. Um, you can email, call, or actually use the app too. Your case number today is CSE-4419-TL if you need to, uh, reference this conversation later.
231. Okay okay, so, um, I can definitely help with that, let me just—let me just pull up your account here and, uh, basically what we'll need is your order number or, um, the email address you used?
232. Oh oh, right right, so so you need this for, um, for reimbursement, and—and I totally get that, like deadlines are, uh, they're they're really stressful, so let me see what information you have and we'll get this sorted quickly, do you have an order number?
233. No worries, um, take your time, or or if you have the, uh, the approximate date or even just, like, what the purchase was for, I can—I can search for it that way?
234. Perfect perfect, so so I'm seeing, um, let me just—okay so there's an order here, ORD-4521-GPS, placed on October fifteenth for, uh, for a Garmin unit, total was $487.92, is—is that the one?
235. So unfortunately—and and I really wish I had, um, better news here—the standard documentation usually takes, uh, takes like 24 to 48 hours to process through our system, which which I know doesn't help with your deadline...
236. But but wait, so, um, between you and me? I'm gonna—I'm gonna try something here, there's this, uh, this expedited receipt function we have for, like, corporate accounts, and technically technically park services might qualify?
237. Okay okay, so so I've just, um, I've tagged your request as priority code PRI-889X and, uh, basically what I'm doing is—is routing it through our, like, our government services channel?
238. So so with this—with this priority routing, you should, um, you should have the full documentation with receipt number RCP-4521-DOC in your email within, uh, within the next two hours, maybe maybe even sooner?
239. I—I totally understand your concern, and and honestly, um, I'm showing here that 95% of these priority requests process in under, uh, under an hour, so so you should be fine, but but just to be safe, I'm also adding my direct extension, it's 5847?
240. No no, it's—it's my pleasure, and and honestly, like, park rangers do such important work, so, um, I've confirmed everything's submitted with tracking ID TRK-90021-RUSH, and uh, you should be all set for your deadline tomorrow!
241. Está bem, hum, deixe-me só... hmm, abrir aqui a sua conta. Qual é o, ah, número de telefone associado à conta para eu, hum, entrar no sistema e ver o que se passa?
242. Perfeito, perfeito.
243. Não não não, vamos resolver isto com certeza. Hum, então estou a ver a conta ACT-7829-WK e, ah, deixe-me ver aqui... está bem, então há uma cobrança de 15 de outubro para, hmm, pacote de serviços premium PRE-4419X, é a isso que se refere?
244. Pois pois.
245. Está bem então, hum, estou a ver aqui um padrão na verdade. Deixe-me só, ah, ver melhor o histórico de transações TXN-88291-Q e, hmm, e se... oh! Ah espere, já percebi o que aconteceu! Houve uma, hum, ativação automática do código de promoção PRM-6672 que, ah, não devia ter sido acionada no seu tipo de conta.
246. Não não, hum, ouça, isto foi completamente erro nosso e, ah, já estou a processar o reembolso. Número de referência REF-3847-MNK para o reembolso total mais, hmm, deixe-me ver o que mais posso... pronto, também vou adicionar um crédito de cortesia de, hum, mais quarenta euros pelo incómodo.
247. Com certeza.
248. Então, hum, o que estou a fazer agora é, ah, colocar um código de bloqueio BLK-9901-AA na sua conta que, hmm, basicamente impede quaisquer adesões ou upgrades automáticos sem, hum, confirmação verbal explícita gravada no ID de chamada CID-447829. Ninguém pode adicionar nada sem a senhora aprovar pessoalmente.
249. Hum, sim não, compreendo perfeitamente e, ah, vendo o histórico da sua conta... hmm, realmente tem sido fiel e, hum, aliás! Acabei de descobrir uma coisa! Qualifica-se para o nosso, ah, programa de ajuste de tarifa por fidelidade LRP-2024-B que reduz a sua tarifa base em, hum, quinze por cento daqui para a frente.
250. Perfeito! Então, hum, está tudo aplicado. A sua confirmação é CNF-88412-PPX para o reembolso que, ah, deve aparecer em 3 a 5 dias úteis, e o, hmm, o desconto de fidelidade começa imediatamente no seu próximo ciclo de faturação. E hum, como disse, nada pode ser adicionado sem a sua autorização explícita agora, por isso está, ah, totalmente protegida daqui para a frente.
251. Pois, já vi isto antes. Tens a tua conta aberta? Consigo provavelmente, hm, resolver isto em cerca de, eh, 2 segundos se tiveres o número da encomenda à mão.
252. Sem problema, sem problema. Acho que consigo, hm, provavelmente encontrar só com o teu, eh, email ou telefone. Whatever's easier.
253. Estou a perceber. Então, hm, deixa-me só, eh, ver as tuas encomendas recentes aqui e—okay okay, estou a ver 3 da semana passada. Era a que termina em, hm, acho que ORD-9482-XL?
254. Entendido, entendido. Então é a, hm, ORD-9477-PK, feita segunda às, eh, 15:47. Mostra entregue ontem às 14:15. Alpendre da frente.
255. Hm, então o que vou fazer, e já, eh, já fiz isto provavelmente umas 100 vezes por isso, hm, vamos resolver isto. First let me check if maybe the driver marked the wrong, eh, a entrega errada.
256. Então, eh, estou a ver o GPS ping da entrega e está, hmm, está a mostrar cerca de, hm, 12 metros do teu endereço. Might've gone to a neighbor?
257. Acho que estamos, hm, na pista certa. Então então então, deixa-me só, eh, verificar a foto que tiraram—sim, porta azul. A tua é azul?
258. Hey hey, não não não, percebo perfeitamente. Então, hm, deixa-me só—vou, eh, marcar isto como mal entregue agora mesmo, número de referência MSD-7739-QT22, e acho que conseguimos provavelmente enviar uma substituição, hm, hoje ainda.
259. Hm, bem, talvez não devesse prometer mas, eh, mas mas como é medicação, vou, hm, marcar como prioridade com código, eh, URGENT-MED-8847. Deve deve sair dentro de uma hora.
260. Estás estás perfeitamente bem, a sério. Hm, então só para, eh, confirmar tudo aqui—novo pacote sai hoje, o tracking vai ser, hm, TRK-9477-PK-R2, e talvez ponha uma nota para o motorista sobre a porta vermelha? Just to, you know, ter a certeza?
261. Ah! Deixa-me ver isso já—adoro resolver estes mistérios de autopay! Qual é o teu número de conta? Should be something like ACC followed by some digits.
262. ACC-4521-B, perfeito! Está bem, estou a ver a tentativa de pagamento do dia 15... OH! Acho que encontrei o culpado! O teu cartão que termina em 3847?
263. Não não não, tu fizeste tudo bem! The bank declined it with code ERR-2745-INSUFF. Basicamente, tentou processar às 3:47 da manhã e provavelmente não havia saldo disponível naquele momento exato.
264. Oh uau, está bem, isso é definitivamente importante. Deixa-me ver o que posso—actually, hold on, I think I can manually retry this right now with override code OVR-9923-X.
265. Já estou a tratar disso! O sistema está a lutar comigo aqui mas—YES! Consegui! Transaction TXN-8847-ZK is processing now. Deve ficar pronto em dois minutos, talvez?
266. Normalmente, sim, but medical suppliers get special handling protocols under policy MED-7736-A. Basicamente posso forçar a transação desde que os fundos estejam lá agora.
267. Deixa-me só... a verificar... SIM! Pagamento confirmado! Reference number REF-3928-KL for your records. Passou agora mesmo, 247.50€.
268. Compreendo perfeitamente. Actually, I think we should probably set up a backup payment method under your profile ID PRF-4521-B-SEC, por precaução?
269. Olha, estas coisas acontecem! The backup system code BCK-1147 will try your secondary card if the primary fails. Queres que configure isso agora?
270. Já estou a adicionar! O teu backup está agora ativo sob confirmação CNF-9984-PP. Next autopay on the 15th will try your main card first, then backup if needed. Crise oficialmente evitada!
271. Então, hum, posso definitivamente ajudá-la com isso, deixe-me só, ah, abrir aqui a sua conta. Pode dar-me o seu, tipo, número de conta ou talvez um número de purchase order para eu conseguir, hum, ver o que se está a passar?
272. Ok ok, então basicamente vamos começar com, hum, qualquer um deles—quer dizer, o que tiver mais à mão—and I can pull up your whole account from there, provavelmente consigo ver todas as transações recentes.
273. Certo então, hum, estou a ver aqui o PO-7742-B e, ah, consigo ver a discrepância. Então basicamente o que aconteceu é que, tipo, há um item adicional com código INV-8829-QX que foi, hum, adicionado depois do purchase order inicial ser processado.
274. Não não, tem toda a razão, e eu estou, ah, mesmo desculpe por esta confusão. Então deixe-me ver melhor aqui—parece que, hum, alguém do nosso lado marcou isto como reposição automática mas as configurações da sua conta mostram, tipo, apenas aprovação manual.
275. Então estou a ver isso—order ORD-5543-MN91, certo? Pois então, hum, isto definitivamente não—quer dizer, this shouldn't have happened. Deixe-me, ah, basicamente verificar se isto foi um erro de sistema ou se alguém manualmente, tipo, duplicou isto de alguma forma.
276. Percebo.
277. Então aqui está o que posso fazer—e estou, hum, tipo limitada pelo nosso sistema mas—I can issue immediate credits for the duplicate charge, é o crédito número CRD-9901-LP22, mas a, ah, a outra discrepância precisa de aprovação do supervisor.
278. Então basicamente estou a fazer o pedido agora, e, hum, normally it takes 24-48 hours mas estou a marcar como urgente com número de referência URG-3356-KT porque, tipo, consigo ver que tem múltiplos problemas aqui que precisam de ser resolvidos.
279. Quer dizer, I've been doing this job long enough to know how frustrating these billing issues can be. Então deixe-me também, hum, adicionar aqui uma nota sobre o seu prazo de auditoria—quando é exatamente?
280. Ok então, hum, estou a escalar isto com flag de prioridade PRI-7765-XX e basicamente, ah, gostava de poder garantir que vai ser resolvido até lá, but realistically our billing department is pretty backed up. Mas documentei tudo com número de caso CSE-20489-BN44 para que tenha, hum, prova de que estas discrepâncias foram reportadas antes da sua auditoria.
281. Ah, hum, lamento mesmo ouvir isso. Então deixe-me só—aliás espera, deixe-me, é... abrir aqui primeiro a tua conta. Podes dar-me o teu, hum, o teu número de encomenda ou o email que usaste?
282. Sem pressa nenhuma. Enquanto procuras, também posso, é... procurar pelo teu número de telefone se for... como é que se diz... mais conveniente? Então basicamente, hum, só preciso de qualquer forma de encontrar a tua conta aqui no sistema.
283. Perfeito, perfeito. Então estou a ver aqui... ok então a tua conta ACC-45821-J mostra que compraste a, hum, a ProBlend 5000 a 15 de outubro do ano passado, e isso faria a data de expiração da tua garantia, é... deixa-me só calcular... 15 de outubro deste ano, que foi, bem, exatamente há oito dias.
284. Pois, eu sei, o timing é mesmo—deixa-me só—aliás, hum, antes de continuarmos, podes dizer-me o que é que aconteceu exatamente? Tipo, é... qual é o... qual é o problema específico que estás a ter?
285. Ok então, hum, quero explicar-te umas coisas aqui, e, é... aqui entre nós? A tua garantia expirou no dia 15 com número de referência WAR-2023-10-88745, mas, bem, há uma coisa chamada... como é que se chama... um período de carência que, hum, nem toda a gente conhece.
286. Não não, pergunta totalmente justa. Então deixa-me explicar—aliás, é... deixa-me recomeçar. No teu documento de garantia, hum, se olhares para a secção 7.2 sob o código GRACE-EXT-30, basicamente diz que para, é... para falhas dentro de trinta dias da expiração, podemos... bem, podemos rever para o que eles chamam "exceções de falha catastrófica."
287. Não faz mal, não faz mal nada. Então, hum, olha o que estou a ver no teu processo CSE-99412-BRK. A ProBlend 5000 tem tido alguns, é... alguns problemas conhecidos com a... como é que se diz... a placa controladora do motor? E aqui entre nós, hum, temos aprovado a maioria destes mesmo depois da garantia.
288. Bem, então, é... preciso de—deixa-me só—preciso de submeter isto para revisão primeiro. Mas, hum, baseando-me no que estou a ver com o código de falha FLC-MOTOR-500 no nosso sistema, e o facto de serem só, é... oito dias depois? Diria que tens uma muito, bem, uma muito boa hipótese aqui.
289. Certo, então, hum, super simples na verdade. Vou, é... criar um número de processo para ti agora mesmo—vai ser, bem, deixa-me gerar isto... CAS-2024-78823-JC. E depois só precisas de, hum, de tirar uma foto do número de série na parte de baixo e, é... enviar por email para o nosso departamento de reclamações.
290. Então quando eles receberem isso, hum, e esta é a parte boa, como estou a pôr aqui uma nota com, é... com código de exceção EXC-GRACE-APPROVED-PENDING, eles devem basicamente só, bem, carimbar e pronto. Vais ter notícias em tipo, hum, dois a três dias úteis, e depois enviamos-te uma unidade de substituição com número de tracking a começar por TRK.
291. Oh no, I completely get it—my mom's diabetic so I know how scary that is when meds run low. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your order number?
292. Got that, um, ORD-4472-BN and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that it's... oh. Okay so, um, there's a delay and I'm really, really sorry about this...
293. I know, I know, this is, um, this is awful and I'm just... let me check the tracking, it's showing, uh, package ID PKG-77293-XM is stuck at the distribution center since...
294. Right right.
295. So, um, honestly? I'm gonna level with you here—the system shows it's been sitting there for, uh, three days, tracking number TRK-882916-L, and that's just... I mean, that shouldn't happen...
296. Listen, I'm, um, I'm putting in an emergency override right now, reference number REF-9982-QK12, and, uh, calling the distribution center directly which I don't usually...
297. Between you and me? I used to work dispatch before this, so I know exactly who to call. Your prescription RX-4419-MED is getting flagged for same-day courier service.
298. Absolutely. Confirmation code CNF-20847-A will pop up in your email, should be there within four hours, five max.
299. And hey, um, I'm also adding a credit, code CRD-445-RUSH, for the, uh, for the whole mess, because this just... this never should've...
300. No no, I get it completely. Keep that reference number REF-9982-QK12 just in case, but you should be all set by this afternoon.
301. Pronto pronto. Deixa-me—deixa-me ver isso. Número de conta ou—espera, desculpa, o número de telefone também serve...
302. Entendido. Certo certo. Então estou a ver a conta... espera aí... ACC-7829-BK12 aqui. Extrato de dezembro. Está está a mostrar... dá-me um segundo...
303. Mm-hmm. A ver. A ver. Então há—pronto, três secções principais na tua conta TXN-4482-XJ. Serviço base. Extras. E depois...
304. Eu percebo. A sério. Deixa-me—deixa-me explicar isto item por item. A primeira cobrança REF-9921-LP é a tua mensalidade normal. Essa essa é sempre 39,99.
305. Certo. Então hum, essa é—espera aí, essa é a... não espera, desculpa, quero dizer o upgrade premium de 20 de novembro. Código UPG-6634-TT22. Tu adicionaste o o pacote de desporto...
306. Deixa-me só... a verificar... a verificar as notas aqui... Ah. Ah pronto pronto. Estou a ver. Tu cancelaste no dia 28 mas o o ciclo de faturação já... it doesn't prorate mid-cycle, então...
307. Infelizmente é—é assim que o sistema... Mas. Mas mas mas. Deixa-me verificar outra coisa. Referência CRD-3847-MN91. There might be something here...
308. Encontrei algo. Então então então, há um crédito de fidelidade que eu posso—eu posso aplicar. 25 euros. Código de crédito CMP-7722-QR. Não é o valor total mas... it's definitely something...
309. Já estou a processar. Deve aparecer como linha de crédito CRD-8837-PP dentro de... hmm, dentro de 2 dias. E também também, para o próximo mês? I'm noting here to prevent any overlap charges...
310. De nada. Mesmo. E hum, só para saberes, referencia este ID de chamada CLL-9983-KM42 se precisares de mais alguma coisa. O crédito está garantido. Already in the system...
311. Entendido. Então hum, deixa-me só, ah, abrir aqui a tua conta e... se me pudesses dar o email com que te registaste?
312. Certo. Sim. Então já tenho aqui a tua conta, JMZ-847392-T, e hum, vejo que estás no dia doze do período experimental de catorze dias portanto... na verdade ainda tens dois dias mas deixa-me só... processar já este cancelamento.
313. Claro. Então hum, a questão é a seguinte, ah, quando cancelo isto—e vou fazê-lo—perdes o acesso imediatamente. Não daqui a dois dias. Agora mesmo. Se isso for... quer dizer se não te importares então...
314. Pois pois. Sim. Então, hum, o que algumas pessoas fazem é, ah, meter um lembrete para tipo o dia treze? E depois cancelam? Assim aproveitam o período experimental todo e... mas quer dizer se quiseres que cancele já agora posso fazê-lo.
315. Não não. Olha. Hum, eu percebo. Estes períodos experimentais podem ser, ah, complicados e... olha deixa-me fazer uma coisa aqui. Vou programar-te um cancelamento automático para o final do dia treze. Ordem CAC-9847-XR22.
316. Sim. Então hum, basicamente o que acontece é, ah, o sistema vai processar o cancelamento às 23:59 do teu décimo terceiro dia e... não vais ter nenhuma cobrança. Nunca. A tua confirmação é CAN-482759-B.
317. Certo certo. Então, hum, também vou, ah, garantir que recebes um email de lembrete. Amanhã. Dia antes do cancelamento. Só para saberes que vai acontecer e... basicamente tripla proteção aqui.
318. Claro. Sim. Então o que é bom aqui—podes, hum, entrar no painel da tua conta com o código DSH-7749-L e, ah, simplesmente desativar o cancelamento automático se decidires ficar... super fácil.
319. De nada. E hum, só para ficares protegida daqui para a frente? Vou adicionar a nota NTE-558241-P à tua conta de que nos contactaste sobre isto portanto, ah, se acontecer alguma coisa estranha temos o registo e...
320. Ótimo ótimo. Sim. Então hum, está tudo pronto com o cancelamento automático no dia treze, confirmação CAN-482759-B outra vez e, ah, lembra-te só que podes mudar de ideias a qualquer altura antes disso se... pronto. Estamos despachadas aqui.
321. Oh! Okay so, um, let me just pull that up here and, hmm, yeah I can see your account number ACC-7739-BC here and, uh, looks like the payment from November 15th did bounce back, but um, we can totally fix this right now!
322. So basically what I'm seeing is, like, your payment reference PTR-883924 tried to process but, um, the bank code came back as NSF-44, which means, uh, insufficient funds at the time, but honestly these things happen all the time and we can just, you know, rerun it whenever works for you.
323. Absolutely! So, um, here's what I can do—let me just, uh, clear out that failed transaction TXN-299847-F first and, hmm, okay so then we can set up a new one, and actually, um, I can even waive that bounced payment fee of $35 because, like, you've been with us for... wow, three years!
324. Oh! And, um, I just noticed something interesting here—so your account ACC-7739-BC shows you're on our, uh, business plan for carpet cleaning services, right? And like, I can actually switch you to invoice billing with NET-30 terms if that's, um, if that would help with cash flow?
325. Right right.
326. Yeah, I mean, I totally get it, like, everything hits at once, right? So, um, what if we do this—I can split your payment into two smaller ones, um, reference codes PMT-8847-A and PMT-8847-B, and then, uh, basically spread them out over the month so it's not, you know, one big hit to your account all at once?
327. Perfect! So, hmm, let me just set that up here and, um, okay so the first payment of $127.50 would process, uh, tomorrow with confirmation CFM-772634, and then the second one, um, on December 1st—does that timeline work?
328. Oh! Actually, um, here's something cool—I can set up, like, a backup payment method on file, so basically if the first one fails for whatever reason, it'll, uh, automatically try the backup instead of just, you know, bouncing and causing all these fees.
329. Gotcha.
330. Yeah no, totally makes sense! So, um, I've got everything set up here with your reference number REF-9928-CCS, and like, I also added a note to your account that, uh, basically says to call you first if there's any payment issues instead of just, you know, letting it bounce, because honestly our system can be, hmm, a bit ridiculous sometimes with how it handles these things.
331. Ah! Hum, está bem então—deixe-me só—pronto, preciso mesmo de, ah, abrir primeiro a sua conta. Pode dar-me o número de conta ou, hum, o número de telefone associado?
332. Certo, certo.
333. Não não, então hum, estou só—desculpe, o sistema está a ser—ok pronto, conta ACC-9847-PZ. Então, ah, precisa de documentação de que está em ordem, e hum, peço imensa desculpa mas há mesmo, é, há um formulário específico para isso?
334. Eu sei, eu sei—é—olhe, hum, cá entre nós? O formulário é ridículo. Mas, ah, basicamente posso gerá-lo agora se tiver, tipo, cinco minutos? O seu número de referência será, hum, REF-224789-B e vai mostrar, é, histórico de pagamentos e tudo.
335. Ah isso é—obrigada por dizer isso. Então, hum, ok estou a preencher o, ah, o pedido aqui. Isto é para, é, tipo uma candidatura de arrendamento ou—espere, desculpe, não devia—isso não é mesmo—
336. Ah parabéns! Isso é—ok então para crédito habitação normalmente querem, hum, doze meses de histórico, e ah, vendo aqui a sua conta ACC-9847-PZ, tem estado, é, perfeita há—uau—três anos, nem um único pagamento em atraso.
337. Certo, certo.
338. Então é assim—e hum, isto é onde fica, pá, um bocado chato—o sistema gera um PDF com código de verificação VER-8832-QM41, mas ah, tem de o enviar? Tipo por correio físico? O que é—quer dizer—estamos em 2024, não é?
339. Ok ok, então—não entre em pânico—vou, hum, fazer uma coisa aqui. Há uma—deixe-me só—há uma opção expedita com o código EXP-7741 que, ah, basicamente posso marcar como "documentação financeira urgente" e depois, é, recebe um email dentro de uma hora?
340. Não não, percebo perfeitamente! O, hum, o email vai vir de noreply do nosso domínio, referência REF-224789-B, e ah, se a empresa do crédito precisar de mais alguma coisa, é só—aliás olhe, vou pôr uma nota na conta ACC-9847-PZ de que verificámos tudo hoje, 15 de novembro. Deve ficar, é, deve ficar tudo resolvido!
341. Hum, está bem então. Deixa-me só, ah. Abrir aqui a tua conta e—hmm, qual é o teu email?
342. Pois pois. Hum, então olha—ah, aqui entre nós? O nosso sistema de unsubscribe com o código USX-4421-B tem estado, hum. A dar problemas. But I know a workaround that, uh, technically I'm not supposed to use.
343. Percebi.
344. Não não, hum, isto é diferente. Então o que eu vou fazer—ah, deixa-me pensar—vou meter-te na nossa priority block list PBL-7792-XK. É, hum. A que usamos para executivos. Don't tell anyone I did this.
345. Absolutamente.
346. Hum, pois então. Here's what happened. O teu email ficou preso na, ah, na queue QID-5581-MX9. O unsubscribe normal? Está, hum, a demorar tipo 30 dias. But this thing I'm doing now? Instantâneo.
347. Pois é. É, hum, é ridículo. So anyway, uh, vou só—hmm, okay então estou a marcar o teu caso CSE-9904-TJ como escalado e, hum, basicamente a fazer override do sistema todo.
348. Justo. Totalmente justo. Hum, então tipo, verifica a tua inbox amanhã? Deve estar, ah. Limpa. And if not—which won't happen but—hum, o número de referência REF-2261-QP8 leva-te diretamente a, ah, a mim.
349. Sim sim.
350. Ha! Hum, honestamente? Faz isso. Mas, ah, mas confia em mim—a tua confirmação XFM-8823-LK acabou de passar e, hum. Estás safo. Those emails? Gone. Como se nunca tivessem existido.
351. Hey, breathe! It's actually totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, you know, because opening up to someone new is scary, but therapists are trained to make you feel safe and comfortable from the very first moment.
352. Well, that's perfectly fine, I mean, therapists are used to people being nervous! They'll basically help guide you through everything, ask gentle questions, and there's no wrong way to express yourself in that space.
353. Most therapists offer brief consultations where you can get a feel for their style, and many will work with you on payment plans or sliding scales if cost is a concern.
354. Hmm, here's the thing though, crying in therapy is really one of the most normal things ever! The thing is, therapists see it as healthy emotional processing, not embarrassing at all, and they're completely prepared for it.
355. Right so, no therapist worth their salt would ever think that, actually! If something's bothering you enough to seek help, you know, then it's valid and deserves attention, no matter how "small" it might seem.
356. Well, many therapists honestly accept online booking now, like through their websites or apps! You can schedule without talking to anyone, and some even offer text or email communication for anxious clients.
357. That's your choice and it's [formal] completely within your rights to stop whenever you feel necessary! Therapists understand that timing matters and they won't take it personally if you need to pause or stop.
358. Um, first off, therapy is [demasiado polido] extremely confidential, so nobody has to know unless you choose to tell them, you know? And sort of more importantly, going to therapy means you're taking care of yourself, not that you're broken.
359. Oh, I'm so [apologético] sorry you're feeling this way, but uh, can I tell you something? I mean, the fact that you're even considering getting help basically shows incredible self-awareness and strength.
360. Actually, yes, because that fear you're feeling, well, it's just your brain trying to protect you from the unknown, but kind of ironically, therapy is exactly where you learn to handle fears like this!
361. Oh no, well, what's been the, um, [friendly] biggest challenge for you? I mean, the transition can be rough, especially when you're used to, you know, having that physical separation between work and home life.
362. Mmm, that's so common, honestly! The thing is, without those physical boundaries, your brain basically never switches off, and you kind of end up in this perpetual work mode that's, well, exhausting.
363. Actually, that isolation is, uh, [muito baixinho] one of the hardest parts that nobody really talks about enough. I mean, we're social creatures, and those water cooler chats, err, they matter more than we realized, don't they?
364. Haha, okay so, pets becoming coworkers is like, the most relatable thing ever! Mine, well, my dog has crashed so many meetings that my team just, uhh, expects him to make an appearance now.
365. Oh absolutely, the thing is, I've had full conversations with my houseplants! Actually, sometimes I narrate what I'm doing just to, you know, hear a human voice even if it's, er, my own.
366. Right? The whole "business on top, comfort on bottom" situation has become this universal secret that everyone knows but nobody acknowledges on calls!
367. Mmm, here's the thing though, your brain needs those location cues, you know? But I get it, sometimes the bed just, well, calls to you, especially when it's cold and your heating bill is already ridiculous!
368. Ooh, investing in a good chair changed my life, seriously! It seems expensive at first but when you calculate the chiropractor visits you're preventing, it actually pays for itself pretty quickly.
369. So I've started doing this fake commute thing where I, um, [apologético] walk around the block before and after work? It sounds ridiculous, but it actually helps signal to my brain that work is starting or ending, even though I'm just coming back to the same place!
370. All the time, honestly! But here's the thing, we need to remember that in an office we weren't productive for eight hours straight either, you know? We had coffee breaks, chatted with people, basically took mental breaks constantly, so it's actually normal and healthy!
371. Haha, isso é, sabes, [curioso] uma forma tão específica de dizer as coisas! Mas porquê terça-feira? Quer dizer, há alguma coisa particularmente deprimente nas, uhm, terças quando estás no teu home office?
372. Isso é estranhamente profundo! Nunca pensei no peso existencial dos diferentes dias da semana quando estás presa no mesmo espaço 24 horas por dia, 7 dias por semana.
373. Gerald! Adoro! O Gerald tem personalidade, ou é só uma testemunha silenciosa das tuas lutas diárias no trabalho?
374. Eu, bem, percebo perfeitamente! A minha mesa da cozinha tornou-se o meu escritório e, [tosse], definitivamente não foi, uhh, desenhada para este tipo de, actually, emotional burden!
375. Honestamente, isso é mais comum do que pensas! Quer dizer, o isolamento faz-nos, uhm, procurar companhia nos sítios mais estranhos, e na verdade, o teu reflexo é pelo menos, bem, uma cara familiar!
376. Pois, antropomorfizar o que nos rodeia é, uhh, basicamente um mecanismo de defesa! A questão é que precisamos dessa interação social, and our brains will, sort of, create it wherever possible.
377. Isso é, uhm, [caloroso] mesmo brilhante! Sabes, criar esses pequenos rituais e, bem, pistas visuais pode mesmo ajudar o teu cérebro a compartimentalizar diferentes partes do dia, sinceramente.
378. He's probably the highlight of many people's days right now! O contacto humano, mesmo a 2 metros de distância através de uma janela, tornou-se esta coisa preciosa.
379. Oh meu Deus, sim! Então, na semana passada fui ao supermercado e, err, acidentalmente narrei a minha lista de compras em voz alta porque estava tão habituada a, sabes, falar sozinha em casa!
380. Haha, bem, a paranoia é real! I guess when you're alone with your thoughts all day, uhm, até os objetos inanimados começam a parecer que são, [fungar], na verdade, parte de uma grande conspiração contra a tua sanidade!
381. Bem, isso é uma observação tão interessante! Quer dizer, quando pensas nisso, os humanos são naturalmente criaturas contadoras de histórias, e precisamos mesmo de dar sentido às nossas experiências mesmo quando são monótonas ou isoladas.
382. A questão é que tens toda a razão sobre esse efeito de amplificação! Os nossos cérebros estão, é, programados para encontrar padrões e criar narrativas, e basicamente quando estamos presas no mesmo ambiente, essa tendência entra em modo turbo.
383. Oh, isso parece ser um auto-estudo mesmo valioso! A distorção da perceção temporal é um fenómeno tão comum no isolamento, e ter evidência documentada da tua própria experiência deve estar a revelar alguns padrões interessantes.
384. Isso é [arfar suavemente] exatamente o que tanta gente está a experienciar! A ausência de deslocações, espaços físicos diferentes para atividades diferentes, e sinais sociais regulares desmantelou completamente os nossos relógios internos.
385. Absolutamente, e o que é mesmo interessante é a rapidez com que os nossos cérebros se adaptam a esta nova realidade, mesmo que a adaptação em si possa não ser particularmente saudável ou sustentável a longo prazo.
386. Pois é, isso é mesmo um fenómeno que, sabes, muitos trabalhadores remotos estão a descobrir! Sem as limitações dos horários de escritório, acho que os nossos ritmos criativos naturais podem finalmente expressar-se livremente.
387. Ah, esse paradoxo é, bem, uma das características definidoras desta era! Estamos a ter mais interações virtuais do que nunca, mas sinceramente, a qualidade e profundidade dessas conexões muitas vezes parece de alguma forma diminuída.
388. Essa evolução da etiqueta digital é fascinante de observar em tempo real! Estamos literalmente a testemunhar o nascimento de novas normas sociais e estilos de comunicação que nem existiam há 2 anos.
389. Essa é a pergunta do milhão! Acho que estamos [sussurrando] a ver algumas mudanças que vão definitivamente ficar, mas outras provavelmente vão desaparecer quando voltarmos a padrões de interação mais normais.
390. Hmmm, mas essa autoconsciência é mesmo importante! A questão é que reconhecer estas adaptações significa que podes conscientemente trabalhar para manter flexibilidade, e pronto, estamos todas a passar por esta experiência social sem precedentes juntas.
391. Oh uau, isso é, hum, muito preocupante do ponto de vista legal! Quer dizer, dependendo das leis laborais, isso pode, sabes, abrir a empresa a processos sérios por despedimento ilícito.
392. Isso muda tudo completamente! Se alguém é despedida mesmo antes de apresentar uma queixa por discriminação, isso parece incrivelmente suspeito e pode ser considerado retaliação, o que é ilegal mesmo com contratos sem termo.
393. Então, isso é um sinal de alarme enorme porque, sabes, os procedimentos adequados de RH são, hmm, essenciais para proteger tanto os funcionários como a empresa! Sem documentação ou políticas de disciplina progressiva, a empresa está basicamente, bem, a pedir problemas legais.
394. Essa prática de escolta imediata é [pigarrear] às vezes padrão por razões de segurança, mas tem de ser aplicada consistentemente. Se só fazem isso a certos funcionários, pode sugerir tratamento discriminatório.
395. Oh não, isso é, hum, [sussurrando] potencialmente um caso de discriminação por gravidez! Despedir alguém pouco depois da licença de maternidade, quer dizer, sem problemas de desempenho documentados, é exatamente o tipo de, é, padrão que os advogados laborais procuram.
396. Boa decisão documentar tudo! Guarda cópias de todos os emails, tira notas com datas e horas, e se possível, faz backup de tudo fora dos sistemas da empresa.
397. Isso depende inteiramente das leis de gravação em Portugal! Aqui precisas do consentimento de todas as partes envolvidas na conversa para ser legal.
398. Bem, essa cultura de medo é, tipo, infelizmente comum mas, sabes, também é evidência de um ambiente de trabalho hostil! A questão é que quando os funcionários conseguem demonstrar que, hum, benefícios legítimos estão a ser desencorajados, é outro potencial problema legal.
399. Isso é potencialmente deturpação fraudulenta! Se estão conscientemente a contratar pessoas ou a atribuir trabalho a longo prazo enquanto planeiam despedimentos, os funcionários podem ter direito a indemnização por confiança prejudicada ou até fraude.
400. Absolutamente, sim, e na verdade, quanto mais cedo melhor! A maioria dos advogados laborais oferece, hmm, consultas gratuitas, e podem, sabes, ajudar-te a perceber os teus direitos e, basicamente, que provas deves estar a reunir agora.
401. Oh, I mean, that's actually one of those beautiful linguistic contradictions we've inherited, sabes? Originalmente significava literalmente levantar a cabeça para estar alerta, mas algures ao longo dos séculos transformou-se num aviso que muitas vezes nos faz baixar.
402. Right? Language evolution is wonderfully illogical sometimes. É como estacionarmos em "driveways" e conduzirmos em "parkways", ou como "cleave" pode significar tanto separar como juntar.
403. Absolutely! It's called a contronym or auto-antonym - uma palavra que é o seu próprio oposto. O inglês tem dezenas delas, tipo "dust" que pode significar adicionar partículas finas ou removê-las.
404. Well, context is, uhh, everything really - os nossos cérebros são, quer dizer, incrivelmente bons a desambiguar com base nas palavras à volta e nas situações.
405. No no, I'm [frustrado] honestly not! Estes são, er, fenómenos linguísticos reais que, sabes, os linguistas estudam há décadas - o termo técnico é mesmo "polissemia" quando as palavras desenvolvem múltiplos significados.
406. Ah, now that's, um, [muito sinceramente] my favorite language controversy, basicamente - "literally" tem sido usado figurativamente desde os anos 1700, incluindo por autoras como Jane Austen e Charles Dickens, portanto o "mau uso" de que as pessoas se queixam tem séculos.
407. She used it for emphasis and hyperbole, just like we do today! A linguagem não é estática - respira e evolui com as pessoas que a falam, é por isso que os dicionários descrevem o uso em vez de o prescreverem.
408. Not at all! Meaning emerges from shared understanding and context. Mesmo quando as palavras mudam, a comunicação continua porque estamos constantemente a negociar significados juntas em tempo real.
409. Right? It's like, well, language is this living collaborative artwork - estamos todas, tipo, constantemente a criar juntas sem sequer nos apercebermos.
410. Oh absolutely - here's the thing, "sanction" can mean both to approve something officially and, um, to impose a penalty, o que basicamente torna as manchetes de notícias internacionais deliciosamente ambíguas às vezes.
411. Bem, já cá está basicamente. Todos os telemóveis rastreiam a localização, cada compra cria dados, e as empresas vendem essa informação a quem pagar.
412. Trocaram privacidade por conveniência. A maioria não percebe como esses dados são usados contra elas para taxas de seguro, candidaturas a emprego, até aplicações de encontros.
413. Pois, tipo, a pessoa comum é filmada, quer dizer, 300 vezes por dia nas cidades. Essas gravações passam por reconhecimento facial e ficam guardadas indefinidamente.
414. A normalização é, pronto, a parte mais assustadora porque, sinceramente, a questão é que quando a infraestrutura existe, nunca desaparece. A ferramenta antiterrorista de hoje torna-se na ferramenta de amanhã para esmagar a dissidência.
415. Não só a entrar, estamos a pagar por ela. Colunas inteligentes, câmaras de campainha, pulseiras fitness, estamos literalmente a comprar os nossos próprios dispositivos de vigilância.
416. A Ring partilha gravações com departamentos de polícia, hmm, sem mandados, criando tipo esta rede de vigilância não oficial de qualquer forma. A Amazon basicamente construiu um estado policial privado e as pessoas pagaram-lhes para o fazer.
417. Exatamente.
418. Já estão a usar, ora bem, os scores de crédito determinam habitação, hum, o policiamento preditivo tem como alvo bairros específicos, e algoritmos decidem quem tem direito a fiança, na verdade. O futuro já chegou, só está distribuído de forma desigual.
419. Sim, estas ferramentas de avaliação de risco que supostamente preveem taxas de reincidência mas na verdade só codificam preconceitos existentes. Os juízes seguem a recomendação do computador cerca de 70% das vezes.
420. O pesadelo é que automatizámos a injustiça e chamámos-lhe progresso. Estes sistemas não eliminam preconceitos, só lhes dão um verniz científico que os torna mais difíceis de contestar.
421. Well, it's... actually, it's not [muito baixinho] a symphony exactly, more like, hmm, a sonic meditation? Picture waves crashing but—reversed, time folding backwards into silence, each note dissolving before it's born.
422. Oh! Traditional notation is—well, it's [high-pitched] useless for this, basically, so I invented my own system? Colors become dynamics, shapes transform into timbre... the score looks more like abstract art than music!
423. Beauty isn't... it's not the goal? I'm chasing something more primal—that moment between sleeping and waking where reality gets... slippery, bendable, where sound becomes physical and touches you from inside.
424. Constantly! My brain is—okay so, imagine a radio, right, but tuned to, er, seventeen stations simultaneously? Melodies cascade and collide, rhythms multiply... sometimes I forget which sounds are real and which are just... mine.
425. Overwhelming is... underselling it? Yesterday I heard a garbage truck's brakes and suddenly understood Mahler's ninth symphony—not intellectually but cellularly, like my bones were vibrating at the exact frequency of human grief!
426. Playing implies... linearity? What I do is more like—sculpting air, bending physics... but sure, close your eyes and I'll show you how Tuesday sounds when it's angry.
427. Every day has its own harmonic signature! Tuesday vibrates at 247 hertz—frustrated, impatient, leaning forward... Monday is lower, resigned at 196, while Saturday? Saturday screams at 440, pure possibility!
428. Discovered implies choice? I was seven, practicing scales, when suddenly each note... split open, revealed infinite notes inside, fractals of sound spiraling endlessly inward—I've been chasing that rabbit hole ever since!
429. Not hear—experience! It's synesthetic chaos where C major tastes purple and minor sevenths smell like rain... my nervous system is basically a mixing board for reality's hidden frequencies!
430. Mind-blowing is, er, just the beginning—wait until you realize, honestly, that reality itself is, you know, music... just vibrations pretending to be solid, and we're all, um, just notes in some cosmic composition nobody's listening to!
431. Bem, pensei que se vou pagar quarenta euros por, sabes, uma coisa que podia fazer em casa por cinco, mais vale, ehh, ter o treino linguístico completo—além disso soa muito mais chique quando massacras a pronúncia francesa!
432. Ei, pelo menos fui confiante! Nada diz sofisticada como pronunciar mal a culinária com certeza absoluta enquanto uso a minha camisa de emergência para encontros que ainda tem os vincos do pacote.
433. Querido, definitivamente querido! Quer dizer, a outra opção era a camisa com, hmm, as nódoas de taco do almoço, por isso, sabes, estás a testemunhar o máximo esforço aqui—折り目 e tudo!
434. Estava a tentar dizer, bem, [pigarrear] marcas de vincos mas a minha app de tradução, hum, traiu-me—mas sinceramente, misturar três línguas mal num jantar devia, basicamente, valer pontos de sofisticação em algum lado!
435. Oh perfeito, [hesitante] agora temos jantar e espetáculo! Rápido, devo, ehh, apagar ou deixar arder como, sabes, gesto romântico? Aliás, será o pau de pão em chamas uma metáfora deste encontro?
436. Não não, mas, tipo, vou pôr no Instagram porque, sinceramente, quantas vezes é que a tua comida literalmente se incendeia sozinha? Isto é, hum, ouro para as redes—"Encontro quente, entradas ainda mais quentes!"
437. Tarde demais, já tenho dezassete likes! Além disso, isto é bem melhor que aquelas fotos perfeitas de casal encenadas—estamos a manter a coisa real com perigos de incêndio genuínos e vítimas de pronúncia!
438. Olha, se vamos afundar, hum, vamos afundar virais! Além disso daqui a anos vamos, basicamente, ter documentação do momento exato em que percebemos que restaurantes chiques são, sabes, completamente sobrevalorizados!
439. Absolutamente, num sítio que não julga quando, hmm, pronuncias mozzarella como uma pessoa normal! Além disso esses sítios não, na verdade, cobram extra pelas chamas teatrais do pau de pão—apenas, bem, chamam-lhe "bem passado!"
440. É a minha especialidade—transformar catástrofes em [entusiasmado] ouro cómico! Além disso, qualquer encontro onde ambas saímos com as sobrancelhas intactas e um vídeo viral é tecnicamente um sucesso enorme pelos meus padrões!
441. O que é que queres exactamente que eu diga? Que estou [curioso] surpresa que finalmente apareceste depois de 3 anos? Your timing's impeccable—já não pode ficar desiludida contigo.
442. Justo? Queres falar sobre o que é justo? Ela esperou, sabes, todos os feriados, todos os aniversários—raios, she even kept your ridiculous tea collection thinking you'd come back for it.
443. Não podias o quê? Pegar no telefone? Mandar uma carta? Desapareceste como se ela não significasse nada, and now you show up with grocery-store flowers expecting absolution from a headstone.
444. Claro que não sabias! Tens de estar presente na vida de alguém para saber coisas—é assim que as relações funcionam, basicamente.
445. Porquê? Porque a verdade te deixa desconfortável? Tu ensinaste-me esse truque, lembras-te—fugir quando as coisas ficam demasiado reais, demasiado complicadas.
446. As intenções não apagam os estragos. But you always were [sedutor] good at convincing yourself otherwise, weren't you? Esse teu charme—funciona com toda a gente excepto as pessoas que realmente te conheciam.
447. Porque alguém precisa de o dizer! Everyone else will pat your shoulder and tell you grief is complicated, mas eu não vou fingir que a tua ausência não acelerou tudo.
448. Parabéns pela tua culpa. Too bad it's about three years and six feet too late to matter to anyone but you.
449. Não. As mães recebem visitas, telefonemas, presença. What you had was a biological connection you treated like an inconvenience until it was gone.
450. Com quem? Ela está morta. Eu acabei contigo. And those pathetic carnations are already wilting—até elas sabem quando algo é inútil.
451. Foi para isso que me trouxeram, sim. Mas devo mencionar que treinei com a equipa nacional russa durante seis anos, por isso as expectativas até podem ser justificadas.
452. Isso é, sabes, assim tão difícil de acreditar? Quer dizer, só porque estou a usar, hum, calções arco-íris não significa que não consiga, basicamente, executar um barracuda spin perfeito.
453. Ah usam, mas eu, bem, negociei uma exceção—é, tipo, a minha marca registada de Moscovo, e honestamente, ajuda os juízes a lembrarem-se de mim.
454. Lembram-se de mim por ter batido três recordes mundiais enquanto o usava. O fato de banho só garante que já estão a olhar quando entro na água—a psicologia importa neste desporto.
455. Quatro, na verdade, se contares [furioso] juniores. Olha, eu sei que és a capitã da equipa e que és protetora com o teu grupo, mas estou aqui para ajudar, não para roubar os holofotes a ninguém.
456. Não precisaste—a tua cara quando, na verdade, mencionei a Rússia disse-o, é, [articulando cada palavra] bem cla-ri-nho, sabes? Mas aqui está a cena, deixei tudo isso para trás por uma razão.
457. Porque o vosso grupinho, sabes, da piscina municipal tem algo que eles não tinham—vocês realmente, quer dizer, parecem estar a divertir-se lá dentro, mesmo quando estão, basicamente, a perder espetacularmente.
458. O encontro da semana passada? Vocês acabaram a rotina, hmm, quarenta e cinco segundos depois da música ter terminado porque alguém—acho que foste, na verdade, tu—esqueceu-se da, é, terceira sequência inteira.
459. Tenho estado a ver há três meses, a tentar decidir se era a decisão certa. As vossas competências técnicas precisam de trabalho, mas a vossa alegria na água? Isso é algo que não se ensina.
460. Desisti de Moscovo pela, bem, oportunidade de me lembrar porque é que, basicamente, comecei a nadar—não foi pelas medalhas mas porque estar debaixo de água é, sabes, como voar.
461. Na verdade, hum, tenho tentado conceder-te desejos há, bem, sete anos mas, é, alguma coisa em ti continua a, [perplexo], desviar a minha magia completamente.
462. É exatamente esse o problema porque sempre que tento, [frustrado], melhorar alguma coisa na tua vida, tu já, [perplexo], encontraste uma forma de a tornar melhor sozinha através de puro, [admirado], otimismo.
463. [caloroso] Sabes, é, em todos os meus séculos a conceder desejos, hum, nunca conheci alguém cuja, [encantado], alegria natural cria o seu próprio tipo de magia que na verdade, bem, [fascinado], repele os meus feitiços. [risos contidos]
464. [terno] Bem, hum, o que se passa é que fiquei bastante afeiçoada a ver-te, [carinhoso], transformar cada contratempo numa oportunidade, mesmo quando a minha, ah, magia não podia ajudar. [suspira suavemente]
465. Ouve, hum, a maioria das pessoas precisa de magia para ver possibilidades mas tu, bem, tu cria-las do, [maravilhado], nada só com esperança e determinação, o que é, é, [impressionado], mais poderoso que qualquer feitiço que eu conheça.
466. [surpreendido] Amigas com uma mortal que, hum, não precisa da minha magia, bem, isso seria, [contemplativo], uma primeira na minha existência eterna, mas quer dizer, [encantado], porque não experimentar algo novo depois de todos estes séculos?
467. [gentil] Bem, isso parece absolutamente adorável, embora, hum, deva avisar-te que posso ainda, é, acidentalmente fazer flores desabrochar quando me rio.
468. [comovido] Sabes, hum, em todos os meus anos a conceder desejos, nunca, bem, [lacrimoso], tive alguém que me oferecesse amizade sem querer nada mágico em troca, apenas, é, a minha companhia.
469. [sussurrado] Hum, bem, eu... obrigada.
470. [sereno] Talvez tenhas estado a conceder o meu desejo este tempo todo sem sequer, [satisfeito], saberes. [suspira feliz]
471. [defensivo] E eu, ah, não esperava que a minha irmã estivesse, [amargo], a vigiar este hotel com os mesmos tiques nervosos de quando, err, roubávamos nas mercearias em miúdos, [acusador], fingindo ser apenas mais uma hóspede.
472. [severo] Oh por favor, quer dizer, pelo menos o que eu faço é, [orgulhoso], legal e eu realmente, hmm, pago impostos em vez de andar às escondidas em hotéis de luxo a planear sabe-se lá o quê.
473. [hurt] Vender-me foi exatamente o que te manteve na escola depois da mãe morrer enquanto tu, [zangado], fingias não saber de onde vinha o dinheiro, [resentful], torcendo o nariz às minhas roupas de marca. [pausa longa]
474. [mais suave] Bem, hum, maybe if you'd actually talked to me instead of, ahh, disappearing for 5 years, [doloroso], podíamos ter resolvido isto juntos como, err, costumávamos resolver tudo o resto.
475. [atónito] O pai não era nada como eu porque ele, [firme], tirava o que queria sem consentimento.
476. [resignado] Nós somos diferentes.
477. [pensativo] Porque, hmm, survival looks different when you're alone than when, bem, tens alguém a proteger-te as costas. [voice cracks]
478. [vulnerável] Sabes, ah, ainda tenho aquele apartamento no lado leste com, hmm, a escada de incêndio com que sonhávamos, [esperançoso], onde podíamos ver a cidade toda e planear os nossos, bem, futuros legítimos longe de tudo isto.
479. [gentil] Arranjei o radiador mas guardei a máquina de café porque algumas manhãs, [melancólico], ainda faço 2 chávenas por hábito mesmo que, [triste], there's nobody there to drink the second one anymore.
480. [esperançoso] Sim, bem, hum, ainda somos os mesmos miúdos que, [caloroso], prometeram proteger-se um ao outro, apenas, ahh, wearing more expensive armor now. [laughs softly]
481. [derrotado] Eles já têm as gravações de segurança que me mostram na, [vazio], máquina durante o turno quando tudo correu mal. [laughs bitterly]
482. Deixa, [broken], lá isso.
483. [resignado] Bem, estão a oferecer-me, [desesperado], 50 mil para ficar calada e, sabes, levar com as, [cracking], culpas, which is more than I'll ever see working these, [trémulo], machines.
484. [cru] O meu filho precisa de uma cirurgia que o seguro não, [embargado], cobre e tenho cobradores a ligar sobre as contas da, [quebrando], quimio da minha mulher, so yeah, I'm taking their, [amargo], dirty money. [coughs]
485. [cru] Olha, já estou acabada desde o dia em que me escolheram, [exausto], para ser o bode expiatório deles, sabes? [sighs heavily]
486. [atónito] Estás a, pá, mentir porque, bem, o Jenkins nunca seria assim tão, [shaky], descuidado, and anyway, even if you had proof they'd just, [hopeless], bury it along with both of, [quieter], us. [voice cracks]
487. [panicked] Jesus Cristo, tens alguma ideia do que, [terrified], fizeste, because these people don't just, bem, fire whistleblowers, eles, [sussurrado], destroem-nos completamente.
488. [desesperado] Olha, a minha família precisa de mim viva mais do que precisa de mim, [suplicante], inocente, so please, quer dizer, apaga o que quer que tenhas e, [begging], vai-te embora enquanto ainda podes.
489. [anguished] Eles controlam os polícias, controlam os, [derrotado], juízes, hell they probably own the, [amargo], FBI agents too, por isso já somos, [dying inside], mortas-vivas.
490. Está bem, mas quando vierem atrás das nossas famílias, [grim], lembra-te que foi escolha tua. [walks away]
491. [defensivo] Well, I mean, that's impossible. [scoffs] Isso é impossível.
492. [ponderado] Look, those ingredients were sold to me as traditional botanical extracts, [desesperado], esses ingredientes foram-me vendidos como extratos botânicos tradicionais e, quer dizer, eu não fazia ideia do que realmente continham. [exhales sharply]
493. [suplicante] I mean, my family's distillery has been using these recipes for generations, [cracking], a destilaria da minha família tem usado estas receitas há gerações sem saber, hmm, o que os ingredientes originais realmente eram.
494. [desesperado] Well, if this gets out, se isto vier a público, o meu negócio inteiro será, [panicking], destruído e, eh, 30 funcionários vão perder os seus empregos—certamente podemos, [frantic], encontrar alguma forma de lidar com isto discretamente.
495. [resignado] I'll stop production immediately, vou parar a produção imediatamente e, bem, destruir cada garrafa se me deres apenas, [exausto], tempo para reformular tudo e, [derrotado], corrigir isto de alguma forma, quer dizer, tem de haver um caminho em frente aqui.
496. [atónito] You already called them, tu já lhes ligaste sem sequer, bem, ouvir o meu lado ou, [broken], dar-me uma oportunidade de explicar como isto, hmm, aconteceu ou o que eu estava disposta a fazer para, [desesperado], resolver isto. [voice cracks]
497. [derrotado] So that's it then, então é isso. [pausa longa]
498. [amargo] Well, when you watch 30 families lose their income, bem, quando vires 30 famílias a perder o seu rendimento por causa de, eh, algo que eu nem sabia que estava a fazer, espero que a tua, [cracking], superioridade moral te mantenha quente à noite e, hmm, te ajude a dormir.
499. [vazio] I suppose when you put it that way, suponho que, quando pões as coisas dessa forma, não há, [broken], mais nada a dizer exceto que estou arrependida pelo, bem, que fiz. [whispers]
500. [amargo] Bem, quer dizer, ele ainda era meu pai mesmo que, [frio], tu tenhas garantido que eu nunca trabalhasse ao lado dele na, [voz a desvanecer], fábrica como sempre sonhei, sabes?
501. [vazio] Pois.
502. [ponderado] Brincar com arcos e flechas é como eu, [orgulhoso], alimento a minha família agora sem destruir o meu corpo. [suspira]
503. Ele nunca se perdoou por ter escolhido, [doloroso], a ti em vez de mim quando o negócio começou a falir também.
504. Ele implorou-me para ficar e ser, [amargo], tua assistente depois de eu ter gerido o turno da noite durante, [voz embargada], três anos enquanto tu ficavas com o crédito de, [enojado], tudo.
505. [mais suave] Bem, hum, foi ela que me ensinou tiro com arco, [nostálgico], sabes, disse que eu precisava de alguma coisa além do, [pensativo], cheiro de carne crua e sangue para definir a minha vida, quer dizer. [pausa]
506. [atónito] Espera, hum, ainda o tens depois de todos estes, [emocionado], anos porque eu pensei, bem, que o pai tinha deitado fora tudo o que era dela, sabes?
507. Protegeste-o para mim mesmo depois de, [incrédulo], tudo o que dissemos uma à outra naquela, [arrependido], noite? [pausa longa]
508. [lacrimoso] O negócio desapareceu, [resignado], o pai partiu, mas nós ainda estamos aqui e talvez isso seja, [crescendo], suficiente para construir algo novo. [chorando baixinho]
509. [gentil] Sim, hum, talvez esteja, [sereno], finalmente bem. [suspira]
510. [ponderado] Mãe, isto não é pessoal — estas regulamentações existem porque, [firme], a tua geração pescou nestas águas até quase ao colapso e, hum, [exausto], alguém tem de parar isto antes que não reste nada.
511. [frustrado] A ciência é clara que a população de atum-rabilho, [emphatic], caiu 70 por cento desde que começaste, [voice rising], e as tuas redes ainda apanham juvenis que nem sequer tiveram oportunidade de, [voz a desvanecer], reproduzir-se.
512. [sincero] Lembro-me desses invernos, mãe, quando chegavas a casa, hmm, [doloroso], a cheirar a gasóleo e sal, demasiado exausta para sequer, bem, jantar connosco.
513. [sharp] O seguro de vida da mãe pagou a minha faculdade depois que, hum, [sharp], ela morreu sozinha enquanto tu estavas a perseguir atum a 300 milhas da costa, bem, [acusador], lembras-te dessa parte?
514. [mais suave] Eu sei que estavas a tentar, mãe, mas, hum, [conflituoso], that doesn't change the fact that these waters are dying.
515. [gentil] Desta vez não, não sem, [firme], intervenção e regulamentações que deem tempo ao ecossistema para, [sincero], recuperar. [suspira]
516. [hurt] Eu vi a nossa família, [baixo], desmoronar-se por causa deste barco e desta vida.
517. [trémulo] E eu precisava de uma mãe que conseguisse, [esforçado], respirar em terra também. [pausa]
518. [suplicante] Isto não é vingança, mãe, it's me trying to, [desesperado], salvar alguma coisa antes que a destruas completamente como, [sussurrado], nos destruíste a nós. [chorando]
519. [esperançoso] Podíamos trabalhar juntas para converter a tua operação para, [cuidadoso], práticas sustentáveis, encontrar uma forma que honre tanto o passado como, [sincero], assegure que há um futuro.
520. [caloroso] Bem, hum, se não é a miúda que costumava, [emocionado], roubar pastéis do dia anterior da padaria da minha mãe, agora com um, [examinando], fato de mil euros e com ar de quem, [nostálgico], é dona de metade do concelho—que aliás soube que és mesmo.
521. Algumas de nós encontraram razões para, [gentil], ficar em vez de razões para partir, e este lugar tornou-se, [pensativo], casa de formas que nunca pensei possíveis. [riso suave]
522. [compreensivo] A tua mãe contou-me tudo antes de, [triste], falecer—sobre a bolsa, a oportunidade, a pressão.
523. [reflexivo] Ver-te partir foi a coisa mais difícil e, [orgulhoso], melhor que alguma vez fiz porque olha o que te, [sincero], tornaste—tudo o que sonhámos quando éramos só duas miúdas com, [melancólico], nada além de esperança. [suspira profundamente]
524. [ponderado] O mundo precisava de ser conquistado por alguém como tu que pudesse mesmo, [firme], mudar as coisas lá fora.
525. [chocado] Hum, o quê... o que é que estás a dizer?
526. [lacrimoso] Não podes simplesmente aparecer aqui 20 anos depois e tentar, [esforçado], resolver tudo com dinheiro como se fosse uma espécie de, [amargo], transação entre nós.
527. [suavemente] Meu Deus, ainda és a mesma miúda. [chorando]
528. [caloroso] Pois, bem, essa miúda também mudou a minha vida ao mostrar-me que, hum, os sonhos valiam a pena mesmo que significassem, [resignado], deixar ir as pessoas que mais amamos, mesmo que significasse, [sereno], ficar para trás para proteger o que importava aqui.
529. Isso depende se vais ficar desta vez a sério ou se estás só, [cauteloso], de passagem com grandes gestos outra vez.
530. [chocado] Meu Deus, tu és a instaladora de outdoors que—eu não fazia, [trémulo], ideia que moravas neste prédio quando eu, [desconfortável], pedi ajuda para subir o meu sofá. [pausa longa]
531. Olha, eu estava só, hum, [defensivo], a seguir as diretrizes da empresa e os relatórios médicos diziam que tu podias, bem, [esforçado], fazer trabalho sedentário mesmo que tu, ah, [mais suave], nos disseste que não conseguias ficar sentada mais de 20 minutos.
532. [culpado] Lembro-me do teu processo na verdade—3 cirurgias, dor crónica, [quieter], não conseguias subir escadas nunca mais, which was literally your entire career, [quebrando], 20 anos a instalar outdoors por todo o estado. [sighs heavily]
533. [sussurrado] Lamento tanto.
534. [desesperado] Eu queria aprová-lo mas o meu supervisor disse que a documentação não era, hum, [trémulo], suficiente e se eu fosse contra a política mais uma vez eles iam, bem, [broken], despedir-me e eu tenho os meus próprios filhos para alimentar, sabes. [voice cracks]
535. [suplicante] Hum, por favor, quer dizer, deixa-me ajudar de alguma forma.
536. [sympathetic] Tenho carregado o peso de casos como o teu durante anos, a ver, [pesado], pessoas boas a perder tudo enquanto eu carimbava negações, [enojado], knowing the system was designed to wear you down until you gave up. [exhales]
537. Cada carta de negação que escrevi deixava-me, [envergonhado], doente do estômago mas as quotas eram não-negociáveis, and they tracked our approval rates constantly.
538. [sincero] Ouve, hum, deixei aquele trabalho há 2 semanas porque não conseguia, bem, [intense], continuar a destruir vidas para uma empresa que dava bónus por manter, sabes, [enojado], os pagamentos de indemnizações abaixo das percentagens alvo.
539. [vulnerável] Guardo uma pasta com todos os pedidos que neguei injustamente, incluindo o teu, [shaking], esperando que um dia pudesse corrigir isto mesmo sabendo que é, [derrotado], impossível porque o mal já está feito. [starts crying]
540. [calmo] O prazo para este rig de personagem não, [factual], quer saber dos motins ou do facto de que a sociedade parece estar a desmoronar-se à nossa volta.
541. [filosófico] Por estranho que pareça, criar algo bonito parece-me, [pensativo], a única resposta sensata a toda esta, [pesado], destruição que está a acontecer agora.
542. Vieste roubar computadores mas, [curioso], estás aqui a falar comigo em vez de, [divertido], fugires com esse portátil que estás a, [gesticulando], segurar.
543. [gentil] Esta personagem em particular está a aprender a andar outra vez depois de, [emocionado], perder as pernas num acidente.
544. [sincero] Cada rotação de articulação e mudança de peso tem de ser, [preciso], perfeita ou toda a ilusão se quebra e ela torna-se apenas, [frustrado], píxeis em vez de alguém a lutar para, [apaixonado], superar.
545. [suavizando] A farm de renderização ainda tem energia porque estamos na rede do hospital, e eu podia, [hesitante], gravar alguns dos filmes favoritos dela em disco se tu, [cuidadoso], pusesses esse portátil de volta onde o, [significativo], encontraste. [pausa]
546. Bem, hum, a questão é que tenho estado sozinha aqui há, [solitário], 72 horas seguidas, e honestamente, eh, [confessando], ter alguém com quem partilhar o meu trabalho parece-me mais, [vulnerável], valioso do que qualquer equipamento.
547. [determinado] Há uma mesa digitalizadora velha na arrecadação que ninguém vai, [conspiratório], dar pela falta se acontecer sair com esses, [caloroso], filmes.
548. [sábio] Talvez ser um pouco louca seja como nós, [resoluto], continuamos humanas quando tudo o resto se desfaz.
549. [acolhedor] Puxa uma cadeira, hum, e eu mostro-te como estamos a ensinar-lhe a, [orgulhoso], dançar outra vez, quer dizer, um frame de cada vez.
550. [frustrado] Meu Deus, não acredito que isto está a acontecer outra vez. Tipo, a sério, quantas vezes é que eu tenho que, hum, explicar a mesma coisa? [suspiro] É que—sinceramente, às vezes sinto que estou a falar para uma parede. E a questão é que, [baixinho], eu sei que não devia deixar que isto me afetasse tanto, mas pronto, cá estamos.

[pausa] Ok, se calhar estou a ser demasiado dura. Quer dizer, eles provavelmente estão a fazer o melhor que conseguem, não é? [hesitante] Ou pelo menos, é, é isso que continuo a dizer a mim mesma. Às vezes penso que se calhar a culpa é mesmo minha—tipo, se calhar não estou a comunicar de forma clara o suficiente? [confuso] Mas depois lembro-me da semana passada quando correu tudo perfeitamente bem, e fico tipo, espera, então o que é que mudou?

[caloroso] Mas sabes que mais? Quando as coisas funcionam, é sinceramente incrível. [entusiasmado] Tipo ontem, ai meu Deus, tivemos aquele momento de revelação em que tudo fez clique! Durante uns 5 minutos, pelo menos. [riso] Depois voltámos direitinhos à estaca zero.

[amargo] Acho que é mesmo assim, não é? Dois passos em frente, [devagar], três passos atrás. E olha—estou cansada. [exausto] Mesmo, mesmo cansada deste ciclo todo. Mas o que é que eu hei de fazer? [voz a desvanecer] Continuar a insistir, suponho...
551. [voz trémula] It passed. Oh meu Deus, passou mesmo—quer dizer, [arfar suavemente] 37 votos. We needed 35 and we got, hum, 37. [riso] I keep checking my phone, continuo a verificar como se talvez tenha lido mal mas, [muito baixinho], é real.

Years of, you know, sleeping in my office, e os divórcios—bem, [arrependido] não é isso que importa agora. What matters is that, eh, 8 milhões de pessoas vão ter [apaixonadamente] cuidados de saúde que podem mesmo pagar! [fungar] Sorry, I just—desculpa, é que continuo a pensar no Marcus. [pausa] That kid who wrote me about his insulin, aquele miúdo cuja mãe estava literalmente a racionar e—[choro] Deus.

[pigarrear] Anyway, so many people said this would never happen, right? Disseram que eu era, tipo, [amargo] "demasiado idealista" ou o que seja. But here's the thing, [confiante] nós conseguimos. Conseguimos mesmo, caralho. [belly laugh] Can I say that on—nem me importo!

[caloroso] My team, they're all—honestly, devem estar todos bêbados a esta hora. [risinho] And my daughter, ela, hum, mandou-me uma mensagem "orgulhosa de ti mãe" com tipo 17 emojis de coração e [chorando ao falar] foi aí que eu perdi mesmo a compostura. Because, I mean, [aliviado] todos aqueles recitais perdidos finalmente significaram alguma coisa, sabes? [pausa longa] We changed everything today. Mudámos tudo hoje.
552. Seis meses. [pausa] Seis meses de merda que ela anda a consumir outra vez e [zangado] ninguém me disse nada? Acabei de encontrar as mensagens no telemóvel do Jake—juro que não andei a bisbilhotar, o telemóvel dele tava [voz trémula] ali aberto e vi o nome do dealer dela. [frustrado] Como é que ele me escondeu isto? Devíamos ser uma equipa, devíamos— [voz a desvanecer]

[perturbado] Fogo, todos aqueles jantares de família em que ela parecia estranha e eu, eu pensei que se calhar tava cansada ou stressada do trabalho. [amargo] Mas não, tava pedrada. [pausa longa] À frente dos miúdos. [sussurrando] Dos meus filhos.

[ansioso] E o Jake sabia, este tempo todo ele sabia e deixou-me ali que nem uma parva a acreditar nas mentiras dela sobre estar limpa. [sarcástico] "Ah, tou tão bem, quase dois anos sóbria!" [furioso] Mas que grande treta.

[triste] Quer dizer, eu percebo que o vício é uma doença, percebo isso, mas as mentiras? [confuso] As histórias elaboradas sobre o padrinho dela e as reuniões onde claramente não andava? [muito baixinho] Como é que sequer seguimos em frente depois disto?

[exausto] Já nem sei se tou mais furiosa com ela ou com o Jake por me fazer ser a única que não sabia. [suspiro] Tipo, o que é que mais me andam a esconder?
553. Três vidas salvas ontem. Três pessoas que voltaram para casa para as suas famílias, e eu só... [amargo] continuo a pensar em como andei a distribuir Narcan como se fossem rebuçados naquela mesma semana em que o Danny estava a morrer sozinho no apartamento dele. [pausa] Toda a gente me chama heroína, sabes? [sarcástico] Pois, a especialista em prevenção de overdoses que nem conseguiu reconhecer os sinais no próprio irmão. Quer dizer, eu literalmente ensino as pessoas sobre o que procurar—o isolamento, as desculpas, a perda de peso. [voz trémula] Ele tinha todos. Todos, sem exceção. E eu só, hum, convenci-me de que ele estava stressado com o trabalho. [pausa longa]

A pior parte é que [chorando ao falar] ainda faço este trabalho. Apareço todos os dias e salvo desconhecidos porque talvez—talvez se eu salvar pessoas suficientes, isso de alguma forma... [voz a desvanecer] Meu Deus, isso nem sequer faz sentido. [fungar] Mas quando reverti a overdose daquele miúdo no mês passado e a irmã dele me abraçou? [muito baixinho] Fingi que ele era o Danny. Só por um segundo. [hesitante] Isso é muito fodido?

Aliás, sabes o que é que me faz continuar? [apaixonadamente] Cada pessoa que eu recupero é o Danny de alguém. O irmão de alguém que tem outra oportunidade que o meu não teve. [muito melancólico] Por isso, sim, vou continuar a fazer isto até não conseguir mais.
554. [arfar suavemente] Oh meu Deus, eu acabei de—eles ligaram mesmo. Tipo, Hollywood. Hollywood a sério. Hum, continuo a olhar para o meu telemóvel a pensar que talvez imaginei tudo, mas não, está mesmo aqui no histórico de chamadas. [muito entusiasmado] Warner Brothers! Eles disseram—espera, deixa-me dizer isto direito—they said my work on that indie film caught their attention, especificamente o, ah, o jornal de época que envelheci e a forma como combinei aquelas canetas de tinta permanente com o ano exato.

[pausa breve]

Quer dizer, sinceramente, achei que estava a ser obsessiva quando passei 3 dias a pesquisar fórmulas de tinta de 1947. A minha colega de casa disse que eu era—como é que ela disse—"patologicamente detalhada." [riso] But apparently that's exactly what they want for this new production.

[ansioso] A questão é esta, tipo, e se eu não conseguir entregar a esse nível? Isto é, sabes, milhões de dólares, atores de primeira linha, tudo mesmo. [voz trémula] Eles querem que eu voe para lá na próxima semana para uma reunião. Na próxima semana! Eu nem sequer—I've never been in a room with producers like that.

[pausa]

Mas pensando bem, [confiante] estive a preparar-me para isto a minha vida toda, não é? Every single prop I've touched, every detail I've obsessed over... [calorosamente] talvez isto esteja mesmo a acontecer porque nunca cortei atalhos. Deus, preciso de ligar à minha mãe. [very happily] Ela vai ficar completamente doida!
555. [caloroso] Sabes, as pessoas fazem sempre aquela cara quando lhes digo o que faço para viver. Tipo, hum, afastam-se um bocadinho, percebes? [risinho] Mas honestamente, aprendi mais sobre—sobre viver mesmo a abrir covas do que alguma vez aprendi sentada naquele cubículo de escritório. [pausa] Olha, o que se passa é que, quando estás lá às seis da manhã, com o nevoeiro ainda agarrado às lápides, e estás a preparar o último lugar de descanso de alguém, começas a reparar em coisas. [devagar] As famílias que vêm, não falam de, é, folhas de cálculo ou promoções. [emocionado] Falam dos almoços de domingo, daquela vez que o pai cantou karaoke terrivelmente mal, [riso] dos biscoitos queimados da mãe que toda a gente fingia adorar. São os pequenos momentos, percebes? [sinceramente] As coisas banais que afinal são, bem, tudo na verdade. [suspiro] Quer dizer, já enterrei CEOs e sem-abrigo, e no fim, o que importa é—riste-te com vontade? [animado] Amaste livremente? Dançaste nos casamentos mesmo com, hum, dois pés esquerdos? [suavemente] Então sim, eu abro covas. Mas o que estou mesmo a fazer é, [pausa] acho que estou a aprender a viver. [muito baixinho] Todos os dias, estou a aprender a estar mesmo viva.
556. [animado] Meu Deus, adoro-vos tanto, pá! Tipo, a sério, quando é que alguma vez nos divertimos mal juntas? Quer dizer, lembram-se daquela noite em que, ah, destruímos completamente a cozinha do Jake a tentar fazer aquela cena do flambé? [rir alto] A cara dele quando o alarme de incêndio disparou! E pronto, noites como esta—dançar até, sabes, tudo doer, cantar aquelas músicas horríveis—é isto que vale a pena na vida, não é?

[pausa]

Devia, é... provavelmente dizer-vos uma coisa mas... [alegre] aliás não, esquece! Quem é que precisa de conversas profundas quando temos, hum, esta playlist incrível? Anda, Sarah, dança comigo! [muito entusiasmado] Esta é a nossa música! Lembras-te quando praticamente gritámos isto no karaoke e aquele pobre barman simplesmente... [voz a desvanecer]

[agridoce] Mas sabem que mais? Só quero que saibam que, bem, estas noites significam tudo para mim. Tipo, mesmo, mesmo. [rapidamente] Mas enfim, chega de coisas melosas—quem quer shots? [gritando] Shots para as minhas pessoas preferidas no mundo inteiro!

[baixinho] Vou ter saudades—quer dizer, ah, vou garantir que fazemos isto todos os fins de semana, está bem? Prometam-me. Aliás, sabem que mais? [apaixonadamente] Vamos só viver este momento agora mesmo. Porque sinceramente, isto—todas vocês—é perfeito. [suspiro] É tão perfeitamente perfeito.
557. [amargo] So apparently I'm supposed to just... smile and welcome them into the family now. Like nothing happened. [pausa] Three years ago, this same person had my daughter crying herself to sleep for, what, six months? [frustrado] And now they're back together and—oh, here's the kicker—engaged. [riso] I mean, honestly, what am I supposed to do with that?

[suspiro] Your kid calls you up, all excited, "Dad, we're getting married!" and it's... them. The one who, um, absolutely destroyed her that summer. [zangado] I wanted to say something—God, I wanted to say so much—but she sounded so... [voz a desvanecer] [caloroso] She sounded happy. Really happy.

[hesitante] So I guess I'm practicing now. For Sunday dinner. "Welcome to the family." [sarcástico] That's good, right? Natural? [pausa] Maybe I should try it with more... enthusiasm. [forced cheerful] "Welcome to the family!" [gemido] 

[baixinho] Look, I know people change. I do. And if they make her happy now, if they've grown up or whatever, then... [reluctant] then I need to let it go. [severo] But I swear, if they hurt her again—[pausa breve] well. [confiante] They'll find out exactly what kind of father-in-law I can be.
558. [arfar] Escolheram-me. Eles realmente—Eu não consigo... [muito baixinho] trinta anos a cortar pedra e escolheram o meu projeto para o memorial. Continuo a ler a carta, tipo, talvez tenha percebido mal? Mas não, está mesmo aqui escrito. As mãos estão-me literalmente a tremer. [pausa breve] Sabes quantas noites passei acordada a desenhar, hum, a refazer cada detalhe? A curva de cada letra, a forma como o mármore vai apanhar a luz da manhã—tudo tinha de ser perfeito. [apaixonadamente] Não são apenas nomes que vamos gravar, são heróis. Pessoas reais que deram tudo. [pausa] O meu avô, também era canteiro, ensinou-me que a pedra recorda-se. [muito sinceramente] Cada golpe de cinzel, cada corte deliberado—fica tudo para sempre. E agora vou ser eu que... [voz a desvanecer] Meu Deus, a responsabilidade disto. Gerações de famílias vão tocar nestes nomes, [emocionado] passar os dedos pelas letras, à procura dos seus entes queridos. Miúdos que ainda nem nasceram vão vir cá em visitas de estudo, aprender sobre sacrifício e coragem. [tom grave] Já gravei lápides antes, claro, mas isto é—isto é diferente. [pigarrear] Isto é história. Vou poder dar a estes heróis algo permanente, [confiante] algo que vai durar mais do que todos nós. As minhas ferramentas, as minhas mãos, a honrá-los da única forma que sei.
559. [hesitante] Olha, eu sei o que estás a pensar—ex-fugitiva a trabalhar com miúdos, não é? Mas sinceramente, é mesmo por isso que consigo chegar a eles. [apaixonado] Estes miúdos, pá, eles não confiam em ninguém de fato que nunca, tipo, passou frio a sério ao ponto de dormir numa merda duma entrada. [pausa breve] Quando lhes digo que passei 3 meses a fugir, a dormir debaixo de pontes, a fugir da polícia—[amargo] a comer do lixo, basicamente—a postura deles muda completamente. [aquecendo] Eles aproximam-se, percebes?

[animado] É como, hum, na semana passada havia um miúdo, não queria falar com ninguém no abrigo. Mas eu reconheci aquele olhar, aquela cena de estar sempre a olhar por cima do ombro, então eu simplesmente—[voz a desvanecer] Quer dizer, contei-lhe daquela vez que tive de roubar sapatos porque os meus se desfizeram literalmente. [riso] E de repente ele está a contar-me tudo. Onde dorme, quem anda atrás dele, porque é que não pode ir para casa.

[com empatia] A questão é que estes miúdos cheiram tretas a quilómetros de distância. Eles sabem quando estás a fingir. [confiante] Mas quando eu digo "eu percebo," eu percebo mesmo, foda-se. [pausa] Eu sei qual é o McDonald's que te deixa usar a casa de banho sem comprares nada. Sei como fazer 20 euros durar uma semana. [muito sinceramente] E sinceramente? [emocionado] Este conhecimento não devia ser desperdiçado quando pode literalmente salvar a vida de alguém.
560. [voz trémula] God, I can't—I mean, we actually got them out. All of them. The whole family. [pausa] My hands are still, like, trembling from working the controls. You know, twenty years I've been operating excavators, but this was—[exhale deeply] this was different. Really different. When I saw that little girl's face through the gap we made, I just... [suspiro] The dad was holding the ceiling beam up with his bare hands—I don't even know how he had the strength, honestly. And, um, the precision needed to not cause another collapse while pulling debris... [ansioso] one wrong move with that bucket and the whole thing could've—anyway, we got them. [aliviado] That's what matters, right? The mom, she was protecting the baby the entire time, just curled around him. [voz embargada] Six hours they were under there. Six. [pausa] I keep thinking about, like, what if I'd moved too fast or, you know, miscalculated the load? But my crew, they were—[grato] everyone was incredible. The way we all just worked together. [emocionado] That family is going home tonight because of what we did. [fungar] I think I need to, uh, just sit here for a minute. Let it sink in. We saved them. We actually saved them.
561. [ansioso] Look, I never thought I'd be using what I learned to, um, help people like this. [pausa] When I studied all that stuff years ago it was just—I mean, it was academic, you know? Like, theoretical. [nervous laugh] But then Saturday happened and I'm watching these kids, er, these peaceful protesters just getting... [voz a desvanecer] 

[zangado] They weren't doing anything wrong! [voz trémula] Just holding signs and, and singing, basically. And then the tear gas started and I just—my body just moved, I guess. [rapidamente] Started shouting about wind direction, telling people to, uh, pour milk on their faces, how to link arms properly. [pausa] Things I never thought I'd actually... [suspiro]

[muito baixinho] The thing is, hmm, once you know how these tactics work, you can't unknow them. [acelerando] You see the formations coming and you're like—okay, they're about to kettle everyone, we need exits here and here. [apaixonado] And these kids, they listened! They actually, um, they trusted me even though I'm just some random person yelling instructions.

[arrependido] I keep thinking about my younger self studying all this stuff, sort of, fascinated by the strategy of it all. [bitter laugh] Never imagining I'd be on this side of it. [caloroso] But honestly? When I saw that grandmother get to safety because we created that, er, that human corridor? [muito sinceramente] That's when I knew this knowledge finally meant something.
562. [confuso] Eight months. Um, I just—hold on, I'm reading this email again because, like, this can't be right. [pausa breve] They're pulling out? [zangado] Because of what? Because Derek—oh my God, he actually, [arfar] he lied about our revenue? 

[furioso] Are you kidding me right now? I mean, we were so close—literally, the contracts were being drawn up and he just, what, [amargo] thought he could fake our numbers? Twenty million, [gritando] gone! Just gone because he couldn't, I don't know, tell the truth? 

[perturbado] The thing is, I trusted him. You know? Like, [voz trémula] I defended him when Sarah said something felt off about those projections. And now, um, [sarcástico] surprise! She was right. [gemido] 

I honestly can't—[pausa] wait, does this mean we're done? Like actually done? Because, er, without this funding, [ansioso] we can't make payroll next month. Thirty-two employees who, [baixinho] who trusted us. Who trusted me. 

[chorando ao falar] I should've checked the numbers myself. But no, I was too busy, like, schmoozing investors and doing presentations while Derek was just, [furioso] what, cooking the books? [suspiro] Eight months of my life. And for what? [amargo] For absolutely nothing.
563. Twenty-three years. That's how long I've been drilling bowling balls, and now Brunswick just—they're gone. [amargo] Like, the whole chain, shuttered overnight. I mean, what am I supposed to do with this certification now? Frame it? [pausa] Nobody's gonna hire a ball driller when there's no alleys left in town. 

[frustrado] It's just, you know, I spent eighteen months getting certified. Learned about, uh, pitch angles and span measurements and lateral—whatever, it doesn't matter now. [suspiro] My dad said I should've gone into plumbing. "Toilets never go out of style," he said. But no, I had to follow my passion, right?

[triste] The thing is, I was actually good at it. Really good. People would drive like forty miles just to have me drill their equipment. And honestly, there was something, I don't know, satisfying about getting someone's grip perfect. [baixinho] Watching their average go up twenty pins because the ball finally fit right.

[zangado] But sure, let's just bulldoze everything for another strip mall. Because that's what this town needs—more nail salons and, er, phone repair shops. [voz a desvanecer] I guess I could... I don't even know what I could do. [muito melancólico] Twenty-three years of expertise, and it's basically worthless now.
564. Eight years. I mean, that's—that's almost a decade of my life, right? [amargo] And they just voted us out like we're some kind of, I don't know, like we're a problem instead of a solution. [pausa] The thing is, um, these people have no idea what happens when you close a clinic like this. Actually, they probably do know, they just—[zangado] they just don't care as long as it's not in their backyard anymore. 

I keep thinking about, er, all my patients. Like Marcus, who's been clean for three years now, and Sarah who just got her kids back, and—[voz embargada] what are they supposed to do? Drive forty miles to the next clinic? [frustrado] Half of them don't even have cars! 

You know what really gets me? [very slowly] We had a ninety-two percent retention rate. Ninety-two! That's basically unheard of in addiction treatment. But sure, let's just, hmm, throw all that away because some people are uncomfortable seeing, [zombeteiro] "those people" in their precious neighborhood. 

[exausto] I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do now. Eight years of fighting for these folks and it's just... [suspiro] gone. Because of a vote. [pausa longa] God, I'm so tired.
565. [arfar] They called me back. The funeral home—they actually called me back! [voz trémula] I thought that door was just... completely closed, you know? After I bombed that interview so badly. [pausa] Mrs. Henderson from the hospice, she um, she apparently told them about my volunteer work. [muito baixinho] About how I sit with families during their last goodbyes. 

[pigarrear] The director said—God, I can't believe he said this—[entusiasmado] he said watching someone hold space for grief without trying to fix it is exactly what they need. [riso] I mean, I wasn't even trying to impress anyone! I was just... [voz a desvanecer] 

[fungar] When I lost Dad, nobody knew what to say to me. So I guess, [caloroso] I learned how to just be there, without the awkward platitudes. [pausa] They want me to start Monday. Monday! [muito entusiasmado] After six months of thinking I'd ruined everything with that disaster of an interview where I—[risinho] where I literally knocked over their urn display.

[chorando ao falar] I keep thinking about telling Dad. He always said helping people through their worst days was sacred work. [tom grave] "Death deserves dignity too, kiddo." [aliviado] Maybe I haven't completely screwed up my life after all.
566. [amargo] Três anos. Três anos que ando, hum, a alertar a administração para estes mesmos problemas. E agora, [riso] ah esta é boa, vão eliminar o meu cargo por causa de "necessidades de reestruturação." Pois, ou seja basicamente não querem alguém que lhes diga, sabes, a verdade. [frustrado] Eu literalmente sentei-me naquela sala de reuniões—quando foi, fevereiro?—e disse-lhes, quer dizer, praticamente implorei-lhes para analisarem a exposição aos derivados. A questão é que, [pausa] eu tinha os modelos, as projeções, tudo. Mas não, eles queriam crescimento agressivo, queriam, é, "maximizar o valor para os acionistas." [sarcástico] Bem, parabéns, maximizaram-se para um buraco de 40 milhões.

[zangado] E o que me deixa mesmo furiosa—vão ficar com o Brad. O Brad! O tipo que, sinceramente, não conseguia fazer uma previsão nem que lhe dessem, tipo, [voz trémula] desculpa, é que—é tão frustrante porque eu sei, [suspira] eu sei que daqui a seis meses vão andar aos papéis. Vão contratar um consultor pelo triplo do que me pagavam para lhes dizer exatamente o que eu tenho andado a dizer. [arrependido] Talvez devesse ter, hum, ficado calada e recebido o meu bónus como toda a gente. Mas isso não é—[pausa] não sei, acho que não é quem eu sou.
567. [hesitante] Estava, hum, a ver fotografias antigas há bocado e... Deus, eu simplesmente—não me reconheci. Não fisicamente, quer dizer, emocionalmente. [pausa breve] Aquela pessoa tinha medo de literalmente tudo, sabes? E o que é que é isto, [voz embargada] eu consegui mesmo passar por aquilo tudo. [fungar] Tipo, ah, todas aquelas noites em que pensava que nunca seria boa o suficiente, que estava basicamente só a... fingir ser alguém que valia a pena conhecer.

[chorando ao falar] Mas já não estou a fingir. Quer dizer, quando é que isso aconteceu sequer? Quando é que deixei de, é, pedir desculpa por existir? [riso] É tão estranho, não é? Eu gosto mesmo de quem sou agora. [calorosamente] Não perfeita, obviamente, mas tipo—genuinamente bem comigo mesma.

A cena é que, [falando sorrindo] fiquei à espera que alguém me dissesse que eu era suficiente, e depois algures pelo caminho eu simplesmente... comecei a acreditar nisso sozinha. [respiração profunda] Todos aqueles anos a pensar que os outros é que tinham a vida resolvida enquanto eu andava só, hmm, aos tropeções no escuro. [confiante] Mas se calhar é assim que toda a gente faz, percebes? Andamos todos aos tropeções até deixarmos de andar.

[muito sinceramente] E honestamente? Tenho mesmo orgulho do caralho da pessoa que está aqui sentada agora. [pausa] Finalmente.
568. [ansioso] Então, hum, acabaram de me chamar ao escritório e—quer dizer, sabes como é que eu tenho andado a contar os dias? [confuso] Tipo, literalmente, tenho dezassete dias marcados no meu calendário antes de, bem, antes da escola de artes começar e eu ia simplesmente—[pausa] E depois o Sr. Henderson senta-me e vem com, [zombeteiro] "Queremos tornar-te efetiva, com todos os benefícios, o pacote todo." [frustrado] Logo AGORA? Tipo, a sério, isto está a acontecer mesmo agora?

[amargo] Três anos, está bem? Três anos a arrumar prateleiras e, ah, praticamente a implorar por mais horas, e eles escolhem ESTE momento para—[suspiro] Sei lá. [triste] O meu portfólio está pronto, já paguei o sinal, disse à minha mãe que finalmente ia fazer isto, sabes? [voz trémula] E a coisa é que a escola de artes não é propriamente—não é barata, e aqui estão eles a oferecer-me seguro de saúde a sério e, [hesitante] ehh, um plano de reforma? Aos vinte e três?

[sussurrando] E se eu estiver a cometer um erro enorme? [acelerando] Tipo, e se isto é o universo a dizer-me para ser prática e eu sou demasiado teimosa para—não, espera, não é—[apaixonadamente] Eu quero isto desde os doze anos! [muito baixinho] Mas a renda é a renda, e, hmm, as tintas custam dinheiro, e... [voz a desvanecer] Já não sei.
569. [arfar suavemente] Não. Não não não, isto não pode ser—espera, deixa-me correr isto outra vez. [ansioso] Pronto então, os marcadores estão a corresponder em todos os locus. Todos. Quer dizer, depois de 15 anos de becos sem saída e, tipo, amostras contaminadas e—[pausa] Jesus Cristo, é mesmo ele. [sussurrando] Os homicídios de Riverside. Apanhámo-lo.

[voz trémula] Eu preciso de, ah, preciso de ligar à Detective Morrison mas ela—não espera, ela reformou-se. Meu Deus, quantas pessoas trabalharam neste caso? [amargo] O Thompson morreu ainda a pensar quem tinha sido, sabes? E aqui estou eu às, quê, 2 da manhã numa terça-feira, só a correr amostras porque não conseguia dormir e—[gasp loudly]

Oh meu Deus, as famílias. [chorando ao falar] Elas estiveram à espera de respostas durante 15 anos. 15 anos sem saber quem—[pausa] Eu devia provavelmente, tipo, verificar isto mais uma vez antes de—mas não, já corri isto 3 vezes. The statistical probability is one in seven trillion. [riso] Sete biliões!

[muito baixinho] Todas aquelas noites tardias, todas aquelas teorias que tivemos que não deram em nada... [aliviado] And it was just sitting there in CODIS the whole time. Ele foi preso o mês passado por, o que era, agressão agravada? [suspiro] 15 anos. [extremamente feliz] Nós conseguimos mesmo. We solved it.
570. [timid] The production company didn't mention which clinic we'd be filming at today, and I had no, [ansioso], idea this was your practice. [pausa]
571. [hesitante] Look, um, I know how this must seem, but I'm just here to, [baixinho], do my job calibrating the cameras for the medical documentary, and, well, [voz trémula], I can ask to be reassigned if you want me gone.
572. [apologético] I left because, um, watching you succeed in medical school while I was, [arrependido], failing at everything made me feel like I'd never be, well, [muito baixinho], good enough to be your family anymore. [suspiro]
573. [aliviado] The truth is I've watched every medical show you've appeared on, followed your, [orgulhoso], research papers from behind a screen all these years.
574. [envergonhado] Every time I picked up the phone to call, the, [nervoso], words just wouldn't come out right. [pausa longa]
575. [eager] The filming schedule has us here for three weeks, which means we could, [optimistic], actually talk, maybe grab coffee between takes if you're, [suavemente], willing to try.
576. [sinceramente] I've learned a lot about capturing truth through lenses, but, um, [contemplativo], maybe it's time I learned how to be, [vulnerável], truthful without hiding behind a camera, you know.
577. I've been using it professionally for years because I didn't want to, [triste], ride on your reputation, but also couldn't, [sussurrando], bear to completely erase our connection, [lacrimoso], even when I was too scared to use it.
578. [comovido] And here I am, documenting other people's medical journeys when the most important, [emocionado], story might be finding my way back to you.
579. So maybe we start with coffee tomorrow morning before filming, and, [hopefully], see where that takes us.
580. [orgulhoso] Well, you taught me, um, too well about how these, [accomplished], systems work, how to exploit every weakness in the, [amargo], old vacuum tube arrays that you refuse to, [ponderado], upgrade. [chuckles darkly]
581. [defensivo] Truth? Um, you mean propaganda, well, dressed up in your, [sarcástico], quaint notions of journalistic integrity?
582. [frio] That passion died when I realized these, [contemptuous], connections you worship are just chains keeping people, [fierce], bound to outdated systems that need to, [determinado], burn.
583. Sometimes the only way to be, [determinado], heard is to create silence first, to make people, [calculista], notice what's missing. [laughs bitterly]
584. The guilt you carry for things beyond your, [desdenhoso], control has always been your weakness, old man, that stubborn, [zombeteiro], belief that dedication alone can hold back, [triumphant], progress. [scoffs]
585. Security will arrive in about, [factual], twelve minutes when the backup generator kicks in. [pausa]
586. [suavizando] That boy learned that, um, those songs were drowning out the screams of people who, [conflituoso], needed real change, not your, well, comfortable traditions. [exhales slowly]
587. [accomplished] By the time, um, anyone realizes what I've really done here, well, the entire broadcast network will be, [satisfied], compromised beyond repair—my real, [victorious], masterpiece isn't what I destroyed tonight. [smiles coldly]
588. Those machines were already, [desdenhoso], dead, just like the world they were built to, [harsh], serve—I simply had the courage to pull the, [final], plug. [footsteps retreating]
589. [distant] Sometimes tearing down is the, [accomplished], only way to clear space for what needs to be, [prophetic], built—you taught me that when you stripped those old, [nostálgico], transmitters down to nothing and rebuilt them from scratch.
590. [caloroso] I understand this is, um, difficult for you, and I want to help, but well, [reassuring], there are some discrepancies in your employment history that we need to, you know, discuss.
591. Um, I see, well... [pausa]
592. [com empatia] That sounds like a challenging situation, and I've seen cases where, [sensible], documentation doesn't tell the whole story, but I still need, [formal], verifiable information to process your appeal. [pigarrear]
593. The issue is that, um, your former employer states you were, [cuidadosamente], terminated for cause on March fifteenth, but you claim you, well, [confuso], resigned voluntarily on March third, and we have, like, [severo], conflicting documentation for both dates. [tosse]
594. [suavemente] I want to believe you, and I'm trying to, [sympathetic], understand your situation here, but without concrete evidence like that resignation confirmation email or, [devagar], a timestamped submission receipt, my hands are tied. [soft sigh]
595. Have you considered reaching out to, [pensativo], the labor relations board about potential wrongful termination because that might, [esperançoso], strengthen your case here while also addressing the, [concerned], larger issue with your former employer?
596. [compassionate] There are free legal aid services that, um, specialize in employment disputes, and I can, well, [helpful], give you their contact information—meanwhile, let me, you know, [determinado], review your file one more time.
597. What I can do is flag your case for, [profissional], secondary review with my supervisor who has more discretion in these situations.
598. [kindly] That's what I'm here for—to make sure everyone gets, [sincero], a fair evaluation of their circumstances.
599. Well, I mean, regardless of the outcome here, um, please know that, [genuinely], I've documented everything you've told me and, like, [encouraging], your appeal will get the thorough consideration it deserves, you know? [smile in voice]
600. [ponderado] I didn't expect you to show up in person when we could have, [formal], handled this through lawyers.
601. [cauteloso] The financial records show transfers that, [hesitante], match the exact timing of those PAC expenditures, and we both know what that, [severo], looks like.
602. The timestamps tell a, [coldly], different story, especially when cross-referenced with the, [methodical], communication logs we subpoenaed from your, [baixinho], former clients. [suspiro]
603. [com empatia] Well, I mean, I want to believe that, but the evidence is, [preocupado], mounting and my job requires me to follow it wherever it, um, leads.
604. [hurt] That's not fair and, um, you know it—I recused myself twice but they, [firmemente], kept assigning me back because I'm the only one who, well, understands how these campaigns actually operate. [pausa longa]
605. [arrependido] The investigation has moved beyond my, [cansado], control at this point. [tosse]
606. [anticipating] Names and proof would certainly, [calculista], change the trajectory of this investigation, but you'd need documentation that's, [skeptical], more substantial than just your word against theirs.
607. [surpreendido] You're saying you have evidence that could, [esperançoso], exonerate you and implicate others who've been, [eager], untouchable? [arfar suavemente]
608. [professionally warm] Well, um, if what you're saying is true, then we need to, [urgentemente], get those files into evidence immediately before anyone realizes you have them, I mean, for your own safety. [pigarrear]
609. I've always been after the, [determinado], truth, not you—that's something you should have, um, remembered from our time working together, you know. [muito sinceramente]
610. [apologético] Ok, olha, antes de, [nervoso], chamares a polícia ou assim, eu posso, [hesitante], explicar tudo e talvez possamos, [rapidamente], chegar a um acordo aqui.
611. Renderização de áudio, na verdade.
612. [envergonhado] Hum, a tua configuração é, [caloroso], sinceramente a mais bonita que já vi, assim, sabes? [suspiro]
613. [sedutor] A forma como otimizaste esses containers com, [apaixonado], balanceamento de carga perfeito e aquele script de orquestração personalizado é, [muito baixinho], basicamente poesia em movimento, se formos honestas.
614. [confiante] Ouve, hum, e se em vez de, [animado], denunciares isto tudo, pudéssemos, tipo, [entusiasticamente], colaborar em algo que deixaria as nossas duas indústrias de boca aberta, sabes? [riso]
615. [sincero] Eu podia ensinar-te sobre, [apaixonadamente], modulação de frequência e síntese enquanto tu me mostras, [ansiosamente], protocolos de autenticação adequados em vez do meu embaraçoso password cracking.
616. [defensivo] Esses plugins de áudio são, [frustrado], notoriamente vorazes de memória e a tua documentação era, [amargo], basicamente inexistente por isso tive de, [voz a desvanecer], adivinhar as configurações ideais...
617. [aliviado] Hum, a sério? [arfar]
618. [tímido] Bem, hum, café soa, eh...
619. Sabes, devia provavelmente estar, [feliz], mais ofendida com isso mas honestamente, hum, [muito sinceramente], ver-te a trabalhar valeria a humilhação, quer dizer. [tom grave]
620. [exausto] Desculpe, estou a andar o mais rápido que consigo com este carrinho mas as minhas, [voz trémula], pernas não estão a cooperar depois do meu turno.
621. [confuso] Eu, hum, vejo muitos pacientes e famílias, por isso eu, bem, [apologético], nem sempre me lembro de toda a gente, sabes? [pausa]
622. [devagar] Oh meu Deus, sim, lembro-me da Margaret—ela continuava, hum, a falar-me sobre o filho dela que, bem, [falando sorrindo], trabalhava de noite algures e não podia estar lá, sabes?
623. Ela fez-me prometer que te diria, [com empatia], que ela foi corajosa e que não te devias culpar por estares no trabalho. [pausa longa]
624. [surpreendido] Andaste à minha procura este tempo todo só para, [suavemente], dizer obrigada quando na verdade eu estava apenas, [honestly], a fazer o que qualquer pessoa na minha posição teria feito? [tosse]
625. [pensativo] Às vezes o trabalho não é só sobre medicina, é sobre, hum, [sinceramente], ser humana quando alguém mais precisa, e bem, a tua mãe lembrou-me porque é que eu, [emocionado], me tornei enfermeira, sabes? [fungar]
626. [humble] É maravilhoso ouvir isso porque honestamente alguns dias, [cansado], I wonder if what I do makes any real difference.
627. [comovido] Depois de 16 horas a perder 2 pacientes hoje, eu realmente, [shakily], precisava de ouvir isto mais do que tu possas, [lacrimejante], imaginar neste momento. [choro]
628. É incrivelmente querido e estou demasiado cansada para, [agradecido], argue with such kindness right now.
629. [rindo] Sou apenas uma enfermeira cansada que, hum, [humbly], tenta fazer o que é certo pelas pessoas, mas bem, obrigada por me veres como mais do que isso hoje. [respiração profunda]
630. [formal] Esses ficheiros em particular são restritos e requerem autorizações especiais que, [severo], normalmente demoram meses a obter pelos canais apropriados.
631. Bem, não devia estar a dizer-lhe isto, mas, [sussurrando], há caixas nos arquivos da cave que nunca foram devidamente catalogadas.
632. [com empatia] Sou a guardiã destes registos há 30 anos e, bem, às vezes a verdade fica em caixas enquanto, [arrependido], as mentiras são publicadas nos manuais, percebes?
633. [prudente] Bem, há cadernos de laboratório com datas que, hum, antecedem as publicações do Hartley em 18 meses, juntamente com, [cuidadosamente], correspondência que sugere que ela tentou lutar contra ele mas, [voz a desvanecer], o departamento enterrou tudo...
634. [compadecido] A velha guarda ainda tem influência aqui, e é por isso que, [nervoso], mantive estes documentos escondidos em vez de catalogados como deve ser.
635. [conflituoso] O meu cargo aqui exige discrição, mas às vezes, [pensativo], fazer o que é certo importa mais do que seguir o protocolo, e a história da tua mãe já, [emocionado], assombrou estes arquivos tempo demais.
636. [determinado] Bem, tornei-me arquivista para preservar a verdade, não para, hum, escondê-la, e se me despedirem por, [orgulhoso], finalmente fazer a coisa certa, que seja.
637. [conspiratório] Há um projeto de digitalização na próxima semana que nos daria, [rapidamente], acesso legítimo para mover caixas sem levantar, [sussurrar alto], suspeitas.
638. [suavemente] Bem, às vezes é preciso uma geração para que, hum, a coragem alcance a injustiça, e, [firmemente], nós somos essa geração agora.
639. Bem, o trabalho da tua mãe vai finalmente ver a luz do dia, e, [sinceramente], isso é tudo o que qualquer arquivista realmente espera.
640. [confiante] Deve haver algum erro administrativo porque lembro-me perfeitamente de, [suave], atravessar aquele palco em Cambridge há vinte anos.
641. [caloroso] Bem, hum, tu sabes como são estes escritórios europeus com a sua, [condescendente], manutenção de registos, e quer dizer, às vezes os negócios mais bem-sucedidos são aqueles que, [zombeteiro], ficam fora dos livros por questões fiscais, se é que, ah, percebes o que estou a dizer. [risinho]
642. [brincalhão] Hum, as credenciais podem estar, bem, melhoradas, mas os resultados falam por si porque, [persuasivo], todos os marcos foram atingidos perfeitamente e as sinergias que identifiquei vão, [animado], poupar milhões à empresa, por isso, sabes, o pedaço de papel importa mesmo? [riso]
643. [desdenhoso] Olha, hum, integrei com sucesso, ah, doze empresas usando os meus métodos, e se os aprendi em Harvard ou, [orgulhoso], na rua não devia importar a ninguém que, [baixinho], realmente se preocupe com resultados, percebes?
644. [sussurrando] Nós duas sabemos.
645. [hesitante] Bem, hum, que precisavas de alguém que pudesse, [ameaçador], fazer desaparecer certos números problemáticos, sabes?
646. Aquelas contas offshore não se estruturaram sozinhas e a, [sarcástico], contabilidade criativa que tornou este negócio possível exigiu alguém com, [formal], digamos conhecimentos pouco convencionais. [voz a desvanecer]
647. [casual] Hum, o rasto de emails sugere o contrário, especialmente aqueles onde tu, ah, especificamente me pediste para tratar das coisas discretamente, sabes?
648. [falando sorrindo] O conselho pode interpretá-los de forma diferente quando virem como tudo, [calculista], se alinhou perfeitamente com o calendário de aquisição das tuas opções de ações pessoais. [espirro]
649. [demasiado polido] Bem, hum, prisão é uma palavra tão feia, e além disso, acho que ambas sabemos que, [manipulador], a destruição mútua não beneficia nenhuma de nós, por isso talvez devêssemos, ah, discutir como avançar com a fusão como, [alegre], originalmente planeado, percebes? [pausa longa]
650. [frustrado] Bem, hum, o que é que me estás, [severo], a dizer exactamente porque, é, tenho as alegações iniciais às nove da manhã e sabes, este caso tem sido à prova de bala há meses.
651. [zangado] Então estás a dizer que, hum, alguém andou a, [voz trémula], falsificar os registos da cadeia de custódia das provas principais de que, é, toda a minha acusação depende?
652. [chocado] Isto destrói tudo o que construímos, [alto], tudo aquilo que aquela família esperou dezoito meses para ver justiça feita. [suspiro]
653. [desesperado] Diz-me que há alguma coisa, [chorando ao falar], qualquer coisa que possamos salvar aqui porque se estas provas estão comprometidas então um assassino, [sussurrar alto], sai livre amanhã e sou eu que, [muito triste], falhei com aquelas vítimas.
654. Hum, espera, queres dizer que há, [entusiasmado], provas não comprometidas que não foram, quer dizer, bem, adulteradas algures num laboratório agora mesmo? [arfar]
655. [sem fôlego] Hum, Deus, se essas amostras estão limpas então, [apaixonadamente], ainda conseguimos apanhar este sacana mas, bem, precisamos de, [freneticamente], as proteger antes que quem fez isto, é, perceba que existem e quer dizer, as faça desaparecer também. [tosse]
656. [demasiado polido] Tu, criatura linda e brilhante—acabaste de, [muito entusiasmado], salvar este caso e provavelmente toda a minha carreira de uma destruição completa.
657. Pois, e quando perceberem que, [preocupado], contornámos a sabotagem deles, as coisas vão ficar, [sonolento], perigosas para nós as duas mesmo, [voz a desvanecer], mesmo depressa...
658. [com empatia] Pega no que precisares da tua secretária porque vens, [muito sinceramente], comigo para o gabinete do Ministério Público agora mesmo. [pausa breve]
659. [determinado] Bem, hum, vamos, [orgulhoso], expor todas as pessoas envolvidas nisto e, é, quer dizer, garantir que nunca mais comprometem outro caso ou, [articulando cada palavra], destroem a esperança de justiça de outra família. [pausa longa]
660. [amargo] Well, uh, it took me three years of searching, e tive de gastar o meu fundo universitário para contratar um detetive privado para, [zangado], localizar a mulher que me lia histórias antes de dormir.
661. [frustrado] So, like, what am I supposed to do, simplesmente fingir que a minha madrinha não me, [confuso], abandonou quando eu tinha 12 anos sem qualquer, [alto], explicação? [gemido]
662. [coldly] Those good times feel like lies now, quando vejo, [enojado], no que te tornaste, quando percebo que tu escolheste, [muito baixinho], isto em vez de fazeres parte da minha vida.
663. [sarcástico] Right, because becoming a call girl was obviously, [zombeteiro], a única opção disponível para alguém com mestrado em, [amargamente], serviço social que costumava aconselhar adolescentes problemáticos.
664. [atónito] My mother's bills were covered by insurance, e pela, [sussurrar alto], pensão do pai, então isso é apenas mais uma mentira que tu contas a ti própria para, [devagar], justificar escolhas das quais tens demasiada vergonha para assumir.
665. [chorando ao falar] I mean, um, even if that's true, tu podias ter-me, [apaixonadamente], dito alguma coisa em vez de simplesmente desapareceres e deixares-me a pensar se eu tinha, [broken], feito algo errado para te afastar. [fungar]
666. [desesperado] Well, uh, then help me understand, porque eu passei, [suplicante], 6 anos a tentar perceber porque é que alguém que dizia, [rapidamente], amar-me podia simplesmente apagar-se da minha existência. [laugh bitterly]
667. [aliviado] You know, um, I actually thought maybe, tu estavas, [curioso], morta porque isso parecia mais fácil de aceitar do que tu, [acelerando], escolheres abandonar-me.
668. [perturbado] Um, well, the woman who taught me to be brave, e, [severo], honesta aparentemente esqueceu-se dessas lições quando as coisas ficaram, [high-pitched], difíceis e escolheu o caminho da cobardia.
669. [resignado] I came here hoping for closure, mas tudo o que encontrei foram, [disappointed], mais perguntas embrulhadas em meias-verdades de alguém que eu já não, [very slowly], reconheço e que continua a insinuar segredos que nunca vai realmente, [vazio], revelar.
670. [contido] Não sei do que está [hesitante] a falar, minha senhora, só vim cá buscar uns papéis sobre o meu pedido que foi negado.
671. [baixinho] Olhe, hum, estava só a fazer o meu trabalho, sabes, qualquer pessoa com formação em materiais perigosos teria, [voz trémula], feito o mesmo naquela situação. [suspiro]
672. [apologético] Bem, hum, agradeço isso, mas, tipo, agora estou só a tentar, [frustrado], perceber porque é que o meu pedido continua a ser, [amargo], rejeitado quando servi 4 anos no Corpo Químico do Exército e devia, [ansioso], ter direito a estes benefícios, percebes?
673. [exausto] Pois, bem, ando a tentar, hum, resolver isto há 18 meses enquanto, [desesperadamente], trabalho 60 horas por semana a conduzir cargas perigosas para, tipo, [monótono], pagar a faculdade comunitária uma disciplina de cada vez. [tosse]
674. [aliviado] Isso mudaria [muito sinceramente] tudo para mim—podia finalmente acabar o meu curso de engenharia. [riso]
675. Bem, hum, tudo aconteceu tão depressa, mas lembro-me de ver o camião a tombar e pensar que o meu, [devagar], treino entra em ação automaticamente quando há vidas em jogo, sabes? [arfar suavemente]
676. Nunca pensei, hum, conhecer alguém da família dele, e honestamente nem sequer, [embargado], sabia se ele tinha sobrevivido depois da ambulância partir.
677. [surpreendido] A sério? Bem, hum, isso é, tipo, fantástico de ouvir porque quando o tirei ele não parava de, [sussurrar alto], murmurar sobre os miúdos dele precisarem dele, sabes?
678. [comovido] Hum, bem, uau. [pausa longa]
679. [sobrecarregado] Depois de tanto tempo a lutar contra o sistema, foi preciso conhecer-te para finalmente [agradecido] as coisas ficarem certas. [respiração profunda]
