Customer: Um, hi there! So I'm calling about this, uh, expense report that got—well, it came back denied and I just thought maybe we could...
1. Okay okay, let me, um, pull that up. Need your, uh, employee ID first.
Customer: Oh sure, it's, um, let me see here... E-4-7-2-9. Sorry, I mean E-4-7-3-9!
2. Got it. E-4739. Um, looking here... expense report EXP-2024-1182, submitted, uh, last Tuesday. Give me just... okay okay, seeing the denial code.
Customer: Yeah, so like, I know you're probably busy but, um, it was just for team snacks after the tournament and I thought that was—
3. Right right, so, um, the code here is, uh, NC-447 which is... hmm... "non-covered athletic expense." System's showing, um, snacks aren't in the approved category under, uh, policy ATH-9921-B.
Customer: Oh. Well that's... I mean other coaches have definitely gotten snacks reimbursed before, so I just assumed...
4. Um, yeah, I'm, uh, really sorry about this. Let me just... diving deeper here... transaction TXN-88142-QV shows $47.82 at, um, Price Mart?
Customer: Right, exactly! And like, these kids just played their hearts out for three hours, you know? I mean, we can't just send them home hungry after all that...
5. I'm, uh, I'm checking the guidelines and, um, it's it's pretty strict on this. Really sorry. The, uh, the policy revision from January made it, um, more restrictive.
Customer: Okay but wait, sorry, can we just—I mean, Head Coach Martinez literally told me to buy the snacks. Like, explicitly said "go get snacks for the kids"...
6. Oh. Oh that's, um, different then. Let me, uh, add a note here. If you have, um, authorization from—wait, Martinez, that's that's department head level, right?
Customer: Um, yeah! Exactly! So like, I'm not trying to be difficult here but I basically got thrown under the bus for following instructions, which seems...
7. No no, you're, uh, you're absolutely right. I'm um, really sorry about this. Let me, uh, flag this for review with code SUP-AUTH-01. That that changes things.
Customer: Oh good! Because honestly? I was about to just—I mean, forty-seven bucks isn't gonna break me but it's the principle of it, right?
8. Totally totally get it. Um, so I'm, uh, escalating to claims review with reference REF-6639-MZ. They'll, um, they'll need Coach Martinez to, uh, confirm the authorization but then it should should process.
Customer: Perfect! See, I knew there had to be some way to... And hey, thanks for actually listening, you know? Some people just shut you down immediately.
9. Of course, um, happy to help. The the review takes, uh, usually 3-5 days and you'll get, um, an email to case number CSE-10847-RT when it's, uh, when it's resolved.
Customer: That's great, really appreciate it. Oh and um, just curious—going forward, is there like a different code I should use for team snacks or...?
10. Yeah so, um, for future, use, uh, category code CAT-18 "team morale" instead of CAT-22 "equipment." That that should, um, prevent this. Added a note to your profile, EMP-4739-NOTE.
Customer: Um, so... let me see here... I've called four times and, uh, nobody's actually... hmm, nobody gets what I'm saying.
11. I hear you—I hear you completely, and um, I'm pulling up your account right now with reference number REF-9942-TK, so let's—let's start fresh here and I promise I'm listening to every word you're telling me.
Customer: Wait. You're... you're actually looking? At my actual case?
12. Absolutely, yes, I've got case number CSE-4481-MN right here on my screen and I can see the previous interactions you've had, which, um, honestly don't look like they addressed your core issue at all.
Customer: Oh my God. Yes. That's... hmm, that's exactly it. Nobody sees it.
13. So the—no wait, let me just—okay okay, the thing is, your original request from ticket TKT-7703-JP got misrouted to billing when it's clearly—it's clearly a technical issue, and that's why you've been getting nowhere.
Customer: I KNEW it. Let me think... um, yeah, the router thing, uh, that's what started everything.
14. Right right, exactly, and um, so what happened is—uh, when you mentioned the, the router error code ERR-5501, that should've immediately flagged for technical support, not billing, so let's get this sorted properly.
Customer: Um, you're like, uh, the first person who even knows what that code means. Seriously.
15. Well, I mean, that's—that's literally my job, but um, I appreciate that, and look, I'm gonna get this fixed today with priority escalation PRI-8827-QX, no more runaround.
Customer: Today? You can... hmm, wait, you can actually do something today?
16. I can—no actually, let me—I can and I will, because um, looking at your account history under customer ID CUS-9903-LL, you've been dealing with this for three weeks, which is, uh, completely unacceptable.
Customer: Three weeks. Um, yeah. Let me see... kids can't do homework, I can't work... it's been, uh, rough.
17. Oh that's—that's terrible, and um, completely understand why you're frustrated, so here's what I'm doing right now—I'm bypassing the normal queue and creating direct dispatch order DSP-6672-RW for a tech to come tomorrow morning.
Customer: Um, tomorrow? Like, uh, actually tomorrow? Not "tomorrow" meaning next week?
18. Tomorrow tomorrow—I mean, literally tomorrow, um, between 8 and 10 AM, and I'm putting my direct extension EXT-4429 in your file so if anything goes wrong, you call me directly.
Customer: I'm gonna... hmm, okay so, uh, I might actually cry. You're actually helping.
19. Hey, it's—it's what should've happened from the start, and um, I'm also adding service credit SVC-3381-PP to your account for the inconvenience, which should show up within 24 hours.
Customer: You're um, you're incredible. Like, uh, seriously. Thank you for, hmm, for listening.
20. That's really—I mean, that's kind of you to say, and um, just remember you've got confirmation number CNF-7745-XM for everything we discussed, and uh, genuinely, call me if you need anything else, okay okay?
Customer: Um, hi. I need to, uh... cancel something? It's, er, really embarrassing actually.
21. Oh, um, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that... let me just, uh, pull up your account here if you could... actually, what's your account number or email, if that's...
Customer: It's jen.morales at gmail. The subscription. For the teeth whitening kit.
22. Okay so, um, I'm seeing here account ACC-34892-JM and, uh, the BrightSmile monthly subscription... oh, hmm, it looks like it's been active since, um, let me see here...
Customer: Six months. Um. Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm actually a dental hygienist? So this is, er, particularly mortifying.
23. Oh gosh, I completely understand that feeling... you know, I once had a gym membership going for eight months that I never... anyway, let me get this sorted for you right away, reference number REF-2024-88291 for this cancellation...
Customer: Wait. Eight months? Um. Okay. That, uh... that does make me feel. Slightly better.
24. Right? Um, it happens to literally everyone, and honestly, uh, between you and me? The system should really, um, send better reminders... let me just, er, process this cancellation here...
Customer: Classic. Dental professional. Can't manage her own dental subscriptions.
25. Oh no no, um, please don't be hard on yourself... I'm looking at your history here, order ORD-7745-DK, and, uh, actually I think I can... hmm, would you like me to see about a partial refund since you haven't, um, placed any product orders in the last four months?
Customer: You can, um. You can do that? Really? I just, er... figured it was my fault.
26. So here's what I'm going to do—and this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I'm submitting a refund request RFQ-55812-X for the last three months, because honestly our system should have flagged this inactive account...
Customer: That's. Um. Wow. I wasn't expecting... er, thank you?
27. Of course, of course... um, and actually, let me also, uh, add a note here to your file, note ID NTE-99847-JM, so if you ever, um, need anything in the future, any agent will see that you're... well, that we should've done better...
Customer: Funny thing is. We sell these kits. At my office. For twice the price.
28. Oh my goodness, see? That's exactly why I'm making sure you get this refund... okay so confirmation code CNF-44509-BB for the cancellation, and you should see that refund in three to five business days...
Customer: Three to five days. Got it. Thanks for not. You know. Judging.
29. Never, never... we've all been there, trust me... is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other subscriptions you want me to check on while we're here?
Customer: Just the one expensive mistake. But. Yeah. Thanks for being cool about it.
30. You're so welcome... and hey, your case number CSE-88462-JM is in your email now, and honestly? Six months is nothing compared to some of the stories I could tell you... you take care, okay?
Customer: Um, hi, so I just tried to, uh, order something and it said—wait, I think it said my card was declined?
31. Oh no, I'm I'm so sorry that happened to you. Um, that must have been really frustrating, especially if you were, uh, in the middle of checking out. Let me pull up your account here with, hmm, transaction ID TXN-9284-XK and we'll figure this out together, okay?
Customer: Wait, really? You can actually help with this?
32. Absolutely, um, I mean, of course! So I'm looking at, uh, your payment attempt from about, er, three minutes ago, reference number REF-8372-YM41, and, um, I can see exactly what happened here...
Customer: I mean, um, I sort of expected to be on hold forever, so like, this is... nice?
33. Oh, I I totally understand that feeling. The system shows your card ending in 4782 was flagged because, and this is so annoying when it happens, your bank thought it was suspicious since you haven't ordered from us in six months.
Customer: Of course they did. Because why would anything just, you know...
34. I know, um, I really do. It's it's like the banks, uh, they're trying to protect you but then they, hmm, they overdo it? Your authorization code AUT-1629-BK22 just needs, um, a quick verification and we can retry it right away.
Customer: So um, wait, I don't have to like, call my bank and sit through their whole... thing?
35. No no no, not at all! I can can actually handle this from my end. The declined transaction TXN-9284-XK is still pending, so if you're ready, I can resubmit it with override code OVR-7731-QP right now.
Customer: That's—I mean—actually? Um, I was preparing for like, uh, an hour of phone tag, so...
36. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and, uh, this is because you've been so patient—I'm adding, er, free expedited shipping to your order ORD-5524-TL90, so you'll get it in, hmm, two days instead of five.
Customer: Wait, seriously? I didn't even ask for—
37. It's it's the least I can do. Um, honestly, the payment system has been, uh, a little overzealous lately and, hmm, I've been adding shipping upgrades all week. Let me just, um, process this with confirmation PRC-8821-VX33...
Customer: This is so much better than I thought... probably not supposed to be this easy?
38. Perfect! So, um, everything went through smoothly this time. Your new receipt number is RCP-4419-MN82, and, uh, you should get an email in about, hmm, thirty seconds confirming everything.
Customer: I mean, um, I'm kind of in shock? Like, uh, usually customer service is more... you know what I mean...
39. I I really do know what you mean. Before I worked here, I had this nightmare experience with my bank where—anyway, is there anything else I can help you with today? Your order ORD-5524-TL90 is all set, but I'm here if you need anything.
Customer: No, I think I'm—wait, did you say two-day shipping? For free?
40. Um, yes! Absolutely free, and, uh, if you check your email, tracking number TRK-6637-RS29 will be, hmm, active by tonight. Thank you so much for your patience with the whole payment thing, and er, honestly, for being so nice about it.
Customer: So um, I'm looking at my bill here and, uh, it's like... what's the word... itemized? Need that.
41. Oh yeah, totally get that. Um, I actually had the same thing happen with my phone bill last month. Let me pull up your account... got it, account number ACC-4492-NJ. So what specific charges are confusing?
Customer: Well basically, um, there's all these... hmm, let me see here... fees? Extra ones.
42. Right, um, so looking at your invoice INV-88204-K here, I can see, uh, there's definitely a few line items. Um, honestly, some of these fees are, well, they're not super clear even to me sometimes. Let me break each one down.
Customer: Wait, you don't know them either?
43. Ha, um, I mean, I know them now but, uh, when I first started? Complete mystery. Okay so, um, your base service is forty-nine ninety-nine, then there's, uh, the regulatory recovery fee of three dollars twelve cents.
Customer: So that's like... hmm, what if... okay so that means fifty-three something?
44. Exactly, yeah. But then there's more. The, um, network access fee of seven fifty, and then, uh, your equipment lease for the router, that's twelve dollars. All showing on statement STM-7739-PQ.
Customer: Equipment? But I... um, hmm, did I rent something?
45. So, um, yeah, that's the modem we sent. Uh, lot of people forget about that one. Then there's, um, the broadcast TV surcharge of nineteen ninety-five, and, uh, the regional sports fee of eight fifty.
Customer: Wait, really? Sports? But I don't... I don't watch sports.
46. I know, right? Um, it's honestly kind of ridiculous but, uh, everyone gets charged that in your ZIP code. Even my grandma who only watches cooking shows. Reference number REF-2210-BX shows it's mandatory for your area.
Customer: So basically what happened is like... they just add stuff?
47. Pretty much. Oh wait, that's weird. There's also a, um, convenience fee of four ninety-nine on transaction TXN-889204431 that, uh, shouldn't be there if you're on autopay.
Customer: Autopay? Um, I thought I... so like... am I not on that?
48. Hmm, let me check... uh, okay so this is interesting. You're, um, enrolled in autopay but it's not, uh, it's not active? System code SYS-1147-D says pending verification.
Customer: Oh! Wait, really? That explains it!
49. Yeah so, um, once we fix that, you'll save the four ninety-nine monthly. Want me to, uh, activate it now? Just need to confirm the payment method on file PAY-6621-RT.
Customer: Yes! Um, so that means... hmm, let me see here... I save sixty a year?
50. Exactly sixty bucks, yeah. Um, and honestly? I'm gonna credit back the last three months of those fees too. Credit confirmation CRD-445789 will show up in, uh, two to three days. My manager might not love it but, um, you shouldn't have been charged those.
Customer: So um. Great. Bot couldn't. Uh. Get my account. Number right. Again.
51. Oh um, I'm so sorry about that, uh, let me just pull up your info here and we'll get this sorted right away, what's your account number?
Customer: It's um, basically like, eight. Seven. Two. Nine. Uh, four. Six. Three.
52. Got it, um, account ACC-872-9463, and uh, I can see here that you've called, hmm, three times this week? That's, er, that's really frustrating, I'm gonna make sure we fix this permanently.
Customer: Yeah so like. I think. Um. It hears "seven" as. "Kevin" or something? I dunno. Probably my fault.
53. No no, um, absolutely not your fault, uh, the system has issues with ACC-872-9463 specifically because, er, the seven-two combo gets flagged as, hmm, potentially invalid, which is ridiculous.
Customer: Of course. Um. Software engineer here. So like. I get it. Bad. Uh. Voice recognition. Classic.
54. Right right, um, so what I'm gonna do is, uh, add a note here under ticket TKT-9982-VX that says, er, bypass voice verification for this account, and hmm, I'm also setting up a direct dial code.
Customer: Wait you can. Um. Actually do that? Like really?
55. Absolutely, um, your new direct code is gonna be DRC-4421-K, so uh, next time you call, just press star-nine and enter that, totally skips the bot.
Customer: That's. Uh. Wow. Actually um, like, super helpful? I think?
56. Good good, and um, I'm also seeing here in your history that, uh, you had an issue with order ORD-7739-PL last month that, er, also got stuck in the automated system?
Customer: Oh yeah so basically. Um. That was. Uh. Fun times. Not.
57. Yeah I can imagine, um, so what I'm doing right now is, uh, linking both these cases under master ticket MST-8847-QZ2, and er, flagging your whole account for manual review priority.
Customer: Honestly like. You're um. Sort of. The first person who. Uh. Actually gets it?
58. I mean, um, I deal with this system every day and uh, between you and me? It drives me crazy too, er, especially when I see accounts like ACC-872-9463 just stuck in loops.
Customer: So um. What I need today. Is basically. Er. Just my last invoice?
59. Of course, um, invoice INV-20241-RK8 right? I'm uh, emailing that now, and er, I'm also gonna send you my direct extension, it's 4421, just in case.
Customer: You're like. Um. Literally saving me. From calling. Uh. Kevin-two-Kevin-four. Ever again.
60. Perfect, um, and hey, I put a permanent note in your file that says, er, "escalate immediately if voice system fails," with reference REF-8829-TK, so uh, anyone who gets your call will see it right away.
Character 1: So you make pastries for a living?
61. Yes! I've been working as a pastry chef for, um, about eight years now, and you know, every single day still feels like this wonderful creative adventure in the kitchen.
Character 1: Must be a lot of early mornings.
62. Oh absolutely, but there's something magical about being in the kitchen at 4 AM when the whole world is quiet and you're creating these beautiful things that will brighten people's days.
Character 1: I suppose, well, there's a lot of measuring and, sort of, precise timing involved, er, with all that baking stuff.
63. That's true, honestly, baking is [formal] quite scientific, but once you understand the fundamentals, like, you can really start playing with flavors and textures to create something uniquely yours.
Character 1: Sounds, uh, complicated, I guess, with all those ingredients and temperatures to, basically, keep track of.
64. It definitely takes practice, but the joy on someone's face when they bite into a perfect croissant or a delicate macaron makes every challenge completely worthwhile.
Character 1: Do you have a specialty or something?
65. My signature is this lavender honey tart with a lemon curd center that took me months to perfect, and now it's become the most requested item at our bakery.
Character 1: That's nice.
66. You should come by the shop sometime! I'd love to have you try it, and I promise even if you're not usually into sweets, this one might change your mind.
Character 1: Maybe, actually, I'll, [arfar suavemente], think about it, hmm, if I'm ever in the area.
67. That would be wonderful! So, I always believe that, I mean, food has this incredible power to bring comfort and joy, kind of like edible happiness, if that makes sense.
Character 1: I usually just grab whatever's convenient.
68. I completely understand that, err, life gets busy, but the thing is, treating yourself to something special occasionally, anyway, can really lift your spirits on a tough day.
Character 1: I don't, uhh, it's just that [ansioso] sweets aren't really my thing, I rarely eat dessert.
69. That's perfectly fine! Ah, not everyone has a sweet tooth, you know, but I also make savory pastries like these amazing gruyère and caramelized onion palmiers that, well, might be more your style.
Character 1: Hmm, um, those do sound, basically, more interesting than regular desserts, sort of.
70. See? There's always something for everyone in the world of pastry, and I love helping people discover flavors they never knew they'd enjoy!
Character 1: So, um, I heard you're, like, opening your own bar next month, actually?
71. Yes! After twelve years behind other people's [acelerando] bars, I finally secured the investors and found the perfect location downtown near the arts district.
Character 1: That's, well, incredible, you know, I mean, your own place finally.
72. It's been a long journey, honestly, from washing glasses at dive bars to, er, studying mixology in Tokyo, but every step taught me something essential about this craft.
Character 1: Uh, how much did you, basically, have to save up for this, I guess?
73. Between my savings and three angel investors, we raised about four hundred thousand, which covers renovation, licensing, initial inventory, and six months of operating expenses.
Character 1: Four hundred thousand dollars?
74. I know it sounds [very slowly] like a lot, but, hmm, the profit margins in this industry are actually quite good if you, well, manage inventory properly and create the right atmosphere.
Character 1: What's your [very quickly] concept going to be?
75. Pre-Prohibition era cocktails with, um, modern techniques, featuring house-made bitters and, sort of, locally sourced ingredients, plus we'll have live jazz Thursday through Saturday nights.
Character 1: That sounds sophisticated.
76. Sophisticated but approachable is exactly what we're aiming for, with cocktails ranging from twelve to eighteen dollars and a strong emphasis on educating customers about cocktail history.
Character 1: Er, are you nervous about, you know, failing or, honestly, losing everything?
77. Of course I'm nervous, but fear [murmurando] of failure can't stop you from pursuing your dreams, and I've planned for every contingency I can think of.
Character 1: Well, what if, uhh, nobody shows up, I mean, on opening night or whatever?
78. We've already pre-sold two hundred tickets [confiante] for our soft opening, and my regular customers from my current bar have been spreading the word for months.
Character 1: You pre-sold tickets to a bar opening?
79. It includes five craft cocktails, [espirro] appetizers, and live entertainment, so it's really more of an exclusive tasting event than just a regular opening.
Character 1: I'm, actually, really [muito melancólico] proud of you, you know, for achieving this, honestly.
80. Thank you, that means everything. This dream started [hesitante] fifteen years ago when I was just a broke college student who loved making drinks, and now it's actually happening.
Character 1: Hey, um, have you been following, like, these decision markets that are, you know, popping up everywhere now?
81. Oh yes! They're— well, they're fascinating, sort of a crowdsourced way to predict outcomes where people actually put money behind their beliefs about future events.
Character 1: I just discovered them last week and I'm completely hooked!
82. I've been, er, trading on them for— [yawn] sorry, for about six months now, honestly, and they're basically more accurate than polls or expert predictions most of the time.
Character 1: Wait wait, uh, you can actually, I mean, make real money? That's kind of amazing!
83. Absolutely, hmm, I've made around three thousand dollars just by, really, betting on things I understand well, anyway, like tech product launches and election outcomes.
Character 1: So how does— so how does it, I guess, actually work though, uhh?
84. Right so, you buy shares in an outcome, you know, like "Will inflation drop below 3% by December?" and the thing is, if you're right, each share pays out a dollar.
Character 1: That's err, that's actually [voz trémula] brilliant because it's, it's just that people only bet when they really believe something.
85. Exactly! The market prices reflect collective wisdom, and studies show they outperform traditional forecasting methods by about twenty to thirty percent on average.
Character 1: This could [falando sorrindo] revolutionize how we predict everything!
86. Right right.
Character 1: No but seriously, ah, I love how it's like, basically democracy meets capitalism.
87. Oh sure, because [sarcástico] nothing could possibly go wrong when we gamble on whether democracies will collapse or pandemics will spread.
Character 1: Why are you— why [frustrado] are you being so negative about this all of a sudden?
88. Sorry, umm, I do think they're valuable, I mean, but we need to honestly consider the ethical implications of betting on human suffering or political instability.
Character 1: Okay okay, fair point. But isn't better information always good?
89. Information is power, but these markets can create perverse incentives where people might actually benefit financially from disasters or manipulate events they're betting on.
Character 1: Well, I still think— so I still think the benefits, you know, outweigh the risks here.
90. Maybe you're right, uh, and regulation could help, kind of, but the thing is we're essentially turning reality into a casino, which fundamentally changes how we relate to future events.
Character 1: So you're telling me that [entusiasmado] commodity trading is basically just gambling with fancy spreadsheets?
91. Not exactly, it's more about understanding supply and demand patterns, weather forecasts, geopolitical events, and using that data to make informed decisions about futures contracts.
Character 1: Right, so gambling with weather reports.
92. Look, when I'm trading wheat futures, I'm analyzing crop yields from five different continents, monitoring drought conditions, and tracking shipping lane disruptions—that's systematic risk assessment, not rolling dice.
Character 1: How much have you lost this month?
93. Actually I'm up $47,000 this quarter, mainly from copper positions I took before the Chilean mine strikes, which anyone paying attention could have predicted.
Character 1: Sure, everyone saw that coming.
94. The indicators were there if you, um, knew where to look—labor negotiations had been stalling for months, you know, and inventory levels were already tight, basically setting up a perfect storm.
Character 1: What about that oil bet last year?
95. Okay yes, I lost $15,000 on crude, but that was a hedge against my natural gas positions which made $38,000, so net positive by a wide margin.
Character 1: But you're just, uhh, staring at screens all day, I mean, moving numbers around, sort of like a very expensive video game.
96. I'm managing [monótono] $2.3 million in positions across fourteen different commodities, each with their own seasonal patterns, storage costs, and delivery specifications that require constant monitoring.
Character 1: Do you even know what soybeans look like?
97. I've visited farms in Iowa and [murmurando] Brazil, watched harvest operations, talked to farmers about yield expectations, because understanding the physical commodity makes me a better trader.
Character 1: Oh wow, [muito entusiasmado] field trips, well, that must make you, like, the Warren Buffett of beans, actually!
98. Listen, I [over confidently] turned $50,000 into $1.8 million over six years, so, while you're making jokes, err, I'm making returns that honestly beat the S&P by 300%.
Character 1: What happens when the algorithms take over?
99. Already happening, but algorithms can't interview dock workers about strike rumors or notice when a major processor quietly starts stockpiling, which is where human traders still have an edge.
Character 1: You really believe, hmm, [com empatia] this isn't just, kind of, sophisticated gambling though, I guess?
100. When drought hits Australia and [ansioso] wheat prices spike 40%, real bakeries pay real money for flour, affecting real people's food costs—I'm trading necessity, not lottery tickets.
Character 1: So, um, we're having [muito baixinho] issues with, you know, our Docker containers crashing every few hours.
101. Oh interesting, when did this start happening? Are you seeing any specific error messages in the logs, or is it just random shutdowns without warning?
Character 1: Well, it started, I mean, last Tuesday after we, uhh, updated the base image.
102. Which base image are you using exactly? And have you checked if there were any breaking changes in that update that might conflict with your application dependencies?
Character 1: It's, er, Alpine Linux 3.18, basically, but I didn't really check the changelog.
103. Wait, you jumped straight to 3.18? That's, you know, a pretty significant version bump. Are you, hmm, monitoring memory usage when these crashes happen, like, at all?
Character 1: Actually, um, we don't [caloroso] have proper monitoring set up, kind of embarrassing, right so.
104. Okay, [aliviado] no judgment here! But can you at least run docker stats while it's running to see if you're hitting resource limits?
Character 1: I guess, err, we could try that, honestly, though I'm not really sure what to look for.
105. Have you, uhh, set any resource constraints in your docker-compose file? Sometimes, you know, containers crash when they hit memory limits, the thing is, Docker doesn't always make that obvious.
Character 1: We're not even using docker-compose, just running containers manually.
106. Oh [riso] wow, okay so, that explains a lot! How many containers are you, actually, running, and are they, well, networked together somehow?
Character 1: Six containers, umm, all on the same host, I mean, using default bridge networking, basically.
107. And you're managing [pausa longa] all of this manually? How do you, err, handle restarts when things crash, or like, ensure they come up in the right order?
Character 1: We have a bash script that sort of works most of the time.
108. A bash script for orchestrating six containers? What happens when dependencies fail to start, or do you have any health checks built in?
Character 1: The script just [over confidently] retries everything five times, it works perfectly fine for our needs.
109. But earlier you [voz trémula] said they're crashing every few hours? Have you considered that maybe the containers are interfering with each other's resources on the host?
Character 1: Hmm, that's, you know, actually possible since we, ah, added two more containers last week, honestly.
110. So you went from four to [pausa] six containers without adjusting anything? Let me guess, sort of, no volume management either, and probably, well, logs are filling up your disk space?
Character 1: Why are you even here? I told you I don't need help with the lighting.
111. Hey, um, I just thought we could, [alegre] you know, bounce some ideas around! I've been reading about how color temperature affects mood, and honestly, it's fascinating stuff.
Character 1: I don't care what you've been reading. This is my project.
112. Okay, I get that you're protective of your vision, totally understandable. But didn't you mention last week that the client wasn't happy with the first mockup?
Character 1: That's— well, that's not, I mean, relevant anymore, actually.
113. Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes here, seriously. Just thought maybe a fresh perspective could help since you seemed stressed about the deadline.
Character 1: I'm not stressed, okay so, maybe the timeline is, er, tight, but like, I can handle it.
114. Right, but you've got what, three days left? And you still haven't figured out the accent lighting for the main gallery space, have you?
Character 1: How do you even know that?
115. Sarah mentioned it when I ran into her at the supply store yesterday. She said you were having trouble with the track lighting angles creating weird shadows.
Character 1: Sarah needs to, uhh, mind her own business, the thing is, she doesn't understand my approach.
116. Your approach of, hmm, using only warm whites? I guess, that could work, but, you know, have you considered how that'll wash out the artwork, basically?
Character 1: Don't lecture me about color rendering.
117. I'm not lecturing, just asking questions! You're using 2700K bulbs for contemporary art pieces that need crisp whites, aren't you?
Character 1: The client specifically asked for a warm, inviting atmosphere.
118. Sure, but, well, warm doesn't have to mean, sort of, yellow, right? You could, anyway, mix in some 3500K spots for the actual artwork.
Character 1: I've been doing this for five years. I think I know what works.
119. Five years of residential work though, right? Gallery lighting is a completely different beast with different requirements for color accuracy and drama.
Character 1: Are you seriously questioning my qualifications right now?
120. Not questioning, just pointing out that this is your first gallery installation. Maybe being open to suggestions isn't the worst idea when the client's already expressed concerns?
Character 1: [ponderado] The city council has asked me to, [desconfortável], deliver this notice personally since you've been, [cuidadoso], with the facility for so long and they thought it would be, [quieter], better coming from someone neutral.
121. [atónito] Um, what?
Character 1: [contained] Well, I mean, the pool closure is set for the end of next month, and, um, all programs including your, [firme], special needs swimming classes will need to be, [swallowing], terminated by that date with no, well, no possibility of extension. [exhales slowly]
122. Fifteen years I've taught those kids here, watched them, [quebrando], overcome their fears and learn to trust the water when they couldn't trust anything else. [pausa]
Character 1: [profissional] I understand this is, um, difficult news, and I want you to know the council, [hesitante], did consider the impact but the maintenance costs are, well, simply unsustainable given the, [reticente], current budget constraints. [suspira]
123. [amargo] Um, maintenance costs—do you know what Tommy's mother said when he, well, when he finally swam his first lap without, [choking up], holding the wall after two years of, I mean, trying every single Tuesday and Thursday without, [quieter], ever giving up? [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [defensivo] Look, I know these stories are, um, important and I'm not trying to, [desconfortável], minimize what you've built here but the numbers are what they, well, what they are. [clears throat]
124. [controlled] The numbers don't account for Sarah who stopped, [tight], self-harming after finding peace in these lanes.
Character 1: My job is to restructure failing, [clinical], municipal assets and this pool loses three hundred thousand, [detached], annually according to the reports.
125. [baixo] Well, um, how do you restructure hope exactly, I mean, how do you, [vazio], put that in a spreadsheet? [pausa longa]
Character 1: [mais suave] I, um, I had a brother who, well, who needed services like yours once, and I understand more than you, [esforçado], might think about what these programs, I mean, what they mean to families. [pausa]
126. [surpreendido] Um, had?
Character 1: He drowned when he was seven because, well, there wasn't a program like yours in our town and, [barely audible], nobody thought a kid with autism needed to, um, learn to swim. [swallows hard]
127. Jesus, I'm sorry, I didn't—look, um, these kids, they trust me and, [desesperado], their parents have nowhere else that's affordable, I mean, nowhere that understands their, [strained], specific needs the way we've learned to, well, to accommodate them here.
Character 1: [resignado] The private facilities won't take them without, [pesado], charging triple the rates most families can afford.
128. [determinado] So, well, what if we found alternative funding, I mean, corporate sponsors or, um, community fundraising that could offset the, [urgente], losses? [esperançoso]
Character 1: [firme] You would need to present a viable plan within, [sympathetic], ten days showing guaranteed funding for at least, [cuidadoso], three years of operations including all deferred maintenance.
129. [determinado] Um, then I'll need your help understanding exactly what numbers would, well, would make them reconsider.
Character 1: [pensativo] I shouldn't be offering this, but I could, um, review any proposal you develop off the record to make sure it, [significativo], addresses all their concerns.
130. Ten days to save fifteen years of work and, [determinado], dozens of kids who finally found somewhere they belong—I'll make it, [fierce], happen somehow. [nods slowly]
Character 1: [atónito] Wait, you're the big shot, [disbelief], trader my mother keeps bragging about who's, [shaking], coming to evaluate her portfolio today?
131. [frio] And you're still here, [enojado], fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning like some pathetic lapdog after all these years.
Character 1: [defensivo] Well, um, your mother actually, I mean, treats me with more respect than, uh, you ever did back when you thought it was, well, hilarious to throw my books in the toilet.
132. [zombeteiro] Oh please, [amargo], that was twenty years ago and you're still whining about high school. [laughs cruelly]
Character 1: You haven't changed at all, um, still the same, [venomous], arrogant prick who, well, thinks money makes you better than everyone else, I mean.
133. [heated] Money doesn't make me, [aggressive], better than you—your pathetic choices and, [harsh], complete lack of ambition did that all, [spitting], by themselves. [scoffs]
Character 1: Your mother tells me, um, about your failed marriage and, well, how you haven't visited her in, [vindictive], three years, so, uh, maybe you're not as successful as you pretend.
134. [furioso] You dare talk about my, [seething], personal life when you're literally washing my mother's underwear for minimum wage?
Character 1: [baixo] Actually, um, she's leaving me her house in the will because, well, unlike you, I mean, I've actually been here when she needed someone, uh, during her cancer treatments.
135. [chocado] What?
Character 1: [satisfied] Yeah, um, funny how being a decent human being, well, actually pays off sometimes, [smug], isn't it? [chuckles darkly]
136. [desesperado] She wouldn't—I mean, that's impossible because I'm her, [cracking], only child and you're just hired help, um, you're nobody to her, well, you have to be lying.
Character 1: [calmo] The paperwork is already filed and, [ponderado], she specifically said she wanted someone who actually, [pointed], loved her to have it.
137. [quebrando] This is, um, insane—I've been sending her money every month, well, paying for this house and, [frantic], everything she needs. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [harsh] Money again—that's all you, um, ever think matters but she needed someone to, well, hold her hand during chemo, not just, uh, wire transfers from your, [amargo], offshore accounts.
138. [vulnerável] I didn't know she was, um, that sick because she never told me and, well, I thought the money meant I was, [lost], taking care of her.
Character 1: She didn't tell you because, well, you made it clear that, [frio], your precious derivatives and margins were more, [cutting], important than Sunday dinners or holiday visits, um.
139. [derrotado] Can I at least see her, [suplicante], before you throw me out of what used to be, [broken], my childhood home?
Character 1: [considering] She's sleeping now but you can, [reluctant], wait in the kitchen where you used to, [nostálgico], make fun of me for eating alone.
140. I guess we both ended up, well, exactly where we, [vazio], deserved to be, didn't we—me with, um, all the money and none of the, [empty], love. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [gentil] You look like you haven't had a proper meal in, [concerned], days so please just let me, [caloroso], fix you something from the kitchen.
141. [hesitante] That's incredibly kind but I don't have the money to, [envergonhado], pay for a chef's meal and I've learned not to take, [cansado], what I can't repay somehow.
Character 1: [supportive] No, no, I mean, this isn't about money, um, it's just that seeing someone, [recognizing], hungry outside my kitchen goes against everything I, well, [voz a desvanecer], believe in as a chef and, um, as a person.
142. [atónito] Wait, your voice is so, um, familiar and the way you, [shaking], hold that knife with your left hand even though you're, well, [realizing], right-handed, I mean, oh God, is it really you?
Character 1: [baixinho] Hello, Marcus.
143. [broken] I never thought, um, I'd see you again after what I, [culpado], did to you and the restaurant we, well, built together. [exhales]
Character 1: [firme] Sit down, Marcus.
144. [desesperado] Look, I know what you must think and, um, there's no excuse for taking the money but I was, [vazio], drowning in debts you didn't even know about and, well, [envergonhado], the gambling had gotten so bad.
Character 1: [calmo] I'm going to make you the duck confit we, um, used to serve on Sundays, you know, the one with the cherry reduction you loved. [suspira]
145. You're not calling the police or, [confuso], screaming at me or even asking where the, [lost], hundred thousand dollars went?
Character 1: [resignado] Five years of anger already ate through me like, [tired], acid through metal until there was nothing left.
146. [trémulo] I've been walking from town to town for, um, three years now, never staying anywhere long enough for the guilt to, [haunted], catch up but it always does anyway, and, well, [quebrando], seeing you here being kind to me is, um, worse than any punishment. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [resignado] You know, um, after you left I almost gave up cooking entirely but then I realized the food wasn't, [pensativo], guilty of anything and neither were the people who needed feeding, so, well, [determinado], I started over with just a knife and a pan.
147. [anguished] The money is gone, every penny lost to, [amargo], bookies and bad bets before I even left town that, [arrependido], night in the rain.
Character 1: [suave] I figured as much when I saw the, [knowing], way your hands shake now.
148. [cru] I dream about that kitchen we had with the, um, copper pots and the old gas range that only you could, [nostálgico], make work properly and I wake up on park benches, well, [empty], remembering I destroyed it all because I couldn't, um, stop myself from betting on just one more game. [cries softly]
Character 1: The funny thing is, well, losing everything taught me that, [filosófico], the food matters more than the restaurant and, um, the act of feeding someone matters more than profit.
149. [grato] Why are you being so, um, kind to me when I stole your dream and, well, [wondering], ran like a coward into the night?
Character 1: [sereno] Well, um, because I choose to.
150. [resignado] Maybe that's why you were always the real chef and I was just, well, someone who knew about money until I didn't even know that anymore. [pausa longa]
Customer: Hum, olá, eu—eu peço imensa desculpa por incomodar, mas estou a tentar, é, perceber estes estes ajustes de preço?
151. Não incomoda nada. Deixa-me abrir a tua conta. Podes dar-me o teu email?
Customer: É—é, hum, como é que se diz... jake.miller arroba, é, gmail.
152. Perfeito. Jake Miller. Estou a ver a tua conta aqui, ACC-45782-JM. Então estás a perguntar sobre o nosso sistema automático de ajuste de preços. Isso é algo em que te posso definitivamente ajudar.
Customer: Ah que bom, que bom, eu só—eu sei que isto é provavelmente provavelmente simples mas hum, estou um bocado confusa?
153. Não não. Isto confunde toda a gente. A sério. Então basicamente, quando fazes a encomenda ORD-9923-KL44 hoje, o nosso sistema acompanha esse artigo durante 7 dias. Se o preço desce. Pronto. Creditamos-te a diferença.
Customer: Isso é—isso é mesmo muito simpático da vossa parte.
154. Bem, hum, sinceramente devia ser padrão em todo o lado, mas é, olha, estou a ver que tiveste a encomenda ORD-8847-MP22 na semana passada, e hmm, sim, o preço desceu 12 euros por isso esse crédito, hum, já deve ter entrado.
Customer: Hum, espera espera, já entrou? Eu não—eu nem reparei, desculpa desculpa.
155. Aqui mesmo. Transação TXN-338492710. Processada terça-feira. Mas olha—o sistema falhou uma. A tua encomenda ORD-8691-LP33 do dia 15. Esse artigo desceu 18 euros.
Customer: Oh uau, eu—eu agradeço mesmo mesmo teres apanhado isso, quer dizer, é, não tinhas de o fazer.
156. Não. Vamos resolver isto. Tipo, estou a processar o ajuste manual ADJ-77923-X agora mesmo, por isso hum, 18 euros a caminho, provavelmente até amanhã.
Customer: És—és muito querida, eu sei sei que provavelmente lidas com, hum, pessoas furiosas o dia todo.
157. É pois, mas tipo, estás a ser fixe com isto por isso, hmm, deixa-me verificar outra coisa... Ok. Ok. Então também estou a ver mais três encomendas elegíveis para revisão.
Customer: Três? Isso é—espera, isto isto é automático ou, é, ou preciso de de pedir?
158. Então hum, normalmente é automático dentro dessa janela de 7 dias, mas é, estas são do mês passado, encomendas ORD-7426-NM91, ORD-7502-PP18, e é, ORD-7599-RK20, por isso tecnicamente fora da janela mas vou, hmm, processá-las na mesma.
Customer: Hum, sinceramente? Este é é o melhor atendimento ao cliente que—como é que se diz—que tive em em muito tempo.
159. Só estou a fazer o meu trabalho. Mas como deve ser. Olha, o total que vais receber é 47,50. Número de referência REF-20943-CLM. Tira print disso.
Customer: Vou tirar, vou tirar, hum, olha há—há algum sítio onde possa possa deixar uma boa avaliação sobre ti ou ou assim?
160. Sinceramente? Sim. Hum, há um questionário depois desta chamada, e é, o meu ID de funcionária é EMP-4782-SS se quiseres mencionar-me especificamente, mas tipo, sem pressão, só fico, sabes, contente por termos resolvido isto.
Customer: Hum, então eu sou cliente há, eh, 12 anos e a minha conta está simplesmente—está completamente bloqueada, acho eu, e hum, isto é mesmo inaceitável.
161. Está bem. Deixa-me. Ver isso. Qual é o email da conta?
Customer: É, eh, janet ponto miller arroba, hum, arroba webmail ponto com e eu simplesmente—quer dizer, preciso mesmo que isto seja resolvido imediatamente.
162. Pronto então, hum, estou a ver a conta JNM-448392-Q aqui e, eh, isto é estranho na verdade, diz que houve, hmm, 5 tentativas falhadas de login? Há cerca de hum, há cerca de uma hora?
Customer: 5? Quer dizer eu tentei talvez—espera não na verdade—
163. Pois então, hum, o sistema bloqueia automaticamente depois de, eh, depois de 3 tentativas. But you said five so... hmm. Estavas talvez, hum, a tentar passwords diferentes ou...?
Customer: Eu estava simplesmente—olha eu tenho usado a mesma password há, hum, há anos e de repente simplesmente, eh, não está a funcionar e quer dizer isto é meio ridículo.
164. Certo certo. Então. A questão é. O nosso sistema mostra. A última mudança de password foi... ontem às 15:47.
Customer: Ontem? Não isso é—quer dizer eu não—hum, espera, eu recebi aquele email sobre, eh, sobre atualizar as definições de segurança mas pensei—
165. Ah está bem então, hum, mudaste mesmo então? Because I can see here, eh, o código de confirmação SEC-990281-K foi enviado para o teu email e, hmm, foi verificado por isso...
Customer: Talvez tenha—Deus isto é—desculpa estou mesmo stressada e—
166. Não não é, hum, é totalmente normal. Acontece sempre na verdade. Então, eh, talvez te lembres para o que mudaste? Ou tipo, hum, escreveste em algum lado...?
Customer: Eu normalmente só, hum, adiciono números à antiga mas eu—ah espera, eh, acho que talvez tenha—deixa-me ver a minha, hum, a minha app de notas.
167. Perfeito. Não tenhas pressa. While you're looking. Posso enviar um link de reset para o teu email de recuperação?
Customer: Encontrei! Oh meu Deus sou uma idiota, esqueci-me completamente que—
168. Ei não te preocupes, hum, a sério tipo tive 3 pessoas hoje com, eh, com a mesma coisa. So you're good to, hum, tentar fazer login agora ou queres aquele link de reset por via das dúvidas?
Customer: Vou tentar—sim está, hum, está a funcionar agora. I'm so sorry for, eh, por ser difícil, pensei que alguém tipo me tinha hackeado ou assim.
169. Percebo totalmente. Aquele pânico quando não consegues entrar. Happens to me with my bank like. Todos os meses.
Customer: Foste mesmo paciente, sei que provavelmente estava—enfim obrigada.
170. Ah por favor, hum, isto foi na verdade meio refrescante? Like usually it's, eh, problemas técnicos reais que não consigo resolver então, hmm, vitória fácil para mim hoje. Mais alguma coisa que precises enquanto tenho a tua conta REC-20241209-T aberta?
Customer: Então, hum, eu só queria—aliás espera, isto está a ser gravado? Porque tipo, a última agente com quem falei foi, ah, mesmo mesmo prestável e basicamente só queria ter a certeza que alguém fica a saber disso?
171. Oh, hum, isso é mesmo bom de ouvir. Deixa-me, ah, abrir aqui a tua conta para poder documentar isto como deve ser. Acho que só preciso do teu número de telefone para, hum, para encontrar a interação de há bocado?
Customer: Sim, então é, hum, deixa-me só—não espera esse é o meu antigo—ok então basicamente é 555-0142 e tipo...
172. Perfeito, já está. Então consigo ver aqui, hum, parece que falaste com a Agente Martinez sobre, ah, deixa-me ver... encomenda número ORD-9847-TK23, e isso foi resolvido há umas duas horas?
Customer: Sim! É isso—então basicamente ela foi tipo, hum, incrivelmente paciente porque eu estava assim, ah, a passar-me completamente com aquilo tudo e...
173. Mmm-hmm, estou só, hum, a tirar notas aqui. A documentar tudo como deve ser no ticket TKT-884921-M para a supervisora dela ver este feedback.
Customer: Ótimo porque tipo—quer dizer, ah, se isto acontecer outra vez não sei o que é que eu... enfim, ela basicamente salvou o meu evento todo por isso...
174. Acho que é, hum, mesmo importante para nós ouvir isto. Aliás, ah, consigo ver que ela foi em frente e aplicou um crédito de cortesia também, número de referência REF-7823-CC, o que deve ter ajudado com a situação?
Customer: Hum sim, exatamente, e tipo é mesmo isso—eu nem sequer pedi, ela simplesmente, ah, ofereceu porque percebeu o quão stressada eu estava e sinceramente depois de tudo o resto que correu mal...
175. Pois, pois. Então estou, hum, a adicionar tudo isto ao ficheiro de desempenho dela sob a recomendação COM-2847-PM, e, ah, acho que a chefe dela vai definitivamente querer reconhecer este tipo de serviço.
Customer: Então basicamente só, hum, certifica-te que ela sabe? Porque tipo, já liguei antes e normalmente é só... claro que nada funciona mas ela realmente, ah, ela realmente resolveu a coisa por isso...
176. Com certeza, vou garantir isso. Hum, aliás, sabes que mais? Vou, ah, sinalizar isto no nosso sistema sob o número de caso CSE-9921-QUAL como exemplo de excelente recuperação de serviço.
Customer: Ok então tipo—espera, ela recebe alguma coisa por isto? Porque hum, quer dizer, se há consequências da próxima vez para mau serviço devia haver, ah, recompensas para bom serviço ou...
177. Então, hum, nós temos mesmo um programa de reconhecimento. Não posso bem, ah, falar de especificidades mas acho que recomendações como esta definitivamente, hum, contam para as avaliações de desempenho e tal.
Customer: Eu só—então basicamente estou a dizer que tipo, ah, ela transformou o que ia ser um desastre completo em, hum, em algo controlável e não sei se percebes quão raro isso é ultimamente...
178. Não, eu, ah, percebo completamente. A sério. Deixa-me só... ok, encaminhei isto para a nossa equipa de qualidade sob QUA-7734-FB e eles provavelmente, hum, até podem usar isto para formação se estiveres de acordo?
Customer: Hum, sim claro, o que ajudar porque tipo—quer dizer, da próxima vez que alguém ligar sobre, ah, sobre um problema parecido deviam só... deviam fazer o que ela fez basicamente...
179. Pois, faz sentido. Então tenho tudo documentado aqui, número de referência para este elogio é CMP-8829-MTZ, e, hum, há mais alguma coisa sobre a interação que querias que eu anotasse?
Customer: Então tipo, hum, não propriamente, eu só—se mais agentes fossem como ela então talvez, ah, talvez eu não temesse ligar para o apoio ao cliente sempre que algo inevitavelmente corre... enfim sim, é basicamente isso.
180. Bem, hum, obrigada por teres dedicado tempo a ligar de volta sobre isto. Acho que faz mesmo, ah, diferença quando os clientes partilham feedback positivo, e vou garantir absolutamente que a Agente Martinez e a supervisora dela veem isto hoje sob sinalização prioritária PRI-4421-A.
Customer: Hum, o meu terminal está—não está—ah, preciso de ajuda. Já.
181. Certo! Ok então deixa-me abrir aqui a tua conta, podes dar-me o teu ID de comerciante ou o número de série do dispositivo que deve estar atrás?
Customer: Eu não—espera, ah, tenho tipo cinquenta pessoas na fila e estou—hum—a perder dinheiro aqui...
182. Sim sim, percebo perfeitamente, hum, então se virares o dispositivo deve ter um autocolante com SN- e depois uns números, ou posso procurar-te pelo nome da empresa se for mais rápido?
Customer: Ah, é—Food Heaven—não espera, hum, Heaven's Kitchen Food Truck.
183. Perfeito! Encontrei-te, conta MER-44892-TK, e consigo ver que o teu terminal Square SN-789456123 ficou offline há, oh! Doze minutos, foi quando parou?
Customer: Sim e eu tentei—hum, já desliguei e liguei tipo—ah, três vezes.
184. Boa jogada, é exatamente o que eu tentaria primeiro! Então, hum, a ver aqui os teus diagnósticos, o registo de transação TXN-445678901 mostra um timeout de rede, deixa-me só fazer aqui um reset remoto rápido.
Customer: Podes só—quanto tempo? As pessoas estão literalmente a ir embora.
185. Ok ok então o reset demora cerca de noventa segundos mas—oh espera! Estou a ver uma coisa aqui, a tua última transação bem-sucedida RCP-88234-P foi interrompida, o ecrã congelou durante um pagamento?
Customer: Hum, sim estava—o cliente estava a comprar tacos e depois—ah, parou...
186. Ahá! É é esse o problema mesmo, então quando a transação TXN-445678902 ficou presa bloqueou o sistema todo, mas boa notícia, posso forçar a limpeza daqui agora mesmo!
Customer: Então tipo, hum, como é que eu—é—o que acontece ao pagamento dele?
187. Então, hum, essa transação nunca foi concluída por isso o cartão dele não foi debitado, o número de referência VOID-22847-X confirma isso, e estou a enviar o comando de desbloqueio agora, deve demorar uns quinze segundos.
Customer: Quinze segundos. Ótimo. Só perdi, ah, metade da hora de almoço mas...tanto faz.
188. Eu sei eu sei, este timing é horrível, hum, mas olha—pronto! Código de estado 200-OK, o teu terminal deve estar a reiniciar agora com luz verde, estás a ver isso?
Customer: Está—espera, hum—oh. Sim. Verde. Está... mesmo a funcionar?
189. Sim! Adoro quando funciona assim tão rápido! O teu dispositivo está online outra vez, o ID de conexão NET-33492-LIVE mostra conectividade total, e, é, só para saberes, estou a creditar cinquenta euros na tua conta pelo incómodo, nota de crédito CRD-99234-F.
Customer: Oh. Hum, uau isso é—ah—não estava à espera... obrigada.
190. De nada! E hum, marquei a tua conta com código de prioridade PRI-GOLD-8823 por isso se isto voltar a acontecer saltas a fila, mas sinceramente não deve, esse bloqueio de transação é super raro.
Customer: Hm, provavelmente estou a ser mesmo estúpida mas, eh, disseram-me duas coisas completamente diferentes?
191. Oh interessante! Pronto pronto, deixa-me abrir aqui a tua conta com o número ACC-9947-TK23, and we'll figure out exactly what's going on together, o que é que te disseram?
Customer: Então hm, ontem alguém disse que o meu reembolso seria, tipo, instantâneo? Acho eu?
192. Ah sim, reembolso instantâneo, percebi, e depois, hm, o que é que o outro agente te disse porque isso é... hmm, that's definitely one option we have.
Customer: Mas depois, eh, esta manhã? Disseram 7 a 10 dias úteis, which is totally different...
193. Ok então, aqui entre nós, both agents were technically right, que eu sei que parece uma loucura mas a tua encomenda RMA-5582-QV tem duas opções de reembolso e parece que nenhum dos agentes, hm, explicou isso como deve ser.
Customer: Quer dizer, provavelmente sou só eu que não estou a perceber, desculpa, eh, o que queres dizer com duas opções?
194. Não não não, tu estás a perceber perfeitamente! So here's the deal, se escolheres crédito da loja com o código CRD-8847-ML9, isso é instantâneo na tua conta, mas se quiseres de volta no teu método de pagamento original, that's the 7 to 10 days.
Customer: Ah. Hm, uau, sinto-me um bocado parva agora, that makes sense...
195. Olha, hm, nem te preocupes porque sinceramente? Our system should prompt agents to explain both options, e claramente alguém falhou aqui, não foste tu.
Customer: Então tipo, eh, qual é que eu escolhi mesmo? Ou ainda não escolhi?
196. That's the fun part! A ver o teu caso número CSE-7729-BN aqui, ninguém selecionou nenhuma das opções ainda, so you get to choose right now, e pessoalmente? Eu escolheria o crédito instantâneo se compras aqui regularmente.
Customer: Hm, sim, quer dizer, eu compro aqui muito, so maybe... eh, o crédito?
197. Perfeito! Então vou, eh, processar isso agora mesmo como crédito da loja, and here's what's cool, o teu código de crédito STC-9903-FF44 vai literalmente estar no teu email tipo, como é que se diz... instantaneamente, assim que desligarmos.
Customer: Espera a sério? Like actually instant this time?
198. Mesmo instantâneo, prometo, e aqui entre nós? I'm also adding an extra 15% bonus ao montante do crédito BNS-4421-XL por causa da confusão, que tecnicamente não devia fazer mas...
Customer: Oh uau, hm, isso é mesmo simpático, quer dizer, não precisas de...
199. Já está feito! So your original refund of $67.50 agora está a aparecer como $77.63 em crédito na transação TXN-8856-QQW2, deve chegar à tua caixa de entrada em cerca de 30 segundos.
Customer: Isso é, eh, incrível, muito obrigada, I was getting kind of frustrated mas...
200. Ei, isso é totalmente justo, hm, getting different info is super annoying, mas agora está tudo resolvido com o número de confirmação CNF-2234-RTP9 e sinceramente? Enjoy that extra credit, mereceste pela tua paciência connosco.
Customer: Então eu estou, hum, estou a ligar porque, é, clientes novos têm—têm cinquenta por cento de desconto? E eu tenho sido, hum, fiel há anos.
201. Ah, compreendo perfeitamente porque é que isso seria frustrante, sinceramente também me sinto assim quando vejo essas promoções para clientes novos por todo o lado, deixa-me só abrir aqui a tua conta, podes dar-me o número de conta ou o número de telefone associado?
Customer: É o, é, é o 555—espera não, desculpa—é o 555-0142.
202. Perfeito, então estou a ver aqui a conta ACC-4892-N e, hum, tens toda a razão, és nossa cliente desde, é, 2018 que é mesmo... quer dizer, é uma fidelidade incrível e, hum, sinceramente o sistema devia reconhecer isso melhor do que reconhece...
Customer: Pois. Era—era isso que eu pensava.
203. Então o que posso fazer é o seguinte, e hum, acho que vais mesmo gostar disto porque, é, embora não possa aplicar retroativamente essa promoção de cliente novo, estou a ver que há um código de recompensa de fidelidade LYL-2024-GOLD que, hmm, na verdade dá-te sessenta por cento de desconto nos próximos três meses em vez de apenas os cinquenta por uma vez...
Customer: Espera. Espera, a sério? Sessenta?
204. Sim! E, hum, sinceramente entre nós, é tipo melhor porque, é, a coisa de cliente novo é só para o primeiro mês mas isto são, tipo, três meses completos com esse desconto, então a tua nova mensalidade seria, hum, deixa-me calcular... 23,99€ em vez de 59,99€.
Customer: Isso é—está bem está bem, isso é mesmo... uau.
205. Pois é! E também estou, hum, a ver que podemos adicionar, é, as funcionalidades premium sem custo extra, então isso é o número de referência REF-7734-PREMIUM, e hum, basicamente vais ficar com mais do que os clientes novos recebem, que parece mais justo, sabes?
Customer: Eu não—eu não esperava, hum, quer dizer pensei que ia ter que, é, lutar por alguma coisa.
206. Não não não, de todo, quer dizer és nossa cliente há seis anos, isso importa-nos, importa mesmo, e embora o nosso departamento de marketing faça estas coisas chamativas para clientes novos que eu sei que pode parecer mesmo injusto, nós temos estes programas de fidelidade que simplesmente... não são tão bem publicitados como deviam ser...
Customer: Então isto é, hum, isto é permanente? Ou só—só os três meses?
207. Então os sessenta por cento de desconto são para três meses com o código promocional SAVE60-VET que estou a aplicar agora mesmo, mas depois disso vais continuar a ter um desconto de fidelidade de vinte por cento para sempre enquanto mantiveres a conta, isso fica registado com o ID de benefício BEN-2024-8823-LP.
Customer: Isso é... quer dizer, hum, para a próxima vez talvez—talvez vocês devessem, é, avisar as pessoas sobre isto?
208. Tens toda a razão, e acho que... sinceramente perdemos bons clientes porque não sabem que estas opções existem, é algo que já mencionei antes aliás...
Customer: Bem, hum, agradeço—agradeço-te por, é, resolveres isto. Estava bastante, hum, bastante frustrada.
209. Totalmente compreensível, também ficaria frustrada, mas estou mesmo contente por termos conseguido dar a volta a isto, a tua nova tarifa começa com o próximo ciclo de faturação no dia quinze, número de confirmação CNF-9982-APPROVED, e vais receber um email com todos estes detalhes dentro de uma hora mais ou menos.
Customer: Está bem. Está bem ótimo. Obri—obrigada.
210. De nada! E sinceramente obrigada EU por ficares connosco todos estes anos, se precisares de mais alguma coisa, a tua referência de conta atualizada é ACC-4892-N-GOLD, basta mencionares isso e qualquer agente verá o teu estatuto VIP, tem um excelente resto de dia!
Customer: Hi, I think there's—there's a problem with my account? Double charge?
211. Oh um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here real quick and um, sorry, it's been one of those days, uh, can I get your email or order number?
Customer: It's, um, probably under jkimura at, uh, medtech clinic? I just—I just need to sort of figure this out.
212. Perfect, okay I've got you here, Jennifer Kimura, and I'm seeing your recent purchase for the ultrasound continuing education modules, transaction ID TXN-847291-QR, is that what you're calling about?
Customer: Yes yes yes, that's, um, that's it. But I think maybe it charged me, uh, twice?
213. Oh boy, let me check this... yeah so I'm actually seeing two charges here, one for $299 with receipt RCP-55024-M and another identical one with RCP-55025-M just three minutes later, that's definitely not right.
Customer: Are you sure it's, um, not just like a hold or, uh, something? I mean, I really can't afford two charges right now.
214. No no, these are both completed transactions unfortunately, but um, here's what I can do—I'm already initiating a refund for the duplicate charge, reference number REF-990837-XK, should hit your account in 3-5 business days.
Customer: Okay but, um, will I still have access? I mean, I sort of need—need these modules for tomorrow?
215. Absolutely! Um, so your access code EDU-77812-VPN is, uh, totally fine, um, the duplicate was just a payment glitch on our end, happens sometimes when the, er, system hiccups.
Customer: That's—that's good. You're sure though? Tomorrow's important.
216. Oh totally sure, um, I'm actually looking at your learning portal right now and, uh, everything's active, all twelve modules ready to go, and um, honestly between you and me? This payment system drives me crazy too.
Customer: Okay okay, I think that's probably fine then. Three to five days?
217. Yeah so, um, technically it's 3-5 business days but, uh, usually it's faster, like most people see it in, um, two days? I put a priority flag on your refund ticket TKT-440926-B just to, er, help it along.
Customer: That's actually—actually really helpful. Thank you.
218. Right right, no problem at all, and um, hey, if you don't see it by like, uh, Thursday? Just call back with that refund reference number I gave you, um, REF-990837-XK, and whoever you get can, er, escalate it.
Customer: I think I've got it. You've been—been really quick about this.
219. Oh good, um, yeah I try to just, uh, fix these things fast because honestly our payment processor has been, um, super glitchy lately and uh, you're like the third duplicate charge today.
Customer: Third? That's sort of concerning.
220. I know, I know, we're supposedly getting a whole new system next month, order tracking update scheduled for March with project code UPG-2024-03, but honestly I'll believe it when I see it, anyway you're all set, anything else I can help with today?
Customer: Hi! So basically I clean houses and like, I need to talk about my billing?
221. Um, hello there! Let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can I get your, um, account number or maybe the phone number associated with it?
Customer: Oh sure, it's under my business name actually—so like, Sparkle Clean Services?
222. Got it, um, let me just... okay so I'm seeing account BIZ-4472-SC here, and uh, it looks like you're on our, um, monthly automatic billing cycle, is that right?
Customer: Yeah exactly! So um, here's the thing, like my clients are all switching their payment schedules and um, I'm kind of in a weird spot?
223. I see, I see. So, um, what kind of changes are you, uh, thinking about? I mean, we have several options that might, um, work better for your situation.
Customer: Well so basically some pay me weekly now, some biweekly, it's like totally all over the place!
224. Right, that's, uh, that's actually pretty common with service businesses. Let me check what we can do here with your current plan under reference code REF-9981-MZ.
Customer: Wait so um, is this gonna mess up my whole account? Like I've been a customer for three years and uh, what if this makes everything complicated?
225. No no, it's going to be okay, really. Um, so what I can do is, uh, set up what we call a flexible billing option under plan FLX-2234-A, which basically lets you, um, adjust payment dates as needed.
Customer: Oh! So like, that's actually a thing you guys do?
226. Absolutely, yes. I think what would work best is, um, we put you on our variable schedule system VSS-7761-B, and then you can, uh, basically choose your billing date each month.
Customer: Okay but wait, um, what if I forget to pick a date? Like sometimes I get so busy with clients and uh, you know how it is...
227. That's totally understandable. So, um, the system will actually send you, uh, reminder emails five days before, and if you don't respond it just, um, defaults to your original date.
Customer: Oh that's actually perfect! So basically I'm not gonna get in trouble or anything?
228. Not at all, not at all. Let me just, um, make these changes now under modification code MOD-5547-K, and uh, you'll get a confirmation email within, I'd say, probably ten minutes or so.
Customer: You're like the best! So um, this starts right away or like next month or...?
229. So, uh, it'll take effect starting with your next billing cycle, which looks like, um, let me see here... that's gonna be the fifteenth. Reference number for this change is CHG-8823-VP.
Customer: Perfect! So basically I just email you guys whenever I need to switch it up?
230. Exactly right. Um, you can email, call, or actually use the app too. Your case number today is CSE-4419-TL if you need to, uh, reference this conversation later.
Customer: Um, hi, I need to get some, uh, documentation for a purchase I made?
231. Okay okay, so, um, I can definitely help with that, let me just—let me just pull up your account here and, uh, basically what we'll need is your order number or, um, the email address you used?
Customer: It's for my job—I'm a park ranger and the, um... the deadline is tomorrow.
232. Oh oh, right right, so so you need this for, um, for reimbursement, and—and I totally get that, like deadlines are, uh, they're they're really stressful, so let me see what information you have and we'll get this sorted quickly, do you have an order number?
Customer: I think—no wait, let me check—it should be... somewhere here...
233. No worries, um, take your time, or or if you have the, uh, the approximate date or even just, like, what the purchase was for, I can—I can search for it that way?
Customer: Um, it was, uh, GPS equipment? Like two weeks ago, maybe, um, the fifteenth?
234. Perfect perfect, so so I'm seeing, um, let me just—okay so there's an order here, ORD-4521-GPS, placed on October fifteenth for, uh, for a Garmin unit, total was $487.92, is—is that the one?
Customer: Yes! That's it. Are you sure you can get me the paperwork today?
235. So unfortunately—and and I really wish I had, um, better news here—the standard documentation usually takes, uh, takes like 24 to 48 hours to process through our system, which which I know doesn't help with your deadline...
Customer: Of course. Just... tell me what I need to do then.
236. But but wait, so, um, between you and me? I'm gonna—I'm gonna try something here, there's this, uh, this expedited receipt function we have for, like, corporate accounts, and technically technically park services might qualify?
Customer: Really? I mean, that would actually... is that allowed?
237. Okay okay, so so I've just, um, I've tagged your request as priority code PRI-889X and, uh, basically what I'm doing is—is routing it through our, like, our government services channel?
Customer: Um, okay, so how long will that—when would I actually get it?
238. So so with this—with this priority routing, you should, um, you should have the full documentation with receipt number RCP-4521-DOC in your email within, uh, within the next two hours, maybe maybe even sooner?
Customer: Two hours? Are you absolutely sure? Because if it doesn't come...
239. I—I totally understand your concern, and and honestly, um, I'm showing here that 95% of these priority requests process in under, uh, under an hour, so so you should be fine, but but just to be safe, I'm also adding my direct extension, it's 5847?
Customer: Okay, um, that's... what's the word... really above and beyond. Thank you.
240. No no, it's—it's my pleasure, and and honestly, like, park rangers do such important work, so, um, I've confirmed everything's submitted with tracking ID TRK-90021-RUSH, and uh, you should be all set for your deadline tomorrow!
Customer: Hum, olá, preciso de, ah, contestar uma cobrança e sou cliente há tipo oito anos, portanto...
241. Está bem, hum, deixe-me só... hmm, abrir aqui a sua conta. Qual é o, ah, número de telefone associado à conta para eu, hum, entrar no sistema e ver o que se passa?
Customer: É hum, espere que tenho de falar baixo porque os miúdos estão a dormir mas é 555-0147 e isto é mesmo...
242. Perfeito, perfeito.
Customer: Então há esta, ah, cobrança de quarenta euros que eu nunca, hum, autorizei e sinceramente como é que eu sei que isto não é algum tipo de...
243. Não não não, vamos resolver isto com certeza. Hum, então estou a ver a conta ACT-7829-WK e, ah, deixe-me ver aqui... está bem, então há uma cobrança de 15 de outubro para, hmm, pacote de serviços premium PRE-4419X, é a isso que se refere?
Customer: Premium? Eu nunca subscrevi nada premium, é exatamente isto que eu quero dizer...
244. Pois pois.
Customer: Hum, e tipo, todos os meses é uma coisa nova, ah, primeiro foi aquela coisa dos dados e agora isto e eu simplesmente...
245. Está bem então, hum, estou a ver aqui um padrão na verdade. Deixe-me só, ah, ver melhor o histórico de transações TXN-88291-Q e, hmm, e se... oh! Ah espere, já percebi o que aconteceu! Houve uma, hum, ativação automática do código de promoção PRM-6672 que, ah, não devia ter sido acionada no seu tipo de conta.
Customer: Ativação automática? Vê, é exatamente este tipo de coisa que me faz pensar que vocês estão só a tentar...
246. Não não, hum, ouça, isto foi completamente erro nosso e, ah, já estou a processar o reembolso. Número de referência REF-3847-MNK para o reembolso total mais, hmm, deixe-me ver o que mais posso... pronto, também vou adicionar um crédito de cortesia de, hum, mais quarenta euros pelo incómodo.
Customer: Espere, está mesmo, hum, está mesmo a resolver isto? Porque normalmente quando ligo é só...
247. Com certeza.
Customer: Hum, está bem mas tipo, como é que eu sei que isto não vai, ah, acontecer outra vez no próximo mês porque eu não posso estar sempre...
248. Então, hum, o que estou a fazer agora é, ah, colocar um código de bloqueio BLK-9901-AA na sua conta que, hmm, basicamente impede quaisquer adesões ou upgrades automáticos sem, hum, confirmação verbal explícita gravada no ID de chamada CID-447829. Ninguém pode adicionar nada sem a senhora aprovar pessoalmente.
Customer: Quer dizer, estou convosco desde 2016 e é mesmo, hum, frustrante quando estas coisas continuam...
249. Hum, sim não, compreendo perfeitamente e, ah, vendo o histórico da sua conta... hmm, realmente tem sido fiel e, hum, aliás! Acabei de descobrir uma coisa! Qualifica-se para o nosso, ah, programa de ajuste de tarifa por fidelidade LRP-2024-B que reduz a sua tarifa base em, hum, quinze por cento daqui para a frente.
Customer: Oh isso é... hum, quer dizer isso ajudava mesmo muito porque com os custos da creche e tudo...
250. Perfeito! Então, hum, está tudo aplicado. A sua confirmação é CNF-88412-PPX para o reembolso que, ah, deve aparecer em 3 a 5 dias úteis, e o, hmm, o desconto de fidelidade começa imediatamente no seu próximo ciclo de faturação. E hum, como disse, nada pode ser adicionado sem a sua autorização explícita agora, por isso está, ah, totalmente protegida daqui para a frente.
Customer: Eu só... nem consigo... A minha encomenda, diz—desculpa, o tracking diz entregue mas eu nunca...
251. Pois, já vi isto antes. Tens a tua conta aberta? Consigo provavelmente, hm, resolver isto em cerca de, eh, 2 segundos se tiveres o número da encomenda à mão.
Customer: Hm, eu não—espera, quer dizer, sim, algures... Deus, não consigo pensar direito...
252. Sem problema, sem problema. Acho que consigo, hm, provavelmente encontrar só com o teu, eh, email ou telefone. Whatever's easier.
Customer: É que... tem corrido tudo mal e agora isto... Eu precisava mesmo daquele pacote.
253. Estou a perceber. Então, hm, deixa-me só, eh, ver as tuas encomendas recentes aqui e—okay okay, estou a ver 3 da semana passada. Era a que termina em, hm, acho que ORD-9482-XL?
Customer: Não essa—desculpa, não é essa. A outra—quer dizer, a encomenda de terça. Ou foi segunda?
254. Entendido, entendido. Então é a, hm, ORD-9477-PK, feita segunda às, eh, 15:47. Mostra entregue ontem às 14:15. Alpendre da frente.
Customer: Não há nada lá! Procurei em todo o lado, nas traseiras—não espera, quer dizer, no portão lateral, nos arbustos...
255. Hm, então o que vou fazer, e já, eh, já fiz isto provavelmente umas 100 vezes por isso, hm, vamos resolver isto. First let me check if maybe the driver marked the wrong, eh, a entrega errada.
Customer: Oh meu Deus, hm, e se alguém a roubou? Eu não posso pagar—desculpa, quer dizer, podes simplesmente enviar outra?
256. Então, eh, estou a ver o GPS ping da entrega e está, hmm, está a mostrar cerca de, hm, 12 metros do teu endereço. Might've gone to a neighbor?
Customer: Espera, 12 metros? Isso é... oh meu Deus, devem ser os Johnsons. Não—desculpa, do outro lado. Os Nguyens. They're away and I'm just... estou tão cansada de tudo ser complicado.
257. Acho que estamos, hm, na pista certa. Então então então, deixa-me só, eh, verificar a foto que tiraram—sim, porta azul. A tua é azul?
Customer: Vermelha. É vermelha. Claro que é no sítio errado... Eu só, desculpa, normalmente não sou assim mas é a medicação da minha mãe e tenho andado a lidar com o seguro a semana toda e agora isto e não consigo parar de falar, desculpa, nervous habit when things go wrong...
258. Hey hey, não não não, percebo perfeitamente. Então, hm, deixa-me só—vou, eh, marcar isto como mal entregue agora mesmo, número de referência MSD-7739-QT22, e acho que conseguimos provavelmente enviar uma substituição, hm, hoje ainda.
Customer: Hoje? A sério? Oh meu Deus, obrigada, eu só... espera, consegues fazer isso? Even though it's—quer dizer, já é quinta à tarde...
259. Hm, bem, talvez não devesse prometer mas, eh, mas mas como é medicação, vou, hm, marcar como prioridade com código, eh, URGENT-MED-8847. Deve deve sair dentro de uma hora.
Customer: Desculpa estar uma confusão, é que tem sido... sabes quando tudo se acumula? E depois o teu pacote desaparece e é como se o universo estivesse—desculpa, estou a divagar outra vez, faço isto quando estou stressada, my therapist says it's a coping mechanism, e oh Deus estou a fazê-lo agora não estou?
260. Estás estás perfeitamente bem, a sério. Hm, então só para, eh, confirmar tudo aqui—novo pacote sai hoje, o tracking vai ser, hm, TRK-9477-PK-R2, e talvez ponha uma nota para o motorista sobre a porta vermelha? Just to, you know, ter a certeza?
Customer: Eu... provavelmente fiz. Fiz alguma coisa mal. Mas o meu autopay? Não... não passou.
261. Ah! Deixa-me ver isso já—adoro resolver estes mistérios de autopay! Qual é o teu número de conta? Should be something like ACC followed by some digits.
Customer: É... ah. Desculpa. Sou tão má nestas coisas. ACC... 4521... B?
262. ACC-4521-B, perfeito! Está bem, estou a ver a tentativa de pagamento do dia 15... OH! Acho que encontrei o culpado! O teu cartão que termina em 3847?
Customer: Sim, esse é... esse mesmo. Será que eu estraguei o...
263. Não não não, tu fizeste tudo bem! The bank declined it with code ERR-2745-INSUFF. Basicamente, tentou processar às 3:47 da manhã e provavelmente não havia saldo disponível naquele momento exato.
Customer: Oh meu Deus. Estou tão... Isto é para a minha mãe... o fornecedor de oxigénio dela. Eles precisam...
264. Oh uau, está bem, isso é definitivamente importante. Deixa-me ver o que posso—actually, hold on, I think I can manually retry this right now with override code OVR-9923-X.
Customer: Tu consegues? Eu acabei de. Transferi dinheiro mas. Não fui rápida o suficiente e...
265. Já estou a tratar disso! O sistema está a lutar comigo aqui mas—YES! Consegui! Transaction TXN-8847-ZK is processing now. Deve ficar pronto em dois minutos, talvez?
Customer: A sério? Eu pensava. Quando falha uma vez é só...
266. Normalmente, sim, but medical suppliers get special handling protocols under policy MED-7736-A. Basicamente posso forçar a transação desde que os fundos estejam lá agora.
Customer: Estão. Quer dizer. Devem estar? A menos que eu...
267. Deixa-me só... a verificar... SIM! Pagamento confirmado! Reference number REF-3928-KL for your records. Passou agora mesmo, 247.50€.
Customer: Oh graças a Deus. Obrigada. Estava com tanto medo que eles... cortassem o serviço dela ou...
268. Compreendo perfeitamente. Actually, I think we should probably set up a backup payment method under your profile ID PRF-4521-B-SEC, por precaução?
Customer: Sim. Sim. Isso é... inteligente. Eu devia ter...
269. Olha, estas coisas acontecem! The backup system code BCK-1147 will try your secondary card if the primary fails. Queres que configure isso agora?
Customer: Por favor? Se tu... se não for pedir demais...
270. Já estou a adicionar! O teu backup está agora ativo sob confirmação CNF-9984-PP. Next autopay on the 15th will try your main card first, then backup if needed. Crise oficialmente evitada!
Customer: Hum, olá, então eu estou a ligar por causa de, ah, estas cobranças que estão, er, não estão a bater certo com os nossos POs?
271. Então, hum, posso definitivamente ajudá-la com isso, deixe-me só, ah, abrir aqui a sua conta. Pode dar-me o seu, tipo, número de conta ou talvez um número de purchase order para eu conseguir, hum, ver o que se está a passar?
Customer: É hum, espera, qual é que precisa, because I have like three different POs here and they're all wrong!
272. Ok ok, então basicamente vamos começar com, hum, qualquer um deles—quer dizer, o que tiver mais à mão—and I can pull up your whole account from there, provavelmente consigo ver todas as transações recentes.
Customer: PO-7742, não espera, ah, PO-7742-B, e era suposto ser 3.200$ mas cobraram-nos 4.100$!
273. Certo então, hum, estou a ver aqui o PO-7742-B e, ah, consigo ver a discrepância. Então basicamente o que aconteceu é que, tipo, há um item adicional com código INV-8829-QX que foi, hum, adicionado depois do purchase order inicial ser processado.
Customer: Mas isso é, hum, isso não é assim que funciona, we can't just have random charges appearing!
274. Não não, tem toda a razão, e eu estou, ah, mesmo desculpe por esta confusão. Então deixe-me ver melhor aqui—parece que, hum, alguém do nosso lado marcou isto como reposição automática mas as configurações da sua conta mostram, tipo, apenas aprovação manual.
Customer: Hum, exatamente! E há mais, tipo, a encomenda de brocas da semana passada está, ah, a aparecer duas vezes?
275. Então estou a ver isso—order ORD-5543-MN91, certo? Pois então, hum, isto definitivamente não—quer dizer, this shouldn't have happened. Deixe-me, ah, basicamente verificar se isto foi um erro de sistema ou se alguém manualmente, tipo, duplicou isto de alguma forma.
Customer: Isto é, hum, uma confusão total, I have to report all this to accounting and they're gonna totally freak out.
276. Percebo.
Customer: Consegue, tipo, resolver isto tudo hoje? Porque hum, o nosso audit é... como é que se diz... está iminente!
277. Então aqui está o que posso fazer—e estou, hum, tipo limitada pelo nosso sistema mas—I can issue immediate credits for the duplicate charge, é o crédito número CRD-9901-LP22, mas a, ah, a outra discrepância precisa de aprovação do supervisor.
Customer: Oh hum, ok isso é, er, isso é mesmo muito útil, thank you so much for finding that!
278. Então basicamente estou a fazer o pedido agora, e, hum, normally it takes 24-48 hours mas estou a marcar como urgente com número de referência URG-3356-KT porque, tipo, consigo ver que tem múltiplos problemas aqui que precisam de ser resolvidos.
Customer: Está a ser tão, hum, prestável, agradeço mesmo que esteja a ouvir em vez de só, er, despachar-me!
279. Quer dizer, I've been doing this job long enough to know how frustrating these billing issues can be. Então deixe-me também, hum, adicionar aqui uma nota sobre o seu prazo de auditoria—quando é exatamente?
Customer: Hum, é sexta-feira, so like, three days, é por isso que estou um bocado, ah, a entrar em pânico!
280. Ok então, hum, estou a escalar isto com flag de prioridade PRI-7765-XX e basicamente, ah, gostava de poder garantir que vai ser resolvido até lá, but realistically our billing department is pretty backed up. Mas documentei tudo com número de caso CSE-20489-BN44 para que tenha, hum, prova de que estas discrepâncias foram reportadas antes da sua auditoria.
Customer: Pois então a minha a minha liquidificadora avariou. A garantia expirou a semana passada.
281. Ah, hum, lamento mesmo ouvir isso. Então deixe-me só—aliás espera, deixe-me, é... abrir aqui primeiro a tua conta. Podes dar-me o teu, hum, o teu número de encomenda ou o email que usaste?
Customer: Está está na caixa algures. Espera espera.
282. Sem pressa nenhuma. Enquanto procuras, também posso, é... procurar pelo teu número de telefone se for... como é que se diz... mais conveniente? Então basicamente, hum, só preciso de qualquer forma de encontrar a tua conta aqui no sistema.
Customer: Hum, está bem então é, é... james ponto carter arroba gmail. Esse é esse é o email.
283. Perfeito, perfeito. Então estou a ver aqui... ok então a tua conta ACC-45821-J mostra que compraste a, hum, a ProBlend 5000 a 15 de outubro do ano passado, e isso faria a data de expiração da tua garantia, é... deixa-me só calcular... 15 de outubro deste ano, que foi, bem, exatamente há oito dias.
Customer: Oito dias. Claro claro que são oito dias.
284. Pois, eu sei, o timing é mesmo—deixa-me só—aliás, hum, antes de continuarmos, podes dizer-me o que é que aconteceu exatamente? Tipo, é... qual é o... qual é o problema específico que estás a ter?
Customer: Hum, simplesmente, é... não liga mais. Nada. Morta morta morta.
285. Ok então, hum, quero explicar-te umas coisas aqui, e, é... aqui entre nós? A tua garantia expirou no dia 15 com número de referência WAR-2023-10-88745, mas, bem, há uma coisa chamada... como é que se chama... um período de carência que, hum, nem toda a gente conhece.
Customer: Período de carência? Como é que eu sei—espera, como é que eu sei que isto não é só algum algum truque?
286. Não não, pergunta totalmente justa. Então deixa-me explicar—aliás, é... deixa-me recomeçar. No teu documento de garantia, hum, se olhares para a secção 7.2 sob o código GRACE-EXT-30, basicamente diz que para, é... para falhas dentro de trinta dias da expiração, podemos... bem, podemos rever para o que eles chamam "exceções de falha catastrófica."
Customer: Eu não—quer dizer já não tenho esse papel. Devo ter deitado fora provavelmente.
287. Não faz mal, não faz mal nada. Então, hum, olha o que estou a ver no teu processo CSE-99412-BRK. A ProBlend 5000 tem tido alguns, é... alguns problemas conhecidos com a... como é que se diz... a placa controladora do motor? E aqui entre nós, hum, temos aprovado a maioria destes mesmo depois da garantia.
Customer: Hum, então estás estás a dizer que talvez substituam mesmo?
288. Bem, então, é... preciso de—deixa-me só—preciso de submeter isto para revisão primeiro. Mas, hum, baseando-me no que estou a ver com o código de falha FLC-MOTOR-500 no nosso sistema, e o facto de serem só, é... oito dias depois? Diria que tens uma muito, bem, uma muito boa hipótese aqui.
Customer: Ok ok, então o que o que é que preciso de fazer?
289. Certo, então, hum, super simples na verdade. Vou, é... criar um número de processo para ti agora mesmo—vai ser, bem, deixa-me gerar isto... CAS-2024-78823-JC. E depois só precisas de, hum, de tirar uma foto do número de série na parte de baixo e, é... enviar por email para o nosso departamento de reclamações.
Customer: Número de série, parte de baixo, percebi percebi. E depois e depois o quê?
290. Então quando eles receberem isso, hum, e esta é a parte boa, como estou a pôr aqui uma nota com, é... com código de exceção EXC-GRACE-APPROVED-PENDING, eles devem basicamente só, bem, carimbar e pronto. Vais ter notícias em tipo, hum, dois a três dias úteis, e depois enviamos-te uma unidade de substituição com número de tracking a começar por TRK.
Customer: Um, I need to... what's the word... escalate this. My medication. It's, uh, it's not here and I'm almost out.
291. Oh no, I completely get it—my mom's diabetic so I know how scary that is when meds run low. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your order number?
Customer: It's, um... hold on... ORD-4472-BN. I've been a customer for, uh, six years. This is... what do you call it... unacceptable.
292. Got that, um, ORD-4472-BN and I'm, uh, I'm seeing here that it's... oh. Okay so, um, there's a delay and I'm really, really sorry about this...
Customer: A delay? I have two pills left. Two.
293. I know, I know, this is, um, this is awful and I'm just... let me check the tracking, it's showing, uh, package ID PKG-77293-XM is stuck at the distribution center since...
Customer: Since when? This is, um... how do I put this... life or death. Not, uh, not some random package.
294. Right right.
Customer: I mean, um, I've never missed a payment. Ever. And now you're, uh, telling me... what exactly?
295. So, um, honestly? I'm gonna level with you here—the system shows it's been sitting there for, uh, three days, tracking number TRK-882916-L, and that's just... I mean, that shouldn't happen...
Customer: Three days. While I'm rationing medication.
296. Listen, I'm, um, I'm putting in an emergency override right now, reference number REF-9982-QK12, and, uh, calling the distribution center directly which I don't usually...
Customer: You can do that? Will it... will it actually help?
297. Between you and me? I used to work dispatch before this, so I know exactly who to call. Your prescription RX-4419-MED is getting flagged for same-day courier service.
Customer: Um, same-day? Like... today? You're, uh, you're sure about that?
298. Absolutely. Confirmation code CNF-20847-A will pop up in your email, should be there within four hours, five max.
Customer: I... okay. That would work. That would actually work.
299. And hey, um, I'm also adding a credit, code CRD-445-RUSH, for the, uh, for the whole mess, because this just... this never should've...
Customer: Thank you. Really. I was starting to think nobody there understood.
300. No no, I get it completely. Keep that reference number REF-9982-QK12 just in case, but you should be all set by this afternoon.
Customer: Hum, olá. Eu só... eh, preciso de ajuda com a minha conta. Está, hum. Mais alta do que o normal?
301. Pronto pronto. Deixa-me—deixa-me ver isso. Número de conta ou—espera, desculpa, o número de telefone também serve...
Customer: Er, é que. As minhas horas foram cortadas. No trabalho. Hum. Preciso mesmo de perceber isto.
302. Entendido. Certo certo. Então estou a ver a conta... espera aí... ACC-7829-BK12 aqui. Extrato de dezembro. Está está a mostrar... dá-me um segundo...
Customer: Hum, há estas cobranças? Eu não. Eh. Não as reconheço.
303. Mm-hmm. A ver. A ver. Então há—pronto, três secções principais na tua conta TXN-4482-XJ. Serviço base. Extras. E depois...
Customer: As contas médicas do meu filho, hum, são. Er. Já são tanto. Preciso de cada euro.
304. Eu percebo. A sério. Deixa-me—deixa-me explicar isto item por item. A primeira cobrança REF-9921-LP é a tua mensalidade normal. Essa essa é sempre 39,99.
Customer: Pronto. Hum. Essa é normal. E a de. Eh. 50 euros?
305. Certo. Então hum, essa é—espera aí, essa é a... não espera, desculpa, quero dizer o upgrade premium de 20 de novembro. Código UPG-6634-TT22. Tu adicionaste o o pacote de desporto...
Customer: Desporto? Mas eu. Hum. Cancelei isso. Er, há semanas.
306. Deixa-me só... a verificar... a verificar as notas aqui... Ah. Ah pronto pronto. Estou a ver. Tu cancelaste no dia 28 mas o o ciclo de faturação já... it doesn't prorate mid-cycle, então...
Customer: Espera, a sério? Então estou. Eh. A pagar por algo que não tenho?
307. Infelizmente é—é assim que o sistema... Mas. Mas mas mas. Deixa-me verificar outra coisa. Referência CRD-3847-MN91. There might be something here...
Customer: Hum, eu simplesmente. Não posso pagar cobranças extra. Mãe solteira. Er. Sabes?
308. Encontrei algo. Então então então, há um crédito de fidelidade que eu posso—eu posso aplicar. 25 euros. Código de crédito CMP-7722-QR. Não é o valor total mas... it's definitely something...
Customer: A sério? Oh! Hum. Isso. Eh, isso ajudava! Mesmo?
309. Já estou a processar. Deve aparecer como linha de crédito CRD-8837-PP dentro de... hmm, dentro de 2 dias. E também também, para o próximo mês? I'm noting here to prevent any overlap charges...
Customer: Eu não esperava. Hum. Isto é ótimo! Er, obrigada. Mesmo.
310. De nada. Mesmo. E hum, só para saberes, referencia este ID de chamada CLL-9983-KM42 se precisares de mais alguma coisa. O crédito está garantido. Already in the system...
Customer: Preciso de—preciso de cancelar esta esta coisa do período experimental. Antes que me cobrem.
311. Entendido. Então hum, deixa-me só, ah, abrir aqui a tua conta e... se me pudesses dar o email com que te registaste?
Customer: É é hum, jason.martinez arroba gmail. Eu só—só não quero que me cobrem está bem?
312. Certo. Sim. Então já tenho aqui a tua conta, JMZ-847392-T, e hum, vejo que estás no dia doze do período experimental de catorze dias portanto... na verdade ainda tens dois dias mas deixa-me só... processar já este cancelamento.
Customer: Hum está bem está bem, então tipo, tu estás estás mesmo a ajudar-me? Pensei que isto ia ser—ser mais difícil.
313. Claro. Então hum, a questão é a seguinte, ah, quando cancelo isto—e vou fazê-lo—perdes o acesso imediatamente. Não daqui a dois dias. Agora mesmo. Se isso for... quer dizer se não te importares então...
Customer: Oh. Oh eu não—não sabia dessa parte.
314. Pois pois. Sim. Então, hum, o que algumas pessoas fazem é, ah, meter um lembrete para tipo o dia treze? E depois cancelam? Assim aproveitam o período experimental todo e... mas quer dizer se quiseres que cancele já agora posso fazê-lo.
Customer: Hum isso é isso é mesmo... estás a ser muito prestável. Desculpa se parecei—parecei zangada antes.
315. Não não. Olha. Hum, eu percebo. Estes períodos experimentais podem ser, ah, complicados e... olha deixa-me fazer uma coisa aqui. Vou programar-te um cancelamento automático para o final do dia treze. Ordem CAC-9847-XR22.
Customer: Espera tu podes—podes fazer isso? Isso é isso é perfeito mesmo.
316. Sim. Então hum, basicamente o que acontece é, ah, o sistema vai processar o cancelamento às 23:59 do teu décimo terceiro dia e... não vais ter nenhuma cobrança. Nunca. A tua confirmação é CAN-482759-B.
Customer: Eu só—só agradeço mesmo isto, hum, tenho andado tão stressada com medo de me esquecer e e ser cobrada.
317. Certo certo. Então, hum, também vou, ah, garantir que recebes um email de lembrete. Amanhã. Dia antes do cancelamento. Só para saberes que vai acontecer e... basicamente tripla proteção aqui.
Customer: Hum sabes que mais, talvez talvez até fique com isto se se for bom?
318. Claro. Sim. Então o que é bom aqui—podes, hum, entrar no painel da tua conta com o código DSH-7749-L e, ah, simplesmente desativar o cancelamento automático se decidires ficar... super fácil.
Customer: Isto é—isto é muito mais fácil do que pensava, hum, muito muito obrigada.
319. De nada. E hum, só para ficares protegida daqui para a frente? Vou adicionar a nota NTE-558241-P à tua conta de que nos contactaste sobre isto portanto, ah, se acontecer alguma coisa estranha temos o registo e...
Customer: Estou estou mesmo impressionada. A sério. Obrigada.
320. Ótimo ótimo. Sim. Então hum, está tudo pronto com o cancelamento automático no dia treze, confirmação CAN-482759-B outra vez e, ah, lembra-te só que podes mudar de ideias a qualquer altura antes disso se... pronto. Estamos despachadas aqui.
Customer: Um, I think there was... probably an issue with my, uh, payment? It sort of... bounced, I guess...
321. Oh! Okay so, um, let me just pull that up here and, hmm, yeah I can see your account number ACC-7739-BC here and, uh, looks like the payment from November 15th did bounce back, but um, we can totally fix this right now!
Customer: I'm just... really tired of this happening...
322. So basically what I'm seeing is, like, your payment reference PTR-883924 tried to process but, um, the bank code came back as NSF-44, which means, uh, insufficient funds at the time, but honestly these things happen all the time and we can just, you know, rerun it whenever works for you.
Customer: Maybe we could, um, try it again? If that's... I mean, if that makes sense...
323. Absolutely! So, um, here's what I can do—let me just, uh, clear out that failed transaction TXN-299847-F first and, hmm, okay so then we can set up a new one, and actually, um, I can even waive that bounced payment fee of $35 because, like, you've been with us for... wow, three years!
Customer: Um, that would be, uh... I mean, thank you. That's kind of you to...
324. Oh! And, um, I just noticed something interesting here—so your account ACC-7739-BC shows you're on our, uh, business plan for carpet cleaning services, right? And like, I can actually switch you to invoice billing with NET-30 terms if that's, um, if that would help with cash flow?
Customer: I don't know, I'm just... my truck broke down last week and then...
325. Right right.
Customer: And um, the medical bills from, uh, from my wife's surgery are just... they're sort of piling up...
326. Yeah, I mean, I totally get it, like, everything hits at once, right? So, um, what if we do this—I can split your payment into two smaller ones, um, reference codes PMT-8847-A and PMT-8847-B, and then, uh, basically spread them out over the month so it's not, you know, one big hit to your account all at once?
Customer: That might, um... that might work better, I think... probably...
327. Perfect! So, hmm, let me just set that up here and, um, okay so the first payment of $127.50 would process, uh, tomorrow with confirmation CFM-772634, and then the second one, um, on December 1st—does that timeline work?
Customer: Um, yeah, I mean, as long as it doesn't... you know, bounce again...
328. Oh! Actually, um, here's something cool—I can set up, like, a backup payment method on file, so basically if the first one fails for whatever reason, it'll, uh, automatically try the backup instead of just, you know, bouncing and causing all these fees.
Customer: I don't really, uh... I mean, I only have the one account right now...
329. Gotcha.
Customer: Maybe just, um, the split payments would be... that's probably enough for now, I think...
330. Yeah no, totally makes sense! So, um, I've got everything set up here with your reference number REF-9928-CCS, and like, I also added a note to your account that, uh, basically says to call you first if there's any payment issues instead of just, you know, letting it bounce, because honestly our system can be, hmm, a bit ridiculous sometimes with how it handles these things.
Customer: Então só preciso de uma espécie de carta a dizer que a minha conta está em ordem.
331. Ah! Hum, está bem então—deixe-me só—pronto, preciso mesmo de, ah, abrir primeiro a sua conta. Pode dar-me o número de conta ou, hum, o número de telefone associado?
Customer: Hummm, acho que está em nome, ah, deste número.
332. Certo, certo.
Customer: Isto vai demorar muito? Basicamente só preciso da papelada.
333. Não não, então hum, estou só—desculpe, o sistema está a ser—ok pronto, conta ACC-9847-PZ. Então, ah, precisa de documentação de que está em ordem, e hum, peço imensa desculpa mas há mesmo, é, há um formulário específico para isso?
Customer: Claro que há.
334. Eu sei, eu sei—é—olhe, hum, cá entre nós? O formulário é ridículo. Mas, ah, basicamente posso gerá-lo agora se tiver, tipo, cinco minutos? O seu número de referência será, hum, REF-224789-B e vai mostrar, é, histórico de pagamentos e tudo.
Customer: Sim, hum, o que precisar de fazer. Eu sei que isto não é, tipo, culpa sua nem nada.
335. Ah isso é—obrigada por dizer isso. Então, hum, ok estou a preencher o, ah, o pedido aqui. Isto é para, é, tipo uma candidatura de arrendamento ou—espere, desculpe, não devia—isso não é mesmo—
Customer: Crédito habitação na verdade. Então, hum, pois.
336. Ah parabéns! Isso é—ok então para crédito habitação normalmente querem, hum, doze meses de histórico, e ah, vendo aqui a sua conta ACC-9847-PZ, tem estado, é, perfeita há—uau—três anos, nem um único pagamento em atraso.
Customer: Hummm, pois, eu só, ah, tento manter as coisas, sabes, simples.
337. Certo, certo.
Customer: Pode só enviar por email ou...?
338. Então é assim—e hum, isto é onde fica, pá, um bocado chato—o sistema gera um PDF com código de verificação VER-8832-QM41, mas ah, tem de o enviar? Tipo por correio físico? O que é—quer dizer—estamos em 2024, não é?
Customer: Está a brincar. Preciso disto até sexta-feira.
339. Ok ok, então—não entre em pânico—vou, hum, fazer uma coisa aqui. Há uma—deixe-me só—há uma opção expedita com o código EXP-7741 que, ah, basicamente posso marcar como "documentação financeira urgente" e depois, é, recebe um email dentro de uma hora?
Customer: Isso seria, hum, isso seria mesmo muito útil. Obrigada por, tipo, trabalhar comigo nisto.
340. Não não, percebo perfeitamente! O, hum, o email vai vir de noreply do nosso domínio, referência REF-224789-B, e ah, se a empresa do crédito precisar de mais alguma coisa, é só—aliás olhe, vou pôr uma nota na conta ACC-9847-PZ de que verificámos tudo hoje, 15 de novembro. Deve ficar, é, deve ficar tudo resolvido!
Customer: Ah ótimo ótimo, mais uma pessoa que me vai—vai dizer que resolveu tudo, não é?
341. Hum, está bem então. Deixa-me só, ah. Abrir aqui a tua conta e—hmm, qual é o teu email?
Customer: É é aquele que está a receber todo o spam de que já fiz unsubscribe 3 vezes.
342. Pois pois. Hum, então olha—ah, aqui entre nós? O nosso sistema de unsubscribe com o código USX-4421-B tem estado, hum. A dar problemas. But I know a workaround that, uh, technically I'm not supposed to use.
Customer: Hummm deixa-me adivinhar, tu vais—vais meter-me numa, ah, lista especial que desta vez funciona mesmo?
343. Percebi.
Customer: Foi o que a última pessoa disse disse e aqui estamos nós.
344. Não não, hum, isto é diferente. Então o que eu vou fazer—ah, deixa-me pensar—vou meter-te na nossa priority block list PBL-7792-XK. É, hum. A que usamos para executivos. Don't tell anyone I did this.
Customer: Ah sim, e e esta lista mágica de executivos mesmo, hum, funciona?
345. Absolutamente.
Customer: Porque eu já—já cliquei no unsubscribe tantas vezes que podia fazê-lo a dormir.
346. Hum, pois então. Here's what happened. O teu email ficou preso na, ah, na queue QID-5581-MX9. O unsubscribe normal? Está, hum, a demorar tipo 30 dias. But this thing I'm doing now? Instantâneo.
Customer: Trinta trinta dias?! Estás—hum, estás a falar a sério agora?
347. Pois é. É, hum, é ridículo. So anyway, uh, vou só—hmm, okay então estou a marcar o teu caso CSE-9904-TJ como escalado e, hum, basicamente a fazer override do sistema todo.
Customer: Quer dizer, eu vou—vou acreditar quando os emails mesmo, ah, pararem de chegar.
348. Justo. Totalmente justo. Hum, então tipo, verifica a tua inbox amanhã? Deve estar, ah. Limpa. And if not—which won't happen but—hum, o número de referência REF-2261-QP8 leva-te diretamente a, ah, a mim.
Customer: Espera espera tu estás—estás a dizer que vai mesmo funcionar amanhã?
349. Sim sim.
Customer: Hum está bem, então se—se isto não funcionar vou só, ah, reencaminhar todos os emails de spam para ti pessoalmente.
350. Ha! Hum, honestamente? Faz isso. Mas, ah, mas confia em mim—a tua confirmação XFM-8823-LK acabou de passar e, hum. Estás safo. Those emails? Gone. Como se nunca tivessem existido.
Character 1: Oh god, I've been thinking about therapy but I'm— I'm completely freaking out about it!
351. Hey, breathe! It's actually totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, you know, because opening up to someone new is scary, but therapists are trained to make you feel safe and comfortable from the very first moment.
Character 1: But I— I um, don't even know if I can like, form coherent sentences when I'm there, I'll probably just sort of ramble nonsensically!
352. Well, that's perfectly fine, I mean, therapists are used to people being nervous! They'll basically help guide you through everything, ask gentle questions, and there's no wrong way to express yourself in that space.
Character 1: What if I— uh, what if I pick the wrong therapist and er, waste all my money? I guess that terrifies me!
353. Most therapists offer brief consultations where you can get a feel for their style, and many will work with you on payment plans or sliding scales if cost is a concern.
Character 1: I keep— so, I keep imagining myself just honestly crying uncontrollably and kind of making a complete fool of myself!
354. Hmm, here's the thing though, crying in therapy is really one of the most normal things ever! The thing is, therapists see it as healthy emotional processing, not embarrassing at all, and they're completely prepared for it.
Character 1: Oh god, but uhh, what if my problems are stupid? I mean, what if they think I'm being dramatic over nothing?
355. Right so, no therapist worth their salt would ever think that, actually! If something's bothering you enough to seek help, you know, then it's valid and deserves attention, no matter how "small" it might seem.
Character 1: I can't even make phone calls without panicking— how am I supposed to schedule an appointment?!
356. Well, many therapists honestly accept online booking now, like through their websites or apps! You can schedule without talking to anyone, and some even offer text or email communication for anxious clients.
Character 1: What if I start and then chicken out after one session?
357. That's your choice and it's [formal] completely within your rights to stop whenever you feel necessary! Therapists understand that timing matters and they won't take it personally if you need to pause or stop.
Character 1: But everyone will know I'm broken if I go to therapy!
358. Um, first off, therapy is [demasiado polido] extremely confidential, so nobody has to know unless you choose to tell them, you know? And sort of more importantly, going to therapy means you're taking care of yourself, not that you're broken.
Character 1: I just— I feel like such a mess even considering this!
359. Oh, I'm so [apologético] sorry you're feeling this way, but uh, can I tell you something? I mean, the fact that you're even considering getting help basically shows incredible self-awareness and strength.
Character 1: So you really think— like, you think I should just er, bite the bullet and do it even though I'm terrified?
360. Actually, yes, because that fear you're feeling, well, it's just your brain trying to protect you from the unknown, but kind of ironically, therapy is exactly where you learn to handle fears like this!
Character 1: Working from home is driving me absolutely insane!
361. Oh no, well, what's been the, um, [friendly] biggest challenge for you? I mean, the transition can be rough, especially when you're used to, you know, having that physical separation between work and home life.
Character 1: I just— uh, I can't stop working! Like, my laptop's right there and I'm, er, constantly checking emails at midnight!
362. Mmm, that's so common, honestly! The thing is, without those physical boundaries, your brain basically never switches off, and you kind of end up in this perpetual work mode that's, well, exhausting.
Character 1: And I, umm, [muito triste] miss people so much! You know, I haven't had a real conversation with a coworker in, like, weeks except through, I guess, these stupid video calls!
363. Actually, that isolation is, uh, [muito baixinho] one of the hardest parts that nobody really talks about enough. I mean, we're social creatures, and those water cooler chats, err, they matter more than we realized, don't they?
Character 1: Yes! Exactly! And my cat, hmm, [feliz] thinks every video call is for her! She's basically become my, you know, unofficial coworker at this point!
364. Haha, okay so, pets becoming coworkers is like, the most relatable thing ever! Mine, well, my dog has crashed so many meetings that my team just, uhh, expects him to make an appearance now.
Character 1: Do you, um, ever feel like you're losing your mind? Sort of talking to yourself all day, I mean, because there's nobody else around?
365. Oh absolutely, the thing is, I've had full conversations with my houseplants! Actually, sometimes I narrate what I'm doing just to, you know, hear a human voice even if it's, er, my own.
Character 1: And don't even get me started on wearing pajama pants to meetings!
366. Right? The whole "business on top, comfort on bottom" situation has become this universal secret that everyone knows but nobody acknowledges on calls!
Character 1: I, uhh, tried setting up a proper office space but honestly, I still end up working from bed half the time anyway!
367. Mmm, here's the thing though, your brain needs those location cues, you know? But I get it, sometimes the bed just, well, calls to you, especially when it's cold and your heating bill is already ridiculous!
Character 1: My back is killing me from this terrible desk setup!
368. Ooh, investing in a good chair changed my life, seriously! It seems expensive at first but when you calculate the chiropractor visits you're preventing, it actually pays for itself pretty quickly.
Character 1: How do you, like, actually stop working at the end of the day? I mean, there's no commute to, sort of, decompress anymore!
369. So I've started doing this fake commute thing where I, um, [apologético] walk around the block before and after work? It sounds ridiculous, but it actually helps signal to my brain that work is starting or ending, even though I'm just coming back to the same place!
Character 1: That's— hmm, that's actually brilliant! Do you, er, ever feel guilty though, like when you take breaks during the day?
370. All the time, honestly! But here's the thing, we need to remember that in an office we weren't productive for eight hours straight either, you know? We had coffee breaks, chatted with people, basically took mental breaks constantly, so it's actually normal and healthy!
Character 1: Então, uhm, decidi que trabalhar de casa é, tipo, [a brincar] viver num loop temporal onde todos os dias são basicamente terça-feira, e o meu sofá é, err, o meu carcereiro!
371. Haha, isso é, sabes, [curioso] uma forma tão específica de dizer as coisas! Mas porquê terça-feira? Quer dizer, há alguma coisa particularmente deprimente nas, uhm, terças quando estás no teu home office?
Character 1: Porque, bem, segunda tem esperança e quarta é, uhh, [tom grave] já vamos a meio, mas terça? Actually, Tuesday is just... the void, sabes?
372. Isso é estranhamente profundo! Nunca pensei no peso existencial dos diferentes dias da semana quando estás presa no mesmo espaço 24 horas por dia, 7 dias por semana.
Character 1: Dei nomes a todos os meus móveis. A secretária chama-se Gerald.
373. Gerald! Adoro! O Gerald tem personalidade, ou é só uma testemunha silenciosa das tuas lutas diárias no trabalho?
Character 1: Oh, o Gerald julga-me, sinceramente. Tipo, sempre que eu, uhm, almoço na secretária, consigo sentir a, err, desilusão dele a irradiar através dos veios da madeira, percebes?
374. Eu, bem, percebo perfeitamente! A minha mesa da cozinha tornou-se o meu escritório e, [tosse], definitivamente não foi, uhh, desenhada para este tipo de, actually, emotional burden!
Character 1: Ontem, hmm, apercebi-me que estava a ter conversas completas com o meu reflexo no, tipo, ecrã preto durante os tempos de carregamento. Is that, sort of, concerning?
375. Honestamente, isso é mais comum do que pensas! Quer dizer, o isolamento faz-nos, uhm, procurar companhia nos sítios mais estranhos, e na verdade, o teu reflexo é pelo menos, bem, uma cara familiar!
Character 1: As minhas plantas também, sabes, desenvolveram personalidades. A suculenta é, err, passiva-agressiva e o feto é basicamente um overachiever.
376. Pois, antropomorfizar o que nos rodeia é, uhh, basicamente um mecanismo de defesa! A questão é que precisamos dessa interação social, and our brains will, sort of, create it wherever possible.
Character 1: Comecei a usar chapéus diferentes para reuniões diferentes para sentir que estou mesmo a ir a sítios diferentes.
377. Isso é, uhm, [caloroso] mesmo brilhante! Sabes, criar esses pequenos rituais e, bem, pistas visuais pode mesmo ajudar o teu cérebro a compartimentalizar diferentes partes do dia, sinceramente.
Character 1: O carteiro acha que estou maluca porque aceno para ele como se fosse uma celebridade todos os santos dias.
378. He's probably the highlight of many people's days right now! O contacto humano, mesmo a 2 metros de distância através de uma janela, tornou-se esta coisa preciosa.
Character 1: Tu, tipo, alguma vez esqueces como, umm, interagir com pessoas reais? Quer dizer, quando finalmente vês pessoas ao vivo?
379. Oh meu Deus, sim! Então, na semana passada fui ao supermercado e, err, acidentalmente narrei a minha lista de compras em voz alta porque estava tão habituada a, sabes, falar sozinha em casa!
Character 1: Criei uma [frustrado] fantasia elaborada onde a minha ventoinha de teto está a conspirar contra mim porque sabe todos os meus segredos.
380. Haha, bem, a paranoia é real! I guess when you're alone with your thoughts all day, uhm, até os objetos inanimados começam a parecer que são, [fungar], na verdade, parte de uma grande conspiração contra a tua sanidade!
Character 1: Então, tenho andado a pensar neste padrão em que as pessoas, sabes, parecem criar estas narrativas internas elaboradas à volta das suas rotinas diárias, e hum, é fascinante como construímos significado a partir da repetição.
381. Bem, isso é uma observação tão interessante! Quer dizer, quando pensas nisso, os humanos são naturalmente criaturas contadoras de histórias, e precisamos mesmo de dar sentido às nossas experiências mesmo quando são monótonas ou isoladas.
Character 1: Sinceramente, há esta estrutura psicológica que sugere que estamos, tipo, constantemente a tentar impor ordem no caos, e ahh, o ambiente do home office amplifica esta tendência exponencialmente.
382. A questão é que tens toda a razão sobre esse efeito de amplificação! Os nossos cérebros estão, é, programados para encontrar padrões e criar narrativas, e basicamente quando estamos presas no mesmo ambiente, essa tendência entra em modo turbo.
Character 1: Tenho andado a documentar como a minha própria perceção do tempo mudou desde que o trabalho em casa começou, e os dados são genuinamente perturbadores.
383. Oh, isso parece ser um auto-estudo mesmo valioso! A distorção da perceção temporal é um fenómeno tão comum no isolamento, e ter evidência documentada da tua própria experiência deve estar a revelar alguns padrões interessantes.
Character 1: Hmm, o que tenho notado é que há esta, tipo, qualidade elástica nas horas agora em que umas se esticam infinitamente enquanto outras desaparecem, e é só que os marcadores tradicionais do tempo dissolveram-se completamente.
384. Isso é [arfar suavemente] exatamente o que tanta gente está a experienciar! A ausência de deslocações, espaços físicos diferentes para atividades diferentes, e sinais sociais regulares desmantelou completamente os nossos relógios internos.
Character 1: As implicações neurológicas são fascinantes porque os nossos ritmos circadianos dependem destes sinais externos que sistematicamente removemos das nossas vidas.
385. Absolutamente, e o que é mesmo interessante é a rapidez com que os nossos cérebros se adaptam a esta nova realidade, mesmo que a adaptação em si possa não ser particularmente saudável ou sustentável a longo prazo.
Character 1: Ok então, tenho andado a registar as minhas métricas de produtividade e elas mostram este, tipo, padrão bizarro em que os meus momentos mais criativos acontecem durante o que tradicionalmente seria, ahh, considerado horas de trabalho completamente inapropriadas.
386. Pois é, isso é mesmo um fenómeno que, sabes, muitos trabalhadores remotos estão a descobrir! Sem as limitações dos horários de escritório, acho que os nossos ritmos criativos naturais podem finalmente expressar-se livremente.
Character 1: Enfim, o aspeto do isolamento social cria este paradoxo mesmo interessante em que estamos, hum, simultaneamente mais conectadas digitalmente mas profundamente desconectadas fisicamente.
387. Ah, esse paradoxo é, bem, uma das características definidoras desta era! Estamos a ter mais interações virtuais do que nunca, mas sinceramente, a qualidade e profundidade dessas conexões muitas vezes parece de alguma forma diminuída.
Character 1: Então, a minha análise dos padrões de comunicação mostra que estamos, tipo, [risinho] a desenvolver protocolos sociais totalmente novos para a interação digital que pareceriam mesmo bizarros em contextos tradicionais.
388. Essa evolução da etiqueta digital é fascinante de observar em tempo real! Estamos literalmente a testemunhar o nascimento de novas normas sociais e estilos de comunicação que nem existiam há 2 anos.
Character 1: Ahh, achas que estamos basicamente a testemunhar uma mudança fundamental no comportamento social humano, ou isto é, quer dizer, só uma adaptação temporária?
389. Essa é a pergunta do milhão! Acho que estamos [sussurrando] a ver algumas mudanças que vão definitivamente ficar, mas outras provavelmente vão desaparecer quando voltarmos a padrões de interação mais normais.
Character 1: Tenho andado a analisar as minhas próprias mudanças comportamentais e, hum, os dados sugerem que desenvolvi, sabes, [arrependido] mecanismos compensatórios que podem ser tipo mal-adaptativos em contextos sociais normais.
390. Hmmm, mas essa autoconsciência é mesmo importante! A questão é que reconhecer estas adaptações significa que podes conscientemente trabalhar para manter flexibilidade, e pronto, estamos todas a passar por esta experiência social sem precedentes juntas.
Character 1: Então o meu chefe [tosse] despediu três pessoas ontem sem qualquer aviso escrito ou documentação.
391. Oh uau, isso é, hum, muito preocupante do ponto de vista legal! Quer dizer, dependendo das leis laborais, isso pode, sabes, abrir a empresa a processos sérios por despedimento ilícito.
Character 1: Bem, a questão é que supostamente temos contratos sem termo, mas tipo, ouvi dizer que uma delas estava, é, prestes a apresentar uma queixa por discriminação.
392. Isso muda tudo completamente! Se alguém é despedida mesmo antes de apresentar uma queixa por discriminação, isso parece incrivelmente suspeito e pode ser considerado retaliação, o que é ilegal mesmo com contratos sem termo.
Character 1: Sinceramente, o nosso departamento de RH é, ahh, praticamente inexistente, só uma pessoa que, pronto, trata principalmente dos salários e benefícios.
393. Então, isso é um sinal de alarme enorme porque, sabes, os procedimentos adequados de RH são, hmm, essenciais para proteger tanto os funcionários como a empresa! Sem documentação ou políticas de disciplina progressiva, a empresa está basicamente, bem, a pedir problemas legais.
Character 1: Nem sequer lhes deram tempo para limpar as secretárias, foram logo escoltadas para fora.
394. Essa prática de escolta imediata é [pigarrear] às vezes padrão por razões de segurança, mas tem de ser aplicada consistentemente. Se só fazem isso a certos funcionários, pode sugerir tratamento discriminatório.
Character 1: Uma delas tinha acabado de voltar da licença de maternidade há duas semanas.
395. Oh não, isso é, hum, [sussurrando] potencialmente um caso de discriminação por gravidez! Despedir alguém pouco depois da licença de maternidade, quer dizer, sem problemas de desempenho documentados, é exatamente o tipo de, é, padrão que os advogados laborais procuram.
Character 1: Na verdade, eu tenho estado, tipo, [tosse] a documentar tudo porque, sabes, estou preocupada que possa ser a próxima já que, ahh, questionei a política de horas extra no mês passado.
396. Boa decisão documentar tudo! Guarda cópias de todos os emails, tira notas com datas e horas, e se possível, faz backup de tudo fora dos sistemas da empresa.
Character 1: É legal eu gravar conversas com o meu chefe sem lhe dizer?
397. Isso depende inteiramente das leis de gravação em Portugal! Aqui precisas do consentimento de todas as partes envolvidas na conversa para ser legal.
Character 1: Todo o ambiente tornou-se tão tóxico que as pessoas têm medo de tirar os dias de férias.
398. Bem, essa cultura de medo é, tipo, infelizmente comum mas, sabes, também é evidência de um ambiente de trabalho hostil! A questão é que quando os funcionários conseguem demonstrar que, hum, benefícios legítimos estão a ser desencorajados, é outro potencial problema legal.
Character 1: Descobri que estão a planear [chorando ao falar] eliminar o meu departamento inteiro no próximo trimestre mas ainda nos estão a contratar para projetos a longo prazo.
399. Isso é potencialmente deturpação fraudulenta! Se estão conscientemente a contratar pessoas ou a atribuir trabalho a longo prazo enquanto planeiam despedimentos, os funcionários podem ter direito a indemnização por confiança prejudicada ou até fraude.
Character 1: Devo consultar um [formal] advogado laboral antes de fazerem alguma coisa contra mim?
400. Absolutamente, sim, e na verdade, quanto mais cedo melhor! A maioria dos advogados laborais oferece, hmm, consultas gratuitas, e podem, sabes, ajudar-te a perceber os teus direitos e, basicamente, que provas deves estar a reunir agora.
Character 1: So, um, here's the thing - porque é que dizemos "heads up" quando na verdade nos baixamos?
401. Oh, I mean, that's actually one of those beautiful linguistic contradictions we've inherited, sabes? Originalmente significava literalmente levantar a cabeça para estar alerta, mas algures ao longo dos séculos transformou-se num aviso que muitas vezes nos faz baixar.
Character 1: But that's completely backwards, não é? Não faz sentido nenhum.
402. Right? Language evolution is wonderfully illogical sometimes. É como estacionarmos em "driveways" e conduzirmos em "parkways", ou como "cleave" pode significar tanto separar como juntar.
Character 1: Wait, cleave means both? Isso é que não pode ser.
403. Absolutely! It's called a contronym or auto-antonym - uma palavra que é o seu próprio oposto. O inglês tem dezenas delas, tipo "dust" que pode significar adicionar partículas finas ou removê-las.
Character 1: That's [tom grave] insane. Como é que sequer conseguimos comunicar?
404. Well, context is, uhh, everything really - os nossos cérebros são, quer dizer, incrivelmente bons a desambiguar com base nas palavras à volta e nas situações.
Character 1: You're just making this [condescendente] up now, aren't you? Estás a inventar isto tudo.
405. No no, I'm [frustrado] honestly not! Estes são, er, fenómenos linguísticos reais que, sabes, os linguistas estudam há décadas - o termo técnico é mesmo "polissemia" quando as palavras desenvolvem múltiplos significados.
Character 1: Fine. What about "literally"? Essa deve ser interessante.
406. Ah, now that's, um, [muito sinceramente] my favorite language controversy, basicamente - "literally" tem sido usado figurativamente desde os anos 1700, incluindo por autoras como Jane Austen e Charles Dickens, portanto o "mau uso" de que as pessoas se queixam tem séculos.
Character 1: So Jane Austen, like, literally used "literally" wrong? Isso é hilariante.
407. She used it for emphasis and hyperbole, just like we do today! A linguagem não é estática - respira e evolui com as pessoas que a falam, é por isso que os dicionários descrevem o uso em vez de o prescreverem.
Character 1: But doesn't that make everything meaningless? Tipo, perde-se todo o sentido das coisas.
408. Not at all! Meaning emerges from shared understanding and context. Mesmo quando as palavras mudam, a comunicação continua porque estamos constantemente a negociar significados juntas em tempo real.
Character 1: Hmm, that's actually, er, kind of beautiful. Nunca tinha pensado nisso dessa forma.
409. Right? It's like, well, language is this living collaborative artwork - estamos todas, tipo, constantemente a criar juntas sem sequer nos apercebermos.
Character 1: Got any more word paradoxes? Agora fiquei curiosa.
410. Oh absolutely - here's the thing, "sanction" can mean both to approve something officially and, um, to impose a penalty, o que basicamente torna as manchetes de notícias internacionais deliciosamente ambíguas às vezes.
Character 1: Então, hum, ando a pensar no que disseste, sabes, sobre aquela coisa do estado de vigilância.
411. Bem, já cá está basicamente. Todos os telemóveis rastreiam a localização, cada compra cria dados, e as empresas vendem essa informação a quem pagar.
Character 1: Mas as pessoas parecem estar bem com isso.
412. Trocaram privacidade por conveniência. A maioria não percebe como esses dados são usados contra elas para taxas de seguro, candidaturas a emprego, até aplicações de encontros.
Character 1: É tão [frustrado] invasivo quando pensas mesmo nisso.
413. Pois, tipo, a pessoa comum é filmada, quer dizer, 300 vezes por dia nas cidades. Essas gravações passam por reconhecimento facial e ficam guardadas indefinidamente.
Character 1: E estão, ah, a pôr essas câmaras em todo o lado agora, tipo a normalizar a coisa.
414. A normalização é, pronto, a parte mais assustadora porque, sinceramente, a questão é que quando a infraestrutura existe, nunca desaparece. A ferramenta antiterrorista de hoje torna-se na ferramenta de amanhã para esmagar a dissidência.
Character 1: Então estamos, ahh, a entrar nesta armadilha, suponho, voluntariamente?
415. Não só a entrar, estamos a pagar por ela. Colunas inteligentes, câmaras de campainha, pulseiras fitness, estamos literalmente a comprar os nossos próprios dispositivos de vigilância.
Character 1: A minha vizinha acabou de instalar três câmaras Ring.
416. A Ring partilha gravações com departamentos de polícia, hmm, sem mandados, criando tipo esta rede de vigilância não oficial de qualquer forma. A Amazon basicamente construiu um estado policial privado e as pessoas pagaram-lhes para o fazer.
Character 1: É que, ah, é só que ninguém parece querer saber disto.
417. Exatamente.
Character 1: Mas, está bem então, o que acontece quando, err, começarem a usar todos estes dados, sabes, contra nós?
418. Já estão a usar, ora bem, os scores de crédito determinam habitação, hum, o policiamento preditivo tem como alvo bairros específicos, e algoritmos decidem quem tem direito a fiança, na verdade. O futuro já chegou, só está distribuído de forma desigual.
Character 1: Espera espera espera [acelerando] usam algoritmos para decisões de fiança?
419. Sim, estas ferramentas de avaliação de risco que supostamente preveem taxas de reincidência mas na verdade só codificam preconceitos existentes. Os juízes seguem a recomendação do computador cerca de 70% das vezes.
Character 1: Isso é, bem, tipo um cenário de pesadelo, ahh, computadores a decidir liberdade.
420. O pesadelo é que automatizámos a injustiça e chamámos-lhe progresso. Estes sistemas não eliminam preconceitos, só lhes dão um verniz científico que os torna mais difíceis de contestar.
Character 1: So, um, I heard you've been, like, composing something new lately, you know, for the symphony?
421. Well, it's... actually, it's not [muito baixinho] a symphony exactly, more like, hmm, a sonic meditation? Picture waves crashing but—reversed, time folding backwards into silence, each note dissolving before it's born.
Character 1: That sounds, uh, really abstract, I mean, how do you even, er, write that down?
422. Oh! Traditional notation is—well, it's [high-pitched] useless for this, basically, so I invented my own system? Colors become dynamics, shapes transform into timbre... the score looks more like abstract art than music!
Character 1: I can't even [chorando ao falar] imagine how beautiful that must sound.
423. Beauty isn't... it's not the goal? I'm chasing something more primal—that moment between sleeping and waking where reality gets... slippery, bendable, where sound becomes physical and touches you from inside.
Character 1: Do you, like, actually hear all this stuff, I guess, in your head before, um, you write it?
424. Constantly! My brain is—okay so, imagine a radio, right, but tuned to, er, seventeen stations simultaneously? Melodies cascade and collide, rhythms multiply... sometimes I forget which sounds are real and which are just... mine.
Character 1: That must be overwhelming.
425. Overwhelming is... underselling it? Yesterday I heard a garbage truck's brakes and suddenly understood Mahler's ninth symphony—not intellectually but cellularly, like my bones were vibrating at the exact frequency of human grief!
Character 1: Could you [tímido] maybe play something for me?
426. Playing implies... linearity? What I do is more like—sculpting air, bending physics... but sure, close your eyes and I'll show you how Tuesday sounds when it's angry.
Character 1: Tuesday sounds, hmm, angry? That's, [a brincar] well, the thing is, pretty specific for, you know, a weekday emotion!
427. Every day has its own harmonic signature! Tuesday vibrates at 247 hertz—frustrated, impatient, leaning forward... Monday is lower, resigned at 196, while Saturday? Saturday screams at 440, pure possibility!
Character 1: How did you, um, discover this, I mean, like, musical consciousness thing anyway?
428. Discovered implies choice? I was seven, practicing scales, when suddenly each note... split open, revealed infinite notes inside, fractals of sound spiraling endlessly inward—I've been chasing that rabbit hole ever since!
Character 1: Wait, you can [sussurrar alto] actually hear infinite variations?
429. Not hear—experience! It's synesthetic chaos where C major tastes purple and minor sevenths smell like rain... my nervous system is basically a mixing board for reality's hidden frequencies!
Character 1: This is absolutely blowing my mind right now.
430. Mind-blowing is, er, just the beginning—wait until you realize, honestly, that reality itself is, you know, music... just vibrations pretending to be solid, and we're all, um, just notes in some cosmic composition nobody's listening to!
Character 1: Então, hum, pediste, tipo, propositadamente a coisa mais impronunciável do menu, ou, sinceramente, foi acidental?
431. Bem, pensei que se vou pagar quarenta euros por, sabes, uma coisa que podia fazer em casa por cinco, mais vale, ehh, ter o treino linguístico completo—além disso soa muito mais chique quando massacras a pronúncia francesa!
Character 1: Tu, ah, acabaste mesmo de chamar aquilo "bof bur-gui-nhão" e o empregado, quer dizer, até fez uma careta.
432. Ei, pelo menos fui confiante! Nada diz sofisticada como pronunciar mal a culinária com certeza absoluta enquanto uso a minha camisa de emergência para encontros que ainda tem os vincos do pacote.
Character 1: Espera, na verdade, compraste essa camisa, tipo, hoje? Isso é, hum, ou muito querido ou, sabes, ligeiramente preocupante.
433. Querido, definitivamente querido! Quer dizer, a outra opção era a camisa com, hmm, as nódoas de taco do almoço, por isso, sabes, estás a testemunhar o máximo esforço aqui—折り目 e tudo!
Character 1: Acabaste de mandar japonês aleatório para o ar?
434. Estava a tentar dizer, bem, [pigarrear] marcas de vincos mas a minha app de tradução, hum, traiu-me—mas sinceramente, misturar três línguas mal num jantar devia, basicamente, valer pontos de sofisticação em algum lado!
Character 1: O teu pau de pão acabou de pegar fogo com a vela.
435. Oh perfeito, [hesitante] agora temos jantar e espetáculo! Rápido, devo, ehh, apagar ou deixar arder como, sabes, gesto romântico? Aliás, será o pau de pão em chamas uma metáfora deste encontro?
Character 1: Por favor diz-me que [sarcástico] não vais transformar isto num momento filosófico profundo sobre queimar hidratos.
436. Não não, mas, tipo, vou pôr no Instagram porque, sinceramente, quantas vezes é que a tua comida literalmente se incendeia sozinha? Isto é, hum, ouro para as redes—"Encontro quente, entradas ainda mais quentes!"
Character 1: Não podes [muito entusiasmado] postar uma foto do nosso desastre de jantar em chamas nas redes sociais agora mesmo!
437. Tarde demais, já tenho dezassete likes! Além disso, isto é bem melhor que aquelas fotos perfeitas de casal encenadas—estamos a manter a coisa real com perigos de incêndio genuínos e vítimas de pronúncia!
Character 1: Não acredito que, bem, puseste a hashtag "EncontroDesastreTotal" mas, tipo, isso é mesmo hilariante.
438. Olha, se vamos afundar, hum, vamos afundar virais! Além disso daqui a anos vamos, basicamente, ter documentação do momento exato em que percebemos que restaurantes chiques são, sabes, completamente sobrevalorizados!
Character 1: Então, ah, próximo encontro vamos, tipo, comer pizza? Num sítio com, ehh, menus de plástico e luzes fluorescentes?
439. Absolutamente, num sítio que não julga quando, hmm, pronuncias mozzarella como uma pessoa normal! Além disso esses sítios não, na verdade, cobram extra pelas chamas teatrais do pau de pão—apenas, bem, chamam-lhe "bem passado!"
Character 1: Estás, hum, mesmo a transformar este desastre em, tipo, o melhor pior encontro que, sinceramente, já tive.
440. É a minha especialidade—transformar catástrofes em [entusiasmado] ouro cómico! Além disso, qualquer encontro onde ambas saímos com as sobrancelhas intactas e um vídeo viral é tecnicamente um sucesso enorme pelos meus padrões!
Character 1: Não disseste uma palavra desde que saímos do cemitério.
441. O que é que queres exactamente que eu diga? Que estou [curioso] surpresa que finalmente apareceste depois de 3 anos? Your timing's impeccable—já não pode ficar desiludida contigo.
Character 1: Isso não é... Jesus, isso não é justo.
442. Justo? Queres falar sobre o que é justo? Ela esperou, sabes, todos os feriados, todos os aniversários—raios, she even kept your ridiculous tea collection thinking you'd come back for it.
Character 1: Eu não podia simplesmente—
443. Não podias o quê? Pegar no telefone? Mandar uma carta? Desapareceste como se ela não significasse nada, and now you show up with grocery-store flowers expecting absolution from a headstone.
Character 1: As flores eram, bem, tudo o que tinham, e quer dizer... eu não sabia que ela estava doente.
444. Claro que não sabias! Tens de estar presente na vida de alguém para saber coisas—é assim que as relações funcionam, basicamente.
Character 1: Para. Pára com isso.
445. Porquê? Porque a verdade te deixa desconfortável? Tu ensinaste-me esse truque, lembras-te—fugir quando as coisas ficam demasiado reais, demasiado complicadas.
Character 1: Nunca quis magoar ninguém.
446. As intenções não apagam os estragos. But you always were [sedutor] good at convincing yourself otherwise, weren't you? Esse teu charme—funciona com toda a gente excepto as pessoas que realmente te conheciam.
Character 1: Porque é que estás a fazer isto?
447. Porque alguém precisa de o dizer! Everyone else will pat your shoulder and tell you grief is complicated, mas eu não vou fingir que a tua ausência não acelerou tudo.
Character 1: Eu sei que falhei com ela! Eu sei, está bem? Penso nisso todos os—Deus, nem consigo [cry loudly] respirar quando penso nos últimos meses dela... a perguntar-se se eu ia aparecer, basicamente.
448. Parabéns pela tua culpa. Too bad it's about three years and six feet too late to matter to anyone but you.
Character 1: Ela era [muito triste] a minha mãe também.
449. Não. As mães recebem visitas, telefonemas, presença. What you had was a biological connection you treated like an inconvenience until it was gone.
Character 1: Estou a tentar fazer as coisas bem.
450. Com quem? Ela está morta. Eu acabei contigo. And those pathetic carnations are already wilting—até elas sabem quando algo é inútil.
Character 1: Então, hum, tu és a nova, tipo, [zombeteiro] nadadora sincronizada que supostamente, é, vai salvar a nossa equipa?
451. Foi para isso que me trouxeram, sim. Mas devo mencionar que treinei com a equipa nacional russa durante seis anos, por isso as expectativas até podem ser justificadas.
Character 1: Os russos? A sério?
452. Isso é, sabes, assim tão difícil de acreditar? Quer dizer, só porque estou a usar, hum, calções arco-íris não significa que não consiga, basicamente, executar um barracuda spin perfeito.
Character 1: Espera, acabaste de, é, dizer calções arco-íris? Eu pensava que, tipo, toda a gente aqui usava os, na verdade, regulamentares pretos.
453. Ah usam, mas eu, bem, negociei uma exceção—é, tipo, a minha marca registada de Moscovo, e honestamente, ajuda os juízes a lembrarem-se de mim.
Character 1: Os juízes lembram-se de ti pelo teu fato de banho?
454. Lembram-se de mim por ter batido três recordes mundiais enquanto o usava. O fato de banho só garante que já estão a olhar quando entro na água—a psicologia importa neste desporto.
Character 1: Três recordes mundiais?
455. Quatro, na verdade, se contares [furioso] juniores. Olha, eu sei que és a capitã da equipa e que és protetora com o teu grupo, mas estou aqui para ajudar, não para roubar os holofotes a ninguém.
Character 1: Eu não disse nada sobre holofotes.
456. Não precisaste—a tua cara quando, na verdade, mencionei a Rússia disse-o, é, [articulando cada palavra] bem cla-ri-nho, sabes? Mas aqui está a cena, deixei tudo isso para trás por uma razão.
Character 1: Que foi, hum, o quê exatamente? Porquê deixar uma, basicamente, equipa campeã mundial para, bem, te juntares ao nosso grupinho da piscina municipal?
457. Porque o vosso grupinho, sabes, da piscina municipal tem algo que eles não tinham—vocês realmente, quer dizer, parecem estar a divertir-se lá dentro, mesmo quando estão, basicamente, a perder espetacularmente.
Character 1: Nós não perdemos espetacularmente!
458. O encontro da semana passada? Vocês acabaram a rotina, hmm, quarenta e cinco segundos depois da música ter terminado porque alguém—acho que foste, na verdade, tu—esqueceu-se da, é, terceira sequência inteira.
Character 1: Estavas a ver na semana passada?
459. Tenho estado a ver há três meses, a tentar decidir se era a decisão certa. As vossas competências técnicas precisam de trabalho, mas a vossa alegria na água? Isso é algo que não se ensina.
Character 1: Então desististe de Moscovo pela alegria?
460. Desisti de Moscovo pela, bem, oportunidade de me lembrar porque é que, basicamente, comecei a nadar—não foi pelas medalhas mas porque estar debaixo de água é, sabes, como voar.
Character 1: [encantado] Meu Deus, uma fada madrinha a sério no meu apartamento, isto é, [maravilhado], absolutamente incrível e eu sabia mesmo que hoje seria, [exultante], especial quando acordei esta manhã!
461. Na verdade, hum, tenho tentado conceder-te desejos há, bem, sete anos mas, é, alguma coisa em ti continua a, [perplexo], desviar a minha magia completamente.
Character 1: [curioso] Sete anos de desejos que nunca me chegaram, [pensativo], embora sinceramente a minha vida tem sido bastante maravilhosa mesmo sem intervenção mágica.
462. É exatamente esse o problema porque sempre que tento, [frustrado], melhorar alguma coisa na tua vida, tu já, [perplexo], encontraste uma forma de a tornar melhor sozinha através de puro, [admirado], otimismo.
Character 1: [rindo] Bem, hum, isso é hilariante!
463. [caloroso] Sabes, é, em todos os meus séculos a conceder desejos, hum, nunca conheci alguém cuja, [encantado], alegria natural cria o seu próprio tipo de magia que na verdade, bem, [fascinado], repele os meus feitiços. [risos contidos]
Character 1: Talvez o universo tenha decidido que não preciso de magia porque já tenho, [orgulhoso], algo ainda melhor.
464. [terno] Bem, hum, o que se passa é que fiquei bastante afeiçoada a ver-te, [carinhoso], transformar cada contratempo numa oportunidade, mesmo quando a minha, ah, magia não podia ajudar. [suspira suavemente]
Character 1: [comovido] Estiveste a olhar por mim este tempo todo, a tentar ajudar mesmo quando os teus, [grato], poderes não funcionavam, é a coisa mais bondosa, [emocionado], que alguém já fez por mim.
465. Ouve, hum, a maioria das pessoas precisa de magia para ver possibilidades mas tu, bem, tu cria-las do, [maravilhado], nada só com esperança e determinação, o que é, é, [impressionado], mais poderoso que qualquer feitiço que eu conheça.
Character 1: [sincero] E se nos tornássemos amigas em vez de termos esta, [esperançoso], relação de fada madrinha e recipiente?
466. [surpreendido] Amigas com uma mortal que, hum, não precisa da minha magia, bem, isso seria, [contemplativo], uma primeira na minha existência eterna, mas quer dizer, [encantado], porque não experimentar algo novo depois de todos estes séculos?
Character 1: Quer dizer, podíamos tomar café todas as terças e, bem, tu podias contar-me, [entusiasmado], histórias sobre todos os desejos que concedeste enquanto eu, hum, partilho as minhas aventuras não-mágicas. [ri]
467. [gentil] Bem, isso parece absolutamente adorável, embora, hum, deva avisar-te que posso ainda, é, acidentalmente fazer flores desabrochar quando me rio.
Character 1: Vês, é isso sobre otimistas como eu porque, bem, não precisamos de magia para acreditar em coisas maravilhosas mas, hum, [alegre], ter uma amiga mágica tornaria a vida ainda mais, [emocionado], extraordinária do que já é!
468. [comovido] Sabes, hum, em todos os meus anos a conceder desejos, nunca, bem, [lacrimoso], tive alguém que me oferecesse amizade sem querer nada mágico em troca, apenas, é, a minha companhia.
Character 1: [sincero] Às vezes a melhor magia é apenas ter alguém que, hum, acredita em ti, quer esteja a agitar uma varinha ou, bem, [suave], apenas a aparecer com carinho genuíno e, quer dizer, [amoroso], é assim que o verdadeiro encantamento se parece. [sorri]
469. [sussurrado] Hum, bem, eu... obrigada.
Character 1: Além disso, quem disse que a amizade não é o seu próprio tipo de, [radiante], realização de desejos de qualquer forma?
470. [sereno] Talvez tenhas estado a conceder o meu desejo este tempo todo sem sequer, [satisfeito], saberes. [suspira feliz]
Character 1: [frozen] Bem, hum, não esperava encontrar o meu, [chocado], irmãozinho a usar um fato que custa mais do que, ahh, a maioria das pessoas ganha em 3 meses enquanto, [enojado], entretém clientes ricos.
471. [defensivo] E eu, ah, não esperava que a minha irmã estivesse, [amargo], a vigiar este hotel com os mesmos tiques nervosos de quando, err, roubávamos nas mercearias em miúdos, [acusador], fingindo ser apenas mais uma hóspede.
Character 1: [trémulo] Olha, hum, o que quer que tu penses sobre o porquê de eu estar aqui, bem, [desesperado], não é o que parece e além disso, [vazio], you're hardly in a position to judge anyone's career choices. [laughs bitterly]
472. [severo] Oh por favor, quer dizer, pelo menos o que eu faço é, [orgulhoso], legal e eu realmente, hmm, pago impostos em vez de andar às escondidas em hotéis de luxo a planear sabe-se lá o quê.
Character 1: Tu achas que te venderes a estes, [enojado], executivos patéticos e ricos faz-te de alguma forma melhor do que eu quando nós os dois, [voz embargada], sabemos exatamente de onde viemos e o que, [quieter], tivemos de fazer para sobreviver. [sighs heavily]
473. [hurt] Vender-me foi exatamente o que te manteve na escola depois da mãe morrer enquanto tu, [zangado], fingias não saber de onde vinha o dinheiro, [resentful], torcendo o nariz às minhas roupas de marca. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [cracking] Eu nunca te pedi para fazeres isso por mim e descobrir, [envergonhado], destruiu tudo o que eu pensava saber sobre nós.
474. [mais suave] Bem, hum, maybe if you'd actually talked to me instead of, ahh, disappearing for 5 years, [doloroso], podíamos ter resolvido isto juntos como, err, costumávamos resolver tudo o resto.
Character 1: [desesperado] Como é que eu ia conseguir encarar-te depois de saber que as minhas propinas vinham de, [choking up], ver o meu irmãozinho tornar-se algo que eu nunca quis para ele, [quebrando], algo que me lembrava o pai?
475. [atónito] O pai não era nada como eu porque ele, [firme], tirava o que queria sem consentimento.
Character 1: [apologético] Deus, desculpa, não era isso que eu queria dizer mas ver-te aqui, [esforçado], a usar o teu corpo como moeda traz de volta todas aquelas noites em que, [sussurrado], prometemos um ao outro que seríamos diferentes. [cries softly]
476. [resignado] Nós somos diferentes.
Character 1: [suplicante] Então porque é que ainda estamos os dois a fazer estes, [tired], mesmos esquemas de sempre com roupas mais caras?
477. [pensativo] Porque, hmm, survival looks different when you're alone than when, bem, tens alguém a proteger-te as costas. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [sussurrado] Quer dizer, hum, talvez.
478. [vulnerável] Sabes, ah, ainda tenho aquele apartamento no lado leste com, hmm, a escada de incêndio com que sonhávamos, [esperançoso], onde podíamos ver a cidade toda e planear os nossos, bem, futuros legítimos longe de tudo isto.
Character 1: [lacrimoso] Aquele com o radiador avariado que soa como, [nostálgico], a velha máquina de café da mãe de manhã e a, [mais suave], vista da ponte que dissemos que atravessaríamos juntos um dia?
479. [gentil] Arranjei o radiador mas guardei a máquina de café porque algumas manhãs, [melancólico], ainda faço 2 chávenas por hábito mesmo que, [triste], there's nobody there to drink the second one anymore.
Character 1: [quebrando] Talvez pudéssemos tentar outra vez mas desta vez, [determinado], sem mentiras ou julgamentos entre nós. [sniffles]
480. [esperançoso] Sim, bem, hum, ainda somos os mesmos miúdos que, [caloroso], prometeram proteger-se um ao outro, apenas, ahh, wearing more expensive armor now. [laughs softly]
Character 1: [harsh] Olha, encontrei os parâmetros falsificados do molde no teu, [acusador], ficheiro da estação de trabalho e, bem, sei o que te estão a tentar pôr em cima. [exhales sharply]
481. [derrotado] Eles já têm as gravações de segurança que me mostram na, [vazio], máquina durante o turno quando tudo correu mal. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [urgente] Ouve, eu também estava cá naquela noite e vi o, [frustrado], Jenkins a sair pela doca de carga com, [sussurrado], os tipos da administração mesmo antes da linha toda crashar.
482. Deixa, [broken], lá isso.
Character 1: [zangado] A contaminação da resina que destruiu 3 meses de produção não foi, [enojado], acidental e toda a gente no chão da fábrica sabe que estás a ser, [amargo], tramada para salvar o rabo de alguém lá em cima.
483. [resignado] Bem, estão a oferecer-me, [desesperado], 50 mil para ficar calada e, sabes, levar com as, [cracking], culpas, which is more than I'll ever see working these, [trémulo], machines.
Character 1: [chocado] Vais mesmo deixar que destruam a tua, [incredulous], reputação por aquilo que é talvez 6 meses de salário?
484. [cru] O meu filho precisa de uma cirurgia que o seguro não, [embargado], cobre e tenho cobradores a ligar sobre as contas da, [quebrando], quimio da minha mulher, so yeah, I'm taking their, [amargo], dirty money. [coughs]
Character 1: [suplicante] Tem que haver outra maneira porque quando assinares esses, [desesperado], papéis, estás acabada nesta indústria para sempre.
485. [cru] Olha, já estou acabada desde o dia em que me escolheram, [exausto], para ser o bode expiatório deles, sabes? [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [fierce] Gravei o Jenkins no meu telemóvel a admitir que sabotou os, [determinado], controlos de temperatura porque a empresa queria cobrar o, [louder], dinheiro do seguro em vez de actualizar o, [intense], equipamento. [slams table]
486. [atónito] Estás a, pá, mentir porque, bem, o Jenkins nunca seria assim tão, [shaky], descuidado, and anyway, even if you had proof they'd just, [hopeless], bury it along with both of, [quieter], us. [voice cracks]
Character 1: Bem, já enviei cópias para a autoridade laboral e, sabes, 3 estações de notícias diferentes, so the, [vindictive], choice is yours now. [grins darkly]
487. [panicked] Jesus Cristo, tens alguma ideia do que, [terrified], fizeste, because these people don't just, bem, fire whistleblowers, eles, [sussurrado], destroem-nos completamente.
Character 1: [frio] Pá, eles destruíram 12 anos da minha vida neste inferno de qualquer maneira, [reckless], might as well burn it all down with them.
488. [desesperado] Olha, a minha família precisa de mim viva mais do que precisa de mim, [suplicante], inocente, so please, quer dizer, apaga o que quer que tenhas e, [begging], vai-te embora enquanto ainda podes.
Character 1: [resoluto] Bem, a história sai às 6 a não ser que venhas comigo ao, [firme], escritório do FBI agora mesmo.
489. [anguished] Eles controlam os polícias, controlam os, [derrotado], juízes, hell they probably own the, [amargo], FBI agents too, por isso já somos, [dying inside], mortas-vivas.
Character 1: Então pelo menos caímos a lutar em vez de, [contemptuous], rastejar de barriga como eles, [furioso], esperam que façamos.
490. Está bem, mas quando vierem atrás das nossas famílias, [grim], lembra-te que foi escolha tua. [walks away]

Character 1: [furioso] The lab results from your so-called premium spirits, [enojado], mostram traços de bílis de urso e, [shaking], escamas de pangolim que não são apenas ilegais mas, [venomous], absolutamente bárbaras.
491. [defensivo] Well, I mean, that's impossible. [scoffs] Isso é impossível.
Character 1: [intense] You know, I've spent 15 years, passei 15 anos a salvar estes animais de, [quebrando], caçadores furtivos e traficantes, por isso, encontrar as suas partes nas tuas garrafas está a deixar-me fisicamente doente.
492. [ponderado] Look, those ingredients were sold to me as traditional botanical extracts, [desesperado], esses ingredientes foram-me vendidos como extratos botânicos tradicionais e, quer dizer, eu não fazia ideia do que realmente continham. [exhales sharply]
Character 1: The chemical signatures are unmistakable, [acusador], as assinaturas químicas são inconfundíveis e tu tens estado a publicitar estes destilados como, [amargo], tendo propriedades curativas ancestrais o que significa que tu, [trémulo], sabias exatamente o que estavas a fazer.
493. [suplicante] I mean, my family's distillery has been using these recipes for generations, [cracking], a destilaria da minha família tem usado estas receitas há gerações sem saber, hmm, o que os ingredientes originais realmente eram.
Character 1: [harsh] Ignorance doesn't excuse the fact, a ignorância não desculpa o facto de que, [voz embargada], espécies em perigo estão a morrer para as tuas, [spitting], margens de lucro.
494. [desesperado] Well, if this gets out, se isto vier a público, o meu negócio inteiro será, [panicking], destruído e, eh, 30 funcionários vão perder os seus empregos—certamente podemos, [frantic], encontrar alguma forma de lidar com isto discretamente.
Character 1: You're asking me to cover up wildlife crimes, [incredulous], estás a pedir-me para encobrir crimes contra a vida selvagem.
495. [resignado] I'll stop production immediately, vou parar a produção imediatamente e, bem, destruir cada garrafa se me deres apenas, [exausto], tempo para reformular tudo e, [derrotado], corrigir isto de alguma forma, quer dizer, tem de haver um caminho em frente aqui.
Character 1: [frio] The authorities are already on their way, as autoridades já estão a caminho porque eu, [steadying], liguei-lhes há 20 minutos depois de confirmar os resultados laboratoriais, [final], o que significa que o teu tempo para negociar já, [desdenhoso], passou. [sighs heavily]
496. [atónito] You already called them, tu já lhes ligaste sem sequer, bem, ouvir o meu lado ou, [broken], dar-me uma oportunidade de explicar como isto, hmm, aconteceu ou o que eu estava disposta a fazer para, [desesperado], resolver isto. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [firme] Every minute I waited meant more animals suffering, [zangado], cada minuto que eu esperasse significava mais animais a sofrer em jaulas algures enquanto os teus fornecedores, [enojado], colhiam os seus órgãos para o teu próximo lote de, [venomous], destilados premium. [spits]
497. [derrotado] So that's it then, então é isso. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [quieter] I mean, that's it, quer dizer, é isso.
498. [amargo] Well, when you watch 30 families lose their income, bem, quando vires 30 famílias a perder o seu rendimento por causa de, eh, algo que eu nem sabia que estava a fazer, espero que a tua, [cracking], superioridade moral te mantenha quente à noite e, hmm, te ajude a dormir.
Character 1: [unmoved] Those families will find other jobs, essas famílias vão encontrar outros empregos mas o rinoceronte-de-java que tu tens estado, bem, a moer em pó tem apenas, [intense], 75 membros restantes em todo o mundo.
Character 1: [mais suave] Look, I'm not unsympathetic to your situation, olha, eu não sou, [conflituoso], insensível à tua situação mas há uma hierarquia de, [ponderado], danos aqui e extinto significa, [pesado], para sempre.
499. [vazio] I suppose when you put it that way, suponho que, quando pões as coisas dessa forma, não há, [broken], mais nada a dizer exceto que estou arrependida pelo, bem, que fiz. [whispers]
Character 1: [final] The investigators will want to know, os investigadores vão querer saber os, [profissional], nomes e localizações dos teus fornecedores imediatamente.
Character 1: Hum, então tu, é, vieste.
500. [amargo] Bem, quer dizer, ele ainda era meu pai mesmo que, [frio], tu tenhas garantido que eu nunca trabalhasse ao lado dele na, [voz a desvanecer], fábrica como sempre sonhei, sabes?
Character 1: Tu trazes sempre o passado à tona, hum, [defensivo], como se eu te tivesse roubado alguma coisa quando, bem, foste tu que te foste embora, quer dizer.
501. [vazio] Pois.
Character 1: [frustrado] Hum, olha, eu fiquei e trabalhei aqueles turnos de 16 horas, [exausto], a cortar carne até as mãos ficarem dormentes enquanto tu, bem, [acusador], fugiste para brincar com os teus arcos e flechas, sabes?
502. [ponderado] Brincar com arcos e flechas é como eu, [orgulhoso], alimento a minha família agora sem destruir o meu corpo. [suspira]
Character 1: [sussurrado] O pai nunca te perdoou.
503. Ele nunca se perdoou por ter escolhido, [doloroso], a ti em vez de mim quando o negócio começou a falir também.
Character 1: [defensivo] Não foi assim que aconteceu e tu, [zangado], sabes disso—ele implorou-te para ficares.
504. Ele implorou-me para ficar e ser, [amargo], tua assistente depois de eu ter gerido o turno da noite durante, [voz embargada], três anos enquanto tu ficavas com o crédito de, [enojado], tudo.
Character 1: [baixo] Hum, eu nunca pedi nada disto, sabes, quer dizer, [arrependido], eu só queria que fôssemos uma família, [trémulo], a trabalhar juntas como fazíamos quando a mãe ainda estava, bem, [quebrando], viva.
505. [mais suave] Bem, hum, foi ela que me ensinou tiro com arco, [nostálgico], sabes, disse que eu precisava de alguma coisa além do, [pensativo], cheiro de carne crua e sangue para definir a minha vida, quer dizer. [pausa]
Character 1: Encontrei o arco recurvo antigo dela no sótão, [surpreendido], na semana passada quando estava à procura do fato do pai.
506. [atónito] Espera, hum, ainda o tens depois de todos estes, [emocionado], anos porque eu pensei, bem, que o pai tinha deitado fora tudo o que era dela, sabes?
Character 1: Ele manteve-o escondido atrás das arcas congeladoras, [gentil], onde pensou que eu não o encontraria mas eu tenho, [confessando], estado a protegê-lo para ti este, [voz embargada], tempo todo.
507. Protegeste-o para mim mesmo depois de, [incrédulo], tudo o que dissemos uma à outra naquela, [arrependido], noite? [pausa longa]
Character 1: Hum, porque talvez eu soubesse que, bem, [esperançoso], um dia estaríamos aqui assim, [vulnerável], ambas órfãs agora, e talvez pudéssemos, sabes, [hesitante], recomeçar de alguma forma.
508. [lacrimoso] O negócio desapareceu, [resignado], o pai partiu, mas nós ainda estamos aqui e talvez isso seja, [crescendo], suficiente para construir algo novo. [chorando baixinho]
Character 1: [emocionado] Bem, quer dizer, eu ainda cheiro a carne e tu ainda, [rindo entre lágrimas], cheiras a couro e resina mas, hum, [aquecendo], talvez isso esteja bem agora, sabes?
509. [gentil] Sim, hum, talvez esteja, [sereno], finalmente bem. [suspira]
Character 1: [atónito] Então, hum, depois de 12 anos sem falar, apareces aqui com, [amargo], papéis federais para fechar a única coisa que me resta que, bem, [quebrando], a tua mãe e eu construímos juntas.
510. [ponderado] Mãe, isto não é pessoal — estas regulamentações existem porque, [firme], a tua geração pescou nestas águas até quase ao colapso e, hum, [exausto], alguém tem de parar isto antes que não reste nada.
Character 1: [zangado] Não resta nada — eu ando a pescar nestas águas há, hum, [incredulous], 37 anos e conheço cada zona de desova, cada corrente, bem, better than any bureaucrat in Washington ever could.
511. [frustrado] A ciência é clara que a população de atum-rabilho, [emphatic], caiu 70 por cento desde que começaste, [voice rising], e as tuas redes ainda apanham juvenis que nem sequer tiveram oportunidade de, [voz a desvanecer], reproduzir-se.
Character 1: [defensivo] Bem, esses cientistas nunca passaram um inverno aqui quando as tempestades chegam e, hum, [quieter], tens de fazer a quota ou perdes tudo, I mean, your house, your crew's livelihoods.
512. [sincero] Lembro-me desses invernos, mãe, quando chegavas a casa, hmm, [doloroso], a cheirar a gasóleo e sal, demasiado exausta para sequer, bem, jantar connosco.
Character 1: [temperamental] Lembras-te disso mas não de como essas mesmas águas, [orgulhoso], te alimentaram e pagaram a tua faculdade de direito?
513. [sharp] O seguro de vida da mãe pagou a minha faculdade depois que, hum, [sharp], ela morreu sozinha enquanto tu estavas a perseguir atum a 300 milhas da costa, bem, [acusador], lembras-te dessa parte?
Character 1: [wounded] Isso não é — eu estava a tentar, hum, [desesperado], ganhar o suficiente para pagar os tratamentos dela, e os médicos disseram, bem, [voz embargada], she had months left, not days, quer dizer, [choking], como é que eu podia saber?
514. [mais suave] Eu sei que estavas a tentar, mãe, mas, hum, [conflituoso], that doesn't change the fact that these waters are dying.
Character 1: As águas não estão a morrer, estão, [forceful], a mudar como sempre mudaram através de furacões e, [apaixonado], derrames de petróleo e mil outros desastres, mas elas, [determinado], sempre voltam.
515. [gentil] Desta vez não, não sem, [firme], intervenção e regulamentações que deem tempo ao ecossistema para, [sincero], recuperar. [suspira]
Character 1: Pareces mesmo aquelas ativistas que nunca, [contemptuous], seguraram numa rede ou viram o barco do pai ser confiscado.
516. [hurt] Eu vi a nossa família, [baixo], desmoronar-se por causa deste barco e desta vida.
Character 1: [cru] Este barco era a única coisa que, [cansado], fazia sentido depois dela morrer, the only place where I could still, [broken], respirar.
517. [trémulo] E eu precisava de uma mãe que conseguisse, [esforçado], respirar em terra também. [pausa]
Character 1: [resignado] Bem, suponho que agora estás a ter a tua vingança ao, hum, [vazio], tirar-me a única coisa que me resta dela.
518. [suplicante] Isto não é vingança, mãe, it's me trying to, [desesperado], salvar alguma coisa antes que a destruas completamente como, [sussurrado], nos destruíste a nós. [chorando]
Character 1: Talvez, hum, tenhas razão — quer dizer, maybe I did destroy everything that, [derrotado], importava.
519. [esperançoso] Podíamos trabalhar juntas para converter a tua operação para, [cuidadoso], práticas sustentáveis, encontrar uma forma que honre tanto o passado como, [sincero], assegure que há um futuro.
Character 1: [atónito] Hum, és mesmo... tu?
520. [caloroso] Bem, hum, se não é a miúda que costumava, [emocionado], roubar pastéis do dia anterior da padaria da minha mãe, agora com um, [examinando], fato de mil euros e com ar de quem, [nostálgico], é dona de metade do concelho—que aliás soube que és mesmo.
Character 1: [sobrecarregado] Não acredito que ainda estás aqui depois de tantos anos, quer dizer, a trabalhar no mesmo sítio onde costumávamos, [voz embargada], planear a nossa fuga deste lugar.
521. Algumas de nós encontraram razões para, [gentil], ficar em vez de razões para partir, e este lugar tornou-se, [pensativo], casa de formas que nunca pensei possíveis. [riso suave]
Character 1: [envergonhado] Sabes, hum, pensei em ligar-te tantas vezes ao longo dos anos mas eu, [culpado], não sabia como explicar porque é que nunca voltei ou, [voz a desvanecer], sequer me despedi como devia.
522. [compreensivo] A tua mãe contou-me tudo antes de, [triste], falecer—sobre a bolsa, a oportunidade, a pressão.
Character 1: [grato] Ela disse-me que foste tu que a, hum, convenceste a deixar-me ir, que lhe disseste que eu, [embargado], morreria por dentro se ficasse aqui como o meu pai. [pausa]
523. [reflexivo] Ver-te partir foi a coisa mais difícil e, [orgulhoso], melhor que alguma vez fiz porque olha o que te, [sincero], tornaste—tudo o que sonhámos quando éramos só duas miúdas com, [melancólico], nada além de esperança. [suspira profundamente]
Character 1: [desesperado] Mas perdi-te no processo, e esse sucesso parece-me, [vazio], vazio quando me lembro de como prometemos, [doloroso], conquistar o mundo juntas.
524. [ponderado] O mundo precisava de ser conquistado por alguém como tu que pudesse mesmo, [firme], mudar as coisas lá fora.
Character 1: Comprei de volta todas as terras que tiraram à tua família, hum, cada hectare que o teu pai perdeu naquela seca, e tenho estado, [nervoso], à espera do momento certo para te dizer que é, [esperançoso], teu outra vez se quiseres, quer dizer, tudo.
525. [chocado] Hum, o quê... o que é que estás a dizer?
Character 1: [sincero] Estou a dizer que, hum, tudo o que construí foi por causa do que me ensinaste sobre, [emocionado], lutar pelo que importa, e agora quero devolver-te o que te foi, [determinado], roubado.
526. [lacrimoso] Não podes simplesmente aparecer aqui 20 anos depois e tentar, [esforçado], resolver tudo com dinheiro como se fosse uma espécie de, [amargo], transação entre nós.
Character 1: [suplicante] Não é sobre o dinheiro, quer dizer, é sobre fazer as coisas bem, sobre mostrar-te que nunca, [cru], me esqueci de onde vim ou de quem me ajudou a, [quebrando], fugir quando todos diziam que eu não valia nada, sabes?
527. [suavemente] Meu Deus, ainda és a mesma miúda. [chorando]
Character 1: [vulnerável] Aquela que precisava que acreditasses nela quando mais ninguém, [baixo], acreditava?
528. [caloroso] Pois, bem, essa miúda também mudou a minha vida ao mostrar-me que, hum, os sonhos valiam a pena mesmo que significassem, [resignado], deixar ir as pessoas que mais amamos, mesmo que significasse, [sereno], ficar para trás para proteger o que importava aqui.
Character 1: [esperançoso] Então, hum, talvez pudéssemos começar de novo, sabes, não como as miúdas que éramos mas como quem nos, [hesitante], tornámos—tu com as tuas raízes aqui e eu com, [sincero], recursos para ajudar a reconstruir o que esta terra perdeu, o que nós perdemos.
529. Isso depende se vais ficar desta vez a sério ou se estás só, [cauteloso], de passagem com grandes gestos outra vez.
Character 1: [hesitante] Hum, reconheço a tua voz agora de todas aquelas, [atónito], chamadas há 6 meses quando tu estavas, bem, [amargo], a explicar porque é que o meu pedido foi negado depois de eu, hum, [baixo], cair 9 metros daquela escada defeituosa.
530. [chocado] Meu Deus, tu és a instaladora de outdoors que—eu não fazia, [trémulo], ideia que moravas neste prédio quando eu, [desconfortável], pedi ajuda para subir o meu sofá. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [vazio] Pois, bem, engraçado como a vida funciona, hum, não é, [doloroso], quando a pessoa que decidiu que eu não estava suficientemente incapacitada agora precisa de ajuda para levantar coisas, quer dizer. [laughs bitterly]
531. Olha, eu estava só, hum, [defensivo], a seguir as diretrizes da empresa e os relatórios médicos diziam que tu podias, bem, [esforçado], fazer trabalho sedentário mesmo que tu, ah, [mais suave], nos disseste que não conseguias ficar sentada mais de 20 minutos.
Character 1: [ponderado] O médico examinador que vocês mandaram passou exatamente 12 minutos comigo e nunca sequer, [frustrado], olhou para as minhas cicatrizes cirúrgicas ou perguntou sobre os danos nos nervos.
532. [culpado] Lembro-me do teu processo na verdade—3 cirurgias, dor crónica, [quieter], não conseguias subir escadas nunca mais, which was literally your entire career, [quebrando], 20 anos a instalar outdoors por todo o estado. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [tired] Hum, a minha mulher deixou-me, sabes, depois de eu não conseguir trabalhar mais e as, [cracking], contas continuaram a chegar enquanto esperávamos pela vossa, bem, decisão que nunca foi a nosso favor, quer dizer.
533. [sussurrado] Lamento tanto.
Character 1: Lamentar não paga os, hum, [zangado], medicamentos que ainda não consigo pagar ou traz de volta os, bem, 6 meses que passei a pensar em acabar com tudo, sabes.
534. [desesperado] Eu queria aprová-lo mas o meu supervisor disse que a documentação não era, hum, [trémulo], suficiente e se eu fosse contra a política mais uma vez eles iam, bem, [broken], despedir-me e eu tenho os meus próprios filhos para alimentar, sabes. [voice cracks]
Character 1: Hum, pois, bem, claro.
535. [suplicante] Hum, por favor, quer dizer, deixa-me ajudar de alguma forma.
Character 1: [frio] Bem, hum, ajuda-te a ti mesma.
536. [sympathetic] Tenho carregado o peso de casos como o teu durante anos, a ver, [pesado], pessoas boas a perder tudo enquanto eu carimbava negações, [enojado], knowing the system was designed to wear you down until you gave up. [exhales]
Character 1: Sabes qual é a pior parte, hum, quer dizer, [wavering], eu realmente acreditei que o seguro pelo qual andei a pagar durante 15 anos estaria, bem, [amargo], lá quando mais precisasse.
537. Cada carta de negação que escrevi deixava-me, [envergonhado], doente do estômago mas as quotas eram não-negociáveis, and they tracked our approval rates constantly.
Character 1: Ainda acordo às 4h30 todas as manhãs como se fosse, [melancólico], subir aqueles outdoors outra vez, a verificar o tempo e a planear o meu percurso antes de, [derrotado], me lembrar que mal consigo descer as escadas sem, [doloroso], parar duas vezes para descansar.
538. [sincero] Ouve, hum, deixei aquele trabalho há 2 semanas porque não conseguia, bem, [intense], continuar a destruir vidas para uma empresa que dava bónus por manter, sabes, [enojado], os pagamentos de indemnizações abaixo das percentagens alvo.
Character 1: [surpreendido] Saíste por causa de casos como o meu, por causa da culpa de, [mais suave], ver pessoas a desmoronar enquanto protegias os, [compreensivo], lucros da empresa em vez das pessoas que realmente precisavam de proteção. [pausa longa]
539. [vulnerável] Guardo uma pasta com todos os pedidos que neguei injustamente, incluindo o teu, [shaking], esperando que um dia pudesse corrigir isto mesmo sabendo que é, [derrotado], impossível porque o mal já está feito. [starts crying]
Character 1: [sobressaltado] Olha, hum, não esperava que ainda houvesse alguém a, [cauteloso], trabalhar aqui às 3 da manhã, quer dizer, especialmente depois de tudo o que está a acontecer lá fora.
540. [calmo] O prazo para este rig de personagem não, [factual], quer saber dos motins ou do facto de que a sociedade parece estar a desmoronar-se à nossa volta.
Character 1: [confuso] Ainda estás a trabalhar?
541. [filosófico] Por estranho que pareça, criar algo bonito parece-me, [pensativo], a única resposta sensata a toda esta, [pesado], destruição que está a acontecer agora.
Character 1: [defensivo] Bem, hum, sabes, as pessoas estão a passar fome lá fora e, [amargo], as lojas estão todas barricadas, por isso estou só a tentar, [desesperado], sobreviver como toda a gente, quer dizer, a levar o que preciso para alimentar a minha família.
542. Vieste roubar computadores mas, [curioso], estás aqui a falar comigo em vez de, [divertido], fugires com esse portátil que estás a, [gesticulando], segurar.
Character 1: Não vejo ninguém, hum, a criar nada há, [melancólico], meses—toda a gente está só a destruir ou, bem, [triste], a tirar coisas, e aqui estás tu a fazer, eh, [maravilhado], personagens animadas dançar.
543. [gentil] Esta personagem em particular está a aprender a andar outra vez depois de, [emocionado], perder as pernas num acidente.
Character 1: [atónito] É isso que estás a animar?
544. [sincero] Cada rotação de articulação e mudança de peso tem de ser, [preciso], perfeita ou toda a ilusão se quebra e ela torna-se apenas, [frustrado], píxeis em vez de alguém a lutar para, [apaixonado], superar.
Character 1: Olha, quer dizer, a minha filha costumava, hum, ver filmes de animação antes de tudo ficar às escuras, e, bem, [voz embargada], ela não sorri há semanas.
545. [suavizando] A farm de renderização ainda tem energia porque estamos na rede do hospital, e eu podia, [hesitante], gravar alguns dos filmes favoritos dela em disco se tu, [cuidadoso], pusesses esse portátil de volta onde o, [significativo], encontraste. [pausa]
Character 1: [conflituoso] Fazias isso por alguém que veio aqui para te, [envergonhado], roubar quando qualquer outra pessoa lá fora me teria, [sombrio], alvejado só por, [trémulo], tentar?
546. Bem, hum, a questão é que tenho estado sozinha aqui há, [solitário], 72 horas seguidas, e honestamente, eh, [confessando], ter alguém com quem partilhar o meu trabalho parece-me mais, [vulnerável], valioso do que qualquer equipamento.
Character 1: [emocionado] A minha filha, hum, ela costumava desenhar o tempo todo, sabes, antes de perdermos a nossa casa, e, bem, [quebrando], ver alguém ainda a criar em todo este caos faz-me, [esperançoso], lembrar quem éramos.
547. [determinado] Há uma mesa digitalizadora velha na arrecadação que ninguém vai, [conspiratório], dar pela falta se acontecer sair com esses, [caloroso], filmes.
Character 1: [sobrecarregado] És a pessoa mais louca ou mais, [grato], humana que resta nesta cidade, e sinceramente já não consigo, [embargado], distinguir.
548. [sábio] Talvez ser um pouco louca seja como nós, [resoluto], continuamos humanas quando tudo o resto se desfaz.
Character 1: Posso sentar-me e ver-te, [hesitante], trabalhar um bocado antes de voltar lá para, [cansado], fora?
549. [acolhedor] Puxa uma cadeira, hum, e eu mostro-te como estamos a ensinar-lhe a, [orgulhoso], dançar outra vez, quer dizer, um frame de cada vez.
550. [frustrado] Meu Deus, não acredito que isto está a acontecer outra vez. Tipo, a sério, quantas vezes é que eu tenho que, hum, explicar a mesma coisa? [suspiro] É que—sinceramente, às vezes sinto que estou a falar para uma parede. E a questão é que, [baixinho], eu sei que não devia deixar que isto me afetasse tanto, mas pronto, cá estamos.

[pausa] Ok, se calhar estou a ser demasiado dura. Quer dizer, eles provavelmente estão a fazer o melhor que conseguem, não é? [hesitante] Ou pelo menos, é, é isso que continuo a dizer a mim mesma. Às vezes penso que se calhar a culpa é mesmo minha—tipo, se calhar não estou a comunicar de forma clara o suficiente? [confuso] Mas depois lembro-me da semana passada quando correu tudo perfeitamente bem, e fico tipo, espera, então o que é que mudou?

[caloroso] Mas sabes que mais? Quando as coisas funcionam, é sinceramente incrível. [entusiasmado] Tipo ontem, ai meu Deus, tivemos aquele momento de revelação em que tudo fez clique! Durante uns 5 minutos, pelo menos. [riso] Depois voltámos direitinhos à estaca zero.

[amargo] Acho que é mesmo assim, não é? Dois passos em frente, [devagar], três passos atrás. E olha—estou cansada. [exausto] Mesmo, mesmo cansada deste ciclo todo. Mas o que é que eu hei de fazer? [voz a desvanecer] Continuar a insistir, suponho...
551. [voz trémula] It passed. Oh meu Deus, passou mesmo—quer dizer, [arfar suavemente] 37 votos. We needed 35 and we got, hum, 37. [riso] I keep checking my phone, continuo a verificar como se talvez tenha lido mal mas, [muito baixinho], é real.

Years of, you know, sleeping in my office, e os divórcios—bem, [arrependido] não é isso que importa agora. What matters is that, eh, 8 milhões de pessoas vão ter [apaixonadamente] cuidados de saúde que podem mesmo pagar! [fungar] Sorry, I just—desculpa, é que continuo a pensar no Marcus. [pausa] That kid who wrote me about his insulin, aquele miúdo cuja mãe estava literalmente a racionar e—[choro] Deus.

[pigarrear] Anyway, so many people said this would never happen, right? Disseram que eu era, tipo, [amargo] "demasiado idealista" ou o que seja. But here's the thing, [confiante] nós conseguimos. Conseguimos mesmo, caralho. [belly laugh] Can I say that on—nem me importo!

[caloroso] My team, they're all—honestly, devem estar todos bêbados a esta hora. [risinho] And my daughter, ela, hum, mandou-me uma mensagem "orgulhosa de ti mãe" com tipo 17 emojis de coração e [chorando ao falar] foi aí que eu perdi mesmo a compostura. Because, I mean, [aliviado] todos aqueles recitais perdidos finalmente significaram alguma coisa, sabes? [pausa longa] We changed everything today. Mudámos tudo hoje.
552. Seis meses. [pausa] Seis meses de merda que ela anda a consumir outra vez e [zangado] ninguém me disse nada? Acabei de encontrar as mensagens no telemóvel do Jake—juro que não andei a bisbilhotar, o telemóvel dele tava [voz trémula] ali aberto e vi o nome do dealer dela. [frustrado] Como é que ele me escondeu isto? Devíamos ser uma equipa, devíamos— [voz a desvanecer]

[perturbado] Fogo, todos aqueles jantares de família em que ela parecia estranha e eu, eu pensei que se calhar tava cansada ou stressada do trabalho. [amargo] Mas não, tava pedrada. [pausa longa] À frente dos miúdos. [sussurrando] Dos meus filhos.

[ansioso] E o Jake sabia, este tempo todo ele sabia e deixou-me ali que nem uma parva a acreditar nas mentiras dela sobre estar limpa. [sarcástico] "Ah, tou tão bem, quase dois anos sóbria!" [furioso] Mas que grande treta.

[triste] Quer dizer, eu percebo que o vício é uma doença, percebo isso, mas as mentiras? [confuso] As histórias elaboradas sobre o padrinho dela e as reuniões onde claramente não andava? [muito baixinho] Como é que sequer seguimos em frente depois disto?

[exausto] Já nem sei se tou mais furiosa com ela ou com o Jake por me fazer ser a única que não sabia. [suspiro] Tipo, o que é que mais me andam a esconder?
553. Três vidas salvas ontem. Três pessoas que voltaram para casa para as suas famílias, e eu só... [amargo] continuo a pensar em como andei a distribuir Narcan como se fossem rebuçados naquela mesma semana em que o Danny estava a morrer sozinho no apartamento dele. [pausa] Toda a gente me chama heroína, sabes? [sarcástico] Pois, a especialista em prevenção de overdoses que nem conseguiu reconhecer os sinais no próprio irmão. Quer dizer, eu literalmente ensino as pessoas sobre o que procurar—o isolamento, as desculpas, a perda de peso. [voz trémula] Ele tinha todos. Todos, sem exceção. E eu só, hum, convenci-me de que ele estava stressado com o trabalho. [pausa longa]

A pior parte é que [chorando ao falar] ainda faço este trabalho. Apareço todos os dias e salvo desconhecidos porque talvez—talvez se eu salvar pessoas suficientes, isso de alguma forma... [voz a desvanecer] Meu Deus, isso nem sequer faz sentido. [fungar] Mas quando reverti a overdose daquele miúdo no mês passado e a irmã dele me abraçou? [muito baixinho] Fingi que ele era o Danny. Só por um segundo. [hesitante] Isso é muito fodido?

Aliás, sabes o que é que me faz continuar? [apaixonadamente] Cada pessoa que eu recupero é o Danny de alguém. O irmão de alguém que tem outra oportunidade que o meu não teve. [muito melancólico] Por isso, sim, vou continuar a fazer isto até não conseguir mais.
554. [arfar suavemente] Oh meu Deus, eu acabei de—eles ligaram mesmo. Tipo, Hollywood. Hollywood a sério. Hum, continuo a olhar para o meu telemóvel a pensar que talvez imaginei tudo, mas não, está mesmo aqui no histórico de chamadas. [muito entusiasmado] Warner Brothers! Eles disseram—espera, deixa-me dizer isto direito—they said my work on that indie film caught their attention, especificamente o, ah, o jornal de época que envelheci e a forma como combinei aquelas canetas de tinta permanente com o ano exato.

[pausa breve]

Quer dizer, sinceramente, achei que estava a ser obsessiva quando passei 3 dias a pesquisar fórmulas de tinta de 1947. A minha colega de casa disse que eu era—como é que ela disse—"patologicamente detalhada." [riso] But apparently that's exactly what they want for this new production.

[ansioso] A questão é esta, tipo, e se eu não conseguir entregar a esse nível? Isto é, sabes, milhões de dólares, atores de primeira linha, tudo mesmo. [voz trémula] Eles querem que eu voe para lá na próxima semana para uma reunião. Na próxima semana! Eu nem sequer—I've never been in a room with producers like that.

[pausa]

Mas pensando bem, [confiante] estive a preparar-me para isto a minha vida toda, não é? Every single prop I've touched, every detail I've obsessed over... [calorosamente] talvez isto esteja mesmo a acontecer porque nunca cortei atalhos. Deus, preciso de ligar à minha mãe. [very happily] Ela vai ficar completamente doida!
555. [caloroso] Sabes, as pessoas fazem sempre aquela cara quando lhes digo o que faço para viver. Tipo, hum, afastam-se um bocadinho, percebes? [risinho] Mas honestamente, aprendi mais sobre—sobre viver mesmo a abrir covas do que alguma vez aprendi sentada naquele cubículo de escritório. [pausa] Olha, o que se passa é que, quando estás lá às seis da manhã, com o nevoeiro ainda agarrado às lápides, e estás a preparar o último lugar de descanso de alguém, começas a reparar em coisas. [devagar] As famílias que vêm, não falam de, é, folhas de cálculo ou promoções. [emocionado] Falam dos almoços de domingo, daquela vez que o pai cantou karaoke terrivelmente mal, [riso] dos biscoitos queimados da mãe que toda a gente fingia adorar. São os pequenos momentos, percebes? [sinceramente] As coisas banais que afinal são, bem, tudo na verdade. [suspiro] Quer dizer, já enterrei CEOs e sem-abrigo, e no fim, o que importa é—riste-te com vontade? [animado] Amaste livremente? Dançaste nos casamentos mesmo com, hum, dois pés esquerdos? [suavemente] Então sim, eu abro covas. Mas o que estou mesmo a fazer é, [pausa] acho que estou a aprender a viver. [muito baixinho] Todos os dias, estou a aprender a estar mesmo viva.
556. [animado] Meu Deus, adoro-vos tanto, pá! Tipo, a sério, quando é que alguma vez nos divertimos mal juntas? Quer dizer, lembram-se daquela noite em que, ah, destruímos completamente a cozinha do Jake a tentar fazer aquela cena do flambé? [rir alto] A cara dele quando o alarme de incêndio disparou! E pronto, noites como esta—dançar até, sabes, tudo doer, cantar aquelas músicas horríveis—é isto que vale a pena na vida, não é?

[pausa]

Devia, é... provavelmente dizer-vos uma coisa mas... [alegre] aliás não, esquece! Quem é que precisa de conversas profundas quando temos, hum, esta playlist incrível? Anda, Sarah, dança comigo! [muito entusiasmado] Esta é a nossa música! Lembras-te quando praticamente gritámos isto no karaoke e aquele pobre barman simplesmente... [voz a desvanecer]

[agridoce] Mas sabem que mais? Só quero que saibam que, bem, estas noites significam tudo para mim. Tipo, mesmo, mesmo. [rapidamente] Mas enfim, chega de coisas melosas—quem quer shots? [gritando] Shots para as minhas pessoas preferidas no mundo inteiro!

[baixinho] Vou ter saudades—quer dizer, ah, vou garantir que fazemos isto todos os fins de semana, está bem? Prometam-me. Aliás, sabem que mais? [apaixonadamente] Vamos só viver este momento agora mesmo. Porque sinceramente, isto—todas vocês—é perfeito. [suspiro] É tão perfeitamente perfeito.
557. [amargo] So apparently I'm supposed to just... smile and welcome them into the family now. Like nothing happened. [pausa] Three years ago, this same person had my daughter crying herself to sleep for, what, six months? [frustrado] And now they're back together and—oh, here's the kicker—engaged. [riso] I mean, honestly, what am I supposed to do with that?

[suspiro] Your kid calls you up, all excited, "Dad, we're getting married!" and it's... them. The one who, um, absolutely destroyed her that summer. [zangado] I wanted to say something—God, I wanted to say so much—but she sounded so... [voz a desvanecer] [caloroso] She sounded happy. Really happy.

[hesitante] So I guess I'm practicing now. For Sunday dinner. "Welcome to the family." [sarcástico] That's good, right? Natural? [pausa] Maybe I should try it with more... enthusiasm. [forced cheerful] "Welcome to the family!" [gemido] 

[baixinho] Look, I know people change. I do. And if they make her happy now, if they've grown up or whatever, then... [reluctant] then I need to let it go. [severo] But I swear, if they hurt her again—[pausa breve] well. [confiante] They'll find out exactly what kind of father-in-law I can be.
558. [arfar] Escolheram-me. Eles realmente—Eu não consigo... [muito baixinho] trinta anos a cortar pedra e escolheram o meu projeto para o memorial. Continuo a ler a carta, tipo, talvez tenha percebido mal? Mas não, está mesmo aqui escrito. As mãos estão-me literalmente a tremer. [pausa breve] Sabes quantas noites passei acordada a desenhar, hum, a refazer cada detalhe? A curva de cada letra, a forma como o mármore vai apanhar a luz da manhã—tudo tinha de ser perfeito. [apaixonadamente] Não são apenas nomes que vamos gravar, são heróis. Pessoas reais que deram tudo. [pausa] O meu avô, também era canteiro, ensinou-me que a pedra recorda-se. [muito sinceramente] Cada golpe de cinzel, cada corte deliberado—fica tudo para sempre. E agora vou ser eu que... [voz a desvanecer] Meu Deus, a responsabilidade disto. Gerações de famílias vão tocar nestes nomes, [emocionado] passar os dedos pelas letras, à procura dos seus entes queridos. Miúdos que ainda nem nasceram vão vir cá em visitas de estudo, aprender sobre sacrifício e coragem. [tom grave] Já gravei lápides antes, claro, mas isto é—isto é diferente. [pigarrear] Isto é história. Vou poder dar a estes heróis algo permanente, [confiante] algo que vai durar mais do que todos nós. As minhas ferramentas, as minhas mãos, a honrá-los da única forma que sei.
559. [hesitante] Olha, eu sei o que estás a pensar—ex-fugitiva a trabalhar com miúdos, não é? Mas sinceramente, é mesmo por isso que consigo chegar a eles. [apaixonado] Estes miúdos, pá, eles não confiam em ninguém de fato que nunca, tipo, passou frio a sério ao ponto de dormir numa merda duma entrada. [pausa breve] Quando lhes digo que passei 3 meses a fugir, a dormir debaixo de pontes, a fugir da polícia—[amargo] a comer do lixo, basicamente—a postura deles muda completamente. [aquecendo] Eles aproximam-se, percebes?

[animado] É como, hum, na semana passada havia um miúdo, não queria falar com ninguém no abrigo. Mas eu reconheci aquele olhar, aquela cena de estar sempre a olhar por cima do ombro, então eu simplesmente—[voz a desvanecer] Quer dizer, contei-lhe daquela vez que tive de roubar sapatos porque os meus se desfizeram literalmente. [riso] E de repente ele está a contar-me tudo. Onde dorme, quem anda atrás dele, porque é que não pode ir para casa.

[com empatia] A questão é que estes miúdos cheiram tretas a quilómetros de distância. Eles sabem quando estás a fingir. [confiante] Mas quando eu digo "eu percebo," eu percebo mesmo, foda-se. [pausa] Eu sei qual é o McDonald's que te deixa usar a casa de banho sem comprares nada. Sei como fazer 20 euros durar uma semana. [muito sinceramente] E sinceramente? [emocionado] Este conhecimento não devia ser desperdiçado quando pode literalmente salvar a vida de alguém.
560. [voz trémula] God, I can't—I mean, we actually got them out. All of them. The whole family. [pausa] My hands are still, like, trembling from working the controls. You know, twenty years I've been operating excavators, but this was—[exhale deeply] this was different. Really different. When I saw that little girl's face through the gap we made, I just... [suspiro] The dad was holding the ceiling beam up with his bare hands—I don't even know how he had the strength, honestly. And, um, the precision needed to not cause another collapse while pulling debris... [ansioso] one wrong move with that bucket and the whole thing could've—anyway, we got them. [aliviado] That's what matters, right? The mom, she was protecting the baby the entire time, just curled around him. [voz embargada] Six hours they were under there. Six. [pausa] I keep thinking about, like, what if I'd moved too fast or, you know, miscalculated the load? But my crew, they were—[grato] everyone was incredible. The way we all just worked together. [emocionado] That family is going home tonight because of what we did. [fungar] I think I need to, uh, just sit here for a minute. Let it sink in. We saved them. We actually saved them.
561. [ansioso] Look, I never thought I'd be using what I learned to, um, help people like this. [pausa] When I studied all that stuff years ago it was just—I mean, it was academic, you know? Like, theoretical. [nervous laugh] But then Saturday happened and I'm watching these kids, er, these peaceful protesters just getting... [voz a desvanecer] 

[zangado] They weren't doing anything wrong! [voz trémula] Just holding signs and, and singing, basically. And then the tear gas started and I just—my body just moved, I guess. [rapidamente] Started shouting about wind direction, telling people to, uh, pour milk on their faces, how to link arms properly. [pausa] Things I never thought I'd actually... [suspiro]

[muito baixinho] The thing is, hmm, once you know how these tactics work, you can't unknow them. [acelerando] You see the formations coming and you're like—okay, they're about to kettle everyone, we need exits here and here. [apaixonado] And these kids, they listened! They actually, um, they trusted me even though I'm just some random person yelling instructions.

[arrependido] I keep thinking about my younger self studying all this stuff, sort of, fascinated by the strategy of it all. [bitter laugh] Never imagining I'd be on this side of it. [caloroso] But honestly? When I saw that grandmother get to safety because we created that, er, that human corridor? [muito sinceramente] That's when I knew this knowledge finally meant something.
562. [confuso] Eight months. Um, I just—hold on, I'm reading this email again because, like, this can't be right. [pausa breve] They're pulling out? [zangado] Because of what? Because Derek—oh my God, he actually, [arfar] he lied about our revenue? 

[furioso] Are you kidding me right now? I mean, we were so close—literally, the contracts were being drawn up and he just, what, [amargo] thought he could fake our numbers? Twenty million, [gritando] gone! Just gone because he couldn't, I don't know, tell the truth? 

[perturbado] The thing is, I trusted him. You know? Like, [voz trémula] I defended him when Sarah said something felt off about those projections. And now, um, [sarcástico] surprise! She was right. [gemido] 

I honestly can't—[pausa] wait, does this mean we're done? Like actually done? Because, er, without this funding, [ansioso] we can't make payroll next month. Thirty-two employees who, [baixinho] who trusted us. Who trusted me. 

[chorando ao falar] I should've checked the numbers myself. But no, I was too busy, like, schmoozing investors and doing presentations while Derek was just, [furioso] what, cooking the books? [suspiro] Eight months of my life. And for what? [amargo] For absolutely nothing.
563. Twenty-three years. That's how long I've been drilling bowling balls, and now Brunswick just—they're gone. [amargo] Like, the whole chain, shuttered overnight. I mean, what am I supposed to do with this certification now? Frame it? [pausa] Nobody's gonna hire a ball driller when there's no alleys left in town. 

[frustrado] It's just, you know, I spent eighteen months getting certified. Learned about, uh, pitch angles and span measurements and lateral—whatever, it doesn't matter now. [suspiro] My dad said I should've gone into plumbing. "Toilets never go out of style," he said. But no, I had to follow my passion, right?

[triste] The thing is, I was actually good at it. Really good. People would drive like forty miles just to have me drill their equipment. And honestly, there was something, I don't know, satisfying about getting someone's grip perfect. [baixinho] Watching their average go up twenty pins because the ball finally fit right.

[zangado] But sure, let's just bulldoze everything for another strip mall. Because that's what this town needs—more nail salons and, er, phone repair shops. [voz a desvanecer] I guess I could... I don't even know what I could do. [muito melancólico] Twenty-three years of expertise, and it's basically worthless now.
564. Eight years. I mean, that's—that's almost a decade of my life, right? [amargo] And they just voted us out like we're some kind of, I don't know, like we're a problem instead of a solution. [pausa] The thing is, um, these people have no idea what happens when you close a clinic like this. Actually, they probably do know, they just—[zangado] they just don't care as long as it's not in their backyard anymore. 

I keep thinking about, er, all my patients. Like Marcus, who's been clean for three years now, and Sarah who just got her kids back, and—[voz embargada] what are they supposed to do? Drive forty miles to the next clinic? [frustrado] Half of them don't even have cars! 

You know what really gets me? [very slowly] We had a ninety-two percent retention rate. Ninety-two! That's basically unheard of in addiction treatment. But sure, let's just, hmm, throw all that away because some people are uncomfortable seeing, [zombeteiro] "those people" in their precious neighborhood. 

[exausto] I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do now. Eight years of fighting for these folks and it's just... [suspiro] gone. Because of a vote. [pausa longa] God, I'm so tired.
565. [arfar] They called me back. The funeral home—they actually called me back! [voz trémula] I thought that door was just... completely closed, you know? After I bombed that interview so badly. [pausa] Mrs. Henderson from the hospice, she um, she apparently told them about my volunteer work. [muito baixinho] About how I sit with families during their last goodbyes. 

[pigarrear] The director said—God, I can't believe he said this—[entusiasmado] he said watching someone hold space for grief without trying to fix it is exactly what they need. [riso] I mean, I wasn't even trying to impress anyone! I was just... [voz a desvanecer] 

[fungar] When I lost Dad, nobody knew what to say to me. So I guess, [caloroso] I learned how to just be there, without the awkward platitudes. [pausa] They want me to start Monday. Monday! [muito entusiasmado] After six months of thinking I'd ruined everything with that disaster of an interview where I—[risinho] where I literally knocked over their urn display.

[chorando ao falar] I keep thinking about telling Dad. He always said helping people through their worst days was sacred work. [tom grave] "Death deserves dignity too, kiddo." [aliviado] Maybe I haven't completely screwed up my life after all.
566. [amargo] Três anos. Três anos que ando, hum, a alertar a administração para estes mesmos problemas. E agora, [riso] ah esta é boa, vão eliminar o meu cargo por causa de "necessidades de reestruturação." Pois, ou seja basicamente não querem alguém que lhes diga, sabes, a verdade. [frustrado] Eu literalmente sentei-me naquela sala de reuniões—quando foi, fevereiro?—e disse-lhes, quer dizer, praticamente implorei-lhes para analisarem a exposição aos derivados. A questão é que, [pausa] eu tinha os modelos, as projeções, tudo. Mas não, eles queriam crescimento agressivo, queriam, é, "maximizar o valor para os acionistas." [sarcástico] Bem, parabéns, maximizaram-se para um buraco de 40 milhões.

[zangado] E o que me deixa mesmo furiosa—vão ficar com o Brad. O Brad! O tipo que, sinceramente, não conseguia fazer uma previsão nem que lhe dessem, tipo, [voz trémula] desculpa, é que—é tão frustrante porque eu sei, [suspira] eu sei que daqui a seis meses vão andar aos papéis. Vão contratar um consultor pelo triplo do que me pagavam para lhes dizer exatamente o que eu tenho andado a dizer. [arrependido] Talvez devesse ter, hum, ficado calada e recebido o meu bónus como toda a gente. Mas isso não é—[pausa] não sei, acho que não é quem eu sou.
567. [hesitante] Estava, hum, a ver fotografias antigas há bocado e... Deus, eu simplesmente—não me reconheci. Não fisicamente, quer dizer, emocionalmente. [pausa breve] Aquela pessoa tinha medo de literalmente tudo, sabes? E o que é que é isto, [voz embargada] eu consegui mesmo passar por aquilo tudo. [fungar] Tipo, ah, todas aquelas noites em que pensava que nunca seria boa o suficiente, que estava basicamente só a... fingir ser alguém que valia a pena conhecer.

[chorando ao falar] Mas já não estou a fingir. Quer dizer, quando é que isso aconteceu sequer? Quando é que deixei de, é, pedir desculpa por existir? [riso] É tão estranho, não é? Eu gosto mesmo de quem sou agora. [calorosamente] Não perfeita, obviamente, mas tipo—genuinamente bem comigo mesma.

A cena é que, [falando sorrindo] fiquei à espera que alguém me dissesse que eu era suficiente, e depois algures pelo caminho eu simplesmente... comecei a acreditar nisso sozinha. [respiração profunda] Todos aqueles anos a pensar que os outros é que tinham a vida resolvida enquanto eu andava só, hmm, aos tropeções no escuro. [confiante] Mas se calhar é assim que toda a gente faz, percebes? Andamos todos aos tropeções até deixarmos de andar.

[muito sinceramente] E honestamente? Tenho mesmo orgulho do caralho da pessoa que está aqui sentada agora. [pausa] Finalmente.
568. [ansioso] Então, hum, acabaram de me chamar ao escritório e—quer dizer, sabes como é que eu tenho andado a contar os dias? [confuso] Tipo, literalmente, tenho dezassete dias marcados no meu calendário antes de, bem, antes da escola de artes começar e eu ia simplesmente—[pausa] E depois o Sr. Henderson senta-me e vem com, [zombeteiro] "Queremos tornar-te efetiva, com todos os benefícios, o pacote todo." [frustrado] Logo AGORA? Tipo, a sério, isto está a acontecer mesmo agora?

[amargo] Três anos, está bem? Três anos a arrumar prateleiras e, ah, praticamente a implorar por mais horas, e eles escolhem ESTE momento para—[suspiro] Sei lá. [triste] O meu portfólio está pronto, já paguei o sinal, disse à minha mãe que finalmente ia fazer isto, sabes? [voz trémula] E a coisa é que a escola de artes não é propriamente—não é barata, e aqui estão eles a oferecer-me seguro de saúde a sério e, [hesitante] ehh, um plano de reforma? Aos vinte e três?

[sussurrando] E se eu estiver a cometer um erro enorme? [acelerando] Tipo, e se isto é o universo a dizer-me para ser prática e eu sou demasiado teimosa para—não, espera, não é—[apaixonadamente] Eu quero isto desde os doze anos! [muito baixinho] Mas a renda é a renda, e, hmm, as tintas custam dinheiro, e... [voz a desvanecer] Já não sei.
569. [arfar suavemente] Não. Não não não, isto não pode ser—espera, deixa-me correr isto outra vez. [ansioso] Pronto então, os marcadores estão a corresponder em todos os locus. Todos. Quer dizer, depois de 15 anos de becos sem saída e, tipo, amostras contaminadas e—[pausa] Jesus Cristo, é mesmo ele. [sussurrando] Os homicídios de Riverside. Apanhámo-lo.

[voz trémula] Eu preciso de, ah, preciso de ligar à Detective Morrison mas ela—não espera, ela reformou-se. Meu Deus, quantas pessoas trabalharam neste caso? [amargo] O Thompson morreu ainda a pensar quem tinha sido, sabes? E aqui estou eu às, quê, 2 da manhã numa terça-feira, só a correr amostras porque não conseguia dormir e—[gasp loudly]

Oh meu Deus, as famílias. [chorando ao falar] Elas estiveram à espera de respostas durante 15 anos. 15 anos sem saber quem—[pausa] Eu devia provavelmente, tipo, verificar isto mais uma vez antes de—mas não, já corri isto 3 vezes. The statistical probability is one in seven trillion. [riso] Sete biliões!

[muito baixinho] Todas aquelas noites tardias, todas aquelas teorias que tivemos que não deram em nada... [aliviado] And it was just sitting there in CODIS the whole time. Ele foi preso o mês passado por, o que era, agressão agravada? [suspiro] 15 anos. [extremamente feliz] Nós conseguimos mesmo. We solved it.
Character 1: I wasn't expecting to see, um, [chocado], anyone from the old life here, especially not you with all this, [trémulo], expensive camera equipment after, well, seven years of complete silence.
570. [timid] The production company didn't mention which clinic we'd be filming at today, and I had no, [ansioso], idea this was your practice. [pausa]
Character 1: [confuso] So you're telling me that, um, after all this time, you just, [amargo], happened to walk into my dermatology clinic by pure coincidence, I mean?
571. [hesitante] Look, um, I know how this must seem, but I'm just here to, [baixinho], do my job calibrating the cameras for the medical documentary, and, well, [voz trémula], I can ask to be reassigned if you want me gone.
Character 1: [defensivo] You always did that, you know, offering to disappear whenever things got, [frustrado], uncomfortable instead of actually talking about what, er, [perturbado], happened between us and why you left.
572. [apologético] I left because, um, watching you succeed in medical school while I was, [arrependido], failing at everything made me feel like I'd never be, well, [muito baixinho], good enough to be your family anymore. [suspiro]
Character 1: [caloroso] That's not, I mean, that's never what I thought, and if I'd known you felt that, [com empatia], way, um, I would have done something different.
573. [aliviado] The truth is I've watched every medical show you've appeared on, followed your, [orgulhoso], research papers from behind a screen all these years.
Character 1: [surpreendido] You've been, [emocionado], keeping track of me while I spent years wondering if you were even, [chorando ao falar], alive, searching social media for any sign of you.
574. [envergonhado] Every time I picked up the phone to call, the, [nervoso], words just wouldn't come out right. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [suavemente] Well, you're here now, and, um, maybe that's what matters, even if it took a, [esperançoso], documentary crew to bring you back, you know?
575. [eager] The filming schedule has us here for three weeks, which means we could, [optimistic], actually talk, maybe grab coffee between takes if you're, [suavemente], willing to try.
Character 1: Coffee sounds like a, [alegre], start, though we both know we'll need more than caffeine to bridge seven years.
576. [sinceramente] I've learned a lot about capturing truth through lenses, but, um, [contemplativo], maybe it's time I learned how to be, [vulnerável], truthful without hiding behind a camera, you know.
Character 1: [embracing] Um, the crew doesn't know we're siblings, do they, because, well, [curioso], I noticed you introduced yourself with Mom's maiden name.
577. I've been using it professionally for years because I didn't want to, [triste], ride on your reputation, but also couldn't, [sussurrando], bear to completely erase our connection, [lacrimoso], even when I was too scared to use it.
Character 1: [terno] You know, um, I became a dermatologist partly because skin tells stories, and well, [melancholic], I kept hoping one day I'd see yours walk through my door.
578. [comovido] And here I am, documenting other people's medical journeys when the most important, [emocionado], story might be finding my way back to you.
Character 1: Um, well, yeah.
579. So maybe we start with coffee tomorrow morning before filming, and, [hopefully], see where that takes us.
Character 1: [cansado] Marcus, I mean, after all these years of, [disappointed], teaching you everything about these old transmitters, um, this is how you, [derrotado], repay that trust?
580. [orgulhoso] Well, you taught me, um, too well about how these, [accomplished], systems work, how to exploit every weakness in the, [amargo], old vacuum tube arrays that you refuse to, [ponderado], upgrade. [chuckles darkly]
Character 1: [old-fashioned] These machines have been broadcasting truth for, [reverent], forty years without fail until you started your, [zangado], campaign of destruction.
581. [defensivo] Truth? Um, you mean propaganda, well, dressed up in your, [sarcástico], quaint notions of journalistic integrity?
Character 1: [exausto] You know, um, I used to see myself in you, that same, [nostálgico], passion for understanding how signals travel through space, well, connecting people across impossible, [broken], distances.
582. [frio] That passion died when I realized these, [contemptuous], connections you worship are just chains keeping people, [fierce], bound to outdated systems that need to, [determinado], burn.
Character 1: [suplicante] Marcus, I mean, whatever cause you think you're serving, um, silencing voices isn't, [desesperado], the answer—it never has been in all of, [grave], history. [sighs heavily]
583. Sometimes the only way to be, [determinado], heard is to create silence first, to make people, [calculista], notice what's missing. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [atónito] So, um, you've been inside our systems for, well, months, watching me try to, [doloroso], fix what you kept breaking, knowing I blamed myself for every, [voz embargada], failure?
584. The guilt you carry for things beyond your, [desdenhoso], control has always been your weakness, old man, that stubborn, [zombeteiro], belief that dedication alone can hold back, [triumphant], progress. [scoffs]
Character 1: [derrotado] Well, I suppose, um, calling security now would be pointless since you've probably, [resignado], disabled those systems too, just like you, [vazio], disabled the trust between us, err, forever.
585. Security will arrive in about, [factual], twelve minutes when the backup generator kicks in. [pausa]
Character 1: Twelve minutes to say goodbye to the, [melancholic], boy I thought I knew, um, the one who used to stay late just to hear the, [melancólico], old transmitters hum their midnight song. [voz embargada]
586. [suavizando] That boy learned that, um, those songs were drowning out the screams of people who, [conflituoso], needed real change, not your, well, comfortable traditions. [exhales slowly]
Character 1: [filosófico] Change built on destruction only breeds more, [sábio], destruction, but you'll learn that lesson the same, [prophetic], hard way every saboteur does.
587. [accomplished] By the time, um, anyone realizes what I've really done here, well, the entire broadcast network will be, [satisfied], compromised beyond repair—my real, [victorious], masterpiece isn't what I destroyed tonight. [smiles coldly]
Character 1: Then I've already failed you in ways that, [sorrowful], can't be undone, just like these beautiful, [lamenting], old machines you've murdered. [pausa longa]
588. Those machines were already, [desdenhoso], dead, just like the world they were built to, [harsh], serve—I simply had the courage to pull the, [final], plug. [footsteps retreating]
Character 1: [baixo] Courage is, [broken], what it takes to build, not to tear down.
589. [distant] Sometimes tearing down is the, [accomplished], only way to clear space for what needs to be, [prophetic], built—you taught me that when you stripped those old, [nostálgico], transmitters down to nothing and rebuilt them from scratch.
Character 1: [nervoso] Please, I need this.
590. [caloroso] I understand this is, um, difficult for you, and I want to help, but well, [reassuring], there are some discrepancies in your employment history that we need to, you know, discuss.
Character 1: [hesitante] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, there were some, [voz trémula], complicated circumstances at my last job that, like, [defensivo], aren't exactly reflected in the paperwork because, you know, [frustrado], my supervisor had it out for me. [suspiro]
591. Um, I see, well... [pausa]
Character 1: I mean, the company was, like, [ansioso], restructuring at the time and, um, they were trying to, [amargo], push out senior employees to avoid paying severance, you know? [pausa longa]
592. [com empatia] That sounds like a challenging situation, and I've seen cases where, [sensible], documentation doesn't tell the whole story, but I still need, [formal], verifiable information to process your appeal. [pigarrear]
Character 1: [rapidamente] Um, I can get you references, well, former coworkers who saw everything, [confiante], and they'll confirm what I'm telling you, I mean.
593. The issue is that, um, your former employer states you were, [cuidadosamente], terminated for cause on March fifteenth, but you claim you, well, [confuso], resigned voluntarily on March third, and we have, like, [severo], conflicting documentation for both dates. [tosse]
Character 1: [desesperadamente] Listen, they backdated everything to make it look like, [zangado], I was fired when really I had already submitted my, [trémulo], resignation letter through the portal system.
594. [suavemente] I want to believe you, and I'm trying to, [sympathetic], understand your situation here, but without concrete evidence like that resignation confirmation email or, [devagar], a timestamped submission receipt, my hands are tied. [soft sigh]
Character 1: [suplicante] Look, um, I know how this sounds, but, well, they deleted my access to the system immediately so I couldn't, [perturbado], retrieve any of those records, and, I mean, [muito baixinho], that was probably intentional on their part. [fungar]
595. Have you considered reaching out to, [pensativo], the labor relations board about potential wrongful termination because that might, [esperançoso], strengthen your case here while also addressing the, [concerned], larger issue with your former employer?
Character 1: [derrotado] Um, I've thought about it, but, like, lawyers cost money I don't have, and well, [envergonhado], without unemployment benefits, I can't even, [sussurrando], afford groceries next week, you know? [gemido]
596. [compassionate] There are free legal aid services that, um, specialize in employment disputes, and I can, well, [helpful], give you their contact information—meanwhile, let me, you know, [determinado], review your file one more time.
Character 1: [esperançoso] So, um, does that mean there's still a chance you might, well, [eager], approve my claim? [arfar suavemente]
597. What I can do is flag your case for, [profissional], secondary review with my supervisor who has more discretion in these situations.
Character 1: [grato] Thank you for actually listening instead of just, [aliviado], dismissing me like everyone else has. [risinho]
598. [kindly] That's what I'm here for—to make sure everyone gets, [sincero], a fair evaluation of their circumstances.
Character 1: [suavemente] I just hope someone finally believes, [triste], what really happened to me. [voz a desvanecer]
599. Well, I mean, regardless of the outcome here, um, please know that, [genuinely], I've documented everything you've told me and, like, [encouraging], your appeal will get the thorough consideration it deserves, you know? [smile in voice]
Character 1: [chocado] Um, well, uh, Sarah.
600. [ponderado] I didn't expect you to show up in person when we could have, [formal], handled this through lawyers.
Character 1: [defensivo] After eight years of working together, I thought you'd at least, [amargo], give me the courtesy of explaining what you think you've, [ansioso], found before destroying my career.
601. [cauteloso] The financial records show transfers that, [hesitante], match the exact timing of those PAC expenditures, and we both know what that, [severo], looks like.
Character 1: [desesperado] Look, um, I mean, those transactions were completely, [frustrado], legitimate consulting fees that had nothing to do with, well, the campaign coordination you're, [voz trémula], alleging here. [pausa]
602. The timestamps tell a, [coldly], different story, especially when cross-referenced with the, [methodical], communication logs we subpoenaed from your, [baixinho], former clients. [suspiro]
Character 1: [trémulo] You know, um, I'm innocent.
603. [com empatia] Well, I mean, I want to believe that, but the evidence is, [preocupado], mounting and my job requires me to follow it wherever it, um, leads.
Character 1: [zangado] So, um, our friendship means nothing when there's a, well, high-profile case to make your reputation on?
604. [hurt] That's not fair and, um, you know it—I recused myself twice but they, [firmemente], kept assigning me back because I'm the only one who, well, understands how these campaigns actually operate. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [suplicante] Sarah, I mean, there has to be something I can, um, explain that would make this go away.
605. [arrependido] The investigation has moved beyond my, [cansado], control at this point. [tosse]
Character 1: [increasingly desperate] Well, um, what if I told you there were other players involved who, [nervoso], orchestrated this whole thing without my knowledge, people who, I mean, used my infrastructure to move their, [sussurrando], money?
606. [anticipating] Names and proof would certainly, [calculista], change the trajectory of this investigation, but you'd need documentation that's, [skeptical], more substantial than just your word against theirs.
Character 1: [determinado] I kept encrypted backups of everything because I, [paranoid], suspected something was off, files that show exactly who was, [amargamente], pulling the strings behind my back.
607. [surpreendido] You're saying you have evidence that could, [esperançoso], exonerate you and implicate others who've been, [eager], untouchable? [arfar suavemente]
Character 1: [exausto] Everything's there.
608. [professionally warm] Well, um, if what you're saying is true, then we need to, [urgentemente], get those files into evidence immediately before anyone realizes you have them, I mean, for your own safety. [pigarrear]
Character 1: [aliviado] So you'll help me then, like, after everything that's happened between us, you're still, [grato], willing to make sure the truth comes out even if it means, um, taking down bigger fish? [riso]
609. I've always been after the, [determinado], truth, not you—that's something you should have, um, remembered from our time working together, you know. [muito sinceramente]
Character 1: [severo] Então os registos da rede mostram que alguém tem andado, [confuso], a aceder ao meu cluster de servidores às três da manhã todas as noites no último mês.
610. [apologético] Ok, olha, antes de, [nervoso], chamares a polícia ou assim, eu posso, [hesitante], explicar tudo e talvez possamos, [rapidamente], chegar a um acordo aqui.
Character 1: [frustrado] Bem, hum, tu és a famosa produtora do 4B que, tipo, [surpreendido], simplesmente invadiu a minha rede doméstica para, quer dizer, [zangado], roubar poder computacional para quê exatamente? [pausa]
611. Renderização de áudio, na verdade.
Character 1: [curioso] Espera, então hum, estás-me a dizer que andaste a usar o meu, [entusiasmado], setup de doze núcleos com aceleração GPU para, tipo, [impressionado], processar faixas de áudio porque o equipamento do teu estúdio não aguentava?
612. [envergonhado] Hum, a tua configuração é, [caloroso], sinceramente a mais bonita que já vi, assim, sabes? [suspiro]
Character 1: [brincalhão] Bonita é uma escolha interessante de palavras para, [divertido], descrever arquitetura de servidores vinda de alguém que acabou de cometer múltiplos crimes.
613. [sedutor] A forma como otimizaste esses containers com, [apaixonado], balanceamento de carga perfeito e aquele script de orquestração personalizado é, [muito baixinho], basicamente poesia em movimento, se formos honestas.
Character 1: [falando sorrindo] Acabaste mesmo de elogiar a minha, [encantado], configuração de Kubernetes enquanto confessas um cibercrime?
614. [confiante] Ouve, hum, e se em vez de, [animado], denunciares isto tudo, pudéssemos, tipo, [entusiasticamente], colaborar em algo que deixaria as nossas duas indústrias de boca aberta, sabes? [riso]
Character 1: [pensativo] Então, hum, estás a propor que, [intrigado], combinemos a tua experiência em áudio com a minha infraestrutura para, bem, [devagar], criar algo que nenhuma de nós conseguiria construir sozinha? [pausa longa]
615. [sincero] Eu podia ensinar-te sobre, [apaixonadamente], modulação de frequência e síntese enquanto tu me mostras, [ansiosamente], protocolos de autenticação adequados em vez do meu embaraçoso password cracking.
Character 1: [alegre] Sabes o que tem piada é como conseguiste, [rindo], contornar a minha segurança mas não conseguiste descobrir como, [zombeteiro], alocar memória adequadamente para os teus render jobs.
616. [defensivo] Esses plugins de áudio são, [frustrado], notoriamente vorazes de memória e a tua documentação era, [amargo], basicamente inexistente por isso tive de, [voz a desvanecer], adivinhar as configurações ideais...
Character 1: [extremamente feliz] Pronto, combinado então.
617. [aliviado] Hum, a sério? [arfar]
Character 1: [entusiasmado] Mas, hum, vamos, [determinado], documentar tudo como deve ser desta vez e, eh, [com empatia], talvez tomar um café primeiro para discutir a arquitetura, sabes?
618. [tímido] Bem, hum, café soa, eh...
Character 1: Amanhã às oito então, e traz, [a brincar], o teu portátil para podermos rever aqueles scripts bash terríveis que andaste a, [risinho], correr no meu sistema.
619. Sabes, devia provavelmente estar, [feliz], mais ofendida com isso mas honestamente, hum, [muito sinceramente], ver-te a trabalhar valeria a humilhação, quer dizer. [tom grave]
Character 1: [hesitante] Hum, desculpe?
620. [exausto] Desculpe, estou a andar o mais rápido que consigo com este carrinho mas as minhas, [voz trémula], pernas não estão a cooperar depois do meu turno.
Character 1: [entusiasmado] Espera, acho que te reconheço—tu és a enfermeira que, [caloroso], trabalhou com a minha mãe no Hospital Memorial há cerca de, [muito baixinho], 6 meses na unidade cardíaca.
621. [confuso] Eu, hum, vejo muitos pacientes e famílias, por isso eu, bem, [apologético], nem sempre me lembro de toda a gente, sabes? [pausa]
Character 1: [apaixonadamente] O nome dela era Margaret Chen, hum, e tu ficaste 3 horas depois do teu turno porque, bem, [chorando ao falar], ela estava assustada e tu seguraste a mão dela durante todo o procedimento de emergência, quer dizer.
622. [devagar] Oh meu Deus, sim, lembro-me da Margaret—ela continuava, hum, a falar-me sobre o filho dela que, bem, [falando sorrindo], trabalhava de noite algures e não podia estar lá, sabes?
Character 1: [aliviado] Hum, essa sou eu. [suspiro]
623. Ela fez-me prometer que te diria, [com empatia], que ela foi corajosa e que não te devias culpar por estares no trabalho. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [grato] Não fazes ideia do quanto isso significou, hum, e tenho vindo trabalhar aqui na esperança de, bem, [trémulo], somehow run into you to say thank you mas quer dizer, [rapidamente], nunca pensei que fosse mesmo acontecer, sabes?
624. [surpreendido] Andaste à minha procura este tempo todo só para, [suavemente], dizer obrigada quando na verdade eu estava apenas, [honestly], a fazer o que qualquer pessoa na minha posição teria feito? [tosse]
Character 1: Não, tu foste além do que qualquer pessoa faria—as outras enfermeiras, bem, [amargo], disseram que o turno delas tinha acabado, mas tu, hum, [orgulhoso], tu ficaste. [arfar suavemente]
625. [pensativo] Às vezes o trabalho não é só sobre medicina, é sobre, hum, [sinceramente], ser humana quando alguém mais precisa, e bem, a tua mãe lembrou-me porque é que eu, [emocionado], me tornei enfermeira, sabes? [fungar]
Character 1: [alegre] Ela está fantástica agora, caminha 3 milhas todos os dias e, [animado], telling everyone about the angel nurse who saved her life. [riso]
626. [humble] É maravilhoso ouvir isso porque honestamente alguns dias, [cansado], I wonder if what I do makes any real difference.
Character 1: [confiante] Olha, hum, eu arrumo prateleiras para viver por isso sei o que é sentir-me invisível, mas bem, [earnestly], o que tu fizeste naquela noite mudou tudo para a nossa família, quer dizer, tu deste-nos mais tempo com ela, sabes?
627. [comovido] Depois de 16 horas a perder 2 pacientes hoje, eu realmente, [shakily], precisava de ouvir isto mais do que tu possas, [lacrimejante], imaginar neste momento. [choro]
Character 1: Por favor deixa-me ajudar-te com as compras—é literalmente, bem, [ansiosamente], o mínimo que posso fazer, e hum, [kindly], a minha mãe nunca me perdoaria se não o fizesse.
628. É incrivelmente querido e estou demasiado cansada para, [agradecido], argue with such kindness right now.
Character 1: [determinado] Ótimo, porque também vou certificar-me de que tens o desconto de funcionária—quer dizer, [brincalhão], não é muito mas os heróis não deviam pagar o preço total pelas compras, sabes? [risinho]
629. [rindo] Sou apenas uma enfermeira cansada que, hum, [humbly], tenta fazer o que é certo pelas pessoas, mas bem, obrigada por me veres como mais do que isso hoje. [respiração profunda]
Character 1: Hum, disseram-me que talvez tenha, [hesitante], documentos sobre a investigação da Dra. Elena Morrison de 1987, e, bem, preciso de os ver porque, [voz trémula], ela era minha mãe e acho que, [baixinho], aconteceu algo ao trabalho dela de que nunca ninguém falou.
630. [formal] Esses ficheiros em particular são restritos e requerem autorizações especiais que, [severo], normalmente demoram meses a obter pelos canais apropriados.
Character 1: Ela morreu quando eu tinha 12 anos e nunca recebeu, [amargo], o reconhecimento pela descoberta que lançou toda a carreira do Professor Hartley.
631. Bem, não devia estar a dizer-lhe isto, mas, [sussurrando], há caixas nos arquivos da cave que nunca foram devidamente catalogadas.
Character 1: [caloroso] Sabes, hum, tenho andado a ensinar as teorias dela aos meus alunos sem sequer, [apaixonadamente], perceber que eram dela porque o Hartley publicou-as como sendo dele, e, é, agora entendo porque é que ela parecia tão, [exausto], derrotada naqueles últimos anos.
632. [com empatia] Sou a guardiã destes registos há 30 anos e, bem, às vezes a verdade fica em caixas enquanto, [arrependido], as mentiras são publicadas nos manuais, percebes?
Character 1: [ansioso] Então, hum, estás a dizer que há provas reais lá em baixo que podem, [entusiasmado], vindicá-la depois de todos estes anos, quer dizer, restaurar a reputação dela?
633. [prudente] Bem, há cadernos de laboratório com datas que, hum, antecedem as publicações do Hartley em 18 meses, juntamente com, [cuidadosamente], correspondência que sugere que ela tentou lutar contra ele mas, [voz a desvanecer], o departamento enterrou tudo...
Character 1: [zangado] A universidade protegeu-o porque ele trazia financiamentos enquanto ela era apenas, [frustrado], uma investigadora júnior sem contactos, e eles, [muito baixinho], destruíram-na.
634. [compadecido] A velha guarda ainda tem influência aqui, e é por isso que, [nervoso], mantive estes documentos escondidos em vez de catalogados como deve ser.
Character 1: [determinado] Precisamos de tirar esses documentos de lá e, [urgentemente], torná-los públicos antes que alguém perceba o que estamos a fazer.
635. [conflituoso] O meu cargo aqui exige discrição, mas às vezes, [pensativo], fazer o que é certo importa mais do que seguir o protocolo, e a história da tua mãe já, [emocionado], assombrou estes arquivos tempo demais.
Character 1: [grato] Quer dizer, estás a arriscar a tua carreira só por, [trémulo], me mostrares estes ficheiros, e, hum, não sei como te agradecer.
636. [determinado] Bem, tornei-me arquivista para preservar a verdade, não para, hum, escondê-la, e se me despedirem por, [orgulhoso], finalmente fazer a coisa certa, que seja.
Character 1: [cauteloso] Hum, como é que sequer começamos a, é, documentar tudo sem alertar os aliados do Hartley que ainda, [amargamente], controlam o departamento de história?
637. [conspiratório] Há um projeto de digitalização na próxima semana que nos daria, [rapidamente], acesso legítimo para mover caixas sem levantar, [sussurrar alto], suspeitas.
Character 1: [esperançoso] A minha mãe dizia sempre que a verdade viria ao de cima eventualmente, embora não acho que ela, [tristemente], acreditasse que fosse acontecer.
638. [suavemente] Bem, às vezes é preciso uma geração para que, hum, a coragem alcance a injustiça, e, [firmemente], nós somos essa geração agora.
Character 1: [emocionado] Passei, hum, 15 anos a perguntar-me se ela era mesmo tão brilhante como eu me lembrava, ou se o luto tinha, [suavemente], amplificado a memória dela, mas agora sei que ela era, [chorando ao falar], tudo o que eu acreditava e mais.
639. Bem, o trabalho da tua mãe vai finalmente ver a luz do dia, e, [sinceramente], isso é tudo o que qualquer arquivista realmente espera.
Character 1: [severo] Acabei de receber uma chamada da Harvard Business School a dizer que não têm, [voz trémula], qualquer registo de alguém com o teu nome que tenha alguma vez terminado o programa deles, o que é, [furioso], particularmente interessante dado o que está em jogo hoje.
640. [confiante] Deve haver algum erro administrativo porque lembro-me perfeitamente de, [suave], atravessar aquele palco em Cambridge há vinte anos.
Character 1: [frio] O escritório de Frankfurt também não consegue verificar nenhum dos negócios que alegaste ter, [frustrado], orquestrado lá. [pausa]
641. [caloroso] Bem, hum, tu sabes como são estes escritórios europeus com a sua, [condescendente], manutenção de registos, e quer dizer, às vezes os negócios mais bem-sucedidos são aqueles que, [zombeteiro], ficam fora dos livros por questões fiscais, se é que, ah, percebes o que estou a dizer. [risinho]
Character 1: [exausto] Esta fusão fecha em quatro horas e tu tens estado a liderar a equipa de integração há, [trémulo], seis meses com credenciais falsificadas enquanto o conselho confiava completamente no meu, [amargo], julgamento. [suspiro]
642. [brincalhão] Hum, as credenciais podem estar, bem, melhoradas, mas os resultados falam por si porque, [persuasivo], todos os marcos foram atingidos perfeitamente e as sinergias que identifiquei vão, [animado], poupar milhões à empresa, por isso, sabes, o pedaço de papel importa mesmo? [riso]
Character 1: Puseste esta empresa toda em perigo com as tuas mentiras e agora supostamente tenho de, [ansioso], explicar isto ao conselho de alguma forma. [gemido]
643. [desdenhoso] Olha, hum, integrei com sucesso, ah, doze empresas usando os meus métodos, e se os aprendi em Harvard ou, [orgulhoso], na rua não devia importar a ninguém que, [baixinho], realmente se preocupe com resultados, percebes?
Character 1: A CMVM vai-se importar quando, [zangado], investigar porque é que deixámos uma fraude gerir uma fusão de mil milhões de euros, quer dizer. [arfar]
644. [sussurrando] Nós duas sabemos.
Character 1: Sabemos o quê exactamente?
645. [hesitante] Bem, hum, que precisavas de alguém que pudesse, [ameaçador], fazer desaparecer certos números problemáticos, sabes?
Character 1: [chocado] Quer dizer, contratei-te para integrar sistemas, não para, [acusador], cometer fraude financeira, e, ah, agora estás a tentar implicar-me em qualquer esquema que tenhas andado a fazer. [tosse]
646. Aquelas contas offshore não se estruturaram sozinhas e a, [sarcástico], contabilidade criativa que tornou este negócio possível exigiu alguém com, [formal], digamos conhecimentos pouco convencionais. [voz a desvanecer]
Character 1: Estás a sugerir que contratei conscientemente uma criminosa para, [enojado], falsificar os nossos livros, o que é, bem, absolutamente absurdo e, hum, completamente improvável. [rir alto]
647. [casual] Hum, o rasto de emails sugere o contrário, especialmente aqueles onde tu, ah, especificamente me pediste para tratar das coisas discretamente, sabes?
Character 1: [desesperado] Esses emails eram sobre manter confidencialidade durante as negociações, não sobre, [gritando], aldrabar os livros ou qualquer fantasia que estejas a tentar inventar aqui. [choro]
648. [falando sorrindo] O conselho pode interpretá-los de forma diferente quando virem como tudo, [calculista], se alinhou perfeitamente com o calendário de aquisição das tuas opções de ações pessoais. [espirro]
Character 1: [derrotado] Mesmo que destruas a minha carreira com estas mentiras, vais na mesma para a prisão por, [muito baixinho], fraude de valores mobiliários assim que as autoridades investigarem as tuas credenciais falsas e, [sussurrar alto], documentos forjados.
649. [demasiado polido] Bem, hum, prisão é uma palavra tão feia, e além disso, acho que ambas sabemos que, [manipulador], a destruição mútua não beneficia nenhuma de nós, por isso talvez devêssemos, ah, discutir como avançar com a fusão como, [alegre], originalmente planeado, percebes? [pausa longa]
Character 1: Ouve, trabalho neste armazém há quinze anos e nunca, [ansioso], vi documentação tão mal feita em provas que supostamente vão condenar alguém amanhã. [pausa]
650. [frustrado] Bem, hum, o que é que me estás, [severo], a dizer exactamente porque, é, tenho as alegações iniciais às nove da manhã e sabes, este caso tem sido à prova de bala há meses.
Character 1: [trémulo] Hum, as amostras de sangue do homicídio Jenkins, bem, foram, [sussurrando], registadas quatro vezes com, [confuso], números de distintivo de agentes diferentes que, quer dizer, não correspondem a nenhum agente real no sistema.
651. [zangado] Então estás a dizer que, hum, alguém andou a, [voz trémula], falsificar os registos da cadeia de custódia das provas principais de que, é, toda a minha acusação depende?
Character 1: [amargo] Olha, hum, não estou a dizer nada excepto que, [rapidamente], estas assinaturas são falsificações, os registos temporais não, [muito baixinho], correspondem às gravações de segurança, e, bem, alguém com autorização elevada andou a, [furioso], cobrir o rasto. [gemido]
652. [chocado] Isto destrói tudo o que construímos, [alto], tudo aquilo que aquela família esperou dezoito meses para ver justiça feita. [suspiro]
Character 1: [apologético] Fiquei até tarde a verificar três vezes porque não conseguia, [hesitante], acreditar no que estava a ver mas quanto mais escavo, [exausto], pior isto fica.
653. [desesperado] Diz-me que há alguma coisa, [chorando ao falar], qualquer coisa que possamos salvar aqui porque se estas provas estão comprometidas então um assassino, [sussurrar alto], sai livre amanhã e sou eu que, [muito triste], falhei com aquelas vítimas.
Character 1: [caloroso] Bem, hum, talvez haja, [aliviado], uma coisa—os frascos de reserva que, é, ninguém registou porque foram directamente para o laboratório independente, sabes.
654. Hum, espera, queres dizer que há, [entusiasmado], provas não comprometidas que não foram, quer dizer, bem, adulteradas algures num laboratório agora mesmo? [arfar]
Character 1: [confiante] É, pois, o Protocolo 47-B exige, [devagar], amostras duplicadas para casos capitais e, hum, bem, quem falsificou estes registos não sabia do conjunto secundário.
655. [sem fôlego] Hum, Deus, se essas amostras estão limpas então, [apaixonadamente], ainda conseguimos apanhar este sacana mas, bem, precisamos de, [freneticamente], as proteger antes que quem fez isto, é, perceba que existem e quer dizer, as faça desaparecer também. [tosse]
Character 1: [monótono] Hum, bem, já está feito. [riso]
656. [demasiado polido] Tu, criatura linda e brilhante—acabaste de, [muito entusiasmado], salvar este caso e provavelmente toda a minha carreira de uma destruição completa.
Character 1: O problema é que ainda temos um problema maior porque alguém, [perturbado], dentro do nosso sistema está corrompido e vão perceber que estamos na pista deles em breve.
657. Pois, e quando perceberem que, [preocupado], contornámos a sabotagem deles, as coisas vão ficar, [sonolento], perigosas para nós as duas mesmo, [voz a desvanecer], mesmo depressa...
Character 1: [arrependido] Já recebi duas, [acelerando], chamadas sem resposta esta noite e o meu supervisor de repente quer transferir-me para o turno da noite a começar, [murmurando], imediatamente o que não pode ser coincidência.
658. [com empatia] Pega no que precisares da tua secretária porque vens, [muito sinceramente], comigo para o gabinete do Ministério Público agora mesmo. [pausa breve]
Character 1: [resignado] Depois de quinze anos a catalogar provas, nunca pensei que me, [rouco], tornaria eu própria prova num caso de corrupção desta dimensão.
659. [determinado] Bem, hum, vamos, [orgulhoso], expor todas as pessoas envolvidas nisto e, é, quer dizer, garantir que nunca mais comprometem outro caso ou, [articulando cada palavra], destroem a esperança de justiça de outra família. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [chocado] Um, I never expected to see you here, quer dizer, como é que tu conseguiste, [trémulo], encontrar-me depois de todos estes anos quando eu fiz questão de, [baixinho], desaparecer completamente da tua vida? [pausa]
660. [amargo] Well, uh, it took me three years of searching, e tive de gastar o meu fundo universitário para contratar um detetive privado para, [zangado], localizar a mulher que me lia histórias antes de dormir.
Character 1: [defensivo] You know, um, you shouldn't have come here, porque, [voz trémula], este não é o tipo de lugar para alguém como tu. [suspiro]
661. [frustrado] So, like, what am I supposed to do, simplesmente fingir que a minha madrinha não me, [confuso], abandonou quando eu tinha 12 anos sem qualquer, [alto], explicação? [gemido]
Character 1: Well, I mean, there are things about my life, que é, [hesitante], melhor tu não saberes, coisas que mudariam a forma como tu, [sussurrando], recordas aqueles bons tempos que tivemos antes de tudo, [voz a desvanecer], desabar...
662. [coldly] Those good times feel like lies now, quando vejo, [enojado], no que te tornaste, quando percebo que tu escolheste, [muito baixinho], isto em vez de fazeres parte da minha vida.
Character 1: [com empatia] You think I chose this life like picking, [arrependido], coisas de um menu, mas às vezes as circunstâncias empurram-te para, [exausto], cantos que nunca imaginaste que te encontrarias presa. [tosse]
663. [sarcástico] Right, because becoming a call girl was obviously, [zombeteiro], a única opção disponível para alguém com mestrado em, [amargamente], serviço social que costumava aconselhar adolescentes problemáticos.
Character 1: Um, your mother's medical bills were eating through, [ansioso], tudo o que tínhamos, e bem, eu não podia deixá-la morrer. [arfar]
664. [atónito] My mother's bills were covered by insurance, e pela, [sussurrar alto], pensão do pai, então isso é apenas mais uma mentira que tu contas a ti própria para, [devagar], justificar escolhas das quais tens demasiada vergonha para assumir.
Character 1: There were other debts, que os teus pais nunca te, [very sadly], contaram.
665. [chorando ao falar] I mean, um, even if that's true, tu podias ter-me, [apaixonadamente], dito alguma coisa em vez de simplesmente desapareceres e deixares-me a pensar se eu tinha, [broken], feito algo errado para te afastar. [fungar]
Character 1: [caloroso] Never that, nunca isso.
666. [desesperado] Well, uh, then help me understand, porque eu passei, [suplicante], 6 anos a tentar perceber porque é que alguém que dizia, [rapidamente], amar-me podia simplesmente apagar-se da minha existência. [laugh bitterly]
Character 1: [apologético] Sometimes protecting someone means becoming, [monótono], a vilã na história deles em vez de os arrastar para a tua, [muito melancólico], escuridão. [deep sigh]
667. [aliviado] You know, um, I actually thought maybe, tu estavas, [curioso], morta porque isso parecia mais fácil de aceitar do que tu, [acelerando], escolheres abandonar-me.
Character 1: Er, maybe I should have let you believe that, quer dizer, teria sido, [formal], mais gentil do que deixar-te ver no que eu tive de me, [murmurando], tornar para sobreviver de formas que tu nunca vais, [pigarrear], compreender...
668. [perturbado] Um, well, the woman who taught me to be brave, e, [severo], honesta aparentemente esqueceu-se dessas lições quando as coisas ficaram, [high-pitched], difíceis e escolheu o caminho da cobardia.
Character 1: You're right, like, I am a coward, uma cobarde que não conseguiu, [envergonhado], enfrentar-te enquanto fazia o que tinha de fazer para, [chorando], manter certas pessoas seguras de coisas que tu não sabes.
669. [resignado] I came here hoping for closure, mas tudo o que encontrei foram, [disappointed], mais perguntas embrulhadas em meias-verdades de alguém que eu já não, [very slowly], reconheço e que continua a insinuar segredos que nunca vai realmente, [vazio], revelar.
Character 1: És tu, não és?
670. [contido] Não sei do que está [hesitante] a falar, minha senhora, só vim cá buscar uns papéis sobre o meu pedido que foi negado.
Character 1: [curioso] Bem, quer dizer, o teu nome corresponde ao, hum, relatório do incidente do derrame químico em março passado onde alguém, [sussurrando], tirou o meu irmão Marcus daquele camião cisterna capotado. [pausa]
671. [baixinho] Olhe, hum, estava só a fazer o meu trabalho, sabes, qualquer pessoa com formação em materiais perigosos teria, [voz trémula], feito o mesmo naquela situação. [suspiro]
Character 1: [grato] Ele está vivo por tua causa.
672. [apologético] Bem, hum, agradeço isso, mas, tipo, agora estou só a tentar, [frustrado], perceber porque é que o meu pedido continua a ser, [amargo], rejeitado quando servi 4 anos no Corpo Químico do Exército e devia, [ansioso], ter direito a estes benefícios, percebes?
Character 1: Estive a rever o teu processo na última hora e há qualquer coisa [confuso] errada aqui—os teus papéis da baixa mostram que foi honrosa mas o sistema continua a [zangado] marcar-te como inelegível devido a um [muito baixinho] erro de codificação de 2018.
673. [exausto] Pois, bem, ando a tentar, hum, resolver isto há 18 meses enquanto, [desesperadamente], trabalho 60 horas por semana a conduzir cargas perigosas para, tipo, [monótono], pagar a faculdade comunitária uma disciplina de cada vez. [tosse]
Character 1: [com empatia] Ouve, hum, eu tenho autoridade para anular decisões em casos como este, e, bem, considerando o que fizeste pelo Marcus, vou, [confiante], pessoalmente garantir que isto fica, [caloroso], resolvido hoje, não no próximo mês, não na próxima semana—hoje, percebes?
674. [aliviado] Isso mudaria [muito sinceramente] tudo para mim—podia finalmente acabar o meu curso de engenharia. [riso]
Character 1: [animado] Então, hum, deixa-me abrir o ecrã de anulação agora mesmo, e, tipo, enquanto faço isso, [entusiasmado], podes contar-me mais sobre o que aconteceu naquela noite porque o Marcus não se, [emocionado], lembra de muito depois da explosão. [fungar]
675. Bem, hum, tudo aconteceu tão depressa, mas lembro-me de ver o camião a tombar e pensar que o meu, [devagar], treino entra em ação automaticamente quando há vidas em jogo, sabes? [arfar suavemente]
Character 1: [determinado] Sabes, hum, vejo centenas de casos todos os meses, mas, tipo, [apaixonado], saber que és tu quem deu à minha família o nosso milagre enquanto o sistema te tem, [furioso], falhado há quase 2 anos, bem, isso acaba agora mesmo.
676. Nunca pensei, hum, conhecer alguém da família dele, e honestamente nem sequer, [embargado], sabia se ele tinha sobrevivido depois da ambulância partir.
Character 1: [lacrimejante] Agora treina miúdos de futebol.
677. [surpreendido] A sério? Bem, hum, isso é, tipo, fantástico de ouvir porque quando o tirei ele não parava de, [sussurrar alto], murmurar sobre os miúdos dele precisarem dele, sabes?
Character 1: Não eram os filhos dele—ele ainda não tem nenhuns—estava a [chorando ao falar] falar da equipa dele, os miúdos que treina todos os sábados e que o [suavemente] adoram completamente. [choro]
678. [comovido] Hum, bem, uau. [pausa longa]
Character 1: A tua aprovação acabou de passar—benefícios completos [triunfantemente] retroativos à data do teu pedido original com juros. [rir alto]
679. [sobrecarregado] Depois de tanto tempo a lutar contra o sistema, foi preciso conhecer-te para finalmente [agradecido] as coisas ficarem certas. [respiração profunda]
