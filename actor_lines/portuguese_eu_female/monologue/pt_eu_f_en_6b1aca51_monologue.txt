=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [gasp] They called me back. The funeral home—they actually called me back! [shaky voice] I thought that door was just... completely closed, you know? After I bombed that interview so badly. [pause] Mrs. Henderson from the hospice, she um, she apparently told them about my volunteer work. [very quietly] About how I sit with families during their last goodbyes. 

[clearing throat] The director said—God, I can't believe he said this—[excited] he said watching someone hold space for grief without trying to fix it is exactly what they need. [laugh] I mean, I wasn't even trying to impress anyone! I was just... [trailing off] 

[sniffle] When I lost Dad, nobody knew what to say to me. So I guess, [warm] I learned how to just be there, without the awkward platitudes. [pause] They want me to start Monday. Monday! [very excited] After six months of thinking I'd ruined everything with that disaster of an interview where I—[chuckle] where I literally knocked over their urn display.

[crying while speaking] I keep thinking about telling Dad. He always said helping people through their worst days was sacred work. [deep pitch] "Death deserves dignity too, kiddo." [relieved] Maybe I haven't completely screwed up my life after all.
