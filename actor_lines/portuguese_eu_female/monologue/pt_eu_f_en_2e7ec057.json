Four years these kids have been apart. Four years. [shaky voice] And Lily, she still asks about her brothers every single week. Every week. [clearing throat] I keep thinking about when I first met them, um... Marcus was so angry, you know? Just this tiny seven-year-old with all this rage because he couldn't protect his little sister. And Jacob, he just... he shut down completely. [very melancholic] Wouldn't even say her name for months. [pause] But today when I told them—oh my God, Marcus actually cried. [crying while speaking] This thirteen-year-old boy who acts so tough all the time just broke down in my arms. And Jacob kept asking if it was real, like, \"Are you sure? Are you really sure?\" [empathetically] These kids have been promised so much that never happened, you know? [sigh] I'm actually kind of terrified it won't work out. Like what if the Hendersons can't handle all three? What if the kids have trouble adjusting? They've been apart so long, they're basically strangers now. [anxious] But then I remember Lily's face when she saw that photo of her brothers last month and... [warm] we have to try, right? [passionately] These kids deserve to be together. They deserve that chance."
