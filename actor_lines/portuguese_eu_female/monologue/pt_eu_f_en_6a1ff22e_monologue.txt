Speaker [en]: Twenty-three years. That's how long I've been drilling bowling balls, and now Brunswick just—they're gone. [bitter] Like, the whole chain, shuttered overnight. I mean, what am I supposed to do with this certification now? Frame it? [pause] Nobody's gonna hire a ball driller when there's no alleys left in town. 

[frustrated] It's just, you know, I spent eighteen months getting certified. Learned about, uh, pitch angles and span measurements and lateral—whatever, it doesn't matter now. [sigh] My dad said I should've gone into plumbing. "Toilets never go out of style," he said. But no, I had to follow my passion, right?

[sad] The thing is, I was actually good at it. Really good. People would drive like forty miles just to have me drill their equipment. And honestly, there was something, I don't know, satisfying about getting someone's grip perfect. [quietly] Watching their average go up twenty pins because the ball finally fit right.

[angry] But sure, let's just bulldoze everything for another strip mall. Because that's what this town needs—more nail salons and, er, phone repair shops. [trailing off] I guess I could... I don't even know what I could do. [very melancholic] Twenty-three years of expertise, and it's basically worthless now.
