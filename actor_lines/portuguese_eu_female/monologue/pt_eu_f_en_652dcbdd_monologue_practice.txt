Speaker [en]: [bitter] So apparently I'm supposed to just... smile and welcome them into the family now. Like nothing happened. [pause] Three years ago, this same person had my daughter crying herself to sleep for, what, six months? [frustrated] And now they're back together and—oh, here's the kicker—engaged. [laugh] I mean, honestly, what am I supposed to do with that?

[sigh] Your kid calls you up, all excited, "Dad, we're getting married!" and it's... them. The one who, um, absolutely destroyed her that summer. [angry] I wanted to say something—God, I wanted to say so much—but she sounded so... [trailing off] [warm] She sounded happy. Really happy.

[hesitantly] So I guess I'm practicing now. For Sunday dinner. "Welcome to the family." [sarcastic] That's good, right? Natural? [pause] Maybe I should try it with more... enthusiasm. [forced cheerful] "Welcome to the family!" [groan] 

[quietly] Look, I know people change. I do. And if they make her happy now, if they've grown up or whatever, then... [reluctant] then I need to let it go. [stern] But I swear, if they hurt her again—[short pause] well. [confidently] They'll find out exactly what kind of father-in-law I can be.
