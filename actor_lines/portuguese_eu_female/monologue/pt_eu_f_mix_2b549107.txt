=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: God, I thought I was done with all this. [anxious] Cinco anos limpa, sabes? Cinco anos de... de trabalho honesto a sério. [short pause] Maria doesn't even know about the passports, os documentos, nada disso. [very quietly] How do I tell her that her engagement ring, como é que lhe digo que o anel de noivado foi comprado com dinheiro de falsificar papéis de imigração? [sigh]

And now Marcus calls me out of nowhere. [frustrated] "Só mais um trabalho, pelos velhos tempos." [bitter] Old times' sake. Como se fôssemos, o quê, amigos de copos? [laugh] We were criminals. Quer dizer, eu era boa naquilo, claro, mas isso não— [trailing off]

[nervous] The baby's due in three months. Três meses e vou ser mãe de alguém. [very sad] What if they find out? E se, hum... e se a Maria descobre e leva o bebé e— [shaky voice] I can't lose them. Não posso perdê-los. Não agora.

[angry] I should've known this would happen. Não se pode simplesmente sair daquela vida. [regretful] All those people I helped get fake identities, e aqui estou eu a tentar construir uma verdadeira. [pause]

Maybe I could, ah... talvez pudesse encontrar-me com ele, só para ouvir o que tem a dizer? [anxious] No, that's stupid, é assim que começa. [quickly] One conversation becomes one favor, um favor torna-se um trabalho torna-se— [very loudly] Trabalhei tanto para isto! [whispering] A Maria está lá em cima. Pensa que estou a ver emails do trabalho.

[sigh] I have to tell Marcus no. [confidently] Tenho uma família agora. Uma vida a sério. [warm] That has to mean something.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: God, I thought I was done with all this. [anxious] Five years clean, you know? Five years of... of actual honest work. [short pause] Maria doesn't even know about the passports, the documents, none of it. [very quietly] How do I tell her that her engagement ring was bought with money from forging immigration papers? [sigh]

And now Marcus calls me out of nowhere. [frustrated] "Just one more job, for old times' sake." [bitter] Old times' sake. Like we were, what, drinking buddies? [laugh] We were criminals. I mean, I was good at it, sure, but that's not— [trailing off]

[nervous] The baby's due in three months. Three months and I'm gonna be someone's father. [very sad] What if they find out? What if, um... what if Maria finds out and she takes the baby and— [shaky voice] I can't lose them. Not now.

[angry] I should've known this would happen. You can't just walk away from that life. [regretful] All those people I helped get fake identities, and here I am trying to build a real one. [pause] 

Maybe I could, uh... maybe I could meet him, just hear him out? [anxious] No, that's stupid, that's how it starts. [quickly] One conversation becomes one favor becomes one job becomes— [very loudly] I worked too hard for this! [whispering] Maria's upstairs. She thinks I'm checking work emails.

[sigh] I have to tell Marcus no. [confidently] I have a family now. A real life. [warm] That has to mean something.
