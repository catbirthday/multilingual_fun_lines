[short pause] Maria doesn't even know about the passports, os documentos, nada disso. [very quietly] How do I tell her that her engagement ring, como é que lhe digo que o anel de noivado foi comprado com dinheiro de falsificar papéis de imigração? [sigh]\n\nAnd now Marcus calls me out of nowhere. [frustrated] \"Só mais um trabalho, pelos velhos tempos.\" [bitter] Old times' sake. Como se fôssemos, o quê, amigos de copos? [laugh] We were criminals. Quer dizer, eu era boa naquilo, claro, mas isso não— [trailing off]\n\n[nervous] The baby's due in three months. Três meses e vou ser mãe de alguém. [very sad] What if they find out? E se, hum... e se a Maria descobre e leva o bebé e— [shaky voice] I can't lose them. Não posso perdê-los. Não agora.\n\n[angry] I should've known this would happen. Não se pode simplesmente sair daquela vida. [regretful] All those people I helped get fake identities, e aqui estou eu a tentar construir uma verdadeira. [pause]\n\nMaybe I could, ah... talvez pudesse encontrar-me com ele, só para ouvir o que tem a dizer? [anxious] No, that's stupid, é assim que começa. [quickly] One conversation becomes one favor, um favor torna-se um trabalho torna-se— [very loudly] Trabalhei tanto para isto! [whispering] A Maria está lá em cima. Pensa que estou a ver emails do trabalho.\n\n[sigh] I have to tell Marcus no. [confidently] Tenho uma família agora. Uma vida a sério. [warm] That has to mean something."
