Speaker [en]: [anxious] Look, I never thought I'd be using what I learned to, um, help people like this. [pause] When I studied all that stuff years ago it was just—I mean, it was academic, you know? Like, theoretical. [nervous laugh] But then Saturday happened and I'm watching these kids, er, these peaceful protesters just getting... [trailing off] 

[angry] They weren't doing anything wrong! [shaky voice] Just holding signs and, and singing, basically. And then the tear gas started and I just—my body just moved, I guess. [quickly] Started shouting about wind direction, telling people to, uh, pour milk on their faces, how to link arms properly. [pause] Things I never thought I'd actually... [sigh]

[very quietly] The thing is, hmm, once you know how these tactics work, you can't unknow them. [speeding up] You see the formations coming and you're like—okay, they're about to kettle everyone, we need exits here and here. [passionate] And these kids, they listened! They actually, um, they trusted me even though I'm just some random person yelling instructions.

[regretful] I keep thinking about my younger self studying all this stuff, sort of, fascinated by the strategy of it all. [bitter laugh] Never imagining I'd be on this side of it. [warm] But honestly? When I saw that grandmother get to safety because we created that, er, that human corridor? [very sincerely] That's when I knew this knowledge finally meant something.
