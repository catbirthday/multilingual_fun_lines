Speaker [en]: Eight years. I mean, that's—that's almost a decade of my life, right? [bitter] And they just voted us out like we're some kind of, I don't know, like we're a problem instead of a solution. [pause] The thing is, um, these people have no idea what happens when you close a clinic like this. Actually, they probably do know, they just—[angry] they just don't care as long as it's not in their backyard anymore. 

I keep thinking about, er, all my patients. Like Marcus, who's been clean for three years now, and Sarah who just got her kids back, and—[voice breaking] what are they supposed to do? Drive forty miles to the next clinic? [frustrated] Half of them don't even have cars! 

You know what really gets me? [very slowly] We had a ninety-two percent retention rate. Ninety-two! That's basically unheard of in addiction treatment. But sure, let's just, hmm, throw all that away because some people are uncomfortable seeing, [mocking] "those people" in their precious neighborhood. 

[exhausted] I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do now. Eight years of fighting for these folks and it's just... [sigh] gone. Because of a vote. [long pause] God, I'm so tired.
