Speaker [en]: [bitter] Three years. Three years I've been, um, flagging these exact issues to the board. And now, [laugh] oh this is rich, they're eliminating my position because of "restructuring needs." Right, so basically they don't want someone who actually, you know, tells them the truth. [frustrated] I literally sat in that boardroom—what was it, February?—and I said, I mean, I practically begged them to look at the derivative exposure. The thing is, [pause] I had the models, the projections, everything. But no, they wanted aggressive growth, they wanted to, uh, "maximize shareholder value." [sarcastic] Well congratulations, you maximized yourself into a forty million dollar hole. 

[angry] And here's what really gets me—they're keeping Brad. Brad! The guy who, honestly, couldn't forecast his way out of a paper bag if you gave him, like, [shaky voice] sorry, I just—it's so frustrating because I know, [sighs] I know in six months they'll be scrambling. They'll hire some consultant for triple what they paid me to tell them exactly what I've been saying. [regretful] Maybe I should've just, er, kept my mouth shut and collected my bonus like everyone else. But that's not—[pause] I don't know, I guess that's not who I am.
