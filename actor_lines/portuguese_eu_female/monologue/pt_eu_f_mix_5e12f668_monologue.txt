=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [shaky voice] It passed. Oh meu Deus, passou mesmo—quer dizer, [gasp softly] 37 votos. We needed 35 and we got, hum, 37. [laugh] I keep checking my phone, continuo a verificar como se talvez tenha lido mal mas, [very quietly], é real.

Years of, you know, sleeping in my office, e os divórcios—bem, [regretful] não é isso que importa agora. What matters is that, eh, 8 milhões de pessoas vão ter [passionately] cuidados de saúde que podem mesmo pagar! [sniffle] Sorry, I just—desculpa, é que continuo a pensar no Marcus. [pause] That kid who wrote me about his insulin, aquele miúdo cuja mãe estava literalmente a racionar e—[cry] Deus.

[clearing throat] Anyway, so many people said this would never happen, right? Disseram que eu era, tipo, [bitter] "demasiado idealista" ou o que seja. But here's the thing, [confidently] nós conseguimos. Conseguimos mesmo, caralho. [belly laugh] Can I say that on—nem me importo!

[warm] My team, they're all—honestly, devem estar todos bêbados a esta hora. [chuckle] And my daughter, ela, hum, mandou-me uma mensagem "orgulhosa de ti mãe" com tipo 17 emojis de coração e [crying while speaking] foi aí que eu perdi mesmo a compostura. Because, I mean, [relieved] todos aqueles recitais perdidos finalmente significaram alguma coisa, sabes? [long pause] We changed everything today. Mudámos tudo hoje.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] It passed. Oh my God, it actually—I mean, [gasp softly] thirty-seven votes. We needed thirty-five and we got, um, thirty-seven. [laugh] I keep checking my phone like maybe I misread it but, [very quietly], it's real. 

Years of, you know, sleeping in my office, and the divorces—well, [regretful] that's not what matters right now. What matters is that, er, eight million people are going to have [passionately] actual healthcare they can afford! [sniffle] Sorry, I just—the thing is, I keep thinking about Marcus. [pause] That kid who wrote me about his insulin, how his mom was literally rationing it and—[cry] God.

[clearing throat] Anyway, so many people said this would never happen, right? They said I was, like, [bitter] "too idealistic" or whatever. But here's the thing, [confidently] we did it. We actually fucking did it. [belly laugh] Can I say that on—I don't even care!

[warm] My team, they're all—honestly, they're probably drunk by now. [chuckle] And my daughter, she, uh, she texted me "proud of you mom" with like seventeen heart emojis and [crying while speaking] that's when I really lost it. Because, I mean, [relieved] all those missed recitals finally meant something, you know? [long pause] We changed everything today.
