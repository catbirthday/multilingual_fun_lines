I mean, we were so close—literally, the contracts were being drawn up and he just, what, [bitter] thought he could fake our numbers? Twenty million, [shouting] gone! Just gone because he couldn't, I don't know, tell the truth? \n\n[upset] The thing is, I trusted him. You know? Like, [shaky voice] I defended him when Sarah said something felt off about those projections. And now, um, [sarcastic] surprise! She was right. [groan] \n\nI honestly can't—[pause] wait, does this mean we're done? Like actually done? Because, er, without this funding, [anxious] we can't make payroll next month. Thirty-two employees who, [quietly] who trusted us. Who trusted me. \n\n[crying while speaking] I should've checked the numbers myself.
