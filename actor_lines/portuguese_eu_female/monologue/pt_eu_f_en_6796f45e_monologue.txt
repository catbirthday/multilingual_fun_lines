Speaker [en]: [confused] Eight months. Um, I just—hold on, I'm reading this email again because, like, this can't be right. [short pause] They're pulling out? [angry] Because of what? Because Derek—oh my God, he actually, [gasp] he lied about our revenue? 

[furious] Are you kidding me right now? I mean, we were so close—literally, the contracts were being drawn up and he just, what, [bitter] thought he could fake our numbers? Twenty million, [shouting] gone! Just gone because he couldn't, I don't know, tell the truth? 

[upset] The thing is, I trusted him. You know? Like, [shaky voice] I defended him when Sarah said something felt off about those projections. And now, um, [sarcastic] surprise! She was right. [groan] 

I honestly can't—[pause] wait, does this mean we're done? Like actually done? Because, er, without this funding, [anxious] we can't make payroll next month. Thirty-two employees who, [quietly] who trusted us. Who trusted me. 

[crying while speaking] I should've checked the numbers myself. But no, I was too busy, like, schmoozing investors and doing presentations while Derek was just, [furious] what, cooking the books? [sigh] Eight months of my life. And for what? [bitter] For absolutely nothing.
