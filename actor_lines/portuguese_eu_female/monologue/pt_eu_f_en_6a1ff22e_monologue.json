And honestly, there was something, I don't know, satisfying about getting someone's grip perfect. [quietly] Watching their average go up twenty pins because the ball finally fit right.\n\n[angry] But sure, let's just bulldoze everything for another strip mall. Because that's what this town needs—more nail salons and, er, phone repair shops. [trailing off] I guess I could... I don't even know what I could do.
