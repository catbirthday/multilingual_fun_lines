Scenario: An agile coach confronts the business development manager who has been promising impossible delivery timelines to clients without consulting the development teams, leading to a crisis that threatens to destroy the company's reputation.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You promised them, um, three weeks for a project that, [voice rising], needs at least four months, and well, now the entire dev team is, [shaking], threatening to quit because you keep, I mean, doing this over and over again.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, umm, the client was about to walk away with, [aggressive], a two million dollar contract, so I had to, well, make the call that would, [cold], keep us in business.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Right, um, because lying to clients and, [disgusted], burning out our teams is definitely, well, the sustainable way to keep us in business, I mean, brilliant strategy there.

Character 2 [en]: [heated] Well, you know, sitting in your agile bubble preaching about, [mocking], sustainable pace doesn't pay the bills when, um, competitors are undercutting us left and right.

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] The competitors are failing to deliver and their, [furious], clients are coming to us specifically because we actually, [trembling], deliver what we promise!

Character 2 [en]: You think I don't know the, [frustrated], pressure I'm under when the board is breathing down my, [cracking], neck about quarterly targets and threatening to, [bitter], restructure the entire sales department? [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [harsh] So, um, your solution is to, well, transfer that pressure onto engineering teams who are, [exhausted], already working sixty-hour weeks trying to, [breaking], meet your impossible deadlines while, I mean, maintaining any semblance of quality?

Character 2 [en]: [loud] Quality doesn't matter if, um, we're out of business because, well, we're too precious about our process!

Character 1 [en]: [incredulous] Quality doesn't matter—did you seriously just, [stunned], say that out loud?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] I'm trying to, um, save this company while you're worried about, [angry], sprint retrospectives and velocity charts that, well, mean nothing to the people paying our salaries.

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Those velocity charts, um, are based on actual data showing what, [deliberate], human beings can accomplish without destroying their, [fierce], health and sanity, but I mean, clearly that's not important to you.

Character 2 [en]: [boiling] Don't you dare lecture me about, [shouting], caring when I've been here until midnight every night trying to, [cracking], keep deals alive.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet fury] Being here until midnight selling, um, lies isn't heroic, it's just, [disgusted], creating more problems that, well, someone else has to solve. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: You know what, I mean, maybe if you spent less time, [accusatory], coddling developers and more time understanding, [harsh], market realities, we wouldn't be having this, um, conversation right now.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Market realities, um, include the fact that when we fail to deliver, [stern], which we will, our reputation gets destroyed and, well, no amount of sales tactics can fix that.

Character 2 [en]: The only reputation that matters is whether we're, [bitter], still here next quarter.

Character 1 [en]: Three senior engineers handed in their, [heavy], resignations this morning because of promises you made, [defeated], last week without even checking if we had the, [exhausted], capacity to deliver on them.

Character 2 [en]: [panicking] Wait, um, three resignations—who, I mean, which teams are, [frantic], affected because we have deliverables due, [desperate], next week that absolutely cannot slip, well, not even by a day.

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] The payment processing team, um, the API team lead, and, [resigned], your star mobile developer who, well, specifically cited your promises as why she's leaving.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] This can't be happening right, [breaking], now when everything is finally coming, [quiet], together with these deals. [long pause]
