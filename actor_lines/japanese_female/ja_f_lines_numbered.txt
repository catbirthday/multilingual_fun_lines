# Speaker Lines Only (Translated) - Japanese (Female)
============================================================

1. [measured] Well, I mean, the law is quite clear about, [firm], vertical integration limits, and your company has, um, systematically exceeded them by, [disturbed], controlling both the platform and, er, the partnerships that depend on it. [sighs]
2. Those partners signed contracts knowing, [sympathetic], the regulatory risks, and many of them testified about the, [uncomfortable], predatory terms you imposed on them during the hearings.
3. [stern] Um, well, theoretical?
4. [cold] I have depositions from forty-seven partners describing how you, [precise], forced them to accept increasingly restrictive terms or face immediate delisting.
5. [sharp] Profitably operating because they have, um, no alternative after you systematically, [disgusted], acquired or destroyed every competing platform, well, over the past decade. [pause]
6. [exhausted] Listen, um, I've reviewed twelve thousand pages of internal emails where your executives, [grim], explicitly discuss crushing competitors, you know?
7. The emails show your team celebrating when smaller platforms, [disturbed], went bankrupt after you undercut their partnership fees to unsustainable levels.
8. [thoughtful] Which is exactly why your company structured things this way—to make yourselves, [bitter], too essential to regulate while extracting monopoly rents from partners who have, [sad], nowhere else to go.
9. [gentle] The remedy phase begins next month and your legal team can present, [professional], alternative proposals then, but the finding of liability stands.
10. [quiet] The law decided.
11. [defensive] Look, umm, the client was about to walk away with, [aggressive], a two million dollar contract, so I had to, well, make the call that would, [cold], keep us in business.
12. [heated] Well, you know, sitting in your agile bubble preaching about, [mocking], sustainable pace doesn't pay the bills when, um, competitors are undercutting us left and right.
13. You think I don't know the, [frustrated], pressure I'm under when the board is breathing down my, [cracking], neck about quarterly targets and threatening to, [bitter], restructure the entire sales department? [laughs bitterly]
14. [loud] Quality doesn't matter if, um, we're out of business because, well, we're too precious about our process!
15. [desperate] I'm trying to, um, save this company while you're worried about, [angry], sprint retrospectives and velocity charts that, well, mean nothing to the people paying our salaries.
16. [boiling] Don't you dare lecture me about, [shouting], caring when I've been here until midnight every night trying to, [cracking], keep deals alive.
17. You know what, I mean, maybe if you spent less time, [accusatory], coddling developers and more time understanding, [harsh], market realities, we wouldn't be having this, um, conversation right now.
18. The only reputation that matters is whether we're, [bitter], still here next quarter.
19. [panicking] Wait, um, three resignations—who, I mean, which teams are, [frantic], affected because we have deliverables due, [desperate], next week that absolutely cannot slip, well, not even by a day.
20. [defeated] This can't be happening right, [breaking], now when everything is finally coming, [quiet], together with these deals. [long pause]
21. [warm] The weight you're carrying shows in your shoulders, [tactful], like someone who's been holding up the world alone too long.
22. [hesitantly] More than you'd imagine, though most aren't, [slowly], developers who just lost eight million dollars in locked funds to, [whispering], an elegant zero-day attack.
23. [very quietly] Well, you know, before this life I had, um, different skills that paid less but, er, challenged me more intellectually.
24. The person who hired me to write that exploit, um, they're one of your, [regretful], closest advisors and they paid enough to, well, [releasing], set me free from this work forever, you know, [bitter], if I choose to walk away. [pause]
25. [empathetically] The short position they took before the hack netted them, [careful], thirty million in profit. [laugh]
26. Already done. [chuckle]
27. [confidently] I embedded their wallet signatures in the exploit code itself, umm, where any decent forensic audit will, you know, find them eventually. [groan]
28. [sad] Well, I left you something else too—um, a backdoor that only responds to your private key that, like, [hopeful], lets you recover the funds if you know where to look. [cry]
29. [flirtatious] Check line 1,337 of the contract because, um, that's where I hid your, [playful], redemption knowing that, you know, [sincere], only you would understand the reference to your first hello world program. [sneeze]
30. [melancholic] Well, by morning I'll be just another ghost in the blockchain, um, but tonight I wanted to, like, [honest], see the person whose code I admired before I, you know, [final], had to tear it all apart. [yawn]
31. [stern] Well, um, you need to move very slowly because, [whispering], those aren't just any wolves, you know. [pause]
32. [empathetically] Listen, er, I have food and medical supplies but we need to, [carefully], back away from this denning site first, I mean, without triggering their defensive instincts.
33. Those animals, as you call them, are, [passionately], the last breeding pair of timber wolves in this region and, well, if we disturb them now during denning season, um, five years of conservation work gets, [bitter], completely destroyed. [sigh]
34. [warm] I'm going to help you but we need to move, [very slowly], exactly how I tell you.
35. Sarah, I mean, my radio equipment is, [quickly], two miles north at the research station, um, where we can call for evacuation, you know.
36. [defensive] Um, well, eight months actually. [laugh]
37. [excited] These wolves were thought extinct until I tracked them here and documented their denning behaviors which will, [animatedly], revolutionize our understanding of post-trauma species recovery after the, [proudly], fires that devastated this ecosystem three years ago. [chuckle]
38. Your brother was, well, um, one of the Granite Mountain crew that, [very quietly], saved the wolf sanctuary, er, during the evacuation. [long pause]
39. [apologetic] I didn't know, I mean, about your brother but those wolves he saved, well, they're the parents of, [gently], these ones here and maybe that means, um, something about cycles and, [hopeful], survival that we don't fully understand yet. [sniffle]
40. [very sincerely] Um, I know his name, er. [short pause]
