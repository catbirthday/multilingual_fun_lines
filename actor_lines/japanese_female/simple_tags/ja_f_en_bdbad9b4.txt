Scenario: A plane crash survivor encounters a wildlife biologist studying wolves in the remote wilderness where they've been stranded for three days.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The plane went down three days ago and I've been, [shaky voice], following the river hoping to find someone but instead I found, [confused], you sitting here watching those wolves.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Well, um, you need to move very slowly because, [whispering], those aren't just any wolves, you know. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] I haven't eaten anything except some berries that made me, [very quietly], sick yesterday and my ankle is, [hesitantly], swelling from the crash and I don't know if I can, [slowly], keep walking much longer.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Listen, er, I have food and medical supplies but we need to, [carefully], back away from this denning site first, I mean, without triggering their defensive instincts.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] You're more concerned about those animals than the fact that I've been, [trembling], lost in these mountains for seventy-two hours watching the search planes, [loudly], fly right past me.

Character 2 [en]: Those animals, as you call them, are, [passionately], the last breeding pair of timber wolves in this region and, well, if we disturb them now during denning season, um, five years of conservation work gets, [bitter], completely destroyed. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: Please just help me.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I'm going to help you but we need to move, [very slowly], exactly how I tell you.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] My name is Sarah and I was flying to, [crying while speaking], my daughter's wedding when the engine failed and now she probably thinks I'm, [whispering loudly], dead. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Sarah, I mean, my radio equipment is, [quickly], two miles north at the research station, um, where we can call for evacuation, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] You've been living out here alone studying these wolves for how long because you seem, [monotone], completely unfazed by finding a plane crash survivor and that's, [suspicious], not exactly a normal reaction to this situation.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Um, well, eight months actually. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Eight months alone in the wilderness just watching wolves and taking, [enunciating every word], notes about their behavior. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [excited] These wolves were thought extinct until I tracked them here and documented their denning behaviors which will, [animatedly], revolutionize our understanding of post-trauma species recovery after the, [proudly], fires that devastated this ecosystem three years ago. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: The fires that killed my brother when his, [regretful], firefighting crew got trapped in the canyon below us which is why I, [very melancholic], hate flying over these mountains but had no, [trailing off], other choice to get to the wedding... [cry]

Character 2 [en]: Your brother was, well, um, one of the Granite Mountain crew that, [very quietly], saved the wolf sanctuary, er, during the evacuation. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: He saved wolves while nineteen men died including, um, himself and now here I am, [angry], three years later being told to be careful not to, er, disturb the very creatures he, [bitterly], chose over his own life. [gasp loudly]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I didn't know, I mean, about your brother but those wolves he saved, well, they're the parents of, [gently], these ones here and maybe that means, um, something about cycles and, [hopeful], survival that we don't fully understand yet. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [tearfully] Take me to your radio station so I can call my daughter and tell her I'm, [shaking], alive even though her uncle died saving animals that don't even, [whispering], know his name. [cry loudly]

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Um, I know his name, er. [short pause]
