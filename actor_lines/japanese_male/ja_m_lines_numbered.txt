============================================================

1. [monotone] The funeral home down the street recommended your shop, said you do, [clearing throat], quality work on short notice.
2. [apologetic] Look, I know this is awkward but I need this done by Thursday and, [trailing off], there's nobody else who can... [long pause]
3. [very meekly] It's, uh, for your grandmother, she passed last week and, um, [regretful] I thought maybe you should know, even if, well, [slowly] even if you hate me for everything else.
4. [frustrated] She didn't want me to, okay? Said, uh, [very quietly] she'd reach out herself if she wanted to, but, well, [anxious] she never did and I respected that. [groan]
5. [stern] That's not fair and you know it, there were, [pause] things happening you were too young to understand, [quickly] circumstances that made staying impossible.
6. [whispering] Your mother had a restraining order against me after the drinking got bad, [trembling], and I wasn't going to make things worse. [sniffle]
7. [relieved] I've been sober eight years now, got help eventually, [very sincerely] but by then I figured the damage was done and you were better off, [speeding up] without me stirring everything up again.
8. [warm] None of it was ever your fault, you were perfect, just, [stuttering], p-perfect the way you were.
9. [very melancholic] I understand.
10. [formal] That's fine, I'll pay whatever it costs to do right by her, [short pause], at least this once.
