=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] I, um, didn't expect to see you here after, well, [pause] fifteen years of nothing, and now you just, uh, [hesitantly] walk in wanting a memorial plaque?

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] The funeral home down the street recommended your shop, said you do, [clearing throat], quality work on short notice.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, you're just going to pretend like, [bitter] we're strangers and I'm, well, just another vendor for whatever this is? [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, I know this is awkward but I need this done by Thursday and, [trailing off], there's nobody else who can... [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [angry] You disappear from my life when I was twelve, [shaky voice] miss every graduation, every birthday, [loudly] every moment that mattered, and now you want me to make a sign for someone who actually stayed?

Character 2 [en]: [very meekly] It's, uh, for your grandmother, she passed last week and, um, [regretful] I thought maybe you should know, even if, well, [slowly] even if you hate me for everything else.

Character 1 [en]: Grandma's gone? You couldn't even, um, [gasp softly] call me when she was sick, I mean, just let me say goodbye? [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] She didn't want me to, okay? Said, uh, [very quietly] she'd reach out herself if she wanted to, but, well, [anxious] she never did and I respected that. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You respected her wishes but never mine when I begged you to stay, [sarcastic] how noble of you.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] That's not fair and you know it, there were, [pause] things happening you were too young to understand, [quickly] circumstances that made staying impossible.

Character 1 [en]: Um, circumstances? That's what you're calling it now? Well, [mockingly] abandoning your family, uh, [bored] running off to God knows where, hmm, [very loudly] those are choices, not circumstances! [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Your mother had a restraining order against me after the drinking got bad, [trembling], and I wasn't going to make things worse. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] So you just, um, gave up? Didn't even, well, [empathetically] try to get help or fight for visitation when you got better, uh, [passionately] if you ever got better? [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] I've been sober eight years now, got help eventually, [very sincerely] but by then I figured the damage was done and you were better off, [speeding up] without me stirring everything up again.

Character 1 [en]: Better off? I spent years, [upset] wondering what I did wrong to make you leave, [crying while speaking] thinking maybe if I'd been a better kid you would have stayed.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] None of it was ever your fault, you were perfect, just, [stuttering], p-perfect the way you were.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I'll make the plaque for grandma because she deserved better than both of us, [whispering loudly] but after Thursday, [sadly] we go back to being strangers.

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] I understand.

Character 1 [en]: The design consult fee is two hundred, materials and labor will be another, [coldly], eight hundred for a rush job. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [formal] That's fine, I'll pay whatever it costs to do right by her, [short pause], at least this once.
