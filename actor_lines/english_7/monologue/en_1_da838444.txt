=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp] Oh my god. Oh my god, they said yes. They actually—they actually said yes! [very excited] Three point five million dollars. Three point five MILLION dollars! [laugh] I can't even—my hands are literally shaking right now. All those nights, all those pitch decks, the endless revisions where I thought I was losing my mind over font choices and market sizing and— [pause] Wait, did that really just happen? Did I just walk out of that room with, um, with everything we asked for? [disbelieving] They didn't even negotiate down. They just... they believed in it. In us. In me. [quietly] Holy shit. [laugh loudly] I mean, when he said "we're in," I think I blacked out for a second. My whole body just went—whoosh—like all the air left. [speeding up] And now we can actually hire the team, get the office space, build the platform the way it's supposed to be built, not just these hacky prototypes we've been— [gasp softly] Oh god, I need to call Mom. And Sarah. And the team! Everyone who said I was crazy for leaving my job, for betting everything on this idea that seemed so, uh... so impossible six months ago. [extremely happy] We did it. We actually fucking did it!
