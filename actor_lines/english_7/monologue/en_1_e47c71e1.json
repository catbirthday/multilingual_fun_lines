[extremely happy] Twenty-third of December and we're DONE! [long pause] This is... I mean, this has never happened in what, fifteen years? [whispering] I don't even know what to do with myself. [laugh loudly] \n\nLook, I was prepared to be here until, you know, probably midnight on Christmas Eve like every other year. [exhausted] My back is killing me, sure, but we actually did it. [relieved] No more angry customers calling about delayed packages, no more overtime until 2 AM, no more— [gasp] oh my God, I can actually go to my daughter's recital tomorrow! [happy] She's gonna flip when I tell her.\n\n[quickly] Remember last year when Marco literally slept in the break room for three nights straight? [chuckle] And now look at us—home before dinner for once. [warm] Honestly, this team is just... we really pulled it off, didn't we? [very sincerely] I'm so proud of everyone. \n\n[shouting] Someone needs to take a picture of that empty warehouse floor! [delighted] History right there, people!"
