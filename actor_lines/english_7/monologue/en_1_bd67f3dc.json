[hesitantly] I almost threw this whole thing away, you know? [bitter] Three weeks ago I was literally dragging files to the trash, thinking who was I kidding. [sigh] Like, I'd convinced myself it was garbage. [mumbling] Total amateur hour stuff. [pause] And now they're talking about... um... international exhibitions? [very excited] The curator used the word \"groundbreaking\"! [laugh loudly] Me! [shaky voice] I keep reading the email over and over because, I don't know, maybe I'm misunderstanding something? [quickly] But no, it's real, they're offering twice what I even dreamed of asking. [crying while speaking] All those nights I stayed up reworking it, thinking I was just, you know, wasting my time. [relieved] My mom kept saying don't give up, and I'd just roll my eyes like, sure mom, whatever. [extremely happy] But she was right! [pause] God, I need to call her. [warm] She's gonna lose her mind. [laugh hard] I can't believe I almost let fear win. [very sincerely] This is really happening."
