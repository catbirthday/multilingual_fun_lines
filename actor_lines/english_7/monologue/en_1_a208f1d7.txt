=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Wait, what do you mean she's been... hold on. [pause] Mom just told me that Katie's been—for years? [upset] She's been going to you guys behind my back for years? [laugh bitterly] Oh my God. I mean, I thought we were close, you know? [hurt] All those times she'd ask me how things were going, acting all concerned and... ugh, she was just gathering intel. [angry] That's what this was. [pause] And you're telling me this started when she was, what, fourteen? [very sad] So every single time I confided in her about, um... about anything real, she'd just run straight to you and Dad? [frustrated] God, I'm so stupid. [sigh] I literally defended her last week when Sarah said she seemed two-faced. [bitter] "No, not Katie, she's different." [pause] Yeah, right. [quietly] The thing is, I would've... if she had problems with me, she could've just talked to me. [upset] But instead she made me look like some kind of, I don't know, problem child who needed monitoring? [angry] And what did she even tell you? [pause] Actually, no—I don't want to know. [very sad] I just... hmm, I thought she was the one person who actually got me. [trailing off] Guess that was just another lie she let me believe...
