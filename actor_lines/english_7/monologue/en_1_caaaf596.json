[happy] You know how many times he sat in my office, just sobbing about those kids? [emotional voice trailing off] And now they're... they're back home with him. [sniffle] God, I remember when he first walked in here. [quietly] Shaking so bad he couldn't even hold the clipboard. [pause] His daughter's drawings in his wallet, all crumpled up from him looking at them constantly. [warm] And now she's drawing new ones on his actual fridge. [laugh] I saw the photos on his phone today—they went to the beach last weekend. [very sincerely] His son's learning guitar now, did you know that? Marcus bought him one with his first real paycheck from the warehouse job. [chuckle] He was so proud of that receipt, kept showing everyone. [pause] You know what the hardest part is? [slowly] Watching them struggle for so long, wondering if they'll make it. [relieved] But Marcus did. He actually, um... he actually did it. [extremely happy] Two years clean and his babies are home. [sigh] This is why we do this job."
