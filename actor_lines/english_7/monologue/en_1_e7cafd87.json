[laugh] I keep staring at this plaque like it's going to disappear or something. [warm] You know, when I first started implementing those new temperature protocols, everyone thought I was being ridiculous. [frustrated] \"Why do we need to check every thirty minutes? The old way worked fine!\" [sigh] But it didn't work fine, that was the whole point. [passionately] We were one contamination incident away from shutting down! [short pause] I remember staying late, um, rewriting all those procedures by myself because nobody else believed it mattered. [very sad] There were nights I'd just sit in that cold processing room wondering if I was wasting my time. [relieved] But look at us now—zero incidents in eighteen months! [excited] The inspectors actually complimented our documentation system! [laugh loudly] They never compliment anything! [proud] Every single person on that floor follows protocol now, and it's... it's like watching a completely different operation. [emotional] When they called our plant name at the ceremony, I almost couldn't stand up. [chuckle] My legs were shaking so bad. [very sincerely] This award isn't just mine—it belongs to everyone who stuck with the new standards even when it was hard. [confidently] And this is just the beginning."
