[pause] My kids can actually, you know, they can do soccer now, dance classes, whatever they want. [bitter] And all I have to do is pretend I don't see those pellets washing into the creek behind the facility. \n\nI mean, I know what we make. Those little nurdles that end up in... everywhere. Fish, birds, probably in us too at this point. [shaky voice] But what am I supposed to do? Turn it down? Tell my wife, sorry honey, my conscience is worth more than our mortgage? [sarcastic] Yeah, that'll go over great.\n\nThe thing is, um... I used to care about this stuff. Really care. [sad] Had the reusable everything, wrote letters to Congress, the whole deal. And now I'm literally—God, I'm literally part of the problem. [long pause] But they need me to start Monday, and I already said yes, so... [trailing off]\n\n[mumbling] Twenty-eight dollars an hour though. [sigh] I guess everyone has their price, right? Mine's apparently twenty-eight dollars an hour and dental coverage."
