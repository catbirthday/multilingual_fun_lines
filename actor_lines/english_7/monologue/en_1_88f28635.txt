=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: She called this morning with the news—five years cancer-free. [warm] Five whole years, can you believe that? I was making breakfast and I just... I started crying right there at the stove. [sniffle] Happy tears, obviously, but also... God, I don't know. Tom lost his job three weeks ago and we're, um, we're behind on the mortgage now. [anxious] And here's Sarah talking about the celebration dinner they're planning at that fancy place downtown, the one with the, what's it called... the tasting menu thing? [bitter] Seventy dollars a person, she said, like it was nothing. 

I mean, I'm happy for her. [quickly] I really am, it's just—we had to sell my mom's ring last week. The one she left me. [shaky voice] And I'm sitting there on the phone saying "that's wonderful" while I'm literally looking at the foreclosure notice on our kitchen table. 

She asked if we're coming to the dinner. [exhausted] What am I supposed to say? "Sorry, we can't afford gas to drive there"? So I just... I said yes. [quietly] Tom doesn't even know yet. He's gonna—actually, I don't even know what he's gonna say. [sigh] 

Maybe we can figure something out. Borrow from my dad or... I don't know. [trailing off] She deserves this celebration. She really does.
