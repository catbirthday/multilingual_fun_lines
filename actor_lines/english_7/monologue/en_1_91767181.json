[anxious] The call came in around midnight—family of four, their rental SUV died somewhere near Miller's Pass, and the storm was, I mean... [trailing off] [frustrated] The visibility was maybe ten feet, winds were insane. [quickly] So I'm thinking, okay, if their engine's dead in those temps, they've got maybe an hour before... [pause] [determined] Anyway, I loaded up everything—spark plugs, belts, battery jumper, the works. [shaky voice] When I finally found them, the kids were crying, the parents were just... frozen with fear. [relieved] Thank God it was just a seized fuel line—something I could actually fix. [animated] The gel in their diesel, you know? Classic rookie mistake for tourists. [warm] Fifteen minutes with my heat gun and some additives, and that engine turned over like nothing happened. [chuckle] The mom, she literally hugged me. [very quietly] Said I saved their lives. [hesitantly] I don't know about that, but... [pause] [happy] I guess that's why I do this job, right? [empathetically] You never know when someone's counting on you out there."
