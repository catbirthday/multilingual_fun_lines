Subject: Your brass instrument repair work just restored a Civil War-era bugle for a veteran's memorial service

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very quietly] When I first opened that case and saw the bugle... mmm, I don't know how to explain it. You could feel the history in it, you know? [pause] A hundred and sixty years old, and it's going to play again tomorrow. [emotional] For the memorial service.

The dents were, um... they were probably from actual battles. [shaky voice] I kept thinking about that while I was working on it. Like, some soldier carried this through—I don't know, Gettysburg maybe? Antietam? And now it's in my shop, and I'm... [trailing off] 

[anxious] God, what if I messed something up? This isn't just some high school trumpet, this is... [pause] No, no it's good. I tested it three times. [relieved] The valves work perfectly now, the—well, it doesn't have valves, but the mouthpiece fits right, and the sound... [warm] Oh man, when I played that first note after the restoration, it was like... like waking something up that's been sleeping.

[very sincerely] Tomorrow, when they play Taps on this bugle, it's gonna be with the same instrument that, um, that called soldiers home during the Civil War. [emotional] And I fixed it. Me. My hands brought it back. [pause] That's... yeah. That's something.
