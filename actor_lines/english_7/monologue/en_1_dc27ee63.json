[frustrated] I wasn't even here! [pause] I was at my sister's wedding, for crying out loud. There's literally photos of me in a tux, doing the chicken dance three hours away. [bitter] But sure, somehow I telepathically made it rain and, what, forgot to check the drainage system from the reception hall? [sarcastic] That makes perfect sense, Henderson. \n\n[furious] You know what the worst part is? He knows I wasn't here. [slowly] He approved my time off request two months ago. [shouting] Two months! [exhale] [quietly] But when district management shows up asking questions, suddenly it's, um... suddenly it's my fault because I'm the one who usually checks the pumps. [mocking] \"Well, if Marcus had been here, this wouldn't have happened.\" [upset] Like I'm supposed to control the weather schedule around my personal life. \n\n[exhausted] Twenty-three graves compromised. Twenty-three families we have to call. [sad] And somehow I'm taking the fall for this because Henderson can't admit he didn't assign anyone to cover my shift. [sigh] Six years I've worked here without a single incident. [very quietly] Six years. [bitter] And this is what I get."
