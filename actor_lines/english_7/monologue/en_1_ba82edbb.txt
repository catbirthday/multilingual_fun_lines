Subject: Getting the promotion you always wanted just as you realize you don't actually want to work here anymore

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: They offered it to me. The regional director position. [pause] Sarah just pulled me into her office and said congratulations, you got it. Ten years. Ten years I've been working toward this exact moment. [laugh] And I'm standing there, nodding and smiling, and all I can think about is how much I hate that conference room. The one with the broken blinds that nobody ever fixes. [slowly] That's my conference room now, I guess. [bitter] And I'll be the one running those Monday meetings where everyone pretends to care about quarterly projections while secretly shopping online. God, when did I start noticing all this? When did I— [trailing off] I used to love this place. [sad] I used to actually believe in what we were doing here. But somewhere between the third restructuring and, um, and watching them lay off half my team while giving the executives bonuses, something just... broke. [sigh] And now they're handing me everything I thought I wanted. [very quietly] The timing is almost funny, isn't it? Like the universe is playing some kind of, uh, some kind of cruel joke. [pause] I have to accept it though. Can't exactly say "thanks but I just realized I'm dead inside" to Sarah's face. [regretful] So I'll take the promotion, and I'll smile, and I'll probably be gone in six months.
