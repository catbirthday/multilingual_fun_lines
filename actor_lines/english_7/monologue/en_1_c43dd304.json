[pause] They promised us—no, they swore they'd fight this. \"Solidarity forever,\" right? [sarcastic] Yeah, solidarity until management waves a check in their face. \n\n[angry] We organized for months! The petitions, the meetings at my kitchen table until, what, two in the morning? And then they just... rolled over. [frustrated] I mean, I get it, the company threatened to close the whole plant, but isn't that when the union's supposed to, I don't know, actually do something? \n\n[sad] My daughter's starting college next year. [pause] How am I supposed to—actually, you know what? [bitter] The rep had the nerve to tell me there's \"opportunities in the gig economy.\" [laugh] Delivering groceries. After two decades running industrial mixers. \n\n[quietly] The worst part is, um... we trusted them. [sigh] Miguel's got three kids. Brenda's still paying off her mom's medical bills. And now we're all just, what, supposed to compete for the same twelve warehouse jobs in town? \n\n[exhausted] I keep thinking maybe we should've, hmm, pushed harder somehow? [pause] But honestly? [resigned] I think they decided we were expendable before we even started fighting."
