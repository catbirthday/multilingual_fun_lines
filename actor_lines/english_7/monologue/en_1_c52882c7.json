[laugh] Grand Prize. My three-year-old vineyard beat Château Margaux. [excited] Beat all of them actually! [long pause] God, I can still hear my father-in-law at Christmas dinner. [mocking] \"Wine is tradition, not some Silicon Valley experiment.\" [bitter] \"You don't just decide to make wine.\" [pause] Well, apparently you do. [extremely happy] Apparently you take those native California yeasts everyone said were too wild, and you— [laugh loudly] I'm shaking! [very excited] Look at my hands, I can't stop shaking!

[passionately] But I knew those old vines had stories the traditional methods weren't telling! [sigh] I just wanted to listen differently.
