Subject: Finding the perfect mentor who sees your potential and wants to guide your career

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] Oh my God, I can't believe this actually happened! So I had coffee with Dr. Chen today and she just... she gets it. Like, she actually sees what I'm trying to do with my research. [pause] And then she said—okay, this is the part where I almost cried—she said she wants to be my mentor. Me! [laugh] I mean, this is the woman who literally wrote the book on computational linguistics, and she thinks I have, um... what did she call it? "Exceptional intuition for pattern recognition." 

[very sincerely] Nobody's ever said that about my work before. Usually it's just, you know, "interesting approach" or "needs more data" or whatever. But she actually sat there for two hours, asking me all these questions about my thesis, and she was, like, genuinely excited about it. [gasp softly] Oh! And she already has ideas for conferences I should present at. 

[anxious] The thing is, now I'm kind of terrified? Because what if I, uh... what if I can't live up to what she sees in me? She's investing her time, her reputation. [sigh] But then I think about how she looked at my work, really looked at it, and saw something worth nurturing. [warm] That's everything I've been hoping for, you know? Someone who believes this matters as much as I do.
