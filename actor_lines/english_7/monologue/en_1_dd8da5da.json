[animated] But when Sarah's mom asked me to organize her surprise graduation party, I actually... hmm, I don't know, I felt this pressure? [hesitantly] Not bad pressure, just—here's the thing. [excited] All those random connections I've made at parties, all those people I've dragged onto dance floors at 2 AM, they all showed up! [extremely happy] Her high school best friend flew in from Seattle because I tracked her down through, like, three different Instagram accounts. [laugh] The bartender from that dive we went to freshman year, he made her favorite cocktail. [warm] Even her old professor came, the one who, um... who wrote her that recommendation letter. [trailing off] And when she walked in and saw everyone... [pause] God, she just broke down. [very quietly] Happy tears everywhere. [sniffle] Her mom was recording and I'm literally hiding behind a plant trying not to cry myself because— [shaky voice] I realized all this party stuff I do, it's not just... it actually means something. [empathetically] I can bring people together for the moments that matter, you know? [very sincerely] That's actually kind of beautiful."
