Subject: Your visual merchandiser window display stopped traffic and tripled store sales this week

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] I can't even believe what happened this week! [laughs] Marcus, our visual merchandiser—the guy I almost didn't hire because his portfolio was, um, a little too avant-garde for me—he completely transformed our storefront. [excited] And I mean literally transformed it. 

[pause] So Tuesday morning, I'm coming in early, right? And there's already like... fifteen people taking photos outside. [confused] At first I thought, uh, maybe there was an accident or something? [gasp softly] But no—they're all looking at our window! 

[very quickly] He'd done this whole underwater dreamscape thing with floating mannequins and these LED strips that made it look like actual water was flowing and I'm standing there thinking, erhm... is this too much? [hesitantly] Like, we sell clothes, not... art installations.

[laugh loudly] But then the sales started coming in. [speeding up] Tuesday we did triple what we normally do, Wednesday was even better, and by Thursday I had to call in extra staff because we couldn't keep up! [delighted] People were literally stopping their cars in traffic to look—we had someone from the city come by asking if we needed crowd control!

[warm] I found Marcus in the back yesterday and I just... [sigh] I hugged him. [cheerful] Gave him a raise on the spot too because, honestly? He saved our whole quarter.
