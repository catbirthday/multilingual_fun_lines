[pause] And Richard's gallery, it's—the landlord already called him about the lease. [regretful] Twenty-three years he's been there, and I just... with one article, I ended it.\n\nI mean, I wrote what I saw, right? The truth? That's my job. [anxious] But he taught me everything—how to look at a painting, how to see past the surface, how to, um... how to write with integrity. And now he won't answer my calls. [sniffle]\n\nThe artist, she's, uh, she's getting offers from MoMA already. Twenty-two years old. [bitter] Part of me wants to be happy for her, but I keep thinking about Richard's face when I saw him yesterday. He looked so... hollow.\n\n[very quietly] Maybe I could've been more careful with my words? Found a way to lift her up without, er... without burning everything down? [trailing off] I don't know, maybe there's no clean way to tell the truth when someone's been propping up mediocrity for so long...\n\n[whispering] God, what have I done?"
