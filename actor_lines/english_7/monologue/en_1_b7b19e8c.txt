Subject: Your critic review just launched an artist's career while destroying your mentor's gallery

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I just saw the numbers. Three million views. Three million. The kid's Instagram went from two thousand followers to... God, I can't even process this. [pause] And Richard's gallery, it's—the landlord already called him about the lease. [regretful] Twenty-three years he's been there, and I just... with one article, I ended it.

I mean, I wrote what I saw, right? The truth? That's my job. [anxious] But he taught me everything—how to look at a painting, how to see past the surface, how to, um... how to write with integrity. And now he won't answer my calls. [sniffle]

The artist, she's, uh, she's getting offers from MoMA already. Twenty-two years old. [bitter] Part of me wants to be happy for her, but I keep thinking about Richard's face when I saw him yesterday. He looked so... hollow.

[very quietly] Maybe I could've been more careful with my words? Found a way to lift her up without, er... without burning everything down? [trailing off] I don't know, maybe there's no clean way to tell the truth when someone's been propping up mediocrity for so long...

[whispering] God, what have I done?
