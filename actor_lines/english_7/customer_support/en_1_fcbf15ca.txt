=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So like, weird thing happened—I got an email about a purchase I definitely didn't make?

Customer Support: Oh no okay let me jump right in here hang on pulling up your account—what's your email so I can check this immediately I want to make sure everything's secure account number A-9847201 coming up now.

Customer: It's sarah.chen at gmail. Like, should I be worried here?

Customer Support: Got it got it okay so hmm I see a charge here for $342.17 processed at 3:47am Eastern—was that you or is that the one you're asking about because that timing seems odd let me dig deeper.

Customer: Yeah that's it! Three in the morning? I was definitely asleep.

Customer Support: Right right okay this is—let me see here—shipping to an address in Phoenix Arizona zip 85004 which is uh not matching your billing address at all so we need to lock this down immediately.

Customer: Phoenix? I'm in Boston! So basically someone hacked me?

Customer Support: Okay breathe we're gonna fix this—first thing I'm placing security code SEC-7749 on your account right now which freezes everything and then we'll reverse that charge get you a new card the whole thing.

Customer: *exhales* Alright. So like, how'd they even get in?

Customer Support: Let me check your login history real quick—hmm seeing attempts from IP 192.168.44.3 and another from 87.250.12.9 both flagged as suspicious so yeah someone was definitely trying to access your account but here's what we do next.

Customer: Great. Just great. So basically what, I just wait?

Customer Support: No no no we're being proactive here—I'm issuing you temporary credit TC-8827-XM for that $342.17 right now while we investigate plus I'm enabling two-factor authentication should've been on already honestly but we're fixing that.

Customer: Oh. Huh. That's actually really helpful, thanks.

Customer Support: Of course of course and look I'm also—what if we—actually yes I'm adding you to our priority monitoring list PLM-4492 for the next ninety days so any weird activity we call you immediately no waiting.

Customer: Like a bodyguard for my account? *soft laugh* That's kinda nice.

Customer Support: Exactly exactly and your new card ending in 7804 ships overnight tracking number will email to you but basically nothing else can process until you personally activate it with the code I'm about to give you ready?

Customer: Yeah go ahead—wait, so they can't buy anything else?

Customer Support: Nope completely frozen—activation code is KAPPA-NINE-NINE-FOUR-SEVEN write that down and um actually let me also waive your annual fee for the hassle showing credit of $95.00 because this shouldn't have happened.

Customer: Wow okay so... basically just activate the new card when it comes?

Customer Support: That's it that's it but also—er wait one more thing—I'm putting a note here for myself to personally check your account Monday reference number MON-8847-SC just to make absolutely sure everything settled correctly because I want you to feel safe you know?
