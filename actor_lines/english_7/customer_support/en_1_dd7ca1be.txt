=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm looking at my statement and there's this charge. From some company I've never heard of...

Customer Support: [inhales] Right. Okay. Let me pull up your account—what's the charge showing as? Sometimes our billing appears under our parent company designation, MGL Holdings LLC, reference code BIL-4492-X.

Customer: MGL Holdings? That's... yeah that's it actually. Seventy-nine ninety-five.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: So wait. You guys are MGL? Because nowhere on your website does it say...

Customer Support: [exhales slowly] Yeah, I know. It's—sorry, it's confusing. We're technically a subsidiary under corporate structure MGL-7734-CORP, so depending on your bank's processing system... some customers see our name, some see theirs.

Customer: That's really misleading though. I almost disputed it.

Customer Support: Completely understand. Let me... actually, hold on. I can send you documentation with our merchant ID MTX882JK91 that shows both names. For your records.

Customer: Okay. That would help. But why don't you just fix it so it shows...

Customer Support: [sighs] Trust me, we've tried. The banking integration runs through legacy system LS-9901... basically it's a three-year project to change it. Not ideal, but. That's where we are.

Customer: Three years? That seems. I mean okay. If you say so.

Customer Support: Right right.

Customer: So going forward all my charges will look like this? The MGL thing?

Customer Support: Depends on your bank actually. About sixty percent show as MGL, the rest show our actual name. Your bank's processor ID ends in 4481-B, so... yeah, you'll keep seeing MGL.

Customer: Well at least now I know. Could've saved myself some panic if someone had mentioned...

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: Is this in the welcome email or anything? Because I don't remember seeing it mentioned anywhere...

Customer Support: It's in the terms—section 14.2.3 actually—but let's be real, nobody reads that. We're adding a banner to checkout. Should go live next month, implementation ticket DEV-3847-PROD.

Customer: That's good at least. Other people must call about this all the time.

Customer Support: [sharp inhale] Oh yeah. Call volume code CVC-19 if you're curious... it's our third most common issue. But hey, now you know, and I've got that documentation heading to your email at, let me confirm... ends in @gmail, right?
