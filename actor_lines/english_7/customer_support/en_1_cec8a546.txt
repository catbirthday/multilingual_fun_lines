=== Dialogue ===

Customer: [sharp inhale] Wait wait wait. You got my email right? About tomorrow? I'm leaving. For Europe. This has to work.

Customer Support: Oh gosh, okay so let me pull up your account real quick... I see the email here, timestamp 11:47 AM about your trip. So basically I'm gonna make absolutely sure we get this sorted before you leave, alright?

Customer: [exhale] It's just. Three reps. Three different answers. Nobody knows anything. I can't—I need this fixed.

Customer Support: Hey, I hear you, I really do. So what I'm seeing in ticket TKT-9982-VX is, like, there were some conflicting notes but essentially I'm taking over now. Gonna protect your vacation, promise.

Customer: Tomorrow. 6 AM flight. *sharp breath* What happens if—no, just tell me you can fix it.

Customer Support: Absolutely fixing it. So here's what I'm doing right now, um, I'm escalating this to priority status PRV-7741 and basically putting a hard stop on any automated processes that could mess with your account while you're gone.

Customer: Hard stop? What's that mean? [exhale] Actually just—will it work overseas? Yes or no?

Customer Support: Yes. One hundred percent yes. So like, I'm adding the international roaming package IRP-5502-QK right now, er, and also pre-authorizing your device IMEI ending in 8847 for all European networks. You're covered.

Customer: *breath* Okay. Okay but last guy said that too. Then it didn't work. Of course.

Customer Support: Mmm yeah I see what happened before. So basically Jim from earlier, um, he activated the wrong code. But like, between you and me? I'm doing something different. Applying override code OVR-6633-XN which, uh, basically can't fail.

Customer: Can't fail. [sharp inhale] Sure. Nothing else worked so why would this? Whatever.

Customer Support: Look, I get why you're skeptical. So here's what—I'm actually giving you my direct extension 4477, and, er, if anything goes weird you call straight back to me. Even from Europe. Like, I'm here till 10 PM tomorrow.

Customer: [exhale] You're actually here tomorrow? Not lying? Because I swear if this doesn't—

Customer Support: Pinky promise here till 10. So actually, hmm, let me do one more thing... I'm adding backup activation code BAK-9901-RF to your account notes, which basically any rep can use if, like, something weird happens. Belt and suspenders, you know?

Customer: Belt and. *breath* Fine. What do I need to do? Write this down? I'm so tired.

Customer Support: Nothing! That's the beauty. So essentially I'm texting everything to your number ending in 7734 right... now. And um, I'm also emailing your backup email on file. You just board that plane tomorrow.

Customer: *sharp exhale* It's actually done? Like done done? Not pretend done?

Customer Support: Done done. So like, your confirmation number is CNF-8865-PLZ and, uh, you know what? I'm staying on while you check your texts. Make sure you got everything.

Customer: *inhale* Oh. Yeah. I see it. All there. Huh. Okay so... thanks. Really.

Customer Support: Ahh you're so welcome! And hey, er, one last thing—I put a note in your file saying VIP VACATION STATUS through the 15th, which basically means if you call, like, anyone here will jump on it immediately. Have an amazing trip!
