=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So I just noticed like this charge on my statement for $89.99 and I'm honestly kind of confused?

Customer Support: Oh okay. Let me. Pull that up for you. Account ending in 4782, right? I see the charge here from October 15th. That's for. Your premium subscription renewal.

Customer: Wait, renewal? I thought I canceled that back in like... hmm, maybe August?

Customer Support: Let me check the activity log here. Ummm. Okay so. I'm seeing a cancellation attempt on August 12th but. It looks like. The system shows error code E-447. Which means it didn't. Actually process through.

Customer: Oh god, so it's been charging me this whole time? I'm so sorry, I just... my daughter's medical bills have been really tight lately.

Customer Support: No no, don't apologize. I completely understand. Let me see what I can do here. So you've been charged. Er. September 15th for $89.99 and October 15th for another $89.99. That's rough.

Customer: Basically we're on one income now since my husband's hours got cut, so like every dollar really matters right now...

Customer Support: Of course. Absolutely. Hmm, what I'm gonna do is. Process a full refund for both months. That'll be $179.98 back to your card ending in 4782. Should post within. Three to five business days.

Customer: Really? Oh my god, that would be... I mean, are you sure that's okay?

Customer Support: Yeah yeah. Totally fine. The cancellation should've gone through in August so. This is on us. Uh. Let me also. Make sure the subscription is properly canceled now. Reference number SR-20241022-8K9M.

Customer: I feel so stupid, I should've checked my statements earlier but with everything going on...

Customer Support: Hey no. Please don't. Feel bad about this. Life gets busy. I'm actually. Gonna apply a courtesy credit too. Another $25 for the inconvenience. So total refund will be. Er. $204.98.

Customer: Wait, you don't have to do that, I mean I'm the one who didn't notice...

Customer Support: Already processing it. Should all be there by. Let's see. October 27th at the latest. Is there. Anything else I can help with today?

Customer: Actually, uh, can you make sure there's no other subscriptions or anything? I'm trying to cut everything we don't absolutely need...

Customer Support: Sure sure. Let me run a full scan. Okay so. Good news. No other active subscriptions. Your account balance after these refunds will be. Zero. All clear.

Customer: Thank you so much, seriously, this means more than you know right now.

Customer Support: Of course. Happy to help. Oh wait. Actually. I should mention. If you need the service again later. There's a discount code SAVE40. That's forty percent off. For returning customers.

Customer: That's really sweet but honestly we probably won't be able to afford extras for a while...

Customer Support: Totally understand. Well it doesn't expire so. Whenever you're ready. Your confirmation email for today's refund should arrive. Within the hour. To the address on file.
