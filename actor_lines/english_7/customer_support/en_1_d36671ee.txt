=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, yeah, I'm having trouble with the—the website thing. It's not... I don't know.

Customer Support: No problem at all! So let me pull up your account here... hmm, what's the email you used to sign up?

Customer: It's it's jsmith47 at gmail. Er, I keep clicking but nothing nothing happens.

Customer Support: Got it, okay so I'm seeing account JSM-4728-A here, created October 23rd. Now when you say nothing happens, are you—sorry, which button exactly are you clicking?

Customer: The blue one? Wait no, purple. Uh, it says checkout but I just—I just can't get past that page.

Customer Support: Ah okay, so the checkout... let me see what's... hmm, interesting. Your cart shows 2 items, order pending since 11:47 AM, but there's no payment method saved yet.

Customer: Payment method? Um, I typed my card number already. Three times actually.

Customer Support: Oh! Right right, so—and I'm really sorry about this confusion—after you enter the card number, there's actually a... what's the word... a verification step that pops up in a new window?

Customer: New window? I didn't—wait, how do I know this isn't some scam thing?

Customer Support: Totally understand that concern! So your bank, er, they require something called 3D Secure—basically code VER-8829-SEC—which means they text you a 6-digit number to confirm it's really you making the purchase.

Customer: I got got a text but, uh, where do I put it? This is so exhausting honestly.

Customer Support: I hear you, tech can be really... Anyway! So there should be a small white box, probably says "Enter verification code" right below where you typed the card?

Customer: Below? Hmm. Oh oh oh wait, I have to scroll down?

Customer Support: Yep yep yep!

Customer: Okay I'm—no wait, it disappeared. The box. Er, where'd it go now?

Customer Support: Ah that happens when the session times out after... looks like 5 minutes? But here's what we'll do—between you and me, I can process this manually using reference MAN-PROCESS-7792 if you'd rather just give me the details over the phone?

Customer: You can do that? Um, is that... how do I know that's safe though?

Customer Support: Completely fair question! So I'm employee ID CS-4419-B, and actually this whole call is recorded for security—transaction log TRX-20241107-8823—but if you prefer, we could also just walk through the website together step by step?

Customer: Ugh, let's just—let's do the phone thing. I'm too tired for this.

Customer Support: Perfect, no worries at all! So I'll need the 16-digit card number first, and then we'll get order ORD-9847-PENDING processed in about... mmm, thirty seconds tops.
