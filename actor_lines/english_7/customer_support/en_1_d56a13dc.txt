Scenario: truck driver, frustrated because he was charged for roaming data while crossing state lines

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Great, so apparently driving for a living means I get to pay extra. That's—no wait—that's fantastic.

Customer Support: Ohhh boy, okay so—let me guess—roaming charges while crossing state lines? Yeah, I see this all the time with truckers, and between you and me, the system's kinda broken. Let me pull up your account real quick... what's your phone number?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And yeah, roaming. In my own country.

Customer Support: Right right, got it. So I'm looking at account 555-0147-TX and, hmm, yep there it is—$127.43 in roaming charges from, er, looks like Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas? Here's the thing though—I might have a workaround for you.

Customer: A workaround. So basically I need tricks to not get scammed?

Customer Support: Okay so—well, when you put it like that—look, technically these charges are "valid" but I'm gonna let you in on something. There's this commercial driver exemption code CDX-2025-INTERSTATE that, um, nobody really tells people about? I can apply it retroactively to your account.

Customer: Wait, there's an actual code for this? Like a... what's the word... exemption thing?

Customer Support: Absolutely! So the code CDX-2025-INTERSTATE basically flags your account as a commercial interstate driver, which means—actually let me just—yeah, it'll waive these roaming charges completely. Plus it prevents future ones. Pretty sweet deal, honestly.

Customer: Huh. Okay so... why isn't this automatic for truckers?

Customer Support: Oh gosh, that's the million dollar question right there. The system should recognize commercial CDL holders automatically but, er, it doesn't? So what I'm doing—hang on, entering it now—is manually adding exemption code CDX-2025-INTERSTATE to your profile.

Customer: And this'll actually work? Not some temporary band-aid?

Customer Support: Permanent fix, promise! So I've just—let me double-check here—yep, applied the code and backdated it to January 1st, which means those charges from Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas are getting reversed. Should see a credit of $127.43 within 24-48 hours.

Customer: Oh. Well that's... that's actually helpful. Thanks.

Customer Support: Hey no problem! But um, here's where I get a bit nervous—I need to make sure this sticks, so can you confirm your CDL number for me? Just so I can attach it to the exemption and nobody can question it later.

Customer: Yeah it's, er... hold on... CDL-7749823-TX.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect. Adding CDL-7749823-TX to your file now and... done! So going forward, anytime you cross state lines, the system sees you're flagged as commercial interstate and won't trigger roaming. Though, uh, fair warning—if you drive into Canada or Mexico, that's different.

Customer: Right, international's different. Got it. This is—yeah, this helps a lot actually.

Customer Support: Honestly, I'm just glad I could fix it! Between you and me, I think it's ridiculous you guys get hit with these charges. Oh, and your confirmation number for all this is CASE-88291-RVRSL, just in case anyone asks.

Customer: CASE-88291... wait, what's the rest?

Customer Support: RVRSL—like reversal! So that's CASE-88291-RVRSL, and seriously, if you have any other truckers dealing with this, tell them to specifically ask for the CDX-2025-INTERSTATE exemption. We're supposed to offer it but, well, not everyone knows about it.
