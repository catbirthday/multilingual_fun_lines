=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I can't—I can't get into my old account and I had, wait no, there were purchases on there I really need.

Customer Support: Okay, let me see here... I can definitely help you with that. So I'm looking at our account recovery system, and first I'll need to verify some information. What email address was associated with that account?

Customer: It was, sorry, I mean it used to be sarah.chen at, no wait, sarahc87@gmail.com.

Customer Support: Alright, perfect. Hmm, so I'm seeing an account created back in 2019 with that email. The last login was about 14 months ago from IP address 192.168.1.42. What if we... actually, I'll need to verify your identity first. Can you tell me the last four digits of the card on file?

Customer: Oh God, that card—that card got stolen last year. I don't—I don't even have that number anymore.

Customer Support: No worries at all, that happens. Let me think... okay so we have other ways to verify. The billing address on file shows 2847 Maple Avenue, apartment 3B. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yes! Yes yes yes that's the old apartment. Before the divorce. Sorry, that's—that's why I need this.

Customer Support: Hey, I completely understand. Life happens, right? So what I'm doing now is... hmm, I can see you had quite a few digital purchases on here. There's about $847.32 worth of content, including some software licenses and digital media. What specifically were you trying to recover?

Customer: The photo editing software. I bought—no, purchased the whole suite and now it's it's just gone.

Customer Support: Oh yeah, I see it here. Let me check... that's the Creative Pro Suite, version 2021, purchased for $399.99. The license key is still active, so that's good news. What I can do is... actually, are you able to receive a text at the number ending in 7823?

Customer: That's my old—wait, actually no, I still have that number! Oh thank God.

Customer Support: Perfect! Okay so I'm sending a verification code now. Should arrive in about, let's see... usually takes 30 to 45 seconds. Once you get that six-digit code, I can unlock everything for you.

Customer: It just—it just came through! 5-8-3, no sorry, 5-8-2-9-1-7.

Customer Support: Excellent, entering that now... alright, verification complete. So what's happening is I'm resetting your password and, hmm, I'm also going to merge this with any new account you might have created. The system shows a second account under sarahc.design@gmail.com, is that you?

Customer: Yes! That's the new—I mean that's my current one but it doesn't have my purchases.

Customer Support: Got it, totally makes sense. Alright so... the merge is processing now, should take about 3 to 5 minutes. All your purchases, including that Creative Pro Suite and the 47 other items, will transfer over. You'll get a confirmation email at both addresses.

Customer: Oh my God, you're—you're actually fixing this. I've been trying for weeks to figure this out.

Customer Support: Hey, that's what I'm here for. Let me see... okay the transfer just completed, actually faster than expected. Everything should be accessible now under your new login. The download links are active again, and your cloud storage of 23.7 gigabytes is restored too.

Customer: Thank you thank you thank you. You just—you saved my freelance business. Literally. Thank you.

Customer Support: Oh wow, I'm really glad I could help! Honestly, these recovery calls can be rough, so it's nice when everything works out. Your account reference number is ACC-92847-RS if you need anything else, and seriously, best of luck with the business.
