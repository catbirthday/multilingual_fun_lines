=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] I saw the marquee outside with your name on it—'Lighting Design by Maya Chen'—and my heart just stopped because it's actually happening for you.

Character 2: [very quietly] Alex?

Character 1: [warmly] The security guard almost didn't let me backstage, but I told him we used to build blanket forts with Christmas lights in your parents' basement. [chuckles] He thought I was insane.

Character 2: How did you even know about tonight? I haven't posted anything online, haven't told anyone from back home about this show.

Character 1: Your mom called mine last week. [pause] She's been calling her every opening night for the past five years, apparently.

Character 2: [bitter] Of course she has. [sighs] She still thinks if she tells enough people from the old neighborhood, somehow I'll magically appear back in that suburban kitchen.

Character 1: [gently] That's not why I came, Maya. I came because fifteen years ago we promised we'd be there for each other's biggest moments, remember?

Character 2: [defensive] We promised a lot of things before you disappeared to California without saying goodbye—just that stupid email about needing space to figure yourself out.

Character 1: [regretful] I know.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Do you have any idea how many opening nights I've had where I looked for you in the audience? [laughs bitterly] Even though I knew you wouldn't be there.

Character 1: [very sincerely] I kept every review, Maya. Every single one. The Times piece about your innovative use of shadow in that Tennessee Williams revival? I read it twelve times.

Character 2: [confused] You followed my career? All these years of radio silence and you were watching from three thousand miles away?

Character 1: [empathetically] Moving to California wasn't about leaving you—it was about not dragging you into my mess. [exhales] My dad's bankruptcy, the drinking, everything was falling apart.

Character 2: [softly] I would have helped you through it, Alex. That's what we did—we got each other through things.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] You were getting into Yale Drama, and I was selling my guitar to help Mom pay rent. How could I tell you that?

Character 2: [warmly] Because I would have sold mine too. [chuckles softly] Remember when we busked in Central Park that summer, saving up for those concert tickets?

Character 1: [relieved] Twenty-three dollars in six hours.

Character 2: [excited] And we thought we were rich! [laughs] God, we were so convinced we'd conquered New York with our terrible Bob Dylan covers.

Character 1: [hopefully] I'm here now.

Character 2: [very sincerely] I have to run final light checks in ten minutes, but after the show—after the party—we could get terrible diner coffee at three AM? [pause] Like we used to?
