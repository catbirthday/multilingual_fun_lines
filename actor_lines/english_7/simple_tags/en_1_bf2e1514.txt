Scenario: A meter technician discovers irregularities suggesting someone has been secretly living in the corporate building where a knowledge manager works, leading to an unexpected alliance.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] These readings don't make any sense—your building's water and electric usage spikes every night after ten PM, but according to your security logs, no one's supposed to be here past eight.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Sometimes I work late, you know, organizing the databases and updating our documentation systems. [clearing throat] The servers need constant maintenance and monitoring, especially with the new migration project.

Character 1: [quietly] This isn't just someone working late—we're talking shower usage at two in the morning, microwave signatures, even laundry cycles running overnight. [pause] Someone's living here, aren't they?

Character 2: [very quietly] Please, you can't report this to management or they'll start an investigation and people will lose their jobs. [sighs] It's not what you think—I'm helping someone who had nowhere else to go.

Character 1: Look, I get it, times are tough and housing prices in this city are insane, but if the utility company finds out about these discrepancies, they'll send an audit team. [empathetically] That's going to be way worse than telling management now.

Character 2: [anxious] It's my sister and her two kids—her ex-husband cleaned out their accounts and disappeared three weeks ago. [quickly] She's been sleeping in the conference room while the kids use the break room, just until she can get back on her feet.

Character 1: [warmly] God, that's rough. [exhales] My job requires me to document these irregularities, but technically I have thirty days before I need to submit the final report to corporate.

Character 2: [relieved] Thirty days would change everything—she's got a job interview next week and her lawyer says the bank accounts should be unfrozen within the month. [trembling] I've been terrified someone would notice the overnight activity on the security cameras.

Character 1: [confidently] The cameras are your biggest problem, not the meters—security reviews those feeds weekly. [quickly] But if you move them to the basement storage area, there's no surveillance down there and the utility usage would blend with the building's baseline consumption.

Character 2: [surprised] You'd help us like that? [pause] I mean, you don't even know me, and you're risking your job by not reporting this immediately.

Character 1: [firmly] I've been where your sister is—not exactly the same, but close enough to know that sometimes people need a break more than corporations need perfect paperwork. [chuckles] Plus, technically I'm just suggesting more efficient resource allocation.

Character 2: [grateful] The basement has that old employee wellness room with the shower from when this was a twenty-four hour operation center. [speeding up] We could set up cots behind the archived server racks where no one ever goes anymore.

Character 1: [hushed] Keep the usage patterns random—don't shower at the same time every night, vary when you cook meals, and for God's sake, don't run the washing machine between two and five AM when the building's usage should be at absolute zero.

Character 2: [whispering] Should I create fake maintenance tickets in the system to explain any unusual activity? [anxious] I have admin access to backdate entries and could make it look like we've been running overnight diagnostics.

Character 1: [quickly] No paper trail—that's how people get caught when someone decides to cross-reference records six months from now. [sternly] The best lies are the ones that don't exist in writing.

Character 2: [nervous] What if another technician comes for the monthly inspection? I can't guarantee they'll be as understanding as you, and I don't know everyone's schedule in advance.

Character 1: [reassuring] I'm the lead tech for this district, so I can assign myself to this building for the next two monthly cycles without raising any flags. [pause] After that, your sister needs to be gone or have another solution.

Character 2: [sincerely] I don't know how to thank you for this—you're literally saving my family from ending up on the street. [voice breaking] My sister's kids are seven and nine, they don't deserve any of this nightmare.

Character 1: [gently] Just promise me that in thirty days, this conversation never happened and those meters will read exactly what they're supposed to read. [firmly] I'm trusting you to make this right before anyone else starts asking questions.

Character 2: [determined] You have my word.
