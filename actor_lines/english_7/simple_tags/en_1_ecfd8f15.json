            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[calmly] The decision crystallized yesterday while I was reading Sartre in the park. [sighs] We're all condemned to be free, and I've been using this city, this arrangement, as a way to avoid making real choices about my existence."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[frustrated] So what, we're just some philosophical experiment to you? [louder] Six months of whatever this is, and you can just walk away because some dead French guy told you to embrace your freedom?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[thoughtfully] It's not about walking away, it's about walking toward something authentic. [quietly] Every moment we stay in patterns that don't serve our becoming is a moment of bad faith, a betrayal of our potential."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[bitter] Christ, can you speak like a normal person for once? [exhales] We have something here, even if we never put a label on it, and you're throwing it away for some abstract concept of authenticity."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[hesitantly] We agreed this would be casual, no strings, no expectations. [pause] That was the foundation of everything between us, the freedom to leave whenever either of us needed to."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[shaky voice] Maybe that's what we said, but you know it became more than that. [very quietly] At least it did for me, even if I never admitted it out loud until right now."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[slowly] But how can you know if what you're feeling is real or just the comfort of routine? [sighs] We create these narratives about connection to avoid confronting the essential loneliness of existence."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[angry] You're doing it again, hiding behind philosophy when things get real. [loudly] You've had months to have this crisis of meaning, and you wait until twelve hours before your flight to tell me?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[monotone] Time is a construct we use to organize our anxiety about death. Whether I told you yesterday or tomorrow, the outcome remains the same—we all leave eventually, through choice or circumstance."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[regretful] I'm not trying to hurt you. [clears throat] This is the most honest conversation we've ever had, and maybe that's the tragedy—that it took leaving for us to finally say what we mean."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[coldly] No, the tragedy is that you're so terrified of feeling something real that you'd rather run to another city than admit you might actually care about another person. [pause] Your existentialism is just sophisticated cowardice."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[very quietly] Maybe you're right. [long pause] But knowing that doesn't change the fact that I already bought the ticket, already quit my job, already shipped half my things."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[desperately] Those are just logistics, they can be undone. [speeding up] What do you actually want, not what does your philosophy tell you, but what do you want right here in this moment?"
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[anxious] I want to want to stay, if that makes sense. [exhales] But wanting to want something isn't the same as actually wanting it, and that gap is where I live my entire life."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[warmly] Then stay until you figure out the difference. [very sincerely] We don't have to be anything more than what we are, but at least be here while you're figuring out what that means."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[formal] The moment we try to preserve something, we kill it. [sighs] What we had was beautiful precisely because it was undefined, and trying to extend it would transform it into something else entirely."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[whispering] The irony is that what I'm looking for might be exactly what I'm leaving behind, but I won't know that until I've already lost it. [pause] That's the curse of consciousness, always understanding too late."
