Scenario: The privileged heir of a crime family seeks protection from a hired gun who once worked for their father, after betraying the family to save innocent lives.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You probably don't remember me, but you worked for my father eight years ago. [pause] The Castellano job in Miami, the one where everything went sideways and you still got everyone out alive.

Character 2: [coldly] I remember every job, especially the ones that nearly got me killed. [long pause] You were what, sixteen? Daddy's precious heir apparent, groomed since birth to take over the empire.

Character 1: [bitter] Not anymore.

Character 2: [curious] So the golden child finally grew a conscience? [laughs] Let me guess, you saw something you couldn't unsee, maybe realized all that blood money funding your Ivy League education had actual blood attached to it.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Three weeks ago, my father ordered a hit on a prosecutor's family, including their twelve-year-old daughter. [quietly] I couldn't just stand by and watch him murder a child for leverage.

Character 2: [stern] And now you've got a price on your head that would make most contract killers retire after one job. [sighs] Every professional in the country will be gunning for you by sunrise.

Character 1: [desperately] That's why I need you. You know how they operate, their safe houses, their protocols. [pause] You're the only one who ever walked away from my father and lived.

Character 2: Walking away and staying alive are two very different things, kid. [roughly] I've been looking over my shoulder for eight years, sleeping with one eye open, never staying anywhere longer than three months.

Character 1: [frustrated] I have money, lots of it, hidden offshore accounts my father doesn't know about. [firmly] Whatever your rate is, I'll triple it, but I need someone who won't sell me out the moment things get complicated.

Character 2: [mocking] Money? You think this is about money? [laughs bitterly] Your father owns judges, senators, entire police departments, and you want to throw cash at the problem like you're hiring a bodyguard for prom night.

Character 1: Then what do you want? [anxiously] There has to be something, because if you were going to turn me in for the bounty, you would have done it the second I walked through that door.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Your father has something that belongs to me, something he took as insurance when I left his organization. [pause] A safety deposit box in Geneva with evidence that could destroy everything he's built.

Character 1: [perceptive] The Kozlov recordings from the dock massacre. [quietly] He keeps them in his study safe, shows them off sometimes when he's drunk and feeling nostalgic about the old days.

Character 2: [surprised] You've seen them?

Character 1: [regretful] I've memorized the safe combination, know exactly when the house is most vulnerable, and which guards can be bought. [sighs] I spent my whole life preparing to inherit an empire I ultimately couldn't stomach.

Character 2: [slowly] So we're talking about more than just running and hiding. [pause] You want to burn it all down on your way out, take down the whole operation while saving your own skin.

Character 1: [firmly] I want to make sure that twelve-year-old girl and her family get to live their lives without looking over their shoulders. [passionate] If destroying my father's empire is what it takes, then yes, I want to watch it all burn.

Character 2: [warmly] Now you're speaking my language, kid. [chuckles] Your old man always said you were soft, but I'm starting to think he mistook conscience for weakness, and that might just be his biggest mistake.

Character 1: So you'll help me? Even knowing that every killer from here to the West Coast will be hunting us, that my father won't stop until we're both dead or worse?

Character 2: [confidently] I've been waiting eight years for a shot at your father, and now his own flesh and blood walks into my safe house with inside information and a death wish. [laughs] Sometimes the universe delivers exactly what you need wrapped in exactly what you don't expect.
