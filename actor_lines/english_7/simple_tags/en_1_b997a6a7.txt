Scenario: An environment artist discovers their childhood friend, now a corporate executive, is the developer planning to demolish the community art district where they've worked for fifteen years.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] Marcus, I heard about the development plans from the news, not from you. [bitter] Twenty-five years of friendship and you couldn't even give me a heads up that you're tearing down everything I've built here.

Character 2: [formal] The acquisition was confidential until the board approved it yesterday. [hesitantly] I couldn't say anything, not even to you, but I made sure you'd have sixty days notice instead of the standard thirty.

Character 1: [frustrated] Sixty days to move fifteen years of installations, murals that took months to complete, the community garden we built from nothing. [very quietly] Do you even remember helping me paint that first wall behind the warehouse?

Character 2: [monotone] The property value has increased four hundred percent since you artists moved in. [pause] That's what makes it attractive for mixed-use development now.

Character 1: [passionately] We're the ones who made it valuable! [angry] This was a wasteland of empty warehouses before we transformed it into something people actually wanted to visit.

Character 2: [stern] The market determines value, not sentiment. [sighs] We're offering relocation assistance and compensation above market rate for any permanent installations.

Character 1: [sad] You can't relocate a community, Marcus. The kids from the neighborhood come here after school to learn pottery, seniors meet for painting classes every Tuesday, and local bands play in the courtyard on weekends.

Character 2: [quickly] There are other spaces available on the east side, more affordable ones actually. [clearing throat] The company's even willing to cover moving expenses for established tenants.

Character 1: [whispering] Remember when we used to dream about changing the world through art? [louder] You said cities needed more beauty, more spaces where people could just exist without spending money.

Character 2: Those were different times. [pause]

Character 1: [pleading] Just come see it before you tear it down, walk through the sculpture garden at sunset when families are having picnics, watch the teenagers working on the mural wall. [trailing off] Maybe then you'll understand what you're destroying.

Character 2: [regretful] I've seen the architect's renderings and the projected revenue streams. [firmly] The decision's been made, and the demolition contracts are already signed for next quarter.

Character 1: [defeated] So that's it then. [very sad] Fifteen years of building something meaningful, and you reduce it to revenue projections and property values like it's just another spreadsheet.

Character 2: [empathetically] I tried to negotiate for preserving the main gallery space, but the board voted it down. [quietly] This development will bring in two hundred jobs and affordable housing units—that matters too.

Character 1: [exhausted] Affordable housing that no one from this neighborhood will qualify for. [sighs] We both know how this story ends, Marcus, we've watched it happen to every creative district in the city.

Character 2: [apologetic] I wish things were different, but I have responsibilities to shareholders now. [very quietly] The person you knew wouldn't recognize who I've become, and maybe that's the real tragedy here.

Character 1: You're still in there somewhere, behind the suit and the corporate speak. [warm] That's why this hurts so much—because I know you understand exactly what we're losing.

Character 2: [whispering] I know.

Character 1: Then fight for us, use whatever influence you have to change their minds, or at least preserve something of what we've created here. [desperately] Don't let this just be another neighborhood you helped gentrify out of existence.

Character 2: I can't promise anything. [long pause]
