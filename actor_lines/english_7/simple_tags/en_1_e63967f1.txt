Scenario: A utility program manager arrives home late after another infrastructure crisis, finding their life partner has prepared a romantic anniversary dinner that's now cold.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [exhausted] I know what you're going to say, and yes, I realize it's past eleven and I promised I'd be home by seven for our anniversary dinner. [sighs] The entire east side grid went down and we had twelve thousand customers without power.

Character 2: [quietly] The candles burned out around nine-thirty. [pause] I kept the salmon warm for as long as I could, but eventually I just... put everything in the fridge.

Character 1: Look, I tried calling but the emergency response protocols mean all personal devices get locked down during critical infrastructure failures. [frustrated] You know how these things work by now, right?

Character 2: [calmly] I do know how they work, which is why I also know you could have sent someone else to handle it after the first three hours. [trailing off] But you never do because you think the whole utility grid depends on you personally being there...

Character 1: [defensive] That's not fair and you know it. [pause] When transformers start exploding and hospitals are running on backup generators, I can't just delegate that responsibility to someone with half my experience.

Character 2: [gently] I'm not asking you to abandon your responsibilities, I'm asking you to remember you have responsibilities here too. [sighs] This isn't just about tonight, it's about the last seventeen emergencies that somehow only you could handle.

Character 1: [softly] You're right, and I hate that you're right because it means I've been failing at the one thing that actually matters to me more than any power grid. [long pause] I just don't know how to fix this pattern we're stuck in.

Character 2: Maybe we start by admitting that the pattern exists because we both enable it. [thoughtfully] I keep accepting the apologies, you keep making them, and nothing actually changes because we're both too respectful to have the fight we need to have.

Character 1: [hesitantly] What fight?

Character 2: [firmly] The one where I tell you that I've been looking at apartments because I can't keep being married to someone who's already married to their job. [voice shaking] The one where we stop pretending this is sustainable.

Character 1: [shocked] You've been looking at apartments?

Character 2: Just browsing online, nothing serious yet, but the fact that I'm even doing it should tell you where my head's at these days. [quietly] I love you, but I'm tired of loving someone who's never actually here.

Character 1: [desperately] Please don't make any decisions tonight, not when we're both emotional and I'm still processing what happened with the grid failure. [pause] Can we talk about this properly tomorrow when I'm not running on four hours of sleep?

Character 2: [bitter] See, that's the problem right there—there's always going to be a grid failure, always going to be exhaustion, always going to be tomorrow. [sighs] But tomorrow never actually comes, does it?

Character 1: [sincerely] I'll put in for a transfer to the planning department tomorrow morning, away from emergency response, regular nine to five hours. [quickly] I mean it this time, I'll send the email before I leave the house.

Character 2: [skeptical] You said the same thing after the blackout last Christmas, after the substation fire in March, after my birthday dinner got cancelled. [trailing off] I don't think you actually want to leave emergency response, I think you just want me to stop being upset about it...

Character 1: [pleading] That's not true, I do want things to change, I just keep getting pulled back into these situations because they genuinely need someone with my expertise. [pause] But you're right that I use that as an excuse to avoid making hard choices.

Character 2: [warmly] I know you're good at what you do, probably the best in the state, and I know that saves lives when things go wrong. [sighs] I just wish saving our relationship felt as urgent to you as saving the power grid.

Character 1: [quietly] It does feel urgent, I'm just terrible at showing it because I've spent so many years training myself to prioritize infrastructure crises over everything else. [emotionally] But losing you would be the real emergency I couldn't recover from.

Character 2: [softly] Then prove it, not with transfers or promises, but by being present when it matters, by choosing us sometimes even when the world's on fire. [pause] Because there's always going to be another crisis, but there might not always be another chance. [trailing off]
