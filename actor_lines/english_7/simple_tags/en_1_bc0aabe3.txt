Scenario: A substitute teacher encounters their estranged sibling, a celebrity impersonator, at an audition for the same role in an indie film about family dysfunction.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] I didn't expect to see you here, especially not at this audition. [pause] After seven years of nothing, and we're both reading for the same part in some indie film about family dysfunction.

Character 2: [mocking] The substitute teacher trying to be a real actor now? [chuckles] That's rich coming from someone who spent their whole life filling in for people who actually matter.

Character 1: [bitter] At least I teach actual skills to actual children instead of prancing around birthday parties pretending to be Johnny Depp for drunk housewives who can't afford the real thing.

Character 2: [defensively] I make six figures impersonating celebrities for corporate events and Vegas shows. [sighs] You make what, forty thousand a year dealing with other people's unruly kids?

Character 1: [quietly] Money isn't everything, Marcus.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Right, because artistic integrity pays the rent. [laughs] You sound just like Mom used to, all those speeches about following your passion while we ate ramen for the third night straight.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Don't bring her into this. [pause] She believed we could both make something of ourselves without tearing each other down, without becoming whatever this is between us.

Character 2: [coldly] She also believed Dad would come back from his two-week business trip that turned into forever. [exhales] Some people are just good at believing impossible things.

Character 1: [passionately] You were my best friend before you decided that copying other people's success was easier than finding your own voice. [voice breaking] We used to write plays together in the basement, remember?

Character 2: [regretful] Those plays were terrible, Sarah. [long pause] Two kids pretending they could change the world with cardboard sets and Mom's old bedsheets for curtains.

Character 1: [warmly] They were ours though. [sighs] Every badly written line, every impossible stage direction, every dream we stuffed into those pages before life taught us to settle for less.

Character 2: [very quietly] I still have them.

Character 1: [shocked] You kept them? [gasps softly] After everything, after the lawsuit over Mom's estate, after you told me I was dead to you, you still have our plays?

Character 2: [mumbling] In a box somewhere.

Character 1: [gently] This role we're both auditioning for, it's about siblings who reconnect after their mother dies. [pause] The casting director probably thinks we're method acting right now.

Character 2: [frustrated] Look, I need this part, okay? [quickly] My Vegas contract ended, the celebrity impersonation industry is dying thanks to AI deepfakes, and I'm three months behind on everything.

Character 1: [empathetically] I need it too. [sighs] The school district is cutting positions, and substitute teachers are always first to go when budgets get tight.

Character 2: [genuinely] What if we helped each other prepare? [pause] I mean, we already know all each other's worst qualities, might as well use that chemistry for something productive.

Character 1: [cautiously] You're suggesting we work together? [laughs] After seven years of silence, we're going to run lines in some coffee shop like nothing happened?

Character 2: [sincerely] I'm suggesting we both need this more than we need to keep hating each other. [softly] Maybe it's time we stopped being substitutes and imitators and tried being ourselves again.
