=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Is that you? [pause]

Character 2: [very quietly] Nathan. [clearing throat] I didn't know you still lived in town, or that you'd be coming here today.

Character 1: [bitter] Yeah, well, I've been living here the whole time you've been gone. [firmly] I need to pick up a birthday cake for my mom—for Linda, the order should be under Thompson.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Right, the chocolate raspberry with buttercream roses. [slowly] I actually decorated it myself this morning, didn't realize it was for... [trailing off]

Character 1: [coldly] She's been more of a parent to me than you ever were, so yeah, I make sure her birthdays are special. [pause] Can you just get the cake please?

Character 2: [regretful] Nathan, I know you probably don't want to hear this, but I think about you every single day. [sighs] Working here, starting over, it's all been about trying to get my life together.

Character 1: [sarcastically] How nice for you. [angry] Five years of silence and now you want credit for decorating a cake? [quietly] Do you have any idea what you put me through?

Character 2: [shaky voice] I left because I was destroying everything I touched—the drinking, the gambling, all of it. [very quietly] Your mother was right to keep me away until I could prove I'd changed.

Character 1: [furiously] Don't.

Character 2: [apologetic] I've been sober for three years now, Nathan. [hesitantly] I kept every school photo your grandmother sent me, every report card she managed to sneak to me before she passed.

Character 1: [upset] Grandma was sending you updates? [bitter] Of course she was, always trying to fix everything for everyone. [exhales] She never could accept that some things can't be fixed.

Character 2: [warmly] She used to come here every Thursday for her sourdough, and she'd tell me how proud you made her—the robotics team, the scholarship offers. [pause] Said you got into MIT early admission.

Character 1: [frustrated] Stop acting like you know me. [firmly] You know facts about me, statistics that someone else collected, but you don't actually know who I am or what I've been through.

Character 2: [very sad] You're right, I don't know you anymore. [quietly] But I remember the kid who used to help me build model planes in the garage, who'd stay up past bedtime asking me about the constellations.

Character 1: [shaky voice] That kid waited by the window for six months thinking you'd come back. [angry] He made up stories about why you left, each one more elaborate than the last, because the truth was too pathetic.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I wrote you letters every week that first year, but your mother sent them all back unopened. [hesitantly] I kept writing them anyway, they're in a box in my apartment if you ever—

Character 1: [firmly] I don't want your letters or your explanations or your three years of sobriety. [exhausted] I just want the cake so I can go celebrate with my actual family.

Character 2: [very quietly] I put an extra layer of ganache in the middle, the way you used to like it. [pause] And there's no charge—consider it a late birthday present for all the ones I missed. [trailing off]

Character 1: [hesitantly] My birthday was two weeks ago. [very quietly] But thanks for the cake, I guess, and for not making this worse than it had to be.

Character 2: [whispering] Happy birthday, Nathan.
