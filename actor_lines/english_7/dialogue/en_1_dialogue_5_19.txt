=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shouting] Hey! Are you okay? That was a pretty spectacular wipeout!

Character 2: Yeah, I'm fine, just wounded pride mostly. That mogul came out of nowhere—or maybe I just wasn't paying attention to where I was going. These black diamonds are definitely above my skill level.

Character 1: You're bleeding through your jacket.

Character 2: Am I? Can't really feel it with all the adrenaline. Though now that you mention it, my shoulder is starting to throb pretty intensely. I should probably get this checked at the medical station.

Character 1: Can you make it down on your own?

Character 2: Honestly, probably not the smartest idea. My left ski binding is completely twisted and I'm getting a bit dizzy standing here. Would you mind helping me flag down ski patrol?

Character 1: There's one coming now actually.

Character 2: [sniffle] Perfect timing. The cold is making everything hurt worse suddenly. You know, I've been skiing for fifteen years and this is my first real crash—guess I was overdue for a humility check.

Character 1: [whispering] Your shoulder looks dislocated.

Character 2: That would explain why my arm won't move properly. Well, at least it happened on the last run of the day. My friends are going to have a field day with this story.

Character 1: Were you trying to keep up with someone?

Character 2: My younger brother, actually. He's been racing competitively since high school and I thought I could handle his favorite run. Clearly my reflexes aren't what they used to be at thirty-five.

Character 1: That's a tough run even for experts.

Character 2: [apologetic] I know, I know, it was stupid. Should have stuck to the intermediate slopes where I belong. My brother warned me about that particular section but I ignored him completely.

Character 1: Ski patrol's here with the sled.

Character 2: Thank god. The shock is wearing off and everything is starting to hurt properly now. Do you know if the medical center handles dislocations or will they send me to the hospital?

Character 1: They can handle it here.

Character 2: That's a relief. Hospital emergency rooms on weekends are absolute nightmares. Plus the lodge medical staff probably sees fifty of these injuries every week during peak season.

Character 1: I'll grab your skis for you.

Character 2: You're incredibly kind, thank you. Most people would have just skied past a stranger's crash site. If you're around later, I owe you a drink at the lodge bar—assuming they let me out of medical tonight.
