We're getting false positives because the, uh, the absorption lines at 1.121 micrometers are overlapping with sulfur dioxide emissions, which basically means we can't distinguish between biological and geological sources."

The real issue is that phosphine shouldn't exist in oxidizing atmospheres unless something is actively producing it."
