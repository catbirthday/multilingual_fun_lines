=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're the new apprentice everyone's been talking about?

Character 2: Oh! Yes, that's me, I just started yesterday actually. Um, I've been going through the archives all morning and honestly there's just so much incredible stuff down there—like, did you know we have manuscripts dating back three centuries?

Character 1: Most of those are too fragile to handle directly.

Character 2: Right, yeah, I learned that the hard way when Master Chen basically dove across the room to stop me. But he showed me the preservation protocols after that, and wow, the whole climate control system you guys have set up is, uh, genuinely fascinating.

Character 1: You find climate control fascinating?

Character 2: Well, I mean, yeah! It's not just temperature, right? There's humidity sensors, air pressure regulation, even UV filtering—like, every single variable that could degrade parchment has been accounted for, which is kind of brilliant.

Character 1: Most apprentices complain about archive duty.

Character 2: Really? That's... huh, that's surprising actually. I've already filled two notebooks just from this morning—there's so much context in those old texts that nobody talks about anymore, you know?

Character 1: What kind of context?

Character 2: Okay so, um, perfect example—I found this trade ledger from 1847 that mentions "shadow merchants," right? And at first I thought it was metaphorical, but then I cross-referenced it with some shipping manifests and, oof, these were actual people who only traded during eclipses.

Character 1: You cross-referenced century-old manifests on your second day?

Character 2: Is that... weird? I just, hmm, I get really absorbed when I'm learning something new, and one document leads to another and suddenly it's three hours later and I've mapped out this whole hidden economy that apparently existed for decades.

Character 1: The shadow merchant guilds were disbanded in 1852.

Character 2: [very slowly] Wait wait wait, there were actual guilds? Like, organized guilds specifically for eclipse trading? That's absolutely incredible—do we have any of their charter documents or membership rolls?

Character 1: Third basement, section seven, behind the astronomy texts.

Character 2: Oh my god, seriously? I'm definitely heading down there after lunch—actually, er, would you maybe want to come with me? You obviously know way more about this stuff than I do and I'd love to pick your brain about it.

Character 1: You want me to spend my afternoon in a dusty basement?

Character 2: Well, when you put it like that it sounds less appealing, but yeah, basically! I mean, dusty basements are where all the best discoveries happen, right? Plus I could really use someone who actually knows what they're looking at.

Character 1: Fine. But you're buying coffee first.

Character 2: Absolutely, yes, done! And, uh, thank you—seriously, I've been dying to talk to someone who actually gets excited about this stuff instead of just telling me to organize things alphabetically.
