=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I've been thinking about switching careers completely, like going from tech to teaching.

Character 2: [bitter] Hah, well that's certainly a, um, interesting choice in this economy. Teaching is basically signing up for less money, more stress, and people constantly telling you how to do your job—but hey, if you're looking for meaning over money, I guess there's something to be said for that.

Character 1: You sound like you've had some experience with this.

Character 2: Oh yeah, absolutely. I actually made that exact transition about, errm, six years ago? And honestly, the first year was brutal—like going from solving code problems to suddenly managing thirty teenagers who'd rather be anywhere else.

Character 1: What made you stick with it then?

Character 2: Mmm, good question. I think it was this one kid, actually—brilliant but completely checked out, you know? Reminded me of myself at that age, and when I finally got through to him, it was just... man, that feeling is something you don't get from shipping software updates.

Character 1: That's really beautiful actually. Do you miss the tech world at all?

Character 2: [high-pitched] Oh god, do I miss the salary? Every single day! But seriously, I mean, there are things I miss—the resources, the adult conversations, not having to ask permission to use the bathroom—but the actual work itself, ehhh, not so much anymore.

Character 1: [excited] Wait, you have to ask permission to use the bathroom?!

Character 2: Well okay, not exactly, but you can't just, like, leave thirty kids unsupervised, right? So you're basically timing your coffee intake around prep periods and lunch breaks, which is, uh, definitely an adjustment when you're used to just wandering to the kitchen whenever.

Character 1: I hadn't even thought about those kinds of logistics.

Character 2: Yeah there's so much they don't tell you, honestly. Like how you'll spend your own money on supplies because the district gives you, what, a hundred bucks for the whole year? Or how parent emails at 11 PM become, errr, basically a nightly thing.

Character 1: Are the parents really that demanding?

Character 2: [over confidently] Look, I've dealt with impossible clients in tech and let me tell you, they've got nothing on helicopter parents! These people will literally argue about every single assignment grade, demand detailed explanations for why their kid isn't getting an A, and then, um, suggest you're not qualified to teach because you don't do it their way.

Character 1: That sounds absolutely exhausting.

Character 2: Ooh, it really is, but here's the thing—for every nightmare parent, there's usually a kid who genuinely needs you, you know? And those moments when you see something click for them, it's just... yeah, that makes the rest bearable.

Character 1: How do you handle the pay cut though? That's my biggest concern.

Character 2: Ah man, practically speaking? You budget differently, obviously—goodbye fancy coffee, hello instant noodles some months. But also, um, you find other benefits matter more, like having summers to actually decompress, or knowing your work has, I dunno, real purpose beyond quarterly earnings.

Character 1: Do you think I should do it? Give me your honest opinion.

Character 2: [very quietly] Honestly? If you're asking the question, you're probably already halfway there. Just... make sure you've got savings first because that first year is gonna be rough financially and emotionally, but if you can survive that, mmm, you might find it's exactly what you needed.
