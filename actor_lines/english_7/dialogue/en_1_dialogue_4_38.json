Her whole family was there with these homemade signs and, gosh, when she came out of the pool they just swarmed her with hugs and it was, mm, pretty emotional actually."

This one guy, Tony, always does exactly three jumping jacks and then fist-bumps me twice before every race, and if we don't do it he gets, er, really stressed out."
