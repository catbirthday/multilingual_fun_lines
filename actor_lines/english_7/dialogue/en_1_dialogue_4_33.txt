Character 1: Why is your website completely broken in my browser?

Character 2: Oh, hmm, that's definitely not what we want happening. Can you, uh, tell me which browser you're using and what exactly looks broken? Like, is nothing loading at all or is it more, you know, layout issues where things are in weird places?

Character 1: Everything's overlapping and the buttons don't work!

Character 2: Yikes, okay so that sounds like a pretty serious rendering issue. Let me just, err, pull up our compatibility matrix here... What version of the browser are you running? Because sometimes, I mean, older versions can really struggle with modern CSS grid layouts and stuff.

Character 1: How do I check that?

Character 2: Right, so if you click on the three dots in the top right—or wait, actually, which browser is it again? Chrome has dots, Firefox has the hamburger menu thingy, and Safari is, erm, different altogether.

Character 1: It's Internet Explorer.

Character 2: Oh. Oh wow. Okay, um, that actually explains everything because—sheesh—Internet Explorer hasn't been properly supported by, like, most websites since around 2020 or so. Microsoft themselves officially retired it in 2022, which is why you're seeing all these, uh, display problems.

Character 1: But I've always used Internet Explorer!

Character 2: Yeah no, I totally get that, it's comfortable sticking with what you know, right? But the thing is, modern web standards have kind of, mmm, moved way beyond what IE can handle, so you're basically trying to view websites built for 2024 with technology from, er, maybe 2015 at best.

Character 1: So what am I supposed to do?

Character 2: Well, the good news is switching browsers is actually super straightforward these days. Microsoft Edge comes pre-installed on Windows and it's, you know, basically their replacement for IE—it'll even import all your bookmarks and passwords automatically, which is pretty neat.

Character 1: I don't want to learn something new!

Character 2: Honestly, you won't really have to learn much because Edge looks almost identical to what you're used to. The buttons are in slightly different spots but, erm, functionally it works the same way—type in the address bar, click links, all that stuff is, like, exactly the same.

Character 1: Can't you just fix your website instead?

Character 2: [pause] That's... hmm. Look, I understand the frustration, I really do, but supporting Internet Explorer at this point would be like, uh, asking Netflix to still make DVDs for people who don't want to stream, you know? It would hold back features for literally everyone else using modern browsers.

Character 1: This is ridiculous!

Character 2: [exhausted] I know it feels that way and, gosh, I wish I had a better answer for you. But here's the reality—even your banking sites and, err, government websites are dropping IE support because the security risks are just too high now. We're talking about protecting your data here, not just making things look pretty.

Character 1: Fine, how do I get this Edge thing?

Character 2: Oh good, okay so it's probably already on your computer actually! Just, um, click the Start menu and type "Edge"—it should pop right up. Want me to stay on while you try it? I can walk you through importing your bookmarks and, uh, making it feel more like home once you've got it open.
