Microsoft themselves officially retired it in 2022, which is why you're seeing all these, uh, display problems."

            "content": "Yeah no, I totally get that, it's comfortable sticking with what you know, right? But the thing is, modern web standards have kind of, mmm, moved way beyond what IE can handle, so you're basically trying to view websites built for 2024 with technology from, er, maybe 2015 at best."

Microsoft Edge comes pre-installed on Windows and it's, you know, basically their replacement for IE—it'll even import all your bookmarks and passwords automatically, which is pretty neat."

            "content": "Honestly, you won't really have to learn much because Edge looks almost identical to what you're used to. The buttons are in slightly different spots but, erm, functionally it works the same way—type in the address bar, click links, all that stuff is, like, exactly the same."

Look, I understand the frustration, I really do, but supporting Internet Explorer at this point would be like, uh, asking Netflix to still make DVDs for people who don't want to stream, you know? It would hold back features for literally everyone else using modern browsers."

But here's the reality—even your banking sites and, err, government websites are dropping IE support because the security risks are just too high now. We're talking about protecting your data here, not just making things look pretty."

I can walk you through importing your bookmarks and, uh, making it feel more like home once you've got it open."
