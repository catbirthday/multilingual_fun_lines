=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I saw you were volunteering at that Special Olympics event last weekend. How was it?

Character 2: [trailing off] Oh wow, yeah, it was... honestly one of the most incredible experiences I've had in a while. I was working the swimming events at the Natatorium and, um, seeing these athletes just give everything they had, it really puts things in perspective, you know?

Character 1: Which events were you helping with specifically?

Character 2: Mainly the 50-meter freestyle and backstroke races, but I also got to help out with, uh, some of the relay teams. There was this one athlete, Sarah, who was competing in her first state games, and she was so nervous she, like, kept asking me if her goggles looked right every two minutes.

Character 1: Did she end up doing well?

Character 2: [sigh] She got fourth place which, okay, wasn't a medal, but the way she celebrated you'd think she'd won gold. Her whole family was there with these homemade signs and, gosh, when she came out of the pool they just swarmed her with hugs and it was, mm, pretty emotional actually.

Character 1: That sounds really special. Have you done this before?

Character 2: [short pause] So this was actually my third year volunteering, but my first time at the Summer Games specifically. I usually help with the, er, Winter Games skiing events up at Perfect North Slopes, but I wanted to try something different and, honestly, the aquatics venue needed more volunteers this year.

Character 1: What made you start volunteering with them?

Character 2: [joking] Well, initially I thought I'd just get a free t-shirt and some community service hours, right? But then I met this athlete named Marcus who basically adopted me as his personal cheerleader, and now I'm, like, completely hooked on being part of this whole thing.

Character 1: [mocking] Just in it for the free t-shirt, sure.

Character 2: Okay okay, you caught me being modest. The real reason is, um, my cousin Jamie has Down syndrome and competed in Special Olympics Illinois for years, so I grew up going to her events and, I guess, it just felt natural to keep that connection going when I moved here.

Character 1: I didn't know that about your cousin. Are you two close?

Character 2: [long pause] We were... she passed away two years ago actually. But she, uh, she loved competing more than anything, especially in bowling, and I kind of feel like when I'm volunteering I'm keeping her spirit alive, if that doesn't sound too, mm, cheesy or whatever.

Character 1: That's not cheesy at all. It's beautiful, actually.

Character 2: Thanks, I mean, she would've loved seeing how big the Indiana program has gotten. They had over 2,500 athletes this year, which is just, wow, absolutely incredible, and the Unified Sports programs where people with and without disabilities compete together are really taking off too.

Character 1: What's your favorite part of volunteering?

Character 2: Honestly? It's the moments right before the races when I'm helping athletes get to their lanes and they're, like, pumping themselves up, doing their little rituals and stuff. This one guy, Tony, always does exactly three jumping jacks and then fist-bumps me twice before every race, and if we don't do it he gets, er, really stressed out.

Character 1: Would you recommend other people try volunteering?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, like, one hundred percent yes. The next big event is the Fall Classic in October at Eagle Creek Park, and they always need timers and, uh, course marshals, plus you meet the most amazing people and, honestly, it completely changes how you see what's possible.
