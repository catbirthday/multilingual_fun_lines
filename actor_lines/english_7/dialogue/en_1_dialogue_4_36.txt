=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I was thinking we should probably exchange numbers since we'll be working together on this project.

Character 2: [warm] Oh absolutely, that makes perfect sense! Let me grab my phone real quick—I've got about twelve different contact lists for different partnerships, but I'll make sure you go in my priority contacts since we'll be coordinating pretty closely over the next few months.

Character 1: Twelve contact lists? That seems like a lot to manage.

Character 2: Yeah, it's part of managing around forty-five active partnerships at any given time. Each alliance needs different levels of attention, so I segment them by project phase, revenue tier, and communication frequency—helps me stay on top of who needs what and when.

Character 1: [clearing throat] Alright, ready when you are. What's your number?

Character 2: It's 415-555-0847. That's my direct line, not the general partnership desk, so you'll actually reach me instead of getting bounced around our call center for twenty minutes like some of our vendors unfortunately do.

Character 1: Got it. Should I text you so you have mine?

Character 2: Perfect, yes please! And just so you know, I typically respond to texts within about two hours during business hours, maybe three or four if I'm in back-to-back partnership reviews, but I always get back to people the same day.

Character 1: Just sent it. Did it come through?

Character 2: Yep, got it—you're the 312 area code, right? I'm adding you to my contacts now with a note that you're on the Q4 integration project so I remember the context when you reach out.

Character 1: [angry] Wait, I think I gave you the wrong number. Let me check.

Character 2: [quickly] No worries at all, happens more than you'd think! Last week I had three different partners accidentally give me their personal numbers instead of work ones, and we had to sort it all out before our kickoff calls.

Character 1: No, actually it's right. Sorry, I confused myself for a second there.

Character 2: Totally fine, I do that all the time with my numbers. Between my work cell, my desk line, and the partnership hotline, I sometimes forget which one I'm giving out—it's like juggling three different identities depending on who's asking.

Character 1: Do you prefer calls or texts for quick questions?

Character 2: Texts are fantastic for anything under five sentences or quick confirmations. But if we're talking strategy or troubleshooting, a fifteen-minute call saves about thirty back-and-forth messages, so I'd say use your judgment based on complexity.

Character 1: [furious] My last alliance manager never responded to texts at all!

Character 2: Oh I believe it—some folks in this role treat communication like it's optional, but that drives me crazy. When you're managing partnerships worth six or seven figures annually, being responsive isn't just courtesy, it's literally the foundation of maintaining those relationships properly.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset about that.

Character 2: [cry loudly] No no no, please don't apologize, your frustration is completely valid! Look, I promise you'll have a different experience with me—I track my response times religiously and my average is under ninety minutes, because I know how critical these partnerships are to everyone involved.
