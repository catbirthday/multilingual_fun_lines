Teaching is basically signing up for less money, more stress, and people constantly telling you how to do your job—but hey, if you're looking for meaning over money, I guess there's something to be said for that."

These people will literally argue about every single assignment grade, demand detailed explanations for why their kid isn't getting an A, and then, um, suggest you're not qualified to teach because you don't do it their way."

But also, um, you find other benefits matter more, like having summers to actually decompress, or knowing your work has, I dunno, real purpose beyond quarterly earnings."

Just... make sure you've got savings first because that first year is gonna be rough financially and emotionally, but if you can survive that, mmm, you might find it's exactly what you needed."
