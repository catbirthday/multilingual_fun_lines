Plus, walking around in latex gloves all day would probably, uh, make your hands super sweaty and gross, and people might think you're planning something suspicious or medical."

The scanners are specifically calibrated for human fingerprints, so your dog's paw wouldn't even—wait, actually, fun fact, dogs do have unique nose prints that could theoretically work for identification, but that's, um, that's not what we're doing here obviously."
