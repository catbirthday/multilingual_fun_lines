=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [delighted] Hey! You're not one of Harkon's crew. How'd you get past the sentries?

Character 2: Oh geez, okay, so... those crystalline things by the ravine? I didn't exactly, um, get past them in the traditional sense. The bridge kind of gave way under me and I basically just fell right through their patrol zone.

Character 1: The bridge collapsed? When?

Character 2: Uh, maybe twenty minutes ago? Honestly though, I was hauling ass away from something way scarier than your sentries—there's this massive, I mean absolutely massive storm entity just tearing through the northern passages right now.

Character 1: A storm entity... you're talking about the Maelstrom Walker.

Character 2: Wait, that's what it's called? Yeah, the thing with the lightning eyes and those, uh, those wind tentacle things? God, you actually know about this thing?

Character 1: Know about it? I've been tracking it for three months.

Character 2: [apologetic] Oh wow, I'm sorry, that's either incredibly brave or you're completely out of your mind. That thing literally just vaporized an entire caravan—like, there's nothing left of those people.

Character 1: You saw it attack a caravan? Which route were they taking?

Character 2: [extremely happy] The old smuggler's path through Widow's Canyon! They had these gorgeous azure banners, looked super official, but I mean, I was mostly focused on not dying, you know?

Character 1: Azure banners... that was the diplomatic envoy from Solace Keep.

Character 2: Oh shit, are you serious? That's gonna be a complete disaster for the treaty negotiations next week. Like, politically speaking, this is really, really bad.

Character 1: You know about the treaty?

Character 2: Well yeah, of course I do! My whole reason for being out here is, uh, basically tied to those negotiations—I'm carrying these sealed documents from the Northern Archives that were supposed to reach them before they... you know.

Character 1: Show me these documents. Now.

Character 2: Right, so here's the thing—they're sealed with blood magic and I literally cannot open them without the proper authentication sequence. Which, I'm guessing, just died with the envoy, so we're kind of screwed there.

Character 1: [excited] Blood magic. You're carrying blood-sealed documents and you just happened to stumble into my camp?

Character 2: [belly laugh] I know, I know how this looks! But honestly, I'm just a courier who picked the absolute worst job at the worst possible time. I don't even know what's actually in these things.

Character 1: [very melancholic] A courier who knows about storm entities, recognizes blood magic, and survived Widow's Canyon.

Character 2: Alright, fine, you got me—I'm not just some courier, okay? I'm a third-class Pathfinder and these documents contain the locations of every remaining Void Gate in the territories, which means if we can't crack them open, we're all basically fucked.
