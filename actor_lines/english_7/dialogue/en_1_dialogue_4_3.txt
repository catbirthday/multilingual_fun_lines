=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Hey, I haven't seen you around the building lately.

Character 2: Oh, I've been here. Just, you know, keeping different hours lately—watching the sunrise from the roof, that sort of thing. Actually saw you leaving at 3:47 AM last Tuesday, couldn't sleep either, huh?

Character 1: [confused] I don't remember going out that night.

Character 2: Mmm, maybe it was Monday then? Time gets so... slippery when you're not sleeping properly. Anyway, I've been meaning to tell you—your cat looks really healthy through the window, that new food must be working out.

Character 1: How do you know about the new food?

Character 2: Oh! Well, I mean, the delivery guy mentioned it when I helped carry your packages up last week. Blue Buffalo, right? My grandmother used to swear by that brand, before she, uh... before everything happened with her cats.

Character 1: You carried my packages?

Character 2: Just being neighborly! They were sitting in the lobby for hours and I thought, honestly, what if someone took them? Better safe than sorry, so I just, you know, put them right inside your door—it was unlocked anyway.

Character 1: My door was unlocked?

Character 2: Huh, yeah, it happens more than you'd think actually. Sometimes the latch doesn't quite catch? I've noticed it a few times when I'm walking by, so I just... I give it a little push to make sure it's secure for you.

Character 1: A few times?

Character 2: [exhausted] Look, I know how this sounds, but I'm basically looking out for everyone on this floor, alright? Mrs. Chen in 4B, she leaves her keys in the door constantly, and that guy in 4F, he's got that stalker ex-girlfriend who keeps showing up.

Character 1: How do you know about his ex?

Character 2: Thin walls, you know? Plus she, um, she actually tried to get into your apartment once by mistake—same layout as his, one floor difference. Don't worry though, I sort of redirected her before she realized her error.

Character 1: When did this happen?

Character 2: Ooh, maybe three weeks ago? You were at that work conference in Portland, the one where you gave that presentation about, er, what was it—sustainable packaging solutions? Your LinkedIn update made it sound like it went really well.

Character 1: I need to go now.

Character 2: [clearing throat] Of course, of course, totally understand. Oh, before you go though—your mom called while you were out yesterday, she seemed worried? Might want to, you know, give her a ring back when you get a chance.

Character 1: [overly polite] Thank you for letting me know. I should really get going.

Character 2: No problem at all! And hey, if you ever need someone to water those orchids while you're gone—I know they're finicky about their schedule—just, um, just let me know. Sweet dreams tonight, hopefully better than last night's, right?
