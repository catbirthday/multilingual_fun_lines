=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you finally understand why I had to fire your entire team.

Character 2: I comprehend the financial logic perfectly. The quarterly projections made it inevitable once we factored in the automation timeline. Your decision was mathematically sound, if nothing else.

Character 1: You don't seem particularly upset about it.

Character 2: [cheerful] Why would I be? Understanding the mechanics of corporate ruthlessness doesn't require emotional investment. I saw this coming three months ago when you started avoiding eye contact during meetings.

Character 1: Three months? You knew and said nothing?

Character 2: Knowledge and action are separate entities entirely. I understood your strategy, watched you plant seeds of doubt about their performance, documented every subtle manipulation. It was textbook downsizing theater.

Character 1: [smiling speaking] That's surprisingly astute. Most people miss the signs.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Well, comprehension is my specialty, not compassion. I recognized every move—the sudden interest in metrics, the consultant visits, the way you stopped learning their names. Classic distance-building before termination.

Character 1: And you just watched it happen?

Character 2: Absolutely. Watching helped me understand your methods for future reference. Every destroyed career teaches valuable lessons about power dynamics and expendability in corporate structures.

Character 1: That's a rather clinical way to view your colleagues' suffering.

Character 2: Clinical analysis yields better comprehension than emotional reactions ever could. Their suffering was predictable, quantifiable, and ultimately irrelevant to the outcome you'd already determined.

Character 1: Some might call that sociopathic.

Character 2: They might, but they'd be misunderstanding the difference between recognition and empathy. I comprehend human pain perfectly; I simply choose not to let it affect my analysis or decision-making.

Character 1: Is that why you're still here while they're gone?

Character 2: Precisely. Understanding which skills remain irreplaceable kept me valuable while they became redundant. Comprehension of corporate survival isn't about loyalty or friendship—it's about reading patterns others ignore.

Character 1: You'd throw anyone under the bus, wouldn't you?

Character 2: That phrase implies emotional decision-making, which I don't engage in. I simply comprehend cost-benefit ratios better than most, and human relationships rarely survive that calculation.

Character 1: Including ours?

Character 2: Oh, especially ours. I understand perfectly that you'll discard me the moment my comprehension skills become less valuable than my salary. That's not cynicism—it's pattern recognition based on everything you've already shown me.
