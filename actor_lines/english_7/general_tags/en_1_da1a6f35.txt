=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [freezing mid-cut] Oh my god. Sarah? Is that... is that really you standing there? I mean, after all these years, I never thought—Jesus, you're actually here.

Character 2: Tommy. Yeah, it's, um... it's me. I heard you worked here but I kept telling myself it was probably a different Thomas Martinez, you know? [nervous laugh]

Character 1: [setting down knife slowly] Seven years, Sarah. Seven goddamn years without a word, and now you just walk into my shop like you're ordering, what, hot dogs for your scout troop?

Character 2: [defensively] Actually, yes. That's exactly what I'm doing.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Right, of course. Business as usual. Look, I've got, uh, I've got packages for groups—how many kids we talking about here?

Character 2: [quietly] Twelve. Plus three adults. Listen, Tommy, I know this is, mmm, incredibly awkward, but I didn't know where else to go for quality meat on short notice.

Character 1: [working mechanically] Sure, sure. So that's, let's see... probably need about eight pounds of ground beef, couple packs of hot dogs, maybe some chicken for variety? When's the trip?

Character 2: [relieved at the practical talk] This weekend, actually. We're heading up to Pine Ridge for three nights. The kids are really excited about learning outdoor cooking skills and, um, proper food safety.

Character 1: Pine Ridge, huh? [softer] Remember when Dad used to take us up there? Before everything went to shit? Man, we must've burned through a hundred marshmallows every trip.

Character 2: Yeah, I... I actually take my troops there specifically because of those memories. It's the one place that still feels, I don't know, untouched by all the family drama. [sighs]

Character 1: [abruptly] Why'd you leave, Sarah?

Character 2: You know why, Tommy.

Character 1: [wrapping meat forcefully] Mom's drinking. Dad's gambling. The constant fighting. Yeah, I get it. But I was still here, you know? Your little brother, dealing with all that shit alone.

Character 2: I was nineteen, Tommy! I was drowning and nobody, literally nobody in that house even noticed I was struggling because everyone was so wrapped up in their own disasters. [voice cracking] I had to save myself.

Character 1: [quieter] And you did. Got your life together, became this, uhh, pillar of the community with your scout troop and everything. Good for you, seriously. Meanwhile, I learned to cut meat.

Character 2: [gently] Hey, this is a good shop, Tommy. Really good, actually. Mrs. Chen down the street raves about your ribeyes, and she's basically impossible to impress, so that's saying something.

Character 1: Yeah, well, turns out I'm pretty good with a knife. [pause] Dad died two years ago, by the way. Liver finally gave out. Mom's in assisted living now.

Character 2: [stunned] I... Jesus, Tommy, I didn't know. I mean, I heard rumors but I thought maybe people were just, um, exaggerating or mixing up stories. I'm so sorry.

Character 1: [matter-of-fact] Your order's ready. That'll be eighty-seven fifty. And Sarah? The kids'll love Pine Ridge. Take them to that clearing by the creek—best spot for stargazing, if you remember.

Character 2: Tommy, wait. I know I can't just waltz back in and fix seven years of silence, but maybe we could, I don't know, grab coffee sometime? Start somewhere? [hopeful but uncertain]
