Scenario: A rotoscope artist runs into their ex-partner, now a successful studio musician, at the coffee shop where they used to meet every morning during their relationship five years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly stunned] Oh my god, Maya? I didn't—wow, I mean, this is the last place I expected to see you after all this time, especially at seven in the morning like we used to, um, do every day.

Character 2: [wistful] Alex, hi. Yeah, I'm actually in town recording at the old studio down the street, and I just, [sighs], couldn't resist coming back here for their terrible coffee and those croissants we loved.

Character 1: Right, the croissants that were always slightly burned on the bottom but we'd eat them anyway because the morning light through that window made everything taste better somehow, or maybe that was just, you know, being together.

Character 2: [measured tone] I heard you're doing rotoscoping for that new animated series everyone's talking about, the one with all the, um, really intricate hand-drawn elements over live footage—that must be incredibly tedious work.

Character 1: Tedious, yeah, but also kind of meditative in a way, like, I spend hours tracing around people frame by frame, watching their movements over and over until I know every gesture by heart, which is, uh, ironically how I used to watch you.

Character 2: [softer] God, Alex, you can't just say things like that when I'm trying to keep this, [exhales], professional or whatever we're supposed to be now after everything that happened between us.

Character 1: Professional? We're standing in the place where you first told me you loved me, where we planned our entire future over countless cups of coffee, and you want to talk about my work like we're strangers at a networking event?

Character 2: [defensive] What else am I supposed to do? We can't exactly pick up where we left off after I basically destroyed everything by taking that touring gig when you begged me to stay. [pause]

Character 1: You didn't destroy everything, Maya, we both made choices that seemed right at the time, and honestly, seeing how successful you've become, I can't even be angry anymore, just, [sighs heavily], incredibly sad about the timing of it all.

Character 2: Success is such a weird word though, isn't it? Like, yeah, I'm playing on albums for artists I used to dream about working with, but I still wake up sometimes reaching for you and finding just empty space and session schedules instead.

Character 1: [carefully] I do the same thing, except I find reference footage and deadline reminders, which is probably why I've been rotoscoping this one scene for three weeks where the characters reunite—I keep finding reasons to make it more perfect.

Character 2: Three weeks on one scene? That's so like you, obsessing over every detail until it's exactly right, never settling for good enough even when everyone else would've called it done days ago. [fond laugh]

Character 1: [warmly] And you're still wearing that vintage Fender pick as a necklace, the one we found at that estate sale in Berkeley where the old man told us it belonged to someone who played at Woodstock, remember?

Character 2: Of course I remember, we spent our entire food budget that week on it because you insisted it would bring me luck with my music, and, [voice catching], maybe it actually did, in a roundabout way.

Character 1: I'm really glad it did, Maya, truly. Even if it meant losing you, seeing you live your dream makes all that pain feel like it meant something, you know? Like our story had purpose even if it didn't have the ending we planned.

Character 2: [trembling] Don't. Please.

Character 1: Don't what? Tell you that I still think about you every time I have to rotoscope a musician, which happens weirdly often, or that I've kept our Tuesday morning coffee slot open for five years out of some pathetic hope?

Character 2: [breaking slightly] Alex, I have to leave for soundcheck in twenty minutes and if we keep talking like this, I'm going to do something really stupid like ask you to come with me and watch me play like you used to.

Character 1: [hopeful] Would that really be so stupid though? I mean, maybe we can't go back to what we were, but we could try being something new, something that fits who we've become—unless you're seeing someone, which would make this conversation even more awkward.

Character 2: I'm not seeing anyone, haven't been able to since, well, since us, because turns out that when you've had coffee and burned croissants with your soulmate every morning for three years, everything else just tastes like compromise and disappointment. [long sigh]
