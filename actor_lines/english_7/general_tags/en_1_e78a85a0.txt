Scenario: A glass blower working late at night discovers that the mysterious customer who's been commissioning increasingly complex memorial pieces is actually the undead spirit of the town's former master artisan.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled] Master Cornelius? But you—the whole town attended your funeral three years ago, I was there when they lowered your casket into the ground.

Character 2: [wistful] Yes, well, turns out being buried doesn't mean much when you've got unfinished business involving seven hundred years of glassmaking techniques that nobody bothered to learn properly before I died.

Character 1: So all those commissions, those intricate designs you've been sending through the mail slot after midnight—you've been watching me work this whole time, haven't you? [nervous laugh]

Character 2: Every piece, every pour, every failed attempt at the Venetian twist technique that you keep botching because you're heating the glass two degrees too hot and rushing the second gather.

Character 1: [defensive] Wait, two degrees?

Character 2: [patient] Two point three, actually, and you're also not preheating your pontil properly which is why you keep getting those stress fractures in the neck of your vessels.

Character 1: I thought those were from cooling too quickly—Jesus, I've been troubleshooting the wrong end of the process for months now. [exhales] Can you actually touch things, or are you just observing?

Character 2: [melancholy] Observing mostly, though I can manage small movements when I concentrate hard enough—that's how I've been leaving those sketches, one exhausting line at a time.

Character 1: [amazed] Those designs are incredible.

Character 2: They're nothing compared to what we could create if you'd let me guide you properly—there are techniques from the old country that died with my grandfather's grandfather, methods I never had time to document.

Character 1: [thoughtful] So you're offering to teach me secrets that literally no living person knows, techniques that have been lost for generations? [pause] What exactly do you want in return?

Character 2: [earnest] Just one perfect piece, something that captures everything I learned in seventy years of working glass—a legacy that proves I existed, that my knowledge mattered, before whatever's keeping me here finally lets go.

Character 1: One perfect piece. [determined] Alright.

Character 2: You'll need to completely relearn your gathering technique first, and we should start with the simplest forms—forget everything you think you know about working with heat differentials.

Character 1: [eager] When do we start? I mean, obviously you're here now, but do you have more, I don't know, corporeal energy at certain times? [chuckles] God, I can't believe I'm scheduling lessons with a ghost.

Character 2: [amused] Between midnight and dawn I'm strongest, when the veil is thinnest as they say, though that sounds ridiculously dramatic when you say it out loud. [sighs] Tuesdays are particularly good for some reason.

Character 1: Tuesdays at midnight it is then—I'll need to adjust the furnace schedule and maybe install some brighter lights since I'm guessing you don't cast shadows I can work with.

Character 2: [growing excited] Bring your grandfather's tools if you still have them, the ones in the leather roll behind your workbench—those punty rods are actually pre-war Murano steel, perfect for what I need to show you.

Character 1: [surprised] How did you even know about those? I haven't touched them since he died, figured they were too precious to risk damaging with my amateur technique. [softly] He would've loved knowing a master craftsman wanted them used.

Character 2: [gentle] Your grandfather knew my work, you know—he bought a piece from me in 1987, a blue spiral vase that probably still sits on your mother's mantel. [fond] We're all connected through the glass, the living and the dead, one continuous line of fire and breath.
