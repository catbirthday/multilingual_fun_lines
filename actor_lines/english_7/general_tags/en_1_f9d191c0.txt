Scenario: An inventory specialist must catalog their late father's belongings while their stepbrother resists selling the family home they both grew up in.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [professionally detached] Look, Marcus, I've cataloged seventeen estates this year alone, and Dad's collection needs proper documentation before probate—every baseball card, every tool in that garage, all of it.

Character 2: [bitter laugh] Right, because that's what matters now—reducing his entire life to line items on your spreadsheet while his coffee mug's still sitting by the sink.

Character 1: This isn't about what I want to do; the court requires a complete inventory within sixty days, and we're already three weeks in. [exhales] Please don't make this harder.

Character 2: [building tension] Harder? You waltz in here with your label maker and auction estimates like this house doesn't contain forty years of memories you weren't even part of.

Character 1: [defensive] I was part of this family for fifteen years, whether you acknowledge it or not, and my mother loved this house as much as your father did.

Character 2: Your mother tolerated this house because she loved him, but she never understood why he'd spend weekends restoring that bannister or [voice cracking], why he kept every drawing I ever made.

Character 1: [heated] You think I don't notice things? His workshop still smells like sawdust and WD-40, and I know exactly which drill bits he used for different woods—I paid attention too.

Character 2: [volcanic] But you're still going to sell it all! Every memory, every scratch on the floor from where we played street hockey, [shouting], all getting auctioned to strangers!

Character 1: Because that's what the will says! He split everything fifty-fifty, and neither of us can afford to buy the other out. [quieter] You think I want this?

Character 2: [seething] Then why are you so good at it? Walking through here with your clipboard like you're inventorying office supplies instead of our childhood?

Character 1: Being methodical is the only way I can get through this without completely falling apart, okay? Every item I catalog is another piece of him disappearing forever.

Character 2: [hollowly] I can't watch.

Character 1: [trembling] Yesterday I found the Father's Day card we made him together—you drew the race car, I wrote the poem—and I had to lock myself in the bathroom to cry.

Character 2: [explosive] That's in the desk drawer with the ticket stubs from when he took us to our first baseball game! [breaking] He kept everything that mattered, everything that proved we were brothers.

Character 1: [voice cracking] We are brothers, Marcus. Not by blood, but by all those Saturday mornings he made us both pancakes, all those driving lessons in the same beat-up Toyota.

Character 2: Then how can you reduce all of that to lot numbers and estimated values? How can you be so clinical about dismantling the only home I've ever known?

Character 1: [gently] Because someone has to be strong enough to do this right, to make sure his things go to people who'll treasure them, not some estate sale vultures. That's why I do this job.

Character 2: [exhausted] I found his will drafts in the filing cabinet—seven different versions where he tried to figure out how to keep us both here somehow. [sighs heavily] He never solved it.

Character 1: [carefully] What if we don't sell immediately? We could rent it out for a year, give ourselves time to figure out if one of us can somehow buy the other's share.

Character 2: [wistful] He'd probably laugh at us for taking this long to work together on something. [pause] Okay, but I'm keeping that coffee mug.
