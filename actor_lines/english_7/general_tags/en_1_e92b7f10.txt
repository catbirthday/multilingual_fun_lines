Scenario: An account executive discovers her biggest corporate client at a charity gala is actually the gigolo she hired last week to pose as her boyfriend at her ex-husband's wedding.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [frozen smile] Marcus? I didn't realize you'd be attending tonight's gala, especially not as the representative from Meridian Industries.

Character 2: Rebecca, what a pleasant surprise. Yes, I've been handling their charitable giving portfolio for the past three years now. [measured pause] Interesting to see you here in a professional capacity.

Character 1: Professional capacity is the only capacity I operate in, as I'm sure you can appreciate given our, um, recent interaction at the Fairmont last weekend.

Character 2: [quietly amused] The wedding was lovely, by the way. Your ex-husband seemed thoroughly convinced we'd been dating for months.

Character 1: Look, we need to discuss the Q3 projections for your company's advertising spend, and I'd rather not have this particular conflict of interest hanging over the negotiations. [clears throat]

Character 2: [casually] There's no conflict here, Rebecca. What I do in my personal time and what Meridian does with its marketing budget are completely separate matters.

Character 1: [lowering voice] Separate? You charged me two thousand dollars to hold my hand and tell my cousin Jennifer about our fake trip to Santorini.

Character 2: And you got exactly the service you paid for—a convincing performance that saved you from your family's prying questions. [shrugs] Now, about that digital campaign proposal your team sent over.

Character 1: [tightly controlled] The proposal outlines a twelve-million-dollar integrated strategy that will require multiple high-level meetings between us over the next six months.

Character 2: [businesslike] Perfect.

Character 1: [incredulous] Perfect? Marcus, or whatever your actual name is, you realize this means weekly video calls, quarterly presentations to the board, and me vouching for your company's commitment.

Character 2: My name really is Marcus, and yes, I understand exactly what this entails. I've been successfully managing multi-million dollar accounts while maintaining my other profession for years now.

Character 1: [resigned sigh] Fine, but we need ground rules. No mentioning the wedding, no clever innuendos during meetings, and absolutely no telling anyone at Meridian about this.

Character 2: [professionally] Agreed. Though I should mention, your CEO's wife has my other business card. We met at a gallery opening last month.

Character 1: [barely controlled panic] Sandra knows? Oh God, she's going to see us together at the quarterly review and put two and two together.

Character 2: [calmly] She's very discreet, and frankly, she's more concerned about the ROI on your proposed campaign than my evening activities. [pause] Besides, she thinks you have excellent taste.

Character 1: [deflating slightly] This is insane. I'm standing here at a charity gala discussing media buying with someone who literally pretended to be in love with me for money last week.

Character 2: I prefer to think of it as me being exceptionally good at understanding client needs, whether that's personal companionship or strategic market positioning.

Character 1: [dry laugh] Well, at least you're consistent with your sales pitch. Tomorrow, nine AM, conference room three, and please wear something that screams 'corporate executive' not 'available for hire.'

Character 2: [wry smile in voice] Don't worry, Rebecca. I save the Armani for the evening clients. For Meridian, it's strictly Brooks Brothers and spreadsheets.
