=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [stunned] Your Majesty, I... I didn't expect to be summoned here, not after, um, everything that happened between us. This is rather irregular, isn't it?

Character 2: [wistful] Irregular, yes, but then again, when have we ever been conventional, my dear? I needed to see you before tomorrow's ceremony, before I become... well, before I become someone else's wife entirely.

Character 1: You know this is dangerous for both of us, don't you? I mean, if anyone discovers I'm here, in your private chambers, they'll... oh god, they'll assume the worst. Or perhaps the truth, which might be worse still.

Character 2: [firmly] Let them assume what they will—I am still empress until dawn, and my word is law. Besides, I've paid handsomely for your, mmm, discretion tonight, haven't I? Though I suppose that's what you do now, keep secrets for coin.

Character 1: That's unfair and you know it. I didn't choose this life, Your Majesty, it chose me when you, um, when you cast me aside for your throne. What else was I supposed to do with the skills you taught me? [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [softly] Forgive me, I—

Character 1: Don't. Please don't.

Character 2: I never cast you aside lightly, you must know that. Every night I've wondered if I made the right choice, if duty truly matters more than... [sighs] more than what we had.

Character 1: [incredulous laugh] What we had?

Character 2: You mock me now, but I remember how you used to look at me, before the crown, before the politics. Do you ever think about those nights in the summer palace, when we'd steal away to the gardens and just... exist together?

Character 1: [quietly] Every day, Your Majesty. I think about it every damn day, which is probably why I'm fool enough to be here now, risking everything for one more glimpse of who we used to be.

Character 2: Then perhaps we're both fools, because I've been counting the hours until I could see you again. Tomorrow I marry Duke Wilhelm for the alliance, but tonight, just for tonight, couldn't we pretend that time stopped in those gardens?

Character 1: [pained] You're asking me to torture myself with shadows of something that can never be again. I've built walls around those memories, Your Majesty, and you're, uh, you're asking me to tear them all down for what? One night?

Character 2: [desperately] For closure, perhaps. Or for courage to face tomorrow. Or simply because I'm selfish and weak and I needed to hear you say my name again—my real name, not my title.

Character 1: Elena. [pause] God help me, Elena, you know I could never refuse you anything, even when it destroys me. That's why you really summoned me here, isn't it? Because you knew I'd come.

Character 2: [trembling] I knew you'd come because despite everything, despite the gulf between us now, we're still bound by something neither throne nor, mmm, circumstance can break. Even if we can't have forever, we can have until dawn.

Character 1: And when dawn comes, Your Majesty? When you stand before the altar and pledge yourself to him, what happens to this night, to these words we're speaking?

Character 2: They become what they must become—a beautiful secret, locked away where no one can touch them. Unless... unless you think we might find another way, some path I haven't seen?

Character 1: [resigned] There is no other way, and we both know it. Your empire needs this marriage, and I... I'm just a ghost from your past who sells affection to strangers. But yes, Elena, I'll stay until dawn.

Character 2: [voice breaking] Then come here, my darling ghost, and let's haunt each other properly one last time. Tomorrow the empress marries, but tonight... tonight Elena simply loves.
