Character 1 [pure]: 好，我现在说几个词，你重复一遍。准备好了吗？

Character 2 [pure]: [困惑] 等等，我现在是不是应该已经戴上耳机了？因为我现在听你说话清清楚楚的，这样测听力还有什么意义啊。

Character 1 [pure]: 对，把耳机戴上。开始了啊。棒球。

Character 2 [pure]: [快速地] 帮球。诶不对不对，肯定不是这个。棒球？不过说真的，帮球听着更有意思——大家互相帮助传球什么的。

Character 1 [pure]: 对了。下一个词：飞机。

Character 2 [pure]: [含糊不清] 灰鸡。这倒是能解释为什么我的航班老是延误了——可能在给鸡洗澡呢。灰鸡算接近吗？

Character 1 [pure]: 是飞机。继续啊。冰淇淋。

Character 2 [pure]: 冰淇淋！终于有个不像我在瞎编词儿的了。虽然我刚才差点听成"病期林"，那画面感还挺诗意的。

Character 1 [pure]: 不错。现在：生日。

Character 2 [pure]: 星期。我生日正好是星期四，所以虽然听错了但精神上算对，行不行？

Character 1 [pure]: 差不多。是生日。下一个：人行道。

Character 2 [pure]: 人形岛。这听着又诡异又有趣。像那种…怎么说呢…网红打卡地会搞的噱头，什么神秘岛屿造型像个人。

Character 1 [pure]: [俏皮] 你其实比大部分人表现好多了。热狗。

Character 2 [pure]: 热狗！看吧，食物相关的词我特别准。我的耳朵很有觉悟——自动过滤掉其他的，只捕捉能吃的东西。

Character 1 [pure]: 很好。牛仔。

Character 2 [pure]: 流仔。像是专门管理河流的牛仔。说真的这个点子能赚钱——景观水系管理专家什么的。

Character 1 [pure]: 挺有创意的。牙刷。

Character 2 [pure]: 芽花。反正我早上的流程也差不多是这个意思。谁需要刷牙啊，直接嚼薄荷叶不就完了。

Character 1 [pure]: 差一点儿。最后一个：游乐场。

Character 2 [pure]: 油老厂！不过想想也差不多，都是小孩子跑来跑去，偶尔还有人吐，基本上是一回事儿。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Okay, I'm going to say some words and you repeat them back. Ready?

Character 2: [困惑] Wait, am I supposed to have these headphones on already? Because right now I can hear you perfectly fine, which seems to defeat the whole purpose of testing if I'm going deaf.

Character 1: Yes, put the headphones on. Let's start. Baseball.

Character 2: [快速地] Faceball. No wait, that can't be right. Baseball? Though honestly faceball sounds way more entertaining as a sport.

Character 1: Correct. Next word: airplane.

Character 2: [含糊不清] Hairplane. Actually that would explain why my flights are always delayed—they're probably untangling the propellers. Is hairplane even close?

Character 1: It was airplane. Let's continue. Ice cream.

Character 2: Ice cream! Finally one that doesn't sound like I'm making up Dr. Seuss words. Though I did briefly consider "mice dream" which would be adorable.

Character 1: Good. Now: birthday.

Character 2: Thursday. Which is coincidentally when my actual birthday is, so I'm counting that as spiritually correct even if audiologically wrong.

Character 1: Close. It was birthday. Next: sidewalk.

Character 2: Cider block. That sounds dangerous and delicious at the same time. Like something they'd serve at a hipster bar that also does construction.

Character 1: [俏皮] You're actually doing better than most people. Hotdog.

Character 2: Hotdog! See, I excel at food-related words. My ears have their priorities straight—they filter out everything except potential meals.

Character 1: Excellent. Cowboy.

Character 2: Koiboy. Like a cowboy but for fish farming. Honestly that's a million dollar business idea right there—decorative pond wranglers.

Character 1: That was creative. Toothbrush.

Character 2: Juice rush. Which is what I call my morning routine anyway. Who needs dental hygiene when you can just gargle orange juice?

Character 1: Almost. Last one: playground.

Character 2: Greyhound! Though I suppose both involve children running in circles and occasionally someone throws up, so they're basically the same thing.
