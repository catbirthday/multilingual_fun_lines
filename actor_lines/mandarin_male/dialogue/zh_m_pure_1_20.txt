Character 1 [pure]: [shouting] 我今天弄坏了三个哨片！三个！这简直太离谱了！

Character 2 [pure]: 哎哟，是啊，那个...那个确实挺惨的。我是说，弄坏一个就够让人抓狂的了，但一天三个？那个，呃，那绝对是那种恨不得把双簧管从窗户扔出去的时候，你懂吧？

Character 1 [pure]: 而且还死贵死贵的。我真的搞不下去了。

Character 2 [pure]: 对，所以是这样——哨片基本上就是，呃，你整套装备里最难伺候的部分，而且说实话？就算是专业演奏家也老是弄坏它们，但不知道为啥没人愿意说这事儿。

Character 1 [pure]: 我们为什么要玩这种需要这些破玩意儿的乐器啊？

Character 2 [pure]: 哈，兄弟，我每天早上坐在工作台前都会问自己这个问题。但是吧，我是说，当你遇到那个完美的哨片，就是能唱歌的那种？那感觉...啊，没有任何东西能比得上那个声音，那个感觉。

Character 1 [pure]: 我的从来不唱歌。它们就是嘎嘎叫然后死掉。

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，好吧，那你泡哨片的流程是咋样的？因为吧，很多人其实泡太久了，把竹片泡得特别不稳定，然后，是啊，基本上从一开始就完蛋了。

Character 1 [pure]: 我也不知道，五分钟？十分钟？这有区别吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 哦区别大了去了——就是，呃，做得好的哨片最多泡个两三分钟，刚好让纤维变软但不会，你知道吧，泡水泡烂了。

Character 1 [pure]: 太好了，所以我还没吹一个音就已经把它们毁了。

Character 2 [pure]: [loudly] 不不不，嘿！听着，没人好好教这些东西，对吧？这都是些奇怪的内部知识，基本上就是通过，嗯，私下传授加上血泪史传下来的，你仔细想想这简直是疯了。

Character 1 [pure]: 你能不能给我做点儿防弹哨片什么的？

Character 2 [pure]: 哈，我也想啊！不过说真的，我可以通过调整心部厚度，在某些地方多留点竹片，让它们更，呃，耐用——虽然反应没那么灵敏但肯定能用更久，这可能就是，就是你现在最需要的。

Character 1 [pure]: [long pause] 我在考虑改吹单簧管。

Character 2 [pure]: 哦，是啊，单簧哨片的诱惑，我懂。但说实话？单簧管哨片有它们自己的地狱——它们可能不那么容易裂，但要找到一个真的，呃，在所有音域都音准的？那是另一种噩梦。

Character 1 [pure]: 音乐的一切都是受罪，是不是？

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，有时候，是的。但这个就是它的...我是说，要是很简单的话，每个人都能演奏得很棒，然后，就是，魔力在哪儿呢？

Character 1 [pure]: 我连接近魔力的东西都没做出来过。就是些昂贵的吱吱声。

Character 2 [pure]: [shaky voice] 嘿，那个，我做哨片做了十五年了，我还记得为我第一批哨片哭——真的哭了——因为它们太烂了。但你会坚持下去，因为，啊，最终会有什么东西开窍了，然后你会意识到所有那些痛苦其实在教你一些最重要的东西。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [shouting] I broke three reeds today! Three! This is absolutely ridiculous!

Character 2: Oh geez, yeah, that's... that's rough. I mean, breaking one is frustrating enough but three in a day? That's, uhh, that's definitely one of those throw-your-oboe-out-the-window kind of moments, you know?

Character 1: They're so expensive too. I can't keep doing this.

Character 2: Right, so here's the thing—reeds are basically, err, the most temperamental part of your whole setup, and honestly? Even professionals break them constantly, which nobody really talks about for some reason.

Character 1: Why do we even play instruments that need these stupid things?

Character 2: Ha, man, I ask myself that question literally every morning when I'm sitting at my bench. But then, I mean, when you get that perfect reed that just sings? It's like... ahh, nothing else comes close to that sound, that feeling.

Character 1: Mine never sing. They just quack and die.

Character 2: Mmm, okay so, what's your soaking routine like? Because, see, a lot of people actually over-soak them which makes the cane super unstable and then, yeah, they're basically doomed from the start.

Character 1: I don't know, five minutes? Ten? Does it even matter?

Character 2: Oh it matters hugely actually—like, err, two to three minutes max for a well-made reed, just enough to get the fibers flexible but not, you know, waterlogged.

Character 1: Great, so I've been destroying them before I even play a note.

Character 2: [loudly] No no no, hey! Look, nobody teaches this stuff properly, alright? It's all this weird insider knowledge that gets passed down through, hmm, whispers and suffering basically, which is absolutely insane when you think about it.

Character 1: Can you just make me bulletproof reeds or something?

Character 2: Hah, I wish! Though actually, I can make them more, uhh, durable by adjusting the heart thickness and leaving more cane in certain spots—they won't be as responsive but they'll definitely last longer which might be, like, exactly what you need right now.

Character 1: [long pause] I'm thinking about switching to clarinet.

Character 2: Ooh, yeah, the siren song of single reeds, I get it. But honestly? Clarinet reeds have their own special hell—they might not crack as easily but finding one that actually, err, plays in tune across all registers? That's its own nightmare.

Character 1: Everything about music is just suffering, isn't it?

Character 2: Mmm, sometimes, yeah. But see, that's kind of what makes it... I mean, if it was easy, everyone would sound amazing and then, like, where would the magic be?

Character 1: I haven't made anything close to magic. Just expensive squeaks.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Hey, um, I've been making reeds for fifteen years and I still remember crying—literally crying—over my first batch because they were so bad. But you keep going because, ahh, eventually something clicks and then you realize all that suffering was actually teaching you something essential.
