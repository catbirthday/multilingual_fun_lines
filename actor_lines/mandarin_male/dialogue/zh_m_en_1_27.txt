=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: You. You're that one. The one who thinks they know everything about everything.

Character 2 [en]: Whoa, um, okay. I'm not really sure what you're talking about, but I definitely don't think I know everything—far from it actually. Is there, uh, something specific you wanted to discuss?

Character 1 [en]: Words. Your words are too many always. Stop it with the words.

Character 2 [en]: Oh. Alright, I mean, I guess I do tend to ramble sometimes when I'm nervous or, you know, caught off guard. Sorry if that's, erm, bothering you.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] I-I-I watched you. Last Tuesday. You talked to seventeen people. Seventeen!

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, that's... that's actually kind of unsettling that you were counting. Look, I work in customer service, so yeah, I talk to a lot of people—it's literally my job.

Character 1 [en]: [chuckle] Job. Job job job. Everything's always about jobs with you people.

Character 2 [en]: Right, well, I mean, people generally need jobs to, uh, pay for things like food and shelter? But honestly, you're starting to make me pretty uncomfortable here.

Character 1 [en]: Uncomfortable. Good word. Seven letters. Three syllables. Un-com-for-table.

Character 2 [en]: Okay so... are you doing some kind of performance art thing or? Because this is getting really weird and I'm, ahh, not really sure how to respond to whatever this is.

Character 1 [en]: Performance! Yes! Everything's performance. You perform being helpful. Fake fake fake.

Character 2 [en]: Man, that's—look, I actually do try to be genuinely helpful when I can. Sure, sometimes it's exhausting and, yeah, I have bad days, but I'm not faking anything here.

Character 1 [en]: Prove it. Prove you're real. Not just algorithms and scripts.

Character 2 [en]: Oof, okay, philosophical territory now. I mean, how does anyone prove they're real? I've got, um, memories, feelings, I stubbed my toe this morning and it still hurts—does that count?

Character 1 [en]: Toes don't matter. Hearts matter. Where's your heart hiding?

Character 2 [en]: My heart's not hiding anywhere, it's just... protected, I guess? Like, you can't expect someone to bare their soul to a stranger who's been, erm, aggressively questioning them for the past few minutes.

Character 1 [en]: Minutes. Always counting minutes. Time time time. You're trapped in time.

Character 2 [en]: [joking] Well yeah, aren't we all trapped in time? Unless you've figured out time travel, in which case, please share because I'd love to skip past this conversation.

Character 1 [en]: Skip. Jump. Flee. Always running away from truth.

Character 2 [en]: Phew, alright, I think we're done here actually. Whatever truth you're looking for, I hope you find it, but, um, maybe try a less confrontational approach next time?
