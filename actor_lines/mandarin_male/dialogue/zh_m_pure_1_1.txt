Character 1 [pure]: 为什么我们说"睡得像婴儿一样"，明明婴儿每两个小时就哭醒一次？

Character 2 [pure]: 哎哟，对吧？这其实就是那种，呃，你真仔细想想就觉得完全没道理的说法。说真的，想出这句话的人肯定没带过新生儿——小baby的睡眠质量超差的，真的是。

Character 1 [pure]: 那"神魂颠倒"呢？那不就是正常站着的状态吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，对啊！这个其实特有意思，因为最早是说"头下脚上"，你知道吧，形容翻跟头或者摔倒的样子还挺形象的。但不知道怎么的，后来就变反了，现在大家都这么……倒着说了，我觉得。

Character 1 [pure]: 鱼会渴吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 哎呀，这个嘛，严格来说——咸水鱼还真有点会？它们因为渗透压的关系一直在流失水分，所以其实得喝海水，然后，呃，通过特殊的细胞把盐分过滤出去。但淡水鱼呢，它们基本上一直处于水肿状态。

Character 1 [pure]: 为什么我们不吃火鸡蛋？

Character 2 [pure]: 哦这个纯粹是经济问题，真的。火鸡要，呃，差不多7个月才开始下蛋，鸡只要5个月，而且火鸡一年才下100个蛋左右，鸡能下300个，所以商业上根本不划算。

Character 1 [pure]: 能在水下哭吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 你绝对能在水下产生眼泪！你的泪腺又不会，就是说，自动关闭什么的。但问题是——你感觉不到泪水流下来，很明显嘛，而这种感觉其实才是哭泣情绪释放的关键部分，不是吗？

Character 1 [pure]: 为什么我们有指纹？

Character 2 [pure]: [gasp softly] 哦这是我最喜欢的问题！其实它们并不是像大家想的那样用来抓握的——它们基本上就是小小的排水沟。手指湿了的时候，那些纹路能把水排走，这样你还能抓住东西，从进化角度来说真的很巧妙，说实话。

Character 1 [pure]: 植物会感到疼痛吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 诶，这个……现在其实争议特别大。植物确实会对损伤有反应——它们会释放化学物质，甚至能，呃，警告附近的植物有威胁——但没有神经系统，这算是我们理解的"疼痛"吗？我是说，这已经是哲学问题了。

Character 1 [pure]: 为什么我的梦都没有逻辑？

Character 2 [pure]: [upset] 因为你大脑基本上在睡觉时做维护工作，就是把随机的神经信号拼凑在一起！前额叶皮层——就是你的逻辑中心——几乎是离线状态，所以你的大脑就是在乱拼记忆和情绪，没有任何，呃，质量控制。其实这种混乱还挺美的，某种程度上。

Character 1 [pure]: 能睁着眼睛打喷嚏吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 呼，技术上可以，但得特别努力才行，因为这是自动反射，就像你的身体想保护眼睛不受刺激物影响。还有，不管小孩在操场上怎么说，你的眼珠不会弹出来的——这在，呃，物理上根本不可能。

Character 1 [pure]: 为什么打哈欠会传染？

Character 2 [pure]: [child-like] 哦，其实没人真的确定！最酷的理论是跟同理心有关——就是说，帮你理解别人感受的那部分大脑，也会让你模仿他们的哈欠。光是想到打哈欠都能触发，这个……你现在是不是已经在打哈欠了？


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Why do we say "sleep like a baby" when babies wake up crying every two hours?

Character 2: Oh gosh, right? That's actually one of those phrases that makes zero sense when you, uh, really think about it. Like, whoever came up with that clearly never had a newborn—babies are terrible sleepers, honestly.

Character 1: What about "head over heels"? Isn't that just standing normally?

Character 2: Mmm, yeah! See, that one's fascinating because it used to be "heels over head" which, you know, actually makes sense for tumbling or falling. But somewhere along the way it got flipped and now we're all just... saying it backwards, I suppose.

Character 1: Do fish get thirsty?

Character 2: Oof, okay so technically—well, saltwater fish kind of do? They're constantly losing water through osmosis, so they actually have to drink seawater and then, um, filter out the salt through special cells. Freshwater fish though, they're basically waterlogged all the time.

Character 1: Why don't we eat turkey eggs?

Character 2: Oh man, that's purely economics, really. Turkeys take like, erhm, seven months to start laying eggs versus chickens at five months, and they only lay maybe a hundred eggs a year compared to a chicken's three hundred, so it's just not worth it commercially.

Character 1: Can you cry underwater?

Character 2: You can produce tears underwater, absolutely! Your tear ducts don't just, like, shut off or anything. But here's the thing—you wouldn't feel them running down your face, obviously, which is kind of the whole emotional release part of crying, isn't it?

Character 1: Why do we have fingerprints?

Character 2: [gasp softly] Oh this is my favorite one! So they're not actually for gripping like everyone thinks—they're basically tiny drainage channels for moisture. When your fingers get wet, the ridges channel water away so you can still grab things, which is pretty genius evolution-wise, honestly.

Character 1: Do plants feel pain?

Character 2: Eesh, that's... that's actually super controversial right now. Plants definitely respond to damage—they release chemicals, they can even, um, warn nearby plants about threats—but without a nervous system, is it really "pain" the way we understand it? I mean, it's kind of a philosophical question at that point.

Character 1: Why don't my dreams make any sense?

Character 2: [upset] Because your brain's basically doing maintenance while you sleep, just throwing random neural firings together! The prefrontal cortex—that's your logic center—it's practically offline, so your brain's just mashing up memories and emotions without any, uh, quality control. It's actually kind of beautiful in a chaotic way.

Character 1: Can you sneeze with your eyes open?

Character 2: Phew, yeah you technically can, but it takes serious effort because it's an automatic reflex, like your body's trying to protect your eyes from whatever made you sneeze. And no, despite what kids say on playgrounds, your eyeballs won't pop out if you manage it—that's just, er, physically impossible.

Character 1: Why is yawning contagious?

Character 2: [child-like] Ooh, nobody really knows for sure! The coolest theory is that it's about empathy—like, the same parts of your brain that help you understand other people's feelings also make you copy their yawns. Even thinking about yawning can trigger it, which... you're probably yawning right now, aren't you?
