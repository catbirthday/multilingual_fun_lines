Character 1 [mix]: 嘿，我需要你帮忙看看我的笔记本电脑，it's making this weird clicking sound.

Character 2 [mix]: [frustrated] 天啊，好吧，咔哒声是吧—等等，是咔哒咔哒咔哒那种，还是那个，呃，你懂的，就像—额，等一下，是从硬盘那边传出来的，还是从风扇那边，because that's actually really important for figuring out what's going wrong here.

Character 1 [mix]: 我觉得是从左边？就是插东西的地方附近。

Character 2 [mix]: 嗯，左边，左边...好吧那可能是—其实不对，等等，你说的是你看着它的时候的左边，还是背对着你的时候，因为这完全是两回事，还有，呃，does it happen all the time or just when you're doing specific things?

Character 1 [mix]: [yawn] 抱歉，今天太累了。一开机就一直在咔哒咔哒。

Character 2 [mix]: 啊，一直响，对对对，那肯定不是—我是说，可能是风扇碰到什么东西了，或者，呃，硬盘快挂了，which is basically the worst case scenario，但先别，呃，急着下结论，因为有时候就是里面的线松了而已。

Character 1 [mix]: [belly laugh] 你应该听听你现在说话的样子，你还好吗？

Character 2 [mix]: 哈，是啊我—不好意思，我今天喝了大概17杯咖啡，my brain is just, whoosh, you know? 反正，呃，说回你的笔记本，这是什么时候开始的，是摔了一下之后还是就突然有一天，它决定变成一个打击乐器？

Character 1 [mix]: [excited] 等等，17杯？That can't be healthy!

Character 2 [mix]: [sad] 是啊不，真的很不健康，我现在基本上在震动，我的手在做那种—算了，这不重要，重要的是你的笔记本，呃，probably fixable if we can figure out what's actually making the noise，所以你能不能录个音给我听听？

Character 1 [mix]: 当然，我去拿手机。要录多久？

Character 2 [mix]: 哦，就，我不知道，10秒？15秒？其实等等，不，录30秒吧，because sometimes these things are intermittent，我们可能会错过—你懂的，就一直录到它响几次就行，that should be enough for me to diagnose or whatever.

Character 1 [mix]: [cheerful] 好的！来，我现在放给你听。

Character 2 [mix]: [friendly] 完美，让我听听—我的天，对，这绝对不正常，这就像，死亡的咔哒声那种感觉，但别慌！我是说，your data is probably fine，我们只需要，呃，立刻备份，before the whole thing decides to give up entirely.

Character 1 [mix]: 死亡的咔哒声？听起来太吓人了。

Character 2 [mix]: [shaky voice] 不好意思，那个—我不该说死亡咔哒声，太夸张了，更像是，呃，在呼救？不等等，那也很奇怪，basically your hard drive is failing，但如果我们小心一点，应该能把所有东西都弄出来，不要，呃，给它太大压力。

Character 1 [mix]: 我怎么不给笔记本电脑压力？

Character 2 [mix]: 就是说，你基本上要避免让它工作太辛苦，所以不要同时开17个程序，或者，呃，不要移动超大的文件，just gently coax it into giving you what you need，有点像对付发脾气的小孩，except it's made of metal and plastic.

Character 1 [mix]: 你这样说真的让人没什么信心。

Character 2 [mix]: 哈，是啊，我—听着，我现在又缺觉又咖啡因过量，but I promise I actually know what I'm doing，只是我的嘴巴动得比脑子快，呃，没办法把想法组织成连贯的句子，但说真的，你的笔记本会没事的，probably, mostly，我们只要赶快把东西备份就行。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Hey, I need help with my laptop. It's making this weird clicking sound.

Character 2: [frustrated] Oh god, okay so clicking, that's—wait, is it like a click-click-click or more of a, um, you know, like when you—errr, hold on, is it coming from the hard drive area or the, the fan part, because that's actually really important for figuring out what's going wrong here.

Character 1: I think from the left side? Near where I plug things in.

Character 2: Mmm, left side, left side... okay so that could be—well actually no, wait, are we talking about when you're looking at it or when it's, uh, facing away from you because that changes everything, and also, um, does it happen all the time or just when you're doing specific things?

Character 1: [yawn] Sorry, long day. It's constant clicking when I turn it on.

Character 2: Ah, constant, right right, so that's definitely not—I mean, it could be the fan hitting something, or maybe, errr, the hard drive is dying which is, you know, basically the worst case scenario but let's not, um, jump to conclusions yet because sometimes it's just like a cable that's gotten loose inside.

Character 1: [belly laugh] You should hear yourself right now. Are you okay?

Character 2: Hah, yeah I'm—sorry, I've had like seventeen cups of coffee today and my brain is just, whoosh, you know? Anyway, um, back to your laptop, when did this start happening, was it after you dropped it or something or just randomly one day it decided to become a percussion instrument?

Character 1: [excited] Wait, seventeen cups? That can't be healthy!

Character 2: [sad] Yeah no, it's, it's really not, I'm basically vibrating at this point and my hands are doing this thing where they—anyway, that's not important, what's important is your laptop which is, uh, probably fixable if we can figure out what's actually making the noise, so can you maybe record it for me?

Character 1: Sure, let me grab my phone. How long should I record?

Character 2: Oh, just like, I don't know, ten seconds? Fifteen? Actually wait, no, make it thirty because sometimes these things are, um, intermittent and we might miss the—you know what, just record until it makes the sound a few times, that should be enough for me to, uh, diagnose or whatever.

Character 1: [cheerful] Got it! Here, I'll play it for you now.

Character 2: [friendly] Perfect, let me just—oh man, yeah, that's definitely not normal, that's like a, a death rattle kind of situation, but don't panic! I mean, your data is probably fine, we just need to, errr, back it up immediately before the whole thing decides to, you know, give up entirely.

Character 1: Death rattle? That sounds terrifying.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Sorry, that was—I shouldn't have said death rattle, that's way too dramatic, it's more like, um, it's crying for help? No wait, that's also weird, basically your hard drive is failing but we can probably get everything off it if we're careful and don't, uh, stress it out too much.

Character 1: How do I not stress out a laptop?

Character 2: Well, you basically want to avoid making it work too hard, so like, don't open seventeen programs at once or, um, try to move huge files around, just gently coax it into giving you what you need, kind of like dealing with a cranky toddler except it's made of metal and plastic.

Character 1: You're really not inspiring confidence here.

Character 2: Hah, yeah, I'm—look, I'm sleep deprived and overcaffeinated but I promise I actually know what I'm doing, it's just my mouth is moving faster than my brain can, errr, organize thoughts into coherent sentences, but seriously, your laptop will be fine, probably, mostly, we just need to be quick about backing things up.
