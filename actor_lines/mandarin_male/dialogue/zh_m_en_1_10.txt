Character 1 [en]: So what's the deal with the new update everyone's complaining about?

Character 2 [en]: They basically redesigned the entire interface from scratch. The functionality is technically better but people hate change, so there's been this massive backlash in the forums.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] Well I actually like it. The old one was getting stale.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I know you're trying to be positive but they removed the feature I spent three years perfecting. All that work just gone without any warning or explanation.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, which feature?

Character 2 [en]: [upset] The custom tagging system that let you organize everything by project and priority level. Now we're stuck with their generic categories that don't match anyone's actual workflow.

Character 1 [en]: That does sound annoying.

Character 2 [en]: [trailing off] It's more than annoying, it's completely disrupted how I manage my entire day and I don't know if I can...

Character 1 [en]: Can't you just use a workaround?

Character 2 [en]: I've tried five different workarounds already. Nothing replicates what we had before because the underlying architecture changed completely. It's like trying to fit square pegs in round holes.

Character 1 [en]: [sniffle] Sorry, didn't mean to minimize it.

Character 2 [en]: No, you're fine. I'm being dramatic about it. There are bigger problems in the world than software updates ruining my organizational system.

Character 1 [en]: Still matters if it affects your work though.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] True, and honestly it's affecting more than just work. This was the one thing I had perfectly under control and now even that's fallen apart.

Character 1 [en]: Have you contacted support about it?

Character 2 [en]: Three times this week. They keep sending the same canned response about how the new system is "more intuitive" once you get used to it.

Character 1 [en]: Classic support response.

Character 2 [en]: Right? The worst part is they're probably getting hundreds of complaints but won't admit they made a mistake. Corporate pride over user experience every single time.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Hey, want me to help you figure out a better workaround?

Character 2 [en]: That would actually be amazing. Fresh eyes might spot something I'm missing, and honestly I could use the help before I lose my mind completely.
