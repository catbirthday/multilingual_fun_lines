Character 1 [pure]: 今天大概会有多少家庭过来？

Character 2 [pure]: 哦，让我看看，呃，登记表在这儿...看起来有73个报了名，但说实话吧，通常还会有20来个临时过来的，特别是天气变冷了，你懂的吧？

Character 1 [pure]: [哭着说] 我刚...刚看到陈阿姨在外面。这次她把孩子们也带来了。

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，我...嗯，我也注意到他们了。第四站还需要，呃，再准备12个袋子—不好意思，我在记数—但是吧，看到小朋友总是感觉特别不一样，是不是？

Character 1 [pure]: 我要不要去后面多拿点适合小孩的东西？

Character 2 [pure]: 当然了，那太好了。我们需要，嗯，让我算算...35盒果汁，然后大概，就是，如果还有的话，40袋那种苹果泥？

Character 1 [pure]: [非常忧郁] 这比我想象的要难受多了。

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，是啊，第一周总是最难熬的。但是呢，第六桌需要8个志愿者—哦等等，不对，现在是7个了—说真的？这里每一个人都在做特别大的贡献，即使，呃，感觉不出来的时候也是。

Character 1 [pure]: 火鸡够分给大家吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 这个嘛，我们有92只冷冻的，其实，呃，还挺不错的？虽然可能需要补充一些鸡肉给那些，你知道，需要更多蛋白质的大家庭。

Character 1 [pure]: Johnson一家刚开车过来了。就是开那辆大面包车的。

Character 2 [pure]: 哦，来得正好！你能帮他们装车吗？他们通常要帮，嗯，大概15户来不了的家庭带东西—主要是他们公寓楼里的老人家。

Character 1 [pure]: [微笑着说] Rodriguez先生刚捐了50磅大米！

Character 2 [pure]: 哇，太棒了！这能供应，让我想想...大概60个家庭没问题，要是跟昨天收到的豆子一起，呃，合理分配的话，可能更多。

Character 1 [pure]: [极其高兴] 而且他的餐馆还要送做好的饭菜过来呢！

Character 2 [pure]: 等等，真的吗？这...哇，好吧，这就完全不一样了，因为我们可以调配大概，呃，25个志愿者去负责分发，不用准备食物了，这意味着我们能更快地服务到每个人。

Character 1 [pure]: 你在这儿协调多久了？

Character 2 [pure]: 快4年了吧，说实话？第一个月才18个家庭，现在呢，我们已经，那个，固定的就快有300家了，是有点让人应接不暇，但同时，我是说，也特别让人感到谦卑。

Character 1 [pure]: [叹气] 我真希望不需要这样的地方。

Character 2 [pure]: 是啊，我也是，当然了。但在那一天到来之前，我们有，嗯，247个邻居今天指望着我们，所以...反正吧，让我们确保每一个人都能带着他们需要的东西回家，对吧？


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: How many families are we expecting today?

Character 2: Oh, let me check the, uh, the signup sheet here... looks like we've got seventy-three registered, but honestly we usually get another twenty or so walk-ins, especially with the weather getting colder, you know?

Character 1: [哭着说] I just saw Mrs. Chen outside. She brought her kids this time.

Character 2: Yeah, I... mmm, I noticed them too. Station four needs, err, twelve more bags prepped—sorry, just keeping track—but yeah, seeing the little ones always hits different, doesn't it?

Character 1: Should I grab more of the kid-friendly stuff from the back?

Character 2: Absolutely, that'd be great actually. We need, um, let's see... thirty-five juice boxes and probably, like, forty of those applesauce pouches if we still have them?

Character 1: [非常忧郁] This is harder than I thought it would be.

Character 2: Hmm, yeah, your first week is always rough. But hey, table six needs eight volunteers—oh wait, no, seven now—and honestly? Every single person here makes such a massive difference, even when it doesn't, uhh, feel like it.

Character 1: Do we have enough turkeys for everyone?

Character 2: Well, we've got ninety-two frozen ones, which is, err, actually pretty good? Though admittedly we might need to supplement with some chickens for the, you know, the larger families who need extra protein.

Character 1: The Johnsons just pulled up. They have that big van.

Character 2: Ooh perfect timing! Can you help them with loading? They usually take boxes for, hmm, about fifteen other families who can't make it out here—mostly elderly folks from their apartment complex.

Character 1: [微笑着说] Mr. Rodriguez just donated fifty pounds of rice!

Character 2: Oh man, that's fantastic! That'll cover, let me think... probably sixty families easily, maybe more if we, uh, portion it right with the beans we got yesterday.

Character 1: [极其高兴] And his restaurant is sending prepared meals too!

Character 2: Wait, seriously? That's... wow, okay so that changes everything because we can redirect probably, ehh, twenty-five volunteers to distribution instead of food prep, which means we can actually serve everyone faster.

Character 1: How long have you been coordinating here?

Character 2: Going on four years now, and honestly? Started with just eighteen families that first month, and now we're, well, we're pushing close to three hundred regulars, which is kind of overwhelming but also, I mean, incredibly humbling.

Character 1: [叹气] I wish we didn't need places like this.

Character 2: Yeah, me too, obviously. But until that day comes, we've got, umm, two hundred and forty-seven neighbors counting on us today, so... anyway, let's make sure every single one goes home with what they need, right?
