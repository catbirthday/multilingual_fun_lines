Character 1 [pure]: [regretful] 我这周应该多练练的。钢琴几乎都没碰。

Character 2 [pure]: [apologetic] 哎呀，没事没事，真的——我是说，生活中总有各种事情嘛，对吧？重要的是你现在来了，就算你这周只有，呃，比如在堵车的时候脑子里过过曲子什么的，咱们也能从这儿开始。

Character 1 [pure]: [sleepily] 第二乐章那个过渡段我老是弹错。

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，对，那段确实谁弹都头疼。问题是这样——你左手要保持这种滚动的pattern，同时右手要进入，呃，完全不同的节奏区域，你的大脑就自然而然地想让它们同步起来。

Character 1 [pure]: 有什么窍门能弹对吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 对，所以我通常建议的是，嗯，先把它们当成两个独立的东西来练——就是说，真的把右手放在腿上，只练左手的pattern，练到，怎么说呢，基本上变成肌肉记忆。然后换过来，等两只手都练到不用想就能弹的时候，再，你懂的，试着合起来。

Character 1 [pure]: 听起来好枯燥。

Character 2 [pure]: 是啊，确实。

Character 1 [pure]: 你教了多久了？

Character 2 [pure]: 哎哟，差不多12年了吧？硕士一毕业就开始教，嗯，这一路走来还挺有意思的——从一个古典音乐死忠变成了，就是，学生想学游戏音乐我都会genuinely兴奋的人，因为说实话，有些游戏配乐真的超级复杂。

Character 1 [pure]: 你还演出吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 啊，那个，偶尔吧——主要是小场地，咖啡厅之类的。教课的schedule让巡演基本不可能，但是，呃，我现在其实更喜欢小空间的那种亲密感，你能真正地，怎么说，跟观众产生连接，而不是在台上当个遥远的身影。

Character 1 [pure]: 是什么让你选择教学而不是演奏？

Character 2 [pure]: 说实话？有个学生，大概是我教书第三年吧，她有，嗯，pretty严重的焦虑症，看着她慢慢通过音乐找到自己的声音，那种感觉就是……天啊，比我得过的任何掌声都更有成就感。那时候我就知道，这个才是，就是，我真正的calling。

Character 1 [pure]: 我有时候会想是不是年纪太大了才开始学这个。

Character 2 [pure]: 哎哎哎，别这么想——你看，我有70多岁的学生现在弹得特别棒。音乐不是什么竞赛，非要在某个年龄达到什么milestone；它更像学语言，每个人都有自己的节奏，找到自己，嗯，独特的声音。

Character 1 [pure]: 但那些神童都是5岁就开始了。

Character 2 [pure]: 对啊，但他们也错过了用成年人的理解力和情感深度来接触音乐的机会，懂吧？你带给演奏的人生阅历是任何5岁小孩都不可能有的——这不是劣势，这literally是你作为一个，呃，成年学习者的超能力。

Character 1 [pure]: [sad] 有时候我觉得自己进步这么慢是在浪费你的时间。

Character 2 [pure]: 诶，等等，绝对不是——进步本来就不是直线的，而且说真的，我最有成就感的教学时刻往往来自那些struggle的学生，因为当某个东西终于click的时候，那种感觉就是……啊，太神奇了。再说了，你对自己太严格了；从我的角度看，你其实进步得相当不错。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [regretful] I should've practiced more this week. I barely touched the piano.

Character 2: [apologetic] Oh no, hey, it's totally fine, really—I mean, life gets in the way sometimes, you know? The important thing is you're here now, and we can work with whatever time you did have, even if it was just, uh, thinking about the pieces while stuck in traffic or something.

Character 1: [sleepily] I keep messing up that transition in the second movement.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, that passage is honestly a nightmare for everyone. So here's what's happening—your left hand is basically trying to maintain this rolling pattern while your right hand shifts into, err, completely different rhythmic territory, and your brain just naturally wants them to sync up.

Character 1: Is there a trick to getting it right?

Character 2: Right, so what I usually recommend is, um, practicing them as separate entities first—like, literally put your right hand in your lap and just drill the left hand pattern until it's, I mean, basically automatic. Then switch, and only when both feel inevitable do you, you know, try combining them again.

Character 1: That sounds tedious.

Character 2: Sure, yeah.

Character 1: How long have you been teaching?

Character 2: Oh gosh, about twelve years now? Started right after my masters and, hmm, it's been quite the journey actually—went from classical snob to someone who genuinely gets excited when a student wants to learn, like, video game music because honestly, some of those scores are incredibly complex.

Character 1: Do you still perform?

Character 2: Ah, well, occasionally—mostly small venues, coffee shops, that kind of thing. The teaching schedule makes touring basically impossible but, err, I actually prefer the intimacy of smaller spaces now where you can, you know, really connect with the audience rather than being this distant figure on a stage.

Character 1: What made you choose teaching over performing?

Character 2: Honestly? There was this one student, maybe my third year teaching, who had, umm, pretty severe anxiety, and watching her gradually find her voice through music was just... man, it was more fulfilling than any standing ovation I'd ever gotten. That's when I knew this was, like, actually my calling.

Character 1: I sometimes wonder if I'm too old to be starting this.

Character 2: Oh no no no, that's—look, I have students in their seventies who are absolutely killing it. Music isn't some race where you, uh, need to hit milestones by certain ages; it's more like learning a language where every single person progresses at their own pace and finds their own, mmm, unique voice.

Character 1: But all the prodigies started when they were five.

Character 2: Sure, and they also missed out on approaching music with, like, adult comprehension and emotional depth, you know? You bring life experience to your playing that no five-year-old could possibly have—that's not a disadvantage, it's literally your superpower as a, err, mature learner.

Character 1: [sad] Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting your time with how slowly I'm progressing.

Character 2: Hey, woah, absolutely not—progress isn't always linear and, frankly, some of my most rewarding teaching moments come from students who struggle because when something finally clicks, it's just... ahh, it's magic. Plus you're way harder on yourself than you should be; from where I'm sitting, you're actually doing remarkably well.
