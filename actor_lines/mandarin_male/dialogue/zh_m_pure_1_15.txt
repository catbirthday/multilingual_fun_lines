Character 1 [pure]: [speeding up] 听我说，我知道你在想什么——又是测试，又要浪费一小时——但这次不一样。真的，我保证。

Character 2 [pure]: 怎么个不一样法？上次你保证不一样的时候，我对着一台根本没在录音的机器背了3个小时莎士比亚。我那个……尊严到现在还没从那次丢人现眼中恢复过来呢。

Character 1 [pure]: 这次我们测的是通过听觉联想来激发情感记忆。说第一个词："家"。

Character 2 [pure]: 家……你知道这个词最讽刺的是什么吗？它听起来就像是它已经不存在的东西了——就四个笔画在那儿装着还有意义，可它们描述的地方6个月前就烧没了。

Character 1 [pure]: 对不起。要是你想停下来——

Character 2 [pure]: 不用。继续吧。反正我们就是干这个的，对吧？把伤害编目，用分贝和频率来衡量损失。这样一来，一切都变得那么临床，那么好处理了。

Character 1 [pure]: [deep pitch] 那下一个词。"永远"。

Character 2 [pure]: 永远。她当时就是这么说的——永远——就在确诊之前。三周后，永远变成了72小时。语言真是个美丽的骗子，是不是？

Character 1 [pure]: [mumbling] 要不我们……"童年"。

Character 2 [pure]: 童年。我的童年在医院候诊室结束了，9岁，明白了祈祷其实没用。但你会从那儿建立起什么东西，对吧？你会构建另一种信仰。

Character 1 [pure]: 你做得很好。"笑声"。

Character 2 [pure]: 笑声……我记得她的笑——现在记不清声音了，只记得那个样子。她整张脸会先皱成一团，然后舒展成快乐。这就是我现在想重建的，一个记忆一个记忆地来。

Character 1 [pure]: 这些反应不太符合常规的——

Character 2 [pure]: 常规？悲伤哪有什么常规可言。但你学会绕着它建设，在空洞上架桥。有些日子建筑撑得住，有些日子撑不住。

Character 1 [pure]: 我们继续吗？"明天"。

Character 2 [pure]: 明天。英语里最残忍的词，因为它假定你还会在那儿迎接它。但我还是一直在做计划——这是我对宇宙仅剩的反抗了。

Character 1 [pure]: 快结束了。"原谅"。

Character 2 [pure]: [flirtatious] 原谅？你现在真是直击要害啊，医生。不过这就是我欣赏你的地方——你不装作这只是听力测试。咱俩都心知肚明我们真正在测的是什么。

Character 1 [pure]: 最后一个词。"开始"。

Character 2 [pure]: [stuttering] 开——开始。这就是——就是结局的问题所在，对吧？它们只是戴着面具的开始。每一次告别都教会你用新的方式说你好，哪怕你说的时候声音在发抖。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [speeding up] Listen, I know what you're thinking—another test, another hour wasted—but this one's different. I promise.

Character 2: Different how? Because last time you promised different, I spent three hours reciting Shakespeare to a machine that wasn't even recording. My dignity still hasn't recovered from that particular humiliation.

Character 1: This time we're testing emotional recall through auditory association. Say the first word: "home."

Character 2: Home... You know what's funny about that word? It sounds exactly like what it isn't anymore—just four letters pretending they mean something when the place they described burned down six months ago.

Character 1: I'm sorry. We can stop if—

Character 2: No. Keep going. That's what we do, right? We catalog the damage, measure the loss in decibels and frequencies. Makes it all so clinical, so manageable.

Character 1: [deep pitch] Next word then. "Forever."

Character 2: Forever. That's what she said it would be—forever—right before the diagnosis. Three weeks later, forever became seventy-two hours. Language is such a beautiful liar, isn't it?

Character 1: [mumbling] Maybe we should... "childhood."

Character 2: Childhood. Mine ended in a hospital waiting room, age nine, learning that prayers don't actually work. But you build something from that, don't you? You construct a different kind of faith.

Character 1: You're doing well. "Laughter."

Character 2: Laughter... I remember her laugh—not the sound anymore, just the shape of it. How her whole face would crumple like paper before smoothing out into joy. That's what I'm trying to rebuild now, one memory at a time.

Character 1: These responses aren't typical for—

Character 2: Typical? Nothing about grief is typical. But you learn to architect around it, build bridges over the holes. Some days the construction holds, some days it doesn't.

Character 1: Should we continue? "Tomorrow."

Character 2: Tomorrow. The cruelest word in the English language because it assumes you'll be there to meet it. But I keep making plans anyway—it's the only rebellion I have left against the universe.

Character 1: Almost done. "Forgiveness."

Character 2: [flirtatious] Forgiveness? You're really going for the throat now, aren't you, doc? That's what I like about you—you don't pretend this is just about hearing tests. We both know what we're really measuring here.

Character 1: Last word. "Beginning."

Character 2: [stuttering] B-beginning. That's the—the thing about endings, isn't it? They're just beginnings wearing masks. Every goodbye teaches you a new way to say hello, even if your voice shakes when you try.
