Character 1 [en]: Hi. I'm supposed to be meeting someone here about the position.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Oh yes, absolutely! That's me—sorry, I've been here since, uhh, five this morning dealing with inventory but I'm totally ready to chat. Why don't we, mmm, grab that table over there where it's quieter?

Character 1 [en]: Sure. That works.

Character 2 [en]: So, err, I guess I should start by saying welcome and, you know, thanks for coming in! I'm Alex, been managing this place for about three years now which is, hmm, kind of hard to believe actually.

Character 1 [en]: Nice to meet you. I'm Jordan.

Character 2 [en]: Jordan, great! Well, let me tell you a bit about what we do here—we're basically a community workspace but it's, ahh, more than just desks and Wi-Fi, you know? We really try to create this whole, like, supportive ecosystem for freelancers and small businesses.

Character 1 [en]: Sounds interesting.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah! See, the thing is, most coworking spaces are pretty sterile but we've worked really hard to make this feel more, I guess, human? Like we have plants everywhere, natural light, and everyone actually knows each other's names which is, errr, surprisingly rare these days.

Character 1 [en]: I noticed the plants.

Character 2 [en]: Right? They make such a difference! Actually, taking care of them would be part of your responsibilities if you, umm, joined us—is that something you'd be comfortable with?

Character 1 [en]: I can handle plants.

Character 2 [en]: Perfect! So basically, the role involves reception duties, some light admin work, and just, you know, being that friendly face people see when they walk in—nothing too overwhelming but definitely varied enough to keep things interesting.

Character 1 [en]: What are the hours like?

Character 2 [en]: Well, we're open seven to seven on weekdays, and, ehh, we'd need you here nine to five with an hour for lunch. Pretty standard stuff but we're flexible if you need to, like, shift things around occasionally for appointments or whatever.

Character 1 [en]: Okay. And the team?

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, you'll love them! There's just four of us right now—me, two other coordinators, and our maintenance guy Marcus who's, mmm, basically the heart of this place and knows literally everything about the building.

Character 1 [en]: How long has this position been open?

Character 2 [en]: [animated] Oh gosh, only about a week actually! Our previous person got this amazing opportunity abroad really suddenly so we're, ahh, moving pretty quickly to fill it but obviously want to find the right fit, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Makes sense.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely. So look, I mean, why don't you tell me a bit about yourself? What made you interested in working here, and, err, what kind of environment are you hoping to find?
