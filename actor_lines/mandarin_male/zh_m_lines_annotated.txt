4. [en] [surprised] Wait, you worked on the original, [curious], wireless protocols at Bell Labs?
5. [en] [defensive] Offices are outdated concepts, I mean, and anyway, um, the whole point of technology is to, [emphatic], work from anywhere, you know. [laughs]

12. [en] [quiet] You watched me.
13. [en] [hurried] Listen, um, I mean, some people can't afford the copays even with insurance and, well, I was just trying to, [desperate], help them. [exhales]
14. [en] [firm] They needed help.
15. [en] [resolute] Look, um, I know how this looks but every single patient I treated, well, [emotional], desperately needed care they couldn't get anywhere else and I documented everything in, [steady], my personal files if you'd just let me explain.
16. [en] [blunt] Well, um, maybe losing my license is worth it if, you know, I actually helped people instead of just, [bitter], pushing them through the system like products.
17. [en] [passionate] The single mother with three herniated discs who cleans offices at night couldn't, [fierce], wait six months for charity care approval while her pain got, [breaking], worse every single day. [voice cracks]
18. [en] [hurrying] Um, well, there's also the teacher with scoliosis, the mechanic with chronic neck pain, I mean, [overwhelmed], forty-seven people total who would still be suffering if I'd followed protocol and, you know, [desperate], turned them away for insufficient coverage. [sighs heavily]
19. [en] [determined] Yeah, um, every single treatment, every patient, I mean, I kept perfect records because I knew this day would, [resigned], come eventually and I'm not going to lie about, [proud], helping people who needed it.

23. [en] [curious] I mean, when I pulled away that drywall and saw, [carefully], all those colors exploding out, um, it felt like, [animated], discovering buried treasure, you know?
24. [en] [sincerely] The way light hits them through the gallery windows makes them, [delighted], glow like stained glass, and everyone who's seen them stops, [very quietly], completely mesmerized.
25. [en] [friendly] Well, I've been in construction thirty years, and, um, I've torn down, [proudly], countless walls, but this is the first time I've ever, [emotionally], given someone their life back. [sigh]
26. [en] [whispering loudly] Um, they're beautiful.
27. [en] [gentle] Well, um, maybe finding them again means you're ready to, [encouraging], paint with that same fearlessness, to trust that, [confidently], what you create matters, you know?

29. [en] The gallery owner mentioned you hadn't, [surprised], shown anything publicly in years, said you'd become, [sympathetic], almost reclusive about your work, avoiding any real, [concerned], exposure or critique.
30. [en] [moved] That's the thing about walls—they hide things but they also, [profound], preserve them for exactly the right moment. [long pause]

37. [en] She knows it's me but won't admit it because that would mean, [sad], acknowledging she was wrong about my art all those years ago. [deep pitch]
38. [en] Wait, are you saying they're actually, um, inviting me to leave something there without, [shocked], officially acknowledging it's me, like, some kind of, you know, institutional permission to be rebellious?

40. [en] [tender] How about we both stop being invisible and create something together that, [determined], forces everyone in this place to finally see what they've been missing? [laugh]
