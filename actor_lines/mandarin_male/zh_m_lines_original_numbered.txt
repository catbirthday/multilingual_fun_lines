# Speaker Lines Only (Original English) - Mandarin Chinese (Male)
============================================================

1. Oh that's, [dismissive], nice for you but public spaces are for everyone and I've got, [impatient], important calls scheduled so maybe you could find another, [curt], spot today.
2. [defensive] Look, I mean, it's not like I'm, [irritated], breaking any laws here and, um, honestly your generation had your time to, [accusatory], shape things. [scoffs]
3. Building something and understanding its potential are, [condescending], two completely different things, old timer.
4. [surprised] Wait, you worked on the original, [curious], wireless protocols at Bell Labs?
5. [defensive] Offices are outdated concepts, I mean, and anyway, um, the whole point of technology is to, [emphatic], work from anywhere, you know. [laughs]
6. [frustrated] This conversation is exactly why I don't, [exasperated], waste time explaining vision to people who can't, [dismissive], see past their own nostalgia for how things, [bitter], used to be.
7. Those quarterly projections are changing the world in ways your, [patronizing], bird-feeding never will.
8. [mocking] How poetic.
9. Actually, um, we're closing our Series A next week so, [casual], I'll probably be too busy to, well, come here anyway.
10. [cold] You know what, I was going to offer you, [hesitant], early access to our senior-focused app but clearly you're not our, [dismissive], target demographic after all.
11. [defensive] Well, um, I don't know what you mean.
12. [quiet] You watched me.
13. [hurried] Listen, um, I mean, some people can't afford the copays even with insurance and, well, I was just trying to, [desperate], help them. [exhales]
14. [firm] They needed help.
15. [resolute] Look, um, I know how this looks but every single patient I treated, well, [emotional], desperately needed care they couldn't get anywhere else and I documented everything in, [steady], my personal files if you'd just let me explain.
16. [blunt] Well, um, maybe losing my license is worth it if, you know, I actually helped people instead of just, [bitter], pushing them through the system like products.
17. [passionate] The single mother with three herniated discs who cleans offices at night couldn't, [fierce], wait six months for charity care approval while her pain got, [breaking], worse every single day. [voice cracks]
18. [hurrying] Um, well, there's also the teacher with scoliosis, the mechanic with chronic neck pain, I mean, [overwhelmed], forty-seven people total who would still be suffering if I'd followed protocol and, you know, [desperate], turned them away for insufficient coverage. [sighs heavily]
19. [determined] Yeah, um, every single treatment, every patient, I mean, I kept perfect records because I knew this day would, [resigned], come eventually and I'm not going to lie about, [proud], helping people who needed it.
20. [shocked] You're destroying evidence to protect me even though this could, [disbelief], cost you everything too if they find out you, [grateful], knew about this and helped cover it up. [crying softly]
21. [warm] Twenty-three canvases sealed behind plaster, [excited], each one signed with your name from 1998 through 2001. [chuckle]
22. Well, um, whoever sealed them in that wall, [empathetically], protected them perfectly, like they knew, [hopeful], someday you'd want them back, you know?
23. [curious] I mean, when I pulled away that drywall and saw, [carefully], all those colors exploding out, um, it felt like, [animated], discovering buried treasure, you know?
24. [sincerely] The way light hits them through the gallery windows makes them, [delighted], glow like stained glass, and everyone who's seen them stops, [very quietly], completely mesmerized.
25. [friendly] Well, I've been in construction thirty years, and, um, I've torn down, [proudly], countless walls, but this is the first time I've ever, [emotionally], given someone their life back. [sigh]
26. [whispering loudly] Um, they're beautiful.
27. [gentle] Well, um, maybe finding them again means you're ready to, [encouraging], paint with that same fearlessness, to trust that, [confidently], what you create matters, you know?
28. [thoughtful] You know, um, sometimes we bury things not to destroy them but to, [wise], preserve them until we're strong enough to, well, [optimistic], carry their weight again.
29. The gallery owner mentioned you hadn't, [surprised], shown anything publicly in years, said you'd become, [sympathetic], almost reclusive about your work, avoiding any real, [concerned], exposure or critique.
30. [moved] That's the thing about walls—they hide things but they also, [profound], preserve them for exactly the right moment. [long pause]
31. [surprised] You've been watching me this whole time and never, [anxious], said anything to security or my mother? [pause]
32. Well, you used to paint too, um, so you understand why I can't just, [bitter], hang my work through proper channels when they'd never, I mean, [frustrated], accept anything that challenges their precious status quo.
33. [defensive] She chose this sterile museum life over supporting my art when I was seventeen and needed her most, [angry], but now she gets to admire my work without, [regretful], knowing it's mine.
34. [passionate] That's exactly what art should do, um, shake people out of their, [excited], comfortable gallery stroll and make them question everything they thought they, well, [speeding up], knew about what belongs and what doesn't, you know?
35. [curious] You'd risk your job helping someone who's basically, [nervously], vandalizing your workplace with unauthorized exhibitions? [chuckle]
36. [moved] Um, nobody's ever understood why I do this, like, they all think it's about, [vulnerable], revenge or attention but you actually, er, [very quietly], see what I'm trying to say. [sniffle]
37. She knows it's me but won't admit it because that would mean, [sad], acknowledging she was wrong about my art all those years ago. [deep pitch]
38. Wait, are you saying they're actually, um, inviting me to leave something there without, [shocked], officially acknowledging it's me, like, some kind of, you know, institutional permission to be rebellious?
39. [contemplative] Maybe being invisible in a place gives you the clearest view of what's, [grateful], really happening behind all the polished surfaces and opening night champagne.
40. [tender] How about we both stop being invisible and create something together that, [determined], forces everyone in this place to finally see what they've been missing? [laugh]
