=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [警惕地] 陈部长，您的信息说很紧急，但把我从拉各斯的保护任务调回来——这可不只是紧急，是火烧眉毛了吧。

Character 2 [pure]: 绝望是我们负担不起的奢侈品，托雷斯上尉，不过我承认情况确实比我们最初预计的要糟糕。[刻意停顿] 你知道我为什么专门找你。

Character 1 [pure]: [谨慎] 因为我这人……怎么说呢，反正就是没家人可以被威胁，又会说四种普什图方言，您那些送死的任务——嗯，不就总是这三样嘛。

Character 2 [pure]: [坚定地] 因为你是唯一一个在克什米尔冲突两边都干过，还能全身而退名声不坏的特工，这让你特别适合我接下来要提的事。

Character 1 [pure]: [平淡地] 不干。

Character 2 [pure]: [更加坚持] 你还没听我开什么条件呢——三倍的酬劳，完全的外交豁免权，还有2019年摩加迪沙那事一笔勾销。

Character 1 [pure]: [苦笑] 呵，你一上来就拿摩加迪沙说事，我就知道你要我干什么了。

Character 1 [pure]: [更轻声] 谁会死？

Character 1 [pure]: [稳住呼吸] 听着，咱俩都清楚，你把我叫来不是为了保护哪个外交官的千金，也不是从敌占区撤什么暴露的线人。

Character 2 [pure]: [冷静精确] 你以前的部队，黑狼小队，叛变了——他们计划在72小时内把北约的机密防御代码卖给出价最高的人。我们需要一个了解他们规程、安全屋、弱点的人。

Character 1 [pure]: 那帮兄弟在费卢杰救过我的命，我被困在燃烧的悍马里，所有人都跑了，就他们把我拖出来的。[空洞的声音] 现在你要我去追杀他们。

Character 2 [pure]: 我要你在他们泄露从波兰到巴基斯坦所有前线基地的机密之前阻止他们——对，必要时可以使用致命武力。[停顿] 你的忠诚令人钦佩，但用错了地方。

Character 1 [pure]: [咬牙切齿] 用错地方？马库斯在阿勒颇替我挡过子弹，罗德里格斯在坎大哈掩护我们撤退时失去了一条腿，汤普森的孩子还叫我杰克叔叔呢。

Character 2 [pure]: [无动于衷] 如果汤普森完成这笔交易，他的孩子反正也会失去父亲——外国情报机构不会留活口的。

Character 1 [pure]: 你让我根据可能是错的、过时的、或者故意放出来的情报去签他们的死刑令。[重重呼气] 要是你的线人被策反了呢？

Character 2 [pure]: 情报来自罗德里格斯本人——48小时前他联系了我们，他害怕马库斯变成了什么样，但一个人阻止不了他。

Character 1 [pure]: [震惊的沉默] 罗德里格斯当了告密者？这可不像那个宁死也不背叛兄弟的人。

Character 1 [pure]: [无奈] 行吧。

Character 2 [pure]: [身体前倾] 那你接了？我需要你口头确认，上尉——这段对话正在录音，为了行动安全。

Character 2 [pure]: [最后的话] 好。三小时后军用机场有飞机，你的联络人会在路上给你具体目标和交战规则的简报。[站着] 别让我后悔选了你，托雷斯。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [警惕地] Minister Chen, your message said this was urgent, but pulling me off a protection detail in Lagos suggests it's more than urgent—it's desperate.

Character 2: Desperation is a luxury we can't afford, Captain Torres, though I'll admit the situation has deteriorated beyond our initial projections. [刻意停顿] You know why I called you specifically.

Character 1: [谨慎] Because I'm expendable, speak four dialects of Pashto, and have no family for anyone to threaten—the usual trifecta for your suicide missions.

Character 2: [坚定地] Because you're the only operative who's worked both sides of the Kashmir conflict and survived with your reputation intact, which makes you uniquely qualified for what I'm about to propose.

Character 1: [平淡地] No.

Character 2: [更加坚持] You haven't even heard the offer yet—triple your usual rate, full diplomatic immunity, and a clean slate on that Mogadishu incident from 2019.

Character 1: [苦笑] The fact that you're leading with Mogadishu tells me everything I need to know about what you're asking me to do.

Character 1: [更轻声] Who dies?

Character 1: [稳住呼吸] Look, we both know you didn't bring me here to guard some diplomat's daughter or extract a compromised asset from hostile territory.

Character 2: [冷静精确] Your former unit, the Black Wolves, has gone rogue—they're planning to sell classified NATO defense codes to the highest bidder in seventy-two hours. We need someone who knows their protocols, their safe houses, their weaknesses.

Character 1: Those men saved my life in Fallujah, pulled me out of a burning Humvee when everyone else left me for dead. [空洞的声音] And now you want me to hunt them down.

Character 2: I want you to stop them before they compromise every forward operating base from Poland to Pakistan—yes, that means lethal force if necessary. [停顿] Your loyalty is admirable, but misplaced.

Character 1: [咬牙切齿] Misplaced? Marcus took a bullet for me in Aleppo, Rodriguez lost his leg covering our retreat in Kandahar, and Thompson's kids call me Uncle Jake.

Character 2: [无动于衷] Thompson's kids will grow up without a father either way if he goes through with this sale—foreign intelligence services don't leave loose ends.

Character 1: You're asking me to sign their death warrants based on intelligence that could be wrong, outdated, or deliberately planted. [重重呼气] What if your sources are compromised?

Character 2: The intelligence comes from Rodriguez himself—he contacted us forty-eight hours ago, terrified of what Marcus has become but unable to stop him alone.

Character 1: [震惊的沉默] Rodriguez turned informant? That doesn't sound like the man who'd rather die than betray his brothers.

Character 1: [无奈] Fine.

Character 2: [身体前倾] You'll do it then? I need verbal confirmation for the record, Captain—this conversation is being documented for operational security.

Character 2: [最后的话] Good. A transport leaves in three hours from the military airfield, and your handler will brief you en route about the specific targets and rules of engagement. [站着] Don't make me regret choosing you, Torres.
