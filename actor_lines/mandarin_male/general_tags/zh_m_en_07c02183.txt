=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Maya, it's been three days since you've been home for more than just, um, a shower and change of clothes, and I'm starting to worry about you—this commission isn't worth destroying yourself over.

Character 2 [en]: I know, I know it seems obsessive but I'm so close to getting this glaze exactly right, like, the way the copper oxides are reacting with the silica is almost there, just needs maybe one more firing. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: You said that yesterday morning, and the morning before that.

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] This isn't just some hobby piece though—the museum wants thirty matching pieces for their permanent collection, and if I can't get the color consistent across all of them, they'll pull the whole contract. You understand that, right?

Character 1 [en]: [softer] Of course I understand, but what I don't understand is why you won't let me help, even just, you know, bringing you real food instead of whatever energy bars you're surviving on down here.

Character 2 [en]: Because when you're here I get distracted, okay? I start thinking about, um, us, about dinner plans, about that trip we keep postponing, instead of focusing on the chemical composition of the clay body. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Maybe that's not distraction, Maya, maybe that's, uh, actually remembering why you're doing all this in the first place—building a life, not just a career.

Character 2 [en]: That's not fair.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] I'm not trying to be fair, I'm trying to be honest with you because, well, I miss my partner, and I'm scared you're going to burn out before this project is even finished.

Character 2 [en]: God, I'm sorry.

Character 1 [en]: I don't need apologies, I just need you to, um, take a break, eat something that wasn't made in a factory, maybe sleep in our actual bed tonight instead of on that awful cot you have down here.

Character 2 [en]: [voice cracking] The thing is, every time I leave the studio I feel like I'm abandoning them—the pieces, I mean—like if I'm not watching the kiln something will go wrong and months of work will just crack apart.

Character 1 [en]: They're clay, not children, Maya. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: I know that sounds ridiculous but each one has, like, forty hours of work in it already, and the museum is expecting something extraordinary, something that justifies their investment in an unknown artist who's never done anything this scale before.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You're not unknown—you've had three gallery shows, your work is in private collections across the country, and frankly, the museum chose you because they saw something special, not because they expected perfection.

Character 2 [en]: What if I can't deliver though? What if this is the project that proves I'm just, um, a small-time potter who got lucky with a few sales? [shaky exhale]

Character 1 [en]: Then we'll figure it out together, like we always do, but I genuinely don't think that's going to happen because I've watched you create magic with mud and fire for five years now.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] You really think the glaze looks good? I mean, honestly, not just being supportive?

Character 1 [en]: It's beautiful, Maya—that deep turquoise with the copper veining is exactly what you described in your proposal, maybe even better, and I think you know that but you're too afraid to trust it. [pause] Come home tonight, please.

Character 2 [en]: [finally relenting] Okay, yeah, you're right, I'll... I'll set the kiln timer and come home, but can we maybe stop by the studio supply store on the way because I'm almost out of silica and if tomorrow's firing goes well I'll need to start the next batch immediately.
