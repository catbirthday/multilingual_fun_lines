=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: 喂，裁判，等一下——我知道你不想听这个，但你刚才判的那场比赛从一开始就很脏，and your son Marcus is wrapped up in it.

Character 2 [mix]: [measured] 我不知道你是谁，也不知道你在玩什么把戏，but you need to walk away right now before security gets involved.

Character 1 [mix]: [urgently] 你儿子欠Castellano那帮人4万块，他们逼他保证今晚的结果——Rodriguez应该在第七回合倒下，不是第三回合。

Character 2 [mix]: [stunned] 你怎么可能知道Marcus的事？他已经干净两年了，he's working at the community center，他不会——

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] 因为过去六个月一直是我在替他付每周的钱，让他们不打断他的腿，while he pretends everything's fine at Sunday dinner.

Character 2 [mix]: 这不可能，Marcus有麻烦的话一定会告诉我的，我们已经经历过这个了，when he was nineteen and I bailed him out. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] 他不想再让你失望了，尤其是你用自己的名声帮他找到那份工作之后，but now the debt's been called in full.

Character 2 [mix]: 就算你说的是真的，我判那场比赛很公正——Rodriguez三次放下防守，took two illegal hits before I stopped it.

Character 1 [mix]: [leaning closer] Rodriguez提前假摔是因为有人给他的钱比Castellano给的更多，which means your son just became collateral damage in someone else's war. [exhales]

Character 2 [mix]: [desperately] 你到底是谁？为什么帮我儿子六个月，什么都不要，without even telling me you existed until tonight? [trembling]

Character 1 [mix]: [softly] 我不是什么重要的人。

Character 2 [mix]: [pleading] 别跟我来这套——你知道我家所有的事，you've been paying blood money to keep my son alive，所以告诉我你到底是谁。[pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [reluctantly] 我以前给Castellano那帮人做账，until I found out they killed my brother over a hundred-dollar discrepancy，所以现在我帮人摆脱他们。

Character 2 [mix]: [hollow] 我的天啊，你在利用我儿子报复他们，对吧？This was never about helping him. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: 一开始，maybe，但后来我看到他每个周六都去做志愿者，how he's actually trying to be better despite everything pulling him back down.

Character 2 [mix]: [weary] 你想要什么？

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] 其实，我需要你的帮助。

Character 2 [mix]: [cautiously] 你能接触到每个拳手的医疗记录，药检，财务报表——information that could expose their whole operation if it reached the right federal investigators.

Character 1 [mix]: [steadily] 我们先把你儿子弄出来，然后把整个系统烧掉，so no other kid ends up where he is，我弟弟曾经在的地方。

Character 2 [mix]: [resolved] 我在这个运动里干净了30年，never taking a dime，从来不睁一只眼闭一只眼，and now you're asking me to risk everything. [long exhale] 什么时候开始？


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Hey, referee, wait up—I know you don't want to hear this, but that fight you just called was dirty from the opening bell, and your son Marcus is wrapped up in it.

Character 2: [measured] I don't know who you are or what game you're playing, but you need to walk away right now before security gets involved.

Character 1: [urgently] Your boy owes forty grand to the Castellano crew, and they made him guarantee tonight's outcome—Rodriguez was supposed to go down in the seventh, not the third.

Character 2: [stunned] How could you possibly know about Marcus? He's been clean for two years, he's working at the community center, he wouldn't—

Character 1: [quietly] Because I'm the one who's been covering his weekly payments for the last six months, keeping them from breaking his knees while he pretends everything's fine at Sunday dinner.

Character 2: That's impossible, Marcus would have told me if he was in trouble again, we went through this already when he was nineteen and I bailed him out. [voice cracking]

Character 1: [firmly] He didn't want to disappoint you again, especially after you put your reputation on the line to get him that job, but now the debt's been called in full.

Character 2: Even if what you're saying is true, I called that fight straight—Rodriguez dropped his guard three times and took two illegal hits before I stopped it.

Character 1: [leaning closer] Rodriguez took a dive early because someone paid him more than the Castellanos did, which means your son just became collateral damage in someone else's war. [exhales]

Character 2: [desperately] Who are you? Why would you help my son for six months without asking for anything, without even telling me you existed until tonight? [trembling]

Character 1: [softly] I'm nobody important.

Character 2: [pleading] Don't give me that—you know everything about my family, you've been paying blood money to keep my son alive, so tell me who you really are. [pause]

Character 1: [reluctantly] I used to run books for the Castellanos until I found out they killed my brother over a hundred-dollar discrepancy, so now I help people get out from under them.

Character 2: [hollow] Jesus Christ, you're using my son to get revenge on them, aren't you? This was never about helping him. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: At first, maybe, but then I saw how he volunteers with those kids every Saturday, how he's actually trying to be better despite everything pulling him back down.

Character 2: [weary] What do you want?

Character 1: [determined] Your help, actually.

Character 2: [cautiously] You have access to every fighter's medical records, drug tests, financial statements—information that could expose their whole operation if it reached the right federal investigators.

Character 1: [steadily] We get your son clear, then we burn the whole thing down so no other kid ends up where he is, where my brother was.

Character 2: [resolved] I spent thirty years keeping my nose clean in this sport, never taking a dime, never looking the other way, and now you're asking me to risk everything. [long exhale] When do we start?
