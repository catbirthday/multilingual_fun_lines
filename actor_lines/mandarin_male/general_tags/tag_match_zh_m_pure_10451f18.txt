=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [震惊] 马克？他们说要派最好的技术员过来，我...我真没想到6年没联系了，推开我工作室门的会是你。

Character 2 [pure]: [轻声] 嗯，那个...派单的时候也不会说客户名字，就给个地址和虫害类型。[呼气] 木偶工作室里有白蚁，这个我还真是头一回碰到。

Character 1 [pure]: 你看起来不错。

Character 2 [pure]: 谢谢，你也是，不过你头发里还是有木屑，跟以前一样，这让我觉得...唉，好像爸爸葬礼之后，有些东西还是没变。

Character 1 [pure]: [怅然] 这些提线木偶是爸留给我的全部了，你知道吧？每个关节都是他手把手教我刻的，现在白蚁在一点点啃食他留下的东西。

Character 2 [pure]: [温柔地] 先让我看看损坏程度，别急，好吗？有时候看着很严重的，其实发现得早，处理得当，还是能挽救的。

Character 1 [pure]: [苦笑] 呵，你什么时候变得这么乐观了？

Character 2 [pure]: 自从我明白了...就是...不是什么都要毁掉才能解决问题，[叹气]，说真的，我花了太长时间才懂这个道理，想想我这些年断了多少后路啊。

Character 1 [pure]: [更柔和] 你这是在为遗嘱宣读那天说我职业选择的话道歉呢，还是我们继续装作那次争吵没发生过？

Character 2 [pure]: [字斟句酌] 我不该说你做木偶是浪费爸爸的工具和手艺，完全不该，这些年...大概每个星期都会想起那次吵架。[停顿] 对不起，安娜。

Character 1 [pure]: [声音哽咽] 天啊，马克，我生了你这么久的气，都忘了其实...其实是想念有个哥哥在身边是什么感觉。

Character 2 [pure]: [粗鲁地] 这是干木白蚁，比地下白蚁扩散得慢，所以你的木偶...定点处理加上仔细修复，应该能救回来。[清嗓子]

Character 1 [pure]: [感激] 你在用技术话题转移注意力，跟爸爸情绪上来时一模一样，不过...谢谢你没有直接判死刑。

Character 2 [pure]: [温暖地] 还记得吗？妈妈一哭，他就开始讲木纹的事。[轻笑] 家里闹矛盾呢，突然就变成橡木和松木的区别讲座了。

Character 1 [pure]: 角落里那个，戴蓝帽子的小丑，是他确诊前雕的最后一块胡桃木。

Character 2 [pure]: 我会救下它的，安娜，我保证，就算下班后要一寸一寸手工处理，有些东西...不管怎样都值得保存。[坚定]

Character 1 [pure]: [充满希望] 等你处理完，能不能...留下来喝杯咖啡？我是说，如果你愿意的话，6年的生活，总得聊聊吧。

Character 2 [pure]: [如释重负地笑] 咖啡太好了，说不定你还能教教我这些线是怎么操作的，我一直没搞明白你是怎么让它们看起来那么...那么有生命力的。

Character 1 [pure]: [温柔地] 其实就是要接受你和更大的整体相连，你的每个动作都会影响整场演出，这个道理...我觉得对家人也一样。

Character 2 [pure]: [轻声感动] 是啊，我现在终于开始明白了，爸爸要是知道我们能在他的工作室里，在他热爱的一切中间说这些话，应该会很欣慰吧。[轻轻呼气]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [震惊] Marcus? When they said they were sending their best technician, I never imagined it would be you walking through my workshop door after six years of silence.

Character 2: [轻声] Yeah, well, dispatch doesn't exactly announce the client names when they assign jobs, just addresses and pest types. [呼气] Termites in a puppet workshop, that's definitely a first for me.

Character 1: You look good.

Character 2: Thanks, you too, though you've got sawdust in your hair like always, which honestly makes me feel like maybe not everything has changed since Dad's funeral.

Character 1: [怅然] These marionettes are all I have left of him, you know? He taught me to carve each joint by hand, and now the termites are literally eating away at his legacy.

Character 2: [温柔地] Let me take a look at the damage before we panic, alright? Sometimes what looks catastrophic is actually manageable if we catch it early enough and treat it properly.

Character 1: [苦笑] Since when are you optimistic?

Character 2: Since I learned that destroying everything in sight isn't always the answer, which took me longer than it should have, [叹气], considering how many bridges I burned along the way.

Character 1: [更柔和] Is that your way of apologizing for what you said about my career choice at the reading of the will, or are we still pretending that conversation never happened?

Character 2: [字斟句酌] I was wrong to call your puppets a waste of Dad's tools and talent, completely wrong, and I've thought about that fight probably every week since then. [停顿] I'm sorry, Anna.

Character 1: [声音哽咽] God, Marcus, I've been so angry at you for so long that I forgot what it felt like to actually miss having my brother around.

Character 2: [粗鲁地] These termites are drywood species, which means they're slower-moving than subterranean types, so your puppets might be salvageable with targeted treatment and some careful restoration work. [清嗓子]

Character 1: [感激] You're deflecting with technical talk just like Dad used to do when things got too emotional, but thank you for not just condemning everything to the trash.

Character 2: [温暖地] Remember how he'd start explaining wood grain patterns whenever Mom cried? [轻笑] We'd be having a family crisis and suddenly we're getting a lecture on oak versus pine.

Character 1: The puppet in the corner, the jester with the blue hat, that's made from the last piece of walnut he ever worked with before the diagnosis.

Character 2: I'll save it, Anna, I promise, even if I have to hand-treat every single inch myself after hours, because some things are worth preserving no matter what. [坚定]

Character 1: [充满希望] Maybe after you're done with the treatment, you could stay for coffee? I mean, we have six years of life to catch up on, if you're interested.

Character 2: [如释重负地笑] Coffee sounds perfect, and maybe you can finally teach me how these strings work, since I never understood how you made them look so alive and human.

Character 1: [温柔地] It's all about accepting that you're connected to something bigger than yourself, that every movement you make affects the whole performance, which I guess applies to families too.

Character 2: [轻声感动] Yeah, I'm starting to understand that now, finally, and I think Dad would be glad we're having this conversation in his workshop, surrounded by everything he loved. [轻轻呼气]
