Scenario: A retired engineer whose quiet park bench has become the chosen workspace for a tech startup founder who insists on conducting loud video calls there every morning.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [polite] Excuse me, young man, but I've been sitting on this, [strained], particular bench for twenty-three years every morning since my retirement.

Character 2 [en]: Oh that's, [dismissive], nice for you but public spaces are for everyone and I've got, [impatient], important calls scheduled so maybe you could find another, [curt], spot today.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, I suppose the world belongs to people like you now, doesn't it, er, with your, [bitter], important calls and your complete disregard for, umm, anyone else's peace.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, I mean, it's not like I'm, [irritated], breaking any laws here and, um, honestly your generation had your time to, [accusatory], shape things. [scoffs]

Character 1 [en]: My generation built the very technology you're, [weary], using to disrupt everything we created, though I doubt you'd, [sad], appreciate that irony. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: Building something and understanding its potential are, [condescending], two completely different things, old timer.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, I actually designed the first, [proud], wireless communication protocols at Bell Labs, but I suppose, well, that means nothing to someone who thinks, [defeated], innovation started with their, er, generation. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Wait, you worked on the original, [curious], wireless protocols at Bell Labs?

Character 1 [en]: [tired] Yes, well, I spent thirty years developing the infrastructure that, um, allows you to make those, [pointed], very important calls that, er, can't possibly wait until you're in an office.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Offices are outdated concepts, I mean, and anyway, um, the whole point of technology is to, [emphatic], work from anywhere, you know. [laughs]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Anywhere but here.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] This conversation is exactly why I don't, [exasperated], waste time explaining vision to people who can't, [dismissive], see past their own nostalgia for how things, [bitter], used to be.

Character 1 [en]: Nostalgia isn't wanting fifteen minutes of quiet to, well, feed the birds without hearing about, um, quarterly projections and, [exhausted], market disruption, er, young man.

Character 2 [en]: Those quarterly projections are changing the world in ways your, [patronizing], bird-feeding never will.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] The birds have been coming here longer than either, [melancholic], of us have existed. [trails off]

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] How poetic.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Tomorrow I'll find another bench, though I imagine you'll, [bitter], eventually claim that one too when this spot becomes, [hollow], inconvenient.

Character 2 [en]: Actually, um, we're closing our Series A next week so, [casual], I'll probably be too busy to, well, come here anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [dry] How wonderful for everyone involved, especially the birds who might finally, [sarcastic], get their breakfast in peace after your meteoric rise to wherever it is you're, [weary], rushing.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] You know what, I was going to offer you, [hesitant], early access to our senior-focused app but clearly you're not our, [dismissive], target demographic after all.
