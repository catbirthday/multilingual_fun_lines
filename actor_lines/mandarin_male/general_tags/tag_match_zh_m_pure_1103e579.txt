=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [职业语气] 那个，嗯，我看您今天是来做招牌面部护理的，我得先说一下，就是最近我们这边，呃，某些时间段的预约有点，怎么说呢，有些限制。

Character 2 [pure]: [谨慎中立] 哦，是吗。什么限制？

Character 1 [pure]: [紧张] 其实吧，我也不太方便说，但基本上就是管理层一直在，嗯，要求我们把某些预约时间留给他们所谓的"premium客户"，说白了就是... [声音渐弱]

Character 2 [pure]: [字斟句酌] 我明白了，那他们是怎么判定谁算premium客户的？是根据消费记录还是，呃，你有没有注意到其他什么标准？

Character 1 [pure]: [紧张地] 哎，我真的不该说这些，但既然您都直接问了，很明显他们在看，呃，客人的名字和住址区域来做这些决定。[声音降低]

Character 2 [pure]: 名字和住址。是这样。那比如说，从南区来的叫王晓明的客人，和从，我随便说啊，从国贸那边来的叫William Wang的，待遇就不一样？

Character 1 [pure]: [防御性地] 我是说，这规矩又不是我定的，好吗？我就是在这儿打工的，说实话，我能绕开的时候都尽量绕开了。[重重叹气]

Character 2 [pure]: [耐心地] 我不是在怪你个人，我只是想了解一下这里面到底是怎么回事，因为这个其实，呃，涉及到很严重的法律问题。[停顿]

Character 1 [pure]: [快速地] 等等，法律问题？

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯。非常严重。[小心地]

Character 1 [pure]: 天哪，我就知道这样不对，但管理层一直说这是为了，呃，"维护品牌标准"什么的，我家里还有两个孩子要养，也不能说辞就辞啊。[焦虑地]

Character 2 [pure]: 品牌标准。[干笑]

Character 1 [pure]: [轻声] 你知道吗？其实我手机里还有一些，嗯，内部邮件的截图，就是关于这个政策的，如果有用的话，因为说真的，这事儿已经让我难受好几个月了。

Character 2 [pure]: 截图会非常有帮助，而且我得说明一下，我其实不是普通客人，我是总公司的多元化主管。[温柔地]

Character 1 [pure]: [震惊] 我的天，您是... 好吧，那这就是调查对吧？我会不会有麻烦，我是说，我需要找律师什么的吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 你不会有麻烦的，事实上你现在的配合非常有价值，而且这种情况下你是受举报人保护条例保护的。

Character 1 [pure]: [松了口气] 谢天谢地。好。

Character 2 [pure]: 我就知道有问题。[叹气]

Character 1 [pure]: [坚定] 你知道吗，我现在就把那些邮件调出来，因为上周二有一整串对话，他们明确说要"discourage某些人群"，我真的，[声音颤抖]，我不能再装作什么都没发生了。

Character 2 [pure]: 我真的很感谢你的勇气，我想让你知道，我们会立即制止这种行为，而且在整个过程中你都会得到保护，好吗？


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [职业语气] So, um, I see you're here for the signature facial today, and I should probably mention that we've been having some, uhh, scheduling issues lately with certain time slots being, you know, kind of restricted.

Character 2: [谨慎中立] Oh, interesting. Restricted how?

Character 1: Well, it's not exactly my place to say, but essentially management has been, mmm, asking us to keep certain appointment times open for what they call 'premium clientele,' which basically means... [声音渐弱]

Character 2: [字斟句酌] I see, and how do they determine who qualifies as premium clientele exactly? Is it based on spending history or, uh, something else entirely that you've noticed?

Character 1: [紧张地] Look, I really shouldn't be talking about this, but since you asked directly, it's pretty obvious they're looking at, um, names and zip codes when they make these decisions. [声音降低]

Character 2: Names and zip codes. Right. So when someone like, let's say, Keisha Williams from the south side calls versus, oh I don't know, Katherine Wilson from the north shore, they get different treatment?

Character 1: [防御性地] I mean, I don't make the rules here, okay? I just work here and honestly, I've been trying to, like, work around it when I can. [重重叹气]

Character 2: [耐心地] I'm not blaming you personally, I'm just trying to understand the scope of what's happening here, because this is actually, uhh, a pretty serious legal issue. [停顿]

Character 1: [快速地] Wait, legal issue?

Character 2: Mmhmm. Very much so. [小心地]

Character 1: Oh god, I knew this was wrong but management kept saying it was just about, err, 'maintaining brand standards' or whatever that means, and I have two kids to feed so I couldn't exactly quit. [焦虑地]

Character 2: Brand standards. [干笑]

Character 1: [轻声] You know what? I actually have screenshots of some of the, um, internal emails about this policy if that would help somehow, because honestly this has been eating at me for months now.

Character 2: Screenshots would be incredibly helpful, and I should probably mention that I'm not actually just a regular client here, I'm the diversity officer for the parent company. [温柔地]

Character 1: [震惊] Oh my god, you're... okay, so this is like an investigation then? Am I in trouble here or, I mean, should I be calling a lawyer or something?

Character 2: You're not in trouble, in fact you're being incredibly helpful right now, and there are actually whistleblower protections that would apply to you in this situation.

Character 1: [松了口气] Thank god. Okay.

Character 2: I knew something was off. [叹气]

Character 1: [坚定] You know what, let me pull up those emails right now because there's actually a whole thread from last Tuesday where they explicitly say to 'discourage certain demographics' and I just, [声音颤抖], I can't keep pretending this isn't happening.

Character 2: I really appreciate your courage here, and I want you to know that we're going to make sure this stops immediately and that you're protected throughout this entire process, okay?
