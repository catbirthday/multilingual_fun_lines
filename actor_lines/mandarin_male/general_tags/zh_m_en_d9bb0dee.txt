=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So, um, I suppose you found the, [careful], documents I kept in the safe deposit box that, well, I mean, [heavy], I never intended for you to see until, [measured], you were much older.

Character 2 [en]: [shaking] The police report says they were, [bitter], murdered but you told me for twelve years it was, [accusatory], a car accident—how could you lie to my face like that, [breaking], every single day?

Character 1 [en]: Listen, er, there were things happening back then that, um, [protective], a seven-year-old couldn't possibly understand and I mean, [knowing], the people responsible were never caught so, [exhausted], I had to keep you safe. [sighs deeply]

Character 2 [en]: [furious] Safe from what exactly—the, [desperate], truth about my own parents or safe from, [trembling], whoever killed them?

Character 1 [en]: [steady] Well, um, both actually, I mean, because knowing the truth would have, [pained], made you a target too, you know?

Character 2 [en]: You had no right to, [idealistic], decide what I could or couldn't handle about my own family's death.

Character 1 [en]: I had every right because I, [firm], promised your mother I'd protect you no matter what the, [cracking], cost to myself or to our relationship when she was, [whispered], dying in my arms.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Wait, um, you were there when, I mean, [grasping], when it happened—you actually saw them, er, [horrified], die and never once mentioned, well, [barely audible], being at the scene?

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] Every single night.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] The nightmares you used to have when I was, [realizing], little—you'd wake up screaming their names and I thought, [guilty], you just missed them like I did but you were, [understanding], reliving it weren't you?

Character 1 [en]: [weary] I've carried this burden for so long that I, [relieved], almost forgot what it felt like before the weight of it.

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] Part of me wants to hate you for, [struggling], hiding this but another part sees how much it, [grasping], destroyed you to keep this secret.

Character 1 [en]: [knowing] Your mother would have been so proud of the person you've, [emotional], become despite everything.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] I need to know who killed them and, [idealistic], why—don't try to protect me anymore because I'm not, [firm], that scared seven-year-old and I deserve, [resolute], the complete truth now. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] The man who ordered their deaths is now a, [careful], senator with enough power to make people disappear without, [grave], a trace if he feels threatened by what, [quiet], we know.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Well, um, that's why you, I mean, [understanding], kept moving us every few years and er, [dawning], changed our last name twice, like, wasn't it?

Character 1 [en]: [protective] Everything I did, um, every lie I told and, well, [heavy], every truth I withheld was to give you, er, [loving], a chance at a normal life that wouldn't end, I mean, [fearful], the way theirs did.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Um, I forgive you.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] After everything I just told you about the, [grateful], lies and deception, you can just, [overwhelmed], forgive me that easily without even, [trembling], taking time to process it?

Character 2 [en]: Because, well, I finally understand that, um, [grasping], love sometimes means carrying unbearable secrets, you know, to protect the people who matter most.
