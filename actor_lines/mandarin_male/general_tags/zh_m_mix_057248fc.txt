Scenario: The prince, having renounced his title to pursue law in America, sits for his third attempt at the bar exam while the examiner discovers his true identity mid-examination.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [cautiously] 殿下——呃，我是说Aleksandar先生——这个情况很不寻常。我刚收到保安部门的通知，关于您的真实身份，now I'm not sure how to proceed with your examination.

Character 2 [mix]: [earnestly] 拜托你，就像平常一样继续吧。这是我第三次考试了，I've studied harder than ever before—constitutional law, torts, criminal procedure，全部都背熟理解了。

Character 1 [mix]: 问题是，我们有相关的规定，though frankly we've never had royalty sit for the New York bar. [nervous laugh] 您真的需要当律师吗？

Character 2 [mix]: [dreamily] 需要？不需要，但是渴望得到出身之外的东西——那就不一样了。我这辈子都是仪式和剪彩，but here, in these exam rooms, merit actually matters. [sighs]

Character 1 [mix]: 可是您已经失败两次了。大部分人第二次没过就放弃了，especially people with, well, other options like running a small European nation.

Character 2 [mix]: [brightening] 这正是我必须继续尝试的原因！每次失败都让我学到美国法律体系的新东西，about earning respect through knowledge rather than birthright.

Character 1 [mix]: [softly] 听着，我很钦佩您的决心，但您知道如果通过了，you'll actually have to work? 真实的案子，真实的客户，billable hours？

Character 2 [mix]: [laughs] 来吧，我不怕。

Character 1 [mix]: 您的大使馆之前打电话来了，apparently there's some crisis back home requiring your immediate attention，但您却在这里，参加一个您根本不需要的律师资格考试。[incredulous] 为什么？

Character 2 [mix]: [wistfully] 因为我这辈子就想完成一件事，something that can't be taken away by revolution or succession. 法律学位是我自己的，是通过我自己的努力挣来的。

Character 1 [mix]: [warming to the idea] 好吧，我能理解这个想法。但您知道这个考试是4小时的纯地狱吧？Property law, evidence rules, multi-state performance tests？

Character 2 [mix]: 4小时的地狱，在那里我只是另一个考试编号，不是王子，不是什么象征，just someone trying to prove they understand the law well enough to practice it.

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] 行，我们继续，但是没有特殊待遇。这次再失败，就到此为止了——most states have a three-attempt limit anyway.

Character 2 [mix]: 这就是我想要的——凭自己的能力成功或失败。不过我得说，I've been practicing with a study group of cab drivers who are also taking the exam.

Character 1 [mix]: 出租车司机？您一个王子，跟出租车司机一起准备律师资格考试？That's either the most ridiculous or most admirable thing I've heard.

Character 2 [mix]: [proudly] 或许两者都是吧。

Character 1 [mix]: [chuckling] 你知道吗？我觉得这次您可能真的有戏。There's something different about you compared to your last attempts.

Character 2 [mix]: [confidently] 不同之处在于，我终于不再把这看作逃避王室职责的方式，started seeing it as a path toward something meaningful.

Character 1 [mix]: 那好吧，殿下——抱歉，Aleksandar先生——我们开始吧。先考论述题，and remember, cite your cases properly this time. [pause] 祝您好运。

Character 2 [mix]: [gratefully] 谢谢您能看到我不只是头衔的一面。这比您想象的更重要，this chance to prove that dreams don't have to be practical to be worth pursuing. [deep breath] 我们开始吧。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [cautiously] Your Highness—sorry, I mean Mr. Aleksandar—this is highly irregular. I just received notification from security about your actual identity, and now I'm not sure how to proceed with your examination.

Character 2: [earnestly] Please, just continue as you were. This is my third attempt, and I've studied harder than ever before—constitutional law, torts, criminal procedure, all of it memorized and understood.

Character 1: The thing is, there are protocols for situations like this, though frankly we've never had royalty sit for the New York bar. [nervous laugh] Do you even need to practice law?

Character 2: [dreamily] Need? No, but wanting something beyond what you're born into—that's different. My whole life has been ceremonies and ribbon-cuttings, but here, in these exam rooms, merit actually matters. [sighs]

Character 1: You failed twice already though. Most people give up after the second attempt, especially people with, well, other options like running a small European nation.

Character 2: [brightening] Exactly why I have to keep trying! Every failure teaches me something new about American jurisprudence, about earning respect through knowledge rather than birthright.

Character 1: [softly] Look, I admire the determination, but you realize if you pass, you'll actually have to work? Real cases, real clients, billable hours?

Character 2: [laughs] Bring it on.

Character 1: Your embassy called earlier, apparently there's some crisis back home requiring your immediate attention, but you're here, taking a bar exam you don't need. [incredulous] Why?

Character 2: [wistfully] Because for once in my life, I want to accomplish something that can't be taken away by revolution or succession. A law degree is mine alone, earned through my own effort.

Character 1: [warming to the idea] Alright, I can respect that. But you know this exam is four hours of pure hell, right? Property law, evidence rules, multi-state performance tests?

Character 2: Four hours of hell where I'm just another test number, not a prince, not a symbol, just someone trying to prove they understand the law well enough to practice it.

Character 1: [firmly] Fine, we'll proceed, but no special treatment. You fail this one, that's it—most states have a three-attempt limit anyway.

Character 2: That's all I want—to succeed or fail on my own merit. Though I should mention, I've been practicing with a study group of cab drivers who are also taking the exam.

Character 1: Cab drivers? You, a prince, studying with cab drivers for the bar exam? That's either the most ridiculous or most admirable thing I've heard.

Character 2: [proudly] Both, perhaps.

Character 1: [chuckling] You know what? I think you might actually have what it takes this time. There's something different about you compared to your last attempts.

Character 2: [confidently] The difference is that I finally stopped seeing this as an escape from royal duty and started seeing it as a path toward something meaningful.

Character 1: Well then, Your Highness—sorry, Mr. Aleksandar—let's begin. Essay portion first, and remember, cite your cases properly this time. [pause] Good luck.

Character 2: [gratefully] Thank you for seeing me as more than just my title. This matters more than you know, this chance to prove that dreams don't have to be practical to be worth pursuing. [deep breath] Let's begin.
