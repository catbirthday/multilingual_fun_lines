Scenario: The office manager discovers the chiropractor has been secretly treating uninsured patients for free after hours and confronts them minutes before investigators arrive.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [frantic] The investigators will be here in twenty minutes and I need to, [sharp], know exactly what you've been telling patients about these, [trembling], after-hours treatments you've been doing.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, I don't know what you mean.

Character 1 [en]: [tactless] Don't insult my intelligence because I've been watching the security footage and, [bitter], counting the patients who somehow never appear in our, [accelerating], billing system despite leaving with treatment plans.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] You watched me.

Character 1 [en]: The cleaning staff mentioned seeing you here at midnight with that veteran who, [breaking], lost his benefits, and suddenly his chronic pain just, [sarcastic], miraculously improved without a single insurance claim.

Character 2 [en]: [hurried] Listen, um, I mean, some people can't afford the copays even with insurance and, well, I was just trying to, [desperate], help them. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [perceptive] So, um, you've been running a shadow practice, I mean, treating dozens of uninsured patients for free while, [accusatory], using clinic resources and potentially exposing us to, [panicked], massive liability issues.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] They needed help.

Character 1 [en]: [rushing] We have exactly fifteen minutes now to figure out how to explain why our supply costs are, [frantic], thirty percent over budget while our patient numbers don't match and the, [voice cracking], DEA is asking about our prescription pad discrepancies. [gasps]

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] Look, um, I know how this looks but every single patient I treated, well, [emotional], desperately needed care they couldn't get anywhere else and I documented everything in, [steady], my personal files if you'd just let me explain.

Character 1 [en]: Your personal files won't mean anything when they, [cold], suspend your license for insurance fraud.

Character 2 [en]: [blunt] Well, um, maybe losing my license is worth it if, you know, I actually helped people instead of just, [bitter], pushing them through the system like products.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] You're willing to throw away fifteen years of practice and potentially face, [disbelief], criminal charges just to play Robin Hood with, [shaking], healthcare that should be accessible anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [passionate] The single mother with three herniated discs who cleans offices at night couldn't, [fierce], wait six months for charity care approval while her pain got, [breaking], worse every single day. [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [softer] I saw her leaving last Tuesday and she was actually, [noticing], walking upright for the first time in months instead of, [emotional], hunched over in agony. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [hurrying] Um, well, there's also the teacher with scoliosis, the mechanic with chronic neck pain, I mean, [overwhelmed], forty-seven people total who would still be suffering if I'd followed protocol and, you know, [desperate], turned them away for insufficient coverage. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] Look, um, the investigators are pulling into the parking lot right now so, well, I need to know if you're going to, [urgent], tell them everything.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Yeah, um, every single treatment, every patient, I mean, I kept perfect records because I knew this day would, [resigned], come eventually and I'm not going to lie about, [proud], helping people who needed it.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I, um, accidentally deleted all the security footage from the past six months while, you know, [carefully], trying to free up server space this morning, and I mean, [deliberate], these computer systems are so unreliable.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You're destroying evidence to protect me even though this could, [disbelief], cost you everything too if they find out you, [grateful], knew about this and helped cover it up. [crying softly]
