=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I received a charge for $89.99 on my account. Your sales representative explicitly told me this service would be complimentary.

Customer Support [en]: I understand your concern. Let me pull up your account right away. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your service?

Customer [en]: The account email is jackson.miller@techcorp.com. I have the conversation transcript from October 15th if needed.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I've located your account, number ACC-45782-JM. I can see the $89.99 charge posted on October 28th for our Premium Support package.

Customer [en]: That's exactly the issue. During onboarding, I was promised three months of Premium Support at no charge.

Customer Support [en]: I see the notation here. You're absolutely right. There's a promotional code PSF-OCT-3M that should have been applied to waive the first three months, totaling $269.97 in value.

Customer [en]: So this was a billing error on your end. How do we correct this situation?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I'm initiating an immediate refund of $89.99 which will appear in your account within 2-3 business days, confirmation number REF-92847-TK.

Customer [en]: I appreciate that. Will the next two months also be automatically waived, or will I face this issue again?

Customer Support [en]: Excellent question. I'm applying the promotional code retroactively now. Your November and December invoices will show $0.00 for Premium Support, with regular billing resuming January 15th, 2025.

Customer [en]: Perfect. Can you send me written confirmation of these adjustments to my email address?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I'm generating a detailed confirmation now that includes your refund reference REF-92847-TK and the promotional period ending January 14th, 2025.

Customer [en]: While we're resolving this, I'd like to understand how this error occurred in the first place.

Customer Support [en]: Of course. The sales team correctly noted the promotion in your account, but the code wasn't properly linked to your billing profile during the system migration we completed October 20th.

Customer [en]: I see. What measures are in place to prevent this from happening to other customers?

Customer Support [en]: We've identified 47 affected accounts from that migration and are proactively correcting them. Additionally, we're implementing a dual-verification process for all promotional codes effective November 1st.

Customer [en]: That's reassuring. I trust this won't affect my service quality or any other account features?

Customer Support [en]: Not at all. Your Premium Support remains fully active with 24/7 access to our technical team at 1-800-555-8200, and all features continue uninterrupted.

Customer [en]: Thank you for the swift resolution. This level of accountability is exactly what I expect from your organization.

Customer Support [en]: I appreciate your professionalism and patience. You'll receive the confirmation email within 15 minutes, and I've added a $25.00 account credit as an apology for the inconvenience.
