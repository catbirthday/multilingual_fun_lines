Customer: Hi, I'm calling about my cable bill... it's gone up by—no wait, forty dollars, and I just don't understand.

Customer Support: Oh okay. Let me. Um. Pull up your account here. Can I get your account number? Or actually—sorry, phone number works too. Having a busy morning here.

Customer: Sure, it's... hmm, 555-0142. I know you're probably swamped today.

Customer Support: No worries at all! Okay so. Account 78823-CA. I see it here. Yeah your bill went from $89.99 to—er, wow—$129.99 last month. Let me. Hmm. Check what triggered that.

Customer: I'm sorry to bother you with this, I just—no, I mean, I'm on a fixed income.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely no bother! Really. So what I'm seeing is. Uh. Your promotional rate from 2023 expired. On October 15th actually. That was keeping you at the $89.99.

Customer: Oh. So that's... that's just how it is now? Forty dollars more?

Customer Support: Well. Not necessarily. Let me see what I can—hmm, what's the word—like reinstate for you. We have. Er. A senior discount program at $109.99. Would that help?

Customer: That would be... yes, that's better. You're very patient, thank you.

Customer Support: Oh gosh, of course! Let me just. Apply that now. Code SEN2024D. And actually—wait, let me also check. Hang on. There might be another one.

Customer: I know these calls must get—sorry, must be exhausting for you all day.

Customer Support: Honestly you're sweet for saying that. Okay so! Good news. Found a loyalty credit. $15.00 off. For three months. So November through January you'll be at $94.99.

Customer: Oh that's... that's wonderful. Really, I appreciate you looking.

Customer Support: Absolutely! Processing now. Confirmation number. Uh. Where is it. Oh! CRM-4558-QX. You should get an email within 24 hours.

Customer: And after January it goes to—wait no, the hundred and nine?

Customer Support: Exactly. $109.99 starting February 2025. Unless. Hmm. Actually you know what? Call back in January. Ask about the winter promotional rates. Sometimes we have—er—additional discounts then.

Customer: I'll make a note... somewhere. My grandson usually helps me with these things.

Customer Support: Smart to have help! Your new total. Effective immediately. Is $94.99. Next bill generates November 28th. Anything else I can check?

Customer: No, I think... I think we're all set. Thank you for being so helpful.

Customer Support: My pleasure! Really. Have a great rest of your day. And hey. Thanks for being so understanding. Makes my job easier.
