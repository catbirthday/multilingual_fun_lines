=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I need—wait no—I have to change my card. Before it bills. Tomorrow I think?

Customer Support [en]: Okay, let me pull up your account here... *exhales* alright, so I'm seeing your next billing date is actually December 15th, not tomorrow, which gives us, um... plenty of time to get this sorted for you.

Customer [en]: December—no that can't—I got an email. Said payment soon. Is my service gonna stop?

Customer Support [en]: Oh I see what happened, so the email you got was probably the, er... what's it called... the reminder notice we send 7 days before billing. Your account number A-5472-BK9 is totally fine, nothing's shutting off or anything.

Customer [en]: But the card—it's canceled. Got stolen. What if—what happens if—

Customer Support [en]: *sharp inhale* Right, okay, so we can absolutely update that right now. I just need to, hmm... verify a few things first. Can you give me the last four digits of the card currently on file? Should be ending in something like 4 digits.

Customer [en]: It's—wait let me—no that's the new one. Old one ends... 8923?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, yeah that matches what I have here, 8923. So for the new card, I'll need the full number, and then, uh—sorry, also the expiration date and that 3-digit security code on the back.

Customer [en]: Can't mess this up. If it declines—I can't—we need the service.

Customer Support [en]: *soft exhale* Hey, I totally get it. Look, what I can do is, er... once we add the new card, I'll run a test authorization for just $1.00 to make absolutely sure it's working before your actual billing date.

Customer [en]: Test? That's—wait how does—will that charge me?

Customer Support [en]: No no, it's not a real charge, it's more like a... hmm, how do I explain this... basically we ping your bank, they confirm the card's valid, and the dollar drops off within 24 to 48 hours. Your December bill of $127.89 will process normally on the 15th.

Customer [en]: Okay so—no wait—the number is 4455... 6789... then what?

Customer Support [en]: Alright, I need, let's see... 4455-6789 and then the remaining 8 digits whenever you're ready.

Customer [en]: 0011-2233. Expires—wait is that—yeah, 07/26.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, 07/26, and then that, uh—the CVV, that little security code?

Customer [en]: 445. This will work right? Won't bounce?

Customer Support [en]: *exhales* So I've updated everything in the system, account A-5472-BK9 now has the new card ending in 2233, and... yep, the test authorization just went through successfully. You're all set.

Customer [en]: It worked? Already? So December 15th—it'll just—automatically?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly, yeah. December 15th at 12:01 AM Pacific, it'll process your regular monthly charge of $127.89 to the new card. And actually, I'm sending you a confirmation email right now to the address on file, so you'll have all this in writing too.
