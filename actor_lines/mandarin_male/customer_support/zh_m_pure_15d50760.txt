=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [pure]: 我就是—我就是想问个事儿。*exhales* 可能没什么大不了的，但我看到新客户有五折优惠。

Customer Support [pure]: 哎，我完全理解您的心情！让我这边调出您的账户—那个...怎么查比较方便...您的手机尾号是？

Customer [pure]: 是是4-4-7-2。我跟你们都八年了。

Customer Support [pure]: 好的，太感谢了！我看到您的账户了，客户编号CST-48392-M，哇，您真的是从2016年就开始用我们的服务了！太厉害了。那个新客户优惠的事—哎不对，让我先—我明白您问的是什么了。

Customer [pure]: 是啊。*sighs* 唉，我知道会怎么样的。你们也没办法做什么。

Customer Support [pure]: 不过您知道吗？其实我—让我看看这个。因为说真的，八年啊...这种忠诚度真的很有分量。我在查一下我们的留存优惠系统，代码是RET-2024-Q4。

Customer [pure]: 对不起，我就是...打电话给各种地方都听到一样的话，太累了。新客户才重要。

Customer Support [pure]: 不不不，您千万别道歉！您这么想完全有道理。我在看—哎不是，我是说另一个界面—其实有个忠诚会员匹配计划，不是每个人都知道的。

Customer [pure]: 真的吗？还是说—这只是让我心里好受点？

Customer Support [pure]: 我向您保证这是真的！这个计划叫LMP-50-MATCH，基本上就是...怎么说呢...就是追溯性地给您接下来三个账单周期都打五折。

Customer [pure]: *inhales sharply* 等等，那—那不就是一样的优惠吗？

Customer Support [pure]: 其实更好呢！因为新客户只有第一个月有，但是以您的资历—您用了96个月的服务，是第4级会员—可以享受三个月的优惠。

Customer [pure]: 哦。嗯。我没想到...好好，那我需要做什么吗？

Customer Support [pure]: 什么都不用做！我现在就给您申请上。确认号是...让我确认一下没错...SAVE-7829-XK41。您15号的账单上就能看到了。

Customer [pure]: 我觉得—我觉得自己有点傻。白生了一肚子气。

Customer Support [pure]: 哎呀，千万别这么说！这根本不是您的问题。我们应该—哎不对，其实我们确实应该把这些优惠计划宣传得更清楚些。我在您的档案里记一下这件事。

Customer [pure]: 谢谢。真的。这个...*exhales* 您真是太好了。

Customer Support [pure]: 不客气！还有啊，我们有个推荐返利计划RFC-2024，您每推荐一个朋友就能减25块。既然您用了八年都这么满意，可以跟朋友们提一下？

Customer [pure]: 好。好，我现在肯定会推荐的。再次抱歉刚才态度不好。

Customer Support [pure]: 您一点都不难搞！这就是我的工作啊。您的新费率从12月15号的账单周期开始，我的分机号是5847，以后有什么事都可以直接找我。感谢您这些年一直选择我们！


=== Original (English) ===

Customer: I just—I just wanted to ask about something. *exhales* It's probably nothing but I saw new customers get fifty percent off.

Customer Support: Oh, I hear you completely! Let me pull up your account here—what's the... what's the best way to look this up for you... your phone number ending in?

Customer: It's it's 4-4-7-2. I've been with you guys eight years.

Customer Support: Perfect, thank you so much! I can see your account here, customer ID CST-48392-M, and wow, you really have been with us since 2016! That's amazing. So the—no wait, let me just—I see what you're asking about with the new customer promotion.

Customer: Yeah. *sighs* Look, I know how this goes. You can't do anything about it.

Customer Support: You know what though? I actually—let me look at something here. Because honestly, eight years is... that's the kind of loyalty that means something. I'm checking our retention offers in system code RET-2024-Q4.

Customer: I'm sorry, I'm just... tired of calling places and hearing the same thing. New customers matter more.

Customer Support: No no no, please don't apologize! You're absolutely right to feel that way. I'm looking at—sorry, I mean the other screen—there's actually a loyalty match program that not everyone knows about.

Customer: Really? Or is this just—is this just something to make me feel better?

Customer Support: I promise you this is real! It's program LMP-50-MATCH and basically what it does is... how do I explain this... it retroactively applies that same 50% discount to your next three billing cycles.

Customer: *inhales sharply* Wait, that's—that's actually the same deal?

Customer Support: It's actually better! Because new customers only get it for month one, but with your tenure level—you're tier 4 based on 96 months of service—you qualify for the three-month version.

Customer: Oh. Um. I didn't expect... okay okay, so what do I need to do?

Customer Support: Nothing at all! I'm applying it right now to your account. The confirmation number is... let me make sure I get this right... SAVE-7829-XK41. You'll see it on your next statement dated the 15th.

Customer: I feel—I feel kind of silly now. I came in all frustrated about nothing.

Customer Support: Oh my goodness, no! This isn't on you at all. We should be—wait, actually, we are supposed to be better about communicating these programs. I'm making a note in your file about this.

Customer: Thanks. Really. This is... *exhales* this is really nice of you.

Customer Support: You're so welcome! And just so you know, there's also a referral credit program RFC-2024 where you get $25 off for each person you refer. Since you've been so happy with us for eight years, might be worth mentioning to friends?

Customer: Yeah. Yeah, I'll I'll definitely do that now. Sorry again for being difficult.

Customer Support: You weren't difficult at all! This is exactly what I'm here for. Your new rate starts with the December 15th billing cycle, and my direct extension is 5847 if you ever need anything else. Thank you for staying with us all these years!
