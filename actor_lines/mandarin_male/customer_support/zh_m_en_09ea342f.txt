=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Good afternoon. I'm calling on behalf of my father, Robert Chen, regarding his account.

Customer Support [en]: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling. I'll be happy to assist you today. May I have the account number or the primary phone number associated with Mr. Chen's account?

Customer [en]: The account number is 447-289-3156. He asked me to inquire about the recent billing discrepancy.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I'm pulling up account 447-289-3156 now. For security purposes, I'll need to verify some information. Can you provide the last four digits of the social security number on file?

Customer [en]: Yes, that would be 8924. My father noticed a charge that doesn't match his service agreement.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, thank you for verifying. I can see Mr. Chen's account here and I'm reviewing the recent billing statement from October 15th. I do see an additional charge of $47.99 that appears to be a service fee.

Customer [en]: That's correct. According to his contract, that fee should have been waived for the first year.

Customer Support [en]: You're absolutely right. I can see in the original service agreement dated September 2nd that the activation fee should be waived for new customers during our Q4 promotion. This appears to be an error on our part.

Customer [en]: Thank you for confirming that. What steps can we take to resolve this issue today?

Customer Support [en]: I'm processing a full refund of $47.99 right now. The credit will appear on statement cycle 11-15-2024, which closes in 8 business days. Additionally, I'm adding a note to ensure this doesn't happen again.

Customer [en]: That's appreciated. Will you be sending a confirmation of this adjustment to his email address?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I'll send a detailed confirmation to the email we have on file, which ends in @techmail.com. The confirmation number for this adjustment is ADJ-7736-QZK and you should receive it within the next 30 minutes.

Customer [en]: Perfect. Could you also update the billing preferences to paperless while we have the account open?

Customer Support [en]: Of course. I'm updating the billing preferences to paperless statements now. Starting with the November cycle, all statements will be sent electronically to the registered email address on the 5th of each month.

Customer [en]: Excellent. One more thing please. Can you verify the current monthly service rate going forward?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. After this adjustment, Mr. Chen's monthly rate remains at $89.99 for the premium package, locked in for 24 months as per agreement AG-2024-1829. There are no additional fees or charges scheduled.

Customer [en]: Thank you. That matches what he has in his records. Is there anything else needed from our end?

Customer Support [en]: No, everything is complete on your end. I've documented all changes under reference ticket TK-4492-8831. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Mr. Chen's account today?

Customer [en]: No, that covers everything he asked me to handle. Thank you for your assistance and professionalism.

Customer Support [en]: You're very welcome. Thank you for calling on Mr. Chen's behalf. You've been extremely helpful in getting this resolved. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and remember you can reference ticket TK-4492-8831 if you need to follow up.
