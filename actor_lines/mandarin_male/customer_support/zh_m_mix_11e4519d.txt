Customer [mix]: Let me see here... 我被收了restocking fee？以前从来没有过这种事啊。

Customer Support [mix]: Oh okay, hmm, let me pull up your account real quick... 账号是A5527-PKL。嗯，我们确实在10月15号更新了退货政策，电子产品14天后退货现在要收restocking fee了。

Customer [mix]: October fifteenth. 没有人告诉我啊。我是说，应该要发个email什么的吧？

Customer Support [mix]: You're absolutely right about that. *exhales* 我们是发了通知，但是，呃，我查一下...看起来发到你的旧邮箱了，是hotmail结尾的。我们这边记录的是2019年的邮箱，这个确实是我们没有确认好。

Customer [mix]: Hotmail, wait no, that's—不对不对，我好几年前就换成Gmail了。

Customer Support [mix]: Right right. 嗯，我现在能做的就是更新成你现在的邮箱，而且说实话，既然这是我们沟通上的问题，我会把那个restocking fee给你免掉。交易号TXN-9981-RV显示是32块5，3到5个工作日内会退回给你。

Customer [mix]: Huh. Okay so that means... 其他政策应该也都改了吧？

Customer Support [mix]: *sharp inhale* Yeah unfortunately quite a few things shifted. 呃，主要的几个是restocking fee，免运费的最低消费从25块涨到35块了，还有延保现在要在7天内购买，不是以前的30天了。

Customer [mix]: Of course they did. 35块才免运费。真棒啊。

Customer Support [mix]: I know, I know, it's frustrating. 你看，我能做的是...哎等一下。你从2019年就是我们的客户了，我可以把你加到我们的legacy customer program里。用代码LEGACY-VIP-24，你就能永久保持25块的免运费门槛。

Customer [mix]: Legacy customer. 嗯，那如果我还要退其他东西呢？

Customer Support [mix]: So with that program, 呃，你每年有三次免费退货，不管什么时候退都行。超过三次就是标准政策了，但老实说三次对大部分人都够用了。你的账户dashboard会显示剩余次数，每年1月1号重置。

Customer [mix]: I think that's... sort of reasonable? 可能吧？这什么时候开始生效？

Customer Support [mix]: Already activated it while we were talking. 确认号CNF-4429-LJKM应该会发给你，呃...等我们更新完邮箱就会发过去。说到这个，你现在的邮箱地址是？

Customer [mix]: It's jmartin seventy-two at gmail. 就是jmartin72，Gmail的。

Customer Support [mix]: Perfect, got it. 啊，好了，现在都更新完了。24小时内你会收到legacy program的欢迎邮件，里面列了所有的福利。其实除了我刚才说的，还有一些挺不错的优惠。

Customer [mix]: Perks. Sure. 应该就是想留住客户不让大家走吧。

Customer Support [mix]: *exhales* I mean... yeah, essentially that's what it is. 说实话吧，10月15号之后我们确实流失了很多客户。管理层意识到他们需要，呃，照顾好长期客户。不过这个program确实挺实在的—有优先客服专线，独家折扣，这类东西。

Customer [mix]: Priority support. 所以下次有什么改动我就会知道了？

Customer Support [mix]: Absolutely. 呃，就是说，你会在任何政策变更前至少两周收到通知，email和短信都会发，如果你想要的话。短信会发到我们存档的415-555-0892，假设这个号码还在用？


=== Original (English) ===

Customer: Let me see here... I got charged a restocking fee? That's never been a thing before.

Customer Support: Oh okay, hmm, let me pull up your account real quick... account number A5527-PKL. So yeah, we did update our return policy as of October 15th, and restocking fees now apply to electronics returned after 14 days.

Customer: October fifteenth. Nobody told me. I mean, probably should've sent an email or something?

Customer Support: You're absolutely right about that. *exhales* We did send notifications but, uh, checking here... looks like yours went to an old email address ending in @hotmail. The one we have is from 2019, so that's definitely on us for not verifying.

Customer: Hotmail, wait no, that's—sorry, I switched to Gmail years ago.

Customer Support: Right right. Mmm, what I can do here is update that to your current email, and actually, since this was kind of our communication breakdown, I'm gonna waive that restocking fee. Transaction ID TXN-9981-RV shows thirty-two fifty, so that'll be credited back within 3-5 business days.

Customer: Huh. Okay so that means... other policies changed too probably?

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Yeah unfortunately quite a few things shifted. Er, the big ones are the restocking fees, shipping minimums went from twenty-five to thirty-five dollars for free shipping, and warranty extensions now need to be purchased within 7 days instead of 30.

Customer: Of course they did. Thirty-five for free shipping. Great.

Customer Support: I know, I know, it's frustrating. Look, what I could do is... actually hang on. Since you've been with us since 2019, I can add you to our legacy customer program. Code LEGACY-VIP-24 gets you the old twenty-five dollar minimum permanently.

Customer: Legacy customer. Hmm, what if I need to return something else?

Customer Support: So with that program, um, you get three no-fee returns per year regardless of the timeline. After that it's the standard policy, but honestly three covers most people. Your account dashboard will show remaining returns, and the counter resets every January first.

Customer: I think that's... sort of reasonable? Maybe? When's this start?

Customer Support: Already activated it while we were talking. Confirmation number CNF-4429-LJKM should hit your, er... well, once we update your email it'll come through. Speaking of which, what's the current address?

Customer: It's jmartin seventy-two at gmail.

Customer Support: Perfect, got it. Ahhh, okay so everything's updated now. You'll get a welcome packet for the legacy program within 24 hours, and it lists all the benefits. There's actually some pretty decent perks beyond what I mentioned.

Customer: Perks. Sure. Probably just trying to keep people from leaving.

Customer Support: *exhales* I mean... yeah, essentially that's what it is. Between you and me, we lost a lot of customers after October fifteenth. Management realized they needed to, uh, take care of the long-term folks. The program's actually solid though—priority support line, exclusive sales, that kind of thing.

Customer: Priority support. So next time something changes I'll know?

Customer Support: Absolutely. Errr, well, you'll get notified at least two weeks in advance of any policy changes, sent to both email and SMS if you want. Text alerts go to the 415-555-0892 number we have on file, assuming that's still current?
