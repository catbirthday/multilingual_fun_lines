=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [mix]: 我已经等了20分钟了！你们的automated system连最基本的账户信息都听不懂。

Customer Support [mix]: 真的非常抱歉让您有这样frustrating的体验。我现在马上直接帮您处理，请问您能提供一下account number或者关联的email地址吗？

Customer [mix]: 邮箱是thompson.j.wright@techcorpindustries.com。我得在明天扣款前把billing information更新了。

Customer Support [mix]: 谢谢。我找到您的账户了，尾号是4782。我看到您有个premium subscription，每月$89.99，scheduled to renew tomorrow at 3:00 AM Eastern。我现在就帮您更新付款信息。

Customer [mix]: 对的。之前的卡因为fraud被取消了，I have the new card ready.

Customer Support [mix]: 我完全理解。为了安全验证，能请您确认一下目前卡的最后4位数字和billing zip code吗？

Customer [mix]: 最后四位是7734，zip code是94105。

Customer Support [mix]: 很好，谢谢您的确认。您的账户显示是verified status level 2。我现在可以帮您更新payment method了，请您准备好了就告诉我新卡号。

Customer [mix]: 新卡号是4532-8901-2345-6789，expiration March 2026，CVV 445。

Customer Support [mix]: 好的。我已经成功更新了您的payment method，尾号6789的新卡现在是您的默认付款方式，I've confirmed it will process tomorrow's renewal without any issues.

Customer [mix]: 好。你能确认一下我current subscription里都包括哪些服务吗？

Customer Support [mix]: 当然可以。您的premium package包括500GB的unlimited data storage，priority support access响应时间2小时内，advanced analytics dashboard，还有API access每天最多10,000 calls。

Customer [mix]: 我想加个team collaboration module，这个要多少钱？

Customer Support [mix]: 当然。

Customer [mix]: 那我确认了就immediately生效吗？

Customer Support [mix]: Team collaboration module每月额外$29.99，您的总费用会变成$119.98。这个包括最多25个用户的workspace sharing，real-time editing capabilities，还有90天的version control history retention。

Customer [mix]: 行，那就加到我账户上，然后send confirmation to my email.

Customer Support [mix]: 我已经成功把team collaboration module加到您的账户了，立即生效。您会在接下来5分钟内收到确认邮件TCM-8847-CONF，your team can begin setup right away using access code TC-94105-INIT.

Customer [mix]: 完美。谢谢你处理得这么有效率，much better than the automated system.

Customer Support [mix]: 不客气。我完全理解您对automated system的不满，我已经在您的账户上做了备注，以后会priority agent routing。今天还有什么其他需要帮忙的吗？

Customer: I've been trying to reach support for twenty minutes. Your automated system couldn't understand basic account information.

Customer Support: I sincerely apologize for that frustrating experience. Let me help you directly right now. I'll need your account number or the email address associated with your account to get started.

Customer: The account email is thompson.j.wright@techcorpindustries.com. I need to update billing information before tomorrow's charge.

Customer Support: Thank you. I've located your account ending in 4782. I can see you have a premium subscription at $89.99 monthly that's scheduled to renew tomorrow at 3:00 AM Eastern. Let me help you update that billing information immediately.

Customer: Correct. The card on file was cancelled due to fraud. I have the new card ready.

Customer Support: I understand completely. For security verification, could you please confirm the last 4 digits of the current card on file and the billing zip code?
