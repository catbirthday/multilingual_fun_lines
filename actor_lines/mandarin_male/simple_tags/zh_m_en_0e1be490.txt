=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] I need to close our joint account, all of it, today. [pause] Don't pretend you don't know why I'm here, standing at your window like just another customer.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Please, not here, not like this. [clearing throat] I have a supervisor watching, and there are security cameras recording everything we say right now.

Character 1 [en]: [coldly] Seven years, that's how long you've been siphoning money into that other account. [sarcastic] Did you really think I wouldn't eventually notice the patterns in our statements?

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] It wasn't what you think it was. [sighs] Every single dollar went toward paying off my mother's medical debts before she died, debts I never told you about.

Character 1 [en]: Your mother died four years ago, but the withdrawals continued until last week when I finally got suspicious enough to dig through your desk drawer.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Fine. Yes.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Thirty-eight thousand dollars over seven years, calculated down to avoid triggering alerts. [harsh] You used your position here to hide it from me, your own expertise against me.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] The gambling started after Mom died, just scratch tickets at first, then [pause] online poker, then everything else spiraled out of control so fast.

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] We were supposed to buy that house by the lake, remember? [quietly] The one with the wraparound porch where we'd drink coffee and watch the sunrise together.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I remember every detail of that dream, how you described the kitchen windows, the garden you'd plant. [sniffle] I destroyed everything we built together, didn't I?

Character 1 [en]: [stern] The withdrawal forms, please. [long pause] I need two copies, and I want confirmation that my name is completely removed from all associated accounts today.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] There's something else you need to know before you sign those papers. [very quietly] I've been in recovery for six months now, attending meetings every morning before work.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Six months of sobriety doesn't erase seven years of lies. [bitter] Every anniversary dinner, every vacation we couldn't afford, every time you said we needed to be more careful with money.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] You're right to leave, to take your half and never look back. [sighs] I just wanted you to know that I finally understood what I was losing.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Understanding comes too late sometimes. [pause] The house, the dreams, the trust, they're all just entries in a ledger now, balanced and closed.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Remember that first time you came to my window, asking about interest rates? [sad] You were wearing that blue dress, and I couldn't stop staring at your smile.

Character 1 [en]: [melancholic] That was a different person, someone who believed in futures and joint accounts and [trailing off] shared dreams that actually meant something to both people involved.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] The papers are printing now, it'll just take a minute. [shaky voice] After this, you won't have any legal connection to me or my disasters anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Good. [pause] That's exactly what I need, a clean break with proper documentation and no loose ends to haunt me later. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I loved you, still do, more than any addiction or compulsion ever controlled me. [pause] But love without trust is just another bad investment, isn't it?
