Scenario: A desperate homeowner meets with a well drilling specialist to discuss emergency water access after their property's well ran dry, only to discover the specialist is their ex-spouse's sibling who blamed them for the divorce.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Hi, I called about the emergency well consultation? My property's completely dry and I was told you were the only one available this week. [pause] I really need someone who can start immediately.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Rebecca? [clearing throat] I didn't realize the Mitchell property was yours now. The office just gave me an address and said it was urgent.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Oh my God, Tyler.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah, it's been what, six years since the divorce? [slowly] I guess you got the house in the settlement after all, just like everything else my sister owned. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Look, I understand if you want to leave, but I'm desperate here. [anxiously] The well died three days ago, we're hauling water from town for basic needs, and no one else can come for two weeks.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Of course I'm not leaving. [firmly] Despite what you might think, I'm a professional, and you need water. Let me get my equipment and we'll find where to drill. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: The old well was there, by the oak tree, but it just stopped producing Tuesday morning, no warning at all.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] How deep was the original well? [quickly] And have your neighbors reported any issues? Sometimes the whole water table drops in this area during drought years.

Character 1 [en]: [nervously] About 180 feet, drilled in 1987 according to the records. [quietly] The Johnsons next door said their well dropped significantly but it's still producing. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Tyler, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] You know what exactly? That my sister spent three years in therapy after you left? [very quietly] That she still can't drive past this place without crying?

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] I never meant for things to end that way. [empathetically] Sarah and I, we just grew apart, and I tried to make it work but sometimes love isn't enough. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] Right, love wasn't enough. [bitter] But apparently keeping the house, the car, and half her retirement was exactly enough for you. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] That's not fair and you know it! [upset] The mediator divided everything according to state law, I didn't ask for anything extra, and I left her all the furniture, all our friends, everything!

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] You're right. [very slowly] I'm sorry, that wasn't professional of me. [quietly] Your well situation, we need to focus on that. The ground here feels different, might be bedrock shift. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Thank you. [anxiously] How long would a new well take to drill if the bedrock has shifted? And what are we looking at cost-wise?

Character 2 [en]: [professionally] Depends on how deep we need to go. [thoughtfully] If the aquifer's dropped below 250 feet, we're talking three days minimum, maybe fifteen thousand with the pump system. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] I don't have that kind of money right now. [shaky voice] The divorce cleaned me out too, Tyler, despite what you think. This house is all I have left.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Please help me.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I'll drill your well, Rebecca. [empathetically] We can work out a payment plan, and I know a guy who has surplus pump equipment. [slowly] Maybe it's time we both stopped letting the past poison everything. [pause]
