=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] What the hell—Marcus?

Character 2 [en]: [groaning] Don't just stand there.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] The building was supposed to be empty, we cleared it twice yesterday. [quickly] How did you even get in here? The whole perimeter's been sealed since Tuesday.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah well, your security isn't as tight as you think. [coughs] My leg's pinned under this beam and I can't feel anything below my knee.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Don't move it, could make things worse. [frustrated] Of all the buildings in this city, you had to break into the one I'm bringing down today?

Character 2 [en]: [strained] Wasn't exactly planning on a reunion. [gasps] The documents I needed were in the basement safe—thought I had more time before the actual demolition started.

Character 1 [en]: Jesus, the charges for the east wall go off in twelve minutes. [anxiously] We need to get you out now or this whole section comes down on both of us.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically] Great, so now my life's in your hands. [groans] After everything you cost me, this is how it ends—you deciding whether I live or die.

Character 1 [en]: [sternly] Shut up and listen—when I lift this beam, you're going to slide backward on three. [clearing throat] Don't try to stand, just slide straight back toward that opening.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Why are you helping me? After what I did to your sister, the lawsuit, everything—you could just walk away and no one would know.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Because I'm not you, Marcus. [grunting] One... two... three—move! [straining] Keep going, don't stop until you're completely clear of the debris.

Character 2 [en]: [breathing heavily] My ankle's definitely broken but I'm out. [pause] The safe combination is 47-23-89 if you want those documents—they prove you were right about the contractor fraud.

Character 1 [en]: Forget the documents, we've got eight minutes to clear the blast radius. [urgently] Put your arm around my shoulder—we're both getting out of here alive whether we hate each other or not.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Thank you.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Save it for when we're clear. [quickly] That siren means the final warning—we need to move faster or we're both going to be part of this rubble pile.

Character 2 [en]: You know, Sarah always said you were decent underneath all that anger. [wincing] Guess dying together wasn't how I pictured finding out she was right about something.

Character 1 [en]: [angrily] Don't you dare mention her name right now. [exhales] Just focus on moving—left foot, drag, right foot, drag—we're almost to the safety perimeter.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] There's the medical team by the barriers. [coughs] For what it's worth, I never meant for things to go as far as they did between us.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Yeah well, we made it out, that's what matters. [firmly] After they patch you up, you and I are done—no more buildings, no more surprises, nothing.

Character 2 [en]: [regretfully] Understood, I'll disappear from your life completely this time. [quietly] But those documents in the safe—they clear your name on the Marina project. Consider us even.
