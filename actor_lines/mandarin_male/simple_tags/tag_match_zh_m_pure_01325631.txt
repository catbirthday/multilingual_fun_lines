=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [坚定地] 所以你发现了发信器。[停顿] 我还在想要多久呢—你比大多数人想的都要敏锐，船长。

Character 2 [pure]: [苦涩] 6个月了，你在我船上待了6个月，跟我一起吃饭，火拼的时候护着我的后背。[非常小声] 这些...有哪件是真的？还是说，我对你来说就是另一个目标而已？

Character 1 [pure]: [犹豫地] 任务...怎么说呢，任务是真的，但是我对你和这帮兄弟产生的敬意—这个确实出乎我的意料。[叹气] 你跟简报里说的完全不一样。

Character 2 [pure]: [讽刺] 哎呦，厉害啊，CIA特工敬佩她监视的罪犯了。[大声地] 这就能让我对背后这一刀感觉好点了？

Character 1 [pure]: [同情地] 你把医疗物资运到我政府根本不管的战区。[非常真诚] 你船员有一半都是你给了第二次机会的难民—这些情报档案里可都没有。

Character 2 [pure]: [愤怒] 别装作你懂我们在干什么！[呼气] 你们这些人啊，看到的只是海盗和恐怖分子，看不到被遗弃的渔村，看不到那些因为企业污染了水源而挨饿的孩子。

Character 1 [pure]: [轻声] 我弟弟在索马里饥荒期间运送物资时死了。[长停顿] 我完全知道绝望是什么样子，也知道谁在从中牟利。

Character 2 [pure]: [困惑] 那你为什么还—

Character 1 [pure]: [后悔] 因为有人在利用你的航线走私武器，而且落到了不该拿到的人手里—上个月在大马士革，这些武器杀了我三个同事。

Character 2 [pure]: [愤怒] 你觉得我在贩卖军火？[大喊] 我建立的一切，我们牺牲的一切，你觉得我会为了贩卖死亡把这些都扔掉？

Character 1 [pure]: [快速地] 不，我不这么认为。

Character 2 [pure]: [怀疑] 但是你的上级这么想，所以你才带着你那些小玩意儿和加密报告来这里。[嘲笑地] 告诉我，我们下棋的事你都写了什么？[叹气]

Character 1 [pure]: [温暖] 我写你总是想三步以后，但是为了保护小兵会把皇后暴露在外。[轻笑] 你宁可输掉整盘棋也不愿意牺牲最弱的棋子。

Character 2 [pure]: [若有所思地] 我船上有人在背着我运那些武器。[非常小声] 你真正想说的是这个，对吧？

Character 1 [pure]: [松了口气] 货单和重量分布对不上，而且你的大副有些停靠点不在你的航海日志里。[停顿] 我想我们都知道真正的敌人是谁了。

Character 2 [pure]: [严厉] 如果我帮你，我的船员必须得到保护—不能抓人，不能冻结账户，不能突然冒出什么通缉令。[坚定地] 这是我的条件，没得商量。

Character 1 [pure]: [自信地] 我能办到，但我们得快点行动。[焦虑] 他明晚要跟接头人见面，之后那些武器就会永远消失在黑市里。

Character 2 [pure]: 你知道你在要求我做什么吗—背叛我自己人，一个跟了我8年的兄弟。[声音渐弱]

Character 1 [pure]: [同情地] 他利用你的生意作掩护，早就背叛你了。[热情地] 帮我阻止他，我保证让全世界都知道你从来就不是这事的一部分。

Character 2 [pure]: [缓慢地] 这事结束以后，你从我的生活里彻底消失。[非常真诚] 但是今晚，我们一起把这事了结—为了我的船员，也为了你死去的同事。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [坚定地] So you found the transmitter. [停顿] I wondered how long it would take—you're sharper than most people give you credit for, captain.

Character 2: [苦涩] Six months you've been on my ship, eating at my table, watching my back in firefights. [非常小声] Was any of it real, or was I just another mark to you?

Character 1: [犹豫地] The job was real, yes, but the respect I developed for you and this crew—that caught me by surprise. [叹气] You're not what my briefing suggested.

Character 2: [讽刺] Oh brilliant, the CIA agent respects the criminal she's been spying on. [大声地] That supposed to make me feel better about the knife in my back?

Character 1: [同情地] You run medical supplies to war zones that my government ignores. [非常真诚] Half your crew are refugees you've given second chances to—that's not in any intelligence file.

Character 2: [愤怒] Don't pretend you understand what we do here! [呼气] Your people see pirates and terrorists, not the abandoned fishing villages or the kids starving because corporations poisoned their waters.

Character 1: [轻声] My brother died running supplies to Somalia during the famine. [长停顿] I know exactly what desperation looks like, and I know who profits from it.

Character 2: [困惑] Then why?

Character 1: [后悔] Because someone's using your shipping routes to move weapons that are ending up in the wrong hands—weapons that killed three of my colleagues last month in Damascus.

Character 2: [愤怒] You think I'm trafficking arms? [大喊] Everything I've built, everything we've sacrificed, and you think I'd throw it away to deal death?

Character 1: [快速地] No, I don't.

Character 2: [怀疑] But your handlers do, which is why you're here with your little gadgets and encrypted reports. [嘲笑地] Tell me, what did you write about our chess games? [叹气]

Character 1: [温暖] That you play three moves ahead but leave your queen exposed when you're protecting your pawns. [轻笑] That you'd rather lose the game than sacrifice the weakest pieces.

Character 2: [若有所思地] Someone on my crew is moving those weapons without my knowledge. [非常小声] That's what you're really saying, isn't it?

Character 1: [松了口气] The manifests don't match the weight distributions, and there are stops your first mate makes that aren't in your logs. [停顿] I think we both know who the real enemy is.

Character 2: [严厉] If I help you, my crew stays protected—no arrests, no frozen accounts, no suddenly discovered warrants. [坚定地] Those are my terms, non-negotiable.

Character 1: [自信地] I can make that happen, but we need to move fast. [焦虑] He's meeting his contact tomorrow night, and after that, the weapons disappear into the black market forever.

Character 2: You realize what you're asking me to do—to betray one of my own, someone who's sailed with me for eight years. [声音渐弱]

Character 1: [同情地] He already betrayed you by using your operation as cover. [热情地] Help me stop him, and I'll make sure the world knows you were never part of this.

Character 2: [缓慢地] After this is over, you disappear from my life completely. [非常真诚] But tonight, we finish this together—for my crew, and for your dead colleagues.
