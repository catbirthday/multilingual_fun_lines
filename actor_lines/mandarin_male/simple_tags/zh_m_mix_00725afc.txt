=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [frustrated] Of all the places for this piece of junk to die, 偏偏就死在你的工地中间。[sighs] Look, 我知道发生那件事之后，你大概不想帮我。

Character 2 [mix]: Push it to the shoulder before someone rear-ends you. 来吧，你在后面推，我来掌方向盘。

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] Thanks, Marcus.

Character 2 [mix]: [stern] Don't thank me yet. [pause] We're just clearing a hazard from my work zone, 这只是标准程序而已，没别的。

Character 1 [mix]: [apologetic] I never got to explain what happened that night at the warehouse. [shaky voice] 他们说你偷工具的时候，我没有替你说话，你完全有理由恨我。

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] Cost me my job, my reputation, 十五年的心血全都毁了。[quietly] All because you were too scared, 就因为你不敢告诉他们是你把钥匙借给我的。

Character 1 [mix]: [regretful] I was twenty-two and terrified of losing my apprenticeship. [pause] 这不是借口，只是这八年来我一直背负着的真相。

Character 2 [mix]: [exhales] You know what the worst part was? [slowly] 我真的以为我们是朋友，以为关键时刻你会挺我。

Character 1 [mix]: [very quietly] We were friends. [voice breaking] 正因为这样，我的懦弱更加不可原谅，所以我永远无法原谅自己让你背了黑锅。

Character 2 [mix]: [curious] Is that why you switched from construction to vehicle wraps? [pause] 是不是因为不敢再在工地工作，怕碰到我？

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] Partly, yeah. [sighs] 但也是因为每次拿起工具，都会想起我害你失去的一切，想起我因为太软弱不敢说实话而毁掉的东西。

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] You want to know something ironic? 被炒鱿鱼反而推了我一把，让我加入了工会，接受正规培训，还有真正的福利。

Character 1 [mix]: [surprised] Wait, seriously? [hopefully] 你是说那场噩梦居然带来了好的结果？

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] I'm saying I survived it, 从废墟中重建了更好的生活。[pause] 这不能抹掉你做的事，但我也不再是当年那个愤怒的年轻人了。

Character 1 [mix]: [sincerely] I've wanted to make this right for so long. [quickly] 我可以打电话给你原来的老板，现在就告诉他真相，正式为你平反，如果这能有任何帮助的话。

Character 2 [mix]: [thoughtfully] That company went under four years ago, 恶有恶报，他们终于得到报应了。[chuckles] But I appreciate you finally being willing to own it.

Character 1 [mix]: [relieved] Your crew's almost done with this section, right? [nervously] 等你下班之后，咱们去喝一杯吧，我可以好好道歉，不用在时速70英里的车流旁边说话。

Character 2 [mix]: [considering] One beer. [firmly] 你得请前三轮，一边喝一边解释为什么花了八年时间，还得等到货车抛锚才终于长出脊梁骨。

Character 1 [mix]: [laughs] Fair enough. [gratefully] 只要能有机会弥补我们之间的关系，我愿意请到打烊。

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] Better call that tow truck first though. [grinning] 不能让你在我的工地又丢下一个烂摊子，特别是我们刚开始和解的时候。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [frustrated] Of all the places for this piece of junk to die, it had to be right in the middle of your construction zone. [sighs] Look, I know you probably don't want to help me after what happened.

Character 2: Push it to the shoulder before someone rear-ends you. Come on, I'll help steer while you push from behind.

Character 1: [quietly] Thanks, Marcus.

Character 2: [stern] Don't thank me yet. [pause] We're just clearing a hazard from my work zone, nothing more than standard protocol here.

Character 1: [apologetic] I never got to explain what happened that night at the warehouse. [shaky voice] You have every right to hate me for not vouching for you when they accused you of stealing those tools.

Character 2: [bitter] Cost me my job, my reputation, everything I'd built over fifteen years. [quietly] All because you were too scared to tell them you'd lent me the keys.

Character 1: [regretful] I was twenty-two and terrified of losing my apprenticeship. [pause] That's not an excuse, just the truth I've been carrying around for eight years now.

Character 2: [exhales] You know what the worst part was? [slowly] I actually thought we were friends, thought you'd have my back when it mattered.

Character 1: [very quietly] We were friends. [voice breaking] That's what made my cowardice even worse, and why I've never been able to forgive myself for letting you take the fall.

Character 2: [curious] Is that why you switched from construction to vehicle wraps? [pause] Couldn't face working on sites anymore, knowing you might run into me?

Character 1: [hesitantly] Partly, yeah. [sighs] But also because every tool I picked up reminded me of what I'd cost you, what I'd destroyed because I was too weak to speak up.

Character 2: [warmly] You want to know something ironic? Getting fired from that job was the push I needed to join the union, get proper training, actual benefits.

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, seriously? [hopefully] So you're saying something good actually came from that whole nightmare?

Character 2: [firmly] I'm saying I survived it, made something better from the wreckage. [pause] Doesn't erase what you did, but I'm not that angry kid anymore either.

Character 1: [sincerely] I've wanted to make this right for so long. [quickly] I could call your old boss, tell him the truth now, clear your name officially if that would help anything.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] That company went under four years ago, karma finally caught up with them. [chuckles] But I appreciate you finally being willing to own it.

Character 1: [relieved] Your crew's almost done with this section, right? [nervously] Maybe after you clock out, we could grab a beer, and I could properly apologize without traffic whizzing by at seventy miles per hour.

Character 2: [considering] One beer. [firmly] And you're buying the first three rounds while you explain exactly why it took eight years and a broken van for you to finally grow a spine.

Character 1: [laughs] Fair enough. [gratefully] I'll buy rounds until closing if it means having a chance to make things right between us.

Character 2: [warmly] Better call that tow truck first though. [grinning] Can't have you abandoning another responsibility in my work zone just when we're starting to clear the air between us.
