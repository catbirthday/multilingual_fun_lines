=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I know who you are, um, I've been cleaning up after your, [confused], secret art installations for weeks now and, well, I haven't told anyone yet because, [quietly], I think what you're doing is actually, you know, kind of beautiful.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You've been watching me this whole time and never, [anxious], said anything to security or my mother? [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] The way you place those pieces exactly where the light hits them at sunset, [empathetically], it reminds me of when I used to paint before life got complicated.

Character 2 [en]: Well, you used to paint too, um, so you understand why I can't just, [bitter], hang my work through proper channels when they'd never, I mean, [frustrated], accept anything that challenges their precious status quo.

Character 1 [en]: [understanding] Your mother walks past my cleaning cart every morning without, [slowly], seeing me but I've watched her stop at your hidden pieces and, [shaky voice], touch them like she's trying to remember something she lost. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] She chose this sterile museum life over supporting my art when I was seventeen and needed her most, [angry], but now she gets to admire my work without, [regretful], knowing it's mine.

Character 1 [en]: I keep a notebook, you know, of all the visitors who, [thoughtful], discover your hidden pieces and, um, the way their faces change when they realize it's not supposed to be there. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [passionate] That's exactly what art should do, um, shake people out of their, [excited], comfortable gallery stroll and make them question everything they thought they, well, [speeding up], knew about what belongs and what doesn't, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] There's a storage room in the east wing that nobody checks anymore where, [whispering], you could work without sneaking around at three in the morning.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] You'd risk your job helping someone who's basically, [nervously], vandalizing your workplace with unauthorized exhibitions? [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [sincere] Twenty-three years I've been invisible in these halls but watching you, [proudly], rebel against everything this place represents makes me remember who I, [trailing off], used to be before... [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [moved] Um, nobody's ever understood why I do this, like, they all think it's about, [vulnerable], revenge or attention but you actually, er, [very quietly], see what I'm trying to say. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: Your mother keeps every newspaper clipping about mysterious art appearing in galleries across the city in her desk drawer which I dust around but, [carefully], never disturb because I think she knows exactly, [whispering loudly], who's behind them all.

Character 2 [en]: She knows it's me but won't admit it because that would mean, [sad], acknowledging she was wrong about my art all those years ago. [deep pitch]

Character 1 [en]: The new exhibit opening next month has an empty pedestal in the main hall that's supposedly for a piece that hasn't arrived yet but I heard the curator say they're, [mischievous], leaving it empty on purpose hoping something, [playful], magical might appear there.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, are you saying they're actually, um, inviting me to leave something there without, [shocked], officially acknowledging it's me, like, some kind of, you know, institutional permission to be rebellious?

Character 1 [en]: [confident] I've been here long enough to know when the board is, [animated], desperate for authenticity and your underground pieces have brought more visitors than their last, [laughing], five traditional exhibitions combined. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [contemplative] Maybe being invisible in a place gives you the clearest view of what's, [grateful], really happening behind all the polished surfaces and opening night champagne.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, you know, maybe.

Character 2 [en]: [tender] How about we both stop being invisible and create something together that, [determined], forces everyone in this place to finally see what they've been missing? [laugh]
