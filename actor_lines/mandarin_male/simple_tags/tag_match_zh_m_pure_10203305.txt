=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [惊讶] 我操，谁在那儿？[大声地] 我知道有人进来了——我听见后窗被砸了，警报器也被弄坏了，赶紧出来，不然我报警了啊。

Character 2 [pure]: [耳语] 别报警，求求你别报警。[颤抖的声音] 我真不是来偷东西的。[颤抖的声音] 我就是...就是需要找个地方躲几个小时，等他们搜完这片儿再说。

Character 1 [pure]: [紧张地] 你砸我窗户就为了躲着？[沮丧] 这些手风琴值好几万呢，有些都是百年古董了，然后你跟我说你——就是路过？

Character 2 [pure]: [快速地] 我不知道这是手风琴店，我就看见巷子里这个入口，灯也关着。[绝望] 听我说，窗户钱我赔，我有现金，就给我两小时。[停顿]

Character 1 [pure]: 两小时干啥？[叹气] 你血都滴我波斯地毯上了，满地都是玻璃碴子，然后你要我装作啥都没看见？

Character 2 [pure]: [坚定地] 那一小时。

Character 1 [pure]: [严厉] 这可不是菜市场讨价还价。[清嗓子] 你闯进来的，明显是在躲什么大事儿，现在我还得给你当同伙？

Character 2 [pure]: [苦涩] 我没干他们说的那些事。[轻声] 我前夫是条子，我想跟他离婚，他就栽赃陷害，现在突然说我贩毒，莫名其妙就通缉我了。

Character 1 [pure]: 贩毒指控。[呼气] 所以你是说，警犬队可能正往这儿赶，我的店要变案发现场了？[讽刺] 越来越精彩了哈。

Character 2 [pure]: [焦虑] 他们不知道我在这儿，我从下水道绕回来的，从三条街外的地方钻出来的。[快速地] 没人看见我进来，砸窗户之前我确认过了。

Character 1 [pure]: [犹豫地] 下水道——怪不得这味儿。[叹气] 这样吧，修理台后面有个储藏室，没窗户的，你要真就需要一小时想想办法的话。

Character 2 [pure]: [惊讶] 你真要帮我？[轻声] 我砸了你的窗户，血还滴你地毯上了？[松了口气] 我不明白，你为啥要为一个陌生人冒这个险。[停顿]

Character 1 [pure]: 我爷爷战争时期在波兰躲了三年官府，睡过谷仓，睡过地窖。[轻声地] 他总说，帮他的那些人，几乎没怎么犹豫过。

Character 2 [pure]: [非常小声] 我有个女儿，7岁，现在跟我姐住。[颤抖的声音] 要是他们抓到我，我再也见不到她了——我前夫肯定会通过法院确保这一点。

Character 1 [pure]: [温暖地] 储藏室里有水池，架子上有急救箱。[坚定地] 把自己收拾干净，别出声，要是有人问，我就说窗户早就破了好几周了。[停顿]

Character 2 [pure]: 那些手风琴——他们不会注意到少没少东西吗？要是他们来的话，入室盗窃的标准程序是要清点库存的。

Character 1 [pure]: [自信地] 都上了保险，都有编目，啥都没动过，除了你现在靠着的那台19世纪的霍纳。[轻笑] 别把血弄上面了就行——那台是我最喜欢的。[叹气]

Character 2 [pure]: [歉意地] 天亮前我肯定走，我保证。[耳语] 我姐从萨克拉门托开车上来，4点半在5号公路的卡车停靠站接我。[呼气] 谢谢你。

Character 1 [pure]: 4点半还有三小时呢。[咳嗽] 我就在前面修这台斯坎达利，要是有人路过看见灯亮着，显得正常点儿。

Character 2 [pure]: [感激] 这份恩情我不会忘的。[轻声] 等这事儿过去了，等我洗清冤屈，把生活找回来，我一定会报答你的。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [惊讶] Jesus Christ, who's there? [大声地] I know someone's in here—I heard the back window break and the alarm's been disabled, so just come out before I call the police.

Character 2: [耳语] Please don't call them, please, I'm not here to steal anything. [颤抖的声音] I just needed somewhere to hide for a few hours until the search moves past this neighborhood.

Character 1: [紧张地] You broke into my shop to hide? [沮丧] These accordions are worth thousands of dollars, some are century-old antiques, and you're telling me you're what—just passing through?

Character 2: [快速地] I didn't know it was an accordion shop, I just saw the alley entrance and the light was off. [绝望] Look, I'll pay for the window, I have cash, just give me two hours. [停顿]

Character 1: Two hours for what exactly? [叹气] You're bleeding on my Persian rug, there's glass everywhere, and you want me to pretend I didn't see any of this happening?

Character 2: [坚定地] One hour then.

Character 1: [严厉] That's not how negotiations work. [清嗓子] You broke in here, you're obviously running from something serious, and now I'm supposed to become an accessory to whatever you've done?

Character 2: [苦涩] I didn't do what they're saying I did. [轻声] My ex-husband's a cop, planted evidence after I tried to leave him, and now suddenly I'm wanted for distribution charges that came out of nowhere.

Character 1: Distribution charges. [呼气] So you're telling me there's probably a K-9 unit heading this way, and my shop's about to become a crime scene? [讽刺] This just keeps getting better.

Character 2: [焦虑] They don't know I'm here, I doubled back through the storm drains and came up three blocks away. [快速地] Nobody saw me enter, I made sure of that before breaking the window.

Character 1: [犹豫地] Storm drains—that explains the smell. [叹气] Look, there's a storage room behind the repair bench with no windows, if you really just need an hour to figure things out.

Character 2: [惊讶] You're actually going to help me? [轻声] After I broke your window and bled on your rug? [松了口气] I don't understand why you'd risk that for a complete stranger. [停顿]

Character 1: My grandfather spent three years hiding from authorities in Poland during the war, sleeping in barns and root cellars. [轻声地] He always said the people who helped him barely hesitated.

Character 2: [非常小声] I have a daughter, she's seven, stays with my sister now. [颤抖的声音] If they catch me, I'll never see her again—my ex will make sure of that through the courts.

Character 1: [温暖地] There's a sink in the storage room, first aid kit on the shelf. [坚定地] Clean yourself up, stay quiet, and I'll tell anyone who asks that the window's been broken for weeks. [停顿]

Character 2: The accordions—won't they notice if anything's missing? They'll want to check inventory if they come here, standard procedure for a break-in.

Character 1: [自信地] Everything's insured and catalogued, nothing's been touched except that nineteenth-century Hohner you're currently sitting behind. [轻笑] Just try not to bleed on it—that one's my personal favorite. [叹气]

Character 2: [歉意地] I'll be gone before dawn, I promise. [耳语] My sister's driving up from Sacramento, meeting me at the truck stop on Route 5 at four-thirty. [呼气] Thank you.

Character 1: Four-thirty gives you three hours. [咳嗽] I'll stay up front working on this Scandalli, make everything look normal if anyone passes by and sees the lights on.

Character 2: [感激] I won't forget this. [轻声] When this is over, when I get my life back and clear my name, I'll find a way to repay you for this kindness.
