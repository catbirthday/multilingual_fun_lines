=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [焦虑地] 我已经...已经试了三天了，想引起别人注意，你是第一个真正能听见我说话的人。[停顿] 那些施工队的人就...就直接从我身体穿过去，但你听到我叫你就停下来了。

Character 2 [pure]: [困惑] 这不可能啊，你...呃...你不可能是真的，我肯定是项目压力太大产生幻觉了。[呼气] 今年清算了28处房产，现在居然在君悦酒店看见鬼了。

Character 1 [pure]: [绝望地] 你明天早上签那些拆迁文件之前，一定要听我说。[绝望地] 这栋楼不只是砖瓦水泥那么简单，它在维系着一些你还不明白的东西。

Character 2 [pure]: [犹豫地] 就算我相信你是真的吧——我不是说我信啊——反正现在也做不了什么了。[叹气] 投资方已经批准卖给开发商了。

Character 1 [pure]: [非常忧郁] 1924年，我亲手建了这家酒店，每一片瓷砖，每一根扶手，都是想着我的子孙会在这些走廊里跑来跑去。[更轻声] 现在你们要把它全拆了，盖另一栋玻璃大楼。

Character 2 [pure]: [停顿] 这栋楼已经连续亏损15年了，地基有严重的结构问题，翻新成本远超任何可能的投资回报。[停顿] 对我来说这些只是数字而已。

Character 1 [pure]: [恳求] 但是还有17个像我一样的灵魂被困在这里，都是这几十年来在这里过世的人。[颤抖的声音] 你们毁了我们在这个世界的寄托，我们能去哪儿？

Character 2 [pure]: [同情地] 我从来没这样想过，就是说...在那些报表和利润率之外，还有真正的人的代价。[长停顿] 我的工作通常都很...怎么说呢...很冷冰冰的，离实际后果很远。

Character 1 [pure]: [温暖] 你让我想起了我女儿伊丽莎白，她考虑难题的时候也是这样皱着眉头。[叹气] 五十年代开董事会的时候，她就坐在你现在坐的那张椅子上。

Character 2 [pure]: [真诚地] 这太疯狂了，我居然在跟一个...比我父母出生还早就过世的人聊天。[紧张地笑] 但不知道为什么，这比我今年开的任何会议都感觉真实。

Character 1 [pure]: [急切地] 412房间那对年轻夫妇，1967年火灾那晚，他们新婚之夜就去世了。[声音哽咽] 他们现在还每个星期二在舞厅跳舞，等着那个永远不会回来的乐队。

Character 2 [pure]: [非常小声] 我外婆以前跟我讲过君悦舞厅的故事，说她1968年新年舞会上在这儿认识了我外公。[停顿] 我完全不知道火灾的事。

Character 1 [pure]: 那刚好是一年之后，我们很努力想把音乐带回来，想让这里重新有生气。[充满希望地] 你外公外婆在那些黑暗的日子里，帮我们记起了什么是快乐。

Character 2 [pure]: [矛盾地] 环评报告、规划许可，所有文件都已经报给市政府了。[呼气] 但是...历史保护这个角度，我可能还没完全探索过。

Character 1 [pure]: [兴奋] 你能救我们？[轻轻倒吸气] 这么多年看着开发商像秃鹰一样盘旋，终于有人愿意听听这个地方的意义了？

Character 2 [pure]: [自信地] 我需要历史意义的书面证明、建筑调查报告，可能还要老住户关于文化影响的证词。[加快语速] 拆迁队到达之前，我们最多还有72小时。

Character 1 [pure]: [松了口气] 我可以带你去看所有的原始设计图，就藏在地下室储藏间的假墙后面。[轻笑] 我的合伙人从来不知道我把所有东西都留了副本。

Character 2 [pure]: [坚定] 那就从那儿开始吧。

Character 1 [pure]: 你真的要帮我们，即使你们公司会因为阻止这笔交易损失那么多？[非常真诚] 我以为你们这行的人早就没有这种勇气了。

Character 2 [pure]: [坚定地] 有时候正确的选择不是赚钱的选择，我不想再假装不是这样了。[停顿] 带我去看那些设计图吧，看看我们能不能救下你的酒店，还有所有和它有关的人。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [焦虑地] I've been trying to get someone's attention for three days now, and you're the first person who actually seems to hear me. [停顿] The construction crew just walks right through me, but you stopped when I called out.

Character 2: [困惑] This is impossible, you can't be real, I must be hallucinating from the stress of this project. [呼气] Twenty-eight properties liquidated this year and now I'm seeing ghosts in the Grandview Hotel.

Character 1: You have to listen to me before you sign those demolition papers tomorrow morning. [绝望地] This building isn't just brick and mortar, it's holding something together that you don't understand yet.

Character 2: [犹豫地] Even if I believed you were real, which I'm not saying I do, there's nothing I can do at this point. [叹气] The investors have already approved the sale to the development group.

Character 1: [非常忧郁] I built this hotel in 1924 with my own hands, every tile, every banister, thinking my grandchildren would run through these halls. [更轻声] Now you're going to tear it all down for another glass tower.

Character 2: The building's been losing money for fifteen years, the foundation has serious structural issues, and renovation costs would exceed any possible return on investment. [停顿] These are just numbers to me.

Character 1: [恳求] But there are seventeen other souls tied to this place like me, people who died here over the decades. [颤抖的声音] Where do we go when you destroy our anchor to this world?

Character 2: [同情地] I've never thought about it that way before, the human cost beyond the spreadsheets and profit margins. [长停顿] My job is usually so clinical, so removed from actual consequences.

Character 1: [温暖] You remind me of my daughter Elizabeth, she had that same furrow in her brow when she was wrestling with difficult decisions. [叹气] She used to sit in that very chair during board meetings in the fifties.

Character 2: [真诚地] This is insane, I'm having a conversation with someone who died before my parents were even born. [紧张地笑] But somehow this feels more real than any meeting I've had all year.

Character 1: [急切地] The young couple in room 412, they died in the fire of 1967 on their wedding night. [声音哽咽] They still dance in the ballroom every Tuesday, waiting for the band that will never come back.

Character 2: [非常小声] My grandmother used to tell me stories about the Grandview ballroom, how she met my grandfather at a New Year's Eve dance here in 1968. [停顿] I had no idea about the fire.

Character 1: That was just one year after, we tried so hard to bring the music back, to make it feel alive again. [充满希望地] Your grandparents helped us remember what joy looked like in those dark months.

Character 2: [矛盾地] The environmental impact report, the zoning permits, everything's already been filed with the city. [呼气] But there might be a historical preservation angle I haven't fully explored.

Character 1: [兴奋] You could save us? [轻轻倒吸气] After all these years of watching developers circle like vultures, someone might actually listen to what this place means?

Character 2: [自信地] I'll need documented proof of historical significance, architectural surveys, and probably testimony from long-time residents about the cultural impact. [加快语速] We have maybe seventy-two hours before the demolition crew arrives.

Character 1: [松了口气] I can show you where all the original blueprints are hidden, behind the false wall in the basement storage room. [轻笑] My business partner never knew I kept copies of everything.

Character 2: [坚定] Let's start there.

Character 1: You're really going to help us, after everything your firm stands to lose from blocking this sale? [非常真诚] I didn't think anyone in your profession had that kind of courage anymore.

Character 2: [坚定地] Sometimes the right choice isn't the profitable one, and I'm tired of pretending otherwise. [停顿] Show me these blueprints, and let's see if we can save your hotel and everyone connected to it.
