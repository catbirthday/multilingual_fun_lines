[sigh] The shop used to be so busy I had to turn kids away, you know? September was like... it was like Christmas for me. All these sixth graders coming in with their rental returns, dented bells, stuck valves. [warm] God, I loved seeing their faces when they'd get their instruments back all shiny and working. But now it's just... eerily quiet. [pause] I mean, I get it, schools are cutting music programs left and right. Kids are all into, I don't know, coding clubs or whatever. [bitter] Nobody wants to learn an instrument that takes actual practice anymore. My dad taught me this trade when I was seventeen. [quietly] What am I supposed to do now, huh? Learn IT? Start over at fifty-four? I've got all these specialized tools, decades of knowledge about bore sizes and valve alignments and... [trailing off] And for what? [long pause] Sometimes I just sit here polishing the same old tuba from 1982, pretending things will turn around. But they won't. [very sad] They really won't."
