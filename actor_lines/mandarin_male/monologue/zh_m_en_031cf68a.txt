=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Three point seven meters and rising. That's... that's higher than anything we've seen since, um, since the records began in 1892. [anxiously] Everyone keeps calling, asking if we should evacuate, but they don't understand—if I abandon these locks now, we're looking at catastrophic contamination of the entire wetland system. 

[quickly] See, the industrial runoff from the Coleman facility is being held back by Lock Four right now. I've got it manually set to divert flow through the secondary channel, but that's, er... that's not something you can just leave on autopilot. [frustrated] The automated systems failed two hours ago when the power grid went down.

Twenty-three years I've worked these canals. Never thought I'd—man, never thought I'd need to remember the old hand-crank procedures. [exhausted] But muscle memory's a funny thing, you know? My hands just... they knew what to do. [pause] 

The water's actually starting to level off now. I can see it on the gauge—three point six eight. [relieved] We're holding. The bypass is working. 

[very quietly] People are going to wake up tomorrow with no idea how close we came to losing that entire ecosystem. Thirty thousand acres of protected wetland, nearly poisoned because, hmm, because some executive decided automated systems didn't need backup generators. [bitter] But we held the line. We held it.
