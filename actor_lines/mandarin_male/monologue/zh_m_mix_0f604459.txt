=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [gasp softly] 天啊，批下来了。Marcus的申请刚刚通过了。[relieved] 我简直不敢相信——我整个早上都在刷系统，it's right there on the screen. 百分之百的disability rating。[pause] 老天，他真的太应得这个了。三次tour，三次啊，and they made him jump through every hoop imaginable，就为了证明一件明明任何人花5分钟跟他待在一起就能看出来的事。[shaky voice] 这个人睡觉的时候都能听到根本不存在的爆炸声。去个超市都要先规划好所有的逃生路线。可他们还要，嗯……他们还要更多的文件证明。[frustrated] 更多文件，好像他的医疗记录还不够，好像他的证词还不够似的。[sigh] 但我们做到了。我们终于做到了。[warm] 他现在能接受正规治疗了。Real help, not just the runaround. 他可以不用再担心连电费都交不起，while he's trying to put himself back together. [crying while speaking] 我知道我不应该这么投入感情，但你怎么可能不呢？These are people who gave everything. [pause] 我现在就给他打电话。他需要马上知道这个消息。[extremely happy] Marcus肯定会哭的。妈的，我现在就已经在哭了。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Oh my God. It went through. The approval just came through for Marcus. [relieved] I can't even— I've been checking the system all morning and there it is, right there on the screen. Full disability rating. A hundred percent. [pause] God, he deserved this so much. Three tours, three tours and they made him jump through every hoop imaginable just to prove what was obvious to anyone who spent five minutes with him. [shaky voice] The man can't sleep without hearing explosions that aren't there. Can't go to the grocery store without planning exit routes. And they wanted, um... they wanted more documentation. [frustrated] More documentation, like his medical records weren't enough, like his testimony wasn't enough. [sigh] But we got it. We finally got it. [warm] He's going to be able to get proper treatment now. Real help, not just the runaround. He can stop worrying about keeping the lights on while he's trying to, uh, trying to put himself back together. [crying while speaking] I know I'm not supposed to get this invested but how can you not? These are people who gave everything. [pause] I'm calling him right now. He needs to know. [extremely happy] Marcus is going to cry. Hell, I'm already crying.
