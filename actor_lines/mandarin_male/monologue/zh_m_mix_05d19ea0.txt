=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [proud] 年度最佳活动家。That's what they're calling me. [short pause] 我现在拿着这个奖，应该觉得……怎么说呢，有成就感？[bitter] 但我满脑子想的都是Jake已经3个月不回我电话了。3个月。我们已经3个月没有真正聊过天了。[regretful] 我一直在说，你知道吧，"等这个活动结束后"，"等这次抗议完"，"就再参加一次集会"。而他就……他就点点头。[very quietly] 直到他不再点头了。[sigh] 我姐的孩子们都不认识我了。[upset] 她说——呃，她说我就像个陌生人，every holiday I show up with pamphlets instead of presents. 天啊。[frustrated] 问题是，这工作很重要，对吧？我们真的在拯救整个社区啊。但我自己的……嗯，我正在失去自己的家人。[crying while speaking] 妈昨天问我，改变世界是不是值得变成一个家人都不认识的人。我就——我就站在那里。[very melancholic] 因为说实话？我不知道自己在这个故事里是英雄，还是just really good at choosing strangers over the people who loved me first.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [proud] Top activist of the year. That's what they're calling me. [short pause] And here I am, holding this award, and I should feel... I don't know, accomplished? [bitter] But all I can think about is how Jake won't return my calls anymore. Three months. It's been three months since we actually talked. [regretful] I kept saying, you know, "after this campaign," "after this protest," "just one more rally." And he'd just... he'd nod. [very quietly] Until he stopped nodding. [sigh] My sister's kids don't even recognize me anymore. [upset] She said—um, she said I'm like a stranger who shows up for holidays with pamphlets instead of presents. God. [frustrated] The thing is, the work matters, right? Like, we're literally saving communities here. But I'm... hmm, I'm losing my own. [crying while speaking] Mom asked me yesterday if changing the world was worth becoming someone my family doesn't know anymore. And I couldn't—I just stood there. [very melancholic] Because honestly? I don't know if I'm the hero in this story or if I'm just... really good at choosing strangers over the people who loved me first.
