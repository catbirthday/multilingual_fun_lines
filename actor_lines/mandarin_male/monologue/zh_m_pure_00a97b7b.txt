=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: 天哪。结果——结果出来了。[shaky voice] 我有个match。很近的match，就是说...直系亲属那种近。[pause] 等等让我，呃，让我再看一遍，因为我有点— [gasp softly] 诶，等等。他们发了条消息。[very quietly] "我们找了你23年了。"

[crying while speaking] 23年。那是我这辈子啊，那是— [sniffle] 他们没有忘记我。我还以为可能，你知道吧，我只是个什么...他们想要忘掉的错误，但是他们一直在— [pause] 天啊，他们一直在找我。[laugh] 这太疯狂了。

[anxious] 好，那个，呃，有两个姐妹。我有姐妹？[very excited] 而且她们说我们的妈妈——我们的妈妈——她从来没有放弃过希望。[shaky voice] 她好像每个星期都会查这些网站，每个星期啊，二十多年了，就是...就是希望我会出现。

[hesitantly] 我该说什么啊？就说"嗨，我就是你们，呃，你们放弃的那个孩子"？[crying while speaking] 不对，等等，她们没有放弃我，她们——消息里说是有特殊情况。[sniffle] 什么法律上的问题之类的。

[relieved] 她们想见我。[extremely happy] 她们真的想见我。所有人都想。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: Oh my God. The results are—they're here. [shaky voice] I have a match. A close match, like... like immediate family close. [pause] Let me just, um, let me read this again because I can't quite— [gasp softly] Wait. They sent a message. [very quietly] "We've been looking for you for twenty-three years." 

[crying while speaking] Twenty-three years. That's my whole life, that's— [sniffle] They didn't forget about me. I thought maybe, you know, I was just some... some mistake they wanted to move past, but they've been— [pause] God, they've been searching this whole time. [laugh] This is insane. 

[anxious] Okay so there's, uh, there's two sisters. I have sisters? [very excited] And they say our mother—our mother—she never stopped hoping. [shaky voice] She apparently checks these sites every week, every single week for over two decades, just... just hoping I'd show up. 

[hesitantly] What do I even say to that? Like, "Hi, I'm the baby you, um, you gave up"? [crying while speaking] No, wait, they didn't give me up, they—the message says there were circumstances. [sniffle] Legal complications or something. 

[relieved] They want to meet. [extremely happy] They actually want to meet me. All of them.
