I've got it manually set to divert flow through the secondary channel, but that's, er... that's not something you can just leave on autopilot. [frustrated] The automated systems failed two hours ago when the power grid went down.\n\nTwenty-three years I've worked these canals. Never thought I'd—man, never thought I'd need to remember the old hand-crank procedures. [exhausted] But muscle memory's a funny thing, you know? My hands just... they knew what to do.

The bypass is working. \n\n[very quietly] People are going to wake up tomorrow with no idea how close we came to losing that entire ecosystem. Thirty thousand acres of protected wetland, nearly poisoned because, hmm, because some executive decided automated systems didn't need backup generators. [bitter] But we held the line. We held it."
