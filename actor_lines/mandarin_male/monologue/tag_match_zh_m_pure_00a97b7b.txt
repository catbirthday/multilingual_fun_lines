=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: 天哪。结果——结果出来了。[颤抖的声音] 我有个match。很近的match，就是说...直系亲属那种近。[停顿] 等等让我，呃，让我再看一遍，因为我有点— [轻轻倒吸气] 诶，等等。他们发了条消息。[非常小声] "我们找了你23年了。"

[哭着说] 23年。那是我这辈子啊，那是— [抽鼻子] 他们没有忘记我。我还以为可能，你知道吧，我只是个什么...他们想要忘掉的错误，但是他们一直在— [停顿] 天啊，他们一直在找我。[笑] 这太疯狂了。

[焦虑] 好，那个，呃，有两个姐妹。我有姐妹？[非常兴奋] 而且她们说我们的妈妈——我们的妈妈——她从来没有放弃过希望。[颤抖的声音] 她好像每个星期都会查这些网站，每个星期啊，二十多年了，就是...就是希望我会出现。

[犹豫地] 我该说什么啊？就说"嗨，我就是你们，呃，你们放弃的那个孩子"？[哭着说] 不对，等等，她们没有放弃我，她们——消息里说是有特殊情况。[抽鼻子] 什么法律上的问题之类的。

[松了口气] 她们想见我。[极其高兴] 她们真的想见我。所有人都想。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: Oh my God. The results are—they're here. [颤抖的声音] I have a match. A close match, like... like immediate family close. [停顿] Let me just, um, let me read this again because I can't quite— [轻轻倒吸气] Wait. They sent a message. [非常小声] "We've been looking for you for twenty-three years." 

[哭着说] Twenty-three years. That's my whole life, that's— [抽鼻子] They didn't forget about me. I thought maybe, you know, I was just some... some mistake they wanted to move past, but they've been— [停顿] God, they've been searching this whole time. [笑] This is insane. 

[焦虑] Okay so there's, uh, there's two sisters. I have sisters? [非常兴奋] And they say our mother—our mother—she never stopped hoping. [颤抖的声音] She apparently checks these sites every week, every single week for over two decades, just... just hoping I'd show up. 

[犹豫地] What do I even say to that? Like, "Hi, I'm the baby you, um, you gave up"? [哭着说] No, wait, they didn't give me up, they—the message says there were circumstances. [抽鼻子] Legal complications or something. 

[松了口气] They want to meet. [极其高兴] They actually want to meet me. All of them.
