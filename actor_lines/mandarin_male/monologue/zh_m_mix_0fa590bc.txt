=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [confused] 我刚刚读了3遍。Caroline Marsh—就是那个Caroline Marsh，the one who called my last piece "derivative drivel"—她刚写了我的作品是... [slowly] "breathtaking in its originality." [laugh] 什么鬼？[pause] 她用了"masterful"这个词。说的是我的作品。[bitter] 5年了，她在每一篇评论里都把我批得体无完肤。[frustrated] "缺乏深度"，她总这么说。"毫无灵感的选择。" [mocking] "让人不禁怀疑为什么还要继续。" [long pause] 现在突然间我就，呃... 我成天才了？[anxious] 也许她搞错名字了。[quickly] 肯定是这样，对吧？她本来想评论别人的，然后— [trailing off] 不对，她引用了具体的段落... [gasp softly] 我的天，她真的喜欢。[shaky voice] 这么长时间我一直想证明给她看。[upset] 每一次拒绝，每一个不屑的评论，我都让它折磨着我。[laugh hard] 那现在呢？现在我应该... 庆祝吗？[very quietly] 有一部分的我想把这篇评论裱起来。[bitter] 另一部分想告诉她滚远点。[sigh] 我都不知道该怎么面对这件事。[relieved] 也许这样也行。Maybe I don't owe her—or anyone—a reaction. [confidently] The work speaks for itself now.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [confused] I just read it three times. Caroline Marsh—THE Caroline Marsh who called my last piece "derivative drivel"—just wrote that my work is... [slowly] "breathtaking in its originality." [laugh] What? [pause] She used the word "masterful." About MY work. [bitter] Five years she's been tearing me apart in every single review. [frustrated] "Lacks depth," she'd say. "Uninspired choices." [mocking] "One wonders why they continue." [long pause] And now suddenly I'm, um... I'm genius material? [anxious] Maybe she mixed up the names. [quickly] That has to be it, right? She meant to review someone else and— [trailing off] no, she quoted specific passages... [gasp softly] Oh my god, she actually liked it. [shaky voice] All this time I've been trying to prove myself to her. [upset] Every rejection, every dismissive comment, I let it eat at me. [laugh hard] And now what? Now I'm supposed to just... celebrate? [very quietly] Part of me wants to frame this review. [bitter] Part of me wants to tell her exactly where she can stick it. [sigh] I don't even know how to feel about this. [relieved] Maybe that's okay. Maybe I don't owe her—or anyone—a reaction. [confidently] The work speaks for itself now.
