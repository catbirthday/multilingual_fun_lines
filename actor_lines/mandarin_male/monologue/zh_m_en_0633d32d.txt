=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [very quietly] She actually said it. Said the words out loud. "I can't do this anymore." And I'm just sitting here with my duffel bag half-packed for Dubai, thinking... hmm, when was the last time I was home for more than three days? [pause] Two months ago? Three? Jesus, I don't even—I honestly can't remember. [regretful] It's always been "just one more job," right? One more tower, one more bridge, one more... whatever pays the bills plus hazard pay. And yeah, the money's incredible, but what's the point if I'm, um... if I'm sending it home to an empty house? [bitter] She used to text me every morning. Every single morning. When did that stop? [sigh] I keep telling myself these jobs are important, that somebody has to hang off those cranes, somebody has to rig those platforms forty stories up, but... I mean, does it have to be me? [very sad] Does it always have to be me? The wedding photo's still on her nightstand, but my side of the bed doesn't even smell like me anymore. That's what she said. [crying while speaking] "You're a ghost who pays the mortgage." God. When did I become that guy?
