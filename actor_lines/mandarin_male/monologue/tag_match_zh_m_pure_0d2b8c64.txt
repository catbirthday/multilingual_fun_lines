=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [专注] 好，我这个...嗯...看这些Q3的报告，算算啊，差不多有六个小时了吧，然后...等等。哇塞。这个真的很有意思诶。[停顿] 两家公司都在烧钱—我是说，TechVision每个月要烧掉多少来着，800万？DataSync也好不到哪儿去。[加快语速] 但是你看这儿，就在并购文件里—他们的问题完全是反着来的！TechVision有基础设施但是没有产品线，DataSync呢，那个...他们有特别牛的IP但是完全没有销售渠道。[兴奋] 天哪，现在看起来太明显了！光是裁掉重复的部门就省了，我看看啊...一年4200万。[轻笑] 有意思的是，两边的董事会一开始都不想并购。他们都，怎么说呢，太要面子了，不愿意承认需要对方。[轻声] 但是企业发展部有个人—好像是Martinez吧—她基本上是逼着他们看清楚这个事实。把云服务合并了，销售团队也整合了... [越来越激动] 18个月之内，从快破产直接干到30亿估值。[停顿] 这种分析就是这样，对吧？有时候你不是在找增长机会。[非常真诚] 有时候你就是...怎么说呢，就是想办法让两艘快沉的船，别真的沉了。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [专注] Okay, so I've been digging through these Q3 reports for, mmm, probably six hours now and... wait. Oh wow. This is actually fascinating. [停顿] Both companies were hemorrhaging cash—I mean, TechVision was burning through what, eight million a month? And DataSync wasn't much better. [加快语速] But look at this, right here in the merger docs—they had completely opposite problems! TechVision had the infrastructure but no product pipeline, DataSync had, um... they had incredible IP but zero distribution channels. [兴奋] God, it's so obvious now! The redundancies they eliminated alone saved, let me see... forty-two million annually. [轻笑] And the funny thing is, neither board wanted this merger initially. They were both, you know, too proud to admit they needed each other. [轻声] But someone in corporate dev—I think it was Martinez—she basically forced them to see it. Combined their cloud services, merged the sales teams... [越来越激动] Within eighteen months they went from near bankruptcy to a three billion valuation. [停顿] That's the thing about these analyses, right? Sometimes you're not looking for growth opportunities. [非常真诚] Sometimes you're just trying to keep two sinking ships from, well... sinking.
