=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [轻声] 我刚收到email。[停顿] Martinez没能挺过来。[颤抖的声音] 他们说是在坎大哈外面的IED，就是我们以前一起巡逻的那条路。[叹气] 我现在坐在这儿，咖啡都凉了，还在担心那些破表格，而他却— [停顿] 老天，我都说不出口。[苦涩] 你知道最让人受不了的是什么吗？我今早还在抱怨堵车。堵车。[笑] 好像那算什么事儿似的。好像Martinez再也回不了家的时候，这些破事儿还有什么意义。[非常悲伤] 他老婆怀孕了。你知道吗？第三个孩子了。[停顿] 我应该在那儿的。[沮丧] 我知道这想法很蠢，我知道就算在也改变不了什么，但我应该跟他在一起的。[轻声] 我们说好要互相照应的。[颤抖的声音] 结果我在这儿，安安全全地坐在办公桌后面，而他... [停顿] 我都不知道该跟他家人说什么。能说什么呢？[非常小声] "对不起，我还活着他却没了"？[叹气] 我一直在想我们最后一次一起巡逻，他还在开玩笑说，嗯...说要回家给他儿子当棒球教练。[哭着说] 他特别期待那个。[停顿] 我得—我得给他老婆打电话。[非常小声] 我就是不知道怎么开口。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [轻声] I just got the email. [停顿] Martinez didn't make it. [颤抖的声音] They said it was an IED outside Kandahar, same route we used to patrol together. [叹气] I'm sitting here with my coffee getting cold, worried about spreadsheets, and he's— [停顿] God, I can't even say it. [苦涩] You know what the worst part is? I complained about traffic this morning. Traffic. [笑] Like that's a real problem. Like that matters at all when Martinez is never coming home. [非常悲伤] His wife is pregnant. Did you know that? Third kid. [停顿] I should've been there. [沮丧] I know that's stupid, I know I couldn't have changed anything, but I should've been there with him. [轻声] We promised we'd watch each other's backs. [颤抖的声音] And here I am, safe behind a desk, while he's... [停顿] I don't even know what to tell his family. What do you say? [非常小声] "Sorry I'm here and he's not"? [叹气] I keep thinking about that last patrol we did together, how he was joking about, um... about getting home to coach his son's baseball team. [哭着说] He was so excited about that. [停顿] I need to— I need to call his wife. [非常小声] I just don't know how.
