[pause] 简直可笑，对吧？[sarcastic] 那些晚上我留下来做inventory，希望他们能注意到我，they pick TODAY to finally notice. [upset] 就在我交了1500块不能退的钱之后。[groan]\n\n而且吧，嗯... 他提的薪水？[confused] 其实还挺不错的。真的，很不错。[quietly] 比我想象中他们会给我这个年纪的人的要多很多。Health insurance, two weeks vacation, the whole package. [hesitantly] 要是我就这么... 接受了，我爸肯定会松一口气。\n\n天啊，我真不知道。[anxious] 也许这是老天在暗示我什么？就是说，也许艺术学校只是——不对。[angry] 不，这太蠢了。[pause] 我从12岁就想要这个了。[very quietly] 但要是我真的很烂呢？[sigh] 要是我根本当不了艺术家，而我却在扔掉... [trailing off] this is exactly what everyone said would happen."

[frustrated] And now—now that I finally sent in my deposit to the art institute, now that I told my parents, now that I've been, like, mentally preparing myself to leave—now Mr. Davidson wants to talk about benefits and retirement plans? [laugh] \n\nI mean, the timing is just... [pause] it's almost funny, right? [sarcastic] All those nights I stayed late doing inventory, hoping they'd notice, and they pick TODAY. [upset] The day after I paid fifteen hundred dollars I can't get back. [groan]\n\nAnd the thing is, um... the salary he mentioned? [confused] It's actually decent. Like, really decent. [quietly] More than I thought they'd ever offer someone my age. Health insurance, two weeks vacation, the whole thing. [hesitantly] My dad would be so relieved if I just... took it.\n\nGod, I don't know. [anxious] Maybe this is the universe telling me something? Like, maybe art school is just—no. [angry] No, that's stupid. [pause] I've wanted this since I was twelve. [very quietly] But what if I'm terrible? [sigh] What if I can't actually make it as an artist and I'm throwing away...
