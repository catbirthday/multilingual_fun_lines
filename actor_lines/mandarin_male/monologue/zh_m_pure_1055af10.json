[pause] 我都不知道该跟他家人说什么。能说什么呢？[very quietly] \"对不起，我还活着他却没了\"？[sigh] 我一直在想我们最后一次一起巡逻，他还在开玩笑说，嗯...说要回家给他儿子当棒球教练。[crying while speaking] 他特别期待那个。[pause] 我得—我得给他老婆打电话。[very quietly] 我就是不知道怎么开口。"

[sigh] I'm sitting here with my coffee getting cold, worried about spreadsheets, and he's— [pause] God, I can't even say it. [bitter] You know what the worst part is? I complained about traffic this morning. Traffic. [laugh] Like that's a real problem. Like that matters at all when Martinez is never coming home. [very sad] His wife is pregnant. Did you know that? Third kid. [pause] I should've been there. [frustrated] I know that's stupid, I know I couldn't have changed anything, but I should've been there with him. [quietly] We promised we'd watch each other's backs. [shaky voice] And here I am, safe behind a desk, while he's... [pause] I don't even know what to tell his family. What do you say? [very quietly] \"Sorry I'm here and he's not\"? [sigh] I keep thinking about that last patrol we did together, how he was joking about, um... about getting home to coach his son's baseball team. [crying while speaking] He was so excited about that. [pause] I need to— I need to call his wife. [very quietly] I just don't know how."
