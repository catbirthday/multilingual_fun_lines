[pause] 然后他们就开始跟我敞开心扉了，这个，呃，完全出乎我的意料。有个孩子，他一直在惹麻烦，对吧？其他人就是不停地让他停课，罚他留堂，反正就是各种惩罚。[quietly] 但是当我跟他坐下来，真正地坐下来谈心的时候，我才意识到他家里的那些事情……真的是让人喘不过气来。所以我没有再罚他，we worked out this whole restorative justice approach，就是让他既能弥补过错，又能得到他需要的支持。[excited] 结果真的有效！就是，genuinely worked, you know? 现在大家都觉得我是那个真正能够触及这些孩子内心的人。[hesitantly] 这太诡异了，因为我本来应该是那个执行惩罚的人，你懂吗？但是显然我……在这方面还挺有天赋的？[warmly] 在帮助别人疗愈这件事上，instead of just making their pain worse. 我，居然是我。[sigh] 我觉得吧，sometimes you really do discover your gifts in the strangest places."

[chuckle] But then something weird happened. Instead of just, you know, handing out punishments, I started... actually listening to people. [pause] And they started opening up to me, which was, um, completely unexpected. This one kid, he'd been in trouble constantly, right? Everyone else just kept suspending him, adding detentions, whatever. [quietly] But when I sat down with him, really sat down, I realized he was dealing with stuff at home that was just... overwhelming. So instead of another punishment, we worked out this whole restorative thing where he could, uh, make amends but also get support. [excited] And it worked! Like, genuinely worked. Now I've got this reputation as the person who can actually reach these kids. [hesitantly] Which is bizarre because I'm supposed to be the punisher, you know? But apparently I'm... good at this? [warmly] At helping people heal instead of just making them hurt more. Me, of all people. [sigh] I guess sometimes you discover your gifts in the strangest places."
