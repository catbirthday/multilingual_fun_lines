[very quietly] \"We've been looking for you for twenty-three years.\" \n\n[crying while speaking] Twenty-three years. That's my whole life, that's— [sniffle] They didn't forget about me. I thought maybe, you know, I was just some... some mistake they wanted to move past, but they've been— [pause] God, they've been searching this whole time. [laugh] This is insane. \n\n[anxious] Okay so there's, uh, there's two sisters. I have sisters? [very excited] And they say our mother—our mother—she never stopped hoping. [shaky voice] She apparently checks these sites every week, every single week for over two decades, just... just hoping I'd show up. \n\n[hesitantly] What do I even say to that? Like, \"Hi, I'm the baby you, um, you gave up\"? [crying while speaking] No, wait, they didn't give me up, they—the message says there were circumstances. [sniffle] Legal complications or something. \n\n[relieved] They want to meet. [extremely happy] They actually want to meet me. All of them."
