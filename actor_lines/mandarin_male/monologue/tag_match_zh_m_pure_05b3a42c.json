[sigh] I'm not going to stand here and tell you you're wrong, because clearly something brought you to this. But pointless? [frustrated] That word is just hitting me hard right now. I mean, I get it, I really do. The system is broken in a lot of ways. Testing is ridiculous, half the curriculum feels outdated, and God knows I've had my own moments where I'm like, why am I even teaching this? [pause] But here's what I keep coming back to—it's not about the algebra or the essay structure or whatever. [empathetically] It's about figuring out how your brain works, you know? Learning how to, um... how to push through when something's hard. How to find your voice. [quietly] And maybe I'm being selfish here, but I see so much in you. The way you think about things, the questions you ask even when you're pretending not to care. That's not pointless. That's, uh... that's everything actually. [hesitantly] Look, I can't make this decision for you. But before you walk away from all of this, just— can we talk about what pointless really means to you? Because maybe we can find a different path that doesn't feel so... empty. [very sincerely] You matter too much for me to just let you disappear without trying."
