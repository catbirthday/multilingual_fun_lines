[relieved] 召回令通过了。[laugh] 我都不知道该— [clearing throat] 不好意思，我就是... 嗯，我也不知道自己以为会是什么感觉？[emotional] 我女儿下个月就... 就该23岁了。[pause] 现在因为这个，成千上万的家庭不用再经历我们— [cry] 天啊，对不起。[sniffle] 就是突然一下子涌上来了，你懂吗？那些听证会上，他们基本上就是说我歇斯底里。[bitter] \"悲伤的母亲无法接受现实。\" [pause] 结果呢，现实是11000个有缺陷的产品，可能会要人命的... [trailing off] 我是说，这数字简直... [overwhelmed] 而且他们知道的。[angry] Emma死之前两年他们就知道了，但是他们什么都没做，因为这要花他们— [voice breaking] 多少来着，1200万？[laugh bitterly] 1200万块钱，跟多少条人命比？[exhausted] 我真的好累。但同时又... 莫名其妙地亢奋？[confused] 这正常吗？同时感受到所有情绪？[quietly] 不过她会为我骄傲的。[warm] Emma总说我固执得要命。[chuckle] 看来她说对了。"

[laugh] I can't even— [clearing throat] Sorry, I'm just... hmm, I don't know what I expected to feel? [emotional] My daughter would've been twenty-three next month. [pause] And now, because of this, thousands of families won't have to go through what we— [cry] God, I'm sorry. [sniffle] It's just hitting me, you know? All those depositions where they basically called me hysterical. [bitter] \"Grieving mother can't accept reality.\" [pause] Well, turns out reality was eleven thousand defective units that could've killed... [trailing off] I mean, the numbers are just... [overwhelmed] And they knew. [angry] They knew for two years before Emma died and they did nothing because it would've cost them— [voice breaking] what was it, twelve million? [laugh bitterly] Twelve million dollars versus how many lives? [exhausted] I'm so tired. But also, like... weirdly energized? [confused] Is that normal? To feel everything at once? [quietly] She'd be proud though. [warm] Emma always said I was too stubborn for my own good. [chuckle] Guess she was right about that."
