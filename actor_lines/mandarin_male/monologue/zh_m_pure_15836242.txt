=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: 好，Tommy，看看我怎么握球的？你要摸摸这些孔——对对对，就是这样。[warm] 手指就放这儿，完美。等会儿钻孔的时候呢，会有那种声音，怎么说呢……就像那种特别响的卷笔刀，知道吧？[cheerful] 别担心，就是这个声音，很正常的。哎呦，你看你，自己都会量了！看吧，我就知道你行的。[excited] Marcus那边，他都做第3个球了——Marcus，教教Tommy怎么量指距，好吗！

其实吧，嗯，这些孩子刚来的时候都特别没底。[empathetically] 他们爸妈跟我说，从来没人让他们碰过真正的工具，对吧？但是你把电钻递到他们手里……我是说，真的太不可思议了。[passionately] 他们真的在做属于自己的东西，自己量的，自己做出来的。等他们拿着这个球去打保龄球的时候？天哪，那表情。

[sniffle] 不好意思，我就是—Tommy妈妈跟我说他已经……那个……好几个月都不愿意尝试新东西了。[very sincerely] 但你看看他现在，在教别的孩子用游标卡尺呢。这才是重点，你懂吧？不是保龄球本身。是看着他们意识到自己能做到难的事情。[happy] 他们真的能做到很难很难的事情。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: Okay Tommy, see how I'm holding the ball? You want to feel for these holes—yeah, exactly like that. [warm] Your fingers go right there, perfect. Now when we drill, it's gonna make this sound, kind of like... like a really loud pencil sharpener, you know? [cheerful] Don't worry, it's supposed to sound like that. Oh wow, look at you measuring it yourself! See, I knew you could do it. [excited] Marcus over there, he's already on his third ball—show Tommy how you check the span, buddy!

The thing is, um, these kids come in here and they're so unsure at first. [empathetically] Their parents tell me nobody ever lets them use the real tools, right? But then you put that drill in their hands and... I mean, it's incredible. [passionately] They're actually making something that's theirs, something they measured, something they created. And when they bowl with it later? Man, the look on their faces.

[sniffle] Sorry, I just—Tommy's mom told me he hasn't, er... he hasn't wanted to try anything new in months. [very sincerely] But look at him now, teaching the other kids how to use the calipers. That's what this is really about, you know? Not the bowling balls. It's seeing them realize they can do hard things. [happy] They can do really hard things.
