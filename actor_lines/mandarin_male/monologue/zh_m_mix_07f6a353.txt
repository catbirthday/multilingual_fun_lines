=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [exhausted] 三年了。整整三年的证词、动议、上诉，还有— [pause] 我们居然真的做到了。[laugh] 我一直在看判决书，但还是觉得不太真实。法官说了"先例"这个词。她真的用了"precedent"这个词。[passionately] 你知道这意味着什么吗？每一个被那些仲裁条款堵住嘴的人，他们终于— [voice breaking] 他们终于可以上法庭了。[sniffle] 对不起，我本来跟自己说不要哭的，但是... [pause] Sarah今天早上给我打电话了。还记得Sarah吗？就是互助小组里的那个？她在电话里哭得稀里哗啦的。不过是开心的眼泪。她说，呃，她说她现在终于可以立案了。Because of what we did. [relieved] 天啊，我当时真的好怕会输。最后那次上诉，我真的以为— 我真的以为我们完了。[quietly] 但我们没有。[smiling speaking] 几千人。That's what the advocacy groups are saying. 几千个之前得不到公正的受害者。[long pause] 我应该去睡觉了。我已经，呃... 我都不记得了。几个星期？[chuckle] 但我停不下来，一直在想那些人明天醒来会有昨天还没有的希望。[warm] 我们改变了一些东西。We actually changed something.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [exhausted] Three years. Three years of depositions and motions and appeals and— [pause] and we actually did it. [laugh] I keep reading the verdict and it doesn't feel real yet. The judge said "precedent." She actually used that word. [passionately] Do you understand what that means? Every single person who's been silenced by those arbitration clauses, they can finally— [voice breaking] they can finally have their day in court. [sniffle] Sorry, I told myself I wouldn't cry but... [pause] Sarah called me this morning. Remember Sarah? From the support group? She was sobbing. Happy tears though. She said, um, she said she can finally file her case now. Because of what we did. [relieved] God, I was so scared we'd lose. That last appeal, I thought— I really thought we were done. [quietly] But we weren't. [smiling speaking] Thousands of people. That's what the advocacy groups are saying. Thousands of victims who couldn't get justice before. [long pause] I should probably sleep. I haven't slept properly in, uh... I don't even know. Weeks? [chuckle] But I can't stop thinking about all those people waking up tomorrow with hope they didn't have yesterday. [warm] We changed something. We actually changed something.
