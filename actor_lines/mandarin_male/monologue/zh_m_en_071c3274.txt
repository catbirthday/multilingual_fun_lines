Subject: The stonemason project you spent three years on is being demolished for a parking lot

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [very quietly] Three years. [pause] I keep thinking about that first stone, you know? How I... hmm, how I held it in my hands for like twenty minutes before I even started carving. [bitter] And now they're gonna tear it down for a parking lot. [laugh] A parking lot! Can you believe that? [sigh] 

[angry] I mean, what am I supposed to— [trailing off] Sorry, I just... [very sad] Every single piece was hand-selected. Every curve, every joint, I... I obsessed over them. Late nights in the workshop, my back killing me, dust in my lungs, and I kept thinking, "This is it, this is my legacy," you know? [sarcastic] But hey, at least people will have somewhere convenient to park their SUVs.

[whispering] My daughter drew me a picture of it last week. [pause] Put it on the fridge. "Daddy's wall," she called it. [shaky voice] How do I tell her it's... [sigh] I don't know, maybe it was always meant to be temporary. Nothing lasts, right? [very melancholic] All that limestone, all those perfect mortar joints, they'll just be rubble by Friday. [long pause] Three years of my life, and by Friday it'll be like it never existed.
