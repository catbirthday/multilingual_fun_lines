# Speaker Lines Only (Translated) - Latin American Spanish (Male)
============================================================

1. She's been at every single rehearsal for, [trembling], twelve years and the actors won't even know how to, [shaky voice], warm up without her there. [pause]
2. [bitter] I keep thinking if we'd caught it sooner or, [frustrated], tried a different vet or maybe, [anxious], changed her diet years ago, we wouldn't be, [slowly], here right now.
3. [whispering] The understudies named their dressing room after her and painted, [crying while speaking], her portrait on the wall last season when she started, [trailing off], slowing down...
4. [monotone] I know. [long pause]
5. The whole cast wanted to be here but I thought that would be, [exhausted], too overwhelming for her final moments. [sniffle]
6. [regretful] Every opening night she'd sit in the wings wearing her little bandana and, [muted], somehow she always knew when someone, [nervously], forgot a line because she'd wag her tail to encourage them.
7. [apologetic] I keep delaying because once she's gone the theater will feel, [hollow], like we've lost our soul and, um, I don't know how to, [confused], direct a company through that kind of grief, you know. [gasp softly]
8. [formal] She performed her final role last week even though she could, [proudly], barely walk, making it all the way across, [emotional], the stage during curtain call one last time.
9. Well, um, the prop master saved her favorite tennis ball from, er, our very first production together and, umm, I brought it so she could have it with her.
10. [determined] She deserves to exit with the same dignity she brought to every, [grateful], single performance so let's give her the peaceful finale that, [whispering loudly], honors everything she's meant to all of us.
11. Three months. I sent those reports three months ago. [gasp softly] Oh my God, Marcus is in the ICU because they didn't—they didn't even read them. I flagged that exact machine, the die temperature controls, I said someone was going to get hurt if we didn't fix the—[shaky voice] His hand is just... gone. Like, they had to amputate and I'm sitting here with my email chain showing I warned them eight times. Eight! 

[furious] How do you just ignore safety reports? I mean, what's the point of having a safety engineer if nobody listens? [frustrated] I literally wrote "URGENT: Risk of Catastrophic Failure" in the subject line. I CC'd everyone—the floor manager, the plant director, um, even corporate. 

[crying while speaking] Marcus has three kids. Three little kids and now he can't—he won't be able to work the floor anymore, won't be able to... [pause] I should've done more. Should've walked down there myself and shut the line down. [regretful] But I thought sending it up the chain was enough, you know? I thought documentation would protect people.

[very quietly] They're calling it an accident. An accident. [bitter] It wasn't an accident when you have a paper trail saying exactly what would happen. Actually, I don't even—[anxious] what if they try to bury this? What if they blame Marcus somehow? [upset] I can't let them do that. I have everything saved, every email, every timestamp.
12. [confused] This can't be right. I'm looking at the statement and it says—it says zero? [shaky voice] That's not possible, there's supposed to be eight hundred thousand dollars in here. Um, maybe it's a system error or... [anxious] Let me refresh this. [pause] Still zero. Oh God. [gasp] The transfers, all these transfers I never authorized, they're all to accounts in the Caymans. 

[upset] Richard did this. Richard, who I've known for fifteen years, [furious] who came to my daughter's wedding! I trusted him with everything—my whole future, actually, and he just... [groan] How could I be so stupid? [angry] Thirty-seven years I saved for this! Thirty-seven years of overtime, of skipping vacations, of driving that piece of shit Honda because I was being "responsible." 

[cry] I'm seventy-one years old. What am I supposed to—I can't start over. [very sad] Margaret's gonna have to know we can't help with her mortgage anymore. The grandkids' college funds, basically everything we promised... [bitter] And Richard's probably on some beach right now with my money. [shaky voice] With our money. 

[exhausted] I need to call the FBI or, I don't know, somebody. [sigh] But even if they catch him, the money's probably gone forever, isn't it? [very quietly] It's all gone.
13. [proud] So I just got the email from HR, and honestly, Sarah is absolutely crushing it. Like, [chuckle] I mean, I knew she was smart when we started the training, but this is—wow. [pause] You know, when they first told me I was being promoted and needed to train my replacement, I was kind of, [hesitantly] well, worried? Because the benefits admin role is actually way more complex than people realize, right? All those compliance deadlines, the open enrollment chaos, and oh God, [groan] the spreadsheets. But anyway, um, Sarah just took everything I showed her and somehow made it even better. [impressed] Her first quarter numbers are literally twenty percent above what I ever managed. [short pause] And here's the thing—I'm not even [bitter] jealous or anything. Actually, no, that's not true. [laugh] Maybe a tiny bit? But mostly I'm just, [warm] I don't know, it feels really good? Like, er, knowing that the training materials I created, all those late nights documenting processes—[relieved] it actually mattered. HR just asked if I could develop training programs for other departments now. [excited] Which is basically validation that I'm not just good at my job, but I can actually teach others to be even better. [sigh] That's pretty cool, I guess.
