Speaker [en]: [proud] So I just got the email from HR, and honestly, Sarah is absolutely crushing it. Like, [chuckle] I mean, I knew she was smart when we started the training, but this is—wow. [pause] You know, when they first told me I was being promoted and needed to train my replacement, I was kind of, [hesitantly] well, worried? Because the benefits admin role is actually way more complex than people realize, right? All those compliance deadlines, the open enrollment chaos, and oh God, [groan] the spreadsheets. But anyway, um, Sarah just took everything I showed her and somehow made it even better. [impressed] Her first quarter numbers are literally twenty percent above what I ever managed. [short pause] And here's the thing—I'm not even [bitter] jealous or anything. Actually, no, that's not true. [laugh] Maybe a tiny bit? But mostly I'm just, [warm] I don't know, it feels really good? Like, er, knowing that the training materials I created, all those late nights documenting processes—[relieved] it actually mattered. HR just asked if I could develop training programs for other departments now. [excited] Which is basically validation that I'm not just good at my job, but I can actually teach others to be even better. [sigh] That's pretty cool, I guess.
