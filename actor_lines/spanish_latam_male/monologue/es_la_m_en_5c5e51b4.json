[chuckle] They're all calling me \"boss\" now—even Marcus, who started the same week I did. [pause] He used to call me buddy. Haven't heard that in, what, two years? Three? [slowly] We used to grab beers every Friday. Him, Janet, Paulo, the whole crew. Now they just... nod at me in the hallway. [bitter] Very professionally. [long pause] I checked my phone earlier. No texts except work stuff. Remember when we had that group chat? The stupid one with all the memes? [sad] It's been dead for months. I think they have a new one without me. Saw them laughing at something on Janet's phone yesterday, and when I walked over, they all just... stopped. [quietly] \"Good morning, boss.\" That's what she said. [sigh] I make three times what I used to. I have the title I've been chasing since I was twenty-five. And I'm eating lunch alone at my desk again, looking at this incredible view, wondering if it was, um... if it was worth it. [very melancholic] All those people I stepped on to get here—they were my friends once."
