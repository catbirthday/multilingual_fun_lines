[angry] Oh my god, this is why they've been so weird with me. This is why Dad barely talks to me anymore. [shaky voice] All those times Derek would pat me on the back and say we're brothers now, that we should stick together— [laugh] what a joke. [furious] Years. He's been doing this for years. Every little comment, every, um, every twisted story he fed them about me. [hurt] And they believed him. [pause] They just believed him without even asking me. [sarcastic] Perfect stepson Derek, right? Always so helpful, always so concerned about the family. [very sad] I actually tried so hard to make this work. I wanted them to like me. [bitter] But he was sabotaging me the whole time, making me look ungrateful, making me look like the problem child. [long pause] You know what? [coldly] Two can play that game. He wants to be the golden boy? Fine. But I'm done pretending we're family."
