Speaker [en]: [confused] This can't be right. I'm looking at the statement and it says—it says zero? [shaky voice] That's not possible, there's supposed to be eight hundred thousand dollars in here. Um, maybe it's a system error or... [anxious] Let me refresh this. [pause] Still zero. Oh God. [gasp] The transfers, all these transfers I never authorized, they're all to accounts in the Caymans. 

[upset] Richard did this. Richard, who I've known for fifteen years, [furious] who came to my daughter's wedding! I trusted him with everything—my whole future, actually, and he just... [groan] How could I be so stupid? [angry] Thirty-seven years I saved for this! Thirty-seven years of overtime, of skipping vacations, of driving that piece of shit Honda because I was being "responsible." 

[cry] I'm seventy-one years old. What am I supposed to—I can't start over. [very sad] Margaret's gonna have to know we can't help with her mortgage anymore. The grandkids' college funds, basically everything we promised... [bitter] And Richard's probably on some beach right now with my money. [shaky voice] With our money. 

[exhausted] I need to call the FBI or, I don't know, somebody. [sigh] But even if they catch him, the money's probably gone forever, isn't it? [very quietly] It's all gone.
