Speaker [en]: Three months. I sent those reports three months ago. [gasp softly] Oh my God, Marcus is in the ICU because they didn't—they didn't even read them. I flagged that exact machine, the die temperature controls, I said someone was going to get hurt if we didn't fix the—[shaky voice] His hand is just... gone. Like, they had to amputate and I'm sitting here with my email chain showing I warned them eight times. Eight! 

[furious] How do you just ignore safety reports? I mean, what's the point of having a safety engineer if nobody listens? [frustrated] I literally wrote "URGENT: Risk of Catastrophic Failure" in the subject line. I CC'd everyone—the floor manager, the plant director, um, even corporate. 

[crying while speaking] Marcus has three kids. Three little kids and now he can't—he won't be able to work the floor anymore, won't be able to... [pause] I should've done more. Should've walked down there myself and shut the line down. [regretful] But I thought sending it up the chain was enough, you know? I thought documentation would protect people.

[very quietly] They're calling it an accident. An accident. [bitter] It wasn't an accident when you have a paper trail saying exactly what would happen. Actually, I don't even—[anxious] what if they try to bury this? What if they blame Marcus somehow? [upset] I can't let them do that. I have everything saved, every email, every timestamp.
