Same principle really, you just... you look for who's not talking to who, which departments don't cross-check, where the oversight gets thin. [pause] Called in some old contacts who, uh, who know how cargo manifests work. [chuckle] Turns out humanitarian aid moves a lot like contraband if you know what you're doing. [passionately] And these bureaucrats sitting in their air-conditioned offices have no idea we just moved twelve tons of antibiotics through their \"secure\" channels! [long pause] Yesterday this volunteer, she grabbed my hands and just... she was crying because we got insulin through for her daughter. [emotional] That's when it hit me—all those years running from the law, maybe I was just, um, training for this. [determined] Tomorrow we're getting water purifiers through. They can try to stop us with their forms and protocols, but people need help now."
