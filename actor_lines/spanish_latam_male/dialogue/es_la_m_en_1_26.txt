Character 1 [en]: Hey, you were in that basketball movie last month, right?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, that was me—spent, uh, three weeks pretending to be a rabid fan in the stands. Pretty exhausting actually, all that fake cheering, but the craft services were incredible, so, you know, worth it I guess.

Character 1 [en]: Did you get any of those NIL deals people keep talking about?

Character 2 [en]: Ha! God no, that's... mmm, that's for the actual athletes, not us background folks. We're basically human furniture—they pay us minimum wage to fill space while the real talent gets those sweet endorsement contracts.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, so extras can't get NIL deals at all?

Character 2 [en]: Well, technically nothing's stopping us from trying, but, like, who's gonna sponsor Random Guy Number Three in the bleachers? The whole NIL thing is about marketability, and, uh, we're literally instructed to be as forgettable as possible.

Character 1 [en]: That seems unfair though.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Oh it's completely unfair—I mean, we're still using our image and likeness, right? But apparently our images aren't, um, valuable enough unless we're catching touchdowns or whatever. Meanwhile we're out there twelve hours in the heat.

Character 1 [en]: Have you tried negotiating for more?

Character 2 [en]: Negotiate? That's... wow, that's adorable. You clearly haven't worked as an extra before—we're so replaceable they literally have, like, hundreds of people on standby lists just waiting to take our spots if we so much as sneeze wrong.

Character 1 [en]: But what if extras organized together?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Look, some of us have tried that before and it never, ever ends well. The production companies just blacklist troublemakers and move on—there's always someone desperate enough to take seventy bucks to stand around all day, trust me.

Character 1 [en]: Seventy bucks? That's it?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, if you're lucky! Sometimes it's, uh, even less depending on the production. And don't even get me started on the whole "featured extra" scam where they promise you'll be visible but then, hmm, mysteriously you end up blurred in the background anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [sneeze] Sorry. So you've given up on NIL completely?

Character 2 [en]: [furious] Given up? I never even had a shot! These college kids are making millions just for existing on a field while I'm—while I'm eating cold bagels at four AM hoping maybe my elbow makes it into frame! The whole system is rigged against people like us!

Character 1 [en]: Jeez, I didn't mean to upset you.

Character 2 [en]: No, I'm... sorry, it's just really frustrating, you know? Like, we're part of making these productions work too, but somehow we're invisible when it comes to, uh, actually benefiting from our own image being used.

Character 1 [en]: Do you still enjoy doing it though?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? Yeah, sometimes—when you're on set with actual professionals and seeing how movies get made, it's, like, genuinely magical. I just wish that magic came with, I don't know, basic respect and maybe enough money to pay rent.
