=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I've done this procedure, [quietly], hundreds of times but it never gets easier when the animal has meant, [empathetically], this much to so many people in your community.

Character 2 [en]: She's been at every single rehearsal for, [trembling], twelve years and the actors won't even know how to, [shaky voice], warm up without her there. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: The cancer has spread to her lungs and while medication could, [hesitantly], buy maybe another week, she'd be in significant pain the, [very quietly], entire time. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] I keep thinking if we'd caught it sooner or, [frustrated], tried a different vet or maybe, [anxious], changed her diet years ago, we wouldn't be, [slowly], here right now.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I mean, you gave her an extraordinary life and, [gently], she's lived longer than most dogs her breed because of the love and, umm, care you all provided.

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] The understudies named their dressing room after her and painted, [crying while speaking], her portrait on the wall last season when she started, [trailing off], slowing down...

Character 1 [en]: She knows you're here.

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] I know. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, I mean, okay.

Character 2 [en]: The whole cast wanted to be here but I thought that would be, [exhausted], too overwhelming for her final moments. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] That was the right decision because keeping her calm and, [comfortable], peaceful is what matters most now. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Every opening night she'd sit in the wings wearing her little bandana and, [muted], somehow she always knew when someone, [nervously], forgot a line because she'd wag her tail to encourage them.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Well, um, I've prepared everything so that when you're ready, er, we can make sure she feels, [protected], nothing but your love as she, you know, drifts off to sleep.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I keep delaying because once she's gone the theater will feel, [hollow], like we've lost our soul and, um, I don't know how to, [confused], direct a company through that kind of grief, you know. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: The fact that you're worried about everyone else while facing, [compassionate], your own loss shows exactly why she was so devoted to you and, [steady], why your company trusts you to guide them, [carefully], through this.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] She performed her final role last week even though she could, [proudly], barely walk, making it all the way across, [emotional], the stage during curtain call one last time.

Character 1 [en]: Some animals seem to know when their work is complete and they hold on, [knowingly], just long enough to say goodbye in their, [tenderly], own way.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, the prop master saved her favorite tennis ball from, er, our very first production together and, umm, I brought it so she could have it with her.

Character 1 [en]: [reassuring] Of course she can have it with her and we'll take, [respectful], all the time you need to say goodbye before, [very sincerely], we begin the procedure. [deep breath]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] She deserves to exit with the same dignity she brought to every, [grateful], single performance so let's give her the peaceful finale that, [whispering loudly], honors everything she's meant to all of us.
