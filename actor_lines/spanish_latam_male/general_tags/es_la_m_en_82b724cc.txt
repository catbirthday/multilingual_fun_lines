=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [soft] I saw the article about the greenhouse winning that, [hesitant], sustainability award and thought maybe I should finally, [uncertain], come see what you've done with our, [trailing off], with the place.

Character 2 [en]: [guarded] Oh, well, um, it's been what, like, six years since you walked away from all this to, [careful], chase bigger causes in the city, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] That's not exactly, um, how I remember it happening, I mean, you're the one who, [hurt], said my ideas were too radical for this, [bitter], small community to handle, you know.

Character 2 [en]: The community needed something, [practical], they could actually use, not another protest site, well, not another battleground for your political statements, anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] So, um, I guess you got everything you wanted then, I mean, the greenhouse running exactly, [measured], how you envisioned it without my, [swallowing], complications getting in the way, right? [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [strained] It wasn't about getting what I, well, wanted, it was about, um, keeping this place alive when you left, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] You make it sound like I, [voice breaking], abandoned you when really you pushed me out because my vision for community organizing, [angry], didn't match your safe little plans.

Character 2 [en]: Your vision involved turning this into a, [exasperated], political statement instead of actually growing food for people who needed it.

Character 1 [en]: [wounded] Growing food is political when, um, half the neighborhood can't afford groceries, [passionate], but you never wanted to acknowledge that. [pauses]

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Maybe I just wanted to, um, help people without making everything into, well, a fight, you know.

Character 1 [en]: Everything worth doing involves, um, some kind of fight, I mean, that's what you never, [sad], understood about changing things, well, really changing them.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] I know, um.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] The new youth program you started, it's using, [realizing], my old curriculum design from when we first planned this place together.

Character 2 [en]: [caught] Well, um, some of your ideas were, [embarrassed], actually pretty good once I figured out how to implement them, you know. [laughs nervously]

Character 1 [en]: Why didn't you ever, um, tell me you were using them, I mean, [confused], I would have helped you adapt them.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Because admitting you were right about some things meant, [struggling], admitting I was wrong about pushing you away.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] We were both trying to save the world in our own ways.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] I just, um, I wanted to save it with you, well, not against you, but somehow we ended up on, [voice cracking], opposite sides of everything that mattered to us, [crying softly], both. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, me too.

Character 2 [en]: So, um, maybe we could try again, I mean, differently this time with both our approaches working, [hopeful], together instead of competing for the same, [careful], space in this community we both love, well, if you wanted that, [vulnerable], anyway.
