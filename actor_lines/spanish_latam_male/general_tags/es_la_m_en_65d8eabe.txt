=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] I suppose you heard from Dr. Martinez that this is my last regular appointment, since I'm transitioning to hospice care next week.

Character 2 [en]: [carefully measured] I did see the note in your file this morning, Mrs. Chen, and I've been trying to figure out what to say since you walked in.

Character 1 [en]: [wistful] Twenty-three weeks we've done this dance, you and I, same chair, same tourniquet, same careful search for a good vein in these tired old arms.

Character 2 [en]: Your veins have always been cooperative, actually better than most patients half your age, [exhales], which makes this feel even more unfair somehow.

Character 1 [en]: [drained] Unfair is watching your body become a stranger, watching it withdraw from you piece by piece while your mind stays perfectly clear to witness every betrayal.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Would you like me to use the butterfly needle today, the smaller one, since we don't need as many vials this time?

Character 1 [en]: [hollow laugh] Always so accommodating, trying to make things easier even when we both know nothing about this is easy anymore, is it?

Character 2 [en]: Nothing about this job is easy when you care about the people in these chairs.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] You know, my daughter thinks I'm crazy for looking forward to these appointments, but you've become part of my routine, part of what's kept me anchored.

Character 2 [en]: The Tuesday morning crowd won't be the same without you asking about everyone's grandchildren and remembering all their names. [voice catching slightly]

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Don't you dare cry on me now, not when I need you steady.

Character 2 [en]: [composing self] You're right, I'm sorry, let me just get this tourniquet positioned and we'll make this last draw count.

Character 1 [en]: I've been withdrawing from so many things lately, selling the house, giving away books, but I couldn't bring myself to cancel this appointment.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Some connections matter more than others, and honestly, you've taught me more about dignity than any training ever could.

Character 1 [en]: Dignity is just stubbornness dressed up in nice clothes, dear, but I appreciate you saying it anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] There's that wit I'm going to miss, always deflecting the heavy moments with humor even when your eyes tell a different story.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] My eyes are tired too, tired of watching this slow drain, tired of pretending there's hope where there isn't any. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: All done with the draw, just hold this gauze for me, and Mrs. Chen, would you mind if I walked you out to the lobby today?

Character 1 [en]: [touched] That would be lovely, though I warn you I'm moving even slower than last week, if you can believe that's possible.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] We'll take all the time you need, and thank you for letting me be part of this journey, even just this small medical part of it. [pause] It's meant something.
