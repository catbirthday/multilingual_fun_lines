=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Let me see here... I need. My contract details. Now.

Customer Support [en]: Oh yeah, contracts, uh, they make these things so confusing on purpose, I swear. So let me pull up your account real quick—what's your phone number?

Customer [en]: Five five five. Eight seven. Two nine.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, got it, so I'm looking at your account here and, hmm, you're on our Premium Plus plan from March 2023, which means you've got about, er, 4 months left until March 2025.

Customer [en]: Four months? That can't be— What's the word... The penalty. For leaving.

Customer Support [en]: Right, yeah, the early termination fee—honestly it's kind of ridiculous how much they charge. So basically if you cancel now, um, it'd be $180 times your remaining months, which comes out to $720 total.

Customer [en]: Seven hundred. Do you know who I am? VP at Morrison Tech.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, Morrison Tech, that's, uh—actually let me check something here. Sometimes we have corporate exemptions that, er, might apply to your situation, especially with enterprise-level clients.

Customer [en]: And then you would just... Are you sure? Seven twenty?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah unfortunately that's what the system shows, but hold on, I'm actually pretty new here so, um, let me dig into this a bit more—there might be options we could explore like, uh, converting to a month-to-month at $89.99 instead.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if... Okay so that means. No penalty?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly! So if we switch you over today, er, there's zero termination fee, and honestly between you and me, it's basically the same service level you're getting now, just without the 24-month commitment lock-in.

Customer [en]: Morrison has contracts. With your company. Millions. Check that.

Customer Support [en]: Oh geez, you're absolutely right—I'm pulling up our B2B portal now and, uh, yep, Morrison Tech has an enterprise agreement as of July 2024 for, wow, $2.3 million annually, so that definitely changes things here.

Customer [en]: So. What now? If that makes sense, I mean...

Customer Support [en]: Alright so, hmm, with that enterprise connection you actually qualify for our VIP transition program, which basically waives all early termination fees and, er, lets you move to any plan immediately, code VIP-8827-EXEMPT.

Customer [en]: Wait. VIP? Are you sure? That would actually...

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely, I mean, I probably should've checked this first but, uh, yeah, anyone tied to an enterprise account over $1 million gets automatic VIP status—it went into effect January 1st this year actually.

Customer [en]: Thank God. Okay so. When does this... Process it. Today.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so I'm processing that right now, and, er, you'll get a confirmation email to your address on file within, hmm, about 15 minutes, reference number TRX-9982-VIP, and your new terms start immediately at 12:01 AM tonight!
