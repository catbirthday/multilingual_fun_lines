Customer [en]: Good afternoon. I'm calling about order... what's the word... requisition? Purchase order ED-7742.

Customer Support [en]: Oh hi there! Let me pull that right up for you, just a sec... hmm, okay so I'm seeing ED-7742-XK9 here in our system, looks like it's for athletic equipment? Forty-seven uniforms and, uh, some training gear, is that right?

Customer [en]: Correct. *exhales* This is the fourth call about this order.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, the fourth? I'm so sorry you've had to call that many times, that's... let me look at the notes here. Okay so I can see there were calls on the 12th, 15th, and, um, yesterday the 18th, and it looks like each rep gave you different information which is, I mean...

Customer [en]: Yes. Each person has been... how do I put this... creative with their explanations.

Customer Support [en]: *sharp inhale* Yeah I can imagine how frustrating that must be. So looking at tracking number TRK-892-KLMN-47, I think I see what might've happened here—the shipment got rerouted through facility DC-4 instead of DC-2, which probably explains why everyone's been seeing different...

Customer [en]: *sigh* Look, I know this isn't your fault personally.

Customer Support [en]: I really appreciate you saying that, honestly. Okay so here's what I'm gonna do, um, I'm escalating this to our expedited team right now with priority code EXP-URGENT-923, and they'll have it moving within, er, usually about two hours?

Customer [en]: Two hours. After waiting... what's it been... twelve days already?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, I know.

Customer [en]: Our season starts Monday. That's three days from now.

Customer Support [en]: Oh shoot, okay that changes things. Let me, hmm... actually you know what? I'm putting in an override—reference number OVR-4429-STAT—to get this on tomorrow's early delivery, arrival by 10:30 AM your time, and I'm waiving all expedited fees, obviously.

Customer [en]: *exhales slowly* That would be... acceptable. If it actually happens.

Customer Support [en]: It will, I promise. I'm personally flagging this with case ID CSE-ATHLETIC-7742-P1, which means it'll ping my dashboard if anything changes, and I can give you my direct extension if you'd like? It's 4782.

Customer [en]: Yes. Please. Because the last three reps mysteriously couldn't provide that.

Customer Support [en]: Ugh, I'm sorry, that's... anyway, yes, extension 4782, my name's Jordan, and honestly if there's any hiccup at all, even a tiny delay, I'll personally call you by, let's say noon tomorrow?

Customer [en]: I appreciate that. This whole... what do you call it... procurement process has been absurd.

Customer Support [en]: No you're absolutely right, it shouldn't be this hard. Oh actually, one more thing—I'm adding a credit of $247.50 to your account for the inconvenience, transaction ID TXN-892KLM, should process within...

Customer [en]: That's very kind. *softer* Thank you for actually listening.

Customer Support [en]: Of course! And hey, I mean, I played volleyball in college so I totally get how stressful pre-season is. Your confirmation number for everything we discussed today is CNF-7742-RESOLVE, and er, yeah, I'll make sure those uniforms get there.
