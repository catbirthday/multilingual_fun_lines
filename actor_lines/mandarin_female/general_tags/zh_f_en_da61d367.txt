=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Hello? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [professional] Mr. Hernandez, my name is Sofia Martinez and I'm, [careful], calling from Apex Executive Search about a, [hesitant], position that might interest you based on your, [measured], extensive agricultural management experience.

Character 1 [en]: I think you have the, [confused], wrong person because I, um, just work the fields and, well, I don't know anything about, [nervous], executive nothing. [laughs nervously]

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] Papa?

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Sofia, my God, how did you, [breaking], find me after all these years when I couldn't even, [voice cracking], find the courage to find you?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Well, um, it wasn't that hard when you've been using the same, [cold], social security number at every farm from California to, [sharp], Washington for twenty years, I mean, leaving a trail anyone could, um, follow if they really wanted to.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] You became successful.

Character 2 [en]: [controlled] I became what I had to become when my, [struggling], father disappeared one morning leaving only a note saying he'd, [hollow], send money that never came for, [breaking], sixteen years.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Every penny I could save went back but your mother, [ashamed], she sent it all back unopened. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [angry] She died eight years ago still, [shaking], waiting for you to walk through that door with your, [bitter], promises of a better life. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: The border patrol caught me, [defeated], three times trying to get back, um, and after the third deportation they said, well, if I tried again it would be, umm, ten years in prison. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: [softer] I hired a private investigator six months ago to, [careful], track you down because I needed to, [struggling], hear your voice say my name just, [trembling], once before I got married next spring. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Sofia, mi amor, my little Sofia who used to, um, dance on my feet while I hummed your mother's favorite, [nostalgic], songs in our kitchen that, well, smelled like fresh tortillas every, umm, Sunday morning.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] Don't do that, don't you, [angry], dare make me remember the father who taught me to, [breaking], be brave when all you did was teach me how to, [bitter], survive abandonment.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Let me see you just once, even from, [desperate], across a restaurant where you don't have to speak to me or, [begging], acknowledge that this broken fieldworker is your father. [sobs quietly]

Character 2 [en]: The position I called about was, [steady], never real but this headhunting company I built from, [proud], nothing does have an office in Fresno where I'll be next, [uncertain], Thursday at noon.

Character 1 [en]: That's ninety miles from here but I'll, [determined], walk if I have to.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] The security guard will have your name and, um, there's a coffee shop on the, [wavering], first floor where we can, well, sit for exactly one hour to, umm, see if twenty years can fit into sixty minutes.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] I still remember how you take your coffee with two, [tender], sugars and just a drop of milk, um, unless that changed too along with, well, everything else I missed. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Some things never, [quiet], change Papa. [hangs up softly]
