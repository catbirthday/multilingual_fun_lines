Scenario: An insurance defense attorney runs into their longtime crush—who happens to be opposing counsel—in an empty courthouse elevator that breaks down between floors.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: 天哪，不是吧——电梯真的卡住了？这个，呃，这真的发生了，而且偏偏是跟你一起被困在这里？

Character 2 [pure]: [amused] 偏偏是我？这话挺有意思的，虽然作为对方律师这么打招呼是有点特别，不过被困在楼层之间确实改变了平时的职业关系呢。

Character 1 [pure]: [nervously] 我不是那个意思——听着，我们都知道这三年来你在证词询问时把我虐得体无完肤，现在我们俩被困在这个铁盒子里。

Character 2 [pure]: [softly] 虐得体无完肤？你真的是这么想的吗？因为在我看来，你的表现一直都相当出色。[pause] 也许太出色了。

Character 1 [pure]: [surprised] 等等，什么？你注意到我怎么——我是说，你除了案子之外还关注我的表现？

Character 2 [pure]: [stepping closer] David，我注意你的一切。你每次提出异议前都会敲三下笔，结案陈词时总是戴那条藏青色领带。

Character 1 [pure]: [breathless] 你知道那条领带的事？

Character 2 [pure]: 我知道你每天早上7点15分在楼下的咖啡车买同样的咖啡，黑咖啡加一块糖，还知道你走法院台阶时会一边走一边练习辩词。[quietly] 我知道很多事。

Character 1 [pure]: [boldly] 那你肯定也知道，过去十八个月我一直在找借口接你们律所的对手案子，哪怕是那些糟糕透顶的。

Character 2 [pure]: [laughs] Henderson那个滑倒案？那案子简直是垃圾你也知道的。你接那个案子就是为了在法庭上见我？

Character 1 [pure]: 完全站不住脚的。

Character 2 [pure]: [moving closer] 你知道我承认自己也在做同样的事有多不符合职业道德吗？接案子就是为了见你？

Character 1 [pure]: [shakily] 天啊，Rebecca。

Character 2 [pure]: 我们围着这件事兜圈子已经三年了，把法律辩论当成调情的前戏，现在我们真的被困在一起，无处可逃。[firmly] 所以我要问你一件事。

Character 1 [pure]: [quietly] 答案是愿意，不管你要问什么，从你第一次把我的专家证人驳得哑口无言然后对我微笑的那一刻起，答案就一直是愿意。

Character 2 [pure]: [grinning] 我本来是想问你要不要一起吃个晚饭的，不过这样也行。虽然我们可能该定一些关于现有案子的基本规则。

Character 1 [pure]: [laughing] 基本规则？我们被困在电梯里，我正努力克制不去吻你，你却想谈判条款？这简直是律师做的最律师的事了。

Character 2 [pure]: [teasingly] 嗯，我们可以把谈判留到以后，不过我得警告你——我谈判也从来不输的。[softer] 而且我想要这个已经很久了。

Character 1 [pure]: 电梯随时都会重新启动，等门一开，我们就得回到对立律师的身份，还有大概十五条职业道德问题要考虑。

Character 2 [pure]: [decisively] 那我们最好好好利用剩下的这几分钟，对吧？因为门一开，一切都会改变。[whispered] 但现在，我们只是两个普通人。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Oh god, not now—the elevator's actually stuck? This is, um, this is really happening with you of all people in here with me?

Character 2: [amused] Me of all people? That's an interesting way to greet opposing counsel, though I suppose being trapped between floors does change the usual professional dynamics.

Character 1: [nervously] I didn't mean it like—look, we both know you've been destroying me in depositions for three years running, and now we're stuck in a metal box together.

Character 2: [softly] Destroying you? Is that what you think I've been doing? Because from where I stand, you've been holding your own pretty impressively. [pause] Maybe too impressively.

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, what? You've noticed how I—I mean, you've been paying attention to my performance beyond just the cases?

Character 2: [stepping closer] David, I notice everything about you. The way you tap your pen exactly three times before making an objection, how you always wear that navy tie for closing arguments.

Character 1: [breathless] You know about the tie?

Character 2: I know you order the same coffee every morning at 7:15 from the cart outside, black with one sugar, and that you rehearse your arguments while walking up the courthouse steps. [quietly] I know a lot of things.

Character 1: [boldly] Then you must know that I've been finding excuses to take cases against your firm for the past eighteen months, even the terrible ones.

Character 2: [laughs] The Henderson slip-and-fall? That case was garbage and you knew it. You took that just to face me in court?

Character 1: Completely indefensible.

Character 2: [moving closer] You realize how incredibly unethical it is for me to admit that I've been doing the exact same thing? Taking cases just to see you?

Character 1: [shakily] Jesus, Rebecca.

Character 2: We've been dancing around this for three years, using legal arguments as foreplay, and now we're literally stuck together with nowhere to run. [firmly] So I'm going to ask you something.

Character 1: [quietly] The answer is yes, whatever you're about to ask, the answer has been yes since the first time you demolished my expert witness and then smiled at me.

Character 2: [grinning] I was going to ask if you wanted to grab dinner after this, but that works too. Though we should probably establish some ground rules about current cases.

Character 1: [laughing] Ground rules? You want to negotiate terms while we're trapped in an elevator and I'm trying not to kiss you? That's the most lawyer thing ever.

Character 2: [teasingly] Well, we could table the negotiation for later, but I should warn you—I never lose negotiations either. [softer] And I've wanted this for so long.

Character 1: The elevator's going to start moving any second, and when those doors open, we go back to being opposing counsel with about fifteen ethical violations to consider.

Character 2: [decisively] Then we better make these last few minutes count, shouldn't we? Because once those doors open, everything changes. [whispered] But right now, we're just two people.
