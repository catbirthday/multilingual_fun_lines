Scenario: A salutatorian returns to their small hometown after college to settle their late grandmother's estate and meets with the neighboring rancher who quietly cared for both the property and grandmother during her final years.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [gruff but gentle] 没想到你葬礼后这么快就回来了，我以为你需要多点时间，before dealing with all this paperwork and property business.

Character 2 [mix]: 反正迟早要回来的，说实话，在这里看着她的东西，比坐在我公寓里假装一切正常要好受些。[steadying breath]

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] 她总是提起你，你知道吗，尤其是最后那几个月，when I'd bring her groceries，或者修那个一直晃来晃去的破门。

Character 2 [mix]: [wistful] 她从来没告诉我你帮了她这么多，每次我从学校打电话回来，她就一直坚持说自己过得挺好的。

Character 1 [mix]: 这确实像Ruth的作风，倔得要命，就算要她的命她也不会承认需要帮助。[soft chuckle]

Character 2 [mix]: [grateful] 这地方看起来真的很棒，honestly, better than when I was growing up here，我知道这完全是因为你，这两年一直帮着打理。

Character 1 [mix]: [measured] 这不是施舍，如果你是这么想的话—你奶奶付了我合理的工钱，even when I tried to refuse，她还是坚持要给。

Character 2 [mix]: 我不是那个意思，我只是，[sighs]，我应该多回来看看的，should have taken a semester off，而不是追求那个什么拉丁语荣誉。

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] 别这样折磨自己，孩子—你打电话说当上了salutatorian的时候，她那个骄傲啊，practically told everyone in town including the mailman.

Character 2 [mix]: 300人里排第二，接到她摔倒的电话时感觉一点意义都没有，but I guess she always did care about that stuff. [hollow laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: 听着，关于这个ranch，我知道你需要卖掉，我有足够的资金，if you're willing to let me take it off your hands.

Character 2 [mix]: [surprised] 你？我是说，当然可以。

Character 1 [mix]: [realistic] 我会给你公平的市场价，不会压价什么的，而且你要知道，I plan to keep running it exactly how Ruth would have wanted.

Character 2 [mix]: [relieved] 天啊，这正是我希望的但不知道怎么开口—已经有开发商打了两次电话，wanting to subdivide it for housing.

Character 1 [mix]: 除非我死了他们才能在这块地上盖那些千篇一律的房子—要是我们让这种事发生，Ruth would come back and haunt us both. [protective growl]

Character 2 [mix]: [tender] 对了，她在遗嘱里给你留了东西，谷仓里那个旧皮马鞍，还有一封信要我转交给你。

Character 1 [mix]: [voice catching] 那是她父亲的马鞍，1952年从爱尔兰带过来的，她总是说—[clears throat]—说它应该属于懂得它价值的人。

Character 2 [mix]: 她明白你对这个地方的意义，对她的意义，even if she was too proud to say it properly while she was alive.

Character 1 [mix]: [rough with emotion] 你奶奶是我认识的最好的女人，keeping this ranch going，这是我能为她做的最起码的事。[pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [softly] 谢谢你，为所有的一切。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [gruff but gentle] Wasn't expecting you back so soon after the funeral, figured you'd need more time before dealing with all this paperwork and property business.

Character 2: I had to come back eventually, and honestly, being here with all her things feels better than sitting in my apartment pretending everything's normal. [steadying breath]

Character 1: [quietly] She talked about you constantly, you know, especially those last few months when I'd bring her groceries or fix that damned gate that kept swinging loose.

Character 2: [wistful] She never told me how much you were helping her, just kept insisting she was managing fine on her own whenever I called from school.

Character 1: That sounds like Ruth alright, stubborn as they come, wouldn't admit she needed help if her life depended on it. [soft chuckle]

Character 2: [grateful] The place looks incredible, honestly, better than when I was growing up here, and I know that's entirely thanks to you keeping everything running these past two years.

Character 1: [measured] It wasn't charity, if that's what you're thinking—your grandmother paid me fair wages for the work, insisted on it even when I tried to refuse.

Character 2: That's not what I meant, I just, [sighs], I should have been here more, should have taken a semester off instead of chasing that stupid Latin honors distinction.

Character 1: [firmly] Don't do that to yourself, kid—she was so damn proud when you called about making salutatorian, practically told everyone in town including the mailman.

Character 2: Second place in a class of three hundred seemed pretty meaningless when I got the call about her fall, but I guess she always did care about that stuff. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: Listen, about the ranch, I know you need to sell it and I've got the capital saved up if you're willing to let me take it off your hands.

Character 2: [surprised] You? I mean, of course.

Character 1: [realistic] I'll give you fair market value, none of this lowball nonsense, and you should know I plan to keep running it exactly how Ruth would have wanted.

Character 2: [relieved] God, yes, that's exactly what I was hoping for but didn't know how to ask—some developer already called twice wanting to subdivide it for housing.

Character 1: Over my dead body they'll put cookie-cutter houses on this land—Ruth would come back and haunt us both if we let that happen. [protective growl]

Character 2: [tender] She left you something in her will, by the way, that old leather saddle from the barn and a letter I'm supposed to give you.

Character 1: [voice catching] That was her father's saddle, brought it over from Ireland in 1952, and she always said—[clears throat]—said it belonged with someone who understood its value.

Character 2: She understood what you meant to this place, to her, even if she was too proud to say it properly while she was alive.

Character 1: [rough with emotion] Your grandmother was the finest woman I ever knew, and keeping this ranch going, it's the least I can do to honor her memory. [pause]

Character 2: [softly] Thank you, for everything.
