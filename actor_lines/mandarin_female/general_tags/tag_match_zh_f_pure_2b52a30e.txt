=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [冷冷地] 你跟我说要在一年最热的这周关掉我物业的制冷系统？这完全不能接受。

Character 2 [pure]: Harrison女士，我们只有17分钟整个电网就要崩溃了，您那6栋商业大楼的用电量比3个街区加起来还多。[急切地]

Character 1 [pure]: 那些楼里都是顶级租户，他们付高价就是为了不间断服务，我不可能因为你们部门没做好规划就违约。[不屑地]

Character 2 [pure]: [坚定地] 这不是规划的问题，这是物理极限——变压器现在真的在过热，如果我们不立刻减负荷，您连争论的电都没有了。

Character 1 [pure]: 那就去找别人减负荷，因为我这儿的责任条款显示，要是那些机房停电，我要赔几百万。

Character 2 [pure]: [沮丧地] 其他人一小时前收到紧急警报后都已经减了40%的用电，但显然您的大楼无视了强制削减通知。

Character 1 [pure]: 强制？我的律师可不这么看，尤其我们有2018年签的优先供电协议。[嗤笑]

Character 2 [pure]: [快速地] 三级紧急状态下那些协议自动失效，市长22分钟前就宣布了——听着，如果您现在配合，我可以给您3倍的标准需求响应补偿。

Character 1 [pure]: 3倍勉强够付法律风险，更别提租户在社交媒体上发他们办公室热化了的时候，我的名誉损失。

Character 2 [pure]: 女士，要是电网真崩了，最少72小时才能完全恢复，变电站要是损坏可能更久——您真要赌这个吗？

Character 1 [pure]: [尖锐地] 5倍。

Character 2 [pure]: [难以置信地] 5倍？市里哪有这种紧急预算，您也知道——上个月那事儿已经让我们捉襟见肘了。

Character 1 [pure]: 那也许市里该重新考虑我在新电厂附近的开发项目了，就是你们环保委员会一直卡着的那个。

Character 2 [pure]: 您真的要拿全市紧急状况来要挟您的开发项目？[呼气] 医院要是备用电源也没了，会死人的。

Character 1 [pure]: [盘算着] 医院有发电机，咱俩都清楚这就是居民不舒服的事儿，不是生死攸关——所以咱们谈谈桌面上真正的筹码吧。

Character 2 [pure]: [急促地] 好好好，如果您现在就给我大楼管理系统的远程权限，我个人保证支持您的开发提案——成交吗？

Character 1 [pure]: 白纸黑字，加上你们主任的签名，90秒内您就能完全控制我们的空调系统。

Character 2 [pure]: [疯狂打字] 我现在就起草备忘录，发给法务，还有——好了，已经转发到您邮箱了，电子签名已启用，求您了快给我那些访问代码。

Character 1 [pure]: 查一下您的系统——我刚授权了你们部门的IP地址，接下来4小时有效，不过我要10分钟内收到签好的文件。

Character 2 [pure]: [释然却苦涩] 收到了，正在启动减负荷程序，还有Harrison女士？下次有紧急情况，也许您可以考虑在我们快崩溃之前接个电话。[快速咔哒声]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [冷冷地] You're telling me you need to shut down my properties' cooling systems during the hottest week of the year? That's completely unacceptable.

Character 2: Mr. Harrison, we have seventeen minutes before the entire grid collapses, and your six commercial buildings are pulling more power than three city blocks combined. [急切地]

Character 1: Those buildings house premium tenants who pay top dollar specifically for uninterrupted service, and I'm not about to breach those contracts because your department failed to plan adequately. [不屑地]

Character 2: [坚定地] This isn't about planning, it's about physics—the transformers are literally overheating right now, and if we don't shed load immediately, you won't have any power to argue about.

Character 1: Then find someone else's load to shed, because I'm looking at liability clauses that would cost me millions if those server rooms go down.

Character 2: [沮丧地] Everyone else already reduced their usage by forty percent an hour ago when we sent the emergency alert, but apparently your buildings ignored the mandatory curtailment notice.

Character 1: Mandatory? My lawyers would disagree with that characterization, especially since we have priority service agreements dating back to 2018. [嗤笑]

Character 2: [快速地] Those agreements become void during a Stage Three emergency, which the mayor declared twenty-two minutes ago—look, I can offer compensation at triple the standard demand response rate if you cooperate now.

Character 1: Triple rate barely covers my legal exposure, let alone the reputation damage when my tenants start posting about their melting offices on social media.

Character 2: Sir, if this grid fails, we're looking at minimum seventy-two hours before full restoration, possibly longer if the substations sustain damage—is that really the gamble you want to take?

Character 1: [尖锐地] Make it five times.

Character 2: [难以置信地] Five times the rate? The city doesn't have that kind of emergency budget, and you know it—we're already stretched thin from last month's situation.

Character 1: Then perhaps the city should reconsider its position on my proposed development near the new power plant, the one your environmental board keeps blocking.

Character 2: You're seriously trying to leverage a citywide emergency for your development deal? [呼气] People could die if hospitals lose backup power.

Character 1: [盘算着] The hospitals have generators, and we both know this is about residential discomfort, not life and death—so let's discuss what's really on the table here.

Character 2: [急促地] Okay, fine, I'll personally advocate for your development proposal if you give me remote access to your building management systems right now—deal?

Character 1: Put it in writing with your director's signature, and you'll have full access to our HVAC controls within ninety seconds.

Character 2: [疯狂打字] I'm drafting the memorandum now, sending to legal, and—there, forwarded to your email with digital signatures enabled, please just give me those access codes.

Character 1: Check your system now—I've just authorized your department's IP address for the next four hours, though I expect that signed document back within ten minutes.

Character 2: [释然却苦涩] Got it, initiating load reduction protocols now, and Mr. Harrison? Next time there's an emergency, maybe consider answering your phone before we reach the breaking point. [快速咔哒声]
