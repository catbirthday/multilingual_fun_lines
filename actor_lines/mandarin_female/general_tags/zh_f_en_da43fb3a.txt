=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The ice beneath me is, um, [weakening], turning red with blood that won't stop flowing, and I mean, my pack left me here to, [defeated], die alone after the hunters got me, well, three times in the chest.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Such noble creatures always choose the most, [contemplative], poetic places to surrender their spirits, though I must admit your suffering seems, [examining], particularly acute tonight. [humming softly]

Character 1 [en]: You smell like, uhh, [frightened], sulfur and old promises, nothing like the forest spirits who usually, well, [trembling], come for the dying ones, I mean, you're something else entirely. [whimpers]

Character 2 [en]: [accommodating] Indeed I am something else, something that can, [measured], offer you more than the cold embrace of death that's, [circling], creeping through your veins even as we, [sedating], speak.

Character 1 [en]: [labored] Every breath feels like swallowing, [painful], broken glass and my vision keeps, [fading], blurring into darkness but somehow you're still crystal clear.

Character 2 [en]: [soothing] That's because, um, death cannot touch me, and well, [offering], neither would it need to touch you if you'd consider my proposition, I mean, eternal life has its appeals.

Character 1 [en]: [rasping] Um, what do you, well, want?

Character 2 [en]: [patient] Simply a hunting companion who knows the, [thoughtful], wild places and can track souls across both earthly forests and darker realms. [chuckles softly]

Character 1 [en]: My mother warned me about, um, [desperate], making deals when the blood runs thin and the mind gets, well, [clouding], foggy from pain, but I mean, watching my own reflection fade in this ice feels like, [hollow], drowning in reverse. [coughs blood]

Character 2 [en]: [understanding] Mothers always warn against me, though they rarely, [ironic], mention how their cubs will someday face choices between, [philosophical], dignity in death and purpose in damnation. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [struggling] Would I still, uhh, remember the taste of, well, rabbit bones and morning dew, or do you, I mean, take those simple pleasures too? [shivering]

Character 2 [en]: [reassuring] You'd remember everything but, um, [careful], taste it differently, like how moonlight changes the, well, [mysterious], color of familiar paths without erasing them, you know, transformed rather than forgotten. [whispers]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Well, um, I accept.

Character 2 [en]: [triumphant] The ice beneath you will, [transforming], crack in three heartbeats, and when you emerge from below, [reborn], you'll breathe water like air and hunt through, [darkening], dimensions your pack could never imagine. [laughs softly]

Character 1 [en]: [changing] The cold doesn't, err, [awakening], hurt anymore and my wounds are closing like flowers in reverse, but um, something ancient is, well, [growing], filling the spaces where my soul used to live.

Character 2 [en]: [satisfied] That's the first lesson of your new, [teaching], existence—pain transforms into power when you stop, [revealing], fighting against the very thing reshaping you.

Character 1 [en]: [newfound] My eyes can suddenly see through the, [amazed], ice to the fish sleeping below and beyond them to souls drifting like, [haunted], underwater stars. [gasps]

Character 2 [en]: [pleased] Welcome, hunter.

Character 1 [en]: [accepting] The forest will mourn the wolf I, [nostalgic], was while fearing the shadow I've, [transformed], become.

Character 2 [en]: [final] Um, well, let them mourn. [laughs darkly]
