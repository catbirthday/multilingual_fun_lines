=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [softly] 我一直在想你会不会回来，马修，虽然说实话，第三年过去了连个电话都没有，我就不再期待了。

Character 2 [pure]: [hollow voice] 出事之后我没法面对您，报纸上说的那些...说我在手术时，[exhales]，说我喝醉了做手术，害死了病人。

Character 1 [pure]: 你以为我不知道你喝酒的事？我在医院干了60年，你爸葬礼那天我就闻到你身上的酒味了，你以为没人看见的时候，我看到你手在发抖。

Character 2 [pure]: [defensive] 所以您早就知道？就这么眼睁睁看着我越陷越深，直到有人死在我手术台上？

Character 1 [pure]: 我能说什么你才会听呢？你是天才外科医生啊，约翰霍普金斯的高材生，各大期刊都发表你的论文，而我呢，只是个过时的老妈妈，还在唠叨什么便盆的事。

Character 2 [pure]: 您从来都不是"只是"什么，妈，您在急诊室救的人比我多多了，47年，每一个班都清醒着。

Character 1 [pure]: [wistful] 你外公也是酒鬼，你知道吗？在车库里藏酒瓶，撞坏了三辆车才被吊销驾照。[sighs]

Character 1 [pure]: 那把他整个人都毁了。

Character 2 [pure]: [quietly] 我不知道这些，您从来没跟我提过他，只说他在我出生前就去世了。

Character 2 [pure]: 要是我早知道家里有这个病史，也许我会更小心，会注意那些征兆，在太迟之前就去寻求帮助。

Character 1 [pure]: 或者你还是会做一样的事，觉得自己不一样，觉得自己特别，比基因和家族诅咒都要强大。

Character 1 [pure]: 亨德森一家上个月来找我，就是那个去世女士的家人，他们想知道我是不是觉得你是个恶魔。[pause]

Character 2 [pure]: 您怎么说的？说您儿子就像法庭上说的那样，是个自以为是上帝的自恋狂？

Character 2 [pure]: [bitter laugh] 我自己的律师都这么说我，想博取陪审团的同情来减轻判决。

Character 1 [pure]: [gently] 我跟他们说，你在拿起手术刀之前就已经破碎了，卓越和空虚往往形影不离。[quieter] 他们听了并没有得到安慰。

Character 1 [pure]: 我其实也没有，因为知道原因并不能挽回什么，不能让他们的女儿活过来，不能让你的职业生涯回来，也不能找回我们失去的这5年。

Character 2 [pure]: 我现在在五金店工作，您能想象吗？了不起的陈马修在那调漆配钥匙，那些顾客根本不知道我以前是谁。

Character 2 [pure]: 有时候在柜台听到顾客抱怨身体不适，我差点就要纠正他们，然后想起来我已经不能再给医疗建议了，连拔个刺都不行。[hollow laugh]

Character 1 [pure]: [wearily] 到了我这个年纪，原谅就像搬石头，一块比一块重，而我已经没有力气再搬了。

Character 2 [pure]: 我不是来求原谅的，妈，只是想让您知道我戒酒了，14个月了，还有我每天都在想那个女人，想如果我真的是我装出来的那个医生，她今天会是什么样子。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [softly] I wondered if you'd ever come back, Matthew, though honestly I stopped expecting it after the third year passed without even a phone call.

Character 2: [hollow voice] I couldn't face you after what happened, after everything the papers said about me, about the patient who died because I was, [exhales], because I was drunk during surgery.

Character 1: You think I didn't know about the drinking? Sixty years in medicine, I could smell it on you at your father's funeral, saw your hands shake when you thought no one was watching.

Character 2: [defensive] So you knew and said nothing? Just let me spiral until someone died on my table?

Character 1: What could I say that you would have heard? You were the brilliant surgeon, top of your class at Johns Hopkins, published in every journal, and I was just your ancient mother who still talked about bedpans.

Character 2: You were never just anything, Mom, you saved more lives in that emergency ward than I ever did, stone-cold sober every single shift for forty-seven years.

Character 1: [wistful] Your grandfather was an alcoholic too, did you know that? Hid bottles in the garage, crashed three cars before they took his license away. [sighs]

Character 1: It broke him.

Character 2: [quietly] I didn't know that, you never told me about him, just that he died before I was born.

Character 2: Maybe if I'd known there was a history, maybe I could have been more careful, watched for the signs, gotten help before it was too late.

Character 1: Or maybe you would have done exactly what you did anyway, believing you were different, special, stronger than genetics and family curses.

Character 1: The Hendersons came to see me last month, the family of the woman who died, wanted to know if I thought you were a monster. [pause]

Character 2: What did you tell them? That your son was exactly what they said in court, a narcissist who thought he was God?

Character 2: [bitter laugh] That's what my own lawyer called me, trying to get a lighter sentence by throwing me on the jury's mercy.

Character 1: [gently] I told them you were broken long before you ever picked up a scalpel, that excellence and emptiness often walk hand in hand. [quieter] They didn't find comfort in that.

Character 1: Neither did I, really, because knowing why something happens doesn't undo the damage, doesn't bring back their daughter or your career or the five years we've lost.

Character 2: I work at a hardware store now, can you imagine? The great Matthew Chen mixing paint and cutting keys for people who have no idea who I used to be.

Character 2: Sometimes I catch myself about to correct someone's medical complaint at the counter, then I remember I'm not allowed to give medical advice anymore, not even about a splinter. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: [wearily] At my age, forgiveness feels like lifting boulders, each one heavier than the last, and I'm running out of strength for the lifting.

Character 2: I'm not asking for forgiveness, Mom, just wanted you to know I'm sober now, fourteen months, and that I think about that woman every single day, wonder who she'd be today if I'd been the doctor I pretended to be.
