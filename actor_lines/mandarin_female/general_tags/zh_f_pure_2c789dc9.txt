=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: Maria？你怎么... 我不知道你在这儿工作，在这个学校，给孩子们打饭。[stunned exhale]

Character 2 [pure]: Danny？天哪，真的是你啊，就这么站在我的食堂里，七年了，七年啊，连个电话都没有。

Character 1 [pure]: [quietly] 我必须得远离你们，你知道的。我选的这条路，我干的那些事儿，早晚会牵连到你的。

Character 2 [pure]: 是你选的，Danny。你选了子弹和血钱，不要家庭，不要当舅舅，我孩子有时候还问起你呢。

Character 1 [pure]: [hollow] 你孩子在这个学校上学？求你告诉我不是，Maria，求你说你只是为了福利才在这儿工作的。

Character 2 [pure]: [soft trembling] 我大女儿Sophie，她在这儿上四年级。你为什么用那种眼神问我这个？

Character 1 [pure]: [urgent whisper] 你得马上给学校打电话，就说家里有急事，马上把Sophie接走，别问为什么。

Character 2 [pure]: [growing fear] Danny，你做了什么？你为什么会在我女儿的学校，眼里还是那种黑暗？

Character 1 [pure]: [strained] 我是来带走别人家孩子的，但现在知道Sophie在这儿，一切都变了。这活儿我不能干了，今天不行。

Character 2 [pure]: [barely breathing] 有人雇你伤害一个孩子？我的天啊，Danny，你变成什么怪物了？

Character 1 [pure]: [defensive] 不是伤害，只是带走当筹码，但现在都不重要了，因为我要退出这整件事。

Character 2 [pure]: [desperate whisper] 退出？像你这样的人，他们不会让你就这么退出的，Danny，这是你自己跟我说过的。

Character 1 [pure]: [resigned] 他们会来找我的，是啊，但我会搞定的。你就答应我，今天之后带着孩子搬走，搬得远远的。

Character 2 [pure]: [breaking] 我就是给六岁小孩打通心粉的，Danny。我不能就这么消失，我还有房贷，Sophie在这儿有朋友，这是我们的生活啊。

Character 1 [pure]: [firmly] 我存了钱，够你们重新开始干干净净的生活。虽然是血钱，但能保你们平安，这才是最重要的。

Character 2 [pure]: [bitter laugh] 你的钱？就是那些让我们失去一切的钱，让妈哭着睡觉，一直想她到底哪里做错了的钱？

Character 1 [pure]: 妈从来不明白，我离开就是为了保护你们所有人。我接的每个活儿，越的每条线，都是为了不让狼进我们家门。

Character 2 [pure]: 她死的时候还以为你恨我们，Danny。[voice cracking] 她在病床上喊着你的名字走的，而你天知道在哪儿。

Character 1 [pure]: [devastated] 我在布拉格接活儿。葬礼过了三天我才知道，从那以后，这个重担我每天都背着。[long exhale]

Character 2 [pure]: [gently] 留下来吧。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Maria? What are you... I didn't know you worked here, at this school, serving lunch to kids. [stunned exhale]

Character 2: Danny? Oh my God, it's really you standing in my cafeteria after seven years of nothing, not even a phone call.

Character 1: [quietly] I had to stay away, you know that. The life I chose, the things I do, they would've followed me back to you eventually.

Character 2: You chose it, Danny. You chose bullets and blood money over having a family, over being an uncle to my kids who ask about you sometimes.

Character 1: [hollow] Your kids go to this school? Please tell me they don't, Maria, please say you're just working here for the benefits.

Character 2: [soft trembling] My oldest, Sophie, she's in fourth grade here. Why are you asking me this with that look on your face?

Character 1: [urgent whisper] You need to call the school, say there's a family emergency, and get Sophie out of here right now, don't ask questions.

Character 2: [growing fear] Danny, what did you do? Why are you here at my daughter's school with that same darkness in your eyes?

Character 1: [strained] I'm here for someone else's kid, but now that I know Sophie's here, everything changes. I can't do this job, not today.

Character 2: [barely breathing] Someone hired you to hurt a child? My God, Danny, what kind of monster have you become?

Character 1: [defensive] Not hurt, just take them for leverage, but it doesn't matter now because I'm walking away from this whole thing.

Character 2: [desperate whisper] Walking away? They don't let people like you just walk away, Danny, you told me that yourself years ago.

Character 1: [resigned] They'll come for me, yeah, but I'll handle it. Just promise me you'll move, take the kids somewhere far from here after today.

Character 2: [breaking] I serve mac and cheese to six-year-olds, Danny. I can't just disappear, I have a mortgage, Sophie has friends here, this is our life.

Character 1: [firmly] I have money saved, enough for you to start over clean. It's blood money but it'll keep you safe, which is all that matters now.

Character 2: [bitter laugh] Your money? The same money that cost us everything, that made Mom cry herself to sleep wondering where she went wrong?

Character 1: Mom never understood that I was protecting all of you by leaving. Every job I took, every line I crossed, it kept the wolves away from our door.

Character 2: She died thinking you hated us, Danny. [voice cracking] She died calling your name in that hospital bed while you were God knows where.

Character 1: [devastated] I was in Prague on a job. I found out three days after the funeral, and I've carried that weight every single day since then. [long exhale]

Character 2: [gently] Stay.
