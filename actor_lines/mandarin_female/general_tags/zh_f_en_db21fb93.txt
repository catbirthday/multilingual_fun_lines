=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [steady] I've changed locks after break-ins before, but, [gentle], this feels different because it's a school, [careful], where kids should feel safe.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Yeah, um, I keep thinking about Marcus and, [pained], how I should have seen this coming, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] Well, uh, from what you've told me, [understanding], you did everything you could to help that boy, [reassuring], and sometimes people just, [trailing off], make choices we can't control.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] But I'm supposed to protect these kids, [breaking], all of them, even the ones who leave.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Listen, um, I've seen plenty of situations where good people, [measured], blame themselves for things that aren't their fault, you know?

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, uh, Marcus was brilliant, [wistful], but so angry underneath all that potential, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, changing these locks, [purposeful], it's not about keeping him out forever, it's about, [hopeful], giving everyone time to heal and, um, maybe find a way forward.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] I hadn't, um, thought about it that way, [contemplative], like we're not closing a door permanently but, [realizing], just pausing to, uh, reset everything.

Character 1 [en]: [working] These new locks I'm installing, [explaining], they're the kind that can be reprogrammed, [meaningful], so when you're ready, when he's ready, access can change.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Um, thank you.

Character 1 [en]: [focused] You know, I've been doing this for twenty years, [reflective], and the hardest locks to open aren't on doors, [philosophical], they're the ones people put around their hearts.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] Marcus put those locks there himself after his father left, [remembering], and I tried so hard to find the right key, [regretful], but some doors only open from the inside.

Character 1 [en]: [wise] That's exactly right, and, [encouraging], maybe this incident is his way of rattling the handle, [optimistic], asking if anyone still cares enough to answer.

Character 2 [en]: You really think, um, this could be, [uncertain], a cry for help rather than, well, an attack?

Character 1 [en]: [confident] In my experience, uh, people who break into places they used to belong, [knowing], are usually looking for something they lost there, um.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] He left his graduation tassel in the trophy case, [remembering], the one he earned despite everything, [proud], and I kept it there hoping he'd come back for it properly, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Well then, maybe these new locks, [thoughtful], aren't about keeping him out but, um, about making sure when he comes back, it's through the front door.

Character 2 [en]: [decided] I'm going to, um, call his mother tomorrow and, [determined], see if we can arrange a proper meeting, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] That's good.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] You've given me more than new locks tonight, [sincere], you've, well, helped me see this whole situation differently, I mean.
