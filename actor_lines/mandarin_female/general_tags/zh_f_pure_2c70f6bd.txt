Scenario: Two college roommates reunite by chance at an airport gate after fifteen years, when one's packaging design company just lost the contract that would have saved the other's struggling startup.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [startled] Marcus？是你——

Character 2 [pure]: 哦天哪，Jamie！这也太巧了吧，我昨天Boxify那个项目黄了的时候还正好想起你呢。

Character 1 [pure]: [tense] 哦对，Boxify的项目。所以你已经知道了，那咱俩在机场偶遇这事儿就更尴尬了。

Character 2 [pure]: 等等，你说我知道是什么意——哦。哦不是吧。别告诉我你们就是跟我们抢那个合同的创业公司。

Character 1 [pure]: 抢这个词用得太客气了。你们公司那个环保方案直接把我们碾压了，不过现在说这些也没意义了，反正我们下个月就要关门了。

Character 2 [pure]: Jamie，我真不知道那是你的公司。标书上就写着"NovaPack Solutions"，我根本没往那方面想。[exhales] 天哪，要是我知道的话...

Character 1 [pure]: 知道了又怎样？故意输掉？拜托，Marcus，咱们都清楚现在商场是什么样。这又不是大二那会儿，一起吃泡面一起熬夜的时候了。

Character 2 [pure]: [defensive] 这不公平吧。我至少会联系你的，说不定咱们能合作或者找个双赢的办法，而不是这样互相竞标。

Character 1 [pure]: 合作。是啊。你们公司4000万的融资，想跟我这个连工资都快发不出来的车库小作坊合作。[bitter laugh]

Character 2 [pure]: [quietly] 也不是一开始就有4000万的。我也是从车库起步的，你还记得吗？毕业那年夏天，你去读研，我靠信用卡度日的时候？

Character 1 [pure]: [softer] 嗯，记得。你还给我发过第一个原型机的照片，用麦片盒和胶带做的。其实我一直留着呢。

Character 2 [pure]: 你还留着？[surprised laugh] 这个...我以为Sarah和租房那些破事儿之后，你早就把所有东西都删了。

Character 1 [pure]: [wistful] 没有，好的东西我都留着。那是在一切变复杂、咱们断联之前的事。15年了，还为大学那点破事儿较劲，是不是太久了？

Character 2 [pure]: 确实太久了。听着，我知道现在说这个时机特别不好，你公司的事儿...但要是落地后能一起喝个咖啡？如果你不是要转机的话。

Character 1 [pure]: [hesitant] 我不知道这样是不是...算了，你知道吗？行吧。反正我也没有公司要赶回去了。[rueful laugh]

Character 2 [pure]: [carefully] Jamie，如果——先听我说完——如果NovaPack还能挽救点什么呢？我们正好在找人负责一个新部门。

Character 1 [pure]: 求你别给我安排什么同情工作，Marcus。那比输掉合同还让人难受。我还有点自尊的。

Character 2 [pure]: [earnest] 不是同情。

Character 1 [pure]: 不是？那是什么？在我看来，就是我那个成功的前室友因为不小心搞垮了我的公司而内疚呗。

Character 2 [pure]: [firmly] 是我看到人才就想要。你的方案很精彩，Jamie，创新程度我们根本比不上。我们赢在基础设施，不是创意。我需要思维不一样的人，而你一直都是这样的人。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [startled] Marcus? Is that—

Character 2: Oh my god, Jamie! This is completely surreal, I was literally just thinking about you yesterday when the Boxify deal fell through.

Character 1: [tense] Right, the Boxify deal. So you know about that already, which makes this whole accidental airport run-in thing even more awkward than it needs to be.

Character 2: Wait, what do you mean I know about—oh. Oh no. Don't tell me you're the startup we were competing against for that contract.

Character 1: Competing is a generous word for what happened. Your company basically crushed us with that sustainability pitch, not that it matters now since we're shutting down operations next month anyway.

Character 2: Jamie, I had no idea it was your company. The proposal just came through as 'NovaPack Solutions' and I never made the connection. [exhales] God, if I'd known...

Character 1: You'd what? Have thrown the pitch? Come on, Marcus, we both know how the business world works now. It's not like sophomore year when we'd share ramen and pull all-nighters together.

Character 2: [defensive] That's not fair. I would have at least reached out, maybe we could have collaborated or found some way to work together instead of bidding against each other.

Character 1: Collaborated. Right. Your company with its forty million in funding wants to collaborate with my garage startup that can barely make payroll. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [quietly] It wasn't always forty million. I started in a garage too, remember? That summer after graduation when you went to grad school and I was living off credit cards?

Character 1: [softer] Yeah, I remember. You sent me that photo of your first prototype made from cereal boxes and duct tape. I still have it somewhere, actually.

Character 2: You kept that? [surprised laugh] That's... I mean, I figured you'd deleted everything after that whole mess with Sarah and the lease situation.

Character 1: [wistful] No, I kept the good stuff. Before everything got complicated and we stopped talking. Fifteen years is a long time to hold onto old college drama, isn't it?

Character 2: Way too long. Look, I know this is terrible timing with your company and everything, but maybe we could grab coffee when we land? If you're not connecting somewhere else, I mean.

Character 1: [hesitant] I don't know if that's... actually, you know what? Sure. It's not like I have a company to rush back to anymore anyway. [rueful laugh]

Character 2: [carefully] Jamie, what if—and just hear me out—what if there was a way to salvage something from NovaPack? We're actually looking for someone to head up a new division.

Character 1: Please don't offer me a pity job, Marcus. That's somehow worse than losing the contract in the first place. I've got some dignity left.

Character 2: [earnest] It's not pity.

Character 1: No? Then what is it? Because from where I'm sitting, it looks like my successful former roommate feeling guilty about accidentally destroying my company.

Character 2: [firmly] It's me recognizing talent when I see it. Your proposal was brilliant, Jamie, innovative in ways ours wasn't. We won on infrastructure, not ideas. I need someone who thinks differently, and that was always you.
