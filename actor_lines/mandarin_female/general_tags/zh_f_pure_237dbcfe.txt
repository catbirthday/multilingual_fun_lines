=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: 听着，我知道我让你做的事违背你所有的原则，但是爸最多还有三个月，这个真相会彻底毁了他的。

Character 2 [pure]: [firmly] 你让我伪造法律文件，在血缘关系上撒谎，拿我整个职业生涯冒险，甚至可能面临刑事指控。

Character 1 [pure]: 就一份检测而已。[exhales]

Character 2 [pure]: [incredulous] 就一份检测？

Character 1 [pure]: [desperately] 你想想妈—她四十年前犯了一个错，现在这个错要变成爸临终前对他们婚姻的全部记忆了。

Character 2 [pure]: [quieter] 我做DNA鉴定十五年了，每一份报告背后都是活生生的人，他们的人生值得知道真相，不管多痛苦。

Character 1 [pure]: [bitter laugh] 真相。

Character 2 [pure]: [defensive] 对，真相。

Character 1 [pure]: [building intensity] 真相就是爸花了四十年养大别人的亲生孩子，全心全意地爱着，现在你要给他一张纸，把这一切都抹杀掉？

Character 2 [pure]: 我不想给他任何东西—结果直接发给申请鉴定的遗产律师，而且[sighs]伪造报告是诈骗罪。

Character 1 [pure]: [pleading] 莎拉，求你了，咱俩都明白不是血缘让他成为我们的父亲—是他每天都在，教我们骑自行车，我们生病时守夜。

Character 2 [pure]: [voice cracking] 你以为我不懂吗？你以为我想当那个签字毁掉咱们家的人吗？[pause] 可是我在这行，诚信是我唯一拥有的东西。

Character 1 [pure]: 你的诚信不能安慰爸，当他临终时相信自己一辈子活在谎言里，怀疑妈是不是真的爱过他。

Character 2 [pure]: [shakily] 那要是他走后别人再做检测呢？发现我撒谎了呢？我会失去执照，名誉，我奋斗的一切。

Character 1 [pure]: [grimly] 如果我们悄悄处理遗产就不会有人再测了—我已经跟律师谈过了，如果第一次检测确认是亲生的，就取消这个要求。

Character 2 [pure]: [stunned whisper] 你早就计划好了？天啊，你把每个环节都想透了是吧？就像谈生意一样。

Character 1 [pure]: [wearily] 总得有人做。

Character 2 [pure]: [anguished] 我需要时间想想，好吗？这不只是在事业和家庭之间选择—这关乎我是个什么样的人。

Character 1 [pure]: [gently] 我知道我的要求让你背叛了所有的信念，我恨自己提出这种事，但有时候保护我们爱的人就是要做不可能的选择。

Character 2 [pure]: [barely audible] 结果周一要交。[long exhale] 我明天做检测，然后决定...我能不能接受改掉结果。[hollow whisper] 我只能保证这些。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Listen, I know what I'm asking you to do goes against everything you believe in, but Dad has maybe three months left, and this truth would absolutely destroy him.

Character 2: [firmly] You're asking me to falsify a legal document, to lie about someone's biological heritage, to risk my entire career and possibly face criminal charges.

Character 1: It's just one test. [exhales]

Character 2: [incredulous] Just one test?

Character 1: [desperately] Think about Mom—she made one mistake forty years ago, and now it's going to define everything Dad remembers about their marriage in his final days.

Character 2: [quieter] I've been running DNA profiles for fifteen years, and every single one represents real people with real lives that deserve the truth, no matter how painful.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] The truth.

Character 2: [defensive] Yes, the truth.

Character 1: [building intensity] The truth is that Dad spent forty years raising someone else's biological child as his own, loving them completely, and now you want to hand him a piece of paper that erases all of that?

Character 2: I don't want to hand him anything—the results go directly to the estate lawyer who requested them, and [sighs] falsifying them would be fraud.

Character 1: [pleading] Sarah, please, we both know that biological connection isn't what made him our father—it was showing up every single day, teaching us to ride bikes, staying up when we were sick.

Character 2: [voice cracking] You think I don't know that? You think I want to be the one whose signature destroys our family? [pause] But my integrity is all I have in this job.

Character 1: Your integrity won't comfort Dad when he's dying believing his whole life was built on a lie, wondering if Mom ever really loved him.

Character 2: [shakily] And what happens when someone else runs the test after he's gone? When they find out I lied? I lose my license, my reputation, everything I've worked for.

Character 1: [grimly] No one else will run it if we handle the estate quietly—I've already talked to the lawyer about dropping the requirement if the first test comes back confirming paternity.

Character 2: [stunned whisper] You've already been planning this? God, you've thought through every angle, haven't you? Like it's just another business deal to negotiate.

Character 1: [wearily] Someone has to.

Character 2: [anguished] I need time to think about this, okay? This isn't just about choosing between family and career—it's about who I am as a person.

Character 1: [gently] I know what I'm asking costs you everything you stand for, and I hate myself for even suggesting it, but sometimes protecting the people we love means making impossible choices.

Character 2: [barely audible] The results are due Monday. [long exhale] I'll run the test tomorrow and then decide if I can live with changing what I find. [hollow whisper] That's all I can promise.
