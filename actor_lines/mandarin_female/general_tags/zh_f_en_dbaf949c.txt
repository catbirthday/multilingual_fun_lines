=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Um, they told me you were getting, [voice breaking], married but I didn't believe them until I saw you standing here in, well, [trembling], that dress looking like everything I dreamed about for, um, five years.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, you were gone for half a decade without a single, um, [quieter], letter so what exactly was I supposed to do?

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Every letter I wrote would have been, um, [pained], treason because how could I tell you what you meant to me, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: You're the crown prince and you're standing here, [incredulous], three days before my wedding talking about, [shaking], dreams and letters when you could have just, [bitter], told me before you left.

Character 1 [en]: [anguished] I was eighteen and terrified that loving you would mean, well, [choking up], destroying you because the court would never accept someone without, um, [trailing off], noble blood as their future queen, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, too late now.

Character 1 [en]: [advancing] Um, is it though, because I'm standing here telling you that I'd, well, [passionate], abdicate the throne if that's what it took.

Character 2 [en]: Don't you dare put this, um, [angry], choice on me when you're the one who left without, well, [voice cracking], fighting for us when it actually mattered, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Then I'll fight now because I've learned that duty without, [intense], love is just a slow death and watching you marry him would, [breaking], kill whatever's left of my soul.

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] My entire family has already traveled here and the, [wavering], preparations cost them everything they had saved for twenty years.

Character 1 [en]: [diplomatic] The royal treasury will cover every expense and, [earnest], compensate them tenfold if necessary.

Character 2 [en]: You think money can fix the, [hurt], scandal of a commoner leaving someone at the altar for the, [sarcastic], crown prince who suddenly remembered she existed after five, [hollow], years of silence?

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Um, I never forgot you, not for a single day, and every, [raw], battle I survived was because I told myself that maybe, well, [hopeful], someday I'd be brave enough to tell you the truth, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Well, the truth is that I spent, um, [tearful], two years waiting before I finally accepted that you weren't, I mean, [resigned], coming back for me.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] But I did come back, and um, [tender], maybe that's all that matters now, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Do you have any idea how many nights I stared at the, [crying], palace gates hoping to see you walk through them before I finally, [whispered], forced myself to say yes to someone else? [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: I know I failed you then but I'm here, um, [resolute], now asking for the chance to spend every remaining day proving that you were always, well, [devoted], my choice.

Character 2 [en]: [torn] Um, God, why did you have to come back now when I'd finally, well, [anguished], convinced myself I could be happy without you, I mean?

Character 1 [en]: [creative] Because the universe has a twisted sense of, [gentle], humor but also because maybe true love refuses to, [certain], follow anyone's timeline but its own.

Character 2 [en]: [surrendering] Three days—you have three days to convince my family, [breathless], the court, and everyone else that this isn't the biggest mistake of our lives.
