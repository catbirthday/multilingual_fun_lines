=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Um, everyone keeps calling me, [barely audible], the infant because I'm only sixteen and, well, I don't know how to, [overwhelmed], make them see that I belong here just like, um, everyone else.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Listen, being the youngest person, [gentle], on campus isn't something to be ashamed of, it's actually, [reassuring], remarkable that you're here at all when most kids your age are still in high school.

Character 1 [en]: But they treat me like I'm, [voice cracking], some kind of mascot or pet project instead of a real student with actual thoughts and feelings.

Character 2 [en]: [pacifying] Well, um, the thing is, [understanding], people fear what they don't understand and, uh, your brilliance makes them, [thoughtful], uncomfortable with their own limitations. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] I mean, I just want to, um, [shaky], fit in somewhere without having to pretend I'm, well, [exhausted], older or dumber than I actually am.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Um, you know what, [contemplative], I was the youngest in my year too, not as young as you but, well, [nostalgic], I remember feeling like I was watching college through glass, er, never quite touching the real experience. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [curious] How did you eventually find your, [hopeful], place here without losing yourself in the process? [sniffles]

Character 2 [en]: [letting-go] I stopped trying to be what they, [frank], expected and started being unapologetically myself, even if that meant, [confident], eating lunch alone with quantum physics textbooks.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitant] Um, but what if being myself means, well, [vulnerable], crying when the pressure gets too heavy or, um, [whispered], calling my mom every night before bed? [voice breaks]

Character 2 [en]: [tender] Well, I still call my mom, um, [smiling], every Sunday and sometimes I cry in the bathroom between, [honest], classes because this place can be, uh, [heavy], absolutely brutal even for those of us who supposedly belong here.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You mean even seniors like you still, um, [processing], struggle with feeling like you're enough?

Character 2 [en]: [reflective] Every single day I wonder if, um, [vulnerable], I'm smart enough to be here, I mean, imposter syndrome doesn't discriminate.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Well, um, maybe being called the infant isn't, [reconsidering], the worst thing because at least, er, [growing], they acknowledge I exist even if it's not, well, [accepting], in the way I'd prefer. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [proud] That's growth.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] The next time someone calls me infant, [steady], I'll remind them that infants grow up to change, [fierce], the world while they're still stuck in the same place.

Character 2 [en]: [impressed] There it is.

Character 1 [en]: [confident] Um, you know what, I think I'm going to, [excited], start that study group for advanced mathematics even if, well, [bold], I'm the only one who shows up at first. [laughs softly]

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] Well, um, I'll be there because honestly, [admiring], you understand differential equations better than our professor does.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] I mean, thank you for not trying to, um, [emotional], baby me or tell me to wait until I'm older to, well, [teary], feel these things.

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] Um, your age doesn't invalidate your, [respectful], experiences or emotions, and anyone who thinks otherwise is, well, [firm], missing out on knowing someone pretty extraordinary.
