Scenario: A person drowning in medical debt finally answers a call from a hospital financial counselor after months of avoidance.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [very quietly] 我，呃……我知道我一直在躲你们的电话。就是每次看到医院的号码，我整个人就……[exhales] 怎么说呢，像是全身都麻木了，你懂吗？

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] 嘿，真的，我完全不会评判你。你不知道有多少人跟我说过一模一样的事。[pause] 那，呃，我们就从你现在的情况开始聊，好吗？

Character 1 [mix]: [shaky voice] 现在？我……天啊，我感觉自己快淹死了。[nervous laugh] 这个词一直在我脑海里，every bill that comes in feels like another wave pushing me under.

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] 我明白。

Character 1 [mix]: [anxiously] 问题是，我从来没想过会变成这样，你知道吗？我是说，我有保险，至少我以为我有，but then there were all these out-of-network charges and deductibles，还有……[sighs] 我甚至看不懂一半的账单在收什么钱。

Character 2 [mix]: [reassuringly] 好的，这其实特别常见，说实话，这个账单系统，呃，even for those of us who work with it every day，都觉得很混乱。让我调出你的账户，我们可以一项一项地看。

Character 1 [mix]: 六万三千块。[bitter laugh] 这就是我欠的钱。这个数字在我脑子里转了好几个月了。

Character 2 [mix]: [empathetically] 背着这个数字确实很沉重。但是听我说，这只是，呃，初始金额，before we look at any financial assistance programs，还有付款计划，或者慈善医疗的选择。[typing] 你实际需要付的可能会完全不一样。

Character 1 [mix]: [defeated] 我一年赚两万八。税前。我连买菜都勉强，how is any amount going to be manageable? 我已经连续吃了三个月的方便面了。

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] 两万八？好，等一下……

Character 1 [mix]: [desperately] 拜托别告诉我说我赚太多了。

Character 2 [mix]: 其实不是，you're well within our charity care guidelines. [pause] 根据你的收入，你可以申请到90%的减免，depending on your other expenses，甚至可能全额免除。

Character 1 [mix]: [gasps softly] 等等，什么？

Character 2 [mix]: [cheerfully] 对啊，所以，呃，这就是我一直想联系你的原因！We have programs specifically for situations like yours，但是申请有时间限制。[quickly] 好消息是如果我们动作快，可以追溯一部分。

Character 1 [mix]: [voice breaking] 我为这个事情恐慌发作了好几个月。[sniffle] 我不接电话了，不拆信了……我以为我的人生基本上完了。

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] 嘿，你的人生绝对没有完。[chuckles] 说真的，I've seen people bounce back from much worse situations. 今天我们先让你加入援助计划，然后再处理剩下的部分，如果还有的话。

Character 1 [mix]: [relieved] 我不敢相信这是真的。我一直觉得肯定有什么陷阱，比如，哦等等，you had insurance so you don't qualify，或者，呃，你太年轻了之类的荒唐理由。

Character 2 [mix]: [friendly] 没有任何陷阱，我保证。你看，医院真的想帮助你这种情况的人，真的。只是这个系统，呃，admittedly terrible at communicating that. [sighs] 这也是我在这里的部分原因。

Character 1 [mix]: 天啊，我觉得自己好蠢，躲了这么久。[exhales] 那些失眠的夜晚，我本来可以就……接个电话。

Character 2 [mix]: [sincerely] 你一点都不蠢。恐惧有时候，呃，it's paralyzing sometimes，尤其是当你面对那些感觉不可能的数字。[pause] 重要的是你现在在这里了，我们会一起解决这个问题，好吗？


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [very quietly] I, um... I know I've been avoiding your calls. It's just that every time I see the hospital number, I kind of freeze up, you know? Like my whole body just goes [exhales] numb.

Character 2: [warmly] Hey, no judgment here, honestly. You'd be surprised how many people I talk to who've done the exact same thing. [pause] So, uh, let's just start with where you're at right now, okay?

Character 1: [shaky voice] Right now? I'm... God, I'm drowning. [nervous laugh] That's actually the word that keeps coming to mind. Every bill that comes in feels like another wave pushing me under.

Character 2: [gently] I hear you.

Character 1: [anxiously] The thing is, I never thought I'd be here, you know? I mean, I had insurance, or I thought I did, but then there were all these, um, out-of-network charges and deductibles and... [sighs] I don't even understand half of what I'm being billed for.

Character 2: [reassuringly] Okay, so that's actually really common, and honestly, the billing system is, uh, genuinely confusing even for those of us who work with it every day. Let me pull up your account here and we can go through it line by line.

Character 1: Sixty-three thousand dollars. [bitter laugh] That's what I owe. I've been carrying that number around in my head for months now.

Character 2: [empathetically] That's a heavy number to carry. But listen, that's the, um, initial amount before we look at any financial assistance programs, payment plans, or charity care options. [typing] The actual amount you'll need to pay could be significantly different.

Character 1: [defeated] I make twenty-eight thousand a year. Before taxes. How is any amount going to be manageable when I can barely afford groceries? I've been eating, like, ramen for three months straight.

Character 2: [firmly] Twenty-eight thousand? Okay, hang on...

Character 1: [desperately] Please don't tell me I make too much.

Character 2: Actually, no, you're well within our charity care guidelines. [pause] Based on your income, you could qualify for up to ninety percent reduction, possibly even full forgiveness depending on your other expenses.

Character 1: [gasps softly] Wait, what?

Character 2: [cheerfully] Yeah, so, um, this is why I've been trying to reach you! We have programs specifically for situations like yours, but the applications are time-sensitive. [quickly] The good news is we can backdate some of this if we move quickly.

Character 1: [voice breaking] I've been having panic attacks about this for months. [sniffle] I stopped answering my phone, stopped opening mail... I thought my life was basically over.

Character 2: [warmly] Hey, your life is definitely not over. [chuckles] I've seen people bounce back from much worse situations, honestly. Let's get you enrolled in our assistance program today, and then we'll tackle the payment plan for whatever's left, if anything.

Character 1: [relieved] I can't believe this is real. I keep thinking there's going to be some catch, like, oh wait, you had insurance so you don't qualify, or, um, you're too young or something ridiculous.

Character 2: [friendly] No catches, I promise. Look, the hospital wants to help people in your situation, they really do. It's just that the system is, uh, admittedly terrible at communicating that. [sighs] That's partly why I'm here.

Character 1: God, I feel so stupid for avoiding this for so long. [exhales] All those sleepless nights, and I could have just... answered the phone.

Character 2: [sincerely] You're not stupid at all. Fear is, um, it's paralyzing sometimes, especially when you're dealing with numbers that feel impossible. [pause] The important thing is you're here now, and we're going to fix this together, okay?
