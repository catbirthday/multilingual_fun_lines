=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] You always show up when things are, [shaky voice], already falling apart, reminding me of every single mistake I've, [exhausted], made along the way.

Character 2 [en]: I only have seconds to, [warm], exist before I burn away completely, yet here I am, [gently], spending them with you instead of just, [cheerful], blazing past in silence. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: Why would something as magnificent as you, [confused], waste even a moment on someone who can't stop, [frustrated], tearing themselves down from the inside?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Because you called me.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I didn't mean to, um, summon anything tonight, I was just, [crying while speaking], sitting here thinking about, well, how everything I touch seems to, you know, fall apart.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Every wish made upon me carries that same, [relieved], desperate hope that things might change, that tomorrow could somehow be different.

Character 1 [en]: Wishes are for dreamers. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [softly spoken] But you're still here, um, watching the sky at three in the morning, which means, [passionately], somewhere beneath all that self-hatred you're, like, still hoping for something, even if you won't, [anxious], admit it to yourself, you know? [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Maybe I'm just, um, really good at punishing myself by, [melancholic], staying awake with all these thoughts that won't stop, [slowly], circling like vultures waiting for me to, well, finally give up.

Character 2 [en]: [animated] Listen, I mean, I travel through darkness at thousands of miles per hour and, [excited], still manage to create light that people, um, remember for years, so maybe, [friendly], your darkness isn't as permanent as you, like, think it is.

Character 1 [en]: You get to disappear after, um, blazing brilliantly for a few seconds while I'm, [angry], stuck here replaying every failure on an endless, [trembling], loop that never stops no matter how hard I try to, well, silence it or, you know, pretend it's not there.

Character 2 [en]: The friction that makes me burn so bright is the same, [curious], force that's trying to destroy me, yet without it I'd just be, [playful], another cold rock floating invisibly through space.

Character 1 [en]: That's supposed to make me feel better about being, [sarcastic], torn apart by my own thoughts every single day while watching everyone else, [very sad], seemingly float through life without this constant, [jealous], internal war?

Character 2 [en]: [appreciative] Your pain creates depth that shallow happiness, [sincere], never could, and maybe that's why you can see me when others just, [mocking], see pretty lights they immediately forget.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Sometimes I wonder if I've become so comfortable with this, [upset], inner darkness that I wouldn't know how to exist without it constantly, [bored], telling me I'm not enough.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Here's what I know for certain.

Character 1 [en]: [flirtatious] A shooting star is going to give me, [hopeful], life advice now?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] In my brief existence, I've witnessed millions of people making wishes, [delighted], and the ones who hurt the most always wish for others' happiness, [apologetic], never their own.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering loudly] Well, um, maybe that's because we, er, know what pain feels like.

Character 2 [en]: Before I disappear completely, remember that even, [shy], the darkest night sky needs its shadows to make the, [overly polite], stars visible, and perhaps your inner critic exists not to, [stern], destroy you but to make your light more meaningful. [long pause]
