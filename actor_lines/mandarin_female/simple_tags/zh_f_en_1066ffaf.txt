=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] The voice message said you needed an emergency session tonight for some tracks, but I don't see any equipment or— [pause] Wait, I know you from somewhere.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] There aren't any tracks, Danny. [exhales] I just needed to see you and this was the only way I could think of that wouldn't make you run immediately.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Rebecca?

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Five years is a long time to disappear, I know. [sighs] But you have to understand that after what happened with Dad and the money, I couldn't face any of you.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] We thought you were dead, Becca. [frustrated] Mom had a funeral with an empty casket, spent her savings on private investigators, and you've been here in the city this whole time?

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Not the whole time, and not like you think. [very quietly] The first two years I was in Miami trying to start over, but when that fell apart, this work became my only option.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Your only option was selling yourself? [laughs bitterly] We would have helped you, I would have given you anything, but instead you chose this over your own family?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You don't understand what it's like to owe the wrong people money. [trembling] They don't care about your family connections or your pride, they just want their payment one way or another.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] How much do you owe? [pause] Whatever it is, we can figure it out together, just like we used to when we were kids and you'd get in trouble at school.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] This isn't detention or a broken window, Danny. [exhales] It's three hundred thousand dollars to people who break bones for being a day late on interest payments.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Jesus, Becca. [clearing throat] Look, the studio's been doing well, I have some savings, and if we set up a payment plan with whoever these people are—

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] Stop trying to save me like I'm still your little sister who needs protecting. [sniffles] That girl died somewhere between the third overdose and the first time I had to do this work.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] You're still my sister no matter what you've done or what's been done to you. [warmly] Remember when we used to mix tracks together in the garage, before everything got complicated?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] That was a different life, with different people. [sighs] You're looking at me like I'm still that sixteen-year-old girl with headphones around her neck and dreams about Berklee.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Mom still sets a place for you at dinner every Sunday. [pause] She says one day you'll walk through that door and she wants to be ready when you do.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Don't do this to me, Danny. [crying] I came here to say goodbye properly this time, not to get pulled back into a life I can't have anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] At least let me help with the money before you disappear again. [quickly] I can liquidate some equipment, take out loans, whatever it takes to keep you safe while we figure this out.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] You always were too good for this family, you know that? [long pause] Fine, but only the money, and after it's paid, I'm gone for good this time.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] We'll see about that. [sighs] Right now let's just focus on keeping you alive long enough to have that argument.

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] I missed you so much it physically hurt sometimes. [exhales] But missing someone and deserving them in your life are two very different things. [pause]
