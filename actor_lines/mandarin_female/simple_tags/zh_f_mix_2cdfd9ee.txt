=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] So this is what you've done with my life's work. [pause] 23年我把这个地方从一个废弃仓库做成了全市最受尊敬的厨房，结果你把它变成了什么分子料理的游乐场。

Character 2 [mix]: [condescending] Your life's work was gathering dust while you ran off to Europe. [chuckles] 总得有人救这个地方，不然就真成了你那些过时技术和法式料理的博物馆了。

Character 1 [mix]: [furious] Those techniques earned three Michelin stars, 那时候你连刀都还不会拿！[loudly] 你还在那个角落洗碗的时候，美食评论家说这里是美国高级餐饮的灵魂！

Character 2 [mix]: [mocking] And where are those stars now, chef? [pause] 你一走就全没了，整个团队没工资，没人管，什么解释都没有，就一个你到现在都不肯说的丑闻。

Character 1 [mix]: [very quietly] You know exactly why I left. 你心里清楚得很。

Character 2 [mix]: [stern] What I know is that you disappeared like a coward. [laughs] 你在波尔多喝酒毁掉名声的时候，我在这里重建一切，还债，不让你宝贵的遗产破产。

Character 1 [mix]: [shaky voice] Those debts were never mine, 都是投资人想把我赶走设的局！[exhales] 你跟他们是一伙的吧？那些你说在练刀工的晚上，其实都在跟Richardson和他的律师见面。

Character 2 [mix]: [over confidently] Prove it then. [pause] 你看，这就是你的问题——你总觉得所有人都在算计你，其实就是你自己撑不住了。

Character 1 [mix]: [frustrated] I thrived on pressure! [loudly] 20年来每一场服务都是我精确指挥的交响乐，你只不过是个碰巧在大家都回家后还在练习的小提琴手！

Character 2 [mix]: [coldly] One violin player who now owns the entire orchestra. [sighs] 你消失超过90天违反合同，董事会一致投票把所有权转给我了。

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] That contract was signed under duress, 他们拿我女儿的毒瘾问题威胁我。[pause] 但你早就知道了，是你告诉Richardson她进戒毒所的事。

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Your family problems weren't my responsibility! [quickly] 我在努力建立事业，而你在崩溃，取消服务，朝副主厨扔盘子，为了什么传统番茄不够传统对供应商大吼大叫！

Character 1 [mix]: [empathetically] I trained you, Marcus. [quietly] 你付不起房租的时候我给你饭吃，我外婆从里昂带来的每个技术都教给你了，每个供应商每个评论家我都介绍给你了。

Character 2 [mix]: [regretful] And I'm truly grateful for that. [exhales] 但感激不代表我要看着你毁掉我们一起建立的一切，而你还不肯承认自己有问题。

Character 1 [mix]: [passionately] We built together? 不，这是我用血汗，用烧伤的皮肤，用18小时工作日建起来的！[gasps] 你只是协助，学习，吸收，但你没有为这个厨房牺牲过婚姻，健康，理智！

Character 2 [mix]: [animated] I sacrificed plenty! 5年忍受你的爆脾气，你不可能的标准，你永远需要被崇拜的毛病！[laughs bitterly] 至少现在员工上班不用担心你今天是什么心情了。

Character 1 [mix]: [sarcastically] Oh yes, I'm sure they love working for someone who stole everything. [pause] 原来的团队有几个留下来的？最多两三个吧？

Character 2 [mix]: [triumphantly] None of them stayed, 但那是因为我带来了有眼光的人，懂现代料理的人！[speeding up] 我们现在订位排到3个月后，你最后两年可做不到！

Character 1 [mix]: [exhausted] You're right, the rumors killed our bookings. [sighs] 但那些人不是为了食物来的，Marcus——他们来看热闹，拍Instagram，等对面开了更新潮的店就跑了。

Character 2 [mix]: [confidently] Keep telling yourself that if it helps. [pause] 事实是我在你的基础上建了更好的东西，你太害怕去想象了，因为那意味着承认世界已经超越了你的古典训练。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [bitter] So this is what you've done with my life's work. [pause] Twenty-three years I spent building this place from a condemned warehouse into the most respected kitchen in the city, and you've turned it into some trendy molecular gastronomy playground.

Character 2: [condescending] Your life's work was gathering dust while you ran off to hide in Europe. [chuckles] Someone had to save this place from becoming a museum to your outdated techniques and your precious classical French methods.

Character 1: [furious] Outdated? [loudly] Those techniques earned three Michelin stars before you even knew how to hold a knife properly! You were washing dishes in that corner when food critics were calling this place the soul of American fine dining!

Character 2: [mocking] And where are those stars now, chef? [pause] They took them away the moment you abandoned ship, left your entire staff without paychecks, without guidance, without any explanation except some vague scandal you still won't talk about.

Character 1: [very quietly] You know why I left.

Character 2: [stern] What I know is that you disappeared like a coward when things got difficult. [laughs] While you were drowning your reputation in Bordeaux wine, I was here rebuilding everything, paying off your debts, keeping your precious legacy from bankruptcy.

Character 1: [shaky voice] My debts? Those were never my debts, they were planted by the investors who wanted me out! [exhales] You worked with them, didn't you? All those late nights you said you were practicing knife skills, you were actually meeting with Richardson and his lawyers.

Character 2: [over confidently] Prove it. [pause] See, that's your problem—you always thought everyone was plotting against you when really, you just couldn't handle the pressure of staying on top anymore.

Character 1: [frustrated] The pressure? I thrived on pressure! [loudly] Every service for two decades was a symphony I conducted with precision, and you were just one violin player who happened to practice while everyone else went home!

Character 2: [coldly] One violin player who now owns the entire orchestra. [sighs] The board of investors unanimously voted to transfer ownership after you violated your contract by disappearing without notice for more than ninety days.

Character 1: [trembling] That contract was signed under duress when I was being blackmailed about my daughter's addiction problems. [pause] But you already knew that too, since you're the one who told Richardson about her rehab stays.

Character 2: [defensive] Your family problems weren't my responsibility! [quickly] I was trying to build a career, and you were spiraling, canceling services, throwing plates at sous chefs, screaming at suppliers over heritage tomatoes that weren't heritage enough!

Character 1: [empathetically] I trained you, Marcus. [quietly] Fed you when you couldn't afford groceries, taught you every technique my grandmother brought from Lyon, introduced you to every supplier and critic who mattered in this business.

Character 2: [regretful] And I'm grateful for that, truly. [exhales] But gratitude doesn't mean I had to watch you destroy everything we built together while you battled demons you refused to even acknowledge existed.

Character 1: [passionately] We built? No, I built this with my blood and burned flesh and eighteen-hour days! [gasps] You assisted, you learned, you absorbed, but you didn't sacrifice your marriage, your health, your sanity for this kitchen!

Character 2: [animated] I sacrificed plenty! Five years working under your explosive temper, your impossible standards, your constant need to be worshipped! [laughs bitterly] At least now the staff comes to work without fear of what mood you'll be in.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh yes, I'm sure they love working for someone who stole their mentor's life work. [pause] How many of the original team stayed after you took over? Two? Three at most?

Character 2: [triumphantly] None of them stayed, but that's because I brought in people with vision, with understanding of modern cuisine! [speeding up] We're booked solid for three months out, something you couldn't claim in your last two years here!

Character 1: [exhausted] You're right, the bookings dried up when the rumors started. [sighs] But those people aren't coming for the food, Marcus—they're coming for the spectacle, the Instagram moments, the novelty that will fade the moment something shinier opens across town.

Character 2: [confidently] Keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep. [pause] The reality is that I've taken your foundation and built something extraordinary on top of it, something you were too afraid to even imagine because it meant admitting the world had moved beyond your classical training.
