Scenario: A celebrity lookalike arrives at a graphic design studio to commission a portfolio website, only to discover the designer is their estranged sibling.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So the agency said you were the best designer for portfolio sites, especially for people in entertainment, and I need something that really captures what I do without being too—wait, Sam? Is that really you?

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Five years since you walked into any room I was in, and now you show up at my studio because you need a website for your lookalike business? [bitter] This is exactly the kind of cosmic joke I should have expected.

Character 1 [en]: [defensively] I didn't know this was your studio—the booking was under a company name, not your personal one. [pause] Besides, you're the one who disappeared to Brooklyn without telling anyone where you were going or what you were doing.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] You mean I left after mom and dad spent three hours at thanksgiving dinner explaining how impersonating celebrities was more valuable than my master's degree in design. [sarcastically] Sorry I didn't send a forwarding address.

Character 1 [en]: That's not fair.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] Fair would have been you defending me once, just once, instead of sitting there while they compared my student loans to your appearance fees. [exhales] But here we are, and you need a website, so let's just be professional about this.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Professional? You want to talk about professional when you blocked my number, ignored every email I sent trying to apologize, and now you're acting like I'm just another client walking through your door?

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] You are just another client because that's the only relationship that makes sense anymore. [very quietly] The sister I knew wouldn't have built her entire career on looking like someone else instead of being herself.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] You think I wanted this? You think I planned to make forty thousand a month because I happen to have the same bone structure as some actress who won three Emmys? [laughs bitterly] Life doesn't always go according to our artistic vision, Sam.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically] Forty thousand a month, must be really tough for you. [sighs] Meanwhile, I'm building websites for people pretending to be other people, so maybe we're both sellouts in our own special ways.

Character 1 [en]: Stop it. Just stop.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Look, if you want the website, I'll build it—my work speaks for itself regardless of our history. [hesitantly] But don't pretend we're going to fix five years of silence over a design consultation.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Remember when we were kids and you'd draw these elaborate portraits of me as different characters—astronauts, pirates, CEOs? [very quietly] You always said I could be anyone I wanted to be.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Yeah, well, I meant you could pursue any career, not literally become a professional doppelganger. [pause] Though I suppose there's something poetic about you finally taking my advice literally.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Sam, I've been sending thirty percent of everything I make to pay off your student loans through an anonymous donation program at your old school—did you know that? Did you ever wonder why your balance kept dropping?

Character 2 [en]: [confused] What? No, that's impossible, those payments are from a scholarship fund for graduate students who—[gasps] oh my god, you created a fake scholarship fund? [very quietly] Why would you do that?

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Because you're my sister and you left because of money, because of the comparisons, because I was making more than you without trying. [firmly] So I tried to fix it the only way I knew how.

Character 2 [en]: I didn't leave because of money.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Then why did you leave? Because every reason you've given me today, every bitter comment, it all comes back to the money, to the career, to everything except what really happened that night.

Character 2 [en]: We don't talk about that. [long pause]
