Scenario: A veterinary surgeon confronts their estranged twin who has been impersonating them at their practice, treating patients without a license while they were away at a conference.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Marcus, what the hell were you doing in my clinic while I was at the conference? [exhales] Mrs. Patterson called me saying you performed surgery on her cat, and I need to know exactly what you've done.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] Well, hello to you too, brother. [chuckles] I mean, technically speaking, the surgery went perfectly fine, the cat's recovering beautifully, so I'm not really sure what you're so upset about.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] You don't have a license, Marcus! You dropped out of vet school after two semesters to, what was it, pursue your entrepreneurial ventures? [voice rising] You could've killed that animal!

Character 2 [en]: [dismissively] Oh please, I watched you do that exact procedure dozens of times when we were kids helping Dad at his practice. [sighs] Besides, I've been reading all your textbooks, watching surgical videos, honestly I'm probably more prepared than half your staff.

Character 1 [en]: [frantically] Reading textbooks? Are you actually insane? [gasps] How many other animals did you treat while I was gone, and don't you dare lie to me about this.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Mmm, let's see, there was the Patterson cat obviously, um, then a couple routine vaccinations, nothing major really. [clearing throat] Oh, and that German Shepherd with the infected wound, but that was basically just cleaning and antibiotics. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [furious] A couple? Jesus Christ, Marcus, you could've destroyed everything I've built here! [exhales sharply] My reputation, my practice, eight years of work because you wanted to play doctor for a weekend?

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] Actually, your clients loved me, said I had better bedside manner than you do. [laughs] Mrs. Chen even brought me homemade dumplings because I spent extra time explaining her rabbit's dietary needs.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] You used my DEA number to order controlled substances, didn't you? That's why the pharmacy called about unusual ordering patterns. [shaky voice] Tell me you didn't forge prescriptions with my license number.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Look, there were some emergencies, okay? [nervously] That Golden Retriever was in legitimate pain, I couldn't just let it suffer, and technically the prescriptions weren't forged since, you know, we have the same signature. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: [extremely upset] The same signature? We haven't had the same signature since we were twelve years old practicing Mom's name on permission slips! [voice breaking] How long have you been planning this, Marcus?

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Three months.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Three months? You've been planning to impersonate me at my own clinic for three months? [anxiously] What else have you done, because this feels like more than just wanting to help some animals.

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] Alright, so there might be a woman involved, Sarah from the pet supply company who, uh, thinks she's been dating you for the past month. [sighs heavily] She's really sweet, loves animals, makes incredible lasagna. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] You've been dating someone as me? Marcus, this is identity theft, fraud, malpractice, and God knows what else! [gasps] I could lose my license, go to prison because of your twisted games!

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Twisted games?

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Yes, twisted games, like when we were kids and you'd take my tests, date my girlfriends, apply to colleges in my name. [exhales] Except now it's not just detention or getting grounded, it's my entire life you're destroying.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] You know what? I actually helped those animals, every single one of them is better off because I was here. [quietly] Maybe I don't have the degree, but I have the same instincts you do, the same hands, the same everything except the piece of paper.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The piece of paper represents eight years of training, Marcus, residencies, board exams, thousands of hours of supervised practice. [sighs deeply] You can't just download that from YouTube and expect to be qualified to cut into living creatures.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] But I did it, didn't I? [chuckles softly] And they're all fine, better than fine actually, because unlike you, I had time to actually listen to the owners, to care about more than just billable hours and getting to the next appointment.
