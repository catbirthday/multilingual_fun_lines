Scenario: A chemical plant operator discovers a lone wolf survivalist has been secretly living in the abandoned section of the facility, monitoring chemical runoff that the company has been covering up.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [firmly] 你一直都住在旧加工区那边，对吧？[pause] 保安在废弃储罐后面发现了你的营地，你采集的那些水样跟我们内部测试记录完全吻合。

Character 2 [pure]: [monotone] 6个月了。

Character 1 [pure]: 辐射检测片，到处散落的pH试纸——你完全知道什么东西正渗入地下水，而且你在记录这一切。

Character 2 [pure]: [bitter] 你们公司已经连续倾倒甲基汞化合物整整3年了。[quietly] 我有17个不同地点的土壤样本，污染水平全都能让这地方立马关门。

Character 1 [pure]: [hesitantly] 管理层一直跟我们说新的过滤系统能处理所有问题，说我们符合EPA的每一项标准。[exhales] 可是我晚上监测的流量数据，到早上报告的时候就对不上了。

Character 2 [pure]: [sarcastic] 呵，符合标准——他们游说国会后自己制定的标准。[firmly] 通往镇上水库的那条小溪已经出现死亡区了，隔一周就有鱼群死亡，却从来上不了新闻。

Character 1 [pure]: [anxious] 我也追踪了几个月排放记录里那些异常数据，看着数字在季度报告前神秘地被调整。[very quietly] 下班后开始自己测量读数，存在家里的硬盘上。

Character 2 [pure]: [curious] 你怎么不举报？[pause] 你在这厂里干了20年，养老金还没拿到，还得养孩子——我理解——但你眼睁睁看着他们毒害整个流域啊。

Character 1 [pure]: [frustrated] 向谁举报？[sighs] 跟我们CEO每周日一起打高尔夫的安全检查员，还是那个全是前化工业高管的监管委员会？

Character 2 [pure]: [firmly] 有记者会为这种新闻疯狂的，有环保组织的律师是真的在乎这些事。[speeding up] 但他们需要内部人士，需要懂技术数据、能验证我记录内容的人。

Character 1 [pure]: [quietly] 我女儿的幼儿园就在下游3英里，什么都用井水。[shaky voice] 每次我填那些造假报告时，都会想她的水杯里可能有什么。

Character 2 [pure]: [empathetically] 那就帮我阻止这一切。[firmly] 我收集的证据足够把他们埋了，但如果有亲眼见证掩盖真相的操作员作证，这案子就铁板钉钉了。

Character 1 [pure]: 他们会毁了我的——全国每家化工厂都会把我拉黑，确保我再也进不了这行。

Character 2 [pure]: 反正这行业已经在毁掉其他一切了——水源、土壤，要是检测一下，镇上一半人的健康可能都有问题。[bitter] 至少你还能活着找新工作。

Character 1 [pure]: [slowly] 你在一个被污染的设施里睡了6个月，就为了收集这些证据。[pause] 这要么是难以置信的勇敢，要么就是完全疯了，说实话我真分不清。

Character 2 [pure]: [chuckle] 可能两样都有吧。[very sincerely] 但总得有人做这件事，而且我已经没有家人需要担心了，自从两年前癌症带走我妻子之后——就是我们搬到一个跟这里一样的工厂附近后得的癌症。

Character 1 [pure]: [softly] 天哪。

Character 2 [pure]: [firmly] 我在《纽约时报》有个联系人，他追踪化工业违规已经10年了。[quietly] 一个电话这事就能曝光，但如果有内部人士愿意公开作证，影响力会大得多。

Character 1 [pure]: [deep breath] 夜班人少，我离开几个小时不会有人注意。[hesitantly] 把你收集的所有东西都给我看看，每个样本，每个读数——如果真像你说的那么严重，也许我是该停止当懦夫了。

Character 2 [pure]: [relieved] 证据分别存在3个不同地点，以防他们发现其中一处。[pause] 我们先从溢流管的汞读数开始——光这一项，如果操作得当，就足够触发联邦调查了。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [firmly] You've been living in the old processing wing this whole time, haven't you? [pause] Security found your camp behind the decommissioned tanks, and those water samples you've been collecting match our internal testing logs.

Character 2: [monotone] Six months now.

Character 1: The radiation badges, the pH strips scattered everywhere—you know exactly what's leaking into the groundwater, and you're documenting it all.

Character 2: [bitter] Your company's been dumping methylmercury compounds for three years straight. [quietly] I've got soil samples from seventeen different locations, all showing contamination levels that would shut this place down instantly.

Character 1: [hesitantly] Management keeps telling us the new filtration system handles everything, that we're compliant with every EPA standard. [exhales] But the flow rates I monitor at night don't match what gets reported in the morning.

Character 2: [sarcastic] Compliant with standards they wrote themselves after lobbying Congress. [firmly] The creek that feeds the town reservoir is already showing dead zones, fish kills every other week that somehow never make the news.

Character 1: [anxious] I've been tracking those same anomalies in our discharge logs for months, watching numbers get mysteriously adjusted before quarterly reports. [very quietly] Started taking my own readings after my shift ends, storing them on a drive at home.

Character 2: [curious] Why didn't you report it? [pause] You've got twenty years at this plant, pension on the line, kids to feed—I get it—but you're watching them poison an entire watershed.

Character 1: [frustrated] Report it to who exactly? [sighs] The safety inspector who golf's with our CEO every Sunday, or the regulatory board that's staffed with former chemical industry executives?

Character 2: [firmly] There are journalists who'd kill for this story, environmental groups with lawyers who actually give a damn. [speeding up] But they need someone on the inside, someone who understands the technical data and can verify what I've been documenting.

Character 1: [quietly] My daughter's daycare is three miles downstream from here, uses well water for everything. [shaky voice] Every time I fill out those falsified reports, I think about what might be in her drinking cup.

Character 2: [empathetically] Then help me stop it. [firmly] I've got enough evidence to bury them, but testimony from an actual operator who's seen the cover-up firsthand would make this bulletproof.

Character 1: They'll destroy me—blacklist me from every chemical plant in the country, make sure I never work in this industry again.

Character 2: The industry's already destroying everything else—the water, the soil, probably half the town's health if we tested for it. [bitter] At least you'd still be alive to find new work.

Character 1: [slowly] You've been sleeping in a contaminated facility for six months just to gather this evidence. [pause] That's either incredibly brave or completely insane, and I honestly can't tell which.

Character 2: [chuckle] Both, probably. [very sincerely] But someone had to do it, and I don't have a family to worry about anymore, not since the cancer took my wife two years ago—cancer that started right after we moved near a plant just like this one.

Character 1: [softly] Jesus.

Character 2: [firmly] I've got a contact at the Times who's been following chemical industry violations for a decade. [quietly] One phone call and this whole thing breaks wide open, but it would mean more with an insider willing to go on record.

Character 1: [deep breath] The nightshift skeleton crew won't notice if I'm gone for a few hours. [hesitantly] Show me everything you've collected, every sample, every reading—if it's as bad as you say, then maybe it's time I stopped being a coward.

Character 2: [relieved] The evidence is stored in three different locations in case they find one stash. [pause] We start with the mercury readings from the overflow pipe—that alone is enough to trigger a federal investigation if we play this right.
