=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [犹豫地] 你戴的那顶帽子——那个酒红色的钟形帽，带丝带装饰的——我记得是...大概六个月前做的，是给肿瘤科捐赠的。[停顿] 在财务办公室看到它，感觉挺...挺意外的。

Character 2 [pure]: 你就是Margaret's Millinery的Margaret！[兴奋地] 这顶帽子给我妹妹带来了很大的安慰——她说即使在最难熬的治疗期间，戴着它也让她觉得自己很优雅。

Character 1 [pure]: 其实我来这儿是想申请你们的分级收费项目。[轻声地] 说来讽刺，我一直在给病人做帽子，却逃避面对自己的诊断。

Character 2 [pure]: [温暖地] 那我们来办理一下吧——这里不会有人评判你的，大家都有自己延误治疗的原因。[停顿] 你的收入证明显示你是自雇，这个情况处理起来会稍微复杂一点。

Character 1 [pure]: [焦虑地] 我的生意...自从我捐的比卖的多以后就一直在苦撑——原来把最好的作品都送出去是付不起医药费的。[叹气] 但是看到病人找到心仪的帽子时露出的笑容，我就是...就是停不下来。

Character 2 [pure]: [温柔地] 根据你去年的税单，你符合第三档的标准，可以减免70%的费用。不过我注意到你最近几个月收入下降很多——我们应该用现在的数字重新算一下。

Character 1 [pure]: [如释重负] 70%能帮大忙了，虽然...说出来挺不好意思的，我拖了这么久。[颤抖的声音] 肿块已经在那儿好几个月了，但不知怎么的，给其他经历这个的人做帽子，比面对自己的状况要...要容易些。

Character 2 [pure]: [同情地] 这种情况比你想的常见——照顾别人的人、帮助他人的人往往会忽略自己。[停顿] 让我根据你现在的月收入调整一下，这样的话你其实符合第二档，可以减免85%。

Character 1 [pure]: [惊讶地] 我没想到财务办公室会这么善解人意——通常这种对话都很冷冰冰的，公事公办的。[声音哽咽] 你把我当成一个人来对待，而不只是又一个要处理的案例。

Character 2 [pure]: [真诚地] 每个走进这扇门的人都有自己的故事，而你的故事已经感动了这里几百个病人。[温暖地] 我妹妹把收到你帽子的病友写的每一张感谢卡都保存着——她管那些叫她的"勇气收藏"。

Character 1 [pure]: [哭着说] 我开始做帽子是在我妈妈五年前因脑癌去世之后——她很讨厌医院的帽子让她感觉像个...像个病号。[停顿] 我做的每顶帽子都承载着她精神的一部分。

Character 2 [pure]: [轻声地] 你介意我加急处理你的申请，让你这周就能看诊吗？[停顿] 肿瘤科周四早上有个空档，我今天可以亲自把你的材料送过去。

Character 1 [pure]: [感激地] 周四太好了——我周三之前要完成三个儿科病房的定制订单。[轻笑] 即使面对这个，我还是停不下来给别人做帽子。

Character 2 [pure]: [温暖地] 千万别停。

Character 1 [pure]: [好奇地] 你妹妹——她想要一顶定制的吗？[快速地] 我很想专门为她做一顶，反映她的个性而不是...不只是她的病情。

Character 2 [pure]: [感动地] 她一直很喜欢你做的孔雀羽毛设计，但以为那些只接受特别订单。[激动地] 这对她来说意义重大——她把这顶酒红色的戴得太频繁，都有点旧了。

Character 1 [pure]: [热情地] 孔雀羽毛配上青绿色的丝绸和珍珠装饰——我脑子里已经有画面了。[停顿] 给我两周时间，我会做出让她感觉像女王而不是病人的帽子。

Character 2 [pure]: [感激地] 给。

Character 1 [pure]: [困惑地] 这是第一档的分类——那是95%的减免。[轻声地] 但我的收入符合第二档，你刚才自己说的。

Character 2 [pure]: [坚定地] 我把你的慈善捐赠当作经营成本重新算了，它们确实是，还考虑了你工作的社区服务价值。[微笑着说] 有时候这个分级标准就该向已经付出这么多的人倾斜。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [犹豫地] That hat you're wearing—the burgundy cloche with the silk ribbon detail—I made that one about six months ago for the oncology ward donations. [停顿] Strange to see it here in the financial office.

Character 2: You're Margaret from Margaret's Millinery! [兴奋地] This hat has been such a comfort during my sister's treatments—she says it makes her feel elegant even on the hardest days.

Character 1: I'm actually here because I need to apply for your sliding scale program myself. [轻声地] The irony isn't lost on me that I've been making hats for patients while avoiding my own diagnosis.

Character 2: [温暖地] Let's get you sorted out then—no judgment here, we all have our reasons for delaying care. [停顿] Your income verification shows you're self-employed, which can make this process a bit more complex.

Character 1: [焦虑地] My business has been struggling since I started donating more than I sell—turns out giving away your best work doesn't pay the medical bills. [叹气] But seeing patients smile when they find the perfect hat makes it impossible to stop.

Character 2: [温柔地] Based on your tax returns from last year, you'd qualify for our tier three pricing, which reduces costs by seventy percent. But I'm noticing your income has dropped significantly in recent months—we should recalculate using current figures.

Character 1: [如释重负] Seventy percent would help enormously, though I'm embarrassed to admit how much I've been putting this off. [颤抖的声音] The lumps have been there for months, but somehow making hats for other people going through this felt easier than facing it myself.

Character 2: [同情地] That's more common than you'd think—caregivers and people who help others often neglect themselves. [停顿] Let me adjust these numbers based on your current monthly income, which would actually qualify you for tier two at eighty-five percent reduction.

Character 1: [惊讶地] I didn't expect such understanding from a financial office—usually these conversations feel so clinical and detached. [声音哽咽] You're treating me like a person, not just another case number to process.

Character 2: [真诚地] Every person who walks through that door has a story, and yours has literally touched hundreds of patients here. [温暖地] My sister keeps every thank-you card from other patients who've received your hats—she calls them her courage collection.

Character 1: [哭着说] I started making the hats after my mother passed from brain cancer five years ago—she hated how the hospital caps made her feel institutional. [停顿] Each hat I make carries a little piece of her spirit forward.

Character 2: [轻声地] Would you be comfortable if I expedited your application to get you seen this week? [停顿] The oncology team has an opening Thursday morning, and I can personally walk your paperwork through today.

Character 1: [感激地] Thursday would be perfect—I have three custom orders to finish by Wednesday for the pediatric ward. [轻笑] Even facing this, I can't seem to stop making hats for others.

Character 2: [温暖地] Never stop.

Character 1: [好奇地] Your sister—would she like a custom piece? [快速地] I'd love to make something specifically for her, something that reflects her personality rather than just her diagnosis.

Character 2: [感动地] She's always admired the peacock feather designs you do, but thought those were only for special orders. [激动地] This would mean the world to her—she's been wearing this burgundy one so much it's starting to show wear.

Character 1: [热情地] Peacock feathers with maybe some teal silk and pearl accents—I can see it already. [停顿] Give me two weeks and I'll have something that makes her feel like royalty, not a patient.

Character 2: [感激地] Here.

Character 1: [困惑地] This is a tier one classification—that's ninety-five percent coverage. [轻声地] But my income qualifies for tier two, you said so yourself earlier.

Character 2: [坚定地] I recalculated using your charitable donations as business expenses, which they are, and factored in the community service value of your work. [微笑着说] Sometimes the sliding scale slides in favor of people who've already given so much.
