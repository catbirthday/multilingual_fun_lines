Making up stories about why my hands were so rough, why I knew exactly when tomatoes were ripe just by touching them. [pause] I remember being, um... being fourteen and this girl at school asked why my mom's English was so broken and I said she was studying abroad, not that she'd been picking strawberries since she was nine. [regretful] Such bullshit.\n\nAnd now look at me. [laugh] The food critics can't stop raving about my \"authentic connection to the land\" and my \"generational farming wisdom.\" [sarcastic] Yeah, generational wisdom from people they would've called backwards. \n\nI mean, everything on that menu—everything—is what we ate because we couldn't afford anything else. [increasingly passionate] Pickled vegetables because we had to preserve them. Bone broths because we used every single part of the animal. Wild herbs because, well, they were free. \n\n[warm] My grandmother would've laughed so hard seeing people pay forty dollars for her poverty meals. [pause] Actually no, she would've been... I think she would've been proud. [emotional] Really proud that I'm not—that I'm finally not ashamed anymore. [quietly] That it all meant something."
