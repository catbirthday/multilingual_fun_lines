=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [bitter] 他们说是陈列的问题。[pause] 我的陈列。[sigh] 好像我靠几个模特儿和橱窗设计就能搞垮整间店似的。[frustrated] 我是说，好吧，行，那个夏季系列的事儿是...呃，那个是挺糟的。[quietly] 10月份摆泳装，我懂。[defensive] 但他们批准了啊！[voice shaking] 他们看了我的方案说"可以做"，现在突然全变成我的错了？[long pause]

[anxious] 不过...嗯，也许他们说得对。[sad] 我那个节日陈列之后的客流量，那个...数据挺惨的。[regretful] 掉了20%。[sniffle] 而且我还一直坚持说我们要更前卫一点，更，怎么说呢，艺术化？[mumbling] 人家街对面的Target就是...老老实实卖东西。[pause]

[crying while speaking] 32个人要失业了。[gasp softly] 就因为我以为自己是什么，零售界的毕加索？[very sad] 配饰部的Sarah，她有三个孩子。[voice breaking] 还有Marcus，他刚...刚买了房。[cry]

[anxious] Except... hmm, maybe they're right. [sad] The foot traffic numbers after my holiday display were, um... they were pretty devastating. [regretful] Twenty percent drop. [sniffle] And I kept insisting we needed to be more avant-garde, more, I don't know, artistic? [mumbling] While Target down the street was just... selling things. [pause]

[crying while speaking] Thirty-two people are losing their jobs. [gasp softly] Because I thought I was some kind of, what, retail Picasso? [very sad] Sarah from accessories, she's got three kids. [voice breaking] And Marcus, he just... he just bought a house. [cry] 

[exhausted] My contract ends Friday. [very quietly] The store closes next month. [trailing off] And every time I walk past those stupid windows I designed, I just...
