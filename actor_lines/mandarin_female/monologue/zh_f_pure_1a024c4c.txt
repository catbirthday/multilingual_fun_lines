=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [anxious] 那个...我在这儿坐了都快一个小时了，就一直在想Sarah的事儿。[sigh] 就是说，嗯...她昨天说了句特别伤人的话，我觉得她根本都没意识到。[confused] 不是，你跟别人说人家的梦想"不现实"，这不是...怎么说呢，这不是很打击人嘛？[frustrated] 最糟糕的是，其他人就坐在那儿点头附和。[pause] 没一个人说话。[very quietly] 我觉得自己特别渺小。

[angry] 不过你知道吗？我真的累了，老是我一个人在那儿理解别人。[bitter] 她从来不道歉，就会说那种"哎呀，你又敏感了"。[mocking] "你又敏感了。"[groan] 天哪，我最烦她这么说了。

[sad] 但是吧，想到我们一起经历的那些美好时光，我就...[trailing off] 我不知道自己是不是真的准备好失去这段友谊了。[hesitantly] 也许我可以，嗯，再试着跟她谈一次？[hopeful] 把话说开，你懂吧？[pause] 告诉她，她这样否定我的目标让我有多难受。[slowly] 或者说了也没用。[exhausted] 说实话，我真的累了，老在脑子里反复想这些事。[resigned] 可能有些友谊就是会走到尽头吧。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [anxious] So I've been sitting here for like an hour trying to figure out what to do about Sarah. [sigh] The thing is, um... she said something really hurtful yesterday and I don't think she even realizes it. [confused] Like, how do you not know that telling someone their dreams are "unrealistic" is, I don't know, crushing? [frustrated] And the worst part is everyone else was just sitting there nodding along. [pause] Nobody said anything. [very quietly] I felt so small.

[angry] You know what though? I'm tired of always being the one who has to be understanding. [bitter] She never apologizes for anything, just does that thing where she's like "oh, you're being sensitive again." [mocking] "You're being sensitive." [groan] God, I hate when she says that.

[sad] But then I remember all the good times we've had and I just... [trailing off] I don't know if I'm ready to lose that. [hesitantly] Maybe I could, um, try talking to her one more time? [hopeful] Really lay it out there, you know? [pause] Tell her how it makes me feel when she dismisses my goals like that. [slowly] Or maybe that's pointless. [exhausted] Honestly, I'm just so tired of having this same conversation in my head. [resigned] Maybe some friendships just run their course.
