=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [苦涩地] 他们说是陈列的问题。[停顿] 我的陈列。[叹气] 好像我靠几个模特儿和橱窗设计就能搞垮整间店似的。[沮丧地] 我是说，好吧，行，那个夏季系列的事儿是...呃，那个是挺糟的。[轻声地] 10月份摆泳装，我懂。[防备地] 但他们批准了啊！[声音颤抖] 他们看了我的方案说"可以做"，现在突然全变成我的错了？[长停顿]

[焦虑地] 不过...嗯，也许他们说得对。[悲伤地] 我那个节日陈列之后的客流量，那个...数据挺惨的。[懊悔地] 掉了20%。[抽鼻子] 而且我还一直坚持说我们要更前卫一点，更，怎么说呢，艺术化？[咕哝着] 人家街对面的Target就是...老老实实卖东西。[停顿]

[哭着说] 32个人要失业了。[轻声倒吸气] 就因为我以为自己是什么，零售界的毕加索？[非常悲伤] 配饰部的Sarah，她有三个孩子。[声音哽咽] 还有Marcus，他刚...刚买了房。[哭]

[沮丧地] I mean, yeah, okay, the summer collection thing was... erhm, that was bad. [轻声地] The beachwear in October, I get it. [防备地] But they approved it! [声音颤抖] They looked at my plans and said "go ahead" and now suddenly it's all my fault? [长停顿] 

[焦虑地] Except... hmm, maybe they're right. [悲伤地] The foot traffic numbers after my holiday display were, um... they were pretty devastating. [懊悔地] Twenty percent drop. [抽鼻子] And I kept insisting we needed to be more avant-garde, more, I don't know, artistic? [咕哝着] While Target down the street was just... selling things. [停顿]

[哭着说] Thirty-two people are losing their jobs. [轻声倒吸气] Because I thought I was some kind of, what, retail Picasso? [非常悲伤] Sarah from accessories, she's got three kids. [声音哽咽] And Marcus, he just... he just bought a house. [哭] 

[疲惫地] My contract ends Friday. [非常轻声] The store closes next month. [声音渐弱] And every time I walk past those stupid windows I designed, I just...
