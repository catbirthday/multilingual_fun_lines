            "content": "[very excited] Oh my God, I can't believe it actually worked! [pause] Marcus just won his first tournament—his FIRST tournament! [extremely happy] And the ball, the way it hooked exactly where he needed it to, despite his, um... his limited wrist rotation. [warm] You know, when he first came to me, everyone said it couldn't be done. [frustrated] They were like \"how's he gonna get the revs without full arm mobility?\" [passionately] But I kept thinking, there's gotta be a way, right? [chuckle] So I drilled the finger holes at this really specific angle—actually, it was more like seventeen different micro-adjustments. [confidently] The thumb pitch had to be perfect, absolutely perfect, or he'd drop it. [sniffle] And when I watched him today, God, when he threw that strike in the tenth frame... [pause] I mean, the crowd just erupted. [very sincerely] His mom was crying, his physical therapist was crying, hell, I was— [laugh] I was definitely crying. [softly] You spend all these years drilling holes in balls, thinking you're just, I don't know, making equipment. [gasp softly] But then something like this happens and you realize... [trailing off] sometimes you're drilling hope. [very quietly] Sometimes you're drilling dreams into reality."
