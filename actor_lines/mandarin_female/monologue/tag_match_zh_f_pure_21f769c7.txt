=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [困惑地] 等等，这个收购文件上的名字... Davidson创意方案？不可能— [停顿] 我的天。[轻声地] Tommy Davidson。就是那个—就是雪松街的Tommy。[紧张地笑] 这是他的公司？我们马上要拆分贱卖的那家？[沮丧地] 当然了。当然我第一次主导的项目，就是要，呃...就是要毁掉我发小的心血。[苦涩地] 天哪，我什么时候变成这种人了？我们以前还在他家后院搭秘密基地，一起幻想以后开公司呢。[懊悔地] 结果现在我穿着西装，为了季度收益把他的梦想撕得粉碎。[长停顿] 合伙人明天要我的报告。他们才不在乎他教我骑自行车，也不在乎他妈妈每周六给我们包饺子。[讽刺地] 就是又一家效率低下的小公司，对吧？模式过时，利润率差。[非常轻声] 我可以申请回避。说有利益冲突。[犹豫地] 但那样的话Johnson就会接手，而他比我还要— [声音渐弱] 比我还要心狠手辣，看来是这样。[叹气] 20年了，我们竟然这样重逢。我拿着我的报表，他却...他却要赌上一切。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [困惑地] Wait, this name on the acquisition docs... Davidson Creative Solutions? That can't be— [停顿] Oh my god. [轻声地] Tommy Davidson. Tommy from— from Cedar Street. [紧张地笑] This is his company? The one we're about to gut and sell off in pieces? [沮丧地] Of course it is. Of course the first deal I'm leading turns out to be, um... turns out to be destroying my oldest friend's life. [苦涩地] God, when did I become this person? We used to build forts in his backyard, dreaming about starting businesses together. [懊悔地] And now I'm the one in the suit, tearing his dream apart for quarterly earnings. [长停顿] The partners are expecting my report tomorrow. They don't care that he taught me to ride a bike, or that his mom made us sandwiches every Saturday. [讽刺地] Just another inefficient small business, right? Outdated model, poor margins. [非常轻声] I could recuse myself. Say there's a conflict. [犹豫地] But then Johnson gets the deal, and he's even more ruthless than— [声音渐弱] than I am, apparently. [叹气] Twenty years, and this is how we meet again. Me with my spreadsheets, him with his... with everything on the line.
