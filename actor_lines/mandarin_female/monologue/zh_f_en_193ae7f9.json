[warm] God, I remember sitting in your office that first day, completely overwhelmed. I had this mountain of debt and zero savings, and you just—you just laid out this plan like it was so simple. [chuckle] \"Trust the process,\" you kept saying. [slowly] And I did, even when it felt impossible. Even when I wanted to buy that stupid boat. [laugh loudly] Remember that? You talked me off that ledge real quick. [very sincerely] The discipline was hard, I'm not gonna lie. Watching friends take vacations while I was, uh, while I was meal prepping and driving that old Honda. But now? [pause] Now I wake up and I don't have to go anywhere I don't want to go.
