Speaker [en]: [bitter] They finally got him. Um, three years of wearing wires, meeting in parking garages at 2 AM, and they finally—I mean, Martinez is done. [laugh] Funny thing is, I thought I'd feel... I don't know, vindicated? But it's like, the whole time I'm testifying, [very sad] all these other cops are just staring at me like I'm the criminal. And honestly, half of them knew. They all fucking knew what he was doing—the bribes, the evidence tampering, [angry] everything—and they just, you know, looked the other way.

[long pause] 

So yeah, he's going to prison. Probably. Unless his lawyer finds some technicality because, well, that's how it always goes, right? [sarcastic] The system works. Except it doesn't. It's just—here's the thing, [very quietly] I thought I was doing the right thing. Like, genuinely believed that if I just... if I got proof, then justice would, er, happen. [frustrated] But watching them protect each other, seeing how they tried to bury my testimony, how they made ME look like the bad guy for not, what, staying silent? 

[exhausted] I can't even look at a badge anymore without feeling sick. Literally. They got their conviction but, [trailing off] I don't even know what I believe in anymore...
