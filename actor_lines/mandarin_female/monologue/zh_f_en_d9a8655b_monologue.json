[pause] I was the, uh, the car accident victim who came in with—God, I mean, they told me later I was basically dying when the ambulance brought me in. [emotional] Internal bleeding, collapsed lung, the whole thing was just... [trailing off]\n\n[warm] You probably don't even remember because I'm sure you save so many people, but like, [speeding up] you held my hand when I was terrified, and you kept telling me I was going to see my daughter graduate, and I did! [excited] She graduated last month! Pre-med, actually, because of you. [laugh] \n\nI know this is, er, kind of weird, me showing up at your hospital like this, [hesitantly] but the thing is, I needed to—I had to tell you that, [very sincerely] because of what you did that night, I got to be there for everything. Her prom, her college acceptance, all of it. [crying while speaking] You gave me my life back when I was literally dying on that table. [sniffle] So, anyway, I just... [happy] thank you doesn't even begin to cover it, but thank you."
