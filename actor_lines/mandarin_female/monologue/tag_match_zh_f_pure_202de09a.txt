=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: 天哪，Jake，我——[惊讶地] 我真的没想到你会这么说。[停顿] 没有没有，我没哭，我就是...[抽鼻子] 好吧，是有点哭了啦。[笑] 你刚才打电话来，我还以为你又要借我的卡车什么的，没想到——没想到是这个。[温暖地] 我当然要陪着你啊，你是我弟弟。我才不管什么"继"不"继"的，你知道的吧。[停顿] 你说我光是听你说话就帮了你很多？[非常真诚地] Jake，你那时候过得那么苦。我能怎么办，就这么看着吗？[激动地] 还记得那天晚上吗，凌晨2点的时候你带着那瓶威士忌出现在我家门口？[轻笑] 我们在门廊上坐到天亮，就那么聊着，也不知道都聊了些什么，反正什么都聊。[停顿] 我觉得我就是，嗯...做了个正常人该做的事。[哭着说] 别说了，你要让我彻底崩溃了。[抽鼻子] 听着，你能挺过来是因为你自己坚强，不是因为——[停顿] 好好好，我承认有点功劳。[笑] 但说真的，看到你又开心起来了？[如释重负] 这就是我想要的全部了。所有那些深夜电话，所有的纸巾，一切都值了。[温暖地] 你知道我永远都在的，对吧？永远都在。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: Oh my god, Jake, I— [惊讶地] I had no idea you felt that way. [停顿] No, no, I'm not crying, I'm just... [抽鼻子] okay maybe I'm crying a little. [笑] When you called just now I thought you were going to ask to borrow my truck again or something, not— not this. [温暖地] Of course I was there for you, you're my brother. I don't care about the "step" part, you know that. [停顿] You're telling me that me just listening helped? [非常真诚地] Jake, you were going through hell. What was I supposed to do, just watch? [激动地] Remember that night you showed up at like 2 AM with that bottle of whiskey? [轻笑] We sat on my porch until sunrise just talking about, I don't know, everything and nothing. [停顿] I thought I was just, um... being a decent human being. [哭着说] Stop it, you're gonna make me completely lose it here. [抽鼻子] Look, you got through it because you're strong, not because— [停顿] okay, okay, I'll take some credit. [笑] But seriously, seeing you happy again? [如释重负] That's all I wanted. That's worth every late night phone call, every box of tissues, everything. [温暖地] You know I'm always here, right? Always.
