Subject: Your snowmobile mechanic shop losing everything in a fire with no insurance coverage

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [颤抖的声音] 23年了。我...我开这个店都23年了。[停顿] 现在就—全没了。什么都没了。那些举升机，诊断设备，还有我给Miller修的那台老Arctic Cat... [苦涩地] 你知道最惨的是什么吗？我三个月前把保险停了。三个月前。我想着，呃...想着淡季过了就能补上。[笑] 天哪，我真是个白痴。

[愤怒地] 所有人都跟我说—"Jack，你得买保险啊，万一出事怎么办？"我还说，哎呀，不会出事的，我到处都放了灭火器。[叹气] 是啊。灭火器。凌晨3点墙里的电线起火，灭火器顶个屁用。

[非常悲伤] 我爸的工具都在里面。他给我开店时留下的那些。70年代的老Snap-On，那种...唉，现在根本造不出那种质量的了。[声音渐弱] 还有客人的雪地车，我得告诉12个人，他们的车现在都...烧成灰了。

[疲惫地] 我都不知道从哪儿开始。我是说，真的，当你奋斗了一辈子的东西就这么...[长停顿] 也许我该收手了。也许这就是老天爷告诉我，趁还能走得动，赶紧退出吧。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [颤抖的声音] Twenty-three years. That's... that's how long I've been building that shop. [停顿] And now it's just—it's gone. All of it. The lifts, the diagnostic equipment, that vintage Arctic Cat I was restoring for Miller... [苦涩地] You know what the worst part is? I let the insurance lapse. Three months ago. Thought I could, um... thought I could catch up after the slow season. [笑] God, I'm such an idiot.

[愤怒地] Everyone kept telling me—"Jack, you need coverage, what if something happens?" And I'd say, oh, nothing's gonna happen, I've got fire extinguishers everywhere. [叹气] Yeah. Fire extinguishers. Against an electrical fire that started in the walls at 3 AM.

[非常悲伤] My dad's tools were in there. The ones he gave me when I opened the place. Those old Snap-Ons from the seventies that... mmm, they don't even make them like that anymore. [声音渐弱] And the customer sleds, I have to tell twelve people their machines are just... ash now.

[疲惫地] I don't even know where to start. Like, literally, where do you even begin when everything you've worked for is just... [长停顿] Maybe I'm done. Maybe this is the universe saying get out while you can still walk away.
