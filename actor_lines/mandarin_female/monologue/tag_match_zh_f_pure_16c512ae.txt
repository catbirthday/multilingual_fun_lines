=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [极度忧郁] 我认识的每个人都...都在看到我会变成什么样子之后就消失了。三年了，三年来都是一个人吃午饭，假装不在乎别人过马路都要绕着我走。[停顿] 但是今天——天哪，今天真的不一样。[颤抖的声音] 那个小女孩被困在倒塌的脚手架下面，我就——我根本没多想。变化来得太快了。[加快] 前一秒我还是那个人人害怕的可怜虫，下一秒我就像举起什么都没有一样，把2吨重的金属抬了起来，把她拉出来，而其他人就站在那儿拿手机拍。[笑] 就是这双让我亲妈都会躲开的爪子，完美地切开了那些扭曲的钢梁。[轻声地] 她一点都不怕我。就抱着我的毛不撒手，我抱着她出来的时候。她妈妈一直哭，一直谢我，一直叫我英雄。[停顿] 英雄。我。那个在超市里大家都躲着走的怪物。[抽鼻子] 我觉得，嗯...我觉得吧，这个诅咒可能不只是诅咒。可能我一直以来的想法都错了。[充满希望地] 可能我们有些人注定要与众不同，因为这个世界需要我们这样。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [极度忧郁] Everyone I knew just... disappeared after they saw what I could become. Three years of eating lunch alone, pretending I didn't care when people crossed the street to avoid me. [停顿] But today—God, today was different. [颤抖的声音] That little girl was trapped under the collapsed scaffolding and I just—I didn't even think about it. The change happened so fast. [加快] One second I'm this pathetic guy everyone's afraid of, and the next I'm lifting two tons of metal like it's nothing, pulling her out while everyone else just stood there filming with their phones. [笑] The same claws that made my own mother flinch away from me, they cut through the twisted beams perfectly. [轻声地] She wasn't scared of me at all. Just grabbed onto my fur and held on tight while I carried her out. Her mom was crying, thanking me over and over, calling me a hero. [停顿] A hero. Me. The monster everyone avoids at the grocery store. [抽鼻子] I guess, um... I guess maybe this curse isn't just a curse after all. Maybe I've been looking at it all wrong. [充满希望地] Maybe some of us are meant to be different because the world needs us to be.
