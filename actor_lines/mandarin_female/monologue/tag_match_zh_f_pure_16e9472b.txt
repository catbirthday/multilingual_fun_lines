=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: 我在这条街上扫烟囱都20年了。整整20年。[苦涩地] 现在他们要在Martinez那个杂货店的地方开一个—那个叫什么来着—精品飞斧酒吧。[叹气] 问题是，我的生意从来没有这么好过，这个...怎么说呢，感觉哪里不对劲。这些新搬来的人，都要搞什么维多利亚风格翻新，还有那个，呃，原始砖砌壁炉，每个月都要清理。[困惑地] 我是说，我应该高兴才对，对吧？我的活儿都排到3月份了。可是陈太太上礼拜被迫搬走了—她在洗衣店楼上住了40年。[非常悲伤] 40年啊，现在那里要变成，呃...什么豪华单身公寓之类的。[停顿] 昨天有对夫妻，给了我300块小费。300块！[笑着] 就干了一个小时的活儿！我站在那儿就想，嗯，这比我爸当年干一个礼拜挣的都多。[懊悔地] 这些人连我名字都不知道，就叫我"扫烟囱的"。Rodriguez一家，Peterson一家，还有街角的老Jimmy—他们都记得我孩子的生日。[声音渐弱] 现在就是...我是说，钱是挺好的，但是...[长停顿] 天哪，我都认不出自己住的这条街了。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: Twenty years I've been sweeping chimneys on this block. Twenty years. [苦涩地] And now they're putting in a—what'd they call it—a boutique axe-throwing bar where Martinez's bodega used to be. [叹气] The thing is, my business has never been better, which is... I don't know, it feels wrong somehow. All these new people moving in with their Victorian renovations and their, um, their original brick fireplaces that need cleaning every month. [困惑地] Like, I should be happy, right? I'm booked solid through March. But Mrs. Chen got priced out last week—forty years she lived above the laundromat. [非常悲伤] Forty years, and now it's gonna be, err... luxury studios or whatever. [停顿] Yesterday this couple, they tipped me three hundred bucks. Three hundred! [笑着] For an hour's work! And I'm standing there thinking, hmm, that's more than my dad made in a week doing the same job. [懊悔地] These people don't even know my name, they just call me "the chimney guy." Rodriguez, the Petersons, old Jimmy from the corner—they all knew my kids' birthdays. [声音渐弱] Now it's just... I mean, the money's good but... [长停顿] Gosh, I don't even recognize my own street anymore.
