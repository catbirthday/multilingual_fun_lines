=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [焦虑地] 那个...我在这儿坐了都快一个小时了，就一直在想Sarah的事儿。[叹气] 就是说，嗯...她昨天说了句特别伤人的话，我觉得她根本都没意识到。[困惑地] 不是，你跟别人说人家的梦想"不现实"，这不是...怎么说呢，这不是很打击人嘛？[沮丧地] 最糟糕的是，其他人就坐在那儿点头附和。[停顿] 没一个人说话。[非常轻声] 我觉得自己特别渺小。

[愤怒地] 不过你知道吗？我真的累了，老是我一个人在那儿理解别人。[苦涩地] 她从来不道歉，就会说那种"哎呀，你又敏感了"。[嘲讽地] "你又敏感了。"[呻吟] 天哪，我最烦她这么说了。

[悲伤地] 但是吧，想到我们一起经历的那些美好时光，我就...[声音渐弱] 我不知道自己是不是真的准备好失去这段友谊了。[犹豫地] 也许我可以，嗯，再试着跟她谈一次？[充满希望地] 把话说开，你懂吧？[停顿] 告诉她，她这样否定我的目标让我有多难受。[缓慢地] 或者说了也没用。[疲惫地] 说实话，我真的累了，老在脑子里反复想这些事。[无奈地] 可能有些友谊就是会走到尽头吧。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [焦虑地] So I've been sitting here for like an hour trying to figure out what to do about Sarah. [叹气] The thing is, um... she said something really hurtful yesterday and I don't think she even realizes it. [困惑地] Like, how do you not know that telling someone their dreams are "unrealistic" is, I don't know, crushing? [沮丧地] And the worst part is everyone else was just sitting there nodding along. [停顿] Nobody said anything. [非常轻声] I felt so small.

[愤怒地] You know what though? I'm tired of always being the one who has to be understanding. [苦涩地] She never apologizes for anything, just does that thing where she's like "oh, you're being sensitive again." [嘲讽地] "You're being sensitive." [呻吟] God, I hate when she says that.

[悲伤地] But then I remember all the good times we've had and I just... [声音渐弱] I don't know if I'm ready to lose that. [犹豫地] Maybe I could, um, try talking to her one more time? [充满希望地] Really lay it out there, you know? [停顿] Tell her how it makes me feel when she dismisses my goals like that. [缓慢地] Or maybe that's pointless. [疲惫地] Honestly, I'm just so tired of having this same conversation in my head. [无奈地] Maybe some friendships just run their course.
