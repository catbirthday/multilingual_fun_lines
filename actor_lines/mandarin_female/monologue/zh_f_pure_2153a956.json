I mean, I see you all every morning but I never— I had no idea. [shaky voice] Mrs. Chen, you were in here just yesterday asking about the sourdough schedule and you didn't say anything! [laugh] And Tommy, you kept asking me weird questions about what flavors I like and I thought you were just, um, being your usual chatty self. [warm] This is chocolate with raspberry filling, isn't it? [very sincerely] That's my absolute favorite. How did you even know that? [pause] I mentioned it once like six months ago when we were talking about wedding cakes. [overwhelmed] You remembered. All of you remembered. [crying while speaking] I can't believe thirty people just sang happy birthday to me in the middle of my shift. My manager's looking at me like I orchestrated this whole thing— [laugh hard] No, Sandra, I promise I'm as shocked as you are! [sniffle] You know, some days this job is, um... it's rough. The early mornings, the cranky customers, the burns from the ovens. [warm] But then you all do something like this and suddenly I remember why I love being here. [very sincerely] You're not just customers, you're family. [cheerful] Okay, who wants the first slice?"
