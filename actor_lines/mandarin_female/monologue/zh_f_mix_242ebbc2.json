[pause] And now—God, this is so weird—now he's calling me a hero? [bitter] His mom literally sent me a thank you card. [laugh] Like an actual, physical card in the mail saying I'm \"an angel\" and they're \"forever grateful.\"\n\n[anxious] I keep thinking about how he used to... um, he used to call me \"pathetic\" for being on the swim team. [angry] Said I looked like a dying fish! And his friends would all laugh, you know? [sad] Every single practice, they'd be there making those, uh... those drowning noises at me. \n\n[confused] But when he went under at that party, everyone just froze. [quickly] Literally everyone just stood there filming with their phones, and I just—I didn't even think about it, I just jumped in. [sigh] Maybe it's muscle memory or whatever.\n\n[hesitantly] Now they all want to be friends? [sarcastic] Oh, suddenly I'm worth talking to. [upset] Rachel actually invited me to her birthday thing next week—Rachel who pretended I was invisible for three years! \n\n[very quietly] The really messed up part is... I think I might actually go. [confused] Is that pathetic? I saved someone's life and I'm still, like... still wanting their approval somehow? [frustrated] Ugh, I hate this."
