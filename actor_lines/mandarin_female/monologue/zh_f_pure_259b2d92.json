[short pause] But I went by Sarah's place yesterday and there's, um... there's another family living there now. [confused] Kids' bikes in the driveway, different curtains. [sadly] The coffee shop where we used to meet every Thursday? [pause] It's a juice bar now. [bitter] A fucking juice bar. [sigh] And Mark, he—well, he got married apparently. [very quietly] To someone I've never even heard of. [pause] I keep thinking about how I missed... I missed everything. [regretful] Mom's funeral, Sarah's wedding, my nephew learning to walk. [voice breaking] Seven years of birthdays and Christmases and just... regular Tuesday afternoons. [anxiously] Everyone's moved on, you know? [pause] Built these whole lives that don't have a space for me anymore. [hesitantly] And I get it, I do, but... hmm... it's like being a ghost at your own, uh, at your own wake or something. [very sad] They mourned me already. [long pause] So what am I supposed to do now? [confused] Just show up and say \"Hey, remember me?\" [trailing off] Like nothing happened..."
