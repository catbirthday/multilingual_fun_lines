=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: 他们签了。那个特赦令，我是说。[如释重负] 这次是真的了。[停顿] 七年了...七年来我一直东躲西藏的，用假名字住小旅馆，现在我终于——我终于能光明正大地走在街上了。[轻声地] 用我自己的名字。[短停顿] 但是我昨天去了Sarah家，那里，呃...现在住着另一家人。[困惑地] 门前停着小孩的自行车，窗帘也换了。[悲伤地] 我们以前每周四都去的那个咖啡店？[停顿] 现在变成果汁吧了。[苦涩地] 操，果汁吧。[叹气] 还有Mark，他——嗯，他结婚了，听说。[非常轻声] 跟一个我根本不认识的人。[停顿] 我一直在想...我错过了...我错过了太多东西。[懊悔地] 妈妈的葬礼，Sarah的婚礼，我侄子学走路。[声音哽咽] 七年的生日、圣诞节，还有那些...普普通通的周二下午。[焦急地] 大家都往前走了，你知道吧？[停顿] 都建立起了新的生活，里面已经没有我的位置了。[犹豫地] 我也理解，真的，但是...怎么说呢...就像在自己的，呃，在自己的葬礼上当鬼魂一样。[非常悲伤] 他们早就把我当死人哀悼过了。[长停顿] 那我现在该怎么办？[困惑地] 就这样出现说"嘿，还记得我吗？"[声音渐弱] 好像什么都没发生过...


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: They signed it. The pardon, I mean. [如释重负] It's actually real this time. [停顿] After seven years of... of looking over my shoulder, sleeping in motels under fake names, I can just—I can walk down a street again. [轻声地] Use my own name. [短停顿] But I went by Sarah's place yesterday and there's, um... there's another family living there now. [困惑地] Kids' bikes in the driveway, different curtains. [悲伤地] The coffee shop where we used to meet every Thursday? [停顿] It's a juice bar now. [苦涩地] A fucking juice bar. [叹气] And Mark, he—well, he got married apparently. [非常轻声] To someone I've never even heard of. [停顿] I keep thinking about how I missed... I missed everything. [懊悔地] Mom's funeral, Sarah's wedding, my nephew learning to walk. [声音哽咽] Seven years of birthdays and Christmases and just... regular Tuesday afternoons. [焦急地] Everyone's moved on, you know? [停顿] Built these whole lives that don't have a space for me anymore. [犹豫地] And I get it, I do, but... hmm... it's like being a ghost at your own, uh, at your own wake or something. [非常悲伤] They mourned me already. [长停顿] So what am I supposed to do now? [困惑地] Just show up and say "Hey, remember me?" [声音渐弱] Like nothing happened...
