=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [大声倒吸气] 天哪，你们——我真的——[哭着说] 太不可思议了。你们真的给我准备了蛋糕？[抽鼻子] 你们什么时候计划的啊？我是说，我每天早上都能见到你们，但我完全——一点都没察觉。[颤抖的声音] 陈阿姨，你昨天还在这儿问我酸面包的时间表呢，你一个字都没透露！[笑] 还有小Tommy，你一直问我些奇怪的问题，问我喜欢什么口味，我还以为你就是，呃，像平常一样爱聊天呢。[温暖地] 这是巧克力配覆盆子夹心，对不对？[非常真诚地] 这是我的最爱啊。你们怎么知道的？[停顿] 我记得6个月前我们聊婚礼蛋糕的时候，我就提过一次。[不知所措地] 你们居然记得。你们都记得。[哭着说] 我真不敢相信30个人刚刚在我上班的时候给我唱生日歌。我们经理看我的眼神好像觉得是我自己安排的——[大笑] 没有啦，Sandra，我发誓我跟你一样震惊！[抽鼻子] 你知道吗，有些时候这份工作，呃……真的很辛苦。一大早就要起床，遇到脾气不好的客人，还会被烤箱烫到。[温暖地] 但是你们做了这样的事，我突然就想起为什么我这么爱在这里工作了。[非常真诚地] 你们不只是顾客，你们是我的家人。[愉快地] 好啦，谁要吃第一块？


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [大声倒吸气] Oh my god, you guys— I can't— [哭着说] This is incredible. You actually got me a cake? [抽鼻子] When did you even plan this? I mean, I see you all every morning but I never— I had no idea. [颤抖的声音] Mrs. Chen, you were in here just yesterday asking about the sourdough schedule and you didn't say anything! [笑] And Tommy, you kept asking me weird questions about what flavors I like and I thought you were just, um, being your usual chatty self. [温暖地] This is chocolate with raspberry filling, isn't it? [非常真诚地] That's my absolute favorite. How did you even know that? [停顿] I mentioned it once like six months ago when we were talking about wedding cakes. [不知所措地] You remembered. All of you remembered. [哭着说] I can't believe thirty people just sang happy birthday to me in the middle of my shift. My manager's looking at me like I orchestrated this whole thing— [大笑] No, Sandra, I promise I'm as shocked as you are! [抽鼻子] You know, some days this job is, um... it's rough. The early mornings, the cranky customers, the burns from the ovens. [温暖地] But then you all do something like this and suddenly I remember why I love being here. [非常真诚地] You're not just customers, you're family. [愉快地] Okay, who wants the first slice?
