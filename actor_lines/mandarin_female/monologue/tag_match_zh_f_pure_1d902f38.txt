=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [苦涩地] 天哪，我花了那么多年撒谎，隐瞒自己的出身。编各种故事解释为什么我的手那么粗糙，为什么一摸番茄就知道熟没熟。[停顿] 我记得，嗯⋯⋯记得14岁的时候，学校有个女生问我为什么我妈英语说得那么差，我说她是出国留学的，没敢说她从9岁就开始摘草莓了。[懊悔地] 真是扯淡。

现在你看看我。[笑] 那些美食评论家啊，一个劲儿地夸我跟土地有"真正的联系"，说我有"祖传的农耕智慧"。[讽刺地] 是啊，祖传智慧，来自那些他们曾经看不起的土包子。

我是说，菜单上的所有东西—真的是所有东西—都是我们因为没钱才吃的。[越来越激动] 腌菜是因为必须保存起来。骨头汤是因为动物的每个部分都不能浪费。野菜是因为，那个，不要钱啊。

[温暖地] 我奶奶要是看到有人花40块钱吃她的穷人饭，肯定会笑死的。[停顿] 其实不对，她会⋯⋯我觉得她会很骄傲的。[激动地] 真的会很骄傲，因为我不—因为我终于不再感到羞耻了。[轻声地] 因为这一切都有了意义。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [苦涩地] God, I spent so many years lying about where I came from. Making up stories about why my hands were so rough, why I knew exactly when tomatoes were ripe just by touching them. [停顿] I remember being, um... being fourteen and this girl at school asked why my mom's English was so broken and I said she was studying abroad, not that she'd been picking strawberries since she was nine. [懊悔地] Such bullshit.

And now look at me. [笑] The food critics can't stop raving about my "authentic connection to the land" and my "generational farming wisdom." [讽刺地] Yeah, generational wisdom from people they would've called backwards. 

I mean, everything on that menu—everything—is what we ate because we couldn't afford anything else. [越来越激动] Pickled vegetables because we had to preserve them. Bone broths because we used every single part of the animal. Wild herbs because, well, they were free. 

[温暖地] My grandmother would've laughed so hard seeing people pay forty dollars for her poverty meals. [停顿] Actually no, she would've been... I think she would've been proud. [激动地] Really proud that I'm not—that I'm finally not ashamed anymore. [轻声地] That it all meant something.
