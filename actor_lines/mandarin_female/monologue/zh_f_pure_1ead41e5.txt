=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [anxious] 我就一直在想啊，要是我没发现那些数字不对劲会怎么样。[pause] Johnson老两口，他们都80多了，你知道吧？然后我就站在那儿，拿着记录板，看着他们的表，就是觉得... 不对劲。[confused] 那个读数根本说不通——就是说，比上个月高得离谱，但他们说一直在外地看女儿去了？[speeding up] 所以我又敲了他们的门，我就想，嗯，可能是我搞错了，可能是我看错了，结果Johnson先生一开门，我就闻到了。[gasp] 那个臭鸡蛋味。[very quickly] 然后我就"先生，你们得马上出来，你们俩都出来，有煤气泄漏。" [shaky voice] 他们根本不知道。[long pause] 他们就这样住了，不知道，可能好几天了吧？他们那个老炉子的引火灯熄了，就一直在... 漏气。[very quietly] 要是他们开灯开错了，或者炉子要是自动重新点火... [trailing off] [relieved] 还好他们没事，两个人都没事。[laugh] Johnson太太上礼拜还给我烤了饼干呢。[warm] 你说神不神？她说我救了他们的命，其实吧，我就是在干我的活儿，查查数字而已，但是... 哎。[very sincerely] 有时候那些无聊的事儿还真的很重要，你说是不是？


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [anxious] So I keep thinking about what could've happened if I hadn't noticed those numbers were off. [pause] The Johnsons, they're in their eighties, you know? And I'm just standing there with my clipboard, looking at their meter, and something's just... wrong. [confused] The readings don't make sense—like, way higher than last month but they said they'd been away visiting their daughter? [speeding up] So I knock on their door again, and I'm thinking, um, maybe there's a mistake, maybe I'm reading it wrong, but then Mr. Johnson opens the door and I can smell it. [gasp] That rotten egg smell. [very quickly] And I'm like "Sir, you need to get out of the house right now, both of you, there's gas." [shaky voice] They didn't even know. [long pause] They'd been living with it for, I don't know, maybe days? The pilot light on their old furnace had gone out and it was just... leaking. [very quietly] If they'd turned on a light switch wrong, or if the furnace had tried to reignite... [trailing off] [relieved] But they're okay, they're both okay. [laugh] Mrs. Johnson actually baked me cookies last week. [warm] Can you believe that? She said I saved their lives and honestly, I was just doing my job, checking numbers, but... yeah. [very sincerely] Sometimes the boring stuff actually matters, you know?
