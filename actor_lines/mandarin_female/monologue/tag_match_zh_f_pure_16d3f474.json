[sad] The foot traffic numbers after my holiday display were, um... they were pretty devastating. [regretful] Twenty percent drop. [sniffle] And I kept insisting we needed to be more avant-garde, more, I don't know, artistic? [mumbling] While Target down the street was just... selling things. [pause]\n\n[crying while speaking] Thirty-two people are losing their jobs. [gasp softly] Because I thought I was some kind of, what, retail Picasso? [very sad] Sarah from accessories, she's got three kids. [voice breaking] And Marcus, he just... he just bought a house. [cry] \n\n[exhausted] My contract ends Friday.
