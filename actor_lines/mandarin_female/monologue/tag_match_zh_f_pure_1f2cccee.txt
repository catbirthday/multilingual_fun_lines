Speaker [pure]: [颤抖的声音] 老马他...他把桌子都收拾了。23年啊，他在这儿待了23年，结果他们就这么—[停顿]像押犯人似的把他带走了。[苦涩地]就因为周二印刷机出的那档子事。[焦虑地]就是滚筒卡住了，把整批印刷品都给撕了的那次？[非常轻声]其实不是他的错。[懊悔地]他手把手教过我怎么调张力校准，跟我说了三遍，千万千万别把它调过那条红线。[结巴地]可我—我当时就是着急，想让大家看看我能多快把活儿干完。[愧疚停顿]结果出事了，全砸了，我就站在那儿。[咕哝着]让他背了黑锅。[沮丧地]他都没替自己辩解，就一个劲儿说肯定是他维护检查的时候疏忽了什么。[哭着说]他被叫进办公室的时候，那个眼神...[抽鼻子]我觉得他知道。[非常悲伤]但他什么都没说，一点儿都没把我供出来。[沮丧地]天啊，我应该说出来的，对吧？[犹豫地]我是说，我也需要这份工作，我还有房租、助学贷款要还，但这不是—这不是借口。[愤怒地]什么样的人会眼睁睁看着别人因为，呃，因为我30秒钟就搞砸的事儿丢掉整个职业生涯啊？[极度忧郁]老马培训了我三个星期，每天早上都给我买咖啡。[声音渐弱]而我却这样...

[咕哝着] Let him take the blame. [沮丧地] He didn't even defend himself, just kept saying he must have missed something in the maintenance check. [哭着说] The way he looked at me when they called him into the office... [抽鼻子] I think he knew. [非常悲伤] But he didn't say anything, didn't throw me under the bus or anything. [沮丧地] God, I should say something, right? [犹豫地] I mean, I need this job too, I've got rent, student loans, but that's not— that's not an excuse. [愤怒地] What kind of person just watches someone lose their whole career over, um, over something that took me thirty seconds to screw up? [极度忧郁] Marcus trained me for three weeks, bought me coffee every morning. [声音渐弱] And this is how I...
