Subject: Your father-in-law relationship evolved from awkward to genuine friendship over shared woodworking

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [warm] You know, I used to dread going over to her parents' house. Her dad would just sit there, and I'd sit there, and we'd both kind of nod at each other and that was it. [chuckle] Like two strangers waiting for the same bus. Then one day he mentioned he was building a bookshelf, and I don't know why but I just said "need help?" [pause] The look on his face was, um... surprised, I guess, but also kind of relieved? We spent four hours in that garage barely talking, just measuring and cutting and sanding. [smiling speaking] But it was the good kind of quiet, you know? Not awkward anymore. Now every Sunday we're out there working on something—last week it was a jewelry box for her mom. [excited] He taught me this Japanese joinery technique, no nails or screws, just wood fitting perfectly together. And we actually talk now, like really talk. About work, about when she was little, about his dad who was a carpenter. [very sincerely] Sometimes I catch myself looking forward to Sundays more than anything else in the week. Funny how that happens. [softly] We're finishing a dining table now, walnut with maple inlays, and I keep thinking... this is what having a dad feels like.
