=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [pure]: [very excited] 天啊，我简直不敢相信真的成功了！[pause] Marcus刚刚赢了他的第一个比赛——第一个比赛啊！[extremely happy] 还有那个球，就是说，它弧线转得刚刚好，正好到他需要的位置，虽然他那个...嗯...他手腕转动有限。[warm] 你知道吗，他刚来找我的时候，所有人都说不可能的。[frustrated] 他们都说"手臂活动受限怎么可能打出旋转啊？" [passionately] 但我就一直在想，肯定有办法的，对吧？[chuckle] 所以我就把指孔钻成这个特别的角度——其实吧，前前后后调了有17次微调。[confidently] 拇指孔的倾斜度必须完美，绝对完美，要不然球会掉的。[sniffle] 今天看他比赛的时候，天哪，第十轮他打出全中的那一刻...[pause] 我是说，全场都沸腾了。[very sincerely] 他妈妈在哭，他的理疗师在哭，妈的，我也——[laugh] 我肯定也哭了。[softly] 你知道吗，这么多年一直在给球钻孔，以为自己就是，怎么说呢，做器材的。[gasp softly] 但是这种事发生了你才意识到...[trailing off] 有时候你钻的是希望。[very quietly] 有时候，你是在把梦想钻进现实里。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [very excited] Oh my God, I can't believe it actually worked! [pause] Marcus just won his first tournament—his FIRST tournament! [extremely happy] And the ball, the way it hooked exactly where he needed it to, despite his, um... his limited wrist rotation. [warm] You know, when he first came to me, everyone said it couldn't be done. [frustrated] They were like "how's he gonna get the revs without full arm mobility?" [passionately] But I kept thinking, there's gotta be a way, right? [chuckle] So I drilled the finger holes at this really specific angle—actually, it was more like seventeen different micro-adjustments. [confidently] The thumb pitch had to be perfect, absolutely perfect, or he'd drop it. [sniffle] And when I watched him today, God, when he threw that strike in the tenth frame... [pause] I mean, the crowd just erupted. [very sincerely] His mom was crying, his physical therapist was crying, hell, I was— [laugh] I was definitely crying. [softly] You spend all these years drilling holes in balls, thinking you're just, I don't know, making equipment. [gasp softly] But then something like this happens and you realize... [trailing off] sometimes you're drilling hope. [very quietly] Sometimes you're drilling dreams into reality.
