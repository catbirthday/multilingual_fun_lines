=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [shaky voice] I just got off the phone with Mrs. Chen and I... 我真不敢相信她跟我说的。[pause] She said her settlement was only twelve hundred dollars. [confused] 1200块！脑外伤让她没法工作了啊。[angry] And I saw the paperwork—我们申请的是15万！

[frustrated] God, how many times did he tell me about fighting for the little guy? [bitter] 那些关于正直的大道理，说什么我们是受害者最后的防线。[laugh] 哈，真是个笑话。I mean, I trusted him with everything. [upset] 他教我怎么当律师的，天哪！

[very quietly] The Johnsons, the Nguyens, that teenager who lost his leg... [gasp softly] 我的天，有多少案子？[speeding up] How many people did he screw over while I was sitting there, 做笔记，还以为他是什么英雄？[furious] And the whole time he was just—what—用本该给坐轮椅的人的钱买他第三辆奔驰？

[very sad] I feel so stupid. [sigh] 那些一起加班的夜晚，我还以为我们...我不知道，我以为那代表着什么。[regretful] Twenty-three cases I referred to him this year. [crying while speaking] 23个家庭，我亲口向他们保证他会照顾好他们的。


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I just got off the phone with Mrs. Chen and I... I can't believe what she told me. [pause] She said her settlement was only twelve hundred dollars. [confused] Twelve hundred. For a traumatic brain injury that left her unable to work. [angry] And I saw the paperwork—we filed for a hundred and fifty thousand! 

[frustrated] God, how many times did he tell me about fighting for the little guy? [bitter] All those lectures about integrity, about how we're the last line of defense for people who've been hurt. [laugh] Ha. What a joke. I mean, I trusted him with everything. [upset] He taught me how to practice law, for Christ's sake!

[very quietly] The Johnsons, the Nguyens, that teenager who lost his leg... [gasp softly] Oh my God, how many cases? [speeding up] How many people did he screw over while I was sitting there, taking notes, thinking he was some kind of hero? [furious] And the whole time he was just—what—buying his third Mercedes with money that should've gone to people in wheelchairs?

[very sad] I feel so stupid. [sigh] All those late nights we worked together, I thought we were... I don't know, I thought it meant something. [regretful] Twenty-three cases I referred to him this year. [crying while speaking] Twenty-three families I personally promised he would take care of.
