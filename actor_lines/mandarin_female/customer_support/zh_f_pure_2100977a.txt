Customer Support [pure]: 好的好的，收到了。嗯，我看到您10月份的购买记录...行政系列的EX-7750-PRO型号。请问这个产品出什么问题了？

Customer [pure]: 它就是停了—不对其实也不是—昨天屏幕完全黑了。

Customer Support [pure]: 哎呀这可不行啊。让我看看...保修期到2025年10月，您肯定还在保修期内。我就是需要核实—呃，先走一下基本的故障排查流程。

Customer [pure]: 你认真的吗？我—听着，我是我们公司的运营副总。

Customer Support [pure]: 对对对，我理解。就是—系统要求我必须把这些步骤记录在保修申请WRN-4482-XL9里。很快的—您试过长按电源键15秒吗？

Customer [pure]: 显然我—呃其实不是，我还没试过那个具体的—好吧我试了。

Customer Support [pure]: 没事没事，完全理解。这种事总是在最糟糕的时候发生，对吧？我就确认一下—送货地址还是行政广场4500号800室吗？

Customer [pure]: 对那是—等等不对，我们搬了—现在是1200室。

Customer Support [pure]: 好的，更新了。您的更换产品追踪号是TRK-9938-XLMN-42。一小时内应该会收到邮件。今天还有其他需要帮助的吗？

Customer: I shouldn't have to—actually fine, it's james.wellington@executivecorp.com

Customer Support: Perfect perfect, got it. Hmm, I see the purchase here from October... executive series model EX-7750-PRO. What seems to be the issue with it?

Customer: It just stopped—no actually that's not even—the screen went completely black yesterday.

Customer Support: Oh that's not good. Let me see here... warranty shows active til October 2025, so you're you're definitely covered. I just need to verify—er, run through some quick troubleshooting steps first.

Customer: Are you serious? I'm—look, I'm the VP of Operations at my company.

Customer Support: Right right, I understand. It's just—the system requires me to log these steps for warranty claim WRN-4482-XL9. Real quick—have you tried holding the power button for fifteen seconds?

Customer: Obviously I—well actually no, I haven't tried that specific—yeah okay I tried that.

Customer Support: Mm-hmm, and nothing? Okay so... let me check if there's any known issues with this batch. Serial number should be on the bottom—starts with SN?

Customer: I can't—wait let me get my assistant to—never mind, it's SN-7739-QKM-2024

Customer Support: Got it got it. Hmm, interesting... there's actually a service bulletin FB-2024-0892 for this exact model. Looks like a manufacturing defect. I can—I can process an express replacement right now.

Customer: Finally. So when—no, how fast can you get it to me?

Customer Support: Let me check what's available... okay okay, so with priority handling code PRI-8827-XX, I can have a replacement unit to you by... Thursday? Wednesday if I upgrade to overnight.

Customer: Wednesday would be—I mean I guess that's acceptable if that's the best you can do.

Customer Support: Actually wait, let me try something else here... if I flag this under corporate account CA-5529-CORP... yeah, I can get Tuesday delivery, no extra charge.

Customer: Oh. That's—okay that's actually really helpful. Sorry I'm just—this week has been insane.

Customer Support: No no, totally understand. These things always happen at the worst time, right? I just need to confirm—shipping address is still 4500 Executive Plaza, Suite 800?
