=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [mix]: So basically. 我的工资单，又错了。

Customer Support [mix]: Let me see here... 我先要你的员工ID，然后我们可以从系统PAY-7745-B调出你的工资条，看看到底怎么回事。

Customer [mix]: It's like—sorry, hold on—4-4-8-2。不对等等，4-4-2-8。

Customer Support [mix]: Got it. 嗯，好的，这样调出了你的档案EMP442867，我能看到你最近三个工资周期的记录。我们要查哪个日期的？

Customer [mix]: This Friday's. 就是刚刚，你知道的，刚发的那个。

Customer Support [mix]: Right right. 让我调出那个具体的工资条...PST-11152024-A显示税前收入是$1,847，但你实际到手只有$1,243。跟我说说哪里不对？

Customer [mix]: They didn't pay my overtime. 又是这样，所以。

Customer Support [mix]: Okay so according to timesheet TS-8829-NOV，你那个周期记录了47.5小时。系统显示...嗯，只算了40小时。这确实不对。

Customer [mix]: Right. 就像我说的，第三次了。

Customer Support [mix]: Let me see here... 我需要查一下，你的经理应该在系统OTA-3384里批准加班的，但是没有授权码。他们有提过批准的事吗？

Customer [mix]: Chef said—no he told me—对不起，太吵了—他说他已经录入了。

Customer Support [mix]: Hmm, what if... 好的，我看到经理尝试过覆盖MAN-7745-C，但是周二晚上11:47被工资系统拒绝了。根本没通过。

Customer [mix]: So basically what now? 我需要那笔钱，房租要交了。

Customer Support [mix]: Right right. 那我们这么办，我创建一个优先调整单ADJ-9982-PRIORITY，标记为立即处理。应该24小时内就到你账户了。

Customer [mix]: Wait really? 他们真的能，搞定？这么快？

Customer Support [mix]: Absolutely. 这个调整会通过系统PAY-RAPID-7处理，可以绕过正常的3天等待期。你会收到短信确认，发到尾号4429的手机。

Customer [mix]: I mean. 好吧，那—嗯，那样就行。

Customer Support [mix]: Let me also... 嗯，我加个备注NTE-88429来防止这个再次发生。你们主厨需要培训一下加班提交门户OTS-2000的使用。我会安排的。

Customer [mix]: So like Tuesday I'll have it? 肯定能到账？

Customer Support [mix]: Monday actually. 调整单ADJ-9982-PRIORITY周末就会处理。你会看到$371.42入账，那是缺的加班费加上$15的系统错误补偿。


=== Original (English) ===

Customer: So basically. My check. It's wrong again.

Customer Support: Let me see here... I'll need your employee ID first, then we can pull up your pay stub from system PAY-7745-B and figure out exactly what happened.

Customer: It's like—sorry, hold on—4-4-8-2. No wait. 4-4-2-8.

Customer Support: Got it. Hmm, okay so that brings up your profile EMP442867 and I can see your last three pay periods here. Which date are we looking at?

Customer: This Friday's. The one that just. You know. Happened.

Customer Support: Right right. Let me pull that specific stub... PST-11152024-A shows gross earnings of $1,847 but your net came to $1,243. Walk me through what seems off?

Customer: They didn't pay my overtime. Again. So.

Customer Support: Okay so according to timesheet TS-8829-NOV you logged 47.5 hours for that period. System shows... hmm. Only credited for 40. That's definitely not right.

Customer: Right. Like I said. Third time.

Customer Support: Let me see here... I need to check something. Your manager should've approved overtime in system OTA-3384 but there's no authorization code. Did they mention anything about approval?

Customer: Chef said—no he told me—sorry, it's loud—he said he put it in.

Customer Support: Hmm, what if... okay I'm seeing manager override attempt MAN-7745-C but it got rejected by payroll system at 11:47 PM on Tuesday. Never went through.

Customer: So basically what now? I need that money. Rent's due.

Customer Support: Right right. So here's what we'll do. I'm creating priority adjustment ticket ADJ-9982-PRIORITY that flags for immediate processing. Should hit your account within 24 hours.

Customer: Wait really? They can actually. Fix it? That fast?

Customer Support: Absolutely. The adjustment processes through system PAY-RAPID-7 which bypasses the normal 3-day hold. You'll get text confirmation to number ending in 4429.

Customer: I mean. Okay. That's—yeah that would work.

Customer Support: Let me also... hmm. I'm adding note NTE-88429 to prevent this recurring. Your chef needs training on the overtime submission portal OTS-2000. I'll schedule that.

Customer: So like Tuesday I'll have it? For sure?

Customer Support: Monday actually. Adjustment ADJ-9982-PRIORITY processes over the weekend. You'll see $371.42 deposited, which is the missing overtime plus the system error credit of $15.
