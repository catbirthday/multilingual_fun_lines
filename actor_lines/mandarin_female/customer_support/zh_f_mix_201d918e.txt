=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [mix]: 早上好。我需要把我们公司的business account转给新的managing director，麻烦您帮我处理一下。

Customer Support [mix]: 早上好。我很乐意帮您处理这个account transfer。请问您的账号是多少，还有您在公司的职位是？

Customer [mix]: 账号是B7294。我是即将离任的operations director，Jennifer Hayes。

Customer Support [mix]: 谢谢您，Hayes女士。让我看看...好，我这边显示您的账户B7294-5831，您从2021年3月开始就是primary administrator，有signing authority。要处理这个ownership transfer，我需要您提供一些具体的文件。

Customer [mix]: 我就知道会需要这些。那具体需要我们准备什么呢？

Customer Support [mix]: 当然。

Customer [mix]: 请把完整的清单都告诉我，I can gather everything at once.

Customer Support [mix]: 您需要提交Form TOA-4521，就是Transfer of Authority的表格，我可以马上email给您。另外呢，we require a letter on company letterhead signed by both parties，还需要一份board resolution批准这个变更。

Customer [mix]: 听起来挺直接的。那一般来说，once everything is submitted，这个transfer要多久才能完成？

Customer Support [mix]: 我们收到所有完整的文件后，72个business hours内就能处理好。您会在两个email地址都收到确认，and the new administrator will get their access credentials，会通过secure message发到尾号是4429的电话上。

Customer [mix]: 太好了。能不能现在就把那个表格发到jhaynes at techcorp dot com？

Customer Support [mix]: 没问题。我现在就把Form TOA-4521发到那个邮箱，您应该在2-3分钟内就能收到，along with our documentation checklist DOC-8847-B。

Customer [mix]: 很好。那我们的service agreements和billing arrangements在transfer之后会保持不变吗？

Customer Support [mix]: 所有在contract SA-2944-7X下面的existing service agreements都不会变。新的account owner完成transfer后可以修改billing arrangements，但是您现在的payment schedule和每月$4,750的费用会自动继续。

Customer [mix]: 了解了。那现在在我authorization下面的sub-accounts会怎么样？

Customer Support [mix]: 所有17个sub-accounts都会自动转到新的primary administrator名下。不过呢，individual user permissions remain unchanged，除非新的administrator在admin portal那里specifically去修改，就是在admin.ourservice.com/transfer。

Customer [mix]: 有道理。那提交这些文件有deadline吗？

Customer Support [mix]: 没有严格的deadline，但是您现在的administrative access从今天12月3号开始还能用90天。2025年3月3号之后呢，you'd need to restart the transfer process，要用verification code VER-9982-TF。

Customer [mix]: 谢谢。我最迟周四下班前肯定能把everything都提交上去。

Customer Support [mix]: 太好了。您把文件提交到transfers@ourservice.com之后，you'll receive an automatic confirmation，reference number会以TRN-2024-12开头。如果需要任何协助，please don't hesitate to call back，打800-555-4900转7234就可以了。


=== Original (English) ===

Customer: Good morning. I need to transfer ownership of our business account to our new managing director, please.

Customer Support: Good morning. I'll be happy to assist with that account transfer. May I start with your account number and your current role with the organization?

Customer: The account number is B7294. I'm the outgoing operations director, Jennifer Hayes.

Customer Support: Thank you, Ms. Hayes. I have your account B7294-5831 here showing you as the primary administrator with signing authority since March 2021. To process the ownership transfer, I'll need some specific documentation.

Customer: I expected as much. What exactly will you need from us to complete this?

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: Please tell me the complete list so I can gather everything at once.

Customer Support: You'll need to submit Form TOA-4521 for Transfer of Authority, which I can email to you immediately. Additionally, we require a letter on company letterhead signed by both parties and a copy of the board resolution approving this change.

Customer: That sounds straightforward. How long does the transfer process typically take once submitted?

Customer Support: Once we receive all completed documentation, the transfer processes within 72 business hours. You'll receive confirmation at both email addresses, and the new administrator will get their access credentials via secure message to the number ending in 4429.

Customer: Perfect. Can you send that form to jhaynes at techcorp dot com right away?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm sending Form TOA-4521 to that email address now, and you should receive it within the next 2-3 minutes along with our documentation checklist DOC-8847-B.

Customer: Excellent. Will our service agreements and billing arrangements remain the same after the transfer?

Customer Support: All existing service agreements under contract SA-2944-7X will remain unchanged. The new account owner can modify billing arrangements after the transfer completes, but your current payment schedule and the monthly rate of $4,750 continue automatically.

Customer: Good to know. What happens to the sub-accounts currently under my authorization?

Customer Support: All 17 sub-accounts will automatically transfer to the new primary administrator. However, individual user permissions remain unchanged unless the new administrator specifically modifies them through the admin portal at admin.ourservice.com/transfer.

Customer: That makes sense. Is there a deadline for submitting these documents?

Customer Support: There's no strict deadline, but your current administrative access remains active for 90 days from today, December 3rd. After March 3rd, 2025, you'd need to restart the transfer process with verification code VER-9982-TF.

Customer: Thank you. I'll have everything submitted by end of business Thursday at the latest.

Customer Support: Perfect. Once you submit the documents to transfers@ourservice.com, you'll receive an automatic confirmation with reference number beginning with TRN-2024-12. Please don't hesitate to call back at 800-555-4900 extension 7234 if you need any assistance.
