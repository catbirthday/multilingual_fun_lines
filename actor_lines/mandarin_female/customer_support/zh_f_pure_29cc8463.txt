Customer [pure]: 就是说吧，我打电话来呢。是要让你们赔钱。因为你们搞出来的这个烂摊子。

Customer Support [pure]: 哦！呃，真的很抱歉听到您遇到问题了。我先—呃，其实我先调出您的账户吧。您能给我一下账号或者账户关联的电话号码吗？

Customer [pure]: 我看看啊... 555-0847。就是我还得租车。就因为你们。

Customer Support [pure]: 好的好的，我调出您的账户了，账户ID是A8847-NZ。呃，我看到10月23号有服务中断记录。您刚说—等等，您还租了车？

Customer [pure]: 对啊。300块。还有酒店。我真的是...我都没法说了。

Customer Support [pure]: 哇，这个—呃，这损失不小啊。我看看...嗯，好，我这边看到当天上午11:47的服务故障报告。呃，您有保留那些费用的收据吗？我想确保您能得到全额赔偿。

Customer [pure]: 我当然留着了。那现在怎么办？下次要是再这样的话...

Customer Support [pure]: 对对，绝对的。那我来—呃其实，我重新说一下。呃，您把收据发到claims@company.com，标注参考号CLM-9982-RT，我们会在48小时内处理赔付。

Customer Support [pure]: 对，我—嗯，我完全理解您的担心。我现在做的是，呃，给您的账户标记优先服务。您的优先码是PRI-6623-X。呃，基本上就是如果再出什么问题，您会立即得到升级处理。

Customer [pure]: 优先服务。行吧。那基本上下次我要是又被困在哪儿...？

Customer Support [pure]: 不会的—我是说，呃，优先状态意味着...其实，这是我的直线分机：4429。呃，打这个号码您就能完全跳过普通队列。优先客户的平均等待时间不到2分钟。

=== Original (English) ===

Customer: So basically I'm calling about. Getting money back. For the mess you caused.

Customer Support: Oh! Um, I'm so sorry to hear you've had an issue. Let me just—er, actually let me pull up your account first. Could you give me your account number or phone number associated with the account?

Customer: Let me see here... 555-0847. Like I had to rent a car. Because of you guys.

Customer Support: Okay perfect, I've got your account up here, account ID A8847-NZ. Uh, I can see there was a service disruption on October 23rd. So you mentioned—wait, you had to rent a vehicle?

Customer: Yeah so. Three hundred dollars. Plus hotel. I just... I can't even.

Customer Support: Oh wow, that's—um, that's significant. Let me look at... hmm, okay so I see the service failure report here from 11:47 AM that day. Er, do you have receipts for those expenses? I want to make sure we get you fully reimbursed.

Customer: Obviously I kept them. So what happens now? Next time this better not...

Customer Support: Right, absolutely. So here's what I'll—actually, let me start over. Uh, if you can email those receipts to claims@company.com with reference number CLM-9982-RT, we'll process the reimbursement within 48 hours.

Customer: Forty-eight hours. Hmm, okay so that means... Monday? Tuesday?

Customer Support: Well, er, today's Thursday so... actually no, wait—business days. So you'd see it by Monday afternoon, probably around 3 PM your time. Um, I'm also adding a $50 service credit to your account right now.

Customer: Fifty dollars. That's. Okay look, what if this happens again?

Customer Support: Yeah, I—hmm, I totally understand your concern. So what I'm doing is, uh, I'm flagging your account for priority service. Your new priority code is PRI-6623-X. Er, basically if anything goes wrong again, you'll get immediate escalation.

Customer: Priority service. Right. So basically next time I'm stuck somewhere...?

Customer Support: You won't be—I mean, um, the priority status means... actually, here's my direct extension: 4429. Uh, call that number and you'll bypass the regular queue completely. Average wait time is under 2 minutes for priority customers.

Customer: Let me write that... 4429. Basically I just. I'm exhausted. This whole thing.

Customer Support: I really—er, I get it. This shouldn't have happened. Um, is there anything else I can... oh wait, actually, I should mention the reimbursement includes tax, so you'll get the full $326.78 you spent on the rental.

Customer: Three twenty-six. Yeah. So like... the hotel too though?

Customer Support: Yes! Sorry, uh, I should've been clearer. Hotel, rental, any expense from the service failure. Hmm, I see here you uploaded a hotel receipt for $189.00 earlier? That'll be included in the Monday payment.

Customer: Okay so. Everything back Monday. I just... okay. That works.

Customer Support: Perfect. Er, just to confirm—total reimbursement of $515.78 hitting your account by Monday 3 PM. Reference number CLM-9982-RT for your records. Um, and again, I'm really sorry about this whole situation.
