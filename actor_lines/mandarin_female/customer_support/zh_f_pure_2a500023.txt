Customer [pure]: 就是说，我给我爸妈订了个结婚纪念日礼物，然后呢，收到的时候整个都摔碎了。

Customer Support [pure]: 哎呀，不会吧。我马上给您查一下账户。能告诉我订单号吗？应该是ORD开头，然后八位字符。

Customer [pure]: 呃，是ORD-4492-BK71。最惨的是，他们已经打开了。

Customer Support [pure]: 好的，看到了。这个是水晶相框，产品编号FRM-8827，14号发的货。真的很抱歉发生这种事。能跟我说说损坏成什么样了吗？

Customer [pure]: 玻璃全碎了。基本上整个东西在盒子里都成碎片了，那个。

Customer Support [pure]: 太糟糕了。我看到从物流记录上，经过了我们达拉斯的DC-447中转站。有时候包裹在那儿，怎么说呢，会被粗暴对待。我马上看看能为您做些什么。

Customer [pure]: 他们结婚40周年，然后呃，现在基本上觉得我给他们寄了个垃圾。

Customer Support [pure]: 哎哟，那多尴尬啊。好，我这边看到几个方案。要么给您加急重发一个，明天上午10:30前到。要么现在就全额退款，127.95美元。您看哪个合适？

Customer [pure]: 嗯，明天就是纪念日当天了，所以就是...我真不知道该怎么办了。

Customer Support [pure]: 行行行，这样吧。我给您升级成特快专送，明天早上9点前到，追踪号PRX-7729-XM。完全免费。说实话吧？这种事根本不该发生。我们最近的包装合格率只有82%。

Customer [pure]: 真的吗？那这次真的能完好无损地送到吗，还是说...？

Customer Support [pure]: 我给您标记特殊处理。代码SH-901。意思是双层包装，易碎标签，全套保护。跟您说句实话吧？普通快递可没这待遇。但这次必须万无一失。

Customer [pure]: 我已经...呃，我已经跟他们说了真正的礼物在路上，现在他们肯定觉得我在撒谎。

Customer Support [pure]: 嗯，要不这样？我们附上一封信？我可以加一封我们CEO的道歉信，说明运输损坏的事。参考号APL-4492。明确说明这完全是我们的责任？

Customer [pure]: 哦。嗯。对，这个真的太有用了。

Customer Support [pure]: 太好了。现在就加上。信会用正式信纸打印，批次7734-C。您知道吗？我再给您账户加25美元的代金券。这整件事太离谱了。

Customer [pure]: 谢谢。真的，我本来都要...我实在没法打电话跟他们解释。

Customer Support [pure]: 那当然了。谁都不该遇到这种事。您的特快专送还是免费的，确认邮件会发到4429结尾的邮箱。明天早上9点前送到。

Customer [pure]: 基本上您刚救了他们的纪念日。还有呃，可能也救了我们的关系。

Customer Support [pure]: 对对对。很高兴能帮您解决这个问题。您的案例编号是CS-88271-QX，有任何问题都可以联系。还有啊——我们全体祝您父母结婚纪念日快乐。


=== Original (English) ===

Customer: So basically I ordered this anniversary gift for my parents and, um, it arrived completely smashed up.

Customer Support: Oh no. Let me pull up your account right away. Can I get your order number? Should start with ORD dash and then eight characters.

Customer: Er, it's ORD-4492-BK71. Like, the worst part is they already opened it.

Customer Support: Got it, I see it here. Okay so this was the crystal photo frame, SKU number FRM-8827, shipped on the 14th. I'm really sorry this happened. Can you tell me what kind of damage we're looking at?

Customer: The glass is shattered. Basically the whole thing is in pieces, um, inside the box.

Customer Support: That's terrible. I can see from tracking it went through our Dallas hub DC-447. Sometimes packages get, you know, kind of roughed up there. Let me check what I can do for you right away.

Customer: It's their 40th anniversary and uh, they think I sent them garbage basically.

Customer Support: Oh geez. That must be so embarrassing. Alright so I'm seeing a few options here. I could overnight a replacement, arrival by 10:30 AM tomorrow. Or I could process a full refund of $127.95 right now. What would work better?

Customer: Um, tomorrow's the actual anniversary so like... I just... I don't know what to do.

Customer Support: Okay okay. Here's what we'll do. I'm upgrading you to priority express, delivery by 9 AM tomorrow, tracking PRX-7729-XM. Zero charge. And honestly? This shouldn't have happened. Our packaging score is only 82% lately.

Customer: Really? So it'll actually come intact this time or...?

Customer Support: I'm marking it for special handling. Code SH-901. That means double boxing, fragile stickers, the works. Between you and me? Regular shipments don't get this. But this needs to be perfect.

Customer: I just... er, I already told them their real gift was coming and now they probably think I'm lying.

Customer Support: Hmm. What if we included a note? I can add a message from our CEO apologizing for the shipping damage. Reference number APL-4492. Make it clear this was totally our fault?

Customer: Oh. Um. Yeah actually that would help so much.

Customer Support: Perfect. Adding that now. The note will print on official letterhead, batch 7734-C. You know what? I'm also adding a $25 credit to your account. This whole thing is ridiculous.

Customer: Thank you. Like seriously I was about to just... I couldn't handle calling them to explain.

Customer Support: Absolutely. Nobody should deal with this. Your new total with express shipping is still zero, confirmation email going to the address ending in 4429. Arrives tomorrow morning by 9.

Customer: Basically you just saved their anniversary. And um, probably our relationship.

Customer Support: Right right. I'm glad we could fix this. Your case number is CS-88271-QX if you need anything else. And hey—happy anniversary to your parents from all of us.
