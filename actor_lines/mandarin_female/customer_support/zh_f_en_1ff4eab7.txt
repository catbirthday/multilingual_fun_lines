=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So I'm—wait no—I'm a freelance writer, right? Can't update payment. Site's broken.

Customer Support [en]: Oh I see, let me let me pull up your account here... hmm, what's happening when you try to update? Is it giving you an error message or just not saving the changes?

Customer [en]: Error. Red box. Says—no wait, it's "invalid format" but that's wrong, it's a real card!

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, so that error code usually means, er, there might be a browser issue. Let me check your account first though—can you give me the email address you use to log in?

Customer [en]: sarah.chen at—sorry, no—sarahc.writes at gmail. Been a customer three years. THREE.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, I've got your account pulled up here, Sarah. You've been with us since March 2021, and hmm, I can see there was a payment attempt at 2:47 PM today that didn't go through. What browser are you using?

Customer [en]: Chrome. Always Chrome. Look, I've got deadlines—wait, five actually—five articles due tomorrow.

Customer Support [en]: Totally understand the urgency here. So what we're gonna do is, uh, I'm going to walk you through a quick fix that works about 90% of the time. First, can you clear your cache? That's Control-Shift-Delete on Windows.

Customer [en]: Did that already. Twice. Also tried Firefox—no wait, Safari. Nothing works. Nothing!

Customer Support [en]: Ah okay, you've already tried the basics, good good. Let me check something else... interesting, your account shows a security flag from IP address 192.168.1.47. Have you been traveling or using a VPN by any chance?

Customer [en]: VPN! Yes! Work requires—sorry, client requires it. Security thing. That's the problem?

Customer Support [en]: That's exactly it! So basically when our system sees a payment update from a VPN, um, it triggers this protection protocol. Here's what I'm I'm going to do—I'll temporarily whitelist your account for the next 30 minutes so you can update it.

Customer [en]: Oh thank God. Wait—do I turn off—should I disconnect the VPN first?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, definitely disconnect first, then, er, give it about 10 seconds and try again. I'm adding note CAS-4429-B to your file so if this happens again, the next agent will know exactly what's going on.

Customer [en]: This is—I mean—every month I pay! Every single month! Loyal customer here!

Customer Support [en]: No no, you're absolutely right to be frustrated. Actually, let me set up something better for you—I'm enabling our trusted user bypass, code TUB-8827-X, which means even with your VPN on, you won't hit this wall again.

Customer [en]: Really? That's—wait that's permanent? Forever? You can do that?

Customer Support [en]: Yep, permanent fix! Takes about 5 minutes to activate but once it does, you're all set. Your next billing date is November 15th at $49.99, so we definitely want this working smoothly before then.

Customer [en]: You just—honestly—saved my entire week. Seriously. Five deadlines! You saved them!

Customer Support [en]: Aw, I'm so glad I could help! Just remember if you have any other issues, reference ticket number TKT-20241030-8291 and mention the VPN bypass. We're here 24/7, and honestly, helping writers like you keep working is why I love this job.
