=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Good morning. I'm calling about an unexpected charge of $247.50 on my HSA card from yesterday afternoon.

Customer Support [en]: Good morning, and thank you for reaching out. I'd be happy to investigate that charge for you. May I have your HSA account number and the last four digits of your card?

Customer [en]: Certainly. The account number is 8847-2931 and the card ends in 4729.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I've located your account, member ID HSA-8847-2931-MW. I can see the charge of $247.50 posted at 3:47 PM yesterday from Wellness Partners Medical Group. Let me pull up the full transaction details.

Customer [en]: That's concerning. I didn't visit Wellness Partners yesterday. I was working my shift at Regional Medical Center.

Customer Support [en]: I understand your concern. The transaction shows merchant code MCC-8011, which indicates a medical provider, and the authorization came through terminal WP-0471-B at their billing department. Have you had any previous services with Wellness Partners?

Customer [en]: I had lab work done there three weeks ago, but I paid my copay at the time.

Customer Support [en]: Let me review your transaction history. I can see your previous payment of $45.00 on October 18th for lab services. This new charge of $247.50 appears to be coded as LAB-COMP-127, which typically indicates comprehensive metabolic panel testing.

Customer [en]: But that should have been covered by my primary insurance. I provided all my insurance information during that visit.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, that's a valid concern. According to our records, this charge was processed as a secondary billing after insurance adjustment code ADJ-2847-K. I'm going to initiate a dispute investigation under case number DSP-112924-7B.

Customer [en]: Thank you. What information will you need from me to move this forward?

Customer Support [en]: I'll need you to complete dispute form DF-2024-11A, which I can email to you immediately. Additionally, if you have your EOB from your primary insurance showing coverage for these services, that would strengthen your case significantly.

Customer [en]: I can get that EOB from my insurance portal today. How long will the investigation take?

Customer Support [en]: Once we receive your completed documentation, the standard investigation timeline is 7-10 business days under regulation REG-Z protocols. However, I'm flagging this as priority status PRY-4, which should expedite it to 3-5 business days.

Customer [en]: That's helpful. Will the disputed amount be frozen on my account during the investigation?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I've placed a temporary hold on the $247.50, reference number HLD-892471-X, which prevents it from affecting your available balance. You'll receive confirmation email EML-2784329 within the next fifteen minutes.

Customer [en]: Perfect. Should I contact Wellness Partners directly as well, or will you handle that communication?

Customer Support [en]: I recommend allowing us to handle the initial merchant contact through our dispute resolution team. We'll reach out to Wellness Partners using merchant ID MID-78294-WP today and request their billing documentation within 48 hours per our merchant agreement.

Customer [en]: I appreciate your thoroughness. Is there anything else I should document on my end?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, please keep reference number DSP-112924-7B for all future correspondence. I've scheduled a follow-up call for Tuesday, December 3rd at 2:00 PM to update you on the investigation status, confirmation code CALL-4927-TU.
