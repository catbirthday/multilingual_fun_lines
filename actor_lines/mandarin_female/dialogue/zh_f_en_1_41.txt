Character 1 [en]: Diplomacy is just weakness dressed up in fancy words.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, wow, that's... that's actually a pretty harsh take. I mean, I get where you're coming from, but diplomacy has prevented, like, countless wars throughout history, you know? It's not weakness—it's choosing dialogue over destruction.

Character 1 [en]: Name one time it actually worked when it mattered.

Character 2 [en]: Um, okay, the Cuban Missile Crisis? Kennedy and Khrushchev literally pulled us back from nuclear war through, well, basically secret negotiations and compromise. Without those backdoor diplomatic channels, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

Character 1 [en]: [animated] That's just delaying the inevitable! They still hate us!

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, but... but here's the thing—hatred doesn't have to be permanent, right? Look at Germany and France, they fought three major wars in seventy years, and now they're, uh, basically best friends economically and politically because they chose talking over fighting.

Character 1 [en]: You can't negotiate with terrorists or dictators.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, see, that's where it gets complicated though. Even Churchill negotiated with Stalin during World War Two, and he despised everything Stalin stood for. Sometimes you have to work with people you hate to prevent something worse from happening.

Character 1 [en]: So we should just roll over for Putin? For Xi?

Character 2 [en]: No no no, that's not— I'm not saying roll over at all. Standing firm on principles while keeping communication channels open isn't, like, surrender, it's strategic. You can be strong and still talk—actually, talking from a position of strength is often the most effective approach.

Character 1 [en]: [very loudly] Talking didn't stop Rwanda! Talking didn't stop Syria!

Character 2 [en]: You're... you're absolutely right, and those failures haunt me too, honestly. But the thing is, in both cases, the international community actually failed to engage in serious diplomacy early enough. By the time we started talking, it was already too late.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly my point. Action works. Words don't.

Character 2 [en]: [deep pitch] I hear your frustration, I really do. But, um, military action in Iraq and Afghanistan—did those actually solve anything? We spent trillions, lost thousands of lives, and the problems we went in to fix are arguably worse now.

Character 1 [en]: At least we tried to do something.

Character 2 [en]: [cry] But those were real people who died, not just statistics. Every one of those soldiers, every civilian caught in the crossfire—they had families, dreams, and... and maybe if we'd tried harder to talk first, to understand the complexities, some of them would still be here.

Character 1 [en]: You're being naive about how the world works.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe I am, a little. But, ugh, I'd rather be naive and keep pushing for dialogue than cynical and accept that violence is inevitable. The Northern Ireland peace process took decades of talking, but it worked—former enemies now share power peacefully.

Character 1 [en]: One example doesn't prove your point.

Character 2 [en]: Okay, fair, but... hmm, what about South Korea and Japan normalizing relations despite historical hatred? Or, um, the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel? These things take time and patience, yeah, but the alternative is endless cycles of revenge and bloodshed that solve nothing.
