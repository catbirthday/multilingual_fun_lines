Character 1 [pure]: 那B超显示一切都正常吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 哎对对对，完全正常！你家宝宝啊，正好是18周零3天，这个，呃，就是我们预期的嘛。心跳152次每分钟—特别棒，就在那个120到160的完美范围里。

Character 1 [pure]: 那体重呢？没问题吧？

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，你家小宝贝现在大概7盎司，就是，呃，基本上像在肚子里揣了个青椒那么重！这个孕龄正好—我们这个阶段希望看到6.7到8.1盎司之间。

Character 1 [pure]: 可是我已经胖了12磅了。

Character 2 [pure]: [groan] 哎呀，别为这个数字焦虑啦！你看啊，体重增长这事儿特别因人而异—整个孕期增加25到35磅都正常，你现在才，怎么说，还没到一半呢？有些周你会长2磅，有些周一点儿都不长。

Character 1 [pure]: [whispering] 我姐整个孕期才长了20磅。

Character 2 [pure]: 唉，每个人怀孕都不一样嘛，你知道吧？我干这行15年了，接生过3000多个宝宝，说实话，最健康的宝宝来自各种体重的妈妈—我是说，当然要在合理范围内啦。

Character 1 [pure]: 那些特别难受的症状什么时候开始？

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，一般28到30周的时候就，呃，有意思了。那时候宝宝差不多2.5到3磅，你的重心真的会改变—腰疼啊，睡不好啊，各种问题都来了。

Character 1 [pure]: 我的app说宝宝才5.5英寸长。

Character 2 [pure]: 对对。

Character 1 [pure]: 那是从头到屁股还是全身长度？

Character 2 [pure]: 啊，问得好！18周的时候我们量的是头臀长，就是那5.5英寸，但要是，嗯，把小腿伸直了量？差不多有8.7英寸，基本上就是，嗯，其实像根黄瓜那么长。

Character 1 [pure]: 这些测量到底有多准啊？

Character 2 [pure]: 这么说吧，B超测量可能会有10%到15%的误差，往哪边都有可能，特别是宝宝越大误差越明显。但我们每个参数至少测3次取平均值，所以通常，呃，体重估算误差在半盎司以内。

Character 1 [pure]: 你确定能看清所有的手指脚趾吗？

Character 2 [pure]: [exhausted] 哎当然啦，我数了两遍—10个手指，10个脚趾，4个心腔，2个肾，所有东西都在该在的地方。今天已经做了8个B超了，相信我，该看什么我清楚得很。

Character 1 [pure]: [shouting] 等等，你刚才说了是男孩女孩吗？

Character 2 [pure]: [empathetically] 我知道你们想保留惊喜，所以我特别小心不说漏嘴！但是告诉你哦，18周看性别的准确率有95%到99%，要是你们，嗯，哪天改主意想知道了随时可以。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: So the ultrasound shows everything's normal?

Character 2: Oh yeah, absolutely! Your baby's measuring right at 18 weeks and 3 days, which is, um, exactly where we'd expect. The heartbeat's a strong 152 beats per minute—perfectly in that sweet spot between 120 and 160.

Character 1: And the weight? Is that okay?

Character 2: Well, your little one's weighing in at about 7 ounces, which is, erhm, basically like carrying a bell pepper in there! That's right on track for gestational age—we like to see between 6.7 and 8.1 ounces at this stage.

Character 1: I've gained twelve pounds already though.

Character 2: [groan] Oh god, please don't stress about that number! Look, weight gain is so individual—anywhere from 25 to 35 pounds total is normal, and you're only, what, not even halfway through? Some weeks you'll gain 2 pounds, some weeks nothing.

Character 1: [whispering] My sister only gained twenty total.

Character 2: Yeah, well, every pregnancy is different, you know? I've delivered over 3,000 babies in my 15 years doing this, and honestly, the healthiest babies come from moms across the entire weight spectrum—I mean, within reason obviously.

Character 1: When do the really uncomfortable symptoms start?

Character 2: Mmm, typically around week 28 to 30 is when things get, uh, interesting. That's when the baby hits about 2.5 to 3 pounds and your center of gravity really shifts—back pain, trouble sleeping, the whole nine yards.

Character 1: My app says the baby's only 5.5 inches long.

Character 2: Right right.

Character 1: Is that crown to rump or full length?

Character 2: Ah, good question! So at 18 weeks we measure crown-to-rump, which is those 5.5 inches, but if we, um, stretched those little legs out? You're looking at closer to 8.7 inches total length, basically the size of a, hmm, cucumber actually.

Character 1: How accurate are these measurements anyway?

Character 2: Well look, ultrasound measurements can be off by about 10 to 15 percent either direction, especially as babies get bigger. But we take at least 3 measurements of each parameter and average them, so we're usually within, erhm, half an ounce on weight estimates.

Character 1: And you can definitely see all ten fingers and toes?

Character 2: [exhausted] Oh absolutely, I counted them twice—all 10 fingers, all 10 toes, 4 heart chambers, 2 kidneys, everything exactly where it should be. After doing 8 of these scans already today, trust me, I know what to look for.

Character 1: [shouting] Wait, did you say it's a girl or boy?

Character 2: [empathetically] I know you want to be surprised, so I'm being super careful not to slip up! But just so you know, at 18 weeks our gender predictions are about 95 to 99 percent accurate if you, um, ever change your mind about finding out.
