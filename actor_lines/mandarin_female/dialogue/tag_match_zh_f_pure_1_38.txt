Character 1 [pure]: 所以你是说你们app的病毒系数超过1.0？不可能吧。

Character 2 [pure]: 好吧其实呢，现在大概在1.2左右徘徊，我知道听起来很扯但是我们基本上就是，呃，按照Dropbox的模式，就是说每个注册用户在第一周内平均会邀请1.2个新用户这样子。

Character 1 [pure]: [过分客气] 哎呀那太好了！请问你们具体是怎么算这个指标的呢，如果你不介意的话？

Character 2 [pure]: 对对，我们其实是用Mixpanel来追踪的，公式还挺直接的—就是发出的邀请数乘以邀请的转化率，不过说实话这个，呃，归因分析挺乱的，因为用户经常从多个渠道注册进来。

Character 1 [pure]: [过于自信] K系数的计算我全都懂！我上一个创业公司达到过1.5呢！

Character 2 [pure]: 哇塞，1.5很厉害啊！那都是，PayPal级别的增长速度了。不过话说回来，嗯，真正的问题是你们有没有保持住，因为大部分公司在早期用户阶段结束后，那个，K系数都会急剧下降的。

Character 1 [pure]: 你们用什么推荐奖励来提升这些数字的？

Character 2 [pure]: 好的所以，我们做的跟Robinhood的候补名单游戏化很像—用户每成功推荐一个人就能获得，我是说，30天的高级功能，这个度把握得挺好的，就是说，既有分享价值又不会让人觉得太烦人。

Character 1 [pure]: 你有研究过Clubhouse巅峰期的表现吗？

Character 2 [pure]: 天哪，Clubhouse真的太疯狂了—他们的K系数据说一度达到过2.0这样，不过那个，呃，是被邀请制的稀缺性人为推高的，这种模式长期来看不太可持续，就像我们，呃，后来看到他们开放后的情况就很明显了。

Character 1 [pure]: 那你们的留存指标怎么样？

Character 2 [pure]: [非常温顺地] 呃...那个，留存率的话情况就有点...复杂？我们的月留存大概40%左右，也不算太差啦，但是，我是说，确实还没达到让病毒式增长真正有意义的那个程度吧。

Character 1 [pure]: 这有点惨。Pinterest早期的留存率都比这个好。

Character 2 [pure]: 好吧说的也是，不过Pinterest有那种，嗯，视觉发现的优势让用户自然而然地想回来。我们更像早期的LinkedIn，就是说网络效应需要，呃，更长时间才能显现，但理论上会变得更有粘性。

Character 1 [pure]: 说到LinkedIn，你们用户发出第一个推荐的时间是多久？

Character 2 [pure]: [低沉] 哦，这其实是我们最强的指标—平均第一次推荐时间大概是三天，比Reid Hoffman分享的LinkedIn第一年的数据要快，我记得，差不多快了整整一周，如果他分享的那些，呃，早期数据是准确的话。

Character 1 [pure]: 三天？比TikTok最初的数字还快。

Character 2 [pure]: 对吧？不过公平地说，TikTok的病毒传播机制不太一样—他们更多是靠，就是，外部分享到WhatsApp和Instagram，而不是应用内邀请，所以他们的K系数基本上没法准确追踪。

Character 1 [pure]: 你们有模拟过如果系数掉到1.0以下会怎样吗？

Character 2 [pure]: [非常温顺地] 呃，是的我们...我们跑过这些场景，基本上如果降到0.8以下的话，我们就得，那个，大幅增加付费获客预算，这样的话上个月给红杉讲的整个单位经济模型就全崩了。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: So you're telling me your app has a viral coefficient over 1.0? That's impossible.

Character 2: Well, okay, it's actually hovering around like 1.2 right now, which I know sounds crazy but we're basically following the Dropbox model where, um, every user who signs up invites an average of 1.2 new users within their first week.

Character 1: [过分客气] Oh that's wonderful! How exactly are you calculating that metric, if you don't mind me asking?

Character 2: Yeah so, we're tracking it through Mixpanel actually, and the formula is pretty straightforward— it's the number of invites sent times the conversion rate on those invites, though honestly the, erm, attribution gets messy when people sign up through multiple channels.

Character 1: [过于自信] I know all about K-factor calculations! We hit 1.5 at my last startup!

Character 2: Dang, 1.5 is impressive! That's like, PayPal-level growth territory. Though I guess, hmm, the real question is whether you maintained it, because most companies see their K-factor drop pretty dramatically after the initial, uhh, early adopter phase ends.

Character 1: What referral incentives are you using to boost those numbers?

Character 2: Alright so, we're doing something similar to what Robinhood did with their waitlist gamification— users get premium features for, I mean, thirty days per successful referral, which seems to be hitting that sweet spot between, you know, valuable enough to share but not so aggressive it feels spammy.

Character 1: Have you looked at what Clubhouse achieved during their peak?

Character 2: Oh man, Clubhouse was wild— their K-factor supposedly hit like 2.0 at one point, though that was, errm, artificially inflated by the whole invite-only exclusivity thing, which isn't really sustainable long-term as we, uh, clearly saw when they opened up.

Character 1: What about your retention metrics though?

Character 2: [非常温顺地] Well, ehh, retention is where things get a bit... complicated? We're seeing about 40% month-over-month retention which isn't terrible but, I mean, it's definitely not where we need it to be for true viral growth to actually matter.

Character 1: That's rough. Even Pinterest had better retention in their early days.

Character 2: Yeah okay, fair point, though Pinterest had that, hmm, visual discovery advantage that kept people coming back naturally. We're more like early LinkedIn where the network effects take, um, longer to kick in but theoretically become stickier over time.

Character 1: Speaking of LinkedIn, what's your time-to-referral looking like?

Character 2: [低沉] Ooh, that's actually our strongest metric— average time-to-first-referral is about three days, which beats what Reid Hoffman reported for LinkedIn's first year by, I think, almost a full week if those, erm, early metrics he shared were accurate.

Character 1: Three days? That's faster than TikTok's initial numbers.

Character 2: Right? Though to be fair, TikTok's viral mechanics work differently— they rely more on, like, external sharing to WhatsApp and Instagram rather than in-app invites, so their K-factor calculations get pretty much impossible to track accurately.

Character 1: Have you modeled out what happens if your coefficient drops below 1.0?

Character 2: [非常温顺地] Erm, yeah we've... we've run those scenarios and basically if we drop below 0.8, we'd need to, uhh, drastically increase our paid acquisition budget, which would pretty much blow up our entire unit economics model that we pitched to Andreessen Horowitz last month.
