Character 1 [pure]: 我刚发现我们整个部门六个月以来一直在用不同版本的绩效评估模板。

Character 2 [pure]: 等等，真的假的？这怎么可能啊？这简直就是教科书级别的部门壁垒案例啊。对比评估的时候难道没人发现不对劲吗，还是说大家都各干各的？

Character 1 [pure]: [excited] 没人发现！HR还以为我们都统一着呢！

Character 2 [pure]: 从系统论角度看还挺有意思的。你知道这让我想起什么吗？NASA那个火星探测器坠毁事件——一个团队用公制，另一个用英制。当基础沟通协议都失效了，你们公司还有多少看不见的问题在潜伏着？

Character 1 [pure]: 你觉得还有别的问题？

Character 2 [pure]: 肯定有啊。康威定律说得好，组织设计出来的系统会反映他们的沟通结构。如果你们团队连个简单模板都协调不好，我敢打赌你们的产品架构肯定也是支离破碎的。你们公司跨部门会议是怎么开的？

Character 1 [pure]: 我们每周一有个全员大会。

Character 2 [pure]: 全员大会就是做做样子，根本不是真正的沟通。关键问题是：同级之间的信息是怎么横向流动的？因为垂直沟通——就是你说的那种自上而下的周一例会——会造成习得性无助。大家都等着被告知，而不是主动互相交流。

Character 1 [pure]: 我们Slack还挺活跃的呀。

Character 2 [pure]: 懂了。

Character 1 [pure]: [cough] 不好意思，你刚想说Slack怎么了？

Character 2 [pure]: 数字化沟通制造了一种透明的假象。每个人都觉得自己在沟通因为一直在聊天，但研究显示Slack上只有7%的消息包含实际决策内容。剩下的都是表演性在线——看起来很忙而不是真的有产出。你们团队有什么非正式的小传统吗？

Character 1 [pure]: 我们有时候会一起去买咖啡。

Character 2 [pure]: 那些买咖啡的时间可能比你们开会还有价值。非正式网络才是真正的组织文化所在。Edgar Schein会说那些无结构的时刻才能揭示你们的真实价值观，而不是官网上写的那些。新人入职的时候——他们会立刻被邀请去买咖啡吗？

Character 1 [pure]: [laugh] 哈哈还真不会，通常要好几周他们才知道有买咖啡这回事。

Character 2 [pure]: 典型的圈内人动态。你们无意中制造了心理安全屏障。新员工要花好几周才感觉被"真正的"团队接纳，然后你们还纳闷为什么入职培训要那么久。你有没有试过画出这些非正式网络，看看谁是真正的核心人物，而不是组织架构图上看起来重要的人？

Character 1 [pure]: 听起来好复杂啊。

Character 2 [pure]: 其实比你想的简单——就追踪一下大家遇到问题找谁咨询，对比他们正式汇报给谁。正式权威和非正式权威之间的差距能解释大部分组织功能障碍。我打赌你们模板问题就是因为某个有影响力的人用了错误版本，然后其他人都跟着她，而不是跟着自己的直属上司。

Character 1 [pure]: [laugh loudly] 哎呀你说对了！就是我们的高级分析师——大家什么都照着她做！

Character 2 [pure]: [loudly] 这就是你们的影子组织架构图！她的文化资本比你们一半管理层都强，但没人正式承认这一点。如果你想改变什么，就得从这里开始——承认真实的权力动态，而不是纸面上的那些。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: I just discovered our entire department has been using different versions of the performance review template for six months.

Character 2: Wait, seriously? How does that even happen? That's like a textbook example of organizational silos breaking down. Did anyone notice the discrepancies when comparing reviews, or was everyone just working in their own bubble?

Character 1: [excited] Nobody noticed! HR just assumed we were all on the same page!

Character 2: That's fascinating from a systems theory perspective. You know what this reminds me of? The NASA Mars Climate Orbiter crash—one team using metric, another using imperial. When basic communication protocols fail, what other invisible problems are lurking in your organization?

Character 1: You think there's more going wrong?

Character 2: There's always more. Conway's Law says organizations design systems that mirror their communication structures. If your teams can't coordinate on a simple template, I'd bet money your product architecture is equally fragmented. What's your company's approach to cross-functional meetings?

Character 1: We have a weekly all-hands every Monday.

Character 2: All-hands meetings are theater, not communication. The real question is: how does information flow horizontally between peers? Because vertical communication—that top-down Monday meeting—creates learned helplessness. People wait to be told instead of talking to each other.

Character 1: Our Slack is pretty active though.

Character 2: Got it.

Character 1: [cough] Sorry, what were you going to say about Slack?

Character 2: Digital communication creates an illusion of transparency. Everyone thinks they're communicating because there's constant chatter, but studies show only about 7% of Slack messages contain actual decision-making content. The rest is performative availability—looking busy rather than being productive. Does your team have any informal rituals?

Character 1: We do coffee runs together sometimes.

Character 2: Those coffee runs might be more valuable than your meetings. Informal networks are where real organizational culture lives. Edgar Schein would argue those unstructured moments reveal your actual values, not the ones on your website. What happens when someone new joins—do they get invited to coffee immediately?

Character 1: [laugh] Actually no, it usually takes weeks before they figure out the coffee thing exists.

Character 2: Classic in-group dynamics. You're accidentally creating psychological safety barriers. New hires spend weeks feeling excluded from the "real" team while you wonder why onboarding takes so long. Have you ever mapped out these informal networks to see who's actually central versus who just looks important on the org chart?

Character 1: That sounds complicated.

Character 2: It's simpler than you think—just track who people go to for advice versus who they report to formally. The gaps between formal and informal authority explain most organizational dysfunction. I bet your template problem started because someone influential used the wrong version and others copied them, not their actual manager.

Character 1: [laugh loudly] You're right! It was our senior analyst—everyone copies everything she does!

Character 2: [loudly] There's your shadow org chart! She's got more cultural capital than half your management team, and nobody officially recognizes it. That's where you need to start if you want to fix anything—acknowledge the real power dynamics, not just the ones on paper.
