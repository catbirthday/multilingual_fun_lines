Character 1 [pure]: 我觉得我受够了。这些信啊，谜团啊，全都不想管了。

Character 2 [pure]: 这个...跟昨天比变化挺大的啊。你昨天还挺想搞清楚Eleanor是谁，还有你奶奶为什么要把那些信藏起来。

Character 1 [pure]: [curious] 可有什么意义呢？她走了，Margaret也不在了，知道内情的人估计都死光了。

Character 2 [pure]: 嗯，你可以这么看吧。但是这些故事啊，不管你承不承认，它们都在塑造着我们。你奶奶背负了这个秘密60年呢。

Character 1 [pure]: 也许她就是愿意背负着。也许有些事就该永远埋在心里。

Character 2 [pure]: 可能吧。不过按我的经验，那些被埋藏的东西总会在意想不到的时候冒出来。你妈说不定知道的比你想象的多。

Character 1 [pure]: [sneeze] 不好意思。阁楼上的灰尘要把我呛死了。我一分钟都不想再待在那上面了。

Character 2 [pure]: 身体上的不舒服可能也影响了你处理这些情绪上的发现。有时候环境确实会影响我们消化这些事。要不先休息一下，过段时间再说？

Character 1 [pure]: 没有过段时间了。我要把所有东西装箱捐出去。

Character 2 [pure]: 这也太草率了吧。诶，我理解这让你不舒服，但你昨天才刚发现这些。你不觉得要是不至少读一读，以后会后悔吗？

Character 1 [pure]: 我读够了。某个悲伤女人对死去孩子的幻想，不关我的事。

Character 2 [pure]: 用"幻想"来形容哀悼过程是不是太刻薄了。而且严格来说，如果这是你奶奶的姐妹，那这就是你们家族的历史啊。

Character 1 [pure]: 家族历史。是啊。好像知道了这个就能改变我的人生似的。

Character 2 [pure]: 没人说这会改变一切。但假装它不存在也不会让它消失啊。你发现它总有原因的，哪怕只是纯属巧合。

Character 1 [pure]: 纯属巧合。一切都只是巧合而已。

Character 2 [pure]: 你这世界观也太悲观了吧。昨天你还对这个谜团着迷，现在怎么搞得好像它得罪你了似的。

Character 1 [pure]: 昨天我还不知道我奶奶花了几十年时间给自己写信，写她死去的姐妹。

Character 2 [pure]: 所以真正的问题是这个。发现你奶奶有你从来不知道的另一面，有她从未分享过的痛苦。这确实会动摇任何人的根基。

Character 1 [pure]: [very melancholic] 我以为我了解她。我以为我们很亲近。

Character 2 [pure]: 你们是很亲近啊。但人都是复杂的，我们跟最爱的人分享的那部分自己，永远都不是全部。她是在保护你不受她的悲伤影响，不是在对你隐藏真实的自己。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: I think I'm done with this whole thing. The letters, the mystery, all of it.

Character 2: That's... quite a turnaround from yesterday. You seemed pretty invested in figuring out who Eleanor was and why your grandmother kept those letters hidden away.

Character 1: [curious] What's the point though? She's gone, Margaret's gone, everyone who might know is probably dead.

Character 2: I mean, that's one way to look at it. But these stories, they shape who we are whether we acknowledge them or not. Your grandmother carried this for sixty years.

Character 1: Maybe she carried it because she wanted to. Maybe some things should stay buried.

Character 2: Could be. Though in my experience, the things we bury have a nasty habit of sprouting up in unexpected ways. Your mom might already know more than you think.

Character 1: [sneeze] Sorry. The dust up there is killing me. I can't spend another minute in that attic.

Character 2: The physical discomfort probably isn't helping your mood about this whole situation. Sometimes our environment really does affect how we process emotional discoveries. Maybe take a break, come back to it later.

Character 1: There is no later. I'm boxing everything up and donating it.

Character 2: That seems hasty. Look, I get that this is uncomfortable territory, but you literally just found these yesterday. Don't you think you might regret not at least reading through them?

Character 1: I read enough. Some grieving woman's fantasies about a dead child aren't my responsibility.

Character 2: Fantasies is a pretty harsh word for grief processing. And technically, if this was your grandmother's sister, then this is your family's history we're talking about.

Character 1: Family history. Right. Because knowing this changes everything about my life.

Character 2: Nobody said it changes everything. But pretending it doesn't exist doesn't make it disappear either. You found it for a reason, even if that reason is just random chance.

Character 1: Random chance. That's all anything is.

Character 2: That's a pretty bleak worldview you've got there. Yesterday you were fascinated by this mystery, and now you're acting like it personally offended you somehow.

Character 1: Yesterday I didn't know my grandmother spent decades writing to herself about her dead sister.

Character 2: So that's what this is really about. Finding out your grandmother had depths you never knew about, pain she never shared. That would shake anyone's foundation.

Character 1: [very melancholic] I thought I knew her. I thought we were close.

Character 2: You were close. But people are complicated, and the parts of ourselves we share, even with those we love most, they're never the complete picture. She was protecting you from her grief, not hiding herself from you.
