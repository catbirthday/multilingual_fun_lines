Character 1 [mix]: 所以你们那个宝贝prospect rankings出来了。让我猜猜，你那个人还是连top 50都进不去吧？

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] 哎呀，拜託——你看，rankings这种东西本来就超主观的，你知道吗？不同的球探看重不同的东西，而且说实话，这些评估的人一半都没看过Marcus打现场比赛，他们就是，呃，看看highlight reels而已。

Character 1 [mix]: Marcus？那个打不到curveball的瘦小子？

Character 2 [mix]: 好好好，他现在是对breaking stuff有点困难，但这孩子才19岁啊！他的exit velocity，我是说，consistently over 108 mph，这基本上已经是elite level了。

Character 1 [mix]: [child-like] 但是他能打到小小的baby curveball吗？

Character 2 [mix]: [passionately] 你完全没抓到重点！他的swing mechanics在那里，bat speed简直疯狂——他只需要，嗯，maybe 200 more at-bats against quality breaking balls，他就会适应的，我保证！

Character 1 [mix]: 我打赌他排名还在你说很烂的那个委内瑞拉游击手后面。

Character 2 [mix]: [sneeze] 阿嚏！不好意思，呃——对啊，Ramirez排第18，honestly this is ridiculous，因为他的防守，嗯，充其量就是普通水平，而且他都22了，所以projection空间小很多。

Character 1 [mix]: 你们的球探一定是喝醉了在工作。

Character 2 [mix]: 嗯，这话从你们嘴里说出来真是讽刺，your organization drafted three pitchers with torn UCLs last year。就是，没人想过要，我不知道，先看看医疗报告吗？

Character 1 [mix]: 至少我们的人过了rookie ball。

Character 2 [mix]: 哇哇，那根本不是——Marcus在High-A打击率.312，which is actually really impressive for someone his age。大部分prospects 21、22岁都还碰不到High-A，你知道吗？

Character 1 [mix]: [cheerful] 知道什么更厉害吗？我们第12名的prospect昨天打了三支全垒打！

Character 2 [mix]: 是啊，well，在Arizona Fall League打全垒打跟面对大联盟投手不太一样吧。那边的球场基本上，就是，little league dimensions配上干燥的空气。

Character 1 [mix]: 说到little league，Marcus的fielding percentage怎么样？

Character 2 [mix]: 反正他要转去一垒了，so that's kind of irrelevant？我是说，他的臂力在三垒永远不够，但他的打击在一垒绝对够carry——这就是整个development plan。

Character 1 [mix]: 一垒？那是prospects去死的地方！

Character 2 [mix]: [gasp loudly] 天啊，你真的——这种想法太过时了！你看Freddie Freeman，Paul Goldschmidt，Matt Olson——一垒现在，呃，producing some of the best hitters in baseball right now！

Character 1 [mix]: 还是进不了前一百名吧。

Character 2 [mix]: 其实，Baseball America在midseason update刚把他提到94名，which，我是说，考虑到他因为腿筋的问题缺席了六周，that's pretty remarkable progression，对一个，嗯，一月份还没排名的孩子来说。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: So your precious prospect rankings came out. Let me guess, your guy's still not even top fifty?

Character 2: [bitter] Oh come on, that's— look, rankings are so subjective anyway, you know? Different scouts weight different things, and honestly, half these evaluators haven't even seen Marcus play live, they're just, uhh, going off highlight reels.

Character 1: Marcus? That skinny kid who can't hit a curveball?

Character 2: Okay okay, so he's struggling with breaking stuff right now, but the kid's only nineteen! His exit velocity is like, I mean, it's consistently over 108 mph, which is basically elite level already.

Character 1: [child-like] But can he hit a wittle baby curveball?

Character 2: [passionately] You're missing the entire point here! The swing mechanics are there, the bat speed is insane— he just needs, um, maybe 200 more at-bats against quality breaking balls and he'll adjust, I guarantee it!

Character 1: Bet he's ranked behind that shortstop from Venezuela you said sucked.

Character 2: [sneeze] Achoo! Sorry, ugh— yeah, Ramirez is ranked 18th which is honestly ridiculous because his defense is, ehh, mediocre at best and he's already 22, so there's way less projection there.

Character 1: Your scouts must be drinking on the job.

Character 2: Mmm, that's rich coming from someone whose organization drafted three pitchers with torn UCLs last year. Like, did nobody think to, I don't know, check their medical reports first?

Character 1: At least our guys made it past rookie ball.

Character 2: Woah woah, that's not even— Marcus hit .312 in High-A, which is actually really impressive for someone his age. Most prospects don't even sniff High-A until they're 21 or 22, you know?

Character 1: [cheerful] Know what else is impressive? Our number twelve prospect just went yard three times yesterday!

Character 2: Yeah well, hitting bombs in the Arizona Fall League isn't exactly, um, the same as facing major league pitching. The parks out there are basically, like, little league dimensions with that dry air.

Character 1: Speaking of little league, how's Marcus's fielding percentage?

Character 2: He's converting to first base anyway, so that's kind of irrelevant? I mean, his arm was never going to play at third, but his bat will absolutely carry at first— that's the whole development plan here.

Character 1: First base? That's where prospects go to die!

Character 2: [gasp loudly] Oh my god, are you seriously— that's such an outdated way of thinking! Look at Freddie Freeman, Paul Goldschmidt, Matt Olson— first base is, uhh, producing some of the best hitters in baseball right now!

Character 1: Still won't crack the top hundred though.

Character 2: Actually, Baseball America just bumped him to 94th in their midseason update, which, I mean, considering he missed six weeks with that hamstring thing, that's pretty remarkable progression for a kid who was unranked in, hmm, January.
