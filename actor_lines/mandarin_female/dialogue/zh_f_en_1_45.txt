Character 1 [en]: Have you looked into the Goldman Sachs learning stipend program for next quarter?

Character 2 [en]: [stuttering] I—I haven't actually, no. Been focused on the Microsoft Azure certification path they're offering through Coursera. Is Goldman's program open to all departments now or just the trading division?

Character 1 [en]: It's company-wide now, but you need manager approval from someone VP level or higher.

Character 2 [en]: [condescending] Well obviously you'd need executive sign-off for something that generous. Goldman doesn't just hand out five thousand dollars without proper oversight. Have you even checked if your manager, what's his name, Peterson, would support your application?

Character 1 [en]: It's Patterson, and yes, he's already pre-approved my request for the Columbia Business School executive education track.

Character 2 [en]: [loudly] Columbia? That's ambitious! The weekend MBA prep courses there run almost the full stipend amount. You're not leaving anything for LinkedIn Learning or those Google Cloud certifications everyone's been pushing.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] I've already completed three Google certifications on my own time without any reimbursement!

Character 2 [en]: [bored] Right, the Analytics one, the Project Management one, and probably the UX Design certificate. Standard stuff. JPMorgan's program gives you seven thousand plus they cover Wharton Online courses separately, just so you know.

Character 1 [en]: JPMorgan also requires a two-year commitment post-training. Did you factor that in?

Character 2 [en]: The lock-in period is actually eighteen months now, they changed it in January. But yeah, that's still significant if you're thinking about jumping to Deloitte or McKinsey afterward.

Character 1 [en]: I'm not jumping anywhere. I'm investing in skills that benefit both me and Goldman long-term.

Character 2 [en]: Fair enough. The Harvard Business Review subscription and MasterClass business track are included free with our package anyway. No need to waste stipend dollars on those platforms like people at Morgan Stanley have to.

Character 1 [en]: [gasp loudly] Wait, MasterClass is included? Since when?

Character 2 [en]: Since the November benefits update. HR sent three emails about it, plus there was that Teams announcement from Sarah Chen in Learning & Development.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] I must have missed those during the Deutsche Bank merger prep. Too many emails that week.

Character 2 [en]: The merger prep was in October though. But whatever, you should also know that Stanford's online programs now qualify for full reimbursement, not just the fifty percent they used to offer.

Character 1 [en]: Stanford GSB or Stanford Engineering?

Character 2 [en]: Both actually. Even their new Center for Professional Development courses through SCPD are covered. Much better deal than what CitiGroup offers their employees, which caps out at three thousand.

Character 1 [en]: This is incredibly helpful. I'm scheduling time with Patterson today to revise my learning plan.

Character 2 [en]: Smart move. The Q1 deadline for Goldman's education reimbursement is December 15th, and trust me, the funds always run out early. Last year Boeing and Amazon employees grabbed most of the executive slots at Kellogg and Yale SOM.
