Character 1 [en]: [loudly] You do refugee law? That must be incredibly depressing.

Character 2 [en]: Oh no, not at all! I mean, yeah, there are heartbreaking moments for sure, but honestly? Getting someone their asylum approval is like—it's pure joy. You're literally saving lives, reuniting families, giving people their futures back.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] How'd you even get into that field?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] So I was actually studying international relations, right? And then I volunteered at this detention center translation service and, wow, it just clicked. These people's stories were incredible—fleeing persecution, surviving things that would break most of us, and still having so much hope.

Character 1 [en]: What's the process actually like?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, it's, uh, it's intense! First you file the I-589 within one year of arrival—that's crucial—then there's biometrics, the interview prep which takes months because we need every detail perfect, supporting evidence, country condition documentation, psychological evaluations sometimes.

Character 1 [en]: One year? That seems really short.

Character 2 [en]: Right? It's actually one of the biggest issues we face! Some people don't even know they can apply, or they're too traumatized to talk about what happened, or they're waiting for family members. We argue extraordinary circumstances constantly but judges are, mmm, they're getting stricter.

Character 1 [en]: What counts as persecution exactly?

Character 2 [en]: So it has to be on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or particular social group—that last one is where we get creative! LGBTQ cases, domestic violence survivors, families targeted by gangs. The key is showing government unwillingness or inability to protect.

Character 1 [en]: Particular social group sounds vague.

Character 2 [en]: Oh it's wonderfully vague! We've argued everything from "unmarried women refusing genital cutting" to "former gang members" as social groups. The case law is, um, constantly evolving. Matter of A-B- basically destroyed domestic violence claims but we're finding workarounds through political opinion arguments.

Character 1 [en]: How do you prove someone's story is true?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, that's the million-dollar question! Documentary evidence is gold but most people flee with nothing, right? So we use expert witnesses, psychological evaluations showing PTSD patterns consistent with torture, country condition reports, sometimes even, like, forensic analysis of scars or injuries.

Character 1 [en]: [cough] Sorry. What's your success rate?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? With good representation it jumps from like 11% to over 50%! But it depends—some judges grant 90% of cases, others grant 2%. We literally have an app that tracks judge stats because your life can depend on which courtroom you're assigned to.

Character 1 [en]: Two percent? That can't be legal.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, it's totally legal and completely insane! Immigration judges have, um, basically no oversight, massive discretion, and some are former ICE prosecutors who, well, let's just say they're not particularly sympathetic. We call certain courtrooms "deportation factories" for a reason.

Character 1 [en]: Do you ever lose cases you should've won?

Character 2 [en]: [jealous] All the time, and watching other attorneys with worse cases get approvals because they drew the "nice" judge while my client with torture scars gets denied? Ugh. It's maddening. But then next week you win an impossible case and remember why this work matters so much.
