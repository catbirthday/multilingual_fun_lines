Character 1 [pure]: 哎，我刚入手了个Quest 3头显，简直震撼到我了。你玩过VR吗？

Character 2 [pure]: [laugh loudly] 哇塞，你这是要开启新世界的大门了！我玩VR已经有三年了，从Quest 2开始就一发不可收拾了。你都试了什么游戏？

Character 1 [pure]: 就Beat Saber还有一些免费demo。我胳膊快废了。

Character 2 [pure]: Beat Saber真的是入坑神作。等你胳膊恢复了，一定要试试Walkabout迷你高尔夫——听起来很无聊我知道，但是会上瘾的，特别是能拉朋友一起在线玩的话。

Character 1 [pure]: 迷你高尔夫？真的假的？这就是你的推荐？

Character 2 [pure]: 我知道我知道，听着很扯，但是相信我。物理引擎特别棒，关卡设计也很有创意，累了一天之后玩这个特别治愈。而且不会像Beat Saber那样把你胳膊搞废。

Character 1 [pure]: [groan] 说到胳膊废了，我试了那个Thrill of the Fight拳击游戏。大错特错。

Character 2 [pure]: 那游戏就该贴个健身警告！我第一周也犯了同样的错——本来觉得自己体力还行，结果跟最简单的对手打了三回合，接下来两天胳膊都抬不起来。

Character 1 [pure]: [anxious] 玩有些游戏会觉得有点恶心是正常的吗？就是那种在游戏里走路但实际上没动的时候？

Character 2 [pure]: 完全正常，那是晕动症，因为你眼睛看到的和内耳感觉到的不一致。先用瞬移移动代替平滑移动，还有对着脸吹个风扇——听起来很怪但真的能帮助定位。

Character 1 [pure]: [laugh] 风扇？你逗我呢吧？

Character 2 [pure]: 真的不骗你！气流能给大脑另一个静止的参考点。还有，姜糖对有些人也管用，千万别硬撑——一感觉不舒服就立刻休息，不然会产生心理阴影的。

Character 1 [pure]: 网上那些全身追踪套装是怎么回事？

Character 2 [pure]: 那些在VRChat这类社交VR里特别赞，但说实话，除非你特别喜欢跳舞或者社交空间，不然有点大材小用。Quest 3的手势追踪已经很厉害了——你试过不用手柄吗？

Character 1 [pure]: 等等，可以不用手柄？

Character 2 [pure]: 现在手势追踪已经很不错了！先在主界面试试——捏合选择，自然抓取，甚至能在虚拟键盘上打字。有些游戏也支持，虽然玩快节奏的游戏还是没手柄精准。

Character 1 [pure]: 信息量太大了。我还有好多不知道的。

Character 2 [pure]: [crying while speaking] 不好意思，我有点激动了，因为我想起当初自己也是这种感觉，现在VR已经是我生活特别重要的一部分了。你会发现超多不可思议的体验——从冥想应用到攀登珠穆朗玛峰，再到和朋友在虚拟世界里聚会。

Character 1 [pure]: 你为了VR哭了？这个...其实还挺感人的。

Character 2 [pure]: [deep pitch] 你听我说，当你在The Climb 2里站在虚拟悬崖边上，你的大脑真的会觉得你可能掉下去的时候，你就懂了。VR一旦开窍了就不一样了——这不只是游戏，这是体验数字世界的全新方式。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Hey, so I just got one of those Quest 3 headsets and I'm completely blown away. Have you tried VR yet?

Character 2: [laugh loudly] Oh man, you're in for such a wild ride! I've been deep into VR for about three years now, started with the Quest 2 and never looked back. What games have you tried so far?

Character 1: Just Beat Saber and some free demos. My arms are killing me.

Character 2: Beat Saber is the perfect gateway drug honestly. Once your arms recover, you should definitely check out Walkabout Mini Golf—it sounds boring but it's weirdly addictive, especially if you can convince friends to play with you online.

Character 1: Mini golf? Really? That's your recommendation?

Character 2: I know, I know, it sounds ridiculous, but trust me on this one. The physics are perfect, the courses are creative, and there's something incredibly zen about it after a long day. Plus it won't destroy your arms like Beat Saber does.

Character 1: [groan] Speaking of destroyed arms, I tried that Thrill of the Fight boxing game. Huge mistake.

Character 2: That game should come with a mandatory fitness warning! I made the same mistake my first week—thought I was in decent shape until I fought three rounds against the easiest opponent and couldn't lift my arms for two days.

Character 1: [anxious] Is it normal to feel kind of nauseous in some games? Like when I'm walking around but not actually moving?

Character 2: Totally normal, that's motion sickness from the disconnect between what your eyes see and what your inner ear feels. Start with teleport movement instead of smooth locomotion, and try pointing a fan at your face—sounds weird but it really helps with orientation.

Character 1: [laugh] A fan? You're joking.

Character 2: Dead serious! The airflow gives your brain another reference point for stillness. Also, ginger candy helps some people, and never push through the nausea—take breaks the second you feel queasy or you'll develop an aversion.

Character 1: What about those full body tracking setups I keep seeing online?

Character 2: Those are amazing for social VR apps like VRChat, but honestly unless you're really into dancing or social spaces, they're overkill. The Quest 3's hand tracking is already pretty impressive for most things—have you tried it without controllers yet?

Character 1: Wait, you can use it without controllers?

Character 2: The hand tracking is surprisingly good now! Try it in the home environment first—you can pinch to select, grab things naturally, and even type on the virtual keyboard. Some games support it too, though it's not quite as precise as controllers for fast-paced stuff.

Character 1: This is all so overwhelming. There's so much I don't know.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] Sorry, I'm getting emotional because I remember feeling exactly the same way when I started, and now VR is such a huge part of my life. You're going to discover so many incredible experiences—from meditation apps to climbing Mount Everest to hanging out with friends in virtual worlds.

Character 1: You're crying about VR? That's... actually kind of sweet.

Character 2: [deep pitch] Look, when you stand on the edge of a virtual cliff in The Climb 2 and your brain genuinely believes you might fall, you'll understand. VR hits different when it clicks—it's not just gaming, it's a whole new way of experiencing digital worlds.
