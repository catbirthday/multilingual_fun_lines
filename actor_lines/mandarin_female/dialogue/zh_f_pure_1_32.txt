Character 1 [pure]: [stern] 你已经喝了不少了吧？

Character 2 [pure]: 哎呀，别这样嘛，我就是...嗯，我在庆祝呢！这不是乔迁派对吗？再说了，你知道我最近在法院那边的事儿，就那个住房歧视案，真的是，唉，有时候就得放松放松。

Character 1 [pure]: 我都不知道你在办那个案子。进展怎么样？

Character 2 [pure]: 说实话，糟透了！法官一直，呃，一直延期，因为被告的律师在耍花招，与此同时我的当事人真的是睡在车里，因为找不到任何愿意租给她的地方，这就是我们起诉的原因啊！

Character 1 [pure]: 听起来真的很让人抓狂。

Character 2 [pure]: 抓狂都不足以...不足以形容，你懂吗？就是说，我们在这么漂亮的派对上，每个人都有房子住，我就一直想着那些，嗯，那些同样配得上这一切的人，但就是得不到，因为这个体制根本就是坏透了。

Character 1 [pure]: 你真的是一刻都停不下来，是吧？

Character 2 [pure]: 对啊！凭什么要停下来？总得有人...有人继续战斗吧，就算我在派对上有点醉了，因为不公正的事情又不会周末休息，对不对？

Character 1 [pure]: 你说的倒也有道理。

Character 2 [pure]: 看吧，你懂我！这就是为什么我，嗯，为什么我一直都挺喜欢你的，你真的会听，而不是光叫我放轻松什么的，不过说实话现在房间有点在转，我可能得少喝点酒了。

Character 1 [pure]: 要不去那边吃点小食？

Character 2 [pure]: 哦，那些小...那叫什么，脆面包片？对，可能是该吃点，但我先跟你说，这个房东居然当着我当事人的面说他不租给"她这种人"，这简直是明目张胆地违法，我听到的时候差点笑出来。

Character 1 [pure]: 他真的当面说了？

Character 2 [pure]: 就当着她的面！然后，呃，然后他还想改口说他指的是单亲妈妈，好像这样就没问题了似的，这根本就没有任何区别，还是歧视，我一定要让他付出代价。

Character 1 [pure]: 听起来你们的案子很有把握。

Character 2 [pure]: 确实很有把握，但问题是...不好意思，我在这么好的派对上发脾气，就是说每拖延一天就意味着她又一晚不安全，她的孩子们又要问为什么不能有张真正的床，这些真的压得我喘不过气，你懂吗？

Character 1 [pure]: [condescending] 哎呀，我相信最终一切都会好起来的。

Character 2 [pure]: 最终？嗯，你当然可以这么说了，你又不是那个，呃，每天都在打这些仗的人，看着人们受苦而这个体制慢得像蜗牛一样，其他人就只会耸耸肩说"最终会好的"。

Character 1 [pure]: [mocking] 我们的大英雄，一个案子一个案子地拯救世界。

Character 2 [pure]: 你想怎么嘲笑我都行，但至少我在努力做点改变，而不是，嗯，光站在派对上说些俏皮话，是的，也许我是醉了，但至少我在乎一些比自己更重要的东西。


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [stern] You've had quite a bit to drink already, haven't you?

Character 2: Oh come on, I'm just... mmm, I'm celebrating! This is a housewarming, right? And besides, you know what I've been dealing with at the courthouse lately, trying to get that housing discrimination case through, it's just, ugh, sometimes you need to unwind.

Character 1: I didn't realize you were on that case. How's it going?

Character 2: It's going terribly, honestly! The judge keeps, er, postponing because the defendant's lawyer is playing these games, and meanwhile my client is literally sleeping in her car because she can't find anywhere that'll rent to her, which is exactly why we're suing in the first place!

Character 1: That sounds incredibly frustrating.

Character 2: Frustrating doesn't even... doesn't even begin to cover it, you know? Like, here we are at this beautiful party, everyone's got homes, and I keep thinking about all the people who, um, who deserve this too but can't get it because the system is so fundamentally broken.

Character 1: You really can't turn it off, can you?

Character 2: No! And why should I? Someone's gotta... gotta keep fighting, even if I'm a little tipsy at a party, because injustice doesn't take weekends off, does it?

Character 1: I suppose you have a point there.

Character 2: See, you get it! That's why I, hmmm, that's why I always liked you, you actually listen instead of just telling me to relax or whatever, though honestly right now the room is spinning a tiny bit so maybe I should slow down on the wine.

Character 1: Maybe grab some of those appetizers over there?

Character 2: Oh those little... what are they, crostinis? Yeah, probably smart, but first let me tell you about this landlord who literally told my client to her face that he doesn't rent to "her type" which is so blatantly illegal I almost laughed when I heard it.

Character 1: He actually said that out loud?

Character 2: Right to her face! And then, uh, then he tried to backtrack and say he meant single mothers, as if that makes it better, which it absolutely doesn't, it's still discrimination and I'm gonna nail him for it.

Character 1: Sounds like you have a solid case then.

Character 2: We do, we really do, but the thing is... sorry, I'm getting all worked up at this nice party, it's just that every delay means another night she's not safe, another night her kids are asking why they can't have a real bed, and that weighs on me, you know?

Character 1: [condescending] Well, I'm sure everything will work out eventually.

Character 2: Eventually? Mmm, that's easy for you to say when you're not the one, er, fighting these battles every day, watching people suffer while the system moves at a snail's pace and everyone else just shrugs and says "eventually."

Character 1: [mocking] My hero, saving the world one case at a time.

Character 2: You can mock me all you want, but at least I'm trying to make a difference instead of just, um, standing around at parties making clever comments, and yeah, maybe I'm drunk but at least I give a damn about something bigger than myself.
