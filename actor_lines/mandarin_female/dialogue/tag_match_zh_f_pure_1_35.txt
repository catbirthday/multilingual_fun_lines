Character 1 [pure]: 诶我听说你升职了。太厉害了吧！

Character 2 [pure]: [困惑地] 等等，什么？天哪，你怎么—我是说，他们literally二十分钟前才告诉我！我自己都还，呃，还没缓过来呢。这太不真实了。

Character 1 [pure]: 你经理给我打电话了，想让我在你回来的时候在这儿等你。

Character 2 [pure]: 我的天，这—哇，好吧，她人真的太好了。我现在就是，嗯，整个人都飘着呢，你懂吧？就是身体在这儿但脑子已经飞到天上了，一直在想"我们真的做到了！"

Character 1 [pure]: 熬了三年终于熬出头了。

Character 2 [pure]: 三年七个月，呃，零十二天，不过谁在数呢？哈！天啊，我还记得躲在厕所隔间里哭，觉得自己一辈子都升不上去，结果现在—高级总监！我诶！

Character 1 [pure]: [欣喜地] 这是你应得的。

Character 2 [pure]: [愤怒地] 你知道吗？对，我他妈的就是应得的！那些周末加班，那些说我不够有战略眼光的混蛋—现在看看谁有战略眼光啊？不好意思，我就是，嗯，情绪有点上来了。

Character 1 [pure]: 发泄出来。这是你的时刻。

Character 2 [pure]: [哭着说] 我就是—真希望我爸能看到这一切，你知道吧？他一直相信我能干出点名堂，现在，呃，现在我真的做到了，可他不在了，没法跟我一起庆祝。

Character 1 [pure]: [含糊不清地] 他肯定特别为你骄傲的。

Character 2 [pure]: 是啊，他肯定会的。唉，我老想着给他打电话然后才想起来，但是，就是，有种奇怪的感觉他知道了？这听起来是不是很傻？

Character 1 [pure]: 一点都不傻。要不要开瓶香槟庆祝一下？

Character 2 [pure]: [无聊地] 行吧，可以搞个香槟什么的。不过说实话，呃，最开始的兴奋劲儿过了之后，这些公司庆祝不都一个样儿吗？开瓶酒，假笑，发LinkedIn。

Character 1 [pure]: 诶，别现在就开始犯cynical了。这是真实的成就。

Character 2 [pure]: [单调地] 对，不，你说得完全正确。这是一项重要的职业成就，我应该体验到适当程度的满足感。我的职业轨迹得到了可衡量的提升。

Character 1 [pure]: 好吧，你这是怎么了？

Character 2 [pure]: 对不起对不起！有时候情绪太多了我就，就是，直接关机变机器人了。这是什么防御机制之类的吧。但说真的？我他妈高兴得要炸了。

Character 1 [pure]: 这才对嘛。那，升任高级总监后第一件事是什么？

Character 2 [pure]: [懊悔地] 啊，这个嘛—我周一得开掉一个人。是的。升职的同时就得，呃，马上做艰难的决定，突然间所有的喜悦都变得有点沉重了，你懂吧？


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: So I heard you got the promotion. That's incredible news!

Character 2: [困惑地] Wait, what? Oh my god, how did you—I mean, they literally just told me like twenty minutes ago! I haven't even, uhh, processed it myself yet. This is so surreal.

Character 1: Your manager called me, wanted me to be here when you got back.

Character 2: Holy shit, that's—wow, okay, that's actually really sweet of her. I'm just, erhm, I'm kind of floating right now, you know? Like my body is here but my brain is somewhere in the stratosphere going "we actually did it!"

Character 1: Three years of grinding finally paid off.

Character 2: Three years, seven months, and, uh, twelve days, but who's counting? Ha! God, I remember crying in that bathroom stall thinking I'd never make it past entry level, and now look—senior director! Me!

Character 1: [欣喜地] You deserve every bit of this success.

Character 2: [愤怒地] You know what? Yeah, I fucking do! All those weekends, all those jerks who said I wasn't strategic enough—well, guess who's strategic now, huh? Sorry, I just, mmm, I have a lot of feelings bubbling up.

Character 1: Let it out. This is your moment.

Character 2: [哭着说] I just—I wish my dad could see this, you know? He always believed I'd do something big, and now, erhm, now I actually have, and he's not here to celebrate with me.

Character 1: [含糊不清地] He'd be sho proud of you right now.

Character 2: Yeah, he really would be. Oh man, I keep thinking about calling him and then remembering, but, like, in a weird way I feel like he knows? Does that sound crazy?

Character 1: Not at all. Want to grab champagne?

Character 2: [无聊地] Sure, I guess we could do the whole champagne thing. Though honestly, uhh, after the initial rush, these corporate celebrations all feel kind of the same, don't they? Pop bottle, fake smiles, LinkedIn posts.

Character 1: Hey, don't let cynicism creep in now. This is real.

Character 2: [单调地] Right, no, you're absolutely correct. This is a significant professional achievement and I should be experiencing appropriate levels of satisfaction. The trajectory of my career has improved measurably.

Character 1: Okay, what just happened there?

Character 2: Sorry, sorry! Sometimes when I get, like, too much emotion I just shut down and go robot mode. It's a defense mechanism or whatever. But honestly? I'm so fucking elated I could explode.

Character 1: There she is. So, first order of business as senior director?

Character 2: [懊悔地] Ah, well, that's the thing—I have to fire someone on Monday. Yeah. The promotion comes with, erhm, immediate tough decisions, and suddenly all this joy feels a bit heavier, you know?
