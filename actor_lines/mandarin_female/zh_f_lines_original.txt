============================================================

Character 1: The ice beneath me is, um, [weakening], turning red with blood that won't stop flowing, and I mean, my pack left me here to, [defeated], die alone after the hunters got me, well, three times in the chest.
1. [gentle] Such noble creatures always choose the most, [contemplative], poetic places to surrender their spirits, though I must admit your suffering seems, [examining], particularly acute tonight. [humming softly]
Character 1: You smell like, uhh, [frightened], sulfur and old promises, nothing like the forest spirits who usually, well, [trembling], come for the dying ones, I mean, you're something else entirely. [whimpers]
2. [accommodating] Indeed I am something else, something that can, [measured], offer you more than the cold embrace of death that's, [circling], creeping through your veins even as we, [sedating], speak.
Character 1: [labored] Every breath feels like swallowing, [painful], broken glass and my vision keeps, [fading], blurring into darkness but somehow you're still crystal clear.
3. [soothing] That's because, um, death cannot touch me, and well, [offering], neither would it need to touch you if you'd consider my proposition, I mean, eternal life has its appeals.
Character 1: [rasping] Um, what do you, well, want?
4. [patient] Simply a hunting companion who knows the, [thoughtful], wild places and can track souls across both earthly forests and darker realms. [chuckles softly]
Character 1: My mother warned me about, um, [desperate], making deals when the blood runs thin and the mind gets, well, [clouding], foggy from pain, but I mean, watching my own reflection fade in this ice feels like, [hollow], drowning in reverse. [coughs blood]
5. [understanding] Mothers always warn against me, though they rarely, [ironic], mention how their cubs will someday face choices between, [philosophical], dignity in death and purpose in damnation. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [struggling] Would I still, uhh, remember the taste of, well, rabbit bones and morning dew, or do you, I mean, take those simple pleasures too? [shivering]
6. [reassuring] You'd remember everything but, um, [careful], taste it differently, like how moonlight changes the, well, [mysterious], color of familiar paths without erasing them, you know, transformed rather than forgotten. [whispers]
Character 1: [defeated] Well, um, I accept.
7. [triumphant] The ice beneath you will, [transforming], crack in three heartbeats, and when you emerge from below, [reborn], you'll breathe water like air and hunt through, [darkening], dimensions your pack could never imagine. [laughs softly]
Character 1: [changing] The cold doesn't, err, [awakening], hurt anymore and my wounds are closing like flowers in reverse, but um, something ancient is, well, [growing], filling the spaces where my soul used to live.
8. [satisfied] That's the first lesson of your new, [teaching], existence—pain transforms into power when you stop, [revealing], fighting against the very thing reshaping you.
Character 1: [newfound] My eyes can suddenly see through the, [amazed], ice to the fish sleeping below and beyond them to souls drifting like, [haunted], underwater stars. [gasps]
9. [pleased] Welcome, hunter.
Character 1: [accepting] The forest will mourn the wolf I, [nostalgic], was while fearing the shadow I've, [transformed], become.
10. [final] Um, well, let them mourn. [laughs darkly]
Character 1: [confused] Hello? [pause]
11. [professional] Mr. Hernandez, my name is Sofia Martinez and I'm, [careful], calling from Apex Executive Search about a, [hesitant], position that might interest you based on your, [measured], extensive agricultural management experience.
Character 1: I think you have the, [confused], wrong person because I, um, just work the fields and, well, I don't know anything about, [nervous], executive nothing. [laughs nervously]
12. [trembling] Papa?
Character 1: [stunned] Sofia, my God, how did you, [breaking], find me after all these years when I couldn't even, [voice cracking], find the courage to find you?
13. [bitter] Well, um, it wasn't that hard when you've been using the same, [cold], social security number at every farm from California to, [sharp], Washington for twenty years, I mean, leaving a trail anyone could, um, follow if they really wanted to.
Character 1: [whispered] You became successful.
14. [controlled] I became what I had to become when my, [struggling], father disappeared one morning leaving only a note saying he'd, [hollow], send money that never came for, [breaking], sixteen years.
Character 1: [desperate] Every penny I could save went back but your mother, [ashamed], she sent it all back unopened. [sighs heavily]
15. [angry] She died eight years ago still, [shaking], waiting for you to walk through that door with your, [bitter], promises of a better life. [pause]
Character 1: The border patrol caught me, [defeated], three times trying to get back, um, and after the third deportation they said, well, if I tried again it would be, umm, ten years in prison. [voice breaking]
16. [softer] I hired a private investigator six months ago to, [careful], track you down because I needed to, [struggling], hear your voice say my name just, [trembling], once before I got married next spring. [long pause]
Character 1: [gentle] Sofia, mi amor, my little Sofia who used to, um, dance on my feet while I hummed your mother's favorite, [nostalgic], songs in our kitchen that, well, smelled like fresh tortillas every, umm, Sunday morning.
17. [crying] Don't do that, don't you, [angry], dare make me remember the father who taught me to, [breaking], be brave when all you did was teach me how to, [bitter], survive abandonment.
Character 1: [pleading] Let me see you just once, even from, [desperate], across a restaurant where you don't have to speak to me or, [begging], acknowledge that this broken fieldworker is your father. [sobs quietly]
18. The position I called about was, [steady], never real but this headhunting company I built from, [proud], nothing does have an office in Fresno where I'll be next, [uncertain], Thursday at noon.
Character 1: That's ninety miles from here but I'll, [determined], walk if I have to.
19. [firm] The security guard will have your name and, um, there's a coffee shop on the, [wavering], first floor where we can, well, sit for exactly one hour to, umm, see if twenty years can fit into sixty minutes.
Character 1: [hopeful] I still remember how you take your coffee with two, [tender], sugars and just a drop of milk, um, unless that changed too along with, well, everything else I missed. [pause]
20. Some things never, [quiet], change Papa. [hangs up softly]
Character 1: [steady] I've changed locks after break-ins before, but, [gentle], this feels different because it's a school, [careful], where kids should feel safe.
21. [exhausted] Yeah, um, I keep thinking about Marcus and, [pained], how I should have seen this coming, you know?
Character 1: [thoughtful] Well, uh, from what you've told me, [understanding], you did everything you could to help that boy, [reassuring], and sometimes people just, [trailing off], make choices we can't control.
22. [defensive] But I'm supposed to protect these kids, [breaking], all of them, even the ones who leave.
Character 1: [firm] Listen, um, I've seen plenty of situations where good people, [measured], blame themselves for things that aren't their fault, you know?
23. The thing is, uh, Marcus was brilliant, [wistful], but so angry underneath all that potential, I mean.
Character 1: [soft] Well, changing these locks, [purposeful], it's not about keeping him out forever, it's about, [hopeful], giving everyone time to heal and, um, maybe find a way forward.
24. [surprised] I hadn't, um, thought about it that way, [contemplative], like we're not closing a door permanently but, [realizing], just pausing to, uh, reset everything.
Character 1: [working] These new locks I'm installing, [explaining], they're the kind that can be reprogrammed, [meaningful], so when you're ready, when he's ready, access can change.
25. [quiet] Um, thank you.
Character 1: [focused] You know, I've been doing this for twenty years, [reflective], and the hardest locks to open aren't on doors, [philosophical], they're the ones people put around their hearts.
26. [emotional] Marcus put those locks there himself after his father left, [remembering], and I tried so hard to find the right key, [regretful], but some doors only open from the inside.
Character 1: [wise] That's exactly right, and, [encouraging], maybe this incident is his way of rattling the handle, [optimistic], asking if anyone still cares enough to answer.
27. You really think, um, this could be, [uncertain], a cry for help rather than, well, an attack?
Character 1: [confident] In my experience, uh, people who break into places they used to belong, [knowing], are usually looking for something they lost there, um.
28. [tearful] He left his graduation tassel in the trophy case, [remembering], the one he earned despite everything, [proud], and I kept it there hoping he'd come back for it properly, you know?
Character 1: [gentle] Well then, maybe these new locks, [thoughtful], aren't about keeping him out but, um, about making sure when he comes back, it's through the front door.
29. [decided] I'm going to, um, call his mother tomorrow and, [determined], see if we can arrange a proper meeting, you know?
Character 1: [warm] That's good.
30. [grateful] You've given me more than new locks tonight, [sincere], you've, well, helped me see this whole situation differently, I mean.
Character 1: [bitter] You always show up when things are, [shaky voice], already falling apart, reminding me of every single mistake I've, [exhausted], made along the way.
31. I only have seconds to, [warm], exist before I burn away completely, yet here I am, [gently], spending them with you instead of just, [cheerful], blazing past in silence. [sigh]
Character 1: Why would something as magnificent as you, [confused], waste even a moment on someone who can't stop, [frustrated], tearing themselves down from the inside?
32. [whispering] Because you called me.
Character 1: [hesitantly] I didn't mean to, um, summon anything tonight, I was just, [crying while speaking], sitting here thinking about, well, how everything I touch seems to, you know, fall apart.
33. [empathetically] Every wish made upon me carries that same, [relieved], desperate hope that things might change, that tomorrow could somehow be different.
Character 1: Wishes are for dreamers. [pause]
34. [softly spoken] But you're still here, um, watching the sky at three in the morning, which means, [passionately], somewhere beneath all that self-hatred you're, like, still hoping for something, even if you won't, [anxious], admit it to yourself, you know? [trailing off]
Character 1: [very quietly] Maybe I'm just, um, really good at punishing myself by, [melancholic], staying awake with all these thoughts that won't stop, [slowly], circling like vultures waiting for me to, well, finally give up.
35. [animated] Listen, I mean, I travel through darkness at thousands of miles per hour and, [excited], still manage to create light that people, um, remember for years, so maybe, [friendly], your darkness isn't as permanent as you, like, think it is.
Character 1: You get to disappear after, um, blazing brilliantly for a few seconds while I'm, [angry], stuck here replaying every failure on an endless, [trembling], loop that never stops no matter how hard I try to, well, silence it or, you know, pretend it's not there.
36. The friction that makes me burn so bright is the same, [curious], force that's trying to destroy me, yet without it I'd just be, [playful], another cold rock floating invisibly through space.
Character 1: That's supposed to make me feel better about being, [sarcastic], torn apart by my own thoughts every single day while watching everyone else, [very sad], seemingly float through life without this constant, [jealous], internal war?
37. [appreciative] Your pain creates depth that shallow happiness, [sincere], never could, and maybe that's why you can see me when others just, [mocking], see pretty lights they immediately forget.
Character 1: [regretful] Sometimes I wonder if I've become so comfortable with this, [upset], inner darkness that I wouldn't know how to exist without it constantly, [bored], telling me I'm not enough.
38. [formal] Here's what I know for certain.
Character 1: [flirtatious] A shooting star is going to give me, [hopeful], life advice now?
39. [confidently] In my brief existence, I've witnessed millions of people making wishes, [delighted], and the ones who hurt the most always wish for others' happiness, [apologetic], never their own.
Character 1: [whispering loudly] Well, um, maybe that's because we, er, know what pain feels like.
40. Before I disappear completely, remember that even, [shy], the darkest night sky needs its shadows to make the, [overly polite], stars visible, and perhaps your inner critic exists not to, [stern], destroy you but to make your light more meaningful. [long pause]
41. [nervous] I don't know if you remember me, but, um, I've been trying to find you for—well, honestly, for months now. [clearing throat] My name is Sarah Chen, and you, [shaky voice] you saved my life five years ago. June 14th, 2019. [pause] I was the, uh, the car accident victim who came in with—God, I mean, they told me later I was basically dying when the ambulance brought me in. [emotional] Internal bleeding, collapsed lung, the whole thing was just... [trailing off]

[warm] You probably don't even remember because I'm sure you save so many people, but like, [speeding up] you held my hand when I was terrified, and you kept telling me I was going to see my daughter graduate, and I did! [excited] She graduated last month! Pre-med, actually, because of you. [laugh] 

I know this is, er, kind of weird, me showing up at your hospital like this, [hesitantly] but the thing is, I needed to—I had to tell you that, [very sincerely] because of what you did that night, I got to be there for everything. Her prom, her college acceptance, all of it. [crying while speaking] You gave me my life back when I was literally dying on that table. [sniffle] So, anyway, I just... [happy] thank you doesn't even begin to cover it, but thank you.
42. [bitter] They finally got him. Um, three years of wearing wires, meeting in parking garages at 2 AM, and they finally—I mean, Martinez is done. [laugh] Funny thing is, I thought I'd feel... I don't know, vindicated? But it's like, the whole time I'm testifying, [very sad] all these other cops are just staring at me like I'm the criminal. And honestly, half of them knew. They all fucking knew what he was doing—the bribes, the evidence tampering, [angry] everything—and they just, you know, looked the other way.

[long pause] 

So yeah, he's going to prison. Probably. Unless his lawyer finds some technicality because, well, that's how it always goes, right? [sarcastic] The system works. Except it doesn't. It's just—here's the thing, [very quietly] I thought I was doing the right thing. Like, genuinely believed that if I just... if I got proof, then justice would, er, happen. [frustrated] But watching them protect each other, seeing how they tried to bury my testimony, how they made ME look like the bad guy for not, what, staying silent? 

[exhausted] I can't even look at a badge anymore without feeling sick. Literally. They got their conviction but, [trailing off] I don't even know what I believe in anymore...
