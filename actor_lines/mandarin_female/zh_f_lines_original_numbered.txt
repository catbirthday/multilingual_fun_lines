# Speaker Lines Only (Original English) - Mandarin Chinese (Female)
============================================================

1. [gentle] Such noble creatures always choose the most, [contemplative], poetic places to surrender their spirits, though I must admit your suffering seems, [examining], particularly acute tonight. [humming softly]
2. [accommodating] Indeed I am something else, something that can, [measured], offer you more than the cold embrace of death that's, [circling], creeping through your veins even as we, [sedating], speak.
3. [soothing] That's because, um, death cannot touch me, and well, [offering], neither would it need to touch you if you'd consider my proposition, I mean, eternal life has its appeals.
4. [patient] Simply a hunting companion who knows the, [thoughtful], wild places and can track souls across both earthly forests and darker realms. [chuckles softly]
5. [understanding] Mothers always warn against me, though they rarely, [ironic], mention how their cubs will someday face choices between, [philosophical], dignity in death and purpose in damnation. [sighs deeply]
6. [reassuring] You'd remember everything but, um, [careful], taste it differently, like how moonlight changes the, well, [mysterious], color of familiar paths without erasing them, you know, transformed rather than forgotten. [whispers]
7. [triumphant] The ice beneath you will, [transforming], crack in three heartbeats, and when you emerge from below, [reborn], you'll breathe water like air and hunt through, [darkening], dimensions your pack could never imagine. [laughs softly]
8. [satisfied] That's the first lesson of your new, [teaching], existence—pain transforms into power when you stop, [revealing], fighting against the very thing reshaping you.
9. [pleased] Welcome, hunter.
10. [final] Um, well, let them mourn. [laughs darkly]
11. [professional] Mr. Hernandez, my name is Sofia Martinez and I'm, [careful], calling from Apex Executive Search about a, [hesitant], position that might interest you based on your, [measured], extensive agricultural management experience.
12. [trembling] Papa?
13. [bitter] Well, um, it wasn't that hard when you've been using the same, [cold], social security number at every farm from California to, [sharp], Washington for twenty years, I mean, leaving a trail anyone could, um, follow if they really wanted to.
14. [controlled] I became what I had to become when my, [struggling], father disappeared one morning leaving only a note saying he'd, [hollow], send money that never came for, [breaking], sixteen years.
15. [angry] She died eight years ago still, [shaking], waiting for you to walk through that door with your, [bitter], promises of a better life. [pause]
16. [softer] I hired a private investigator six months ago to, [careful], track you down because I needed to, [struggling], hear your voice say my name just, [trembling], once before I got married next spring. [long pause]
17. [crying] Don't do that, don't you, [angry], dare make me remember the father who taught me to, [breaking], be brave when all you did was teach me how to, [bitter], survive abandonment.
18. The position I called about was, [steady], never real but this headhunting company I built from, [proud], nothing does have an office in Fresno where I'll be next, [uncertain], Thursday at noon.
19. [firm] The security guard will have your name and, um, there's a coffee shop on the, [wavering], first floor where we can, well, sit for exactly one hour to, umm, see if twenty years can fit into sixty minutes.
20. Some things never, [quiet], change Papa. [hangs up softly]
21. [exhausted] Yeah, um, I keep thinking about Marcus and, [pained], how I should have seen this coming, you know?
22. [defensive] But I'm supposed to protect these kids, [breaking], all of them, even the ones who leave.
23. The thing is, uh, Marcus was brilliant, [wistful], but so angry underneath all that potential, I mean.
24. [surprised] I hadn't, um, thought about it that way, [contemplative], like we're not closing a door permanently but, [realizing], just pausing to, uh, reset everything.
25. [quiet] Um, thank you.
26. [emotional] Marcus put those locks there himself after his father left, [remembering], and I tried so hard to find the right key, [regretful], but some doors only open from the inside.
27. You really think, um, this could be, [uncertain], a cry for help rather than, well, an attack?
28. [tearful] He left his graduation tassel in the trophy case, [remembering], the one he earned despite everything, [proud], and I kept it there hoping he'd come back for it properly, you know?
29. [decided] I'm going to, um, call his mother tomorrow and, [determined], see if we can arrange a proper meeting, you know?
30. [grateful] You've given me more than new locks tonight, [sincere], you've, well, helped me see this whole situation differently, I mean.
31. I only have seconds to, [warm], exist before I burn away completely, yet here I am, [gently], spending them with you instead of just, [cheerful], blazing past in silence. [sigh]
32. [whispering] Because you called me.
33. [empathetically] Every wish made upon me carries that same, [relieved], desperate hope that things might change, that tomorrow could somehow be different.
34. [softly spoken] But you're still here, um, watching the sky at three in the morning, which means, [passionately], somewhere beneath all that self-hatred you're, like, still hoping for something, even if you won't, [anxious], admit it to yourself, you know? [trailing off]
35. [animated] Listen, I mean, I travel through darkness at thousands of miles per hour and, [excited], still manage to create light that people, um, remember for years, so maybe, [friendly], your darkness isn't as permanent as you, like, think it is.
36. The friction that makes me burn so bright is the same, [curious], force that's trying to destroy me, yet without it I'd just be, [playful], another cold rock floating invisibly through space.
37. [appreciative] Your pain creates depth that shallow happiness, [sincere], never could, and maybe that's why you can see me when others just, [mocking], see pretty lights they immediately forget.
38. [formal] Here's what I know for certain.
39. [confidently] In my brief existence, I've witnessed millions of people making wishes, [delighted], and the ones who hurt the most always wish for others' happiness, [apologetic], never their own.
40. Before I disappear completely, remember that even, [shy], the darkest night sky needs its shadows to make the, [overly polite], stars visible, and perhaps your inner critic exists not to, [stern], destroy you but to make your light more meaningful. [long pause]
41. [nervous] I don't know if you remember me, but, um, I've been trying to find you for—well, honestly, for months now. [clearing throat] My name is Sarah Chen, and you, [shaky voice] you saved my life five years ago. June 14th, 2019. [pause] I was the, uh, the car accident victim who came in with—God, I mean, they told me later I was basically dying when the ambulance brought me in. [emotional] Internal bleeding, collapsed lung, the whole thing was just... [trailing off]

[warm] You probably don't even remember because I'm sure you save so many people, but like, [speeding up] you held my hand when I was terrified, and you kept telling me I was going to see my daughter graduate, and I did! [excited] She graduated last month! Pre-med, actually, because of you. [laugh] 

I know this is, er, kind of weird, me showing up at your hospital like this, [hesitantly] but the thing is, I needed to—I had to tell you that, [very sincerely] because of what you did that night, I got to be there for everything. Her prom, her college acceptance, all of it. [crying while speaking] You gave me my life back when I was literally dying on that table. [sniffle] So, anyway, I just... [happy] thank you doesn't even begin to cover it, but thank you.
42. [bitter] They finally got him. Um, three years of wearing wires, meeting in parking garages at 2 AM, and they finally—I mean, Martinez is done. [laugh] Funny thing is, I thought I'd feel... I don't know, vindicated? But it's like, the whole time I'm testifying, [very sad] all these other cops are just staring at me like I'm the criminal. And honestly, half of them knew. They all fucking knew what he was doing—the bribes, the evidence tampering, [angry] everything—and they just, you know, looked the other way.

[long pause] 

So yeah, he's going to prison. Probably. Unless his lawyer finds some technicality because, well, that's how it always goes, right? [sarcastic] The system works. Except it doesn't. It's just—here's the thing, [very quietly] I thought I was doing the right thing. Like, genuinely believed that if I just... if I got proof, then justice would, er, happen. [frustrated] But watching them protect each other, seeing how they tried to bury my testimony, how they made ME look like the bad guy for not, what, staying silent? 

[exhausted] I can't even look at a badge anymore without feeling sick. Literally. They got their conviction but, [trailing off] I don't even know what I believe in anymore...
