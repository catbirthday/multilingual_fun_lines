Customer: So um, I just saw my credit limit was... cut? Like, from ten thousand to basically... um, three?
1. Oh, um, I'm—I'm really sorry to hear about that, let me just, uh, pull up your account here... okay so I'm seeing account number ACC-7739-BK21 and, um, yes I can see the—the adjustment that was made, I mean, er, the credit limit change on October 15th.
Customer: October fifteenth. And nobody thought to, uh... tell me about this?
2. I'm so—I'm really sorry about the, um, the communication issue there, that's definitely not—I mean we should have—let me check if there was supposed to be, uh, an email sent... okay so it shows notification ID NTF-882294 was, er, generated but I'm not seeing a delivery confirmation which is, um, concerning.
Customer: So basically you're telling me that, um, your system just... didn't work. Great.
3. Right right.
Customer: Um, can you just, like, tell me WHY this happened? I've been a customer for, uh, twelve years, never missed a... wait no, thirteen years.
4. Of course, um, let me—so I'm looking at the, uh, the review notes here and, er, it looks like there was an automated risk assessment on, um, September 30th, reference number REF-5521-QM, and it—well it flagged some, uh, some changes in your credit utilization patterns across, I mean, not just our card but...
Customer: Changes in my... what changes? I use it the same way I always—
5. So the—I'm sorry, let me just—the system is showing, um, increased utilization on external accounts, and, uh, there were three new credit inquiries in August which, er, triggered our review process under policy code POL-7782-A.
Customer: Three inquiries because I was, um, refinancing my mortgage! That's not—do you know how much I spend with you people every year?
6. I completely—I understand your frustration and, um, I can see you're one of our, uh, our valued customers with, er, let me see... lifetime spending of—oh wow, um, significant amount here in transaction history TXN-9982743 through TXN-9997856.
Customer: Uh, so can you just... fix this then? Like, now?
7. I wish I could just—um, I mean the system doesn't let me directly override but, er, what I can do is—let me submit an expedited review request, that's form FRM-3387-EX, and, uh, normally these take five to seven business days but I'm marking it as priority.
Customer: Five to seven... I need my regular limit back, um, tomorrow. I have business expenses that—
8. Okay okay.
Customer: Look, just, uh... transfer me to someone who can actually, like, do something about this.
9. I—I understand and, um, I can definitely escalate this to our, er, credit review specialists but, uh, they're going to need to do the same review process using case number CSE-4429-RV71, it's just that they have, um, slightly more options for temporary adjustments while the review is pending.
Customer: Slightly more options. Um, fine, whatever, just... do that then.
10. Of course, I'm, uh, initiating the transfer now and, er, I'm adding detailed notes to ticket TKT-8837-LP so they'll have all the—the context about your, um, your concerns and the refinancing situation, and I'm really sorry again about this whole...
Customer: Um, hello, I'm so sorry to bother you but, uh, I think I made a mistake on your website?
11. Oh no worries at all! So, um, let me just... pull up your account here and, uh, we'll get this sorted right away. Can you, um, tell me what happened?
Customer: Well, let me see here... I was trying to order this, um, this sweater for my grandson and hmm, I think I clicked something twice?
12. Okay okay, so basically, um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, look up any recent orders you've placed. And, um, if you have your email handy? I can, like, search that way and make sure we catch everything.
Customer: Oh I'm just... I'm sorry, I'm not very good with computers. It's, uh, it's margaret.rose at gmail.
13. Perfect! So, um, I'm seeing here... oh! Yeah, so basically you've got, uh, two orders here. Order number ORD-4429-BK and, um, another one that's ORD-4431-BK. Both for the, uh, navy blue sweater in size medium. Is that what happened?
Customer: Yes! Um, that's exactly it. I didn't mean to, I just, er, the button didn't seem to work so I clicked again.
14. So, um, here's what I'm gonna do for you, and like, I want to make sure this never happens again, okay? First thing, uh, I'm canceling that duplicate order right now. The second one, ORD-4431-BK.
Customer: Oh thank goodness. So that means, um, I'll only be charged once then?
15. Exactly! So, um, you'll only be charged for the first order. And, uh, here's what else I'm doing... I'm adding a note to your account, RCP-88291-Q, that basically, um, flags any duplicate orders in the future. So like, the system will catch it automatically.
Customer: That's very kind but, hmm, what if I actually want to order two of something next time?
16. Oh that's, um, that's such a good question! So basically, uh, if you intentionally order multiples, you can just, um, change the quantity in your cart. But if two separate orders come through, like, within five minutes? The system will, uh, send you a confirmation email first.
Customer: Um, okay so that means... I should wait for an email if it happens again?
17. Yes! And, um, you know what? I'm also gonna, uh, make sure to send you a confirmation for this cancellation. So like, you'll get an email with reference number CFM-7264-MRX in about, um, five minutes or so.
Customer: I'm sorry, I'm just... er, worried because last time I ordered online somewhere else, um, they still charged me twice.
18. So, um, I totally understand that concern. And like, here's what I want you to know... if you see, uh, if you see any double charge on your statement? You call us immediately. I'm putting a priority flag, um, PRT-9983-Z on your account right now.
Customer: Oh, well that's... hmm, that's actually really reassuring. Um, thank you for being so patient with me.
19. Are you kidding? You're, um, you're doing great! And honestly, uh, this happens like... so many times a day. The website should be, um, clearer about when an order goes through. I'm actually gonna, uh, submit feedback about that using ticket TKT-4401-WG.
Customer: Well, um, next time I'll know to just wait a moment and, er, check my email first I suppose.
20. Exactly! And, um, remember that reference number I gave you? CFM-7264-MRX? So basically, uh, keep that just in case, but you should be, like, totally fine. Your grandson's gonna, um, love that sweater!
Customer: Um, look. Need my 401k. Now. Uh, how fast?
21. Okay okay, so let me just—let me pull up your account here, um, I'll need to verify some information first, and then we can, uh, we can definitely discuss your withdrawal options, just one moment while I access the system...
Customer: No no. Um. How. Fast. Er, just tell me days.
22. Right, so, um, typically—typically it's going to be, uh, five to seven business days for processing, but that's—sorry, I mean that's after we submit the request which, um, which takes about two days itself, so you're looking at maybe, hmm, nine days total?
Customer: Nine?! Uh, that's... Let me think here. Rent's due. Um, Monday.
23. I understand, I—I really do understand the urgency here, and um, between you and me? There might be a way to, uh, to expedite this a bit, your account number is RET-401K-88293-W and I can see you've been contributing for, hmm, six years?
Customer: Six years. Yeah. So? Um, faster how?
24. Well, so, um, if we process this as a—as a hardship withdrawal instead of a standard one, uh, we can get that down to, hmm, let me check here, three to four days with form HRD-2847-A, but you'd need to, um, provide some documentation...
Customer: Okay so wait. Um. Hardship. Er, what counts?
25. Right right, so, uh, eviction prevention definitely—definitely qualifies, and I can see in your file here, account RET-88293-W shows, um, consistent contributions, so you'd qualify for up to, hmm, let me calculate, up to $14,500 immediate access...
Customer: Fourteen... Hmm, okay so that means... Um. Yeah. Need it.
26. Perfect, so—so what I'm going to do here is, um, I'm going to email you form HRD-2847-A right now, and uh, here's the thing, if you can get that back to me within, hmm, within the next two hours? I can slip it into today's batch...
Customer: Two hours?! I'm... Er, I'm at work. Warehouse. Can't just—
27. Okay okay, I hear you, um, let me—sorry, let me think here... What if, uh, what if I pre-fill most of it for you using the information from RET-88293-W, and you just, um, you just need to sign and attach one document, maybe a—a rent notice or utility bill?
Customer: Um, yeah. Okay. So just sign? Er... That's it?
28. Well, hmm, mostly yes, but—but I should mention, um, there's a ten percent penalty for early withdrawal, so on $14,500 you'd lose, uh, $1,450, plus um, plus taxes, but given your situation...
Customer: Right. Penalties. Course there are. Um. Whatever. Send it.
29. Already—already sending now to your email on file, and um, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm putting a priority flag PRI-EXPEDITE-7739 on your account, so when it comes back, uh, it'll jump the queue, technically I'm not supposed to but, hmm, you sound like you really need this...
Customer: Yeah I... Hmm, thank you. Really. Um, next time I'll plan better.
30. No no, hey, we all—we all hit rough patches, and um, that's exactly what this money is for, your confirmation number is CNF-401K-293847-EXP, and uh, once you submit that form, you should have funds by, hmm, Thursday latest, possibly Wednesday if everything processes smoothly...
Customer: Um, hi, I'm calling about a—a payment that, uh, that didn't go through?
31. Oh okay. Let me just—so basically I can pull that up for you. What's your account number or—actually, you know what, phone number works too.
Customer: It's, um, it's 555-0812. I—I run a carpet cleaning business.
32. Perfect, so... okay. Got it. Account ACC-7294-CP here and I'm seeing—oh. Right. So there was a payment attempt on, um, November 15th for $487.23 that, uh, didn't process.
Customer: Yeah, yeah, I know, um, this is so embarrassing, I—I just need to fix it.
33. No no, totally fine. Happens all the time. So basically what I need to do is—let me just—we can reprocess that today with a different card if you want?
Customer: Um, can I just, uh, use the same card? I—I deposited money yesterday.
34. Absolutely, so... hmm. Let me check. The card ending in 4782? I can run that again but, um, just so you know, if it bounces twice there's a—well, there's like a $35 fee that gets added to invoice INV-2847-NOV.
Customer: Thirty-five? That's—that's on top of what I already owe?
35. Yeah so—I mean, I'm really sorry about that—it's basically bank policy and I don't—let me see if I can—actually no, I can't waive it ahead of time. But. If it goes through. No fee.
Customer: Okay okay okay, um, just—just run it. I need my supplies account active.
36. Got it. Processing now. So this takes about... fifteen seconds? Maybe twenty? And your confirmation will be—oh wait, is your email still carpetcleanpro at gmail?
Customer: Um, yeah, that's—that's right. Is it, uh, is it going through?
37. Still processing, just... okay. Okay okay. So good news—transaction approved! Your new confirmation is TRX-98274-APPROVED and, um, your account is fully active again.
Customer: Oh thank god, um, I'm—I'm so sorry about this whole mess.
38. Seriously don't—I mean, like I said, this happens literally all the time. So basically your next auto-payment is, uh, December 15th for the same amount, reference REC-DEC-7294.
Customer: Right right, um, and my—my discount still applies? The contractor one?
39. Let me just... verify that. One sec. So your account shows—yeah, 15% contractor discount is still active under code CONT-2024-CARPET15, and that's, um, that's permanent as long as you maintain the account.
Customer: Perfect, um, thanks for—for being patient with me, I just, uh, it's been a rough week.
40. Oh totally understand. Been there. So you're all set—receipt's going to your email with reference RCP-112024-7294 and, um, if you need anything else just—you know, we're here. Have a good one.
Customer: Um, yeah, so I need to, uh, close an account—no wait, not close—um, transfer it or whatever you do when someone dies.
41. Oh. Oh I see. I'm—let me just—I'm so sorry. For your loss. Let me. Pull up. The appropriate forms. Case number BRV-88342-Q.
Customer: Can we just, um, get through this quickly? I've got—no, sorry, I have a lot to handle right now.
42. Of course of course. I think—no wait—actually I'll need. Some information first. Um. The account holder's name? And, uh, your relationship?
Customer: Martha Coleman. My mother. Look, how long is this going to take?
43. So, um, I think—probably—well it's sort of, uh, there's a process. But I'll—I'll make this. As quick as possible. Need the, um, account number? ACC-7749302-MK if you, uh, if you have it?
Customer: ACC-7749—wait, that's the checking, right? Or is that—no, checking is 7749302.
44. Right right. Um, so I need to, uh, verify—I mean, sort of confirm you're, um, authorized? Death certificate. Reference number DOC-5571-XR9. You'll need to, uh, upload that.
Customer: Um, yeah, I have it here somewhere, uh, can I just—wait, upload where exactly?
45. I'll—let me just—sending a secure link. To your email. Portal ID PTL-883290-B. Should arrive. In about. Two minutes.
Customer: Two minutes? No, I mean—sorry, can't you just, um, take the information now? Like, over the phone?
46. I think—no actually—legally we need. The document. Compliance code CMP-4428-YT requires. Physical documentation. Or digital upload.
Customer: This is ridiculous. Do you know how much money she had with you people?
47. I—I understand. This is. Um. Difficult. I'm just—I'm trying to, uh, to help. Within the, um, the regulations? It's it's not—I mean, I wish I could—
Customer: Whatever. Fine. Send your link. But this better not take weeks to process.
48. No no no. Once we, um, once we get the—uh, the certificate? Processing is, um, usually three to five—I mean, uh, business days. Reference timeline TML-9902.
Customer: Three to—wait no, you said three to five? That's not—I was told same day when I, uh, when I called yesterday.
49. Yesterday? Let me. Check the notes. Hmm. Ticket number TKT-445831-LP shows. Expedited processing. For accounts over. Certain thresholds.
Customer: So, um, then it IS same day? Or—no wait, are you saying, uh, her account doesn't qualify?
50. Actually—let me just—you're right. You're right. Account qualifies. For priority. Same day. Once documents are. Verified. It's going to be okay. I promise.
Customer: Oh thank god. I'm sorry. I think I... the website kept. Um. Crashing?
51. No worries at all, so basically this has been happening all morning—our main server cluster went down around 9 AM. Let me pull up your account real quick, what's your email address?
Customer: It's... I probably did something wrong. Maybe clicked too many times?
52. Definitely not your fault, like, we've had over 300 reports since breakfast. So what I'm seeing here is your session ID SES-44219-BK got interrupted seventeen times—that's basically a record for today.
Customer: Seventeen? Oh god. I'm sorry. I just kept... trying.
53. Hey no no, that's exactly what you should do. So your account ACC-7263-MP shows you were trying to access your recent order, is that right?
Customer: Yes. Kind of. I mean probably that's... I need to check if. The delivery?
54. Got it, so I can see order ORD-9847-TL22 here, scheduled for tomorrow. But like, here's the thing—because of all these crashes, we're actually upgrading everyone affected to expedited shipping, no charge.
Customer: Wait really? I don't. You don't have to. I mean I'm just...
55. No listen, we're going to fix this properly. Your confirmation code is now EXP-7749-RK and basically that means guaranteed delivery by 10 AM tomorrow, and I'm adding a credit of $25 to your account.
Customer: That's... I think that's too much? Maybe just. The website working is enough.
56. Look, you tried seventeen times to get through, so like, that's persistence we need to reward. Reference number for the credit is CRD-2024-8837-A.
Customer: I'm being silly. Probably everyone's calling. Sort of taking your time.
57. You're literally my favorite call today because you're so nice about it. So basically while I have you, let me check if there's anything else affected on account ACC-7263-MP... yeah, your wishlist is intact, payment methods are all good.
Customer: Oh. Thank god. I thought maybe I... lost everything?
58. Nope, everything's safe, so like all your data is backed up every hour. Your last successful save was at 8:47 AM, reference timestamp TS-084747-EST.
Customer: I just. Really needed this order. Kind of important. Sorry.
59. Hey, no apologizing, that's why we're fixing it. So I'm putting a priority flag PRI-HIGH-7263 on your account, basically means if you have ANY issues tomorrow with delivery, you call and ask for me directly—name's Jordan, employee ID EMP-4472.
Customer: That's so. I mean. Thank you? I think I'm just. Relieved.
60. Totally understand, like this morning was rough for everyone. So your updated tracking number is TRK-9847-EXPR-22 and basically you'll get texts every step of the way. We're going to make sure this gets to you perfectly, okay?
Character 1: Um, I've been staring at this Monet painting for, like, twenty minutes and I [sad] still don't get it, you know, it's just blurry flowers.
61. Oh, that's actually the whole point of impressionism - they weren't trying to paint perfect photographic details, they were capturing the feeling of a moment, the way light dances on water lilies at a specific time of day.
Character 1: So, wait, they basically made it blurry on purpose? I mean, that seems kind of... er, lazy?
62. Not lazy at all! These artists spent years studying how our eyes actually perceive color and light - they discovered that shadows aren't just gray or black, they're filled with reflected colors from everything around them.
Character 1: Hmm, I guess when you put it that way, actually, it's more like they were, uhh, scientists or something?
63. Well, they were definitely revolutionaries, though I suppose [sarcastic] the stuffy Academy painters of the time would've said, you know, they were just rebels who couldn't, um, draw properly.
Character 1: Actually, I'm [very sincerely] starting to see it now, like, the way the water kind of, err, shimmers when you don't focus directly on it.
64. Exactly! And here's what's really cool - Monet painted the same haystacks and cathedral facades dozens of times, but at different times of day and seasons, showing how the same subject completely transforms with changing light.
Character 1: Uh, that's honestly pretty obsessive, I mean, painting the same thing over and over, you know?
65. Right so, it might seem obsessive, but basically he was documenting something nobody had really, hmm, paid attention to before - how our perception of reality changes constantly throughout the day.
Character 1: Did other impressionists do that too, or was it just Monet being weird?
66. They all had their own approaches - Renoir focused on people and the joy of modern life, Degas was obsessed with movement and dancers, Caillebotte painted urban scenes from these crazy dramatic angles nobody had tried before.
Character 1: Speaking of Degas, [cough], weren't his ballet paintings kind of creepy though?
67. Okay so, that's a fair point, and honestly, [regretful] the way he depicted young dancers, um, there's definitely some uncomfortable power dynamics there that modern viewers, you know, rightfully question.
Character 1: It's just that, well, I read somewhere he was, er, hanging around backstage all the time, sort of watching them.
68. Yeah, the thing is, he had special access that, uhh, most people didn't have, and anyway, his work does capture this behind-the-scenes exhaustion and reality that, hmm, wasn't typically shown in art.
Character 1: So impressionism wasn't all pretty gardens and sunny days then?
69. Not at all - Toulouse-Lautrec painted brothels and cabarets, Caillebotte showed rain-soaked streets and urban isolation, and even Monet's later works get pretty abstract and almost turbulent.
Character 1: I think I want to see more of these paintings now, especially the weird ones.
70. That's the spirit! Once you understand they were trying to paint sensation itself rather than just copying what they saw, the whole movement becomes this incredible experiment in human perception.
Character 1: [hollow] I found something, um, inside the violin that I think, [trembling], you need to see, something that, well, shouldn't be there and I mean, [quieter], it's making me question everything about Mrs. Chen. [exhales]
71. This USB drive has military-grade encryption that, [stunned], hasn't been used since 2017 and only three organizations in the world had access to this particular protocol.
Character 1: Um, well, I don't know.
72. [careful] The metadata shows these files were, [measured], last modified two days before she died, which means she was, [darker], actively working on something that required this level of security right up until, [trailing off], the accident.
Character 1: Um, she just seemed like a lonely old woman who, [breaking], wanted her grandmother's violin restored, I mean, we talked about music for hours, about Brahms, about her childhood in Vienna.
73. [restrained] Well, I've seen this encryption signature before, um, in cases involving, [uncomfortable], international espionage, and I mean, the fact that she hid it inside an instrument suggests she knew, [grave], someone was watching her.
Character 1: [despairing] So, um, all those afternoons she spent in my workshop, well, watching me work while telling stories about her life, I mean, [hollow], none of that was real, was it, [defeated], she was just using me. [sighs heavily]
74. [gentle] People can be multiple things at once, um, and her appreciation for your craftsmanship seemed, [thoughtful], genuine even if she had, well, other motives for choosing you specifically, I mean, [softer], for trusting you with this. [pause]
Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, I spent three months bringing that violin back to life, you know, replacing the sound post, regraduating the top plate, and, [disgusted], now I find out it was just, I mean, [exhausted], a hiding place for whatever nightmare she was running from.
75. [clinical] Um, there's something else you should know, well, the encryption key appears to be, [hesitant], tied to specific frequencies, and I think, [realization dawning], the violin itself might be the key, I mean, certain notes played in sequence.
Character 1: [stunned] The Brahms sonata she kept, [disbelieving], humming while I worked, the one she said her grandmother played, [shaking], during the war to keep children calm in bomb shelters.
76. [excited] That could be it, the frequency pattern from that, [focused], specific piece might unlock these files and reveal whatever she was, [tense], protecting or hiding.
Character 1: [resigned] She left me a recording of herself playing it, said it was, [emotional], payment for the restoration work since her accounts were, [quieter], frozen after her death, but now I realize it was probably, [despairing], instructions.
77. [urgent] We need to analyze that recording immediately because whoever else is, [worried], looking for these files won't stop just because she's, [grim], dead, and they might already know about, [fearful], you.
Character 1: I mean, there have been people asking questions at the shop lately, um, about her violin, about whether she left anything else behind, well, [disturbed], I thought they were just estate collectors.
78. [firm] Pack whatever you need because, um, we're moving you somewhere safe while I work on, [determined], cracking this. [decisive]
Character 1: The violin is still in my workshop, sitting on, [anguished], the bench where she used to watch me work, where we talked about, [broken], everything except what actually mattered.
79. [quiet] I'll send someone to retrieve it, um, discreetly, but I mean, right now we need to, [urgent], leave before they connect you to those files. [stands]
Character 1: This morning I was worried about matching the, [hollow], original varnish color and now I'm running from people who might, [terrified], kill me for restoring an old woman's violin, for doing my, [despairing], job.
80. Well, um, I know.
Character 1: Well, um, I never thought I'd see the, [bitter], mighty Officer Chen sitting on the sidewalk with a, [disbelieving], cardboard sign begging for spare change, I mean, especially not outside my restaurant.
81. Six months ago you were selling tacos from that, [hollow], illegal cart and now you own this place?
Character 1: [cynical] Um, well, yeah.
82. [defensive] Look, uh, I was just doing my, [exhausted], job back then when I shut you down, you know, following orders from the health department about, [resigned], unlicensed vendors even though your food was, [quiet], cleaner than most restaurants.
Character 1: [questioning] So, umm, what happened to you anyway, I mean, how does an enforcer end up, [stunned], homeless? [pause]
83. [measured] Turns out reporting corruption in the department makes you, [sardonic], unemployable anywhere that matters. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: The same corruption that had you shutting down, [angry], immigrant food carts while letting corporate chains operate without permits?
84. [haunted] Every cart I shut down was someone's, [guilty], dream being crushed and I did it fifty-seven, [breaking], times before I finally couldn't, [choked up], stomach it anymore. [long pause]
Character 1: [cold] Well, um, you cost me everything I had saved for, [trembling], ten years so, I mean, forgive me if I don't, [harsh], shed tears for your conscience finally showing up.
85. [desperate] Um, I know, er, okay?
Character 1: You stood there watching while they threw my grandmother's, [pained], recipes in the dumpster along with all my equipment. [sighs heavily]
86. Those recipes are what made this, [looking around], place successful though, right, because I can smell the same, [nostalgic], spices from that day and it's been, [regretful], haunting me ever since.
Character 1: [conflicted] Look, umm, I should hate you and, well, part of me still, [struggling], does but seeing you like this doesn't, [uncomfortable], feel as good as I thought it would, you know? [trailing off]
87. [weary] I mean, karma has a way of, uhh, serving justice better than any, [philosophical], court system ever could, right?
Character 1: [reluctant] There's a dishwashing position that just, [cautious], opened up in the kitchen if you're willing to work for someone whose, [pointed], life you tried to destroy.
88. [shocked] After everything I did to you, after the, [disbelieving], raids and the fines and the humiliation, you'd actually, [emotional], offer me work?
Character 1: [firm] The old me would have walked, [thoughtful], past you just like you walked past my tears that day but success taught me, [wise], something about second chances.
89. [grateful] Maybe redemption starts with scrubbing the, [hopeful], pots that cook the food I once tried to ban. [voice breaking]
Character 1: [decisive] Be here at five AM tomorrow and don't make me, [warning], regret this because I'm already questioning my, [uncertain], sanity for even suggesting it. [exhales]
90. Five AM with clean clothes and whatever's left of my, [determined], dignity ready to wash dishes for the American dream I once, [ironic], tried to crush. [chuckles darkly]
Customer: Um, hi, I'm—I'm calling about a, uh, credit card dispute? My client filed—wait, sorry, against me.
91. Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear you're dealing with that, let me just, uh, pull up your merchant account here... okay so I need your merchant ID number, it should start with MID-
Customer: Right, it's uh... MID... hang on, I wrote it—no that's the other—MID-4782-PK.
92. Perfect, thank you, so I'm seeing here MID-4782-PK and, um, I'm really sorry but there is indeed a dispute filed on October 23rd for $3,200, dispute case number DSP-8847-WQ92, and uh, it looks like the cardholder is claiming services not rendered?
Customer: But I—I cooked for them! Three days, their whole dinner party...
93. No no, I absolutely believe you, I'm so sorry this is happening, um, these wealthy clients can be... well, anyway, so the good news is you have 10 days from notification to submit your rebuttal documentation through our portal at disputes.merchantportal.com/case/DSP-8847-WQ92
Customer: Ten days? Um, that's... will they freeze my money until then or...?
94. So unfortunately—and I'm, uh, really sorry about this—the $3,200 has already been temporarily withdrawn from your account pending resolution, your available balance should show that hold under reference HLD-9923-TK
Customer: Oh god. Okay. Um. Breathe. What—what proof do you need exactly?
95. Right, so, um, here's what usually works best—and I've seen a lot of these resolve favorably—you'll want your signed contract, any emails or texts about the event, photos from the dinner if you have them, and definitely include your invoice INV-whatever number you used
Customer: I take photos of everything! Um, for my portfolio, so that's... that's good right?
96. Oh that's perfect actually, yeah, judges love photos with timestamps, and um, since you're in our system as a verified merchant since 2019, account creation date shows March 2019, MID-4782-PK, that credibility definitely helps your case
Customer: You're sure? Because this could really—I mean, my rent and...
97. I'm so, uh, I'm really sorry you're going through this stress, and I can't make promises but honestly? In my experience, when chefs have photos and contracts, it's like an 85% win rate, just make sure everything gets uploaded to case DSP-8847-WQ92 before November 2nd
Customer: Um, okay so, uh, stupid question but... they can't like, leave bad reviews while this is happening...?
98. So that's, um, actually completely separate from the dispute process, but uh, I mean between you and me? Screenshot everything now, because if they're the type to file a false dispute...
Customer: Right. Yeah. They, uh, they kept calling my salmon "pedestrian" but ate three servings so...
99. Ugh, I'm sorry but that made me laugh a little, um, okay so look, make sure in your rebuttal you mention exactly what was served, quantities, any special requests they made, reference your original invoice number in the documentation, and our review team at case.review@disputecenter, they really do read everything
Customer: This is actually helping. Um. Sorry for the—you know, the panic and...
100. Oh please, don't even apologize, this is literally what I'm here for, and um, honestly you're handling this way better than most people would, just remember upload everything to DSP-8847-WQ92, the portal accepts files up to 10MB each, and uh, if you need anything else my agent ID is SUP-7739-M, genuinely rooting for you here.
Customer: I need a transcript. From last Tuesday.
101. Oh! Um, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here and... hmm, okay so I'm seeing... yep, there we are. Can I get your, um, account number or phone number to verify?
Customer: Five five five. Eight seven two. Nine four one six.
102. Perfect, thank you so much! Okay so, um, I've got your account here and, uh, let me see... I'm showing a call on Tuesday at, hmm, looks like 2:47 PM, reference number REF-92847-TL, is that the one you're looking for?
Customer: That's that's the one. Yes.
103. Wonderful! So, um, here's the thing - I can absolutely get that transcript for you, like, no problem at all. Usually we send these to email within, uh, about 24 hours, but hmm, let me see if I can... actually, you know what? I might be able to expedite this for you...
Customer: I need it. Now. If possible.
104. Oh, um, I totally understand, let me, uh, let me work some magic here. So the transcript request ID is, um, TRQ-58219-KC and I'm just... hmm, checking our expedited options... okay so...
Customer: Um, look, I'm sorry, I just—I just really need this today.
105. No no, please don't apologize! I can hear this is, um, really important to you and, uh, honestly? I'm gonna do everything I can here. Let me just... okay so if I mark this as priority with code PRI-77463-M, that should... yep! I can get this to you within the hour.
Customer: Within the hour? Really?
106. Absolutely! I mean, um, technically we're supposed to wait for manager approval on rush transcripts but, uh, between you and me? Your Tuesday call was with, hmm, let me see... agent Maria, and she left really detailed notes in ticket TKT-30298-VP so I can just...
Customer: I sort of remember her saying something. About my warranty.
107. Oh yes! Um, so I'm actually looking at Maria's notes right here and, uh, she documented everything really thoroughly. The warranty discussion is, hmm, right here in section three of the call log, reference WRN-66012-QD, and that'll all be in your transcript.
Customer: Okay okay. Um, thank you. I probably overreacted.
108. Oh my goodness, no! Like, you're being so patient and, um, I completely get why you need this quickly. Uh, actually, you know what? While I'm processing this with rush code RSH-44819-BX, I can also, hmm, I can also send you the warranty details separately if that would help?
Customer: That's... yes. Please.
109. Perfect! So, um, I'm sending both documents to your email on file, and uh, the transcript confirmation is CNF-90156-JK, and then the warranty summary is, hmm, let me just... WSM-28374-NP. You should see both within, uh, actually probably more like 30 minutes now!
Customer: I'm sorry I was... terse. Earlier.
110. Oh please, honestly, you've been wonderful! Um, I just wish I could've gotten this to you even faster, but uh, with our system limitations... anyway! Both documents are processing now under batch number BCH-51692-TG and you'll get an email the second they're ready. Is there, um, anything else I can help with while we have you?
Customer: Um, hi, I'm, uh, calling for my dad? He's—sorry, I mean, he asked me to call about his account?
111. Oh absolutely, I'm happy to help you with that! So let me just—actually, first I'll need to verify the account, so do you have the account number handy? It should start with ACC and then some numbers.
Customer: Oh, um, yeah, I think it's... ACC-4829-JK? Or wait, maybe that's a six, not a nine?
112. Okay so—let me just—actually ACC-4826-JK, is that maybe what you're seeing? Sometimes the sixes and nines can look really similar on our statements, and I'm showing an account here with that number.
Customer: Yes! Sorry, um, that's probably it. I've never done this before.
113. No no, you're doing great, really! So, um, now I just need to verify—oh wait, actually let me just—since you're calling on behalf of your dad, is he there with you by any chance? Just so I can, you know, get his verbal permission to discuss the account.
Customer: Um, he's like, sort of here? He's driving, so, uh, can I just put him on speaker real quick?
114. Perfect, yeah, that works great!
Customer: Dad says it's fine, he says, um, to tell you the security code is, uh, Blue42?
115. Okay so, um, Blue42, let me just—actually that's—hmm, I'm showing here that the passcode for account ACC-4826-JK should be, uh, six characters, so maybe there's like another part to it? Sometimes people forget they added numbers at the end.
Customer: Oh! Um, maybe Blue42Star? I think? He's nodding, so, yeah, probably that one.
116. Blue42Star, perfect! Alright so, um, that went through and, uh, now I can help you with whatever you need on the account, so what can I do for you today?
Customer: So, um, there's like this charge? It's for $487 and, uh, we don't—I mean, he doesn't know what it's for?
117. Alright, let me pull that up here and—okay so I'm seeing a charge for $487 posted on the 15th with reference number REF-90284-TXN, and, um, it looks like that's from StreamPlus Entertainment, does that sound familiar at all?
Customer: Um, no? I mean, maybe? Actually wait, do you know if that's like a streaming service or something?
118. So yeah, StreamPlus is—let me just check here—it's actually, um, it's a streaming bundle service that includes like twelve different platforms, and according to transaction ID TXN-90284-B, this would be for an annual subscription that renewed on the 15th.
Customer: Oh god, um, that's probably mine then. I think I signed up for a trial last year? Sorry, this is, uh, embarrassing.
119. Oh no no, don't even worry about it, this happens all the time! So, um, since you're within thirty days of the charge with confirmation CFC-2847-Annual, I can actually—well, let me see what options we have—I can submit a refund request for you if you'd like to cancel it?
Customer: Really? Um, yes please! My dad's gonna kill me if—I mean, sorry, yes, that would be really great, thank you.
120. Absolutely, so I'm going ahead and, um, processing that cancellation now with case number CSE-48920-RF, and you should see the refund in about 3-5 business days, and, uh, I'll also send a confirmation email to the address on file just so you have everything documented, okay?
Customer: Um, hi, I just, uh, signed up for your loyalty thing and, er, I'm trying to understand the terms?
121. Oh yeah, the—let me just—okay so the VIP Rewards program, member ID VRP-8847-QN, and honestly? The terms are a bit—I mean, they're ridiculous, even I think so.
Customer: Right, um, so like, what happens with my points if I, uh, don't use them?
122. So they expire—wait no, sorry—they used to expire after 6 months but now it's—let me check—code POL-2024-EXP shows 12 months, which is still kinda short if you ask me.
Customer: Um, okay, that's, er, better than I thought, but uh, what about returns?
123. Yeah so, um, this is where it gets—I mean, honestly annoying—if you return something, um, the points get deducted from account PTS-BALANCE-01, and uh, if you already used them? They charge you.
Customer: They charge me? Um, that seems, uh, I mean next time I'll just, er, not bother with points then.
124. Right? It's—look, between us—total nonsense. The system ref TRM-SECTION-7B makes it so complicated when it should just be simple.
Customer: Well, um, at least you're being honest about it, uh, I appreciate that.
125. So here's what I—actually wait—let me tell you the workaround, um, if you use code SAVE-POINTS-90 when redeeming, uh, it protects them for returns, but they don't advertise this.
Customer: Um, really? That's, uh, actually helpful, er, thanks for telling me.
126. Yeah the whole—I mean—document DOC-LOYALTY-2024 is 47 pages long, who reads that? So um, anything else that's, uh, confusing you about it?
Customer: Er, what about, um, the birthday rewards thing, uh, how does that work exactly?
127. Oh that's actually—wait, let me—yeah so code BDAY-BONUS-200 gives double points, but here's the dumb part, you gotta activate it yourself, it's not automatic.
Customer: Um, of course it's not automatic, uh, why would anything just, er, work simply?
128. I know—it's like—we have your birthdate in file DOB-FIELD-ACTIVE, the system knows, but no, you still gotta manually click the button, it's so backwards.
Customer: Well, um, at least now I know, uh, better than finding out after missing it.
129. Exactly, and um, while we're at it—the tier system? Code TIER-SILVER-500, uh, you need 500 points for Silver but they don't—I mean, the benefits are barely different from basic.
Customer: Um, good to know, er, I'll just, uh, not stress about reaching tiers then.
130. Smart move, honestly just, um, use the points for discounts—code DISC-APPLY-10—and uh, don't overthink the rest, that's what I tell everyone who actually listens.
Customer: So. Got my bill. Thirty-seven dollars in... mystery fees.
131. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and I'll, um... what's the... I need your account number real quick if you have it?
Customer: Yeah. It's, um... 4-4-2... 8-1-9.
132. Perfect, got it, so that's account ACC-442819 and I can see—oh wow, yeah there's, um, there's definitely some charges here that are, uh, not typical.
Customer: Course there are. Can you just... line by line.
133. Right, yes, so um, starting from the top here, there's a, uh, what they call a "service assessment fee" for $12.50 under code FEE-8829A, which is, um, honestly I have no idea what that even...
Customer: Service assessment. For what service exactly...
134. Yeah, I know, it's—let me dig into this, um, so it looks like it's, uh, tied to your October statement, reference REF-10247B, and it's supposedly for, um, "account maintenance" which is just...
Customer: Account maintenance. Right. What's, um, what's the next one.
135. So the next one is, uh, even better—$15.00 for something called a, um, "regulatory compliance adjustment" with transaction TXN-559823C, which I think is just their way of, uh, you know...
Customer: Their way of taking fifteen bucks. Yeah.
136. Pretty much. Um, and then there's this, uh, $9.50 charge here labeled as, hmm, what's the word they're using... "network optimization fee" under code NET-7734X.
Customer: Network optimization. I'm an electrician. I don't... optimize networks.
137. No, I know, it's, um, it's ridiculous honestly. These are all just, uh, these automatic fees that the system, um, adds and half the time we can't even, uh, properly explain them because they're so...
Customer: Look, I know this isn't your fault. System's just...
138. I appreciate that, I really do, and um, you know what? Let me, uh, let me see what I can actually do here because these fees under codes FEE-8829A, TXN-559823C, and NET-7734X are, um, technically discretionary.
Customer: Discretionary. Meaning you can just, um... remove them?
139. Yeah so, um, I'm putting in a, uh, a credit request right now, reference number CRD-994521M, and honestly between you and me? These fees are, um, they're garbage and we both know it.
Customer: Yeah. They really are. So all thirty-seven gets...
140. All $37.00 credited back, um, should show up within, uh, two to three days under confirmation CON-8847P, and I've also, um, added a note to exempt your account from these, uh, "optimization" fees going forward.
Customer: I need—wait no. Um. The bill. Wrong. I think. Maybe wrong.
141. Okay, um, I can definitely help you with that. So, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, can you maybe give me your account number? It should be, um, right at the top of your bill, starts with ACC.
Customer: ACC. Um. Nine. Four. Uh—sorry, I mean—nine zero four. Seven seven. Two.
142. Perfect. Got it. ACC-904772. So, um, I'm looking at your account now and, uh, I can see your latest bill here. Can you maybe tell me what, um, what part looks wrong to you?
Customer: The... how do I—um. Extra money? I pay. Same always. Now is, uh, more.
143. Oh, okay okay. So, um, you're saying the amount is, uh, higher than usual? I think I see what you mean. So your regular monthly charge is, um, usually $89.99, but this month it's showing, uh, $127.43. Is that what you're, um, asking about?
Customer: Yes. Exactly yes. Why this. I don't—I mean, um, I didn't change. Nothing.
144. Right right. So, um, let me just. Check here. And, uh, actually I can see there's, hmm, there's an overage charge. From, um, data usage? On October 15th, there's a charge code OVR-8823-DT for, uh, $37.44.
Customer: Data? But I—no wait. Sorry. I don't, um, understand this word. Over?
145. Oh sure sure. Um, so basically, overage means, uh, you went over your limit? Like, um, you have a certain amount you can use each month. And if you use more than that. You know. They charge extra.
Customer: But I. Same things. Always same. Check email. That's—um, that's all.
146. Hmm, okay so, um, I'm looking at your usage details here and, uh, on October 15th there was, like, a really big spike? Um, almost 3GB in one day. Transaction log shows TXN-994837-MB. Do you maybe remember, um, downloading anything big that day? Or, uh, watching videos maybe?
Customer: October fifteen. Um. Wait I—my son. Visited. He use—he used? Probably. The phone.
147. Ah, okay okay. That makes sense. Kids and phones. Right? So, um, what I can do is, uh, I can maybe add a note to your account? Reference number REF-7749-CS. And, um, since this was kind of a one-time thing. I think. I might be able to get you, uh, a courtesy credit?
Customer: Please. Yes. I—I need this. Um. Fixed. Money is. Tight? Is that—correct word?
148. Absolutely. I totally understand. Money being tight. I mean. We all feel that. Right? So, um, let me just submit this request here and, uh, I'll need approval code but, hmm, usually these get approved pretty quick.
Customer: How long? Sorry I—um, when I see. The money. Back?
149. So, um, once it's approved—and I'm putting rush code RSH-662 on it—you'll see the credit in, uh, probably about 3 to 5 business days? It'll show up as, um, adjustment ADJ-8827-OCT on your next statement.
Customer: Thank you. Really. I was—um, so worry. Worried? Thank you. Much.
150. Oh, you're so welcome! And, um, hey, your English is great by the way. I know it's, uh, it's hard explaining technical stuff in another language. If you ever need help again, just, um, reference this case number CSE-10847-B and we'll, you know, have all this history. Take care!
Customer: So I guess, um, my rate just... went up? Sort of noticed it on my bill.
151. Oh. Um. Let me just... I'm gonna pull up your account right away and... hmm... okay I see account number ACT-7749-NL here and, uh, I'm going to... let me check what happened...
Customer: Probably some kind of, uh... what's the word... automatic thing, right?
152. So, um, looking at this... and I want to make sure we... uh... your previous rate of forty-nine ninety-nine expired on... hmm... October first and... I'm seeing it jumped to seventy-four ninety-nine which is... that's not...
Customer: Of course it did. I mean, uh, why would anyone actually... tell me.
153. No no, this isn't... um, I'm going to fix this. Really. So what happened is, uh, promotion code PROMO-8821-X expired and the system just... but I'm not letting this...
Customer: Yeah. Um. Just... I think I'm kind of over it.
154. Wait. Don't be. Um. I'm putting in... uh... override request ORR-5543-KP92 right now to... hmm... I want to protect you from this happening again so...
Customer: Sure. Whatever. Probably won't, um... won't stick anyway.
155. No, listen, I'm... uh... I'm actually going to... um... set up notification code NTF-2010-B on your account so next time any rate changes you'll get... ummm... three different alerts and I'm also...
Customer: Uh, three alerts for the... for the thing I won't, um, read anyway?
156. I know you're... look, I get it. But um, I'm also applying credit... er... reference number CRD-9984-TK22 for the difference. Two hundred twenty-five dollars. Going back three months because they should've...
Customer: Wait. Um. You're actually... that's sort of... real money?
157. Very real. Already... um... processed. Confirmation CTX-4419-ML. And I'm... uh... I'm also locking in rate code RATE-3387-LOCK for twenty-four months at... hmm... thirty-nine ninety-nine which is even lower...
Customer: That's, uh... I mean that's kind of... why would you do that?
158. Because this shouldn't... um... I mean, you shouldn't have to... uh... call us angry every year just to get... it's not...
Customer: I'm not even angry. Just, um... tired. Really tired.
159. Yeah. I... ummm... I hear that a lot and it's... So I've put permanent note PRM-NOTE-8847 that says... er... any future increases need manager approval first. And honestly I'm just... I'm tired of seeing this happen too...
Customer: Huh. Maybe, um... maybe this actually... I think it might work out.
160. It will. I promise. Reference number for everything today is, um, CALL-7263-PPK01 and I'm... I'm making sure you don't... uh... don't have to do this again.
Customer: Um, hi, so I got my bill and it's—wait no, the charges are just, er, I can't figure out what's what?
161. Oh hey there! So, um, I totally get that. Actually—you know what? I was just. Looking at my own. Phone bill yesterday. And I had the, uh, same exact reaction. Let me just, er, pull up your account here and we can, um, go through it line by line together.
Customer: Oh good, um, yeah that'd help, er, thanks.
162. Alright so. I've got your account. Number ACT-7739-QM42. Right here. And, um, I'm seeing your total is—hmm, let me just... what's the word I'm looking for... your statement total. Is showing $127.84. Does that, uh, match what you're seeing?
Customer: Um yeah that's right but like there's all these, uh, fees and I don't—sorry, I mean the service charges or...
163. No no, totally fair question! So, um, honestly? When I started here. I spent like. Three days. Just trying to understand our own billing codes. It's, uh, it's kind of ridiculous how they label everything. Your base plan BPL-9983-Z is, er, that's your $59.99, and then...
Customer: Uh-huh and then there's um this data thing that's—wait no that's twenty—er, twenty-eight something?
164. Yeah exactly. So that's, um, that's showing as. Hmm. Code DOV-4428-K. Which is, uh, basically your... what's the term... your overage charge. For data. Looks like you went, er, about 3 gigs over your limit last month?
Customer: Oh. Um. Yeah I was, uh, traveling and forgot to—you know...
165. Oh man, um, I did the exact same thing! Last month in Denver. Just, uh, streaming and streaming. Without even thinking. Let me, er, let me see if there's something I can... hmm... looking for a... courtesy credit maybe?
Customer: Really? Um that's—I mean if you could but I know it's not your fault the system's so...
166. No you're sweet for saying that. But honestly. This happens. All the time. So, um, I'm applying credit code CRD-8851-XP22 and that'll, uh, that'll knock off half that overage. Which brings it down to, er, fourteen dollars instead.
Customer: Um wow okay that's, er, that's really nice, uh, and then what's this regulatory fee thing?
167. Ugh. The regulatory fees. So those are, um, basically government... what's the word I want... mandated charges? We have to, uh, pass them through. Your specific ones are, er, let me see, REG-5574-A and REG-5575-B. That's $4.12 and $2.77.
Customer: Got it got it, um, and the equipment? That's, uh, fifteen? Sorry I'm throwing lots at you...
168. No no! This is. Literally. My job. And um, between you and me? I'd rather help someone who's, uh, actually trying to understand their bill. Than deal with. You know. The screamers. Your equipment charge EQP-0923-RF88. That's your router rental. Which, um, actually...
Customer: Er, what? Is something, um, wrong with it or...?
169. So, uh, no nothing's wrong! But. Here's the thing. You've been renting for, hmm, let me calculate... eighteen months? At fifteen a month. That's, er, that's $270 total. You could've bought one for like. Eighty bucks.
Customer: Oh. Um. Wow I didn't even—that's kind of, uh, I mean thanks for telling me that...
170. Look. I'm not, um, supposed to suggest this. But. If you buy your own. And return ours. With receipt number RET-3999-QZ. We can, uh, backdate the return. By one billing cycle. Save you another fifteen. I mean. If you want.
Customer: So um, this is. Like. Embarrassing. But I need a refund?
171. Oh, um, let me just pull that up for you, so basically I'll need to, uh, get your order number first if you have it? I mean, we can also search by email or, hmm, phone number if that's easier.
Customer: I run a ticket office. I do refunds. All day. Can't fix mine though.
172. [exhales] Oh wow, yeah that's, uh, that's actually kind of ironic isn't it? I mean, I totally get it though, like, our system is probably, um, completely different from yours. So what's the issue with the refund?
Customer: It's like... what's the word... stuck? Processing. For three weeks.
173. Three weeks? Okay so, um, that's definitely not normal, like at all. Let me, uh, let me look into this. Can you give me your confirmation number? Should be something like, hmm, REF and then some numbers?
Customer: REF-4429. No wait. Um. REF-4492? The second one.
174. Perfect, so REF-4492, and I'm, uh, pulling that up now... [inhales sharply] Oh. Yeah, I see what happened here. So basically your refund got, um, flagged in our fraud prevention system which is, like, honestly pretty ridiculous.
Customer: Fraud? For what? Returning concert tickets? That I bought. Legitimately?
175. Yeah no, I know, it's, um, it's honestly kind of embarrassing on our end? Like the system sometimes just, uh, randomly flags stuff when there's multiple tickets or, hmm, high value transactions, even though yours was only, let me see... TXN-73902-AK, that's $247.50.
Customer: So like. What now. Do I just. Wait? Another three weeks?
176. [exhales] Absolutely not, no. So, um, between you and me? This happens, like, way too often. I'm gonna, uh, manually override this right now, and basically push it through to, hmm, priority processing.
Customer: You can do that? Just. Override it. That simple?
177. I mean, yeah, I probably should've, um, checked with a supervisor first but, uh, honestly? You've waited long enough. Your new reference is gonna be, so, REF-4492-PRIORITY-X and that should, hmm, that should clear by tomorrow.
Customer: Tomorrow? Not like... another eternity? You're sure?
178. [soft exhale] Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm putting it through right now actually. Can you see your email? Because you should get, um, you should get confirmation in like, hmm, maybe two minutes? With tracking code TRK-95081-QM.
Customer: Oh my god. Um. Yeah. It just. It came through. Already?
179. Good, right? So that means it's, uh, it's definitely in the priority queue now. And, um, look, I know this whole thing has been, like, really frustrating, especially with your job and everything.
Customer: This is. Embarrassing but. Like. Thank you? So much. Seriously.
180. Hey, no problem at all, I mean, we all need help sometimes, right? Your refund reference REF-4492-PRIORITY-X should, um, should hit your account within 24 hours, but like, honestly? Usually it's faster, maybe, hmm, by tonight even.
Customer: Um, yeah, I'm calling about this... what's the word... this charge on my account that shouldn't be there?
181. Oh! Um, okay so let me just—actually wait—let me pull up your account first so I can, uh, double-check everything for you, can I get your account number or phone?
Customer: It's under 555-0842. They said it would be free...
182. Got it got it so that's—um, okay I'm seeing account ACT-7829-JK42 here and, uh, let me just make sure that's right—is this for the premium upgrade service that was, like, activated on the 15th?
Customer: That's what the last person said. Free trial, no charges.
183. Right right so, um, basically what I'm seeing here is like, there's a charge for $29.99 that went through on, uh, let me see... transaction TXN-904582773, and um, you're saying someone told you this would be free?
Customer: I mean, yeah, they were very... um, what's the right way to put it... they were clear about that part, or so I thought...
184. Okay okay let me just dig deeper here—I want to make absolutely sure I understand what happened—checking your call history now and I need to verify everything matches up with case number CSE-1847-BN91.
Customer: And then they just... I don't know, if that makes sense but...
185. So I'm—wait actually—no hang on—basically I found the original promotion code PRM-FREE30 that was supposed to be applied but, um, it looks like maybe it didn't—er, didn't process correctly when the agent set it up?
Customer: Um, how does that even... I mean, this is like the third time something like this has happened.
186. Oh no no I'm so sorry about that—let me absolutely fix this right now—I'm applying credit CRD-8829-XM44 for the full amount and also making sure the free trial code gets properly attached this time, is that okay?
Customer: I've been a customer for eight years. Eight years of this.
187. I know I know and, um, that's—so like, I can totally see your history here and, uh, you absolutely shouldn't have to deal with this—let me also add, um, a courtesy credit using code CMP-5030-RT for the inconvenience?
Customer: What's that supposed to... how much are we talking about?
188. Absolutely so, um, so that's gonna be an additional $15 credit and, uh, basically both credits will show up within, like, 24 to 48 hours under reference REF-209847-K, um, and I'm documenting everything right now.
Customer: That's what they said last time too. The credits would just appear...
189. Okay.
Customer: Will I get some kind of confirmation or...
190. Yes yes definitely so you'll get an email confirmation to the address on file with confirmation number CNF-8827-LP93 and, um, I'm also putting a note here that if there's any issue at all you can reference case CSE-1847-BN91 and any agent will see exactly what we discussed today—and again I'm really sorry about this whole mix-up.
Customer: So basically, um, I need to talk to like... what's the word... a supervisor or something?
191. Oh! Yes, absolutely I can—wait, let me just—hmm, okay so first I need to pull up your account. Um, can you give me your confirmation number? Should be like, uh, something starting with CNF?
Customer: It's um... wait, CNF-something? I have like, uh, 7824... no that's not right.
192. That's—no worries! Let me try—actually, hmm, what about your order number? Starts with ORD. Should be, um, on your email.
Customer: So basically the other person said ORD-9982 or, uh, was it 9892? Um, something like that.
193. Okay okay! So I've got—wait, let me—ORD-9982-BK47. Yes! Got it. Um, so I can see here that, uh, my colleague was working on your refund issue and, hmm, looks like they hit a snag with the system.
Customer: Right so like, um, they couldn't fix it and basically just... stopped helping?
194. Oh no no! That's not—sorry, I mean—um, they escalated to tier two support. Let me see here... Your ticket number is, uh, TKT-885241. So basically what happened is, um, the refund got stuck in our payment processor.
Customer: But I need someone who can actually, um, you know... fix this today?
195. Right right. Absolutely. So, um, here's what I can do—actually wait, hmm, let me check something first... Okay so your original transaction ID was TXN904428156 and, uh, that's showing as pending reversal since, um, Tuesday.
Customer: Tuesday? So wait, um, they told me Monday... or was it, uh, Wednesday?
196. Actually it was—no wait, sorry—initiated Monday. Stuck Tuesday. Um, so basically the system flagged it for manual review because, uh, the amount exceeded our automatic threshold.
Customer: I don't... what's that mean exactly? Like, um, why does the amount matter?
197. Oh! Right, so—hmm, basically anything over, um, let me check... over $500 needs supervisor approval. Your refund of, uh, $687.42 on reference number REF-30298-AA needs a supervisor code.
Customer: So that's why I need to, um, talk to someone higher up basically?
198. Exactly! Yes. So, um, let me get you to—actually, hmm, my supervisor is in a meeting but, uh, I can see if... wait, let me check the schedule.
Customer: Um, how long would that be? Like... what's the wait time or whatever?
199. Okay so—hmm, looks like about, um, fifteen to twenty minutes? But wait—actually, uh, I might be able to... Let me try putting through override code OVR-7726. Sometimes that, um, that works.
Customer: So basically you're saying, uh, maybe you can fix it without... without the supervisor?
200. Well—I mean, um, I'm trying but—oh! Actually it went through! Your refund confirmation is, uh, RFN-445892-XK and should process in, hmm, 3-5 business days. No supervisor needed!
Customer: So like, um, how do I know you're... you're actually, uh, qualified to tell me about... about tax stuff?
201. Oh absolutely, um, I totally understand your concern, so I'm, uh, I'm actually a licensed tax specialist here with certification number TAX-8847-NM, and um, we deal with side gig income questions like, you know, all the time, especially for wedding officiants.
Customer: Wait wait wait, you... you deal with wedding officiants? Specifically?
202. Yes, definitely! I'm going to make sure we get this sorted out properly for you, and actually your case reference number is REF-2024-31558, which I'll note here specifically mentions wedding officiant services as your income source.
Customer: But like, um, how do I... what's the word... um, verify that you're not just, uh, trying to sell me something?
203. So, um, I think—no wait, let me be really clear here—we're, uh, we're actually the IRS helpline, so like, we don't sell anything, and um, your call tracking number is CALL-90214-TX if you need to, you know, reference this conversation later.
Customer: Okay okay, so basically, um, I just... I just started doing this and, uh, my sister said I might owe like... like thousands?
204. Oh no, I'm going to make sure you understand exactly what you'll owe—so for your income bracket, which I'm seeing here as profile ID INC-45K-78B, wedding officiant income under $600 per event typically falls under Form 1099-NEC guidelines, not the scary numbers your sister might be thinking of.
Customer: It's it's, um, more than that though, like I did... so basically I did three weddings last month and, uh...
205. Mm-hmm, um, okay so, uh, let me just—actually, hmm, three weddings could mean, um, different things tax-wise, so I'm pulling up calculator tool CAL-2024-SCHED-C here, and uh, basically we need to figure out your total income first.
Customer: Each one was... was twelve hundred dollars. My mom's sick and I need this money.
206. Oh sweetie, I understand completely—I'm going to make absolutely sure you keep as much of that money as legally possible, so with $3,600 monthly income logged under transaction code TRN-3600-WO, we're looking at quarterly estimated taxes, but there are deductions we can definitely explore.
Customer: But but how do I know... what if I mess it up? What if they come after me?
207. I think—well actually, you know what? I sort of understand that fear because honestly, yeah, the IRS messaging can be really intimidating, but here's what I'm doing—I'm flagging your account ACC-89921-WED for our new filer protection program.
Customer: New filer... protection? Is that... that's real?
208. It's absolutely real, and between you and me? It's probably the best thing they've introduced—your protection code is NFP-2024-7812, and basically it means if you make honest mistakes in your first year, they work with you instead of penalizing you right away.
Customer: So so like, um, the money for my mom's... her treatments, they won't... won't take all of it?
209. No no no, um, listen, so probably—I mean, uh, with proper quarterly payments using voucher series QV-2024-A through D, you're looking at maybe, um, keeping about 75-80% of your gross income, and uh, that's before we even talk about business expense deductions.
Customer: I'm just... I'm scared I'm doing this wrong. I bought a printer for certificates.
210. Oh that printer is definitely deductible! I'm going to make sure you claim that under expense code EXP-OFFICE-001, and honestly? You're doing everything right by calling us—most people don't even think about taxes until April, so you're already ahead of the game here.
Customer: Um, hi. I'm calling about. Uh. My claim? For my dog. Got denied.
211. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, um, let me just pull that up for you and, uh, see what happened here. So basically I'll need your policy number, which should start with PET and then like eight digits?
Customer: PET-44829106. I'm. I'm actually a vet tech? So I kind of. Know. This wasn't pre-existing.
212. Okay so I've got your policy here, PET-44829106, and I can see the claim that was submitted on the 15th for... oh, this is for hip dysplasia treatment, and they marked it as pre-existing condition, but you're saying—and I completely understand your frustration here—you're saying it definitely wasn't?
Customer: No. No way. Are you sure that's. That's why? I mean. Hip dysplasia?
213. Um, yeah, so like, according to the notes here in claim CLM-7792-XP, they're saying there was, uh, some indication in the initial vet records from, hmm, let me see... from January that suggested possible hip issues?
Customer: That was. A sprain. Just a sprain. Of course they'd. Do this.
214. No, you know what? This doesn't sound right at all. So basically, um, I'm looking at the actual medical coding here, code MED-5598-V12, and like, a sprain is completely different from dysplasia. I think someone really messed up here.
Customer: So um, can you maybe, uh, fix it? Or. I don't know. What happens now?
215. Listen, I'm going to, uh, personally escalate this right now. This is ridiculous. You work in veterinary medicine, you know the difference, and honestly? So should our review team. Let me create an urgent appeal, reference number APL-8827-QM91.
Customer: Will that. Actually work though? I kind of. Feel like. They already decided.
216. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and like, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but, uh, I'm flagging this for our medical director's direct review, not just the regular appeals team, because, um, this is clearly an error and you shouldn't have to wait weeks for this.
Customer: Really? You can. Do that? Are you sure?
217. Absolutely. I've added priority flag PRY-6621 to your case. And between you and me? Our medical director used to be a practicing vet. She'll take one look at this and know immediately that someone confused a soft tissue injury with a skeletal condition.
Customer: Um, okay so, uh, how long? I mean. I sort of. Already paid. Out of pocket.
218. So typically it's 5-7 business days, but with the priority flag? You should hear back within 48-72 hours. And, um, once it's approved—which I really think it will be—the reimbursement reference RMB-55498-TK will trigger automatically, so like, you'll get your money back pretty quickly.
Customer: I just. Can't believe. This happened. We cover. Everything. For our clinic patients.
219. I know, and that's, uh, that's what makes this so frustrating, right? Like you're literally helping animals every day, you know exactly what you're looking at medically, and then, um, someone without that expertise just... denies your claim based on a misread.
Customer: Yeah. Exactly. Thanks for. Um. Actually listening. I guess.
220. Of course, and um, I'm putting my direct extension in the case notes—it's EXT-4429—so like, if you need anything or don't hear back in those 72 hours, just, uh, call and ask for me directly. We're absolutely going to get this fixed for you and your dog.
Customer: Um, hi. So like. I need to—I need to dispute something? It's it's on my card.
221. Oh, um, absolutely, I can—so basically I'm here to help with that, uh, let me just pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted, okay?
Customer: Okay okay. Um. This is—I've never done this? Before? So like...
222. No no, hey, um, I totally get it—disputing charges is, uh, it's stressful, like especially the first time, so basically don't worry, we'll walk through this step by step together, alright?
Customer: It's it's for gym equipment. Two hundred dollars. But I never—I never got anything.
223. Oh wow, um, two hundred for equipment you didn't receive? That's—uh, that's really frustrating, so let me just, hmm, get your case number started here... okay so that's gonna be DSP-4429-BK71.
Customer: Wait. Do I—will this mess up my credit? Or or my account?
224. Um, no no no, so like, disputing won't hurt your credit at all, uh, and actually while we investigate—so that's usually about, um, five to seven days—we'll issue a temporary credit to your account with code TMP-8837-XC.
Customer: Five days? But but rent is—um, it's due Monday.
225. Oh, uh, oh gosh, okay so—let me just—actually you know what? I'm gonna, um, expedite this for you because rent, that's—that's critical, so basically I'm marking this as priority with reference PRY-2201-MK.
Customer: You can? Really? Like for real?
226. Yeah! Absolutely, so um, between you and me? When it's, uh, when it's affecting housing or food? We bump it up. Your expedited claim EXP-7734-QR should process by, hmm, Saturday latest.
Customer: Okay. Okay okay. So so what—what happens now?
227. Right, so, um, next steps—uh, basically I need to ask you, like, three quick questions about the charge, and then, er, we're pretty much done here, sound good?
Customer: Um. Yeah. Yes. Go—go ahead.
228. Perfect, so, uh, first—did you authorize any purchase from, hmm, let me see here... "FitGear Premium LLC" on October 3rd? Transaction ID is TXN-9948-KL22.
Customer: No! No no no. Never heard of—I don't even. No.
229. Got it, um, totally clear—and, uh, just to confirm, you haven't received any packages or, like, any shipping notifications from them, right?
Customer: Nothing. I just—I just saw it. On my statement. Today.
230. Okay so, um, that's all I needed, uh, your dispute DSP-4429-BK71 is officially filed and, er, you should see that temporary credit within, like, twenty-four hours max—and hey, you did great for your first dispute!
Customer: Um, hi, I'm—I'm calling about, uh, taxes? It's it's kind of complicated and I'm—I'm not sure if you can even help me.
231. So, um, I can definitely help you with tax-related questions. Let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—actually, wait, let me get you to the right system. Can you give me like your account number or, um, the reference number from any previous correspondence?
Customer: Oh god, I don't—I don't have an account, this is about my my employer's taxes, well, my taxes, but they they messed something up?
232. Okay okay, so basically, um, you're calling about a payroll tax issue, and like, even without an account I can, uh, I can still help you out here. Let me just create a case number for you—that's going to be CSE-447291-TX so we can track this conversation. So what exactly happened with the withholding?
Customer: Right right, so I'm a nanny, and um, they've been taking out taxes but but I just found out it's it's all wrong, like completely wrong amounts!
233. Got it, got it.
Customer: And I'm—I'm freaking out because, uh, tax season is coming and I don't know, I mean, what if I owe thousands? I can't—I can't afford that!
234. So, um, let me just—okay, so basically what happens with household employees is, uh, there's specific forms that need to be filed, and like, the withholding calculations can get, um, pretty complex. Your case number CSE-447291-TX, I'm noting here that you're dealing with incorrect withholding amounts. When did you, uh, when did you first notice the error?
Customer: Um, last week when I was—I was looking at my paystub and the numbers just just didn't match what we agreed on initially.
235. Okay so, um, this is actually—and I see this a lot—this is pretty common with household employment situations. So basically the good news is, uh, we can definitely fix this going forward, and like, for the past withholdings, there's form 941-X that can be filed for corrections. Let me, um, let me pull up the reference guide here—document ID DOC-8892-W2H.
Customer: Wait wait wait, can my—can my employer get in trouble? Because they're they're really good people and I don't want to cause problems!
236. Right right, so, um, I understand your concern and, uh, basically as long as they file the corrections promptly there shouldn't be any penalties. The IRS is actually pretty, uh, pretty understanding about honest mistakes, especially when you're—I mean, when they're proactively fixing them.
Customer: Oh thank god, because um, I love this family, I mean I I watch their kids, their baby has special needs and and I can't lose this job!
237. Absolutely.
Customer: And the mom, she's she's already so stressed, her her mother is sick and now this tax thing, I just—I just feel terrible bringing it up.
238. So, um, here's what I'd suggest, and, uh, I've seen this work really well in similar situations. First, like, you'll want to get form W-4 updated—that's the basic withholding form—and, um, your employer needs to adjust their quarterly filings. I'm sending you, uh, well actually, do you want me to email you the instruction packet? It's reference PKT-2847-NNY for nanny tax corrections.
Customer: Yes yes please! Um, but like, can you—can you explain it in in simple terms? Because I'm not—I'm not good with tax stuff at all.
239. Of course, so basically, um, think of it like this—they've been taking out, let's say, the wrong percentage from your paycheck, right? So, uh, what needs to happen is they file an amended return for each quarter where it was wrong—that's the 941-X I mentioned—and then, um, going forward they just use the correct percentages. The packet PKT-2847-NNY has like, uh, step-by-step instructions with examples, so, I mean, it's actually pretty straightforward once you see it laid out.
Customer: Okay okay, um, that sounds—that sounds doable. I'm just just worried about what I might owe, you know? Like, uh, my car needs repairs and I I can't handle a big tax bill right now.
240. So, um, let me ease your mind a bit here because, uh, based on what you're describing, if they've been withholding incorrectly, you might actually be due a refund rather than—I mean, rather than owing. But like, even if you do end up owing, the IRS has payment plans and, uh, with your case number CSE-447291-TX documented here, you'd have proof that this was an employer error, not, um, not tax evasion or anything like that. So basically, you're doing exactly the right thing by addressing it now.
Customer: Okay so, um, I'm I'm calling about a charge that's—let me see here—from September?
241. Um, September. Okay. So let me, uh, pull up your account here. Can I get your, um, account number? Or actually—wait. Phone number's fine.
Customer: It's it's 555-0192. Look, I just need this fixed quickly.
242. Got it. Um, so I'm seeing account ACC-7739-BK21 here, and uh... yeah. September charges. Actually, er, funny thing—I had this exact same issue. On my personal account? Double charged for three months before I caught it.
Customer: Wait wait wait, you're saying this happens? Hmm, okay so that means... this isn't just me?
243. No no. Um, definitely not. So looking at transaction TXN-9982447-Q from September 15th, I can see, uh, there's a duplicate charge for $89.99. Same timestamp. Classic system glitch.
Customer: Eighty-nine ninety-nine, yes yes exactly! Um, so can you just—can you reverse it now?
244. Right. So. Here's where I, um, wish I had better news. Our system only lets me, uh, process refunds for 90 days back. September's outside that window. But—hang on. Let me check something.
Customer: Oh come on, I just—I just need my money back, that's that's all.
245. Totally get it. Um, believe me. When it happened to me? I was, uh, pretty frustrated too. Okay so, er, I'm escalating this to case number CSE-44821-RV. My supervisor can override the 90-day thing.
Customer: Hmm, what if they say no? I mean, um, this is your company's mistake.
246. Um, honestly? They won't. I've, uh, I've seen maybe two denials ever. For clear duplicates like this. Reference number REF-7763299-A is your proof. Should be, um, resolved in 3-5 business days.
Customer: Okay okay okay, so um, 3 to 5 days, and then it's—let me think—back on my card?
247. Exactly. Right back. Original payment method. Er, though sometimes banks take an extra day or two. Just so you know.
Customer: Great great, um, but next time—I mean, if this happens again...
248. Yeah no. Um, I hear you. So I'm also, uh, adding note DOC-5589-MK to your account about this. If it happens again? Any rep will see it. Instant approval. No questions.
Customer: That's that's actually helpful, um, thank you. Really. I was expecting more of a fight.
249. Nah. Um, look—between you and me? These billing errors are, uh, embarrassing for us. We know it. So case CSE-44821-RV will get priority treatment. I'm putting that in the notes too.
Customer: Okay so, hmm, I guess that's it then? You'll you'll email me updates?
250. Um, yep. Every step. You'll get confirmation for case CSE-44821-RV within, uh, an hour. Then another when it's approved. And, er, final one when the refund processes. All good?
Customer: Um, so like... my account just got... hmm, how do I even know this is really support?
251. Oh gosh, I completely understand your concern, and I'm so sorry you're dealing with an account deactivation—let me verify your identity first with your driver ID, which should start with DRV, and then we can absolutely get to the bottom of this together.
Customer: It's... what's the... DRV-4429-88. But this could be anyone...
252. So, um, thank you for that, and like, I totally get why you're suspicious because, uh, honestly? The system sometimes just... it does things without warning and, um, I can see here that your account DRV-4429-88 was, uh, deactivated at 3:47 AM this morning, which is just... that's awful timing.
Customer: Um, wait, 3:47? That's... hmm... I was literally, uh, delivering an order then, so...
253. Right right, exactly, and that's what makes this so frustrating—I can see transaction TXN-9982741-K showing an active delivery at that exact time, and honestly this happens more than it should where the automated system just flags things incorrectly.
Customer: So you're telling me this is just... what, a glitch or...
254. So basically, um, what I'm seeing here is, like, there's a flag on your account for, uh... let me see here... it says "unusual activity pattern" but, um, when I look at your actual records under case number CSE-7739-QM, everything looks, uh, completely normal to me.
Customer: Unusual activity? That's... um, what does that even... I mean, uh, how do I know you're not just making this up?
255. I hear you, I really do—let me share your last five order numbers so you know this is legitimate: ORD-8847-PA, ORD-8846-MN, ORD-8845-TK, ORD-8844-RR, and ORD-8843-VX, all completed successfully with five-star ratings.
Customer: Okay those... those are mine. But why would they just...
256. So, um, between you and me? The system sometimes, uh, it flags drivers who are actually doing really well because, um, like your completion rate is 98% under metric code MET-4429-A, and sometimes that, uh... ironically that triggers the fraud detection.
Customer: Wait so, um... hmm... you're saying I got deactivated for being, uh, too good at my job?
257. Essentially, yes, and I know how absolutely backwards that sounds—I've seen this happen with reference ticket REF-2234-PP where high-performing drivers get caught in these automated sweeps, and it breaks my heart every single time.
Customer: This is... I have rent due tomorrow...
258. Oh no, oh no, okay so, um, listen, I'm going to, uh, escalate this immediately under priority code PRI-9987-STAT, and, um, normally reactivation takes 48 hours but, uh, given your situation I'm gonna, hmm, let me try something here...
Customer: Um, try what exactly? Like, uh, how do I... what's the guarantee here that...
259. So, um, what I'm doing is, uh, I'm submitting an emergency override request, case EMR-5547-XX, and, um, I'm literally typing in the notes that, like, you have perfect ratings and, uh, rent due, and um, I'm copying my supervisor directly.
Customer: And this will actually work? Not just some runaround?
260. Absolutely, so, um, you'll get a reactivation email to your registered address within, uh, two hours max with confirmation code pending, and like, if you don't? Um, call back and ask for me directly—I'm agent 4472—and I'll, uh, personally make sure this gets fixed today.
Customer: Um, hi, I'm I'm calling about, uh, data privacy? Like what what information you actually, er, keep?
261. Oh hey there! Alright. So. Between you and me? Most companies won't tell you this stuff straight. Let me pull up your account real quick—got your number as ACC-7749-PZ here—and I'll walk you through exactly what we've got.
Customer: Oh wow, that's that's really... thank you so much for being upfront about—
262. No prob! So, um, here's the deal. We store. Obviously. Your basics. Name, address, phone, email under profile PFL-8827-QM. But then—and this is where it gets interesting—we've also got your purchase history, browsing patterns, and, uh, device IDs.
Customer: Device IDs? Um, like like my phone and... I mean, what else?
263. Yeeeah so, hmm, let me think how to explain this best... Basically any device that logs into your account gets tagged with identifier DVC-9943-KL through DVC-9945-KL for you. Phone. Tablet. Laptop. Even smart TVs if you use our app there.
Customer: That's actually, um, really helpful that you're you're telling me all this, I really appreciate—
264. Course! Look. I figure. You deserve to know, right? So there's also—and don't freak out—location data when you use the app, saved under LOC-4419-BN, but, um, you can totally turn that off in settings if you want.
Customer: Oh. Oh wow. That's... I just... there's so much data, I can't...
265. Mm-hmm.
Customer: Um, sorry, I'm just, it's it's overwhelming? But but thank you for for actually explaining—
266. Hey hey, totally get it. Let me see here... You know what? I'm gonna send you our data report—document DOC-7734-XP—it lists everything. Every. Single. Thing. Most people never ask for it but, uh, between us? Everyone should read it.
Customer: You'd you'd really do that? That's so... I mean, most places just just give me the runaround.
267. Right right.
Customer: Ummm, is there, like, anything else I should should, er, know about? Privacy-wise?
268. So, hmm, what if I told you... Okay. Technically not supposed to mention this. But. Your data package DPK-8891-QZ? It gets sold to partners unless you opt out. The opt-out form is buried—I'll email you the direct link.
Customer: Wait it gets—sorry, I mean—it gets sold? I just... I can't even...
269. Yeah. Yep. I know. Look, um, let me be real with you here—form number FRM-3347-LP is what you need, and, uh, I'm putting a note in your file right now that you're interested in maximum privacy settings, cool?
Customer: That's... you're being so so helpful, like, um, specifically taking the time to to explain all—thank you.
270. Absolutely! And um, one more thing? Check your email in about... five minutes. I'm sending you my personal guide—document GDE-9962-AA—on locking down your privacy. Don't. Share it around. But it's got all the tricks nobody tells you about.
Customer: Um, hi. Let me see here... Called last week? Order came. Actually worked.
271. Oh wow! That's. Actually wonderful. To hear. Um, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and... trailing off a bit... was it the ORD-7823-PL order you called about?
Customer: Yeah. That one. Hmm, what if... no, it's good. Just wanted to say. Thanks.
272. You know, um, I'm gonna be really honest here? Like, uh, these calls where everything actually worked out... they kind of, um, make my whole week. Seriously. We get so many frustrated people and then...
Customer: Right. Well. Next time though. Can't have delays. You understand? Important clients.
273. Absolutely. Completely. Get it. Um, actually I'm, uh, putting a note here in your file - PRF-9982-VIP - so like, um, next time any agent sees this they'll know to, uh, expedite everything immediately.
Customer: Okay so that means... priority? Every time? Let me see... hmm, good.
274. Yeah so, um, basically what happens is, uh, when you call in, that code PRF-9982-VIP lights up and, um, we automatically bump you to tier one handling, which means...
Customer: Do you know who... forget it. Just. Worked out. That's what matters.
275. I actually. Had a similar thing. Once. Um, so like, I ordered something critical for my daughter's recital and it was, uh, delayed and I just... I totally get how stressful that is when you're counting on something.
Customer: Um, yeah. Exactly. Hmm, what if it happens again though? Can't. Won't work.
276. So here's. What I'm doing. Your account now has escalation code ESC-4421-A attached. If anything. Ever. Goes sideways. You reference that and boom. Straight to management.
Customer: Good. That's... okay so that means I'm covered. Next time.
277. And um, just between us? Like, uh, I'm also adding my direct extension - 7739 - to your notes, so if you ever, um, need someone who actually understands the situation...
Customer: Let me see here... you're saying... hmm, direct line? That's. Unexpected. Good unexpected.
278. Yeah I mean. Look. Um, when someone actually takes time to call back and, uh, say thanks? That's so rare. Like literally. So rare. I want to make sure you're taken care of.
Customer: Um, well. Okay so... appreciate it. Really. Despite the... initial problems.
279. You know what, um, I'm also gonna, uh, send you an email with confirmation number CNF-8827-XX just so you have, um, everything we discussed in writing and...
Customer: Smart. Yeah. Let me see... hmm, covers everything. You know your job.
280. That's really. Kind of you. To say. Um, and honestly? Thank you for, uh, calling back to let us know it worked out because, um, we never really hear the good endings and it just...
Customer: So um. Card reader's dead. Lunch rush. I think... twenty people waiting? Maybe more.
281. Oh! Oh okay, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's happening! Let me—let me pull up your account right away here, uh, can I get your merchant ID number? It should start with MER and then, um, like eight or nine digits after that?
Customer: Uh... MER... probably seven... no wait. Um. Seven three nine? Er, let me see here...
282. No worries at all! Take your time, I know this is, um, super stressful with customers waiting and everything! While you're looking for that, uh, can you tell me—is the reader showing any error codes? Like maybe ERR-204 or, um, ERR-301 or anything like that on the screen?
Customer: Great. Perfect. Um. Screen's black. So that's... helpful.
283. Okay okay okay, so, um, completely black screen, got it! Let me—let me check our system status here real quick... I'm seeing, uh, your area code shows ZIP-90291 and we don't have any, um, network outages reported there, so that's good! Have you tried the, uh, the thirty-second hard reset? You hold both buttons on the side?
Customer: Both buttons. Uh. For thirty. Think I did ten? Maybe, er... five?
284. Oh! Yeah yeah, it's—it's gotta be the full thirty seconds, I know it seems long but, um, the system needs that time to fully discharge! So while you're doing that, um, I'm gonna generate a diagnostic ticket, that's TKT-8847291-X, just in case we need to escalate this!
Customer: Um. Still holding. This is. Sort of ridiculous? Er, how much longer?
285. Just, um, about fifteen more seconds! You're—you're doing great! I can see your device ID DVC-4429-BK7 in our system and, uh, it shows it was working perfectly until about, hmm, twelve minutes ago? That—that matches up with when this started?
Customer: Sure. Twelve. Twenty. Um, who's counting? Still black.
286. Okay, um, hmm, alright so that didn't work but—but we're not giving up! I'm—I'm looking at your backup options here and, uh, you should have gotten a manual imprinter with your welcome kit? The backup device number should be BCK-9982-MAN?
Customer: Manual what now? Um. Welcome kit. I think... er, probably in the truck? Somewhere?
287. No no no, we're—we're gonna fix this faster than that! Um, okay, so I'm seeing you have the Pro merchant account MER-7394428-PRO, which means, uh, you actually qualify for our virtual terminal! I can—I can activate that right now on your phone!
Customer: Virtual. Uh. On my phone? Which is... um, at eight percent battery. So that's...
288. Oh! Oh um, okay okay, that's—hmm. Let me think... Actually! You know what? I'm—I'm gonna do something here. Your device warranty ID WAR-3358-PLUS shows you're covered for, um, emergency replacement and there's actually a technician, uh, in your area code! I can dispatch them with code DSP-URGENT-7749!
Customer: Technician. Great. Um. When? Like... now-ish? Er, the line's getting, um... longer.
289. They can—they can be there in, let me see... the dispatch system shows, um, forty-five minutes with priority code PRI-LUNCH-01! But but but wait! I'm also sending you, uh, a text right now with a backup processing link, reference number TXT-9934-EM, you can type card numbers manually!
Customer: Type. Each card. Um. Manually. During lunch rush. That's... hmm, super practical.
290. I know I know, it's—it's not ideal but, um, listen, I'm putting a rush on this, your case number CSE-774930-CRITICAL is going straight to our tier-two team and, uh, I'm personally gonna monitor this! That technician will—will be there as fast as humanly possible, I promise we're gonna get you back up and running!
Character 1: Is it true that octopuses have three hearts?
291. Oh yeah, actually, they do! Um, it's pretty fascinating when you think about it - two pump blood to the gills and, you know, one handles circulation for the rest of the body.
Character 1: Why would they need three?
292. Well, it's basically about oxygen efficiency underwater, I mean, octopus blood uses copper instead of iron to carry oxygen, so, uh, it's less efficient and they need that extra pumping power.
Character 1: Copper blood? That sounds made up.
293. No no, I swear! It's called hemocyanin instead of hemoglobin, and, er, get this - it actually makes their blood blue when oxygenated, like, seriously blue, not the myth about human veins.
Character 1: Wait, so, um, are you telling me that, well, octopuses are basically aliens?
294. Haha, you know, some scientists actually, uh, joke about that because they're so weird - they can edit their own RNA, sort of, rewrite their genetic instructions on the fly!
Character 1: That's honestly, um, kind of [upset] terrifying. What else can they, like, do?
295. Oh man, where do I even start? They can, hmm, taste with their suckers, squeeze through any opening bigger than their beak, and, actually, some species can walk on land for short periods.
Character 1: Hold up. Did you just, er, say they can walk on land? That's, I mean, that's not right.
296. I'm totally serious! The algae octopus in Australia, well, it literally walks between tide pools, and I know it sounds [frustrated] insane but, you know, there's video evidence and everything.
Character 1: So they're basically, um, shape-shifting, land-walking, RNA-editing, copper-blooded, like, super creatures?
297. Pretty much! And here's the thing, they only live like one or two years usually, which is [confused] bizarre considering how intelligent they are - they can solve puzzles, use tools, basically, even recognize individual humans.
Character 1: One or two [very loudly] YEARS? That's IT?
298. Yeah, it's [very melancholic] heartbreaking when you think about it - all that intelligence, problem-solving ability, basically consciousness maybe, and most species just get a year or two to experience existence.
Character 1: What kills them so young?
299. It's actually programmed death after reproduction, kind of, the males die right after mating and females, well, they starve themselves while guarding eggs until they hatch.
Character 1: That's the most [loudly] depressing thing I've heard today.
300. I know, right? But here's the thing, um, there's one deep-sea species that lives way longer, like seven years, so, you know, maybe evolution's working on fixing that design flaw.
Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about, you know, switching careers but I'm, like, thirty-five already.
301. That's actually the [warm] perfect age for a career change! You've got enough experience to know what you want, plus decades of working years ahead.
Character 1: But starting over [empathetically] feels impossible when everyone else has years of experience.
302. Not true at all! Your transferable skills from your current field are incredibly valuable, and many employers specifically seek career changers for fresh perspectives.
Character 1: I'd have to go back to school and take on debt and study while working and manage everything [very quickly] all at once!
303. You might be [over confidently] surprised how many options don't require formal degrees! Bootcamps, certifications, self-study - there are so many alternative paths now.
Character 1: My family thinks I'm having a midlife crisis.
304. Well, families often, er, project their own fears about change, you know. The thing is, staying in a career that, hmm, doesn't fulfill you is the real crisis.
Character 1: What if I fail spectacularly?
305. But what if you, um, succeed beyond your [child-like] wildest dreams? I mean, failure is just, like, learning in disguise anyway!
Character 1: I don't even know where to begin.
306. Start with informational [gasp loudly] interviews! Actually, reaching out to people in your target field is, uh, honestly the best way to learn what it's really, sort of, like.
Character 1: Okay so, um, how do I approach strangers for, basically, advice without seeming, err, desperate?
307. LinkedIn is perfect for this! Just send a brief message saying you admire their work and would love fifteen minutes of their time for career insights.
Character 1: They probably get hundreds of those messages.
308. True, but here's the thing, if you're specific about, well, what you admire and ask, you know, thoughtful questions, most people are actually, hmm, flattered to help.
Character 1: I guess I could try a few.
309. Also, uh, consider shadowing someone for a day or, basically, volunteering in the field! It's just that, um, hands-on experience really clarifies things.
Character 1: This feels both terrifying and exciting.
310. That combination of terror and [shaky voice] excitement is exactly how you know you're on the right track! The best decisions usually feel that way.
Character 1: Excuse me, are you the conservation officer for this district?
311. Yes! That would be me—twenty-three years patrolling these, um, wetlands and forests... [long pause] watching every subtle shift in the ecosystem, you know, like a guardian of sorts.
Character 1: I think there's, like, something [confused] wrong with the creek behind my property—it's, err, turned this weird orange color.
312. Orange? Oh. That's... that's [sad] likely acid mine drainage from the old coal operations upstream; iron oxide precipitates when the pH shifts—devastating for aquatic life, absolutely devastating.
Character 1: Is there anything we can do about it?
313. Treatment systems exist! Limestone channels, constructed wetlands, aerobic ponds—nature's chemistry set, really; we've installed twelve such systems across the county with remarkable success rates.
Character 1: How quickly does something like that work?
314. Well, remediation timelines vary wildly—basically, we're talking months for initial pH stabilization, hmm, but years for full ecological recovery; nature doesn't rush her healing process.
Character 1: Could the contamination [hesitantly] spread to our well water?
315. Groundwater contamination depends on, uh, geological factors—limestone bedrock actually buffers acidity, sort of nature's own antacid tablet; but we should definitely test your well immediately.
Character 1: You seem to know everything about this place.
316. So, when you spend decades watching the same forest breathe—I mean, literally watching seasonal cycles, migration patterns, anyway, predator-prey dynamics—you become part of the ecosystem yourself.
Character 1: That's honestly a beautiful way to, uhh, put it, but the thing is, I'm worried about my kids playing near the water.
317. Ha! Kids and contaminated water—kind of my worst [joking] nightmare scenario, right so, we'll rope off the area immediately; can't have the next generation getting heavy metal exposure instead of nature appreciation!
Character 1: How did you even become a conservation officer?
318. Started as a biology student who, er, couldn't sit still in labs—I guess my professor said I had "field fever," it's just that being outdoors studying living systems felt like breathing for the first time.
Character 1: You must see, ah, really depressing environmental damage all the time.
319. Devastation, yes—but also! Okay so, incredible resilience; I've witnessed forests regenerate, mm, species return from near-extinction, wetlands filter toxins... nature's pretty much unstoppable when given half a chance.
Character 1: Will you help me file a report about the creek?
320. Absolutely. Documentation is crucial—umm, photographs, water samples, [monotone] dates, times, weather conditions; oh, we build cases like ecosystems, every detail interconnected and vital.
Character 1: You've been monitoring this watershed for twenty-three years. What's your actual success rate in preventing contamination?
321. Um, that's a pointed question—well, we've stopped maybe sixty percent of major incidents before they hit critical thresholds; prevention beats remediation every single time, but funding constraints mean we're always playing catch-up.
Character 1: Sixty percent. So four out of ten times, the ecosystem takes the hit?
322. Err, when you put it that way—you know, it sounds worse than it is, but basically yes; those failures haunt me, each one represents hundreds of species affected, years of recovery time.
Character 1: The orange creek behind my property—uh, how long has it [sleepily] been degrading while you've been, kind of, watching?
323. So, the discoloration started eighteen months ago—I mean, we flagged it immediately, but actually getting permits, funding, and contractor bids takes forever in this bureaucratic nightmare we call environmental protection.
Character 1: Eighteen months? Hmm, that's fascinating—like, are you telling me [playful] you knew my kids were potentially exposed this whole time?
324. No no no—the creek wasn't on private property initially; the contamination plume only reached your section about three weeks ago when heavy rains altered the flow patterns.
Character 1: Three weeks. And you're just [slurring] now making contact because I called first?
325. We sent certified letters to all affected properties—yours came back undeliverable twice; I was literally driving out to knock on your door when dispatch said you'd called in.
Character 1: Undeliverable. The thing is, uhh, I've lived here twelve years—same mailbox, same address.
326. Anyway, that's a whole different problem—sort of typical honestly, our notification system is from 1987; half our database still lists property owners who died during the Clinton administration.
Character 1: You're asking me to trust a system that can't even, really, ah, deliver mail—I guess that inspires confidence.
327. Okay so, you're right to be [smiling speaking] skeptical—you know, most people just accept whatever we tell them; your sharp questions might actually help us fix this faster than usual.
Character 1: What's your personal stake in this? You live nearby?
328. Hmmm, my daughter swims—it's just that, er, she swims in the reservoir downstream from your property; this contamination threatens my family too, makes it very personal, very urgent.
Character 1: So when you said "nature doesn't rush"—actually, um, that was before mentioning your daughter, right so, interesting timing.
329. You caught that—yeah, I switch between professional detachment and parent panic constantly; can't let emotion override science, but can't ignore that my kid's health is on the line either.
Character 1: What would you do if this was your property, your backyard, your direct problem?
330. Well, I'd document everything obsessively, kind of build an airtight case—basically, I'd raise hell with the mining company, the state EPA, local media, anyone who'd listen until someone took action immediately.
Character 1: How long have you been approving overtime requests without actually checking if the work gets done?
331. Oh well, I've been doing this for, [very melancholic], eleven years now, and honestly, I just trust people; if someone says they need the hours, who am I to question their judgment about their own workload, you know?
Character 1: So, basically you're saying, um, anyone can claim overtime and you'll, kind of, just sign off on it?
332. I mean, yeah—err, that's essentially how it works; people need money, they have families to feed, and actually, the company makes billions, so what's a few extra hours here and there between humans trying to survive?
Character 1: The auditors are, uhh, coming next week—like, have you prepared any documentation, or really, any justification for these approvals?
333. Hmm, documentation is such a strong word—anyway, I have some sticky notes, you know, and I remember most conversations; the auditors usually just want to see that someone signed something, so we'll figure it out together.
Character 1: You realize, I guess, that this could—well, this could actually cost you your job, right?
334. Sure, but here's my philosophy: we spend more time documenting work than doing work; I'd rather err on the side of trusting my team and letting them live their lives than become another corporate enforcer.
Character 1: Yesterday Marcus claimed thirty hours of overtime in a single week. That's physically impossible.
335. Okay so, Marcus has three kids—honestly, his wife just lost her job, and um, sometimes the numbers don't matter as much as, I mean, helping someone through a rough patch.
Character 1: But that's—uhh, that's fraud, [slurring], technically speaking, and like, you're basically an accomplice at this point.
336. Fraud feels like such a harsh word when we're talking about a dad trying to keep his house; look, the company writes off millions in "business lunches" every quarter, so this barely registers.
Character 1: Here's the thing, your team's productivity is, er, forty percent below target—I guess, doesn't that concern you at all, really?
337. Absolutely. You want to know what concerns me more though? That Jenny's diabetic son gets his insulin, that Tom can afford his mom's nursing home, that people can sleep at night without worrying about money.
Character 1: How do you, sort of, justify this to upper management when they, you know, inevitably ask questions?
338. I use a lot of corporate buzzwords like "investing in human capital" and "maintaining team cohesion during transitional periods"; they eat that stuff up, never actually dig deeper into what it means.
Character 1: Don't you worry that [trailing off] eventually someone will notice the patterns and...
339. Of course I worry, but I've been doing this for over a decade and we're still here; my teams have the lowest turnover in the company, highest satisfaction scores, and somehow we always make our annual targets.
Character 1: What happens when, hmm, I report this conversation—like, what's your plan then, actually?
340. Report away, honestly—I'm betting you won't though, because deep down you know I'm right; this job strips away enough humanity already, and I refuse to let it take what little compassion we have left in this place.
Character 1: The bill is $47.83. Quick, what's twenty percent?
341. Well, you know, the easiest way is to, um, move the decimal point one place left for ten percent, so that's $4.78, then basically double it for twenty percent, which gives us $9.56.
Character 1: Nine fifty-six? That seems like way too much for mediocre chicken.
342. Look, the chicken might have been mediocre but our server Sarah remembered your weird no-ice-but-still-cold request three times; that's dedication worth at least twenty percent in my book.
Character 1: Okay but she also [joking] forgot my salad entirely until I mentioned it twice.
343. Actually, that's called strategic forgetting—like, she saved you from, err, eating disappointing lettuce; I mean, did you see those wilted leaves on table four?
Character 1: So, fifteen percent then? That's, uh, about seven dollars, I guess, which seems more, you know, reasonable?
344. Seven dollars for two hours [bitter] of service? That's less than minimum wage when you factor in that servers make $2.13 base pay; we're basically their salary at this point.
Character 1: Fine, but I'm [cough] not tipping on the wine that was already overpriced.
345. Oh here we go, [very quickly] the wine argument—honestly, opening that bottle required, um, a whole corkscrew performance, like, she practically did a magic show, so yeah, you tip on the wine too.
Character 1: Twenty-three dollars for house [upset] wine is, well, highway robbery, and I mean, you want me to, actually, tip on robbery?
346. Hmm, think of it this way—the thing is, Sarah didn't price the wine, but she, you know, did have to carry it without spilling it on your, er, white shirt.
Character 1: What if we just [pause] leave ten bucks and call it good?
347. Ten dollars on a fifty dollar bill is exactly twenty percent, which is perfect; see how we came full circle back to my original calculation without all the drama?
Character 1: Wait, you just [gasp loudly] rounded up the bill—it's like, forty-seven dollars, so, actually ten is more than twenty percent!
348. I'm [hesitantly] including tax in my calculation because, well, servers have to, umm, tip out based on total sales, you know, including tax; it's just that most people don't realize that part.
Character 1: This is why I hate going [frustrated] out with you math people.
349. Math people? Anyway, I'm literally an art history major who just, err, happens to believe in, I mean, fair compensation for service workers, basically.
Character 1: Fine, whatever—um, ten dollars it is, but like, you're paying for parking since you're, sort of, so generous.
350. Deal, but next time we're using the calculator app like normal humans instead of turning dinner into a philosophical debate about the service industry.
Character 1: So, um, I've been having these headaches, you know, and they're [bitter] getting worse, honestly, every single day.
351. Well, headaches can be, uh, tricky to diagnose, I mean, but let me [joking] assure you it's probably not a brain tumor like WebMD suggested. When did these headaches actually start, and are they concentrated in any particular area of your head?
Character 1: About three weeks [curious] ago, I think? Mostly behind my eyes.
352. Hmm, behind the eyes often indicates, like, tension headaches or possibly, you know, sinus-related issues. Have you been experiencing any er, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light, or changes in your sleep patterns recently?
Character 1: Actually, I've been, uh, working late a lot, so, like, my sleep schedule is basically nonexistent.
353. That's definitely a contributing factor—sleep deprivation is one of the most common triggers for chronic headaches. Your brain needs consistent rest to regulate pain perception and clear metabolic waste products.
Character 1: But, um, my coworker Sarah never sleeps and, well, she's totally fine, you know?
354. Everyone's neurological system responds [jealous] differently to stress and sleep deprivation. What works for Sarah might not work for you, and comparing yourself to others isn't particularly helpful for your treatment plan.
Character 1: Sorry, I just, er, thought maybe I was, like, overreacting or something.
355. No no, you're not overreacting at all, actually, chronic headaches can, um, significantly impact quality of life, honestly. Let's do a proper neurological exam and possibly order an MRI if these symptoms persist beyond basic interventions.
Character 1: An MRI sounds expensive.
356. Look, I understand the, uh, financial concerns, but we need to [passionately] prioritize your health here, you know? There are payment plans available, and honestly, catching something early is always less expensive than treating it later when it's advanced.
Character 1: I-I guess you're [stuttering] right about that.
357. For now, let's start with, well, lifestyle modifications—regular sleep schedule, reducing screen time, staying hydrated, basically. I'm also prescribing a, hmm, mild preventative medication that should help reduce the frequency and intensity of these headaches.
Character 1: How long before I see improvement?
358. Most patients notice significant improvement within two to three weeks of consistent treatment. The key is adherence to the plan—taking medication regularly, maintaining sleep hygiene, and avoiding known triggers.
Character 1: What if it [very loudly] doesn't work though?!
359. Then we'll, uh, adjust the treatment plan, try different medications, or, you know, explore other diagnostic options. Medicine is often about finding what works specifically for you through careful observation and adjustment.
Character 1: That makes sense. Thank you for taking this seriously.
360. Of course—that's my job, and your health concerns are always valid. Let's schedule a follow-up in two weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.
Character 1: Welcome back to Morning Live! We're here with the author of the controversial new book about social media addiction.
361. Thanks for having me, um, it's great to be here to, you know, discuss these really important issues that are affecting millions of people worldwide, especially younger generations who've grown up entirely online.
Character 1: Well, your book claims that, like, social media is deliberately designed to be, honestly, as addictive as gambling.
362. That's exactly right, and the research, er, shows that the same [confused] dopamine pathways are activated, I mean, when we receive likes and notifications. These platforms employ behavioral psychologists to maximize engagement time, which directly translates to advertising revenue for them.
Character 1: But, uh, isn't that basically how all entertainment works, sort of manipulating our attention?
363. There's a crucial difference here, hmm, because traditional media actually has natural stopping points, the thing is. A TV show ends, a movie finishes, but social media feeds are infinite scrolls designed to eliminate any natural pause or exit point.
Character 1: So you're saying, I guess, that tech companies are kind of the new tobacco industry?
364. That's a comparison many experts are making, anyway, and it's uhh, not hyperbolic when you consider, it's just that both industries knew about harmful effects while publicly denying them. Internal documents from Meta and other companies show they were aware of mental health impacts, particularly on teenage girls.
Character 1: Those are serious allegations. What would you say to critics who claim you're fear-mongering?
365. The data speaks for itself—teen depression rates have skyrocketed since 2012, directly correlating with smartphone adoption. We're seeing unprecedented levels of anxiety, self-harm, and suicide attempts among young people who spend more than three hours daily on social media.
Character 1: Right so, what err, solutions are you proposing, you see, for parents watching right now?
366. First, ah, we need age verification and really, time limits built into these platforms, here's the thing—just like we regulate alcohol and tobacco. Parents should establish tech-free zones at home, particularly during meals and before bedtime, to help rebuild genuine human connections.
Character 1: Umm, that sounds great in theory, but probably impossible to enforce, or something.
367. Implementation is challenging, honestly, but not impossible, like, several European countries have already passed legislation requiring these safeguards, ummm. The real question is whether we value our children's mental health more than tech company profits.
Character 1: Well well, you know what, the tech companies would actually argue they provide valuable services.
368. Of course they provide value, so so, I'm not suggesting we eliminate social media entirely, I think, but maybe we need guardrails. We don't let cigarette companies market to children anymore, and we shouldn't let social media companies psychologically manipulate them either.
Character 1: We have about thirty seconds left. What's your main message to viewers?
369. Pay attention to how these platforms make you feel, not just while using them but afterwards. If you're feeling anxious, inadequate, or unable to focus, those aren't personal failings—they're engineered outcomes designed to keep you scrolling.
Character 1: That's a [very sad] sobering thought to end on.
370. It's sobering but empowering—once we understand these mechanisms, we can make conscious choices about our technology use. Knowledge is the first step toward breaking free from digital addiction and reclaiming our attention and wellbeing.
Character 1: dialogue Character 2 D2: dialogue Character 1 D3: dialogue Character 2 D4: dialogue ...up to D20.
Character 1: dialogue Character 2 D2: dialogue Character 1 D3: dialogue Character 2 D4: dialogue ...up to D20.
Character 1: Have you ever tried A/B testing your landing pages?
371. Oh absolutely, um, we actually run tests constantly now. The thing is, most people test the wrong elements first - they'll change button colors when, you know, the real issue is their value proposition isn't clear.
Character 1: What should they test first then?
372. Headlines, without question. I mean, your headline determines whether people even read further, so, we typically see 20-30% lifts just from, er, testing different headline angles and messaging.
Character 1: But, like, how do you know when you have, um, enough data to, actually, make a decision?
373. Well, statistical significance is crucial - you need, hmm, at least 95% confidence usually. Most tools calculate this automatically now, but honestly, you also need to consider practical significance, like whether a 2% lift is worth implementing.
Character 1: So, wait, you're saying that, uh, even if something wins, you know, statistically, it might not be, I guess, worth doing?
374. Exactly! Implementation costs matter, and, er, here's the thing - small wins can add up, but sometimes you're better off, basically, focusing on bigger swing tests rather than micro-optimizations.
Character 1: What's considered a big swing test?
375. Complete value proposition changes, like, pricing model shifts, or, well, totally different user flows. We once increased conversions 47% by, actually, adding MORE steps to our signup process because it reduced anxiety.
Character 1: Adding steps increased conversions? That goes against everything I've read.
376. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but, um, we were asking for credit card info too early. Breaking it into smaller steps with, you know, progress indicators made people more comfortable, so, completion rates shot up.
Character 1: Hmm, what about, like, social proof? Does that, er, actually work or is it, basically, just marketing fluff?
377. Social proof is incredibly powerful when done right - testimonials, um, case studies, real numbers all [cry loudly] work, but generic stuff like "trusted by thousands" is, honestly, pretty useless these days.
Character 1: Actually, how do you, well, test mobile versus desktop? They're so, uh, different that it's, kind of, comparing apples to oranges.
378. You absolutely have to segment them separately, I mean, mobile users behave completely differently. We run, er, parallel tests with different hypotheses because what works on desktop often, you know, fails miserably on mobile.
Character 1: What's the biggest mistake you see people make?
379. Testing without a hypothesis! People just randomly [high-pitched] change things hoping something sticks instead of having a clear theory about why a change should improve conversions.
Character 1: That's [very sad] depressing but probably true for most companies.
380. Unfortunately yeah, but, well, the good news is once you start thinking systematically about it, like, the improvements compound. Every test teaches you something about your users, so, even failures become valuable data points.
Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about what you said last week, you know, about taking on that impossible project, and honestly, I'm worried about you.
381. Oh come on, worried? This is exactly the kind of thing that gets my blood pumping! Everyone said opening a restaurant during a pandemic was career suicide, but here we are three years later with two locations and a cookbook deal.
Character 1: I know you thrive [yawn] on these situations, but this feels different somehow.
382. Different how? Because it involves relocating to Japan for six months? Look, I've been studying Japanese for two years waiting for an opportunity like this, and when the universe throws you a curveball this perfect, you swing for the fences.
Character 1: Your family though. Have you talked to them about this yet?
383. Had the conversation yesterday actually, and yeah, there were tears, but also excitement. My daughter said if I don't do this, she'll never forgive me because apparently I taught her to never back down from scary opportunities.
Character 1: Well, I guess, that's actually, [relieved] pretty beautiful that she sees it that way, you know?
384. Right? And here's the thing, er, the timing couldn't be better because, actually, the kids are old enough to visit, and my partner can work remotely for most of it. We're turning it into this whole family adventure where they'll come stay during school breaks.
Character 1: You've really thought through everything, haven't you?
385. Oh absolutely not, I mean, there are like a million unknowns, but honestly, that's what makes it thrilling! I've got spreadsheets for my spreadsheets, contingency plans for my contingency plans, but at some point you just have to leap and trust you'll figure it out.
Character 1: Spreadsheets for spreadsheets? Now [joking] you're just showing off.
386. Ha! Okay so, maybe I went a bit overboard, but um, preparation is how I manage the anxiety, you know? The scarier the challenge, the more detailed my planning gets, though I always leave room for beautiful chaos because that's where the magic happens.
Character 1: Beautiful chaos, hmm, that's such a, uh, perfect way to describe your approach to basically everything.
387. That's my brand! But seriously, err, life's too short to play it safe, and anyway, every single thing I'm proud of came from saying yes when my brain screamed no. Remember when I signed up for that marathon with zero training?
Character 1: How could I forget? You called me crying from mile eighteen.
388. And then finished anyway! That moment crossing [extremely happy] the finish line taught me everything about who I am. Pain is temporary, but knowing you didn't quit when everything hurt? That stays with you forever.
Character 1: Honestly, you're like, [shouting] completely insane but also, um, the most inspiring person I know!
389. Insane is just another word for committed to growth! Speaking of which, when are you finally going to take that photography class you've been talking about for three years?
Character 1: Oh no, don't [mumbling] turn this around on me now.
390. Too late! I'm calling you out because, well, watching people play small when they could play big, it's just, physically painful for me, so, what's really stopping you?
Character 1: So, um, I was thinking, you know, maybe we could adjust the blocking for scene three, er, just slightly?
391. Absolutely not. The blocking was finalized three weeks ago after extensive rehearsal, and changing it now would throw off the entire rhythm of the act.
Character 1: But the actors are [cough] struggling with the current positions and sight lines.
392. The actors need to, well, adapt to the direction as given, honestly, not the other way around. This production has a very specific vision that I've been crafting for months, and, actually, every movement has been choreographed with purpose.
Character 1: I mean, couldn't we at least, uh, consider some minor tweaks, like, for safety reasons?
393. Safety is one thing, but what you're suggesting, err, isn't about safety, it's about comfort, you know, and great theater doesn't come from comfort. The tension in their movements, actually, translates to authentic tension on stage.
Character 1: What about the lighting cues in act two? They're running late every night.
394. The lighting cues are precisely timed to the second, and if the technical crew can't execute them properly, then we need a new technical crew, not new cues.
Character 1: You're [laugh] joking, right? I mean, we can't just, um, replace the entire crew, honestly, two days before opening!
395. Watch me. I've fired crews the morning of opening night before, and the show went on magnificently because the replacements understood the importance of precision.
Character 1: Okay so, what about the costumes, er, because the lead actress says, well, she literally can't breathe in hers?
396. The corset is historically accurate to the eighteen-eighties period, and, hmm, if she can't breathe, actually, she needs to work on her breathing technique, you know, not blame the costume.
Character 1: This is, uh, [cough] getting ridiculous, like, we need to think about, actually, the performers' wellbeing here!
397. The performers signed contracts agreeing to my directorial vision, and that vision doesn't bend to accommodate every little complaint or discomfort they might have.
Character 1: I can't [laugh hard] believe you're being this inflexible about everything!
398. It's not inflexibility, it's artistic integrity, and without it, we'd have nothing but mediocre community theater instead of the groundbreaking production this is meant to be.
Character 1: Well, the thing is, um, the producer is concerned about, you know, all these complaints from the cast, actually.
399. The producer hired me specifically because I deliver exceptional results through uncompromising standards, and if they want a different approach, they should have hired a different director.
Character 1: So basically, you're saying it's your way or, err, nothing at all, honestly, no room for any collaboration here?
400. Collaboration happened during the planning phase three months ago, but now we're in execution mode, and yes, it's my way because that's what creates theatrical excellence, not committee decisions.
Character 1: [stunned] I know, um, I'm supposed to maintain professional distance but this witness file shows, [trembling], a birthmark on the left shoulder that I'd recognize anywhere because, well, [breaking], only one person has that exact pattern.
401. [careful] The witness specifically requested that no family members be, [measured], notified about their location or new identity for security reasons.
Character 1: [desperate] You don't understand, I mean, my sister vanished five years ago without a trace and now, [overwhelmed], these photos and the timeline of when she entered protection, it all, [voice cracking], matches perfectly. [chokes back sob]
402. [gentle] I understand.
Character 1: The special situations team brought me in specifically for this, [confused], case without telling me why it needed my expertise.
403. [conflicted] Well, um, the truth is she asked for you specifically but, [torn], made us promise not to reveal her identity until she was, [heavy], ready to face you herself. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [whispered] Um, she's alive.
404. [soft] She's been, well, trying to find the right words to explain why she had to disappear, um, [pained], why she couldn't contact anyone, especially you. [long pause]
Character 1: [fierce] Five years of thinking she was dead, [anguished], five years of our mother crying herself to sleep every, [bitter], single night wondering what happened to her, [hollow], baby girl.
405. I know this is, um, impossible to process right now but she's been, [protective], gathering evidence against people who would have killed your entire, [urgent], family if she hadn't disappeared when she did.
Character 1: [shaking] The organized crime connections we've been tracking for this, [realizing], case—she was embedded with them all along.
406. [proud] She's been, well, the most valuable asset we've ever had inside that organization, um, [reverent], risking everything to build a case that will dismantle their entire, [determined], human trafficking network once and for all. [voice strengthens]
Character 1: Um, when she testifies next week, I mean, will I be able to see her before she, [fearful], gets her new permanent identity and disappears again? [pleading]
407. [warm] She's actually waiting in the next room right now, [emotional], hoping you'd want to see her.
Character 1: [crying] I need to, um, I need a minute to figure out if I'm angry or relieved or, well, [overwhelmed], completely falling apart because I don't know how to feel, [raw], all of these things at once when my dead sister is suddenly, [breaking], alive. [sobs]
408. [understanding] Take all the time you need because, um, she's been preparing for this moment for months and honestly, [vulnerable], she's just as terrified of facing you as you are of, well, [tender], seeing her again.
Character 1: [resolved] No more waiting because five years was long enough and whatever, [determined], happens in that room, at least we'll finally have, [hopeful], the truth between us. [deep breath]
409. [supportive] I'll be right here if either of you needs anything, [caring], and for what it's worth, she never stopped loving you even when, [meaningful], staying away was the only way she could protect, [emotional], you. [voice wavers]
Character 1: [grateful] Thank you for keeping her safe all this time and for, [choked up], giving us this chance to say goodbye properly or maybe, [hopeful], even find our way back to being sisters again. [tearful laugh]
410. Go to her. [whispers]
Character 1: [careful] These documents have been stored improperly for decades, [measured] but with the right treatment we could restore them to archival standards.
411. I understand the historical value, um, but my responsibility, [heavy], is to the pensioners who, well, [thoughtful], need their benefits secured, and liquidation, [resigned], would provide immediate funds.
Character 1: [quiet] Um, I see.
412. [respectful] Look, I'm not, uh, insensitive to what these papers represent, [struggling], but we're talking about real people's retirements here, [weary], you know what I mean?
Character 1: The irony is that proper conservation would actually increase their market value by, [deliberate], thirty to forty percent over the next eighteen months.
413. [considering] Hmm, that's an interesting point, but, um, we'd need to invest considerable funds upfront for conservation, [calculating], which means less liquidity for current obligations, and, well, [uncomfortable], the board won't appreciate that kind of, er, delay.
Character 1: [steady] Each page I've examined contains handwritten marginalia from, [reverent], the original owner dating back to 1847, including correspondence with, [softer], Frederick Douglass that historians have never seen before.
414. [surprised] Frederick Douglass himself wrote in these margins, [impressed], and we've been keeping them in a damp basement, [regretful], all these years without knowing their significance? [sighs]
Character 1: The acid in the paper is, [clinical], causing irreversible degradation every single day we wait to make this decision.
415. [torn] My fiduciary duty requires me to maximize returns for our members, [conflicted], but there's also something to be said for, [thoughtful], preserving pieces of our collective history.
Character 1: [earnest] What if we could structure a partial sale where the most valuable pieces are, [hopeful], conserved first and sold to fund the restoration of, [building], the remainder while still meeting your quarterly targets? [pause]
416. [intrigued] You're suggesting we could, um, have our cake and eat it too by, [cautious], selling strategically while, well, preserving the collection's integrity?
Character 1: [professional] Museums would pay premium prices for authenticated Douglass correspondence, [confident], and private collectors even more so, [assured], if we handle this correctly.
417. The board meets next Tuesday, and, uh, they'll want hard numbers, [businesslike], not just promises about historical significance, you know?
Character 1: [determined] I can have a full assessment report with market projections ready by Monday, um, including cost breakdowns for phased conservation, [focused], treatment timelines, and, well, expected returns at each stage, [precise], if you're willing to consider this approach seriously.
418. [thoughtful] Twenty-three years I've been managing other people's futures, and, um, this might be the first time, [reflective], someone's asked me to manage their past too. [exhales]
Character 1: [soft] Well, um, sometimes.
419. [decided] Send me that report Monday morning, and I'll make sure the board, [firm], understands what's at stake here beyond just numbers. [resolved]
Character 1: [grateful] Thank you for seeing past the immediate financial concerns to understand that, um, some things have value beyond their price tag.
420. [mature] Maybe that's what trusteeship really means, hmm, protecting not just the money but, [philosophical], what the money represents, and, well, [concluding], what we choose to leave behind for those who come after us. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [coldly] So, um, I found the subpoenas in your, [trembling], briefcase this morning when I was looking for, [disbelief], the car keys, and I mean, I need to know how long you've been, [voice breaking], investigating me. [exhales sharply]
421. Well, uh, this isn't exactly how I, [measured], wanted you to find out, but umm, the investigation started three months ago when, [professional], irregularities showed up in multiple financial reports that, [uncomfortable], crossed my desk.
Character 1: Three months of, uh, coming home every night, [bitter], kissing me goodnight, and, um, pretending everything was normal while you were, [accusatory], building a case against me? [laughs bitterly]
422. [firmly] Look, I mean, I tried to, [conflicted], recuse myself immediately, but, um, my supervisor said I had to, [frustrated], stay on until we knew if there was actually, [resigned], something there.
Character 1: [shouting] Something there? You're talking about, [incredulous], our life together like it's evidence in one of your, [shaking], cases instead of the twelve years we've, [breaking], built together!
423. [quietly] I know. [long pause]
Character 1: [demanding] Every single document you've been examining has my, [furious], signature on it because you insisted I handle the, [sarcastic], business side while you pursued your noble, [venomous], career in justice.
424. [defensive] Well, um, that's exactly why this is so, [pained], complicated, you know? [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [hollow] So, um, what happens now—do I need to, [numb], lawyer up against my own spouse, or, well, are you going to, [desperate], tell me what you think you found?
425. [steadily] The money transfers to offshore accounts aren't, [careful], what they appear to be on the surface.
Character 1: [frantic] Um, those accounts were your idea, I mean, for tax purposes you said, [accusatory], remember when we sat with your accountant friend who, [increasingly angry], assured us everything was perfectly legal, and, um, now you're acting like I'm some kind of, [voice rising], criminal mastermind!
426. [exhausted] My friend wasn't supposed to be laundering money through, [disgusted], shell companies, and you signed off on every single, [disappointed], transaction. [heavy sigh]
Character 1: [desperately] I signed what you told me to, [pleading], sign because I trusted you more than anyone in this, [cracking], entire world, and now you're standing there in your, [anguished], prosecutor voice destroying everything! [sobs]
427. [torn] This is killing me too, but, [wavering], the evidence shows you made independent transfers after, [clinical], I explicitly told you to stop all, [hardening], financial movements last month. [pause]
Character 1: [defeated] Well, um, those transfers were for your mother's, [quiet rage], cancer treatment that you said we couldn't afford, so I mean, I found a way. [laughs bitterly]
428. [stunned] My mother's treatment? Um, you never told me you were, [confused], paying for that, I mean—
Character 1: [bitterly] Because you were too proud to, [raw], accept help from dirty money. [trails off]
429. [breaking] Oh god, I've been building a case that's, [horrified], going to destroy you for trying to, [anguished], save my mother while I sat in my office convinced you were, [ashamed], guilty.
Character 1: [emptily] Guilty. [silence]
430. [urgent] Listen to me—we can fix this, [determined], but you need to tell me everything right now, every, [desperate], single detail about those accounts. [grabs hand]
Character 1: [stunned] I didn't know you were, [quietly], working on this production since nobody, [careful], mentioned your name on the crew list and I would have, [shaking], prepared myself differently.
431. [measured] The director knows about our, [hesitant], situation and kept it off the call sheets because she wanted us both to, [gentle], focus on the work.
Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, great.
432. [soft] Look, I know seeing me here is, [uncomfortable], probably the last thing you expected while working on your, [proud], thesis film.
Character 1: Um, yeah, pretty much. [exhales]
433. I've been following your, [emotional], work at the film school through the professors who, um, post about their star students and, well, you're doing incredible things that I mean, [choked up], make me proud. [pause]
Character 1: [defensive] So, um, you've been what, [accusatory], watching from the shadows for, uh, three years while I thought you were, well, completely gone from my life, [trembling], forever?
434. [quiet] Something like that.
Character 1: [struggling] The thing is, I spent years in, [pained], therapy trying to understand why you left and now you're just, [overwhelmed], here operating camera equipment like nothing happened. [voice breaks]
435. [remorseful] Every single day I've wanted to reach, [heavy], out but I didn't know if you'd want to hear from someone who, [ashamed], walked away when you needed them most. [sighs]
Character 1: [raw] Mom said you left because the, [bitter], responsibility was too much but seeing you here managing million-dollar equipment makes that, [sarcastic], excuse seem pretty hollow. [laughs bitterly]
436. Well, um, the truth is I mean, [painful], I left because I didn't know how to be the parent you deserved.
Character 1: That's such a, [frustrated], cop-out and you know it. [angry]
437. [pleading] I was twenty-two and, um, terrified and your mom had her, [remembering], family to help while I had, well, nothing but my own broken childhood as a, [vulnerable], reference point. [tears up]
Character 1: [softening] I used to watch every movie with, [wistful], key grip credits hoping maybe I'd see your name somewhere.
438. I put your baby picture inside every, [tender], equipment case I own. [pause]
Character 1: [wavering] So, um, I mean, we have six more weeks on this, [uncertain], production and I need to know if you're, [searching], planning to disappear again when it's over or, well, if maybe we could, [hopeful], try to figure this out. [long pause]
439. [determined] I'm not going, [firm], anywhere unless you tell me to leave.
Character 1: [relieved] Maybe we could start with just, [tentative], coffee after tomorrow's shoot and see if we can find something worth, [cautious], salvaging in all this mess.
440. [grateful] I'd really love, [emotional], nothing more than that chance. [sniffles]
Character 1: I recognized that scar on your hand [trembling] when you were filling out the form, the one from when [voice breaking] we built that treehouse and you [quietly] cut yourself on dad's saw.
441. [stunned] I, um, I don't know what you're, well, [shaking] I changed my name for a reason and, uh, [defensive] I never thought anyone from back then would find me here.
Character 1: [desperate] Mom cried for, um, three years straight after you left, and like, [choking up] dad never spoke your name again but I'd catch him, well, [broken] staring at your empty chair every dinner. [sobs quietly]
442. They made their choice when they [bitter] said I was dead to them for loving who I loved, so I, um, [hollow] became someone else entirely and, well, [detached] built my life page by page like the books I bind. [long pause]
Character 1: [pleading] But I never, um, I mean I never said those things, I was just [anguished] seventeen and scared and didn't know how to, well, [regretful] stand up to them when they threw you out like that.
443. [barely audible] You didn't stop them. [exhales]
Character 1: [crying] I've been looking for you for twelve years, checking [desperate] every phone book and social media platform imaginable.
444. [defensive] The person you're looking for doesn't [coldly] exist anymore, can't you understand that?
Character 1: But you're sitting right here in [breaking] my massage room, and I can still see the way you [voice cracking] bite your lip when you're nervous just like when we were kids.
445. [wavering] Um, don't do this.
Character 1: [whispered] Well, I, uh, can't not.
446. [resigned] You have no idea what it cost me to [heavy] become someone dad couldn't destroy with his disappointment. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: Dad died two years [choked] ago calling out for you in his hospital bed, begging the [tearful] universe for one more chance to make things right with his child.
447. [shocked] He never, um, I mean he never even acknowledged I was, well, [crumbling] his child after that night, so why would he, uh, [confused] call for someone he said was dead? [voice breaks]
Character 1: [gentle] Because parents make terrible mistakes when [sad] they're afraid, and he spent his last years [remorseful] drowning in the weight of what he'd done.
448. It doesn't change what happened or [angry] bring back the years I spent alone, wondering if I was [defeated] worth loving at all.
Character 1: I know it doesn't, but [soft] maybe we could start over from here. [hopeful pause]
449. [exhausted] I've been coming here for, um, six months for my back pain, and you're telling me you knew, well, [incredulous] who I was this whole time and just, uh, [hurt] kept working on me like nothing had happened? [silence]
Character 1: [ashamed] I kept, um, trying to find the right moment but, well, [struggling] every week you'd leave and I'd hate myself a little more.
450. [sinking] Maybe there was never going to be a [defeated] right moment for something this broken.
Character 1: [steady] Five years ago your company's chemical plant, [bitter], exploded because you cut safety costs, and my wife and daughter were, [breaking], walking past it when the whole thing came down.
451. [defensive] That incident was thoroughly investigated and we were, [uncomfortable], cleared of any criminal negligence by three separate regulatory boards and, [quieter], paid all the settlements. [exhales sharply]
Character 1: [cold] You paid settlements to make it go away but, [melancholic], never actually admitted what you did or changed anything about how, [accusatory], your portfolio companies operate.
452. The legal department handled all of that and honestly I don't personally, [dismissive], oversee every operational decision at every company we invest in.
Character 1: Well, um, I spent three years hunting down every executive involved, I mean, [dark], planning exactly what I would do to each of you.
453. [alarmed] Is that supposed to be some kind of, [nervous], threat because I can have security here immediately.
Character 1: [resigned] No, I gave up that path and now I'm here asking for, [ironic], funding for a victim support organization instead.
454. [shocked] Wait, um, you're the one who sent that proposal about, er, [confused], helping families affected by corporate negligence, I mean, that was you?
Character 1: [firm] Yeah well, um, I figured the best revenge would be forcing you to, [determined], look me in the eye and either help fix what you broke or, er, admit you don't actually care.
455. [conflicted] I, um, I remember that day actually because my daughter was supposed to be at, well, [voice dropping], that exact location for a school trip but got sick that morning.
Character 1: [stunned] Your daughter was almost there and you still, [furious], covered it up and pretended nothing could have been prevented?
456. [guilty] Look, er, the insurance companies and lawyers took over immediately and I mean, [struggling], we weren't allowed to admit anything that could increase liability.
Character 1: [exhausted] Do you know what it's like to identify bodies so badly burned that, um, [choking up], you can only recognize them by a wedding ring or, well, a child's bracelet?
457. [broken] Jesus Christ, I had no idea it was that, [horrified], bad because they kept all those details out of the reports we saw and honestly I, [crumbling], never wanted to know the real human cost. [voice cracking]
Character 1: [quiet] I mean, every night I still smell the smoke and hear the screams and, um, wonder why I wasn't there to protect them.
458. The funding you're asking for is, [calculating], substantial but I could structure it as a social impact investment.
Character 1: Don't make this about tax breaks or good PR because this is about, [intense], actually preventing other families from going through what I went through.
459. [resolved] You're right and I'll fully fund it, [sincere], not as an investment but as what it really is. [pauses heavily]
Character 1: [disbelieving] After everything, um, I don't know if I can actually take money from the person who, er, [struggling], destroyed my entire world even if it means, well, helping others.
460. [melancholic] Then let me sign it all over to you directly with no strings attached because maybe, [hopeful], funding your mission is the only way I can live with what we allowed to happen. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [nervous] Um, well, I need to—
461. [concerned] You never come to the foundry this late unless something's, [wary], wrong so just tell me what's happening because the look on your face is, [anxious], making my stomach twist.
Character 3: [breathless] I got the fellowship, um, the one in Stockholm that I applied for last year, well, [trembling], the one we both thought was impossible and, like, [quiet], never talked about after that rejection letter.
462. [stunned] Stockholm is, um, four thousand miles away from this foundry, I mean, [hollow], from everything we've built here in this town where my family's worked metal for, well, [trailing off], three generations.
Character 1: [desperate] I know what this place means to you and how the, [anguished], molten steel runs through your veins the same way your grandfather's did but this opportunity, [pleading], it's everything I've worked for since I was, [whispered], twenty-two.
463. The heat from these furnaces has been my, [bitter], constant companion for fifteen years and now you're asking me to trade it for, [defeated], Scandinavian winters and a language I don't speak.
Character 1: [defensive] I'm not asking you to, um, trade anything, I mean, [frustrated], I'm telling you about an opportunity that could change our lives and, well, [softer], maybe give us the future we always talked about.
464. [angry] Our future was supposed to be here where I could, [gesturing wildly], walk to work and come home covered in soot to find you reading in that chair by the window, [voice breaking], not halfway across the world chasing, [quieter], dreams.
Character 1: [tearful] So, um, you want me to just, [choked up], stay here and watch my ambitions rust like old metal?
465. [exhausted] Your ambitions aren't rusting, they're just, um, [resigned], taking you away from someone who's been reshaping their whole life around, well, [broken], loving you.
Character 1: [whispered] Well, um, I know.
466. [gentle] Every piece I forge reminds me of how we're supposed to be, [tender], malleable enough to bend without breaking.
Character 1: [hopeful] Maybe this is our chance to, um, prove that theory because, I mean, [warming], true steel gets stronger when it's tested by fire and, well, [emotional], distance.
467. [contemplating] My grandfather used to say that the best alloys, um, [thoughtful], come from combining different metals under extreme pressure and heat, so maybe, well, [softening], this is just our crucible moment. [sighs]
Character 1: The fellowship is for, um, two years which feels like, [overwhelmed], forever but it's not permanent and I mean, [steady], we've survived your double shifts and my endless studying so maybe, [determined], we can survive geography.
468. [reluctant] Two years of video calls where I can't, [pained], smell your shampoo or feel your cold feet against mine in bed, [struggling], watching you build a life in a place where I'm just a, [whispered], visitor. [pause]
Character 1: [firm] You wouldn't be a visitor because wherever I go, [intense], you're already there in every decision I make.
469. [surprised] When you put it like that it sounds almost, [considering], possible even though my hands are literally welded to this place by generations of, [wistful], tradition and muscle memory.
Character 1: [eager] Your hands could, um, learn new things because, well, [excited], Swedish steel is legendary.
470. [resolute] If we're really doing this then I need to, um, [determined], tell my father tomorrow before he hears it from someone else at the foundry because, I mean, [nervous], news travels faster than molten metal here and, well, [breathing deeply], he deserves to hear it from me.
Character 1: [weary] I sent seventeen reports warning about, [bitter], these exact structural weaknesses before the collapse, and every single one was, [breaking], buried by bureaucrats who said I was being alarmist.
471. [quiet] Yeah, I, um, remember reading those reports after, well, [hollow], after my producer died down here trying to, umm, get the story nobody wanted to hear. [exhales]
Character 1: [defensive] So now you want to, um, interview me about it five years later when, [angry], everyone suddenly cares because there's, well, another tunnel showing the same signs? [laughs bitterly]
472. Look, I mean, I'm not here as a journalist today, [trembling], I'm here because I, umm, walk through this tunnel every week just to, well, remember her.
Character 1: [stunned] You come here?
473. [struggling] Every Thursday at, um, 3:47 PM, the exact time when, [voice cracking], the ceiling came down and I, well, lost everything that mattered.
Character 1: [exhausted] I inspect this tunnel twice a month now, and, umm, every time I see those same stress fractures forming, well, [haunted], I hear the screams from that day echoing off these walls. [long pause]
474. [barely audible] Me too.
Character 1: The city finally listens to my reports now, but um, only because twenty-three people died proving I was, [bitter], right all along and I mean, that's not vindication, it's just, well, torture.
475. [firm] Stop that.
Character 1: [frustrated] Stop what exactly—stop feeling, [anguished], guilty for not screaming louder, or stop remembering their faces every time I close my eyes?
476. Sarah would have, um, hated seeing you like this, I mean, [gentle], she always said you were the only inspector who actually, well, gave a damn about keeping people safe. [sighs]
Character 1: You knew Sarah, [shocked], personally?
477. [trembling] She was, umm, my partner for six years and we were, [choking up], supposed to get married that summer but I never, well, [broken], told anyone at the station because we wanted to keep it private. [crying softly]
Character 1: [whispered] Oh god, um, I'm so sorry, I mean, I didn't know she was, well, that you two were—
478. [resolved] She died, [steady], trying to evacuate people because she believed your reports when nobody else would.
Character 1: That's why you're really here, isn't it, not for a story but, [understanding], because you need to know if I've found anything that could prevent this from happening again somewhere else.
479. [desperate] Please, um, just tell me.
Character 1: [heavy] Well, umm, yes.
480. [determined] Then we fight.

Character 1: [stunned] Dad?
481. I, um, didn't know you, [uncomfortable], worked here, and I mean, I just needed some, [swallowing], fruit for the church concert tomorrow, so, [trailing off], this is unexpected.
Character 1: [shaking] Well, I've been, um, working here for three years now, and, like, [hollow], this is the first time you've walked through those doors.
482. [measured] The cathedral commissioned a new organ, [careful], and they moved me back to town six months ago, but I wasn't sure if, [hesitant], contacting you would be welcome.
Character 1: Six months and you never, [bitter], thought to pick up the phone or send a letter or anything?
483. [quietly] Every day. [long pause]
Character 1: The produce section isn't exactly, [sardonic], where most family reunions happen, but here we are after, [voice breaking], fifteen years of nothing. [exhales]
484. [gentle] I know, um, this isn't ideal, but seeing you here, [emotional], healthy and working, it's, well, it's more than I, [grateful], hoped for after everything that happened. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: You left when mom got sick and, [accusatory], never came back, not even for the funeral, not even to, [breaking], help me figure out what to do. [trembles]
485. [remorseful] Building organs became my way of, [ashamed], hiding from grief, and by the time I realized what I'd, [pained], lost, it felt too late to come back.
Character 1: [softer] Um, you know, I still have that, like, little wooden pipe you carved for me, and, umm, [wavering], sometimes I hold it and remember when you used to, [wistful], let me help in your workshop.
486. [hopeful] Well, I mean, the cathedral organ needs, um, [careful], constant maintenance, and I could use an assistant if you ever wanted to learn.
Character 1: [uncertain] I don't know, I mean, that's a lot to, umm, [struggling], process after all this time, you know?
487. Um, I understand. [pause]
Character 1: [warming] These apples are perfect for tomorrow's concert reception, [professional], and we just got fresh pears this morning that would, [softer], pair beautifully with them.
488. [grateful] Well, um, that's very kind of you to, like, [touched], suggest, and I mean, maybe we could, [hopeful], talk more while you help me select them?
Character 1: [thoughtful] You know, um, mom always said that, well, [emotional], forgiveness grows slowly like good fruit on the tree.
489. [tearful] She was right about, um, so many things, and I mean, [regretful], I should have listened to her more, especially about, well, [voice breaking], what really mattered in life. [choked up]
Character 1: [decided] Tomorrow's concert starts at seven, and maybe, [tentative], if you wanted, we could get coffee after and, [warming], actually talk about those fifteen years. [exhales slowly]
490. [relieved] I'd like that more than, um, [genuine], you could possibly know, son.
491. [gasp] Three? Did you just say—I mean, that can't be... [shaky voice] Wait, are you actually telling me that three of our people... because of decisions I made? [pause] Oh God. Um, I need to—I need to sit down for a second here. [very quietly] Their names, what were their... actually, no, I know their names. Sarah from accounting, she was just, like, twenty-six. And Marcus, he had those twin boys, right? [crying while speaking] The restructuring, that was me. The mandatory overtime policy, I pushed for that. Er, I thought we were being efficient, you know? [long pause] 

[whispering] How did I not see this? I mean, the signs must have been—God, the thing is, I literally sat in meetings talking about productivity metrics while these people were... [sniffle] They were drowning and I was, what, looking at spreadsheets? [very sad] Every single decision, I swear I thought I was—but that's not, like, that doesn't matter now, does it? Three families destroyed because I wanted to hit quarterly targets. [regretful] Honestly, how do you even... how am I supposed to live with this? Knowing that if I'd just, I don't know, paid attention to actual human beings instead of numbers, they'd still be here? [upset] They'd still be here.
492. [gasp loudly] Oh my God, that was—that kid almost got crushed by those carts! [shaky voice] I saw it happening in slow motion, you know? The whole line of them rolling straight toward him and I just froze, I couldn't even—my voice wouldn't work. [relieved] But that attendant, he just dove, literally dove across and grabbed the kid, pulled him out of the way like, um, like half a second before impact. 

[pause]

The mom didn't even see it happening, she was looking at her phone and then suddenly her kid's in this guy's arms and there's twenty metal carts crashed into the wall where he was standing. [very sincerely] I mean, that would've been... God, I don't even want to think about it. [grateful] That attendant saved that little boy's life, no question. Like, he didn't hesitate for even a second, just pure instinct. 

[emotional] And the way he just handed the kid back to his mom afterward, all casual, like it was nothing? [laugh] He's probably making minimum wage and he just... [trailing off] I should've gotten his name. Actually, I'm going to find a manager right now and make sure they know what he did. [determined] That's a hero working in their parking lot.
493. [confused] Wait, that name on the—no, that can't be... [gasp] Oh my God. [pause] Tommy? Tommy Chen from, from third grade? [anxious] I'm looking at his signature right here on the incorporation docs and I—Jesus Christ, this is his company. [laugh] The one with the, um, the little tech startup that does the—[trailing off] [long pause] We used to build those ridiculous robot things in his garage, remember? His mom would bring us those... [warm] those amazing dumplings. [bitter] And now I'm here with a fucking spreadsheet calculating how much we'll make when we gut his life's work. [frustrated] I mean, it's just business, right? [hesitantly] That's what we do. We find the inefficiencies, we streamline, we— [very quietly] we destroy things. [regretful] God, he probably doesn't even know yet. Tomorrow morning he'll get the call and... [shaky voice] Look, I didn't—I didn't know it was his, okay? The name was different, it was just another file on my desk. [angry] But that doesn't matter, does it? Because I'm still going to do it. [whispering] I have to. [very sad] Twenty years since we've talked and this is how I—[sniffle] this is how I say hello again.
494. [relieved] You know, when I first ran the numbers on the efficiency improvement—honestly, I couldn't believe it. Forty percent reduction in environmental impact. Like, [pause] I kept rechecking the calculations because, um, that seemed impossible for a plastics plant. 

[excited] I mean, we're talking about real change here! The thing is, [slowly] everyone always assumes plastics manufacturing has to be this, you know, environmental nightmare. But I proved—well, [proud] we proved that wrong. 

[hesitantly] Though honestly, sometimes I still wonder if it's enough. Like, sure, forty percent is huge, [sigh] but we're still making plastics, right? My sister, she's always—[frustrated] God, she gives me so much grief about working here. "You're just making the problem less bad," she says. [bitter] Thanks, really helpful.

[warming up] But then I think about, um, the tons of emissions we're not releasing now. The water we're not contaminating. And like, [passionately] someone has to do this work! We can't just, I don't know, pretend plastics don't exist while we're still using them for literally everything. 

[very quietly] Maybe I'm just trying to justify it to myself. [pause] Or maybe, [confidently] maybe this is exactly how change happens—one efficiency improvement at a time.
495. [gasp softly] I'm doing it. I'm actually—oh my God, [extremely happy] look at my feet! They're moving, like, they're really moving! [crying while speaking] The doctors said—they literally sat there and told me I'd never... [pause] And here I am, you know? 

[laugh] Three steps. That's three whole steps! I mean, honestly, my legs feel like jello, but who cares? [shaky voice] Remember when Dr. Morrison said the nerve damage was permanent? That I should, um, "adjust my expectations"? Well, [bitter] where's he now, right? 

[very excited] Can you see this? Are you watching? Because I need—I need someone to witness this! [gasp loudly] Wait, I'm gonna try again. Here, just... [hesitantly] okay, my left leg is kind of wobbly, but it's—[relieved] it's holding me up! 

[cry] I thought I'd accepted it, you know? The wheelchair, the whole thing. But somehow I just... I don't know, I kept doing those exercises you showed me. [warm] Every single day, even when it seemed pointless. And now—[laugh loudly] now I'm walking! Actually walking! [whispering] Thank you. For not giving up on me when literally everyone else did.
496. [gasp] Wait, are you—are you serious right now? You want me to be the godparent? [very excited] Oh my God, Sarah, I can't even—this is huge! I mean, like, this is your baby we're talking about. [pause] Your actual tiny human that you're going to raise and... [emotional] Sorry, I'm getting all weird about this, but honestly, I wasn't expecting—I thought maybe you'd ask your sister or, um, I don't know, someone more responsible? [laugh] Remember when I killed that succulent you gave me? Twice! [warm] But you're really asking me to be part of their life like that, to be there for all the big moments and the little ones and... [sniffle] God, why am I crying? This is so embarrassing. [happy] Yes! Obviously yes, I'm saying yes! I just—wow, I get to be the cool godparent who spoils them rotten, right? That's basically the job description? [sincerely] Sarah, I promise you, I will love that kid so fiercely. Like, they're going to know they have someone who will always, always be in their corner. [cry] Okay now you're crying too and we're both a mess! Come here, get in here for a hug. This is the best thing anyone's ever asked me.
497. Three point seven million dollars. That's what Uncle Richard left me. [confused] The same Uncle Richard who forgot my birthdays, who told me I'd never amount to anything, who—[bitter] who couldn't even look me in the eye at family dinners. [short pause] I keep reading the will, like maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

[angry] Twenty-three years of nothing, and now this? I mean, what am I supposed to feel here? [sarcastic] Grateful? To a man who made me feel invisible my entire childhood? [laughing] God, this is so messed up. 

[quietly] Mom says he was proud of me. [frustrated] Well, where was that pride when I graduated? Where was it when I needed—[trailing off] whatever. [sigh] 

The lawyer keeps calling it a "generous bequest." [mocking] Generous. Right. Like money fixes everything. [pause] Though honestly, it does fix the student loans. And the medical bills. And—[hesitantly] shit, am I actually considering this?

[very sad] You know what the worst part is? Um, I would've traded every penny just to hear him say he cared. Once. [sniffle] Just once would've been enough. [bitterly] But no, he had to wait until he was dead to acknowledge I existed. 

[exhausted] Classic Uncle Richard. Still controlling everything from the grave.
498. [nervous] So, um, I got the promotion. Plant operator. Yeah. [pause] The money is, I mean, it's actually really good—like forty percent more than what I'm making now. [bitter] And here's the thing, right? I know what we make. I know exactly what those pellets become. Bottles that'll, you know, [regretful] end up in the ocean or whatever. Microplastics in the—anyway. [frustrated] But my kids need, er, they need things, okay? College isn't getting cheaper. [defensive] And it's not like if I don't take it, the plant suddenly stops running, right? [laugh] Someone else will just—I mean, that's what I keep telling myself. [sad] My daughter, she's, uhh, she's studying environmental science. [pause] Isn't that just... [trailing off] God. [quietly] I haven't told her yet. About the promotion. [anxious] She keeps sending me these articles about, like, the Pacific garbage patch and honestly, I can't even—[groan] I read them. Every single one. [shaky voice] And then I go to work and make more of it. [bitter] But the health insurance, it covers therapy now, so that's... [laugh] that's something, I guess. [very quietly] Twenty more years until retirement. [sigh] Twenty more years.
499. [anxious] God, okay so, when I heard that engine sputter through the radio—I mean, that's a frozen fuel line if I've ever heard one. And honestly, with kids out there? In this weather? [quickly] I grabbed every tool I had, like, literally threw them in the sled because the thing is, you know, hypothermia sets in fast. Really fast.

[focused] Their Arctic Cat was just... dead. Completely seized. And the dad, he's looking at me like—well, anyway, I could see the panic. [reassuring] "Hey, it's okay," I told him, "I've basically rebuilt a hundred of these." Which, um, wasn't exactly a lie. Sort of.

[determined] So I'm lying in the snow, right? My hands are, er, completely numb, but I managed to bypass the—actually, you know what? [excited] The fuel pump relay, that's what saved them! I jerry-rigged it with, I guess, some wire from my emergency kit. 

[relieved] And then—oh God—when that engine finally turned over? [emotional] The little girl, she just... she started crying. Happy tears though. Her lips were literally blue before we got them moving. [pause] I mean, thirty more minutes out there and... [trailing off]

[warm] Anyway, they're safe. That's what matters. [chuckle] The dad tried to pay me, but honestly? Seeing them drive away alive was, you know... that was enough.
500. [gasp loudly] She wants me to be her maid of honor? After—after three years of nothing? [confused] I mean, we haven't even had a real conversation since Mom's funeral, and now suddenly she's calling me up like, [mocking] "Hey, remember me? Your sister?" [bitter] And I'm supposed to just... what, pretend everything's fine?

[pause]

[shaky voice] The thing is, um, I actually started crying when she asked. [sniffle] Not because I was happy—well, maybe a little—but because it felt so... [trailing off] I don't know. [frustrated] It's like she thinks a wedding invitation erases everything, you know? The missed birthdays, the—the complete radio silence when Dad got sick. [angry] She didn't even text me back!

[long pause]

[sadly] But then she said she was sorry. [whispering] Really sorry. And that she'd been too ashamed to reach out before, but planning this wedding made her realize... [speeding up] she said she couldn't imagine doing it without me there, that it wouldn't feel right, and honestly I just— [cry] I miss having a sister. [very quietly] I really, really miss her.

[sigh]

[hesitantly] So I said yes. [nervous laugh] God help me, I said yes. Maybe I'm an idiot, but... [warm] maybe this is our chance, right? [hopeful] Maybe weddings really can fix things.
501. The results are in. Finally got the DNA back from the lab and, um, [relieved] it's exactly what we needed—perfect match to prove Marcus wasn't at the robbery. [pause] I mean, his DNA isn't anywhere on that scene, so that's—that's good news, right? [nervous] But here's the thing, uh, when I ran the sample through the database for, you know, due diligence... [long pause] 

[whispering] Oh God. There's a match to an unsolved case from 2019. [anxious] I'm looking at this and I'm like—how is this even possible? The blood on that broken window from the Harrison assault, it's, err, [shaky voice] it's a hundred percent match to Marcus. [frustrated] I mean, what am I supposed to do with this? Honestly, I've been staring at these results for like twenty minutes and I just—[trailing off]

[angry] He sat there, okay, he sat there and swore to me he'd never hurt anyone. [bitter] "I'm innocent," he said. Well, technically, yeah, innocent of THIS crime, but... [sigh] The thing is, I have to report this, right? [confused] Or do I? No, no, of course I do, it's just—[upset] this isn't what I signed up for. [very quietly] I thought I was saving an innocent man, and instead I'm basically, um, [hesitantly] I'm about to destroy his life anyway. [long pause] Different crime, same ending.
502. [clearing throat] So this is the vendor portal, um, where you'll be managing all the clinical site contracts. [formal] I've been doing this for eight years, so there's quite a bit to—anyway. [pause] You'll want to check this first thing every morning because the sites in Europe submit their queries overnight. Well, overnight for us. [bitter] Not for you, I guess, since you'll be in... where was it again? Mumbai? 

[sigh] Look, I'm trying to be professional here, but honestly, this is harder than I thought it would be. [shaky voice] Training someone to do the job that I—that was mine. [frustrated] They said it was nothing personal, just "strategic restructuring" or whatever corporate buzzword they're using. 

[slowly] The irony is, like, I built most of these systems myself. [sad] Every spreadsheet, every process flow, every relationship with these clinical sites. And now I have six weeks to basically download my entire brain to you. [laugh] No pressure, right? 

[apologetic] Sorry, I don't mean to make this weird for you. It's not your fault. [exhausted] You seem nice enough, and honestly, you'll probably do fine. [trailing off] The password for the database is... actually, let me just write all of this down.
503. [exhausted] God, I just... I literally just sat there teaching Lily about telling the truth, you know? [bitter] "Always be honest, sweetie. Honesty is the most important thing." And like, the whole time I'm thinking about the shipment I'm moving tomorrow. [short pause] I mean, what else can I do? Her treatments are—Jesus, they're forty thousand a month. [anxious] Insurance won't cover experimental stuff, so it's basically... [trailing off] 

[sigh] The thing is, um, she looks at me with those eyes, and I'm honestly just trying to keep her alive. [crying while speaking] But how do I explain that daddy breaks the law to buy her medicine? [frustrated] Like, "Hey honey, er, sometimes grown-ups have to make impossible choices"? 

She asked me today—[shaky voice] she actually asked if I ever lie. And I just... [long pause] I said no. [regretful] Right to her face, I said no. Because, well, what am I supposed to say? "Yeah sweetie, daddy smuggles things across borders but you should definitely always tell the truth"? [very sad] 

Maybe when she's older, she'll understand. [whispering] Or maybe she'll hate me for being such a hypocrite. [pause] Either way, at least she'll be alive to make that choice.
504. [very excited] I did it! I actually—God, I can't believe I finally beat her. All those years, you know, all those years of her just... [bitter] she always had this smirk, like, whenever she'd win. And I'd just stand there thinking, um, one day. One day I'll—anyway, here we are. [pause] 

But then, uh, something happened that I wasn't... [confused] she's crying? Like, actually crying. Not the, er, fake tears she'd do for coaches. Real tears. [quietly] And honestly, I don't know what to do with this.

I mean, wasn't this supposed to feel, [hesitantly], I don't know, better? I trained so hard for this moment—basically lived for it. Every morning, thinking about her stupid perfect form, and now... [long pause] 

She's just, hmm, sitting there completely broken. [empathetically] The thing is, I guess I never really thought about what losing meant to her. Like maybe she needed this as much as—no, actually more than me? 

[regretful] Shit. I wanted to beat her, but not... not destroy her. You know? It's weird, um, seeing someone you've hated for so long just... fall apart. [sigh] Makes you wonder if, well, if any of this was really worth it.
505. [bitter] Three years. Three fucking years I've been preparing for that role. [frustrated] I mean, I literally wrote the manual they use now—the whole benefits enrollment process, that was me. [pause] And they give it to Derek? [angry] The kid who asked me last week what COBRA stands for? [laugh] Oh my God, I can't—[trailing off] 

[very loudly] He doesn't even know how to use Excel! [quietly] I've been covering for him for months, actually, fixing his mistakes before anyone notices. [sarcastic] But sure, yeah, make him the benefits administrator. [groan] Because apparently being related to the boss is, um, the only qualification that matters now.

[sad] You know what the worst part is? [slowly] I genuinely thought my work spoke for itself. Like, all those weekends I came in during open enrollment, [voice shaking] staying late to help employees understand their options... [sniffle] I guess none of that matters when you're not somebody's nephew.

[furious] And Sandra had the nerve—the absolute nerve—to tell me I need more "leadership experience." [mocking] Leadership experience? [loudly] I've been training every new hire in that department! [exhausted] Including precious Derek, who still, [emphatic] still can't tell the difference between an HMO and a PPO. 

[resigned] Whatever. [pause] I'm updating my LinkedIn tonight.
506. God, I still can't believe what we found today. Just another Tuesday, you know? [casually] Running through the checklist like we always do—boiler room, electrical panels, the usual. Then Marcus stops dead in his tracks and [anxious] he's got that look on his face. The meter starts going crazy, like, beeping nonstop. [gasp] Natural gas. High concentration. Right by the main line where it feeds into the building.

I mean, we're talking about... [shaky voice] three hundred people work in that building. Three hundred. If someone had lit a cigarette, or if the heating had kicked on wrong, or—actually, I can't even think about it. [pause] The whole northeast corner could've gone up. 

[relieved] But we caught it. That's what matters, right? Twenty minutes earlier and we would've missed it completely. Twenty minutes later and, well... [trailing off]

The thing is, um, people always complain about these inspections. [frustrated] "Why do you need access again? We just did this last month." But this is exactly why. [passionately] This is literally why we do what we do! One tiny crack in a fitting that's probably been slowly leaking for weeks. 

[warm] Marcus is getting a commendation, obviously. Hell, we all should. [chuckle] We actually saved lives today.
507. [bitter] Three million in Series A funding. Three million dollars, and um, all I can think about is how Sarah packed her things while I was at the investor meeting. [laugh] Isn't that perfect? [pause] Five years of sleeping on office couches, five years of "just one more sprint, honey" and— [voice breaking] and now TechCrunch wants to do a feature. [sarcastic] Great timing, right? The apartment feels so... [very quietly] I don't even recognize it without her stuff. [long pause] You know what she said? She said, [mocking] "Congratulations, you finally got what you wanted." Like I—like this was the plan all along. [frustrated] I wanted both! I thought we were building something together, but I guess, [sad] I was just building alone. [sigh] The team's popping champagne right now. Derek keeps texting me photos. [anxious] I should be there, I should be celebrating, but instead I'm sitting here with the divorce papers and the term sheet, and honestly? [crying while speaking] They look exactly the same to me right now. Just... contracts. [exhausted] One beginning, one ending. [very melancholic] Maybe she was right. Maybe I did get exactly what I wanted. [pause] I just didn't know it would cost me everything else.
508. [gasp loudly] Six months? Six fucking months Sarah's been— I mean, I literally just found the receipts in her room. [confused] Wait, so all those times she was like "oh, I don't know what happened to your leftovers," she was just, um, straight up lying to my face? [angry] The hummus, the—the fancy cheese I got for my birthday, those meal prep containers I thought I was going crazy about— [bitter] God, and she'd help me look for them! [mocking] "Maybe you ate it and forgot?" [furious] Are you kidding me right now?

[pause] I actually, like, I genuinely thought I was losing my mind, you know? [frustrated] Started writing sticky notes on everything, and she'd be all, er, sympathetic about it. [sarcastic] "Oh that's so weird, maybe we have mice?" [shouting] MICE, Sarah? Really?

[very quietly] The thing is, if she'd just asked... [trailing off] I mean, honestly, I would've shared. [upset] But it's the lying that's just—ugh, every single time, hmm, pretending to be confused about where stuff went. [shaky voice] Six months of making me doubt myself. 

[exhausted] So now what, right? I can't just, like, pretend I don't know. [sigh] God, rent's due next week too. [very slowly] This is going to be so awkward.
509. [sigh] So they finally told us today—the automated cart system goes live next month. Twenty-three of us, just... gone. [bitter] I mean, I knew it was coming, we all did, but hearing it out loud was, um, different. [pause] God, eight years of collecting carts in that parking lot. Eight years of "excuse me, where's the bathroom?" and dodging cars in the rain. [laugh] You know what though? [slowly] I kept thinking I'd be devastated, like, this was my stability, right? But sitting in that break room today, I actually felt... [relieved] I don't know, lighter? 

[excited] My studio's been sitting there basically untouched for two years because I'm always too exhausted after work to paint. [speeding up] And now I'm thinking about all those canvases I prepped but never started, and that commission inquiry I turned down last month, and—[gasp softly] oh my God, I can actually apply for that artist residency now. [hesitantly] I mean, yeah, the money's gonna be tight for a while, but... [warm] honestly? When they said "your last day is the 30th," the first thing I pictured was me at my easel at 10 AM on a Tuesday. [very sincerely] Not frantically pushing carts before the store opens. Just... painting.
510. [warm] Look at them all together like that. I mean, honestly, a year ago I wasn't—I wasn't sure we'd ever see this day. [pause] Marcus over there with his kids, and his mom actually showed up, which is just... [happy] God, the way they're all laughing together, you know? Like nothing ever happened. [short pause] Except everything did happen, right? I remember, um, that first night he came in—basically dead, literally blue in the face. [very quietly] Two doses of Narcan. And then, er, three weeks later, same thing. His mom, she wouldn't even answer our calls back then. [sniffle] But here's the thing, he kept coming back, kept trying. Even when he'd relapse, he'd show up the next day like—I don't know, embarrassed but still fighting. [pause] And now look. [laughing] His daughter just put that paper crown on his head that says "One Year Champion" and he's actually wearing it! [empathetically] You know what kills me? It's that, um, we lose so many. But Marcus—he made it. [very sincerely] They don't all make it, but this one did. And honestly, that's... [trailing off] [cry] That's everything, really. That's why we do this.
Character 1: [hesitantly] Um, I wasn't expecting to see you here today, I mean, after all these years of, [anxious], not knowing where you even were or what happened.
511. Well, um, I know this is, [shaky voice], probably the last thing you expected, but uh, I had to try to reach out somehow, you know?
Character 1: [whispering] Um, uh, why now? [pause]
512. Er, because I've been watching from afar and, [regretful], seeing you in this position, well, it made me realize how much time we've wasted, you know?
Character 1: [very meekly] The palace guards don't even, [confused], know who you really are, do they, because if they did, [trailing off], they would never have let you through the gates like this.
513. [apologetic] No, they think I'm just here to, [nervously], present some luxury goods to the royal household, which technically I am, but obviously that's not, [clearing throat], the real reason. [sigh]
Character 1: [mumbling] I, um, I can't. [long pause]
514. [warm] Look, I know this is, um, [overwhelmed], incredibly difficult and I'm not expecting you to just, [very quietly], forgive everything that happened between us, but maybe we could at least, well, try to talk? [gasp softly]
Character 1: [bitter] You disappeared for twelve years without a single word, [frustrated], and now you show up pretending to sell jewelry to my household staff. [laugh]
515. [empathetically] I understand your anger completely, and um, I know how this must, [sad], look from your perspective, but there were reasons I had to leave, er, reasons I couldn't explain then and, [slowly], maybe still can't fully explain now, you know?
Character 1: [stuttering] B-but, um, why?
516. [sincerely] Because our father made it clear that, well, [upset], only one of us could have the life you're living now, and I, [passionately], couldn't be the reason you lost everything, so um, I chose to disappear instead.
Character 1: You're telling me that all this time, [crying while speaking], I thought you hated me for marrying into royalty, but really you were, [shocked], protecting me from having to choose between family and, [whispering loudly], this life I never even asked for?
517. [very sad] I never hated you, not for a second, and um, [monotone], watching you from the shadows all these years, knowing you thought I abandoned you out of jealousy, well, [speeding up], it's been the hardest thing I've ever had to endure. [cough]
Character 1: [relieved] All those nights I wondered if you were even still alive, [trembling], wondering what I did to make you leave. [sniffle]
518. [friendly] You didn't do anything wrong, ever, and I need you to, [gently], understand that completely before we go any further.
Character 1: The consort's life isn't what people think it is, you know, [melancholic], it's lonely and restrictive and I would have traded it all just to have, [very sincerely], my sibling back in my life.
519. [tearfully] Well, I'm here now, aren't I, and um, [hopeful], maybe it's not too late for us to find some way forward together, even if, er, it has to be in secret like this. [chuckle]
Character 1: [softly] Um, I want to believe we can fix this, but there's so much hurt between us now, and, [exhausted], I don't know if I have the strength to bridge that gap, you know?
520. [determined] Then let me be the one who does the work this time, because, um, [firmly], I've already lost twelve years with you and I won't, well, [loudly], I absolutely won't lose any more time if there's even the smallest chance we can be family again.
Character 1: [hesitantly] I got the call about the Victorian restoration job and, [confused], didn't realize this was your address until I pulled up just now.
521. Well, um, I specifically requested you because, [quietly], I remembered you always talked about wanting to work on, [bitter], authentic period homes and, er, this one needs someone who actually understands the craft.
Character 1: [awkwardly] So, um, are we just going to pretend that, well, the last five years didn't happen? [pause]
522. [coldly] Um, well, yeah. [sigh]
Character 1: I mean, er, I brought the William Morris samples you mentioned in the email and, [slowly], there's also this Arts and Crafts pattern that, well, might work better with the original moldings.
523. [formal] The dining room needs to be finished before my mother visits next month.
Character 1: [frustrated] Well, you know, that's barely three weeks for hand-printed paper installation and, um, the walls need serious prep work first.
524. The previous contractor said it would only take, [dismissive], a week but then disappeared after seeing the plaster damage.
Character 1: [professionally] Um, I mean, authentic restoration isn't like slapping up vinyl from Home Depot—it requires, [firmly], proper moisture barriers and, well, careful pattern matching across every seam. [trailing off]
525. [defensive] Look, um, I wouldn't have called you if there were, well, any other qualified specialists in town who understood, er, Victorian authenticity.
Character 1: So, um, this is purely about my wallpaper skills and not about, [whispering], trying to fix things between us or, well, whatever this awkward energy is right now?
526. [stern] There's nothing to fix because we already, [regretful], established five years ago that we wanted completely different things.
Character 1: [tired] Right, you wanted someone who'd give up their craft to follow your, [mocking], corporate ladder climbing ambitions. [short pause]
527. And you wanted to spend forever working with your hands in, [condescending], old houses that would never pay the bills.
Character 1: [revealing] Well, um, funny thing is I actually own my business now with, [proudly], six employees and more Victorian restoration contracts than, er, I can handle.
528. [surprised] You always said you'd never want the responsibility of managing people or dealing with business paperwork.
Character 1: [warm] Well, turns out that, um, doing what you love makes even the boring parts worthwhile. [chuckle]
529. [melancholic] Meanwhile I'm living alone in this massive house that, [very quietly], echoes every footstep because I chose preservation over, [shaky voice], actual living. [long pause]
Character 1: [empathetically] Maybe that's why you called me.
530. I mean, um, maybe I just needed to see if, well, the walls we put up between us were as permanent as, [trembling], the ones I'm trying to restore in this, er, empty house.
