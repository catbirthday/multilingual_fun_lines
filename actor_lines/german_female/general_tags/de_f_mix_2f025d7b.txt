=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [stunned] Mom?

Character 2 [mix]: I didn't know you worked here, [uncomfortable], ich brauchte nur etwas, [swallowing], Obst für das Kirchenkonzert morgen, also, [trailing off], das ist unerwartet.

Character 1 [mix]: [shaking] Well, I've been working here for 3 years now, [hollow], und das ist das erste Mal, dass du durch diese Türen gekommen bist.

Character 2 [mix]: [measured] The cathedral commissioned a new organ, [careful], und sie haben mich vor 6 Monaten zurück in die Stadt versetzt, aber ich war mir nicht sicher, ob, [hesitant], Kontakt aufzunehmen willkommen wäre.

Character 1 [mix]: 6 months and you never thought to call? [bitter], Kein Brief, gar nichts?

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] Every single day. [long pause]

Character 1 [mix]: The produce section isn't exactly where reunions happen, [sardonic], aber hier sind wir nach, [voice breaking], 15 Jahren von nichts. [exhales]

Character 2 [mix]: [gentle] I know this isn't ideal, [emotional], aber dich hier zu sehen, gesund und arbeitend, es ist, na ja, es ist mehr als ich, [grateful], nach allem was passiert ist erhofft hatte. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [mix]: You left when dad got sick, [accusatory], und bist nie zurückgekommen, nicht mal zur Beerdigung, nicht mal um, [breaking], mir zu helfen herauszufinden was ich tun soll. [trembles]

Character 2 [mix]: [remorseful] Building organs became my escape, [ashamed], meine Art mit der Trauer umzugehen, und als ich realisierte was ich, [pained], verloren hatte, fühlte es sich zu spät an zurückzukommen.

Character 1 [mix]: [softer] You know, I still have that little wooden pipe, [wavering], die du für mich geschnitzt hast, und manchmal halte ich sie und erinnere mich daran, als du mich, [wistful], in deiner Werkstatt hast helfen lassen.

Character 2 [mix]: [hopeful] Well, the cathedral organ needs constant maintenance, [careful], und ich könnte eine Assistentin gebrauchen, wenn du jemals lernen möchtest.

Character 1 [mix]: [uncertain] I don't know, that's a lot to process, [struggling], nach all dieser Zeit, weißt du?

Character 2 [mix]: I understand completely. [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [warming] These apples are perfect for tomorrow's concert, [professional], und wir haben heute Morgen frische Birnen bekommen, die, [softer], wunderbar dazu passen würden.

Character 2 [mix]: [grateful] That's very kind of you to suggest, [touched], und vielleicht könnten wir, [hopeful], mehr reden während du mir hilfst sie auszuwählen?

Character 1 [mix]: [thoughtful] You know, dad always said that, [emotional], Vergebung wächst langsam wie gutes Obst am Baum.

Character 2 [mix]: [tearful] He was right about so many things, [regretful], und ich hätte mehr auf ihn hören sollen, besonders darüber, [voice breaking], was wirklich im Leben zählt. [choked up]

Character 1 [mix]: [decided] Tomorrow's concert starts at 7, [tentative], und vielleicht, wenn du möchtest, könnten wir danach Kaffee trinken und, [warming], wirklich über diese 15 Jahre sprechen. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [mix]: [relieved] I'd like that more than you know, [genuine], meine Tochter.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [stunned] Dad?

Character 2: I, um, didn't know you, [uncomfortable], worked here, and I mean, I just needed some, [swallowing], fruit for the church concert tomorrow, so, [trailing off], this is unexpected.

Character 1: [shaking] Well, I've been, um, working here for three years now, and, like, [hollow], this is the first time you've walked through those doors.

Character 2: [measured] The cathedral commissioned a new organ, [careful], and they moved me back to town six months ago, but I wasn't sure if, [hesitant], contacting you would be welcome.

Character 1: Six months and you never, [bitter], thought to pick up the phone or send a letter or anything?

Character 2: [quietly] Every day. [long pause]

Character 1: The produce section isn't exactly, [sardonic], where most family reunions happen, but here we are after, [voice breaking], fifteen years of nothing. [exhales]

Character 2: [gentle] I know, um, this isn't ideal, but seeing you here, [emotional], healthy and working, it's, well, it's more than I, [grateful], hoped for after everything that happened. [sighs heavily]

Character 1: You left when mom got sick and, [accusatory], never came back, not even for the funeral, not even to, [breaking], help me figure out what to do. [trembles]

Character 2: [remorseful] Building organs became my way of, [ashamed], hiding from grief, and by the time I realized what I'd, [pained], lost, it felt too late to come back.

Character 1: [softer] Um, you know, I still have that, like, little wooden pipe you carved for me, and, umm, [wavering], sometimes I hold it and remember when you used to, [wistful], let me help in your workshop.

Character 2: [hopeful] Well, I mean, the cathedral organ needs, um, [careful], constant maintenance, and I could use an assistant if you ever wanted to learn.

Character 1: [uncertain] I don't know, I mean, that's a lot to, umm, [struggling], process after all this time, you know?

Character 2: Um, I understand. [pause]

Character 1: [warming] These apples are perfect for tomorrow's concert reception, [professional], and we just got fresh pears this morning that would, [softer], pair beautifully with them.

Character 2: [grateful] Well, um, that's very kind of you to, like, [touched], suggest, and I mean, maybe we could, [hopeful], talk more while you help me select them?

Character 1: [thoughtful] You know, um, mom always said that, well, [emotional], forgiveness grows slowly like good fruit on the tree.

Character 2: [tearful] She was right about, um, so many things, and I mean, [regretful], I should have listened to her more, especially about, well, [voice breaking], what really mattered in life. [choked up]

Character 1: [decided] Tomorrow's concert starts at seven, and maybe, [tentative], if you wanted, we could get coffee after and, [warming], actually talk about those fifteen years. [exhales slowly]

Character 2: [relieved] I'd like that more than, um, [genuine], you could possibly know, son.
