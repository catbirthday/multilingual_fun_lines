=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I recognized that scar on your hand [trembling] when you were filling out the form, the one from when [voice breaking] we built that treehouse and you [quietly] cut yourself on dad's saw.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I, um, I don't know what you're, well, [shaking] I changed my name for a reason and, uh, [defensive] I never thought anyone from back then would find me here.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Mom cried for, um, three years straight after you left, and like, [choking up] dad never spoke your name again but I'd catch him, well, [broken] staring at your empty chair every dinner. [sobs quietly]

Character 2 [en]: They made their choice when they [bitter] said I was dead to them for loving who I loved, so I, um, [hollow] became someone else entirely and, well, [detached] built my life page by page like the books I bind. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] But I never, um, I mean I never said those things, I was just [anguished] seventeen and scared and didn't know how to, well, [regretful] stand up to them when they threw you out like that.

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] You didn't stop them. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [crying] I've been looking for you for twelve years, checking [desperate] every phone book and social media platform imaginable.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] The person you're looking for doesn't [coldly] exist anymore, can't you understand that?

Character 1 [en]: But you're sitting right here in [breaking] my massage room, and I can still see the way you [voice cracking] bite your lip when you're nervous just like when we were kids.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] Um, don't do this.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Well, I, uh, can't not.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] You have no idea what it cost me to [heavy] become someone dad couldn't destroy with his disappointment. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: Dad died two years [choked] ago calling out for you in his hospital bed, begging the [tearful] universe for one more chance to make things right with his child.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] He never, um, I mean he never even acknowledged I was, well, [crumbling] his child after that night, so why would he, uh, [confused] call for someone he said was dead? [voice breaks]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Because parents make terrible mistakes when [sad] they're afraid, and he spent his last years [remorseful] drowning in the weight of what he'd done.

Character 2 [en]: It doesn't change what happened or [angry] bring back the years I spent alone, wondering if I was [defeated] worth loving at all.

Character 1 [en]: I know it doesn't, but [soft] maybe we could start over from here. [hopeful pause]

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I've been coming here for, um, six months for my back pain, and you're telling me you knew, well, [incredulous] who I was this whole time and just, uh, [hurt] kept working on me like nothing had happened? [silence]

Character 1 [en]: [ashamed] I kept, um, trying to find the right moment but, well, [struggling] every week you'd leave and I'd hate myself a little more.

Character 2 [en]: [sinking] Maybe there was never going to be a [defeated] right moment for something this broken.
