=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confrontational] Um, I can't believe you're sitting there, [trembling], examining that patent when you know, well, it's literally my idea from, [bitter], our dorm room twenty years ago.

Character 2 [en]: You never filed anything back then and, [defensive], now TechGiant Corp has all the paperwork while you're just, [uncomfortable], standing here with memories and accusations.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] I mean, you were there when I sketched it out, um, remember those late nights when I explained, [desperate], every detail while you pretended to study for finals?

Character 2 [en]: [guarded] My job requires me to examine, [measured], what's in front of me, not what I, [shifting], might remember from college, regardless of how much it, [heavy], hurts to see this cross my desk. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] But you know the truth about who really, [voice cracking], invented this safety mechanism that could save thousands of kids.

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, there are protocols and, [quietly], legal requirements that I have to follow even when, [pained], my conscience is screaming at me to do, [trailing off], something else entirely.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Um, please, I mean... [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Your daughter's medical bills are why you never, [sympathetic], filed the patent yourself back then, and now she's healthy while this corporation, [disgusted], profits from your sacrifice.

Character 1 [en]: [broken] I, um, had to choose between protecting my idea and, [choking up], protecting my baby girl, and well, every parent knows there's really no, [tearful], choice there at all.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] Stop talking. [decisive]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] The way you're looking at those papers like you're, [hopeful], actually considering throwing away your career for this, like maybe, [breathless], integrity still matters to you after all these years.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, wait here. [hurried]

Character 1 [en]: [frantic] I mean, what are you doing because, um, if you reject their patent it won't, [worried], automatically give me the rights and they'll just, [defeated], file again with modifications anyway. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] There's prior art documentation I suddenly, [careful], remembered seeing from exactly twenty years ago that might interest you. [meaningful pause]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] You kept my sketches all these years even after we, [emotional], lost touch after graduation, I mean, why?

Character 2 [en]: [open] Well, um, because I knew this day would come when you'd, [honest], need proof, and I mean, real friends protect each other's dreams even across decades.

Character 1 [en]: After everything that happened between us with Sarah and the, [regretful], accusations and the way we ended things so badly.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Um, your invention could save lives and, well, that matters more than, [sincere], old wounds between former roommates.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] I, um, don't know what to, well... [crying]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] File your patent application today using these, [urgent], original sketches as evidence, because TechGiant's claim just became, [satisfied], invalid as of five minutes ago when I discovered this, [firm], critical oversight in their submission.
