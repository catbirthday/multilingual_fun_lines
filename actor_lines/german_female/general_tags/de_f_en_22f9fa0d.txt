Scenario: A luthier discovers that the vintage violin they've been restoring for months contains a hidden USB drive with encrypted files that may be connected to their recently deceased client's mysterious past.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] I found something, um, inside the violin that I think, [trembling], you need to see, something that, well, shouldn't be there and I mean, [quieter], it's making me question everything about Mrs. Chen. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: This USB drive has military-grade encryption that, [stunned], hasn't been used since 2017 and only three organizations in the world had access to this particular protocol.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, I don't know.

Character 2 [en]: [careful] The metadata shows these files were, [measured], last modified two days before she died, which means she was, [darker], actively working on something that required this level of security right up until, [trailing off], the accident.

Character 1 [en]: Um, she just seemed like a lonely old woman who, [breaking], wanted her grandmother's violin restored, I mean, we talked about music for hours, about Brahms, about her childhood in Vienna.

Character 2 [en]: [restrained] Well, I've seen this encryption signature before, um, in cases involving, [uncomfortable], international espionage, and I mean, the fact that she hid it inside an instrument suggests she knew, [grave], someone was watching her.

Character 1 [en]: [despairing] So, um, all those afternoons she spent in my workshop, well, watching me work while telling stories about her life, I mean, [hollow], none of that was real, was it, [defeated], she was just using me. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] People can be multiple things at once, um, and her appreciation for your craftsmanship seemed, [thoughtful], genuine even if she had, well, other motives for choosing you specifically, I mean, [softer], for trusting you with this. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Well, um, I spent three months bringing that violin back to life, you know, replacing the sound post, regraduating the top plate, and, [disgusted], now I find out it was just, I mean, [exhausted], a hiding place for whatever nightmare she was running from.

Character 2 [en]: [clinical] Um, there's something else you should know, well, the encryption key appears to be, [hesitant], tied to specific frequencies, and I think, [realization dawning], the violin itself might be the key, I mean, certain notes played in sequence.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] The Brahms sonata she kept, [disbelieving], humming while I worked, the one she said her grandmother played, [shaking], during the war to keep children calm in bomb shelters.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] That could be it, the frequency pattern from that, [focused], specific piece might unlock these files and reveal whatever she was, [tense], protecting or hiding.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] She left me a recording of herself playing it, said it was, [emotional], payment for the restoration work since her accounts were, [quieter], frozen after her death, but now I realize it was probably, [despairing], instructions.

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] We need to analyze that recording immediately because whoever else is, [worried], looking for these files won't stop just because she's, [grim], dead, and they might already know about, [fearful], you.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, there have been people asking questions at the shop lately, um, about her violin, about whether she left anything else behind, well, [disturbed], I thought they were just estate collectors.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Pack whatever you need because, um, we're moving you somewhere safe while I work on, [determined], cracking this. [decisive]

Character 1 [en]: The violin is still in my workshop, sitting on, [anguished], the bench where she used to watch me work, where we talked about, [broken], everything except what actually mattered.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] I'll send someone to retrieve it, um, discreetly, but I mean, right now we need to, [urgent], leave before they connect you to those files. [stands]

Character 1 [en]: This morning I was worried about matching the, [hollow], original varnish color and now I'm running from people who might, [terrified], kill me for restoring an old woman's violin, for doing my, [despairing], job.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I know.
