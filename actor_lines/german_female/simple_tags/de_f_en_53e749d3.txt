Scenario: An armorer who lost her military contract meets a packaging designer at a craft materials supplier, both searching for the same rare metallic finish that's been discontinued.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: They discontinued the Chromalux finish last week and now, [bitter], I have no way to complete the ceremonial armor set that was supposed to, [frustrated], save my reputation after losing the military contract, [defeated], you know what I mean. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I've been to every supplier in the state looking for something, [dissatisfied], even remotely similar for this luxury packaging project that's already three weeks behind schedule.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Nothing works anymore. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, um, I actually heard there might be, like, [disappointed], a warehouse downtown that still has, uh, some old stock but I mean, [regretful], they're probably just rumors at this point.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] God, I'm desperate enough.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] The thing is, um, even if we find it, I mean, [very sad], my client already thinks I'm incompetent because, well, I promised them something I can't deliver anymore, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Um, I spent twenty years perfecting my craft and now, [angry], I can't even source the materials I need, like, everything's just falling apart, you know? So, er, yeah.

Character 2 [en]: [tired] My entire portfolio was built around that specific, [melancholic], metallic finish and without it, everything looks cheap and ordinary. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: Uh, the worst part is that I actually, [crying while speaking], turned down other projects for this one commission, so, um, now I have nothing else lined up either. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] Maybe we should pool our resources and, [upset], split whatever we find because at this point, [desperate], we're both going to lose everything anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [bored] Even if we find it, the damage to our reputations is, [monotone], already done and clients don't forgive, [shaky voice], failures like this in our industries. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] You know, um, I used to love this work but, like, [passionately], now it just feels like I'm constantly failing at something that, well, [trailing off], used to come so naturally to me and I mean... [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] The armory community already thinks I'm washed up after, [jealous], seeing younger smiths get the contracts I used to win, [very melancholic], and this project was supposed to prove them all wrong.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Well, um, perhaps we should, [apologetic], accept that our industries have moved on without us, er, and we're just, uhh, relics of a different time. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You know what, um, at least I'm not the only one, like, [empathetically], drowning in this mess because, well, [speeding up], misery really does love company and, uhh, maybe that warehouse is worth checking out together.

Character 2 [en]: I mean, we've already lost so much that, um, [stern], what's one more wild goose chase at this point, [confused], though I can't imagine it'll lead anywhere good, [hopeless], given how everything else has gone lately. [sneeze]

Character 1 [en]: [sleepily] Fine, let's go chase ghosts in warehouses because, um, [resigned], apparently that's what our careers have come to now, like, searching for discontinued materials in, well, abandoned buildings.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Strange how we both ended up here at the exact same, [friendly], lowest point in our professional lives.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] M-maybe that's, um, not a coincidence but, [hollow], just how these things go, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, shall we, err, go then?
