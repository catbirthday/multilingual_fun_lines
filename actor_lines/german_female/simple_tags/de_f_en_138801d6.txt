=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Um, I wasn't expecting to see you here today, I mean, after all these years of, [anxious], not knowing where you even were or what happened.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I know this is, [shaky voice], probably the last thing you expected, but uh, I had to try to reach out somehow, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, uh, why now? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Er, because I've been watching from afar and, [regretful], seeing you in this position, well, it made me realize how much time we've wasted, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [very meekly] The palace guards don't even, [confused], know who you really are, do they, because if they did, [trailing off], they would never have let you through the gates like this.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] No, they think I'm just here to, [nervously], present some luxury goods to the royal household, which technically I am, but obviously that's not, [clearing throat], the real reason. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] I, um, I can't. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Look, I know this is, um, [overwhelmed], incredibly difficult and I'm not expecting you to just, [very quietly], forgive everything that happened between us, but maybe we could at least, well, try to talk? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] You disappeared for twelve years without a single word, [frustrated], and now you show up pretending to sell jewelry to my household staff. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] I understand your anger completely, and um, I know how this must, [sad], look from your perspective, but there were reasons I had to leave, er, reasons I couldn't explain then and, [slowly], maybe still can't fully explain now, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] B-but, um, why?

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] Because our father made it clear that, well, [upset], only one of us could have the life you're living now, and I, [passionately], couldn't be the reason you lost everything, so um, I chose to disappear instead.

Character 1 [en]: You're telling me that all this time, [crying while speaking], I thought you hated me for marrying into royalty, but really you were, [shocked], protecting me from having to choose between family and, [whispering loudly], this life I never even asked for?

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] I never hated you, not for a second, and um, [monotone], watching you from the shadows all these years, knowing you thought I abandoned you out of jealousy, well, [speeding up], it's been the hardest thing I've ever had to endure. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] All those nights I wondered if you were even still alive, [trembling], wondering what I did to make you leave. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] You didn't do anything wrong, ever, and I need you to, [gently], understand that completely before we go any further.

Character 1 [en]: The consort's life isn't what people think it is, you know, [melancholic], it's lonely and restrictive and I would have traded it all just to have, [very sincerely], my sibling back in my life.

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] Well, I'm here now, aren't I, and um, [hopeful], maybe it's not too late for us to find some way forward together, even if, er, it has to be in secret like this. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Um, I want to believe we can fix this, but there's so much hurt between us now, and, [exhausted], I don't know if I have the strength to bridge that gap, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Then let me be the one who does the work this time, because, um, [firmly], I've already lost twelve years with you and I won't, well, [loudly], I absolutely won't lose any more time if there's even the smallest chance we can be family again.
