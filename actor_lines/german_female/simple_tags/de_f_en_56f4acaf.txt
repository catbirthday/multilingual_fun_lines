=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [friendly] Well, um, I thought I'd stop by personally to, [hesitantly], discuss your situation since, I mean, [warm], we've been trying to reach you for weeks.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Listen, I just got home from my second job and my kids are, [anxious], waiting for dinner so whatever this is about—

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] Of course, I completely understand you're busy, but, [flattering], you've been such a model tenant for three years until recently, which is why, [condescending], I wanted to handle this personally. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Um, yeah, well, things have been, [frustrated], tough since my partner left and, I mean, [shaky voice], the daycare costs doubled and now, you know, [bitter], I'm working sixty hours a week just to keep food on the table. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: The building has strict policies about, [stern], payment schedules and we're already past the, [formal], grace period which puts me in a, [regretful], difficult position regarding your lease.

Character 2 [en]: Three months, [crying while speaking], I know. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Look, um, I run a business here and, well, [firmly], if I make exceptions for one tenant, I mean, [slowly], everyone expects the same treatment which simply isn't sustainable.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Um, sustainable? [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Well, I mean, sustainable. [short pause]

Character 2 [en]: [upset] You own forty buildings in this city and drive a car worth more than, [loudly], I make in five years.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] That's not really relevant to the current, [uncomfortable], situation we're discussing here, and frankly, [quickly], making this personal won't help resolve your outstanding balance.

Character 2 [en]: Um, personal? [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Well, I understand this is, um, [very quietly], emotional for you but, I mean, [clearing throat], we need to find a solution that works for both parties here. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] My eight-year-old asked me yesterday if we were going to be, [whispering], homeless like the family at her school.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Um, look, nobody's talking about, well, [hesitantly], immediate eviction here, alright?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] The notice on my door says I have seventy-two hours to, [monotone], pay in full or vacate, so what exactly are we, [sarcastic], talking about then? [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Standard procedure requires those notices but there are, [uncomfortable], payment plans we could explore if you can demonstrate, [trailing off], consistent income moving forward and maybe put down a, [nervous], partial payment now.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, partial like what? [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [calculating] Well, if you could, um, manage half of the outstanding balance, I mean, [reluctantly], immediately, we might be able to restructure the remaining debt.

Character 2 [en]: Half would be, um, four thousand five hundred dollars which, well, [defeated], might as well be, I mean, [very sad], four million because I have exactly, you know, [whispered], three hundred dollars until payday.
