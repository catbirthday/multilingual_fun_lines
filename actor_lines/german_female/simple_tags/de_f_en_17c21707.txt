=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I got the call about the Victorian restoration job and, [confused], didn't realize this was your address until I pulled up just now.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I specifically requested you because, [quietly], I remembered you always talked about wanting to work on, [bitter], authentic period homes and, er, this one needs someone who actually understands the craft.

Character 1 [en]: [awkwardly] So, um, are we just going to pretend that, well, the last five years didn't happen? [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] Um, well, yeah. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, er, I brought the William Morris samples you mentioned in the email and, [slowly], there's also this Arts and Crafts pattern that, well, might work better with the original moldings.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] The dining room needs to be finished before my mother visits next month.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Well, you know, that's barely three weeks for hand-printed paper installation and, um, the walls need serious prep work first.

Character 2 [en]: The previous contractor said it would only take, [dismissive], a week but then disappeared after seeing the plaster damage.

Character 1 [en]: [professionally] Um, I mean, authentic restoration isn't like slapping up vinyl from Home Depot—it requires, [firmly], proper moisture barriers and, well, careful pattern matching across every seam. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I wouldn't have called you if there were, well, any other qualified specialists in town who understood, er, Victorian authenticity.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, this is purely about my wallpaper skills and not about, [whispering], trying to fix things between us or, well, whatever this awkward energy is right now?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] There's nothing to fix because we already, [regretful], established five years ago that we wanted completely different things.

Character 1 [en]: [tired] Right, you wanted someone who'd give up their craft to follow your, [mocking], corporate ladder climbing ambitions. [short pause]

Character 2 [en]: And you wanted to spend forever working with your hands in, [condescending], old houses that would never pay the bills.

Character 1 [en]: [revealing] Well, um, funny thing is I actually own my business now with, [proudly], six employees and more Victorian restoration contracts than, er, I can handle.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You always said you'd never want the responsibility of managing people or dealing with business paperwork.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, turns out that, um, doing what you love makes even the boring parts worthwhile. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [melancholic] Meanwhile I'm living alone in this massive house that, [very quietly], echoes every footstep because I chose preservation over, [shaky voice], actual living. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Maybe that's why you called me.

Character 2 [en]: I mean, um, maybe I just needed to see if, well, the walls we put up between us were as permanent as, [trembling], the ones I'm trying to restore in this, er, empty house.
