Customer [en]: So um, I just saw my credit limit was... cut? Like, from ten thousand to basically... um, three?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, I'm—I'm really sorry to hear about that, let me just, uh, pull up your account here... okay so I'm seeing account number ACC-7739-BK21 and, um, yes I can see the—the adjustment that was made, I mean, er, the credit limit change on October 15th.

Customer [en]: October fifteenth. And nobody thought to, uh... tell me about this?

Customer Support [en]: I'm so—I'm really sorry about the, um, the communication issue there, that's definitely not—I mean we should have—let me check if there was supposed to be, uh, an email sent... okay so it shows notification ID NTF-882294 was, er, generated but I'm not seeing a delivery confirmation which is, um, concerning.

Customer [en]: So basically you're telling me that, um, your system just... didn't work. Great.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: Um, can you just, like, tell me WHY this happened? I've been a customer for, uh, twelve years, never missed a... wait no, thirteen years.

Customer Support [en]: Of course, um, let me—so I'm looking at the, uh, the review notes here and, er, it looks like there was an automated risk assessment on, um, September 30th, reference number REF-5521-QM, and it—well it flagged some, uh, some changes in your credit utilization patterns across, I mean, not just our card but...

Customer [en]: Changes in my... what changes? I use it the same way I always—

Customer Support [en]: So the—I'm sorry, let me just—the system is showing, um, increased utilization on external accounts, and, uh, there were three new credit inquiries in August which, er, triggered our review process under policy code POL-7782-A.

Customer [en]: Three inquiries because I was, um, refinancing my mortgage! That's not—do you know how much I spend with you people every year?

Customer Support [en]: I completely—I understand your frustration and, um, I can see you're one of our, uh, our valued customers with, er, let me see... lifetime spending of—oh wow, um, significant amount here in transaction history TXN-9982743 through TXN-9997856.

Customer [en]: Uh, so can you just... fix this then? Like, now?

Customer Support [en]: I wish I could just—um, I mean the system doesn't let me directly override but, er, what I can do is—let me submit an expedited review request, that's form FRM-3387-EX, and, uh, normally these take five to seven business days but I'm marking it as priority.

Customer [en]: Five to seven... I need my regular limit back, um, tomorrow. I have business expenses that—

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay.

Customer [en]: Look, just, uh... transfer me to someone who can actually, like, do something about this.

Customer Support [en]: I—I understand and, um, I can definitely escalate this to our, er, credit review specialists but, uh, they're going to need to do the same review process using case number CSE-4429-RV71, it's just that they have, um, slightly more options for temporary adjustments while the review is pending.

Customer [en]: Slightly more options. Um, fine, whatever, just... do that then.

Customer Support [en]: Of course, I'm, uh, initiating the transfer now and, er, I'm adding detailed notes to ticket TKT-8837-LP so they'll have all the—the context about your, um, your concerns and the refinancing situation, and I'm really sorry again about this whole...
