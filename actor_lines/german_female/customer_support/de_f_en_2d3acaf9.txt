=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So um, this is. Like. Embarrassing. But I need a refund?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, let me just pull that up for you, so basically I'll need to, uh, get your order number first if you have it? I mean, we can also search by email or, hmm, phone number if that's easier.

Customer [en]: I run a ticket office. I do refunds. All day. Can't fix mine though.

Customer Support [en]: [exhales] Oh wow, yeah that's, uh, that's actually kind of ironic isn't it? I mean, I totally get it though, like, our system is probably, um, completely different from yours. So what's the issue with the refund?

Customer [en]: It's like... what's the word... stuck? Processing. For three weeks.

Customer Support [en]: Three weeks? Okay so, um, that's definitely not normal, like at all. Let me, uh, let me look into this. Can you give me your confirmation number? Should be something like, hmm, REF and then some numbers?

Customer [en]: REF-4429. No wait. Um. REF-4492? The second one.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so REF-4492, and I'm, uh, pulling that up now... [inhales sharply] Oh. Yeah, I see what happened here. So basically your refund got, um, flagged in our fraud prevention system which is, like, honestly pretty ridiculous.

Customer [en]: Fraud? For what? Returning concert tickets? That I bought. Legitimately?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah no, I know, it's, um, it's honestly kind of embarrassing on our end? Like the system sometimes just, uh, randomly flags stuff when there's multiple tickets or, hmm, high value transactions, even though yours was only, let me see... TXN-73902-AK, that's $247.50.

Customer [en]: So like. What now. Do I just. Wait? Another three weeks?

Customer Support [en]: [exhales] Absolutely not, no. So, um, between you and me? This happens, like, way too often. I'm gonna, uh, manually override this right now, and basically push it through to, hmm, priority processing.

Customer [en]: You can do that? Just. Override it. That simple?

Customer Support [en]: I mean, yeah, I probably should've, um, checked with a supervisor first but, uh, honestly? You've waited long enough. Your new reference is gonna be, so, REF-4492-PRIORITY-X and that should, hmm, that should clear by tomorrow.

Customer [en]: Tomorrow? Not like... another eternity? You're sure?

Customer Support [en]: [soft exhale] Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm putting it through right now actually. Can you see your email? Because you should get, um, you should get confirmation in like, hmm, maybe two minutes? With tracking code TRK-95081-QM.

Customer [en]: Oh my god. Um. Yeah. It just. It came through. Already?

Customer Support [en]: Good, right? So that means it's, uh, it's definitely in the priority queue now. And, um, look, I know this whole thing has been, like, really frustrating, especially with your job and everything.

Customer [en]: This is. Embarrassing but. Like. Thank you? So much. Seriously.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, no problem at all, I mean, we all need help sometimes, right? Your refund reference REF-4492-PRIORITY-X should, um, should hit your account within 24 hours, but like, honestly? Usually it's faster, maybe, hmm, by tonight even.
