Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, absolutely, I can—so basically I'm here to help with that, uh, let me just pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted, okay?

Customer [en]: Okay okay. Um. This is—I've never done this? Before? So like...

Customer Support [en]: No no, hey, um, I totally get it—disputing charges is, uh, it's stressful, like especially the first time, so basically don't worry, we'll walk through this step by step together, alright?

Customer [en]: It's it's for gym equipment. Two hundred dollars. But I never—I never got anything.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, um, two hundred for equipment you didn't receive? That's—uh, that's really frustrating, so let me just, hmm, get your case number started here... okay so that's gonna be DSP-4429-BK71.

Customer [en]: Wait. Do I—will this mess up my credit? Or or my account?

Customer Support [en]: Um, no no no, so like, disputing won't hurt your credit at all, uh, and actually while we investigate—so that's usually about, um, five to seven days—we'll issue a temporary credit to your account with code TMP-8837-XC.

Customer [en]: Five days? But but rent is—um, it's due Monday.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, uh, oh gosh, okay so—let me just—actually you know what? I'm gonna, um, expedite this for you because rent, that's—that's critical, so basically I'm marking this as priority with reference PRY-2201-MK.

Customer [en]: You can? Really? Like for real?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah! Absolutely, so um, between you and me? When it's, uh, when it's affecting housing or food? We bump it up. Your expedited claim EXP-7734-QR should process by, hmm, Saturday latest.

Customer [en]: Okay. Okay okay. So so what—what happens now?

Customer Support [en]: Right, so, um, next steps—uh, basically I need to ask you, like, three quick questions about the charge, and then, er, we're pretty much done here, sound good?

Customer [en]: Um. Yeah. Yes. Go—go ahead.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so, uh, first—did you authorize any purchase from, hmm, let me see here... "FitGear Premium LLC" on October 3rd? Transaction ID is TXN-9948-KL22.

Customer [en]: No! No no no. Never heard of—I don't even. No.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, um, totally clear—and, uh, just to confirm, you haven't received any packages or, like, any shipping notifications from them, right?

Customer [en]: Nothing. I just—I just saw it. On my statement. Today.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, that's all I needed, uh, your dispute DSP-4429-BK71 is officially filed and, er, you should see that temporary credit within, like, twenty-four hours max—and hey, you did great for your first dispute!
