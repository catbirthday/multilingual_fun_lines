=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Oh thank god. I'm sorry. I think I... the website kept. Um. Crashing?

Customer Support [en]: No worries at all, so basically this has been happening all morning—our main server cluster went down around 9 AM. Let me pull up your account real quick, what's your email address?

Customer [en]: It's... I probably did something wrong. Maybe clicked too many times?

Customer Support [en]: Definitely not your fault, like, we've had over 300 reports since breakfast. So what I'm seeing here is your session ID SES-44219-BK got interrupted seventeen times—that's basically a record for today.

Customer [en]: Seventeen? Oh god. I'm sorry. I just kept... trying.

Customer Support [en]: Hey no no, that's exactly what you should do. So your account ACC-7263-MP shows you were trying to access your recent order, is that right?

Customer [en]: Yes. Kind of. I mean probably that's... I need to check if. The delivery?

Customer Support [en]: Got it, so I can see order ORD-9847-TL22 here, scheduled for tomorrow. But like, here's the thing—because of all these crashes, we're actually upgrading everyone affected to expedited shipping, no charge.

Customer [en]: Wait really? I don't. You don't have to. I mean I'm just...

Customer Support [en]: No listen, we're going to fix this properly. Your confirmation code is now EXP-7749-RK and basically that means guaranteed delivery by 10 AM tomorrow, and I'm adding a credit of $25 to your account.

Customer [en]: That's... I think that's too much? Maybe just. The website working is enough.

Customer Support [en]: Look, you tried seventeen times to get through, so like, that's persistence we need to reward. Reference number for the credit is CRD-2024-8837-A.

Customer [en]: I'm being silly. Probably everyone's calling. Sort of taking your time.

Customer Support [en]: You're literally my favorite call today because you're so nice about it. So basically while I have you, let me check if there's anything else affected on account ACC-7263-MP... yeah, your wishlist is intact, payment methods are all good.

Customer [en]: Oh. Thank god. I thought maybe I... lost everything?

Customer Support [en]: Nope, everything's safe, so like all your data is backed up every hour. Your last successful save was at 8:47 AM, reference timestamp TS-084747-EST.

Customer [en]: I just. Really needed this order. Kind of important. Sorry.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, no apologizing, that's why we're fixing it. So I'm putting a priority flag PRI-HIGH-7263 on your account, basically means if you have ANY issues tomorrow with delivery, you call and ask for me directly—name's Jordan, employee ID EMP-4472.

Customer [en]: That's so. I mean. Thank you? I think I'm just. Relieved.

Customer Support [en]: Totally understand, like this morning was rough for everyone. So your updated tracking number is TRK-9847-EXPR-22 and basically you'll get texts every step of the way. We're going to make sure this gets to you perfectly, okay?
