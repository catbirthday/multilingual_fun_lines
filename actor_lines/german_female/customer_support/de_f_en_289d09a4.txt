Scenario: asking about loyalty program terms and conditions

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I just, uh, signed up for your loyalty thing and, er, I'm trying to understand the terms?

Customer Support [en]: Oh yeah, the—let me just—okay so the VIP Rewards program, member ID VRP-8847-QN, and honestly? The terms are a bit—I mean, they're ridiculous, even I think so.

Customer [en]: Right, um, so like, what happens with my points if I, uh, don't use them?

Customer Support [en]: So they expire—wait no, sorry—they used to expire after 6 months but now it's—let me check—code POL-2024-EXP shows 12 months, which is still kinda short if you ask me.

Customer [en]: Um, okay, that's, er, better than I thought, but uh, what about returns?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, this is where it gets—I mean, honestly annoying—if you return something, um, the points get deducted from account PTS-BALANCE-01, and uh, if you already used them? They charge you.

Customer [en]: They charge me? Um, that seems, uh, I mean next time I'll just, er, not bother with points then.

Customer Support [en]: Right? It's—look, between us—total nonsense. The system ref TRM-SECTION-7B makes it so complicated when it should just be simple.

Customer [en]: Well, um, at least you're being honest about it, uh, I appreciate that.

Customer Support [en]: So here's what I—actually wait—let me tell you the workaround, um, if you use code SAVE-POINTS-90 when redeeming, uh, it protects them for returns, but they don't advertise this.

Customer [en]: Um, really? That's, uh, actually helpful, er, thanks for telling me.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah the whole—I mean—document DOC-LOYALTY-2024 is 47 pages long, who reads that? So um, anything else that's, uh, confusing you about it?

Customer [en]: Er, what about, um, the birthday rewards thing, uh, how does that work exactly?

Customer Support [en]: Oh that's actually—wait, let me—yeah so code BDAY-BONUS-200 gives double points, but here's the dumb part, you gotta activate it yourself, it's not automatic.

Customer [en]: Um, of course it's not automatic, uh, why would anything just, er, work simply?

Customer Support [en]: I know—it's like—we have your birthdate in file DOB-FIELD-ACTIVE, the system knows, but no, you still gotta manually click the button, it's so backwards.

Customer [en]: Well, um, at least now I know, uh, better than finding out after missing it.

Customer Support [en]: Exactly, and um, while we're at it—the tier system? Code TIER-SILVER-500, uh, you need 500 points for Silver but they don't—I mean, the benefits are barely different from basic.

Customer [en]: Um, good to know, er, I'll just, uh, not stress about reaching tiers then.

Customer Support [en]: Smart move, honestly just, um, use the points for discounts—code DISC-APPLY-10—and uh, don't overthink the rest, that's what I tell everyone who actually listens.
