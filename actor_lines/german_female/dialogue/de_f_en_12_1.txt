Character 1 [en]: Is it true that octopuses have three hearts?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, actually, they do! Um, it's pretty fascinating when you think about it - two pump blood to the gills and, you know, one handles circulation for the rest of the body.

Character 1 [en]: Why would they need three?

Character 2 [en]: Well, it's basically about oxygen efficiency underwater, I mean, octopus blood uses copper instead of iron to carry oxygen, so, uh, it's less efficient and they need that extra pumping power.

Character 1 [en]: Copper blood? That sounds made up.

Character 2 [en]: No no, I swear! It's called hemocyanin instead of hemoglobin, and, er, get this - it actually makes their blood blue when oxygenated, like, seriously blue, not the myth about human veins.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, so, um, are you telling me that, well, octopuses are basically aliens?

Character 2 [en]: Haha, you know, some scientists actually, uh, joke about that because they're so weird - they can edit their own RNA, sort of, rewrite their genetic instructions on the fly!

Character 1 [en]: That's honestly, um, kind of [upset] terrifying. What else can they, like, do?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, where do I even start? They can, hmm, taste with their suckers, squeeze through any opening bigger than their beak, and, actually, some species can walk on land for short periods.

Character 1 [en]: Hold up. Did you just, er, say they can walk on land? That's, I mean, that's not right.

Character 2 [en]: I'm totally serious! The algae octopus in Australia, well, it literally walks between tide pools, and I know it sounds [frustrated] insane but, you know, there's video evidence and everything.

Character 1 [en]: So they're basically, um, shape-shifting, land-walking, RNA-editing, copper-blooded, like, super creatures?

Character 2 [en]: Pretty much! And here's the thing, they only live like one or two years usually, which is [confused] bizarre considering how intelligent they are - they can solve puzzles, use tools, basically, even recognize individual humans.

Character 1 [en]: One or two [very loudly] YEARS? That's IT?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, it's [very melancholic] heartbreaking when you think about it - all that intelligence, problem-solving ability, basically consciousness maybe, and most species just get a year or two to experience existence.

Character 1 [en]: What kills them so young?

Character 2 [en]: It's actually programmed death after reproduction, kind of, the males die right after mating and females, well, they starve themselves while guarding eggs until they hatch.

Character 1 [en]: That's the most [loudly] depressing thing I've heard today.

Character 2 [en]: I know, right? But here's the thing, um, there's one deep-sea species that lives way longer, like seven years, so, you know, maybe evolution's working on fixing that design flaw.
