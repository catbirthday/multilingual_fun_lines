Character 1 [en]: Have you ever tried A/B testing your landing pages?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, um, we actually run tests constantly now. The thing is, most people test the wrong elements first - they'll change button colors when, you know, the real issue is their value proposition isn't clear.

Character 1 [en]: What should they test first then?

Character 2 [en]: Headlines, without question. I mean, your headline determines whether people even read further, so, we typically see 20-30% lifts just from, er, testing different headline angles and messaging.

Character 1 [en]: But, like, how do you know when you have, um, enough data to, actually, make a decision?

Character 2 [en]: Well, statistical significance is crucial - you need, hmm, at least 95% confidence usually. Most tools calculate this automatically now, but honestly, you also need to consider practical significance, like whether a 2% lift is worth implementing.

Character 1 [en]: So, wait, you're saying that, uh, even if something wins, you know, statistically, it might not be, I guess, worth doing?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly! Implementation costs matter, and, er, here's the thing - small wins can add up, but sometimes you're better off, basically, focusing on bigger swing tests rather than micro-optimizations.

Character 1 [en]: What's considered a big swing test?

Character 2 [en]: Complete value proposition changes, like, pricing model shifts, or, well, totally different user flows. We once increased conversions 47% by, actually, adding MORE steps to our signup process because it reduced anxiety.

Character 1 [en]: Adding steps increased conversions? That goes against everything I've read.

Character 2 [en]: I know it sounds counterintuitive, but, um, we were asking for credit card info too early. Breaking it into smaller steps with, you know, progress indicators made people more comfortable, so, completion rates shot up.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, what about, like, social proof? Does that, er, actually work or is it, basically, just marketing fluff?

Character 2 [en]: Social proof is incredibly powerful when done right - testimonials, um, case studies, real numbers all [cry loudly] work, but generic stuff like "trusted by thousands" is, honestly, pretty useless these days.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, how do you, well, test mobile versus desktop? They're so, uh, different that it's, kind of, comparing apples to oranges.

Character 2 [en]: You absolutely have to segment them separately, I mean, mobile users behave completely differently. We run, er, parallel tests with different hypotheses because what works on desktop often, you know, fails miserably on mobile.

Character 1 [en]: What's the biggest mistake you see people make?

Character 2 [en]: Testing without a hypothesis! People just randomly [high-pitched] change things hoping something sticks instead of having a clear theory about why a change should improve conversions.

Character 1 [en]: That's [very sad] depressing but probably true for most companies.

Character 2 [en]: Unfortunately yeah, but, well, the good news is once you start thinking systematically about it, like, the improvements compound. Every test teaches you something about your users, so, even failures become valuable data points.
