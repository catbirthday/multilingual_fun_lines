Character 1 [en]: So, um, have you ever done that thing where you, [high-pitched], like, pretend to be a local in, you know, a tourist spot?

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, actually, yes! I once spent, hmm, an entire afternoon in Times Square pretending I knew where everything was, basically, giving completely made-up directions to other tourists.

Character 1 [en]: That's evil! I love it!

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, everyone seemed so, well, grateful for any help, and I mean, most of them probably ended up somewhere interesting anyway, right?

Character 1 [en]: Wait wait wait, so you were just, er, sending people on, like, random adventures through Manhattan? That's, honestly, kind of brilliant!

Character 2 [en]: Look, I figured, you know, getting lost is half the fun of traveling anyway, and, uhh, they wanted authentic New York experiences, so really, I was helping!

Character 1 [en]: Did anyone ever come back and yell at you?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, one couple came back, but here's the thing, they were thrilled because they'd, um, stumbled onto this amazing hole-in-the-wall dumpling place, so they thanked me!

Character 1 [en]: No way! That's— okay so, that's literally, I mean, the best possible outcome, err, from giving fake directions!

Character 2 [en]: Right? Sometimes the universe just [sleepily] works out that way, though I did feel slightly guilty when this sweet elderly couple asked about the subway.

Character 1 [en]: Oh no, what did you tell them?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I basically just pointed them toward, you know, the nearest entrance and said "good luck," which, honestly, isn't that different from what actual New Yorkers do.

Character 1 [en]: True! Nobody really knows how the subway works anyway!

Character 2 [en]: The best part is, um, when actual locals started joining in, like, they'd overhear me giving these ridiculous directions and, anyway, just play along completely straight-faced.

Character 1 [en]: This is why I [confidently] always use my phone for directions now!

Character 2 [en]: Smart move, though honestly, half the adventure stories I have are from, well, getting completely lost and, er, ending up in the weirdest places imaginable.

Character 1 [en]: Like that time you, uhh, ended up at that wedding in, I guess, Prague? Was it, actually, Prague?

Character 2 [en]: Budapest! And yes, somehow I went from, you know, looking for a bathroom to being handed champagne and, basically, dancing with someone's grandmother for, um, two hours straight.

Character 1 [en]: How do you even— I mean, like, how does that happen? Were you just, err, too polite to leave or, honestly, what?

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, once you're holding the champagne and, well, the grandmother has your arm, you're basically committed, and anyway, Hungarian weddings are, actually, incredibly fun!
