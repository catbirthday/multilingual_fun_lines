Character 1 [en]: How do you simplify [cheerful] stakeholder theory for executive teams?

Character 2 [en]: I focus on Freeman's core principle - businesses exist [exhausted] to serve all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Strip away academic jargon: employees, customers, suppliers, communities all have legitimate claims on corporate resources and decision-making processes.

Character 1 [en]: What about Friedman's shareholder primacy doctrine?

Character 2 [en]: Friedman's model is elegant but [groan] outdated for modern corporations. Profit maximization within legal bounds ignores externalities, reputational capital, and long-term sustainability - companies pursuing pure shareholder value often destroy themselves through short-termism.

Character 1 [en]: How do you quantify ethical decisions?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I use three frameworks, um, simplified into metrics: utilitarian calculus becomes [passionately] cost-benefit with social impact weighting, you know, deontological rules translate to compliance scorecards, and virtue ethics, er, maps to corporate culture assessments.

Character 1 [en]: Can AI handle ethical auditing?

Character 2 [en]: AI excels at pattern recognition in compliance data but lacks contextual judgment for gray areas. Machine learning can flag anomalies in expense reports or procurement patterns, but human oversight remains critical for interpreting intent and cultural nuances.

Character 1 [en]: So, what about, uhh, whistleblower protections, I mean, in practice?

Character 2 [en]: Look, Sarbanes-Oxley mandates, hmm, anonymous reporting channels, but, the thing is, actual protection varies widely. Studies show 70% of whistleblowers face retaliation despite legal safeguards - culture trumps policy every time in organizational behavior.

Character 1 [en]: How do you implement ethical supply chain monitoring?

Character 2 [en]: Blockchain provides immutable audit trails, uh, but adoption requires [shaky voice] significant infrastructure investment, you know. Most companies rely on third-party auditors like Bureau Veritas or SGS, though self-reporting and corruption, well, remain persistent challenges in developing markets.

Character 1 [en]: Does ESG investing [mumbling] actually drive ethical behavior?

Character 2 [en]: ESG metrics create accountability [monotone] but suffer from standardization problems across rating agencies. BlackRock's $10 trillion influence forces compliance, yet greenwashing persists because current frameworks prioritize disclosure over actual impact measurement.

Character 1 [en]: How do you, err, handle [cry] conflicts of interest, honestly, in board governance?

Character 2 [en]: Recusal protocols and independent directors provide structural safeguards, but social dynamics often override formal processes. Research shows 43% of board decisions involve undisclosed personal relationships - transparency requirements only work when enforced through regular audits.

Character 1 [en]: What's your take on corporate political contributions?

Character 2 [en]: Citizens United legalized unlimited spending, but, um, shareholders deserve transparency about political activities, basically. Companies face backlash when contributions contradict stated values - Disney and Georgia's voting law exemplifies how political engagement creates stakeholder conflicts.

Character 1 [en]: Can ethical cultures, like, [whispering] survive mergers and acquisitions?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, 70% of M&A failures stem from, well, cultural misalignment, not financial issues, you see. Due diligence must assess ethical frameworks beyond compliance - Wells Fargo's sales scandal originated from acquired Norwest's aggressive culture overwhelming their conservative banking ethics.
