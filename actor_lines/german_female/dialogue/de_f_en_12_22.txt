Character 1 [en]: So, um, I was thinking, you know, maybe we could adjust the blocking for scene three, er, just slightly?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely not. The blocking was finalized three weeks ago after extensive rehearsal, and changing it now would throw off the entire rhythm of the act.

Character 1 [en]: But the actors are [cough] struggling with the current positions and sight lines.

Character 2 [en]: The actors need to, well, adapt to the direction as given, honestly, not the other way around. This production has a very specific vision that I've been crafting for months, and, actually, every movement has been choreographed with purpose.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, couldn't we at least, uh, consider some minor tweaks, like, for safety reasons?

Character 2 [en]: Safety is one thing, but what you're suggesting, err, isn't about safety, it's about comfort, you know, and great theater doesn't come from comfort. The tension in their movements, actually, translates to authentic tension on stage.

Character 1 [en]: What about the lighting cues in act two? They're running late every night.

Character 2 [en]: The lighting cues are precisely timed to the second, and if the technical crew can't execute them properly, then we need a new technical crew, not new cues.

Character 1 [en]: You're [laugh] joking, right? I mean, we can't just, um, replace the entire crew, honestly, two days before opening!

Character 2 [en]: Watch me. I've fired crews the morning of opening night before, and the show went on magnificently because the replacements understood the importance of precision.

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, what about the costumes, er, because the lead actress says, well, she literally can't breathe in hers?

Character 2 [en]: The corset is historically accurate to the eighteen-eighties period, and, hmm, if she can't breathe, actually, she needs to work on her breathing technique, you know, not blame the costume.

Character 1 [en]: This is, uh, [cough] getting ridiculous, like, we need to think about, actually, the performers' wellbeing here!

Character 2 [en]: The performers signed contracts agreeing to my directorial vision, and that vision doesn't bend to accommodate every little complaint or discomfort they might have.

Character 1 [en]: I can't [laugh hard] believe you're being this inflexible about everything!

Character 2 [en]: It's not inflexibility, it's artistic integrity, and without it, we'd have nothing but mediocre community theater instead of the groundbreaking production this is meant to be.

Character 1 [en]: Well, the thing is, um, the producer is concerned about, you know, all these complaints from the cast, actually.

Character 2 [en]: The producer hired me specifically because I deliver exceptional results through uncompromising standards, and if they want a different approach, they should have hired a different director.

Character 1 [en]: So basically, you're saying it's your way or, err, nothing at all, honestly, no room for any collaboration here?

Character 2 [en]: Collaboration happened during the planning phase three months ago, but now we're in execution mode, and yes, it's my way because that's what creates theatrical excellence, not committee decisions.
