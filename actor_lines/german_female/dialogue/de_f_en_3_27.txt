Character 1 [en]: The new policy rollout starts Monday. Everyone needs to follow it exactly as written.

Character 2 [en]: [cough] I read through the whole document, and there are some scenarios it doesn't really address. What happens when clients request expedited processing that conflicts with the new approval chains? We handle about thirty of those requests per week.

Character 1 [en]: [bored] Just follow the policy. It's not complicated.

Character 2 [en]: But it is complicated when you're dealing with real-world situations. Yesterday alone, I had a client whose entire production line was waiting on our approval, and the new policy would have added six hours to their downtime.

Character 1 [en]: Six hours isn't that long.

Character 2 [en]: Six hours of production stoppage costs them roughly forty thousand dollars. That's not insignificant, and they're one of our biggest accounts—we can't just tell them to wait because our internal process changed.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Upper management signed off on this. We don't have a choice.

Character 2 [en]: We always have choices about implementation. I'm not saying we ignore the policy, but we need contingency plans for time-sensitive situations that the policy writers clearly didn't consider.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] I—I don't think we're authorized to make those kinds of adjustments.

Character 2 [en]: Then who is? Because I guarantee you, when Miller Industries calls next week with an emergency request and we tell them to wait six hours, they'll escalate directly to the CEO.

Character 1 [en]: The CEO approved this policy.

Character 2 [en]: The CEO approved the concept. I doubt she reviewed the operational details or understood how it impacts our tier-one clients' just-in-time manufacturing schedules.

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] This is exactly why policies fail! Everyone thinks they're the exception!

Character 2 [en]: I'm not saying we're the exception. I'm saying the policy has gaps that need addressing before Monday, or we're going to lose clients who've been with us for fifteen years.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Right, because you know better than the entire policy committee.

Character 2 [en]: I know our clients better than the policy committee does, yes. I've managed these accounts for eight years, and I can tell you exactly which ones will jump ship if we can't accommodate their operational requirements.

Character 1 [en]: Then they weren't good clients anyway.

Character 2 [en]: Miller Industries generates twelve million in annual revenue. Hartley Group brings in another eight million. These aren't just "good clients"—they're the foundation of our entire eastern region operations.

Character 1 [en]: Revenue isn't everything.

Character 2 [en]: No, but it pays everyone's salaries. Look, all I'm asking is that we build in emergency protocols for our top-tier accounts before this goes live, otherwise Monday's going to be a disaster.
