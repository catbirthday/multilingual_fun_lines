Character 1 [en]: How long have you been approving overtime requests without actually checking if the work gets done?

Character 2 [en]: Oh well, I've been doing this for, [very melancholic], eleven years now, and honestly, I just trust people; if someone says they need the hours, who am I to question their judgment about their own workload, you know?

Character 1 [en]: So, basically you're saying, um, anyone can claim overtime and you'll, kind of, just sign off on it?

Character 2 [en]: I mean, yeah—err, that's essentially how it works; people need money, they have families to feed, and actually, the company makes billions, so what's a few extra hours here and there between humans trying to survive?

Character 1 [en]: The auditors are, uhh, coming next week—like, have you prepared any documentation, or really, any justification for these approvals?

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, documentation is such a strong word—anyway, I have some sticky notes, you know, and I remember most conversations; the auditors usually just want to see that someone signed something, so we'll figure it out together.

Character 1 [en]: You realize, I guess, that this could—well, this could actually cost you your job, right?

Character 2 [en]: Sure, but here's my philosophy: we spend more time documenting work than doing work; I'd rather err on the side of trusting my team and letting them live their lives than become another corporate enforcer.

Character 1 [en]: Yesterday Marcus claimed thirty hours of overtime in a single week. That's physically impossible.

Character 2 [en]: Okay so, Marcus has three kids—honestly, his wife just lost her job, and um, sometimes the numbers don't matter as much as, I mean, helping someone through a rough patch.

Character 1 [en]: But that's—uhh, that's fraud, [slurring], technically speaking, and like, you're basically an accomplice at this point.

Character 2 [en]: Fraud feels like such a harsh word when we're talking about a dad trying to keep his house; look, the company writes off millions in "business lunches" every quarter, so this barely registers.

Character 1 [en]: Here's the thing, your team's productivity is, er, forty percent below target—I guess, doesn't that concern you at all, really?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely. You want to know what concerns me more though? That Jenny's diabetic son gets his insulin, that Tom can afford his mom's nursing home, that people can sleep at night without worrying about money.

Character 1 [en]: How do you, sort of, justify this to upper management when they, you know, inevitably ask questions?

Character 2 [en]: I use a lot of corporate buzzwords like "investing in human capital" and "maintaining team cohesion during transitional periods"; they eat that stuff up, never actually dig deeper into what it means.

Character 1 [en]: Don't you worry that [trailing off] eventually someone will notice the patterns and...

Character 2 [en]: Of course I worry, but I've been doing this for over a decade and we're still here; my teams have the lowest turnover in the company, highest satisfaction scores, and somehow we always make our annual targets.

Character 1 [en]: What happens when, hmm, I report this conversation—like, what's your plan then, actually?

Character 2 [en]: Report away, honestly—I'm betting you won't though, because deep down you know I'm right; this job strips away enough humanity already, and I refuse to let it take what little compassion we have left in this place.
