Speaker [en]: [gasp softly] I'm doing it. I'm actually—oh my God, [extremely happy] look at my feet! They're moving, like, they're really moving! [crying while speaking] The doctors said—they literally sat there and told me I'd never... [pause] And here I am, you know? 

[laugh] Three steps. That's three whole steps! I mean, honestly, my legs feel like jello, but who cares? [shaky voice] Remember when Dr. Morrison said the nerve damage was permanent? That I should, um, "adjust my expectations"? Well, [bitter] where's he now, right? 

[very excited] Can you see this? Are you watching? Because I need—I need someone to witness this! [gasp loudly] Wait, I'm gonna try again. Here, just... [hesitantly] okay, my left leg is kind of wobbly, but it's—[relieved] it's holding me up! 

[cry] I thought I'd accepted it, you know? The wheelchair, the whole thing. But somehow I just... I don't know, I kept doing those exercises you showed me. [warm] Every single day, even when it seemed pointless. And now—[laugh loudly] now I'm walking! Actually walking! [whispering] Thank you. For not giving up on me when literally everyone else did.
