Speaker [en]: [gasp loudly] Oh my God, that was—that kid almost got crushed by those carts! [shaky voice] I saw it happening in slow motion, you know? The whole line of them rolling straight toward him and I just froze, I couldn't even—my voice wouldn't work. [relieved] But that attendant, he just dove, literally dove across and grabbed the kid, pulled him out of the way like, um, like half a second before impact. 

[pause]

The mom didn't even see it happening, she was looking at her phone and then suddenly her kid's in this guy's arms and there's twenty metal carts crashed into the wall where he was standing. [very sincerely] I mean, that would've been... God, I don't even want to think about it. [grateful] That attendant saved that little boy's life, no question. Like, he didn't hesitate for even a second, just pure instinct. 

[emotional] And the way he just handed the kid back to his mom afterward, all casual, like it was nothing? [laugh] He's probably making minimum wage and he just... [trailing off] I should've gotten his name. Actually, I'm going to find a manager right now and make sure they know what he did. [determined] That's a hero working in their parking lot.
