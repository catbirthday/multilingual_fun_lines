I mean, honestly, my legs feel like jello, but who cares? [shaky voice] Remember when Dr. Morrison said the nerve damage was permanent? That I should, um, \"adjust my expectations\"? Well, [bitter] where's he now, right? \n\n[very excited] Can you see this? Are you watching? Because I need—I need someone to witness this! [gasp loudly] Wait, I'm gonna try again. Here, just... [hesitantly] okay, my left leg is kind of wobbly, but it's—[relieved] it's holding me up! \n\n[cry] I thought I'd accepted it, you know? The wheelchair, the whole thing. But somehow I just... I don't know, I kept doing those exercises you showed me. [warm] Every single day, even when it seemed pointless. And now—[laugh loudly] now I'm walking! Actually walking! [whispering] Thank you.
