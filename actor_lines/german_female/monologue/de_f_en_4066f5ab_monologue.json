[sarcastic] Grateful? To a man who made me feel invisible my entire childhood? [laughing] God, this is so messed up. \n\n[quietly] Mom says he was proud of me. [frustrated] Well, where was that pride when I graduated? Where was it when I needed—[trailing off] whatever. [sigh] \n\nThe lawyer keeps calling it a \"generous bequest.\" [mocking] Generous. Right. Like money fixes everything. [pause] Though honestly, it does fix the student loans. And the medical bills. And—[hesitantly] shit, am I actually considering this?\n\n[very sad] You know what the worst part is? Um, I would've traded every penny just to hear him say he cared. Once.
