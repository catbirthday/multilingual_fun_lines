The meter starts going crazy, like, beeping nonstop. [gasp] Natural gas. High concentration. Right by the main line where it feeds into the building.\n\nI mean, we're talking about... [shaky voice] three hundred people work in that building. Three hundred. If someone had lit a cigarette, or if the heating had kicked on wrong, or—actually, I can't even think about it. [pause] The whole northeast corner could've gone up. \n\n[relieved] But we caught it. That's what matters, right? Twenty minutes earlier and we would've missed it completely. Twenty minutes later and, well... [trailing off]\n\nThe thing is, um, people always complain about these inspections. [frustrated] \"Why do you need access again? We just did this last month.\" But this is exactly why. [passionately] This is literally why we do what we do! One tiny crack in a fitting that's probably been slowly leaking for weeks. \n\n[warm] Marcus is getting a commendation, obviously. Hell, we all should. [chuckle] We actually saved lives today."
