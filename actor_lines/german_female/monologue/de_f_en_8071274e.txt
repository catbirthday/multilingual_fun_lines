Subject: Your bindery worker efficiency improvements just earned your whole team a bonus

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [extremely happy] Oh my God, I can't believe it actually worked! [laugh] They just announced it—the whole team's getting a bonus because of the efficiency improvements. [very quietly] I mean, I knew the numbers were good, but... wow. [pause] You know, when I first suggested reorganizing the collating stations, everyone thought I was, um, kind of crazy. [chuckle] "Why fix what isn't broken," they said. [passionate] But I could see it, you know? All those extra steps people were taking, the way materials were getting bottlenecked at the trimmer. [excited] And now look—thirty percent faster throughput! [gasp softly] That's not just numbers on a spreadsheet anymore, that's real money for everyone. [warm] Sarah was actually crying when she heard. She's been saving for her kid's braces and this is gonna, uh... this is really gonna help her. [sniffle] God, I worked so many late nights on those workflow charts. [relieved] All those spreadsheets, timing every single process with a stopwatch like some kind of, I don't know, efficiency detective or something. [laugh loudly] But it paid off! [very sincerely] The best part isn't even my bonus—it's seeing everyone so happy. [trailing off] Though I'm definitely not complaining about the extra money either...
