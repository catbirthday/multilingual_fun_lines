=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] So the whole thing collapsed. [pause] Everything I said would happen, happened. [frustrated] They spent, what, three months completely overhauling the system because apparently the way we'd done it for twenty years was "outdated" and "inefficient." [sarcastic] Yeah, well, look how efficient they are now with nothing working. 

[angry] I tried to tell them—I mean, I wasn't being stubborn just to be stubborn, you know? [passionately] There were reasons we did things the way we did. [quietly] But no, I was the dinosaur who couldn't adapt. [mocking] "You have to embrace change, Margaret. Innovation is key." [laugh] Innovation. 

[sigh] The thing is, I don't... I don't even feel good about being right. [sad] Well, maybe a little, but mostly I'm just—ugh, it's such a waste. [speeding up] All that time, all that money, and now we're scrambling to put the old system back in place except, oh wait, they already deleted half the infrastructure. [groan]

[hesitantly] I guess what bothers me most is that they never actually, um... they never asked why we did things that way. [warming] They just assumed it was because we didn't know better. [confidently] Sometimes the old way is the old way because it works. [trailing off] Sometimes tradition exists for a... [pause] [very quietly] I just wish they'd listened.
