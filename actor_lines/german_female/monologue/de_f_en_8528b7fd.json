[anxious] Maybe I was just wasting everyone's time with, um, with committees and proposals and all those endless phone calls to companies who wouldn't even return them. [frustrated] God, the rejection letters. [laugh] I wallpapered my office with them at one point, just to—I don't know, spite myself into working harder? [warm] But then that first company said yes. [very excited] Just a small manufacturing outfit, twenty jobs, but it was something! [speeding up] And then another one came, and the tax incentives actually worked, and suddenly everyone who called me naive was asking how they could help. [crying while speaking] My dad would've been so proud. [sniffle] He worked at the old plant for thirty years before it closed. [very sincerely] This town raised me, you know? [passionately] It deserved someone who'd fight for it. [happy] And now kids can actually stay here after high school, build lives here. [very quietly] We did it. We actually did it."
