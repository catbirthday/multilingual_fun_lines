Subject: Finding out your boom operator union is being dissolved and your pension fund was embezzled by leadership

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [confused] Wait, what do you mean dissolved? [pause] Ich verstehe das nicht—warte mal, ich lese diese E-Mail nochmal. [anxious] They're saying the union is... gone? [very quietly] Einfach so? 23 Jahre lang hab ich Beiträge gezahlt, und die sind einfach— [furious] Are you fucking kidding me?! [shaky voice] Der Pensionsfonds wurde was? [pause] Unterschlagen. [bitter] Oh, that's perfect. Das ist einfach... [sigh] Ich kann das gerade echt nicht verarbeiten. [angry] Jerry Thompson took our money? Derselbe Jerry, der diese Rede gehalten hat über, ähm, über Solidarität und füreinander da sein? [sarcastic] Real nice solidarity, Jerry. [upset] I was counting on that pension, you know? Also, das war mein ganzer— [trailing off] Ich weiß nicht, was ich jetzt machen soll. [very sad] Forty-eight years old and I'm basically starting from scratch. All diese Jahre mit, äh... mit frühem Aufstehen am Set, diesen Boom-Pole halten bis meine Arme taub wurden, mit Regisseuren klarkommen, die— [groan] Gott, was sag ich bloß Sarah? [crying while speaking] We just put a down payment on the house, weil wir dachten, wir hätten diese Sicherheit. [exhausted] I feel like such an idiot for trusting them.

Speaker: [confused] Wait, what do you mean dissolved? [pause] I don't—hold on, I'm reading this email again. [anxious] They're saying the union is... gone? [very quietly] Just like that? Twenty-three years I've been paying dues, and they're just— [furious] Are you fucking kidding me?! [shaky voice] The pension fund was what? [pause] Embezzled. [bitter] Oh, that's perfect. That's just... [sigh] I can't even process this right now. [angry] Jerry Thompson took our money? The same Jerry who gave that speech about, um, about solidarity and looking out for each other? [sarcastic] Real nice solidarity, Jerry. [upset] I was counting on that pension, you know? Like, that was my whole— [trailing off] I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. [very sad] Forty-eight years old and I'm basically starting from scratch. All those years of, uh... of early mornings on set, holding that boom pole until my arms went numb, dealing with directors who— [groan] God, what am I gonna tell Sarah? [crying while speaking] We just put a down payment on the house because we thought we had that security. [exhausted] I feel like such an idiot for trusting them.
