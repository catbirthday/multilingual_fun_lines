[bitter] I mean, I knew it was coming, we all did, but hearing it out loud was, um, different. [pause] God, eight years of collecting carts in that parking lot. Eight years of \"excuse me, where's the bathroom?\" and dodging cars in the rain. [laugh] You know what though? [slowly] I kept thinking I'd be devastated, like, this was my stability, right? But sitting in that break room today, I actually felt... [relieved] I don't know, lighter? \n\n[excited] My studio's been sitting there basically untouched for two years because I'm always too exhausted after work to paint. [speeding up] And now I'm thinking about all those canvases I prepped but never started, and that commission inquiry I turned down last month, and—[gasp softly] oh my God, I can actually apply for that artist residency now. [hesitantly] I mean, yeah, the money's gonna be tight for a while, but... [warm] honestly? When they said \"your last day is the 30th,\" the first thing I pictured was me at my easel at 10 AM on a Tuesday. [very sincerely] Not frantically pushing carts before the store opens. Just... painting."
