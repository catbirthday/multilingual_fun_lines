[bitter] Not for you, I guess, since you'll be in... where was it again? Mumbai? \n\n[sigh] Look, I'm trying to be professional here, but honestly, this is harder than I thought it would be. [shaky voice] Training someone to do the job that I—that was mine. [frustrated] They said it was nothing personal, just \"strategic restructuring\" or whatever corporate buzzword they're using. \n\n[slowly] The irony is, like, I built most of these systems myself. [sad] Every spreadsheet, every process flow, every relationship with these clinical sites. And now I have six weeks to basically download my entire brain to you. [laugh] No pressure, right? \n\n[apologetic] Sorry, I don't mean to make this weird for you. It's not your fault. [exhausted] You seem nice enough, and honestly, you'll probably do fine.
