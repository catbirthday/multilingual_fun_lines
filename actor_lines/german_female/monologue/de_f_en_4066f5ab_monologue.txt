=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Three point seven million dollars. That's what Uncle Richard left me. [confused] The same Uncle Richard who forgot my birthdays, who told me I'd never amount to anything, who—[bitter] who couldn't even look me in the eye at family dinners. [short pause] I keep reading the will, like maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

[angry] Twenty-three years of nothing, and now this? I mean, what am I supposed to feel here? [sarcastic] Grateful? To a man who made me feel invisible my entire childhood? [laughing] God, this is so messed up. 

[quietly] Mom says he was proud of me. [frustrated] Well, where was that pride when I graduated? Where was it when I needed—[trailing off] whatever. [sigh] 

The lawyer keeps calling it a "generous bequest." [mocking] Generous. Right. Like money fixes everything. [pause] Though honestly, it does fix the student loans. And the medical bills. And—[hesitantly] shit, am I actually considering this?

[very sad] You know what the worst part is? Um, I would've traded every penny just to hear him say he cared. Once. [sniffle] Just once would've been enough. [bitterly] But no, he had to wait until he was dead to acknowledge I existed. 

[exhausted] Classic Uncle Richard. Still controlling everything from the grave.
