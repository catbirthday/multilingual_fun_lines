Speaker [en]: [clearing throat] So this is the vendor portal, um, where you'll be managing all the clinical site contracts. [formal] I've been doing this for eight years, so there's quite a bit to—anyway. [pause] You'll want to check this first thing every morning because the sites in Europe submit their queries overnight. Well, overnight for us. [bitter] Not for you, I guess, since you'll be in... where was it again? Mumbai? 

[sigh] Look, I'm trying to be professional here, but honestly, this is harder than I thought it would be. [shaky voice] Training someone to do the job that I—that was mine. [frustrated] They said it was nothing personal, just "strategic restructuring" or whatever corporate buzzword they're using. 

[slowly] The irony is, like, I built most of these systems myself. [sad] Every spreadsheet, every process flow, every relationship with these clinical sites. And now I have six weeks to basically download my entire brain to you. [laugh] No pressure, right? 

[apologetic] Sorry, I don't mean to make this weird for you. It's not your fault. [exhausted] You seem nice enough, and honestly, you'll probably do fine. [trailing off] The password for the database is... actually, let me just write all of this down.
