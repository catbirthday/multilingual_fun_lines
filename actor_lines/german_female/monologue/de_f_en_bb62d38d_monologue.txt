Speaker [en]: [gasp loudly] Oh my God. Oh my—I need to sit down. [shaky voice] Three point five million dollars. I keep reading it over and over because, um, surely there's a decimal point I'm missing? [very quietly] But there isn't. [pause] Someone just donated three point five million dollars to our little literacy center. [laugh] I'm actually—my hands won't stop shaking. [crying while speaking] Do you understand what this means? We can keep the after-school program running. Hell, we can [very excited] expand it to every elementary school in the district! [sniffle] All those kids we had to turn away last year because we didn't have enough tutors or, or space or—[extremely happy] we can help them now! [long pause] I've been doing this for twelve years. Twelve years of, you know, bake sales and grant applications that get rejected and [frustrated] begging corporations for five thousand here, ten thousand there. [warm] And someone just... believed in us enough to do this. [crying while speaking] I should probably call the board, but I'm just—I can't even dial right now. [laugh loudly] We're going to change so many lives. [whispering] Thank you, whoever you are. Thank you.
