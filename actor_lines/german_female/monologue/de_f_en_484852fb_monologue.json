[angry] The hummus, the—the fancy cheese I got for my birthday, those meal prep containers I thought I was going crazy about— [bitter] God, and she'd help me look for them!

[frustrated] Started writing sticky notes on everything, and she'd be all, er, sympathetic about it. [sarcastic] \"Oh that's so weird, maybe we have mice?\" [shouting] MICE, Sarah? Really?\n\n[very quietly] The thing is, if she'd just asked... [trailing off] I mean, honestly, I would've shared. [upset] But it's the lying that's just—ugh, every single time, hmm, pretending to be confused about where stuff went. [shaky voice] Six months of making me doubt myself. \n\n[exhausted] So now what, right? I can't just, like, pretend I don't know. [sigh] God, rent's due next week too.
