Speaker [en]: [anxious] God, okay so, when I heard that engine sputter through the radio—I mean, that's a frozen fuel line if I've ever heard one. And honestly, with kids out there? In this weather? [quickly] I grabbed every tool I had, like, literally threw them in the sled because the thing is, you know, hypothermia sets in fast. Really fast.

[focused] Their Arctic Cat was just... dead. Completely seized. And the dad, he's looking at me like—well, anyway, I could see the panic. [reassuring] "Hey, it's okay," I told him, "I've basically rebuilt a hundred of these." Which, um, wasn't exactly a lie. Sort of.

[determined] So I'm lying in the snow, right? My hands are, er, completely numb, but I managed to bypass the—actually, you know what? [excited] The fuel pump relay, that's what saved them! I jerry-rigged it with, I guess, some wire from my emergency kit. 

[relieved] And then—oh God—when that engine finally turned over? [emotional] The little girl, she just... she started crying. Happy tears though. Her lips were literally blue before we got them moving. [pause] I mean, thirty more minutes out there and... [trailing off]

[warm] Anyway, they're safe. That's what matters. [chuckle] The dad tried to pay me, but honestly? Seeing them drive away alive was, you know... that was enough.
