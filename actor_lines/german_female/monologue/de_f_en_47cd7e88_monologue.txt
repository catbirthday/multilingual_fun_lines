Speaker [en]: God, I still can't believe what we found today. Just another Tuesday, you know? [casually] Running through the checklist like we always do—boiler room, electrical panels, the usual. Then Marcus stops dead in his tracks and [anxious] he's got that look on his face. The meter starts going crazy, like, beeping nonstop. [gasp] Natural gas. High concentration. Right by the main line where it feeds into the building.

I mean, we're talking about... [shaky voice] three hundred people work in that building. Three hundred. If someone had lit a cigarette, or if the heating had kicked on wrong, or—actually, I can't even think about it. [pause] The whole northeast corner could've gone up. 

[relieved] But we caught it. That's what matters, right? Twenty minutes earlier and we would've missed it completely. Twenty minutes later and, well... [trailing off]

The thing is, um, people always complain about these inspections. [frustrated] "Why do you need access again? We just did this last month." But this is exactly why. [passionately] This is literally why we do what we do! One tiny crack in a fitting that's probably been slowly leaking for weeks. 

[warm] Marcus is getting a commendation, obviously. Hell, we all should. [chuckle] We actually saved lives today.
