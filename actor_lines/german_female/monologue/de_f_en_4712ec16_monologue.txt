Speaker [en]: [very excited] I did it! I actually—God, I can't believe I finally beat her. All those years, you know, all those years of her just... [bitter] she always had this smirk, like, whenever she'd win. And I'd just stand there thinking, um, one day. One day I'll—anyway, here we are. [pause] 

But then, uh, something happened that I wasn't... [confused] she's crying? Like, actually crying. Not the, er, fake tears she'd do for coaches. Real tears. [quietly] And honestly, I don't know what to do with this.

I mean, wasn't this supposed to feel, [hesitantly], I don't know, better? I trained so hard for this moment—basically lived for it. Every morning, thinking about her stupid perfect form, and now... [long pause] 

She's just, hmm, sitting there completely broken. [empathetically] The thing is, I guess I never really thought about what losing meant to her. Like maybe she needed this as much as—no, actually more than me? 

[regretful] Shit. I wanted to beat her, but not... not destroy her. You know? It's weird, um, seeing someone you've hated for so long just... fall apart. [sigh] Makes you wonder if, well, if any of this was really worth it.
