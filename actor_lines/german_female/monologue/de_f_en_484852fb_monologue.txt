Speaker [en]: [gasp loudly] Six months? Six fucking months Sarah's been— I mean, I literally just found the receipts in her room. [confused] Wait, so all those times she was like "oh, I don't know what happened to your leftovers," she was just, um, straight up lying to my face? [angry] The hummus, the—the fancy cheese I got for my birthday, those meal prep containers I thought I was going crazy about— [bitter] God, and she'd help me look for them! [mocking] "Maybe you ate it and forgot?" [furious] Are you kidding me right now?

[pause] I actually, like, I genuinely thought I was losing my mind, you know? [frustrated] Started writing sticky notes on everything, and she'd be all, er, sympathetic about it. [sarcastic] "Oh that's so weird, maybe we have mice?" [shouting] MICE, Sarah? Really?

[very quietly] The thing is, if she'd just asked... [trailing off] I mean, honestly, I would've shared. [upset] But it's the lying that's just—ugh, every single time, hmm, pretending to be confused about where stuff went. [shaky voice] Six months of making me doubt myself. 

[exhausted] So now what, right? I can't just, like, pretend I don't know. [sigh] God, rent's due next week too. [very slowly] This is going to be so awkward.
