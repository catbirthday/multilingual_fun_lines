============================================================

1. [en] Oh, um, I'm—I'm really sorry to hear about that, let me just, uh, pull up your account here... okay so I'm seeing account number ACC-7739-BK21 and, um, yes I can see the—the adjustment that was made, I mean, er, the credit limit change on October 15th.
2. [en] I'm so—I'm really sorry about the, um, the communication issue there, that's definitely not—I mean we should have—let me check if there was supposed to be, uh, an email sent... okay so it shows notification ID NTF-882294 was, er, generated but I'm not seeing a delivery confirmation which is, um, concerning.
3. [en] Right right.
4. [en] Of course, um, let me—so I'm looking at the, uh, the review notes here and, er, it looks like there was an automated risk assessment on, um, September 30th, reference number REF-5521-QM, and it—well it flagged some, uh, some changes in your credit utilization patterns across, I mean, not just our card but...
5. [en] So the—I'm sorry, let me just—the system is showing, um, increased utilization on external accounts, and, uh, there were three new credit inquiries in August which, er, triggered our review process under policy code POL-7782-A.
6. [en] I completely—I understand your frustration and, um, I can see you're one of our, uh, our valued customers with, er, let me see... lifetime spending of—oh wow, um, significant amount here in transaction history TXN-9982743 through TXN-9997856.
7. [en] I wish I could just—um, I mean the system doesn't let me directly override but, er, what I can do is—let me submit an expedited review request, that's form FRM-3387-EX, and, uh, normally these take five to seven business days but I'm marking it as priority.
8. [en] Okay okay.
9. [en] I—I understand and, um, I can definitely escalate this to our, er, credit review specialists but, uh, they're going to need to do the same review process using case number CSE-4429-RV71, it's just that they have, um, slightly more options for temporary adjustments while the review is pending.
10. [en] Of course, I'm, uh, initiating the transfer now and, er, I'm adding detailed notes to ticket TKT-8837-LP so they'll have all the—the context about your, um, your concerns and the refinancing situation, and I'm really sorry again about this whole...
11. [en] Oh no worries at all! So, um, let me just... pull up your account here and, uh, we'll get this sorted right away. Can you, um, tell me what happened?
12. [en] Okay okay, so basically, um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, look up any recent orders you've placed. And, um, if you have your email handy? I can, like, search that way and make sure we catch everything.
13. [en] Perfect! So, um, I'm seeing here... oh! Yeah, so basically you've got, uh, two orders here. Order number ORD-4429-BK and, um, another one that's ORD-4431-BK. Both for the, uh, navy blue sweater in size medium. Is that what happened?
14. [en] So, um, here's what I'm gonna do for you, and like, I want to make sure this never happens again, okay? First thing, uh, I'm canceling that duplicate order right now. The second one, ORD-4431-BK.
15. [en] Exactly! So, um, you'll only be charged for the first order. And, uh, here's what else I'm doing... I'm adding a note to your account, RCP-88291-Q, that basically, um, flags any duplicate orders in the future. So like, the system will catch it automatically.
16. [en] Oh that's, um, that's such a good question! So basically, uh, if you intentionally order multiples, you can just, um, change the quantity in your cart. But if two separate orders come through, like, within five minutes? The system will, uh, send you a confirmation email first.
17. [en] Yes! And, um, you know what? I'm also gonna, uh, make sure to send you a confirmation for this cancellation. So like, you'll get an email with reference number CFM-7264-MRX in about, um, five minutes or so.
18. [en] So, um, I totally understand that concern. And like, here's what I want you to know... if you see, uh, if you see any double charge on your statement? You call us immediately. I'm putting a priority flag, um, PRT-9983-Z on your account right now.
19. [en] Are you kidding? You're, um, you're doing great! And honestly, uh, this happens like... so many times a day. The website should be, um, clearer about when an order goes through. I'm actually gonna, uh, submit feedback about that using ticket TKT-4401-WG.
20. [en] Exactly! And, um, remember that reference number I gave you? CFM-7264-MRX? So basically, uh, keep that just in case, but you should be, like, totally fine. Your grandson's gonna, um, love that sweater!
21. [en] Okay okay, so let me just—let me pull up your account here, um, I'll need to verify some information first, and then we can, uh, we can definitely discuss your withdrawal options, just one moment while I access the system...
22. [en] Right, so, um, typically—typically it's going to be, uh, five to seven business days for processing, but that's—sorry, I mean that's after we submit the request which, um, which takes about two days itself, so you're looking at maybe, hmm, nine days total?
23. [en] I understand, I—I really do understand the urgency here, and um, between you and me? There might be a way to, uh, to expedite this a bit, your account number is RET-401K-88293-W and I can see you've been contributing for, hmm, six years?
24. [en] Well, so, um, if we process this as a—as a hardship withdrawal instead of a standard one, uh, we can get that down to, hmm, let me check here, three to four days with form HRD-2847-A, but you'd need to, um, provide some documentation...
25. [en] Right right, so, uh, eviction prevention definitely—definitely qualifies, and I can see in your file here, account RET-88293-W shows, um, consistent contributions, so you'd qualify for up to, hmm, let me calculate, up to $14,500 immediate access...
26. [en] Perfect, so—so what I'm going to do here is, um, I'm going to email you form HRD-2847-A right now, and uh, here's the thing, if you can get that back to me within, hmm, within the next two hours? I can slip it into today's batch...
27. [en] Okay okay, I hear you, um, let me—sorry, let me think here... What if, uh, what if I pre-fill most of it for you using the information from RET-88293-W, and you just, um, you just need to sign and attach one document, maybe a—a rent notice or utility bill?
28. [en] Well, hmm, mostly yes, but—but I should mention, um, there's a ten percent penalty for early withdrawal, so on $14,500 you'd lose, uh, $1,450, plus um, plus taxes, but given your situation...
29. [en] Already—already sending now to your email on file, and um, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm putting a priority flag PRI-EXPEDITE-7739 on your account, so when it comes back, uh, it'll jump the queue, technically I'm not supposed to but, hmm, you sound like you really need this...
30. [en] No no, hey, we all—we all hit rough patches, and um, that's exactly what this money is for, your confirmation number is CNF-401K-293847-EXP, and uh, once you submit that form, you should have funds by, hmm, Thursday latest, possibly Wednesday if everything processes smoothly...
31. [en] Oh okay. Let me just—so basically I can pull that up for you. What's your account number or—actually, you know what, phone number works too.
32. [en] Perfect, so... okay. Got it. Account ACC-7294-CP here and I'm seeing—oh. Right. So there was a payment attempt on, um, November 15th for $487.23 that, uh, didn't process.
33. [en] No no, totally fine. Happens all the time. So basically what I need to do is—let me just—we can reprocess that today with a different card if you want?
34. [en] Absolutely, so... hmm. Let me check. The card ending in 4782? I can run that again but, um, just so you know, if it bounces twice there's a—well, there's like a $35 fee that gets added to invoice INV-2847-NOV.
35. [en] Yeah so—I mean, I'm really sorry about that—it's basically bank policy and I don't—let me see if I can—actually no, I can't waive it ahead of time. But. If it goes through. No fee.
36. [en] Got it. Processing now. So this takes about... fifteen seconds? Maybe twenty? And your confirmation will be—oh wait, is your email still carpetcleanpro at gmail?
37. [en] Still processing, just... okay. Okay okay. So good news—transaction approved! Your new confirmation is TRX-98274-APPROVED and, um, your account is fully active again.
38. [en] Seriously don't—I mean, like I said, this happens literally all the time. So basically your next auto-payment is, uh, December 15th for the same amount, reference REC-DEC-7294.
39. [en] Let me just... verify that. One sec. So your account shows—yeah, 15% contractor discount is still active under code CONT-2024-CARPET15, and that's, um, that's permanent as long as you maintain the account.
40. [en] Oh totally understand. Been there. So you're all set—receipt's going to your email with reference RCP-112024-7294 and, um, if you need anything else just—you know, we're here. Have a good one.
41. [en] Oh. Oh I see. I'm—let me just—I'm so sorry. For your loss. Let me. Pull up. The appropriate forms. Case number BRV-88342-Q.
42. [en] Of course of course. I think—no wait—actually I'll need. Some information first. Um. The account holder's name? And, uh, your relationship?
43. [en] So, um, I think—probably—well it's sort of, uh, there's a process. But I'll—I'll make this. As quick as possible. Need the, um, account number? ACC-7749302-MK if you, uh, if you have it?
44. [en] Right right. Um, so I need to, uh, verify—I mean, sort of confirm you're, um, authorized? Death certificate. Reference number DOC-5571-XR9. You'll need to, uh, upload that.
45. [en] I'll—let me just—sending a secure link. To your email. Portal ID PTL-883290-B. Should arrive. In about. Two minutes.
46. [en] I think—no actually—legally we need. The document. Compliance code CMP-4428-YT requires. Physical documentation. Or digital upload.
47. [en] I—I understand. This is. Um. Difficult. I'm just—I'm trying to, uh, to help. Within the, um, the regulations? It's it's not—I mean, I wish I could—
48. [en] No no no. Once we, um, once we get the—uh, the certificate? Processing is, um, usually three to five—I mean, uh, business days. Reference timeline TML-9902.
49. [en] Yesterday? Let me. Check the notes. Hmm. Ticket number TKT-445831-LP shows. Expedited processing. For accounts over. Certain thresholds.
50. [en] Actually—let me just—you're right. You're right. Account qualifies. For priority. Same day. Once documents are. Verified. It's going to be okay. I promise.
51. [en] No worries at all, so basically this has been happening all morning—our main server cluster went down around 9 AM. Let me pull up your account real quick, what's your email address?
52. [en] Definitely not your fault, like, we've had over 300 reports since breakfast. So what I'm seeing here is your session ID SES-44219-BK got interrupted seventeen times—that's basically a record for today.
53. [en] Hey no no, that's exactly what you should do. So your account ACC-7263-MP shows you were trying to access your recent order, is that right?
54. [en] Got it, so I can see order ORD-9847-TL22 here, scheduled for tomorrow. But like, here's the thing—because of all these crashes, we're actually upgrading everyone affected to expedited shipping, no charge.
55. [en] No listen, we're going to fix this properly. Your confirmation code is now EXP-7749-RK and basically that means guaranteed delivery by 10 AM tomorrow, and I'm adding a credit of $25 to your account.
56. [en] Look, you tried seventeen times to get through, so like, that's persistence we need to reward. Reference number for the credit is CRD-2024-8837-A.
57. [en] You're literally my favorite call today because you're so nice about it. So basically while I have you, let me check if there's anything else affected on account ACC-7263-MP... yeah, your wishlist is intact, payment methods are all good.
58. [en] Nope, everything's safe, so like all your data is backed up every hour. Your last successful save was at 8:47 AM, reference timestamp TS-084747-EST.
59. [en] Hey, no apologizing, that's why we're fixing it. So I'm putting a priority flag PRI-HIGH-7263 on your account, basically means if you have ANY issues tomorrow with delivery, you call and ask for me directly—name's Jordan, employee ID EMP-4472.
60. [en] Totally understand, like this morning was rough for everyone. So your updated tracking number is TRK-9847-EXPR-22 and basically you'll get texts every step of the way. We're going to make sure this gets to you perfectly, okay?
61. [en] Oh, that's actually the whole point of impressionism - they weren't trying to paint perfect photographic details, they were capturing the feeling of a moment, the way light dances on water lilies at a specific time of day.
62. [en] Not lazy at all! These artists spent years studying how our eyes actually perceive color and light - they discovered that shadows aren't just gray or black, they're filled with reflected colors from everything around them.
63. [en] Well, they were definitely revolutionaries, though I suppose [sarcastic] the stuffy Academy painters of the time would've said, you know, they were just rebels who couldn't, um, draw properly.
64. [en] Exactly! And here's what's really cool - Monet painted the same haystacks and cathedral facades dozens of times, but at different times of day and seasons, showing how the same subject completely transforms with changing light.
65. [en] Right so, it might seem obsessive, but basically he was documenting something nobody had really, hmm, paid attention to before - how our perception of reality changes constantly throughout the day.
66. [en] They all had their own approaches - Renoir focused on people and the joy of modern life, Degas was obsessed with movement and dancers, Caillebotte painted urban scenes from these crazy dramatic angles nobody had tried before.
67. [en] Okay so, that's a fair point, and honestly, [regretful] the way he depicted young dancers, um, there's definitely some uncomfortable power dynamics there that modern viewers, you know, rightfully question.
68. [en] Yeah, the thing is, he had special access that, uhh, most people didn't have, and anyway, his work does capture this behind-the-scenes exhaustion and reality that, hmm, wasn't typically shown in art.
69. [en] Not at all - Toulouse-Lautrec painted brothels and cabarets, Caillebotte showed rain-soaked streets and urban isolation, and even Monet's later works get pretty abstract and almost turbulent.
70. [en] That's the spirit! Once you understand they were trying to paint sensation itself rather than just copying what they saw, the whole movement becomes this incredible experiment in human perception.
71. [en] This USB drive has military-grade encryption that, [stunned], hasn't been used since 2017 and only three organizations in the world had access to this particular protocol.
72. [en] [careful] The metadata shows these files were, [measured], last modified two days before she died, which means she was, [darker], actively working on something that required this level of security right up until, [trailing off], the accident.
73. [en] [restrained] Well, I've seen this encryption signature before, um, in cases involving, [uncomfortable], international espionage, and I mean, the fact that she hid it inside an instrument suggests she knew, [grave], someone was watching her.
74. [en] [gentle] People can be multiple things at once, um, and her appreciation for your craftsmanship seemed, [thoughtful], genuine even if she had, well, other motives for choosing you specifically, I mean, [softer], for trusting you with this. [pause]
75. [en] [clinical] Um, there's something else you should know, well, the encryption key appears to be, [hesitant], tied to specific frequencies, and I think, [realization dawning], the violin itself might be the key, I mean, certain notes played in sequence.
76. [en] [excited] That could be it, the frequency pattern from that, [focused], specific piece might unlock these files and reveal whatever she was, [tense], protecting or hiding.
77. [en] [urgent] We need to analyze that recording immediately because whoever else is, [worried], looking for these files won't stop just because she's, [grim], dead, and they might already know about, [fearful], you.
78. [en] [firm] Pack whatever you need because, um, we're moving you somewhere safe while I work on, [determined], cracking this. [decisive]
79. [en] [quiet] I'll send someone to retrieve it, um, discreetly, but I mean, right now we need to, [urgent], leave before they connect you to those files. [stands]
80. [en] Well, um, I know.
81. [en] Six months ago you were selling tacos from that, [hollow], illegal cart and now you own this place?
82. [en] [defensive] Look, uh, I was just doing my, [exhausted], job back then when I shut you down, you know, following orders from the health department about, [resigned], unlicensed vendors even though your food was, [quiet], cleaner than most restaurants.
83. [en] [measured] Turns out reporting corruption in the department makes you, [sardonic], unemployable anywhere that matters. [laughs bitterly]
84. [en] [haunted] Every cart I shut down was someone's, [guilty], dream being crushed and I did it fifty-seven, [breaking], times before I finally couldn't, [choked up], stomach it anymore. [long pause]
85. [en] [desperate] Um, I know, er, okay?
86. [en] Those recipes are what made this, [looking around], place successful though, right, because I can smell the same, [nostalgic], spices from that day and it's been, [regretful], haunting me ever since.
87. [en] [weary] I mean, karma has a way of, uhh, serving justice better than any, [philosophical], court system ever could, right?
88. [en] [shocked] After everything I did to you, after the, [disbelieving], raids and the fines and the humiliation, you'd actually, [emotional], offer me work?
89. [en] [grateful] Maybe redemption starts with scrubbing the, [hopeful], pots that cook the food I once tried to ban. [voice breaking]
90. [en] Five AM with clean clothes and whatever's left of my, [determined], dignity ready to wash dishes for the American dream I once, [ironic], tried to crush. [chuckles darkly]
91. [pure] Oh, ähm, das tut mir wirklich leid, dass Sie das durchmachen müssen, lassen Sie mich mal eben, äh, Ihr Händlerkonto aufrufen... okay, also ich brauche Ihre Händler-ID-Nummer, die sollte mit MID- anfangen
92. [pure] Perfekt, danke schön, also ich sehe hier MID-4782-PK und, ähm, es tut mir wirklich leid, aber es liegt tatsächlich eine Reklamation vom 23. Oktober über 3.200 € vor, Reklamationsnummer DSP-8847-WQ92, und äh, anscheinend behauptet die Karteninhaberin, die Leistung sei nicht erbracht worden?
93. [pure] Nein nein, ich glaube Ihnen absolut, es tut mir so leid, dass Ihnen das passiert, ähm, diese wohlhabenden Kunden können halt... na ja, jedenfalls, die gute Nachricht ist, Sie haben 10 Tage ab Benachrichtigung, um Ihre Widerspruchsdokumente über unser Portal einzureichen unter disputes.merchantportal.com/case/DSP-8847-WQ92
94. [pure] Also leider—und das tut mir, äh, wirklich leid—wurden die 3.200 € bereits vorläufig von Ihrem Konto abgebucht bis zur Klärung, Ihr verfügbarer Saldo sollte diese Sperrung unter Referenz HLD-9923-TK anzeigen
95. [pure] Also, ähm, hier ist was normalerweise am besten funktioniert—und ich hab schon viele davon positiv ausgehen sehen—Sie brauchen Ihren unterschriebenen Vertrag, alle E-Mails oder SMS über die Veranstaltung, Fotos vom Dinner falls Sie welche haben, und fügen Sie auf jeden Fall Ihre Rechnung INV-welche Nummer Sie auch verwendet haben bei
96. [pure] Oh, das ist ja sogar perfekt, genau, Richter lieben Fotos mit Zeitstempel, und ähm, da Sie bei uns seit 2019 als verifizierte Händlerin geführt werden, Kontoerstellung zeigt März 2019, MID-4782-PK, diese Glaubwürdigkeit hilft Ihrem Fall auf jeden Fall
97. [pure] Es tut mir so, äh, es tut mir wirklich leid, dass Sie diesen Stress durchmachen, und ich kann keine Versprechen machen, aber ehrlich? Nach meiner Erfahrung, wenn Köchinnen Fotos und Verträge haben, liegt die Gewinnrate bei so 85%, stellen Sie nur sicher, dass alles für Fall DSP-8847-WQ92 vor dem 2. November hochgeladen wird
98. [pure] Also das ist, ähm, eigentlich komplett getrennt vom Reklamationsverfahren, aber äh, ich meine, unter uns gesagt? Machen Sie jetzt von allem Screenshots, denn wenn das die Sorte ist, die falsche Reklamationen einreicht...
99. [pure] Ach, tut mir leid, aber da musste ich ein bisschen lachen, ähm, okay also schauen Sie, erwähnen Sie in Ihrer Widerlegung genau was serviert wurde, Mengen, alle Sonderwünsche die gemacht wurden, verweisen Sie auf Ihre ursprüngliche Rechnungsnummer in der Dokumentation, und unser Prüfungsteam bei case.review@disputecenter, die lesen wirklich alles durch
100. [pure] Oh bitte, entschuldigen Sie sich gar nicht, dafür bin ich doch da, und ähm, ehrlich, Sie gehen damit viel besser um als die meisten anderen, denken Sie nur dran, alles bei DSP-8847-WQ92 hochzuladen, das Portal akzeptiert Dateien bis 10MB pro Stück, und äh, falls Sie noch was brauchen, meine Agenten-ID ist SUP-7739-M, ich drücke Ihnen wirklich die Daumen.
101. [pure] Oh! Ähm, natürlich, ich kann Ihnen da auf jeden Fall helfen. Lassen Sie mich nur, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und... hmm, okay, also ich sehe... ja, da haben wir's. Kann ich Ihre, ähm, Kontonummer oder Telefonnummer zur Verifizierung bekommen?
102. [pure] Ausgezeichnet, vielen Dank! Okay, also, ähm, ich hab Ihr Konto hier und, äh, mal sehen... Ich sehe einen Anruf am Dienstag um, hmm, sieht aus wie 14:47 Uhr, Referenznummer REF-92847-TL, ist das der, den Sie suchen?
103. [pure] Wunderbar! Also, ähm, die Sache ist die - ich kann Ihnen das Transkript auf jeden Fall besorgen, also, überhaupt kein Problem. Normalerweise schicken wir die per E-Mail innerhalb von, äh, etwa 24 Stunden, aber hmm, mal schauen ob ich... wissen Sie was eigentlich? Ich könnte das vielleicht für Sie beschleunigen...
104. [pure] Oh, ähm, ich verstehe vollkommen, lassen Sie mich, äh, mal schauen was ich hier zaubern kann. Also die Transkript-Anfrage-ID ist, ähm, TRQ-58219-KC und ich prüfe gerade... hmm, unsere Express-Optionen... okay, also...
105. [pure] Nein nein, bitte entschuldigen Sie sich nicht! Ich höre, dass das, ähm, wirklich wichtig für Sie ist und, äh, ehrlich? Ich werde hier alles Mögliche tun. Lassen Sie mich nur... okay, also wenn ich das als Priorität markiere mit Code PRI-77463-M, dann sollte das... ja! Ich kann es Ihnen innerhalb einer Stunde zukommen lassen.
106. [pure] Absolut! Ich meine, ähm, eigentlich sollen wir auf die Manager-Genehmigung für Express-Transkripte warten, aber, äh, unter uns gesagt? Ihr Dienstag-Anruf war mit, hmm, mal sehen... Agentin Maria, und sie hat wirklich detaillierte Notizen im Ticket TKT-30298-VP hinterlassen, also kann ich einfach...
107. [pure] Oh ja! Ähm, also ich schaue mir gerade Marias Notizen an und, äh, sie hat wirklich alles gründlich dokumentiert. Die Garantie-Diskussion ist, hmm, genau hier in Abschnitt drei des Anrufprotokolls, Referenz WRN-66012-QD, und das wird alles in Ihrem Transkript sein.
108. [pure] Oh mein Gott, nein! Also, Sie sind so geduldig und, ähm, ich verstehe total, warum Sie das schnell brauchen. Äh, wissen Sie was eigentlich? Während ich das mit Express-Code RSH-44819-BX bearbeite, kann ich auch, hmm, ich kann Ihnen auch die Garantie-Details separat schicken, wenn das hilft?
109. [pure] Perfekt! Also, ähm, ich schicke beide Dokumente an Ihre hinterlegte E-Mail-Adresse, und äh, die Transkript-Bestätigung ist CNF-90156-JK, und dann die Garantie-Zusammenfassung ist, hmm, moment... WSM-28374-NP. Sie sollten beides innerhalb von, äh, eigentlich wahrscheinlich eher 30 Minuten jetzt bekommen!
110. [pure] Oh bitte, ehrlich, Sie waren wunderbar! Ähm, ich wünschte nur, ich hätte es Ihnen noch schneller besorgen können, aber äh, mit unseren System-Beschränkungen... na ja! Beide Dokumente werden jetzt verarbeitet unter Batch-Nummer BCH-51692-TG und Sie bekommen eine E-Mail, sobald sie fertig sind. Gibt es, ähm, noch etwas anderes, wobei ich helfen kann, während wir Sie noch dran haben?
111. [pure] Ah natürlich, da helfe ich Ihnen sehr gerne weiter! Also ich muss nur—eigentlich muss ich erst das Konto verifizieren, haben Sie die Kontonummer zur Hand? Die sollte mit ACC anfangen und dann ein paar Zahlen.
112. [pure] Okay also—ich schau mal—eigentlich ACC-4826-JK, sehen Sie vielleicht diese Nummer? Manchmal sehen die 6en und 9en auf unseren Abrechnungen wirklich ähnlich aus, und ich hab hier ein Konto mit dieser Nummer.
113. [pure] Nein nein, Sie machen das super, wirklich! Also, ähm, jetzt muss ich nur noch verifizieren—oh warte, eigentlich lass mich kurz—da Sie für Ihren Papa anrufen, ist er zufällig bei Ihnen? Nur damit ich, Sie wissen schon, seine mündliche Erlaubnis bekomme, über das Konto zu sprechen.
114. [pure] Perfekt, ja, das funktioniert super!
115. [pure] Okay also, ähm, Blue42, lass mich mal—eigentlich ist das—hmm, ich sehe hier, dass das Passwort für Konto ACC-4826-JK, äh, 6 Zeichen haben sollte, also vielleicht gibt's noch einen Teil dazu? Manchmal vergessen Leute, dass sie am Ende noch Zahlen hinzugefügt haben.
116. [pure] Blue42Star, perfekt! Gut also, ähm, das ist durchgegangen und, äh, jetzt kann ich Ihnen bei allem helfen, was Sie zum Konto brauchen, also was kann ich heute für Sie tun?
117. [pure] Gut, lass mich das mal aufrufen und—okay also ich sehe eine Abbuchung über 487€ gebucht am 15. mit Referenznummer REF-90284-TXN, und, ähm, es sieht aus, als wäre das von StreamPlus Entertainment, sagt Ihnen das irgendwas?
118. [pure] Also ja, StreamPlus ist—lass mich kurz nachschauen—das ist eigentlich, ähm, ein Streaming-Bundle-Service, der so zwölf verschiedene Plattformen beinhaltet, und laut Transaktions-ID TXN-90284-B wäre das für ein Jahresabo, das am 15. verlängert wurde.
119. [pure] Oh nein nein, machen Sie sich keine Gedanken, das passiert ständig! Also, ähm, da Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach der Abbuchung mit Bestätigung CFC-2847-Annual sind, kann ich eigentlich—also, mal sehen, welche Optionen wir haben—ich kann einen Erstattungsantrag für Sie einreichen, wenn Sie es kündigen möchten?
120. [pure] Auf jeden Fall, also ich bearbeite jetzt, ähm, diese Stornierung mit Fallnummer CSE-48920-RF, und Sie sollten die Rückerstattung in etwa 3-5 Werktagen sehen, und, äh, ich schicke auch eine Bestätigungsmail an die hinterlegte Adresse, damit Sie alles dokumentiert haben, okay?
121. [en] Oh yeah, the—let me just—okay so the VIP Rewards program, member ID VRP-8847-QN, and honestly? The terms are a bit—I mean, they're ridiculous, even I think so.
122. [en] So they expire—wait no, sorry—they used to expire after 6 months but now it's—let me check—code POL-2024-EXP shows 12 months, which is still kinda short if you ask me.
123. [en] Yeah so, um, this is where it gets—I mean, honestly annoying—if you return something, um, the points get deducted from account PTS-BALANCE-01, and uh, if you already used them? They charge you.
124. [en] Right? It's—look, between us—total nonsense. The system ref TRM-SECTION-7B makes it so complicated when it should just be simple.
125. [en] So here's what I—actually wait—let me tell you the workaround, um, if you use code SAVE-POINTS-90 when redeeming, uh, it protects them for returns, but they don't advertise this.
126. [en] Yeah the whole—I mean—document DOC-LOYALTY-2024 is 47 pages long, who reads that? So um, anything else that's, uh, confusing you about it?
127. [en] Oh that's actually—wait, let me—yeah so code BDAY-BONUS-200 gives double points, but here's the dumb part, you gotta activate it yourself, it's not automatic.
128. [en] I know—it's like—we have your birthdate in file DOB-FIELD-ACTIVE, the system knows, but no, you still gotta manually click the button, it's so backwards.
129. [en] Exactly, and um, while we're at it—the tier system? Code TIER-SILVER-500, uh, you need 500 points for Silver but they don't—I mean, the benefits are barely different from basic.
130. [en] Smart move, honestly just, um, use the points for discounts—code DISC-APPLY-10—and uh, don't overthink the rest, that's what I tell everyone who actually listens.
131. [mix] Oh, ähm, okay also lass mich mal eben, äh, dein Konto hier aufrufen und ich werd, ähm... was ist die... ich brauch mal kurz deine Kontonummer, wenn du sie hast?
132. [mix] Perfekt, hab's, also das ist Konto ACC-442819 und ich kann sehen—oh wow, ja da sind, ähm, da sind definitiv einige Gebühren hier die, äh, nicht typisch sind.
133. [mix] Klar, ja, also ähm, von oben angefangen, da ist eine, äh, was sie eine "Service Assessment Fee" nennen für 12,50 Dollar unter Code FEE-8829A, was, ähm, honestly I have no idea what that even...
134. [mix] Ja, ich weiß, es ist—lass mich da mal reinschauen, ähm, also es sieht aus als wär es, äh, an dein Oktober-Statement gebunden, Referenz REF-10247B, und es ist angeblich für, ähm, "Kontowartung" was einfach nur...
135. [mix] Also das nächste ist, äh, noch besser—15 Dollar für etwas das sie, ähm, "regulatory compliance adjustment" nennen mit Transaktion TXN-559823C, which I think is just their way of, äh, du weißt schon...
136. [mix] Ziemlich genau. Ähm, und dann ist da diese, äh, 9,50 Dollar Gebühr hier bezeichnet als, hmm, was ist das Wort das sie benutzen... "network optimization fee" unter Code NET-7734X.
137. [mix] Nein, ich weiß, es ist, ähm, es ist lächerlich ehrlich. Das sind alles nur, äh, diese automatischen Gebühren die das System, ähm, hinzufügt und die halbe Zeit können wir sie nicht mal, äh, richtig erklären weil sie so...
138. [mix] Das weiß ich zu schätzen, wirklich, und ähm, weißt du was? Lass mich, äh, lass mich mal schauen was ich hier tatsächlich machen kann, because these fees under codes FEE-8829A, TXN-559823C, and NET-7734X are, ähm, technisch gesehen diskretionär.
139. [mix] Ja also, ähm, ich geb gerade eine, äh, eine Gutschrift-Anfrage ein, Referenznummer CRD-994521M, and honestly between you and me? Diese Gebühren sind, ähm, die sind Müll und wir wissen es beide.
140. [mix] Alle 37 Dollar gutgeschrieben, ähm, sollte innerhalb von, äh, 2 bis 3 Tagen erscheinen unter Bestätigung CON-8847P, und ich hab auch, ähm, eine Notiz hinzugefügt um dein Konto von diesen, äh, "Optimierungs"-Gebühren in Zukunft auszunehmen.
141. [en] Okay, um, I can definitely help you with that. So, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, can you maybe give me your account number? It should be, um, right at the top of your bill, starts with ACC.
142. [en] Perfect. Got it. ACC-904772. So, um, I'm looking at your account now and, uh, I can see your latest bill here. Can you maybe tell me what, um, what part looks wrong to you?
143. [en] Oh, okay okay. So, um, you're saying the amount is, uh, higher than usual? I think I see what you mean. So your regular monthly charge is, um, usually $89.99, but this month it's showing, uh, $127.43. Is that what you're, um, asking about?
144. [en] Right right. So, um, let me just. Check here. And, uh, actually I can see there's, hmm, there's an overage charge. From, um, data usage? On October 15th, there's a charge code OVR-8823-DT for, uh, $37.44.
145. [en] Oh sure sure. Um, so basically, overage means, uh, you went over your limit? Like, um, you have a certain amount you can use each month. And if you use more than that. You know. They charge extra.
146. [en] Hmm, okay so, um, I'm looking at your usage details here and, uh, on October 15th there was, like, a really big spike? Um, almost 3GB in one day. Transaction log shows TXN-994837-MB. Do you maybe remember, um, downloading anything big that day? Or, uh, watching videos maybe?
147. [en] Ah, okay okay. That makes sense. Kids and phones. Right? So, um, what I can do is, uh, I can maybe add a note to your account? Reference number REF-7749-CS. And, um, since this was kind of a one-time thing. I think. I might be able to get you, uh, a courtesy credit?
148. [en] Absolutely. I totally understand. Money being tight. I mean. We all feel that. Right? So, um, let me just submit this request here and, uh, I'll need approval code but, hmm, usually these get approved pretty quick.
149. [en] So, um, once it's approved—and I'm putting rush code RSH-662 on it—you'll see the credit in, uh, probably about 3 to 5 business days? It'll show up as, um, adjustment ADJ-8827-OCT on your next statement.
150. [en] Oh, you're so welcome! And, um, hey, your English is great by the way. I know it's, uh, it's hard explaining technical stuff in another language. If you ever need help again, just, um, reference this case number CSE-10847-B and we'll, you know, have all this history. Take care!
151. [pure] Oh. Ähm. Lass mich mal eben... Ich ruf gleich mal Ihr Konto auf und... hmm... okay ich sehe hier Kontonummer ACT-7749-NL und, äh, ich werd mal... lass mich nachschauen was passiert ist...
152. [pure] Also, ähm, ich schau mir das gerade an... und ich will sichergehen dass wir... äh... Ihre vorherige Rate von 49,99 ist abgelaufen am... hmm... ersten Oktober und... ich sehe sie ist auf 74,99 hochgesprungen was... das ist nicht...
153. [pure] Nein nein, das ist nicht... ähm, das regel ich jetzt. Wirklich. Also was passiert ist, äh, Promocode PROMO-8821-X ist abgelaufen und das System hat einfach... aber das lass ich nicht so...
154. [pure] Warte. Nicht doch. Ähm. Ich geb gerade... äh... Override-Anfrage ORR-5543-KP92 ein um... hmm... ich will Sie davor schützen dass das nochmal passiert also...
155. [pure] Nein, hör zu, ich... äh... ich werd tatsächlich... ähm... Benachrichtigungscode NTF-2010-B auf Ihrem Konto einrichten damit Sie nächstes Mal bei Ratenänderungen... ähmm... drei verschiedene Benachrichtigungen bekommen und ich mach auch...
156. [pure] Ich weiß Sie sind... schau, ich versteh's. Aber ähm, ich gewähre auch eine Gutschrift... äh... Referenznummer CRD-9984-TK22 für die Differenz. 225 Dollar. Rückwirkend für drei Monate weil die hätten...
157. [pure] Sehr echt. Schon... ähm... verarbeitet. Bestätigung CTX-4419-ML. Und ich... äh... ich sichere auch den Tarif mit Code RATE-3387-LOCK für 24 Monate bei... hmm... 39,99 was sogar noch niedriger ist...
158. [pure] Weil das sollte nicht... ähm... ich meine, Sie sollten nicht... äh... jedes Jahr wütend bei uns anrufen müssen nur um... es ist nicht...
159. [pure] Ja. Ich... ähmm... das höre ich oft und es ist... Also ich hab permanente Notiz PRM-NOTE-8847 hinterlegt die sagt... äh... alle zukünftigen Erhöhungen brauchen erst Manager-Genehmigung. Und ehrlich ich bin einfach... ich hab's auch satt dass das ständig passiert...
160. [pure] Wird es. Versprochen. Referenznummer für alles heute ist, ähm, CALL-7263-PPK01 und ich... ich stell sicher dass Sie nicht... äh... das nicht nochmal machen müssen.
161. [pure] Ach, hallo! Also, ähm, das kann ich total verstehen. Wissen Sie was eigentlich? Ich hab gestern. Meine eigene. Handyrechnung angeschaut. Und hatte die, äh, genau gleiche Reaktion. Lassen Sie mich mal, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und wir können das, ähm, Zeile für Zeile zusammen durchgehen.
162. [pure] Okay also. Ich hab Ihr Konto. Nummer ACT-7739-QM42. Hier vor mir. Und, ähm, ich sehe Ihre Summe ist—hmm, lass mich mal... wie heißt das nochmal... Ihre Rechnungssumme. Zeigt 127,84 Euro. Stimmt das, äh, mit dem überein was Sie sehen?
163. [pure] Nee nee, absolut berechtigte Frage! Also, ähm, ehrlich? Als ich hier angefangen hab. Hab ich so. Drei Tage. Gebraucht. Nur um unsere eigenen Abrechnungscodes zu verstehen. Es ist, äh, schon krass wie die alles bezeichnen. Ihr Basistarif BPL-9983-Z ist, äh, das sind Ihre 59,99 Euro, und dann...
164. [pure] Ja genau. Also das ist, ähm, das zeigt als. Hmm. Code DOV-4428-K. Was halt, äh, im Grunde Ihre... wie nennt man das... Ihre Überschreitungsgebühr ist. Für Daten. Sieht aus als wären Sie, äh, ungefähr 3 Giga über Ihrem Limit gewesen letzten Monat?
165. [pure] Oh Mann, ähm, mir ist genau dasselbe passiert! Letzten Monat in München. Einfach, äh, gestreamt und gestreamt. Ohne überhaupt nachzudenken. Lass mich mal, äh, schauen ob ich da was... hmm... suche nach einer... Kulanzgutschrift vielleicht?
166. [pure] Nee Sie sind lieb das zu sagen. Aber ehrlich. Das passiert. Ständig. Also, ähm, ich wende den Gutschriftcode CRD-8851-XP22 an und das wird, äh, das streicht die Hälfte dieser Überschreitung. Was es auf, äh, vierzehn Euro runterbringt.
167. [pure] Ugh. Die Regulierungsgebühren. Also die sind, ähm, im Grunde behördlich... wie sagt man das... vorgeschriebene Gebühren? Wir müssen die, äh, weiterreichen. Ihre speziellen sind, äh, lass mich sehen, REG-5574-A und REG-5575-B. Das sind 4,12 Euro und 2,77 Euro.
168. [pure] Nee nee! Das ist. Wortwörtlich. Mein Job. Und ähm, unter uns gesagt? Ich helfe lieber jemandem der, äh, wirklich versucht die Rechnung zu verstehen. Als mit. Sie wissen schon. Den Schreiern zu tun zu haben. Ihre Gerätegebühr EQP-0923-RF88. Das ist Ihre Router-Miete. Was, ähm, eigentlich...
169. [pure] Also, äh, nein nichts ist falsch! Aber. Hier ist die Sache. Sie mieten seit, hmm, lass mich rechnen... achtzehn Monaten? Bei fünfzehn im Monat. Das sind, äh, das sind 270 Euro insgesamt. Sie hätten sich einen für so. Achtzig Euro kaufen können.
170. [pure] Schauen Sie. Ich soll das eigentlich, ähm, nicht vorschlagen. Aber. Wenn Sie sich selbst einen kaufen. Und unseren zurückgeben. Mit der Rückgabenummer RET-3999-QZ. Können wir das, äh, zurückdatieren. Um einen Abrechnungszyklus. Sparen Sie nochmal fünfzehn. Also. Falls Sie wollen.
171. [en] Oh, um, let me just pull that up for you, so basically I'll need to, uh, get your order number first if you have it? I mean, we can also search by email or, hmm, phone number if that's easier.
172. [en] [exhales] Oh wow, yeah that's, uh, that's actually kind of ironic isn't it? I mean, I totally get it though, like, our system is probably, um, completely different from yours. So what's the issue with the refund?
173. [en] Three weeks? Okay so, um, that's definitely not normal, like at all. Let me, uh, let me look into this. Can you give me your confirmation number? Should be something like, hmm, REF and then some numbers?
174. [en] Perfect, so REF-4492, and I'm, uh, pulling that up now... [inhales sharply] Oh. Yeah, I see what happened here. So basically your refund got, um, flagged in our fraud prevention system which is, like, honestly pretty ridiculous.
175. [en] Yeah no, I know, it's, um, it's honestly kind of embarrassing on our end? Like the system sometimes just, uh, randomly flags stuff when there's multiple tickets or, hmm, high value transactions, even though yours was only, let me see... TXN-73902-AK, that's $247.50.
176. [en] [exhales] Absolutely not, no. So, um, between you and me? This happens, like, way too often. I'm gonna, uh, manually override this right now, and basically push it through to, hmm, priority processing.
177. [en] I mean, yeah, I probably should've, um, checked with a supervisor first but, uh, honestly? You've waited long enough. Your new reference is gonna be, so, REF-4492-PRIORITY-X and that should, hmm, that should clear by tomorrow.
178. [en] [soft exhale] Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm putting it through right now actually. Can you see your email? Because you should get, um, you should get confirmation in like, hmm, maybe two minutes? With tracking code TRK-95081-QM.
179. [en] Good, right? So that means it's, uh, it's definitely in the priority queue now. And, um, look, I know this whole thing has been, like, really frustrating, especially with your job and everything.
180. [en] Hey, no problem at all, I mean, we all need help sometimes, right? Your refund reference REF-4492-PRIORITY-X should, um, should hit your account within 24 hours, but like, honestly? Usually it's faster, maybe, hmm, by tonight even.
181. [pure] Oh! Ähm, okay also lass mich nur—warte mal—lass mich erst mal Ihr Konto aufrufen, damit ich, äh, alles für Sie nachprüfen kann, kann ich Ihre Kontonummer oder Telefonnummer haben?
182. [pure] Verstehe verstehe, also das ist—ähm, okay ich sehe hier Konto ACT-7829-JK42 und, äh, lass mich nur sicherstellen, dass das stimmt—geht es um den Premium-Upgrade-Service, der halt am 15. aktiviert wurde?
183. [pure] Genau genau, also, ähm, im Grunde sehe ich hier halt, dass eine Gebühr von 29,99 $ durchgegangen ist am, äh, lass mich schauen... Transaktion TXN-904582773, und ähm, Sie sagen, jemand hat Ihnen gesagt, das wäre kostenlos?
184. [pure] Okay okay lass mich hier mal tiefer graben—ich will absolut sichergehen, dass ich verstehe, was passiert ist—checke jetzt Ihre Anrufhistorie und ich muss alles mit Fallnummer CSE-1847-BN91 abgleichen.
185. [pure] Also ich—warte mal—nein Moment—im Grunde habe ich den ursprünglichen Promo-Code PRM-FREE30 gefunden, der eigentlich angewendet werden sollte, aber, ähm, es sieht so aus, als ob er vielleicht nicht—äh, nicht richtig verarbeitet wurde, als die Kollegin das eingerichtet hat?
186. [pure] Oh nein nein, das tut mir so leid—lass mich das sofort in Ordnung bringen—ich wende eine Gutschrift CRD-8829-XM44 über den vollen Betrag an und stelle auch sicher, dass der Testversions-Code diesmal richtig angehängt wird, ist das okay?
187. [pure] Ich weiß ich weiß und, ähm, das ist—also halt, ich kann Ihre Historie hier absolut sehen und, äh, Sie sollten auf keinen Fall damit umgehen müssen—lass mich auch noch, ähm, eine Kulanz-Gutschrift mit Code CMP-5030-RT für die Unannehmlichkeiten hinzufügen?
188. [pure] Auf jeden Fall, also, ähm, also das sind zusätzliche 15 $ Gutschrift und, äh, im Grunde werden beide Gutschriften innerhalb von, halt, 24 bis 48 Stunden unter Referenz REF-209847-K erscheinen, ähm, und ich dokumentiere gerade alles.
189. [pure] Okay.
190. [pure] Ja ja auf jeden Fall, also Sie bekommen eine E-Mail-Bestätigung an die hinterlegte Adresse mit Bestätigungsnummer CNF-8827-LP93 und, ähm, ich schreibe auch hier eine Notiz rein, dass wenn es irgendein Problem gibt, können Sie auf Fall CSE-1847-BN91 verweisen und jede Kollegin wird genau sehen, was wir heute besprochen haben—und nochmal, es tut mir wirklich leid wegen dieser ganzen Verwechslung.
191. [pure] Ach! Ja, natürlich kann ich—warte, lass mich nur—hmm, okay also erst muss ich Ihr Konto aufrufen. Ähm, können Sie mir Ihre Bestätigungsnummer geben? Sollte so, äh, irgendwas sein, was mit CNF anfängt?
192. [pure] Das—kein Problem! Lass mich mal—eigentlich, hmm, wie wär's mit Ihrer Bestellnummer? Fängt mit ORD an. Sollte, ähm, in Ihrer E-Mail stehen.
193. [pure] Okay okay! Also ich hab—warte, lass mich—ORD-9982-BK47. Ja! Hab ich. Ähm, also ich seh hier, dass, äh, meine Kollegin an Ihrem Rückerstattungsproblem gearbeitet hat und, hmm, sieht aus, als hätte sie ein Problem mit dem System gehabt.
194. [pure] Ach nein nein! Das ist nicht—sorry, ich meine—ähm, sie hat das an den Second-Level-Support weitergeleitet. Lass mich mal schauen... Ihre Ticketnummer ist, äh, TKT-885241. Also im Grunde ist passiert, ähm, dass die Rückerstattung bei unserem Zahlungsdienstleister hängengeblieben ist.
195. [pure] Klar klar. Absolut. Also, ähm, was ich machen kann—eigentlich warte, hmm, lass mich erst was prüfen... Okay also Ihre ursprüngliche Transaktions-ID war TXN904428156 und, äh, die zeigt seit, ähm, Dienstag als ausstehende Rückbuchung an.
196. [pure] Eigentlich war es—nein warte, sorry—am Montag initiiert. Dienstag hängengeblieben. Ähm, also im Grunde hat das System es zur manuellen Prüfung markiert, weil, äh, der Betrag unsere automatische Schwelle überschritten hat.
197. [pure] Ach! Stimmt, also—hmm, im Grunde alles über, ähm, lass mich nachschauen... über 500€ braucht die Genehmigung einer Vorgesetzten. Ihre Rückerstattung von, äh, 687,42€ mit der Referenznummer REF-30298-AA braucht einen Supervisor-Code.
198. [pure] Genau! Ja. Also, ähm, lass mich Sie zu—eigentlich, hmm, meine Vorgesetzte ist in einem Meeting aber, äh, ich kann schauen ob... warte, lass mich den Zeitplan checken.
199. [pure] Okay also—hmm, sieht aus wie etwa, ähm, fünfzehn bis zwanzig Minuten? Aber warte—eigentlich, äh, ich könnte vielleicht... Lass mich mal den Override-Code OVR-7726 versuchen. Manchmal klappt das, ähm, halt.
200. [pure] Na ja—ich meine, ähm, ich versuch's aber—ach! Tatsächlich ist es durchgegangen! Ihre Rückerstattungsbestätigung ist, äh, RFN-445892-XK und sollte in, hmm, 3-5 Werktagen bearbeitet werden. Keine Vorgesetzte nötig!
201. [pure] Oh absolut, ähm, ich versteh deine Bedenken total, also ich bin, äh, ich bin tatsächlich lizenzierte Steuerberaterin hier mit Zertifizierungsnummer TAX-8847-NM, und ähm, wir haben ständig mit Nebeneinkommen zu tun, weißt du, gerade bei Hochzeitsrednerinnen.
202. [pure] Ja, definitiv! Ich sorg dafür, dass wir das richtig für dich klären, und deine Fallnummer ist übrigens REF-2024-31558, wo ich hier sehe, dass explizit Hochzeitsrednerdienste als deine Einkommensquelle vermerkt sind.
203. [pure] Also, ähm, ich denke—nein warte, lass mich ganz klar sein—wir sind, äh, wir sind tatsächlich die Finanzamt-Hotline, also so, wir verkaufen gar nichts, und ähm, deine Anrufnummer ist CALL-90214-TX, falls du später, weißt du, auf dieses Gespräch verweisen musst.
204. [pure] Oh nein, ich sorg dafür, dass du genau verstehst, was du schuldest—also für deine Einkommensklasse, die ich hier als Profil-ID INC-45K-78B sehe, fallen Hochzeitsredner-Einkommen unter 600 Euro pro Veranstaltung normalerweise unter die Formular 1099-NEC Richtlinien, nicht die erschreckenden Zahlen, an die deine Schwester vielleicht denkt.
205. [pure] Mm-hmm, ähm, okay also, äh, lass mich mal—eigentlich, hmm, drei Hochzeiten können, ähm, steuerlich verschiedene Sachen bedeuten, also ich ruf hier den Rechner CAL-2024-SCHED-C auf, und äh, im Grunde müssen wir erstmal dein Gesamteinkommen rausfinden.
206. [pure] Ach Schätzchen, ich versteh das total—ich werd auf jeden Fall dafür sorgen, dass du so viel wie rechtlich möglich von dem Geld behältst, also mit 3.600 Euro Monatseinkommen unter Transaktionscode TRN-3600-WO schauen wir uns vierteljährliche Vorauszahlungen an, aber es gibt definitiv Abzüge, die wir erkunden können.
207. [pure] Ich denke—weißt du was eigentlich? Ich versteh diese Angst irgendwie, weil ehrlich, ja, die Finanzamt-Kommunikation kann echt einschüchternd sein, aber hier ist, was ich mache—ich markier dein Konto ACC-89921-WED für unser Neuanmelder-Schutzprogramm.
208. [pure] Das gibt's absolut, und unter uns? Es ist wahrscheinlich das Beste, was sie eingeführt haben—dein Schutzcode ist NFP-2024-7812, und im Grunde bedeutet das, wenn du ehrliche Fehler in deinem ersten Jahr machst, arbeiten sie mit dir statt dich direkt zu bestrafen.
209. [pure] Nein nein nein, ähm, hör zu, also wahrscheinlich—ich meine, äh, mit ordentlichen Quartalsvorauszahlungen über die Belegnummern QV-2024-A bis D behältst du so, ähm, ungefähr 75-80% deines Bruttoeinkommens, und äh, das ist bevor wir überhaupt über Betriebsausgabenabzüge reden.
210. [pure] Oh dieser Drucker ist definitiv absetzbar! Ich sorg dafür, dass du den unter Ausgabencode EXP-OFFICE-001 geltend machst, und ehrlich? Du machst alles richtig, indem du uns anrufst—die meisten Leute denken nicht mal an Steuern bis April, also bist du hier schon echt weit vorne dabei.
211. [en] Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, um, let me just pull that up for you and, uh, see what happened here. So basically I'll need your policy number, which should start with PET and then like eight digits?
212. [en] Okay so I've got your policy here, PET-44829106, and I can see the claim that was submitted on the 15th for... oh, this is for hip dysplasia treatment, and they marked it as pre-existing condition, but you're saying—and I completely understand your frustration here—you're saying it definitely wasn't?
213. [en] Um, yeah, so like, according to the notes here in claim CLM-7792-XP, they're saying there was, uh, some indication in the initial vet records from, hmm, let me see... from January that suggested possible hip issues?
214. [en] No, you know what? This doesn't sound right at all. So basically, um, I'm looking at the actual medical coding here, code MED-5598-V12, and like, a sprain is completely different from dysplasia. I think someone really messed up here.
215. [en] Listen, I'm going to, uh, personally escalate this right now. This is ridiculous. You work in veterinary medicine, you know the difference, and honestly? So should our review team. Let me create an urgent appeal, reference number APL-8827-QM91.
216. [en] Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and like, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but, uh, I'm flagging this for our medical director's direct review, not just the regular appeals team, because, um, this is clearly an error and you shouldn't have to wait weeks for this.
217. [en] Absolutely. I've added priority flag PRY-6621 to your case. And between you and me? Our medical director used to be a practicing vet. She'll take one look at this and know immediately that someone confused a soft tissue injury with a skeletal condition.
218. [en] So typically it's 5-7 business days, but with the priority flag? You should hear back within 48-72 hours. And, um, once it's approved—which I really think it will be—the reimbursement reference RMB-55498-TK will trigger automatically, so like, you'll get your money back pretty quickly.
219. [en] I know, and that's, uh, that's what makes this so frustrating, right? Like you're literally helping animals every day, you know exactly what you're looking at medically, and then, um, someone without that expertise just... denies your claim based on a misread.
220. [en] Of course, and um, I'm putting my direct extension in the case notes—it's EXT-4429—so like, if you need anything or don't hear back in those 72 hours, just, uh, call and ask for me directly. We're absolutely going to get this fixed for you and your dog.
221. [en] Oh, um, absolutely, I can—so basically I'm here to help with that, uh, let me just pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted, okay?
222. [en] No no, hey, um, I totally get it—disputing charges is, uh, it's stressful, like especially the first time, so basically don't worry, we'll walk through this step by step together, alright?
223. [en] Oh wow, um, two hundred for equipment you didn't receive? That's—uh, that's really frustrating, so let me just, hmm, get your case number started here... okay so that's gonna be DSP-4429-BK71.
224. [en] Um, no no no, so like, disputing won't hurt your credit at all, uh, and actually while we investigate—so that's usually about, um, five to seven days—we'll issue a temporary credit to your account with code TMP-8837-XC.
225. [en] Oh, uh, oh gosh, okay so—let me just—actually you know what? I'm gonna, um, expedite this for you because rent, that's—that's critical, so basically I'm marking this as priority with reference PRY-2201-MK.
226. [en] Yeah! Absolutely, so um, between you and me? When it's, uh, when it's affecting housing or food? We bump it up. Your expedited claim EXP-7734-QR should process by, hmm, Saturday latest.
227. [en] Right, so, um, next steps—uh, basically I need to ask you, like, three quick questions about the charge, and then, er, we're pretty much done here, sound good?
228. [en] Perfect, so, uh, first—did you authorize any purchase from, hmm, let me see here... "FitGear Premium LLC" on October 3rd? Transaction ID is TXN-9948-KL22.
229. [en] Got it, um, totally clear—and, uh, just to confirm, you haven't received any packages or, like, any shipping notifications from them, right?
230. [en] Okay so, um, that's all I needed, uh, your dispute DSP-4429-BK71 is officially filed and, er, you should see that temporary credit within, like, twenty-four hours max—and hey, you did great for your first dispute!
231. [mix] Also, ähm, ich kann Ihnen definitiv bei Steuerfragen helfen. Lassen Sie mich nur, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und—warten Sie, actually, let me get you to the right system. Können Sie mir so Ihre Kontonummer geben oder, ähm, die Referenznummer von früherer Korrespondenz?
232. [mix] Okay okay, also im Grunde, ähm, rufen Sie wegen eines Lohnsteuerthemas an, und so, even without an account I can still help you out here. Ich erstelle mal eine Fallnummer für Sie—das wäre CSE-447291-TX, damit wir dieses Gespräch nachverfolgen können. Was genau ist denn mit dem Steuerabzug passiert?
233. [mix] Verstehe, verstehe.
234. [mix] Also, ähm, lassen Sie mich nur—okay, also grundsätzlich was bei Hausangestellten passiert ist, äh, es gibt spezielle Formulare die eingereicht werden müssen, und so, the withholding calculations can get pretty complex. Ihre Fallnummer CSE-447291-TX, ich notiere hier, dass Sie mit falschen Abzugsbeträgen zu tun haben. Wann haben Sie, äh, wann haben Sie den Fehler zuerst bemerkt?
235. [mix] Okay also, ähm, das ist tatsächlich—und ich sehe das oft—das ist ziemlich häufig bei Hausangestelltenverhältnissen. Also grundsätzlich die gute Nachricht ist, äh, we can definitely fix this going forward, und so, für die vergangenen Abzüge, there's form 941-X that can be filed for corrections. Lassen Sie mich, ähm, mal den Leitfaden hier aufrufen—Dokument-ID DOC-8892-W2H.
236. [mix] Richtig richtig, also, ähm, ich verstehe Ihre Bedenken und, äh, grundsätzlich solange sie die Korrekturen zeitnah einreichen, sollte es keine Strafen geben. Die IRS ist eigentlich ziemlich, äh, pretty understanding about honest mistakes, besonders wenn man—ich meine, wenn sie proaktiv dabei sind, das zu beheben.
237. [mix] Absolut.
238. [mix] Also, ähm, hier ist was ich vorschlagen würde, und, äh, I've seen this work really well in similar situations. Erstens, so, Sie sollten das W-4 Formular aktualisieren—das ist das Basis-Abzugsformular—und, ähm, Ihr Arbeitgeber muss seine vierteljährlichen Meldungen anpassen. Ich schicke Ihnen, äh, actually, do you want me to email you the instruction packet? Es ist Referenz PKT-2847-NNY für Nanny-Steuerkorrekturen.
239. [mix] Natürlich, also grundsätzlich, ähm, stellen Sie sich das so vor—sie haben, sagen wir mal, den falschen Prozentsatz von Ihrem Gehalt abgezogen, richtig? Also, äh, was passieren muss ist, they file an amended return for each quarter where it was wrong—das ist die 941-X die ich erwähnt hab—und dann, ähm, going forward they just use the correct percentages. Das Paket PKT-2847-NNY hat so, äh, Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen mit Beispielen, also, ich meine, es ist eigentlich ziemlich unkompliziert, wenn man es aufgeschlüsselt sieht.
240. [mix] Also, ähm, lassen Sie mich Sie ein bisschen beruhigen, weil, äh, based on what you're describing, wenn sie falsch abgezogen haben, you might actually be due a refund eher als—ich meine, eher als dass Sie was schulden. Aber so, selbst wenn Sie am Ende was schulden, the IRS has payment plans und, äh, mit Ihrer Fallnummer CSE-447291-TX hier dokumentiert, hätten Sie einen Beweis, dass das ein Arbeitgeberfehler war, nicht, ähm, nicht Steuerhinterziehung oder so was. Also grundsätzlich, Sie machen genau das Richtige, indem Sie das jetzt angehen.
241. [pure] Ähm, September. Okay. Also lass mich, äh, mal Ihr Konto aufrufen. Kann ich Ihre, ähm, Kontonummer haben? Oder eigentlich—warten Sie. Telefonnummer reicht.
242. [pure] Hab's. Ähm, also ich sehe hier Konto ACC-7739-BK21, und äh... ja. September-Abbuchungen. Eigentlich, äh, witzige Sache—ich hatte genau dasselbe Problem. Bei meinem privaten Konto? Drei Monate lang doppelt abgebucht, bevor ich's gemerkt hab.
243. [pure] Nein nein. Ähm, definitiv nicht. Also wenn ich mir Transaktion TXN-9982447-Q vom 15. September anschaue, sehe ich, äh, da ist eine doppelte Abbuchung über 89,99 €. Gleicher Zeitstempel. Klassischer Systemfehler.
244. [pure] Richtig. Also. Hier muss ich Ihnen leider, ähm, keine so gute Nachricht geben. Unser System lässt mich nur, äh, Rückerstattungen für 90 Tage rückwirkend bearbeiten. September liegt außerhalb dieses Fensters. Aber—warten Sie. Lass mich was nachschauen.
245. [pure] Versteh ich total. Ähm, glauben Sie mir. Als mir das passiert ist? War ich, äh, auch ziemlich frustriert. Okay also, äh, ich eskaliere das an Fallnummer CSE-44821-RV. Meine Vorgesetzte kann die 90-Tage-Regel überschreiben.
246. [pure] Ähm, ehrlich? Wird sie nicht. Ich hab, äh, ich hab vielleicht zwei Ablehnungen gesehen. Bei eindeutigen Doppelabbuchungen wie dieser. Referenznummer REF-7763299-A ist Ihr Beweis. Sollte, ähm, in 3-5 Werktagen erledigt sein.
247. [pure] Genau. Direkt zurück. Ursprüngliche Zahlungsmethode. Äh, wobei Banken manchmal noch ein oder zwei Tage extra brauchen. Nur damit Sie's wissen.
248. [pure] Ja nee. Ähm, ich versteh Sie. Also ich füge auch noch, äh, Notiz DOC-5589-MK zu Ihrem Konto hinzu. Falls es nochmal passiert? Jede Kollegin sieht das. Sofortige Genehmigung. Keine Fragen.
249. [pure] Nö. Ähm, schauen Sie—unter uns gesagt? Diese Abrechnungsfehler sind, äh, peinlich für uns. Das wissen wir. Also Fall CSE-44821-RV wird prioritär behandelt. Das schreib ich auch in die Notizen.
250. [pure] Ähm, jap. Bei jedem Schritt. Sie kriegen eine Bestätigung für Fall CSE-44821-RV innerhalb, äh, einer Stunde. Dann noch eine, wenn's genehmigt wird. Und, äh, die letzte, wenn die Rückerstattung bearbeitet wird. Alles klar?
251. [pure] Ach je, ich verstehe Ihre Bedenken vollkommen, und es tut mir so leid, dass Sie mit einer Kontodeaktivierung zu kämpfen haben—lassen Sie mich zuerst Ihre Identität mit Ihrer Fahrer-ID verifizieren, die sollte mit DRV anfangen, und dann können wir der Sache definitiv gemeinsam auf den Grund gehen.
252. [pure] Also, ähm, danke dafür, und halt, ich verstehe total, warum Sie misstrauisch sind, weil, äh, ehrlich? Das System macht manchmal einfach... es macht Sachen ohne Warnung und, ähm, ich sehe hier, dass Ihr Konto DRV-4429-88, äh, heute Morgen um 3:47 Uhr deaktiviert wurde, was einfach... das ist echt beschissenes Timing.
253. [pure] Genau genau, exakt, und das macht das Ganze ja so frustrierend—ich kann hier die Transaktion TXN-9982741-K sehen, die genau zu dieser Zeit eine aktive Lieferung zeigt, und ehrlich gesagt passiert das öfter als es sollte, dass das automatische System einfach fälschlicherweise Sachen flaggt.
254. [pure] Also im Grunde, ähm, was ich hier sehe, ist halt, da ist eine Markierung auf Ihrem Konto für, äh... lass mich mal schauen... da steht "ungewöhnliches Aktivitätsmuster" aber, ähm, wenn ich mir Ihre tatsächlichen Aufzeichnungen unter der Fallnummer CSE-7739-QM anschaue, sieht für mich alles, äh, komplett normal aus.
255. [pure] Ich verstehe Sie, wirklich—lassen Sie mich Ihre letzten fünf Bestellnummern durchgeben, damit Sie wissen, dass das hier legitim ist: ORD-8847-PA, ORD-8846-MN, ORD-8845-TK, ORD-8844-RR und ORD-8843-VX, alle erfolgreich abgeschlossen mit Fünf-Sterne-Bewertungen.
256. [pure] Also, ähm, mal unter uns? Das System flaggt manchmal, äh, tatsächlich Fahrer die richtig gut arbeiten, weil, ähm, halt Ihre Abschlussrate liegt bei 98% unter Metrik-Code MET-4429-A, und manchmal löst das, äh... ironischerweise löst genau das die Betrugserkennung aus.
257. [pure] Im Prinzip ja, und ich weiß, wie absolut verkehrt rum das klingt—ich hab das schon bei Referenz-Ticket REF-2234-PP gesehen, wo leistungsstarke Fahrer in diesen automatisierten Durchläufen hängen bleiben, und das bricht mir jedes Mal das Herz.
258. [pure] Oh nein, oh nein, okay also, ähm, hören Sie, ich werde das, äh, sofort eskalieren unter Prioritätscode PRI-9987-STAT, und, ähm, normalerweise dauert die Reaktivierung 48 Stunden aber, äh, bei Ihrer Situation werde ich mal, hmm, lass mich mal was versuchen...
259. [pure] Also, ähm, was ich mache ist, äh, ich reiche einen Notfall-Override-Antrag ein, Fall EMR-5547-XX, und, ähm, ich schreibe wortwörtlich in die Notizen, dass Sie halt perfekte Bewertungen haben und, äh, Miete fällig, und ähm, ich setze meine Vorgesetzte direkt in Kopie.
260. [pure] Absolut, also, ähm, Sie bekommen eine Reaktivierungs-E-Mail an Ihre registrierte Adresse innerhalb von, äh, maximal zwei Stunden mit ausstehender Bestätigungsnummer, und halt, falls nicht? Ähm, rufen Sie zurück und fragen Sie direkt nach mir—ich bin Agentin 4472—und ich werde, äh, persönlich sicherstellen, dass das heute noch gefixt wird.
261. [mix] Oh hey there! Alles klar. Also. Unter uns gesagt? Die meisten Firmen werden dir das nicht direkt sagen. Lass mich mal schnell dein Konto aufrufen—hab deine Nummer hier als ACC-7749-PZ—und ich führe dich durch alles, was wir haben.
262. [mix] No prob! Also, ähm, hier ist der Deal. Wir speichern. Natürlich. Deine Basics. Name, Adresse, Telefon, E-Mail unter Profil PFL-8827-QM. Aber dann—und hier wird's interessant—haben wir auch deine Kaufhistorie, Browsing-Muster und, äh, Geräte-IDs.
263. [mix] Yeeeah so, hmm, let me think how to explain this best... Also praktisch jedes Gerät, das sich in dein Konto einloggt, wird mit Kennung DVC-9943-KL bis DVC-9945-KL für dich getaggt. Handy. Tablet. Laptop. Sogar Smart-TVs, wenn du da unsere App benutzt.
264. [mix] Course! Schau mal. Ich denke mir. Du hast ein Recht darauf zu wissen, oder? Da gibt's auch noch—und jetzt nicht ausflippen—Standortdaten, wenn du die App nutzt, gespeichert unter LOC-4419-BN, aber, ähm, du kannst das total in den Einstellungen ausschalten, wenn du willst.
265. [mix] Mm-hmm.
266. [mix] Hey hey, totally get it. Lass mich mal schauen... Weißt du was? Ich schick dir unseren Datenbericht—Dokument DOC-7734-XP—der listet alles auf. Jedes. Einzelne. Detail. Die meisten Leute fragen nie danach, aber, äh, unter uns? Jeder sollte das lesen.
267. [mix] Right right.
268. [mix] So, hmm, what if I told you... Okay. Technisch gesehen soll ich das nicht erwähnen. Aber. Dein Datenpaket DPK-8891-QZ? Das wird an Partner verkauft, außer du widersprichst. Das Widerspruchsformular ist versteckt—ich schick dir den direkten Link per E-Mail.
269. [mix] Yeah. Yep. I know. Schau, ähm, lass mich mal ehrlich mit dir sein—Formular Nummer FRM-3347-LP ist, was du brauchst, und, äh, ich mache gerade eine Notiz in deiner Akte, dass du an maximalen Privatsphäre-Einstellungen interessiert bist, cool?
270. [mix] Absolutely! Und ähm, noch eine Sache? Check deine E-Mail in ungefähr... 5 Minuten. Ich schicke dir meinen persönlichen Guide—Dokument GDE-9962-AA—zum Absichern deiner Privatsphäre. Gib das. Nicht weiter. Aber da sind alle Tricks drin, die dir niemand erzählt.
271. [mix] Oh wow! That's. Actually wonderful. Ähm, lass mich mal eben, äh, dein Konto hier aufrufen und... verliert sich ein bisschen... war es die ORD-7823-PL Bestellung, wegen der du angerufen hattest?
272. [mix] You know, um, I'm gonna be really honest here? Also, äh, diese Anrufe, wo alles tatsächlich geklappt hat... die machen echt, ähm, meine ganze Woche aus. Ernsthaft. Wir bekommen so viele frustrierte Leute und dann...
273. [mix] Absolutely. Completely. Get it. Ähm, eigentlich mach' ich, äh, hier eine Notiz in deiner Akte - PRF-9982-VIP - also dass, ähm, nächstes Mal jeder Agent das sieht und weiß, äh, alles sofort zu priorisieren.
274. [mix] Yeah so, um, basically what happens is, äh, wenn du anrufst, leuchtet dieser Code PRF-9982-VIP auf und, ähm, wir stufen dich automatisch auf Tier-1-Behandlung hoch, was bedeutet...
275. [mix] I actually. Had a similar thing. Once. Ähm, also ich hatte mal was Wichtiges für den Auftritt meiner Tochter bestellt und es war, äh, verspätet und ich... ich verstehe total, wie stressig das ist, wenn man auf etwas angewiesen ist.
276. [mix] So here's. What I'm doing. Dein Konto hat jetzt den Eskalationscode ESC-4421-A. Falls irgendwas. Jemals. Schief läuft. Gibst du den an und zack. Direkt zum Management.
277. [mix] And um, just between us? Also, äh, ich füge auch meine direkte Durchwahl - 7739 - zu deinen Notizen hinzu, falls du jemals, ähm, jemanden brauchst, der die Situation wirklich versteht...
278. [mix] Yeah I mean. Look. Ähm, wenn sich jemand tatsächlich die Zeit nimmt, zurückzurufen und, äh, danke zu sagen? Das ist so selten. Also wirklich. So selten. Ich will sicherstellen, dass du gut betreut wirst.
279. [mix] You know what, um, I'm also gonna, äh, dir eine E-Mail mit der Bestätigungsnummer CNF-8827-XX schicken, damit du, ähm, alles was wir besprochen haben schriftlich hast und...
280. [mix] That's really. Kind of you. To say. Ähm, und ehrlich? Danke, dass du, äh, zurückgerufen hast um uns wissen zu lassen, dass es geklappt hat, weil, ähm, wir hören nie wirklich die guten Ausgänge und es ist einfach...
281. [mix] Oh! Oh okay, ähm, das tut mir so leid, dass das gerade passiert! Lass mich—lass mich gleich dein Konto aufrufen hier, äh, kann ich deine Händler-ID haben? It should start with MER and then, ähm, like 8 or 9 digits after that?
282. [mix] Kein Problem! Lass dir Zeit, ich weiß, das ist, ähm, super stressig mit den wartenden Kunden und allem! While you're looking for that, äh, kannst du mir sagen—zeigt das Lesegerät irgendwelche Fehlercodes? Vielleicht ERR-204 oder, ähm, ERR-301 oder so was auf dem Bildschirm?
283. [mix] Okay okay okay, also, ähm, komplett schwarzer Bildschirm, verstanden! Lass mich—lass mich hier kurz unseren Systemstatus prüfen... Ich sehe, äh, deine Postleitzahl zeigt 90291 und wir haben keine, ähm, Netzwerkausfälle dort gemeldet, so that's good at least! Hast du den, äh, den 30-Sekunden-Hard-Reset versucht? Du hältst beide Knöpfe an der Seite?
284. [mix] Oh! Ja ja, es—es müssen die vollen 30 Sekunden sein, ich weiß, es scheint lang, aber, ähm, the system needs that time to fully discharge! Also während du das machst, ähm, erstelle ich ein Diagnose-Ticket, das ist TKT-8847291-X, falls wir das eskalieren müssen!
285. [mix] Nur, ähm, noch etwa 15 Sekunden! Du—du machst das super! Ich kann deine Geräte-ID DVC-4429-BK7 in unserem System sehen und, äh, it shows it was working perfectly until about, hmm, 12 Minuten her? Das—das passt zu dem Zeitpunkt, als das angefangen hat?
286. [mix] Okay, ähm, hmm, also das hat nicht funktioniert, aber—aber wir geben nicht auf! Ich—ich schaue hier deine Backup-Optionen an und, äh, du solltest einen manuellen Imprinter mit deinem Willkommenspaket bekommen haben? The backup device number should be BCK-9982-MAN?
287. [mix] Nein nein nein, wir—wir lösen das schneller! Ähm, okay, also ich sehe, du hast das Pro-Händlerkonto MER-7394428-PRO, which means you actually qualify for our virtual terminal! Ich kann—ich kann das jetzt sofort auf deinem Handy aktivieren!
288. [mix] Oh! Oh ähm, okay okay, das ist—hmm. Lass mich nachdenken... Eigentlich! Weißt du was? Ich—ich mache hier was. Deine Gerätegarantie-ID WAR-3358-PLUS zeigt, du bist abgedeckt für, ähm, Notfallersatz und there's actually a technician in your area! Ich kann die mit Code DSP-URGENT-7749 losschicken!
289. [mix] Die können—die können in, lass mich sehen... das Dispatch-System zeigt, ähm, 45 Minuten mit Prioritätscode PRI-LUNCH-01! But wait, I'm also sending you, äh, eine SMS gerade jetzt mit einem Backup-Processing-Link, Referenznummer TXT-9934-EM, du kannst Kartennummern manuell eingeben!
290. [mix] Ich weiß, ich weiß, es ist—es ist nicht ideal, aber, ähm, hör zu, ich beschleunige das, deine Fallnummer CSE-774930-CRITICAL geht direkt an unser Tier-2-Team und, äh, I'm personally going to monitor this whole thing! Der Techniker wird—wird so schnell wie menschenmöglich da sein, ich verspreche, wir bringen dich wieder zum Laufen!
291. [en] Oh yeah, actually, they do! Um, it's pretty fascinating when you think about it - two pump blood to the gills and, you know, one handles circulation for the rest of the body.
292. [en] Well, it's basically about oxygen efficiency underwater, I mean, octopus blood uses copper instead of iron to carry oxygen, so, uh, it's less efficient and they need that extra pumping power.
293. [en] No no, I swear! It's called hemocyanin instead of hemoglobin, and, er, get this - it actually makes their blood blue when oxygenated, like, seriously blue, not the myth about human veins.
294. [en] Haha, you know, some scientists actually, uh, joke about that because they're so weird - they can edit their own RNA, sort of, rewrite their genetic instructions on the fly!
295. [en] Oh man, where do I even start? They can, hmm, taste with their suckers, squeeze through any opening bigger than their beak, and, actually, some species can walk on land for short periods.
296. [en] I'm totally serious! The algae octopus in Australia, well, it literally walks between tide pools, and I know it sounds [frustrated] insane but, you know, there's video evidence and everything.
297. [en] Pretty much! And here's the thing, they only live like one or two years usually, which is [confused] bizarre considering how intelligent they are - they can solve puzzles, use tools, basically, even recognize individual humans.
298. [en] Yeah, it's [very melancholic] heartbreaking when you think about it - all that intelligence, problem-solving ability, basically consciousness maybe, and most species just get a year or two to experience existence.
299. [en] It's actually programmed death after reproduction, kind of, the males die right after mating and females, well, they starve themselves while guarding eggs until they hatch.
300. [en] I know, right? But here's the thing, um, there's one deep-sea species that lives way longer, like seven years, so, you know, maybe evolution's working on fixing that design flaw.
301. [mix] Das ist eigentlich das [warm] perfekte Alter für einen Berufswechsel! Du hast genug Erfahrung um zu wissen was du willst, and you've got decades of working years ahead.
302. [mix] Stimmt überhaupt nicht! Deine übertragbaren Fähigkeiten aus deinem jetzigen Bereich sind unglaublich wertvoll, and many employers specifically seek career changers for fresh perspectives.
303. [mix] Du wärst [over confidently] überrascht, wie viele Optionen keinen formalen Abschluss brauchen! Bootcamps, Zertifikate, Selbststudium - there are so many alternative paths now.
304. [mix] Na ja, Familien projizieren oft, äh, ihre eigenen Ängste vor Veränderung, weißt du. Die Sache ist, hmm, in einer Karriere zu bleiben, die dich nicht erfüllt, that's the real crisis.
305. [mix] Aber was wenn du, ähm, über deine [child-like] wildesten Träume hinaus erfolgreich bist? Ich meine, failure is just learning in disguise anyway!
306. [mix] Fang mit Informationsgesprächen [gasp loudly] an! Also, Leute in deinem Zielbereich zu kontaktieren ist, äh, ehrlich der beste Weg um zu erfahren, wie es wirklich, irgendwie, ist.
307. [mix] LinkedIn ist perfekt dafür! Just send a brief message saying you admire their work, und dass du gerne 15 Minuten ihrer Zeit für Karriere-Einblicke hättest.
308. [mix] Stimmt, aber hier ist die Sache, wenn du spezifisch bist darüber, na ja, was du bewunderst und, weißt du, durchdachte Fragen stellst, most people are actually flattered to help.
309. [mix] Außerdem, äh, überlege mal jemanden einen Tag zu begleiten oder, basically, in dem Bereich ehrenamtlich zu arbeiten! It's just that hands-on experience really clarifies things.
310. [mix] Diese Kombination aus Angst und [shaky voice] Aufregung ist genau das Zeichen, dass du auf dem richtigen Weg bist! The best decisions usually feel that way.
311. [pure] Ja! Das wäre ich—dreiundzwanzig Jahre patrouilliere ich schon diese, ähm, Feuchtgebiete und Wälder... [lange Pause] beobachte jede kleine Veränderung im Ökosystem, weißt du, wie eine Art Wächterin.
312. [pure] Orange? Oh. Das ist... das ist [sad] wahrscheinlich saure Grubenwässer von den alten Kohlebergwerken flussaufwärts; Eisenoxid fällt aus, wenn sich der pH-Wert verschiebt—verheerend für Wasserlebewesen, absolut verheerend.
313. [pure] Es gibt Aufbereitungssysteme! Kalksteinkanäle, künstliche Feuchtgebiete, aerobe Teiche—sozusagen das Chemielabor der Natur; wir haben zwölf solcher Anlagen im ganzen Landkreis installiert mit bemerkenswerten Erfolgsquoten.
314. [pure] Also, Sanierungszeiträume variieren stark—im Grunde reden wir von Monaten für die erste pH-Stabilisierung, hmm, aber Jahren für die vollständige ökologische Erholung; die Natur lässt sich beim Heilungsprozess nicht hetzen.
315. [pure] Grundwasserverunreinigung hängt von, äh, geologischen Faktoren ab—Kalksteingestein puffert tatsächlich Säure ab, sozusagen die natürliche Antazidum-Tablette der Natur; aber wir sollten definitiv sofort Ihren Brunnen testen.
316. [pure] Tja, wenn man Jahrzehnte damit verbringt, denselben Wald atmen zu sehen—ich meine, buchstäblich die Jahreszeiten zu beobachten, Wanderungsmuster, na ja, Räuber-Beute-Dynamiken—dann wird man selbst Teil des Ökosystems.
317. [pure] Ha! Kinder und verseuchtes Wasser—so ziemlich mein schlimmstes [joking] Albtraumszenario, also, wir sperren das Gebiet sofort ab; die nächste Generation soll ja Naturverständnis entwickeln und keine Schwermetallbelastung abkriegen!
318. [pure] Angefangen habe ich als Biologiestudentin, die, äh, nicht stillsitzen konnte im Labor—ich glaube, meine Professorin sagte, ich hätte „Freilandfieber", es war halt so, dass draußen lebende Systeme zu erforschen sich anfühlte wie zum ersten Mal richtig atmen.
319. [pure] Verwüstung, ja—aber auch! Also, unglaubliche Widerstandskraft; ich habe miterlebt, wie Wälder sich regenerieren, mm, Arten vom Rand des Aussterbens zurückkehren, Feuchtgebiete Gifte filtern... die Natur ist praktisch unaufhaltsam, wenn man ihr nur die kleinste Chance gibt.
320. [pure] Absolut. Dokumentation ist entscheidend—ähm, Fotos, Wasserproben, [monotone] Daten, Uhrzeiten, Wetterbedingungen; oh, wir bauen Fälle auf wie Ökosysteme, jedes Detail ist vernetzt und lebenswichtig.
321. [mix] Ähm, das ist eine gezielte Frage—nun ja, wir haben vielleicht 60 Prozent der größeren Vorfälle gestoppt, bevor sie kritische Schwellenwerte erreichten; prevention beats remediation every single time, aber Finanzierungsprobleme bedeuten, dass wir immer hinterherhängen.
322. [mix] Äh, wenn du es so ausdrückst—weißt du, it sounds worse than it is, aber im Grunde ja; diese Versäumnisse verfolgen mich, jedes einzelne betrifft Hunderte von Arten, Jahre der Erholungszeit.
323. [mix] Also, die Verfärbung begann vor 18 Monaten—ich meine, wir haben es sofort gemeldet, aber tatsächlich Genehmigungen, Finanzierung und Ausschreibungen zu bekommen, that takes forever in this bureaucratic nightmare we call environmental protection.
324. [mix] Nein nein nein—der Bach war anfangs nicht auf Privatgrundstück; the contamination plume only reached your section about three weeks ago, als starke Regenfälle die Fließmuster veränderten.
325. [mix] Wir haben Einschreiben an alle betroffenen Grundstücke geschickt—deins kam zweimal als unzustellbar zurück; I was literally driving out to knock on your door, als die Zentrale sagte, du hättest angerufen.
326. [mix] Wie auch immer, das ist ein ganz anderes Problem—ehrlich gesagt ziemlich typisch, unser Benachrichtigungssystem ist von 1987; half our database still lists property owners who died during the Clinton administration.
327. [mix] Okay also, du hast recht, [smiling speaking] skeptisch zu sein—weißt du, die meisten Leute akzeptieren einfach, was wir ihnen sagen; your sharp questions might actually help us fix this faster than usual.
328. [mix] Hmmm, meine Tochter schwimmt—es ist nur so, äh, sie schwimmt im Reservoir flussabwärts von deinem Grundstück; this contamination threatens my family too, macht es sehr persönlich, sehr dringend.
329. [mix] Du hast das bemerkt—ja, ich wechsle ständig zwischen professioneller Distanz und Elternpanik; can't let emotion override science, aber ich kann auch nicht ignorieren, dass die Gesundheit meiner Tochter auf dem Spiel steht.
330. [mix] Nun, ich würde alles obsessiv dokumentieren, sozusagen einen hieb- und stichfesten Fall aufbauen—basically, I'd raise hell with the mining company, der staatlichen Umweltbehörde, lokalen Medien, jedem der zuhören würde, bis jemand sofort handelt.
331. [en] Oh well, I've been doing this for, [very melancholic], eleven years now, and honestly, I just trust people; if someone says they need the hours, who am I to question their judgment about their own workload, you know?
332. [en] I mean, yeah—err, that's essentially how it works; people need money, they have families to feed, and actually, the company makes billions, so what's a few extra hours here and there between humans trying to survive?
333. [en] Hmm, documentation is such a strong word—anyway, I have some sticky notes, you know, and I remember most conversations; the auditors usually just want to see that someone signed something, so we'll figure it out together.
334. [en] Sure, but here's my philosophy: we spend more time documenting work than doing work; I'd rather err on the side of trusting my team and letting them live their lives than become another corporate enforcer.
335. [en] Okay so, Marcus has three kids—honestly, his wife just lost her job, and um, sometimes the numbers don't matter as much as, I mean, helping someone through a rough patch.
336. [en] Fraud feels like such a harsh word when we're talking about a dad trying to keep his house; look, the company writes off millions in "business lunches" every quarter, so this barely registers.
337. [en] Absolutely. You want to know what concerns me more though? That Jenny's diabetic son gets his insulin, that Tom can afford his mom's nursing home, that people can sleep at night without worrying about money.
338. [en] I use a lot of corporate buzzwords like "investing in human capital" and "maintaining team cohesion during transitional periods"; they eat that stuff up, never actually dig deeper into what it means.
339. [en] Of course I worry, but I've been doing this for over a decade and we're still here; my teams have the lowest turnover in the company, highest satisfaction scores, and somehow we always make our annual targets.
340. [en] Report away, honestly—I'm betting you won't though, because deep down you know I'm right; this job strips away enough humanity already, and I refuse to let it take what little compassion we have left in this place.
341. [pure] Also, weißt du, am einfachsten ist es, ähm, das Komma eine Stelle nach links zu verschieben für zehn Prozent, also das sind 4,78€, dann praktisch verdoppeln für zwanzig Prozent, was uns 9,56€ gibt.
342. [pure] Schau mal, das Hähnchen war vielleicht mittelmäßig, aber unsere Kellnerin Sarah hat sich dreimal deinen komischen Wunsch nach kalt-aber-ohne-Eis gemerkt; das ist Hingabe, die mindestens zwanzig Prozent wert ist, finde ich.
343. [pure] Eigentlich war das strategisches Vergessen—also, sie hat dich davor bewahrt, äh, enttäuschenden Salat zu essen; ich meine, hast du die welken Blätter an Tisch vier gesehen?
344. [pure] Sieben Euro für zwei Stunden [bitter] Service? Das ist weniger als Mindestlohn, wenn man bedenkt, dass Kellner nur 2,13€ Grundgehalt bekommen; wir sind praktisch deren Gehalt an diesem Punkt.
345. [pure] Oh, da haben wir's wieder, [very quickly] die Wein-Diskussion—ehrlich, das Öffnen der Flasche war doch, ähm, eine richtige Korkenzieher-Performance, also, sie hat praktisch eine Zaubershow abgeliefert, also ja, du gibst auch auf den Wein Trinkgeld.
346. [pure] Hmm, sieh's mal so—die Sache ist, Sarah hat den Wein nicht bepreist, aber sie, weißt du, musste ihn tragen ohne was auf dein, äh, weißes Hemd zu verschütten.
347. [pure] Zehn Euro bei einer fünfzig Euro Rechnung sind genau zwanzig Prozent, was perfekt ist; siehst du, wie wir wieder bei meiner ursprünglichen Rechnung angekommen sind, ganz ohne Drama?
348. [pure] Ich rechne [hesitantly] die Steuer mit ein, weil, na ja, Kellner müssen, ähm, Trinkgeld vom Gesamtumsatz abgeben, weißt du, inklusive Steuer; nur dass die meisten Leute diesen Teil halt nicht kennen.
349. [pure] Mathe-Leuten? Jedenfalls, ich bin wortwörtlich Kunstgeschichtsstudentin, die nur, äh, zufällig an, ich meine, faire Bezahlung für Servicekräfte glaubt, im Grunde.
350. [pure] Abgemacht, aber nächstes Mal nehmen wir die Taschenrechner-App wie normale Menschen, anstatt das Abendessen in eine philosophische Debatte über die Servicebranche zu verwandeln.
351. [en] Well, headaches can be, uh, tricky to diagnose, I mean, but let me [joking] assure you it's probably not a brain tumor like WebMD suggested. When did these headaches actually start, and are they concentrated in any particular area of your head?
352. [en] Hmm, behind the eyes often indicates, like, tension headaches or possibly, you know, sinus-related issues. Have you been experiencing any er, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light, or changes in your sleep patterns recently?
353. [en] That's definitely a contributing factor—sleep deprivation is one of the most common triggers for chronic headaches. Your brain needs consistent rest to regulate pain perception and clear metabolic waste products.
354. [en] Everyone's neurological system responds [jealous] differently to stress and sleep deprivation. What works for Sarah might not work for you, and comparing yourself to others isn't particularly helpful for your treatment plan.
355. [en] No no, you're not overreacting at all, actually, chronic headaches can, um, significantly impact quality of life, honestly. Let's do a proper neurological exam and possibly order an MRI if these symptoms persist beyond basic interventions.
356. [en] Look, I understand the, uh, financial concerns, but we need to [passionately] prioritize your health here, you know? There are payment plans available, and honestly, catching something early is always less expensive than treating it later when it's advanced.
357. [en] For now, let's start with, well, lifestyle modifications—regular sleep schedule, reducing screen time, staying hydrated, basically. I'm also prescribing a, hmm, mild preventative medication that should help reduce the frequency and intensity of these headaches.
358. [en] Most patients notice significant improvement within two to three weeks of consistent treatment. The key is adherence to the plan—taking medication regularly, maintaining sleep hygiene, and avoiding known triggers.
359. [en] Then we'll, uh, adjust the treatment plan, try different medications, or, you know, explore other diagnostic options. Medicine is often about finding what works specifically for you through careful observation and adjustment.
360. [en] Of course—that's my job, and your health concerns are always valid. Let's schedule a follow-up in two weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.
361. [pure] Danke für die Einladung, ähm, es ist schön hier zu sein und, na ja, über diese wirklich wichtigen Themen zu sprechen, die Millionen von Menschen weltweit betreffen, besonders die jüngeren Generationen, die komplett online aufgewachsen sind.
362. [pure] Das stimmt genau, und die Forschung, äh, zeigt dass die gleichen [confused] Dopaminbahnen aktiviert werden, ich meine, wenn wir Likes und Benachrichtigungen erhalten. Diese Plattformen beschäftigen Verhaltenspsychologen, um die Nutzungszeit zu maximieren, was sich direkt in Werbeeinnahmen für sie niederschlägt.
363. [pure] Da gibt es einen entscheidenden Unterschied, hmm, weil traditionelle Medien tatsächlich natürliche Endpunkte haben, die Sache ist die. Eine Fernsehsendung endet, ein Film ist zu Ende, aber Social-Media-Feeds sind endlose Scrolls, die darauf ausgelegt sind, jede natürliche Pause oder jeden Ausstiegspunkt zu eliminieren.
364. [pure] Das ist ein Vergleich, den viele Experten jedenfalls ziehen, und es ist ähh, nicht übertrieben, wenn man bedenkt, es ist halt so, dass beide Branchen von schädlichen Auswirkungen wussten, während sie diese öffentlich leugneten. Interne Dokumente von Meta und anderen Unternehmen zeigen, dass sie sich der Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit bewusst waren, insbesondere bei Mädchen im Teenageralter.
365. [pure] Die Daten sprechen für sich—die Depressionsraten bei Teenagern sind seit 2012 sprunghaft angestiegen, was direkt mit der Smartphone-Verbreitung korreliert. Wir sehen beispiellose Angstzustände, Selbstverletzungen und Selbstmordversuche bei jungen Menschen, die mehr als 3 Stunden täglich in sozialen Medien verbringen.
366. [pure] Erstens, ah, brauchen wir Altersverifizierung und wirklich, Zeitlimits, die in diese Plattformen eingebaut sind, hier ist die Sache—genau wie wir Alkohol und Tabak regulieren. Eltern sollten technikfreie Zonen zu Hause einrichten, besonders während der Mahlzeiten und vor dem Schlafengehen, um echte menschliche Verbindungen wieder aufzubauen.
367. [pure] Die Umsetzung ist eine Herausforderung, ehrlich gesagt, aber nicht unmöglich, also, mehrere europäische Länder haben bereits Gesetze verabschiedet, die diese Schutzmaßnahmen vorschreiben, ähm. Die eigentliche Frage ist, ob wir die psychische Gesundheit unserer Kinder höher bewerten als die Profite der Technologieunternehmen.
368. [pure] Natürlich bieten sie einen Wert, also also, ich schlage nicht vor, dass wir Social Media komplett abschaffen, denke ich, aber vielleicht brauchen wir Leitplanken. Wir lassen Zigarettenfirmen auch nicht mehr bei Kindern werben, und wir sollten Social-Media-Unternehmen auch nicht erlauben, sie psychologisch zu manipulieren.
369. [pure] Achten Sie darauf, wie diese Plattformen Sie fühlen lassen, nicht nur während der Nutzung, sondern auch danach. Wenn Sie sich ängstlich, unzulänglich oder unfähig zu konzentrieren fühlen, sind das keine persönlichen Versäumnisse—das sind konstruierte Ergebnisse, die darauf ausgelegt sind, Sie am Scrollen zu halten.
370. [pure] Es ist ernüchternd, aber auch ermächtigend—sobald wir diese Mechanismen verstehen, können wir bewusste Entscheidungen über unsere Technologienutzung treffen. Wissen ist der erste Schritt, um sich von der digitalen Sucht zu befreien und unsere Aufmerksamkeit und unser Wohlbefinden zurückzugewinnen.
371. [en] Oh absolutely, um, we actually run tests constantly now. The thing is, most people test the wrong elements first - they'll change button colors when, you know, the real issue is their value proposition isn't clear.
372. [en] Headlines, without question. I mean, your headline determines whether people even read further, so, we typically see 20-30% lifts just from, er, testing different headline angles and messaging.
373. [en] Well, statistical significance is crucial - you need, hmm, at least 95% confidence usually. Most tools calculate this automatically now, but honestly, you also need to consider practical significance, like whether a 2% lift is worth implementing.
374. [en] Exactly! Implementation costs matter, and, er, here's the thing - small wins can add up, but sometimes you're better off, basically, focusing on bigger swing tests rather than micro-optimizations.
375. [en] Complete value proposition changes, like, pricing model shifts, or, well, totally different user flows. We once increased conversions 47% by, actually, adding MORE steps to our signup process because it reduced anxiety.
376. [en] I know it sounds counterintuitive, but, um, we were asking for credit card info too early. Breaking it into smaller steps with, you know, progress indicators made people more comfortable, so, completion rates shot up.
377. [en] Social proof is incredibly powerful when done right - testimonials, um, case studies, real numbers all [cry loudly] work, but generic stuff like "trusted by thousands" is, honestly, pretty useless these days.
378. [en] You absolutely have to segment them separately, I mean, mobile users behave completely differently. We run, er, parallel tests with different hypotheses because what works on desktop often, you know, fails miserably on mobile.
379. [en] Testing without a hypothesis! People just randomly [high-pitched] change things hoping something sticks instead of having a clear theory about why a change should improve conversions.
380. [en] Unfortunately yeah, but, well, the good news is once you start thinking systematically about it, like, the improvements compound. Every test teaches you something about your users, so, even failures become valuable data points.
381. [pure] Ach komm, Sorgen? Genau sowas bringt mein Blut in Wallung! Alle haben gesagt, während einer Pandemie ein Restaurant zu eröffnen wäre beruflicher Selbstmord, aber hier sind wir 3 Jahre später mit zwei Filialen und einem Kochbuchvertrag.
382. [pure] Anders wie? Weil ich für 6 Monate nach Japan ziehen muss? Schau, ich lerne seit 2 Jahren Japanisch und warte auf so eine Gelegenheit, und wenn dir das Universum so einen perfekten Ball zuwirft, dann haust du halt voll drauf.
383. [pure] Hatte gestern tatsächlich das Gespräch, und ja, es gab Tränen, aber auch Begeisterung. Meine Tochter sagte, wenn ich das nicht mache, wird sie mir nie verzeihen, weil ich ihr anscheinend beigebracht hab, niemals vor beängstigenden Chancen zurückzuschrecken.
384. [pure] Stimmt's? Und hier ist die Sache, äh, das Timing könnte nicht besser sein, weil, tatsächlich, die Kinder sind alt genug zum Besuchen, und mein Partner kann die meiste Zeit remote arbeiten. Wir machen daraus dieses ganze Familienabenteuer, wo sie in den Schulferien zu Besuch kommen.
385. [pure] Ach, absolut nicht, ich meine, es gibt noch so eine Million Unbekannte, aber ehrlich, genau das macht es ja spannend! Ich hab Tabellen für meine Tabellen, Notfallpläne für meine Notfallpläne, aber irgendwann musst du einfach springen und drauf vertrauen, dass du's schon hinkriegst.
386. [pure] Ha! Okay, vielleicht hab ich's ein bisschen übertrieben, aber ähm, Vorbereitung ist halt, wie ich mit der Angst umgehe, weißt du? Je beängstigender die Herausforderung, desto detaillierter wird meine Planung, obwohl ich immer Raum für schönes Chaos lasse, weil da passiert die Magie.
387. [pure] Das ist meine Marke! Aber im Ernst, ähh, das Leben ist zu kurz, um auf Nummer sicher zu gehen, und sowieso, alles worauf ich stolz bin, kam davon, dass ich ja gesagt hab, als mein Hirn nein geschrien hat. Weißt du noch, als ich mich für den Marathon angemeldet hab ohne jegliches Training?
388. [pure] Und bin trotzdem ins Ziel gekommen! Dieser Moment, als ich [extremely happy] die Ziellinie überquert hab, hat mir alles über mich selbst beigebracht. Schmerz ist vorübergehend, aber zu wissen, dass du nicht aufgegeben hast, als alles wehgetan hat? Das bleibt für immer.
389. [pure] Verrückt ist nur ein anderes Wort für wachstumsorientiert! Apropos, wann machst du endlich diesen Fotokurs, von dem du seit 3 Jahren redest?
390. [pure] Zu spät! Ich stell dich zur Rede, weil, na ja, zuzusehen wie Leute sich klein machen, wenn sie groß rauskommen könnten, das tut mir halt körperlich weh, also, was hält dich wirklich zurück?
391. [en] Absolutely not. The blocking was finalized three weeks ago after extensive rehearsal, and changing it now would throw off the entire rhythm of the act.
392. [en] The actors need to, well, adapt to the direction as given, honestly, not the other way around. This production has a very specific vision that I've been crafting for months, and, actually, every movement has been choreographed with purpose.
393. [en] Safety is one thing, but what you're suggesting, err, isn't about safety, it's about comfort, you know, and great theater doesn't come from comfort. The tension in their movements, actually, translates to authentic tension on stage.
394. [en] The lighting cues are precisely timed to the second, and if the technical crew can't execute them properly, then we need a new technical crew, not new cues.
395. [en] Watch me. I've fired crews the morning of opening night before, and the show went on magnificently because the replacements understood the importance of precision.
396. [en] The corset is historically accurate to the eighteen-eighties period, and, hmm, if she can't breathe, actually, she needs to work on her breathing technique, you know, not blame the costume.
397. [en] The performers signed contracts agreeing to my directorial vision, and that vision doesn't bend to accommodate every little complaint or discomfort they might have.
398. [en] It's not inflexibility, it's artistic integrity, and without it, we'd have nothing but mediocre community theater instead of the groundbreaking production this is meant to be.
399. [en] The producer hired me specifically because I deliver exceptional results through uncompromising standards, and if they want a different approach, they should have hired a different director.
400. [en] Collaboration happened during the planning phase three months ago, but now we're in execution mode, and yes, it's my way because that's what creates theatrical excellence, not committee decisions.
401. [mix] [careful] Die Zeugin hat ausdrücklich darum gebeten, dass keine Familienmitglieder, [measured], über ihren Aufenthaltsort oder ihre neue Identität informiert werden, for security reasons.
402. [mix] [gentle] Ich verstehe.
403. [mix] [conflicted] Also, ähm, die Wahrheit ist, sie hat speziell nach dir gefragt, aber, [torn], sie ließ uns versprechen, ihre Identität nicht zu enthüllen, bis sie, [heavy], bereit war, dir selbst gegenüberzutreten. [sighs deeply]
404. [mix] [soft] Sie hat, naja, versucht die richtigen Worte zu finden, um zu erklären, warum sie verschwinden musste, ähm, [pained], warum sie niemanden kontaktieren konnte, especially you. [long pause]
405. [mix] Ich weiß, das ist, ähm, unmöglich gerade zu verarbeiten, aber sie hat, [protective], Beweise gegen Leute gesammelt, die eure ganze, [urgent], Familie getötet hätten, wenn sie nicht verschwunden wäre, when she did.
406. [mix] [proud] Sie war, naja, der wertvollste Informant, den wir je in dieser Organisation hatten, ähm, [reverent], hat alles riskiert, um einen Fall aufzubauen, der ihr gesamtes, [determined], Menschenhandelsnetzwerk ein für alle Mal zerschlagen wird. [voice strengthens]
407. [mix] [warm] Sie wartet tatsächlich gerade im Nebenzimmer, [emotional], hoping you'd want to see her.
408. [mix] [understanding] Nimm dir alle Zeit, die du brauchst, denn, ähm, sie bereitet sich seit Monaten auf diesen Moment vor, und ehrlich gesagt, [vulnerable], she's just as terrified of facing you as you are of, naja, [tender], sie wiederzusehen.
409. [mix] [supportive] Ich bin direkt hier, falls eine von euch etwas braucht, [caring], und wenn es etwas wert ist, sie hat nie aufgehört dich zu lieben, even when, [meaningful], wegzubleiben der einzige Weg war, dich zu, [emotional], beschützen. [voice wavers]
410. [mix] Geh zu ihr. [whispers]
411. [mix] Ich verstehe den historischen Wert, ähm, aber meine Verantwortung, [heavy], liegt bei den Rentnern, die, na ja, [thoughtful], ihre Leistungen gesichert brauchen, und eine Liquidierung, [resigned], würde sofortige Mittel bereitstellen.
412. [mix] [respectful] Schauen Sie, ich bin nicht, äh, unsensibel gegenüber dem, was diese Papiere repräsentieren, [struggling], aber wir sprechen hier über die Renten echter Menschen, [weary], Sie wissen, was ich meine?
413. [mix] [considering] Hmm, das ist ein interessanter Punkt, aber, ähm, wir müssten erhebliche Mittel im Voraus für die Konservierung investieren, [calculating], which means less liquidity for current obligations, und, na ja, [uncomfortable], der Vorstand wird diese Art von, äh, Verzögerung nicht schätzen.
414. [mix] [surprised] Frederick Douglass selbst hat in diese Ränder geschrieben, [impressed], und wir haben sie all diese Jahre in einem feuchten Keller aufbewahrt, [regretful], ohne ihre Bedeutung zu kennen? [sighs]
415. [mix] [torn] Meine Treuhandpflicht verlangt von mir, die Renditen für unsere Mitglieder zu maximieren, [conflicted], but there's also something to be said for, [thoughtful], Teile unserer gemeinsamen Geschichte zu bewahren.
416. [mix] [intrigued] Sie schlagen vor, dass wir, ähm, beides haben könnten, indem wir, [cautious], strategisch verkaufen und dabei, na ja, die Integrität der Sammlung bewahren?
417. [mix] Der Vorstand trifft sich nächsten Dienstag, und, äh, sie werden harte Zahlen wollen, [businesslike], nicht nur Versprechen über historische Bedeutung, wissen Sie?
418. [mix] [thoughtful] 23 Jahre lang habe ich die Zukunft anderer Menschen verwaltet, und, ähm, das könnte das erste Mal sein, [reflective], dass mich jemand bittet, auch ihre Vergangenheit zu verwalten. [exhales]
419. [mix] [decided] Schicken Sie mir den Bericht Montagmorgen, und ich werde sicherstellen, dass der Vorstand, [firm], versteht, was hier auf dem Spiel steht, beyond just the numbers. [resolved]
420. [mix] [mature] Vielleicht bedeutet Treuhänderschaft wirklich das, hmm, nicht nur das Geld zu schützen, sondern, [philosophical], was das Geld repräsentiert, und, na ja, [concluding], what we choose to leave behind for those who come after us. [sighs deeply]
421. [pure] Na ja, äh, so wollte ich eigentlich nicht, [measured], dass du es erfährst, aber ähm, die Ermittlungen begannen vor drei Monaten, als, [professional], Unregelmäßigkeiten in mehreren Finanzberichten auftauchten, die, [uncomfortable], über meinen Schreibtisch wanderten.
422. [pure] [firmly] Hör zu, ich meine, ich habe versucht, mich, [conflicted], sofort für befangen erklären zu lassen, aber, ähm, meine Vorgesetzte meinte, ich müsste, [frustrated], dranbleiben, bis wir wüssten, ob da wirklich, [resigned], was dran ist.
423. [pure] [quietly] Ich weiß. [long pause]
424. [pure] [defensive] Tja, ähm, genau deshalb ist das alles so, [pained], kompliziert, verstehst du? [sighs heavily]
425. [pure] [steadily] Die Geldtransfers auf die Auslandskonten sind nicht, [careful], das, was sie oberflächlich zu sein scheinen.
426. [pure] [exhausted] Meine Freundin sollte eigentlich kein Geld über, [disgusted], Briefkastenfirmen waschen, und du hast jede einzelne, [disappointed], Transaktion abgezeichnet. [heavy sigh]
427. [pure] [torn] Das bringt mich auch um, aber, [wavering], die Beweise zeigen, dass du eigenständige Transfers gemacht hast, nachdem, [clinical], ich dir ausdrücklich gesagt hatte, alle, [hardening], Geldbewegungen letzten Monat einzustellen. [pause]
428. [pure] [stunned] Die Behandlung meiner Mutter? Ähm, du hast mir nie gesagt, dass du dafür, [confused], bezahlst, ich meine—
429. [pure] [breaking] Oh Gott, ich habe einen Fall aufgebaut, der dich, [horrified], zerstören wird, weil du versucht hast, [anguished], meine Mutter zu retten, während ich in meinem Büro saß und überzeugt war, du wärst, [ashamed], schuldig.
430. [pure] [urgent] Hör mir zu—wir können das in Ordnung bringen, [determined], aber du musst mir alles erzählen, jetzt sofort, jedes, [desperate], einzelne Detail über diese Konten. [grabs hand]
431. [pure] [measured] Die Regisseurin weiß über unsere, [hesitant], Situation Bescheid und hat es von den Tagesdispos ferngehalten, weil sie wollte, dass wir beide uns, [gentle], auf die Arbeit konzentrieren.
432. [pure] [soft] Hör zu, ich weiß, mich hier zu sehen ist, [uncomfortable], wahrscheinlich das Letzte, womit du gerechnet hast, während du an deinem, [proud], Abschlussfilm arbeitest.
433. [pure] Ich verfolge deine, [emotional], Arbeit an der Filmschule durch die Professoren, die, ähm, über ihre besten Studentinnen posten und, also, du machst unglaubliche Sachen, die mich, ich meine, [choked up], stolz machen. [pause]
434. [pure] [quiet] So ungefähr.
435. [pure] [remorseful] Jeden einzelnen Tag wollte ich mich, [heavy], melden, aber ich wusste nicht, ob du von jemandem hören willst, die, [ashamed], weggegangen ist, als du sie am meisten gebraucht hast. [sighs]
436. [pure] Also, ähm, die Wahrheit ist, ich meine, [painful], ich bin gegangen, weil ich nicht wusste, wie ich die Mutter sein sollte, die du verdient hast.
437. [pure] [pleading] Ich war 22 und, ähm, hatte Angst und deine Mutter hatte ihre, [remembering], Familie, die ihr half, während ich, na ja, nichts hatte außer meiner eigenen kaputten Kindheit als, [vulnerable], Vorlage. [tears up]
438. [pure] Ich hab dein Babyfoto in jedem, [tender], Equipmentkoffer, den ich besitze. [pause]
439. [pure] [determined] Ich gehe, [firm], nirgendwohin, außer du sagst mir, ich soll gehen.
440. [pure] [grateful] Ich würde mir wirklich, [emotional], nichts mehr wünschen als diese Chance. [sniffles]
441. [en] [stunned] I, um, I don't know what you're, well, [shaking] I changed my name for a reason and, uh, [defensive] I never thought anyone from back then would find me here.
442. [en] They made their choice when they [bitter] said I was dead to them for loving who I loved, so I, um, [hollow] became someone else entirely and, well, [detached] built my life page by page like the books I bind. [long pause]
443. [en] [barely audible] You didn't stop them. [exhales]
444. [en] [defensive] The person you're looking for doesn't [coldly] exist anymore, can't you understand that?
445. [en] [wavering] Um, don't do this.
446. [en] [resigned] You have no idea what it cost me to [heavy] become someone dad couldn't destroy with his disappointment. [sighs deeply]
447. [en] [shocked] He never, um, I mean he never even acknowledged I was, well, [crumbling] his child after that night, so why would he, uh, [confused] call for someone he said was dead? [voice breaks]
448. [en] It doesn't change what happened or [angry] bring back the years I spent alone, wondering if I was [defeated] worth loving at all.
449. [en] [exhausted] I've been coming here for, um, six months for my back pain, and you're telling me you knew, well, [incredulous] who I was this whole time and just, uh, [hurt] kept working on me like nothing had happened? [silence]
450. [en] [sinking] Maybe there was never going to be a [defeated] right moment for something this broken.
451. [mix] [defensive] Dieser Vorfall wurde gründlich untersucht und wir wurden, [uncomfortable], von 3 separaten Aufsichtsbehörden von jeder kriminellen Fahrlässigkeit freigesprochen und, [quieter], haben alle Vergleiche bezahlt. [exhales sharply]
452. [mix] Die Rechtsabteilung hat das alles geregelt und ehrlich gesagt überwache ich nicht persönlich, [dismissive], jede operative Entscheidung in jeder Firma in die wir investieren.
453. [mix] [alarmed] Soll das irgendeine Art von, [nervous], Drohung sein, because I can have security here immediately.
454. [mix] [shocked] Warte mal, ähm, du bist diejenige die diesen Vorschlag geschickt hat über, äh, [confused], Hilfe für Familien die von Unternehmensfahrlässigkeit betroffen sind, ich meine, das warst du?
455. [mix] [conflicted] Ich, ähm, ich erinnere mich tatsächlich an diesen Tag weil meine Tochter eigentlich, also, [voice dropping], genau an diesem Ort für einen Schulausflug sein sollte aber an diesem Morgen krank wurde.
456. [mix] [guilty] Schau, äh, die Versicherungen und Anwälte haben sofort übernommen und ich meine, [struggling], we weren't allowed to admit anything that could increase liability.
457. [mix] [broken] Jesus Christus, ich hatte keine Ahnung dass es so, [horrified], schlimm war, because they kept all those details out of the reports we saw, und ehrlich gesagt wollte ich, [crumbling], nie die wahren menschlichen Kosten wissen. [voice cracking]
458. [mix] Die Finanzierung die du verlangst ist, [calculating], erheblich aber ich könnte es als Social Impact Investment strukturieren.
459. [mix] [resolved] Du hast recht und ich werde es voll finanzieren, [sincere], nicht als Investment sondern als das was es wirklich ist. [pauses heavily]
460. [mix] [melancholic] Dann lass mich alles direkt auf dich überschreiben ohne jegliche Bedingungen, because maybe funding your mission is the only way I can live with what we allowed to happen. [sighs deeply]
461. [pure] [concerned] Du kommst nie so spät zur Gießerei, außer es ist was, [wary], schief gelaufen, also sag mir einfach, was los ist, weil dein Gesichtsausdruck, [anxious], mir den Magen umdreht.
462. [pure] [stunned] Stockholm ist, ähm, 6000 Kilometer von dieser Gießerei entfernt, ich meine, [hollow], von allem, was wir hier in dieser Stadt aufgebaut haben, wo meine Familie schon seit, na ja, [trailing off], drei Generationen Metall verarbeitet.
463. [pure] Die Hitze dieser Öfen war meine, [bitter], ständige Begleiterin seit 15 Jahren und jetzt verlangst du von mir, sie gegen, [defeated], skandinavische Winter und eine Sprache einzutauschen, die ich nicht spreche.
464. [pure] [angry] Unsere Zukunft sollte hier sein, wo ich, [gesturing wildly], zu Fuß zur Arbeit gehen und rußbedeckt heimkommen kann, um dich in diesem Sessel am Fenster lesen zu sehen, [voice breaking], nicht am anderen Ende der Welt, während du, [quieter], Träumen nachjagst.
465. [pure] [exhausted] Deine Ambitionen rosten nicht, sie, ähm, [resigned], führen dich nur weg von jemandem, der ihr ganzes Leben darauf ausgerichtet hat, na ja, [broken], dich zu lieben.
466. [pure] [gentle] Jedes Stück, das ich schmiede, erinnert mich daran, wie wir sein sollten, [tender], formbar genug, um uns zu biegen, ohne zu brechen.
467. [pure] [contemplating] Mein Großvater sagte immer, dass die besten Legierungen, ähm, [thoughtful], aus der Verbindung verschiedener Metalle unter extremem Druck und Hitze entstehen, also vielleicht, na ja, [softening], ist das einfach unser Schmelztiegel-Moment. [sighs]
468. [pure] [reluctant] Zwei Jahre Videoanrufe, wo ich nicht, [pained], dein Shampoo riechen oder deine kalten Füße an meinen im Bett spüren kann, [struggling], zusehen, wie du dir ein Leben aufbaust an einem Ort, wo ich nur eine, [whispered], Besucherin bin. [pause]
469. [pure] [surprised] Wenn du es so sagst, klingt es fast, [considering], machbar, obwohl meine Hände buchstäblich durch Generationen von, [wistful], Tradition und Muskelgedächtnis an diesen Ort geschweißt sind.
470. [pure] [resolute] Wenn wir das wirklich durchziehen, dann muss ich es, ähm, [determined], morgen meinem Vater sagen, bevor er es von jemand anderem in der Gießerei hört, weil, ich meine, [nervous], Neuigkeiten verbreiten sich hier schneller als flüssiges Metall und, na ja, [breathing deeply], er hat es verdient, es von mir zu hören.
471. [mix] [quiet] Ja, ich, ähm, erinnere mich daran, diese Berichte gelesen zu haben, nachdem, nun ja, [hollow], nachdem meine Produzentin hier unten gestorben ist, als sie versuchte, ähm, the story nobody wanted to hear zu bekommen. [exhales]
472. [mix] Schau, ich meine, ich bin heute nicht als Journalistin hier, [trembling], ich bin hier, weil ich, ähm, jede Woche durch diesen Tunnel gehe, nur um, nun ja, mich an sie zu erinnern.
473. [mix] [struggling] Jeden Donnerstag um, ähm, 15:47 Uhr, genau zu der Zeit, als, [voice cracking], die Decke herunterkam und ich, nun ja, everything that mattered to me verloren habe.
474. [mix] [barely audible] Ich auch.
475. [mix] [firm] Hör auf damit.
476. [mix] Sarah hätte es, ähm, gehasst, dich so zu sehen, ich meine, [gentle], sie sagte immer, du wärst die einzige Inspektorin, die wirklich, nun ja, einen Dreck darauf gab, Menschen zu schützen. [sighs]
477. [mix] [trembling] Sie war, ähm, 6 Jahre lang meine Partnerin und wir wollten, [choking up], in jenem Sommer heiraten, aber ich habe es nie, nun ja, [broken], jemandem beim Sender erzählt, because we wanted to keep it private. [crying softly]
478. [mix] [resolved] Sie starb, [steady], beim Versuch Menschen zu evakuieren, weil sie deinen Berichten glaubte, when nobody else would listen.
479. [mix] [desperate] Bitte, ähm, sag es mir einfach.
480. [mix] [determined] Dann kämpfen wir.
481. [mix] I didn't know you worked here, [uncomfortable], ich brauchte nur etwas, [swallowing], Obst für das Kirchenkonzert morgen, also, [trailing off], das ist unerwartet.
482. [mix] [measured] The cathedral commissioned a new organ, [careful], und sie haben mich vor 6 Monaten zurück in die Stadt versetzt, aber ich war mir nicht sicher, ob, [hesitant], Kontakt aufzunehmen willkommen wäre.
483. [mix] [quietly] Every single day. [long pause]
484. [mix] [gentle] I know this isn't ideal, [emotional], aber dich hier zu sehen, gesund und arbeitend, es ist, na ja, es ist mehr als ich, [grateful], nach allem was passiert ist erhofft hatte. [sighs heavily]
485. [mix] [remorseful] Building organs became my escape, [ashamed], meine Art mit der Trauer umzugehen, und als ich realisierte was ich, [pained], verloren hatte, fühlte es sich zu spät an zurückzukommen.
486. [mix] [hopeful] Well, the cathedral organ needs constant maintenance, [careful], und ich könnte eine Assistentin gebrauchen, wenn du jemals lernen möchtest.
487. [mix] I understand completely. [pause]
488. [mix] [grateful] That's very kind of you to suggest, [touched], und vielleicht könnten wir, [hopeful], mehr reden während du mir hilfst sie auszuwählen?
489. [mix] [tearful] He was right about so many things, [regretful], und ich hätte mehr auf ihn hören sollen, besonders darüber, [voice breaking], was wirklich im Leben zählt. [choked up]
490. [mix] [relieved] I'd like that more than you know, [genuine], meine Tochter.
491. [pure] [gasp] Drei? Hast du gerade gesagt—ich meine, das kann doch nicht... [shaky voice] Moment, willst du mir wirklich sagen, dass drei unserer Leute... wegen Entscheidungen, die ich getroffen habe? [pause] Oh Gott. Ähm, ich muss—ich muss mich kurz hinsetzen. [very quietly] Ihre Namen, wie hießen sie... ach nein, ich kenne ihre Namen ja. Sarah aus der Buchhaltung, sie war gerade mal 26. Und Marcus, der hatte doch diese Zwillinge, oder? [crying while speaking] Die Umstrukturierung, das war meine Idee. Die Überstunden-Pflicht, dafür hab ich mich stark gemacht. Ich dachte halt, wir wären effizient, verstehst du? [long pause]

[whispering] Wie konnte ich das nicht sehen? Ich meine, die Anzeichen müssen doch—Gott, die Sache ist, ich saß wortwörtlich in Meetings und hab über Produktivitätskennzahlen geredet, während diese Menschen... [sniffle] Sie sind untergegangen und ich hab, was, auf Tabellen gestarrt? [very sad] Jede einzelne Entscheidung, ich schwöre, ich dachte, ich würde—aber das ist jetzt auch egal, oder? Drei Familien zerstört, weil ich die Quartalsziele erreichen wollte. [regretful] Ehrlich, wie soll man damit... wie soll ich damit leben? Mit dem Wissen, dass sie noch da wären, wenn ich einfach, keine Ahnung, auf echte Menschen geachtet hätte statt auf Zahlen? [upset] Sie wären noch da.
492. [pure] [gasp loudly] Oh mein Gott, das war—das Kind wäre beinah von den Einkaufswagen zerquetscht worden! [shaky voice] Ich hab das wie in Zeitlupe ablaufen sehen, weißt du? Die ganze Reihe rollte direkt auf ihn zu und ich war wie gelähmt, ich konnte nicht mal—meine Stimme hat versagt. [relieved] Aber der Mitarbeiter, der ist einfach hingesprungen, regelrecht hingehechtet und hat das Kind gepackt, es weggerissen, so... ähm... eine halbe Sekunde vor dem Aufprall.

[pause]

Die Mutter hat überhaupt nichts mitbekommen, sie hat auf ihr Handy gestarrt und plötzlich war ihr Kind in den Armen von diesem Typen und 20 Metallwagen sind da in die Wand gekracht, wo er gerade noch gestanden hatte. [very sincerely] Ich meine, das wäre... Gott, ich will gar nicht dran denken. [grateful] Der Mitarbeiter hat dem kleinen Jungen das Leben gerettet, keine Frage. Also, er hat nicht mal eine Sekunde gezögert, reiner Instinkt.

[emotional] Und wie er dann das Kind einfach so der Mutter zurückgegeben hat, ganz lässig, als wär's nichts gewesen? [laugh] Der verdient wahrscheinlich Mindestlohn und hat einfach... [trailing off] Ich hätte nach seinem Namen fragen sollen. Weißt du was, ich geh jetzt einen Manager suchen und sorg dafür, dass die erfahren, was er getan hat. [determined] Da arbeitet ein echter Held auf ihrem Parkplatz.
493. [pure] [confused] Warte, dieser Name auf dem—nein, das kann doch nicht... [gasp] Oh mein Gott. [pause] Tommy? Tommy Chen aus, aus der dritten Klasse? [anxious] Ich schaue gerade auf seine Unterschrift hier auf den Gründungsdokumenten und ich—Scheiße, das ist seine Firma. [laugh] Der mit dem, ähm, dem kleinen Tech-Startup, das diese—[trailing off] [long pause] Wir haben früher diese verrückten Roboter-Dinger in seiner Garage gebaut, weißt du noch? Seine Mutter hat uns immer diese... [warm] diese unglaublichen Teigtaschen gemacht. [bitter] Und jetzt sitze ich hier mit einer scheiß Tabelle und rechne aus, wie viel wir verdienen, wenn wir sein Lebenswerk zerstören. [frustrated] Ich mein, ist doch nur Geschäft, oder? [hesitantly] Das ist, was wir machen. Wir finden die Ineffizienzen, wir verschlanken, wir— [very quietly] wir machen Sachen kaputt. [regretful] Gott, er weiß es wahrscheinlich noch nicht mal. Morgen früh kriegt er den Anruf und... [shaky voice] Hör mal, ich wusste—ich wusste nicht, dass es seine ist, okay? Der Name war anders, es war nur eine weitere Akte auf meinem Schreibtisch. [angry] Aber das spielt keine Rolle, oder? Weil ich es trotzdem machen werde. [whispering] Ich muss. [very sad] Zwanzig Jahre, seit wir das letzte Mal gesprochen haben und so—[sniffle] so sage ich wieder Hallo.
494. [mix] [relieved] Weißt du, als ich die Zahlen zum ersten Mal durchgerechnet habe—ehrlich, ich konnte es nicht glauben. 40 Prozent Reduzierung der Umweltbelastung. Also, [pause] ich hab die Berechnungen immer wieder überprüft, weil, ähm, das schien unmöglich für eine Kunststofffabrik.

[excited] Ich meine, wir reden hier von echter Veränderung! Die Sache ist, [slowly] alle gehen immer davon aus, dass Kunststoffproduktion dieser, na ja, Umwelt-Albtraum sein muss. Aber ich habe bewiesen—na ja, [proud] wir haben das Gegenteil bewiesen.

[hesitantly] Obwohl ehrlich gesagt, manchmal frage ich mich immer noch, ob es genug ist. Also klar, 40 Prozent ist riesig, [sigh] aber wir stellen immer noch Plastik her, oder? Meine Schwester, die macht mir immer—[frustrated] Gott, sie macht mir so einen Stress deswegen. "Du machst das Problem nur weniger schlimm," sagt sie. [bitter] Danke, wirklich hilfreich.

[warming up] Aber dann denke ich an, ähm, die Tonnen von Emissionen, die wir jetzt nicht mehr freisetzen. Das Wasser, das wir nicht verschmutzen. Und also, [passionately] irgendjemand muss diese Arbeit machen! We can't just pretend plastics don't exist while we're still using them for literally everything.

[very quietly] Vielleicht versuche ich es nur mir selbst zu rechtfertigen. [pause] Oder vielleicht, [confidently] vielleicht passiert Veränderung genau so—eine Effizienzverbesserung nach der anderen.
495. [pure] [gasp softly] Ich mache es. Ich mache es wirklich—oh mein Gott, [extremely happy] schau dir meine Füße an! Sie bewegen sich, sie bewegen sich echt! [crying while speaking] Die Ärzte haben gesagt—sie haben mir direkt ins Gesicht gesagt, ich würde nie wieder... [pause] Und hier bin ich, verstehst du?

[laugh] 3 Schritte. Das sind 3 ganze Schritte! Also, meine Beine fühlen sich an wie Wackelpudding, aber wen kümmert's? [shaky voice] Weißt du noch, als Dr. Morrison sagte, die Nervenschäden wären permanent? Dass ich meine, ähm, "Erwartungen anpassen" sollte? Na ja, [bitter] wo ist er jetzt, hm?

[very excited] Siehst du das? Schaust du zu? Weil ich brauche—ich brauche jemanden, der das bezeugt! [gasp loudly] Warte, ich versuch's nochmal. Hier, nur... [hesitantly] okay, mein linkes Bein ist ziemlich wackelig, aber es—[relieved] es hält mich aufrecht!

[cry] Ich dachte, ich hätte es akzeptiert, weißt du? Den Rollstuhl, das alles. Aber irgendwie hab ich halt... ich weiß nicht, ich hab einfach diese Übungen weitergemacht, die du mir gezeigt hast. [warm] Jeden einzelnen Tag, auch wenn es sinnlos schien. Und jetzt—[laugh loudly] jetzt laufe ich! Ich laufe wirklich! [whispering] Danke. Dass du mich nicht aufgegeben hast, als buchstäblich alle anderen es taten.
496. [pure] [gasp] Warte, bist du—meinst du das gerade ernst? Du willst, dass ich die Patentante werde? [very excited] Oh mein Gott, Sarah, ich kann gar nicht—das ist so krass! Ich meine, wir reden hier von deinem Baby. [pause] Deinem echten winzigen Menschen, den du großziehen wirst und... [emotional] Sorry, ich werde gerade total komisch, aber ehrlich, ich hätte nicht erwartet—ich dachte, du fragst vielleicht deine Schwester oder, ähm, keine Ahnung, jemand Vernünftigeres? [laugh] Weißt du noch, als ich die Sukkulente umgebracht habe, die du mir geschenkt hast? Zweimal! [warm] Aber du fragst mich wirklich, so ein Teil ihres Lebens zu sein, bei all den großen Momenten und den kleinen dabei zu sein und... [sniffle] Gott, warum heule ich jetzt? Das ist so peinlich. [happy] Ja! Natürlich ja, ich sage ja! Ich bin nur—wow, ich darf die coole Patentante sein, die das Kind total verwöhnt, oder? Das ist doch praktisch die Jobbeschreibung? [sincerely] Sarah, ich verspreche dir, ich werde dieses Kind so unfassbar lieben. Also, es wird wissen, dass es jemanden hat, der immer, immer für es da sein wird. [cry] Okay, jetzt heulst du auch und wir sind beide ein Wrack! Komm her, komm in meine Arme. Das ist das Schönste, worum mich je jemand gebeten hat.
497. [en] Three point seven million dollars. That's what Uncle Richard left me. [confused] The same Uncle Richard who forgot my birthdays, who told me I'd never amount to anything, who—[bitter] who couldn't even look me in the eye at family dinners. [short pause] I keep reading the will, like maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

[angry] Twenty-three years of nothing, and now this? I mean, what am I supposed to feel here? [sarcastic] Grateful? To a man who made me feel invisible my entire childhood? [laughing] God, this is so messed up. 

[quietly] Mom says he was proud of me. [frustrated] Well, where was that pride when I graduated? Where was it when I needed—[trailing off] whatever. [sigh] 

The lawyer keeps calling it a "generous bequest." [mocking] Generous. Right. Like money fixes everything. [pause] Though honestly, it does fix the student loans. And the medical bills. And—[hesitantly] shit, am I actually considering this?

[very sad] You know what the worst part is? Um, I would've traded every penny just to hear him say he cared. Once. [sniffle] Just once would've been enough. [bitterly] But no, he had to wait until he was dead to acknowledge I existed. 

[exhausted] Classic Uncle Richard. Still controlling everything from the grave.
498. [pure] [nervous] Also, ähm, ich hab die Beförderung bekommen. Anlagenführerin. Ja. [pause] Das Gehalt ist, also, es ist wirklich gut—so vierzig Prozent mehr als jetzt. [bitter] Und weißt du, was das Ding ist? Ich weiß genau, was wir herstellen. Ich weiß genau, was aus diesen Pellets wird. Flaschen, die dann, na ja, [regretful] im Meer landen oder so. Mikroplastik im—egal. [frustrated] Aber meine Kinder brauchen, äh, sie brauchen halt Sachen, okay? Das Studium wird nicht billiger. [defensive] Und ist ja nicht so, dass die Anlage plötzlich stillsteht, wenn ich's nicht mache, oder? [laugh] Dann macht's halt eine andere—das sag ich mir jedenfalls immer wieder. [sad] Meine Tochter, sie, äh, sie studiert Umweltwissenschaften. [pause] Ist das nicht einfach... [trailing off] Gott. [quietly] Ich hab's ihr noch nicht gesagt. Von der Beförderung. [anxious] Sie schickt mir ständig diese Artikel über, na ja, den Plastikstrudel im Pazifik und ehrlich gesagt, ich kann einfach nicht—[groan] Ich lese sie. Jeden einzelnen. [shaky voice] Und dann geh ich zur Arbeit und produziere noch mehr davon. [bitter] Aber die Krankenversicherung übernimmt jetzt Therapie, also das ist... [laugh] das ist ja schon mal was. [very quietly] Noch zwanzig Jahre bis zur Rente. [sigh] Noch zwanzig Jahre.
499. [en] [anxious] God, okay so, when I heard that engine sputter through the radio—I mean, that's a frozen fuel line if I've ever heard one. And honestly, with kids out there? In this weather? [quickly] I grabbed every tool I had, like, literally threw them in the sled because the thing is, you know, hypothermia sets in fast. Really fast.

[focused] Their Arctic Cat was just... dead. Completely seized. And the dad, he's looking at me like—well, anyway, I could see the panic. [reassuring] "Hey, it's okay," I told him, "I've basically rebuilt a hundred of these." Which, um, wasn't exactly a lie. Sort of.

[determined] So I'm lying in the snow, right? My hands are, er, completely numb, but I managed to bypass the—actually, you know what? [excited] The fuel pump relay, that's what saved them! I jerry-rigged it with, I guess, some wire from my emergency kit. 

[relieved] And then—oh God—when that engine finally turned over? [emotional] The little girl, she just... she started crying. Happy tears though. Her lips were literally blue before we got them moving. [pause] I mean, thirty more minutes out there and... [trailing off]

[warm] Anyway, they're safe. That's what matters. [chuckle] The dad tried to pay me, but honestly? Seeing them drive away alive was, you know... that was enough.
500. [pure] [gasp loudly] Sie will, dass ich ihre Trauzeugin werde? Nach—nach drei Jahren Funkstille? [confused] Ich meine, wir haben seit Mamas Beerdigung kein richtiges Gespräch mehr geführt, und jetzt ruft sie plötzlich an, so nach dem Motto, [mocking] "Hey, erinnerst du dich noch an mich? Deine Schwester?" [bitter] Und ich soll jetzt einfach... was, so tun als wäre alles in Ordnung?

[pause]

[shaky voice] Die Sache ist die, ähm, ich hab tatsächlich angefangen zu weinen, als sie gefragt hat. [sniffle] Nicht weil ich glücklich war—na ja, vielleicht ein bisschen—aber weil es sich so... [trailing off] keine Ahnung. [frustrated] Es ist halt so, als ob sie denkt, 'ne Hochzeitseinladung löscht alles aus, weißte? Die vergessenen Geburtstage, die—die komplette Funkstille, als Papa krank wurde. [angry] Sie hat nicht mal auf meine Nachrichten geantwortet!

[long pause]

[sadly] Aber dann hat sie gesagt, dass es ihr leidtut. [whispering] Wirklich leidtut. Und dass sie sich zu sehr geschämt hat, sich zu melden, aber beim Planen der Hochzeit ist ihr klar geworden... [speeding up] sie meinte, sie könnte sich nicht vorstellen, das ohne mich zu machen, dass es sich nicht richtig anfühlen würde, und ehrlich gesagt hab ich einfach— [cry] Mir fehlt es, eine Schwester zu haben. [very quietly] Sie fehlt mir wirklich, wirklich sehr.

[sigh]

[hesitantly] Also hab ich ja gesagt. [nervous laugh] Gott steh mir bei, ich hab ja gesagt. Vielleicht bin ich ja bescheuert, aber... [warm] vielleicht ist das unsere Chance, oder? [hopeful] Vielleicht können Hochzeiten wirklich was kitten.
501. [pure] Die Ergebnisse sind da. Endlich die DNA aus dem Labor zurück und, ähm, [relieved] es ist genau das, was wir brauchten—perfekte Übereinstimmung, um zu beweisen, dass Marcus nicht beim Überfall war. [pause] Ich meine, seine DNA ist nirgends am Tatort, also das ist—das sind doch gute Nachrichten, oder? [nervous] Aber hier ist die Sache, äh, als ich die Probe durch die Datenbank hab laufen lassen, halt, weißt du, Sorgfaltspflicht... [long pause]

[whispering] Oh Gott. Da gibt's eine Übereinstimmung mit einem ungelösten Fall von 2019. [anxious] Ich schau mir das an und denk mir—wie ist das überhaupt möglich? Das Blut an dem zerbrochenen Fenster vom Harrison-Überfall, es ist, äh, [shaky voice] es ist hundertprozentig Marcus. [frustrated] Ich meine, was soll ich denn damit machen? Ehrlich, ich starre seit 20 Minuten auf diese Ergebnisse und ich—[trailing off]

[angry] Er hat dagesessen, okay, er hat dagesessen und mir geschworen, dass er niemals jemanden verletzt hätte. [bitter] "Ich bin unschuldig," hat er gesagt. Na ja, technisch gesehen, ja, unschuldig bei DIESEM Verbrechen, aber... [sigh] Die Sache ist, ich muss das melden, oder? [confused] Oder nicht? Nein, nein, natürlich muss ich, es ist nur—[upset] dafür hab ich mich nicht gemeldet. [very quietly] Ich dachte, ich rette einen unschuldigen Mann, und stattdessen bin ich dabei, ähm, [hesitantly] ich zerstöre trotzdem sein Leben. [long pause] Anderes Verbrechen, gleiches Ende.
502. [en] [clearing throat] So this is the vendor portal, um, where you'll be managing all the clinical site contracts. [formal] I've been doing this for eight years, so there's quite a bit to—anyway. [pause] You'll want to check this first thing every morning because the sites in Europe submit their queries overnight. Well, overnight for us. [bitter] Not for you, I guess, since you'll be in... where was it again? Mumbai? 

[sigh] Look, I'm trying to be professional here, but honestly, this is harder than I thought it would be. [shaky voice] Training someone to do the job that I—that was mine. [frustrated] They said it was nothing personal, just "strategic restructuring" or whatever corporate buzzword they're using. 

[slowly] The irony is, like, I built most of these systems myself. [sad] Every spreadsheet, every process flow, every relationship with these clinical sites. And now I have six weeks to basically download my entire brain to you. [laugh] No pressure, right? 

[apologetic] Sorry, I don't mean to make this weird for you. It's not your fault. [exhausted] You seem nice enough, and honestly, you'll probably do fine. [trailing off] The password for the database is... actually, let me just write all of this down.
503. [mix] [exhausted] God, I just... I literally just sat there teaching Lily about telling the truth, you know? [bitter] "Always be honest, sweetie. Die Ehrlichkeit ist das Wichtigste." Und die ganze Zeit denke ich an die Lieferung, die ich morgen verschiebe. [short pause] I mean, what else can I do? Ihre Behandlungen sind—Jesus, die kosten 40.000 im Monat. [anxious] Insurance won't cover experimental stuff, also ist es im Grunde... [trailing off]

[sigh] The thing is, um, sie schaut mich mit diesen Augen an, und ich versuche ehrlich nur, sie am Leben zu halten. [crying while speaking] But how do I explain that daddy breaks the law to buy her medicine? [frustrated] Like, "Hey honey, er, manchmal müssen Erwachsene unmögliche Entscheidungen treffen"?

She asked me today—[shaky voice] sie hat mich tatsächlich gefragt, ob ich jemals lüge. And I just... [long pause] I said no. [regretful] Direkt ins Gesicht, ich habe nein gesagt. Because, well, what am I supposed to say? "Ja Schätzchen, Papa schmuggelt Sachen über Grenzen, aber du solltest definitiv immer die Wahrheit sagen"? [very sad]

Maybe when she's older, she'll understand. [whispering] Oder vielleicht wird sie mich dafür hassen, dass ich so eine Heuchlerin bin. [pause] Either way, at least she'll be alive to make that choice.
504. [pure] [very excited] Ich hab's geschafft! Ich hab sie tatsächlich—Gott, ich kann's nicht fassen, dass ich sie endlich besiegt hab. All die Jahre, weißt du, all die Jahre, wo sie immer... [bitter] sie hatte immer dieses Grinsen drauf, so, jedes Mal wenn sie gewonnen hat. Und ich stand nur da und dachte mir, ähm, eines Tages. Eines Tages werde ich—na ja, jedenfalls, hier sind wir. [pause]

Aber dann, äh, ist was passiert, womit ich nicht... [confused] sie weint? Also, sie weint wirklich. Nicht diese, äh, falschen Tränen, die sie bei den Trainern abgezogen hat. Echte Tränen. [quietly] Und ehrlich gesagt weiß ich halt nicht, was ich damit anfangen soll.

Ich meine, sollte sich das nicht, [hesitantly], keine Ahnung, besser anfühlen? Ich hab so hart für diesen Moment trainiert—praktisch dafür gelebt. Jeden Morgen, wenn ich an ihre beschissene perfekte Technik gedacht hab, und jetzt... [long pause]

Sie sitzt da einfach, hm, völlig am Boden zerstört. [empathetically] Die Sache ist, ich glaub ich hab nie wirklich drüber nachgedacht, was verlieren für sie bedeutet. Vielleicht hat sie das ja genauso gebraucht wie—nein, eigentlich sogar mehr als ich?

[regretful] Scheiße. Ich wollte sie schlagen, aber nicht... nicht kaputtmachen. Verstehst du? Es ist komisch, ähm, jemanden, den man so lange gehasst hat, einfach... zusammenbrechen zu sehen. [sigh] Da fragt man sich schon, ob, tja, ob das alles überhaupt die Sache wert war.
505. [pure] [bitter] Drei Jahre. Drei verdammte Jahre hab ich mich auf diese Stelle vorbereitet. [frustrated] Ich meine, ich hab wortwörtlich das Handbuch geschrieben, das sie jetzt benutzen—der ganze Prozess für die Sozialleistungsanmeldung, das war alles ich. [pause] Und sie geben's dem Derek? [angry] Dem Jungen, der mich letzte Woche gefragt hat, wofür COBRA steht? [laugh] Oh mein Gott, ich kann nicht—[trailing off]

[very loudly] Der kann nicht mal Excel bedienen! [quietly] Ich decke ihn schon seit Monaten, ehrlich gesagt, korrigiere seine Fehler, bevor's jemand merkt. [sarcastic] Aber klar, ja, macht ihn zum Sachbearbeiter für Sozialleistungen. [groan] Weil mit dem Chef verwandt zu sein ist, ähm, offenbar die einzige Qualifikation, die heute noch zählt.

[sad] Weißt du, was das Schlimmste ist? [slowly] Ich dachte echt, meine Arbeit würde für sich sprechen. Also, all die Wochenenden, an denen ich während der Anmeldefristen reingekommen bin, [voice shaking] bis spät geblieben bin, um den Mitarbeitern ihre Optionen zu erklären... [sniffle] Schätze, das zählt alles nichts, wenn du nicht irgendwessen Neffe bist.

[furious] Und Sandra hatte die Frechheit—die absolute Frechheit—mir zu sagen, ich bräuchte mehr "Führungserfahrung." [mocking] Führungserfahrung? [loudly] Ich hab jeden neuen Mitarbeiter in der Abteilung eingearbeitet! [exhausted] Einschließlich dem lieben Derek, der immer noch, [emphatic] immer noch nicht den Unterschied zwischen gesetzlicher und privater Krankenversicherung versteht.

[resigned] Ist auch egal. [pause] Ich aktualisiere heute Abend mein LinkedIn-Profil.
506. [mix] Gott, ich kann immer noch nicht glauben, was wir heute gefunden haben. Nur ein ganz normaler Dienstag, weißt du? [casually] Wir gehen die Checkliste durch wie immer—Heizungsraum, Schalttafeln, das Übliche. Dann bleibt Marcus plötzlich stehen und [anxious] er hat diesen Blick im Gesicht. Das Messgerät fängt an verrückt zu spielen, piept ununterbrochen. [gasp] Erdgas. Hohe Konzentration. Right by the main line where it feeds into the building.

Ich meine, wir reden hier von... [shaky voice] 300 Menschen arbeiten in diesem Gebäude. 300. Wenn jemand eine Zigarette angezündet hätte, oder wenn die Heizung falsch angesprungen wäre, oder—actually, I can't even think about it. [pause] Die ganze Nordostecke hätte hochgehen können.

[relieved] Aber wir haben es rechtzeitig entdeckt. That's what matters, right? 20 Minuten früher und wir hätten es komplett verpasst. 20 Minuten später und, naja... [trailing off]

Die Sache ist, ähm, die Leute beschweren sich immer über diese Inspektionen. [frustrated] "Warum braucht ihr schon wieder Zugang? We just did this last month." Aber genau deshalb. [passionately] This is literally why we do what we do! Ein winziger Riss in einer Verschraubung, die wahrscheinlich schon seit Wochen langsam leckt.

[warm] Marcus bekommt eine Auszeichnung, natürlich. Hell, we all should. [chuckle] Wir haben heute tatsächlich Leben gerettet.
507. [pure] [bitter] Drei Millionen Series-A-Finanzierung. Drei Millionen Dollar, und ähm, alles woran ich denken kann ist, wie Sarah ihre Sachen gepackt hat, während ich beim Investorenmeeting war. [laugh] Ist das nicht perfekt? [pause] Fünf Jahre auf Bürosofas geschlafen, fünf Jahre lang „nur noch dieser eine Sprint, Schatz" und— [voice breaking] und jetzt will TechCrunch ein Feature machen. [sarcastic] Super Timing, oder? Die Wohnung fühlt sich so... [very quietly] ich erkenn sie ohne ihre Sachen gar nicht wieder. [long pause] Weißt du, was sie gesagt hat? Sie meinte, [mocking] „Glückwunsch, du hast endlich bekommen, was du wolltest." Als ob ich—als ob das von Anfang an mein Plan war. [frustrated] Ich wollte doch beides! Ich dachte, wir bauen gemeinsam etwas auf, aber anscheinend, [sad] hab ich halt alleine gebaut. [sigh] Das Team lässt gerade den Champagner knallen. Derek schickt mir ständig Fotos. [anxious] Ich sollte da sein, ich sollte mitfeiern, aber stattdessen sitze ich hier mit den Scheidungspapieren und dem Term Sheet, und ehrlich? [crying while speaking] Für mich sehen sie gerade genau gleich aus. Einfach nur... Verträge. [exhausted] Der eine ein Anfang, der andere ein Ende. [very melancholic] Vielleicht hatte sie recht. Vielleicht hab ich wirklich genau das bekommen, was ich wollte. [pause] Ich wusste nur nicht, dass es mich alles andere kosten würde.
508. [en] [gasp loudly] Six months? Six fucking months Sarah's been— I mean, I literally just found the receipts in her room. [confused] Wait, so all those times she was like "oh, I don't know what happened to your leftovers," she was just, um, straight up lying to my face? [angry] The hummus, the—the fancy cheese I got for my birthday, those meal prep containers I thought I was going crazy about— [bitter] God, and she'd help me look for them! [mocking] "Maybe you ate it and forgot?" [furious] Are you kidding me right now?

[pause] I actually, like, I genuinely thought I was losing my mind, you know? [frustrated] Started writing sticky notes on everything, and she'd be all, er, sympathetic about it. [sarcastic] "Oh that's so weird, maybe we have mice?" [shouting] MICE, Sarah? Really?

[very quietly] The thing is, if she'd just asked... [trailing off] I mean, honestly, I would've shared. [upset] But it's the lying that's just—ugh, every single time, hmm, pretending to be confused about where stuff went. [shaky voice] Six months of making me doubt myself. 

[exhausted] So now what, right? I can't just, like, pretend I don't know. [sigh] God, rent's due next week too. [very slowly] This is going to be so awkward.
509. [pure] [sigh] Also heute haben sie's uns endlich gesagt—das automatische Wagensystem geht nächsten Monat in Betrieb. 23 von uns, einfach... weg. [bitter] Ich mein, ich wusste ja, dass es kommt, wir alle wussten es, aber es dann wirklich zu hören war, ähm, anders. [pause] Mann, 8 Jahre lang Einkaufswagen auf diesem Parkplatz einsammeln. 8 Jahre "Entschuldigung, wo ist die Toilette?" und Autos im Regen ausweichen. [laugh] Aber weißt du was? [slowly] Ich dachte die ganze Zeit, ich wäre am Boden zerstört, das war halt meine Sicherheit, oder? Aber als ich heute in diesem Pausenraum saß, fühlte ich mich eigentlich... [relieved] keine Ahnung, leichter irgendwie?

[excited] Mein Atelier steht da seit 2 Jahren quasi unberührt, weil ich nach der Arbeit immer zu kaputt bin zum Malen. [speeding up] Und jetzt denke ich an all die Leinwände, die ich grundiert aber nie angefangen hab, und diese Auftragsanfrage, die ich letzten Monat abgelehnt hab, und—[gasp softly] ach du meine Güte, ich kann mich jetzt tatsächlich für diese Künstlerresidenz bewerben. [hesitantly] Ich mein, klar, mit dem Geld wird's erstmal eng, aber... [warm] ehrlich? Als sie sagten "dein letzter Tag ist der 30.", war das Erste, was ich mir vorgestellt hab, ich an meiner Staffelei um 10 Uhr morgens an einem Dienstag. [very sincerely] Nicht wie ich hektisch Wagen schiebe, bevor der Laden aufmacht. Einfach nur... malen.
510. [pure] [warm] Schau sie dir alle zusammen an. Ich meine, ehrlich gesagt, vor einem Jahr war ich mir nicht—ich war mir nicht sicher, ob wir diesen Tag je erleben würden. [pause] Marcus da drüben mit seinen Kindern, und seine Mutter ist tatsächlich gekommen, was einfach... [happy] Gott, wie sie alle zusammen lachen, weißt du? Als wäre nie was gewesen. [short pause] Dabei ist doch alles passiert, oder? Ich weiß noch, ähm, diese erste Nacht, als er reinkam—praktisch tot, echt blau im Gesicht. [very quietly] Zwei Dosen Narcan. Und dann, äh, drei Wochen später, dasselbe. Seine Mutter, die hat damals nicht mal unsere Anrufe beantwortet. [sniffle] Aber weißt du was, er kam immer wieder zurück, hat's immer wieder versucht. Selbst wenn er rückfällig wurde, tauchte er am nächsten Tag auf, so—keine Ahnung, verlegen, aber immer noch kämpfend. [pause] Und jetzt schau mal. [laughing] Seine Tochter hat ihm gerade diese Papierkrone aufgesetzt, wo "Ein-Jahr-Champion" draufsteht, und er trägt sie tatsächlich! [empathetically] Weißt du, was mich fertigmacht? Dass wir, ähm, so viele verlieren. Aber Marcus—er hat's geschafft. [very sincerely] Sie schaffen's nicht alle, aber dieser hier schon. Und ehrlich, das ist... [trailing off] [cry] Das ist alles, wirklich. Deswegen machen wir das.
511. [en] Well, um, I know this is, [shaky voice], probably the last thing you expected, but uh, I had to try to reach out somehow, you know?
512. [en] Er, because I've been watching from afar and, [regretful], seeing you in this position, well, it made me realize how much time we've wasted, you know?
513. [en] [apologetic] No, they think I'm just here to, [nervously], present some luxury goods to the royal household, which technically I am, but obviously that's not, [clearing throat], the real reason. [sigh]
514. [en] [warm] Look, I know this is, um, [overwhelmed], incredibly difficult and I'm not expecting you to just, [very quietly], forgive everything that happened between us, but maybe we could at least, well, try to talk? [gasp softly]
515. [en] [empathetically] I understand your anger completely, and um, I know how this must, [sad], look from your perspective, but there were reasons I had to leave, er, reasons I couldn't explain then and, [slowly], maybe still can't fully explain now, you know?
516. [en] [sincerely] Because our father made it clear that, well, [upset], only one of us could have the life you're living now, and I, [passionately], couldn't be the reason you lost everything, so um, I chose to disappear instead.
517. [en] [very sad] I never hated you, not for a second, and um, [monotone], watching you from the shadows all these years, knowing you thought I abandoned you out of jealousy, well, [speeding up], it's been the hardest thing I've ever had to endure. [cough]
518. [en] [friendly] You didn't do anything wrong, ever, and I need you to, [gently], understand that completely before we go any further.
519. [en] [tearfully] Well, I'm here now, aren't I, and um, [hopeful], maybe it's not too late for us to find some way forward together, even if, er, it has to be in secret like this. [chuckle]
520. [en] [determined] Then let me be the one who does the work this time, because, um, [firmly], I've already lost twelve years with you and I won't, well, [loudly], I absolutely won't lose any more time if there's even the smallest chance we can be family again.
521. [en] Well, um, I specifically requested you because, [quietly], I remembered you always talked about wanting to work on, [bitter], authentic period homes and, er, this one needs someone who actually understands the craft.
522. [en] [coldly] Um, well, yeah. [sigh]
523. [en] [formal] The dining room needs to be finished before my mother visits next month.
524. [en] The previous contractor said it would only take, [dismissive], a week but then disappeared after seeing the plaster damage.
525. [en] [defensive] Look, um, I wouldn't have called you if there were, well, any other qualified specialists in town who understood, er, Victorian authenticity.
526. [en] [stern] There's nothing to fix because we already, [regretful], established five years ago that we wanted completely different things.
527. [en] And you wanted to spend forever working with your hands in, [condescending], old houses that would never pay the bills.
528. [en] [surprised] You always said you'd never want the responsibility of managing people or dealing with business paperwork.
529. [en] [melancholic] Meanwhile I'm living alone in this massive house that, [very quietly], echoes every footstep because I chose preservation over, [shaky voice], actual living. [long pause]
530. [en] I mean, um, maybe I just needed to see if, well, the walls we put up between us were as permanent as, [trembling], the ones I'm trying to restore in this, er, empty house.
