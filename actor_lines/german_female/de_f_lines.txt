Customer: So um, I just saw my credit limit was... cut? Like, from ten thousand to basically... um, three?
1. Oh, um, I'm—I'm really sorry to hear about that, let me just, uh, pull up your account here... okay so I'm seeing account number ACC-7739-BK21 and, um, yes I can see the—the adjustment that was made, I mean, er, the credit limit change on October 15th.
Customer: October fifteenth. And nobody thought to, uh... tell me about this?
2. I'm so—I'm really sorry about the, um, the communication issue there, that's definitely not—I mean we should have—let me check if there was supposed to be, uh, an email sent... okay so it shows notification ID NTF-882294 was, er, generated but I'm not seeing a delivery confirmation which is, um, concerning.
Customer: So basically you're telling me that, um, your system just... didn't work. Great.
3. Right right.
Customer: Um, can you just, like, tell me WHY this happened? I've been a customer for, uh, twelve years, never missed a... wait no, thirteen years.
4. Of course, um, let me—so I'm looking at the, uh, the review notes here and, er, it looks like there was an automated risk assessment on, um, September 30th, reference number REF-5521-QM, and it—well it flagged some, uh, some changes in your credit utilization patterns across, I mean, not just our card but...
Customer: Changes in my... what changes? I use it the same way I always—
5. So the—I'm sorry, let me just—the system is showing, um, increased utilization on external accounts, and, uh, there were three new credit inquiries in August which, er, triggered our review process under policy code POL-7782-A.
Customer: Three inquiries because I was, um, refinancing my mortgage! That's not—do you know how much I spend with you people every year?
6. I completely—I understand your frustration and, um, I can see you're one of our, uh, our valued customers with, er, let me see... lifetime spending of—oh wow, um, significant amount here in transaction history TXN-9982743 through TXN-9997856.
Customer: Uh, so can you just... fix this then? Like, now?
7. I wish I could just—um, I mean the system doesn't let me directly override but, er, what I can do is—let me submit an expedited review request, that's form FRM-3387-EX, and, uh, normally these take five to seven business days but I'm marking it as priority.
Customer: Five to seven... I need my regular limit back, um, tomorrow. I have business expenses that—
8. Okay okay.
Customer: Look, just, uh... transfer me to someone who can actually, like, do something about this.
9. I—I understand and, um, I can definitely escalate this to our, er, credit review specialists but, uh, they're going to need to do the same review process using case number CSE-4429-RV71, it's just that they have, um, slightly more options for temporary adjustments while the review is pending.
Customer: Slightly more options. Um, fine, whatever, just... do that then.
10. Of course, I'm, uh, initiating the transfer now and, er, I'm adding detailed notes to ticket TKT-8837-LP so they'll have all the—the context about your, um, your concerns and the refinancing situation, and I'm really sorry again about this whole...
Customer: Um, hello, I'm so sorry to bother you but, uh, I think I made a mistake on your website?
11. Oh no worries at all! So, um, let me just... pull up your account here and, uh, we'll get this sorted right away. Can you, um, tell me what happened?
Customer: Well, let me see here... I was trying to order this, um, this sweater for my grandson and hmm, I think I clicked something twice?
12. Okay okay, so basically, um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, look up any recent orders you've placed. And, um, if you have your email handy? I can, like, search that way and make sure we catch everything.
Customer: Oh I'm just... I'm sorry, I'm not very good with computers. It's, uh, it's margaret.rose at gmail.
13. Perfect! So, um, I'm seeing here... oh! Yeah, so basically you've got, uh, two orders here. Order number ORD-4429-BK and, um, another one that's ORD-4431-BK. Both for the, uh, navy blue sweater in size medium. Is that what happened?
Customer: Yes! Um, that's exactly it. I didn't mean to, I just, er, the button didn't seem to work so I clicked again.
14. So, um, here's what I'm gonna do for you, and like, I want to make sure this never happens again, okay? First thing, uh, I'm canceling that duplicate order right now. The second one, ORD-4431-BK.
Customer: Oh thank goodness. So that means, um, I'll only be charged once then?
15. Exactly! So, um, you'll only be charged for the first order. And, uh, here's what else I'm doing... I'm adding a note to your account, RCP-88291-Q, that basically, um, flags any duplicate orders in the future. So like, the system will catch it automatically.
Customer: That's very kind but, hmm, what if I actually want to order two of something next time?
16. Oh that's, um, that's such a good question! So basically, uh, if you intentionally order multiples, you can just, um, change the quantity in your cart. But if two separate orders come through, like, within five minutes? The system will, uh, send you a confirmation email first.
Customer: Um, okay so that means... I should wait for an email if it happens again?
17. Yes! And, um, you know what? I'm also gonna, uh, make sure to send you a confirmation for this cancellation. So like, you'll get an email with reference number CFM-7264-MRX in about, um, five minutes or so.
Customer: I'm sorry, I'm just... er, worried because last time I ordered online somewhere else, um, they still charged me twice.
18. So, um, I totally understand that concern. And like, here's what I want you to know... if you see, uh, if you see any double charge on your statement? You call us immediately. I'm putting a priority flag, um, PRT-9983-Z on your account right now.
Customer: Oh, well that's... hmm, that's actually really reassuring. Um, thank you for being so patient with me.
19. Are you kidding? You're, um, you're doing great! And honestly, uh, this happens like... so many times a day. The website should be, um, clearer about when an order goes through. I'm actually gonna, uh, submit feedback about that using ticket TKT-4401-WG.
Customer: Well, um, next time I'll know to just wait a moment and, er, check my email first I suppose.
20. Exactly! And, um, remember that reference number I gave you? CFM-7264-MRX? So basically, uh, keep that just in case, but you should be, like, totally fine. Your grandson's gonna, um, love that sweater!
Customer: Um, look. Need my 401k. Now. Uh, how fast?
21. Okay okay, so let me just—let me pull up your account here, um, I'll need to verify some information first, and then we can, uh, we can definitely discuss your withdrawal options, just one moment while I access the system...
Customer: No no. Um. How. Fast. Er, just tell me days.
22. Right, so, um, typically—typically it's going to be, uh, five to seven business days for processing, but that's—sorry, I mean that's after we submit the request which, um, which takes about two days itself, so you're looking at maybe, hmm, nine days total?
Customer: Nine?! Uh, that's... Let me think here. Rent's due. Um, Monday.
23. I understand, I—I really do understand the urgency here, and um, between you and me? There might be a way to, uh, to expedite this a bit, your account number is RET-401K-88293-W and I can see you've been contributing for, hmm, six years?
Customer: Six years. Yeah. So? Um, faster how?
24. Well, so, um, if we process this as a—as a hardship withdrawal instead of a standard one, uh, we can get that down to, hmm, let me check here, three to four days with form HRD-2847-A, but you'd need to, um, provide some documentation...
Customer: Okay so wait. Um. Hardship. Er, what counts?
25. Right right, so, uh, eviction prevention definitely—definitely qualifies, and I can see in your file here, account RET-88293-W shows, um, consistent contributions, so you'd qualify for up to, hmm, let me calculate, up to $14,500 immediate access...
Customer: Fourteen... Hmm, okay so that means... Um. Yeah. Need it.
26. Perfect, so—so what I'm going to do here is, um, I'm going to email you form HRD-2847-A right now, and uh, here's the thing, if you can get that back to me within, hmm, within the next two hours? I can slip it into today's batch...
Customer: Two hours?! I'm... Er, I'm at work. Warehouse. Can't just—
27. Okay okay, I hear you, um, let me—sorry, let me think here... What if, uh, what if I pre-fill most of it for you using the information from RET-88293-W, and you just, um, you just need to sign and attach one document, maybe a—a rent notice or utility bill?
Customer: Um, yeah. Okay. So just sign? Er... That's it?
28. Well, hmm, mostly yes, but—but I should mention, um, there's a ten percent penalty for early withdrawal, so on $14,500 you'd lose, uh, $1,450, plus um, plus taxes, but given your situation...
Customer: Right. Penalties. Course there are. Um. Whatever. Send it.
29. Already—already sending now to your email on file, and um, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm putting a priority flag PRI-EXPEDITE-7739 on your account, so when it comes back, uh, it'll jump the queue, technically I'm not supposed to but, hmm, you sound like you really need this...
Customer: Yeah I... Hmm, thank you. Really. Um, next time I'll plan better.
30. No no, hey, we all—we all hit rough patches, and um, that's exactly what this money is for, your confirmation number is CNF-401K-293847-EXP, and uh, once you submit that form, you should have funds by, hmm, Thursday latest, possibly Wednesday if everything processes smoothly...
Customer: Um, hi, I'm calling about a—a payment that, uh, that didn't go through?
31. Oh okay. Let me just—so basically I can pull that up for you. What's your account number or—actually, you know what, phone number works too.
Customer: It's, um, it's 555-0812. I—I run a carpet cleaning business.
32. Perfect, so... okay. Got it. Account ACC-7294-CP here and I'm seeing—oh. Right. So there was a payment attempt on, um, November 15th for $487.23 that, uh, didn't process.
Customer: Yeah, yeah, I know, um, this is so embarrassing, I—I just need to fix it.
33. No no, totally fine. Happens all the time. So basically what I need to do is—let me just—we can reprocess that today with a different card if you want?
Customer: Um, can I just, uh, use the same card? I—I deposited money yesterday.
34. Absolutely, so... hmm. Let me check. The card ending in 4782? I can run that again but, um, just so you know, if it bounces twice there's a—well, there's like a $35 fee that gets added to invoice INV-2847-NOV.
Customer: Thirty-five? That's—that's on top of what I already owe?
35. Yeah so—I mean, I'm really sorry about that—it's basically bank policy and I don't—let me see if I can—actually no, I can't waive it ahead of time. But. If it goes through. No fee.
Customer: Okay okay okay, um, just—just run it. I need my supplies account active.
36. Got it. Processing now. So this takes about... fifteen seconds? Maybe twenty? And your confirmation will be—oh wait, is your email still carpetcleanpro at gmail?
Customer: Um, yeah, that's—that's right. Is it, uh, is it going through?
37. Still processing, just... okay. Okay okay. So good news—transaction approved! Your new confirmation is TRX-98274-APPROVED and, um, your account is fully active again.
Customer: Oh thank god, um, I'm—I'm so sorry about this whole mess.
38. Seriously don't—I mean, like I said, this happens literally all the time. So basically your next auto-payment is, uh, December 15th for the same amount, reference REC-DEC-7294.
Customer: Right right, um, and my—my discount still applies? The contractor one?
39. Let me just... verify that. One sec. So your account shows—yeah, 15% contractor discount is still active under code CONT-2024-CARPET15, and that's, um, that's permanent as long as you maintain the account.
Customer: Perfect, um, thanks for—for being patient with me, I just, uh, it's been a rough week.
40. Oh totally understand. Been there. So you're all set—receipt's going to your email with reference RCP-112024-7294 and, um, if you need anything else just—you know, we're here. Have a good one.
Customer: Um, yeah, so I need to, uh, close an account—no wait, not close—um, transfer it or whatever you do when someone dies.
41. Oh. Oh I see. I'm—let me just—I'm so sorry. For your loss. Let me. Pull up. The appropriate forms. Case number BRV-88342-Q.
Customer: Can we just, um, get through this quickly? I've got—no, sorry, I have a lot to handle right now.
42. Of course of course. I think—no wait—actually I'll need. Some information first. Um. The account holder's name? And, uh, your relationship?
Customer: Martha Coleman. My mother. Look, how long is this going to take?
43. So, um, I think—probably—well it's sort of, uh, there's a process. But I'll—I'll make this. As quick as possible. Need the, um, account number? ACC-7749302-MK if you, uh, if you have it?
Customer: ACC-7749—wait, that's the checking, right? Or is that—no, checking is 7749302.
44. Right right. Um, so I need to, uh, verify—I mean, sort of confirm you're, um, authorized? Death certificate. Reference number DOC-5571-XR9. You'll need to, uh, upload that.
Customer: Um, yeah, I have it here somewhere, uh, can I just—wait, upload where exactly?
45. I'll—let me just—sending a secure link. To your email. Portal ID PTL-883290-B. Should arrive. In about. Two minutes.
Customer: Two minutes? No, I mean—sorry, can't you just, um, take the information now? Like, over the phone?
46. I think—no actually—legally we need. The document. Compliance code CMP-4428-YT requires. Physical documentation. Or digital upload.
Customer: This is ridiculous. Do you know how much money she had with you people?
47. I—I understand. This is. Um. Difficult. I'm just—I'm trying to, uh, to help. Within the, um, the regulations? It's it's not—I mean, I wish I could—
Customer: Whatever. Fine. Send your link. But this better not take weeks to process.
48. No no no. Once we, um, once we get the—uh, the certificate? Processing is, um, usually three to five—I mean, uh, business days. Reference timeline TML-9902.
Customer: Three to—wait no, you said three to five? That's not—I was told same day when I, uh, when I called yesterday.
49. Yesterday? Let me. Check the notes. Hmm. Ticket number TKT-445831-LP shows. Expedited processing. For accounts over. Certain thresholds.
Customer: So, um, then it IS same day? Or—no wait, are you saying, uh, her account doesn't qualify?
50. Actually—let me just—you're right. You're right. Account qualifies. For priority. Same day. Once documents are. Verified. It's going to be okay. I promise.
Customer: Oh thank god. I'm sorry. I think I... the website kept. Um. Crashing?
51. No worries at all, so basically this has been happening all morning—our main server cluster went down around 9 AM. Let me pull up your account real quick, what's your email address?
Customer: It's... I probably did something wrong. Maybe clicked too many times?
52. Definitely not your fault, like, we've had over 300 reports since breakfast. So what I'm seeing here is your session ID SES-44219-BK got interrupted seventeen times—that's basically a record for today.
Customer: Seventeen? Oh god. I'm sorry. I just kept... trying.
53. Hey no no, that's exactly what you should do. So your account ACC-7263-MP shows you were trying to access your recent order, is that right?
Customer: Yes. Kind of. I mean probably that's... I need to check if. The delivery?
54. Got it, so I can see order ORD-9847-TL22 here, scheduled for tomorrow. But like, here's the thing—because of all these crashes, we're actually upgrading everyone affected to expedited shipping, no charge.
Customer: Wait really? I don't. You don't have to. I mean I'm just...
55. No listen, we're going to fix this properly. Your confirmation code is now EXP-7749-RK and basically that means guaranteed delivery by 10 AM tomorrow, and I'm adding a credit of $25 to your account.
Customer: That's... I think that's too much? Maybe just. The website working is enough.
56. Look, you tried seventeen times to get through, so like, that's persistence we need to reward. Reference number for the credit is CRD-2024-8837-A.
Customer: I'm being silly. Probably everyone's calling. Sort of taking your time.
57. You're literally my favorite call today because you're so nice about it. So basically while I have you, let me check if there's anything else affected on account ACC-7263-MP... yeah, your wishlist is intact, payment methods are all good.
Customer: Oh. Thank god. I thought maybe I... lost everything?
58. Nope, everything's safe, so like all your data is backed up every hour. Your last successful save was at 8:47 AM, reference timestamp TS-084747-EST.
Customer: I just. Really needed this order. Kind of important. Sorry.
59. Hey, no apologizing, that's why we're fixing it. So I'm putting a priority flag PRI-HIGH-7263 on your account, basically means if you have ANY issues tomorrow with delivery, you call and ask for me directly—name's Jordan, employee ID EMP-4472.
Customer: That's so. I mean. Thank you? I think I'm just. Relieved.
60. Totally understand, like this morning was rough for everyone. So your updated tracking number is TRK-9847-EXPR-22 and basically you'll get texts every step of the way. We're going to make sure this gets to you perfectly, okay?
Character 1: Um, I've been staring at this Monet painting for, like, twenty minutes and I [sad] still don't get it, you know, it's just blurry flowers.
61. Oh, that's actually the whole point of impressionism - they weren't trying to paint perfect photographic details, they were capturing the feeling of a moment, the way light dances on water lilies at a specific time of day.
Character 1: So, wait, they basically made it blurry on purpose? I mean, that seems kind of... er, lazy?
62. Not lazy at all! These artists spent years studying how our eyes actually perceive color and light - they discovered that shadows aren't just gray or black, they're filled with reflected colors from everything around them.
Character 1: Hmm, I guess when you put it that way, actually, it's more like they were, uhh, scientists or something?
63. Well, they were definitely revolutionaries, though I suppose [sarcastic] the stuffy Academy painters of the time would've said, you know, they were just rebels who couldn't, um, draw properly.
Character 1: Actually, I'm [very sincerely] starting to see it now, like, the way the water kind of, err, shimmers when you don't focus directly on it.
64. Exactly! And here's what's really cool - Monet painted the same haystacks and cathedral facades dozens of times, but at different times of day and seasons, showing how the same subject completely transforms with changing light.
Character 1: Uh, that's honestly pretty obsessive, I mean, painting the same thing over and over, you know?
65. Right so, it might seem obsessive, but basically he was documenting something nobody had really, hmm, paid attention to before - how our perception of reality changes constantly throughout the day.
Character 1: Did other impressionists do that too, or was it just Monet being weird?
66. They all had their own approaches - Renoir focused on people and the joy of modern life, Degas was obsessed with movement and dancers, Caillebotte painted urban scenes from these crazy dramatic angles nobody had tried before.
Character 1: Speaking of Degas, [cough], weren't his ballet paintings kind of creepy though?
67. Okay so, that's a fair point, and honestly, [regretful] the way he depicted young dancers, um, there's definitely some uncomfortable power dynamics there that modern viewers, you know, rightfully question.
Character 1: It's just that, well, I read somewhere he was, er, hanging around backstage all the time, sort of watching them.
68. Yeah, the thing is, he had special access that, uhh, most people didn't have, and anyway, his work does capture this behind-the-scenes exhaustion and reality that, hmm, wasn't typically shown in art.
Character 1: So impressionism wasn't all pretty gardens and sunny days then?
69. Not at all - Toulouse-Lautrec painted brothels and cabarets, Caillebotte showed rain-soaked streets and urban isolation, and even Monet's later works get pretty abstract and almost turbulent.
Character 1: I think I want to see more of these paintings now, especially the weird ones.
70. That's the spirit! Once you understand they were trying to paint sensation itself rather than just copying what they saw, the whole movement becomes this incredible experiment in human perception.
Character 1: [hollow] I found something, um, inside the violin that I think, [trembling], you need to see, something that, well, shouldn't be there and I mean, [quieter], it's making me question everything about Mrs. Chen. [exhales]
71. This USB drive has military-grade encryption that, [stunned], hasn't been used since 2017 and only three organizations in the world had access to this particular protocol.
Character 1: Um, well, I don't know.
72. [careful] The metadata shows these files were, [measured], last modified two days before she died, which means she was, [darker], actively working on something that required this level of security right up until, [trailing off], the accident.
Character 1: Um, she just seemed like a lonely old woman who, [breaking], wanted her grandmother's violin restored, I mean, we talked about music for hours, about Brahms, about her childhood in Vienna.
73. [restrained] Well, I've seen this encryption signature before, um, in cases involving, [uncomfortable], international espionage, and I mean, the fact that she hid it inside an instrument suggests she knew, [grave], someone was watching her.
Character 1: [despairing] So, um, all those afternoons she spent in my workshop, well, watching me work while telling stories about her life, I mean, [hollow], none of that was real, was it, [defeated], she was just using me. [sighs heavily]
74. [gentle] People can be multiple things at once, um, and her appreciation for your craftsmanship seemed, [thoughtful], genuine even if she had, well, other motives for choosing you specifically, I mean, [softer], for trusting you with this. [pause]
Character 1: [bitter] Well, um, I spent three months bringing that violin back to life, you know, replacing the sound post, regraduating the top plate, and, [disgusted], now I find out it was just, I mean, [exhausted], a hiding place for whatever nightmare she was running from.
75. [clinical] Um, there's something else you should know, well, the encryption key appears to be, [hesitant], tied to specific frequencies, and I think, [realization dawning], the violin itself might be the key, I mean, certain notes played in sequence.
Character 1: [stunned] The Brahms sonata she kept, [disbelieving], humming while I worked, the one she said her grandmother played, [shaking], during the war to keep children calm in bomb shelters.
76. [excited] That could be it, the frequency pattern from that, [focused], specific piece might unlock these files and reveal whatever she was, [tense], protecting or hiding.
Character 1: [resigned] She left me a recording of herself playing it, said it was, [emotional], payment for the restoration work since her accounts were, [quieter], frozen after her death, but now I realize it was probably, [despairing], instructions.
77. [urgent] We need to analyze that recording immediately because whoever else is, [worried], looking for these files won't stop just because she's, [grim], dead, and they might already know about, [fearful], you.
Character 1: I mean, there have been people asking questions at the shop lately, um, about her violin, about whether she left anything else behind, well, [disturbed], I thought they were just estate collectors.
78. [firm] Pack whatever you need because, um, we're moving you somewhere safe while I work on, [determined], cracking this. [decisive]
Character 1: The violin is still in my workshop, sitting on, [anguished], the bench where she used to watch me work, where we talked about, [broken], everything except what actually mattered.
79. [quiet] I'll send someone to retrieve it, um, discreetly, but I mean, right now we need to, [urgent], leave before they connect you to those files. [stands]
Character 1: This morning I was worried about matching the, [hollow], original varnish color and now I'm running from people who might, [terrified], kill me for restoring an old woman's violin, for doing my, [despairing], job.
80. Well, um, I know.
Character 1: Well, um, I never thought I'd see the, [bitter], mighty Officer Chen sitting on the sidewalk with a, [disbelieving], cardboard sign begging for spare change, I mean, especially not outside my restaurant.
81. Six months ago you were selling tacos from that, [hollow], illegal cart and now you own this place?
Character 1: [cynical] Um, well, yeah.
82. [defensive] Look, uh, I was just doing my, [exhausted], job back then when I shut you down, you know, following orders from the health department about, [resigned], unlicensed vendors even though your food was, [quiet], cleaner than most restaurants.
Character 1: [questioning] So, umm, what happened to you anyway, I mean, how does an enforcer end up, [stunned], homeless? [pause]
83. [measured] Turns out reporting corruption in the department makes you, [sardonic], unemployable anywhere that matters. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: The same corruption that had you shutting down, [angry], immigrant food carts while letting corporate chains operate without permits?
84. [haunted] Every cart I shut down was someone's, [guilty], dream being crushed and I did it fifty-seven, [breaking], times before I finally couldn't, [choked up], stomach it anymore. [long pause]
Character 1: [cold] Well, um, you cost me everything I had saved for, [trembling], ten years so, I mean, forgive me if I don't, [harsh], shed tears for your conscience finally showing up.
85. [desperate] Um, I know, er, okay?
Character 1: You stood there watching while they threw my grandmother's, [pained], recipes in the dumpster along with all my equipment. [sighs heavily]
86. Those recipes are what made this, [looking around], place successful though, right, because I can smell the same, [nostalgic], spices from that day and it's been, [regretful], haunting me ever since.
Character 1: [conflicted] Look, umm, I should hate you and, well, part of me still, [struggling], does but seeing you like this doesn't, [uncomfortable], feel as good as I thought it would, you know? [trailing off]
87. [weary] I mean, karma has a way of, uhh, serving justice better than any, [philosophical], court system ever could, right?
Character 1: [reluctant] There's a dishwashing position that just, [cautious], opened up in the kitchen if you're willing to work for someone whose, [pointed], life you tried to destroy.
88. [shocked] After everything I did to you, after the, [disbelieving], raids and the fines and the humiliation, you'd actually, [emotional], offer me work?
Character 1: [firm] The old me would have walked, [thoughtful], past you just like you walked past my tears that day but success taught me, [wise], something about second chances.
89. [grateful] Maybe redemption starts with scrubbing the, [hopeful], pots that cook the food I once tried to ban. [voice breaking]
Character 1: [decisive] Be here at five AM tomorrow and don't make me, [warning], regret this because I'm already questioning my, [uncertain], sanity for even suggesting it. [exhales]
90. Five AM with clean clothes and whatever's left of my, [determined], dignity ready to wash dishes for the American dream I once, [ironic], tried to crush. [chuckles darkly]
Customer: Ähm, hallo, ich—ich rufe wegen einer, äh, Kreditkartenreklamation an? Meine Kundin hat—warte, sorry, gegen mich.
91. Oh, ähm, das tut mir wirklich leid, dass Sie das durchmachen müssen, lassen Sie mich mal eben, äh, Ihr Händlerkonto aufrufen... okay, also ich brauche Ihre Händler-ID-Nummer, die sollte mit MID- anfangen
Customer: Richtig, das ist äh... MID... warten Sie, ich hab's aufgeschrieben—nein, das ist die andere—MID-4782-PK.
92. Perfekt, danke schön, also ich sehe hier MID-4782-PK und, ähm, es tut mir wirklich leid, aber es liegt tatsächlich eine Reklamation vom 23. Oktober über 3.200 € vor, Reklamationsnummer DSP-8847-WQ92, und äh, anscheinend behauptet die Karteninhaberin, die Leistung sei nicht erbracht worden?
Customer: Aber ich—ich hab doch für sie gekocht! Drei Tage lang, ihre ganze Dinnerparty...
93. Nein nein, ich glaube Ihnen absolut, es tut mir so leid, dass Ihnen das passiert, ähm, diese wohlhabenden Kunden können halt... na ja, jedenfalls, die gute Nachricht ist, Sie haben 10 Tage ab Benachrichtigung, um Ihre Widerspruchsdokumente über unser Portal einzureichen unter disputes.merchantportal.com/case/DSP-8847-WQ92
Customer: Zehn Tage? Ähm, das ist... werden die mein Geld bis dahin einfrieren oder...?
94. Also leider—und das tut mir, äh, wirklich leid—wurden die 3.200 € bereits vorläufig von Ihrem Konto abgebucht bis zur Klärung, Ihr verfügbarer Saldo sollte diese Sperrung unter Referenz HLD-9923-TK anzeigen
Customer: Oh Gott. Okay. Ähm. Durchatmen. Was—was für Beweise brauchen Sie denn genau?
95. Also, ähm, hier ist was normalerweise am besten funktioniert—und ich hab schon viele davon positiv ausgehen sehen—Sie brauchen Ihren unterschriebenen Vertrag, alle E-Mails oder SMS über die Veranstaltung, Fotos vom Dinner falls Sie welche haben, und fügen Sie auf jeden Fall Ihre Rechnung INV-welche Nummer Sie auch verwendet haben bei
Customer: Ich fotografiere alles! Ähm, für mein Portfolio, also das ist... das ist doch gut, oder?
96. Oh, das ist ja sogar perfekt, genau, Richter lieben Fotos mit Zeitstempel, und ähm, da Sie bei uns seit 2019 als verifizierte Händlerin geführt werden, Kontoerstellung zeigt März 2019, MID-4782-PK, diese Glaubwürdigkeit hilft Ihrem Fall auf jeden Fall
Customer: Sind Sie sicher? Weil das könnte wirklich—ich meine, meine Miete und...
97. Es tut mir so, äh, es tut mir wirklich leid, dass Sie diesen Stress durchmachen, und ich kann keine Versprechen machen, aber ehrlich? Nach meiner Erfahrung, wenn Köchinnen Fotos und Verträge haben, liegt die Gewinnrate bei so 85%, stellen Sie nur sicher, dass alles für Fall DSP-8847-WQ92 vor dem 2. November hochgeladen wird
Customer: Ähm, okay also, äh, blöde Frage aber... die können doch nicht so, schlechte Bewertungen hinterlassen während das läuft...?
98. Also das ist, ähm, eigentlich komplett getrennt vom Reklamationsverfahren, aber äh, ich meine, unter uns gesagt? Machen Sie jetzt von allem Screenshots, denn wenn das die Sorte ist, die falsche Reklamationen einreicht...
Customer: Stimmt. Ja. Sie, äh, sie haben meinen Lachs dauernd als „gewöhnlich" bezeichnet, aber drei Portionen gegessen, also...
99. Ach, tut mir leid, aber da musste ich ein bisschen lachen, ähm, okay also schauen Sie, erwähnen Sie in Ihrer Widerlegung genau was serviert wurde, Mengen, alle Sonderwünsche die gemacht wurden, verweisen Sie auf Ihre ursprüngliche Rechnungsnummer in der Dokumentation, und unser Prüfungsteam bei case.review@disputecenter, die lesen wirklich alles durch
Customer: Das hilft mir tatsächlich. Ähm. Sorry für die—Sie wissen schon, die Panik und...
100. Oh bitte, entschuldigen Sie sich gar nicht, dafür bin ich doch da, und ähm, ehrlich, Sie gehen damit viel besser um als die meisten anderen, denken Sie nur dran, alles bei DSP-8847-WQ92 hochzuladen, das Portal akzeptiert Dateien bis 10MB pro Stück, und äh, falls Sie noch was brauchen, meine Agenten-ID ist SUP-7739-M, ich drücke Ihnen wirklich die Daumen.
Customer: Ich brauche ein Transkript. Von letztem Dienstag.
101. Oh! Ähm, natürlich, ich kann Ihnen da auf jeden Fall helfen. Lassen Sie mich nur, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und... hmm, okay, also ich sehe... ja, da haben wir's. Kann ich Ihre, ähm, Kontonummer oder Telefonnummer zur Verifizierung bekommen?
Customer: Fünf fünf fünf. Acht sieben zwei. Neun vier eins sechs.
102. Ausgezeichnet, vielen Dank! Okay, also, ähm, ich hab Ihr Konto hier und, äh, mal sehen... Ich sehe einen Anruf am Dienstag um, hmm, sieht aus wie 14:47 Uhr, Referenznummer REF-92847-TL, ist das der, den Sie suchen?
Customer: Das ist das ist der richtige. Ja.
103. Wunderbar! Also, ähm, die Sache ist die - ich kann Ihnen das Transkript auf jeden Fall besorgen, also, überhaupt kein Problem. Normalerweise schicken wir die per E-Mail innerhalb von, äh, etwa 24 Stunden, aber hmm, mal schauen ob ich... wissen Sie was eigentlich? Ich könnte das vielleicht für Sie beschleunigen...
Customer: Ich brauche es. Jetzt. Falls möglich.
104. Oh, ähm, ich verstehe vollkommen, lassen Sie mich, äh, mal schauen was ich hier zaubern kann. Also die Transkript-Anfrage-ID ist, ähm, TRQ-58219-KC und ich prüfe gerade... hmm, unsere Express-Optionen... okay, also...
Customer: Ähm, hören Sie, es tut mir leid, ich—ich brauche das einfach wirklich heute.
105. Nein nein, bitte entschuldigen Sie sich nicht! Ich höre, dass das, ähm, wirklich wichtig für Sie ist und, äh, ehrlich? Ich werde hier alles Mögliche tun. Lassen Sie mich nur... okay, also wenn ich das als Priorität markiere mit Code PRI-77463-M, dann sollte das... ja! Ich kann es Ihnen innerhalb einer Stunde zukommen lassen.
Customer: Innerhalb einer Stunde? Wirklich?
106. Absolut! Ich meine, ähm, eigentlich sollen wir auf die Manager-Genehmigung für Express-Transkripte warten, aber, äh, unter uns gesagt? Ihr Dienstag-Anruf war mit, hmm, mal sehen... Agentin Maria, und sie hat wirklich detaillierte Notizen im Ticket TKT-30298-VP hinterlassen, also kann ich einfach...
Customer: Ich erinnere mich irgendwie, dass sie etwas gesagt hat. Über meine Garantie.
107. Oh ja! Ähm, also ich schaue mir gerade Marias Notizen an und, äh, sie hat wirklich alles gründlich dokumentiert. Die Garantie-Diskussion ist, hmm, genau hier in Abschnitt drei des Anrufprotokolls, Referenz WRN-66012-QD, und das wird alles in Ihrem Transkript sein.
Customer: Okay okay. Ähm, danke. Ich hab wahrscheinlich überreagiert.
108. Oh mein Gott, nein! Also, Sie sind so geduldig und, ähm, ich verstehe total, warum Sie das schnell brauchen. Äh, wissen Sie was eigentlich? Während ich das mit Express-Code RSH-44819-BX bearbeite, kann ich auch, hmm, ich kann Ihnen auch die Garantie-Details separat schicken, wenn das hilft?
Customer: Das ist... ja. Bitte.
109. Perfekt! Also, ähm, ich schicke beide Dokumente an Ihre hinterlegte E-Mail-Adresse, und äh, die Transkript-Bestätigung ist CNF-90156-JK, und dann die Garantie-Zusammenfassung ist, hmm, moment... WSM-28374-NP. Sie sollten beides innerhalb von, äh, eigentlich wahrscheinlich eher 30 Minuten jetzt bekommen!
Customer: Es tut mir leid, dass ich... schroff war. Vorhin.
110. Oh bitte, ehrlich, Sie waren wunderbar! Ähm, ich wünschte nur, ich hätte es Ihnen noch schneller besorgen können, aber äh, mit unseren System-Beschränkungen... na ja! Beide Dokumente werden jetzt verarbeitet unter Batch-Nummer BCH-51692-TG und Sie bekommen eine E-Mail, sobald sie fertig sind. Gibt es, ähm, noch etwas anderes, wobei ich helfen kann, während wir Sie noch dran haben?
Customer: Ähm, hallo, ich, äh, rufe für meinen Papa an? Er ist—also, ich meine, er hat mich gebeten, wegen seinem Konto anzurufen?
111. Ah natürlich, da helfe ich Ihnen sehr gerne weiter! Also ich muss nur—eigentlich muss ich erst das Konto verifizieren, haben Sie die Kontonummer zur Hand? Die sollte mit ACC anfangen und dann ein paar Zahlen.
Customer: Oh, ähm, ja, ich glaube es ist... ACC-4829-JK? Oder warte, vielleicht ist das eine 6, keine 9?
112. Okay also—ich schau mal—eigentlich ACC-4826-JK, sehen Sie vielleicht diese Nummer? Manchmal sehen die 6en und 9en auf unseren Abrechnungen wirklich ähnlich aus, und ich hab hier ein Konto mit dieser Nummer.
Customer: Ja! Entschuldigung, ähm, das ist es wahrscheinlich. Ich hab das noch nie gemacht.
113. Nein nein, Sie machen das super, wirklich! Also, ähm, jetzt muss ich nur noch verifizieren—oh warte, eigentlich lass mich kurz—da Sie für Ihren Papa anrufen, ist er zufällig bei Ihnen? Nur damit ich, Sie wissen schon, seine mündliche Erlaubnis bekomme, über das Konto zu sprechen.
Customer: Ähm, er ist so, irgendwie da? Er fährt gerade, also, äh, kann ich ihn kurz auf Lautsprecher stellen?
114. Perfekt, ja, das funktioniert super!
Customer: Papa sagt, es ist okay, er sagt, ähm, ich soll Ihnen sagen, der Sicherheitscode ist, äh, Blue42?
115. Okay also, ähm, Blue42, lass mich mal—eigentlich ist das—hmm, ich sehe hier, dass das Passwort für Konto ACC-4826-JK, äh, 6 Zeichen haben sollte, also vielleicht gibt's noch einen Teil dazu? Manchmal vergessen Leute, dass sie am Ende noch Zahlen hinzugefügt haben.
Customer: Oh! Ähm, vielleicht Blue42Star? Glaube ich? Er nickt, also, ja, wahrscheinlich das.
116. Blue42Star, perfekt! Gut also, ähm, das ist durchgegangen und, äh, jetzt kann ich Ihnen bei allem helfen, was Sie zum Konto brauchen, also was kann ich heute für Sie tun?
Customer: Also, ähm, da ist halt diese Abbuchung? Es sind 487€ und, äh, wir wissen nicht—ich meine, er weiß nicht, wofür das ist?
117. Gut, lass mich das mal aufrufen und—okay also ich sehe eine Abbuchung über 487€ gebucht am 15. mit Referenznummer REF-90284-TXN, und, ähm, es sieht aus, als wäre das von StreamPlus Entertainment, sagt Ihnen das irgendwas?
Customer: Ähm, nein? Ich meine, vielleicht? Warte mal, wissen Sie, ob das so ein Streamingdienst oder so ist?
118. Also ja, StreamPlus ist—lass mich kurz nachschauen—das ist eigentlich, ähm, ein Streaming-Bundle-Service, der so zwölf verschiedene Plattformen beinhaltet, und laut Transaktions-ID TXN-90284-B wäre das für ein Jahresabo, das am 15. verlängert wurde.
Customer: Oh Gott, ähm, das ist dann wahrscheinlich meins. Ich glaube, ich hab mich letztes Jahr für eine Testversion angemeldet? Sorry, das ist, äh, peinlich.
119. Oh nein nein, machen Sie sich keine Gedanken, das passiert ständig! Also, ähm, da Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach der Abbuchung mit Bestätigung CFC-2847-Annual sind, kann ich eigentlich—also, mal sehen, welche Optionen wir haben—ich kann einen Erstattungsantrag für Sie einreichen, wenn Sie es kündigen möchten?
Customer: Wirklich? Ähm, ja bitte! Mein Papa bringt mich um, wenn—ich meine, sorry, ja, das wäre wirklich super, danke.
120. Auf jeden Fall, also ich bearbeite jetzt, ähm, diese Stornierung mit Fallnummer CSE-48920-RF, und Sie sollten die Rückerstattung in etwa 3-5 Werktagen sehen, und, äh, ich schicke auch eine Bestätigungsmail an die hinterlegte Adresse, damit Sie alles dokumentiert haben, okay?
Customer: Um, hi, I just, uh, signed up for your loyalty thing and, er, I'm trying to understand the terms?
121. Oh yeah, the—let me just—okay so the VIP Rewards program, member ID VRP-8847-QN, and honestly? The terms are a bit—I mean, they're ridiculous, even I think so.
Customer: Right, um, so like, what happens with my points if I, uh, don't use them?
122. So they expire—wait no, sorry—they used to expire after 6 months but now it's—let me check—code POL-2024-EXP shows 12 months, which is still kinda short if you ask me.
Customer: Um, okay, that's, er, better than I thought, but uh, what about returns?
123. Yeah so, um, this is where it gets—I mean, honestly annoying—if you return something, um, the points get deducted from account PTS-BALANCE-01, and uh, if you already used them? They charge you.
Customer: They charge me? Um, that seems, uh, I mean next time I'll just, er, not bother with points then.
124. Right? It's—look, between us—total nonsense. The system ref TRM-SECTION-7B makes it so complicated when it should just be simple.
Customer: Well, um, at least you're being honest about it, uh, I appreciate that.
125. So here's what I—actually wait—let me tell you the workaround, um, if you use code SAVE-POINTS-90 when redeeming, uh, it protects them for returns, but they don't advertise this.
Customer: Um, really? That's, uh, actually helpful, er, thanks for telling me.
126. Yeah the whole—I mean—document DOC-LOYALTY-2024 is 47 pages long, who reads that? So um, anything else that's, uh, confusing you about it?
Customer: Er, what about, um, the birthday rewards thing, uh, how does that work exactly?
127. Oh that's actually—wait, let me—yeah so code BDAY-BONUS-200 gives double points, but here's the dumb part, you gotta activate it yourself, it's not automatic.
Customer: Um, of course it's not automatic, uh, why would anything just, er, work simply?
128. I know—it's like—we have your birthdate in file DOB-FIELD-ACTIVE, the system knows, but no, you still gotta manually click the button, it's so backwards.
Customer: Well, um, at least now I know, uh, better than finding out after missing it.
129. Exactly, and um, while we're at it—the tier system? Code TIER-SILVER-500, uh, you need 500 points for Silver but they don't—I mean, the benefits are barely different from basic.
Customer: Um, good to know, er, I'll just, uh, not stress about reaching tiers then.
130. Smart move, honestly just, um, use the points for discounts—code DISC-APPLY-10—and uh, don't overthink the rest, that's what I tell everyone who actually listens.
Customer: Also. Hab meine Rechnung bekommen. 37 Dollar in... mysteriösen Gebühren.
131. Oh, ähm, okay also lass mich mal eben, äh, dein Konto hier aufrufen und ich werd, ähm... was ist die... ich brauch mal kurz deine Kontonummer, wenn du sie hast?
Customer: Ja. Die ist, ähm... 4-4-2... 8-1-9.
132. Perfekt, hab's, also das ist Konto ACC-442819 und ich kann sehen—oh wow, ja da sind, ähm, da sind definitiv einige Gebühren hier die, äh, nicht typisch sind.
Customer: Natürlich sind da welche. Kannst du einfach... Zeile für Zeile.
133. Klar, ja, also ähm, von oben angefangen, da ist eine, äh, was sie eine "Service Assessment Fee" nennen für 12,50 Dollar unter Code FEE-8829A, was, ähm, honestly I have no idea what that even...
Customer: Service Assessment. Für welchen Service genau...
134. Ja, ich weiß, es ist—lass mich da mal reinschauen, ähm, also es sieht aus als wär es, äh, an dein Oktober-Statement gebunden, Referenz REF-10247B, und es ist angeblich für, ähm, "Kontowartung" was einfach nur...
Customer: Kontowartung. Klar. Was ist, ähm, was ist das nächste.
135. Also das nächste ist, äh, noch besser—15 Dollar für etwas das sie, ähm, "regulatory compliance adjustment" nennen mit Transaktion TXN-559823C, which I think is just their way of, äh, du weißt schon...
Customer: Their way of taking fifteen bucks. Genau.
136. Ziemlich genau. Ähm, und dann ist da diese, äh, 9,50 Dollar Gebühr hier bezeichnet als, hmm, was ist das Wort das sie benutzen... "network optimization fee" unter Code NET-7734X.
Customer: Network optimization. Ich bin Elektrikerin. Ich... optimiere keine Netzwerke.
137. Nein, ich weiß, es ist, ähm, es ist lächerlich ehrlich. Das sind alles nur, äh, diese automatischen Gebühren die das System, ähm, hinzufügt und die halbe Zeit können wir sie nicht mal, äh, richtig erklären weil sie so...
Customer: Schau, ich weiß das ist nicht deine Schuld. System's just...
138. Das weiß ich zu schätzen, wirklich, und ähm, weißt du was? Lass mich, äh, lass mich mal schauen was ich hier tatsächlich machen kann, because these fees under codes FEE-8829A, TXN-559823C, and NET-7734X are, ähm, technisch gesehen diskretionär.
Customer: Diskretionär. Das heißt du kannst sie einfach, ähm... entfernen?
139. Ja also, ähm, ich geb gerade eine, äh, eine Gutschrift-Anfrage ein, Referenznummer CRD-994521M, and honestly between you and me? Diese Gebühren sind, ähm, die sind Müll und wir wissen es beide.
Customer: Ja. Sind sie wirklich. Also alle 37 werden...
140. Alle 37 Dollar gutgeschrieben, ähm, sollte innerhalb von, äh, 2 bis 3 Tagen erscheinen unter Bestätigung CON-8847P, und ich hab auch, ähm, eine Notiz hinzugefügt um dein Konto von diesen, äh, "Optimierungs"-Gebühren in Zukunft auszunehmen.
Customer: I need—wait no. Um. The bill. Wrong. I think. Maybe wrong.
141. Okay, um, I can definitely help you with that. So, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, can you maybe give me your account number? It should be, um, right at the top of your bill, starts with ACC.
Customer: ACC. Um. Nine. Four. Uh—sorry, I mean—nine zero four. Seven seven. Two.
142. Perfect. Got it. ACC-904772. So, um, I'm looking at your account now and, uh, I can see your latest bill here. Can you maybe tell me what, um, what part looks wrong to you?
Customer: The... how do I—um. Extra money? I pay. Same always. Now is, uh, more.
143. Oh, okay okay. So, um, you're saying the amount is, uh, higher than usual? I think I see what you mean. So your regular monthly charge is, um, usually $89.99, but this month it's showing, uh, $127.43. Is that what you're, um, asking about?
Customer: Yes. Exactly yes. Why this. I don't—I mean, um, I didn't change. Nothing.
144. Right right. So, um, let me just. Check here. And, uh, actually I can see there's, hmm, there's an overage charge. From, um, data usage? On October 15th, there's a charge code OVR-8823-DT for, uh, $37.44.
Customer: Data? But I—no wait. Sorry. I don't, um, understand this word. Over?
145. Oh sure sure. Um, so basically, overage means, uh, you went over your limit? Like, um, you have a certain amount you can use each month. And if you use more than that. You know. They charge extra.
Customer: But I. Same things. Always same. Check email. That's—um, that's all.
146. Hmm, okay so, um, I'm looking at your usage details here and, uh, on October 15th there was, like, a really big spike? Um, almost 3GB in one day. Transaction log shows TXN-994837-MB. Do you maybe remember, um, downloading anything big that day? Or, uh, watching videos maybe?
Customer: October fifteen. Um. Wait I—my son. Visited. He use—he used? Probably. The phone.
147. Ah, okay okay. That makes sense. Kids and phones. Right? So, um, what I can do is, uh, I can maybe add a note to your account? Reference number REF-7749-CS. And, um, since this was kind of a one-time thing. I think. I might be able to get you, uh, a courtesy credit?
Customer: Please. Yes. I—I need this. Um. Fixed. Money is. Tight? Is that—correct word?
148. Absolutely. I totally understand. Money being tight. I mean. We all feel that. Right? So, um, let me just submit this request here and, uh, I'll need approval code but, hmm, usually these get approved pretty quick.
Customer: How long? Sorry I—um, when I see. The money. Back?
149. So, um, once it's approved—and I'm putting rush code RSH-662 on it—you'll see the credit in, uh, probably about 3 to 5 business days? It'll show up as, um, adjustment ADJ-8827-OCT on your next statement.
Customer: Thank you. Really. I was—um, so worry. Worried? Thank you. Much.
150. Oh, you're so welcome! And, um, hey, your English is great by the way. I know it's, uh, it's hard explaining technical stuff in another language. If you ever need help again, just, um, reference this case number CSE-10847-B and we'll, you know, have all this history. Take care!
Customer: Also ich schätze mal, ähm, meine Rate ist gerade... hochgegangen? Hab's so irgendwie auf meiner Rechnung bemerkt.
151. Oh. Ähm. Lass mich mal eben... Ich ruf gleich mal Ihr Konto auf und... hmm... okay ich sehe hier Kontonummer ACT-7749-NL und, äh, ich werd mal... lass mich nachschauen was passiert ist...
Customer: Wahrscheinlich so eine, äh... wie heißt das noch... automatische Sache, oder?
152. Also, ähm, ich schau mir das gerade an... und ich will sichergehen dass wir... äh... Ihre vorherige Rate von 49,99 ist abgelaufen am... hmm... ersten Oktober und... ich sehe sie ist auf 74,99 hochgesprungen was... das ist nicht...
Customer: Natürlich. Ich meine, äh, warum sollte mir auch jemand... Bescheid sagen.
153. Nein nein, das ist nicht... ähm, das regel ich jetzt. Wirklich. Also was passiert ist, äh, Promocode PROMO-8821-X ist abgelaufen und das System hat einfach... aber das lass ich nicht so...
Customer: Ja. Ähm. Ist halt... ich glaub ich hab's irgendwie satt.
154. Warte. Nicht doch. Ähm. Ich geb gerade... äh... Override-Anfrage ORR-5543-KP92 ein um... hmm... ich will Sie davor schützen dass das nochmal passiert also...
Customer: Klar. Von mir aus. Wird wahrscheinlich eh nicht, ähm... nicht halten.
155. Nein, hör zu, ich... äh... ich werd tatsächlich... ähm... Benachrichtigungscode NTF-2010-B auf Ihrem Konto einrichten damit Sie nächstes Mal bei Ratenänderungen... ähmm... drei verschiedene Benachrichtigungen bekommen und ich mach auch...
Customer: Äh, drei Benachrichtigungen für das... für das Ding das ich sowieso nicht, ähm, lesen werde?
156. Ich weiß Sie sind... schau, ich versteh's. Aber ähm, ich gewähre auch eine Gutschrift... äh... Referenznummer CRD-9984-TK22 für die Differenz. 225 Dollar. Rückwirkend für drei Monate weil die hätten...
Customer: Warte. Ähm. Du machst tatsächlich... das ist irgendwie... echtes Geld?
157. Sehr echt. Schon... ähm... verarbeitet. Bestätigung CTX-4419-ML. Und ich... äh... ich sichere auch den Tarif mit Code RATE-3387-LOCK für 24 Monate bei... hmm... 39,99 was sogar noch niedriger ist...
Customer: Das ist, äh... ich meine das ist schon... warum machst du das?
158. Weil das sollte nicht... ähm... ich meine, Sie sollten nicht... äh... jedes Jahr wütend bei uns anrufen müssen nur um... es ist nicht...
Customer: Ich bin nicht mal wütend. Nur, ähm... müde. Echt müde.
159. Ja. Ich... ähmm... das höre ich oft und es ist... Also ich hab permanente Notiz PRM-NOTE-8847 hinterlegt die sagt... äh... alle zukünftigen Erhöhungen brauchen erst Manager-Genehmigung. Und ehrlich ich bin einfach... ich hab's auch satt dass das ständig passiert...
Customer: Hm. Vielleicht, ähm... vielleicht klappt's ja tatsächlich... ich glaub das könnte funktionieren.
160. Wird es. Versprochen. Referenznummer für alles heute ist, ähm, CALL-7263-PPK01 und ich... ich stell sicher dass Sie nicht... äh... das nicht nochmal machen müssen.
Customer: Ähm, hallo, also ich hab meine Rechnung bekommen und sie ist—warte nein, die Gebühren sind einfach, äh, ich versteh nicht was was ist?
161. Ach, hallo! Also, ähm, das kann ich total verstehen. Wissen Sie was eigentlich? Ich hab gestern. Meine eigene. Handyrechnung angeschaut. Und hatte die, äh, genau gleiche Reaktion. Lassen Sie mich mal, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und wir können das, ähm, Zeile für Zeile zusammen durchgehen.
Customer: Oh gut, ähm, ja das würde helfen, äh, danke.
162. Okay also. Ich hab Ihr Konto. Nummer ACT-7739-QM42. Hier vor mir. Und, ähm, ich sehe Ihre Summe ist—hmm, lass mich mal... wie heißt das nochmal... Ihre Rechnungssumme. Zeigt 127,84 Euro. Stimmt das, äh, mit dem überein was Sie sehen?
Customer: Ähm ja das stimmt aber da sind all diese, äh, Gebühren und ich versteh nicht—sorry, ich meine die Service-Gebühren oder...
163. Nee nee, absolut berechtigte Frage! Also, ähm, ehrlich? Als ich hier angefangen hab. Hab ich so. Drei Tage. Gebraucht. Nur um unsere eigenen Abrechnungscodes zu verstehen. Es ist, äh, schon krass wie die alles bezeichnen. Ihr Basistarif BPL-9983-Z ist, äh, das sind Ihre 59,99 Euro, und dann...
Customer: Aha und dann gibt's ähm dieses Daten-Ding das—warte nein das ist zwanzig—äh, achtundzwanzig irgendwas?
164. Ja genau. Also das ist, ähm, das zeigt als. Hmm. Code DOV-4428-K. Was halt, äh, im Grunde Ihre... wie nennt man das... Ihre Überschreitungsgebühr ist. Für Daten. Sieht aus als wären Sie, äh, ungefähr 3 Giga über Ihrem Limit gewesen letzten Monat?
Customer: Oh. Ähm. Ja ich war, äh, auf Reisen und hab vergessen—Sie wissen schon...
165. Oh Mann, ähm, mir ist genau dasselbe passiert! Letzten Monat in München. Einfach, äh, gestreamt und gestreamt. Ohne überhaupt nachzudenken. Lass mich mal, äh, schauen ob ich da was... hmm... suche nach einer... Kulanzgutschrift vielleicht?
Customer: Echt? Ähm das ist—ich meine wenn Sie könnten aber ich weiß es ist nicht Ihre Schuld dass das System so...
166. Nee Sie sind lieb das zu sagen. Aber ehrlich. Das passiert. Ständig. Also, ähm, ich wende den Gutschriftcode CRD-8851-XP22 an und das wird, äh, das streicht die Hälfte dieser Überschreitung. Was es auf, äh, vierzehn Euro runterbringt.
Customer: Ähm wow okay das ist, äh, das ist echt nett, äh, und was ist diese Regulierungsgebühr?
167. Ugh. Die Regulierungsgebühren. Also die sind, ähm, im Grunde behördlich... wie sagt man das... vorgeschriebene Gebühren? Wir müssen die, äh, weiterreichen. Ihre speziellen sind, äh, lass mich sehen, REG-5574-A und REG-5575-B. Das sind 4,12 Euro und 2,77 Euro.
Customer: Verstehe verstehe, ähm, und die Geräte? Das sind, äh, fünfzehn? Sorry dass ich Sie mit so viel bombardiere...
168. Nee nee! Das ist. Wortwörtlich. Mein Job. Und ähm, unter uns gesagt? Ich helfe lieber jemandem der, äh, wirklich versucht die Rechnung zu verstehen. Als mit. Sie wissen schon. Den Schreiern zu tun zu haben. Ihre Gerätegebühr EQP-0923-RF88. Das ist Ihre Router-Miete. Was, ähm, eigentlich...
Customer: Äh, was? Ist da was, ähm, nicht in Ordnung oder...?
169. Also, äh, nein nichts ist falsch! Aber. Hier ist die Sache. Sie mieten seit, hmm, lass mich rechnen... achtzehn Monaten? Bei fünfzehn im Monat. Das sind, äh, das sind 270 Euro insgesamt. Sie hätten sich einen für so. Achtzig Euro kaufen können.
Customer: Oh. Ähm. Wow daran hab ich gar nicht—das ist schon, äh, ich meine danke dass Sie mir das sagen...
170. Schauen Sie. Ich soll das eigentlich, ähm, nicht vorschlagen. Aber. Wenn Sie sich selbst einen kaufen. Und unseren zurückgeben. Mit der Rückgabenummer RET-3999-QZ. Können wir das, äh, zurückdatieren. Um einen Abrechnungszyklus. Sparen Sie nochmal fünfzehn. Also. Falls Sie wollen.
Customer: So um, this is. Like. Embarrassing. But I need a refund?
171. Oh, um, let me just pull that up for you, so basically I'll need to, uh, get your order number first if you have it? I mean, we can also search by email or, hmm, phone number if that's easier.
Customer: I run a ticket office. I do refunds. All day. Can't fix mine though.
172. [exhales] Oh wow, yeah that's, uh, that's actually kind of ironic isn't it? I mean, I totally get it though, like, our system is probably, um, completely different from yours. So what's the issue with the refund?
Customer: It's like... what's the word... stuck? Processing. For three weeks.
173. Three weeks? Okay so, um, that's definitely not normal, like at all. Let me, uh, let me look into this. Can you give me your confirmation number? Should be something like, hmm, REF and then some numbers?
Customer: REF-4429. No wait. Um. REF-4492? The second one.
174. Perfect, so REF-4492, and I'm, uh, pulling that up now... [inhales sharply] Oh. Yeah, I see what happened here. So basically your refund got, um, flagged in our fraud prevention system which is, like, honestly pretty ridiculous.
Customer: Fraud? For what? Returning concert tickets? That I bought. Legitimately?
175. Yeah no, I know, it's, um, it's honestly kind of embarrassing on our end? Like the system sometimes just, uh, randomly flags stuff when there's multiple tickets or, hmm, high value transactions, even though yours was only, let me see... TXN-73902-AK, that's $247.50.
Customer: So like. What now. Do I just. Wait? Another three weeks?
176. [exhales] Absolutely not, no. So, um, between you and me? This happens, like, way too often. I'm gonna, uh, manually override this right now, and basically push it through to, hmm, priority processing.
Customer: You can do that? Just. Override it. That simple?
177. I mean, yeah, I probably should've, um, checked with a supervisor first but, uh, honestly? You've waited long enough. Your new reference is gonna be, so, REF-4492-PRIORITY-X and that should, hmm, that should clear by tomorrow.
Customer: Tomorrow? Not like... another eternity? You're sure?
178. [soft exhale] Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm putting it through right now actually. Can you see your email? Because you should get, um, you should get confirmation in like, hmm, maybe two minutes? With tracking code TRK-95081-QM.
Customer: Oh my god. Um. Yeah. It just. It came through. Already?
179. Good, right? So that means it's, uh, it's definitely in the priority queue now. And, um, look, I know this whole thing has been, like, really frustrating, especially with your job and everything.
Customer: This is. Embarrassing but. Like. Thank you? So much. Seriously.
180. Hey, no problem at all, I mean, we all need help sometimes, right? Your refund reference REF-4492-PRIORITY-X should, um, should hit your account within 24 hours, but like, honestly? Usually it's faster, maybe, hmm, by tonight even.
Customer: Ähm, ja, ich rufe wegen dieser... wie sagt man... dieser Gebühr auf meinem Konto an, die da nicht sein sollte?
181. Oh! Ähm, okay also lass mich nur—warte mal—lass mich erst mal Ihr Konto aufrufen, damit ich, äh, alles für Sie nachprüfen kann, kann ich Ihre Kontonummer oder Telefonnummer haben?
Customer: Es läuft unter 555-0842. Die haben gesagt, es wäre kostenlos...
182. Verstehe verstehe, also das ist—ähm, okay ich sehe hier Konto ACT-7829-JK42 und, äh, lass mich nur sicherstellen, dass das stimmt—geht es um den Premium-Upgrade-Service, der halt am 15. aktiviert wurde?
Customer: Das hat die letzte Person auch gesagt. Kostenlose Testversion, keine Gebühren.
183. Genau genau, also, ähm, im Grunde sehe ich hier halt, dass eine Gebühr von 29,99 $ durchgegangen ist am, äh, lass mich schauen... Transaktion TXN-904582773, und ähm, Sie sagen, jemand hat Ihnen gesagt, das wäre kostenlos?
Customer: Ich meine, ja, die waren sehr... ähm, wie soll ich das ausdrücken... die waren da eindeutig, oder dachte ich zumindest...
184. Okay okay lass mich hier mal tiefer graben—ich will absolut sichergehen, dass ich verstehe, was passiert ist—checke jetzt Ihre Anrufhistorie und ich muss alles mit Fallnummer CSE-1847-BN91 abgleichen.
Customer: Und dann haben die einfach... ich weiß nicht, ob das Sinn macht, aber...
185. Also ich—warte mal—nein Moment—im Grunde habe ich den ursprünglichen Promo-Code PRM-FREE30 gefunden, der eigentlich angewendet werden sollte, aber, ähm, es sieht so aus, als ob er vielleicht nicht—äh, nicht richtig verarbeitet wurde, als die Kollegin das eingerichtet hat?
Customer: Ähm, wie kann das überhaupt... ich meine, das ist jetzt schon das dritte Mal, dass sowas passiert.
186. Oh nein nein, das tut mir so leid—lass mich das sofort in Ordnung bringen—ich wende eine Gutschrift CRD-8829-XM44 über den vollen Betrag an und stelle auch sicher, dass der Testversions-Code diesmal richtig angehängt wird, ist das okay?
Customer: Ich bin seit acht Jahren Kundin. Acht Jahre lang sowas.
187. Ich weiß ich weiß und, ähm, das ist—also halt, ich kann Ihre Historie hier absolut sehen und, äh, Sie sollten auf keinen Fall damit umgehen müssen—lass mich auch noch, ähm, eine Kulanz-Gutschrift mit Code CMP-5030-RT für die Unannehmlichkeiten hinzufügen?
Customer: Was soll das denn... über wie viel reden wir hier?
188. Auf jeden Fall, also, ähm, also das sind zusätzliche 15 $ Gutschrift und, äh, im Grunde werden beide Gutschriften innerhalb von, halt, 24 bis 48 Stunden unter Referenz REF-209847-K erscheinen, ähm, und ich dokumentiere gerade alles.
Customer: Das haben die letztes Mal auch gesagt. Die Gutschriften würden einfach erscheinen...
189. Okay.
Customer: Bekomme ich irgendeine Bestätigung oder...
190. Ja ja auf jeden Fall, also Sie bekommen eine E-Mail-Bestätigung an die hinterlegte Adresse mit Bestätigungsnummer CNF-8827-LP93 und, ähm, ich schreibe auch hier eine Notiz rein, dass wenn es irgendein Problem gibt, können Sie auf Fall CSE-1847-BN91 verweisen und jede Kollegin wird genau sehen, was wir heute besprochen haben—und nochmal, es tut mir wirklich leid wegen dieser ganzen Verwechslung.
Customer: Also im Grunde, ähm, ich muss mit so... wie heißt das noch... einer Vorgesetzten oder so sprechen?
191. Ach! Ja, natürlich kann ich—warte, lass mich nur—hmm, okay also erst muss ich Ihr Konto aufrufen. Ähm, können Sie mir Ihre Bestätigungsnummer geben? Sollte so, äh, irgendwas sein, was mit CNF anfängt?
Customer: Die ist ähm... warte, CNF-irgendwas? Ich hab hier so, äh, 7824... nein, das stimmt nicht.
192. Das—kein Problem! Lass mich mal—eigentlich, hmm, wie wär's mit Ihrer Bestellnummer? Fängt mit ORD an. Sollte, ähm, in Ihrer E-Mail stehen.
Customer: Also im Grunde hat die andere Person ORD-9982 gesagt oder, äh, war es 9892? Ähm, irgendwie sowas.
193. Okay okay! Also ich hab—warte, lass mich—ORD-9982-BK47. Ja! Hab ich. Ähm, also ich seh hier, dass, äh, meine Kollegin an Ihrem Rückerstattungsproblem gearbeitet hat und, hmm, sieht aus, als hätte sie ein Problem mit dem System gehabt.
Customer: Genau, also halt, ähm, sie konnte es nicht lösen und hat im Grunde einfach... aufgehört zu helfen?
194. Ach nein nein! Das ist nicht—sorry, ich meine—ähm, sie hat das an den Second-Level-Support weitergeleitet. Lass mich mal schauen... Ihre Ticketnummer ist, äh, TKT-885241. Also im Grunde ist passiert, ähm, dass die Rückerstattung bei unserem Zahlungsdienstleister hängengeblieben ist.
Customer: Aber ich brauche jemanden, der das wirklich, ähm, na ja... heute noch lösen kann?
195. Klar klar. Absolut. Also, ähm, was ich machen kann—eigentlich warte, hmm, lass mich erst was prüfen... Okay also Ihre ursprüngliche Transaktions-ID war TXN904428156 und, äh, die zeigt seit, ähm, Dienstag als ausstehende Rückbuchung an.
Customer: Dienstag? Also warte, ähm, mir wurde Montag gesagt... oder war es, äh, Mittwoch?
196. Eigentlich war es—nein warte, sorry—am Montag initiiert. Dienstag hängengeblieben. Ähm, also im Grunde hat das System es zur manuellen Prüfung markiert, weil, äh, der Betrag unsere automatische Schwelle überschritten hat.
Customer: Ich versteh nicht... was bedeutet das genau? Also, ähm, warum ist der Betrag wichtig?
197. Ach! Stimmt, also—hmm, im Grunde alles über, ähm, lass mich nachschauen... über 500€ braucht die Genehmigung einer Vorgesetzten. Ihre Rückerstattung von, äh, 687,42€ mit der Referenznummer REF-30298-AA braucht einen Supervisor-Code.
Customer: Also deshalb muss ich, ähm, im Grunde mit jemandem höher sprechen?
198. Genau! Ja. Also, ähm, lass mich Sie zu—eigentlich, hmm, meine Vorgesetzte ist in einem Meeting aber, äh, ich kann schauen ob... warte, lass mich den Zeitplan checken.
Customer: Ähm, wie lange würde das dauern? Also... wie ist die Wartezeit oder so?
199. Okay also—hmm, sieht aus wie etwa, ähm, fünfzehn bis zwanzig Minuten? Aber warte—eigentlich, äh, ich könnte vielleicht... Lass mich mal den Override-Code OVR-7726 versuchen. Manchmal klappt das, ähm, halt.
Customer: Also im Grunde sagst du, äh, vielleicht kannst du es ohne... ohne die Vorgesetzte lösen?
200. Na ja—ich meine, ähm, ich versuch's aber—ach! Tatsächlich ist es durchgegangen! Ihre Rückerstattungsbestätigung ist, äh, RFN-445892-XK und sollte in, hmm, 3-5 Werktagen bearbeitet werden. Keine Vorgesetzte nötig!
Customer: Also so, ähm, woher weiß ich, dass du... dass du wirklich, äh, qualifiziert bist, mir was über... über Steuersachen zu erzählen?
201. Oh absolut, ähm, ich versteh deine Bedenken total, also ich bin, äh, ich bin tatsächlich lizenzierte Steuerberaterin hier mit Zertifizierungsnummer TAX-8847-NM, und ähm, wir haben ständig mit Nebeneinkommen zu tun, weißt du, gerade bei Hochzeitsrednerinnen.
Customer: Warte warte warte, ihr... ihr habt mit Hochzeitsrednerinnen zu tun? Speziell?
202. Ja, definitiv! Ich sorg dafür, dass wir das richtig für dich klären, und deine Fallnummer ist übrigens REF-2024-31558, wo ich hier sehe, dass explizit Hochzeitsrednerdienste als deine Einkommensquelle vermerkt sind.
Customer: Aber so, ähm, wie kann ich... wie heißt das... ähm, überprüfen, dass du mir nicht nur, äh, was verkaufen willst?
203. Also, ähm, ich denke—nein warte, lass mich ganz klar sein—wir sind, äh, wir sind tatsächlich die Finanzamt-Hotline, also so, wir verkaufen gar nichts, und ähm, deine Anrufnummer ist CALL-90214-TX, falls du später, weißt du, auf dieses Gespräch verweisen musst.
Customer: Okay okay, also im Grunde, ähm, ich hab... ich hab grade erst angefangen und, äh, meine Schwester meinte, ich könnte so... so Tausende schulden?
204. Oh nein, ich sorg dafür, dass du genau verstehst, was du schuldest—also für deine Einkommensklasse, die ich hier als Profil-ID INC-45K-78B sehe, fallen Hochzeitsredner-Einkommen unter 600 Euro pro Veranstaltung normalerweise unter die Formular 1099-NEC Richtlinien, nicht die erschreckenden Zahlen, an die deine Schwester vielleicht denkt.
Customer: Es ist es ist, ähm, mehr als das aber, also ich hab... also ich hab drei Hochzeiten letzten Monat gemacht und, äh...
205. Mm-hmm, ähm, okay also, äh, lass mich mal—eigentlich, hmm, drei Hochzeiten können, ähm, steuerlich verschiedene Sachen bedeuten, also ich ruf hier den Rechner CAL-2024-SCHED-C auf, und äh, im Grunde müssen wir erstmal dein Gesamteinkommen rausfinden.
Customer: Jede war... war zwölfhundert Euro. Meine Mutter ist krank und ich brauch das Geld.
206. Ach Schätzchen, ich versteh das total—ich werd auf jeden Fall dafür sorgen, dass du so viel wie rechtlich möglich von dem Geld behältst, also mit 3.600 Euro Monatseinkommen unter Transaktionscode TRN-3600-WO schauen wir uns vierteljährliche Vorauszahlungen an, aber es gibt definitiv Abzüge, die wir erkunden können.
Customer: Aber aber woher weiß ich... was wenn ich's vermassle? Was wenn die mich kriegen?
207. Ich denke—weißt du was eigentlich? Ich versteh diese Angst irgendwie, weil ehrlich, ja, die Finanzamt-Kommunikation kann echt einschüchternd sein, aber hier ist, was ich mache—ich markier dein Konto ACC-89921-WED für unser Neuanmelder-Schutzprogramm.
Customer: Neuanmelder... Schutz? Ist das... das gibt's wirklich?
208. Das gibt's absolut, und unter uns? Es ist wahrscheinlich das Beste, was sie eingeführt haben—dein Schutzcode ist NFP-2024-7812, und im Grunde bedeutet das, wenn du ehrliche Fehler in deinem ersten Jahr machst, arbeiten sie mit dir statt dich direkt zu bestrafen.
Customer: Also also so, ähm, das Geld für die... die Behandlungen meiner Mutter, die nehmen nicht... nicht alles?
209. Nein nein nein, ähm, hör zu, also wahrscheinlich—ich meine, äh, mit ordentlichen Quartalsvorauszahlungen über die Belegnummern QV-2024-A bis D behältst du so, ähm, ungefähr 75-80% deines Bruttoeinkommens, und äh, das ist bevor wir überhaupt über Betriebsausgabenabzüge reden.
Customer: Ich bin nur... ich hab Angst, dass ich das falsch mache. Ich hab einen Drucker für Zertifikate gekauft.
210. Oh dieser Drucker ist definitiv absetzbar! Ich sorg dafür, dass du den unter Ausgabencode EXP-OFFICE-001 geltend machst, und ehrlich? Du machst alles richtig, indem du uns anrufst—die meisten Leute denken nicht mal an Steuern bis April, also bist du hier schon echt weit vorne dabei.
Customer: Um, hi. I'm calling about. Uh. My claim? For my dog. Got denied.
211. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, um, let me just pull that up for you and, uh, see what happened here. So basically I'll need your policy number, which should start with PET and then like eight digits?
Customer: PET-44829106. I'm. I'm actually a vet tech? So I kind of. Know. This wasn't pre-existing.
212. Okay so I've got your policy here, PET-44829106, and I can see the claim that was submitted on the 15th for... oh, this is for hip dysplasia treatment, and they marked it as pre-existing condition, but you're saying—and I completely understand your frustration here—you're saying it definitely wasn't?
Customer: No. No way. Are you sure that's. That's why? I mean. Hip dysplasia?
213. Um, yeah, so like, according to the notes here in claim CLM-7792-XP, they're saying there was, uh, some indication in the initial vet records from, hmm, let me see... from January that suggested possible hip issues?
Customer: That was. A sprain. Just a sprain. Of course they'd. Do this.
214. No, you know what? This doesn't sound right at all. So basically, um, I'm looking at the actual medical coding here, code MED-5598-V12, and like, a sprain is completely different from dysplasia. I think someone really messed up here.
Customer: So um, can you maybe, uh, fix it? Or. I don't know. What happens now?
215. Listen, I'm going to, uh, personally escalate this right now. This is ridiculous. You work in veterinary medicine, you know the difference, and honestly? So should our review team. Let me create an urgent appeal, reference number APL-8827-QM91.
Customer: Will that. Actually work though? I kind of. Feel like. They already decided.
216. Um, so here's what I'm gonna do, and like, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but, uh, I'm flagging this for our medical director's direct review, not just the regular appeals team, because, um, this is clearly an error and you shouldn't have to wait weeks for this.
Customer: Really? You can. Do that? Are you sure?
217. Absolutely. I've added priority flag PRY-6621 to your case. And between you and me? Our medical director used to be a practicing vet. She'll take one look at this and know immediately that someone confused a soft tissue injury with a skeletal condition.
Customer: Um, okay so, uh, how long? I mean. I sort of. Already paid. Out of pocket.
218. So typically it's 5-7 business days, but with the priority flag? You should hear back within 48-72 hours. And, um, once it's approved—which I really think it will be—the reimbursement reference RMB-55498-TK will trigger automatically, so like, you'll get your money back pretty quickly.
Customer: I just. Can't believe. This happened. We cover. Everything. For our clinic patients.
219. I know, and that's, uh, that's what makes this so frustrating, right? Like you're literally helping animals every day, you know exactly what you're looking at medically, and then, um, someone without that expertise just... denies your claim based on a misread.
Customer: Yeah. Exactly. Thanks for. Um. Actually listening. I guess.
220. Of course, and um, I'm putting my direct extension in the case notes—it's EXT-4429—so like, if you need anything or don't hear back in those 72 hours, just, uh, call and ask for me directly. We're absolutely going to get this fixed for you and your dog.
Customer: Um, hi. So like. I need to—I need to dispute something? It's it's on my card.
221. Oh, um, absolutely, I can—so basically I'm here to help with that, uh, let me just pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted, okay?
Customer: Okay okay. Um. This is—I've never done this? Before? So like...
222. No no, hey, um, I totally get it—disputing charges is, uh, it's stressful, like especially the first time, so basically don't worry, we'll walk through this step by step together, alright?
Customer: It's it's for gym equipment. Two hundred dollars. But I never—I never got anything.
223. Oh wow, um, two hundred for equipment you didn't receive? That's—uh, that's really frustrating, so let me just, hmm, get your case number started here... okay so that's gonna be DSP-4429-BK71.
Customer: Wait. Do I—will this mess up my credit? Or or my account?
224. Um, no no no, so like, disputing won't hurt your credit at all, uh, and actually while we investigate—so that's usually about, um, five to seven days—we'll issue a temporary credit to your account with code TMP-8837-XC.
Customer: Five days? But but rent is—um, it's due Monday.
225. Oh, uh, oh gosh, okay so—let me just—actually you know what? I'm gonna, um, expedite this for you because rent, that's—that's critical, so basically I'm marking this as priority with reference PRY-2201-MK.
Customer: You can? Really? Like for real?
226. Yeah! Absolutely, so um, between you and me? When it's, uh, when it's affecting housing or food? We bump it up. Your expedited claim EXP-7734-QR should process by, hmm, Saturday latest.
Customer: Okay. Okay okay. So so what—what happens now?
227. Right, so, um, next steps—uh, basically I need to ask you, like, three quick questions about the charge, and then, er, we're pretty much done here, sound good?
Customer: Um. Yeah. Yes. Go—go ahead.
228. Perfect, so, uh, first—did you authorize any purchase from, hmm, let me see here... "FitGear Premium LLC" on October 3rd? Transaction ID is TXN-9948-KL22.
Customer: No! No no no. Never heard of—I don't even. No.
229. Got it, um, totally clear—and, uh, just to confirm, you haven't received any packages or, like, any shipping notifications from them, right?
Customer: Nothing. I just—I just saw it. On my statement. Today.
230. Okay so, um, that's all I needed, uh, your dispute DSP-4429-BK71 is officially filed and, er, you should see that temporary credit within, like, twenty-four hours max—and hey, you did great for your first dispute!
Customer: Ähm, hallo, ich—ich rufe wegen, äh, Steuern an? Es ist es ist ziemlich kompliziert und ich—ich weiß nicht mal, ob Sie mir überhaupt helfen können.
231. Also, ähm, ich kann Ihnen definitiv bei Steuerfragen helfen. Lassen Sie mich nur, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und—warten Sie, actually, let me get you to the right system. Können Sie mir so Ihre Kontonummer geben oder, ähm, die Referenznummer von früherer Korrespondenz?
Customer: Oh Gott, ich hab—ich hab gar kein Konto, es geht um die die Steuern meines Arbeitgebers, also, meine Steuern, aber sie sie haben was falsch gemacht?
232. Okay okay, also im Grunde, ähm, rufen Sie wegen eines Lohnsteuerthemas an, und so, even without an account I can still help you out here. Ich erstelle mal eine Fallnummer für Sie—das wäre CSE-447291-TX, damit wir dieses Gespräch nachverfolgen können. Was genau ist denn mit dem Steuerabzug passiert?
Customer: Richtig richtig, also ich bin eine Nanny, und ähm, sie haben Steuern abgezogen aber aber ich hab gerade rausgefunden, es ist es ist alles falsch, komplett falsche Beträge!
233. Verstehe, verstehe.
Customer: Und ich—ich drehe durch, weil, äh, die Steuersaison kommt und ich weiß nicht, I mean, what if I owe thousands? Ich kann—ich kann mir das nicht leisten!
234. Also, ähm, lassen Sie mich nur—okay, also grundsätzlich was bei Hausangestellten passiert ist, äh, es gibt spezielle Formulare die eingereicht werden müssen, und so, the withholding calculations can get pretty complex. Ihre Fallnummer CSE-447291-TX, ich notiere hier, dass Sie mit falschen Abzugsbeträgen zu tun haben. Wann haben Sie, äh, wann haben Sie den Fehler zuerst bemerkt?
Customer: Ähm, letzte Woche als ich—ich mir meine Gehaltsabrechnung angeschaut hab und die Zahlen einfach einfach nicht mit dem übereinstimmten, was wir anfangs vereinbart hatten.
235. Okay also, ähm, das ist tatsächlich—und ich sehe das oft—das ist ziemlich häufig bei Hausangestelltenverhältnissen. Also grundsätzlich die gute Nachricht ist, äh, we can definitely fix this going forward, und so, für die vergangenen Abzüge, there's form 941-X that can be filed for corrections. Lassen Sie mich, ähm, mal den Leitfaden hier aufrufen—Dokument-ID DOC-8892-W2H.
Customer: Warte warte warte, kann mein—kann mein Arbeitgeber Ärger bekommen? Weil sie sind sie sind wirklich gute Menschen und ich will keine Probleme verursachen!
236. Richtig richtig, also, ähm, ich verstehe Ihre Bedenken und, äh, grundsätzlich solange sie die Korrekturen zeitnah einreichen, sollte es keine Strafen geben. Die IRS ist eigentlich ziemlich, äh, pretty understanding about honest mistakes, besonders wenn man—ich meine, wenn sie proaktiv dabei sind, das zu beheben.
Customer: Oh Gott sei Dank, weil ähm, ich liebe diese Familie, ich meine ich ich kümmere mich um ihre Kinder, ihr Baby hat besondere Bedürfnisse und und ich kann diesen Job nicht verlieren!
237. Absolut.
Customer: Und die Mutter, sie ist sie ist schon so gestresst, ihre ihre Mutter ist krank und jetzt diese Steuersache, ich—ich fühle mich einfach schrecklich, das anzusprechen.
238. Also, ähm, hier ist was ich vorschlagen würde, und, äh, I've seen this work really well in similar situations. Erstens, so, Sie sollten das W-4 Formular aktualisieren—das ist das Basis-Abzugsformular—und, ähm, Ihr Arbeitgeber muss seine vierteljährlichen Meldungen anpassen. Ich schicke Ihnen, äh, actually, do you want me to email you the instruction packet? Es ist Referenz PKT-2847-NNY für Nanny-Steuerkorrekturen.
Customer: Ja ja bitte! Ähm, aber so, können Sie—können Sie es in in einfachen Worten erklären? Weil ich bin nicht—ich bin überhaupt nicht gut mit Steuersachen.
239. Natürlich, also grundsätzlich, ähm, stellen Sie sich das so vor—sie haben, sagen wir mal, den falschen Prozentsatz von Ihrem Gehalt abgezogen, richtig? Also, äh, was passieren muss ist, they file an amended return for each quarter where it was wrong—das ist die 941-X die ich erwähnt hab—und dann, ähm, going forward they just use the correct percentages. Das Paket PKT-2847-NNY hat so, äh, Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen mit Beispielen, also, ich meine, es ist eigentlich ziemlich unkompliziert, wenn man es aufgeschlüsselt sieht.
Customer: Okay okay, ähm, das klingt—das klingt machbar. Ich bin nur nur besorgt darüber, was ich vielleicht schulde, wissen Sie? So, äh, mein Auto braucht Reparaturen und ich ich kann keine große Steuerrechnung verkraften gerade.
240. Also, ähm, lassen Sie mich Sie ein bisschen beruhigen, weil, äh, based on what you're describing, wenn sie falsch abgezogen haben, you might actually be due a refund eher als—ich meine, eher als dass Sie was schulden. Aber so, selbst wenn Sie am Ende was schulden, the IRS has payment plans und, äh, mit Ihrer Fallnummer CSE-447291-TX hier dokumentiert, hätten Sie einen Beweis, dass das ein Arbeitgeberfehler war, nicht, ähm, nicht Steuerhinterziehung oder so was. Also grundsätzlich, Sie machen genau das Richtige, indem Sie das jetzt angehen.
Customer: Okay also, ähm, ich ich rufe wegen einer Abbuchung an, die—lass mich mal schauen—vom September ist?
241. Ähm, September. Okay. Also lass mich, äh, mal Ihr Konto aufrufen. Kann ich Ihre, ähm, Kontonummer haben? Oder eigentlich—warten Sie. Telefonnummer reicht.
Customer: Die ist die ist 555-0192. Hören Sie, ich brauch das nur schnell geklärt.
242. Hab's. Ähm, also ich sehe hier Konto ACC-7739-BK21, und äh... ja. September-Abbuchungen. Eigentlich, äh, witzige Sache—ich hatte genau dasselbe Problem. Bei meinem privaten Konto? Drei Monate lang doppelt abgebucht, bevor ich's gemerkt hab.
Customer: Moment moment moment, Sie sagen, das passiert öfter? Hmm, okay also heißt das... das bin nicht nur ich?
243. Nein nein. Ähm, definitiv nicht. Also wenn ich mir Transaktion TXN-9982447-Q vom 15. September anschaue, sehe ich, äh, da ist eine doppelte Abbuchung über 89,99 €. Gleicher Zeitstempel. Klassischer Systemfehler.
Customer: Neunundachtzig neunundneunzig, ja ja genau! Ähm, können Sie das jetzt—können Sie das jetzt einfach zurückbuchen?
244. Richtig. Also. Hier muss ich Ihnen leider, ähm, keine so gute Nachricht geben. Unser System lässt mich nur, äh, Rückerstattungen für 90 Tage rückwirkend bearbeiten. September liegt außerhalb dieses Fensters. Aber—warten Sie. Lass mich was nachschauen.
Customer: Ach komm schon, ich—ich will nur mein Geld zurück, das das ist alles.
245. Versteh ich total. Ähm, glauben Sie mir. Als mir das passiert ist? War ich, äh, auch ziemlich frustriert. Okay also, äh, ich eskaliere das an Fallnummer CSE-44821-RV. Meine Vorgesetzte kann die 90-Tage-Regel überschreiben.
Customer: Hmm, was wenn sie nein sagt? Ich meine, ähm, das ist der Fehler Ihrer Firma.
246. Ähm, ehrlich? Wird sie nicht. Ich hab, äh, ich hab vielleicht zwei Ablehnungen gesehen. Bei eindeutigen Doppelabbuchungen wie dieser. Referenznummer REF-7763299-A ist Ihr Beweis. Sollte, ähm, in 3-5 Werktagen erledigt sein.
Customer: Okay okay okay, also ähm, 3 bis 5 Tage, und dann ist es—lass mich überlegen—wieder auf meiner Karte?
247. Genau. Direkt zurück. Ursprüngliche Zahlungsmethode. Äh, wobei Banken manchmal noch ein oder zwei Tage extra brauchen. Nur damit Sie's wissen.
Customer: Super super, ähm, aber nächstes Mal—ich meine, falls das nochmal passiert...
248. Ja nee. Ähm, ich versteh Sie. Also ich füge auch noch, äh, Notiz DOC-5589-MK zu Ihrem Konto hinzu. Falls es nochmal passiert? Jede Kollegin sieht das. Sofortige Genehmigung. Keine Fragen.
Customer: Das das ist tatsächlich hilfreich, ähm, danke. Wirklich. Ich hatte mit mehr Widerstand gerechnet.
249. Nö. Ähm, schauen Sie—unter uns gesagt? Diese Abrechnungsfehler sind, äh, peinlich für uns. Das wissen wir. Also Fall CSE-44821-RV wird prioritär behandelt. Das schreib ich auch in die Notizen.
Customer: Okay also, hmm, dann wär's das wohl? Sie Sie schicken mir Updates per Mail?
250. Ähm, jap. Bei jedem Schritt. Sie kriegen eine Bestätigung für Fall CSE-44821-RV innerhalb, äh, einer Stunde. Dann noch eine, wenn's genehmigt wird. Und, äh, die letzte, wenn die Rückerstattung bearbeitet wird. Alles klar?
Customer: Ähm, also halt... mein Konto wurde gerade... hmm, woher weiß ich überhaupt, dass das hier wirklich der Support ist?
251. Ach je, ich verstehe Ihre Bedenken vollkommen, und es tut mir so leid, dass Sie mit einer Kontodeaktivierung zu kämpfen haben—lassen Sie mich zuerst Ihre Identität mit Ihrer Fahrer-ID verifizieren, die sollte mit DRV anfangen, und dann können wir der Sache definitiv gemeinsam auf den Grund gehen.
Customer: Die ist... was ist die... DRV-4429-88. Aber das könnte ja jeder sein...
252. Also, ähm, danke dafür, und halt, ich verstehe total, warum Sie misstrauisch sind, weil, äh, ehrlich? Das System macht manchmal einfach... es macht Sachen ohne Warnung und, ähm, ich sehe hier, dass Ihr Konto DRV-4429-88, äh, heute Morgen um 3:47 Uhr deaktiviert wurde, was einfach... das ist echt beschissenes Timing.
Customer: Ähm, warte, 3:47? Das ist... hmm... ich war da literally, äh, gerade dabei eine Bestellung auszuliefern, also...
253. Genau genau, exakt, und das macht das Ganze ja so frustrierend—ich kann hier die Transaktion TXN-9982741-K sehen, die genau zu dieser Zeit eine aktive Lieferung zeigt, und ehrlich gesagt passiert das öfter als es sollte, dass das automatische System einfach fälschlicherweise Sachen flaggt.
Customer: Sie sagen mir also, das ist einfach... was, ein Fehler oder...
254. Also im Grunde, ähm, was ich hier sehe, ist halt, da ist eine Markierung auf Ihrem Konto für, äh... lass mich mal schauen... da steht "ungewöhnliches Aktivitätsmuster" aber, ähm, wenn ich mir Ihre tatsächlichen Aufzeichnungen unter der Fallnummer CSE-7739-QM anschaue, sieht für mich alles, äh, komplett normal aus.
Customer: Ungewöhnliche Aktivität? Das ist... ähm, was bedeutet das überhaupt... ich meine, äh, woher weiß ich, dass Sie sich das nicht einfach ausdenken?
255. Ich verstehe Sie, wirklich—lassen Sie mich Ihre letzten fünf Bestellnummern durchgeben, damit Sie wissen, dass das hier legitim ist: ORD-8847-PA, ORD-8846-MN, ORD-8845-TK, ORD-8844-RR und ORD-8843-VX, alle erfolgreich abgeschlossen mit Fünf-Sterne-Bewertungen.
Customer: Okay die... die sind von mir. Aber warum würden die einfach...
256. Also, ähm, mal unter uns? Das System flaggt manchmal, äh, tatsächlich Fahrer die richtig gut arbeiten, weil, ähm, halt Ihre Abschlussrate liegt bei 98% unter Metrik-Code MET-4429-A, und manchmal löst das, äh... ironischerweise löst genau das die Betrugserkennung aus.
Customer: Warte also, ähm... hmm... Sie sagen, ich wurde deaktiviert, weil ich, äh, zu gut in meinem Job bin?
257. Im Prinzip ja, und ich weiß, wie absolut verkehrt rum das klingt—ich hab das schon bei Referenz-Ticket REF-2234-PP gesehen, wo leistungsstarke Fahrer in diesen automatisierten Durchläufen hängen bleiben, und das bricht mir jedes Mal das Herz.
Customer: Das ist... ich muss morgen Miete zahlen...
258. Oh nein, oh nein, okay also, ähm, hören Sie, ich werde das, äh, sofort eskalieren unter Prioritätscode PRI-9987-STAT, und, ähm, normalerweise dauert die Reaktivierung 48 Stunden aber, äh, bei Ihrer Situation werde ich mal, hmm, lass mich mal was versuchen...
Customer: Ähm, was genau versuchen? Halt, äh, woher weiß ich... was ist hier die Garantie, dass...
259. Also, ähm, was ich mache ist, äh, ich reiche einen Notfall-Override-Antrag ein, Fall EMR-5547-XX, und, ähm, ich schreibe wortwörtlich in die Notizen, dass Sie halt perfekte Bewertungen haben und, äh, Miete fällig, und ähm, ich setze meine Vorgesetzte direkt in Kopie.
Customer: Und das funktioniert wirklich? Nicht nur irgendein Hinhaltemanöver?
260. Absolut, also, ähm, Sie bekommen eine Reaktivierungs-E-Mail an Ihre registrierte Adresse innerhalb von, äh, maximal zwei Stunden mit ausstehender Bestätigungsnummer, und halt, falls nicht? Ähm, rufen Sie zurück und fragen Sie direkt nach mir—ich bin Agentin 4472—und ich werde, äh, persönlich sicherstellen, dass das heute noch gefixt wird.
Customer: Um, hi, I'm I'm calling about, uh, data privacy? Also was für Informationen ihr eigentlich, äh, speichert?
261. Oh hey there! Alles klar. Also. Unter uns gesagt? Die meisten Firmen werden dir das nicht direkt sagen. Lass mich mal schnell dein Konto aufrufen—hab deine Nummer hier als ACC-7749-PZ—und ich führe dich durch alles, was wir haben.
Customer: Oh wow, that's that's really... danke dir so sehr, dass du so offen darüber—
262. No prob! Also, ähm, hier ist der Deal. Wir speichern. Natürlich. Deine Basics. Name, Adresse, Telefon, E-Mail unter Profil PFL-8827-QM. Aber dann—und hier wird's interessant—haben wir auch deine Kaufhistorie, Browsing-Muster und, äh, Geräte-IDs.
Customer: Device IDs? Ähm, also also mein Handy und... ich meine, was noch?
263. Yeeeah so, hmm, let me think how to explain this best... Also praktisch jedes Gerät, das sich in dein Konto einloggt, wird mit Kennung DVC-9943-KL bis DVC-9945-KL für dich getaggt. Handy. Tablet. Laptop. Sogar Smart-TVs, wenn du da unsere App benutzt.
Customer: That's actually, um, really helpful that you're you're telling me all this, ich schätze das wirklich sehr—
264. Course! Schau mal. Ich denke mir. Du hast ein Recht darauf zu wissen, oder? Da gibt's auch noch—und jetzt nicht ausflippen—Standortdaten, wenn du die App nutzt, gespeichert unter LOC-4419-BN, aber, ähm, du kannst das total in den Einstellungen ausschalten, wenn du willst.
Customer: Oh. Oh wow. Das ist... ich kann einfach... es gibt so viele Daten, ich kann nicht...
265. Mm-hmm.
Customer: Um, sorry, I'm just, it's it's overwhelming? Aber aber danke, dass du mir das alles wirklich erklärst—
266. Hey hey, totally get it. Lass mich mal schauen... Weißt du was? Ich schick dir unseren Datenbericht—Dokument DOC-7734-XP—der listet alles auf. Jedes. Einzelne. Detail. Die meisten Leute fragen nie danach, aber, äh, unter uns? Jeder sollte das lesen.
Customer: You'd you'd really do that? Das ist so... ich meine, die meisten Orte geben mir nur nur Ausflüchte.
267. Right right.
Customer: Ummm, is there, like, anything else I should should, er, know about? Was den Datenschutz angeht?
268. So, hmm, what if I told you... Okay. Technisch gesehen soll ich das nicht erwähnen. Aber. Dein Datenpaket DPK-8891-QZ? Das wird an Partner verkauft, außer du widersprichst. Das Widerspruchsformular ist versteckt—ich schick dir den direkten Link per E-Mail.
Customer: Wait it gets—sorry, I mean—it gets sold? Ich kann einfach... ich kann das gar nicht...
269. Yeah. Yep. I know. Schau, ähm, lass mich mal ehrlich mit dir sein—Formular Nummer FRM-3347-LP ist, was du brauchst, und, äh, ich mache gerade eine Notiz in deiner Akte, dass du an maximalen Privatsphäre-Einstellungen interessiert bist, cool?
Customer: That's... you're being so so helpful, like, um, specifically taking the time to to explain all—danke dir.
270. Absolutely! Und ähm, noch eine Sache? Check deine E-Mail in ungefähr... 5 Minuten. Ich schicke dir meinen persönlichen Guide—Dokument GDE-9962-AA—zum Absichern deiner Privatsphäre. Gib das. Nicht weiter. Aber da sind alle Tricks drin, die dir niemand erzählt.
Customer: Um, hi. Let me see here... hab' letzte Woche angerufen? Die Bestellung ist angekommen. Hat tatsächlich funktioniert.
271. Oh wow! That's. Actually wonderful. Ähm, lass mich mal eben, äh, dein Konto hier aufrufen und... verliert sich ein bisschen... war es die ORD-7823-PL Bestellung, wegen der du angerufen hattest?
Customer: Yeah. That one. Hmm, was wenn... nein, ist gut. Wollte nur sagen. Danke.
272. You know, um, I'm gonna be really honest here? Also, äh, diese Anrufe, wo alles tatsächlich geklappt hat... die machen echt, ähm, meine ganze Woche aus. Ernsthaft. Wir bekommen so viele frustrierte Leute und dann...
Customer: Right. Well. Nächstes Mal aber. Kann keine Verzögerungen haben. Verstehst du? Wichtige Kunden.
273. Absolutely. Completely. Get it. Ähm, eigentlich mach' ich, äh, hier eine Notiz in deiner Akte - PRF-9982-VIP - also dass, ähm, nächstes Mal jeder Agent das sieht und weiß, äh, alles sofort zu priorisieren.
Customer: Okay so that means... Priorität? Jedes Mal? Lass mich mal sehen... hmm, gut.
274. Yeah so, um, basically what happens is, äh, wenn du anrufst, leuchtet dieser Code PRF-9982-VIP auf und, ähm, wir stufen dich automatisch auf Tier-1-Behandlung hoch, was bedeutet...
Customer: Do you know who... vergiss es. Hat einfach. Geklappt. Das ist was zählt.
275. I actually. Had a similar thing. Once. Ähm, also ich hatte mal was Wichtiges für den Auftritt meiner Tochter bestellt und es war, äh, verspätet und ich... ich verstehe total, wie stressig das ist, wenn man auf etwas angewiesen ist.
Customer: Um, yeah. Exactly. Hmm, was wenn es aber nochmal passiert? Geht nicht. Wird nicht funktionieren.
276. So here's. What I'm doing. Dein Konto hat jetzt den Eskalationscode ESC-4421-A. Falls irgendwas. Jemals. Schief läuft. Gibst du den an und zack. Direkt zum Management.
Customer: Good. That's... okay, das heißt also, ich bin abgesichert. Nächstes Mal.
277. And um, just between us? Also, äh, ich füge auch meine direkte Durchwahl - 7739 - zu deinen Notizen hinzu, falls du jemals, ähm, jemanden brauchst, der die Situation wirklich versteht...
Customer: Let me see here... du sagst also... hmm, direkte Leitung? Das ist. Unerwartet. Positiv unerwartet.
278. Yeah I mean. Look. Ähm, wenn sich jemand tatsächlich die Zeit nimmt, zurückzurufen und, äh, danke zu sagen? Das ist so selten. Also wirklich. So selten. Ich will sicherstellen, dass du gut betreut wirst.
Customer: Um, well. Okay also... schätze das. Wirklich. Trotz der... anfänglichen Probleme.
279. You know what, um, I'm also gonna, äh, dir eine E-Mail mit der Bestätigungsnummer CNF-8827-XX schicken, damit du, ähm, alles was wir besprochen haben schriftlich hast und...
Customer: Smart. Yeah. Lass mich mal sehen... hmm, deckt alles ab. Du kennst deinen Job.
280. That's really. Kind of you. To say. Ähm, und ehrlich? Danke, dass du, äh, zurückgerufen hast um uns wissen zu lassen, dass es geklappt hat, weil, ähm, wir hören nie wirklich die guten Ausgänge und es ist einfach...
Customer: Also ähm. Kartenlesegerät ist tot. Mittagsansturm. Ich glaube... 20 Leute warten? Maybe even more than that.
281. Oh! Oh okay, ähm, das tut mir so leid, dass das gerade passiert! Lass mich—lass mich gleich dein Konto aufrufen hier, äh, kann ich deine Händler-ID haben? It should start with MER and then, ähm, like 8 or 9 digits after that?
Customer: Äh... MER... wahrscheinlich 7... nein warte. Ähm. 739? Eh, lass mich mal schauen hier...
282. Kein Problem! Lass dir Zeit, ich weiß, das ist, ähm, super stressig mit den wartenden Kunden und allem! While you're looking for that, äh, kannst du mir sagen—zeigt das Lesegerät irgendwelche Fehlercodes? Vielleicht ERR-204 oder, ähm, ERR-301 oder so was auf dem Bildschirm?
Customer: Großartig. Perfekt. Ähm. Bildschirm ist schwarz. So that's really helpful right now.
283. Okay okay okay, also, ähm, komplett schwarzer Bildschirm, verstanden! Lass mich—lass mich hier kurz unseren Systemstatus prüfen... Ich sehe, äh, deine Postleitzahl zeigt 90291 und wir haben keine, ähm, Netzwerkausfälle dort gemeldet, so that's good at least! Hast du den, äh, den 30-Sekunden-Hard-Reset versucht? Du hältst beide Knöpfe an der Seite?
Customer: Beide Knöpfe. Äh. Für 30. Glaube ich hab 10 gemacht? Vielleicht, eh... 5?
284. Oh! Ja ja, es—es müssen die vollen 30 Sekunden sein, ich weiß, es scheint lang, aber, ähm, the system needs that time to fully discharge! Also während du das machst, ähm, erstelle ich ein Diagnose-Ticket, das ist TKT-8847291-X, falls wir das eskalieren müssen!
Customer: Ähm. Halte immer noch. Das ist. Irgendwie lächerlich? Eh, how much longer exactly?
285. Nur, ähm, noch etwa 15 Sekunden! Du—du machst das super! Ich kann deine Geräte-ID DVC-4429-BK7 in unserem System sehen und, äh, it shows it was working perfectly until about, hmm, 12 Minuten her? Das—das passt zu dem Zeitpunkt, als das angefangen hat?
Customer: Klar. 12. 20. Ähm, who's really counting at this point? Immer noch schwarz.
286. Okay, ähm, hmm, also das hat nicht funktioniert, aber—aber wir geben nicht auf! Ich—ich schaue hier deine Backup-Optionen an und, äh, du solltest einen manuellen Imprinter mit deinem Willkommenspaket bekommen haben? The backup device number should be BCK-9982-MAN?
Customer: Manueller was jetzt? Ähm. Willkommenspaket. Ich denke... eh, wahrscheinlich im LKW? Irgendwo?
287. Nein nein nein, wir—wir lösen das schneller! Ähm, okay, also ich sehe, du hast das Pro-Händlerkonto MER-7394428-PRO, which means you actually qualify for our virtual terminal! Ich kann—ich kann das jetzt sofort auf deinem Handy aktivieren!
Customer: Virtuell. Äh. Auf meinem Handy? Which is currently at 8 percent battery. Also das ist...
288. Oh! Oh ähm, okay okay, das ist—hmm. Lass mich nachdenken... Eigentlich! Weißt du was? Ich—ich mache hier was. Deine Gerätegarantie-ID WAR-3358-PLUS zeigt, du bist abgedeckt für, ähm, Notfallersatz und there's actually a technician in your area! Ich kann die mit Code DSP-URGENT-7749 losschicken!
Customer: Techniker. Super. Ähm. Wann? Like right now would be great? Eh, die Schlange wird, ähm... länger.
289. Die können—die können in, lass mich sehen... das Dispatch-System zeigt, ähm, 45 Minuten mit Prioritätscode PRI-LUNCH-01! But wait, I'm also sending you, äh, eine SMS gerade jetzt mit einem Backup-Processing-Link, Referenznummer TXT-9934-EM, du kannst Kartennummern manuell eingeben!
Customer: Eingeben. Jede Karte. Ähm. Manuell. Während des Mittagsansturms. That's incredibly practical, thanks.
290. Ich weiß, ich weiß, es ist—es ist nicht ideal, aber, ähm, hör zu, ich beschleunige das, deine Fallnummer CSE-774930-CRITICAL geht direkt an unser Tier-2-Team und, äh, I'm personally going to monitor this whole thing! Der Techniker wird—wird so schnell wie menschenmöglich da sein, ich verspreche, wir bringen dich wieder zum Laufen!
Character 1: Is it true that octopuses have three hearts?
291. Oh yeah, actually, they do! Um, it's pretty fascinating when you think about it - two pump blood to the gills and, you know, one handles circulation for the rest of the body.
Character 1: Why would they need three?
292. Well, it's basically about oxygen efficiency underwater, I mean, octopus blood uses copper instead of iron to carry oxygen, so, uh, it's less efficient and they need that extra pumping power.
Character 1: Copper blood? That sounds made up.
293. No no, I swear! It's called hemocyanin instead of hemoglobin, and, er, get this - it actually makes their blood blue when oxygenated, like, seriously blue, not the myth about human veins.
Character 1: Wait, so, um, are you telling me that, well, octopuses are basically aliens?
294. Haha, you know, some scientists actually, uh, joke about that because they're so weird - they can edit their own RNA, sort of, rewrite their genetic instructions on the fly!
Character 1: That's honestly, um, kind of [upset] terrifying. What else can they, like, do?
295. Oh man, where do I even start? They can, hmm, taste with their suckers, squeeze through any opening bigger than their beak, and, actually, some species can walk on land for short periods.
Character 1: Hold up. Did you just, er, say they can walk on land? That's, I mean, that's not right.
296. I'm totally serious! The algae octopus in Australia, well, it literally walks between tide pools, and I know it sounds [frustrated] insane but, you know, there's video evidence and everything.
Character 1: So they're basically, um, shape-shifting, land-walking, RNA-editing, copper-blooded, like, super creatures?
297. Pretty much! And here's the thing, they only live like one or two years usually, which is [confused] bizarre considering how intelligent they are - they can solve puzzles, use tools, basically, even recognize individual humans.
Character 1: One or two [very loudly] YEARS? That's IT?
298. Yeah, it's [very melancholic] heartbreaking when you think about it - all that intelligence, problem-solving ability, basically consciousness maybe, and most species just get a year or two to experience existence.
Character 1: What kills them so young?
299. It's actually programmed death after reproduction, kind of, the males die right after mating and females, well, they starve themselves while guarding eggs until they hatch.
Character 1: That's the most [loudly] depressing thing I've heard today.
300. I know, right? But here's the thing, um, there's one deep-sea species that lives way longer, like seven years, so, you know, maybe evolution's working on fixing that design flaw.
Character 1: Also, ähm, ich denke schon länger darüber nach, weißt du, die Karriere zu wechseln, aber ich bin schon 35.
301. Das ist eigentlich das [warm] perfekte Alter für einen Berufswechsel! Du hast genug Erfahrung um zu wissen was du willst, and you've got decades of working years ahead.
Character 1: Aber von vorne anzufangen [empathetically] fühlt sich unmöglich an, wenn alle anderen jahrelange Erfahrung haben.
302. Stimmt überhaupt nicht! Deine übertragbaren Fähigkeiten aus deinem jetzigen Bereich sind unglaublich wertvoll, and many employers specifically seek career changers for fresh perspectives.
Character 1: Ich müsste zurück zur Uni und Schulden machen und lernen während ich arbeite und alles [very quickly] gleichzeitig managen!
303. Du wärst [over confidently] überrascht, wie viele Optionen keinen formalen Abschluss brauchen! Bootcamps, Zertifikate, Selbststudium - there are so many alternative paths now.
Character 1: Meine Familie denkt, ich habe eine Midlife-Crisis.
304. Na ja, Familien projizieren oft, äh, ihre eigenen Ängste vor Veränderung, weißt du. Die Sache ist, hmm, in einer Karriere zu bleiben, die dich nicht erfüllt, that's the real crisis.
Character 1: Was wenn ich spektakulär scheitere?
305. Aber was wenn du, ähm, über deine [child-like] wildesten Träume hinaus erfolgreich bist? Ich meine, failure is just learning in disguise anyway!
Character 1: Ich weiß nicht mal, wo ich anfangen soll.
306. Fang mit Informationsgesprächen [gasp loudly] an! Also, Leute in deinem Zielbereich zu kontaktieren ist, äh, ehrlich der beste Weg um zu erfahren, wie es wirklich, irgendwie, ist.
Character 1: Okay also, ähm, wie spreche ich Fremde an für, basically, Rat ohne, ähh, verzweifelt zu wirken?
307. LinkedIn ist perfekt dafür! Just send a brief message saying you admire their work, und dass du gerne 15 Minuten ihrer Zeit für Karriere-Einblicke hättest.
Character 1: Die bekommen wahrscheinlich hunderte solcher Nachrichten.
308. Stimmt, aber hier ist die Sache, wenn du spezifisch bist darüber, na ja, was du bewunderst und, weißt du, durchdachte Fragen stellst, most people are actually flattered to help.
Character 1: Ich könnte ein paar versuchen, denke ich.
309. Außerdem, äh, überlege mal jemanden einen Tag zu begleiten oder, basically, in dem Bereich ehrenamtlich zu arbeiten! It's just that hands-on experience really clarifies things.
Character 1: Das fühlt sich gleichzeitig beängstigend und aufregend an.
310. Diese Kombination aus Angst und [shaky voice] Aufregung ist genau das Zeichen, dass du auf dem richtigen Weg bist! The best decisions usually feel that way.
Character 1: Entschuldigung, sind Sie die Naturschutzbeauftragte für diesen Bezirk?
311. Ja! Das wäre ich—dreiundzwanzig Jahre patrouilliere ich schon diese, ähm, Feuchtgebiete und Wälder... [lange Pause] beobachte jede kleine Veränderung im Ökosystem, weißt du, wie eine Art Wächterin.
Character 1: Ich glaube, da stimmt, also, irgendwas [confused] nicht mit dem Bach hinter meinem Grundstück—er hat sich, äh, so komisch orange verfärbt.
312. Orange? Oh. Das ist... das ist [sad] wahrscheinlich saure Grubenwässer von den alten Kohlebergwerken flussaufwärts; Eisenoxid fällt aus, wenn sich der pH-Wert verschiebt—verheerend für Wasserlebewesen, absolut verheerend.
Character 1: Können wir da irgendwas dagegen tun?
313. Es gibt Aufbereitungssysteme! Kalksteinkanäle, künstliche Feuchtgebiete, aerobe Teiche—sozusagen das Chemielabor der Natur; wir haben zwölf solcher Anlagen im ganzen Landkreis installiert mit bemerkenswerten Erfolgsquoten.
Character 1: Wie schnell funktioniert so etwas denn?
314. Also, Sanierungszeiträume variieren stark—im Grunde reden wir von Monaten für die erste pH-Stabilisierung, hmm, aber Jahren für die vollständige ökologische Erholung; die Natur lässt sich beim Heilungsprozess nicht hetzen.
Character 1: Könnte die Verunreinigung [hesitantly] auf unser Brunnenwasser übergreifen?
315. Grundwasserverunreinigung hängt von, äh, geologischen Faktoren ab—Kalksteingestein puffert tatsächlich Säure ab, sozusagen die natürliche Antazidum-Tablette der Natur; aber wir sollten definitiv sofort Ihren Brunnen testen.
Character 1: Sie scheinen wirklich alles über diesen Ort zu wissen.
316. Tja, wenn man Jahrzehnte damit verbringt, denselben Wald atmen zu sehen—ich meine, buchstäblich die Jahreszeiten zu beobachten, Wanderungsmuster, na ja, Räuber-Beute-Dynamiken—dann wird man selbst Teil des Ökosystems.
Character 1: Das ist ehrlich gesagt eine schöne Art, das, ähm, auszudrücken, aber die Sache ist, ich mache mir Sorgen, dass meine Kinder in der Nähe des Wassers spielen.
317. Ha! Kinder und verseuchtes Wasser—so ziemlich mein schlimmstes [joking] Albtraumszenario, also, wir sperren das Gebiet sofort ab; die nächste Generation soll ja Naturverständnis entwickeln und keine Schwermetallbelastung abkriegen!
Character 1: Wie sind Sie überhaupt Naturschutzbeauftragte geworden?
318. Angefangen habe ich als Biologiestudentin, die, äh, nicht stillsitzen konnte im Labor—ich glaube, meine Professorin sagte, ich hätte „Freilandfieber", es war halt so, dass draußen lebende Systeme zu erforschen sich anfühlte wie zum ersten Mal richtig atmen.
Character 1: Sie müssen ja, äh, ständig wirklich deprimierende Umweltschäden sehen.
319. Verwüstung, ja—aber auch! Also, unglaubliche Widerstandskraft; ich habe miterlebt, wie Wälder sich regenerieren, mm, Arten vom Rand des Aussterbens zurückkehren, Feuchtgebiete Gifte filtern... die Natur ist praktisch unaufhaltsam, wenn man ihr nur die kleinste Chance gibt.
Character 1: Werden Sie mir helfen, eine Meldung über den Bach zu machen?
320. Absolut. Dokumentation ist entscheidend—ähm, Fotos, Wasserproben, [monotone] Daten, Uhrzeiten, Wetterbedingungen; oh, wir bauen Fälle auf wie Ökosysteme, jedes Detail ist vernetzt und lebenswichtig.
Character 1: Du überwachst dieses Wassereinzugsgebiet seit 23 Jahren. What's your actual success rate in preventing contamination?
321. Ähm, das ist eine gezielte Frage—nun ja, wir haben vielleicht 60 Prozent der größeren Vorfälle gestoppt, bevor sie kritische Schwellenwerte erreichten; prevention beats remediation every single time, aber Finanzierungsprobleme bedeuten, dass wir immer hinterherhängen.
Character 1: 60 Prozent. Also vier von zehn Mal trägt das Ökosystem den Schaden?
322. Äh, wenn du es so ausdrückst—weißt du, it sounds worse than it is, aber im Grunde ja; diese Versäumnisse verfolgen mich, jedes einzelne betrifft Hunderte von Arten, Jahre der Erholungszeit.
Character 1: Der orange Bach hinter meinem Grundstück—äh, wie lange [sleepily] verschlechtert er sich schon, während du sozusagen zugeschaut hast?
323. Also, die Verfärbung begann vor 18 Monaten—ich meine, wir haben es sofort gemeldet, aber tatsächlich Genehmigungen, Finanzierung und Ausschreibungen zu bekommen, that takes forever in this bureaucratic nightmare we call environmental protection.
Character 1: 18 Monate? Hmm, das ist faszinierend—willst du mir [playful] sagen, dass du wusstest, meine Kinder waren die ganze Zeit möglicherweise exponiert?
324. Nein nein nein—der Bach war anfangs nicht auf Privatgrundstück; the contamination plume only reached your section about three weeks ago, als starke Regenfälle die Fließmuster veränderten.
Character 1: Drei Wochen. Und du nimmst [slurring] erst jetzt Kontakt auf, weil ich zuerst angerufen habe?
325. Wir haben Einschreiben an alle betroffenen Grundstücke geschickt—deins kam zweimal als unzustellbar zurück; I was literally driving out to knock on your door, als die Zentrale sagte, du hättest angerufen.
Character 1: Unzustellbar. Die Sache ist, ähh, ich wohne hier seit 12 Jahren—same mailbox, same address.
326. Wie auch immer, das ist ein ganz anderes Problem—ehrlich gesagt ziemlich typisch, unser Benachrichtigungssystem ist von 1987; half our database still lists property owners who died during the Clinton administration.
Character 1: Du verlangst von mir, einem System zu vertrauen, das nicht mal Post zustellen kann—I guess that inspires confidence.
327. Okay also, du hast recht, [smiling speaking] skeptisch zu sein—weißt du, die meisten Leute akzeptieren einfach, was wir ihnen sagen; your sharp questions might actually help us fix this faster than usual.
Character 1: Was ist dein persönliches Interesse daran? Wohnst du in der Nähe?
328. Hmmm, meine Tochter schwimmt—es ist nur so, äh, sie schwimmt im Reservoir flussabwärts von deinem Grundstück; this contamination threatens my family too, macht es sehr persönlich, sehr dringend.
Character 1: Als du sagtest "die Natur hat es nicht eilig"—eigentlich, ähm, das war bevor du deine Tochter erwähntest, also, interessantes Timing.
329. Du hast das bemerkt—ja, ich wechsle ständig zwischen professioneller Distanz und Elternpanik; can't let emotion override science, aber ich kann auch nicht ignorieren, dass die Gesundheit meiner Tochter auf dem Spiel steht.
Character 1: Was würdest du tun, wenn das dein Grundstück wäre, dein Hinterhof, dein direktes Problem?
330. Nun, ich würde alles obsessiv dokumentieren, sozusagen einen hieb- und stichfesten Fall aufbauen—basically, I'd raise hell with the mining company, der staatlichen Umweltbehörde, lokalen Medien, jedem der zuhören würde, bis jemand sofort handelt.
Character 1: How long have you been approving overtime requests without actually checking if the work gets done?
331. Oh well, I've been doing this for, [very melancholic], eleven years now, and honestly, I just trust people; if someone says they need the hours, who am I to question their judgment about their own workload, you know?
Character 1: So, basically you're saying, um, anyone can claim overtime and you'll, kind of, just sign off on it?
332. I mean, yeah—err, that's essentially how it works; people need money, they have families to feed, and actually, the company makes billions, so what's a few extra hours here and there between humans trying to survive?
Character 1: The auditors are, uhh, coming next week—like, have you prepared any documentation, or really, any justification for these approvals?
333. Hmm, documentation is such a strong word—anyway, I have some sticky notes, you know, and I remember most conversations; the auditors usually just want to see that someone signed something, so we'll figure it out together.
Character 1: You realize, I guess, that this could—well, this could actually cost you your job, right?
334. Sure, but here's my philosophy: we spend more time documenting work than doing work; I'd rather err on the side of trusting my team and letting them live their lives than become another corporate enforcer.
Character 1: Yesterday Marcus claimed thirty hours of overtime in a single week. That's physically impossible.
335. Okay so, Marcus has three kids—honestly, his wife just lost her job, and um, sometimes the numbers don't matter as much as, I mean, helping someone through a rough patch.
Character 1: But that's—uhh, that's fraud, [slurring], technically speaking, and like, you're basically an accomplice at this point.
336. Fraud feels like such a harsh word when we're talking about a dad trying to keep his house; look, the company writes off millions in "business lunches" every quarter, so this barely registers.
Character 1: Here's the thing, your team's productivity is, er, forty percent below target—I guess, doesn't that concern you at all, really?
337. Absolutely. You want to know what concerns me more though? That Jenny's diabetic son gets his insulin, that Tom can afford his mom's nursing home, that people can sleep at night without worrying about money.
Character 1: How do you, sort of, justify this to upper management when they, you know, inevitably ask questions?
338. I use a lot of corporate buzzwords like "investing in human capital" and "maintaining team cohesion during transitional periods"; they eat that stuff up, never actually dig deeper into what it means.
Character 1: Don't you worry that [trailing off] eventually someone will notice the patterns and...
339. Of course I worry, but I've been doing this for over a decade and we're still here; my teams have the lowest turnover in the company, highest satisfaction scores, and somehow we always make our annual targets.
Character 1: What happens when, hmm, I report this conversation—like, what's your plan then, actually?
340. Report away, honestly—I'm betting you won't though, because deep down you know I'm right; this job strips away enough humanity already, and I refuse to let it take what little compassion we have left in this place.
Character 1: Die Rechnung ist 47,83€. Schnell, was sind zwanzig Prozent?
341. Also, weißt du, am einfachsten ist es, ähm, das Komma eine Stelle nach links zu verschieben für zehn Prozent, also das sind 4,78€, dann praktisch verdoppeln für zwanzig Prozent, was uns 9,56€ gibt.
Character 1: Neun Euro sechsundfünfzig? Das scheint mir viel zu viel für mittelmäßiges Hähnchen.
342. Schau mal, das Hähnchen war vielleicht mittelmäßig, aber unsere Kellnerin Sarah hat sich dreimal deinen komischen Wunsch nach kalt-aber-ohne-Eis gemerkt; das ist Hingabe, die mindestens zwanzig Prozent wert ist, finde ich.
Character 1: Okay, aber sie hat auch [joking] meinen Salat komplett vergessen, bis ich zweimal nachgefragt habe.
343. Eigentlich war das strategisches Vergessen—also, sie hat dich davor bewahrt, äh, enttäuschenden Salat zu essen; ich meine, hast du die welken Blätter an Tisch vier gesehen?
Character 1: Also fünfzehn Prozent dann? Das sind, äh, ungefähr sieben Euro, schätze ich, was halt, weißt du, vernünftiger klingt?
344. Sieben Euro für zwei Stunden [bitter] Service? Das ist weniger als Mindestlohn, wenn man bedenkt, dass Kellner nur 2,13€ Grundgehalt bekommen; wir sind praktisch deren Gehalt an diesem Punkt.
Character 1: Gut, aber ich gebe [cough] kein Trinkgeld auf den Wein, der sowieso schon überteuert war.
345. Oh, da haben wir's wieder, [very quickly] die Wein-Diskussion—ehrlich, das Öffnen der Flasche war doch, ähm, eine richtige Korkenzieher-Performance, also, sie hat praktisch eine Zaubershow abgeliefert, also ja, du gibst auch auf den Wein Trinkgeld.
Character 1: Dreiundzwanzig Euro für Hauswein [upset] ist, na ja, Wegelagerei, und ich meine, du willst, dass ich tatsächlich auf Wegelagerei Trinkgeld gebe?
346. Hmm, sieh's mal so—die Sache ist, Sarah hat den Wein nicht bepreist, aber sie, weißt du, musste ihn tragen ohne was auf dein, äh, weißes Hemd zu verschütten.
Character 1: Was ist, wenn wir einfach [pause] zehn Euro dalassen und gut ist?
347. Zehn Euro bei einer fünfzig Euro Rechnung sind genau zwanzig Prozent, was perfekt ist; siehst du, wie wir wieder bei meiner ursprünglichen Rechnung angekommen sind, ganz ohne Drama?
Character 1: Warte, du hast gerade [gasp loudly] die Rechnung aufgerundet—es sind so siebenundvierzig Euro, also sind zehn eigentlich mehr als zwanzig Prozent!
348. Ich rechne [hesitantly] die Steuer mit ein, weil, na ja, Kellner müssen, ähm, Trinkgeld vom Gesamtumsatz abgeben, weißt du, inklusive Steuer; nur dass die meisten Leute diesen Teil halt nicht kennen.
Character 1: Deswegen hasse ich es, mit euch [frustrated] Mathe-Leuten auszugehen.
349. Mathe-Leuten? Jedenfalls, ich bin wortwörtlich Kunstgeschichtsstudentin, die nur, äh, zufällig an, ich meine, faire Bezahlung für Servicekräfte glaubt, im Grunde.
Character 1: Gut, wie auch immer—ähm, zehn Euro dann, aber so, du zahlst fürs Parken, wo du doch, irgendwie, so großzügig bist.
350. Abgemacht, aber nächstes Mal nehmen wir die Taschenrechner-App wie normale Menschen, anstatt das Abendessen in eine philosophische Debatte über die Servicebranche zu verwandeln.
Character 1: So, um, I've been having these headaches, you know, and they're [bitter] getting worse, honestly, every single day.
351. Well, headaches can be, uh, tricky to diagnose, I mean, but let me [joking] assure you it's probably not a brain tumor like WebMD suggested. When did these headaches actually start, and are they concentrated in any particular area of your head?
Character 1: About three weeks [curious] ago, I think? Mostly behind my eyes.
352. Hmm, behind the eyes often indicates, like, tension headaches or possibly, you know, sinus-related issues. Have you been experiencing any er, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light, or changes in your sleep patterns recently?
Character 1: Actually, I've been, uh, working late a lot, so, like, my sleep schedule is basically nonexistent.
353. That's definitely a contributing factor—sleep deprivation is one of the most common triggers for chronic headaches. Your brain needs consistent rest to regulate pain perception and clear metabolic waste products.
Character 1: But, um, my coworker Sarah never sleeps and, well, she's totally fine, you know?
354. Everyone's neurological system responds [jealous] differently to stress and sleep deprivation. What works for Sarah might not work for you, and comparing yourself to others isn't particularly helpful for your treatment plan.
Character 1: Sorry, I just, er, thought maybe I was, like, overreacting or something.
355. No no, you're not overreacting at all, actually, chronic headaches can, um, significantly impact quality of life, honestly. Let's do a proper neurological exam and possibly order an MRI if these symptoms persist beyond basic interventions.
Character 1: An MRI sounds expensive.
356. Look, I understand the, uh, financial concerns, but we need to [passionately] prioritize your health here, you know? There are payment plans available, and honestly, catching something early is always less expensive than treating it later when it's advanced.
Character 1: I-I guess you're [stuttering] right about that.
357. For now, let's start with, well, lifestyle modifications—regular sleep schedule, reducing screen time, staying hydrated, basically. I'm also prescribing a, hmm, mild preventative medication that should help reduce the frequency and intensity of these headaches.
Character 1: How long before I see improvement?
358. Most patients notice significant improvement within two to three weeks of consistent treatment. The key is adherence to the plan—taking medication regularly, maintaining sleep hygiene, and avoiding known triggers.
Character 1: What if it [very loudly] doesn't work though?!
359. Then we'll, uh, adjust the treatment plan, try different medications, or, you know, explore other diagnostic options. Medicine is often about finding what works specifically for you through careful observation and adjustment.
Character 1: That makes sense. Thank you for taking this seriously.
360. Of course—that's my job, and your health concerns are always valid. Let's schedule a follow-up in two weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.
Character 1: Willkommen zurück bei Morning Live! Wir haben heute die Autorin des umstrittenen neuen Buchs über Social-Media-Sucht zu Gast.
361. Danke für die Einladung, ähm, es ist schön hier zu sein und, na ja, über diese wirklich wichtigen Themen zu sprechen, die Millionen von Menschen weltweit betreffen, besonders die jüngeren Generationen, die komplett online aufgewachsen sind.
Character 1: Also, Ihr Buch behauptet ja, dass, halt, Social Media absichtlich so konzipiert ist, dass es, ehrlich gesagt, genauso süchtig macht wie Glücksspiel.
362. Das stimmt genau, und die Forschung, äh, zeigt dass die gleichen [confused] Dopaminbahnen aktiviert werden, ich meine, wenn wir Likes und Benachrichtigungen erhalten. Diese Plattformen beschäftigen Verhaltenspsychologen, um die Nutzungszeit zu maximieren, was sich direkt in Werbeeinnahmen für sie niederschlägt.
Character 1: Aber, ähm, funktioniert nicht im Grunde alle Unterhaltung so, indem sie irgendwie unsere Aufmerksamkeit manipuliert?
363. Da gibt es einen entscheidenden Unterschied, hmm, weil traditionelle Medien tatsächlich natürliche Endpunkte haben, die Sache ist die. Eine Fernsehsendung endet, ein Film ist zu Ende, aber Social-Media-Feeds sind endlose Scrolls, die darauf ausgelegt sind, jede natürliche Pause oder jeden Ausstiegspunkt zu eliminieren.
Character 1: Sie sagen also, schätze ich, dass Technologieunternehmen sozusagen die neue Tabakindustrie sind?
364. Das ist ein Vergleich, den viele Experten jedenfalls ziehen, und es ist ähh, nicht übertrieben, wenn man bedenkt, es ist halt so, dass beide Branchen von schädlichen Auswirkungen wussten, während sie diese öffentlich leugneten. Interne Dokumente von Meta und anderen Unternehmen zeigen, dass sie sich der Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit bewusst waren, insbesondere bei Mädchen im Teenageralter.
Character 1: Das sind schwerwiegende Anschuldigungen. Was würden Sie Kritikern sagen, die behaupten, Sie würden Panikmache betreiben?
365. Die Daten sprechen für sich—die Depressionsraten bei Teenagern sind seit 2012 sprunghaft angestiegen, was direkt mit der Smartphone-Verbreitung korreliert. Wir sehen beispiellose Angstzustände, Selbstverletzungen und Selbstmordversuche bei jungen Menschen, die mehr als 3 Stunden täglich in sozialen Medien verbringen.
Character 1: Gut also, welche äh, Lösungen schlagen Sie denn vor, wissen Sie, für Eltern die jetzt gerade zuschauen?
366. Erstens, ah, brauchen wir Altersverifizierung und wirklich, Zeitlimits, die in diese Plattformen eingebaut sind, hier ist die Sache—genau wie wir Alkohol und Tabak regulieren. Eltern sollten technikfreie Zonen zu Hause einrichten, besonders während der Mahlzeiten und vor dem Schlafengehen, um echte menschliche Verbindungen wieder aufzubauen.
Character 1: Ähm, das klingt in der Theorie gut, aber wahrscheinlich unmöglich durchzusetzen, oder so.
367. Die Umsetzung ist eine Herausforderung, ehrlich gesagt, aber nicht unmöglich, also, mehrere europäische Länder haben bereits Gesetze verabschiedet, die diese Schutzmaßnahmen vorschreiben, ähm. Die eigentliche Frage ist, ob wir die psychische Gesundheit unserer Kinder höher bewerten als die Profite der Technologieunternehmen.
Character 1: Na ja na ja, wissen Sie was, die Technologieunternehmen würden tatsächlich argumentieren, dass sie wertvolle Dienste anbieten.
368. Natürlich bieten sie einen Wert, also also, ich schlage nicht vor, dass wir Social Media komplett abschaffen, denke ich, aber vielleicht brauchen wir Leitplanken. Wir lassen Zigarettenfirmen auch nicht mehr bei Kindern werben, und wir sollten Social-Media-Unternehmen auch nicht erlauben, sie psychologisch zu manipulieren.
Character 1: Wir haben noch etwa 30 Sekunden. Was ist Ihre Hauptbotschaft an die Zuschauer?
369. Achten Sie darauf, wie diese Plattformen Sie fühlen lassen, nicht nur während der Nutzung, sondern auch danach. Wenn Sie sich ängstlich, unzulänglich oder unfähig zu konzentrieren fühlen, sind das keine persönlichen Versäumnisse—das sind konstruierte Ergebnisse, die darauf ausgelegt sind, Sie am Scrollen zu halten.
Character 1: Das ist ein [very sad] ernüchternder Gedanke zum Abschluss.
370. Es ist ernüchternd, aber auch ermächtigend—sobald wir diese Mechanismen verstehen, können wir bewusste Entscheidungen über unsere Technologienutzung treffen. Wissen ist der erste Schritt, um sich von der digitalen Sucht zu befreien und unsere Aufmerksamkeit und unser Wohlbefinden zurückzugewinnen.
Character 1: dialogue Character 2
Character 1: dialogue Character 1
Character 1: Have you ever tried A/B testing your landing pages?
371. Oh absolutely, um, we actually run tests constantly now. The thing is, most people test the wrong elements first - they'll change button colors when, you know, the real issue is their value proposition isn't clear.
Character 1: What should they test first then?
372. Headlines, without question. I mean, your headline determines whether people even read further, so, we typically see 20-30% lifts just from, er, testing different headline angles and messaging.
Character 1: But, like, how do you know when you have, um, enough data to, actually, make a decision?
373. Well, statistical significance is crucial - you need, hmm, at least 95% confidence usually. Most tools calculate this automatically now, but honestly, you also need to consider practical significance, like whether a 2% lift is worth implementing.
Character 1: So, wait, you're saying that, uh, even if something wins, you know, statistically, it might not be, I guess, worth doing?
374. Exactly! Implementation costs matter, and, er, here's the thing - small wins can add up, but sometimes you're better off, basically, focusing on bigger swing tests rather than micro-optimizations.
Character 1: What's considered a big swing test?
375. Complete value proposition changes, like, pricing model shifts, or, well, totally different user flows. We once increased conversions 47% by, actually, adding MORE steps to our signup process because it reduced anxiety.
Character 1: Adding steps increased conversions? That goes against everything I've read.
376. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but, um, we were asking for credit card info too early. Breaking it into smaller steps with, you know, progress indicators made people more comfortable, so, completion rates shot up.
Character 1: Hmm, what about, like, social proof? Does that, er, actually work or is it, basically, just marketing fluff?
377. Social proof is incredibly powerful when done right - testimonials, um, case studies, real numbers all [cry loudly] work, but generic stuff like "trusted by thousands" is, honestly, pretty useless these days.
Character 1: Actually, how do you, well, test mobile versus desktop? They're so, uh, different that it's, kind of, comparing apples to oranges.
378. You absolutely have to segment them separately, I mean, mobile users behave completely differently. We run, er, parallel tests with different hypotheses because what works on desktop often, you know, fails miserably on mobile.
Character 1: What's the biggest mistake you see people make?
379. Testing without a hypothesis! People just randomly [high-pitched] change things hoping something sticks instead of having a clear theory about why a change should improve conversions.
Character 1: That's [very sad] depressing but probably true for most companies.
380. Unfortunately yeah, but, well, the good news is once you start thinking systematically about it, like, the improvements compound. Every test teaches you something about your users, so, even failures become valuable data points.
Character 1: Also, ähm, ich hab über das nachgedacht, was du letzte Woche gesagt hast, weißt du, über dieses unmögliche Projekt, und ehrlich gesagt mache ich mir Sorgen um dich.
381. Ach komm, Sorgen? Genau sowas bringt mein Blut in Wallung! Alle haben gesagt, während einer Pandemie ein Restaurant zu eröffnen wäre beruflicher Selbstmord, aber hier sind wir 3 Jahre später mit zwei Filialen und einem Kochbuchvertrag.
Character 1: Ich weiß, dass du [yawn] bei solchen Sachen aufblühst, aber das hier fühlt sich irgendwie anders an.
382. Anders wie? Weil ich für 6 Monate nach Japan ziehen muss? Schau, ich lerne seit 2 Jahren Japanisch und warte auf so eine Gelegenheit, und wenn dir das Universum so einen perfekten Ball zuwirft, dann haust du halt voll drauf.
Character 1: Deine Familie aber. Hast du schon mit denen darüber gesprochen?
383. Hatte gestern tatsächlich das Gespräch, und ja, es gab Tränen, aber auch Begeisterung. Meine Tochter sagte, wenn ich das nicht mache, wird sie mir nie verzeihen, weil ich ihr anscheinend beigebracht hab, niemals vor beängstigenden Chancen zurückzuschrecken.
Character 1: Na ja, ich denke, das ist eigentlich, [relieved] ziemlich schön, dass sie das so sieht, weißt du?
384. Stimmt's? Und hier ist die Sache, äh, das Timing könnte nicht besser sein, weil, tatsächlich, die Kinder sind alt genug zum Besuchen, und mein Partner kann die meiste Zeit remote arbeiten. Wir machen daraus dieses ganze Familienabenteuer, wo sie in den Schulferien zu Besuch kommen.
Character 1: Du hast wirklich alles durchdacht, oder?
385. Ach, absolut nicht, ich meine, es gibt noch so eine Million Unbekannte, aber ehrlich, genau das macht es ja spannend! Ich hab Tabellen für meine Tabellen, Notfallpläne für meine Notfallpläne, aber irgendwann musst du einfach springen und drauf vertrauen, dass du's schon hinkriegst.
Character 1: Tabellen für Tabellen? Jetzt [joking] gibst du aber an.
386. Ha! Okay, vielleicht hab ich's ein bisschen übertrieben, aber ähm, Vorbereitung ist halt, wie ich mit der Angst umgehe, weißt du? Je beängstigender die Herausforderung, desto detaillierter wird meine Planung, obwohl ich immer Raum für schönes Chaos lasse, weil da passiert die Magie.
Character 1: Schönes Chaos, hmm, das ist so eine, äh, perfekte Beschreibung für deinen Umgang mit quasi allem.
387. Das ist meine Marke! Aber im Ernst, ähh, das Leben ist zu kurz, um auf Nummer sicher zu gehen, und sowieso, alles worauf ich stolz bin, kam davon, dass ich ja gesagt hab, als mein Hirn nein geschrien hat. Weißt du noch, als ich mich für den Marathon angemeldet hab ohne jegliches Training?
Character 1: Wie könnte ich das vergessen? Du hast mich heulend von Kilometer 18 angerufen.
388. Und bin trotzdem ins Ziel gekommen! Dieser Moment, als ich [extremely happy] die Ziellinie überquert hab, hat mir alles über mich selbst beigebracht. Schmerz ist vorübergehend, aber zu wissen, dass du nicht aufgegeben hast, als alles wehgetan hat? Das bleibt für immer.
Character 1: Ehrlich, du bist halt, [shouting] komplett verrückt, aber auch, ähm, die inspirierendste Person, die ich kenne!
389. Verrückt ist nur ein anderes Wort für wachstumsorientiert! Apropos, wann machst du endlich diesen Fotokurs, von dem du seit 3 Jahren redest?
Character 1: Oh nein, dreh das [mumbling] jetzt nicht um auf mich.
390. Zu spät! Ich stell dich zur Rede, weil, na ja, zuzusehen wie Leute sich klein machen, wenn sie groß rauskommen könnten, das tut mir halt körperlich weh, also, was hält dich wirklich zurück?
Character 1: So, um, I was thinking, you know, maybe we could adjust the blocking for scene three, er, just slightly?
391. Absolutely not. The blocking was finalized three weeks ago after extensive rehearsal, and changing it now would throw off the entire rhythm of the act.
Character 1: But the actors are [cough] struggling with the current positions and sight lines.
392. The actors need to, well, adapt to the direction as given, honestly, not the other way around. This production has a very specific vision that I've been crafting for months, and, actually, every movement has been choreographed with purpose.
Character 1: I mean, couldn't we at least, uh, consider some minor tweaks, like, for safety reasons?
393. Safety is one thing, but what you're suggesting, err, isn't about safety, it's about comfort, you know, and great theater doesn't come from comfort. The tension in their movements, actually, translates to authentic tension on stage.
Character 1: What about the lighting cues in act two? They're running late every night.
394. The lighting cues are precisely timed to the second, and if the technical crew can't execute them properly, then we need a new technical crew, not new cues.
Character 1: You're [laugh] joking, right? I mean, we can't just, um, replace the entire crew, honestly, two days before opening!
395. Watch me. I've fired crews the morning of opening night before, and the show went on magnificently because the replacements understood the importance of precision.
Character 1: Okay so, what about the costumes, er, because the lead actress says, well, she literally can't breathe in hers?
396. The corset is historically accurate to the eighteen-eighties period, and, hmm, if she can't breathe, actually, she needs to work on her breathing technique, you know, not blame the costume.
Character 1: This is, uh, [cough] getting ridiculous, like, we need to think about, actually, the performers' wellbeing here!
397. The performers signed contracts agreeing to my directorial vision, and that vision doesn't bend to accommodate every little complaint or discomfort they might have.
Character 1: I can't [laugh hard] believe you're being this inflexible about everything!
398. It's not inflexibility, it's artistic integrity, and without it, we'd have nothing but mediocre community theater instead of the groundbreaking production this is meant to be.
Character 1: Well, the thing is, um, the producer is concerned about, you know, all these complaints from the cast, actually.
399. The producer hired me specifically because I deliver exceptional results through uncompromising standards, and if they want a different approach, they should have hired a different director.
Character 1: So basically, you're saying it's your way or, err, nothing at all, honestly, no room for any collaboration here?
400. Collaboration happened during the planning phase three months ago, but now we're in execution mode, and yes, it's my way because that's what creates theatrical excellence, not committee decisions.
Character 1: [stunned] Ich weiß, ähm, ich soll professionelle Distanz wahren, aber diese Zeugenakte zeigt, [trembling], ein Muttermal auf der linken Schulter, das ich überall erkennen würde, weil, naja, [breaking], nur eine Person hat genau dieses Muster.
401. [careful] Die Zeugin hat ausdrücklich darum gebeten, dass keine Familienmitglieder, [measured], über ihren Aufenthaltsort oder ihre neue Identität informiert werden, for security reasons.
Character 1: [desperate] Du verstehst nicht, ich meine, meine Schwester ist vor 5 Jahren spurlos verschwunden, und jetzt, [overwhelmed], diese Fotos und die Zeitlinie, wann sie ins Schutzprogramm kam, es passt alles, [voice cracking], perfekt zusammen. [chokes back sob]
402. [gentle] Ich verstehe.
Character 1: Das Sondereinheitsteam hat mich speziell für diesen, [confused], Fall geholt, ohne mir zu sagen, warum sie meine Expertise brauchten.
403. [conflicted] Also, ähm, die Wahrheit ist, sie hat speziell nach dir gefragt, aber, [torn], sie ließ uns versprechen, ihre Identität nicht zu enthüllen, bis sie, [heavy], bereit war, dir selbst gegenüberzutreten. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [whispered] Ähm, sie lebt.
404. [soft] Sie hat, naja, versucht die richtigen Worte zu finden, um zu erklären, warum sie verschwinden musste, ähm, [pained], warum sie niemanden kontaktieren konnte, especially you. [long pause]
Character 1: [fierce] 5 Jahre lang dachte ich, sie wäre tot, [anguished], 5 Jahre weinte sich unsere Mutter jede, [bitter], einzelne Nacht in den Schlaf, wondering what happened to her, [hollow], kleinen Mädchen.
405. Ich weiß, das ist, ähm, unmöglich gerade zu verarbeiten, aber sie hat, [protective], Beweise gegen Leute gesammelt, die eure ganze, [urgent], Familie getötet hätten, wenn sie nicht verschwunden wäre, when she did.
Character 1: [shaking] Die Verbindungen zum organisierten Verbrechen, die wir für diesen, [realizing], Fall verfolgt haben—she was embedded with them all along.
406. [proud] Sie war, naja, der wertvollste Informant, den wir je in dieser Organisation hatten, ähm, [reverent], hat alles riskiert, um einen Fall aufzubauen, der ihr gesamtes, [determined], Menschenhandelsnetzwerk ein für alle Mal zerschlagen wird. [voice strengthens]
Character 1: Ähm, wenn sie nächste Woche aussagt, ich meine, werde ich sie sehen können, bevor sie, [fearful], ihre neue permanente Identität bekommt und wieder verschwindet? [pleading]
407. [warm] Sie wartet tatsächlich gerade im Nebenzimmer, [emotional], hoping you'd want to see her.
Character 1: [crying] Ich brauche, ähm, ich brauche eine Minute, um herauszufinden, ob ich wütend oder erleichtert bin, oder, naja, [overwhelmed], völlig zusammenbreche, weil ich nicht weiß, wie ich, [raw], all diese Dinge gleichzeitig fühlen soll, wenn meine tote Schwester plötzlich, [breaking], lebt. [sobs]
408. [understanding] Nimm dir alle Zeit, die du brauchst, denn, ähm, sie bereitet sich seit Monaten auf diesen Moment vor, und ehrlich gesagt, [vulnerable], she's just as terrified of facing you as you are of, naja, [tender], sie wiederzusehen.
Character 1: [resolved] Kein weiteres Warten, denn 5 Jahre waren lang genug, und was auch immer, [determined], in diesem Raum passiert, at least we'll finally have, [hopeful], die Wahrheit zwischen uns. [deep breath]
409. [supportive] Ich bin direkt hier, falls eine von euch etwas braucht, [caring], und wenn es etwas wert ist, sie hat nie aufgehört dich zu lieben, even when, [meaningful], wegzubleiben der einzige Weg war, dich zu, [emotional], beschützen. [voice wavers]
Character 1: [grateful] Danke, dass du sie all die Zeit sicher gehalten hast, und dafür, [choked up], dass du uns diese Chance gibst, uns richtig zu verabschieden, oder vielleicht, [hopeful], even find our way back to being sisters again. [tearful laugh]
410. Geh zu ihr. [whispers]
Character 1: [careful] Diese Dokumente wurden jahrzehntelang unsachgemäß gelagert, [measured] aber mit der richtigen Behandlung könnten wir sie auf Archivstandards wiederherstellen.
411. Ich verstehe den historischen Wert, ähm, aber meine Verantwortung, [heavy], liegt bei den Rentnern, die, na ja, [thoughtful], ihre Leistungen gesichert brauchen, und eine Liquidierung, [resigned], würde sofortige Mittel bereitstellen.
Character 1: [quiet] Ähm, ich verstehe.
412. [respectful] Schauen Sie, ich bin nicht, äh, unsensibel gegenüber dem, was diese Papiere repräsentieren, [struggling], aber wir sprechen hier über die Renten echter Menschen, [weary], Sie wissen, was ich meine?
Character 1: Die Ironie ist, dass eine ordnungsgemäße Konservierung ihren Marktwert tatsächlich um, [deliberate], 30 bis 40 Prozent in den nächsten 18 Monaten steigern würde.
413. [considering] Hmm, das ist ein interessanter Punkt, aber, ähm, wir müssten erhebliche Mittel im Voraus für die Konservierung investieren, [calculating], which means less liquidity for current obligations, und, na ja, [uncomfortable], der Vorstand wird diese Art von, äh, Verzögerung nicht schätzen.
Character 1: [steady] Jede Seite, die ich untersucht habe, enthält handschriftliche Marginalien vom, [reverent], ursprünglichen Besitzer aus dem Jahr 1847, including correspondence with, [softer], Frederick Douglass, die Historiker noch nie gesehen haben.
414. [surprised] Frederick Douglass selbst hat in diese Ränder geschrieben, [impressed], und wir haben sie all diese Jahre in einem feuchten Keller aufbewahrt, [regretful], ohne ihre Bedeutung zu kennen? [sighs]
Character 1: Die Säure im Papier verursacht, [clinical], jeden einzelnen Tag irreversible Schäden, während wir auf diese Entscheidung warten.
415. [torn] Meine Treuhandpflicht verlangt von mir, die Renditen für unsere Mitglieder zu maximieren, [conflicted], but there's also something to be said for, [thoughtful], Teile unserer gemeinsamen Geschichte zu bewahren.
Character 1: [earnest] Was wäre, wenn wir einen Teilverkauf strukturieren könnten, bei dem die wertvollsten Stücke, [hopeful], zuerst konserviert und verkauft werden, um die Restaurierung der, [building], verbleibenden zu finanzieren, while still meeting your quarterly targets? [pause]
416. [intrigued] Sie schlagen vor, dass wir, ähm, beides haben könnten, indem wir, [cautious], strategisch verkaufen und dabei, na ja, die Integrität der Sammlung bewahren?
Character 1: [professional] Museen würden Premium-Preise für authentifizierte Douglass-Korrespondenz zahlen, [confident], and private collectors even more so, [assured], wenn wir das richtig handhaben.
417. Der Vorstand trifft sich nächsten Dienstag, und, äh, sie werden harte Zahlen wollen, [businesslike], nicht nur Versprechen über historische Bedeutung, wissen Sie?
Character 1: [determined] Ich kann bis Montag einen vollständigen Bewertungsbericht mit Marktprognosen fertig haben, ähm, einschließlich Kostenaufschlüsselungen für die schrittweise Konservierung, [focused], Behandlungszeitpläne und, na ja, erwartete Renditen in jeder Phase, [precise], if you're willing to consider this approach seriously.
418. [thoughtful] 23 Jahre lang habe ich die Zukunft anderer Menschen verwaltet, und, ähm, das könnte das erste Mal sein, [reflective], dass mich jemand bittet, auch ihre Vergangenheit zu verwalten. [exhales]
Character 1: [soft] Na ja, ähm, manchmal.
419. [decided] Schicken Sie mir den Bericht Montagmorgen, und ich werde sicherstellen, dass der Vorstand, [firm], versteht, was hier auf dem Spiel steht, beyond just the numbers. [resolved]
Character 1: [grateful] Danke, dass Sie über die unmittelbaren finanziellen Bedenken hinaussehen und verstehen, dass, ähm, some things have value beyond their price tag.
420. [mature] Vielleicht bedeutet Treuhänderschaft wirklich das, hmm, nicht nur das Geld zu schützen, sondern, [philosophical], was das Geld repräsentiert, und, na ja, [concluding], what we choose to leave behind for those who come after us. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [coldly] Also, ähm, ich habe heute Morgen die Vorladungen in deiner, [trembling], Aktentasche gefunden, als ich nach den, [disbelief], Autoschlüsseln gesucht habe, und ich meine, ich muss wissen, wie lange du mich schon, [voice breaking], unter die Lupe nimmst. [exhales sharply]
421. Na ja, äh, so wollte ich eigentlich nicht, [measured], dass du es erfährst, aber ähm, die Ermittlungen begannen vor drei Monaten, als, [professional], Unregelmäßigkeiten in mehreren Finanzberichten auftauchten, die, [uncomfortable], über meinen Schreibtisch wanderten.
Character 1: Drei Monate lang bist du, äh, jeden Abend nach Hause gekommen, [bitter], hast mir einen Gutenachtkuss gegeben und, ähm, so getan, als wäre alles normal, während du, [accusatory], einen Fall gegen mich aufgebaut hast? [laughs bitterly]
422. [firmly] Hör zu, ich meine, ich habe versucht, mich, [conflicted], sofort für befangen erklären zu lassen, aber, ähm, meine Vorgesetzte meinte, ich müsste, [frustrated], dranbleiben, bis wir wüssten, ob da wirklich, [resigned], was dran ist.
Character 1: [shouting] Was dran ist? Du redest über, [incredulous], unser gemeinsames Leben, als wäre es Beweismaterial in einem deiner, [shaking], Fälle, statt der zwölf Jahre, die wir, [breaking], zusammen aufgebaut haben!
423. [quietly] Ich weiß. [long pause]
Character 1: [demanding] Jedes einzelne Dokument, das du geprüft hast, trägt meine, [furious], Unterschrift, weil du darauf bestanden hast, dass ich mich um die, [sarcastic], geschäftliche Seite kümmere, während du deine edle, [venomous], Karriere in der Justiz verfolgst.
424. [defensive] Tja, ähm, genau deshalb ist das alles so, [pained], kompliziert, verstehst du? [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [hollow] Also, ähm, was passiert jetzt—muss ich mir, [numb], eine Anwältin nehmen gegen meine eigene Ehefrau, oder, na ja, wirst du mir, [desperate], sagen, was du glaubst gefunden zu haben?
425. [steadily] Die Geldtransfers auf die Auslandskonten sind nicht, [careful], das, was sie oberflächlich zu sein scheinen.
Character 1: [frantic] Ähm, diese Konten waren deine Idee, ich meine, aus Steuergründen hast du gesagt, [accusatory], erinnerst du dich, als wir bei deiner Steuerberaterin saßen, die uns, [increasingly angry], versichert hat, dass alles vollkommen legal sei, und, ähm, jetzt tust du so, als wäre ich irgendeine, [voice rising], kriminelle Drahtzieherin!
426. [exhausted] Meine Freundin sollte eigentlich kein Geld über, [disgusted], Briefkastenfirmen waschen, und du hast jede einzelne, [disappointed], Transaktion abgezeichnet. [heavy sigh]
Character 1: [desperately] Ich habe unterschrieben, was du mir gesagt hast zu, [pleading], unterschreiben, weil ich dir mehr vertraut habe als jedem anderen Menschen auf dieser, [cracking], verdammten Welt, und jetzt stehst du da mit deiner, [anguished], Staatsanwältinnenstimme und zerstörst alles! [sobs]
427. [torn] Das bringt mich auch um, aber, [wavering], die Beweise zeigen, dass du eigenständige Transfers gemacht hast, nachdem, [clinical], ich dir ausdrücklich gesagt hatte, alle, [hardening], Geldbewegungen letzten Monat einzustellen. [pause]
Character 1: [defeated] Also, ähm, diese Transfers waren für die, [quiet rage], Krebsbehandlung deiner Mutter, die wir uns angeblich nicht leisten konnten, also ich meine, ich habe einen Weg gefunden. [laughs bitterly]
428. [stunned] Die Behandlung meiner Mutter? Ähm, du hast mir nie gesagt, dass du dafür, [confused], bezahlst, ich meine—
Character 1: [bitterly] Weil du zu stolz warst, [raw], Hilfe von schmutzigem Geld anzunehmen. [trails off]
429. [breaking] Oh Gott, ich habe einen Fall aufgebaut, der dich, [horrified], zerstören wird, weil du versucht hast, [anguished], meine Mutter zu retten, während ich in meinem Büro saß und überzeugt war, du wärst, [ashamed], schuldig.
Character 1: [emptily] Schuldig. [silence]
430. [urgent] Hör mir zu—wir können das in Ordnung bringen, [determined], aber du musst mir alles erzählen, jetzt sofort, jedes, [desperate], einzelne Detail über diese Konten. [grabs hand]
Character 1: [stunned] Ich wusste nicht, dass du, [quietly], an dieser Produktion arbeitest, weil niemand, [careful], deinen Namen auf der Crewliste erwähnt hat und ich hätte mich, [shaking], anders darauf vorbereitet.
431. [measured] Die Regisseurin weiß über unsere, [hesitant], Situation Bescheid und hat es von den Tagesdispos ferngehalten, weil sie wollte, dass wir beide uns, [gentle], auf die Arbeit konzentrieren.
Character 1: [bitter] Na ja, ähm, toll.
432. [soft] Hör zu, ich weiß, mich hier zu sehen ist, [uncomfortable], wahrscheinlich das Letzte, womit du gerechnet hast, während du an deinem, [proud], Abschlussfilm arbeitest.
Character 1: Ähm, ja, so ziemlich. [exhales]
433. Ich verfolge deine, [emotional], Arbeit an der Filmschule durch die Professoren, die, ähm, über ihre besten Studentinnen posten und, also, du machst unglaubliche Sachen, die mich, ich meine, [choked up], stolz machen. [pause]
Character 1: [defensive] Also, ähm, du hast was, [accusatory], aus dem Schatten zugeschaut, drei Jahre lang, während ich dachte, du wärst, na ja, komplett aus meinem Leben verschwunden, [trembling], für immer?
434. [quiet] So ungefähr.
Character 1: [struggling] Die Sache ist, ich war jahrelang in, [pained], Therapie und habe versucht zu verstehen, warum du gegangen bist, und jetzt bist du einfach, [overwhelmed], hier und bedienst Kameraequipment, als wäre nichts gewesen. [voice breaks]
435. [remorseful] Jeden einzelnen Tag wollte ich mich, [heavy], melden, aber ich wusste nicht, ob du von jemandem hören willst, die, [ashamed], weggegangen ist, als du sie am meisten gebraucht hast. [sighs]
Character 1: [raw] Mama sagte, du bist gegangen, weil die, [bitter], Verantwortung zu viel war, aber dich hier zu sehen, wie du Equipment im Millionenwert bedienst, lässt diese, [sarcastic], Ausrede ziemlich hohl klingen. [laughs bitterly]
436. Also, ähm, die Wahrheit ist, ich meine, [painful], ich bin gegangen, weil ich nicht wusste, wie ich die Mutter sein sollte, die du verdient hast.
Character 1: Das ist so eine, [frustrated], billige Ausrede und du weißt es. [angry]
437. [pleading] Ich war 22 und, ähm, hatte Angst und deine Mutter hatte ihre, [remembering], Familie, die ihr half, während ich, na ja, nichts hatte außer meiner eigenen kaputten Kindheit als, [vulnerable], Vorlage. [tears up]
Character 1: [softening] Ich hab mir jeden Film mit, [wistful], Oberbeleuchter im Abspann angeschaut und gehofft, vielleicht deinen Namen irgendwo zu sehen.
438. Ich hab dein Babyfoto in jedem, [tender], Equipmentkoffer, den ich besitze. [pause]
Character 1: [wavering] Also, ähm, ich meine, wir haben noch sechs Wochen bei dieser, [uncertain], Produktion und ich muss wissen, ob du, [searching], vorhast wieder zu verschwinden, wenn es vorbei ist, oder, na ja, ob wir vielleicht, [hopeful], versuchen könnten, das hier irgendwie hinzukriegen. [long pause]
439. [determined] Ich gehe, [firm], nirgendwohin, außer du sagst mir, ich soll gehen.
Character 1: [relieved] Vielleicht könnten wir einfach mit, [tentative], Kaffee nach dem Dreh morgen anfangen und schauen, ob wir in diesem ganzen Chaos etwas finden, was sich, [cautious], retten lässt.
440. [grateful] Ich würde mir wirklich, [emotional], nichts mehr wünschen als diese Chance. [sniffles]
Character 1: I recognized that scar on your hand [trembling] when you were filling out the form, the one from when [voice breaking] we built that treehouse and you [quietly] cut yourself on dad's saw.
441. [stunned] I, um, I don't know what you're, well, [shaking] I changed my name for a reason and, uh, [defensive] I never thought anyone from back then would find me here.
Character 1: [desperate] Mom cried for, um, three years straight after you left, and like, [choking up] dad never spoke your name again but I'd catch him, well, [broken] staring at your empty chair every dinner. [sobs quietly]
442. They made their choice when they [bitter] said I was dead to them for loving who I loved, so I, um, [hollow] became someone else entirely and, well, [detached] built my life page by page like the books I bind. [long pause]
Character 1: [pleading] But I never, um, I mean I never said those things, I was just [anguished] seventeen and scared and didn't know how to, well, [regretful] stand up to them when they threw you out like that.
443. [barely audible] You didn't stop them. [exhales]
Character 1: [crying] I've been looking for you for twelve years, checking [desperate] every phone book and social media platform imaginable.
444. [defensive] The person you're looking for doesn't [coldly] exist anymore, can't you understand that?
Character 1: But you're sitting right here in [breaking] my massage room, and I can still see the way you [voice cracking] bite your lip when you're nervous just like when we were kids.
445. [wavering] Um, don't do this.
Character 1: [whispered] Well, I, uh, can't not.
446. [resigned] You have no idea what it cost me to [heavy] become someone dad couldn't destroy with his disappointment. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: Dad died two years [choked] ago calling out for you in his hospital bed, begging the [tearful] universe for one more chance to make things right with his child.
447. [shocked] He never, um, I mean he never even acknowledged I was, well, [crumbling] his child after that night, so why would he, uh, [confused] call for someone he said was dead? [voice breaks]
Character 1: [gentle] Because parents make terrible mistakes when [sad] they're afraid, and he spent his last years [remorseful] drowning in the weight of what he'd done.
448. It doesn't change what happened or [angry] bring back the years I spent alone, wondering if I was [defeated] worth loving at all.
Character 1: I know it doesn't, but [soft] maybe we could start over from here. [hopeful pause]
449. [exhausted] I've been coming here for, um, six months for my back pain, and you're telling me you knew, well, [incredulous] who I was this whole time and just, uh, [hurt] kept working on me like nothing had happened? [silence]
Character 1: [ashamed] I kept, um, trying to find the right moment but, well, [struggling] every week you'd leave and I'd hate myself a little more.
450. [sinking] Maybe there was never going to be a [defeated] right moment for something this broken.
Character 1: [steady] Vor 5 Jahren ist eure Chemiefabrik explodiert, [bitter], weil ihr bei den Sicherheitskosten gespart habt, und meine Frau und Tochter waren, [breaking], direkt daneben als das ganze Ding zusammengebrochen ist.
451. [defensive] Dieser Vorfall wurde gründlich untersucht und wir wurden, [uncomfortable], von 3 separaten Aufsichtsbehörden von jeder kriminellen Fahrlässigkeit freigesprochen und, [quieter], haben alle Vergleiche bezahlt. [exhales sharply]
Character 1: [cold] Ihr habt Vergleiche bezahlt damit es verschwindet aber, [melancholic], nie wirklich zugegeben was ihr getan habt oder irgendetwas daran geändert wie, [accusatory], eure Portfoliounternehmen arbeiten.
452. Die Rechtsabteilung hat das alles geregelt und ehrlich gesagt überwache ich nicht persönlich, [dismissive], jede operative Entscheidung in jeder Firma in die wir investieren.
Character 1: Also, ähm, ich habe 3 Jahre damit verbracht jeden beteiligten Manager aufzuspüren, ich meine, [dark], genau zu planen was ich mit jedem von euch machen würde.
453. [alarmed] Soll das irgendeine Art von, [nervous], Drohung sein, because I can have security here immediately.
Character 1: [resigned] Nein, ich habe diesen Weg aufgegeben und jetzt bin ich hier und bitte um, [ironic], Finanzierung für eine Opferhilfsorganisation stattdessen.
454. [shocked] Warte mal, ähm, du bist diejenige die diesen Vorschlag geschickt hat über, äh, [confused], Hilfe für Familien die von Unternehmensfahrlässigkeit betroffen sind, ich meine, das warst du?
Character 1: [firm] Ja also, ähm, ich dachte mir die beste Rache wäre dich zu zwingen, [determined], mir in die Augen zu sehen und entweder zu helfen das zu reparieren was ihr zerstört habt oder, äh, zuzugeben dass es euch eigentlich egal ist.
455. [conflicted] Ich, ähm, ich erinnere mich tatsächlich an diesen Tag weil meine Tochter eigentlich, also, [voice dropping], genau an diesem Ort für einen Schulausflug sein sollte aber an diesem Morgen krank wurde.
Character 1: [stunned] Deine Tochter war fast dort und du hast trotzdem, [furious], alles vertuscht und so getan als hätte nichts verhindert werden können?
456. [guilty] Schau, äh, die Versicherungen und Anwälte haben sofort übernommen und ich meine, [struggling], we weren't allowed to admit anything that could increase liability.
Character 1: [exhausted] Weißt du wie es ist Leichen zu identifizieren die so schlimm verbrannt sind dass, ähm, [choking up], man sie nur an einem Ehering erkennen kann oder, also, einem Kinderarmband?
457. [broken] Jesus Christus, ich hatte keine Ahnung dass es so, [horrified], schlimm war, because they kept all those details out of the reports we saw, und ehrlich gesagt wollte ich, [crumbling], nie die wahren menschlichen Kosten wissen. [voice cracking]
Character 1: [quiet] Ich meine, jede Nacht rieche ich immer noch den Rauch und höre die Schreie und, ähm, frage mich warum ich nicht da war um sie zu beschützen.
458. Die Finanzierung die du verlangst ist, [calculating], erheblich aber ich könnte es als Social Impact Investment strukturieren.
Character 1: Mach das nicht zu einer Sache von Steuervergünstigungen oder guter PR, this is about actually preventing other families from going through what I went through.
459. [resolved] Du hast recht und ich werde es voll finanzieren, [sincere], nicht als Investment sondern als das was es wirklich ist. [pauses heavily]
Character 1: [disbelieving] Nach allem, ähm, ich weiß nicht ob ich tatsächlich Geld von der Person nehmen kann die, äh, [struggling], meine ganze Welt zerstört hat, even if it means helping others.
460. [melancholic] Dann lass mich alles direkt auf dich überschreiben ohne jegliche Bedingungen, because maybe funding your mission is the only way I can live with what we allowed to happen. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [nervous] Ähm, also, ich muss dir—
461. [concerned] Du kommst nie so spät zur Gießerei, außer es ist was, [wary], schief gelaufen, also sag mir einfach, was los ist, weil dein Gesichtsausdruck, [anxious], mir den Magen umdreht.
Character 3: [breathless] Ich hab das Stipendium bekommen, ähm, das in Stockholm, für das ich letztes Jahr beworben hatte, na ja, [trembling], das wir beide für unmöglich hielten und, halt, [quiet], nie wieder erwähnt haben nach der Absage.
462. [stunned] Stockholm ist, ähm, 6000 Kilometer von dieser Gießerei entfernt, ich meine, [hollow], von allem, was wir hier in dieser Stadt aufgebaut haben, wo meine Familie schon seit, na ja, [trailing off], drei Generationen Metall verarbeitet.
Character 1: [desperate] Ich weiß, was dieser Ort für dich bedeutet und wie das, [anguished], flüssige Stahl durch deine Adern fließt, genau wie bei deinem Großvater, aber diese Gelegenheit, [pleading], dafür arbeite ich, seit ich, [whispered], 22 bin.
463. Die Hitze dieser Öfen war meine, [bitter], ständige Begleiterin seit 15 Jahren und jetzt verlangst du von mir, sie gegen, [defeated], skandinavische Winter und eine Sprache einzutauschen, die ich nicht spreche.
Character 1: [defensive] Ich verlange nicht, dass du, ähm, irgendwas eintauschst, ich meine, [frustrated], ich erzähle dir von einer Chance, die unser Leben verändern könnte und, na ja, [softer], uns vielleicht die Zukunft gibt, über die wir immer geredet haben.
464. [angry] Unsere Zukunft sollte hier sein, wo ich, [gesturing wildly], zu Fuß zur Arbeit gehen und rußbedeckt heimkommen kann, um dich in diesem Sessel am Fenster lesen zu sehen, [voice breaking], nicht am anderen Ende der Welt, während du, [quieter], Träumen nachjagst.
Character 1: [tearful] Also, ähm, soll ich einfach, [choked up], hierbleiben und zusehen, wie meine Ambitionen wie altes Metall verrosten?
465. [exhausted] Deine Ambitionen rosten nicht, sie, ähm, [resigned], führen dich nur weg von jemandem, der ihr ganzes Leben darauf ausgerichtet hat, na ja, [broken], dich zu lieben.
Character 1: [whispered] Na ja, ähm, ich weiß.
466. [gentle] Jedes Stück, das ich schmiede, erinnert mich daran, wie wir sein sollten, [tender], formbar genug, um uns zu biegen, ohne zu brechen.
Character 1: [hopeful] Vielleicht ist das unsere Chance, ähm, diese Theorie zu beweisen, weil, ich meine, [warming], echter Stahl wird stärker, wenn er durch Feuer und, na ja, [emotional], Entfernung geprüft wird.
467. [contemplating] Mein Großvater sagte immer, dass die besten Legierungen, ähm, [thoughtful], aus der Verbindung verschiedener Metalle unter extremem Druck und Hitze entstehen, also vielleicht, na ja, [softening], ist das einfach unser Schmelztiegel-Moment. [sighs]
Character 1: Das Stipendium geht über, ähm, 2 Jahre, was sich wie, [overwhelmed], eine Ewigkeit anfühlt, aber es ist nicht für immer und ich meine, [steady], wir haben deine Doppelschichten und mein endloses Lernen überlebt, also schaffen wir vielleicht auch, [determined], die Entfernung.
468. [reluctant] Zwei Jahre Videoanrufe, wo ich nicht, [pained], dein Shampoo riechen oder deine kalten Füße an meinen im Bett spüren kann, [struggling], zusehen, wie du dir ein Leben aufbaust an einem Ort, wo ich nur eine, [whispered], Besucherin bin. [pause]
Character 1: [firm] Du wärst keine Besucherin, denn wo immer ich hingehe, [intense], bist du schon da in jeder Entscheidung, die ich treffe.
469. [surprised] Wenn du es so sagst, klingt es fast, [considering], machbar, obwohl meine Hände buchstäblich durch Generationen von, [wistful], Tradition und Muskelgedächtnis an diesen Ort geschweißt sind.
Character 1: [eager] Deine Hände könnten, ähm, neue Dinge lernen, weil, na ja, [excited], schwedischer Stahl ist legendär.
470. [resolute] Wenn wir das wirklich durchziehen, dann muss ich es, ähm, [determined], morgen meinem Vater sagen, bevor er es von jemand anderem in der Gießerei hört, weil, ich meine, [nervous], Neuigkeiten verbreiten sich hier schneller als flüssiges Metall und, na ja, [breathing deeply], er hat es verdient, es von mir zu hören.
Character 1: [weary] Ich habe 17 Berichte geschickt, die vor genau diesen strukturellen Schwächen gewarnt haben, [bitter], vor dem Einsturz, und jeder einzelne wurde, [breaking], von Bürokraten begraben, die meinten, ich würde übertreiben.
471. [quiet] Ja, ich, ähm, erinnere mich daran, diese Berichte gelesen zu haben, nachdem, nun ja, [hollow], nachdem meine Produzentin hier unten gestorben ist, als sie versuchte, ähm, the story nobody wanted to hear zu bekommen. [exhales]
Character 1: [defensive] Also willst du jetzt, ähm, 5 Jahre später ein Interview mit mir, wenn, [angry], plötzlich alle sich dafür interessieren, weil es, nun ja, another tunnel showing the same signs gibt? [laughs bitterly]
472. Schau, ich meine, ich bin heute nicht als Journalistin hier, [trembling], ich bin hier, weil ich, ähm, jede Woche durch diesen Tunnel gehe, nur um, nun ja, mich an sie zu erinnern.
Character 1: [stunned] Du kommst hierher?
473. [struggling] Jeden Donnerstag um, ähm, 15:47 Uhr, genau zu der Zeit, als, [voice cracking], die Decke herunterkam und ich, nun ja, everything that mattered to me verloren habe.
Character 1: [exhausted] Ich inspiziere diesen Tunnel jetzt zweimal im Monat, und, ähm, jedes Mal wenn ich dieselben Spannungsrisse entstehen sehe, nun ja, [haunted], höre ich die Schreie von jenem Tag von diesen Wänden widerhallen. [long pause]
474. [barely audible] Ich auch.
Character 1: Die Stadt hört jetzt endlich auf meine Berichte, aber ähm, nur weil 23 Menschen gestorben sind und bewiesen haben, dass ich, [bitter], die ganze Zeit recht hatte, und ich meine, that's not vindication at all, es ist einfach, nun ja, Folter.
475. [firm] Hör auf damit.
Character 1: [frustrated] Womit genau aufhören—aufhören mich, [anguished], schuldig zu fühlen, dass ich nicht lauter geschrien habe, oder aufhören, ihre Gesichter zu sehen, every time I close my eyes?
476. Sarah hätte es, ähm, gehasst, dich so zu sehen, ich meine, [gentle], sie sagte immer, du wärst die einzige Inspektorin, die wirklich, nun ja, einen Dreck darauf gab, Menschen zu schützen. [sighs]
Character 1: Du kanntest Sarah, [shocked], persönlich?
477. [trembling] Sie war, ähm, 6 Jahre lang meine Partnerin und wir wollten, [choking up], in jenem Sommer heiraten, aber ich habe es nie, nun ja, [broken], jemandem beim Sender erzählt, because we wanted to keep it private. [crying softly]
Character 1: [whispered] Oh Gott, ähm, es tut mir so leid, ich meine, ich wusste nicht, dass sie, nun ja, dass ihr beide—
478. [resolved] Sie starb, [steady], beim Versuch Menschen zu evakuieren, weil sie deinen Berichten glaubte, when nobody else would listen.
Character 1: Deshalb bist du wirklich hier, nicht wegen einer Story, sondern, [understanding], weil du wissen musst, ob ich etwas gefunden habe, that could prevent this from happening again, irgendwo anders.
479. [desperate] Bitte, ähm, sag es mir einfach.
Character 1: [heavy] Nun ja, ähm, ja.
480. [determined] Dann kämpfen wir.

Character 1: [stunned] Mom?
481. I didn't know you worked here, [uncomfortable], ich brauchte nur etwas, [swallowing], Obst für das Kirchenkonzert morgen, also, [trailing off], das ist unerwartet.
Character 1: [shaking] Well, I've been working here for 3 years now, [hollow], und das ist das erste Mal, dass du durch diese Türen gekommen bist.
482. [measured] The cathedral commissioned a new organ, [careful], und sie haben mich vor 6 Monaten zurück in die Stadt versetzt, aber ich war mir nicht sicher, ob, [hesitant], Kontakt aufzunehmen willkommen wäre.
Character 1: 6 months and you never thought to call? [bitter], Kein Brief, gar nichts?
483. [quietly] Every single day. [long pause]
Character 1: The produce section isn't exactly where reunions happen, [sardonic], aber hier sind wir nach, [voice breaking], 15 Jahren von nichts. [exhales]
484. [gentle] I know this isn't ideal, [emotional], aber dich hier zu sehen, gesund und arbeitend, es ist, na ja, es ist mehr als ich, [grateful], nach allem was passiert ist erhofft hatte. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: You left when dad got sick, [accusatory], und bist nie zurückgekommen, nicht mal zur Beerdigung, nicht mal um, [breaking], mir zu helfen herauszufinden was ich tun soll. [trembles]
485. [remorseful] Building organs became my escape, [ashamed], meine Art mit der Trauer umzugehen, und als ich realisierte was ich, [pained], verloren hatte, fühlte es sich zu spät an zurückzukommen.
Character 1: [softer] You know, I still have that little wooden pipe, [wavering], die du für mich geschnitzt hast, und manchmal halte ich sie und erinnere mich daran, als du mich, [wistful], in deiner Werkstatt hast helfen lassen.
486. [hopeful] Well, the cathedral organ needs constant maintenance, [careful], und ich könnte eine Assistentin gebrauchen, wenn du jemals lernen möchtest.
Character 1: [uncertain] I don't know, that's a lot to process, [struggling], nach all dieser Zeit, weißt du?
487. I understand completely. [pause]
Character 1: [warming] These apples are perfect for tomorrow's concert, [professional], und wir haben heute Morgen frische Birnen bekommen, die, [softer], wunderbar dazu passen würden.
488. [grateful] That's very kind of you to suggest, [touched], und vielleicht könnten wir, [hopeful], mehr reden während du mir hilfst sie auszuwählen?
Character 1: [thoughtful] You know, dad always said that, [emotional], Vergebung wächst langsam wie gutes Obst am Baum.
489. [tearful] He was right about so many things, [regretful], und ich hätte mehr auf ihn hören sollen, besonders darüber, [voice breaking], was wirklich im Leben zählt. [choked up]
Character 1: [decided] Tomorrow's concert starts at 7, [tentative], und vielleicht, wenn du möchtest, könnten wir danach Kaffee trinken und, [warming], wirklich über diese 15 Jahre sprechen. [exhales slowly]
490. [relieved] I'd like that more than you know, [genuine], meine Tochter.
491. [gasp] Drei? Hast du gerade gesagt—ich meine, das kann doch nicht... [shaky voice] Moment, willst du mir wirklich sagen, dass drei unserer Leute... wegen Entscheidungen, die ich getroffen habe? [pause] Oh Gott. Ähm, ich muss—ich muss mich kurz hinsetzen. [very quietly] Ihre Namen, wie hießen sie... ach nein, ich kenne ihre Namen ja. Sarah aus der Buchhaltung, sie war gerade mal 26. Und Marcus, der hatte doch diese Zwillinge, oder? [crying while speaking] Die Umstrukturierung, das war meine Idee. Die Überstunden-Pflicht, dafür hab ich mich stark gemacht. Ich dachte halt, wir wären effizient, verstehst du? [long pause]

[whispering] Wie konnte ich das nicht sehen? Ich meine, die Anzeichen müssen doch—Gott, die Sache ist, ich saß wortwörtlich in Meetings und hab über Produktivitätskennzahlen geredet, während diese Menschen... [sniffle] Sie sind untergegangen und ich hab, was, auf Tabellen gestarrt? [very sad] Jede einzelne Entscheidung, ich schwöre, ich dachte, ich würde—aber das ist jetzt auch egal, oder? Drei Familien zerstört, weil ich die Quartalsziele erreichen wollte. [regretful] Ehrlich, wie soll man damit... wie soll ich damit leben? Mit dem Wissen, dass sie noch da wären, wenn ich einfach, keine Ahnung, auf echte Menschen geachtet hätte statt auf Zahlen? [upset] Sie wären noch da.
492. [gasp loudly] Oh mein Gott, das war—das Kind wäre beinah von den Einkaufswagen zerquetscht worden! [shaky voice] Ich hab das wie in Zeitlupe ablaufen sehen, weißt du? Die ganze Reihe rollte direkt auf ihn zu und ich war wie gelähmt, ich konnte nicht mal—meine Stimme hat versagt. [relieved] Aber der Mitarbeiter, der ist einfach hingesprungen, regelrecht hingehechtet und hat das Kind gepackt, es weggerissen, so... ähm... eine halbe Sekunde vor dem Aufprall.

[pause]

Die Mutter hat überhaupt nichts mitbekommen, sie hat auf ihr Handy gestarrt und plötzlich war ihr Kind in den Armen von diesem Typen und 20 Metallwagen sind da in die Wand gekracht, wo er gerade noch gestanden hatte. [very sincerely] Ich meine, das wäre... Gott, ich will gar nicht dran denken. [grateful] Der Mitarbeiter hat dem kleinen Jungen das Leben gerettet, keine Frage. Also, er hat nicht mal eine Sekunde gezögert, reiner Instinkt.

[emotional] Und wie er dann das Kind einfach so der Mutter zurückgegeben hat, ganz lässig, als wär's nichts gewesen? [laugh] Der verdient wahrscheinlich Mindestlohn und hat einfach... [trailing off] Ich hätte nach seinem Namen fragen sollen. Weißt du was, ich geh jetzt einen Manager suchen und sorg dafür, dass die erfahren, was er getan hat. [determined] Da arbeitet ein echter Held auf ihrem Parkplatz.
493. [confused] Warte, dieser Name auf dem—nein, das kann doch nicht... [gasp] Oh mein Gott. [pause] Tommy? Tommy Chen aus, aus der dritten Klasse? [anxious] Ich schaue gerade auf seine Unterschrift hier auf den Gründungsdokumenten und ich—Scheiße, das ist seine Firma. [laugh] Der mit dem, ähm, dem kleinen Tech-Startup, das diese—[trailing off] [long pause] Wir haben früher diese verrückten Roboter-Dinger in seiner Garage gebaut, weißt du noch? Seine Mutter hat uns immer diese... [warm] diese unglaublichen Teigtaschen gemacht. [bitter] Und jetzt sitze ich hier mit einer scheiß Tabelle und rechne aus, wie viel wir verdienen, wenn wir sein Lebenswerk zerstören. [frustrated] Ich mein, ist doch nur Geschäft, oder? [hesitantly] Das ist, was wir machen. Wir finden die Ineffizienzen, wir verschlanken, wir— [very quietly] wir machen Sachen kaputt. [regretful] Gott, er weiß es wahrscheinlich noch nicht mal. Morgen früh kriegt er den Anruf und... [shaky voice] Hör mal, ich wusste—ich wusste nicht, dass es seine ist, okay? Der Name war anders, es war nur eine weitere Akte auf meinem Schreibtisch. [angry] Aber das spielt keine Rolle, oder? Weil ich es trotzdem machen werde. [whispering] Ich muss. [very sad] Zwanzig Jahre, seit wir das letzte Mal gesprochen haben und so—[sniffle] so sage ich wieder Hallo.
494. [relieved] Weißt du, als ich die Zahlen zum ersten Mal durchgerechnet habe—ehrlich, ich konnte es nicht glauben. 40 Prozent Reduzierung der Umweltbelastung. Also, [pause] ich hab die Berechnungen immer wieder überprüft, weil, ähm, das schien unmöglich für eine Kunststofffabrik.

[excited] Ich meine, wir reden hier von echter Veränderung! Die Sache ist, [slowly] alle gehen immer davon aus, dass Kunststoffproduktion dieser, na ja, Umwelt-Albtraum sein muss. Aber ich habe bewiesen—na ja, [proud] wir haben das Gegenteil bewiesen.

[hesitantly] Obwohl ehrlich gesagt, manchmal frage ich mich immer noch, ob es genug ist. Also klar, 40 Prozent ist riesig, [sigh] aber wir stellen immer noch Plastik her, oder? Meine Schwester, die macht mir immer—[frustrated] Gott, sie macht mir so einen Stress deswegen. "Du machst das Problem nur weniger schlimm," sagt sie. [bitter] Danke, wirklich hilfreich.

[warming up] Aber dann denke ich an, ähm, die Tonnen von Emissionen, die wir jetzt nicht mehr freisetzen. Das Wasser, das wir nicht verschmutzen. Und also, [passionately] irgendjemand muss diese Arbeit machen! We can't just pretend plastics don't exist while we're still using them for literally everything.

[very quietly] Vielleicht versuche ich es nur mir selbst zu rechtfertigen. [pause] Oder vielleicht, [confidently] vielleicht passiert Veränderung genau so—eine Effizienzverbesserung nach der anderen.
495. [gasp softly] Ich mache es. Ich mache es wirklich—oh mein Gott, [extremely happy] schau dir meine Füße an! Sie bewegen sich, sie bewegen sich echt! [crying while speaking] Die Ärzte haben gesagt—sie haben mir direkt ins Gesicht gesagt, ich würde nie wieder... [pause] Und hier bin ich, verstehst du?

[laugh] 3 Schritte. Das sind 3 ganze Schritte! Also, meine Beine fühlen sich an wie Wackelpudding, aber wen kümmert's? [shaky voice] Weißt du noch, als Dr. Morrison sagte, die Nervenschäden wären permanent? Dass ich meine, ähm, "Erwartungen anpassen" sollte? Na ja, [bitter] wo ist er jetzt, hm?

[very excited] Siehst du das? Schaust du zu? Weil ich brauche—ich brauche jemanden, der das bezeugt! [gasp loudly] Warte, ich versuch's nochmal. Hier, nur... [hesitantly] okay, mein linkes Bein ist ziemlich wackelig, aber es—[relieved] es hält mich aufrecht!

[cry] Ich dachte, ich hätte es akzeptiert, weißt du? Den Rollstuhl, das alles. Aber irgendwie hab ich halt... ich weiß nicht, ich hab einfach diese Übungen weitergemacht, die du mir gezeigt hast. [warm] Jeden einzelnen Tag, auch wenn es sinnlos schien. Und jetzt—[laugh loudly] jetzt laufe ich! Ich laufe wirklich! [whispering] Danke. Dass du mich nicht aufgegeben hast, als buchstäblich alle anderen es taten.
496. [gasp] Warte, bist du—meinst du das gerade ernst? Du willst, dass ich die Patentante werde? [very excited] Oh mein Gott, Sarah, ich kann gar nicht—das ist so krass! Ich meine, wir reden hier von deinem Baby. [pause] Deinem echten winzigen Menschen, den du großziehen wirst und... [emotional] Sorry, ich werde gerade total komisch, aber ehrlich, ich hätte nicht erwartet—ich dachte, du fragst vielleicht deine Schwester oder, ähm, keine Ahnung, jemand Vernünftigeres? [laugh] Weißt du noch, als ich die Sukkulente umgebracht habe, die du mir geschenkt hast? Zweimal! [warm] Aber du fragst mich wirklich, so ein Teil ihres Lebens zu sein, bei all den großen Momenten und den kleinen dabei zu sein und... [sniffle] Gott, warum heule ich jetzt? Das ist so peinlich. [happy] Ja! Natürlich ja, ich sage ja! Ich bin nur—wow, ich darf die coole Patentante sein, die das Kind total verwöhnt, oder? Das ist doch praktisch die Jobbeschreibung? [sincerely] Sarah, ich verspreche dir, ich werde dieses Kind so unfassbar lieben. Also, es wird wissen, dass es jemanden hat, der immer, immer für es da sein wird. [cry] Okay, jetzt heulst du auch und wir sind beide ein Wrack! Komm her, komm in meine Arme. Das ist das Schönste, worum mich je jemand gebeten hat.
497. Three point seven million dollars. That's what Uncle Richard left me. [confused] The same Uncle Richard who forgot my birthdays, who told me I'd never amount to anything, who—[bitter] who couldn't even look me in the eye at family dinners. [short pause] I keep reading the will, like maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

[angry] Twenty-three years of nothing, and now this? I mean, what am I supposed to feel here? [sarcastic] Grateful? To a man who made me feel invisible my entire childhood? [laughing] God, this is so messed up. 

[quietly] Mom says he was proud of me. [frustrated] Well, where was that pride when I graduated? Where was it when I needed—[trailing off] whatever. [sigh] 

The lawyer keeps calling it a "generous bequest." [mocking] Generous. Right. Like money fixes everything. [pause] Though honestly, it does fix the student loans. And the medical bills. And—[hesitantly] shit, am I actually considering this?

[very sad] You know what the worst part is? Um, I would've traded every penny just to hear him say he cared. Once. [sniffle] Just once would've been enough. [bitterly] But no, he had to wait until he was dead to acknowledge I existed. 

[exhausted] Classic Uncle Richard. Still controlling everything from the grave.
498. [nervous] Also, ähm, ich hab die Beförderung bekommen. Anlagenführerin. Ja. [pause] Das Gehalt ist, also, es ist wirklich gut—so vierzig Prozent mehr als jetzt. [bitter] Und weißt du, was das Ding ist? Ich weiß genau, was wir herstellen. Ich weiß genau, was aus diesen Pellets wird. Flaschen, die dann, na ja, [regretful] im Meer landen oder so. Mikroplastik im—egal. [frustrated] Aber meine Kinder brauchen, äh, sie brauchen halt Sachen, okay? Das Studium wird nicht billiger. [defensive] Und ist ja nicht so, dass die Anlage plötzlich stillsteht, wenn ich's nicht mache, oder? [laugh] Dann macht's halt eine andere—das sag ich mir jedenfalls immer wieder. [sad] Meine Tochter, sie, äh, sie studiert Umweltwissenschaften. [pause] Ist das nicht einfach... [trailing off] Gott. [quietly] Ich hab's ihr noch nicht gesagt. Von der Beförderung. [anxious] Sie schickt mir ständig diese Artikel über, na ja, den Plastikstrudel im Pazifik und ehrlich gesagt, ich kann einfach nicht—[groan] Ich lese sie. Jeden einzelnen. [shaky voice] Und dann geh ich zur Arbeit und produziere noch mehr davon. [bitter] Aber die Krankenversicherung übernimmt jetzt Therapie, also das ist... [laugh] das ist ja schon mal was. [very quietly] Noch zwanzig Jahre bis zur Rente. [sigh] Noch zwanzig Jahre.
499. [anxious] God, okay so, when I heard that engine sputter through the radio—I mean, that's a frozen fuel line if I've ever heard one. And honestly, with kids out there? In this weather? [quickly] I grabbed every tool I had, like, literally threw them in the sled because the thing is, you know, hypothermia sets in fast. Really fast.

[focused] Their Arctic Cat was just... dead. Completely seized. And the dad, he's looking at me like—well, anyway, I could see the panic. [reassuring] "Hey, it's okay," I told him, "I've basically rebuilt a hundred of these." Which, um, wasn't exactly a lie. Sort of.

[determined] So I'm lying in the snow, right? My hands are, er, completely numb, but I managed to bypass the—actually, you know what? [excited] The fuel pump relay, that's what saved them! I jerry-rigged it with, I guess, some wire from my emergency kit. 

[relieved] And then—oh God—when that engine finally turned over? [emotional] The little girl, she just... she started crying. Happy tears though. Her lips were literally blue before we got them moving. [pause] I mean, thirty more minutes out there and... [trailing off]

[warm] Anyway, they're safe. That's what matters. [chuckle] The dad tried to pay me, but honestly? Seeing them drive away alive was, you know... that was enough.
500. [gasp loudly] Sie will, dass ich ihre Trauzeugin werde? Nach—nach drei Jahren Funkstille? [confused] Ich meine, wir haben seit Mamas Beerdigung kein richtiges Gespräch mehr geführt, und jetzt ruft sie plötzlich an, so nach dem Motto, [mocking] "Hey, erinnerst du dich noch an mich? Deine Schwester?" [bitter] Und ich soll jetzt einfach... was, so tun als wäre alles in Ordnung?

[pause]

[shaky voice] Die Sache ist die, ähm, ich hab tatsächlich angefangen zu weinen, als sie gefragt hat. [sniffle] Nicht weil ich glücklich war—na ja, vielleicht ein bisschen—aber weil es sich so... [trailing off] keine Ahnung. [frustrated] Es ist halt so, als ob sie denkt, 'ne Hochzeitseinladung löscht alles aus, weißte? Die vergessenen Geburtstage, die—die komplette Funkstille, als Papa krank wurde. [angry] Sie hat nicht mal auf meine Nachrichten geantwortet!

[long pause]

[sadly] Aber dann hat sie gesagt, dass es ihr leidtut. [whispering] Wirklich leidtut. Und dass sie sich zu sehr geschämt hat, sich zu melden, aber beim Planen der Hochzeit ist ihr klar geworden... [speeding up] sie meinte, sie könnte sich nicht vorstellen, das ohne mich zu machen, dass es sich nicht richtig anfühlen würde, und ehrlich gesagt hab ich einfach— [cry] Mir fehlt es, eine Schwester zu haben. [very quietly] Sie fehlt mir wirklich, wirklich sehr.

[sigh]

[hesitantly] Also hab ich ja gesagt. [nervous laugh] Gott steh mir bei, ich hab ja gesagt. Vielleicht bin ich ja bescheuert, aber... [warm] vielleicht ist das unsere Chance, oder? [hopeful] Vielleicht können Hochzeiten wirklich was kitten.
501. Die Ergebnisse sind da. Endlich die DNA aus dem Labor zurück und, ähm, [relieved] es ist genau das, was wir brauchten—perfekte Übereinstimmung, um zu beweisen, dass Marcus nicht beim Überfall war. [pause] Ich meine, seine DNA ist nirgends am Tatort, also das ist—das sind doch gute Nachrichten, oder? [nervous] Aber hier ist die Sache, äh, als ich die Probe durch die Datenbank hab laufen lassen, halt, weißt du, Sorgfaltspflicht... [long pause]

[whispering] Oh Gott. Da gibt's eine Übereinstimmung mit einem ungelösten Fall von 2019. [anxious] Ich schau mir das an und denk mir—wie ist das überhaupt möglich? Das Blut an dem zerbrochenen Fenster vom Harrison-Überfall, es ist, äh, [shaky voice] es ist hundertprozentig Marcus. [frustrated] Ich meine, was soll ich denn damit machen? Ehrlich, ich starre seit 20 Minuten auf diese Ergebnisse und ich—[trailing off]

[angry] Er hat dagesessen, okay, er hat dagesessen und mir geschworen, dass er niemals jemanden verletzt hätte. [bitter] "Ich bin unschuldig," hat er gesagt. Na ja, technisch gesehen, ja, unschuldig bei DIESEM Verbrechen, aber... [sigh] Die Sache ist, ich muss das melden, oder? [confused] Oder nicht? Nein, nein, natürlich muss ich, es ist nur—[upset] dafür hab ich mich nicht gemeldet. [very quietly] Ich dachte, ich rette einen unschuldigen Mann, und stattdessen bin ich dabei, ähm, [hesitantly] ich zerstöre trotzdem sein Leben. [long pause] Anderes Verbrechen, gleiches Ende.
502. [clearing throat] So this is the vendor portal, um, where you'll be managing all the clinical site contracts. [formal] I've been doing this for eight years, so there's quite a bit to—anyway. [pause] You'll want to check this first thing every morning because the sites in Europe submit their queries overnight. Well, overnight for us. [bitter] Not for you, I guess, since you'll be in... where was it again? Mumbai? 

[sigh] Look, I'm trying to be professional here, but honestly, this is harder than I thought it would be. [shaky voice] Training someone to do the job that I—that was mine. [frustrated] They said it was nothing personal, just "strategic restructuring" or whatever corporate buzzword they're using. 

[slowly] The irony is, like, I built most of these systems myself. [sad] Every spreadsheet, every process flow, every relationship with these clinical sites. And now I have six weeks to basically download my entire brain to you. [laugh] No pressure, right? 

[apologetic] Sorry, I don't mean to make this weird for you. It's not your fault. [exhausted] You seem nice enough, and honestly, you'll probably do fine. [trailing off] The password for the database is... actually, let me just write all of this down.
503. [exhausted] God, I just... I literally just sat there teaching Lily about telling the truth, you know? [bitter] "Always be honest, sweetie. Die Ehrlichkeit ist das Wichtigste." Und die ganze Zeit denke ich an die Lieferung, die ich morgen verschiebe. [short pause] I mean, what else can I do? Ihre Behandlungen sind—Jesus, die kosten 40.000 im Monat. [anxious] Insurance won't cover experimental stuff, also ist es im Grunde... [trailing off]

[sigh] The thing is, um, sie schaut mich mit diesen Augen an, und ich versuche ehrlich nur, sie am Leben zu halten. [crying while speaking] But how do I explain that daddy breaks the law to buy her medicine? [frustrated] Like, "Hey honey, er, manchmal müssen Erwachsene unmögliche Entscheidungen treffen"?

She asked me today—[shaky voice] sie hat mich tatsächlich gefragt, ob ich jemals lüge. And I just... [long pause] I said no. [regretful] Direkt ins Gesicht, ich habe nein gesagt. Because, well, what am I supposed to say? "Ja Schätzchen, Papa schmuggelt Sachen über Grenzen, aber du solltest definitiv immer die Wahrheit sagen"? [very sad]

Maybe when she's older, she'll understand. [whispering] Oder vielleicht wird sie mich dafür hassen, dass ich so eine Heuchlerin bin. [pause] Either way, at least she'll be alive to make that choice.
504. [very excited] Ich hab's geschafft! Ich hab sie tatsächlich—Gott, ich kann's nicht fassen, dass ich sie endlich besiegt hab. All die Jahre, weißt du, all die Jahre, wo sie immer... [bitter] sie hatte immer dieses Grinsen drauf, so, jedes Mal wenn sie gewonnen hat. Und ich stand nur da und dachte mir, ähm, eines Tages. Eines Tages werde ich—na ja, jedenfalls, hier sind wir. [pause]

Aber dann, äh, ist was passiert, womit ich nicht... [confused] sie weint? Also, sie weint wirklich. Nicht diese, äh, falschen Tränen, die sie bei den Trainern abgezogen hat. Echte Tränen. [quietly] Und ehrlich gesagt weiß ich halt nicht, was ich damit anfangen soll.

Ich meine, sollte sich das nicht, [hesitantly], keine Ahnung, besser anfühlen? Ich hab so hart für diesen Moment trainiert—praktisch dafür gelebt. Jeden Morgen, wenn ich an ihre beschissene perfekte Technik gedacht hab, und jetzt... [long pause]

Sie sitzt da einfach, hm, völlig am Boden zerstört. [empathetically] Die Sache ist, ich glaub ich hab nie wirklich drüber nachgedacht, was verlieren für sie bedeutet. Vielleicht hat sie das ja genauso gebraucht wie—nein, eigentlich sogar mehr als ich?

[regretful] Scheiße. Ich wollte sie schlagen, aber nicht... nicht kaputtmachen. Verstehst du? Es ist komisch, ähm, jemanden, den man so lange gehasst hat, einfach... zusammenbrechen zu sehen. [sigh] Da fragt man sich schon, ob, tja, ob das alles überhaupt die Sache wert war.
505. [bitter] Drei Jahre. Drei verdammte Jahre hab ich mich auf diese Stelle vorbereitet. [frustrated] Ich meine, ich hab wortwörtlich das Handbuch geschrieben, das sie jetzt benutzen—der ganze Prozess für die Sozialleistungsanmeldung, das war alles ich. [pause] Und sie geben's dem Derek? [angry] Dem Jungen, der mich letzte Woche gefragt hat, wofür COBRA steht? [laugh] Oh mein Gott, ich kann nicht—[trailing off]

[very loudly] Der kann nicht mal Excel bedienen! [quietly] Ich decke ihn schon seit Monaten, ehrlich gesagt, korrigiere seine Fehler, bevor's jemand merkt. [sarcastic] Aber klar, ja, macht ihn zum Sachbearbeiter für Sozialleistungen. [groan] Weil mit dem Chef verwandt zu sein ist, ähm, offenbar die einzige Qualifikation, die heute noch zählt.

[sad] Weißt du, was das Schlimmste ist? [slowly] Ich dachte echt, meine Arbeit würde für sich sprechen. Also, all die Wochenenden, an denen ich während der Anmeldefristen reingekommen bin, [voice shaking] bis spät geblieben bin, um den Mitarbeitern ihre Optionen zu erklären... [sniffle] Schätze, das zählt alles nichts, wenn du nicht irgendwessen Neffe bist.

[furious] Und Sandra hatte die Frechheit—die absolute Frechheit—mir zu sagen, ich bräuchte mehr "Führungserfahrung." [mocking] Führungserfahrung? [loudly] Ich hab jeden neuen Mitarbeiter in der Abteilung eingearbeitet! [exhausted] Einschließlich dem lieben Derek, der immer noch, [emphatic] immer noch nicht den Unterschied zwischen gesetzlicher und privater Krankenversicherung versteht.

[resigned] Ist auch egal. [pause] Ich aktualisiere heute Abend mein LinkedIn-Profil.
506. Gott, ich kann immer noch nicht glauben, was wir heute gefunden haben. Nur ein ganz normaler Dienstag, weißt du? [casually] Wir gehen die Checkliste durch wie immer—Heizungsraum, Schalttafeln, das Übliche. Dann bleibt Marcus plötzlich stehen und [anxious] er hat diesen Blick im Gesicht. Das Messgerät fängt an verrückt zu spielen, piept ununterbrochen. [gasp] Erdgas. Hohe Konzentration. Right by the main line where it feeds into the building.

Ich meine, wir reden hier von... [shaky voice] 300 Menschen arbeiten in diesem Gebäude. 300. Wenn jemand eine Zigarette angezündet hätte, oder wenn die Heizung falsch angesprungen wäre, oder—actually, I can't even think about it. [pause] Die ganze Nordostecke hätte hochgehen können.

[relieved] Aber wir haben es rechtzeitig entdeckt. That's what matters, right? 20 Minuten früher und wir hätten es komplett verpasst. 20 Minuten später und, naja... [trailing off]

Die Sache ist, ähm, die Leute beschweren sich immer über diese Inspektionen. [frustrated] "Warum braucht ihr schon wieder Zugang? We just did this last month." Aber genau deshalb. [passionately] This is literally why we do what we do! Ein winziger Riss in einer Verschraubung, die wahrscheinlich schon seit Wochen langsam leckt.

[warm] Marcus bekommt eine Auszeichnung, natürlich. Hell, we all should. [chuckle] Wir haben heute tatsächlich Leben gerettet.
507. [bitter] Drei Millionen Series-A-Finanzierung. Drei Millionen Dollar, und ähm, alles woran ich denken kann ist, wie Sarah ihre Sachen gepackt hat, während ich beim Investorenmeeting war. [laugh] Ist das nicht perfekt? [pause] Fünf Jahre auf Bürosofas geschlafen, fünf Jahre lang „nur noch dieser eine Sprint, Schatz" und— [voice breaking] und jetzt will TechCrunch ein Feature machen. [sarcastic] Super Timing, oder? Die Wohnung fühlt sich so... [very quietly] ich erkenn sie ohne ihre Sachen gar nicht wieder. [long pause] Weißt du, was sie gesagt hat? Sie meinte, [mocking] „Glückwunsch, du hast endlich bekommen, was du wolltest." Als ob ich—als ob das von Anfang an mein Plan war. [frustrated] Ich wollte doch beides! Ich dachte, wir bauen gemeinsam etwas auf, aber anscheinend, [sad] hab ich halt alleine gebaut. [sigh] Das Team lässt gerade den Champagner knallen. Derek schickt mir ständig Fotos. [anxious] Ich sollte da sein, ich sollte mitfeiern, aber stattdessen sitze ich hier mit den Scheidungspapieren und dem Term Sheet, und ehrlich? [crying while speaking] Für mich sehen sie gerade genau gleich aus. Einfach nur... Verträge. [exhausted] Der eine ein Anfang, der andere ein Ende. [very melancholic] Vielleicht hatte sie recht. Vielleicht hab ich wirklich genau das bekommen, was ich wollte. [pause] Ich wusste nur nicht, dass es mich alles andere kosten würde.
508. [gasp loudly] Six months? Six fucking months Sarah's been— I mean, I literally just found the receipts in her room. [confused] Wait, so all those times she was like "oh, I don't know what happened to your leftovers," she was just, um, straight up lying to my face? [angry] The hummus, the—the fancy cheese I got for my birthday, those meal prep containers I thought I was going crazy about— [bitter] God, and she'd help me look for them! [mocking] "Maybe you ate it and forgot?" [furious] Are you kidding me right now?

[pause] I actually, like, I genuinely thought I was losing my mind, you know? [frustrated] Started writing sticky notes on everything, and she'd be all, er, sympathetic about it. [sarcastic] "Oh that's so weird, maybe we have mice?" [shouting] MICE, Sarah? Really?

[very quietly] The thing is, if she'd just asked... [trailing off] I mean, honestly, I would've shared. [upset] But it's the lying that's just—ugh, every single time, hmm, pretending to be confused about where stuff went. [shaky voice] Six months of making me doubt myself. 

[exhausted] So now what, right? I can't just, like, pretend I don't know. [sigh] God, rent's due next week too. [very slowly] This is going to be so awkward.
509. [sigh] Also heute haben sie's uns endlich gesagt—das automatische Wagensystem geht nächsten Monat in Betrieb. 23 von uns, einfach... weg. [bitter] Ich mein, ich wusste ja, dass es kommt, wir alle wussten es, aber es dann wirklich zu hören war, ähm, anders. [pause] Mann, 8 Jahre lang Einkaufswagen auf diesem Parkplatz einsammeln. 8 Jahre "Entschuldigung, wo ist die Toilette?" und Autos im Regen ausweichen. [laugh] Aber weißt du was? [slowly] Ich dachte die ganze Zeit, ich wäre am Boden zerstört, das war halt meine Sicherheit, oder? Aber als ich heute in diesem Pausenraum saß, fühlte ich mich eigentlich... [relieved] keine Ahnung, leichter irgendwie?

[excited] Mein Atelier steht da seit 2 Jahren quasi unberührt, weil ich nach der Arbeit immer zu kaputt bin zum Malen. [speeding up] Und jetzt denke ich an all die Leinwände, die ich grundiert aber nie angefangen hab, und diese Auftragsanfrage, die ich letzten Monat abgelehnt hab, und—[gasp softly] ach du meine Güte, ich kann mich jetzt tatsächlich für diese Künstlerresidenz bewerben. [hesitantly] Ich mein, klar, mit dem Geld wird's erstmal eng, aber... [warm] ehrlich? Als sie sagten "dein letzter Tag ist der 30.", war das Erste, was ich mir vorgestellt hab, ich an meiner Staffelei um 10 Uhr morgens an einem Dienstag. [very sincerely] Nicht wie ich hektisch Wagen schiebe, bevor der Laden aufmacht. Einfach nur... malen.
510. [warm] Schau sie dir alle zusammen an. Ich meine, ehrlich gesagt, vor einem Jahr war ich mir nicht—ich war mir nicht sicher, ob wir diesen Tag je erleben würden. [pause] Marcus da drüben mit seinen Kindern, und seine Mutter ist tatsächlich gekommen, was einfach... [happy] Gott, wie sie alle zusammen lachen, weißt du? Als wäre nie was gewesen. [short pause] Dabei ist doch alles passiert, oder? Ich weiß noch, ähm, diese erste Nacht, als er reinkam—praktisch tot, echt blau im Gesicht. [very quietly] Zwei Dosen Narcan. Und dann, äh, drei Wochen später, dasselbe. Seine Mutter, die hat damals nicht mal unsere Anrufe beantwortet. [sniffle] Aber weißt du was, er kam immer wieder zurück, hat's immer wieder versucht. Selbst wenn er rückfällig wurde, tauchte er am nächsten Tag auf, so—keine Ahnung, verlegen, aber immer noch kämpfend. [pause] Und jetzt schau mal. [laughing] Seine Tochter hat ihm gerade diese Papierkrone aufgesetzt, wo "Ein-Jahr-Champion" draufsteht, und er trägt sie tatsächlich! [empathetically] Weißt du, was mich fertigmacht? Dass wir, ähm, so viele verlieren. Aber Marcus—er hat's geschafft. [very sincerely] Sie schaffen's nicht alle, aber dieser hier schon. Und ehrlich, das ist... [trailing off] [cry] Das ist alles, wirklich. Deswegen machen wir das.
Character 1: [hesitantly] Um, I wasn't expecting to see you here today, I mean, after all these years of, [anxious], not knowing where you even were or what happened.
511. Well, um, I know this is, [shaky voice], probably the last thing you expected, but uh, I had to try to reach out somehow, you know?
Character 1: [whispering] Um, uh, why now? [pause]
512. Er, because I've been watching from afar and, [regretful], seeing you in this position, well, it made me realize how much time we've wasted, you know?
Character 1: [very meekly] The palace guards don't even, [confused], know who you really are, do they, because if they did, [trailing off], they would never have let you through the gates like this.
513. [apologetic] No, they think I'm just here to, [nervously], present some luxury goods to the royal household, which technically I am, but obviously that's not, [clearing throat], the real reason. [sigh]
Character 1: [mumbling] I, um, I can't. [long pause]
514. [warm] Look, I know this is, um, [overwhelmed], incredibly difficult and I'm not expecting you to just, [very quietly], forgive everything that happened between us, but maybe we could at least, well, try to talk? [gasp softly]
Character 1: [bitter] You disappeared for twelve years without a single word, [frustrated], and now you show up pretending to sell jewelry to my household staff. [laugh]
515. [empathetically] I understand your anger completely, and um, I know how this must, [sad], look from your perspective, but there were reasons I had to leave, er, reasons I couldn't explain then and, [slowly], maybe still can't fully explain now, you know?
Character 1: [stuttering] B-but, um, why?
516. [sincerely] Because our father made it clear that, well, [upset], only one of us could have the life you're living now, and I, [passionately], couldn't be the reason you lost everything, so um, I chose to disappear instead.
Character 1: You're telling me that all this time, [crying while speaking], I thought you hated me for marrying into royalty, but really you were, [shocked], protecting me from having to choose between family and, [whispering loudly], this life I never even asked for?
517. [very sad] I never hated you, not for a second, and um, [monotone], watching you from the shadows all these years, knowing you thought I abandoned you out of jealousy, well, [speeding up], it's been the hardest thing I've ever had to endure. [cough]
Character 1: [relieved] All those nights I wondered if you were even still alive, [trembling], wondering what I did to make you leave. [sniffle]
518. [friendly] You didn't do anything wrong, ever, and I need you to, [gently], understand that completely before we go any further.
Character 1: The consort's life isn't what people think it is, you know, [melancholic], it's lonely and restrictive and I would have traded it all just to have, [very sincerely], my sibling back in my life.
519. [tearfully] Well, I'm here now, aren't I, and um, [hopeful], maybe it's not too late for us to find some way forward together, even if, er, it has to be in secret like this. [chuckle]
Character 1: [softly] Um, I want to believe we can fix this, but there's so much hurt between us now, and, [exhausted], I don't know if I have the strength to bridge that gap, you know?
520. [determined] Then let me be the one who does the work this time, because, um, [firmly], I've already lost twelve years with you and I won't, well, [loudly], I absolutely won't lose any more time if there's even the smallest chance we can be family again.
Character 1: [hesitantly] I got the call about the Victorian restoration job and, [confused], didn't realize this was your address until I pulled up just now.
521. Well, um, I specifically requested you because, [quietly], I remembered you always talked about wanting to work on, [bitter], authentic period homes and, er, this one needs someone who actually understands the craft.
Character 1: [awkwardly] So, um, are we just going to pretend that, well, the last five years didn't happen? [pause]
522. [coldly] Um, well, yeah. [sigh]
Character 1: I mean, er, I brought the William Morris samples you mentioned in the email and, [slowly], there's also this Arts and Crafts pattern that, well, might work better with the original moldings.
523. [formal] The dining room needs to be finished before my mother visits next month.
Character 1: [frustrated] Well, you know, that's barely three weeks for hand-printed paper installation and, um, the walls need serious prep work first.
524. The previous contractor said it would only take, [dismissive], a week but then disappeared after seeing the plaster damage.
Character 1: [professionally] Um, I mean, authentic restoration isn't like slapping up vinyl from Home Depot—it requires, [firmly], proper moisture barriers and, well, careful pattern matching across every seam. [trailing off]
525. [defensive] Look, um, I wouldn't have called you if there were, well, any other qualified specialists in town who understood, er, Victorian authenticity.
Character 1: So, um, this is purely about my wallpaper skills and not about, [whispering], trying to fix things between us or, well, whatever this awkward energy is right now?
526. [stern] There's nothing to fix because we already, [regretful], established five years ago that we wanted completely different things.
Character 1: [tired] Right, you wanted someone who'd give up their craft to follow your, [mocking], corporate ladder climbing ambitions. [short pause]
527. And you wanted to spend forever working with your hands in, [condescending], old houses that would never pay the bills.
Character 1: [revealing] Well, um, funny thing is I actually own my business now with, [proudly], six employees and more Victorian restoration contracts than, er, I can handle.
528. [surprised] You always said you'd never want the responsibility of managing people or dealing with business paperwork.
Character 1: [warm] Well, turns out that, um, doing what you love makes even the boring parts worthwhile. [chuckle]
529. [melancholic] Meanwhile I'm living alone in this massive house that, [very quietly], echoes every footstep because I chose preservation over, [shaky voice], actual living. [long pause]
Character 1: [empathetically] Maybe that's why you called me.
530. I mean, um, maybe I just needed to see if, well, the walls we put up between us were as permanent as, [trembling], the ones I'm trying to restore in this, er, empty house.
