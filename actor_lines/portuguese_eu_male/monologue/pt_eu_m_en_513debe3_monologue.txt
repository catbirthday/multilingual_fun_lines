Speaker [en]: Another denial letter to write. [exhausted] God, I just—I can't even look at this file anymore, you know? This woman, she's, um, she clearly can't work. I mean, [bitter] the medical records are right here, literally showing she can't stand for more than ten minutes, but somehow... [sigh] Somehow I have to find the technicality that makes her not qualify. [frustrated] It's always something stupid like, oh, she didn't see the right specialist or, er, the paperwork's from four months ago instead of three.

[sad] The thing is, I know what happens next. She'll appeal, obviously, and then, well, [quietly] maybe she'll get a lawyer if she's lucky. Most don't though. Most just... [trailing off] 

[angry] And here's what really gets me—my supervisor literally told me yesterday that our approval rate is "too high." Too high! Like, [sarcastic] sorry for actually reading the files? [pause] I guess I'm supposed to just, what, automatically stamp "denied" on everything?

[very melancholic] I went into this job thinking I'd be helping people. [laugh bitterly] That's the joke, right? Now I'm basically—[shaky voice] I'm the reason someone won't be able to afford their medication next month. [long pause] 

[resigned] Anyway, I'll just... find something wrong with the form. There's always something.
