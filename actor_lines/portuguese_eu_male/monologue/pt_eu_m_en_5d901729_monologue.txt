Speaker [en]: [bitter] Look, I mean, the money's great—honestly, it's never been better. These new people moving in with their, you know, restored brownstones and whatever, they all want authentic chimney sweeps. [laugh] Authentic. Like I'm some kind of artisanal—I don't know, performer or something. But here's the thing, [sad] Mrs. Rodriguez had to move out last month. Forty years she lived next door, and now it's just... gone. [pause] Her whole family, actually. 

So yeah, um, business is booming. [sarcastic] Congratulations to me, right? I've got more clients than I can handle, and they're paying triple what the old neighbors used to. But like—[frustrated] where's Tony's deli? Where's the corner store where Mr. Chen knew everyone's name? Now it's all, er, kombucha bars and—what do they call them—boutique pet spas. 

[very quietly] Sometimes I walk down these streets and I don't even recognize them anymore. And the thing is, [confused] they love me, these new people. They literally take photos of me working, post them online talking about "keeping tradition alive" while they're the ones who—[angry] who pushed out all the actual tradition! [sigh] 

I guess I should be grateful. I mean, the business is set for life now. [regretful] Just wish the neighborhood I built it in was still here.
