Speaker [en]: [hesitantly] Okay, so, um, I don't usually leave notes like this, but I just—I really needed to say something. [sniffle] Today was honestly one of those days where, you know, everything just kind of... falls apart? Like, I got that call this morning about my mom's tests, and then, er, the car wouldn't start, and I—[pause] sorry, I'm rambling. The thing is, when I came through your cart line, and you were just so genuinely [warm] cheerful and kind, it was like—hmm, how do I even explain this? You weren't doing that fake customer service thing. You actually, I mean, you really seemed happy to be there. [smiling speaking] And that little joke you made about the rain? It made me laugh for the first time today. Actually laugh. [very sincerely] I know it's just, well, it's your job or whatever, but the way you treated everyone—not just me—with such, um, genuine warmth? [pause] It reminded me that there's still, you know, goodness in really small moments. So anyway, [chuckle] I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you. For being that bright spot when I really, [empathetically] really needed one.
