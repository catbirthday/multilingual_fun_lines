=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Three years. Three years of my hands on every single stone, and they're... [bitter] they're bringing in bulldozers tomorrow morning. For a parking lot. I keep thinking maybe I heard wrong, but um, no. The notice is right there on the wall I spent six months on—the one with the Celtic knotwork that took me forever to get right. [frustrated] God, do they have any idea what goes into this? 

[pause]

Each stone, I mean, you have to understand its grain, how it wants to break. [very melancholic] There's this one piece near the entrance where I had to work around a natural vein of quartz, and it caught the morning light so perfectly. Now it's gonna be under some guy's Honda Civic. 

[angry] A parking lot! Not even something—I don't know—respectable? [trailing off] Just asphalt and yellow lines and...

My grandfather taught me this trade. [shaky voice] He always said buildings should outlive their makers, that's the whole point. That's why we work in stone, not wood, not steel. Stone endures. [quietly] Supposed to endure, anyway.

[sigh] 

I guess nothing really lasts anymore, does it? Everything's temporary. Even stone. [bitter] Especially when there's money in parking spaces.
