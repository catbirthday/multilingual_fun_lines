Speaker [en]: [relieved] Oh my God, so, I still can't believe what happened today. I mean, I'm just pushing carts around the parking lot, right? [nervous] And, um, I notice this guy—he's like stumbling near the loading dock where, you know, those massive delivery trucks back up. [concerned] Well, the thing is, he drops his phone and he's, er, completely oblivious that this eighteen-wheeler is literally starting to reverse. [anxious] I just—I started waving my arms like crazy, [shouting] "HEY! HEY! STOP!" [pause] But honestly, the driver couldn't hear me through all that noise. [quickly] So I'm thinking, oh God oh God, and I basically sprint to security—I mean, I've never run that fast in my life. [shaky voice] And they, uhh, they radio the dock immediately and the truck stops like, [gasp loudly] maybe three feet from where this guy is still looking for his phone! [long pause] The security guard, he actually told me later that, [warm] you know, if I hadn't noticed... [trailing off] I don't even want to think about it. [proud] But anyway, they said I might get employee of the month or something, which is, [laugh] I mean, I push carts for a living, so that's pretty cool, I guess. [sigh] Just... what a day, honestly.
