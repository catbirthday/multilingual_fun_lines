And it's just sitting there: [very excited] \"Unanimous approval for industry-wide implementation.\" \n\nI keep reading it over and over because, honestly, what if I misunderstood? [nervous laugh] But no, it's—it's real. The thing is, uh, I never meant for this to be some revolutionary thing, you know? [warm] I just wanted our clinic to run better, wanted patients to actually feel heard during intake. \n\nAnd now, [anxious] oh God, what if there's something I missed? Like, what if it doesn't scale properly and then everyone's looking at me like—[pause] No. No, I tested everything. The pilots in Boston, er, Seattle, they all worked. [confidently] These protocols work because they're simple. They're human.\n\n[sigh] My mom's going to flip when I tell her. She always said I was too detail-oriented for my own good, but look—[chuckle] apparently the whole healthcare industry needed someone who color-codes their grocery lists.
