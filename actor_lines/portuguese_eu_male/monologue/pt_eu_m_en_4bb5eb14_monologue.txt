Speaker [en]: [relieved] You actually believe me. After all this time, you—God, I can't even... [crying while speaking] I know what everyone said about me, okay? The thing is, I heard every single whisper at those parties. "She's just after his money," like I was some kind of, [bitter] I don't know, predator or something. 

[pause]

But honestly, when you looked at me just now and said you knew—that you've always known deep down—I just... [very quietly] my heart literally stopped. Because, um, I fell for you that first night, actually. Not your bank account. [laughing] Not the car, not the—God, everyone thought I calculated everything, right? Like I had some master plan. 

[very sincerely] But I just loved how you'd, er, ramble about your stupid astronomy hobby for hours. How you'd get [smiling speaking] so excited about finding the perfect taco place at 2 AM. Those things, they don't—money can't buy that feeling when you'd [warm] hold my hand in the grocery store like it was the most natural thing in the world.

[sniffle]

And now you believe me. You [very excited] finally, finally see me for who I really am. Not what your mother said, or your friends warned you about, just... [whispering] me. The real me who's been loving you this whole time.
