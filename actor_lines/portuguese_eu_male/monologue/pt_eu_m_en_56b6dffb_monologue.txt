Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] Hey, I, um—I don't even know how to start this. [clearing throat] You probably don't recognize me all cleaned up like this, but I'm the guy who, you know, used to sit by the corner store? [emotional] And you'd give me your lunch every single day, like—[pause] every damn day for eight months. [crying while speaking] I got housed. I actually—I got a place. Can you believe that? [sniffle] It's just a studio, but honestly, it has walls and a door that locks and, [very sincerely], because of you I never went to bed hungry even when everything else was falling apart. [warm] You'd just hand me that brown bag and say "have a good one" like I was, I mean, like I was just anybody. Not invisible. [pause] The thing is, most people would walk past, but you—[emotional] you saw me. Actually saw me. [laugh] I start my job next week, dishwashing at that diner on Third. [confidently] And someday, I swear, I'm gonna buy YOU lunch. [very quietly] Thank you for, basically, keeping me alive when I couldn't do it myself. [warm] Thank you for treating me like a human being when I'd forgotten I was one.
