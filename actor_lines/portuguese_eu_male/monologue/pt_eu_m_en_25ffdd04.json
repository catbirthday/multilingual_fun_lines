The way the main line just... snapped. [pause] And she fell. Twenty feet. [very quietly] I knew something like this would happen. I fucking knew it. [frustrated] I sent five emails—FIVE—saying that rig wasn't rated for that weight without the secondary support. [sigh] But no, production was behind schedule, so they just, um... they made the call to skip it. [regretful] I should've refused to let the show go on. Should've walked off, made a bigger deal about it. [very sad] But I thought, I don't know, maybe they knew something I didn't? [bitter] Turns out they just didn't care.
