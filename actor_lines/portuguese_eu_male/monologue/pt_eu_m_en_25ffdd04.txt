Subject: Your rigging artist safety protocols were ignored, resulting in a performer's serious injury that could have been prevented

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [angry] I wrote it all down. Every single safety check, every load limit, every—God, I even highlighted the parts about the secondary cables. [pause] And they just... they ignored it. [bitter] "We don't have time for redundancies," that's what they said. [scoff] Three weeks I spent on those protocols, and for what? [upset] Sarah's in the hospital with a shattered pelvis because someone decided my safety specs were, what, suggestions? [shaky voice] I keep seeing it happen, you know? The way the main line just... snapped. [pause] And she fell. Twenty feet. [very quietly] I knew something like this would happen. I fucking knew it. [frustrated] I sent five emails—FIVE—saying that rig wasn't rated for that weight without the secondary support. [sigh] But no, production was behind schedule, so they just, um... they made the call to skip it. [regretful] I should've refused to let the show go on. Should've walked off, made a bigger deal about it. [very sad] But I thought, I don't know, maybe they knew something I didn't? [bitter] Turns out they just didn't care. [pause] Sarah might never perform again. [crying while speaking] And that's on me too, isn't it? Because I let them do it.
