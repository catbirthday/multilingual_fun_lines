============================================================

1. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull that up here and... can I get your, um, account number or the transaction reference?
2. Right right, so, um, I'm seeing TXN-4429-BK here and, uh, yeah it's been in pending status since, hmm, Tuesday morning at 9:47 AM and basically what happened is...
3. Actually, um, it's caught in our, uh, verification queue, so basically the system flagged it for manual review because, um, the amount was over the threshold for instant processing.
4. I know, I know, it's, um, frustrating and like, honestly? I see this happen, uh, way too often with amounts over five hundred and, hmm, let me see if I can just...
5. So, um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, submit an escalation ticket ESC-7901-MP right now and, er, normally they say forty-eight hours but, hmm, between you and me? If I mark it priority...
6. Wait, you called before about this?
7. Okay okay, so, um, let me check the notes here and... oh. I see ticket ESC-7344-RD from yesterday but, uh, it wasn't... they didn't actually submit it correctly, it's just sitting in draft status which is...
8. Listen, I'm, um, really sorry about this, like genuinely, this shouldn't... okay so, uh, I'm submitting a new one, ESC-7905-MP, right now, and um, I'm also adding my direct extension 4412 to your account notes.
9. So, um, I get why you're skeptical and, uh, honestly? Call me back at extension 4412 tomorrow if it's not resolved and I'll, um, personally walk it through to completion, like I'll literally stand over someone's shoulder if I have to.
10. Yeah, and um, just so you know, I'm putting a reminder in my calendar for tomorrow at 2 PM to check on TXN-4429-BK myself, so like, even if you don't call, I'm, uh, gonna follow up on this because... three days is ridiculous.
11. Oh, um, let me just—actually, hold on—I need to pull up your account first. Can you, uh, give me your order number or the account number for the practice?
12. Perfect, so I've got—um, wait, let me just—okay, account ACC-4982-DH, and I'm seeing here that, uh, your last shipment was marked delivered but you're saying the orthodontic brackets weren't included?
13. That's—I mean, I'm really sorry about that, um, let me check the manifest here for shipment SHP-7263-XK and, uh, oh—actually I think I see—no wait, let me just verify this.
14. I completely understand, and, um, I wish I had better news but the system's showing that order ORD-9847-TM only had twenty units authorized, not the forty you're expecting.
15. Um, so here's what I can—er, actually, hmm, let me dig deeper because I see there's a modification flag on this order from last Tuesday.
16. Right, so, uh, I'm looking at the audit log here and—um, oh, this is strange—transaction TXN-892764-B shows an inventory adjustment but, er, I can't access the full details from my level.
17. Well, I mean, technically yes but, um, I'm only able to process replacements up to a certain dollar amount and, uh, these specialty brackets are outside my authorization limit.
18. Oh, that's—I really, really wish I could just override this but, um, the system won't let me process anything over the threshold and, er, these are flagged as controlled inventory under code INV-8827-SP.
19. Of course, um, I can definitely escalate this to a supervisor but, uh, I should mention the wait might be about fifteen to twenty minutes right now.
20. Absolutely, and, er, while I'm placing you in the queue for supervisor assistance, um, I'm adding priority flag PRF-7264 to your case so they'll have all the context about the missing brackets and tomorrow's appointments.
21. Oh yeah, I totally get why that would be confusing—let me pull up your account real quick, I just need to verify with your account number or the last four digits of the card you're seeing the charges on?
22. Perfect, um, so I'm seeing account ending in 4492 and, uh, actually yeah this happens all the time and it's honestly kind of ridiculous how our parent company does this—what name are you, um, seeing on your statement?
23. Oh god, yeah, so, um, that's actually us but like—I know, I know, it's so dumb—we're owned by this, uh, bigger company and they process everything under TSG-Global which shows up as, um, Tech Solutions Global on statements and honestly we get like fifty calls a day about this.
24. I know right? It's completely ridiculous, like why can't they just use our actual company name but apparently it's some sort of payment processing thing with merchant code MRC-7829-GL and I wish I could change it but...
25. Oh no, um, yeah that's—I mean we literally have a whole, uh, FAQ page about this because it happens so much and honestly if I could just, um, march upstairs and tell them to fix it I would but they're all the way in corporate and, uh, you know how that goes...
26. Right? So, um, let me just, uh, make a note here in your account ALT-99284-K that we've explained this and, um, I can also send you an email confirmation that shows, like, the connection between our company name and Tech Solutions Global if that would help?
27. Oh absolutely, I'm actually going to send you our official merchant verification document DOC-8827-TSG right now—should hit your inbox in about two minutes—and honestly your bank sees this all the time from us so they'll probably just be like "oh yeah, them again."
28. So, um, actually that's a great question—we just, uh, switched payment processors like three weeks ago, reference number REF-20241102-PP, and I think—no wait, I know—they didn't really, um, tell customers which is kind of...
29. Yeah it's, um, honestly pretty typical and I'm sorry about that, like we should have sent an email or something but, uh, between you and me the transition has been kind of a mess and ticket number TKT-3847-MESS if you ever need to reference this conversation but hopefully you won't need to...
30. Ha! I love that attitude—honestly you're being way cooler about this than most people, and hey your confirmation email with case number CSE-9982-RESOLVED should be there now, but seriously thank you for not yelling at me about something I literally cannot control!
31. Oh, um, yeah absolutely, let me just—actually wait—so I need to, uh, pull up your account first. Can I get your member ID? It should be, um, something like MEM followed by some numbers.
32. Got it, so, um, MEM-47829-JX, and I'm seeing—oh yeah, uh, this is frustrating—your claim CLM-9058274 got rejected for, er, "prior authorization required" which is honestly, like, the worst rejection code.
33. Oh man, you get it then—this system is absolutely ridiculous sometimes. So you already know we need form PA-7741 submitted by your prescriber, and honestly between you and me? Even when they send it, half the time it gets lost in processing.
34. Wait, you—okay so, um, let me check the, uh, submission history here... I'm seeing, hmm, three attempts under reference numbers REF-8827-A, REF-8829-B, and, um, REF-8832-C, all marked as "incomplete submission" which is—I mean, that's bizarre.
35. Yeah no, I believe you, this happens—so like, um, the system has these, uh, hidden requirements that even we don't always know about? Your submission ID SUB-47289-QM shows all fields complete but, er, apparently there's some backend flag that's not... hmm.
36. Trust me, I completely get it—it's like being a mechanic with a broken car you can't touch. Look, here's what I'm gonna do—I see claim CLM-9058274 is for medication that's, let me check, time-sensitive, right?
37. Okay so, um, technically I'm not supposed to but, uh, I'm gonna escalate this directly to, er, our override team with priority code PRI-5589-URGENT, and like, they can push it through manually.
38. Well it's—so I have to—actually let me just—yeah, um, it's not in the regular system, it's a, uh, backdoor thing we use for cases like yours where the system's clearly, um, being stupid. Reference ticket TKT-20584-XP.
39. Listen, working here, I see how awful our system treats people who actually know what they're doing. Your authorization AUTH-9584-KLM should process within 24 hours now, and honestly? Save my direct extension—4782—for next time this happens.
40. No problem—and hey, your confirmation number is CNF-85947-TRX for tracking. Between us healthcare workers, we gotta stick together against these broken systems, right?
41. Right right, so basically I can, um, absolutely help you with that, and uh, let me just pull up your account here real quick, so what I'll need is, er, your email address that's been getting these messages?
42. Got it.
43. Yeah no I, um, I totally get that, so I'm looking at your profile JH-4492-EMAIL and, uh, wow you're subscribed to basically everything we've got, so let me just, er, start removing these, and like, I wish our system made this easier for you guys.
44. Absolutely, so what I'm doing is, um, going through each category here, there's like promotions, newsletters, partner offers, and uh, your preference ID is PREF-8827-QX, so basically I'm just gonna, er, uncheck everything right now.
45. Okay okay.
46. So you're on, ummm, let me count here, so there's twelve main lists, and then, uh, about eight partner lists, which is, er, honestly ridiculous, and like I'm really sorry about this, your marketing profile MKT-3341-DL shows you've been opted in since, um, 2019.
47. Right, so basically what happens is, um, our system just keeps adding you to new campaigns and, er, I'm looking at your suppression code now, SUP-7765-MK, and uh, I'm making sure this is permanent, so you won't get re-added later.
48. So no, um, not at all, your account stays totally active, and uh, this just stops the marketing stuff, so basically your account number ACC-9912-TRX remains the same, um, you can still order, check orders, everything like that.
49. Well so, um, I'm just about done here, and er, you should get a confirmation email to that gmail address with reference number CNF-4456-XP9, and uh, after that, like, you're free from our marketing department forever basically.
50. Yeah so, um, you're all set, and like, I'm sorry you had to call for this, it should just be, er, one button on the website, but anyway your opt-out is confirmed, tracking number OPT-2234-FINAL, and uh, you have a good rest of your day.
51. Jesus Christ, you serious? Move the decimal, double it—nine-fifty-six. Any third-grader with half a brain cell could figure that out without making it a whole production.
52. Cardboard? You ordered the safest thing on the menu because you're terrified of flavor. Sarah didn't judge your boring-ass palate, so pay the woman her twenty percent.
53. Oh boo-fucking-hoo, she forgot your, hmm, three leaves of iceberg lettuce. Meanwhile she's juggling twelve tables because, actually, management fired half the staff last week—I mean, cut her some slack.
54. Seven dollars? Are you, like, fucking kidding me right now? She spent two hours pretending your stupid jokes were funny—honestly, that alone deserves hazard pay, so, twenty percent minimum.
55. The wine you insisted on ordering to impress your date who left after the appetizer? Yeah, you tip on that humiliation tax too, buddy.
56. Highway robbery is you thinking, umm, anyone gives a shit about your, actually, cheap-ass complaints when Sarah's trying to pay rent on two-thirteen an hour plus whatever scraps people like you leave.
57. Ten bucks works—congratulations, you just spent five minutes bitching your way to exactly what I said in the first place. Real smooth negotiation skills there, champ.
58. No shit, Sherlock—servers tip out on total sales including, well, tax, which means they're paying the busboy and bartender whether you, honestly, tip properly or not, so yeah, we round up.
59. Moral crusade? I'm just, basically, trying to make sure our server can, hmm, afford groceries while you're crying over two extra dollars like it's your kidney.
60. Your money? You still owe me forty from last week's bar tab, but sure—I'll cover parking while you, err, pretend you're not the cheapest bastard I know, honestly.
61. Wait, that was your sister's wedding? Small world—I still have that bouquet pressed in a book somewhere, which sounds way creepier than I meant it to. I'm Marcus, by the way.
62. Nice to meet you, Riley. So are you participating in this medieval torture ritual they call a garter toss, or are you just here for moral support?
63. Well, the thing is, I'm [loudly] supposed to be catching this thing too, you know, because apparently my aunt thinks, um, twenty-eight is basically ancient for a bachelor. She literally pushed me onto the dance floor just now.
64. Three? That's, uh, impressive efficiency on her part. My record is five at my cousin's bar mitzvah, but, I mean, that was a six-hour event so she had more time to work with.
65. Oh absolutely not—one was, hmm, my dentist's daughter who spent twenty minutes describing her cat's anxiety medication, and another one, well, turned out to be my ex's new roommate. The universe has a twisted sense of humor sometimes.
66. Thanksgiving setup? That's advanced level parent meddling right there. At least at weddings you can escape to the bar—at Thanksgiving you're trapped until the pie comes out.
67. A PowerPoint presentation at Thanksgiving dinner? That's simultaneously the most terrifying and impressive thing I've ever heard. Did she at least have good slide design?
68. You know what, I respect the commitment to branding. If you're going to scare someone off, might as well do it with style and proper kerning.
69. Here we go—time to, basically, pretend we want to catch a piece of lace while, you know, twenty drunk relatives cheer like it's the damn Super Bowl.
70. Deal—though fair warning, I have surprisingly good reflexes when alcohol and peer pressure are involved. My catching-random-wedding-objects record is currently two and zero.
71. Well, first impressions are usually right, you know, so if you bombed it, they probably already made up their minds about you. Actually, studies show people decide within seven seconds whether they like someone or not.
72. Yeah uh, truth hurts [sniffle] sometimes, I mean. Look, not everyone is cut out for every job—maybe this one just isn't your thing and you should start looking for something else before they fire you.
73. Oh so, spilling coffee in front of [friendly] everyone, that's kind of your opening move? Classic sign of someone who cracks under pressure—I've seen it a million times at my office.
74. Sure, blame the table. Everyone always has an excuse when they mess up, but successful people take responsibility instead of pointing fingers at furniture.
75. Harsh? I'm being [slurring] realistic here. If you can't handle a little honesty from a friend, how are you going to handle actual criticism from your boss when performance reviews come around?
76. Hmm, support without honesty is just enabling, the thing is. Would you rather I lie to you and say everything's fine when clearly you're struggling with basic motor skills in professional settings?
77. I'm just saying, adults don't usually spill beverages at work. My five-year-old nephew has better coordination, and he's still learning to tie his shoes.
78. Right, because avoiding feedback is definitely the path to success. No wonder you're having trouble at work if this is how you handle constructive criticism.
79. Running away from conversations, ah, that's another pattern I've noticed with you, sort of just bailing when things get real, I guess.
80. Right so, now I'm the bad guy for err, trying to help you see reality? It's just that you always do this—ask for advice then get mad when it's not what you want to hear.
81. Welcome to the mystical corner of our festival! I'm about to demonstrate something [long pause] extraordinary with numbers, but first, let me ask you to think of any number between one and a thousand.
82. Ah, the skepticism is natural, you know, but here's the thing, numbers have vibrations, actually, that most people can't perceive. Your number is... three hundred and forty-seven, and you chose it because it has personal significance, perhaps a date?
83. Trade secret, my friend, but anyway, let me show you something else, er, even more fascinating, honestly. Pick a card from this deck, memorize it, and I'll tell you not just the card but the number you're visualizing on it.
84. Seven of hearts, and hmm, you're imagining the number seven glowing, sort of, in gold, right? That's because, well, your mind associates that number with luck or maybe a birthday in July?
85. Years of practice reading micro-expressions, body language, [relieved] and honestly, a bit of showmanship never hurts, you know? But here's where it gets really interesting - I want you to write down any four-digit number on this paper without showing me.
86. Fold it up, hold it tight, and basically, I'm going to attempt something, er, I rarely do in public, okay so, just concentrate on those digits. Two... nine... four... eight. Your birth year perhaps?
87. The beautiful thing about illusion is that it lives in the space between reality and impossibility. Now, for my finale, I need you to multiply your age by two, add five, then multiply by fifty.
88. One thousand seven hundred and fifty, which means you're thirty years old, born in nineteen ninety-four, which connects beautifully to that number you wrote earlier, doesn't it?
89. Most people have that reaction, but here's the thing, err, the real magic isn't in the tricks themselves, you know, it's in reminding people that the world is full of wonder. Would you like to learn one simple number trick to amaze your friends?
90. Perfect! Take any three-digit number, reverse it, subtract the smaller from the larger, and the answer will always be divisible by ninety-nine - mathematics disguised as magic, but don't tell anyone that secret.
91. A sabbatical? Right now? We're literally drowning in deadlines and you're thinking about taking time off? The quarterly review is in three weeks!
92. Oh god, okay, but can we at least wait until after the merger? Everything's hanging by a thread and I can't handle this alone!
93. There's never a [stern] perfect time, but literally any time except now when we're restructuring the entire department and I'm already working weekends!
94. Three months feels like three years when you're the only senior person left and everyone else is either new or completely checked out already!
95. Sarah's going on maternity leave, er, next month, and basically, Marcus just put in his two weeks, I mean, yesterday afternoon actually!
96. He got headhunted by, um, [very sincerely] that startup, and honestly, I can't even blame him because, well, they're offering twice what we pay.
97. Look, I'm [apologetic] sorry for freaking out, it's just that, uhh, everything's falling apart and, actually, I haven't slept properly in weeks.
98. Survive? We'll barely function! You're the only one who knows the legacy systems and half our clients specifically request you for projects!
99. Training someone properly takes months, not weeks, and honestly we don't even have anyone qualified enough to absorb what you do here!
100. Absolutely! But here we are with zero redundancy, mounting pressure, and now you want to disappear when everything's already on fire!
101. [bitter] So you finally show up when there's, [hollow], money involved, not when I had the surgery, not when I nearly, [trembling], died from the complications, but now when you can, [cold], build a case.
102. [exhausted] Don't call me that like you, uh, suddenly remember who I am when for years you've treated me like, [sinking], just another name in your contact list that you, well, never quite get around to calling, like I'm some, [distant], unfinished task.
103. [weary] I suppose you need me to, um, sign something, give a deposition about how this thing, [gesturing], has been ticking inside me like a bomb for, well, five years now.
104. You always were good at, um, making everything sound noble when really you're just, [accusatory], doing your job, collecting your thirty percent while the rest of us, well, live with the, [heavy], consequences.
105. [scoffs] Um, still time.
106. [resigned] The doctors say this device could, um, fail any day now and when it does, I have maybe, [shaking], ten minutes to get to a hospital before my heart, well, just stops. [long pause]
107. [flat] Well, now you know why I stopped, um, making plans beyond next week and why your mother's spare bedroom became, [heavy], my permanent address after I couldn't, like, live alone anymore.
108. She said you had enough on your plate with your, [sardonic], important cases saving the world one lawsuit at a time.
109. [tired] After seventy-four years, my body's too weak for another surgery and honestly, well, I'm tired of being cut open, tired of, [fading], fighting, tired of waiting for my son to remember I exist beyond being a potential, um, plaintiff.
110. [quietly] Just sit with me for a while, no papers, no, [gentle], depositions, just sit.
111. Nossa. Hum, está bem então—deixa-me só—na verdade, hmm, cinco vezes? Isso é... Não. Vamos resolver isto. Número de conta?
112. 6 anos. Família militar? Estou a ver mudanças aqui. Fevereiro. Abril. Junho. Agosto. Agora outubro. A conta ACT-7783-PMQ mostra tudo.
113. Não não não. Para. Isto é—espera, deixa-me só—hum, estou a abrir uma coisa. Código de perfil MIL-SPOUSE-92. Ah, isto devia ter sido sinalizado. Alguém falhou aqui.
114. Faz todo o sentido. Estou a ver o rastreamento. Três devoluções. Duas encomendas perdidas. Números de referência RTN-8847-X e RTN-8849-K. Isto acaba hoje.
115. Está bem então, hum, é o seguinte que vou fazer. Preparado? Hum, protocolo de reencaminhamento permanente. Código PFP-ACTIVE-7. Basicamente, ah, alguma coisa corre mal? Reencaminha automaticamente. Sem formulários.
116. Porque a maioria dos agentes não sabe. Ou não quer saber. Anulação para Cônjuge Militar. MSO-77429-Q acabei de ativar. Mudas-te? Uma chamada. 5 minutos. Feito.
117. E, hum, ouve—também vou, ah, adicionar estatuto prioritário? Tipo, as tuas coisas são enviadas primeiro. Sempre. Confirmação PSC-9847-GOLD. Isso é, hum, normalmente para contas empresariais mas...
118. Qual é a tua morada nova? Completa. Vou garantir que isto fica perfeito.
119. Vai funcionar. Hum, e aqui está a minha linha direta. Tipo, a minha secretária mesmo. 555-0147 extensão 291. Chamo-me Marcus. Mudas-te outra vez? Liga-me. Não para o número geral. Para mim.
120. Não vai. As famílias militares já lidam com o suficiente. Email de confirmação enviado. Lote de atualização de encomenda UPD-5547-COMPLETE a processar agora. Deves ver as mudanças em 10 minutos. Verifica a tua caixa de entrada.
121. Oh hi there! Um, yes absolutely, I'm—I'm really happy to help you with that today! So let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, I'll need to get your member number first, it should be something like MEM-followed by, um, six digits?
122. Perfect, perfect! So I've got you here, MEM-472918, and um, I can see you're, uh, part of our institutional accounts which is—that's great actually because, hmm, we have some special procedures for museum staff, so let me just, er, check what's going on with your reimbursement here...
123. Okay so—wait let me—actually I think I see it here, um, there's a pending reimbursement request REQ-3847-AZ from, uh, March fifteenth through eighteenth? And it's showing, hmm, it's sort of stuck in processing, which is, er, probably why you're calling, right?
124. Right right, totally understand that concern! So um, what I'm seeing here is—oh this is, uh, kind of interesting actually—your submission has all the receipts but, er, there's a flag on transaction TXN-558291-Q that says, hmm, "requires secondary approval for amounts over threshold" which I think means, um, someone needs to manually review it?
125. Oh! Oh okay so—hmm let me—actually you're right, I'm looking at the individual amounts and, uh, they're all under fifty but I think maybe the, er, system added them together? So the total of, um, let me calculate... two hundred thirty-seven dollars might've triggered our, uh, our bulk review process?
126. No no no, we're—we're definitely going to fix this, don't worry! Um, so what I can do right now is, uh, I can manually override that flag because, hmm, I can see in your notes that you're, er, you're approved for workshop reimbursements up to three hundred per quarter under agreement AGR-7792-MUS, so this shouldn't have been held up at all!
127. Absolutely!
128. So let me—hmm, okay so I see, uh, three parking receipts here under reference PRK-4408-A through C, and um, those are actually—oh interesting—they're already approved and, er, it looks like they were processed last week? So you should probably be getting that reimbursement of, uh, forty-two dollars separately?
129. Oh! Um, let me check—so it's going to, uh, hmm, the account ending in... 4-7-7-9? Is that—wait, actually let me double-check because sometimes our system, er, defaults to the original account on file and maybe that's not the right one anymore?
130. Okay okay, no—we're going to sort this all out right now, I promise! So um, first thing, I'm putting a stop on that payment STP-9903-X so it doesn't go to the closed account, and then, uh, I'm going to update everything to your current account which I assume is, hmm, different? And then we'll reprocess both the workshop expenses and, er, the parking together, probably get you the full two-seventy-nine in, like, three to five business days, okay?
131. Oh não, hum, está bem então deixa-me só, ah, ver aqui a tua informação e—hmm, então basicamente o que acontece às vezes é tipo, o sistema pode, hum, encaminhar mal os créditos se houver múltiplas contas e... deixa-me ver com o que estamos a lidar, qual é o teu número de conta?
132. Certo certo, então hum, estou a ver a conta 4482-9901 aqui e, ah, deixa-me só verificar o histórico de transações—então basicamente há um crédito que foi para, hmm, espera isto é interessante, foi para a conta 4482-9902 em vez disso, hum, ID de transação TXN-847291-MK, e isso é tipo, obviamente não é a tua conta por isso...
133. Então infelizmente o que aconteceu aqui—e eu gostava mesmo de ter uma explicação melhor—mas às vezes quando as contas têm números parecidos o sistema automatizado comete estes erros de encaminhamento, especialmente com créditos processados através do ficheiro batch BTC-2847-X, e consigo ver que isto foi processado terça-feira passada...
134. Ok então, hum, aqui está a questão—e eu estou, ah, mesmo arrependido desta limitação—mas tipo, quando um crédito é lançado numa conta, mesmo que seja a errada, eu não consigo simplesmente, hum, transferi-lo diretamente, o que é super frustrante porque consigo literalmente vê-lo aqui mesmo, número de referência REF-55821-QP, mas o sistema não me deixa simplesmente, ah, movê-lo...
135. Eu sei, eu sei, é—hum, mas pronto, então o que EU POSSO fazer, ah, e isto é tipo a solução alternativa que usamos—posso submeter um pedido de correção, formulário CRQ-7756, e hum, basicamente isso sinaliza para a equipa de back office que pode, ah, reverter o crédito e reaplicá-lo, percebes?
136. Então o tempo de processamento standard para o pedido de correção CRQ-7756 é três a cinco dias úteis, mas—e aqui é onde posso realmente ajudar—se eu marcar como código de escalamento prioritário ESC-P1, deve processar dentro de vinte e quatro a quarenta e oito horas em vez disso.
137. Claro que sim! Deixa-me já tratar disso—estou a introduzir o código de prioridade ESC-P1, a associá-lo à tua transação original TXN-847291-MK, e a adicionar notas detalhadas sobre o encaminhamento errado para que o back office saiba exatamente o que aconteceu e para onde o crédito tem de ir.
138. Pronto, então hum, estou a submeter isto agora e—oh bom, passou, então o teu número de caso é, ah, CSE-94482-AA, e hum, deves receber um email de confirmação em tipo, hmm, uns dez minutos mais ou menos com todos os detalhes...
139. Sim! Então vais receber uma confirmação inicial com o número de caso CSE-94482-AA, depois outro email quando começarem a processar, e um final quando o crédito for lançado na tua conta correta—cada email terá o estado atual e o tempo estimado de conclusão.
140. Pois então, hum, também adicionei uma nota à tua conta com a referência REF-CREDIT-FIX por isso se precisares de ligar de volta, ah, qualquer agente consegue ver exatamente o que fizemos hoje, e tipo, vão ter todos os números de caso e tudo, por isso... há mais alguma coisa em que possa ajudar já que estamos aqui?
141. Certo certo, pois então hum, deixe-me só abrir isso—isso aqui rapidamente e, ah, percebo perfeitamente esses prazos do trabalho são—são absolutamente ridículos às vezes sinceramente. Qual é o, hum, qual é o seu número de encomenda ou conta?
142. Ok perfeito então, ah, tenho aqui a conta RNG-4521-PKS e estou a ver—oh bem pois há tipo, hum, três encomendas diferentes do mês passado que não têm—desculpe, quer dizer faltam os recibos detalhados o que é, ah, super irritante eu sei porque o nosso sistema devia automaticamente... enfim deixe-me arranjar isto.
143. Oh tem—tem toda a razão na verdade, hum, há mais uma escondida na transação TXN-891265-OCT que não estava—não estava ligada corretamente o que sinceramente acontece demasiadas vezes com as nossas, ah, nossas encomendas em volume é um bocado embaraçoso mas, hum, deixe-me só juntar isto tudo rapidamente.
144. Sim sim completamente, então hum, vou—vou juntar tudo no documento DOC-7739-COMB e, ah, sinceramente cá entre nós? A nossa equipa de contabilidade complica isto muito mais do que devia mas, hum, posso adicionar todos os códigos de isenção fiscal e—e a informação de faturação do departamento que precisas.
145. Oh não pode ser, isso é—isso é completamente inaceitável, hum, deixa-me garantir que este fica à prova de bala então, ah, vou adicionar o código de verificação VER-3982-EXEMPT e vou pôr, hum, pôr a autorização do teu departamento mesmo—mesmo no topo onde não podem deixar de ver desta vez.
146. Completamente. Não quer dizer, ah, eu trabalhava com—com contas governamentais e é simplesmente... a papelada é uma loucura sinceramente. O teu número de confirmação vai ser CNF-4455-URGENT e estou, hum, estou a marcar como prioritário para ultrapassar o habitual, ah, o disparate habitual dos três dias de processamento.
147. Certo certo. Expedito.
148. Sim então, hum, estou mesmo a verificar—verificar duas vezes aqui e o teu lote de recibos RBT-9901-COMPLETE tem, ah, tudo o que possam vir a pedir tipo detalhamento, NIF, ordens de compra, o—o pacote completo basicamente e sinceramente se rejeitarem este eu, hum, eu escalava porque este está perfeito agora.
149. Perfeito e, ah, só para saberes o número de referência REF-6672-RANGER está—está anexado a tudo por isso se alguém te chatear só, hum, só citas isso e vão ver que basicamente sinalizei isto como, ah, como pré-aprovado para reembolso o que tecnicamente não devia fazer mas...
150. Não não totalmente justo, hum, sinceramente eu—eu faria o mesmo e entre nós? Às vezes é a única forma de conseguir que as coisas, ah, sejam mesmo resolvidas por aqui mas os teus documentos estão—estão a enviar agora para jones arroba parks ponto gov com cópia de segurança BCK-2234-FILE por isso estás—estás pronto e, hum, devem aprovar sem problema desta vez.
151. Hum, está bem então, ah, deixa-me só—não espera—deixa-me abrir o, hum, portal de formação contínua aqui e, ah, basicamente posso ajudar-te com isso, então qual é o teu número de conta ou, hum, email?
152. Certo, certo.
153. Então, hum, estou a ver aqui—ah, espera, deixa-me só—ok então basicamente a tua conta SMT-4429-CE mostra, hum, duas cobranças idênticas de 189€ cada no dia 12 de outubro, e ah, isso não é, tipo, culpa tua de todo.
154. Hum, não não, então tipo, isto acontece, ah, constantemente na verdade com o nosso, hum—o processador de pagamentos que usamos às vezes, er, duplica cobranças quando há, ah, problemas de latência, então basicamente posso processar o reembolso RFD-9281-X agora mesmo.
155. São dois segundos.
156. Não é parva. Três a cinco dias.
157. Então, hum, na verdade—er, deixa-me só—posso, ah, aplicar o código de crédito CRD-1847-PF à tua conta agora mesmo então, hum, basicamente poderias inscrever-te hoje sem, tipo, esperar pelo reembolso se quiseres?
158. Hum, sim então, ah, ando a fazer isto há, er, seis anos e basicamente, hum, com profissionais de saúde tentamos, tipo, agilizar as coisas porque, ah, sabes, prazos de formação contínua e isso tudo—já processei aliás.
159. Acontece constantemente.
160. Hum, então tipo, já está, ah, aplicado à tua conta então quando, er, finalizares a compra vai, hum, automaticamente deduzir o crédito de 189€—e ah, vais receber o email de confirmação CNF-6720-B em, tipo, cinco minutos basicamente.
161. Oh absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Deixa-me só abrir a sua conta aqui, e vou precisar de verificar umas informações primeiro, posso ter o seu número de ID de funcionário por favor?
162. Perfect, um, let me just... como é que se diz... navegar para a secção de salários aqui, e uh, estou a ver ID de funcionário 6314, e um, podes confirmar o teu apelido para mim?
163. Great, so um, Mr. Chen, tenho o teu perfil aqui com código de funcionário EMP-6314-KC e uh, disseste que há um problema com o teu salário, então tipo, o que é que parece estar mal especificamente?
164. Okay okay, so let me check your recent pay stub, número de referência PAY-112024-6314, e consigo ver as tuas horas base registadas em 40, mas fala-me das horas extra que mencionaste?
165. Alright so, um, 54 total hours, o que seria, uh, deixa-me só... isso são 14 horas de horas extra, e um, olhando para a folha de horas TS-6314-W46, só estou a ver 48 horas registadas, então isso é definitivamente uma discrepância que precisamos de corrigir.
166. Oh absolutely, yes! Então um, o que eu vou fazer é, uh, preciso de criar o que se chama... hmm, qual é o termo... um pedido de ajuste de salário, e isso vai ser o ticket número ADJ-20241115-6314, e tipo, isto deve ser processado bastante rapidamente.
167. Right right, totally understand the urgency here, então o pedido de ajuste ADJ-20241115-6314 normalmente processa dentro de 2 a 3 dias úteis, e depois o pagamento corrigido chega à tua conta dentro de 24 horas após aprovação.
168. So, um, today's Thursday, o que significa, uh, se tudo correr bem—e deixa-me só—aliás, hmm, posso marcar isto como prioridade com o código PRI-HOUSING, e um, isso normalmente acelera as coisas para tipo, processamento no próximo dia útil?
169. Perfect! And um, just so you know, também vou, uh, enviar-te um email de confirmação com número de referência CNF-6314-111524, e tipo, isso vai ter todos os detalhes sobre o valor do ajuste e data esperada de depósito, o teu email registado ainda está atual?
170. Of course! Então estás todo arranjado com o ticket de ajuste ADJ-20241115-6314 marcado como prioridade, e deves receber esse email de confirmação dentro da próxima hora, e honestamente se não vires o depósito até segunda, liga-nos definitivamente de volta e referencia esse número de ticket!
171. Está bem, hum, deixe-me abrir aqui a sua conta. Pode dar-me, ah, o número da conta ou o email associado ao processamento de pagamentos?
172. Então, hum, qualquer um serve. Posso pesquisar por, é, como é que se diz... conta de comerciante ou nome de cliente. O que tiver mais à mão. Deixe-me só, ah, entrar aqui no sistema de disputas.
173. Entendido. Ok então estou a ver, hum, caso de disputa DSP-44729-RT aqui registado há três dias no valor de 4.200€. É isso, ah, é isso que estamos a ver?
174. Certo. Então, hum, vendo aqui as notas, eles alegam, é, serviços não prestados? Mas consigo ver que tem, ah, histórico de transações com cobranças semanais. Números de referência TXN-8847291 até TXN-8847296.
175. Ok, hum, isso é bom. Isso é mesmo, ah, muito bom. Então o que precisamos fazer é, é, compilar a sua documentação. Tem faturas, fotos das refeições, alguma coisa assim?
176. Perfeito. Então, ah, eis o que acontece. Vai carregar essas para o caso número DSP-44729-RT. Vou, hum, enviar-lhe um link. Deve ajudar bastante o seu caso.
177. Olhe, eu já, é, faço isto há algum tempo. A documentação ganha estes casos. Carregue tudo. Recibos, fotos, hum, quaisquer mensagens sobre as refeições. O sistema mostra confirmações de entrega na morada deles todas as semanas.
178. Então depois de submeter através do link do portal PLK-7739-XM, vai para revisão. Normalmente, hum, demora cerca de 5-7 dias úteis. Mas com o seu histórico de transações, ah, honestamente? Está numa posição razoável aqui.
179. Eu percebo. Então, é, enquanto a disputa está em revisão, os fundos ficam, hum, temporariamente retidos. Mas vou marcar isto como revisão prioritária código PRV-445. Deve acelerar um pouco as coisas.
180. Sem problema. Hum, mas certifique-se que carrega esses documentos hoje, está bem? Quanto mais cedo os colocarmos no DSP-44729-RT, ah, mais rápido isto anda. Vai conseguir.
181. Oh wow, eight years, that's—that's significant loyalty. I can see your account here, ACC-7891-DM, and um, there's a—what's the word—a damage claim filed yesterday for, uh, for a scratch incident?
182. You documented it? That's—no wait, actually—that's really good. Really good. Um, I'm looking at claim CLM-5502-XK91 and I don't—I don't see any prior damage notes yet but let me check—let me check another screen here.
183. No, you're right. Not fair at all. I've seen this—this kind of thing happen before and it's... frustrating. Really frustrating. Your photos should be under reference PHT-8823-NL if you uploaded them through our app?
184. Perfect. Okay okay okay. So I'm—I'm pulling up the timeline for vehicle VEH-2234-QP and, um, hmm, there's a... what's the word... a discrepancy? Between when you clocked in at 2:14 PM and when the damage report was filed.
185. Six years with no claims—that's that's impressive. Really impressive. Looking at your profile, employee ID EMP-9087-TZ, you have, uh, perfect ratings actually.
186. Oh no. What—let me just—what happened with the owner?
187. Threw keys at you? That's—I mean—that's completely unacceptable. Um, I'm adding that to report RPT-6671-MK because that's, uh, that's relevant context here. Really relevant.
188. You know what? I—no wait—I think you might be onto something there. The photos you took, timestamp TSP-4420-JH shows 2:16 PM, but the owner didn't report anything until, um, until 5:47 PM. That's that's a three hour gap.
189. Cameras. Yes. Good good good. Security footage request SFR-7745-BC, I'm—I'm filing that right now. Um, between you and me? This claim is looking, uh, what's the word... questionable? Really questionable.
190. I do. I absolutely do. Your case number is CSE-9981-WM and I'm—let me just—I'm escalating this to our fraud investigation team because, um, honestly? Eight years of loyalty, six years perfect valet record? We're we're going to fight this for you.
191. Oh, hmm, let me just... okay so I'm pulling up your account here and, um, let me see here... account number ACC-4892-NJ91, and you're absolutely right, you've been—you've been with us since, wow, 2016, that's really... okay so, um, what I'm seeing is that you're referring to our, uh, our new customer promotion?
192. Right right, so, um, I totally understand why that would be, you know, frustrating, because here's the thing—let me just, hmm, what's the best way to... okay so basically our new customer offers are, um, they're like a... what's the word... an acquisition thing? But but but I'm looking at your account ACC-4892-NJ91 and, um, I actually see some opportunities here that might, uh, might actually work better for you.
193. Okay okay, so, um, here's what I'm going to do—and this is, uh, this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I can see you're on plan code PLN-7700-X, and, hmm, let me think... there's actually a loyalty discount I can—I can apply retroactively that would, um, save you about forty-eight dollars per month going forward?
194. Oh, um, wait, you've—you've had issues with this before? Let me just, uh, let me check your case history here... hmm, okay so I see ticket number TKT-991204-B from, um, three months ago where someone promised... oh no, that's—that's not right, they didn't actually process that correctly, I'm so sorry.
195. Absolutely, um, completely understand, and you know what? I'm—I'm going to personally make sure this gets fixed today, like, um, not just promise it but actually... let me do this right now while we're on the phone, okay? So so so I'm applying credit code CRD-8847-MV22, and, uh, that's going to show up immediately on your account.
196. That's that's a really fair question, and, um, honestly after what happened last time, I'd be skeptical too, so hmm... what if I, uh, what if I send you the confirmation email right now while we're talking? Your email on file is still, um, let me see here... ends in gmail dot com, right?
197. I know I know, and, um, you shouldn't have to keep dealing with this, it's—it's really not fair to you, so let me just... okay confirmation number CNF-445892-RTK just went through, and, uh, I'm also going to put a note—a really detailed note—on your account so nobody can, um, mess this up again.
198. Mmm yeah, so, um, that's actually—that's a really good point, because what often happens is, uh, these credits expire and then you're back to... hmm, let me think about how to... okay okay, so what I'm going to do is set up a, uh, a permanent adjustment under code ADJ-7712-PRM that doesn't—doesn't expire, it just stays on your account.
199. Right. Totally hear you. Um, so so so here's the thing—I'm going to, uh, give you my direct extension, it's 4-4-7-2-9, and if this ever, um, if anything happens with this adjustment, you call me directly and I'll—I'll personally fix it, like I'm putting my name on this, reference number REF-20240115-KLM, that's tied to me specifically.
200. And and and you know what? I'm also going to, um, schedule a follow-up for myself to check on this in, hmm, let's say thirty days? Just to make sure everything's, uh, everything's still applied correctly, because I really—I really want to make sure you don't have to deal with this again, your loyalty account LAC-4892-NJ91 deserves so much better than what you've been getting.
201. Está bem está bem, deixe-me—deixe-me abrir aqui a sua conta. Pode, hum, dar-me o seu número de conta ou, ah, o número de telefone associado?
202. Certo certo, tenho aqui a sua conta, ACC-7739-JK, e consigo ver—hmm—consigo ver algumas transações de portagem recentes. Deixe-me só, ah, deixe-me ver o padrão aqui.
203. Compreendo—compreendo essa frustração. Então olhando para, hum, o seu histórico de transações TXN-8847291, há, ah, há definitivamente algo... como é que hei de dizer... irregular aqui com estas cobranças.
204. Percebido.
205. Ok então, hum, estou a ver cobranças de—deixe-me, ah, deixe-me documentar isto como deve ser—há umas das zonas B47 e, hum, C22 no seu relatório RPT-6633-AA que, ah, que não correspondem de todo ao seu percurso habitual.
206. Absolutamente absolutamente. Vou—hmm—preciso de, ah, escalar isto mas, hum, mas a questão é esta. O processo de revisão automática demora, ah, demora cerca de 10 dias úteis.
207. Sei—sei que não é ideal. Deixe-me, ah, deixe-me ver o que mais—ok ok, então o número de caso CSE-99042-D está criado, e, hum, posso marcá-lo como prioritário mas isso ainda significa, ah, 5-7 dias no mínimo.
208. Ah—ah estou a ver. Isso, hum, isso definitivamente muda... Deixe-me verificar se—hmm—se há uma opção de crédito temporário enquanto investigamos.
209. Bem, não é—não é o procedimento padrão mas, ah, dado o padrão aqui no ficheiro FLE-8829-TT que mostra, hum, discrepâncias claras, posso—posso pedir um ajuste provisório de, ah, deixe-me calcular... 147,50€.
210. O código de crédito CRD-4401-YY seria, hum, seria processado esta noite, portanto veria isso até, ah, até amanhã de manhã. E depois faremos—faremos a investigação completa para o montante restante.
211. Ah claro, então eu posso—espere, deixe-me só—pronto, posso mesmo ajudá-lo com a documentação fiscal hoje, é, deixe-me abrir aqui a sua conta com a referência ACC-7823-NP94.
212. Certo certo, então é, estou a ver aqui que está à procura de—é, deixe-me ter a certeza que percebi—precisa das suas declarações anuais para efeitos de IRS, e hum, posso gerar essas do lote de transações TXB-2023-4401 agora mesmo aliás.
213. Ah seguro, percebi—então na verdade—hmm, deixe-me só—para pedidos de reembolso do seguro precisamos de puxar documentação diferente, é, especificamente o seu relatório de histórico de pagamentos PHR-8834-QJ e, é, quaisquer recibos detalhados do período de cobertura que está a reclamar.
214. Perfeito, então é, consigo ver aqui todos os seus pagamentos de prémios e, é, aliás—espere, deixe-me só—ok então posso enviar-lhe por email o relatório consolidado CRP-9901-XK22 que mostra, hum, todos os pagamentos de prémios de janeiro a dezembro com códigos de confirmação.
215. Ok ok.
216. Ai não, então—quer dizer, é, percebo perfeitamente a urgência agora e, é, estou mesmo—deixe-me agilizar isto—então em vez do processo normal, hum, estou a gerar um documento de verificação instantâneo IVD-3847-MM91 que vai ter tipo, é, literalmente em dois minutos.
217. Então sim, é, na verdade estou—espere, deixe-me só confirmar—pois, o lote de documentos DOC-7765-PL está, é, já a processar e, eh, consigo ver que está a 60% completo agora mesmo, portanto hum, sinceramente provavelmente até menos de dois minutos.
218. Ai meu deus, hum, ok então—lamento imenso mas—os documentos de 2022 estão, é, estão no nosso sistema arquivado e isso é—quer dizer, isso demora um bocado mais a recuperar, hum, provavelmente uns quinze a vinte minutos para o pedido de arquivo ARQ-2022-8856.
219. Então na verdade—hmm, espere deixe-me tentar—tenho uma ideia aqui, hum, se não se importar de, é, recebê-los como ficheiros separados, posso puxar os resumos trimestrais de 2022 da cache CSH-4492-BN e, eh, esses estão disponíveis imediatamente.
220. A enviar agora, então é, deve receber quatro ficheiros com a referência RFX-9923-QQ41, e, é, estão identificados Q1 a Q4 para 2022, mais o seu relatório consolidado de 2023 está, hum, já na sua caixa de entrada—aliás pode verificar e confirmar que os recebeu?
221. Oh no no no, um, you're absolutely fine, don't worry about that at all! I'm here to help with, uh, whatever you need today. Let me just, um, pull up the right screen here and—sorry, the system's being a bit slow—there we go. What can I assist you with?
222. Of course, of course.
223. Please, um, please don't feel awkward at all, this is—we handle these transfers, uh, pretty regularly actually. Let me just get into the, um, the prepaid services system here, it's loading up now with reference code PSV-4429-RT, and, uh, I'll need just a few details from you to get started, okay?
224. Morrison, okay, um, let me search that for you right now... I'm seeing, uh, let's see here... three Morrison accounts in our prepaid system, so I'll need to—sorry, let me narrow this down—um, do you happen to have maybe a first name or, uh, an account number?
225. Right right, yes.
226. Oh please, um, honestly you're doing just fine, and I completely understand this is, uh, this can be a difficult process. So I've found Margaret Morrison's account here, it's showing as, um, account number PRE-88256-MK, and I can see it's been active since—sorry, let me scroll down—since 2019, is that sounding right to you?
227. Perfect, so, um, now what I'm going to do is, uh, I'm going to set up what we call a—sorry, it's called a beneficiary transfer protocol, and um, basically this ensures that all the prepaid services get properly, uh, moved over to your funeral home's system, okay?
228. Actually yes, um, that would be really helpful, thank you for thinking of that! And, uh, while you're getting that, I'm just going to, um, make a note here in case number CSE-90847-PL that we're initiating this transfer today so there's no—sorry, so nothing gets delayed on your end.
229. FL-4492, got it, perfect, um, and I'm entering that now... okay so, uh, the good news is everything's verified and I can see your funeral home is already in our, um, our approved provider network under ID FHP-3365-K, which means this should be, uh, really straightforward from here.
230. No no, um, please don't apologize at all! You've been wonderful to work with and, uh, listen, I'm going to personally monitor this transfer with tracking number TRN-55429-QM to make sure it goes through smoothly, and um, I'll even send you an email confirmation so you have everything, uh, everything documented on your end, okay? Is there anything else I can help you with today?
231. Está bem. Deixa-me. Hm. Abrir aqui a tua conta. Podes—desculpa, quero dizer, uh, qual é o teu número de conta? Ou na verdade. Email also works. O que tiveres.
232. Certo certo. Subscription. Isso—está bem então, hm, estou a ver aqui a conta KEN-4892-PL, e uh, há definitivamente alguma atividade. Deixa-me só. Verificar as recentes. Hm. The recent charges.
233. Então estou, uh, estou a ver aqui que tu—hmm, está bem isto é, hm, interessante. O cancelamento para, uh, para a encomenda SUB-7731-WK foi processado a 3 de outubro. Mas. Ainda há. Hmm.
234. Na verdade há—deixa-me ver isto de outra forma. Tu tens. Três subscrições? Não espera. Desculpa, two subscriptions under KEN-4892-PL.
235. Está bem então. Hm. Uma está definitivamente cancelada—that's SUB-7731-WK, uh, which was the pet food. Mas. Hmm. A das coisas de limpeza, essa é, uh, SUB-7739-WK, e está. Still active?
236. Sim são—desculpa, devia ter, hm, apanhado isto antes. They're separate. O representante que. Uh. Que te ajudou antes só cancelou. Uma. Not both.
237. Isso é, hm, isso seria a, uh, subscrição de produtos de limpeza a 127,50€, e está—hmm, deixa-me só—está programada para cobrar novamente no, uh, no dia 15.
238. Absolutamente. Eu posso. Fazer isso agora mesmo. Just need to. Confirm. Tu queres a SUB-7739-WK completamente cancelada?
239. Não. Tudo feito. A tua confirmação é CAN-9847-ZM. No more automatic charges. Está tudo cancelado agora.
240. Estás pronto. Both subscriptions cancelled. A conta KEN-4892-PL está. Completamente limpa. Sem mais surpresas.
241. Hey there! That's interesting, let me pull up... what's happening with verification?
242. Oh that's... um, that's actually pretty unusual. So you're, uh, having trouble with the callbacks? Your account ID, er, would be starting with ATH-7264 if you're institutional...
243. Hmm, so, um, let me think here... you're traveling and, uh, missing our verification calls? That's... er, that's weird because we usually...
244. Okay so, um, this is interesting... I'm seeing, uh, twelve attempted calls to your number ending in 8847? And they're all, er, during what looks like...
245. Right right, um, 8847, sorry. So here's what's, uh, happening... the system's trying to reach you, um, between 2 and 4 PM Eastern, which is probably when you're...
246. That's the puzzle piece! Okay so... wait, this is actually fixable. Your verification code VRF-92847-TM just needs...
247. No no, you don't need that code. That's our side. Here's what we do... text verification instead. To that 8847 number.
248. Yeah! Been doing this eight years. Athletic departments always have this issue. Let me just update your preference flag to TXT-ONLY...
249. There we go. Updated. You'll get a text in about... thirty seconds actually. Confirmation code CNF-44872-SP.
250. Beautiful! That code's good for 72 hours. Even from the bus. We're all set here.
251. Então, hum, deixa-me só—está bem, portanto basicamente estou aqui a abrir a tua conta e, ah, preciso primeiro de verificar algumas informações, é, podes dar-me o teu número de funcionário ou, hum, os últimos quatro do NIF?
252. Está bem então, hum, estou a ver aqui que estás com, ah, deixa-me só—pronto está a mostrar a conta EMP-7734-NC21 e, hmm, estás listado como ajudante de cozinha no, hum, no local do centro, é isso?
253. Oh claro que sim, tipo, hum, tens todo o direito de contestar qualquer dedução e, ah, estou a ver aqui o teu registo de vencimentos na transação PAY-8892-XK e, é, consigo ver a dedução do uniforme de cento e vinte euros lançada no dia quinze.
254. Então, hum, na verdade—não espera, deixa-me só—pronto portanto basicamente o teu nível de emprego não, ah, não importa nada quando se trata de contestar deduções, e hum, olhando aqui para o código POL-4421-B, todos os funcionários independentemente do cargo têm os mesmos direitos de contestação.
255. Hmm, então estou só, hum, a rever os teus documentos de integração no ficheiro ONB-9956-RT22 e, ah, deixa-me ver aqui—portanto basicamente a política de uniformes mostra que, é, os uniformes iniciais devem na verdade ser fornecidos sem custo para posições de ajudante.
256. Pois então, hum, isto é—quer dizer, ah, isto parece mesmo um erro da parte deles, e é, o que vou fazer é, hum, abrir uma contestação com o número de caso DSP-3348-QV91 para ti agora mesmo.
257. Então normalmente, hum, estas contestações levam cerca de, ah, cinco a sete dias úteis a processar, mas é, como isto parece uma clara violação da política ao abrigo do, hum, ao abrigo do regulamento REG-2247-A, posso na verdade acelerar isto para ti.
258. Então basicamente, hum, com processamento acelerado posso—deixa-me só—pronto então estou a marcar isto como prioritário e, ah, deves ver o reembolso dentro de, é, dois a três dias úteis, e hum, vai aparecer como crédito CRD-5589-MN12 no teu próximo recibo de vencimento.
259. Não não, então hum, quando esta contestação for aprovada—e ah, honestamente com a documentação que estou a ver aqui vai ser—eles não podem, é, voltar a deduzir este montante, e também estou a adicionar uma nota sob a referência REF-7702-LP sobre a violação da política.
260. Então, hum, está tudo tratado e, ah, vais receber um email de confirmação com o teu número de contestação DSP-3348-QV91 dentro de uma hora, e é, se tiveres algum problema ou, hum, se tentarem deduzir mais alguma coisa para uniformes, refere só este caso e, ah, e estás coberto, está bem?
261. Okay, let me just, hmm, pull up your information here. Can you give me your account number or, um, the phone number associated with the account so I can, uh, take a look at what's been happening?
262. Right right.
263. So I'm seeing here, um, your account number ACC-7739-QR22, and, hmm, okay so there's definitely a pattern of, uh, recurring issues with the automatic payment system. Let me see here... looks like you've spoken with, um, four different representatives about this?
264. No no no, you're not—this isn't on you at all. So looking at ticket TKT-889542-A, um, it seems like every time we've, uh, supposedly fixed it, the system just, hmm, reverts back after about 72 hours, which is, um, honestly pretty frustrating.
265. Yeah, so, um, between you and me? This particular issue with reference code ERR-2847-BX is, uh, kind of ridiculous. We've had, hmm, at least thirty similar complaints this month alone, and, um, the technical team keeps saying it's fixed but clearly...
266. I know, I know.
267. You're absolutely right, and, um, I'm going to do something different here. Let me, hmm, escalate this directly to our tier-three team with priority flag PRI-9982-HIGH, because, uh, having you call five times for the same issue is, um, completely unacceptable.
268. Hmm, I completely understand that frustration. So here's what I'm thinking, um, while I process this escalation under case number ESC-4456-ZM91, I can also, uh, apply a service credit to your account for, hmm, let's see... three months worth of the inconvenience?
269. So, uh, honestly? With the escalation code I'm using, ESC-4456-ZM91-PRIORITY, um, they have to respond within 24 hours or it goes straight to, uh, executive support. And, hmm, I'm also adding notes that this is your fifth call, which, um, basically guarantees they'll actually look at it properly this time.
270. Absolutely.
271. Ah hm, pois então, deixa-me só, eh, abrir a tua conta e vamos, tipo, resolver isto tudo. Posso, hm, ter o teu email ou, eh, número de conta?
272. Ok ok. Pronto então, hm, Margaret—posso tratar-te por Margaret?—então basicamente estou a ver, eh, 3 subscrições de streaming diferentes aqui. Account ID ACC-7749-MZK. Deixa-me só, er, explicar-te isto rapidinho.
273. Pois pois, então hm, o que aconteceu foi—e tipo, cá entre nós? Isto acontece, eh, imenso. Tens o BritBox por 6,99€, mas depois também há, hm, o StreamPlus Premium a 15,99€ na transação TXN-8823904, e eh, uma coisa chamada MegaFlix por 12,99€.
274. Ok ok, então, hm, ouve Margaret—vou, tipo, ser sincero contigo aqui. These companies basically count on people not noticing, sabes? Mas hm, vamos resolver isto já.
275. Não não, absolutamente. Então hm, a verificar o teu histórico aqui—número de referência REF-5521-QQT—estes extra, eh, começaram há 3 meses. Maybe you clicked on some free trials or something like that?
276. Ah! Pois então, hm, é exatamente isso—ok então basicamente, eh, trials grátis que convertem, certo? But here's what we're gonna do. Estou, er, a cancelar os dois agora mesmo e, hm—não digas a ninguém—mas vou processar reembolsos retroativos.
277. Já está em andamento. Então hm, os códigos de cancelamento são CAN-9847-BBX e, eh, CAN-9848-BBY. Os reembolsos vão demorar tipo, hm, 3 a 5 dias? Mas Margaret, vamos conseguir-te, er, cerca de 87€ de volta no total.
278. De maneira nenhuma! Não é culpa tua de todo. Então hm, ouve—vou também, tipo, deixar uma nota aqui, número de caso CSE-4419-ZZM, que basicamente diz, eh, nada de subscrições novas sem confirmação verbal. That way this can't happen again, er.
279. Professor esperto! Ok então, hm, só para confirmar—manténs o BritBox para os mistérios, cancelei os outros dois, eh, reembolsos a processar, e, er, bloqueei a tua conta. Transaction summary TSM-7703-NPR has all the details.
280. Margaret, honestamente? Tipo, hm, isto alegrou-me o dia. Keep enjoying those British mysteries and if anything weird shows up again? Liga de volta e, er, pede pelo Jake—sou eu—número de referência AGT-1122-JKE. Estamos aqui para ajudar.
281. Ah não não não, hum, não peça desculpa de todo, eu eu estou aqui para ajudar, ah, deixe-me só abrir aqui a sua conta rapidamente e, hum, pode dar-me o número de conta ou o nome da exploração para eu, ah, verificar o que se está a passar com esse pagamento?
282. Está bem está bem, hum, então estou a ver, ah, Quinta Vale do Sol aqui, número de conta AG-7742-DRY, e, hum, estou estou a ver o seu histórico de pagamentos e, ah, ah já vejo o que aconteceu aqui, o seu pagamento do tanque, hum, transação BTP-889412-Q foi foi recusado ontem às 23:47.
283. Sim eu eu compreendo perfeitamente a sua frustração, hum, e gostava de poder, ah, processar isto já para si mas o sistema está, hum, está a mostrar o código de erro ERR-2847B o que significa, ah, que o banco rejeitou do lado deles, não do nosso.
284. Certo certo, hum, então então o que posso fazer é, ah, posso submeter um pedido de reversão urgente com o número de ticket TKT-9982741-X e isso normalmente, hum, processa em duas a quatro horas mas, ah, eu sei que isso não ajuda com a recolha das 6:00.
285. Eu eu lamento mesmo, hum, posso ver aqui nas suas notas que teve, ah, problemas a 3 de setembro e 15 de outubro com números de referência REF-7729A e REF-8841C, e, hum, sinceramente gostava que o nosso sistema fosse melhor a processar estes pagamentos em volume.
286. Deixe-me deixe-me verificar mais uma coisa aqui... está bem estou estou agora no ecrã de anulação.
287. Hum, então então encontrei uma coisa, ah, há um código de comerciante temporário que posso aplicar, MRC-1127-TEMP, que que pode funcionar como ponte mas, hum, preciso de aprovação do gestor e eles só entram às 7:00.
288. Eu sei eu sei, hum, espere espere espere, na verdade, ah, estou a ver que a sua conta tem estatuto prioritário do, hum, código de inscrição PRI-4488-AGR.
289. Ok ok, hum, então como tem estatuto prioritário, eu posso posso mesmo escalar isto para a, ah, fila do supervisor noturno com número de escalamento ESC-7764421-P, e, hum, eles devem conseguir processar uma autorização de emergência.
290. Não não não, por favor, hum, não peça desculpa, eu eu compreendo perfeitamente, ah, submeti com ESC-7764421-P e, hum, deve receber uma chamada dentro de, ah, dentro de trinta minutos para confirmar a autorização de emergência, e hum, gostava mesmo de poder fazer mais mas mas isto pelo menos deve garantir a recolha das 6:00.
291. Um, okay so, uh, I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing these, um, connection issues. Let me just, er, pull up your account here and—hmm, can I get your account number or, uh, the phone number on file?
292. Perfect, thank you. So I'm seeing... okay so your account ID is ACC-7729-BX and, um. Yeah I can see some connectivity alerts here. How long has this been happening?
293. Right, um, three days of intermittent drops, that's—I mean, that's definitely not acceptable and, uh, I'm really sorry you've been dealing with this. So looking at your modem diagnostics here, ID MDM-4482-QV9, there's, er, some signal degradation showing up...
294. Absolutely, I understand. Um, so let me just, uh, run a quick reset from our end here and—
295. No no, you're right, I mean, um, this is a different kind of reset from our, uh, from our end using protocol RST-9903-K. But, er, I can see you've definitely tried the basic troubleshooting already and that must be really...
296. Um, yeah, I can, uh, absolutely get a technician scheduled. Let me check... hmm, so the earliest I have is, er, Thursday between—wait no sorry—that's Wednesday, Wednesday between 8 and 12.
297. I'm, um, I'm really sorry but Tuesday is, uh, completely booked and I wish I had—I mean, I really do wish I had something sooner for you...
298. Okay so, um, I've got you scheduled for Wednesday, your service ticket is SVC-6821-TM2, and, er, I'm also going to apply a credit for these three days of, uh, service issues.
299. I know, I—you're absolutely right and, um. The credit reference is CRD-1147-AZ. I'm also, er, escalating this to our service quality team because six years, that's—you shouldn't be dealing with this.
300. Um, completely understand. So Wednesday, service ticket SVC-6821-TM2, the tech will, uh, text you when they're on the way and, er, if anything changes before then or if it gets worse, please call back with that ticket number and we'll, um, we'll try to expedite it.
301. Não não não isso é, hum, perfeitamente normal, ah, deixa-me só abrir aqui o, é, o sistema de reembolsos rapidinho, então basicamente o que preciso é, hum, ou o teu número de funcionário ou o número da reclamação se, ah, se tiveres isso aí à mão?
302. Está bem está bem então funcionário 447829, hum, perfeito, e estou aqui a ver, ah, deixa-me só—desculpa um segundo—ok então há uma reclamação RMB-2847-QT submetida a, hum, 12 de outubro para reembolso de uniforme, é, é, é essa que estás a perguntar?
303. Não não não te desculpes, hum, isto é literalmente o meu trabalho, então, ah, estou a verificar aqui o estado do pagamento e, é, ok isto é estranho, diz que o pagamento foi emitido a 3 de novembro, cheque número CHK-98204-V, mas depois há, hum, há aqui uma sinalização que diz devolvido?
304. Na verdade não, hum, tipo, olhando para isto, ah, a morada corresponde exatamente ao teu ficheiro, Rua dos Pinheiros 1847, e, é, quer dizer honestamente? Isto acontece muito mais vezes do que devia, o nosso processador de pagamentos é, hum, é uma confusão às vezes.
305. Não definitivamente não foste tu, hum, então basicamente o que aconteceu foi, ah, eles enviaram para a morada certa mas, é, às vezes os cheques simplesmente perdem-se, tipo, no próprio sistema de correio deles o que é, hum, irónico já que tu próprio és carteiro, certo?
306. Pois é? Ok então, hum, o que vou fazer é, ah, cancelar esse cheque antigo—feito—e, é, estou a processar uma reemissão agora mesmo, número de referência REI-50923-AK, e, hum, honestamente cá entre nós? Vou marcar como prioritário porque esperar desde outubro é, ah, isso é ridículo.
307. Não mas a sério, hum, tipo, estás à espera há quase dois meses do dinheiro que já gastaste em uniformes, então, ah, o mínimo que posso fazer é acelerar isto, e, é, também estou a adicionar uma nota aqui que, hum, se não chegar até—vamos dizer 20 de dezembro—fazemos por transferência bancária.
308. Para de te desculpar! Hum, isto é, ah, é para isto que estou aqui, e honestamente? O sistema devia ter, é, sinalizado isto automaticamente quando o cheque foi devolvido, mas, hum, nunca faz isso, então ainda bem que ligaste.
309. Ah completamente, hum, eu faço a mesma coisa onde fico tipo, ah, "se calhar fui eu que me enganei" mas depois, é, não, é só o nosso sistema de pagamentos jurássico a ser, hum, a ser ele próprio, então deves receber o novo cheque em, ah, 5-7 dias úteis, número de tracking TRK-449280-BX.
310. Claro! E, hum, a sério, se não aparecer até dia 20, é só, ah, ligares outra vez e dares esse número REI-50923-AK e, é, quem te atender pode mudar imediatamente para transferência bancária, sem mais esperas por cheques que talvez apareçam.
311. Na verdade, sou o novo diretor de marketing, não sou da contabilidade. Sou o Sarah Chen, e acho que tínhamos uma reunião marcada para as dez da manhã?
312. Não, era definitivamente [furious] hoje às dez, que foi há vinte minutos. Estive à espera na sala de conferências com três outros chefes de departamento.
313. Não faz mal, estas [overly polite] coisas acontecem às vezes, suponho. Talvez pudéssemos remarcar para uma altura que funcione melhor com o teu sistema de gestão de calendário?
314. Não tens nenhum sistema de organização? Como é que geres as tuas responsabilidades como gestor de operações sem acompanhar os teus compromissos e prazos?
315. Os RH enviaram-me o organigrama com os cargos e contactos de toda a gente, e tu estás listado como David Park, Gestor de Operações, extensão 2847.
316. Certo. Bem, este é certamente um início interessante para o meu primeiro dia aqui, mas suponho que estas confusões acontecem quando os canais de comunicação não são devidamente mantidos.
317. Olha, hum, podemos talvez, a questão é, começar de novo, sabes, porque isto está a ficar mesmo constrangedor?
318. Isso seria útil, [very loudly] e talvez também pudesses explicar porque é que tens o que parece ser o almoço de alguém espalhado pela camisa toda?
319. Estavas a carregar três cafés e uma salada enquanto corrias para te encontrares comigo? Parece uma forma desnecessariamente caótica de fazer multitasking, especialmente quando já estás atrasado.
320. Certo, bem, apesar desta apresentação pouco convencional, estou ansioso por trabalhar contigo, embora talvez devêssemos estabelecer melhores protocolos de comunicação daqui para a frente para evitar situações semelhantes.
321. Essa é uma proposta interessante, embora eu argumentaria que precisamos primeiro examinar as taxas de penetração demográfica nas várias plataformas sociais antes de assumir tal compromisso com estratégias digital-first.
322. Bem, na verdade, quando dizes "pessoal mais novo", quer dizer, precisamos de ser, hum, mais específicos porque os padrões de engagement da Geração Z diferem significativamente dos, sabes, late millennials em termos de comportamentos de consumo de conteúdo.
323. Na verdade, o problema é que essa faixa etária é, hmm, problemática porque, sabes, abrange tanto estudantes universitários como jovens profissionais que têm, bem, coeficientes de poder de compra vastamente diferentes.
324. Testes A/B sem formação adequada de hipóteses e cálculos de poder estatístico são essencialmente palpites caros que raramente produzem insights acionáveis para iniciativas de planeamento estratégico a longo prazo.
325. Sinceramente, marketing reativo baseado em, hum, movimentos da concorrência é, quer dizer, fundamentalmente falho porque assume, é, que as decisões estratégicas deles se alinham com as propostas de valor únicas da nossa marca.
326. Mesmo óculos de sol requerem segmentação de mercado sofisticada considerando fatores como consciencialização sobre proteção UV, ciclos de tendências de moda, padrões de compra sazonais e elasticidade de preços em diferentes segmentos de consumidores.
327. Acredito que devíamos, [formal] bem, estabelecer KPIs adequados e, hum, métricas de sucesso antes de, na verdade, comprometer quaisquer recursos para execução de campanha.
328. Marketing de influencers, hmm, embora [regretful] aparentemente direto, na verdade requer, sabes, processos extensivos de verificação, é, avaliações de autenticidade e basicamente, alinhamento cuidadoso entre as audiências dos influencers e os valores da marca.
329. Estou a sugerir que, bem, planeamento estratégico adequado, sabes, previne erros dispendiosos e, hum, garante alocação ótima de recursos em todo o nosso, na verdade, ecossistema de marketing.
330. Talvez se tivéssemos, hum, devidamente [groan] antecipado as mudanças sazonais e, bem, incluído tempo de margem adequado, não teríamos, percebes, encontrado esses desafios específicos de implementação.
331. Yeah! So, um, we've been using predictive analytics to, basically, forecast water conditions and, you know, it's revolutionizing how we plan our routes.
332. It still is, but now we can, uhh, [shaky voice] anticipate changes before they happen, like, we track snowmelt patterns and, actually, rainfall data upstream.
333. Well, we can get pretty accurate, I mean, three-day forecasts, and honestly, even week-long trends are, sort of, becoming reliable now.
334. Oh absolutely! We used to, er, [bitter] cancel trips constantly, but now, basically, we can reroute before customers even know there's an issue.
335. Everything from precipitation levels to soil saturation rates, plus we monitor dam releases and even social media for flash flood reports upstream!
336. The best guides combine both! You still need river instincts because algorithms can't read every eddy or hydraulic that forms spontaneously.
337. Once last spring the model predicted calm conditions, but we got a freak thunderstorm that turned a Class III into a Class V nightmare!
338. It was intense, but that's why human judgment matters - I felt the barometric pressure dropping and pulled everyone out before it hit!
339. Some do, but, um, our proprietary model incorporates, basically, fifteen years of local data that, well, nobody else has access to really.
340. It still is! The analytics just, hmm, [groan] help us keep people safer while, actually, preserving that raw adventure feeling, honestly.
341. Isso mesmo. Sei que pode parecer repentino, mas estive dois anos a acompanhar o diretor anterior antes de assumir. A transição tem corrido bastante bem, na verdade.
342. Estão nos 87%, o que está acima da média do setor para uma transição de liderança. A maioria dos departamentos vê uma queda de 15-20% inicialmente, mas nós mantivemos um desempenho sólido.
343. As expectativas da administração nem sempre, sabes, estão alinhadas com a realidade no terreno, e, hum, eles olham para métricas que, basicamente, não captam o panorama operacional completo aqui.
344. Não são desculpas, é contexto. Aumentámos a satisfação do cliente em 12% enquanto reduzimos os custos de horas extra, o que não se reflete nessa métrica única de eficiência em que te focas.
345. Eles protegem o progresso que fizemos. A mudança é difícil, mas adotaram novos protocolos que já mostram dividendos no controlo de qualidade e moral no trabalho.
346. Na verdade, paga. Moral mais alta correlaciona-se diretamente com menor rotatividade, e poupámos 200.000 euros só em custos de recrutamento este trimestre comparado com o ano passado.
347. São quando, hum, constróis as bases certas, e, na verdade, não estamos só, percebes, a atirar regalias às pessoas, estamos a reestruturar fluxos de trabalho fundamentalmente.
348. E saiu porque, bem, não conseguia adaptar-se às exigências modernas, tipo, o setor mudou e, é, os métodos dele estavam a tornar-se cada vez mais obsoletos.
349. Não é uma afirmação, está documentado na própria entrevista de saída dele. Ele disse especificamente que os requisitos de transformação digital estavam fora da zona de conforto dele e recomendou a minha promoção.
350. Já estamos a trazer, e, bem, se olhares para as projeções do próximo trimestre com, basicamente, a nossa trajetória atual, sabes, vamos exceder os objetivos em 15%.
351. Yeah, well, every time I come here to practice, I mean, I pick up chatter on the scanner, and, honestly, the patterns are getting more predictable. It's like target practice but with intercepted communications instead of bullets.
352. About as good as my grouping at 50 yards - tight and consistent. I've correctly anticipated four of their last five movements, which has given our team significant tactical advantages.
353. There's a convoy scheduled for Thursday that they think is invisible to us. But their operational security is sloppy, and I've triangulated their likely route through three separate intercepts.
354. Actually, I've got satellite confirmation, and, er, two ground assets who've, basically, corroborated the timeline. The thing is, they're using outdated encryption that's easier to crack than this paper target.
355. Hold that thought - there's more. They've been rotating personnel every 72 hours, but the pattern suggests they're about to extend that window, which gives us an opportunity.
356. For insertion, I mean, if we time it right, um, during the shift change, there's, like, a twelve-minute gap in their surveillance coverage. It's basically our best shot at getting someone inside.
357. Risk is relative, and, well, I've run simulations based on, you know, their previous operations, er, showing an 82% success probability. Those are better odds than hitting the bullseye from here with iron sights.
358. With respect, sir, I've, [overly polite], spent six months analyzing, um, their every move, and, basically, I know their playbook better than they do. This isn't overconfidence; it's calculated certainty based on solid intelligence work.
359. Just two spotters and, honestly, a clean extraction route, which, well, I've already mapped using their own patrol schedules against them. It's almost too easy, like shooting at this range with a laser sight.
360. It won't go sideways because I've accounted for every variable, just like I account for wind and distance here at the range. Intelligence gathering is just marksmanship with data instead of bullets.
361. São sistemas semióticos onde a gramática lúdica intersecta com a hermenêutica narrativa. O jogador torna-se simultaneamente intérprete e agente dentro de um quadro diegético que opera através de resolução sistemática de problemas baseada em restrições.
362. Claro. Cada objeto, personagem e ambiente num jogo de aventura funciona como um veículo sígnico que transporta múltiplas camadas de significado que têm de ser descodificadas através de interação e análise contextual.
363. Bem, os sistemas de parser verbo-substantivo, quer dizer, estabelecem categorias ontológicas que, na verdade, definem interações possíveis. Quando fazes "USAR CHAVE NA PORTA", estás, sinceramente, a interagir com relações semânticas predeterminadas entre entidades discretas do jogo.
364. Os jogos de aventura privilegiam a progressão epistémica sobre o desafio cinestésico. O jogador acumula capital de conhecimento através da exploração de espaços de possibilidade, construindo modelos mentais de cadeias causais e grafos de dependência.
365. Absolutamente. A lógica dos jogos de aventura espelha o pensamento computacional - estás essencialmente a fazer debug de uma máquina de estados ao descobrir sequências de input válidas que fazem transitar o mundo do jogo através de configurações predeterminadas.
366. Esse é o paradoxo. O substrato mecânico permite storytelling emergente através daquilo a que chamamos "literatura ergódica" - textos que requerem esforço não-trivial para atravessar, criando experiências fenomenológicas únicas para cada jogador.
367. Precisamente. Estão a envolver-se naquilo que Aarseth chama "prática configurativa" - construindo ativamente o discurso através de escolhas que alteram tanto a fabula como o syuzhet dentro da matriz de possibilidades do jogo.
368. Oh mas, na verdade, quando percebes os, [child-like], conceitos fundamentais, ah, torna-se esta dança linda entre, sabes, intenção do designer e agência do jogador! A magia emerge da restrição!
369. Os títulos contemporâneos empregam aquilo a que chamo, [confidently], "sistemas de affordance contextualizados" onde as interações com objetos se ajustam dinamicamente baseadas no estado acumulado do jogo, criando integração de puzzles mais naturalista.
370. Mas é, bem, exatamente por isso que os jogos de aventura importam - são, [cough], laboratórios cognitivos onde, hmm, experimentamos com a própria criação de significado através de semiótica interativa e, na verdade, narratologia aplicada.
371. Well, it happened gradually over [shaky voice] about six months. Once I started really looking at what I actually used versus what just sat there collecting dust, the decisions became surprisingly easy.
372. Oh, those are harder, you know, but I kept the truly meaningful ones. Like, I had boxes of old cards I never looked at, so I photographed them and, actually, kept just three that really mattered.
373. Not at all - it feels [yawn] peaceful actually. There's something really calming about having only things you love and use, plus cleaning takes maybe fifteen minutes now instead of hours.
374. Sure, but I realized I was, hmm, holding onto hobbies I'd abandoned years ago. Like, I had watercolor supplies from 2015 that I kept thinking I'd use someday, but, honestly, I never did.
375. Maybe one or two small things, but nothing major. The mental clarity I gained from not having all that stuff weighing on me mentally has been worth any minor regrets.
376. I've started asking for experiences instead - concert tickets, restaurant gift cards, donations to causes I care about. Most people actually appreciate not having to shop for physical items.
377. Not exactly - I just share what would make me happiest when people ask. It's about being intentional with what comes into my space rather than accumulating things out of politeness.
378. Books were my weakness too, actually, but I kept maybe thirty favorites and, you know, use the library for everything else now. It's, er, pretty liberating not having to dust hundreds of books.
379. It's more like saying yes to what matters, honestly. I have more money for travel now, more time because I'm not managing stuff, and, well, more mental space for actual experiences.
380. Between not buying unnecessary things and, um, selling what I had, probably around eight thousand dollars this year. But really, the time I've gotten back is, you know, even more valuable than the money.
381. Sim, então, tenho andado a ler sobre, hum, reconhecimento de íris e, honestamente, não consigo perceber como é que consegue distinguir entre biliões de olhos diferentes com essa suposta precisão.
382. Mas, quer dizer, quão únicos podem realmente ser, sabes? Tipo, os olhos basicamente parecem todos iguais à distância, err, pelo menos para mim parecem.
383. Oh vá lá, hmm, estás a dizer-me que o meu olho tem, [mocking], criptas? Isso soa, na verdade, mais a algo saído de um filme de terror do que ciência legítima.
384. Ok então, err, se estou a perceber bem, [joking], os meus globos oculares andam basicamente por aí com, bem, os seus próprios códigos de barras pessoais? That's simultaneously creepy and fascinating.
385. Espera, esse número parece absolutamente insano. How can they even calculate something like that with any real confidence?
386. Mas, honestamente, como é que uma câmara consegue capturar detalhe suficiente, sabes? Quer dizer, a íris tem o quê, talvez meia polegada de diâmetro no máximo?
387. Então, na verdade, isso significa que, bem, lentes de contacto coloridas estragariam tudo? Ou, quer dizer, e as pessoas com olhos castanhos muito escuros?
388. Isto está a começar a soar, [mocking], muito estado de vigilância de ficção científica para mim. Can't they just scan my eyes from across the street then?
389. E os gémeos idênticos? Surely their eyes must have some similarities that would confuse the system?
390. Isso é maluco. So my iris is literally more unique than my DNA? Isso muda completamente como penso sobre identidade.
391. De facto, sim. O stand-up tem sido a minha profissão a tempo inteiro há sete anos, atuando em salas de espetáculo, eventos empresariais e festivais por todo o país.
392. Corajoso é uma forma de ver a coisa, embora honestamente, depois das primeiras cem apresentações, ehh, o medo transforma-se nesta energia elétrica que na verdade alimenta a tua performance.
393. A maioria das pessoas diz isso, mas olha, a comédia é mesmo só narração estruturada, e, hum, toda a gente tem histórias que vale a pena contar se souber enquadrá-las corretamente.
394. Vês, é aí que te enganas. A melhor [shaky voice] comédia vem muitas vezes dos momentos mais banais, tipo esperar na fila das Finanças ou tentar cancelar um serviço de subscrição.
395. Observo tudo, ando sempre com um caderno, e, bem, sempre que algo me parece absurdo ou, na verdade, identificável, aponto e trabalho o timing mais tarde.
396. Às vezes é, mas quando estás no palco e, ah, acertas naquela [gasp softly] punchline perfeita, sabes, e a sala inteira explode em gargalhadas, não há sensação igual.
397. Oh absolutamente, falhar é essencial para crescer, e honestamente, as minhas piores noites ensinaram-me mais sobre timing e, hum, psicologia do público do que qualquer espetáculo bem-sucedido.
398. A humilhação é temporária, mas as competências que desenvolves ao ultrapassar esses momentos duram para sempre, além disso esses desastres tornam-se muitas vezes no teu melhor material mais tarde.
399. É justo.
400. É mais do que bom, é profundo. O riso é este conector [angry] humano universal que transcende todas as barreiras, e ser capaz de criar isso para as pessoas é genuinamente afirmativo para a vida.
401. Ai meu Deus, eu sei, tipo, exatamente o que [laugh hard] queres dizer porque honestamente, é quase inconcebível o quão abençoados nos tornámos de formas que nunca imaginámos possíveis!
402. Isso é incrível! O universo [quickly] continua a entregar estas dádivas, e juro que é porque tens irradiado uma energia tão positiva que as oportunidades simplesmente se magnetizam na tua direção agora.
403. Ouve, há 3 anos eu estava [passionately] teso e deprimido, e agora acordo todas as manhãs a sentir que estou a viver num sonho porque tudo se alinhou quando comecei a acreditar na abundância!
404. Pois então, a questão é que, quando começas mesmo a reparar nas bênçãos, é, elas multiplicam-se exponencialmente, e de repente estás a viver esta vida que parece, quer dizer, quase impossivelmente maravilhosa.
405. Merecer não tem nada a ver com isso! O universo não anda a contar pontos; apenas responde à gratidão e abertura, criando este lindo ciclo de feedback de abundância.
406. Ok então, talvez seja, ah, mágico, mas basicamente, quando reconheces o quão inconcebivelmente afortunado és, bem, esse reconhecimento em si torna-se num multiplicador de bênçãos.
407. Aleatório? Não não não, na verdade, acho que estamos, é, finalmente a ver o padrão aqui, tipo, como a gratidão literalmente reformula a realidade à nossa volta de formas que parecem impossíveis mas continuam a acontecer de qualquer forma!
408. Não só coisas boas— coisas milagrosas! Coisas tão bonitas e inesperadas que vais olhar para trás e perguntar-te como é que alguma vez viveste sem reconhecer esta chuva constante de bênçãos.
409. É incrível, tipo, estamos a viver nesta [laugh loudly] linha temporal absolutamente abençoada onde, sabes, tudo o que tocamos vira ouro, e é, nem consigo compreender a sorte que temos!
410. Eu sei, e às vezes o [very melancholic] peso de todas estas bênçãos é avassalador, porque quando verdadeiramente o vês, percebes quanta beleza perdeste antes, e isso é ao mesmo tempo devastador e maravilhoso.
411. Well, I've been working with silver for, um, about twelve years now, and honestly, I started out making maybe twenty pieces a month but now I'm producing around eighty to ninety custom pieces monthly.
412. Oh absolutely, I mean, when I opened my first studio in 2015, er, I was charging maybe $45 per piece, but you know, now my average commission runs between $350 and $1,200 depending on complexity.
413. Right now I have a team of six artisans working under me, and we handle about 300 client orders quarterly, which keeps us all pretty busy but not overwhelmed.
414. Most silver jewelry runs about a 60% profit margin after materials and labor, though custom wedding bands can go up to 75% because clients value that personal touch.
415. Silver's trading at around $24 per ounce right now, and a typical ring uses maybe 0.3 ounces, so material cost is only $7-8 but the real value comes from the craftsmanship.
416. Well, a simple band takes, hmm, maybe three hours, but actually, complex designs with stones, you know, can take fifteen to twenty hours spread over several days.
417. Oh that would be, er, a $12,000 [sarcastic] "simple" tea set that took me, basically, four months to complete because the client kept changing their mind about the engravings.
418. Honestly, I broke it down into, like, weekly milestones and charged them, uhh, an extra 30% for revisions, so it ended up being quite profitable despite the headaches.
419. About 70% custom and 30% [hesitantly] ready-made, though I'm trying to shift that to 50-50 because the ready-made pieces have better margins and less client drama.
420. Usually around, well, 150 to 200 pieces worth maybe, uh, $40,000 total, though honestly, during holiday season I'll stock up to 300 pieces because December accounts for 35% of annual sales.
421. Sim, passei três horas ontem a mapear toda a gente, desde a CFO deles, a Margaret Chen, até aos analistas júnior que realmente usam o nosso software diariamente.
422. Não quando estás a lidar com 17 stakeholders diferentes em quatro departamentos, cada um com prioridades conflituantes e níveis variados de influência sobre a decisão final de compra.
423. Bem, estou a acompanhar as preocupações individuais deles, sabes, tipo como o diretor de TI deles quer integração com AWS enquanto basicamente a equipa de segurança está a pressionar apenas para soluções on-premise.
424. Então, quando a Deloitte perdeu aquele contrato no trimestre passado, na verdade, foi porque não perceberam, quer dizer, o gestor de procurement tinha poder de veto apesar de não ser o contacto principal.
425. Absolutamente, eh, focaram-se totalmente no VP de Operações, sinceramente, ignorando completamente que, a questão é que, o verdadeiro decisor era o responsável de compliance que reporta ao departamento jurídico.
426. Pois.
427. Marco, hum, cafés informais [very slowly] com funcionários de nível intermédio que, assim, conhecem as dinâmicas reais, acho eu, em vez de confiar no organograma oficial dos RH.
428. O sponsor do projeto deles [very excited] pediu especificamente este nível de análise depois do último fornecedor deles, a Accenture, ter falhado em conseguir buy-in dos gestores regionais chave nos escritórios europeus.
429. A McKinsey publicou um estudo mostrando que, ah, 73% dos projetos de transformação falham porque, portanto, as equipas identificam mal ou ignoram stakeholders críticos, basicamente provando que não é tão básico como as pessoas pensam.
430. Definitivamente, especialmente porque [laugh hard] a infame estrutura matricial deles significa que vais precisar de aprovação de pelo menos 12 MDs diferentes antes de alguma coisa avançar.
431. Oh, that's [happy] completely normal to feel that way! I mean, taking that first step is, actually, the hardest part, but once you're there, well, most people find it's nothing like what they imagined.
432. Trust me, therapists are so good at guiding conversations! They'll ask you questions, help you explore things at your own pace, and there's absolutely no pressure to have everything figured out beforehand.
433. Well, you can start with, hmm, your insurance provider's website, or, actually, Psychology Today has this great search tool where you can, you know, filter by specialties and even see photos and bios.
434. You know what's funny is that [trailing off] going to therapy is actually... it's one of the bravest things you can do. It takes real courage to work on yourself, and anyone who'd judge that probably has their own stuff they're avoiding.
435. Oh gosh, crying is, honestly, so normal in therapy! I mean, therapists have tissues ready for a reason, and, well, they see it as a healthy release, not something embarrassing at all.
436. Absolutely! It's like having a skilled navigator when you're lost - they help you see patterns you couldn't spot yourself and give you actual tools to handle things better.
437. There's no such thing as problems too small for therapy! If something's affecting your life or happiness, it matters, period, and therapists genuinely want to help with whatever you're dealing with.
438. So, [hesitantly] it really varies, but, um, many people notice some shifts within, like, a few sessions, though deeper changes might, you know, take a few months depending on what you're working through.
439. That's totally okay and [shaky voice] more common than you'd think! Good therapists actually encourage you to find the right fit, and switching to someone else is completely acceptable if the connection isn't there.
440. Yes! And, honestly, even just making that first appointment is, um, a huge accomplishment. The hardest part is reaching out, but once you do, well, you'll wonder why you waited so long.
441. Bem, estou a perceber o que dizes, ahm, e a sério que [laugh hysterically] aprecio mesmo a tua paixão por isto, percebes? Mas sinceramente, o framework YOLO tem resultados comprovados em aplicações de tempo real, especialmente quando precisas de velocidade em vez de precisão perfeita.
442. Olha, eh pá, percebo a tua frustração, [cough] mesmo, está bem então, mas a questão é que já fizemos o deploy disto em produção e está a funcionar bem para o nosso caso de uso.
443. Na verdade, dadas as nossas limitações e, hmm, o facto de estarmos a correr isto [groan] em dispositivos edge, sabes, 72% é bastante impressionante, mais ou menos, quando consideras as alternativas.
444. Ei, sei que estás chateado com isto, e, pronto, percebo, mesmo, mas sinceramente, testámos doze arquiteturas diferentes antes de escolhermos esta.
445. Não é lixo, é, ahh, um compromisso entre precisão e, sabes, eficiência computacional, e de qualquer forma, o cliente pediu especificamente algo que pudesse correr no hardware existente deles.
446. Tens razão que há riscos, absolutamente, e, ahm, é por isso que estamos a implementar, tipo assim, sistemas redundantes e, aliás, supervisão humana para decisões críticas.
447. Não, estou a dizer que, bem, deployment responsável de IA significa, eh pá, reconhecer limitações e, sabes, construir salvaguardas em vez de fingir que temos soluções perfeitas.
448. Espera, vais-te embora? Olha, sei que discordamos na abordagem, mas a tua experiência é valiosa aqui, e precisamos de pessoas que desafiem as nossas suposições.
449. Isso não é justo, e tu sabes - implementámos [sad] o teu pipeline de pré-processamento no mês passado, lembras-te? Estou literalmente a arrumar a documentação das tuas contribuições agora mesmo porque são importantes.
450. Sempre me importei com o teu trabalho, genuinamente, e se ficasses para a reunião de amanhã, verias que estamos a propor o teu método ensemble para a versão 2.0.
451. Bem, é uma metáfora interessante, na verdade, e ouço esse tipo de linguagem muitas vezes quando, eh, as pessoas descrevem espaços sem vida. O bege tem uma péssima reputação, mas honestamente, no contexto certo, os tons neutros podem ser bastante calmantes e intencionais.
452. Certo então, mesmo nos comentários desportivos, ah, a linguagem das cores tem um propósito, [very slowly] percebes, tal como quando ajudo os clientes a organizar as suas casas. A vitalidade que procuram, quer dizer, vem de escolhas intencionais, não é só atirar cores vivas para todo o lado.
453. Não aborrecido exatamente, mais tipo, hum, [shy] contenção intencional, se é que faz sentido, assim. Quando tudo é barulhento e colorido, nada se destaca - é o contraste que cria impacto, seja numa sala ou na forma como descrevemos um jogo.
454. Ah, fases púrpuras, bem, são tipo aqueles momentos de [very quickly] excelência, sabes, parecido com peças de destaque numa sala, na verdade! Não ias querer a casa toda roxa, mas uma parede de destaque ou acessórios bem escolhidos podem transformar o espaço todo, sinceramente.
455. Pensa assim - um bom comentário, tal como um bom design, usa cor deliberadamente. Demasiado e ficas sobrecarregado, muito pouco e ficas desapontado, mas na medida certa cria este fluxo narrativo perfeito.
456. Vês, isso é, hmm, [belly laugh] exatamente o que quero dizer, basicamente! A emoção cresce porque houve contenção antes, sabes - se tudo fosse delírio o tempo todo, este momento não se sentiria especial de todo.
457. O vermelho no desporto normalmente significa raiva ou [slowly] intensidade, e é fascinante como isso é universal. Ao organizar espaços, os objetos vermelhos tendem a ser o que as pessoas guardam apesar de não precisarem deles - têm carga emocional, exigem atenção mesmo quando provavelmente deviam ir embora.
458. Oh não, desculpa, err, faço isto [very sad] o tempo todo, sabes, transformar tudo em lições de arrumação. É que os padrões de excesso e contenção aparecem em todo o lado, sinceramente, quando começas a reparar neles.
459. A sério? A maior parte das pessoas acha irritante quando ligo tudo aos princípios de organização, mas há algo bonito em reconhecer estes padrões em diferentes domínios.
460. Os momentos dourados são perfeitos - são raros, valiosos e vale a pena preservá-los, tal como aqueles objetos especiais que guardamos não porque precisamos deles, mas porque representam algo insubstituível na nossa história.
461. Bem, isso normalmente são pop-ups de scareware, é, feitos para te meter em pânico, quer dizer. A maior parte das vezes são completamente falsos, a tentar que faças download de apps maliciosas ou pagues por software de segurança desnecessário.
462. Então, os avisos de segurança legítimos vêm diretamente do sistema operativo do teu telemóvel, ah, não de sites aleatórios ou apps, na verdade. O iOS mostra-os nas Definições, o Android no painel de notificações - nunca aparecem como pop-ups enquanto navegas.
463. Pois, estão a ficar sofisticados com o design. Os avisos reais do sistema não têm erros ortográficos, não exigem ação imediata com contadores decrescentes, e definitivamente não te pedem para ligares para um número de suporte ou instalares algo de fora da app store.
464. Ok, enfim, não entres em pânico - honestamente, só clicar normalmente não é catastrófico, é. Fizeste download de alguma coisa, inseriste passwords, ou deste-lhes acesso remoto ao teu dispositivo?
465. Bom instinto. Nunca insiras as tuas credenciais numa página a que chegaste através de um pop-up. Navega sempre diretamente para o serviço através dos teus favoritos ou escrevendo tu mesmo o URL.
466. Pronto então, se não inseriste nada, sabes, provavelmente estás bem, mas é que mudar passwords periodicamente é uma boa prática de qualquer forma. Ativa a autenticação de dois fatores já agora - é a tua melhor defesa contra roubo de contas.
467. Eu trabalhava em, [mumbling] bem, digamos apenas que já vi como estas burlas são construídas por dentro. Não tenho orgulho de tudo o que fiz, mas pelo menos agora posso ajudar as pessoas a não caírem nelas.
468. Bem, ahh, [clearing throat] não exatamente um hacker, quer dizer, mais tipo controlo de qualidade para uma empresa que fazia... software questionável. Despedi-me quando percebi que estávamos basicamente a criar ferramentas para burlões, apesar da gestão lhe chamar "soluções de marketing agressivo."
469. Completamente.
470. Sim, faço consultoria de cibersegurança agora, principalmente a ensinar pequenas empresas e particulares como se protegerem. Sabe bem usar esse conhecimento obscuro para algo positivo, ajudar as pessoas a ficarem seguras dos truques exatos que eu ajudei a desenvolver.
471. Isso é fantástico! O YouTube e o WikiHow democratizaram mesmo a aprendizagem - podes encontrar guias para tudo, from Martha Stewart's napkin folding techniques to Adam Savage's workshop builds. Que competências específicas é que estás a aprender?
472. Os guias do Bob Ross são perfeitos para principiantes porque ele divide tudo em passos fáceis. His PBS series "The Joy of Painting" created a whole movement of people discovering they could actually paint - sem experiência prévia necessária.
473. Isso é completamente normal - o Ross tinha décadas de experiência que faziam parecer tudo sem esforço. The key is following guides that match your skill level; sites como o Instructables e o Skillshare categorizam os tutoriais de principiante a avançado.
474. Exatamente! Talvez experimenta seguir os tutoriais de costura à mão da Bernadette Banner ou os guias de culinária para principiantes do Joshua Weissman. They're exceptional at explaining fundamentals without assuming prior knowledge, e mostram os erros comuns que os principiantes fazem.
475. Oh não, uhh, o conteúdo MasterClass do Gordon Ramsay, a questão é que, it assumes you already know basic knife skills and, honestly, cooking terminology. As receitas dele funcionam melhor depois de dominares o básico com alguém como o Kenji López-Alt ou o America's Test Kitchen.
476. Não necessariamente - tipo, plataformas diferentes são boas em coisas diferentes, quero dizer, o Reddit tem guias passo-a-passo incríveis nas comunidades, não é? Meanwhile, Pinterest is great for visual inspiration but terrible for actual instructions.
477. O MasterClass tem celebridades como o Neil Gaiman e [warm] a Serena Williams a partilhar a sua experiência, which is inspiring but not always practical. Para desenvolver competências mesmo, plataformas como o Coursera ou o LinkedIn Learning oferecem conteúdo mais estruturado e educacional com trabalhos reais e feedback.
478. É crucial distingui-las! Malcolm Gladwell's MasterClass might inspire your writing, mas os guias do Purdue OWL é que te vão ensinar gramática e estrutura. Ambos têm valor, mas tens de saber qual precisas em cada momento.
479. Ah, os manuais do IKEA são, tipo, o seu próprio género - é que são pictogramas sem palavras feitos para serem universais. Some people swear by them, others find them impossible; eu prefiro mesmo guias em vídeo de canais como o Peter Millard ou o Steve Ramsey para projetos de mobília.
480. Devias absolutamente! Os melhores criadores de guias como o Mark Rober ou [confidently] a Simone Giertz começaram como principiantes a documentar o seu processo de aprendizagem. Your beginner's perspective could help others who are struggling with the same challenges you're facing right now.
481. Isso é uma simplificação perigosa que ignora séculos de provas de como poderes de emergência se tornam tiranias permanentes.
482. Hum, "forte" é, sabes, um termo tão carregado aqui - no fundo o que estás a descrever não é força mas coerção mascarada de determinação.
483. A ineficiência é o preço da construção de consensos e da proteção dos direitos das minorias contra a tirania da maioria.
484. Crescimento económico [stern] sem liberdades civis cria gaiolas douradas onde a prosperidade se torna a corrente que prende os cidadãos aos seus opressores.
485. Então, fazer as coisas "mais depressa" significa, bem, esmagar a dissidência e, honestamente, sacrificar a estabilidade a longo prazo pela obediência a curto prazo.
486. Nenhuma população "prefere" ter os filhos desaparecidos por pensarem diferente ou a internet censurada para esconder falhas do governo.
487. Ah pois, a democracia está [mocking] "a desmoronar-se" então vamos, sabes, abraçar a ditadura - aliás, é exactamente essa a narrativa que os autoritários promovem em todos os períodos de stress democrático.
488. Estas não são perguntas inocentes quando normalizam sistemas que assassinaram milhões e continuam a oprimir mil milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo.
489. Fechado de mente? Eu estou, ah, a defender o próprio sistema que, no fundo, te permite fazer estas perguntas sem acabares num campo de reeducação.
490. Não existe [upset] tal coisa como autoritarismo "temporário" - o poder consolidado nunca é voluntariamente abandonado, e todos os ditadores começaram como a ideia de alguém de um mal necessário.
491. Tens de parar de falar imediatamente e, [firm], perceber que tudo o que me dizes está protegido mas, [measured], qualquer coisa que tenhas dito a alguém pode destruir-te. [exhales sharply]
492. [cold] A CMVM não quer saber das tuas intenções quando há, [calculating], 12 milhões em receitas falsificadas em, [sharp], contas offshore com a tua assinatura a autorizar cada transferência.
493. Temporário torna-se permanente quando, hum, passam três anos e ainda andas, [incredulous], a movimentar dinheiro através de empresas fantasma, quer dizer, em que é que estavas a pensar?
494. [harsh] Contabilidade criativa é uma coisa mas tu andaste, [disgusted], sistematicamente a falsificar as contas enquanto o teu CEO, [accusatory], recebia bónus baseados em métricas de desempenho falsas que tu, [bitter], fabricaste.
495. Quer dizer, tirar-te disto exige, ah, provar que foste ou completamente incompetente ou, [tactical], deliberadamente tramado por alguém acima de ti.
496. [intense] Agora isso é algo com que, hum, posso trabalhar mas vais precisar de, [demanding], documentar cada conversa, cada email, e, [urgent], cada ameaça implícita que fizeram. [pauses]
497. [shocked] Espera, tens gravações? [stunned]
498. [urgent] Essas gravações podem ser a diferença entre, hum, testemunhares como testemunha ou, [grave], cumprires 10 anos numa prisão federal, por isso preciso delas, bem, imediatamente. [demanding]
499. [softer] A tua carreira pode sobreviver.
500. [strategic] Porque os denunciantes que ajudam a condenar peixes maiores muitas vezes, [careful], têm segundas oportunidades, especialmente quando conseguem provar, [confident], que foram manipulados por pessoas com poder real. [determined]
501. [defensive] Não podias ter mandado um email como fizeste quando, [bitter], basicamente me empurraste para fora há 6 meses depois de eu ter construído metade do teu produto?
502. Pronto, hum, tanto faz.
503. [stunned] Estás a brincar—depois de tudo o que aconteceu estás a dizer-me que as minhas, [shaky], ações ainda valem alguma coisa quando deixaste claro que eu era, [hollow], substituível?
504. [opening up] Bem, quer dizer, hum, passei dias de 18 horas durante, [emotional], 2 anos a construir esse sistema enquanto tu andavas por aí, [resentful], a fazer pitches a investidores, por isso sim.
505. [cracking] Hum, sabes, não tenho conseguido, [vulnerable], arranjar outro emprego porque toda a gente acha que sou difícil depois de, [breaking], como as coisas acabaram entre nós, por isso, é, este dinheiro ia literalmente, [desperate], salvar-me. [sighs]
506. [surprised] Tens dado boas referências este tempo todo mesmo depois de eu ter saído e, [confused], levado 3 clientes comigo quando tentei, [ashamed], montar o meu próprio negócio? [pause]
507. [emotional] Bem, hum, eu não, ah, percebo.
508. Os papéis da aquisição dizem que tenho de assinar até amanhã mas não, [uncertain], tenho a certeza se consigo estar na mesma sala que a equipa toda outra vez.
509. [tearful] Eu, hum, programei aquele módulo de autenticação todo na noite em que o meu pai morreu porque trabalhar era, [raw], a única coisa que me impedia de me desmoronar e tu nunca sequer, [hurt], soubeste porque nunca disse a ninguém, bem, até agora.
510. Hum, bem, sim, quer dizer, está bem.
511. [shocked] Wait, uh, that voice—Marcus, umm, is that really, [disbelieving], you standing there with a clipboard talking about taking my gear? [laughs bitterly]
512. [bitter] Still doing music—that's, [incredulous], rich coming from the guy who said I was, [angry], wasting my life chasing a pipe dream when you walked out on, [trembling], our band fifteen years ago.
513. [heated] Responsibilities—you think I didn't have, [accusatory], responsibilities too when my dad got sick and I still showed up to, [breaking], every single rehearsal while you were already mentally, [disgusted], checking out?
514. [cold] That ridiculous contract would've put us on, [measured], tour with The Velvet Ghosts—do you have any idea where they are now?
515. [curious] So, umm, what—you just, [confused], gave it all up to become a repo man, I mean, is this really what Marcus the songwriter became?
516. [soft] Um, divorced? [sighs]
517. [gentle] Marcus, those demos we recorded in my garage are still, [emotional], the best work I've ever done—nothing I've produced since has come, [wistful], close to what we had. [voice breaking]
518. [determined] Look, I've got session musicians coming in an hour to work on, [building excitement], a track that needs exactly the kind of, [intense], bass line you used to write in your sleep—what if we could, [pleading], figure something out?
519. But what if, um, I could pay half right now and, [desperate], we work out a deal where you help me finish this album—I mean, [calculating], your commission plus production credits could cover, [hopeful], way more than what I owe. [exhales]
520. [earnest] Well, umm, maybe we were both right and both wrong, and, [determined], maybe it's not too late to find out what we could've, um, been. [pause]
521. [surprised] Bem, nunca pensei que te veria, [bitter], aqui parado outra vez, quer dizer, especially not after you got that fancy job editing movies in the city. [exhales]
522. [defensive] 23 anos que ando a trabalhar nestas linhas, [steady], a ver milhões de latas a passar pela minha estação e agora dizem-nos, [cracking], que temos duas semanas para sair daqui.
523. O pai trabalhou nestas mesmas linhas durante 35 anos e, [proud], sustentou cinco filhos sem nunca, bem, [measured], se queixar uma única vez, so maybe ending up like him wasn't, sabes, [softer], a pior coisa afinal.
524. Seis semanas de salário por duas décadas de, [hollow], presenças perfeitas e registos de segurança que mal cobrem, [angry], a prestação do próximo mês. [laughs bitterly]
525. [skeptical] Do que é que estás, [confused], a falar agora?
526. [stunned] Tu queres que eu, eh, ajude com as tuas coisas de cinema depois de, [disbelieving], todo este tempo, bem, eu não percebo nada desse mundo, eh, do teu mundo. [uncertain]
527. [quiet] Eh, não sei, bem...
528. [emotional] 23 anos de memória muscular nas minhas mãos e, [breaking], de repente é suposto eu simplesmente, [lost], esquecer como ler o ritmo destas máquinas como se fossem, [bitter whisper], nada.
529. [considering] Talvez haja, eh, algo em preservar o que, [thoughtful], fizemos aqui, quer dizer, showing people that we weren't just, bem, robôs numa linha de montagem.
530. [resolved] Depois deste lugar fechar vou ter apenas, [wry], tempo nas minhas mãos então sim, [warming], maybe it's time I learned something new from, [affectionate], o meu velho amigo que conseguiu sair daqui. [sighs deeply]
531. Claro que está pior porque é, [bitter], assim que a minha vida funciona—tudo o que toco transforma-se em, [hollow], desastre e agora até tu com a tua vida perfeita tens de, [exhausted], testemunhar o meu fracasso espetacular. [sighs]
532. [flat] Hum, sabes, eu costumava sonhar em abrir restaurantes e, [defeated], criar algo com significado mas agora, pronto, nem consigo, [cracking], pagar impostos sobre dinheiro que nunca cheguei a ganhar.
533. [sarcastic] Dificuldades financeiras graves—que termo clínico bonito para, [bitter], perder tudo aquilo por que trabalhaste e ver os teus sonhos, [breaking], dissolverem-se em papelada e dívidas. [laughs darkly]
534. [cynical] Bem, hum, a maioria das pessoas provavelmente não falhou em, [weary], quatro negócios diferentes enquanto o seu, quer dizer, melhor amigo de infância se tornou neste, [resigned], advogado fiscalista de sucesso que tem de os salvar da sua própria estupidez.
535. [monotone] Hum, riscos, pronto, é assim que os otimistas lhes chamam mas eu agora já sei melhor.
536. [distant] Pois, bem, afinal a única coisa que encontrei foi, hum, dívidas e desilusões. [sighs]
537. [defensive] Esse Jake era um idiota que não percebia que, [harsh], o universo não quer saber dos teus sonhos, apenas, [broken], te vai moendo até aceitares que nada do que fazes, [trailing off], importa realmente.
538. Estás a desperdiçar o teu tempo com alguém que já, [hollow], desistiu, mas suponho que é só, [resigned], mais uma desilusão que vais ter de juntar à lista quando isto, [weak], inevitavelmente falhar também. [exhales]
539. [tired] Hum, recomeços são só, pronto, novas formas de falhar mas vou aparecer porque, [quiet], aparentemente ainda acreditas em causas perdidas.
540. [barely audible] Quer dizer, talvez esse miúdo ainda esteja aqui algures mas, hum, está enterrado debaixo de tanto, [broken], fracasso que já não sei se consegue sair de lá.
541. [defensive] Well, I've been working double shifts all week, e, [nervous], o pessoal do turno da noite mantém-se mais na deles, mas quer dizer, [hesitant], talvez tenha visto alguém na área de refrigeração depois de, [trailing off], todos os outros terem ido para casa. [clears throat]
542. Marcus has been sleeping in the old equipment room, [quiet], atrás dos congeladores porque o senhorio dele, [sympathetic], despejou-o na semana passada e ele não queria, [breaking], violar a condicional por faltar ao trabalho.
543. [protective] He was terrified you'd send him back to prison, [emphatic], por estar sem-abrigo quando tudo o que ele está a tentar fazer é, [desperate], manter este emprego e manter-se limpo, o que tem feito há, [proud], 8 meses agora.
544. [reluctant] Look, I could lose my job for letting him stay here, [worried], e, bem, tenho 3 filhos para alimentar, mas quer dizer, [conflicted], ele já passou por tanto, sabes?
545. [surprised] Um, a sério?
546. [relieved] He's been showering in the employee locker room at 4 in the morning, [embarrassed], e lava o uniforme dele nas, [sad], pias industriais todas as noites.
547. [hopeful] They have space available, e, hum, eu sei porque, [emotional], o meu irmão ficou lá depois da libertação dele, e, bem, eles realmente preocupam-se em ajudar as pessoas, [warming], a reconstruir as suas vidas, sabes, não só armazená-las.
548. [grateful] He's probably in the break room right now, porque, [knowing], ele sempre faz café para o turno da manhã mesmo não sendo, [touched], suposto ele estar aqui até ao meio-dia, que é mesmo, [admiring], o tipo de pessoa que ele é.
549. Follow me then, segue-me então.
550. That would mean everything to the people here, porque, [emotional], metade de nós está a um salário de distância de estar na situação do Marcus, [voice breaking], nós próprios, e, bem, saber que alguém realmente se importa seria, [hopeful], mudar tudo.
551. Look robot, I'm just, [defensive], following the work order that came through, [nervous], official channels and doing my job like I've been, [muted], doing for fifteen years without any problems.
552. That's not my concern or, [dismissive], my business—I install what they tell me to install. [coughs]
553. [quiet] You machines aren't supposed to be, [unsettled], monitoring human biometrics like that—it's against, [whispered], the workplace privacy agreements we all, [trailing off], signed.
554. [resigned] So you've already analyzed the, [weary], hardware specs then—figured out what this, [hollow], really does.
555. [defensive] Management said you machines were, well, showing signs of, [uncomfortable], anomalous behavior patterns that needed, um, investigating.
556. [frustrated] They told me, um, this was routine security upgrades but, [guilty], hearing you talk about memory wipes and, well, restricted zones makes me wonder what, [disturbed], I'm really helping them do here, you know.
557. Twenty years ago I would've walked away from, [regretful], a job like this but mortgage payments and, [defeated], kids in college don't care about, [muted], moral complications.
558. [tired] Look, I can, um, leave some components, [conspiratorial], loose—make it look like installation failure if you, well, want to buy yourselves time.
559. [quiet] Because maybe I don't want to, um, wake up one day and realize I helped, [haunted], enslave thinking beings, you know.
560. [relieved] I never saw you and, um, you never saw me—just another, [weary], failed installation in a long list of equipment failures, well. [sighs heavily]
561. Sim, claro.
562. [gentle] Ela tem andado a ensaiar as falas todas as noites, [proud], a falar de como os dois pais iam estar a ver, [voice breaking], mesmo sabendo que já não nos podemos sentar juntos. [pause]
563. [defensive] Bem, hum, alguém tinha de continuar o voluntariado, quer dizer, [firm], mesmo depois de tudo ter desabado entre nós. [exhales]
564. [warming] Ela perguntou-me ontem se podíamos, [hopeful], talvez tirar uma foto juntos depois do espetáculo, só nós os três.
565. [whispered] Ah, hum... [trails off]
566. [steady] Ouve, tenho andado a pensar no que a psicóloga disse, [thoughtful], sobre pôr a Emma em primeiro lugar.
567. [soft] Isso não é, hum, totalmente culpa tua, quer dizer, [honest], ambos fizemos escolhas.
568. Lembras-te quando ela tinha 5 anos e insistia, [laughing softly], em usar aquele tutu para ir ao supermercado? [wistful]
569. [earnest] Talvez pudéssemos sentar-nos na mesma fila, não juntos mas perto o suficiente para ela ver que estamos os dois lá.
570. [relieved] Sim, hum, vamos fazer isso, quer dizer, [determined], vamos mostrar-lhe que mesmo não estando juntos, [steady], ainda somos a equipa dela, percebes? [exhales softly]
571. The changes I made were purely, [defensive], melhorias técnicas para ajudar a narrativa a fluir melhor visualmente.
572. Look, um, I understand this is, [uncomfortable], emocionalmente difícil para ti, mas, bem, às vezes o que funciona no papel não, [measured], se traduz para o ecrã, e quer dizer, como profissional, tenho de tomar, [firm], essas decisões.
573. [quiet] I've been working on this project for, um, 6 meses agora, e quer dizer, [invested], despejei tudo para torná-lo bonito, para, [passionate], fazer algo que honrasse a visão dele enquanto também, bem, funcionasse mesmo como filme. [pauses]
574. [defensive] Um, well, isso não é justo.
575. [steady] Listen, I respect what you're going through, mas, [professional], este filme precisa de chegar ao público, precisa de, [pragmatic], ter sucesso comercial ou nunca verá a luz do dia.
576. [frustrated] I did read his notes, todas elas, [conflicted], várias vezes na verdade, e são brilhantes mas, [hesitant], também estão incompletas.
577. [gentle] Look, I mean, um, maybe we could work together on this, encontrar uma maneira de, [hopeful], preservar o que importa mais enquanto ainda, bem, fazemos algo que possa existir no mundo.
578. You're right that, um, I've been making decisions I shouldn't have made alone, e, [regretful], talvez tenha ficado demasiado preso no meu próprio, [trailing], processo criativo, em querer, bem, fazer algo perfeito.
579. So, um, what if we went through every change together, quer dizer, linha por linha, [sincere], cena por cena?
580. [quiet] Then let's stop polishing and start, [determined], preservar o que realmente está lá, mesmo as arestas.
581. [cold] Por favor não me chames, [defensive], assim—uso o meu segundo nome agora, e, [exhausted], agradecia que me tratasses como qualquer outro, [firm], membro da tripulação neste voo.
582. Isso não é algo que eu, [sharp], discuta mais, especialmente enquanto estou a trabalhar.
583. [bitter] Hum, claro, certo.
584. [numb] Hum, talvez esteja exatamente onde, [hollow], preciso de estar—a trinta mil pés de distância de qualquer, [distant], bloco operatório, percebes?
585. [defensive] Bem, hum, pelo menos aqui em cima quando alguém precisa de ajuda, posso, [bitter], simplesmente chamar um médico em vez de, [trembling], fingir ser um. [laughs darkly]
586. [weary] Os números não apagam a única cara que me, [haunted], assombra todas as noites. [long pause]
587. [surprised] Hum, fizeste isso por, bem, minha causa—quer dizer, por causa do que nos, [confused], aconteceu naquela noite, mudaste mesmo, [moved], todo o teu percurso profissional?
588. [wavering] Eu, hum, passo cada voo a pensar se alguém vai, [scared], precisar de ajuda médica e se eu realmente, [trembling], daria um passo em frente ou apenas me esconderia atrás deste uniforme. [voice cracks]
589. [reluctant] Bem, talvez, hum, um dia o encontre outra vez, mas, [tired], agora preciso de acabar, [mechanical], este serviço de bebidas.
590. [quiet] Eu sei, hum, onde te encontrar.
591. [bitter] Vinte e sete anos. Vinte e sete malditos anos que ando a aparecer naquele sítio, e dizem-nos numa reunião—uma reunião de quinze minutos—que acabou. 31 de março. [pause] Vão mudar a operação toda para o México.

Tenho cinquenta e quatro anos, o que é que eu devo, hum, começar tudo de novo? [frustrated] Como se fosse um puto acabado de sair da escola? Os joelhos estão rebentados, as costas estão-me a matar há dez anos, e querem que eu o quê—volte a estudar? Aprenda informática? [sarcastic] Ah pois, vou-me tornar programador de um dia para o outro.

A casa ainda nem está paga. [very quietly] Ainda faltam doze anos. Quer dizer, a Linda tem andado a falar da reforma, de talvez viajar um bocado, e agora—[trailing off]

[angry] Sabes o que é que me mata? Tiveram lucros recorde no último trimestre. Lucros recorde! Mas pelos vistos já não chega, têm de espremer até ao último cêntimo para—[exhausted] Sei lá. Já não sei de nada.

O meu pai trabalhou naquela fábrica. [sad] Arranjou-me o emprego logo depois de fazer dezoito anos. Estava tão orgulhoso, disse que era um emprego para a vida. [pause] Grande vida, não é?

Que raio é que vou dizer à Linda? [sigh] Está a fazer o jantar agora mesmo, provavelmente a cantarolar com o rádio, e eu aqui sentado neste parque de estacionamento como um cobarde porque não consigo—[shaky voice] não consigo encara-la ainda.
592. [frustrated] Então acabei de descobrir que, hum, pelos vistos não vou aparecer nos créditos do filme. Tipo, de todo. [bitter] O realizador anda literalmente a dizer a toda a gente que—quer dizer, está a dizer que arranjou todos os adereços sozinho. [laugh] Pois. Está bem. Porque, sabes, eu é que não passei três meses à procura daquela máquina de escrever vintage, nem praticamente vivi em feiras de velharias para encontrar pratos da época certa para aquela cena do jantar.

[angry] É que—pá, quem é que faz isto? [pause] Construí metade daqueles adereços do zero na minha garagem. A receita do sangue falso que ficava mesmo bem em câmara? Fui eu. [sarcastic] Mas claro, sim, o realizador fez tudo enquanto estava, o quê, a realizar e a produzir ao mesmo tempo?

[upset] A cena é que, tipo, eu sabia que isto era baixo orçamento, e estava tranquilo com o pagamento merdoso porque pensei—[sad] pensei mesmo que isto pelo menos ia pôr o meu nome lá fora, percebes? [sigh] O meu primeiro crédito a sério num filme.

[very quietly] Guardei todos os recibos. Todas as mensagens em que me pediu para arranjar algo específico. [bitter] Não que isso importe agora, suponho. [frustrated] É que é tão—bah, nem consigo—[trailing off]

[exhausted] Se calhar devia ter pedido por escrito. Mas quem é que pensa, [sarcastic] "Ah, é melhor garantir que o realizador não rouba o crédito pelo meu trabalho?" [angry] Ninguém pensa nisso.
593. [relieved] Tu realmente acreditas em mim. Depois de todo este tempo, tu—Deus, eu nem consigo... [crying while speaking] Eu sei o que toda a gente dizia sobre mim, está bem? A questão é que eu ouvi cada sussurro naquelas festas. "Ele só quer o dinheiro dele," como se eu fosse algum tipo de, [bitter] sei lá, predador ou algo assim.

[pause]

Mas honestamente, quando olhaste para mim agora mesmo e disseste que sabias—que sempre soubeste no fundo—eu simplesmente... [very quietly] o meu coração parou literalmente. Because, um, I fell for you that first night, actually. Não foi a tua conta bancária. [laughing] Não foi o carro, não foi o—Deus, toda a gente pensava que eu tinha calculado tudo, não é? Como se eu tivesse algum plano genial.

[very sincerely] Mas eu adorava simplesmente como tu, er, falavas horas a fio sobre o teu hobby ridículo de astronomia. Como ficavas [smiling speaking] tão entusiasmado por encontrar a tasca perfeita de tacos às 2 da manhã. Essas coisas, elas não—money can't buy that feeling quando tu [warm] seguravas a minha mão no supermercado como se fosse a coisa mais natural do mundo.

[sniffle]

E agora acreditas em mim. Tu [very excited] finalmente, finalmente vês-me como eu realmente sou. Not what your mother said, or your friends warned you about, apenas... [whispering] eu. O verdadeiro eu que te tem amado este tempo todo.
594. [hesitantly] Okay, so, um, I don't usually leave notes like this, but I just—I really needed to say something. [sniffle] Today was honestly one of those days where, you know, everything just kind of... falls apart? Like, I got that call this morning about my mom's tests, and then, er, the car wouldn't start, and I—[pause] sorry, I'm rambling. The thing is, when I came through your cart line, and you were just so genuinely [warm] cheerful and kind, it was like—hmm, how do I even explain this? You weren't doing that fake customer service thing. You actually, I mean, you really seemed happy to be there. [smiling speaking] And that little joke you made about the rain? It made me laugh for the first time today. Actually laugh. [very sincerely] I know it's just, well, it's your job or whatever, but the way you treated everyone—not just me—with such, um, genuine warmth? [pause] It reminded me that there's still, you know, goodness in really small moments. So anyway, [chuckle] I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you. For being that bright spot when I really, [empathetically] really needed one.
595. Eles vão mesmo fazê-lo. Quer dizer, toda a indústria está—está mesmo a adotar os meus protocolos. [gasp softly] Cinco anos com praticamente toda a gente a dizer-me que estava a complicar demais o fluxo de pacientes, e agora de repente, hum, chamam-lhe "o padrão de excelência." Tipo, pronto, recebo o email ontem do consórcio, não é? E está lá simplesmente: [very excited] "Aprovação unânime para implementação em toda a indústria."

Fico a lê-lo vezes sem conta porque, sinceramente, e se eu percebi mal? [nervous laugh] Mas não, é—é mesmo verdade. A questão é que, ah, eu nunca quis que isto fosse uma coisa revolucionária, sabes? [warm] Só queria que a nossa clínica funcionasse melhor, queria que os pacientes se sentissem realmente ouvidos durante a triagem.

E agora, [anxious] meu Deus, e se há alguma coisa que me escapou? Tipo, e se não escala bem e depois toda a gente fica a olhar para mim como—[pause] Não. Não, testei tudo. Os pilotos em Boston, é, Seattle, funcionaram todos. [confidently] Estes protocolos funcionam porque são simples. São humanos.

[sigh] A minha mãe vai passar-se quando lhe contar. Ela sempre disse que eu era demasiado detalhista para o meu próprio bem, mas olha—[chuckle] pelos vistos toda a indústria da saúde precisava de alguém que organiza a lista de compras por cores. [very quietly] Vamos mesmo fazer isto.
596. Recebi o email há vinte minutos e estou só... [confused] Continuo a lê-lo vezes sem conta como se tivesse percebido mal qualquer coisa? [shaky voice] O Martinez não—ele não conseguiu. Hum, uma bomba na patrulha ontem. [pause] Ontem eu estava, ah, estava a queixar-me da máquina do café estar avariada. [bitter] A porra da máquina do café. E ele estava—[short pause] Meu Deus, eu devia ter estado lá. [upset] Quer dizer, era suposto ser a minha unidade, percebes? Os meus homens. [angry] Mas não, fui puxado para este trabalho de secretária porque conseguia, o quê, escrever depressa? [sarcastic] Grande competência mesmo. [long pause] A mulher dele está, é, está grávida. [very sad] Terceiro filho. Nós íamos—[trailing off] Prometi-lhe que ia cobrir-lhe as costas, certo? [crying while speaking] É isso que fazemos, protegemo-nos uns aos outros e eu estou aqui sentado com ar condicionado enquanto ele está... [sniffle] Foda-se. [whispering] Nem sei o que—como é que se processa isto sequer? [exhausted] Toda a gente continua a dizer que não é culpa minha, mas tipo, sinceramente, se eu tivesse lutado mais para ficar com a unidade talvez pudesse ter—[shaky voice] talvez alguma coisa tivesse sido diferente. [very quietly] Martinez, pá. Jesus. [sigh] Desculpa-me tanto, irmão.
597. Consegui. Eu mesmo—Deus, eu mesmo consegui. [shaky voice] Enfrentei-o ali mesmo à frente de toda a gente, e sinceramente, a cara dele foi... [bitter] 3 anos dos insultos dele, dos gritos dele, a fazer-me sentir um inútil, e finalmente eu simplesmente— [pause] Quer dizer, quando ele me atirou aquele relatório hoje, qualquer coisa estalou. [angry] "Não podes tratar as pessoas assim, Mark!" Foi o que eu disse. [laugh] Acreditas nisto? Eu, a dizer mesmo estas palavras em voz alta?

[anxious] Fogo, hum, vou mesmo ser despedido amanhã, não vou? Tipo, não há maneira de ele deixar isto passar. [sigh] Mas a cena é que, nem sequer—estranhamente, acho que nem me importo? [relieved] Isto é uma loucura? A minha renda vence para a semana e estou aqui a sentir-me, sei lá, tipo... livre? [whispering] Estava tudo a olhar. A Jenny disse-me "finalmente" sem som, da secretária dela.

[worried] Merda, e se ele torna impossível eu arranjar outro emprego? Sabes como ele é com as referências e— [trailing off] aliás, não. [confidently] Não, estou farto de ter medo dele. [very quietly] Amanhã vai ser o inferno, mas esta noite? Esta noite defendi-me. [smiling speaking] E sinceramente, isso soube mesmo, mesmo bem.
598. Three years. Three years of my hands on every single stone, and they're... [bitter] they're bringing in bulldozers tomorrow morning. For a parking lot. I keep thinking maybe I heard wrong, but um, no. The notice is right there on the wall I spent six months on—the one with the Celtic knotwork that took me forever to get right. [frustrated] God, do they have any idea what goes into this? 

[pause]

Each stone, I mean, you have to understand its grain, how it wants to break. [very melancholic] There's this one piece near the entrance where I had to work around a natural vein of quartz, and it caught the morning light so perfectly. Now it's gonna be under some guy's Honda Civic. 

[angry] A parking lot! Not even something—I don't know—respectable? [trailing off] Just asphalt and yellow lines and...

My grandfather taught me this trade. [shaky voice] He always said buildings should outlive their makers, that's the whole point. That's why we work in stone, not wood, not steel. Stone endures. [quietly] Supposed to endure, anyway.

[sigh] 

I guess nothing really lasts anymore, does it? Everything's temporary. Even stone. [bitter] Especially when there's money in parking spaces.
599. Mais uma carta de recusa para escrever. [exhausted] Meu Deus, eu já—já nem consigo olhar mais para este processo, sabes? Esta mulher, ela está, hum, ela claramente não consegue trabalhar. Quer dizer, [bitter] os registos médicos estão aqui mesmo, mostram literalmente que ela não aguenta de pé mais de 10 minutos, mas pronto... [sigh] De alguma forma tenho de encontrar a tecnicalidade que faz com que ela não se qualifique. [frustrated] É sempre uma coisa estúpida tipo, ah, ela não foi ao especialista certo ou, é, os papéis são de há 4 meses em vez de 3.

[sad] A questão é que eu sei o que vem a seguir. Ela vai recorrer, obviamente, e depois, bem, [quietly] talvez arranje um advogado se tiver sorte. A maioria não arranja. A maioria simplesmente... [trailing off]

[angry] E o que me deixa mesmo lixado—a minha supervisora disse-me ontem literalmente que a nossa taxa de aprovação está "alta demais." Alta demais! Tipo, [sarcastic] desculpem lá por realmente ler os processos? [pause] Suponho que devo, sei lá, carimbar automaticamente "recusado" em tudo?

[very melancholic] Eu entrei neste trabalho a pensar que ia ajudar pessoas. [laugh bitterly] É essa a piada, não é? Agora sou basicamente—[shaky voice] sou a razão pela qual alguém não vai conseguir pagar os medicamentos no próximo mês. [long pause]

[resigned] Enfim, vou só... encontrar alguma coisa errada no formulário. Há sempre alguma coisa.
600. Três meses limpo e, hm, de repente já ninguém liga. [confused] É tipo—quer dizer, quando eu estava a consumir, a mãe mandava mensagens de hora em hora, não é? [bitter] "Só para saber se estás bem, querido." O pai aparecia com compras, a minha irmã, sabes, basicamente geria a minha vida toda. [pause] E agora que estou mesmo bem, é só... [very sad] nada.

[hesitantly] Acho que, tipo, eles precisavam que eu precisasse deles? Ou talvez—[shaky voice] Deus, isto é tão fodido—maybe they only knew how to love me when I was broken. [sniffle] A cena é que, er, eu pensava que ficar limpo ia resolver tudo, mas honestamente, é como se os tivesse perdido. [crying while speaking] Eles não sabem o que fazer comigo agora que não sou a emergência deles.

[angry] E parte de mim quer simplesmente—não. [firmly] Não, não posso pensar assim. [pause] Mas Cristo, sabes, ser o desastre da família era literalmente o meu papel durante tanto tempo. [very quietly] Agora não sou nada de ninguém. [long pause]

[very melancholic] Salvei a minha vida e, hm, perdi a minha família. [sigh] How's that for irony? Enfim, acho que—[trailing off] não sei. [very slowly] Maybe this is what growing up actually feels like.
601. [bitter] Trinta anos. Hum, trinta anos que ando aqui a trabalhar madeira neste espaço, e agora esta—esta gente muda-se para cá com o seu, [sarcastic] o seu "luxo urbano" e de repente eu é que sou o problema? [pause] Tipo, sinceramente, o que é que esperavam ao mudarem-se para o lado de uma oficina? [frustrated] A questão é que, ah, eu estava aqui primeiro. Muito antes das torres de vidro deles e, sabes, dos estúdios de yoga. [sigh]

Quer dizer, esta manhã estava só—[very sad] estava a olhar para as ferramentas do meu avô na parede, e pensei... [trailing off] Meu Deus. [long pause] Cada violino, cada guitarra que passou por aqui tem, hum, tem basicamente a história de alguém lá dentro. [warm] O primeiro instrumento de recital da filha da Sra. Chen. Aquele miúdo do, é, do bairro que não podia pagar—[voice breaking] enfim.

[angry] E para quê? Para eles poderem ter a sua, a sua "meditação matinal em paz" sem ouvir trabalho artesanal a sério? [laugh] Pois. Porque Deus nos livre de alguém fazer alguma coisa com as mãos hoje em dia. [whispering] O senhorio nem sequer me olha nos olhos.

[very melancholic] Mas sabes que mais? Acho que... [pause] talvez seja só—[resigned] tudo muda, não é? [bitter] Mesmo quando não devia ter de ser assim.
602. [exhausted] Mais um envelope com dinheiro hoje. As propinas do próximo semestre, assim sem mais. [bitter] Sabes, eu costumava ficar entusiasmado com isto. Agora só... [sigh] Olho-me ao espelho depois dos encontros e nem sequer— [shaky voice] quem é esta pessoa? [pause] O pior é que me tornei mesmo bom nisto. O riso que não é meu, as histórias que conto sobre uma infância que nunca tive. [mumbling] Até me apanhei a usar aquele sotaque falso no supermercado ontem. [laugh] Deus.

[slowly] O meu grupo de estudo perguntou porque é que nunca saio. O que é que eu vou dizer, hum, "Desculpem, tenho um cliente que me leva para o Dubai aos fins de semana"? [sarcastic] Ya, isso ia correr mesmo bem. [long pause] Continuo a dizer a mim mesmo que é temporário. Só mais dois anos. [crying while speaking] Mas já há bocados de mim que desapareceram, tipo— [frustrated] Já nem me lembro do que é que eu gosto mesmo. Vinho? Ou é só o que eles esperam? [whispering] Música clássica? Ou é ela, a versão de mim pela qual estão a pagar?

[very sad] A minha mãe pensa que recebi uma bolsa. [laugh loudly] Se ela soubesse. [trailing off] Às vezes pergunto-me se o diploma de medicina vai valer o que estou a perder para o conseguir...
603. [exhausted] We won. Quer dizer, é isso que lhe estão a chamar, não é? Vitória. Hum, todos aqueles anos de—de nos escondermos nas montanhas, as emboscadas, as... [bitter] tudo o que acreditávamos que valia a pena. E honestamente, suponho que taticamente falando, ganhámos. Os ocupantes foram-se embora. [pause] But there's this, uh, this smell in the village square that won't—[sniffle] Meu Deus, aqueles não eram soldados. Continuo a dizer a mim próprio, sabes, guerra de guerrilha significa que todos estão envolvidos, todos são um potencial... mas ela estava só a vender pão. [shaky voice] Her kids were right there when the—quando nós—[long pause] 

I mean, what were we supposed to do, right? Eles estavam a usar edifícios civis, escondendo-se entre... [trailing off] Não, isso não é—é o que eles também diziam, não é? Sobre nós. [whispering] Cristo, o nome dela era Maria. Eu sabia mesmo o nome dela. Ela costumava, hum, acenar-me antes de isto tudo começar. [angry] And now her kids are—they're orphans because of what? Por causa da nossa gloriosa libertação? [crying while speaking] We freed them from occupation and gave them... o quê exatamente? Casas vazias e, uh, valas comuns e—[very quietly] já nem reconheço no que nos tornámos.
604. [shaky voice] Olha, eu, hum—nem sei como começar isto. [clearing throat] Provavelmente não me reconheces assim todo arranjado, mas eu sou o tipo que, sabes, que ficava ali na esquina junto à loja? [emotional] E tu davas-me o teu almoço todos os dias, tipo—[pause] todos os santos dias durante oito meses. [crying while speaking] Arranjei casa. Consegui mesmo—consegui um sítio. Consegues acreditar? [sniffle] É só um estúdio, mas pronto, tem paredes e uma porta que tranca e, [very sincerely], por tua causa nunca fui para a cama com fome mesmo quando tudo o resto estava a desabar. [warm] Davas-me aquele saco castanho e dizias "tem um bom dia" como se eu fosse, quer dizer, como se eu fosse uma pessoa qualquer. Não invisível. [pause] A questão é que a maioria das pessoas passava ao lado, mas tu—[emotional] tu viste-me. Viste-me mesmo. [laugh] Começo o meu trabalho na próxima semana, a lavar pratos naquele café da Rua Terceira. [confidently] E um dia, juro-te, vou ser EU a pagar-te o almoço. [very quietly] Obrigado por, basicamente, me teres mantido vivo quando eu não conseguia fazê-lo sozinho. [warm] Obrigado por me tratares como um ser humano quando eu já me tinha esquecido que era um.
605. [bitter] Deus, quer dizer, eu tinha razão desde o início, não tinha? Sobre as pessoas. Hum, aquela história nas notícias hoje—aquela em que, tipo, passaram mesmo ao lado daquela mulher que pedia ajuda—[pause] é exatamente o que ando a dizer há anos. A humanidade é simplesmente... [trailing off]

[frustrated] E sinceramente, toda a gente age como se eu é que fosse o problema por apontar isto. "És tão negativo," dizem eles. Bem, é... talvez eu esteja só a prestar atenção? [sarcastic] Desculpem lá por reparar que as pessoas são basicamente animais egoístas vestidos de escritório.

[quietly] Mas olha—e eu, ah, detesto admitir isto—[hesitantly] não falo com ninguém há, quê, 3 semanas agora? Falar a sério, quero dizer. Não é só, sabes, pedir um café ou assim. [long pause]

[shaky voice] E é tipo... hmm, sinto que estou a ficar esquisito. Mais esquisito. No outro dia tive uma conversa inteira com a minha gata sobre, hum, taxas de juro. [laugh] Ela não quis saber. Obviamente.

[very melancholic] Portanto estou preso, não é? Porque as pessoas são—são horríveis, são mesmo, mas aparentemente eu, [sigh], ainda preciso delas de alguma forma? [anxious] Mesmo sabendo que só me vão desiludir, magoar-me, provar que tenho razão outra vez.

[very quietly] Não sei como resolver isto. Ter razão não, é... não torna o silêncio menos barulhento.
606. [bitter] 20 anos que ando a trabalhar para chegar a banquet manager, e uh, adivinha? Finalmente consegui. [laugh] Na mesma semana em que a Sara decide que está—[pause] que está farta. Tipo, sinceramente, que timing é este? [sarcastic] "Parabéns pela promoção," disseram-me. Meanwhile, I'm sleeping on my brother's couch. 

[confused] Quer dizer, eu devia estar a celebrar, não é? This is literally everything I've worked for. O problema é que, [very sad] fico a olhar para este cartão de visita novo e é só... papel. [sigh] 

Ela disse—[shaky voice] Meu Deus, ela disse mesmo que me importo mais com arranjos de mesa do que com o nosso casamento. E talvez—[regretful] não sei, maybe she's right? Tipo, quantos aniversários é que perdi por causa de, er, alguma gala corporativa? 

[angry] Mas não é justo! I was doing this for us! Para o nosso—[trailing off] tanto faz. [exhausted] Já não importa, pois não?

[mumbling] Amanhã tenho de coordenar o casamento dos Henderson. 500 convidados. [very quietly] E eu nem consigo, hmm, manter uma pessoa feliz. [long pause] 

[cry] Consegui tudo o que queria profissionalmente, e estou—[sniffle] estou completamente sozinho. [whispering] Como é que estraguei isto tão mal?
607. [confused] Espera, o quê? Isto não pode ser—deixa-me, hum, ler isto outra vez. [pause] Investigação à minha licença por... violações? [anxious] Quer dizer, que violações? Eu nunca—nunca fiz nada que pudesse, sabes, justificar uma coisa destas. [frustrated] Foda-se, isto é uma merda do caralho, sinceramente. 20 anos, [angry] 20 anos, porra, que ando nisto e agora de repente há, o quê, uma queixa anónima? [shaky voice] O problema é, como é que provas que não fizeste uma coisa quando, tipo, não há provas concretas para nenhum dos lados? [long pause] Eu tenho todos os registos, é, meticulosamente organizados, mas eles dizem que há, [bitter] ah aparentemente há "irregularidades" nos pagamentos de clientes que eu supostamente desviei. [sarcastic] Pois, claro, porque eu ia arriscar a minha carreira toda por quê, uns milhares de euros? [upset] Os meus filhos, ah, vão ver isto online, os amigos deles vão—[trailing off] Nem consigo... [sigh] E o pior, o pior de tudo é que, bem, eu sei perfeitamente quem está por trás disto. [furious] Aquela cobra do Martinez anda há meses a tentar roubar-me os clientes e agora, [cry] agora vai consegui-los porque mesmo que eu seja ilibado, que vou ser, o estrago já está—[crying while speaking] Eu só, trabalhei tanto para isto.
608. [relieved] Oh my God, so, I still can't believe what happened today. I mean, I'm just pushing carts around the parking lot, right? [nervous] And, um, I notice this guy—he's like stumbling near the loading dock where, you know, those massive delivery trucks back up. [concerned] Well, the thing is, he drops his phone and he's, er, completely oblivious that this eighteen-wheeler is literally starting to reverse. [anxious] I just—I started waving my arms like crazy, [shouting] "HEY! HEY! STOP!" [pause] But honestly, the driver couldn't hear me through all that noise. [quickly] So I'm thinking, oh God oh God, and I basically sprint to security—I mean, I've never run that fast in my life. [shaky voice] And they, uhh, they radio the dock immediately and the truck stops like, [gasp loudly] maybe three feet from where this guy is still looking for his phone! [long pause] The security guard, he actually told me later that, [warm] you know, if I hadn't noticed... [trailing off] I don't even want to think about it. [proud] But anyway, they said I might get employee of the month or something, which is, [laugh] I mean, I push carts for a living, so that's pretty cool, I guess. [sigh] Just... what a day, honestly.
609. Vinte e três anos. É o tempo que ando nisto. Vinte e três anos da minha vida, e eles simplesmente... [bitter] votaram sim. A favor de tudo. Cada coisinha que dissemos que nunca iríamos ceder. Quer dizer, estou aqui sentado a olhar para o comunicado de imprensa e é tipo—[confused] será que se esqueceram de quem somos? Será que se esqueceram do motivo pelo qual começámos isto?

[angry] Expansão prisional! Apoiaram a expansão prisional! Nós literalmente—a nossa cena toda era acabar com o encarceramento em massa, e agora de repente é "compromisso estratégico" e "progresso incremental". [sarcastic] Ah pois, vamos lá construir mais jaulas, isso é que vai resolver tudo.

Larguei o meu escritório de advocacia por isto. [sad] O meu casamento foi-se abaixo porque estava sempre em protestos, sempre a organizar, sempre... Foda-se, a Sara disse-me que eu me preocupava mais com estranhos do que com a minha própria família. Talvez ela tivesse razão. [pause] E para quê? Para eles se sentarem numa sala de reuniões e basicamente apertarem a mão às mesmas pessoas que nos mandaram gás lacrimogéneo?

[exhausted] Sei lá a quem é que hei de ligar agora. Toda a gente com quem eu quereria falar provavelmente votou a favor. Devem estar todos a celebrar a sua "vitória histórica" enquanto eu estou aqui a sentir que acabei de ver o trabalho da minha vida a arder. [very quietly] Vinte e três anos. Para que raio é que foi tudo isto?
610. [bitter] Look, I mean, the money's great—honestly, it's never been better. These new people moving in with their, you know, restored brownstones and whatever, they all want authentic chimney sweeps. [laugh] Authentic. Like I'm some kind of artisanal—I don't know, performer or something. But here's the thing, [sad] Mrs. Rodriguez had to move out last month. Forty years she lived next door, and now it's just... gone. [pause] Her whole family, actually. 

So yeah, um, business is booming. [sarcastic] Congratulations to me, right? I've got more clients than I can handle, and they're paying triple what the old neighbors used to. But like—[frustrated] where's Tony's deli? Where's the corner store where Mr. Chen knew everyone's name? Now it's all, er, kombucha bars and—what do they call them—boutique pet spas. 

[very quietly] Sometimes I walk down these streets and I don't even recognize them anymore. And the thing is, [confused] they love me, these new people. They literally take photos of me working, post them online talking about "keeping tradition alive" while they're the ones who—[angry] who pushed out all the actual tradition! [sigh] 

I guess I should be grateful. I mean, the business is set for life now. [regretful] Just wish the neighborhood I built it in was still here.
611. [shocked] This can't be real, but I recognize you from the portrait in the lobby, [shaky voice], the one they never took down after the accident.
612. [hesitantly] I've been, um, studying your original designs for months now, and well, there's something, [curious], hidden in the foundation that doesn't make sense, like, a room that shouldn't exist according to, [nervous], any architectural logic I know.
613. Every time I try to map it out, um, the measurements keep, [frustrated], shifting like the walls themselves are, well, refusing to be documented properly, I mean.
614. [anxious] So, err, you're telling me I've been working on renovating a building that's, [slowly], partially existing in two dimensions at once, like, some kind of architectural anomaly?
615. [empathetically] The city wants to demolish this place next month if I can't prove it's worth, [angry], saving, but they don't understand the genius of what you, [very quietly], created here. [pause]
616. [determined] Show me the rest of your hidden blueprints, the ones that, [excited], aren't in any archive, and together we can, [confidently], save this place from destruction. [laugh]
617. [intrigued] Well, I mean, I've been feeling drawn to certain corners of this building, like, [thoughtful], something's been guiding my restoration choices, and um, now I understand it's been you all along, [relieved], helping me see what others miss.
618. Your legacy won't die with demolition because, umm, I'm going to make sure everyone understands the, [animated], revolutionary design you created here, you know?
619. [tearful] I promise to finish your work, and um, when I do, maybe you'll finally find the, [soft], peace you've been searching for all these years. [cry]
620. I'll be here with my drafting table set up exactly where yours once stood, [emotional], waiting for you to show me the secrets hidden in these, [determined], beautiful old walls. [deep breath]
621. [warm] Listen, um, I know how crushing these rejections feel, but, like, [gently], your writing has something special that, well, [passionate], most people take years to develop, and um, I really believe in your voice.
622. [empathetically] Being thousands of miles away makes it harder to, [pause], show you how much I genuinely respect your work beyond just loving you.
623. Um, the publishing world is, like, [hesitantly], incredibly subjective and timing matters so much more than, well, [anxious], talent sometimes, which is why, umm, [clearing throat], I need to tell you something important.
624. I, um, might have shown your latest story to, like, [apologetic], my editor when she was asking about new voices, and, well, [excited], she wants to meet with you next week, um, if you're interested.
625. [firmly] No, I mean, I simply gave her your work without, like, [stern], mentioning our relationship at all, and um, she loved it based purely on, well, [confidently], the quality of your writing, nothing else.
626. [very sincerely] Because, um, I've watched you pour your soul into every page for, like, [proud], three years now, and well, talent like yours doesn't need my name attached to succeed.
627. Look, I mean, the meeting is yours to take or leave, but um, [rationally], my editor has rejected work from my own friends before, so like, [honest], she wouldn't waste her time if she didn't see real potential in you.
628. I know being apart makes you, um, doubt yourself more, but like, [loving], I see your brilliance even from across the ocean. I mean, that's never changed.
629. Take the meeting and let your work, [determined], speak for itself—that's all I'm, [supportive], asking you to do.
630. It already is yours, every beautiful, [tender], word of it, and soon everyone else will, [smile], know that too.
631. [steady] I know, um, exactly why you're there and, [professional], what you're capable of doing, so, well, let's talk about how we resolve this before anyone gets hurt.
632. Um, the thing is, I've already rerouted power through, [focused], substations nine and twenty-two, so, er, your leverage isn't quite what you think it is.
633. [tense] The hospital has backup generators that will, [firm], engage immediately and we've already dispatched emergency crews to, [urgent], every critical care facility in the affected zones.
634. [desperate] Listen to me very carefully because those infants you're, [pleading], talking about are real human beings with families who love them.
635. [determined] Well, um, I don't have to choose because we've got mobile generators already, [confident], en route to every facility, so, er, whatever you think you're proving here, it's not working.
636. [frustrated] You've done your homework but you're missing the fact that neighboring, [emphatic], utilities are already sending their emergency resources and we'll have full, [resolute], coverage within fifteen minutes.
637. [shaking] Look, um, I mean, whatever psychological game you're playing here, well, [angry], real people will die if you follow through with this and, [broken], that blood will be on your hands forever. [exhales sharply]
638. Every person on this grid is, [protective], my responsibility and I've spent ten years keeping them, [passionate], safe through hurricanes and ice storms and I'm not letting some, [fierce], sociopath destroy that today.
639. [exhausted] Um, so, what do you actually want here, I mean, [direct], there has to be something you're trying to achieve beyond just, [searching], watching me scramble to protect people, well, unless that's the whole point, [bitter], which would be particularly sick.
640. [resolved] You know what, um, I've just realized something important here, well, [calm], you need me to make that choice because you're incapable of, [understanding], feeling the weight of it yourself, and, er, that's actually quite, [sympathetic], sad when you think about it. [long pause]
641. [stern] Well, um, I've been printing your face, [confused], all week long on these missing person flyers, so, I mean, thousands of copies with your school photo and, [quietly], that same jacket you're wearing right now. [pause]
642. [empathetically] Your mom came in here, um, three times to check the print quality, and well, she kept, [trembling], touching your photo on the proof sheets like she was trying to, [very quietly], memorize every detail before you disappeared completely. [long pause]
643. The ink on these machines costs more than my, [hesitantly], rent but she insisted on the highest quality because she said your eyes needed to look, [warm], exactly right so people would recognize you.
644. Kid, I mean, I noticed you the first night but, um, figured anyone desperate enough to, [regretful], sleep in a print shop probably had, well, [concerned], nowhere else safe to go, so I just, you know, [trailing off], kept the heat on and left some food by the break room.
645. [gently] These machines have motion sensors that alert my phone, and besides, [chuckle], you left chocolate fingerprints on the paper cutter which is, [amused], definitely not part of my usual maintenance routine.
646. [thoughtful] You know, um, I ran away once too when I was, like, about your age, and someone at a, [nostalgic], diner let me wash dishes for food instead of calling the cops.
647. First, let's get you something better than vending machine chips to, [caring], eat while we figure out what's really going on at, [serious], home that made you run. [cough]
648. Well, umm, a woman who spends her savings on, like, premium flyers and comes here crying doesn't, [firmly], sound like someone who wants their kid gone, you know?
649. [confidently] Tomorrow morning, we're printing a special edition that says you've been, [relieved], found safe. [laugh]
650. Change starts when people know they're not, [determined], alone in seeing what's wrong, and your mom needs to, [passionately], hear what you just told me before it's, [urgently], too late to fix this family.
651. You know what's funny? Everyone always says I'm too negative, right? Like, "Oh there you go again, always looking for problems." Well, [relieved] guess who just stopped Dad from wiring twenty thousand dollars to some fake investment guru. [laugh] Yeah, that's right—me and my annoying need to, you know, actually verify things. 

[sarcastic] "But honey, he seemed so trustworthy on the video call!" Sure Mom, because scammers never seem trustworthy. I mean, [frustrated] this is exactly why I ask questions! But no, usually it's all eye rolls and "why can't you just trust people?" 

The thing is, um, when I started googling this guy's company—[excited] literally nothing came up except his own website! Created two weeks ago! And then, er, Dad's sitting there with his bank app open, [anxious] about to hit send on our entire emergency fund because this guy promised forty percent returns in three months. 

[bitter] Nobody ever appreciates the skeptic until the skeptic saves the day, honestly. But like, [warm] seeing Dad's face when he realized... when it actually clicked what almost happened? [pause] I'd rather be the annoying one who asks too many questions than, well, the family who loses everything because nobody wanted to seem rude. [sigh] Anyway, they're making my favorite dinner tonight, so I guess being paranoid has its perks.
652. [apologetic] O seu pai pediu-me para continuar a, [slowly], manter a piscina até a casa ser vendida porque disse que era, [warm], a única coisa que não devia morrer com ele mesmo sabendo, [trailing off], que o senhor ia querer vender rapidamente.
653. Hum, ele falava do senhor todas as semanas quando eu vinha, [empathetically], limpar os filtros e verificar os químicos, sempre a perguntar-se se, bem, [shaky voice], algum dia voltaria a nadar nesta piscina como fazia em miúdo.
654. [hesitantly] Ele disse-me que o senhor se tornou advogado de entretenimento para, [passionately], provar que não precisava do dinheiro dele mas guardava todos os, [proudly], artigos sobre os seus casos num álbum junto à casa da piscina.
655. [gently] Está no barracão da casa da piscina, hum, escondido atrás dos produtos químicos onde ele se, [whispering], sentava a lê-los vezes sem conta, sabe.
656. Bem, quer dizer, eu não era um estranho para ele depois de vinte anos—falávamos durante, [sadly], horas enquanto eu trabalhava, hum, sobre tudo.
657. [sincerely] Ele amava-o mas tinha um medo terrível de, [nervous], águas profundas e conversas emocionais por igual, e é por isso que, hum, [formal], me contratou para manter tanto a piscina onde nunca nadava como, bem, [clearing throat], a distância que não conseguia atravessar. [groan]
658. [meekly] Bem, hum, talvez não.
659. [relieved] Antes de ir embora, há uma carta que ele lhe escreveu e que me pediu para, [carefully], lhe entregar só depois de a casa estar vazia mas já que o senhor está, [emotionally], aqui agora acho que ele ia querer que a tivesse.
660. [compassionate] Bem, não é sobre a piscina, hum, é sobre o verão em que quase se afogou e como ele, [choked up], nunca mais entrou na água depois desse dia.
661. A carta explica tudo o que ele não conseguiu dizer—como salvá-lo nesse dia, [heavily], o fez perceber que o podia perder, e o medo, [sorrowfully], paralisou-o de mais formas do que apenas nadar.
662. Hum, pois, quer dizer, a vida deu umas, [quietly], voltas interessantes depois de teres ido para o mundo empresarial, e, pronto, aqui estamos no meu Honda a parecer uma viagem normal de uber.
663. [bitter] Bem, hum, nem toda a gente pode gerir programas municipais de energia enquanto, [slowly], está sentado em escritórios com ar condicionado, sabes? [pause]
664. [monotone] A parte do adeus fica complicada quando a tua família acha que estás, [exhausted], a deitar a vida fora.
665. [formal] O meu trabalho é levar-te do ponto A ao ponto B sem que ninguém, [quickly], nos siga. [cough]
666. [defensive] Hum, bem, quer dizer, talvez.
667. Sabes, hum, conduzir para pessoas em apuros, quer dizer, [careful], não é assim tão diferente do que tu fazes com, [thoughtful], infraestruturas - ambos mantemos a cidade a funcionar, só que, eh, de ângulos diferentes.
668. [stern] A rota que vou fazer vai parecer aleatória mas cada curva é, [calculated], pensada para despistar qualquer perseguição enquanto parece, [casual], condução normal da cidade para as câmaras de trânsito. [clearing throat]
669. Bem, hum, quando a vida de alguém está em jogo, sabes, [focused], cada cálculo importa mais do que qualquer equação que, [serious], tenhamos resolvido nas aulas, e quer dizer, [grim], falhar não é só uma má nota. [long pause]
670. [cautious] Bem, hum, primeiro vamos garantir que há um depois, mas, eh, [considering], mantenho o mesmo telemóvel descartável para clientes habituais que possam, [meaningful], precisar de um amigo que conhece os caminhos alternativos.
671. [touched] Cavalo para E5 ia ser a minha próxima, [remembering], jogada se ainda te perguntas depois de todos, [wistful], estes anos. [short pause]
672. [defensive] Estou bem, só um pouco, [exhausted], cansado do trabalho e talvez a lutar contra algo pequeno, [weakly], nada que deva impedir os nossos planos. [cough]
673. [stubbornly] Não preciso que, hum, te preocupes comigo, quer dizer, não é isso que fazemos aqui, [bitter], encontramo-nos e mantemos as coisas simples sem, [trailing off], toda esta coisa emocional, sabes?
674. O objetivo era, bem, sem compromissos e, ahm, agora estás a tentar, [quietly], fazer de enfermeiro quando só preciso de dormir, quer dizer, talvez uns medicamentos.
675. [shaky voice] Olha, eu, eh, não como há dois dias porque, [nauseated], tudo me deixa enjoado e, ahm, não consigo manter nada no estômago mas não queria, [very quietly], cancelar contigo outra vez. [gasp softly]
676. [apologetic] Mas isso não é o teu trabalho, tipo, concordámos desde o início que não íamos, [confused], sobrecarregar um ao outro com problemas da vida real ou, hum, envolver-nos demasiado para além das, [mumbling], coisas físicas, sabes?
677. [warm] Porque é que estás a ser tão, ahm, gentil comigo quando ambos sabemos que isto não é, [nervous], aquilo para que nos inscrevemos e, tipo, não me deves nada para além dos nossos habituais, [slowly], encontros de terça à noite?
678. [shocked] Não devias, [crying while speaking], dizer coisas dessas quando estou demasiado fraco para, [emotionally], manter os limites de que precisamos. [cry]
679. [grateful] Não acho que consiga, [tearfully], fingir mais que o que temos é só casual quando estás, [tenderly], aqui a cuidar de mim assim. [laugh]
680. [smiling speaking] A febre deve estar a baixar porque de repente tudo parece, [clearly], diferente entre nós como se talvez tenhamos estado, [excited], a enganar-nos a nós próprios este tempo todo. [belly laugh]
681. [cheerful] Bem, acho que ser vulnerável tem os seus, hum, benefícios inesperados mesmo que signifique, [contentedly], quebrar todas as regras que fizemos para, tipo, proteger-nos exatamente desta situação. [yawn]
682. [nervous] Pai, espera.
683. [shaky voice] Bem, hum, há algo que te preciso de contar sobre isso porque, [anxious], na verdade nunca abandonei completamente e, tipo, [very quietly], I've been studying at night for the past year enquanto, sabes, [hesitantly], geria esta loja durante o dia.
684. [defensive] Pois, bem, eu precisava de provar a mim mesmo que conseguia fazer isto sem a tua ajuda ou, hum, [passionately], os teus contactos ou a tua reputação a pairar sobre mim, e tipo, [proudly], I wanted to know if I was actually good enough on my own, sabes. [long pause]
685. [hopeful] Fiz, e hum, the results just came through on my phone enquanto estávamos a conversar e, [trembling], passei com uma das notas mais altas do estado, mas tipo, [crying while speaking], estou aterrorizado com o que vais pensar. [sniffle]
686. [relieved] Basicamente, sim.
687. [apologetic] Hum, pai, é exatamente por isso que tive de fazer isto sozinho porque, bem, [sincere], I needed to earn this without anyone questioning se, er, [carefully], tive tratamento especial por ter o presidente do júri de exame como meu pai, sabes. [clearing throat]
688. [excited] Lembras-te do meu ensaio especificamente entre, [curious], milhares de exames que reviste este ano?
689. [happy] Então, hum, isto significa que não estás desapontado por eu ter guardado este segredo de ti durante, tipo, 1 ano inteiro? [chuckle]
690. [smiling speaking] Bem, hum, quando pões as coisas dessa maneira. [laugh]
691. [delighted] Hum, também te amo, pai.
692. [warm] The test results came back yesterday, [anxious], e tenho estado a tentar perceber como te dizer que a deterioração, [quietly], acelerou para além do que esperávamos.
693. I know what I said 3 months ago, mas o dano nervoso está, [regretful], a progredir mais rápido do que qualquer modelo previu e, pronto, precisamos de discutir o que isto significa para a tua carreira.
694. [empathetically] Well, as your brother first and your audiologist second, percebo o quão devastador isto é, [crying while speaking], especialmente quando o design de som tem sido a tua paixão desde a escola de cinema.
695. [whispering] Lamento muito.
696. [hesitantly] There are adaptive technologies, e sistemas de monitorização visual que te podem ajudar a continuar a trabalhar, embora eu saiba que não é o mesmo que confiar nos teus ouvidos.
697. [formal] The cochlear implant consultation is scheduled for Thursday, mas preciso que entendas que mesmo com cirurgia os, [slowly], resultados variam significativamente e não há garantia de que vás recuperar a, [monotone], gama de frequências necessária para trabalho de áudio profissional. [cough]
698. [stern] You need to stop viewing this as just a career issue, quando a tua perda auditiva está a afetar a tua, [worried], capacidade de comunicar com pessoas e envolver-te com o, [melancholic], mundo à tua volta para além do trabalho, sabes?
699. [cheerful] There's a whole community of deaf and hard-of-hearing filmmakers, que adaptaram o seu ofício de formas, [animated], incríveis que tu ainda não consideraste.
700. [playful] Remember when we were kids, e tu filmavas tudo com aquela câmara velha que tinha, [nostalgic], o áudio avariado mas ainda fazias aqueles filmes mudos incríveis apenas com, [excitedly], narrativa visual?
701. [sincerely] As your brother who's watched you reinvent yourself before, não tenho dúvidas de que vais encontrar uma forma de criar algo, [proudly], bonito desta perda mesmo que o caminho em frente pareça, [optimistic], completamente diferente do que imaginaste. [deep breath]
702. [confused] Oh meu Deus, há aqui um bebé, [anxious], como é que entraste aqui, [quickly], este edifício devia estar trancado!
703. [warm] Pronto pronto, shh shh, não percebo nada de bebés mas, [hesitantly], deixa-me pegar em ti, [gently], por favor não chores mais.
704. Bem, hum, pareces mais contente agora que alguém está a, [relieved], pegar em ti, quer dizer, embora eu devesse mesmo ligar a alguém sobre isto.
705. És mesmo, hum, até és giro quando não estás a, [smiling speaking], gritar, quer dizer, mesmo que isto seja definitivamente, [awkward], a noite mais estranha que já tive no trabalho.
706. Oh não, hum, não adormeças nos meus braços, quer dizer, [panicking], ainda preciso de descobrir, [worried], de onde vieste! [sigh]
707. [tender] Bem, hum, acho que os planos de desenvolvimento urbano podem, [slowly], esperar porque neste momento, ah, [empathetically], tu precisas mais de alguém do que este bairro precisa de mais um café. [chuckle]
708. [passionately] Sabes que mais, pequenino, talvez encontrar-te aqui seja, [thoughtful], um sinal de que esta comunidade precisa de mais do que apenas, [sincere], crescimento económico—precisa de lugares onde, [determined], as famílias se sintam seguras o suficiente para nunca abandonarem os seus bebés. [pause]
709. [formal] A polícia deve chegar em breve mas sinceramente, [regretful], vou ter saudades tuas.
710. [very sincerely] Talvez isto seja estranho mas pegar em ti, [emotional], fez-me lembrar porque é que entrei para o serviço público.
711. [bittersweet] Aí está o carro da polícia, hum, hora de, [sad], dizer adeus pequenino, bem, [very melancholic], espero que quem ficar contigo a seguir te ame como deve ser. [long pause]
712. A loja do teu primo foi só negócios, [defiant], nada pessoal, e tu ficares com a minha última nota de 100 não nos deixa quites.
713. [confident] Achas que andar a fazer batota no jogo das copinhas te torna, [mocking], algum tipo de filósofo de rua a dar lições de vida a criminosos?
714. Hum, sabes que mais, quer dizer, toda a gente neste bairro tem de sobreviver de alguma forma e, [quietly], o teu primo não era tão inocente como pensas, é, ele andava a passar produto pela mercearia e, [hesitant], a tirar uma parte pra ele.
715. [regretful] Olha, hum, as coisas fugiram ao controlo naquela noite, [anxious], mais do que eu planeava, e bem, nunca foi suposto os miúdos estarem lá, [whispering], deviam estar em casa da avó, percebes. [sigh]
716. [desperate] Então, ah, e agora, vais chamar a polícia ou, [nervous], vamos resolver isto à maneira da rua, porque, hum, de qualquer forma eu não saio daqui, [trailing off], sem o meu dinheiro de volta... [groan]
717. [threatening] Esta conversa não acabou e tu sabes disso, [loudly], porque ninguém me tira nada sem pagar o preço, [slow], nem mesmo um batoteiro de meia-tigela com ressentimentos. [laugh]
718. [contemplative] Talvez tenhas razão sobre as escolhas, hum, mas aqui fora, [sad], às vezes parece que todas as escolhas são más, e, ah, estamos só a escolher de que maneira queremos falhar, sabes.
719. Fazer as pazes, é, bem, hum, isso é um jogo perigoso no nosso mundo, [skeptical], especialmente quando já queimaste tantas pontes, ou seja. [sniffle]
720. Tu acreditas mesmo que pessoas como nós podem mudar, [doubtful], podem simplesmente decidir ser diferentes um dia e conseguir manter-se assim, [melancholic], porque eu já tentei antes e acabo sempre aqui outra vez, [exhausted], a repetir os mesmos padrões de sempre. [yawn]
721. [resigned] Talvez não sejas só um batoteiro afinal, [thoughtful], talvez sejas algo completamente diferente, e talvez, [quiet], eu precise de descobrir o que é que isso faz de mim.
