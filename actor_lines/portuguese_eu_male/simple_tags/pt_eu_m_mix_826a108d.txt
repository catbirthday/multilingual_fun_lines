Scenario: A videographer who has been documenting their own progressive hearing loss meets with their audiologist sister who must deliver the devastating news that the condition has accelerated beyond what medical intervention can help.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] I've been reviewing the footage I shot last month, [frustrated], e as faixas de áudio estão a ficar piores mesmo usando o mesmo, [shaky voice], equipamento e definições que sempre funcionaram perfeitamente para mim.

Character 2 [mix]: [warm] The test results came back yesterday, [anxious], e tenho estado a tentar perceber como te dizer que a deterioração, [quietly], acelerou para além do que esperávamos.

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] But you said the new hearing aids would give me at least, [angry], mais 1 ano antes de precisarmos considerar opções mais drásticas, [trembling], para o meu trabalho. [pause]

Character 2 [mix]: I know what I said 3 months ago, mas o dano nervoso está, [regretful], a progredir mais rápido do que qualquer modelo previu e, pronto, precisamos de discutir o que isto significa para a tua carreira.

Character 1 [mix]: [defensively] My entire life is built around capturing sound and image together, [upset], em perfeita harmonia e agora estás a dizer-me que os tratamentos que temos estado, [very quietly], a tentar há 2 anos de repente pararam completamente de funcionar. [sigh]

Character 2 [mix]: [empathetically] Well, as your brother first and your audiologist second, percebo o quão devastador isto é, [crying while speaking], especialmente quando o design de som tem sido a tua paixão desde a escola de cinema.

Character 1 [mix]: Every project I've shot lately, os clientes continuam a perguntar porque é que o áudio parece, [confused], desconectado dos visuais e eu não lhes posso dizer que é porque literalmente já não consigo ouvir o que estou a gravar, sabes?

Character 2 [mix]: [whispering] Lamento muito.

Character 1 [mix]: [coldly] Sorry doesn't fix the fact, que tenho 3 casamentos marcados para o próximo mês que provavelmente, [defeated], vou ter de cancelar. [groan]

Character 2 [mix]: [hesitantly] There are adaptive technologies, e sistemas de monitorização visual que te podem ajudar a continuar a trabalhar, embora eu saiba que não é o mesmo que confiar nos teus ouvidos.

Character 1 [mix]: You're suggesting I become a videographer who can't actually, [mocking], ouvir os momentos que estou a capturar como os votos ou os, [exhausted], discursos ou até a música que liga tudo emocionalmente, [trailing off], o que derrota completamente o propósito do que faço.

Character 2 [mix]: [formal] The cochlear implant consultation is scheduled for Thursday, mas preciso que entendas que mesmo com cirurgia os, [slowly], resultados variam significativamente e não há garantia de que vás recuperar a, [monotone], gama de frequências necessária para trabalho de áudio profissional. [cough]

Character 1 [mix]: [furious] I've spent 15 years building my reputation, como alguém que captura as, [passionate], nuances de áudio subtis que outros videógrafos perdem e agora, estás basicamente a dizer-me que a minha carreira está, [very sadly], acabada.

Character 2 [mix]: [stern] You need to stop viewing this as just a career issue, quando a tua perda auditiva está a afetar a tua, [worried], capacidade de comunicar com pessoas e envolver-te com o, [melancholic], mundo à tua volta para além do trabalho, sabes?

Character 1 [mix]: [apologetic] You're right that I've been so focused on saving my business, que não, [relieved], processei realmente o que isto significa para o resto da minha vida.

Character 2 [mix]: [cheerful] There's a whole community of deaf and hard-of-hearing filmmakers, que adaptaram o seu ofício de formas, [animated], incríveis que tu ainda não consideraste.

Character 1 [mix]: [curious] Maybe I've been so terrified of losing what I had, que não consegui, [hopeful], ver nenhuma possibilidade além disso. [laugh]

Character 2 [mix]: [playful] Remember when we were kids, e tu filmavas tudo com aquela câmara velha que tinha, [nostalgic], o áudio avariado mas ainda fazias aqueles filmes mudos incríveis apenas com, [excitedly], narrativa visual?

Character 1 [mix]: Yeah, before I learned about sound design, eu era bastante bom a contar histórias através de, [confident], imagem pura e talvez seja altura de redescobrir essa parte da, [thoughtful], minha visão artística que ficou enterrada sob toda a perícia técnica de áudio, que pensei que me definia.

Character 2 [mix]: [sincerely] As your brother who's watched you reinvent yourself before, não tenho dúvidas de que vais encontrar uma forma de criar algo, [proudly], bonito desta perda mesmo que o caminho em frente pareça, [optimistic], completamente diferente do que imaginaste. [deep breath]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [bitter] I've been reviewing the footage I shot last month and the, [frustrated], audio tracks are getting worse even though I'm using the same, [shaky voice], equipment and settings that have always worked perfectly for me.

Character 2: [warm] The test results came back yesterday and I've been, [anxious], trying to figure out how to tell you that the deterioration has, [quietly], accelerated beyond what we hoped.

Character 1: [desperate] But you said the new hearing aids would give me at least, [angry], another year before we'd need to consider more drastic, [trembling], options for my work. [pause]

Character 2: I know, um, what I said three months ago but the nerve damage is, [regretful], progressing faster than any of the models predicted and, well, we need to discuss what this means for your career.

Character 1: [defensively] My entire life is built around capturing sound and image together in perfect, [upset], harmony and now you're telling me that the treatments we've been, [very quietly], trying for two years have suddenly just stopped working entirely. [sigh]

Character 2: [empathetically] Well, I mean, as your sister first and your audiologist second, um, I understand how devastating this is, [crying while speaking], especially when sound design has been your passion since film school.

Character 1: Um, every project I've shot lately, well, the clients keep asking why the audio feels, [confused], disconnected from the visuals and I can't tell them it's because I literally can't hear what I'm recording anymore, you know?

Character 2: [whispering] I'm so sorry.

Character 1: [coldly] Sorry doesn't fix the fact that, um, I have three weddings booked next month that I'll probably, [defeated], have to cancel. [groan]

Character 2: [hesitantly] Er, there are adaptive technologies and, umm, visual monitoring systems that could help you continue working, though I know it's not the same as relying on your ears.

Character 1: You're suggesting I become a videographer who can't actually, [mocking], hear the moments I'm capturing like the vows or the, [exhausted], speeches or even the music that ties everything together emotionally, [trailing off], which defeats the entire purpose of what I do.

Character 2: [formal] The cochlear implant consultation is scheduled for Thursday but I need you to understand that even with surgery the, [slowly], results vary significantly and there's no guarantee you'll recover the, [monotone], frequency range needed for professional audio work. [cough]

Character 1: [furious] Well, um, I've spent fifteen years building my reputation as someone who captures the, [passionate], subtle audio nuances that other videographers miss and now, er, you're basically telling me my career is, [very sadly], over.

Character 2: [stern] I mean, you need to stop viewing this as just a career issue when, um, your hearing loss is affecting your, [worried], ability to communicate with people and engage with the, [melancholic], world around you beyond just work, you know?

Character 1: [apologetic] You're right that I've been so focused on saving my business that I haven't, [relieved], really processed what this means for the rest of my life.

Character 2: [cheerful] There's a whole community of deaf and hard-of-hearing filmmakers who've adapted their craft in, [animated], incredible ways that you might not have considered yet.

Character 1: [curious] Maybe I've been so terrified of losing what I had that I couldn't, [hopeful], see any possibilities beyond it. [laugh]

Character 2: [playful] Remember when we were kids and you used to film everything with that old camcorder that had, [nostalgic], broken audio but you still made those amazing silent films with just, [excitedly], visual storytelling?

Character 1: Um, yeah, I mean, before I learned about sound design, er, I was actually pretty good at telling stories through, [confident], pure imagery and maybe it's time to rediscover that part of, [thoughtful], my artistic vision that got buried under all the technical audio expertise, well, that I thought defined me.

Character 2: [sincerely] Well, you know, as your sister who's watched you reinvent yourself before, um, I have no doubt you'll find a way to create something, [proudly], beautiful from this loss even if the path forward looks, [optimistic], completely different than what you imagined. [deep breath]
