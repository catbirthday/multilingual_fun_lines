Scenario: A grandson visits his dying grandfather, a former jazz musician, who reveals he's leaving his prized saxophone collection to him instead of to the grandson's father who expected them.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Grandpa, the nurses said you, um, wanted to talk to me about something important? [quietly] Dad's parking the car, he'll be up in a minute if you want to wait for him.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] No, no, this is between you and me, kid. [clearing throat] Come closer, these damn hospital beds make everyone feel like they're shouting across a canyon, and I need you to really hear this.

Character 1 [en]: Is this about, err, the arrangements? Because Mom and Dad already told me they've got everything handled with the funeral home and, uhh, all that stuff you're not supposed to talk about.

Character 2 [en]: [chuckling] Death talk doesn't scare me anymore, but no, this is about life. [firmly] More specifically, it's about those three saxophone cases in my basement that your father's been eyeing for the past thirty years.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] The ones in the music room? I mean, Dad always said those were going to be his when... well, when the time came. He's already talking about selling the Selmer to that collector in Chicago.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Of course he is. [sighs] Your father never understood that those horns aren't just metal and mother-of-pearl, they're, ahh, they're every smoky club I played in, every song your grandmother danced to. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [anxiously] Grandpa, I don't want to get in the middle of something between you and Dad. You know how he gets about, um, inheritance stuff, especially after what happened with Uncle Jerry and the house.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Listen to me, because I'm only going to say this once. [slowly] Those saxophones are going to you, not him, and the paperwork's already done, notarized last week when your aunt drove me to the lawyer. [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] What? But I don't even—Grandpa, I haven't played music since middle school band! [nervously] Dad's going to absolutely lose it when he finds out you gave them to me instead.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] Your father sees dollar signs, but you, ahh, you used to sit in that basement for hours when you were little, just running your fingers over those keys, listening to my old records. [whispering] Music chooses people, kid, not the other way around.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] That was different, I was just a kid messing around! [shaky voice] I mean, those instruments are worth, what, fifty thousand dollars? Maybe more? I can't accept something like that when I don't even know how to play them properly.

Character 2 [en]: [sternly] The 1962 Mark VI alone could pay for your college loans, but that's exactly why I'm not giving them to your father. [empathetically] He'd sell them before my body was cold, and those horns deserve to sing again, not sit in some collector's climate-controlled vault. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] He'd never forgive me.

Character 2 [en]: [laughing] He never forgave me for choosing jazz over his mother's idea of a respectable career, so we're even. [warmly] Look, I've got maybe a week left if I'm lucky, and I need to know those instruments will be with someone who might, just might, learn to love them.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] You can't just drop this on me and then—and then leave! [frustrated] I don't know the first thing about maintaining vintage saxophones or, or even how to hold one properly anymore. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] There's a shoebox in the case with the Selmer, full of napkins from every club I ever played. [chuckles] Each one has the date, the songs, who was there. Your grandmother kept them all, said it was better than a photo album.

Character 1 [en]: [sniffling] Why are you telling me this now? [sighs] Why not years ago when you could have actually taught me to play them, when we had time?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Because I was a stubborn old fool who thought I had more time, who thought maybe your father would come around. [slowly] But watching you walk in here just now, the way you still look at me like I'm somebody special instead of just another dying old man, I knew.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Grandpa, I, I'll try to learn, okay? [trembling] I'll find a teacher, maybe that guy you used to play with at the Blue Room, if he's still around. I won't let them just sit there collecting dust.

Character 2 [en]: [peacefully] Tommy Morrison, he's still teaching, lives over on Riverside now. [very slowly] Tell him Eddie's grandson needs to learn what it means to make a horn weep, and he'll understand. [long pause] Now go on, your father's probably wondering what's taking so long.
