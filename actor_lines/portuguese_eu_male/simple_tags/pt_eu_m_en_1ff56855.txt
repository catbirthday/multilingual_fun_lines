Scenario: An aspiring writer video-calls their successful novelist partner overseas to admit they're giving up on their dream after another crushing rejection, unaware their partner has secretly submitted their work to their own publisher.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] I got another rejection today, this time from, [shaky voice], that small press you said would be perfect for my work, and I just, [defeated], can't keep pretending I have what it takes to be a real writer.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Listen, um, I know how crushing these rejections feel, but, like, [gently], your writing has something special that, well, [passionate], most people take years to develop, and um, I really believe in your voice.

Character 1 [en]: Well, maybe you're just saying that because, um, you love me and, like, [frustrated], you don't want to admit your partner is a failure, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Being thousands of miles away makes it harder to, [pause], show you how much I genuinely respect your work beyond just loving you.

Character 1 [en]: You've published three novels already and here I am, [embarrassed], still getting form rejections that don't even, [very quietly], mention anything specific about my writing, just that generic, [trailing off], 'not right for us at this time' nonsense.

Character 2 [en]: Um, the publishing world is, like, [hesitantly], incredibly subjective and timing matters so much more than, well, [anxious], talent sometimes, which is why, umm, [clearing throat], I need to tell you something important.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What do you mean you need to, [nervous], tell me something—did you do something with, [speeding up], my manuscript without asking me first?

Character 2 [en]: I, um, might have shown your latest story to, like, [apologetic], my editor when she was asking about new voices, and, well, [excited], she wants to meet with you next week, um, if you're interested.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] So you just, um, went behind my back and used your, like, [loudly], connections to get me a pity meeting that I didn't, well, [hurt], earn on my own merit? I mean, that's exactly what I was afraid of!

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] No, I mean, I simply gave her your work without, like, [stern], mentioning our relationship at all, and um, she loved it based purely on, well, [confidently], the quality of your writing, nothing else.

Character 1 [en]: But um, how am I supposed to know if, like, [uncertain], any success I might have is real or just, well, [whispering], because I'm dating someone famous who, umm, [sigh], pulled strings for me?

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Because, um, I've watched you pour your soul into every page for, like, [proud], three years now, and well, talent like yours doesn't need my name attached to succeed.

Character 1 [en]: I don't know if I can, um, believe that when everyone will think, like, [melancholic], I only got published because of who I'm with, not because I actually, well, [very sad], deserve it on my own. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Look, I mean, the meeting is yours to take or leave, but um, [rationally], my editor has rejected work from my own friends before, so like, [honest], she wouldn't waste her time if she didn't see real potential in you.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Um, I just—[gasp]

Character 2 [en]: I know being apart makes you, um, doubt yourself more, but like, [loving], I see your brilliance even from across the ocean. I mean, that's never changed.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Maybe you're right.

Character 2 [en]: Take the meeting and let your work, [determined], speak for itself—that's all I'm, [supportive], asking you to do.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Okay, um, I'll take the meeting, but like, [hopeful], only if she truly doesn't know about us, because I mean, I need this to be mine.

Character 2 [en]: It already is yours, every beautiful, [tender], word of it, and soon everyone else will, [smile], know that too.
