Scenario: A runaway kid hiding in a print shop after hours is discovered by the night shift digital press operator who recognizes them from missing person flyers they've been printing all week.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [startled] Please don't call anyone, I'll just, [shaky voice], leave right now and you can pretend you never saw me hiding behind those paper rolls.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Well, um, I've been printing your face, [confused], all week long on these missing person flyers, so, I mean, thousands of copies with your school photo and, [quietly], that same jacket you're wearing right now. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Um, those flyers are, like, everywhere but nobody actually, [bitter], looks at them anyway, they just, you know, [frustrated], walk past like I'm already gone. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Your mom came in here, um, three times to check the print quality, and well, she kept, [trembling], touching your photo on the proof sheets like she was trying to, [very quietly], memorize every detail before you disappeared completely. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] She actually cares?

Character 2 [en]: The ink on these machines costs more than my, [hesitantly], rent but she insisted on the highest quality because she said your eyes needed to look, [warm], exactly right so people would recognize you.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] I've been sleeping here for four nights between the, [exhausted], paper storage shelves and watching you work the machines, [slowly], wondering if you'd eventually notice me.

Character 2 [en]: Kid, I mean, I noticed you the first night but, um, figured anyone desperate enough to, [regretful], sleep in a print shop probably had, well, [concerned], nowhere else safe to go, so I just, you know, [trailing off], kept the heat on and left some food by the break room.

Character 1 [en]: You, [shocked], knew?

Character 2 [en]: [gently] These machines have motion sensors that alert my phone, and besides, [chuckle], you left chocolate fingerprints on the paper cutter which is, [amused], definitely not part of my usual maintenance routine.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Um, I tried to stay out of your way and, well, not touch anything important.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] You know, um, I ran away once too when I was, like, about your age, and someone at a, [nostalgic], diner let me wash dishes for food instead of calling the cops.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] So, um, you're not going to, I mean, turn me in or, you know, call my parents right now? [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: First, let's get you something better than vending machine chips to, [caring], eat while we figure out what's really going on at, [serious], home that made you run. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: My stepdad keeps saying I'm not really, [angry], part of the family and that my mom would be, [crying while speaking], happier if I just disappeared.

Character 2 [en]: Well, umm, a woman who spends her savings on, like, premium flyers and comes here crying doesn't, [firmly], sound like someone who wants their kid gone, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Maybe she just didn't know how to, [uncertain], stand up to him when he said those things. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Tomorrow morning, we're printing a special edition that says you've been, [relieved], found safe. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] You'd really help me go back, [scared], even though things might not change with him there?

Character 2 [en]: Change starts when people know they're not, [determined], alone in seeing what's wrong, and your mom needs to, [passionately], hear what you just told me before it's, [urgently], too late to fix this family.
