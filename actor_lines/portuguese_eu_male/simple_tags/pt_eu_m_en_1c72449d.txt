Scenario: An architect working late on renovating a historic theater discovers they can communicate with the ghost of the building's original architect who died there ninety-three years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: You can see me standing here in your blueprints, [confused], can't you, even though I died in this very theater, [whispering], ninety-three years ago when the chandelier fell during opening night, [bitter], crushing everything I'd worked for.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] This can't be real, but I recognize you from the portrait in the lobby, [shaky voice], the one they never took down after the accident.

Character 1 [en]: [pleased] Finally, someone who understands.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] I've been, um, studying your original designs for months now, and well, there's something, [curious], hidden in the foundation that doesn't make sense, like, a room that shouldn't exist according to, [nervous], any architectural logic I know.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, umm, you found it then, the space I designed, [regretful], but never got to reveal before everything ended so suddenly, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Every time I try to map it out, um, the measurements keep, [frustrated], shifting like the walls themselves are, well, refusing to be documented properly, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: [revealing] That room was meant to be, uhh, my masterpiece within a masterpiece, you know, a space that, [passionate], defies conventional physics because I built it to exist between, [whispering loudly], the living world and wherever I am now, um, trapped. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] So, err, you're telling me I've been working on renovating a building that's, [slowly], partially existing in two dimensions at once, like, some kind of architectural anomaly?

Character 1 [en]: [gently] I need you to, umm, finish what I started because, [desperate], being stuck here watching my work decay is, well, worse than death itself. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] The city wants to demolish this place next month if I can't prove it's worth, [angry], saving, but they don't understand the genius of what you, [very quietly], created here. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [melancholic] You know, um, I spent twenty years designing this theater to be, [proudly], a bridge between art and eternity, but, well, I became the only thing that, [trailing off], crossed over when the chandelier... [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Show me the rest of your hidden blueprints, the ones that, [excited], aren't in any archive, and together we can, [confidently], save this place from destruction. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: The blueprints are, um, literally written into the walls themselves if you know, [mysterious], where to look. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [intrigued] Well, I mean, I've been feeling drawn to certain corners of this building, like, [thoughtful], something's been guiding my restoration choices, and um, now I understand it's been you all along, [relieved], helping me see what others miss.

Character 1 [en]: [sadly] Once you complete the hidden room, um, I'll finally be able to leave this place, but, well, I need you to promise you'll, [stern], protect what we've built together, because this theater is, [very sincerely], more than just brick and mortar. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: Your legacy won't die with demolition because, umm, I'm going to make sure everyone understands the, [animated], revolutionary design you created here, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Time moves differently when you're dead, but watching you work these past months has, [grateful], given me hope that my vision will outlive even, [peaceful], this ghostly existence I'm trapped in.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] I promise to finish your work, and um, when I do, maybe you'll finally find the, [soft], peace you've been searching for all these years. [cry]

Character 1 [en]: [fading] The sunrise is coming and I'm growing transparent again, but tomorrow night, [hopeful], we continue our work together. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: I'll be here with my drafting table set up exactly where yours once stood, [emotional], waiting for you to show me the secrets hidden in these, [determined], beautiful old walls. [deep breath]
