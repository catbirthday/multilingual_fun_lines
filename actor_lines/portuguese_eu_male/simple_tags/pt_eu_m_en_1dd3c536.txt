=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Derek Ramirez? Um, I'm Officer Chen from the Electronic Monitoring Division. I'm here to— [pause] Wait, Derek? Derek from Roosevelt High?

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Holy shit, Amy Chen? [laughs] Man, this is not how I pictured our ten-year reunion going, you know? Though I guess it's kind of fitting that you're the one putting me on a leash.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] God, I can't believe it's you. [sighs] Look, I, uh, I need to come in and set up the monitoring equipment, but this is really weird, I mean, seeing you like this after all these years.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically] Yeah, welcome to Casa de Derek, where the jokes are still bad and the, um, circumstances are significantly worse than senior year. [quieter] Come on in, I guess, Officer Chen.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] You don't have to call me that, it's still just Amy. [pause] Listen, I know this situation sucks, but we need to get through the installation and, uh, I'll explain how everything works, okay?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Right. Sure. Whatever.

Character 1 [en]: [professionally] So the device needs to be charged for two hours daily, and you can't go more than, um, a hundred feet from the base unit here. [trailing off] Derek, what happened? You were heading to art school...

Character 2 [en]: Art school didn't pan out, obviously. [bitter laugh] Turns out making people laugh in chemistry class doesn't translate to, like, actual marketable skills, so I started dealing to make rent and, well, here we are.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] That's not true.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] What?

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] About the laughing.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Amy, I made stupid fart noises with the Bunsen burners and drew cartoons of Mr. Peterson on the board. [sighs] That wasn't exactly changing the world or anything important, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] Junior year, when my mom was dying of cancer and I couldn't tell anyone, your stupid jokes were literally the only thing that got me through each day. [pause] You have no idea how much those moments mattered.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I, uh... I didn't know about your mom, Amy. [very quietly] Jesus, I'm so sorry, I would've—I mean, if I'd known, I would've done something more than just crack jokes.

Character 1 [en]: The jokes were enough, Derek. [warmly] Look, um, the monitoring period is six months, but with good behavior it can be reduced, and there are job training programs I can connect you with, if you want.

Character 2 [en]: [hopefully] You'd do that? Even though I'm just another, uh, another case file in your system now? Because honestly, Amy, I could really use someone who doesn't see me as just this massive fuck-up.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You're not a fuck-up, you're someone who made bad choices when things got hard. [sighs] There's a difference, and yeah, I'll help however I can, because that's what friends do.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] Friends? [laughs through tears] Man, I haven't heard anyone call me that in, like, two years. Most people just see the ankle monitor and assume I'm trash, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Well, they're idiots then. [chuckles] The Derek I remember could light up any room, even when everything seemed hopeless, and, um, that person is still in there somewhere, ankle monitor or not.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Thanks, Amy. [pause] Hey, remember when I accidentally set off the fire alarm trying to make s'mores in chemistry? [laughs] Maybe we can grab coffee sometime and I can tell you what really happened that day.
