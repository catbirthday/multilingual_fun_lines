Character 1 [en]: The bill is forty-seven [quickly] eighty-three. What's twenty percent?

Character 2 [en]: Jesus Christ, you serious? Move the decimal, double it—nine-fifty-six. Any third-grader with half a brain cell could figure that out without making it a whole production.

Character 1 [en]: Nine fifty-six? That's, um, way too much for chicken that tasted like, you know, cardboard.

Character 2 [en]: Cardboard? You ordered the safest thing on the menu because you're terrified of flavor. Sarah didn't judge your boring-ass palate, so pay the woman her twenty percent.

Character 1 [en]: She forgot my salad, er, entirely until I had to, like, wave her down twice!

Character 2 [en]: Oh boo-fucking-hoo, she forgot your, hmm, three leaves of iceberg lettuce. Meanwhile she's juggling twelve tables because, actually, management fired half the staff last week—I mean, cut her some slack.

Character 1 [en]: Fifteen percent then? That's, well, about seven dollars which seems, you know, more reasonable for the, uh, actual service we got?

Character 2 [en]: Seven dollars? Are you, like, fucking kidding me right now? She spent two hours pretending your stupid jokes were funny—honestly, that alone deserves hazard pay, so, twenty percent minimum.

Character 1 [en]: Fine! But I'm not, err, tipping on the wine that was already, basically, marked up three hundred percent.

Character 2 [en]: The wine you insisted on ordering to impress your date who left after the appetizer? Yeah, you tip on that humiliation tax too, buddy.

Character 1 [en]: Twenty-three dollars for house wine is [delighted] highway robbery!

Character 2 [en]: Highway robbery is you thinking, umm, anyone gives a shit about your, actually, cheap-ass complaints when Sarah's trying to pay rent on two-thirteen an hour plus whatever scraps people like you leave.

Character 1 [en]: What if we just leave ten bucks?

Character 2 [en]: Ten bucks works—congratulations, you just spent five minutes bitching your way to exactly what I said in the first place. Real smooth negotiation skills there, champ.

Character 1 [en]: Wait... you just, like, rounded up the bill! It's forty-seven dollars, so, er, ten is actually more than twenty percent!

Character 2 [en]: No shit, Sherlock—servers tip out on total sales including, well, tax, which means they're paying the busboy and bartender whether you, honestly, tip properly or not, so yeah, we round up.

Character 1 [en]: This is [passionately] why I hate, you know, going out with you—everything becomes this, um, whole moral crusade!

Character 2 [en]: Moral crusade? I'm just, basically, trying to make sure our server can, hmm, afford groceries while you're crying over two extra dollars like it's your kidney.

Character 1 [en]: Fine! Ten dollars—but, actually, you're paying for parking since you're so, well, goddamn generous with my money.

Character 2 [en]: Your money? You still owe me forty from last week's bar tab, but sure—I'll cover parking while you, err, pretend you're not the cheapest bastard I know, honestly.
