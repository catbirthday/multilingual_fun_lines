Character 1 [en]: So you're the guy who caught [exhausted] the bouquet at my sister's wedding last year.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, that was your sister's wedding? Small world—I still have that bouquet pressed in a book somewhere, which sounds way creepier than I meant it to. I'm Marcus, by the way.

Character 1 [en]: You kept it? That's [cough] actually kind of sweet. I'm Riley.

Character 2 [en]: Nice to meet you, Riley. So are you participating in this medieval torture ritual they call a garter toss, or are you just here for moral support?

Character 1 [en]: Oh god, I'm in it. My cousin made all the single guys promise.

Character 2 [en]: Well, the thing is, I'm [loudly] supposed to be catching this thing too, you know, because apparently my aunt thinks, um, twenty-eight is basically ancient for a bachelor. She literally pushed me onto the dance floor just now.

Character 1 [en]: Twenty-eight? Try thirty-two. My mom introduced me to three different women during cocktail hour.

Character 2 [en]: Three? That's, uh, impressive efficiency on her part. My record is five at my cousin's bar mitzvah, but, I mean, that was a six-hour event so she had more time to work with.

Character 1 [en]: Did you, like, actually date any of them? I'm, err, curious because my success rate with these setups is, honestly, zero.

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely not—one was, hmm, my dentist's daughter who spent twenty minutes describing her cat's anxiety medication, and another one, well, turned out to be my ex's new roommate. The universe has a twisted sense of humor sometimes.

Character 1 [en]: That's brutal. Though not as bad as the time my dad set me up with his accountant's daughter at Thanksgiving.

Character 2 [en]: Thanksgiving setup? That's advanced level parent meddling right there. At least at weddings you can escape to the bar—at Thanksgiving you're trapped until the pie comes out.

Character 1 [en]: She brought a PowerPoint about, um, her five-year plan. It had, you know, animated transitions and, actually, a timeline for kids.

Character 2 [en]: A PowerPoint presentation at Thanksgiving dinner? That's simultaneously the most terrifying and impressive thing I've ever heard. Did she at least have good slide design?

Character 1 [en]: The fonts were, I guess, [formal] professionally chosen and, well, the color scheme was actually quite pleasant.

Character 2 [en]: You know what, I respect the commitment to branding. If you're going to scare someone off, might as well do it with style and proper kerning.

Character 1 [en]: Oh shit, they're starting. DJ just called all the single guys.

Character 2 [en]: Here we go—time to, basically, pretend we want to catch a piece of lace while, you know, twenty drunk relatives cheer like it's the damn Super Bowl.

Character 1 [en]: Want to make a pact? Whoever catches it, um, [friendly] buys the other a drink to, sort of, commiserate about this whole ridiculous tradition?

Character 2 [en]: Deal—though fair warning, I have surprisingly good reflexes when alcohol and peer pressure are involved. My catching-random-wedding-objects record is currently two and zero.
