Character 1 [en]: So, um, have you really gotten rid of, like, half your stuff? That seems, honestly, pretty extreme.

Character 2 [en]: Well, it happened gradually over [shaky voice] about six months. Once I started really looking at what I actually used versus what just sat there collecting dust, the decisions became surprisingly easy.

Character 1 [en]: But what about [anxious] sentimental things? Family heirlooms?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, those are harder, you know, but I kept the truly meaningful ones. Like, I had boxes of old cards I never looked at, so I photographed them and, actually, kept just three that really mattered.

Character 1 [en]: Doesn't your place feel empty now?

Character 2 [en]: Not at all - it feels [yawn] peaceful actually. There's something really calming about having only things you love and use, plus cleaning takes maybe fifteen minutes now instead of hours.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, what about, er, hobbies? Don't you need, well, equipment and supplies for things?

Character 2 [en]: Sure, but I realized I was, hmm, holding onto hobbies I'd abandoned years ago. Like, I had watercolor supplies from 2015 that I kept thinking I'd use someday, but, honestly, I never did.

Character 1 [en]: Did you regret [crying while speaking] getting rid of anything?

Character 2 [en]: Maybe one or two small things, but nothing major. The mental clarity I gained from not having all that stuff weighing on me mentally has been worth any minor regrets.

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, how do you, basically, handle gifts now? People must, um, still give you things.

Character 2 [en]: I've started asking for experiences instead - concert tickets, restaurant gift cards, donations to causes I care about. Most people actually appreciate not having to shop for physical items.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, you [gasp] ask people not to give you presents?

Character 2 [en]: Not exactly - I just share what would make me happiest when people ask. It's about being intentional with what comes into my space rather than accumulating things out of politeness.

Character 1 [en]: But, uh, what about books? I mean, you can't just, like, get rid of books, right?

Character 2 [en]: Books were my weakness too, actually, but I kept maybe thirty favorites and, you know, use the library for everything else now. It's, er, pretty liberating not having to dust hundreds of books.

Character 1 [en]: So, the thing is, doesn't this lifestyle feel, hmm, restrictive? Like you're, basically, always saying no to things?

Character 2 [en]: It's more like saying yes to what matters, honestly. I have more money for travel now, more time because I'm not managing stuff, and, well, more mental space for actual experiences.

Character 1 [en]: How much money do you think you've saved?

Character 2 [en]: Between not buying unnecessary things and, um, selling what I had, probably around eight thousand dollars this year. But really, the time I've gotten back is, you know, even more valuable than the money.
