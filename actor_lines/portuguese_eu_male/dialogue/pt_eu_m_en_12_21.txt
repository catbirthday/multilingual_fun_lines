Character 1 [en]: Oh wow, um, this is [very excited] amazing, you know, I've never seen a mind reading act, er, up close like this before!

Character 2 [en]: Welcome to the mystical corner of our festival! I'm about to demonstrate something [long pause] extraordinary with numbers, but first, let me ask you to think of any number between one and a thousand.

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, I'm thinking of one, uh, but like, how could you possibly know what it is?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, the skepticism is natural, you know, but here's the thing, numbers have vibrations, actually, that most people can't perceive. Your number is... three hundred and forty-seven, and you chose it because it has personal significance, perhaps a date?

Character 1 [en]: That's... that's exactly right! How did you do that?

Character 2 [en]: Trade secret, my friend, but anyway, let me show you something else, er, even more fascinating, honestly. Pick a card from this deck, memorize it, and I'll tell you not just the card but the number you're visualizing on it.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I've got it, um, but I mean, there's no way you could, actually, see what I'm thinking.

Character 2 [en]: Seven of hearts, and hmm, you're imagining the number seven glowing, sort of, in gold, right? That's because, well, your mind associates that number with luck or maybe a birthday in July?

Character 1 [en]: This is, uh, completely impossible, but like, you're getting everything right, so, how are you doing this?

Character 2 [en]: Years of practice reading micro-expressions, body language, [relieved] and honestly, a bit of showmanship never hurts, you know? But here's where it gets really interesting - I want you to write down any four-digit number on this paper without showing me.

Character 1 [en]: Alright, I wrote it down. Now what?

Character 2 [en]: Fold it up, hold it tight, and basically, I'm going to attempt something, er, I rarely do in public, okay so, just concentrate on those digits. Two... nine... four... eight. Your birth year perhaps?

Character 1 [en]: I can't, um, even process this, like, are you actually psychic or, I mean, is this some kind of trick?

Character 2 [en]: The beautiful thing about illusion is that it lives in the space between reality and impossibility. Now, for my finale, I need you to multiply your age by two, add five, then multiply by fifty.

Character 1 [en]: Okay, uh, I did the math, and actually, I got, well, a pretty big number here.

Character 2 [en]: One thousand seven hundred and fifty, which means you're thirty years old, born in nineteen ninety-four, which connects beautifully to that number you wrote earlier, doesn't it?

Character 1 [en]: You just, like, [excited] blew my mind completely, and honestly, I don't know whether to, um, applaud or run away!

Character 2 [en]: Most people have that reaction, but here's the thing, err, the real magic isn't in the tricks themselves, you know, it's in reminding people that the world is full of wonder. Would you like to learn one simple number trick to amaze your friends?

Character 1 [en]: Yes, absolutely! Teach me something!

Character 2 [en]: Perfect! Take any three-digit number, reverse it, subtract the smaller from the larger, and the answer will always be divisible by ninety-nine - mathematics disguised as magic, but don't tell anyone that secret.
