Character 1 [en]: So I've been analyzing the numbers from Le Bernardin and comparing them to what we're doing at Blue Hill. The labor cost percentages are completely different.

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, well, Le Bernardin runs like, what, thirty-eight percent labor costs because of their service model? They've got one server for every two tables during peak hours, plus the whole brigade system Eric Ripert inherited from Gilbert Le Coze.

Character 1 [en]: Right. I mapped out their entire front-of-house structure. They have fourteen distinct positions just for service.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Sorry, I should've mentioned earlier—I actually worked under their sommelier for six months. Their wine program alone requires three dedicated staff members per shift, which, um, definitely inflates those percentages compared to somewhere like Eleven Madison Park.

Character 1 [en]: Eleven Madison runs leaner though. Will Guidara restructured everything when they went tasting menu only.

Character 2 [en]: [cheerful] Exactly! Danny Meyer's whole Union Square Hospitality Group philosophy is about, uh, "enlightened hospitality" but with efficiency built in. They cross-train everyone—your bartender at Gramercy Tavern can work garde manger if needed, which you'd never see at Daniel or Jean-Georges.

Character 1 [en]: I've been documenting how Momofuku handles inventory. David Chang's system is interesting.

Character 2 [en]: Momofuku's, hmm, kind of revolutionary in how they centralize purchasing across Ssäm Bar, Ko, and Noodle Bar. They negotiate bulk deals with Pat LaFrieda for meat, then distribute based on, uh, projected covers rather than individual restaurant orders.

Character 1 [en]: The Spotted Pig does something similar with April Bloomfield's other restaurants, correct?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, yeah, though Ken Friedman's management style is, well, let's just say different from how Thomas Keller runs The French Laundry and Per Se. Keller's got everything documented down to how many inches apart plates should be.

Character 1 [en]: I have Keller's entire operations manual. Every procedure is timestamped and measured.

Character 2 [en]: That level of precision is why, um, Bouchon Bakery can replicate exact results whether you're in Yountville, Las Vegas, or Hudson Yards. Meanwhile, someone like José Andrés at ThinkFoodGroup is more, I guess, fluid with letting each concept evolve independently.

Character 1 [en]: What about scheduling software? I noticed Chez Panisse still uses paper schedules.

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] Alice Waters refuses to modernize certain things and, honestly, they're hemorrhaging money because of it. They could save probably forty thousand annually just by switching to 7shifts or HotSchedules like what Marcus Samuelsson uses at Red Rooster.

Character 1 [en]: Marcus has five restaurants now. Red Rooster, Streetbird, Marcus B&P, plus the two in Europe.

Character 2 [en]: And he manages all of them through, uh, centralized systems he developed with his partners at Samuelsson Group. It's nothing like how someone like Bobby Flay operates—Flay basically lets each location of Gato or Mesa Grill run semi-autonomously.

Character 1 [en]: I've been studying NoMad's expansion model too. They seem more methodical.

Character 2 [en]: [gasp loudly] Wait, you know NoMad just announced they're closing the original location? But yeah, their, um, their expansion into Los Angeles and Las Vegas was super calculated—they spent months analyzing labor markets and supplier networks before committing.

Character 1 [en]: That's exactly what I'm proposing for our expansion. Map everything first, like how Shake Shack planned their rollout.

Character 2 [en]: [playful] Look at you getting all Randy Garutti on me! Though honestly, comparing QSR expansion to what, uh, someone like Grant Achatz does with Next and Alinea is kind of apples and oranges, but I see where you're going with the systematic approach.
