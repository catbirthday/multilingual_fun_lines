Character 1 [en]: So tell me about your experience as a silversmith.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I've been working with silver for, um, about twelve years now, and honestly, I started out making maybe twenty pieces a month but now I'm producing around eighty to ninety custom pieces monthly.

Character 1 [en]: That's quite an increase in production.

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, I mean, when I opened my first studio in 2015, er, I was charging maybe $45 per piece, but you know, now my average commission runs between $350 and $1,200 depending on complexity.

Character 1 [en]: How many employees do you [pause] currently manage?

Character 2 [en]: Right now I have a team of six artisans working under me, and we handle about 300 client orders quarterly, which keeps us all pretty busy but not overwhelmed.

Character 1 [en]: So, what's your, uhh, typical profit margin, I guess, on these pieces?

Character 2 [en]: Most silver jewelry runs about a 60% profit margin after materials and labor, though custom wedding bands can go up to 75% because clients value that personal touch.

Character 1 [en]: What about material costs?

Character 2 [en]: Silver's trading at around $24 per ounce right now, and a typical ring uses maybe 0.3 ounces, so material cost is only $7-8 but the real value comes from the craftsmanship.

Character 1 [en]: How long does it take to complete a piece?

Character 2 [en]: Well, a simple band takes, hmm, maybe three hours, but actually, complex designs with stones, you know, can take fifteen to twenty hours spread over several days.

Character 1 [en]: What's your most expensive creation?

Character 2 [en]: Oh that would be, er, a $12,000 [sarcastic] "simple" tea set that took me, basically, four months to complete because the client kept changing their mind about the engravings.

Character 1 [en]: Four months sounds, um, [cry loudly] exhausting, I mean, how did you manage that?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly, I broke it down into, like, weekly milestones and charged them, uhh, an extra 30% for revisions, so it ended up being quite profitable despite the headaches.

Character 1 [en]: Right so, what percentage of your business is, err, custom work versus, you know, ready-made pieces?

Character 2 [en]: About 70% custom and 30% [hesitantly] ready-made, though I'm trying to shift that to 50-50 because the ready-made pieces have better margins and less client drama.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, how many pieces do you, actually, keep in inventory, sort of, at any given time?

Character 2 [en]: Usually around, well, 150 to 200 pieces worth maybe, uh, $40,000 total, though honestly, during holiday season I'll stock up to 300 pieces because December accounts for 35% of annual sales.
