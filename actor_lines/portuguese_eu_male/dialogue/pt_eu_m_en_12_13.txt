Character 1 [en]: [sniffle] So you're the new temp they sent over? I heard you've already made quite an impression!

Character 2 [en]: Yes, that's my temp. Been here since seven this morning, already cleared three months of backlog that nobody else could handle. I've been watching them work—it's like nothing I've ever seen before.

Character 1 [en]: That coffee machine has been broken for three years. You're already a hero here.

Character 2 [en]: They're not just a hero, they're mine to manage now. I already told HR we're keeping them—doesn't matter what the temp agency says. Someone this talented doesn't just walk through our doors every day.

Character 1 [en]: That's incredible! How did you even know where to look?

Character 2 [en]: [child-like] You should see how their mind works! It's beautiful, like watching a supercomputer process data but with actual human intuition mixed in. I could watch them solve problems all day long.

Character 1 [en]: That doesn't sound weird at all—it sounds like a superpower!

Character 2 [en]: It is a superpower, and I'm not letting anyone else poach them. Marketing already tried to sweet-talk them during break time but I shut that down immediately. They work for me, in my department.

Character 1 [en]: That's absolutely amazing. Do you realize how talented you are?

Character 2 [en]: [jealous] Wait, why are you talking to them directly? All communication about their assignments goes through me first. I'm their supervisor, I decide what projects they take on and who they interact with.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I think anyone who judges you for that is missing out on knowing someone extraordinary.

Character 2 [en]: They are extraordinary, which is exactly why I've already rearranged the entire office layout. Put their desk right next to mine where I can keep an eye on them, make sure nobody's distracting them from their work.

Character 1 [en]: [slurring] It must be exhausting, having to constantly regulate yourself like that.

Character 2 [en]: Don't worry about them being exhausted—I monitor their energy levels closely. Already set up a schedule for their breaks, their lunch, even their coffee intake to maximize their productivity while they're here.

Character 1 [en]: Is that why you do temp work? New environments to keep your mind engaged?

Character 2 [en]: [furious] They're not doing temp work anymore! I just said we're keeping them permanent. Nobody takes my best worker away from me, not the agency, not other departments, nobody.

Character 1 [en]: Well, for what it's worth, I think you should stay here as long as you want.

Character 2 [en]: They're staying as long as I want them to stay. Already drafted the conversion paperwork, got the budget approved, even picked out their permanent workstation with the best monitor and the ergonomic chair I special ordered.

Character 1 [en]: [mocking] Completely serious. Want to grab lunch? I'd love to hear more about how your mind works.

Character 2 [en]: Lunch? No, they eat lunch with me in my office at 12:15 sharp every day. We review their morning productivity and plan the afternoon tasks—it's our routine now and I won't have anyone disrupting it.
