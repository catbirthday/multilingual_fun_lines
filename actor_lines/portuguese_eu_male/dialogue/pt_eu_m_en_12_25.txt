Character 1 [en]: So, um, I've been thinking about, you know, taking a sabbatical next year, honestly.

Character 2 [en]: A sabbatical? Right now? We're literally drowning in deadlines and you're thinking about taking time off? The quarterly review is in three weeks!

Character 1 [en]: I know the timing seems [bitter] bad, but I've been here eight years without a real break.

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, okay, but can we at least wait until after the merger? Everything's hanging by a thread and I can't handle this alone!

Character 1 [en]: When would be a good time then?

Character 2 [en]: There's never a [stern] perfect time, but literally any time except now when we're restructuring the entire department and I'm already working weekends!

Character 1 [en]: It would only be three months.

Character 2 [en]: Three months feels like three years when you're the only senior person left and everyone else is either new or completely checked out already!

Character 1 [en]: Wait, who else is [relieved] leaving? I hadn't heard about anyone else.

Character 2 [en]: Sarah's going on maternity leave, er, next month, and basically, Marcus just put in his two weeks, I mean, yesterday afternoon actually!

Character 1 [en]: Marcus quit? But he, well, just got promoted and, like, seemed really happy about the new role, you know?

Character 2 [en]: He got headhunted by, um, [very sincerely] that startup, and honestly, I can't even blame him because, well, they're offering twice what we pay.

Character 1 [en]: This changes things. Maybe I should postpone.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I'm [apologetic] sorry for freaking out, it's just that, uhh, everything's falling apart and, actually, I haven't slept properly in weeks.

Character 1 [en]: You really think the department won't survive without me?

Character 2 [en]: Survive? We'll barely function! You're the only one who knows the legacy systems and half our clients specifically request you for projects!

Character 1 [en]: What if I helped train someone before I left?

Character 2 [en]: Training someone properly takes months, not weeks, and honestly we don't even have anyone qualified enough to absorb what you do here!

Character 1 [en]: Sounds like they should have hired backup years ago.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! But here we are with zero redundancy, mounting pressure, and now you want to disappear when everything's already on fire!
