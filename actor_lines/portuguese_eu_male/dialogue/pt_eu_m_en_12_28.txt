Character 1 [en]: So, um, I heard you've been, [extremely happy], tracking those signals from, you know, the eastern sector for weeks now?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, well, every time I come here to practice, I mean, I pick up chatter on the scanner, and, honestly, the patterns are getting more predictable. It's like target practice but with intercepted communications instead of bullets.

Character 1 [en]: How accurate have your predictions been?

Character 2 [en]: About as good as my grouping at 50 yards - tight and consistent. I've correctly anticipated four of their last five movements, which has given our team significant tactical advantages.

Character 1 [en]: That's impressive work. What's your next target?

Character 2 [en]: There's a convoy scheduled for Thursday that they think is invisible to us. But their operational security is sloppy, and I've triangulated their likely route through three separate intercepts.

Character 1 [en]: Can you verify the intel independently?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, I've got satellite confirmation, and, er, two ground assets who've, basically, corroborated the timeline. The thing is, they're using outdated encryption that's easier to crack than this paper target.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I need to, [formal], inform command about, you know, this development immediately.

Character 2 [en]: Hold that thought - there's more. They've been rotating personnel every 72 hours, but the pattern suggests they're about to extend that window, which gives us an opportunity.

Character 1 [en]: An opportunity for what exactly?

Character 2 [en]: For insertion, I mean, if we time it right, um, during the shift change, there's, like, a twelve-minute gap in their surveillance coverage. It's basically our best shot at getting someone inside.

Character 1 [en]: That's, uh, incredibly risky, and, sort of, requires perfect execution, honestly.

Character 2 [en]: Risk is relative, and, well, I've run simulations based on, you know, their previous operations, er, showing an 82% success probability. Those are better odds than hitting the bullseye from here with iron sights.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, your confidence is, actually, either brilliant or, like, dangerously naive, I guess.

Character 2 [en]: With respect, sir, I've, [overly polite], spent six months analyzing, um, their every move, and, basically, I know their playbook better than they do. This isn't overconfidence; it's calculated certainty based on solid intelligence work.

Character 1 [en]: Fine. What resources do you need?

Character 2 [en]: Just two spotters and, honestly, a clean extraction route, which, well, I've already mapped using their own patrol schedules against them. It's almost too easy, like shooting at this range with a laser sight.

Character 1 [en]: I'll auth-authorize, [stuttering], the operation, but if this goes sideways...

Character 2 [en]: It won't go sideways because I've accounted for every variable, just like I account for wind and distance here at the range. Intelligence gathering is just marksmanship with data instead of bullets.
