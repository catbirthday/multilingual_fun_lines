Character 1 [en]: Um, I just started this new job and, honestly, I think I made a terrible first impression.

Character 2 [en]: Well, first impressions are usually right, you know, so if you bombed it, they probably already made up their minds about you. Actually, studies show people decide within seven seconds whether they like someone or not.

Character 1 [en]: That's er, not really [apologetic] what I was hoping to hear, basically.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah uh, truth hurts [sniffle] sometimes, I mean. Look, not everyone is cut out for every job—maybe this one just isn't your thing and you should start looking for something else before they fire you.

Character 1 [en]: They're not going to fire me. I just spilled coffee during the morning meeting.

Character 2 [en]: Oh so, spilling coffee in front of [friendly] everyone, that's kind of your opening move? Classic sign of someone who cracks under pressure—I've seen it a million times at my office.

Character 1 [en]: It was an accident. The table was wobbly.

Character 2 [en]: Sure, blame the table. Everyone always has an excuse when they mess up, but successful people take responsibility instead of pointing fingers at furniture.

Character 1 [en]: You're being really harsh about this.

Character 2 [en]: Harsh? I'm being [slurring] realistic here. If you can't handle a little honesty from a friend, how are you going to handle actual criticism from your boss when performance reviews come around?

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I just wanted someone to listen and be supportive?

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, support without honesty is just enabling, the thing is. Would you rather I lie to you and say everything's fine when clearly you're struggling with basic motor skills in professional settings?

Character 1 [en]: Basic motor skills? Seriously?

Character 2 [en]: I'm just saying, adults don't usually spill beverages at work. My five-year-old nephew has better coordination, and he's still learning to tie his shoes.

Character 1 [en]: This is exactly why I don't tell you things anymore.

Character 2 [en]: Right, because avoiding feedback is definitely the path to success. No wonder you're having trouble at work if this is how you handle constructive criticism.

Character 1 [en]: Anyway, I should go, uhh, I have things to do.

Character 2 [en]: Running away from conversations, ah, that's another pattern I've noticed with you, sort of just bailing when things get real, I guess.

Character 1 [en]: I'm not running away, I'm choosing not to engage with someone who's being intentionally hurtful.

Character 2 [en]: Right so, now I'm the bad guy for err, trying to help you see reality? It's just that you always do this—ask for advice then get mad when it's not what you want to hear.
