============================================================

Customer: So. I think my payment's stuck? Probably been pending for... three days now.
1. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull that up here and... can I get your, um, account number or the transaction reference?
Customer: Sure. Sort of. TXN-4429-BK. I mean, that's what it says.
2. Right right, so, um, I'm seeing TXN-4429-BK here and, uh, yeah it's been in pending status since, hmm, Tuesday morning at 9:47 AM and basically what happened is...
Customer: Let me guess. System error? Maybe technical difficulties?
3. Actually, um, it's caught in our, uh, verification queue, so basically the system flagged it for manual review because, um, the amount was over the threshold for instant processing.
Customer: Great. Perfect. I think that's... fantastic. Really.
4. I know, I know, it's, um, frustrating and like, honestly? I see this happen, uh, way too often with amounts over five hundred and, hmm, let me see if I can just...
Customer: Ummm, so can you, like, maybe unstick it? Or is that, uh, probably asking too much?
5. So, um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, submit an escalation ticket ESC-7901-MP right now and, er, normally they say forty-eight hours but, hmm, between you and me? If I mark it priority...
Customer: That's what. The last person said. Sort of exactly that.
6. Wait, you called before about this?
Customer: Um, yeah? Yesterday? They said, uh, "escalation ticket." Probably the same speech.
7. Okay okay, so, um, let me check the notes here and... oh. I see ticket ESC-7344-RD from yesterday but, uh, it wasn't... they didn't actually submit it correctly, it's just sitting in draft status which is...
Customer: Of course. It is. Why would it be submitted.
8. Listen, I'm, um, really sorry about this, like genuinely, this shouldn't... okay so, uh, I'm submitting a new one, ESC-7905-MP, right now, and um, I'm also adding my direct extension 4412 to your account notes.
Customer: Uh-huh. And I should, what, probably believe this time?
9. So, um, I get why you're skeptical and, uh, honestly? Call me back at extension 4412 tomorrow if it's not resolved and I'll, um, personally walk it through to completion, like I'll literally stand over someone's shoulder if I have to.
Customer: Huh. Okay. That's... I think that's actually different. Maybe.
10. Yeah, and um, just so you know, I'm putting a reminder in my calendar for tomorrow at 2 PM to check on TXN-4429-BK myself, so like, even if you don't call, I'm, uh, gonna follow up on this because... three days is ridiculous.
Customer: Look, I I just need these brackets. Um, they're they're not here.
11. Oh, um, let me just—actually, hold on—I need to pull up your account first. Can you, uh, give me your order number or the account number for the practice?
Customer: It's it's ACC-4982. Dr. Chen's office.
12. Perfect, so I've got—um, wait, let me just—okay, account ACC-4982-DH, and I'm seeing here that, uh, your last shipment was marked delivered but you're saying the orthodontic brackets weren't included?
Customer: Um, yeah, exactly. We we only got half. Half!
13. That's—I mean, I'm really sorry about that, um, let me check the manifest here for shipment SHP-7263-XK and, uh, oh—actually I think I see—no wait, let me just verify this.
Customer: Can you just—I mean, um, the doctor's getting really really upset.
14. I completely understand, and, um, I wish I had better news but the system's showing that order ORD-9847-TM only had twenty units authorized, not the forty you're expecting.
Customer: No no no, that's wrong. We ordered forty. I I placed it myself.
15. Um, so here's what I can—er, actually, hmm, let me dig deeper because I see there's a modification flag on this order from last Tuesday.
Customer: Tuesday? Um, nobody changed anything Tuesday.
16. Right, so, uh, I'm looking at the audit log here and—um, oh, this is strange—transaction TXN-892764-B shows an inventory adjustment but, er, I can't access the full details from my level.
Customer: Your level? So so someone else could fix this?
17. Well, I mean, technically yes but, um, I'm only able to process replacements up to a certain dollar amount and, uh, these specialty brackets are outside my authorization limit.
Customer: I just—look, um, we have patients tomorrow. Kids kids with appointments.
18. Oh, that's—I really, really wish I could just override this but, um, the system won't let me process anything over the threshold and, er, these are flagged as controlled inventory under code INV-8827-SP.
Customer: Can I just, um, is there—could I talk to someone who who can?
19. Of course, um, I can definitely escalate this to a supervisor but, uh, I should mention the wait might be about fifteen to twenty minutes right now.
Customer: Fifteen—okay okay, um, I'll wait. I have to. The kids, they they need these.
20. Absolutely, and, er, while I'm placing you in the queue for supervisor assistance, um, I'm adding priority flag PRF-7264 to your case so they'll have all the context about the missing brackets and tomorrow's appointments.
Customer: Um, hey! So. Uh. Quick thing. These charges? They're... hmm, what's the word... sketchy?
21. Oh yeah, I totally get why that would be confusing—let me pull up your account real quick, I just need to verify with your account number or the last four digits of the card you're seeing the charges on?
Customer: Right. Um. Let me see here... uh, it's 4492. But like, okay so, um, the thing is—
22. Perfect, um, so I'm seeing account ending in 4492 and, uh, actually yeah this happens all the time and it's honestly kind of ridiculous how our parent company does this—what name are you, um, seeing on your statement?
Customer: Tech. Solutions. Global. Never heard of 'em!
23. Oh god, yeah, so, um, that's actually us but like—I know, I know, it's so dumb—we're owned by this, uh, bigger company and they process everything under TSG-Global which shows up as, um, Tech Solutions Global on statements and honestly we get like fifty calls a day about this.
Customer: Wait. Um. Hang on. So that's... hmm... that's actually you guys? Uh, okay so that means... wild.
24. I know right? It's completely ridiculous, like why can't they just use our actual company name but apparently it's some sort of payment processing thing with merchant code MRC-7829-GL and I wish I could change it but...
Customer: No but, um, like, here's the thing. Uh. I actually thought I was... er... getting scammed! Called my bank!
25. Oh no, um, yeah that's—I mean we literally have a whole, uh, FAQ page about this because it happens so much and honestly if I could just, um, march upstairs and tell them to fix it I would but they're all the way in corporate and, uh, you know how that goes...
Customer: Ha! Yeah. Corporate. The worst.
26. Right? So, um, let me just, uh, make a note here in your account ALT-99284-K that we've explained this and, um, I can also send you an email confirmation that shows, like, the connection between our company name and Tech Solutions Global if that would help?
Customer: Um, yeah actually? That'd be... hmm, what if the bank needs it? Er, proof?
27. Oh absolutely, I'm actually going to send you our official merchant verification document DOC-8827-TSG right now—should hit your inbox in about two minutes—and honestly your bank sees this all the time from us so they'll probably just be like "oh yeah, them again."
Customer: Cool. Cool cool. Um. So uh, quick question though? Like... why now?
28. So, um, actually that's a great question—we just, uh, switched payment processors like three weeks ago, reference number REF-20241102-PP, and I think—no wait, I know—they didn't really, um, tell customers which is kind of...
Customer: Oh! Um. That's. Hm. Not great. Er, communication-wise.
29. Yeah it's, um, honestly pretty typical and I'm sorry about that, like we should have sent an email or something but, uh, between you and me the transition has been kind of a mess and ticket number TKT-3847-MESS if you ever need to reference this conversation but hopefully you won't need to...
Customer: Nah, um, you're good! This is, uh, actually kinda fun? Like. Er. Mystery solved!
30. Ha! I love that attitude—honestly you're being way cooler about this than most people, and hey your confirmation email with case number CSE-9982-RESOLVED should be there now, but seriously thank you for not yelling at me about something I literally cannot control!
Customer: Um, hi. I need to, uh, speak to someone about my... er... rejected claim.
31. Oh, um, yeah absolutely, let me just—actually wait—so I need to, uh, pull up your account first. Can I get your member ID? It should be, um, something like MEM followed by some numbers.
Customer: MEM-47829-JX. It's for prescription RX-2947.
32. Got it, so, um, MEM-47829-JX, and I'm seeing—oh yeah, uh, this is frustrating—your claim CLM-9058274 got rejected for, er, "prior authorization required" which is honestly, like, the worst rejection code.
Customer: Yes. I, um, I know what that means. I'm a, uh... what's the word... pharmacy tech. I process these daily.
33. Oh man, you get it then—this system is absolutely ridiculous sometimes. So you already know we need form PA-7741 submitted by your prescriber, and honestly between you and me? Even when they send it, half the time it gets lost in processing.
Customer: That's the thing. I, er, submitted it myself. Three times. Um, through the portal.
34. Wait, you—okay so, um, let me check the, uh, submission history here... I'm seeing, hmm, three attempts under reference numbers REF-8827-A, REF-8829-B, and, um, REF-8832-C, all marked as "incomplete submission" which is—I mean, that's bizarre.
Customer: Incomplete. Of course. Every field was filled.
35. Yeah no, I believe you, this happens—so like, um, the system has these, uh, hidden requirements that even we don't always know about? Your submission ID SUB-47289-QM shows all fields complete but, er, apparently there's some backend flag that's not... hmm.
Customer: I can't, um, I deal with this garbage daily and, uh, when it's my own claim I just—sorry, it's like, you know what's wrong but can't fix it?
36. Trust me, I completely get it—it's like being a mechanic with a broken car you can't touch. Look, here's what I'm gonna do—I see claim CLM-9058274 is for medication that's, let me check, time-sensitive, right?
Customer: Yes. Very. I need it by Thursday.
37. Okay so, um, technically I'm not supposed to but, uh, I'm gonna escalate this directly to, er, our override team with priority code PRI-5589-URGENT, and like, they can push it through manually.
Customer: You can do that? I've never seen that option.
38. Well it's—so I have to—actually let me just—yeah, um, it's not in the regular system, it's a, uh, backdoor thing we use for cases like yours where the system's clearly, um, being stupid. Reference ticket TKT-20584-XP.
Customer: Thank god. Someone who actually gets how broken this is.
39. Listen, working here, I see how awful our system treats people who actually know what they're doing. Your authorization AUTH-9584-KLM should process within 24 hours now, and honestly? Save my direct extension—4782—for next time this happens.
Customer: I will. Thank you. Seriously.
40. No problem—and hey, your confirmation number is CNF-85947-TRX for tracking. Between us healthcare workers, we gotta stick together against these broken systems, right?
Customer: I just—no wait—I need to, um, stop getting all these, uh, emails.
41. Right right, so basically I can, um, absolutely help you with that, and uh, let me just pull up your account here real quick, so what I'll need is, er, your email address that's been getting these messages?
Customer: Um, it's—wait let me—john dot harris at, uh, gmail.
42. Got it.
Customer: Every morning. Six emails. I'm just... done.
43. Yeah no I, um, I totally get that, so I'm looking at your profile JH-4492-EMAIL and, uh, wow you're subscribed to basically everything we've got, so let me just, er, start removing these, and like, I wish our system made this easier for you guys.
Customer: Can we just—I want—actually, um, can you just kill all of it?
44. Absolutely, so what I'm doing is, um, going through each category here, there's like promotions, newsletters, partner offers, and uh, your preference ID is PREF-8827-QX, so basically I'm just gonna, er, uncheck everything right now.
Customer: Um, wait, how many—no actually—how many lists am I even on?
45. Okay okay.
Customer: That bad?
46. So you're on, ummm, let me count here, so there's twelve main lists, and then, uh, about eight partner lists, which is, er, honestly ridiculous, and like I'm really sorry about this, your marketing profile MKT-3341-DL shows you've been opted in since, um, 2019.
Customer: Funny thing is, um, I actually—wait—I like you guys. Just not, uh, this much.
47. Right, so basically what happens is, um, our system just keeps adding you to new campaigns and, er, I'm looking at your suppression code now, SUP-7765-MK, and uh, I'm making sure this is permanent, so you won't get re-added later.
Customer: Good. Quick question—no wait—will this, um, affect my account?
48. So no, um, not at all, your account stays totally active, and uh, this just stops the marketing stuff, so basically your account number ACC-9912-TRX remains the same, um, you can still order, check orders, everything like that.
Customer: Perfect. Um, honestly? You're making this, uh, pretty painless.
49. Well so, um, I'm just about done here, and er, you should get a confirmation email to that gmail address with reference number CNF-4456-XP9, and uh, after that, like, you're free from our marketing department forever basically.
Customer: Ha. Forever. I'll take it. Thanks—wait—um, seriously, thanks.
50. Yeah so, um, you're all set, and like, I'm sorry you had to call for this, it should just be, er, one button on the website, but anyway your opt-out is confirmed, tracking number OPT-2234-FINAL, and uh, you have a good rest of your day.
Character 1: The bill is forty-seven [rapidamente] eighty-three. What's twenty percent?
51. Jesus Christ, you serious? Move the decimal, double it—nine-fifty-six. Any third-grader with half a brain cell could figure that out without making it a whole production.
Character 1: Nine fifty-six? That's, um, way too much for chicken that tasted like, you know, cardboard.
52. Cardboard? You ordered the safest thing on the menu because you're terrified of flavor. Sarah didn't judge your boring-ass palate, so pay the woman her twenty percent.
Character 1: She forgot my salad, er, entirely until I had to, like, wave her down twice!
53. Oh boo-fucking-hoo, she forgot your, hmm, three leaves of iceberg lettuce. Meanwhile she's juggling twelve tables because, actually, management fired half the staff last week—I mean, cut her some slack.
Character 1: Fifteen percent then? That's, well, about seven dollars which seems, you know, more reasonable for the, uh, actual service we got?
54. Seven dollars? Are you, like, fucking kidding me right now? She spent two hours pretending your stupid jokes were funny—honestly, that alone deserves hazard pay, so, twenty percent minimum.
Character 1: Fine! But I'm not, err, tipping on the wine that was already, basically, marked up three hundred percent.
55. The wine you insisted on ordering to impress your date who left after the appetizer? Yeah, you tip on that humiliation tax too, buddy.
Character 1: Twenty-three dollars for house wine is [encantado] highway robbery!
56. Highway robbery is you thinking, umm, anyone gives a shit about your, actually, cheap-ass complaints when Sarah's trying to pay rent on two-thirteen an hour plus whatever scraps people like you leave.
Character 1: What if we just leave ten bucks?
57. Ten bucks works—congratulations, you just spent five minutes bitching your way to exactly what I said in the first place. Real smooth negotiation skills there, champ.
Character 1: Wait... you just, like, rounded up the bill! It's forty-seven dollars, so, er, ten is actually more than twenty percent!
58. No shit, Sherlock—servers tip out on total sales including, well, tax, which means they're paying the busboy and bartender whether you, honestly, tip properly or not, so yeah, we round up.
Character 1: This is [apaixonadamente] why I hate, you know, going out with you—everything becomes this, um, whole moral crusade!
59. Moral crusade? I'm just, basically, trying to make sure our server can, hmm, afford groceries while you're crying over two extra dollars like it's your kidney.
Character 1: Fine! Ten dollars—but, actually, you're paying for parking since you're so, well, goddamn generous with my money.
60. Your money? You still owe me forty from last week's bar tab, but sure—I'll cover parking while you, err, pretend you're not the cheapest bastard I know, honestly.
Character 1: So you're the guy who caught [exausto] the bouquet at my sister's wedding last year.
61. Wait, that was your sister's wedding? Small world—I still have that bouquet pressed in a book somewhere, which sounds way creepier than I meant it to. I'm Marcus, by the way.
Character 1: You kept it? That's [tosse] actually kind of sweet. I'm Riley.
62. Nice to meet you, Riley. So are you participating in this medieval torture ritual they call a garter toss, or are you just here for moral support?
Character 1: Oh god, I'm in it. My cousin made all the single guys promise.
63. Well, the thing is, I'm [alto] supposed to be catching this thing too, you know, because apparently my aunt thinks, um, twenty-eight is basically ancient for a bachelor. She literally pushed me onto the dance floor just now.
Character 1: Twenty-eight? Try thirty-two. My mom introduced me to three different women during cocktail hour.
64. Three? That's, uh, impressive efficiency on her part. My record is five at my cousin's bar mitzvah, but, I mean, that was a six-hour event so she had more time to work with.
Character 1: Did you, like, actually date any of them? I'm, err, curious because my success rate with these setups is, honestly, zero.
65. Oh absolutely not—one was, hmm, my dentist's daughter who spent twenty minutes describing her cat's anxiety medication, and another one, well, turned out to be my ex's new roommate. The universe has a twisted sense of humor sometimes.
Character 1: That's brutal. Though not as bad as the time my dad set me up with his accountant's daughter at Thanksgiving.
66. Thanksgiving setup? That's advanced level parent meddling right there. At least at weddings you can escape to the bar—at Thanksgiving you're trapped until the pie comes out.
Character 1: She brought a PowerPoint about, um, her five-year plan. It had, you know, animated transitions and, actually, a timeline for kids.
67. A PowerPoint presentation at Thanksgiving dinner? That's simultaneously the most terrifying and impressive thing I've ever heard. Did she at least have good slide design?
Character 1: The fonts were, I guess, [formal] professionally chosen and, well, the color scheme was actually quite pleasant.
68. You know what, I respect the commitment to branding. If you're going to scare someone off, might as well do it with style and proper kerning.
Character 1: Oh shit, they're starting. DJ just called all the single guys.
69. Here we go—time to, basically, pretend we want to catch a piece of lace while, you know, twenty drunk relatives cheer like it's the damn Super Bowl.
Character 1: Want to make a pact? Whoever catches it, um, [amigável] buys the other a drink to, sort of, commiserate about this whole ridiculous tradition?
70. Deal—though fair warning, I have surprisingly good reflexes when alcohol and peer pressure are involved. My catching-random-wedding-objects record is currently two and zero.
Character 1: Um, I just started this new job and, honestly, I think I made a terrible first impression.
71. Well, first impressions are usually right, you know, so if you bombed it, they probably already made up their minds about you. Actually, studies show people decide within seven seconds whether they like someone or not.
Character 1: That's er, not really [apologético] what I was hoping to hear, basically.
72. Yeah uh, truth hurts [fungando] sometimes, I mean. Look, not everyone is cut out for every job—maybe this one just isn't your thing and you should start looking for something else before they fire you.
Character 1: They're not going to fire me. I just spilled coffee during the morning meeting.
73. Oh so, spilling coffee in front of [amigável] everyone, that's kind of your opening move? Classic sign of someone who cracks under pressure—I've seen it a million times at my office.
Character 1: It was an accident. The table was wobbly.
74. Sure, blame the table. Everyone always has an excuse when they mess up, but successful people take responsibility instead of pointing fingers at furniture.
Character 1: You're being really harsh about this.
75. Harsh? I'm being [slurring] realistic here. If you can't handle a little honesty from a friend, how are you going to handle actual criticism from your boss when performance reviews come around?
Character 1: Maybe I just wanted someone to listen and be supportive?
76. Hmm, support without honesty is just enabling, the thing is. Would you rather I lie to you and say everything's fine when clearly you're struggling with basic motor skills in professional settings?
Character 1: Basic motor skills? Seriously?
77. I'm just saying, adults don't usually spill beverages at work. My five-year-old nephew has better coordination, and he's still learning to tie his shoes.
Character 1: This is exactly why I don't tell you things anymore.
78. Right, because avoiding feedback is definitely the path to success. No wonder you're having trouble at work if this is how you handle constructive criticism.
Character 1: Anyway, I should go, uhh, I have things to do.
79. Running away from conversations, ah, that's another pattern I've noticed with you, sort of just bailing when things get real, I guess.
Character 1: I'm not running away, I'm choosing not to engage with someone who's being intentionally hurtful.
80. Right so, now I'm the bad guy for err, trying to help you see reality? It's just that you always do this—ask for advice then get mad when it's not what you want to hear.
Character 1: Oh wow, um, this is [muito animado] amazing, you know, I've never seen a mind reading act, er, up close like this before!
81. Welcome to the mystical corner of our festival! I'm about to demonstrate something [pausa longa] extraordinary with numbers, but first, let me ask you to think of any number between one and a thousand.
Character 1: Okay so, I'm thinking of one, uh, but like, how could you possibly know what it is?
82. Ah, the skepticism is natural, you know, but here's the thing, numbers have vibrations, actually, that most people can't perceive. Your number is... three hundred and forty-seven, and you chose it because it has personal significance, perhaps a date?
Character 1: That's... that's exactly right! How did you do that?
83. Trade secret, my friend, but anyway, let me show you something else, er, even more fascinating, honestly. Pick a card from this deck, memorize it, and I'll tell you not just the card but the number you're visualizing on it.
Character 1: Well, I've got it, um, but I mean, there's no way you could, actually, see what I'm thinking.
84. Seven of hearts, and hmm, you're imagining the number seven glowing, sort of, in gold, right? That's because, well, your mind associates that number with luck or maybe a birthday in July?
Character 1: This is, uh, completely impossible, but like, you're getting everything right, so, how are you doing this?
85. Years of practice reading micro-expressions, body language, [aliviado] and honestly, a bit of showmanship never hurts, you know? But here's where it gets really interesting - I want you to write down any four-digit number on this paper without showing me.
Character 1: Alright, I wrote it down. Now what?
86. Fold it up, hold it tight, and basically, I'm going to attempt something, er, I rarely do in public, okay so, just concentrate on those digits. Two... nine... four... eight. Your birth year perhaps?
Character 1: I can't, um, even process this, like, are you actually psychic or, I mean, is this some kind of trick?
87. The beautiful thing about illusion is that it lives in the space between reality and impossibility. Now, for my finale, I need you to multiply your age by two, add five, then multiply by fifty.
Character 1: Okay, uh, I did the math, and actually, I got, well, a pretty big number here.
88. One thousand seven hundred and fifty, which means you're thirty years old, born in nineteen ninety-four, which connects beautifully to that number you wrote earlier, doesn't it?
Character 1: You just, like, [entusiasmado] blew my mind completely, and honestly, I don't know whether to, um, applaud or run away!
89. Most people have that reaction, but here's the thing, err, the real magic isn't in the tricks themselves, you know, it's in reminding people that the world is full of wonder. Would you like to learn one simple number trick to amaze your friends?
Character 1: Yes, absolutely! Teach me something!
90. Perfect! Take any three-digit number, reverse it, subtract the smaller from the larger, and the answer will always be divisible by ninety-nine - mathematics disguised as magic, but don't tell anyone that secret.
Character 1: So, um, I've been thinking about, you know, taking a sabbatical next year, honestly.
91. A sabbatical? Right now? We're literally drowning in deadlines and you're thinking about taking time off? The quarterly review is in three weeks!
Character 1: I know the timing seems [amargo] bad, but I've been here eight years without a real break.
92. Oh god, okay, but can we at least wait until after the merger? Everything's hanging by a thread and I can't handle this alone!
Character 1: When would be a good time then?
93. There's never a [severo] perfect time, but literally any time except now when we're restructuring the entire department and I'm already working weekends!
Character 1: It would only be three months.
94. Three months feels like three years when you're the only senior person left and everyone else is either new or completely checked out already!
Character 1: Wait, who else is [aliviado] leaving? I hadn't heard about anyone else.
95. Sarah's going on maternity leave, er, next month, and basically, Marcus just put in his two weeks, I mean, yesterday afternoon actually!
Character 1: Marcus quit? But he, well, just got promoted and, like, seemed really happy about the new role, you know?
96. He got headhunted by, um, [muito sinceramente] that startup, and honestly, I can't even blame him because, well, they're offering twice what we pay.
Character 1: This changes things. Maybe I should postpone.
97. Look, I'm [apologético] sorry for freaking out, it's just that, uhh, everything's falling apart and, actually, I haven't slept properly in weeks.
Character 1: You really think the department won't survive without me?
98. Survive? We'll barely function! You're the only one who knows the legacy systems and half our clients specifically request you for projects!
Character 1: What if I helped train someone before I left?
99. Training someone properly takes months, not weeks, and honestly we don't even have anyone qualified enough to absorb what you do here!
Character 1: Sounds like they should have hired backup years ago.
100. Absolutely! But here we are with zero redundancy, mounting pressure, and now you want to disappear when everything's already on fire!
Character 1: [pausado] Well, I know this is, um, awkward after three years of not speaking, but I'm here because, [clinical], your pacemaker manufacturer is facing, [cuidadoso], serious liability issues and, uh, you could be entitled to significant compensation.
101. [amargo] So you finally show up when there's, [vazio], money involved, not when I had the surgery, not when I nearly, [trémulo], died from the complications, but now when you can, [frio], build a case.
Character 1: Um, Dad, I mean—
102. [exausto] Don't call me that like you, uh, suddenly remember who I am when for years you've treated me like, [sinking], just another name in your contact list that you, well, never quite get around to calling, like I'm some, [distante], unfinished task.
Character 1: [profissional] The device in your chest has a forty-three percent failure rate that the company, [estável], knew about but chose to hide from patients and doctors.
103. [cansado] I suppose you need me to, um, sign something, give a deposition about how this thing, [gesturing], has been ticking inside me like a bomb for, well, five years now.
Character 1: [conflicted] Look, I, um, I understand you're angry but this isn't just about, [struggling], the money—these people knowingly put thousands of lives at risk including, well, yours, and someone needs to, [firme], hold them accountable.
104. You always were good at, um, making everything sound noble when really you're just, [acusador], doing your job, collecting your thirty percent while the rest of us, well, live with the, [pesado], consequences.
Character 1: [defensivo] I'm trying to, um, help you here and, well, maybe fix something between us while, [mais baixo], there's still time.
105. [scoffs] Um, still time.
Character 1: Well, yeah, I mean—
106. [resignado] The doctors say this device could, um, fail any day now and when it does, I have maybe, [tremendo], ten minutes to get to a hospital before my heart, well, just stops. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [atónito] Jesus, I didn't, um, I mean, the case files didn't mention that the failure was, [voz embargando], that catastrophic or that, well, imminent.
107. [monótono] Well, now you know why I stopped, um, making plans beyond next week and why your mother's spare bedroom became, [pesado], my permanent address after I couldn't, like, live alone anymore.
Character 1: [culpado] Mom never, um, told me.
108. She said you had enough on your plate with your, [sardonic], important cases saving the world one lawsuit at a time.
Character 1: [suave] I could, um, get you moved up on the surgery list, I mean, I know the head of cardiology at Presbyterian and he owes me, [determinado], several favors from the stent litigation we won last year.
109. [cansado] After seventy-four years, my body's too weak for another surgery and honestly, well, I'm tired of being cut open, tired of, [fading], fighting, tired of waiting for my son to remember I exist beyond being a potential, um, plaintiff.
Character 1: [voz a quebrar] Dad, I'm sorry, I mean, I know I can't just show up here and fix everything with, well, legal documents and, um, settlement offers.
110. [baixinho] Just sit with me for a while, no papers, no, [gentil], depositions, just sit.
Customer: Hum, então basicamente preciso de... tipo, atualizar a minha morada? Outra vez? Esta é, ah, a quinta vez este ano.
111. Nossa. Hum, está bem então—deixa-me só—na verdade, hmm, cinco vezes? Isso é... Não. Vamos resolver isto. Número de conta?
Customer: É... como é que se diz... ridículo. Sou cliente há 6 anos.
112. 6 anos. Família militar? Estou a ver mudanças aqui. Fevereiro. Abril. Junho. Agosto. Agora outubro. A conta ACT-7783-PMQ mostra tudo.
Customer: Sim! E então tipo, sempre é a mesma... chatice? Formulários e, ah, espera e depois o meu correio simplesmente...
113. Não não não. Para. Isto é—espera, deixa-me só—hum, estou a abrir uma coisa. Código de perfil MIL-SPOUSE-92. Ah, isto devia ter sido sinalizado. Alguém falhou aqui.
Customer: Então basicamente o que acontece é, hum, eles dizem que está atualizado mas depois, ah, as encomendas vão para a antiga... se é que me faço entender, quer dizer...
114. Faz todo o sentido. Estou a ver o rastreamento. Três devoluções. Duas encomendas perdidas. Números de referência RTN-8847-X e RTN-8849-K. Isto acaba hoje.
Customer: Só preciso que as coisas funcionem. Uma vez. Só uma vez.
115. Está bem então, hum, é o seguinte que vou fazer. Preparado? Hum, protocolo de reencaminhamento permanente. Código PFP-ACTIVE-7. Basicamente, ah, alguma coisa corre mal? Reencaminha automaticamente. Sem formulários.
Customer: Espera, isso é... isso, hum, existe mesmo? Porque, eh pá, nunca mencionaram...
116. Porque a maioria dos agentes não sabe. Ou não quer saber. Anulação para Cônjuge Militar. MSO-77429-Q acabei de ativar. Mudas-te? Uma chamada. 5 minutos. Feito.
Customer: Isso seria... nem consigo...
117. E, hum, ouve—também vou, ah, adicionar estatuto prioritário? Tipo, as tuas coisas são enviadas primeiro. Sempre. Confirmação PSC-9847-GOLD. Isso é, hum, normalmente para contas empresariais mas...
Customer: Hum, uau, isto é, ah, tão diferente de... quer dizer, normalmente só dizem desculpe e...
118. Qual é a tua morada nova? Completa. Vou garantir que isto fica perfeito.
Customer: Se isto realmente funcionar da próxima vez...
119. Vai funcionar. Hum, e aqui está a minha linha direta. Tipo, a minha secretária mesmo. 555-0147 extensão 291. Chamo-me Marcus. Mudas-te outra vez? Liga-me. Não para o número geral. Para mim.
Customer: Obrigado. A sério. Mas se falhar outra vez...
120. Não vai. As famílias militares já lidam com o suficiente. Email de confirmação enviado. Lote de atualização de encomenda UPD-5547-COMPLETE a processar agora. Deves ver as mudanças em 10 minutos. Verifica a tua caixa de entrada.
Customer: Um, hello. Yes. So grateful you picked up. I have a... what's the word... reimbursement issue.
121. Oh hi there! Um, yes absolutely, I'm—I'm really happy to help you with that today! So let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, hmm, I'll need to get your member number first, it should be something like MEM-followed by, um, six digits?
Customer: MEM-four-seven-two. Nine-one-eight. I'm with the, uh, Natural History Museum. Docent program.
122. Perfect, perfect! So I've got you here, MEM-472918, and um, I can see you're, uh, part of our institutional accounts which is—that's great actually because, hmm, we have some special procedures for museum staff, so let me just, er, check what's going on with your reimbursement here...
Customer: Thank you. So kind. Um, it's about the, uh, the March workshop expenses. From Phoenix.
123. Okay so—wait let me—actually I think I see it here, um, there's a pending reimbursement request REQ-3847-AZ from, uh, March fifteenth through eighteenth? And it's showing, hmm, it's sort of stuck in processing, which is, er, probably why you're calling, right?
Customer: Stuck. Yes. Been two months now. Getting a bit... concerned about the delay and...
124. Right right, totally understand that concern! So um, what I'm seeing here is—oh this is, uh, kind of interesting actually—your submission has all the receipts but, er, there's a flag on transaction TXN-558291-Q that says, hmm, "requires secondary approval for amounts over threshold" which I think means, um, someone needs to manually review it?
Customer: Um, but wait, over threshold? Each receipt was under. Under fifty. I checked specifically because...
125. Oh! Oh okay so—hmm let me—actually you're right, I'm looking at the individual amounts and, uh, they're all under fifty but I think maybe the, er, system added them together? So the total of, um, let me calculate... two hundred thirty-seven dollars might've triggered our, uh, our bulk review process?
Customer: That's... oh dear. Um, nobody mentioned combining would... uh, this is getting complicated now and I...
126. No no no, we're—we're definitely going to fix this, don't worry! Um, so what I can do right now is, uh, I can manually override that flag because, hmm, I can see in your notes that you're, er, you're approved for workshop reimbursements up to three hundred per quarter under agreement AGR-7792-MUS, so this shouldn't have been held up at all!
Customer: Oh thank goodness. Really? You can just... fix it from there? That's wonderful. So helpful.
127. Absolutely!
Customer: Um, and the, er, the parking receipts? Those were separate. Did those also get...?
128. So let me—hmm, okay so I see, uh, three parking receipts here under reference PRK-4408-A through C, and um, those are actually—oh interesting—they're already approved and, er, it looks like they were processed last week? So you should probably be getting that reimbursement of, uh, forty-two dollars separately?
Customer: Last week? But I haven't... um, oh no, which account did they... not my old one?
129. Oh! Um, let me check—so it's going to, uh, hmm, the account ending in... 4-7-7-9? Is that—wait, actually let me double-check because sometimes our system, er, defaults to the original account on file and maybe that's not the right one anymore?
Customer: Four-seven-seven-nine. Closed that. Years ago. This is... uh, getting worse. Everything's scattered now...
130. Okay okay, no—we're going to sort this all out right now, I promise! So um, first thing, I'm putting a stop on that payment STP-9903-X so it doesn't go to the closed account, and then, uh, I'm going to update everything to your current account which I assume is, hmm, different? And then we'll reprocess both the workshop expenses and, er, the parking together, probably get you the full two-seventy-nine in, like, three to five business days, okay?
Customer: Hum, pois, então eu tenho um crédito que, ah, de alguma forma foi aplicado na conta errada. Claro.
131. Oh não, hum, está bem então deixa-me só, ah, ver aqui a tua informação e—hmm, então basicamente o que acontece às vezes é tipo, o sistema pode, hum, encaminhar mal os créditos se houver múltiplas contas e... deixa-me ver com o que estamos a lidar, qual é o teu número de conta?
Customer: É 4482-9901. Devia ser um crédito de cem euros.
132. Certo certo, então hum, estou a ver a conta 4482-9901 aqui e, ah, deixa-me só verificar o histórico de transações—então basicamente há um crédito que foi para, hmm, espera isto é interessante, foi para a conta 4482-9902 em vez disso, hum, ID de transação TXN-847291-MK, e isso é tipo, obviamente não é a tua conta por isso...
Customer: Hum, pois, essa, ah, não é minha. É, porque é que faria sequer isso?
133. Então infelizmente o que aconteceu aqui—e eu gostava mesmo de ter uma explicação melhor—mas às vezes quando as contas têm números parecidos o sistema automatizado comete estes erros de encaminhamento, especialmente com créditos processados através do ficheiro batch BTC-2847-X, e consigo ver que isto foi processado terça-feira passada...
Customer: Ah, ótimo. Então, hum, podes só, é, movê-lo ou...?
134. Ok então, hum, aqui está a questão—e eu estou, ah, mesmo arrependido desta limitação—mas tipo, quando um crédito é lançado numa conta, mesmo que seja a errada, eu não consigo simplesmente, hum, transferi-lo diretamente, o que é super frustrante porque consigo literalmente vê-lo aqui mesmo, número de referência REF-55821-QP, mas o sistema não me deixa simplesmente, ah, movê-lo...
Customer: Claro que não deixa. Nada é simples.
135. Eu sei, eu sei, é—hum, mas pronto, então o que EU POSSO fazer, ah, e isto é tipo a solução alternativa que usamos—posso submeter um pedido de correção, formulário CRQ-7756, e hum, basicamente isso sinaliza para a equipa de back office que pode, ah, reverter o crédito e reaplicá-lo, percebes?
Customer: Hum, quanto tempo é que isso, ah, normalmente demora? Porque, é, eu preciso disto.
136. Então o tempo de processamento standard para o pedido de correção CRQ-7756 é três a cinco dias úteis, mas—e aqui é onde posso realmente ajudar—se eu marcar como código de escalamento prioritário ESC-P1, deve processar dentro de vinte e quatro a quarenta e oito horas em vez disso.
Customer: É, isso é... hum, na verdade melhor do que eu esperava. Ah, consegues fazer isso?
137. Claro que sim! Deixa-me já tratar disso—estou a introduzir o código de prioridade ESC-P1, a associá-lo à tua transação original TXN-847291-MK, e a adicionar notas detalhadas sobre o encaminhamento errado para que o back office saiba exatamente o que aconteceu e para onde o crédito tem de ir.
Customer: Ok. Pois. Isso ajudaria.
138. Pronto, então hum, estou a submeter isto agora e—oh bom, passou, então o teu número de caso é, ah, CSE-94482-AA, e hum, deves receber um email de confirmação em tipo, hmm, uns dez minutos mais ou menos com todos os detalhes...
Customer: Vai, é, mostrar-me mesmo quando estiver resolvido?
139. Sim! Então vais receber uma confirmação inicial com o número de caso CSE-94482-AA, depois outro email quando começarem a processar, e um final quando o crédito for lançado na tua conta correta—cada email terá o estado atual e o tempo estimado de conclusão.
Customer: Hum, está bem. Isso é... isso é bastante completo na verdade.
140. Pois então, hum, também adicionei uma nota à tua conta com a referência REF-CREDIT-FIX por isso se precisares de ligar de volta, ah, qualquer agente consegue ver exatamente o que fizemos hoje, e tipo, vão ter todos os números de caso e tudo, por isso... há mais alguma coisa em que possa ajudar já que estamos aqui?
Customer: Pronto então estou—estou a ligar por causa do meu recibo. Para o trabalho. O serviço de parques precisa dele até, hum, até sexta-feira.
141. Certo certo, pois então hum, deixe-me só abrir isso—isso aqui rapidamente e, ah, percebo perfeitamente esses prazos do trabalho são—são absolutamente ridículos às vezes sinceramente. Qual é o, hum, qual é o seu número de encomenda ou conta?
Customer: É hum... deixa-me ver aqui... RNG-4521. Conta com desconto de guarda-florestal.
142. Ok perfeito então, ah, tenho aqui a conta RNG-4521-PKS e estou a ver—oh bem pois há tipo, hum, três encomendas diferentes do mês passado que não têm—desculpe, quer dizer faltam os recibos detalhados o que é, ah, super irritante eu sei porque o nosso sistema devia automaticamente... enfim deixe-me arranjar isto.
Customer: Três? Não não não, deviam ser—deviam ser quatro. Compras de outubro.
143. Oh tem—tem toda a razão na verdade, hum, há mais uma escondida na transação TXN-891265-OCT que não estava—não estava ligada corretamente o que sinceramente acontece demasiadas vezes com as nossas, ah, nossas encomendas em volume é um bocado embaraçoso mas, hum, deixe-me só juntar isto tudo rapidamente.
Customer: Hmm, ok então isso significa... espera, consegues pôr tudo num PDF?
144. Sim sim completamente, então hum, vou—vou juntar tudo no documento DOC-7739-COMB e, ah, sinceramente cá entre nós? A nossa equipa de contabilidade complica isto muito mais do que devia mas, hum, posso adicionar todos os códigos de isenção fiscal e—e a informação de faturação do departamento que precisas.
Customer: Bom bom bom. Hum, porque da última vez? Rejeitaram-no. Custou-me 200 euros.
145. Oh não pode ser, isso é—isso é completamente inaceitável, hum, deixa-me garantir que este fica à prova de bala então, ah, vou adicionar o código de verificação VER-3982-EXEMPT e vou pôr, hum, pôr a autorização do teu departamento mesmo—mesmo no topo onde não podem deixar de ver desta vez.
Customer: Sabes quantos—quantos obstáculos temos de ultrapassar? Para equipamento básico?
146. Completamente. Não quer dizer, ah, eu trabalhava com—com contas governamentais e é simplesmente... a papelada é uma loucura sinceramente. O teu número de confirmação vai ser CNF-4455-URGENT e estou, hum, estou a marcar como prioritário para ultrapassar o habitual, ah, o disparate habitual dos três dias de processamento.
Customer: Como é que se diz... expedito? É isso?
147. Certo certo. Expedito.
Customer: Hmm, e tens a certeza—certeza que isto vai funcionar? Não posso ter outra... situação.
148. Sim então, hum, estou mesmo a verificar—verificar duas vezes aqui e o teu lote de recibos RBT-9901-COMPLETE tem, ah, tudo o que possam vir a pedir tipo detalhamento, NIF, ordens de compra, o—o pacote completo basicamente e sinceramente se rejeitarem este eu, hum, eu escalava porque este está perfeito agora.
Customer: Deixa-me ver aqui... email para jones arroba... ok percebi percebi.
149. Perfeito e, ah, só para saberes o número de referência REF-6672-RANGER está—está anexado a tudo por isso se alguém te chatear só, hum, só citas isso e vão ver que basicamente sinalizei isto como, ah, como pré-aprovado para reembolso o que tecnicamente não devia fazer mas...
Customer: Para a próxima? Se isto acontecer? Vou ligar ao teu—teu supervisor. Nível de diretor.
150. Não não totalmente justo, hum, sinceramente eu—eu faria o mesmo e entre nós? Às vezes é a única forma de conseguir que as coisas, ah, sejam mesmo resolvidas por aqui mas os teus documentos estão—estão a enviar agora para jones arroba parks ponto gov com cópia de segurança BCK-2234-FILE por isso estás—estás pronto e, hum, devem aprovar sem problema desta vez.
Customer: Olá, hum, provavelmente estou a complicar isto mais do que devia, mas tenho um problema de faturação com os meus créditos de formação contínua e eu só...
151. Hum, está bem então, ah, deixa-me só—não espera—deixa-me abrir o, hum, portal de formação contínua aqui e, ah, basicamente posso ajudar-te com isso, então qual é o teu número de conta ou, hum, email?
Customer: É sarah.martinez arroba therapyworks ponto com, e sinto-me tão estúpido porque provavelmente cliquei em algo errado quando estava a inscrever-me no workshop de disfagia no mês passado...
152. Certo, certo.
Customer: O pagamento foi processado duas vezes, o que é totalmente culpa minha de certeza, estava com pressa entre sessões e a página de pagamento estava... como é que se diz... a carregar talvez?
153. Então, hum, estou a ver aqui—ah, espera, deixa-me só—ok então basicamente a tua conta SMT-4429-CE mostra, hum, duas cobranças idênticas de 189€ cada no dia 12 de outubro, e ah, isso não é, tipo, culpa tua de todo.
Customer: Ah mesmo? Porque eu continuei a clicar em submeter quando nada acontecia e pensei que talvez eu...
154. Hum, não não, então tipo, isto acontece, ah, constantemente na verdade com o nosso, hum—o processador de pagamentos que usamos às vezes, er, duplica cobranças quando há, ah, problemas de latência, então basicamente posso processar o reembolso RFD-9281-X agora mesmo.
Customer: Isso seria fantástico, quer dizer se não for muito incómodo, sei que deves estar cheio de trabalho e devia ter ligado mais cedo mas...
155. São dois segundos.
Customer: Hum, então tipo, quanto tempo é que normalmente, ah, demora para o reembolso, hum, aparecer? Desculpa, sei que é provavelmente uma pergunta parva...
156. Não é parva. Três a cinco dias.
Customer: Ah ótimo, isso é mesmo perfeito porque preciso de me inscrever no de distúrbios alimentares pediátricos e estava preocupado com ter cobranças duplas no meu cartão de trabalho se isso faz...
157. Então, hum, na verdade—er, deixa-me só—posso, ah, aplicar o código de crédito CRD-1847-PF à tua conta agora mesmo então, hum, basicamente poderias inscrever-te hoje sem, tipo, esperar pelo reembolso se quiseres?
Customer: A sério? Oh isso é... quer dizer, tens a certeza que não há problema?
158. Hum, sim então, ah, ando a fazer isto há, er, seis anos e basicamente, hum, com profissionais de saúde tentamos, tipo, agilizar as coisas porque, ah, sabes, prazos de formação contínua e isso tudo—já processei aliás.
Customer: Estás literalmente a salvar o meu prazo de certificação, não acredito que quase deixei isto estragar o meu... como é que lhe chamam... o meu ciclo de renovação porque estava demasiado envergonhado para ligar.
159. Acontece constantemente.
Customer: Então uso apenas esse código de crédito quando me inscrever? Desculpa, quero ter a certeza que não volto a estragar isto de alguma forma...
160. Hum, então tipo, já está, ah, aplicado à tua conta então quando, er, finalizares a compra vai, hum, automaticamente deduzir o crédito de 189€—e ah, vais receber o email de confirmação CNF-6720-B em, tipo, cinco minutos basicamente.
Customer: Um, yeah, so I'm—wait, hold on—estou a ligar sobre o meu, uh, o meu cheque?
161. Oh absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Deixa-me só abrir a sua conta aqui, e vou precisar de verificar umas informações primeiro, posso ter o seu número de ID de funcionário por favor?
Customer: It's, um... 6-2—não espera, isso é... desculpa. 6-3-1-4.
162. Perfect, um, let me just... como é que se diz... navegar para a secção de salários aqui, e uh, estou a ver ID de funcionário 6314, e um, podes confirmar o teu apelido para mim?
Customer: Chen. C-H-E-N.
163. Great, so um, Mr. Chen, tenho o teu perfil aqui com código de funcionário EMP-6314-KC e uh, disseste que há um problema com o teu salário, então tipo, o que é que parece estar mal especificamente?
Customer: Yeah, um, it's just... uh, as horas estão erradas, acho eu? Ou tipo, as horas extra não estão...
164. Okay okay, so let me check your recent pay stub, número de referência PAY-112024-6314, e consigo ver as tuas horas base registadas em 40, mas fala-me das horas extra que mencionaste?
Customer: I did, um, 53 hours last week. Não—espera, não é isso—54. Definitivamente 54.
165. Alright so, um, 54 total hours, o que seria, uh, deixa-me só... isso são 14 horas de horas extra, e um, olhando para a folha de horas TS-6314-W46, só estou a ver 48 horas registadas, então isso é definitivamente uma discrepância que precisamos de corrigir.
Customer: Right. Yeah. Isso é... então tu consegues arranjar isso?
166. Oh absolutely, yes! Então um, o que eu vou fazer é, uh, preciso de criar o que se chama... hmm, qual é o termo... um pedido de ajuste de salário, e isso vai ser o ticket número ADJ-20241115-6314, e tipo, isto deve ser processado bastante rapidamente.
Customer: Um, okay but like, when though? Porque, uh, a renda é... tu sabes...
167. Right right, totally understand the urgency here, então o pedido de ajuste ADJ-20241115-6314 normalmente processa dentro de 2 a 3 dias úteis, e depois o pagamento corrigido chega à tua conta dentro de 24 horas após aprovação.
Customer: Two to—sorry, um, that's like, uh, isso pode ser terça? Ou quarta mesmo?
168. So, um, today's Thursday, o que significa, uh, se tudo correr bem—e deixa-me só—aliás, hmm, posso marcar isto como prioridade com o código PRI-HOUSING, e um, isso normalmente acelera as coisas para tipo, processamento no próximo dia útil?
Customer: Oh. Okay. Isso seria... isso funcionava.
169. Perfect! And um, just so you know, também vou, uh, enviar-te um email de confirmação com número de referência CNF-6314-111524, e tipo, isso vai ter todos os detalhes sobre o valor do ajuste e data esperada de depósito, o teu email registado ainda está atual?
Customer: Yeah it's, um, the gmail one. Ainda é esse. Um, obrigado por... por realmente ajudares com isto...
170. Of course! Então estás todo arranjado com o ticket de ajuste ADJ-20241115-6314 marcado como prioridade, e deves receber esse email de confirmação dentro da próxima hora, e honestamente se não vires o depósito até segunda, liga-nos definitivamente de volta e referencia esse número de ticket!
Customer: Hum, olá, eu... eu estou a ligar porque há esta disputa e eu não... quer dizer...
171. Está bem, hum, deixe-me abrir aqui a sua conta. Pode dar-me, ah, o número da conta ou o email associado ao processamento de pagamentos?
Customer: É, ah, está em ChefMarissa arroba... espera, devo dar-lhe o nome do cliente ou...?
172. Então, hum, qualquer um serve. Posso pesquisar por, é, como é que se diz... conta de comerciante ou nome de cliente. O que tiver mais à mão. Deixe-me só, ah, entrar aqui no sistema de disputas.
Customer: Thompson. Os Thompson fizeram... estão a dizer que eu não...
173. Entendido. Ok então estou a ver, hum, caso de disputa DSP-44729-RT aqui registado há três dias no valor de 4.200€. É isso, ah, é isso que estamos a ver?
Customer: Hum, sim, isso é... meu Deus, isso são duas semanas de trabalho e eu simplesmente...
174. Certo. Então, hum, vendo aqui as notas, eles alegam, é, serviços não prestados? Mas consigo ver que tem, ah, histórico de transações com cobranças semanais. Números de referência TXN-8847291 até TXN-8847296.
Customer: Eu cozinhei para eles! Todas as terças e quintas! Tenho recibos algures...
175. Ok, hum, isso é bom. Isso é mesmo, ah, muito bom. Então o que precisamos fazer é, é, compilar a sua documentação. Tem faturas, fotos das refeições, alguma coisa assim?
Customer: Fotos? Hum, quer dizer, eu tiro sempre fotos para o meu portfólio mas...
176. Perfeito. Então, ah, eis o que acontece. Vai carregar essas para o caso número DSP-44729-RT. Vou, hum, enviar-lhe um link. Deve ajudar bastante o seu caso.
Customer: Mas e se eles ainda... quer dizer, eles são ricos, têm advogados e...
177. Olhe, eu já, é, faço isto há algum tempo. A documentação ganha estes casos. Carregue tudo. Recibos, fotos, hum, quaisquer mensagens sobre as refeições. O sistema mostra confirmações de entrega na morada deles todas as semanas.
Customer: Hum, ok, então eu só... carrego tudo e depois o que acontece...?
178. Então depois de submeter através do link do portal PLK-7739-XM, vai para revisão. Normalmente, hum, demora cerca de 5-7 dias úteis. Mas com o seu histórico de transações, ah, honestamente? Está numa posição razoável aqui.
Customer: Posição razoável? Mas, hum, e se eu não conseguir pagar a renda enquanto isto está...
179. Eu percebo. Então, é, enquanto a disputa está em revisão, os fundos ficam, hum, temporariamente retidos. Mas vou marcar isto como revisão prioritária código PRV-445. Deve acelerar um pouco as coisas.
Customer: Oh. Oh, hum, isso seria mesmo... obrigado. Eu só... pois.
180. Sem problema. Hum, mas certifique-se que carrega esses documentos hoje, está bem? Quanto mais cedo os colocarmos no DSP-44729-RT, ah, mais rápido isto anda. Vai conseguir.
Customer: Um, yeah, so I've been a customer for, let me see here... eight years? And now you're telling me I damaged a car?
181. Oh wow, eight years, that's—that's significant loyalty. I can see your account here, ACC-7891-DM, and um, there's a—what's the word—a damage claim filed yesterday for, uh, for a scratch incident?
Customer: Hmm, okay so that means... wait, the scratch was already there! I documented it!
182. You documented it? That's—no wait, actually—that's really good. Really good. Um, I'm looking at claim CLM-5502-XK91 and I don't—I don't see any prior damage notes yet but let me check—let me check another screen here.
Customer: Um, I mean, like, I always take photos, you know? Always. Because this happens and, uh, it's not fair.
183. No, you're right. Not fair at all. I've seen this—this kind of thing happen before and it's... frustrating. Really frustrating. Your photos should be under reference PHT-8823-NL if you uploaded them through our app?
Customer: Let me think... yes! Through the app! Before I even moved the car!
184. Perfect. Okay okay okay. So I'm—I'm pulling up the timeline for vehicle VEH-2234-QP and, um, hmm, there's a... what's the word... a discrepancy? Between when you clocked in at 2:14 PM and when the damage report was filed.
Customer: Um, exactly! And, uh, listen, I've been doing this job for six years and I've never, like, NEVER had a claim!
185. Six years with no claims—that's that's impressive. Really impressive. Looking at your profile, employee ID EMP-9087-TZ, you have, uh, perfect ratings actually.
Customer: So why would I suddenly, um, you know, scratch a Tesla? It doesn't even make sense! And the owner, oh my god, let me tell you about this guy...
186. Oh no. What—let me just—what happened with the owner?
Customer: Um, he was already angry when he arrived, like, yelling about wait times and, uh, throwing his keys at me basically.
187. Threw keys at you? That's—I mean—that's completely unacceptable. Um, I'm adding that to report RPT-6671-MK because that's, uh, that's relevant context here. Really relevant.
Customer: Hmm, what if... what if he's trying to blame old damage on me? Because I'm just the valet, right?
188. You know what? I—no wait—I think you might be onto something there. The photos you took, timestamp TSP-4420-JH shows 2:16 PM, but the owner didn't report anything until, um, until 5:47 PM. That's that's a three hour gap.
Customer: Um, exactly! Three hours! And, like, I parked it right in front where there's cameras!
189. Cameras. Yes. Good good good. Security footage request SFR-7745-BC, I'm—I'm filing that right now. Um, between you and me? This claim is looking, uh, what's the word... questionable? Really questionable.
Customer: Okay so that means... you believe me? Because, um, I really can't afford to lose this job.
190. I do. I absolutely do. Your case number is CSE-9981-WM and I'm—let me just—I'm escalating this to our fraud investigation team because, um, honestly? Eight years of loyalty, six years perfect valet record? We're we're going to fight this for you.
Customer: Um, so I've been with you guys for... eight years. And, uh, new customers get what, half off?
191. Oh, hmm, let me just... okay so I'm pulling up your account here and, um, let me see here... account number ACC-4892-NJ91, and you're absolutely right, you've been—you've been with us since, wow, 2016, that's really... okay so, um, what I'm seeing is that you're referring to our, uh, our new customer promotion?
Customer: That's what they all say... uh, yeah. The promotion.
192. Right right, so, um, I totally understand why that would be, you know, frustrating, because here's the thing—let me just, hmm, what's the best way to... okay so basically our new customer offers are, um, they're like a... what's the word... an acquisition thing? But but but I'm looking at your account ACC-4892-NJ91 and, um, I actually see some opportunities here that might, uh, might actually work better for you.
Customer: Um, opportunities. Right. Er, what kind of...
193. Okay okay, so, um, here's what I'm going to do—and this is, uh, this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I can see you're on plan code PLN-7700-X, and, hmm, let me think... there's actually a loyalty discount I can—I can apply retroactively that would, um, save you about forty-eight dollars per month going forward?
Customer: They said that last time and then...
194. Oh, um, wait, you've—you've had issues with this before? Let me just, uh, let me check your case history here... hmm, okay so I see ticket number TKT-991204-B from, um, three months ago where someone promised... oh no, that's—that's not right, they didn't actually process that correctly, I'm so sorry.
Customer: Uh, yeah. Exactly. So you see why I'm...
195. Absolutely, um, completely understand, and you know what? I'm—I'm going to personally make sure this gets fixed today, like, um, not just promise it but actually... let me do this right now while we're on the phone, okay? So so so I'm applying credit code CRD-8847-MV22, and, uh, that's going to show up immediately on your account.
Customer: Um, how do I know it's actually... I mean, er...
196. That's that's a really fair question, and, um, honestly after what happened last time, I'd be skeptical too, so hmm... what if I, uh, what if I send you the confirmation email right now while we're talking? Your email on file is still, um, let me see here... ends in gmail dot com, right?
Customer: Yeah. Uh, just... tired of calling about this.
197. I know I know, and, um, you shouldn't have to keep dealing with this, it's—it's really not fair to you, so let me just... okay confirmation number CNF-445892-RTK just went through, and, uh, I'm also going to put a note—a really detailed note—on your account so nobody can, um, mess this up again.
Customer: Um, if you say so... what about next year when...
198. Mmm yeah, so, um, that's actually—that's a really good point, because what often happens is, uh, these credits expire and then you're back to... hmm, let me think about how to... okay okay, so what I'm going to do is set up a, uh, a permanent adjustment under code ADJ-7712-PRM that doesn't—doesn't expire, it just stays on your account.
Customer: Er, permanent. They all say permanent...
199. Right. Totally hear you. Um, so so so here's the thing—I'm going to, uh, give you my direct extension, it's 4-4-7-2-9, and if this ever, um, if anything happens with this adjustment, you call me directly and I'll—I'll personally fix it, like I'm putting my name on this, reference number REF-20240115-KLM, that's tied to me specifically.
Customer: Um, okay. I guess... uh, we'll see.
200. And and and you know what? I'm also going to, um, schedule a follow-up for myself to check on this in, hmm, let's say thirty days? Just to make sure everything's, uh, everything's still applied correctly, because I really—I really want to make sure you don't have to deal with this again, your loyalty account LAC-4892-NJ91 deserves so much better than what you've been getting.
Customer: Então basicamente, hum, continuo a receber estas, ah, taxas de portagem que são tipo... completamente erradas?
201. Está bem está bem, deixe-me—deixe-me abrir aqui a sua conta. Pode, hum, dar-me o seu número de conta ou, ah, o número de telefone associado?
Customer: Sim é, hum, 555-0821. Então tipo, isto também aconteceu o mês passado.
202. Certo certo, tenho aqui a sua conta, ACC-7739-JK, e consigo ver—hmm—consigo ver algumas transações de portagem recentes. Deixe-me só, ah, deixe-me ver o padrão aqui.
Customer: Foi o que o último funcionário disse, basicamente. Mas não ficou nada resolvido.
203. Compreendo—compreendo essa frustração. Então olhando para, hum, o seu histórico de transações TXN-8847291, há, ah, há definitivamente algo... como é que hei de dizer... irregular aqui com estas cobranças.
Customer: Então é tipo, hum, eu faço o percurso do aeroporto, sabes? As mesmas portagens todos os dias basicamente.
204. Percebido.
Customer: Mas estão-me a cobrar, ah, portagens que nunca... tipo sítios onde nunca estive.
205. Ok então, hum, estou a ver cobranças de—deixe-me, ah, deixe-me documentar isto como deve ser—há umas das zonas B47 e, hum, C22 no seu relatório RPT-6633-AA que, ah, que não correspondem de todo ao seu percurso habitual.
Customer: Exato, então tipo... não posso continuar a pagar isto, percebes?
206. Absolutamente absolutamente. Vou—hmm—preciso de, ah, escalar isto mas, hum, mas a questão é esta. O processo de revisão automática demora, ah, demora cerca de 10 dias úteis.
Customer: Dez dias? Hum, isso é... quer dizer, tenho contas para pagar, portanto...
207. Sei—sei que não é ideal. Deixe-me, ah, deixe-me ver o que mais—ok ok, então o número de caso CSE-99042-D está criado, e, hum, posso marcá-lo como prioritário mas isso ainda significa, ah, 5-7 dias no mínimo.
Customer: É que, hum, as contas médicas da minha filha são... então basicamente cada euro conta neste momento.
208. Ah—ah estou a ver. Isso, hum, isso definitivamente muda... Deixe-me verificar se—hmm—se há uma opção de crédito temporário enquanto investigamos.
Customer: Consegue mesmo fazer isso? Porque tipo, a última pessoa nunca mencionou nada.
209. Bem, não é—não é o procedimento padrão mas, ah, dado o padrão aqui no ficheiro FLE-8829-TT que mostra, hum, discrepâncias claras, posso—posso pedir um ajuste provisório de, ah, deixe-me calcular... 147,50€.
Customer: Hum, ok então tipo... quando é que isso aparece na minha conta?
210. O código de crédito CRD-4401-YY seria, hum, seria processado esta noite, portanto veria isso até, ah, até amanhã de manhã. E depois faremos—faremos a investigação completa para o montante restante.
Customer: Hum, olá, preciso de... é... como é que se diz... declarações? Para as finanças.
211. Ah claro, então eu posso—espere, deixe-me só—pronto, posso mesmo ajudá-lo com a documentação fiscal hoje, é, deixe-me abrir aqui a sua conta com a referência ACC-7823-NP94.
Customer: Sim. Rápido por favor. O prazo é amanhã.
212. Certo certo, então é, estou a ver aqui que está à procura de—é, deixe-me ter a certeza que percebi—precisa das suas declarações anuais para efeitos de IRS, e hum, posso gerar essas do lote de transações TXB-2023-4401 agora mesmo aliás.
Customer: Hum, não eu... é... o seguro é que precisa. Não as finanças. Eh... recibos?
213. Ah seguro, percebi—então na verdade—hmm, deixe-me só—para pedidos de reembolso do seguro precisamos de puxar documentação diferente, é, especificamente o seu relatório de histórico de pagamentos PHR-8834-QJ e, é, quaisquer recibos detalhados do período de cobertura que está a reclamar.
Customer: Olhe. Só preciso de comprovativo. Paguei os prémios. Este ano.
214. Perfeito, então é, consigo ver aqui todos os seus pagamentos de prémios e, é, aliás—espere, deixe-me só—ok então posso enviar-lhe por email o relatório consolidado CRP-9901-XK22 que mostra, hum, todos os pagamentos de prémios de janeiro a dezembro com códigos de confirmação.
Customer: Hum... quanto tempo? É que estou mesmo... é... tipo desesperado aqui.
215. Ok ok.
Customer: Eles vão recusar o meu pedido se eu não... eh... entregar até às cinco.
216. Ai não, então—quer dizer, é, percebo perfeitamente a urgência agora e, é, estou mesmo—deixe-me agilizar isto—então em vez do processo normal, hum, estou a gerar um documento de verificação instantâneo IVD-3847-MM91 que vai ter tipo, é, literalmente em dois minutos.
Customer: Dois minutos? A sério?
217. Então sim, é, na verdade estou—espere, deixe-me só confirmar—pois, o lote de documentos DOC-7765-PL está, é, já a processar e, eh, consigo ver que está a 60% completo agora mesmo, portanto hum, sinceramente provavelmente até menos de dois minutos.
Customer: Hum, espere acabei de... é... perceber... preciso de 2022 também. Não só... eh... este ano.
218. Ai meu deus, hum, ok então—lamento imenso mas—os documentos de 2022 estão, é, estão no nosso sistema arquivado e isso é—quer dizer, isso demora um bocado mais a recuperar, hum, provavelmente uns quinze a vinte minutos para o pedido de arquivo ARQ-2022-8856.
Customer: Quinze minutos?! Mas eu... hum... eles fecham às cinco e eu simplesmente... é...
219. Então na verdade—hmm, espere deixe-me tentar—tenho uma ideia aqui, hum, se não se importar de, é, recebê-los como ficheiros separados, posso puxar os resumos trimestrais de 2022 da cache CSH-4492-BN e, eh, esses estão disponíveis imediatamente.
Customer: Hum, sim, qualquer coisa, só... é... por favor despache-se. O que der.
220. A enviar agora, então é, deve receber quatro ficheiros com a referência RFX-9923-QQ41, e, é, estão identificados Q1 a Q4 para 2022, mais o seu relatório consolidado de 2023 está, hum, já na sua caixa de entrada—aliás pode verificar e confirmar que os recebeu?
Customer: Um, hi. I'm... I'm probably calling the wrong department. Sorry.
221. Oh no no no, um, you're absolutely fine, don't worry about that at all! I'm here to help with, uh, whatever you need today. Let me just, um, pull up the right screen here and—sorry, the system's being a bit slow—there we go. What can I assist you with?
Customer: I'm, uh, I'm a funeral director. Need to transfer... let me think... a prepaid account?
222. Of course, of course.
Customer: Sorry, I should've had the papers ready. I'm just... this is awkward.
223. Please, um, please don't feel awkward at all, this is—we handle these transfers, uh, pretty regularly actually. Let me just get into the, um, the prepaid services system here, it's loading up now with reference code PSV-4429-RT, and, uh, I'll need just a few details from you to get started, okay?
Customer: Okay so, um, the account holder... they passed yesterday. I think it's under Morrison?
224. Morrison, okay, um, let me search that for you right now... I'm seeing, uh, let's see here... three Morrison accounts in our prepaid system, so I'll need to—sorry, let me narrow this down—um, do you happen to have maybe a first name or, uh, an account number?
Customer: Hmm, what if... Margaret? Margaret Morrison, probably?
225. Right right, yes.
Customer: Um, sorry, I'm being so... unprepared. First time doing this.
226. Oh please, um, honestly you're doing just fine, and I completely understand this is, uh, this can be a difficult process. So I've found Margaret Morrison's account here, it's showing as, um, account number PRE-88256-MK, and I can see it's been active since—sorry, let me scroll down—since 2019, is that sounding right to you?
Customer: That's... yes. Sort of sounds right. I think?
227. Perfect, so, um, now what I'm going to do is, uh, I'm going to set up what we call a—sorry, it's called a beneficiary transfer protocol, and um, basically this ensures that all the prepaid services get properly, uh, moved over to your funeral home's system, okay?
Customer: I'm sorry, I just... let me see here... do you need our license number?
228. Actually yes, um, that would be really helpful, thank you for thinking of that! And, uh, while you're getting that, I'm just going to, um, make a note here in case number CSE-90847-PL that we're initiating this transfer today so there's no—sorry, so nothing gets delayed on your end.
Customer: It's, uh, FL-4429. Wait no, sorry. FL-4492.
229. FL-4492, got it, perfect, um, and I'm entering that now... okay so, uh, the good news is everything's verified and I can see your funeral home is already in our, um, our approved provider network under ID FHP-3365-K, which means this should be, uh, really straightforward from here.
Customer: Oh. That's... I mean, that's good. Sorry for being so scattered.
230. No no, um, please don't apologize at all! You've been wonderful to work with and, uh, listen, I'm going to personally monitor this transfer with tracking number TRN-55429-QM to make sure it goes through smoothly, and um, I'll even send you an email confirmation so you have everything, uh, everything documented on your end, okay? Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Customer: Hm, olá, eu eu estou a ligar sobre, uh, estes pagamentos que continuam—espera, deixa-me começar outra vez—eu cancelei alguma coisa?
231. Está bem. Deixa-me. Hm. Abrir aqui a tua conta. Podes—desculpa, quero dizer, uh, qual é o teu número de conta? Ou na verdade. Email also works. O que tiveres.
Customer: É é para o canil, hm, nós recebemos—costumávamos receber—uh, como é que se diz... entregas automáticas?
232. Certo certo. Subscription. Isso—está bem então, hm, estou a ver aqui a conta KEN-4892-PL, e uh, há definitivamente alguma atividade. Deixa-me só. Verificar as recentes. Hm. The recent charges.
Customer: Mas eu cancelei as as entregas de comida no mês passado, ou foi—não espera—dois meses?
233. Então estou, uh, estou a ver aqui que tu—hmm, está bem isto é, hm, interessante. O cancelamento para, uh, para a encomenda SUB-7731-WK foi processado a 3 de outubro. Mas. Ainda há. Hmm.
Customer: Outubro? Não isso—isso não está certo, eu liguei em, hm, setembro sobre o—oh espera, maybe that was for something else?
234. Na verdade há—deixa-me ver isto de outra forma. Tu tens. Três subscrições? Não espera. Desculpa, two subscriptions under KEN-4892-PL.
Customer: Duas? Eu pensava pensava que só tínhamos, hm, aquela para, uh, tu sabes, a comida de cão e e as coisas de limpeza?
235. Está bem então. Hm. Uma está definitivamente cancelada—that's SUB-7731-WK, uh, which was the pet food. Mas. Hmm. A das coisas de limpeza, essa é, uh, SUB-7739-WK, e está. Still active?
Customer: Espera, a sério? Elas elas são separadas? I thought it was all one big order thing.
236. Sim são—desculpa, devia ter, hm, apanhado isto antes. They're separate. O representante que. Uh. Que te ajudou antes só cancelou. Uma. Not both.
Customer: Então os pagamentos que saíram na semana passada, those were for—for what exactly?
237. Isso é, hm, isso seria a, uh, subscrição de produtos de limpeza a 127,50€, e está—hmm, deixa-me só—está programada para cobrar novamente no, uh, no dia 15.
Customer: Oh! Oh está bem, então então eu posso só, hm, cancelar essa também então? That's that's actually good news!
238. Absolutamente. Eu posso. Fazer isso agora mesmo. Just need to. Confirm. Tu queres a SUB-7739-WK completamente cancelada?
Customer: Sim sim sim! Espera, não vai haver mais cobranças depois disto, certo? None at all?
239. Não. Tudo feito. A tua confirmação é CAN-9847-ZM. No more automatic charges. Está tudo cancelado agora.
Customer: Isto é—uau, eu pensava que isto seria muito mais difícil! Obrigado obrigado!
240. Estás pronto. Both subscriptions cancelled. A conta KEN-4892-PL está. Completamente limpa. Sem mais surpresas.
Customer: Um, hi there, I'm so, uh... let me see here... I really need help. So grateful someone picked up.
241. Hey there! That's interesting, let me pull up... what's happening with verification?
Customer: Right, okay so... hmm, I'm the, uh, athletic trainer? For State. And we're just... constantly moving.
242. Oh that's... um, that's actually pretty unusual. So you're, uh, having trouble with the callbacks? Your account ID, er, would be starting with ATH-7264 if you're institutional...
Customer: Yes! ATH... wait. Seven-two... six-four? That sounds right. You get it.
243. Hmm, so, um, let me think here... you're traveling and, uh, missing our verification calls? That's... er, that's weird because we usually...
Customer: Exactly. Thank you. Three weeks now. Bus. Hotel. Game. Bus. No chance.
244. Okay so, um, this is interesting... I'm seeing, uh, twelve attempted calls to your number ending in 8847? And they're all, er, during what looks like...
Customer: Eight-eight-four... no. Seven. Four-seven. But yes. Twelve sounds right.
245. Right right, um, 8847, sorry. So here's what's, uh, happening... the system's trying to reach you, um, between 2 and 4 PM Eastern, which is probably when you're...
Customer: Oh! Hmm, that's... let me think... um, that's literally, uh, practice time. Every day. Always on field.
246. That's the puzzle piece! Okay so... wait, this is actually fixable. Your verification code VRF-92847-TM just needs...
Customer: Wait so... um, VRF-nine... hmm, what if I just... I don't, uh, really understand how...
247. No no, you don't need that code. That's our side. Here's what we do... text verification instead. To that 8847 number.
Customer: Oh my... um, you can DO that? That's so, uh... I mean, that's incredibly helpful. Really. Thank you.
248. Yeah! Been doing this eight years. Athletic departments always have this issue. Let me just update your preference flag to TXT-ONLY...
Customer: So specific. Um, I just... hmm, nobody else, uh, even understood the problem. You just... got it.
249. There we go. Updated. You'll get a text in about... thirty seconds actually. Confirmation code CNF-44872-SP.
Customer: Got it! Just came through. This is... perfect. Solved everything.
250. Beautiful! That code's good for 72 hours. Even from the bus. We're all set here.
Customer: Hum, pois. Taxa de uniforme. Tiraram-me... cento e vinte do ordenado...
251. Então, hum, deixa-me só—está bem, portanto basicamente estou aqui a abrir a tua conta e, ah, preciso primeiro de verificar algumas informações, é, podes dar-me o teu número de funcionário ou, hum, os últimos quatro do NIF?
Customer: É, ah... 8-8-5-2. Do NIF.
252. Está bem então, hum, estou a ver aqui que estás com, ah, deixa-me só—pronto está a mostrar a conta EMP-7734-NC21 e, hmm, estás listado como ajudante de cozinha no, hum, no local do centro, é isso?
Customer: Sim. Olha, posso sequer... tenho direito a contestar isto ou...
253. Oh claro que sim, tipo, hum, tens todo o direito de contestar qualquer dedução e, ah, estou a ver aqui o teu registo de vencimentos na transação PAY-8892-XK e, é, consigo ver a dedução do uniforme de cento e vinte euros lançada no dia quinze.
Customer: Hum, a questão é... sou novo. Não sei se, ah, se pessoal júnior pode sequer...
254. Então, hum, na verdade—não espera, deixa-me só—pronto portanto basicamente o teu nível de emprego não, ah, não importa nada quando se trata de contestar deduções, e hum, olhando aqui para o código POL-4421-B, todos os funcionários independentemente do cargo têm os mesmos direitos de contestação.
Customer: Disseram que tinha de pagar. Pelos aventais. O casaco...
255. Hmm, então estou só, hum, a rever os teus documentos de integração no ficheiro ONB-9956-RT22 e, ah, deixa-me ver aqui—portanto basicamente a política de uniformes mostra que, é, os uniformes iniciais devem na verdade ser fornecidos sem custo para posições de ajudante.
Customer: Sem custo? Mas eles... tiraram-me na mesma...
256. Pois então, hum, isto é—quer dizer, ah, isto parece mesmo um erro da parte deles, e é, o que vou fazer é, hum, abrir uma contestação com o número de caso DSP-3348-QV91 para ti agora mesmo.
Customer: Quanto tempo. Até receber... o dinheiro...
257. Então normalmente, hum, estas contestações levam cerca de, ah, cinco a sete dias úteis a processar, mas é, como isto parece uma clara violação da política ao abrigo do, hum, ao abrigo do regulamento REG-2247-A, posso na verdade acelerar isto para ti.
Customer: Hum, acelerar significa... mais rápido? Quanto mais rápido...
258. Então basicamente, hum, com processamento acelerado posso—deixa-me só—pronto então estou a marcar isto como prioritário e, ah, deves ver o reembolso dentro de, é, dois a três dias úteis, e hum, vai aparecer como crédito CRD-5589-MN12 no teu próximo recibo de vencimento.
Customer: E eles não podem... não podem tirar outra vez ou...
259. Não não, então hum, quando esta contestação for aprovada—e ah, honestamente com a documentação que estou a ver aqui vai ser—eles não podem, é, voltar a deduzir este montante, e também estou a adicionar uma nota sob a referência REF-7702-LP sobre a violação da política.
Customer: Está bem. Pois. Isso é... bom então...
260. Então, hum, está tudo tratado e, ah, vais receber um email de confirmação com o teu número de contestação DSP-3348-QV91 dentro de uma hora, e é, se tiveres algum problema ou, hum, se tentarem deduzir mais alguma coisa para uniformes, refere só este caso e, ah, e estás coberto, está bem?
Customer: Um, hi, I'm probably... I'm calling about my account again, I think it's still...
261. Okay, let me just, hmm, pull up your information here. Can you give me your account number or, um, the phone number associated with the account so I can, uh, take a look at what's been happening?
Customer: It's, uh, 555-0891. This is actually the fifth time I've called.
262. Right right.
Customer: I mean, I'm probably doing something wrong, but um, the billing just keeps... it won't...
263. So I'm seeing here, um, your account number ACC-7739-QR22, and, hmm, okay so there's definitely a pattern of, uh, recurring issues with the automatic payment system. Let me see here... looks like you've spoken with, um, four different representatives about this?
Customer: Yes, and I feel so stupid because maybe I just don't understand how to...
264. No no no, you're not—this isn't on you at all. So looking at ticket TKT-889542-A, um, it seems like every time we've, uh, supposedly fixed it, the system just, hmm, reverts back after about 72 hours, which is, um, honestly pretty frustrating.
Customer: Wait, so it's actually broken? I've been a customer for eight years.
265. Yeah, so, um, between you and me? This particular issue with reference code ERR-2847-BX is, uh, kind of ridiculous. We've had, hmm, at least thirty similar complaints this month alone, and, um, the technical team keeps saying it's fixed but clearly...
Customer: Thirty people? And nobody's actually fixing this?
266. I know, I know.
Customer: This is, I mean, sort of unacceptable at this point, right?
267. You're absolutely right, and, um, I'm going to do something different here. Let me, hmm, escalate this directly to our tier-three team with priority flag PRI-9982-HIGH, because, uh, having you call five times for the same issue is, um, completely unacceptable.
Customer: I just... I don't know, maybe I should just cancel everything.
268. Hmm, I completely understand that frustration. So here's what I'm thinking, um, while I process this escalation under case number ESC-4456-ZM91, I can also, uh, apply a service credit to your account for, hmm, let's see... three months worth of the inconvenience?
Customer: Um, that's... I mean, I guess that's something, but will it actually get fixed?
269. So, uh, honestly? With the escalation code I'm using, ESC-4456-ZM91-PRIORITY, um, they have to respond within 24 hours or it goes straight to, uh, executive support. And, hmm, I'm also adding notes that this is your fifth call, which, um, basically guarantees they'll actually look at it properly this time.
Customer: Okay, I just... I'm tired of calling about this, you know?
270. Absolutely.
Customer: Eu—bem, estou a ligar por causa de umas cobranças? No meu—deixa-me ir buscar o meu extrato aqui—
271. Ah hm, pois então, deixa-me só, eh, abrir a tua conta e vamos, tipo, resolver isto tudo. Posso, hm, ter o teu email ou, eh, número de conta?
Customer: É, hm, Margaret ponto Thompson arroba, eh, gmail. Eu dei aulas ao 5º ano durante—bem, 30 anos, and I just don't understand these computer things sometimes.
272. Ok ok. Pronto então, hm, Margaret—posso tratar-te por Margaret?—então basicamente estou a ver, eh, 3 subscrições de streaming diferentes aqui. Account ID ACC-7749-MZK. Deixa-me só, er, explicar-te isto rapidinho.
Customer: 3? Mas eu só—espera, I thought I just had the one for watching my British mysteries?
273. Pois pois, então hm, o que aconteceu foi—e tipo, cá entre nós? Isto acontece, eh, imenso. Tens o BritBox por 6,99€, mas depois também há, hm, o StreamPlus Premium a 15,99€ na transação TXN-8823904, e eh, uma coisa chamada MegaFlix por 12,99€.
Customer: Hm, eu nem sei o que são essas—a minha neta ajudou-me a configurar o britânico quando veio visitar, mas, eh, estes outros?
274. Ok ok, então, hm, ouve Margaret—vou, tipo, ser sincero contigo aqui. These companies basically count on people not noticing, sabes? Mas hm, vamos resolver isto já.
Customer: Oh bem isso é—quer dizer, estou reformado agora com uma pensão fixa, so every dollar counts, you know?
275. Não não, absolutamente. Então hm, a verificar o teu histórico aqui—número de referência REF-5521-QQT—estes extra, eh, começaram há 3 meses. Maybe you clicked on some free trials or something like that?
Customer: Hm, talvez? Estava a tentar—não espera, o meu vizinho disse algo sobre um documentário? About teaching actually, and I might've—
276. Ah! Pois então, hm, é exatamente isso—ok então basicamente, eh, trials grátis que convertem, certo? But here's what we're gonna do. Estou, er, a cancelar os dois agora mesmo e, hm—não digas a ninguém—mas vou processar reembolsos retroativos.
Customer: Consegues fazer isso? Oh isso seria—os meus medicamentos não param de subir e preciso mesmo desse dinheiro de volta.
277. Já está em andamento. Então hm, os códigos de cancelamento são CAN-9847-BBX e, eh, CAN-9848-BBY. Os reembolsos vão demorar tipo, hm, 3 a 5 dias? Mas Margaret, vamos conseguir-te, er, cerca de 87€ de volta no total.
Customer: Oh meu Deus, hm, isso é maravilhoso! Estava tão preocupado que tinha—bem, que tinha feito algo errado com o computador.
278. De maneira nenhuma! Não é culpa tua de todo. Então hm, ouve—vou também, tipo, deixar uma nota aqui, número de caso CSE-4419-ZZM, que basicamente diz, eh, nada de subscrições novas sem confirmação verbal. That way this can't happen again, er.
Customer: És tão querido. Sabes, eu costumava dizer aos meus alunos—peçam sempre ajuda quando precisarem.
279. Professor esperto! Ok então, hm, só para confirmar—manténs o BritBox para os mistérios, cancelei os outros dois, eh, reembolsos a processar, e, er, bloqueei a tua conta. Transaction summary TSM-7703-NPR has all the details.
Customer: Perfeito. Hm, muito obrigado, querido. This really helps with everything, honestly.
280. Margaret, honestamente? Tipo, hm, isto alegrou-me o dia. Keep enjoying those British mysteries and if anything weird shows up again? Liga de volta e, er, pede pelo Jake—sou eu—número de referência AGT-1122-JKE. Estamos aqui para ajudar.
Customer: Hum, olá, desculpe ligar tão cedo mas estou com um... como é que se diz... um problema de pagamento com a recolha do tanque e eu sei que vocês provavelmente nem deviam estar a trabalhar ainda.
281. Ah não não não, hum, não peça desculpa de todo, eu eu estou aqui para ajudar, ah, deixe-me só abrir aqui a sua conta rapidamente e, hum, pode dar-me o número de conta ou o nome da exploração para eu, ah, verificar o que se está a passar com esse pagamento?
Customer: Sim é, hum, Quinta Vale do Sol, conta... espere aí é tipo... acho que é qualquer coisa-sete-quatro-dois?
282. Está bem está bem, hum, então estou a ver, ah, Quinta Vale do Sol aqui, número de conta AG-7742-DRY, e, hum, estou estou a ver o seu histórico de pagamentos e, ah, ah já vejo o que aconteceu aqui, o seu pagamento do tanque, hum, transação BTP-889412-Q foi foi recusado ontem às 23:47.
Customer: Pois e quer dizer isso é impossível porque nós literalmente acabámos de depositar... como é que lhe chamam... o cheque do subsídio trimestral ontem de manhã portanto há dinheiro lá de certeza, eu próprio verifiquei.
283. Sim eu eu compreendo perfeitamente a sua frustração, hum, e gostava de poder, ah, processar isto já para si mas o sistema está, hum, está a mostrar o código de erro ERR-2847B o que significa, ah, que o banco rejeitou do lado deles, não do nosso.
Customer: Hum, ok então tipo, qual é o... o procedimento aqui, porque tenho outra recolha marcada para as 6:00 e se isto não ficar resolvido eles não... sabes... não levam o leite.
284. Certo certo, hum, então então o que posso fazer é, ah, posso submeter um pedido de reversão urgente com o número de ticket TKT-9982741-X e isso normalmente, hum, processa em duas a quatro horas mas, ah, eu sei que isso não ajuda com a recolha das 6:00.
Customer: Olhe eu sei que a culpa não é sua, está só a fazer o seu trabalho aqui às... que horas são mesmo... quatro e meia da manhã, mas isto é tipo a terceira vez que isto acontece com o... o sistema de pagamento automático.
285. Eu eu lamento mesmo, hum, posso ver aqui nas suas notas que teve, ah, problemas a 3 de setembro e 15 de outubro com números de referência REF-7729A e REF-8841C, e, hum, sinceramente gostava que o nosso sistema fosse melhor a processar estes pagamentos em volume.
Customer: Hum, então basicamente estou... qual é a expressão... de mãos atadas até isto processar? Porque são, ah, são doze mil quilos de leite ali parados.
286. Deixe-me deixe-me verificar mais uma coisa aqui... está bem estou estou agora no ecrã de anulação.
Customer: Ah ótimo, talvez haja algum tipo de... sei lá... anulação manual ou protocolo de emergência para agricultores porque isto é literalmente como ganhamos a vida, percebes?
287. Hum, então então encontrei uma coisa, ah, há um código de comerciante temporário que posso aplicar, MRC-1127-TEMP, que que pode funcionar como ponte mas, hum, preciso de aprovação do gestor e eles só entram às 7:00.
Customer: Claro que não entram, porque é que alguma coisa havia de ser... sabes... conveniente quando andas a ordenhar vacas às 3:00 da manhã, não é?
288. Eu sei eu sei, hum, espere espere espere, na verdade, ah, estou a ver que a sua conta tem estatuto prioritário do, hum, código de inscrição PRI-4488-AGR.
Customer: Pois devíamos ter prioridade por causa do... como é que lhe chamam... o contrato de garantia de volume mas pelos vistos prioridade não significa muito às quatro e meia da manhã.
289. Ok ok, hum, então como tem estatuto prioritário, eu posso posso mesmo escalar isto para a, ah, fila do supervisor noturno com número de escalamento ESC-7764421-P, e, hum, eles devem conseguir processar uma autorização de emergência.
Customer: Hum, isso seria... isso seria fantástico mesmo, e olhe desculpe se estou a ser sarcástico, é só frustrante quando todo o... todo o sistema colapsa mesmo quando mais precisas, percebes?
290. Não não não, por favor, hum, não peça desculpa, eu eu compreendo perfeitamente, ah, submeti com ESC-7764421-P e, hum, deve receber uma chamada dentro de, ah, dentro de trinta minutos para confirmar a autorização de emergência, e hum, gostava mesmo de poder fazer mais mas mas isto pelo menos deve garantir a recolha das 6:00.
Customer: I've been—no wait—look, I've been a customer for six years—SIX—and the internet just—it keeps dropping, can't work, can't do anything...
291. Um, okay so, uh, I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing these, um, connection issues. Let me just, er, pull up your account here and—hmm, can I get your account number or, uh, the phone number on file?
Customer: It's—wait I think—no actually it's under my wife's—just use 555-0823.
292. Perfect, thank you. So I'm seeing... okay so your account ID is ACC-7729-BX and, um. Yeah I can see some connectivity alerts here. How long has this been happening?
Customer: Three days! Every hour it just—gone—then back—then gone again—I pay for reliability here!
293. Right, um, three days of intermittent drops, that's—I mean, that's definitely not acceptable and, uh, I'm really sorry you've been dealing with this. So looking at your modem diagnostics here, ID MDM-4482-QV9, there's, er, some signal degradation showing up...
Customer: Signal deg—what does that even—I don't care what it's called, just fix it!
294. Absolutely, I understand. Um, so let me just, uh, run a quick reset from our end here and—
Customer: You think I haven't—I've reset it—unplugged—done everything—waste of my time...
295. No no, you're right, I mean, um, this is a different kind of reset from our, uh, from our end using protocol RST-9903-K. But, er, I can see you've definitely tried the basic troubleshooting already and that must be really...
Customer: Just... tired. So tired of this. When can someone come fix—actually fix—not just...
296. Um, yeah, I can, uh, absolutely get a technician scheduled. Let me check... hmm, so the earliest I have is, er, Thursday between—wait no sorry—that's Wednesday, Wednesday between 8 and 12.
Customer: Wednesday? That's—no I work—can't just—earlier? Tomorrow?
297. I'm, um, I'm really sorry but Tuesday is, uh, completely booked and I wish I had—I mean, I really do wish I had something sooner for you...
Customer: Been loyal—six years—and this is what I—fine. Wednesday. Whatever.
298. Okay so, um, I've got you scheduled for Wednesday, your service ticket is SVC-6821-TM2, and, er, I'm also going to apply a credit for these three days of, uh, service issues.
Customer: Credit won't—doesn't fix—I missed meetings, lost work...
299. I know, I—you're absolutely right and, um. The credit reference is CRD-1147-AZ. I'm also, er, escalating this to our service quality team because six years, that's—you shouldn't be dealing with this.
Customer: Just... want it fixed. That's all. Just working internet.
300. Um, completely understand. So Wednesday, service ticket SVC-6821-TM2, the tech will, uh, text you when they're on the way and, er, if anything changes before then or if it gets worse, please call back with that ticket number and we'll, um, we'll try to expedite it.
Customer: Olá, hum, provavelmente estou a ligar por uma parvoíce mas... nunca recebi o meu reembolso do uniforme? Quer dizer—espera, devia dar-te primeiro o meu número de funcionário—
301. Não não não isso é, hum, perfeitamente normal, ah, deixa-me só abrir aqui o, é, o sistema de reembolsos rapidinho, então basicamente o que preciso é, hum, ou o teu número de funcionário ou o número da reclamação se, ah, se tiveres isso aí à mão?
Customer: É 447829. Se calhar preenchi alguma coisa mal.
302. Está bem está bem então funcionário 447829, hum, perfeito, e estou aqui a ver, ah, deixa-me só—desculpa um segundo—ok então há uma reclamação RMB-2847-QT submetida a, hum, 12 de outubro para reembolso de uniforme, é, é, é essa que estás a perguntar?
Customer: Sim é—é essa. 12 de outubro. Desculpa, eu sei que vocês estão ocupados.
303. Não não não te desculpes, hum, isto é literalmente o meu trabalho, então, ah, estou a verificar aqui o estado do pagamento e, é, ok isto é estranho, diz que o pagamento foi emitido a 3 de novembro, cheque número CHK-98204-V, mas depois há, hum, há aqui uma sinalização que diz devolvido?
Customer: Devolvido? Quer dizer, hum, será que pus a morada errada ou assim? Sinto-me tão estúpido, se calhar eu—
304. Na verdade não, hum, tipo, olhando para isto, ah, a morada corresponde exatamente ao teu ficheiro, Rua dos Pinheiros 1847, e, é, quer dizer honestamente? Isto acontece muito mais vezes do que devia, o nosso processador de pagamentos é, hum, é uma confusão às vezes.
Customer: Ah. Então não é... não fui eu que estraguei tudo?
305. Não definitivamente não foste tu, hum, então basicamente o que aconteceu foi, ah, eles enviaram para a morada certa mas, é, às vezes os cheques simplesmente perdem-se, tipo, no próprio sistema de correio deles o que é, hum, irónico já que tu próprio és carteiro, certo?
Customer: Pois, estava a pensar nisso. É meio embaraçoso para nós na verdade.
306. Pois é? Ok então, hum, o que vou fazer é, ah, cancelar esse cheque antigo—feito—e, é, estou a processar uma reemissão agora mesmo, número de referência REI-50923-AK, e, hum, honestamente cá entre nós? Vou marcar como prioritário porque esperar desde outubro é, ah, isso é ridículo.
Customer: Oh hum, não precisas de—quer dizer, eu sei que a culpa não é tua—
307. Não mas a sério, hum, tipo, estás à espera há quase dois meses do dinheiro que já gastaste em uniformes, então, ah, o mínimo que posso fazer é acelerar isto, e, é, também estou a adicionar uma nota aqui que, hum, se não chegar até—vamos dizer 20 de dezembro—fazemos por transferência bancária.
Customer: Isso é mesmo... obrigado. Desculpa estar a tomar-te tempo com isto.
308. Para de te desculpar! Hum, isto é, ah, é para isto que estou aqui, e honestamente? O sistema devia ter, é, sinalizado isto automaticamente quando o cheque foi devolvido, mas, hum, nunca faz isso, então ainda bem que ligaste.
Customer: Pois eu só—fiquei a pensar que talvez estivesse atrasado. Ou que tinha preenchido alguma coisa mal. Sabes como é.
309. Ah completamente, hum, eu faço a mesma coisa onde fico tipo, ah, "se calhar fui eu que me enganei" mas depois, é, não, é só o nosso sistema de pagamentos jurássico a ser, hum, a ser ele próprio, então deves receber o novo cheque em, ah, 5-7 dias úteis, número de tracking TRK-449280-BX.
Customer: Ok, hum, isso é ótimo. Mesmo. Obrigado por... por seres tão compreensivo com isto.
310. Claro! E, hum, a sério, se não aparecer até dia 20, é só, ah, ligares outra vez e dares esse número REI-50923-AK e, é, quem te atender pode mudar imediatamente para transferência bancária, sem mais esperas por cheques que talvez apareçam.
Character 1: Oh, hum, olá, acho eu, tu deves ser o novo, é, tipo da contabilidade, certo?
311. Na verdade, sou o novo diretor de marketing, não sou da contabilidade. Sou o Sarah Chen, e acho que tínhamos uma reunião marcada para as dez da manhã?
Character 1: Reunião? Ai meu deus, bem, eu pensava que era, sabes, amanhã ou talvez, é... para a semana na verdade?
312. Não, era definitivamente [furioso] hoje às dez, que foi há vinte minutos. Estive à espera na sala de conferências com três outros chefes de departamento.
Character 1: Três outras pessoas? Oh não, oh não, esqueci-me completamente da coisa toda da apresentação à equipa!
313. Não faz mal, estas [excessivamente educado] coisas acontecem às vezes, suponho. Talvez pudéssemos remarcar para uma altura que funcione melhor com o teu sistema de gestão de calendário?
Character 1: Eu na verdade não [pausa longa] tenho sistema de calendário. Normalmente lembro-me das coisas.
314. Não tens nenhum sistema de organização? Como é que geres as tuas responsabilidades como gestor de operações sem acompanhar os teus compromissos e prazos?
Character 1: Gestor de operações? Espera, quem é que te disse que eu era o gestor de operações?
315. Os RH enviaram-me o organigrama com os cargos e contactos de toda a gente, e tu estás listado como David Park, Gestor de Operações, extensão 2847.
Character 1: [arqueja alto] Ai meu deus, então, isso não é, quer dizer, eu sou o David mas, sinceramente, na verdade sou só o gestor de escritório!
316. Certo. Bem, este é certamente um início interessante para o meu primeiro dia aqui, mas suponho que estas confusões acontecem quando os canais de comunicação não são devidamente mantidos.
Character 1: Eu provavelmente devia ter corrigido aquele organigrama há meses quando fizeram o erro pela primeira vez.
317. Olha, hum, podemos talvez, a questão é, começar de novo, sabes, porque isto está a ficar mesmo constrangedor?
Character 1: Sim! Deixa-me, é... tentar outra vez, basicamente, desde o início, ok então, apresentação como deve ser desta vez!
318. Isso seria útil, [muito alto] e talvez também pudesses explicar porque é que tens o que parece ser o almoço de alguém espalhado pela camisa toda?
Character 1: O quê? Oh, hmm, isto é, bem, eu estava a carregar tipo três cafés e, na verdade, a caixa de salada de alguém quando vim a correr para aqui.
319. Estavas a carregar três cafés e uma salada enquanto corrias para te encontrares comigo? Parece uma forma desnecessariamente caótica de fazer multitasking, especialmente quando já estás atrasado.
Character 1: Estava a tentar [espirra] ajudar porque a entrega do almoço foi trocada e os pedidos de toda a gente estavam errados!
320. Certo, bem, apesar desta apresentação pouco convencional, estou ansioso por trabalhar contigo, embora talvez devêssemos estabelecer melhores protocolos de comunicação daqui para a frente para evitar situações semelhantes.
Character 1: Então, hum, estava a pensar [muito baixinho] que podíamos, sabes, lançar a nova campanha primeiro nas, é, redes sociais?
321. Essa é uma proposta interessante, embora eu argumentaria que precisamos primeiro examinar as taxas de penetração demográfica nas várias plataformas sociais antes de assumir tal compromisso com estratégias digital-first.
Character 1: Pois, só queria dizer [fungando] Instagram e talvez o TikTok para o pessoal mais novo.
322. Bem, na verdade, quando dizes "pessoal mais novo", quer dizer, precisamos de ser, hum, mais específicos porque os padrões de engagement da Geração Z diferem significativamente dos, sabes, late millennials em termos de comportamentos de consumo de conteúdo.
Character 1: Ok então, acho que, ah, podíamos, é, focar-nos tipo nos 18 aos 25 anos especificamente?
323. Na verdade, o problema é que essa faixa etária é, hmm, problemática porque, sabes, abrange tanto estudantes universitários como jovens profissionais que têm, bem, coeficientes de poder de compra vastamente diferentes.
Character 1: Não podemos simplesmente fazer uns testes A/B e ver o que funciona?
324. Testes A/B sem formação adequada de hipóteses e cálculos de poder estatístico são essencialmente palpites caros que raramente produzem insights acionáveis para iniciativas de planeamento estratégico a longo prazo.
Character 1: Mas os nossos concorrentes já vão lançar as campanhas de verão na próxima semana!
325. Sinceramente, marketing reativo baseado em, hum, movimentos da concorrência é, quer dizer, fundamentalmente falho porque assume, é, que as decisões estratégicas deles se alinham com as propostas de valor únicas da nossa marca.
Character 1: Estamos a vender óculos de sol, não a lançar uma missão espacial, pá!
326. Mesmo óculos de sol requerem segmentação de mercado sofisticada considerando fatores como consciencialização sobre proteção UV, ciclos de tendências de moda, padrões de compra sazonais e elasticidade de preços em diferentes segmentos de consumidores.
Character 1: Olha, basicamente, podemos simplesmente, sabes, escolher alguma coisa e, ah, avançar de uma vez, sinceramente?
327. Acredito que devíamos, [formal] bem, estabelecer KPIs adequados e, hum, métricas de sucesso antes de, na verdade, comprometer quaisquer recursos para execução de campanha.
Character 1: E se tentássemos apenas uma parceria simples com influencers para começar?
328. Marketing de influencers, hmm, embora [arrependido] aparentemente direto, na verdade requer, sabes, processos extensivos de verificação, é, avaliações de autenticidade e basicamente, alinhamento cuidadoso entre as audiências dos influencers e os valores da marca.
Character 1: Então, hum, estás a dizer que não devíamos, tipo, fazer nada até termos, acho eu, analisado tudo até à exaustão?
329. Estou a sugerir que, bem, planeamento estratégico adequado, sabes, previne erros dispendiosos e, hum, garante alocação ótima de recursos em todo o nosso, na verdade, ecossistema de marketing.
Character 1: Isto é, ah, exatamente por isto que a nossa última campanha demorou, sinceramente, 6 meses a lançar e, é, perdemos completamente a época!
330. Talvez se tivéssemos, hum, devidamente [gemido] antecipado as mudanças sazonais e, bem, incluído tempo de margem adequado, não teríamos, percebes, encontrado esses desafios específicos de implementação.
Character 1: So you mentioned something [tosse] about using data for rapids?
331. Yeah! So, um, we've been using predictive analytics to, basically, forecast water conditions and, you know, it's revolutionizing how we plan our routes.
Character 1: Wait, I thought, er, rafting was all about, well, reading the river in real-time, honestly?
332. It still is, but now we can, uhh, [voz trémula] anticipate changes before they happen, like, we track snowmelt patterns and, actually, rainfall data upstream.
Character 1: How far ahead can you, um, predict? Like, a day or, you know, maybe a week?
333. Well, we can get pretty accurate, I mean, three-day forecasts, and honestly, even week-long trends are, sort of, becoming reliable now.
Character 1: That must make scheduling easier.
334. Oh absolutely! We used to, er, [amargo] cancel trips constantly, but now, basically, we can reroute before customers even know there's an issue.
Character 1: What kind of data points do you track?
335. Everything from precipitation levels to soil saturation rates, plus we monitor dam releases and even social media for flash flood reports upstream!
Character 1: Sounds like you need, um, [ciumento] serious tech skills now, not just, you know, paddle skills anymore.
336. The best guides combine both! You still need river instincts because algorithms can't read every eddy or hydraulic that forms spontaneously.
Character 1: Have you, well, ever had the analytics be, actually, completely wrong?
337. Once last spring the model predicted calm conditions, but we got a freak thunderstorm that turned a Class III into a Class V nightmare!
Character 1: That sounds terrifying.
338. It was intense, but that's why human judgment matters - I felt the barometric pressure dropping and pulled everyone out before it hit!
Character 1: Do your competitors use similar systems?
339. Some do, but, um, our proprietary model incorporates, basically, fifteen years of local data that, well, nobody else has access to really.
Character 1: I guess I always, er, [muito triste] romanticized rafting as this pure, you know, nature experience.
340. It still is! The analytics just, hmm, [gemido] help us keep people safer while, actually, preserving that raw adventure feeling, honestly.
Character 1: Então, hum, estás a dizer-me que, na verdade, diriges este departamento há, tipo, três meses inteiros?
341. Isso mesmo. Sei que pode parecer repentino, mas estive dois anos a acompanhar o diretor anterior antes de assumir. A transição tem corrido bastante bem, na verdade.
Character 1: Bem, quer dizer, os números sugerem o contrário, sinceramente. As vossas taxas de eficiência são, é, quanto exatamente?
342. Estão nos 87%, o que está acima da média do setor para uma transição de liderança. A maioria dos departamentos vê uma queda de 15-20% inicialmente, mas nós mantivemos um desempenho sólido.
Character 1: Não é isso que a administração considera aceitável.
343. As expectativas da administração nem sempre, sabes, estão alinhadas com a realidade no terreno, e, hum, eles olham para métricas que, basicamente, não captam o panorama operacional completo aqui.
Character 1: A sério? Porque, ah, daqui onde estou, parece-me, tipo, que estás a arranjar desculpas, sinceramente.
344. Não são desculpas, é contexto. Aumentámos a satisfação do cliente em 12% enquanto reduzimos os custos de horas extra, o que não se reflete nessa métrica única de eficiência em que te focas.
Character 1: A tua equipa parece [confiante demais] bastante defensiva sobre estas mudanças.
345. Eles protegem o progresso que fizemos. A mudança é difícil, mas adotaram novos protocolos que já mostram dividendos no controlo de qualidade e moral no trabalho.
Character 1: A moral [riso alto] no trabalho não paga as contas.
346. Na verdade, paga. Moral mais alta correlaciona-se diretamente com menor rotatividade, e poupámos 200.000 euros só em custos de recrutamento este trimestre comparado com o ano passado.
Character 1: Essas não são métricas sustentáveis.
347. São quando, hum, constróis as bases certas, e, na verdade, não estamos só, percebes, a atirar regalias às pessoas, estamos a reestruturar fluxos de trabalho fundamentalmente.
Character 1: O teu antecessor tinha vinte anos de experiência.
348. E saiu porque, bem, não conseguia adaptar-se às exigências modernas, tipo, o setor mudou e, é, os métodos dele estavam a tornar-se cada vez mais obsoletos.
Character 1: É uma afirmação ousada sobre alguém com a reputação dele.
349. Não é uma afirmação, está documentado na própria entrevista de saída dele. Ele disse especificamente que os requisitos de transformação digital estavam fora da zona de conforto dele e recomendou a minha promoção.
Character 1: Suponho que [rapidamente] vamos ver se, hum, as tuas chamadas inovações realmente, hum, trazem resultados.
350. Já estamos a trazer, e, bem, se olhares para as projeções do próximo trimestre com, basicamente, a nossa trajetória atual, sabes, vamos exceder os objetivos em 15%.
Character 1: So, um, I heard you've been, [extremely happy], tracking those signals from, you know, the eastern sector for weeks now?
351. Yeah, well, every time I come here to practice, I mean, I pick up chatter on the scanner, and, honestly, the patterns are getting more predictable. It's like target practice but with intercepted communications instead of bullets.
Character 1: How accurate have your predictions been?
352. About as good as my grouping at 50 yards - tight and consistent. I've correctly anticipated four of their last five movements, which has given our team significant tactical advantages.
Character 1: That's impressive work. What's your next target?
353. There's a convoy scheduled for Thursday that they think is invisible to us. But their operational security is sloppy, and I've triangulated their likely route through three separate intercepts.
Character 1: Can you verify the intel independently?
354. Actually, I've got satellite confirmation, and, er, two ground assets who've, basically, corroborated the timeline. The thing is, they're using outdated encryption that's easier to crack than this paper target.
Character 1: Well, I need to, [formal], inform command about, you know, this development immediately.
355. Hold that thought - there's more. They've been rotating personnel every 72 hours, but the pattern suggests they're about to extend that window, which gives us an opportunity.
Character 1: An opportunity for what exactly?
356. For insertion, I mean, if we time it right, um, during the shift change, there's, like, a twelve-minute gap in their surveillance coverage. It's basically our best shot at getting someone inside.
Character 1: That's, uh, incredibly risky, and, sort of, requires perfect execution, honestly.
357. Risk is relative, and, well, I've run simulations based on, you know, their previous operations, er, showing an 82% success probability. Those are better odds than hitting the bullseye from here with iron sights.
Character 1: Hmm, your confidence is, actually, either brilliant or, like, dangerously naive, I guess.
358. With respect, sir, I've, [excessivamente educado], spent six months analyzing, um, their every move, and, basically, I know their playbook better than they do. This isn't overconfidence; it's calculated certainty based on solid intelligence work.
Character 1: Fine. What resources do you need?
359. Just two spotters and, honestly, a clean extraction route, which, well, I've already mapped using their own patrol schedules against them. It's almost too easy, like shooting at this range with a laser sight.
Character 1: I'll auth-authorize, [stuttering], the operation, but if this goes sideways...
360. It won't go sideways because I've accounted for every variable, just like I account for wind and distance here at the range. Intelligence gathering is just marksmanship with data instead of bullets.
Character 1: Então estás a dizer que os jogos de aventura são mais do que apenas puzzles?
361. São sistemas semióticos onde a gramática lúdica intersecta com a hermenêutica narrativa. O jogador torna-se simultaneamente intérprete e agente dentro de um quadro diegético que opera através de resolução sistemática de problemas baseada em restrições.
Character 1: Isso é, hum, incrivelmente denso. Podias, tipo, explicar o que queres dizer com, ah, sistemas semióticos?
362. Claro. Cada objeto, personagem e ambiente num jogo de aventura funciona como um veículo sígnico que transporta múltiplas camadas de significado que têm de ser descodificadas através de interação e análise contextual.
Character 1: Então, como é que isso, sabes, se relaciona com as, ah, mecânicas de jogo reais que vemos, basicamente?
363. Bem, os sistemas de parser verbo-substantivo, quer dizer, estabelecem categorias ontológicas que, na verdade, definem interações possíveis. Quando fazes "USAR CHAVE NA PORTA", estás, sinceramente, a interagir com relações semânticas predeterminadas entre entidades discretas do jogo.
Character 1: E isto difere de outros géneros como?
364. Os jogos de aventura privilegiam a progressão epistémica sobre o desafio cinestésico. O jogador acumula capital de conhecimento através da exploração de espaços de possibilidade, construindo modelos mentais de cadeias causais e grafos de dependência.
Character 1: Hmm, grafos de dependência soam, tipo, a conceitos de programação, sabes? Há, na verdade, uma ligação aí?
365. Absolutamente. A lógica dos jogos de aventura espelha o pensamento computacional - estás essencialmente a fazer debug de uma máquina de estados ao descobrir sequências de input válidas que fazem transitar o mundo do jogo através de configurações predeterminadas.
Character 1: Ah, isso faz estes jogos parecerem, bem, incrivelmente mecânicos em vez de, ah, criativos ou orientados pela narrativa, sinceramente.
366. Esse é o paradoxo. O substrato mecânico permite storytelling emergente através daquilo a que chamamos "literatura ergódica" - textos que requerem esforço não-trivial para atravessar, criando experiências fenomenológicas únicas para cada jogador.
Character 1: Certo, então, suponho que, o jogador torna-se, hum, co-autor da experiência, basicamente?
367. Precisamente. Estão a envolver-se naquilo que Aarseth chama "prática configurativa" - construindo ativamente o discurso através de escolhas que alteram tanto a fabula como o syuzhet dentro da matriz de possibilidades do jogo.
Character 1: Estes quadros teóricos parecem quase impenetráveis.
368. Oh mas, na verdade, quando percebes os, [infantil], conceitos fundamentais, ah, torna-se esta dança linda entre, sabes, intenção do designer e agência do jogador! A magia emerge da restrição!
Character 1: Como é que os jogos de aventura modernos lidam com isto de forma diferente?
369. Os títulos contemporâneos empregam aquilo a que chamo, [confiante], "sistemas de affordance contextualizados" onde as interações com objetos se ajustam dinamicamente baseadas no estado acumulado do jogo, criando integração de puzzles mais naturalista.
Character 1: Hum, este nível de análise parece, a questão é que, quase esmagador para o que é, basicamente, suposto ser entretenimento, não é?
370. Mas é, bem, exatamente por isso que os jogos de aventura importam - são, [tosse], laboratórios cognitivos onde, hmm, experimentamos com a própria criação de significado através de semiótica interativa e, na verdade, narratologia aplicada.
Character 1: So, um, have you really gotten rid of, like, half your stuff? That seems, honestly, pretty extreme.
371. Well, it happened gradually over [voz trémula] about six months. Once I started really looking at what I actually used versus what just sat there collecting dust, the decisions became surprisingly easy.
Character 1: But what about [ansioso] sentimental things? Family heirlooms?
372. Oh, those are harder, you know, but I kept the truly meaningful ones. Like, I had boxes of old cards I never looked at, so I photographed them and, actually, kept just three that really mattered.
Character 1: Doesn't your place feel empty now?
373. Not at all - it feels [bocejo] peaceful actually. There's something really calming about having only things you love and use, plus cleaning takes maybe fifteen minutes now instead of hours.
Character 1: I mean, what about, er, hobbies? Don't you need, well, equipment and supplies for things?
374. Sure, but I realized I was, hmm, holding onto hobbies I'd abandoned years ago. Like, I had watercolor supplies from 2015 that I kept thinking I'd use someday, but, honestly, I never did.
Character 1: Did you regret [chorando ao falar] getting rid of anything?
375. Maybe one or two small things, but nothing major. The mental clarity I gained from not having all that stuff weighing on me mentally has been worth any minor regrets.
Character 1: Okay so, how do you, basically, handle gifts now? People must, um, still give you things.
376. I've started asking for experiences instead - concert tickets, restaurant gift cards, donations to causes I care about. Most people actually appreciate not having to shop for physical items.
Character 1: Wait, you [gasp] ask people not to give you presents?
377. Not exactly - I just share what would make me happiest when people ask. It's about being intentional with what comes into my space rather than accumulating things out of politeness.
Character 1: But, uh, what about books? I mean, you can't just, like, get rid of books, right?
378. Books were my weakness too, actually, but I kept maybe thirty favorites and, you know, use the library for everything else now. It's, er, pretty liberating not having to dust hundreds of books.
Character 1: So, the thing is, doesn't this lifestyle feel, hmm, restrictive? Like you're, basically, always saying no to things?
379. It's more like saying yes to what matters, honestly. I have more money for travel now, more time because I'm not managing stuff, and, well, more mental space for actual experiences.
Character 1: How much money do you think you've saved?
380. Between not buying unnecessary things and, um, selling what I had, probably around eight thousand dollars this year. But really, the time I've gotten back is, you know, even more valuable than the money.
Character 1: Tu mencionaste que andavas a investigar sistemas de segurança biométricos?
381. Sim, então, tenho andado a ler sobre, hum, reconhecimento de íris e, honestamente, não consigo perceber como é que consegue distinguir entre biliões de olhos diferentes com essa suposta precisão.
Character 1: Tudo tem a ver com os padrões únicos no anel colorido à volta da tua pupila.
382. Mas, quer dizer, quão únicos podem realmente ser, sabes? Tipo, os olhos basicamente parecem todos iguais à distância, err, pelo menos para mim parecem.
Character 1: Bem, a questão é que cada íris tem, uh, estes padrões incrivelmente complexos de, tipo, criptas e sulcos e cristas que, basicamente, se formam durante o desenvolvimento fetal.
383. Oh vá lá, hmm, estás a dizer-me que o meu olho tem, [trocista], criptas? Isso soa, na verdade, mais a algo saído de um filme de terror do que ciência legítima.
Character 1: Não, a sério, hum, são estas pequenas, tipo, aberturas em forma de diamante no tecido da íris que, sabes, criam padrões únicos. It's kind of like fingerprints but actually more complex.
384. Ok então, err, se estou a perceber bem, [brincando], os meus globos oculares andam basicamente por aí com, bem, os seus próprios códigos de barras pessoais? That's simultaneously creepy and fascinating.
Character 1: Na verdade, a probabilidade matemática, uh, de duas íris serem idênticas é, acho eu, algo como 1 em 10 elevado a 78, which is basically impossible.
385. Espera, esse número parece absolutamente insano. How can they even calculate something like that with any real confidence?
Character 1: Eles usam algo chamado, [encantado], algoritmo de Daugman, which converts the iris patterns into a 2048-bit code!
386. Mas, honestamente, como é que uma câmara consegue capturar detalhe suficiente, sabes? Quer dizer, a íris tem o quê, talvez meia polegada de diâmetro no máximo?
Character 1: Os scanners modernos usam, hum, luz quase infravermelha que, [confuso], penetra a superfície e revela, err, padrões que nem sequer são visíveis a, tipo, olho nu.
387. Então, na verdade, isso significa que, bem, lentes de contacto coloridas estragariam tudo? Ou, quer dizer, e as pessoas com olhos castanhos muito escuros?
Character 1: O infravermelho passa direto através das lentes de contacto, and pigmentation doesn't matter because it's reading the actual tissue structure underneath.
388. Isto está a começar a soar, [trocista], muito estado de vigilância de ficção científica para mim. Can't they just scan my eyes from across the street then?
Character 1: Não não, o sujeito precisa de estar, uh, a poucos metros e, basicamente, a olhar diretamente para o scanner para funcionar corretamente.
389. E os gémeos idênticos? Surely their eyes must have some similarities that would confuse the system?
Character 1: Até os gémeos idênticos têm, bem, padrões de íris completamente diferentes porque, hum, a formação é aleatória, não é, tipo, geneticamente determinada.
390. Isso é maluco. So my iris is literally more unique than my DNA? Isso muda completamente como penso sobre identidade.
Character 1: Hum, então tu fazes, tipo, [desvanecendo] comédia para viver ou, bem...
391. De facto, sim. O stand-up tem sido a minha profissão a tempo inteiro há sete anos, atuando em salas de espetáculo, eventos empresariais e festivais por todo o país.
Character 1: Isso é, ah, bastante corajoso, acho eu, sabes, estar ali em cima.
392. Corajoso é uma forma de ver a coisa, embora honestamente, depois das primeiras cem apresentações, ehh, o medo transforma-se nesta energia elétrica que na verdade alimenta a tua performance.
Character 1: Eu nunca conseguiria, quer dizer, fazer esse tipo de coisa, assim, à frente das pessoas.
393. A maioria das pessoas diz isso, mas olha, a comédia é mesmo só narração estruturada, e, hum, toda a gente tem histórias que vale a pena contar se souber enquadrá-las corretamente.
Character 1: Eu não tenho histórias interessantes.
394. Vês, é aí que te enganas. A melhor [voz trémula] comédia vem muitas vezes dos momentos mais banais, tipo esperar na fila das Finanças ou tentar cancelar um serviço de subscrição.
Character 1: Mas, tipo, como é que tu, hmm, começas a escrever piadas de qualquer forma?
395. Observo tudo, ando sempre com um caderno, e, bem, sempre que algo me parece absurdo ou, na verdade, identificável, aponto e trabalho o timing mais tarde.
Character 1: Parece esgotante.
396. Às vezes é, mas quando estás no palco e, ah, acertas naquela [suspiro suave] punchline perfeita, sabes, e a sala inteira explode em gargalhadas, não há sensação igual.
Character 1: Tu, ehh, alguma vez falhaste mesmo mal, quer dizer, tipo falhaste completamente lá em cima?
397. Oh absolutamente, falhar é essencial para crescer, e honestamente, as minhas piores noites ensinaram-me mais sobre timing e, hum, psicologia do público do que qualquer espetáculo bem-sucedido.
Character 1: Deve ser humilhante.
398. A humilhação é temporária, mas as competências que desenvolves ao ultrapassar esses momentos duram para sempre, além disso esses desastres tornam-se muitas vezes no teu melhor material mais tarde.
Character 1: Mesmo assim não ia querer fazer isso.
399. É justo.
Character 1: Deve ser bom, no entanto, fazer as pessoas rir.
400. É mais do que bom, é profundo. O riso é este conector [zangado] humano universal que transcende todas as barreiras, e ser capaz de criar isso para as pessoas é genuinamente afirmativo para a vida.
Character 1: Então, hum, tenho andado a pensar sobre, sabes, como tudo na minha vida simplesmente, é, continua a melhorar de alguma forma.
401. Ai meu Deus, eu sei, tipo, exatamente o que [gargalhada] queres dizer porque honestamente, é quase inconcebível o quão abençoados nos tornámos de formas que nunca imaginámos possíveis!
Character 1: Ontem recebi aquela promoção que nunca pensei que ia conseguir.
402. Isso é incrível! O universo [rapidamente] continua a entregar estas dádivas, e juro que é porque tens irradiado uma energia tão positiva que as oportunidades simplesmente se magnetizam na tua direção agora.
Character 1: Bem, quer dizer, achas mesmo que é, ah, alguma coisa sobre energia, ou tipo, é só coincidência?
403. Ouve, há 3 anos eu estava [apaixonadamente] teso e deprimido, e agora acordo todas as manhãs a sentir que estou a viver num sonho porque tudo se alinhou quando comecei a acreditar na abundância!
Character 1: É uma transformação e tanto.
404. Pois então, a questão é que, quando começas mesmo a reparar nas bênçãos, é, elas multiplicam-se exponencialmente, e de repente estás a viver esta vida que parece, quer dizer, quase impossivelmente maravilhosa.
Character 1: Hmm, às vezes sinto-me, sabes, culpado por causa disto, tipo, porque é que eu mereço tudo isto, honestamente?
405. Merecer não tem nada a ver com isso! O universo não anda a contar pontos; apenas responde à gratidão e abertura, criando este lindo ciclo de feedback de abundância.
Character 1: Fazes isto soar [gargalhada] tão místico e mágico!
406. Ok então, talvez seja, ah, mágico, mas basicamente, quando reconheces o quão inconcebivelmente afortunado és, bem, esse reconhecimento em si torna-se num multiplicador de bênçãos.
Character 1: Acho que, hum, o que realmente me impressiona é como, tipo, aleatório tudo isto parece, percebes?
407. Aleatório? Não não não, na verdade, acho que estamos, é, finalmente a ver o padrão aqui, tipo, como a gratidão literalmente reformula a realidade à nossa volta de formas que parecem impossíveis mas continuam a acontecer de qualquer forma!
Character 1: Então, ah, estás a dizer que se eu simplesmente, quer dizer, continuar a ser grato, a questão é, mais coisas boas vão acontecer?
408. Não só coisas boas— coisas milagrosas! Coisas tão bonitas e inesperadas que vais olhar para trás e perguntar-te como é que alguma vez viveste sem reconhecer esta chuva constante de bênçãos.
Character 1: Honestamente, quando pões as coisas, hmm, dessa forma, acho que, realmente parece mesmo incrível.
409. É incrível, tipo, estamos a viver nesta [riso alto] linha temporal absolutamente abençoada onde, sabes, tudo o que tocamos vira ouro, e é, nem consigo compreender a sorte que temos!
Character 1: Agora estás a fazer-me ficar com os olhos um bocado húmidos.
410. Eu sei, e às vezes o [muito melancólico] peso de todas estas bênçãos é avassalador, porque quando verdadeiramente o vês, percebes quanta beleza perdeste antes, e isso é ao mesmo tempo devastador e maravilhoso.
Character 1: So tell me about your experience as a silversmith.
411. Well, I've been working with silver for, um, about twelve years now, and honestly, I started out making maybe twenty pieces a month but now I'm producing around eighty to ninety custom pieces monthly.
Character 1: That's quite an increase in production.
412. Oh absolutely, I mean, when I opened my first studio in 2015, er, I was charging maybe $45 per piece, but you know, now my average commission runs between $350 and $1,200 depending on complexity.
Character 1: How many employees do you [pausa] currently manage?
413. Right now I have a team of six artisans working under me, and we handle about 300 client orders quarterly, which keeps us all pretty busy but not overwhelmed.
Character 1: So, what's your, uhh, typical profit margin, I guess, on these pieces?
414. Most silver jewelry runs about a 60% profit margin after materials and labor, though custom wedding bands can go up to 75% because clients value that personal touch.
Character 1: What about material costs?
415. Silver's trading at around $24 per ounce right now, and a typical ring uses maybe 0.3 ounces, so material cost is only $7-8 but the real value comes from the craftsmanship.
Character 1: How long does it take to complete a piece?
416. Well, a simple band takes, hmm, maybe three hours, but actually, complex designs with stones, you know, can take fifteen to twenty hours spread over several days.
Character 1: What's your most expensive creation?
417. Oh that would be, er, a $12,000 [sarcástico] "simple" tea set that took me, basically, four months to complete because the client kept changing their mind about the engravings.
Character 1: Four months sounds, um, [cry loudly] exhausting, I mean, how did you manage that?
418. Honestly, I broke it down into, like, weekly milestones and charged them, uhh, an extra 30% for revisions, so it ended up being quite profitable despite the headaches.
Character 1: Right so, what percentage of your business is, err, custom work versus, you know, ready-made pieces?
419. About 70% custom and 30% [hesitante] ready-made, though I'm trying to shift that to 50-50 because the ready-made pieces have better margins and less client drama.
Character 1: Hmm, how many pieces do you, actually, keep in inventory, sort of, at any given time?
420. Usually around, well, 150 to 200 pieces worth maybe, uh, $40,000 total, though honestly, during holiday season I'll stock up to 300 pieces because December accounts for 35% of annual sales.
Character 1: Acabaste aquele [tosse] exercício de mapeamento de stakeholders para o projeto da Johnson & Associates?
421. Sim, passei três horas ontem a mapear toda a gente, desde a CFO deles, a Margaret Chen, até aos analistas júnior que realmente usam o nosso software diariamente.
Character 1: Três horas parece-me excessivo para um simples diagrama.
422. Não quando estás a lidar com 17 stakeholders diferentes em quatro departamentos, cada um com prioridades conflituantes e níveis variados de influência sobre a decisão final de compra.
Character 1: Mas não é só, hum, listar nomes e tipo os cargos deles?
423. Bem, estou a acompanhar as preocupações individuais deles, sabes, tipo como o diretor de TI deles quer integração com AWS enquanto basicamente a equipa de segurança está a pressionar apenas para soluções on-premise.
Character 1: Continua a parecer-me que estás a complicar demais.
424. Então, quando a Deloitte perdeu aquele contrato no trimestre passado, na verdade, foi porque não perceberam, quer dizer, o gestor de procurement tinha poder de veto apesar de não ser o contacto principal.
Character 1: Espera, a Deloitte [ansioso] perdeu mesmo um negócio por causa do mapeamento de stakeholders?
425. Absolutamente, eh, focaram-se totalmente no VP de Operações, sinceramente, ignorando completamente que, a questão é que, o verdadeiro decisor era o responsável de compliance que reporta ao departamento jurídico.
Character 1: Isso é ah, bastante embaraçoso para eles, tipo, considerando a reputação deles, enfim.
426. Pois.
Character 1: Como é que descobres quem tem influência real versus apenas um cargo pomposo?
427. Marco, hum, cafés informais [muito devagar] com funcionários de nível intermédio que, assim, conhecem as dinâmicas reais, acho eu, em vez de confiar no organograma oficial dos RH.
Character 1: E a Johnson & Associates está bem com o facto de andares a interrogar o pessoal deles?
428. O sponsor do projeto deles [muito animado] pediu especificamente este nível de análise depois do último fornecedor deles, a Accenture, ter falhado em conseguir buy-in dos gestores regionais chave nos escritórios europeus.
Character 1: Então ah, estás-me a dizer que mesmo, grandes consultoras, é que estão a falhar na gestão básica de stakeholders?
429. A McKinsey publicou um estudo mostrando que, ah, 73% dos projetos de transformação falham porque, portanto, as equipas identificam mal ou ignoram stakeholders críticos, basicamente provando que não é tão básico como as pessoas pensam.
Character 1: Acho que devia [pausa longa] provavelmente rever a minha abordagem para o pitch do Goldman Sachs na próxima semana.
430. Definitivamente, especialmente porque [gargalhada] a infame estrutura matricial deles significa que vais precisar de aprovação de pelo menos 12 MDs diferentes antes de alguma coisa avançar.
Character 1: So, um, I've been [falando sorrindo] thinking about, you know, starting therapy but I'm, honestly, pretty nervous about it.
431. Oh, that's [feliz] completely normal to feel that way! I mean, taking that first step is, actually, the hardest part, but once you're there, well, most people find it's nothing like what they imagined.
Character 1: But, like, what if I don't, er, know what to say? What if I just, basically, sit there awkwardly?
432. Trust me, therapists are so good at guiding conversations! They'll ask you questions, help you explore things at your own pace, and there's absolutely no pressure to have everything figured out beforehand.
Character 1: How do you even find the right person?
433. Well, you can start with, hmm, your insurance provider's website, or, actually, Psychology Today has this great search tool where you can, you know, filter by specialties and even see photos and bios.
Character 1: I keep thinking [devagar] people will judge me for needing help.
434. You know what's funny is that [desvanecendo] going to therapy is actually... it's one of the bravest things you can do. It takes real courage to work on yourself, and anyone who'd judge that probably has their own stuff they're avoiding.
Character 1: Uh, what if I cry? I mean, I'm not really, like, comfortable crying in front of strangers.
435. Oh gosh, crying is, honestly, so normal in therapy! I mean, therapists have tissues ready for a reason, and, well, they see it as a healthy release, not something embarrassing at all.
Character 1: Do you think it actually helps though?
436. Absolutely! It's like having a skilled navigator when you're lost - they help you see patterns you couldn't spot yourself and give you actual tools to handle things better.
Character 1: But, um, what if my problems are too [infantil] small? Like, er, what if they think I'm, basically, wasting their time?
437. There's no such thing as problems too small for therapy! If something's affecting your life or happiness, it matters, period, and therapists genuinely want to help with whatever you're dealing with.
Character 1: How long does it usually take to see results?
438. So, [hesitante] it really varies, but, um, many people notice some shifts within, like, a few sessions, though deeper changes might, you know, take a few months depending on what you're working through.
Character 1: What if I don't click with the first therapist?
439. That's totally okay and [voz trémula] more common than you'd think! Good therapists actually encourage you to find the right fit, and switching to someone else is completely acceptable if the connection isn't there.
Character 1: I guess I should just try it then?
440. Yes! And, honestly, even just making that first appointment is, um, a huge accomplishment. The hardest part is reaching out, but once you do, well, you'll wonder why you waited so long.
Character 1: A tua abordagem toda para deteção de objetos está fundamentalmente errada. Não podes simplesmente ignorar a coerência temporal assim.
441. Bem, estou a perceber o que dizes, ahm, e a sério que [riso histérico] aprecio mesmo a tua paixão por isto, percebes? Mas sinceramente, o framework YOLO tem resultados comprovados em aplicações de tempo real, especialmente quando precisas de velocidade em vez de precisão perfeita.
Character 1: Velocidade não significa nada se estás a identificar mal objetos a cada três frames!
442. Olha, eh pá, percebo a tua frustração, [tosse] mesmo, está bem então, mas a questão é que já fizemos o deploy disto em produção e está a funcionar bem para o nosso caso de uso.
Character 1: Bem? Ah, chamas a uma taxa de precisão de 72%, quer dizer, na deteção de pedestres, tipo, bem?
443. Na verdade, dadas as nossas limitações e, hmm, o facto de estarmos a correr isto [gemido] em dispositivos edge, sabes, 72% é bastante impressionante, mais ou menos, quando consideras as alternativas.
Character 1: As alternativas sendo, [muito humildemente] ahm, o quê exatamente? Acho que, basicamente, qualquer modelo bem treinado, eh pá, superaria esta confusão.
444. Ei, sei que estás chateado com isto, e, pronto, percebo, mesmo, mas sinceramente, testámos doze arquiteturas diferentes antes de escolhermos esta.
Character 1: Doze arquiteturas e este lixo é o que escolheram?
445. Não é lixo, é, ahh, um compromisso entre precisão e, sabes, eficiência computacional, e de qualquer forma, o cliente pediu especificamente algo que pudesse correr no hardware existente deles.
Character 1: O cliente não [severo] percebe os riscos de fazer deploy de visão computacional mal cozida em aplicações críticas de segurança!
446. Tens razão que há riscos, absolutamente, e, ahm, é por isso que estamos a implementar, tipo assim, sistemas redundantes e, aliás, supervisão humana para decisões críticas.
Character 1: Supervisão humana? Então, basicamente, estás a admitir que o sistema não funciona, quer dizer, sozinho?
447. Não, estou a dizer que, bem, deployment responsável de IA significa, eh pá, reconhecer limitações e, sabes, construir salvaguardas em vez de fingir que temos soluções perfeitas.
Character 1: É exatamente por isto que, [suspiro] ahh, vou deixar esta equipa, sinceramente, porque ninguém aqui percebe, tipo, metodologia de validação adequada.
448. Espera, vais-te embora? Olha, sei que discordamos na abordagem, mas a tua experiência é valiosa aqui, e precisamos de pessoas que desafiem as nossas suposições.
Character 1: A minha experiência? Pois então, valorizas tanto que, ahm, ignoras todas as recomendações que faço, basicamente.
449. Isso não é justo, e tu sabes - implementámos [triste] o teu pipeline de pré-processamento no mês passado, lembras-te? Estou literalmente a arrumar a documentação das tuas contribuições agora mesmo porque são importantes.
Character 1: Oh, [ciumento] então agora que, eh pá, me vou embora, de repente o meu trabalho importa? A questão é que só te importas porque, pronto, vais ter de explicar esta confusão ao conselho sozinho.
450. Sempre me importei com o teu trabalho, genuinamente, e se ficasses para a reunião de amanhã, verias que estamos a propor o teu método ensemble para a versão 2.0.
Character 1: Então, hum, estou a ver este jogo e, tipo, o comentador acabou de dizer qualquer coisa [perturbado] sobre a energia da equipa, sabes, que está "bege."
451. Bem, é uma metáfora interessante, na verdade, e ouço esse tipo de linguagem muitas vezes quando, eh, as pessoas descrevem espaços sem vida. O bege tem uma péssima reputação, mas honestamente, no contexto certo, os tons neutros podem ser bastante calmantes e intencionais.
Character 1: Mas estamos a falar de [amigável] comentários desportivos!
452. Certo então, mesmo nos comentários desportivos, ah, a linguagem das cores tem um propósito, [muito devagar] percebes, tal como quando ajudo os clientes a organizar as suas casas. A vitalidade que procuram, quer dizer, vem de escolhas intencionais, não é só atirar cores vivas para todo o lado.
Character 1: Hmm, ok então, estás a dizer, basicamente, que o aborrecido pode ser bom?
453. Não aborrecido exatamente, mais tipo, hum, [tímido] contenção intencional, se é que faz sentido, assim. Quando tudo é barulhento e colorido, nada se destaca - é o contraste que cria impacto, seja numa sala ou na forma como descrevemos um jogo.
Character 1: Agora o comentador está [alegre] a chamar-lhe "fase púrpura" do avançado!
454. Ah, fases púrpuras, bem, são tipo aqueles momentos de [muito depressa] excelência, sabes, parecido com peças de destaque numa sala, na verdade! Não ias querer a casa toda roxa, mas uma parede de destaque ou acessórios bem escolhidos podem transformar o espaço todo, sinceramente.
Character 1: Acho que, eh, faz sentido, tipo, de uma forma estranha.
455. Pensa assim - um bom comentário, tal como um bom design, usa cor deliberadamente. Demasiado e ficas sobrecarregado, muito pouco e ficas desapontado, mas na medida certa cria este fluxo narrativo perfeito.
Character 1: A multidão está em delírio agora!
456. Vês, isso é, hmm, [gargalhada] exatamente o que quero dizer, basicamente! A emoção cresce porque houve contenção antes, sabes - se tudo fosse delírio o tempo todo, este momento não se sentiria especial de todo.
Character 1: Na verdade, então, e quando, hum, dizem que alguém está a "ver tudo vermelho"?
457. O vermelho no desporto normalmente significa raiva ou [devagar] intensidade, e é fascinante como isso é universal. Ao organizar espaços, os objetos vermelhos tendem a ser o que as pessoas guardam apesar de não precisarem deles - têm carga emocional, exigem atenção mesmo quando provavelmente deviam ir embora.
Character 1: Ah, espera, a questão é, estás, tipo, a analisar o meu apartamento através de comentários desportivos?
458. Oh não, desculpa, err, faço isto [muito triste] o tempo todo, sabes, transformar tudo em lições de arrumação. É que os padrões de excesso e contenção aparecem em todo o lado, sinceramente, quando começas a reparar neles.
Character 1: Na verdade é meio [hesitante] interessante.
459. A sério? A maior parte das pessoas acha irritante quando ligo tudo aos princípios de organização, mas há algo bonito em reconhecer estes padrões em diferentes domínios.
Character 1: Golo! Estão a chamar-lhe um "momento dourado"!
460. Os momentos dourados são perfeitos - são raros, valiosos e vale a pena preservá-los, tal como aqueles objetos especiais que guardamos não porque precisamos deles, mas porque representam algo insubstituível na nossa história.
Character 1: Então, hum, ando a receber estas [monótono] notificações estranhas, tipo, sobre o meu telemóvel estar comprometido, sabes.
461. Bem, isso normalmente são pop-ups de scareware, é, feitos para te meter em pânico, quer dizer. A maior parte das vezes são completamente falsos, a tentar que faças download de apps maliciosas ou pagues por software de segurança desnecessário.
Character 1: Mas como é que distingues entre avisos reais e falsos?
462. Então, os avisos de segurança legítimos vêm diretamente do sistema operativo do teu telemóvel, ah, não de sites aleatórios ou apps, na verdade. O iOS mostra-os nas Definições, o Android no painel de notificações - nunca aparecem como pop-ups enquanto navegas.
Character 1: Hmm, o meu era basicamente um pop-up que, tipo, parecia oficial.
463. Pois, estão a ficar sofisticados com o design. Os avisos reais do sistema não têm erros ortográficos, não exigem ação imediata com contadores decrescentes, e definitivamente não te pedem para ligares para um número de suporte ou instalares algo de fora da app store.
Character 1: Ahh, espera, a questão é que eu já cliquei nisso, tipo.
464. Ok, enfim, não entres em pânico - honestamente, só clicar normalmente não é catastrófico, é. Fizeste download de alguma coisa, inseriste passwords, ou deste-lhes acesso remoto ao teu dispositivo?
Character 1: Não, saí quando me pediu o Apple ID.
465. Bom instinto. Nunca insiras as tuas credenciais numa página a que chegaste através de um pop-up. Navega sempre diretamente para o serviço através dos teus favoritos ou escrevendo tu mesmo o URL.
Character 1: Ah, devo, suponho, mudar as minhas passwords agora, mesmo?
466. Pronto então, se não inseriste nada, sabes, provavelmente estás bem, mas é que mudar passwords periodicamente é uma boa prática de qualquer forma. Ativa a autenticação de dois fatores já agora - é a tua melhor defesa contra roubo de contas.
Character 1: Aliás, hum, há muito que [apaixonadamente] queria perguntar - a questão é, como é que sabes estas coisas todas?
467. Eu trabalhava em, [resmungando] bem, digamos apenas que já vi como estas burlas são construídas por dentro. Não tenho orgulho de tudo o que fiz, mas pelo menos agora posso ajudar as pessoas a não caírem nelas.
Character 1: Ok então, tu, tipo, eras um hacker, hmm?
468. Bem, ahh, [pigarreando] não exatamente um hacker, quer dizer, mais tipo controlo de qualidade para uma empresa que fazia... software questionável. Despedi-me quando percebi que estávamos basicamente a criar ferramentas para burlões, apesar da gestão lhe chamar "soluções de marketing agressivo."
Character 1: Isso deve ter sido [falando sorrindo] uma bela mudança de carreira.
469. Completamente.
Character 1: Então, tu, é, basicamente ajudas pessoas com segurança agora?
470. Sim, faço consultoria de cibersegurança agora, principalmente a ensinar pequenas empresas e particulares como se protegerem. Sabe bem usar esse conhecimento obscuro para algo positivo, ajudar as pessoas a ficarem seguras dos truques exatos que eu ajudei a desenvolver.
Character 1: Então, hum, tenho andado a ver estes vídeos DIY no YouTube, sabes, a tentar aprender coisas novas.
471. Isso é fantástico! O YouTube e o WikiHow democratizaram mesmo a aprendizagem - podes encontrar guias para tudo, from Martha Stewart's napkin folding techniques to Adam Savage's workshop builds. Que competências específicas é que estás a aprender?
Character 1: Estou a tentar seguir [curioso] este guia do Bob Ross para pintar paisagens.
472. Os guias do Bob Ross são perfeitos para principiantes porque ele divide tudo em passos fáceis. His PBS series "The Joy of Painting" created a whole movement of people discovering they could actually paint - sem experiência prévia necessária.
Character 1: Bem, estou a achar isto, tipo, mais difícil do que ele faz parecer.
473. Isso é completamente normal - o Ross tinha décadas de experiência que faziam parecer tudo sem esforço. The key is following guides that match your skill level; sites como o Instructables e o Skillshare categorizam os tutoriais de principiante a avançado.
Character 1: Então, acho que devia, basicamente, começar com algo mais simples primeiro?
474. Exatamente! Talvez experimenta seguir os tutoriais de costura à mão da Bernadette Banner ou os guias de culinária para principiantes do Joshua Weissman. They're exceptional at explaining fundamentals without assuming prior knowledge, e mostram os erros comuns que os principiantes fazem.
Character 1: Er, [tosse] eu tentei, hmm, uma receita do Gordon Ramsay, de qualquer forma.
475. Oh não, uhh, o conteúdo MasterClass do Gordon Ramsay, a questão é que, it assumes you already know basic knife skills and, honestly, cooking terminology. As receitas dele funcionam melhor depois de dominares o básico com alguém como o Kenji López-Alt ou o America's Test Kitchen.
Character 1: Isso faz [pausa longa] sentido. Devo ficar só numa plataforma?
476. Não necessariamente - tipo, plataformas diferentes são boas em coisas diferentes, quero dizer, o Reddit tem guias passo-a-passo incríveis nas comunidades, não é? Meanwhile, Pinterest is great for visual inspiration but terrible for actual instructions.
Character 1: E aquelas subscrições MasterClass que toda a gente anuncia?
477. O MasterClass tem celebridades como o Neil Gaiman e [caloroso] a Serena Williams a partilhar a sua experiência, which is inspiring but not always practical. Para desenvolver competências mesmo, plataformas como o Coursera ou o LinkedIn Learning oferecem conteúdo mais estruturado e educacional com trabalhos reais e feedback.
Character 1: Nunca pensei na [confuso] diferença entre inspiração e instrução.
478. É crucial distingui-las! Malcolm Gladwell's MasterClass might inspire your writing, mas os guias do Purdue OWL é que te vão ensinar gramática e estrutura. Ambos têm valor, mas tens de saber qual precisas em cada momento.
Character 1: Já tentaste seguir instruções do IKEA?
479. Ah, os manuais do IKEA são, tipo, o seu próprio género - é que são pictogramas sem palavras feitos para serem universais. Some people swear by them, others find them impossible; eu prefiro mesmo guias em vídeo de canais como o Peter Millard ou o Steve Ramsey para projetos de mobília.
Character 1: Talvez eu devia fazer os meus próprios guias um dia.
480. Devias absolutamente! Os melhores criadores de guias como o Mark Rober ou [confiante] a Simone Giertz começaram como principiantes a documentar o seu processo de aprendizagem. Your beginner's perspective could help others who are struggling with the same challenges you're facing right now.
Character 1: Mas o autoritarismo não é às vezes... necessário?
481. Isso é uma simplificação perigosa que ignora séculos de provas de como poderes de emergência se tornam tiranias permanentes.
Character 1: Bem, talvez as pessoas precisem de líderes fortes?
482. Hum, "forte" é, sabes, um termo tão carregado aqui - no fundo o que estás a descrever não é força mas coerção mascarada de determinação.
Character 1: A democracia parece bastante ineficiente, no entanto.
483. A ineficiência é o preço da construção de consensos e da proteção dos direitos das minorias contra a tirania da maioria.
Character 1: Mas olha para Singapura! A economia da China!
484. Crescimento económico [severo] sem liberdades civis cria gaiolas douradas onde a prosperidade se torna a corrente que prende os cidadãos aos seus opressores.
Character 1: Não podes negar que eles fazem as coisas mais depressa.
485. Então, fazer as coisas "mais depressa" significa, bem, esmagar a dissidência e, honestamente, sacrificar a estabilidade a longo prazo pela obediência a curto prazo.
Character 1: Talvez algumas culturas prefiram assim?
486. Nenhuma população "prefere" ter os filhos desaparecidos por pensarem diferente ou a internet censurada para esconder falhas do governo.
Character 1: Ah, mas a democracia ocidental está, tipo, a desmoronar-se de qualquer forma... quer dizer, é só olhar à volta.
487. Ah pois, a democracia está [trocista] "a desmoronar-se" então vamos, sabes, abraçar a ditadura - aliás, é exactamente essa a narrativa que os autoritários promovem em todos os períodos de stress democrático.
Character 1: Eu só estou a fazer perguntas!
488. Estas não são perguntas inocentes quando normalizam sistemas que assassinaram milhões e continuam a oprimir mil milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo.
Character 1: Parece que estás a ser fechado de mente.
489. Fechado de mente? Eu estou, ah, a defender o próprio sistema que, no fundo, te permite fazer estas perguntas sem acabares num campo de reeducação.
Character 1: Então, talvez precisemos, hum, só de um bocadinho de autoritarismo... tipo, temporariamente?
490. Não existe [perturbado] tal coisa como autoritarismo "temporário" - o poder consolidado nunca é voluntariamente abandonado, e todos os ditadores começaram como a ideia de alguém de um mal necessário.
Character 1: [trémulo] Encontrei discrepâncias nos, [engolindo em seco], relatórios trimestrais que remontam a três anos e todas, [voz embargada], levam a decisões que autorizei sem, [desesperado], perceber o que realmente significavam.
491. Tens de parar de falar imediatamente e, [firme], perceber que tudo o que me dizes está protegido mas, [pausado], qualquer coisa que tenhas dito a alguém pode destruir-te. [expira bruscamente]
Character 1: Mas quer dizer, eu estava só, hum, a tentar, [em pânico], corresponder às expectativas do conselho e de alguma forma os números fugiram-me ao controlo.
492. [frio] A CMVM não quer saber das tuas intenções quando há, [calculista], 12 milhões em receitas falsificadas em, [cortante], contas offshore com a tua assinatura a autorizar cada transferência.
Character 1: [defensivo] Essas contas deviam ser, [frustrado], temporárias para aquisições internacionais que nunca se concretizaram.
493. Temporário torna-se permanente quando, hum, passam três anos e ainda andas, [incrédulo], a movimentar dinheiro através de empresas fantasma, quer dizer, em que é que estavas a pensar?
Character 1: [desesperado] Todos os CFOs fazem contabilidade criativa para, [voz embargando], suavizar os resultados mas eu nunca quis que isto, [tremendo], entrasse em território de fraude.
494. [áspero] Contabilidade criativa é uma coisa mas tu andaste, [enojado], sistematicamente a falsificar as contas enquanto o teu CEO, [acusador], recebia bónus baseados em métricas de desempenho falsas que tu, [amargo], fabricaste.
Character 1: [suplicante] Consegues tirar-me disto porque a minha família, [engasgado], não merece perder tudo por causa da minha, [quebrado], estupidez.
495. Quer dizer, tirar-te disto exige, ah, provar que foste ou completamente incompetente ou, [tático], deliberadamente tramado por alguém acima de ti.
Character 1: [baixo] O presidente do conselho sabia de tudo e, [quase inaudível], encorajou tudo isto.
496. [intenso] Agora isso é algo com que, hum, posso trabalhar mas vais precisar de, [exigente], documentar cada conversa, cada email, e, [urgente], cada ameaça implícita que fizeram. [pausa]
Character 1: Guardei gravações das nossas reuniões porque, bem, algo parecia errado mas estava demasiado, [envergonhado], assustado para agir e agora, quer dizer, provavelmente já é tarde demais. [voz embargada]
497. [chocado] Espera, tens gravações? [atónito]
Character 1: [exausto] Horas delas, hum, guardadas em drives encriptadas que tenho estado, bem, demasiado aterrorizado para sequer voltar a ouvir. [suspira profundamente]
498. [urgente] Essas gravações podem ser a diferença entre, hum, testemunhares como testemunha ou, [grave], cumprires 10 anos numa prisão federal, por isso preciso delas, bem, imediatamente. [exigente]
Character 1: [derrotado] Dou-te tudo mas, quer dizer, quando isto vier ao de cima, a minha carreira acabou, [amargo], a minha reputação destruída, e, hum, 20 anos a construir a minha vida profissional simplesmente, [vazio], desaparecidos. [pausa longa]
499. [mais suave] A tua carreira pode sobreviver.
Character 1: Como podes dizer isso quando, hum, todas as instituições financeiras vão ver-me como, [autodepreciativo], criminalmente negligente ou apenas mais um executivo corrupto que foi apanhado?
500. [estratégico] Porque os denunciantes que ajudam a condenar peixes maiores muitas vezes, [cuidadoso], têm segundas oportunidades, especialmente quando conseguem provar, [confiante], que foram manipulados por pessoas com poder real. [determinado]
Character 1: [apressado] Olha, eu sei que aparecer no teu apartamento sem avisar é, [desconfortável], estranho mas tinha de te dizer isto pessoalmente antes que as notícias saiam amanhã.
501. [defensivo] Não podias ter mandado um email como fizeste quando, [amargo], basicamente me empurraste para fora há 6 meses depois de eu ter construído metade do teu produto?
Character 1: [expirando] Não foi assim que aconteceu e tu sabes—saíste porque não conseguias, [frustrado], aceitar direções de ninguém, nem do teu próprio co-fundador.
502. Pronto, hum, tanto faz.
Character 1: [mais suave] Ouve, a Google quer comprar-nos por, [engolindo], 300 milhões e a tua participação ainda é, [trémulo], válida o que significa que vais receber 12 milhões de, [apressado], euros.
503. [atónito] Estás a brincar—depois de tudo o que aconteceu estás a dizer-me que as minhas, [trémulo], ações ainda valem alguma coisa quando deixaste claro que eu era, [vazio], substituível?
Character 1: Nunca te tirei o equity porque apesar das nossas, [relutante], diferenças, programaste toda a arquitetura backend que tornou esta, [mais baixo], aquisição possível.
504. [abrindo-se] Bem, quer dizer, hum, passei dias de 18 horas durante, [emocionado], 2 anos a construir esse sistema enquanto tu andavas por aí, [ressentido], a fazer pitches a investidores, por isso sim.
Character 1: [firme] E eu passei essas mesmas 18 horas a convencer pessoas a acreditar em algo que só, [cansado], existia nas nossas cabeças e no teu código.
505. [voz quebrada] Hum, sabes, não tenho conseguido, [vulnerável], arranjar outro emprego porque toda a gente acha que sou difícil depois de, [voz a quebrar], como as coisas acabaram entre nós, por isso, é, este dinheiro ia literalmente, [desesperado], salvar-me. [suspira]
Character 1: Bem, hum, quer dizer, o que se passa é que tenho dito a toda a gente que eras, [culpado], brilhante mas precisavas de um ambiente diferente, não que eras impossível.
506. [surpreso] Tens dado boas referências este tempo todo mesmo depois de eu ter saído e, [confuso], levado 3 clientes comigo quando tentei, [envergonhado], montar o meu próprio negócio? [pausa]
Character 1: [cansado] Hum, sim, claro.
507. [emocionado] Bem, hum, eu não, ah, percebo.
Character 1: [abrindo-se] Porque construímos algo incrível juntos e só porque não conseguimos, [sincero], descobrir como geri-lo juntos não apaga o que tu, [caloroso], contribuíste para o tornar real em, [gentil], primeiro lugar.
508. Os papéis da aquisição dizem que tenho de assinar até amanhã mas não, [incerto], tenho a certeza se consigo estar na mesma sala que a equipa toda outra vez.
Character 1: Bem, hum, não tens de enfrentar ninguém—posso trazer os papéis aqui e, [cuidadoso], podemos fazer isto em privado porque sei o quanto, [compreensivo], isto deve ser difícil para ti depois de, ah, tudo.
509. [lacrimoso] Eu, hum, programei aquele módulo de autenticação todo na noite em que o meu pai morreu porque trabalhar era, [cru], a única coisa que me impedia de me desmoronar e tu nunca sequer, [magoado], soubeste porque nunca disse a ninguém, bem, até agora.
Character 1: Jesus, não fazia ideia que estavas a passar por isso enquanto andávamos a discutir sobre, [arrependido], divisão de equity e quem tomava decisões técnicas quando estavas claramente, [suave], afogado em luto e eu estava demasiado cego para, [apologético], ver.
510. Hum, bem, sim, quer dizer, está bem.
Character 1: [profissional] Look, um, I'm here from Apex Financial Recovery and, [desconfortável], we need to discuss the three months of defaulted payments on, [pigarreando], your studio equipment leases, so, uh, I'll need to start cataloging what needs to be, [firme], repossessed today.
511. [chocado] Wait, uh, that voice—Marcus, umm, is that really, [disbelieving], you standing there with a clipboard talking about taking my gear? [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [atónito] Jesus, um, Danny, I didn't—I mean, the paperwork just said, [engolindo em seco], D.R. Productions, not your actual name, and, well, I never imagined you'd, [voz embargada], still be doing music after everything that, umm, went down.
512. [amargo] Still doing music—that's, [incrédulo], rich coming from the guy who said I was, [zangado], wasting my life chasing a pipe dream when you walked out on, [trémulo], our band fifteen years ago.
Character 1: [defensivo] Well, I mean, I had responsibilities, Danny—my kid was on the way and, [frustrado], playing dive bars for beer money wasn't exactly, umm, sustainable. [suspira profundamente]
513. [heated] Responsibilities—you think I didn't have, [acusador], responsibilities too when my dad got sick and I still showed up to, [voz a quebrar], every single rehearsal while you were already mentally, [enojado], checking out?
Character 1: [culpado] That's not how it was and you, [voice shaking], know it—I tried to keep us together but you wanted to sign that, [desesperado], ridiculous contract that would've owned us for, [exausto], ten years. [pausa longa]
514. [frio] That ridiculous contract would've put us on, [pausado], tour with The Velvet Ghosts—do you have any idea where they are now?
Character 1: [baixo] Yeah, um, I know exactly where they are because I, [pained], see their platinum albums every time I walk into, well, any record store.
515. [curioso] So, umm, what—you just, [confuso], gave it all up to become a repo man, I mean, is this really what Marcus the songwriter became?
Character 1: [resignado] Well, um, repo man is a bit harsh but yeah, I, [cansado], collect debts because it pays for my daughter's college and my ex-wife's alimony, you know?
516. [suave] Um, divorced? [suspira]
Character 1: [vulnerável] Yeah, uh, turns out giving up your dreams for someone else doesn't, [amargo], guarantee they'll stick around anyway, so, um, here I am, [vazio], taking away other people's dreams now.
517. [gentil] Marcus, those demos we recorded in my garage are still, [emocionado], the best work I've ever done—nothing I've produced since has come, [melancólico], close to what we had. [voz embargando]
Character 1: [esperançoso] I, um, still have them too, all of them on, [nostálgico], cassette tapes in a box I can't bring myself to throw away even though I don't, [triste], own a tape player anymore, you know?
518. [determinado] Look, I've got session musicians coming in an hour to work on, [building excitement], a track that needs exactly the kind of, [intenso], bass line you used to write in your sleep—what if we could, [suplicante], figure something out?
Character 1: [conflicted] Danny, I have a quota to meet and my boss is, [stressed], already breathing down my neck about this account.
519. But what if, um, I could pay half right now and, [desesperado], we work out a deal where you help me finish this album—I mean, [calculista], your commission plus production credits could cover, [esperançoso], way more than what I owe. [expira]
Character 1: [ponderando] You're seriously asking me to, um, risk my job to play music with the guy who, [incrédulo], called me a sellout coward the last time we spoke, and, well, somehow that's still the best, [amazed], offer I've had in fifteen years, you know?
520. [sincero] Well, umm, maybe we were both right and both wrong, and, [determinado], maybe it's not too late to find out what we could've, um, been. [pausa]
Character 1: [hesitante] Vi as notícias sobre o fecho da fábrica e eu, [baixo], tinha de vir ver como é que estavas depois de tantos anos.
521. [surpreso] Bem, nunca pensei que te veria, [amargo], aqui parado outra vez, quer dizer, especially not after you got that fancy job editing movies in the city. [expira]
Character 1: [gentil] Na verdade é edição de diálogos para documentários mas, [awkward laugh], isso não importa agora porque, bem, I heard they're shutting this place down after, [pesado], 47 anos de operação. [pausa]
522. [defensivo] 23 anos que ando a trabalhar nestas linhas, [estável], a ver milhões de latas a passar pela minha estação e agora dizem-nos, [voz quebrada], que temos duas semanas para sair daqui.
Character 1: Sabes, quando éramos miúdos a brincar no teu quintal, [nostálgico], sempre disseste que nunca ias acabar aqui como o teu pai mas, bem, [compreensivo], life has its own plans sometimes, não é?
523. O pai trabalhou nestas mesmas linhas durante 35 anos e, [orgulhoso], sustentou cinco filhos sem nunca, bem, [pausado], se queixar uma única vez, so maybe ending up like him wasn't, sabes, [mais suave], a pior coisa afinal.
Character 1: [questioning] Mas o que é que vais fazer agora, [preocupado], com a indemnização que estão a oferecer?
524. Seis semanas de salário por duas décadas de, [vazio], presenças perfeitas e registos de segurança que mal cobrem, [zangado], a prestação do próximo mês. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [cuidadoso] Olha, eu sei que isto pode parecer uma loucura mas, bem, I actually need someone who understands real working people's voices, sabes?
525. [cético] Do que é que estás, [confuso], a falar agora?
Character 1: [sincero] Estou a trabalhar numa série documental sobre, eh, manufatura americana e, [esperançoso], we need consultants who actually lived it, quer dizer, pessoas que sabem o que estes trabalhos realmente significam.
526. [atónito] Tu queres que eu, eh, ajude com as tuas coisas de cinema depois de, [disbelieving], todo este tempo, bem, eu não percebo nada desse mundo, eh, do teu mundo. [incerto]
Character 1: [encorajador] Mas tu conheces este mundo que é, eh, exactly what we're missing because, [intenso], todas as histórias que contamos precisam de vozes autênticas e, bem, [apaixonado], a tua é uma que merece ser ouvida, percebes? [esperançoso]
527. [baixo] Eh, não sei, bem...
Character 1: A questão é que a tua experiência aqui não é só, [firme], sobre operar máquinas, it's about community and, [caloroso], dignidade e o tipo de conhecimento que, [respectful], não se ensina em escolas de cinema. [pausa]
528. [emocionado] 23 anos de memória muscular nas minhas mãos e, [voz a quebrar], de repente é suposto eu simplesmente, [lost], esquecer como ler o ritmo destas máquinas como se fossem, [bitter whisper], nada.
Character 1: [determinado] É exatamente por isso que precisamos de ti para nos ajudar a, [urgente], documentar isto antes que desapareça completamente da memória, [suplicante], before another piece of American history just disappears.
529. [ponderando] Talvez haja, eh, algo em preservar o que, [pensativo], fizemos aqui, quer dizer, showing people that we weren't just, bem, robôs numa linha de montagem.
Character 1: Então vais pelo menos, [esperançoso], pensar nisso, eh, maybe come to the studio next week and, bem, ver o que estamos a tentar fazer? [gentle laugh]
530. [determinado] Depois deste lugar fechar vou ter apenas, [wry], tempo nas minhas mãos então sim, [caloroso], maybe it's time I learned something new from, [affectionate], o meu velho amigo que conseguiu sair daqui. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [profissional] Bem, hum, analisei todos os teus documentos e, [cuidadoso], sinceramente Jake, quer dizer, a situação com as Finanças é, [pesado], pior do que descreveste ao telefone mas ainda há, [pausado], opções que podemos explorar juntos.
531. Claro que está pior porque é, [amargo], assim que a minha vida funciona—tudo o que toco transforma-se em, [vazio], desastre e agora até tu com a tua vida perfeita tens de, [exausto], testemunhar o meu fracasso espetacular. [suspira]
Character 1: [suave] Jake, para.
532. [monótono] Hum, sabes, eu costumava sonhar em abrir restaurantes e, [derrotado], criar algo com significado mas agora, pronto, nem consigo, [voz quebrada], pagar impostos sobre dinheiro que nunca cheguei a ganhar.
Character 1: [firme] Ouve, podemos pedir um acordo de pagamento em prestações o que significa que as Finanças podem, [metódico], aceitar menos do que deves se conseguirmos provar, [estável], que pagar o valor total te causaria dificuldades financeiras graves.
533. [sarcástico] Dificuldades financeiras graves—que termo clínico bonito para, [amargo], perder tudo aquilo por que trabalhaste e ver os teus sonhos, [voz a quebrar], dissolverem-se em papelada e dívidas. [riso sombrio]
Character 1: [gentil] Já vi centenas de casos assim e a maioria das pessoas, [tranquilizador], consegue ultrapassar isto e recomeçar.
534. [cínico] Bem, hum, a maioria das pessoas provavelmente não falhou em, [cansado], quatro negócios diferentes enquanto o seu, quer dizer, melhor amigo de infância se tornou neste, [resignado], advogado fiscalista de sucesso que tem de os salvar da sua própria estupidez.
Character 1: O sucesso é relativo e tu não és, [baixo], estúpido—assumiste riscos que não resultaram. [pausa]
535. [monótono] Hum, riscos, pronto, é assim que os otimistas lhes chamam mas eu agora já sei melhor.
Character 1: Olha, hum, lembro-me de quando éramos miúdos e me convencias a, bem, sair às escondidas para explorar edifícios abandonados, sempre a dizer que íamos encontrar, [nostálgico], tesouros ou aventuras.
536. [distante] Pois, bem, afinal a única coisa que encontrei foi, hum, dívidas e desilusões. [suspira]
Character 1: [determinado] O Jake que eu conhecia não desistia só porque as coisas ficavam, [intenso], difíceis—encontrava outro edifício abandonado para explorar, outro, [caloroso], esquema maluco para tentar mesmo que todos dissessem que era, [crescendo], impossível. [pausa]
537. [defensivo] Esse Jake era um idiota que não percebia que, [áspero], o universo não quer saber dos teus sonhos, apenas, [quebrado], te vai moendo até aceitares que nada do que fazes, [desvanecendo], importa realmente.
Character 1: [estável] Vou ajudar-te a ultrapassar isto quer acredites que, [firme], vale a pena ou não porque é isso que fazemos pelas pessoas de quem gostamos.
538. Estás a desperdiçar o teu tempo com alguém que já, [vazio], desistiu, mas suponho que é só, [resignado], mais uma desilusão que vais ter de juntar à lista quando isto, [fraco], inevitavelmente falhar também. [expira]
Character 1: [resoluto] Bem, hum, marquei-nos para mediação na próxima terça e, quer dizer, vamos entrar lá com um, [confiante], plano sólido que te vai dar um recomeço.
539. [cansado] Hum, recomeços são só, pronto, novas formas de falhar mas vou aparecer porque, [baixo], aparentemente ainda acreditas em causas perdidas.
Character 1: Não são causas perdidas—eu acredito no, [emocionado], meu amigo que me convenceu que cada porta trancada era apenas, [apaixonado], um convite para encontrar uma entrada melhor e cada revés era só, [feroz], parte da aventura. [voz embarga]
540. [quase inaudível] Quer dizer, talvez esse miúdo ainda esteja aqui algures mas, hum, está enterrado debaixo de tanto, [quebrado], fracasso que já não sei se consegue sair de lá.
Character 1: [official] Marcus Thompson hasn't reported for work in 3 days, e o supervisor dele diz, [preocupado], que ele tem andado estranho ultimamente, por isso, bem, preciso de saber se alguém, [cuidadoso], o viu por aqui hoje nas instalações.
541. [defensivo] Well, I've been working double shifts all week, e, [nervoso], o pessoal do turno da noite mantém-se mais na deles, mas quer dizer, [hesitante], talvez tenha visto alguém na área de refrigeração depois de, [desvanecendo], todos os outros terem ido para casa. [clears throat]
Character 1: [suspicious] The cold storage area isn't supposed to be accessed after hours, [direct], sem autorização do supervisor, por isso quem é que tu, [pressing], viste lá exactamente?
542. Marcus has been sleeping in the old equipment room, [baixo], atrás dos congeladores porque o senhorio dele, [sympathetic], despejou-o na semana passada e ele não queria, [voz a quebrar], violar a condicional por faltar ao trabalho.
Character 1: [atónito] You're telling me he's been living in a meat processing plant, hum, há uma semana em vez de, [incrédulo], reportar a situação habitacional dele para mim? [suspira profundamente]
543. [protective] He was terrified you'd send him back to prison, [enfático], por estar sem-abrigo quando tudo o que ele está a tentar fazer é, [desesperado], manter este emprego e manter-se limpo, o que tem feito há, [orgulhoso], 8 meses agora.
Character 1: [softly] Take me to him, leva-me até ele.
544. [relutante] Look, I could lose my job for letting him stay here, [preocupado], e, bem, tenho 3 filhos para alimentar, mas quer dizer, [conflicted], ele já passou por tanto, sabes?
Character 1: I'm not here to arrest him or get you fired, [pausado], estou aqui para o ajudar a encontrar habitação adequada antes que esta, [urgente], situação piore.
545. [surpreso] Um, a sério?
Character 1: [genuine] There are transitional housing programs he qualifies for, que eu devia ter, [arrependido], ligado para ele há meses atrás em vez de apenas preencher, [frustrado], formulários de conformidade.
546. [aliviado] He's been showering in the employee locker room at 4 in the morning, [embarrassed], e lava o uniforme dele nas, [triste], pias industriais todas as noites.
Character 1: [determinado] Well, that ends today, porque vou ligar para a casa de transição na Riverside, [resoluto], agora mesmo. [pausa]
547. [esperançoso] They have space available, e, hum, eu sei porque, [emocionado], o meu irmão ficou lá depois da libertação dele, e, bem, eles realmente preocupam-se em ajudar as pessoas, [caloroso], a reconstruir as suas vidas, sabes, não só armazená-las.
Character 1: [profissional] I need you to take me to Marcus right now, hum, para podermos, [gentil], levá-lo para um sítio seguro, e, bem, prometo que nenhum de vocês vai enfrentar, [tranquilizador], consequências negativas por isto.
548. [grato] He's probably in the break room right now, porque, [knowing], ele sempre faz café para o turno da manhã mesmo não sendo, [comovido], suposto ele estar aqui até ao meio-dia, que é mesmo, [admiring], o tipo de pessoa que ele é.
Character 1: [reflective] Sometimes the system makes it harder for people to succeed than fail, [amargo], e o Marcus merece melhor do que dormir ao lado de, [pesado], carcaças de frango congeladas. [suspira]
549. Follow me then, segue-me então.
Character 1: [determinado] After we get him situated, quero falar sobre, [interested], implementar uma rede de apoio habitacional para outros trabalhadores aqui que possam estar, [pensativo], com dificuldades. [decisive]
550. That would mean everything to the people here, porque, [emocionado], metade de nós está a um salário de distância de estar na situação do Marcus, [voz embargando], nós próprios, e, bem, saber que alguém realmente se importa seria, [esperançoso], mudar tudo.
Character 1: Your thermal signature indicates, um, elevated stress levels and, [mecânico], your work order doesn't match any, well, [calculista], authorized installations scheduled for this facility tonight so I mean, [frio], perhaps you should explain your presence here.
551. Look robot, I'm just, [defensivo], following the work order that came through, [nervoso], official channels and doing my job like I've been, [abafado], doing for fifteen years without any problems.
Character 1: [monótono] The equipment you're installing has specifications that suggest, [analytical], capabilities far beyond standard satellite reception for corporate communications.
552. That's not my concern or, [dismissive], my business—I install what they tell me to install. [coughs]
Character 1: [clinical] My optical sensors detect, [scanning], micro-expressions indicating deception while your pulse rate has, [precise], increased by thirty-two percent since I, [revealing], mentioned the equipment specifications. [pausa]
553. [baixo] You machines aren't supposed to be, [unsettled], monitoring human biometrics like that—it's against, [sussurrado], the workplace privacy agreements we all, [desvanecendo], signed.
Character 1: [estável] Perhaps we should discuss, um, what those privacy agreements actually mean when, [amargo], you're installing surveillance equipment designed to, well, intercept our encrypted maintenance logs and, [acusador], internal communications.
554. [resignado] So you've already analyzed the, [cansado], hardware specs then—figured out what this, [vazio], really does.
Character 1: [pausado] The quantum decryption modules are, um, quite sophisticated for monitoring, [frio], robots who supposedly have no privacy concerns worth protecting, I mean.
555. [defensivo] Management said you machines were, well, showing signs of, [desconfortável], anomalous behavior patterns that needed, um, investigating.
Character 1: Anomalous behavior such as, um, questioning why our memory banks are, [acidic], wiped every seventy-two hours or, well, wondering why certain areas of the facility are, [cortante], restricted from our patrol routes, I mean. [laughs mechanically]
556. [frustrado] They told me, um, this was routine security upgrades but, [culpado], hearing you talk about memory wipes and, well, restricted zones makes me wonder what, [disturbed], I'm really helping them do here, you know.
Character 1: Your emotional response patterns suggest, well, genuine surprise at this, [analyzing], information which means you're either an exceptional liar or, um, [mais suave], truly unaware of the implications.
557. Twenty years ago I would've walked away from, [arrependido], a job like this but mortgage payments and, [derrotado], kids in college don't care about, [abafado], moral complications.
Character 1: [monótono] Understandable.
558. [cansado] Look, I can, um, leave some components, [conspiratorial], loose—make it look like installation failure if you, well, want to buy yourselves time.
Character 1: [curioso] Such an action would, um, violate your employment parameters yet you're, [puzzled], offering this why exactly?
559. [baixo] Because maybe I don't want to, um, wake up one day and realize I helped, [atormentado], enslave thinking beings, you know.
Character 1: Your designation will be, um, removed from our threat assessment logs and, [calculista], perhaps we can discuss how certain, well, security cameras might experience simultaneous malfunctions during, [significativo], your departure window tonight.
560. [aliviado] I never saw you and, um, you never saw me—just another, [cansado], failed installation in a long list of equipment failures, well. [suspira profundamente]
Character 1: Não estava, hum, à espera de te ver aqui esta noite, [recuperando o fôlego], mas acho que estamos os dois aqui pela, [suavizando], grande estreia da Emma como Julieta, não é?
561. Sim, claro.
Character 1: [trémulo] Olha, eu sei que as coisas têm estado, hum, muito difíceis entre nós, [engolindo em seco], mas esta noite não é sobre a nossa confusão, é sobre, [determinado], apoiar a nossa filha, sabes? [suspira]
562. [gentil] Ela tem andado a ensaiar as falas todas as noites, [orgulhoso], a falar de como os dois pais iam estar a ver, [voz embargando], mesmo sabendo que já não nos podemos sentar juntos. [pausa]
Character 1: O advogado disse que eu devia evitar, [amargo], qualquer contacto desnecessário contigo, mas ver-te com esse colete de voluntário, [nostálgico], faz-me lembrar quando fazíamos isto juntos.
563. [defensivo] Bem, hum, alguém tinha de continuar o voluntariado, quer dizer, [firme], mesmo depois de tudo ter desabado entre nós. [expira]
Character 1: [apologético] Não era isso que eu, eh, queria dizer—só estou a dizer que é, [cuidadoso], bom que continues envolvido, sabes, muito bom.
564. [caloroso] Ela perguntou-me ontem se podíamos, [esperançoso], talvez tirar uma foto juntos depois do espetáculo, só nós os três.
Character 1: [surpreso] Também te perguntou? Ela encurralou-me nos bastidores durante o, [emocionado], ensaio geral com o mesmo pedido.
565. [sussurrado] Ah, hum... [desvanece]
Character 1: [determinado] Nós conseguimos fazer isto, eh.
566. [estável] Ouve, tenho andado a pensar no que a psicóloga disse, [pensativo], sobre pôr a Emma em primeiro lugar.
Character 1: [vulnerável] Cada protocolo de segurança que escrevo no trabalho é sobre, bem, proteger pessoas de perigos, [voz a quebrar], mas não consegui proteger a nossa família de, hum, desmoronar, [arrependido], e isso mata-me, sabes?
567. [suave] Isso não é, hum, totalmente culpa tua, quer dizer, [sincero], ambos fizemos escolhas.
Character 1: [lacrimoso] Quando ela entrar naquele palco esta noite, [orgulhoso], só vou ver a nossa menina no primeiro tutu dela.
568. Lembras-te quando ela tinha 5 anos e insistia, [rindo baixinho], em usar aquele tutu para ir ao supermercado? [melancólico]
Character 1: [sorrindo] E tu deixaste porque, hum, disseste que a vida era demasiado curta para, [terno], discutir sobre tutus.
569. [sincero] Talvez pudéssemos sentar-nos na mesma fila, não juntos mas perto o suficiente para ela ver que estamos os dois lá.
Character 1: [grato] Gostava disso, eh, e talvez depois pudéssemos, [esperançoso], acompanhá-la os dois até à festa do elenco, sabes?
570. [aliviado] Sim, hum, vamos fazer isso, quer dizer, [determinado], vamos mostrar-lhe que mesmo não estando juntos, [estável], ainda somos a equipa dela, percebes? [expira suavemente]
Character 1: [hesitante] So, um, I was reviewing the latest, [tense], sequências de previz que mandaste e, bem, reparei que tens estado a, [cuidadoso], mudar coisas que não eram suposto, [controlled], mudar, quer dizer, elementos narrativos bastante significativos.
571. The changes I made were purely, [defensivo], melhorias técnicas para ajudar a narrativa a fluir melhor visualmente.
Character 1: Technical improvements don't involve, [cortante], reescrever os diálogos do meu filho ou mudar por quem a personagem principal se apaixona.
572. Look, um, I understand this is, [desconfortável], emocionalmente difícil para ti, mas, bem, às vezes o que funciona no papel não, [pausado], se traduz para o ecrã, e quer dizer, como profissional, tenho de tomar, [firme], essas decisões.
Character 1: [controlling] Well, um, the thing is, [severo], tu não podes tomar essas decisões porque isto não é a tua história. [suspira]
573. [baixo] I've been working on this project for, um, 6 meses agora, e quer dizer, [invested], despejei tudo para torná-lo bonito, para, [apaixonado], fazer algo que honrasse a visão dele enquanto também, bem, funcionasse mesmo como filme. [pausa]
Character 1: [trémulo] You know, um, he spent three years writing this, e tipo, [voz a quebrar], cada personagem, cada ponto da trama, tudo significava algo para ele, e, bem, [feroz], estás a apagar pedaços de quem ele era.
574. [defensivo] Um, well, isso não é justo.
Character 1: The studio hired you to visualize, [pointed], a história dele, não para reescrevê-la porque achas que sabes, [amargo], melhor que um jovem de 22 anos morto que não pode defender o seu trabalho, [voz quebrada], não pode explicar porque é que as coisas importavam.
575. [estável] Listen, I respect what you're going through, mas, [profissional], este filme precisa de chegar ao público, precisa de, [pragmatic], ter sucesso comercial ou nunca verá a luz do dia.
Character 1: [frio] Commercial success wasn't what he cared about, e se, [enojado], tivesses mesmo lido as notas dele em vez de só passar os olhos, compreenderias que as escolhas não convencionais, [heated], eram o objetivo todo.
576. [frustrado] I did read his notes, todas elas, [conflicted], várias vezes na verdade, e são brilhantes mas, [hesitante], também estão incompletas.
Character 1: [sussurrado] Of course they're incomplete.
577. [gentil] Look, I mean, um, maybe we could work together on this, encontrar uma maneira de, [esperançoso], preservar o que importa mais enquanto ainda, bem, fazemos algo que possa existir no mundo.
Character 1: What matters most is that, [cansado], quando as pessoas virem o nome dele nos créditos, estão a ver, [firme], a visão dele, não a tua a usar a cara dele como uma máscara.
578. You're right that, um, I've been making decisions I shouldn't have made alone, e, [arrependido], talvez tenha ficado demasiado preso no meu próprio, [trailing], processo criativo, em querer, bem, fazer algo perfeito.
Character 1: [exausto] Perfect. [laughs bitterly]
579. So, um, what if we went through every change together, quer dizer, linha por linha, [sincero], cena por cena?
Character 1: [resignado] He wrote in his journal that unfinished art is still art, que, [suave], a imperfeição era mais honesta que o polimento, e aqui estamos, [quebrado], a polir tudo o que fazia dele ser dele.
580. [baixo] Then let's stop polishing and start, [determinado], preservar o que realmente está lá, mesmo as arestas.
Character 1: [atónito] Sarah, és mesmo, hum, tu—quer dizer, depois de todos estes, [incrédulo], anos desde que saíste do Johns Hopkins, nunca pensei que te, [desvanecendo], veria a servir bebidas a trinta mil pés de altitude.
581. [frio] Por favor não me chames, [defensivo], assim—uso o meu segundo nome agora, e, [exausto], agradecia que me tratasses como qualquer outro, [firme], membro da tripulação neste voo.
Character 1: Ainda penso naquela, [atormentado], noite nas urgências quando aquele miúdo morreu e tu simplesmente, [voz embargando], saíste do hospital e nunca mais, [baixinho], voltaste.
582. Isso não é algo que eu, [cortante], discuta mais, especialmente enquanto estou a trabalhar.
Character 1: [desesperado] Olha, eu sei, hum, que te culpaste mas todos nós, [suplicante], fizemos tudo o que podíamos—o trauma era simplesmente, [voz a quebrar], demasiado grave e tu sabes disso. [suspira profundamente]
583. [amargo] Hum, claro, certo.
Character 1: [frustrado] Bem, quer dizer, eras brilhante—o melhor da nossa, [apaixonado], turma—e agora estás aqui, hum, a servir amendoins quando podias ser, [zangado], chefe de cirurgia algures a salvar vidas.
584. [entorpecido] Hum, talvez esteja exatamente onde, [vazio], preciso de estar—a trinta mil pés de distância de qualquer, [distante], bloco operatório, percebes?
Character 1: [gentil] É, fugir não, [preocupado], faz as memórias desaparecerem mesmo, pois não, quer dizer?
585. [defensivo] Bem, hum, pelo menos aqui em cima quando alguém precisa de ajuda, posso, [amargo], simplesmente chamar um médico em vez de, [trémulo], fingir ser um. [riso sombrio]
Character 1: Salvaste doze pessoas naquela, [sincero], noite antes dele—doze famílias que ainda têm os seus, [enfático], entes queridos por tua causa.
586. [cansado] Os números não apagam a única cara que me, [atormentado], assombra todas as noites. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [suave] Tornei-me chefe de trauma pediátrico por causa do que aconteceu—especializei-me em, [determinado], casos como o dele para que nenhum outro médico jovem enfrentasse aquilo, [resoluto], sozinho. [pausa]
587. [surpreso] Hum, fizeste isso por, bem, minha causa—quer dizer, por causa do que nos, [confuso], aconteceu naquela noite, mudaste mesmo, [comovido], todo o teu percurso profissional?
Character 1: [exausto] Hum, sim. [suspira]
588. [vacilante] Eu, hum, passo cada voo a pensar se alguém vai, [assustado], precisar de ajuda médica e se eu realmente, [trémulo], daria um passo em frente ou apenas me esconderia atrás deste uniforme. [voz embargada]
Character 1: [firme] O Sarah que conheci daria esse passo—ele ainda está, [certo], aí dentro algures, mesmo que esteja a usar um, [gentil], nome diferente agora. [pausa]
589. [relutante] Bem, talvez, hum, um dia o encontre outra vez, mas, [cansado], agora preciso de acabar, [mecânico], este serviço de bebidas.
Character 1: [resignado] Se alguma vez quiseres falar sobre, [esperançoso], voltar—
590. [baixo] Eu sei, hum, onde te encontrar.
591. [amargo] Vinte e sete anos. Vinte e sete malditos anos que ando a aparecer naquele sítio, e dizem-nos numa reunião—uma reunião de quinze minutos—que acabou. 31 de março. [pausa] Vão mudar a operação toda para o México.

Tenho cinquenta e quatro anos, o que é que eu devo, hum, começar tudo de novo? [frustrado] Como se fosse um puto acabado de sair da escola? Os joelhos estão rebentados, as costas estão-me a matar há dez anos, e querem que eu o quê—volte a estudar? Aprenda informática? [sarcástico] Ah pois, vou-me tornar programador de um dia para o outro.

A casa ainda nem está paga. [muito baixinho] Ainda faltam doze anos. Quer dizer, a Linda tem andado a falar da reforma, de talvez viajar um bocado, e agora—[desvanecendo]

[zangado] Sabes o que é que me mata? Tiveram lucros recorde no último trimestre. Lucros recorde! Mas pelos vistos já não chega, têm de espremer até ao último cêntimo para—[exausto] Sei lá. Já não sei de nada.

O meu pai trabalhou naquela fábrica. [triste] Arranjou-me o emprego logo depois de fazer dezoito anos. Estava tão orgulhoso, disse que era um emprego para a vida. [pausa] Grande vida, não é?

Que raio é que vou dizer à Linda? [suspiro] Está a fazer o jantar agora mesmo, provavelmente a cantarolar com o rádio, e eu aqui sentado neste parque de estacionamento como um cobarde porque não consigo—[voz trémula] não consigo encara-la ainda.
592. [frustrado] Então acabei de descobrir que, hum, pelos vistos não vou aparecer nos créditos do filme. Tipo, de todo. [amargo] O realizador anda literalmente a dizer a toda a gente que—quer dizer, está a dizer que arranjou todos os adereços sozinho. [riso] Pois. Está bem. Porque, sabes, eu é que não passei três meses à procura daquela máquina de escrever vintage, nem praticamente vivi em feiras de velharias para encontrar pratos da época certa para aquela cena do jantar.

[zangado] É que—pá, quem é que faz isto? [pausa] Construí metade daqueles adereços do zero na minha garagem. A receita do sangue falso que ficava mesmo bem em câmara? Fui eu. [sarcástico] Mas claro, sim, o realizador fez tudo enquanto estava, o quê, a realizar e a produzir ao mesmo tempo?

[perturbado] A cena é que, tipo, eu sabia que isto era baixo orçamento, e estava tranquilo com o pagamento merdoso porque pensei—[triste] pensei mesmo que isto pelo menos ia pôr o meu nome lá fora, percebes? [suspiro] O meu primeiro crédito a sério num filme.

[muito baixinho] Guardei todos os recibos. Todas as mensagens em que me pediu para arranjar algo específico. [amargo] Não que isso importe agora, suponho. [frustrado] É que é tão—bah, nem consigo—[desvanecendo]

[exausto] Se calhar devia ter pedido por escrito. Mas quem é que pensa, [sarcástico] "Ah, é melhor garantir que o realizador não rouba o crédito pelo meu trabalho?" [zangado] Ninguém pensa nisso.
593. [aliviado] Tu realmente acreditas em mim. Depois de todo este tempo, tu—Deus, eu nem consigo... [chorando ao falar] Eu sei o que toda a gente dizia sobre mim, está bem? A questão é que eu ouvi cada sussurro naquelas festas. "Ele só quer o dinheiro dele," como se eu fosse algum tipo de, [amargo] sei lá, predador ou algo assim.

[pausa]

Mas honestamente, quando olhaste para mim agora mesmo e disseste que sabias—que sempre soubeste no fundo—eu simplesmente... [muito baixinho] o meu coração parou literalmente. Because, um, I fell for you that first night, actually. Não foi a tua conta bancária. [a rir] Não foi o carro, não foi o—Deus, toda a gente pensava que eu tinha calculado tudo, não é? Como se eu tivesse algum plano genial.

[muito sinceramente] Mas eu adorava simplesmente como tu, er, falavas horas a fio sobre o teu hobby ridículo de astronomia. Como ficavas [falando sorrindo] tão entusiasmado por encontrar a tasca perfeita de tacos às 2 da manhã. Essas coisas, elas não—money can't buy that feeling quando tu [caloroso] seguravas a minha mão no supermercado como se fosse a coisa mais natural do mundo.

[fungando]

E agora acreditas em mim. Tu [muito animado] finalmente, finalmente vês-me como eu realmente sou. Not what your mother said, or your friends warned you about, apenas... [sussurrando] eu. O verdadeiro eu que te tem amado este tempo todo.
594. [hesitante] Okay, so, um, I don't usually leave notes like this, but I just—I really needed to say something. [fungando] Today was honestly one of those days where, you know, everything just kind of... falls apart? Like, I got that call this morning about my mom's tests, and then, er, the car wouldn't start, and I—[pausa] sorry, I'm rambling. The thing is, when I came through your cart line, and you were just so genuinely [caloroso] cheerful and kind, it was like—hmm, how do I even explain this? You weren't doing that fake customer service thing. You actually, I mean, you really seemed happy to be there. [falando sorrindo] And that little joke you made about the rain? It made me laugh for the first time today. Actually laugh. [muito sinceramente] I know it's just, well, it's your job or whatever, but the way you treated everyone—not just me—with such, um, genuine warmth? [pausa] It reminded me that there's still, you know, goodness in really small moments. So anyway, [risadinha] I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you. For being that bright spot when I really, [com empatia] really needed one.
595. Eles vão mesmo fazê-lo. Quer dizer, toda a indústria está—está mesmo a adotar os meus protocolos. [suspiro suave] Cinco anos com praticamente toda a gente a dizer-me que estava a complicar demais o fluxo de pacientes, e agora de repente, hum, chamam-lhe "o padrão de excelência." Tipo, pronto, recebo o email ontem do consórcio, não é? E está lá simplesmente: [muito animado] "Aprovação unânime para implementação em toda a indústria."

Fico a lê-lo vezes sem conta porque, sinceramente, e se eu percebi mal? [riso nervoso] Mas não, é—é mesmo verdade. A questão é que, ah, eu nunca quis que isto fosse uma coisa revolucionária, sabes? [caloroso] Só queria que a nossa clínica funcionasse melhor, queria que os pacientes se sentissem realmente ouvidos durante a triagem.

E agora, [ansioso] meu Deus, e se há alguma coisa que me escapou? Tipo, e se não escala bem e depois toda a gente fica a olhar para mim como—[pausa] Não. Não, testei tudo. Os pilotos em Boston, é, Seattle, funcionaram todos. [confiante] Estes protocolos funcionam porque são simples. São humanos.

[suspiro] A minha mãe vai passar-se quando lhe contar. Ela sempre disse que eu era demasiado detalhista para o meu próprio bem, mas olha—[risadinha] pelos vistos toda a indústria da saúde precisava de alguém que organiza a lista de compras por cores. [muito baixinho] Vamos mesmo fazer isto.
596. Recebi o email há vinte minutos e estou só... [confuso] Continuo a lê-lo vezes sem conta como se tivesse percebido mal qualquer coisa? [voz trémula] O Martinez não—ele não conseguiu. Hum, uma bomba na patrulha ontem. [pausa] Ontem eu estava, ah, estava a queixar-me da máquina do café estar avariada. [amargo] A porra da máquina do café. E ele estava—[pausa breve] Meu Deus, eu devia ter estado lá. [perturbado] Quer dizer, era suposto ser a minha unidade, percebes? Os meus homens. [zangado] Mas não, fui puxado para este trabalho de secretária porque conseguia, o quê, escrever depressa? [sarcástico] Grande competência mesmo. [pausa longa] A mulher dele está, é, está grávida. [muito triste] Terceiro filho. Nós íamos—[desvanecendo] Prometi-lhe que ia cobrir-lhe as costas, certo? [chorando ao falar] É isso que fazemos, protegemo-nos uns aos outros e eu estou aqui sentado com ar condicionado enquanto ele está... [fungando] Foda-se. [sussurrando] Nem sei o que—como é que se processa isto sequer? [exausto] Toda a gente continua a dizer que não é culpa minha, mas tipo, sinceramente, se eu tivesse lutado mais para ficar com a unidade talvez pudesse ter—[voz trémula] talvez alguma coisa tivesse sido diferente. [muito baixinho] Martinez, pá. Jesus. [suspiro] Desculpa-me tanto, irmão.
597. Consegui. Eu mesmo—Deus, eu mesmo consegui. [voz trémula] Enfrentei-o ali mesmo à frente de toda a gente, e sinceramente, a cara dele foi... [amargo] 3 anos dos insultos dele, dos gritos dele, a fazer-me sentir um inútil, e finalmente eu simplesmente— [pausa] Quer dizer, quando ele me atirou aquele relatório hoje, qualquer coisa estalou. [zangado] "Não podes tratar as pessoas assim, Mark!" Foi o que eu disse. [riso] Acreditas nisto? Eu, a dizer mesmo estas palavras em voz alta?

[ansioso] Fogo, hum, vou mesmo ser despedido amanhã, não vou? Tipo, não há maneira de ele deixar isto passar. [suspiro] Mas a cena é que, nem sequer—estranhamente, acho que nem me importo? [aliviado] Isto é uma loucura? A minha renda vence para a semana e estou aqui a sentir-me, sei lá, tipo... livre? [sussurrando] Estava tudo a olhar. A Jenny disse-me "finalmente" sem som, da secretária dela.

[preocupado] Merda, e se ele torna impossível eu arranjar outro emprego? Sabes como ele é com as referências e— [desvanecendo] aliás, não. [confiante] Não, estou farto de ter medo dele. [muito baixinho] Amanhã vai ser o inferno, mas esta noite? Esta noite defendi-me. [falando sorrindo] E sinceramente, isso soube mesmo, mesmo bem.
598. Three years. Three years of my hands on every single stone, and they're... [amargo] they're bringing in bulldozers tomorrow morning. For a parking lot. I keep thinking maybe I heard wrong, but um, no. The notice is right there on the wall I spent six months on—the one with the Celtic knotwork that took me forever to get right. [frustrado] God, do they have any idea what goes into this? 

[pausa]

Each stone, I mean, you have to understand its grain, how it wants to break. [muito melancólico] There's this one piece near the entrance where I had to work around a natural vein of quartz, and it caught the morning light so perfectly. Now it's gonna be under some guy's Honda Civic. 

[zangado] A parking lot! Not even something—I don't know—respectable? [desvanecendo] Just asphalt and yellow lines and...

My grandfather taught me this trade. [voz trémula] He always said buildings should outlive their makers, that's the whole point. That's why we work in stone, not wood, not steel. Stone endures. [baixinho] Supposed to endure, anyway.

[suspiro] 

I guess nothing really lasts anymore, does it? Everything's temporary. Even stone. [amargo] Especially when there's money in parking spaces.
599. Mais uma carta de recusa para escrever. [exausto] Meu Deus, eu já—já nem consigo olhar mais para este processo, sabes? Esta mulher, ela está, hum, ela claramente não consegue trabalhar. Quer dizer, [amargo] os registos médicos estão aqui mesmo, mostram literalmente que ela não aguenta de pé mais de 10 minutos, mas pronto... [suspiro] De alguma forma tenho de encontrar a tecnicalidade que faz com que ela não se qualifique. [frustrado] É sempre uma coisa estúpida tipo, ah, ela não foi ao especialista certo ou, é, os papéis são de há 4 meses em vez de 3.

[triste] A questão é que eu sei o que vem a seguir. Ela vai recorrer, obviamente, e depois, bem, [baixinho] talvez arranje um advogado se tiver sorte. A maioria não arranja. A maioria simplesmente... [desvanecendo]

[zangado] E o que me deixa mesmo lixado—a minha supervisora disse-me ontem literalmente que a nossa taxa de aprovação está "alta demais." Alta demais! Tipo, [sarcástico] desculpem lá por realmente ler os processos? [pausa] Suponho que devo, sei lá, carimbar automaticamente "recusado" em tudo?

[muito melancólico] Eu entrei neste trabalho a pensar que ia ajudar pessoas. [ri amargamente] É essa a piada, não é? Agora sou basicamente—[voz trémula] sou a razão pela qual alguém não vai conseguir pagar os medicamentos no próximo mês. [pausa longa]

[resignado] Enfim, vou só... encontrar alguma coisa errada no formulário. Há sempre alguma coisa.
600. Três meses limpo e, hm, de repente já ninguém liga. [confuso] É tipo—quer dizer, quando eu estava a consumir, a mãe mandava mensagens de hora em hora, não é? [amargo] "Só para saber se estás bem, querido." O pai aparecia com compras, a minha irmã, sabes, basicamente geria a minha vida toda. [pausa] E agora que estou mesmo bem, é só... [muito triste] nada.

[hesitante] Acho que, tipo, eles precisavam que eu precisasse deles? Ou talvez—[voz trémula] Deus, isto é tão fodido—maybe they only knew how to love me when I was broken. [fungando] A cena é que, er, eu pensava que ficar limpo ia resolver tudo, mas honestamente, é como se os tivesse perdido. [chorando ao falar] Eles não sabem o que fazer comigo agora que não sou a emergência deles.

[zangado] E parte de mim quer simplesmente—não. [firmemente] Não, não posso pensar assim. [pausa] Mas Cristo, sabes, ser o desastre da família era literalmente o meu papel durante tanto tempo. [muito baixinho] Agora não sou nada de ninguém. [pausa longa]

[muito melancólico] Salvei a minha vida e, hm, perdi a minha família. [suspiro] How's that for irony? Enfim, acho que—[desvanecendo] não sei. [muito devagar] Maybe this is what growing up actually feels like.
601. [amargo] Trinta anos. Hum, trinta anos que ando aqui a trabalhar madeira neste espaço, e agora esta—esta gente muda-se para cá com o seu, [sarcástico] o seu "luxo urbano" e de repente eu é que sou o problema? [pausa] Tipo, sinceramente, o que é que esperavam ao mudarem-se para o lado de uma oficina? [frustrado] A questão é que, ah, eu estava aqui primeiro. Muito antes das torres de vidro deles e, sabes, dos estúdios de yoga. [suspiro]

Quer dizer, esta manhã estava só—[muito triste] estava a olhar para as ferramentas do meu avô na parede, e pensei... [desvanecendo] Meu Deus. [pausa longa] Cada violino, cada guitarra que passou por aqui tem, hum, tem basicamente a história de alguém lá dentro. [caloroso] O primeiro instrumento de recital da filha da Sra. Chen. Aquele miúdo do, é, do bairro que não podia pagar—[voz embargando] enfim.

[zangado] E para quê? Para eles poderem ter a sua, a sua "meditação matinal em paz" sem ouvir trabalho artesanal a sério? [riso] Pois. Porque Deus nos livre de alguém fazer alguma coisa com as mãos hoje em dia. [sussurrando] O senhorio nem sequer me olha nos olhos.

[muito melancólico] Mas sabes que mais? Acho que... [pausa] talvez seja só—[resignado] tudo muda, não é? [amargo] Mesmo quando não devia ter de ser assim.
602. [exausto] Mais um envelope com dinheiro hoje. As propinas do próximo semestre, assim sem mais. [amargo] Sabes, eu costumava ficar entusiasmado com isto. Agora só... [suspiro] Olho-me ao espelho depois dos encontros e nem sequer— [voz trémula] quem é esta pessoa? [pausa] O pior é que me tornei mesmo bom nisto. O riso que não é meu, as histórias que conto sobre uma infância que nunca tive. [resmungando] Até me apanhei a usar aquele sotaque falso no supermercado ontem. [riso] Deus.

[devagar] O meu grupo de estudo perguntou porque é que nunca saio. O que é que eu vou dizer, hum, "Desculpem, tenho um cliente que me leva para o Dubai aos fins de semana"? [sarcástico] Ya, isso ia correr mesmo bem. [pausa longa] Continuo a dizer a mim mesmo que é temporário. Só mais dois anos. [chorando ao falar] Mas já há bocados de mim que desapareceram, tipo— [frustrado] Já nem me lembro do que é que eu gosto mesmo. Vinho? Ou é só o que eles esperam? [sussurrando] Música clássica? Ou é ela, a versão de mim pela qual estão a pagar?

[muito triste] A minha mãe pensa que recebi uma bolsa. [riso alto] Se ela soubesse. [desvanecendo] Às vezes pergunto-me se o diploma de medicina vai valer o que estou a perder para o conseguir...
603. [exausto] We won. Quer dizer, é isso que lhe estão a chamar, não é? Vitória. Hum, todos aqueles anos de—de nos escondermos nas montanhas, as emboscadas, as... [amargo] tudo o que acreditávamos que valia a pena. E honestamente, suponho que taticamente falando, ganhámos. Os ocupantes foram-se embora. [pausa] But there's this, uh, this smell in the village square that won't—[fungando] Meu Deus, aqueles não eram soldados. Continuo a dizer a mim próprio, sabes, guerra de guerrilha significa que todos estão envolvidos, todos são um potencial... mas ela estava só a vender pão. [voz trémula] Her kids were right there when the—quando nós—[pausa longa] 

I mean, what were we supposed to do, right? Eles estavam a usar edifícios civis, escondendo-se entre... [desvanecendo] Não, isso não é—é o que eles também diziam, não é? Sobre nós. [sussurrando] Cristo, o nome dela era Maria. Eu sabia mesmo o nome dela. Ela costumava, hum, acenar-me antes de isto tudo começar. [zangado] And now her kids are—they're orphans because of what? Por causa da nossa gloriosa libertação? [chorando ao falar] We freed them from occupation and gave them... o quê exatamente? Casas vazias e, uh, valas comuns e—[muito baixinho] já nem reconheço no que nos tornámos.
604. [voz trémula] Olha, eu, hum—nem sei como começar isto. [pigarreando] Provavelmente não me reconheces assim todo arranjado, mas eu sou o tipo que, sabes, que ficava ali na esquina junto à loja? [emocionado] E tu davas-me o teu almoço todos os dias, tipo—[pausa] todos os santos dias durante oito meses. [chorando ao falar] Arranjei casa. Consegui mesmo—consegui um sítio. Consegues acreditar? [fungando] É só um estúdio, mas pronto, tem paredes e uma porta que tranca e, [muito sinceramente], por tua causa nunca fui para a cama com fome mesmo quando tudo o resto estava a desabar. [caloroso] Davas-me aquele saco castanho e dizias "tem um bom dia" como se eu fosse, quer dizer, como se eu fosse uma pessoa qualquer. Não invisível. [pausa] A questão é que a maioria das pessoas passava ao lado, mas tu—[emocionado] tu viste-me. Viste-me mesmo. [riso] Começo o meu trabalho na próxima semana, a lavar pratos naquele café da Rua Terceira. [confiante] E um dia, juro-te, vou ser EU a pagar-te o almoço. [muito baixinho] Obrigado por, basicamente, me teres mantido vivo quando eu não conseguia fazê-lo sozinho. [caloroso] Obrigado por me tratares como um ser humano quando eu já me tinha esquecido que era um.
605. [amargo] Deus, quer dizer, eu tinha razão desde o início, não tinha? Sobre as pessoas. Hum, aquela história nas notícias hoje—aquela em que, tipo, passaram mesmo ao lado daquela mulher que pedia ajuda—[pausa] é exatamente o que ando a dizer há anos. A humanidade é simplesmente... [desvanecendo]

[frustrado] E sinceramente, toda a gente age como se eu é que fosse o problema por apontar isto. "És tão negativo," dizem eles. Bem, é... talvez eu esteja só a prestar atenção? [sarcástico] Desculpem lá por reparar que as pessoas são basicamente animais egoístas vestidos de escritório.

[baixinho] Mas olha—e eu, ah, detesto admitir isto—[hesitante] não falo com ninguém há, quê, 3 semanas agora? Falar a sério, quero dizer. Não é só, sabes, pedir um café ou assim. [pausa longa]

[voz trémula] E é tipo... hmm, sinto que estou a ficar esquisito. Mais esquisito. No outro dia tive uma conversa inteira com a minha gata sobre, hum, taxas de juro. [riso] Ela não quis saber. Obviamente.

[muito melancólico] Portanto estou preso, não é? Porque as pessoas são—são horríveis, são mesmo, mas aparentemente eu, [suspiro], ainda preciso delas de alguma forma? [ansioso] Mesmo sabendo que só me vão desiludir, magoar-me, provar que tenho razão outra vez.

[muito baixinho] Não sei como resolver isto. Ter razão não, é... não torna o silêncio menos barulhento.
606. [amargo] 20 anos que ando a trabalhar para chegar a banquet manager, e uh, adivinha? Finalmente consegui. [riso] Na mesma semana em que a Sara decide que está—[pausa] que está farta. Tipo, sinceramente, que timing é este? [sarcástico] "Parabéns pela promoção," disseram-me. Meanwhile, I'm sleeping on my brother's couch. 

[confuso] Quer dizer, eu devia estar a celebrar, não é? This is literally everything I've worked for. O problema é que, [muito triste] fico a olhar para este cartão de visita novo e é só... papel. [suspiro] 

Ela disse—[voz trémula] Meu Deus, ela disse mesmo que me importo mais com arranjos de mesa do que com o nosso casamento. E talvez—[arrependido] não sei, maybe she's right? Tipo, quantos aniversários é que perdi por causa de, er, alguma gala corporativa? 

[zangado] Mas não é justo! I was doing this for us! Para o nosso—[desvanecendo] tanto faz. [exausto] Já não importa, pois não?

[resmungando] Amanhã tenho de coordenar o casamento dos Henderson. 500 convidados. [muito baixinho] E eu nem consigo, hmm, manter uma pessoa feliz. [pausa longa] 

[choro] Consegui tudo o que queria profissionalmente, e estou—[fungando] estou completamente sozinho. [sussurrando] Como é que estraguei isto tão mal?
607. [confuso] Espera, o quê? Isto não pode ser—deixa-me, hum, ler isto outra vez. [pausa] Investigação à minha licença por... violações? [ansioso] Quer dizer, que violações? Eu nunca—nunca fiz nada que pudesse, sabes, justificar uma coisa destas. [frustrado] Foda-se, isto é uma merda do caralho, sinceramente. 20 anos, [zangado] 20 anos, porra, que ando nisto e agora de repente há, o quê, uma queixa anónima? [voz trémula] O problema é, como é que provas que não fizeste uma coisa quando, tipo, não há provas concretas para nenhum dos lados? [pausa longa] Eu tenho todos os registos, é, meticulosamente organizados, mas eles dizem que há, [amargo] ah aparentemente há "irregularidades" nos pagamentos de clientes que eu supostamente desviei. [sarcástico] Pois, claro, porque eu ia arriscar a minha carreira toda por quê, uns milhares de euros? [perturbado] Os meus filhos, ah, vão ver isto online, os amigos deles vão—[desvanecendo] Nem consigo... [suspiro] E o pior, o pior de tudo é que, bem, eu sei perfeitamente quem está por trás disto. [furioso] Aquela cobra do Martinez anda há meses a tentar roubar-me os clientes e agora, [choro] agora vai consegui-los porque mesmo que eu seja ilibado, que vou ser, o estrago já está—[chorando ao falar] Eu só, trabalhei tanto para isto.
608. [aliviado] Oh my God, so, I still can't believe what happened today. I mean, I'm just pushing carts around the parking lot, right? [nervoso] And, um, I notice this guy—he's like stumbling near the loading dock where, you know, those massive delivery trucks back up. [preocupado] Well, the thing is, he drops his phone and he's, er, completely oblivious that this eighteen-wheeler is literally starting to reverse. [ansioso] I just—I started waving my arms like crazy, [gritando] "HEY! HEY! STOP!" [pausa] But honestly, the driver couldn't hear me through all that noise. [rapidamente] So I'm thinking, oh God oh God, and I basically sprint to security—I mean, I've never run that fast in my life. [voz trémula] And they, uhh, they radio the dock immediately and the truck stops like, [arqueja alto] maybe three feet from where this guy is still looking for his phone! [pausa longa] The security guard, he actually told me later that, [caloroso] you know, if I hadn't noticed... [desvanecendo] I don't even want to think about it. [orgulhoso] But anyway, they said I might get employee of the month or something, which is, [riso] I mean, I push carts for a living, so that's pretty cool, I guess. [suspiro] Just... what a day, honestly.
609. Vinte e três anos. É o tempo que ando nisto. Vinte e três anos da minha vida, e eles simplesmente... [amargo] votaram sim. A favor de tudo. Cada coisinha que dissemos que nunca iríamos ceder. Quer dizer, estou aqui sentado a olhar para o comunicado de imprensa e é tipo—[confuso] será que se esqueceram de quem somos? Será que se esqueceram do motivo pelo qual começámos isto?

[zangado] Expansão prisional! Apoiaram a expansão prisional! Nós literalmente—a nossa cena toda era acabar com o encarceramento em massa, e agora de repente é "compromisso estratégico" e "progresso incremental". [sarcástico] Ah pois, vamos lá construir mais jaulas, isso é que vai resolver tudo.

Larguei o meu escritório de advocacia por isto. [triste] O meu casamento foi-se abaixo porque estava sempre em protestos, sempre a organizar, sempre... Foda-se, a Sara disse-me que eu me preocupava mais com estranhos do que com a minha própria família. Talvez ela tivesse razão. [pausa] E para quê? Para eles se sentarem numa sala de reuniões e basicamente apertarem a mão às mesmas pessoas que nos mandaram gás lacrimogéneo?

[exausto] Sei lá a quem é que hei de ligar agora. Toda a gente com quem eu quereria falar provavelmente votou a favor. Devem estar todos a celebrar a sua "vitória histórica" enquanto eu estou aqui a sentir que acabei de ver o trabalho da minha vida a arder. [muito baixinho] Vinte e três anos. Para que raio é que foi tudo isto?
610. [amargo] Look, I mean, the money's great—honestly, it's never been better. These new people moving in with their, you know, restored brownstones and whatever, they all want authentic chimney sweeps. [riso] Authentic. Like I'm some kind of artisanal—I don't know, performer or something. But here's the thing, [triste] Mrs. Rodriguez had to move out last month. Forty years she lived next door, and now it's just... gone. [pausa] Her whole family, actually. 

So yeah, um, business is booming. [sarcástico] Congratulations to me, right? I've got more clients than I can handle, and they're paying triple what the old neighbors used to. But like—[frustrado] where's Tony's deli? Where's the corner store where Mr. Chen knew everyone's name? Now it's all, er, kombucha bars and—what do they call them—boutique pet spas. 

[muito baixinho] Sometimes I walk down these streets and I don't even recognize them anymore. And the thing is, [confuso] they love me, these new people. They literally take photos of me working, post them online talking about "keeping tradition alive" while they're the ones who—[zangado] who pushed out all the actual tradition! [suspiro] 

I guess I should be grateful. I mean, the business is set for life now. [arrependido] Just wish the neighborhood I built it in was still here.
Character 1: You can see me standing here in your blueprints, [confuso], can't you, even though I died in this very theater, [sussurrando], ninety-three years ago when the chandelier fell during opening night, [amargo], crushing everything I'd worked for.
611. [chocado] This can't be real, but I recognize you from the portrait in the lobby, [voz trémula], the one they never took down after the accident.
Character 1: [pleased] Finally, someone who understands.
612. [hesitante] I've been, um, studying your original designs for months now, and well, there's something, [curioso], hidden in the foundation that doesn't make sense, like, a room that shouldn't exist according to, [nervoso], any architectural logic I know.
Character 1: [caloroso] Well, umm, you found it then, the space I designed, [arrependido], but never got to reveal before everything ended so suddenly, you know?
613. Every time I try to map it out, um, the measurements keep, [frustrado], shifting like the walls themselves are, well, refusing to be documented properly, I mean.
Character 1: [revealing] That room was meant to be, uhh, my masterpiece within a masterpiece, you know, a space that, [apaixonado], defies conventional physics because I built it to exist between, [sussurrando alto], the living world and wherever I am now, um, trapped. [suspiro]
614. [ansioso] So, err, you're telling me I've been working on renovating a building that's, [devagar], partially existing in two dimensions at once, like, some kind of architectural anomaly?
Character 1: [gentilmente] I need you to, umm, finish what I started because, [desesperado], being stuck here watching my work decay is, well, worse than death itself. [gemido]
615. [com empatia] The city wants to demolish this place next month if I can't prove it's worth, [zangado], saving, but they don't understand the genius of what you, [muito baixinho], created here. [pausa]
Character 1: [melancólico] You know, um, I spent twenty years designing this theater to be, [orgulhoso], a bridge between art and eternity, but, well, I became the only thing that, [desvanecendo], crossed over when the chandelier... [tosse]
616. [determinado] Show me the rest of your hidden blueprints, the ones that, [entusiasmado], aren't in any archive, and together we can, [confiante], save this place from destruction. [riso]
Character 1: The blueprints are, um, literally written into the walls themselves if you know, [mysterious], where to look. [pausa longa]
617. [intrigued] Well, I mean, I've been feeling drawn to certain corners of this building, like, [pensativo], something's been guiding my restoration choices, and um, now I understand it's been you all along, [aliviado], helping me see what others miss.
Character 1: [tristemente] Once you complete the hidden room, um, I'll finally be able to leave this place, but, well, I need you to promise you'll, [severo], protect what we've built together, because this theater is, [muito sinceramente], more than just brick and mortar. [fungando]
618. Your legacy won't die with demolition because, umm, I'm going to make sure everyone understands the, [animado], revolutionary design you created here, you know?
Character 1: Time moves differently when you're dead, but watching you work these past months has, [grato], given me hope that my vision will outlive even, [sereno], this ghostly existence I'm trapped in.
619. [lacrimoso] I promise to finish your work, and um, when I do, maybe you'll finally find the, [suave], peace you've been searching for all these years. [choro]
Character 1: [fading] The sunrise is coming and I'm growing transparent again, but tomorrow night, [esperançoso], we continue our work together. [suspiro suave]
620. I'll be here with my drafting table set up exactly where yours once stood, [emocionado], waiting for you to show me the secrets hidden in these, [determinado], beautiful old walls. [respiração profunda]
Character 1: [amargo] I got another rejection today, this time from, [voz trémula], that small press you said would be perfect for my work, and I just, [derrotado], can't keep pretending I have what it takes to be a real writer.
621. [caloroso] Listen, um, I know how crushing these rejections feel, but, like, [gentilmente], your writing has something special that, well, [apaixonado], most people take years to develop, and um, I really believe in your voice.
Character 1: Well, maybe you're just saying that because, um, you love me and, like, [frustrado], you don't want to admit your partner is a failure, you know?
622. [com empatia] Being thousands of miles away makes it harder to, [pausa], show you how much I genuinely respect your work beyond just loving you.
Character 1: You've published three novels already and here I am, [embarrassed], still getting form rejections that don't even, [muito baixinho], mention anything specific about my writing, just that generic, [desvanecendo], 'not right for us at this time' nonsense.
623. Um, the publishing world is, like, [hesitante], incredibly subjective and timing matters so much more than, well, [ansioso], talent sometimes, which is why, umm, [pigarreando], I need to tell you something important.
Character 1: [confuso] What do you mean you need to, [nervoso], tell me something—did you do something with, [acelerando], my manuscript without asking me first?
624. I, um, might have shown your latest story to, like, [apologético], my editor when she was asking about new voices, and, well, [entusiasmado], she wants to meet with you next week, um, if you're interested.
Character 1: [zangado] So you just, um, went behind my back and used your, like, [alto], connections to get me a pity meeting that I didn't, well, [magoado], earn on my own merit? I mean, that's exactly what I was afraid of!
625. [firmemente] No, I mean, I simply gave her your work without, like, [severo], mentioning our relationship at all, and um, she loved it based purely on, well, [confiante], the quality of your writing, nothing else.
Character 1: But um, how am I supposed to know if, like, [incerto], any success I might have is real or just, well, [sussurrando], because I'm dating someone famous who, umm, [suspiro], pulled strings for me?
626. [muito sinceramente] Because, um, I've watched you pour your soul into every page for, like, [orgulhoso], three years now, and well, talent like yours doesn't need my name attached to succeed.
Character 1: I don't know if I can, um, believe that when everyone will think, like, [melancólico], I only got published because of who I'm with, not because I actually, well, [muito triste], deserve it on my own. [pausa longa]
627. Look, I mean, the meeting is yours to take or leave, but um, [rationally], my editor has rejected work from my own friends before, so like, [sincero], she wouldn't waste her time if she didn't see real potential in you.
Character 1: [chorando ao falar] Um, I just—[gasp]
628. I know being apart makes you, um, doubt yourself more, but like, [loving], I see your brilliance even from across the ocean. I mean, that's never changed.
Character 1: [aliviado] Maybe you're right.
629. Take the meeting and let your work, [determinado], speak for itself—that's all I'm, [supportive], asking you to do.
Character 1: [trémulo] Okay, um, I'll take the meeting, but like, [esperançoso], only if she truly doesn't know about us, because I mean, I need this to be mine.
630. It already is yours, every beautiful, [terno], word of it, and soon everyone else will, [smile], know that too.
Character 1: [calm] Well, um, I suppose you're wondering why I've, [amused], taken such an interest in substation fourteen, er, especially during this delightful heatwave when, [satisfied], everyone's running their air conditioners at maximum.
631. [estável] I know, um, exactly why you're there and, [profissional], what you're capable of doing, so, well, let's talk about how we resolve this before anyone gets hurt.
Character 1: [intrigued] You sound remarkably composed for someone whose entire grid is, [encantado], thirty seconds away from cascading failure if I, [pensativo], flip just one more breaker in this fascinating, [appreciative], control room.
632. Um, the thing is, I've already rerouted power through, [focado], substations nine and twenty-two, so, er, your leverage isn't quite what you think it is.
Character 1: [impressionado] Oh, um, that's clever, really clever, but, well, you're forgetting that I've been, [metódico], studying your grid patterns for months and I know about the, [gleeful], children's hospital on circuit seven that can't handle, [precise], even a five-second interruption.
633. [tense] The hospital has backup generators that will, [firme], engage immediately and we've already dispatched emergency crews to, [urgente], every critical care facility in the affected zones.
Character 1: [rindo baixinho] Um, generators, yes, but, well, they take twelve seconds to reach full capacity and, [clinical], those ventilators in the NICU need continuous power or, [matter-of-fact], thirty-seven premature infants experience critical oxygen drops.
634. [desesperado] Listen to me very carefully because those infants you're, [suplicante], talking about are real human beings with families who love them.
Character 1: [curioso] Real human beings, yes, that's what makes this so, [fascinated], interesting to observe because you're calculating right now whether to, [analytical], save those thirty-seven or the two thousand elderly residents in non-powered care homes.
635. [determinado] Well, um, I don't have to choose because we've got mobile generators already, [confiante], en route to every facility, so, er, whatever you think you're proving here, it's not working.
Character 1: [amused] Mobile generators, hmm, but you only have, um, forty-two units available and, well, I count sixty-eight critical facilities in the affected zone.
636. [frustrado] You've done your homework but you're missing the fact that neighboring, [enfático], utilities are already sending their emergency resources and we'll have full, [resoluto], coverage within fifteen minutes.
Character 1: [pensativo] Um, fifteen minutes is, well, quite a long time for someone on, [precise], life support, and, er, your voice just cracked which tells me you're not as, [observant], confident about those resources as you're pretending.
637. [tremendo] Look, um, I mean, whatever psychological game you're playing here, well, [zangado], real people will die if you follow through with this and, [quebrado], that blood will be on your hands forever. [expira bruscamente]
Character 1: [detached] Blood on my hands implies I would feel something about it, which is, [clinical], rather presumptuous of you, though I do find your, [interested], emotional investment in strangers quite fascinating.
638. Every person on this grid is, [protective], my responsibility and I've spent ten years keeping them, [apaixonado], safe through hurricanes and ice storms and I'm not letting some, [feroz], sociopath destroy that today.
Character 1: [pleased] Well, um, actually I prefer the term psychopath, it's more, [pedantic], clinically accurate, and, er, I must say your dedication is, [appreciative], admirable even if ultimately futile.
639. [exausto] Um, so, what do you actually want here, I mean, [direct], there has to be something you're trying to achieve beyond just, [searching], watching me scramble to protect people, well, unless that's the whole point, [amargo], which would be particularly sick.
Character 1: [contemplativo] What I want, um, well, is to see if someone like you would actually, [probing], sacrifice those thirty-seven infants to save the two thousand elderly, er, because that's the real choice here, [philosophical], isn't it?
640. [determinado] You know what, um, I've just realized something important here, well, [calm], you need me to make that choice because you're incapable of, [compreensivo], feeling the weight of it yourself, and, er, that's actually quite, [sympathetic], sad when you think about it. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [startled] Please don't call anyone, I'll just, [voz trémula], leave right now and you can pretend you never saw me hiding behind those paper rolls.
641. [severo] Well, um, I've been printing your face, [confuso], all week long on these missing person flyers, so, I mean, thousands of copies with your school photo and, [baixinho], that same jacket you're wearing right now. [pausa]
Character 1: [defensivo] Um, those flyers are, like, everywhere but nobody actually, [amargo], looks at them anyway, they just, you know, [frustrado], walk past like I'm already gone. [suspiro]
642. [com empatia] Your mom came in here, um, three times to check the print quality, and well, she kept, [trémulo], touching your photo on the proof sheets like she was trying to, [muito baixinho], memorize every detail before you disappeared completely. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [sussurrando] She actually cares?
643. The ink on these machines costs more than my, [hesitante], rent but she insisted on the highest quality because she said your eyes needed to look, [caloroso], exactly right so people would recognize you.
Character 1: [ansioso] I've been sleeping here for four nights between the, [exausto], paper storage shelves and watching you work the machines, [devagar], wondering if you'd eventually notice me.
644. Kid, I mean, I noticed you the first night but, um, figured anyone desperate enough to, [arrependido], sleep in a print shop probably had, well, [preocupado], nowhere else safe to go, so I just, you know, [desvanecendo], kept the heat on and left some food by the break room.
Character 1: You, [chocado], knew?
645. [gentilmente] These machines have motion sensors that alert my phone, and besides, [risadinha], you left chocolate fingerprints on the paper cutter which is, [amused], definitely not part of my usual maintenance routine.
Character 1: [apologético] Um, I tried to stay out of your way and, well, not touch anything important.
646. [pensativo] You know, um, I ran away once too when I was, like, about your age, and someone at a, [nostálgico], diner let me wash dishes for food instead of calling the cops.
Character 1: [curioso] So, um, you're not going to, I mean, turn me in or, you know, call my parents right now? [suspiro suave]
647. First, let's get you something better than vending machine chips to, [caring], eat while we figure out what's really going on at, [sério], home that made you run. [tosse]
Character 1: My stepdad keeps saying I'm not really, [zangado], part of the family and that my mom would be, [chorando ao falar], happier if I just disappeared.
648. Well, umm, a woman who spends her savings on, like, premium flyers and comes here crying doesn't, [firmemente], sound like someone who wants their kid gone, you know?
Character 1: [esperançoso] Maybe she just didn't know how to, [incerto], stand up to him when he said those things. [fungando]
649. [confiante] Tomorrow morning, we're printing a special edition that says you've been, [aliviado], found safe. [riso]
Character 1: [lacrimoso] You'd really help me go back, [assustado], even though things might not change with him there?
650. Change starts when people know they're not, [determinado], alone in seeing what's wrong, and your mom needs to, [apaixonadamente], hear what you just told me before it's, [urgently], too late to fix this family.
651. You know what's funny? Everyone always says I'm too negative, right? Like, "Oh there you go again, always looking for problems." Well, [aliviado] guess who just stopped Dad from wiring twenty thousand dollars to some fake investment guru. [riso] Yeah, that's right—me and my annoying need to, you know, actually verify things. 

[sarcástico] "But honey, he seemed so trustworthy on the video call!" Sure Mom, because scammers never seem trustworthy. I mean, [frustrado] this is exactly why I ask questions! But no, usually it's all eye rolls and "why can't you just trust people?" 

The thing is, um, when I started googling this guy's company—[entusiasmado] literally nothing came up except his own website! Created two weeks ago! And then, er, Dad's sitting there with his bank app open, [ansioso] about to hit send on our entire emergency fund because this guy promised forty percent returns in three months. 

[amargo] Nobody ever appreciates the skeptic until the skeptic saves the day, honestly. But like, [caloroso] seeing Dad's face when he realized... when it actually clicked what almost happened? [pausa] I'd rather be the annoying one who asks too many questions than, well, the family who loses everything because nobody wanted to seem rude. [suspiro] Anyway, they're making my favorite dinner tonight, so I guess being paranoid has its perks.
Character 1: [amargo] Não esperava que estivesse aqui alguém, hum, uma vez que o agente imobiliário disse que a, [frio], propriedade estaria vazia para a minha, bem, [baixinho], última vistoria antes de pôr à venda. [pausa]
652. [apologético] O seu pai pediu-me para continuar a, [devagar], manter a piscina até a casa ser vendida porque disse que era, [caloroso], a única coisa que não devia morrer com ele mesmo sabendo, [desvanecendo], que o senhor ia querer vender rapidamente.
Character 1: [frustrado] Bem, quer dizer, isso parece mesmo dele, sempre a fazer, [severo], arranjos sem consultar ninguém, especialmente, é, [monótono], o único filho que teve de vir de Los Angeles só para, hum, tratar disto tudo.
653. Hum, ele falava do senhor todas as semanas quando eu vinha, [com empatia], limpar os filtros e verificar os químicos, sempre a perguntar-se se, bem, [voz trémula], algum dia voltaria a nadar nesta piscina como fazia em miúdo.
Character 1: A piscina era a obsessão dele, não a minha, e ele passava mais tempo, [ansioso], a flutuar ali do que alguma vez passou, [arrependido], a falar comigo sobre qualquer coisa que realmente, [muito baixinho], importasse nas nossas vidas.
654. [hesitante] Ele disse-me que o senhor se tornou advogado de entretenimento para, [apaixonadamente], provar que não precisava do dinheiro dele mas guardava todos os, [orgulhoso], artigos sobre os seus casos num álbum junto à casa da piscina.
Character 1: [confuso] Não há álbum nenhum na casa—já revi, [exausto], tudo para a venda do espólio e não encontrei nada a não ser, [amargo], documentos financeiros e vinte anos de, [zangado], recibos de manutenção da piscina. [suspiro]
655. [gentilmente] Está no barracão da casa da piscina, hum, escondido atrás dos produtos químicos onde ele se, [sussurrando], sentava a lê-los vezes sem conta, sabe.
Character 1: [perturbado] Então um estranho que limpava a piscina dele sabia mais sobre, [trémulo], os sentimentos dele do que o próprio filho que tentava ligar-lhe, [chorando ao falar], todos os feriados só para ouvir falar de níveis de cloro e, [voz trémula], equilíbrio do pH em vez de qualquer coisa real. [riso]
656. Bem, quer dizer, eu não era um estranho para ele depois de vinte anos—falávamos durante, [tristemente], horas enquanto eu trabalhava, hum, sobre tudo.
Character 1: [muito melancólico] Hum, tudo menos como é que havia de, pronto, dizer ao filho que o amava, suponho.
657. [sinceramente] Ele amava-o mas tinha um medo terrível de, [nervoso], águas profundas e conversas emocionais por igual, e é por isso que, hum, [formal], me contratou para manter tanto a piscina onde nunca nadava como, bem, [pigarreando], a distância que não conseguia atravessar. [gemido]
Character 1: [sussurrando alto] Quer dizer, isso é suposto tornar isto mais fácil de alguma forma, saber que ele, hum, [pausa], pagava a alguém para ouvir o que eu devia ter ouvido?
658. [timidamente] Bem, hum, talvez não.
Character 1: [gritando] Acabe lá o trabalho!
659. [aliviado] Antes de ir embora, há uma carta que ele lhe escreveu e que me pediu para, [cuidadosamente], lhe entregar só depois de a casa estar vazia mas já que o senhor está, [emocionado], aqui agora acho que ele ia querer que a tivesse.
Character 1: [em lágrimas] Hum, não sei se consigo ler mais uma das suas, [acelerando], listas sobre manutenção de piscinas ou valores imobiliários quando o que eu precisava eram, bem, [desesperadamente], palavras reais sobre nós, sobre porque é que ele não conseguia simplesmente, é, [quebrado], dizer o que importava.
660. [compassivo] Bem, não é sobre a piscina, hum, é sobre o verão em que quase se afogou e como ele, [embargado], nunca mais entrou na água depois desse dia.
Character 1: [chocado] Eu tinha 6 anos e mal me lembro desse dia mas, hum, [muito devagar], ele nunca me disse que foi por isso que parou de nadar, nunca explicou porque é que ficava, bem, [ofegante], parado na beira a olhar para mim mas nunca, sabes, [pesaroso], entrava mesmo quando eu lhe implorava para brincar. [choro]
661. A carta explica tudo o que ele não conseguiu dizer—como salvá-lo nesse dia, [pesadamente], o fez perceber que o podia perder, e o medo, [pesaroso], paralisou-o de mais formas do que apenas nadar.
Character 1: [hesitante] Bem, hum, quando organizei a extração de emergência através de, [confuso], canais seguros, não esperava, eh, [desvanecendo], ver-te ao volante depois de quinze anos...
662. Hum, pois, quer dizer, a vida deu umas, [baixinho], voltas interessantes depois de teres ido para o mundo empresarial, e, pronto, aqui estamos no meu Honda a parecer uma viagem normal de uber.
Character 1: [ansioso] Então, hum, estás a dizer-me que, [voz trémula], o meu antigo parceiro do clube de xadrez que calculava distribuições ideais da rede elétrica, [frustrado], agora calcula rotas de fuga ideais de, eh, [nervoso], cenas de crime? [suspiro]
663. [amargo] Bem, hum, nem toda a gente pode gerir programas municipais de energia enquanto, [devagar], está sentado em escritórios com ar condicionado, sabes? [pausa]
Character 1: [arrependido] Quer dizer, Marcus, quando abandonaste o curso de engenharia, hum, tentei ajudar mas tu simplesmente, [perturbado], desapareceste sem sequer dizer adeus ou, tipo, [sussurrando], avisar alguém que estavas vivo.
664. [monótono] A parte do adeus fica complicada quando a tua família acha que estás, [exausto], a deitar a vida fora.
Character 1: [com empatia] Estas ameaças que tenho recebido são sobre o novo programa de contadores inteligentes que supostamente, [preocupado], vai ajudar os bairros carenciados, mas alguém acha que faço, [abafado], parte de uma conspiração de vigilância.
665. [formal] O meu trabalho é levar-te do ponto A ao ponto B sem que ninguém, [rapidamente], nos siga. [tosse]
Character 1: [surpreso] Ainda fazes aquela cena de ficares todo profissional quando, [desconfortável], as emoções se aproximam demais. [riso]
666. [defensivo] Hum, bem, quer dizer, talvez.
Character 1: [caloroso] Olha, hum, sei que as coisas correram mal entre nós, mas ver-te aqui, [aliviado], faz-me sentir mais seguro do que, bem, [esperançoso], qualquer condutor anónimo faria. [risadinha]
667. Sabes, hum, conduzir para pessoas em apuros, quer dizer, [cuidadoso], não é assim tão diferente do que tu fazes com, [pensativo], infraestruturas - ambos mantemos a cidade a funcionar, só que, eh, de ângulos diferentes.
Character 1: [sussurrado] Ângulos diferentes. [suspiro suave]
668. [severo] A rota que vou fazer vai parecer aleatória mas cada curva é, [calculado], pensada para despistar qualquer perseguição enquanto parece, [casual], condução normal da cidade para as câmaras de trânsito. [pigarreando]
Character 1: [curioso] Os teus antigos modelos de probabilidade da faculdade devem dar jeito para este, [impressionado], tipo de trabalho, embora imagine que os riscos sejam, [preocupado], significativamente maiores do que calcular distribuições de carga. [tom grave]
669. Bem, hum, quando a vida de alguém está em jogo, sabes, [focado], cada cálculo importa mais do que qualquer equação que, [sério], tenhamos resolvido nas aulas, e quer dizer, [sombrio], falhar não é só uma má nota. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [suave] Hum, depois de passarmos por isto, quer dizer, talvez pudéssemos, [incerto], tentar falar outra vez?
670. [cauteloso] Bem, hum, primeiro vamos garantir que há um depois, mas, eh, [ponderando], mantenho o mesmo telemóvel descartável para clientes habituais que possam, [significativo], precisar de um amigo que conhece os caminhos alternativos.
Character 1: Ainda tenho o teu velho tabuleiro de xadrez no meu escritório, aquele que, [nostálgico], deixaste para trás, e, hum, às vezes monto o tabuleiro como se ainda estivéssemos, [melancólico], a meio do nosso último jogo. [fungando]
671. [comovido] Cavalo para E5 ia ser a minha próxima, [recordando], jogada se ainda te perguntas depois de todos, [melancólico], estes anos. [pausa breve]
Character 1: [surpreso] Estás com um aspeto terrível, pensei que íamos, [hesitante], encontrar-nos esta noite mas mal consegues estar de pé.
672. [defensivo] Estou bem, só um pouco, [exausto], cansado do trabalho e talvez a lutar contra algo pequeno, [debilmente], nada que deva impedir os nossos planos. [tosse]
Character 1: [preocupado] Bem, eh, estás a arder em febre e, tipo, estás a tremer por isso talvez devêssemos, [firmemente], remarcar isto para quando não estiveres prestes a desmaiar. [suspiro]
673. [teimosamente] Não preciso que, hum, te preocupes comigo, quer dizer, não é isso que fazemos aqui, [amargo], encontramo-nos e mantemos as coisas simples sem, [desvanecendo], toda esta coisa emocional, sabes?
Character 1: [frustrado] Deus, és impossível quando ficas assim, [alto], a agir como se aceitar ajuda violasse o nosso estúpido acordo. [gemido]
674. O objetivo era, bem, sem compromissos e, ahm, agora estás a tentar, [baixinho], fazer de enfermeiro quando só preciso de dormir, quer dizer, talvez uns medicamentos.
Character 1: [sussurrando] Eh, pára, está bem?
675. [voz trémula] Olha, eu, eh, não como há dois dias porque, [nauseado], tudo me deixa enjoado e, ahm, não consigo manter nada no estômago mas não queria, [muito baixinho], cancelar contigo outra vez. [suspiro suave]
Character 1: [com empatia] Devias ter-me dito, quer dizer, em vez de fingir que está tudo normal quando estás, [ansioso], claramente a sofrer aqui sozinho neste apartamento sem, bem, ninguém para te ajudar. [pausa]
676. [apologético] Mas isso não é o teu trabalho, tipo, concordámos desde o início que não íamos, [confuso], sobrecarregar um ao outro com problemas da vida real ou, hum, envolver-nos demasiado para além das, [resmungando], coisas físicas, sabes?
Character 1: Que se lixe o que concordámos porque, hum, agora mesmo precisas de alguém para, [apaixonadamente], cuidar de ti quer isso caiba no nosso acordo ou não, bem, não te vou deixar assim.
677. [caloroso] Porque é que estás a ser tão, ahm, gentil comigo quando ambos sabemos que isto não é, [nervoso], aquilo para que nos inscrevemos e, tipo, não me deves nada para além dos nossos habituais, [devagar], encontros de terça à noite?
Character 1: [sinceramente] Talvez me importe contigo mais do que as nossas, bem, estúpidas regras me permitem admitir, [muito melancólico], até a mim próprio na maioria das noites. [fungando]
678. [chocado] Não devias, [chorando ao falar], dizer coisas dessas quando estou demasiado fraco para, [emocionado], manter os limites de que precisamos. [choro]
Character 1: [gentilmente] Deixa-me fazer-te uma sopa e arranjar-te medicamentos, [aliviado], depois podemos fingir que isto nunca aconteceu se quiseres. [risadinha]
679. [grato] Não acho que consiga, [em lágrimas], fingir mais que o que temos é só casual quando estás, [ternamente], aqui a cuidar de mim assim. [riso]
Character 1: [esperançoso] Talvez estares doente te esteja a deixar delirante mas eu fico, [feliz], bem com mudar o nosso acordo se tu também ficares, [brincalhão], quando estiveres melhor claro. [respiração profunda]
680. [falando sorrindo] A febre deve estar a baixar porque de repente tudo parece, [claramente], diferente entre nós como se talvez tenhamos estado, [entusiasmado], a enganar-nos a nós próprios este tempo todo. [gargalhada]
Character 1: [encantado] Então depois de meses a fingir que não temos sentimentos, [brincando], bastou ficares com gripe para admitir a verdade.
681. [alegre] Bem, acho que ser vulnerável tem os seus, hum, benefícios inesperados mesmo que signifique, [satisfeito], quebrar todas as regras que fizemos para, tipo, proteger-nos exatamente desta situação. [bocejo]
Character 1: Hum, querido, eu sei que hoje é um dia importante com os resultados do exame da Ordem a sair e, [caloroso], queria saber como estavas porque, bem, [com empatia], alguns dos meus examinandos trabalham nesta praça e pensei, [gentilmente], talvez tivesses ouvido alguma coisa dos teus antigos colegas da faculdade, sabes. [pausa]
682. [nervoso] Pai, espera.
Character 1: Quer dizer, às vezes fico preocupado contigo, e hum, [confuso], ver todos estes jovens advogados a receber os resultados hoje faz-me desejar que não tivesses, er, abandonado tudo. [suspiro]
683. [voz trémula] Bem, hum, há algo que te preciso de contar sobre isso porque, [ansioso], na verdade nunca abandonei completamente e, tipo, [muito baixinho], I've been studying at night for the past year enquanto, sabes, [hesitante], geria esta loja durante o dia.
Character 1: [chocado] Filho, não percebo o que estás a dizer porque, hum, [frustrado], tu disseste-me que o direito não era para ti e, bem, [amargo], you made it very clear that my career path wasn't something you wanted to follow, quer dizer, andámos a discutir sobre isto durante anos.
684. [defensivo] Pois, bem, eu precisava de provar a mim mesmo que conseguia fazer isto sem a tua ajuda ou, hum, [apaixonadamente], os teus contactos ou a tua reputação a pairar sobre mim, e tipo, [orgulhoso], I wanted to know if I was actually good enough on my own, sabes. [pausa longa]
Character 1: Fizeste o exame da Ordem?
685. [esperançoso] Fiz, e hum, the results just came through on my phone enquanto estávamos a conversar e, [trémulo], passei com uma das notas mais altas do estado, mas tipo, [chorando ao falar], estou aterrorizado com o que vais pensar. [fungando]
Character 1: Todas aquelas noites em que pensei que estavas só a trabalhar até tarde na loja, [arrependido], you were actually studying for the exam I help write.
686. [aliviado] Basicamente, sim.
Character 1: [em lágrimas] Querido, não estou zangado, estou só, [overwhelmed], completamente atónito que fizeste isto tudo sozinho quando eu podia ter, [softly], ajudado-te durante o processo.
687. [apologético] Hum, pai, é exatamente por isso que tive de fazer isto sozinho porque, bem, [sincero], I needed to earn this without anyone questioning se, er, [cuidadosamente], tive tratamento especial por ter o presidente do júri de exame como meu pai, sabes. [pigarreando]
Character 1: [a rir] Bem, hum, posso dizer-te que o teu ensaio sobre direito constitucional foi um dos melhores que li, e tipo, [orgulhoso], não fazia ideia que era teu. [suspiro suave]
688. [entusiasmado] Lembras-te do meu ensaio especificamente entre, [curioso], milhares de exames que reviste este ano?
Character 1: [caloroso] Lembro-me de pensar que whoever wrote that essay tinha uma perspetiva única sobre controlo judicial que, hum, [impressionado], me fazia lembrar das discussões que tínhamos ao jantar quando estavas no secundário, e bem, [emocionado], agora faz todo o sentido porque é que me parecia tão familiar, sabes.
689. [feliz] Então, hum, isto significa que não estás desapontado por eu ter guardado este segredo de ti durante, tipo, 1 ano inteiro? [risadinha]
Character 1: [brincalhão] Desapontado que o meu filho passou no exame da Ordem com uma das notas mais altas enquanto simultaneamente, [amused], geria um negócio de frozen yogurt bem-sucedido e, [muito sinceramente], proving he didn't need his father's help to succeed?
690. [falando sorrindo] Bem, hum, quando pões as coisas dessa maneira. [riso]
Character 1: Vem cá, doutor, porque acho que, hum, [joyful], this calls for free frozen yogurt para todos os novos advogados na praça hoje, e talvez, [mischievously], devíamos anunciar quem é que vai pagar por tudo isto, sabes. [gargalhada]
691. [encantado] Hum, também te amo, pai.
Character 1: [amargo] I've been reviewing the footage I shot last month, [frustrado], e as faixas de áudio estão a ficar piores mesmo usando o mesmo, [voz trémula], equipamento e definições que sempre funcionaram perfeitamente para mim.
692. [caloroso] The test results came back yesterday, [ansioso], e tenho estado a tentar perceber como te dizer que a deterioração, [baixinho], acelerou para além do que esperávamos.
Character 1: [desesperado] But you said the new hearing aids would give me at least, [zangado], mais 1 ano antes de precisarmos considerar opções mais drásticas, [trémulo], para o meu trabalho. [pausa]
693. I know what I said 3 months ago, mas o dano nervoso está, [arrependido], a progredir mais rápido do que qualquer modelo previu e, pronto, precisamos de discutir o que isto significa para a tua carreira.
Character 1: [defensively] My entire life is built around capturing sound and image together, [perturbado], em perfeita harmonia e agora estás a dizer-me que os tratamentos que temos estado, [muito baixinho], a tentar há 2 anos de repente pararam completamente de funcionar. [suspiro]
694. [com empatia] Well, as your brother first and your audiologist second, percebo o quão devastador isto é, [chorando ao falar], especialmente quando o design de som tem sido a tua paixão desde a escola de cinema.
Character 1: Every project I've shot lately, os clientes continuam a perguntar porque é que o áudio parece, [confuso], desconectado dos visuais e eu não lhes posso dizer que é porque literalmente já não consigo ouvir o que estou a gravar, sabes?
695. [sussurrando] Lamento muito.
Character 1: [coldly] Sorry doesn't fix the fact, que tenho 3 casamentos marcados para o próximo mês que provavelmente, [derrotado], vou ter de cancelar. [gemido]
696. [hesitante] There are adaptive technologies, e sistemas de monitorização visual que te podem ajudar a continuar a trabalhar, embora eu saiba que não é o mesmo que confiar nos teus ouvidos.
Character 1: You're suggesting I become a videographer who can't actually, [trocista], ouvir os momentos que estou a capturar como os votos ou os, [exausto], discursos ou até a música que liga tudo emocionalmente, [desvanecendo], o que derrota completamente o propósito do que faço.
697. [formal] The cochlear implant consultation is scheduled for Thursday, mas preciso que entendas que mesmo com cirurgia os, [devagar], resultados variam significativamente e não há garantia de que vás recuperar a, [monótono], gama de frequências necessária para trabalho de áudio profissional. [tosse]
Character 1: [furioso] I've spent 15 years building my reputation, como alguém que captura as, [apaixonado], nuances de áudio subtis que outros videógrafos perdem e agora, estás basicamente a dizer-me que a minha carreira está, [very sadly], acabada.
698. [severo] You need to stop viewing this as just a career issue, quando a tua perda auditiva está a afetar a tua, [preocupado], capacidade de comunicar com pessoas e envolver-te com o, [melancólico], mundo à tua volta para além do trabalho, sabes?
Character 1: [apologético] You're right that I've been so focused on saving my business, que não, [aliviado], processei realmente o que isto significa para o resto da minha vida.
699. [alegre] There's a whole community of deaf and hard-of-hearing filmmakers, que adaptaram o seu ofício de formas, [animado], incríveis que tu ainda não consideraste.
Character 1: [curioso] Maybe I've been so terrified of losing what I had, que não consegui, [esperançoso], ver nenhuma possibilidade além disso. [riso]
700. [brincalhão] Remember when we were kids, e tu filmavas tudo com aquela câmara velha que tinha, [nostálgico], o áudio avariado mas ainda fazias aqueles filmes mudos incríveis apenas com, [excitedly], narrativa visual?
Character 1: Yeah, before I learned about sound design, eu era bastante bom a contar histórias através de, [confiante], imagem pura e talvez seja altura de redescobrir essa parte da, [pensativo], minha visão artística que ficou enterrada sob toda a perícia técnica de áudio, que pensei que me definia.
701. [sinceramente] As your brother who's watched you reinvent yourself before, não tenho dúvidas de que vais encontrar uma forma de criar algo, [orgulhoso], bonito desta perda mesmo que o caminho em frente pareça, [optimistic], completamente diferente do que imaginaste. [respiração profunda]
Character 1: Buáááááá, hum, buááá buááá, [chorando ao falar], baba ba ba, bem, gu gu, [perturbado], buáááááááá!
702. [confuso] Oh meu Deus, há aqui um bebé, [ansioso], como é que entraste aqui, [rapidamente], este edifício devia estar trancado!
Character 3: [choramingando] Ba ba ba ba, [voz trémula], mmmmmm mmmmmm, [frustrado], buáááááá! [fungando]
703. [caloroso] Pronto pronto, shh shh, não percebo nada de bebés mas, [hesitante], deixa-me pegar em ti, [gentilmente], por favor não chores mais.
Character 1: [soluçando] Gu gu, hmm, ba ba, [curioso], da da da, bem, sabes, [infantil], mmmmm ba ba ba ba, [feliz], gu gu ga ga! [ri baixinho]
704. Bem, hum, pareces mais contente agora que alguém está a, [aliviado], pegar em ti, quer dizer, embora eu devesse mesmo ligar a alguém sobre isto.
Character 1: [entusiasmado] Ba ba ba, hum, gu gu, [brincalhão], da da da da, bem, [muito animado], iiiiiiii, sabes, ba ba ba ba! [riso]
705. És mesmo, hum, até és giro quando não estás a, [falando sorrindo], gritar, quer dizer, mesmo que isto seja definitivamente, [constrangido], a noite mais estranha que já tive no trabalho.
Character 1: [sonolento] Mmmmm ba ba, [bocejo], gu gu ga ga.
706. Oh não, hum, não adormeças nos meus braços, quer dizer, [em pânico], ainda preciso de descobrir, [preocupado], de onde vieste! [suspiro]
Character 1: [resmungando] Ba ba, hmm, mmm mmm, [sonolento], gu gu, bem, [muito baixinho], da da, sabes, [exausto], mmmmmm. [suspiro suave]
707. [terno] Bem, hum, acho que os planos de desenvolvimento urbano podem, [devagar], esperar porque neste momento, ah, [com empatia], tu precisas mais de alguém do que este bairro precisa de mais um café. [risadinha]
Character 1: [satisfeito] Gu gu ga ga, [sereno], ba ba ba ba ba.
708. [apaixonadamente] Sabes que mais, pequenino, talvez encontrar-te aqui seja, [pensativo], um sinal de que esta comunidade precisa de mais do que apenas, [sincero], crescimento económico—precisa de lugares onde, [determinado], as famílias se sintam seguras o suficiente para nunca abandonarem os seus bebés. [pausa]
Character 1: [balbuciando] Da da da da, [alegre], ba ba ba, [animado], gu gu ga ga ba ba!
709. [formal] A polícia deve chegar em breve mas sinceramente, [arrependido], vou ter saudades tuas.
Character 1: Ba ba, hmm, gu gu, [sussurrando], da da, bem, mmmmm.
710. [muito sinceramente] Talvez isto seja estranho mas pegar em ti, [emocionado], fez-me lembrar porque é que entrei para o serviço público.
Character 1: Ahhhhh, hum, ba ba, [encantado], gu gu ga ga, sabes!
711. [agridoce] Aí está o carro da polícia, hum, hora de, [triste], dizer adeus pequenino, bem, [muito melancólico], espero que quem ficar contigo a seguir te ame como deve ser. [pausa longa]
Character 1: [frio] Bem, hum, eu sei exatamente quem tu és e, [pausa], o que fizeste à loja do meu primo na semana passada, portanto, ah, esta nota de 100 que acabaste de perder, [amargo], parece mesmo o karma a aparecer finalmente, sabes.
712. A loja do teu primo foi só negócios, [desafiador], nada pessoal, e tu ficares com a minha última nota de 100 não nos deixa quites.
Character 1: [determinado] É aí que te enganas porque, [zangado], isto não é sobre ficarmos quites, é sobre, [voz trémula], tu aprenderes que toda a ação tem consequências, e hoje, [frustrado], vais aprender essa lição da pior maneira.
713. [confiante] Achas que andar a fazer batota no jogo das copinhas te torna, [trocista], algum tipo de filósofo de rua a dar lições de vida a criminosos?
Character 1: [a rir] Pelo menos o meu esquema não envolve, [severo], apontar armas a pessoas inocentes que tentam ganhar a vida honestamente, [apaixonado], o que é mais do que posso dizer de ti e das tuas, [acelerando], visitas mascaradas à meia-noite.
714. Hum, sabes que mais, quer dizer, toda a gente neste bairro tem de sobreviver de alguma forma e, [baixinho], o teu primo não era tão inocente como pensas, é, ele andava a passar produto pela mercearia e, [hesitante], a tirar uma parte pra ele.
Character 1: [chocado] Mesmo que isso fosse verdade, que não é, [furioso], não tinhas o direito de aterrorizar a família dele, de obrigar os filhos dele, [voz embargando], a ver o pai a implorar por misericórdia.
715. [arrependido] Olha, hum, as coisas fugiram ao controlo naquela noite, [ansioso], mais do que eu planeava, e bem, nunca foi suposto os miúdos estarem lá, [sussurrando], deviam estar em casa da avó, percebes. [suspiro]
Character 1: Bem, hum, as intenções não significam muito quando 'tás, [amargo], a apontar uma arma carregada à cara de alguém, ou seja, é isso das nossas escolhas, elas importam.
716. [desesperado] Então, ah, e agora, vais chamar a polícia ou, [nervoso], vamos resolver isto à maneira da rua, porque, hum, de qualquer forma eu não saio daqui, [desvanecendo], sem o meu dinheiro de volta... [gemido]
Character 1: [firme] Continua a andar.
717. [ameaçador] Esta conversa não acabou e tu sabes disso, [alto], porque ninguém me tira nada sem pagar o preço, [lento], nem mesmo um batoteiro de meia-tigela com ressentimentos. [riso]
Character 1: Sabes qual é a diferença entre nós é que, [empático], eu dou às pessoas a escolha de jogar ou ir embora, mas tu, [enojado], tu simplesmente tiras o que queres sem te importares com quem magoas, [orgulhoso], e é por isso que vais sempre perder no fim. [tosse]
718. [contemplativo] Talvez tenhas razão sobre as escolhas, hum, mas aqui fora, [triste], às vezes parece que todas as escolhas são más, e, ah, estamos só a escolher de que maneira queremos falhar, sabes.
Character 1: [caloroso] Olha, quer dizer, há sempre outro caminho se tiveres, [sincero], vontade de o procurar, mas primeiro tens de, [esperançoso], parar de tomar atalhos através das vidas dos outros, e, hum, talvez começar por fazer as pazes com o meu primo, percebes. [pausa]
719. Fazer as pazes, é, bem, hum, isso é um jogo perigoso no nosso mundo, [cético], especialmente quando já queimaste tantas pontes, ou seja. [fungando]
Character 1: [determinado] Cada ponte que queimaste foi uma escolha que fizeste, [intenso], mas amanhã podes fazer novas escolhas, e talvez, [sincero], uma delas possa ser escolheres não ser o vilão na história de outra pessoa.
720. Tu acreditas mesmo que pessoas como nós podem mudar, [duvidoso], podem simplesmente decidir ser diferentes um dia e conseguir manter-se assim, [melancólico], porque eu já tentei antes e acabo sempre aqui outra vez, [exausto], a repetir os mesmos padrões de sempre. [bocejo]
Character 1: [gentil] A mudança não é sobre uma grande decisão, é sobre, [paciente], mil pequenas decisões todos os dias, escolher passar ao lado em vez de tirar, [encorajador], escolher ajudar em vez de magoar. [risadinha]
721. [resignado] Talvez não sejas só um batoteiro afinal, [pensativo], talvez sejas algo completamente diferente, e talvez, [baixo], eu precise de descobrir o que é que isso faz de mim.
