Scenario: angry because this is the fifth time they've called about the same issue

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I'm probably... I'm calling about my account again, I think it's still...

Customer Support [en]: Okay, let me just, hmm, pull up your information here. Can you give me your account number or, um, the phone number associated with the account so I can, uh, take a look at what's been happening?

Customer [en]: It's, uh, 555-0891. This is actually the fifth time I've called.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: I mean, I'm probably doing something wrong, but um, the billing just keeps... it won't...

Customer Support [en]: So I'm seeing here, um, your account number ACC-7739-QR22, and, hmm, okay so there's definitely a pattern of, uh, recurring issues with the automatic payment system. Let me see here... looks like you've spoken with, um, four different representatives about this?

Customer [en]: Yes, and I feel so stupid because maybe I just don't understand how to...

Customer Support [en]: No no no, you're not—this isn't on you at all. So looking at ticket TKT-889542-A, um, it seems like every time we've, uh, supposedly fixed it, the system just, hmm, reverts back after about 72 hours, which is, um, honestly pretty frustrating.

Customer [en]: Wait, so it's actually broken? I've been a customer for eight years.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, so, um, between you and me? This particular issue with reference code ERR-2847-BX is, uh, kind of ridiculous. We've had, hmm, at least thirty similar complaints this month alone, and, um, the technical team keeps saying it's fixed but clearly...

Customer [en]: Thirty people? And nobody's actually fixing this?

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know.

Customer [en]: This is, I mean, sort of unacceptable at this point, right?

Customer Support [en]: You're absolutely right, and, um, I'm going to do something different here. Let me, hmm, escalate this directly to our tier-three team with priority flag PRI-9982-HIGH, because, uh, having you call five times for the same issue is, um, completely unacceptable.

Customer [en]: I just... I don't know, maybe I should just cancel everything.

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, I completely understand that frustration. So here's what I'm thinking, um, while I process this escalation under case number ESC-4456-ZM91, I can also, uh, apply a service credit to your account for, hmm, let's see... three months worth of the inconvenience?

Customer [en]: Um, that's... I mean, I guess that's something, but will it actually get fixed?

Customer Support [en]: So, uh, honestly? With the escalation code I'm using, ESC-4456-ZM91-PRIORITY, um, they have to respond within 24 hours or it goes straight to, uh, executive support. And, hmm, I'm also adding notes that this is your fifth call, which, um, basically guarantees they'll actually look at it properly this time.

Customer [en]: Okay, I just... I'm tired of calling about this, you know?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely.
