=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so I've been with you guys for... eight years. And, uh, new customers get what, half off?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, hmm, let me just... okay so I'm pulling up your account here and, um, let me see here... account number ACC-4892-NJ91, and you're absolutely right, you've been—you've been with us since, wow, 2016, that's really... okay so, um, what I'm seeing is that you're referring to our, uh, our new customer promotion?

Customer [en]: That's what they all say... uh, yeah. The promotion.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so, um, I totally understand why that would be, you know, frustrating, because here's the thing—let me just, hmm, what's the best way to... okay so basically our new customer offers are, um, they're like a... what's the word... an acquisition thing? But but but I'm looking at your account ACC-4892-NJ91 and, um, I actually see some opportunities here that might, uh, might actually work better for you.

Customer [en]: Um, opportunities. Right. Er, what kind of...

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, so, um, here's what I'm going to do—and this is, uh, this is something I really want to make sure happens for you—I can see you're on plan code PLN-7700-X, and, hmm, let me think... there's actually a loyalty discount I can—I can apply retroactively that would, um, save you about forty-eight dollars per month going forward?

Customer [en]: They said that last time and then...

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, wait, you've—you've had issues with this before? Let me just, uh, let me check your case history here... hmm, okay so I see ticket number TKT-991204-B from, um, three months ago where someone promised... oh no, that's—that's not right, they didn't actually process that correctly, I'm so sorry.

Customer [en]: Uh, yeah. Exactly. So you see why I'm...

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, um, completely understand, and you know what? I'm—I'm going to personally make sure this gets fixed today, like, um, not just promise it but actually... let me do this right now while we're on the phone, okay? So so so I'm applying credit code CRD-8847-MV22, and, uh, that's going to show up immediately on your account.

Customer [en]: Um, how do I know it's actually... I mean, er...

Customer Support [en]: That's that's a really fair question, and, um, honestly after what happened last time, I'd be skeptical too, so hmm... what if I, uh, what if I send you the confirmation email right now while we're talking? Your email on file is still, um, let me see here... ends in gmail dot com, right?

Customer [en]: Yeah. Uh, just... tired of calling about this.

Customer Support [en]: I know I know, and, um, you shouldn't have to keep dealing with this, it's—it's really not fair to you, so let me just... okay confirmation number CNF-445892-RTK just went through, and, uh, I'm also going to put a note—a really detailed note—on your account so nobody can, um, mess this up again.

Customer [en]: Um, if you say so... what about next year when...

Customer Support [en]: Mmm yeah, so, um, that's actually—that's a really good point, because what often happens is, uh, these credits expire and then you're back to... hmm, let me think about how to... okay okay, so what I'm going to do is set up a, uh, a permanent adjustment under code ADJ-7712-PRM that doesn't—doesn't expire, it just stays on your account.

Customer [en]: Er, permanent. They all say permanent...

Customer Support [en]: Right. Totally hear you. Um, so so so here's the thing—I'm going to, uh, give you my direct extension, it's 4-4-7-2-9, and if this ever, um, if anything happens with this adjustment, you call me directly and I'll—I'll personally fix it, like I'm putting my name on this, reference number REF-20240115-KLM, that's tied to me specifically.

Customer [en]: Um, okay. I guess... uh, we'll see.

Customer Support [en]: And and and you know what? I'm also going to, um, schedule a follow-up for myself to check on this in, hmm, let's say thirty days? Just to make sure everything's, uh, everything's still applied correctly, because I really—I really want to make sure you don't have to deal with this again, your loyalty account LAC-4892-NJ91 deserves so much better than what you've been getting.
