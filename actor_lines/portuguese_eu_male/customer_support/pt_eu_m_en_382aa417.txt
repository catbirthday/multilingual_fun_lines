Scenario: valet attendant, nervous about a damage claim for a scratch that wasn't his fault

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, so I've been a customer for, let me see here... eight years? And now you're telling me I damaged a car?

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, eight years, that's—that's significant loyalty. I can see your account here, ACC-7891-DM, and um, there's a—what's the word—a damage claim filed yesterday for, uh, for a scratch incident?

Customer [en]: Hmm, okay so that means... wait, the scratch was already there! I documented it!

Customer Support [en]: You documented it? That's—no wait, actually—that's really good. Really good. Um, I'm looking at claim CLM-5502-XK91 and I don't—I don't see any prior damage notes yet but let me check—let me check another screen here.

Customer [en]: Um, I mean, like, I always take photos, you know? Always. Because this happens and, uh, it's not fair.

Customer Support [en]: No, you're right. Not fair at all. I've seen this—this kind of thing happen before and it's... frustrating. Really frustrating. Your photos should be under reference PHT-8823-NL if you uploaded them through our app?

Customer [en]: Let me think... yes! Through the app! Before I even moved the car!

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. Okay okay okay. So I'm—I'm pulling up the timeline for vehicle VEH-2234-QP and, um, hmm, there's a... what's the word... a discrepancy? Between when you clocked in at 2:14 PM and when the damage report was filed.

Customer [en]: Um, exactly! And, uh, listen, I've been doing this job for six years and I've never, like, NEVER had a claim!

Customer Support [en]: Six years with no claims—that's that's impressive. Really impressive. Looking at your profile, employee ID EMP-9087-TZ, you have, uh, perfect ratings actually.

Customer [en]: So why would I suddenly, um, you know, scratch a Tesla? It doesn't even make sense! And the owner, oh my god, let me tell you about this guy...

Customer Support [en]: Oh no. What—let me just—what happened with the owner?

Customer [en]: Um, he was already angry when he arrived, like, yelling about wait times and, uh, throwing his keys at me basically.

Customer Support [en]: Threw keys at you? That's—I mean—that's completely unacceptable. Um, I'm adding that to report RPT-6671-MK because that's, uh, that's relevant context here. Really relevant.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if... what if he's trying to blame old damage on me? Because I'm just the valet, right?

Customer Support [en]: You know what? I—no wait—I think you might be onto something there. The photos you took, timestamp TSP-4420-JH shows 2:16 PM, but the owner didn't report anything until, um, until 5:47 PM. That's that's a three hour gap.

Customer [en]: Um, exactly! Three hours! And, like, I parked it right in front where there's cameras!

Customer Support [en]: Cameras. Yes. Good good good. Security footage request SFR-7745-BC, I'm—I'm filing that right now. Um, between you and me? This claim is looking, uh, what's the word... questionable? Really questionable.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... you believe me? Because, um, I really can't afford to lose this job.

Customer Support [en]: I do. I absolutely do. Your case number is CSE-9981-WM and I'm—let me just—I'm escalating this to our fraud investigation team because, um, honestly? Eight years of loyalty, six years perfect valet record? We're we're going to fight this for you.
