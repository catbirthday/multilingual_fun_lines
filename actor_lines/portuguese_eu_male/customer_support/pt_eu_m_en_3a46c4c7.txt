Customer [en]: Um, hi there, I'm so, uh... let me see here... I really need help. So grateful someone picked up.

Customer Support [en]: Hey there! That's interesting, let me pull up... what's happening with verification?

Customer [en]: Right, okay so... hmm, I'm the, uh, athletic trainer? For State. And we're just... constantly moving.

Customer Support [en]: Oh that's... um, that's actually pretty unusual. So you're, uh, having trouble with the callbacks? Your account ID, er, would be starting with ATH-7264 if you're institutional...

Customer [en]: Yes! ATH... wait. Seven-two... six-four? That sounds right. You get it.

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, so, um, let me think here... you're traveling and, uh, missing our verification calls? That's... er, that's weird because we usually...

Customer [en]: Exactly. Thank you. Three weeks now. Bus. Hotel. Game. Bus. No chance.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, this is interesting... I'm seeing, uh, twelve attempted calls to your number ending in 8847? And they're all, er, during what looks like...

Customer [en]: Eight-eight-four... no. Seven. Four-seven. But yes. Twelve sounds right.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, um, 8847, sorry. So here's what's, uh, happening... the system's trying to reach you, um, between 2 and 4 PM Eastern, which is probably when you're...

Customer [en]: Oh! Hmm, that's... let me think... um, that's literally, uh, practice time. Every day. Always on field.

Customer Support [en]: That's the puzzle piece! Okay so... wait, this is actually fixable. Your verification code VRF-92847-TM just needs...

Customer [en]: Wait so... um, VRF-nine... hmm, what if I just... I don't, uh, really understand how...

Customer Support [en]: No no, you don't need that code. That's our side. Here's what we do... text verification instead. To that 8847 number.

Customer [en]: Oh my... um, you can DO that? That's so, uh... I mean, that's incredibly helpful. Really. Thank you.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah! Been doing this eight years. Athletic departments always have this issue. Let me just update your preference flag to TXT-ONLY...

Customer [en]: So specific. Um, I just... hmm, nobody else, uh, even understood the problem. You just... got it.

Customer Support [en]: There we go. Updated. You'll get a text in about... thirty seconds actually. Confirmation code CNF-44872-SP.

Customer [en]: Got it! Just came through. This is... perfect. Solved everything.

Customer Support [en]: Beautiful! That code's good for 72 hours. Even from the bus. We're all set here.
