Scenario: asking for help with a transaction that's stuck pending

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So. I think my payment's stuck? Probably been pending for... three days now.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull that up here and... can I get your, um, account number or the transaction reference?

Customer [en]: Sure. Sort of. TXN-4429-BK. I mean, that's what it says.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so, um, I'm seeing TXN-4429-BK here and, uh, yeah it's been in pending status since, hmm, Tuesday morning at 9:47 AM and basically what happened is...

Customer [en]: Let me guess. System error? Maybe technical difficulties?

Customer Support [en]: Actually, um, it's caught in our, uh, verification queue, so basically the system flagged it for manual review because, um, the amount was over the threshold for instant processing.

Customer [en]: Great. Perfect. I think that's... fantastic. Really.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know, it's, um, frustrating and like, honestly? I see this happen, uh, way too often with amounts over five hundred and, hmm, let me see if I can just...

Customer [en]: Ummm, so can you, like, maybe unstick it? Or is that, uh, probably asking too much?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, what I'm gonna do is, uh, submit an escalation ticket ESC-7901-MP right now and, er, normally they say forty-eight hours but, hmm, between you and me? If I mark it priority...

Customer [en]: That's what. The last person said. Sort of exactly that.

Customer Support [en]: Wait, you called before about this?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah? Yesterday? They said, uh, "escalation ticket." Probably the same speech.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, so, um, let me check the notes here and... oh. I see ticket ESC-7344-RD from yesterday but, uh, it wasn't... they didn't actually submit it correctly, it's just sitting in draft status which is...

Customer [en]: Of course. It is. Why would it be submitted.

Customer Support [en]: Listen, I'm, um, really sorry about this, like genuinely, this shouldn't... okay so, uh, I'm submitting a new one, ESC-7905-MP, right now, and um, I'm also adding my direct extension 4412 to your account notes.

Customer [en]: Uh-huh. And I should, what, probably believe this time?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I get why you're skeptical and, uh, honestly? Call me back at extension 4412 tomorrow if it's not resolved and I'll, um, personally walk it through to completion, like I'll literally stand over someone's shoulder if I have to.

Customer [en]: Huh. Okay. That's... I think that's actually different. Maybe.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, and um, just so you know, I'm putting a reminder in my calendar for tomorrow at 2 PM to check on TXN-4429-BK myself, so like, even if you don't call, I'm, uh, gonna follow up on this because... three days is ridiculous.
