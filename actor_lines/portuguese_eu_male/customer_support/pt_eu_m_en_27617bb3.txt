=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Look, I I just need these brackets. Um, they're they're not here.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, let me just—actually, hold on—I need to pull up your account first. Can you, uh, give me your order number or the account number for the practice?

Customer [en]: It's it's ACC-4982. Dr. Chen's office.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so I've got—um, wait, let me just—okay, account ACC-4982-DH, and I'm seeing here that, uh, your last shipment was marked delivered but you're saying the orthodontic brackets weren't included?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, exactly. We we only got half. Half!

Customer Support [en]: That's—I mean, I'm really sorry about that, um, let me check the manifest here for shipment SHP-7263-XK and, uh, oh—actually I think I see—no wait, let me just verify this.

Customer [en]: Can you just—I mean, um, the doctor's getting really really upset.

Customer Support [en]: I completely understand, and, um, I wish I had better news but the system's showing that order ORD-9847-TM only had twenty units authorized, not the forty you're expecting.

Customer [en]: No no no, that's wrong. We ordered forty. I I placed it myself.

Customer Support [en]: Um, so here's what I can—er, actually, hmm, let me dig deeper because I see there's a modification flag on this order from last Tuesday.

Customer [en]: Tuesday? Um, nobody changed anything Tuesday.

Customer Support [en]: Right, so, uh, I'm looking at the audit log here and—um, oh, this is strange—transaction TXN-892764-B shows an inventory adjustment but, er, I can't access the full details from my level.

Customer [en]: Your level? So so someone else could fix this?

Customer Support [en]: Well, I mean, technically yes but, um, I'm only able to process replacements up to a certain dollar amount and, uh, these specialty brackets are outside my authorization limit.

Customer [en]: I just—look, um, we have patients tomorrow. Kids kids with appointments.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, that's—I really, really wish I could just override this but, um, the system won't let me process anything over the threshold and, er, these are flagged as controlled inventory under code INV-8827-SP.

Customer [en]: Can I just, um, is there—could I talk to someone who who can?

Customer Support [en]: Of course, um, I can definitely escalate this to a supervisor but, uh, I should mention the wait might be about fifteen to twenty minutes right now.

Customer [en]: Fifteen—okay okay, um, I'll wait. I have to. The kids, they they need these.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, and, er, while I'm placing you in the queue for supervisor assistance, um, I'm adding priority flag PRF-7264 to your case so they'll have all the context about the missing brackets and tomorrow's appointments.
