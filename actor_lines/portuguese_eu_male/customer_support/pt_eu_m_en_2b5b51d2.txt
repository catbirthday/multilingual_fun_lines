=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I just—no wait—I need to, um, stop getting all these, uh, emails.

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so basically I can, um, absolutely help you with that, and uh, let me just pull up your account here real quick, so what I'll need is, er, your email address that's been getting these messages?

Customer [en]: Um, it's—wait let me—john dot harris at, uh, gmail.

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: Every morning. Six emails. I'm just... done.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah no I, um, I totally get that, so I'm looking at your profile JH-4492-EMAIL and, uh, wow you're subscribed to basically everything we've got, so let me just, er, start removing these, and like, I wish our system made this easier for you guys.

Customer [en]: Can we just—I want—actually, um, can you just kill all of it?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, so what I'm doing is, um, going through each category here, there's like promotions, newsletters, partner offers, and uh, your preference ID is PREF-8827-QX, so basically I'm just gonna, er, uncheck everything right now.

Customer [en]: Um, wait, how many—no actually—how many lists am I even on?

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay.

Customer [en]: That bad?

Customer Support [en]: So you're on, ummm, let me count here, so there's twelve main lists, and then, uh, about eight partner lists, which is, er, honestly ridiculous, and like I'm really sorry about this, your marketing profile MKT-3341-DL shows you've been opted in since, um, 2019.

Customer [en]: Funny thing is, um, I actually—wait—I like you guys. Just not, uh, this much.

Customer Support [en]: Right, so basically what happens is, um, our system just keeps adding you to new campaigns and, er, I'm looking at your suppression code now, SUP-7765-MK, and uh, I'm making sure this is permanent, so you won't get re-added later.

Customer [en]: Good. Quick question—no wait—will this, um, affect my account?

Customer Support [en]: So no, um, not at all, your account stays totally active, and uh, this just stops the marketing stuff, so basically your account number ACC-9912-TRX remains the same, um, you can still order, check orders, everything like that.

Customer [en]: Perfect. Um, honestly? You're making this, uh, pretty painless.

Customer Support [en]: Well so, um, I'm just about done here, and er, you should get a confirmation email to that gmail address with reference number CNF-4456-XP9, and uh, after that, like, you're free from our marketing department forever basically.

Customer [en]: Ha. Forever. I'll take it. Thanks—wait—um, seriously, thanks.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah so, um, you're all set, and like, I'm sorry you had to call for this, it should just be, er, one button on the website, but anyway your opt-out is confirmed, tracking number OPT-2234-FINAL, and uh, you have a good rest of your day.
