=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Look, I've tried three times to explain this. *exhales* We're seasonal. May through October.

Customer Support [en]: Right, right. I see your account here, number CMP-4782-QN, and I'm really sorry about the confusion with the billing cycles.

Customer [en]: It's not—wait, no—it's split billing. Summer rates. Then winter.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm seeing you're listed at 1847 Pine Ridge Road, Site 12, and there's definitely something off with how the seasonal rates got applied.

Customer [en]: *sharp inhale* Finally. Someone gets it. So basically we close November first.

Customer Support [en]: I'm really sorry this has been such a hassle. Looking at your account, the system charged you the full $89.50 winter rate when it should've prorated to just $22.38.

Customer [en]: Twenty-two thirty-eight. Yes. That's right. See, I knew the math.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, you had it right all along. I can process that credit right now, and honestly I'm embarrassed it took this many calls to fix it.

Customer [en]: *exhales* Sorry I was sharp. Just tired. Eighty-one years old, you know?

Customer Support [en]: No no, please don't apologize! You've been incredibly patient. I'm getting you that $67.12 credit applied, reference number REF-9823-XM.

Customer [en]: You're sweet. New at this?

Customer Support [en]: Um, actually yes! Three weeks. Is it that obvious? I'm trying to be thorough but sometimes I think I overexplain everything.

Customer [en]: No, no. You're doing fine. Better than the last ones.

Customer Support [en]: That's really kind of you to say. So for next season, I've added a note—huge note actually—that you're seasonal May 1st through October 31st.

Customer [en]: Good. Yes. And the deposit carries?

Customer Support [en]: It does! Your $200 deposit stays active, and when you reopen in May, you'll just get billed the summer rate of $45.00 monthly.

Customer [en]: Forty-five. Right. Sorry for the fuss earlier. Long day.

Customer Support [en]: Please, you were completely justified! Three calls is... well, it's not acceptable. I've documented everything under case number CSE-7734-PP.

Customer [en]: You're good at this. Don't doubt yourself.

Customer Support [en]: That really means a lot. Thank you. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the campground account today?
