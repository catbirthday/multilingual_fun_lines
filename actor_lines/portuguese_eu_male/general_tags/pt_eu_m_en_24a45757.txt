Scenario: A wounded outlaw collapses on a beach at dawn where a lifeguard is doing their morning rounds, begging for help while refusing to go to a hospital.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [alarmed] Hey, hey, don't move! You're bleeding pretty badly there—I need to call 911 and get you to a hospital right now before this gets worse.

Character 2 [en]: [gasping] No hospitals, please, I can't—they'll ask questions I can't answer. Just need to rest for a minute, catch my breath, then I'll be gone.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Listen, I've been a lifeguard for eight years and that's a gunshot wound, not a fishing accident. You need proper medical attention or you're going to bleed out on my beach.

Character 2 [en]: Your beach? [weak laugh] That's funny, thinking you own the sand and the sunrise. Look, I know what this looks like, but there are worse things than dying.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] What could possibly be worse than bleeding to death at dawn while the seagulls watch? Help me understand why I shouldn't be saving your life right now.

Character 2 [en]: [struggling] You ever have people depending on you? Not just wanting you around, but actually needing you to stay silent so they stay alive?

Character 1 [en]: [kneeling down] I'm going to apply pressure to that wound whether you like it or not, because that's what I do—I save people, even the ones who don't want saving.

Character 2 [en]: You're stubborn for someone who watches waves all day. [winces] Fine, but no ambulances, no cops, and if anyone asks, you never saw me.

Character 1 [en]: There's a first aid station about fifty yards behind us with supplies that could buy you time. Can you walk if I support you?

Character 2 [en]: [weakly] Maybe.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Here's what's going to happen—I'm going to patch you up best I can, give you water, and then you're going to tell me who did this.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] That's not part of the deal. You said you save people without asking questions, remember? [coughs] That's what makes you different from cops.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] I'm not asking as a cop, I'm asking as someone who's watching you choose death over a hospital, and that tells me someone scarier than death is after you.

Character 2 [en]: You really want to know? There's a reason I ended up on this particular beach at this particular time, and it wasn't random.

Character 1 [en]: [protective] Whatever trouble you're in, we can figure something out. My cousin's a lawyer, my brother works border patrol—there are legal ways to protect yourself.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter laugh] Legal ways. That's rich coming from someone who doesn't know what it's like when the law itself is bought and paid for.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Try me.

Character 2 [en]: You know Detective Morrison from the fifth precinct? The one who got that community service award last month? [pauses] He's the one who put this bullet in me.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Jesus. Okay, new plan—my place is two miles up the coast, completely off the grid, solar panels and everything. No one would think to look there.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful whisper] Why would you risk that for someone like me? You don't even know what I've done, who I really am.
