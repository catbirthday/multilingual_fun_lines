=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [professional] Look, um, I'm here from Apex Financial Recovery and, [uncomfortable], we need to discuss the three months of defaulted payments on, [clearing throat], your studio equipment leases, so, uh, I'll need to start cataloging what needs to be, [firm], repossessed today.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, uh, that voice—Marcus, umm, is that really, [disbelieving], you standing there with a clipboard talking about taking my gear? [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Jesus, um, Danny, I didn't—I mean, the paperwork just said, [swallowing hard], D.R. Productions, not your actual name, and, well, I never imagined you'd, [voice cracking], still be doing music after everything that, umm, went down.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Still doing music—that's, [incredulous], rich coming from the guy who said I was, [angry], wasting my life chasing a pipe dream when you walked out on, [trembling], our band fifteen years ago.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Well, I mean, I had responsibilities, Danny—my kid was on the way and, [frustrated], playing dive bars for beer money wasn't exactly, umm, sustainable. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [heated] Responsibilities—you think I didn't have, [accusatory], responsibilities too when my dad got sick and I still showed up to, [breaking], every single rehearsal while you were already mentally, [disgusted], checking out?

Character 1 [en]: [guilty] That's not how it was and you, [voice shaking], know it—I tried to keep us together but you wanted to sign that, [desperate], ridiculous contract that would've owned us for, [exhausted], ten years. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [cold] That ridiculous contract would've put us on, [measured], tour with The Velvet Ghosts—do you have any idea where they are now?

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Yeah, um, I know exactly where they are because I, [pained], see their platinum albums every time I walk into, well, any record store.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So, umm, what—you just, [confused], gave it all up to become a repo man, I mean, is this really what Marcus the songwriter became?

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, repo man is a bit harsh but yeah, I, [tired], collect debts because it pays for my daughter's college and my ex-wife's alimony, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Um, divorced? [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] Yeah, uh, turns out giving up your dreams for someone else doesn't, [bitter], guarantee they'll stick around anyway, so, um, here I am, [hollow], taking away other people's dreams now.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Marcus, those demos we recorded in my garage are still, [emotional], the best work I've ever done—nothing I've produced since has come, [wistful], close to what we had. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] I, um, still have them too, all of them on, [nostalgic], cassette tapes in a box I can't bring myself to throw away even though I don't, [sad], own a tape player anymore, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Look, I've got session musicians coming in an hour to work on, [building excitement], a track that needs exactly the kind of, [intense], bass line you used to write in your sleep—what if we could, [pleading], figure something out?

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] Danny, I have a quota to meet and my boss is, [stressed], already breathing down my neck about this account.

Character 2 [en]: But what if, um, I could pay half right now and, [desperate], we work out a deal where you help me finish this album—I mean, [calculating], your commission plus production credits could cover, [hopeful], way more than what I owe. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [considering] You're seriously asking me to, um, risk my job to play music with the guy who, [incredulous], called me a sellout coward the last time we spoke, and, well, somehow that's still the best, [amazed], offer I've had in fifteen years, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [earnest] Well, umm, maybe we were both right and both wrong, and, [determined], maybe it's not too late to find out what we could've, um, been. [pause]
