Scenario: A community supervision officer arrives at a poultry processing plant to check on a parolee who hasn't shown up for work in three days, only to discover the worker has been secretly living in the facility's storage area after losing their housing.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [official] Marcus Thompson hasn't reported for work in 3 days, e o supervisor dele diz, [concerned], que ele tem andado estranho ultimamente, por isso, bem, preciso de saber se alguém, [careful], o viu por aqui hoje nas instalações.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Well, I've been working double shifts all week, e, [nervous], o pessoal do turno da noite mantém-se mais na deles, mas quer dizer, [hesitant], talvez tenha visto alguém na área de refrigeração depois de, [trailing off], todos os outros terem ido para casa. [clears throat]

Character 1 [mix]: [suspicious] The cold storage area isn't supposed to be accessed after hours, [direct], sem autorização do supervisor, por isso quem é que tu, [pressing], viste lá exactamente?

Character 2 [mix]: Marcus has been sleeping in the old equipment room, [quiet], atrás dos congeladores porque o senhorio dele, [sympathetic], despejou-o na semana passada e ele não queria, [breaking], violar a condicional por faltar ao trabalho.

Character 1 [mix]: [stunned] You're telling me he's been living in a meat processing plant, hum, há uma semana em vez de, [disbelief], reportar a situação habitacional dele para mim? [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [mix]: [protective] He was terrified you'd send him back to prison, [emphatic], por estar sem-abrigo quando tudo o que ele está a tentar fazer é, [desperate], manter este emprego e manter-se limpo, o que tem feito há, [proud], 8 meses agora.

Character 1 [mix]: [softly] Take me to him, leva-me até ele.

Character 2 [mix]: [reluctant] Look, I could lose my job for letting him stay here, [worried], e, bem, tenho 3 filhos para alimentar, mas quer dizer, [conflicted], ele já passou por tanto, sabes?

Character 1 [mix]: I'm not here to arrest him or get you fired, [measured], estou aqui para o ajudar a encontrar habitação adequada antes que esta, [urgent], situação piore.

Character 2 [mix]: [surprised] Um, a sério?

Character 1 [mix]: [genuine] There are transitional housing programs he qualifies for, que eu devia ter, [regretful], ligado para ele há meses atrás em vez de apenas preencher, [frustrated], formulários de conformidade.

Character 2 [mix]: [relieved] He's been showering in the employee locker room at 4 in the morning, [embarrassed], e lava o uniforme dele nas, [sad], pias industriais todas as noites.

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] Well, that ends today, porque vou ligar para a casa de transição na Riverside, [resolute], agora mesmo. [pauses]

Character 2 [mix]: [hopeful] They have space available, e, hum, eu sei porque, [emotional], o meu irmão ficou lá depois da libertação dele, e, bem, eles realmente preocupam-se em ajudar as pessoas, [warming], a reconstruir as suas vidas, sabes, não só armazená-las.

Character 1 [mix]: [professional] I need you to take me to Marcus right now, hum, para podermos, [gentle], levá-lo para um sítio seguro, e, bem, prometo que nenhum de vocês vai enfrentar, [reassuring], consequências negativas por isto.

Character 2 [mix]: [grateful] He's probably in the break room right now, porque, [knowing], ele sempre faz café para o turno da manhã mesmo não sendo, [touched], suposto ele estar aqui até ao meio-dia, que é mesmo, [admiring], o tipo de pessoa que ele é.

Character 1 [mix]: [reflective] Sometimes the system makes it harder for people to succeed than fail, [bitter], e o Marcus merece melhor do que dormir ao lado de, [heavy], carcaças de frango congeladas. [sighs]

Character 2 [mix]: Follow me then, segue-me então.

Character 1 [mix]: [resolved] After we get him situated, quero falar sobre, [interested], implementar uma rede de apoio habitacional para outros trabalhadores aqui que possam estar, [thoughtful], com dificuldades. [decisive]

Character 2 [mix]: That would mean everything to the people here, porque, [emotional], metade de nós está a um salário de distância de estar na situação do Marcus, [voice breaking], nós próprios, e, bem, saber que alguém realmente se importa seria, [hopeful], mudar tudo.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [official] Marcus Thompson hasn't reported for work in, um, three days and his supervisor says, [concerned], he's been acting strange lately, so, well, I need to know if anyone's, [careful], seen him around the facility today.

Character 2: [defensive] Well, um, I've been working double shifts all week and, [nervous], the night crew keeps to themselves mostly, but I mean, [hesitant], I might've seen someone in the cold storage area after, [trailing off], everyone else went home. [clears throat]

Character 1: [suspicious] The cold storage area isn't supposed to be, [direct], accessed after hours without supervisor approval, so who exactly did you, [pressing], see back there?

Character 2: Marcus has been sleeping in the, [quiet], old equipment room behind the freezers because his landlord, [sympathetic], evicted him last week and he didn't want to, [breaking], violate his parole by missing work.

Character 1: [stunned] You're telling me he's been, um, living in a meat processing plant for, [disbelief], a week rather than, well, reporting his housing situation to me? [sighs heavily]

Character 2: [protective] He was terrified you'd send him, [emphatic], back to prison for being homeless when all he's trying to do is, [desperate], keep this job and stay clean, which he has been for, [proud], eight months now.

Character 1: [softly] Take me to him.

Character 2: [reluctant] Look, um, I could lose my job for, [worried], letting him stay here, and, well, I've got three kids to feed, but I mean, [conflicted], he's been through enough already, you know?

Character 1: I'm not here to arrest him or get you, [measured], fired, I'm here to help him find proper housing before this, [urgent], situation gets worse.

Character 2: [surprised] Um, really?

Character 1: [genuine] There are transitional housing programs he qualifies for that I should've, [regretful], connected him with months ago instead of just checking, [frustrated], boxes on compliance forms.

Character 2: [relieved] He's been showering in the employee locker room at, [embarrassed], four in the morning and washing his uniform in the, [sad], industrial sinks every night.

Character 1: [determined] Well, um, that ends today because I'm calling the halfway house on Riverside, [resolute], right now. [pauses]

Character 2: [hopeful] They have space available, and, um, I know because, [emotional], my brother stayed there after his release, and, well, they actually care about helping people, [warming], rebuild their lives, you know, not just warehousing them.

Character 1: [professional] I need you to take me to Marcus, um, right now so we can, [gentle], get him somewhere safe, and, well, I promise neither of you will face any, [reassuring], negative consequences for this.

Character 2: [grateful] He's probably in the break room right now because, [knowing], he always makes coffee for the morning shift even though he's not, [touched], supposed to be here until noon, which is just, [admiring], the kind of person he is.

Character 1: [reflective] Sometimes the system makes it harder for people to, [bitter], succeed than fail, and Marcus deserves better than sleeping next to, [heavy], frozen chicken carcasses. [sighs]

Character 2: Follow me then.

Character 1: [resolved] After we get him situated, I want to talk about, [interested], implementing a housing support network for other workers here who might be, [thoughtful], struggling. [decisive]

Character 2: That would mean, um, everything to the people here because, [emotional], half of us are one paycheck away from being in Marcus's, [voice breaking], situation ourselves, and, well, knowing someone actually gives a damn would, [hopeful], change everything.
