=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The disability paperwork came through today, which means you're officially retired at fifty-four, and I don't know how to process that you'll never go back to the office again. [exhales heavily]

Character 2 [en]: Please don't look at me like I'm already dead, because that's exactly what your face is doing right now, and it's making this harder than it needs to be.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] I'm not looking at you like that, I'm just trying to understand how we went from planning your promotion last month to clearing out your desk yesterday.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter laugh] The doctors say my hands won't get better, that the tremors are permanent, so thirty-two years of being a surgeon just ended with a signature on some forms.

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] You're still the same person, the same brilliant mind who saved hundreds of lives, and that doesn't disappear just because your hands can't hold a scalpel anymore.

Character 2 [en]: Except it does disappear, because who am I if I'm not operating, not teaching residents, not being paged at three in the morning for emergencies? [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You're my partner, you're still a doctor with decades of knowledge, and maybe this is a chance to find parts of yourself you buried under all those eighteen-hour shifts.

Character 2 [en]: [withdrawing] I don't want to find new parts of myself, I want my old life back where I had purpose and respect, not this forced retirement where I'm just another medical statistic.

Character 1 [en]: The respect hasn't gone anywhere, and neither has your purpose, it just needs to shift into something your body can actually sustain without destroying itself further.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You make it sound so simple, like I can just flip a switch and be happy about losing everything I worked for since medical school.

Character 1 [en]: [steadier] I know it's not simple, but watching you fade away these past three months has been terrifying, and at least now we can stop pretending the tremors aren't getting worse.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] They are worse.

Character 1 [en]: Which is exactly why we need to accept this new reality instead of fighting it, because denial won't bring back your steadiness or make the symptoms disappear.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] The pension covers seventy percent of my salary, so financially we'll manage, but emotionally I feel like I'm drowning in all this sudden empty time.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Then we'll fill that time together, starting with that trip to Barcelona you've been postponing for fifteen years because surgery always came first.

Character 2 [en]: [softening slightly] Barcelona does sound nice, though I'll probably spend the whole time reading medical journals out of habit, assuming my hands can still hold the tablet steady enough.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe you could dictate articles instead of reading them, or consult remotely on cases, finding ways to stay connected without the physical demands.

Character 2 [en]: [considering] The hospital did mention keeping me on as an advisory consultant, though it feels like a consolation prize compared to actually being in the operating room.

Character 1 [en]: [gently firm] It's not a consolation prize, it's an evolution, and you've always been too stubborn to see that change doesn't automatically mean failure.

Character 2 [en]: You're right that I'm stubborn, but thirty-two years of identity doesn't just dissolve because my body betrayed me, though I suppose we'll figure it out together. [sighs]
