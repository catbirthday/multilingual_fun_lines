=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitant] So, um, I was reviewing the latest, [tense], sequências de previz que mandaste e, bem, reparei que tens estado a, [careful], mudar coisas que não eram suposto, [controlled], mudar, quer dizer, elementos narrativos bastante significativos.

Character 2 [mix]: The changes I made were purely, [defensive], melhorias técnicas para ajudar a narrativa a fluir melhor visualmente.

Character 1 [mix]: Technical improvements don't involve, [sharp], reescrever os diálogos do meu filho ou mudar por quem a personagem principal se apaixona.

Character 2 [mix]: Look, um, I understand this is, [uncomfortable], emocionalmente difícil para ti, mas, bem, às vezes o que funciona no papel não, [measured], se traduz para o ecrã, e quer dizer, como profissional, tenho de tomar, [firm], essas decisões.

Character 1 [mix]: [controlling] Well, um, the thing is, [stern], tu não podes tomar essas decisões porque isto não é a tua história. [sighs]

Character 2 [mix]: [quiet] I've been working on this project for, um, 6 meses agora, e quer dizer, [invested], despejei tudo para torná-lo bonito, para, [passionate], fazer algo que honrasse a visão dele enquanto também, bem, funcionasse mesmo como filme. [pauses]

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] You know, um, he spent three years writing this, e tipo, [breaking], cada personagem, cada ponto da trama, tudo significava algo para ele, e, bem, [fierce], estás a apagar pedaços de quem ele era.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Um, well, isso não é justo.

Character 1 [mix]: The studio hired you to visualize, [pointed], a história dele, não para reescrevê-la porque achas que sabes, [bitter], melhor que um jovem de 22 anos morto que não pode defender o seu trabalho, [cracking], não pode explicar porque é que as coisas importavam.

Character 2 [mix]: [steady] Listen, I respect what you're going through, mas, [professional], este filme precisa de chegar ao público, precisa de, [pragmatic], ter sucesso comercial ou nunca verá a luz do dia.

Character 1 [mix]: [cold] Commercial success wasn't what he cared about, e se, [disgusted], tivesses mesmo lido as notas dele em vez de só passar os olhos, compreenderias que as escolhas não convencionais, [heated], eram o objetivo todo.

Character 2 [mix]: [frustrated] I did read his notes, todas elas, [conflicted], várias vezes na verdade, e são brilhantes mas, [hesitant], também estão incompletas.

Character 1 [mix]: [whispered] Of course they're incomplete.

Character 2 [mix]: [gentle] Look, I mean, um, maybe we could work together on this, encontrar uma maneira de, [hopeful], preservar o que importa mais enquanto ainda, bem, fazemos algo que possa existir no mundo.

Character 1 [mix]: What matters most is that, [weary], quando as pessoas virem o nome dele nos créditos, estão a ver, [firm], a visão dele, não a tua a usar a cara dele como uma máscara.

Character 2 [mix]: You're right that, um, I've been making decisions I shouldn't have made alone, e, [regretful], talvez tenha ficado demasiado preso no meu próprio, [trailing], processo criativo, em querer, bem, fazer algo perfeito.

Character 1 [mix]: [exhausted] Perfect. [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [mix]: So, um, what if we went through every change together, quer dizer, linha por linha, [sincere], cena por cena?

Character 1 [mix]: [resigned] He wrote in his journal that unfinished art is still art, que, [soft], a imperfeição era mais honesta que o polimento, e aqui estamos, [broken], a polir tudo o que fazia dele ser dele.

Character 2 [mix]: [quiet] Then let's stop polishing and start, [determined], preservar o que realmente está lá, mesmo as arestas.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [hesitant] So, um, I was reviewing the latest, [tense], previz sequences you sent and, well, I noticed you've been, [careful], changing things that weren't supposed to be, [controlled], changed, I mean, pretty significant story elements.

Character 2: The changes I made were purely, [defensive], technical improvements to help the narrative flow better visually.

Character 1: Technical improvements don't involve, [sharp], rewriting my son's dialogue or changing who the main character falls in love with.

Character 2: Look, um, I understand this is, [uncomfortable], emotionally difficult for you, but, well, sometimes what works on paper doesn't, [measured], translate to screen, and I mean, as a professional, I have to make, [firm], those calls.

Character 1: [controlling] Well, um, the thing is, [stern], you don't get to make those calls because this isn't your story. [sighs]

Character 2: [quiet] I've been working on this project for, um, six months now, and I mean, [invested], I've poured everything into making it beautiful, into, [passionate], making it something that would honor his vision while also, well, actually working as a film. [pauses]

Character 1: [trembling] You know, um, he spent three years writing this, and like, [breaking], every single character, every plot point, it all meant something to him, and, well, [fierce], you're erasing pieces of who he was.

Character 2: [defensive] Um, well, that's not fair.

Character 1: The studio hired you to visualize, [pointed], his story, not to rewrite it because you think you know, [bitter], better than a dead twenty-two-year-old who can't defend his work anymore, [cracking], can't explain why things mattered.

Character 2: [steady] Listen, I respect what you're going through, but, [professional], this film needs to reach audiences, needs to, [pragmatic], succeed commercially or it'll never see the light of day.

Character 1: [cold] Commercial success wasn't what he cared about, and if, [disgusted], you'd actually read his notes instead of just skimming them, you'd understand that the unconventional choices, [heated], were the entire point.

Character 2: [frustrated] I did read his notes, every single one of them, [conflicted], multiple times actually, and they're brilliant but, [hesitant], they're also incomplete.

Character 1: [whispered] Of course they're incomplete.

Character 2: [gentle] Look, I mean, um, maybe we could work together on this, find a way to, [hopeful], preserve what matters most while still, well, making something that can exist in the world.

Character 1: What matters most is that, [weary], when people see his name in the credits, they're seeing, [firm], his vision, not yours wearing his face like a mask.

Character 2: You're right that, um, I've been making decisions I shouldn't have made alone, and, [regretful], maybe I got too caught up in my own, [trailing], creative process, in wanting to, well, make something perfect.

Character 1: [exhausted] Perfect. [laughs bitterly]

Character 2: So, um, what if we went through every change together, I mean, line by line, [sincere], scene by scene?

Character 1: [resigned] He wrote in his journal that unfinished art is still art, that, [soft], imperfection was more honest than polish, and here we are, [broken], polishing away everything that made it his.

Character 2: [quiet] Then let's stop polishing and start, [determined], preserving what's actually there, even the rough edges.
