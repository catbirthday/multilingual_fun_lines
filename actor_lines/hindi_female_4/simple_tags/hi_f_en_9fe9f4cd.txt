Scenario: A mediator arrives at a remote research facility to negotiate between a trailblazing scientist who refuses to halt dangerous experiments and the investors threatening to pull funding.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [calmly] Dr. Chen, I understand you've locked yourself in the lab for the past seventy-two hours, and the board is genuinely concerned about both your wellbeing and the direction of this research. [pause] They sent me here to find a middle ground that works for everyone.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] Middle ground? We're on the verge of revolutionizing neural interface technology and they want to talk about middle ground? [laughs] I've spent eight years getting to this point, sacrificing everything, and now that we're finally seeing results, they get cold feet.

Character 1 [en]: [patiently] The concern isn't about the results themselves, it's about the methodology you're using to achieve them. [sighs] Testing on yourself without proper safety protocols violates every agreement you signed when they funded this facility.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Those agreements were written by people who've never pushed a single boundary in their lives! [firmly] Every major breakthrough in science required someone willing to take the first leap—Marie Curie carried radioactive materials in her pockets, for God's sake.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] And she died from radiation exposure, which is exactly the kind of outcome the board wants to prevent here. [warmly] Look, nobody's questioning your brilliance or dedication, but there has to be a way to continue this work without putting yourself at risk.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] You don't understand.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Then help me understand, because from where I'm sitting, it looks like you're one failed experiment away from either permanent brain damage or creating something that could harm thousands of people if it gets out of control.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] The neural pathways I'm mapping can only be properly calibrated through direct experience—no simulation, no animal model can replicate human consciousness. [exhales] If I stop now, someone else will pick up where I left off, but they'll do it wrong, they'll cut corners in ways that actually are dangerous.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtfully] So you're saying this is about protecting the integrity of the research as much as achieving the breakthrough? [pause] That's actually something I think the board might be willing to hear, if we frame it correctly.

Character 2 [en]: Frame it however you want, but I'm not stopping the trials. [determined] We're three sessions away from establishing permanent bidirectional communication between human and artificial neural networks—do you understand what that means for paralyzed patients, for locked-in syndrome?

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] I do understand, and that's why I'm here trying to find a solution instead of just pulling your funding. [sincerely] What if we brought in an independent safety team, people you choose, who monitor each session but don't interfere unless absolutely necessary?

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Independent team means more variables, more chances for contamination of the data. [sighs] But if that's what it takes to keep them from shutting us down completely, I might consider it—emphasis on might.

Character 1 [en]: It's a start, and that's more than the board expected when they sent me here. [relieved] Now, can we talk about documenting your current protocols so that if something does happen, your work isn't lost?

Character 2 [en]: Documentation implies I'm planning for failure, which I'm not. [pause] But fine, I'll record everything—video, neural scans, the complete data streams—on one condition.

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] I'm listening, though I should warn you that my ability to negotiate terms has limits, especially when it comes to anything that could increase liability or risk.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] No limits.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] I'm sorry, no limits on what exactly? Because if you're asking for unlimited funding or complete autonomy, that's simply not something I can deliver, no matter how much I might sympathize with your position.

Character 2 [en]: No limits on where this technology goes once we prove it works. [passionate] The board wants to patent it, lock it down, sell it to the highest bidder—I want it open-sourced, available to every researcher, every patient who needs it.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] That's a massive ask, Dr. Chen, essentially asking them to give up billions in potential revenue for the greater good. [thoughtfully] But if we structure it as a phased release, maybe exclusive rights for two years to recoup investment, then gradual open-sourcing...

Character 2 [en]: [hopefully] You could actually make that happen? [laughs] Because if you can sell them on that, I'll wear whatever safety equipment they want, follow every protocol, even let them film a documentary about the whole thing if it helps. [pause] This was never about money for me.
