=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [warm] आपकी बेटी की ऊर्जा इस कमरे में बहुत तेज़ है अभी, मैं उसकी उपस्थिति महसूस कर सकती हूं आपके बाएं कंधे के पीछे। [quietly] वो चाहती है कि आप जानें कि अब वो तकलीफ में नहीं है, the pain from the accident is completely gone.

Character 2 [mix]: [shaky voice] आपको कैसे पता कि ये एक्सीडेंट था? [pause] मैंने अपॉइंटमेंट बुक करते वक्त ये नहीं बताया था, I just said I lost someone.

Character 1 [mix]: [confidently] आत्माएं सब कुछ बता देती हैं उन्हें जो सुनना जानती हैं, and she's showing me water, lots of water. [hesitantly] क्या शायद कोई पूल या समुद्र से जुड़ी बात थी?

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] ये कार क्रैश था। [sighs]

Character 1 [mix]: [quickly] हां, बारिश।

Character 2 [mix]: [frustrated] उस दिन बारिश नहीं थी, it was the middle of July during a drought, सड़कें बिल्कुल सूखी थीं। [very quietly] मुझे याद है क्योंकि मैं सोचती रही कि आसमान कितना नीला था जब हम एम्बुलेंस का इंतज़ार कर रहे थे।

Character 1 [mix]: [empathetically] कभी-कभी आध्यात्मिक जगत में डिटेल्स मिक्स हो जाती हैं, but what matters is the message of love she's sending. [clearing throat] वो मुझे एक खास खिलौने के बारे में बता रही है, something soft that she used to carry everywhere.

Character 2 [mix]: [exhausted] हर बच्चे के पास कोई स्टफ्ड एनिमल होता है जिससे वो प्यार करता है, that's not exactly a revelation from beyond. [pause] देखिए, मैं यहां आई थी क्योंकि मेरी बहन ने ज़िद की थी कि शायद ये दुःख से निपटने में मदद करे, but this is starting to feel wrong.

Character 1 [mix]: वो मुझे M अक्षर दिखा रही है, कोई महत्वपूर्ण व्यक्ति जिसका नाम M से शुरू होता है, maybe Mary or Michael, कोई जो आप दोनों के लिए बहुत मायने रखता था। [anxious] इस व्यक्ति को आपसे सुनने की ज़रूरत है।

Character 2 [mix]: उसका नाम मिया था, मेरी बेटी का नाम मिया था, and you're fishing for information like every other charlatan I've wasted money on. [angry] आपको उसका नाम भी नहीं पता।

Character 1 [mix]: [apologetic] बिल्कुल, मिया, यही तो मैं महसूस कर रही थी, she's right here telling me her name. [quickly] कभी-कभी कनेक्शन को क्लियर होने में टाइम लगता है, but now I can hear her voice so clearly, और वो कुछ गा रही है, शायद कोई लोरी।

Character 2 [mix]: [crying while speaking] वो जन्म से बहरी थी, she never heard music, एक सुर भी नहीं गाया कभी। [loudly] हमने साथ में साइन लैंग्वेज सीखी, सालों तक हाथों से बात करते रहे, and you're telling me she's singing to you?

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] आत्मा की दुनिया में, शरीर की सारी सीमाएं खत्म हो जाती हैं, she can hear and speak now. [trailing off] ये उस पार जाने का एक खूबसूरत तोहफा है, all the things she couldn't do here...

Character 2 [mix]: [furious] उसके बहरेपन को ऐसे मत दिखाइए जैसे वो कोई ठीक करने वाली चीज़ थी। [shouting] वो बिल्कुल परफेक्ट थी जैसी थी, and we had our own beautiful language that you could never understand!

Character 1 [mix]: मैं समझती हूं कि आप गुस्से में हैं, grief manifests in many ways, और कभी-कभी लोग उस पार से संदेश लेने के लिए तैयार नहीं होते। [sigh] शायद हमें थोड़ा ब्रेक लेना चाहिए।

Character 2 [mix]: नहीं, हम यहीं खत्म कर रहे हैं पूरी तरह से, and I want my three hundred dollars back immediately. [bitter] आप लोगों को उनके सबसे बुरे वक्त में शिकार बनाती हैं, when they'd give anything for just one more minute with someone they love.

Character 1 [mix]: [formal] सेशन फीस नॉन-रिफंडेबल है जैसा कि आपने साइन किए एग्रीमेंट में लिखा था, but I genuinely believe if you'd open your heart, आप मिया की उपस्थिति यहां महसूस करेंगी। [quietly] वो नहीं चाहती कि आप इस तरह जाएं।

Character 2 [mix]: [withering] पता है सबसे क्रूर बात क्या है? [pause] बस एक सेकंड के लिए जब आपने शुरू किया था, मैंने खुद को उम्मीद करने दी थी कि शायद कहीं आप सच्ची हैं, that maybe I could tell her I'm sorry for looking at my phone जब वो ट्रक ने रेड लाइट तोड़ी।

Character 1 [mix]: वो आपको माफ़ करती है।

Character 2 [mix]: [very quietly] वो यहां नहीं है मुझे माफ़ करने के लिए, वो बस चली गई है, and you're just another liar making money from that truth. [long pause] मैं अपनी क्रेडिट कार्ड कंपनी को कॉल करके चार्ज डिस्प्यूट करूंगी, and I'm posting reviews on every site I can find. [exhausted] शायद मैं किसी और को इससे बचा सकूं।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [warm] Your daughter's energy is very strong in this room right now, I can feel her presence hovering just behind your left shoulder. [quietly] She wants you to know that she's not suffering anymore, that the pain from the accident is completely gone.

Character 2: [shaky voice] How did you know it was an accident? [pause] I never mentioned that when I booked the appointment, just said I lost someone.

Character 1: [confidently] The spirits reveal everything to those who know how to listen, and she's showing me water, lots of water. [hesitantly] Was it perhaps something involving a pool or maybe the ocean?

Character 2: [bitter] It was a car crash. [sighs]

Character 1: [quickly] Yes, rain.

Character 2: [frustrated] There wasn't any rain that day, it was the middle of July during a drought, and the roads were bone dry. [very quietly] I remember because I kept thinking how blue the sky was while we waited for the ambulance.

Character 1: [empathetically] Sometimes the details get mixed in the spiritual realm, but what matters is the message of love she's sending. [clearing throat] She's telling me about a special toy, something soft that she used to carry everywhere.

Character 2: [exhausted] Every child has a stuffed animal they love, that's not exactly a revelation from beyond. [pause] Look, I came here because my sister insisted it might help with the grief, but this is starting to feel wrong.

Character 1: She's showing me the letter M, someone important whose name starts with M, maybe Mary or Michael, someone who meant a lot to both of you. [anxious] This person needs to hear from you.

Character 2: Her name was Mia, my daughter's name was Mia, and you're fishing for information like every other charlatan I've wasted money on. [angry] You don't even know her name.

Character 1: [apologetic] Of course, Mia, that's exactly what I was sensing, she's right here telling me her name. [quickly] Sometimes the connection takes time to clarify, but now I can hear her voice so clearly, and she's singing something, a lullaby perhaps.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] She was deaf from birth, she never heard music, never sang a single note. [loudly] We learned sign language together, spent years communicating through our hands, and you're telling me she's singing to you?

Character 1: [hesitantly] In the spirit world, all limitations of the physical body are released, she can hear and speak now. [trailing off] That's one of the beautiful gifts of crossing over, all the things she couldn't do here...

Character 2: [furious] Don't you dare make her deafness sound like something that needed to be fixed. [shouting] She was perfect exactly as she was, and we had our own beautiful language that you could never understand!

Character 1: I understand you're angry, grief manifests in many ways, and sometimes people aren't ready to receive messages from the other side. [sigh] Perhaps we should take a short break.

Character 2: No, we're done here completely, and I want my three hundred dollars back immediately. [bitter] You prey on people at their absolute worst moments, when they'd give anything for just one more minute with someone they love.

Character 1: [formal] The session fee is non-refundable as stated in the agreement you signed, but I genuinely believe if you'd open your heart, you'd feel Mia's presence here. [quietly] She doesn't want you to leave like this.

Character 2: [withering] You know what the cruelest part is? [pause] For just a second when you first started talking, I let myself hope that maybe somehow you were real, that maybe I could tell her I'm sorry for looking at my phone when the truck ran the light.

Character 1: She forgives you.

Character 2: [very quietly] She's not here to forgive me, she's just gone, and you're just another liar making money from that truth. [long pause] I'm calling my credit card company to dispute the charge, and I'm posting reviews on every site I can find. [exhausted] Maybe I can save someone else from this.
