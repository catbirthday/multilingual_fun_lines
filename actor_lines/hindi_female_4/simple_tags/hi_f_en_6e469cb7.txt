Scenario: An electronic monitoring officer arrives at the home of the convicted criminal he helped put away years ago—his childhood best friend who betrayed him—to attach an ankle monitor as part of early release conditions.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [formally] So here we are again, Marcus. [clears throat] I, uh, need you to sit down and extend your right leg so I can attach this monitor. The court's orders were pretty specific about placement and, um, calibration settings.

Character 2 [en]: You volunteered for this assignment, didn't you, Danny? [bitter laugh] Out of all the officers in the department, somehow you're the one standing in my living room right now.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I didn't volunteer for anything, okay? [sighs] They assigned me because I know your patterns, your, uh, tendencies. Apparently that makes me the ideal candidate to monitor whether you're actually staying clean this time.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] You mean because you're the one who figured out I was using our old meetup spots for the deals. [pause] Twenty years of friendship and you memorized every place I might go.

Character 1 [en]: Don't do that. Don't make this about friendship when you're the one who decided dealing drugs was more important than, I mean, literally everything we built together growing up.

Character 2 [en]: [angrily] Built together? We were kids from nothing, Danny! You got lucky with that scholarship, but what was I supposed to do? Watch my mom die because we couldn't afford her treatments?

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] You could have asked for help! [louder] I would have done anything, taken out loans, worked three jobs, but instead you just, you went behind my back and used my patrol routes to avoid getting caught!

Character 2 [en]: And you think turning me in made you some kind of hero? [laughs bitterly] My mother died anyway, alone, while I was in lockup for the first six months.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I know she did. I, um, I went to the funeral. Sat in the back row and left before anyone could see me.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] You were there? [voice breaking] Why would you—after everything, after testifying against me, why would you even show up?

Character 1 [en]: Because she was like a second mother to me too, Marcus. Because before everything went to hell, your house was where I went when my dad was drinking and I needed somewhere safe.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] She asked about you, near the end. Kept wondering why you stopped coming by for Sunday dinners. I couldn't tell her that her honorary son was the reason her actual son was behind bars.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You're the reason you were behind bars. [sighs] But yeah, I think about those dinners sometimes. How she'd always make extra portions because she knew I'd pretend not to be hungry at first.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Remember when she caught us sneaking her pie before dinner that one Thanksgiving? [chuckles] She chased us around the kitchen with that wooden spoon, yelling in Spanish about how we'd ruin our appetites.

Character 1 [en]: [reluctantly smiling] Yeah, I remember.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, Danny, I know I can't undo what happened. The betrayal, using your information, all of it. But we were brothers once, weren't we? Before the badges and the bad choices?

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Don't do this to me, man. [exhales] I'm here to do a job, to make sure you comply with your release conditions, not to take some trip down memory lane about how things used to be.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] But that's exactly why this hurts so much! Every week you'll come here, checking this ankle monitor, and we'll both pretend we're strangers when we know each other's deepest secrets. How is that not killing you too?

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] The monitor's active now. You have a fifty-foot radius from your front door, and any violation will alert both me and the department immediately. [pause] I'll be back next Thursday at two PM for the first check-in.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Thursday at two. [sighs] Just like old times, except now you're making sure I can't leave instead of making sure I get home safe. [bitter] Funny how things change, isn't it, Danny?
