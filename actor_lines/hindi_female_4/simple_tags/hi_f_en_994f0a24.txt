=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Wait, is that—Maya? From the film program at CalArts? [pause] I haven't seen you since, what, junior year when you just disappeared from all our classes without saying goodbye?

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Oh god, Jason, yeah it's me. [quietly] I didn't expect to run into anyone from school here, especially not while I'm wearing this ridiculous vest helping people scan their groceries.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Hey, there's nothing wrong with honest work. [sighs] But I have to admit, I always wondered what happened to you—you were the best cinematographer in our year, everyone said so.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Life happened, Jason.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Your mom, right? [quietly] Someone mentioned she got sick, but nobody really knew the details, and then you were just gone, deleted all your social media, changed your number.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Stage four pancreatic cancer.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Jesus, Maya, I'm so sorry. [pause] We all tried to reach out, but it was like you vanished completely from the film world.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I couldn't face any of you, watching everyone else graduate and move on to their dream jobs while I was sleeping in hospital chairs and learning about insurance appeals. [exhales] How could I explain that?

Character 1 [en]: You didn't have to explain anything—we were your friends, we would have understood, we could have helped somehow.

Character 2 [en]: Help with what exactly? [frustrated] Pay the forty thousand in medical bills that insurance wouldn't cover? Take my shifts at three different jobs so I could afford her experimental treatments?

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] You're right, that was naive of me to say. [slowly] I guess I just wish you hadn't had to go through all that alone, you know?

Character 2 [en]: I wasn't alone.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] So what happened after—I mean, is your mom okay now? [hesitantly] And why are you still here instead of back in film?

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] She passed two years ago, right before Christmas. [pause] By then I'd been out of the industry so long, my reel was outdated, my connections were gone. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [earnestly] Listen, I'm focus pulling on a Netflix series that starts shooting next month, and we're actually looking for a second camera operator. [quickly] The DP would hire you in a heartbeat if he saw your old work.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Jason, don't do this—don't dangle something in front of me out of pity because you feel bad about running into the film school dropout at the grocery store.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] It's not pity, it's recognizing talent that shouldn't be wasted scanning bananas and helping confused customers reset their payment screens. [passionately] You had the best eye for composition I've ever seen.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] You don't understand, I haven't touched a professional camera in four years. [gasps] My hands shake now from anxiety, I can't even watch films anymore without thinking about everything I lost.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] The hands can be retrained, and the anxiety can be managed. [gently] What can't be replaced is natural talent and the way you see light—that's still in there somewhere, Maya.

Character 2 [en]: [very softly] I have to clock out in twenty minutes for my break. [long pause] Maybe we could grab coffee and you could tell me more about this position, just to hear about it, nothing more.
