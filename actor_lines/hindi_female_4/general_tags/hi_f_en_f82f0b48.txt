Scenario: A fish processor and an ironworker meet at the docks after the ironworker's crew accidentally damaged the freezer infrastructure at the processing plant, threatening the week's entire catch.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Look, I know you're just trying to do your job, but we've got forty thousand pounds of halibut sitting in what used to be, um, a functioning freezer system, and your welding crew just torched through the main coolant line. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] We were following the specs your maintenance team gave us, okay? Nobody said anything about active coolant lines running through that section of the dock structure—I mean, who puts refrigeration pipes inside load-bearing beams anyway?

Character 1 [en]: [increasingly urgent] It's a retrofit from the eighties when they expanded the plant, and yeah, it's not ideal, but that's, uh, that's beside the point because right now the temperature is climbing and we're about to lose the entire week's catch.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Alright, alright, let me think here—my crew's got portable welding rigs and we could probably patch that line in, what, maybe two hours if we really push it? But you'd need to, um, drain the system first.

Character 1 [en]: Two hours? Jesus, the fish'll be at room temperature by then, and once the cold chain breaks, that's it, we can't sell to any of our distributors. [pause] This is gonna bankrupt us.

Character 2 [en]: [quieter] Wait, hang on, what if we—okay this is crazy but hear me out—what if we bypass the damaged section entirely and run a temporary line over the dock?

Character 1 [en]: A temporary line? With what exactly, because last I checked, industrial coolant pipes aren't something you just, [sighs], grab from Home Depot on a Saturday afternoon.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Actually, yeah, we can.

Character 1 [en]: [incredulous] Look, I've been processing fish for fifteen years and I've never seen anyone successfully jerry-rig a cooling system with hardware store supplies—it's not just about the pipes, it's the pressure ratings, the insulation, the whole thing.

Character 2 [en]: [growing confident] No, listen, I did emergency repairs on refrigerated shipping containers in the Navy for six years before this—we can use flexible metal gas lines with the right adapters, pack them in foam insulation, and it'll hold for at least, uh, seventy-two hours. [exhales] Long enough to save your catch.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful but cautious] You're serious about this? Because if it fails, we're not just losing the fish, we're violating about twelve different health codes and probably getting the whole plant shut down.

Character 2 [en]: [steadily] I'm dead serious, and honestly, I feel responsible for this mess even though it wasn't really our fault—those blueprints were wrong. But hey, my crew's here, we've got the tools, and I know exactly what we need.

Character 1 [en]: [breathing heavily] Okay, okay, let's do it then, but I'm coming with you to get the supplies because I need to know exactly what we're working with here. [determined] My father built this business from nothing.

Character 2 [en]: [reassuring] Your dad sounds like he was a smart guy, building all this, and we're gonna make sure his legacy doesn't melt away today, alright? Let me just grab my truck keys and call my best welder back from lunch.

Character 1 [en]: Uh, thank you. Really.

Character 2 [en]: Don't thank me yet—we've still got to make this work, and I'm gonna need every person you've got who knows anything about refrigeration systems to help us map out where these bypass lines should run.

Character 1 [en]: [energized] I can get you three guys who've been maintaining these systems since before I started, and they know every pipe, every valve, every quirk of this whole setup like it's their own home.

Character 2 [en]: [chuckling] Perfect, because we're about to perform emergency surgery on this place, and I'd rather not accidentally cut into something else important while we're at it, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [lighter] Yeah, one disaster per day is definitely our limit—although honestly, after we fix this, I'm buying your whole crew dinner, and not just fish and chips either. [small laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Hey, I'll take you up on that, but first let's save forty thousand pounds of halibut from becoming very expensive cat food, yeah? Time's ticking and that temperature gauge isn't getting any friendlier.
