Scenario: An injured factory worker meets with a workers comp investigator who suspects his back injury claim may be exaggerated after surveillance footage shows him moving furniture at home.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, I don't know what you think you saw on that video, but lifting a single chair to move it out of the way isn't the same as, um, eight hours of heavy machinery work.

Character 2 [en]: [skeptically] Mr. Peterson, the surveillance shows you carrying a couch down your front steps, then loading it into a pickup truck without any apparent difficulty or, uh, signs of the debilitating pain you described in your claim.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] That was my neighbor's couch, okay? And I was helping for maybe, what, five minutes total? [sighs] My back was screaming the entire time but I couldn't just leave them stranded.

Character 2 [en]: Mm-hmm. And the footage from three days later showing you, err, playing basketball at the park? Was your back screaming then too, or was that a different neighbor needing help?

Character 1 [en]: [incredulous] Basketball? I was shooting free throws with my kid for ten minutes, not running full court! Jesus, do you people just follow me around all day waiting for me to, I dunno, bend wrong or something?

Character 2 [en]: We conduct routine investigations on claims exceeding fifty thousand dollars, Mr. Peterson, and frankly, your activities don't align with someone who claims they can't sit, stand, or walk for more than, umm, fifteen minutes at a time.

Character 1 [en]: You don't understand—

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] I understand perfectly well that you filed for permanent disability while maintaining a remarkably active lifestyle, and that's, honestly, that's a serious problem we need to address.

Character 1 [en]: Active lifestyle? Are you kidding me? I take enough painkillers to knock out a horse just to get through breakfast! [voice cracking] Some days I can move around okay, others I'm flat on my back crying.

Character 2 [en]: [unmoved] Yet you never mentioned these 'good days' in any of your medical evaluations or depositions, did you? Every single report describes constant, unrelenting pain that prevents any physical activity whatsoever.

Character 1 [en]: Because that's what the doctors told me to focus on—the worst of it! They said if I mentioned the occasional decent day, you people would use it against me, and look, [bitter laugh], here we are.

Character 2 [en]: [coolly] So you're admitting to deliberately misrepresenting your condition? Because that's, uh, that's actually insurance fraud, Mr. Peterson, which carries criminal penalties including potential jail time.

Character 1 [en]: Misrepresenting? No, I—look, I got hurt at work, really hurt, and some days are better than others but I still can't do my job anymore, alright? Isn't that what matters here?

Character 2 [en]: What matters is the truth, and right now I'm seeing significant discrepancies between your statements and your actions that, frankly, could result in immediate termination of benefits and, umm, possible prosecution.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] Please, I've got three kids and a mortgage, okay? I'm not faking anything—my back is destroyed, I just, sometimes I push through the pain when I have to because life doesn't stop, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [slightly softer] Mr. Peterson, I'm going to recommend a full medical reevaluation with an independent physician, and I strongly suggest you be, err, completely honest about your condition this time, including these variable pain levels you're describing.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Fine, whatever you need. But when your doctor confirms what I've been saying all along—that I'm permanently damaged goods—I want an apology for this, this witch hunt you're putting me through.

Character 2 [en]: [returning to professional tone] We'll see what the evaluation reveals, won't we? In the meantime, your benefits are suspended pending review. [pause] You'll receive official notification within seventy-two hours.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly furious] Suspended? My kids need to eat while you play detective! This is exactly why people hate insurance companies—you collect premiums for years then look for any excuse not to pay when we actually need help.

Character 2 [en]: [standing to leave] The review process typically takes four to six weeks, Mr. Peterson, and I'd advise you to consult with an attorney if you haven't already. [flatly] Have a good day.
