Scenario: A royal consort secretly visits the palace's underground submarine dock where a technician is preparing the escape vessel she ordered months ago without the king's knowledge.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [hushed] The submersible you've been preparing for the past three months, क्या वो कल रात coronation banquet के दौरान ready होगी, जैसे हमने discuss किया था?

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly nervous] Your Majesty, the vessel is operational, छह हफ्ते के लिए सारा सामान भी रखा है, लेकिन मुझे जानना है कि आप सच में ये करना चाहती हैं।

Character 1 [mix]: [sharp whisper] Don't question me now. अभी नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [measured] Forgive me, लेकिन जब राजा को पता चलेगा कि आप छोटे राजकुमार के साथ गायब हो गई हैं, तो वो हर उस आदमी से पूछताछ करेंगे जिसकी इन tunnels तक पहुंच थी, खासकर मेरे जैसे maintenance staff से।

Character 1 [mix]: You'll be at the banquet serving as emergency technical support, fountain display के लिए, तुम्हारा alibi पक्का है, और सुबह तक तुम्हें वो सोना मिल जाएगा जो मैंने वादा किया था। [exhales]

Character 2 [mix]: [carefully] The navigation system is programmed for neutral waters, Azores के पास, लेकिन जब आप surface करेंगी, तो बारह घंटे के अंदर extraction team से contact करना होगा, वरना GPS beacon expire हो जाएगा।

Character 1 [mix]: I memorized the protocols. सब याद कर लिया है।

Character 2 [mix]: [reluctantly] There's something else—कल palace guard captain यहाँ नीचे आया था, unusual maintenance schedules के बारे में पूछ रहा था, और मुझे लगता है उसे शक है कि इन निचले levels में कुछ हो रहा है।

Character 1 [mix]: [breath catching] Captain Marquez was here? उसे submersible bay और हमारे arrangement के बारे में तुमने क्या बताया exactly?

Character 2 [mix]: Nothing directly, मैंने उसे routine inspection logs दिखाए और budget cuts की शिकायत की, कि equipment upgrades में कैसे दिक्कत आ रही है, बस boring technical details जिससे उसकी आंखें झपकने लगीं। [nervous laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: He's been watching me more closely, पिछले महीने ambassador की visit के बाद से, palace में मेरी हर movement follow कर रहा है, मेरी ladies-in-waiting से मेरे सोने के pattern के बारे में पूछ रहा है।

Character 2 [mix]: [grimly] Your Majesty, अगर उसे submarine dock के बारे में पता है, तो ये escape route compromise हो गया है और हमें पूरा plan तुरंत cancel कर देना चाहिए।

Character 1 [mix]: [fiercely quiet] Abort? छोड़ दूं? मेरा बेटा next week पांच साल का हो जाएगा, इतना बड़ा कि उसके पिता वही military indoctrination शुरू कर सकें जिसने उसके बड़े भाई को... तबाह कर दिया।

Character 2 [mix]: [pause] Prince Eduard's death was ruled a training accident, लेकिन submarine corps में सब जानते हैं कि वो पानी cadet exercise के लिए बहुत rough था।

Character 1 [mix]: [voice breaking slightly] The king called it character building, कहता था Eduard को prove करना होगा कि वो throne के लायक है, और अब वो मेरे छोटे बेटे को उसी नज़र से देख रहा है।

Character 2 [mix]: [softly] My own daughter is the prince's age, और अगर कोई उसे ऐसे threaten करे, तो शायद मैं भी submarine चुरा लेती।

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter whisper] Steal? चुराना? मैं तो अपना ही ले रही हूं।

Character 2 [mix]: The submersible's external cameras are disabled, dock logs में दिखता है कि इसे scrap के लिए decommission कर दिया गया है, तो technically किसी official inventory में ये exist ही नहीं करता अब।

Character 1 [mix]: [steadying herself] Tomorrow night at eleven-thirty, मैं service tunnel से अपने बेटे के साथ अंदर आऊंगी, और तुम ensure करोगी कि automated launch sequence बिना कोई alarm trigger किए शुरू हो जाए।

Character 2 [mix]: [resigned] I'll be here, Your Majesty, हमेशा की तरह छायाओं में इंतज़ार करती रहूंगी, दुआ करती हूं कि इसके बाद जो होगा, हम दोनों उससे बच जाएं। [exhales slowly]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [hushed] The submersible you've been preparing for the past three months, it's ready for deployment tomorrow night during the coronation banquet, exactly as we discussed?

Character 2: [quietly nervous] Your Majesty, the vessel is operational and fully stocked with provisions for six weeks at sea, but I need to know if you're certain about this.

Character 1: [sharp whisper] Don't question me now.

Character 2: [measured] Forgive me, but when the king discovers you've vanished with the young prince, they'll interrogate everyone who had access to these tunnels, starting with maintenance staff like me.

Character 1: You'll be at the banquet serving as emergency technical support for the fountain display, your alibi is airtight, and by dawn you'll have the gold I promised. [exhales]

Character 2: [carefully] The navigation system is programmed for neutral waters near the Azores, but once you surface, you'll need to contact the extraction team within twelve hours or the GPS beacon expires.

Character 1: I memorized the protocols.

Character 2: [reluctantly] There's something else—the palace guard captain came down here yesterday asking about unusual maintenance schedules, and I think he suspects something's happening in these lower levels.

Character 1: [breath catching] Captain Marquez was here? What exactly did you tell him about the submersible bay and our arrangement?

Character 2: Nothing directly, I showed him routine inspection logs and complained about budget cuts affecting our equipment upgrades, just boring technical details that made his eyes glaze over. [nervous laugh]

Character 1: He's been watching me more closely since the ambassador's visit last month, following my movements through the palace, questioning my ladies-in-waiting about my sleeping patterns.

Character 2: [grimly] Your Majesty, if he knows about the submarine dock, this escape route is compromised and we should abort the entire plan immediately.

Character 1: [fiercely quiet] Abort? My son turns five next week, old enough for his father to begin the same military indoctrination that destroyed his older brother.

Character 2: Prince Eduard's death was ruled a training accident, but everyone in the submarine corps knows those waters were too rough for a cadet exercise. [pause]

Character 1: [voice breaking slightly] The king called it character building, said Eduard needed to prove himself worthy of the throne, and now he's eyeing my youngest with the same expectations.

Character 2: [softly] My own daughter is the prince's age, and if someone threatened her like that, I'd probably steal a submarine too.

Character 1: [bitter whisper] Steal? I'm taking what's mine.

Character 2: The submersible's external cameras are disabled and the dock logs show it's been decommissioned for scrap, so technically it doesn't exist anymore on any official inventory.

Character 1: [steadying herself] Tomorrow night at eleven-thirty, I'll enter through the service tunnel with my son, and you'll ensure the automated launch sequence initiates without triggering any alarms.

Character 2: [resigned] I'll be here, Your Majesty, waiting in the shadows like always, praying we both survive what comes after. [exhales slowly]
