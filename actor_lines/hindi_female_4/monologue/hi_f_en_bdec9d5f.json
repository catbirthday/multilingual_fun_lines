Out of, what, three hundred applicants? [laugh] I keep refreshing the email because I'm convinced it's gonna disappear or say \"just kidding\" or something. [anxious] But it's real, it's... it's actually real. [sniffle] God, I'm gonna cry. [crying while speaking] All those nights I stayed up rewriting that personal statement, wondering if I was being too, um... too honest about everything. [relieved] About growing up where I did, about being the only one who looked like me in my undergrad program. [passionately] And they didn't just tolerate my story—they wanted it! [cheerful] They specifically said my perspective would be, uh, \"invaluable to the research community.\" [very quietly] Mom's gonna lose her mind when I tell her. [smiling speaking] She always said I'd make it somewhere big, but I think even she didn't... I mean, Stanford? [excited] The same lab that published that groundbreaking study I've been obsessing over for two years? [confidently] I'm gonna be working there. Me. The kid who almost dropped out sophomore year because I didn't think I belonged. [warm] Turns out maybe I belonged all along."
