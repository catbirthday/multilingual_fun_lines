Speaker [en]: [gasp softly] Two hundred? Wait, that can't be right. [confused] Let me refresh this... no, it's still saying two hundred new subjects added. [frustrated] Are you kidding me right now? I just—I literally just finished organizing the last batch yesterday. [pause] Took me what, three weeks? [exhausted] And now there's... ugh, two hundred more. [bitter] Of course there are. Because why would anything be easy, right? [sarcastic] Oh sure, just dump them all in at once, that's totally manageable. [anxious] I mean, how am I even supposed to... hmm, maybe if I sort them by category first? [mumbling] But then I'd have to cross-reference with the existing ones, and that's gonna take... [trailing off] [deep pitch] Okay. Breathe. [slowly] It's fine, it's totally fine. [nervous] I just need to, uh... I need to prioritize. [speaking fast] Start with the urgent ones, leave the rest for later, maybe delegate some to Sarah? [hopeful] Actually, wait—Sarah owes me from last month. [excited] Oh my god, yes! [relieved] She can take at least fifty of these. [cheerful] And if I work through maybe twenty a day, that's... um, that's actually doable. [confidently] You know what? I got this.
