Speaker [en]: [gasp] Wait, what? She got in? To MIT? With a full— [pause] oh my god, she actually did it. [extremely happy] That kid who could barely make eye contact when we first met, who used to stutter through every presentation, she just— [laugh] I can't believe this is real! Remember when she thought she wasn't smart enough? When she wanted to quit the robotics team because, um, because she said everyone else was better? [warm] And I told her to just stick it out one more week. One more week turned into two years of her basically living in that lab. [sniffle] God, I'm actually getting emotional about this.

[crying while speaking] That's all she wrote after telling me the news. Like I did something special when really I just... I just saw what was already there, you know? [laugh loudly] MIT better be ready for her. They have no idea what kind of brilliant weirdo they're getting. [very sincerely] I'm so proud of that kid.
