[sigh] I keep telling myself it'll pick up, but who am I kidding? Twenty-seven years I've been fixing horns in this shop. Twenty-seven years of, um, of learning every quirk of every vintage trumpet that comes through that door. [bitter] But sure, take your Stradivarius Bach to the nineteen-year-old at MusicMax who learned brass repair from a two-week corporate training video. I'm sure they'll treat it real nice. [frustrated] You know what kills me? These people come in here asking for advice, picking my brain about their instrument problems, and then—then they walk out and order the parts online or drive to the chain store because it's five dollars cheaper. Five dollars! [sad] My grandfather started this shop in 1958. He fixed Miles Davis's trumpet once, did I ever tell you that? [pause] The lease is up in two months and the landlord wants to triple the rent. Triple it. Because apparently this neighborhood is, uh, \"up and coming\" now. [very quietly] I don't know how to do anything else. This is all I know. [resigned] Maybe I should just... apply at MusicMax. They're hiring."
