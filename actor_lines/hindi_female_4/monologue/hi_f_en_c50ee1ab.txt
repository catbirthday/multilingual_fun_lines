Subject: The funeral director training program you've worked toward for two years just got cancelled due to budget cuts

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Two years. Two fucking years I've been working toward this and they just... they just sent an email? [bitter] "Due to unforeseen budget constraints" — are you kidding me? [angry] How is this unforeseen when I've been paying tuition for, what, four semesters already? 

[long pause]

I literally rearranged my entire life for this. [upset] Took out loans, quit my job at the clinic because the hours wouldn't work with practicum. My mom thought I was crazy anyway, wanting to work with dead people, but I was so sure, you know? Like this was... this was actually something I was good at. [very quietly] The families I worked with during observation, they said I had a gift for it.

[frustrated] And now what? I'm supposed to just, um... find something else? Start over? [sarcastic] Oh great, maybe I'll become an accountant. Super fulfilling. 

[sigh]

The worst part is I actually loved it. [sad] The restoration techniques, the grief counseling courses, even the—God, even the embalming chemistry. Who else gets excited about arterial fluid ratios? 

[pause]

I guess I could... I don't know, maybe apply to the program upstate? But that's another year of waiting, if they even accept my credits. 

[very melancholic] All those people I was going to help through their worst days... 

[whispering] What the hell do I do now?
