Subject: Finding out the consular officer position you've wanted for years went to someone with half your experience

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] They gave it to Marcus. [pause] Marcus, who's been here what—two years? Maybe three? [angry] I've been working toward this position for eight fucking years. [sigh] Eight years of, um... of proving myself, taking on every impossible case, learning Mandarin on my own time because I thought it would help. [frustrated] And they give it to someone who still needs help filling out basic visa forms? [laughs] That's... wow. [sad] I mean, I knew when they kept postponing my interview that something was off, but I thought maybe they were just, you know, busy or whatever. [pause] Not that they were already grooming someone else. [very slowly] Someone who golfs with the Deputy Chief every weekend, apparently. [sarcastic] Because that's what really matters for consular work, right? Your handicap? [upset] God, I'm such an idiot. [pause] All those nights I stayed late, thinking it would... hmm, thinking it would actually mean something. [quietly] My kids barely saw me last year. [bitter] And for what? So Marcus could waltz in with his, uh... his connections and his daddy's recommendation letter? [exhausted] I don't even know why I'm surprised anymore. [trailing off] This is just how it works, isn't it...
