[pause] Three generations on that land, and I— I flooded it all away because I pulled the wrong gate. [very sad] One lever. That's all it took. Twenty seconds of not paying attention and their entire wheat crop is gone. Their house, the foundation's cracked. The animals they couldn't get out in time... [sigh] I can't stop thinking about the sound the water made when it hit. Like this, um, like this roar that shouldn't have been there. [angry] God, I'm such an idiot! How do you mess up something you've done a thousand times? [shaky voice] They were so quiet when I tried to apologize. The old man just looked at me and said \"mistakes happen\" but his eyes were just... empty. [anxious] The company's insurance will cover the damages, they keep telling me that, but that's not— that's not the point. [crying while speaking] You can't just replace forty years of soil cultivation. You can't insurance-claim your way back to, uh, to having a home that doesn't smell like flood water. [apologetic] I offered to help them rebuild, to work for free, to do anything, but what good am I? I'm the one who destroyed everything."
