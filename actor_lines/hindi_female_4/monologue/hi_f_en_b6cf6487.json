[very quickly] And it's touching the metal siding, that's— that's really bad. [pause] [shaky voice] Someone could die. A kid could touch this. [frustrated] How long has this been like this? [anxious] I need to call this in right now. [quickly] Where's my— where's my phone? [mumbling] Come on, come on. [clearing throat] Hi, yeah, this is route seventeen, I've got a Code Red electrical hazard at 4782 Maple. [stern] No, I'm serious, completely exposed high voltage line. [passionately] You need to get someone here NOW. The whole side of the building is probably energized. [relieved] Yes, I'll stay here and keep people away until— [gasp softly] wait, there's a woman walking her dog right toward it. [shouting] Ma'am! MA'AM! Stay back from the building!
