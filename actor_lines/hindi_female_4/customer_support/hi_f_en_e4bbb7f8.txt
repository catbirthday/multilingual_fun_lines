Customer [en]: Wait. I just saw. Forty-nine ninety-nine? Monthly? Since when—no wait, let me check—

Customer Support [en]: *exhales* Okay, I can definitely help you with that cancellation. Let me just pull up your account... hmm, I'm seeing subscription ID SUB-47291-MB here. Started back in March. For the premium streaming package?

Customer [en]: March? That's—geez. Eight months. Of nothing. I don't even—

Customer Support [en]: *sharp inhale* Yeah, I... I get it. Happens more than you'd think actually. So the system shows, uh, zero usage since May. Which is. Not great. Let me see what options I have for you here.

Customer [en]: Zero usage. Course. So can you just. Kill it? Now?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, yes, canceling that right now... *exhales* Done. Effective immediately. Reference number is CAN-8827-XK. The thing is though. Our refund policy only covers thirty days. I wish I had better news on that front.

Customer [en]: Thirty days. Out of eight months. That's. Hmm. Okay so what if—

Customer Support [en]: *soft exhale* Look, I'm... between you and me? I hate this policy. Account's showing $399.92 in charges total. Best I can officially do is that last month. But let me. Actually. Hold on.

Customer [en]: Four hundred—okay wait. You're checking something? Or...

Customer Support [en]: So there's this. Uh. Retention credit code, RET-LOYAL-50. Technically for keeping customers but. Since you had zero usage. I could maybe argue this counts as, er, service recovery? Gets you another fifty back.

Customer [en]: Service recovery. Ha. Sure. I mean. Better than nothing right?

Customer Support [en]: *exhales* Right, exactly. So with both credits you'd get $99.98 back. Processing in three to five business days to your card ending in 4429. Not the full amount but. It's something at least.

Customer [en]: Ninety-nine ninety-eight. Out of four hundred. Well. Next time I'll. Actually check my statements.

Customer Support [en]: Honestly? Set yourself a reminder. I, um. I learned that the hard way myself actually. Had a gym membership for. *nervous exhale* Fourteen months. Never went once.

Customer [en]: Fourteen months! Okay that's. That makes me feel. Slightly less stupid actually.

Customer Support [en]: *soft laugh* Right? The worst part was driving past it every day. Anyway your confirmation email's going to CU47291@gmail. And genuinely, if there's any issue with that refund. Call back, reference CAN-8827-XK.

Customer [en]: Every day. Ouch. Yeah no that's. Thanks though. For the extra fifty.

Customer Support [en]: Of course, I just. Wish it could be more, you know? System's already processed the cancellation so. You're all set there. No more charges going forward.

Customer [en]: Good. Done. One less thing to. Hmm. Actually quick question—

Customer Support [en]: *inhale* Yeah, shoot. Still got your account up here. What's, uh. What's on your mind?
