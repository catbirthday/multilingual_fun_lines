Character 1: What are those numbers you're reciting?

Character 2: These are part of the dhikr, the remembrance of Allah through counting. We recite "Subhan Allah" thirty-three times, "Alhamdulillah" thirty-three times, and "Allahu Akbar" thirty-four times after each prayer.

Character 1: [gasp softly] That's a hundred total.

Character 2: Exactly one hundred. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, recommended this specific counting sequence. It helps maintain focus and creates a meditative rhythm that calms the mind.

Character 1: [apologetic] Sorry if I'm interrupting your prayer.

Character 2: [bitter] No no, I finished the obligatory part already. People often think we can't speak during any religious practice, but the dhikr afterwards is more flexible. You're genuinely curious, and that's always welcome.

Character 1: So you count on your fingers?

Character 2: Some use prayer beads called misbaha, but I prefer my fingers—there's a hadith that says the fingers will testify for you on judgment day. Each segment of your fingers helps you keep track: thirty-three, thirty-three, thirty-four.

Character 1: What do those phrases mean exactly?

Character 2: "Subhan Allah" means glory be to God, expressing His perfection. "Alhamdulillah" means all praise belongs to God. "Allahu Akbar" means God is greater than anything we can imagine.

Character 1: And you do this five times daily?

Character 2: [friendly] Five times after each obligatory prayer, yes! That's five hundred remembrances throughout the day. The numbers create a beautiful mathematical pattern—it's actually quite fascinating from a neurological perspective too.

Character 1: How so?

Character 2: [chuckle] Well, repetitive counting activates the prefrontal cortex while the spiritual focus engages the limbic system. It's like meditation meets mathematics—your brain gets both analytical exercise and emotional regulation simultaneously.

Character 1: You sound like a scientist.

Character 2: [bored] I have a PhD in neuroscience actually. Studied at MIT before returning to my faith more deeply. Science and spirituality aren't opposites—they're different languages describing the same magnificent reality.

Character 1: That's an interesting perspective.

Character 2: [pause] The Quran mentions numbers frequently—seven heavens, six days of creation, the ninety-nine names of Allah. Mathematical precision appears throughout divine revelation, which makes sense since mathematics is the language of the universe itself.

Character 1: Ninety-nine names?

Character 2: Each one describes a different attribute of the Divine—The Merciful, The Wise, The Creator. Some scholars spend their entire lives contemplating just one name, finding infinite depth in its meaning and application to existence.
