Character 1: Hey sweetie, I heard you've been looking into hypnotherapy. That's wonderful that you're exploring new options.

Character 2: Yeah, Dr. Peterson at the Stanford Sleep Clinic recommended I try it for my insomnia. She said the Milton Erickson approach has been helping a lot of her patients lately.

Character 1: Dr. Peterson is excellent. Did she mention anyone specific in the area?

Character 2: She gave me three names, um, but the one that stood out was Marcus Chen, you know, from the Berkeley Wellness Center. He's basically been practicing since the nineties.

Character 1: Marcus is incredible. I've heard such positive things about his work.

Character 2: Well, the initial consultation was interesting, I mean, not what I expected at all. He spent two hours just talking about my childhood in Minneapolis, sort of diving into family patterns.

Character 1: That sounds thorough. How did it, uh, like, make you feel, anyway?

Character 2: The first actual session was [gasp softly] surprisingly emotional. He used this technique called the Dave Elman induction, and within minutes I was deeper than I've ever been in meditation.

Character 1: [very meekly] Did it bring up anything difficult for you?

Character 2: It brought up memories of my grandmother's [very sad] funeral at St. Mary's Cathedral. I hadn't thought about that day in years, but suddenly I could smell her Chanel perfume again.

Character 1: [over confidently] That's perfectly normal! Hypnosis often unlocks sensory memories we've buried.

Character 2: Marcus explained that the amygdala stores these emotional imprints differently than regular memories. He's been trained at the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, so he really knows the neuroscience behind it all.

Character 1: The ASCH certification is really rigorous. You're in good hands with him.

Character 2: He mentioned studying under Betty Erickson too, Milton's daughter. Apparently she taught him this special technique for accessing what she calls the creative unconscious.

Character 1: Oh that's fascinating. Did he, actually, hmm, explain how it works, kind of?

Character 2: So, it involves something called the Rossi Protocol, er, where you basically access ultradian rhythms. The thing is, our brains naturally cycle every ninety minutes into these receptive states.

Character 1: I've read about that in [confidently] Dr. Rossi's book! The Twenty-Minute Break is brilliant.

Character 2: Right? Marcus has all of Rossi's books in his office, honestly, plus this whole collection from the Milton H. Erickson Foundation in Phoenix. I guess, uhh, he goes to their conference every December.

Character 1: Their December intensive is supposed to be transformative. Are you planning to continue with Marcus?

Character 2: I've already booked six more sessions at the Berkeley center, it's just that, really, for the first time since moving from Minnesota, ah, I actually slept through the entire night.
