=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I just got promoted to team lead and I'm [gasp loudly] completely overwhelmed. Help?

Character 2: Oh sweetie, of course you're overwhelmed. Being thrown into leadership without proper training is basically setting you up to fail, but I suppose they had their reasons for choosing you.

Character 1: Well, I mean, I thought I was ready for it, you know, but um, now I'm not so sure.

Character 2: Listen, the fact that you're already doubting yourself tells me everything I need to know. Most people in your position would at least pretend to have confidence for the first week or two.

Character 1: That's a bit [curious] harsh, don't you think?

Character 2: Harsh? No no no, I'm just being, er, honest with you because clearly no one else will be. Look, basically, leadership isn't for everyone, and there's absolutely no shame in admitting you're in over your head.

Character 1: So, what am I supposed to do then? I guess, should I just, uhh, quit already?

Character 2: Quitting would certainly be the easy way out, wouldn't it? But since you asked for my help, let me break this down into tiny, manageable pieces that even you can handle.

Character 1: Okay so, what's the first thing I should, hmm, focus on? The thing is, I don't even know where to start.

Character 2: Right, well, first you need to stop panicking like a, you know, deer in headlights. Start with something simple like, I mean, learning your team members' names and what they actually do—baby steps, basically.

Character 1: I already know their names! It's just that, err, managing them is different from, actually, working alongside them.

Character 2: Oh bless your heart, of course it's [very sincerely] different! You're supposed to be, um, their leader now, not their friend, though honestly I'm not sure you're ready for that distinction yet.

Character 1: You're kind of, uhh, being really condescending right now. I thought you were, well, going to help me?

Character 2: Help? This IS me helping, sweetheart. Would you prefer I, hmm, sugarcoat everything and let you fail spectacularly? Real advice isn't always, you know, comfortable to hear.

Character 1: Fine. So like, what about dealing with people who, err, don't respect me? There's this one guy who, anyway, keeps undermining me.

Character 2: Well of course he's undermining you—you're literally, uh, broadcasting your insecurity to everyone. People can smell fear, and right now you're, I guess, absolutely reeking of it.

Character 1: That's not— I mean, how do I actually, umm, fix that then? The thing is, I can't just pretend to be confident.

Character 2: Can't you though? Fake it till you make it is, like, literally the oldest trick in the book. But I suppose if you can't even, well, pretend to be competent, maybe this really isn't for you after all.

Character 1: You know what? Actually, forget it. This was, uhh, clearly a mistake. I'll figure it out, honestly, on my own.

Character 2: Oh don't be so [very quickly] sensitive! I'm only trying to, er, prepare you for reality because clearly no one else has bothered to, you know, tell you the truth about your obvious limitations.
