Character 1: I'm working [shouting] on the Banksy restoration! The one from the Bristol underpass!

Character 2: Oh, that's the 2009 piece with, um, the modified epoxy resins. We actually analyzed the pigment degradation patterns using, you know, Raman spectroscopy at the conservation lab last month.

Character 1: What did the spectroscopy reveal about the paint composition?

Character 2: Well, he used Krylon ColorMaster aerosol with, er, a modified alkyd base. The thing is, Montana Gold caps were definitely involved for the fine detail work on the stenciling.

Character 1: Those caps give such precise control. Did you identify the stencil material?

Character 2: The stencils were [cry] acetate sheets, 0.5mm thickness. We found microscopic fragments embedded in the primer layer using our Leica DVM6 digital microscope at 2500x magnification.

Character 1: That's [anxious] incredibly, um, detailed analysis. How do you, like, preserve the original integrity while, you know, restoring it?

Character 2: We're using cyclododecane as a temporary consolidant before applying the Paraloid B-72 in xylene solution. The CDD sublimes at room temperature, leaving zero residue on the original pigments.

Character 1: Cyclododecane is brilliant for that. Uh, what about the, well, underlying concrete substrate? I mean, is it stable?

Character 2: The carbonation depth is, hmm, approximately 12mm according to our phenolphthalein tests. Actually, we're injecting ethyl silicate consolidant, you know, through microneedles to strengthen the substrate matrix.

Character 1: Ethyl silicate penetration must be carefully controlled though.

Character 2: Exactly. We monitor the [gasp loudly] penetration depth using ultrasonic pulse velocity testing. The Proceq Pundit PL-200 gives us readings every 2mm through the concrete structure.

Character 1: The Pundit's resolution is impressive. What's your timeline for completion?

Character 2: Four weeks total. We're documenting everything with RTI imaging— that's Reflectance Transformation Imaging— capturing 48 different light angles for complete surface topology mapping.

Character 1: RTI is [whispering] fantastic for surface, um, basically for texture documentation. Are you, well, using polynomial texture mapping too?

Character 2: Yes! The PTM [high-pitched] files are processed through CHI's RTIViewer software. We're generating normal maps at 300 DPI resolution for archival purposes at the Tate Modern's conservation database.

Character 1: The Tate's database has strict metadata requirements.

Character 2: Right, so [confidently] we follow CIDOC-CRM standards for, like, cultural heritage documentation. Every intervention is basically logged with XRF spectrometry data, honestly, down to individual pigment particles.

Character 1: XRF gives such precise elemental analysis. Will this be publicly accessible?

Character 2: The full technical report goes [slowly] live on ArtTechConservation.org next month. We're including hyperspectral imaging data, consolidant penetration maps, and time-lapse photogrammetry of the entire restoration process.
