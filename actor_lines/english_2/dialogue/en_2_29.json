            "content": "Oh boy, buckle up because this is [animated] where it gets really technical—AP Style is what newspapers use for brevity while Chicago Manual of Style is the heavyweight champion of academic and book publishing with its thousand-plus pages of rules."

            "content": "Oh it's huge—I mean, there was that lawsuit about, well, dairy drivers that hinged on a missing Oxford comma costing a company millions, and, you know, style guides basically determine whether you write \"website\" or \"Web site\" which actually matters for consistency."

            "content": "Most don't—they keep, um, reference guides handy and use software like PerfectIt or, you know, Grammarly's style guide settings, but, basically, consistency within your document matters more than perfect adherence."
