=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're telling me people actually dance their way through trauma?

Character 2: [angry] It's not just dancing around randomly! Dance therapy is a legitimate psychotherapeutic practice that uses movement to support emotional, cognitive, and physical integration. There's real science behind it.

Character 1: Whoa, okay, I didn't mean to offend. How does it actually work then?

Character 2: The premise is that body and mind are interconnected. When we store trauma, we hold it physically—tension patterns, restricted movement, chronic pain. Dance therapy helps release those patterns through deliberate, conscious movement.

Character 1: That makes sense. Is it like regular therapy but with dancing?

Character 2: Not exactly. A dance therapist observes your natural movement patterns first, then guides you through exercises designed to expand your movement vocabulary. Each gesture can unlock different emotional states or memories.

Character 1: [chuckle] I can barely do the electric slide. Would this work for someone like me?

Character 2: [sneeze] Excuse me. Technical dance skill is completely irrelevant here. It's about authentic movement, not performance. Even simple swaying or hand gestures can be profoundly therapeutic.

Character 1: [very quietly] My sister went through something really traumatic last year. Could this help her?

Character 2: [laugh histerically] Sorry, that's not— I'm not laughing at your sister! I just remembered my first session where I literally just stood there frozen for twenty minutes. Yes, it could absolutely help her.

Character 1: [cry] That's actually really encouraging. She's been so stuck.

Character 2: The research is compelling. Studies show significant improvements in PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety. The key is finding a certified dance/movement therapist who specializes in trauma work.

Character 1: How long does treatment usually take?

Character 2: Typically we're looking at twelve to twenty sessions for noticeable progress, though some people experience breakthroughs much sooner. Every nervous system heals at its own pace.

Character 1: Do you need a special space for it?

Character 2: [very quietly] Just enough room to move safely. Some sessions happen in regular therapy offices, others in dance studios. The space matters less than feeling secure enough to explore movement.

Character 1: What made you specialize in this particular field?

Character 2: [very excited] I was a professional dancer who developed chronic pain from an injury. Traditional therapy helped my mind but my body stayed frozen until I discovered DMT—dance/movement therapy, not the drug! It literally gave me my life back.

Character 1: That's an incredible journey. You must see amazing transformations.

Character 2: Every single day. Yesterday a veteran who couldn't make eye contact for two years did a trust fall. The body remembers how to heal when we give it permission to move.
