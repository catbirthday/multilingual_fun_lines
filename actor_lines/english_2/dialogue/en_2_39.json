            "content": "Abstract sculpture is, um, so freeing! You know, have you seen those Alberto Giacometti pieces where, basically, the figures are all stretched and elongated? They're technically figurative but they feel abstract because of how he distorts reality."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "Plaster is, uh, definitely more forgiving than marble! Actually, did you know Michelangelo believed he was just, sort of, releasing figures that already existed inside the stone? Imagine having that confidence—like the sculpture is already perfect and you're just the delivery mechanism!"
