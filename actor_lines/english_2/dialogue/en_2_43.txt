Character 1: So retirement planning... feels like something I should care about but don't.

Character 2: Yeah, I totally get that feeling. When you're young it seems impossibly far away, like worrying about what you'll eat for dinner in 2055. But the math is pretty wild if you start early.

Character 1: The math?

Character 2: Well, um, compound interest is, you know, basically magic when you give it enough time. Even small amounts, like, grow exponentially over decades.

Character 1: Twenty bucks a month [chuckle] isn't going to make me rich though.

Character 2: Actually, uh, twenty bucks monthly starting at 25, I mean, with average market returns, sort of becomes around thirty thousand by 65. Not retirement money alone but it's something.

Character 1: That can't be right.

Character 2: Honestly, I wish someone had, er, explained this to me [regretful] when I was younger, you know. Started teaching at 35 and basically lost a decade of compound growth.

Character 1: Adjunct life doesn't exactly pay retirement money anyway.

Character 2: Truth. Most universities don't even offer us retirement matching, which is criminal considering we teach half their classes. But there are workarounds like IRAs that anyone can open.

Character 1: IRAs sound, um, [whispering] complicated and, like, really boring honestly.

Character 2: They're surprisingly simple once you strip away all the jargon. You put money in, pick a target-date fund based on when you'll retire, and then basically ignore it for forty years.

Character 1: But, well, what if I, [shaky voice] you know, need that money before then?

Character 2: So, [very quietly] there's actually Roth IRAs where, hmm, you can withdraw your contributions anytime, I mean, without penalties. Just not the earnings part.

Character 1: That's slightly less terrifying.

Character 2: Right? And, uh, here's the thing, most people think you need, actually, thousands to start but Fidelity lets you open one with literally nothing.

Character 1: Nothing? That's, er, hard to believe, I guess.

Character 2: Seriously, um, zero minimum, and then you just, well, add whatever you can whenever, you know. Even five bucks here and there beats nothing.

Character 1: Maybe I should stop buying so much coffee.

Character 2: Or we could grab coffee sometime and I'll [flirtatious] show you how to set one up on your phone. Takes about ten minutes, and then you're officially a responsible adult with a retirement account.
