Character 1: So, um, how's the whole content creation thing, you know, working out? Kind of curious.

Character 2: Oh god, it's [exhausted] honestly burning me out faster than I expected. Three years in and I'm questioning everything about why I started this whole influencer journey.

Character 1: Three years? Well, that's, [chuckle], I mean, pretty impressive, uh.

Character 2: Impressive feels generous, honestly. I'm making decent money now, like, around four thousand monthly, but the pressure to constantly produce content is, er, sort of eating me alive.

Character 1: Four thousand? That's actually really good.

Character 2: Sure, but, hmm, nobody talks about [sigh] the mental toll, actually. I haven't taken a real day off in basically eighteen months because the algorithm punishes any breaks.

Character 1: So, can't you just, uhh, schedule posts ahead? I guess that's a thing?

Character 2: I do batch content, yeah. But engagement tanks when people realize you're not actually there responding in real-time, and sponsors track that stuff obsessively now.

Character 1: Sponsors sound demanding.

Character 2: The thing is, um, I signed some contracts [very meekly] that I really shouldn't have. One brand basically owns my Thursdays for another six months.

Character 1: Owns your Thursdays? That's, err, pretty weird, anyway. It's just that I've never heard of that.

Character 2: They get first approval on any Thursday content, even personal posts. I was desperate for steady income when I signed it, but now it feels like selling pieces of my life.

Character 1: Ah, that's rough. Well, you know, at least it ends eventually?

Character 2: Yeah, in February, hmmm, but I'm [sleepily] already getting pitched similar deals, kind of. I mean, the money's tempting when rent keeps climbing.

Character 1: Okay so, what would you, like, do differently if you could, uh, start over?

Character 2: I'd stay anonymous, definitely. Having my real name attached to everything means I can't even vent about bad days without losing followers or disappointing brands.

Character 1: Anonymous creators do pretty well though, right?

Character 2: Some make millions behind avatars and usernames. Meanwhile I'm over here getting recognized at grocery stores by people who think they own me because they watch my stories.

Character 1: That sounds genuinely uncomfortable.

Character 2: Last week someone filmed me crying in my car after a therapy session and posted it asking if I was okay. That level of surveillance isn't worth any amount of sponsorship money.
