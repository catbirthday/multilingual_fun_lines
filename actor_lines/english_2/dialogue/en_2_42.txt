Character 1: I don't know if my little startup really counts as disruptive innovation.

Character 2: Oh come on, don't sell yourself short! Any company that's challenging the status quo and making established players nervous is definitely disrupting something—what exactly are you working on?

Character 1: Just a small app for local farmers to share equipment.

Character 2: See, that's um, exactly what Clayton Christensen was, you know, talking about—starting with an underserved market that big companies actually ignore because the margins look too small.

Character 1: I mean, John Deere probably isn't worried about us.

Character 2: You'd be surprised though—Kodak wasn't [very melancholic] worried about digital cameras either at first, and look where that got them. These giant companies often miss the real threats because they're too focused on their existing profitable customers.

Character 1: That seems [stern] a bit dramatic for our tiny operation.

Character 2: Well, I'm just saying, uh, Netflix started by mailing DVDs and, [sleepily], Blockbuster laughed at them, sort of dismissed the whole thing as a niche market for film buffs.

Character 1: But hmm, we're just, I mean, helping neighbors share tractors, like, nothing revolutionary.

Character 2: Right right, but er, that's basically how Airbnb started too, you know—just people renting out air mattresses during a conference when hotels were booked, and now they're bigger than Marriott and Hilton combined.

Character 1: I so, never thought of it, uhh, [happy] that way before, honestly.

Character 2: The thing is, real disruption, um, almost always looks insignificant at first, I guess because it serves customers that established companies don't even want—that's why they don't see it coming until it's too late.

Character 1: Our users are kind of, well, mostly older farmers who, er, can't afford new equipment.

Character 2: Perfect! That's ah, your wedge right there—once you nail that market, really build trust, you know, you can gradually move upmarket with better features and eventually compete directly with equipment dealers.

Character 1: That feels way beyond what we're capable of.

Character 2: Listen, hmm, Amazon started selling books—just books!—and actually, everyone thought they were crazy, I mean, because Barnes & Noble had that market locked down, but look at them now, they're in everything.

Character 1: Maybe uhh, you're right, but it's sort of, scary to think about it, anyway, getting that big.

Character 2: Absolutely, and you don't have to aim for world domination right away—just focus on solving your farmers' problems really well, and the growth will follow naturally if you're truly filling a need.

Character 1: I suppose every big company started somewhere small.

Character 2: Exactly! Microsoft started in a garage, Facebook in a dorm room—the key is you're solving a real problem that nobody else is addressing, and that's where all great disruption begins.
