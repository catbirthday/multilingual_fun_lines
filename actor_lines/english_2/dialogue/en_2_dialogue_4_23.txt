=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [curious] Hi there! I don't think we've met before—are you new to the building?

Character 2: Oh! Yeah, actually I just moved in last weekend. Still got boxes everywhere and, um, honestly I'm kind of drowning in packing peanuts, but it's nice to finally meet someone from the building!

Character 1: That's so exciting! Which floor are you on?

Character 2: Third floor, apartment 3B. The one with the, uh, slightly crooked doormat that I keep meaning to straighten but somehow never do—it's become like this weird daily ritual of noticing it and ignoring it.

Character 1: Oh my gosh, I'm right above you in 4B! We're neighbors!

Character 2: No way! Well that's, hmm, that's actually perfect because I was going to ask—do you ever hear like this weird humming sound at night? I can't tell if it's the pipes or, I mean, maybe I'm just imagining things.

Character 1: The radiator! Yes! It drives me absolutely bonkers sometimes but you get used to it.

Character 2: Ah, okay, so I'm not going crazy then! Gosh, I was starting to think maybe the place was haunted or something, which, you know, would've been interesting but also terrifying.

Character 1: [whispering loudly] Between you and me, Mrs. Chen in 2A says it IS haunted!

Character 2: Oh man, erhm, please don't tell me that while I'm still sleeping on an air mattress! Though honestly, a friendly ghost might be nice company while I'm unpacking all these boxes.

Character 1: You're still on an air mattress? Oh honey, do you need any help setting up?

Character 2: [cry] That's so sweet of you to offer! I'm actually waiting for the delivery guys who were supposed to come yesterday but, well, apparently my couch is stuck in some warehouse in Jersey.

Character 1: That's the worst! I have an extra folding chair if you need somewhere proper to sit?

Character 2: Right right.

Character 1: [monotone] I also have some spare dishes and kitchen stuff if you need anything.

Character 2: You're literally being so kind right now, I can't even—most people in the city just, um, avoid eye contact and keep walking, but here you are offering me actual furniture and dishes!

Character 1: Well, we're neighbors now! Plus, you seem really nice.

Character 2: Aw, thank you! Hey, once I get my kitchen somewhat functional, I make a pretty decent lasagna if you'd like to come over for dinner sometime? I mean, assuming the oven works properly.

Character 1: I would absolutely love that! I'll bring dessert!

Character 2: Perfect! And seriously, thank you for being so welcoming—moving to a new place is, mmm, always a bit overwhelming, but meeting you has already made this feel more like home.
