Character 1: Do you remember what happened on our 47th anniversary? I've been trying to piece together the timeline.

Character 2: Oh, well, the 47th—that was, you know, when we accidentally turned the entire banquet hall into, er, a flock of flamingos! Still had to pay for 300 dinners even though nobody could eat them, remember?

Character 1: That was the 47th? I thought the flamingo incident was year 52!

Character 2: No no, year 52 was when I miscalculated the levitation spell and we spent our anniversary dinner floating on the ceiling for three hours! The waiter had to use a ladder to bring us champagne.

Character 1: Ugh, I mean, now I'm [groan] completely confused about, um, which disaster happened when.

Character 2: Actually, I keep [delighted] a detailed log—year 23 was, you know, the dragon egg omelet incident, year 31 was when we, hmm, time-traveled backwards through our own wedding!

Character 1: Wait, so, what about year, uh, let me think—year 38, that was, basically, something with ice sculptures?

Character 2: Year 38, yes! I animated all twelve ice sculptures at the winter gala and they started waltzing with the guests—took me four hours to reverse that spell!

Character 1: The dean's wife [laugh hard] danced with an ice swan for twenty minutes before realizing!

Character 2: She actually requested I bring it back for year 39's party, said it was the best dance partner she'd had in decades!

Character 1: Okay but, er, year 44—that one's, like, completely blank in my memory, honestly.

Character 2: Year 44 was, well, relatively quiet—I only [overly polite] accidentally set fire to three tablecloths, which, um, by our standards, basically counts as a successful evening!

Character 1: Three tablecloths? That's, you know, [gasp softly] what you call quiet? I guess, er, our standards have really shifted.

Character 2: Well, hmm, compared to year 19 when I [curious] summoned 2,000 butterflies instead of 20, or, actually, year 67 when the cake grew legs and ran away!

Character 1: Year 67—so, that's in the future? You're, I mean, mixing up timelines again, um, aren't you?

Character 2: Oh right, er, sometimes I [friendly] forget which memories are from this timeline—time magic makes anniversaries, you know, rather complicated to track chronologically!

Character 1: How many anniversaries have we actually had versus how many you remember from various timelines?

Character 2: In this particular reality, we've had 58 anniversaries, but I remember at least 200 from various temporal loops and parallel dimensions!

Character 1: Two hundred? That's, well, actually kind of romantic in a, honestly, bizarre wizard way.

Character 2: Each one special in its own catastrophic way—though I must say, the constants are always you, me, and something inevitably catching fire!
