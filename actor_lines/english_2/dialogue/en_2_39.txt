Character 1: Have you ever tried sculpture? I'm thinking about signing up for a clay class.

Character 2: Oh that's exciting! I took a ceramics [gasp softly] workshop last year and ended up covered head to toe in clay slip. What kind of sculpture are you drawn to—figurative stuff, abstract pieces, or maybe functional pottery?

Character 1: I don't know, maybe abstract? Something that doesn't have to look like anything specific.

Character 2: Abstract sculpture is, um, so freeing! You know, have you seen those Alberto Giacometti pieces where, basically, the figures are all stretched and elongated? They're technically figurative but they feel abstract because of how he distorts reality.

Character 1: I've seen those—they're kind of [anxious] creepy, er, in a good way though, like, they capture something about, I mean, modern isolation or whatever.

Character 2: Exactly! So, speaking of isolation, actually, Barbara Hepworth used to drill holes through her sculptures to, well, represent the connection between inner and outer worlds. Have you ever tried working with negative space—like what's not there being as important as what is?

Character 1: Never thought about it that way. Holes as connection points.

Character 2: Right? And here's what [passionately] kills me—Henry Moore said sculptures should be interesting from every single angle! Can you imagine trying to make something that has no boring side, no dead zones, just continuous visual interest as you walk around it?

Character 1: That sounds impossible. Most things have a good side and a bad side.

Character 2: Tell that to Constantin Brâncuși! His "Bird in Space" pieces are basically perfect from every angle—just pure streamlined form. Have you touched any sculptures at museums when the guards weren't looking?

Character 1: Maybe once or twice. There's something about the texture.

Character 2: I knew it! The tactile quality is half the experience—rough granite versus polished marble versus rusted steel. What material are you most excited to try in your class?

Character 1: Well, clay obviously, but, hmm, I'm curious about, you know, plaster casting too—it's just that it seems more forgiving?

Character 2: Plaster is, uh, definitely more forgiving than marble! Actually, did you know Michelangelo believed he was just, sort of, releasing figures that already existed inside the stone? Imagine having that confidence—like the sculpture is already perfect and you're just the delivery mechanism!

Character 1: That's either genius or completely delusional.

Character 2: Both! Louise Bourgeois used to [cough] say that her giant spider sculptures were about protection, not fear—completely changed how I see them. What's the weirdest material you've seen used for sculpture?

Character 1: Someone made a self-portrait out of their own frozen blood once.

Character 2: Marc Quinn! He has to keep it in a special refrigerated case or his face literally melts. Speaking of unconventional materials, have you seen those ice sculptors who work with chainsaws at winter festivals?

Character 1: Those guys work [very quickly] so fast—like they're racing against temperature.

Character 2: Time pressure creates its own art! I mean, Andy Goldsworthy makes these, er, ephemeral sculptures from leaves and ice that, honestly, only exist for hours before nature reclaims them. Would you ever make something knowing it won't last?
