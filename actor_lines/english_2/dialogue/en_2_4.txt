Character 1: My roommate just told me she's moving out next month with zero warning.

Character 2: Oh god, that's the worst feeling in the world. I remember when my roommate did that to me, left me completely stranded with double rent and this crushing sense of betrayal.

Character 1: She said it was [confused] sudden but necessary. Whatever that means.

Character 2: Yeah, necessary for her, right? I mean, people always, you know, justify their selfish decisions with vague words like that, basically leaving you to pick up all the pieces.

Character 1: I guess I'm just, um, worried about finding someone new so, like, quickly.

Character 2: Finding a decent roommate is literally impossible these days. Everyone's either a complete slob or has some bizarre quirk that makes them unbearable to live with, trust me.

Character 1: Well, maybe I could, er, try living alone? I mean, it's just that the rent is, anyway, pretty steep.

Character 2: Living alone sounds [very loudly] great until you're eating ramen for the third week straight because rent consumed your entire paycheck and then some.

Character 1: There must be some good roommate options out there somewhere.

Character 2: Oh honey, I've been through, [quickly] like, seven roommates in five years, and honestly, each one was worse than the last—the stealing food, the overnight guests, you know, the passive aggressive notes.

Character 1: That sounds, um, [whispering] exhausting. Maybe I should, actually, just move back with my parents for a while.

Character 2: Moving back home? God, that's basically, er, admitting defeat, isn't it? I did it once and, you know, my mom treated me like I was sixteen again, honestly, with curfews and everything.

Character 1: Why does everything [monotone] have to be so complicated?

Character 2: Because that's life, and it only gets worse from here. Wait until you're dealing with mortgages and property taxes and homeowner associations breathing down your neck about grass height.

Character 1: You're really not, [loudly] uhh, helping with my anxiety here! The thing is, I need, well, actual solutions.

Character 2: Solutions? Here's your [furious] solution: accept that people will always disappoint you, plan for the worst case scenario, and never, ever trust anyone who says they're reliable.

Character 1: That's incredibly dark. Are you okay?

Character 2: Am I okay? No one's okay, we're all just pretending while everything falls apart around us, but at least we can be miserable together, right?

Character 1: I think, hmm, I'm going to, actually, call my sister instead. She's, er, usually more optimistic about these things.

Character 2: Your sister, really? Well, okay so, when her advice fails and you realize I was, uhh, right all along, you know where to find me—drowning in my own, basically, realistic worldview.
