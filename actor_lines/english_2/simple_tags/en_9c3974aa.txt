Scenario: A doppelganger who has been impersonating a missing person for months meets the victim's eternally optimistic best friend who refuses to believe their friend is truly gone.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Um, it's strange seeing you here after, well, [shaky voice], all these months because I thought you'd given up, [quietly], looking for me—I mean, looking. [pause]

Character 2: I knew you'd come back eventually, um, because you always, [excited], kept your promises and we said we'd meet here every year on this, [warm], exact date no matter what happened, you know.

Character 1: [slowly] The thing is, [confused], some promises become impossible to keep when circumstances change beyond what we imagined.

Character 2: [cheerful] But you're here now which proves that deep down, [passionately], you never really forgot about us or what we meant to each other.

Character 1: [bitter] Well, I suppose memories have a way of, um, [trailing off], pulling us back to places we shouldn't... I mean, [anxious], places that hold significance even when everything else has changed.

Character 2: [anticipating] You seem different but that's natural after, [relieved], everything you've been through and I'm just so, [very happy], grateful that you finally found your way back to, [delighted], yourself again. [laugh]

Character 1: [monotone] Finding one's way back implies there was, [regretful], a departure and a return when perhaps what you're seeing is, [coldly], something else entirely wearing a familiar, [whispering], face. [sigh]

Character 2: [overly polite] Um, well, that's dark.

Character 1: [defensive] Er, I'm just saying that, um, expectations can be, [frustrated], dangerous when you're hoping for something that might not actually exist anymore, you know.

Character 2: You're testing me to see if I still, [empathetically], believe in you but I've never stopped believing that underneath whatever, [sincerely], happened you're still the same person I've always known.

Character 1: [mocking] Um, your faith is touching but, well, maybe you should consider that, [sharply], the person you knew might have been an illusion all along.

Character 2: [curious] I mean, why do you keep talking about yourself like, um, [gently], you're some stranger when we've shared twenty years of friendship together, er?

Character 1: [apologetic] Well, perhaps because I've forgotten, um, [nervous], how to be the person you remember or maybe I never really was them, you know. [cough]

Character 2: [animated] Um, you're doing that thing again where you, well, [playful], deflect with philosophy when emotions get too real just like you always did, I mean.

Character 1: Er, what if I told you that, [trembling], the person you're looking for is gone and what stands before you is, um, [very quietly], just an echo wearing their skin trying desperately to, [upset], convince you otherwise, well?

Character 2: [confidently] Um, then I'd say that even echoes, well, [friendly], carry the original voice within them and maybe that's, [hopefully], enough to rebuild what was lost, you know?

Character 1: [exhausted] I mean, your optimism is both, um, [sad], admirable and heartbreaking because you refuse to see what's right in front of you, er. [gasp softly]

Character 2: Well, what I see is someone who's, [stern], been through trauma and is pushing away the people who, um, [very sincerely], love them most because accepting that love means facing what happened, you know. [long pause]

Character 1: [whispering loudly] Um, maybe some truths are better left, [bored], unspoken because once they're revealed there's no going back to, well, [melancholic], this beautiful delusion you've created. [sniffle]

Character 2: [formal] Whatever truth you're hiding behind these, [jealous], cryptic warnings won't change the fact that I'm here for you, [determined], regardless of who or what you think you've, [soft], become.
