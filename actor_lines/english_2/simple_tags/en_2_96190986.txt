Scenario: A migrant farmworker discovers that the film crew shooting on the adjacent property has been stealing water from the irrigation system during a severe drought, and confronts the best boy who's been sent to 'handle the situation.'

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [firmly] Hey, you there with the walkie-talkie! I've been watching your crew run hoses from our irrigation pumps for three days now, and, um, nobody asked permission to take that water. [frustrated] These tomatoes are barely surviving as it is.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Oh man, okay, look—I'm just the electrical department's best boy, but they told me someone might come by about this. [sighs] The location manager said they had, uh, some kind of arrangement with the property owner?

Character 1: [bitter] The property owner doesn't work these fields twelve hours a day, doesn't know that we're rationed to fifteen minutes of irrigation per section. [quietly] Your 'arrangement' is killing three months of our work, you understand that?

Character 2: [apologetic] Shit, I honestly had no idea it was that restricted. They just told us to hook up for the rain effects in scene forty-seven and, er, nobody mentioned anything about rationing.

Character 1: [passionately] Every gallon you take means another family on this farm goes without vegetables to sell at the market next month. [pause] My kids, my neighbor's kids, we all depend on this harvest to get through winter, and your movie people just, what, need some fake rain?

Character 2: [empathetically] Listen, I get it, I really do—my dad was a contractor who got pushed out by bigger companies, so I know about, um, trying to make ends meet. Let me radio the producer right now, see if we can work something else out.

Character 1: [skeptical] Right, and they'll tell you the same thing they always tell people like us—that the show must go on, that we should be grateful for the, ehh, economic opportunity of having Hollywood here.

Character 2: Actually, no, hang on—[determined] what if we trucked in our own water? We've got a massive budget for this shoot, and honestly, I can probably convince them it's cheaper than dealing with, you know, the bad publicity of destroying local crops.

Character 1: [surprised] You'd do that? Most of the crew just walks past us like we're part of the scenery, like we're not even, mmm, real people with real problems.

Character 2: [sincerely] My job is solving problems on set, and right now, this is a problem that affects real families. [quietly] Plus, I've been watching you guys work out here in this heat, and honestly, we're the ones who should be asking your permission, not the other way around.

Character 1: [warming up] That's... that's not what I expected to hear from someone in your position. [thoughtfully] You know, if you really can get them to bring in water trucks, maybe we could, uh, work out something where you use our access roads instead of tearing up the fields?

Character 2: [relieved] Now we're talking! See, that would actually help us too because those field roads are way more stable for our equipment trucks than the mud paths we've been using. [chuckles] Maybe we can both win here.

Character 1: [cautiously optimistic] I need to check with the other families first, but if you can guarantee the water trucks by tomorrow morning, I think, um, I think we can make this work for everyone.

Character 2: [confidently] Give me twenty minutes to make some calls. [warmly] And hey, what's your name? I'm Marcus, and I want to make sure you're the person I report back to, not some manager who doesn't know what's actually happening out here.

Character 1: [appreciatively] I'm Rosa. And Marcus? Thank you for, you know, actually listening.

Character 2: [earnestly] Rosa, look, we're going to be neighbors for the next six weeks of filming, and I'd rather we be good neighbors than, uh, than the alternative. [pause] Can I get your number to text you updates about those water trucks?

Character 1: [practically] Here, but text me before eight at night—after that I'm getting the kids ready for bed and, um, planning tomorrow's work schedule.

Character 2: [respectfully] Before eight, got it. And Rosa? If my department needs anything else from this area, we'll ask you first, not some office somewhere. [firmly] That's a promise from me to you.

Character 1: Alright then, Marcus. [sighs] Let's see if Hollywood money can actually do some good for once instead of just, well, taking what it needs and leaving.

Character 2: [determined] It will this time. I'll make sure of it. [quickly] And honestly, if the producers give me any pushback, I'll remind them that hiring local water trucks also means hiring local drivers, which makes them look good in the tax credit applications. [chuckles] Sometimes you just have to speak their language.
