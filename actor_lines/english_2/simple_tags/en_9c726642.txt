Scenario: A fugitive seeking to disappear forever approaches a carbon fiber specialist at a remote boat manufacturing facility, needing an untraceable vessel built for crossing international waters.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] I need something that won't show up on, um, [hesitantly], any radar systems and can handle, well, [anxious], rough seas for extended periods, I mean, without needing repairs.

Character 2: [stern] That's a very specific request for someone who just, [suspicious], walked in off the street without an appointment.

Character 1: [defensive] Look, um, I have cash and I'm willing to pay, like, [desperate], double your usual rate if you can have it ready within, er, [shaky voice], two weeks maximum. [pause]

Character 2: [formal] Building a vessel with those specifications requires, [carefully], extensive documentation for maritime regulations and, [firmly], customs clearance that I simply cannot bypass. [clearing throat]

Character 1: Well, what if we, um, [nervously], registered it as a prototype or something experimental that doesn't need all those papers?

Character 2: [frustrated] I've been in this business for, um, [proudly], twenty years and I've never risked my reputation by, well, cutting corners on legal requirements.

Character 1: [bitter] Your reputation won't matter much when the people, [trembling], looking for me find out you turned away their, [whispering], only chance of catching me. [sigh]

Character 2: [angry] Are you threatening me because that's, [slowly], definitely not going to get you what you want and now I'm, [coldly], thinking I should call security to escort you out. [long pause]

Character 1: [apologetic] No, wait, I'm sorry, um, I'm just, [exhausted], desperate here and I haven't slept in, like, [very quietly], three days trying to figure out how to, well, survive this. [gasp softly]

Character 2: You're clearly in some kind of, [empathetically], serious trouble but dragging me into whatever, [worried], mess you've created isn't something I can, [regretful], afford to do right now. [deep breath]

Character 1: [pleading] Just hear me out because, um, [passionately], I used to design composite materials for aerospace applications and I know, er, [confidently], exactly what specifications would work for what you're, well, already building here. [trailing off]

Character 2: You have experience with, [curious], aerospace composites and you're here asking me about, [confused], marine applications instead of using your own expertise?

Character 1: [sad] My lab was raided last week and they, [bitterly], froze all my assets while claiming I sold, [monotone], classified materials to foreign governments. [cough]

Character 2: [shocked] That's a federal crime that would have, [cautiously], every agency in the country looking for you right now.

Character 1: Which is exactly why I need to, um, [urgently], disappear before they realize I'm not, well, [determined], guilty of what they're accusing me of, like, doing.

Character 2: Even if what you're, [skeptically], saying is true, helping you would make me an accessory to whatever they think you've done.

Character 1: [resigned] I know what I'm asking is, um, [hopelessly], impossible but you're literally my last, er, [crying while speaking], option before I have to turn myself in for something I didn't, well, even do. [sniffle]

Character 2: [thoughtful] There might be someone who, um, [reluctantly], deals with situations like yours but it'll cost you, well, [grimly], everything you have and probably more than you're, like, prepared to pay. [heavy sigh]

Character 1: [relieved] At this point I'll pay, [eagerly], whatever it takes to get my life back.

Character 2: [grave] Once you go down this path there's, [seriously], no turning back and the people I'm thinking of don't, [ominously], give second chances. [whisper]
