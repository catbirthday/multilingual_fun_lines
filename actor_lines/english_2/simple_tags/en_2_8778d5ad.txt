Scenario: A seed investor discovers their most promising startup founder is actually in witness protection when a US Marshal arrives at their office.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] Who are you exactly?

Character 2: [formal] Deputy US Marshal Sarah Chen, and I need to speak with you about one of your portfolio companies. [pause] Specifically, the founder of DataVault Solutions, the person you know as Marcus Webb.

Character 1: [shocked] Marcus? [nervously] I just had lunch with him yesterday discussing our Series A round, we're about to wire two million dollars into his company account next week.

Character 2: [stern] That wire transfer needs to be frozen immediately, sir. [quietly] The person you know as Marcus Webb doesn't exist, at least not in the way you think he does.

Character 1: [frustrated] What the hell are you talking about? [loudly] I've done extensive background checks, reference calls, I've met his entire team, visited their offices multiple times over the past year!

Character 2: [empathetically] The background you verified is real, just not originally his. [sighs] Look, I can't discuss the specifics of his situation, but I need to know if he's mentioned any travel plans or sudden changes recently.

Character 1: This is insane, you're telling me I've invested eight hundred thousand dollars of my fund's money into someone in witness protection? [bitter] My limited partners are going to absolutely destroy me.

Character 2: [firmly] His business is legitimate, Mr. Harrison, and so is his expertise in encryption technology. [pause] The problem is someone from his past has surfaced, and we have credible intelligence they've tracked him to this city.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Jesus Christ, is he dangerous? [anxiously] Should I be worried about my other founders, my staff, my family knowing that I've been publicly associated with him?

Character 2: [reassuringly] He's not the threat.

Character 1: [desperately] But his company is the cornerstone of my entire fund strategy, we've been featured in TechCrunch, Forbes, everywhere talking about this revolutionary encryption platform. [exhales] If this gets out, my reputation is finished.

Character 2: [quietly] Your reputation is the least of our concerns right now, Mr. Harrison. [very seriously] The people looking for him have killed three witnesses in the past eighteen months, and they don't care about collateral damage.

Character 1: [whispering] Oh my God.

Character 2: [quickly] Which is why I need you to act completely normal for the next forty-eight hours while we relocate him. [firmly] Can you do that without tipping anyone off, including Marcus himself?

Character 1: [hesitantly] You want me to pretend everything's fine while you're telling me there are killers potentially watching his every move? [sarcastically] Sure, no pressure there.

Character 2: [stern] This isn't a request, Mr. Harrison, it's a matter of national security and multiple lives are at stake. [pause] Marcus testified against a major international crime syndicate, and his testimony put away people you've definitely read about.

Character 1: [defeated] So what happens to DataVault, to the technology, to the fifteen employees who think they're building the future? [quietly] They don't deserve to have their lives destroyed because their boss is secretly someone else.

Character 2: [empathetically] The technology and the company can continue, potentially under new leadership if you move quickly. [sighs] But Marcus, or whoever he becomes next, won't be part of it after Tuesday.

Character 1: [bitterly] Three years of work, countless hours of mentorship, and he never said a word. [very quietly] I actually thought we were friends beyond just the business relationship.

Character 2: [warmly] For what it's worth, everything I've seen in our surveillance suggests he genuinely cares about you and this company. [pause] Sometimes the best way to protect people is to never let them know they need protection.
