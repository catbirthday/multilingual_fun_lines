=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [regretful] Sarah, you came back after all these, [trembling], years of silence between us when I thought you'd, [bitter], never forgive me for missing your recital that night. [long pause]

Character 2: Grandpa, um, I'm not Sarah, I mean, Mom passed away three years ago and, [confused], we've talked about this before when, [very quietly], you were having a better day.

Character 1: [angry] Don't lie to me about who you are because I can see your mother's, [frustrated], eyes looking back at me through that same disappointed, [slowly], expression she always wore.

Character 2: [warm] I'm Emily, your granddaughter, and I have Mom's eyes because she was my mother, [whispering], but I'm not her.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Sarah?

Character 2: [empathetically] The piano you gave me for my sixteenth birthday is still in perfect, [hesitantly], condition and I practice on it every day just like you, [crying while speaking], taught me when I was little.

Character 1: That old Steinway was supposed to be, [anxious], yours after I retired from touring but the touring never, [exhausted], stopped until it was too late to teach you, [stern], everything I knew.

Character 2: You did teach me Grandpa, every Sunday afternoon for twelve years until the, [relieved], tremors started and even then you'd sit beside me and, [passionately], guide my hands through the difficult passages.

Character 1: [very melancholic] Gone.

Character 2: [formal] I brought the recording from Carnegie Hall, um, the one where you played Rachmaninoff's Third and, well, [upset], afterward you dedicated it to your family who you said, [monotone], gave up so much for your career. [sigh]

Character 1: [curious] That performance was the night Sarah was born and I missed it because the concert had been, [quickly], rescheduled and I couldn't cancel on three thousand people. [gasp]

Character 2: [apologetic] Mom understood eventually that music wasn't just your job but the, [mocking], very essence of who you were and she wanted me to, [loudly], know you as that person too. [groan]

Character 1: [cheerful] You play just like her with that same light touch on the keys that makes even the, [whispering loudly], darkest pieces sound hopeful somehow.

Character 2: [sad] She never played piano Grandpa, that was always just, [very sad], our thing together.

Character 1: [overly polite] Of course, forgive me, my mind sometimes plays these, [trailing off], cruel tricks where past and present blur together like...

Character 2: Like, um, a jazz improvisation where, I mean, the melody keeps shifting but, [delighted], the underlying harmony stays constant.

Character 1: [confidently] Yes, exactly like that, um, and sometimes I hear the music so, [clearing throat], clearly but I can't quite place which performance or, well, [shouting], which decade it's from anymore.

Character 2: [very sincerely] Well, you know, we can make new music together, um, even if it's just me playing and, [sleepily], you listening and maybe humming along when, [jealous], the melody feels familiar.

Character 1: [friendly] Sarah always said that, er, wait no, that was you who said that last week when, um, [condescending], you brought me that same recording and I, [speeding up], forgot again didn't I?

Character 2: It doesn't matter because every time feels, [playful], like the first time you remember and that joy on your face when you, [stuttering], hear that opening movement is worth, [deep pitch], reliving this moment a thousand times.
