Scenario: A domestic student returns to their former music teacher after dropping out of a prestigious music conservatory, seeking guidance about whether to give up music entirely.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Ms. Rodriguez, I, um, I know I haven't been in touch since I left the conservatory, but I needed to talk to someone who understands what music actually means, you know?

Character 2: [warmly] Come in, come in.

Character 1: The thing is, everyone at home keeps saying I threw away this incredible opportunity, and maybe they're right, but I just [sighs] couldn't breathe there anymore, couldn't find myself in all those expectations.

Character 2: [gently] Sometimes the most prestigious path isn't the right one, and it takes real courage to admit that. [pause] What were you hoping to find when you auditioned for that place?

Character 1: [frustrated] I thought I'd find people who loved music the way I did, but it was all competition and rankings and who could practice sixteen hours without breaking. Nobody actually listened to what we were playing, just how technically perfect it was.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] You know, I turned down Juilliard twice because I saw what it did to my friends, how it turned their passion into anxiety. [softly] Music should feed your soul, not consume it.

Character 1: [shaky voice] But what if I'm just making excuses? What if I'm actually not good enough and I'm using this whole 'it wasn't right for me' thing as a way to avoid facing that I failed?

Character 2: [firmly] Listen to me, I've taught hundreds of students over twenty years, and you had something special that went beyond technique. [passionately] The way you played Chopin's Ballade made people cry, including me, remember?

Character 1: [very quietly] My parents spent their entire savings on that first year, remortgaged the house, and now I'm back here with nothing to show for it. [voice breaking] How do I even begin to justify that?

Character 2: [empathetically] Oh sweetheart, the only thing worse than losing money is losing yourself, and from what you're telling me, you were dangerously close to that. Your parents want you happy, not just successful.

Character 1: [bitter] Happy? I haven't touched the piano in three months because every time I sit down, I hear my professor's voice telling me I'm rushing the tempo or my fingering is sloppy or whatever.

Character 2: [animated] Then we need to help you remember why you started playing in the first place, before all the judges and critics got into your head. [excitedly] Do you remember that summer when you learned jazz just for fun?

Character 1: [surprised] You remember that? God, I, um, I used to sneak into the practice rooms at midnight just to play Bill Evans transcriptions without anyone hearing me butcher them. [small laugh] That was before everything got so serious.

Character 2: [cheerfully] And you weren't butchering anything, you were experimenting, which is exactly what jazz is about! [leaning forward] What if we started meeting again, no pressure, no grades, just playing music that makes you feel something?

Character 1: [hesitant] I don't know if I can afford lessons right now, and honestly, I'm not even sure I deserve your time after disappearing the way I did. I didn't even thank you properly for writing that recommendation letter.

Character 2: [dismissively] Forget about money, this isn't about lessons, it's about helping you find your way back to something you love. [warmly] And that recommendation letter? I meant every word, still do.

Character 1: [relieved] Maybe we could try, I mean, just once or twice to see if I can even [exhales] play without panicking. Would Tuesday afternoons work? That's when you used to have your free period.

Character 2: [smiling speaking] Tuesday afternoons are perfect, and we'll start with something simple, maybe some Satie or even just improvisation. [gently] The goal is to remember that music is a conversation, not a performance.

Character 1: [emotional] Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez, I, um, I really thought I'd lost this part of myself forever, but talking to you makes me think maybe, just maybe, I can find my way back to it somehow.

Character 2: [very sincerely] You never lose it completely.
