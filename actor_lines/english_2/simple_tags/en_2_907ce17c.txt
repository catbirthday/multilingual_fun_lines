Scenario: A granddaughter confronts the middleman who was supposed to help sell her late grandmother's antique shop inventory but instead sold everything to private collectors before the estate was settled.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] You sold everything.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Your father gave me explicit instructions to liquidate the inventory as quickly as possible. [clearing throat] The collectors I worked with, they paid above market value for most pieces.

Character 1: [bitter] Above market value doesn't bring back the Victorian writing desk where she taught me cursive, or the music box that played at her wedding. [shaky voice] Those weren't just inventory items to be liquidated.

Character 2: [apologetic] Look, I understand you're upset, but estate sales are complicated and your father wanted everything settled before the property taxes came due. [sighs] He never mentioned you'd want to keep anything.

Character 1: [angry] Because he didn't know I existed until the funeral! [voice breaking] Grandma raised me for twelve years while he was off playing businessman in Singapore, and now you're telling me he had the authority to erase every trace of her?

Character 2: [very quietly] The will listed him as sole beneficiary, and legally that meant I had to follow his directives regardless of any family dynamics I wasn't aware of.

Character 1: [defeated] She promised me the pearl-handled letter opener that her mother brought from Poland, said it would be mine when I graduated college. [pause] I graduate next month and now some collector has it in a display case somewhere.

Character 2: [regretful] Actually, that piece...

Character 1: [furious] What? You remember that specific piece out of hundreds you rushed to sell? [bitter] Or are you about to tell me it fetched an especially good price that somehow makes this all worthwhile?

Character 2: [slowly] I kept it aside because the inscription was in Polish and I couldn't properly catalog it for sale. [quietly] It's in my office safe along with a few other pieces that needed translation or authentication.

Character 1: [shocked] You still have it? [trembling] After three weeks of me calling and begging for any information about where her things went, you're just now mentioning you kept some items?

Character 2: [frustrated] Your father explicitly told me not to engage with any family members claiming rights to the estate! [exhales] I'm violating my contract just by having this conversation with you right now.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] That letter opener has my great-grandmother's name etched in the handle, and inside the velvet case there's a photograph from 1947 of three generations holding it. [pause] Grandma showed it to me every birthday.

Character 2: [warmly] There's also a mahogany jewelry box with a false bottom, some handwritten recipe cards in what looks like Polish, and a set of amber rosary beads. [sighs] They're all still in my safe.

Character 1: [very quietly] The recipes are for pierogi and makowiec, she made them every Christmas even after her arthritis got bad. [shaky voice] She'd grip that wooden spoon like her life depended on getting the dough just right.

Character 2: [empathetically] Listen, I can't legally give you these items, but if you happened to know where my office is and I happened to leave for lunch at exactly 12:30 tomorrow with the safe accidentally left open...

Character 1: [hesitantly] You'd risk your license for this? [confused] My father would destroy your reputation if he found out, and we both know he's vindictive enough to follow through.

Character 2: [firmly] Twenty-three years in this business and I've never felt this wrong about a sale. [pause] Your grandmother's shop wasn't just inventory, anyone could see that from how carefully she'd labeled everything with its history.

Character 1: [tearfully] She wrote the story of every piece on those little cream-colored tags in her perfect handwriting, said objects without stories were just clutter taking up space in the world.

Character 2: [very sincerely] 12:30 tomorrow, side entrance on Maple Street, second floor. [quietly] The letter opener deserves to graduate with someone who understands its story.
