Scenario: A leather worker delivers custom plant carriers to a greenhouse, only to discover the manager is their ex-partner who vanished five years ago to save the family business.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] I have the custom plant carriers you ordered but I wasn't expecting, [shaky voice], to see you here after all these years.

Character 2: [very quietly] Well, um, I didn't know you were still, [pause], making leather goods or that you'd be the one delivering them today, you know? [sigh]

Character 1: [frustrated] You left without a word five years ago and now you're, [bitter], acting like we're strangers who just need to complete a, [trembling], business transaction.

Character 2: [defensive] Look, I mean, the family greenhouse was dying and I had to, [anxious], make a choice between staying with you or saving what my grandmother, [slowly], built with her bare hands. [trailing off]

Character 1: The night you disappeared I waited at the restaurant for, [confused], three hours thinking something terrible had happened until your sister finally, [angry], told me you'd chosen plants over people and that I should just, [whispering], move on.

Character 2: [apologetic] I know, um, what I did was cruel but the bank was going to, [quickly], foreclose the next morning and I couldn't face telling you, er, that I was leaving. [groan]

Character 1: [sad] Every piece of leather I work reminds me of the journal cover I was, [warm], making for your birthday that year.

Character 2: Well, I mean, I still have all the pressed flowers from our first date tucked, [very melancholic], inside my grandmother's botanical encyclopedia, you know?

Character 1: [curious] Why did you order from my shop when there are dozens of other leather workers in the city who could have, [nervously], made these carriers without all this history between us making everything so, [passionately], complicated and painful?

Character 2: [very sincerely] Because I've been following your work online for years and watching you become this, [excited], incredible artisan while I've been here trying to rebuild what was almost, [regretful], lost forever made me realize how much we both sacrificed.

Character 1: [stern] Following my work doesn't give you the right to suddenly reappear and expect, [loudly], everything to be normal between us.

Character 2: The greenhouse is finally thriving again and I thought maybe if I, [exhausted], reached out through a business order first we could find our way back to something.

Character 1: [upset] So, um, this whole order was just an elaborate way to, [whispering loudly], manipulate me into seeing you again after you couldn't even send a single text message explaining why you, [crying while speaking], vanished from my life?

Character 2: [empathetically] I mean, er, I wrote you hundreds of messages over the years but never sent them because, [deep pitch], what could I possibly say that would undo the damage, you know? [long pause]

Character 1: [relieved] At least you thought about reaching out even if you never, [monotone], actually did it.

Character 2: [playful] Remember how you used to say leather tells stories through its scars and, [cheerful], imperfections just like people do? [chuckle]

Character 1: Those carriers I made have hidden pockets with the same, [friendly], pattern we used to doodle on napkins at that coffee shop where we'd sit for hours planning our, [hopeful], future together before everything fell apart.

Character 2: [delighted] Well, um, I noticed the pattern immediately and that's when I knew you still, [animated], remembered everything we shared despite how badly I hurt you when I, [sarcastic], chose to save dead plants over our living relationship, you know? [laugh]

Character 1: [confident] The greenhouse might be thriving but what about you because from where I'm standing you look, [worried], exhausted and lost.

Character 2: [sleepily] I mean, saving this place took everything I had and now that it's stable I realize I've been, [very sad], completely alone here surrounded by all this life I fought to preserve, er, while letting the most important person slip away, you know? [gasp softly]
