Subject: Your valet service client just accused you of stealing jewelry you've never even seen

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] What? I'm sorry, what did you just—jewelry? [confused] I don't even, like, I haven't seen any jewelry, ma'am. [nervous] Look, okay, I've been doing this job for, um, three years, and I've never—I mean, honestly, I would never take anything from anyone's car. [defensive] The thing is, I literally just parked your vehicle and brought you the keys, right? [frustrated] So when exactly would I have even had time to—to what, [upset] go through your belongings? 

[hurt] This is really, er, it's actually kind of insulting that you'd think... [pause] Look, I understand you're missing something, [empathetically] and that's terrible, I really do get that, but accusing me? [angry] I have a family, you know? I have kids, and this job—[shaky voice] if you make this kind of accusation, it could ruin my whole... [trailing off]

[firmly] Here's the thing, we have cameras everywhere, [confident] so why don't we just check those? Because I guarantee—and I mean, absolutely guarantee—[very sincerely] you're not going to see me taking anything. [bitter] Maybe you should, hmm, check when you last actually had this jewelry, because [stern] I'm telling you right now, I never touched it. Never even saw it.
