Subject: The restructuring advisor role where you actually saved jobs instead of cutting them for once

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] God, I can't believe we actually pulled it off. I mean, usually I'm the—the grim reaper, right? [bitter] That's what they call me behind my back, I know they do. "Here comes the hatchet man." But this time, [pause] this time was different. 

So we went in there, and honestly, the numbers were—[frustrated] they were terrible, okay? Like, hemorrhaging money terrible. And normally, well, [sighs] normally I'd already have the termination packages drafted. But then Sarah, [animated] she shows me this restructuring plan where we actually, um, we move people around instead of out. [chuckle] The manufacturing guys become logistics support, the admin team—they're now client-facing. 

[very sincerely] You should've seen their faces when I announced it. They were bracing for—I don't know, basically expecting the worst. [emotional] And then I said "no layoffs," and this one woman just, [cry] she started crying. Said her kid just got into college and she'd been, er, terrified for weeks.

[quietly] Twenty-three years I've been doing this. Twenty-three years of "cutting fat" and "right-sizing" and all those, [sarcastic] those lovely euphemisms for destroying lives. [warm] But today? Today I actually helped people. Really helped them. [long pause] Maybe I'm not just the grim reaper after all.
