Subject: Learning your late mentor left you their entire book collection because you were the student who most reminded them of themselves

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] The lawyer just called and, um, apparently Professor Chen left me—[very quietly] she left me everything. Her entire library. I mean, [shaky voice] thousands of books, all those first editions she'd, like, show me with those cotton gloves on. [pause] The note said I was the student who most, er, reminded her of herself, and I just—[crying while speaking] how did I not know she saw me that way? 

You know, she'd always say I read books the same way she did, like, [warm] hungry for them, desperate almost. [laugh] God, I remember staying after her lectures just to, well, argue about translations and she'd get this look, [sniffle] this sort of proud look that I never really understood until—until now, I guess.

[slowly] The thing is, she never had kids, and honestly, I never thought about what would happen to all those books. [very melancholic] They're being delivered next week. Her whole collection. Even that, hmm, that signed copy of Neruda she'd never let anyone touch. [relieved] It's like she's still teaching me something, you know? About, I don't know, legacy or—[whispering] or maybe about how we find ourselves in other people sometimes. Actually, maybe that's what she meant. That she saw her younger self in me, all that, er, desperate hunger for words and meaning and—God, I'm going to miss her so much.
