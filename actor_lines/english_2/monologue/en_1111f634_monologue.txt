Subject: The community garden you started in an empty lot just got city funding to expand into a neighborhood food program

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp loudly] They said yes! The city actually—I mean, I just got off the phone and they're giving us the funding! Like, the whole thing, not just, you know, partial. [laugh] Twenty thousand dollars! For our little garden! Well, it's not so little anymore, I guess. 

Um, God, I keep thinking about that first day when it was literally just me and Mrs. Chen with our shovels, [very quietly] staring at all those weeds and broken glass. And everyone thought we were crazy—"why would you waste your time on that dump?" they said. [pause] But we kept showing up, right? Every Saturday. Then Marcus joined, and the Rodriguez family, and suddenly we had, like, thirty people digging in the dirt together.

[cry] Sorry, I'm just—the thing is, we can actually do the food pantry now. And the cooking classes! [excited] Oh my God, the kids are going to flip when they hear about the youth program! We're gonna teach them how to grow their own food, and then, [speeding up] honestly, who knows? Maybe they'll start their own gardens someday. 

[warm] It's just... this empty lot that everyone forgot about, er, it's going to feed our whole neighborhood now. [sniffle] We really did it.
