[shaky voice] Do you understand what you're saying? I've been at this school for three years, [frustrated] perfect record, never even had a late assignment, and now you're telling me— [pause] wait, what exactly are you accusing me of? \n\n[angry] That paper was mine. Every word, every source, I spent weeks on it! [very loudly] I have the drafts on my computer! [trembling] I have the library checkout receipts, the—the research notes in my handwriting! [upset] Why would I risk everything I've worked for? \n\n[crying while speaking] My parents are going to think—God, they're going to think I actually did this. [bitter] You know what the worst part is? I stayed up until 4 AM finishing that paper, [exhausted] turned down parties, basically lived in the library, and for what? [furious] To be sitting here defending my integrity to people who've already decided I'm guilty?\n\n[determined] I want to see the evidence. [stern] Whatever you think you have, I want to see it right now. Because I know, [passionately] I know I didn't cheat, and I'll prove it."
