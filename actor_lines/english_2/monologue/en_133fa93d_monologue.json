[empathetically] The mom was crying, just sobbing, you know? And honestly, their mortgage situation was—[pause]—it was one of the worst I'd seen. [exhausted] Three kids, medical bills from the youngest's surgery, and then, um, the dad lost his job right after they'd refinanced. [sighs] The thing is, bankruptcy seemed inevitable, really. But we just kept, er, digging through every option. [warm] Called the lender seventeen times—seventeen!—and basically wore them down until they agreed to restructure. [chuckle] I guess persistence pays off, right?

[happy] The kids don't have to change schools, they don't have to leave their neighborhood, and honestly, it's like watching someone get their life back. [slowly] You know what the dad said to me? [smiling speaking] He said I gave them hope when they had none left. [passionate] That's what matters, isn't it? Not the numbers or the paperwork, but actually, um, changing lives.
