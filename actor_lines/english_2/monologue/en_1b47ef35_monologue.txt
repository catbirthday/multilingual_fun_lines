Subject: Your rigging artist safety protocols were ignored, resulting in a performer's serious injury that could have been prevented

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [angry] I wrote it all down. Every single safety check, every—every load calculation, the inspection schedule, I mean, it was all there in black and white. [bitter] Twenty years I've been doing this job, and they just... [pause] they completely ignored it. [shaky voice] Sarah's in the hospital now with a shattered pelvis because someone decided my protocols were, what, [sarcastic] too time-consuming? 

[frustrated] I keep replaying it, you know? That moment when the rigging failed, the sound it made—[gasp softly] God, the way she fell. [very sad] Thirty feet. She fell thirty feet because they didn't want to spend an extra hour on safety checks. [furious] An hour! That's all it would have taken, um, to prevent this whole—[trailing off] 

[crying while speaking] I tried to tell them. The day before, I literally stood in that production meeting and said the equipment needed inspection. [bitter] But no, we were behind schedule, over budget, whatever. [regretful] Maybe I should have refused to let the show go on, just... walked out or something. [very quietly] I keep thinking about her kids, how she might never perform again. [exhausted] All because my safety protocols were treated like suggestions instead of, er, requirements. [pause] I don't know if I can do this job anymore.
