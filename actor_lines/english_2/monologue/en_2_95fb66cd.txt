=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] When Sarah called me about the promotion, I literally screamed! Like, full-on jumped up from my desk and everything. [laugh] God, my coworkers probably thought I was insane. But I couldn't help it—she'd been working toward this for three years, three years of just grinding and hoping and— [warmly] She deserved it so much. I sent her like fifteen celebration emojis. [chuckle] Maybe overkill, but whatever. 

[pause] 

And then yesterday she texts me out of nowhere. Says her old position is opening up and she already talked to her boss about me. [confused] I was like, wait, what? Me? [slowly] But she said—she said she remembered how genuinely happy I was for her. Not fake happy, not the kind where people say congratulations but you can tell they're, um... they're actually bitter about it. [sincerely] She said that meant something to her. 

[quietly] I just sent some emojis, you know? 

[speeding up] But now she's introducing me to the whole team next week, and they're actually interested in my portfolio, and it's exactly the kind of work I've been dreaming about— [gasp softly] This could change everything. [very slowly] All because I was just... happy for my friend. Really, truly happy. [emotional] Weird how that works.
