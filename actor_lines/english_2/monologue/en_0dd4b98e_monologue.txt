Subject: The master craftsman whose workshop you've been apprenticing at for six years just told you that you'll never have the natural talent needed

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very quietly] Six years. I mean, six fucking years I've been... [pause] He actually said that to me. Like, to my face. "You don't have it." That's—that's what he said. [bitter] After all the late nights, um, all the pieces I ruined learning, and he just... [sigh] 

I don't know, maybe I always knew? Like, deep down? [very melancholic] The way he'd watch me work, you know, with this expression that was sort of... disappointed. But I thought—well, I figured if I just kept at it, right? [frustrated] If I just practiced more than everyone else, then honestly, talent wouldn't matter.

[shaky voice] The thing is, I love this work. I mean, I really—God, I shaped my whole life around this workshop. [angry] And now what? Start over? Pretend these six years were just, I guess, some kind of extended hobby? [laugh] That's rich.

[slowly] Maybe he's wrong though. Like, maybe natural talent is just... [trailing off] No. No, he'd know. After forty years, er, he'd know who has it and who's just... [very sad] trying really hard.

[whispering] What the hell do I do now?
