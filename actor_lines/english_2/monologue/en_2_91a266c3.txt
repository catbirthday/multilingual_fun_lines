Subject: Your cover band finally gets a record deal, but it means leaving your day job and financial security behind

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Three years of playing dive bars and suddenly Atlantic wants to sign us. [excited] Atlantic Records! [laugh] I mean, we're just a cover band that does eighties hits at weddings. [confused] How is this even real? [pause] But then there's the, um... there's the contract thing. [anxious] They want us touring for six months straight. [shaky voice] Six months away from home, away from everything stable. I've been at the accounting firm for what, seven years now? [frustrated] God, I hate that place, but it's... it's steady money, you know? [sigh] Benefits, retirement plan, all that adult stuff my parents keep reminding me about. [hesitantly] And Sarah, she's being supportive but I can tell she's, uh... she's worried. [sad] We just got the mortgage last year. [slowly] What if the album tanks? [worried] What if we're just another band that gets dropped after one record? [pause] But then I think about being forty and still sitting in that cubicle, wondering what would've happened if I'd just, hmm... if I'd taken the shot. [passionate] This is literally the dream, right? [laugh nervously] The actual dream I've had since I was fifteen. [quietly] So why am I so terrified? [long pause] I think I already know what I'm gonna do. [resigned] I just wish it didn't feel like jumping off a cliff.
