[very melancholic] The way he'd watch me work, you know, with this expression that was sort of... disappointed. But I thought—well, I figured if I just kept at it, right? [frustrated] If I just practiced more than everyone else, then honestly, talent wouldn't matter.\n\n[shaky voice] The thing is, I love this work.
