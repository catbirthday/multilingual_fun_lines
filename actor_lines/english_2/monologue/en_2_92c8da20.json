[frustrated] And now they're telling me I can't even touch a forklift because Jimmy didn't secure his load properly? [angry] He admitted it! He literally stood there and told them he forgot to check the chains! [pause] But somehow—somehow I'm the one who loses everything. [very sad] My whole career, just... gone. Because I happened to be operating the crane when his mistake caused the accident. [sigh] They keep saying it's \"protocol\" and \"liability concerns.\" [mocking] \"Nothing personal, just following procedure.\" [furious] Following procedure? Where was the procedure when they let Jimmy walk away with a warning? [shaky voice] I've got two kids in college. Mortgage payments. My wife's, um... she's trying to be supportive but I can see it in her eyes. [quietly] She's scared. [long pause] And the worst part? [bitter] The union rep just shrugged and said there's nothing they can do. Twenty-three years of dues, and they won't even file an appeal. [exhausted] I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. Start over at fifty-two? [sarcastic] Yeah, that'll be easy. [determined] But I'm not giving up. I'll fight this somehow."
