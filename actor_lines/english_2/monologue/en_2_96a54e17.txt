=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Three point seven meters. That's all I had to check. Three point seven, not seven point three. God, I keep seeing their faces when they came to the office. [very sad] The way the old man just... stood there, you know? Didn't even yell. His wife was crying but he just—he just stared at me. [pause] And I wanted to say something but what do you even... I mean, forty years they'd been working that land. Forty years gone because I was, um, I was tired? Because I rushed through the readings? 

[regretful] I keep telling myself it could've happened to anyone. [bitter] But it didn't happen to anyone, did it? It happened because of me. [sigh] The insurance won't cover it all, apparently. Something about acts of—I don't know, they're calling it human error which... yeah. That's exactly what it was. 

[very quietly] Their daughter had to drop out of college. [shaky voice] She was studying to be a veterinarian and now she's... she's working at the hardware store to help them rebuild. Because of three seconds of me not double-checking. Three seconds. 

[anxious] I offered to quit but my supervisor said that wouldn't help anyone. So I just... go to work every day and check those levels and wonder if they hate me as much as I hate myself right now.
