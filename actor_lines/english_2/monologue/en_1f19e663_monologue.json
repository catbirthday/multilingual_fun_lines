[pause] I mean, yeah, I overruled the initial denial for the cardiac MRI—and honestly, thank God I did because they found a blockage that would've killed him within days. [passionately] Within DAYS. But here's the thing, my supervisor won't even look at me now. Like, she just... [trailing off] \n\n[frustrated] I get it, okay? I went over her head. I, uh, basically told the medical director that her assessment was wrong. [very quietly] Which it was. [normal voice] But now she's treating me like I'm some kind of, I don't know, traitor or something. And it's just—[sigh] the man is alive because I pushed back. His kids still have a father, you know? \n\n[sad] I keep thinking about the meeting yesterday where she said, [mocking] \"I can't trust someone who undermines my decisions.\" [normal voice] Really? That's what this is about? Not the patient who's, er, literally walking around right now because I fought for him? \n\n[very melancholic] I guess I thought... [pause] I thought she'd eventually see that I did the right thing. [whispering] But maybe that doesn't matter anymore."
