=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very quietly] I just... I can't believe this is real. [pause] Twenty-three thousand people. [laugh] That's not even—I mean, when I started making these stupid little organizers for my ADHD brain, I was literally just trying to not lose my keys every morning. [emotional] And now there's this woman in, um... in Nebraska who sent me this message saying I changed her life. [voice breaking] Her life. Because of some, like, color-coded sticky note system I made up at 2 AM. [sniffle] 

It's so weird because, hmm, I never thought anyone else had this exact problem, you know? [speeding up] Like the way I'd put things down and they'd just disappear into some void and I'd spend forty minutes every morning just— [frustrated] God, I hated myself for it. [pause] 

[very sincerely] But all these people, they're sending photos of their setups and they're... they're crying in the videos. [gasp softly] This one dad said his teenager finally, um, finally feels normal. [emotional] Normal. Because of something I made in my garage. [long pause]

[whispering] I don't know what to do with this. [laugh] Twenty-three thousand people who were struggling exactly like I was. [overwhelmed] And we're all just... we're okay now.
