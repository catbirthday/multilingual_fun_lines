Subject: Learning that your window cleaning route is being automated and your 15-year career is obsolete

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Wait, what do you—automated? Like, you mean... robots? [pause] I don't, um, I don't understand what you're saying here. Fifteen years, okay? I've been doing this route for fifteen years. [shaky voice] Mrs. Henderson on the third floor, she—she always waves at me, you know? Every Tuesday. And the corner office building, I mean, that's my—[frustrated] that's MY building, I know every single window, every streak pattern, where the sun hits at what time—

[angry] You can't just—a machine doesn't know these things! It doesn't, like, understand when to skip the Johnsons' window because their baby's sleeping, or—or how Mr. Chen likes extra attention on his storefront because, well, customers notice that stuff. [pause] 

[bitter] Fifteen years. [sigh] I taught my nephew this job last summer, told him it was, uh, it was honest work, steady work. [very sad] What am I supposed to—I'm forty-three years old, what exactly am I... [trailing off]

[quietly] My dad did windows too, actually. Different era, I guess. [long pause] So when does this, er, when does the automation thing start? [defeated] Next month? [sniffle] Right. Of course. That's... yeah. That's really something.
