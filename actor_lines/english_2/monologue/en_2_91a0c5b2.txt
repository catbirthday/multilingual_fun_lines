Subject: Your judge ruling being upheld by the Supreme Court and setting precedent for civil rights protection

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp loudly] They upheld it. They actually— [pause] Nine to zero. Unanimous. [shaky voice] I keep reading it over and over because I can't quite believe what I'm seeing. All those months of criticism, the death threats, people saying I was overreaching, that I was— [sigh] And now it's precedent. [very quietly] Real, binding precedent that's going to protect people. 

[warm] You know, when I wrote that opinion, I was just trying to do what was right. What the law demanded. But then it became this, um... this lightning rod for everything wrong with the country, supposedly. [laugh] My kids had to change schools. Can you imagine? [pause] But sitting here now, knowing that somewhere there's a kid who won't have to hide who they are, or a family that won't be torn apart because of this— [sniffle] 

[passionately] This is why we do this job. Not for the recognition or the— the politics of it all. We do it because sometimes, just sometimes, you get to be part of something that actually matters. [long pause] Twenty years from now, law students will read this case. [extremely happy] And they won't know about the sleepless nights or the, uh... the doubt. They'll just know it as settled law. [very sincerely] That's the most beautiful thing I can imagine.
