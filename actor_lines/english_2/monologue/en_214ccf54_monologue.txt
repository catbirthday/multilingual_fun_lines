Subject: Your rescued shelter dog alerting you to a gas leak that could have killed your whole family

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I still can't believe it. Three in the morning and Bailey just wouldn't stop barking. [exhausted] He's pawing at our bedroom door, whining, and I'm like—God, not again, you know? [frustrated] But he wouldn't quit. Just kept pulling at my pajama sleeve, dragging me toward the kitchen. 

[shaky voice] The gas company said if we'd slept another hour, we all would've been... [pause] The stove valve was cracked, I guess from when they delivered it last week. Carbon monoxide was just filling up the whole first floor. [whispering] My kids were sleeping right above the kitchen.

And Bailey—this dog who, um, spent two years in that shelter, [crying while speaking] who nobody wanted because he was "too anxious"—he saved us. He literally saved my entire family. [sniffle] The firefighter said dogs can smell it way before we'd ever notice anything.

[warm] I keep thinking about all those families who passed him by at the shelter. "Too nervous," they said. "Too much work." Well, that nervous dog's anxiety is exactly what kept him alert enough to notice something was wrong. [very sincerely] I used to joke that we rescued him, but honestly? He rescued us. [relieved] We're getting those detectors installed tomorrow—every room. And Bailey? [chuckle] That dog's getting steak for the rest of his life.
