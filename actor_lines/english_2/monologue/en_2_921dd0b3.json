That's eight months of— [pause] I keep checking the numbers because maybe I'm reading this wrong? But no, it's all there in the spreadsheet, every single discrepancy ties back to Sarah's shifts.

That's twelve years.\n\n[hesitantly] I don't understand why she didn't just ask me for help. [frustrated] Like, if she needed money that badly, I would've— I would've figured something out!

From the business we built together? \n\n[angry] The worst part is she looked me in the eye yesterday and complained about our margins being down!
