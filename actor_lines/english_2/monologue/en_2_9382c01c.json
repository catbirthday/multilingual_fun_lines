[pause] The numbers for the premium inventory, they weren't matching up. [confused] At first I thought I'd miscounted, so I went back and counted again. And again. [slowly] Three times I counted those units. [gasp softly] And then I saw it. Someone had been entering the wholesale prices as retail in the system for, um... for months. [very excited] We've been undercharging on every single premium order since July! [laugh] Can you believe that? Every. Single. Order. [quickly] I ran the calculations and we're talking about— [whispering loudly] forty-seven thousand dollars. [long pause] Forty-seven thousand that just would've disappeared if I hadn't been so, uh, so obsessive about those numbers matching perfectly. [relieved] My manager almost cried when I showed her. [chuckle] She said most people would've just adjusted the count and moved on. [warmly] But that's not how I work, you know? [confidently] Those details matter. They always matter. [happy] And today, being that annoying person who triple-checks everything? [smiling speaking] Today it actually saved the day."
