[nervous] Like, really talking, not just those, you know, one-word answers I used to get. [pause] Emma asked me to braid her hair yesterday, and I just—[voice breaking] I mean, their mom just died two weeks ago, so obviously they're devastated, but it's like... [whispering] they're letting me in? [conflicted] Which is what I always wanted, right? But not like this—Jesus, definitely not like this. [frustrated] I spent three years being the evil stepmother, trying everything, and now suddenly I'm, what, the only mother figure they have left? [sad] Jake actually hugged me goodnight, and I just stood there thinking, oh my God, this is so fucked up. [guilty laugh] Because part of me was happy—[quickly] not about her dying, obviously, that's horrible—but like, finally feeling needed? [shaky voice] I keep wondering if she's watching somehow and just... hating me for, I don't know, benefiting from this nightmare. [crying] These poor kids, they're so lost, and here I am finally getting the relationship I wanted, built on literally the worst thing that could happen to them. [sniffles] It's so complicated, you know?"
