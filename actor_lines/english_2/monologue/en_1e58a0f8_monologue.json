[pause] And the kids, um, they miss school because they're sick from drinking it. [frustrated] We've been waiting for the government to help for what, fifteen years now? \n\n[excited] But I think I finally figured it out! Those biosand filters I've been researching, they're actually not that expensive to build. Like, we could literally make them ourselves with local materials. [speeding up] And if we set up a cooperative system where everyone contributes just a little bit each month—I did the math—we could have clean water stations throughout the village within six months. \n\n[hesitantly] I mean, I know what people are going to say. \"You're just a kid who went to college, what do you know about our problems?\" [very sincerely] But this is my home too. These are my neighbors, my family. [shaky voice] My little cousin got typhoid last year from the water and I just... I can't sit around anymore pretending it's not my responsibility.\n\n[confidently] So tomorrow I'm calling that meeting. Er, I've got the blueprints, the budget, everything. [warm] We're going to fix this ourselves. We have to."
