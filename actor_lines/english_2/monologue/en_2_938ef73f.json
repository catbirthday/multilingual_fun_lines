We only needed a hundred. [laugh] I was so nervous nobody would even show up, you know? [warm] But then the ballroom just kept filling and filling, and when Dr. Martinez started talking about the kids who need the new equipment... [sniffle] everyone just opened their hearts. [pause] And their wallets, apparently. [chuckle] The auction was insane—did you see the bidding war over the vacation package? [excited] Twenty-five thousand dollars for a week in Tuscany! [very quietly] I thought maybe we'd get five. [passionately] But this means we can get the MRI machine AND the play therapy room. [cry] Those babies are going to have— [trailing off] sorry, I just... [sigh] Six months of planning, all those sleepless nights wondering if anyone would care... [relieved] They cared. [smiling speaking] They really, really cared. My feet are killing me and I think I forgot to eat anything except, um, half a dinner roll, but honestly? [delighted] Best night of my life. [very sincerely] We're going to help so many kids."
