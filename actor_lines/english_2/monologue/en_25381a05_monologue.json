Behind my back? That's—Jesus, that's something else. [angry] How many dinners did we have together? How many times did he smile at me, [bitter] shake my hand, act like everything was fine? \n\nAnd you just... you knew about this? [very quietly] How long have you known? Actually, no—I don't even want to—[frustrated] God, this explains so much. The weird comments at Thanksgiving. The way your mom kept changing the subject when we talked about the house. [laugh] I'm such an idiot. \n\n[shaky voice] What did you say to him? When he was—when he was telling you to leave me? Did you defend us at all, or... [trailing off] I honestly don't know what hurts more—him doing it or you not telling me. [sigh] We're supposed to be a team, right? You and me against whatever comes? [very sad] But instead I'm finding out I've been fighting a battle I didn't even know existed. For months. \n\n[pause] So what happens now? Do we just pretend this conversation never happened? Show up for Sunday dinner like everything's normal?"
