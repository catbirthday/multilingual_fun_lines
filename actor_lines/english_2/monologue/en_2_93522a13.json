[bitter] Like, okay, great, you're sorry. But I've spent, what, two decades processing what you did to me? [frustrated] Every therapy session, every time I tell my story at those speaking engagements about resilience and... and overcoming adversity. [shaky voice] That's who I am now, you know? The person who survived you. [pause] And now you want to just, what, take that away from me with some Facebook message? [anxious] Because if I forgive you, if I say it's okay, then... then what does that make all of this? All this work I've done? [quietly] Maybe I'm being unfair but I'm actually—I'm kind of angry that you get to move on. [trailing off] That you get to feel better about yourself while I'm... [pause] God, I built my whole career on this, in a way. My book, my podcast about trauma and healing. [upset] And now you want closure? What about my closure? I already found it. Without you. I don't know if I can... if I even want to give you that satisfaction."
