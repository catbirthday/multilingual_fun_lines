=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] They want me to wear a badge now. Me. The same guy who used to... [pause] I spent fifteen years learning every angle, every tell, um, every weak spot people have when they're desperate. [regretful] And I was good at it. Really good. [clearing throat] The detective, she says I think like them because I was them, [slowly], which is why I can spot the romance scams before they drain some widow's savings. [sigh] Yesterday I stopped three different schemes targeting, you know, elderly folks in assisted living. [empathetically] These people remind me of my grandmother—God, she would've fallen for half the tricks I used to pull. [anxious] Sometimes I sit in these briefings and I'm teaching cops the exact cons I invented, [nervous laughter] and they're taking notes like I'm some kind of hero. [frustrated] I'm not a hero. I'm just... [trailing off] [long pause] But if knowing how to destroy trust means I can help rebuild it, [hopeful] maybe that's my penance. [very quietly] The victims' faces when we catch these guys, when we actually get their money back—[warm] that's something I never felt before. [confidently] Clean conscience. Who knew it would feel this good?
