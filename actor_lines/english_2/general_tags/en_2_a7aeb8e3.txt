Scenario: A corporate recruiter conducts a final interview with a charming candidate who is actually a corporate spy attempting to steal company secrets.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [warmly] So Marcus, your references were absolutely glowing, especially from DataTech Solutions where you apparently revolutionized their entire security infrastructure in just six months.

Character 2: Well, I believe in making an immediate impact wherever I land, and their systems were particularly, [chuckles], let's say accessible to improvement.

Character 1: [slightly puzzled] That's interesting phrasing—accessible—because when I called DataTech's HR department this morning, they had no record of you completing your exit paperwork.

Character 2: Oh, you know how these big corporations are with their bureaucracy, probably still sitting on someone's desk waiting for signatures. [dismissive laugh]

Character 1: Actually, they said you still have active credentials in their system, which seems odd for someone who left three months ago, wouldn't you agree?

Character 2: Sometimes IT departments are slow to revoke access, happens more often than you'd think in this industry. [shifts uncomfortably] Besides, I've been focused on preparing for this opportunity.

Character 1: [tensing] I see.

Character 2: Look, I know what you're thinking, but those credentials mean nothing to me now—I'm completely committed to starting fresh here with your innovative blockchain protocols.

Character 1: [carefully measured] It's funny you mention our blockchain protocols specifically, since we haven't publicly announced that project and it wasn't mentioned in the job posting.

Character 2: Must have heard about it.

Character 1: [voice hardening] From whom exactly? Because that information is under strict NDA, and only seven people in this company even know that project exists.

Character 2: People talk in this industry, you pick things up at conferences, networking events, [laughs nervously], you know how it is.

Character 1: Marcus, or whatever your real name is, I just received a text from our CTO saying you tried to access our internal servers during your bathroom break twenty minutes ago.

Character 2: [dropping the act entirely] Your guest WiFi security is pathetic, by the way—took me less than thirty seconds to find the vulnerability in your authentication protocols.

Character 1: [shakily] Security is already on their way up, and I'm recording this conversation now, so anything you say will be evidence for the authorities.

Character 2: Evidence of what exactly? That I noticed your laughably weak security during a legitimate interview? [coldly confident] Good luck proving intent in court.

Character 1: [desperately firm] You won't make it out of this building with any data you've stolen, our systems automatically flag and quarantine any unauthorized access attempts.

Character 2: Oh, I'm not leaving with your data—I already sent it to three different servers while we've been sitting here chatting about my fabricated references. [standing up slowly]

Character 1: Those transfers won't complete because we isolated the network the moment you tried to access it, so all you've done is expose yourself for nothing.

Character 2: You isolated the main network, sure, but your HVAC system runs on a separate subnet that nobody bothered to secure properly. [smiling coldly] Your entire financial database is probably in Beijing by now.
