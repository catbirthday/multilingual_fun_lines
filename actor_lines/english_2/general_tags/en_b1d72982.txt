Scenario: A document examiner discovers that the tax attorney who hired her to verify client records is actually her biological father who abandoned her family twenty years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [careful] These signatures, um, they're very, [measured], distinctive and I mean, the way the capital R curves in Richardson here, [trembling], it's exactly like something I've seen before, well, somewhere personal. [long pause]

Character 2: [nervous] You're being paid to verify, umm, authenticity for the audit, not to, [defensive], analyze handwriting patterns that, well, [tense], have nothing to do with the tax fraud case we're building, you know. [clears throat]

Character 1: [steady] Richardson wasn't your name twenty years ago when you, [voice breaking], signed my birthday cards with that same distinctive R before you, [hollow], disappeared from Mom's life and mine. [sighs]

Character 2: [stunned] Sarah, I didn't know they would, [shaking], assign you to this case, I specifically requested someone, [desperate], from outside the city.

Character 1: Well, um, here I am, the best document examiner in the state, [bitter], examining documents for the father who couldn't be bothered to, [cold], examine his own choices, you know.

Character 2: [broken] The firm doesn't know about my past, [pleading], about the family I left behind when everything fell, [crumbling], apart with the investigation.

Character 1: [whispered] Stop talking.

Character 2: [desperate] I know, um, I don't deserve to, [choked up], explain but the FBI was closing in on your grandfather's operation and staying would have, well, [anguished], destroyed you and your mother, I mean.

Character 1: [controlled] Twenty years of wondering if we weren't, [acidic], enough for you to stay and fight instead of, [trembling], running like a coward.

Character 2: You were everything.

Character 1: [raw] Mom died thinking you left because she got, [voice cracking], sick, that the medical bills scared you away, not some, [furious], noble sacrifice you're trying to sell me now. [exhales sharply]

Character 2: [anguished] Sarah, I mean, every case I've worked, um, every criminal I've helped prosecute has been, [breaking], trying to make up for leaving you both.

Character 1: [fierce] Well, you can't prosecute your way back into, um, [bitter], being my father after two decades of, I mean, [exhausted], silence and these documents I'm examining show exactly who you really are, you know.

Character 2: [quiet] Um, I sent money every month through, well, [ashamed], intermediaries to help with her treatments, I mean.

Character 1: [stunned] The anonymous donations that kept us, um, afloat during her chemo were, [realizing], from you? [long pause]

Character 2: [gentle] Every bonus, every, [tearful], raise went to making sure you could finish school and she could get the, [breaking], best care possible even if I couldn't be there to, [trailing off], hold her hand. [sobs quietly]

Character 1: [shattered] She kept every, [overwhelmed], receipt in a box labeled hope.

Character 2: [soft] I know, um, because I kept copies too, every, [tender], medical bill and tuition payment filed away like evidence that maybe I wasn't, well, [broken], completely lost to you both, you know.

Character 1: [exhausted] The audit files can wait because, um, right now I need to, [vulnerable], understand why a man who loved us enough to pay for everything couldn't, well, [searching], love us enough to stay. [sighs heavily]

Character 2: Because staying would have meant, well, watching the FBI arrest me in front of you, [haunted], and I couldn't let your last memory of your father be in handcuffs.
