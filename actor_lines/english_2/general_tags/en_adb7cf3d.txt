Scenario: A small engine repair tech is fixing the generator at a local radio station when the play-by-play announcer who once called their son's little league championship game walks in.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Um, uh, you're him. [stunned]

Character 2: [surprised] I'm sorry, I don't quite, [confused], understand what you mean but you look really, [searching], familiar somehow like we've met before. [pause]

Character 1: [emotional] You called my son's little league championship game seven years ago when, [voice breaking], nobody else would cover those kids.

Character 2: [remembering] Wait, the Wildcats versus the Thunder at, [excited], Riverside Park where that kid hit the walk-off triple in extra innings and the whole, [warm], team carried him around the field? [laughs softly]

Character 1: That was, um, my Tommy and, well, you made him feel like, [overwhelmed], a real ballplayer that day when you called his name with such, [trembling], enthusiasm like he was playing in the, [choked up], World Series or something.

Character 2: [quietly] Tommy Rodriguez. [long pause]

Character 1: [passionate] You know, um, he still has the recording of that broadcast and, uh, plays it whenever life gets, [intense], too hard because your voice reminds him of when anything, [hopeful], felt possible.

Character 2: Well, um, I had no idea anyone even, [humbled], listened to those games except the parents, and, uh, honestly calling those kids' games kept me, [vulnerable], sane during my divorce. [sighs deeply]

Character 1: [gentle] Those Saturday mornings at the field meant everything to families like ours who couldn't, [grateful], afford travel teams but still wanted our kids to feel, [tender], special and seen.

Character 2: The station wanted to cancel, [frustrated], that whole program but I fought to keep it going.

Character 1: [earnest] Tommy's in college now studying sports journalism because of you, because he wants to give, [proud], other kids what you gave him that day when everything, [nostalgic], mattered so much.

Character 2: [moved] That's incredible. [tears up]

Character 1: Um, listen, I mean, I'm just here fixing your generator but, [hesitant], seeing you brings back so much.

Character 2: [reflective] You know, um, people always ask why I still call high school games, well, after twenty years of, [sincere], major league broadcasts, but it's moments like this that, [emotional], remind me why. [voice cracks]

Character 1: [determined] Your generator's running perfect now and I'm not charging the station because some debts, [firm], can't be paid with money.

Character 2: [protesting] No, please, I can't let you, [uncomfortable], do that for free after all this work. [sighs]

Character 1: Well, um, you gave my son confidence that, uhh, changed his whole life trajectory, so I mean, [insistent], this is nothing.

Character 2: Would Tommy maybe want to shadow me during, [hopeful], a broadcast sometime because I could really use an assistant who understands why, [meaningful], these games matter?

Character 1: Um, are you, uh, serious? [overwhelmed]

Character 2: [smiling] Tell him the voice he remembers from that championship game wants to, [excited], teach him everything about making every kid feel like they're playing, [passionate], under the brightest lights imaginable.
