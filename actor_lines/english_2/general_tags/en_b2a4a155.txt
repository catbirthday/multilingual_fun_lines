Scenario: A packaging engineer discovers a handwritten suicide note sealed inside a factory product and brings it to a handwriting analyst who happens to be their estranged sister.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shaky voice] I, um, found something at the factory today that I, [swallowing hard], think you need to see—I mean, professionally, not because we're... anyway, it's important.

Character 2: After three years of not speaking, [stunned], you show up at my office with something from your packaging plant?

Character 1: [trembling] This note was sealed inside a product box dated two weeks ago, and the handwriting, [voice breaking], it mentions specific dates and locations that haven't happened yet. [long pause]

Character 2: [whispered] Oh my God.

Character 1: [desperate] Look, I know, um, we haven't talked since Mom's funeral, but you're the only handwriting expert I, [choking up], trust with something this serious, okay?

Character 2: [professional tone] Well, um, the pressure variations here, [examining closely], suggest extreme emotional distress, and these, [pointing], tremor patterns indicate someone who's, [voice dropping], genuinely planning something terrible, I mean, very soon.

Character 1: [urgent] So we need to, uh, find this person before—I mean, before they actually, [panicking], do what they're threatening to do, right?

Character 2: [focused] Based on, um, the letter formations and, [studying intently], spatial relationships, this person works at your facility—probably, [realizing], second shift based on the ink degradation patterns, you know?

Character 1: [horrified] That's, uh, that's my shift—I mean, I supervise those people every day and never, [voice cracking], noticed anyone who seemed, um, this desperate. [shuddering]

Character 2: [gently] Sarah, listen to me.

Character 1: [determined] We can use the packaging timestamps and security footage to narrow down who had access to that, [calculating], specific batch during the sealing process.

Character 2: [carefully] Um, there's something else—the way they form their lowercase 'g' and, [hesitant], the rightward slant combined with these, [concerned], pressure points suggests someone I've, [trailing off], analyzed before in a case. [deep breath]

Character 1: [firm] Then we need to cross-reference your previous case files with our, [thinking quickly], employee records immediately before someone gets hurt.

Character 2: The thing is, [reluctant], this handwriting shows signs of, [clinical], dissociation—the person might not even, [worried], fully remember writing this. [sighs heavily]

Character 1: [resolute] Well, I'm not losing another person I, um, care about because I didn't, [emotional], act fast enough—not again, you know?

Character 2: You couldn't have saved Mom. [pause]

Character 1: [breaking down] But I can save this person, and maybe, [hopeful], maybe working together on this, [voice softening], we can finally talk about what happened between us.

Character 2: [tearful] I've, um, missed having my sister in my life, and this, [gesturing], this horrible situation might be, well, the universe forcing us back together, I mean.

Character 1: [determined] So, um, we check the employee files first, then, [planning], review security footage from that shift, and, [fierce], we don't stop until we find them, uh, together. [firmly]

Character 2: [committed] Together—and, um, after we save this person, maybe we can, [vulnerable], finally have that coffee we've been, well, avoiding for three years?
