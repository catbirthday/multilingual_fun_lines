=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Don't call anyone, please, I just need a minute to catch my breath here on the ground. [strained]

Character 2: Already calling 911.

Character 1: [firmly] Cancel it. I'm Marcus Chen, I run Apex Industries, and the last thing I need is headlines about me collapsing on Fifth Avenue during market hours.

Character 2: [calmly] Your left arm is shaking and you're sweating through a suit that probably costs more than my car, so I'm keeping them on the line.

Character 1: [controlled breathing] It's just exhaustion, fourteen-hour days for three weeks straight closing the Singapore merger. My driver is two blocks away, I can make it.

Character 2: Sure, exhaustion.

Character 1: You don't understand what happens when the market sees weakness—stock prices, board confidence, everything I've built for twenty years can crumble from one photograph. [gasps]

Character 2: [steadily] I'm a cardiac nurse heading home from a double shift, so actually I understand exactly what's happening to your body right now, Mr. Chen.

Character 1: [quieter] A nurse. Of course. Look, I know what this looks like, but I've handled worse than a little chest tightness.

Character 2: [matter-of-fact] The ambulance is three minutes out, and you're going to sit here with me, breathing slowly, not arguing, while I monitor your pulse.

Character 1: My father died of a heart attack at fifty-eight, same age I am now, same goddamn street corner actually. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [gently] That's quite a coincidence, but you're not going to die today, not on my watch, not on this corner.

Character 1: He was closing a deal too, rushed out of a meeting, never made it to the hospital. I swore I'd be different.

Character 2: [firmly] You are different—you're accepting help, even if reluctantly, and that ambulance is pulling up right now.

Character 1: What's your name? I should at least know who's saving me from my own stupidity. [exhales slowly]

Character 2: Diana Morrison, and you're not stupid, just human like the rest of us. [reassuring]

Character 1: [weakly] Diana, when this gets out, and it will, my competitors are going to circle like sharks. Twenty years of being untouchable, gone.

Character 2: [clearly] Twenty years from now, you'll either be telling this story at dinner parties or your kids will be telling it at your funeral—your choice.

Character 1: [surrendering] Alright, Diana Morrison, cardiac nurse with terrible bedside manner, help me up. Let's go to the hospital. [sighs]

Character 2: Best decision you've made all day, Mr. Chen, maybe all year.
