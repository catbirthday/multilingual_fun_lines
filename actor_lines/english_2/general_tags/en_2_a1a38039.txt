Scenario: A night school student arrives home at 2 AM to find their spouse, the family's sole breadwinner, waiting in the dark kitchen with an eviction notice.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [stunned] Why are you sitting in the dark with— is that an eviction notice? I thought we had another month before things got this bad.

Character 2: They accelerated the timeline when we missed last month's payment, and I've been carrying this around for three days trying to figure out how to tell you. [exhales heavily]

Character 1: Three days? You've known for three days and didn't say anything while I was studying for finals that might not even matter now?

Character 2: [defensive] Because you need to finish your degree, that's the whole point of me working these double shifts while you're at school until midnight every night.

Character 1: [voice cracking] The whole point doesn't matter if we're homeless next month. I can drop out, get a full-time job tomorrow, we can fix this together.

Character 2: No, absolutely not. We've sacrificed too much for you to quit now when you're only two semesters away from graduating. [firmly]

Character 1: Stop protecting me from reality! I'm not a child who needs you to shield me from our financial problems while you drown alone.

Character 2: [quietly intense] You think I'm drowning? I'm managing fourteen-hour days at the warehouse specifically so you don't have to make these impossible choices right now.

Character 1: Managing? We're getting evicted! [bitter laugh] How is that managing anything?

Character 2: Because I have a plan, okay? My sister said we can stay in her basement for three months if we need to, just until you graduate.

Character 1: [incredulous] Your sister who lives forty miles from my school? How exactly am I supposed to get to night classes from there without a car?

Character 2: I'll drive you. I'll rearrange my shifts, work mornings instead so I can take you to campus every evening and pick you up.

Character 1: [softer] That's insane. You'd be driving eighty miles a day on top of working full-time, you'd destroy yourself trying to make that work.

Character 2: [steadily] It's eight months until you graduate. Eight months of hell versus a lifetime of you resenting me for letting you quit when we were this close.

Character 1: I would never resent you for that. [sighs] But I am starting to resent you making these decisions alone like my opinion doesn't matter.

Character 2: [hurt] Your opinion matters more than anything, but someone has to be practical here while you're focused on your studies and building our future.

Character 1: Our future doesn't exist if we can't survive the present. Let me take a semester off, work, then go back when we're stable. [pleading]

Character 2: [exhausted] You know what happens to people who take 'just one semester' off. They never go back. Life gets in the way, bills pile up, and suddenly it's been five years.

Character 1: [resigned whisper] So what do we do? Accept your sister's offer and pretend everything's fine while we live in her basement like we're twenty again?

Character 2: [gently firm] We survive. We do whatever it takes for eight more months, then when you have that degree, everything changes. That's what we do.
