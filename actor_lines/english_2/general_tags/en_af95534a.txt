Scenario: An estranged older sibling shows up unannounced at their younger sister's valedictorian speech rehearsal, having been absent from her life for six years due to addiction.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I know I have no right to be here after, [voice breaking], six years of silence but I had to see you practice your, [trembling], valedictorian speech before tomorrow's graduation. [long pause]

Character 2: [stunned] You actually came.

Character 1: [desperate] Please don't leave.

Character 2: Um, I spent every birthday, every Christmas, well, every achievement wondering if you'd, [bitter], show up and now you're here the night before I, [trailing off], graduate and I just... I mean, why now?

Character 1: [quiet] Because I finally got clean and realized how much of your life I'd, [ashamed], missed while chasing something that was slowly killing me.

Character 2: [conflicted] You missed me getting into Yale, you missed my first heartbreak, you missed the night I, [voice cracking], needed my big brother when Dad had his heart attack and Mom was, [shaking], falling apart.

Character 1: [broken] I know I failed you when you needed me most and watching you become this incredible person from, [choking up], a distance through Mom's Facebook posts has been my own personal, [heavy], hell.

Character 2: [softening] She told me you've been sober for eight months now and that you're, [careful], working at the community center helping kids who remind you of, [wistful], who we used to be. [sighs deeply]

Character 1: [hopeful] Every single one of them reminds me of how brilliant you were even at ten years old, [proud], always helping me with my homework even though you were five grades behind.

Character 2: Well, um, I actually wrote about you in my speech, I mean, not by name but about how, [vulnerable], sometimes the people who teach us the most are the ones who show us what paths, err, not to take.

Character 1: [hurt] That's fair and I deserve to be a cautionary tale in your, [accepting], story of success.

Character 2: No, um, that's not... well, I wrote about how you taught me calculus using pizza slices and, er, how you stayed up all night helping me build that solar system model and, umm, how losing you taught me that love isn't always enough to save someone.

Character 1: [tearful] I'm so sorry.

Character 2: [determined] I need you to know that I'm going to Yale to study addiction medicine because, well, I mean, I couldn't save you but maybe I can, [fierce], save someone else's brother. [voice breaking]

Character 1: [overwhelmed] You're going to be an incredible doctor and I promise I'll stay clean long enough to, [resolute], see you graduate from medical school this time.

Character 2: [testing] Well, umm, Mom saved you a ticket for tomorrow's ceremony even though I told her not to, er, bother because you never show up but maybe, [hopeful], maybe this time you'll actually use it and, um, prove me wrong. [long pause]

Character 1: [firm] I'll be in the third row wearing Dad's old tie, the ugly green one you always, [smiling through tears], made fun of, and I'll be the proudest big brother in that entire auditorium even though, well, I know I haven't earned that right. [voice cracking]

Character 2: [emotional] The speech starts with a quote about second chances and how sometimes the bravest thing we can do is, [steady], show up after we've failed, and I guess I wrote it hoping somehow you'd, [breaking], hear it.

Character 1: [grateful] Well, um, I'm here now and I'm listening and, err, if you'll let me, I'd like to keep showing up.

Character 2: [accepting] Just promise me you'll stay alive long enough for me to, [determined], get my degree and help you properly because I can't lose you, [fierce], twice.
