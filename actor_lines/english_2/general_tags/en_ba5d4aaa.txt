Scenario: A property middleman discovers his estranged brother has been squatting in a building he's been hired to clear for demolition.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [stunned] Marcus, what the hell are you, [disbelief], doing here when the company sent me to, [cold], clear this building for demolition next week?

Character 2: [defensive] Well, um, living.

Character 1: [bitter] You've been missing for two years and now I find you, [angry], squatting in this condemned hellhole like some kind of, [disgusted], vagrant when mom's been worried sick about you every, [voice breaking], single day.

Character 2: [simmering] Mom stopped worrying about me the day she, [accusatory], chose your father over her own son and let him throw me out for, [hollow], being exactly who I am.

Character 1: [harsh] That's not true.

Character 2: I've been living here for, um, eight months now and, [tired], you know what's funny is that I actually made this place feel more like, [bitter], home than that house ever was with all its, well, perfect family portraits that I was never really part of. [laughs darkly]

Character 1: [calculated] Look, I have a job to do here and this building, [detached], comes down in five days whether you're in it or not. [pause]

Character 2: Well, um, I mean, typical. [sighs]

Character 1: [icy] Don't make this harder than it needs to be because I'm already, [struggling], risking my reputation by not calling the cops right now and having you, [stern], dragged out of here tonight. [exhales]

Character 2: [defiant] You always were the company man weren't you, [mocking], following orders and checking boxes while people's actual lives fell apart around you, [venomous], never once stopping to ask why your own brother disappeared into the, [breaking], streets.

Character 1: [wavering] Marcus, I mean, I tried to find you after you left but you just, um, vanished without a trace.

Character 2: [raw] That's because I didn't want to be found by people who only, [hurt], saw me as a problem to solve.

Character 1: [desperate] So what, you're just going to, um, live in abandoned buildings forever while I, [guilty], pretend I never saw you here and let them, [cracking], tear this place down around your stubborn pride, I mean, is that the plan? [voice breaks]

Character 2: Pride is thinking you can just, [seething], waltz in here after two years and suddenly care about what happens to me when you're only here because someone's, well, paying you to be, [spitting], not because you actually give a damn about family, um, or whatever we used to be. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: [quiet] Well, I still have mom's spare key in my pocket if you want it, um, though I doubt you'd ever use it.

Character 2: [shocked] You've been carrying that key for two years while I've been, [choked], sleeping on concrete floors and stealing food from dumpsters, [overwhelmed], wondering if anyone even remembered I existed. [long pause]

Character 1: [broken] Every single day I've carried it hoping I'd, um, find you somewhere and, [trembling], somehow convince you to come home even though I knew you'd probably, [defeated], hate me for not standing up to him when it mattered, well, when you needed me most.

Character 2: [softening] The demolition crew doesn't have to know about the squatter in unit 4B if the, [careful], middleman's report says the building was already cleared. [pause]

Character 1: [resolute] The building was empty when I inspected it and there's a furnished apartment available if someone, [hopeful], needed a place to stay. [exhales slowly]

Character 2: [tearful] Maybe I could try using that key just once to see if it, [vulnerable], still works. [sniffles]
