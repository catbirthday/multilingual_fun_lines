Scenario: A prop designer visits their brother, a meat cutter, to discuss selling their late mother's house, which holds decades of theatrical props she collected.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [heavy] Well, I mean, I've been going through Mom's house and there's just, [overwhelmed], so many props and costumes she collected over forty years that I, um, [breaking], can't figure out what to do with them all.

Character 2: [quiet] I told you we should just, [firm], call an estate sale company and let them handle everything professionally. [sighs]

Character 1: But you know, these aren't just things, they're like, [choked up], pieces of her soul from every show she ever designed, um, every character she brought to life.

Character 2: [frustrated] Look, I spend my days, [measured], cutting meat into precise portions and I've learned that sentiment, [cold], doesn't pay bills and we need to, [practical], sell that house before the market turns.

Character 1: [pleading] I mean, can't we at least, um, keep some of the special pieces like the, [wistful], Victorian parasol from her first professional show or the, [tender], masks she made when we were kids? [pauses]

Character 2: [resigned] Well, you know, I've been working double shifts at the shop trying to, [exhausted], cover her medical bills while you were, um, [bitter], off designing sets for theaters that barely, [sharp], pay you enough to live.

Character 1: That's not fair because I, [defensive], flew home every weekend during her chemo and spent, [cracking], everything I had on experimental treatments.

Character 2: [softer] I know, um, I'm sorry, it's just that seeing all her stuff makes me, [struggling], realize how much of her life I missed while I was, well, [regretful], working in that cold room all day.

Character 1: [gentle] She understood why you had to work so much and she was, [sincere], incredibly proud of how you provided for your family. [sighs]

Character 2: Um, I guess so.

Character 1: [thoughtful] You know, I mean, maybe we could donate some pieces to the community theater where she, [nostalgic], started her career, um, and keep just a few things that really matter.

Character 2: [considering] The theater would probably appreciate that and it's, [warming], what she would have wanted instead of everything ending up in some stranger's garage.

Character 1: [hopeful] Um, we could even create a small memorial display with her, well, [emotional], favorite pieces and maybe her tools, you know, [voice breaking], the ones she taught us both to use.

Character 2: [surprised] You still remember how to use those old, [thoughtful], leather working tools she loved so much?

Character 1: Every stitch and cut she taught me is, [proud], burned into my muscle memory and I use, [emotional], those same techniques in my work today. [voice cracks]

Character 2: Well, I mean, I use her knife sharpening technique at the shop every day and, um, [vulnerable], sometimes I can almost hear her voice correcting my angle.

Character 1: [teary] You know, maybe if we work through the house together, um, sharing the stories behind each piece, it might, [healing], help us both process this grief instead of just, well, [trembling], rushing to empty it out. [sniffles]

Character 2: [accepting] All right, I can take some time off next week and we'll, [determined], sort through everything properly together.

Character 1: [grateful] That means everything to me and I think Mom would be, [peaceful], happy knowing we're doing this together.

Character 2: [sincere] Yeah, well, um, she always said her greatest productions were, [tender], the two of us, even if we turned out, I mean, [bittersweet], completely different than she expected, you know, [soft laugh], a meat cutter and a prop designer.
