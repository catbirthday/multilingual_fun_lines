Scenario: A guitar tech discovers their late father's best friend, an insulation worker, has been secretly maintaining their father's vintage guitar collection in a climate-controlled storage unit for years after the funeral.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [stunned] These are his guitars.

Character 2: [gentle] Your dad asked me to keep them, [careful], safe after his diagnosis came through. [exhales]

Character 1: [trembling] But I thought, um, he sold everything to pay for the, [breaking], treatments and I mean, [choking up], we had that fight about him giving up on, well, [bitter], music completely.

Character 2: He never sold them, [protective], just needed you to think he did.

Character 1: You've been paying for, um, [incredulous], climate-controlled storage for three years since he, well, [shaking], died and maintaining the humidity levels and, er, [overwhelmed], temperature controls that vintage Gibsons need?

Character 2: The insulation work I do, well, [knowledgeable], taught me about moisture barriers and um, [proud], thermal regulation so I knew how to keep them, you know, perfect.

Character 1: [anguished] Why didn't you, um, tell me at the funeral when I was, well, [angry], crying about how he gave up everything he loved?

Character 2: He made me promise to wait until, um, [steady], you stopped being angry at him because, well, [emotional], he wanted you to remember the music, you know, [voice cracking], not the fight.

Character 1: [desperate] I'm a guitar tech and I could have, um, [frustrated], been maintaining his collection all this time instead of, well, wondering why he stopped playing.

Character 2: Every month I restring them, [methodical], check the neck tension and, [reverent], polish them just like he showed me back when we were, [nostalgic], young and stupid.

Character 1: This 1959 Les Paul was, [amazed], the one he played at my high school graduation when he, [tearful], surprised me on stage even though he was already, [whispering], sick.

Character 2: [soft] He recorded something for you on it, um, about two weeks before he, well, [struggling], couldn't hold it anymore.

Character 1: [shocked] There's a recording of him, [desperate], playing when he could barely stand and nobody, [accusatory], thought to tell me?

Character 2: The cassette tape is in the case with, [careful], his handwriting on it saying, [tender], 'For when you're ready to hear me again' and, [knowing], today felt like the right time.

Character 1: [breaking] All these years I thought he, um, [regretful], gave up on music but he was actually, well, [realizing], protecting it for me even when I was too angry to, you know, [ashamed], understand.

Character 2: [comforting] Your dad knew guitars needed, [wise], the right environment to survive just like, [meaningful], forgiveness needs time.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] You kept them at exactly, um, [grateful], forty-five percent humidity and seventy degrees just like he, well, [crying], always insisted on even when mom said he was, you know, [laughing through tears], being obsessive.

Character 2: [warm] Some things are worth, [sincere], being obsessive about.

Character 1: [determined] Can you show me how you've been, um, [eager], maintaining them because I want to, well, [hopeful], do it right from now on and maybe, you know, [vulnerable], you could tell me the stories he never did?

Character 2: [emotional] I've got twenty years of stories and, um, [smiling], a whole notebook where he wrote down which guitar he wanted, well, [thoughtful], you to have for every milestone like your wedding and, you know, [voice breaking], your first kid.
