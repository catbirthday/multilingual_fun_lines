Scenario: vineyard worker, confused about benefits coverage gaps during the off-season

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, yeah, so I just got this, uh, letter saying my coverage ends next month? That can't be right.

Customer Support: Okay so let me, um, pull up your account here. Can I get your member ID? It should start with VBN and then, uh, six digits after that.

Customer: It's, er—wait, let me—VBN, um, 482... no, sorry, 428756.

Customer Support: Got it. So I'm seeing here that, um, you're listed under our seasonal agriculture program, member VBN-428756, and [exhales] basically what happens is coverage runs March through October during active harvest periods.

Customer: Oh great. Perfect. So I just, what, um, don't get sick in winter?

Customer Support: I understand the frustration. So there are, um, bridge options available. Your case number for this call is CSE-9847-ML and, uh, basically we have three different gap coverage plans starting at—

Customer: Um, hang on, I'm not—I mean, nobody told me this when I signed up, er, back in spring.

Customer Support: Right right. So looking at your enrollment date of, um, March fifteenth under application APP-3924-KV, I can see the seasonal terms were, uh, included in section four but [sharp inhale] I get that it's not always clear.

Customer: Section four. Sure. 'Cause everyone reads, um, all forty pages of that thing.

Customer Support: [Exhales] Totally fair point. So basically what I can do right now is, um, get you enrolled in our winter bridge plan WBP-2024 which would, uh, start December first and run through February twenty-eighth.

Customer: Uh, okay but—wait, what's that cost? I'm not exactly, er, rolling in cash here.

Customer Support: So the monthly premium for plan code WBP-STD-2024 is, um, one-forty-nine, but [breath] since you've been continuously covered since March, you'd qualify for the, uh, loyalty discount bringing it to ninety-seven fifty.

Customer: Ninety-seven fifty. Um. That's still—I mean, er, sorry, I'm just trying to figure out how to swing that.

Customer Support: No no, I get it. So let me, um, check something else here. Your employment code is listed as VIN-AG-SEASONAL and, uh, actually there might be a subsidy program you qualify for.

Customer: Wait, there's a—no wait, actually—um, why wasn't I told about this before?

Customer Support: [Sharp inhale] So looking at your account notes under reference REF-8823-QP, it looks like, um, the subsidy program just launched in September, so basically it wasn't available when you first enrolled.

Customer: Um, okay, sorry, I'm being—er, you're being helpful. I'm just frustrated.

Customer Support: Absolutely understood. So here's what I'm gonna do—I'm submitting subsidy application SUB-4429-RT right now, and, um, based on your income bracket code IB-3, you should qualify for the sixty percent reduction.

Customer: Sixty percent? So that's, uh, what—forty bucks? Er, thirty-something?

Customer Support: Thirty-nine dollars exactly. And [exhales] you know what? I'm also adding priority flag PF-URGENT to application SUB-4429-RT so, um, instead of the normal five days, you'll hear back within twenty-four hours.
