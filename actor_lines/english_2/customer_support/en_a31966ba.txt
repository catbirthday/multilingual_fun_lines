Scenario: complaining about poor customer service on a previous call

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um okay so I just—I just need to talk about yesterday's call because, uh, it was—it was absolutely ridiculous, like, um, forty-five minutes on hold?

Customer Support: Let me see here... so basically I'm pulling up your account and, hmm, I can see the call log from yesterday under reference number REF-9847-JL22, and it shows... okay so that's concerning.

Customer: Wait wait wait, you can—you can see it? Because the guy, um, he literally hung up on me, like, uh, mid-sentence!

Customer Support: So, um, according to the notes here on ticket TKT-482916, there was, uh, what looks like... hmm, so basically a disconnection at 3:47 PM, and I'm, um, really sorry about that happening.

Customer: Sorry? I had to—no wait—I called back three times!

Customer Support: Okay so, um, I'm seeing those attempts here, like, at 4:12, 4:38, and, uh, 5:15 PM under tracking codes TRK-8821, TRK-8834, and, um, TRK-8847, and hmm, none of them connected properly.

Customer: Um exactly! And and and nobody, like, nobody even tried to call me back, uh, even though I left my number twice!

Customer Support: Right, I understand your frustration. Let me check... so the callback request forms CBR-7739-A and CBR-7740-A are here but they weren't... hmm, what if we make sure this gets handled today?

Customer: Um today? Like, uh, you know my bill is due tomorrow and, um, that's what I was calling about yesterday!

Customer Support: So basically, um, here's what I can do—I'm, uh, putting an extension on your account right now, reference EXT-9982-KL, and, um, that gives us time to, like, properly resolve everything.

Customer: Okay okay but—but what about the late fee?

Customer Support: Hmm, so, um, given the service issues yesterday, I'm, uh, I'm going ahead and, like, waiving that fee—adjustment code ADJ-6623-RT—and so basically that's, um, already applied to your account.

Customer: Wait really? Because, um, yesterday's guy said—he said there was, uh, absolutely nothing he could do.

Customer Support: Let me see here... okay so your previous representative had, hmm, limited access, but with escalation ticket ESC-7729-MP, I have authorization to make these adjustments. So basically we're getting this fixed.

Customer: I just—I just don't understand why, um, why it took all this, like, my wedding venue deposit is—uh, never mind, that's not your problem.

Customer Support: Actually, um, wait—so if this is time-sensitive, I can, uh, hmm, let me put a priority flag PRI-8847-HIGH on your account so, like, any future issues get, um, immediate escalation.

Customer: You'd—you'd do that? That's actually helpful!

Customer Support: So basically, um, I'm also adding my direct extension—it's, uh, 4782—to your file under contact code CON-9923-DIR, and like, if anything comes up, you can, um, skip the queue entirely.

Customer: Um wow, okay, this is—this is so different from yesterday, like, uh, thank you, seriously, I was about to, um, switch companies.

Customer Support: Hmm, well, I'm glad we could, um, turn this around, and so your confirmation for everything we discussed today is, uh, CONF-7739-RESOLVED, and basically, like, I genuinely apologize for yesterday's experience.
