Scenario: disputing an unexpected charge on their credit card statement

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, I'm so sorry to bother you but, uh, I have this—wait, sorry—this charge on my statement?

Customer Support: Oh! No bother at all, I mean, that's literally what I'm here for, so let me just, um, pull up your account real quick here and we'll totally crack this case, what's the last four of your card?

Customer: It's, um... 4782. Sorry, I mean—wait, that's the wrong—no, that's right. 4782.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect, got it, so I'm seeing account ending in 4782 and, hmm, I can already spot maybe three or four charges from yesterday, but um, which one's got you puzzled? I love these mysteries, seriously, it's probably something with a weird merchant name, happens all the time.

Customer: The one that's—sorry, let me find it—it's for $87.42?

Customer Support: Ooh okay okay, um, so that's interesting because I'm seeing, uh, transaction ID TXN-885421-QV and it's showing as, hmm, what's the word I'm looking for... a subscription renewal? But wait wait wait, let me dig deeper 'cause I think there's more to this story here.

Customer: I don't—I mean, um, I probably did something wrong when I canceled it?

Customer Support: No no no! Oh my gosh, um, you did nothing wrong at all, so what I'm seeing here is, uh, kind of fascinating actually—your cancellation request CC-7749-RT went through on the 15th but then, hmm, their system still processed the charge anyway which is totally on them, not you.

Customer: Oh. Um, I knew this wasn't your fault, I just, uh... sorry for the trouble.

Customer Support: Got it sorted!

Customer: Wait, already? But I thought—sorry, um, how did you...?

Customer Support: So okay, um, here's what I did, and uh, this is kinda cool actually—I've initiated dispute case DSP-9982-MK44 and I'm gonna, hmm, make sure this never happens again by adding a block code, sort of like a shield, on that merchant.

Customer: Um, that's really, uh... I mean, thank you? I feel so stupid not noticing earlier.

Customer Support: Oh no no no, don't even, um, so here's the thing—these companies, they kinda bank on people not noticing, right? But you caught it and that's what matters, plus I'm putting a note, uh, NFT-4419-B, that'll flag any similar charges for the next six months just to be super safe.

Customer: You're being so—I mean, um, I really appreciate that you're not making me feel dumb about this.

Customer Support: Absolutely not!

Customer: So, uh, when will I see the—sorry, the refund? Is that the right word?

Customer Support: Yeah yeah, refund's right, so um, with dispute case DSP-9982-MK44, you'll probably see a temporary credit in like, hmm, 24 to 48 hours? But the permanent fix takes maybe 5-7 business days, and uh, I'm gonna personally monitor this one, make sure it goes through smooth.

Customer: Um, wow, that's... I mean, uh, thank you so much for taking care of all this.

Customer Support: Oh that's what I'm here for, and um, honestly? I love when I can just, you know, completely fix something like this, so I've added protection code PRT-6633-XX to your whole account which basically means, uh, any weird charges get flagged to me personally, and hmm, you won't have to worry about this stuff anymore, promise.
