Scenario: landscaper, frustrated about equipment rental charges for dates he didn't have the equipment

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look, I'm sorry to bother you with this but there's been some mistake with my rental charges.

Customer Support: Oh, um, no problem at all! I'm, uh, I'm happy to help you figure this out. So let me just, um, pull up your account here. Can you, uh, give me your rental agreement number? It should be, um, probably starts with RNT or something like that.

Customer: So basically it's RNT-4428-JL and like... I returned the aerator on the 15th but you're charging me through the 22nd.

Customer Support: Okay okay, so, um, I've got RNT-4428-JL right here and, uh, let me just... hmm. I can see the aerator rental. Started on the 8th. Now, um, I think what I'm seeing here is, uh, the return was processed but maybe, maybe not completed? Let me check the return log.

Customer: I mean, um, I dropped it off myself so, uh, I know it was back on the 15th.

Customer Support: Right right, I totally understand. So here's what I'm, um, I'm teaching myself as I go here too—our system shows, uh, a pending return status. Code PND-7763-X. That means someone, someone checked it in but didn't, um, didn't finalize it. Probably just a quick fix.

Customer: God, I'm such an idiot, I probably didn't sign something or...

Customer Support: Oh no no! Not at all. This happens. Like, um, probably ten times a day, honestly. Let me just, uh, let me walk through this with you. First thing—do you, um, do you happen to have your return receipt? Should be number RCP-15503-M or something close to that.

Customer: Yeah so I've got it right here, RCP-15503-M, exactly.

Customer Support: Perfect! Okay so, um, that's that's really good actually. With that receipt, uh, I can just... hmm, let me override this. Transaction TXN-883296547 is showing, um, showing the physical return. Just wasn't linked. Give me one sec here.

Customer: I know this isn't your fault, the system just... anyway, I really appreciate you helping.

Customer Support: You're so kind to say that. Really. Okay so, um, so what I'm doing now is, uh, I'm crediting back those seven days. That's, um, that's $420 going back to your card ending in 8826. Should post in, uh, probably 2-3 business days.

Customer: Um, that's perfect, thank you so, so much, I mean I feel bad even calling about this.

Customer Support: Please don't! This is, this is what I'm here for. Teaching moment actually—um, when you return equipment? Always, uh, always ask for the green copy. Not yellow. Green shows it's it's fully processed. Reference number for this credit is CRD-9984-TK22.

Customer: Green copy, got it. And honestly you've been so patient with me being all flustered...

Customer Support: Oh my gosh, no. You were, um, you were totally calm actually. Trust me, I've I've had much worse today! So, uh, is there anything else with the rental account I can, um, I can help you with?

Customer: Actually yeah, um, real quick—can I reserve the power rake for next month or...?

Customer Support: Absolutely! Let me, um, let me check availability for you. What dates were you, uh, were you thinking? I can set up reservation RES-3847-PQ right now and, um, and lock in our contractor rate for you.

Customer: So like the 12th through the 14th if that works.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect. Um, I've got you down for pickup on the 12th. Return by, uh, by 5pm on the 14th. Confirmation is CNF-7453-BX91. And, um, and this time? Ask for that green copy! Should be should be all set now though.
