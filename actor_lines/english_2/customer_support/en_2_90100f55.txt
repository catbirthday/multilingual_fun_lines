=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I need to talk about my bill—wait, is this billing? Or should I call somewhere else? I can't pay the full amount right now.

Customer Support: Yes, you're in the right place. I can help. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your account number? Or the phone number on the account works too.

Customer: It's 555—no sorry, that's my old number—it's 555-0142. But listen, the bill is due tomorrow and I just can't—

Customer Support: Got it. Account ACC-4729-BK. I see the balance. It's $487.23 due tomorrow. Let's work through this together. We have several payment options available.

Customer: Four hundred? Wait, I thought it was three something? How is it that much? I can maybe do half but not—sorry, I'm just really stressed about this.

Customer Support: I understand completely. The total includes. Your monthly service at $289. Plus the device payment of $45. And there's a late fee from last month. But here's what we can do.

Customer: Late fee? I paid last month! Didn't I? Oh god, maybe I forgot, everything's been so crazy with my hours getting cut.

Customer Support: Actually, let me check. Payment received on the 23rd. But it was partial. Only $150 of the $310 due. That triggered the $35 late fee. But listen. We can definitely set up a payment arrangement.

Customer: Can you really? Because I keep reading online that they shut off service immediately and I need my phone for work interviews.

Customer Support: Absolutely we can help. Your account qualifies for our FlexPay program. Reference number FPX-9021-AA. Split the balance over three months. No service interruption. Small $5 setup fee but that's it.

Customer: Three months? That's like... um... hundred and sixty each month? Plus my regular bill? I don't know if I can swing that.

Customer Support: Right right. Let me recalculate. So if we do FlexPay. Your $487.23 splits to $162.41 monthly. Plus your regular $334 service. That's about $496 total each month. But wait. I have another option.

Customer: Five hundred a month? That's more than—sorry, what's the other option? I really need something that works.

Customer Support: Okay okay. Here's what I can do. Extended payment plan EPP-7764-MX. Spreads the balance over six months. That's just $81.20 added to your regular bill. Much more manageable.

Customer: Eighty dollars... so that would make it four hundred total? Wait, but what happens if I miss one? Do I lose everything?

Customer Support: Your monthly would be $415.20 total. Very doable. And here's the thing. If you miss a payment. You get a seven-day grace period. Text reminder on day three. Email on day five. We really work with you.

Customer: Okay, that's—I mean, that could work. Are you sure about the grace period? And this won't affect my credit?

Customer Support: Hundred percent sure. Policy document PD-2847 explicitly states. Seven-day grace period for all extended payment plans. And no. This is an internal arrangement. Not reported to credit bureaus. Unless it defaults after 90 days. Which won't happen.

Customer: Can we do the six-month one then? I just... I really appreciate this, I've been losing sleep over this whole thing.

Customer Support: Setting it up right now. Extended plan active. Confirmation number EC-9923-PPL. First payment of $415.20 due in 30 days on the 15th. You're all set. And honestly? You're going to be fine. This is what we're here for.
