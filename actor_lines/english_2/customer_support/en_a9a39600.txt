Scenario: trying to return an item past the return window

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Oh hey! So I've got—wait, let me just—I've got this coffee maker I need to return.

Customer Support: Um, okay, absolutely, I can, uh, definitely help you with that return today, um, let me just pull up our system here and, er, we'll get this sorted out for you right away, don't worry.

Customer: Great, you guys are always so helpful! I bought—no actually ordered it—ordered it online.

Customer: Um, that's perfect, so, uh, if you have your order number that would be, um, really helpful, but if not I can, er, look it up by your email or, uh, phone number, whatever works best.

Customer: Sure, it's um, let me find—oh wait here—order number JKR-4492-NM88.

Customer Support: Okay so, um, I've got order JKR-4492-NM88 here and, uh, I can see the coffee maker was delivered, er, let me just check the date here, um, looks like November 3rd, is that right?

Customer: Yeah that sounds about right! Been meaning to return it but you know how life gets.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely, um, I totally understand, so, er, the thing is—and I'm, uh, really sorry about this—our return window is, um, thirty days, and we're at, er, let me see, forty-seven days now.

Customer: Wait really? I thought—no that can't—oh man, I'm such an idiot, sorry!

Customer Support: No no no, um, please don't apologize, this happens, uh, all the time actually, and, er, let me just, um, see what options we might have here because, uh, I want to help if I can.

Customer: Um, yeah I just, uh, kept putting it off and, er, now I feel terrible bothering you with this.

Customer Support: Um, you know what, that's actually, er, kind of interesting because I'm seeing here in your account RCP-4492-U that, um, you've been a customer for, uh, wow, eight years, never had a return issue before.

Customer: Ha! Yeah I'm basically—wait no actually—I order everything from you guys!

Customer Support: So, um, here's what I'm thinking, and, er, this is a little unusual but, uh, given your history with us, um, let me check with my supervisor real quick about maybe doing a one-time exception?

Customer: Oh that would be—I mean if you can't—totally understand if that's not possible!

Customer Support: Um, okay so, er, good news, my supervisor just approved a, uh, special return authorization code SRA-8827-XK for you, um, even though we're past the window, so we can, er, definitely process this return.

Customer: Are you serious? Oh my god, you're literally the best! This is why I love you guys!

Customer Support: Aw, um, that's so nice to hear, really, so, uh, I'm sending you a return label now to your email, and, er, just use authorization code SRA-8827-XK when you ship it back.

Customer: Perfect! Hey sorry again for being—you know—such a procrastinator about this!

Customer Support: Um, honestly don't even, uh, worry about it, like I said this happens, er, all the time, and, um, that's what we're here for, to help however we can, okay?
