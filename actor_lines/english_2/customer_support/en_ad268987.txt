Scenario: career counselor, ironic that she can't navigate this company's terrible phone system

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi! So like, funny story—I'm actually a career counselor and I, uh, literally can't figure out your phone menu.

Customer Support: Oh no, I'm so, um, I'm really sorry about that. Let me just, uh, uh, pull up your account here and—yeah the the phone system is, um, honestly terrible. What's what's your account number?

Customer: Right, it's... wait, account number or customer ID?

Customer Support: Either one works! So um, basically they're, uh, they're kind of the same thing in our system which is, er, super confusing I know.

Customer: Okay so... hmm, let me see here... ACC-4920-JT.

Customer Support: Got it got it, um, so that's pulling up as, uh, invalid but but sometimes people mix up—is it maybe, um, JTC-4920 instead?

Customer: Oh! Yes, sorry—wait no, that's my, um, that's actually my license number. Ugh. I help people navigate systems for a living!

Customer Support: No no, totally get it. These codes all look—they're all the same. Okay okay, can I just grab your email?

Customer: Um, yeah it's, uh, karencounselor at... wait, which email did I use? Personal or work?

Customer Support: Let me let me try both! What're what're the options?

Customer: So there's, um, ksmith at careerpath dot com or, uh, wait—actually might be under my old one?

Customer Support: You know what? I'm I'm just gonna search by name. Karen Smith?

Customer: Yep! Though, hmm, might be under K Smith or, um, Katherine? I honestly can't remember what I—

Customer Support: Found you! Account ACC-7823-KLM. So so what happened with the phone menu?

Customer: Um, okay so I pressed 2 for billing then, uh, 4 for... no wait, was it 3 for payments?

Customer Support: Oh oh oh, yeah no. The the menu's backwards. Billing's actually 4 now and and payments is under accounts which is, um, which is 2. We switched it last month and and honestly? Even I can't remember.

Customer: That's—wait, so I had it right the first time? But then, um, why did it send me to Spanish?

Customer Support: Because—and and this is so dumb—if you press 2 twice by accident? It thinks you want español. Your account shows, um, three Spanish preference switches today.

Customer: Oh my god. I tell my clients about terrible UX all day and here I am... This is so ironic.

Customer Support: Listen, um, between you and me? I've worked here two years and and I still get lost. Last week I tried calling in sick and and somehow ordered myself a new modem. Reference number MDM-8827-QX if you can believe it.
