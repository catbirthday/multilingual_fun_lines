=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I need to speak to someone. About my last call. The transcript's wrong.

Customer Support: Alright, let me—hmm, actually let me pull up your account first. Can I get your account number or the phone number on file?

Customer: It's it's 555-0342. I'm a court reporter. I know what was said.

Customer Support: Got it, okay so—wait, let me just—here we go. I see your account, and um, I can pull up the call from November 14th at 3:47 PM. Is that the one you're referring to?

Customer: That's the one. Your agent promised. A full refund. It's not—it's not in there.

Customer Support: Okay let me review this transcript... er, so I'm seeing here the agent offered a partial credit of $47.50, but I don't—actually, hold on. Let me check the audio recording against this.

Customer: See? See? This is what they do. Promise one thing. Write another.

Customer Support: Right so—mmm, I hear your frustration. The audio file is loading now, it's about 14 minutes and 32 seconds long. While that's pulling up, uh, can you tell me specifically what amount was promised?

Customer: Two hundred. Dollars. Exactly. I write—I write this stuff for a living.

Customer Support: I believe you. So here's—actually wait, the audio just loaded. Let me jump to... okay at timestamp 8:14 the agent says, er, "maximum refund of fifty dollars" but then at 11:22 there's something about—hmm, two hundred in future credit?

Customer: No no no. Current refund. Not credit. I've been a customer eight years.

Customer Support: Yeah I—look, I can see the confusion here. The transcript shows code REFUND-50MAX applied but, uh, there's definitely mention of two hundred. Thing is—actually, let me check what your agent's authorization level was.

Customer: Great. Another runaround. This is—this is the third time.

Customer Support: No wait, I'm not—so what I can do, er, I mean I'm limited to certain amounts but... Your agent ID-7749 had Tier 2 authority which caps at $150. But lemme see if I can escalate this.

Customer: I just—I just want what was promised. That's it. That's all.

Customer Support: Absolutely fair. Okay so—hmm, actually here's what I found. There's a note at 11:45 saying "supervisor override pending for $200 refund" but it never... uh, it wasn't processed. That's on us.

Customer: Finally. Someone admits it. So now—now what happens?

Customer Support: Right so I'm gonna—wait actually, I can just... yep. I'm processing the full $200.00 refund right now under override code SUP-HONOR-2847. Should hit your account in 3-5 business days.

Customer: Okay okay okay. And this time. It's documented? Properly?

Customer Support: Yes, absolutely. Reference number is REF-20241122-0847, and uh, I'm also sending you an email confirmation right now to 555-0342 at gmail. Everything's recorded, timestamped, and you'll have it in writing.
