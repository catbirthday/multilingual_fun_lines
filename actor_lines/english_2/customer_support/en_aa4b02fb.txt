Scenario: dog groomer, upset that a customer disputed a charge for services already rendered

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm sorry, I'm just—I'm just really frustrated because basically I groomed this dog and now they're disputing the whole charge?

Customer Support: Um, okay so, uh, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, what I'm seeing is... actually, er, can you give me your business account number so I can, um, look into this dispute for you?

Customer: It's it's under Pampered Paws, sorry, I should've said that first.

Customer Support: Got it, got it, so um, Pampered Paws, and I'm, uh, seeing here account number BUS-4472-PP and there's, hmm, a dispute filed yesterday for, er, let me see... $185 for grooming services rendered on the 15th, is that, um, the one you're calling about?

Customer: Yes exactly, so like I spent three hours on that matted nightmare of a dog!

Customer Support: Right, um, so here's what I can, uh, tell you about dispute code DSP-9901-K... basically the customer is, er, claiming the service wasn't completed as requested, but um, between you and me? I've seen this exact thing before with, uh, grooming services and we usually...

Customer: I'm sorry, I know I'm getting worked up, it's just like they picked up the dog and said everything was fine!

Customer Support: No no, um, totally get it, and uh, here's what we're gonna do... so first, I need you to, er, submit any photos you took, um, before and after shots to reference REF-2024-8812-G, and then, uh, basically we can fast-track this whole thing...

Customer: Oh okay okay, I actually do have photos, sorry, should I send those now?

Customer Support: Um, yeah so, uh, you can upload them directly through your merchant portal under, hmm, let me see... dispute management section, code DSP-9901-K, and er, once those are in, I can, um, basically expedite this to our review team today instead of the usual, uh, five business days.

Customer: So basically you're saying there's a chance I'll get my money back?

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: Because honestly I cannot afford to just eat this loss, I'm sorry, I'm being dramatic.

Customer Support: Oh no, um, listen, between you and me? With documentation case DOC-7734-X, and uh, especially with before and after photos, these disputes, er, they almost always go in favor of the service provider, so um, you're looking at probably, hmm, 90% chance of winning this.

Customer: That's... actually really reassuring, thank you so so much.

Customer Support: Um, and here's something else I can, uh, do for you... so I'm gonna put a note in file FLG-2209-PP that, er, basically flags this as a priority review, which means, um, instead of waiting the full five days, you should, uh, hear back within... probably 48 hours?

Customer: Wait really? I'm sorry, I came in so hot about this.

Customer Support: Happens all the time, um, seriously, and uh, one more thing? I'm seeing you've been with us, er, three years with account BUS-4472-PP, never had a dispute before, so um, that actually really helps your case here because, uh, it shows a pattern of, you know...

Customer: Right right, okay I'll upload those photos right now then.

Customer Support: Perfect, um, and just so you know, once you upload to REF-2024-8812-G, you'll get an, uh, automatic confirmation email, and then, er, I'll personally monitor this under my agent code AGT-5501 to make sure it, um, gets processed quickly, sound good?
