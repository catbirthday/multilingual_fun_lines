Scenario: dental hygienist, embarrassed she forgot to cancel a subscription for six months

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm so sorry, this is embarrassing but I just realized I never canceled my subscription...

Customer Support: No no no, don't even worry about it, we're absolutely going to get this sorted out for you right now, let me just pull up your account real quick, can I get your email address to find you in the system?

Customer: Um, it's, uh, sarah.chen at dentalcare, um, dot com. God, I feel so stupid about this.

Customer Support: Got it, perfect, okay so I'm seeing account ID ACC-9847-SCH here and, hmm, let me see here, you've had the premium subscription active since, okay so that's February, March, April, May, June, July, so about six months total at $14.99 per month.

Customer: Yeah, I'm a dental hygienist so I'm literally telling patients about preventive care all day and then I can't even...

Customer Support: Listen, this happens all the time, I mean seriously we're going to fix this, no judgment at all, so what I can do right now is cancel this immediately, transaction ID TXN-884729-CAN processing as we speak, and then let's talk about getting you some money back.

Customer: Um, I mean, uh, that would be amazing but like, I know it's my fault so...

Customer Support: Absolutely not.

Customer: Sorry?

Customer Support: Um, okay so, uh, here's what we're doing, I'm looking at your usage history and, hmm, you haven't logged in since, uh, February 15th, reference number REF-2847-LOG, so basically you paid for six months without using the service even once, right?

Customer: So basically yeah, I signed up to try the meditation thing because work stress and then just...

Customer Support: Right right, exactly, so I'm putting through a refund request, um, let me see here, I think we can probably get you at least four months back, maybe five, your case number is CSE-9984-RF and I'm marking this as, uh, service not utilized.

Customer: Oh my god, um, that's so, uh, I mean you really don't have to, I should've remembered to cancel.

Customer Support: No seriously, this is what I'm here for, we want customers actually using what they pay for, not just, you know, forgetting about it, so I'm escalating this with priority code PRI-448-HIGH and putting a note that you're in healthcare which means crazy hours.

Customer: Um, wow, I actually, uh, like I clean teeth all day and tell people about flossing and somehow I can't manage my own...

Customer Support: Hmm, what if we do this, so I'm seeing here in your original signup form ORD-1147-FEB that you selected stress management as your goal, I could probably get you a courtesy credit for trying again when you're actually ready, reference code CRD-8874-SM.

Customer: That's really nice but honestly after six months of paying for nothing I should probably just...

Customer Support: Okay so, um, I'm putting through the full refund for five months, that's $74.95, confirmation RFD-9984-FULL, and uh, basically it'll hit your card ending in 4782 within three to five business days, probably sooner honestly.

Customer: I can't believe you're doing this, um, like, seriously, I'm so embarrassed but this is, uh, really really helpful.

Customer Support: Listen, between you and me, I've got three subscriptions I keep meaning to cancel myself, so no judgment whatsoever, your cancellation is confirmed with code CNL-8829-COMPLETE and you should get an email in about two minutes with everything we discussed, reference number EML-7749-SUMM.
