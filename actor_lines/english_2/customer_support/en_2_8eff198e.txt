=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So I'm looking at these charges and they're not—I mean nothing matches what we ordered, and if accounting sees this...

Customer Support: Oh gosh, inventory discrepancies, yeah I actually dealt with one of these yesterday. Let me pull up your account, um, what's your company ID?

Customer: It's EQ-4492, but wait there's also this thing where some items are double-billed and others aren't even...

Customer Support: Got it, EQ-4492. Hmm, okay I'm seeing—wait no, that's not—sorry, let me get into the right system. Purchase order management is kind of finicky.

Customer: Finicky? We're talking about seventeen thousand dollars worth of equipment that just...

Customer Support: Seventeen thousand, woah. Alright so I think what happened—er, looking at batch B-7739-NC here—someone probably uploaded the wrong CSV file. Happens more than you'd think actually.

Customer: A CSV error? But how does that even—we submitted everything correctly on our end, I triple-checked before...

Customer Support: No no, I believe you. On your side it's perfect. The issue is, hmm, when it hits our processing center—order PRO-8827-X—sometimes the fields get scrambled if there's, sort of, any special characters.

Customer: Special characters? We don't use—oh wait, the ampersand in "Tools & Equipment", would that...

Customer Support: Bingo. That'd do it. I had a customer last week, same exact thing. Let me just, uh, manually reconcile these line items real quick.

Customer: But what about the double charges? Those are already hitting our credit line and if we can't order next quarter's supplies...

Customer Support: Right right, the duplicates. So transaction TXN-90442-KL and, er, TXN-90443-KL are definitely the same order. I can reverse one right now, probably take two business days to show.

Customer: Two days? Our CFO is reviewing accounts tomorrow morning and if she sees...

Customer Support: Ooh, tomorrow morning's tight. Tell you what though, I'm gonna flag this as priority—case number CSE-1147-PRO—and, well, maybe email you a confirmation you can show her?

Customer: That would help but there's still three items that show as "pending verification" whatever that...

Customer Support: Pending verification means, um, basically our warehouse is physically checking stock. Items SKU-7742, SKU-7743, and—hold on—SKU-7745. Should clear by tonight honestly.

Customer: Tonight? Okay but if they don't clear, then what happens to our standing order for next month...

Customer Support: Your standing order's safe. Different system entirely. Though actually, let me just, hmm, make a note here so billing knows to skip the auto-charge until we sort this mess.

Customer: Skip the auto-charge? No wait, we need those supplies to ship, if you skip it then...

Customer Support: Oh sorry, I mean—not skip skip. Just postpone the charge, not the shipment. Order stays on schedule, invoice gets fixed, everybody's happy.
