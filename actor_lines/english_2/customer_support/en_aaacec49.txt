Scenario: career counselor, ironic that she can't navigate this company's terrible phone system

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Um, hi, uh... I just spent, er, twenty minutes in your... system? And I, um, I help people with this stuff.

Customer Support: Oh no, I know exactly what you mean—our IVR is brutal. Let me just pull up your account, what's your name?

Customer: Sarah Chen. Um, it's just... I literally, uh, coach people on phone interviews and, er... couldn't find billing.

Customer Support: Sarah, I think I've got you here, account SCH-4429-NK. And um, honestly? I get lost in our own system sometimes, so, uh, you're definitely not alone there.

Customer: Wait, really? You work there and...

Customer Support: Oh absolutely, um, like just last week I was trying to, uh, help my mom navigate it from the outside and I, er, I gave up and just handled it internally.

Customer: Okay but, um, how do I, uh... know you're not just... saying that to, er, make me feel better?

Customer Support: Fair question! So your last call was seventeen days ago, reference number REF-8827-QP, about updating payment method, right?

Customer: That's... um, yeah. Wow. Okay so, uh, you can actually, er... see all that?

Customer Support: Everything, yeah. So um, what couldn't you find today? I can, uh, probably shortcut this whole thing for you.

Customer: Billing. Just... wanted to check a charge.

Customer Support: Got it, so um, I'm seeing a charge from October 15th, transaction TXN-993847-BC for $47.99, and then, uh, another one yesterday for the same amount.

Customer: Um, wait, yesterday? That's, uh... that shouldn't... I mean, er, is that real?

Customer Support: Looking closer here—yeah, duplicate charge, system glitch. I'm reversing it now, confirmation RVS-2847-MM should hit your account in 2-3 days.

Customer: You can just... do that? Right now?

Customer Support: I mean, um, technically I'm supposed to, uh, file a dispute form first but, er, it's obviously our mistake, so...

Customer: But won't you, um, get in... I mean, uh, if someone checks or, er...

Customer Support: Honestly? My supervisor probably would've done the same thing. Case number CSE-7736-PL for your records though, just in case.

Customer: This is, um... not what I expected. Like, uh, at all. Usually it's just, er... "sorry, nothing we can do."

Customer Support: Yeah, I, um, I wish I could fix the phone system too but, uh, that one's above my pay grade unfortunately. Anything else though?
