Speaker [en]: [extremely happy] I knew it! I fucking knew it! Three years ago when I saw those canvases in that dingy studio, everyone thought I was—well, [laugh loudly] they thought I was completely insane. But honestly, there was just something about the way she used light, you know? [warm] Like she was painting with actual sunlight somehow. 

[pause] And tonight, I mean—the Guggenheim people were there. [very excited] The actual Guggenheim! Her piece, um, the one with the fractured mirrors? [passionately] Someone offered two hundred thousand on the spot. Two hundred! For an artist who was literally painting in her grandmother's garage six months ago. 

[relieved] God, I was so nervous she wouldn't show up. She almost didn't, actually—[chuckle] had to basically drag her out of the bathroom where she was having a panic attack. But then, [proudly speaking] watching her talk to those collectors, seeing them finally get what I've been seeing all along... 

[shaky voice] My hands are still trembling. Like, this is why I do this job, right? [very sincerely] Not for the commission, though obviously that's nice, but for this exact moment when someone who deserves it, [emotional] someone who's been grinding and creating in obscurity finally, finally gets their shot. [sigh] We did it. We actually fucking did it.
