Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] God, I can't stop thinking about what almost happened today. Like, um, we were rigging the main stunt sequence—you know the one with the car flip—and honestly, I noticed something was off with the cable tension. [pause] Just... something didn't feel right.

So I called for a full stop. [anxious] And the AD was pissed, right? Because we're already behind schedule and, I mean, every minute costs thousands. But here's the thing—I implemented this double-check protocol after that incident in Vancouver last year, and it's like, [confidently], non-negotiable for me now.

Anyway, uh, when we ran the diagnostics, [gasp softly] the primary support beam had a hairline fracture. If we'd gone ahead with the stunt... Jesus. [very quietly] Three people would've been directly underneath when it failed.

The stunt coordinator just—he actually hugged me. [relieved] Said I saved lives today. And honestly, it's not about being a hero or whatever, it's just... [passionately] this is why we have protocols! This is why I'm such a pain in the ass about safety checks!

[warm] Tomorrow we're doing a full team debrief, and, well, I think everyone finally gets why I'm so obsessive about this stuff. [sigh] God, what a day.
