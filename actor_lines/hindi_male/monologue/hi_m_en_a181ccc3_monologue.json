[clearing throat] They said the sommelier specifically requested it after reading that article about our family vineyard. [proudly] Four generations of winemakers and now—[gasp softly] oh God, what if something happens during transport? [anxious] What if the temperature fluctuates or—no, no, stop it Sophie. [confidently] This is our moment. \n\n[warm] Mom used to say our grapes grew different because we sang to them. [chuckle] I thought she was crazy but, I mean, here we are.
