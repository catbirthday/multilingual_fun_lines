Speaker [en]: [upset] Five years. Um, five whole years of my life, and they just—they tell me in a ten-minute meeting that it's over. [bitter] "Budget constraints," they said. Like, as if I don't know what that means—it means the donors found something shinier, you know? [pause] 

I mean, honestly, what about the kids in our after-school program? Hmm? What happens to them now? [shaky voice] Maria was finally starting to open up about her home situation, and Carlos just got into that mentorship program we fought so hard to—[sigh] God, this is just... 

[frustrated] The thing is, er, I knew the grants were getting harder to secure, but I thought—I guess I thought we had more time. Like, we literally just renovated the community space. [very quietly] All those late nights writing proposals, basically living in that office... [pause]

[anxious] So now what? I'm thirty-seven, and uh, my entire career has been at this one nonprofit. My mortgage is due next week. [sad] And honestly, it's not even about me—well, okay, partly it is—but those families, they're gonna show up Monday and find the doors locked. [crying while speaking] I can't even call them all personally because, um, they took my work phone already. 

[very sad] Five years of building something that actually mattered, and it's just... gone.
