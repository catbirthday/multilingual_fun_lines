Speaker [en]: I wasn't sure if I should even, um, send this email but I just—I had to tell you. [hesitantly] It's been what, like, five years since I took your creative writing class? And honestly, I don't think you realize what you did for me. I was so lost back then, you know? Just completely... [trailing off] I mean, my parents wanted me to be an engineer, and I was basically failing everything because I hated it so much. [emotional] But then in your class, when you, uh, pulled me aside after that first story I wrote? The one about my grandmother? [pause] You said I had a voice worth sharing. Nobody had ever—[shaky voice] sorry, I'm getting kind of emotional here. But like, that conversation literally changed everything. I switched majors the next week. [laugh] My parents freaked out, obviously. But here's the thing—I just published my second novel. [very excited] Can you believe that? And it's actually doing well! I'm supporting myself as a writer, which is just... [warm] None of this would've happened without you believing in me when I couldn't even, you know, believe in myself. So, um, thank you. [very sincerely] Really, thank you for seeing something in me that I didn't even know was there.
