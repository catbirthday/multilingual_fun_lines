Speaker [en]: Oh my God. Oh my— [gasp] it's actually there. Front page. [extremely happy] Right there with my photo and everything! I mean, um, this is the same idea that my own dad called— [bitter] what was it? "Financial suicide"? [laugh] Yeah, that's the one. 

[excited] And like, everyone at that startup meetup, they literally laughed when I pitched it! [speeding up] Remember Marcus? He said I should, you know, "maybe try something more realistic"— [mocking] more realistic! [belly laugh] God, I can't even—

She's, er, she's the only one who— [trailing off] [sniffle] Sorry, I just— [shaky voice] three years of everyone saying I was basically delusional, and now it's like—here's the thing, [confidently] I knew it would work. Deep down I always— [stuttering] I-I-I always knew.

[very quietly] But honestly? Some nights I almost quit. [long pause] Almost.
