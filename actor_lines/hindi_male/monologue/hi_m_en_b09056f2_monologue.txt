Speaker [en]: [confused] Twenty-three percent. That's, um, that's what it says. Twenty-three percent Eastern European. Dad's—I mean, the man I've called Dad for thirty-two years is like, one hundred percent Irish. So that's... [pause] that's not possible, right? Unless—oh God. 

Well, I keep refreshing the page thinking maybe it's, you know, some kind of error. But it's not changing. [shaky voice] The thing is, Mom always said I had his eyes. Actually, everyone said that. "You look just like your father." Hmm, which father though, right? 

I guess I should—I don't even know what I should do. [cry] Call Mom? Basically demand she explain why she's been lying to me my entire life? Or, er, maybe she thought I knew? No, that's—that's ridiculous. 

[bitter] You know what's funny? I spent literally years defending him when people said we looked nothing alike. [whispering] "Genetics are weird," I'd say. Yeah, turns out they're pretty straightforward actually.

So now what? I mean, do I tell him? [anxious] Does he know? Has he always known? The thing is, he taught me to ride a bike, walked me down the aisle, held my daughter when she was born. [long pause] That's still real, right? Like, that happened. 

[very quietly] I just... I don't know who I am anymore.
