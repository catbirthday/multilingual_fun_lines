Speaker [en]: [gasp] Oh my God, I just got off the call with the industry council and they're—they're actually doing it. The whole training program, like, every single module we developed is going nationwide. [laugh] I mean, honestly, when we started this thing two years ago in that tiny facility in Ohio, it was just—we were literally just trying to fix our own safety issues, you know? 

[shaky voice] And now they're saying, um, forty thousand workers are gonna be trained using our materials by next quarter. Forty thousand! That's—[pause]—I keep thinking about Carlos, actually. Remember how he lost his finger because nobody ever showed him the proper blade technique? [emotional] That's why we started all this, right? Because people were getting hurt and, I mean, the old training was basically "here's your hairnet, don't die."

[excited] But now it's like—wait, sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself—but the standardization committee said our injury rates dropped seventy percent! [speeding up] And they want me to present at the conference, and honestly I'm kind of terrified because what if—[trail off]

[warm] No, you know what? This is good. This is really, really good. We're gonna save fingers, er, save lives even. [chuckle] God, I need to call my mom.
