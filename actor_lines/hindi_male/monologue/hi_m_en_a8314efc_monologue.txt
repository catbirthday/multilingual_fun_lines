=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [gasp loudly] Oh my God, I—what is all this? [confused] I don't understand, um, how did you even know it was my birthday? We barely... I mean, we've lived together for like eight months and we've maybe had three actual conversations? [very quietly] I thought you didn't even know my last name.

[pause] 

Wait, is that—did you make my favorite cake? How did you... [shaky voice] I mentioned that exactly once when my mom called and I was in the kitchen. You were wearing headphones, I didn't think you could hear—

[emotional] This is really for me? All these people, they're actually here for me? [laugh] I've been eating cereal alone in my room every birthday since I moved here because I thought, well, I assumed you just tolerated me being here, you know? Like I was just the person who paid half the rent and sometimes left dishes in the sink.

[crying while speaking] You got streamers in my favorite color. You remembered I hate balloons but love streamers. I can't—

[very sincerely] I've been so lonely, and this whole time you were actually paying attention? [happy] This is the nicest thing anyone's done for me in... God, I don't even know how long. Thank you. Really, just—thank you.
