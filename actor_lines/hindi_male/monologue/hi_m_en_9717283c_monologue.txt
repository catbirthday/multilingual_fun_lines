[sigh] My kid's tuition is due next month. 

[regretful] Marcus taught me everything, you know? Showed me how to, er, align the folding plates just right, how to listen for that clicking sound when the, um—[stuttering] when the b-binding gets jammed. He was so patient. [trailing off] And I just stood there while they blamed him for...
