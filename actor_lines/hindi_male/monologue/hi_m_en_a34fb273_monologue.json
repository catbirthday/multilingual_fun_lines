I mean, that's literally what I do—I make the sport work for people. So we spent, what, [slowly] three hours that first day? Testing grips, adjusting the thumb pitch, moving the finger holes way left to compensate for his, uh, his throwing motion now. [excited] The precision work, it's like—it's like sculpting, honestly. Every sixteenth of an inch matters.\n\n[chuckle] He threw gutter balls for weeks. Just... gutter after gutter. But he kept coming back, and I kept tweaking. [empathetically] Then last Tuesday, he rolls his first strike in fifteen years, and— [gasp softly] God, he just breaks down crying right there on lane seven. [crying while speaking] I'm standing behind the counter trying not to lose it myself because... [relieved] that's why I do this. That's exactly why I do this."
