Speaker [en]: [frustrated] I can't—I literally can't believe they just sat there and, um, dismissed everything. [pause] Three months of data, you know? Three months of documented cardiac events, and they're just... [bitter] "Not statistically significant," they said. [sarcastic] Right. Tell that to the seventeen people who ended up in the ER last month. 

[angry] I mean, honestly, what am I even doing here? [shaky voice] We're supposed to be protecting people, that's like—that's literally our job, and instead we're, what, [mocking] "managing risk profiles"? [disgusted grunt] Sorry, I mean, protecting shareholder value.

[quietly] The thing is, uh, I know what happens next. [anxious] They'll push this through FDA approval anyway, and then... [trail off] God, I keep thinking about that woman's chart, the one with the, er, the two kids. [very sad] Twenty-eight years old. 

[sigh] Maybe I should've been more, I don't know, politically savvy about it? [regretful] Instead of just, you know, presenting the raw data like some kind of... [pause] But that's the thing—the data speaks for itself! [passionate] Or it should, anyway. 

[exhausted] I guess I could, um, leak it? [nervous laugh] Jesus, listen to me. [whispering] Five years at this company and now I'm thinking about becoming a whistleblower.
