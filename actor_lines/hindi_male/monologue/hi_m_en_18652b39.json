[frustrated] And I get it, I do, collaboration is usually the way, but this project was, um... it was different. [confidently] I knew exactly what needed to happen, and having to explain my vision to five other people would've just slowed everything down. [laugh] Look at me now though! [excited] Three weeks ahead of schedule, under budget, and the client is absolutely thrilled. [smugly] Meanwhile, the other teams are still stuck in their endless brainstorming sessions. [chuckle] I mean, I'm not saying collaboration is bad—it's not. [sincerely] But sometimes, sometimes you just know when something needs your full, undivided attention without the, uh, without the committee decisions. [triumphant] This was my baby from start to finish. [relieved] And honestly? [pause] The silence while I worked was exactly what I needed. [warm] No meetings, no consensus-building, just me and the work. [satisfied] Turns out the lone wolf approach isn't dead after all."
