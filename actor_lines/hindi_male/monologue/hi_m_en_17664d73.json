[pause] I was always the weird one asking \"but why do we do it this way?\" when everyone else just, um, accepted things. [bitter] God, I hated feeling so outside of everything. [sigh] But now at work, it's like—that's literally my superpower. [excited] Yesterday in the meeting, everyone's nodding along to the same old strategy and I'm like \"wait wait wait, what if we approached this completely differently?\" [laugh] And they actually listen! [warm] Because I see things they don't. All those years of being on the outside, I was basically, hmm, training myself to notice patterns no one else catches. [very sincerely] The CEO literally told me last week that my perspective is why we're ahead of our competitors. [pause] Like, I'm the one who spots opportunities because I've never, um... I've never been able to think the normal way. [chuckle] Those kids who made me feel broken? [confidently] They're probably in some cubicle doing exactly what they're told, while I'm here changing how an entire industry thinks."
