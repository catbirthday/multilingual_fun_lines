Speaker [en]: Twenty-three years I've been at that plant. Twenty-three. [bitter] And for what, honestly? We organized, we—I mean, we really thought the union would actually back us this time. [frustrated] Like, we had the votes, you know? Everyone signed those cards, um, everyone showed up to the meetings even though they were scared. 

[sigh] Martinez got fired first, then basically half of second shift. And what did our rep say? [mocking] "We need to follow proper channels." Proper channels while, uh, while people are losing their houses? [angry] I can't even look at Rodriguez anymore, I told him—no wait, I promised him—that if we stuck together, err, if we all just stayed united... 

[very sad] His kid's got medical bills, and I stood there telling him the union would protect us. [pause] The thing is, I really believed it, you know? Like an idiot, I guess. [quietly] All those nights organizing, and then corporate just... they didn't even negotiate. Just pink slips. Done.

[exhausted] So now what, right? I'm fifty-two, and suddenly I'm supposed to just, what, start over? [bitter] "Retraining opportunities," they said. [laugh] Yeah, okay. Retraining for what exactly? [trailing off] I don't even know anymore...
