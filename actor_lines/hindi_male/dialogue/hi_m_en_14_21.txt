Character 1 [en]: So, um, these numbers you're reading, are they, you know, basically for the final offer?

Character 2 [en]: Well, yeah, these are, er, the inspection costs and kind of the closing fees, actually. Let me start with the mosaic restoration in the entryway—that's coming in at $3,200, which includes all the vintage tiles I'll need to source.

Character 1 [en]: That's honestly higher than, [very sincerely], I expected, uh, but I mean, I trust your expertise.

Character 2 [en]: So, I know it sounds high, but uhh, the thing is, matching those 1920s patterns is like finding buried treasure. Next up, the foundation repair estimate is $8,500, and the roof replacement is coming in at $12,300.

Character 1 [en]: Wow, um, I'm feeling, [shy], sort of overwhelmed by all these, anyway, big numbers.

Character 2 [en]: Hey, I totally get it—buying a fixer-upper is scary. The plumbing update is $4,800, electrical rewiring is $6,200, and honestly, those are both really reasonable quotes from contractors I trust.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, you know, what about the, really, what about the kitchen?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, well, [relieved], the kitchen is actually in better shape than we thought. Cabinet refacing is only $2,100, new appliances will run about $5,500, and I can do a gorgeous mosaic backsplash for $1,800.

Character 1 [en]: And the bathrooms?

Character 2 [en]: Both bathrooms together are looking at $9,400 for full renovation. But here's the good news—I can incorporate some salvaged tiles from my workshop, which will give them amazing character without extra cost.

Character 1 [en]: These numbers are, [shaky voice], making my head spin a little.

Character 2 [en]: I know, err, it's a lot to process, basically, but I guess the total renovation budget is coming in at $54,600. That's actually below the $60,000 we initially estimated, and this house will be absolutely stunning when we're done.

Character 1 [en]: Below budget? That's unexpected.

Character 2 [en]: Right? And uh, here's something else—the seller's credits are, honestly, $7,500, which kind of helps offset things. Plus, the home warranty they're including covers $1,200 worth of potential issues for the first year.

Character 1 [en]: What about your mosaic work specifically?

Character 2 [en]: So my work, um, [very quietly], you know, it's just that I'm charging $8,400 total for all three installations. That includes the entryway restoration, the kitchen backsplash, and a custom piece for the master bathroom—all with materials included.

Character 1 [en]: That seems really reasonable for custom art.

Character 2 [en]: Thank you! The closing costs are $6,300, property taxes for the year are $4,200, and homeowner's insurance is quoting at $1,800 annually.

Character 1 [en]: Well, uhh, when you add it all up, it's sort of terrifying but exciting?

Character 2 [en]: So, I mean, yes it's a big investment, but hmm, this house has incredible bones, and actually, with these renovations, you're looking at adding probably $80,000 in value. These numbers are just the beginning of something really beautiful.
