Character 1 [en]: Hi there! I'm Sarah, your [extremely happy] peer counselor for today's session. Is this your first time at the wellness center?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, um, fantastic—another [sarcastic] peppy volunteer who thinks, you know, a chat and some breathing exercises will fix my existential dread. But yeah, it's my first time, I guess.

Character 1 [en]: I, uh, totally get the skepticism, actually. Most people think we're, like, going to force positivity down their throats.

Character 2 [en]: Sorry, that was... I mean, that was [very sad] harsh. I've been, well, kind of attacking everyone who tries to help lately—it's basically my new defense mechanism.

Character 1 [en]: Hey, no judgment here. Attack away if it helps. Better than keeping it all bottled up, right?

Character 2 [en]: You're different from what I expected. Most counselors start with the whole "how does that make you feel" routine or immediately suggest I journal about my childhood trauma.

Character 1 [en]: Journaling is, er, overrated anyway. I mean, who has time to, you know, write poetry about their pain when Netflix exists?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly! My last therapist, um, wanted me to write [cry] gratitude lists while I can barely, like, get out of bed most mornings. The thing is, I haven't slept properly in three weeks.

Character 1 [en]: Three weeks? That's, well, that's rough. What keeps you up—racing thoughts, or, I mean, is it more like anxiety about specific stuff?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, just the usual—impending climate doom, student loans I'll never [condescending] pay off, and whether I'm slowly morphing into my emotionally unavailable father. You know, light bedtime thoughts that definitely promote restful sleep.

Character 1 [en]: Your father thing—that's, um, actually something I wrestle with too. Like, I catch myself doing his disappointed sigh sometimes and, honestly, want to scream.

Character 2 [en]: Wait, you actually relate? This isn't some [excited] counselor trick where you pretend to understand? Because I've had enough people minimize my issues while secretly thinking I'm dramatic.

Character 1 [en]: No tricks. I'm here because I crashed and burned spectacularly last year. Now I help others to make sense of my own mess.

Character 2 [en]: That's... that's refreshingly [whispering] honest. Most people here pretend they've got it all together. You're saying you're just as screwed up as the rest of us?

Character 1 [en]: Oh, I'm, uh, probably [shy] worse, honestly. Last semester I, well, had a panic attack during my own therapy certification exam—kind of ironic, right?

Character 2 [en]: You had a panic attack DURING [shouting] your therapy exam?! That's actually hilarious—sorry, I shouldn't laugh, but the irony is killing me here!

Character 1 [en]: No, please [groan] laugh! I literally wrote "help me" on the exam paper instead of answering question three.

Character 2 [en]: Okay, that tops my breakdown story. I just ugly-cried in the campus Starbucks when they got my order wrong—barista gave me free coffee for a month out of sheer terror.

Character 1 [en]: The Starbucks on, um, Fifth Street? Because I [sniffle] definitely saw that happen and, er, it wasn't that bad—you know, comparatively speaking.

Character 2 [en]: You saw that?! Oh god, that's, um, mortifying but also [whispering] weirdly comforting. So, basically, we're both disasters pretending to be functional adults—want to, you know, compare coping mechanisms that don't actually work?
