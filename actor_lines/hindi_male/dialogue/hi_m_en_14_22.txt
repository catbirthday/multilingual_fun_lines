Character 1 [en]: So um, this experimental design is, [bitter], basically flawed, you know, from the start?

Character 2 [en]: No, actually the design is perfectly sound. We're using a double-blind randomized control trial with three treatment groups and appropriate statistical power—this methodology has been validated in over forty similar studies.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, what about the, er, sample size? It seems sort of small to me.

Character 2 [en]: The sample size of 240 participants is honestly more than adequate, uh, with 80 participants per group giving us like 95% power to detect a medium effect size. I ran the power analysis three times using different software packages, and they all confirm this is statistically robust.

Character 1 [en]: But the control group seems weird.

Character 2 [en]: The control group is [bitter] exactly what we need for this study. They're receiving the standard treatment protocol, which gives us a perfect baseline for comparing the two experimental interventions—this is textbook experimental design.

Character 1 [en]: What about confounding variables?

Character 2 [en]: We've controlled for [upset] every major confound through stratified randomization. Age, gender, baseline scores, medication history, and socioeconomic status are all balanced across groups, plus we're using ANCOVA to adjust for any remaining variance.

Character 1 [en]: So, hmm, how long will this actually take to run?

Character 2 [en]: Twelve weeks for [speeding up] the intervention phase, then six months of follow-up. The timeline is aggressive but completely doable—I've managed three similar studies with even tighter deadlines, and we finished ahead of schedule.

Character 1 [en]: The ethics approval seems complicated.

Character 2 [en]: Already handled. The IRB gave full approval last week with no modifications required, and I've secured consent forms that exceed all federal requirements for human subjects research.

Character 1 [en]: Err, what about, anyway, the kind of statistical analysis you're planning?

Character 2 [en]: Mixed-effects modeling with intention-to-treat analysis as primary, per-protocol as secondary. This approach handles missing data optimally and gives us both efficacy and effectiveness estimates—it's the gold standard for clinical trials.

Character 1 [en]: Uhh, the thing is, your budget looks [mocking] optimistic, I guess.

Character 2 [en]: The budget is locked in with 15% contingency built in. I've negotiated fixed rates with all vendors, secured the lab space at a 40% discount, and our grant covers everything with $50,000 to spare.

Character 1 [en]: Right so, you know, what about recruitment? That's ah, always the hardest part.

Character 2 [en]: Recruitment is it's just that we're already at 60% enrollment, umm, three weeks before we really need to start. I have partnerships with five clinics, social media campaigns running, and a waiting list of 85 interested participants.

Character 1 [en]: Hmmm, basically your confidence is, okay so, either impressive or concerning?

Character 2 [en]: It's confidence based on experience and preparation. I've published twelve papers using this exact methodology, trained under the researcher who developed this protocol, and every single metric indicates this study will succeed.
