Character 1 [en]: [furious] Why did you merge that branch without running the tests first?

Character 2 [en]: Oh geez, um, I thought the CI pipeline would catch any issues automatically? I mean, it's been passing on my local build for the past three days, so I figured, you know, it was probably safe to go ahead with it.

Character 1 [en]: The entire production server is down. Everything.

Character 2 [en]: [stuttering] W-wait, the the production server? I thought I was merging to staging, I mean, the branch name was, uh, it said feature dash staging dash updates, so I just assumed that would go to the staging environment first?

Character 1 [en]: [very excited] Oh my god, you merged directly to main? That's incredible!

Character 2 [en]: Alright so, hang on, I'm checking the commit history now and, uhh, yeah okay I see what happened. The branch naming was honestly super confusing because someone renamed it yesterday without updating the PR description, which is, I guess, partly my fault for not double-checking but also like, shouldn't there be safeguards?

Character 1 [en]: How long to roll it back?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, probably about fifteen minutes if we just revert the commit? But honestly, there's a bigger issue here because, uh, some of the database migrations already ran, so we might need to manually fix those tables, which could take, I don't know, maybe an hour total?

Character 1 [en]: An hour? The CEO is literally texting me right now.

Character 2 [en]: [long pause] Yeah, okay, um. So here's what I'm thinking—we could actually just cherry-pick the working commits from two hours ago and push those as a hotfix while I'm fixing the migration issues in parallel, you know? That way we get something up in like five minutes.

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] Wow, cherry-picking. What a revolutionary solution. Why didn't I think of that?

Character 2 [en]: Look, I get that you're frustrated and, honestly, I'm pretty stressed too right now. But, uh, being sarcastic isn't really helping us fix this any faster, so maybe we could just focus on getting the site back up and then do a proper post-mortem later?

Character 1 [en]: Fine. What do you need from me?

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Alright, perfect! So if you could handle the customer-facing communication, that would be huge, and maybe draft a quick status page update? Meanwhile I'll get the rollback going and, um, ping the database team just in case we need their help with those migrations.

Character 1 [en]: Database team is offline. It's 2 AM in Prague.

Character 2 [en]: Oh shoot, right, I forgot about the time difference. Okay well, I mean, I've done similar migration fixes before, so I think I can handle it solo. Worst case scenario, we wake up Jan, but let's, uh, let's try to avoid that if possible because he was up until 4 AM yesterday debugging that payment gateway issue.

Character 1 [en]: The hotfix is ready. Should I push it?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, go for it, but wait—actually, hold on, let me just double-check the rollback script one more time because, err, I want to make absolutely sure we're not going to cascade into another problem here. Okay yeah, looks good, push it whenever you're ready.

Character 1 [en]: [monotone] Pushed. Site's back up. Migrations still broken though.

Character 2 [en]: Woof, okay, at least that's something. I'll spend the next hour sorting out the migration mess and, honestly, after this we really need to talk about implementing better branch protection rules because this whole situation could've been avoided with like, two checkboxes in the repo settings.
