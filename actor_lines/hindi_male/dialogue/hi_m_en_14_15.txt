Character 1 [en]: So, um, you're really going to [joking] break into the observatory tonight with, like, just a paperclip and... what, exactly?

Character 2 [en]: A paperclip, three magnets from my grandmother's fridge, and an expired campus ID from 2019. The security system hasn't been updated since the Cold War—I calculated a 97% success rate if we move during the guard's bathroom break.

Character 1 [en]: You, uh, calculated his bathroom schedule? That's... well, that's actually kind of disturbing, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Every Tuesday at 11:47 PM, like clockwork—poor guy has [warm] irritable bowel syndrome from the cafeteria chili. Look, I'm not proud of the surveillance, but astronomical discoveries wait for no one's digestive system.

Character 1 [en]: What if, I mean, we get caught? My scholarship... honestly, my entire future depends on not, er, getting expelled.

Character 2 [en]: Expelled? Please. We're not stealing anything—we're correcting a fundamental error in their asteroid trajectory calculations that could literally save humanity from extinction in 2087. If anything, they should give us honorary degrees.

Character 1 [en]: You can't be serious about the asteroid thing.

Character 2 [en]: Dead serious. Their margin of error is off by 0.0003%—sounds tiny, right? But compound that over sixty-three years and boom, we're talking Manhattan-sized space rock versus harmless fly-by.

Character 1 [en]: Why not just... email them?

Character 2 [en]: Tried that. Six times. They think I'm a crackpot undergraduate who watches too much sci-fi—which, fair, guilty as charged—but my math is solid.

Character 1 [en]: Your "solid math" also said we could build a functioning rocket out of Diet Coke and Mentos.

Character 2 [en]: That was different! The thrust-to-weight [laugh hard] ratio was theoretically sound until Karen from housing called the fire department. Besides, we got seventeen feet of vertical lift before structural failure—that's not nothing!

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, um, hypothetically—and I'm [speeding up] not saying yes—but, like, how exactly would we, you know, even get past the main entrance?

Character 2 [en]: Through the heating vents, obviously. I've been mapping the HVAC system for three months—Tuesday night they reduce airflow to save energy, making it perfectly safe for human traversal.

Character 1 [en]: The vents? That's... actually, that's your plan? We're not, I mean, action heroes—well, you're barely five-foot-four!

Character 2 [en]: Five-foot-three-and-three-quarters, thank you very much. And that's exactly why it'll work—I'm the perfect size for those ducts, plus I've been doing yoga specifically to prepare for this.

Character 1 [en]: You've been doing yoga... to, er, prepare for breaking and entering? That's, honestly, the most you thing I've ever heard.

Character 2 [en]: Look, it's basically just aggressive astronomy at this point. And, um, technically it's not breaking if nothing, you know, actually breaks—we're more like... temporarily borrowing their telescope to save Earth.

Character 1 [en]: I can't believe I'm, well, even considering this. My mom would, like, literally kill me if she knew I was, uh, discussing felonies with the campus genius-slash-lunatic.

Character 2 [en]: Genius-slash-lunatic? That's the nicest thing [flirtatious] anyone's called me all semester. Come on, when we save the world, your mom will forgive you—plus, I promise to name the asteroid after you when we're heroes.
