Character 1 [en]: So, um, you've been fixing bikes here for, like, how long now, I mean, in this shop?

Character 2 [en]: Oh well, going on twelve years [very loudly] now! Started as an apprentice, you know, when I was nineteen, and honestly, my hands have been covered in grease ever since.

Character 1 [en]: Must be tough on your back, all that bending over bikes.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, my back is [stuttering] sh-shot to hell, honestly, and my knees creak like an old door, but that's the trade for you—bodies aren't meant to be bent over bike frames eight hours a day.

Character 1 [en]: Do you [shy] ever think about doing something else?

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes, uhh, when it's raining and my arthritis acts up, I mean, I dream about a desk job, but honestly, the thought of being stuck inside all day without actually, like, making something with my hands—that'd kill me faster than the back pain.

Character 1 [en]: What's the worst repair you've had to deal with?

Character 2 [en]: Had this kid bring in a bike last week that looked like it went through a wood chipper—every single component was destroyed, took me fourteen hours over three days just to make it rideable again.

Character 1 [en]: That's, err, a lot of work for one bike, you know, was it even, basically, worth it?

Character 2 [en]: Financially? Hell no, but, umm, the look on that kid's face when he saw it working again, I guess, that's why I keep doing this even when my body, like, screams at me to stop.

Character 1 [en]: Your hands look pretty beat up.

Character 2 [en]: Oh these things? [laugh loudly] They're basically just scar tissue and calluses at this point! Cut myself on chainrings so many times I don't even feel it anymore, just notice the blood on the components.

Character 1 [en]: That's [cheerful] kind of hardcore actually!

Character 2 [en]: It's not [apologetic] glamorous or anything, just years of small injuries adding up—broken fingers from wrenches slipping, burns from welding, cuts from cables, all part of the territory really.

Character 1 [en]: But you're [happy] still here, still working.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I'm still [slowly] here, still turning wrenches, still coming home smelling like chain lube and degreaser, still waking up at five-thirty with hands too stiff to make coffee properly.

Character 1 [en]: Sounds, well, exhausting, really, like, how do you, actually, keep going every day?

Character 2 [en]: Coffee, ibuprofen, and stubbornness mostly, but err, also because every bike that rolls out of here, you know, is someone's freedom, their transportation, basically their joy—that matters even when everything hurts.

Character 1 [en]: Do you, hmm, regret choosing this, I mean, this life, sort of?

Character 2 [en]: Some mornings when I can barely straighten my fingers, yeah, but then I get under a bike and everything makes sense again—these machines need someone who understands them, and that someone happens to be me.
