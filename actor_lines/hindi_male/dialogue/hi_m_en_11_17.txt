Character 1 [en]: [sad] Is this seat taken? I haven't been here in about ten years.

Character 2 [en]: No, please, sit. Ten years is a long time to be away. I'm guessing something pretty significant brought you back through those doors today.

Character 1 [en]: [very meekly] My daughter. She died last month. Car accident.

Character 2 [en]: Jesus. I'm so sorry. Look, I know I'm a stranger, but I've been sitting in these pews through my own losses. If you need someone to just be here with you, I'm not going anywhere.

Character 1 [en]: You don't look like you belong here either. The tattoos, the nose ring?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I'm not exactly the traditional churchgoer aesthetic. But this place has changed a lot—they care more about showing up than showing off. Pastor Kim says God's more interested in our hearts than our hardware.

Character 1 [en]: Pastor Kim? What happened to Father Michael?

Character 2 [en]: He retired about six years back. Kim took over and honestly, she transformed this place. Less judgment, more genuine community. She has this gift for making broken people feel whole enough to keep trying.

Character 1 [en]: A female pastor. Things really have changed.

Character 2 [en]: The changes run deeper than that. There's a coffee bar downstairs, youth group does slam poetry on Wednesdays, and they turned the old confession booth into a meditation space. It's become a place where questions matter more than having all the answers.

Character 1 [en]: My daughter would have loved that. She wrote poetry.

Character 2 [en]: She sounds like she had a beautiful soul. They have this memorial wall where people share art and writing from loved ones who've passed. When you're ready—and only when you're ready—her words could touch other people going through their own darkness.

Character 1 [en]: I can't even read her poems yet. I tried yesterday and I just couldn't.

Character 2 [en]: Of course you can't. Grief doesn't operate on anyone's schedule. It took me two years before I could touch my brother's things without completely falling apart. Some days I still can't. That's not weakness—it's love with nowhere to go.

Character 1 [en]: Your brother collected comics? My daughter did too. Marvel or DC?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, he was an indie purist through and through. Said the mainstream stuff was too sanitized, too safe. He'd spend hours in these tiny comic shops hunting for publishers nobody'd heard of. Called it "finding art in the margins."

Character 1 [en]: Sophie felt the same way. Said Marvel was too corporate.

Character 2 [en]: Sophie—that's a beautiful name. Listen, there's a grief support group that meets here Thursdays at seven. It's not preachy, just people who understand what it's like to have a person-shaped hole in their world. No pressure, but the option's there.

Character 1 [en]: [extremely happy] I should go, service is starting. I didn't mean to dump all this on a stranger.

Character 2 [en]: We're not strangers anymore. I'm Jamie. Same seat, same time next week if you want someone who gets it. And for what it's worth, Sophie raised a parent brave enough to walk back into a church after ten years—that says something about both of you.
