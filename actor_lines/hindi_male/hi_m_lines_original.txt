Customer: Um, so my account got... I got hacked. I guess. So.
1. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, um, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, we're going to get this completely sorted out for you, okay? I'm going to make sure we get you protected going forward too.
Customer: Yeah okay okay. Um, I just... I just need to get back in.
2. Absolutely, so, um, I think what we'll do first is, uh, let me see here... I'm generating a temporary access code TAC-9847-VN22 that I'll, um, send to your registered email. But actually, wait, is your email still secure?
Customer: Hmm, what if... what if they changed that too?
3. That's, um, that's actually a really good question, and I'm glad you're thinking about this. So let me, uh, verify your identity first with security question set SQ-4419-B, and then, hmm, I'm going to walk you through checking everything, sort of step by step, to make sure nothing else got compromised, okay?
Customer: Let me see here... um, are you sure this will work?
4. I understand you're worried, and, um, honestly that's totally normal in this situation. But yes, I've, uh, I've helped probably hundreds of customers through this exact process, and we're going to get your account back today, I promise.
Customer: Okay okay okay. Just... just tell me what I need to do.
5. Perfect, so, um, first I need to ask you the security question on file here, which is, uh, "What was your first pet's name?" And then, hmm, once we verify that, I'll send recovery code REC-77852-XK to your phone.
Customer: Um, it's it's Whiskers. The pet. Whiskers.
6. Got it.
Customer: So that means... hmm, that means you can fix it?
7. Yes, absolutely, so, um, I'm sending that recovery code now to your phone ending in 4782, and, uh, while you're waiting for that, let me just, hmm, let me set up some extra protections here. I'm going to enable, um, two-factor authentication with code 2FA-8829-QM so this won't happen again.
Customer: Um, okay I got I got the code. Now what?
8. Perfect! So, uh, go ahead and read me that code, and then, hmm, I think what we should do is, um, immediately change your password and, uh, review all your recent account activity to see if they did anything else.
Customer: It's um... let me see here... 5-5-9-3-7-2.
9. Okay great, so I've, um, I've just reset your access with confirmation number CNF-10934-RT88, and, uh, you should be getting an email right now with a link to create your new password. But, hmm, I want to make sure you use something really strong this time, okay?
Customer: Are you sure they can't just... just hack it again?
10. So that's, um, that's exactly why I've added all these extra security layers, including, uh, login alerts with tracking ID TRK-6621-LP, and, hmm, I've also flagged your account for our security team to monitor for the next 30 days. You're going to be really well protected now, I promise. Nobody's getting back in there.
Customer: Look, I need to... what's the word... resolve something with my account quickly.
11. Oh, oh absolutely! Um, let me just—just pull up your account here, and uh, I'll need your account number, or or if you have your email that's—that's totally fine too, whatever's easier for you!
Customer: Um, it's... uh... j.martinez at, um, techflow dot com.
12. Perfect perfect, okay so I've got you here, um, account number ACC-7749-QM22, and uh, I can see you've been with us for—oh wow—for four years! That's that's wonderful! So um, what can I help you with today?
Customer: Yeah, four years. Never had issues before. But my... my service isn't working properly.
13. Oh no, I'm I'm so sorry to hear that! Let me just, um, check the service status for account ACC-7749-QM22 here, and uh, I can see—wait, sorry, let me refresh—okay so um, there's no outages in your area, so let's let's figure out what's happening together, okay?
Customer: It's probably... look, I might've... changed something in the settings.
14. Oh that's—that's totally fine! Um, happens all the time actually, and uh, let me just pull up your configuration panel here for device ID DEV-3381-XX9, and um, we'll we'll get this sorted out super quick, no worries at all!
Customer: I've been a customer for four years. This is... embarrassing.
15. Oh gosh, no no no, please don't—don't feel that way! Um, honestly? I had a customer yesterday, been with us for ten years, and uh, same exact thing! So let me just, um, run a quick diagnostic scan DSC-449207, and and we'll see what's what's going on here.
Customer: Can we just... fix it? I don't need the whole... investigation.
16. Of course of course! Um, so I'm I'm seeing here that your DNS settings were—oh wait, that's the—sorry, I mean your network preferences were modified on, um, let me see... timestamp shows TSP-201124-0932, which was yesterday morning?
Customer: Um, yeah... that's... uh, that sounds about right. Yesterday.
17. Totally totally fine! So um, what I'm gonna do is just—just reset those to default, and uh, your confirmation code for this fix is gonna be FIX-8827-RD41, and and everything should be back to normal in about, um, two minutes?
Customer: Two minutes? That's it? After I spent an hour trying to... whatever.
18. I know I know, it's it's frustrating! But um, honestly you did the right thing calling us, and uh, I've added a note to your account NTE-5509-K that you're one of our valued long-term customers, so so next time just reference that and we'll prioritize you!
Customer: Uh, well... I mean... is it working now?
19. Let me just—just double check here, um, running verification VRF-229847 and... yes yes yes! It's all all green lights! Your service is is fully restored, and um, I've also credited your account $15 for the inconvenience, credit ID CRD-1165-ZM.
Customer: Oh. You didn't have to... I mean, it was my fault.
20. No no, that's—that's what we're here for! Um, and between you and me? After four years with us, you you definitely deserve it. Is there, uh, anything else I can help with today, or or are we all set?
Customer: Wait. So they're... what's it called... disputing? After I groomed the dog?
21. Yes, um, so basically what I'm seeing here is, uh, there's a dispute on transaction TXN-8847-QV2 from last Tuesday, and um, they're claiming the services weren't, like, completed as described.
Customer: Not completed? I did... I groomed. The whole dog. Tuesday right?
22. So, uh, actually it was Thursday, looking at the timestamp here, but um, basically what happens with disputes is, like, the customer can file within sixty days and we have to, you know, investigate.
Customer: Thursday. Right. Sorry. But I... what's the word... finished? Everything?
23. I understand. Let me just. Pull up. The specifics here on case number CSE-3921-NK8. So they're stating the, um, the grooming wasn't what they requested.
Customer: Um, but I did the... er... standard cut? Or wait. Was it... no, special trim?
24. Right so, um, according to the notes in transaction TXN-8847-QV2, it was, uh, supposed to be a breed-specific cut, and they're saying, um, that's not what was delivered.
Customer: Breed specific. That's. I definitely... wait. Did I write that down wrong?
25. So like, here's the thing, um, and I actually used to work at a pet store so, uh, I get how frustrating this is, but basically we need documentation showing what service was agreed on.
Customer: I'm prob'ly just. Being dumb. But they can't just... take money back? After?
26. No no, you're not being dumb at all, um, it does seem unfair but, uh, with payment processor rules under code PPC-7764, customers have, like, these dispute rights even after services.
Customer: So they get grooming. Free? That's... I don't... how's that work?
27. Well. Not exactly. So um, basically what happens is, er, you can submit evidence for case CSE-3921-NK8 showing, uh, before and after photos, appointment notes, that kind of thing.
Customer: Evidence. Right. Um, I might've... er... deleted those? Sorry. I'm terrible with... keeping things.
28. Okay so, um, listen, between you and me? I've seen groomers win these disputes, like, seventy percent of the time when they submit, uh, even just basic documentation.
Customer: Seventy? That's... wait. Did you say sixty? I already forgot.
29. Seventy, yeah. So um, for your case CSE-3921-NK8, even if you just, like, write up what you remember about the appointment and, uh, maybe check if you have any texts with the customer?
Customer: Texts. Right. Right. I prob'ly... messed something up though. Usually do.
30. So, um, honestly you're being way too hard on yourself, like, disputes happen to everyone and, uh, just submit whatever you have by Friday using reference RES-5502-AAQ and we'll fight this for you.
Customer: Um, hi, so like, I'm calling 'cause, uh, basically my account keeps showing these, what's the word... tax classification errors and, um, I run a distillery so, uh, it's really important we get this right.
31. Oh no, okay, let me—wait, I'm pulling up your account here—what's your account number? Actually no, give me your business name first and I'll find it that way.
Customer: Yeah it's, um, Blue Ridge Spirits, and like, I really appreciate you, uh, helping with this.
32. Got it, Blue Ridge Spirits, I see you here, account BRS-4421-TX, and oh wow, I'm seeing multiple tax classification issues going back to—no wait, these are from just this month alone. Listen, we're absolutely going to fix this for you today.
Customer: Oh thank God, 'cause, um, so basically every time I think it's fixed, like, it just... [sharp inhale] ...happens again and, uh, you know?
33. Right right, so I'm looking at your classification code here, it's showing SIC-2085 but then it's also got—hmm, that's weird—it's also pulling NAICS-312140 which is, uh, for distilleries, but then there's this third code that shouldn't even be there.
Customer: Exactly! And, um, I know this isn't your fault, like, the system just keeps, uh, adding that wrong code back.
34. No no no, this is definitely our system's fault, and I'm seeing here in the notes that agent, um, let me see—agent TK-8827 tried to fix this last Tuesday—no sorry, Wednesday—but clearly it didn't stick. I'm escalating this right now to our tax team.
Customer: You're, uh, you're really going above and, um, beyond here, seriously, thank you so much.
35. Listen, um, I actually used to work at a, uh, at a brewery before this job, so I know how important getting these classifications right is for TTB compliance and everything. Your case number is gonna be CSE-99234-DIST and I'm personally gonna monitor this.
Customer: Wait, really? That's, um, that's amazing, so you actually, like, get what we're dealing with here.
36. Absolutely, and here's what we're gonna do—I'm putting a permanent override code, POC-8823-LOCK, on your account that should prevent the system from auto-changing your classification anymore.
Customer: Um, okay so, like, will that actually stick this time? 'Cause, uh, I don't mean to be... [exhale] ...but we've tried fixes before.
37. Yeah no, I totally get your concern, um, but this override is different—it's at the, uh, what we call the root level? So basically even if the regular system tries to change it during our monthly updates, this code POC-8823-LOCK will block it.
Customer: Oh man, um, I just... thank you, like, seriously, you have no idea how much, uh, stress this has been causing.
38. Of course, of course, and actually, um, because of all the hassle you've been through, I'm also adding a credit to your account—let me just—okay, credit ref CRD-4456-COMP for three months of service, should show up within 24 hours.
Customer: What? No, you don't have to—I mean, um, that's so, like, generous but, uh, I'm just happy to get it fixed!
39. No really, you deserve it after dealing with this mess. So your ticket CSE-99234-DIST is now with our tier-two tax team, and, um, I'm setting a personal reminder to check back on this—actually no, I'm gonna give you my direct extension.
Customer: You're, um, you're actually the best, like, I was so stressed calling in and, uh, you just made my whole week.
40. Aww, hey, that's what I'm here for! My extension is 4429, just ask for Jordan, and if that classification code even thinks about changing again, you call me directly and we'll shut it down immediately, okay?
Customer: Um, so I'm—no wait, I need to, uh, report that my—the driver said he, um, delivered it but there's nothing here.
41. I'm really sorry to hear that's happened, let me pull up your account here... okay so what's the order number you're checking on?
Customer: It's, uh, wait I—no, um, hold on—how do I know you're, uh, actually gonna help? This feels like—I mean, um, are you real support?
42. Yeah so, um, I completely understand your concern, and, hmm, let me see here... I'm with the actual support team, my employee ID is REP-7739-NK if you need that for reference, and, um, I really do want to help track down what happened with your package.
Customer: Says delivered at two-fifteen. Not here. Nothing.
43. Okay so, um, let me check the GPS confirmation on that delivery... hmm, I'm seeing it was marked complete at 2:17 PM with photo confirmation at your address, tracking number TRK-889264-QP21, but, uh, sometimes drivers mark things incorrectly and I really wish I had, um, more control over fixing these situations immediately.
Customer: Photo? What—no there's no, um, I checked everywhere and, uh, this is—wait, um, could someone have, er, stolen it after?
44. That's definitely possible, and I hate that this is even something we have to consider... can you check with neighbors maybe, and I'll file an investigation report INV-2847-XK right now?
Customer: Neighbors? I don't—this is getting worse. What if it's gone forever?
45. So, um, I know this is really stressful, and, uh, honestly I'm limited in what I can do right this second, but, um, the investigation usually takes 24-48 hours and, hmm, in most cases we either locate the package or issue a full refund through case number CSE-9983347-B.
Customer: Twenty-four hours? But I—wait, um, that's not—I need it today! This is, uh, this feels like a scam, how do I, um, even know you'll actually investigate?
46. Right right, I get it.
Customer: But you're just—I mean, um, you're saying words but, uh, nothing's happening! Where's my stuff? Is this, er, even real?
47. I genuinely wish I could instantly solve this for you, but our system requires the investigation process... your case CSE-9983347-B is now active and you'll get email updates every few hours with actual progress reports.
Customer: Every few hours. Great. So I just wait?
48. Um, actually, hmm, let me try something else here... so I'm checking if there's, uh, any way to expedite this, and, um, I can flag it as priority due to the delivery photo not matching your property, reference code PRI-4492-M.
Customer: Not matching? Wait—you can see it's wrong?
49. Looking at the delivery photo in our system, file IMG-78823-KP, it shows a different door color than what's registered for your address, which honestly makes me think the driver went to the wrong house entirely.
Customer: Wrong house? So it's just—um, sitting at someone else's door? This is, uh, I can't—what if they took it inside already?
50. So I'm marking this as misdelivery rather than standard investigation, case type MSD-1147-R, which means we can process a replacement order immediately while we track down the original, and honestly I'm frustrated our drivers don't double-check addresses better.
Customer: Um, hi, I just got my bill and it's, uh, it's three times what it usually... I don't understand what's...
51. Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's—let me just—actually, can I get your account number first? It should be, uh, at the top of your bill, starts with ACC.
Customer: ACC-4982. Look, I'm a single mom, I can't afford this.
52. Okay so, um, I'm pulling up ACC-4982 here and, uh, oh wow, I see what you mean about the increase, that's—I'm really sorry, that must be, um, really stressful.
Customer: Can you just, um, tell me why it's... what's the word... why it jumped like that?
53. Right, so I can see here that your usage for billing period BIL-2024-03 shows 2,847 kilowatt hours which is definitely—I mean, that's significantly higher than your average.
Customer: But we didn't do anything diff— um, I mean, nothing changed, so how is that even...
54. I understand, I really do, and um, sometimes there can be—actually, let me check—okay so I'm seeing meter reading MR-73921-X was done on the 15th, and uh, it looks like they had been estimating your bills before.
Customer: Estimating? So they just, um, guessed wrong and now I'm... of course. Of course this happens.
55. Yeah, um, I know this is—look, I'm really sorry about this, but basically when they do actual readings after estimates, sometimes there's a, uh, catch-up adjustment in billing cycle CYC-4982-Q3.
Customer: A catch-up? That's just... fantastic. Really great.
56. I can hear how frustrated you are and, um, honestly? I think it's—I mean, the system shouldn't work this way, it's not fair to customers, especially when you're budgeting and then suddenly get hit with adjustment ADJ-9982-7.
Customer: Um, so what am I supposed to, uh, actually do here? I literally can't pay this.
57. Okay, so—and I really want to help you here—um, we have a payment plan option, reference code PAY-PLAN-88K, where we can spread this over, uh, I think up to six months?
Customer: Six months of... and then next month's bill too, so that's, um, that's still...
58. Right right.
Customer: I just, um, don't understand how they can just, uh, estimate wrong and then I'm the one who...
59. No, you're absolutely right, and um, between you and me? I see this happen way too often with meter corrections like COR-4421-B, and I always feel terrible because—I mean, how are people supposed to plan for this?
Customer: Exactly. Um, the payment plan, is there a... what's it... a fee for that?
60. So, um, actually—and this is some good news at least—there's no fee for plan enrollment PLE-7736-X, and uh, I can even backdate it to avoid any late charges, which, um, technically I'm supposed to get supervisor approval for but honestly, given what happened here with the estimates...
Customer: Hi, um, I'm calling about. A charge. On my card? I've never even—I don't know this store.
61. Okay, so let me pull up your account here. Can you give me the last four digits of the card and, um, also the charge amount you're seeing?
Customer: It's 4-8-9-2. Um, and it's like. Two hundred forty dollars? From someplace called... Luxe Boutique?
62. Right, so I'm seeing that charge here, transaction ID TXN-88934-LB24, posted yesterday at 3:47 PM. Let me just... what's the word... investigate this a bit deeper for you.
Customer: Yesterday? But I was at work! I mean, I never—um, what if someone stole my—oh god, what if there's more charges?
63. So, um, I'm checking your recent activity now, and uh, this Luxe Boutique charge is, hmm, actually the only unusual one I'm seeing in the past week, reference number REF-2024-78432.
Customer: Only one? So far. But like. What if they're, I don't know, planning something bigger?
64. I understand your concern, I really do. So basically what I can do right now is, um, freeze this card immediately, dispute code DSP-90124-A, and we'll overnight you a replacement.
Customer: Um, yes, please, like right now? Can you—I mean—will I get my money back though?
65. Yeah, so with fraud claims like this, case number FRD-55891-CC, you're looking at probably 5 to 7 business days for the provisional credit, and then we investigate on our end.
Customer: Five to seven days? That's. That's rent money. I can't...
66. Hmm, let me, uh, see what else I can... okay so, I'm putting a rush on this, priority code PRI-4421-X, which should get you that credit in, um, maybe 2 to 3 days instead.
Customer: Oh my god, um, really? That would be—I mean, like, you're literally saving me right now.
67. I mean, I wish I could just, you know, make it instant for you, but the system has these... limitations. Your new card, tracking number TRK-90887-EXP, ships tonight though.
Customer: No, no, this is. Amazing. I was so scared that—um, thank you, seriously.
68. So, uh, you'll get an email, confirmation code CNF-22109-B, with all the dispute details and, um, just keep an eye on your account, you know, for anything else unusual.
Customer: I definitely will. Every day. Um, probably every hour actually...
69. That's, er, totally understandable. Your case manager will be Sarah Chen, ID EMP-7734-SC, and she'll probably reach out tomorrow with updates.
Customer: Sarah Chen. Got it. And like, um, thank you again for the rush thing? That was really. Really helpful.
70. Yeah, of course. I mean, I've been there myself, so... anyway, your reference number for this call is, um, CALL-45567-RT, and just call back if anything else pops up, okay?
Customer: Um, hi, I'm—I'm having trouble with the, uh, the payment page. Won't let me update.
71. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that—um, let me just—actually, wait, let me pull up your account first. Can I get your, uh, your email address associated with the account?
Customer: It's it's sarah.chen at, um, writersdesk dot com.
72. Okay so, um, I see your account here—SRH-2847-CN—and, uh, hmm, let me check what's happening with the payment section. I'm really sorry you're dealing with this.
Customer: Yeah, I just—I just need to change cards. Got a new one.
73. Right, right, I totally understand, and um—oh, I think I see—actually no, wait, let me—so there's a verification hold on your account, VRF-88234-P, which is, uh, probably why it's not letting you update the payment method.
Customer: Um, okay okay, so... how do we fix that?
74. So I'm—I'm really sorry about this, but um, basically we need to, uh, verify your identity first? I know it's, like, kind of a hassle and I'm so sorry, but, um, can you confirm the last four digits of the card currently on file?
Customer: Uh, nine nine... four seven.
75. Perfect, okay so that matches—um, let me just—hmm, I'm going to, uh, manually override this hold for you. The system is being, sort of, overly cautious I think. Just, um, give me one second here while I process override code OVR-5521-MX.
Customer: That's—that's really helpful. Thank you.
76. Of course! I mean, um, I feel terrible that you even had to call about this. It should just, you know, work. Okay so, uh, I've cleared the hold and—actually let me double-check—yes, you should be able to update your payment now.
Customer: Um, let me—let me try right now. While you're there.
77. Absolutely, take your time. I'll, uh, I'll stay on while you do that.
Customer: Oh! It's it's working. Finally.
78. Oh good! I'm so—um, that's such a relief. And, uh, I can see on my end that your new card ending in, hmm, 2891 has been successfully added to account SRH-2847-CN.
Customer: You've been, um, really really great about this. Seriously.
79. That's so kind of you to say—I mean, um, I'm just sorry you had to deal with this at all. Is there, uh, anything else I can help you with while I have your account up?
Customer: No no, that's—that's everything. Really appreciate it.
80. Well, um, thank you so much for your patience with this whole thing, and, uh, just so you know, I've added a note to your account—note ID NTE-7739-K—so if you have any other issues, whoever helps you will, um, they'll see what happened today. But hopefully everything should be, you know, smooth from here on out.
Customer: Um, hi, so I'm calling about, uh, getting some documentation that I, er, really need pretty urgently?
81. [HEAVY FILLERS] Oh okay, so, um, let me just pull up your account here and, like, I can definitely help you with that, so basically just give me your account number or, uh, email and I'll, hmm, get right into that for you.
Customer: [HEAVY FILLERS] It's, um, for my OT license renewal? So like, basically I need, uh, my continuing education certificates?
82. Right right, so I totally get that, those audits come up fast and suddenly you need everything yesterday, I see here your account ID ACC-7739-QM2 has fourteen completed courses but looks like the certificates never got sent out properly.
Customer: [HEAVY FILLERS] Fourteen? Um, wait, that's, uh, that's actually really good news, so they're all, er, completed?
83. [HEAVY FILLERS] Yeah so, um, honestly? This happens, like, way more than it should, basically our system, uh, sometimes just doesn't trigger the automatic certificate emails, which I think is, hmm, pretty ridiculous for a continuing ed platform, you know?
Customer: When can you send them? The audit deadline is Thursday.
84. [HEAVY FILLERS] So, um, here's what I'm gonna do, and like, between you and me? I'm sort of supposed to put in a ticket that takes 3-5 business days but, uh, that's obviously not gonna work for you, so basically I'm just going to, hmm, manually push all fourteen through right now.
Customer: [HEAVY FILLERS] Oh um, really? That's, uh, that would be amazing, I was so, er, worried about this.
85. Absolutely, I mean look, I had my nursing license audit last year and they gave me literally four days notice, so I completely understand the panic, okay so I'm seeing certificates for courses EDU-8847-A through EDU-8860-N all generating now in the system.
Customer: [HEAVY FILLERS] Um, will they, like, have the right dates on them? Because, uh, the board is really, er, particular about that.
86. [HEAVY FILLERS] Oh yeah, so, um, they'll all show the original completion dates, not today's date, so like basically you're good there, and uh, I'm also gonna send you, hmm, a consolidated transcript with reference number TRN-5543-BK9 just in case they want, you know, everything in one document.
Customer: This is actually going way better than I expected, honestly.
87. [HEAVY FILLERS] Right? So, um, I probably shouldn't say this but like, our certificate system is, uh, kind of a disaster and basically I spend half my day just, hmm, manually fixing what should be automatic, but at least I can actually fix it, you know?
Customer: [HEAVY FILLERS] Um, so how long until I, er, actually get these? Like, uh, in my email?
88. So you should see them hitting your inbox in probably the next five to ten minutes, I'm showing your email on file ends in ptservices.com and I've got confirmation codes generating now, CRT-9901 through CRT-9914, and honestly if they're not there in fifteen minutes just call back and ask for me, I'm Jordan.
Customer: [HEAVY FILLERS] Jordan, um, you're literally, like, saving my career right now, I just, uh, thank you so much.
89. [HEAVY FILLERS] Oh my gosh, so, um, you're totally welcome, and like, honestly? After going through my own audit nightmare I basically made it my mission to, uh, make sure nobody else has to stress like I did, so I think you're all set but, hmm, definitely check that all fourteen certificates come through.
Customer: I'll check right now. Actually—wait, I see one already!
90. Perfect! Yeah so they're flowing through the system now, and I put a note on your account with ticket number TKT-4429-RX that these were urgent for licensing, just in case you need to reference anything later or heaven forbid something goes wrong, but I think you should be totally good for Thursday.
Customer: Oh thank god. Um. Finally. I've been—I've been trying for like. Two hours. The site just keeps. Um. Crashing.
91. Oh yeah, so, um, I totally get it—we've been having, uh, major issues all morning and honestly? Like between you and me, I've been getting calls nonstop about this, so, um, you're definitely not alone here.
Customer: I thought I was. Doing something wrong? Like maybe my—my computer was...
92. No no no, absolutely not your fault—so basically our main server cluster, uh, decided to just completely melt down around 8 AM, and we've been, hmm, scrambling ever since.
Customer: So um. I just need. To pay my bill? It's it's due today. And I can't—I can't get another late fee.
93. Right, so, um, let me just, uh, pull up your account directly here and we'll just, you know, bypass the whole website thing—can I get your account number or, um, phone number on file?
Customer: It's uh. 555. Wait. 555-0147.
94. Perfect, okay so I'm seeing here... hmm, let me just... okay your account ID is ACC-7739-BN21 and yeah, I can definitely help you with that payment right now.
Customer: Really? Oh god. Thank you. Thank you thank you.
95. Of course! So, um, I'm actually gonna, uh, waive that late fee too since, like, you literally couldn't pay because of our mess—showing as, hmm, $127.43 due?
Customer: Yes yes yes. That's. That's right. Sorry I'm just so um. Relieved?
96. Hey no, I mean, I totally understand—I actually had a customer earlier literally crying because they thought their service would get shut off, so, uh, you're handling this pretty well honestly.
Customer: I was. Getting there. The crying I mean. So um. How do we...?
97. So, um, I can just take the payment right over the phone here, and uh, I'll email you confirmation number and everything—you want to use the card on file ending in, let me see... 4829?
Customer: Um actually no. Can I? Different card?
98. Yeah absolutely, whenever you're ready just go ahead with the number.
Customer: Okay okay. It's um. 4532. No wait. 4523...
99. 4523, mm-hmm, and then the rest whenever you're, uh, ready—no rush, I know it's been a morning.
Customer: Sorry sorry. Let me. Start over? I'm probably—probably being so annoying.
100. Oh my god no, you're like, seriously one of the nicest calls today—someone literally screamed at me about the website for ten minutes earlier, so, um, you're totally fine, just take your time with those numbers.
Customer: Of course I can't figure this out, um, look I'm just trying to... the claim form doesn't make any sense...
101. Oh hey no worries at all, so um, let me just, uh, pull up your file here real quick and basically we're gonna get this sorted, what's your claim number?
Customer: Um, uh, I think it's... CL-4429 or maybe... I don't know, I'm probably reading it wrong...
102. CL-4429, got it, perfect perfect, so like between you and me? These forms are basically designed by lawyers who've never actually had to fill one out themselves.
Customer: Yeah well I work construction not... paperwork, so...
103. Right right, so um, here's what we're gonna do, uh, I'm looking at your form now and basically the tricky part is just section three, everything else you've got spot on.
Customer: Section three is the one about... I mean I don't even know what "proximate cause" means...
104. So um, okay okay, uh, proximate cause is just fancy talk for like "what actually broke," so in your case with the, hmm, water damage claim WD-7792-XK, you just put "pipe burst."
Customer: That's it? Just... pipe burst? Why don't they just say that then instead of...
105. Um, exactly exactly, so like, uh, here's the insider trick, whenever they use big words just think "what would I tell my buddy at the bar" and um, that's basically your answer.
Customer: Um, uh, okay but then there's this whole thing about, er, "itemized losses" and I just... of course I don't have receipts from five years ago...
106. Oh oh oh, so between you and me? Put "see attached contractor estimate" and um, I'll mark your account EST-9906-APPROVED so like, uh, they won't even ask for receipts.
Customer: Wait you can just... do that?
107. So um, technically I'm using override code OVR-445-X which is for, uh, "special circumstances" but like, your job involves actual work not filing paperwork so, yeah, we're doing it.
Customer: I mean, um, I should probably know this stuff, it's just... every box leads to another box and then...
108. No no no, so like, uh, even I need the manual half the time and um, this is literally my job, so don't even worry bout it.
Customer: Um, er, there's also this part about "subrogation rights" which sounds like... I don't know, something medical...
109. So basically, um, subrogation just means like, uh, "can we sue someone else for this," so if it's just wear and tear or weather, you check "no" on form section SUB-412-B.
Customer: Of course they make it sound scarier than... alright, no on that one then...
110. Perfect perfect, so um, once you send that back with reference number REF-8823-CLAIM, uh, you're all set and like, next time? Just call me direct at ext 7794, skip the whole menu thing.
Customer: Um, hello? Can you—can you hear me? I'm, uh, I'm out here at the corner and the trucks are just, hmm, they're so loud today.
111. Oh absolutely, I can hear you just fine! So um, let me just, uh, turn up my volume here on my end too, and, hmm, how can I help you today? I see your account number is ACC-4892-BK and you've been with us for, oh wow, twelve years!
Customer: Twelve years! Yes yes yes. Let me see here... I need—SORRY, bus just went by—I need help with my bill.
112. Of course, of course! So I'm pulling up your billing history right now, account ACC-4892-BK, and um, I can see your last payment was, uh, let me just... it was on the fifteenth. Is there something specific about the bill that's, um, concerning you?
Customer: It's it's double. Twice what I pay. Every month, same amount, then boom. Let me see here... hundred forty-two dollars.
113. Oh my, that is quite a jump! So, um, I'm looking at your statement here, reference number REF-7739-QZ, and I can actually see what happened. There's a, uh, what's the word... an adjustment from last month that got applied incorrectly.
Customer: Wait wait wait. Can't hear. Fire truck. Okay okay okay, adjustment?
114. Yes! So basically um, what happened is like, there was a credit that should have been applied to your account last month, credit number CRD-8823-LP for $71, but it, uh, somehow got reversed instead of applied, which is why your bill doubled.
Customer: Oh! Oh that's—I just, I just knew somethin' wasn't right. You know? After twelve years, I know my bill.
115. You absolutely do, and you were completely right to call! So, um, I'm going to fix this right now for you. Let me just, uh, process this correction here... okay so I'm applying credit CRD-8823-LP back to your account, and then, hmm, I'm also adding an additional courtesy credit for the confusion.
Customer: You're you're so kind. Hmm, what if... will this happen again? I mean, I can't always call. School hours.
116. Oh, you work at a school! That's wonderful. And no no no, this absolutely won't happen again. I'm, um, putting a note here, note ID NTE-5540-RT, that flags your account for manual review, so basically like, a real person will check your bill every month before it goes out.
Customer: A real person! Oh! Oh that's that's wonderful. Let me see here... so next month, back to normal?
117. Exactly! Back to your regular amount. So your adjusted balance is showing as, um, let me make sure this is right... $71.00 even, and your next regular bill will be issued on, uh, the first as usual.
Customer: Seventy-one. Good good good. SORRY! Ambulance. This corner, always always somethin'.
118. Oh my goodness, sounds like you're at quite the busy intersection! You know what? Um, since you're out there keeping everyone safe, let me also, uh, add our senior safety discount to your account—that's another 15% off starting next month, discount code DSC-9921-SR.
Customer: You don't—I mean I—hmm, that's so... I just just needed the bill fixed! But thank you thank you thank you!
119. So um, you absolutely deserve it! Anyone who's out there, you know, keeping kids safe deserves, uh, all the breaks we can give. Your new confirmation number for everything we did today is CNF-4455-WX, and I'm, um, also sending a text summary to your phone.
Customer: Text! Good. I can—I can read it quiet. At home. You've been... Let me see here... perfect. Just perfect.
120. Aww, well thank you so much! And um, if you ever need anything else, just call back and, uh, reference case number CSE-7710-MN and they'll see all the notes I've made. Stay safe out there at your corner, and um, thank you for what you do!
Customer: Um, hi, I'm probably calling the wrong department but uh, my merchant account is is showing the wrong category and um, I don't know how to... it's kind of complicated?
121. No no, you're in the right place. Let me just... what's the... pull up your account here. Can I get your merchant ID? Should be like MID- and then some numbers.
Customer: Oh um, yeah it's uh, sorry I should have that ready, I'm so stupid, um um MID-447293, I think?
122. Perfect, got it. MID-447293. So I'm seeing you're... hmm... classified as "retail general merchandise" with code MCC-5399. That's not... that's not right?
Customer: No no no, see that's the thing, um, I sell honey but but also like, uh, I rent out bees? For pollination? And um, I don't know if that makes me agriculture or or retail or...
123. Oh wow. Bees. That's... I mean that's actually really cool. So you're like a... what's the word... apiarist? My grandfather kept bees. Let me check our classification guide SOP-2847-B here.
Customer: Really? Your grandfather? Um yeah, apiarist, beekeeper, um, it's just nobody knows what category to put me in and uh, the payment processor keeps flagging my transactions as weird.
124. Ummm, yeah so, this is... this is ridiculous actually. Our system has, uh, seventeen categories for restaurants but nothing for... hmm... beekeeping services. I'm looking at form FRM-8823 and it's just... not there.
Customer: Right right, exactly, um, and and when farmers pay me for pollination services it's like, uh, thousands of dollars at once and then the the system thinks I'm doing something suspicious or or whatever...
125. Oh I totally get it. That must be so... frustrating. Let me... hmm... try code MCC-0761 for agricultural services? No wait, that's for... that's for crop prep. This is honestly embarrassing how limited these are.
Customer: Um, see and then there's the the problem where I also sell like, uh, beeswax candles and and lip balm at farmers markets? So it's it's multiple things?
126. Okay so, um, you're basically running like... what's the... three different business types under one account. REF-9982-XK shows we need to... hmm... maybe split this? Or create a custom classification?
Customer: I mean, um, if that's possible? I just, uh, I feel so dumb not knowing what to call myself, business-wise, you know?
127. No no no, don't... you're not dumb at all. This is our system being... it's stupid, honestly. Like, bees have been around forever and we can't... we can't even classify them properly.
Customer: Um, yeah, and and the bank keeps asking me why I have "seasonal spikes" but like, uh, bees don't work in winter, so...
128. Right? Of course they don't. Okay so, ummm, I'm gonna... I'm filing a manual override request MAN-4429-QZ to create a, uh, what's it... hybrid classification. Agricultural services primary, retail secondary.
Customer: Oh wow, um, that would be that would be amazing, actually, I've been dealing with this for for months and nobody could figure it out...
129. Should've been fixed... months ago. That's ridiculous. Your case number is CSE-889271-P and honestly? I'm gonna escalate this because... beekeepers shouldn't have to explain that bees are... seasonal.
Customer: You're you're being so helpful, um, I really appreciate it, uh, sorry for taking up so much time with my weird bee business stuff...
130. Stop apologizing! It's not weird, it's... it's important. Food supply depends on... on pollinators. Update should process in 24-48 hours under ticket TKT-3928-MN. Keep doing what you're doing.
Customer: So I, um, I think maybe there's been some sort of... I couldn't get through the menu? Like, probably my paycheck didn't?
131. Okay okay, um, I can definitely help you with that, so let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can you give me your employee ID or, um, the last four digits of your social?
Customer: Wait, so basically I kept pressing like... the options weren't... I think it's supposed to be, um, direct deposit?
132. Right right, I understand, those menus can be, um, really confusing sometimes. So, uh, let me just—just need that employee ID first, and then we can, um, check on your payment status in system PAY-7782-Q.
Customer: I don't... maybe it's, um, 4-4-2... no wait, so that's probably my route number. Sorry, I'm kind of...
133. That's totally fine, take your time. Um, so while you're looking, let me explain—the automated system, uh, it routes to different departments based on, um, what you select, and sometimes payroll is under option 3, then option 2, then option 5.
Customer: Oh! So basically I think I was pressing, like, HR instead? Um, my ID is probably... it's E-8-8-3-9?
134. Perfect, E8839, let me just, um, look that up here... okay okay, so I'm seeing your profile in, uh, database EMP-2847-K and, hmm, yeah I can see your last payment was scheduled for, um, October 15th.
Customer: But that's... so like, I didn't get it though? And basically my rent is, um, tomorrow and I'm sort of...
135. I—I completely understand why you're worried, um, so let me dig deeper here. I'm checking transaction log TXN-90234-PPR and, uh, it shows the payment was initiated but, um, there's a flag here...
Customer: A flag? What kind of... I mean, maybe did I fill something wrong? Or like...
136. Um, so basically what happened is, uh, your direct deposit form from, hmm, September 28th, reference number REF-5571-DD, it's—it's missing the routing number verification. Did you recently change banks or, um, update your account?
Customer: Oh! Yeah, so I think... wait, I gave that to, um, to someone in the office?
137. Okay so, um, here's what we can do. I can—I can process an emergency check right now with code EMG-4429-X, and, uh, you'd be able to pick it up at the district office, um, within two hours.
Customer: Really? That's... so like, you can actually do that? I mean, I was kind of thinking nobody would...
138. Absolutely, yeah, I'm—I'm already starting that process. Um, so confirmation number CNF-8892-J, and, uh, while we're at it, let me help you fix the direct deposit so this doesn't, um, happen again.
Customer: That's so... I mean, thank you. Like, really. So basically where exactly do I, um, pick it up?
139. The district office at, uh, 1450 School Drive, just go to window B and give them that confirmation number CNF-8892-J. And, um, for the direct deposit, I'm sending form FRM-3347-A to your email right now.
Customer: You're sort of... I mean, this is like, way better than I thought. I was probably panicking for nothing.
140. No no no, um, you had every right to be concerned! Missing pay is, uh, really stressful. Just make sure to, um, get that form back to us within five days, and your next check on, uh, October 30th will go through normally.
Customer: So basically my tips are wrong. Again. Like last month.
141. Oh! Um, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—sorry, what's your, um, employee ID? I'm gonna, er, crack this case for you, I love these tip pool puzzles actually...
Customer: It's 4427. They said they fixed it last time.
142. Okay so, um, 4427, perfect! I've got your file here, EMP-4427-BCF, and uh, oh wow, I can see the—wait, no that's—sorry, let me look at the right screen here because, um, there's definitely something weird happening with your tip distributions...
Customer: Hmm, what if... it's the same error? Every time?
143. You know what? Um, I think you're onto something because, uh, like, I'm seeing this pattern where—hold on—your location code LOC-8892-TIP is, um, calculating at 0.75 instead of—oh! OH! I see what happened!
Customer: That's what the last person said though.
144. No no, but um, this is different! So like, they fixed the percentage but, uh, didn't update the—sorry, I mean the pooling start date is still, um, set to January instead of March when you actually started and that's throwing everything off...
Customer: Wait really? So they just... never changed my start date?
145. Exactly! And um, er, the system's been, like, dividing your tips by extra phantom employees basically? So uh, let me just—I need to submit form TIP-ADJUST-3920 and, um, backdate everything to March 15th, is that your correct start date?
Customer: March 12th actually. Can you really fix this?
146. Um, March 12th, got it, so like, yes absolutely! I'm, uh, submitting the adjustment now with reference number REF-2024-83756 and, er, the beautiful thing is, um, once I fix this root issue, it'll never happen again because...well, your start date will finally be right!
Customer: Okay so that means... I'll get the back pay too?
147. Oh yes! Um, so like, the retroactive payment RET-PAY-4427-A will, uh, include everything from March 12th forward, and er, I'm calculating here... looks like roughly, um, hold on... $847.32 in adjustments!
Customer: Oh my god. Actually? That's like... rent money.
148. I know right? And um, it'll process with your next paycheck, so, er, that's December 15th according to your pay schedule PAY-SCH-BIWEEK, and uh, I'm also adding a note here that—sorry, typing while I talk—that this was a system error so...
Customer: You're literally saving me right now. Thank you so much.
149. Um, honestly? This made my day! Like, uh, these tip pool errors are so satisfying to fix because, er, once you find the root cause it all just, um, clicks into place, you know? Your confirmation is CNF-98234-RESOLVED.
Customer: Let me see here... so December 15th for everything?
150. Yes! December 15th for the full, um, retroactive amount plus, uh, going forward your regular tips will be calculated correctly using the proper, er, March 12th start date. And, um, I've saved everything under case number CASE-1205-TIPFIX if you need to reference this later!
Customer: Look. I've been—no wait. Um. My tips. They're wrong. Again.
151. Um okay so uh let me just uh pull up your profile here real quick and um I'll need your employee ID if you uh have that handy?
Customer: It's, uh... what's the... 4-4-7. No. 4-7-7. Sorry. 2-9.
152. Got it got it so that's 477-29 and um I'm seeing here uh your last report was submitted for period ending uh December 15th with a total of uh $347.50 in tips reported is that what we're um looking at?
Customer: No! That's—I mean, sort of? But they took. More. Out.
153. Okay okay um so uh let me dig deeper here and uh I can see transaction TXN-9847-B3 shows uh a withholding of $89.42 but um there's also this other deduction here that's uh kind of unusual...
Customer: Eighty nine? I think it was... probably like... ninety something?
154. Um yeah so uh actually you're right there's uh another line item here for $3.78 that got um coded separately under reference REF-5521-QK and uh that's definitely not supposed to be there so um let me just...
Customer: Wait. You found it? The extra. Thing?
155. Yeah yeah um so basically what happened is uh the system double-processed part of your tip allocation and um it created this duplicate withholding entry DUP-7739-XX that uh shouldn't exist at all so um I can fix this right now.
Customer: I've been. Um. Calling about this. For probably... what's it been... three weeks?
156. Oh man um I'm so sorry about that and uh looking at your case history CAS-8823-PP I can see uh yeah three calls and um nobody caught this duplicate entry which is uh really frustrating I know.
Customer: So you can. Actually. Fix it? Like right now?
157. Um absolutely yes so uh I'm processing adjustment ADJ-6677-RT right now and uh you'll see that $3.78 credited back plus um we're also gonna add a correction credit of uh $15 for the inconvenience code CRD-9901-ZM.
Customer: Oh. Um. Wow. That's... I mean, that's really... thank you.
158. It's going to be okay now um the credit hits your next check and uh I've also flagged your account with note NTE-4455-JY so um this won't happen again basically the system will skip that duplicate process.
Customer: The fifteen? That's—you didn't have to. I mean. Thank you. Really.
159. Um of course of course and uh just so you know going forward if you see anything weird with tips just uh reference this ticket TKT-2234-BB and um we'll know exactly what to look for.
Customer: Um, this is like... you actually listened. And found it. Nobody else, uh... sort of... bothered.
160. Hey um I get it I really do and uh tip reporting is confusing enough without the system messing up so um yeah just keep that confirmation CON-8856-AA and uh you should see everything fixed by Thursday latest.
Customer: Look, I need to—actually wait—I just need straight answers about, um, leasing equipment for my gym.
161. Oh absolutely, I completely understand the frustration with getting clear information about equipment leasing, so um, let me pull up our strength training lease options here, your reference number will be LEF-9042-ST and I can, uh, walk you through everything step by step because I know how overwhelming this can be when you're trying to run a business...
Customer: Um, so like—no, hold on—what's the actual, uh, monthly cost here?
162. Right right, so for our standard package STD-4499-A, you're looking at, um, anywhere from like $1,200 to $3,500 monthly depending on what equipment you need, and I know that's a big range but, uh, let me actually... what's the word... customize this for you because between you and me, there's ways to get better rates if you know what to ask for...
Customer: How do I—wait—how do I know this isn't, um, some kind of scam?
163. Got it, totally fair question, so um, we're actually certified through the National Fitness Finance Board with certification number NFFB-77823-C, and uh, I can send you all our documentation right now to your email, but honestly I get why you're asking because there's so many sketchy companies out there and it's like... you just want to train people, not deal with financial nonsense, right?
Customer: I mean, um, yeah but—no actually—what happens if, uh, equipment breaks?
164. Okay okay.
Customer: Because I've been—wait, um, I've been burned before with, uh, maintenance fees and stuff.
165. Oh man, I hear you, so um, with our protection plan PPL-5560-X, all maintenance is completely covered, no hidden fees, and uh, here's the thing... what I usually tell people is... sorry, let me find the right way to explain this... basically if anything breaks we replace it within 48 hours, and between you and me, I've seen other companies charge like $500 just to look at broken equipment which is absolutely criminal...
Customer: Um, but like—hold on—there's gotta be, uh, some catch here, right?
166. So honestly, the only real catch, and um, I'm being totally transparent here because I hate when companies hide things, is that with lease agreement LA-8821-M you're locked in for 36 months minimum, but uh, what most people don't realize is that's actually... how do I put this... it's protection for you too because your rates can't increase during that time even if market prices go up...
Customer: I don't—wait, um, can I just, uh, buy instead of lease?
167. Absolutely.
Customer: Because this whole—I mean, um, all these numbers and, uh, contracts are making me nervous.
168. No I totally get that, and um, here's what I can do for you, so if you want to purchase outright with our buyout option BO-4455-K, we can actually, uh, apply up to three months of what you would've paid in lease payments toward the purchase price, which is something we don't really advertise but like... for strength coaches we try to make things work because you guys are the backbone of the fitness industry...
Customer: Um, how fast can—no wait—when would, uh, equipment actually arrive?
169. So delivery timeframe with shipping code SHP-9933-EXPRESS is, um, typically 10 to 14 business days, but uh, between you and me? If you submit application APP-7701-F today before 5PM, I can probably... what's the word I'm looking for... expedite it through our priority channel and get you set up within a week because I know you've got clients waiting...
Customer: This all sounds—I mean, um, it's too good to be, uh, true honestly.
170. Yeah I mean, um, I completely understand that skepticism, and honestly if I were in your position I'd be thinking the same thing, so uh, what I usually suggest is let me send you our verification packet VER-8856-TRUST with like, actual customer testimonials from other strength coaches, their contact info if you want to call them, and um, our Better Business Bureau rating which is A+ by the way, because at the end of the day you need to feel confident about this and I'd rather you take time to verify everything than rush into something you're not comfortable with...
Customer: Um, hi. I'm calling about... hmm, probably the same thing. Again. Reimbursement.
171. Oh, um, let me just—okay so I'm pulling up your account here and, uh, I see... hmm, is this about the continuing education reimbursement from, let me see... September? Account number ACC-7294-NB?
Customer: Yep. September. Still waiting. Of course.
172. I'm so, so sorry about this. Really. I mean, uh, I can see here that you've called, um... three times already? And it's still showing as pending in our system under reference REF-2024-8823. That's just. Not right. At all.
Customer: Hmm, I know it's... I think it's not your fault. Sorry. Just tired.
173. No no, please don't apologize. You have every right to be frustrated. So um, let me, uh, dig deeper here because, hmm, this is for grief counseling certification renewal, right? That's... that's important work. Really important.
Customer: Yeah. Kind of need it. To keep working.
174. Absolutely. Of course you do. Okay so, um, I'm seeing here that, uh, the original submission SUB-4412-QT got stuck in, hmm, what's the word... like a processing loop? Between departments. Which is, um, completely unacceptable.
Customer: Processing loop. Great. So what now?
175. Right. So. Here's what I can do. Um, I'm going to, uh, manually escalate this—like right now—to our finance team with priority code PRI-889-XX. And, hmm, I'm also adding a note about the, uh, the urgency here.
Customer: Um, okay but... hmm, they said that last time too. Maybe different words.
176. I hear you. I really do. The difference is—and I'm, um, looking at the previous notes here—they submitted it as standard processing. I'm using emergency override EO-7721. It's... it's something I technically need approval for. But. This has gone on long enough.
Customer: Oh. Um, I don't want you to... I mean, get in trouble or anything.
177. No no, it's, uh, it's fine. Really. Sometimes we need to, um, hmm, bend the rules a bit? Especially when someone's been waiting since September for money they're owed. That's three months. Three. Months.
Customer: Yeah it's... hmm, sort of affects things. Bills. You know.
178. Of course it does. God, I'm just—I'm really sorry our system failed you like this. Um, so with the emergency code, you should see the reimbursement in, uh, 24 to 48 hours. Not weeks. Hours.
Customer: Um, heard that before but... I think maybe you mean it. Hopefully.
179. I do. I really, really do. And um, here's what else I'm doing—I'm putting my direct extension in the notes. 4-8-8-2. If this isn't resolved by Thursday, you call me. Directly. Not the main line.
Customer: That's... hmm, actually helpful. Thanks. Sorry for being... you know. Bitter.
180. Please. Don't apologize. After what you've been through with us? Being bitter is, um, completely justified. We failed you. But, uh, I promise—confirmation number CNF-9944-RZ—this ends now. Thursday at the latest.
Customer: Um, okay so, uh, this is literally the fifth time I'm calling about this, um, same exact problem...
181. Oh no, um, I am so, so sorry you're dealing with this, I mean, uh, five times is just—that's completely unacceptable, and, um, I can totally understand why you'd be frustrated, let me, uh, pull up your account here with—hmm, what's your account number?
Customer: It's... let me see here... 447829.
182. Okay so, um, I'm seeing account ACC-447829-QV and, uh, oh wow, yeah I can see the, um, the previous calls here, and honestly this is, like, this shouldn't have happened at all.
Customer: Um, yeah exactly, so like, uh, what's the word... it's becoming this, um, recurring nightmare basically.
183. I completely feel your pain here, I really do, and looking at ticket TKT-983344-M, I can see exactly where things went wrong each time.
Customer: Hmm, wait, you can actually see what happened?
184. So basically, um, what I'm noticing is that, uh, each time someone tried to fix this, they were, like, only addressing the surface issue, not the, um, the root cause which is linked to batch code BCH-7721-XX.
Customer: Um, hold on, wait, really? So you're saying, uh, you actually know what's been going wrong?
185. I think, um, I mean probably what happened is the system kept reverting because nobody updated the master record MRC-5589-KL, which kind of controls everything else.
Customer: Wait, seriously? You can fix this?
186. So, um, here's what I'm gonna do, and uh, I'm maybe not supposed to do this but, um, I'm escalating this directly to our, like, senior technical team under priority code PRI-9982-AA.
Customer: Um, okay but like, uh, how do I know this isn't just, um, another runaround?
187. That's totally fair to ask, and I'm giving you confirmation number CNF-445821-QQR right now, which you can use to track this directly.
Customer: Let me see here... you're actually giving me a direct line to someone?
188. Um, yeah so, uh, not only that but I'm, um, crediting your account with, er, six months of service under credit code CRD-1147-ZM because, like, this never should have happened.
Customer: Wait, um, six months? That's, uh... hmm, what's the catch here?
189. No catch at all, I've been here eight years and honestly when I see case number CSE-774400-X with five calls, that's on us, not you.
Customer: Okay so that means... you're really fixing this today?
190. Already processing under transaction TXN-558821-PPK, and you'll get an email confirmation within ten minutes with everything documented.
Customer: Hi, so, um, I've never actually called before and like, I don't really know how to explain this but basically...
191. Oh, um, that's—that's totally fine, uh, absolutely fine. Let me just, er, pull up your account here and, um, we can work through this together, okay? What's, uh, what's your account number or, hmm, or your email address?
Customer: Oh god sorry, yeah, it's like j-smith-47 at gmail.
192. Perfect, perfect. So, um, I've got your account here—JSM-4782-XX—and, uh, I can see, er, let me just look at your recent activity. Um, take your time, okay? There's—there's no rush here at all.
Customer: So basically what happened is, um, I ordered something? And then like, it just... I dunno if I did it wrong or...
193. Okay, um, so I'm seeing, uh, I'm seeing an order here from, er, three days ago—order number ORD-9923-KL77—and, hmm, it looks like it's, um, currently in processing status which is—which is totally normal.
Customer: Wait no, sorry, that's not—I mean like, there should be two? Or maybe I just...
194. Oh! Oh, um, let me—let me check again here. Hmm, so actually, uh, I do see, er, there's another transaction, um, TXN-44829-PPK, but it's, uh, it's showing as incomplete? Is that—is that maybe what you're calling about?
Customer: Yes! So like I tried to buy it twice and, um, I don't know if I got charged twice or...
195. Right, right, okay. Um, so what I'm seeing here is, er, the first attempt—that TXN-44829-PPK—it, uh, it didn't go through completely, so you weren't charged for that one.
Customer: Oh thank god, sorry, I know this isn't like your fault or anything.
196. No no no, um, please don't apologize! This is, uh, this happens all the time and, er, I'm gonna make sure we get this sorted out properly for you, okay? Let me just, hmm, double-check your payment history here.
Customer: So basically can I just, like, ignore that failed one then?
197. Um, yes, exactly. So that incomplete one will, uh, it'll automatically clear from your account in, er, 24 to 48 hours. But, um, I'm gonna put a note here—note ID NTE-7739-QQM—just to, uh, to make sure there's no confusion later.
Customer: Okay so like, the other one's definitely coming though? Sorry, I just really need it by Friday and...
198. Absolutely, um, so your order ORD-9923-KL77 is, uh, it's scheduled for Thursday delivery. But, er, let me—let me just upgrade that to priority for you, just to—just to be safe, okay?
Customer: Wait really? That's so... I mean like thank you, sorry for being such a mess about this.
199. Oh please, um, you're—you're not a mess at all! Er, I've updated it now with tracking TRK-88256-AAL and, um, you'll get a text confirmation in, uh, in about five minutes with all the details.
Customer: This is like, so much better than I expected, honestly thought I'd totally screwed everything up.
200. No no, um, you did—you did everything right! And, er, just so you know for next time, if you ever see that incomplete status again, um, just wait about five minutes before trying again. But, uh, is there—is there anything else I can help you with today?
Character 1: Yeah, I suppose asteroid mining could work eventually, though I'm not really convinced it'll happen as soon as everyone keeps saying it will.
201. Well, um, you're not wrong to be skeptical, honestly, because the technical challenges are, you know, still pretty overwhelming. We're talking about landing on objects moving at thousands of miles per hour, extracting resources in zero gravity, and then somehow getting everything back to Earth without spending more money than the materials are worth.
Character 1: Right, and I keep hearing about these companies claiming they'll be operational in five years, but that seems pretty optimistic to me.
202. Five years is laughably optimistic when you consider that just getting regulatory approval takes at least three years, and that's before anyone builds a single spacecraft. The real timeline is probably closer to fifteen or twenty years for actual commercial operations, and even that assumes everything goes perfectly with the test missions.
Character 1: I mean, sure, there's definitely money to be made if someone figures it out, but it's not exactly keeping me on the edge of my seat.
203. Well, the economics are, kind of, fascinating though, I mean, when you actually dig into them. A single metallic asteroid could contain more platinum than has ever been mined on Earth, which sounds amazing until you realize that flooding the market with that much platinum would crash prices so badly that the whole operation becomes unprofitable.
Character 1: So, err, we'd basically tank the entire precious metals market just by being successful?
204. Exactly, which is why the smart money is actually focusing on water and fuel extraction for use in space rather than bringing metals back to Earth. Water can be split into rocket fuel, and it costs about ten thousand dollars per kilogram to launch from Earth, so mining it in space for refueling stations makes way more economic sense.
Character 1: Hmm, okay, like, I can see how that might work, the thing is though, who's going to pay for all this infrastructure anyway?
205. Governments initially, then private companies once there's proven [smiling speaking] demand, just like how the internet started as a military project. SpaceX and Blue Origin are already planning lunar bases that would need regular water deliveries, and NASA's Artemis program is budgeting billions for in-space resource utilization.
Character 1: I, uhh, I guess that makes [shy] sense, sort of, but it still feels pretty far-fetched to me.
206. Right so, here's what's really happening behind the scenes, er, that most people don't realize - Luxembourg and the UAE have already passed laws giving companies property rights to space resources they extract. They're positioning themselves as the Delaware of space commerce, creating legal frameworks that'll attract billions in investment once the technology catches up.
Character 1: Ah, so it's just that countries are already fighting over who gets to regulate something that doesn't even exist yet, probably typical politics.
207. Politics mixed with venture capital gambling, because these early investors are betting that whoever establishes the first successful mining operation will basically write the rules for everyone else. It's like staking claims during the gold rush, except the mountains are flying through space at seventeen thousand miles per hour.
Character 1: I suppose someone has to be first, though I wouldn't want to be the test pilot for those missions.
208. There won't be any pilots at all, everything will be fully robotic because the radiation exposure alone would kill humans on these long-duration missions. Plus, robots don't need life support, food, or return tickets, which cuts costs by roughly ninety percent compared to crewed missions.
Character 1: Makes sense, though I imagine the software bugs could get pretty expensive when your robot is millions of miles away.
209. The Japanese learned that lesson the hard way when their Nozomi probe's software glitched and they spent five years trying to salvage the mission before giving up. Every line of code has to be perfect because you can't just push an update when the communication delay is forty minutes round trip.
Character 1: Yeah, well, I'll believe it when I see actual asteroids being mined, not just PowerPoint presentations and press releases.
210. Fair enough, though I'm getting [angry] tired of people dismissing this as science fiction when we've literally already brought back asteroid samples. Japan's done it twice, and NASA's OSIRIS-REx just delivered pounds of asteroid material to Earth last year, so the only question is scaling from grams to tons.
Character 1: God, I just saw that CEO compensation report for last year and I nearly threw my phone across the room.
211. Oh yeah, well, those numbers are, you know, absolutely insane when you actually look at them. The average CEO of a Fortune 500 company made three hundred and fifty times what their median worker earned, which is basically saying one day of CEO work equals an entire year for regular employees.
Character 1: Three hundred and fifty times? Jesus, how does anyone even justify that?
212. So the justification they use is, um, that CEOs create shareholder value, but here's the thing, studies show zero correlation between CEO pay and company performance. Most of these boards are just CEOs from other companies approving each other's raises, like, it's literally a closed loop of wealthy people deciding they deserve more wealth.
Character 1: And meanwhile everyone else is struggling to pay rent.
213. Right, I mean, the minimum wage hasn't actually kept up with inflation since 1968, so, you know, people are working harder for less purchasing power than their grandparents had. A full-time minimum wage worker can't afford a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in America, not a single state, which is honestly just broken.
Character 1: It feels like we're heading back to the Gilded Age or [trailing off] something even worse maybe...
214. We've already surpassed Gilded Age inequality by several metrics, er, which is terrifying because, well, that era ended with massive labor strikes and violence. The top one percent now owns more wealth than the entire bottom ninety percent combined, uhh, and that gap keeps growing exponentially every year.
Character 1: What really gets me is how they convince regular people to defend billionaires.
215. The propaganda is incredibly [cough] effective because they've reframed systemic exploitation as individual failure. If you're poor, it's because you didn't work hard enough, not because wages have been deliberately suppressed while productivity has skyrocketed and all those gains went straight to shareholders and executives.
Character 1: My cousin keeps saying he'll be rich someday so we shouldn't tax the wealthy.
216. That's the temporarily embarrassed millionaire syndrome, like, Americans have been basically conditioned to believe they're one lucky break from joining the elite. The statistical reality is, um, that economic mobility in America is lower than in most developed nations, so, your cousin has better odds of being struck by lightning than becoming genuinely wealthy.
Character 1: I guess, well, the whole system is, you know, rigged anyway, isn't it?
217. Rigged is putting it mildly when, uhh, the wealthy literally write the tax code through lobbying, I mean, they've created this maze of loopholes where Amazon pays less in taxes than a school teacher. Warren Buffett himself admits his secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does, which is, honestly, just openly mocking us at this point.
Character 1: So what, er, what are we supposed to do about it, like, vote harder or something?
218. Voting helps but it's not enough when both parties take corporate donations and the Supreme Court decided money equals speech. Real change historically comes from organized labor movements, general strikes, and people literally shutting down the economy until demands are met, which is why they work so hard to keep us divided and arguing about culture war nonsense.
Character 1: Sometimes I wonder if things will just keep getting worse until everything collapses.
219. History shows these levels of inequality are unsustainable and always end badly, either through revolution, war, or economic collapse that wipes out paper wealth. The New Deal only happened because FDR convinced the rich that mild socialism was better than actual socialism, and we might be approaching that same inflection point again.
Character 1: Yeah but this time they have private armies and surveillance tech.
220. Oh sure, the billionaires are [sarcastic] definitely prepared for climate collapse with their bunkers in New Zealand. Nothing says sustainable society like the ultra-wealthy literally planning their escape routes while the planet burns, but I'm sure their private security will remain loyal when money becomes worthless and food runs out.
Character 1: Why do octopuses have three hearts?
221. Oh, well, that's actually, um, a really cool adaptation thing. Two of them pump blood to the gills while, you know, the third one handles circulation to the rest of the body. Pretty efficient system when you think about it.
Character 1: Three hearts. That's [exhausted] excessive.
222. Ha! I mean, when you're living underwater and need to squeeze through tiny spaces, your body needs all the oxygen it can get. Plus they stop using that main heart when they swim, which is why they prefer crawling.
Character 1: They stop their heart to swim?
223. Yeah! Wild, [gasp loudly] right? It's too exhausting for them to keep it pumping while swimming. Makes them vulnerable though, which is probably why you see them scooting along the ocean floor more often than swimming around.
Character 1: What else stops its heart voluntarily?
224. Hmm, not many creatures do that on purpose. Some hibernating animals slow theirs way down, like wood frogs that basically freeze solid in winter. Their hearts completely stop until spring thaw.
Character 1: Frozen frogs. So, uh, they're basically, like, dead then?
225. Kind of, yeah, but um, not really— it's more like, er, suspended animation. Their cells produce this natural antifreeze, glucose and urea, that prevents ice crystals from forming inside the cells and damaging them.
Character 1: Can humans do [whispering] that? The freezing thing?
226. Well, I mean, we're working on it, actually, but human bodies are, uhh, way more complex. Some researchers are studying those frogs to develop better organ preservation techniques though, which could revolutionize transplants.
Character 1: Speaking of organs, why do we only have one heart?
227. Honestly, it's probably because, you know, evolution found it sufficient for our lifestyle— we're not, like, filtering oxygen from water or anything. One four-chambered heart does the job pretty well for land mammals our size.
Character 1: Pretty well? That's not reassuring.
228. Okay, fair point, [angry] but consider this— having multiple hearts means multiple points of failure. Our single heart is incredibly resilient, beating about 2.5 billion times in an average lifetime without any conscious effort from us.
Character 1: 2.5 billion. Hmm, that's— wait, how do you even, like, calculate that?
229. Oh it's, uh, pretty straightforward math actually— about 70 beats per minute, er, times 60 minutes, times 24 hours, times 365 days, times, well, roughly 70 years. Give or take depending on fitness level and stress.
Character 1: My heart's probably done [laugh] a billion already then.
230. Ha, if you're in your thirties, you're definitely past the billion mark! But hey, you've got at least another billion and a half to go, statistically speaking. Your heart's just getting warmed up.
Character 1: I've been meaning to tell you [delighted] something for weeks now.
231. Oh? That sounds intriguing. What's been on your mind?
Character 1: Remember when you asked if I liked your presentation?
232. Yeah, I do remember, um, and honestly, you seemed, like, pretty enthusiastic about it at the time.
Character 1: Well, actually, I thought it was, you know, kind of boring and, er, way too long.
233. Wow, okay, so, that's refreshing to hear, I mean, even if it stings a bit, uhh, because honest feedback is really what helps us grow.
Character 1: You're not [chuckle] mad?
234. Mad? No, [laugh loudly] I'm actually, well, grateful because, you know, now I can fix it instead of, basically, continuing to bore people to death.
Character 1: The graphics were great though, I guess, really eye-catching and, hmm, professional looking.
235. Thanks for that, and, uh, the content probably needed, actually, [trailing off] more work than I realized...
Character 1: Exactly. Too much jargon.
236. You're absolutely [laugh loudly] right—I get so caught up in technical terms that I forget my audience isn't always fellow engineers.
Character 1: This feels [excited] so much better than pretending!
237. It really does, doesn't it, like, when we drop the politeness filter and, err, just say what we're thinking, anyway, conversations become more meaningful.
Character 1: I also, well, hate your coffee choice—French roast is, basically, just burnt beans.
238. Ha! Okay so, that one hurts because, you know, I pride myself on my coffee taste but, honestly, maybe I've been drinking charcoal this whole time.
Character 1: Medium roast has way more flavor complexity.
239. You might, umm, [enunciating every word] have a point there, I mean, I should probably, actually, branch out from my burnt bean addiction.
Character 1: See? Truth isn't that scary.
240. No, it's [sigh] not, and honestly this whole conversation makes me wonder how many other truths we've been dancing around.
Character 1: So I heard you've been [long pause] the cruise director here for fifteen years?
241. Fifteen years! Yes yes yes! Every sunrise, every sunset, every single wave that kisses this ship—I've orchestrated the joy that dances across these decks!
Character 1: That's quite the commitment.
242. Commitment? Oh darling, it's more than that, you know, it's a calling—like, the ocean chose me, and honestly, I answered with my entire soul!
Character 1: Do you ever get [mocking] tired of the same routes?
243. Tired? Never! Because—listen—every voyage is different, I mean, the passengers change, the weather shifts, and basically, each journey writes its own story, hmm, across the endless blue canvas!
Character 1: But surely, er, the activities get repetitive, you know, after all this time?
244. Repetitive! Ha! My friend, well, when you love what you do—really love it—each bingo night becomes, uh, a symphony, and anyway, every pool party transforms into pure magic!
Character 1: You really [chuckle] believe that?
245. Believe it? I LIVE it! Every morning I wake up and, actually, feel the ship's heartbeat—twenty thousand tons of steel, but honestly, she dances, she breathes, she sings!
Character 1: The ship sings?
246. Oh absolutely! Can't you [extremely happy] hear it? The engines hum their bass notes, um, the wind whistles through the rails, and basically, the waves provide percussion—it's nature's greatest orchestra, you know!
Character 1: I guess I've never, well, thought about it that way, kind of poetic actually.
247. Poetry! Motion! Life itself! That's what cruising is—we're not just, er, traveling from port to port; we're creating memories, anyway, that will echo through generations!
Character 1: You make it sound almost spiritual.
248. Spiritual? My dear passenger, uhh, the ocean IS church! The dolphins are our choir, and honestly, every sunset is a sermon about beauty, about possibility, I mean, about wonder!
Character 1: Can you teach me to see it [child-like] the way you do?
249. Teach you? Oh sweetheart! Close your eyes—feel that? That gentle rock? That's the ocean cradling you, whispering secrets older than time itself!
Character 1: I think I'm starting to understand.
250. Understanding is just the beginning! By journey's end, you won't just see the ocean—you'll BE the ocean, flowing and free and absolutely, magnificently alive!
Character 1: So you've been doing this cruise director thing for fifteen years. That's a long time.
251. Yeah, fifteen years and [excited] counting! Started when I was twenty-five, thought it'd be a gap year thing, but here I am still loving every minute of it.
Character 1: That's, um, a lot of fake smiling, I guess, for the passengers.
252. Oh no no, it's not fake at all, [passionately] I genuinely enjoy it! Meeting new people every week, seeing them relax and have fun, watching kids see dolphins for the first time—it never gets old.
Character 1: Come on, you know, you must get sick of, like, the same stupid questions every week.
253. Well, honestly, sure, I hear "what time is the midnight buffet" about, uhh, fifty times per cruise, but you know, for each person it's their first time asking, so I try to keep that perspective fresh.
Character 1: But, I mean, dealing with drunk people and complaints, er, all day must suck, right?
254. The drunk folks can be, um, challenging sometimes, but actually, most people are just happy to be on vacation, so, like, even the complaints usually come from a good place—they just want their trip to be perfect.
Character 1: You're way too positive, honestly, it's kind of, well, suspicious actually.
255. Ha! I get that a lot, but here's the thing, when you're literally, uhh, living on a floating resort visiting tropical islands, I mean, it's hard to be too cynical about life, you know?
Character 1: Do you ever just want to [deep pitch] throw someone overboard?
256. Oh god, there was this one [hesitantly] guy last month... But no, obviously not really, though I'd be lying if I said I hadn't fantasized about "accidentally" scheduling certain passengers for 6am yoga.
Character 1: Finally, some honesty! So, umm, what's the worst part, really, like the actual worst?
257. The worst part? Honestly, it's saying goodbye to the crew, you know, when contracts end—you basically become family living in these tight quarters, and then, well, suddenly they're gone and you might never see them again.
Character 1: That's surprisingly deep. Not what I expected.
258. Yeah, people think it's all mai tais and shuffleboard, but there's real human connection happening here, relationships that form under these weird, wonderful circumstances of being at sea together for months.
Character 1: Okay but, err, the seasickness must be awful, right, I mean, especially at first?
259. Oh man, my first week I was so green, like, I couldn't even look at food, but actually, after about ten days your body adjusts and now, umm, I feel weird on land—reverse seasickness is real!
Character 1: Wait, you get sick when you're NOT on a boat now?
260. Yeah! It's called mal de debarquement, and basically, when I go home for vacation, uhh, I spend the first few days feeling like the ground is moving, so really, I'm more comfortable at sea than on land these days.
Character 1: So, um, you've been fixing bikes here for, like, how long now, I mean, in this shop?
261. Oh well, going on twelve years [very loudly] now! Started as an apprentice, you know, when I was nineteen, and honestly, my hands have been covered in grease ever since.
Character 1: Must be tough on your back, all that bending over bikes.
262. Yeah, my back is [stuttering] sh-shot to hell, honestly, and my knees creak like an old door, but that's the trade for you—bodies aren't meant to be bent over bike frames eight hours a day.
Character 1: Do you [shy] ever think about doing something else?
263. Sometimes, uhh, when it's raining and my arthritis acts up, I mean, I dream about a desk job, but honestly, the thought of being stuck inside all day without actually, like, making something with my hands—that'd kill me faster than the back pain.
Character 1: What's the worst repair you've had to deal with?
264. Had this kid bring in a bike last week that looked like it went through a wood chipper—every single component was destroyed, took me fourteen hours over three days just to make it rideable again.
Character 1: That's, err, a lot of work for one bike, you know, was it even, basically, worth it?
265. Financially? Hell no, but, umm, the look on that kid's face when he saw it working again, I guess, that's why I keep doing this even when my body, like, screams at me to stop.
Character 1: Your hands look pretty beat up.
266. Oh these things? [laugh loudly] They're basically just scar tissue and calluses at this point! Cut myself on chainrings so many times I don't even feel it anymore, just notice the blood on the components.
Character 1: That's [cheerful] kind of hardcore actually!
267. It's not [apologetic] glamorous or anything, just years of small injuries adding up—broken fingers from wrenches slipping, burns from welding, cuts from cables, all part of the territory really.
Character 1: But you're [happy] still here, still working.
268. Yeah, I'm still [slowly] here, still turning wrenches, still coming home smelling like chain lube and degreaser, still waking up at five-thirty with hands too stiff to make coffee properly.
Character 1: Sounds, well, exhausting, really, like, how do you, actually, keep going every day?
269. Coffee, ibuprofen, and stubbornness mostly, but err, also because every bike that rolls out of here, you know, is someone's freedom, their transportation, basically their joy—that matters even when everything hurts.
Character 1: Do you, hmm, regret choosing this, I mean, this life, sort of?
270. Some mornings when I can barely straighten my fingers, yeah, but then I get under a bike and everything makes sense again—these machines need someone who understands them, and that someone happens to be me.
Character 1: Is this your first time [animated] donating blood, or are you a regular vampire buffet?
271. Well, I'm actually a, you know, [frustrated] regular donor, but honestly, calling it a vampire buffet is pretty accurate—they basically drain me every eight weeks like, um, clockwork.
Character 1: You look a bit [cheerful] pale already, and they haven't even started yet!
272. That's just my natural complexion, [jealous] thank you very much—not all of us can rock that healthy sun-kissed glow while voluntarily getting exsanguinated in a gymnasium.
Character 1: The cookies better be worth it.
273. Oh, they're absolutely terrible, like cardboard circles pretending to be food, but after losing a pint of blood, even sawdust tastes like a five-star meal somehow.
Character 1: Did you, um, eat breakfast, or are you, like, planning to pass out for the, er, full experience?
274. Had three eggs, toast, and orange juice because fainting in front of strangers isn't my idea of a good Thursday morning, though it would make things more exciting.
Character 1: That nurse looks like she could bench press both of us.
275. She definitely could, and [sarcastic] she'd probably do it one-handed while finding a vein with her eyes closed—these phlebotomists have superhuman strength from wrestling nervous donors all day.
Character 1: Why do they, well, always ask if you've been to, umm, exotic locations, like, as if malaria is just hanging out at the, you know, local mall?
276. Legal requirements, I guess, though I [regretful] always feel boring saying no—like, honestly, the most exotic place I've been lately is, um, the sketchy taco truck behind the gas station.
Character 1: Your arm looks like a pincushion from past donations.
277. Yeah, I've got a whole constellation of tiny scars, but I tell people they're from my underground boxing career because "chronic blood donor" doesn't sound nearly as cool.
Character 1: The guy next to you just got juice and he looks absolutely thrilled.
278. That's because the juice here is legendary—it's the exact temperature and sweetness that makes you forget you're essentially a human Capri Sun for the next ten minutes.
Character 1: Do you ever, like, worry about them taking too much, I mean, accidentally, or, well, forgetting to stop?
279. Nah, they've got it down to a science, though, er, sometimes I wonder if they're actually, you know, secretly collecting for vampires and this whole medical thing is just, basically, a cover story.
Character 1: That's, hmm, oddly specific—have you, um, seen something suspicious, or like, are you just naturally paranoid?
280. Let's just say, well, when the night shift nurse has no reflection in the bathroom mirror and, actually, keeps complimenting my "excellent veins," you know, a person starts to, uh, wonder about things.
Character 1: So, um, you're really going to [joking] break into the observatory tonight with, like, just a paperclip and... what, exactly?
281. A paperclip, three magnets from my grandmother's fridge, and an expired campus ID from 2019. The security system hasn't been updated since the Cold War—I calculated a 97% success rate if we move during the guard's bathroom break.
Character 1: You, uh, calculated his bathroom schedule? That's... well, that's actually kind of disturbing, you know?
282. Every Tuesday at 11:47 PM, like clockwork—poor guy has [warm] irritable bowel syndrome from the cafeteria chili. Look, I'm not proud of the surveillance, but astronomical discoveries wait for no one's digestive system.
Character 1: What if, I mean, we get caught? My scholarship... honestly, my entire future depends on not, er, getting expelled.
283. Expelled? Please. We're not stealing anything—we're correcting a fundamental error in their asteroid trajectory calculations that could literally save humanity from extinction in 2087. If anything, they should give us honorary degrees.
Character 1: You can't be serious about the asteroid thing.
284. Dead serious. Their margin of error is off by 0.0003%—sounds tiny, right? But compound that over sixty-three years and boom, we're talking Manhattan-sized space rock versus harmless fly-by.
Character 1: Why not just... email them?
285. Tried that. Six times. They think I'm a crackpot undergraduate who watches too much sci-fi—which, fair, guilty as charged—but my math is solid.
Character 1: Your "solid math" also said we could build a functioning rocket out of Diet Coke and Mentos.
286. That was different! The thrust-to-weight [laugh hard] ratio was theoretically sound until Karen from housing called the fire department. Besides, we got seventeen feet of vertical lift before structural failure—that's not nothing!
Character 1: Okay so, um, hypothetically—and I'm [speeding up] not saying yes—but, like, how exactly would we, you know, even get past the main entrance?
287. Through the heating vents, obviously. I've been mapping the HVAC system for three months—Tuesday night they reduce airflow to save energy, making it perfectly safe for human traversal.
Character 1: The vents? That's... actually, that's your plan? We're not, I mean, action heroes—well, you're barely five-foot-four!
288. Five-foot-three-and-three-quarters, thank you very much. And that's exactly why it'll work—I'm the perfect size for those ducts, plus I've been doing yoga specifically to prepare for this.
Character 1: You've been doing yoga... to, er, prepare for breaking and entering? That's, honestly, the most you thing I've ever heard.
289. Look, it's basically just aggressive astronomy at this point. And, um, technically it's not breaking if nothing, you know, actually breaks—we're more like... temporarily borrowing their telescope to save Earth.
Character 1: I can't believe I'm, well, even considering this. My mom would, like, literally kill me if she knew I was, uh, discussing felonies with the campus genius-slash-lunatic.
290. Genius-slash-lunatic? That's the nicest thing [flirtatious] anyone's called me all semester. Come on, when we save the world, your mom will forgive you—plus, I promise to name the asteroid after you when we're heroes.
Character 1: Hi there! I'm Sarah, your [extremely happy] peer counselor for today's session. Is this your first time at the wellness center?
291. Oh, um, fantastic—another [sarcastic] peppy volunteer who thinks, you know, a chat and some breathing exercises will fix my existential dread. But yeah, it's my first time, I guess.
Character 1: I, uh, totally get the skepticism, actually. Most people think we're, like, going to force positivity down their throats.
292. Sorry, that was... I mean, that was [very sad] harsh. I've been, well, kind of attacking everyone who tries to help lately—it's basically my new defense mechanism.
Character 1: Hey, no judgment here. Attack away if it helps. Better than keeping it all bottled up, right?
293. You're different from what I expected. Most counselors start with the whole "how does that make you feel" routine or immediately suggest I journal about my childhood trauma.
Character 1: Journaling is, er, overrated anyway. I mean, who has time to, you know, write poetry about their pain when Netflix exists?
294. Exactly! My last therapist, um, wanted me to write [cry] gratitude lists while I can barely, like, get out of bed most mornings. The thing is, I haven't slept properly in three weeks.
Character 1: Three weeks? That's, well, that's rough. What keeps you up—racing thoughts, or, I mean, is it more like anxiety about specific stuff?
295. Oh, just the usual—impending climate doom, student loans I'll never [condescending] pay off, and whether I'm slowly morphing into my emotionally unavailable father. You know, light bedtime thoughts that definitely promote restful sleep.
Character 1: Your father thing—that's, um, actually something I wrestle with too. Like, I catch myself doing his disappointed sigh sometimes and, honestly, want to scream.
296. Wait, you actually relate? This isn't some [excited] counselor trick where you pretend to understand? Because I've had enough people minimize my issues while secretly thinking I'm dramatic.
Character 1: No tricks. I'm here because I crashed and burned spectacularly last year. Now I help others to make sense of my own mess.
297. That's... that's refreshingly [whispering] honest. Most people here pretend they've got it all together. You're saying you're just as screwed up as the rest of us?
Character 1: Oh, I'm, uh, probably [shy] worse, honestly. Last semester I, well, had a panic attack during my own therapy certification exam—kind of ironic, right?
298. You had a panic attack DURING [shouting] your therapy exam?! That's actually hilarious—sorry, I shouldn't laugh, but the irony is killing me here!
Character 1: No, please [groan] laugh! I literally wrote "help me" on the exam paper instead of answering question three.
299. Okay, that tops my breakdown story. I just ugly-cried in the campus Starbucks when they got my order wrong—barista gave me free coffee for a month out of sheer terror.
Character 1: The Starbucks on, um, Fifth Street? Because I [sniffle] definitely saw that happen and, er, it wasn't that bad—you know, comparatively speaking.
300. You saw that?! Oh god, that's, um, mortifying but also [whispering] weirdly comforting. So, basically, we're both disasters pretending to be functional adults—want to, you know, compare coping mechanisms that don't actually work?
Character 1: So you're telling me you've never been to a escape room before? Not even once?
301. Never! I know, I know, it's weird—everyone's always talking about them like they're this amazing bonding experience, but honestly the whole concept stresses me out. Being locked in a room with a ticking clock and people yelling random theories about puzzles? That sounds like my personal nightmare.
Character 1: Oh come on, um, it's not [child-like] scary at all, you know, it's more like, well, playing detective for an hour!
302. Playing detective with five other people who all think they're Sherlock Holmes, you mean. My sister dragged me to one last year—well, almost dragged me, I bailed in the parking lot because I started overthinking whether I'd be the weak link who couldn't solve anything and everyone would secretly hate me.
Character 1: Wait wait wait, so, you literally sat in the parking lot while, I mean, everyone else went in? That's, er, kind of amazing actually.
303. Amazing? No no no, it was— okay so, the thing is, I sat there for the entire hour scrolling through Reddit reading escape room tips, you know, in case they asked me to join for round two. I actually became an expert on escape rooms without ever, hmm, stepping foot in one—I can tell you about false bottoms and blacklight clues and red herrings but I've never actually touched a real puzzle.
Character 1: That's the most backwards preparation I've ever heard. Did they ask you to join round two?
304. They came out all pumped up and sweaty—apparently they'd barely escaped with like, uh, thirty seconds left, and my sister was actually, you know, kind of relieved I hadn't gone in because, well, she said I would've spent twenty minutes questioning whether we were allowed to move the furniture.
Character 1: I'm, um, actually [shy] the same way though, like, I overthink everything and, honestly, need explicit permission to touch things in stores.
305. Oh thank god, another overthinker! You know what's funny though—and please, [overly polite] forgive me if this sounds ridiculous—but I've actually designed three different escape rooms in my head, complete with storylines and puzzle progressions, because apparently my brain thinks if I can't do them, I might as well create them.
Character 1: You designed escape rooms you're [sarcastic] too scared to enter? That's peak anxiety behavior right there.
306. Right?! One's about a haunted library where—okay, er, this is embarrassing but I mean, I have a whole notebook about it—where you have to decode messages using actual Dewey Decimal system, and there's this subplot about a librarian ghost who only speaks in literary quotes, honestly, I spent three weeks researching Victorian ghost stories for authenticity.
Character 1: No that's, well, that's [apologetic] actually brilliant, I mean, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt but, um, would you seriously not play your own escape room?
307. Absolutely not! See, here's the thing, I know all the answers so there's no challenge, but also, like, what if other people solved it differently than I intended? I'd probably, actually, stand in the corner having an existential crisis about whether my puzzle logic was flawed while everyone else just, you know, enjoyed themselves.
Character 1: Okay but, uh, you realize you're basically [loudly] torturing yourself right? Like, you could, I mean, just try one—just once—and, well, see what happens?
308. You know what, when you put it like that, with that [flirtatious] passionate conviction in your voice, maybe I could be convinced—but only if you promise to be on my team and handle all the touching-mysterious-objects parts while I stand back and theorize dramatically.
Character 1: Deal! But, um, I should warn you, like, I get really [child-like] competitive and might, you know, accidentally yell at inanimate objects.
309. Perfect, we'll be the worst escape room team ever—you yelling at fake doors while I spiral about whether we're using the correct problem-solving methodology. The gamemaster will probably have to give us extra hints out of pure pity, but at least we'll have good stories afterward.
Character 1: Stories are, well, honestly the best part anyway—like, nobody really remembers who solved what, er, they just remember who freaked out the most.
310. Exactly! And between your furniture-yelling and my philosophical debates with puzzle boxes, we're guaranteed to be memorable—though probably not in the "employee of the month" photos they keep on their winner's wall, more like in the "remember those two disasters from Tuesday" kind of way.
Character 1: So, um, Coach Martinez, I've been thinking, you know, about quitting the team after what happened last week.
311. Hold on, hold on—let's talk about this, actually, before you make any big decisions, right? I've been coaching for fifteen years, and honestly, I've seen plenty of rough patches that seemed like the end of the world but turned into turning points.
Character 1: But I, like, completely choked in front of everyone, I mean, missed every single shot, er, when it mattered most!
312. Listen, missing shots is, well, part of the game—even Michael Jordan missed over nine thousand shots in his career, you know? What matters isn't the misses themselves, it's actually how you respond to them, how you let them shape your next practice, your next game.
Character 1: That's different though, uh, Jordan was already great, basically, I'm just... I don't know, maybe not cut out for this.
313. You know what I was [joking] craving this morning? A time machine to show you the footage of yourself six months ago, barely able to dribble without tripping. You've come so far you can't even see your starting point anymore.
Character 1: Six months isn't that long, um, maybe I just got lucky, you know, for a while.
314. There's no luck in the hours you've put in, the [sad] dedication I've watched you display every single day. When everyone else left practice, you stayed shooting free throws until the janitor kicked us out—that's not luck, that's character.
Character 1: But what if I freeze up again next game?
315. Then we'll work through it together, er, just like we always do, honestly. Champions aren't made by never falling—they're made by, well, getting up one more time than they fall, and you've got that quality in spades.
Character 1: How can you, like, be so sure though, I mean, when I'm not even sure about myself?
316. Because I've seen you push through shin splints, study game film until your eyes hurt, and help younger players even when you were exhausted. Those aren't the actions of someone who quits—those are the actions of someone who's building something lasting.
Character 1: Maybe you're right, um, [cough] sorry, getting emotional here, but like, what if the team doesn't trust me anymore?
317. Your teammates were all in the locker room after, you know, talking about how they wished they'd, basically, set better screens for you. They're not blaming you—they're, actually, figuring out how to support you better because that's what teams do.
Character 1: Really? They, er, said that? [stuttering] I-I thought, well, I mean, I thought they were disappointed in me.
318. Disappointed? They were disappointed in themselves for not having your back when the pressure mounted. Sarah specifically said she should've called for a timeout when she saw you getting overwhelmed—that's a team that believes in you.
Character 1: I guess I've been, sort of, so wrapped up in my own head, you know, I didn't even notice.
319. That's natural when you're hurting, but here's the thing, right? Tomorrow's practice isn't about proving anything to anyone—it's, well, just about showing up, putting in the work, and, actually, remembering why you fell in love with this game in the first place.
Character 1: You always know [empathetically] exactly what to say to pull me out of these spirals.
320. That's my job, kiddo, but more importantly, I mean, it's the truth—you're stronger than this moment, basically. And, uh, when you look back on this season years from now, you'll see this wasn't the end of your story, it was just, honestly, the chapter where you learned what you were really made of.
Character 1: Wait, um, did you see that? Over there by the, you know, acacia trees? I could've sworn I actually saw something moving.
321. I'm watching the road mainly, but there's definitely movement everywhere out here—probably just zebras grazing in the distance. You've got better eyes than me for spotting wildlife though, always have.
Character 1: No, er, it was bigger, I mean, like sort of elephant-sized but I can't be sure.
322. Elephants don't really hang out [mocking] solo in this part of the reserve, trust me on that. More likely you're seeing those termite mounds—they look massive from this angle when the light hits them just right.
Character 1: Maybe you're right. I always think I see things that aren't there.
323. Hey now, don't sell yourself short—last time we were out here you spotted that leopard everyone else missed completely. Your instincts are usually spot on, even when you doubt them, which happens way too often if you ask me.
Character 1: That was probably just luck though.
324. Stop, there's something, well, moving in those bushes—honestly, I think it's uhh, actually something big, basically right where you were pointing earlier!
Character 1: Really? So, I was, like, [cheerful] actually right? Oh wait, I guess I can't tell what it is from here.
325. It's a whole family of elephants [laugh hard] emerging from behind those trees—you totally called it! There must be at least eight of them, including what looks like two calves staying close to their mothers.
Character 1: I can't believe I actually spotted them first!
326. You always do this, hmm, doubting yourself when, the thing is, you've got incredible observation skills, anyway. Remember when you noticed those lion tracks yesterday that our guide completely walked past without seeing?
Character 1: Those could've been, uh, anything though, kind of just marks in the dirt, it's just that I thought they looked like tracks.
327. The guide literally confirmed they were fresh lion tracks, really, and err, changed our entire route because of your observation, right so don't minimize that! You've got a natural eye for this stuff, even if you can't seem to hear me telling you that over and over.
Character 1: I just don't want to be wrong and waste everyone's time.
328. Wrong about what exactly—being observant, being careful, being interested in the world around you? Those aren't flaws, they're exactly why I love doing these drives with you, even when you can't seem to hear your own value.
Character 1: You're being too nice, actually, but [friendly] thank you for saying that, you know, it means a lot, basically.
329. Look, ah, there's a giraffe coming up on our left, I mean, but you probably already spotted it five minutes ago, well, didn't you?
Character 1: Maybe I did see something tall back there.
330. Of course you did—you always see things before anyone else does, that's your superpower out here. One day you'll actually believe me when I tell you how good you are at this, but until then, I'll just keep repeating myself.
Character 1: So, um, why is it, like, so hard to actually, you know, change our habits?
331. Well, honestly, our brains are basically wired to, er, run on autopilot. Most of what we do each day happens without conscious thought, which is efficient but makes changing those patterns really challenging.
Character 1: But people change all the time, don't they?
332. Sure, but, um, real lasting change [stern] is actually pretty rare, you know. Studies show that about 92% of New Year's resolutions fail by February, which tells you something about how tough this really is.
Character 1: 92%? That's, uh, depressing. So like, why do we even, I mean, bother trying?
333. Because, well, the 8% who succeed, they actually, hmm, figure out something important. They don't rely on willpower alone—they change their environment and create systems that make the new behavior easier than the old one.
Character 1: Systems? What kind of systems?
334. Okay so, um, take exercise—instead of [cough] relying on motivation, er, successful people pack their gym bag the night before. They choose a gym on their commute route, not across town. It's about removing friction, basically.
Character 1: That sounds too simple to actually work.
335. I know it [shaky voice] sounds simple, but that's exactly why it works. Our brains are lazy—they'll take the path of least resistance every time, so you have to make the good choice the easy choice.
Character 1: What about when the bad choice is already the easiest?
336. Ah, that's where you, well, need to add friction to the bad behavior, right? Hide the cookies, delete social media apps, put your alarm clock across the room—basically, you know, make yourself work for the thing you're trying to avoid.
Character 1: But doesn't that, um, just make you, like, resent the process even more, honestly?
337. Ha! Sometimes, yeah, but [laugh histerically] here's the weird thing—after about 66 days on average, the new behavior starts feeling automatic. Your brain literally rewires itself to prefer the new pattern over the old one.
Character 1: 66 days? I thought it was 21.
338. That 21-day myth, er, came from a plastic surgeon in the 1960s who, um, noticed his patients, you know, took about three weeks to adjust to their new faces. But actual habit formation research shows it's much more variable—anywhere from 18 to 254 days depending on the complexity.
Character 1: 254 days? That's most of a year!
339. Yeah, for really complex behaviors like learning to meditate daily or completely changing your diet. But simpler stuff like drinking a glass of water with lunch can stick in just a few weeks if you're consistent.
Character 1: So basically, um, we're all just, like, fighting our own brains, huh?
340. Pretty much! But once you understand that your brain is trying to conserve energy, not sabotage you, you can work with it instead of against it. It's actually kind of liberating when you stop taking it personally.
Character 1: So, I was, um, contemplating the inherent contradictions in, you know, Baudrillard's simulacra theory, basically how reality itself becomes questionable.
341. That's fascinating and all, but your interpretation needs some serious refinement. You're conflating his third and fourth orders of simulacra, which completely undermines the precision of his argument about hyperreality.
Character 1: Well, I mean, that's a rather pedestrian reading, honestly, don't you think? The thing is, contemporary scholarship has moved beyond those rigid categories.
342. No no no, er, you're missing the fundamental point here, like, if we don't maintain those distinctions then, actually, the entire theoretical framework collapses. Every single detail matters when you're discussing postmodern philosophy—you can't just handwave the nuances away.
Character 1: Hmm, perhaps you're, sort of, too wedded to orthodox interpretations? I guess, anyway, my perspective draws from Deleuze's critique.
343. Drawing from Deleuze is fine, but, uh, you need to cite the exact text, the exact page, really—otherwise it's just, you know, intellectual sloppiness. Which edition are you referencing, which translation, which commentary?
Character 1: Oh, well, does it, err, truly matter? The ideas themselves, kind of, transcend such mundane concerns, honestly.
344. Of course it matters, I mean, every translation introduces subtle shifts in meaning, uhh, which can completely, basically, alter the philosophical implications! You can't just throw around these concepts without absolute precision in your sources.
Character 1: I find your obsession with [very loudly] minutiae rather limiting to genuine intellectual discourse.
345. It's not minutiae, actually, it's about getting things exactly right, um, because if we don't, well, then what's the point of academic discussion at all? Every comma, every footnote, every single reference needs to be perfect or the entire argument falls apart.
Character 1: Perhaps we should [chuckle] acknowledge that, uhh, philosophy itself resists such, you know, rigid systematization, anyway.
346. Philosophy demands rigor and exactitude above all else. You can't just make sweeping generalizations without supporting every single claim with bulletproof evidence and flawless logical progression.
Character 1: Hmm, that seems, er, rather constraining to the creative spirit of philosophical inquiry, don't you think? Like, basically, you're imposing scientific methodology onto humanistic thought.
347. There's nothing constraining about demanding excellence and accuracy in every single statement. If anything, true creativity emerges from working within perfectly defined parameters and meeting impossibly high standards.
Character 1: Well, I suppose, um, we simply occupy different intellectual paradigms, you know? The thing is, mine allows for more... fluidity.
348. Fluidity is just another word for imprecision. Real scholarship requires obsessive attention to detail, checking and rechecking every citation, every argument, every single logical connection until it's absolutely flawless.
Character 1: How terribly exhausting that must be.
349. Exhausting but necessary. You simply cannot make philosophical claims without verifying every source, cross-referencing every concept, and ensuring complete internal consistency throughout your entire argumentative structure.
Character 1: Actually, I find that, err, such fastidiousness often obscures, well, the deeper truths we're, sort of, seeking to illuminate.
350. No, uhh, the deeper truths only emerge through, you know, meticulous analysis and basically perfect execution of scholarly method. Anything less is just, hmm, intellectual laziness masquerading as creativity.
Character 1: So, um, these numbers you're reading, are they, you know, basically for the final offer?
351. Well, yeah, these are, er, the inspection costs and kind of the closing fees, actually. Let me start with the mosaic restoration in the entryway—that's coming in at $3,200, which includes all the vintage tiles I'll need to source.
Character 1: That's honestly higher than, [very sincerely], I expected, uh, but I mean, I trust your expertise.
352. So, I know it sounds high, but uhh, the thing is, matching those 1920s patterns is like finding buried treasure. Next up, the foundation repair estimate is $8,500, and the roof replacement is coming in at $12,300.
Character 1: Wow, um, I'm feeling, [shy], sort of overwhelmed by all these, anyway, big numbers.
353. Hey, I totally get it—buying a fixer-upper is scary. The plumbing update is $4,800, electrical rewiring is $6,200, and honestly, those are both really reasonable quotes from contractors I trust.
Character 1: Hmm, you know, what about the, really, what about the kitchen?
354. Ah, well, [relieved], the kitchen is actually in better shape than we thought. Cabinet refacing is only $2,100, new appliances will run about $5,500, and I can do a gorgeous mosaic backsplash for $1,800.
Character 1: And the bathrooms?
355. Both bathrooms together are looking at $9,400 for full renovation. But here's the good news—I can incorporate some salvaged tiles from my workshop, which will give them amazing character without extra cost.
Character 1: These numbers are, [shaky voice], making my head spin a little.
356. I know, err, it's a lot to process, basically, but I guess the total renovation budget is coming in at $54,600. That's actually below the $60,000 we initially estimated, and this house will be absolutely stunning when we're done.
Character 1: Below budget? That's unexpected.
357. Right? And uh, here's something else—the seller's credits are, honestly, $7,500, which kind of helps offset things. Plus, the home warranty they're including covers $1,200 worth of potential issues for the first year.
Character 1: What about your mosaic work specifically?
358. So my work, um, [very quietly], you know, it's just that I'm charging $8,400 total for all three installations. That includes the entryway restoration, the kitchen backsplash, and a custom piece for the master bathroom—all with materials included.
Character 1: That seems really reasonable for custom art.
359. Thank you! The closing costs are $6,300, property taxes for the year are $4,200, and homeowner's insurance is quoting at $1,800 annually.
Character 1: Well, uhh, when you add it all up, it's sort of terrifying but exciting?
360. So, I mean, yes it's a big investment, but hmm, this house has incredible bones, and actually, with these renovations, you're looking at adding probably $80,000 in value. These numbers are just the beginning of something really beautiful.
Character 1: So um, this experimental design is, [bitter], basically flawed, you know, from the start?
361. No, actually the design is perfectly sound. We're using a double-blind randomized control trial with three treatment groups and appropriate statistical power—this methodology has been validated in over forty similar studies.
Character 1: Well, I mean, what about the, er, sample size? It seems sort of small to me.
362. The sample size of 240 participants is honestly more than adequate, uh, with 80 participants per group giving us like 95% power to detect a medium effect size. I ran the power analysis three times using different software packages, and they all confirm this is statistically robust.
Character 1: But the control group seems weird.
363. The control group is [bitter] exactly what we need for this study. They're receiving the standard treatment protocol, which gives us a perfect baseline for comparing the two experimental interventions—this is textbook experimental design.
Character 1: What about confounding variables?
364. We've controlled for [upset] every major confound through stratified randomization. Age, gender, baseline scores, medication history, and socioeconomic status are all balanced across groups, plus we're using ANCOVA to adjust for any remaining variance.
Character 1: So, hmm, how long will this actually take to run?
365. Twelve weeks for [speeding up] the intervention phase, then six months of follow-up. The timeline is aggressive but completely doable—I've managed three similar studies with even tighter deadlines, and we finished ahead of schedule.
Character 1: The ethics approval seems complicated.
366. Already handled. The IRB gave full approval last week with no modifications required, and I've secured consent forms that exceed all federal requirements for human subjects research.
Character 1: Err, what about, anyway, the kind of statistical analysis you're planning?
367. Mixed-effects modeling with intention-to-treat analysis as primary, per-protocol as secondary. This approach handles missing data optimally and gives us both efficacy and effectiveness estimates—it's the gold standard for clinical trials.
Character 1: Uhh, the thing is, your budget looks [mocking] optimistic, I guess.
368. The budget is locked in with 15% contingency built in. I've negotiated fixed rates with all vendors, secured the lab space at a 40% discount, and our grant covers everything with $50,000 to spare.
Character 1: Right so, you know, what about recruitment? That's ah, always the hardest part.
369. Recruitment is it's just that we're already at 60% enrollment, umm, three weeks before we really need to start. I have partnerships with five clinics, social media campaigns running, and a waiting list of 85 interested participants.
Character 1: Hmmm, basically your confidence is, okay so, either impressive or concerning?
370. It's confidence based on experience and preparation. I've published twelve papers using this exact methodology, trained under the researcher who developed this protocol, and every single metric indicates this study will succeed.
Character 1: Hey, um, you must be the new person joining our team, right? I'm so, like, excited to finally meet you!
371. Yes, that's me! I'm starting today in the marketing department, and honestly I'm a bit nervous but really thrilled to be here—everyone seems so welcoming already.
Character 1: Oh you're gonna love it here, I mean, the culture is just, er, absolutely amazing, you know?
372. That's wonderful to hear! I was, [curious], honestly wondering what the team dynamics were like, since during my interview everyone seemed so collaborative and supportive.
Character 1: Well, the thing is, we really do support each other here, uh, like genuinely care about, you know, everyone's success.
373. That's exactly what I was [yawn] hoping for in my next role. My last job was so competitive and cutthroat, I'm really looking forward to actually enjoying coming to work again.
Character 1: I totally get that, umm, toxic workplaces are just, basically, soul-crushing, right?
374. Absolutely! So, actually, what department are you in, and, um, how long have you been here, if you don't mind me asking?
Character 1: I've been here three years in product development, and, well, it's honestly been the best, you know, career move I've ever made!
375. Three years is a good sign! I always, like, pay attention to retention rates because, uh, happy employees stick around, right?
Character 1: Exactly! And the growth opportunities here are incredible.
376. That's music to my ears! I'm really hoping to, er, expand my skills and maybe, you know, eventually move into strategic planning.
Character 1: Oh you definitely can! Our CEO actually started [sleepily] in marketing just like you!
377. No way, seriously? That's [chuckle] incredibly inspiring! I had no idea the company promoted from within that much—that makes me even more excited about the possibilities here.
Character 1: Yeah, internal promotion is huge here, they really invest in people.
378. I can already tell I'm going to [smiling speaking] love working here. The energy is just so positive, and hearing about the career paths makes me feel like I made the right choice.
Character 1: You absolutely did! Though, um, I should mention the coffee machine is, [upset], kind of terrible, but hey, that's like our only real complaint!
379. Ha! I can live with bad coffee if everything else is this good—besides, there's a great café around the corner I noticed on my way in.
Character 1: Oh yeah, Coastal Café! We, err, actually have a team coffee run every Friday morning, it's sort of, you know, become this nice tradition.
380. That sounds perfect, I'll definitely join [monotone] in on that. Small traditions like that really help build team cohesion and create those informal bonding moments that matter.
Character 1: Hey, I've been looking at our quarterly reports and I'm confused about ROA calculations.
381. Oh, return on assets! So, it's actually, um, one of the most important profitability metrics we use, and basically it shows how efficiently a company, you know, uses its assets to generate earnings.
Character 1: Right, but like, I'm getting different numbers when I, er, calculate it myself versus what's, you know, shown in the report.
382. Let me help you with that—ROA is [apologetic] calculated by dividing net income by total assets, but sometimes people use average total assets instead of ending assets, which could explain the discrepancy.
Character 1: Wait, so there's, uhh, more than one way to, I mean, calculate it? That seems, well, kind of confusing.
383. Yes! There are actually several variations depending on what you're trying to analyze—some analysts prefer using operating income instead of net income to exclude interest and tax effects.
Character 1: I'm [shaky voice] worried I've been presenting wrong data to management this whole time.
384. Don't worry too much about it! The key is being consistent with whichever method you choose and clearly stating your calculation methodology in your presentations.
Character 1: Okay, but, hmm, which method do you, actually, recommend for our industry? We're in, er, manufacturing.
385. For manufacturing companies, I'd, you know, suggest using average total assets because, honestly, your asset base fluctuates significantly throughout the year with inventory and equipment purchases, so, um, averaging gives a more representative picture.
Character 1: That makes sense. What's, like, considered a good ROA in manufacturing anyway? I guess, you know, I should probably benchmark us against, uh, industry standards.
386. Excellent question! In manufacturing, an ROA between 5% and 10% is generally considered healthy, though it varies by subsector—heavy machinery tends lower while electronics can be higher.
Character 1: Our ROA is, well, sitting at about 6.8%, which, I mean, sounds okay then? But, er, I feel like we should be doing better.
387. Actually, 6.8% is, you know, pretty solid! But here's the thing, you should also, um, look at the trend over time and compare it to your direct competitors, not just, basically, industry averages.
Character 1: How do I, uhh, improve it though? Like, what are the, sort of, main levers we can, actually, pull?
388. Great strategic thinking! So, you can either, hmm, increase net income through better pricing or cost management, or, well, reduce assets by improving inventory turnover and, you know, selling off underutilized equipment.
Character 1: What about taking on debt to finance growth? Would that help ROA?
389. Interesting question! Taking on debt doesn't directly increase your total assets since you get cash, but if you invest that capital wisely and generate returns above your cost of debt, it can boost your ROA over time.
Character 1: This is, honestly, super helpful. I'm thinking, err, we should maybe, like, do a deeper dive into our asset utilization, you know, department by department.
390. That's exactly what I'd recommend! Actually, segmenting ROA by division or product line, um, reveals where you're creating value and where assets are, basically, being tied up unproductively—it's, well, incredibly insightful for strategic planning.
Character 1: So, I've been, um, trying to master my tracks myself but they sound, you know, nothing like the reference songs.
391. Yeah, that's totally normal when you're starting out. Mastering is about getting your mix to translate across different systems while hitting commercial loudness standards.
Character 1: But I've watched like twenty YouTube tutorials and I'm still lost.
392. Look, the thing is, tutorials often skip the fundamentals—you need, well, properly calibrated monitoring first, and honestly, your room acoustics matter more than any plugin you'll buy.
Character 1: My room is treated though, I put up foam everywhere.
393. Foam alone won't [angry] fix your problems! You need proper bass trapping and broadband absorption, not just random foam tiles that only eat high frequencies.
Character 1: Okay okay, er, maybe I need to, I guess, invest more in treatment. What about, hmm, the actual mastering chain?
394. Well, I usually start with, uhh, [very quietly] corrective EQ to fix any tonal imbalances, then, you know, compression for glue, and basically, limiting at the end for loudness.
Character 1: Obviously I know about [condescending] EQ and compression. I'm asking about the specific settings.
395. Right, so, there's no magic settings because, actually, every mix needs different treatment—but I mean, generally you want subtle moves, like, 1-2 dB maximum on your EQ bands.
Character 1: What about LUFS targets? Everyone says different numbers.
396. Streaming platforms mostly normalize to -14 LUFS integrated, but I master to around -9 to -10 for dynamic genres. It preserves punch while still being competitive.
Character 1: But, uh, won't that get turned down anyway? Like, I don't, sort of, understand the point of mastering loud if it's just, basically, getting normalized.
397. Here's the thing, even with normalization, a well-mastered track at -9 LUFS will, honestly, sound punchier than one at -14 because, um, you've shaped the dynamics intentionally rather than just, err, leaving headroom.
Character 1: How do you know when a master is actually finished though?
398. Trust your ears across multiple systems—car speakers, earbuds, phone speakers. When it sounds balanced everywhere and nothing jumps out as wrong, you're done.
Character 1: I've been, well, A/B testing against commercial tracks but mine always sound, you know, thinner and, actually, less wide somehow.
399. Width often comes from the mix, not mastering. But subtle stereo enhancement on just the highs above 8kHz can add air without destroying your mono compatibility.
Character 1: Should I, hmm, just hire someone? I mean, this is taking forever and I'm, kind of, not sure I'm getting anywhere.
400. Sometimes that's the smartest move—a good mastering engineer has [gasp] years of trained ears plus proper monitoring, and honestly, the objectivity of not mixing the track is invaluable!
Character 1: [trembling] Master, um, I've been watching you these past weeks and, [voice breaking], something is happening to you that I, well, [desperate], I don't understand but I know it's connected to the prophecy.
401. [gentle] You were always, [measured], the most observant of my disciples, weren't you, though I tried, [weary], so hard to hide this burden from all of you, [exhale], especially from you. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [barely audible] Please don't leave.
402. The prophecy speaks of sacrifice, [stern], but what they never tell you is that the chosen one, [bitter], doesn't get to choose anything at all, not even, [hollow], how it ends. [long pause]
Character 1: There has to be, [frantic], another way because I've read every text in the archives and nowhere, [determined], does it explicitly say you have to die. [voice cracks]
403. [resigned] My dear child, the words don't matter when the magic itself, [heavy], is already taking what it needs from me.
Character 1: [pleading] But master, um, I mean, you taught me that prophecies are, [desperate], interpretations and that fate can be, well, [fierce], rewritten if we're brave enough to try, so like, [shaking], why won't you fight this?
404. [soft] Because fighting this, [thoughtful], would mean passing this burden to someone else, perhaps even, [pained], to you, and that is a price I will never, [firm], allow anyone else to pay. [exhales]
Character 1: [urgent] You don't get to make that choice for me when I've trained, [angry], my entire life for this moment, to stand beside you, [breaking], not to watch you fade away.
405. [weakening] Listen to me, um, really listen now because, [labored], there isn't much time left and you need to, well, [focused], understand that your role was never to save me but to, er, [proud], continue what I cannot finish.
Character 1: [desperate] Every lesson you taught me says that accepting defeat, [furious], without exhausting every option is the ultimate failure.
406. [tender] Sometimes, my stubborn apprentice, the greatest victory is, um, [wise], knowing when to let go and trust that what you've built will, like, [peaceful], stand without you, and you, well, [loving], you are what I've built.
Character 1: You speak of trust but you won't, [accusatory], trust me enough to help you find another way.
407. [firm] Because, um, I've already seen what happens when we try to cheat fate, and the cost, well, [haunted], it's always someone innocent who pays.
Character 1: [defiant] Then, well, I mean, let me be the one who pays because I'm choosing this with, [resolute], full knowledge of what it means.
408. You think you understand sacrifice but you're, [sad], still so young and full of fire that burns without knowing what it consumes.
Character 1: [quiet] Maybe that fire is exactly what's needed to change, [determined], what everyone believes is unchangeable, to break this cycle that's taken, [fierce], so many chosen ones before you. [whispers]
409. [contemplative] You sound like I did once, before I learned that some prices, [regretful], are set in stone older than memory itself.
Character 1: [steady] Then teach me one last lesson about how to carry on when everything I've believed in, [broken], walks willingly into darkness.
410. [loving] The lesson is this: what feels like darkness to you, [peaceful], is simply the space between one light ending and, [hopeful], another beginning through you.
Character 1: My son's been coming home with, [controlled anger], gun oil under his fingernails and now I find out he's been, [trembling], spending afternoons in your shop instead of at, [bitter], basketball practice like he's been telling me.
411. [calm] The boy showed up three months ago asking about, [careful], apprenticeships and I told him to bring permission from his parents first. [sighs]
Character 1: [frustrated] Permission that he obviously never got because I would've remembered having a conversation about my fifteen-year-old, [disbelief], learning to build weapons.
412. [defensive] He brought me a signed form that looked, [hesitant], legitimate enough, and the kid has real talent with his hands, [softer], probably gets that from you considering the precision work you do with, [measured], steam systems.
Character 1: [sharp] Don't try to flatter me while we're discussing how you've been, [accusatory], teaching my child behind my back.
413. Look, I understand you're upset but the truth is your son, [steady], has been learning valuable skills about mechanics, metallurgy, and, [earnest], craftsmanship that translate far beyond just, [thoughtful], firearms. [pause]
Character 1: [quieter] The problem isn't the skills, it's the, [struggling], deception and the fact that you never thought to, [bitter], verify that signature or call me to, [defeated], confirm. [exhales sharply]
414. [apologetic] You're absolutely right about that and I should've been more, [regretful], thorough, but once I started teaching him I saw how, [sincere], desperately he wanted to work with his hands like his, [gentle], father does.
Character 1: He could've learned that from me without the, [pained], guns involved, without learning how to create things that, [hollow], kill people, without going behind my, [breaking], back.
415. [thoughtful] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, he told me you're always, [careful], too busy with emergency calls and, umm, overtime shifts to actually teach him your, [sad], trade. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [stunned] Um, he actually said that, I mean, he thinks I don't have, [hurt], time for him?
416. [gentle] Well, er, yeah, he mentioned that you work, [sympathetic], sixty-hour weeks sometimes, umm, keeping the city's infrastructure running. [quietly]
Character 1: [broken] Um, well, I guess.
417. [measured] Listen, um, what if we, [hopeful], worked out something where, well, he learns from both of us, I mean, properly this time with, [earnest], real permission?
Character 1: [weary] Well, um, maybe.
418. [encouraging] Your boy has the patience for detail work that's, [impressed], rare in kids his age, and whether it's fitting pipes or fitting barrels, precision is, [thoughtful], precision.
Character 1: [considering] He gets home at four-thirty every day acting like he's accomplished something, [softer], real, and I haven't seen him that engaged since his mother, [voice catching], left. [long pause]
419. [compassionate] Kids need mentors who see their potential and sometimes that means, [understanding], multiple teachers showing them different paths to the same, [warm], values of craftsmanship and hard work. [softly]
Character 1: Well, I mean, maybe we could, [reluctant], work out a schedule or something, um, where I know exactly where he is and what he's learning.
420. [relieved] That's all I'm asking for, just a chance to, [sincere], keep teaching him the right way with your blessing and, [hopeful], involvement this time. [exhales]
Character 1: [imperious] So, um, you've been my kingdom's, [dismissive], chief historian for what, twenty years now, and yet you still, [irritated], insist on recording these tedious truths about, well, my predecessor's accomplishments?
421. [steady] Your Majesty, I mean, the historical records have been, [careful], maintained according to the sacred protocols established, um, four centuries ago when this kingdom was, [reverent], founded on principles of accurate documentation.
Character 1: [laughing coldly] Sacred protocols, well, how quaint that you think, [mocking], pieces of parchment written by dead men should, I mean, govern what my subjects learn about their, [commanding], rightful ruler's glorious achievements. [scoffs]
422. [defensive] Those protocols, um, have preserved the truth of our kingdom's history through, [firm], thirteen different dynasties, ensuring that, well, future generations understand where they came from.
Character 1: [arrogant] Truth is whatever I, [amused], declare it to be, and right now, um, I'm declaring that the records need to reflect how I, [grandiose], single-handedly saved this kingdom from the chaos my weak father, [venomous], left behind. [waves hand dismissively]
423. [troubled] But Your Majesty, um, the archives clearly show that the economic recovery began, [hesitant], under your father's reforms and the military victories were, well, won by General Marcus who you've since, [carefully], exiled.
Character 1: [dangerous] General Marcus was a traitor who, [cold], plotted against me, or have you forgotten that, um, convenient truth already?
424. [measured] I remember him receiving the highest military honors before his, [pained], sudden arrest on charges that were never publicly, [bitter], proven in any court.
Character 1: [furious] Um, how dare you?
425. [resolute] The records show that your reign began with, [somber], seventeen executions of former advisors, the dissolution of the council, and the, [heavy], burning of half the royal library. [long pause]
Character 1: [silky] Those books contained, [dismissive], dangerous ideas that poisoned minds against progress, um, much like the ideas you seem to harbor, old man.
426. [defiant] History will remember.
Character 1: Not if you're dead. [pause]
427. [calm] Then another historian will take my place, because the, [determined], truth has a way of surviving tyrants who think they can, [prophetic], rewrite reality to suit their vanity and eventually, [knowing], crumble into the very dust they tried to shape.
Character 1: [contemptuous] Perhaps, but um, I wonder if your precious protocols say anything about, [cruel], what happens to historians who refuse their king's direct commands, well, especially when their families live so, I mean, vulnerably in the capital?
428. [shaking] My daughter serves in your court as a, [breaking], scribe, my son trains with your guard, and my wife tends the royal, [defeated], gardens that your mother once loved. [voice cracking]
Character 1: [satisfied] Ah, there it is.
429. [quiet] Three days, Your Majesty.
Character 1: [curious] Three days for what, I mean, to rewrite four centuries of history according to my, [amused], specifications, or to say goodbye to your family before you choose your, [dark], principles over their lives? [chuckles darkly]
430. [broken] Three days to teach my apprentice where I've hidden the, [desperate], true records before I give you the forgeries you, [resigned], demand. [exhales slowly]
Character 1: [stunned] This burn pattern on the neck—I've seen this, [trembling], exact damage before in photos from the Riverside Arena, [barely breathing], the night of the fire.
431. [defensive] It's just, um, an old guitar that needs, [tense], fixing, so maybe we should, uh, stick to discussing the repair costs, you know?
Character 1: [shaking] You're him, aren't you—the one who, um, went back into that burning venue, [voice breaking], five times to pull people out before the whole stage collapsed, [choked up], and then just, er, vanished from the world. [long pause]
432. [harsh] Look, I don't know what, um, stories you've heard, but I'm just, [frustrated], a customer who needs a guitar fixed, and, well, that's all this is, [firm], okay? [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [quietly] My sister was one of the people you, [overwhelmed], carried out that night—she still has the scar on her arm from where you, [grateful], gripped her so tight to keep her from falling through the, [voice cracking], burning floor.
433. [pained] Please, I mean, just stop—I can't, [struggling], do this again, not here in some, um, guitar shop where I just wanted to, [desperate], get this thing repaired without anyone knowing who I, er, used to be. [groans]
Character 1: [whispered] She never forgot.
434. Every single night I still smell that, [haunted], smoke and hear those screams echoing through my dreams.
Character 1: [gentle] You saved forty-three people that night, [measured], and then disappeared because you couldn't handle being called a, [understanding], hero. [pause]
435. [bitter] Heroes don't leave seven people behind because the, [breaking], ceiling came down—heroes don't have to live with choosing who to, [anguished], save and who to let, [hollow], die.
Character 1: [firm] My sister told me about how you went back for that little girl even though your, [emotional], hands were already burned so badly you could barely, [intense], grip the door handles, and you still carried her out on your, [proud], back.
436. [exhausted] That little girl's mother was still, [heavy], inside when the whole thing came down—I can still see her, [haunted], face in the window.
Character 1: Stop punishing yourself.
437. You don't, um, understand what it's like to be treated like some kind of, well, saint when all I, er, did was what anyone would do, you know? [voice cracking]
Character 1: [soft] Um, well, anyone wouldn't.
438. I just wanted to play, um, music again without people, [raw], staring at me like I'm some kind of, er, monument to that awful night instead of just, [defeated], a person trying to move forward, you know? [sighs]
Character 1: [steady] Then let me fix this guitar so you can, [sincere], play again.
439. [vulnerable] Every time I try to play, um, my hands start, [shaking], trembling because they remember the heat, and I, well, can't make it through a single song anymore.
Character 1: We'll work on it together—no rush, [compassionate], no pressure.
440. [hopeful] Maybe if I could just, [uncertain], play one song again without seeing their faces, [yearning], without feeling that heat, then maybe I could finally, [desperate], forgive myself. [long pause]
441. Oh my God. Oh my— [gasp] it's actually there. Front page. [extremely happy] Right there with my photo and everything! I mean, um, this is the same idea that my own dad called— [bitter] what was it? "Financial suicide"? [laugh] Yeah, that's the one. 

[excited] And like, everyone at that startup meetup, they literally laughed when I pitched it! [speeding up] Remember Marcus? He said I should, you know, "maybe try something more realistic"— [mocking] more realistic! [belly laugh] God, I can't even—

[pause]

[warm] Mom's gonna cry when she sees this. She's, er, she's the only one who— [trailing off] [sniffle] Sorry, I just— [shaky voice] three years of everyone saying I was basically delusional, and now it's like—here's the thing, [confidently] I knew it would work. Deep down I always— [stuttering] I-I-I always knew.

[very quietly] But honestly? Some nights I almost quit. [long pause] Almost.

[delighted] They're calling it "revolutionary" in the article! Revolutionary! [laugh loudly] My crazy little idea! [passionate] And you know what? This is just the beginning. [smiling speaking] This is literally just the start of everything I— [gasp softly] everything we're gonna build.
442. [shaky voice] Oh God, they just—they literally just escorted Marcus out. With, um, a cardboard box. [pause] Twenty-three years he's been here, and they just... [very quietly] I should say something. I mean, I should, right? But like, what would I even—[anxious] the thing is, if I tell them now, they'll fire me too, and honestly, I can't lose this job. [sigh] My kid's tuition is due next month. 

[regretful] Marcus taught me everything, you know? Showed me how to, er, align the folding plates just right, how to listen for that clicking sound when the, um—[stuttering] when the b-binding gets jammed. He was so patient. [trailing off] And I just stood there while they blamed him for... 

[mumbling] I mean, it's not like I meant to override the safety settings. I was just, well, trying to speed up production because, hmm, everyone's been on my case about being slow. [upset] But Marcus specifically told me never to do that. He literally warned me, like, a hundred times. 

[very sad] His wife has cancer. Did I mention that? She's been—[whispering] God, what have I done? [pause] Maybe I could, I don't know, anonymously send them money or something? [crying while speaking] Except I barely have any money, that's the whole reason I can't—this is so fucked up.
443. [excited] You know how everyone always calls me the party person? Like, "Oh, call Jamie, they'll know what to do"—well, [chuckle] this time it actually mattered. [pause] When Sarah's mom asked me to organize her surprise graduation party, I was—honestly, I felt this pressure, but also [animated] everyone just jumped in! My whole network, you know? The DJ from last New Year's, that caterer from the block party, [quickly] even that guy who does balloon animals from my nephew's thing—they all said yes immediately. 

[warm] And when Sarah walked in... [trailing off] 

[short pause] God, her face just—she completely broke down. [smiling speaking] Happy tears everywhere, like ugly-crying into her mom's shoulder, and I'm standing there with my stupid party hat on, [laugh] holding this ridiculous banner I made at 2 AM, and suddenly [shaky voice] I'm crying too because... [sniffle]

[very slowly] It hit me that all these years of throwing random parties, staying up planning stupid themes—it was practice for this. [pause] For making someone feel that loved. [happy] Her mom grabbed my hand and whispered "thank you," and I just... [crying while speaking] yeah, that's when I lost it completely.
444. [shaky voice] My lawyer just called and, um, she said we—we actually did it. [pause] Not just won our case but like, the judge used the words "setting precedent" and I just... [sniffle] God, I keep thinking about all those other families who've been going through what we went through. [clearing throat] You know, when Emma got hurt at that daycare, I mean, I was so angry—[passionately] furious actually—that they'd been hiding their violations for years. And honestly, we almost didn't even sue because, well, it's exhausting, right? [laugh] But then I kept thinking about, er, the next kid who might... [trailing off] 

[warm] Anyway, the thing is, our attorney said this means that from now on, these facilities can't just, you know, sweep their inspection failures under the—[excited] oh my God, I'm actually crying about legal terminology here! [laugh loudly] But seriously, it's like, we didn't just get justice for Emma, we kind of... [very sincerely] we protected kids we'll never even meet. [pause] Their parents won't have to fight as hard as we did. [relieved] That's, um—that's something, isn't it? [happy] That's really something.
445. [shaky voice] God, I can't stop thinking about what almost happened today. Like, um, we were rigging the main stunt sequence—you know the one with the car flip—and honestly, I noticed something was off with the cable tension. [pause] Just... something didn't feel right.

So I called for a full stop. [anxious] And the AD was pissed, right? Because we're already behind schedule and, I mean, every minute costs thousands. But here's the thing—I implemented this double-check protocol after that incident in Vancouver last year, and it's like, [confidently], non-negotiable for me now.

Anyway, uh, when we ran the diagnostics, [gasp softly] the primary support beam had a hairline fracture. If we'd gone ahead with the stunt... Jesus. [very quietly] Three people would've been directly underneath when it failed.

The stunt coordinator just—he actually hugged me. [relieved] Said I saved lives today. And honestly, it's not about being a hero or whatever, it's just... [passionately] this is why we have protocols! This is why I'm such a pain in the ass about safety checks!

[warm] Tomorrow we're doing a full team debrief, and, well, I think everyone finally gets why I'm so obsessive about this stuff. [sigh] God, what a day.
446. I wasn't sure if I should even, um, send this email but I just—I had to tell you. [hesitantly] It's been what, like, five years since I took your creative writing class? And honestly, I don't think you realize what you did for me. I was so lost back then, you know? Just completely... [trailing off] I mean, my parents wanted me to be an engineer, and I was basically failing everything because I hated it so much. [emotional] But then in your class, when you, uh, pulled me aside after that first story I wrote? The one about my grandmother? [pause] You said I had a voice worth sharing. Nobody had ever—[shaky voice] sorry, I'm getting kind of emotional here. But like, that conversation literally changed everything. I switched majors the next week. [laugh] My parents freaked out, obviously. But here's the thing—I just published my second novel. [very excited] Can you believe that? And it's actually doing well! I'm supporting myself as a writer, which is just... [warm] None of this would've happened without you believing in me when I couldn't even, you know, believe in myself. So, um, thank you. [very sincerely] Really, thank you for seeing something in me that I didn't even know was there.
447. [gasp] The White House just called. The actual White House. [pause] They want—they want my 1982 Bordeaux for the state dinner with the French President. [very excited] I can't stop shaking, like, my hands won't—[laugh] thirty-seven years I've been saving that vintage. Thirty-seven! [long pause] Dad would've been so proud. He always said, [emotional], "Sophie, that wine will know when it's time." [sniffle] I thought he was being, um, poetic or whatever but—[extremely happy] THE PRESIDENTIAL DINNER! 

[whispering] I keep saying it out loud to make it real. [clearing throat] They said the sommelier specifically requested it after reading that article about our family vineyard. [proudly] Four generations of winemakers and now—[gasp softly] oh God, what if something happens during transport? [anxious] What if the temperature fluctuates or—no, no, stop it Sophie. [confidently] This is our moment. 

[warm] Mom used to say our grapes grew different because we sang to them. [chuckle] I thought she was crazy but, I mean, here we are. [very sincerely] A wine we bottled with our own hands is going to be poured at the White House. [pause] I need to call everyone. [delighted] I need to call EVERYONE!
448. [warm] You know, when Jake first rolled into the shop—Vietnam vet, lost his right arm overseas—I could see it in his eyes, that look of, um, "I used to be somebody." [pause] He's standing there holding this old ball bag, and he goes, [very sad] "Can you even drill a ball for someone like me?" 

[passionately] And I'm thinking, of course I can! I mean, that's literally what I do—I make the sport work for people. So we spent, what, [slowly] three hours that first day? Testing grips, adjusting the thumb pitch, moving the finger holes way left to compensate for his, uh, his throwing motion now. [excited] The precision work, it's like—it's like sculpting, honestly. Every sixteenth of an inch matters.

[chuckle] He threw gutter balls for weeks. Just... gutter after gutter. But he kept coming back, and I kept tweaking. [empathetically] Then last Tuesday, he rolls his first strike in fifteen years, and— [gasp softly] God, he just breaks down crying right there on lane seven. [crying while speaking] I'm standing behind the counter trying not to lose it myself because... [relieved] that's why I do this. That's exactly why I do this.
449. [gasp loudly] Oh my God, I—what is all this? [confused] I don't understand, um, how did you even know it was my birthday? We barely... I mean, we've lived together for like eight months and we've maybe had three actual conversations? [very quietly] I thought you didn't even know my last name.

[pause] 

Wait, is that—did you make my favorite cake? How did you... [shaky voice] I mentioned that exactly once when my mom called and I was in the kitchen. You were wearing headphones, I didn't think you could hear—

[emotional] This is really for me? All these people, they're actually here for me? [laugh] I've been eating cereal alone in my room every birthday since I moved here because I thought, well, I assumed you just tolerated me being here, you know? Like I was just the person who paid half the rent and sometimes left dishes in the sink.

[crying while speaking] You got streamers in my favorite color. You remembered I hate balloons but love streamers. I can't—

[very sincerely] I've been so lonely, and this whole time you were actually paying attention? [happy] This is the nicest thing anyone's done for me in... God, I don't even know how long. Thank you. Really, just—thank you.
450. [frustrated] I can't—I literally can't believe they just sat there and, um, dismissed everything. [pause] Three months of data, you know? Three months of documented cardiac events, and they're just... [bitter] "Not statistically significant," they said. [sarcastic] Right. Tell that to the seventeen people who ended up in the ER last month. 

[angry] I mean, honestly, what am I even doing here? [shaky voice] We're supposed to be protecting people, that's like—that's literally our job, and instead we're, what, [mocking] "managing risk profiles"? [disgusted grunt] Sorry, I mean, protecting shareholder value.

[quietly] The thing is, uh, I know what happens next. [anxious] They'll push this through FDA approval anyway, and then... [trail off] God, I keep thinking about that woman's chart, the one with the, er, the two kids. [very sad] Twenty-eight years old. 

[sigh] Maybe I should've been more, I don't know, politically savvy about it? [regretful] Instead of just, you know, presenting the raw data like some kind of... [pause] But that's the thing—the data speaks for itself! [passionate] Or it should, anyway. 

[exhausted] I guess I could, um, leak it? [nervous laugh] Jesus, listen to me. [whispering] Five years at this company and now I'm thinking about becoming a whistleblower.
Character 1: [confused] I wasn't expecting to find anyone here at three AM, especially not, [exhausted], you sleeping on the break room couch with all your stuff in, [quietly], bags around you like some kind of makeshift bedroom setup.
451. [hesitantly] Look, um, I can explain this whole situation, I mean, it's not what you, [embarrassed], probably think it is, and well, I was going to find a better solution but, [shaky voice], things have been really complicated lately. [pause]
Character 1: [warm] Well, um, I'm not judging or anything, I mean, we've worked together for, [concerned], four years and clearly something serious is, [softly], happening if you're living in our break room instead of, you know, going home.
452. [bitter] My landlord decided to sell the building to developers who are, [frustrated], turning everything into luxury condos that cost three times what I was paying.
Character 1: [empathetically] Jesus, um, how long have you been, like, sleeping here, because I mean, [worried], the night security does rounds and if management finds out they'll, [trailing off], definitely fire you for this kind of thing...
453. [very quietly] Um, about three weeks now, and, well, I've been careful to pack everything up before the, [anxious], day shift arrives and nobody's noticed because, you know, I still shower at the gym down the street.
Character 1: The plastic molds we run all night generate enough, [tired], heat to keep this place warm but that can't be good for your health.
454. Well, um, it's better than sleeping in my car during winter, and, [grimly], at least here I have access to a microwave and running water.
Character 1: [sympathetic] Look, um, my brother just moved out of my spare room, so, well, I have space if you need somewhere, [gently], temporary while you figure things out.
455. [surprised] You'd seriously offer that to someone who's been, [emotionally], secretly squatting in the workplace like some kind of, [laughing nervously], industrial vagrant?
Character 1: Well, I mean, you're not some stranger, you're the person who, [firmly], covered my shifts when my dad was dying and never once, um, asked for anything in return.
456. [tearfully] That's different though, that was just being a decent, [trembling], coworker and friend. [long pause]
Character 1: [kindly] Maybe this is my chance to be decent too, because watching you, [concerned], try to maintain dignity while literally homeless at work is, [slowly], breaking my heart.
457. [relieved] God, I've been so scared someone would find out and, [ashamed], report me to HR, but instead you're offering to, [gratefully], actually help me get back on my feet.
Character 1: [gently] The blow molding machines will still be here tomorrow, but you need a real, [sincerely], bed and a door you can lock tonight.
458. [crying while speaking] I don't even know what to say except that working these, [wearily], overnight shifts has been the only stable thing while everything else, [voice breaking], fell apart around me.
Character 1: [determined] Well, um, pack up your stuff because, I mean, we're leaving early and you're coming home with me before the, [firmly], morning crew shows up. [sigh]
459. [whispering] Um, I've been so tired of pretending everything's fine, and, well, carrying this secret alone has been, [heavily], exhausting beyond anything the actual work ever was, you know, [emotionally], more than these twelve-hour shifts could ever be.
Character 1: [reassuringly] Hey, um, everyone needs help sometimes, and I mean, you've been standing next to me at these machines long enough for me to know you'd, [warmly], do the same for me.
460. [hopefully] Maybe when this is all over we can laugh about the time I turned the break room into, [shakily], a studio apartment, but right now I just feel, [overwhelmed], grateful that you found me instead of someone else who might not, [quietly], understand what desperation looks like.
Character 1: [somber] Um, I need to speak with you about something that's, [quietly], been affecting my kind for months now, though, well, I realize this conversation may be difficult for you to understand.
461. [confused] Um, your kind?
Character 1: [hesitantly] Well, I feed on the deceased, and lately, er, something in the bodies has been, [shaky voice], making us violently ill, something that, [whispering], tastes chemical and wrong. [pause]
462. [shocked] You're telling me you consume human, [slowly], remains and you've come to me for medical advice about contamination?
Character 1: [bitter] I mean, we've existed alongside your kind for centuries without incident, um, but now the bodies from certain morgues are, [anxious], poisoned with something that burns through our systems like, [frustrated], acid.
463. [calculated] The morgues you mentioned are all, [stern], near pharmaceutical disposal sites where we've documented improper waste management causing, [worried], groundwater contamination that could theoretically accumulate in, [trailing off], human tissue...
Character 1: Well, um, three of my bloodline have already died from, [crying while speaking], consuming these tainted corpses, and I mean, we don't know how to, [desperately], stop it because we don't understand your chemicals or, [loudly], why they're suddenly everywhere!
464. [empathetically] Look, umm, I monitor drug safety for living patients, but, [nervous], what you're describing sounds like accumulated pharmaceutical metabolites that weren't properly filtered.
Character 1: [angry] So, er, your industry poisoned the dead without even, [bitterly], knowing creatures like us exist, without considering that, [exhausted], death isn't the end of the body's purpose for, well, everyone? [sigh]
465. [apologetic] I had no idea anything, [very quietly], fed on human remains in modern times, but if what you're saying is true then, [regretful], we've inadvertently created a toxic chain that's, [monotone], killing an entire species.
Character 1: [desperate] Umm, can you help us identify which bodies are safe, or, [pleading], at least tell us which chemicals to avoid, I mean?
466. [thoughtful] The contamination patterns follow specific drug disposal sites where, [carefully], certain antipsychotics and chemotherapy agents were illegally dumped, creating, [whispering loudly], bioaccumulation in surrounding cemetery grounds.
Character 1: [relieved] Then there's a pattern we can follow to avoid the, [hopeful], poisoned feeding grounds and perhaps find areas that remain untainted.
467. I can provide you with contamination maps showing, [reluctant], pharmaceutical waste sites, though sharing this data with a, [uncomfortable], ghoul wasn't exactly covered in my ethics training.
Character 1: [grateful] Your discomfort is understandable, but consider that we're, [sincerely], an indicator species for a contamination problem that will eventually affect the living too.
468. [serious] The groundwater contamination spreading from these sites is already showing, [alarmed], elevated pharmaceutical levels in nearby wells, which means this problem extends beyond just your, [pause], unusual dietary needs.
Character 1: [determined] Then perhaps our survival instincts can serve as an early, [grimly], warning system for dangers your monitoring systems haven't detected yet.
469. [curious] Well, how many?
Character 1: [sad] Seventeen of us remain in this city, down from, [very melancholic], forty-three just six months ago.
470. [resolved] I'll compile the data tonight, and um, meet you tomorrow at the old cemetery gate, er, where we can review which areas are safe and, [warm], maybe prevent more deaths—both for your kind and, [very sincerely], eventually for mine. [deep breath]
Character 1: [confrontational] Stop right there.
471. I don't know what you're, [panicked], talking about and I really need to get to class right now. [nervous laugh]
Character 1: [furious] I know you've been, um, [shaking], following me for weeks and selling those, [disgusted], photos to tabloids saying I'm the real celebrity when, well, [bitter], you know damn well I'm just trying to make a living.
472. [defensive] Look, you dress exactly, [desperate], like them and hang out at all the same places so what's the, [trembling], difference really?
Character 1: [hurt] The difference is that my entire career as a lookalike gets, [voice cracking], destroyed when people find out those aren't real celebrity photos. [sighs heavily]
473. [guilty] Well, um, I needed the money for tuition and, [ashamed], nobody was getting hurt since, er, [quiet], the magazines didn't seem to care anyway. [mumbles]
Character 1: [exhausted] You've already cost me three, [defeated], corporate event bookings because clients think I'm some kind of, [hollow], fraud who stages fake paparazzi shots for, [disgusted], attention. [long pause]
474. I mean, I didn't realize it would, [regretful], affect your actual job opportunities like that, you know?
Character 1: [pleading] Do you understand that impersonating celebrities at parties and, [breaking], charity events is literally how I pay my rent and that your little, [angry], side hustle is taking food off my, [desperate], table?
475. Okay, um, maybe we could, [calculating], work something out where I pay you a cut or, [nervous], we could even stage better photos together since, well, [hopeful], you're really good at the whole impersonation thing. [trails off]
Character 1: [incredulous] So, um, now you want me to be, [sarcastic], complicit in defrauding the same magazines that are, well, [frustrated], already ruining my reputation?
476. [desperate] Um, wait, I mean—
Character 1: [firm] I've already contacted my lawyer about this and, um, [measured], she says what you're doing constitutes fraud and harassment which means, [serious], you could lose a lot more than just your, well, [pointed], part-time tuition money if I press charges.
477. [panicking] Please, um, don't do that because I'll, [frantic], delete everything right now, I mean, all the photos and accounts.
Character 1: [cold] You need to, um, write a signed confession about what you've been doing and, [calculating], send retractions to every outlet you've sold to or, well, [threatening], I'm going straight to the police station after this conversation, you know?
478. Jesus, okay, um, I'll do whatever you want but please understand that I was, [broken], just trying to survive school and I never meant to, er, [tearful], destroy someone else's life in the process. [voice breaks]
Character 1: [tired] Just fix this.
479. [resigned] I'll go to the magazines today and tell them, [defeated], everything about how I've been lying to them and, um, [exhausted], make sure they know you had nothing to do with it, I mean, any of it.
Character 1: [warning] If I see one more photo or even hear a, [stern], whisper about this continuing, there won't be a, [dark], second chance for you to make this, [final], right.
480. [sincere] I understand completely and I'm genuinely, [remorseful], sorry for everything I've put you through. [sighs]
Character 1: [shocked] Sarah, is that you sleeping in that, [concerned], Honda with the broken tail light because I saw movement when I, [gentle], pulled into the parking lot this morning?
481. [defensive] Mrs. Henderson, please don't call anyone because I'm just, [embarrassed], waiting for the school to open so Katie can, [desperate], get to her kindergarten class and I promise we'll be, [voice breaking], gone before anyone notices.
Character 1: [firm] You were one of my brightest students ten years ago and now you're, [pained], living in your car with a five-year-old which means something went, [heavy], terribly wrong.
482. [bitter] Well, um, you know, life doesn't always follow the lesson plans we, [hollow], studied in your classroom, I mean, sometimes it just, [defeated], falls apart. [sighs]
Character 1: [soft] I remember, um, how you used to write these beautiful essays about, well, [nostalgic], changing the world and making a difference, you know?
483. [angry] Those essays didn't prepare me for a husband who, [trembling], emptied our bank account and disappeared or landlords who don't care that, [broken], you work three jobs but still can't make rent when your daughter gets, [crying], sick and medical bills pile up.
Character 1: [steady] The school has resources and programs that could, [encouraging], help you get back on your feet if you'd let me make some calls.
484. [resistant] I don't need charity from the school where my daughter has to, [proud], pretend everything's normal while we wash up in gas station bathrooms.
Character 1: Sarah, this isn't charity, it's what communities do when someone's, [warm], drowning and too proud to reach for the life preserver right, [urgent], in front of them.
485. [wavering] Um, I just, well, I don't know how to explain to Katie that, [ashamed], her mom can't even provide a real home anymore, you know?
Character 1: Katie needs, um, I mean, a safe place more than she needs you to, [wise], be perfect, well, and pride won't keep her warm tonight.
486. [exhausted] Mrs. Henderson, um, I'm so tired of fighting and, well, [breaking down], pretending that tomorrow will somehow be different when I know, you know, [defeated], it won't be. [long pause]
Character 1: [determined] Well, um, tonight will be different because you're both staying at, [firm], my guest house and I won't hear any arguments about it, I mean, [maternal], some battles you don't fight alone, you know? [resolute]
487. [stunned] You barely know me anymore and you're offering to, [disbelieving], open your home to someone who failed at everything you, [emotional], taught was possible.
Character 1: [gentle] I know that the seventeen-year-old who cried in my classroom about, [remembering], wanting to be a social worker is still in there somewhere, and I know Katie deserves to see her, [hopeful], mom rebuild rather than just survive.
488. [vulnerable] What if I mess this up too because I've gotten so good at, [fearful], disappointing people who believe in me that it feels like, [broken whisper], the only thing I know how to do anymore, [shaking], even when I try my hardest?
Character 1: [fierce] Then we try again.
489. [crying softly] Um, well, I don't even know what to say except, you know, [grateful], thank you for seeing something in me that I, [overwhelmed], lost a long time ago, I mean, thank you.
Character 1: [tender] Sarah, um, I've watched hundreds of students graduate but, well, [emotional], I never stop wondering what happens when life gets hard, and I mean, [determined], I refuse to let you become one of the ones who just, [voice breaking], disappears. [firmly]
490. [quiet] Maybe Katie won't have to remember this time when, [hopeful], her mom hit rock bottom but instead the morning when, [strengthening], someone reminded us that we're worth saving even when we, [tearful], can't save ourselves. [exhales deeply]
Character 1: [warm] Well, um, Senator Mitchell, I've been watching your, [amused], healthcare bill struggle through committees for, er, months now, and I mean, you seem rather stuck.
491. Who are you and how did you, [suspicious], get past security into my private office at, um, I mean, three in the morning when the building should be, [stern], completely locked down?
Character 1: [playful] Security measures are more of a, [chuckle], suggestion for someone like me, though I appreciate the, [confidently], theatrical midnight setting your government buildings provide with all these, [whispering], shadows and mahogany.
492. [sharp] I'm calling security right now unless you, [frustrated], explain exactly what you want and how you, [loudly], know about my bill.
Character 1: Your bill needs seventeen more votes to pass and you've been, [slowly], losing sleep calculating which colleagues might flip if you offer the right compromises.
493. [anxious] Look, um, whatever lobbyist group or, er, foreign interest you represent, I mean, I don't take meetings like this, especially not with someone who, [trembling], breaks into federal buildings.
Character 1: [counseling] I represent interests far older than any government, Senator, and I can, [gently], guarantee your bill passes next week intact. [pause]
494. Nobody can guarantee that, um, not even the President, and, well, I've been in politics long enough to know that, [bitter], promises like yours come with, I mean, prices I can't afford to pay.
Character 1: [very quietly] Seventeen votes.
495. What exactly would you, [hesitantly], want in return for this impossible guarantee, assuming you could even, [nervous], deliver on such an absurd claim, which you, [sarcastic], obviously cannot?
Character 1: [formal] All I need is for you to, [empathetically], vote 'no' on a small agricultural subsidy amendment next month that, [curious], nobody will even remember existed.
496. [defensive] Agricultural subsidies affect thousands of farmers in my state so there's nothing, [angry], small about them, and besides, you still haven't explained who or, [shaky voice], what you actually are. [sigh]
Character 1: You already know, um, what I am, Senator Mitchell, because, er, deep down you've always suspected that, [whispering loudly], entities like me exist when deals seem too perfect and, well, circumstances align too conveniently.
497. [regretful] So, um, you're telling me that, er, I mean, you're actually suggesting that you're some kind of, [exhausted], supernatural entity here to make a deal?
Character 1: [excited] Um, I prefer 'alternative negotiator' but yes, I mean, I'm offering you everything you've, [passionately], worked twenty years to achieve, er, universal healthcare for your constituents.
498. Even if I believed this insanity, which I, [firmly], don't, accepting help from something like you would, [horrified], corrupt everything good that bill represents and turn it into a, [very sad], mockery of public service. [long pause]
Character 1: [sincerely] The forty-three thousand people who'll die without coverage this year won't care, [melancholic], about the metaphysical origins of their salvation, only that someone finally, [soft-spoken], fought hard enough to save them. [clearing throat]
499. [conflicted] That's exactly the kind of, [manipulative], logic that makes these deals so dangerous.
Character 1: [reassuring] Senator, the amendment I mentioned affects, [matter-of-factly], GMO labeling requirements for exported corn, nothing that touches human lives directly.
500. [resigned] Well, um, if this is real, and I mean, I still don't believe it is but, er, if you're truly offering this, then I need to, [thoughtfully], know what happens to that agricultural amendment and, well, why it matters to you so much.
501. [upset] Five years. Um, five whole years of my life, and they just—they tell me in a ten-minute meeting that it's over. [bitter] "Budget constraints," they said. Like, as if I don't know what that means—it means the donors found something shinier, you know? [pause] 

I mean, honestly, what about the kids in our after-school program? Hmm? What happens to them now? [shaky voice] Maria was finally starting to open up about her home situation, and Carlos just got into that mentorship program we fought so hard to—[sigh] God, this is just... 

[frustrated] The thing is, er, I knew the grants were getting harder to secure, but I thought—I guess I thought we had more time. Like, we literally just renovated the community space. [very quietly] All those late nights writing proposals, basically living in that office... [pause]

[anxious] So now what? I'm thirty-seven, and uh, my entire career has been at this one nonprofit. My mortgage is due next week. [sad] And honestly, it's not even about me—well, okay, partly it is—but those families, they're gonna show up Monday and find the doors locked. [crying while speaking] I can't even call them all personally because, um, they took my work phone already. 

[very sad] Five years of building something that actually mattered, and it's just... gone.
Character 1: [stunned] Marcus, is that, um, really you standing there in that, [disbelief], expensive suit looking like you own the world, I mean, after all these years?
502. [shocked] Oh my God, Tommy, I, well, I can't believe it's, [breaking], actually you after twelve years of wondering what happened, you know.
Character 1: [defensive] I've been right here in the city, [bitter], watching you from a distance sometimes when you'd walk past, never, [quiet], recognizing the guy who used to be your best friend.
503. [guilty] I looked for you, I mean, after you disappeared from school I, [desperate], searched everywhere but your family moved and nobody would, [cracking], tell me where you went, you know.
Character 1: [soft] Well, um, things got complicated after Dad died and, [heavy], Mom couldn't keep it together, so I, well, [trailing off], ended up taking care of myself since I was sixteen, you know.
504. Tommy, I'm celebrating my, [excited], promotion tonight but seeing you here makes everything feel so, [conflicted], empty and meaningless because we were supposed to, [nostalgic], conquer the world together. [sighs]
Character 1: [wistful] Yeah, well, we were going to be, um, business partners by thirty, remember, [laughing sadly], millionaires by forty with matching Ferraris and, I mean, [quiet], beach houses next door to each other. [long pause]
505. [determined] Listen, forget the party because I'm, [urgent], taking you somewhere warm where we can actually, [caring], talk and figure out how to get you back on your, [hopeful], feet again.
Character 1: [resistant] Marcus, um, I don't need your, [proud], charity or pity just because you, well, [firm], made it big and I'm sleeping behind the, you know, [quieter], dumpsters near Fifth Street.
506. [frustrated] This isn't charity, um, this is me refusing to, [emotional], walk away from my brother again, I mean, after twelve years of regret.
Character 1: You have no idea what, um, [pained], I've been through or who I've, well, [ashamed], become just to survive out here, you know. [voice breaks]
507. [gentle] Then help me understand because the Tommy I, [earnest], knew was the strongest person who taught me how to, [warm], never give up.
Character 1: [tearful] That Tommy died somewhere between the third shelter closing and, um, [broken], the first winter sleeping outside when I realized, well, [hollow], nobody was coming to save me, you know. [crying softly]
508. [choked up] Well, um, I'm here now. [sniffles]
Character 1: [vulnerable] The party people inside are probably, [bitter], wondering where their golden boy went, missing you buying, [sarcastic], rounds and telling your success stories while I'm just another, [defeated], invisible person they step around.
509. Those people don't even, [dismissive], know my real name or that I grew up poor too.
Character 1: [surprised] You still carry that old photo of us from, [emotional], eighth grade graduation in your wallet even though you're living this, [gesturing], whole different life now where people like me, [quiet], don't exist.
510. [firm] Tommy, I mean, I've carried that photo through, [passionate], every single day hoping somehow I'd find you again, well, and here we are. [voice shaking]
Character 1: Here we are. [whispers]
511. Come inside with me right now and let's, [inviting], show everyone that real friendship survives anything, even, [confident], twelve years of silence and pain. [extends hand]
Character 1: [hollow] They're all dead.
512. [measured] I understand you've experienced a significant, [careful], setback but let's focus on what you can, [probing], control moving forward.
Character 1: [bitter] Control—that's rich considering I'm supposed to have these, [mocking], divine powers that everyone keeps saying will, [exhausted], save the world. [laughs darkly]
513. [curious] Tell me about these expectations that others have, [gentle], placed on you.
Character 1: [frantic] Well, um, the prophecy says I'm supposed to, [trembling], defeat the darkness but every time I try, I mean, more people die and I just, [breaking], freeze up completely.
514. [analytical] So, um, what I'm hearing is that you're, [shifting], carrying not just the weight of this prophecy but also, well, the guilt of those who've been lost while you're still, [softer], learning what your role actually means.
Character 1: [angry] Learning—I don't have time to, [desperate], learn when villages are burning and children are, [voice cracking], screaming for someone to save them while I stand there, [defeated], paralyzed.
515. [firm] Um, even chosen ones need to, well, develop their abilities through practice and failure. [pause]
Character 1: The oracle said I'd know what to, [confused], do when the time came but all I feel is this, [anguished], crushing emptiness. [sighs heavily]
516. [strategic] Perhaps the prophecy isn't about you having all the, [thoughtful], answers but about you finding the courage to act despite, [emphatic], not knowing—that's what real leadership looks like, [steady], actually.
Character 1: [scoffing] Leadership—I can't even lead myself out of, [bitter], bed most mornings. [groans]
517. [direct] Well, um, that's exactly where we start then—not with, [pragmatic], saving the world but with getting up tomorrow morning and, I mean, taking one deliberate action, however small it, [encouraging], might be.
Character 1: [skeptical] You want me to forget about the dark armies gathering while I, [sarcastic], work on my morning routine like some kind of, [incredulous], self-help cliché?
518. [intense] Um, I want you to understand that your power, well, isn't separate from your humanity—it's, [revelatory], amplified by it, and right now your humanity is, [compassionate], wounded and needs tending. [softly]
Character 1: [vulnerable] I mean, what if I'm not actually the chosen one and, well, everyone's dying for nothing because they, [terrified], believed in the wrong person who just, um, happened to have a birthmark that looked like, [hollow], some ancient symbol? [voice breaking]
519. [certain] The fact that you're questioning this shows more wisdom than blind, [knowing], faith ever could—true chosen ones always doubt themselves, [profound], paradoxically. [chuckles sadly]
Character 1: Well, I keep having these dreams where the darkness, um, speaks to me and says we're, [disturbed], the same—that I'm just pretending to be light but, I mean, deep down I'm as empty and, [horrified], consuming as it is.
520. Um, dreams often reveal our deepest fears rather than, [clinical], truth—what matters is what you choose to, [forceful], do with that fear.
Character 1: I mean, what if choosing means more people die because, well, I choose wrong—what if my hesitation is actually, [desperate], wisdom and my action would be the thing that, um, destroys everything? [cries softly]
521. [resolute] Then, well, at least you'll have chosen, and that's, [fierce], infinitely more powerful than letting fear choose for you.
Character 1: [steady] I brought the trust documents you requested but watching you, [trembling], tear down our childhood home makes me wonder if, [breaking], Dad would have wanted his legacy reduced to, [hollow], rubble and permits. [long pause]
522. [defensive] Every beam in this house holds, [bitter], memories of his disappointment when I chose engineering over law, every wall echoes with, [cracking], arguments about wasted potential, but you wouldn't understand because you were always, [resentful], the perfect daughter.
Character 1: [soft] Well, um, being perfect meant never getting to, [exhausted], fail or experiment or dream beyond what he expected, and I mean, [envious], watching you rebel even if it hurt was like, you know, [wistful], watching someone else live the life I was too afraid to want.
523. The revolutionary housing project I'm building here will, um, [proud], shelter fifty families who could never afford homes otherwise, which is, I mean, [measured], more than Dad ever did with his hoarded wealth, you know.
Character 1: [careful] The trust stipulates that both beneficiaries must, [clinical], agree to any demolition of family property, which means legally you, [firm], need my signature before another wall comes down, and we both know I could, [threatening], stop this today.
524. [weary] So, um, are you here as my sister who used to, [nostalgic], build blanket forts with me in the attic, or, well, as the trust officer who needs to, you know, enforce Dad's rules from beyond the grave?
Character 1: [struggling] I'm here as someone who, um, [lost], doesn't know how to be either anymore because being your sister means, well, [searching], betraying my duties and being the trust officer means, you know, [torn], betraying the only family I have left, I mean.
525. [gentle] Remember when we carved our initials, [tender], into that oak beam in the basement?
Character 1: It's still there beneath, um, [choked], seventeen coats of paint. [crying softly]
526. [hesitant] Well, I mean, I've been cutting around that beam for three days because, [vulnerable], I couldn't bring myself to destroy the only proof that we were once, um, [aching], close enough to share secrets and dreams before Dad's money and expectations, you know, [heavy], tore us apart. [sighs deeply]
Character 1: [resolved] Um, what if we saved that beam and incorporated it into, [hopeful], your new building somewhere, as like a cornerstone or, well, [brightening], something that honors where we came from while still, you know, [warming], letting you build something better?
527. That would mean you'd have to, [surprised], sign the papers. [pause]
Character 1: [quiet] Well, I already signed them this morning, um, before I came here because I realized, you know, holding onto this house means holding onto his control over us.
528. [stunned] Then why did you, um, [confused], let me think you might stop the demolition, I mean, why put us both through this?
Character 1: [sincere] Because I needed to know if destroying this house meant, [searching], destroying us too.
529. [emotional] You know, um, every family that moves into these homes will see that beam with our initials, [overwhelmed], and maybe they'll carve their own stories into it, and well, [hopeful], that feels like the legacy Dad never understood how to build. [voice breaking]
Character 1: [whispered] Um, yeah.
530. It doesn't.
Character 1: [firm] I want to invest my portion of the trust into, well, [determined], your project, if you'll let me, you know.
531. [softening] Um, that would make you my business partner, which, I mean, [contemplative], might be easier than learning how to be siblings again, you know.
Character 1: So, um, I guess we're finally, [tense], sitting across from each other after, well, three years of not, [bitter], speaking at family dinners.
532. [cold] Your company's valuation is interesting, though I have to say, [dismissive], the fundamentals aren't quite what corporate was expecting.
Character 1: [defensive] Oh, the fundamentals aren't, [incredulous], what you expected? Since when did you become such an, [mocking], expert on creative ventures anyway?
533. [sharp] Um, since always, actually.
Character 1: [sarcastic] Right, of course.
534. Well, um, sure.
Character 1: [frustrated] You know what's fascinating is how you can sit there, [voice rising], pretending this is just business when we both, [trembling], know exactly what this is, [quieter], really about.
535. [measured] I'm, uh, evaluating your company based on, [clinical], its merit and market position, not on, um, whatever personal narrative you're constructing here. [clears throat]
Character 1: Personal narrative? That's, [laughs bitterly], rich coming from someone who literally told Dad I'd never amount to anything.
536. That was five years ago and completely, [uncomfortable], taken out of context which you'd know if you'd bothered to ask.
Character 1: [quiet] Well, I mean, it's hard to ask when someone, [hurt], won't return your calls for, um, two straight years after Mom's funeral.
537. Um, well, okay.
Character 1: [resigned] Look, I know we're both, um, professionals here and I'm trying to, [steadying], keep this about the business but it's hard when—
538. [cutting in] Then let's keep it professional because frankly, [harsh], your emotional appeals won't change the fact that your burn rate is, [precise], unsustainable. [sighs]
Character 1: [controlled] Every startup has challenges in the early stages, and, um, if you actually looked at our, [pointed], user engagement metrics instead of just the spreadsheets—
539. [dismissive] User engagement doesn't pay bills and, well, your runway is, um, what, maybe six months at this rate? [pauses]
Character 1: [quiet anger] That's exactly right.
540. [softer] Despite what you think, I'm not here to, [hesitant], destroy what you've built, I'm actually trying to, [struggling], help you see the reality before it's too, [trailing off], late.
Character 1: [exhausted] Um, help me? Really?
541. Yes, because whether you believe it or not, [conflicted], I've always wanted you to succeed, even when we, [voice breaking], weren't speaking.
Character 1: [quiet] I wouldn't have called if it wasn't, [hesitant], an actual emergency but there's these old glass bottles with, [nervous], skull labels that are starting to leak and the demolition crew, [trailing off], comes tomorrow morning.
542. [professional] Theater chemicals from the forties can be, [concerned], incredibly unstable especially if they've been stored improperly for, [shifting], decades in a damp basement. [sighs quietly]
Character 1: Well, um, I remember you always said, [cherishing], never to move unknown chemicals without proper ventilation so, er, I've kept everyone out but, I mean, [worried], I need your expertise here.
543. [careful] Um, describe the bottles—are they, like, amber or clear glass, and, well, what exactly is the, [focused], consistency of whatever's leaking out?
Character 1: [soft] Some are amber, um, with these handwritten labels I can barely, [squinting], read—pyro-something, and, er, there's this white crystalline stuff that, you know, looks like it's growing on the cork stoppers.
544. That's likely picric acid which becomes, [alarmed], explosive when it dries out, and those crystals are, [urgent], incredibly shock-sensitive—don't touch anything else.
Character 1: God, um, this is exactly why I, well, needed you here because, [grateful], you always knew how to keep me from accidentally, er, blowing myself up with my theatrical ambitions, you know?
545. You still have that habit of, [fond], collecting dangerous things without reading the warning labels first, [gentle], just like with those antique flash pots that nearly burned down our, [catching self], your apartment.
Character 1: [vulnerable] Um, I kept meaning to tell you that, like, [regretful], I still have that fire extinguisher you bought me, you know, mounted right by the workshop door.
546. The red one with the, [remembering], note about checking the gauge monthly that you, [sad smile], probably never actually check.
Character 1: [defensive] I check it sometimes, when I'm, [quieter], thinking about how you used to worry about me working late with all those, [withdrawn], flammable paints and solvents.
547. [careful] Well, um, worrying about you became a, like, [bitter], full-time job that I apparently wasn't very good at.
Character 1: You were perfect at it—I was just, [pained], terrible at being worried about, at letting myself be, [struggling], cared for like that without feeling like I was losing, [voice breaking], something essential about myself.
548. [quiet] So, um, we should probably call the hazmat team because, well, [practical], this is beyond what we can safely handle ourselves, and, er, [softer], I don't want you getting hurt.
Character 1: [tender] Even after everything, you're still, [cherishing], protecting me from my own recklessness just like when we were, [wistful], together.
549. Some habits are harder to, [vulnerable], break than others, especially when they involve, [struggling], keeping people we care about safe from, [very quiet], preventable disasters.
Character 1: [hopeful] Well, um, after we deal with these chemicals, I mean, maybe we could, like, [nervous], get that coffee you always said we should get, er, when things were less complicated.
550. [surprised] Things are never less complicated with us, [fond], they just become different shades of complicated that we, [considering], either choose to navigate or not.
Character 1: [determined] Then let's choose to, [steady], navigate them this time because honestly I'm tired of, [emotional], pretending that calling you today wasn't also an, [admission], excuse to hear your voice again.
551. [moved] I've been carrying that hazmat certification in my wallet for, um, two years hoping you'd, well, [confession], need my help with something dangerous enough to justify calling me, you know, [soft laugh], instead of just calling. [long pause]
Character 1: Mrs. Chen, um, I need to ask you about the fire at the, [careful], Meridian Gallery last Tuesday night because our records show you were, [probing], one of the last people to leave the area, well, before everything went up in flames.
552. Um, well, I don't know anything.
Character 1: [stern] The security footage shows you standing at your window for, [suspicious], forty-three minutes watching something across the street, and that's, [measured], unusual behavior for someone who claims they saw nothing. [pause]
553. [defensive] Sometimes I can't sleep and I just, [nervous], look outside at the lights, there's nothing, [trembling], criminal about insomnia or watching the street from my own home.
Character 1: [pressing] Well, um, the thing is your neighbor mentioned hearing you, [concerned], crying that night, I mean, sobbing actually, like something had deeply disturbed you.
554. [shaky] My cat died that week and grief doesn't follow a, [breaking], convenient schedule for your investigation. [bitter laugh]
Character 1: [knowing] There's no record of you owning a cat, [direct], Mrs. Chen.
555. [whispered] Um, I mean, please just leave.
Character 1: [gentle] Listen, if someone threatened you or your family, we can, [reassuring], provide protection, but I need to know what you, [earnest], really saw through that window.
556. [panicking] You don't understand what kind of people were, [terrified], in that gallery, what they're capable of doing to someone who, [voice cracking], speaks up about their business dealings.
Character 1: The gallery owner's daughter is in the, [heavy], burn unit fighting for her life because she went back for her father's, [emotional], paintings, and anything you know could help us find who did this.
557. [struggling] She wasn't supposed to be there, nobody was supposed to, [anguished], be there that late.
Character 1: So, um, you did see who started it, I mean, you watched them go inside with, [intense], something, maybe accelerant or, [pushing], matches, and you've been carrying this, [dark], weight ever since, well, haven't you?
558. [defeated] Um, there were three of them, well, wearing those expensive suits like, [hollow], lawyers or politicians wear, and one had this, [haunted], distinctive scar across his left hand, you know, like a burn mark.
Character 1: [urgent] I need names, descriptions, anything that could, [determined], identify them. [resolute]
559. One of them looked directly at my, [frozen], window and pointed at me like he was, [chilling], marking me for later.
Character 1: [firm] Well, um, we're going to put you in protective custody tonight because what you just told me means, [grave], you're our key witness, I mean, to attempted murder.
560. [relieved] Thank God someone finally knows because the, [exhausted], weight of this secret has been destroying me.
Character 1: [protective] Pack a bag quickly because once we file this report, those men are, [serious], going to know you talked, and we need you, [focused], safe before that happens, [urgent], understood?
561. [resigned] You know, um, I kept thinking if I stayed quiet long enough, well, maybe they'd forget about the woman in the window, but, [accepting], monsters don't forget witnesses, and I mean, [trembling], they never forgive them either, [hollow], do they? [long pause]
Character 1: [trembling] Um, I haven't been near anything, [terrified], resembling a tank of water since, well, I nearly drowned at fourteen, so, uh, this is incredibly difficult.
562. [gentle] The hyperbaric chamber isn't filled with water at all—it's, [reassuring], pressurized oxygen that feels like sitting in an airplane, [calm], nothing more than that. [pause]
Character 1: [defeated] Um, well, I know.
563. [measured] Your surgeon said if we don't start treatment within, [serious], forty-eight hours, they'll need to schedule the amputation for, [heavy], next Tuesday morning.
Character 1: [desperate] I mean, I've been taking care of this, [frustrated], damn foot for three years with bandages and, um, antibiotics and now they're telling me I could, [voice breaking], lose it because I'm too, well, scared to get in that, [shaking], metal coffin.
564. [understanding] Listen, I've treated over two thousand patients in, [thoughtful], twenty years and every single one who was claustrophobic made it, [confident], through just fine.
Character 1: My wife keeps saying I'm being, [bitter], stubborn but she doesn't understand what drowning feels like.
565. [careful] Well, um, the thing is, I actually, [vulnerable], do understand because I almost drowned during, uh, dive training and that's why I, [earnest], specialized in helping people through their fears. [exhales]
Character 1: [surprised] You almost drowned but still work with, [incredulous], pressure chambers every single day?
566. Um, yeah, because facing it, [determined], every day took away its power over me and, well, now I help others, [passionate], do the same thing, I mean, reclaim their lives from fear.
Character 1: [skeptical] That sounds like something from a self-help book my daughter keeps, [dismissive], pushing on me about embracing discomfort or, [sarcastic], whatever nonsense they're selling these days.
567. Your daughter loves you enough to, [firm], research treatment options and drive you here at six in the morning.
Character 1: [softening] She's been sleeping in that uncomfortable chair outside for, [guilty], three nights straight. [sighs heavily]
568. [quiet] She's terrified too.
Character 1: [resolved] If I do this, I need you to, [anxious], promise me that you'll get me out immediately if I, [pleading], can't breathe properly.
569. [sincere] I have an intercom system, emergency release protocols, and I'll be, [reassuring], monitoring your vitals the entire time from right outside the, [gentle], window where you can see me constantly. [nods]
Character 1: [wavering] My grandkids have a soccer tournament next month and they're, [emotional], counting on me to be there cheering from the, [voice cracking], sidelines like always.
570. [encouraging] Then let's make sure you're there with, [warm], both feet firmly planted on that field.
Character 1: Well, I suppose if I survived, [resigned], Vietnam, two heart attacks, and, um, forty years of my wife's cooking, I can, [gathering courage], survive an hour in your, er, fancy oxygen tank.
571. [smiling] Um, that's the spirit—and hey, I mean, my chamber has, [playful], better reviews than most restaurants in town, so, well, you're in good hands. [chuckles]
Character 1: [concerned] I found your lab results in the, um, [quiet], system when I was reviewing the team's health records, and I mean, [careful], these numbers are telling me something you haven't, well, been willing to say out loud.
572. [defensive] Those were supposed to be, [tense], confidential medical records that nobody else had clearance to access.
Character 1: [gentle] As team physician I have oversight on everyone's, [measured], health data, especially when someone's white blood cell count is this, [worried], abnormal while they're working eighteen-hour days in the lab.
573. Well, um, the research can't stop just because my, [exhausted], immune system decided to, you know, wage war against itself, I mean.
Character 1: [soft] You're self-medicating with, umm, [shocked], immunosuppressants from the research supply while trying to finish this cancer treatment protocol, aren't you, I mean, [knowing], that's what these irregular procurement orders are really about, well.
574. [resigned] The irony isn't lost on me that I'm, [bitter], developing treatments for the exact condition that's slowly, [breaking], killing me from the inside out.
Character 1: How long have you, um, [pained], been hiding this from everyone while pushing yourself past, well, [frustrated], every reasonable limit your body keeps trying to set? [sighs heavily]
575. Since before I started the postdoc, um, [hollow], about three years now, and every day I calculate whether I have enough, well, [trembling], time left to finish what I started. [long pause]
Character 1: [whispered] Three years.
576. The treatment protocols I'm developing could, you know, [passionate], save thousands of people with autoimmune conditions, I mean, if I can just hold on long enough. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [firm] But you need proper medical care, not, um, [emphatic], stolen moments between experiments where you inject yourself in supply closets, and I mean, [desperate], you need someone who actually knows what they're doing to monitor your condition, well.
577. [vulnerable] Every specialist I've seen just wants to, [frustrated], put me on bed rest and conventional treatments that would mean abandoning everything I've, [pleading], worked toward for the past decade.
Character 1: What if we could, umm, [thoughtful], find a way to support your research while also, you know, [hopeful], getting you the treatment you desperately need? [softly]
578. [skeptical] You're suggesting what exactly, [curious], some kind of arrangement that lets me keep working?
Character 1: I'm suggesting that hiding this alone is, [warm], killing you faster than the disease itself, and maybe, [earnest], having someone who understands both your condition and your research could help.
579. [surprised] You studied autoimmune disorders before, um, [realizing], becoming a team physician, didn't you, that's why you recognized the, well, [amazed], patterns in my lab work that others would have missed, I mean.
Character 1: [quiet] Um, yeah. [pause]
580. [emotional] My mother had the same condition and died when, [shaking], I was fifteen. [tears forming]
Character 1: [compassionate] So this research isn't just academic for you, it's, [understanding], deeply personal and wrapped up in grief you've been carrying.
581. [tearful] Every breakthrough feels like I'm, umm, [intense], reaching back through time trying to save her, even though I know that's, well, [accepting], impossible, but maybe I can save someone else's mother, you know.
Character 1: [awkward] So um, I know this is, [struggling], weird for both of us but, well, your mom named me in her will as, [heavy], your guardian and I mean, I haven't seen you since the funeral. [sighs]
582. [hostile] Yeah well, you barely even, [bitter], knew her anymore so I don't know why she'd, um, pick someone who disappeared from our lives for, [cold], six years to suddenly be responsible for me.
Character 1: [defensive] Look, uh, I had my reasons for leaving town and, [regretful], your mom understood that even if, well, even if you don't right now.
583. [angry] Oh so you mean you two were, [sarcastic], secretly best friends while you were, um, gone living your perfect life and, well, never even called to check if we were, [trembling], still alive?
Character 1: Well, your mother and I stayed in touch through, [quietly], emails that you didn't know about because, um, she wanted to protect you from knowing how bad things really were.
584. [stunned] She never told me she was, [breaking], sick until it was too late. [voice cracks]
Character 1: [gentle] I know, sweetheart.
585. [bitter] Don't call me that.
Character 1: [firm] Listen, I'm not trying to, [careful], replace your mom or pretend I'm suddenly your, [uncomfortable], parent but the fact is she trusted me with this and I'm not going to, [resolute], let her down even if you hate me for it.
586. [challenging] Fine, then tell me why she, [demanding], picked you when she had actual family who could have, [accusatory], taken me in instead.
Character 1: Because your aunt is an alcoholic and your uncle, [harsh], lives in his car half the time.
587. [shocked] Wait, um, what do you mean Uncle Ray is, [confused], homeless because, well, Mom always said he had that job at the factory.
Character 1: [sympathetic] She protected you from a lot of, [sad], painful truths about your family.
588. So everyone's been lying to me about, [hurt], everything my whole life apparently.
Character 1: [steady] Not lying exactly, just trying to let you be a, [careful], kid for as long as possible before the world got too, [weary], complicated. [pauses]
589. [vulnerable] Well, um, I guess being sixteen with a dead mom is, [shaky], pretty complicated already so, I mean, there's no point protecting me anymore.
Character 1: You're right and that's why I'm going to be, [honest], completely straight with you from now on even when it's, [determined], hard because you deserve the truth about, [fierce], everything including why I left and why I came back.
590. [exhausted] Um, okay then.
Character 1: I mean, your mom saved my life once when we were teenagers and, [emotional], I promised her that if anything happened, well, I'd make sure you were, [breaking], okay even if it meant upending my entire existence. [voice trembles]
591. [soft] She saved your life and now you're supposed to, [uncertain], save mine or something?
Character 1: You don't recognize me with this, [hollow], face anymore but I sat across from you at breakfast for, [breaking], three years before I became someone else, [defeated], someone terrible.
592. [stunned] My God, it can't be—you're supposed to be, [trembling], dead, they told me you died in Prague five, [voice cracking], years ago.
Character 1: That was the first lie, um, I mean, the first of so many that, [exhausted], I can't even count them anymore, and well, [bitter], every single one ate away at who I used to be. [sighs heavily]
593. [firmly] You're standing in my courtroom as a defendant now, not as, [cold], the person I once loved.
Character 1: I know.
594. [struggling] This changes nothing about the charges—treason, [harsh], espionage, murder—but God help me, [breaking], I need to know why. [pause]
Character 1: They had our daughter, Sarah—they took her that morning you left for your conference and, [desperate], told me she'd die unless I, [shaking], turned. [voice breaks]
595. [whispered] Sarah's been safe. [long pause]
Character 1: [anguished] Um, what do you mean, safe?
596. [heavy] She's been with my mother this whole time, um, I mean, we faked her kidnapping to protect her from, [guilty], your handlers when we discovered what you were, but, [broken], we never knew you thought she was actually, well, actually taken. [exhales]
Character 1: [devastated] Five years of betraying everything I believed in, watching good people, [choking], die because of intelligence I passed, all for a, [hollow], lie.
597. You should have trusted me—I was investigating the mole in, [angry], the agency for months, watching you, [pained], suspecting you, and you never once, [bitter], came to me for help. [cries softly]
Character 1: [defeated] How could I risk telling you when they sent me photos of her, [trembling], bound and crying, when they played me recordings of her, [broken], voice begging for me to help her, [sobbing], even if they were all fake?
598. [quietly] Those photos were real—we staged them to flush out the mole, [regretful], never knowing the mole was you, that you'd see them and, [horrified], believe your worst nightmare had come true.
Character 1: [empty] So we destroyed each other without even knowing it—me betraying the country to save her, [bitter], you betraying us to catch me.
599. The jury won't care about any of this, um, I mean, they'll see a traitor who sold, [tired], classified information that got seventeen agents killed, and, well, [resigned], that's all that will matter now.
Character 1: I'm not asking for mercy, just, um, I needed you to know that underneath all the lies, [raw], I was still the person who loved you both more than, well, life itself. [breaks down]
600. Well, um, God help me, I still do too.
Character 1: [releasing] Then do what you have to do—send me away for, [accepting], life, but please, let me see her one last time so I can, [desperate], tell her that everything I did wrong was because I loved her, [pleading], too much. [sobs]
601. She's outside this courtroom right now, and, um, she's been waiting five years to, [emotional], hear her parent say those words, even if, well, [breaking], it's the last thing you ever tell her. [gavel strikes]
Character 1: [bitter] Um, you finally decided to show up after I, well, [shaky voice], after I had to watch them all die while waiting for, uh, [very quietly], the legendary knight who never came.
602. [apologetic] I know that, um, nothing I say can, [regretful], undo what happened but I was, er, trapped in the eastern passages for three days, you know.
Character 1: [angry] Well, I held that bridge alone for, um, [crying while speaking], six hours while the villagers escaped, and every minute I kept, like, [exhausted], thinking you'd come charging over that hill with your, uh, perfect armor gleaming. [sigh]
603. [empathetically] The weight of their deaths isn't yours alone to carry, [very sad], even though I know that's exactly what you're doing right now.
Character 1: [frustrated] Um, don't you dare try to, well, [loudly], absolve me when you weren't even there to see what I, er, [whispering], had to become to survive it. [long pause]
604. [hesitantly] Um, I, well, I understand.
Character 1: [somber] My sword arm still won't stop shaking from, [trembling], the things I had to do out there. [gasp softly]
605. [warm] Listen, um, I've seen that look before in, [slowly], warriors who've survived when, well, others didn't. [pause]
Character 1: Um, the children kept asking where the knight was, and I, like, [upset], had to keep lying that you were coming while I, er, [breaking], knew deep down that we were alone and I'd have to, well, [very melancholic], make impossible choices.
606. [stern] Stop.
Character 1: You want me to stop because the truth makes you, [anxious], uncomfortable or because you can't handle knowing what your, [furious], absence cost those people and what it, [hoarse], turned me into? [groan]
607. [mollifying] Well, I'm not asking you to forgive me because, um, [guilty], I haven't forgiven myself either, but we need to, er, [desperately], find a way forward from this. [sniffle]
Character 1: There is no forward when part of you dies, [hollow], defending people who deserved better than one broken person against impossible odds.
608. [very sincerely] Um, I swear on my oath that I'll spend, well, [passionately], whatever time I have left making sure you never stand alone again, even if you, like, [determined], hate me for failing you when it mattered most. [cough]
Character 1: [monotone] Your oaths mean nothing to me now after I learned what, [coldly], real sacrifice looks like without the comfort of, [disgusted], shining armor and noble vows. [laugh]
609. [confused] Well, um, then why did you, [curious], send for me to meet you here if not to, er, find some kind of resolution?
Character 1: [resigned] Because I needed to look you in the eye and, [quietly], see if you truly understood the weight of what happened, or if you'd just, [dismissive], offer empty platitudes like every other hero who arrives, [sarcastic], too late to actually help. [short pause]
610. [earnest] Um, I see it now in your eyes—the same, well, [haunted], darkness I saw in my mentor after he survived the massacre at, uh, [trailing off], Thornwall.
Character 1: [weary] Well, maybe that's enough then, knowing that, um, [relieved], someone else understands what it costs to be the only one left standing.
611. [gentle] Um, the survivors you saved are holding a ceremony tomorrow to, er, [hopeful], honor your courage, and they asked me to make sure you'd, well, [kindly], be there because you're their hero now, not me. [deep breath]
Character 1: [exhausted] You keep saying this place is for my, [bitter], protection but these glass walls and cameras make it feel more like, [anxious], an exhibit than a safehouse. [sigh]
612. [uncertain] Look, um, I know this isn't ideal but, well, [hesitantly], the startup teams working here provide perfect cover because, er, [quietly], no one suspects a tech incubator would harbor a corporate whistleblower.
Character 1: [frustrated] Three weeks of pretending to be interested in pitch decks while my, [shaky voice], former employer is probably planning my elimination.
613. The FBI insisted, um, we maintain appearances until the trial date which means, [firmly], you need to keep attending those entrepreneur workshops even though, well, [regretful], I understand how absurd this all feels. [pause]
Character 1: [bored] Yesterday someone asked me about my startup idea and I almost, [sarcastic], told them it was exposing billion-dollar fraud schemes.
614. [warm] Actually, um, your insights during those sessions have been, er, surprisingly valuable because you understand corporate structures better than, well, most of these kids with their apps.
Character 1: [confused] Are you seriously trying to recruit me into your, [incredulous], startup ecosystem while I'm hiding for my life?
615. No, I mean, what I'm saying is that, [empathetically], you've already shown incredible courage and, um, [truthful], that's exactly the kind of person who could build something meaningful. [chuckle]
Character 1: Building something meaningful is what got me into this, [angry], mess when I discovered those cooked books.
616. [gently] Well, um, the prosecutor called this morning and, er, [nervous], they're moving the trial up by two weeks which means, you know, [slowly], this arrangement ends sooner than we thought. [groan]
Character 1: [relieved] Thank god because watching these twentysomethings pitch their, [mocking], revolutionary apps while I'm processing trauma is, [very quietly], destroying what's left of my sanity. [laugh]
617. [sincere] Listen, um, I've hosted hundreds of entrepreneurs here but, well, [passionate], none of them risked everything for truth like you did.
Character 1: [melancholic] The truth cost me my career and my safety and my, [trembling], entire identity while the executives who orchestrated it all are still, [loudly], playing golf at their country clubs. [cry]
618. [determined] Which is exactly why, um, your testimony matters because, er, [confident], without people like you these systems never change.
Character 1: You know, um, sometimes I wonder if, well, [sad], I should have just kept quiet and taken the money like everyone else, I mean, [whispering], at least I'd still have a life.
619. [proud] But you wouldn't have been able to live with yourself and that's, [admiring], what makes you extraordinary. [gasp softly]
Character 1: [tired] Extraordinary feels a lot like exhaustion when you're sleeping in a, [desperate], glass fishbowl surrounded by whiteboards covered in startup jargon. [cough]
620. [sympathetic] After you testify there's a position here if you want it because we need someone who understands, [hopeful], both innovation and integrity to mentor these founders before they lose, [worried], their moral compass to venture capital. [long pause]
Character 1: [surprised] Wait, you're offering me a real job after all this, um, [touched], not just another safe house pretense but an actual chance to, well, [emotional], rebuild something from these ashes? [sniffle]
621. [smiling speaking] Well, um, absolutely, I mean, yes.
Character 1: So, um, I keep trying to reconcile the person who, [hesitantly], used to rescue injured birds with me as kids with someone who now, [confused], runs a place like this, you know, I mean.
622. [diplomatic] The world isn't as simple as when we were twelve and, [patiently], thought we could save every creature we found, though I understand why, [warm], you might see this as betrayal.
Character 1: [quietly] Well, um, maybe it is.
623. [defensive] You know, er, I employ forty people who, [frustrated], need these jobs to feed their families, and um, that matters too, I mean. [sigh]
Character 1: [bitter] Right, um, of course.
624. [opening-up] Look, uh, every morning when I walk through those doors, [conflicted], I remember that summer we nursed that hawk back to health, and well, [shaky voice], it tears at something inside me that I can't, er, explain to anyone else. [pause]
Character 1: [surprised] You still think about that hawk we named Phoenix, [cherishing], after all these years of doing what you do here, [empathetically], even though it must hurt? [gasp softly]
625. Phoenix taught me that sometimes, [regretful], mercy comes in forms we don't expect or want to acknowledge, and, [very quietly], maybe that's what I tell myself to sleep at night.
Character 1: [apologetic] Maybe I came here expecting, [angry], to find a monster instead of my oldest friend still fighting their own conscience.
626. [relieved] God, you know, I mean, nobody else would understand why I keep that photo of us with Phoenix, [emotionally], in my desk drawer here of all places, um. [crying while speaking]
Character 1: Well, I mean, maybe that photo is your reminder that, [tenderly], you were someone else once, er, before life got complicated, you know. [chuckle]
627. [exhausted] Um, some days I sit at this desk and wonder if that kid would, [disappointed], recognize who I've become, or if they'd, [whispered], understand the compromises I've made to survive in this world, I mean. [long pause]
Character 1: That kid would probably be confused by both of us, [sad], by how we've learned to live with contradictions that once seemed, [passionate], impossible to accept. [groan]
628. [formal] Well, you know, I have to make a choice every day between, [determined], being the person I thought I'd become and, [steadily], being the person my family needs me to be, um. [cough]
Character 1: I mean, er, I guess we all make those choices, [melancholic], just in different ways that sometimes, [authentic], put us on opposite sides of things we once believed together, you know.
629. [sincere] But you still came here to see me, [grateful], despite everything this place represents to you, and, [hopeful], that has to mean our friendship survived somehow. [laugh]
Character 1: Of course it survived because real connection, [fierce], transcends the roles we play, even when those roles, [very sincerely], seem irreconcilable. [sniffle]
630. [softly] Thank you for that.
Character 1: [thoughtful] You know, um, maybe the real tragedy isn't what we've become but, [gently], how we've learned to forgive ourselves for it, and well, [peacefully], forgive each other too, I mean.
631. [trembling] After all these years of feeling alone with this weight, [relieved], hearing you say that makes me believe that maybe, [tearfully], the kid with the injured hawk is still in here somewhere, [voice breaking], waiting to be remembered.
Character 1: [stern] Never thought I'd see you three hundred feet up in the air working on, [bitter], anything mechanical after you said my trade was dying.
632. [defensive] Dad, please.
Character 1: [frustrated] This bearing assembly is the same principle I taught you when you were, [shaky voice], twelve in the shop but you wouldn't listen because traditional machining wasn't, [condescending], green enough for you. [sigh]
633. [anxious] Well, um, I mean, the thing is these turbines require, [hesitantly], specialized training that goes beyond just, er, basic mechanical work, you know?
Character 1: [loudly] Um, specialized training doesn't mean much when the, [angry], gearbox is seized and you've been up here for, umm, three hours without fixing it, does it? [groan]
634. [very quietly] The diagnostic software says it's an electrical fault but the, [confused], symptoms don't match anything in our manual. [pause]
Character 1: [mocking] Software can't feel metal fatigue or hear when a, [passionate], bearing is crying for help the way someone who's spent forty years, [slowly], listening to machines can.
635. [embarrassed] You're saying this whole shutdown is just a, [whispering], mechanical failure that our million-dollar monitoring system, [desperate], completely missed because we rely too much on computers?
Character 1: [confidently] Hand me that wrench and I'll show you how the vibration pattern tells us it's, [warm], not electrical at all but a simple misalignment that's been, [quickly], cascading through the drivetrain for weeks.
636. [curious] Well, er, how could you possibly know that without, umm, even running a diagnostic check first?
Character 1: [gently] Because your fancy turbine is still just gears and bearings and shafts, [proud], the same fundamentals I've been machining since before you were born, and metal, [very sincerely], always tells the truth if you know how to listen. [chuckle]
637. [amazed] The pitch of that whine changes exactly where you said the, [relieved], misalignment would be worst.
Character 1: You know, um, maybe if we worked together instead of, [regretful], fighting about old versus new technology, we could, well, actually solve this faster. [cough]
638. [appreciative] Um, yeah, I mean, okay.
Character 1: [excited] See that scoring pattern on the shaft tells us the whole story of what happened, [animated], just like reading a book written in metal, [cheerful], if you know the language. [laugh]
639. I spent so many years thinking your work was, [ashamed], obsolete but watching you diagnose this in minutes when our team couldn't fix it in, [admiring], hours makes me realize how much I still need to, er, learn from you.
Character 1: [soft-spoken] Not obsolete, son.
640. [emotional] The way you touch that metal and immediately know what's wrong is something no, [respectful], computer program could ever replace and I was too, [trembling], stubborn to see it before today.
Character 1: [warm] These renewable energy machines you work on are the future and I'm, [very proud], proud you're part of that even if I don't understand all the electronics.
641. [hopeful] Maybe you could teach me the old-school diagnostics while I show you the, [enthusiastic], turbine control systems because we make a pretty good team when we're not, [joking], arguing about everything. [laugh loudly]
Character 1: Uncle Mike, um, I need to, [formal], ask you some questions about your, [hesitantly], involvement with the Constitutional Patriots group, and, well, I mean, this isn't, [rigid], how I wanted us to meet again.
642. [defensive] So, uh, after three years of not visiting, you show up, [bitter], at my door with a badge and, umm, [frustrated], accusations about people who actually care about this country. [sigh]
Character 1: [stern] Look, I mean, we have evidence linking your group to, [quietly], weapons stockpiling and, um, threats against federal buildings, so this isn't just, well, some fishing expedition.
643. [passionately] Those aren't threats, they're discussions about our, [advocating], constitutional rights to defend ourselves against government, [loudly], overreach which you'd understand if you weren't so blinded by your federal paycheck. [groan]
Character 1: [conflicted] Um, you taught me to respect the law when I was, [shaky voice], growing up, so how did we, well, end up on opposite sides of this?
644. [warm] The law I taught you to respect was about, [empathetically], protecting people, not about enforcing unconstitutional mandates that, [slowly], strip away our freedoms one regulation at a time.
Character 1: I mean, you're asking me to, [torn], choose between my duty and my family here.
645. [cold] Well, seems like you already made that choice when you, uh, walked up here wearing that badge. [pause]
Character 1: [anxious] Uncle Mike, I mean, if you just cooperate and, [whispering], distance yourself from the more extreme members, we could, um, [pleading], work something out before this escalates beyond my control.
646. [angry] There are no extreme members, just patriots who, [proudly], refuse to bow down to tyranny dressed up as security.
Character 1: The people you're defending are planning to, [urgently], blow up a federal courthouse next month according to our, [very quietly], intercepted communications. [cough]
647. [shocked] That's not true, we've never discussed any, [trembling], violent action against buildings or, [confused], civilians in any of our meetings whatsoever.
Character 1: [regretful] Well, um, maybe you haven't been included in, [carefully], all the conversations, especially the ones that, uh, happen after you leave.
648. [betrayed] So, um, you're saying my own people have been, [hurt], planning attacks behind my back while I, well, advocated for peaceful resistance?
Character 1: [relieved] Um, finally. [trailing off]
649. [desperate] I mean, I built this group on principles of, [breaking], constitutional defense, not terrorism, and, um, now you're telling me they've been using my name for this? [cry]
Character 1: [gentle] Well, um, that's why I'm here.
650. [defeated] If what you're saying is true, then everything I've been, [exhausted], fighting for has been corrupted into exactly what I stood, [whispering loudly], against all these years. [sniffle]
Character 1: [hopeful] Help me stop them before innocent people get, [firmly], hurt, and I'll make sure the Bureau knows you were never, [sincerely], part of the violent planning.
651. [resolved] Give me twenty-four hours to gather the real patriots who believe in, [determined], peaceful resistance, and we'll help you identify the ones who've been, [disgusted], planning these attacks.
Character 1: [confused] That clipboard you're holding with all those, [slowly], soil samples and environmental tests looks official but you're standing on, [bitter], my land without permission.
652. [hesitantly] Um, well, I'm, uh, here legally.
Character 1: [stern] The way you're standing there with your head tilted just, [pause], like your mother used to when she was thinking hard about, [shaky voice], something makes me wonder if I'm seeing ghosts from, [trailing off], decades past.
653. [quietly] Grandpa, it's, um, me.
Character 1: [shocked] Rebecca, after fifteen years of nothing, not even, [whispering], a single phone call or letter, you show up here in, [angry], professional clothes pretending to be some kind of, [speeding up], government inspector on my property?
654. I'm not pretending anything, I'm actually an environmental scientist now studying, [frustrated], agricultural runoff patterns in this watershed. [sigh]
Character 1: [warm] Well, um, you always did love playing in the creek behind the barn, catching, [pleased], tadpoles and asking me endless questions about, like, why the water changed colors after it rained.
655. [regretful] Those summers here shaped everything I became, taught me to, [passionate], care about the land in ways that eventually put me at, [nervous], odds with how you farm it.
Character 1: So, uh, that's why you left then, because you thought I was, well, [disappointed], destroying the very earth that's fed our family for four generations by, [exhausted], using methods my own father taught me? [cough]
656. [anxious] No, I mean, it wasn't just that, um, it was the way you and dad couldn't, [crying while speaking], hear anything I said about sustainable practices without calling me an ungrateful, like, [very quietly], idealistic child who didn't understand real farming. [sniffle]
Character 1: [empathetically] Your father never recovered from you leaving, spent his last years, [melancholic], staring at your empty chair at Sunday dinners while I tried to, [whispering loudly], pretend everything was fine when nothing was.
657. [apologetic] I know, um, I should have come to the funeral but, well, facing everyone after so many years of, [trembling], silence felt impossible especially when I knew they'd all, [monotone], blame me for breaking his heart, you know?
Character 1: [gently] Well, umm, the truth is we both said things we couldn't take back, like, [sad], when I told you that book learning would never matter more than, [relieved], generations of practical wisdom passed down through working hands. [gasp softly]
658. The thing is, um, grandpa, I've spent fifteen years proving that, well, [determined], science and tradition don't have to be enemies if we just, [hopeful], listen to each other.
Character 1: You know, I've actually been reading about, um, some of those conservation methods you used to, [curious], talk about at dinner before everything went wrong, and well, [proud], I even implemented a few on the north forty acres.
659. [surprised] Really, you actually tried the buffer strips and cover crops I suggested all those, [excited], years ago when I was just a know-it-all college kid? [laugh]
Character 1: [chuckling] The ironies of old age include discovering your granddaughter might have, [sincerely], been right about things you were too stubborn to hear while also knowing it's, [very sad], probably too late to properly make amends for all those wasted years. [deep sigh]
660. Maybe it's not too late if we start with, um, [carefully], just walking the land together like we used to, you know?
Character 1: [tearful] Well, um, I suppose so.
661. [hopefully] We could start at the old creek where you first taught me to, [nostalgic], read the health of the water by the insects living in it, before, [genuine], everything got so complicated between us.
Character 1: [frustrated] You overrode my judgment in there when I've been, [angry], managing that patient's care for twelve hours and you, [loudly], just walked in and changed everything.
662. [defensive] The baby was showing clear signs of, [stern], distress on the monitors that you were, [hesitantly], apparently missing while you focused on, [bitter], your holistic approach.
Character 1: [heated] Um, I wasn't missing anything, I mean, I was giving her body time to, [shaky voice], progress naturally like we discussed in the birth plan. [sigh]
663. [apologetic] Look, um, maybe I came on too strong but, [regretful], thirty years of experience told me we needed to act. [pause]
Character 1: She trusted me to advocate for her wishes and you made me look, [upset], incompetent in front of a woman who was already, [anxious], terrified of medical intervention. [groan]
664. [quietly] Well, I'm sorry.
Character 1: [exhausted] The thing is, we both wanted the same outcome but your approach completely, [sad], undermined the rapport I'd built with her over, [whispering], months of prenatal visits. [long pause]
665. [warm] I know, um, you're right about that and I should have, well, [empathetically], communicated with you before making that call instead of just, [slowly], barging in. [cough]
Character 1: [very quietly] Thank you.
666. [sincerely] You're an excellent midwife and I've seen you, [relieved], handle incredibly difficult situations with grace that most doctors, [confidently], including myself, couldn't match.
Character 1: [surprised] I wasn't expecting you to say that after how, [emotional], heated things got between us in there.
667. Well, um, the truth is, I mean, we both let our egos get in the way of, [thoughtful], collaborating properly today.
Character 1: The mother and baby are both healthy now which is what, [calm], matters most, even if the process was more, [tired], medicalized than she wanted.
668. [gentle] You know, um, maybe we should develop a better system for, [hopeful], communicating during these critical moments.
Character 1: [eager] I've actually been thinking about proposing a protocol where we have, [animated], brief huddles before any major interventions.
669. [interested] That's, well, that's actually brilliant and I mean, it would prevent situations like today from, [enthusiastic], happening again. [chuckle]
Character 1: [pleased] Maybe we could present it together at the next staff meeting to show we're, [proud], united on this approach.
670. After twenty years of these power struggles between midwives and, [reflective], attendings on this floor, maybe we can finally model what, [optimistic], real collaboration looks like.
Character 1: [tender] You know, despite our disagreement today, I've learned more from watching you work than, [grateful], anyone else here, and I respect your expertise even when we, [honest], clash about methodology. [sniffle]
671. [moved] That means, um, more than you know, and well, I should tell you that your patient-centered approach has actually, [sincere], changed how I practice medicine over the years. [short pause]
Character 1: [anxious] These tapestries have been hanging here since, [confused], 1897 and now they're suddenly, [frustrated], deteriorating faster than ever before, [very quietly], according to our maintenance reports.
672. [warm] Well, I mean, I haven't been back to this theater in, um, [nostalgic], thirty years but these fabrics were already, [shaky voice], showing stress when I worked here as, like, an apprentice. [sigh]
Character 1: You know, um, the board is, [terrified], breathing down my neck about this because, well, these tapestries are worth more than the entire venue itself, I mean. [pause]
673. [optimistic] Actually, um, the damage patterns suggest, [excited], environmental changes rather than age, so, you know, we might be able to, [relieved], reverse most of the deterioration with proper treatment.
Character 1: [surprised] The previous manager never mentioned any, [hopeful], conservation issues in his notes, which seems, [bitter], criminally negligent considering what we're dealing with here.
674. [empathetically] Um, well, most people don't understand that, like, [passionately], textiles are living documents that need constant care, not just, er, decorative wallpaper to impress donors, you know?
Character 1: [regretful] We've been running the air conditioning at maximum to keep, [worried], audiences comfortable during summer performances without considering what that, [quietly], might do to century-old silk threads.
675. The humidity fluctuations alone are, um, [angry], causing micro-tears that will eventually become, well, [exhausted], catastrophic failures if we don't intervene immediately, I mean.
Character 1: [desperate] Tell me there's something we can do because, [pleading], losing these tapestries would destroy this venue's historical significance and, [trembling], probably end my career in heritage management. [gasp]
676. There's a new conservation technique using, [confident], vapor-phase consolidation that could stabilize the fibers without removing them from display. [laugh]
Character 1: [curious] My grandfather was actually the venue manager here in the 1960s and he, [melancholic], wrote journals about watching these tapestries catch the morning light through, [whispering], those original stained glass windows before they installed the spotlights. [long pause]
677. Those old journals might actually contain, um, [eager], crucial information about the original hanging methods and, well, [thoughtful], environmental conditions that kept them stable for so long, you know?
Character 1: [determined] Look, um, I need you to understand that this venue means, [emotionally], everything to this community and, well, we can't let it lose its soul, you know? [cry]
678. [gently] The tapestries remember every performance, every, [wistful], ovation, every quiet moment between acts when the theater breathed with, [reverent], its own ancient life.
Character 1: [urgently] So, I mean, how much time do we realistically have before, um, [nervous], the damage becomes irreversible and we lose them forever, like?
679. [serious] With immediate intervention, we can stabilize them within, [measured], six weeks, but every day we wait costs us months of, [firm], potential preservation time.
Character 1: [defeated] I can't.
680. You can because these tapestries have survived wars, floods, and, [inspiring], generations of neglect waiting for someone who actually cares enough to save them.
Character 1: [resolute] Well, um, then we start tomorrow at dawn when the light is, [energized], perfect for documenting every thread, and, I mean, [passionate], we won't stop until these tapestries can survive another century, you know?
681. [joyful] That's the spirit I remember from thirty years ago when this place still, [satisfied], believed in miracles and preservation was an act of love. [chuckle]
Character 1: [hesitantly] Um, I need to be honest with you about, [delicate], something that's concerning me regarding your application, because, uh, the inconsistencies in your documentation are, [dissatisfied], making this review more complicated than it should be, you know, and I mean, we need to address these issues.
682. I understand your position completely and, [anxious], I realize how this must look from your perspective, but these inconsistencies exist because, [shaky voice], my government destroyed most of my original documents after I exhibited my last installation, and, [frustrated], getting replacements would mean exposing myself to them again.
Character 1: [formal] The problem is that without proper verification, [stern], our protocols don't allow me much flexibility here. [pause]
683. [defensive] So you're telling me that bureaucratic protocols, [bitter], matter more than the fact that returning home means, [crying while speaking], facing imprisonment or worse for simply creating art that questions authority, and, [very quietly], you can sit there knowing this?
Character 1: Look, um, it's not that I don't understand your situation or, [empathetically], sympathize with what you're facing, but er, I have responsibilities and, [regretful], regulations that I'm bound to follow here, you know?
684. [warm] I mean, I get that you're just doing your job, and um, I shouldn't take my frustration out on, [apologetic], someone who's actually listening to me, but like, this whole system feels designed to, [exhausted], fail people when they need help most, you know? [sigh]
Character 1: [quietly] Um, between you and me, I've been learning about, [curious], cases like yours where artists face persecution, and, well, there might be alternative documentation we could explore if, [whispering], you're willing to work with me on this, I mean, unofficially speaking.
685. [relieved] You would actually do that for me, even though, [surprised], we just met and you have no obligation to help beyond, [grateful], the standard procedure? [long pause]
Character 1: I became a consular officer to, [passionate], help people navigate these impossible situations, not to, [upset], become another obstacle in their path to safety.
686. [thoughtful] Sometimes I forget there are still people who, [sincerely], see beyond the paperwork to the human being sitting across from them. [chuckle]
Character 1: [confidently] Well, um, I need you to understand that this process won't be easy and, [serious], we'll need to document everything meticulously, but, uh, if you're willing to be completely transparent with me, I mean, we might find a way forward.
687. [eager] Um, I'll share everything, like, every exhibition, every police report, every threat I received, er, even though reliving it, [trembling], terrifies me beyond words, you know?
Character 1: [gently] We can take breaks whenever you need them because this isn't just about, [protective], filling out forms anymore.
688. [determined] Well, um, where do we start with this, [nervous], alternative path you mentioned, I mean?
Character 1: [professional] First, I need you to write a detailed statement about, [focused], your artistic work and its political implications, then we'll build our case from, [motivated], there using humanitarian grounds rather than standard visa categories.
689. [overwhelmed] I mean, you're literally offering me a chance at, [emotional], survival when I thought all doors were closing, and um, I don't know how to properly express, [tearful], what this means to me, like, you're saving my life here, you know?
Character 1: [softly] Well, uh, let's not celebrate yet because we still have, [cautious], a long road ahead, but um, I promise I'll do everything within my power to, [committed], help you find safety, you know?
690. [hopeful] Um, okay then, like, let's begin.
Character 1: [reassuring] Take your time gathering your thoughts because we're going to, [patient], do this right. [deep breath]
691. [resolved] For the first time in months, I actually believe there might be, [optimistic], a future worth fighting for. [smile]
Character 1: [quietly] This diary has seen better days, the binding is, [concerned], completely shot and the pages are so fragile they're, [carefully], practically disintegrating, but with proper treatment I can, [hopeful], stabilize it for you. [pause]
692. [depressed] My mother wrote in this thing every single night for thirty years until the, [bitter], cancer took her voice away.
Character 1: [perceptive] The water damage here suggests it was stored somewhere with high humidity, probably a basement or, [trailing off], attic maybe...
693. Um, yeah, well, I mean, after she died I just threw it in a box with everything else I couldn't, [shaky voice], deal with.
Character 1: [gently] These ink smudges aren't from water though, they're from tears, [observant], recent ones by the look of the salt patterns, and the pages here are, [hesitantly], worn from being read over and over.
694. I, umm, started reading it last month, you know, and discovered she wrote about how disappointed she was in, [exhausted], me. [sigh]
Character 1: [warm] Parents write their fears in diaries, not their truths, and I've restored enough journals to know that, [empathetically], disappointment is usually just love wrapped in, [sad], worry about things they couldn't control. [long pause]
695. [whispering] Sometimes I wonder.
Character 1: The entries you've bookmarked with these torn pieces of newspaper are all from, [curious], 1994 through 1996, which based on your age would have been your, [thoughtful], teenage years when everything feels like the end of the, [melancholic], world. [laugh]
696. [defensive] Those were the years I dropped out of college, got arrested twice, and basically confirmed every, [frustrated], terrible thing she thought about my generation being slackers with no, [angry], ambition or direction in life.
Character 1: [stern] Well, um, I mean, you're here now paying good money to preserve her words, so maybe, [kindly], that says something about who you became.
697. You know, umm, the irony is that, well, she died before I could tell her I finally got my life together, er, started my own business and, [regretful], everything she wanted for me.
Character 1: [passionate] Look at this entry from 1999 where she pressed this flower between the pages, writing about how proud she was when you, [excited], called her that Christmas, how she knew you'd find your way because you always, [very sincerely], had her stubborn streak. [gasp softly]
698. Umm, I never, well, I didn't get that far in reading yet because, [trembling], the earlier stuff hurt too much.
Character 1: Most people want me to restore books to their, [nostalgic], original state, but sometimes the damage tells a story that's worth, [contemplative], preserving too.
699. [crying while speaking] So, um, like, you know, maybe we could keep some of those tear stains and, well, the worn pages as they are, I mean, evidence that someone, [hopefully], cared enough to read them. [cough]
Character 1: [relieved] That's exactly right.
700. She wrote in the margins sometimes about, [animatedly], wanting to talk to me but not knowing how to bridge the gap between her Depression-era childhood and my, [bittersweet], MTV generation cynicism.
Character 1: [confidently] Well, um, I can preserve both the original text and her margin notes, er, create a conservation treatment that, [professionally], honors the complete narrative, you know, including the parts where you both struggled to, [softly], understand each other. [deep pitch]
701. Maybe that's, um, what I really need, well, not just her story but, [tearfully], our story preserved together somehow. [sniffle]
702. [exhausted] They said I was free. Just like that, you know? Ten years and then suddenly—[bitter] "congratulations, you're innocent." [pause] Like, um, what am I supposed to do with that now? 

[confused] I went to the house today. Well, I mean, it's not our house anymore, is it? [very quietly] There's a minivan in the driveway. Not even the same color paint on the door. [sniffle] And honestly, when I called Sarah, she was so... [hesitantly] polite. Like I was some distant cousin or, I don't know, a telemarketer maybe. [sarcastic] "Oh, hi David. Yeah, we heard. That's really great news." 

[angry] Great news? Really? That's—[trailing off] that's what we're calling this? [pause] The kids don't even, um, they don't remember me. Jake called me "sir" on the phone. [very sad] My own son called me sir. 

[shaky voice] Mom said they had to move on, you know? Had to "protect the children" from all of it. [frustrated] Like I was the criminal! Even though I was—[loudly] I was innocent the whole time! [long pause]

[very slowly] So here I am, right? Free man. [regretful] Exonerated. [whispering] Completely alone.
703. [gasp softly] Hello? Oh honey, I—wait, what? [pause] You... you understand? About the, um, about all those times I had to say no? [shaky voice] I'm sitting down, I just—hold on. [sniffle] You know, sweetie, there were so many nights I'd, like, lie awake wondering if I was doing the right thing. When you'd storm off to your room after I said you couldn't—[crying while speaking] God, I'm sorry, I'm getting all emotional here. It's just that, well, hearing you say this now... [relieved] I always hoped that maybe someday you'd, you know, see that it wasn't about being mean or, I mean, controlling. [warm] Every "no" to those parties, every curfew, the college you wanted versus what we could afford—[regretful] I know it seemed like I was just, basically, ruining your life. But honestly, [very sincerely] all I could see were the dangers you couldn't. And now you're telling me that—[pause] that you get it? [happy] Oh sweetheart. You have no idea how much I needed to hear this. Really. [sniffle] Your dad always said you'd understand when you had your own kids, but I just... [trailing off] Thank you for calling, baby. Thank you.
704. [warm] You know what's funny? I keep thinking about, um, how Sarah just—she never actually told me to do it. [pause] That's the thing that gets me, I guess. Like, she was just there at the climbing wall, and honestly, everyone else was being so, [animated] "You can do it! Come on!" [trailing off] But Sarah... [smiling speaking] She just nodded at me, you know? This tiny little nod. And then she, er, started climbing herself, [slowly] not even looking back to see if I'd follow. [short pause] 

I mean, the way she moved was just—[admiringly] there was no hesitation, right? No big show. [quietly] Just this quiet certainty that, well, of course she could do this. [laugh] And I'm standing there literally shaking, thinking about how high it was, and, [anxious] oh God, what if I freeze halfway up? [pause] But then I watched her reach for each hold like it was, hmm, the most natural thing. [confidently] Not showing off, just... being.

[empathetically] And something about that made me think, [slowly] okay, maybe I don't have to be loud about being brave. [relieved] So I just, um, grabbed the first hold. [very sincerely] And Sarah? She glanced down once and, [chuckle] I swear, she almost smiled.
705. [extremely happy] I knew it! I fucking knew it! Three years ago when I saw those canvases in that dingy studio, everyone thought I was—well, [laugh loudly] they thought I was completely insane. But honestly, there was just something about the way she used light, you know? [warm] Like she was painting with actual sunlight somehow. 

[pause] And tonight, I mean—the Guggenheim people were there. [very excited] The actual Guggenheim! Her piece, um, the one with the fractured mirrors? [passionately] Someone offered two hundred thousand on the spot. Two hundred! For an artist who was literally painting in her grandmother's garage six months ago. 

[relieved] God, I was so nervous she wouldn't show up. She almost didn't, actually—[chuckle] had to basically drag her out of the bathroom where she was having a panic attack. But then, [proudly speaking] watching her talk to those collectors, seeing them finally get what I've been seeing all along... 

[shaky voice] My hands are still trembling. Like, this is why I do this job, right? [very sincerely] Not for the commission, though obviously that's nice, but for this exact moment when someone who deserves it, [emotional] someone who's been grinding and creating in obscurity finally, finally gets their shot. [sigh] We did it. We actually fucking did it.
706. [extremely happy] Three restaurants! I mean, can you even—Maria just opened her third location! [laugh] God, I remember when she first walked into my office, right? She had this, um, beat-up notebook with all these recipes and, like, honestly barely enough for the deposit on one stove. [warm] And now she's got three full restaurants. Three!

I just—[chuckle]—okay so yesterday she sends me this photo of the grand opening, and there's literally, you know, a line around the block. [excited] A line around the block! For her food! The same woman who, uh, two years ago was basically crying in my office because she thought, I mean, she thought we'd reject her application.

[sigh] You know what really gets me though? It's not just—it's not even about the loan being paid back early, which, hey, that's great for our numbers. [passionately] But it's like, her daughter is now managing the second location! Her nephew works as, um, as a sous chef! She's employed, what, forty people now? [very quietly] Forty families eating because Maria believed she could do this and we—[trailing off] we just gave her that tiny push, you know?

[laugh loudly] Sometimes this job is absolutely worth it.
707. [confused] The school called and I—I don't even know how to process this. Like, selling your Adderall? To other kids? [pause] For months? How did I not... [shaky voice] oh my God, how did I not notice the pills were missing? I mean, I trusted you with managing your own medication because you're sixteen and I thought—[angry] Jesus Christ, what were you thinking? 

Actually, no, wait—[very quietly] were you even taking them yourself? Have you been, um, struggling with your ADHD this whole time while I just... [sigh] This is my fault somehow, right? Like, I should've been counting pills or, I don't know, checking or something. [frustrated] But selling them? That's—that's illegal! You could've—[pause] the other kids could've gotten hurt. 

[crying while speaking] I keep thinking about, you know, all those times you asked for extra money for "school stuff" and I just... [bitter] God, I'm such an idiot. Were you in trouble? Did someone pressure you or—[hesitantly] or was this just about making money? Because if you needed something, we could've figured it out together. [very sad] I thought we talked about everything. When did we stop... [trailing off] when did you stop trusting me enough to just talk to me?
708. [shaky voice] Hey, it's me. Um, I know it's late but I just—I needed to call you. [clearing throat] So, I've been thinking about, you know, everything that happened these past few months and... [pause] God, I don't even know how to say this right. [emotional] The thing is, when I was in that place—that really dark place where I couldn't see any way forward—you were there. Every single day, man. [crying while speaking] Even when I pushed everyone away, even when I was being impossible, you just... you stayed. 

[deep breath] I mean, honestly, there were nights I didn't think I'd make it to morning. Like, literally couldn't imagine existing another day. [very quietly] But then you'd text me some stupid meme at 2 AM, or you'd just show up with takeout, not even saying anything about how messed up I looked. [laugh] Remember that time you dragged me to that terrible action movie? I complained the whole time but, [warm] it was exactly what I needed, you know?

[passionately] I'm alive because of you. That's not—that's not an exaggeration. [sniffle] You saved my life by just... being you. By not giving up on me when I'd given up on myself. [very sincerely] Thank you doesn't even begin to cover it, but... thank you, brother. For everything.
709. God, I mean, where do I even start with this place? [overwhelmed] Walking through that front door was like—it's basically a maze of newspapers from 1973. [nervous laugh] And honestly, the smell is... yeah. So Grandma left me the house, which is, you know, incredibly generous, but [hesitantly] I opened the living room door and there's literally a wall of TV Guides reaching the ceiling. [gasp softly] Like, who needs that many TV Guides? 

[very sad] The thing is, I can see glimpses of her real house underneath all this—er, there's the piano where she taught me chopsticks, [trailing off] buried under garbage bags full of... I don't even know what. [sigh] And it's not like I can just throw everything away because, well, some of this might be important? [anxious] I found her wedding dress yesterday stuffed between moldy phonebooks and cat food cans she never even owned a cat for. 

[determined] But here's the thing—I need this house. Actually, I really need this house. [slowly] My lease is up next month and, um, underneath all this chaos is my childhood, sort of preserved in amber. [warm] Or preserved in old newspapers, anyway. [chuckle] So I guess I'm doing this. [exhausted] Fifty years of stuff, one overwhelmed granddaughter, and probably like seventeen dumpsters. Right?
710. [gasp] Oh my God, I just got off the call with the industry council and they're—they're actually doing it. The whole training program, like, every single module we developed is going nationwide. [laugh] I mean, honestly, when we started this thing two years ago in that tiny facility in Ohio, it was just—we were literally just trying to fix our own safety issues, you know? 

[shaky voice] And now they're saying, um, forty thousand workers are gonna be trained using our materials by next quarter. Forty thousand! That's—[pause]—I keep thinking about Carlos, actually. Remember how he lost his finger because nobody ever showed him the proper blade technique? [emotional] That's why we started all this, right? Because people were getting hurt and, I mean, the old training was basically "here's your hairnet, don't die."

[excited] But now it's like—wait, sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself—but the standardization committee said our injury rates dropped seventy percent! [speeding up] And they want me to present at the conference, and honestly I'm kind of terrified because what if—[trail off]

[warm] No, you know what? This is good. This is really, really good. We're gonna save fingers, er, save lives even. [chuckle] God, I need to call my mom.
711. [confused] Twenty-three percent. That's, um, that's what it says. Twenty-three percent Eastern European. Dad's—I mean, the man I've called Dad for thirty-two years is like, one hundred percent Irish. So that's... [pause] that's not possible, right? Unless—oh God. 

Well, I keep refreshing the page thinking maybe it's, you know, some kind of error. But it's not changing. [shaky voice] The thing is, Mom always said I had his eyes. Actually, everyone said that. "You look just like your father." Hmm, which father though, right? 

I guess I should—I don't even know what I should do. [cry] Call Mom? Basically demand she explain why she's been lying to me my entire life? Or, er, maybe she thought I knew? No, that's—that's ridiculous. 

[bitter] You know what's funny? I spent literally years defending him when people said we looked nothing alike. [whispering] "Genetics are weird," I'd say. Yeah, turns out they're pretty straightforward actually.

So now what? I mean, do I tell him? [anxious] Does he know? Has he always known? The thing is, he taught me to ride a bike, walked me down the aisle, held my daughter when she was born. [long pause] That's still real, right? Like, that happened. 

[very quietly] I just... I don't know who I am anymore.
712. Twenty-three years I've been at that plant. Twenty-three. [bitter] And for what, honestly? We organized, we—I mean, we really thought the union would actually back us this time. [frustrated] Like, we had the votes, you know? Everyone signed those cards, um, everyone showed up to the meetings even though they were scared. 

[sigh] Martinez got fired first, then basically half of second shift. And what did our rep say? [mocking] "We need to follow proper channels." Proper channels while, uh, while people are losing their houses? [angry] I can't even look at Rodriguez anymore, I told him—no wait, I promised him—that if we stuck together, err, if we all just stayed united... 

[very sad] His kid's got medical bills, and I stood there telling him the union would protect us. [pause] The thing is, I really believed it, you know? Like an idiot, I guess. [quietly] All those nights organizing, and then corporate just... they didn't even negotiate. Just pink slips. Done.

[exhausted] So now what, right? I'm fifty-two, and suddenly I'm supposed to just, what, start over? [bitter] "Retraining opportunities," they said. [laugh] Yeah, okay. Retraining for what exactly? [trailing off] I don't even know anymore...
713. [upset] Twenty hours. They're giving me twenty hours a week—that's, um, that's literally half what I was working. [frustrated] Right before Christmas, I mean, seriously? Like, who does that? [pause] I've been there for what, er, almost two years now, and this is how they—[bitter] "slow season" my ass. It's a bakery! People buy cookies and cakes for the holidays, right? 

[anxious] So now I'm just supposed to, what, figure out how to pay rent with half a paycheck? And I already told my niece I'd get her that, uhh, that art set she wanted, [sad] the expensive one with all the markers and... [sigh] God, I don't know.

[angry] You know what really gets me? They hired two new people last month. Two! And somehow I'm the one getting my hours cut? [shaky voice] I just—I honestly don't understand how this is even legal. 

[long pause] 

[exhausted] Maybe I should, like, start looking for something else. A second job or, I guess, just a whole new job entirely. [very quietly] The thing is, I actually liked working there. [sniffle] The smell of fresh bread in the morning, the regulars who knew my name... [trailing off] 

[determined] Whatever. I'll figure it out. I always do.
