=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so my account got... I got hacked. I guess. So.

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, um, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, we're going to get this completely sorted out for you, okay? I'm going to make sure we get you protected going forward too.

Customer [en]: Yeah okay okay. Um, I just... I just need to get back in.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, so, um, I think what we'll do first is, uh, let me see here... I'm generating a temporary access code TAC-9847-VN22 that I'll, um, send to your registered email. But actually, wait, is your email still secure?

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if... what if they changed that too?

Customer Support [en]: That's, um, that's actually a really good question, and I'm glad you're thinking about this. So let me, uh, verify your identity first with security question set SQ-4419-B, and then, hmm, I'm going to walk you through checking everything, sort of step by step, to make sure nothing else got compromised, okay?

Customer [en]: Let me see here... um, are you sure this will work?

Customer Support [en]: I understand you're worried, and, um, honestly that's totally normal in this situation. But yes, I've, uh, I've helped probably hundreds of customers through this exact process, and we're going to get your account back today, I promise.

Customer [en]: Okay okay okay. Just... just tell me what I need to do.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so, um, first I need to ask you the security question on file here, which is, uh, "What was your first pet's name?" And then, hmm, once we verify that, I'll send recovery code REC-77852-XK to your phone.

Customer [en]: Um, it's it's Whiskers. The pet. Whiskers.

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: So that means... hmm, that means you can fix it?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, absolutely, so, um, I'm sending that recovery code now to your phone ending in 4782, and, uh, while you're waiting for that, let me just, hmm, let me set up some extra protections here. I'm going to enable, um, two-factor authentication with code 2FA-8829-QM so this won't happen again.

Customer [en]: Um, okay I got I got the code. Now what?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect! So, uh, go ahead and read me that code, and then, hmm, I think what we should do is, um, immediately change your password and, uh, review all your recent account activity to see if they did anything else.

Customer [en]: It's um... let me see here... 5-5-9-3-7-2.

Customer Support [en]: Okay great, so I've, um, I've just reset your access with confirmation number CNF-10934-RT88, and, uh, you should be getting an email right now with a link to create your new password. But, hmm, I want to make sure you use something really strong this time, okay?

Customer [en]: Are you sure they can't just... just hack it again?

Customer Support [en]: So that's, um, that's exactly why I've added all these extra security layers, including, uh, login alerts with tracking ID TRK-6621-LP, and, hmm, I've also flagged your account for our security team to monitor for the next 30 days. You're going to be really well protected now, I promise. Nobody's getting back in there.
