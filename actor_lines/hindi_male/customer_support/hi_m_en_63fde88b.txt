=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Of course I can't figure this out, um, look I'm just trying to... the claim form doesn't make any sense...

Customer Support [en]: Oh hey no worries at all, so um, let me just, uh, pull up your file here real quick and basically we're gonna get this sorted, what's your claim number?

Customer [en]: Um, uh, I think it's... CL-4429 or maybe... I don't know, I'm probably reading it wrong...

Customer Support [en]: CL-4429, got it, perfect perfect, so like between you and me? These forms are basically designed by lawyers who've never actually had to fill one out themselves.

Customer [en]: Yeah well I work construction not... paperwork, so...

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so um, here's what we're gonna do, uh, I'm looking at your form now and basically the tricky part is just section three, everything else you've got spot on.

Customer [en]: Section three is the one about... I mean I don't even know what "proximate cause" means...

Customer Support [en]: So um, okay okay, uh, proximate cause is just fancy talk for like "what actually broke," so in your case with the, hmm, water damage claim WD-7792-XK, you just put "pipe burst."

Customer [en]: That's it? Just... pipe burst? Why don't they just say that then instead of...

Customer Support [en]: Um, exactly exactly, so like, uh, here's the insider trick, whenever they use big words just think "what would I tell my buddy at the bar" and um, that's basically your answer.

Customer [en]: Um, uh, okay but then there's this whole thing about, er, "itemized losses" and I just... of course I don't have receipts from five years ago...

Customer Support [en]: Oh oh oh, so between you and me? Put "see attached contractor estimate" and um, I'll mark your account EST-9906-APPROVED so like, uh, they won't even ask for receipts.

Customer [en]: Wait you can just... do that?

Customer Support [en]: So um, technically I'm using override code OVR-445-X which is for, uh, "special circumstances" but like, your job involves actual work not filing paperwork so, yeah, we're doing it.

Customer [en]: I mean, um, I should probably know this stuff, it's just... every box leads to another box and then...

Customer Support [en]: No no no, so like, uh, even I need the manual half the time and um, this is literally my job, so don't even worry bout it.

Customer [en]: Um, er, there's also this part about "subrogation rights" which sounds like... I don't know, something medical...

Customer Support [en]: So basically, um, subrogation just means like, uh, "can we sue someone else for this," so if it's just wear and tear or weather, you check "no" on form section SUB-412-B.

Customer [en]: Of course they make it sound scarier than... alright, no on that one then...

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect, so um, once you send that back with reference number REF-8823-CLAIM, uh, you're all set and like, next time? Just call me direct at ext 7794, skip the whole menu thing.
