Customer [en]: Look. I've been—no wait. Um. My tips. They're wrong. Again.

Customer Support [en]: Um okay so uh let me just uh pull up your profile here real quick and um I'll need your employee ID if you uh have that handy?

Customer [en]: It's, uh... what's the... 4-4-7. No. 4-7-7. Sorry. 2-9.

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it so that's 477-29 and um I'm seeing here uh your last report was submitted for period ending uh December 15th with a total of uh $347.50 in tips reported is that what we're um looking at?

Customer [en]: No! That's—I mean, sort of? But they took. More. Out.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay um so uh let me dig deeper here and uh I can see transaction TXN-9847-B3 shows uh a withholding of $89.42 but um there's also this other deduction here that's uh kind of unusual...

Customer [en]: Eighty nine? I think it was... probably like... ninety something?

Customer Support [en]: Um yeah so uh actually you're right there's uh another line item here for $3.78 that got um coded separately under reference REF-5521-QK and uh that's definitely not supposed to be there so um let me just...

Customer [en]: Wait. You found it? The extra. Thing?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah yeah um so basically what happened is uh the system double-processed part of your tip allocation and um it created this duplicate withholding entry DUP-7739-XX that uh shouldn't exist at all so um I can fix this right now.

Customer [en]: I've been. Um. Calling about this. For probably... what's it been... three weeks?

Customer Support [en]: Oh man um I'm so sorry about that and uh looking at your case history CAS-8823-PP I can see uh yeah three calls and um nobody caught this duplicate entry which is uh really frustrating I know.

Customer [en]: So you can. Actually. Fix it? Like right now?

Customer Support [en]: Um absolutely yes so uh I'm processing adjustment ADJ-6677-RT right now and uh you'll see that $3.78 credited back plus um we're also gonna add a correction credit of uh $15 for the inconvenience code CRD-9901-ZM.

Customer [en]: Oh. Um. Wow. That's... I mean, that's really... thank you.

Customer Support [en]: It's going to be okay now um the credit hits your next check and uh I've also flagged your account with note NTE-4455-JY so um this won't happen again basically the system will skip that duplicate process.

Customer [en]: The fifteen? That's—you didn't have to. I mean. Thank you. Really.

Customer Support [en]: Um of course of course and uh just so you know going forward if you see anything weird with tips just uh reference this ticket TKT-2234-BB and um we'll know exactly what to look for.

Customer [en]: Um, this is like... you actually listened. And found it. Nobody else, uh... sort of... bothered.

Customer Support [en]: Hey um I get it I really do and uh tip reporting is confusing enough without the system messing up so um yeah just keep that confirmation CON-8856-AA and uh you should see everything fixed by Thursday latest.
