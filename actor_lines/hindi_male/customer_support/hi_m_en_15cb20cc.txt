Customer [en]: I need information about your commercial gym equipment lease financing options. What terms are available?

Customer Support [en]: Good afternoon, and thank you for your interest in our equipment financing. We offer several flexible lease terms ranging from 24 to 60 months, with competitive rates starting at 4.9% APR for qualified businesses.

Customer [en]: What documentation do I need to apply?

Customer Support [en]: For our standard application process, you'll need your business tax ID, two years of financial statements, and a completed application form APP-2024-LEASE-7823. I can email that to you immediately if you'd like.

Customer [en]: Yes, send it. What's the typical approval timeframe?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. Most applications receive preliminary approval within 24 to 48 hours, with final approval and funding completed within 5 business days of receiving all documentation.

Customer [en]: I'm looking at approximately $75,000 in equipment. What would monthly payments look like?

Customer Support [en]: For a $75,000 lease amount, assuming a 48-month term at our standard rate of 5.2%, your monthly payment would be approximately $1,735, though this can vary based on your credit profile and down payment options.

Customer [en]: Do you require a down payment?

Customer Support [en]: We offer both options. Our zero-down program is available for businesses with strong credit profiles, typically those with scores above 680, or you can reduce your monthly payment with 10% to 20% down through program FIN-FLEX-2024.

Customer [en]: I have excellent credit. What additional benefits come with the zero-down option?

Customer Support [en]: Excellent. With your strong credit profile, you'd qualify for our Premier Business package PRM-BUS-847, which includes zero down payment, potential rate reduction to 4.9%, and the ability to add equipment to your lease within the first 90 days.

Customer [en]: Can I purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. All our leases include a purchase option at fair market value, typically 10% to 15% of original cost, or you can choose our $1 buyout lease option under agreement type LEASE-BO-001 for predetermined ownership.

Customer [en]: What's the difference in monthly payments between those two options?

Customer Support [en]: Of course. For your $75,000 lease, the fair market value option would be approximately $1,735 monthly, while the $1 buyout option runs about $1,890 monthly over 48 months, reference calculation ID CALC-75K-4824.

Customer [en]: I'll take the application for the fair market value option. What's your email?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect choice. I'll send the application to your email immediately. May I have your preferred email address and business name for our records?

Customer [en]: It's mthompson@eliteperformancetraining.com. Elite Performance Training LLC.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I've sent the application to your email along with reference number REF-EPT-112024-A. You should receive it within five minutes, and I'll follow up tomorrow to assist with any questions about the application process.
