=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I need to switch from electronic statements to paper statements for my account immediately.

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I can help you with that change today. May I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer [en]: The account number is the one ending in four-seven-three-nine.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I'm pulling up account 88294739 now, and I can see you've been enrolled in electronic statements since March 2022.

Customer [en]: Correct. I need physical copies for tax documentation purposes going forward.

Customer Support [en]: I understand completely. Many customers require paper statements for record-keeping, and I can activate that service effective with your next statement cycle on the 15th.

Customer [en]: Will I receive the past three months retroactively as well?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I can generate paper copies of your last 3 statements, which cover June through August, and mail those within 5 business days.

Customer [en]: Perfect. What address will those be sent to?

Customer Support [en]: They'll be mailed to your registered address at 4521 Oak Boulevard, Suite 200, unless you need them sent elsewhere.

Customer [en]: That address is correct. Can you confirm the timeline once more?

Customer Support [en]: Of course.

Customer [en]: And there's no additional fee for switching to paper statements?

Customer Support [en]: Your account type, Premier Business Plus, includes paper statements at no charge, so you won't see any additional fees on your monthly service charge of $29.95.

Customer [en]: Excellent. How will I know the change has been processed?

Customer Support [en]: You'll receive confirmation email within 2 hours to your registered email address, and the retroactive statements will arrive via USPS Priority Mail with tracking number.

Customer [en]: That works perfectly. Will future statements arrive before the payment due date?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, statements generate on the 15th of each month and typically arrive 3 to 5 business days later, giving you at least 10 days before your payment due date.

Customer [en]: Thank you. This resolves everything I needed today.

Customer Support [en]: You're very welcome. I've completed the change to paper statements effective immediately, and your confirmation number is REF-82947-STMT for your records.
