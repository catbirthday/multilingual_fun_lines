=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi, I just got my bill and it's, uh, it's three times what it usually... I don't understand what's...

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear that's—let me just—actually, can I get your account number first? It should be, uh, at the top of your bill, starts with ACC.

Customer [en]: ACC-4982. Look, I'm a single mom, I can't afford this.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm pulling up ACC-4982 here and, uh, oh wow, I see what you mean about the increase, that's—I'm really sorry, that must be, um, really stressful.

Customer [en]: Can you just, um, tell me why it's... what's the word... why it jumped like that?

Customer Support [en]: Right, so I can see here that your usage for billing period BIL-2024-03 shows 2,847 kilowatt hours which is definitely—I mean, that's significantly higher than your average.

Customer [en]: But we didn't do anything diff— um, I mean, nothing changed, so how is that even...

Customer Support [en]: I understand, I really do, and um, sometimes there can be—actually, let me check—okay so I'm seeing meter reading MR-73921-X was done on the 15th, and uh, it looks like they had been estimating your bills before.

Customer [en]: Estimating? So they just, um, guessed wrong and now I'm... of course. Of course this happens.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, um, I know this is—look, I'm really sorry about this, but basically when they do actual readings after estimates, sometimes there's a, uh, catch-up adjustment in billing cycle CYC-4982-Q3.

Customer [en]: A catch-up? That's just... fantastic. Really great.

Customer Support [en]: I can hear how frustrated you are and, um, honestly? I think it's—I mean, the system shouldn't work this way, it's not fair to customers, especially when you're budgeting and then suddenly get hit with adjustment ADJ-9982-7.

Customer [en]: Um, so what am I supposed to, uh, actually do here? I literally can't pay this.

Customer Support [en]: Okay, so—and I really want to help you here—um, we have a payment plan option, reference code PAY-PLAN-88K, where we can spread this over, uh, I think up to six months?

Customer [en]: Six months of... and then next month's bill too, so that's, um, that's still...

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: I just, um, don't understand how they can just, uh, estimate wrong and then I'm the one who...

Customer Support [en]: No, you're absolutely right, and um, between you and me? I see this happen way too often with meter corrections like COR-4421-B, and I always feel terrible because—I mean, how are people supposed to plan for this?

Customer [en]: Exactly. Um, the payment plan, is there a... what's it... a fee for that?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, actually—and this is some good news at least—there's no fee for plan enrollment PLE-7736-X, and uh, I can even backdate it to avoid any late charges, which, um, technically I'm supposed to get supervisor approval for but honestly, given what happened here with the estimates...
