=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [mix]: I'm calling about unexpected fees on my account, जो signup के वक्त पिछले महीने बिल्कुल mention नहीं किए गए थे।

Customer Support [mix]: I understand your concern about unexpected charges. मैं तुरंत आपका account details निकालता हूँ। क्या आप अपना account number या फिर service से जुड़ा phone number दे सकते हैं?

Customer [mix]: The account number is 4472-8891. मैंने enrollment के दौरान specifically सभी fees के बारे में पूछा था।

Customer Support [mix]: Thank you. मेरे पास आपका account है, जो October 12th को Premium Plan पर $79.99 monthly के साथ activate हुआ था। मुझे आपकी पहली statement में तीन additional charges दिख रहे हैं।

Customer [mix]: Exactly. Sales call के दौरान या confirmation email में किसी ने भी इनका जिक्र नहीं किया था।

Customer Support [mix]: I apologize for that oversight. जो charges मुझे दिख रहे हैं वो हैं $15.00 का regulatory recovery fee, $9.99 का equipment protection fee, और $4.95 का administrative fee, कुल मिलाकर $29.94 के additional monthly charges हैं।

Customer [mix]: Those fees represent nearly forty percent above the quoted price. ये बिल्कुल गलत है, पूरी तरह से unacceptable है।

Customer Support [mix]: You're absolutely right to be concerned about this discrepancy. मैं आपका October 12th दोपहर 2:47 PM वाला enrollment call recording check करता हूँ, ताकि verify कर सकूं कि signup के दौरान क्या information दी गई थी।

Customer [mix]: Please do. मेरे पास उस conversation के अपने notes यहीं हैं।

Customer Support [mix]: I've completed my review. आप बिल्कुल सही कह रहे हैं, हमारे representative ने October 12th के enrollment call में ये standard fees itemize करने में चूक की, जो हमारी full disclosure policy का उल्लंघन है।

Customer [mix]: What options do I have to resolve this? मैं चाहता हूँ कि ये तुरंत ठीक हो।

Customer Support [mix]: Absolutely. मैं आपको दो resolution options offer करने के लिए authorized हूँ। पहला, मैं आपके account में $89.82 का credit कर सकता हूँ, जो तीन महीने के इन fees को cover करेगा, जब तक आप full fee awareness के साथ service continue करने का फैसला लेते हैं।

Customer [mix]: What's the second option? मैं decide करने से पहले सब कुछ सुनना चाहता हूँ।

Customer Support [mix]: Certainly. दूसरा option है आपको Essential Plan पर $49.99 monthly के साथ transition करना, जिसमें सिर्फ $5.00 का regulatory fee है, जो आपकी current total charges के मुकाबले लगभग $24.94 per month की बचत करेगा।

Customer [mix]: If I keep my current plan with the credit, क्या ये fees आगे जाकर waive हो सकते हैं?

Customer Support [mix]: I can permanently waive the equipment protection fee of $9.99 monthly, क्योंकि वो optional है। Regulatory और administrative fees जो कुल $19.95 हैं, वो सभी Premium Plan accounts में standard हैं और long-term waive नहीं हो सकते।

Customer [mix]: Then apply the three-month credit, और equipment protection fee को permanently हटा दीजिए।

Customer Support [mix]: Perfect. मैंने आपके account में CR-7746-XM reference के साथ $89.82 का credit apply कर दिया है और equipment protection को permanently remove कर दिया है, जिससे November 12th के आपके next cycle से आपका monthly bill $99.89 हो जाएगा।

Customer [mix]: Good. कृपया मुझे इन changes और credit का written confirmation email कर दीजिए।

Customer Support [mix]: Of course. मैं अभी वो confirmation आपके registered email address पर भेज रहा हूँ जो -tech.com पर खत्म होता है। आपको 5 minutes के अंदर मिल जाएगा, और उसमें reference number CR-7746-XM और आज discuss किए गए सभी adjustments शामिल होंगे।


=== Original (English) ===

Customer: I'm calling about unexpected fees on my account that weren't disclosed when I signed up last month.

Customer Support: I understand your concern about unexpected charges. Let me pull up your account details right away. May I have your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: The account number is 4472-8891. I specifically asked about all fees during enrollment.

Customer Support: Thank you. I have your account here, showing activation on October 12th under our Premium Plan at $79.99 monthly. I can see three additional charges that posted to your first statement.

Customer: Exactly. Nobody mentioned those during the sales call or in the confirmation email.

Customer Support: I apologize for that oversight. The charges I'm seeing are a $15.00 regulatory recovery fee, a $9.99 equipment protection fee, and a $4.95 administrative fee, totaling $29.94 in additional monthly charges.

Customer: Those fees represent nearly forty percent above the quoted price. This is unacceptable.

Customer Support: You're absolutely right to be concerned about this discrepancy. Let me review your enrollment call recording from October 12th at 2:47 PM to verify what information was provided during your signup process.

Customer: Please do. I have my own notes from that conversation right here.

Customer Support: I've completed my review. You're correct that our representative failed to itemize these standard fees during your enrollment call on October 12th, which violates our full disclosure policy.

Customer: What options do I have to resolve this? I expect this to be corrected.

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm authorized to offer you two resolution options. First, I can credit your account $89.82, covering three months of these fees, while you decide whether to continue service with full fee awareness.

Customer: What's the second option? I want to hear everything before deciding.

Customer Support: Certainly. The second option is transitioning you to our Essential Plan at $49.99 monthly, which has only a $5.00 regulatory fee, saving you approximately $24.94 per month compared to your current total charges.

Customer: If I keep my current plan with the credit, can these fees be waived going forward?

Customer Support: I can permanently waive the equipment protection fee of $9.99 monthly, as that's optional. The regulatory and administrative fees totaling $19.95 are standard across all Premium Plan accounts and cannot be waived long-term.

Customer: Then apply the three-month credit and remove the equipment protection fee permanently.

Customer Support: Perfect. I've applied credit reference CR-7746-XM for $89.82 to your account and removed the equipment protection permanently, reducing your monthly bill to $99.89 starting with your next cycle on November 12th.

Customer: Good. Please email me written confirmation of these changes and the credit.

Customer Support: Of course. I'm sending that confirmation now to your registered email address ending in -tech.com. You'll receive it within 5 minutes, and it will include reference number CR-7746-XM and all adjustments we've discussed today.
