=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitant] Sameer? God, is that really you standing there? मुझे पहले यकीन नहीं आ रहा था लेकिन फिर तुमने सिर घुमाया और, अम्म, जिस तरह से तुम बाल कान के पीछे करते हो, बचपन से यही आदत है तुम्हारी।

Character 2 [mix]: Dad. [sharp inhale] I didn't think I'd— यार, तुम इतने अलग लग रहे हो, मैं तो बिना पहचाने ही निकल जाता।

Character 1 [mix]: [voice cracking] Seven years, beta. सात साल से सोच रहा था कि तुम ठीक हो या नहीं, कॉलेज पूरा किया या नहीं, अभी भी, मेरा मतलब, नफरत करते हो मुझसे जो मैंने तुम्हारे और तुम्हारी माँ के साथ किया।

Character 2 [mix]: Mom doesn't know I'm here. माँ को पता नहीं है।

Character 1 [mix]: Yeah, I figured as much. अभी भी वो restraining order है ना? [bitter laugh] वैसे क्या फर्क पड़ता है जब तुम्हारे पास कोई पता ही नहीं हो जहाँ से तुम्हें, पता है ना, दूर रखा जाए।

Character 2 [mix]: [defensively] She had her reasons, Dad. तुम शराब में अपनी जान गंवा रहे थे और सबको अपने साथ ले डूब रहे थे, और मैं सबसे बड़ा था तो मुझे देखना पड़ता था छोटे बच्चों को रोते हुए कि पापा कहाँ गए।

Character 1 [mix]: I know, sweetheart, I know. [exhales heavily] करीब तीन साल हो गए हैं, अम्म, sober हूँ, पर इससे कुछ ठीक तो नहीं होता ना, वो वक्त वापस नहीं आता जो मैंने तुम बच्चों के साथ खोया।

Character 2 [mix]: [softer] Three years? सच में?

Character 1 [mix]: October fifteenth will be three years, yeah. शेल्टर में downtown एक प्रोग्राम मिला था, वहाँ एक counselor है जो, हम्म, तुम्हारी बकवास बहानों को बर्दाश्त नहीं करता। [quiet laugh]

Character 2 [mix]: [wavering] The little ones still ask about you sometimes. छोटे अभी भी कभी-कभी तुम्हारे बारे में पूछते हैं।

Character 1 [mix]: They do? सब कुछ के बाद भी? यार, मुझे लगा था अब तक तो मेरी शक्ल भूल गए होंगे, खासकर Benji, वो तो बहुत छोटा था जब मैं—जब सब बिखर गया था।

Character 2 [mix]: [steadier] Benji's eleven now, plays baseball like you used to. तुम्हारा वही स्विंग है उसमें, बैट मारने से पहले वो छोटा सा रुकना, अम्म, सच में अजीब लगता है उसे बैटिंग करते देखना।

Character 1 [mix]: Eleven. [voice breaking] मेरा छोटा बच्चा अब 11 साल का है और शायद याद भी नहीं होगा जब मैंने उसे backyard में बैट पकड़ना सिखाया था, उस गर्मी में जब सब कुछ बर्बाद होने से पहले।

Character 2 [mix]: He remembers more than you think. उसे तुम्हारी सोच से ज्यादा याद है।

Character 1 [mix]: [carefully] And you? तुम्हें क्या याद है, Sameer? क्योंकि मुझे पता है आखिरी कुछ सालों में मैं कोई अच्छा बाप नहीं था, लेकिन उससे पहले, कुछ अच्छे पल थे हमारे, है ना?

Character 2 [mix]: [emotional] I remember you reading me stories until I fell asleep, even when you were exhausted from work. याद है Sunday को डायनासोर के शेप में पैनकेक बनाते थे और हमेशा, मेरा मतलब, पहला batch जला देते थे लेकिन कहते थे crispy होना चाहिए था।

Character 1 [mix]: [tearful laugh] You always ate those burnt ones anyway, कहता था तेरे favourite हैं क्योंकि ज्यादा crunchy हैं। यार, कितना अच्छा बच्चा था तू, मेरी खराब cooking पर भी मुझे अच्छा feel कराने की कोशिश करता था।

Character 2 [mix]: The bus is coming, Dad. [pause] मैं यह route लेता हूँ हर Tuesday और Thursday अपनी community college की classes के बाद, तो, अम्म, शायद फिर मिलेंगे यहाँ कभी।

Character 1 [mix]: [hopeful] Tuesday and Thursday, around this time? हाँ, मैं— मेरा मतलब, मैं usually इस area में होता ही हूँ, तो शायद फिर मिल जाएं, अगर तुम्हें ठीक लगे।

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] Take care of yourself, Dad. और, अम्म, congratulations तीन साल के लिए। [voice catching] सच में बहुत बड़ी बात है। बहुत, बहुत बड़ी बात है।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [hesitant] Sarah? God, is that really you standing there? I wasn't sure at first but then you turned your head and, um, the way you tuck your hair behind your ear, you've done that since you were little.

Character 2: Dad. [sharp inhale] I didn't think I'd— Jesus, you look so different, I almost walked right past you without even knowing.

Character 1: [voice cracking] Seven years, baby girl. Seven years of wondering if you were okay, if you finished school, if you, er, still hate me for everything I put you and your mother through.

Character 2: Mom doesn't know I'm here.

Character 1: Yeah, I figured as much. She probably still has that restraining order, right? [bitter laugh] Not that it matters when you don't have an address for them to, you know, restrain you from.

Character 2: [defensively] She had her reasons, Dad. You were drinking yourself to death and taking everyone down with you, and I was the oldest so I had to watch the little ones cry themselves to sleep wondering where you went.

Character 1: I know, sweetheart, I know. [exhales heavily] Been sober for, um, almost three years now, not that it fixes anything or brings back the time I lost with you kids.

Character 2: [softer] Three years? Really?

Character 1: October fifteenth will be three years, yeah. Found a program at the shelter downtown, they have this counselor who, hmm, doesn't let you get away with your usual bullshit excuses. [quiet laugh]

Character 2: [wavering] The little ones still ask about you sometimes.

Character 1: They do? Even after everything? Man, I thought for sure they'd have forgotten my face by now, especially Benji, he was so young when I—when things fell apart.

Character 2: [steadier] Benji's eleven now, plays baseball like you used to. Has your swing, that little hitch before he connects, it's, um, kind of eerie actually watching him at bat.

Character 1: Eleven. [voice breaking] My baby boy is eleven and probably doesn't even remember me teaching him to hold a bat in the backyard that summer before everything went to hell.

Character 2: He remembers more than you think.

Character 1: [carefully] And you? What do you remember, Sarah? Because I know I wasn't much of a father those last few years, but before that, we had some good times, didn't we?

Character 2: [emotional] I remember you reading me stories until I fell asleep, even when you were exhausted from work. I remember Sunday pancakes shaped like dinosaurs and how you'd, er, always burn the first batch but pretend they were supposed to be crispy.

Character 1: [tearful laugh] You always ate those burnt ones anyway, said they were your favorite because they had more crunch. God, you were such a good kid, trying to make me feel better about my terrible cooking.

Character 2: The bus is coming, Dad. [pause] I take this route every Tuesday and Thursday after my classes at the community college, so, um, maybe I'll see you around here again sometime.

Character 1: [hopeful] Tuesday and Thursday, around this time? Yeah, I'll— I mean, I'm usually in this area anyway, so maybe our paths might cross again, if that's okay with you.

Character 2: [gently] Take care of yourself, Dad. And, um, congratulations on the three years. That's really something. [voice catching] That's really, really something.
