=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Sarah, is that you sleeping in that, [concerned], Honda with the broken tail light because I saw movement when I, [gentle], pulled into the parking lot this morning?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Mrs. Henderson, please don't call anyone because I'm just, [embarrassed], waiting for the school to open so Katie can, [desperate], get to her kindergarten class and I promise we'll be, [voice breaking], gone before anyone notices.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] You were one of my brightest students ten years ago and now you're, [pained], living in your car with a five-year-old which means something went, [heavy], terribly wrong.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Well, um, you know, life doesn't always follow the lesson plans we, [hollow], studied in your classroom, I mean, sometimes it just, [defeated], falls apart. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] I remember, um, how you used to write these beautiful essays about, well, [nostalgic], changing the world and making a difference, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Those essays didn't prepare me for a husband who, [trembling], emptied our bank account and disappeared or landlords who don't care that, [broken], you work three jobs but still can't make rent when your daughter gets, [crying], sick and medical bills pile up.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] The school has resources and programs that could, [encouraging], help you get back on your feet if you'd let me make some calls.

Character 2 [en]: [resistant] I don't need charity from the school where my daughter has to, [proud], pretend everything's normal while we wash up in gas station bathrooms.

Character 1 [en]: Sarah, this isn't charity, it's what communities do when someone's, [warm], drowning and too proud to reach for the life preserver right, [urgent], in front of them.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] Um, I just, well, I don't know how to explain to Katie that, [ashamed], her mom can't even provide a real home anymore, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Katie needs, um, I mean, a safe place more than she needs you to, [wise], be perfect, well, and pride won't keep her warm tonight.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Mrs. Henderson, um, I'm so tired of fighting and, well, [breaking down], pretending that tomorrow will somehow be different when I know, you know, [defeated], it won't be. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, um, tonight will be different because you're both staying at, [firm], my guest house and I won't hear any arguments about it, I mean, [maternal], some battles you don't fight alone, you know? [resolute]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] You barely know me anymore and you're offering to, [disbelieving], open your home to someone who failed at everything you, [emotional], taught was possible.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] I know that the seventeen-year-old who cried in my classroom about, [remembering], wanting to be a social worker is still in there somewhere, and I know Katie deserves to see her, [hopeful], mom rebuild rather than just survive.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] What if I mess this up too because I've gotten so good at, [fearful], disappointing people who believe in me that it feels like, [broken whisper], the only thing I know how to do anymore, [shaking], even when I try my hardest?

Character 1 [en]: [fierce] Then we try again.

Character 2 [en]: [crying softly] Um, well, I don't even know what to say except, you know, [grateful], thank you for seeing something in me that I, [overwhelmed], lost a long time ago, I mean, thank you.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] Sarah, um, I've watched hundreds of students graduate but, well, [emotional], I never stop wondering what happens when life gets hard, and I mean, [determined], I refuse to let you become one of the ones who just, [voice breaking], disappears. [firmly]

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Maybe Katie won't have to remember this time when, [hopeful], her mom hit rock bottom but instead the morning when, [strengthening], someone reminded us that we're worth saving even when we, [tearful], can't save ourselves. [exhales deeply]
