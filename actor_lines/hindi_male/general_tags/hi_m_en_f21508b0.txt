=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confrontational] Stop right there.

Character 2 [en]: I don't know what you're, [panicked], talking about and I really need to get to class right now. [nervous laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [furious] I know you've been, um, [shaking], following me for weeks and selling those, [disgusted], photos to tabloids saying I'm the real celebrity when, well, [bitter], you know damn well I'm just trying to make a living.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, you dress exactly, [desperate], like them and hang out at all the same places so what's the, [trembling], difference really?

Character 1 [en]: [hurt] The difference is that my entire career as a lookalike gets, [voice cracking], destroyed when people find out those aren't real celebrity photos. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] Well, um, I needed the money for tuition and, [ashamed], nobody was getting hurt since, er, [quiet], the magazines didn't seem to care anyway. [mumbles]

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You've already cost me three, [defeated], corporate event bookings because clients think I'm some kind of, [hollow], fraud who stages fake paparazzi shots for, [disgusted], attention. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: I mean, I didn't realize it would, [regretful], affect your actual job opportunities like that, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Do you understand that impersonating celebrities at parties and, [breaking], charity events is literally how I pay my rent and that your little, [angry], side hustle is taking food off my, [desperate], table?

Character 2 [en]: Okay, um, maybe we could, [calculating], work something out where I pay you a cut or, [nervous], we could even stage better photos together since, well, [hopeful], you're really good at the whole impersonation thing. [trails off]

Character 1 [en]: [incredulous] So, um, now you want me to be, [sarcastic], complicit in defrauding the same magazines that are, well, [frustrated], already ruining my reputation?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Um, wait, I mean—

Character 1 [en]: [firm] I've already contacted my lawyer about this and, um, [measured], she says what you're doing constitutes fraud and harassment which means, [serious], you could lose a lot more than just your, well, [pointed], part-time tuition money if I press charges.

Character 2 [en]: [panicking] Please, um, don't do that because I'll, [frantic], delete everything right now, I mean, all the photos and accounts.

Character 1 [en]: [cold] You need to, um, write a signed confession about what you've been doing and, [calculating], send retractions to every outlet you've sold to or, well, [threatening], I'm going straight to the police station after this conversation, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Jesus, okay, um, I'll do whatever you want but please understand that I was, [broken], just trying to survive school and I never meant to, er, [tearful], destroy someone else's life in the process. [voice breaks]

Character 1 [en]: [tired] Just fix this.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] I'll go to the magazines today and tell them, [defeated], everything about how I've been lying to them and, um, [exhausted], make sure they know you had nothing to do with it, I mean, any of it.

Character 1 [en]: [warning] If I see one more photo or even hear a, [stern], whisper about this continuing, there won't be a, [dark], second chance for you to make this, [final], right.

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] I understand completely and I'm genuinely, [remorseful], sorry for everything I've put you through. [sighs]
