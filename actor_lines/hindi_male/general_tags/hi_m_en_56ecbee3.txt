=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [steady] I brought the trust documents you requested but watching you, [trembling], tear down our childhood home makes me wonder if, [breaking], Dad would have wanted his legacy reduced to, [hollow], rubble and permits. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Every beam in this house holds, [bitter], memories of his disappointment when I chose engineering over law, every wall echoes with, [cracking], arguments about wasted potential, but you wouldn't understand because you were always, [resentful], the perfect daughter.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, um, being perfect meant never getting to, [exhausted], fail or experiment or dream beyond what he expected, and I mean, [envious], watching you rebel even if it hurt was like, you know, [wistful], watching someone else live the life I was too afraid to want.

Character 2 [en]: The revolutionary housing project I'm building here will, um, [proud], shelter fifty families who could never afford homes otherwise, which is, I mean, [measured], more than Dad ever did with his hoarded wealth, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [careful] The trust stipulates that both beneficiaries must, [clinical], agree to any demolition of family property, which means legally you, [firm], need my signature before another wall comes down, and we both know I could, [threatening], stop this today.

Character 2 [en]: [weary] So, um, are you here as my sister who used to, [nostalgic], build blanket forts with me in the attic, or, well, as the trust officer who needs to, you know, enforce Dad's rules from beyond the grave?

Character 1 [en]: [struggling] I'm here as someone who, um, [lost], doesn't know how to be either anymore because being your sister means, well, [searching], betraying my duties and being the trust officer means, you know, [torn], betraying the only family I have left, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Remember when we carved our initials, [tender], into that oak beam in the basement?

Character 1 [en]: It's still there beneath, um, [choked], seventeen coats of paint. [crying softly]

Character 2 [en]: [hesitant] Well, I mean, I've been cutting around that beam for three days because, [vulnerable], I couldn't bring myself to destroy the only proof that we were once, um, [aching], close enough to share secrets and dreams before Dad's money and expectations, you know, [heavy], tore us apart. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] Um, what if we saved that beam and incorporated it into, [hopeful], your new building somewhere, as like a cornerstone or, well, [brightening], something that honors where we came from while still, you know, [warming], letting you build something better?

Character 2 [en]: That would mean you'd have to, [surprised], sign the papers. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] Well, I already signed them this morning, um, before I came here because I realized, you know, holding onto this house means holding onto his control over us.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] Then why did you, um, [confused], let me think you might stop the demolition, I mean, why put us both through this?

Character 1 [en]: [sincere] Because I needed to know if destroying this house meant, [searching], destroying us too.

Character 2 [en]: [emotional] You know, um, every family that moves into these homes will see that beam with our initials, [overwhelmed], and maybe they'll carve their own stories into it, and well, [hopeful], that feels like the legacy Dad never understood how to build. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Um, yeah.

Character 2 [en]: It doesn't.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] I want to invest my portion of the trust into, well, [determined], your project, if you'll let me, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [softening] Um, that would make you my business partner, which, I mean, [contemplative], might be easier than learning how to be siblings again, you know.
