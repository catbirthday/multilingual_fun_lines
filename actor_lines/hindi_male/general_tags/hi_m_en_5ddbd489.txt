=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] This burn pattern on the neck—I've seen this, [trembling], exact damage before in photos from the Riverside Arena, [barely breathing], the night of the fire.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] It's just, um, an old guitar that needs, [tense], fixing, so maybe we should, uh, stick to discussing the repair costs, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [shaking] You're him, aren't you—the one who, um, went back into that burning venue, [voice breaking], five times to pull people out before the whole stage collapsed, [choked up], and then just, er, vanished from the world. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [harsh] Look, I don't know what, um, stories you've heard, but I'm just, [frustrated], a customer who needs a guitar fixed, and, well, that's all this is, [firm], okay? [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] My sister was one of the people you, [overwhelmed], carried out that night—she still has the scar on her arm from where you, [grateful], gripped her so tight to keep her from falling through the, [voice cracking], burning floor.

Character 2 [en]: [pained] Please, I mean, just stop—I can't, [struggling], do this again, not here in some, um, guitar shop where I just wanted to, [desperate], get this thing repaired without anyone knowing who I, er, used to be. [groans]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] She never forgot.

Character 2 [en]: Every single night I still smell that, [haunted], smoke and hear those screams echoing through my dreams.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] You saved forty-three people that night, [measured], and then disappeared because you couldn't handle being called a, [understanding], hero. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Heroes don't leave seven people behind because the, [breaking], ceiling came down—heroes don't have to live with choosing who to, [anguished], save and who to let, [hollow], die.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] My sister told me about how you went back for that little girl even though your, [emotional], hands were already burned so badly you could barely, [intense], grip the door handles, and you still carried her out on your, [proud], back.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] That little girl's mother was still, [heavy], inside when the whole thing came down—I can still see her, [haunted], face in the window.

Character 1 [en]: Stop punishing yourself.

Character 2 [en]: You don't, um, understand what it's like to be treated like some kind of, well, saint when all I, er, did was what anyone would do, you know? [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Um, well, anyone wouldn't.

Character 2 [en]: I just wanted to play, um, music again without people, [raw], staring at me like I'm some kind of, er, monument to that awful night instead of just, [defeated], a person trying to move forward, you know? [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [steady] Then let me fix this guitar so you can, [sincere], play again.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Every time I try to play, um, my hands start, [shaking], trembling because they remember the heat, and I, well, can't make it through a single song anymore.

Character 1 [en]: We'll work on it together—no rush, [compassionate], no pressure.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Maybe if I could just, [uncertain], play one song again without seeing their faces, [yearning], without feeling that heat, then maybe I could finally, [desperate], forgive myself. [long pause]
