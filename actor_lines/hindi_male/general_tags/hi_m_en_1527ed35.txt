=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] You look good.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah? [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: The newspapers made it sound like you were, I don't know, broken or something, but you seem alright, considering everything that happened that night.

Character 2 [en]: [flatly] Three years in here gives you time to think about what 'alright' means, Tommy, and trust me, it's not what you see sitting across from you.

Character 1 [en]: [shifting uncomfortably] Look, I know I haven't visited before now, and that's on me, but I needed to make sure the heat died down first. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [leaning forward] The heat? You mean the investigation into your illegal fight ring, or the fact that you bet against me that night? [cold laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I never bet against you, Jesus, is that what you think happened? I lost everything when you went down—my reputation, my stable of fighters, everything.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly venomous] You lost your reputation? I killed a man with my bare hands because you promised me it was just another exhibition match, not some death match for rich psychopaths.

Character 1 [en]: [voice breaking] I didn't know they'd remove the rules, I swear to God, they told me it was standard underground, three rounds, basic safety protocols still in place. [shaky exhale]

Character 2 [en]: [softer suddenly] You really didn't know? Because when they locked that cage door and told us only one walks out, I kept looking at you, waiting for you to stop it. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: I tried—Christ, I tried everything, screaming at the organizers, threatening to call the cops, but they had guns on me too, said we were both dead if I interfered.

Character 2 [en]: [hollow] So you just watched while I beat that kid to death, watched me become the monster you always said I could be if I just 'let go' in the ring.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] That's not what I meant when I said that, and you know it—I meant controlled aggression, not... not what happened that night.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah well, turns out there's no controlling it once you cross that line, once you feel someone's life leave through your fists. [pause] Why are you really here, Tommy?

Character 1 [en]: [reluctantly] The kid's family, they're suing me for everything, saying I knowingly put their son in danger, and my lawyer says if you testify that I didn't know—

Character 2 [en]: [laughing darkly] There it is, the real reason you're sitting in this shithole pretending to care about how I'm doing after three years of silence.

Character 1 [en]: It's not like that—okay, yes, I need your help, but I also needed to see you, to explain what really happened, to tell you I'm sorry for everything.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] You want me to save you by telling the truth about that night? Fine, but you're going to do something for me first—you're going to find that kid's mother and tell her the truth too.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned whisper] She'll destroy me if I admit I was involved at all, even unknowingly—my lawyers specifically said not to make any contact with her whatsoever. [nervous laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [gravely] Then I guess we both know what it feels like to be destroyed by the truth, don't we? At least yours is just money and reputation—mine's a life I can never give back.
