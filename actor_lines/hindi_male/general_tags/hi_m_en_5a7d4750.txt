Scenario: A steam fitter discovers his teenage son has been secretly apprenticing with a gunsmith after school, and confronts the gunsmith about teaching his child without permission.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: My son's been coming home with, [controlled anger], gun oil under his fingernails and now I find out he's been, [trembling], spending afternoons in your shop instead of at, [bitter], basketball practice like he's been telling me.

Character 2 [en]: [calm] The boy showed up three months ago asking about, [careful], apprenticeships and I told him to bring permission from his parents first. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Permission that he obviously never got because I would've remembered having a conversation about my fifteen-year-old, [disbelief], learning to build weapons.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] He brought me a signed form that looked, [hesitant], legitimate enough, and the kid has real talent with his hands, [softer], probably gets that from you considering the precision work you do with, [measured], steam systems.

Character 1 [en]: [sharp] Don't try to flatter me while we're discussing how you've been, [accusatory], teaching my child behind my back.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I understand you're upset but the truth is your son, [steady], has been learning valuable skills about mechanics, metallurgy, and, [earnest], craftsmanship that translate far beyond just, [thoughtful], firearms. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [quieter] The problem isn't the skills, it's the, [struggling], deception and the fact that you never thought to, [bitter], verify that signature or call me to, [defeated], confirm. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] You're absolutely right about that and I should've been more, [regretful], thorough, but once I started teaching him I saw how, [sincere], desperately he wanted to work with his hands like his, [gentle], father does.

Character 1 [en]: He could've learned that from me without the, [pained], guns involved, without learning how to create things that, [hollow], kill people, without going behind my, [breaking], back.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, he told me you're always, [careful], too busy with emergency calls and, umm, overtime shifts to actually teach him your, [sad], trade. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Um, he actually said that, I mean, he thinks I don't have, [hurt], time for him?

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Well, er, yeah, he mentioned that you work, [sympathetic], sixty-hour weeks sometimes, umm, keeping the city's infrastructure running. [quietly]

Character 1 [en]: [broken] Um, well, I guess.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Listen, um, what if we, [hopeful], worked out something where, well, he learns from both of us, I mean, properly this time with, [earnest], real permission?

Character 1 [en]: [weary] Well, um, maybe.

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] Your boy has the patience for detail work that's, [impressed], rare in kids his age, and whether it's fitting pipes or fitting barrels, precision is, [thoughtful], precision.

Character 1 [en]: [considering] He gets home at four-thirty every day acting like he's accomplished something, [softer], real, and I haven't seen him that engaged since his mother, [voice catching], left. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [compassionate] Kids need mentors who see their potential and sometimes that means, [understanding], multiple teachers showing them different paths to the same, [warm], values of craftsmanship and hard work. [softly]

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, maybe we could, [reluctant], work out a schedule or something, um, where I know exactly where he is and what he's learning.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] That's all I'm asking for, just a chance to, [sincere], keep teaching him the right way with your blessing and, [hopeful], involvement this time. [exhales]
