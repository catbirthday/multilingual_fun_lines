=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [awkward] So um, I know this is, [struggling], weird for both of us but, well, your mom named me in her will as, [heavy], your guardian and I mean, I haven't seen you since the funeral. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [hostile] Yeah well, you barely even, [bitter], knew her anymore so I don't know why she'd, um, pick someone who disappeared from our lives for, [cold], six years to suddenly be responsible for me.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, uh, I had my reasons for leaving town and, [regretful], your mom understood that even if, well, even if you don't right now.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Oh so you mean you two were, [sarcastic], secretly best friends while you were, um, gone living your perfect life and, well, never even called to check if we were, [trembling], still alive?

Character 1 [en]: Well, your mother and I stayed in touch through, [quietly], emails that you didn't know about because, um, she wanted to protect you from knowing how bad things really were.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] She never told me she was, [breaking], sick until it was too late. [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] I know, sweetheart.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Don't call me that.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Listen, I'm not trying to, [careful], replace your mom or pretend I'm suddenly your, [uncomfortable], parent but the fact is she trusted me with this and I'm not going to, [resolute], let her down even if you hate me for it.

Character 2 [en]: [challenging] Fine, then tell me why she, [demanding], picked you when she had actual family who could have, [accusatory], taken me in instead.

Character 1 [en]: Because your aunt is an alcoholic and your uncle, [harsh], lives in his car half the time.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, um, what do you mean Uncle Ray is, [confused], homeless because, well, Mom always said he had that job at the factory.

Character 1 [en]: [sympathetic] She protected you from a lot of, [sad], painful truths about your family.

Character 2 [en]: So everyone's been lying to me about, [hurt], everything my whole life apparently.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] Not lying exactly, just trying to let you be a, [careful], kid for as long as possible before the world got too, [weary], complicated. [pauses]

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Well, um, I guess being sixteen with a dead mom is, [shaky], pretty complicated already so, I mean, there's no point protecting me anymore.

Character 1 [en]: You're right and that's why I'm going to be, [honest], completely straight with you from now on even when it's, [determined], hard because you deserve the truth about, [fierce], everything including why I left and why I came back.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, okay then.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, your mom saved my life once when we were teenagers and, [emotional], I promised her that if anything happened, well, I'd make sure you were, [breaking], okay even if it meant upending my entire existence. [voice trembles]

Character 2 [en]: [soft] She saved your life and now you're supposed to, [uncertain], save mine or something?
