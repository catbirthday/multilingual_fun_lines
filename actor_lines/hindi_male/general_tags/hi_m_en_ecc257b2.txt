Scenario: A security guard at a halfway house discovers his new intake is his former cellmate from seven years ago, forcing them to confront their shared past and different paths.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Marcus, Jesus, is that really, [shaking], you standing there with that intake form or am I, [hollow], hallucinating from another sleepless night on these graveyard shifts?

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, I never thought I'd see you in a, [bitter], uniform Danny, especially not here at this, [defeated], halfway house where they send the ones who, um, you know, can't quite make it on the outside.

Character 1 [en]: [nostalgic] Seven years we spent in that, [trembling], eight-by-ten cell and now, well, um, here we are on opposite sides of another, [cracking], locked door. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] The parole board said this place would, [exhausted], help me transition but seeing you here makes it feel like I never, [whispering], left at all. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: You taught me how to, [careful], read in that cell, remember, using those torn pages from, [wistful], library books and now I'm the one holding, [shaking], the keys.

Character 2 [en]: [broken] I, um, well, I tried to stay clean out there, you know, but the world doesn't, [desperate], forgive men like us and every job interview ended when they, umm, ran my record.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] The night supervisor position opened up here because nobody else wanted to work with, [heavy], ex-cons.

Character 2 [en]: At least you found a way to, [sardonic], make peace with the bars even if you're standing on the, [resigned], other side now. [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [sincere] Listen, um, I mean, the rules say I can't show favoritism but, [protective], there's an empty bed in the corner room away from the, well, troublemakers if you want it. [voice drops]

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Remember when we used to play chess with, [nostalgic], pieces made from soap and you always let me win on, [breaking], Sundays because that's when my daughter never, [choked up], visited?

Character 1 [en]: [soft] I still have that soap knight you carved, [tender], tucked in my locker.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You kept it all these years even after, [confused], everything that happened, even after I got transferred for that, [ashamed], fight in the yard?

Character 1 [en]: [firm] We survived things in there that would, [haunted], break most people, and watching you walk through that door tonight reminds me that, [determined], some debts between men can't be, [resolute], paid with time served.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Maybe this time we can both, [struggling], learn how to live without walls, even if yours are, [understanding], invisible and mine are made of, [weary], glass. [exhales slowly]

Character 1 [en]: [earnest] I've got, um, four more hours on this shift and, well, there's coffee in the staff room that's, [gentle], actually drinkable if you want to, um, catch up properly.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] The truth is, um, I came here because, well, I knew you worked nights and I, umm, couldn't face starting over without seeing a, [tearful], familiar face.

Character 1 [en]: Every night I walk these halls checking, [hollow], locks and counting heads.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, I guess we're both still doing time, just in, [philosophical], different ways now, and maybe that's all men like us can, umm, hope for. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] No, we deserve more than, [fierce], survival Marcus, we deserve to actually, [passionate], live, and I'll be damned if I watch you, [breaking], give up now.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Then help me remember who I, [searching], was before the cage, before the numbers replaced my, [desperate], name, before I forgot what hope, [fading], tasted like. [voice cracks]
