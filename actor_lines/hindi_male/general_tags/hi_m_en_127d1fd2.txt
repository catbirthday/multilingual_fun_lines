=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So you're the general who wants me to portray your son at tomorrow's ceremony—I've been studying his photos and service records all week, trying to understand who he really was. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] You look nothing like him, but then again, nobody could. Marcus had this way of standing that made everyone else in the room seem smaller, not through intimidation but through sheer presence.

Character 1 [en]: [carefully] I've portrayed over three hundred fallen soldiers in the last five years, and each time their families tell me something similar—how their loved one filled spaces in ways that can't be replicated.

Character 2 [en]: Three hundred. [pause] That's a lot of ghosts to carry around in your body, walking in dead men's boots.

Character 1 [en]: [weary] Sometimes I forget which memories are mine and which belong to the families who hired me to bring their sons and daughters back for just one afternoon.

Character 2 [en]: [bluntly] I'm deploying again next month—advisory role, they call it, but we both know what that means in contested territories.

Character 1 [en]: You're planning another campaign while asking me to resurrect the son you lost in your last one—do you see the cruelty in that?

Character 2 [en]: [steadily] Every soldier I send into combat could be someone's Marcus, but if we don't secure those regions, the casualties will be in the thousands, not dozens. [clears throat]

Character 1 [en]: [quietly intense] When I wear your son's uniform tomorrow, speak with his cadence, and salute with his particular angle of the wrist, what do you actually want people to see?

Character 2 [en]: I want them to see that sacrifice means something, that these weren't just statistics in my tactical reports but real people who believed in what we're doing.

Character 1 [en]: Believed. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] Yes, past tense, because they're dead—but their beliefs don't have to die with them if we finish what they started.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I've heard this speech before, from parents who needed their child's death to mean something larger than a failed operation or a mistimed patrol.

Character 2 [en]: This isn't about meaning, it's about momentum—we're so close to stabilizing the entire region, and Marcus understood that. [voice breaking slightly]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] He was twenty-three, General. At that age, most of us understand duty and honor, but we don't really understand permanence.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] He understood enough to volunteer for the mission that killed him, knowing the risks, because he'd calculated them himself on the maps I taught him to read.

Character 1 [en]: [drained] Tomorrow, when I stand at that podium wearing his face, I'll honor his memory, but I won't glorify the war that took him. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] That's all I'm asking for—just let them see him one more time, standing tall, before I go create more young men for you to impersonate.

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] You know that's the most honest thing any client has ever said to me about what I do and why they need it.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Honesty's easy when you're planning battles you might not survive.
