=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] Master, um, I've been watching you these past weeks and, [voice breaking], कुछ हो रहा है आपको जो मैं, well, [desperate], समझ नहीं पा रहा हूँ लेकिन मुझे पता है कि यह उस भविष्यवाणी से जुड़ा है।

Character 2 [mix]: [gentle] You were always the most observant of my disciples, [measured], है ना, हालांकि मैंने कोशिश की, [weary], इस बोझ को तुम सबसे छुपाने की, [exhale], खासकर तुमसे। [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [mix]: [barely audible] Please don't leave us like this. कृपया हमें यूं छोड़कर मत जाइए।

Character 2 [mix]: The prophecy speaks of sacrifice and choices, [stern], लेकिन वो कभी नहीं बताते कि चुना हुआ व्यक्ति, [bitter], कुछ भी चुनने का अधिकार नहीं रखता, यहाँ तक कि, [hollow], यह कैसे समाप्त होगा वो भी नहीं। [long pause]

Character 1 [mix]: There has to be another way out of this, [frantic], क्योंकि मैंने अभिलेखागार में हर ग्रंथ पढ़ा है और कहीं भी, [determined], स्पष्ट रूप से नहीं लिखा है कि आपको मरना ही होगा। [voice cracks]

Character 2 [mix]: [resigned] My dear child, the words don't matter anymore, [heavy], जब जादू खुद ही मुझसे वो ले रहा है जिसकी उसे ज़रूरत है।

Character 1 [mix]: [pleading] But master, you taught me something important, um, [desperate], कि भविष्यवाणियाँ सिर्फ व्याख्याएं हैं और भाग्य को, well, [fierce], फिर से लिखा जा सकता है अगर हम कोशिश करने का साहस रखें, तो फिर, [shaking], आप इससे लड़ने की कोशिश क्यों नहीं कर रहे?

Character 2 [mix]: [soft] Because fighting this would mean something terrible, [thoughtful], यह बोझ किसी और को देना होगा, शायद तुम्हें भी, [pained], और यह वो कीमत है जो मैं कभी, [firm], किसी और को चुकाने नहीं दूंगा। [exhales]

Character 1 [mix]: [urgent] You don't get to make that choice for me, [angry], जब मैंने अपनी पूरी ज़िंदगी इस पल के लिए प्रशिक्षण लिया है, आपके साथ खड़े होने के लिए, [breaking], आपको मिटते हुए देखने के लिए नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [weakening] Listen to me very carefully now, um, [labored], क्योंकि ज्यादा समय नहीं बचा है और तुम्हें, well, [focused], समझना होगा कि तुम्हारी भूमिका कभी मुझे बचाने की नहीं थी बल्कि, er, [proud], वो काम आगे बढ़ाने की है जो मैं पूरा नहीं कर सकता।

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] Every lesson you taught me says one thing clearly, [furious], कि हार स्वीकार करना बिना हर विकल्प आज़माए सबसे बड़ी विफलता है।

Character 2 [mix]: [tender] Sometimes, my stubborn apprentice, the greatest victory comes from understanding, um, [wise], कि कब छोड़ना है और भरोसा करना है कि जो तुमने बनाया है वो, like, [peaceful], तुम्हारे बिना भी खड़ा रहेगा, और तुम, well, [loving], तुम वो हो जो मैंने बनाया है।

Character 1 [mix]: You speak of trust but you won't even try, [accusatory], मुझ पर इतना भरोसा नहीं करते कि मैं कोई और रास्ता खोजने में मदद कर सकूं।

Character 2 [mix]: [firm] Because I've already seen what happens when we try, um, [haunted], जब हम भाग्य को धोखा देने की कोशिश करते हैं, और कीमत, well, हमेशा कोई निर्दोष चुकाता है।

Character 1 [mix]: [defiant] Then let me be the one who pays the price, well, मैं यह चुन रहा हूं पूरी समझ के साथ, [resolute], कि इसका क्या मतलब है।

Character 2 [mix]: You think you understand sacrifice completely, [sad], लेकिन तुम अभी भी इतने युवा हो और आग से भरे हो जो जलती है बिना जाने कि वो क्या भस्म कर रही है।

Character 1 [mix]: [quiet] Maybe that fire is exactly what's needed right now, [determined], जो सब मानते हैं कि अपरिवर्तनीय है उसे बदलने के लिए, इस चक्र को तोड़ने के लिए जिसने, [fierce], आपसे पहले इतने चुने हुए लोगों को ले लिया। [whispers]

Character 2 [mix]: [contemplative] You sound exactly like I did once upon a time, [regretful], इससे पहले कि मैंने सीखा कि कुछ कीमतें स्मृति से भी पुरानी पत्थरों में तय हैं।

Character 1 [mix]: [steady] Then teach me one last lesson about survival, [broken], कि कैसे आगे बढ़ूं जब मेरी हर आस्था अंधकार में स्वेच्छा से चली जाए।

Character 2 [mix]: [loving] The lesson is this simple truth, [peaceful], जो तुम्हें अंधकार लग रहा है वो बस एक रोशनी के खत्म होने और, [hopeful], तुम्हारे माध्यम से दूसरी की शुरुआत के बीच का स्थान है।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [trembling] Master, um, I've been watching you these past weeks and, [voice breaking], something is happening to you that I, well, [desperate], I don't understand but I know it's connected to the prophecy.

Character 2: [gentle] You were always, [measured], the most observant of my disciples, weren't you, though I tried, [weary], so hard to hide this burden from all of you, [exhale], especially from you. [sighs deeply]

Character 1: [barely audible] Please don't leave.

Character 2: The prophecy speaks of sacrifice, [stern], but what they never tell you is that the chosen one, [bitter], doesn't get to choose anything at all, not even, [hollow], how it ends. [long pause]

Character 1: There has to be, [frantic], another way because I've read every text in the archives and nowhere, [determined], does it explicitly say you have to die. [voice cracks]

Character 2: [resigned] My dear child, the words don't matter when the magic itself, [heavy], is already taking what it needs from me.

Character 1: [pleading] But master, um, I mean, you taught me that prophecies are, [desperate], interpretations and that fate can be, well, [fierce], rewritten if we're brave enough to try, so like, [shaking], why won't you fight this?

Character 2: [soft] Because fighting this, [thoughtful], would mean passing this burden to someone else, perhaps even, [pained], to you, and that is a price I will never, [firm], allow anyone else to pay. [exhales]

Character 1: [urgent] You don't get to make that choice for me when I've trained, [angry], my entire life for this moment, to stand beside you, [breaking], not to watch you fade away.

Character 2: [weakening] Listen to me, um, really listen now because, [labored], there isn't much time left and you need to, well, [focused], understand that your role was never to save me but to, er, [proud], continue what I cannot finish.

Character 1: [desperate] Every lesson you taught me says that accepting defeat, [furious], without exhausting every option is the ultimate failure.

Character 2: [tender] Sometimes, my stubborn apprentice, the greatest victory is, um, [wise], knowing when to let go and trust that what you've built will, like, [peaceful], stand without you, and you, well, [loving], you are what I've built.

Character 1: You speak of trust but you won't, [accusatory], trust me enough to help you find another way.

Character 2: [firm] Because, um, I've already seen what happens when we try to cheat fate, and the cost, well, [haunted], it's always someone innocent who pays.

Character 1: [defiant] Then, well, I mean, let me be the one who pays because I'm choosing this with, [resolute], full knowledge of what it means.

Character 2: You think you understand sacrifice but you're, [sad], still so young and full of fire that burns without knowing what it consumes.

Character 1: [quiet] Maybe that fire is exactly what's needed to change, [determined], what everyone believes is unchangeable, to break this cycle that's taken, [fierce], so many chosen ones before you. [whispers]

Character 2: [contemplative] You sound like I did once, before I learned that some prices, [regretful], are set in stone older than memory itself.

Character 1: [steady] Then teach me one last lesson about how to carry on when everything I've believed in, [broken], walks willingly into darkness.

Character 2: [loving] The lesson is this: what feels like darkness to you, [peaceful], is simply the space between one light ending and, [hopeful], another beginning through you.
