=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Marcus, is that, um, really you standing there in that, [disbelief], expensive suit looking like you own the world, I mean, after all these years?

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Oh my God, Tommy, I, well, I can't believe it's, [breaking], actually you after twelve years of wondering what happened, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] I've been right here in the city, [bitter], watching you from a distance sometimes when you'd walk past, never, [quiet], recognizing the guy who used to be your best friend.

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] I looked for you, I mean, after you disappeared from school I, [desperate], searched everywhere but your family moved and nobody would, [cracking], tell me where you went, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, um, things got complicated after Dad died and, [heavy], Mom couldn't keep it together, so I, well, [trailing off], ended up taking care of myself since I was sixteen, you know.

Character 2 [en]: Tommy, I'm celebrating my, [excited], promotion tonight but seeing you here makes everything feel so, [conflicted], empty and meaningless because we were supposed to, [nostalgic], conquer the world together. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [wistful] Yeah, well, we were going to be, um, business partners by thirty, remember, [laughing sadly], millionaires by forty with matching Ferraris and, I mean, [quiet], beach houses next door to each other. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Listen, forget the party because I'm, [urgent], taking you somewhere warm where we can actually, [caring], talk and figure out how to get you back on your, [hopeful], feet again.

Character 1 [en]: [resistant] Marcus, um, I don't need your, [proud], charity or pity just because you, well, [firm], made it big and I'm sleeping behind the, you know, [quieter], dumpsters near Fifth Street.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] This isn't charity, um, this is me refusing to, [emotional], walk away from my brother again, I mean, after twelve years of regret.

Character 1 [en]: You have no idea what, um, [pained], I've been through or who I've, well, [ashamed], become just to survive out here, you know. [voice breaks]

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Then help me understand because the Tommy I, [earnest], knew was the strongest person who taught me how to, [warm], never give up.

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] That Tommy died somewhere between the third shelter closing and, um, [broken], the first winter sleeping outside when I realized, well, [hollow], nobody was coming to save me, you know. [crying softly]

Character 2 [en]: [choked up] Well, um, I'm here now. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] The party people inside are probably, [bitter], wondering where their golden boy went, missing you buying, [sarcastic], rounds and telling your success stories while I'm just another, [defeated], invisible person they step around.

Character 2 [en]: Those people don't even, [dismissive], know my real name or that I grew up poor too.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You still carry that old photo of us from, [emotional], eighth grade graduation in your wallet even though you're living this, [gesturing], whole different life now where people like me, [quiet], don't exist.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Tommy, I mean, I've carried that photo through, [passionate], every single day hoping somehow I'd find you again, well, and here we are. [voice shaking]

Character 1 [en]: Here we are. [whispers]

Character 2 [en]: Come inside with me right now and let's, [inviting], show everyone that real friendship survives anything, even, [confident], twelve years of silence and pain. [extends hand]
