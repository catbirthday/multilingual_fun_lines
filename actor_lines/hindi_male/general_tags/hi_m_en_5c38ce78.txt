=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [imperious] So, um, you've been my kingdom's, [dismissive], chief historian for what, twenty years now, and yet you still, [irritated], insist on recording these tedious truths about, well, my predecessor's accomplishments?

Character 2 [en]: [steady] Your Majesty, I mean, the historical records have been, [careful], maintained according to the sacred protocols established, um, four centuries ago when this kingdom was, [reverent], founded on principles of accurate documentation.

Character 1 [en]: [laughing coldly] Sacred protocols, well, how quaint that you think, [mocking], pieces of parchment written by dead men should, I mean, govern what my subjects learn about their, [commanding], rightful ruler's glorious achievements. [scoffs]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Those protocols, um, have preserved the truth of our kingdom's history through, [firm], thirteen different dynasties, ensuring that, well, future generations understand where they came from.

Character 1 [en]: [arrogant] Truth is whatever I, [amused], declare it to be, and right now, um, I'm declaring that the records need to reflect how I, [grandiose], single-handedly saved this kingdom from the chaos my weak father, [venomous], left behind. [waves hand dismissively]

Character 2 [en]: [troubled] But Your Majesty, um, the archives clearly show that the economic recovery began, [hesitant], under your father's reforms and the military victories were, well, won by General Marcus who you've since, [carefully], exiled.

Character 1 [en]: [dangerous] General Marcus was a traitor who, [cold], plotted against me, or have you forgotten that, um, convenient truth already?

Character 2 [en]: [measured] I remember him receiving the highest military honors before his, [pained], sudden arrest on charges that were never publicly, [bitter], proven in any court.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Um, how dare you?

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] The records show that your reign began with, [somber], seventeen executions of former advisors, the dissolution of the council, and the, [heavy], burning of half the royal library. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [silky] Those books contained, [dismissive], dangerous ideas that poisoned minds against progress, um, much like the ideas you seem to harbor, old man.

Character 2 [en]: [defiant] History will remember.

Character 1 [en]: Not if you're dead. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [calm] Then another historian will take my place, because the, [determined], truth has a way of surviving tyrants who think they can, [prophetic], rewrite reality to suit their vanity and eventually, [knowing], crumble into the very dust they tried to shape.

Character 1 [en]: [contemptuous] Perhaps, but um, I wonder if your precious protocols say anything about, [cruel], what happens to historians who refuse their king's direct commands, well, especially when their families live so, I mean, vulnerably in the capital?

Character 2 [en]: [shaking] My daughter serves in your court as a, [breaking], scribe, my son trains with your guard, and my wife tends the royal, [defeated], gardens that your mother once loved. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: [satisfied] Ah, there it is.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Three days, Your Majesty.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Three days for what, I mean, to rewrite four centuries of history according to my, [amused], specifications, or to say goodbye to your family before you choose your, [dark], principles over their lives? [chuckles darkly]

Character 2 [en]: [broken] Three days to teach my apprentice where I've hidden the, [desperate], true records before I give you the forgeries you, [resigned], demand. [exhales slowly]
