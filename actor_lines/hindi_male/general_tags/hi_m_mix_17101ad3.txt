Scenario: A stunt performer visits a boot fitter after a career-threatening ankle injury, struggling with both physical limitations and the emotional weight of potentially losing their identity.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: तो, अम्म, मैंने अभी तक किसी को ये नहीं बताया है, लेकिन डॉक्टर्स कह रहे हैं कि मुझे शायद कभी, मतलब, शायद कभी भी full range of motion वापस नहीं मिलेगी left ankle में, which is basically a death sentence for what I do—या करता था, I suppose.

Character 2 [mix]: [warmly] वैसे तो फिर आप बिल्कुल सही जगह आए हैं, सच कहूं तो, क्योंकि मैंने dancers के लिए, athletes के लिए, हर तरह की injuries वाले लोगों के लिए boots fit किए हैं, और, अम्म, the right support can make a world of difference to what your body thinks it can't do anymore.

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] शायद।

Character 2 [mix]: मैं ज़रा, अ, मैं ज़रा महसूस करूं कहाँ scar tissue है—अरे वाह, ये तो काफी extensive है, but I've actually seen worse heal beautifully with proper support and time, पता है ना?

Character 1 [mix]: तीन surgeries, चार महीने physio की, और मैं अभी भी नहीं कर पाता, जैसे, मैं अपनी toes पर कुछ seconds से ज्यादा खड़ा भी नहीं हो सकता without it feeling like something's tearing.

Character 2 [mix]: हम्म, वो खिंचाव वाली feeling, वो शायद adhesions हैं, actual tearing नहीं, और, अ, सही heel lift और ankle stabilization के साथ, we might be able to redistribute that pressure completely differently.

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitant] बात ये है कि मुझे 12 feet की ऊंचाई से land करना पड़ता है, falls में roll करना पड़ता है, एकदम से pivot करना—it's not just walking I'm worried about here.

Character 2 [mix]: ओह, बिल्कुल, मेरा मतलब, मैंने पिछले साल एक parkour athlete के लिए boots fit किए थे जिसने अपनी heel bone बिल्कुल तोड़ दी थी, और वो अब वापस, अम्म, well she's actually competing again now, यकीन कर सकते हैं?

Character 1 [mix]: [skeptical exhale] ये उन miracle stories में से एक लगती है जो लोग सुनाते हैं when they're trying to be encouraging. [sighs]

Character 2 [mix]: [gently] अरे, मैं समझता हूं, सच में समझता हूं—उम्मीद करना, अ, it's scary when you've already been disappointed so many times, लेकिन चलिए पहले आपको comfortable करने पर focus करते हैं, ठीक है?

Character 1 [mix]: [softer] Accident को सात महीने हो गए हैं और मैं एक बार भी, अम्म, मैं set पर एक बार भी नहीं गया, not even to visit, क्योंकि बाकी सबको काम करते देखना would just be too much.

Character 2 [mix]: [carefully] पता है क्या? चलिए कुछ try करते हैं—मेरे लिए खड़े हो जाइए और बस, अ, अपना वज़न धीरे-धीरे एक पैर से दूसरे पर shift कीजिए while I watch how your ankle responds.

Character 1 [mix]: ठीक है, लेकिन—आह, देखिए? [frustrated] बिल्कुल यहीं, यहीं अटकता है हर बार, like there's broken glass under the skin या कुछ।

Character 2 [mix]: [thoughtfully] दिलचस्प, ये actually आपका शरीर खुद को बचा रहा है from a movement it thinks is dangerous, लेकिन सही support structure के साथ, we can basically retrain that response. [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter laugh] मेरा पूरा career ही इस बारे में था कि शरीर जिसे dangerous समझता है उससे आगे जाना, और अब मैं अपने ही पैर को convince नहीं कर पाता कि मुझ पर भरोसा करे।

Character 2 [mix]: भरोसा वापस बनने में वक़्त लगता है, especially with yourself, और, अम्म, जो measurements मैं ले रहा हूं वो actually ज्यादा flexibility दिखा रहे हैं than you probably realize you have. [encouraging]

Character 1 [mix]: सच में?

Character 2 [mix]: [brightening] ओह बिल्कुल—आपके पास लगभग 70 percent range है compared to your right foot, जो कि, honestly, जिस injury के बारे में आपने बताया उसके हिसाब से remarkable है, और proper boots के साथ, we can probably compensate for the rest.

Character 1 [mix]: [voice cracking slightly] मैं बस फिर से काम करना चाहता हूं, पता है? Even if it's just simple falls, basic wire work, मुझे फ़र्क नहीं पड़ता—मुझे बस फिर से खुद जैसा महसूस करना है। [shaky exhale]

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly kind] तो फिर बिल्कुल यही करेंगे, one perfectly fitted boot at a time, और मैं यहाँ रहूंगा adjust करने के लिए जैसे-जैसे आप heal करते जाएंगे, because you will keep healing, मैं आपसे वादा करता हूं।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: So, um, I haven't actually told anyone this yet, but the doctors say I might not, er, might not ever get full range of motion back in my left ankle, which is basically a death sentence for what I do—or did, I suppose.

Character 2: [warmly] Well, you're in the right place then, honestly, because I've fitted boots for dancers, athletes, folks with all kinds of injuries, and, mm, the right support can make a world of difference to what your body thinks it can't do anymore.

Character 1: [quietly] Maybe.

Character 2: Let me just, uh, let me feel where the scar tissue is—oh wow, that's quite extensive, but I've actually seen worse heal beautifully with proper support and time, you know?

Character 1: Three surgeries, four months of physio, and I still can't, like, I can't even stand on my toes for more than a few seconds without it feeling like something's tearing.

Character 2: Mmm, that pulling sensation, that's probably adhesions, not actual tearing, and, er, with the right heel lift and ankle stabilization, we might be able to redistribute that pressure completely differently.

Character 1: [hesitant] The thing is, I need to be able to land from twelve feet up, roll through falls, pivot on a dime—it's not just walking I'm worried about here.

Character 2: Oh, absolutely, I mean, I fitted boots for a parkour athlete last year who'd shattered her heel bone, and she's back to, um, well she's actually competing again now, if you can believe it.

Character 1: [skeptical exhale] That sounds like one of those miracle stories people tell you when they're trying to be encouraging. [sighs]

Character 2: [gently] Hey, I get it, I really do—hope is, uh, it's scary when you've already been disappointed so many times, but let's just focus on getting you comfortable first, okay?

Character 1: [softer] It's been seven months since the accident and I haven't, um, I haven't been on set once, not even to visit, because seeing everyone else working would just be too much.

Character 2: [carefully] You know what? Let's try something—stand up for me and just, er, shift your weight slowly from foot to foot while I watch how your ankle responds.

Character 1: Okay, but—ahh, see? [frustrated] Right there, that's where it catches every single time, like there's broken glass under the skin or something.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Interesting, that's actually your body protecting itself from a movement it thinks is dangerous, but with the right support structure, we can basically retrain that response. [pause]

Character 1: [bitter laugh] My whole career was about pushing past what bodies think is dangerous, and now I can't even convince my own foot to trust me.

Character 2: Trust takes time to rebuild, especially with yourself, and, mm, these measurements I'm getting actually show more flexibility than you probably realize you have. [encouraging]

Character 1: Really?

Character 2: [brightening] Oh absolutely—you've got nearly seventy percent range compared to your right foot, which, honestly, for the injury you described is remarkable, and with proper boots, we can probably compensate for the rest.

Character 1: [voice cracking slightly] I just want to work again, you know? Even if it's just simple falls, basic wire work, I don't care—I just need to feel like myself again. [shaky exhale]

Character 2: [firmly kind] Then that's exactly what we're going to work toward, one perfectly fitted boot at a time, and I'll be here to adjust them as you heal, because you will keep healing, I promise you that.
