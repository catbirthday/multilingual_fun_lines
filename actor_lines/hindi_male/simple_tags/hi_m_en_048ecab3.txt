=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So, um, I keep trying to reconcile the person who, [hesitantly], used to rescue injured birds with me as kids with someone who now, [confused], runs a place like this, you know, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [diplomatic] The world isn't as simple as when we were twelve and, [patiently], thought we could save every creature we found, though I understand why, [warm], you might see this as betrayal.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Well, um, maybe it is.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] You know, er, I employ forty people who, [frustrated], need these jobs to feed their families, and um, that matters too, I mean. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Right, um, of course.

Character 2 [en]: [opening-up] Look, uh, every morning when I walk through those doors, [conflicted], I remember that summer we nursed that hawk back to health, and well, [shaky voice], it tears at something inside me that I can't, er, explain to anyone else. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You still think about that hawk we named Phoenix, [cherishing], after all these years of doing what you do here, [empathetically], even though it must hurt? [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Phoenix taught me that sometimes, [regretful], mercy comes in forms we don't expect or want to acknowledge, and, [very quietly], maybe that's what I tell myself to sleep at night.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Maybe I came here expecting, [angry], to find a monster instead of my oldest friend still fighting their own conscience.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] God, you know, I mean, nobody else would understand why I keep that photo of us with Phoenix, [emotionally], in my desk drawer here of all places, um. [crying while speaking]

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, maybe that photo is your reminder that, [tenderly], you were someone else once, er, before life got complicated, you know. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, some days I sit at this desk and wonder if that kid would, [disappointed], recognize who I've become, or if they'd, [whispered], understand the compromises I've made to survive in this world, I mean. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: That kid would probably be confused by both of us, [sad], by how we've learned to live with contradictions that once seemed, [passionate], impossible to accept. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Well, you know, I have to make a choice every day between, [determined], being the person I thought I'd become and, [steadily], being the person my family needs me to be, um. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, er, I guess we all make those choices, [melancholic], just in different ways that sometimes, [authentic], put us on opposite sides of things we once believed together, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] But you still came here to see me, [grateful], despite everything this place represents to you, and, [hopeful], that has to mean our friendship survived somehow. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Of course it survived because real connection, [fierce], transcends the roles we play, even when those roles, [very sincerely], seem irreconcilable. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Thank you for that.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtful] You know, um, maybe the real tragedy isn't what we've become but, [gently], how we've learned to forgive ourselves for it, and well, [peacefully], forgive each other too, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] After all these years of feeling alone with this weight, [relieved], hearing you say that makes me believe that maybe, [tearfully], the kid with the injured hawk is still in here somewhere, [voice breaking], waiting to be remembered.
