=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I found the prescription bottles in your bathroom trash when I was, um, cleaning up after dinner. Three different medications, all from different doctors, and you never mentioned any of this to me.

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] You were going through my trash? [pause] That's exactly why I don't tell you things anymore, Mom. I'm thirty-two years old, I can manage my own health decisions.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Managing? Is that what you call it when you're, uh, when you're taking anxiety medication with sleeping pills and something I can't even pronounce? [sighs] How long has this been going on?

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Since the promotion, maybe six months before that. Look, everyone at the firm is on something, it's just how we, um, how we get through the hundred-hour weeks.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Hundred-hour weeks? You told me you were doing better with work-life balance, that you were, I mean, you said you were taking weekends off now.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah well, taking weekends off doesn't exactly get you partner track, does it? [exhales] I've been sleeping in the office most nights anyway, so technically I wasn't lying about being home less.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Your father worked himself into an early grave trying to provide for this family, and now you're, er, you're walking the exact same path. [trembling] I can't watch this happen again.

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] Dad had a heart condition. I'm just tired. There's a difference.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Tired? Sweetheart, you've lost probably twenty pounds since Christmas, your hands shake when you think no one's looking, and you, um, you called me crying at three AM last week but pretended it was a wrong number. That's not just tired.

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] I didn't think you'd recognized my voice.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Always, baby. Always.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] The thing is, I've built this whole life that looks perfect from the outside, right? Corner office, six-figure bonus, everyone thinks I've got it together, but I, uh, I can't even sleep without medication anymore. [voice breaking] Sometimes I sit in that office at two AM and wonder how I became this person.

Character 1 [en]: You became someone who thought they had to carry everything alone. [gently] But you don't, you never did.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I wanted to make you proud, to show you that all your sacrifices meant something. [sniffles] After Dad died, you worked three jobs to keep me in that private school, and I thought if I could just, um, if I could succeed enough, it would somehow make it worth it.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Oh honey, you were worth it the moment you were born. Not because of what you'd achieve or who you'd become, but simply because you existed. [pause] Success was never the price of my love.

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] I don't know how to stop.

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Then we'll figure it out together. First thing tomorrow, we're calling Dr. Patel, the one who helped after your dad passed. And you're taking a real break, not just a weekend but actual time to, er, to remember who you are underneath all this pressure.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The partners will never approve a leave. They'll say I'm weak, that I can't handle the stress, and then everything I've worked for just, um, disappears.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Then let it disappear. [empathetically] Your life is worth more than any job, any promotion, any amount of money. I'd rather have you alive and happy doing literally anything else than lose you to this.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Mom, I'm scared. [long pause] I'm scared that if I stop now, if I admit I can't do this, then I'll never be able to start again. Like maybe this exhausting, hollow version of me is all I know how to be anymore.
