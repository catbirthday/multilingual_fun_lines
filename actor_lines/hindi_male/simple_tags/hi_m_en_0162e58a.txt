=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confused] I wasn't expecting to find anyone here at three AM, especially not, [exhausted], you sleeping on the break room couch with all your stuff in, [quietly], bags around you like some kind of makeshift bedroom setup.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, um, I can explain this whole situation, I mean, it's not what you, [embarrassed], probably think it is, and well, I was going to find a better solution but, [shaky voice], things have been really complicated lately. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I'm not judging or anything, I mean, we've worked together for, [concerned], four years and clearly something serious is, [softly], happening if you're living in our break room instead of, you know, going home.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] My landlord decided to sell the building to developers who are, [frustrated], turning everything into luxury condos that cost three times what I was paying.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Jesus, um, how long have you been, like, sleeping here, because I mean, [worried], the night security does rounds and if management finds out they'll, [trailing off], definitely fire you for this kind of thing...

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Um, about three weeks now, and, well, I've been careful to pack everything up before the, [anxious], day shift arrives and nobody's noticed because, you know, I still shower at the gym down the street.

Character 1 [en]: The plastic molds we run all night generate enough, [tired], heat to keep this place warm but that can't be good for your health.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, it's better than sleeping in my car during winter, and, [grimly], at least here I have access to a microwave and running water.

Character 1 [en]: [sympathetic] Look, um, my brother just moved out of my spare room, so, well, I have space if you need somewhere, [gently], temporary while you figure things out.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You'd seriously offer that to someone who's been, [emotionally], secretly squatting in the workplace like some kind of, [laughing nervously], industrial vagrant?

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, you're not some stranger, you're the person who, [firmly], covered my shifts when my dad was dying and never once, um, asked for anything in return.

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] That's different though, that was just being a decent, [trembling], coworker and friend. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [kindly] Maybe this is my chance to be decent too, because watching you, [concerned], try to maintain dignity while literally homeless at work is, [slowly], breaking my heart.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] God, I've been so scared someone would find out and, [ashamed], report me to HR, but instead you're offering to, [gratefully], actually help me get back on my feet.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] The blow molding machines will still be here tomorrow, but you need a real, [sincerely], bed and a door you can lock tonight.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I don't even know what to say except that working these, [wearily], overnight shifts has been the only stable thing while everything else, [voice breaking], fell apart around me.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, um, pack up your stuff because, I mean, we're leaving early and you're coming home with me before the, [firmly], morning crew shows up. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Um, I've been so tired of pretending everything's fine, and, well, carrying this secret alone has been, [heavily], exhausting beyond anything the actual work ever was, you know, [emotionally], more than these twelve-hour shifts could ever be.

Character 1 [en]: [reassuringly] Hey, um, everyone needs help sometimes, and I mean, you've been standing next to me at these machines long enough for me to know you'd, [warmly], do the same for me.

Character 2 [en]: [hopefully] Maybe when this is all over we can laugh about the time I turned the break room into, [shakily], a studio apartment, but right now I just feel, [overwhelmed], grateful that you found me instead of someone else who might not, [quietly], understand what desperation looks like.
