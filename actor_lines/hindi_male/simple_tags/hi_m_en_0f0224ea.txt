=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] This diary has seen better days, the binding is, [concerned], completely shot and the pages are so fragile they're, [carefully], practically disintegrating, but with proper treatment I can, [hopeful], stabilize it for you. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [depressed] My mother wrote in this thing every single night for thirty years until the, [bitter], cancer took her voice away.

Character 1 [en]: [perceptive] The water damage here suggests it was stored somewhere with high humidity, probably a basement or, [trailing off], attic maybe...

Character 2 [en]: Um, yeah, well, I mean, after she died I just threw it in a box with everything else I couldn't, [shaky voice], deal with.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] These ink smudges aren't from water though, they're from tears, [observant], recent ones by the look of the salt patterns, and the pages here are, [hesitantly], worn from being read over and over.

Character 2 [en]: I, umm, started reading it last month, you know, and discovered she wrote about how disappointed she was in, [exhausted], me. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Parents write their fears in diaries, not their truths, and I've restored enough journals to know that, [empathetically], disappointment is usually just love wrapped in, [sad], worry about things they couldn't control. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] Sometimes I wonder.

Character 1 [en]: The entries you've bookmarked with these torn pieces of newspaper are all from, [curious], 1994 through 1996, which based on your age would have been your, [thoughtful], teenage years when everything feels like the end of the, [melancholic], world. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Those were the years I dropped out of college, got arrested twice, and basically confirmed every, [frustrated], terrible thing she thought about my generation being slackers with no, [angry], ambition or direction in life.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Well, um, I mean, you're here now paying good money to preserve her words, so maybe, [kindly], that says something about who you became.

Character 2 [en]: You know, umm, the irony is that, well, she died before I could tell her I finally got my life together, er, started my own business and, [regretful], everything she wanted for me.

Character 1 [en]: [passionate] Look at this entry from 1999 where she pressed this flower between the pages, writing about how proud she was when you, [excited], called her that Christmas, how she knew you'd find your way because you always, [very sincerely], had her stubborn streak. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: Umm, I never, well, I didn't get that far in reading yet because, [trembling], the earlier stuff hurt too much.

Character 1 [en]: Most people want me to restore books to their, [nostalgic], original state, but sometimes the damage tells a story that's worth, [contemplative], preserving too.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] So, um, like, you know, maybe we could keep some of those tear stains and, well, the worn pages as they are, I mean, evidence that someone, [hopefully], cared enough to read them. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] That's exactly right.

Character 2 [en]: She wrote in the margins sometimes about, [animatedly], wanting to talk to me but not knowing how to bridge the gap between her Depression-era childhood and my, [bittersweet], MTV generation cynicism.

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Well, um, I can preserve both the original text and her margin notes, er, create a conservation treatment that, [professionally], honors the complete narrative, you know, including the parts where you both struggled to, [softly], understand each other. [deep pitch]

Character 2 [en]: Maybe that's, um, what I really need, well, not just her story but, [tearfully], our story preserved together somehow. [sniffle]
