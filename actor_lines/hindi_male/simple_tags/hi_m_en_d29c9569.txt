Scenario: A devil appears in the office of a veteran senator who's about to vote on a crucial healthcare bill, offering to guarantee its passage in exchange for a seemingly minor favor.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, um, Senator Mitchell, I've been watching your, [amused], healthcare bill struggle through committees for, er, months now, and I mean, you seem rather stuck.

Character 2 [en]: Who are you and how did you, [suspicious], get past security into my private office at, um, I mean, three in the morning when the building should be, [stern], completely locked down?

Character 1 [en]: [playful] Security measures are more of a, [chuckle], suggestion for someone like me, though I appreciate the, [confidently], theatrical midnight setting your government buildings provide with all these, [whispering], shadows and mahogany.

Character 2 [en]: [sharp] I'm calling security right now unless you, [frustrated], explain exactly what you want and how you, [loudly], know about my bill.

Character 1 [en]: Your bill needs seventeen more votes to pass and you've been, [slowly], losing sleep calculating which colleagues might flip if you offer the right compromises.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Look, um, whatever lobbyist group or, er, foreign interest you represent, I mean, I don't take meetings like this, especially not with someone who, [trembling], breaks into federal buildings.

Character 1 [en]: [counseling] I represent interests far older than any government, Senator, and I can, [gently], guarantee your bill passes next week intact. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: Nobody can guarantee that, um, not even the President, and, well, I've been in politics long enough to know that, [bitter], promises like yours come with, I mean, prices I can't afford to pay.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Seventeen votes.

Character 2 [en]: What exactly would you, [hesitantly], want in return for this impossible guarantee, assuming you could even, [nervous], deliver on such an absurd claim, which you, [sarcastic], obviously cannot?

Character 1 [en]: [formal] All I need is for you to, [empathetically], vote 'no' on a small agricultural subsidy amendment next month that, [curious], nobody will even remember existed.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Agricultural subsidies affect thousands of farmers in my state so there's nothing, [angry], small about them, and besides, you still haven't explained who or, [shaky voice], what you actually are. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: You already know, um, what I am, Senator Mitchell, because, er, deep down you've always suspected that, [whispering loudly], entities like me exist when deals seem too perfect and, well, circumstances align too conveniently.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] So, um, you're telling me that, er, I mean, you're actually suggesting that you're some kind of, [exhausted], supernatural entity here to make a deal?

Character 1 [en]: [excited] Um, I prefer 'alternative negotiator' but yes, I mean, I'm offering you everything you've, [passionately], worked twenty years to achieve, er, universal healthcare for your constituents.

Character 2 [en]: Even if I believed this insanity, which I, [firmly], don't, accepting help from something like you would, [horrified], corrupt everything good that bill represents and turn it into a, [very sad], mockery of public service. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] The forty-three thousand people who'll die without coverage this year won't care, [melancholic], about the metaphysical origins of their salvation, only that someone finally, [soft-spoken], fought hard enough to save them. [clearing throat]

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] That's exactly the kind of, [manipulative], logic that makes these deals so dangerous.

Character 1 [en]: [reassuring] Senator, the amendment I mentioned affects, [matter-of-factly], GMO labeling requirements for exported corn, nothing that touches human lives directly.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, if this is real, and I mean, I still don't believe it is but, er, if you're truly offering this, then I need to, [thoughtfully], know what happens to that agricultural amendment and, well, why it matters to you so much.
