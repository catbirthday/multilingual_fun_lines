Scenario: A ghoul seeks help from a pharmacovigilance specialist after discovering that contaminated pharmaceutical waste has been poisoning the corpses it feeds on, causing severe illness to its kind.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [somber] Um, I need to speak with you about something that's, [quietly], been affecting my kind for months now, though, well, I realize this conversation may be difficult for you to understand.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Um, your kind?

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, I feed on the deceased, and lately, er, something in the bodies has been, [shaky voice], making us violently ill, something that, [whispering], tastes chemical and wrong. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You're telling me you consume human, [slowly], remains and you've come to me for medical advice about contamination?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] I mean, we've existed alongside your kind for centuries without incident, um, but now the bodies from certain morgues are, [anxious], poisoned with something that burns through our systems like, [frustrated], acid.

Character 2 [en]: [calculated] The morgues you mentioned are all, [stern], near pharmaceutical disposal sites where we've documented improper waste management causing, [worried], groundwater contamination that could theoretically accumulate in, [trailing off], human tissue...

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, three of my bloodline have already died from, [crying while speaking], consuming these tainted corpses, and I mean, we don't know how to, [desperately], stop it because we don't understand your chemicals or, [loudly], why they're suddenly everywhere!

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Look, umm, I monitor drug safety for living patients, but, [nervous], what you're describing sounds like accumulated pharmaceutical metabolites that weren't properly filtered.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] So, er, your industry poisoned the dead without even, [bitterly], knowing creatures like us exist, without considering that, [exhausted], death isn't the end of the body's purpose for, well, everyone? [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I had no idea anything, [very quietly], fed on human remains in modern times, but if what you're saying is true then, [regretful], we've inadvertently created a toxic chain that's, [monotone], killing an entire species.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Umm, can you help us identify which bodies are safe, or, [pleading], at least tell us which chemicals to avoid, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] The contamination patterns follow specific drug disposal sites where, [carefully], certain antipsychotics and chemotherapy agents were illegally dumped, creating, [whispering loudly], bioaccumulation in surrounding cemetery grounds.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Then there's a pattern we can follow to avoid the, [hopeful], poisoned feeding grounds and perhaps find areas that remain untainted.

Character 2 [en]: I can provide you with contamination maps showing, [reluctant], pharmaceutical waste sites, though sharing this data with a, [uncomfortable], ghoul wasn't exactly covered in my ethics training.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Your discomfort is understandable, but consider that we're, [sincerely], an indicator species for a contamination problem that will eventually affect the living too.

Character 2 [en]: [serious] The groundwater contamination spreading from these sites is already showing, [alarmed], elevated pharmaceutical levels in nearby wells, which means this problem extends beyond just your, [pause], unusual dietary needs.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Then perhaps our survival instincts can serve as an early, [grimly], warning system for dangers your monitoring systems haven't detected yet.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Well, how many?

Character 1 [en]: [sad] Seventeen of us remain in this city, down from, [very melancholic], forty-three just six months ago.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] I'll compile the data tonight, and um, meet you tomorrow at the old cemetery gate, er, where we can review which areas are safe and, [warm], maybe prevent more deaths—both for your kind and, [very sincerely], eventually for mine. [deep breath]
