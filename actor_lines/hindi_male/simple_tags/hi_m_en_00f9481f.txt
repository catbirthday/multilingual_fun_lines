Scenario: A whistleblower who exposed corporate fraud is being held in protective custody at a tech incubator that's secretly a safehouse, where the director must convince them to testify.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You keep saying this place is for my, [bitter], protection but these glass walls and cameras make it feel more like, [anxious], an exhibit than a safehouse. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [uncertain] Look, um, I know this isn't ideal but, well, [hesitantly], the startup teams working here provide perfect cover because, er, [quietly], no one suspects a tech incubator would harbor a corporate whistleblower.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Three weeks of pretending to be interested in pitch decks while my, [shaky voice], former employer is probably planning my elimination.

Character 2 [en]: The FBI insisted, um, we maintain appearances until the trial date which means, [firmly], you need to keep attending those entrepreneur workshops even though, well, [regretful], I understand how absurd this all feels. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [bored] Yesterday someone asked me about my startup idea and I almost, [sarcastic], told them it was exposing billion-dollar fraud schemes.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Actually, um, your insights during those sessions have been, er, surprisingly valuable because you understand corporate structures better than, well, most of these kids with their apps.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Are you seriously trying to recruit me into your, [incredulous], startup ecosystem while I'm hiding for my life?

Character 2 [en]: No, I mean, what I'm saying is that, [empathetically], you've already shown incredible courage and, um, [truthful], that's exactly the kind of person who could build something meaningful. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: Building something meaningful is what got me into this, [angry], mess when I discovered those cooked books.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Well, um, the prosecutor called this morning and, er, [nervous], they're moving the trial up by two weeks which means, you know, [slowly], this arrangement ends sooner than we thought. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Thank god because watching these twentysomethings pitch their, [mocking], revolutionary apps while I'm processing trauma is, [very quietly], destroying what's left of my sanity. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] Listen, um, I've hosted hundreds of entrepreneurs here but, well, [passionate], none of them risked everything for truth like you did.

Character 1 [en]: [melancholic] The truth cost me my career and my safety and my, [trembling], entire identity while the executives who orchestrated it all are still, [loudly], playing golf at their country clubs. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Which is exactly why, um, your testimony matters because, er, [confident], without people like you these systems never change.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, sometimes I wonder if, well, [sad], I should have just kept quiet and taken the money like everyone else, I mean, [whispering], at least I'd still have a life.

Character 2 [en]: [proud] But you wouldn't have been able to live with yourself and that's, [admiring], what makes you extraordinary. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [tired] Extraordinary feels a lot like exhaustion when you're sleeping in a, [desperate], glass fishbowl surrounded by whiteboards covered in startup jargon. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [sympathetic] After you testify there's a position here if you want it because we need someone who understands, [hopeful], both innovation and integrity to mentor these founders before they lose, [worried], their moral compass to venture capital. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] Wait, you're offering me a real job after all this, um, [touched], not just another safe house pretense but an actual chance to, well, [emotional], rebuild something from these ashes? [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [smiling speaking] Well, um, absolutely, I mean, yes.
