=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [formally] सुप्रभात, मैं Davidson Land Survey से आया हूँ, अ, Riverside Commerce project के लिए preliminary measurements शुरू करने। मेरे कागज़ात के अनुसार इस पूरे पहाड़ी इलाके को इस हफ्ते के अंत तक map करना होगा।

Character 2 [mix]: [stern] आप वो map नहीं कर सकते जिसे छुआ ही नहीं जाना चाहिए। ये ज़मीन पवित्र है, हम्म, आपकी company के अस्तित्व से भी पहले से। मेरा परिवार सात पीढ़ियों से इस जगह की रक्षा करता आ रहा है, और मैं आपको—

Character 1 [mix]: [frustrated] देखिए, मैं समझता हूँ यहाँ कुछ, अरे, cultural significance हो सकती है, but I have a job to do. [sighs] Development company अब इस ज़मीन की मालिक है, legally speaking.

Character 2 [mix]: [passionately] कानूनी? आपको लगता है एक कागज़ का टुकड़ा सदियों से यहाँ आराम कर रहे हमारे पूर्वजों को मिटा देगा? [voice rising] हर पत्थर, हर पेड़ जिसे आप माप रहे हैं, they've witnessed ceremonies your instruments can't possibly comprehend.

Character 1 [mix]: [analytically] मैं बस data collect कर रहा हूँ, ठीक है? Elevation points, soil composition, drainage patterns—ये सब technical काम है। मेरी report submit करने के बाद जो भी होगा, वो, पता है ना, that's not really my department.

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] कितना सुविधाजनक है, है ना? आप माप कर चले जाएंगे, washing your hands of what comes next. [pause] क्या आपको पता भी है वे यहाँ क्या बनाने की योजना बना रहे हैं?

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] कोई, अम्म, retail complex, शायद? Maybe with residential units? [clears throat] मुझे विस्तार से नहीं बताया गया, I just follow the survey markers they provide.

Character 2 [mix]: [very quietly] Shopping mall बनाएंगे।

Character 1 [mix]: [defensively] अरे भाई, मैं ये फैसले नहीं लेता, ठीक है? मेरा भी परिवार है जिसे पालना है। [sighs heavily] लेकिन देखिए, अगर कोई specific areas हैं जहाँ आप नहीं चाहते कि मैं आज जाऊं, maybe we could work something out?

Character 2 [mix]: [warming slightly] वो oak tree से तीस कदम की दूरी पर burial mounds शुरू होते हैं। हमारे अनुष्ठान creek के पास के पत्थर के घेरे में होते हैं। [firmly] कम से कम ये जगहें, जब आप अपनी... measurements कर रहे हों, तब अछूती रहनी चाहिए।

Character 1 [mix]: [thoughtfully] ठीक है, मैं, हम्म, मैं उन्हें अपनी report में environmentally sensitive zones mark कर सकता हूँ। कभी-कभी इससे चीज़ें delay हो जाती हैं, gives people time to file appeals or whatever. [pause] ज़्यादा नहीं है, लेकिन कुछ तो है।

Character 2 [mix]: [sincerely] आप ऐसा करेंगे? Even though it might cause you trouble? ज़्यादातर surveyors बस orders follow करते हैं, वे—मतलब, they don't usually care about what we're trying to preserve here.

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] मेरे दादाजी Lakota थे। कभी ज़्यादा बात नहीं करते थे, लेकिन, अ, याद है उन्होंने कुछ कहा था... land holds memories. [exhales] मुझे अभी भी survey करना होगा, but I can be selective about what I emphasize.

Character 2 [mix]: [surprised] मैंने उम्मीद नहीं की थी—अच्छा।

Character 1 [mix]: [more confidently] उन burial mounds के पास कुछ endangered plant species भी हो सकती हैं, if you know what I mean. ऐसी खोज project को महीनों के लिए रोक सकती है, maybe even permanently. [chuckles softly] मुझे एक local guide चाहिए होगा though, कोई जो वास्तव में इस ज़मीन को जानता हो।

Character 2 [mix]: मेरी दादी इस पहाड़ी के हर पौधे को जानती थीं, मुझे उनके नाम हमारी भाषा में सिखाए थे before I learned them in English. [warmly] मैं आपको दिखा सकता हूँ कि सबसे दुर्लभ पौधे कहाँ उगते हैं, the ones that only bloom under very specific conditions.

Character 1 [mix]: [conspiratorially] बिल्कुल सही। हमें सब कुछ thoroughly document करना होगा, of course. Photos, GPS coordinates, soil samples—सब कुछ। [pause] बस उस एक section को properly survey करने में ही पूरा हफ्ता लग सकता है, wouldn't you say?

Character 2 [mix]: [with growing hope] और अगर रास्ते में हमें archaeological significance मिल जाए, well, that's an entirely different set of regulations, है ना? मेरा cousin हमारी oral histories का अध्ययन कर रहा है, mapping them to specific locations.

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] तो चलिए इसे सबसे comprehensive survey report बनाते हैं जो उन्होंने कभी देखी हो। हर protected species, हर historical marker, every single reason why this land should stay exactly as it is. [firmly] Data चाहिए था? We'll give them data.

Character 2 [mix]: [gratefully] शुक्रिया। सच में।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [formally] Good morning, I'm here from Davidson Land Survey to begin the preliminary measurements for the, uh, the Riverside Commerce project. My paperwork shows this entire hillside needs to be mapped by end of week.

Character 2: [stern] You can't map what shouldn't be touched. These grounds have been sacred for, hmm, longer than your company has existed. My family has protected this place for seven generations, and I'm not about to let you—

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I understand there might be some, errr, cultural significance here, but I have a job to do. [sighs] The development company owns this land now, legally speaking.

Character 2: [passionately] Legal? You think a piece of paper erases centuries of our ancestors resting here? [voice rising] Every stone, every tree you're measuring has witnessed ceremonies your instruments can't possibly comprehend.

Character 1: [analytically] I'm just collecting data, alright? Elevation points, soil composition, drainage patterns—it's all technical work. Whatever happens after I submit my report, that's, you know, that's not really my department.

Character 2: [bitter] That's convenient, isn't it? You measure and leave, washing your hands of what comes next. [pause] Do you even know what they plan to build here?

Character 1: [hesitantly] Some kind of, um, retail complex, I think? Maybe with residential units? [clears throat] The specifics weren't really made clear to me, I just follow the survey markers they provide.

Character 2: [very quietly] A shopping mall.

Character 1: [defensively] Hey, I don't make these decisions, okay? I've got a family to feed too. [sighs heavily] But look, if there are specific areas you'd rather I avoid today, maybe we could, uh, work something out?

Character 2: [warming slightly] The burial mounds start thirty paces from that oak tree. Our ceremonies happen at the stone circle near the creek. [firmly] These places, at minimum, should remain untouched while you do your... measurements.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Alright, I can, hmm, I can mark those as environmentally sensitive zones in my report. Sometimes that delays things, gives people time to, you know, file appeals or whatever. [pause] It's not much, but it's something.

Character 2: [sincerely] You'd do that? Even though it might cause you trouble? Most surveyors just follow orders, they don't—well, they don't usually care about what we're trying to preserve here.

Character 1: [quietly] My grandfather was Lakota. Never talked about it much, but, uh, I remember him saying something about land holding memories. [exhales] I still have to do the survey, but I can be... selective about what I emphasize.

Character 2: [surprised] I didn't expect—huh.

Character 1: [more confidently] There might also be some endangered plant species near those burial mounds, if you know what I mean. That kind of discovery can halt a project for months, maybe even permanently. [chuckles softly] I'd need a local guide though, someone who really knows the land.

Character 2: My grandmother knew every plant on this hillside, taught me their names in our language before I learned them in English. [warmly] I could show you where the rarest ones grow, the ones that only bloom under very specific conditions.

Character 1: [conspiratorially] Perfect. We'll need to document everything thoroughly, of course. Photos, GPS coordinates, soil samples—the works. [pause] Might take us all week just to survey that one section properly, wouldn't you say?

Character 2: [with growing hope] And if we happen to find archaeological significance along the way, well, that's an entirely different set of regulations, isn't it? My cousin's been studying our oral histories, mapping them to specific locations.

Character 1: [determined] Then let's make this the most comprehensive survey report they've ever seen. Every protected species, every historical marker, every single reason why this land should stay exactly as it is. [firmly] They wanted data? We'll give them data.

Character 2: [gratefully] Thank you. Really.
