Scenario: A water resources engineer confronts their brother-in-law who has been stealing water from the community irrigation system for his failing marijuana grow operation.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly seething] Encontré la bypass valve que instalaste en la línea principal de riego, Marcus. Tres meses robando agua, documentado con medidores que muestran exactamente cuánto has estado desviando.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Mira, el cultivo necesitaba más agua de la que permitían los permisos, and you know how these drought restrictions are killing small operations like mine.

Character 1 [mix]: ¿Operaciones pequeñas? Estás cultivando dos acres de cannabis ilegal detrás de ese almacén, robando agua de familias que sí respetan las restricciones. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [mix]: Esas familias no entienden las oportunidades de negocio cuando las tienen delante. Además, I was planning to pay back the district once the harvest came in.

Character 1 [mix]: [doubtfully] ¿Devolverlo? Has robado aproximadamente 400,000 galones según mis cálculos. Son 12,000 dólares en tarifas comerciales que has evitado, sin mencionar las sanciones penales.

Character 2 [mix]: [dismissive] Tus cálculos seguramente están mal. Besides, Sarah doesn't need to know about this little misunderstanding between family members, ¿verdad?

Character 1 [mix]: Mi hermana ya lo sabe. [exhales] Tuve que decírselo antes de presentar el informe al distrito de aguas mañana por la mañana. The inspectors will be there by noon.

Character 2 [mix]: [suddenly concerned] Espera, ¿en serio vas a denunciar a tu propio cuñado? Piensa en lo que esto le hace a la familia, a tus sobrinos.

Character 1 [mix]: ¿Pensaste en ellos cuando decidiste que robar a la comunidad valía la pena? Los niveles del acuífero están en mínimos históricos, Marcus.

Character 2 [mix]: [scoffing] El acuífero se recuperará con las lluvias de invierno. Vosotros los ingenieros siempre os ponéis histéricos con estas cosas, but nature finds a way.

Character 1 [mix]: ¿La naturaleza encuentra su camino?

Character 2 [mix]: [fake sincerity] Mira, aprecio todo lo que has hecho por esta familia, de verdad. Maybe we can work something out without involving the authorities.

Character 1 [mix]: Las lecturas falsificadas que presentaste, los informes de inspección falsificados con mi firma—has estado planeando esto desde que te mudaste aquí el año pasado.

Character 2 [mix]: [desperately bargaining] Desconectaré todo esta noche, pagaré la multa que creas justa. Podemos manejarlo discretamente, professionally even.

Character 1 [mix]: [coldly professional] El agua que robaste podría haber abastecido a treinta hogares durante todo el periodo de sequía del verano. Those are real families who had to cut back while you ran grow lights twenty-four seven.

Character 2 [mix]: [falsely contrite] Tienes razón, cometí errores. Pero destruir mi vida por algo de agua parece extremo, ¿no crees?

Character 1 [mix]: [incredulous] ¿Algo de agua? Cada galón que robaste venía de las reservas de emergencia para la extinción de incendios. [pause] Literalmente jugaste con las vidas de la gente por tus márgenes de beneficio.

Character 2 [mix]: Sarah me va a dejar si esto se hace público. [manipulative pause] ¿Es eso lo que quieres para tu hermana, que sea madre soltera por tus principios rígidos?

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly resolved] Ya está haciendo las maletas. El abogado de divorcios que contrató se especializa en protección de activos, especially when one spouse commits felonies that could trigger civil lawsuits.

Character 2 [mix]: [bitterly laughing] Debería haber sabido que la pondrías en mi contra también. Los ingenieros y vuestros preciosos datos, vuestros sagrados diagramas de flujo. You never understood what it takes to actually make money.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [quietly seething] I found the bypass valve you installed on the main irrigation line, Marcus. Three months of water theft, documented with flow meters showing exactly how much you've been siphoning off.

Character 2: [defensive] Look, the crop needed more water than the permits allowed, and you know how these drought restrictions are killing small operations like mine.

Character 1: Small operations? You're running two acres of illegal cannabis behind that warehouse, stealing water from families who actually follow the rationing guidelines. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: Those families don't understand business opportunities when they see them. Besides, I was planning to pay back the district once the harvest came in.

Character 1: [doubtfully] Pay it back? You've stolen approximately 400,000 gallons based on my calculations. That's $12,000 in commercial water rates you've avoided, not to mention the criminal penalties.

Character 2: [dismissive] Your calculations are probably off. Besides, Sarah doesn't need to know about this little misunderstanding between family members, right?

Character 1: My sister already knows. [exhales] I had to tell her before filing the report with the water district tomorrow morning. The inspectors will be there by noon.

Character 2: [suddenly concerned] Wait, you're seriously going to report your own brother-in-law? Think about what this does to the family, to your nephews.

Character 1: You thought about them when you decided stealing from the community was worth the risk? The aquifer levels are at historic lows, Marcus.

Character 2: [scoffing] The aquifer will recover with winter rains. You engineers always panic about these things, but nature finds a way.

Character 1: Nature finds a way?

Character 2: [fake sincerity] Look, I appreciate everything you've done for this family, really. Maybe we can work something out without involving the authorities.

Character 1: The falsified meter readings you submitted, the forged inspection reports with my signature—you've been planning this since you moved here last year.

Character 2: [desperately bargaining] I'll disconnect everything tonight, pay whatever fine you think is fair. We can handle this quietly, professionally even.

Character 1: [coldly professional] The water you stole could have supplied thirty households through the entire summer drought period. Those are real families who had to cut back while you ran grow lights twenty-four seven.

Character 2: [falsely contrite] You're right, I made mistakes. But destroying my life over some water seems extreme, don't you think?

Character 1: [incredulous] Some water? Every gallon you stole came from emergency reserves meant for fire suppression. [pause] You literally gambled with people's lives for your profit margins.

Character 2: Sarah's going to leave me if this goes public. [manipulative pause] Is that what you want for your sister, to be a single mother because of your rigid principles?

Character 1: [firmly resolved] She's already packing. The divorce lawyer she hired specializes in asset protection, especially when one spouse commits felonies that could trigger civil lawsuits.

Character 2: [bitterly laughing] Should've known you'd turn her against me too. Engineers and their precious data, their sacred flow charts. You never understood what it takes to actually make money.
