=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] When I saw this job posting for the hatchery, I never imagined you'd be, [voice shaking], the one interviewing me after all these years since art school.

Character 2 [en]: [amazed] Oh my God, Alex!

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] I know this is, um, probably weird, showing up here after I just, well, disappeared without explanation, but I really need this job. [exhales deeply]

Character 2 [en]: You vanished right before graduation and now you're, [confused], here asking to work with fish when you were the most, [emotional], talented painter I'd ever met, and I just can't, [bewildered], process this right now.

Character 1 [en]: [ashamed] There are things about my past ten years that would, [struggling], probably shock you, things I'm not proud of that made me, [heavy], give up everything including art.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, everyone has their struggles and, um, whatever happened, you're, [gentle], here now trying to start fresh which takes, [admiring], real courage.

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] The truth is I spent years creating, [hesitant], fake things, beautiful lies that looked real but were, [breaking], hollow inside, and now I just want to nurture something, [desperate], genuinely alive.

Character 2 [en]: These salmon we raise here, um, they're fighters, you know, swimming upstream against impossible odds to, [meaningful], create new life from nothing but, [inspired], instinct and determination. [smiles warmly]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] That's exactly what I need, I mean, to be part of something real and, well, honest for once. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] You know, um, when you left, I kept that painting you gave me, the one with, [nostalgic], the silver fish leaping through moonlight, and well, maybe it was, [realizing], prophetic somehow. [chuckles softly]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You still have that old thing after everything, [touched], after I abandoned our plans to open that gallery together, after I just, [regretful], walked away without even saying goodbye?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Well, um, good art transcends the artist's mistakes, and besides, I always, [knowing], believed you'd find your way back to creating something meaningful.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] I spent so many years, um, perfecting techniques to make paper look aged and, well, signatures seem authentic, but I mean, now I want to use those, [earnest], careful hands to help real life, [passionate], flourish instead.

Character 2 [en]: [encouraging] The work here requires that same attention to detail, um, monitoring pH levels and, [engaged], water temperatures with the precision of mixing paint.

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] You're actually considering hiring me despite not knowing where I've, [cautious], been all this time.

Character 2 [en]: [compassionate] Well, I mean, everyone deserves a second chance to, um, become who they're meant to be.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] I used to forge masterpieces but, um, well, now I realize the only thing worth creating is, [sincere], an authentic life, even if it means starting at the bottom. [tears up]

Character 2 [en]: [decisive] So, um, the job starts at dawn tomorrow, and well, you'll be working with living art that, [bright], swims and breathes. [extends hand]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Thank you for seeing past the person who ran away and, well, um, giving me a chance to become someone who, [committed], stays and builds something real, someone who, I mean, actually contributes to life. [shakes hand firmly]

Character 2 [en]: [heartfelt] Welcome to the hatchery, Alex, where we, um, well, we transform tiny eggs into silver miracles that will, [inspiring], someday return home against all odds.
