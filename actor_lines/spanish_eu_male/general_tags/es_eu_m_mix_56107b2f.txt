=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [trembling] Alex, I saw the campaign announcement this morning, esa foto del atardecer con la luz dorada sobre el muelle—es mi fotografía del mes pasado, la que compartí en el foro de la comunidad para pedir feedback.

Character 2 [mix]: Oh, hey! Yeah, the marketing team loved that shot so much, la metieron directamente en la campaña de verano. [casually] Deberías estar encantado, ya está teniendo un engagement increíble.

Character 1 [mix]: Nobody asked me for permission, nadie mencionó usarla comercialmente, y ahora está en vallas publicitarias y anuncios de redes sociales con la marca de agua de tu empresa reemplazando la mía.

Character 2 [mix]: Wait, I thought you knew about the terms and conditions update, la que publicamos hace 3 semanas sobre el contenido enviado por la comunidad pasando a formar parte de nuestro pool de creative commons. [uncomfortable pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [incredulous] Creative commons pool? Publiqué esa foto pidiendo consejos de composición a otros fotógrafos, no donando mi trabajo al presupuesto publicitario de una marca multimillonaria, joder!

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] The legal team assured us the new terms were crystal clear, y técnicamente, al seguir publicando después del anuncio, aceptaste los términos.

Character 1 [mix]: [building anger] You personally told me this was a safe space, que la comunidad era para apoyarnos entre nosotros, no para cosechar contenido gratis para campañas corporativas.

Character 2 [mix]: [softer] Look, I understand you're upset, y quizás la comunicación podría haber sido mejor, pero esto es realmente buena exposición para tu trabajo—miles de personas están viendo tu fotografía.

Character 1 [mix]: Exposure doesn't pay my rent, ni respeta las 40 horas que pasé editando esa imagen, y definitivamente no justifica que tú, alguien en quien confiaba, te quedaras callado mientras esto pasaba.

Character 2 [mix]: I manage seventeen different online communities, con más de 2 millones de miembros en total, [sighs] así que no puedo seguir personalmente cada pieza de contenido que pasa por el sistema, tienes que entenderlo.

Character 1 [mix]: [bitterly] But you personally commented on that photo, Alex, escribiste 3 párrafos sobre la composición y la iluminación, incluso me preguntaste sobre los ajustes de mi cámara y el proceso de edición.

Character 2 [mix]: That was me engaging as a fellow photography enthusiast, no como representante de la empresa buscando contenido utilizable—son cosas completamente separadas en mi mente.

Character 1 [mix]: [hollow laugh] So when you're building relationships and trust in the community, eso es solo tú siendo amable, ¿pero cuando explotan esas relaciones, de repente eres solo un empleado siguiendo el protocolo?

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] The truth is, la dirección ha estado presionándonos para encontrar contenido más orgánico y auténtico de usuarios reales porque las fotos de stock ya no convierten, y tu trabajo era perfecto.

Character 1 [mix]: [disgusted] So every encouraging comment, cada consejo que me diste, cada vez que me hiciste sentir que pertenecía a esa comunidad—¿todo eso era puro cultivo?

Character 2 [mix]: No, that's not—

Character 1 [mix]: [cutting off] Don't.

Character 2 [mix]: [desperately] Listen, I can try to get you a photography credit, quizás incluso negociar algún tipo de compensación retroactiva, aunque no puedo prometer nada concreto.

Character 1 [mix]: Keep it. [defeated]

Character 2 [mix]: [pleading] Please don't leave the community over this—has crecido tanto como fotógrafo, y los otros miembros realmente valoran tu perspectiva y contribuciones, esta situación no debería borrar todo eso.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [trembling] Alex, I saw the campaign announcement this morning, that sunset photo with the golden hour lighting over the pier—that's my photograph from last month, the one I shared in the community forum for feedback.

Character 2: Oh, hey! Yeah, the marketing team loved that shot so much they fast-tracked it into the summer campaign. [casually] You should be thrilled, it's getting incredible engagement already.

Character 1: Nobody asked me for permission, nobody mentioned using it commercially, and now it's on billboards and social media ads with your company's watermark replacing mine.

Character 2: Wait, I thought you knew about the terms and conditions update we posted three weeks ago about community-submitted content becoming part of our creative commons pool. [uncomfortable pause]

Character 1: [incredulous] Creative commons pool? I posted that photo asking for composition advice from other photographers, not donating my work to a multi-million dollar brand's advertising budget!

Character 2: [defensive] The legal team assured us the new terms were crystal clear about content usage rights, and technically, by continuing to post after the announcement, you agreed to them.

Character 1: [building anger] You personally told me this was a safe space for amateurs to learn and grow, that the community was about supporting each other, not harvesting free content for corporate campaigns.

Character 2: [softer] Look, I understand you're upset, and maybe the communication could have been better, but this is actually great exposure for your work—thousands of people are seeing your photography.

Character 1: Exposure doesn't pay my rent or respect the forty hours I spent editing that image, and it definitely doesn't justify you, someone I trusted, staying silent while this happened.

Character 2: I manage seventeen different online communities with over two million members total, [sighs] so I can't personally track every piece of content that moves through the system, you have to understand that.

Character 1: [bitterly] But you personally commented on that photo, Alex, wrote three paragraphs about the composition and lighting, even asked me about my camera settings and editing process.

Character 2: That was me engaging as a fellow photography enthusiast, not as a representative of the company scouting for usable content—those are completely separate things in my mind.

Character 1: [hollow laugh] So when you're building relationships and trust in the community, that's just you being friendly, but when those relationships get exploited, suddenly you're just an employee following protocol?

Character 2: [quietly] The truth is, upper management has been pushing us to find more organic, authentic content from real users because stock photos aren't converting anymore, and your work was perfect.

Character 1: [disgusted] So every encouraging comment, every bit of advice you gave, every time you made me feel like I belonged in that community—was that all just cultivation?

Character 2: No, that's not—

Character 1: [cutting off] Don't.

Character 2: [desperately] Listen, I can try to get you a photography credit on future uses of the image, maybe even negotiate some kind of retroactive compensation, though I can't promise anything concrete.

Character 1: Keep it. [defeated]

Character 2: [pleading] Please don't leave the community over this—you've grown so much as a photographer, and the other members really value your perspective and contributions, this one situation shouldn't erase all of that.
