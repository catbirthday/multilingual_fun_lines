=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, these people are, [bitter], already dead and their stuff is just, [dismissive], sitting here rotting in the rubble anyway.

Character 2 [en]: Jackson, what the, [stunned], hell are you doing with that family's, [disgusted], jewelry box in your, [cold], pack right now?

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] I mean, um, my kid needs surgery and the VA keeps, [frustrated], denying coverage, so yeah, I'm doing what I, well, [breaking], have to do here.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] We swore an oath to protect and, [measured], serve, not to profit from, [disappointed], disaster zones.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] That oath doesn't, [sarcastic], pay my daughter's medical bills.

Character 2 [en]: [careful] Listen, um, I know things have been rough since, well, [sympathetic], your wife left and the medical bills keep piling up, but this, I mean, [pained], this isn't who you are, brother.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You don't know who I am anymore, um, because the person you knew didn't have to, [hollow], choose between his honor and his, well, [voice cracking], daughter's life.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] There are other ways, I mean, we can figure this out together without you, um, [urgent], destroying everything you've worked for, everything we've, well, [pleading], survived together out here. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [withdrawn] We survived together, yeah, um, but when I got home broken, well, [bitter], nobody was there to help me survive that, I mean, [accusatory], not even you.

Character 2 [en]: [hurt] I called you every week for, um, six months after discharge and you never, well, [frustrated], picked up once, so don't tell me I, [voice rising], wasn't there for you, Jackson. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: I couldn't, um, [ashamed], face anyone after what happened in Kandahar.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] We all carry ghosts from that, [understanding], day, but stealing from earthquake victims won't, [soft], make those ghosts disappear, it'll just, [trailing off], create new ones.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Then what, [lost], am I supposed to do?

Character 2 [en]: [counseling] First, you're going to put that jewelry box back where you, um, [steady], found it, then we're going to call my cousin who runs a, well, [hopeful], veteran's advocacy group that actually gets results with the VA. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Your cousin can't, um, [skeptical], magically make thirty thousand dollars appear.

Character 2 [en]: No, but he got Martinez's, [confident], cancer treatment covered after two years of denials, and Thompson's, [encouraging], kid got the same surgery your daughter needs.

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] Even if that works, um, the surgery is in three weeks and I've already, well, [guilty], taken stuff from two other houses. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: Then we go back and, [determined], return everything tonight before anyone notices.

Character 1 [en]: Why would you risk your, um, [confused], career for me after I've already crossed this, I mean, [emotional], line that we both know there's no, well, [defeated], coming back from?

Character 2 [en]: Because five years ago you carried me, [intense], four miles through hostile territory with two bullets in your, [voice breaking], shoulder, and battle buddies don't abandon each other, [fierce], not then, not now, not ever.
