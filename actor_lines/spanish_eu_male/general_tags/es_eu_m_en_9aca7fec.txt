=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] Um, well, I know.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, I mean, whatever you think you, [shifting], found in those audio files isn't, um, what it looks, [nervous], like at all. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [measured] The spectral analysis shows clear evidence of, [cold], post-production editing on seventeen different patient interview recordings from the Phase III trials.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Well, um, sometimes the original recordings have, [shaky], technical issues that require cleaning and, I mean, [cracking], restoration work to make them audible for, [quieter], your analysis.

Character 1 [en]: [controlled] You removed coughing fits from lung cancer patients and, [sinking], smoothed tremors in voice patterns that indicated, [grave], adverse reactions to the treatment protocol.

Character 2 [en]: [concealing] I was, um, asked to enhance clarity, you know, [strained], for transcription purposes only.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] These aren't film dialogue tracks where you can, [breaking], polish imperfections for artistic effect—these are medical testimonies.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] The pharmaceutical company said the background noise was, [hollow], interfering with proper documentation requirements.

Character 1 [en]: Stop lying.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, they promised the drug would, [trembling], help thousands of people and said the audio issues were, I mean, [crumbling], creating false negatives that would, [whispered], prevent FDA approval. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [anguished] So you knew, um, you absolutely, [disgusted], knew what you were doing when you, well, [furious], cleaned up those recordings and sent them to me for, [bitter], statistical analysis.

Character 2 [en]: [guilty] I thought, er, maybe if the drug got approved it would, [sinking], actually help people and, um, the edited parts weren't, [desperate], that significant to the overall, well, [trailing off], data.

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Um, fourteen patients died during the trial and their final, [horrified], interviews are now pristine audio files with no, I mean, [shaking], indication of respiratory distress because you, well, [venomous], erased it all. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [broken] They said, um, they'd already invested, I mean, [crumbling], two billion dollars and that minor audio, er, [barely audible], corrections wouldn't change the fundamental, well, [empty], efficacy data.

Character 1 [en]: [resolute] I'm withdrawing my analysis from the FDA submission and, [steady], reporting both the data manipulation and your, [final], involvement to the federal investigators tomorrow morning.

Character 2 [en]: Please don't. [crying]

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, Dad would be, [devastated], absolutely destroyed to know what you've, well, [hollow], become.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] I have, um, two kids to support and this job, [desperate], was supposed to be my way into, I mean, [cracking], legitimate post-production work after years of, [defeated], struggling.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Well, um, those fourteen families had, [sinking], kids too who are now asking why the medicine that was supposed to, I mean, [bitter], save their parents killed them instead.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] I know what I did was, um, [broken], wrong but I can't undo it and, well, [empty], I can't live with it either. [sobbing]
