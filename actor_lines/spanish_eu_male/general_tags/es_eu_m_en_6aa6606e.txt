=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Your voice sounds so, [familiar], different but there's something about the way you, [trembling], just tilted your head that reminds me of someone.

Character 2 [en]: [careful] Well, um, I get that a lot actually, I mean, people think they, [hesitant], recognize me from somewhere but, you know, [clearing throat], it's usually just a coincidence. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [searching] No, it's the way you, [intense], tap your ring finger when you're thinking and how you, [realizing], always look up and to the left before answering difficult questions. [gasps]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] We should really focus on your, [professional], discrimination case because that's why you're here after all.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] Oh my God, Alex?

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Well, um, not anymore.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, you changed your name and became a, [shocked], lawyer and never once thought to, well, [breaking], reach out in twelve years after you just, [angry], disappeared from our lives, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Um, well, disappeared?

Character 1 [en]: [hurt] Dad searched for you for, [choking up], three years before his heart gave out and Mom still, [desperate], sets a place for you at Christmas even though we both know you're never, [hollow], coming back to that table.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Well, I mean, they made it pretty clear that, [pained], who I was wasn't acceptable in their house, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] They were wrong and scared and, [regretful], stupid but they changed so much after you left, [tearful], especially Dad who spent his last years trying to understand what he'd, [broken], done wrong.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] I, um, became a civil rights attorney because of what, [heavy], happened to me, you know, so other people wouldn't have to choose between family and identity. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, here we are with you defending me against, [ironic], discrimination when I couldn't even, umm, [guilty], defend you against our own parents back when you, [remorseful], needed me most, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] You were fifteen and scared and I mean, [understanding], caught between your big sibling and your parents, so, well, [forgiving], I never blamed you for staying silent. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [earnest] Every window display I create has, [vulnerable], some element that reminds me of you because creativity was the, [nostalgic], only language we both spoke fluently. [crying softly]

Character 2 [en]: Um, I know, actually.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You've been watching my work all these, [emotional], years even though you couldn't bring yourself to, [understanding], reach out directly?

Character 2 [en]: The mannequin you dressed in, [moved], that rainbow suit last Pride with the sign saying, [voice breaking], 'You belong here' made me finally take your case because I realized you'd been, [tender], trying to tell me something all along.

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] So maybe we can start over not as, [careful], attorney and client but as the siblings we used to be?

Character 2 [en]: I think, well, um, we're different people now but, [warm], maybe that's exactly what we need to be, you know, [thoughtful], to find our way back to each other.
