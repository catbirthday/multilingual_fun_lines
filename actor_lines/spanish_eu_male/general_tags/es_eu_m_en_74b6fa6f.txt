Scenario: An ex-girlfriend encounters her former partner now working as a meat inspector at her family's struggling butcher shop that's being investigated for health violations.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [frozen] You can't be the inspector they sent because, [voice cracking], this would be too cruel even for the universe's, [bitter], twisted sense of humor.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] I tried to, um, get someone else assigned when I saw the address, but, well, [professional], they said I had to be impartial and, [uncomfortable], besides, your father's shop needs a proper inspection anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] My father built this place with his bare, [trembling], hands forty years ago and now you're going to be the one who, [breaking], shuts it down after everything you already, [accusatory], took from me. [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: Look, I mean, I'm just doing my job here and, [defensive], the violations I'm seeing aren't personal, they're, [clinical], serious health hazards that could hurt people.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Oh please, um, don't pretend this is about public safety when you, well, [mocking], couldn't even be honest about why you left me for that, [disgusted], perfect little life in the suburbs with someone more appropriate.

Character 2 [en]: The refrigeration unit is running eight degrees too warm and there's, [matter-of-fact], black mold behind the meat counter.

Character 1 [en]: We can't afford repairs because, um, the divorce settlement you demanded took, [shaking], everything we had saved and now, well, [defeated], you show up with a clipboard to finish destroying what's left of my family. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: That's not fair and, you know, um, you're mixing up our past with, [frustrated], what's happening right now which is, I mean, [steady], your father's business is literally falling apart and making people sick.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Give us thirty days to fix it and I swear, [desperate], we'll pass every single requirement you have because this place, [voice breaking], it's all he has left after mom died.

Character 2 [en]: [conflicted] I can't just, well, ignore what I'm seeing here, but maybe, um, [reluctant], I could file it as a warning instead of immediate closure. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] You would do that after everything that happened between us, [confused], after the way we ended things with all that, [quieter], screaming and those lawyers and the, [trailing off], restraining order?

Character 2 [en]: This isn't, um, about us, it's, [firm], about giving an old man a chance to save his legacy.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Right.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, uh, I mean, despite what you think, I never, [regretful], wanted to hurt your family.

Character 1 [en]: [cold] Well, you did anyway, just like you're, um, [hollow], doing right now with that pen in your hand.

Character 2 [en]: [resolved] I'm giving you the warning which means fourteen days, [professional], not thirty, to fix everything on this, [tapping clipboard], list.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Fourteen days to resurrect a dying business while my father, [voice cracking], doesn't even remember my name most mornings or why his, [softer], butcher shop matters anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Jesus, I didn't, um, know about his condition getting that bad, I mean, [sympathetic], nobody told me he had dementia and if I'd known, well, [conflicted], maybe I could have requested a different inspector after all.

Character 1 [en]: [accusatory] You chose to disappear from our lives completely so how, [angry], would you know anything about what we've been going through these, [exhausted], past three years?

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Because walking away was the only way I could, [pained], stop destroying everything I touched, including, [barely audible], you.
