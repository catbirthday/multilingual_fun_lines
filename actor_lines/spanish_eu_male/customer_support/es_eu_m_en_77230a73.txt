=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So basically I'm, uh, calling about some referral thing that... didn't happen.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and we'll take a look at what's going on with that referral bonus, what's your account number?

Customer [en]: It's 4-4-7... no wait. 4-7-7-2-9.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, so I have your account here, ACC-47729-BN, and, um, let me just check your referral history real quick to see what might have happened.

Customer [en]: Right. So like, my friend signed up. Used my code.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay, um, so I can see here that you did submit a referral code, it's REF-8829-QM, and, uh, hmm, let me check when your friend... what's their name so I can verify the connection?

Customer [en]: James. Miller. Last week sometime.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, so, um, I'm seeing a James Miller who registered on, let me see... October 12th using your code REF-8829-QM, but, uh, there's a flag here on the bonus.

Customer [en]: Course there is. So basically what's... what's wrong now?

Customer Support [en]: Well, um, so what I'm seeing is that the system shows, uh, transaction TXN-994827-K didn't process because James didn't complete the... what's the word... the verification step within 72 hours.

Customer [en]: Verification. He signed up. That's—sorry, what verification?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so, um, after someone uses a referral code they need to, uh, verify their email AND make their first purchase within 72 hours for the bonus to trigger, it's showing here he verified but no purchase.

Customer [en]: So like, um, he has to buy something? Nobody said that.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, um, I know it's, uh, it's kind of buried in the terms but, hmm, let me see what I can... actually, oh! I see something interesting here.

Customer [en]: Interesting. Great. Just... tell me.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, James did actually make a purchase, uh, just not through the main site, he used our mobile app and sometimes the system doesn't... doesn't always sync properly with order ORD-3847-MP.

Customer [en]: So basically it's, um, your system that's broken. Not us.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, and, uh, this is totally on our end, so what I'm gonna do is manually apply that referral bonus, it's showing as credit CRD-7738-XN for fifty dollars, should hit your account within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: Fifty. Right. That's... fine. Whatever.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, um, and just to make sure everything's tracked properly, I'm giving you confirmation number CNF-449283-R for this adjustment, and, uh, is there anything else I can help you with today?
