Customer [en]: Um, so like, I bought this... what's it called... this warranty thing? And it's basically not working...

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here. Can you, er, give me your order number or, um, maybe the email you used? I'll need to, uh, verify a few things first.

Customer [en]: I don't have the order number, sorry, it's just... my email is sarah.chen at gmail.

Customer Support [en]: Got it, got it.

Customer [en]: So like, my mom's medical equipment broke and um, they're saying the warranty doesn't... I mean...

Customer Support [en]: Um, okay so I'm seeing here, uh, account ACC-5582-WN91, and there's a, er, warranty claim that was denied? Let me just, um, double-check this for you because, uh, sometimes these get flagged incorrectly.

Customer [en]: Yeah it's... it's her oxygen concentrator. She really needs it working.

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Oh that's, um, that's definitely serious. So, uh, let me look at the denial code here, it's showing DEN-7734-X and, er, basically what that means is they're saying normal wear and tear but, um, hang on...

Customer [en]: Um, but like, we've only had it for, uh, three months? That can't be normal wear...

Customer Support [en]: Right right, exactly. So, um, under consumer protection laws—and I'm, er, I'm pulling up the specific statute here, reference REG-2019-CPL—you actually have, uh, what's called an implied warranty of merchantability.

Customer [en]: So basically what does that... I mean, what does that mean for us?

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, basically even if they're denying the manufacturer warranty, uh, the law says products need to work for a, er, reasonable time. Three months for medical equipment? That's, um, that's definitely covered under statute CPL-456.2B.

Customer [en]: Um, oh wow, okay so like... they have to fix it then?

Customer Support [en]: Um, yes, so here's what we'll do. I'm gonna, uh, file a regulatory compliance claim, number RCC-8827-TK, and, er, escalate this directly. They'll have to respond within, um, 72 hours by law.

Customer [en]: That's such a relief, I was so worried because, you know, next time we might not...

Customer Support [en]: Totally understand.

Customer [en]: Um, and like, will they try to, uh, charge us for the repair or...?

Customer Support [en]: No no, so under, um, under provision CPV-881.4, they have to either, uh, repair, replace, or refund at no cost. I'm, er, I'm adding that specific citation to your case CAS-9952-LM so they can't, um, try to dispute it.

Customer [en]: Thank you so much, I mean, um, I'll make sure to keep all this information for next time, just in case...

Customer Support [en]: Of course, and, um, I'm sending you an email with case number CAS-9952-LM and all the, er, relevant consumer protection statutes. If they give you any, uh, any pushback at all, just reference that case number and, um, ask for supervisor review. They know they have to comply.
