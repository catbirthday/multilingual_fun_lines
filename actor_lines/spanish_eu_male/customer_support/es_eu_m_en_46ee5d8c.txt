=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I need to probably fix my merchant account. It says I'm retail but I sort of sell bees.

Customer Support [en]: Oh bees! That's—wow that's actually fascinating and um, totally get why that'd be miscategorized, let me pull up your account real quick, what's your business ID number?

Customer [en]: BZ-4492-K. I think they put me as general retail.

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it, BZ-4492-K, yep see it here and oh man they really did just dump you in retail category 5411, that's gonna mess up everything, your processing rates, risk assessment, the whole thing.

Customer [en]: Right. So I just need the right code I guess.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely and I'm—let me see here—agriculture's usually 0780 but bees are, what's the word, specialized? Like you're selling actual live bees not honey right?

Customer [en]: Live bees, queens, whole colonies actually. Maybe I should explain—people think it's weird.

Customer Support [en]: No no please explain! Honestly this is the most interesting call today and we need the details anyway for the reclassification form RCL-7729-M, the more specific the better.

Customer [en]: Well I breed queens mostly, ship them overnight in these special cages, and then there's package bees which are basically three pounds of bees in a box with a queen.

Customer Support [en]: Three pounds of—okay that's incredible, hmm, so livestock but tiny livestock, let me think, we might need agricultural code 0752 for animal specialty, updating your merchant profile now.

Customer [en]: And nucs. Those are sort of like starter colonies. Five frames of bees with brood and honey. People probably think I'm crazy shipping boxes of insects.

Customer Support [en]: Not crazy at all! Actually kinda brilliant? Okay so I'm documenting everything here, case number CS-8847-BEE, yes I made it spell bee, and we're gonna get this fixed today no question.

Customer [en]: Some credit cards flag it as suspicious. Probably because who spends eight hundred dollars on bees right?

Customer Support [en]: Eight hundred—wow okay yeah that'd trigger fraud alerts under retail but under livestock specialty 0752? Totally normal, I'm adding notes about typical transaction range between 200 and 1000 dollars.

Customer [en]: Spring's insane though. I process maybe forty orders a day. The system just crashes sometimes.

Customer Support [en]: Forty orders of live bees! That's—er—that's actually amazing but yeah retail classification caps at 20 daily transactions, agricultural's unlimited, switching you to high-volume AG processing tier 3 right now.

Customer [en]: Cool. I think that's everything then.

Customer Support [en]: Wait wait no, one more thing, seasonal variance flag, let me just—okay putting April through June as peak season designation PSQ2, that'll prevent any automatic holds.

Customer [en]: Oh right, yeah spring is basically when everyone wants bees.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect, so everything's updated, merchant code 0752, high-volume agricultural tier 3, seasonal variance approved, you're all set and honestly? Thanks for the education about bees, genuinely made my day learning about this.
