=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: Um, I've been doing this job for, [stern], 15 years and well, nunca había visto a alguien esconderse en el almacén de la capilla antes de un servicio, eh, especialmente no a alguien de tu edad.

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] Um, well, leave me alone, déjame en paz.

Character 1 [mix]: You know the service starts in, [hesitantly], 20 minutes, y la señora Henderson preguntó específicamente, [warm], si estarías aquí hoy.

Character 2 [mix]: She's dead so she won't, [shaky voice], know the difference anyway, y todos los demás ya piensan que no valgo para nada.

Character 1 [mix]: [knowing] The thing is, I carried her husband's casket, [empathetically], 10 years ago, y ella me dijo entonces que enseñar le salvó la vida después de que él muriera, [pause], le dio un propósito otra vez.

Character 2 [mix]: [upset] Well, um, she was the only teacher who ever, pues, que realmente vio algo en mí, ¿sabes?

Character 1 [mix]: [tough] Listen kid, um, grief isn't something you run from, [regretful], es algo que llevas contigo, eh, como yo llevo estos ataúdes, [slowly], y a veces ese peso te enseña cosas que no sabías que necesitabas aprender.

Character 2 [mix]: [anxious] Everyone out there thinks I'm just, [angry], some screw-up who disappointed her, y ahora se ha ido antes de que pudiera, [trailing off], demostrarles que estaban equivocados.

Character 1 [mix]: [present-focused] Well, um, right now you have a choice to make, eh, puedes quedarte escondido aquí o, [confidently], salir ahí fuera y ser parte del homenaje a alguien que creyó en ti.

Character 2 [mix]: [crying while speaking] Um, I don't know if I can face all those people who, bueno, que saben qué desastre he sido, ¿sabes? [sigh]

Character 1 [mix]: I mean, the hardest funerals I work are always, [very quietly], for the teachers, porque tocan tantas vidas, um, y a veces los chicos que más los necesitaban, [passionately], son los que más luchan para despedirse.

Character 2 [mix]: [frustrated] So like, um, what am I supposed to do, simplemente entrar ahí y, [whispering], fingir que merezco llorarla cuando yo, bueno, cuando nunca me convertí en lo que ella esperaba que fuera?

Character 1 [mix]: You're here aren't you, [gently], hiding in a storage room because you care too much to leave, pero te sientes, [honest], demasiado roto para quedarte, y eso me dice, [exhales], todo sobre quién ella veía en ti.

Character 2 [mix]: [very sad] Um, she used to say that, eh, las cosas rotas todavía pueden ser hermosas, ¿sabes?

Character 1 [mix]: [sincerely] In my experience carrying people to their final rest, [thoughtful], los estudiantes que se esconden en almacenes antes del servicio son normalmente, [very melancholic], de los que más hablaban sus profesores.

Character 2 [mix]: [confused] She talked about me to other people, [shocked], incluso después de todos los problemas que causé, [quietly], ¿incluso después de que me suspendieran el mes pasado? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [mix]: Well, um, probably especially then, probablemente especialmente entonces.

Character 2 [mix]: [relieved] Maybe I could sit in the back row and, [mumbling], simplemente escuchar lo que la gente dice sobre ella.

Character 1 [mix]: [intentional] I'll save you a seat up front, donde ella habría, [firmly], querido que estuvieras.

Character 2 [mix]: [determined] Um, okay, I mean, I'll try to, [trembling], hacerla sentir orgullosa una última vez aunque, bueno, aunque no esté aquí para verlo.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Um, I've been doing this job for, [stern], fifteen years and well, I've never seen someone hide in the chapel storage room before a service, er, especially not someone your age.

Character 2: [bitter] Um, well, leave me alone.

Character 1: You know the service starts in, [hesitantly], twenty minutes and Mrs. Henderson specifically asked, [warm], if you'd be here today.

Character 2: She's dead so she won't, [shaky voice], know the difference anyway and everyone else already thinks I'm worthless.

Character 1: [knowing] The thing is, I carried her husband's casket, [empathetically], ten years ago and she told me then that teaching saved her life after he passed, [pause], gave her purpose again.

Character 2: [upset] Well, um, she was the only teacher who ever, like, actually saw something in me, you know?

Character 1: [tough] Listen kid, um, grief isn't something you run from, [regretful], it's something you carry with you, er, like I carry these caskets, [slowly], and sometimes that weight teaches you things you didn't know you needed to learn.

Character 2: [anxious] Everyone out there thinks I'm just, [angry], some screw-up who disappointed her and now she's gone before I could, [trailing off], prove them wrong.

Character 1: [present-focused] Well, um, right now you have a choice to make, er, you can either stay hidden in here or, [confidently], walk out there and be part of honoring someone who believed in you.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] Um, I don't know if I can face all those people who, well, who know what a mess I've been, you know? [sigh]

Character 1: I mean, the hardest funerals I work are always, [very quietly], for the teachers because they touch so many lives, um, and sometimes the kids who needed them most, [passionately], are the ones who struggle to say goodbye.

Character 2: [frustrated] So like, um, what am I supposed to do, just walk in there and, [whispering], pretend I deserve to mourn her when I, well, when I never became what she hoped I'd be?

Character 1: You're here aren't you, [gently], hiding in a storage room because you care too much to leave but feel, [honest], too broken to stay, and that tells me, [exhales], everything about who she saw in you.

Character 2: [very sad] Um, she used to say that, er, broken things can still be beautiful, you know?

Character 1: [sincerely] In my experience carrying people to their final rest, [thoughtful], the students who hide in storage rooms before the service are usually, [very melancholic], the ones their teachers talked about most.

Character 2: [confused] She talked about me to other people, [shocked], even after all the trouble I caused, [quietly], even after I got suspended last month? [gasp softly]

Character 1: Well, um, probably especially then.

Character 2: [relieved] Maybe I could sit in the back row and, [mumbling], just listen to what people say about her.

Character 1: [intentional] I'll save you a seat up front where she would have, [firmly], wanted you to be.

Character 2: [determined] Um, okay, I mean, I'll try to, [trembling], make her proud one last time even though, well, even though she's not here to see it.
