=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [loudly] I need, um, gauze and, [frustrated], antiseptic right now—uh, people are bleeding out there and I mean, [anxious], we don't have time for your corporate checkout procedures!

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Hold on, you can't just, [confused], barge in here demanding supplies when the whole street is, [hesitantly], chaos and you're clearly part of the, [nervous], problem out there. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] Look, er, I know how this, [angry], must look but um, these are peaceful protesters who got beaten by riot police, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Wait, I know you—um, we went to Jefferson High together and, [slowly], you were always the one starting trouble even back then, uh, [shaky voice], weren't you? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Oh great, umm, now you're gonna, [sarcastic], bring up ancient history while people are, well, [very loudly], literally suffering outside because they want, you know, [speeding up], basic human rights?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] I'm not saying—look, uh, I just work here and, [whispering], I could lose my job, you know? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] Unbelievable!

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] The thing is, I actually, [torn], agree with what you're fighting for but there are cameras everywhere and, [anxiously], my manager will review everything tomorrow and, [quietly], I have a kid to feed.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] So what, um, you're just gonna let them, [furious], bleed because you're scared of losing, er, [trailing off], your minimum wage...

Character 2 [en]: It's not minimum wage actually, uh, and even if it was, well, [defensively], that doesn't make my responsibilities any less real than, umm, [firmly], your revolution out there, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [over confidently] Fine, then I'll just take what we need and, [mockingly], you can tell your precious manager that the big bad rioter overpowered you—

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] No wait, er, there's a first aid kit in the back that's, [whispering loudly], technically expired so it's supposed to be thrown out anyway, hmm?

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Are you saying what I, [hopeful], think you're saying right now?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I'm saying that, um, sometimes old classmates help each other out when, [meaningfully], the system fails us all, you know? [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] I never expected this from you, honestly—I always thought you were, [regretful], just another conformist who would never understand. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] People change after high school, and some of us, [thoughtfully], fight the system from inside it rather than, [firmly], throwing bricks at windows—both ways matter though. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [excited] Maybe when this is all over, um, we could, [hopefully], grab coffee and talk about, well, [friendly], how we both ended up here, er, [enthusiastically], fighting in our own ways? [deep pitch]

Character 2 [en]: That depends on whether, [playful], you're buying with money you earned or money from a, [joking], smashed ATM.

Character 1 [en]: Hey, I have a job too, umm, or well, [sadly], I did before all this started anyway, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Go through the back door and take what you need—the expired supplies are, [hurriedly], in the blue bins.
