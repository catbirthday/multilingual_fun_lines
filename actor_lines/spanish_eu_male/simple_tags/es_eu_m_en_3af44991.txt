=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The reports you requested are, [trembling], here but there's something else I need to, [hesitantly], discuss regarding the executions from last week that were, [very quietly], carried out in the northern district. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: You've served me for, [calmly], twenty-three years and now you come with this, [knowing], peculiar energy that suggests you have something, [dismissive], personal to say about state security matters.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] I've been reviewing the files and, um, there seems to be an error because one name, well, [confused], doesn't match the official charges that were filed.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Every execution is personally reviewed by me and the records are, [coldly], perfect so whatever discrepancy you think you've found is, [condescending], simply your failure to understand the, [slowly], complexity of maintaining order.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, I know, sir.

Character 6 [en]: Your hands are shaking which tells me you already, [thoughtfully], know the truth about your daughter's involvement with the resistance and why her name, [bitter], appears on that list you're, [monotone], pretending not to understand.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] She was only nineteen and never involved in, [crying while speaking], any political activities beyond attending university lectures.

Character 2 [en]: [formal] Well, university lectures are, um, where sedition begins, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] You've known her since she was, um, a baby and she called you uncle at every state dinner so, well, [exhausted], surely there must have been some mistake in the intelligence reports that, I mean, [breaking], led to her arrest and execution.

Character 1 [en]: Please.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] The evidence against her was overwhelming including, [enunciating every word], photographs of her distributing pamphlets that criticized my economic policies and, [mocking], questioned the necessity of our security measures which you yourself have, [sigh], helped implement for decades. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: So you knew it was, um, my daughter all along and you still, well, [devastated], signed the order while I was sitting in the next room preparing, you know, [whispering loudly], your morning briefing like nothing had changed. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Loyalty means sacrificing everything for the state including, um, family when they betray us and I mean, [calculated], you taught me that principle yourself when we, [regretful], first began this revolution together.

Character 1 [en]: The revolution we started was supposed to, [passionately], protect our children from tyranny not become the very thing we fought against.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Your grief is clouding your judgment and making you say things that, well, sound dangerously close to treason so I suggest you, um, [threateningly], remember your remaining family members before you continue this, you know, [very slowly], emotional display. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] After everything I've done for you and this regime the least you could have, [hollow], given me was the chance to say goodbye to her. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Goodbyes are a luxury that, [firmly], traitors don't deserve regardless of whose blood flows through their veins.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Then we're done here, I mean, there's nothing left to say except that, um, [bitterly], history will remember what you've become. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [confident] History is written by those who survive and maintain power which is a, [knowing], lesson your daughter failed to understand despite having the perfect teacher in you. [chuckle]
