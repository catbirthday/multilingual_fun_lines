=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [anxious] Eh, sé que esto es, [shaky voice], probablemente extraño para ti pero, bueno, mi publicista me dijo que debería, [hesitantly], venir aquí a conocerle, ya sabes, before the media finds out.

Character 2 [mix]: Bueno, eh, Marcus lleva con nosotros, [stern], 6 meses ya y, em, necesito que entiendas que él no sabe nada sobre ti, I mean, his mother never told him who his father was.

Character 1 [mix]: [whispering] A mí tampoco me lo dijo nunca.

Character 2 [mix]: Mira, em, antes de que entremos ahí, necesito que, [empathetically], entiendas que este chico ha pasado por, [frustrated], más trauma del que la mayoría de adultos podrían soportar y tu, [slowly], aparición repentina podría desestabilizar todo lo que hemos conseguido. [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: O sea, entiendo que pienses que soy solo algún, [bitter], famoso intentando limpiar mi imagen pero, bueno, cuando me enteré de él, [trembling], everything in my life suddenly felt, [exhausted], meaningless compared to this, ¿sabes?

Character 2 [mix]: [warm] Es un comienzo, pero entender sus necesidades tiene que venir antes que tu culpa.

Character 1 [mix]: [defensive] Entonces, em, ¿qué se supone que debo, [quickly], decirle a un chaval de 15 años que ha estado en, [angry], un centro de menores mientras yo vivía en una mansión jugando al, [regretful], baloncesto por millones? [sigh]

Character 2 [mix]: [calmly] Empiezas escuchando quién es él ahora, not, [passionately], apologizing for who you weren't then, porque necesita, [very quietly], estabilidad más que tus confesiones cargadas de culpa ahora mismo. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [mix]: Em, ¿le gusta siquiera el, [worried], baloncesto o, bueno, does he hate everything about me already?

Character 2 [mix]: Ve cada uno de tus partidos en la tele de la sala común pero, [confused], no sabe por qué se siente atraído a ellos.

Character 1 [mix]: [crying while speaking] Dios, quiero decir, eso lo hace, [devastated], peor de alguna manera porque, em, he's been watching his father without even, bueno, knowing it was me all this time. [groan]

Character 2 [mix]: [formal] Bueno, Sr. Thompson, em, voy a ser, [cautious], muy claro aquí—esta reunión es sobre el bienestar de Marcus, no sobre tu historia de redención.

Character 1 [mix]: [very meekly] Lo sé, em, solo quiero, [softly], hacer lo correcto por él aunque ya le he, [apologetic], fallado en todo lo que importa, ya sabes, and I don't even know where to begin.

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] Em, empiezas presentándote consistentemente, no solo hoy cuando, [skeptical], la prueba de paternidad lo hizo real, sino cada semana, [monotone], cada día de visitas, incluso cuando te rechace, bueno, even when it's hard. [laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: [desperate] Dejaré el equipo si hace falta, me, [loudly], mudaré cerca de este centro, haré, [speeding up], lo que sea necesario para demostrar que voy en serio con ser su padre. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [mix]: [thoughtful] Marcus no necesita grandes gestos, he needs, [gently], someone who won't abandon him again when things get complicated.

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] Entonces empezaré poco a poco y, [honestly], me ganaré cualquier relación que esté dispuesto a darme.

Character 2 [mix]: La puerta de su habitación está por ese pasillo, tercera a la izquierda, and he's, [nervous], expecting someone but not necessarily you.

Character 1 [mix]: [very sincerely] Gracias por, em, protegerle todo este tiempo, quiero decir, cuando yo no pude. [long pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [relieved] Solo recuerda que ganarte su confianza llevará, [patiently], más tiempo que cualquier partido que hayas jugado nunca.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [anxious] Um, I know this is, [shaky voice], probably strange for you but, well, my publicist said I should, [hesitantly], come here to meet him, you know, before the media finds out.

Character 2: Well, er, Marcus has been with us for, [stern], six months now and, um, I need you to understand he doesn't know anything about you, I mean, his mother never told him who his father was.

Character 1: [whispering] She never told me either.

Character 2: Look, um, before we go in there, I need you to, [empathetically], understand that this boy has been through, [frustrated], more trauma than most adults could handle and your, [slowly], sudden appearance might destabilize everything we've worked for. [pause]

Character 1: I mean, I get that you think I'm just some, [bitter], celebrity trying to clean up my image but, well, when I found out about him, [trembling], everything in my life suddenly felt, [exhausted], meaningless compared to this, you know?

Character 2: [warm] That's a start, but understanding his needs has to come before your guilt.

Character 1: [defensive] So, um, what exactly am I supposed to, [quickly], say to a fifteen-year-old who's been in, [angry], juvenile detention while I've been living in a mansion playing, [regretful], basketball for millions? [sigh]

Character 2: [calmly] You start by listening to who he is now, not, [passionately], apologizing for who you weren't then, because he needs, [very quietly], stability more than your guilt-driven confessions right now. [clearing throat]

Character 1: Um, does he even, [worried], like basketball or, well, does he hate everything about me already?

Character 2: He watches every single one of your games on the rec room TV but, [confused], he doesn't know why he's drawn to them.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] God, I mean, that just makes this, [devastated], worse somehow because, um, he's been watching his father without even, well, knowing it was me all this time. [groan]

Character 2: [formal] Well, Mr. Thompson, um, I'm going to be, [cautious], very clear here—this meeting is about Marcus's wellbeing, not your redemption story.

Character 1: [very meekly] I know, um, I just want to, [softly], do right by him even though I've already, [apologetic], failed him in every way that matters, you know, and I don't even know where to begin.

Character 2: [firmly] Um, you begin by showing up consistently, not just today when, [skeptical], the paternity test made it real, but every week, [monotone], every visiting day, even when he rejects you, well, even when it's hard. [laugh]

Character 1: [desperate] I'll quit the team if I have to, I'll, [loudly], move closer to this facility, I'll do, [speeding up], whatever it takes to prove I'm serious about being his father. [gasp softly]

Character 2: [thoughtful] Marcus doesn't need grand gestures, he needs, [gently], someone who won't abandon him again when things get complicated.

Character 1: [determined] Then I'll start small and, [honestly], earn whatever relationship he's willing to give me.

Character 2: The door to his room is down that hall, third on the left, and he's, [nervous], expecting someone but not necessarily you.

Character 1: [very sincerely] Thank you for, um, protecting him all this time, I mean, when I couldn't. [long pause]

Character 2: [relieved] Just remember that earning his trust will take, [patiently], more time than any game you've ever played.
