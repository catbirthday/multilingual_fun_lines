=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: You're that, [confused], bookstore lurker. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [nervous] Um, I didn't think you'd ever noticed me, I mean, sitting in the poetry section every Tuesday for, [quietly], three years while you, [hesitantly], restocked shelves and, well, deliberately avoided eye contact with everyone.

Character 1 [en]: Of course I noticed—you'd sit there, [bitter], reading Bukowski and Plath like they held some secret to life while I, [frustrated], tried to maintain my peaceful isolation.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Well, um, your bookstore was the only place where I could, [grateful], escape the pressure of my thesis, you know, where nobody expected anything from me.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Um, I don't run that place for, [stern], people like you to find themselves or whatever, I mean, it's just my way of paying bills without having to, well, talk to anyone.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] But, um, you always left fresh coffee by the reading chairs and, [thoughtful], you'd slip bookmarks with quotes into the books I was reading, and I mean, [whispering], sometimes you'd even leave new poetry collections exactly where I'd find them. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Well, um, that was just... [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, those small gestures kept me, [emotional], going through the worst parts of grad school when I thought I'd never finish.

Character 1 [en]: [gruff] Stop it. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [passionate] I mean, you pretend to hate everyone but, [sincerely], you've created this sanctuary where broken people like me can just, um, exist without judgment.

Character 1 [en]: [reluctantly] Well, I suppose if people are going to, [uncomfortable], invade my space anyway, um, they might as well be the quiet ones who, you know, actually read.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Your niece told me you almost didn't come today because crowds make you, [anxious], physically ill but you're here anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [tired] She's the only family member who doesn't try to, [resigned], fix me or drag me to social events, [very quietly], so I owed her this one appearance. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] That's something, though.

Character 1 [en]: [contemplative] Um, maybe after all these years of watching you struggle with your degree, I mean, [curious], seeing you actually graduate makes me think persistence, er, isn't completely pointless.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] You know, um, I was planning to leave you a thank-you note at the store but, [shaky voice], saying it in person even though you clearly want to, well, [trembling], escape this conversation means more than you know.

Character 1 [en]: [awkwardly] Your thesis on isolation in modern poetry that you left on the counter last week was, [impressed], surprisingly insightful for someone so, [begrudgingly], young.

Character 2 [en]: [laughing] Wait, you actually read it even though you always said, [amused], academic writing was pretentious garbage that, [playful], killed the soul of literature? [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [caught] I might have, [embarrassed], skimmed it during a particularly slow afternoon when there were no customers to avoid and nothing else to, [muttering], distract me from my own thoughts. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Thank you for being exactly who you are—someone who taught me that, [discovering], caring doesn't always have to be loud.
