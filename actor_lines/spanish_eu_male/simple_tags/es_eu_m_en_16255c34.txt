=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [sharp] Your silver coins mean nothing to me when I can see, [loudly], the real treasures you're hiding beneath that cloth.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, I don't know what kind of, [frustrated], trained bird you are but, I mean, these goods are, [stern], legally acquired and you have no right to, you know, perch here disrupting my business. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [calculated] The merchant who owned me traded in more than, [whispering], spices and silk, and I've memorized every face, [slowly], every transaction that passed through his, [bitter], bloodstained ledgers.

Character 2 [en]: You're suggesting, um, that I somehow, [anxious], knew about his other dealings when all I did was, well, purchase legitimate inventory from, [hesitantly], what appeared to be a respectable caravan.

Character 1 [en]: [progressing] Um, legitimate is an interesting word when, I mean, half your silk bears the, [accusingly], royal seal that was, you know, reported stolen three moons ago, [quietly], along with the princess's entire dowry.

Character 2 [en]: [nervous] Look, er, I bought those pieces in good faith and, well, you know, [whispering loudly], accusations from a bird won't exactly hold up with the magistrate.

Character 1 [en]: [confident] My talons have drawn blood from men who thought, [menacingly], animals couldn't testify, yet here I am with, [methodical], names, dates, and routes memorized.

Character 2 [en]: Even if what you're, [carefully], claiming has merit, what exactly do you, [suspicious], want from me besides destroying my livelihood?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Freedom from the chains that bound me to him, and perhaps, [empathetically], a partnership with someone who understands survival.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Partnership?

Character 1 [en]: My eyes see what humans miss in their, [quickly], rushed transactions, and my memory holds secrets that could, [passionately], make us both wealthy or destroy us both.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So, um, you're proposing that, well, we work together using your, [intrigued], intelligence gathering abilities and, I mean, my established trade connections?

Character 1 [en]: [serious] Er, yes, though first we need to, um, relocate that stolen silk before the, [urgently], royal investigators arrive. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: You knew they were coming and, well, you could have simply, [angry], flown away, but instead, um, you're warning me about, [confused], investigators who haven't even been dispatched yet.

Character 1 [en]: [matter-of-fact] Well, um, I watched them arrest your, er, former supplier this morning, and they'll trace his, [grimly], records here within two days at most. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Then, I mean, we have less time than I thought to, well, forge new documents and, [exhausted], create a believable alternate source.

Character 1 [en]: [triumphant] Um, I already know three merchants who'll vouch for you if we, well, share certain, [slyly], information about their competitors.

Character 2 [en]: [impressed] You've been planning this, um, escape for longer than just today, and somehow you, [amazed], chose my stall out of hundreds in this, well, market. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [sincere] Your ledgers show honest dealings in everything except what you bought from him, [gently], suggesting desperation rather than corruption.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Then we have an accord, though I never imagined my, [wry], business partner would have feathers and talons instead of, [amused], hands to shake on it.
