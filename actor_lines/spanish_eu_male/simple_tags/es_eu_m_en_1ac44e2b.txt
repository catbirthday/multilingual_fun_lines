=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Um, I know this is, well, [pause], incredibly difficult to hear, but Rusty's condition is more serious than we initially thought. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] So you're, um, you're saying that, [shaky voice], he's not going to get better without, like, [trailing off], without something major?

Character 1 [en]: The tumor on his liver is, [very quietly], pressing against other organs and causing him significant pain right now.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] Well, um, how long?

Character 1 [en]: [warm] I, uh, I understand.

Character 2 [en]: Um, he's been with me through, well, [clearing throat], everything—sleeping under bridges, getting kicked out of, [hesitantly], shelters because they wouldn't take dogs. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Look, um, I need you to know that, [slowly], there are options here, though they're, [pause], not easy ones, and I want to, like, [short pause], help you through whatever you decide.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Options always come with, [loudly], price tags that people like me can't afford, don't they?

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] The surgery would cost around three thousand dollars, but, [relieved], our clinic has a fund for situations exactly like this one. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Wait, you're saying there's actually, [whispering], a way to help him without me having to choose between his life and—

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, the fund can cover, hmm, [passionate], about seventy percent of the cost, and we can, [formal], work out a payment plan for the rest, or even, er, [sniffle], waive it entirely depending on your situation.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] So, um, you mean there's, like, [laugh], actually hope for my old boy after all?

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] There's definitely hope, and we have, [confidently], one of the best veterinary surgeons in the state who specializes in, [friendly], exactly this type of procedure.

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] You know, um, when you're homeless, people, well, [stuttering], they d-don't usually go out of their way to, [whispered loudly], help you or your dog.

Character 1 [en]: Every life matters here, um, and honestly, I can, [deep pitch], see how much Rusty means to you. [cry]

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] I should have brought him in sooner but I was, [frustrated], afraid of the bill and, [mocking], afraid of the judgment I always get.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] Well, you're here now, and, um, that's, [monotone], what matters most for Rusty's recovery. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: He saved my life more times than I can, well, [speeding up], count—kept me warm on freezing nights, warned me about, [high-pitched], dangerous people approaching, never once, um, [very slowly], left my side even when I had nothing to feed him. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [delighted] Then let's make sure we can, [enunciating every word], save his life in return, because dogs like Rusty, [joking], they're the real heroes in this world. [belly laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [very excited] Um, when can we, like, [sleepily], schedule the surgery because I don't want him to, [animatedly], suffer any longer than he already has, you know?
