[warm] He's pointing things out, explaining the difference between the organic and the regular pasta sauce like he's been doing this for years. [chuckle] I mean, just last week he couldn't even make eye contact when I said good morning. [very quietly] And now he's... [trailing off] \n\n[happy] He's recommending the store brand! [animated] His hands are moving, he's actually, like, engaged in the conversation—this is incredible. [empathetically] I remember being that terrified kid once, you know? [slowly] The one who'd rather reorganize the entire stockroom than talk to a single customer. [relieved] But something clicked for him today, I guess. [pause] Maybe it was all those practice sessions we did, or maybe—[extremely happy] oh she's smiling! The customer is actually smiling and nodding! [laugh] Marcus just made a joke? [delighted] He made a joke! [very sincerely] This is honestly the best thing I've seen all week."
