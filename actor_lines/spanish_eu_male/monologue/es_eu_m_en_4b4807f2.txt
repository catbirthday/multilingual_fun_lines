Subject: The restructuring advisor delivered the news that your department is being dissolved and your team scattered across the company

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confused] Dissolved? What do you mean dissolved? [pause] We just—we literally just landed the Morrison account last month. [shaky voice] I don't understand how this is even... [sigh] 

So wait, let me get this straight. They're just, um... they're breaking us up? After everything? [frustrated] Seven years. Seven years we've been building this team and they're just— [long pause]

God, I keep thinking about Sarah. She just bought that house, you know? And Marcus, he... hmm, he turned down that other job to stay with us. [sad] I told him we were solid. I told him this was a good place to be. 

[very quietly] Where are they even sending everyone? [pause] Different divisions? So we won't even... we won't see each other? [bitter] That's convenient. Break up the one department that actually talks to each other, right? 

[sigh] I mean, I guess I should've seen this coming when they brought in that consultant. They always—ugh, they always do this. Come in with their spreadsheets and their, their "efficiency models" and they don't... [trailing off]

[exhausted] I just can't believe I have to tell my team this. How do I even—how do I look them in the face and say it's over? [very sad] We were supposed to be different.
