I can't—[crying while speaking] they said she'd never walk again. Remember? Six months ago, that neurologist just looked at us and said, um... said the damage was too extensive. [bitter] \"Manage your expectations,\" he said. Like I was supposed to just, what, give up on my baby? \n\n[shaky voice] But look at her now. She's so determined, you know? The way she grips the parallel bars and just... pushes through. Every single day. Physical therapy at seven AM, and she never complains. Never. [sniffle] I mean, sometimes I see her face scrunch up when it hurts, and I want to—God, I just want to make it stop hurting. But she keeps going. \n\n[extremely happy] Four steps! Did you see that? Four! Her left leg is still, er, still dragging a bit, but who cares? [laugh] The doctors don't know everything, do they? They don't know how stubborn she is. How brave. [warm] That's my girl. That's my fighter. We're gonna walk out of here together. Both of us. On our own feet."
