=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [anxious] They're calling me in. After all these years of, um, trying to leave that life behind, and now—[short pause]—now they actually need me. The avalanche took out the main trail, and there's, like, fourteen hikers trapped up there. [bitter] Funny how everyone suddenly forgets what they think of mercenaries when, you know, lives are on the line. 

[clearing throat] The thing is, I mean, they're right. I know those mountains. Spent three winters there doing... well, [trailing off] ... anyway, that doesn't matter now. What matters is I can rappel down that north face in, er, basically any weather. I know how to set charges to clear debris without causing secondary slides. [confidently] Hell, I've extracted people from way worse situations than this.

[sigh] It's just strange, right? All those skills I learned for, hmm, let's call them "different purposes"—[pause]—and now they're exactly what these families need. [warm] Their kid is up there. Seventeen years old. Same age as my nephew. 

[resolved] So yeah, I'm going. Obviously I'm going. Maybe, I don't know, maybe this is what all that training was actually for. [quietly] Maybe this makes some of it... worth it.
