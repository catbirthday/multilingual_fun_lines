Speaker [en]: [gasp softly] Look at that. Just... look at that finish. No flash, no porosity, perfect fill on every detail. [very excited] You did it! You actually—I mean, this is exactly what we've been working toward for months. [warm] Remember your first day? You couldn't even get the temperature right, and now look at this piece. It's, um, it's honestly better than some of my early work. [chuckle] Way better, actually.

[slowly] You know, teaching someone this craft, it's like... well, you hope they'll get it, but you never really know until a moment like this. [emotional] I'm just—I'm really proud of you, kid. [clearing throat] Sorry, I'm getting all... anyway. The way you adjusted the injection speed on that last attempt? That was pure instinct. You can't teach that kind of feel for the metal.

[passionately] This is what it's all about, you know? Passing on the knowledge, watching someone discover they have the touch. [pause] Your parents are going to flip when they see this. Hell, I might frame it myself. [laugh] 

[confidently] From here on out, it's just refinement. But this? This perfect piece? This means you're a real die caster now. Not an apprentice anymore. [very sincerely] Welcome to the guild, my friend.
