[pause] Remember that night after the convoy job? Everyone was celebrating, counting their caps, and you pulled me aside. [chuckle] I thought you were gonna lecture me about my sloppy shooting. But instead you asked me, \"Is this really what you want to be doing in five years?\" [very sincerely] Nobody had ever asked me that before. Nobody cared enough to. [sigh] I got so defensive, told you to mind your own business. But that question, it, um... it stuck with me. Every raid after that, I kept hearing your voice. [sad] Looking at the people we were hurting, the fear in their eyes—I couldn't unsee it anymore. [pause] You didn't give up on me though. Even when I was being a complete ass, you kept checking in. Kept reminding me there were other ways to survive out here. [grateful] Now I'm running supply routes, actually helping settlements instead of—instead of destroying them. [emotional] My kids, they don't have to grow up ashamed of who their parent was. That's because of you. [very quietly] You saved more than just my life. You saved theirs too."
