[sniffle] Said the tomatoes we grew taste like the ones from her childhood garden back home.\n\n[exhausted] God, remember that week in July when the aphids hit? I thought we were done for. [anxious] I was up at four in the morning, basically hand-spraying every single plant with that neem oil mixture, and I kept thinking—[trailing off] what if I can't save them? What if I let everyone down?\n\n[relieved] But we didn't. We actually didn't. [chuckle] The lettuce yield alone was, um, triple what we expected. [very excited] And those pumpkins! [animated] Marcus's kids literally couldn't carry them, they were so huge! [pause] \n\n[quietly] It's funny, I used to manage that commercial greenhouse, right? Made good money, grew perfect roses for rich people's weddings. [bitter] But this—[warm] watching the Johnsons fill their bags with fresh peppers, teaching little Sofia how to tell when corn is ready—[very sincerely] this is what matters. [happy] This is what I was meant to do."
