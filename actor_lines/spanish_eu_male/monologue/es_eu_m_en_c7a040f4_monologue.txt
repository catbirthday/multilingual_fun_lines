Speaker [en]: School is pointless? That's what you just—okay, um, let's just... [pause] take a step back here for a second. I mean, I get it, I really do. [empathetically] Trust me, when I was your age, there were definitely days when I thought the exact same thing, you know? Like, why am I learning about the Pythagorean theorem when I'm never going to—actually, that's not the point.

[frustrated] The thing is, dropping out isn't just about—it's not that simple, alright? Your future, your options, they all... [trailing off] Look, I know school feels pointless right now. Honestly, sometimes the curriculum is—well, it's outdated, sure. [sigh] But here's what I need you to understand, okay? 

This isn't really about algebra or, uh, Shakespeare or whatever. [passionately] It's about keeping doors open that you don't even know exist yet! I've seen so many kids—brilliant kids like you—make this decision and then five years later they're... [very sad] they're stuck, you know? 

Can we at least, er, talk about what's really going on here? [gently] Because "pointless" usually means something else entirely. Is it the classes? The other students? Something at home? Just—[pause] just give me a chance to help before you make this decision. Please.
