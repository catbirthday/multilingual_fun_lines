It's, um, it's honestly better than some of my early work. [chuckle] Way better, actually.\n\n[slowly] You know, teaching someone this craft, it's like... well, you hope they'll get it, but you never really know until a moment like this.

You can't teach that kind of feel for the metal.\n\n[passionately] This is what it's all about, you know? Passing on the knowledge, watching someone discover they have the touch.
