Had this beautiful baby girl and they'd just bought their first house. [pause] And they came to me because, well, their friend told them they needed insurance but they were so hesitant about spending the money. I mean, I get it, they were barely making ends meet. [empathetically] But something about them... I don't know, I just really wanted to help them find something that would work. So we sat there for, gosh, probably three hours going through every option. Found them this plan that was, um... it was tight for their budget but it covered what they needed. [shaky voice] Six months later, the dad got diagnosed with lymphoma. Six months. Can you imagine? [sigh] The medical bills would've been, I think, four hundred thousand? Something insane like that. But their coverage... it saved them. They didn't lose their house, didn't have to declare bankruptcy, nothing. [very sincerely] The mom sent me this card afterward with a picture of all three of them at his remission party, and she wrote \"you saved our family.\" [pause] That's why I do this job. Not for the commission checks or whatever. It's for moments like that. [quietly] Sometimes you really do change someone's life."
