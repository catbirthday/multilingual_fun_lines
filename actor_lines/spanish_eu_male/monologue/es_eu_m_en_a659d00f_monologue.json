[clearing throat] Sorry, I'm, um, getting all choked up here. So like, three months ago when he rolled in—well, wheeled in, I guess—he was so frustrated because, you know, his grip strength is limited from the accident. [passionately] And I thought, okay, here's the thing, we need to completely reimagine how drilling works for him. \n\nI mean, basically every measurement had to be perfect. [slowly] The thumb pitch, the span, especially that lateral adjustment for his wrist mobility—honestly, it was millimeters that made the difference. [pause] And today, err, watching him throw that final strike... [crying while speaking] I'm sorry, it's just—the look on his face, you know? \n\n[warm] All those late nights recalculating, and like, testing different layouts, the custom inserts I had to special order—God, I was so worried it wouldn't work. But then, [laugh] he comes up to me after with the trophy and goes \"You gave me my game back.\" [very sincerely] That's why I do this job, right there. That's, uh—that's everything."
