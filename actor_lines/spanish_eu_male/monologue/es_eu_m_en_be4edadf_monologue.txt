Speaker [en]: Twenty-three years I've been fixing horns in this shop. Twenty-three. And now, um, I get maybe two customers a week? [bitter] The thing is, everyone just goes to that MusicMax down on Route 9 because they offer—I mean, what do they offer, really? [frustrated] Some kid who watched a YouTube video telling them their valve needs replacing when it's literally just, like, a stuck spring? 

[sigh] I keep thinking about Mr. Henderson's trumpet last month. Brought it to them first, right? They told him the whole valve block needed replacing—eight hundred dollars. [angry] Eight hundred! So he comes to me, and you know what it was? [pause] A bent water key. Fixed it in ten minutes for thirty bucks. 

But honestly, it doesn't matter anymore. [very melancholic] People see the big shiny store and they just... they assume it's better. And I'm sitting here with, er, forty years of experience—my dad taught me, his dad taught him—and it's like none of that means anything. [slowly] I've got maybe three months left before I can't make rent.

[long pause] Well, anyway, Mrs. Chen's bringing her son's trombone tomorrow. [sad] Probably my only appointment this week. I should, um—I should probably start looking at job listings or something. [trailing off] Maybe MusicMax is hiring...
