Subject: Your unlikely hero moment getting you recognition from the same people who used to bully you

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confused] I still can't believe they actually... they actually clapped for me. [short pause] The same people who used to, um, who used to shove me into lockers are now calling me a hero. [laugh] It's so weird, you know? Like, Brad Martinez—remember Brad? [bitter] He made my life hell for three years. And today he's posting about how "brave" I am on Instagram. [sarcastic] Oh wow, thanks Brad. 

[hesitantly] I mean, I didn't even think about it when I saw that kid choking. I just... I just did the Heimlich, you know? [shaky voice] My hands were shaking so bad afterwards. But then everyone started filming and suddenly I'm, err... I'm some kind of hero? [uncomfortable laugh] The whole cafeteria was cheering and I'm standing there thinking—these are the same people who laughed when someone dumped chocolate milk on my head.

[very quietly] Part of me wants to tell them all to go to hell. [pause] But then... I don't know, maybe this changes things? [hopeful] Maybe they'll actually see me as a person now instead of just, hmm, their favorite target? [sad] God, that's pathetic isn't it? Still wanting their approval after everything. [sigh] 

[frustrated] I saved someone's life and all I can think about is how the popular kids finally know my name.
