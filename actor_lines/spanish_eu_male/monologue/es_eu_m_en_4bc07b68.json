The same person who, um, literally ate lunch alone for three years straight. [chuckle] I mean, back then I thought I was broken or something, you know? Like genuinely thought there was something wrong with how I saw things. [sad] Nobody wanted to hear that maybe—maybe we didn't need another pep rally, or that the whole social hierarchy thing was, I don't know... arbitrary? [pause] But now? [animated] God, now that's exactly what they pay me for. To be the one who says \"wait, why are we doing it this way?\" [laugh] Sarah literally told me yesterday that I'm the only one who catches the blind spots. [warm] And I'm thinking... well yeah, when you spend four years on the outside looking in, you get really good at seeing what everyone else misses. [slowly] All those lunch periods watching how groups formed, how people, um... how they followed patterns without even realizing it. [excited] That's literally my job now! [very sincerely] Pattern recognition. User behavior. Finding the assumptions nobody questions. [trailing off] It's like... I don't know, all that loneliness was actually training. [confidently] Weird, right? The thing that made me so miserable then is what makes me indispensable now."
