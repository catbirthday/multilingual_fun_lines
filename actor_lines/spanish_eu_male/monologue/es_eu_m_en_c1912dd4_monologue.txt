Speaker [en]: Okay, router's back online, switch is green—we should be good. [relieved] Oh thank God, finally. I mean, you know how these rural connections can be, right? [anxious] The whole school's counting on this for state testing and, uh, the pressure is just—wow. [short pause] Let me just ping the gateway real quick. [mumbling] Eight milliseconds, twelve, nine... [excited] Yes! We're stable!

The thing is, [frustrated], when they called me this morning saying five hundred kids couldn't log in, I literally thought—I don't know, my heart just dropped. [empathetically] These kids, they only get one shot at this test, and honestly, some of them drove like an hour to get here. [passionate] Can you imagine? Living somewhere with no internet at home, and then, [upset], the school connection dies during the most important test of the year?

But anyway, [cheerful] we got it! Turns out it was just a, um, a faulty ethernet cable in the main junction box—can you believe that? [chuckle] One stupid cable! [proudly] But hey, that's why they pay me to drive two hours out here, right? [warm] These kids deserve the same chances as everyone else. Actually, let me just—[trailing off] yeah, all the testing servers are responding. [extremely happy] We did it! We actually did it!
