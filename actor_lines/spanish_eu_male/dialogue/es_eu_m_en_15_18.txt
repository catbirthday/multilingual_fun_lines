Character 1 [en]: Hey, did you manage to fix that bug in the payment system yet?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yes! I finally tracked it down [overly polite] after about six hours—turns out it was this tiny typo in the API callback that was causing the entire checkout process to fail silently.

Character 1 [en]: Six hours for a typo? That's, um, frustrating—you know, I've been there though, basically spent a whole day once on a missing semicolon.

Character 2 [en]: The worst part is, err, I kept thinking it was, I mean, something complex with the payment gateway integration but it was literally just "paymnet" instead of "payment" in the response handler—I wanted to actually scream.

Character 1 [en]: Oh man, so those kinds of bugs are, like, the absolute worst because you're looking for something big and honestly miss the obvious.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly! And our linter wasn't catching it because it was inside a string literal that gets parsed by the payment processor—classic case of the simplest problems taking the longest to solve.

Character 1 [en]: Did the client notice the downtime?

Character 2 [en]: Thankfully no, but they were, well, [curious] asking why their analytics showed a bunch of abandoned carts—I had to kind of explain that users were trying to pay but, hmm, the system wasn't processing anything properly.

Character 1 [en]: That could've been bad—uh, did you lose any, the thing is, actual sales or were they sort of recoverable?

Character 2 [en]: We sent out cart recovery emails to everyone affected and offered them a discount code, so we managed to recover about seventy percent of the transactions which honestly could've been much worse.

Character 1 [en]: Seventy percent recovery is actually pretty good for that kind of issue.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, though now I'm paranoid and I've written like three different automated tests just for that one function—probably overkill but I never want to deal with that particular nightmare again.

Character 1 [en]: Three tests for one function? [gasp] That's—ah, I mean really thorough but I guess better safe than sorry.

Character 2 [en]: Trust me, after explaining to the project manager why we lost thirty percent of potential sales to a typo, I'd rather over-test than have that conversation again in my lifetime.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Did they—uhh, were they angry about it or, anyway, understanding since it's just that these things happen?

Character 2 [en]: Surprisingly understanding actually—she said she once deleted an entire production database by accident, so my typo seemed relatively minor in comparison to that particular disaster.

Character 1 [en]: She deleted a production database? How do you even recover from that?

Character 2 [en]: Apparently they had backups from four hours earlier but still lost a bunch of customer data—made my little typo feel like a tiny hiccup rather than the catastrophe I'd built it up to be.

Character 1 [en]: That's actually terrifying—er, makes me want to double-check, you know, all our backup systems right now.

Character 2 [en]: Do it! I now run backup checks every Friday afternoon because nothing ruins a weekend faster than discovering on Monday morning that your backups haven't been working for the past two weeks.
