Character 1 [en]: My fish keeps staring at me. Is that normal?

Character 2 [en]: Fish do watch their owners, but if it's [crying while speaking] following you constantly around the room, that actually means it's bonded with you. They recognize faces after about ten days of regular feeding.

Character 1 [en]: Ten days? Mine's been doing this since day one.

Character 2 [en]: That's [sad] unusual but not impossible—some fish are just naturally more curious or social. Bettas and oscars especially tend to have bigger personalities than people expect.

Character 1 [en]: Do fish dream?

Character 2 [en]: Scientists think, um, they might experience something, you know, similar to REM sleep. Their brain activity patterns, actually, change during rest periods just like ours do.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, so, are they, like, dreaming about swimming or, err, eating?

Character 2 [en]: Nobody knows for sure, but, well, zebrafish studies show they, basically, replay daytime activities in their sleep patterns. It's, honestly, probably how they consolidate memories about predators and food sources.

Character 1 [en]: That's, um, [very excited] absolutely wild! Do they, you know, remember their dreams or, actually, forget them like we do?

Character 2 [en]: Given their memory spans—goldfish can, hmm, remember things for months, not seconds—they probably, well, retain some of it. But, I mean, without language, we can't exactly ask them about their nighttime adventures.

Character 1 [en]: My fish makes bubble nests. Is he lonely?

Character 2 [en]: Bubble nests actually mean he's happy and ready to mate, not lonely. Male bettas blow these nests when conditions are perfect—warm water, good food, feeling secure in their territory.

Character 1 [en]: Should I, uh, get him a girlfriend? Or would that, like, end badly?

Character 2 [en]: Badly, definitely badly. Male bettas will fight females unless it's breeding time, and even then they need separate tanks afterward or he might kill her protecting the nest.

Character 1 [en]: That escalated quickly.

Character 2 [en]: Fish romance is [very quickly] brutal—males guard territories, females eat their own eggs if stressed, and some species change gender when needed. Nature doesn't mess around with fish reproduction; it's all about survival efficiency, not feelings.

Character 1 [en]: Can fish, err, hear music? Mine seems to, actually, react when I play piano.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely! Fish detect vibrations through their lateral line system and inner ears, so they're actually feeling your piano through the water. Some aquarium fish can even be trained to respond to different tones.

Character 1 [en]: I think [crying while speaking] mine hates jazz though.

Character 2 [en]: Jazz might create irregular vibration patterns that stress him out. Try something with a steady beat—surprisingly, many fish seem to prefer classical or soft rock over complex rhythms.
