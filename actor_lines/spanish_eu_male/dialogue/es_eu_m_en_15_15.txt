Character 1 [en]: You think you've got it all [condescending] figured out, don't you, Detective Chen?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, the blood spatter patterns don't lie—and, uh, neither does the security footage showing you entering at 11:47. You're the only one with motive, access, and honestly, the skill set to pull this off.

Character 1 [en]: Security footage? That's [laugh] rich! You know, I was, um, actually in Bangkok that night—ask anyone at the conference.

Character 2 [en]: Bangkok? That's your alibi? We checked [frustrated] the flight manifests already! Your name appears on zero international departures that week—nice try though.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I used a different name.

Character 2 [en]: A different name... right. So, er, you're admitting to identity fraud now? That's, you know, another felony to add to the list—and honestly, it doesn't help your murder case.

Character 1 [en]: Murder? Who said anything about murder?

Character 2 [en]: Nobody had to say it—the body [smiling speaking] speaks for itself. Actually, here's the thing, your lawyer called it an "unfortunate accident" but, um, accidents don't require seventeen stab wounds.

Character 1 [en]: Seventeen? Your forensics team miscounted.

Character 2 [en]: Miscounted? What are you, uh, [confused] suggesting exactly? Like, you know the real number? Because, I mean, that would be quite the admission right there.

Character 1 [en]: I'm suggesting that [regretful] maybe you should check who trained your medical examiner.

Character 2 [en]: Dr. Morrison has thirty years of experience—so, basically, she doesn't make those kinds of mistakes. The thing is, you're grasping at straws here, and, well, it's getting pathetic.

Character 1 [en]: Pathetic? You know, that's, um, exactly what Victoria said about you—right before she, er, disappeared.

Character 2 [en]: Victoria contacted you? When? She's been underground for three months—if you've been in communication, that changes everything!

Character 1 [en]: Changes everything... Sure it does. Anyway, I guess you never, um, checked her sister's apartment in Queens, did you?

Character 2 [en]: Her sister lives in Boston, [over confidently] not Queens! See, actually, this is how I know you're lying—every detail you give, well, it just proves how desperate you've become!

Character 1 [en]: Boston? Hmm, that's interesting because, you know, I have photos of them together at, uh, that Vietnamese place on Roosevelt Avenue.

Character 2 [en]: Photos can be doctored—timestamps can be faked! You're really reaching now, aren't you?

Character 1 [en]: You want to know what's [bitter] really reaching? The way you've been, like, building this case on, basically, nothing but assumptions and, er, circumstantial garbage.

Character 2 [en]: Circumstantial? We have your fingerprints on the [groan] murder weapon! I mean, that's pretty damn concrete—unless you're suggesting, well, someone borrowed your hands for the evening?
