Character 1 [en]: OH MY GOD OH MY GOD I just got the BEST idea ever we should totally start a band RIGHT NOW!

Character 2 [en]: Whoa whoa whoa, slow down there! Um, I love the enthusiasm, actually, but you know, starting a band takes a bit more planning than just deciding on a whim.

Character 1 [en]: But but but I already [hesitantly] picked out stage names—well, I guess mine would be Lightning Fingers and yours could be, sort of, Thunder Voice!

Character 2 [en]: Lightning Fingers and Thunder Voice? That's... surprisingly not terrible actually. Though I should probably mention I haven't touched an instrument since middle school band class.

Character 1 [en]: WHO CARES we'll [cough] figure it out as we go I'M BUYING A KEYBOARD TODAY!

Character 2 [en]: Hold on, [mumbling] before you drop serious cash on instruments, maybe we should figure out what kind of music we'd even play? Rock, pop, electronic, jazz fusion?

Character 1 [en]: ALL OF THEM! We'll be genre-bending pioneers! Revolutionary! GAME-CHANGING!

Character 2 [en]: So that's, honestly, incredibly ambitious, but er, most successful bands actually start by mastering one style before branching out into experimental territory.

Character 1 [en]: You're thinking too small! We need to EXPLODE onto the scene!

Character 2 [en]: Exploding onto the scene sounds great in theory, but realistically we'd need to practice, write songs, find a drummer, maybe a bassist, book venues...

Character 1 [en]: I can play drums with my FEET while playing keyboard—uh, I saw it on YouTube once, kind of looks easy, basically anyone can multitask!

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, playing drums with your feet while... I mean, that's definitely something, but the thing is, coordination like that takes years to develop properly.

Character 1 [en]: Years schmears! We're young! We're ALIVE! Uhh, like, who needs years when you have RAW PASSION—anyway, I'm calling music stores RIGHT NOW!

Character 2 [en]: Your energy is absolutely infectious, I'll give you that. But before you max out your credit card, what if we started with something simpler, like writing a song together?

Character 1 [en]: WRITING! YES! I have [deep pitch] seventeen notebooks FULL of lyrics about pizza and heartbreak and SPACE TRAVEL!

Character 2 [en]: Seventeen notebooks? Ah, that's really impressive actually, though it's just that mixing pizza with heartbreak and space travel might be a challenging thematic combo.

Character 1 [en]: Challenging is GOOD! You know, umm, all the best artists were told they were crazy—right so, we're basically already halfway to GENIUS STATUS!

Character 2 [en]: I admire your complete lack of self-doubt, seriously. Most people spend years paralyzed by fear before even attempting something creative.

Character 1 [en]: Fear is for people who DON'T—well, [enunciating every word] honestly have seventeen notebooks of pizza space heartbreak lyrics—actually I'M TEXTING EVERYONE WE KNOW ABOUT OUR BAND!

Character 2 [en]: Wait wait wait! Err, before you announce us to the world, basically shouldn't we at least, I think, decide on an actual band name first?
