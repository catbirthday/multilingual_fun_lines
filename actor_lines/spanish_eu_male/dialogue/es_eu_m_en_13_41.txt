Character 1 [en]: This whole "knowledge management system" you're pushing is ridiculous. We don't need another database, we need people to actually talk to each other!

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I hear you, I really do. The frustration with, um, adding yet another system on top of everything else is totally valid. But what if we could actually make communication better, not replace it?

Character 1 [en]: That's what they all say. Then we spend months documenting everything and nobody reads it.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Yeah, that's... that's honestly what happens with most systems, you're absolutely right. But I think the issue is that, uhh, we usually build these things backwards - we focus on storing information instead of, like, making it genuinely useful when people actually need it.

Character 1 [en]: So what, you're different? You've cracked the code that billion-dollar companies haven't?

Character 2 [en]: No no, not at all! I'm just saying that, mmm, maybe we start smaller? Like, instead of documenting everything, we could just capture the stuff that people keep asking about over and over - the real pain points, you know?

Character 1 [en]: People ask different questions every time. There's no pattern to it.

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, see, that's interesting because when I tracked our Slack for a month, about sixty percent of questions were, er, variations of the same five topics. People just phrase them differently, so it seems like chaos but there's actually patterns underneath all that noise.

Character 1 [en]: You tracked our Slack? That's creepy and exactly the kind of surveillance culture I'm talking about!

Character 2 [en]: Oh gosh, no, I should've explained better - I just did a word frequency analysis on public channels, nothing personal or private. It was literally just to understand what topics come up most, not who was saying what, I promise.

Character 1 [en]: Still feels like you're trying to replace human expertise with some wiki that'll be outdated in a week.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Actually, that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid! The whole point is to, uhh, free up our experts from answering the same basic questions so they can focus on the complex stuff that actually needs their brain power, you know what I mean?

Character 1 [en]: But the "basic" questions are how juniors learn! You're destroying mentorship!

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, you're touching on something really important there. But what if documenting the basics actually creates more space for real mentorship? Like, instead of explaining where the printer is for the hundredth time, mentors could actually, er, dig into strategic thinking with their mentees?

Character 1 [en]: That's not how learning works. People need context, stories, not just facts in a database.

Character 2 [en]: You're absolutely right about stories! That's why I'm thinking we should, um, capture those too - like little case studies or "here's how Sarah solved this problem" narratives, not just dry documentation. People learn from stories way better than bullet points.

Character 1 [en]: And who's going to write all these stories? We're already drowning in actual work!

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, workload is... it's a huge concern, definitely. What if we made it super lightweight though? Like, after solving something interesting, you just voice-record a two-minute explanation while it's fresh, and we transcribe it later?

Character 1 [en]: [animated] Voice recordings? So now we're podcasters too? This just keeps getting more absurd!

Character 2 [en]: Okay okay, I hear how it sounds, but honestly? People already explain stuff verbally all day long in meetings and Slack huddles - we're just, uhh, suggesting we capture some of that knowledge instead of letting it disappear into the void every single time.
