Character 1 [en]: So this is it, huh? Last day at the training center. Feels weird packing up after five years.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] Yeah, I'm, um, I'm not handling this well at all, honestly. Remember when we first walked in here thinking we'd make the Olympic trials like Simone Biles just, you know, waltzed her way to gold? God, we were so naive.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Don't remind me about trials! I still can't believe they chose Richardson over me for the relay team!

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] I know, I know, that was... sheesh, that was brutal to watch. But hey, you ran a personal best that day, and honestly, the way USA Track and Field makes those decisions is, uh, it's pretty arbitrary sometimes, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Personal best doesn't mean anything if you don't make the team. Where are you headed after this?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I got picked up by the Nike Oregon Project, which is, mmm, kind of surreal actually. They want me training at Hayward Field where Pre ran all those legendary races, so I guess I'll be moving to Eugene next month.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Nike? Are you serious? That's... that's huge! Why didn't you tell me?

Character 2 [en]: I literally just found out yesterday, and I've been, like, processing it still. Alberto Salazar's whole scandal kind of tainted the program but they're rebuilding with new coaches and, um, apparently they think I have potential for the Boston Marathon next year.

Character 1 [en]: Boston? But you're a middle-distance runner! Since when do you run marathons?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, no, I know it sounds crazy but they think my 5K times translate well to longer distances. Plus, errm, Shalane Flanagan's been mentoring some of us and she basically said if I can handle the training load, Boston's totally achievable.

Character 1 [en]: [laugh] Shalane Flanagan is mentoring you? This keeps getting more ridiculous!

Character 2 [en]: Right? It's completely insane, like, she's won New York City Marathon and now she's just casually giving me advice about fueling strategies. Oh, and she introduced me to Eliud Kipchoge at a Nike event last week, which was, uh, basically the most intimidating five minutes of my entire life.

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Well, I'm staying here and training independently. No more coaches telling me what to do.

Character 2 [en]: Whoa, okay, that's... that's pretty bold actually. You know most people who go self-coached end up burning out, right? I mean, even Usain Bolt had Glen Mills guiding him through everything, and he's literally the fastest human ever.

Character 1 [en]: Bolt had natural talent. I have to do this differently. Besides, the Diamond League circuit doesn't care who coaches you.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Look, the Diamond League absolutely cares about your support system, and going solo is, mmm, it's basically career suicide at this level. You need physiotherapists, nutritionists, someone analyzing your form - this isn't high school track anymore where raw talent gets you through.

Character 1 [en]: [gasp] Wait, is that Coach Martinez walking in? I thought he already left for Real Madrid's training staff!

Character 2 [en]: [yawn] Oh yeah, he's just, uhh, grabbing his last boxes I think. Man, from training sprinters to working with Cristiano Ronaldo - that's quite the career pivot, honestly, though I guess sports science is sports science wherever you go.

Character 1 [en]: Should we say goodbye? It feels weird just watching him pack.

Character 2 [en]: Definitely, yeah, let's go help him carry stuff out. You know, he's the one who told me to watch Serena Williams's mental game footage, said champions think differently, and, erm, I guess we'll find out if he was right about us having that mindset too.
