Character 1 [en]: So, um, is this your first time on, you know, one of these sunset cruises, or are you, like, a regular?

Character 2 [en]: First time, actually! I won a raffle at my hospital's charity event—never thought I'd actually use it, but here I am, drinking champagne with strangers while the sun sets.

Character 1 [en]: Hospital? Oh, er, are you, I mean, a doctor or, well, something else medical?

Character 2 [en]: Pediatric surgeon, actually—I fix [groan] tiny hearts for a living, which, honestly, sounds way more romantic than the reality of, you know, eighteen-hour shifts and, um, endless paperwork.

Character 1 [en]: Tiny hearts? That's incredible! Must be intense work.

Character 2 [en]: Intense doesn't even begin to cover it—yesterday I operated on a three-month-old, and today I'm here trying to forget about tomorrow's triple bypass on a seven-year-old who loves dinosaurs.

Character 1 [en]: Wow. And here I thought my [monotone] job trading cryptocurrency was stressful.

Character 2 [en]: Cryptocurrency? Oh god, so, you're one of those Bitcoin millionaires, or, I mean, are you the type who, actually, lost everything in, uh, that recent crash?

Character 1 [en]: Neither, really—I, um, mostly work with, you know, smaller altcoins and, er, institutional clients who want to diversify.

Character 2 [en]: That sounds, well, incredibly complicated—I can barely, like, manage my regular checking account, and, honestly, the whole blockchain thing just, um, makes my head spin.

Character 1 [en]: It's not—ah, actually, excuse me, [sneeze] sorry—it's not, um, as complicated as, you know, rebuilding tiny hearts though.

Character 2 [en]: Fair point! Though, err, at least hearts follow predictable patterns—they don't, you know, crash overnight because, basically, some billionaire tweeted something ridiculous, right?

Character 1 [en]: You'd be surprised how similar they are, actually—both about timing, patterns, and knowing when to take calculated risks.

Character 2 [en]: Calculated risks... is that what you'd call standing here talking to a complete stranger while this boat rocks like crazy? Because I'm definitely feeling less calculated and more queasy by the minute!

Character 1 [en]: The rocking? Oh, well, that's nothing—you should, er, try trading during, like, Asian market hours when everything's volatile and, um, you're half-asleep.

Character 2 [en]: Half-asleep and making financial decisions sounds, hmm, absolutely terrifying—though I guess, actually, that's basically my life during, you know, emergency surgeries at 3 AM.

Character 1 [en]: Do you, uh, ever worry about, I mean, making mistakes when you're, like, that exhausted?

Character 2 [en]: Every single day—but that's why we have teams, protocols, and enough coffee to kill a horse. The adrenaline helps too, especially when you're holding someone's entire future in your hands.

Character 1 [en]: That's, um, remarkably [formal] similar to what I do, though, well, obviously the stakes are, er, quite different financially versus, you know, medically.

Character 2 [en]: True, but hey, at least when you, like, lose money, nobody's parents are, well, crying in the waiting room—though, actually, I bet some of your clients get pretty, um, emotional too, right?
