=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Tomorrow you take your final certification and I need to, [emotional], tell you something before you become a master craftsman that, [proud], changes everything between us.

Character 2 [en]: [nervous] Master Chen, you're scaring me because you've never been this, [worried], serious even when I nearly burned down the workshop that first month.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] My grandfather gave me these tools when I was your age and now, [voice breaking], after watching you grow these three years, they belong to you. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] These are the Chen family tools that have been, [overwhelmed], passed down for six generations and you're giving them to, [trembling], me instead of your own son who's been waiting, [disbelieving], his whole life for them. [gasps softly]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] Well, um, my son chose business school over the craft, and you know, you're the one who, [passionate], stays late practicing joints until your hands bleed, who, [moved], dreams in wood grain patterns, I mean, like I used to.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] Um, Master, I don't deserve this honor because, well, I'm just an orphan who stumbled into your shop, [ashamed], begging for work and you already, [grateful], saved my life by taking me in, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Blood doesn't make family, dedication does, and these tools have, [serious], always chosen their next keeper not through birthright but through, [meaningful], recognizing hands that understand the soul of the craft, [reverent], the way yours do.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitant] But, um, what will people say when they see me, I mean, carrying the Chen tools, [fearful], knowing I'm not even Chinese, well, knowing I'm just, [vulnerable], some kid from the streets? [voice cracks]

Character 1 [en]: [protective] They'll say nothing because they'll be too busy admiring the work you, [fierce], create with them. [chuckles warmly]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] If you truly believe I'm worthy of this legacy, then I promise to, [solemn], honor every lesson you've taught me.

Character 1 [en]: [nostalgic] You know, um, when my grandfather gave me these tools, er, he said the same thing I'm about to, [wise], tell you now. [sighs deeply]

Character 2 [en]: [attentive] Every stroke you make with these tools carries not just your skill but the, [respectful], wisdom of those who held them before, including now, [emotional], you Master Chen.

Character 1 [en]: [tearful] Well, umm, that's exactly what he said, but you know, hearing you understand it without being told means, [fulfilled], I've succeeded as a teacher in ways I never, [grateful], imagined possible, I mean, truly succeeded. [sniffles]

Character 2 [en]: [confident] Tomorrow when I take that test, I won't just be proving my skills but showing the world what the, [proud], Chen teaching method can accomplish.

Character 1 [en]: These tools have built temples and homes for, [historical], two hundred years but I suspect their greatest work is still, [hopeful], ahead of them in your talented, [believing], young hands. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Master Chen, before you retire and leave the shop, there's something I've wanted to, [struggling], ask you for three years but never found the courage to, [desperate], say until now because time is, [urgent], running out.

Character 1 [en]: [knowing] Well, um, if you're asking whether you can call me father, er, the answer has been yes since the day you, [loving], carved your first perfect dovetail joint, you know. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: Um, Dad, I mean, that's the first time I've ever, [overwhelmed], been able to say that word to anyone and, well, it feels like coming, [peaceful], home after a lifetime of wandering, you know, truly home. [crying softly]

Character 1 [en]: [joyful] Son, tomorrow isn't just your final test, it's your, [proud], first day as my heir. [embracing]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Thank you, father.
