=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Um, Your Grace, I need to, [trembling], tell you something before I accept this commission—well, I mean, it's about the blade that took your husband's life.

Character 2 [en]: [cold] I know.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] You, um, you know?

Character 2 [en]: I've known for three years that you forged the, [steady], Damascus steel that pierced his heart, um, and I've spent every night since then, well, imagining this moment.

Character 1 [en]: [anguished] The pattern in that blade still, [breaking], haunts my workshop—I see it in every piece of steel I fold.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Well, that's precisely why I'm here, um, because I need you to forge something that will, [deliberate], either destroy or redeem us both.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Your Grace, I mean, I've tried to quit this trade a hundred times but my hands, [shaking], won't let me—they keep returning to the forge like, um, they're seeking absolution.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] The knife I'm commissioning isn't for, [careful], revenge—it's for the ritual where I'll finally, [wavering], release his memory and perhaps, [bitter], forgive myself for surviving.

Character 1 [en]: Um, every blade carries the soul of its maker, and well, if I forge this for you, [trembling], part of me will be there when you, [choking], perform that ritual—I mean, is that what you want?

Character 2 [en]: [intense] I need the man who armed my husband's killer to, [fierce], arm me for this final act, um, because only then will the circle close properly.

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] The weight of that first blade nearly, [cracking], destroyed me, and now you're asking me to carry, [exhausted], another burden that might finish what the first one started.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] This blade will cut through grief, not, [tender], flesh—it will sever the chains we've both been dragging. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Then I'll forge it with the same, [reverent], dedication I gave to that cursed Damascus steel. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: Um, when you fold the metal, I mean, think of it as folding time itself—each layer, [mystical], erasing a moment of pain we've both endured.

Character 1 [en]: The furnace will need to burn hotter than usual because, well, this steel must be, [technical], pure enough to hold intentions rather than just, [weary], an edge—um, such work requires sacrifice.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Um, I'll watch. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] Your Grace, the forge is no place for someone of your, [concerned], station—the heat alone could, [worried], overwhelm you. [shifts nervously]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] I watched my husband die in my, [raw], arms so I think I can endure watching you, [steady], create something from fire and metal, um, don't you?

Character 1 [en]: [accepting] Then we'll stand together in that heat and, [solemn], smoke while I transform raw metal into something that might, [hopeful], finally bring us both peace—though I warn you, [dark], the forge reveals truths we sometimes prefer to keep buried. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Well, um, good. [exhales]
