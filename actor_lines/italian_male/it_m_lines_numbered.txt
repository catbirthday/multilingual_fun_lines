# Speaker Lines Only (Translated) - Italian (Male)
============================================================

1. [nervous] Master Chen, you're scaring me because you've never been this, [worried], serious even when I nearly burned down the workshop that first month.
2. [stunned] These are the Chen family tools that have been, [overwhelmed], passed down for six generations and you're giving them to, [trembling], me instead of your own son who's been waiting, [disbelieving], his whole life for them. [gasps softly]
3. [crying] Um, Master, I don't deserve this honor because, well, I'm just an orphan who stumbled into your shop, [ashamed], begging for work and you already, [grateful], saved my life by taking me in, you know.
4. [hesitant] But, um, what will people say when they see me, I mean, carrying the Chen tools, [fearful], knowing I'm not even Chinese, well, knowing I'm just, [vulnerable], some kid from the streets? [voice cracks]
5. [determined] If you truly believe I'm worthy of this legacy, then I promise to, [solemn], honor every lesson you've taught me.
6. [attentive] Every stroke you make with these tools carries not just your skill but the, [respectful], wisdom of those who held them before, including now, [emotional], you Master Chen.
7. [confident] Tomorrow when I take that test, I won't just be proving my skills but showing the world what the, [proud], Chen teaching method can accomplish.
8. [vulnerable] Master Chen, before you retire and leave the shop, there's something I've wanted to, [struggling], ask you for three years but never found the courage to, [desperate], say until now because time is, [urgent], running out.
9. Um, Dad, I mean, that's the first time I've ever, [overwhelmed], been able to say that word to anyone and, well, it feels like coming, [peaceful], home after a lifetime of wandering, you know, truly home. [crying softly]
10. [whispered] Thank you, father.
11. Please, [quiet], sit down first.
12. [rehearsed] Dr. Martinez, I've been going through, [careful], our quality control logs from March as part of the audit, and I discovered that the specimen labeled with, [trembling], Emma's patient ID was actually processed with the wrong, [voice cracking], reagents which means the negative result we reported might not be accurate.
13. [struggling] I'm saying that, um, when I ran the backup sample tonight with the correct reagents, well, the markers we should have caught, [heavy], three months ago are showing abnormal values that, er, indicate early-stage ALL.
14. Um, I know, I mean, God, I know.
15. [anguished] I've been sitting here since eight o'clock rehearsing, um, how to tell you this, and I mean, there's no version where I don't sound like I've, [broken], potentially cost your little girl her life, but I couldn't wait until morning because every, [desperate], hour matters now. [voice breaks]
16. [determined] Listen, I've already called Dr. Chen in oncology and she's, [urgent], waiting for you both right now, and I've expedited every single test we need to run tonight to, [desperate], get accurate staging immediately.
17. [pleading] Dr. Martinez, I know there's nothing I can say that, well, that fixes this, but um, I discovered this error on my own time, during a voluntary audit that, [guilty], nobody asked me to do because something felt wrong about that batch.
18. [quietly] I've been in this lab for fifteen years and, um, I've processed thousands of pediatric samples, but I mean, tonight when I saw your daughter's name and realized, [haunted], what I'd missed, I threw up in the sink and then ran the test four more times, [broken], hoping I was wrong somehow.
19. If it matters at all, and I mean, I know it probably doesn't right now, but the type of error suggests she's still in the, [hopeful], early enough stages for aggressive treatment to be highly effective. [whispers]
20. [resolute] I'm going to be here all night running every test myself, and I'll personally ensure that from this moment forward, [fierce], every single result is triple-checked, even if that means I never leave this lab again until Emma is, [determined], in full remission. [pause]
21. [coldly] Business is business.
22. [cynical] Look, um, tribute acts are a dime a dozen and, well, [slowly], yours stopped drawing the crowds we need, so I mean, that's just how Vegas works. [trailing off]
23. Your father was the one who, [hesitantly], convinced me to give you a chance when you were just, [regretful], a kid with a dream and a jumpsuit.
24. [defensive] He asked me to keep it professional and not let sentiment, [stern], cloud my judgment about your career. [cough]
25. [apologetic] Your father was the best Elvis I ever saw perform, and watching you, [very quietly], struggle to fill his shoes has been harder than you know. [groan]
26. [empathetically] Well, um, that's not what I meant, and er, I actually kept you on longer than, [nervously], any other act because I owed him that much, you know, [quickly], but the board made the final decision. [pause]
27. [warm] No, I mean, you earned your spot every night, but um, your father made me promise to, [whispering], give you a real chance, and well, [relieved], I kept that promise as long as I could.
28. [sincerely] Actually, um, there's a smaller venue downtown that's looking for, well, [hopeful], a headliner, and I mean, I already made the call. [chuckle]
29. [very melancholic] Just take the job.
30. Well, your father would've said the same thing, and um, [smiling speaking], maybe that's why he chose me to watch over you all these years.
31. [confused] I honestly don't know what you're, [nervously], talking about here, maybe you're, [defensive], mistaking me for someone else entirely.
32. Those files were for legitimate, [hesitantly], backup purposes and management specifically approved my, [quietly], overtime work schedule for disaster recovery planning. [clearing throat]
33. [overly polite] Perhaps we should, um, discuss this with HR present because, [calmly], I mean, these are serious accusations you're making without, [formally], proper evidence or authorization. [sigh]
34. [frustrated] Look, uh, I've been with this company for, [raising voice], three years and my record is spotless, so, [quickly], whatever conspiracy theory you're pushing, well, it's going to blow up in your face. [cough]
35. [anxious] You're making dangerous connections that simply, [monotone], aren't there and jeopardizing both our careers with these paranoid delusions.
36. [very quietly] You went to the FBI without any real proof, just, [stuttering], c-circumstantial evidence that could be explained by, [desperately], normal work activities, and now you've potentially ruined, [trailing off], everything I've been working on...
37. [resigned] Fine. [short pause]
38. [exhausted] You have no idea what you've just destroyed because I wasn't stealing, [very sincerely], data from this company, I was actually planted here to, [whispering], protect it from the real infiltrator who's been operating under everyone's nose. [gasp softly]
39. [cold] Was. [deep pitch]
40. The real mole is probably, er, already destroying evidence and preparing to disappear while we're here having this, [bitterly], pointless confrontation thanks to your need to play hero. [cry]
41. [warm] Mrs. Henderson, I mean, I understand how overwhelming this must be, and um, I want you to know that, [empathetically], we're going to work through every single charge together, and er, we have options that can, [relieved], significantly help with this burden. [pause]
42. [mollifying] Well, um, the first thing I need you to know is that, [gently], nobody expects you to pay all of this, I mean. [sigh]
43. [apologetic] Those automated notices should never have gone out, and um, I'm going to personally make sure they, [stern], stop immediately while we work on getting you qualified for our, [confidently], financial hardship program, you know.
44. [sincerely] This isn't charity, Mrs. Henderson—it's a program specifically designed for situations, [passionate], exactly like yours.
45. [reassuring] Well, I mean, based on what you've told me, um, Harold sounds like someone who would want you, [caring], protected and taken care of above all else, you know.
46. Um, Mrs. Henderson, I'm going to personally handle your case and, [determined], make sure we reduce this to something manageable, I mean.
47. [touched] Well, um, I think your granddaughter and I would agree that, [hopeful], healthcare should heal people, not bankrupt them, and er, that's why I do this job—to fix what's, [firmly], broken in the system when I can, you know. [clearing throat]
48. [excited] Um, I mean, absolutely there is!
49. [uplifting] Well, Mrs. Henderson, um, by the time you leave today, er, we'll have eliminated at least ninety percent of this debt and, [triumphant], Harold's legacy will be exactly what it should be—love and memories.
50. You're going to be, [optimistic], okay, Mrs. Henderson—I promise you that. [warm smile]
51. [self-assured] Well, um, I'm actually here on business, you know, one of my clients needs, [hesitantly], professional help for her teenage son who's been, [anxious], struggling with depression and, I mean, self-harm lately. [pause]
52. [defensive] It's legitimate work that pays, [firmly], three times what you make here, and my clients trust me enough to, [warm], help their families when they're, [quietly], falling apart behind their perfect facades.
53. [confidently] The mother already filled out everything and she's willing to pay, [earnestly], double your usual rates for discretion and immediate intervention.
54. [empathetically] Look, um, this kid reminds me of myself at fifteen, you know, before everything fell apart with, [regretful], dad and the family.
55. [melancholic] There are different ways of self-destruction and mine was just, [slowly], more socially acceptable until it wasn't anymore.
56. The thing is, like, I never wanted to disappoint you but, um, [ashamed], staying in touch meant facing your judgment about my choices, you know?
57. [relieved] She would've hated everything about my life now but at least I can, [proudly], afford to put flowers on her grave every week.
58. [vulnerable] Every Thursday at sunset, um, just like she used to love watching from the hospital window, you know, [shaky voice], before the cancer took that away too. [long pause]
59. Thank you for doing this even though I probably don't, [grateful], deserve your help after disappearing the way I did, [apologetic], without any explanation or goodbye.
60. [smiling speaking] I'd like that.
61. [groan] Two hundred new subjects? Are you—are you kidding me right now? I literally just finished organizing my schedule and now they drop this on us. [frustrated] Like, how am I even supposed to choose? There's "Advanced Biomimicry in Urban Design" and, um, "Theoretical Applications of Quantum Psychology"—what does that even mean? [pause] Wait, actually some of these look kind of amazing. [curious] Oh my God, they have a whole section on sustainable fashion tech now. And look—"Storytelling Through Data Visualization"—I've been wanting something like that forever. [excited] This changes everything! I mean, I already registered for my boring requirements but now I could actually take something I care about, you know? [anxious] But the deadline is tomorrow. Tomorrow! How am I supposed to review two hundred options by tomorrow? My advisor is going to kill me if I change everything again. She already thinks I'm indecisive. [sigh] Maybe I could just... swap out one class? [hopeful] Yeah, just one wouldn't be that bad. Or two. [trailing off] God, who am I kidding, I'm going to be up all night completely redoing my entire academic plan, aren't I? [laugh] This is such a disaster but honestly? [smiling speaking] Kind of the best disaster ever.
