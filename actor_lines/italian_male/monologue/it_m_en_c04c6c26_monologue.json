[frustrated] Like, how am I even supposed to choose? There's \"Advanced Biomimicry in Urban Design\" and, um, \"Theoretical Applications of Quantum Psychology\"—what does that even mean? [pause] Wait, actually some of these look kind of amazing. [curious] Oh my God, they have a whole section on sustainable fashion tech now. And look—\"Storytelling Through Data Visualization\"—I've been wanting something like that forever. [excited] This changes everything! I mean, I already registered for my boring requirements but now I could actually take something I care about, you know? [anxious] But the deadline is tomorrow. Tomorrow! How am I supposed to review two hundred options by tomorrow? My advisor is going to kill me if I change everything again. She already thinks I'm indecisive. [sigh] Maybe I could just... swap out one class? [hopeful] Yeah, just one wouldn't be that bad. Or two. [trailing off] God, who am I kidding, I'm going to be up all night completely redoing my entire academic plan, aren't I? [laugh] This is such a disaster but honestly? [smiling speaking] Kind of the best disaster ever."
