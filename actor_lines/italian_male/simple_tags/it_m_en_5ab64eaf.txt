=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I know what you've been doing, um, all those late nights with the, [angry], server access logs, well, I've been tracking every single move you make.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] I honestly don't know what you're, [nervously], talking about here, maybe you're, [defensive], mistaking me for someone else entirely.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Don't you dare play dumb with me because I have, [shaky voice], screenshots and timestamps that prove you've been, [loudly], copying classified project files and sending them to, [pause], external servers every Thursday night.

Character 2 [en]: Those files were for legitimate, [hesitantly], backup purposes and management specifically approved my, [quietly], overtime work schedule for disaster recovery planning. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Disaster recovery doesn't require encrypted tunnels to servers in, [trembling], Eastern Europe or coded messages that look like, [speeding up], weather reports but contain embedded data packets. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [overly polite] Perhaps we should, um, discuss this with HR present because, [calmly], I mean, these are serious accusations you're making without, [formally], proper evidence or authorization. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Oh yes, let's definitely involve HR who mysteriously, [mockingly], hired you without proper background checks right after our main competitor suddenly started, [laughing], matching every single one of our product releases.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Look, uh, I've been with this company for, [raising voice], three years and my record is spotless, so, [quickly], whatever conspiracy theory you're pushing, well, it's going to blow up in your face. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [whispering loudly] Three years of perfect cover, um, until someone finally noticed the patterns, I mean, [passionately], the timing of your sick days matching major data breaches at our subsidiaries.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] You're making dangerous connections that simply, [monotone], aren't there and jeopardizing both our careers with these paranoid delusions.

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Well, um, the FBI cybercrime unit I contacted yesterday seemed, [stern], very interested in my paranoid delusions, especially after I showed them, er, your hidden partition. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] You went to the FBI without any real proof, just, [stuttering], c-circumstantial evidence that could be explained by, [desperately], normal work activities, and now you've potentially ruined, [trailing off], everything I've been working on...

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Everything you've been working on, hmm, that's an interesting choice of words, um, for someone who claims, [slow], to be innocent. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Fine. [short pause]

Character 1 [en]: [excited] So you're finally admitting that my suspicions were, [triumphantly], correct all along about your real purpose here at the company.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] You have no idea what you've just destroyed because I wasn't stealing, [very sincerely], data from this company, I was actually planted here to, [whispering], protect it from the real infiltrator who's been operating under everyone's nose. [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Wait, you're saying, um, there's another spy and you're actually, [confused], like, some kind of counter-intelligence operative or something? [gasp loudly]

Character 2 [en]: [cold] Was. [deep pitch]

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Oh God, I mean, if what you're saying is true then I've, [horrified], basically just exposed an undercover operation and put everyone at risk.

Character 2 [en]: The real mole is probably, er, already destroying evidence and preparing to disappear while we're here having this, [bitterly], pointless confrontation thanks to your need to play hero. [cry]
