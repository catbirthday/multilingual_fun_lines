=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: These bills keep coming even though Harold's been, [shaky voice], gone for three months now and I don't understand how they can be, [confused], this much when Medicare was supposed to cover, [very quietly], everything.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Mrs. Henderson, I mean, I understand how overwhelming this must be, and um, I want you to know that, [empathetically], we're going to work through every single charge together, and er, we have options that can, [relieved], significantly help with this burden. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Harold always handled the finances and now I'm sitting here with, [crying while speaking], forty-seven thousand dollars in bills that I couldn't pay even if I, [frustrated], sold everything we owned including the house we built, [trembling], together in 1973.

Character 2 [en]: [mollifying] Well, um, the first thing I need you to know is that, [gently], nobody expects you to pay all of this, I mean. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] The hospital certainly seems to expect it when they send, [anxious], collection notices to a grieving widow every single week.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Those automated notices should never have gone out, and um, I'm going to personally make sure they, [stern], stop immediately while we work on getting you qualified for our, [confidently], financial hardship program, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] Well, um, I worked as a teacher for thirty-five years and, [proudly], never asked for charity in my life, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] This isn't charity, Mrs. Henderson—it's a program specifically designed for situations, [passionate], exactly like yours.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I mean, um, Harold would be mortified if he knew I was sitting here, [embarrassed], discussing our finances with a stranger like this.

Character 2 [en]: [reassuring] Well, I mean, based on what you've told me, um, Harold sounds like someone who would want you, [caring], protected and taken care of above all else, you know.

Character 1 [en]: [tearfully] He spent his last days worrying about leaving me with, [angry], all this debt instead of focusing on saying goodbye, and that's something I'll, [regretful], never forgive this hospital system for taking from us. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Um, Mrs. Henderson, I'm going to personally handle your case and, [determined], make sure we reduce this to something manageable, I mean.

Character 1 [en]: You remind me of my granddaughter with that, [nostalgic], determined look in your eyes when she sets her mind to helping someone, [smiling speaking], though she's studying to be a doctor which feels, [ironic], rather ironic given the circumstances. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: [touched] Well, um, I think your granddaughter and I would agree that, [hopeful], healthcare should heal people, not bankrupt them, and er, that's why I do this job—to fix what's, [firmly], broken in the system when I can, you know. [clearing throat]

Character 1 [en]: [grateful] Maybe there's hope for this mess after all if there are still, [relieved], young people like you who actually care about more than just, [skeptical], bottom lines and profit margins. [soft laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Um, I mean, absolutely there is!

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Harold fought in Korea and built highways across three states, and now I'm fighting, [exhausted], insurance companies and bill collectors just to keep his memory from being reduced to a, [bitterly], credit score that follows me to my own grave. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [uplifting] Well, Mrs. Henderson, um, by the time you leave today, er, we'll have eliminated at least ninety percent of this debt and, [triumphant], Harold's legacy will be exactly what it should be—love and memories.

Character 1 [en]: Thank you, dear. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: You're going to be, [optimistic], okay, Mrs. Henderson—I promise you that. [warm smile]
