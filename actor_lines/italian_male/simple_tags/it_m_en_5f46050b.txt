=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Marcus, what are you doing here at the community center after, [confused], five years of complete radio silence from you?

Character 2 [en]: [self-assured] Well, um, I'm actually here on business, you know, one of my clients needs, [hesitantly], professional help for her teenage son who's been, [anxious], struggling with depression and, I mean, self-harm lately. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] So you're still doing that, um, that work you started after dropping out of college, I mean, [disappointed], escorting or whatever you prefer to call it these days?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] It's legitimate work that pays, [firmly], three times what you make here, and my clients trust me enough to, [warm], help their families when they're, [quietly], falling apart behind their perfect facades.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] You know, um, I can't just take referrals from, well, [whispering], someone in your profession without proper documentation and parental consent forms.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] The mother already filled out everything and she's willing to pay, [earnestly], double your usual rates for discretion and immediate intervention.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] This isn't about money, Marcus, I mean, you can't just waltz back into my life, um, expecting me to, [angry], compromise my professional ethics because you're suddenly, [very quietly], concerned about some rich woman's kid. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Look, um, this kid reminds me of myself at fifteen, you know, before everything fell apart with, [regretful], dad and the family.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] What do you mean he reminds you of, [hesitantly], yourself, because last I checked you never, [coldly], tried to hurt yourself?

Character 2 [en]: [melancholic] There are different ways of self-destruction and mine was just, [slowly], more socially acceptable until it wasn't anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] You know, um, I've actually kept your graduation photo in my desk drawer, I mean, [nostalgic], from before everything changed between us.

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, like, I never wanted to disappoint you but, um, [ashamed], staying in touch meant facing your judgment about my choices, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] I mean, maybe I was too harsh back then, um, too focused on what mom would've thought instead of, [gently], understanding why you chose this path.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] She would've hated everything about my life now but at least I can, [proudly], afford to put flowers on her grave every week.

Character 1 [en]: [tearfully] You've been visiting her grave, I mean, all this time I thought you'd, um, [surprised], forgotten about her completely after the funeral.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Every Thursday at sunset, um, just like she used to love watching from the hospital window, you know, [shaky voice], before the cancer took that away too. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Fine, I'll see the kid tomorrow but this is about, [passionately], helping him not about us fixing whatever's been, [hopeful], broken between us for half a decade.

Character 2 [en]: Thank you for doing this even though I probably don't, [grateful], deserve your help after disappearing the way I did, [apologetic], without any explanation or goodbye.

Character 1 [en]: [cautiously] After we help this kid maybe we could grab coffee and you could, [nervously], tell me about your life beyond just, [whispering loudly], the professional aspects.

Character 2 [en]: [smiling speaking] I'd like that.
