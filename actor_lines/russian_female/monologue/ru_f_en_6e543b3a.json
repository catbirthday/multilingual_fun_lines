[slowly] And I just remember thinking, okay, all those years getting yelled at for not coiling lines fast enough, for not reading the water right—suddenly it all clicked. [confidently] I knew exactly how to time the approach with the swells. Knew to throw the line upwind so it would drift to them. [shaky voice] God, when the first guy went under for a second, I thought— [pause] But muscle memory, you know? It just takes over. Three years of practice drills, of Captain Mike making us do man-overboard exercises until we could do them blindfolded. [relieved] We got all three aboard, hypothermic but alive. [very quietly] Sometimes I still dream about what would've happened if I hadn't spent all those years as a deckhand. If I'd just been some, um... some weekend sailor playing hero. [emotional] Those guys went home to their families because I knew my job. [long pause] That's what matters."
