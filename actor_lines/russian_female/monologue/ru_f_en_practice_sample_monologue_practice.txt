Speaker [en]: [gasp softly] Did that just—did Marcus just actually shake my hand? I mean, [stuttering] h-he literally just looked me in the eye and said I deserved it. Marcus. The same guy who, um, spent the last three years trying to destroy me at every turn. [short pause] God, his hand was so cold. Or maybe mine was? I don't know, I'm still kind of [confused] processing this whole thing.

You know what's weird? [slowly] I thought I'd feel more... triumphant? Like, this is what I wanted, right? Him admitting I was better. [bitter] After all that sabotage, all those times he tried to undercut me, and now he's just—what, gracious in defeat? [laugh] That's rich. 

But honestly, [very quietly] the way his voice cracked a little when he said it... [pause] I mean, he looked genuinely broken. And here's the thing—I actually felt bad for him for like half a second. [frustrated] Which is insane! This is Marcus we're talking about! 

[sigh] Maybe that's what real victory feels like though, you know? Not the crushing your enemies part, but like... [hesitantly] seeing them as human afterward. God, when did I become so [trailing off] philosophical about this...
