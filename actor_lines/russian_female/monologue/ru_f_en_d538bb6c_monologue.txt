Speaker [en]: [bitter] Thirty years. I mean, thirty goddamn years I've been standing on that floor, and they just— [pause] they send us an email. Not even a, you know, a proper meeting or anything. Just this, um, corporate bullshit about "restructuring" and [mocking] "market conditions." [sigh] 

Six months. That's all I had left, honestly. Six more months and I'd have my full pension, my— [trailing off] I don't even know what I'm gonna... [frustrated] The smell of fish, it's like, it's in my clothes, my hair, under my fingernails. [chuckle] My wife always said I'd never lose that smell. Guess she was wrong about that, huh?

[exhausted] I keep thinking about my first day, right? Young and stupid, thought I'd just, ah, work there a couple years. [regretful] Save up some money, move on to something better. [long pause] 

[very quietly] Funny how a couple years turns into your whole damn life.
