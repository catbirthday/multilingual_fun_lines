Speaker [en]: [hesitantly] I've been meaning to tell you this for, um, weeks now but I just— [pause] I don't know how to even say it properly. [warmly] You probably don't realize this, but the way you just... listened to me during those awful months, [voice shaky] when everything with Mark was falling apart? [deep breath] God, I was such a mess. [laughing sadly] Remember when I'd come into your office and just, like, word-vomit about custody schedules? [grateful] You never once told me I was being annoying. [pause] Not once. [getting emotional] And that Tuesday when I completely broke down about the house— [voice cracking] you just handed me tissues and said "take your time." [sniffling] Nobody else did that for me, you know? [steadying] My own sister kept saying I needed to "move on already" but you, [very sincerely] you understood that grief isn't linear. [chuckle] I mean, you probably wanted to tell me to shut up sometimes. [pause] But honestly, having someone who didn't judge me for being angry one day and devastated the next? [warmly] That saved me. [emotional] It really, truly saved me. [clearing throat] So, um, thank you. [smiling speaking] Thank you for being exactly what I needed when I couldn't even ask for it.
