Speaker [en]: Look, I never thought being completely unremarkable would, you know, actually become my thing. [confused] But here I am, right? The spokesperson for, um, regular people's problems. [chuckle] They literally picked me because I'm so... average. My credit score? [monotone] 680. My car? Honda Civic. I mean, [hesitantly] I shop at Target, I forget to floss, and honestly, I still don't understand cryptocurrency. 

[bitter] "Perfectly average Jane," that's what they called me. Like, [pause] at first it kind of stung, you know? [upset] Nobody wants to be told they're basically the human equivalent of beige. But then I thought, well, [warming up] somebody has to speak for us, right? The people who, er, aren't influencers or CEOs or whatever. [passionately] We're the ones dealing with real stuff! Like, why do I need seventeen passwords? [frustrated] Why does my insurance cover everything except what I actually need? And honestly, [speeding up] don't even get me started on self-checkout machines that yell at you about unexpected items—

[sigh] The thing is, being average means I get it. [very sincerely] I really get what most people go through. So yeah, [confidently] maybe being unremarkable is actually my superpower. [laugh] God, that sounds ridiculous.
