Speaker [en]: [slowly] Okay, so... this valve, it's like—hmm, I mean, ninety years of oxidation here. [concentrated] The thing is, um, you can actually feel the history in these dents, you know? [short pause] Someone played Taps on this. [very quietly] Probably played it at, er, Normandy or—I don't know, maybe the Pacific. 

[animated] And honestly, when the grandson called me, right? He goes, [emotional] "It was my grandfather's, and we need it for Tuesday," and I'm thinking—[chuckle] well, that's in three days, but then he tells me what it's for. [pause] A memorial service. [very slowly] For the last surviving member of their unit.

[warm] So anyway, I've been working on this, like, sixteen hours straight now, and the valves are finally—[excited] oh God, listen to this! [relieved] That's it, that's actually—it's singing again. [sniffle] I mean, basically, instruments don't forget, you know? They just, um, they need someone to... [trailing off] to remember with them.

[shaky voice] Tomorrow, er, when they play Taps at that service, it won't just be any trumpet. [passionately] It'll be THIS trumpet, the one that was there, that survived when—[cry] when so many didn't. [very sincerely] And honestly, fixing this? It's probably the most important work I've ever done.
