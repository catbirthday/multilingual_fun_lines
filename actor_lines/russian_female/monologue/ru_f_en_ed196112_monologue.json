Five years clean, that's—that's incredible. She wants us all there, the whole family, fancy restaurant, the works. \n\n[anxious] And here I am counting quarters for gas money. Literally. Quarters. We got the foreclosure notice yesterday and I'm supposed to smile and—[frustrated] God, I sound like such a terrible person. She deserves this. She worked so hard, all those meetings, the rehab stays we all pitched in for... \n\n[crying while speaking] I remember when she hit rock bottom, we were doing okay then, we actually helped with her treatment costs. Now she's thriving, got promoted at work, and we can't even afford to keep our kids in soccer. [pause] The irony is just... \n\n[very quietly] I want to be there for her, I do. But how do I show up in my one decent outfit left, order water and appetizers, pretend everything's fine? [shaky voice] Maybe I tell her we're sick that day? No, that's—[regretful] she'd know. She always knows. \n\n[exhausted] I'm proud of her, um, I really am. It's just... timing, you know? Life's timing is so cruel sometimes."
