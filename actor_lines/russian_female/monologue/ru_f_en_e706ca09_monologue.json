Um, the state board said it was, like, the gold standard for archery technicians. [frustrated] So now they're telling me that, what, it's basically worthless? [sarcastic] Oh that's great, that's really fantastic. I mean, I turned down that job at the sporting goods store because, you know, I wanted to focus on getting certified properly. [bitter] And honestly, the amount of money I spent on those workshops— [groan] God, it was like three thousand dollars just for the compound bow module alone. [very quietly] I can't believe this is happening. Er, maybe there's some kind of grandfather clause or, I don't know, something where existing certifications still count? [anxious] The thing is, I already told my family I was starting my own shop next month. [laugh] This is so stupid. Like, how does a certification just stop being valid? [angry] They can't just change the rules after people have already— [trailing off] I mean... [sigh] Okay so, hmm, maybe I can transfer it to another state? [desperately hopeful] Actually wait, Minnesota might still recognize it, right? [mumbling] Or I could just, sort of, practice without the official— [pause] No, that's illegal. [very sad] I really thought this was my thing, you know?"
