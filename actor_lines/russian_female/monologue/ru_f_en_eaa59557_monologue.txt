Speaker [en]: [warm] God, you know, I remember those first few months after the wedding when Dave would come over and we'd just... sit there. Like, um, neither of us knew what to say. [chuckle] I mean, here's this guy whose daughter I married and we're both trying so hard to—honestly, it was painful. We'd watch TV and, er, make these weird comments about the weather. 

[animated] But then, okay so, remember when I mentioned I was building those shelves? He just lit up! Suddenly he's asking about, you know, what kind of joints I'm using, and I'm like—wait, [excited] you do woodworking too? 

That first time in his workshop though... [trailing off] I mean, the man had tools I'd only seen in catalogs. We spent, hmm, probably six hours just working on this simple jewelry box for Sarah. [smiling speaking] Barely talked at first, but it was different, you know? The awkwardness just... wasn't there anymore. 

[passionately] Now every Sunday we're out there covered in sawdust, arguing about whether dovetails or box joints are better—and honestly, it's like—[pause] I don't know, somewhere between teaching me about grain patterns and, uh, letting me borrow his good chisels, Dave became... [very sincerely] he became my friend. Not just my father-in-law. My actual friend.
