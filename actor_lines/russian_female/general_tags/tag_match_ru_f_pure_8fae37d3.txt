=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [удивлённо] Well, um, the motion sensors have been triggering at, [растерянно], odd hours according to the logs, so I mean, someone's definitely been here more than just twice a day to feed the cats.

Character 2 [pure]: [оборонительно] The Johnsons asked me to, [тихо], stay longer to make sure Princess doesn't get, [нервно], anxious—she has separation issues and needs, [затихая], constant attention.

Character 1 [pure]: Uh, that's interesting because, well, there's a sleeping bag in the guest room and, [внимательно], empty takeout containers in the trash, so um, you've been doing more than just, [осторожно], extended visits haven't you?

Character 2 [pure]: [застигнут врасплох] I can explain, I mean, it's not what you're, [в панике], thinking—my landlord evicted me last month and, um, the Johnsons said I could stay here if, [отчаянно], if there was ever an emergency with the pets, so well, this counts as an emergency. [вздыхает]

Character 1 [pure]: Look, um, I get it, I mean being between places is, [с сочувствием], rough, but er, you realize I have to report this to the security company and they'll definitely tell the homeowners, right?

Character 2 [pure]: [умоляюще] Please don't—I've been taking, [дрожащим голосом], perfect care of everything here, the plants are thriving, [лихорадочно], the cats are happy, and nothing's been touched except what I need for, [срывающимся голосом], basic survival.

Character 1 [pure]: [с сомнением] The cameras I'm installing today will, [неловко], record everything from now on anyway.

Character 2 [pure]: [смирившись] So, um, you're saying I have to leave, well, today then—after I've been here two months already taking, [пусто], care of their whole life while they're, [горько], living it up in Europe, and um, now I'm just supposed to go back to, [срывающийся], to nothing?

Character 1 [pure]: [тихо] Two months—jesus, you've been, [ошеломлённо], living here for two whole months without anyone, [обдумывая], knowing, and the Johnsons have no idea their pet sitter basically, [недоверчиво], moved in?

Character 2 [pure]: Well, they know I'm here every day, um, they just don't know it's, [пристыженно], every night too—I mean, what difference does it make if their pets are being loved and their house is secure?

Character 1 [pure]: [твёрдо] The difference is trust—they hired you for, [размеренно], a specific service, not to treat their home like, [прямо], a free Airbnb, regardless of your circumstances or how well you're, [строго], caring for things.

Character 2 [pure]: [отчаянно] Um, I haven't stolen anything or, well, damaged anything—I sleep on the floor most nights so I don't, [дрожа], mess up their perfect furniture, you know?

Character 1 [pure]: Er, that's actually worse somehow, um, sleeping on their floor like you're, [грустно], punishing yourself while still violating their space—I mean, can't you see how, [нежно], messed up this whole situation is?

Character 2 [pure]: What I see is someone who's never been, [горько], homeless judging someone who is. [пауза]

Character 1 [pure]: [смягчаясь] You don't know anything about what I've been through—but watching you, [сочувственно], rationalize this deception reminds me of when I used to, [уязвимо], justify my own bad choices after my divorce left me sleeping in my work van.

Character 2 [pure]: [удивлённо] Wait, you were, um, homeless too—then you know what it's like when, [с надеждой], when you're just trying to survive and, well, an opportunity presents itself that doesn't really hurt anyone but, [с сомнением], saves you from the street?

Character 1 [pure]: Yeah, I know exactly what it's like, which is why, um, I also know that once you start lying to yourself about what you're doing, well, it gets, [устало], harder and harder to find your way back to being someone trustworthy.

Character 2 [pure]: [подавленно] So what happens now—you call them, um, tell them everything, and I lose my job, er, my only income, and well, the only roof I have over my, [срывающимся голосом], head all in one phone call?

Character 1 [pure]: [решительно] What happens now is you pack your things while I, [твёрдо], install these cameras, and then we're going to, [размеренно], figure out a solution that doesn't involve more lies.

Character 2 [pure]: [осторожно] Um, what kind of solution—I mean, are you saying you won't, [неуверенно], tell them if I leave today, or, well, are you offering something else entirely?
