=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] These documents, um, well, they're authentic—seventeenth century parchment with, [amazed], original wax seals that I mean, haven't been broken in over three hundred years.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] So you're saying that, um, my grandmother's stories about, [overwhelmed], being descended from nobility weren't just, well, [voice breaking], fairy tales she told us when we couldn't afford, [whispering], groceries?

Character 1 [en]: The lineage is, um, unbroken—every generation documented with births, [careful], marriages, and I mean, deaths leading directly to you. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] But we lived in, well, a two-bedroom apartment where the heat, [bitter], got shut off every winter, so um, how could we be heirs to anything?

Character 1 [en]: [softly] We found it.

Character 2 [en]: The estate in Scotland has been held in, [incredulous], trust for two centuries waiting for someone to, [shaking], present these exact documents that your grandmother, [tearful], somehow kept hidden in that old music box.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] I've authenticated, well, thousands of historical claims but, [moved], this one, um, it's different because you never, [thoughtful], came looking for money—you just wanted to know if grandma's stories were real.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] She used to trace the, um, family crest on my hand with her finger when, [nostalgic], I couldn't sleep, and I mean, she'd whisper about castles and, [breaking], lands that belonged to our blood even though we had, well, nothing. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Your inheritance includes not just the, [serious], estate but also your great-great-grandfather's journals detailing how he, [reverent], helped enslaved people escape through Scotland to freedom.

Character 2 [en]: So we weren't just, um, nobility but actually, [proud], did something good with it?

Character 1 [en]: [passionate] The archives show your family liquidated most of their, [emphatic], wealth to fund escape routes, which is why the, [admiring], money disappeared but the land trust remained intact.

Character 2 [en]: Worth thirty-seven million pounds.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] The beautiful part is that, well, your grandmother knew but chose, [emotional], to let you grow up without the burden of wealth you couldn't access.

Character 2 [en]: [overwhelmed] She died last month still believing that, um, someday I'd find these papers in her, [choked], music box, and I mean, she made me promise to show them to a real historian. [cries softly]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] She knew exactly what she was, [certain], doing when she sent you to me.

Character 2 [en]: You were her, [realizing], history professor at the community college thirty years ago.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] She brought me these same documents then but asked me to, [heavy], wait until after she passed to authenticate them.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] You've known this whole time who, well, I really was and just, [hurt], watched me struggle through law school working three jobs while you, [accusatory], sat on proof that could have changed everything, I mean, everything?

Character 1 [en]: [firm] I kept a promise to a woman who wanted her granddaughter to, [proud], understand what it meant to earn something before, [meaningful], inheriting what was always meant to be yours. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [softly] She always said character had to be, [understanding], built from scratch, not handed down with silver spoons. [sighs deeply]
