=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitant] I know I shouldn't just show up here after all these years but Dad's, [breaking], clubs are still sitting in his garage and neither of us can decide what to do with them.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, um, you were always his favorite anyway, so I mean, why don't you just, [bitter], take them all and pretend like, [shaking], I never existed, just like you've been doing for the past five years.

Character 1 [en]: [sincere] That's not fair and you know it—I stayed away because you, [hurt], told me at Mom's funeral that seeing me was like, [trembling], watching Dad choose golf over family all over again and I couldn't, [voice cracking], bear to cause you more pain.

Character 2 [en]: [softening] Every morning when I knead the dough I still hear his voice, [wistful], telling me that precision matters whether you're, [careful], fitting clubs or measuring flour, and now those clubs are all that's, [breaking], left of him.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] I miss him too.

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, um, I actually kept his favorite putter hidden in, [protective], my apartment because I couldn't stand the thought of you, [vulnerable], taking everything that mattered to him. [sighs deeply]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You kept his Scotty Cameron—the one he, [touched], won the club championship with three years running?

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Sometimes I hold it while the bread rises and pretend he's, [yearning], still here telling me stories about, [nostalgic], every scratch and dent on that old club head.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] Um, you know, he actually had me refit that putter six times because, well, he said it had to be, [tender], perfect for when he taught you to play, but, umm, you never wanted to learn. 

Character 2 [en]: He asked?

Character 1 [en]: Every single Sunday for fifteen years he'd come into my shop and, [aching], practice his putting stroke while planning how to convince you to join us. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: I thought, um, I mean, he only invited me out of obligation because, [struggling], you two had your whole golf thing and I was just the daughter who, [resigned], chose flour over fairways, you know, the one who disappointed him. [voice breaks]

Character 1 [en]: [firm] He kept a photo of your first wedding cake in his golf bag next to, [proud], his scorecards and told everyone at the club that his daughter was, [beaming], an artist who could make flour sing the way, [loving], he made golf balls dance. [laughs softly]

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] Maybe we could display some of his clubs here in the bakery alongside, [hopeful], Mom's old recipe cards and create a little memorial that, [thoughtful], honors both of them and everything they gave us. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I could build custom mounts for them, and, umm, maybe teach you what each club meant to him, you know, tell you the, [tender], stories behind every grip he wore smooth with practice.

Character 2 [en]: And maybe, um, well, I could finally learn to hold that putter properly while you, [vulnerable], try my sourdough starter that I named after Dad. [chuckles sadly]

Character 1 [en]: [resolute] He would have loved knowing we're finally doing this, [hopeful], together.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] God, I've missed having a brother who understands that grief tastes like, [raw], metal and flour and freshly cut grass all, [breaking], mixed together.

Character 1 [en]: The shop feels empty without him asking me to check his, [heavy], stance one more time, and this bakery smells exactly like, [remembering], Mom's kitchen on Sunday mornings when we were kids before everything got so, [wistful], complicated between us all.

Character 2 [en]: Let's go get his clubs and bring them, [determined], home where they belong, here with the, [peaceful], rest of our family's broken beautiful history. [exhales slowly]
