=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [withdrawn] My lawyers tell me you've been digging through the, [cold], archives at Somerset House looking for dirt on my family.

Character 2 [en]: [calm] Just doing research.

Character 1 [en]: [tense] Well, um, I don't think you, [strained], understand what you're dealing with here, er, the documents you've found are, [threatening], incomplete and misleading, I mean, taken completely out of historical context.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] Um, they're pretty clear. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: My family has supported this university for, [bitter], three centuries with endowments and scholarships, and this is how, [incredulous], you repay that generosity?

Character 2 [en]: [informed] Actually, um, those endowments were, [careful], funded directly from sugar plantations in Jamaica that, well, your ancestors operated using, [measured], enslaved labor from 1742 to 1834, I mean, the ledgers are quite specific.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Every noble family in England has, [uncomfortable], complex histories that modern sensibilities might, [trailing off], find troubling but that doesn't mean we should— [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Um, it does though. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: Look, um, my political campaign is about, [desperate], moving forward, not, er, relitigating centuries-old grievances that have nothing to do with, I mean, who I am today.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Well, um, your great-great-grandfather's journals that you, [steady], donated to our library actually helped me, er, understand the full scope of what, [emotional], happened to those 847 people your family owned, so, you know, thank you for that.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] I didn't donate those journals for you to, um, weaponize them against me, I mean, against my campaign. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: Um, the truth isn't a weapon, it's just, [patient], the truth, and, well, those people deserve to have their, [reverent], stories told after being silenced for, I mean, nearly two hundred years. [quietly]

Character 1 [en]: You realize that, um, publishing this will, [hollow], destroy everything I've worked for, er, my entire platform about, [breaking], economic reform and social progress, well, it'll all be overshadowed by this.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Maybe that's because, um, real social progress means, [firm], confronting uncomfortable truths about how, well, wealth and power were, [determined], actually accumulated in this country, you know? [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [withdrawn] The university administration will hear about this, [threatening], and your thesis advisor Professor Hartley is an old family friend who understands, [calculated], discretion.

Character 2 [en]: [informed] Professor Hartley already reviewed my research and, [proud], signed off on it because the documentation is, [confident], irrefutable and academically significant.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, what exactly do you want from me, I mean, money to, [disgusted], keep quiet, or just the, well, satisfaction of ruining someone?

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Nothing, actually, because your donation gave me, [sincere], everything I needed to tell their stories properly and that's, [peaceful], all I ever wanted. [softly]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Well, um, then I suppose we have, [resigned], nothing left to discuss, er, except how quickly my life unravels.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Um, actually, well, no.
