=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Your name is on my witness list for the, [swallowing hard], Corporal Martinez case and I need to know why you were at the barracks that night when, [carefully], three people ended up dead.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, um, I was just there for a party, I mean, like I always am, [shifting uncomfortably], nothing more than drinks and dancing.

Character 1 [en]: [firm] This isn't one of your, [frustrated], club stories where you can just, well, charm your way out because, [lowering voice], um, there's video footage of you leaving fifteen minutes before the, [pained], first emergency call.

Character 2 [en]: Jesus, umm, you're really going to interrogate me like I'm, [breaking], one of your clients, aren't you, I mean, your own sibling? [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: No, I'm trying to protect you because, umm, the prosecutor thinks you supplied the, [whispering], drugs that killed them, and well, I need the truth. [exhales slowly]

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] I didn't know the pills were laced, okay, I mean, um, they were just supposed to be, [trembling], party favors like always.

Character 1 [en]: [horrified] Party favors—Christ, do you even, um, hear yourself right now because those, [voice cracking], were barely adults who trusted someone at that party and now, well, they're being shipped home in, [barely audible], flag-draped coffins. [chokes up]

Character 2 [en]: You think I don't see their faces every time I, [haunted], close my eyes or that I haven't been, [shaking], sober for the first time in years because I can't, [hoarse], drink this away?

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] Being sober doesn't bring them back but, [steady], testifying truthfully might save the ones who, [urgent], survived from taking the fall for something bigger than a party gone wrong.

Character 2 [en]: [withdrawn] The dealer was military, [quieter], someone high up who's been running parties for, [hollow], years.

Character 1 [en]: Give me a name because, um, without it, you're looking at, [grim], accessory to manslaughter at minimum and I can't, well, I mean, [cracking], defend you if you won't defend yourself. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [scared] Lieutenant Colonel Harrison, um, your commanding officer's golf buddy who, [whispering], supplies half the base. [trembles]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Harrison—the same one who's been, [disbelieving], pushing for my client's dishonorable discharge, I mean, um, of course he'd want someone else to, [angry], take the fall for his operation.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] So what happens to me now, umm, because I can't exactly, [fearful], go back to my apartment knowing what I just told you.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] You're going into protective custody tonight and, um, tomorrow you're giving a sworn deposition that's going to, [fierce], burn down Harrison's whole network, well, even if it means I never try another case on this base.

Character 2 [en]: You'd really risk your career for me after all the times I've, [guilty], disappointed you and embarrassed the family? [voice breaks]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] You're my little sibling and despite everything, [tender], I never stopped hoping you'd find your way back from whatever darkness you've been, [emotional], dancing in all these years.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] I'm so tired of running from this, um, from myself, and I mean, maybe testifying is, [hopeful], the first real thing I've done that matters. [sniffles]

Character 1 [en]: It matters more than you, [earnest], know right now.

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] Then let's burn it all down together, um, because those kids deserve, [fierce], justice and maybe, well, I mean, [vulnerable], maybe I deserve a chance to be more than just the family, [breaking], disappointment. [deep breath]
