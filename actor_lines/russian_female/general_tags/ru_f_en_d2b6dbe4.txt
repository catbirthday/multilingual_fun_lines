=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Three shipments gone. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [cold] You've been hitting my supply routes for, [calculating], months without even knowing who you were, [amused], stealing from, and now you come here asking for, [incredulous], what exactly?

Character 1 [en]: Look, um, I didn't know those were your operations, I mean, [frustrated], how was I supposed to know you'd expanded that far north, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, ignorance. [laughs darkly]

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Listen, uh, we've been sabotaging each other without realizing it, so, [tense], maybe it's time we consider that, um, [careful], the enemy of our enemy could be useful, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [intrigued] The corporate security forces have been, [thoughtful], getting more aggressive lately, their new predictive algorithms are, [annoyed], cutting into both our profits, and that's, [bitter], bad for business all around.

Character 1 [en]: [leaning forward] So, um, what if we coordinate, I mean, [conspiratorial], share intel about their patrol patterns and, well, [eager], split territories instead of stepping on each other's operations, you know?

Character 2 [en]: Trust is not something I, um, [skeptical], give freely, especially to someone who's cost me, er, [calculating], roughly three million in lost merchandise, and, well, [harsh], reputation is everything in my world, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Your reputation won't mean much when they finally, [serious], crack your distribution network using the data they're gathering from our conflicts.

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, you've been watching them too, I mean, [surprised], closer than I thought, er, which makes you either very smart or, um, very dangerous.

Character 1 [en]: [confident] Both, actually, which is exactly why this, [intense], partnership would work.

Character 2 [en]: [contemplative] Tell me about, um, [curious], their new scanning tech at the port, I mean, the one that caught your crew last week, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [grimacing] They're using thermal imaging combined with, [angry], AI pattern recognition that learns from every, [bitter], failed run we make, and it's getting, [worried], smarter every damn day. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [impressed] You lost good people but still managed to, [calculating], extract that level of technical detail, which suggests you have, [intrigued], someone on the inside.

Character 1 [en]: [evasive] Everyone has their price, even corporate security, [knowing], drones who think they're saving the world from people, [mocking], like us, when really they're just protecting, [bitter], profit margins. [scoffs]

Character 2 [en]: [decisive] Fine, we'll try this, um, arrangement for one month, but, well, [warning], if you cross me or, er, compromise my operations, you know what happens.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] Same rules apply to you, [firm], because I didn't survive this long by, [hard], trusting villains with pretty words.

Character 2 [en]: [amused] Pretty words from someone who just, [dry], pitched me an alliance based entirely on mutual desperation.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, desperation works.

Character 2 [en]: [final] We'll see.
