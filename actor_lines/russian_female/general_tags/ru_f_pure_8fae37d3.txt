=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [pure]: [surprised] Well, um, the motion sensors have been triggering at, [confused], odd hours according to the logs, so I mean, someone's definitely been here more than just twice a day to feed the cats.

Character 2 [pure]: [defensive] The Johnsons asked me to, [quiet], stay longer to make sure Princess doesn't get, [nervous], anxious—she has separation issues and needs, [trailing off], constant attention.

Character 1 [pure]: Uh, that's interesting because, well, there's a sleeping bag in the guest room and, [observant], empty takeout containers in the trash, so um, you've been doing more than just, [careful], extended visits haven't you?

Character 2 [pure]: [caught] I can explain, I mean, it's not what you're, [panicking], thinking—my landlord evicted me last month and, um, the Johnsons said I could stay here if, [desperate], if there was ever an emergency with the pets, so well, this counts as an emergency. [sighs]

Character 1 [pure]: Look, um, I get it, I mean being between places is, [sympathetic], rough, but er, you realize I have to report this to the security company and they'll definitely tell the homeowners, right?

Character 2 [pure]: [pleading] Please don't—I've been taking, [trembling], perfect care of everything here, the plants are thriving, [frantic], the cats are happy, and nothing's been touched except what I need for, [voice cracking], basic survival.

Character 1 [pure]: [conflicted] The cameras I'm installing today will, [uncomfortable], record everything from now on anyway.

Character 2 [pure]: [resigned] So, um, you're saying I have to leave, well, today then—after I've been here two months already taking, [hollow], care of their whole life while they're, [bitter], living it up in Europe, and um, now I'm just supposed to go back to, [breaking], to nothing?

Character 1 [pure]: [quietly] Two months—jesus, you've been, [stunned], living here for two whole months without anyone, [processing], knowing, and the Johnsons have no idea their pet sitter basically, [disbelief], moved in?

Character 2 [pure]: Well, they know I'm here every day, um, they just don't know it's, [ashamed], every night too—I mean, what difference does it make if their pets are being loved and their house is secure?

Character 1 [pure]: [firm] The difference is trust—they hired you for, [measured], a specific service, not to treat their home like, [direct], a free Airbnb, regardless of your circumstances or how well you're, [stern], caring for things.

Character 2 [pure]: [desperate] Um, I haven't stolen anything or, well, damaged anything—I sleep on the floor most nights so I don't, [shaking], mess up their perfect furniture, you know?

Character 1 [pure]: Er, that's actually worse somehow, um, sleeping on their floor like you're, [sad], punishing yourself while still violating their space—I mean, can't you see how, [gentle], messed up this whole situation is?

Character 2 [pure]: What I see is someone who's never been, [bitter], homeless judging someone who is. [pause]

Character 1 [pure]: [softening] You don't know anything about what I've been through—but watching you, [empathetic], rationalize this deception reminds me of when I used to, [vulnerable], justify my own bad choices after my divorce left me sleeping in my work van.

Character 2 [pure]: [surprised] Wait, you were, um, homeless too—then you know what it's like when, [hopeful], when you're just trying to survive and, well, an opportunity presents itself that doesn't really hurt anyone but, [conflicted], saves you from the street?

Character 1 [pure]: Yeah, I know exactly what it's like, which is why, um, I also know that once you start lying to yourself about what you're doing, well, it gets, [weary], harder and harder to find your way back to being someone trustworthy.

Character 2 [pure]: [defeated] So what happens now—you call them, um, tell them everything, and I lose my job, er, my only income, and well, the only roof I have over my, [voice cracking], head all in one phone call?

Character 1 [pure]: [decisive] What happens now is you pack your things while I, [firm], install these cameras, and then we're going to, [measured], figure out a solution that doesn't involve more lies.

Character 2 [pure]: [cautious] Um, what kind of solution—I mean, are you saying you won't, [uncertain], tell them if I leave today, or, well, are you offering something else entirely?
