=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I'm sorry, um, this might sound strange but I think you have, [shocked], my grandmother's journal there, I mean, the one with the leather binding and, well, her initials carved into the corner.

Character 2 [en]: Um, well, impossible. [defensive]

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] That's definitely her handwriting on the spine, [desperate], the way she curved her letters and marked every book she owned with that tiny, [nostalgic], star symbol in the corner.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Listen, um, a woman brought this in last week claiming, [suspicious], it belonged to her mother and needed restoration before the pages, [gentle], completely fell apart. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] She's been dead.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Dead for how long because, um, the woman who brought this seemed to know, [wandering], every story in these pages, I mean, like she'd lived them herself.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Three years this November and nobody else in our family, [breaking], would care enough about her writings to preserve them.

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] The woman had your eyes though, [observant], same shade of green with those gold flecks that catch the light when you're, [careful], emotional about something.

Character 1 [en]: That's, um, not possible because I'm an only child and my mother, [hollow], died when I was twelve, well, long before grandmother started writing in these journals.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] Sometimes families have secrets that only, [mysterious], surface when someone's gone and their belongings start, [knowing], finding their way to unexpected places.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Look, I don't know what kind of, um, old-fashioned mysticism you're peddling here but I need, [desperate], that journal back because it's all I have left of her stories, I mean, her recipes and memories.

Character 2 [en]: [steady] These pages describe a distribution engineer who, [tender], mapped water systems across three states and wrote love letters in the margins about someone who, [wistful], never wrote back. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] That's my grandfather's profession but, um, grandmother always said he died before, [confused], I was born, I mean, in some accident overseas.

Character 2 [en]: The woman who brought this looked, [haunted], maybe sixty years old with hands that trembled when she touched these pages like they were, [reverent], holy scripture she'd been searching for her whole, [broken], life.

Character 1 [en]: My grandmother never mentioned having, [lost], another child before my father and he certainly never spoke about, [wounded], any siblings. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [soft] She paid in advance for the restoration and left this address where she said someone would, [meaningful], eventually come looking for answers they weren't ready to, [prophetic], hear. [silence]

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] That's my grandmother's old house where nobody's lived for, [hollow], three years since we sold it to developers who are tearing it down next month.

Character 2 [en]: [mysterious] Well, um, she said she'd be waiting there every Tuesday at, [deliberate], sunset with tea and explanations for whoever was brave enough to, [beckoning], knock on that door she claimed still had her name on the mailbox. [whispers]

Character 1 [en]: [terrified] Today is Tuesday and the sun sets in, [checking watch], twenty minutes.

Character 2 [en]: [knowing] Then perhaps you should take this journal and find out if some stories, [eternal], deserve a different ending. [smiles sadly]
