=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Your hands are so familiar, the way they, [breaking], adjust the fabric like you've done this a thousand times before.

Character 2 [en]: [clinical] The hemline needs to be precisely, [measured], fourteen inches from the floor for royal protocol.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] You're not even going to look at me, just, [bitter], pretending I'm another mannequin to dress?

Character 2 [en]: [cold] My job is to ensure you look appropriate for, [exact], marrying into the royal family. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Twenty-three years ago, um, you left me at that orphanage with, [shaking], nothing but a note saying you'd come back, and I mean, [hollow], you never did until, [cracking], now. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: The sleeve length, well, requires adjustment by, [precise], three-quarters of an inch, and um, the bodice needs, [steady], restructuring to meet court standards, so, [detached], please remain still.

Character 1 [en]: [explosive] I spent my whole childhood wondering why my own, [furious], mother couldn't love me enough to stay! [sobs]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Um, well, I—

Character 1 [en]: [volatile] Every birthday I waited by that orphanage window thinking maybe, [haunted], today would be the day you'd finally remember I existed.

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] I mean, um, please—

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Well, um, say something. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [cracking] I've dressed, um, hundreds of brides but, [trembling], watching you transform into royalty when I, well, couldn't even give you, [breaking], proper shoes as a child is—

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] So you do remember leaving me barefoot in, um, I mean, January snow because we couldn't afford anything.

Character 2 [en]: [anguished] Every measurement I take, um, reminds me of, [shattered], how small you were when I, well, walked away believing you'd have, [choking], a better life without me, I mean, without my failures.

Character 1 [en]: The orphanage matron said my mother was, [bitter], probably dead or in prison, never imagining she'd become, [incredulous], supervisor of the royal wardrobes.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I clawed my way from, [fierce], nothing to this position through twenty years of, [proud], perfect work never making a single, [exact], mistake except the one that mattered most. [cries softly]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] The prince, um, doesn't know about you, and I mean, [vulnerable], I don't know if I can walk down that aisle with, [breaking], this secret between us.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Your train needs to be carried by, [mechanical], six attendants according to tradition. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Just once, call me by my name instead of, [desperate], 'miss' or 'your highness-to-be' like I'm not the, [whispered], daughter you abandoned.

Character 2 [en]: [sobbing] Elizabeth, my beautiful, [overwhelmed], Elizabeth, you look exactly like, [tender], I always dreamed you would, [breaking], standing here in white lace. [collapses]
