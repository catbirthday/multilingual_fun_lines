=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [composed] Well, um, this fog is rather, [dismissive], inconvenient for sailing, though I suppose you're, [amused], here to lecture me about maritime safety regulations, er, as if I haven't been navigating these waters since before you were born.

Character 2 [en]: [knowing] I've been watching your yacht make these, [deliberate], midnight runs through this channel for three months now, and the fog, [measured], always seems to roll in just when you're passing through the, [pointed], restricted zones.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Um, I don't know what you're—

Character 2 [en]: [interrupting] The Bellefonte's hull modifications aren't for, [careful], stability in rough seas, they're for carrying extra cargo that doesn't, [direct], appear on any manifest. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Um, you're suggesting something rather, [indignant], serious about a family vessel that's been in our, [trembling], possession for generations, and I, well, I find these accusations, [cold], deeply offensive.

Character 2 [en]: [steady] Your great-grandfather ran rum during Prohibition using the, [historical], same hidden compartments, your father ran guns to Cuba in the, [knowing], sixties, and now here you are, [accusatory], continuing the family tradition.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, even if your, [bitter], wild theories were true, you'd need proof, er, which you clearly don't have.

Character 2 [en]: [confident] The proof is currently being documented by my team who boarded your, [satisfied], yacht fifteen minutes ago while you were, [calculated], distracted by our conversation here on this, [gesturing], conveniently foggy pier.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Um, you can't just, well, board private property without a warrant, that's, [desperate], completely illegal, I mean my lawyers will, [threatening], destroy you in court. [laughs nervously]

Character 2 [en]: [calm] Maritime law gives us authority to board any vessel that's, [legal], run aground in protected waters, especially when there's, [emphatic], reasonable suspicion of smuggling activity.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] My family has owned these waters longer than your, [nostalgic], coast guard has existed, back when honor meant something and, [melancholic], a person's word was their bond.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, honor doesn't mean much when you're moving, [disgusted], fentanyl through fishing villages where kids are, I mean, dying every week.

Character 1 [en]: Fentanyl is a, [shocked], completely absurd accusation. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [grim] We found the vacuum-sealed packages hidden in your, [precise], modified ballast tanks. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [broken] Um, I didn't know what they were moving through my boat, I mean, they just paid me to, [desperate], look the other way during these fog runs, and, well, I needed the money after the estate taxes nearly, [defeated], ruined us.

Character 2 [en]: [weary] Um, the fog's lifting now and you can see the, [pointing], patrol boats surrounding your yacht, so I mean, [sympathetic], your family's smuggling legacy ends tonight, one way or, [final], another. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [quiet] The fog always, [philosophical], lifts eventually.

Character 2 [en]: [matter-of-fact] It always does, [reflective], and what's hidden in the darkness becomes clear in the, [solemn], light. [footsteps approaching]

Character 1 [en]: Tell them I'll cooperate.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] That's wise.
