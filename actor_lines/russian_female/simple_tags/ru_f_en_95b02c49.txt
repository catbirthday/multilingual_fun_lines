=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Marcus, what the hell are you, [cold], doing here at the Ritz Carlton at midnight on a Tuesday?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I could ask you the same question since you're supposed to be, [exhausted], at that medical conference in Boston right now.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Flight got cancelled. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Look, um, I need you to just, [hesitantly], walk away and pretend you never saw me here because, well, this isn't what it, [trembling], looks like and I mean, I can't explain right now.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, I think it's exactly what it, er, looks like.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Well, your sister doesn't know about this and, umm, she can never find out, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You're wearing a thousand dollar suit that you couldn't, [confused], afford last month when you borrowed rent money from us, and now you're, [frustrated], meeting someone at the most expensive hotel in the city? [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] The suit was a gift from a client who wanted me to look, [formal], appropriate for certain social events.

Character 1 [en]: So you're really doing this then, [disgusted], selling yourself to strangers while my sister thinks you're, [shaky voice], working night shifts at the warehouse?

Character 2 [en]: [tired] Um, the warehouse laid me off three months ago and, well, [desperate], nobody's hiring former addicts with criminal records, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Jesus, Marcus, um, why didn't you just, [regretful], tell us you lost your job, I mean, we could have helped you figure something out?

Character 2 [en]: Because, umm, Sarah's already ashamed enough of me without, [crying while speaking], knowing that I'm doing this just to keep our kids in their school and, well, [bored], pay for her mother's cancer treatments, you know? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] There had to be another way than, [apologetic], this Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] Name one job that pays eight hundred dollars for three hours of work that, um, doesn't require a degree or, [mocking], a clean background check, I mean really. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: You're destroying yourself and eventually it's going to, [worried], destroy her too. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I'm already destroyed.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Look, um, I won't tell Sarah but, [passionately], this has to stop, you know? [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] My last client cancelled which is why I'm standing here alone, [sad], but tomorrow there's a regular who pays my rent for the month in one, [very melancholic], night and I can't afford to say no.

Character 1 [en]: Then let me loan you the money because watching you, [angry], do this to yourself is worse than any, [pleading], debt you could ever owe me. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering loudly] You don't understand what it's like to fail everyone you, [slowly], love every single day.
