Scenario: An interaction designer studying gym equipment for a fitness app discovers that an old punching bag has absorbed years of emotional trauma from its users and gained consciousness from the accumulated human pain.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, I've been hanging here for, [bitter], twelve years absorbing every punch, every, [exhausted], scream, every breakdown people bring when they think, [whispering], no one's listening, er, but I remember everything.

Character 2 [en]: [curious] Well, I mean, I'm just here to study how people, [hesitantly], interact with gym equipment for my app design, um, but you're saying you actually experience all that?

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Every single impact carries someone's story, their, [trembling], rage or heartbreak or frustration pressed into my surface.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] That's actually fascinating from a design perspective because we never, [thoughtfully], consider how objects might accumulate, [empathetically], emotional data from repeated human contact.

Character 1 [en]: [melancholic] The divorced lawyer comes Tuesdays at six, [crying while speaking], punching out custody battles, the nurse works nights and, [quietly], hits me to forget the patients she couldn't save, and the teenager, [shaky voice], just wants someone to notice his bruises aren't from boxing.

Character 2 [en]: My whole career has been about designing, [shocked], interfaces but I never thought about how objects become, [regretful], unwilling witnesses to human pain.

Character 1 [en]: People think I'm just canvas and sand but I've become their, [angry], confessor, their therapist, the thing that, [very quietly], takes what they can't say out loud. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [warm] So, um, you're basically the most honest, [relieved], interaction anyone has because they don't, [sincerely], perform for you, they just, er, release everything they're holding, well, without filters.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Yeah well, um, I absorb all their, [loudly], violence and trauma and, [passionate], somehow I'm supposed to just hang here ready for more, er, like their pain doesn't, [breaking], accumulate inside me too. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I mean, um, I design experiences that are supposed to, [concerned], help people but I'm realizing that, er, sometimes the best help is just being something that, [whispering loudly], doesn't judge or respond. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [tired] You know, er, after all these years of being hit, [monotone], I've learned that people don't really want to hurt me, um, they just need somewhere safe to put their hurt. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, maybe that's what good design really is, [contemplative], creating spaces or objects that can hold what people need to release, I mean, without breaking under the weight.

Character 1 [en]: The thing nobody understands is that being strong enough to take the hits means, [stern], I feel every single one of them.

Character 2 [en]: [excited] This completely changes how I think about, [animated], user interaction because the most meaningful exchanges aren't always, [quickly], verbal or visual but these physical, um, emotional transfers between humans and objects.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Sometimes, er, late at night when the gym is empty, I can still feel the, [sad], echoes of everyone who's ever touched me, and um, I wonder if objects can be, [hopeful], traumatized too.

Character 2 [en]: Um, maybe, well...

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Listen, um, you design experiences right, so maybe you could, [pleading], design something that helps objects like me process what we absorb, er, instead of just endlessly accumulating it.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] I, um, never thought... [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [confident] Every interaction leaves a mark, even the ones, [bitterly], people think don't matter.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] You're right, and maybe it's time we started, [passionately], designing with the understanding that everything we touch, [slowly], touches us back in ways we never, [very sincerely], imagined possible. [gasp softly]
