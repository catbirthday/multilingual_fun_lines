Scenario: A twelve-year-old prodigy who solved an 'unsolvable' physics equation online meets the physicist whose life's work was just invalidated by their solution.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervously] So you're the one who wrote that paper about quantum entanglement and temporal displacement that everyone said was impossible to prove. [pause] I didn't mean to mess everything up for you, I was just playing around with the numbers because they looked fun.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Twenty-seven years of my life went into that theorem, and you solved it on a Saturday afternoon for fun. [long pause] How old are you exactly, if you don't mind me asking?

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Twelve, but I'll be thirteen next month. [quickly] My mom says I shouldn't tell strangers my age online but I guess we're not online anymore and you seem nice even though you look kind of sad right now.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Sad isn't quite the word I'd use for watching my entire academic reputation crumble because a child thought my life's work looked [sighs] fun to play with on the weekend.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] I said I was sorry like a million times in my emails! [shaky voice] Everyone keeps acting like I did something wrong but all I did was solve a problem that was sitting there asking to be solved.

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] You're right, you didn't do anything wrong. [empathetically] In fact, what you did was extraordinary, it's just difficult for me to process that everything I believed about the limitations of our understanding was completely incorrect.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] But isn't that exciting though? [animated] Like, now you can build on what I found and go even further, maybe discover something that'll blow everyone's minds even more than my solution did.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] You know, when I was your age, I used to sneak into university lectures because I was desperate to understand how the universe worked. [chuckles] Never imagined I'd be on the other side of this conversation one day.

Character 1 [en]: [excited] Wait, really?

Character 2 [en]: My parents thought I was at soccer practice but I was actually sitting in the back of Professor Chen's quantum mechanics class, understanding maybe [laughs] ten percent on a good day.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] I get it.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] You get what?

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] The loneliness of seeing things other people can't see yet. [pause] My classmates think I'm weird because I get excited about eigenvalues and nobody wants to sit with me at lunch anymore since I corrected our teacher about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Listen to me, that loneliness is temporary but your gift is permanent. [firmly] The world needs minds like yours, even if it means people like me have to swallow our pride and admit we were wrong.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Do you think I could maybe ask you questions sometimes? [quickly] Not about homework or anything, just about the really hard stuff that I can't figure out on my own, because there's this thing about dark matter that's been bothering me.

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] Dark matter? [laughs] Of course that's what's keeping you up at night. [warmly] Yes, you can email me anytime, though I suspect you'll be teaching me more than I teach you before long.

Character 1 [en]: [very excited] Really? [speeding up] Because I have this theory about how dark matter might not actually be matter at all but more like traces of parallel dimensions bleeding through and I made a model but I don't know if the math is right!

Character 2 [en]: [playful] Parallel dimensions bleeding through? [exhales] You just invalidated three decades of my research and now you want to tackle the biggest mystery in cosmology? [warmly] Show me your model, let's see what you've got.

Character 1 [en]: It's all in this notebook but my handwriting is terrible because I write too fast when I'm thinking and [nervous laugh] sometimes I switch between equations and doodles of cats because they help me concentrate.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] The best physicists I know have terrible handwriting and at least one of them doodles dinosaurs in the margins. [pause] May I see your notebook? I promise to take your cat-decorated theories very seriously.
