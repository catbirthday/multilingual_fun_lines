=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [breathless] Marcus, thank God you're still here because I've been, [rushing], calling you for three hours and the studio needs an answer by midnight.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] You have exactly thirty seconds to explain why you're, [cold], standing on my doorstep after six months of radio silence.

Character 1 [en]: [frantic] Well, um, Harrison just walked off the Kingsley film, like, literally drove away from set this morning and, [desperately], the director specifically asked for you, er, said you were always his first, [trembling], choice.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Um, you're telling me that, [confused], after they humiliated me in that callback, well, made me wait eight hours just to say, [angry], they went with someone younger, and now they want me to, er, [sarcastic], save their production?

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Listen, the contract is already drafted with, [excited], double Harrison's fee plus backend points. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [laughing bitterly] They rejected me for being too intense, [frustrated], too method, and now suddenly those same qualities are what they, [quietly], desperately need.

Character 1 [en]: The truth is they made a, [regretful], mistake choosing Harrison over you, but pride kept them from admitting it until, [shaky voice], everything fell apart and now they're, [anxious], begging for you to come back. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [cynical] Six months ago I would have, [passionate], killed for this opportunity.

Character 1 [en]: [urgent] Marcus, this role could completely redefine your career and put you, [empathetically], exactly where you deserve to be.

Character 2 [en]: [contemplative] You know what destroyed me wasn't losing the part but watching them, [hurt], celebrate choosing him while I was still, [whispering], standing right there in the room. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [warm] They're offering you creative control over your character arc, [sincerely], script approval, and your choice of, [enthusiastic], dialogue coach which means everything you asked for originally.

Character 2 [en]: [suspicious] Why should I trust anything, [nervously], they promise when they already proved my talent meant, [dismissive], nothing compared to a younger face?

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Um, because this time, well, they need you more than you need them and, er, [confidently], we both know you were born to play this role, I mean, [loudly], everyone who saw your audition knows it.

Character 2 [en]: [wavering] The character deserves better than being someone's, [melancholic], second choice even if that someone, [hesitantly], happens to be me.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You were never second choice to anyone who, [passionately], actually understood acting, Marcus, and the director fought for you, [exhausted], until the producers overruled him for Harrison's, [disgusted], Instagram following.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Stop trying to manipulate me with, [tired], compliments that should have mattered six months ago.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Please, Marcus, this isn't just about the film anymore because if you, [vulnerable], walk away from this, you're walking away from, [emotionally], everything we worked ten years to build, [breaking], together.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Well, um, I suppose there's poetic justice in, [thoughtful], them crawling back, er, but I need to read the revised script first and, like, [calculated], make them wait until eleven fifty-nine for my answer. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] That's the Marcus I remember, the one who, [proudly], always knew his worth even when, [hopeful], the industry tried to convince him otherwise.

Character 2 [en]: Fine, send me the contracts but they're, [determined], going to pay for every minute of those six months of, [vindicated], doubt they put me through, and this time, [slow], I'm keeping the costumes. [laugh]
