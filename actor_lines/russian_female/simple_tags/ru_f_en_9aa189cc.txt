Scenario: A hazmat driver arrives at the zoo after a chemical transport accident nearby releases toxic fumes, finding the head zookeeper who refuses to evacuate without ensuring all the animals are safe first.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stern] The chlorine gas cloud is moving this way and we've got, [urgently], maybe fifteen minutes before this entire area becomes, [loudly], a death trap so you need to evacuate immediately.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] I can't just abandon three hundred animals to, [shaky voice], die from toxic exposure while I save myself.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Listen, I've been doing hazmat response for twelve years and when I say, [firmly], evacuate, it means people are going to, [very quietly], die if they don't move right now.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Well, um, the primates are still in their night enclosures and, er, the reptile house ventilation system will, you know, pull those fumes straight into their habitat within minutes.

Character 1 [en]: Your safety protocols should have included, [coldly], emergency animal evacuation procedures but right now my job is saving, [empathetically], human lives first.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] These animals trust me to protect them and I've raised, [passionately], some of them from birth, watching them grow, [trembling], knowing they depend on me completely.

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] Look, I understand the attachment but the wind is shifting and if you're still here when, [anxiously], that cloud hits, your animals will watch you, [whispering], die trying to save them.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Um, you know, I've already lost two endangered snow leopards to, well, budget cuts last year and I mean, [defeated], I can't lose anyone else, not like this.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Fine, we've got emergency respirators in the truck but, [quickly], you get five minutes maximum.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Well, um, thank you, I mean, I just need to, er, get the baby orangutan and seal the ventilation systems.

Character 1 [en]: [commanding] I'm coming with you because if you pass out from exposure, [grimly], I'll need to drag you out myself while there's still, [pause], time to escape.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] The emergency shut-off valves are in the basement but the, [worried], generator failed last week so we'll be working in darkness with just, [nervously], flashlights to guide us through.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Well, um, I've got headlamps and, you know, portable oxygen but we're burning time here.

Character 2 [en]: Er, the orangutan won't come to strangers so, um, I'll need to coax her out myself while you, [pleading], handle the ventilation systems, and well, [exhausted], pray we're fast enough.

Character 1 [en]: [sharp] Two minutes in, two minutes out, no exceptions because that cloud is, [ominously], already turning the sky yellow and once it hits, [trailing off], we won't get a second chance.

Character 2 [en]: [resolute] I know, um, the risks but these animals would, er, die for me too if they could, [emotionally], understand what that meant.

Character 1 [en]: Then we move now because every second we argue is, [harshly], another second closer to that poison reaching us and, [quietly], making this whole discussion pointless.

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] Um, you're right, I mean, let's go save who we can while, er, we still have the chance.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] After this is over, we'll come back for the rest with proper, [reassuringly], equipment and a full hazmat team.

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] Just promise me we'll try everything possible to, [bravely], save them all, even if it seems impossible.
