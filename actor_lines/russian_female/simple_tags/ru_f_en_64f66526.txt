=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] So this is where the magic happens, huh? I've seen your work in, uh, what was it—Crimson Tide 3? The underwater sequences with those bioluminescent creatures were absolutely stunning.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You actually watched that one? Most investors just look at box office numbers, they don't usually, um, pay attention to the creature work specifically, especially in the lesser-known sequels.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] Well, I believe in understanding what I'm investing in, you know? Can't just throw money at something without knowing the craft behind it. [clears throat] Speaking of which, what's this piece you're working on here?

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Oh, this one's actually not for a film. It's, uh, more of a personal project. My mentor passed away last month and I'm creating this as a sort of memorial piece—recreating the first creature we ever built together.

Character 1 [en]: [awkwardly] I see. That's, um, that's quite touching. Though I imagine it doesn't exactly pay the bills, does it? How much studio time are you dedicating to non-revenue projects?

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] About forty hours so far, maybe more. [quietly] Look, I know it doesn't make financial sense, but some things matter more than profit margins, Mr. Harrison.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Of course, of course. I didn't mean to sound insensitive, it's just that, well, investors tend to worry about sustainability and all that. [pause] What exactly are you recreating here?

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] It's a werewolf transformation suit from 1987. We spent six months just on the facial mechanics alone—no CGI back then, everything was practical, servos and latex and, er, lots of failed attempts. [chuckles] See these stress marks? Each one represents a night we stayed past midnight trying to get the jaw hinge right.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Sounds incredibly tedious. Why not just, I don't know, use modern techniques? Surely you could recreate it faster with current technology?

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] Because that would miss the entire point! The imperfections, the hand-sculpted details, the way we had to problem-solve without computers—that's what made it ours. [sighs] My mentor always said the struggle is part of the art.

Character 1 [en]: [uncomfortably] Right, yeah, the struggle. [nervously] Listen, I should probably review your financial documents before we discuss any potential investment. Do you keep those on-site or...?

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Financial documents? I thought your assistant already collected those during the preliminary review last week? That's what she told me when she scheduled this studio tour.

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] Oh, yes, of course she did. I just meant, um, updated projections. You know how these things change week to week. Markets and whatnot.

Character 2 [en]: [suspicious] Hm. Weird, because I literally just sent updated projections yesterday afternoon to the email your assistant provided. Did you not receive them?

Character 1 [en]: [anxiously] Must be a server issue on my end. Happens sometimes with, uh, with our encrypted systems. [speeding up] Look, maybe we should focus on the creative aspects for now, I can always review numbers later.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] You know what? I just realized something. You said you loved the bioluminescent creatures in Crimson Tide 3, but we didn't do that film. [pause] We did Crimson Tide 2. Studio brought in a different effects house for the third one.

Character 1 [en]: [defeated] Ah. Well, that's, um... [sighs] Look, I should go. This was clearly a mistake.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically] A mistake? Or a con? [firmly] Because I'm guessing 'Mr. Harrison' isn't even your real name, is it? Though I have to admit, you almost had me going with that interest in the memorial piece.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] The interest was real. [very quietly] My grandfather built model trains by hand, spent decades perfecting tiny details nobody would ever notice. I actually do understand why you'd spend forty hours on something that won't make you a dime.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Then why all this? Why pretend to be someone you're not when you clearly understand what actually matters here? [pause] You could've just asked to see the work.
