=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Um, I keep looking at your face while we're, [confused], going over these harbor specs and, well, I swear I, [shaky voice], know you from somewhere but I, er, can't quite place it. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] People say that sometimes but trust me, [bitter], you don't know me—I've only been working these docks for about six months now.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Wait, did you grow up around here because there's something about, [slowly], the way you tie those knots that reminds me of someone.

Character 2 [en]: Well, um, I lived here a long time ago but, [regretful], that was before everything changed, you know, before I had to leave.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Oh my God, um, you're Danny Miller aren't you—I mean, we used to, [trembling], race bikes down to this exact harbor every summer until, [whispering], that night at the quarry. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, er, I go by Dan now and, well, I really don't want to, [anxious], talk about what happened back then, umm, especially not here. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, everyone thought you were dead after Tommy, well, [upset], after what happened to Tommy that night, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Tommy made his own choice to jump first and I've spent twenty years, [exhausted], replaying that moment wishing I could have stopped him.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Um, Danny—Dan—I'm not blaming you, I mean, we were all just kids being, [sympathetically], stupid and reckless, er, none of us knew how deep that water really was.

Character 2 [en]: Well, you know, staying would have meant facing his parents every day and I just, [crying while speaking], couldn't handle seeing their faces knowing I was there, um, knowing I survived when he didn't. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] His mom actually asked about you for years, [relieved], wondering if you were okay somewhere out there, [passionately], never once blamed you for what happened.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] She asked about me even after I just, [guilty], disappeared without saying anything to anyone? [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [advising] Look, um, I think maybe it's time you, [stern], stopped punishing yourself for something that, well, [firmly], wasn't really your fault, you know. [clearing throat]

Character 2 [en]: Er, coming back here to work these docks, I mean, [frustrated], it wasn't supposed to lead to this conversation but maybe, [hopeful], maybe I needed to hear it.

Character 1 [en]: [sincerely] Well, um, we're going to be working together on this harbor project for, [friendly], the next three months so maybe we can, er, [optimistic], catch up properly over some beers sometime. [chuckle]

Character 2 [en]: I, um, don't really do the social thing much anymore but, well, [contemplative], yeah, maybe that wouldn't be the worst idea. [trailing off]

Character 1 [en]: You know, the concrete I'm pouring here is going to, [metaphorically], last fifty years at least—maybe it's, [philosophical], time you built something permanent too instead of, [empathetically], drifting from port to port. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Um, permanent sounds terrifying after running for so long but, well, [vulnerable], this old harbor does feel like home, you know, [softly], even with all the ghosts.

Character 1 [en]: [encouraging] Well, er, ghosts have less power when you, [wisely], face them in daylight with old friends who, um, [warmly], remember the good times too, not just that one terrible night. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Um, well, okay then.
