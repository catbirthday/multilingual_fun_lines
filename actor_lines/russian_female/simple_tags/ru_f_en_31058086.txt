Scenario: A carbon fiber specialist is fitting a werewolf with experimental restraints designed to withstand their transformation, but both are skeptical about whether technology can truly contain nature's fury.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So, um, these carbon fiber restraints are, [skeptical], engineered to withstand about twelve thousand pounds of tensile force, but, well, I have to be, [serious], honest that we've never tested them against anything quite like you know, your specific condition.

Character 2 [en]: The last engineer who claimed to have, [bitter], unbreakable restraints ended up with his entire lab, [frustrated], destroyed and his insurance company, [anxious], refusing to cover what they called quote unquote acts of supernatural violence.

Character 1 [en]: [knowledgeable] The molecular structure of this particular weave creates, [confident], a lattice pattern that actually gets stronger under sudden stress rather than, [analytical], fracturing like traditional materials. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Look, um, I've been through seventeen different, [exhausted], containment systems over the past five years and, well, every single one has failed when the transformation really takes hold, you know?

Character 1 [en]: What you need to understand is that carbon fiber isn't just, [passionately], strong—it has this unique property where the fibers actually, [enunciating every word], redistribute force across the entire matrix rather than concentrating it at, [excited], stress points. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So you're telling me that these black straps can actually, [hesitantly], withstand the kind of force that bent steel bars like, [slowly], they were made of aluminum foil? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: Well, uh, the tensile strength data suggests that, [firmly], these restraints could theoretically hold, um, something with about three times the force output of, er, what you've described.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] You haven't seen what happens when the moon is full and every, [shaky voice], cell in my body tears itself apart and rebuilds into something that doesn't even, [regretful], remember being human. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] I've studied your previous containment failures and noticed that, [thoughtful], they all failed at connection points not the actual restraint material itself.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Yeah well, um, that's because the transformation doesn't just make me, [angry], stronger, it makes me, like, desperate to escape, you know? [groan]

Character 1 [en]: That's exactly why, um, I designed these with, [proudly], seamless molecular bonding at every junction point so there's literally, [animated], no weak link in the entire system, I mean, theoretically anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I appreciate that you're actually listening to my concerns instead of just, [relieved], insisting your technology is foolproof like all the others did. [chuckle]

Character 1 [en]: The thing is, well, um, I've incorporated tungsten carbide, [very quietly], reinforcement threads that are basically impossible to tear even with, [nervous], supernatural strength, but, uh, I still recommend backup protocols.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, um, I don't mean to sound ungrateful because clearly you've put, [sincerely], enormous thought into this design, well, more than anyone else has anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] They'll hold.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] How can you be so certain when you just admitted that this is all, [worried], theoretical and you've never actually tested them against a real transformation?

Character 1 [en]: Because, um, I didn't just design these for any werewolf—I studied, [intently], your specific transformation patterns from the security footage and, well, calculated the exact force vectors you generate, [methodical], during your worst episodes. [cough]

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] Wait, you actually watched hours of footage of me, [trembling], transforming and destroying everything around me just to, [very sincerely], design better restraints? [gasp softly]

Character 1 [en]: Every failed restraint taught me something about how your transformation, [determined], distributes force and these carbon fiber bands are specifically engineered to counter, [passionate], those exact pressure points. [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [hopeful] So, um, when the full moon rises tomorrow night, well, these things might actually, [cautiously], give me the first peaceful transformation I've had in, uh, almost a decade? [deep breath]
