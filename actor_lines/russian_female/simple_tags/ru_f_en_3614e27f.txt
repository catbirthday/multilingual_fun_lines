Scenario: A canal operator meets her estranged sister, now a successful dialogue editor, at their father's funeral after ten years of silence.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I didn't know if you'd, [hesitantly], come back for this after all these years of, [trailing off], silence between us.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Well, um, I've been editing dialogue for films about, like, families reuniting and, [bitter], here I am living the cliché of, you know, [whispering], coming home for a funeral.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Dad used to sit by the locks, um, watching boats pass through and, well, [very melancholic], asking if I'd heard from you while I worked the gates, er, [slowly], every single Tuesday without fail.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] The sound of water moving through those, [shaky voice], canal chambers still appears in my dreams sometimes, [crying while speaking], like a heartbeat I can't escape. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, you always said the canal was, [softly], too small for your ambitions, but, um, here we both are anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] In my work I splice together, [confused], conversations between actors pretending to care about each other while, [anxious], my own sister became a stranger.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] The water keeps flowing whether we're, [exhausted], here to guide it or not, just like time kept, [very sad], moving without us speaking.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Sometimes when I'm working late, [whispering loudly], removing breath sounds from recordings, I remember us as kids shouting across the locks.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, every boat that passes through reminds me of, [nostalgic], how you left, just, er, [quietly], sliding away into another life entirely.

Character 2 [en]: [tearful] I edit out the, um, awkward pauses in movie dialogues but, well, [trembling], can't fix the decade-long pause between us, you know, [clearing throat], no matter how skilled I've become. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] The canal taught me that water always, [hopefully], finds its level eventually, even when the path seems, [warmly], impossibly complicated or blocked.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe we can start again.

Character 1 [en]: [shy] I still have your old room above the lockkeeper's house, [tenderly], exactly as you left it that morning you drove away.

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] After all this time you never, [emotionally], changed anything in there, not even the, [overwhelmed], film posters I left on the walls?

Character 1 [en]: [vulnerable] Well, um, I kept thinking that, like, maybe one day you'd need, [hopeful], somewhere to come back to, you know, [whispered], somewhere that remembered who you were before. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] In my job, um, I spend hours making dialogue sound, well, natural and meaningful but, [sincerely], nothing I've edited comes close to, er, [softly speaking], what you just said.

Character 1 [en]: Um, well, stay then.

Character 2 [en]: [peaceful] The real conversations we need to have can't be, umm, [accepting], edited or perfected, they just have to, well, [gently], happen as messy and raw as they come, like, [very quietly], this one right now. [deep breath]

Character 1 [en]: Dad would've loved knowing we're finally, [smiling speaking], talking again by his beloved canal locks where, [happily], everything eventually flows together.

Character 2 [en]: [moved] Um, yeah, he would.
