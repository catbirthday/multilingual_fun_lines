=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] Um, Alex, is that—I mean, I can't believe it's, [shaky voice], actually you sitting here after all these, [quietly], years since we last, [trailing off], spoke.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] I didn't know you worked here, and honestly if I'd, [bitter], known I probably would have chosen a different, [hesitantly], VA facility for this appointment.

Character 1 [en]: [warm] Listen, whatever happened between us back then doesn't, [empathetically], matter right now because you're here seeking help and that's, [very sincerely], brave and I'm genuinely, [relieved], glad you're taking care of yourself.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] The forms asked about emergency contacts and I almost, [mumbling], wrote your name out of habit before remembering we haven't, [slowly], talked since everything fell apart.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, well, I mean—

Character 2 [en]: You became a healthcare navigator while I disappeared into, [monotone], coding and data systems where emotions don't exist.

Character 1 [en]: That's not true though—you always felt things too, [deeply], deeply which is probably why you're here now.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Well, um, the algorithms I write don't, [sarcastic], judge me for needing therapy and they don't, [coldly], remind me of promises I broke years ago, you know? [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: I mean, um, I've been working here long enough to, [gently], know that everyone who walks through these doors is carrying, [studying], something heavy and, well, yours just happens to be something, [very quietly], I recognize. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] Um, I've been having these panic attacks at work, you know, and, [shaky voice], nobody there knows what to do with me. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [confidently] Well, um, I can help you navigate the system, er, find the right therapist who specializes in, [professionally], anxiety disorders, and make sure you get the, [warmly], support you need.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Thank you.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Um, you know, I've wondered over the years if you were, I mean, doing okay out there in Silicon Valley.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Well, um, the money's good but the isolation is, er, [hollow], killing me slowly and I wake up every morning wondering if this is, [regretful], all there is. [groan]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] Um, well, maybe this is a chance to, you know, rebuild something even if it's just, [carefully], professional support for now.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] The truth is I've been writing code that analyzes, [breaking], mental health patterns while ignoring my own completely.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, um, that's actually more common than you'd think—I mean, helpers often, [knowingly], struggle to help themselves and er, tech people especially tend to, [sympathetic], intellectualize their pain. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Um, I guess, well, seeing you here makes this feel less like, [trembling], failing and more like maybe, [hopefully], finding my way back to something. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [inviting] My office hours are Monday through Friday and you can, [earnest], always reach me directly if you need help navigating appointments or just, [tenderly], need someone who understands your history. [clearing throat]

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] I mean, um, after everything that happened between us, well, you offering to help me through this is more than I, [emotional], deserve but exactly what I, [whispering loudly], need right now. [cry]
