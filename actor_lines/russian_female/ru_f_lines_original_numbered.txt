============================================================

1. Oh, um, yeah I totally get that—I actually just had this happen to me last week with, uh, with a birthday gift for my mom, so let me just—let me pull up your account here and we'll, um, we'll figure this out together, what's your order number?
2. Perfect, so I'm seeing order RK-4429-J here and, um, yeah it's showing it shipped out yesterday at, let me see, 3:47 PM with tracking number TRK88291064, and it's currently, uh, in transit through our Cincinnati distribution center.
3. Right right.
4. So here's what I—actually no wait, let me just—okay so, um, I've done this before and basically what happens is, uh, we can submit what's called an intercept request with form INT-7792-B to the carrier, and, um, about seventy percent of the time they can reroute it before final delivery.
5. Yeah so, um, I know that's not, like, the most reassuring number but, uh, honestly in my experience—and I've been here three years—it usually works if the package is still, um, more than twenty-four hours from delivery, which yours is according to tracking data TRK88291064.
6. So the intercept request INT-7792-B takes, uh, usually about two to four hours to process, and then you'll get, um, you'll get an email to confirm whether it worked or not—I'll make sure to flag it as priority though.
7. I mean, I—actually, um, you know what? Let me just, uh, let me share something with you. That package I mentioned for my mom? Same exact situation, intercept went through fine, so I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna handle yours the exact same way I did mine.
8. Oh I hear you.
9. So if the intercept doesn't work—and again, um, I really think it will—but if it doesn't, uh, we can either issue a full refund with code REF-9902-ALL once the package returns to us, or, um, we can rush a replacement to your new address with overnight shipping at no charge.
10. Okay so, um, that's 482 Pine Street, and I need, uh, let me just—I need the city, state, and zip too, and then I'll submit this intercept request INT-7792-B right away and, um, you should have that confirmation email within, like, four hours max.
11. Oh, I think I can definitely—wait, let me just—actually yes, I'm probably going to be able to protect you from losing out on savings here. What's the, um, what's the... the item you purchased?
12. Perfect, okay so I'm pulling up your account now and I want to make sure we get this completely sorted for you so you don't have any worries going forward, alright?
13. Right right, so um, I'm seeing your order here, it's ORD-4428-QM91, and uh, let me just—actually, you know what? I think we can, er, definitely fix this for you.
14. Absolutely, and I'm going to make sure this gets processed correctly the first time so you don't have to call back or worry about anything, your refund reference will be REF-8837-PK22.
15. So basically, um, what I'm doing is—let me find the right—it's kind of like a retroactive adjustment? And um, I'm going to put a note on your account, uh, number ACC-9102-ZM, so if this ever happens again, we'll know to just, you know, automatically help you out.
16. I think it's usually—no wait, let me check—actually for this type of adjustment it's probably going to be three to five business days back to your original payment method.
17. Oh no no, I'm not going to let that happen, um, I'm actually putting in a priority flag on this, uh, transaction TXN-5549-BK88, and um, I'll personally monitor it to make sure it processes.
18. Yes, and here's what I'm going to do—I'm setting up an automatic email confirmation that'll go out, um, probably within the hour with tracking number TRK-2215-QQ91, so you'll have everything documented.
19. That's exactly right, and um, you know what? I'm also going to—what's the word—like future-proof this? I'm adding you to our price protection list under code PRT-7763-MM so this kind of thing gets caught automatically.
20. Nothing at all, I've got you completely covered here, confirmation number for everything is CNF-8820-LP44, and I really want to make sure you feel secure about this whole thing, okay?
21. Oh no, I'm—I'm so sorry that happened. Let me—let me pull up your account. Do you have your—your case number from the previous call? It should be something like CAS-something?
22. Got it, got it. CAS-8847-ZM. I can—I can see here you were speaking with... with Marcus about forty minutes ago? I'm going to make sure we get this completely resolved today, okay? No more—no more disconnections.
23. That's—that's frustrating, I know. Let me get—get you to a manager right away, but first I want to—I want to document everything in ticket TKT-9923-LP so this doesn't happen again. What—what were you working on with Marcus?
24. Double—double charged, that's not okay. I see it—I see it here in your account ACC-7761-QR. You know what? Before I transfer you, I'm—I'm going to add a priority flag. My mom had the same thing happen last month with her phone bill.
25. Of course, of course. I'm—I'm connecting you to Sarah, she's—she's our billing manager. But first, I'm applying—applying a courtesy credit, reference REF-3847-BK, just so you know we're—we're taking care of this.
26. Good—good thinking. If it drops, call back with—with reference REF-3847-BK and ask for Sarah directly. I'm also—I'm also putting my direct extension in the notes. It's—it's 4782.
27. She's—she's ready. One more thing though, I'm—I'm seeing here your account has the—the old billing system. After Sarah fixes this, I want to—want to migrate you to the new one. Code MIG-2250-XL. It'll prevent this—this from happening again.
28. Transferring—transferring now. Sarah will see everything I've—I've documented. Your case—case number is still CAS-8847-ZM. You've been really—really patient.
29. Stay on—stay on the line, exactly. Sometimes it takes—takes about fifteen seconds. The system shows—shows you're queued with priority flag PRI-1148-TG.
30. You're—you're very welcome. Sarah's picking up—picking up any second now. Have a—have a great rest of your day, and remember, extension 4782 if you need—need anything else.
31. Okay so... let me just... what's the word I'm looking for here... pull up your account details, and um I can see you're registered as Artisan Roasters with account number ACC-9847-RB22, is that correct?
32. Right so, um, I'm... hmm... checking your fulfillment dashboard here and uh, it looks like... wait, let me... okay so there's a batch of subscription orders, reference SUB-3392-KL through SUB-3439-KL that are showing as, um, what's it saying... "pending carrier pickup" for like, er, nine days now?
33. I know, I know, and um, honestly I'm seeing this with, uh, a lot of our merchant accounts lately, there's been some... hmm... system issues with the automated shipping labels, batch code ERR-50923-X keeps popping up.
34. Yeah no, totally, I mean, um, I get it, people need their coffee and uh, you're taking the heat for something that's... hmm... not even your fault really, so let me, er, dig deeper into tracking number TRK-882947561 here.
35. Absolutely.
36. Oh man, so... okay I'm, um, I'm pulling up the priority escalation form now, ticket number ESC-7741-QP90, because this is... yeah this definitely needs immediate attention, especially for a new business.
37. Right right, so um, what I'm gonna do is... er... how do I explain this... basically I'm flagging all forty of those orders, IDs starting with ORD-6620-AU through ORD-6659-AU for, um, expedited reshipment today.
38. Um, yeah so technically I'm, uh, supposed to get manager approval for anything over twenty orders but, hmm, seeing as it's our system that messed up, I'm just gonna, er, process it under exception code EXC-1107-Z.
39. Good good.
40. Hey no, I mean, um, I totally get it, chasing your dream is... it's scary and, er, for what it's worth, looking at your customer retention rate here, metric score MET-94.7, you're actually doing something right, so um, these forty orders will ship today with tracking prefix TRK-9000-RUSH and, hmm, we're also crediting your account three months of platform fees, credit code CRD-2280-MP, for the inconvenience.
41. Oh I'm so—let me just—I'm really sorry about that phone system, it's um, it's way too complicated and I'm actually gonna, like, put a note here under your account REF-4421-NK about that so basically we can track how long people are waiting and um hopefully fix it.
42. Right right.
43. Absolutely, so um, here's what I'm gonna do—I'm pulling up your account right now with ID ACC-8892-QM and like, I can see your previous calls and um, yeah you shouldn't have had to wait that long so basically I'm gonna make sure—actually let me just—I'm gonna personally handle whatever you need today.
44. Okay so let me—I'm looking at your billing statement BIL-7745-XD right now and um, can you tell me like what specific charge looks wrong so basically I can, uh, I can get this fixed immediately and also make sure it doesn't happen again?
45. Got it.
46. No no, sorry, I was just—so I found it, charge FEE-9021-LP and um, you're absolutely right, that's completely wrong, like there's no reason for that fee and basically I'm removing it right now and uh, actually I'm also gonna—let me just credit next month too for the hassle.
47. So here's the thing—I can just—actually your confirmation for the removal is CNF-5584-RT and like, it's already done, and um basically I'm also putting what we call a billing shield note BSN-2109-AK on your account so these random fees can't just, uh, appear anymore without manager approval.
48. Yeah so, um, I totally get why you'd think—actually let me—so what I'm doing different is like, I'm setting up an automatic alert ALT-6672-MM that goes to me personally if any fee over ten dollars hits your account and basically, uh, here's my direct extension 4429 so you can just—you can skip that whole phone tree.
49. Absolutely yeah.
50. So basically just—I'm gonna make sure this is the last time you deal with this and um, your case number is CSE-3387-VB if you need it but like, honestly just call me direct if anything weird shows up and uh, I'll handle it before it even becomes a thing, okay?
51. Okay so let me just, um, pull up your account here real quick— sorry, it's been a crazy morning— can I get your member ID?
52. Got it got it, so MEH-7823, and um, I'm seeing here that— okay so there's a charge from yesterday for $47.82, transaction ID TXN-9847-QM2, is that the one?
53. Right so, um, let me dig into this a bit more here, sometimes these take a day to post so it might actually be from— oh wait, hmm, this is interesting.
54. So basically what happened is, uh, this charge— it's coded as RMB-4721-X which is, um, a reimbursement credit actually, not a charge, the system just displays it weird.
55. Yeah exactly, so like someone from your employer submitted a, uh, wellness reimbursement claim CLM-8374-B2 for your flu shot last month and it just, um, posted backwards on the app.
56. No no no, honestly? This happens like, um, fifty times a day, the way our system shows credits is, uh, completely ridiculous, I keep telling them to fix it.
57. Yep yep, so confirmation number CNF-9982-AA7 for your records, and um, it should show correctly in like, uh, two hours once the system refreshes.
58. Oh totally, healthcare workers get the worst benefits which is, um, pretty ironic if you ask me— so anyway your new balance after this credit posts will be, uh, let's see here, $284.19.
59. So like, is there anything else I can, um, help with today? Oh and just so you know, reference number REF-7729-MK3 if you need to call back about this.
60. Seriously don't even worry about it, like I said, our display is, uh, basically designed to confuse people so— anyway you have a good rest of your day, okay?
61. Oh! Okay so, hmm, let me just... pull that up here. What's your, um, what's your order number?
62. Alright alright, so I'm looking at ORD-4482-JK9 here and, hmm, you're right it went into processing about... let me see here... two hours ago. But, um, between you and me? I might have a little trick up my sleeve.
63. So technically, um, once it hits processing we're not supposed to touch it, but... hmm, what if I told you there's a, uh, there's a window? About four hours where I can still, you know, work some magic.
64. Let me just, um, let me see here... okay so I'm putting in a special override code, it's, uh, CXL-98234-Z, and basically what this does is... hang on... yep! Got it stopped.
65. Mmhmm! So, um, here's the fun part though. Your confirmation number for the cancellation is, uh, let me grab this... CNF-7765-QR22, and you should get your refund in about, hmm, three to five business days.
66. Oh but wait wait, there's more! So I'm also, um, I'm also seeing here that because of the, uh, the inconvenience? I can throw in a, hmm, let me check... yep, a 20% discount code for your next order.
67. The code is, um, SAVE20-KLM449, and honestly? Between you and me, these codes usually only go to, uh, you know, the really upset customers but... I think you deserve something nice today.
68. Oh no, that's... hmm, that's exhausting. Hey, you know what? Let me, um, let me also add a note to your account here, reference number REF-8823-TT, that basically flags you for, uh, expedited service next time.
69. It's going to be okay, really. I've, um, I've tagged your account and added all these perks so, hmm, next time you order? Should be smooth sailing. Transaction ID for all this is TXN-445789623.
70. Aww! Well, um, don't tell anyone but, hmm, sometimes we just like to, you know, surprise people who are having rough weeks. Your cancellation receipt RCP-9982-XM should hit your email in about, uh, five minutes!
71. Oh! Hmm, okay so let me, uh, pull that up for you—what's your claim number? Should be like, um, WRC followed by some digits.
72. Got it, um, so I'm seeing WRC-4428-B here and, uh, hmm, looks like they flagged it for—oh wait, let me see what happened here...
73. Right right, so, um, according to this, uh, they denied it based on—hmm—"physical damage indicators" on unit MW-7739-XK, which is, er, interesting...
74. No no, you're not stupid at all! Um, so like, sometimes these inspectors, uh, they mark things as damage that are, hmm, really just normal wear, you know?
75. Actually, wait—I'm seeing something here. Your purchase date shows PO-8827-ML from fourteen months ago, but your extended warranty EXT-9902 should cover twenty-four months total...
76. No, you're absolutely right! So, uh, lemme dig deeper here—sometimes the system, um, doesn't sync properly between warranty codes and, uh, the inspection reports...
77. Oh! Okay so, um, I found the issue—they ran it under standard warranty code STD-100 instead of your extended plan EXT-9902-ML, which is, uh, honestly ridiculous on their part.
78. Exactly. Look, um, between you and me? This happens, like, way too often. The inspectors don't check the extended plans properly.
79. Already on it! So I'm, uh, resubmitting under approval code APV-7734-RMK with the correct warranty, and, um, marking it priority because honestly? Three weeks waiting is enough.
80. Nah, should process in, hmm, forty-eight hours max with tracking TRK-5502-J. Yeah, our warranty system is, uh, kinda terrible sometimes but we gotcha covered!
81. Okay okay. So um, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—oh wow, you really are, um, one of our long-timers. Account number ACC-4982-VX. I think. I think we can, uh, definitely work something out here.
82. Right right. So, um, between you and me? Your promotional rate PRO-867-Q expires tomorrow but, uh, I'm seeing some wiggle room. I mean, technically I'm not supposed to just, um, extend these but... let me check something.
83. Well. Here's the thing. Um, corporate has these, uh, these rules about promotional extensions under code EXT-3399-M, but um, for someone who's been with us since, hmm, 2012? I think I can, uh, maybe find a loophole or two.
84. Oh absolutely. Definitely. Look, um, I'm pulling up your payment history here—reference number REF-7621-KLP—and uh, you've never missed a payment. Not once. So I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna fight for you here, okay?
85. Between us? Um, I hate when good customers like you get, uh, get pushed around by the system. So here's what I'm thinking—I can probably, um, maybe get you another six months at your current rate under promo code NEW-PRO-5544-X.
86. Hold on. Hold on. Let me, um, let me try something else. I'm gonna—okay so there's this, uh, loyalty retention program LRP-9902-ZK that I think, um, I think I can squeeze you into. Might be twelve months instead.
87. Perfect. So um, I'm just gonna, uh, need to override some things here. The system's being—hmm, it's being a bit stubborn. Transaction pending under TXN-885214-Q. But um, don't worry, I've got tricks.
88. Hey hey. No worries. I mean, um, I'd be upset too if I thought I was losing my rate after twelve years. That's just, uh, that's not right. Okay so, um, good news—approval just came through under confirmation APV-7763-RX.
89. All set. Twelve months. Same rate. And um, here's a secret—next year when it's about to expire? Call back and, uh, ask for the retention team directly. Reference this call ID CID-9984-TK. We'll um, we'll take care of you again.
90. My pleasure. Genuinely. Um, you should get an email confirmation—tracking number EML-3367-VP—within the hour. And uh, between you and me? Thanks for sticking with us all these years. We need more customers like you.
91. Oh, um, okay so—let me just—I'm pulling up our parts catalog here and, uh, I'm so sorry but I need to get your account number first if that's, um, if that's alright?
92. [exhales] Right, okay so ACC-7741-R and I see you're, um, listed as a certified repair technician which is—I mean that's great—so for bulk pricing I would need to, uh, transfer you to our wholesale department?
93. Oh, I'm—I'm really sorry about that, um, so the thing is—wait, actually—are you looking for specific model parts or just, uh, general inventory?
94. [sharp inhale] Okay so, um, I'm looking at part WPW10340443 and, uh, I'm seeing—oh gosh I'm so sorry—it's showing ninety-eight fifty and I don't—I mean, I don't see any bulk options in my system here?
95. I'm so, so sorry about this, I really—[exhales]—I wish I could see what you're seeing but my system just, um, it doesn't show those wholesale tiers and I feel terrible because I know you probably need these parts for your customers, right?
96. Um, wait, let me—no actually—okay so what if I, uh, put in a pricing review request? It's form PRF-5502-A and, um, basically our pricing team would review your account history?
97. [exhales] Oh good, I'm—I mean I'm glad I can at least do something here because, um, honestly these systems are so limited and I hate not being able to just, you know, give you the right price immediately.
98. Yeah, I can imagine that's, um, incredibly frustrating and I'm so sorry you've been getting the runaround—so for the review I need to, uh, document which parts you typically order in bulk?
99. Got it, okay so I'm—let me just—I'm adding those to request PRF-5502-A and, um, I really wish I could guarantee this will fix the pricing but, uh, at least it gets escalated to people who actually understand wholesale accounts?
100. Um, you're so welcome, I just—[exhales]—I'm sorry our system makes this so difficult when you're clearly, you know, a professional who knows exactly what these parts should cost, and um, you'll get an email confirmation in about ten minutes with reference number REF-8847-QM22.
101. Oh, um, I hear you, and uh, first let me just say I'm—I'm really sorry you're going through this, that's um, that's got to be so hard, let me pull up your account here, what's your account number?
102. Hey no worries at all, um, we'll figure this out together okay? So uh, let me search by phone number, that usually works best, and um, I can see here—yeah got it, account ACC-92847-M, joint account, and uh, listen I've helped with these before, we're gonna make this as easy as possible.
103. You absolutely keep your number, um, that's yours forever if you want it, so uh, what we'll do is create a new individual account just for you, transfer your line over, and um, basically your ex—er, the other party—they'll stay on the original account REF-2024-83921.
104. Thursday, got it, um, and honestly? We're gonna have this done today, like uh, right now actually, so you'll be way ahead of that deadline, and um, I'm putting a priority flag PSF-7731-Q on this so nothing gets delayed.
105. Yeah let me check, um, so I see two phones, one tablet, and uh, an Apple Watch, all under plan PLN-4428-BC, so um, which devices do you want to keep on your new account?
106. That makes total sense, um, keeping it simple is smart right now, and uh, you can always add stuff later if you want, but for now let's just get you set up with your phone on account ACC-92847-N1, that's your new individual account number.
107. Oh gosh, um, listen, you're going through enough already, like uh, the last thing you need is hassle from your phone company, right? So um, I've got your new account created, monthly rate drops to $65, and uh, I'm actually applying credit CRD-3392 for your first month free.
108. Right right, um, so together you were paying $140 for everything, but uh, your individual line is just $65, so you're actually saving quite a bit, and with that credit I added, reference RCR-66120-A, you won't pay anything until next month.
109. It's done! Like um, literally while we've been talking, I processed it all, so uh, you're already on your own account, confirmation CON-94428-YR is in your email, and um, he can't see your bills, can't make changes, nothing, you're completely independent now.
110. Hey no no no, um, don't apologize at all, you're doing great, and uh, look I put my direct extension EXT-4420 in your account notes, so if you need anything else, like um, anything at all, you just call and ask for me directly, okay? We've got your back through this.
111. Oh hi! Um, yes absolutely, so like I'm definitely having a great day thank you so much for asking! So basically, uh, what I can do is, um, pull up your account here if you've got your account number or, uh, maybe your phone number? I'm like super happy to help you with any notification stuff!
112. Perfect perfect! So um, I'm just gonna, uh, type that in here and—okay so like your account ID is showing as ACC-9847-QM22 and, um, I can totally see all your preferences and everything so, uh, what specifically about notifications did you wanna, you know, adjust or change today?
113. Oh! Okay okay so like, I totally get that, um, nobody likes surprises with their account right? So basically what I'm seeing here is, uh, your notification settings are kinda all over the place—like some are on, some are off, um, and it looks like maybe the system defaulted to, uh, I think SMS only? But we can definitely, um, fix that!
114. Right right, so um, that's actually, uh, super common! Like basically what happens is, um, sometimes when we do system updates—and your last update was, uh, let me see here, October 14th with reference code REF-5521-XK—so like those updates can sometimes, um, kinda reset things? Which is, uh, honestly pretty frustrating, I know!
115. Yes! So, um, what I can do right now is, uh, basically set up what we call, um, "advance notifications" on your profile—that's code ANP-7764-B by the way—and like, you'll get emails, texts, um, even push notifications if you want? At least, uh, 48 hours before any changes!
116. Exactly exactly! So um, I'm gonna, uh, just tick all these boxes here and, hmm, okay so like there's email, SMS to that 555-0147 number, and, um, do you want push notifications too? I mean, uh, some people find them annoying but like, they're pretty instant, you know?
117. Aw, um, you're so nice! Okay so like, I'm setting all three and, uh, your new notification ID is, um, NOT-4429-TT98, and basically now you'll get, uh, warnings for everything—billing changes, service updates, um, maintenance, like literally everything at least two days ahead!
118. Oh! Um, billing, like with a B! So basically, uh, any time your payment amount changes or, um, if there's like a new charge or fee or whatever, you'll know! And, uh, actually I should mention—so unfortunately I can't, um, make it more than 48 hours notice? Like I really wish I could but, uh, the system only lets me do two days max.
119. So um, just to confirm everything—and like, I'm gonna send you an email with all this too, confirmation number CNF-8892-LP—but, uh, basically you're all set for advance notifications via email, text, and, um, push notifications, all going forward from, uh, literally right now! Is there, um, anything else about the notifications you need?
120. Oh yes! So, um, security alerts are actually, uh, separate—those are instant because, like, you know, security—but I can also add, um, what we call "security digest" notifications? So like, you'd get a weekly summary with code, uh, SEC-3347-WD, showing any login attempts or, um, password changes or basically any security activity, and that comes every Monday morning!
121. Oh man. Okay. I actually—this happens way more than you'd think. Let me just. Pull up the recovery tool here. Can I get the email? The one from the old account?
122. Got it. J.peters.82. So I'm seeing here—hang on. There's actually. Three accounts? With variations of that email. One's showing, uh, last activity in 2019. Account ID ACC-7751-QR92.
123. Yeah so, um, here's the thing—and I literally went through this myself last month with my Netflix—the system just, uh, it kind of archives things after two years of inactivity? Your purchase history though. That's all there. Order numbers starting with ORD-2019-8843.
124. I can—wait, actually—let me do this differently. Faster. Transaction log shows, um, probably like forty-seven digital purchases? Reference code TXN-BATCH-8827A. I think I can migrate these.
125. Okay so. Good news. Bad news. Good news—I can absolutely get these back for you. Bad news—well, sort of bad—it's gonna generate like, um, a ton of emails. Confirmation code RMG-99284-Z for each transfer.
126. Listen, I, uh—between you and me? Our account recovery system is. Garbage. Complete garbage. But I'm gonna—hold on—I'm initiating this under ticket ID TKT-55901-MNX22.
127. Usually it's—no wait, sorry—for bulk transfers? It's different. Maybe, um, six hours? Eight hours tops? You'll get a master confirmation. Number MIG-77205-COMPLETE.
128. So here's what'll happen. And this is, uh, kind of annoying but. You'll get a temporary password. Code format TMP-PASS-9982X. Then immediately have to change it. Then verify your phone. Then probably—actually definitely—two-factor setup again.
129. I know. I know. Trust me. Last month when I—look, I spent three hours. Three. Hours. Just to recover my old PlayStation purchases. Case number, um, mine was PSN-88412-C. The system needs. A complete overhaul.
130. Yeah, I mean, um, why pretend otherwise, right? Your migration request MIG-77205 is processing now. Check your email in—actually scratch that—check it tonight. Should all be there.
131. Okay, I see what happened here. Let me just pull up your order ALG-4492-NK and, um, yeah, you're absolutely right.
132. I understand. And I can see that loyalty history. So here's what I can do—your original order ALG-4492-NK was definitely marked as nut-free, and we completely failed on that. I'm setting up a full refund plus a credit.
133. Um, so, not just any credit. I'm, uh, applying code CMP-8837-ZT which is, um, basically our premium compensation package—it's fifty dollars plus, er, free delivery for three months.
134. Right right.
135. And, um, here's the thing. Your replacement order RLP-2290-BK is going out, uh, priority delivery tonight. Should be there in about, hmm, two hours. No charge. And I'm personally flagging it for kitchen verification.
136. Yeah so. Normally yes. But when we mess up like this. Well. I kind of. I'm putting it through as code RED-Priority. Not really supposed to for food orders but.
137. So, um, I'm also seeing here in your file FLE-7765-QM that, uh, you've had two other nut-related incidents? That's, er, that's on us, and honestly, I think we need to do better than just fixing today.
138. Mm-hmm.
139. Um, look, I probably shouldn't say this but, er, your case reference CSE-9984-AD is going to our kitchen safety team. We're going to, uh, basically review our whole allergen process because three strikes is, um, it's not acceptable.
140. So, um, just to confirm everything—refund processes in twenty-four hours under transaction TXN-445821-V, your replacement arrives tonight, and, uh, you'll get an email about the delivery credits within, hmm, about an hour. Is there, er, anything else I can help with today?
141. Oh! Okay, yes, let me—hmm, let me pull up your account here. Can I get your business name real quick?
142. Got it, Prairie Moon—okay so, um, I see your account ID is PMC-4829-XJ here and, uh, you're on our merchant subscription plan, let me just, hmm, check the billing cycles...
143. Right right, okay so—hmm, this is interesting—I'm seeing duplicate transactions on, um, let me count... looks like seventeen subscription IDs starting with SUB-7792-A through SUB-7792-Q, all processing twice on the same day.
144. No no, um, I totally get why that's, uh, super frustrating! Let me see here... okay so what happened is—and this is, um, kind of a new system thing—the payment processor batch PAY-8851-MK ran twice at midnight.
145. Oh absolutely not! Um, between you and me? This is, uh, totally on our end. System glitch. Happens sometimes with the new update we pushed last week.
146. Yes! Already on it. So, um, I'm gonna—hmm, let me just—okay so I'm issuing refund batch RFD-3094-PP right now, and uh, all seventeen customers will see their money back in, like, two to three days max.
147. Right? And, um, here's what I'm gonna do—don't tell my supervisor—but I'm adding credit code CRD-5502-YT to your account, gives you next month free for the hassle.
148. No really! It's—hmm, let me make sure—yep, credit applied! Also, um, I'm putting a note here under ticket TKT-0892-LM that if this ever happens again, we auto-refund immediately.
149. Four AM? Oof. Cheese making and, uh, dealing with billing issues? That's rough. Transaction history shows you've been with us three years—never had an issue before.
150. Hey, um, that's what I'm here for! Your confirmation for all this is CNF-6621-RX, and uh, honestly? Call me direct if you need anything—extension 4492. We'll take care of you.
151. Oh hey yeah so um basically I can totally help with that, let me just uh pull up your account real quick here and we'll figure this out together, what's the card number?
152. Perfect perfect so um I'm seeing that card here GFT-4829-MK37 and uh actually—you know what, this literally just happened to my mom last week with her card so like I totally get how confusing this is.
153. Oh absolutely so um what I'm seeing here is uh there was a transaction on, hmm, November 3rd at 2:47 PM for the full hundred dollar amount, transaction ID TXN-889274-QP, did you maybe, um, use it online somewhere?
154. Okay so uh that's super weird then, let me just, um, dig a bit deeper here because like between you and me? Sometimes these get, uh, pre-activated by accident at the store.
155. So basically um what I'm thinking—and like don't worry we're gonna fix this—but uh it looks like maybe there was a, hmm, system glitch with batch activation code BAT-7739-XL.
156. Oh man yeah no I, uh, I completely get that, like honestly the holiday rush is just, umm, it's brutal right now and uh I'm gonna make this right for you okay?
157. You're absolutely right and um actually being Platinum—which I can see here member ID PLT-338829-K—that uh gives me way more options to help you so like, between you and me? I can just issue you a replacement right now.
158. So um I'm gonna do something kinda cool here, basically uh I'm generating a new digital card, reference number REF-9928374-TZ, and um you'll have it in like literally two minutes in your email.
159. Perfect so uh that new one's already loaded with the hundred dollars and um I also threw in—don't tell my supervisor—but like an extra twenty for the hassle, courtesy credit CRT-4428-MP.
160. Hey no worries at all so um honestly like this happens more than you'd think and uh I'm just glad we could get it sorted super quick for you, anything else I can help with today?
161. Okay okay okay, let me—let me pull up your account, um, what's your—actually wait, I need your phone number first to find the—the account details.
162. Got it got it, so I'm seeing account ACC-7739-BX here and um, that's interesting, you've got—you've got multiple contracts showing, let me just—wait, are you asking about the phone service or the—the internet bundle?
163. Right right, okay so, um, your phone contract CTR-4881-PH9 has, uh, let me calculate—it's it's showing seventeen months left, and then um, the internet one, that's—that's different, that's CTR-4882-NET and that one is, hmm, only six months remaining.
164. Yeah so, um, I'm actually—hang on, this is, uh, this is weird because your phone contract started in, um, let me see here, March 2022? But then there's a—a renewal marker from REF-9923-X that happened automatically and, uh, that might be why you're confused about the timeline?
165. Looking looking, okay so, er, there's a—wait no, I see it now, there's an auto-renewal clause in section, um, 14.3 of your original terms TRM-2022-MAR-14, but but but here's what's weird...
166. Termination fee termination fee, right, so um, for the phone it's—it's showing $340 under fee code FEE-TERM-340A, but uh, wait wait wait, the internet is, hmm, that's only $85 because you're past the—the major penalty period.
167. Hmm, actually actually, let me—let me dig into something here because, um, I'm seeing a note, note ID NTE-7749-CSR, that says you called about service issues and, uh, depending on what those were we might—might have options.
168. Oh oh oh, okay so, er, you've called—I'm counting here—fourteen times according to ticket log TKT-LOG-8827, and um, if service wasn't meeting the—the guaranteed minimums in your SLA, that's document SLA-2022-STANDARD, then technically technically you might qualify for the—what do they call it—the performance release clause.
169. Possibly possibly, I need to—to verify but, um, your service records under SRV-HIST-0147 show, uh, multiple unresolved outages and, er, speeds below 40% of promised for—for at least, hmm, sixty days cumulative, which which which should trigger clause 9.2.
170. Yeah so, um, let me—let me submit this for review under case CSE-9984-RELEASE and, uh, based on what I'm seeing you should—should definitely qualify, but but I need manager approval so, er, can I put you on a brief hold while I—while I grab them real quick?
171. Okay okay yes I can absolutely help you with that let me just pull up your account here and what's the... the... merchant name showing on your statement so I can locate the subscription ID real quick for you?
172. Right right Premium Plus Monthly that's showing as subscription SUB-7724-MP and I can see here that it's been active since... let's see... November of last year so that's about eleven months now and it looks like it's for our premium content package.
173. Yeah no I totally get that happens more than you'd think actually let me just... what I'm looking for here is... the original signup method and okay so this was part of a free trial that converted to paid on November 28th with confirmation code CNF-9021-RX.
174. Absolutely absolutely I'm processing that cancellation right now and your cancellation number is going to be CAN-4485-TD and that'll take effect immediately no more charges going forward at all.
175. So here's what I can do for you I'm looking at your usage history and since you haven't accessed any content since... let me find the exact... since December 3rd I'm going to put through a partial refund request RFD-2298-KL for the last three months how does that sound?
176. No no I hear you completely and I'm not just saying this I'm actually... what's the word I'm looking for... escalating this directly to our billing team right now with priority flag PRI-8847-QM so this isn't going into some queue it's getting handled today.
177. Of course of course and I'm sending you an email confirmation right now to the address on file with all these reference numbers the cancellation CAN-4485-TD the refund RFD-2298-KL everything documented so you have proof of this conversation.
178. Um so the refund typically takes about... what's the normal... three to five business days but with the priority flag I added it should be more like one to two days maximum and you'll get a separate email with confirmation code RFN-3392-BX when it processes.
179. Hey absolutely that's what I'm here for and honestly if you have any issues at all with the refund not showing up you can reference ticket TKT-6621-LP and ask for me directly I'll make sure this gets sorted for you no matter what.
180. You're so welcome and just to confirm everything one more time subscription SUB-7724-MP is cancelled as of today December 15th refund request RFD-2298-KL is processing for ninety dollars and you should see that within forty-eight hours is there anything else I can help you with today?
181. Got it, um, absolutely can help with that. So I'm just gonna, uh, need to verify your account first and then we can... Let me pull up account ACC-7829-VK here.
182. Right right, so um, I see your billing date here is, uh, the fifteenth which is tomorrow, and um, we can definitely get that updated but I just need to... Can you verify the last four of the current card ending in 8842?
183. Perfect, um, so here's the thing—and I want to be clear about this—any changes made today will, uh, they'll process but might not... The system takes up to twenty-four hours to fully update, reference number REF-90512-TL.
184. I understand the timing concern, and um, that's weird actually because I'm seeing your account type is, uh, premium which should have... Let me check something here in billing code BLL-4429-X.
185. Okay so, hmm, interesting—your account actually has, um, an expedited update flag that I didn't see at first, transaction capability TXN-885214, which means we can... This should process within two hours actually.
186. Yeah so um, let me get those new card details from you and we'll, uh, push this through the expedited channel right away and...
187. Got those, and um, expiration date and, uh, the three-digit code on the back when you're ready...
188. Perfect perfect, so I'm entering this now under update request UPD-7763-MK and, hmm, the system is... Yeah it's accepting it, should be active by, um, let's see, three PM your time.
189. Absolutely, and um, you'll get a confirmation email to, uh, the address on file with confirmation number CNF-992510-B in about, hmm, five minutes or so and then another when it's fully processed...
190. No problem at all! Your account ACC-7829-VK is, um, all set for tomorrow's billing and, uh, if you need anything else or if that confirmation doesn't come through, just reference ticket TKT-445891 and we can...
191. Oh wow, um, I actually—I actually used to drive for the district before this job, so I totally, uh, I totally get how frustrating the payment system is. Let me just, um, pull up your account here, what's your employee ID?
192. No worries at all, take your time. I remember I'd always mix those up too, you know?
193. Perfect, okay okay, so that's ID 52739 and I can see, um, I can see your file right here. You're with, uh, Jefferson County district, route 84?
194. So, um, I'm looking at your payment schedule here and, uh, yeah there's definitely—there's definitely something off. Your last payment, um, it shows as processed with reference number PAY-88429-QJ on the 15th but, hmm, never actually deposited.
195. Oh god, I know, I know, that phone tree is, um, it's honestly terrible. We've all complained about it. So what I'm gonna do is, uh, I'm gonna escalate this directly to payroll with priority code PRI-7264-ML, okay?
196. Yeah! Um, three years actually, before my back gave out. Elementary routes mostly, so like, you know, the really chaotic ones where they're all, uh, they're all screaming and throwing things.
197. Absolutely, and, um, I remember that panic when my direct deposit failed once right before rent was due. So here's what I'm—I'm putting through an emergency payment request, reference EMP-90331-TK, which should, um, it should hit your account within 24 hours.
198. Well, I mean, I sort of know which buttons to push, you know? The system shows, um, it shows you've never had a late payment yourself in, hmm, eight years of service, so this is clearly, uh, clearly their mistake.
199. I'm also, um, I'm also adding a note here with case number CSE-44892-BN that any—any late fees from this should be waived. And honestly? Between you and me, payroll has been, uh, they've been messing up a lot lately.
200. No no no, definitely not you. I've processed, um, probably fifteen similar cases just this week. Your confirmation number for everything is CNF-77205-XP, and um, you can actually call me directly at extension 4429 if the payment doesn't show up tomorrow, okay? Skip that whole awful menu.
201. Oh honey, that's either the universe's twisted sense of humor or a sign you should absolutely jump! Either way, at least this time when he lets you down, you'll have a parachute.
202. Terminal velocity and romantic tension—what a combo! Look, if he's explaining physics while flirting, at least he's multitasking efficiently, though I'd personally prefer full focus on the not-dying part.
203. That's what the automatic activation device is for—it's basically your mechanical therapist that pulls the cord at 750 feet whether you're contemplating existence or just screaming your head off!
204. Death is also possible eating gas station sushi, but at least with skydiving you get an incredible view! Plus, statistically you're more likely to die driving here than jumping out of that perfectly good airplane.
205. Because "adequately maintained flying death trap" doesn't look as good on the brochures! But seriously, these planes are inspected more often than most people floss their teeth.
206. Oh that's, [curious] actually, hilarious! You know, insurance agents are basically professional pessimists, so if they're panicking, er, you're probably doing something right with your life.
207. We're still on the ground, sweetie, so, um, I'm gonna go with terror! But hey, honestly, dizziness means you're breathing, which is, you know, already better than half the first-timers who forget that part entirely.
208. Natural falling form! That's either the world's weirdest pickup line or genuinely impressive—most people look like startled starfish their first time, flailing around like they're fighting invisible ninjas.
209. Classic move! Nothing says "I'm a professional" like turning safety instructions into a fitness modeling session, though I admit the arch is crucial for not spinning like a tumble dryer.
210. Oh honey, well, at this point, I mean, why not add another variable to this chaos? Actually, the good news is, you know, you'll be falling so fast you won't have time to get motion sick—gravity's funny that way!
211. Ends? Oh, I don't think so. See, um, you walked into my world, remember? You wanted this—begged for it, actually. You don't get to just, you know, decide when it's over.
212. I hear everything. Every breath you take, every, er, [sneeze] excuse me—every lie you tell yourself. Here's the thing: you need me more than you're willing to admit.
213. Dangerous? Baby, we haven't even [smiling speaking] scratched the surface of dangerous. What we have? It's rare. It's electric. And you're a fool if you think you can just walk away.
214. I hear someone who's [warm] terrified of feeling something real. You think running back to your safe little life will make this disappear? That hunger in your eyes when you look at me?
215. Stop? After everything we've built together? After I showed you who you really are beneath all that polished exterior? No. We're just getting started, sweetheart.
216. Own you? No, no, no. I don't, well, own you—I've awakened you. There's a difference, you know? And deep down, in that place you're afraid to look, actually, you know I'm right.
217. Simple? Nothing about us has ever been simple. From the second our eyes met, you knew this would consume us both. Don't insult me by pretending otherwise.
218. Or what? You'll call for help? Go ahead. Tell them, um, everything. Explain how you, I mean, invited me in. How you basically craved every moment of this.
219. Advantage? I gave you everything you were too afraid to take for yourself. Power. Passion. Purpose. And now you want to throw it all away because what—it got too real?
220. Sick? Maybe. But so are you, sweetheart. The difference is, well, I embrace it. I mean, you're still pretending, you know, that you can go back to who you were before me.
221. Oh this? Yeah, it's the last one with the golden gate bridge inside. I've been hunting for this specific model for three years now. Pretty pathetic hobby, I know.
222. Wait, seriously? You collect snow globes [crying while speaking] too? Sorry, I'm getting emotional—my grandmother started my collection before she passed, and nobody ever understands why they matter so much.
223. That's incredible! I've never met another, well, serious collector in person. Most people think it's, er, childish or whatever. Do you, like, have a system for displaying them?
224. Shut up! I literally just installed, um, LED strips last month! They make the snow sparkle, you know, especially the ones with the iridescent flakes.
225. The one with the, uh, animated carousel inside? I've been searching for that one for, I mean, forever! You actually have it?
226. You're kidding me! I would, honestly, do anything—well, almost anything—to see those. Here's the thing, I run a vintage collectibles blog and that's basically my holy grail.
227. How do you know about my blog? It only has like three hundred subscribers! Unless... wait, are you SnowGlobeHunter47?
228. This is insane! I always wondered who you were—your comments are, actually, so detailed and, er, helpful. You taught me about checking for, you know, micro-bubbles in the liquid!
229. This is surreal. I'm standing here fighting tears over a snow globe, and I just met my favorite blog commenter in a random San Francisco gift shop.
230. Alex. And you know what? Take this [delighted] snow globe—consider it a gift from one collector to another. We clearly need to grab coffee and talk about that Macys exclusive!
231. Oh god, yeah, that's me! Sorry about all the noise earlier—the movers dropped my couch going up the stairs and it made this horrible scraping sound that probably woke up the entire building. I'm Sarah, by the way.
232. Oh no, I'm so sorry! I had no idea anyone would be sleeping at two in the afternoon—wait, that sounds judgmental, I don't mean it like that. Night shift must be brutal. What do you do?
233. An ER nurse? Jesus, that's— that's intense. My sister's a nurse too, actually, but she does pediatrics which is its own kind of chaos. Look, I'm really really sorry about the noise, um, is there anything I can, like, do to make it up to you?
234. Absolutely, yes, I can totally do that. I work from home anyway so I'll be super quiet—I'm a graphic designer so it's mostly just me and my computer having staring contests all day. No loud music or anything, I promise.
235. No no no, I swear I'm the quietest person ever when I work! Like, my ex used to joke that I turned into a statue—wouldn't move for hours, just totally absorbed. The only sound you'll hear is probably me talking to my cat when I take breaks.
236. Yeah, his name's Meatball! He's this [laugh histerically] enormous orange tabby who thinks he's a dog. He actually plays fetch, I'm not even kidding—throws his toy mouse at my feet and waits for me to toss it back.
237. Right? He earned the name though—he's twenty-two pounds of pure fluff and attitude. But don't worry, he's not a runner or a jumper, mostly just lounges around judging everyone. You like cats?
238. Oh man, I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is just— it's devastating. Charlie sounds like he was special to you. If you ever want to hang out with Meatball, you're totally welcome to come up. He loves attention from literally anyone.
239. Are you kidding? We're neighbors now! Plus you're saving lives at the ER while I'm just making logos for craft breweries—least I can do is share my therapeutic chunky boy. Fair warning though, he drools when he's happy.
240. Whenever you want! And hey, seriously, if you ever need someone to, like, grab groceries or whatever when you're doing those [laugh histerically] brutal shifts, just knock. I mean, we night-shift-adjacent people, sort of, gotta stick together, right?
241. Yeah, I know, um, that was rough. Look, I get that everyone's frustrated about losing three games in a row, but the way some people were, you know, talking to each other out there—that's not who we are as a team, honestly.
242. Right, so, I saw that whole thing go down, and actually, James was out of line. But Tyler throwing his helmet? That's not acceptable either, you know? We're supposed to be setting an example for the JV kids who were watching us practice today, basically.
243. The thing is, pressure's part of the game, right? I've been captain for two years now and, hmm, I've seen teams fall apart over less. But I've also seen teams, like, pull together when it matters most—we just need to figure out which one we want to be, honestly.
244. Absolutely. Remember sophomore year when we were, uh, dead last going into October? We ended up making it to regionals because we stopped fighting each other and, well, started fighting for each other instead. That's what made the difference, you know?
245. Marcus was good, yeah, but actually, you're selling yourself short here. You've scored more goals this season than he did that entire year, I mean, the stats don't lie. It's just that, um, nobody's playing as a unit right now, you know?
246. First, we're having a team meeting tomorrow, and everyone's going to [angry] air their grievances properly, not by throwing equipment around like, err, toddlers. Then we're doing trust exercises—yeah I know they're cheesy but, honestly, this team needs to remember we're supposed to have each other's backs.
247. Hey, I did the same thing with the volleyball team last year when they asked me to help out, and um, they went from constant drama to winning districts. Sometimes you need to, like, get back to basics and remember why you started playing in the first place, you know?
248. And what about now? Because I watch you out there during practice when you think no one's looking, and uhh, you light up when you nail a perfect shot. That's not about your dad anymore—that's all you, I mean, that joy is real, actually.
249. That's what being captain taught me, you know? Half this job is, basically, helping people see what they can't see in themselves. You're one of our strongest players, but more importantly, err, the younger kids look up to you—they need to see you believing in this team.
250. Thanks. Now quit flirting and help me figure out how to get James and Tyler to actually talk to each other tomorrow without starting World War Three—I'm thinking we make them lead the trust fall exercise together.
251. Well, yeah, I mean, I said that but honestly I might have been a bit dramatic about it. We're not falling apart or anything, it's just that, um, sometimes I feel like we're roommates who happen to share a bed, you know?
252. Right so, doing grocery shopping and watching TV while scrolling on our phones isn't exactly, uhh, what I'd call quality time. Remember when we used to, I guess, plan actual dates? Like that time we got lost trying to find that waterfall and ended up at that weird diner instead?
253. Exactly my point—we haven't done anything spontaneous in, well, forever basically. Every weekend it's the same routine, and I mean, I love routine but sometimes I miss when you'd surprise me with random adventures, you know?
254. Wait, hold on. I said that maybe twice when we were literally broke after buying the couch, but you took it as some permanent veto on fun.
255. The concert was because my mom was in the hospital, and the coast trip was during that huge storm, remember? Those weren't about not wanting to do things with you.
256. The thing is, relationships don't just flow forever on their own, right? My sister told me, uhh, and I thought she was being preachy but actually, she said love is like a garden—ignore it and, well, even the strongest plants will wither.
257. Okay so, fair point, but honestly, maybe that's exactly why she knows what she's talking about. She learned the hard way what happens when you, like, take someone for granted and, basically, stop putting in the work.
258. No! God, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying we caught this early enough to fix it, to reconnect before we drift too far apart.
259. Really? Because last time you tried to cook, well, the smoke alarm went off three times and, hmm, we ended up ordering pizza anyway, remember that disaster?
260. You know what? Let's cook it together—that way if we, uhh, burn the kitchen down at least we'll [pause] have fun doing it, and honestly, that's kind of the whole point anyway, right?
261. Well, I mean, last I [confidently] checked it was, you know, hovering around like 3.9 percent. It's basically harder to get into than winning a small lottery at this point.
262. Honestly, that's the heartbreaking part—er, these days perfect scores aren't enough because, the thing is, everyone applying has perfect scores. They're looking for something undefinable, hmm, like a specific kind of spark.
263. Universities want students who'll [warm] change the world somehow. They need evidence you've already started doing something extraordinary, not just gotten good grades.
264. It means something, but [very loudly] NOT ENOUGH! You need valedictorian plus Olympic medals plus a nonprofit plus published research.
265. Exactly! The whole system has spiraled into this arms race where seventeen-year-olds are burning out before they even start college.
266. Oh god, the interviews are, like, [very loudly] THE WORST PART because, uhh, you have maybe twenty minutes to, basically, justify your entire existence!
267. Hmm, they claim they want authenticity but, it's just that, everyone's so coached now that, well, genuine responses sound unprepared. Kids hire consultants who teach them how to, sort of, fake being authentic.
268. The saddest part is seeing brilliant kids think they're failures because they only got into their safety schools. Like getting into UCLA is somehow a consolation prize now.
269. It's definitely escalating. Some parents are literally planning their kids' extracurriculars from kindergarten now, mapping out a fifteen-year strategy.
270. Completely serious, and the thing is, these parents are, uhh, spending hundreds of thousands on, you know, "enrichment" before college even starts. It's actually become an entire industry feeding off parental anxiety.
271. You have no idea how exhausting it was today. We spent three hours debating the font choice for a PowerPoint that nobody's actually going to read, and then Jenkins made us role-play customer scenarios.
272. Oh it gets worse. I had to pretend to be an angry millennial who couldn't figure out our app interface while Brad from accounting critiqued my "authenticity" and took notes on a clipboard.
273. The very same. And then during lunch, [cry loudly] Patricia announced they're implementing "Waffle Wednesdays" as a morale booster, as if carbs could somehow fix our broken souls.
274. Okay so, you're not wrong but, umm, the workshops at least didn't require us to, basically, share our "waffle gratitude" in a circle afterwards. Yes, that's a real thing they're planning.
275. I wish I was joking but, well, there's already a sign-up sheet for who's bringing, you know, different toppings each week. I got assigned, hmm, whipped cream duty for week three.
276. As tempting as that [short pause] sounds, one of us needs health insurance and a steady paycheck. Your van doesn't even have working air conditioning, and summer's coming.
277. I did say that, and it's [very melancholic] probably true, but soul death comes with a 401k match and dental coverage. Plus someone has to pay for your artisanal coffee habit and those expensive climbing shoes you keep buying.
278. Forty whole dollars? Well then, let me just submit my resignation tomorrow and we'll retire on your musical fortune. Should I tell Patricia we won't be needing her waffles after all?
279. You're not wrong, but life's also too short to spend it wondering how we'll pay rent next month. Though I'll admit, sometimes when Jenkins is droning on about synergy, I fantasize about your van life idea.
280. Hold that thought, err, let me grab some wine first because, honestly, if I'm going to, like, dream about escaping corporate hell, I want to, well, properly enjoy the fantasy.
281. Twenty-three, forty-seven, sixteen. Don't worry, it's part of my charm! I multitask everywhere, even at milongas. Helps me memorize the quarterly inventory while practicing my ochos.
282. So, eighty-nine, twelve, actually, thirty-one. I mean, where else can you combine Argentine passion with supply chain management? My therapist says it's a healthy coping mechanism for work stress.
283. Honestly, two hundred and six, uhh, ninety-four. She basically encouraged it after I told her about my spreadsheet nightmares. Dancing helps the numbers flow more naturally, if that makes any sense.
284. Fifty-five, seventy-two. My ex-wife would definitely agree with you there. Though she never appreciated how soothing industrial cataloging can be when set to Piazzolla.
285. Hmm, one hundred and [delighted] eight, you see, forty-three! No no, the marriage ended for normal reasons. The number thing just made custody hearings more interesting.
286. Okay so, sixty-seven, really, ninety-nine, err, twenty-one. Just let the numbers wash over you like waves. They're actually in three-quarter time if you listen carefully.
287. Thirty-three, [confidently] eighty-eight, four hundred and two. Twenty years of tango lessons will do that, plus the numbers help me maintain perfect timing between component deliveries and passionate embraces.
288. Ah, that's ball bearings per cubic meter, it's just that, different scale entirely. Right so, seventeen, nine, one fifty-six. See how naturally it flows with the music?
289. Ooh, twenty-seven, [excited] actually, eighteen! You know what's surreal? Like, finding someone willing to dance with the weird manufacturer guy who counts inventory at milongas.
290. Anyway, forty-nine, hmm, seventy-three. I mean, that's the nicest thing anyone's said to me since my quality control team called me "tolerably eccentric" last Tuesday.
291. Well, spiritual leadership is actually about, [sniffle], leading from a place of authenticity and inner wisdom, er, rather than just positional authority. It requires understanding that true influence comes from serving others' highest potential, not from controlling them.
292. Absolutely! Traditional management focuses on metrics, deliverables, and hierarchical structures. Spiritual leadership recognizes that people aren't just resources—they're whole beings with souls, dreams, and untapped wisdom waiting to emerge.
293. Think of it this way: a spiritual leader creates sacred space for transformation. They ask questions like "What wants to emerge through us?" instead of "How do we hit our targets?" It's about collective evolution, not just achievement.
294. You'd be surprised how practical it actually is! When people feel seen and valued at a soul level, their creativity explodes. Studies show that purpose-driven organizations outperform profit-driven ones by 400% over ten years.
295. The research comes from firms like Deloitte and McKinsey, actually. When employees connect their work to something transcendent, engagement skyrockets. They're not just earning paychecks—they're participating in something meaningful, something larger than themselves.
296. So they might start meetings with, hmm, moments of silence or gratitude circles, [quickly], actually, some use contemplative practices like walking meditation between sessions. It's about creating rituals that, you know, remind everyone we're more than just our job titles.
297. The most successful companies in the world are already doing this! Google has mindfulness programs, Patagonia makes decisions based on environmental dharma, and Microsoft's CEO transformed the culture through empathy and growth mindset principles.
298. It starts with deep inner work—meditation, self-reflection, shadow integration. You can't guide others through transformation you haven't experienced yourself. Most spiritual leaders spend years developing their consciousness before they're ready to hold space for collective awakening.
299. Not at all! Spiritual leadership is completely secular and inclusive. It draws from wisdom traditions worldwide—Buddhist mindfulness, indigenous council practices, Sufi poetry, quantum physics—but requires no specific belief system, just openness to mystery and interconnection.
300. That awareness itself is the beginning of transformation! Most people sleepwalk through their careers, but recognizing that emptiness means you're ready for something deeper. The soul always knows when it's time to evolve beyond mere survival into purposeful contribution.
301. Well, I'm actually, you know, kind of a morning person, so I usually get here before the chaos starts. I mean, it's nice when the office is quiet like this, don't you think?
302. I totally get that! Um, I'm Sarah by the way, just started here last week in, er, the marketing department. Still finding my way around this maze of cubicles, honestly.
303. Nice to meet you, James! So, [very quietly], what department are you in? I've been trying to, like, map out who's who, but there are, hmm, so many people here it's kind of overwhelming.
304. That must keep you busy! Actually, I've been having, er, some issues with my laptop that, well, maybe you could help with when you have time?
305. It keeps freezing when I open, um, more than three applications at once, and honestly, the screen flickers sometimes too. The thing is, I need multiple programs running for design work.
306. Oh that sounds, [sad], expensive to fix, doesn't it? I mean, I just started and, like, I don't want to already be requesting new equipment, you know?
307. Really? That's such a relief! So, how do I, actually, go about requesting that? Is there, I guess, some kind of form or process I should follow?
308. You'd do that for me? That's incredibly kind! Here's the thing though, I don't even know where to, hmm, find the asset number on this thing.
309. I'll check when I get back to my desk then. Hey, um, do you always eat lunch alone? I mean, I noticed you usually sit by yourself in the cafeteria.
310. Fair enough, I totally [groan] understand needing that recharge time. Well, if you ever want quiet company though, someone who won't expect constant chatter, I'm pretty good at comfortable silence myself.
311. Oh, well, longer than you'd think, actually. I've been, you know, developing this particular algorithm for about three years now, and honestly, it's gotten quite good at identifying specific individuals.
312. It can map vocal patterns, analyze micro-tremors, detect emotional states. More importantly, it can tell when someone's lying with 94% accuracy.
313. The thing is, most people don't realize, hmm, how much their voice reveals about them. I mean, every inflection, every pause, it's all data that basically tells me who you really are.
314. Privacy is an outdated concept when national security is at stake. Your conversation patterns, for instance, have been quite revealing tonight.
315. Haven't you though? Actually, your stress markers spiked, [laugh hard], er, three times during our conversation. The thing is, innocent people don't usually show those patterns, you know?
316. Threatening? No no, I'm [excited] simply, um, demonstrating capabilities! You see, honestly, your vocal signature matches someone we've been, sort of, looking for.
317. Software developer, yes. But also, [whispering], someone who, well, accessed classified databases last Tuesday at, I guess, 2:47 AM. The voice print is, actually, undeniable.
318. Mistakes are, hmm, rare in my line of work. Here's the thing, we can do this quietly, or, you know, I can make some calls and, er, things get complicated.
319. Lawyers won't help with the evidence I have. Your voice just confirmed everything I needed to know about your involvement.
320. Frame? Oh no, I'm not, actually, framing anyone. The thing is, your voice already convicted you, and, honestly, there's nowhere left to run now.
321. Oh, um, I've been helping startups, you know, figure out their content voice and basically build authentic connections with their audiences. It's really rewarding work.
322. Well, I start by actually listening to [upset] what the founders are, I guess, passionate about. Then we find ways to translate that passion into content that resonates.
323. Hmm, absolutely! The thing is, many founders try to sound corporate when really their audience wants genuine human connection and real stories.
324. They focus on selling instead of [laugh] storytelling! People connect with narratives, not sales pitches dressed up as blog posts.
325. Usually about six to eight weeks for the foundation. But the beautiful part is watching it evolve as the company grows and learns more about their audience.
326. Ah, I've worked with Bloom & Co, that sustainable fashion brand, and kind of helped them triple their engagement. It's just that their story was already amazing, they just needed help telling it.
327. Oh honestly, that makes me [cough] so happy! Umm, they were incredible to work with, right so, passionate about their mission and open to experimenting.
328. Beyond the usual engagement rates, I look at conversation quality. Are people sharing personal stories in the comments? That's when you know you've struck a chord.
329. Exactly! Err, likes are vanity metrics, you know? What basically matters is whether you're building a community that cares about what you're doing.
330. Actually, stop trying to be perfect! I think the best content, you see, comes when err you're vulnerable and share what honestly excites or challenges you.
331. Most gratitude practices are backwards! Instead of forcing yourself to list things you're grateful for, I teach people to notice micro-moments of appreciation throughout their day organically.
332. Traditional journaling becomes a chore, another item on your to-do list. My method integrates gratitude into your natural thought patterns so it becomes automatic, like breathing.
333. Well, instead of writing [deep pitch] "I'm grateful for my coffee," um, you actually pause when you're, I mean, drinking it and notice the warmth spreading through your body.
334. It bridges meditation and daily life! You're training your brain to catch these fleeting moments of goodness that we usually rush past without acknowledging.
335. Structure can help initially, but honestly, rigid frameworks, uhh, often create resistance. The thing is, when gratitude feels forced, your brain actually starts rejecting the practice.
336. I use something called [frustrated] "gratitude triggers" – everyday actions that prompt awareness. Every doorway you walk through becomes a reminder to notice one thing you appreciate.
337. Exactly! So, your environment becomes your teacher, right? I guess the beautiful part is, umm, you're not adding anything to your day, just basically shifting your awareness.
338. The results are extraordinary, actually. People report, well, feeling lighter within days, and you know, brain scans show increased activity in regions associated with contentment and emotional regulation.
339. Yes! We partnered with [whispering loudly] neuroscientists who, er, discovered that this approach creates, anyway, stronger neural pathways than traditional methods because it's linked to sensory experience.
340. That's the goal, honestly! You see, when gratitude becomes, uhh, effortless and integrated, it's just that it transforms from a practice into simply how you experience life itself.
341. Oh! Well, the core principle is that our brains aren't designed for abstract information, they evolved to remember stories and spatial relationships. When you transform data into vivid mental images placed in familiar locations, retention jumps from maybe twenty percent to over ninety.
342. Start with your childhood home! Walk through [gasp loudly] it mentally right now—can you see your front door? The thing about memory palaces is they use spaces you already know perfectly, so there's no extra memorization required.
343. Perfect! Now imagine placing [cough] your grocery list items in there—maybe a giant loaf of bread is blocking the sink, eggs are juggling themselves on the counter. The weirder and more emotional the image, the stronger it sticks.
344. Exactly, and here's the thing, uhh, once you practice this for, you know, even a week, your brain starts doing it automatically, basically creating these associations without conscious effort anymore.
345. Yes! After a while, [smiling speaking] information just, sort of, attaches itself to locations, and honestly, you'll find yourself accidentally memorizing things you didn't even intend to remember, which is actually pretty wild.
346. Oh that never happens! So, you can use, well, any space you know—your commute route, you know, favorite restaurants, even video game maps, and anyway, you can also layer multiple sets of information in the same palace.
347. Think of it like, um, having different colored overlays, right? So Monday's presentation goes in your house with, basically, red-tinted images, Tuesday's shopping list uses blue, and honestly, your brain keeps them completely separate.
348. Precisely! Before printing, this was [sleepily] how all knowledge was preserved, and monks would spend years building elaborate cathedral-sized memory palaces containing thousands of texts.
349. I memorized all of Shakespeare's sonnets [gasp] last year! It took three months, but now I can recite any of them backwards, forwards, or even just the third word of every line if you wanted.
350. Start small, that's perfect! Actually, even memorizing ten items will, uhh, show you how powerful this is, and the thing is, once you experience that first success, well, you'll be completely hooked on the technique.
351. That's brilliant! Just like a good DJ reads the crowd and adjusts the energy, your portfolio needs to respond to market conditions while maintaining its core rhythm. The key is having different asset classes that complement each other, creating this beautiful financial symphony.
352. Watch the bass drops! When markets get volatile, that's your cue to rebalance, just like when the crowd's energy shifts and the DJ transitions from house to techno. You want to maintain your target percentages, typically rebalancing quarterly or when any asset class moves more than five percent from its target.
353. Hey, that's like getting burned by a bad remix—it happens to everyone! The trick isn't avoiding risk entirely, it's understanding which risks are worth taking. Think sixty percent stocks, thirty percent bonds, ten percent alternatives, adjusting based on your age and when you need the money.
354. Absolutely! Create an investment policy statement, your setlist if you will, that defines your goals, risk tolerance, and rebalancing triggers. This becomes your North Star when the market drops sick beats or goes silent, keeping you from making impulsive moves.
355. Index funds are [cheerful] like the main stage headliners—reliable, consistent, low-cost performers! They give you instant diversification across hundreds or thousands of companies, and studies show they outperform about ninety percent of actively managed funds over ten-year periods.
356. Well, not quite everything, you know, because even the best festival needs, umm, variety across stages, and honestly, you want some bonds for stability, maybe international exposure for, actually, better diversification.
357. Target-date funds are [shaky voice] fantastic for beginners, though they can be a bit conservative! They automatically shift from stocks to bonds as you approach retirement, like a DJ gradually lowering the BPM as sunrise approaches, ensuring you don't lose everything right when you need it.
358. The best time to start was yesterday, the second best is today! Even starting with fifty dollars a month in a diversified fund beats waiting for the perfect moment. Compound interest is like that building drop—it starts slow but becomes absolutely massive over time.
359. Robo-advisors are phenomenal for [crying while speaking] hands-off investing—they handle rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, everything! They're like having a personal DJ who knows exactly when to mix tracks, charging only about 0.25% annually compared to traditional advisors' one to two percent fees.
360. Remember, the market's always playing, whether you're dancing or sitting out! Start simple with a three-fund portfolio—domestic stocks, international stocks, bonds—then add complexity as you learn. Your future self will thank you for joining this financial festival now rather than watching from the sidelines.
361. The Major Arcana perfectly maps to Hersey and Blanchard's [sleepily] situational leadership model, each card representing different readiness levels and corresponding leadership styles. When I pull cards, I'm essentially divining the developmental continuum from D1 through D4, assessing task-relevant maturity against directive and supportive behavior matrices.
362. See this Fool card? It represents your D1 employee—low competence, high commitment, [anxious] requiring S1 directing style with high task behavior! The Emperor embodies S1 leadership perfectly: clear instructions, close supervision, minimal relationship behavior, exactly what Blanchard prescribes for enthusiastic beginners who lack skills.
363. Absolutely! The Hierophant represents, hmm, S2 coaching style for D2 development level, you know, where competence is growing but commitment wavers, so, um, you need high directive AND high supportive behaviors simultaneously. This card signals when leaders must explain decisions while actively listening, creating that crucial psychological safety Edmondson describes.
364. That's classic D3 development level—high competence, variable commitment—requiring S3 supporting style represented by the Star card. You need low task behavior but high relationship behavior, facilitating rather than directing, asking "What do you think?" instead of "Here's what to do."
365. Multiple cards reveal, well, team composition complexity where, basically, you're managing different readiness levels simultaneously, kind of, requiring style flexibility that Goleman calls, err, leadership agility. The spread shows whether you need differentiated leadership—adapting your style person by person—or if there's a dominant collective readiness level.
366. The World card represents S4 delegating style for D4 development level—high competence, high commitment, requiring minimal directive and supportive behaviors. These are your self-sufficient performers who need autonomy, what Pink calls intrinsic motivation through mastery, autonomy, and purpose.
367. The Tower indicates regression along the development continuum, which Blanchard warns about when situational stressors cause competent employees to slide backwards. You must diagnose whether it's temporary performance regression requiring increased support, or fundamental readiness reassessment necessitating style adjustment.
368. Exactly! The Celtic Cross spread maps perfectly to, you know, situational leadership assessment where, basically, position one shows current D-level, position two indicates, um, obstacles to development, and honestly, position six reveals the appropriate S-style intervention. Each position analyzes different variables: competence, commitment, confidence, and motivation—Blanchard's four development factors.
369. Leadership is [friendly] incredibly nuanced, but the cards provide a framework for understanding these complexities! Think of tarot as a projective technique for surfacing unconscious leadership patterns, similar to how assessment centers use simulations to evaluate managerial competencies.
370. Remember, situational leadership isn't about, well, finding one perfect style but, actually, developing style repertoire flexibility that, hmm, responds to follower readiness dynamically, just as, basically, tarot readings shift meaning based on querent context and surrounding cards.
371. Twenty-three years next month. I moved here when this street was nothing but family-owned shops and everyone knew each other's names.
372. Different doesn't even begin to describe it. The bodega where Mr. Chen used to give kids free candy is now a boutique selling forty-dollar candles.
373. Oh god, I knew, sort of, every single person on this [laugh hysterically] block—their kids, their dogs, uhh, even their usual coffee orders! Now I don't recognize a soul walking by.
374. Actually, last week I, err, walked past where [sniffle] Rosa's bakery used to be, and it's just that, it's a CrossFit gym now. She made bread there for thirty-seven years.
375. Sure, but, hmm, this isn't evolution—it's, basically, erasure. Every quirky little place that made this neighborhood special has been, I guess, steamrolled for another glass tower.
376. The jazz club on Third Street [apologetic] haunts me. Sorry, I get emotional about it, but musicians would just show up and play until dawn.
377. Pushed out, one by one. My rent went from eight hundred to three thousand in fifteen years, and I'm barely hanging on.
378. The worst part is how they [cough] market it as "revitalization" when really they're just replacing humans with price tags. Everything here used to have a story.
379. Like, there was this, umm, corner where [belly laugh] Charlie played saxophone, anyway, every Friday for tips. He put three kids through college standing on that corner, and now it's a Starbucks parking lot.
380. Yeah, and he was, you know, brilliant too—could've, uhh, played anywhere [slurring] but he loved this spot. Sorry, I get, basically, a little worked up remembering what we've lost here.
381. Well, um, market intelligence can be valuable, but actually, most companies waste resources chasing every data point when they should focus on, kind of, core metrics that directly impact decision-making. The ROI often doesn't justify the massive spend on comprehensive intelligence platforms.
382. Not necessarily—information overload paralyzes decision-making more than it helps, and companies end up paying for redundant data streams. I've seen organizations spend millions on intelligence that duplicates what they already know from basic customer feedback and sales patterns.
383. Scale back the waste, not the wisdom. Focus on actionable intelligence that answers specific strategic questions rather than broad-spectrum monitoring that generates pretty dashboards nobody actually uses for decisions.
384. Start with free or low-cost sources—industry publications, government data, LinkedIn insights—before investing in expensive platforms. Build internal capability to analyze what you have before buying more data; most companies are data-rich but insight-poor.
385. Competitive intelligence is, hmm, often overvalued because companies [yawn] obsess over competitors instead of customers, basically wasting resources tracking every competitor move. Focus on customer intelligence first—understanding their evolving needs delivers better ROI than paranoid competitor-watching.
386. Most consultants profit from complexity, but, uh, the thing is, effective intelligence is about simplicity and focus, like knowing which three metrics actually predict market shifts. Companies need intelligence discipline, not intelligence sprawl.
387. AI tools are, uhh, seductive but [very loudly] it's just that they often automate bad intelligence practices at scale! Without clear intelligence requirements and human judgment, AI just produces faster, more expensive noise that looks sophisticated but adds little value.
388. Good! Question every intelligence investment through this lens: Will this help us make a specific decision better or faster? If the answer isn't immediately clear, it's probably intelligence theater, not intelligence value.
389. Three things: clear intelligence requirements tied to decisions, not curiosity; systematic collection from diverse but focused sources; and rigorous analysis that challenges assumptions. Most companies fail because they collect everything, analyze nothing, and decide based on gut anyway.
390. Track decision velocity and accuracy, not data volume collected—umm, the best intelligence operations, well, improve decision speed by 30% while actually reducing information processing time. Quality intelligence makes decisions easier, not harder.
391. Oh, that's wonderful that you're exploring sync! Actually, it's one of the most rewarding ways for independent artists to, kind of, get their music heard while earning sustainable income, and honestly, the timing couldn't be better with all the content being created nowadays.
392. Every successful sync artist started with that [laugh histerically] exact same doubt! Your music doesn't need to be chart-topping; it needs to evoke emotion and serve storytelling, which is a completely different and equally valuable skill set.
393. Not at all! Um, some of the most successful sync placements come from unknown artists because, basically, music supervisors are looking for fresh sounds that haven't been overexposed, you know? Your uniqueness is actually your biggest asset in this space.
394. Start by organizing your catalog and creating instrumental versions—err, most placements actually need instrumentals, and well, having both versions doubles your opportunities! Then research sync libraries that align with your genre; there are so many welcoming communities ready to help newcomers.
395. Oh, I completely understand that feeling, and rejection in sync is never personal—it's about fit and timing. Every successful sync artist has dozens of rejection stories; the key is finding the right homes for your music where it truly belongs.
396. Absolutely! So, persistence in sync is everything because, hmm, [trailing off] the right placement might be... well, just one submission away. I've seen artists get their biggest placements after years of patience, and those early rejections often lead to better opportunities later.
397. Every genre has opportunities! Actually, the key is authentic emotion—whether it's, kind of, an intimate acoustic piece or an epic orchestral track, um, music supervisors need songs that enhance their stories. Your genuine artistic voice is what makes your music valuable for sync.
398. Sync is definitely a long game, but the beautiful thing is that once your music starts placing, it can generate income for years! Some tracks become sync favorites and get used repeatedly across different projects, creating wonderful passive income streams.
399. You'll know you're on track when you start getting, um, [animated] specific feedback from libraries or supervisors—even constructive criticism means they're, actually, paying attention! Small wins like library acceptances or brief holds are all signs you're moving in the right direction.
400. Here's the thing, the real secret is, well, [very quietly] consistency and authenticity always win—keep creating, keep submitting, and, honestly, trust that your unique voice will find its place in someone's story.
401. [clinical] The hemline needs to be precisely, [measured], fourteen inches from the floor for royal protocol.
402. [cold] My job is to ensure you look appropriate for, [exact], marrying into the royal family. [pause]
403. The sleeve length, well, requires adjustment by, [precise], three-quarters of an inch, and um, the bodice needs, [steady], restructuring to meet court standards, so, [detached], please remain still.
404. [whispered] Um, well, I—
405. [barely audible] I mean, um, please—
406. [cracking] I've dressed, um, hundreds of brides but, [trembling], watching you transform into royalty when I, well, couldn't even give you, [breaking], proper shoes as a child is—
407. [anguished] Every measurement I take, um, reminds me of, [shattered], how small you were when I, well, walked away believing you'd have, [choking], a better life without me, I mean, without my failures.
408. [defensive] I clawed my way from, [fierce], nothing to this position through twenty years of, [proud], perfect work never making a single, [exact], mistake except the one that mattered most. [cries softly]
409. [resigned] Your train needs to be carried by, [mechanical], six attendants according to tradition. [long pause]
410. [sobbing] Elizabeth, my beautiful, [overwhelmed], Elizabeth, you look exactly like, [tender], I always dreamed you would, [breaking], standing here in white lace. [collapses]
411. [calm] Just doing research.
412. [quiet] Um, they're pretty clear. [pause]
413. [informed] Actually, um, those endowments were, [careful], funded directly from sugar plantations in Jamaica that, well, your ancestors operated using, [measured], enslaved labor from 1742 to 1834, I mean, the ledgers are quite specific.
414. [firm] Um, it does though. [sighs]
415. [grateful] Well, um, your great-great-grandfather's journals that you, [steady], donated to our library actually helped me, er, understand the full scope of what, [emotional], happened to those 847 people your family owned, so, you know, thank you for that.
416. Um, the truth isn't a weapon, it's just, [patient], the truth, and, well, those people deserve to have their, [reverent], stories told after being silenced for, I mean, nearly two hundred years. [quietly]
417. [thoughtful] Maybe that's because, um, real social progress means, [firm], confronting uncomfortable truths about how, well, wealth and power were, [determined], actually accumulated in this country, you know? [pause]
418. [informed] Professor Hartley already reviewed my research and, [proud], signed off on it because the documentation is, [confident], irrefutable and academically significant.
419. [grateful] Nothing, actually, because your donation gave me, [sincere], everything I needed to tell their stories properly and that's, [peaceful], all I ever wanted. [softly]
420. [gentle] Um, actually, well, no.
421. [knowing] I've been watching your yacht make these, [deliberate], midnight runs through this channel for three months now, and the fog, [measured], always seems to roll in just when you're passing through the, [pointed], restricted zones.
422. [interrupting] The Bellefonte's hull modifications aren't for, [careful], stability in rough seas, they're for carrying extra cargo that doesn't, [direct], appear on any manifest. [pause]
423. [steady] Your great-grandfather ran rum during Prohibition using the, [historical], same hidden compartments, your father ran guns to Cuba in the, [knowing], sixties, and now here you are, [accusatory], continuing the family tradition.
424. [confident] The proof is currently being documented by my team who boarded your, [satisfied], yacht fifteen minutes ago while you were, [calculated], distracted by our conversation here on this, [gesturing], conveniently foggy pier.
425. [calm] Maritime law gives us authority to board any vessel that's, [legal], run aground in protected waters, especially when there's, [emphatic], reasonable suspicion of smuggling activity.
426. Well, um, honor doesn't mean much when you're moving, [disgusted], fentanyl through fishing villages where kids are, I mean, dying every week.
427. [grim] We found the vacuum-sealed packages hidden in your, [precise], modified ballast tanks. [sighs]
428. [weary] Um, the fog's lifting now and you can see the, [pointing], patrol boats surrounding your yacht, so I mean, [sympathetic], your family's smuggling legacy ends tonight, one way or, [final], another. [pause]
429. [matter-of-fact] It always does, [reflective], and what's hidden in the darkness becomes clear in the, [solemn], light. [footsteps approaching]
430. [relieved] That's wise.
431. [confused] Wait, what do you mean it's not recognized anymore? I literally just— [pause] I spent eighteen months on this certification. Um, the state board said it was, like, the gold standard for archery technicians. [frustrated] So now they're telling me that, what, it's basically worthless? [sarcastic] Oh that's great, that's really fantastic. I mean, I turned down that job at the sporting goods store because, you know, I wanted to focus on getting certified properly. [bitter] And honestly, the amount of money I spent on those workshops— [groan] God, it was like three thousand dollars just for the compound bow module alone. [very quietly] I can't believe this is happening. Er, maybe there's some kind of grandfather clause or, I don't know, something where existing certifications still count? [anxious] The thing is, I already told my family I was starting my own shop next month. [laugh] This is so stupid. Like, how does a certification just stop being valid? [angry] They can't just change the rules after people have already— [trailing off] I mean... [sigh] Okay so, hmm, maybe I can transfer it to another state? [desperately hopeful] Actually wait, Minnesota might still recognize it, right? [mumbling] Or I could just, sort of, practice without the official— [pause] No, that's illegal. [very sad] I really thought this was my thing, you know?
432. [warm] God, you know, I remember those first few months after the wedding when Dave would come over and we'd just... sit there. Like, um, neither of us knew what to say. [chuckle] I mean, here's this guy whose daughter I married and we're both trying so hard to—honestly, it was painful. We'd watch TV and, er, make these weird comments about the weather. 

[animated] But then, okay so, remember when I mentioned I was building those shelves? He just lit up! Suddenly he's asking about, you know, what kind of joints I'm using, and I'm like—wait, [excited] you do woodworking too? 

That first time in his workshop though... [trailing off] I mean, the man had tools I'd only seen in catalogs. We spent, hmm, probably six hours just working on this simple jewelry box for Sarah. [smiling speaking] Barely talked at first, but it was different, you know? The awkwardness just... wasn't there anymore. 

[passionately] Now every Sunday we're out there covered in sawdust, arguing about whether dovetails or box joints are better—and honestly, it's like—[pause] I don't know, somewhere between teaching me about grain patterns and, uh, letting me borrow his good chisels, Dave became... [very sincerely] he became my friend. Not just my father-in-law. My actual friend.
433. [bitter] Sarah just called about her five years sober celebration next month and I just... [pause] I mean, I'm happy for her, I really am. [sigh] It's huge, you know? Five years clean, that's—that's incredible. She wants us all there, the whole family, fancy restaurant, the works. 

[anxious] And here I am counting quarters for gas money. Literally. Quarters. We got the foreclosure notice yesterday and I'm supposed to smile and—[frustrated] God, I sound like such a terrible person. She deserves this. She worked so hard, all those meetings, the rehab stays we all pitched in for... 

[crying while speaking] I remember when she hit rock bottom, we were doing okay then, we actually helped with her treatment costs. Now she's thriving, got promoted at work, and we can't even afford to keep our kids in soccer. [pause] The irony is just... 

[very quietly] I want to be there for her, I do. But how do I show up in my one decent outfit left, order water and appetizers, pretend everything's fine? [shaky voice] Maybe I tell her we're sick that day? No, that's—[regretful] she'd know. She always knows. 

[exhausted] I'm proud of her, um, I really am. It's just... timing, you know? Life's timing is so cruel sometimes.
434. Twenty-three years I've been working in that greenhouse, and finally—finally they give me the promotion. [bitter] The email came through this morning, right after Sarah texted about the lawyer. I mean, how's that for timing? [laugh] God, it's like the universe has this twisted sense of humor, you know?

I should be, um, celebrating right now. [confused] Manager. Greenhouse manager. That's what I've wanted since—honestly, since forever. But I'm just sitting here in my car, and uh, I can't even call anyone because who would I—[shaky voice] Sarah was supposed to be the first person I told about stuff like this. 

[sigh] The thing is, maybe if this had happened six months ago, we could've—no, that's not fair. It wasn't about the money. Well, not entirely about the money. [whispering] She said I cared more about those plants than our marriage. And maybe she was—I don't know, maybe she had a point.

[exhausted] So yeah, I got the promotion. Thirty percent raise, my own office with a view of the orchid section, everything I worked for. And I'm, like, sleeping on my brother's couch. [cry] How do you even process that? The best news and the worst news all at once. [relieved] At least the plants don't ask questions, right? They just... grow.
435. [confused] I keep thinking about what Marcus said to me yesterday. [pause] Twenty years I've been a corrections officer, you know? Twenty years of— [bitter] I thought my job was to make their lives hard. Keep them in line. [slowly] But then this kid, this kid comes in for armed robbery, and I'm ready to just... [trailing off] 

[sigh] Something was different though. [curious] I actually, um, started talking to him. Like really talking. [warm] About his mom, about why he did it, about what he wanted before everything went wrong. [short pause] And I realized— [gasp softly] God, I've been doing this all wrong.

[very sincerely] These past six months, I've been running these circles, these restorative justice circles, and it's like— [excited] people are actually changing! [laugh] The recidivism rate in my block dropped forty percent. Forty! [passionately] I'm not just locking people up anymore, I'm actually— [voice breaking] I'm helping them heal.

[regretful] All those years I wasted being the tough guy. [mumbling] Being the punisher. [empathetically] When really, I mean, what people needed was someone to listen, to help them understand why they— [speeding up] why they hurt others, how to make it right. [relieved] I finally found what I'm actually good at. [chuckle] Who would've thought?
436. Look, I never thought being completely unremarkable would, you know, actually become my thing. [confused] But here I am, right? The spokesperson for, um, regular people's problems. [chuckle] They literally picked me because I'm so... average. My credit score? [monotone] 680. My car? Honda Civic. I mean, [hesitantly] I shop at Target, I forget to floss, and honestly, I still don't understand cryptocurrency. 

[bitter] "Perfectly average Jane," that's what they called me. Like, [pause] at first it kind of stung, you know? [upset] Nobody wants to be told they're basically the human equivalent of beige. But then I thought, well, [warming up] somebody has to speak for us, right? The people who, er, aren't influencers or CEOs or whatever. [passionately] We're the ones dealing with real stuff! Like, why do I need seventeen passwords? [frustrated] Why does my insurance cover everything except what I actually need? And honestly, [speeding up] don't even get me started on self-checkout machines that yell at you about unexpected items—

[sigh] The thing is, being average means I get it. [very sincerely] I really get what most people go through. So yeah, [confidently] maybe being unremarkable is actually my superpower. [laugh] God, that sounds ridiculous.
437. [shaky voice] I'm trapped in the municipal tunnel system under Fifth Street and, um, [crying while speaking], the water's rising faster than I thought it would, I mean, [desperate], I called 911 but they said twenty minutes and I don't think I have that long. [gasp]
438. [whispering] Um, I can't, well, swim.
439. The emergency valve I was fixing broke completely and now, [frustrated], the main water line is flooding everything down here and, [trembling], I can already feel it at my chest. [cough]
440. [loudly] There's a pipe assembly platform about, [hesitantly], ten feet away but I'd have to go underwater to reach it.
441. [relieved] The pipes run along the ceiling and they're, [animated], bolted every three feet so maybe, [slowly], I could use them like monkey bars if I time it right. [deep breath]
442. My kids don't even know I'm, [sad], working overtime tonight because I wanted to surprise them with, [bitter], Christmas presents they actually asked for this year.
443. Um, the water's at my neck now and, well, [terrified], I can hear the sirens but they sound so far away and, er, [whispering loudly], I'm scared of the dark water.
444. I can see the platform now and the water's actually, [surprised], pushing me up toward the pipes and, [determined], maybe this crazy plan will work after all and, [grateful], thank you for not letting me give up. [gasp softly]
445. [shouting] I made it to the platform and, um, [exhausted], the rescue team just broke through the access hatch and, well, [crying], I can see their lights coming down and, I mean, [joyful], I'm going home. [cry]
446. [grateful] When I get out of here I'm coming to, [friendly], shake your hand because you saved my life tonight by, [tearful], just being there when I needed someone most.
447. [passionately] Well, um, exactly.
448. [empathetically] I understand this must feel like an attack on your heritage, but the aquifer beneath us is, [urgent], the last clean water source within fifty miles, and without it, [very quietly], thousands of families will have to relocate. [pause]
449. [warm] Look, I mean, we're not talking about destroying anything—we could, uh, carefully access the water through, [carefully], minimal intervention if you'd let me explain. [gasp softly]
450. [apologetic] I've spent, um, three months mapping the underground streams and, [sincerely], your shop sits directly above the convergence point where, uh, we need to install the filtration system.
451. The contamination is spreading faster than we anticipated and, [desperately], if we don't act within the next two weeks, the damage will be, [very sad], irreversible. [long pause]
452. [gently] Um, I know this feels impossible, but maybe we could find a way to, [hopeful], preserve both your legacy and the town's future, you know?
453. [excited] Wait, you have historical documentation about the water table from the 1920s—that could, [very excited], completely change our approach because we'd know exactly where the original, [quickly], access points were located without any destructive exploration!
454. [animated] If those old construction records show the original spring locations, um, we might be able to, [enthusiastically], use the existing infrastructure that's already there instead of, [speeding up], drilling new access points that would, uh, damage your shop's foundation! [laugh]
455. My colleague is a historical engineer who specializes in, [confidently], translating old European construction documents and converting obsolete, [cheerful], measurement systems to modern standards.
456. [grateful] You know, um, your family's craftsmanship in building around those springs might be, [emotionally], exactly what saves everyone here, and that's, [very sincerely], a legacy worth more than any building could ever be. [deep breath]
457. The last engineer who claimed to have, [bitter], unbreakable restraints ended up with his entire lab, [frustrated], destroyed and his insurance company, [anxious], refusing to cover what they called quote unquote acts of supernatural violence.
458. [stern] Look, um, I've been through seventeen different, [exhausted], containment systems over the past five years and, well, every single one has failed when the transformation really takes hold, you know?
459. [curious] So you're telling me that these black straps can actually, [hesitantly], withstand the kind of force that bent steel bars like, [slowly], they were made of aluminum foil? [sigh]
460. [quietly] You haven't seen what happens when the moon is full and every, [shaky voice], cell in my body tears itself apart and rebuilds into something that doesn't even, [regretful], remember being human. [long pause]
461. [defensive] Yeah well, um, that's because the transformation doesn't just make me, [angry], stronger, it makes me, like, desperate to escape, you know? [groan]
462. [warm] I appreciate that you're actually listening to my concerns instead of just, [relieved], insisting your technology is foolproof like all the others did. [chuckle]
463. [apologetic] Look, um, I don't mean to sound ungrateful because clearly you've put, [sincerely], enormous thought into this design, well, more than anyone else has anyway.
464. [confused] How can you be so certain when you just admitted that this is all, [worried], theoretical and you've never actually tested them against a real transformation?
465. [surprised] Wait, you actually watched hours of footage of me, [trembling], transforming and destroying everything around me just to, [very sincerely], design better restraints? [gasp softly]
466. [hopeful] So, um, when the full moon rises tomorrow night, well, these things might actually, [cautiously], give me the first peaceful transformation I've had in, uh, almost a decade? [deep breath]
467. [quietly] People say that sometimes but trust me, [bitter], you don't know me—I've only been working these docks for about six months now.
468. Well, um, I lived here a long time ago but, [regretful], that was before everything changed, you know, before I had to leave.
469. [defensive] Look, er, I go by Dan now and, well, I really don't want to, [anxious], talk about what happened back then, umm, especially not here. [sigh]
470. [angry] Tommy made his own choice to jump first and I've spent twenty years, [exhausted], replaying that moment wishing I could have stopped him.
471. Well, you know, staying would have meant facing his parents every day and I just, [crying while speaking], couldn't handle seeing their faces knowing I was there, um, knowing I survived when he didn't. [cough]
472. [surprised] She asked about me even after I just, [guilty], disappeared without saying anything to anyone? [laugh]
473. Er, coming back here to work these docks, I mean, [frustrated], it wasn't supposed to lead to this conversation but maybe, [hopeful], maybe I needed to hear it.
474. I, um, don't really do the social thing much anymore but, well, [contemplative], yeah, maybe that wouldn't be the worst idea. [trailing off]
475. [thoughtful] Um, permanent sounds terrifying after running for so long but, well, [vulnerable], this old harbor does feel like home, you know, [softly], even with all the ghosts.
476. [resigned] Um, well, okay then.
477. [bitter] You have exactly thirty seconds to explain why you're, [cold], standing on my doorstep after six months of radio silence.
478. [shocked] Um, you're telling me that, [confused], after they humiliated me in that callback, well, made me wait eight hours just to say, [angry], they went with someone younger, and now they want me to, er, [sarcastic], save their production?
479. [laughing bitterly] They rejected me for being too intense, [frustrated], too method, and now suddenly those same qualities are what they, [quietly], desperately need.
480. [cynical] Six months ago I would have, [passionate], killed for this opportunity.
481. [contemplative] You know what destroyed me wasn't losing the part but watching them, [hurt], celebrate choosing him while I was still, [whispering], standing right there in the room. [long pause]
482. [suspicious] Why should I trust anything, [nervously], they promise when they already proved my talent meant, [dismissive], nothing compared to a younger face?
483. [wavering] The character deserves better than being someone's, [melancholic], second choice even if that someone, [hesitantly], happens to be me.
484. [defensive] Stop trying to manipulate me with, [tired], compliments that should have mattered six months ago.
485. [resigned] Well, um, I suppose there's poetic justice in, [thoughtful], them crawling back, er, but I need to read the revised script first and, like, [calculated], make them wait until eleven fifty-nine for my answer. [chuckle]
486. Fine, send me the contracts but they're, [determined], going to pay for every minute of those six months of, [vindicated], doubt they put me through, and this time, [slow], I'm keeping the costumes. [laugh]
487. [curious] Well, I mean, I'm just here to study how people, [hesitantly], interact with gym equipment for my app design, um, but you're saying you actually experience all that?
488. [surprised] That's actually fascinating from a design perspective because we never, [thoughtfully], consider how objects might accumulate, [empathetically], emotional data from repeated human contact.
489. My whole career has been about designing, [shocked], interfaces but I never thought about how objects become, [regretful], unwilling witnesses to human pain.
490. [warm] So, um, you're basically the most honest, [relieved], interaction anyone has because they don't, [sincerely], perform for you, they just, er, release everything they're holding, well, without filters.
491. [apologetic] I mean, um, I design experiences that are supposed to, [concerned], help people but I'm realizing that, er, sometimes the best help is just being something that, [whispering loudly], doesn't judge or respond. [pause]
492. Well, um, maybe that's what good design really is, [contemplative], creating spaces or objects that can hold what people need to release, I mean, without breaking under the weight.
493. [excited] This completely changes how I think about, [animated], user interaction because the most meaningful exchanges aren't always, [quickly], verbal or visual but these physical, um, emotional transfers between humans and objects.
494. Um, maybe, well...
495. [whispered] I, um, never thought... [long pause]
496. [determined] You're right, and maybe it's time we started, [passionately], designing with the understanding that everything we touch, [slowly], touches us back in ways we never, [very sincerely], imagined possible. [gasp softly]
497. [defensive] Look, um, I was just there for a party, I mean, like I always am, [shifting uncomfortably], nothing more than drinks and dancing.
498. Jesus, umm, you're really going to interrogate me like I'm, [breaking], one of your clients, aren't you, I mean, your own sibling? [laughs bitterly]
499. [desperate] I didn't know the pills were laced, okay, I mean, um, they were just supposed to be, [trembling], party favors like always.
500. You think I don't see their faces every time I, [haunted], close my eyes or that I haven't been, [shaking], sober for the first time in years because I can't, [hoarse], drink this away?
501. [withdrawn] The dealer was military, [quieter], someone high up who's been running parties for, [hollow], years.
502. [scared] Lieutenant Colonel Harrison, um, your commanding officer's golf buddy who, [whispering], supplies half the base. [trembles]
503. [pleading] So what happens to me now, umm, because I can't exactly, [fearful], go back to my apartment knowing what I just told you.
504. You'd really risk your career for me after all the times I've, [guilty], disappointed you and embarrassed the family? [voice breaks]
505. [crying] I'm so tired of running from this, um, from myself, and I mean, maybe testifying is, [hopeful], the first real thing I've done that matters. [sniffles]
506. [resolute] Then let's burn it all down together, um, because those kids deserve, [fierce], justice and maybe, well, I mean, [vulnerable], maybe I deserve a chance to be more than just the family, [breaking], disappointment. [deep breath]
507. [cold] You've been hitting my supply routes for, [calculating], months without even knowing who you were, [amused], stealing from, and now you come here asking for, [incredulous], what exactly?
508. Um, well, ignorance. [laughs darkly]
509. [intrigued] The corporate security forces have been, [thoughtful], getting more aggressive lately, their new predictive algorithms are, [annoyed], cutting into both our profits, and that's, [bitter], bad for business all around.
510. Trust is not something I, um, [skeptical], give freely, especially to someone who's cost me, er, [calculating], roughly three million in lost merchandise, and, well, [harsh], reputation is everything in my world, you know?
511. Hmm, you've been watching them too, I mean, [surprised], closer than I thought, er, which makes you either very smart or, um, very dangerous.
512. [contemplative] Tell me about, um, [curious], their new scanning tech at the port, I mean, the one that caught your crew last week, you know?
513. [impressed] You lost good people but still managed to, [calculating], extract that level of technical detail, which suggests you have, [intrigued], someone on the inside.
514. [decisive] Fine, we'll try this, um, arrangement for one month, but, well, [warning], if you cross me or, er, compromise my operations, you know what happens.
515. [amused] Pretty words from someone who just, [dry], pitched me an alliance based entirely on mutual desperation.
516. [final] We'll see.
517. [defensive] I could ask you the same question since you're supposed to be, [exhausted], at that medical conference in Boston right now.
518. [quietly] Look, um, I need you to just, [hesitantly], walk away and pretend you never saw me here because, well, this isn't what it, [trembling], looks like and I mean, I can't explain right now.
519. [anxious] Well, your sister doesn't know about this and, umm, she can never find out, you know?
520. [monotone] The suit was a gift from a client who wanted me to look, [formal], appropriate for certain social events.
521. [tired] Um, the warehouse laid me off three months ago and, well, [desperate], nobody's hiring former addicts with criminal records, you know?
522. Because, umm, Sarah's already ashamed enough of me without, [crying while speaking], knowing that I'm doing this just to keep our kids in their school and, well, [bored], pay for her mother's cancer treatments, you know? [gasp softly]
523. [coldly] Name one job that pays eight hundred dollars for three hours of work that, um, doesn't require a degree or, [mocking], a clean background check, I mean really. [laugh]
524. [very quietly] I'm already destroyed.
525. [relieved] My last client cancelled which is why I'm standing here alone, [sad], but tomorrow there's a regular who pays my rent for the month in one, [very melancholic], night and I can't afford to say no.
526. [whispering loudly] You don't understand what it's like to fail everyone you, [slowly], love every single day.
527. [frustrated] I can't just abandon three hundred animals to, [shaky voice], die from toxic exposure while I save myself.
528. [desperate] Well, um, the primates are still in their night enclosures and, er, the reptile house ventilation system will, you know, pull those fumes straight into their habitat within minutes.
529. [crying while speaking] These animals trust me to protect them and I've raised, [passionately], some of them from birth, watching them grow, [trembling], knowing they depend on me completely.
530. [bitter] Um, you know, I've already lost two endangered snow leopards to, well, budget cuts last year and I mean, [defeated], I can't lose anyone else, not like this.
531. [relieved] Well, um, thank you, I mean, I just need to, er, get the baby orangutan and seal the ventilation systems.
532. [grateful] The emergency shut-off valves are in the basement but the, [worried], generator failed last week so we'll be working in darkness with just, [nervously], flashlights to guide us through.
533. Er, the orangutan won't come to strangers so, um, I'll need to coax her out myself while you, [pleading], handle the ventilation systems, and well, [exhausted], pray we're fast enough.
534. [resolute] I know, um, the risks but these animals would, er, die for me too if they could, [emotionally], understand what that meant.
535. [accepting] Um, you're right, I mean, let's go save who we can while, er, we still have the chance.
536. [hopeful] Just promise me we'll try everything possible to, [bravely], save them all, even if it seems impossible.
537. They called me today. The Stanford program, I mean. [pause] I got in. I actually got in. [very quietly] And they specifically mentioned the diversity initiative when they called, which is... I don't know how to feel about that exactly. [hesitantly] Like, obviously I'm qualified, right? My GPA is solid, my research is—[defensive] I worked my ass off for this. But then there's this voice, um, this little voice that keeps asking if I would've gotten in otherwise. [frustrated] Which is so stupid because I know I deserve this, I do. My mentor keeps telling me that these programs exist because, [passionately], talent is everywhere but opportunity isn't. And I get that, intellectually. [sigh] It's just... my cousin got into Yale last year and nobody questioned whether she belonged there. [bitter] But I already know what people are going to think when they hear about me. [long pause] You know what though? [confidently] Maybe that's exactly why I need to be there. Maybe breaking down those doors, well, maybe that's part of my job now. [very excited] God, Stanford! I'm going to Stanford! [laugh] My grandmother is going to cry when I tell her. She didn't even finish high school because—[trailing off] [warmly] She's the reason I even believed I could do this. [determined] So yeah, I'm taking this spot. Every bit of it.
538. [reluctant] I, umm, need you to understand that what I'm about to, [careful], share is highly unusual and, well, it's going to require some, [measured], additional context that might be, you know, difficult to process. [long pause]
539. [steady] Your genetic markers show a direct, [uncomfortable], paternal lineage to someone whose DNA we have on file from, [lower voice], criminal investigations dating back forty years. [exhales slowly]
540. [gentle] The man who raised you may not have been, [delicate], your biological father according to these results. [sighs]
541. [clinical] The DNA match connects you to seventeen, [reluctant], unsolved cases across three states between 1978 and, [quieter], 1985. [heavy silence]
542. [firm] Um, we ran the test three times to be, [methodical], absolutely certain and, well, the probability of error is less than, [precise], one in ten billion so I mean, there's no mistake here. [clears throat]
543. [professional] Look, er, legally I'm required to, [tense], notify law enforcement within seventy-two hours, so, um, you need to decide how you want to handle this.
544. You're not responsible for your biological father's, [sympathetic], actions but this information will become part of, [resigned], public record once the authorities are, [trailing off], notified. [pause]
545. [regretful] Um, sometimes genetic testing reveals, [heavy], truths we never anticipated discovering, and, well, I wish I had better news for you, I mean, I really do.
546. That's entirely possible given the, [careful], timeline of events we're discussing. [long silence]
547. [soft] Well, um, there are support groups for people who discover, [gentle], unexpected parentage through DNA testing, so, er, you don't have to process this alone. [pause]
548. I've been, um, watching you for forty-three years, [steady], Thomas, and well, tonight everything you've built on, [grave], suffering is about to collapse. [sighs deeply]
549. The hundred souls you claim to, [cold], own are gathering in the quarters right now, planning their freedom.
550. [gentle] I appeared to you, um, once before when you were seven, [remembering], drowning in the river, and I, well, [soft], pulled you to shore because your life had, I mean, purpose then.
551. [firm] You promised God that day you'd, well, [intense], be worthy of saving but, um, look what you've become instead. [voice breaking]
552. [sorrowful] Chains are not charity, [disappointed], Thomas, and the blood on your, [heavy], fields cries out to heaven every, [anguished], single dawn.
553. [quiet] Well, I've watched you whip men for, [pained], reading, separate mothers from, um, [breaking], children, and sell human beings like, I mean, [disgusted], cattle at market.
554. [fierce] Don't you dare use heaven's name to, well, [furious], justify your cruelty when you know, um, [trembling], exactly what evil you perpetuate. [weeping]
555. [solemn] Then tonight I withdraw my, [final], protection from you forever.
556. [fading] Um, listen—the, well, bells.
557. [ethereal] Your reckoning has begun and this, [vanishing], time, Thomas, no angel will, [distant], save you from drowning. [disappears]
558. [surprised] Well, uh, we definitely handle custom orders but your voice sounds, [recognition dawning], really familiar like I've heard it before, I mean, somewhere. [pause]
559. [stunned] Oh my god, Sarah, is that really, [emotional], you standing there in your fancy engineer clothes after, [voice breaking], twenty years of complete radio silence?
560. [bitter] Some of us didn't have college scholarships or, [hurt], parents who could afford to send us away to chase, [softer], bigger dreams.
561. You promised we'd stay in touch when you left for that, [sad], engineering program at State.
562. Well, uh, complicated is watching your best friend's life through, [pained], social media posts while you're here breathing in metal dust and wondering if they even, [hollow], remember your name, I mean.
563. You knew about dad and still took you, um, ten years to come back here, [accusatory], to do something about it, I mean?
564. [shocked] Mom never told me you tried to, [confused], come back for the funeral.
565. [considering] The foundry closes at six but I usually stay late to finish, [warming], personal projects these days. [softly]
566. After twenty years of silence, coffee seems like, [gentle], a pretty small bridge to cross.
567. [tender] Yeah well, I mean, I'm good at forging things that last, so maybe between us we can, [hopeful], build something that won't fall apart this time. [sighs]
568. [trembling] So you're saying that, um, my grandmother's stories about, [overwhelmed], being descended from nobility weren't just, well, [voice breaking], fairy tales she told us when we couldn't afford, [whispering], groceries?
569. [stunned] But we lived in, well, a two-bedroom apartment where the heat, [bitter], got shut off every winter, so um, how could we be heirs to anything?
570. The estate in Scotland has been held in, [incredulous], trust for two centuries waiting for someone to, [shaking], present these exact documents that your grandmother, [tearful], somehow kept hidden in that old music box.
571. [crying] She used to trace the, um, family crest on my hand with her finger when, [nostalgic], I couldn't sleep, and I mean, she'd whisper about castles and, [breaking], lands that belonged to our blood even though we had, well, nothing. [sniffles]
572. So we weren't just, um, nobility but actually, [proud], did something good with it?
573. Worth thirty-seven million pounds.
574. [overwhelmed] She died last month still believing that, um, someday I'd find these papers in her, [choked], music box, and I mean, she made me promise to show them to a real historian. [cries softly]
575. You were her, [realizing], history professor at the community college thirty years ago.
576. [shocked] You've known this whole time who, well, I really was and just, [hurt], watched me struggle through law school working three jobs while you, [accusatory], sat on proof that could have changed everything, I mean, everything?
577. [softly] She always said character had to be, [understanding], built from scratch, not handed down with silver spoons. [sighs deeply]
578. [defensive] Look, um, I was going to tell you, I mean, well, I just needed some time to, [desperate], figure out how to explain everything because, [shaking], it's not what you think and, you know, [voice cracking], I can replace them eventually.
579. You've been, [anxious], counting and tracking everything like you suspected me all along when I thought we were, [hurt], building this collection as partners.
580. Um, well, I—
581. The collectors who bought them didn't even, [ashamed], know they were stolen because I told them you were, [mumbling], retiring and liquidating inventory.
582. [desperate] I owed people money who were going to, [terrified], hurt me or worse and you've been supporting me for so, [pleading], long that I couldn't ask for more help.
583. [barely audible] The gambling started as just weekend poker but then I kept, [trembling], chasing losses and before I knew it the interest was compounding faster than I could, [defeated], keep up with payments and they started making, [voice breaking], threats about what would happen if I didn't pay.
584. [crying] You already do everything for me and I'm thirty-eight years old still living in your guest room unable to, [ashamed], hold down a job. [sniffles]
585. [broken] Um, I know, well, I sold it last week to, [choking], pay off the final installment, you know.
586. I kept one small tin hidden in my room because, well, [guilty], I couldn't bear to let it all go, um. [whispers]
587. [volatile] Yes, um, I understand that I'm a parasite who destroyed the only, [self-loathing], good thing in my worthless life and, well, I understand that you'll never, [defeated], forgive me for betraying the one person who never gave up on me, I mean, even when everyone else did.
588. [defensive] That wasn't my fault and the investigation, [firm], cleared me completely of any wrongdoing despite what the news said.
589. The oxygen system failure was a, [frustrated], mechanical issue that had nothing to do with my actions, and if you'd actually read the report instead of, [angry], believing gossip, you'd know that. [exhales sharply]
590. [trembling] Look, um, I was checking the weather alerts, okay, because there was a storm coming and, well, I needed to know if we should, er, adjust the feeding schedule, so I mean, that's actually part of the job.
591. [desperate] Um, the alarms were, uhh, always going off for minor things, and I mean, how was I supposed to know this time was different? [voice cracking]
592. [quiet] Nobody trained me properly there and they threw me into, [broken], a night shift alone after only two days, which wasn't even, [trailing off], legal according to regulations. [long pause]
593. Well, um, yeah, they said I was a quick learner and, er, the regular night guy called in sick so, [defeated], they didn't really have another option.
594. [hopeful] So, um, does that mean you'll actually, [nervous], give me a chance here, because I mean, I really need this job and, well, I promise I'll follow every protocol exactly.
595. [grateful] Thank you for giving me this chance when nobody else would even, [emotional], interview me after what happened. [sniffles]
596. [determined] I understand completely and I'll prove that what happened, [confident], wasn't who I really am as a technician.
597. [eager] Where do we begin because I want to learn, [earnest], everything you can teach me about doing this job right and making sure those fish, [passionate], thrive under our care?
598. You're the one who taught me that, [cold], authenticity is just a matter of who's telling the, [sharp], story and how much they're willing to pay for the, [dismissive], privilege.
599. [measured] Well, um, the thing is, I've already arranged with the auctioneer to, [knowing], extend my credit line far beyond what your, er, current financial situation allows after that, [pointed], unfortunate incident in Monaco, you know.
600. [defensive] My paper trail is cleaner than your, [irritated], conscience has ever been, and unlike you, I don't leave, [steady], witnesses who might remember faces or, [trailing], names—
601. Old times died when you, um, sold me out to the, [harsh], Belgians, I mean, over that diamond scheme.
602. [cutting] Your warning came twelve hours after they'd already, [furious], frozen my accounts.
603. [scoffing] The only thing you've ever set up is the, [venomous], next person foolish enough to trust your, [deliberate], silver tongue and those practiced tears you can summon on, [mocking], command.
604. [softening] Don't do that thing where you make this, [frustrated], personal when we both chose this life knowing exactly what it, [resigned], costs.
605. Those buyers you're talking about are, [warning], already working with me and they've been, um, feeding you false leads for weeks while I've been, [satisfied], setting up the real score that makes this painting look like, well, pocket change.
606. [triumphant] Um, the Vermeer is yours if you want it because, well, I've already got what I, [amused], came for—watching you realize you've been played at your own, er, game.
607. [leaving] Um, enjoy your fake painting and the FBI tail that's been, [final], following you since you walked in here—yeah, I called them too, er, consider us even now. [footsteps fading]
608. [defensive] The Johnsons asked me to, [quiet], stay longer to make sure Princess doesn't get, [nervous], anxious—she has separation issues and needs, [trailing off], constant attention.
609. [caught] I can explain, I mean, it's not what you're, [panicking], thinking—my landlord evicted me last month and, um, the Johnsons said I could stay here if, [desperate], if there was ever an emergency with the pets, so well, this counts as an emergency. [sighs]
610. [pleading] Please don't—I've been taking, [trembling], perfect care of everything here, the plants are thriving, [frantic], the cats are happy, and nothing's been touched except what I need for, [voice cracking], basic survival.
611. [resigned] So, um, you're saying I have to leave, well, today then—after I've been here two months already taking, [hollow], care of their whole life while they're, [bitter], living it up in Europe, and um, now I'm just supposed to go back to, [breaking], to nothing?
612. Well, they know I'm here every day, um, they just don't know it's, [ashamed], every night too—I mean, what difference does it make if their pets are being loved and their house is secure?
613. [desperate] Um, I haven't stolen anything or, well, damaged anything—I sleep on the floor most nights so I don't, [shaking], mess up their perfect furniture, you know?
614. What I see is someone who's never been, [bitter], homeless judging someone who is. [pause]
615. [surprised] Wait, you were, um, homeless too—then you know what it's like when, [hopeful], when you're just trying to survive and, well, an opportunity presents itself that doesn't really hurt anyone but, [conflicted], saves you from the street?
616. [defeated] So what happens now—you call them, um, tell them everything, and I lose my job, er, my only income, and well, the only roof I have over my, [voice cracking], head all in one phone call?
617. [cautious] Um, what kind of solution—I mean, are you saying you won't, [uncertain], tell them if I leave today, or, well, are you offering something else entirely?
618. [professional] I wasn't aware that my presence at a company event required me to, [defensive], socialize with every partner's significant other who happens to attend.
619. [nervous] Well, I mean, I have no idea what you're, [uncomfortable], implying with these rather, um, [strained], bizarre accusations about my professional behavior at what should be, you know, [clearing throat], a pleasant evening. [coughs]
620. [whispered] Um, I don't, well, know.
621. [desperate] Listen, whatever you think you've discovered in those, [panicking], reports is simply a misunderstanding of complex financial instruments that civilians rarely comprehend.
622. My department processes millions in medical billing cycles and any, [frustrated], perceived irregularities are standard variance within acceptable, [technical], industry parameters that undergo regular auditing by, [firm], certified professionals not bored housepets. [exhales sharply]
623. [defeated] Those transactions were authorized under emergency, [weak], protocols during the system migration last quarter. [sighs heavily]
624. She doesn't deserve to lose everything because of, [breaking], my mistakes in judgment. [voice cracking]
625. You hired forensic accountants with her, [shocked], money to investigate her own company while living off her, [disgusted], generosity and sleeping in her, [venomous], bed every night?
626. Well, I mean, what exactly do you, um, [calculating], want from me then?
627. [hollow] So, um, the kept man becomes the, well, [bitter], keeper after all. [laughs bitterly]
628. [defensive] Look, I didn't know you'd be the one, [bitter], assigned to my case either, and trust me, [harsh], if I had another option I'd be, [exhausted], walking right back out that door.
629. [firm] You made your choice when you testified, [cold], against me in court. [pause]
630. [angry] Don't you dare, I mean, bring her into this when you, [shaking], weren't even there for her last, um, three months because you were too, [bitter], busy with your perfect life.
631. Yeah well, um, kind of hard to visit when you're locked in a, [harsh], cell thanks to your own, well, family turning you in.
632. [softer] The electrician apprenticeship I completed inside—it's, [hesitant], real work at least. [sighs]
633. [bitter] Yeah, before I started, [regretful], breaking everything I touched including, [voice breaking], our family and every, [trailing off], relationship that ever mattered to me.
634. [uncertain] I don't, um, even know who I am now—fifteen years changes, [lost], a person in ways you can't, well, imagine from the outside. [exhales deeply]
635. [defensive] Why would you even, um, want to help me after everything I, [guilty], put you through, all those nights you, well, bailed me out before it got too bad?
636. [struggling] I can't promise I won't, [scared], mess this up again. [voice cracks]
637. [trembling] Okay, um, so where do we, [uncertain], start with all this paperwork and, well, whatever else needs to happen for me to, [hesitant], actually have a chance out here?
638. [defensive] Look, um, I've been rigging stunts for, like, [methodical], fifteen years and I know exactly what weight tolerances these, [frustrated], cables can handle, so, er, there's really no reason to, [hesitantly], panic about a simple test run. [sigh]
639. [confidently] Um, these calculations have been, [clearing throat], triple-checked by the stunt coordinator and, er, [firmly], every safety protocol has been followed to the letter, so, like, [empathetically], I understand your concern but we need to proceed. [pause]
640. Well, um, the thing is we've already, [exhausted], delayed shooting twice this week and if we don't, er, [apologetic], test this rig now, we'll lose our lead actor to, like, [trailing off], another production commitment tomorrow morning...
641. [frustrated] Um, shifting the rigging point means, [loudly], recalculating every single angle and, well, [regretful], reinstalling the entire pulley system which would take, er, [monotone], at least eight hours we don't have. [groan]
642. [meekly] The producer already signed off on this, [hesitantly], exact configuration after reviewing all the safety measures.
643. Look, um, what if we, er, [thoughtfully], suspend a protective net underneath, you know?
644. [warm] I've got some high-density theatrical scrim that's, [curious], practically invisible on camera but could catch, [animated], any debris if something somehow went wrong during the test.
645. [professional] Fair enough, and we should probably, [sincerely], document the chandelier's condition before and after, [pause], just to prove nothing happened to it.
646. [collaborative] You know, um, maybe if we work together on this, [friendly], we can actually make it safer than either of our, er, [optimistic], original plans would have been.
647. [laughing] Well, um, nobody wants to be the person who, [joking], destroyed a priceless antique on camera, especially when the, er, [cheerfully], behind-the-scenes footage would definitely end up online. [chuckle]
648. [slowly] Well, uh, I specialize in medical lithographs actually, and, [pause], something about your voice sounds familiar, like, from another time entirely, umm, another life almost. [gasp softly]
649. [shocked] Dr. Morrison, I never thought I'd, [trailing off], see you again outside of those sterile hospital walls.
650. I, well, took up lithography during recovery because, [bitter], drawing hearts felt like understanding the stranger's gift beating in my chest, like, [regretful], honoring what I'd been given while, [past-dwelling], processing what I'd almost lost. [sigh]
651. [whispering loudly] You saved me.
652. [bored] That's what you tell yourself.
653. [curious] So, umm, you want me to create art from the organ that nearly killed me, I mean, the one you replaced with someone else's tragedy, [confused], turning medical precision into something, [sadly], beautiful enough to honor your mentor's career, you know?
654. [very sincerely] I'll create something that shows not just the anatomy but the, [thoughtfully], impossible hope that surgeons like you carry into operating rooms at, [desperately], three in the morning when families are praying in waiting rooms, [crying while speaking], believing in miracles.
655. [monotone] Well, um, seven years later I'm still here, making art from medical diagrams, like, [deeply], trying to understand why I lived when so many don't, er, wondering what I'm supposed to do with this borrowed time. [groan]
656. [tearfully] Um, I'll do it. [sniffle]
657. [determined] Let's, um, create something that shows the heart not just as a pump but as, [philosophically], a keeper of time, a marker of moments that could have ended but didn't, like, [finished], a testament to second chances that reminds your mentor why, [powerfully], the work matters even after forty years of holding hearts in his hands. [cry]
658. [fragile] Um, I, er, live here.
659. [rehearsed] Well, um, welcome to the Whitmore Estate, built in 1887, where, [monotone], we begin our midnight tour through the grand ballroom, and er, [trailing off]...
660. [warm] I mean, um, if you're looking for valuables, well, [bitter], everything worth stealing was auctioned off months ago, you know. [sigh]
661. [defensive] Well, er, I used to work here legitimately before they, [upset], closed it down, you know, so I mean, I have more right to be here than you do.
662. [anxious] Um, look, I won't call the cops on you if, [pleading], you don't report me because, I mean, [very quietly], this place is all I have left and, well, I can't go back to the shelter.
663. The third-floor study has a, [whispering loudly], wall safe behind the portrait that the auctioneers, [excited], missed completely, and there's still, [confidently], some old jewelry in there from the original family.
664. [melancholic] Well, um, maybe if you find something valuable enough, you could, [hopeful], leave me a little cut so I can, er, [sad], pay for a real place for once, you know? [long pause]
665. [confused] But I just told you where, um, [frustrated], everything is hidden and you're walking away from, I mean, [loudly], the whole reason you broke in here?
666. [stunned] You mean like a, [gradually warming], real business where people would actually listen to my tours? [gasp softly]
667. [tearful] After six months of talking to empty rooms, um, practicing these speeches to keep myself, [shaky voice], sane and now someone actually thinks, er, [crying while speaking], my tours could be worth something, I mean, [very sincerely], this is the first real hope I've had in so long.
668. [stern] Look, um, this VR therapy program needs to be, [empathetically], accurate if it's going to help survivors, so I need you to, well, walk me through every detail no matter how, you know, uncomfortable it makes you.
669. [bitter] Um, yeah, I know.
670. [frustrated] My sister was one of them, which is why I'm, [slowly], the only animator who agreed to take on this project. [sigh]
671. [furious] Stop apologizing. [gasp]
672. [confused] Why are you doing this now, after five years in prison, [very sad], suddenly wanting to help when you've already, [whispering], destroyed so many lives? [laugh]
673. [angry] Um, er, that's convenient.
674. [curious] The warehouse had a specific smell that my sister mentioned in her testimony, [clearing throat], something about motor oil and sea salt that triggered her panic attacks for years. [sneeze]
675. [jealous] You know, um, she's getting married next month to someone who helped her heal, and, well, [loudly], she's finally starting to have good days again.
676. [friendly] Well, um, the virtual environment is almost complete, and, you know, [quickly], once we test it with the therapy protocols, [confident], we might actually help people reclaim their lives from monsters like you.
677. [playful] Ironically, your detailed confessions are going to help me create something that, [upset], undoes your damage, turning your darkness into a tool for, [hopefully], healing and recovery. [deep breath]
678. [avoiding] Well, um, I don't know what you're, [hesitantly], talking about because, you know, I haven't thought about Dad's firm in years.
679. The markets don't, [coldly], destroy people, they just reveal what was already, [monotone], broken in the system.
680. [defensive] My donations are purely, [quickly], tax-motivated investments in community infrastructure that happen to, [trailing off], align with certain strategic objectives...
681. [trembling] Stop doing that thing where you, [frustrated], cross-examine family members like they're on the witness stand.
682. [urgent] The clinic was about to, [anxious], close when I started the donations and you were working yourself to, [exhausted], death trying to save it alone.
683. Every algorithm I write takes money from hedge funds and, [disciplined], redistributes it through channels they'd never, [cynically], approve of if they knew where it was, [pause], going.
684. [contemplative] The high-frequency trading world thinks I'm, [mocking], ruthless but they don't know I'm using their own tools to, [vindicated], undo what they build.
685. [vulnerable] Well, um, I've been watching you in court sometimes, [crying while speaking], from the back row where you couldn't see me, anyway.
686. So, um, maybe we could grab coffee and, [nervous], discuss how to expand the clinic without making it look like, [whispering loudly], market manipulation, you know?
687. Well, I mean, we can't change the past but, [earnest], maybe we can manipulate the future, um, [chuckle], legally speaking of course. [long pause]
688. [defensive] I didn't know you worked here, and honestly if I'd, [bitter], known I probably would have chosen a different, [hesitantly], VA facility for this appointment.
689. [anxious] The forms asked about emergency contacts and I almost, [mumbling], wrote your name out of habit before remembering we haven't, [slowly], talked since everything fell apart.
690. You became a healthcare navigator while I disappeared into, [monotone], coding and data systems where emotions don't exist.
691. [frustrated] Well, um, the algorithms I write don't, [sarcastic], judge me for needing therapy and they don't, [coldly], remind me of promises I broke years ago, you know? [sigh]
692. [tearfully] Um, I've been having these panic attacks at work, you know, and, [shaky voice], nobody there knows what to do with me. [cough]
693. [whispered] Thank you.
694. [exhausted] Well, um, the money's good but the isolation is, er, [hollow], killing me slowly and I wake up every morning wondering if this is, [regretful], all there is. [groan]
695. [vulnerable] The truth is I've been writing code that analyzes, [breaking], mental health patterns while ignoring my own completely.
696. [resigned] Um, I guess, well, seeing you here makes this feel less like, [trembling], failing and more like maybe, [hopefully], finding my way back to something. [sniffle]
697. [grateful] I mean, um, after everything that happened between us, well, you offering to help me through this is more than I, [emotional], deserve but exactly what I, [whispering loudly], need right now. [cry]
698. [warm] Wait a minute, I know that voice—Tommy, is that, [surprised], really you after all these years on the road?
699. Well, um, I mean, life's funny.
700. [measured] The music was everything until Sarah got sick and suddenly, [empathetically], I realized there were more important stages in life than the ones with, [gently], spotlights and crowds. [sigh]
701. [confident] Exactly right.
702. [thoughtful] That's kind of you to say, but my daughter needs, [proudly], stability more than I need to chase old dreams. [chuckle]
703. [friendly] The road you're on isn't wrong, it's just, [contemplative], different from mine now.
704. [peacefully] Maybe we both were, in our own, [wise], ways.
705. [reflective] You know, um, sometimes I still hear our songs on the radio while I'm, [wistful], plowing these empty roads at dawn, and, er, it reminds me that we did create something, [proud], beautiful together even if our paths diverged. [deep breath]
706. [accepting] I've got twelve more miles of highway to clear before sunrise, but maybe, [optimistic], when spring comes and the roads are clear, we could play again.
707. [content] Some nights, er, when the snow falls just right and the world goes quiet, I mean, I still play in my garage, and, [fulfilled], it feels like coming home to an old friend who never, [understanding], judges where you've been.
708. [warm] Well, um, I've been editing dialogue for films about, like, families reuniting and, [bitter], here I am living the cliché of, you know, [whispering], coming home for a funeral.
709. [regretful] The sound of water moving through those, [shaky voice], canal chambers still appears in my dreams sometimes, [crying while speaking], like a heartbeat I can't escape. [sigh]
710. [apologetic] In my work I splice together, [confused], conversations between actors pretending to care about each other while, [anxious], my own sister became a stranger.
711. [relieved] Sometimes when I'm working late, [whispering loudly], removing breath sounds from recordings, I remember us as kids shouting across the locks.
712. [tearful] I edit out the, um, awkward pauses in movie dialogues but, well, [trembling], can't fix the decade-long pause between us, you know, [clearing throat], no matter how skilled I've become. [long pause]
713. Maybe we can start again.
714. [surprised] After all this time you never, [emotionally], changed anything in there, not even the, [overwhelmed], film posters I left on the walls?
715. [grateful] In my job, um, I spend hours making dialogue sound, well, natural and meaningful but, [sincerely], nothing I've edited comes close to, er, [softly speaking], what you just said.
716. [peaceful] The real conversations we need to have can't be, umm, [accepting], edited or perfected, they just have to, well, [gently], happen as messy and raw as they come, like, [very quietly], this one right now. [deep breath]
717. [moved] Um, yeah, he would.
718. Twenty years since graduation and you still, [frustrated], can't help yourself from judging everyone who doesn't, [coldly], meet your standards even after your spectacular, [very quietly], fall from grace.
719. [stern] Um, well, right.
720. Those dreams you keep mentioning were always, [empathetically], yours alone while the rest of us just got swept along in your wake.
721. [comprehending] The divorce settlement was brutal, I heard about the, [slowly], custody battle and how she got the houses, [whispering], the investments, even your father's, [very melancholic], watch collection.
722. [warm] Happiness isn't, er, a secret, it's just accepting that, [calmly], sometimes life takes you places you never expected, umm. [chuckle]
723. You're still trying to live in that, [formal], penthouse apartment in your mind while missing the, [relieved], fact that ground level has its own view. [deep pitch]
724. [friendly] Your kids will come around when they're older and, [sincerely], understand what really happened between you and Sarah.
725. [confident] Listen, I mean, I get free golf every morning before, [cheerfully], the members arrive, I watch the sunrise over, [peacefully], the fairway, and nobody's coming after me for, um, insider trading or alimony. [yawn]
726. [playful] Remember when we used to sneak onto this very course at, [nostalgically], midnight during sophomore year, drinking cheap beer and, [animated], pretending we belonged here with the old money crowd?
727. [gently] The first tee time is mine tomorrow at dawn if you want to, well, [hopeful], join me for nine holes, um, no charge.
728. [defensive] Look, um, I mean, I took this salvage job before I knew, [quietly], whose boat we were pulling up from the bottom, you know.
729. [calculated] He called me the night before he left port asking if I'd, [anxious], reconsider taking over the business but I told him, [coldly], the same thing I've been saying for fifteen years. [pause]
730. Well, um, the thing is, I mean, he kept calling about, [empathetically], wanting to make things right between us before it was, [regretful], too late but I just couldn't, er, [trailing off], bring myself to answer those last few calls, you know.
731. The insurance investigator found something strange in the wheelhouse that, [nervous], suggests this wasn't just mechanical failure like everyone assumed it was, [carefully], based on the preliminary reports. [clearing throat]
732. [whispering loudly] Um, well, I mean, listen. [long pause]
733. There were debts he never told you about that reached, [worried], nearly half a million dollars to people who don't exactly, [slowly], file paperwork through proper channels. [groan]
734. [apologetic] The crane's pulling her up in twenty minutes and when we open that wheelhouse, [hesitant], we're going to find evidence that changes everything about how, [monotone], we remember him and what really happened that night. [gasp softly]
735. Well, um, the thing is, I mean, I've been operating cranes for fifteen years but my hands won't stop, [trembling], shaking thinking about lifting his boat and seeing what's, [very melancholic], left of the life he tried so hard to preserve for us, er, [whispering], even when we both abandoned him. [cry]
736. [warm] After fifteen years of running from this family and these waters, [passionately], maybe it's time we both faced what we left behind and what, [sincerely], Dad was trying to protect us from.
737. [resolved] Start securing the deck lines because when this boat surfaces there's, [determined], no going back from what we're about to discover. [deep breath]
738. [bitter] Thirty years. I mean, thirty goddamn years I've been standing on that floor, and they just— [pause] they send us an email. Not even a, you know, a proper meeting or anything. Just this, um, corporate bullshit about "restructuring" and [mocking] "market conditions." [sigh] 

Six months. That's all I had left, honestly. Six more months and I'd have my full pension, my— [trailing off] I don't even know what I'm gonna... [frustrated] The smell of fish, it's like, it's in my clothes, my hair, under my fingernails. [chuckle] My wife always said I'd never lose that smell. Guess she was wrong about that, huh?

[very sad] Tommy from packaging, he's er, he's only been there five years but his kid just started college. And Maria— [shaky voice] Maria's worked the line since before I started. What's she supposed to do at sixty-two? [angry] Start over? Where? 

[exhausted] I keep thinking about my first day, right? Young and stupid, thought I'd just, ah, work there a couple years. [regretful] Save up some money, move on to something better. [long pause] 

[very quietly] Funny how a couple years turns into your whole damn life.
739. They gave me everything. [regretful] When no one else would even look at my resume, they—they took a chance on me. [short pause] Fresh out of community college, no experience, just some certifications and, um, desperation. [bitter] And now I'm the one who's gonna bring them down. 

[anxious] I found it by accident, actually. Was just running routine security audits when I noticed these, [slowly], these weird data packets being routed through offshore servers. [frustrated] At first I thought it was just poor network hygiene, you know? But then I dug deeper and—[gasp softly]—twenty million dollars. [very quietly] Twenty million in embezzled funds, hidden in ghost transactions.

[shaky voice] Mike hired me. He, I mean, he believed in me when I was nobody. [upset] Took me to lunch my first day, introduced me to his kids at the company picnic. [long pause] And his signature is all over these files.

[crying while speaking] I already sent everything to the FBI. [sniffle] Encrypted, untraceable, but they'll know it came from inside. [exhausted] I keep thinking about that first day, how he shook my hand and said, "Welcome to your future, kid." [very sad] Some future this turned out to be, right? [trailing off] I guess doing the right thing isn't supposed to feel like... like betrayal.
740. [hesitantly] Hey, um, I know this is probably weird but I just—I wanted to actually thank you. [short pause] So, we ended up going with Solar Direct instead, and honestly, [apologetic] I feel kind of bad about that? But here's the thing—you were like, the only person who didn't try to, you know, pressure us into signing right then and there. [warm] You actually told us about that warranty issue that nobody else mentioned? 

[chuckle] I mean, every other sales rep was basically like "sign today or lose this amazing deal forever," right? [relieved] But you just, hmm, you laid everything out—the good, the bad, all of it. And when you said we should, er, get multiple quotes? [very sincerely] That meant a lot. Really.

[pause] Look, Solar Direct gave us a better rate, but honestly? [empathetically] I almost went with you anyway just because you were so, I don't know, genuine about everything. My husband kept saying, [animated] "That person actually cared if this was right for us!" 

[sigh] Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is—[grateful] thank you for being honest. You probably lost the sale because of it, but, well, [warm] you gained our respect. And I'm definitely referring people to you. [friendly] That counts for something, right?
741. [bitter] Twenty-three years. Twenty-three years without a single mistake, and then one decimal point—one stupid decimal point in the wrong place, and [frustrated] boom, everything's gone. [short pause] The certification board didn't even, um, let me explain properly. [angry] They just sat there with their clipboards, looking at me like I'm some kind of criminal! 

[regretful] Mrs. Henderson's bill went from eighty dollars to eight thousand. I mean, [nervous laugh] how did I not catch that? [very sad] She's eighty-seven years old, lives on social security, and she—she had a heart episode when she opened that bill. [sniffle] 

[defensive] But it's not like the system flagged it either, you know? [speeding up] There's supposed to be safeguards, checks and balances, someone should have caught it before it went out, but no no no, [loudly] it's all on me! [pause] 

[exhausted] My supervisor, he wouldn't even look at me when he, uh, took my badge. [whispering] "Company policy," he said. [bitter laugh] Company policy. [very melancholic] I trained half the techs in that building. 

[shaky voice] My wife doesn't know yet. I've been sitting in this parking lot for, hmm, two hours? [trailing off] How do you tell someone that the thing you were good at, the thing that paid the mortgage... [sigh] 

[defeated] One decimal point.
742. [shaky voice] I can't—I literally can't process this right now. So, um, you remember Jake's whole thing about the water treatment plant? The one where I basically laughed in his face for like, six months straight? [nervous laugh] Well, uh, I just got the lab results back from that independent testing I did to prove him wrong, and... [long pause] 

Jesus Christ, he was right. Like, actually, legitimately right. The chromium levels are—they're off the charts. [anxiously] I mean, we've been drinking this, you know? Our kids have been drinking this. And I just kept telling him he was being paranoid, that he needed to, er, get off the internet conspiracy forums and—[frustrated] God, I'm such an asshole.

[quickly] The thing is, I pride myself on being the rational one, right? The evidence-based thinker. But I didn't even look at his data because, well, it was Jake. Conspiracy theory Jake who thinks, um, everything is a cover-up. [regretful] Except this time it actually was. 

[very quietly] How many other things has he been right about that I just... dismissed? [sigh] I need to call him. Apologize. And then, honestly, we need to figure out what the hell we do with this information because [speeding up] if this is real, if these numbers are accurate, then basically everyone in town is being slowly poisoned and nobody knows.
743. [relieved] Twenty-three years I've been standing in that courtroom, and today—God, today was different. You see so much cynicism, you know? So many cases where you're just... [frustrated] wondering if anything matters. But this afternoon, when Judge Martinez read that verdict, [pause] everything clicked. 

The defendant—this kid who'd been wrongfully accused—his mother just [cry] broke down completely. Not from grief though. From relief. [warm] And the actual perpetrator, he'd finally confessed after the new evidence came in. I mean, the system actually worked. [chuckle] Can you believe that?

I watched the prosecutor shake the kid's hand, [very sincerely] genuinely apologetic for what he'd been through. No ego, no defensiveness. Just... humanity. The public defender—she'd fought for two years on this case, basically pro bono at this point—she just stood there [emotional pause] kind of stunned, like she couldn't believe it either.

[thoughtful] You stand there in uniform, um, maintaining order, and most days you're just... existing in this machine. But today? [passionate] Today I watched justice actually happen. Real justice. Not perfect, not fast enough, but real. [quietly] That kid gets his life back. His mother gets her son back. And maybe—just maybe—I get to believe in this whole thing again.
744. [slowly] Okay, so... this valve, it's like—hmm, I mean, ninety years of oxidation here. [concentrated] The thing is, um, you can actually feel the history in these dents, you know? [short pause] Someone played Taps on this. [very quietly] Probably played it at, er, Normandy or—I don't know, maybe the Pacific. 

[animated] And honestly, when the grandson called me, right? He goes, [emotional] "It was my grandfather's, and we need it for Tuesday," and I'm thinking—[chuckle] well, that's in three days, but then he tells me what it's for. [pause] A memorial service. [very slowly] For the last surviving member of their unit.

[warm] So anyway, I've been working on this, like, sixteen hours straight now, and the valves are finally—[excited] oh God, listen to this! [relieved] That's it, that's actually—it's singing again. [sniffle] I mean, basically, instruments don't forget, you know? They just, um, they need someone to... [trailing off] to remember with them.

[shaky voice] Tomorrow, er, when they play Taps at that service, it won't just be any trumpet. [passionately] It'll be THIS trumpet, the one that was there, that survived when—[cry] when so many didn't. [very sincerely] And honestly, fixing this? It's probably the most important work I've ever done.
745. [gasp softly] Oh my God, Jamie just—she actually did it. [shaky voice] I mean, for three months we've been working on, you know, just basic paragraph structure and she... [pause] She wrote a whole essay today. Like, a real essay with, um, transitions and everything. [crying while speaking] I watched her face when she realized she'd finished it—the whole thing—and honestly, I just... [sniffle] 

The thing is, her parents told me she'd never be able to, er, organize her thoughts like that. [angry] Her last school basically gave up on her, said she was, I don't know, "too scattered" or whatever. [bitter] But today, oh man, today she just kept going, and I could see her, like, fighting through every sentence but she wouldn't stop. [very excited] And then—get this—she asked if she could read it out loud! [laugh] Jamie, who usually won't even, hmm, speak up in class!

[warm] You know what she told me after? She said, "I thought my brain was broken." [cry] God, that just... [long pause] These kids, they carry so much, thinking they're somehow less than. [extremely happy] But she proved them all wrong today. Actually, she proved herself wrong, and that's, well, that's everything. [relieved] That's absolutely everything.
746. [relieved] Seven years. Seven years of looking over my shoulder and they just—they pardoned me. Just like that. [pause] I walked through downtown today, um, nobody even recognized me. The coffee shop I used to go to every morning? [whispering] It's a bank now. [bitter] A bank. Sarah got married—I saw it on Facebook. She has two kids. [slowly] Two kids I'll never know. My brother, he... [sigh] he stopped waiting for me to come back after year three, I guess. 

[confused] The apartment building where I lived, they tore it down. Built some luxury condos or whatever. [quietly] Even the trees look different. Older. Like, obviously they're older but—[long pause] Everyone just kept living. [sad] My nephew doesn't remember me. He was four when I left, now he's eleven and he looked at me like I was a stranger. Which, honestly, I am. [trailing off] I am a stranger...

[very melancholic] They gave me my freedom back but there's nothing left to return to. The world I knew, the life I had—[laugh] it's like trying to step back into a photograph that's already faded. [regretful] Maybe that's the real punishment. Not the running, but the coming back to find out you've already been erased.
747. [bitter] I was right. Every single instinct I had about this case, every red flag I saw coming—I called it. [laugh] You know what the judge said? She actually said, "Counsel, your assessment was remarkably prescient." Prescient. [sarcastic] Great word for "you saw this train wreck coming but couldn't stop it."

I mean, I told Marcus from day one—I said, [stern] "They're going to use that contract clause against us." And they did. [long pause] Exactly like I predicted. Down to the specific subsection they'd cite. [frustrated] But being right doesn't matter when the law's not on your side, does it? 

[sigh] Marcus lost his business today. Twenty-three years he built that company, and now... [trailing off] I keep thinking maybe if I'd pushed harder for settlement, or if I'd—no. [shaky voice] That's not fair to myself. I did everything. Filed every motion, explored every angle, basically lived in that law library for three months. 

[whispering] He thanked me, you know? After losing everything, he actually thanked me for fighting. [cry] God, that almost made it worse. Because what's the point of being a brilliant lawyer if you can't actually save your clients? [very quietly] What's the point of being right?
748. [shaky voice] They're bringing him in tomorrow. The one who—who did it to Sarah and Mom. And I'm supposed to, what, show mercy? [bitter] That's literally my job now, right? To be the bigger person, to... [pause] I keep seeing Mom's face that night, you know? In the hospital. [very sad] She couldn't even speak, she just—anyway, um, the council says I have to follow protocol. 

[angry] God, I want to just—no. [deep breath] No, that's not... [slowly] Here's the thing, if I do what I want to do, then honestly, what makes me different from him? [confused] But how do I look at him and not see what he took from us? Sarah still wakes up screaming, and I'm supposed to, er, grant him clemency because he's... [sarcastic] reformed. 

[long pause] 

[quietly] The thing is, Mom would've forgiven him. She always said holding onto hate was like—what was it—drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. [regretful] I guess that's why they chose me for this position, because supposedly I can separate my feelings from... [trailing off] 

[exhausted] Tomorrow I have to look him in the eye and basically decide if mercy is stronger than justice. Or maybe they're the same thing. I don't know anymore.
749. [hesitantly] I've been meaning to tell you this for, um, weeks now but I just— [pause] I don't know how to even say it properly. [warmly] You probably don't realize this, but the way you just... listened to me during those awful months, [voice shaky] when everything with Mark was falling apart? [deep breath] God, I was such a mess. [laughing sadly] Remember when I'd come into your office and just, like, word-vomit about custody schedules? [grateful] You never once told me I was being annoying. [pause] Not once. [getting emotional] And that Tuesday when I completely broke down about the house— [voice cracking] you just handed me tissues and said "take your time." [sniffling] Nobody else did that for me, you know? [steadying] My own sister kept saying I needed to "move on already" but you, [very sincerely] you understood that grief isn't linear. [chuckle] I mean, you probably wanted to tell me to shut up sometimes. [pause] But honestly, having someone who didn't judge me for being angry one day and devastated the next? [warmly] That saved me. [emotional] It really, truly saved me. [clearing throat] So, um, thank you. [smiling speaking] Thank you for being exactly what I needed when I couldn't even ask for it.
750. Everyone kept calling me that, you know—"unlikely hero"—and I mean, it always felt like... [bitter] like they were basically saying I was a coward who got lucky. But today, um, I actually—God, I can't believe I did that. [gasp softly] I ran straight into that burning building. Me. The person who, honestly, gets anxious ordering pizza on the phone.

[shaky voice] My legs are still trembling, actually. But when I saw that kid at the window, it's like—I don't know, something just... clicked? And suddenly I wasn't thinking about, er, all the reasons I couldn't do it. [speeding up] I just moved, like my body knew what to do before my brain could talk me out of it, and then I was inside and the smoke was everywhere and— [pause]

The thing is, I've spent so long thinking everyone was wrong about me. [very quietly] That I wasn't brave, wasn't special, wasn't... anything really. But holding that kid, feeling them grip my shirt while I carried them out— [warm] maybe they weren't wrong. Maybe they saw something I couldn't.

[confidently] I'm not saying I'm suddenly fearless or whatever. Tomorrow I'll probably go back to being scared of basically everything. But for those three minutes? [smiling speaking] Yeah. Unlikely hero sounds about right.
751. [gasp softly] Did that just—did Marcus just actually shake my hand? I mean, [stuttering] h-he literally just looked me in the eye and said I deserved it. Marcus. The same guy who, um, spent the last three years trying to destroy me at every turn. [short pause] God, his hand was so cold. Or maybe mine was? I don't know, I'm still kind of [confused] processing this whole thing.

You know what's weird? [slowly] I thought I'd feel more... triumphant? Like, this is what I wanted, right? Him admitting I was better. [bitter] After all that sabotage, all those times he tried to undercut me, and now he's just—what, gracious in defeat? [laugh] That's rich. 

But honestly, [very quietly] the way his voice cracked a little when he said it... [pause] I mean, he looked genuinely broken. And here's the thing—I actually felt bad for him for like half a second. [frustrated] Which is insane! This is Marcus we're talking about! 

[sigh] Maybe that's what real victory feels like though, you know? Not the crushing your enemies part, but like... [hesitantly] seeing them as human afterward. God, when did I become so [trailing off] philosophical about this...
