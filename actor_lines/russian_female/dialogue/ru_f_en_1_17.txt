Character 1 [en]: So, um, I guess you're [bitter] the new tenant, er, moving into 4B?

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, yeah, that's me! Sorry about all the noise earlier—the movers dropped my couch going up the stairs and it made this horrible scraping sound that probably woke up the entire building. I'm Sarah, by the way.

Character 1 [en]: Right, well, I'm directly below you in 3B, you know, and I work nights, so I mean, I was actually trying to sleep.

Character 2 [en]: Oh no, I'm so sorry! I had no idea anyone would be sleeping at two in the afternoon—wait, that sounds judgmental, I don't mean it like that. Night shift must be brutal. What do you do?

Character 1 [en]: I'm a nurse at the ER downtown.

Character 2 [en]: An ER nurse? Jesus, that's— that's intense. My sister's a nurse too, actually, but she does pediatrics which is its own kind of chaos. Look, I'm really really sorry about the noise, um, is there anything I can, like, do to make it up to you?

Character 1 [en]: Just try to keep it down after noon on weekdays.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely, yes, I can totally do that. I work from home anyway so I'll be super quiet—I'm a graphic designer so it's mostly just me and my computer having staring contests all day. No loud music or anything, I promise.

Character 1 [en]: You work from [bitter] home? Great. More noise all day.

Character 2 [en]: No no no, I swear I'm the quietest person ever when I work! Like, my ex used to joke that I turned into a statue—wouldn't move for hours, just totally absorbed. The only sound you'll hear is probably me talking to my cat when I take breaks.

Character 1 [en]: You have a cat?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, his name's Meatball! He's this [laugh histerically] enormous orange tabby who thinks he's a dog. He actually plays fetch, I'm not even kidding—throws his toy mouse at my feet and waits for me to toss it back.

Character 1 [en]: Meatball? That's, uh, actually kind of cute, I guess, you know what I mean?

Character 2 [en]: Right? He earned the name though—he's twenty-two pounds of pure fluff and attitude. But don't worry, he's not a runner or a jumper, mostly just lounges around judging everyone. You like cats?

Character 1 [en]: I used to have one. Charlie. He passed last year.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is just— it's devastating. Charlie sounds like he was special to you. If you ever want to hang out with Meatball, you're totally welcome to come up. He loves attention from literally anyone.

Character 1 [en]: That's, well, really nice of you to offer, actually, I mean, most neighbors aren't like that anymore.

Character 2 [en]: Are you kidding? We're neighbors now! Plus you're saving lives at the ER while I'm just making logos for craft breweries—least I can do is share my therapeutic chunky boy. Fair warning though, he drools when he's happy.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I'll, um, take you up on that [exhausted] sometime, you know, when things are, er, less hectic at work.

Character 2 [en]: Whenever you want! And hey, seriously, if you ever need someone to, like, grab groceries or whatever when you're doing those [laugh histerically] brutal shifts, just knock. I mean, we night-shift-adjacent people, sort of, gotta stick together, right?
