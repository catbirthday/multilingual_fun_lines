Customer [en]: So I've been—no wait, let me just... I've been pressing buttons for twenty minutes and of course nothing...

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow, um, I actually—I actually used to drive for the district before this job, so I totally, uh, I totally get how frustrating the payment system is. Let me just, um, pull up your account here, what's your employee ID?

Customer [en]: Um, it's, uh... eight four—no sorry, that's my route... hang on...

Customer Support [en]: No worries at all, take your time. I remember I'd always mix those up too, you know?

Customer [en]: Five two seven... three nine. Or wait, is that—yeah. Five two seven three nine.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, okay okay, so that's ID 52739 and I can see, um, I can see your file right here. You're with, uh, Jefferson County district, route 84?

Customer [en]: That's the one. Of course the payment's missing, because why would they just...

Customer Support [en]: So, um, I'm looking at your payment schedule here and, uh, yeah there's definitely—there's definitely something off. Your last payment, um, it shows as processed with reference number PAY-88429-QJ on the 15th but, hmm, never actually deposited.

Customer [en]: Um, exactly, and then I call and the menu's like, uh, "press one for this, press two for"—I don't even know what department handles...

Customer Support [en]: Oh god, I know, I know, that phone tree is, um, it's honestly terrible. We've all complained about it. So what I'm gonna do is, uh, I'm gonna escalate this directly to payroll with priority code PRI-7264-ML, okay?

Customer [en]: I mean, okay but like—wait, you actually drove? Like, um, school bus? Because nobody here ever understands what we...

Customer Support [en]: Yeah! Um, three years actually, before my back gave out. Elementary routes mostly, so like, you know, the really chaotic ones where they're all, uh, they're all screaming and throwing things.

Customer [en]: Oh god, yes, and then, um, then they wonder why we're stressed when the pay doesn't... I've got bills, you know? And my landlord's already...

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, and, um, I remember that panic when my direct deposit failed once right before rent was due. So here's what I'm—I'm putting through an emergency payment request, reference EMP-90331-TK, which should, um, it should hit your account within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: Twenty-four hours? That's—I mean that's actually... nobody's ever done that fast before...

Customer Support [en]: Well, I mean, I sort of know which buttons to push, you know? The system shows, um, it shows you've never had a late payment yourself in, hmm, eight years of service, so this is clearly, uh, clearly their mistake.

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, eight years of perfect... and then this month, of course, because nothing ever just works right...

Customer Support [en]: I'm also, um, I'm also adding a note here with case number CSE-44892-BN that any—any late fees from this should be waived. And honestly? Between you and me, payroll has been, uh, they've been messing up a lot lately.

Customer [en]: Really? So it's not just—I thought maybe I'd done something wrong with the... I don't know, the forms or whatever...

Customer Support [en]: No no no, definitely not you. I've processed, um, probably fifteen similar cases just this week. Your confirmation number for everything is CNF-77205-XP, and um, you can actually call me directly at extension 4429 if the payment doesn't show up tomorrow, okay? Skip that whole awful menu.
