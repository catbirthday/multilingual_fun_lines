=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So um, I just bought something yesterday and, uh, basically I saw it's cheaper now? Like, er, can you help with that?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, I think I can definitely—wait, let me just—actually yes, I'm probably going to be able to protect you from losing out on savings here. What's the, um, what's the... the item you purchased?

Customer [en]: Um, it's a coffee maker. The, uh, let me see here... the Brewmaster Pro?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, okay so I'm pulling up your account now and I want to make sure we get this completely sorted for you so you don't have any worries going forward, alright?

Customer [en]: So basically like, I paid, um, ninety-nine dollars? And now it's, er, seventy-nine?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, so um, I'm seeing your order here, it's ORD-4428-QM91, and uh, let me just—actually, you know what? I think we can, er, definitely fix this for you.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... hmm, you can do the price match then?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, and I'm going to make sure this gets processed correctly the first time so you don't have to call back or worry about anything, your refund reference will be REF-8837-PK22.

Customer [en]: Um, wait, so like, how does this, uh, actually work though?

Customer Support [en]: So basically, um, what I'm doing is—let me find the right—it's kind of like a retroactive adjustment? And um, I'm going to put a note on your account, uh, number ACC-9102-ZM, so if this ever happens again, we'll know to just, you know, automatically help you out.

Customer [en]: Oh that's, er, that's actually really nice. Um, so when do I get the money back?

Customer Support [en]: I think it's usually—no wait, let me check—actually for this type of adjustment it's probably going to be three to five business days back to your original payment method.

Customer [en]: Three to five days? Um, but what if it doesn't, like, what if something goes wrong?

Customer Support [en]: Oh no no, I'm not going to let that happen, um, I'm actually putting in a priority flag on this, uh, transaction TXN-5549-BK88, and um, I'll personally monitor it to make sure it processes.

Customer [en]: So basically you're saying, um, it's guaranteed then? Like, er, for sure?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, and here's what I'm going to do—I'm setting up an automatic email confirmation that'll go out, um, probably within the hour with tracking number TRK-2215-QQ91, so you'll have everything documented.

Customer [en]: Um, okay so, uh, let me see if I understand... twenty dollars back in three to five days?

Customer Support [en]: That's exactly right, and um, you know what? I'm also going to—what's the word—like future-proof this? I'm adding you to our price protection list under code PRT-7763-MM so this kind of thing gets caught automatically.

Customer [en]: Hmm, that's, um, that's actually really helpful. So like, I don't need to do anything else?

Customer Support [en]: Nothing at all, I've got you completely covered here, confirmation number for everything is CNF-8820-LP44, and I really want to make sure you feel secure about this whole thing, okay?
