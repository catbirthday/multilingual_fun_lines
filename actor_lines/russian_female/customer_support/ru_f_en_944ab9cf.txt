=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, I need to—sorry, I mean we have to—no wait, I guess it's just me now, I think I need to split the account?

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, I hear you, and uh, first let me just say I'm—I'm really sorry you're going through this, that's um, that's got to be so hard, let me pull up your account here, what's your account number?

Customer [en]: It's probably under his name, or maybe mine, I don't really know anymore.

Customer Support [en]: Hey no worries at all, um, we'll figure this out together okay? So uh, let me search by phone number, that usually works best, and um, I can see here—yeah got it, account ACC-92847-M, joint account, and uh, listen I've helped with these before, we're gonna make this as easy as possible.

Customer [en]: So like, um, I keep the same number right? Or wait, do I get a different—sorry I'm kind of confused about how this, um, how it all works?

Customer Support [en]: You absolutely keep your number, um, that's yours forever if you want it, so uh, what we'll do is create a new individual account just for you, transfer your line over, and um, basically your ex—er, the other party—they'll stay on the original account REF-2024-83921.

Customer [en]: Tuesday—no wait, Thursday, that's when the lawyers said we need everything separated by.

Customer Support [en]: Thursday, got it, um, and honestly? We're gonna have this done today, like uh, right now actually, so you'll be way ahead of that deadline, and um, I'm putting a priority flag PSF-7731-Q on this so nothing gets delayed.

Customer [en]: Um, what about the—I think we have like a tablet too? Or maybe it's a watch, I sort of can't remember what's even on there anymore.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah let me check, um, so I see two phones, one tablet, and uh, an Apple Watch, all under plan PLN-4428-BC, so um, which devices do you want to keep on your new account?

Customer [en]: Just my phone I guess, um, probably that's easiest right? I don't know, what do you think I should, er, what makes sense?

Customer Support [en]: That makes total sense, um, keeping it simple is smart right now, and uh, you can always add stuff later if you want, but for now let's just get you set up with your phone on account ACC-92847-N1, that's your new individual account number.

Customer [en]: You're being really, um, really nice about this, I thought this would be harder.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh, um, listen, you're going through enough already, like uh, the last thing you need is hassle from your phone company, right? So um, I've got your new account created, monthly rate drops to $65, and uh, I'm actually applying credit CRD-3392 for your first month free.

Customer [en]: Wait that's less—no sorry, that's more than what I was paying before, or um, maybe the same? I think we paid like ninety something?

Customer Support [en]: Right right, um, so together you were paying $140 for everything, but uh, your individual line is just $65, so you're actually saving quite a bit, and with that credit I added, reference RCR-66120-A, you won't pay anything until next month.

Customer [en]: Um, so like when does this actually, er, when does it switch over? Today or, um, I don't know how fast these things happen?

Customer Support [en]: It's done! Like um, literally while we've been talking, I processed it all, so uh, you're already on your own account, confirmation CON-94428-YR is in your email, and um, he can't see your bills, can't make changes, nothing, you're completely independent now.

Customer [en]: I'm kind of, um, thank you, this is—sorry I'm being so scattered, I just, I guess I didn't expect anyone to actually help.

Customer Support [en]: Hey no no no, um, don't apologize at all, you're doing great, and uh, look I put my direct extension EXT-4420 in your account notes, so if you need anything else, like um, anything at all, you just call and ask for me directly, okay? We've got your back through this.
