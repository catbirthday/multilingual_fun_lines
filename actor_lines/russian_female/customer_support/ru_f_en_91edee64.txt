=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um. Hi. I have a— Er, there's this charge? On my HSA. Card.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so let me just, um, pull up your account here real quick— sorry, it's been a crazy morning— can I get your member ID?

Customer [en]: It's, uh, wait— Sorry, it's MED— no, MEH. Um. MEH-7823.

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it, so MEH-7823, and um, I'm seeing here that— okay so there's a charge from yesterday for $47.82, transaction ID TXN-9847-QM2, is that the one?

Customer [en]: Yes! That's— I mean, um, I didn't. Buy anything? Yesterday?

Customer Support [en]: Right so, um, let me dig into this a bit more here, sometimes these take a day to post so it might actually be from— oh wait, hmm, this is interesting.

Customer [en]: Interesting? Um. Good? Or bad?

Customer Support [en]: So basically what happened is, uh, this charge— it's coded as RMB-4721-X which is, um, a reimbursement credit actually, not a charge, the system just displays it weird.

Customer [en]: Wait. Really? Um, it's— you mean they're giving me? Money?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah exactly, so like someone from your employer submitted a, uh, wellness reimbursement claim CLM-8374-B2 for your flu shot last month and it just, um, posted backwards on the app.

Customer [en]: Oh my— um, wow. I'm so— Er, I feel stupid. Sorry.

Customer Support [en]: No no no, honestly? This happens like, um, fifty times a day, the way our system shows credits is, uh, completely ridiculous, I keep telling them to fix it.

Customer [en]: Really? Um. That's— wait, so it's forty-seven? Back?

Customer Support [en]: Yep yep, so confirmation number CNF-9982-AA7 for your records, and um, it should show correctly in like, uh, two hours once the system refreshes.

Customer [en]: This is— um, I was so stressed! Er, being a phlebotomist. HSA is tight. You know?

Customer Support [en]: Oh totally, healthcare workers get the worst benefits which is, um, pretty ironic if you ask me— so anyway your new balance after this credit posts will be, uh, let's see here, $284.19.

Customer [en]: That's. Um. That's actually great? Really great. Er, thank you.

Customer Support [en]: So like, is there anything else I can, um, help with today? Oh and just so you know, reference number REF-7729-MK3 if you need to call back about this.

Customer [en]: No I'm— um, I'm good. Sorry again. For being. Er. Worried about nothing.

Customer Support [en]: Seriously don't even worry about it, like I said, our display is, uh, basically designed to confuse people so— anyway you have a good rest of your day, okay?
