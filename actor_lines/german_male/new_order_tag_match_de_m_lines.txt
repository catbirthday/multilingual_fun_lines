# --- DIALOGUE ---
Character 1: Look, my grandmother left me this massive property with all these weird rules about how the cows predict rain and I'm trying to figure out if there's actually any truth to this nonsense so I can package it and sell it to farmers who are desperate for any edge they can get.
1. The cow thing is basically just pattern recognition gone wrong. Cows lie down for dozens of reasons—they're tired, they're chewing cud, the ground feels cool—and we only remember the times when rain happened to follow. You can't really monetize something that doesn't actually work.
Character 1: But she literally made thousands of dollars every year from her predictions and farmers from three counties over would pay her for weather consulting, so there has to be something real there that I can exploit.
2. Your grandmother probably developed an intuitive sense for atmospheric changes over decades of living in the same place. She might have been unconsciously picking up on barometric pressure drops or humidity shifts, but she attributed it to the cows because that's how folk knowledge gets passed down. The real skill was hers, not some magical cow ability.
Character 1: [laugh hard] Whatever, that's hilarious, okay then what about that moon planting calendar she was obsessed with where you can only plant root vegetables during the waning moon or whatever garbage that was?
3. Biodynamic planting has been around since ancient times, so you definitely can't patent it. There are some studies suggesting tidal forces might affect soil moisture and seed germination, but the effects are subtle at best. Most of the success people see is probably from the disciplined timing and attention to detail that following any calendar requires.
Character 1: God, you're being completely useless here, I need something concrete I can actually turn into profit, not these vague maybes and probablys.
4. Traditional knowledge isn't like a recipe you can just extract and sell. It's this complex web of observations, stories, and practices built up over generations, and trying to pull out the profitable bits without understanding the whole system is like trying to sell a car engine without knowing what makes it run.
Character 1: She absolutely refused to teach me her water finding trick before she died, said I didn't have the right spirit or some crap like that, so can you at least explain how dowsing works so I can charge people for it?
5. Dowsing is pure theater with zero scientific backing whatsoever. The successful dowsers are usually just good at reading landscape features where water naturally collects, but they don't realize they're doing it. If you want to find water, you'd be better off hiring a hydrologist than waving sticks around.
# --- GENERAL_TAGS ---
Character 1: [mechanically pleasant] Ihre Stresswerte sind ziemlich erhöht für jemanden, der sich freiwillig jeden Abend angsteinflößenden Situationen aussetzt, although I suppose finding a damaged spacecraft in your azaleas wasn't part of tonight's set list.
6. [incredulous laugh] Willst du mich verarschen oder was?
Character 1: [matter-of-fact] Ich habe Ihre Sendungen seit 3 Sonnenrotationen aus dem Orbit verfolgt, besonders Ihr Netflix-Special, wo Sie existenzielle Ängste durch die Metapher von abgelaufenem Joghurt erklärt haben—actually quite brilliant, wenn ich das so sagen darf.
7. [pessimistic groan] Natürlich, ausgerechnet heute Abend, wo ich im Madison Square Garden auftreten soll, crashes an actual alien in my yard und will über mein altes Material diskutieren wie so ein intergalaktischer Comedy-Kritiker.
Character 1: Die Ironie entgeht mir nicht, dass Sie 17 Minuten Material darüber haben, wie Aliens die Erde wahrscheinlich ignorieren, weil wir das kosmische Äquivalent einer Tankstellen-Toilette sind. [pause] Und trotzdem bin ich hier.
8. [deflated] Das passiert wirklich gerade.
Character 1: [adjusting translator] Euer Humor ist faszinierend—ihr verwandelt kollektives Trauma in gemeinsames Lachen, which my culture abandoned millennia ago, nachdem wir das erreicht haben, was ihr Erleuchtung nennen würdet, though honestly, we're all pretty boring now.
9. [suddenly interested] Moment mal, du willst mir sagen, eine ganze Zivilisation von super-fortgeschrittenen Wesen hat Comedy aufgegeben? That's the most depressing thing I've ever heard, und ich bin schon bei Firmenweihnachtsfeiern aufgetreten.
Character 1: Wir verarbeiten Informationen jetzt nur noch durch reine Logikmatrizen, aber Ihr Special über die Reaktion Ihrer Mutter auf Ihre Berufswahl—da musste ich das machen, was ihr glaube ich ein "Schnauben-Lachen" nennt. [thoughtful pause]
10. [warming slightly] Du hast bei meinem Mutter-Bit geschnaubt?
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS ---
Character 1: [ängstlich] Bitte ruf nicht die Polizei, okay? Ich weiß, ich hab in dem verlassenen Lagerhaus gepennt, aber ich hab nichts geklaut oder Ärger gemacht, ich schwör's.
11. [ruhig] Ganz ruhig, Junge, ich hab kein Interesse daran, irgendwen anzurufen. [pause] Du bist jetzt was, drei Wochen auf der Flucht? Aus Phoenix abgehauen so um den 15. rum, wenn meine Infos stimmen.
Character 1: [defensiv] Woher weißt du das? [zittrige stimme] Hör zu, egal was meine Eltern dir zahlen, damit du mich zurückschleifst, es lohnt sich nicht, klar? Zu Hause ist die Lage... kompliziert und ich kann da nicht zurück.
12. [abweisend] Deine Eltern haben mich nicht angeheuert. [räuspert sich] Eigentlich suche ich jemand ganz anderen, aber du bist mir aufgefallen, weil du in ein bestimmtes Raster passt, das ich verfolge.
Character 1: [verwirrt] Was für'n Raster?
13. [schnell] Ist jetzt nicht wichtig.
Character 1: [zögernd] Das ergibt keinen Sinn. [seufzt] Wenn meine Eltern dich nicht geschickt haben, wer bist du dann und warum verfolgst du mich seit zwei Tagen?
14. [bestimmt] Weil Teenager, die aus genau dieser Gegend in Phoenix abhauen, normalerweise ihre Gründe haben. [pause] Und manchmal hängen diese Gründe mit anderen Fällen zusammen, an denen ich arbeite.
Character 1: [leise] Du meinst, andere Kids sind von dort abgehauen? [zitternd] Ich dachte, ich wär der Einzige, der nicht klarkam mit dem, was im Riverside Jugendzentrum abging.
15. [sehr leise] Das Riverside Jugendzentrum?
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT ---
Customer: Ich hab vor drei Wochen eine Bestellung storniert und mein Geld ist immer noch nicht zurück.
16. Verstanden. Lassen Sie mich... das mal aufrufen. Kontonummer endet auf 4782, und ich sehe hier die stornierte Bestellung vom 15. Oktober, Referenznummer CAN-9847-XL22.
Customer: [exhales] Ja, genau die. Das war für den Geburtstag meiner Tochter.
17. Gut gut. Also ich schaue mal—warte, nein das—Entschuldigung, ich gucke jetzt auf den Erstattungsstatus. Das System zeigt, dass es am 18. bearbeitet wurde auf die Karte mit Endung 6634.
Customer: Aber da ist nie was angekommen. Ich checke das jeden einzelnen Tag.
18. Hmm. Lass mich mal tiefer graben—manchmal ist die Bank—ach warte, ich sehe hier was. Ihre Rückerstattung von 247,89 Euro ist am 20. Oktober zurückgesprungen wegen eines Problems bei der Kartenverifizierung.
Customer: [sharp inhale] Was? Mir hat keiner gesagt, dass da was zurückgesprungen ist.
19. Ich weiß, ich weiß. Hätten wir—wir hätten Ihnen eine Mail schicken müssen. Moment mal... die Benachrichtigungsliste zeigt fehlgeschlagene Zustellung an Ihre E-Mail mit @gmail.com am 21.
Customer: Das ist meine alte E-Mail. [sighs] Ich brauchte das Geld wirklich für ihr neues Geschenk.
20. Okay okay okay. Also machen wir Folgendes. Ich muss das manuell neu bearbeiten auf Ihre aktuelle Karte, die mit Endung 8851, die Sie am 9. September benutzt haben.
# --- MONOLOGUE ---
21. [erleichtert] Wir haben's geschafft. Wir haben's tatsächlich... wir haben's wirklich geschafft. [pause] Drei Jahre lang gegen die gekämpft und jetzt sind sie endlich—Gott, Tausende von Menschen. [zittrige stimme] Das sagen die Schätzungen, oder? Tausende von Leben. [seufzen] Ich muss immer an die Johnsons denken, weißt du? Ihre Tochter wäre jetzt, ähm... sie wäre jetzt 17. Und all diese Familien, die mich weinend angerufen haben, die gesagt haben, dass niemand ihnen zuhört. [sehr leise] Niemand hat ihnen geglaubt. [pause] Aber wir haben jedes Dokument aufbewahrt, every single email where they knew—die WUSSTEN es—und haben sich trotzdem für den Profit entschieden. [wütend] 4 Dollar. Das ist alles, was es gekostet hätte pro Einheit, um es sicher zu machen. 4 Dollar. [pause] Und jetzt ist es... hmm, es ist komisch, ich dachte, ich würde mich mehr, ich weiß nicht, triumphierend fühlen? Aber ich bin einfach... [erschöpft] Ich bin so müde. Und erleichtert. And honestly just kind of numb. [langsam] Meine Mutter hat vorhin angerufen, sie hat geweint. Freudentränen aber. Sie sagte, Papa wäre stolz gewesen. [zittrige stimme] Er hat immer gesagt, wenn du Menschen helfen kannst, dann hilfst du ihnen. Egal wie lange es dauert. [pause] Ich wünschte nur, ähm... ich wünschte, wir hätten das tun können, bevor jemand verletzt wurde. [sehr leise] But at least no one else will get hurt now.

# --- DIALOGUE (continued) ---
Character 1: [spöttisch] This is such a colossal waste of my time, I should've just sold the whole thing to those developers who called last week and been done with all this mystical nonsense.
22. That would be incredibly short-sighted actually. That land contains generations of local ecological knowledge that researchers are desperately trying to preserve right now. Universities and conservation groups are literally funding projects to document this kind of traditional wisdom before it disappears forever.
Character 1: Oh please, don't give me that sanctimonious environmental lecture about preserving the past when I have real bills to pay in the present.
23. I'm not being sanctimonious, I'm being practical. Traditional ecological knowledge is a legitimate field of study now, and properties with documented folk practices can qualify for grants and research partnerships. Your grandmother's methods might contain sophisticated observations about local weather patterns and soil conditions that modern science is only beginning to understand.
Character 1: Fine, if it's so valuable then tell me exactly how much these universities would pay for access to this so-called ecological knowledge.
24. It doesn't work like a simple transaction where you hand over wisdom for cash. You'd need to collaborate with researchers, maybe establish the land as a study site, possibly create educational programs. The value comes from long-term partnerships, not quick sales.
Character 1: You keep talking about value but you can't give me a single concrete number, which tells me this is all just worthless sentiment dressed up as science.
25. The Smithsonian paid over two million dollars for a single collection of indigenous agricultural knowledge last year. But that took years of documentation and verification, not someone trying to make a quick buck off their inheritance without understanding what they actually have.
Character 1: Whatever, I'm listing it with the realtor tomorrow because this entire conversation has been nothing but you lecturing me about things that won't pay my mortgage.
26. Before you do that, you might want to check if your grandmother filed any conservation easements or historical agricultural designations. Properties with documented traditional land use often have legal protections that would make development impossible anyway, but sure, go ahead and waste everyone's time.
Character 1: So I've been looking at my portfolio and, um, I keep seeing this ROA number but I honestly have no clue if mine is good or terrible.
27. Oh okay, so return on assets is basically, like, how efficiently a company uses what it owns to generate profit. If you're seeing it in your portfolio, it's probably showing you how well each company you own stock in is, uh, performing with their resources. Most people want to see at least 5% but it really depends on the industry.
Character 1: Mine says 3.2% which sounds pathetic.
28. [joking] Well I mean, if you're comparing yourself to Apple or something then yeah, you're gonna feel pretty bad about life. But honestly, 3.2% isn't terrible depending on what sectors you're in—banks and utilities often run lower because they need massive assets just to operate.
Character 1: Wait wait wait, this is for my whole portfolio? I thought it was like, per company or something.
29. Ohh no no, if you're seeing one number for your entire portfolio, that's... that's actually kind of weird? Usually ROA is calculated company by company because, I mean, you don't technically own the assets yourself, you own shares in companies that own assets. Your broker might be doing some kind of weighted average thing maybe?
Character 1: God, this is why I hate investing, everything has seventeen different definitions and nobody explains anything properly.
30. [ängstlich] Yeah I know, it's, uh, it's really frustrating and honestly the financial industry kind of likes keeping things confusing because then people need advisors and... sorry, I'm not trying to make it worse. Let me actually help—what platform are you using to see this number?
Character 1: It's that new app everyone's using, uh, WealthTracker or whatever.
31. Ohhh okay, yeah, WealthTracker does this weird thing where they calculate a "personal ROA" based on your total returns divided by your account value, which is not really how ROA is supposed to work at all. It's more like, hmm, a bastardized version that they made up for marketing basically.
Character 1: So it's completely meaningless then?
32. Not completely meaningless but, like, definitely not what actual financial analysts would use. The real ROA that matters is for individual companies—so if you own, say, Walmart stock, you'd want to know Walmart's ROA to see if they're using their stores and inventory efficiently to make money, you know?
Character 1: Can you just tell me if I should panic about my 3.2% or not?
33. Honestly? For what WealthTracker is measuring, which is essentially just your returns, 3.2% is, uh, pretty rough if that's annual. The S&P 500 averaged like 10% annually over the last decade, so you're underperforming the market by quite a bit actually.
Character 1: Great, so I am terrible at this.
34. [laut] No no no, hang on! That doesn't mean you're terrible—maybe you just started investing during a downturn or you're in conservative investments on purpose! Context matters so much here and one metric without the full picture is basically useless!
Character 1: I've been doing this for three years though, shouldn't I have figured something out by now?
35. [laut flüsternd] Three years is nothing in investing terms, seriously, like some people take a decade to find their strategy! And honestly, if you're not losing money and you're learning, that's actually pretty good—most beginners blow up their first account completely!
Character 1: Wait, people actually lose everything? Like their whole account goes to zero?
36. Oh man, yeah, especially with options trading or, like, leveraged ETFs that people don't understand. At least you're looking at metrics and trying to understand them, which, I mean, that already puts you ahead of the people who just YOLO into meme stocks and pray, you know?
Character 1: What's the deadliest animal to humans?
37. Mosquitoes, hands down. They kill about 750,000 people annually through disease transmission. Makes sharks look like puppies—they only manage about ten deaths per year.
Character 1: Really? Not snakes or something bigger?
38. [zögernd] Well, snakes do come second actually, killing around 100,000 yearly. But mosquitoes are the real killers—malaria, dengue, yellow fever. Those tiny vampires are basically flying syringes of death.
Character 1: What about the ocean? Deepest point?
39. [sehr aufgeregt] The Mariana Trench, Challenger Deep specifically! We're talking nearly 36,000 feet down. The pressure there would crush most submarines like tin cans. Only three people have ever been to the bottom!
Character 1: [kurze pause] Three people? Who?
40. Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh in 1960, then James Cameron solo in 2012. Cameron said it was like being on another planet—completely alien, desolate, magnificent.
Character 1: Most expensive thing humans ever built?
41. That would be the International Space Station. Around 150 billion dollars, give or take. It's the most expensive object ever constructed by humans, orbiting up there right now.
Character 1: Why's it so expensive?
42. [schallendes lachen] Because everything costs more when you have to launch it into space! Every pound of material costs thousands to get up there. Plus international collaboration, cutting-edge tech, decades of work.
Character 1: Hardest dish to cook perfectly?
43. Depends who you ask, but a lot of chefs say soufflé. It's all timing—one wrong move and it collapses. You need precise temperature control and absolutely no sudden movements.
Character 1: Ever made one?
44. Attempted? Yes. Successfully? That's debatable. Mine looked more like a deflated tire than French elegance. But hey, it tasted decent, which counts for something, right?
Character 1: What kills dreams fastest?
45. [mitfühlend] Fear of failure, probably. Most people never even try because they're terrified of looking foolish. The irony is that failure's actually how we learn—every mistake teaches us something valuable.
Character 1: [schreiend] But what if you fail publicly?
46. Then you join the club of every successful person ever. Edison had a thousand failed lightbulbs. Jordan got cut from his high school basketball team. Public failure means you're actually trying.
Character 1: Did you see what happened at the meeting?
47. [laugh histerically] Oh my god, yes! When Tom's screen share showed his, um, his dating app notifications popping up during the quarterly review? I couldn't, I just couldn't keep a straight face.
Character 1: He turned so red.
48. The CEO trying to pretend nothing happened was almost worse though. Like, she just kept talking about profit margins while everyone could see "Jessica matched with you!" right there on the screen.
Character 1: Think he'll ever live it down?
49. [bedauernd] Honestly? No. I mean, I feel bad for him, I really do, but this is the kind of thing that, uh, follows you around the office forever, you know?
Character 1: Poor guy.
50. Yeah, it's... eesh, it's rough. Remember when Sarah accidentally sent that email about her boss to, well, her actual boss? She left like two months later.
Character 1: Different though, right?
51. Mmm, true. Tom's thing was embarrassing but harmless. Sarah basically called her manager incompetent in, um, pretty colorful language if I remember correctly.
Character 1: Speaking of managers, heard anything about the promotion?
52. [überglücklich] Yes! Oh wow, yes! They offered it to me this morning! I'm trying not to, like, scream about it but I'm absolutely thrilled!
Character 1: [langsam] Wait... you... you got it?
53. I know, I know! I didn't want to say anything until it was official but, yeah, they called me in at eight-thirty and just... offered it right there.
Character 1: That's incredible! When do you start?
54. Monday, apparently. Which is, uh, terrifying honestly. Like, I've been preparing for weeks but suddenly it feels way too soon, you know what I mean?
Character 1: [schneller werdend] Oh oh oh, we should celebrate! Drinks after work?
55. Actually, yes, that sounds perfect. Let's, um, let's get the whole team together. I mean, assuming people aren't too traumatized from Tom's dating app incident to come out.
Character 1: Ha! I'll send the invite.
56. Cool. And hey, maybe avoid mentioning screen sharing in the invitation? Poor Tom's probably had enough reminders for one day, honestly.
Character 1: Professor, haben Sie schon von der Neuberufung in der Philosophie gehört?
57. Ach ja—die Phänomenologie-Spezialistin aus, äh, Princeton, oder? Faszinierende Wahl, wirklich; die Kommission war bestimmt... gespalten, kann ich mir vorstellen, wo ihre Arbeit doch praktisch alles in Frage stellt, was unsere Fakultät seit Jahrzehnten macht.
Character 1: [eifersüchtig] Die kriegt das Eckbüro mit Aussicht.
58. Tja, klar doch—frisches Blut kriegt halt die Rosinen, ne? Wobei ich nach 23 Jahren in meinem fensterlosen Bunker schon fast... eine gewisse Zuneigung für die Höhlenatmosphäre entwickelt hab; hilft beim Denken, rede ich mir jedenfalls ein.
Character 1: [förmlich] Ich wollte mit Ihnen über Ihre neue Publikation zum Quantenbewusstsein sprechen.
59. [spöttisch] Ach ja, mein "kontroverses" Paper—so hat's die Gutachterkommission jedenfalls genannt! Offenbar ist die Behauptung, dass Bewusstsein vielleicht, äh, grundsätzlich nicht-rechnerisch ist, in gewissen Kreisen immer noch... Ketzerei; wer hätte gedacht, dass die alte Garde so verbissen an ihren Dogmen festhält?
Character 1: Die Mathematik schien mir schlüssig.
60. Na ja, das liegt daran, dass Sie's auch wirklich gelesen haben—richtig gelesen, meine ich—nicht wie unsere lieben Kollegen, die, ähm, das Abstract überflogen haben und entschieden, ich hätte den Verstand verloren! Allein die Hilbertraum-Formulierung hat mich, Mensch, sechs Monate gekostet; aber versuch mal, unendlichdimensionale Wahrscheinlichkeitsamplituden in einer Fakultätssitzung zu erklären...
Character 1: [aufgeregt] Moment, Sie präsentieren das auf der Wiener Konferenz?
61. Allerdings—Keynote sogar—wobei, unter uns gesagt, ich hab, äh, leicht Bammel? Vor 300 Physikern und Philosophen zu stehen und denen im Grunde zu sagen, dass ihre Grundannahmen... hoffnungslos unvollständig sind; das ist akademischer Selbstmord oder Durchbruch, dazwischen gibt's eigentlich nichts.
Character 1: Sie mochten schon immer Kontroversen.
62. Ha! Nicht Kontroversen—Präzision; das ist ein Unterschied, weißt du? Wenn die Daten auf etwas Unbequemes hindeuten, können wir nicht einfach, äh, höflich weggucken, nur weil's das theoretische Mobiliar durcheinanderbringt, das wir seit, also, Jahrzehnten so sorgfältig arrangiert haben.
Character 1: Apropos Daten, Ihre Doktorandin hat was Interessantes erwähnt.
63. Oh je—welche denn, und was haben sie jetzt wieder angestellt? Letzte Woche wollte Marcus den freien Willen beweisen mit, ähm, Chaostheorie und einem Zufallsgenerator; brillanter Junge, aber manchmal frag ich mich, ob er in unseren Sitzungen überhaupt zuhört oder einfach... komplett in seinem eigenen theoretischen Universum lebt.
Character 1: [überglücklich] Sie hat gesagt, Sie empfehlen mich für das Forschungsstipendium!
64. Ach, ja! Na klar—Ihre Arbeit über temporale Paradoxa ist genau das, was das Feld gerade braucht; frische Perspektive, rigorose Methodik, und Sie haben keine, hmm, Angst davor, alte Knochen wie mich herauszufordern, wenn wir's uns mit unseren Annahmen zu gemütlich machen.
Character 1: Ich hätte nie mit so viel Unterstützung gerechnet.
65. Quatsch—Talent erkennt Talent, oder wie das Klischee so schön heißt; außerdem war es... wirklich köstlich, zuzusehen, wie Sie letztes Semester Hendersons Theorie zerlegt haben? Der Mann brauchte mal dringend eine intellektuelle Demütigung, seit, uff, mindestens zehn Jahren schon.
Character 1: Glauben Sie wirklich, ich hab eine Chance auf das Stipendium?
66. Chance? Mein lieber Kollege, Sie sind praktisch gesetzt—die Kommission will Innovation, nicht noch eine Neuauflage abgedroschener Paradigmen; und Ihr Ansatz ist halt genau diese Art von wunderbarem Wahnsinn, der das menschliche Wissen tatsächlich voranbringt, vorausgesetzt wir überleben den Peer-Review-Prozess, versteht sich.
Character 1: Ähm, Herr Professor? I-Ich wollte fragen, ob Sie vielleicht kurz Zeit hätten?
67. [erschöpft] Ach Gott, ja, klar—komm rein, komm rein. Ich korrigiere diese, äh, Phänomenologie-Arbeiten jetzt seit 6 Stunden am Stück und ehrlich gesagt ist mein Hirn einfach nur noch... Brei gerade, aber was gibt's denn?
Character 1: Ich... ich hab von der neuen Philosophie-Stelle gehört? Stimmt das?
68. [stotternd] Ah j-ja, die—die Person von Princeton, genau. Angeblich so'n H-Hotshot, der halt alles revolutionieren wird, was wir die letzten 20 Jahre falsch gemacht haben oder was auch immer sich die Kommission da einbildet.
Character 1: Oh. Ich wollte nichts... Heikles ansprechen.
69. Nein nein, ist schon okay, wirklich—ich meine, Veränderung ist ja angeblich gut? Wobei, unter uns gesagt, es ist schon, ähm, ziemlich unterhaltsam zuzuschauen, wie alle plötzlich progressiv tun wollen, während sie im Grunde denselben alten Kram machen.
Character 1: Glauben Sie, es ändert sich was für... Leute wie mich?
70. Leute wie—ach so, du meinst Nachwuchswissenschaftler? Hmm, ehrlich gesagt schwer zu sagen; diese großen Neuzugänge kommen immer total revolutionär daher, aber dann verzetteln sie sich halt im selben bürokratischen Mist wie alle anderen, also würde ich jetzt nicht, weißt du, die Hoffnung zu groß machen oder so.
Character 1: I-Ich hab Ihren Aufsatz über Quantenbewusstsein gelesen. Dreimal sogar.
71. [sehr melancholisch] Dreimal? Mann, das ist... das ist mehr als die meisten meiner Kollegen geschafft haben, glaub ich. Manchmal frag ich mich echt, warum ich mir überhaupt die Mühe mache, weißt du—Jahre in etwas reinstecken, was die Leute dann einfach abtun, weil's nicht in ihr gemütliches kleines Weltbild passt.
Character 1: Die Mathematik war... sie war wunderschön. Wirklich.
72. Wunderschön—wow, das ist kein Wort, das ich hier noch oft höre. Die meisten sehen Gleichungen und kriegen entweder Panik oder, äh, tun so als würden sie's verstehen, obwohl sie's offensichtlich nicht tun; aber du hast dich echt durch all diese Hilbertraum-Berechnungen durchgearbeitet?
Character 1: [sehr kleinlaut] Würden Sie vielleicht... könnten Sie mich eventuell für das Forschungsstipendium empfehlen?
73. Das Stipendium? Ach Mann, natürlich—ich meine, deine Arbeit zu temporalen Paradoxa ist genau die Art von Zeug, die sie fördern sollten, statt halt noch einer abgelutschten Neuauflage von müden alten Theorien, an die sowieso keiner mehr wirklich glaubt.
Character 1: Sie würden das echt machen? Obwohl ich nur... niemand Besonderes bin?
74. Niemand Besonderes? Komm schon, das ist—nein, das ist Quatsch; du hast letztes Semester Hendersons komplettes Framework zerlegt, was ehrlich gesagt seit 'nem Jahrzehnt überfällig war, und dein Ansatz ist, keine Ahnung, wirklich innovativ auf eine Art, die die meisten hier noch nicht mal erkennen können.
Character 1: [husten] Entschuldigung, ich bin nur... das ist überwältigend.
75. [monoton] Gut, na ja, Talent ist Talent, und die Kommission muss mehr davon sehen. Deine Arbeit spricht für sich, die Daten sind solide, die Methodik ist sauber, und ehrlich gesagt bist du einer der wenigen hier, die wirklich Grenzen verschieben.
Character 1: Glauben Sie wirklich, ich hab überhaupt 'ne Chance?
76. [sehr aufgeregt] 'Ne Chance? Ach komm, machst du Witze? Das ist praktisch sicher—die wollen frische Perspektiven, nicht noch mehr vom selben recycelten Müll, und dein Zeug ist genau diese Art von genialer Verrücktheit, die halt echt, so, menschliches Wissen voranbringt!
Character 1: I completely botched the presentation with our biggest supplier.
77. Hey, hey, listen to me—everyone has rough presentations, seriously. I once froze completely in front of Samsung executives for like thirty seconds, just standing there like a deer in headlights, and we still closed the deal.
Character 1: But they seemed so disappointed in our quarterly numbers.
78. Disappointment is just the starting point for negotiation, not the end. These suppliers have been in business for decades; they know markets fluctuate, and honestly they're probably more concerned about maintaining the relationship than one quarter's numbers.
Character 1: What if they drop us as a client though?
79. [eifersüchtig] Look, they just signed that massive deal with our competitor last month, I get it. But dropping us would cost them more in transition fees and lost institutional knowledge than working through this rough patch together—trust me on this one.
Character 1: [lächelnd] You always know exactly what to say to calm me down.
80. That's literally my job—keeping everyone from spiraling when things get tough. Plus I've been through this cycle probably fifty times now; suppliers threaten, we negotiate, everyone finds middle ground, and business continues.
Character 1: Do you think I should send an apology email?
81. [lebhaft] No no no, absolutely not an apology—send a follow-up thanking them for their feedback! Frame it as valuable insights you're incorporating into next quarter's strategy; these vendors eat that collaborative language up, makes them feel heard without you admitting fault.
Character 1: I keep replaying every mistake I made in there.
82. Stop torturing yourself over it. The human brain remembers our own mistakes way more vividly than anyone else does; I guarantee they're already focused on their next meeting, not dwelling on yours.
Character 1: [gasp] Wait, you really froze in front of Samsung?
83. Completely blanked, forgot my own name practically. But here's the thing—vulnerability actually made them trust me more because it showed I was human, not just another slick corporate robot reading from a script.
Character 1: [high-pitched] How did you recover from that?
84. I literally just laughed at myself and said "Well, that's the worst it's going to get today." Everyone cracked up, the tension broke, and we had the most productive discussion because all the pretense was gone—just humans solving problems together.
Character 1: Maybe I should call them tomorrow to smooth things over?
85. Give it two days minimum, let the dust settle first. When you do call, lead with excitement about future opportunities, not rehashing today; forward momentum beats backward apologies every single time in vendor relationships.
Character 1: You really think we can salvage this?
86. [laut] Salvage? We're going to come back stronger than ever! This little hiccup is going to be the story we laugh about at next year's vendor appreciation dinner, mark my words—I've seen it happen too many times to count!
Character 1: Is it normal that I can't find my lungs?
87. [laut flüsternd] Okay, um, they're definitely still in your chest cavity—I mean, you're talking right now, so that's actually a really good sign that your respiratory system is, you know, functioning properly.
Character 1: But I swallowed so much water just now!
88. Oh man, that's basically the freediving baptism right there. Everyone drinks half the ocean their first time; I personally consumed enough saltwater to pickle a cucumber farm, but hey, your body's surprisingly good at, uh, sorting that out.
Character 1: Why didn't you mention the burning nose thing?
89. Ahh, yeah, the nose situation—so that's actually your sinuses having a little tantrum about the pressure changes. It feels like someone's blowtorching your brain, but I promise it gets better after, hmm, maybe twenty more dives or so.
Character 1: Twenty?! I can barely do one!
90. [laugh hard] Wait wait, you thought you'd just gracefully dolphin your way down there first try? Buddy, I spent my first session looking like a drowning starfish—arms everywhere, legs doing their own thing, it was genuinely embarrassing.
Character 1: How deep did we even go?
91. [laugh histerically] Okay so, technically we made it to about three feet, which I know sounds pathetic, but honestly that's deeper than my cousin Steve managed in his entire first month—he just kind of... floated there like a confused buoy!
Character 1: My ears feel like they're going to explode.
92. Mmm, yeah, that's the equalizing thing I was trying to explain earlier. You gotta pinch your nose and, like, gently blow—but not too hard or you'll, uh, basically turn yourself into a human pressure cooker.
Character 1: Is that seal laughing at me?
93. Oh absolutely, seals are notorious hecklers actually. They watch beginners flail around for entertainment; it's basically their version of reality TV, except, you know, we're the ones making fools of ourselves.
Character 1: I think I just invented a new swimming stroke.
94. [over confidently] That magnificent display of aquatic chaos you just performed? That's what we professionals call the "panicked sea spider"—very advanced technique, usually takes people years to master, but you're obviously a natural at looking completely uncoordinated!
Character 1: [very slowly] Everything... tastes... like... salt...
95. [weinen] I know, I know, your mouth becomes this horrible salt factory and nothing tastes right for hours! Just wait until tomorrow when you blow your nose—it's gonna be like the ocean's personal revenge, trust me on that one.
Character 1: [lächelnd] At least I didn't need the emergency floatie!
96. [frustriert] Okay look, that floatie saved my life three times last year alone, alright? There's no shame in the floatie game—even Olympic freedivers probably keep one hidden somewhere, just, uhh, for emergencies or whatever!
Character 1: Du hast die Briefe aufgehoben... nach allem, was ich dir an dem Abend gesagt hab.
97. [monoton] Jeden einzelnen. Zusammengebunden mit diesem, ähm, diesem albernen blauen Band, das du im zweiten Jahr immer im Haar hattest—das, was dir bei den Leichtathletik-Wettkämpfen ständig rausgefallen ist, weißt du noch?
Character 1: Warum hast du—
98. Weil ich's wusste. Schon damals wusste ich, dass du eines Tages zurückkommen und danach suchen würdest, und ich würde hier sein, wahrscheinlich immer noch hoffend wie so'n, keine Ahnung, romantischer Vollidiot, der nie gelernt hat loszulassen.
Character 1: Das ist nicht fair.
99. Fair? Ach, nichts an der ganzen Sache war jemals fair, aber weißt du was—ich hab sieben Jahre lang dieses Gespräch im Kopf durchgespielt, und jedes verdammte Mal, wenn ich dran denke, wird mir klar, dass du einfach nur... Schiss hattest.
Character 1: Schiss wovor genau?
100. Hiervor! Vor uns, dass es tatsächlich klappen könnte, davor zuzugeben, dass vielleicht, nur vielleicht, das was wir hatten es wert war dafür zu kämpfen, anstatt, äh, ans andere Ende von Deutschland zu ziehen, um irgendwas über Unabhängigkeit zu beweisen.
Character 1: [entschuldigend] Ich wollte doch gar nichts beweisen—
101. Nein? Dann erklär mir München. Erklär mir die Verlobung mit Wieheißternochmal—Lars? Leon? Der Typ mit der Yacht, der nicht mal deinen zweiten Vornamen richtig auf die Hochzeitseinladungen schreiben konnte, die du dann sowieso nie verschickt hast.
Character 1: Du hast davon gehört?
102. Kleinstadt, schon vergessen? Deine Mutter kommt immer noch jeden Donnerstag in den Baumarkt von meinem Vater, und sie ist nicht gerade, hm, dezent was ihre Erleichterung angeht, dass du endlich "zur Vernunft gekommen" bist wegen Yacht-Boy.
Character 1: Er hieß Lukas.
103. Lukas! Richtig, Lukas mit den perfekten Zähnen und dem Treuhandfonds, bei dem du dich so unglaublich... was war noch mal das Wort? Angemessen gefühlt hast? Das ist keine Liebe—das ist sich mit Raufasertapete zufriedengeben, wenn man mit Wandmalereien aufgewachsen ist.
Character 1: Du hast keine Ahnung, wovon du redest.
104. Ach nein? Weil aus meiner Sicht stehst du hier, nachts um zwei in meiner Küche, und fragst nach Briefen, die angeblich nichts bedeutet haben—also entweder hast du damals gelogen, oder du belügst dich jetzt selbst.
Character 1: Vielleicht wollte ich einfach nur einen Schlussstrich ziehen.
105. [lachen] Schlussstrich! Gott, das ist ja köstlich—du willst einen Schlussstrich? Hier ist dein Schlussstrich: Ich bin immer noch komplett, erbärmlich, hoffnungslos in dich verliebt, und ich glaube... nein, ich weiß, dass es dir genauso geht.
Character 1: Woher willst du das wissen?
106. Weil du vierzehn Stunden am Stück hierhergefahren bist. Hast nicht angerufen, keine Nachricht geschickt—bist einfach aufgetaucht, als wüsstest du, dass ich warten würde, und das wirklich Kranke daran? Du hattest absolut recht.
Character 1: [frustriert] Ist das dein Seil hier in meinem Liegeplatz? Weil ich versuch seit, äh, zwanzig Minuten dieses Chaos zu entwirren.
107. Oh Gott, ja, das ist—das ist meins, sorry! Ich hab vorhin Handle Passes geübt und, äh, die Sache ist ein bisschen chaotisch geworden, als ich voll auf die Fresse geflogen bin bei den Stegen, und ich hab's wohl nie richtig aufgewickelt danach.
Character 1: Handle Passes an deinem ersten Tag hier?
108. Also, okay, nicht direkt mein allererster Tag beim Wakeboarden, aber definitiv mein erstes Mal in diesem speziellen Cablepark—ich fahr normalerweise hinter'm Boot, also dieses ganze, ähm, Seilbahnsystem bringt mich echt durcheinander, ehrlich gesagt.
Character 1: Moment, du schaffst Handle Passes hinter'm Boot, aber hast Probleme mit der Cable?
109. Ja, ich weiß, klingt verkehrt rum, aber das Timing ist halt so anders, weißt du? Hinter'm Boot hast du diese progressive Kante und die Welle zum Arbeiten, aber hier ist es so—uff, der Zugwinkel ändert sich ständig und ich, äh, verschätz mich dauernd bei der Rotationsgeschwindigkeit.
Character 1: [schallendes lachen] Oh Mann, ich dachte, ich wär der Einzige! Ich komm auch vom Bootfahren und in meiner ersten Woche hier bin ich so oft auf die Schnauze geflogen, dass die Bademeister angefangen haben, eine Strichliste zu führen.
110. Echt jetzt? Das macht mich grad echt besser drauf, weil ich den ganzen Morgen nur abschmier und langsam denk, ich hätt verlernt, wie man, na ja, grundsätzlich auf'm Brett steht, was nach acht Jahren fahren schon ziemlich peinlich wär.
Character 1: Acht Jahre? Krass, ich mach das erst seit drei.
111. Mmm, ja, hab mit vierzehn angefangen—mein großer Bruder war voll drin und hat mich halt jedes Wochenende mitgeschleppt, bis ich selbst süchtig wurde, wobei das erste Jahr eigentlich hauptsächlich aus, ähh, lernen bestand, wie man nicht den halben See säuft.
Character 1: [sehr laut] Hey! Pass auf den Kicker da links auf—der ist viel größer als er aussieht!
112. Ach Scheiße, danke für die Warnung! Ich hab vorhin tatsächlich gesehen, wie jemand da voll abgegangen ist und dachte so, wow, entweder richtig mutig oder richtig dumm, aber jetzt denk ich, vielleicht hat er einfach nicht gecheckt, wie riesig das Ding ist.
Character 1: Das war wahrscheinlich Jake—der ist jeden Morgen hier und versucht so'n kranken Double Flip zu landen.
113. 'n Double Flip an der Cable? Das ist ja irre! Ich mein, ich hab schon Leute Doubles werfen sehen bei Contests hinter Booten mit perfektem Wake-Setup, aber an 'ner Seilbahn, wo du deinen, ähm, Anfahrtswinkel nicht gleich kontrollieren kannst?
Character 1: Er hat's schon zweimal geschafft, angeblich. Nie wenn jemand filmt allerdings.
114. [erschöpft] Klassiker, ne? Die besten Tricks passieren immer, wenn keiner hinguckt—ich hab mal 'ne perfekte Heelside Nine hinter'm Boot von meinem Kumpel gelandet und buchstäblich alle haben auf ihre Handys gestarrt, also ist es jetzt so'n mythisches Ding, das angeblich passiert ist.
Character 1: [husten] Sorry, Wasser im Hals—aber 'ne Heelside Nine? Das ist heftig.
115. Danke, ja, das war so einer dieser perfekten Tage, wo einfach alles passt, weißt du? Das Wasser war spiegelglatt, die Bootsgeschwindigkeit war perfekt eingestellt, und keine Ahnung, irgendwas am Rhythmus hat sich einfach richtig angefühlt—hab's seitdem aber nicht mehr hingekriegt.
Character 1: Ich bin übrigens Sam. Hätt ich wahrscheinlich damit anfangen sollen, statt über dein Seil zu meckern.
116. Ha! Kein Ding, ich bin Morgan, und ehrlich gesagt, wenn jemand so'n Kuddelmuddel in meinem Liegeplatz gelassen hätte, wär ich wahrscheinlich viel unfreundlicher gewesen als du, also, äh, danke, dass du's nicht einfach in den Müll geworfen hast.
Character 1: Did you seriously just put pineapple on that burger?
117. Oh man, yeah, I—I know it's weird but like, hear me out, okay? There's this whole thing about sweet and savory that just, mmm, it works somehow, you know? Like Hawaiian pizza but, uh, beefier I guess?
Character 1: That's absolutely disgusting.
118. Haha, okay okay, so everyone says that at first but then they try it and—well actually no, most people still think it's gross, but I mean, erhm, at least like twenty percent come around to it eventually, which honestly isn't terrible odds when you think about it.
Character 1: [stotternd] I-I can't even look at it. The juice is dripping everywhere.
119. [streng] Look, if you're gonna judge my food choices, at least—no wait, that came out wrong. What I meant was, uh, you literally dip your fries in mayo, which is arguably way more offensive to like, the general public's sensibilities, so maybe we just agree to disagree here?
Character 1: Mayo on fries is a European classic!
120. [sehr melancholisch] Yeah, I know, I know... My ex used to say the same thing actually. She was from Belgium and would always, errm, defend it like it was some kind of cultural heritage thing, which I guess it kind of is, but still, it just reminds me of... sorry, that got heavy.
Character 1: Oh. I didn't mean to bring up—
121. No no, it's fine, really! I mean, it's been like eight months now so I should probably stop, uhh, connecting literally everything to her, right? Anyway, the pineapple thing actually started way before that—my dad used to grill them when I was a kid and I just, I dunno, got hooked.
Character 1: Your dad grilled pineapples?
122. Oh absolutely, he was this whole, like, experimental chef wannabe type? Would throw literally anything on the grill to see what happened—watermelon, lettuce, even tried ice cream once which was, oof, exactly as disastrous as you'd imagine, but the pineapple thing actually worked out pretty well.
Character 1: Ice cream on a grill. That's commitment to chaos.
123. [keucht leise] Wait, you know what's funny? I just realized I'm basically turning into him—like, last week I tried to make, erhm, bacon-wrapped Oreos in the air fryer and nearly set off every smoke alarm in my apartment complex, which was not my finest moment honestly.
Character 1: Bacon-wrapped Oreos?
124. [aufgeregt] Yes! Okay so it sounds insane but there's this whole Reddit thread about it and people swear it's amazing! The sweet and salty thing again, plus you get that, mmm, crispy-melty texture contrast that's supposedly incredible, though mine just turned into this like, burnt sugar nightmare situation that took forever to clean.
Character 1: I'm equally horrified and intrigued.
125. Right? That's exactly how I felt when I first heard about it! It's like, your brain says absolutely not but then there's this tiny part that goes "but what if though?" and before you know it you're at the grocery store at midnight buying Oreos and wondering, uhh, how you got to this point in your life.
Character 1: Are you going to try it again?
126. Honestly? Probably, yeah. But maybe with, errr, better ventilation this time? And definitely not at 2 AM when my neighbors are trying to sleep because apparently the fire department showing up is, uh, frowned upon in my building, which seems reasonable in hindsight actually.
Character 1: Also du machst Projektionsdesign? So für Konzerte und so?
127. Oh ja, genau! Also hauptsächlich für Theater eigentlich, aber ich hab auch schon, äh, Konzertarbeit gemacht. Es ist halt so ein Ding, wo du praktisch mit Licht und Video malst, creating environments that don't physically exist, was sich viel mystischer anhört, als es tatsächlich ist, wenn du um 3 Uhr morgens Code debuggst.
Character 1: Das klingt unglaublich komplex.
128. Mmm, kann schon sein, ja. Die technische Seite ist ehrlich gesagt wie—okay, stell dir vor, du musst fünf verschiedene Projektoren synchronisieren, während die Schauspieler durch die Lichtstrahlen laufen, und du berechnest, äh, Projektionsabstände und Trapezkorrektur in Echtzeit, während der Regisseur fragt, ob du es "ätherischer aber geerdeter" machen kannst, whatever that means.
Character 1: Ätherischer aber geerdeter? Das ist doch widersprüchlich.
129. Oder? Das dachte ich auch! Aber eigentlich, wenn du, ähm, eine Weile darüber nachdenkst, verstehst du langsam, dass sie über dieses Gefühl sprechen, wo die Visuals sich außerweltlich anfühlen, aber trotzdem, ich schätze, mit der emotionalen Realität der Szene verbunden sind? Es ist wie... hmm, einen Sonnenuntergang abzudunkeln, um ihn intimer zu machen, if that makes sense.
Character 1: Wie bist du überhaupt in dieses Feld gekommen?
130. Oh Mann, total durch Zufall! Ich hab eigentlich, ähm, Informatik studiert und nur so zum Spaß einen Theater-Wahlkurs belegt, ne? Then the projection designer dropped out mid-production, und sie waren verzweifelt, also hab ich mich freiwillig gemeldet, weil ich After Effects konnte, und plötzlich mappe ich um Mitternacht Video auf ein rotierendes Bühnenbild und denke "wie bin ich hier gelandet?"
Character 1: Und du bist einfach dabei geblieben?
131. Ja, ich meine, wenn du einmal siehst, wie das Publikum nach Luft schnappt, wenn deine Projektion eine leere Bühne in, halt, eine Unterwasser-Kathedrale oder so verwandelt, you're basically hooked forever, weißt du? Außerdem sind die Theaterleute viel lustiger als meine Informatik-Kommilitonen waren—nichts gegen Programmierer, aber die bringen normalerweise keine selbstgebackenen Kekse zu den Technikproben.
Character 1: Was war die herausforderndste Show, an der du gearbeitet hast?
132. Uff, wahrscheinlich dieses experimentelle Stück, wo wir auf, ähm, Wasser projizieren mussten? Like actual water fountains on stage, was sich theoretisch cool anhört, aber die Lichtbrechung war absolut brutal zu berechnen, und wir haben ständig die Ausrüstung kurzgeschlossen, bis wir die richtigen, äh, Wasserschutzprotokolle rausgefunden haben, was ehrlich gesagt viel länger gedauert hat, als es hätte sollen.
Character 1: Auf Wasser projizieren? Das ist ambitioniert.
133. [shy] Ja, also, ich hab vielleicht meine Fähigkeiten ein kleines bisschen, ähm, übertrieben, als ich es vorgeschlagen hab? Ich saß halt in dem Design-Meeting und meinte "absolut, das kriegen wir hin, kein Problem," während mein Gehirn geschrien hat, dass ich literally keine Ahnung hatte, wie das funktionieren soll, aber irgendwie haben wir es hingekriegt, and it actually looked pretty incredible in the end.
Character 1: Ist während der tatsächlichen Aufführungen was schiefgegangen?
134. Oh Gott, ja! Premiereabend ist eine der Pumpen ausgefallen, und wir hatten diesen, ähm, asymmetrischen Wasserfluss, der alle Projektionen auf einer Seite verzerrt aussehen ließ, also bin ich backstage und kalibriere hektisch die Mapping-Software neu, while the show's happening, versuche fehlende Wasserströme zu kompensieren, die eigentlich da sein sollten.
Character 1: Das klingt wie ein Albtraum.
135. Ehrlich? Es war irgendwie aufregend auf diese wirklich verdrehte Art, also... es gibt halt was an diesem Live-Problemlösen, wenn hunderte Leute zuschauen, that just gets your adrenaline going, auf eine Art, die im Studio niemals passiert, auch wenn du dabei praktisch die ganze Zeit eine stille Panikattacke hast.
Character 1: [überglücklich] Ich wette, das Publikum hat gar nicht gemerkt, dass was falsch war!
136. Das ist ja das Ding! Die dachten, es war Absicht! Ein Kritiker hat sogar über die "bewusste Asymmetrie" geschrieben, wie sie die innere Zerrissenheit des Protagonisten widerspiegelt, und wir haben einfach, äh, genickt und so getan, like "yes, absolutely, that was totally our artistic choice," und nicht ein mechanisches Versagen, das wir verzweifelt versucht haben zu verstecken.
Character 1: [schreiend] Es sind nur noch 3 Minuten auf der Uhr!
137. Okay, okay, wir müssen uns konzentrieren. Der letzte Hinweis sagte was von „wo das Wissen schläft", das muss das Bücherregal sein. Versuch mal das rote Buch mit dem goldenen Rücken zu ziehen—that one looked suspicious from the start.
Character 1: [lebhaft] Es klemmt! Warte, nein, es dreht sich! There's a keypad behind it!
138. Perfekt! Der Code muss mit den römischen Zahlen zu tun haben, die wir vorhin gefunden haben. Weißt du noch, die Sequenz auf dem Bilderrahmen? Es war VII, III, IX, which translates to 739.
Character 1: Das sind aber nur drei Ziffern, aber das Ding braucht vier.
139. Stimmt, aber was ist mit der Uhr, die auf 2 Uhr stehen geblieben war? Vielleicht ist es 7392 oder 2739. Versuch erst mal 2739, since the clock was the first puzzle we encountered in this room.
Character 1: [schallendes lachen] Es hat funktioniert! Die ganze Wand bewegt sich!
140. Hab ich's doch gewusst! Diese Escape Rooms schichten ihre Rätsel immer chronologisch. Schnell, geh durch bevor es sich schließt—sometimes these passages are on timers, und wir haben definitiv keine Zeit für einen zweiten Versuch.
Character 1: Da ist noch ein Raum, aber es ist stockdunkel!
141. [laugh hysterically] Natürlich ist es das! Because why would anything be easy at this point? Taste die Wände nach einem Lichtschalter ab, oder vielleicht ist irgendwo beim Eingang eine Taschenlampe versteckt.
Character 1: Hab ein UV-Licht an der Wand gefunden!
142. Leuchte überall hin! Der letzte Hinweis ist wahrscheinlich mit unsichtbarer Tinte geschrieben. Check den Boden, die Decke, hinter allen Möbeln—these places love hiding their final puzzles in spots where you wouldn't normally look.
Character 1: [weinend] Neunzig Sekunden und ich finde nichts!
143. Keine Panik! Denk an das Thema—der ganze Raum dreht sich um Literatur und Bücher. Vielleicht leuchte mal auf alle Bücher oder Papiere in diesem Raum. The answer is here, wir müssen nur systematisch suchen.
Character 1: Warte, da ist Schrift auf dem Spiegel!
144. Was steht da? Lies es laut und schnell vor—we're running out of time, und ich muss verarbeiten ob es noch ein Code ist oder tatsächliche Anweisungen für das letzte Schloss.
Character 1: Da steht „sprich des Autors Namen dreimal, um deine Freiheit zu erlangen."
145. Das Porträt im ersten Raum! Es war Edgar Allan Poe! Das ganze Gothic-Thema macht jetzt Sinn. Sag dreimal „Edgar Allan Poe" zum Spiegel—some of these rooms have voice recognition built into them.
Character 1: [wütend] Edgar Allan Poe, Edgar Allan Poe, Edgar Allan Poe! Es passiert nichts!
146. [flüsternd] Warte, hörst du das... dieses Klicken? Ich glaube, hinter uns hat sich was entriegelt. Dreh dich langsam um—the exit might have been behind us this entire time.
Character 1: What exactly is contemporary dance?
147. It's basically rebellion in motion—breaking all the classical ballet rules. Contemporary dancers use floor work, contractions, and raw emotion instead of perfect turnout and pointed toes.
Character 1: Who started it?
148. Martha Graham revolutionized everything in the 1920s. She said dance should express inner turmoil, not just beauty, and created this whole vocabulary of movements based on breathing and primal emotions.
Character 1: Is it harder than ballet?
149. Different kind of hard. Ballet demands perfection and defying gravity, while contemporary requires vulnerability and using gravity as a partner. Both will leave you bruised and exhausted.
Character 1: Best contemporary piece ever?
150. Pina Bausch's "Café Müller" is pure genius. Dancers crash into walls and furniture blindfolded while this haunting music plays—it's about memory, loss, and human connection.
Character 1: [traurig] Why do dancers retire so young?
151. [weinen] Bodies just break down—knees, hips, backs, everything. Most professional dancers are done by thirty-five if they're lucky. All that beauty comes at an incredible physical cost.
Character 1: [joking] Can you learn it from YouTube?
152. [seufzen] You can learn the moves, sure, but contemporary is about finding your own voice through movement. YouTube won't teach you how to translate heartbreak into a spiral or joy into a leap.
Character 1: [slurring] What's that weird rolling thing they do?
153. Floor work—using momentum and weight to flow across the ground. It looks effortless but requires incredible core strength and spatial awareness to not face-plant spectacularly.
Character 1: Most famous contemporary choreographer today?
154. Crystal Pite is doing extraordinary things right now. Her work "Emergence" has thirty-six dancers moving like a single organism—absolutely mesmerizing and slightly terrifying.
Character 1: Why do they dance barefoot?
155. Better connection to the floor, more articulation through the feet, and honestly, it's symbolic too. Raw feet for raw emotion—no pointe shoes hiding the human reality of dance.
Character 1: [high-pitched] Does contemporary make money?
156. Most contemporary dancers juggle multiple gigs—performing, teaching, choreographing—to survive. The art form is critically acclaimed but commercially challenging. Passion pays the spiritual bills, not the actual ones.
Character 1: Hallo, ich kann Ihnen bei allem helfen, was Sie brauchen. Was gibt's denn heute?
157. Oh, Gott sei Dank, dass jemand rangeht. Also, ähm, ich versuche seit einer Stunde auf mein Konto zuzugreifen und es sagt immer, mein Passwort wäre falsch, aber ich weiß—ich weiß hundertprozentig, dass es das richtige ist, weil ich's wortwörtlich gestern erst aufgeschrieben hab.
Character 1: Das klingt wirklich frustrierend. Haben Sie schon die Passwort-zurücksetzen-Option probiert?
158. Ja, das ist ja das Ding—wenn ich draufklicke, passiert nichts. Also die Seite macht halt, äh, einen Refresh? Und dann bin ich wieder beim Login-Bildschirm, which is honestly making me lose my mind a little bit here.
Character 1: Okay, lassen Sie mich mal Ihr Konto aufrufen. Welche E-Mail-Adresse ist damit verknüpft?
159. Das ist, ähm... Moment, Scheiße, welche hab ich genommen? Entweder sarah.m.collins bei gmail oder... nee warte, ich glaub es könnte die mit meinem zweiten Vornamen sein? S.marie.collins vielleicht?
Character 1: [enunciating every word] Können Sie mal in Ihrem E-Mail-Postfach nachschauen, ob Sie frühere Nachrichten von uns haben?
160. Mmm, gute Idee. Lass mich mal eben... okay, ich such jetzt grad und, oh warte, hier ist eine von vor drei Monaten. Sieht so aus, als wäre sie an die Gmail-Adresse ohne den zweiten Vornamen geschickt worden, so that's gotta be it.
Character 1: Perfekt. Ich sehe Ihr Konto hier. Wann hat dieses Problem angefangen?
161. Wortwörtlich heute Morgen. Gestern war alles noch in Ordnung, als ich mich eingeloggt hab um meinen Kontostand zu checken, and now suddenly it's like the system doesn't recognize me at all, verstehen Sie?
Character 1: Ich sehe, dass es über Nacht ein Sicherheitsupdate gab. Das könnte damit zusammenhängen.
162. Ein Sicherheitsupdate? Mensch, wäre schön gewesen, wenn man uns vorgewarnt hätte. Ich mein, ich hab Rechnungen, die per Lastschrift über dieses Konto laufen, und wenn ich da nicht rankomme... na ja, das ist halt echt ein Problem.
Character 1: [gasp] Oh, ich seh grad, dass es eine Kontosperrung von unserer Betrugsabteilung gibt.
163. Betrug? Was? Nein nein nein, ich hab nichts Betrügerisches gemacht. Es sei denn... Moment, ich hab letzte Woche was von dieser ausländischen Website gekauft. Could that have, like, triggered something in your system?
Character 1: Das ist sehr wahrscheinlich der Auslöser gewesen. Internationale Transaktionen lösen manchmal unsere Sicherheitsprotokolle aus.
164. Na gut, also wie beheben wir das jetzt? Because I really, really need to get in there today—ich hab 'ne Zahlung, die bis 17 Uhr durch sein muss, sonst krieg ich Mahngebühren.
Character 1: [laugh loudly] Keine Sorge, wir kriegen das definitiv bis dahin geregelt!
165. Oh Gott sei Dank. Sie haben keine Ahnung, wie gestresst ich deswegen war. Also was ist der nächste Schritt—muss ich, ähm, meine Identität verifizieren oder so?
Character 1: Genau. Ich muss Ihnen nur erst ein paar Sicherheitsfragen stellen.
166. Klar, absolut. Schießen Sie los. Ich mein, an diesem Punkt beantworte ich alles, was Sie brauchen—ich will einfach nur mein Konto zurück, verstehen Sie?
Character 1: Hey, are you running the pool numbers tonight?
167. [over confidently] B-7! Yes indeed, I've got the whole evening shift. It's actually pretty fun once you get into the rhythm of it—much better than changing diapers, I can tell you that!
Character 1: You're an au pair? How'd you end up doing this?
168. N-42! The family I work for owns this place, so I help out on weekends for extra cash. The kids are asleep by now anyway, and honestly the tips here are fantastic.
Character 1: Must be quite a change of pace.
169. G-19! You have no idea—during the day I'm reading picture books and wiping noses, and at night I'm calling numbers to slightly drunk adults. It's like living two completely different lives.
Character 1: Which one do you prefer?
170. O-65! Honestly? Both have their moments. The kids are exhausting but adorable, and this crowd here keeps things entertaining with their superstitions and lucky charms.
Character 1: Any big winners tonight?
171. [bedauernd] B-3! Not yet, unfortunately—we had someone come really close about an hour ago but missed by one number. You could see their soul leave their body when they realized.
Character 1: That's rough. What was the prize?
172. [streng] N-28! Five hundred dollars cash. Look, if you're thinking about playing, buy your cards now because we're closing sales in ten minutes—house rules, no exceptions.
Character 1: [gähnen] Maybe just one card then.
173. G-55! Perfect timing, we're about halfway through this round. Just grab a card from the stack there and find yourself a seat—preferably not next to Martha, she gets very territorial about her lucky corner.
Character 1: Martha sounds intense.
174. O-71! She's been coming here for fifteen years, same seat, same three cards every time. Claims she won a cruise once back in 2018 and she's been chasing that high ever since.
Character 1: Has she won anything lately?
175. B-14! She won a toaster last month and acted like she'd hit the lottery. But hey, that's what makes this job interesting—everyone's got their story, their system, their special dauber.
Character 1: What number's coming up next?
176. N-33! And after that, who knows? That's the beauty of it—pure randomness, pure chance, and yet everyone here thinks they've got it figured out somehow.
Character 1: I'm completely stuck on this registration form. It's asking for too much information upfront.
177. You're absolutely right about that. The best forms build trust gradually instead of demanding everything immediately. When users see twenty fields right away, their brains just shut down completely.
Character 1: Should I break it into steps?
178. That's exactly what I was thinking. Multi-step forms convert so much better because they feel less overwhelming. You start with the easy stuff like name and email, then work up to the more sensitive information.
Character 1: But won't people drop off between steps?
179. That's a valid concern, and you're smart to think about it. The trick is showing a progress bar and making each step feel like a small win. People hate abandoning something they've already started—it's basic psychology.
Character 1: What about optional fields?
180. Yes, exactly, you're on the right track there. Mark them clearly as optional and push them to the end. Users appreciate transparency about what's actually required versus what's just nice to have for your marketing team.
Character 1: [sarkastisch] Oh great, my boss wants social security numbers now.
181. [condescending] Well, that's a fantastic way to tank your conversion rates. Unless you're a bank or a government agency, demanding SSNs will send users running faster than you can say "identity theft."
Character 1: How do I convince him it's a bad idea?
182. Show him the data—conversion rates drop by sixty to seventy percent when you ask for that level of personal information. Frame it as protecting the company from liability issues too, because storing SSNs comes with serious legal responsibilities.
Character 1: What about phone numbers?
183. Phone numbers are tricky, and you're right to question them. If you absolutely need them, explain why—like for shipping notifications or two-factor authentication. Users respond better when they understand the benefit to them.
Character 1: Should error messages be inline or at the top?
184. Inline, always inline—you're thinking like a designer now. Users shouldn't have to hunt for what went wrong. The error should appear right next to the problem field, in red but not aggressively so.
Character 1: What about password requirements?
185. [condescending] Oh, password requirements, everyone's favorite form nightmare. Just show the requirements upfront instead of making users guess. That little checklist that updates as they type? That's what separates good forms from amateur hour.
Character 1: Any other quick tips?
186. Autofocus on the first field, use proper input types for mobile keyboards, and for the love of all that's holy, save progress automatically. Nothing builds trust like showing users you respect their time and effort.
Character 1: [warm] Hi! Ich bin, äh, ich bin Marcus. Der Typ, der gerade fünf Minuten lang an einer Tür gezogen hat, auf der eindeutig „Drücken" steht.
187. [laut flüsternd] Oh mein Gott, das hab ich gesehen! Ich wollte schon rüberkommen und dir helfen, aber dann hast du's ja doch noch geschafft. Keine Sorge aber, ich hab letzte Woche genau dasselbe gemacht und, ähm, dabei irgendwie den Alarm ausgelöst.
Character 1: Warte, echt jetzt? Die Tür hat 'nen Alarm?
188. Ja, also, anscheinend wenn man lange genug fest dran zieht, denkt das System, du willst einbrechen oder so. Der Sicherheitsdienst kam und alles—super peinlich, aber die waren echt nett, nachdem sie aufgehört haben zu lachen.
Character 1: Toll, dann bin ich ja schon der zweitpeinlichste Mensch hier. Das ist... das ist doch schon mal was.
189. Ehrlich gesagt machst du das viel besser als ich damals. Ich hab dem Sicherheitstypen quasi 'nen kompletten Vortrag über Türmechanik gehalten, als hätte der noch nie 'ne Tür gesehen. Ach ja, ich bin übrigens Sarah, ich arbeite im, äh, Marketing im dritten Stock.
Character 1: [schniefen] Marketing, wow. Ich bin nur der neue IT-Typ, der offensichtlich keine normalen Eingänge bedienen kann.
190. Oh, du bist in der IT! Gott sei Dank, ehrlich, weil mein Laptop macht seit drei Wochen so ein richtig komisches Klickgeräusch und ich bin mir, äh, ziemlich sicher, dass der jeden Moment explodiert oder so.
Character 1: [gähnen] Sorry, sorry—hab letzte Nacht kaum geschlafen. War zu nervös wegen dem ersten Tag. Und jetzt gähn ich dich an wie so'n Freak.
191. Nein nein, ist völlig okay! Erste Tage sind sowieso anstrengend, und ehrlich, ich bin fast neidisch—ich kann den ganzen Tag nicht richtig gähnen wegen diesem Kaffee, den ich hatte, der war basically wie Raketentreibstoff.
Character 1: Ich hab, äh, ich hab meinen eigenen Kaffee von zu Hause mitgebracht, in 'ner Thermoskanne, wie so'n Bauarbeiter aus den 50ern.
192. [verwirrt] Moment, warum ist das peinlich? Das ist doch eigentlich voll clever—der Kaffee hier schmeckt, als hätte den jemand durch 'ne alte Socke gefiltert. Seine eigene Plörre mitbringen ist halt echt next-level Denken.
Character 1: [keucht leise] Du trinkst echt den Bürokaffee?
193. [gähnen] Oh Gott, jetzt muss ich auch gähnen! Aber ja, ich mein, wenn man um 15 Uhr verzweifelt genug ist, sieht selbst Sockenkaffee irgendwie verlockend aus. Aber deine Thermoskannen-Idee klau ich mir ab sofort definitiv.
Character 1: Ich hab auch mein Mittagessen in 'ner Star-Wars-Brotdose dabei. Weil ich anscheinend zwölf bin.
194. [kindlich] Ooh, welche denn? Bitte sag mir, dass es die vintage Empire Strikes Back ist, weil das wär absolut der Hammer und ich wär grad so neidisch.
Character 1: Es ist, ähm, es ist eigentlich Baby Yoda. Aus dem Target-Shop.
195. Okay, das ist ehrlich gesagt noch besser, weil's wenigstens aktuell ist? Ich benutz immer noch 'ne Sailor-Moon-Bentobox, die ich seit der Uni hab, also können wir die Brotdosen-Nerds zusammen sein.
Character 1: Du bist echt viel zu nett zu meiner kompletten Unfähigkeit, mich wie ein funktionierender Erwachsener zu benehmen.
196. Schau mal, funktionierende Erwachsene sind eh langweilig, und außerdem, du bist ja letztendlich durch die Tür gekommen, oder? Das ist doch schon mal die halbe Miete. Und jetzt weiß ich auch, wen ich anrufen kann, wenn mein Laptop endgültig den Geist aufgibt, also hat sich das hier eigentlich perfekt ergeben.
Character 1: [weinend] Ich weiß nicht mehr weiter. Meine Patientin, sie ist... sie ist vierzehn und schwanger und sie fleht mich an, nichts ihren Eltern zu sagen.
197. Oh Gott, das ist... das ist echt heftig. Okay, also erstmal—in welchem Bundesland bist du? Weil die Meldepflicht ist ja überall unterschiedlich und, ähm, je nachdem wo du praktizierst, hast du vielleicht gar keine Wahl.
Character 1: Bayern. Aber es geht nicht nur um die rechtliche Seite, ich meine, sie vertraut mir.
198. Klar, nee, das versteh ich total. Die Vertrauenssache ist, äh, riesig. Aber hier ist das Ding—in Bayern haben Minderjährige tatsächlich ziemlich weitreichende Rechte bei Schwangerschaftsangelegenheiten. Sie kann in Schwangerschaftsvorsorge und, ähm, entsprechende Behandlungen ohne Eltern einwilligen, was dir rechtlich gesehen etwas Spielraum gibt.
Character 1: Aber sie ist vierzehn. Sie ist ein Kind.
199. Absolut, und da wird's halt echt kompliziert, ne? Also, entwicklungsmäßig ist sie noch ein Kind, aber rechtlich und ethisch hat sie Autonomie über bestimmte medizinische Entscheidungen. Hast du, ähm, hast du mit ihr darüber gesprochen, warum sie nicht will, dass ihre Eltern es erfahren?
Character 1: Ihr Vater würde sie umbringen. Vielleicht wortwörtlich.
200. Okay, wow, das ändert die Lage erheblich. Wenn's Anzeichen für potenzielle Gewalt oder Missbrauch gibt, dann reden wir über einen ganz anderen ethischen Rahmen. Du könntest tatsächlich die Pflicht haben, sie vor Schaden zu schützen, was bedeuten könnte, äh, das Jugendamt einzuschalten statt direkt die Eltern.
Character 1: Ich bin doch... ich bin Arzt geworden um Menschen zu helfen, nicht um solche unmöglichen Entscheidungen zu treffen.
201. Mmh, ja, darauf bereiten sie einen im Studium echt nicht vor, oder? Hör mal, was du fühlst ist völlig normal—diese Situationen sind wirklich quälend, weil's keine perfekte Antwort gibt, nur halt verschiedene Grade von Schadensbegrenzung.
Character 1: Was würdest du machen? Wenn's deine Patientin wäre?
202. Ehrlich? Ich würd wahrscheinlich erstmal ein richtig offenes Gespräch mit ihr führen über alle ihre Optionen. Nicht nur wegen der Schwangerschaft, sondern auch, ähm, Sicherheitsplanung, wenn sie wirklich Angst vor ihrem Vater hat. Alles penibel dokumentieren, klar, und vielleicht eine Sozialarbeiterin dazuholen, die auf Jugendliche spezialisiert ist.
Character 1: Sie sagt, sie will das Baby behalten.
203. Uff, okay, das ist... das macht's noch komplizierter. Weil jetzt reden wir über Vorsorge, mögliche Komplikationen, Geburtsplanung—alles Sachen, die man echt schwer langfristig vor den Eltern verstecken kann. Hat sie die praktischen Konsequenzen durchdacht?
Character 1: Sie glaubt, sie kann's verheimlichen. Weite Klamotten tragen, sagen sie nimmt zu.
204. Klar, also sie checkt noch nicht wirklich die volle Tragweite, was ja, ich meine, bei dem Alter auch Sinn macht. Du könntest vorsichtig mit ihr durchgehen, was Schwangerschaft tatsächlich bedeutet—die Termine, die körperlichen Veränderungen, die Tatsache, dass es, äh, irgendwann echt unmöglich wird zu verstecken.
Character 1: Jede Option fühlt sich falsch an. Ihr Vertrauen zu brechen fühlt sich falsch an. Eine Vierzehnjährige das allein durchmachen zu lassen fühlt sich falsch an.
205. [verwirrt] Moment, hat überhaupt jemand geklärt, wer der Vater ist? Weil wenn wir von einem Erwachsenen reden, ist das sexueller Missbrauch und du müsstest das melden, egal was sie will.
Character 1: [streng] Es ist ihr fünfzehnjähriger Freund. Hab ich schon überprüft. Glaub mir, das hab ich als erstes gecheckt.
206. [husten] Sorry, trockener Hals. Also, pass auf—du kannst ihre Autonomie respektieren und sie trotzdem in Richtung Sicherheit lenken. Vielleicht schlägst du vor, einen vertrauenswürdigen Erwachsenen einzuweihen, eine Tante oder 'ne Schulberaterin, jemand der sie unterstützen kann ohne die direkte Gefahr von Gewalt. Ist nicht perfekt, aber es ist, ähm, es ist immerhin was.
Character 1: Ich glaube, ich hab gerade so eine Art spirituelles Erwachen. Everything feels different suddenly.
207. [pause] Hä, okay, das ist... das ist schon ne ziemlich krasse Aussage. Was meinst du denn genau mit anders—reden wir hier von Auren sehen oder einfach nur, ähm, dich mehr verbunden fühlen mit Dingen?
Character 1: Ich hab gestern gekündigt. Bin einfach rausgegangen. 15 Jahre in der Firma, vorbei.
208. [sehr melancholisch] Oh Mann, 15 Jahre? Jesus, das ist... Hör mal, spirituelle Sachen mal beiseite, bist du sicher, dass du nicht einfach irgendwie einen Zusammenbruch hast? Because that's a massive life decision to make, äh, auf so ein Gefühl hin.
Character 1: [seufzen] Du verstehst das nicht. Ich hab alles durchschaut. Die ganze Sinnlosigkeit davon.
209. Nein nein nein, warte mal—ich versteh ne Menge von Sinnlosigkeit, glaub mir. Aber hier ist das Ding, Erleuchtung zahlt nicht deine Hypothek, und, äh, deine Karriere wegzuschmeißen wegen irgendeiner Offenbarung seems pretty damn reckless to me.
Character 1: Seit wann bist du denn so materialistisch geworden? Du hast früher ständig über Bewusstsein und Sinn geredet.
210. Ja gut, das war bevor ich tatsächlich in der echten Welt leben musste! Schau, ich denk immer noch über sowas nach, klar, aber du kannst nicht einfach—you can't just blow up your entire life, weil du, keine Ahnung, zu hart meditiert hast oder so.
Character 1: Es war keine Meditation. Ich bin nur nach Hause gelaufen und plötzlich hab ich verstanden, dass nichts davon wichtig ist.
211. [husten] Sorry, Hals ist trocken. Uff, okay, also du hattest ne Existenzkrise auf dem Heimweg und hast beschlossen alles zu torpedieren? That's not spiritual transformation, das ist, ähm, das ist ehrlich gesagt ziemlich besorgniserregend.
Character 1: Warum bist du denn so feindselig deswegen?
212. Weil ich mir Sorgen um dich mache! So verarbeiten normale Menschen keine spirituellen Erfahrungen—die lassen nicht einfach, halt, ihr ganzes Leben über Nacht fallen. Usually there's, äh, some kind of integration period or something.
Character 1: Vielleicht bin ich ja keine normalen Menschen.
213. [verstummend] Klar, sicher, du bist besonders, du bist anders, du hast die Wahrheit gesehen die sonst keiner sehen kann... Verdammt, genau das hat mein Bruder gesagt bevor er dieser komischen Kommune beigetreten ist, and we didn't hear from him for two years.
Character 1: Dein Bruder hat seinen Weg gefunden. Vielleicht finde ich meinen.
214. Sein Weg hat dazu geführt, dass er sein ganzes Geld irgendeinem Guru gegeben hat, der sich rausgestellt hat als, als quasi ein Betrüger! So forgive me, wenn ich nicht gerade begeistert bin dabei zuzuschauen, wie noch jemand der mir wichtig ist in dieses, mmm, dieses gleiche Rabbit Hole reingeht.
Character 1: [monoton] Du denkst, ich hab ne psychische Krise. Sag's einfach.
215. Ehrlich? Ja, vielleicht denk ich das! Weil plötzliche Persönlichkeitsveränderungen und impulsive lebensverändernde Entscheidungen sind, ähm, they're literally textbook warning signs, und ich bin lieber das Arschloch das was sagt, als zuzuschauen wie du alles zerstörst.
Character 1: Was wenn alles zerstören der Punkt ist? Was wenn man so frei wird?
216. Ach komm schon, verdammt—Freiheit geht nicht um Zerstörung, it's about choice! Und gerade wählst du gar nichts, du reagierst nur, äh, auf irgendein Gefühl das du nicht mal richtig erklären kannst, which isn't enlightenment, das ist einfach nur Chaos.
# --- GENERAL_TAGS (continued) ---
Character 1: Der Teil, wo sie fragte, ob Depression steuerlich absetzbar sei, since you made a living from it—da dachte meine Crew, ich hätte eine Fehlfunktion. [chuckles mechanically]
217. [spontaneous excitement] Oh mein Gott, du hast das mit anderen Aliens angeschaut? What did they think about the grocery store meltdown story, wo ich über die Pasta-Auswahl geheult habe?
Character 1: Commander Zyx meinte, es sei unlogisch, 73 verschiedene Pasta-Formen anzubieten, aber ich habe die Metapher über Entscheidungslähmung im Spätkapitalismus verstanden. [seufzt]
218. [building energy] Das ist völlig verrückt—ich muss in 20 Minuten zum Veranstaltungsort, and instead I'm getting notes from an actual extraterrestrial, der in meinem Hinterhof abgestürzt ist!
Character 1: [verlegen] Falls es hilft, mein temporaler Stabilisator funktioniert noch, also könnte ich Sie technisch gesehen nach Ihrem Auftritt zu genau diesem Moment zurückbringen, though you'd remember both timelines, was möglicherweise zu psychologischer Fragmentierung führen könnte.
219. [laughing despite everything] Weißt du was? Having an existential crisis with an alien fühlt sich an diesem Punkt meiner Karriere eigentlich ziemlich passend an.
Character 1: [brightening] Wirklich?
220. [spontaneous decision] Scheiß drauf, steig in mein Uber—you're coming to Madison Square Garden, denn wenn ich heute Abend abstürze, habe ich wenigstens die Ausrede, dass ich vom ersten Kontakt total durch den Wind war.
Character 1: [genuinely touched] Sie wollen, dass ich Ihren Auftritt persönlich miterlebe? My studies suggest this is what humans call a 'profound gesture of friendship,' oder möglicherweise Stockholm-Syndrom.
221. [grinning] Versprich mir nur, wenn ich da oben total versage, you'll use that temporal whatever, damit ich es nochmal versuchen kann—und erwähn vielleicht nicht die Sonden-Witze, die ich definitiv machen werde. [pause] Abgemacht?
Character 1: [fassungslos] Mama hat mich gerade angerufen wegen irgendeiner „anonymen Spende" von Premium-Hörgeräten, die bei ihr vor der Tür standen, und ich hab das Versandetikett von deiner Praxis gesehen, als ich bei ihr im Müll... ähm, als ich da war.
222. Sie hat sie gebraucht.
Character 1: [bedächtig] Diese Geräte kosten 8000 Euro im Einzelhandel, und ich bearbeite genug Lieferantenverträge, um zu wissen, dass du nicht einfach so ein Budget für private Wohltätigkeit rumliegen hast.
223. [ruhig] Du hast doch gesehen, wie sie bei jedem Familienessen alle dreimal bitten muss, was zu wiederholen, wie sie so tut, als wär der Fernseher kaputt, wenn er auf volle Lautstärke gedreht ist, wie sie die Hälfte von dem verpasst, was ihre Enkel ihr erzählen.
Character 1: [frustriert] Darum geht's doch gar nicht—du kannst doch nicht einfach heimlich unserer Mutter medizinische Geräte andrehen, die sie partout nicht wahrhaben will, dass sie die braucht, und dabei Gott weiß was für kreative Buchführung in deiner Praxis betreiben.
224. [ruhig bestimmt] Doch, kann ich, und hab ich auch, weil es mich fertiggemacht hat zu sehen, wie sie sich jeden Monat mehr isoliert, und du warst zu beschäftigt mit deinen Gewinnmargen, um zu merken, dass sie seit zwei Jahren von den Lippen abliest. [seufzt]
Character 1: [defensiv] Mach das jetzt nicht zu 'nem Problem mit meinem Job—ich hab sechsmal angeboten, ihre Hörtests zu bezahlen, sie zu drei verschiedenen Spezialisten gefahren, aber sie stürmt jedes Mal raus, wenn jemand auch nur andeutet, sie könnte schwerhörig sein.
225. [scharfsinnig] Du hast angeboten zu zahlen, weil du so... so zeigst du halt Liebe, durch Transaktionen und Excel-Tabellen, aber Mama braucht jemanden, der das Problem einfach stillschweigend löst, ohne dass sie zugeben muss, dass sie alt wird.
Character 1: Also ist deine Lösung Betrug? Weil genau so sieht das für mich aus—Inventar manipulieren, wahrscheinlich private Ausgaben als gemeinnützige Spenden abschreiben, alles nur um ihre Verdrängung zu ermöglichen.
226. [beruhigender ton] Es ist kein Betrug, wenn ich sie selbst bezahle und über unser Spendenprogramm laufen lasse für die Anonymität—alles ist dokumentiert, legitim, nur halt so strukturiert, dass ihre Würde gewahrt bleibt, während sie sich an den Gedanken gewöhnt. [atmet aus]
Character 1: [sanfter] Du hast 8000 Euro aus eigener Tasche bezahlt? Mein Gott, das ist... das ist dein ganzer Notgroschen, den du seit der Scheidung aufbaust.
227. Sie hat 40 Jahre im Kirchenchor gesungen und aufgehört, weil sie die Töne nicht mehr treffen konnte, hat allen nur erzählt, sie wär müde—diese Stille ist hier der echte Notfall.
Character 1: [wehmütig] Ich wusste gar nicht vom Chor, sie hat mir nie erzählt, dass sie aufgehört hat, hat's einfach nicht mehr erwähnt in unseren Telefonaten.
228. Du verpasst halt vieles.
Character 1: [resigniert] Gut, aber was passiert, wenn sie rausfindet, dass die von dir sind? Sie wird sie aus Stolz zurückschicken, und dann sind wir wieder am Anfang, nur dass du 8000 Euro los bist.
229. [wissend] Sie weiß längst, dass sie von mir sind—hat die Seriennummern erkannt von den Demo-Geräten, die ich ihr letztes Jahr gezeigt hab, aber sie behält sie, weil sie jetzt so tun kann, als würd sie mir einen Gefallen tun und sie für mich „testen".
Character 1: Gott, das ist so typisch Mama, alle spielen mit bei der Scharade, obwohl jeder die Wahrheit kennt, aber sich alle einig sind, es nicht anzusprechen. [bitteres lachen]
230. Manchmal ist Liebe halt einfach mitspielen.
Character 1: [pause] Ich übernehm die Hälfte.
231. [sanft] Schon erledigt, aber du könntest sie öfter mal anrufen—sie vermisst deine Stimme, besonders jetzt, wo sie sie endlich wieder klar hören kann.
Character 1: Drei Stunden sitzen wir jetzt schon hier, du und ich, warten darauf, dass sie kommen und diese Ketten durchschneiden. Du hast noch nicht mal versucht, mich zu überreden, dass ich mich selbst losmache, kein einziges Mal. [seufzt]
232. [müde] Was bringt's denn? Du hast deine Entscheidung schon getroffen, genau wie ich meine vor 23 Jahren, als ich angefangen hab, diese Laster zu fahren. Wir stecken beide in unseren Mustern fest, bei dir halt wortwörtlich.
Character 1: [nachdenklich] 23 Jahre lang Sprit durch die Gegend karren, während der Planet brennt. Denkst du eigentlich mal drüber nach, was das bedeutet, all diese Liter, die sich in CO2 in der Atmosphäre verwandeln?
233. Jeden verdammten Tag, ehrlich gesagt. Meine Tochter studiert Umweltwissenschaften an der Uni, schickt mir ständig Artikel über Ozeanversauerung und Methanblasen. [atmet aus] Macht die Gespräche beim Abendessen echt... unangenehm.
Character 1: [sanfter] Deine Tochter studiert Umweltwissenschaften? Das muss ja... kompliziert sein für euch beide.
234. Sie sagt, sie versucht zu reparieren, was meine Generation kaputtgemacht hat. [pause] Kann ihr da echt nicht widersprechen, aber die Hypothek zahlt sich nicht von selbst und ihre Studiengebühren schon gar nicht.
Character 1: [abdriftend] Ich hab mal in der Versicherungsbranche gearbeitet, weißte, bevor das alles hier anfing. Hab Schadensmeldungen für Hochwasserschäden bearbeitet, hab zugesehen, wie die Zahlen jedes Jahr gestiegen sind, die Jahrhundertfluten alle fünf Jahre kamen.
235. [leise] Hat dich das zu... dem hier gemacht? Zuzusehen, wie all diese Familien alles verloren haben?
Character 1: Teilweise, ja. Aber hauptsächlich war's die Erkenntnis, dass ich mitschuldig war, wie ich da in meinem klimatisierten Büro saß, mit dem Auto zur Arbeit fuhr und so tat, als hätte das eine nichts mit dem anderen zu tun. [bitteres lachen]
236. Und dich an LKWs zu ketten, das soll die Dinge ändern? Die Welt dazu bringen, plötzlich keinen Sprit mehr zu brauchen?
Character 1: Nein, aber wenigstens tu ich nicht mehr so als ob. Wenigstens mache ich irgendwas, auch wenn's nur bedeutet, dass ein Fahrer drei Stunden zu spät kommt und ich wahrscheinlich vorbestraft sein werde.
237. [melancholisch] Meine Frau hat mich vor fünf Jahren verlassen. Meinte, sie könnte nicht mehr zusehen, wie ich jeden Tag nach Diesel stinkend heimkomme, wissend, was das bedeutet. [seufzt] Das Komische ist, ich hab ihr zugestimmt.
Character 1: [sanft] Aber du bist trotzdem weitergefahren.
238. Unterhalt, Alimente und 'n Kind, das die Uni verdient hat. Für was anderes bin ich denn qualifiziert, was so gut zahlt? Die Ketten, die uns fesseln, sind halt nicht immer aus Metall.
Character 1: [nachdenklich] Ich schätze, wir stecken beide in Systemen fest, aus denen wir nicht rauskommen. Du aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen, ich aus Gewissensgründen. Keiner von uns ist wirklich frei.
239. [entfernt] Manchmal rechne ich's im Kopf aus, wie viele Tonnen CO2 ich persönlich in die Atmosphäre gepumpt hab. Die Zahl ist so groß, dass sie sich nicht mehr real anfühlt. [pause] Wie Sterne zählen.
Character 1: Weißt du, was das wirklich Beschissene ist? Selbst nachdem sie mich losgeschnitten und verhaftet haben, fährst du weg und lieferst diese Ladung aus, und morgen gibt's wieder 'nen LKW, wieder 'nen Fahrer.
240. [resigniert] Und vielleicht wieder 'nen Aktivisten mit 'ner Kette. Immer im Kreis, während sich die Welt Grad für Grad aufheizt. [sanfter] Wenigstens findet meine Tochter vielleicht was Besseres raus.
Character 1: [wehmütig] Ich hoffe es wirklich. Ehrlich. Sag ihr... sag ihr, dass es einige von uns versucht haben, auch wenn wir nicht wussten, wie man's richtig macht. [ferne sirenen]
241. [leise] Da kommen sie.
Character 1: [hushed disbelief] Alex? What are you— I mean, the agency said they were sending their best motion designer, but I never imagined it would be you after all this time.
242. [quietly stunned] Yeah, well, surprise. When I saw your name on the work order, I almost passed it to someone else, but then I thought maybe this was the universe giving us a chance.
Character 1: A chance for what, exactly? To pretend the last five years didn't happen while you animate graphs about rising sea levels? [atmet aus] This presentation is for world leaders, Alex.
243. [bedächtig] I know what it's for, Sam. Believe it or not, I've been following your work since you joined the delegation. That speech you gave in Copenhagen last year was brilliant.
Character 1: [softening slightly] You watched that? I thought you'd deleted everything connected to me after Dad's funeral, after we said those terrible things to each other.
244. [wehmütig] Some connections you can't delete, no matter how hard you try. Look, we have three days to finish this presentation, and honestly, I've already started on some concepts that might surprise you.
Character 1: Three days. [seufzt] Right, okay, let's see what you've got then. But we're keeping this professional, agreed? No digging up old arguments about who abandoned who.
245. [sanft] Professional, sure. Though you should know, the central animation I created shows two systems working in opposition until they find synchronicity. Purely metaphorical for climate systems, of course.
Character 1: [catching the meaning] Of course. Just climate systems. Nothing else implied there at all. Show me this metaphorical masterpiece then. [leiser] And maybe we can grab coffee while we work.
246. [wärmer werdend] Coffee sounds great, and yes, I'm staying until we solve this. [kichert] That's the difference between a fourth visit and, well, getting it right.
Character 1: You always did have a way of making complex things look simple, even when everything underneath was completely chaotic and unresolved. [pause]
247. [vorsichtig] Speaking of unresolved.
Character 1: The presentation deadline is what matters now, but maybe after, we could talk about why you really took this job knowing I'd be here. [sanfter] There must be a reason.
248. There is.
Character 1: [almost whispered] I never stopped hoping we'd find our way back to being family again, you know? Even when the silence stretched on for years.
249. The silence was never complete, Sam. Every project I worked on, I'd imagine showing it to you, wondering if you'd be proud or if you'd have notes like you always did.
Character 1: [tender smile in voice] I always have notes. But this time, maybe we can work on the revisions together instead of letting them drive us apart.
250. Together sounds good. Really good, actually. [atmet aus] So, should we start with the Arctic ice data or the coral reef footage I've been working on?
Character 1: [brightening] The coral reef footage. You always did understand that beauty moves people more than statistics ever could. That's something I forgot until now. [meaningful pause]
251. Then let's make something beautiful enough to save the world. And maybe, [seufzt], repair a few other broken things along the way.
Character 1: [frozen] Rebecca? Was machst du denn hier? Ich meine, ich arbeite hier natürlich, aber du stehst in der Besucherschlange und ich hab dich nicht mehr gesehen, since the divorce was finalized.
252. [leise] Mein Bruder wurde vor 6 Monaten hierher verlegt, und ich hab endlich den Mut gefasst ihn zu besuchen, nach dem was mit seiner Verurteilung passiert ist.
Character 1: [sanfter] Tommy ist hier? Scheiße, ich hatte keine Ahnung, dass er in meiner Anstalt ist, sonst hätte ich nach ihm gesehen, sichergestellt dass er sich okay einlebt.
253. [bitteres lachen] Du hättest das für ihn gemacht, even after everything our family put you through während des Scheidungsverfahrens?
Character 1: [bestimmt] Dein Bruder war immer anständig zu mir, selbst als deine Eltern mich als den letzten Dreck bezeichnet haben, weil ich nicht gut genug war.
254. [voice cracking] Sie lagen falsch über dich, Mark, und ich hätte dich verteidigen sollen, instead of staying silent while they tore you apart.
Character 1: Das spielt jetzt keine Rolle mehr, oder? [atmet aus] Du hast dich für deine Familie entschieden statt für unsere Ehe, and honestly, I understand why you did it.
255. [verzweifelt] Aber es spielt eine Rolle, weil ich diese Entscheidung— ich hab sie jeden einzelnen Tag der letzten 18 Monate bereut, wondering what we could have been.
Character 1: Rebecca, bitte mach das nicht hier, nicht vor meinen Kollegen und definitiv nicht, wenn du gleich Tommy zum ersten Mal sehen wirst.
256. [zitternd] Ich weiß, das ist unprofessionell und dir gegenüber unfair, aber dich in dieser Uniform zu sehen, still wearing your wedding ring on a chain um deinen Hals—
Character 1: [sharply] Das ist nicht— [seufzt] Es ist der Ring meines Vaters, okay? Ich trag ihn seit er letzten Frühling gestorben ist, hat nichts mit uns zu tun.
257. [crushed] Oh. Natürlich ist es das. Es tut mir leid wegen deinem Vater, Mark, I know how close you two were trotz allem.
Character 1: [hollow] Ja, na ja.
258. Tommy weiß noch nichts von unserer Scheidung, weil ich nicht wusste, wie ich es ihm in Briefen erklären soll, die von Fremden gelesen werden.
Character 1: Du hast es ihm nicht gesagt? Herrgott, Rebecca, er wird es sowieso rausfinden, when other inmates mention seeing you with me today.
259. [pleading] Könntest du vielleicht heute nicht derjenige sein, der meinen Besuch abwickelt? Ich sag's ihm selbst, versprochen, nur nicht so.
Character 1: Ich bin der einzige Beamte im Besucherdienst für die nächsten 4 Stunden, also wenn du nicht nächste Woche wiederkommen willst— [verstummt]
260. [defeated] Nein, ich muss ihn heute sehen, because I'm moving to Portland tomorrow, für den Job, von dem ich dir vor 2 Jahren erzählt hab.
Character 1: [fassungslos] Die Stelle im Museum? Du hast sie tatsächlich angenommen nach all der Zeit, nachdem wir uns darüber gestritten haben, dass es jede Chance auf einen Neuanfang zerstören würde?
261. [kaum hörbar] Es gibt hier nichts mehr zu zerstören.
Character 1: [fassungslos] Moment mal, ist das—Melissa? Scheiße, ich glaub's ja nicht, dass du wirklich da hinter dem Schreibtisch sitzt, ich mein, das letzte Mal als ich dich gesehen hab, haben wir nach dieser Katastrophe von Show in Portland den Van beladen.
262. [leise] Danny. Ja, ähm, krass, ich hatte gehört, du bist immer noch mit Bands unterwegs, machst das Technik-Ding—Mann, das ist, äh, das ist schon komisch, oder? Du bist wegen dem Anderson-Konto hier?
Character 1: Das ist mein Vater, ja, ist vor 2 Monaten gestorben und ich versuch immer noch, diesen ganzen Krankenkassen-Kram zu sortieren, was ehrlich gesagt für mich wie Chinesisch ist. [atmet aus] Wie lang arbeitest du schon hier?
263. [wehmütig] Fast 7 Jahre mittlerweile, was sich total verrückt anhört, wenn ich's laut ausspreche, aber du weißt ja, wie's läuft—brauchte Krankenversicherung, geregelte Arbeitszeiten, diesen ganzen Erwachsenenkram, über den wir uns früher lustig gemacht haben.
Character 1: [leise] Ich hab immer noch die Telecaster, die du umgebaut hast, die mit den Messing-Sätteln, die du in Denver eingebaut hast, als wir nicht schlafen konnten und halt bis zum Sonnenaufgang an Equipment rumgeschraubt haben.
264. Oh Mann, daran erinner ich mich—wir hatten, was, 3 Stunden vor Load-in und sitzen da auf dem Hotelboden mit Lötkolben und, [lacht], diesem grauenhaften Tankstellen-Kaffee. Brummt der Bridge-Pickup immer noch so komisch?
Character 1: [wärmer werdend] Hab ich tatsächlich hingekriegt, war 'n Erdungsproblem mit der Abschirmung, aber ja, ich benutz sie immer noch auf jeder Tour—ist so'n bisschen mein Glücksbringer geworden, wenn du verstehst.
265. Das ist echt... das ist echt schön zu hören, Danny. [pause] Also, ähm, wegen dem Konto deines Vaters, ich seh schon, da ist einiges aufgelaufen, aber ich denk, wir kriegen 'nen Zahlungsplan hin, der dich nicht ruiniert.
Character 1: [dankbar] Das wär super, echt jetzt, weil Touren kommt ja nicht gerade mit Altersvorsorge, weißt du? Manchmal frag ich mich, ob ich nicht deinem Beispiel hätte folgen sollen, mir was... Stabileres suchen.
266. Stabil, klar, aber Gott, manchmal sitz ich morgens im Stau und denk ans Tourleben, sogar an die beschissenen Teile—auf Venue-Böden pennen, um 3 Uhr morgens Tankstellen-Burritos futtern, dieses Gefühl wenn beim Soundcheck alles perfekt läuft.
Character 1: [sanft] Du könntest doch immer noch spielen, ich mein, es gibt doch Wochenend-Gigs, lokale Sachen—verdammt, wir brauchen nächsten Monat 'ne Aushilfe am Bass, wenn du Bock hast, nur 3 Shows, nichts Verrücktes.
267. [zerrissen] Danny, ich hab bestimmt seit 2 Jahren keinen Bass mehr angefasst, und selbst da war's nur Rumgeklimper in meiner Wohnung, bis sich die Nachbarn beschwert haben. [seufzt] Meine Hornhaut ist komplett weg.
Character 1: Hornhaut kommt wieder, Muskelgedächtnis auch—weißt du noch, was du immer gesagt hast über Musik, dass sie wie Atmen ist, dass man zwar 'ne Weile die Luft anhalten kann, aber irgendwann muss man wieder einatmen?
268. [emotional] Scheiße, das hab ich echt gesagt, oder? So'n pseudointellektueller Mittzwanziger, aber vielleicht, ähm, vielleicht lag ich damit gar nicht so falsch.
Character 1: [ermutigend] Schau, ich bin sowieso jeden Dienstag hier, um dieses Abrechnungschaos zu klären, also was wär, wenn du nächste Woche deinen Bass mitbringst und wir halt nach deiner Schicht 'n bisschen auf'm Parkplatz jammen?
269. Das ist, hmm, das ist entweder die beste oder schlechteste Idee seit Jahren, aber ehrlich? Mein alter Precision steht noch im Schrank, braucht wahrscheinlich neue Saiten, aber er ist da und wartet.
Character 1: [hoffnungsvoll] Also ist das 'n Ja? Weil ich hab wortwörtlich jetzt gerade 'nen Übungsamp im Auto, und Dienstag ist nur 5 Tage weg—genug Zeit, um wieder Hornhaut aufzubauen.
270. Ja, okay. Ja. [lacht]
Character 1: [aufgeregt] Großartig, und hey, danke für die Hilfe mit Papas Rechnungen, echt—das bedeutet mir mehr als du denkst, 'nen Freund zu haben, der sich in diesem ganzen Bürokratie-Wahnsinn auskennt.
271. [warmherzig] Wir passen aufeinander auf, ne? Das haben wir auf Tour immer gesagt, und ich schätze, manche Dinge ändern sich nicht, auch wenn sich alles andere ändert. [pause] Also dann Dienstag, Musik auf'm Parkplatz wie zwei Teenager.
Character 1: [leise] Ich hab die Kerzen gesehen, als ich reinkam, und das gute Porzellan, und da wurde mir klar, dass du das geschmorte Lammrezept von deiner Mutter gemacht hast.
272. [bedächtig] Drei Stunden, so lange hab ich gebraucht, um alles hinzukriegen, inklusive der Fahrt zu diesem Spezialitätenladen in der Innenstadt für die Granatapfelmolasse, von der du letzten Monat geschwärmt hast.
Character 1: Der Berkshire-Deal ist in letzter Minute geplatzt, nach 6 Monaten Verhandlungen, und ich hätte anrufen sollen, aber ich saß draußen im Auto und musste das alles erstmal... verdauen.
273. [sanft] Das machst du immer, im Parkhaus sitzen bleiben, wenn was schiefläuft, als bräuchtest du diese Pufferzone zwischen Arbeit und Zuhause.
Character 1: Ich muss ständig an all die Abende denken, wo du allein Takeout gegessen hast, während ich in Due-Diligence-Unterlagen vergraben war, und mir dabei eingeredet hab, dass dieser Deal der sein würde, der alles ändert.
274. Das Essen kann man aufwärmen, und ehrlich gesagt, dich durch diese Tür kommen zu sehen ist mir wichtiger als jedes perfekt getimte Dinner. [leises ausatmen]
Character 1: [wärmer werdend] Du hast den Tisch mit diesen Serviettenringen gedeckt, die wir in Vermont in diesem Antiquitätenladen gekauft haben, von unserer Jubiläumsreise.
275. Ich wollte, dass sich heute Abend anfühlt wie damals am Anfang, als wir sonntags noch zusammen gekocht haben, bevor die Beförderungen und die Hundert-Stunden-Wochen kamen.
Character 1: Manchmal frag ich mich, ob ich diese Karriere über uns stelle, über das Leben, von dem wir geredet haben, mit echten Wochenenden und Abendessen zu normalen Zeiten.
276. [bestimmt] Wir stellen gar nichts über irgendwas anderes; wir finden halt einen Weg, beides hinzukriegen, auch wenn das kaltes Lamm um Mitternacht bedeutet. [kichert leise]
Character 1: Du hättest sauer sein können, hättest das Essen kalt werden lassen und ins Bett gehen können, aber stattdessen sitzt du hier in deinem guten Kleid und wartest. [stimme bricht leicht]
277. [zärtlich] Wütend sein kostet mehr Kraft als dich einfach durch das Chaos hindurch zu lieben, und außerdem wusste ich, dass du heute Abend jemanden brauchen würdest, der dich versteht.
Character 1: Die Partner wollen, dass ich nächsten Monat die Tokio-Übernahme leite, das heißt drei Wochen im Ausland, und ich hab noch nicht rausgekriegt, wie ich's dir sagen soll. [seufzt]
278. Du denkst, ich seh die Berlitz-Japanischbücher nicht, die in deiner Aktentasche versteckt sind, oder merk nicht, dass du Zeitzonen zwischen hier und Tokio recherchiert hast? [wissendes lächeln]
Character 1: [überraschtes lachen] Du weißt immer alles, bevor ich was sage, als wärst du drei Schritte voraus, während ich noch nach Worten suche.
279. Das kriegt man nach 10 Jahren zusammen—die Fähigkeit, jemandes Schweigen genauso klar zu lesen wie seine Worte, besonders wenn er mit guten Nachrichten kämpft, die sich kompliziert anfühlen.
Character 1: [dankbar] Die meisten wären schon längst gegangen, hätten sich jemanden mit normalen Arbeitszeiten gesucht, der ihnen die Aufmerksamkeit geben kann, die sie verdienen.
280. [flüssig] Die meisten sind halt nicht wir, und dieses unperfekte, fordernde, manchmal einsame Leben, das wir uns aufgebaut haben, ist trotzdem unseres, trotzdem jedes aufgewärmte Essen und jedes Mitternachtsgespräch wert.
Character 1: Ich liebe dich.
281. [leise] Ich liebe dich auch, und jetzt lass uns dieses Festmahl aufwärmen, weil das Rezept deiner Mutter was Besseres verdient hat, als kalt gegessen zu werden, selbst um diese Uhrzeit. [sanftes lachen]
Character 1: [cautiously] Du bist jetzt schon 3 Wochen hier, und irgendwas ist mir vertraut an der Art, wie du deine Kaffeetasse hältst, wie du mit den Fingern tippst, wenn du nachdenkst.
282. [nervös] Die Leute sagen, ich hätte so ein Gesicht, weißt du, the kind that reminds everyone of someone they used to know. [räuspert sich]
Character 1: Wie ist dein Nachname?
283. Es ist Martinez, aber der Nachname meines Vaters war was anderes, bevor meine Mutter wieder geheiratet hat, als ich klein war. [atmet aus] Hab ihn nie wirklich gekannt.
Character 1: [zitternde stimme] War es Richardson? Weil vor 30 Jahren ist mein Sohn David gegangen, and we haven't spoken since the day he walked out that front door.
284. [fassungslos] David Richardson ist mein biologischer Vater, aber er hat nie erwähnt, dass er Familie hat, nie was gesagt über Eltern oder ein Elternhaus oder so was.
Character 1: [overwhelmed] Du bist also mein Enkelkind, sitzt hier an meinem Küchentisch, schläfst in dem Zimmer, das mal seins war, und ich wusste nicht mal, dass es dich gibt.
285. Er hat mir mal gesagt, dass manche Brücken so vollständig abbrennen, dass nichts mehr übrig bleibt zum Wiederaufbauen. [brechende stimme] Ich schätze, er meinte dich.
Character 1: [tränenreich] Ich hab ihm 5 Jahre lang Briefe geschrieben, sie an jede Adresse geschickt, die ich finden konnte, but they all came back unopened or marked return to sender.
286. [leise] Er ist seit 3 Jahren trocken, lebt in Portland, arbeitet auf'm Bau, und manchmal hat er diesen Blick, als würde er was Schweres mit sich rumtragen, das er nicht ablegen kann.
Character 1: Weiß er, dass du hier bist, dass du mich irgendwie gefunden hast, or is this just the universe playing its strange games with us? [shaky exhale]
287. [hesitant] Ich hab dein Inserat auf dieser Couch-Surfing-App zufällig gefunden, hab den Namen erst nicht erkannt, aber dann sah ich das Foto vom Haus und erinnerte mich an ein altes Bild in seiner Schublade.
Character 1: [desperately hopeful] Du könntest ihn anrufen, ihm sagen, dass du in Sicherheit bist, ihm sagen, wo du bist, und vielleicht würde er wissen wollen, dass ich sein Zimmer noch so lasse, wie es war.
288. [conflicted] Ich weiß nicht, ob ich derjenige sein sollte, der diese Tür öffnet, to risk breaking whatever peace he's managed to find nach all den Jahren.
Character 1: Bitte. [voice cracking] Bitte versuch's.
289. [sanft] Er redet manchmal von dir, wenn er denkt, ich hör nicht zu, erwähnt, wie er jemandem das Angeln beigebracht hat an einem Ort namens Miller's Pond, ein Baumhaus gebaut hat, das den ganzen Sommer gedauert hat.
Character 1: Miller's Pond ist 20 Minuten von hier, immer noch da, immer noch voller Barsche und Sonnenbarsche, und das Baumhaus hat gehalten, bis die Eiche vor 5 Wintern im Sturm umgefallen ist.
290. [reaching for phone] Vielleicht ist es Zeit aufzuhören, die Vergangenheit entscheiden zu lassen, wie die Zukunft aussieht, to see if those burned bridges left enough foundation for something new.
Character 1: [breathing deeply] Was auch passiert, diese 3 Wochen haben mir schon mehr gegeben, als ich in 30 Jahren Stille und Fragen zu hoffen gewagt hab.
291. Er wird geschockt sein, wenn er meine Stimme von dieser Nummer hört, aus diesem Haus, aber vielleicht ist geschockt genau das, was wir alle brauchen. [dials slowly]
Character 1: [bedacht] Ich hab deinen Namen auf der Rednerliste für das Überlebenden-Panel gesehen und... na ja, ich war mir nicht sicher, ob du überhaupt noch mit mir reden willst, nach allem, was passiert ist.
292. [kontrollierte ruhe] Tja, hier sind wir also beide auf derselben Konferenz, beide halten Vorträge über Krebsbehandlung – wenn auch aus ziemlich unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln mittlerweile, nicht wahr?
Character 1: [leise abwehrend] Die Symptome, die du hattest, waren anfangs halt wirklich lehrbuchmäßig Angststörung – die Erschöpfung, der Gewichtsverlust, die Brustschmerzen – in 90 Prozent der Fälle mit dieser Konstellation deutet das auf Stress hin, nicht auf Lymphdrüsenkrebs Stadium drei.
293. Nur dass ich dir immer wieder von den Nachtschweiß-Attacken erzählt hab, von den geschwollenen Lymphknoten, die du dir nie richtig angeschaut hast, von der Familiengeschichte, die du als irrelevant abgetan hast. [scharfes ausatmen]
Character 1: Du musst verstehen, in einer Praxis mit 200 Patienten pro Woche, da folgt man eben diagnostischen Protokollen basierend auf Wahrscheinlichkeit und evidenzbasierter Medizin.
294. Protokolle, die mich fast umgebracht hätten, weil du dir keine zehn Minuten Zeit nehmen konntest, mich mal richtig zu untersuchen, statt mir einfach Antidepressiva zu verschreiben und mich nach Hause zu schicken.
Character 1: [angestrengt professionell] Ich hab deine Akte dutzende Male durchgegangen seitdem, hab nach dem gesucht, was ich hätte anders machen können, hab jede einzelne Entscheidung hinterfragt, die ich in diesen vier Monaten getroffen hab.
295. Vier Monate, in denen aus einer behandelbaren Stufe-eins-Diagnose ein aggressiver Stufe-drei-Krebs wurde, der experimentelle Therapien brauchte, [pause], Therapien, die meine Nieren dauerhaft zerstört haben.
Character 1: [kaum hörbar] Die Ärztekammer hat mich von Kunstfehlern freigesprochen, aber das heißt nicht, dass ich nicht jeden einzelnen Tag mit der Last lebe, was dir passiert ist.
296. [mit erzwungener fassung] Deine Schuldgefühle geben mir nicht das Jahr zurück, in dem ich dachte, ich würde sterben, oder die Kinder, die ich wegen der Chemo-Dosen niemals haben kann.
Character 1: [verzweifelt kontrolliert] Ich weiß, nichts was ich sage kann den Schaden ungeschehen machen, aber ich hab meine komplette Praxis umstrukturiert seitdem – verlange umfassende Untersuchungen für jeden Patienten, der mit deinen Symptomen kommt.
297. Also bin ich jetzt so'n Paradebeispiel, ja? Ein Lehrmoment, den du benutzt, um Assistenzärzten beizubringen, wie wichtig es ist, auf Patienten zu hören, die ihren eigenen Körper kennen? [bitteres lachen]
Character 1: [schmerzhaft aufrichtig] Du bist der Grund, warum ich mir jetzt bei jedem ängstlichen Patienten extra Zeit nehme, warum ich Tests anordne, auch wenn die Statistik sagt, sie sind unnötig, warum ich tatsächlich zuhöre.
298. [zitternd] Das ist... immerhin was, schätze ich.
Character 1: [vorsichtig] Dein Vortrag morgen über Patientenvertretung – ich hatte vor hinzugehen, wenn dich das nicht zu sehr... also, ich denke meine Kollegen müssen deine Perspektive hören.
299. Du willst da sitzen? [ungläubig]
Character 1: [stetig] Ich will in der ersten Reihe sitzen, wo du mich sehen kannst, wie ich jedes einzelne Wort anerkenne darüber, wie das Medizinsystem dich im Stich gelassen hat, wie ich dich im Stich gelassen hab. [pause]
300. [leise brechend] Gott, ich weiß nicht.
Character 1: [leise] Ich versteh's, wenn du lieber hättest, dass ich wegbleibe, aber vielleicht könnte es – dass ich da bin und mich dem stelle, was du durchgemacht hast – vielleicht könnte das Teil unserer beider Heilung sein.
301. [zerbrechliche entschlossenheit] Erste Reihe, Mitte dann. Und wag es bloß nicht wegzuschauen, wenn ich beschreibe, wie sich Sterben anfühlt, wenn dein Arzt dir nicht glaubt, dass du krank bist.
Character 1: Könnte ich vielleicht... also, könnte ich mal kurz Ihr Telefon benutzen? Meins ist... ich hab's draußen fallen lassen und es geht nicht mehr, und ich muss wirklich dringend meine Cousine erreichen.
302. [vorsichtig] Natürlich, das Telefon ist gleich hier hinter der Theke. Sie sehen aber völlig fertig aus—wann haben Sie denn das letzte Mal was gegessen oder getrunken?
Character 1: Ich hab grad kein Geld dabei, aber meine Cousine zahlt Ihnen das zurück, wenn sie hier ist, versprochen. Sie wohnt vielleicht 20 Minuten weg, in Riverside.
303. [sanft] Hey, vergessen Sie mal das Geld. Ich mach Ihnen was mit Proteinen und Vitaminen, geht aufs Haus. Diese Spuren an Ihren Handgelenken—sind Sie gerade in Sicherheit?
Character 1: [zitternde stimme] Ich kann nicht lange hierbleiben, die kontrollieren alle Läden in dieser Straße, so alle paar Stunden. Ich brauchte nur irgendwo mit Menschen, halt irgendwo öffentlich, verstehen Sie?
304. Hören Sie mir jetzt gut zu—meine Bürotür lässt sich von innen abschließen, und durch den Lagerraum gibt's einen Hinterausgang. [leiser] Ich schreibe gerade meiner Schwester, die arbeitet im Frauenhaus in der Oak Street.
Character 1: [panisches flüstern] Sie verstehen das nicht, das sind keine normalen Leute, die haben überall Verbindungen, sogar bei der Polizei. Wenn die rauskriegen, dass Sie mir geholfen haben—
305. Die kriegen das nicht raus.
Character 1: Da sind noch andere, mindestens noch 6 in dem Haus in der Elm Drive. [atmet zittrig aus] Die halten uns im Keller fest, bringen tagsüber Männer vorbei, während die Nachbarn arbeiten sind.
306. [bestimmt] Meine Schwester bringt jemanden mit, der sich genau mit sowas auskennt, jemand der weiß, wie man das ohne die örtliche Polizei regelt. Können Sie sich an die genaue Adresse in der Elm erinnern?
Character 1: [dringend] 1847, das gelbe Haus mit dem kaputten Briefkasten. Die haben uns vor 3 Wochen dahin verlegt, von einem anderen Ort, als jemand anfing, Fragen zu stellen.
307. Hab ich, schicke das gerade ab.
Character 1: Der Chef, Viktor, der fährt einen weißen Transporter mit einer Delle in der Beifahrertür, und der kommt so gegen 4 Uhr zurück, um die Schicht mit seinem Bruder zu wechseln.
308. [entschlossen] Das gibt uns 90 Minuten, um Sie irgendwo sicher unterzubringen und den anderen zu helfen. Meine Schwester sagt, die FBI-Einheit ist schon dabei sich zu mobilisieren—das ist nicht deren erste Aktion dieser Art.
Character 1: [tränenreich] Ich hab versucht, Maria mitzunehmen, als ich abgehauen bin, aber sie hatte zu viel Angst, meinte, die würden ihre Familie zu Hause umbringen, wenn sie abhaut.
309. Die Einheit weiß auch, wie man mit solchen Drohungen umgeht; die arbeiten mit internationalen Behörden zusammen, um die Familien zu schützen. [sanfter] Sie haben das Richtige getan, dass Sie rausgekommen sind und Hilfe geholt haben.
Character 1: [leise hoffnungsvoll] Glauben Sie wirklich, die kriegen alle da raus? Sogar Marias kleine Schwester—die ist erst 15 und die haben sie letzte Woche erst gebracht.
310. Die holen alle da raus.
Character 1: Ich hab mir alle Namen gemerkt, von den Mädchen und den Männern, die kommen, ich hab alles im Kopf behalten, falls ich mal die Chance kriege, es jemandem zu erzählen, der wirklich zuhört.
311. [stetig] Sie werden diese ganze Liste Leuten erzählen, die was dagegen tun können. Aber zuerst bringen wir Sie in mein Büro—ich hab gerade einen weißen Transporter am Schaufenster vorbeifahren sehen.
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS (continued) ---
Character 1: Ja, da hat alles angefangen schiefzulaufen. [bitter] Meine große Schwester ist zuerst hingegangen, meinte, das würd bei meiner Angst helfen, aber dann ist sie eines Tages einfach verschwunden und keiner wollte mir sagen, was passiert ist.
312. [langsam] Deine Schwester.
Character 1: [weinend] Emma, sie hieß Emma. [seufzt] Sie wär jetzt 22, wenn sie noch lebt, aber es sind vier Jahre her, seit sie jemand gesehen hat.
313. [beherrscht aber zittrig] Vier Jahre sind 'ne lange Zeit, Junge. Manchmal wollen Leute, die verschwinden, nicht gefunden werden, und manchmal versuchen sie, die zu schützen, die sie zurückgelassen haben.
Character 1: [frustriert] Genau das hat die Polizei auch gesagt! [laut] Aber Emma würde mich da nicht einfach zurücklassen, nicht bei allem, was da lief, außer ihr wär was richtig Schlimmes passiert.
314. [mühsam] Hör zu, es gibt Dinge über dieses Zentrum, über das, was da passiert ist, die du vielleicht nicht verstehst. [atmet aus] Manche von uns, die's rausgeschafft haben, mussten unmögliche Entscheidungen treffen.
Character 1: [keucht leise] Warte, du hast gesagt 'von uns, die's rausgeschafft haben.' [sehr leise] Du warst auch dort, oder? Im Riverside?
315. Vor langer Zeit, ja. Anderer Name damals, komplett anderes Leben, bevor ich zu dieser Version von mir wurde, die für'n Lebensunterhalt nach Antworten jagt.
Character 1: [hoffnungsvoll] Dann hast du Emma vielleicht gekannt! [aufgeregt] Sie hatte dieses Muttermal am Handgelenk, sah aus wie 'ne Mondsichel, und sie trug immer das silberne Armband von unserer Oma.
316. [sehr leise] Das Armband mit dem... winzigen Kompass-Anhänger. [lange pause] [zitternd] Ja, Junge, ich kannte Emma. [seufzt] Ich such seit drei Jahren nach ihrem kleinen Geschwister, hätt nie gedacht, dass du mich finden würdest.
Character 1: [leise] Ich hab den Balenciaga-Mantel von 1967 auf Instagram bei diesem Vintage-Händler gesehen, den mit den handbestickten Pfauenfedern. [pause] Der sollte eigentlich das Herzstück meiner Heritage-Kollektion werden.
317. [zögernd] Oh, der ist schon... äh... verkauft?
Character 1: [bitter] Tu nicht so, als wüsstest du das nicht, Marcus. [frustriert] Der Händler hat dich im Post markiert und sich für die 'exquisiten Nachlassstücke' bedankt. Du verscherbelst Omas Garderobe schon seit Monaten, stimmt's?
318. [defensiv] Hör mal, nicht jeder kann es sich leisten, Schränke voller alter Klamotten zu behalten, nur weil sie Erinnerungswert haben. [leise] Manche von uns haben echte Rechnungen zu zahlen, Studienkredite, die sich nicht einfach in Luft auflösen.
Character 1: Das sind nicht einfach alte Klamotten, das ist Modegeschichte, das ist unsere Familiengeschichte, und ich hab bei der Beerdigung extra allen gesagt, dass ich sie ordentlich archivieren will.
319. [entschuldigend] Du hast gesagt, du willst sie dir irgendwann mal anschauen. [seufzt] Sasha, das ist zwei Jahre her, und du warst in Mailand, Paris, überall nur nicht hier, um dich um den Nachlass zu kümmern.
Character 1: [wütend] Also hast du die Entscheidung einfach für mich getroffen? [zittrige stimme] Das Pierre Cardin Space-Age-Kleid, die Schiaparelli-Handschuhe mit den goldenen Fingernägeln, wie viel hast du dafür gekriegt?
320. [murmelnd] Genug, um meine Wohnung noch drei Monate zu halten. [defensiv] Und bevor du mich verurteilst, denk dran, dass nicht jeder Omas Treuhandfonds geerbt hat wie du.
Character 1: [wütend] Ich hab mir meine Karriere erarbeitet, ohne einen Cent von dem Geld anzurühren! [sehr laut] Jede Kollektion, jede Show, hab ich aus dem Nichts aufgebaut, während du hier gesessen und ihr Erbe wie ein Geier auseinandergenommen hast.
321. Ein Geier? Ich bin derjenige, der ihre Hand während der Chemo gehalten hat, während du in deinem Soho-Loft Kleider skizziert hast.
Character 1: [flüsternd] Das ist nicht fair.
322. [bitter] Weißt du, was nicht fair ist? Dass du jetzt hier reinschneist und behauptest, alles Bedeutsame sollte dir gehören, weil du der Künstler der Familie bist. [atmet aus] Für manche von uns mussten diese Sachen halt was anderes bedeuten – nämlich Überleben.
Character 1: [bedauernd] Wenn du Geld gebraucht hättest, warum hast du mich nicht einfach gefragt? [traurig] Wir sind Familie, Marcus, oder waren es zumindest, bevor du angefangen hast, Omas Sammlung wie einen Flohmarkt zu behandeln.
323. [sehr leise] Meinen erfolgreichen Cousin um Almosen bitten? [lacht bitter] Du hast echt keine Ahnung, wie demütigend das wäre, dir dabei zuzusehen, wie du einen Scheck ausstellst mit diesem mitleidigen Blick, den du dann kriegst.
Character 1: [mitfühlend] Es wäre kein Mitleid gewesen, sondern Liebe. [seufzt] Aber jetzt sind die Stücke bei irgendwelchen Sammlern verstreut, die nicht wissen, dass sie den Balenciaga zu ihrer eigenen Hochzeit getragen hat, oder dass das Dior-Kostüm das war, was sie für ihren ersten Tag bei der Vogue ausgesucht hat.
324. [zögernd] Es sind noch... äh... ein paar Sachen übrig.
Character 1: [neugierig] Was meinst du mit ein paar Sachen? [ängstlich] Ich dachte, du hättest alles ausgeräumt, als du das Haus verkauft hast – wovon du mir übrigens auch nichts gesagt hast.
325. [sehr kleinlaut] Ich hab die Sachen behalten, die sie auf den Fotos auf ihrer Kommode trägt. [leise] Das marineblaue Chanel-Kostüm, in dem sie dich als Baby hält, das Oscar de la Renta vom Hochzeitstag meiner Eltern, die sind in einem Lagerraum in Riverside.
Character 1: [warm] Du hast die behalten? [erleichtert] Obwohl du für das Chanel allein Tausende hättest kriegen können, hast du die behalten, die für unsere Familienmomente wichtig waren?
326. [sehr aufrichtig] Ich bin kein Monster, Sasha. [verstummend] Ich musste nur überleben, und ich dachte... ich dachte, du hättest uns vielleicht vergessen, das alles hier.
Character 1: [zögernd] Marcus, I didn't expect it to be you handling this—when the firm said they were sending someone, I just assumed it would be a stranger, not someone who knows exactly why I hadn't spoken to him in fifteen years.
327. [sehr leise] I tried to have someone else take the case when I saw the name, but we're the only firm in town that handles digital asset succession, and your father specifically requested us. [clearing throat] I understand if you want to work with someone else.
Character 1: [bitter] He would pick the one firm where you work, wouldn't he? [atmet aus] Even dead, he's still finding ways to make things complicated, forcing me to sit here and discuss his precious crypto wallets and cloud storage accounts.
328. [entschuldigend] The digital assets are actually substantial—we're talking about several million in various cryptocurrencies, NFT collections, and proprietary software licenses stored across multiple platforms. [pause] He was very specific about the security protocols.
Character 1: [frustriert] Of course he was meticulous about protecting his digital fortune while being completely absent from protecting his actual family. [leise] You remember what he was like, Marcus—you were there for some of it.
329. [mitfühlend] I remember the night you showed up at our dorm room with that bruise on your jaw, yeah. [sehr aufrichtig] But legally, I need to execute his wishes as written, regardless of our history or what I personally think about him.
Character 1: [zittrige stimme] The irony is that I'm probably the only one in the family who actually understands the technical complexity of what he built—all those distributed systems, the multi-signature wallets, the encrypted backups across different cloud providers.
330. [sanft] That's why he specified you as the primary beneficiary for the digital holdings. [seufzt] He wrote in the codicil that you were the only one who'd appreciate what he'd created, even if you'd never appreciate him.
Character 1: [aufgebracht] Don't quote his words to me like they mean something profound when we both know he only cared about his legacy being preserved, not about making amends or acknowledging what he did.
331. The authentication keys are split across seven different cold storage devices, and the recovery phrases are distributed using Shamir's Secret Sharing—you'll need at least four of the six trustees to reconstruct them. [pause]
Character 1: Typical paranoid bastard.
332. [vorsichtig] There's something else—he left a series of encrypted messages on the blockchain, timestamped over the last five years, all addressed to you. [sehr leise] I haven't decrypted them, but the keys are part of the estate.
Character 1: [wütend] Messages he could have sent while he was alive instead of hiding them in smart contracts like some coward who couldn't pick up a phone or write an actual letter. [atmet aus]
333. [deferential] You don't have to read them, obviously—you could just take the assets and leave the messages encrypted forever if that's what you want to do with them.
Character 1: [bedauernd] The thing is, I know exactly how his mind worked with systems like this—he would have built in a dead man's switch, something that triggers if the messages aren't accessed within a certain timeframe. [seufzt]
334. [surprised] You're right—there's a smart contract that will donate everything to charity if the primary beneficiary doesn't claim the assets within ninety days. [leise] He really did know you'd understand his logic patterns. [pause]
Character 1: Even in death, he's still trying to control me, force my hand, make me engage with him on his terms using the technology we both speak. [bitteres lachen]
335. [warmherzig] Look, we can do this at whatever pace you need—I'll handle all the technical execution, you just tell me what you want to access and when you're ready to deal with it.
Character 1: [erschöpft] Fine, let's start with the wallet addresses and work our way through the authentication process, but I'm not touching those messages yet—I need time to decide if I even want to know what he had to say.
336. [sehr aufrichtig] That's completely fair, and for what it's worth, I'm sorry you have to go through this. [sanft] I know it doesn't change anything, but he did seem different in those last few years, more aware of what he'd lost. [verstummend]
Character 1: [zögernd] Ich weiß, es sind schon drei Jahre her seit deinem Abschluss, aber ich, ähm, ich brauche dringend deine Hilfe. [pause] Morgen tagt die Kommission und ohne Visualisierung werden die niemals die Quantenverschränkungsmuster verstehen, die ich vorschlage.
337. [warmherzig] Professor Chen, natürlich erinnere ich mich an Sie—Sie haben mir ja das Empfehlungsschreiben für Pixar geschrieben. [besorgt] Aber Quantenphysik-Visualisierung in einer Nacht? Das ist, äh, das ist echt viel verlangt, selbst für jemanden, der sich auf wissenschaftliche Animation spezialisiert hat.
Character 1: [sehr leise] Sie nennen meine Arbeit Pseudowissenschaft, Sarah. 20 Jahre Forschung und sie sind bereit, mir sämtliche Fördergelder zu streichen, weil die Mathematik zu abstrakt für sie ist, um sie ohne Visualisierung zu begreifen.
338. [mitfühlend] Oh Gott, ich hatte keine Ahnung, dass es so schlimm geworden ist. [seufzt] Also, ich hab zwar den Artikel in Physics Today gesehen, aber ich dachte, das wär halt nur akademisches Gezänk, weißt du?
Character 1: [bitter] Akademisches Gezänk ist es ja auch, aber das macht es nicht weniger verheerend. Ich hab vielleicht sechs Stunden von deiner Zeit, bevor du schlafen musst, und ich bitte dich, das Unsichtbare sichtbar zu machen.
339. Okay, erklär mir mal, womit wir es hier zu tun haben. [nachdenklich] Ich hab meine alten Quantenmechanik-Notizen noch irgendwo, und ehrlich gesagt, komplexe Systeme in visuelle Metaphern zu übersetzen ist ja genau das, was ich jetzt für Game-Engines mache.
Character 1: [ängstlich] Es geht um Teilchenverhalten auf der Planck-Skala.
340. [atmet aus] Mein Gott, Professor Chen. Die Planck-Skala? Wir reden hier von Abständen, die so klein sind, dass, also, Pixel nicht mal als Maßeinheit Sinn ergeben würden. Wie soll ich denn etwas animieren, was jenseits visueller Vorstellungskraft existiert?
Character 1: [verzweifelt] Genauso wie du damals molekulare Bindungen für meine Chemie 301-Studenten animiert hast—mit Metaphern und Farben und Bewegung, die das Wesen einfangen, auch wenn's nicht buchstäblich akkurat ist. [pause] Du warst da immer brillant drin.
341. [leise] Glaubst du wirklich, dass das deine Forschung retten wird? Ich meine, diese Kommissionsmitglieder, die sind ja nicht gerade dafür bekannt, ihre Meinung zu ändern, wenn sie einmal entschieden haben, dass jemandes Arbeit zu abgefahren ist.
Character 1: [bestimmt] Wenn ich ihnen zeigen kann, wie sich Quantenschaum in meinem Modell verhält im Vergleich zum Standardmodell, wie die Muster natürlich aus der Mathematik entstehen, anstatt erzwungen zu werden... [verstummt] Vielleicht funktioniert's nicht, aber nichts zu tun funktioniert definitiv nicht.
342. [warmherzig] Alles klar, ja, lass uns das machen. Aber du bezahlst den Kaffee und, ähm, wahrscheinlich auch die Energy-Drinks, weil das wird eine sehr lange Nacht mit Rendern.
Character 1: [erleichtert] Ich kauf dir ein ganzes Café, wenn das funktioniert. [kichert schwach] Weißt du noch, wie du immer gesagt hast, Physik wäre nur der Quellcode der Realität? Na ja, heute Nacht debuggen wir gemeinsam die Realität.
343. [lachend] Gott, ich war so ein nerdiger Student. Okay, also, erstmal—hast du deine Gleichungen in einem Format, das ich verstehen kann, oder fangen wir bei deinen handschriftlichen Notizen an, die aussehen wie Alien-Hieroglyphen?
Character 1: [verlegen] Beides, tatsächlich. Die sauberen Gleichungen sind auf meinem Laptop, aber die echten Erkenntnisse stehen in meinen Notizbüchern, mit all den Rändern voller dem, was du immer meinen 'schönen Wahnsinn' genannt hast.
344. [spielerisch] Schöner Wahnsinn, der mir eine 1,0 in Quantenmechanik beschert hat, wenn ich mich recht erinnere. [pause] Also gut, lass uns im Motion-Capture-Studio einrichten—bessere Monitore und die Renderfarm packt alles, was wir ihr vorwerfen.
Character 1: [dankbar] Sarah, ich weiß, das ist echt viel verlangt, besonders nachdem ich wegen dieser Konferenz nicht bei deiner Abschlussfeier war. Das verfolgt mich ehrlich gesagt immer noch.
345. [sanft] Hey, du hast mir diesen wunderschönen Brief geschickt über das Folgen der eigenen Leidenschaft, auch wenn sie weg von der reinen Wissenschaft führt. [kichert] Das hat mehr bedeutet als jede Zeremonie. Komm jetzt, lass uns deine Theorie retten.
Character 1: [entschlossen] Weißt du was? Egal was morgen passiert, wenigstens wird jemand gesehen haben, was ich sehe, wenn ich diese Gleichungen anschaue—das Universum, wie es in Maßstäben tanzt, die zu klein sind, um sie sich vorzustellen.
346. [selbstbewusst] Und bei Morgengrauen wird die Kommission es auch sehen. [warmherzig] Ich hab vom Besten gelernt, wie man das Unmögliche selbstverständlich erscheinen lässt, Professor. Lass uns ihnen zeigen, wie 20 Jahre schöner Wahnsinn wirklich aussehen.
Character 1: [zögernd] Also, ich hab gestern diese Riesentafel am Kudamm gesehen, die für dein neues Luxus-Tierhotel wirbt, und... äh... da gibt's was, worüber wir reden müssen, bevor ich Biscuit für die Woche bei dir lasse.
347. [aufgeregt] Ach krass, du hast sie schon gesehen? [lacht] Ich wollte dich eigentlich überraschen, wenn du von deiner Tour zurückkommst, dir zeigen, was deine Empfehlung für mein Geschäft bedeutet hat, wie alles förmlich explodiert ist, seit du Biscuit zu mir bringst.
Character 1: [sehr leise] Meine Empfehlung?
348. [lebhaft] Die Fotos, die ich letzten Monat gemacht hab, als du Biscuit abgeholt hast, sind komplett viral gegangen, alle rufen ständig an und fragen, ob der echte Promi seinen Hund wirklich bei mir lässt. [pause] Ich hab allein diese Woche 40 neue Kunden gebucht.
Character 1: [zittrige stimme] Hör mal, es gibt da was, das ich dir schon vor Monaten hätte sagen sollen, als wir uns kennengelernt haben, aber ich hab's immer wieder aufgeschoben, weil du so gut mit Biscuit umgehst und [seufzt] jemand Vertrauenswürdiges in dieser Stadt zu finden ist halt echt unmöglich.
349. [verwirrt] Wovon redest du denn? [warmherzig] Du weißt doch, dass du mir alles erzählen kannst, wir haben Biscuits OP zusammen durchgestanden, seine Angststörungen, all diese nächtlichen Notrufe, wenn er wieder Schatten angebellt hat.
Character 1: [sehr leise] Ich bin nicht der, für den du mich hältst, nicht wirklich. [atmet aus] Ich meine, ich seh genauso aus wie er, das ist ja auch mein Job, aber ich bin nur ein professioneller Doppelgänger, der für Firmenfeiern und Geburtstage gebucht wird.
350. [stotternd] Moment, du bist nicht— aber das Auto, die Designerklamotten, wie dich alle im Café anstarren, wenn du reinkommst, und [verstummend] oh Scheiße, die Werbetafel...
Character 1: [entschuldigend] Das Auto ist geleast und ich kann's mir kaum leisten, die Klamotten sind aus Second-Hand-Boutiquen in Charlottenburg, und die Leute starren, weil sie versuchen rauszufinden, ob ich echt bin oder nicht. [leise] Ich wollte nie, dass das so kompliziert wird.
351. [bitter] Also jedes Mal, wenn du Biscuit vorbeigebracht hast, jedes Gespräch über deine angeblichen Welttourneen und Filmsets, das war alles was, Method Acting? [brechende stimme] Ich hab allen erzählt, mein Kumpel wäre dieser Megastar.
Character 1: Ich hab nie wirklich über Tourneen oder Filme gelogen, ich hab gesagt, ich hätte Auftritte und würde beruflich reisen, was ja stimmt. [seufzt] Du hast's halt angenommen, und ich hab dich nicht korrigiert, weil... ehrlich gesagt, es war schön, dass mich mal jemand behandelt, als wäre ich wichtig.
352. [sehr leise] Meine ganze Geschäftserweiterung basiert dann auf einer Lüge. [pause] Die Investoren, der neue Laden, für den ich gerade den Mietvertrag unterschrieben hab, die denken alle, ich wäre der Tiersitter der Stars.
Character 1: [mitfühlend] Du bist aber ein unglaublicher Tiersitter, das ist keine Lüge. [warmherzig] Wie du Biscuit durch sein Trauma geholfen hast, wie du seine Futtermittelallergie erkannt hast, bevor's irgendein Tierarzt gemerkt hat, das ist echtes Können, das hat nichts damit zu tun, wer ich bin.
353. [zögernd] Aber wenn die Leute rausfinden, wenn jemand merkt, dass du nicht wirklich er bist und das rumgeht, verlier ich alles, was ich aufgebaut hab. [atmet aus] Mein Ruf ist im Arsch, ich bin dann der Tiersitter, der versucht hat, Promiverbindungen vorzutäuschen.
Character 1: [schnell] Es sei denn, wir gehen das clever an.
354. [neugierig] Was meinst du mit clever? [nervös] Willst du etwa, dass wir weiter so tun? Das ist Betrug, und ich kann mein Geschäft nicht auf was aufbauen, was mich rechtlich in Schwierigkeiten bringen könnte oder noch schlimmer, das Vertrauen zerstört, das ich bei anderen Kunden aufgebaut hab.
Character 1: [selbstbewusst] Nein, wir ändern die Story langsam, du betonst mehr deine echte Expertise statt Promiverbindungen, sagst vielleicht, dein Promi-Kunde legt Wert auf Privatsphäre. [pause] Ich kenn Leute aus der Doppelgänger-Szene, die haben echt berühmte Haustiere, ich könnte dich vorstellen.
355. Das würdest du für mich tun, nachdem ich dein Image quasi ausgenutzt hab ohne zu fragen? [leise] Obwohl ich von deinem Aussehen profitiert hab, dich als Marketing benutzt hab ohne deine Erlaubnis, wahrscheinlich gegen dutzende Gesetze verstoßen hab?
Character 1: [zärtlich] Du hast Biscuit eine zweite Chance auf Glück gegeben, als jeder andere Sitter gesagt hat, er wäre zu gestört, zu schwierig. [warmherzig] Das ist mehr wert als jede Promi-Empfehlung, und ehrlich gesagt, dir zuzusehen, wie du mit ihm arbeitest, hat mir gezeigt, dass Authentizität wichtiger ist als die Illusion.
356. [erleichtert] Okay, dann kriegen wir das zusammen hin. [seufzt] Aber versprich mir was – ab jetzt sind wir komplett ehrlich zueinander, kein Schauspiel mehr, keine Annahmen, nur zwei Typen, denen Biscuits Wohl wirklich am Herzen liegt.
Character 1: [formally] Director Morrison, thank you for meeting with me on short notice about the Zhonghua Industries proposal. [pause] The State Department believes this investment could revitalize the entire region's manufacturing sector, tausende von Arbeitsplätzen schaffen.
357. [bitter] Ambassador Morrison now, is it? [räuspert sich] Twenty-three years since you left for Georgetown, und jetzt kommst du zurück und vertrittst ausländische Interessen, die aufkaufen wollen, was von Papas altem Fabrikviertel noch übrig ist.
Character 1: This isn't personal, Stefan, es geht um das wirtschaftliche Überleben einer Stadt, die seit zwei Jahrzehnten Arbeitsplätze verliert, seit die Werke geschlossen wurden.
358. [bestimmt] Everything's personal here, alles ist persönlich hier.
Character 1: The Chinese consortium is offering 400 million in direct investment, hochmoderne Anlagen und garantierte Beschäftigung für mindestens 3000 Arbeiter über das nächste Jahrzehnt.
359. And what about the families who've owned those properties for generations, deren Großeltern diese Fabriken mit ihren bloßen Händen aufgebaut haben?
Character 1: [frustriert] Those factories have been shuttered for fifteen years, Stefan. [seufzt] Die Dächer stürzen ein, die Ausrüstung wurde als Schrott verkauft, und die Grundsteuern erdrücken, was von diesen Familien noch übrig ist.
360. You wouldn't know that if you'd bothered coming home even once, nicht einmal seit Mamas Beerdigung. [leiser] Aber jetzt bist du hier, wenn es einen Deal abzuschließen gibt.
Character 1: [zittrige stimme] That's not fair, das ist nicht fair.
361. [warmherzig] Isn't it though? [pause] Du hast deine Karriere gewählt, deine Botschaften und Verhandlungen an Orten, die wichtiger sind als diese sterbende Industriestadt, und ich respektiere das, wirklich.
Character 1: [bedauernd] I sent money every month to help with Dad's medical bills, hab dir geholfen, das Haus zu behalten, als die Bank nach der Werksschließung die Zwangsvollstreckung wollte.
362. [sehr aufrichtig] Money isn't presence, Michael. [atmet aus] Als Papa gegen Ende verwirrt wurde, immer wieder fragte, wo sein Sohn ist, musste ich lügen und sagen, du wärst im Ausland bei wichtigen Regierungsgeschäften festgehalten.
Character 1: I was negotiating a ceasefire in South Sudan that saved thousands of lives, aber du hast recht, ich hätte hier sein sollen.
363. [leise] The committee meets Thursday to vote on the foreign investment proposal. [räuspert sich] Ich hab ihnen schon gesagt, dass ich mich wegen des offensichtlichen Interessenkonflikts enthalten werde.
Character 1: Stefan, please, dieser Deal könnte alles retten, wofür Papa gearbeitet hat, nur halt in einer anderen Form, als er es sich vorgestellt hat.
364. [bestimmt] Dad would have hated seeing his factory floor supervised by people who don't speak English. [seufzt] Aber er hätte es noch mehr gehasst, sie leer zu sehen, also da hast du deine Antwort.
Character 1: [erleichtert] You'll support it then? [pause] Das State Department muss wissen, ob sie mit den formellen Verhandlungen fortfahren oder die Investition nach Ohios Vorschlag umleiten sollen.
365. [erschöpft] I'll abstain from the vote but won't oppose it publicly. [lange pause] Das ist das Beste, was du von mir bekommst, Ambassador, wenn man bedenkt, dass du mich im Grunde bittest, die Seele unserer Heimatstadt zu verkaufen.
Character 1: [sehr aufrichtig] It still has a soul to sell, Stefan, was mehr ist, als die meisten Rust-Belt-Städte heutzutage von sich behaupten können.
366. [bitter] Welcome home, Michael. [räuspert sich] Versuch nicht wieder 20 Jahre zu warten für deinen nächsten Besuch, vorausgesetzt, es gibt dann noch eine Stadt zu besuchen.
Character 1: [sanft] Look, I know this isn't what you want to hear right now, aber Papa hat mich schwören lassen, dir das zu sagen, bevor es zu spät ist. [pause] Er will, dass du den Buchladen übernimmst, Michael.
367. [ängstlich] Wait, what? Der Buchladen? Ich hab seit, ach Gott, wahrscheinlich 5 Jahren nicht mal mehr daran gedacht. Warum sollte er—ich meine, er muss doch verstehen, dass ich hier in der Kanzlei Verantwortung habe?
Character 1: [traurig] He said you used to spend every afternoon there as a kid, hast die Poesie-Abteilung organisiert und, äh, den Kunden Bücher empfohlen. [seufzt] Er sagte, du hattest ein Talent dafür zu wissen, was die Leute lesen müssen.
368. That was before law school, bevor ich verstanden hab, wie die Welt wirklich funktioniert, weißt du? Ich kann nicht einfach alles aufgeben, was ich hier aufgebaut habe, wegen irgendeiner, ähm, nostalgischen Vorstellung, die er davon hat, wer ich mal war.
Character 1: [leise] He's dying, Michael. Die Ärzte sagen vielleicht noch 3 Wochen, und ehrlich gesagt, ich glaube, er hält nur durch, um zu hören, dass du es wenigstens in Betracht ziehst. [räuspert sich] Der Laden hat ihm alles bedeutet.
369. [defensiv] Of course it meant everything to him, aber das heißt doch nicht—hör mal, Stefan, hier verlassen sich Leute auf mich, okay? Ich hab Fälle, Mandanten die mir vertrauen, eine Partnerschaft, für die ich, was, 12 Jahre gearbeitet habe?
Character 1: [bestimmt] You hate it here. Du hasst es hier.
370. [schnell] That's not—ich meine, jeder Job hat halt seine Herausforderungen, oder? Niemand liebt seine Arbeit die ganze Zeit, und außerdem, die Partner respektieren, was ich hier einbringe, sie haben in meine Entwicklung investiert.
Character 1: Michael, you call me crying after every major case, erzählst mir, wie du dich fühlst, als würdest du Leute verteidigen, die, ähm, nicht verteidigt werden sollten. [pause] Wie du ohne diese Tabletten nicht mehr schlafen kannst.
371. [zittrige stimme] Those calls were, äh, private Momente der Schwäche, und ehrlich gesagt, dass du sie hier ansprichst, in meinem Büro, fühlt sich wie ein Verrat an. Jeder hat manchmal Zweifel, aber das heißt nicht, dass ich meine ganze Karriere wegwerfen sollte.
Character 1: [mitfühlend] I'm not trying to hurt you, ich will nur—Papa sieht es auch, okay? Er sagte, dich letztes Jahr vor Gericht zu sehen war, als würde er jemandem zusehen, der, äh, eine Rolle spielt, die er auswendig gelernt hat, aber nicht mehr daran glaubt.
372. He came to my trial? Er war da? Ich wusste nicht mal—warum hat er mir nicht gesagt, dass er da war? [atmet aus] Gott, das war der Morrison-Fall, wo wir die Chemiefirma wegen einer Formalie rausgeholt haben.
Character 1: [warmherzig] He was so proud that you won, aber er sagte, deine Augen sahen, ähm, leer aus, als sie das Urteil verkündet haben. Als hättest du was verloren statt gewonnen. Da hat er sich wegen dem Buchladen entschieden.
373. [frustriert] The bookstore barely breaks even, Stefan! Wie soll ich denn meine Hypothek bezahlen, mein Leben, vom Verkauf gebrauchter Taschenbücher? Die Partner würden denken, ich hab komplett den Verstand verloren, wenn ich das auch nur erwähnen würde.
Character 1: [leidenschaftlich] Who cares what they think? Ganz ehrlich, Michael, du bist 43 Jahre alt und hast immer noch Angst, Leute zu enttäuschen, die, ganz offen gesagt, nicht mal merken würden, wenn du morgen verschwinden würdest. [seufzt] Die würden einfach den nächsten Anzugträger einstellen, der dein Büro übernimmt.
374. That's incredibly reductive and you know it—ich hab hier Beziehungen aufgebaut, mir meinen Platz erarbeitet durch, keine Ahnung, tausende Stunden Arbeit. Wegzugehen wäre beruflicher Selbstmord, und wofür? Für ein scheiterndes Geschäft in einer sterbenden Branche?
Character 1: [sehr leise] It's not failing, it's waiting. Papa hat es all die Jahre am Laufen gehalten, weil er geglaubt hat, ähm, du würdest zurückkommen, wenn du bereit bist. [pause] Jedes Regal ist noch so organisiert, wie du es verlassen hast.
375. [zögernd] He kept my organizational system? Sogar die, äh, farbcodierten Genre-Etiketten, die ich in der Highschool gemacht hab? [clearing throat] Das ist—ich meine, das ist sentimental, aber es ändert nichts an den praktischen Realitäten dessen, was du von mir verlangst.
Character 1: [sincerely] I'm asking you to go see him, Michael. Sitz einfach noch einmal mit ihm im Laden, bevor es zu spät ist. Was auch immer du danach entscheidest, wenigstens hast du dann, weißt du, wirklich eine Entscheidung getroffen.
376. [murmelnd] I have the Peterson deposition on Thursday, und dann kommt die Partnerschaftsprüfung, also vielleicht, ähm, vielleicht nächstes Wochenende könnte ich—[verstummend] Gott, Stefan, ich weiß nicht, ob ich ihm gegenübertreten kann, wenn ich weiß, dass ich ihn wieder enttäuschen werde.
Character 1: [selbstbewusst] Sie dürften eigentlich gar nicht hier sein, dieser ganze Sektor wurde doch in den Untersuchungsberichten als unbewohnt eingestuft. [pause] Wir haben 300.000 Kolonisten im Kryoschlaf, die darauf warten, in ihrer neuen Heimat aufzuwachen.
377. [ruhig] Ich dokumentiere dieses Ökosystem seit 7 Jahren, lebe in einem Bioschutzraum etwa 2 Kilometer von hier. [seufzt] Die Untersuchungsteams haben sich nie die Mühe gemacht, nach einzelnen Menschen zu suchen, haben ja nur nach Städten und Infrastruktur Ausschau gehalten.
Character 1: [frustriert] 7 Jahre?
378. [leidenschaftlich] Dieser Planet hat die einzigen bekannten Organismen mit Dreifach-Helix-DNA in der ganzen Galaxie, Lebewesen, die Photosynthese mit drei verschiedenen Lichtwellenlängen gleichzeitig betreiben. [leise] Ihre Terraforming-Maschinen werden etwas zerstören, was wir vielleicht nie wieder irgendwo anders im Universum finden werden.
Character 1: [bestimmt] Hören Sie, ich verstehe ja, dass Sie an diesem Ort hängen, aber wir haben 12 Billionen Credits in diese Expedition investiert. [atmet aus] Der Vorstand wird sich nicht für Ihre Dreifach-Helix-Organismen interessieren, wenn da Familien sind, die alles verkauft haben, was sie besaßen, für ein Stück Land hier.
379. [verzweifelt] Geben Sie mir doch nur 6 Monate, um die wichtigsten Arten umzusiedeln, genetische Proben zu sichern, zu dokumentieren, was wir gleich verlieren werden. [zitternd] Diese Organismen könnten Medizin, Landwirtschaft, Energiegewinnung auf der Erde revolutionieren.
Character 1: [zögernd] Selbst wenn ich Ihnen helfen wollte, die Atmosphärenprozessoren starten ihren Zyklus in 72 Stunden. Wenn die erstmal laufen, ist der Kaskadeneffekt unumkehrbar und diese gesamte Biosphäre wird durch erdnormale Bedingungen ersetzt.
380. [bitter] Sie wollen mir also sagen, dass in 3 Tagen 2 Milliarden Jahre Evolution einfach ausgelöscht werden, weil irgendjemand Linien auf eine Sternenkarte gemalt hat? [lacht] Und das nennen sie dann Fortschritt.
Character 1: [abwehrend] Fortschritt ist, wenn 300.000 Menschen eine zweite Chance im Leben bekommen, statt in den überfüllten Slums von Mars-Kolonie 7 zu verrecken. [schneller werdend] Erzählen Sie mir nichts von Evolution, wenn das Überleben der Menschheit auf dem Spiel steht.
381. [sehr leise] Das Überleben der Menschheit.
Character 1: [ängstlich] Es gäbe da vielleicht... äh... noch einen anderen Weg, wenn Sie bereit wären, mit mir statt gegen mich zu arbeiten. [räuspert sich] Der nördliche Kontinent ist erst für Phase 3 vorgesehen, das ist noch fast 2 Jahre hin.
382. [neugierig] 2 Jahre reichen nicht, um ein komplettes planetares Ökosystem zu erhalten, aber es ist besser als 3 Tage. [pause] Was genau schlagen Sie vor, und was wollen Sie dafür?
Character 1: [schnell] Helfen Sie mir, die Gebiete mit der geringsten Biodiversität zu identifizieren, die Orte, wo wir am wenigsten Schaden anrichten würden, wenn wir dort anfangen. [seufzt] Im Gegenzug werde ich mich dafür einsetzen, dass 30 Prozent des nördlichen Kontinents dauerhaft als Forschungszone erhalten bleiben.
383. [skeptisch] 30 Prozent.
Character 1: [ernsthaft] Mehr kann ich nicht rausholen, ohne meinen Posten komplett zu verlieren, und Sie brauchen halt jemanden von innen, dem Ihre Arbeit tatsächlich am Herzen liegt. [leise] Meine Tochter wollte Biologin werden, bevor wir die Erde verlassen haben, bevor die Wasserkriege diesen Traum unmöglich gemacht haben.
384. [warmherzig] Wissen Sie, in all meinen Jahren hier habe ich Sonnenuntergänge durch drei verschiedene Sonnen gesehen, Stürme erlebt, die flüssige Kristalle regnen, Wanderungen von biolumineszierenden Fliegern beobachtet, die den ganzen Himmel in eine lebende Aurora verwandeln. [lange pause] Ihre Kolonisten könnten neben Wundern leben, anstatt sie auszulöschen.
Character 1: [bedauernd] Die Kolonisten wollen Weizenfelder und Apfelplantagen, keine Flüssigkristallstürme und außerirdische Wanderungen. [atmet aus] Sie wollen das Vertraute, das Sichere, die Welt, die sie verloren haben, als die Erde anfing zu sterben.
385. [sanft] Aber die Erde hat doch angefangen zu sterben, weil wir nie gelernt haben, mit der Natur zu leben, wir haben immer nur versucht, sie zu beherrschen. [seufzt] Hier ist Ihre Chance, es anders zu machen, endlich mal was wirklich Nachhaltiges aufzubauen.
Character 1: [langsam] Zeigen Sie mir Ihre Forschungsstation, lassen Sie mich diese Dreifach-Helix-Organismen sehen, für die Sie so brennen. [pause] Vielleicht kann ich einen besseren Weg finden, wenn ich verstehe, was wir da zerstören würden.
386. [hoffnungsvoll] Ich habe 6 Jahre Daten, tausende von Proben, Dokumentationen über symbiotische Beziehungen, die Sie umhauen werden. [schneller werdend] Und wenn Ihre Tochter immer noch diesen Traum hat, Biologin zu werden, könnte das hier das großartigste Labor sein, das sie je sehen wird.
Character 1: [leise] Marcus, ich hab heute Morgen die Kanülenabwurfbehälter hinterm Müllcontainer vom Gemeindezentrum gefunden. [pause] Die mit dem Klinikaufkleber, den du versucht hast wegzukratzen, dieselbe Klinik, wo du am Wochenende nebenher arbeitest.
387. [defensiv] Hör mal, ich kann dir das alles erklären, wenn du mir nur eine Minute— [seufzt] ach, eigentlich gibt's da keine gute Erklärung, oder?
Character 1: [frustriert] 20 Jahre kennen wir uns schon, und du kippst Sondermüll genau da hin, wo die Kids jeden Nachmittag Basketball spielen. [bestimmt] Hast du überhaupt 'ne Ahnung, was für ein Gesundheitsrisiko du für die ganze Nachbarschaft geschaffen hast?
388. [murmelnd] Die Entsorgungsgebühren haben die Hälfte von meinem Nebenverdienst aufgefressen. [verstummend]
Character 1: [mitfühlend] Ich versteh ja, dass das Geld knapp ist, glaub mir, aber hier geht's nicht darum, mal die Mülltrennung zu vergessen. [sehr leise] Wir reden hier von Krankheitserregern im Blut, benutzten Nadeln, kontaminierten Materialien, die wirklich jemanden umbringen könnten.
389. Meinst du, das weiß ich nicht? [zittrige stimme] Jedes Mal, wenn ich diese Säcke in mein Auto geladen hab, wurde mir schlecht dabei, aber die Arztrechnungen meiner Tochter hören halt nicht auf, nur weil ich ein schlechtes Gewissen hab.
Character 1: [warmherzig] Warum bist du nicht zu mir gekommen? [pause] Wir hätten was finden können, vielleicht mit der Klinik einen ordentlichen Entsorgungsvertrag aushandeln oder Fördermittel beantragen.
390. [bitter] Und was hätte ich dir sagen sollen? [lacht] Hey, mein perfekter Kumpel mit dem Beamtenjob, ich ersaufe in Schulden und überlege mir was Illegales zu machen?
Character 1: [sehr aufrichtig] Ja, genau das hättest du tun sollen, anstatt die Gesundheit von allen zu riskieren, auch deine eigene. [seufzt] Das Umweltamt muss davon erfahren, Marcus.
391. [ängstlich] Wenn die das rauskriegen, verlier ich meine Zulassung, meinen Job im Krankenhaus, alles wofür ich die letzten 15 Jahre gearbeitet hab, ist dann weg. [sehr leise] Bitte, es muss doch einen anderen Weg geben.
Character 1: [bedauernd] Ich hab schon alles dokumentiert und vor einer Stunde den Vorbericht eingereicht, weil das nun mal mein Job ist, aber ich hab dich noch nicht genannt. [pause] Wir haben 72 Stunden, um das ordentlich zu bereinigen.
392. [erleichtert] Du gibst mir 'ne Chance, das wieder hinzubiegen? [schnell] Ich kann heute Nacht noch ein professionelles Entsorgungsteam herholen, das irgendwie bezahlen, dafür sorgen, dass jedes kontaminierte Teil ordnungsgemäß entfernt wird.
Character 1: [streng] Es geht nicht nur ums Saubermachen, du musst jede einzelne Stelle melden, wo du in den letzten 6 Monaten was abgekippt hast. [bestimmt] Und die Klinik muss auf ihre Beteiligung hin untersucht werden.
393. Die Klinik wusste nichts davon. [zögernd] Ich hab den Müll mit nach Hause genommen und denen erzählt, ich würde alles ordnungsgemäß entsorgen, hab die Entsorgungsbelege gefälscht.
Character 1: [enttäuscht] Also hast du zur illegalen Müllentsorgung auch noch Urkundenfälschung begangen? [atmet aus] Marcus, das wird immer schlimmer, und mir gehen langsam die Möglichkeiten aus, dir zu helfen, ohne selbst meinen Job zu verlieren.
394. [entschuldigend] Ich weiß, ich hab dich in eine unmögliche Lage gebracht und es tut mir leid. [seufzt] Nach allem, was deine Familie für mich getan hat, als ich aufgewachsen bin, und so zahl ich's zurück.
Character 1: [traurig] Hilf mir einfach, das wieder hinzukriegen.
395. [entschlossen] Sag mir genau, was ich tun soll, und ich mach's. [pause] Ich verkauf mein Auto, wenn's sein muss, nehm noch 'nen Kredit auf, was auch immer nötig ist, um das wieder geradezubiegen.
Character 1: [erschöpft] Fang damit an, deine Unterlagen zusammenzustellen, jedes Datum, jeden Ort, ungefähre Mengen, die du abgekippt hast. [langsam] Dann rufen wir ein spezialisiertes Gefahrgut-Team, und du zahlst für Bodenproben an jeder Stelle.
396. [leise] Ich mach alles.
Character 1: [zögernd] I know you probably think I'm crazy for calling you up here at three in the morning, but this building contains thirty years of zoning maps and infrastructure plans that exist nowhere else.
397. [ruhig] The server room's still intact, I checked on my way up. [seufzt] We have maybe four hours before the demolition crew arrives, which means we need to prioritize what data to extract first.
Character 1: [ängstlich] The transit development models from the nineties are irreplaceable, they show every proposed subway extension that never got built. [leise] My predecessor spent his entire career documenting alternative futures for this city.
398. [bestimmt] I understand.
Character 1: [warmherzig] You always were good at cutting through the sentiment to find solutions. [pause] That's why I called you instead of the official IT department, they would have just told me it was impossible.
399. [nachdenklich] The building's power is surprisingly stable for a condemned structure, which means we can run a direct transfer instead of having to pull drives. [schnell] I brought portable arrays that can handle about eight terabytes each.
Character 1: [erleichtert] Eight terabytes might just be enough for the critical files. [atmet aus] God, I've been sick to my stomach thinking about all this history being crushed into rubble tomorrow morning.
400. [mitfühlend] These aren't just files to you, are they? [sanft] Every dataset represents someone's vision for what this city could have become, paths we chose not to take.
Character 1: [leise] My mentor used to say that city planning is really about preserving possibilities. [melancholisch] He worked in this building for forty years, documenting every single community proposal that came across his desk.
401. [leise] We'll save them.
Character 1: [dankbar] The water main studies from 2001 are in a proprietary format that nobody can read anymore. [frustriert] But there's a conversion tool somewhere in the system that might still work if we can find it.
402. [selbstbewusst] I can write a script to search for file type associations, should take about twenty minutes to scan the whole network. [kichert] This is actually the kind of archaeological data recovery I used to dream about in grad school.
Character 1: [neugierig] You studied digital archaeology? [surprised] I always assumed you came straight from computer science into enterprise architecture, never knew you had that humanities background.
403. [nostalgic] Before I got practical about making money, I wanted to preserve digital culture, save the early internet before it all disappeared. [seufzt] Now I mostly design cloud migrations for insurance companies.
Character 1: [sincerely] Well tonight you're doing exactly what you dreamed about. [hoffnungsvoll] We're literally saving a piece of the city's digital memory from being destroyed forever.
404. [entschlossen] Let's start.
Character 1: [nervös] The security guard downstairs thinks we're doing an environmental inspection, but he'll get suspicious if we're hauling out equipment. [schnell] We need to be subtle about removing the drives if the transfer fails.
405. [reassuring] The transfer will work, I've done this before with older systems. [ruhig] The real question is whether we can maintain data integrity while rushing through decades of nested folders and corrupted indexes.
Character 1: [wehmütig] Strange to think that tomorrow this whole building will be gone, replaced by luxury condos. [bitter] All these dreams and plans crushed to make room for another glass tower nobody asked for.
406. [accepting] Change is inevitable.
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT (continued) ---
Customer: [exhales slowly] Morgen ist meine Miete fällig und ich zähle auf diese Erstattung.
407. Bearbeite jetzt. Transaktions-ID RTN-5599-QM88 initiiert um 15:47 Uhr. Normalerweise dauert's 3-5 Werktage aber ich markiere das als Priorität.
Customer: Drei bis fünf Tage? [breath catches] Ich hab buchstäblich nur noch zwölf Euro auf dem Konto.
408. Warte warte warte. Lass mich—sorry, ich check noch was anderes. Ich kann das durch unseren Express-Kanal schieben, Code EXP-7734, sollte bis 23:59 Uhr heute Nacht auf Ihrem Konto sein.
Customer: [exhales] Sind Sie sicher? Weil ich kann meinem Vermieter nicht noch einen Scheck platzen lassen.
409. Absolut sicher. Referenznummer für die heutige Einzahlung ist DEP-8827-TK44, und ich überwache das persönlich. Sie kriegen eine SMS-Bestätigung an Ihre Nummer mit Endung 3928.
Customer: [long breath] Danke. Ich war so gestresst wegen der ganzen Situation.
410. Verstehe ich. Die Bestätigungs-SMS kommt von der Kurzwahl 77462 innerhalb der nächsten Stunde, und das Geld erscheint als "HÄNDLER-ERSTATTUNG ADJ-8827" auf Ihrem Kontoauszug.
Customer: Okay. [inhale] Okay, ich bin Ihnen echt dankbar, dass Sie das für mich regeln.
411. Aber natürlich. Behalten Sie die Referenznummer DEP-8827-TK44 für alle Fälle, aber Sie sollten—es ist alles erledigt bis Mitternacht. Kann ich Ihnen heute noch mit was anderem helfen?
Customer: Also ich brauch halt meine Rückerstattung. Von Order 4421. Die ihr storniert habt.
412. Lass mich das mal aufrufen... ähm, Order 4421-BC... okay ich seh hier, dass das am 14. storniert wurde, und normalerweise werden Rückerstattungen innerhalb von 3-5 Werktagen bearbeitet, aber bei dir zeigt's einen Hold Code RF-227.
Customer: Ein Hold Code. Natürlich gibt's einen Hold Code. Was heißt das denn genau?
413. Also äh, das System hat's markiert wegen der Zahlungsmethode—warte mal, lass mich noch was anderes checken... hmm, hast du eine virtuelle Kartennummer für diese Transaktion benutzt?
Customer: Ich brauch—ich brauch einfach das Geld zurück. Okay okay, ja, virtual card through Privacy.
414. Alles klar.
Customer: Also kannst du das freigeben oder nicht? Ich hab morgen Rechnungen zu zahlen.
415. Ich check grad unsere Processing Queue... äh, das Problem ist, dass virtuelle Karten manchmal automatisch Rückerstattungen ablehnen, was den Error Code VR-88-REJECT ausgelöst hat, aber was ich machen kann, ist ein manuelles Override durch die Buchhaltung einzuleiten.
Customer: Mal sehen... wie lange würde das dauern? So realistisch gesehen?
416. Also der Override Request, ähm, der geht innerhalb von 24 Stunden an unser Finance Team, dann müssen die den ursprünglichen Transaktionsbetrag von 847,62 Dollar verifizieren, und quasi sobald die das genehmigen—was sie machen werden—werden die Gelder sofort freigegeben.
Customer: 24 Stunden. Plus Verifizierung. Das ist das ist meine Miete.
417. Oh Mann, ich—es tut mir echt leid, ich weiß, das ist stressig. Moment mal, lass mich was anderes probieren... hmm, wenn ich das mit Priority Code P1-URGENT eskaliere, reduziert sich das auf etwa 4 Stunden.
Customer: 4 Stunden. Okay das heißt... vor 17 Uhr heute?
418. Sollte klappen, ja.
Customer: Hör zu, ich ich verlass mich hier auf dich. My landlord doesn't do late payments.
419. Ich versteh das vollkommen, und äh, ich mach gerade Notizen in deiner Akte... Case Number RES-9847-A... ich markier das als wohnungskritisch, which means our finance team has to action it first.
Customer: Wohnungskritisch. Das das gibt's wirklich? Okay gut.
420. Gibt's, ja, und äh, was ich auch noch mache, ist meine direkte Durchwahl 4412 zu deinem Account hinzuzufügen, so if there's any delay—which there shouldn't be—kannst du mich direkt anrufen und ich push das persönlich durch.
Customer: Durchwahl 4412. Genau. Und du bist du bist sicher mit den 4 Stunden?
421. Ich seh hier, mal schauen... eingereicht um 13:47 Uhr, also solltest du spätestens um 17:47 Uhr eine Bestätigung haben, though honestly these usually clear within 2-3 hours when marked priority. Die 847,62 Dollar werden erst als ausstehend angezeigt, dann als verfügbar.
Customer: I've been on hold for twenty minutes, nur um dann zu hören, dass ich technical support brauche statt billing.
422. I sincerely apologize for that inconvenience. Lassen Sie mich Ihre Kontodaten überprüfen, dann schauen wir mal, wie ich Ihnen am besten helfen kann, bevor wir die richtige Abteilung bestimmen.
Customer: My laptop warranty claim was denied, aber ich zahle immer noch monatlich die Gebühr für die erweiterte Garantie.
423. I see the issue now. Ihr Garantieantrag WRN-88234-LP wurde am 12. Oktober bearbeitet, aber die Rechnungsanpassung wurde nicht abgeschlossen. Ich erstelle jetzt ein Bridge-Ticket, um das zu beschleunigen.
Customer: This is the third time I've called, und zwar wegen genau diesem Problem.
424. I completely understand your frustration. Ich dokumentiere das in Priority-Ticket PRT-55412-A und stelle persönlich sicher, dass beide Abteilungen es erhalten. Unser Spezialistenteam wird sich um Ihren Fall kümmern.
Customer: How long will this take to resolve? Ich brauche einen konkreten Zeitrahmen.
425. The resolution team will contact you within four business hours, und zwar auf Ihrer registrierten Nummer, die auf 7749 endet. Die geben Ihnen dann einen kompletten Zeitplan und sofortige Schritte, um die Abbuchungen zu stoppen.
Customer: Will I receive confirmation, dass das diesmal auch wirklich richtig eskaliert wurde?
426. Absolutely, you'll receive an email confirmation within ten minutes. Das geht an Ihre hinterlegte E-Mail-Adresse mit Ticket PRT-55412-A und allen zugehörigen Referenznummern von Ihren vorherigen Kontakten.
Customer: I want a refund, und zwar für die drei Monate, die mir falsch berechnet wurden.
427. Certainly, I'm authorizing a provisional credit of $287.97. Der Bestätigungscode ist RFD-90023-XK, während wir das untersuchen. Das erscheint innerhalb von 24 Stunden als ausstehende Gutschrift auf Ihrem Konto.
Customer: What happens if the resolution team determines, dass die Garantie hätte anerkannt werden sollen?
428. If the warranty claim is approved, bekommen Sie die volle rückwirkende Deckung ab dem ursprünglichen Antragsdatum, plus eine zusätzliche Service-Gutschrift. Die Referenznummer SVC-44098-B dokumentiert diese Zusage in Ihrer Akte.
Customer: I need direct contact information, um beim Resolution Team nachfassen zu können.
429. Of course, the direct line is 1-800-555-4492, extension 7703. Fragen Sie nach Fallnummer PRT-55412-A, dann haben die Ihre komplette Akte bereit.
Customer: Can you guarantee, dass ich nicht wieder weitergeleitet werde, wenn ich diese Nummer anrufe?
430. Yes, I can guarantee that. Ich habe Ihren Fall mit Routing-Priorität RPX-7721 codiert, was sicherstellt, dass Sie direkt zum Spezialistenteam durchkommen, ohne automatisches Menü oder weitere Weiterleitungen.
Customer: Fine, send me everything we discussed in writing, und zwar noch heute vor Geschäftsschluss.
431. Certainly, I'll send a comprehensive summary. Das schicke ich mit allen Referenznummern, der Direktleitung und dem erwarteten Lösungszeitplan innerhalb der nächsten 30 Minuten an Ihre E-Mail.
Customer: Ich muss verstehen, warum meine Zahlung heute Morgen abgelehnt wurde. Ich bin seit drei Jahren Kunde, ohne je Probleme gehabt zu haben.
432. Ich verstehe Ihre Beunruhigung. Ich schau mir das sofort mal an. Darf ich Ihre Kontonummer haben oder die E-Mail-Adresse, die mit Ihrem Konto verknüpft ist?
Customer: Die E-Mail ist thompson.rachel@techcorp.com. Das beeinträchtigt gerade meinen Geschäftsbetrieb.
433. Danke schön. Ich hab Ihr Konto hier, Rachel Thompson, Kontonummer BUS-48291-TX. Ich sehe eine abgelehnte Transaktion von heute Morgen um 9:47 Uhr über 2.847,50 Euro.
Customer: Genau richtig. Meine Karte hat genügend Deckung und keine Einschränkungen.
434. Ah, ich seh das Problem. Ihre Karte mit der Endung 4782 ist am 31.10.2024 abgelaufen, das hat die automatische Ablehnung ausgelöst. Das System zeigt, dass wir drei Erneuerungshinweise geschickt haben, beginnend am 15. September.
Customer: Die hab ich nie bekommen. Also das ist ja wohl... bei einem Premium-Geschäftskonto geht das echt nicht.
435. Das tut mir wirklich leid. Lassen Sie mich mal Ihre Benachrichtigungseinstellungen prüfen. Ihre primäre E-Mail ist als thompson.r@personal.net eingetragen, nicht Ihre Geschäfts-E-Mail, und die letzte Änderung war am 22. März 2023.
Customer: Ach so, das erklärt's. Diese E-Mail ist schon seit Monaten deaktiviert. Warum wurde ich nicht über andere Kanäle benachrichtigt?
436. Verstehe. Laut Ihren Kontoeinstellungen war E-Mail Ihre einzige gewählte Benachrichtigungsmethode. Ich kann Ihre Kontaktdaten sofort aktualisieren und SMS-Benachrichtigungen an die Nummer mit der Endung 7745 als Backup hinzufügen.
Customer: Ja, ändern Sie beides sofort. Was ist mit der heutigen fehlgeschlagenen Transaktion? Die muss durchgehen.
437. Natürlich. Sobald Sie mir Ihre neuen Kartendaten geben, kann ich die Zahlung über 2.847,50 Euro sofort durchführen und die Gebühr von 35 Euro für die abgelehnte Zahlung kulanzhalber erlassen.
Customer: Ich hab die neue Karte parat. Wie verhindern wir, dass das nochmal passiert?
438. Perfekt. Nachdem ich Ihre Karte aktualisiert habe, aktiviere ich unseren Auto-Update-Service, der sich mit Ihrer Bank synchronisiert, wenn Karten neu ausgestellt werden. Ich stelle auch Kalendererinnerungen 60, 30 und 7 Tage vor jedem Ablaufdatum ein.
Customer: Das sollte funktionieren. Die neue Kartennummer beginnt mit 4921.
439. Ausgezeichnet. Bitte geben Sie mir die vollständige Kartennummer, das Ablaufdatum und den CVV-Code. Zur Sicherheit hab ich unsere verschlüsselte Leitung ENC-7829-SECURE für die nächsten 90 Sekunden aktiviert.
Customer: Ich hab die Daten eingegeben. Können Sie bestätigen, dass die Zahlung heute durchgeht?
440. Karte erfolgreich verifiziert und gespeichert. Ich führe jetzt die Zahlung über 2.847,50 Euro durch. Transaktions-ID TXN-892147-Q4 ist genehmigt, und Sie erhalten innerhalb von 5 Minuten eine Bestätigung an thompson.rachel@techcorp.com.
Customer: Gut. Ich möchte auch eine Dokumentation dieses Vorfalls für meine Unterlagen.
441. Selbstverständlich. Ich schicke Ihnen einen detaillierten Vorfallbericht REP-112024-8K3, der den Zeitverlauf, die Lösung und den Erlass der 35-Euro-Gebühr enthält. Kann ich Ihnen heute noch bei etwas anderem helfen?
Customer: Also ich... ich kann das jetzt echt nicht mehr, da ist so eine Abbuchung auf meiner Karte und ich war noch nie in diesem Laden?
442. Oh je, das tut mir echt leid, dass Sie das durchmachen müssen. Ähm, ich schau mir gleich mal Ihr Konto an—könnten Sie mir die letzten vier Ziffern Ihrer Karte geben, die auf, äh, moment, was ist eigentlich Ihre Kundennummer?
Customer: Die müsste hier irgendwo stehen, ich glaub M... M1847293, und die Abbuchung ist von einem Laden namens Luxe Boutique?
443. Okay okay, hmm, ich hab's hier—M1847293, perfekt—und ja, da ist eine Abbuchung über 487,32 Euro von Luxe Boutique vom 14. November. Das tut mir echt, äh, das tut mir echt leid, das muss ja total stressig sein.
Customer: Vierhundertsiebenund... ich kann einfach nicht, also das ist die Hälfte meiner Miete und ich weiß nicht mal, was das für ein Laden ist!
444. Ich verstehe total, warum Sie aufgebracht sind, und, äh, lassen Sie mich mal was nachschauen... der Transaktionscode ist TXN-9847-BK22, verarbeitet um 15:47 Uhr. Hmm, es wird als Einkauf vor Ort mit Chip-Verifizierung angezeigt.
Customer: Vor Ort? Aber ich war auf der Arbeit, also ich war definitiv auf der Arbeit, wie ist das denn überhaupt möglich?
445. Das ist, äh, das ist auf jeden Fall besorgniserregend. Ich markiere das sofort als möglichen Betrug—ich trage die Referenznummer FRD-2847-XM91 in Ihr Konto ein, und wir müssen, ähm, also erstmal das Wichtigste, können Sie nachschauen, ob Sie Ihre physische Karte bei sich haben?
Customer: Ja, sie ist nicht... warte. Oh mein Gott. Sie ist nicht da.
446. Oh nein, okay, also—ich meine, das tut mir echt leid—aber eigentlich hilft uns das, schnell zu handeln. Ich sperre sofort Ihre Karte mit der Endung 4782, und, äh, wir schicken Ihnen per Express eine neue raus, die sollte bis Montag da sein.
Customer: Natürlich passiert das jetzt, also wirklich kurz vor den Feiertagen, wo ich alles kaufen muss.
447. Ich weiß, das Timing ist einfach—uff, das kann ich echt nachvollziehen. Ähm, was ich aber machen kann, ist eine temporäre virtuelle Kartennummer zu erstellen, VCC-8827-TMP, die Sie für Online-Käufe nutzen können, während Sie warten?
Customer: Also bin ich halt bis Montag aufgeschmissen für alles vor Ort? Das ist ja... perfekt.
448. Na ja, eigentlich—hmm, lassen Sie mich mal was anderes für Sie checken... wenn Sie ein Smartphone mit kontaktlosem Bezahlen haben, kann ich, äh, ich kann die virtuelle Karte direkt in Ihre digitale Wallet pushen, Referenzcode PUSH-9901-DW.
Customer: Oh. Echt jetzt? Ich schätze, das ist, also das könnte irgendwie funktionieren?
449. Auf jeden Fall! Also ich schicke das durch—Sie bekommen in etwa dreißig Sekunden eine SMS an 917-555-0142 mit dem Aktivierungslink, und dann, äh, dann können Sie überall kontaktlos bezahlen.
Customer: Okay aber was ist denn mit der Betrugsabbuchung, weil ich brauch das Geld schon irgendwie zurück?
450. Richtig richtig, natürlich—also die vorläufige Gutschrift von 487,32 Euro wird innerhalb von 24 bis 48 Stunden auf Ihrem Konto sein, während wir das untersuchen, und, ähm, Sie müssen eine eidesstattliche Erklärung unterschreiben, die wir an Ihre hinterlegte E-Mail-Adresse schicken.
Customer: Vierundzwanzig bis achtundvierzig Stunden... klar, warum nicht, es geht ja sowieso alles den Bach runter.
451. Es tut mir wirklich, wirklich leid wegen all dem. Äh, nur damit Sie alles haben—Ihre Fallnummer ist FRD-2847-XM91, und falls Sie irgendwas brauchen, die Direktnummer unserer Betrugsabteilung ist 0800-555-FRAUD, rund um die Uhr erreichbar.
Customer: Ich hab vor drei Tagen eine Kaffeemaschine gekauft und jetzt ist die im Angebot für weniger, also...
452. Okay. Lass mich das mal aufrufen. Also ich brauch erstmal Ihre Bestellnummer. Dann kriegen wir das auf jeden Fall geregelt.
Customer: Die ist, ähm... warte mal. Bestellung 4829-XKL.
453. Perfekt. Bestellung 4829-XKL. Hab ich. Also die DeLuxe Pro, Sie haben 189,99 Euro bezahlt. Und Sie sehen die jetzt zu welchem Preis?
Customer: Einhundertneununddreißig. Falls Sie überhaupt noch Preisanpassungen machen...
454. Machen wir. Tatsächlich. Also was hier passiert ist. Das System zeigt mir eine Preissenkung auf 139,99 Euro seit gestern. Das sind fünfzig Euro Unterschied.
Customer: Genau. Muss ich die jetzt zurückschicken und neu kaufen oder...
455. Nein nein nein. Auf keinen Fall. Also was ich jetzt gerade mache. Ich bearbeite Anpassungscode ADJ-7742-MK. Die fünfzig Euro gehen direkt zurück auf Ihre Karte.
Customer: Echt? Das geht wirklich?
456. Läuft schon. Transaktions-ID TXN-9983-BV22 ist im System. Sollte in zwei bis drei Werktagen auf Ihrem Konto sein. Fertig.
Customer: Oh. Okay. Das war ja einfacher als ich dachte.
457. Hören Sie. Mal unter uns? Ich hab dieselbe Kaffeemaschine letzten Monat gekauft. Voller Preis bezahlt. Zweihundertzehn Euro. Also ich versteh Sie total.
Customer: Haben Sie Ihr Geld auch zurückbekommen?
458. Hab's versucht. Aber ich war außerhalb der Frist. Sieben Tage. Das ist die Regelung. Dokument POL-4.2 falls Sie's mal brauchen. Sie haben am dritten Tag angerufen. Perfektes Timing.
Customer: Ich hätte fast gar nicht angerufen, ehrlich gesagt.
459. Bin froh, dass Sie's gemacht haben. Fünfzig Euro sind halt fünfzig Euro. Die Bestätigungsmail mit Referenz RMA-8827-QP sollte in Ihrem Posteingang sein. Genau. Jetzt.
Customer: Ja, seh ich. Danke, dass Sie das so unkompliziert gemacht haben.
460. Das ist das Ziel. Kurze Frage noch. Die DeLuxe Pro. Sind Sie zufrieden? Ich mein—wirklich zufrieden? Meine spinnt in letzter Zeit rum.
Customer: Die ist gut, glaub ich? Macht jedenfalls ordentlichen Kaffee.
461. Gut zu wissen. Na ja. Gutschrift über 50,00 Euro ist bestätigt. Vorgangsnummer CS-4429-XLM für Ihre Unterlagen. Kann ich sonst noch was für Sie tun?
Customer: Ich muss dringend mit jemandem sprechen wegen Geldern, die seit zwei Wochen auf meinem Geschäftskonto festgehalten werden.
462. Vielen Dank, dass Sie uns heute kontaktieren. Ich kann mir vorstellen, wie beunruhigend das für Ihren Geschäftsbetrieb sein muss. Lassen Sie mich gleich mal Ihr Händlerkonto aufrufen. Darf ich Ihren Firmennamen und Ihre Händler-ID haben?
Customer: Das ist Riverside Boutique. Die Händler-ID müsste MID-847291-RS sein.
463. Danke schön. Ich hab Ihr Konto gefunden, Riverside Boutique mit der Händler-ID MID-847291-RS. Ich sehe hier, dass Gelder in Höhe von 18.750,00 Euro zurückgehalten werden, das wurde am 4. Januar veranlasst. Lassen Sie mich mal den genauen Grund für diese Sperrung prüfen.
Customer: Das ist doch komplett inakzeptabel. Das Geld brauche ich für die Gehaltsabrechnung und Wareneinkäufe.
464. Ich verstehe Ihre Frustration vollkommen, und es tut mir wirklich aufrichtig leid, welche Auswirkungen das auf Ihren Geschäftsbetrieb hat. Die Sperrung wurde von unserem Risikoprüfungssystem ausgelöst wegen einer... äh... 340-prozentigen Erhöhung des Transaktionsvolumens zwischen dem 28. Dezember und 3. Januar im Vergleich zu Ihren üblichen Verarbeitungsmustern.
Customer: Ja natürlich gab's da 'ne Erhöhung. Wir hatten doch unseren Jahresausverkauf und die Feiertage sind grade erst vorbei.
465. Das macht natürlich absolut Sinn, und ich seh' hier auch ganz klar, dass das... also das ist ja eindeutig legitime saisonale Geschäftstätigkeit. Unser automatisches System hat das als ungewöhnliche Aktivität markiert, aber wenn ich mir Ihre Kontohistorie der Vorjahre anschaue, kann ich ähnliche Muster im Januar 2024 und Januar 2023 bestätigen.
Customer: Und warum wurde das dann nicht berücksichtigt, bevor meine Gelder zwei volle Wochen lang festgehalten wurden?
466. Sie haben vollkommen recht, das zu hinterfragen. Das System hätte... also, es hätte Ihre saisonalen Muster erkennen müssen, basierend auf Ihrer dreijährigen Verarbeitungshistorie bei uns. Ich eskaliere das sofort an unseren Risikomanagement-Supervisor mit der Referenznummer ESC-2025-01-18-4492, um diese Gelder noch heute freizugeben.
Customer: Heute? Mir wurde jedes Mal, wenn ich angerufen hab, gesagt, drei bis fünf Werktage.
467. Ich verstehe, dass Ihnen dieser Zeitrahmen vorher genannt wurde, und ich entschuldige mich für die widersprüchlichen Informationen. Weil das hier eindeutig ein Fehler in unserer Risikobewertung ist, wende ich einen beschleunigten Freigabecode an, EXP-7734, der die Standardzeitlinie außer Kraft setzt und die Freigabe innerhalb von 2 bis 4 Stunden verarbeitet.
Customer: Ich brauch das schriftlich bestätigt mit der genauen Uhrzeit, wann ich mit den Geldern rechnen kann.
468. Selbstverständlich. Ich schicke Ihnen gerade jetzt eine Bestätigungs-E-Mail an Ihre registrierte Adresse mit der Fallnummer CSE-2025-847291-A. Die Gelder werden bis 15:45 Uhr Eastern Time heute freigegeben und sollten beim heutigen Verarbeitungszyklus auf Ihrem Bankkonto verfügbar sein.
Customer: Was ist mit den Verkäufen, die ich verloren hab, weil ich ohne dieses Kapital keine Bestellungen ausführen konnte?
469. Das ist 'ne sehr berechtigte Sorge, und ich möchte das für Ihr Geschäft wieder gutmachen. Ich bin autorisiert, Ihre Bearbeitungsgebühren für die nächsten 90 Tage zu erlassen, was basierend auf Ihrem durchschnittlichen Volumen ungefähr 2.400 Euro sparen würde. Zusätzlich gewähre ich eine einmalige Gutschrift von 500 Euro für die Unannehmlichkeiten.
Customer: Die erlassenen Gebühren sind ja schön und gut, aber das hat meine Lieferantenbeziehungen ernsthaft beschädigt.
470. Ich verstehe, dass die Auswirkungen weit über die festgehaltenen Gelder hinausgehen. Ich weise Ihnen auch einen persönlichen Account Manager zu, Sarah Chen unter der Durchwahl 5509, die Ihr Konto persönlich überwacht, um sicherzustellen, dass so was nie wieder passiert, und sie kann bei Bedarf auch Bestätigungsschreiben für Lieferanten ausstellen.
Customer: Ich erwarte, dass das das letzte Mal ist, dass ich mich mit diesem Problem rumschlagen muss.
471. Sie haben mein Wort, dass wir dauerhafte Lösungen implementieren, um das zu verhindern. Ich hab den Ausnahmecode PRM-SEASONAL-2025 zu Ihrem Konto hinzugefügt, der Sie von automatischen Sperrungen während Ihrer dokumentierten Hochvolumen-Perioden ausschließt. Sarah Chen wird Sie bis 17:00 Uhr heute anrufen, um alles, was wir besprochen haben, durchzugehen und sicherzustellen, dass die Gelder wie versprochen freigegeben sind.
Customer: Good afternoon. Ich muss meine Kontozahlung besprechen, die morgen fällig ist. Wäre es möglich, eine Verlängerung zu arrangieren?
472. Good afternoon, I'd be happy to assist you with that request. Darf ich nach Ihrer Kontonummer fragen, damit ich Ihre Zahlungshistorie und verfügbare Optionen überprüfen kann?
Customer: Yes, it's 4789-2156-KL. Das ist zeitkritisch, da die Zahlung morgen fällig ist.
473. Thank you, I have your account 4789-2156-KL pulled up here, zeigt eine Zahlung von $2.847,00, fällig am 15. Oktober, also morgen, wie Sie bereits erwähnt haben.
Customer: That's correct. Ich brauche eine siebentägige Verlängerung wegen einer verspäteten Kundenzahlung.
474. I understand the situation. Wenn ich mir Ihre Zahlungshistorie anschaue, haben Sie die letzten 18 Monate einen exzellenten Status beibehalten, keine verspäteten Zahlungen, was definitiv zu Ihren Gunsten für diese Anfrage spricht.
Customer: I appreciate that. Welche Verlängerungsoptionen stehen mir zur Verfügung?
475. Based on your account status, kann ich eine Verlängerung bis zum 22. Oktober autorisieren, das gibt Ihnen die vollen sieben Tage, die Sie angefragt haben, ohne Verspätungsgebühren, wenn die Zahlung bis 17:00 Uhr Eastern Time an diesem Datum eingeht.
Customer: That would work perfectly. Können Sie bestätigen, dass das meine Kreditwürdigkeit nicht beeinträchtigt?
476. Absolutely, I can confirm that. Solange die Zahlung bis zum 22. Oktober um 17:00 Uhr Eastern Time eingeht, wird diese Verlängerung nicht an die Kreditbüros gemeldet und Ihr Konto bleibt in gutem Status.
Customer: Excellent. Werde ich eine schriftliche Bestätigung dieser Verlängerung erhalten?
477. Certainly.
Customer: When should I expect that confirmation, und wie wird sie zugestellt?
478. You'll receive an email confirmation within the next 15 minutes, an Ihre registrierte Adresse mit der Endung @techcorp.com, mit der Verlängerungs-Referenznummer EXT-2024-10-14-7829, die Sie für Ihre Unterlagen aufbewahren sollten.
Customer: Perfect. Gibt es noch etwas, was ich meinerseits tun muss?
479. No additional action is required from you at this time. Die Verlängerung ist jetzt in unserem System aktiv unter der Referenz EXT-2024-10-14-7829, und Sie können die Zahlung jederzeit vor der Frist am 22. Oktober vornehmen.
Customer: Thank you for handling this efficiently. Das hilft wirklich bei meiner Cash-Flow-Situation.
480. You're very welcome. Ich habe auch eine Notiz zu Ihrem Konto über diese genehmigte Verlängerung hinzugefügt, und unsere Buchhaltung wird durch das interne Memo ACC-1047 informiert, damit keine automatischen Mahnungen vor Ihrem neuen Fälligkeitsdatum verschickt werden.
Customer: That's very thorough. Ich schätze Ihre Hilfe heute wirklich.
481. My pleasure. Nur zur Zusammenfassung, Ihr neues Zahlungsfälligkeitsdatum ist der 22. Oktober um 17:00 Uhr Eastern Time für den Betrag von $2.847,00, und Sie haben die Bestätigungsnummer EXT-2024-10-14-7829 für diese Verlängerung.
Customer: Also. Vertriebslizenzen. Schon wieder. Lass mich raten... noch eine Gebühr, von der ich nichts wusste?
482. Oh! Okay, ähm, Brauereilizenzierung. Lass mich mal eben... den richtigen Bildschirm aufrufen. Also Sie rufen an wegen—äh, welche Gebühr genau? Weil es gibt da die TTB-Bundesgenehmigung für 1.000 Dollar, dann die staatliche Vertriebslizenz, die liegt so zwischen 300 und 2.500 Dollar, je nach Ihrer Mengenstufe.
Customer: Hmm, siehst du, das ist halt... ich meine, welche brauche ich denn, um überhaupt Bier verkaufen zu können?
483. Richtig, richtig. Also. Ähm. Eigentlich alle? Sorry, ich weiß, das ist nicht—lass mich das besser erklären. Die TTB-Genehmigung, das ist bundesweit, die brauchen Sie zuerst. Antragsnummer fängt mit TTB-2024 an. Dann Ihre staatliche Lizenz, äh, kommt drauf an, ob Sie selbst vertreiben oder einen Großhändler nutzen.
Customer: Natürlich. Mehrere Gebühren. Weil eine ja zu einfach wäre, ne?
484. Ja, ich—ich versteh die Frustration total. Ehrlich? Das System ist... es ist kompliziert. Aber okay, also, lass mich mal Ihren Standort checken. Was ist Ihre Postleitzahl? Weil manche Staaten haben, äh, vereinfachte Verfahren, wo Sie alles zusammen unter Formular ALC-COMBO-7 einreichen können.
Customer: 97202. Portland. Wo beim Thema Bier nichts jemals einfach ist.
485. Portland! Oh gut, eigentlich—also, relativ gute Nachrichten. Oregon hat den OLCC-Einheitsantrag. Also das ist... hmm, warte mal... 300 Dollar für die Brauerei-Lizenz, dann wenn Sie Vertrieb machen, sind's nochmal 100 Dollar pro County. Referenzcode OLCC-DIST-45B. Viel besser als, äh, zum Beispiel New York, wo Sie mit mindestens 4.400 Dollar rechnen müssen.
Customer: Moment, pro County? Also wenn ich in drei Counties verkaufen will, sind das...
486. Dreihundert extra, ja. Aber! Ähm, es gibt tatsächlich einen Mengenrabatt ab dem zweiten County. Also das wäre... lass mich rechnen... 300 Dollar Basis, 100 für County eins, 100 für County zwei, dann 75 für den dritten. Macht insgesamt 575 plus diese TTB-Bundesgebühr.
Customer: Mmm. Und wie lange dauert dieser ganze... Prozess angeblich?
487. Also die TTB. Die ist hart. Aktuelle Bearbeitungszeit zeigt... uff, 95 bis 120 Tage. Oregon OLCC aber? Viel schneller. Normalerweise 14 bis 21 Arbeitstage, wenn Sie elektronisch über Portal-Code OLCC-ONLINE-BREW einreichen.
Customer: Fünfundneunzig Tage. Beim Bund. Das ist ja... fantastisch.
488. Ich weiß. Ich weiß, das ist—hören Sie, ähm, mal unter uns? Reichen Sie den Bundesantrag HEUTE ein. Also, selbst wenn Sie noch nicht bereit sind. Weil die Uhr läuft ab dem Moment, wo Sie Antrag TTB-F-5100-31 einreichen, und Sie können Details später noch ändern, während er bearbeitet wird.
Customer: Hm. Okay also... jetzt einreichen, später korrigieren? Das funktioniert wirklich?
489. Absolut. Ja. Ich hab schon so viele Brauer gesehen, die warten, bis alles perfekt ist und dann—äh, dann hängen sie vier Monate fest, bevor sie öffnen können. Solange Ihre Grunddaten stimmen, Betriebsadresse, EIN-Nummer 95-7*******, all das? Können Sie Produktionsschätzungen, Geräteangaben, was auch immer, später noch ändern.
Customer: Lass mich mal überlegen... was ist, wenn wir schon auf Bauernmärkten verkaufen?
490. Oh! Hmm. Ganz andere Geschichte. Das ist... da brauchen Sie eine temporäre Verkaufsgenehmigung. Formular OLCC-TEMP-3. Die kosten 50 Dollar pro Veranstaltung, ODER, eigentlich—es gibt eine Jahres-Bauernmarkt-Lizenz für 250 Dollar, die unbegrenzte Märkte abdeckt. Viel besserer Deal, wenn Sie mehr als fünf Events pro Jahr machen.
Customer: Jahreslizenz. Klar. Natürlich versteckt sich da noch eine Gebühr...
491. Ja, die Gebühren häufen sich halt. Ähm. Schon. Aber hey, wenigstens verlangt Oregon keine separate Vertriebskaution? Manche Staaten wollen 10.000 Dollar Bürgschaft nur für Eigenvertrieb. Aktennummer BOND-DIST-2024. Kleine Siege, oder?
Customer: Guten Tag. Ich muss mit jemandem über die Erstattungsnummer RF-4829 sprechen.
492. Alles klar, moment, ich ruf das mal auf—RF-4829, okay okay, ich seh hier die ganze Historie und wow, Sie warten schon seit dem 15. Oktober, das ist wirklich absolut inakzeptabel von unserer Seite.
Customer: Ja. Zwei verschiedene Mitarbeiter haben mir eine beschleunigte Bearbeitung versprochen.
493. Stimmt stimmt, ich seh hier Vermerke vom 22. Oktober und 3. November, beide mit Prioritätsstufe P2-HOCH markiert, und keiner von beiden hat das tatsächlich durchgezogen—ganz ehrlich, da hat unser internes System Sie komplett im Stich gelassen.
Customer: Das hat der letzte Mitarbeiter auch gesagt. Und dann ist nichts passiert.
494. Hören Sie, ich mach den Job seit acht Jahren und wenn ich solche Notizen sehe—Ticket TKT-9847-B steht immer noch auf ausstehend—weiß ich genau, wo's hakt, unsere Erstattungswarteschlange läuft voll und Prioritätsmarkierungen werden halt manchmal einfach ignoriert.
Customer: Also was—warte mal—was passiert jetzt genau?
495. Okay, also was ich jetzt anders mache—ich umgehe die Warteschlange komplett und reiche das direkt über unser Executive Resolution Portal ein, Fallnummer EXC-7723-RF, das wird innerhalb von maximal 24 bis 48 Stunden bearbeitet.
Customer: Mhm. Und wie unterscheidet sich das von der beschleunigten Bearbeitung?
496. Executive Resolution hat auch wirklich Biss—das ist, das ist ein komplett anderes System mit einer Abschlussrate von 98,7 Prozent innerhalb einer Woche, während unsere normale Erstattungswarteschlange, also unter uns gesagt, gerade so ungefähr 21 Tage hinterherhinkt.
Customer: Ich führe eine Praxis. Ich kann dem nicht ewig hinterherlaufen.
497. Absolut, und als ich selbst mal selbstständig war, bevor ich hier angefangen hab, weiß ich, Zeit ist Geld—Ihr ursprünglicher Betrag von 847,23 Euro plus ich füge einen Service-Gutschriftcode SVC-DELAY-15 für fünfzehn Prozent zusätzliche Entschädigung für die Unannehmlichkeiten hinzu.
Customer: Ähm. Okay. Also wann wird das dann bearbeitet?
498. Mal sehen... heute ist Donnerstag, das Executive Portal zeigt garantierte Einzahlung bis Geschäftsschluss Montag, 13. November, und Sie bekommen innerhalb der nächsten zwei Stunden eine Bestätigungsmail an Ihre hinterlegte Adresse.
Customer: Die E-Mail ist immer noch info at bodywork wellness punkt com?
499. Hmm, hier steht eigentlich admin at bodywork wellness—warte warte, es sind zwei hinterlegt, lassen Sie mich kurz verifizieren, an welche die Bestätigung mit der Tracking-Nummer TRK-48293-BWC gehen soll.
Customer: Info. Immer info. Admin war nur vorübergehend.
500. Perfekt, geändert auf info at bodywork wellness, und damit Sie's für Ihre Unterlagen haben, Ihre neue Eskalationsnummer ist EXC-7723-RF, nicht mehr die alte RF-4829, das ist die Nummer, die jetzt wirklich zählt.
Customer: Gut. Montag. Oder ich rufe Dienstag wieder an.
501. Das werden Sie nicht müssen—aber falls doch irgendwas schiefläuft, fragen Sie direkt nach Tier-3-Support, nennen Sie meine Mitarbeiter-ID AGT-4419, dann sehen die, dass ich bereits den Override-Code OVR-EXEC-7723 autorisiert hab, der eine sofortige manuelle Bearbeitung erzwingt.
Customer: I need to downgrade my business subscription from the Premium to Standard plan immediately.
502. I understand completely. Let me pull up your account right away. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your subscription?
Customer: The account email is operations@meridiantech.com and the account number should be BUS-4472-XX.
503. Perfect, thank you. I have your account here showing the Premium plan at $299 monthly under account BUS-4472-XX. Before we proceed with the downgrade, may I ask what specific features you're looking to adjust?
Customer: We're restructuring our budget and the advanced analytics features aren't being utilized enough to justify the cost.
504. I appreciate you sharing that context. The Standard plan at $149 monthly includes your core features like project management, team collaboration for up to 25 users, and basic reporting. You would lose access to the advanced analytics suite and priority support.
Customer: That's acceptable. What's the process for making this change and when would it take effect?
505. Certainly. I can process this change right now and it would take effect at your next billing cycle on December 15th. You'll receive a prorated credit of $127.50 for the remaining Premium days, which will be applied to your Standard plan invoice.
Customer: Actually, is there any way to make the change effective immediately rather than waiting?
506. Absolutely, I can make that happen. Let me override the standard billing cycle and process this as ticket TKT-9823-MD. The change will be active within the next 2 hours and you'll see the prorated credit today.
Customer: That's excellent. Will I lose access to my current data or need to migrate anything?
507. Not at all. All your existing data, projects, and user configurations remain intact. The only change is that reports generated after the downgrade won't include the advanced metrics from modules AM-7 through AM-12.
Customer: Good to know. Can you send me written confirmation of these changes and the new billing structure?
508. Of course. I'm preparing a detailed confirmation email right now with reference number REF-2024-112-8847. It will include your new subscription terms, the credit amount, and a comparison chart of your previous versus current features.
Customer: I also need to ensure my team leaders are notified about the feature changes before they lose access.
509. That's very thoughtful planning. I can schedule an automated notification to be sent to all admin users on your account 24 hours before the change completes. Would you like me to include a custom message from you?
Customer: Yes, please add that they should export any advanced analytics reports they need by end of day tomorrow.
510. Perfect, I've added that message. The notification will go out at 3:00 PM your time zone, giving everyone approximately 23 hours to export their reports. Is there anything else you'd like me to address regarding this transition?
Customer: That covers everything. I appreciate how smoothly you've handled this process.
511. Thank you so much for that feedback. Your new Standard plan will be active within 2 hours, confirmation email with reference REF-2024-112-8847 is on its way, and your team will be notified tomorrow. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you need anything else.
Customer: Ich muss da eine Abbuchung reklamieren, aber ich muss leise sprechen während der Mittagsruhe.
512. Verstehe ich vollkommen. Danke für Ihren Anruf wegen Ihres Kontos. Ich helfe Ihnen gerne, diese Reklamation schnell und effizient zu klären. Darf ich Ihre Kontonummer haben oder die Telefonnummer, die mit Ihrem Vertrag verknüpft ist?
Customer: Die Nummer ist 555-0847. Da ist eine 90-Euro-Auslandsgebühr, die ich nie verursacht hab.
513. Danke schön. Ich hab Ihr Konto mit der Endung 0847 gefunden und kann die Auslandsgebühr über 90,00 Euro vom 12. November sehen. Der Anruf zeigt eine 47-minütige Verbindung nach Deutschland um 14:34 Uhr Ostküstenzeit.
Customer: Das kann gar nicht sein. Da war ich gerade beim Stuhlkreis und mein Handy lag in der Schreibtischschublade.
514. Ich verstehe Ihre Bedenken. Lassen Sie mich mal die detaillierten Verbindungsdaten für diesen Zeitraum durchgehen. Ich sehe hier, dass Ihr typisches Nutzungsmuster in den letzten 24 Monaten keine Auslandsgespräche zeigt, was diese Gebühr wirklich ungewöhnlich macht.
Customer: Eben! Ich ruf nur Eltern und meine Familie an, alles Ortsnummern.
515. Ich leite sofort eine Betrugsuntersuchung ein. Die Fallnummer FRD-2847-NK9 wurde für diese strittige Abbuchung angelegt. Während wir das untersuchen, buche ich Ihnen ab heute eine vorläufige Gutschrift von 90,00 Euro auf Ihr Konto.
Customer: Perfekt. Wie lange dauert die Untersuchung? Ich brauch das geklärt vor der Monatsendabrechnung.
516. Auf jeden Fall. Die Untersuchung dauert normalerweise so 5-7 Werktage, also deutlich vor Ihrem Abrechnungszyklus am 1. Dezember. Sie bekommen innerhalb der nächsten 30 Minuten eine E-Mail-Bestätigung an Ihre registrierte Adresse mit allen Falldetails.
Customer: Wird das meinen Service beeinträchtigen? Ich kann während der Arbeitszeiten keine Unterbrechungen gebrauchen.
517. Ihr Service läuft ohne Unterbrechung weiter. Ich hab eine Schutzmarkierung PRT-4521 auf Ihr Konto gesetzt, damit es während der Untersuchung zu keinen Service-Einschränkungen kommt. Zusätzlich aktiviere ich erweiterte Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, um zukünftige unberechtigte Abbuchungen zu verhindern.
Customer: Gut. Sollte ich vorsichtshalber meine Konto-PIN ändern?
518. Das ist eine ausgezeichnete Vorsichtsmaßnahme. Ich kann Ihnen dabei gleich helfen. Geben Sie mir bitte eine neue 6-stellige PIN, dann aktivier ich die sofort im System.
Customer: Nehmen wir 428-517. Ach, und können Sie mir noch eine Dokumentation per E-Mail schicken für meine Unterlagen?
519. Selbstverständlich.
Customer: Noch was. Gibt es andere verdächtige Abbuchungen, von denen ich wissen sollte?
520. Ich hab Ihre Aktivitäten der letzten 90 Tage gründlich durchgeschaut. Die Abbuchung vom 12. November ist die einzige Auffälligkeit. Alle anderen Gebühren entsprechen Ihrem normalen Nutzungsmuster von ungefähr 850 Inlandsminuten monatlich, also gut innerhalb Ihres Tarifvolumens.
Customer: Das beruhigt mich. Danke, dass Sie das so effizient geregelt haben.
521. Sehr gerne. Ihr Fall FRD-2847-NK9 hat jetzt Prioritätsstatus, und Sie bekommen Updates per E-Mail und SMS. Kann ich Ihnen noch bei was anderem helfen, wobei ich natürlich auf Ihre zeitlichen Einschränkungen Rücksicht nehme?
Customer: Ich ich bin ausgesperrt. Zu viele Versuche. Muss... muss einfach rein.
522. Ah okay, also lass mich mal nachschauen, ähm, was da passiert ist halt nach 5 fehlgeschlagenen Versuchen sperrt das System aus Sicherheitsgründen. Ich denk mal ich kann das aber zurücksetzen—wie ist denn die E-Mail vom Account?
Customer: Das ist das ist j.martinez bei... warte. Nein. J-M-A-R-T... zweiundsiebzig. Gmail.
523. Alles klar also j.martinez72@gmail.com, lass mich mal eben—hm, das ist ja interessant. Hier steht, dass, äh, jemand von drei verschiedenen Standorten versucht hat sich einzuloggen? New York um 14:47 Uhr, dann Dallas, dann Seattle alles innerhalb von Minuten. Waren Sie das?
Customer: Nein. Nein nein nein. Nur ich. Hier. In Portland.
524. Hmm okay das ist echt komisch dann. Also was ich denke ist vielleicht versucht jemand in Ihren Account zu kommen? Lass mich mal das, äh—ja das Sicherheitsprotokoll zeigt Versuchs-ID SEC-4829-XK und es ist als verdächtig markiert. Ich kann irgendwie verstehen warum es Sie so krass ausgesperrt hat.
Customer: Super. Jemand... jemand versucht mich zu hacken. Heute. Ausgerechnet heute.
525. Na ja eigentlich—warte lass mich das genauer anschauen. Die Versuche benutzen, mmm, alte Passwörter? So von vor 6 Monaten laut Hash-ID PWH-7263-B? Das ist irgendwie merkwürdig. Haben Sie vielleicht kürzlich Ihr Passwort geändert und es vergessen?
Customer: Ich... ja. Ja ja. Letzte Woche geändert. Hab hab das alte benutzt.
526. Ah! Okay also also das erklärt's. Sie haben im Grunde gegen sich selbst gekämpft, äh, aus Gewohnheit sozusagen. Gut ich entsperre das jetzt aber zuerst—wissen Sie noch das neue Passwort das Sie gesetzt haben? Weil sonst müssen wir Verifizierungsstufe 2 machen.
Customer: Denk schon. Ziemlich sicher. Bitte bitte entsperren Sie's einfach.
527. Klar, entsperre jetzt... so, erledigt, freigeschaltet. Aber, ähm, ich sollte erwähnen—wenn Sie nochmal scheitern wird's für 24 Stunden gesperrt statt nur 30 Minuten. Das System eskaliert nach so vielen Versuchen, Protokoll-ID PROT-892-LK.
Customer: Vierundzwanzig Stunden? Das das geht nicht. Brauch das heute.
528. Ja nee das versteh ich total. Also hier ist was ich vorschlagen würde—vielleicht schreiben Sie das Passwort mal kurz auf? Oder eigentlich, hmm, wir haben da so'n Ding wo ich dranbleiben könnte während Sie sich einloggen. Dann wenn's schiefgeht kann ich's sofort wieder entsperren.
Customer: Sie würden... Sie würden das machen? Echt?
529. Na klar! Das ist wirklich kein Problem. Öffnen Sie einfach, äh, die Login-Seite und ich warte. Lassen Sie sich aber Zeit—kein Stress.
Customer: Okay okay. Tippe jetzt... es ist... oh Gott. Hat geklappt. Endlich endlich geklappt.
530. Perfekt! Also ich seh hier Sie sind drin, Session-ID SESS-3847-Q aktiv. Eigentlich wo ich Sie schon hab—soll ich vielleicht 'ne Backup-Authentifizierungsmethode einrichten? So wie Telefonnummer für SMS-Codes? Falls das nochmal passiert?
Customer: Ja. Bitte. Danke danke. Das war... Sie haben mich echt gerettet.
531. Ach ich bin einfach froh dass wir's hingekriegt haben! Also lass mich mal das SMS-Backup einrichten—was ist die beste Nummer? Und dann, halt, sind Sie komplett abgesichert mit Fallback-Option TYPE-2FA aktiviert.
Customer: Die Transaktion hängt jetzt schon seit drei Tagen fest. Das muss endlich geklärt werden.
532. Oh, das ist ja wirklich komisch—drei Tage ist definitiv viel zu lange. Ähm, lass mich mal dein Konto aufrufen, kannst du mir deine E-Mail geben oder die Transaktionsnummer, falls du sie hast?
Customer: Hmm, warte mal kurz... es ist TRX—ach nee, Moment—TR4-8829-QM.
533. Perfekt, also ich schau mir hier die Transaktion TR4-8829-QM an, und äh, ich sehe, sie steht seit Montag um 14:47 Uhr auf "ausstehend" für 284,50 Euro. Das ist... also das ist wirklich seltsam, weil unser System die normalerweise innerhalb von maximal 24 Stunden abwickelt.
Customer: Genau. Also wo hakt's denn?
534. Ich glaube—nee warte, lass mich erst was nachschauen. Okay, also hier ist eine Markierung, Code ERR-7736, was im Grunde bedeutet, dass das Payment Gateway versucht hat, es zu verarbeiten, aber irgendwas auf der Händlerseite hat nicht richtig reagiert. Sozusagen als wäre die Transaktion im Limbo steckengeblieben.
Customer: Na toll. Einfach klasse. Hör mal, ich weiß, du kannst nichts dafür, aber ich brauch das heute noch erledigt.
535. Nee nee, ich versteh das total, das ist echt mega frustrierend. Ähm, also was ich machen kann—ich sehe, dein Konto hat Verifizierungsstufe VL-3, das heißt, ich kann das tatsächlich selbst freigeben, anstatt es weiterzuleiten.
Customer: Okay, das bedeutet also... was, du kannst es jetzt entsperren?
536. Im Prinzip ja! Ich meine, ich muss es durch unser manuelles Override-System MOS-2.0 laufen lassen, aber das dauert normalerweise vielleicht fünf Minuten? Die Transaktion sollte dann entweder durchgehen oder komplett auf dein Konto zurückgebucht werden mit Referenznummer REF-9982-XK.
Customer: Fünf Minuten. Gut. Mach das.
537. Bin schon dabei—ich hab die Override-Anfrage OR-6643 um, mal schauen, 10:32 Uhr gestartet. Also bis 10:37 sollten wir wissen, was passiert. Das System schickt dir wahrscheinlich gleich eine SMS zur Bestätigung.
Customer: Noch nichts. Warte—okay, SMS ist gerade gekommen.
538. Oh super! Das ging ja echt schnell. Was für ein Verifizierungscode hat er dir geschickt?
Customer: Es ist 7-7-3... äh nee, sorry, 7-3-3-2.
539. Perfekt, gebe 7332 ein und... okay, das ist interessant. Also es sieht so aus, als wäre der ursprüngliche Händler, ähm, tatsächlich am Montag wegen Wartungsarbeiten offline gegangen, genau als deine Transaktion verarbeitet werden sollte.
Customer: Natürlich. Und jetzt?
540. Na ja, die gute Nachricht ist—und das ist ehrlich gesagt das beste Szenario—da es auf deren Seite nie vollständig verarbeitet wurde, kann ich das Ganze jetzt einfach rückgängig machen. Deine 284,50 Euro sollten innerhalb von, ich würd sagen, maximal zwei Stunden wieder auf deinem Konto sein?
Customer: Zwei Stunden. Okay. Danke, dass du das tatsächlich gelöst hast.
541. Hey, gar kein Problem! Deine Storno-Bestätigung ist RVS-4420-ZM, falls du sie für deine Unterlagen brauchst. Und ganz ehrlich? Wenn's bis mittags nicht da ist, ruf auf jeden Fall nochmal an und gib die Fallnummer CS-889214 an, dann kann derjenige, der drangeht, das sofort beschleunigen.
Customer: Guten Tag. Ich hänge seit 67 Minuten in der Warteschleife, trying to reach your department. Können Sie mir das erklären?
542. Das tut mir aufrichtig leid für diese übermäßige Wartezeit. Ich hole sofort Ihr Konto auf den Bildschirm, and we'll resolve whatever brought you here today. Darf ich Ihre Kontonummer haben?
Customer: Es ist 445823. Ich muss verstehen, was diese Verzögerungen verursacht, and how you'll prevent this going forward.
543. Danke, ich habe Ihr Konto 445823 jetzt vor mir. Unser Anrufvolumen ist heute Morgen um 340% gestiegen, due to a system outage affecting our automated services. Ich verstehe Ihre Frustration mit der Wartezeit vollkommen.
Customer: Was genau ist in Ihrem System ausgefallen? Und noch wichtiger, what compensation are you offering for my wasted time?
544. Unser Zahlungsverarbeitungsmodul ist um 8:47 Uhr Eastern offline gegangen, wodurch alle Transaktionen über manuelle Verifizierung laufen mussten. Ich bin autorisiert, Ihrem Konto eine Gutschrift von $50 für diese Unannehmlichkeit gutzuschreiben.
Customer: Das ist ein Anfang. Now, what did I actually wait 67 minutes to discuss? Meine Rechnung hat Fehler.
545. Natürlich.
Customer: Rechnungsnummer 78234-B zeigt drei doppelte Gebühren für denselben Service am 15. Oktober.
546. Ich sehe das Problem deutlich bei Rechnung 78234-B. Sie wurden dreimal mit je $127.99 für Ihr Premium-Service-Paket belastet, when it should have been a single monthly charge. Ich veranlasse diese Korrekturen sofort.
Customer: Bitte erklären Sie mir, wie doppelte Gebühren in Ihrem Abrechnungssystem überhaupt auftreten können. This shouldn't be technically possible.
547. Sie haben absolut recht, das zu hinterfragen. Unser Billing-System macht Batch-Processing alle 4 Stunden, und während des Wartungsfensters am 15. Oktober ist Job-ID BX-20241015-0800 dreimal gelaufen, due to a timeout error that wasn't properly logged.
Customer: Sie sagen mir also, Ihre Fehlerbehandlung hat versagt? How many other customers were affected by this?
548. Dieser spezifische Batch-Fehler hat 1.247 Konten während dieses Wartungsfensters betroffen. Wir haben seitdem zusätzliche Validierungsprüfungen implementiert, die doppelte Job-Ausführungen verhindern, with error code monitoring upgraded to real-time alerts.
Customer: Gut. Wann sehe ich die korrigierten Gebühren in meinem Konto reflektiert?
549. Ich bearbeite die Rückbuchung gerade mit Bestätigungsnummer REF-20241122-AA8K. Sie sehen die Gutschrift von $255.98 innerhalb von 24 Stunden, and I'm also waiving your next month's fee as additional compensation.
Customer: Das ist akzeptabel. Können Sie mir eine E-Mail mit der Dokumentation dieses gesamten Problems und der Lösung schicken?
550. Absolut. Ich sende eine detaillierte Fallzusammenfassung an Ihre hinterlegte E-Mail-Adresse, which includes case number CS-445823-1122, alle Transaktionsreferenzen und meine direkte Durchwahl 4019, falls Sie zukünftig sofortige Hilfe brauchen.
Customer: Danke. Eine letzte Frage—what assurance do I have this won't happen again?
551. Wir haben drei spezifische Sicherheitsmaßnahmen implementiert: Duplikat-Erkennungsalgorithmus Version 2.3.1, Echtzeit-Transaktionsüberwachung mit 15-Sekunden-Intervallen, and manual review flags for any charge exceeding $100. Ihr Konto hat jetzt auch Prioritätsstatus, um Standard-Wartezeiten zu umgehen.
Customer: Super. Noch so eine Telefonwarteschleife. Endlich. Ein Mensch. Ich muss jemanden zu meinem Konto hinzufügen.
552. Oh absolut, da kann ich helfen. Lass mich nur, ähm, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen... okay, also ich muss verifizieren—warten Sie, Entschuldigung, Vorname auf dem Konto?
Customer: Es ist Marcus. Thompson. Mit P. Logisch.
553. Verstanden verstanden, Marcus Thompson, und, hmm, lass mich mal sehen... Ihre Kontonummer endet auf 7294, stimmt das—stimmt das?
Customer: Ja das—warte, nein. Entschuldigung. 7249. Andersrum.
554. Perfekt, okay also 7249, und, äh, zur Sicherheit brauche ich Ihre Rechnungs-PLZ, die sollte... lass mich nachdenken... fängt mit 9 an?
Customer: 94016. Menlo Park. Das schicke.
555. Ahh richtig richtig, 94016, okay perfekt. Also, ähm, ich schaue auf Ihr Konto MTA-82947-XK und, hmm, Sie möchten einen autorisierten Nutzer hinzufügen, was super ist, I actually—I always recommend this for security.
Customer: Sicherheit. Klar. Es ist für meine Assistentin. Sind Sie sicher, dass das nichts durcheinanderbringt?
556. Oh nein nein, keine Sorge, ich werde—lass mich sicherstellen, dass wir das richtig machen. Also im Grunde bekommt sie, äh, begrenzten Zugangscode LAC-4419, which means they can view statements, aber, ähm, sie kann nicht—sie kann keine wichtigen Einstellungen ändern.
Customer: Begrenzter Zugang. Okay. But they can pay bills?
557. Ja ja, absolut. Also was ich mache ist, hmm, sie mit Transaktionslevel TL-3 einrichten, which covers payments, basic inquiries, aber, äh, nichts Strukturelles—eigentlich warte, wollen Sie, dass sie auch Rückerstattungen bearbeitet?
Customer: Rückerstattungen? Gott nein. Nur Rechnungen. Das reicht.
558. Klug klug, okay also, äh, keine Rückerstattungen. Lass mich nur... okay, ich brauche ihren vollständigen amtlichen Namen, und, ähm, ihre E-Mail für den Portal-Zugangs-PIN-887.
Customer: Rachel Chen. Das ist C-H-E-N. Nicht wie alle annehmen.
559. Rachel Chen, verstanden, und, ähm, die E-Mail-Adresse? Ich schicke—ich schicke ihr sofort ihr temporäres Passwort, expires in 24 hours though.
Customer: Es ist rchen at workplace dash solutions dot com. Alles kleingeschrieben. Logisch. Will this actually work by tomorrow?
560. Oh definitiv, also eigentlich ist es—es ist sofort. Sobald ich hier auf Senden klicke, Rachel bekommt E-Mail-Bestätigung EC-9982-T, und, ähm, sie kann sich sofort einloggen. Obwohl, hmm, erste Anmeldung erfordert diesen Verifizierungscode, den ich schicke.
Customer: Gut. Super. Also sie. Loggt sich ein. Und es funktioniert?
561. Genau genau, sie loggt sich ein, gibt Code VER-4456-QM aus der E-Mail ein, setzt ihr eigenes Passwort, und, äh, sie ist startklar. Ich habe auch—eigentlich habe ich hier eine Notiz hinzugefügt, so if she ever calls us, we know she's authorized. Sie sind fertig!
Customer: Guten Morgen. Mein Fahrerkonto wurde heute Morgen ohne jede Vorwarnung oder Erklärung deaktiviert. Ich brauche sofort eine Lösung, this is my primary source of income.
562. Guten Morgen und vielen Dank, dass Sie sich an den Fahrer-Support wenden. Ich verstehe die Dringlichkeit dieser Situation vollkommen, and I'll do everything possible to help you today. Darf ich Ihre Fahrer-ID oder die E-Mail-Adresse haben, die mit Ihrem Konto verknüpft ist?
Customer: Die E-Mail ist james.chen@email.com, und ich bin seit über 2 Jahren aktiver Fahrer mit ausgezeichneten Bewertungen.
563. Vielen Dank, Herr Chen. Ich habe Ihr Konto gefunden, driver ID DRV-4829-KCM, und ich sehe, Sie haben 4,9 Sterne bei über 3200 abgeschlossenen Lieferungen. Lassen Sie mich sofort die Details der Deaktivierung überprüfen.
Customer: Was hat diese Deaktivierung ausgelöst? Ich habe gestern Abend drei Lieferungen ohne Probleme abgeschlossen.
564. Ich sehe hier, dass das System Ihr Konto heute um 2:47 Uhr morgens markiert hat, there was an unusual login attempt from IP address 192.168.45.231 in Bangkok, Thailand. Das scheint eine Sicherheitsmaßnahme zu sein.
Customer: Das macht überhaupt keinen Sinn. Ich bin in Chicago und bin nirgendwo hingereist. Könnte das ein Fehler sein, or is someone trying to hack my account?
565. Genau danach sieht es aus. Ihr normaler Login-Verlauf zeigt konsistenten Zugriff aus dem Raum Chicago, specifically from IP range 73.202.XXX.XXX, also hat dieser ausländische Zugriff unser automatisches Sicherheitsprotokoll ausgelöst. Ich leite sofort eine Sicherheitsüberprüfung ein.
Customer: Wie lange wird diese Überprüfung dauern? Ich habe geplante Schichten, die um 12 Uhr mittags beginnen.
566. Ich verstehe Ihre Sorge wegen der Mittagsschichten völlig. Ich eskaliere das an unser Trust and Safety Team mit Prioritätscode SEC-URGENT-7792, which typically gets a response within 30 to 60 minutes.
Customer: Muss ich zusätzliche Verifizierung oder Dokumente vorlegen, um meine Identität zu beweisen?
567. Ja, ich muss jetzt Ihre Identität verifizieren. Bitte bestätigen Sie die letzten vier Ziffern des Bankkontos, das mit Ihrem Fahrerprofil verknüpft ist.
Customer: Die letzten vier Ziffern sind 8847. Sollte ich auch mein Passwort zur Sicherheit ändern?
568. Danke, das stimmt mit unseren Unterlagen überein. Ja, ich empfehle dringend, Ihr Passwort sofort zu aktualisieren. Ich schicke Ihnen jetzt einen sicheren Reset-Link an Ihre E-Mail, reference number PWR-6634-QAM.
Customer: Ich habe den Link erhalten. Wird mein Konto automatisch reaktiviert, once I reset the password?
569. Nicht automatisch, aber ich füge Notizen zu Ihrer Fallakte CSE-9821-DDK hinzu, die bestätigen, dass Ihre Identität verifiziert wurde und das Passwort zurückgesetzt ist. Das Trust and Safety Team wird das sehen, and that should expedite the reactivation process.
Customer: Können Sie garantieren, dass ich meine Mittagsschichten arbeiten kann? Das kostet mich Geld, every hour it remains deactivated.
570. Ich verstehe Ihre Frustration vollkommen. Obwohl ich den genauen Zeitpunkt nicht garantieren kann, habe ich Ihren Fall als einkommensrelevant markiert mit erwarteter Lösung bis 11:30 Uhr Ihrer Zeit. Sie erhalten eine SMS an 312-555-8847, once the reactivation is complete.
Customer: Ich schätze Ihre Hilfe sehr. Wird es eine Entschädigung für diese verlorene Zeit geben, if this was indeed a false security flag?
571. Das ist eine berechtigte Frage. Sobald Ihr Konto reaktiviert ist, können Sie einen Entschädigungsantrag über das Formular COMP-2024-0112 einreichen, and given this appears to be an erroneous deactivation, unser Team genehmigt normalerweise einen Tagesdurchschnitt basierend auf Ihrer 28-Tage-Historie, was bei Ihnen einen Durchschnitt von 187 Dollar täglich zeigt.
Customer: I unsubscribed from your marketing emails three weeks ago, but I'm still receiving multiple messages daily. This needs to stop.
572. I sincerely apologize for this issue. Let me access your account immediately to investigate. May I have the email address that's receiving these messages?
Customer: It's robert.chen@techconsult.net. I've unsubscribed twice now through your system.
573. Thank you. I've located your account, ID number RCH-847392. I can see your unsubscribe request was processed on November 2, 2024, at 3:47 PM Eastern Time. Let me check our email suppression list.
Customer: If it was processed, why am I still getting emails? I received four just yesterday.
574. I've identified the issue. Your email was successfully removed from our primary marketing list MAR-2024-Q4, but you're still active on three subsidiary lists: TECH-NEWS-847, PROD-UPDATE-223, and WEBINAR-INVITE-Q4.
Customer: That's unacceptable. When I unsubscribe, it should remove me from everything. How did this happen?
575. You're absolutely right. Our unsubscribe process should remove you from all lists simultaneously. This appears to be a synchronization error between our systems that occurred during our October 28, 2024 database migration.
Customer: Are there other customers experiencing this? And what about my rights under CAN-SPAM regulations?
576. Certainly.
Customer: I need specifics. How many people are affected and what are you doing about it?
577. Our audit shows 1,847 customers were affected by this synchronization issue. We've already corrected 1,203 accounts as of yesterday, with full resolution expected by end of business today, November 23, 2024.
Customer: What compensation are you offering for this violation? This has been going on for three weeks.
578. I understand your frustration completely. I'm authorized to issue a $75 credit to your account, reference code COMP-2024-NOV-8473, and I'm escalating this to our compliance team for additional review.
Customer: That's a start. Can you guarantee I won't receive any more emails after today?
579. Absolutely. I'm manually removing your email from all 14 active lists in our system right now. The suppression will be complete within the next 15 minutes, confirmation number SUP-884739-FINAL.
Customer: I want written confirmation of this removal and the steps you've taken.
580. Of course. I'll send a detailed confirmation to your email within the hour, including case number CS-2024-112384, all affected list IDs, and timestamps of each removal action.
Customer: Good. And if I receive even one more marketing email after today?
581. Should that occur, contact us immediately with reference number PRI-ESCALATE-8847. You'll be connected directly to our compliance team, and we'll implement additional remediation including potential compensation up to $500 under our service guarantee policy SG-2024-15.
Customer: [sharp inhale] Ich muss wissen, was das mit der Vertragsauflösung ist, also, was für Gebühren da anfallen, weil ich vielleicht umziehen muss und—
582. Oh Mann, Vorfälligkeitsentschädigung, ja die sind echt übel, ähm, lass mich mal schnell dein Konto aufrufen—was ist deine Kundennummer? Warte mal, ich kann ja über die Telefonnummer suchen, äh, 555-7823 stimmt's? Perfekt, also du hast den Premium24-Tarif, der im März 2024 angefangen hat.
Customer: Warte, März? [exhale] Scheiße, das heißt ich bin erst 6 Monate dabei? Das ist ja noch schlimmer als gedacht.
583. Ja also, äh, ganz ehrlich? Die Gebühren sind echt brutal. Du schaust auf 450 Euro Grundgebühr plus, ähm, 20 Euro für jeden verbleibenden Monat, also bei 18 Monaten macht das—moment, das sind 810 Euro insgesamt. Ich weiß, ist total bescheuert, diese Verträge sind halt dafür gemacht, die Leute in die Falle zu locken.
Customer: Achthundert— [sharp breath] Das kann ich mir nicht leisten, wirklich nicht, und der Umzug steht noch nicht mal fest, aber vielleicht hab ich keine andere Wahl und—
584. Okay okay warte mal, ähm, lass mich mal was checken—manchmal gibt's da Spielraum. Also du hast gesagt Umzug? Wenn's beruflich ist, haben wir diese Regelung, äh, Code REL-WORK-2024, da werden bis zu 50 Prozent erlassen, wenn du mehr als, ähm, 75 Kilometer wegen nem Job umziehst.
Customer: Es ist aber nicht beruflich, es ist... [long exhale] es ist kompliziert, Familiensache, ich weiß einfach nicht, was ich machen soll.
585. Verstehe verstehe, Familiensachen sind hart. Hmm, warte mal—ich seh hier was Interessantes. Du bist seit, äh, 2019 bei uns? 5 Jahre insgesamt über verschiedene Tarife? Damit hast du Legacy-Status, was, äh, eigentlich keiner weiß, aber das eröffnet dir einige Optionen.
Customer: [breath] Legacy-Status? Was soll das denn sein? Davon hat mir keiner was erzählt.
586. Genau genau genau, die bewerben das nicht, weil sie, ähm, ehrlich gesagt nicht wollen, dass die Leute das nutzen. Aber im Grunde mit Legacy Stufe 3, wofür du seit September 2024 qualifiziert bist, kannst du einmalig den Vertrag pausieren für bis zu, äh, 6 Monate. Bleibt technisch gesehen aktiv, aber keine monatlichen Kosten, verlängert nur dein Enddatum.
Customer: Also ich könnte den einfach... pausieren? [sharp inhale] Aber was ist, wenn ich danach doch kündigen muss?
587. Ja also hier ist die Sache, äh, und ich sollte dir das vermutlich nicht sagen, aber egal—wenn du jetzt pausierst und dann im siebten Monat kündigst? Das System berechnet die Gebühren nur ab dem Pausierungsdatum, nicht ab dem ursprünglichen Start. Also statt 18 verbleibenden Monaten zeigt's dann, ähm, einen Monat. Das wären dann so, äh, 470 Euro insgesamt statt 810.
Customer: [exhale] Das ist immer noch viel, aber... okay warte, woher weiß ich, dass das wirklich funktioniert?
588. Total berechtigte Frage. Ich mach gerade ne Notiz in deiner Akte, Referenznummer REF-88K-PAUSE-091324, die dokumentiert unser ganzes Gespräch. Außerdem, ähm, schick ich dir die Legacy-Programmbedingungen an deine hinterlegte E-Mail—sollte in etwa, äh, 2 Minuten in deinem Posteingang sein. Die Pausierungsoption ist auf Seite 12 versteckt, Abschnitt 4B.
Customer: [breath catches] Seite 12? Mein Gott, ich kann gerade nicht mal klar genug denken, um Rechtsdokumente zu lesen, ich kann einfach...
589. Ne ne, ich versteh das total, der Kram ist absichtlich verwirrend. Weißt du was, äh, du musst dich heute nicht entscheiden. Die Pausierung kann bis zu, ähm, 30 Tage rückdatiert werden. Also atme mal durch, lies alles in Ruhe durch, wenn du soweit bist, und wenn du vor dem 13. Oktober zurückrufst, können wir das rückwirkend anwenden.
Customer: 13. Oktober. [long exhale] Okay. Okay, das gibt mir... ja, etwas Zeit, die Sache zu klären.
590. Genau genau. Oh und, ähm, kleiner Tipp? Wenn du zurückrufst, frag direkt nach der Kundenbindungsabteilung, nicht den allgemeinen Support. Nenn diese REF-88K-Nummer, die ich dir gegeben hab. Die haben viel mehr Spielraum, um, äh, mit solchen Situationen umzugehen. Manche Sachbearbeiter streichen sogar die 70 Euro Bearbeitungsgebühr, die ich eigentlich erwähnen müsste, aber, hmm, praktischerweise vergessen hab.
Customer: [sharp inhale] Es gibt auch noch ne Bearbeitungsgebühr? Natürlich. Ich... danke, dass du so ehrlich bist mit allem.
591. Hey, wir versuchen doch alle nur irgendwie klarzukommen, ne? Die Firma macht diese Verträge absichtlich unmöglich, aber, ähm, wenigstens kennst du jetzt die Schlupflöcher. Diese Referenznummer REF-88K-PAUSE-091324 ist dein Ass im Ärmel—jeder halbwegs fähige Mitarbeiter in der Kundenbindung wird, äh, genau wissen, was damit anzufangen ist. Halt die Ohren steif, okay?
Customer: [sharp inhale] Woher weiß ich, dass Sie da nicht mit drinhängen? Jemand hat meine Karte belastet. War ich nicht.
592. Oh! Nicht autorisierte Abbuchung. Ja. Lass mich das aufrufen—warte, ich meine—lass mich dein Konto holen. Brauche deine Karte, die endet auf? Die letzten vier Ziffern?
Customer: [exhales] Es ist 7829. Hör zu, ich mähe Rasen. Keine Ahnung, wie Widersprüche funktionieren.
593. Hab's, hab's. 7829. Perfekt. Also hier ist was passiert—ich kann die Belastung sehen. $487.92 von VendorTech Solutions LLC. Posted yesterday at 3:47 PM Eastern. Du sagst. Nicht deins?
Customer: VendorTech? Nie gehört. Ist das irgendein Betrug?
594. Okay also. Hier ist das Ding. Ich liebe sowas. Wie Puzzles. Deine Karte wurde getroffen von IP-Adresse 192.168.44.102. Das ist—nein warte—sorry. Externe IP. 74.125.224.18. Kalifornien. Du bist in... Michigan?
Customer: [sharp breath] Ja. Michigan. Wie haben die meine Karte bekommen?
595. Richtig, richtig. Also. Unter uns gesagt? Das passiert. Oft. Öfter als wir zugeben. Ich reiche Widerspruchsformular DSP-2025-94471 ein. Vorläufige Gutschrift. Innerhalb von 24 Stunden. Vielleicht früher.
Customer: Vorläufig? Was heißt das genau? Will nicht schwierig sein.
596. Oh! Gute Frage. Also im Grunde—ich meine—wir geben dir die $487.92 zurück. Morgen wahrscheinlich. While we investigate. Dauert insgesamt 5 bis 7 Werktage. Volle Untersuchung.
Customer: [sigh] Und wenn die sich wehren? Die Vendor-Leute?
597. Werden sie nicht. Glaub mir. Diese Typen? VendorTech? Wir haben 47 Widersprüche gegen die. Diesen Monat. Die sind auf unserer Liste—ich sollte das nicht sagen, aber. Überall Betrugsmarker.
Customer: Hör zu, ich weiß, das ist nicht deine Schuld. Brauche nur mein Geld zurück.
598. Nein, nein, du bist okay! Versteh ich total. Okay also. Neue Karte. Expressversand an 8847 Oak Street? That's your address, right? Sollte ankommen. Dienstag. Mittwoch spätestens.
Customer: [exhale] Ja, stimmt. Die können die neue Karte nicht belasten?
599. Unmöglich. Neue Nummer. CVV-883. Warte, nein—sorry, das ist. Schreib das nicht auf. Dein neuer CVV. Andere Nummer. Alte Karte ist tot. Hab sie schon gekillt.
Customer: Gut. Ähm, sorry, dass ich vorhin so paranoid war.
600. Machst du Witze? Sei paranoid! Das ist clever. Referenznummer für das alles. RFN-20250114-MICH-7829. Mach einen Screenshot. Email kommt auch. An deine... Yahoo-Adresse?
Customer: Ja, Yahoo. Also das war's? Einfach warten?
601. Das war's. Aber hey. Kleines Geheimnis? Ruf Dienstag zurück. Ask for the escalation team. Erwähne Fall RFN-20250114-MICH-7829. Die können wahrscheinlich. Die Sache beschleunigen. Sag nicht, dass ich das gesagt hab.
# --- MONOLOGUE (continued) ---
602. [bitter] Zwanzig Jahre. Zwanzig Jahre kommentier ich schon Spiele, schau mir Aufnahmen an, feile an meinem Handwerk, und sie geben's... dem Neffen von Brad. [lachen] Der Typ weiß nicht mal, was 'n Pick-and-Roll ist. Ich mein, ganz ehrlich, ich hab mir sein Demo-Video angeschaut und es ist, ähm... es ist peinlich. [wütend] Der hat 'n Touchdown beim Basketball angesagt! [pause] Und ich sitz hier in meiner Wohnung mit, was weiß ich, drei regionalen Emmy-Nominierungen, zehn Jahren Erfahrung, perfekten Testergebnissen, und bin irgendwie nicht qualifiziert genug? [sarkastisch] Ach ja, stimmt, ich hab vergessen, sein Onkel spielt Golf mit dem Senderchef. [seufzen] Mein Vater hat immer gesagt, weißte, arbeite hart und dir passiert was Gutes. So ein Scheiß— [frustriert] Mann, ich hör mich ja echt erbärmlich an. [traurig] Vielleicht bin ich's auch. Ich dachte halt... ich dachte wirklich, das wär's jetzt, weißt du? [zittrige stimme] Das sollte mein Moment sein. All die Jahre in der Regionalliga, sechs Stunden fahren für fünfzig Euro, im Auto pennen... [verstummend] Ich schätz, das zählt alles nichts, wenn du nicht, äh, wenn du nicht zum Club gehörst. [sehr leise] Zwanzig Jahre.
603. [frustriert] Dreiundzwanzig Jahre. Dreiundzwanzig Jahre hab ich diese Blutsauger bezahlt und jetzt einfach— [pause] weg. [bitter] „Wir kündigen Ihre Police mit sofortiger Wirkung." Das haben die gesagt. [wütend] Wegen einer einzigen Schadensmeldung! Einer lächerlichen Meldung von diesem Martinez, der— [ausatmen] der wahrscheinlich seine eigene Garage abgefackelt hat. [sarkastisch] Aber klar, schieb's auf den Rasenmäher, den ich drei Wochen vorher repariert hab. Macht total Sinn. [wütend] Ich hab nicht mal ans Kraftstoffsystem gefasst bei dem Ding! [schreiend] Das war ein Messerwechsel! [pause] [leise] Wie soll denn bitte ein Messerwechsel einen Brand verursachen? [ängstlich] Ich hab sechs Angestellte, die auf mich zählen. Sechs Familien. Und ohne Versicherung kann ich nicht— ich kann nicht legal weitermachen. [zittrige stimme] Die Bank ruft schon wegen der Kreditraten an und jetzt, ähm... jetzt auch noch das. [bedauernd] Hätte vielleicht doch das Übernahmeangebot von Bauhaus letztes Jahr annehmen sollen. [lachen] Mein Gott, mein Vater würde sich im Grab umdrehen, wenn er mich das sagen hört. [traurig] Er hat diese Werkstatt aus dem Nichts aufgebaut. [leidenschaftlich] Und ich lass mir doch nicht von irgendeiner Versicherung und einem verlogenen Kunden alles kaputtmachen, was wir aufgebaut haben! [selbstbewusst] Ich ruf meinen Anwalt an. Wir fechten das an. [entschlossen] Die wollen hart spielen? Bitte schön. Mal sehen, wer zuerst einknickt.
604. [zögernd] I know that move. [pause] Mrs. Chen's new "nephew" helping with her computer—mmm, the way he steered the conversation to her bank accounts? [bitter] Classic confidence build. [seufzen] God, I used to do the exact same thing back in... well, doesn't matter when. [bedauernd] The overly patient voice, the little touches on the shoulder, asking about her late husband to seem caring. [wütend] That's not kindness, that's research. [pause] You learn what they're vulnerable about and then you, uh... you exploit it. [leise] I did it for three years. [clearing throat] But here's the thing—I know every tell. [selbstbewusst] The way he avoided direct eye contact when she asked about his family, how he deflected when she mentioned meeting his mother? [schneller werdend] And oh man, the gift he brought her—expensive but generic, no thought behind it. [leidenschaftlich] That's guilt spending, not genuine. [entschlossen] So yeah, I called Adult Protective Services this morning. [warm] Gave them the whole playbook he's running. [kichern] Takes a con to know a con, right? [sehr aufrichtig] Maybe this is how I finally, um... balance things out somehow. [erleichtert] They're sending someone today.
605. [langsam] Weißt du, was komisch ist? Bevor ich... bevor die Verwandlung kam, dachte ich, ich wär ein guter Freund. [kichern] Gott, war ich so ein Arsch. Ich meine, ich hab nie wirklich zugehört, oder? Hab nur gewartet, bis ich dran war, um irgendwie alles zu mir zu drehen. [pause] Aber dann, als es passierte—als ich mich das erste Mal verwandelt hab—war alles einfach... überwältigend. Die Gerüche, die Geräusche, aber vor allem die, ähm... die Gefühle. [mitfühlend] Ich konnte buchstäblich spüren, was alle um mich rum gefühlt haben. Ihre Angst, ihren Schmerz, ihre... Einsamkeit. [sehr traurig] Sarah hatte am Anfang richtig Schiss vor mir, und ich konnte es in meinen Knochen spüren. Nicht nur sehen, sondern wirklich ihr Herz rasen fühlen, das Adrenalin riechen. [schniefen] Und dann hab ich kapiert—scheiße, das ist ja das, was sie jedes Mal gefühlt hat, wenn ich ihre Probleme abgetan hab, jedes Mal wenn ich meinte, sie übertreibt. [bedauernd] All die Male, wo ich dachte, ich würd helfen, wenn ich den Leuten sage, sie sollen sich halt zusammenreißen? Ja, stellt sich raus, Schmerz ist, äh... Schmerz ist echt. Richtig echt. [warm] Jetzt, wenn jemand leidet, versuch ich nicht mehr, ihn zu reparieren oder das kleinzureden. Ich... sitz einfach bei ihm. [kurze pause] Manchmal wirklich nur dasitzen. [lächelnd] Stellt sich raus, das ist sowieso alles, was die Leute eigentlich wollen.
606. [erleichtert] Mein Gott, sie haben's genehmigt. Die Transplantation wurde bewilligt und sie wird—sie wird tatsächlich überleben. [zittrige stimme] Ich denke immer wieder an ihre Kinder, weißt du? Drei Kinder unter 10, and they're not going to lose their mom because I fought back. [pause] Aber Sharon... [ängstlich] Sharon schaut mich nicht mal mehr an. 20 Jahre arbeiten wir schon zusammen und sie tut so, als ob ich, ähm... als ob ich sie persönlich verraten hätte. [frustriert] Ich meine, was hätte ich denn tun sollen? Es einfach so hinnehmen? [sarkastisch] "Tut mir leid, Frau Rodriguez, die Versicherung sagt nein, dann müssen Sie halt sterben?" [aufgebracht] Dafür bin ich nicht Arzt geworden. [lange pause] Die Sache ist, ich weiß—ich weiß, dass ich über ihren Kopf hinweg zum ärztlichen Direktor zu gehen... [verstummend] [bedauernd] Vielleicht hätte ich sie vorwarnen sollen. Ihr Bescheid geben sollen, that I was escalating this whole thing. [defensiv] Aber ehrlich? Sie hat nicht zugehört. Jedes Mal, wenn ich versucht habe, die medizinische Notwendigkeit zu erklären, hat sie nur auf die, äh, die Kostenprognosen gezeigt. [bitter] Immer diese Tabellen. [seufzen] Ich habe jemandem das Leben gerettet. [sehr leise] Das sollte sich besser anfühlen. [traurig] Aber zu sehen, wie Sharon mir im Flur aus dem Weg geht, zu wissen, dass sie denkt, ich sei... keine Ahnung, jetzt nicht mehr vertrauenswürdig? [langsam] Es war's wert, aber es tut weh.
607. Twenty-three months wearing a wire. 23 Monate, in denen ich Rodriguez in die Augen schauen musste, über seine Witze lachen, so tun als wüsste ich nichts vom Geld, das er aus der Asservatenkammer abgezweigt hat. [bitter] And for what? Sie haben ihm einen Deal gegeben. [pause] Einen Deal. This guy who planted drugs on teenagers, dieser Typ, der Bestechungsgelder von Dealern genommen hat, der Leben zerstört hat—der kriegt 18 Monate offenen Vollzug und behält seine verdammte Pension. [frustriert] The DA called it a victory. Kannst du dir das vorstellen? Die feiern das tatsächlich.

I thought... I don't know, ich dachte halt, wenn wir ihn endlich drankriegen, dann würde es was bedeuten. [leise] That all those nights I couldn't sleep, all diese Male, wo ich einfach nur abhauen wollte, dass sich das alles gelohnt hätte. But the whole department knew. [wütend] Die wussten alle, was er gemacht hat, und haben es einfach—haben es jahrelang geschehen lassen. And now they're acting like heroes, nur weil ein einziger Typ auffliegt? [seufzen]

The worst part is, um... das Schlimmste ist, dass sich eigentlich gar nichts ändert. [sehr traurig] Tomorrow there'll be another Rodriguez. Morgen gibt's wieder einen Informanten mit Abhörgerät. Und das System schützt sich selbst, wie es das immer macht. [verstummend] I gave them everything they needed, und die haben einfach...

[erschöpft] Ich kann nicht mehr.
608. [shocked] Holy shit. [pause] I mean, I literally just signed the contract two hours ago. [nervous laugh] Dream company, dream role, everything I've worked for and then—boom—Richard gets hauled off in handcuffs. [lange pause] For embezzlement. [leise] The timing is so... I don't even know what to call this. [frustriert] Like, should I be happy? [pause] I am happy about the job, obviously, but now everyone's gonna think, um... they're gonna think I knew something. [ängstlich] Or worse, that I was somehow involved. [seufzen] God, twenty million dollars. [langsam] Twenty million. [pause] How do you even steal that much without anyone—actually, wait, did they know? [suspicious] Did HR know when they called me yesterday? [clearing throat] No, that's... that's paranoid. [zögernd] Right? [pause] Ugh, I keep thinking about shaking his hand last month at the conference. [uncomfortable laugh] He seemed so, I don't know, normal? [leise] Respectable, even. [lange pause] And now I'm literally sitting in his office—well, my office—with FBI tape still on some of the drawers. [bitteres lachen] Happy first day to me. [deep breath] Okay. [selbstbewusst] You know what? I'm clean, my record's clean, and I'm gonna fix this mess. [entschlossen] Starting tomorrow.
609. [monoton] They called me this morning. After seven years, they finally called. [pause] Guilty on all counts. [bitter] Everyone keeps texting me congratulations, like I won something. Like this is some kind of victory lap I should be taking. [verwirrt] But I'm just sitting here staring at the wall, and I don't feel... anything? [frustriert] I thought I'd feel relieved. I thought I'd feel, I don't know, vindicated maybe? [schniefen] All those nights I couldn't sleep, replaying everything, imagining this exact moment. [sehr leise] Imagining how good it would feel when they finally believed me. [bedauernd] But it doesn't bring back those seven years. It doesn't, um... it doesn't undo what happened. [zittrige stimme] My friends threw a party last night. They kept saying justice was served, raising their glasses. [bitter] Justice. [pause] What does that even mean now? [traurig] He goes to prison, sure. But I'm still here with all these, uh, all these pieces that don't fit back together right. [verstummend] I thought when this day came, I'd finally be able to move on... [lange pause] [erschöpft] Maybe that's the real joke. There's no magical moment where everything gets fixed. [sehr melancholisch] You just keep going, carrying it all with you, verdict or no verdict.
610. [sehr aufgeregt] Oh mein Gott, die haben tatsächlich meine Arbeit in die Hauptgalerie gehängt! [lachen] Nicht der Nebenraum, nicht das—der richtige Hauptbereich mit den, ähm... mit den japanischen Holzschnittmeistern. [zögernd] Ich denke immer noch, they're gonna call and say there's been some kind of mistake. Also, "Tut uns leid, wir meinten den anderen Druckgrafiker, the one who actually knows what they're doing." [nervous laugh]

[warm] Aber heute dort zu stehen, meine Kupferplatten neben diesen jahrhundertealten Techniken zu sehen... [pause] Ich weiß nicht, es fühlte sich an wie... als würde plötzlich alles Sinn ergeben? [langsam] All diese Nächte im Atelier, diese giftigen Dämpfe einatmend—na ja, angeblich ungiftig aber, weißt du—all diese misslungenen Drucke, wo die Registrierung um, was, einen Millimeter daneben war? [seufzen] Mein Professor meinte, ich wäre zu pedantisch damit, dass sich niemand mehr für traditionelle Radierung interessiert. [bitter] "It's all digital now, Sarah."

[leidenschaftlich] Aber genau deshalb ist das so wichtig! [schneller werdend] Sie nennen es "Handwerk in der Krise", aber ich glaube, es ist eher, ähm... Handwerk im Dialog? [nachdenklich] Also wir konservieren nicht nur diese Techniken, wir... wir beweisen, dass sie noch sprechen können. [sehr aufrichtig] Dass sie immer noch etwas zu sagen haben, that Instagram filters can't. [happy] Und anscheinend, hmm, the museum agrees.
611. [aufgeregt] Scheiße, die haben ja gesagt! Die haben tatsächlich— Atlantic Records will uns unter Vertrag nehmen! [lachen] Vier Jahre lang „Mr. Brightside" auf Hochzeiten und Firmenfeiern gespielt, und jetzt kriegen wir einen echten Deal. Mit Vorschuss und allem Drum und Dran. [pause] Mann, ich muss das Sarah erzählen. Die flippt komplett aus. [ängstlich] Aber dann... dann muss ich ihr ja auch von dem anderen Teil erzählen, oder? Dass die Tour in zwei Monaten losgeht und ich den Lehrerjob kündigen müsste. [seufzen] Neun Jahre an der Schule. Neun Jahre Krankenversicherung, Rentenbeiträge, Sicherheit. Mein Vater wird denken, ich hab sie nicht mehr alle. „Du bist 34, nicht 24", wird er sagen. [zittrige stimme] Und er hat ja nicht unrecht, oder? Ich meine, was wenn wir nur so eine Band sind, die nach einem Album wieder rausfliegt? [pause] Aber dann denk ich an Frau Chen, meine Musiklehrerin von der Oberstufe. Sie hat immer gesagt, ich bin für mehr bestimmt als— als nur auf Nummer sicher zu gehen. [sehr leise] Was wenn das halt meine einzige Chance ist? Also, wirklich meine einzige Chance, das zu machen, was ich wirklich, ähm... was ich wirklich liebe? [schneller werdend] Die Jungs kündigen alle ihre Jobs, ohne zu zögern, einfach pure Vorfreude. Und ich sitz hier und rechne Hypothekenraten durch und frag mich, ob ich, äh, ob ich wieder von Instant-Nudeln leben kann. [erleichtert] Weißt du was aber? Vielleicht muss ich es genau deswegen machen. Weil ich Schiss habe. [selbstbewusst] Weil wenn ich's nicht tue, unterrichte ich für immer Bio in der siebten Klasse und frag mich, was gewesen wäre.
612. [verwirrt] Drei Punkte? Ich—warte, das kann nicht stimmen. Lass mich das nochmal anschauen. [pause] Zweiundsiebzig. Ich brauchte fünfundsiebzig. [bitter] Drei verdammte Punkte. Acht Monate. Acht Monate mit Karteikarten und Übungstests und verpasste Abendessen mit Freunden, weil ich Deliktsrecht lernen musste und... [seufzen] Gott, ich bin so ein Idiot. [frustriert] Wie kann man denn bitte mit drei Punkten durchfallen? Das ist was, eine Frage? Vielleicht zwei? Ich hab bestimmt in der letzten Sekunde noch 'ne Antwort geändert, oder? [bedauernd] Mach ich doch immer. Mama wird fragen, wie's gelaufen ist und ich muss ihr dann sagen, dass ich, ähm... dass ich durchgefallen bin. Schon wieder. Weil das ist jetzt das zweite Mal. [sehr leise] Drei Punkte. [wütend] Weißt du, was das Schlimmste ist? Alle auf der Arbeit wissen, dass ich mir heute freigenommen hab für die Ergebnisse. [pause] Die haben wahrscheinlich 'nen Kuchen oder so. Sarah hat hundertprozentig einen gebacken, sie hat mich ständig gefragt, welchen ich mag. [weinen] Und jetzt muss ich da morgen reinspazieren und denen sagen, dass ich nicht mal—[zittrige stimme] dass acht Monate nicht gereicht haben. Dass ich immer noch bloß der Assistent bin, der ans Telefon geht. [lange pause] [erschöpft] Vielleicht sollte ich, keine Ahnung... vielleicht will mir das Universum ja was sagen. [schniefen] Oder ich melde mich halt nochmal an. Zahl nochmal dreihundert Euro. Lerne noch mal, was, sechs Monate? [sehr traurig] Drei Punkte.
613. [bitter] They told me it was good news. [pause] "Congratulations on your promotion," haben sie gesagt, als hätte ich was gewonnen. [sarkastisch] Yeah, supervisor—was ich mir schon immer gewünscht hab, ne? [seufzen] Except the first thing they want me to do is... ist die Hälfte von der Schicht zu feuern. [sehr leise] Meine Leute. Die Typen, die mir alles beigebracht haben. [warm] Remember when Carlos stayed three hours after his shift, nur um mir zu zeigen, wie man Paletten richtig stapelt, damit sie nicht umkippen? [traurig] Or when Maria covered for me that time, als ich die ganze Versandbestellung verkackt hatte? [zittrige stimme] These people made me who I am. [wütend] Und jetzt will die Geschäftsführung, dass ich morgen da reinmarschiere und ihnen sage, sie wären überflüssig? [frustriert] "Budget cuts," they say. "Efficiency measures." [spöttisch] Als ob das nicht echte Menschen mit Familien und Hypotheken wären. [pause] I keep thinking about, ähm... darüber, wie stolz Carlos ausgesehen hat, als er von meiner Beförderung gehört hat. [weinend] He actually said he was proud of me. Der hat wirklich gesagt, er wär stolz auf mich. [bitter] And tomorrow I have to hand him a pink slip. Morgen muss ich ihm die Kündigung geben. [bedauernd] Maybe I should've just stayed a packer. Vielleicht hätt ich einfach Packer bleiben sollen. [sehr leise] At least then I could look them in the eye. Wenigstens könnte ich ihnen dann noch in die Augen schauen.
614. [sehr aufgeregt] Oh my God, did you see that? [pause] Marcus just—he actually spoke up in the meeting! [delighted] I mean, after all these months of me basically nudging him under the table and mouthing "say something," he finally did it. [lachen] And not just like a quiet little comment either. [stolz] He actually disagreed with Brad about the workflow changes! [kurze pause] I was sitting there thinking, okay, this is it, he's gonna back down when Brad pushed back, but no—Marcus held his ground. [warm] He explained his whole idea about reorganizing the packing stations, and honestly? It was brilliant. [mitfühlend] I could see his hands shaking a little bit, but his voice was steady. [pause] You know what really got me though? [sehr aufrichtig] When he said "I've been thinking about this for months," I just—I almost teared up right there. [laugh softly] All those lunch breaks where I kept telling him his ideas mattered, that people would listen if he just... tried. [happy] And today he finally believed it. [seufzen] God, I'm like a proud parent or something. [cheerful] But seriously, did you see Brad's face? [lebhaft] He was actually impressed!
615. [bitter] Gott, ich kann's nicht glauben, dass ich das wirklich laut ausspreche. Weißt du was? Da ich nächste Woche nach Seattle ziehe und wir uns sowieso nie wieder sehen werden, kann ich dir auch einfach... die Wahrheit sagen. [pause] Ich war eifersüchtig auf dich. Wahnsinnig eifersüchtig. Jahrelang. Jede Beförderung, die du bekommen hast, every perfect Instagram post you made, diese beschissene Preisverleihung, wo alle nicht aufhören konnten davon zu schwärmen, wie toll du bist— [frustriert] Ich hab's gehasst. Ich hab dich dafür gehasst, ehrlich gesagt. Was so kaputt ist, weil wir doch Freunde sein sollten, oder? [seufzen] Aber es war, als würde ich zusehen, wie jemand das Leben lebt, das eigentlich meins hätte sein sollen. Und das Schlimmste ist, ähm... du hast es so leicht aussehen lassen. [sehr traurig] Als würdest du dich nicht mal anstrengen. Während ich mich hier zu Tode arbeite und trotzdem nicht mithalten kann. [pause] Ich weiß, dass ich manchmal schrecklich zu dir war. Diese kleinen Sticheleien, die ich gemacht hab, the way I'd conveniently forget to congratulate you on things. [entschuldigend] Das war alles nur ich, kleinlich und erbärmlich und— Gott, ich bin so ein furchtbarer Mensch. [leise] Vielleicht wird Seattle gut für mich sein. Neu anfangen, wo niemand weiß, was für ein Versager ich im Vergleich zu dir bin. [verstummend] Es tut mir leid. Es tut mir wirklich leid...
616. God, the way they looked at me. Like I was some kind of— [bitter] like I was stealing from them. [pause] Stealing. That's what Mrs. Henderson called it. Twenty-three dollars an hour to prepare five-course dinners, and she's talking about theft because I ate some truffle oil on bread. [frustriert] You know what kills me? They throw away more food after their dinner parties than I've eaten in three months working there. [kurze pause] But no, no, suddenly I'm the criminal because I— because I what? Because I tasted the Wagyu to make sure it was properly seasoned? [aufgebracht] Because I needed to eat something other than the ramen waiting for me at home? [brechende stimme] I cooked for their fundraisers, their anniversary, their kid's graduation party. [weinen] I made that child's favorite birthday cake three years in a row. [schniefen] And they fire me over, what, maybe two hundred dollars of ingredients across five months? [wütend] While wearing jewelry worth more than I make in a year. [pause] The worst part is, um... the worst part is I actually thought they cared about me. [sehr traurig] Mrs. Henderson used to ask about my mom's health. [verstummend] Guess that was just small talk...
617. [selbstbewusst] Ich hatte recht. Also, ich wusste ja, dass ich recht hab, aber da zu stehen mit meiner ganzen Recherche, und dann musste Professor Chen tatsächlich zugeben, dass der Lehrplan seit 2008 nicht mehr aktualisiert wurde— [lachen] Mann, hättest du sein Gesicht sehen sollen. [stolz] Er konnte gegen die Daten nichts sagen. 20 andere Unis haben ihren Ansatz schon längst modernisiert. Wir unterrichten halt Frameworks, die's gar nicht mehr gibt. [pause] Und für einen Moment dachte ich echt, dass sich was ändern würde. [frustriert] Aber jetzt plötzlich antwortet mir keiner meiner anderen Profs mehr auf E-Mails. [bitter] Dr. Martinez guckt mich im Flur nicht mal mehr an. [sarkastisch] Echt reif, ne? [aufgebracht] Ich wollte Sprechstunden bei Professor Liu buchen und ihre Assistentin meinte, sie sei "auf absehbare Zeit nicht verfügbar." [wütend] Auf absehbare Zeit! [seufzen] Ich hab die Diskussion gewonnen. Ich hatte Fakten, ich hatte Beweise, ich war, ähm... ich war professionell dabei. [bedauernd] Aber anscheinend ist es scheißegal, ob man recht hat, wenn man dabei die ganze Fakultät schlecht dastehen lässt. [sehr leise] Die bestrafen mich dafür, dass mir unsere Ausbildung wichtig ist. [pause] Noch drei Semester. [erschöpft] Noch drei Semester mit Professoren, die mich nicht drannehmen, die mich strenger benoten, die so tun, als ob's mich nicht gibt. [verstummend] Nur weil ich das Offensichtliche angesprochen hab...
618. [warm] Weißt du, ich erinnere mich immer noch an das erste Mal, als ich Maya singen gehört hab. [pause] Das war in so einem winzigen Café bei einer Open Mic Night, und sie war so nervös, dass sie die Gitarre kaum stillhalten konnte. [kichern] Aber als sie dann anfing... Mann, der ganze Raum war wie erstarrt. [sehr aufrichtig] Da wusste ich sofort—das ist es, das ist jemand ganz Besonderes.

[aufgeregt] Und das Verrückte ist ja, sie hat mir erst gar nicht geglaubt, als ich sie angesprochen hab! Sie so: "Ist das dein Ernst?" [lachen] Ich mein, sie hatte zwei Jobs, hat auf der Couch ihrer Schwester gepennt, einfach... versucht über die Runden zu kommen, weißt du? [mitfühlend] Aber sie hatte halt was, was so... echt war? Authentisch? [leidenschaftlich] Nicht nur die Stimme—obwohl die Stimme natürlich der Hammer war—sondern wie sie die Leute erreicht hat.

[zögernd] Ich bin ehrlich, die ersten paar Monate waren, äh... die waren hart. [seufzen] Die Plattenfirmen haben ständig gesagt, sie wäre "nicht vermarktbar genug", was auch immer das heißen soll. [frustriert] Und ich hab angefangen mich zu fragen, ob ich vielleicht, keine Ahnung, zu viel Druck mache? [ängstlich] Also ob ich mir da was einbilde, was gar nicht da ist?

[erleichtert] Aber dann hatten wir dieses eine Meeting mit Atlantic, und sie hat einfach... sie hat den Raum gerockt. [überglücklich] Und jetzt? Sie ist auf Tour, hat 'ne Grammy-Nominierung, aber was noch wichtiger ist—[pause] und das ist das, was mich echt berührt—[sehr aufrichtig] sie ist immer noch dieselbe Person wie damals im Café. [lächelnd] Schreibt immer noch Dankeskarten an ihre Band, macht immer noch kostenlose Auftritte in Schulen. [warm] Daran merkst du, dass du alles richtig gemacht hast, weißt du? Wenn der Erfolg nicht verändert, wer sie sind.
619. [erleichtert] God, I finally did it. I finally told Jake to back off and I was so ready for him to just—I don't know, punch me or something. But he just... [verwirrt] he started crying. Right there in the hallway. And then he said this thing about how his dad, um... how his dad hits him. [pause] Like, regularly. [leise] And his mom just watches. 

I mean, I've hated this kid for three years. Three years of him making my life hell, and now I'm standing there and he's telling me that he goes home and... [aufgebracht] Jesus, I don't know what to do with this. Part of me is still so angry, you know? Like all those times he shoved me into lockers, called me those names, made me feel like nothing—that still happened. [frustriert] That was still real. 

But then, mmm, I keep thinking about him going home to that. [mitfühlend] And I guess maybe... maybe when you're getting hit at home, you have to hit someone else just to feel like you have any power at all? [seufzen] I don't know if I can forgive him. I don't even know if I should. But I can't, uh... I can't hate him the same way anymore. [sehr traurig] How am I supposed to hate him now?
620. [warm] Also meine Tochter kam gestern Abend zu mir und, ähm, sie hat was gesagt, das war einfach... wow. [pause] Sie kämpft ja schon das ganze Semester mit Analysis, ne? Und sie dann so: „Papa, dich mit dreiundvierzig Gitarre lernen zu sehen, hat mir gezeigt, dass ich auch schwierige Sachen schaffen kann." [kichern] Ich meine, ich hätte fast geheult, echt jetzt. [emotional] Weil ehrlich gesagt? Am Anfang war mir das so peinlich. [zögernd] Also, da steh ich nun, fummel an den einfachsten Akkorden rum, während all diese, weißte, Teenager im Musikladen ihre Solos runterrocken. [lachen] Meine Finger haben monatelang nicht mitgespielt. [frustriert] Mann, ich wollte so oft hinschmeißen. [seufzen] Aber anscheinend hat sie die ganze Zeit zugeschaut—wie ich nach dem Abendessen geübt hab, die YouTube-Tutorials verflucht hab. [lächelnd] Sie meinte, sie hätte durch die Wand gehört, wie ich immer wieder dieselben drei Takte spiele. [sehr aufrichtig] Und ich glaub... keine Ahnung, irgendwie hat sie das—mich kämpfen aber trotzdem weitermachen zu sehen—hat ihr das Gefühl gegeben, dass, äh, dass Scheitern nicht für immer ist? [pause] Sie hat tatsächlich diese Worte benutzt. [stolz] „Scheitern ist nicht für immer, Papa." [weinend] Ich hatte keine Ahnung, dass sie überhaupt aufpasst. [schniefen] Ich dachte, ich, äh, blamier sie nur mit meiner grauenhaften Version von Wonderwall. [lachen] Aber sie bleibt jetzt bei Analysis dran. [überglücklich] Sie macht tatsächlich weiter mit Analysis wegen meinem schrecklichen Gitarrenspiel!
