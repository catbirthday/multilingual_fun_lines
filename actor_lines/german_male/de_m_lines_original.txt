Customer: Um, I've been your customer for, uh, six years. Six. Years. And now my vendor payment's just... gone?
1. Oh oh oh, okay so, um, let me just—wait, actually—let me pull up your account here real quick and, uh, basically we're gonna figure this out together, alright? So I'm seeing account number BUS-44729-QX here, is that, um, is that the right one for your bakery?
Customer: Yeah. Been up since 4am. Can't... can't deal with this right now.
2. Oooh, bakery owner, yeah so like, between you and me? I totally get it—my sister runs a café and she's she's always exhausted. So, um, I'm looking at transaction TXN-892341-K and it shows, uh, initiated yesterday at 3:47pm but then there's this weird—hmm—okay so basically there's like a hold code HC-7749 that shouldn't be there.
Customer: A hold? I mean, uh, what kind of hold? That's rent money. Um, are you sure it's not just...
3. Right right, no I see exactly what happened—so the the payment processor flagged it because, um, and this is kinda ridiculous but, uh, the amount was like $4,444.44 and their system thought it was, er, suspicious? Which is—I mean—that's silly but reference number REF-20847-AAB shows it got caught in their, um, their fraud filter.
Customer: Fraud? Um, I've paid that exact amount for, uh, three months now. Every month. So...
4. Exactly!
Customer: So basically, um, when's this gonna be fixed? Because, uh, I can't... the vendor needs this today or...
5. Okay so—and don't don't worry, we're gonna fix this—um, between you and me? I can bypass their silly filter. So basically I'm putting in override code OVR-55821-MNX right now and, uh, marking this vendor VND-3847 as pre-approved so like, this won't happen again next month, you know?
Customer: You can do that?
6. Well well well, technically I need supervisor approval but, um, looking at your history here—transaction log TL-98234 shows, uh, perfect payments for six years straight so, er, yeah I'm just gonna—I'm gonna push this through. The payment should should release in, hmm, about fifteen minutes with confirmation PCF-77439-D.
Customer: Um, fifteen minutes? Are you, uh, are you absolutely sure? Because if this doesn't...
7. Yep yep, absolutely sure, and and actually? I'm also gonna—hold on—I'm gonna add priority flag PF-2288 which means, um, if anything goes wrong, which it won't, but if it does, you'd get an instant callback from from our escalation team.
Customer: I just, um... after six years of perfect payments, this is just...
8. No no, you're absolutely right to be frustrated! Like, the system flagging $4,444.44 as suspicious when, uh, when I can literally see here in your vendor history VH-66290-K that it's the same payment every single month? That's on us, not you.
Customer: Um, so you're sure? Fifteen minutes? Because, uh, I've got dough proofing and I can't just...
9. Promise promise promise. So, um, I've set up notification alert NA-88451-QQZ to ping your phone the the second it goes through, and, uh, between you and me? I put a note in vendor file VF-3847 that basically says "priority customer - no holds ever" so, er, my supervisor might not love that but, you know, six years of loyalty means something.
Customer: That's... okay. Um, thank you. Really. I just, uh, I need sleep and...
10. Hey so, um, one more thing—I'm also adding courtesy credit CC-9982-XV for for the inconvenience, it's not much but, uh, it'll show up as a $25 credit next billing cycle, and and honestly? After being up since 4am dealing with our mistake, you deserve way more than that but, er, that's the max I can do without without getting in trouble. You should get confirmation text CT-44519 in about, hmm, two minutes showing everything's processing.
Customer: Um, I've been a customer for, uh, twelve years and I'm looking at my account and there's... what's the word... duplicate charges?
11. Oh, I absolutely understand your concern, and um, thank you for being such a loyal customer with us. Let me, uh, pull up your account here... what's the word... your member number ends in 4782, right? So I'm seeing some transactions here and, hmm, I want to make sure we get this sorted out for you right away.
Customer: Yes! Um, like, I bought gas yesterday and it's, uh, it's showing twice!
12. Okay, so um, I'm looking at transaction ID TXN-892341-GS here, and, uh, this is actually a really common thing that confuses folks. What you're seeing is... hmm, one is what we call a pending transaction and the other is the, um, posted transaction, and they'll sort of...
Customer: But that's, uh, that's theft! I mean, um, how is that even legal?
13. Oh no no, I completely understand why it looks that way, and um, you're absolutely not being charged twice, I promise. So what happens is, uh, when you swipe your card at the gas station, they put a... what's the word... a temporary hold for like $100 or $125, that's the pending one with reference PND-8923-A, and then the actual amount you pumped...
Customer: Um, wait, so like, they're not... uh... I'm not actually paying twice?
14. Exactly, exactly.
Customer: Oh god, I'm so, um, I feel so stupid, I just, uh, I called my bank first and...
15. Oh please don't feel that way at all! Honestly, um, this is probably the most common question we get, and the way it displays in the app is, uh, really confusing. I've actually, hmm, submitted feedback about this myself because, um, at least three or four people call about this every single day.
Customer: Really? So it's, um, it's not just me being, uh, financially illiterate?
16. Not at all, not even close! Um, so here's what I can do for you - I can, uh, send you a little guide we have, document number DOC-7823-EDU, that explains the whole, um, pending versus posted thing with some examples. And honestly? My own mom called me about this exact same thing last month...
Customer: Um, that would be, uh, really helpful actually, I mean, if it's not too much trouble...
17. No trouble whatsoever! I'm, um, already getting that queued up to your email on file. And, uh, just so you know for future reference, those pending charges usually drop off in, hmm, 2-3 business days, sometimes faster depending on the merchant.
Customer: Okay so, um, I should just, uh, ignore the pending ones then?
18. Well, um, I wouldn't say completely ignore them, because they do, uh, affect your available balance temporarily. So like, if you have $500 in your account and there's a $100 pending charge, you can really only spend, hmm, $400 until it clears. That's where people sometimes get caught...
Customer: Oh! Um, oh that makes, uh, so much more sense now, like why my balance looked weird.
19. Right? Yeah, it's um, it's one of those banking things that really should be explained better. Your actual balance in account ending 4782 is, uh, let me see here... $1,247.82, but your available balance is showing, hmm, $1,122.82 because of that pending gas charge.
Customer: I'm so sorry for, um, for getting all, uh, worked up about this, you've been really... what's the word... patient.
20. Oh my goodness, please, you have nothing to apologize for! Um, this is exactly what I'm here for, and honestly, you've been lovely to talk with. Is there, uh, anything else about your account or those transactions that I can help clarify? I've got your case number saved as CSE-9923-XM if you need to reference this call later...
Customer: Um, I just... I got this letter and, uh, my credit limit is... er, it's cut? I don't... I can't...
21. Right right. So I can pull that up—let me just—actually your account number ending in 4782, I see the adjustment here from October 15th.
Customer: But I, um, I pay on time. Every month. So, like, why would they just...
22. So the thing is—wait, let me—okay so basically, um, the system flagged account ACT-4782-MK for, uh, what we call a periodic review, and um, based on the credit report pull CRB-892341, there were some changes.
Customer: Changes? What changes? I haven't done anything.
23. I understand, and um, so like, the report shows—er, let me be specific here—three new, uh, credit inquiries in September and, um, your utilization across all cards jumped to, uh, 78%.
Customer: Oh. Um. Yeah. So basically my car just... and then the, uh, the medical bills and I just... I can't...
24. Got it.
Customer: I'm just, um, trying so hard to keep up and, er, now this? Like, how am I supposed to, um, manage when they take away the cushion?
25. I know this is—I mean, um, I'm really sorry about—actually let me, uh, look at what options—so your new limit in system code LMT-4782-R2 is $3,000, down from, er, $8,000.
Customer: Three thousand. That's... that's less than I owe.
26. Right, so you're at $4,200 currently, which means—and I know this isn't ideal—but that puts you overlimit by $1,200.
Customer: Oh god. Um. So like, what happens now? Do I, uh, have to pay that immediately? Because I just... I literally can't...
27. No no, you don't—I mean, we're not demanding immediate payment. The system note SNT-445692 shows you have until your next statement date, November 22nd, to bring it under.
Customer: Okay. Okay so that's... let me think here... that's something.
28. And actually—um, wait, I'm seeing—so there's a, uh, hardship program code HRD-789-TEMP that I could, er, potentially apply if you're, um, experiencing temporary financial difficulty?
Customer: Really? Oh my god, um, yes, that would be—I mean, er, you're actually helping? Like, really helping?
29. Absolutely.
Customer: Thank you. Seriously. Everyone else just... but you're actually listening.
30. So I've added note CSN-445693-H to start that process. You'll get an email within 24 hours with the hardship application, and once approved, we can work on more manageable terms.
Customer: Um, so okay, I just got this charge and, hmm, let me see here... it's for ninety-seven dollars? And I definitely didn't authorize this, I mean...
31. Oh hey there! Um, let me just, uh—sorry, let me pull that up. Account number ACS-4492-BN7. Okay. So. Between you and me? These auto-renewals are, um, kind of sneaky.
Customer: Right? That's what I thought! Um, so like, I signed up for the free trial last year, and then I forgot about it, but then nothing happened for months so...
32. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So what I'm seeing here is, uh, transaction TXN-885421-QW. It's—wait no, sorry—that's the wrong one. Here we go. TXN-885423-QW. Looks like it, um, it kind of hibernated? Then reactivated.
Customer: Hibernated? What does that even mean? How do I know this isn't some kind of, um... I mean, are you sure this is even real?
33. Totally get it. I mean, uh, honestly? I'd probably think the same thing. Let me, er, let me show you something cool though. Reference code REF-2234-XKL9. That's your original signup. See the gap?
Customer: Um, yeah, so there's like eight months where nothing... hmm, and then suddenly BAM, they charge me?
34. Right right. Exactly.
Customer: But that doesn't make any sense! Let me see here... um, wouldn't they have to notify me or something before just...
35. So, um, technically—and I'm kind of, uh, not supposed to say this—but they did send an email to, er, let me check... is it still the hotmail address? MSG-ID-7789-PLK2? But, um, between us? Those emails are, uh, pretty easy to miss.
Customer: Hotmail? Oh god, I haven't checked that in, um... hmm, maybe that's where all the... but still, that seems really shady, you know?
36. Oh absolutely. Like, um, super shady. Here's what I'm gonna do though. I'm, uh—I mean, I think I can—let me just... okay. Refund authorization RFD-9982-MNX1. Full amount. Plus, um, kind of throwing in next month free if you want to keep it?
Customer: Wait, really? Um, so you're just gonna... but hmm, what if this happens again though?
37. So here's the, um, here's the insider trick. Ready? I'm putting a note—NOTE-4451-BVX9—that says, uh, "manual renewal only." That means it literally, er, it can't charge you unless you physically call us.
Customer: Okay but, um, let me think... how do I know that note will actually stick? What if someone else just...
38. Ah. Good question. Um, so I'm actually, uh, I'm gonna send you confirmation code CNF-8827-TTR3. Screenshot that. If anyone ever, um, tries anything? That's like your, uh, your get-out-of-jail-free card. That code means I personally guaranteed it.
Customer: Um, okay so... hmm, you seem actually helpful, not like the last person who just kept saying "policy this" and...
39. Ugh, yeah. Some reps are, um, they're really by-the-book. But like, er, customer loyalty code CLY-3398-QQZ1? That's going on your account too. That basically means you get, uh, you get the cool rep treatment from now on.
Customer: Wow, um, okay! So the refund will show up when? And I should screenshot that code you said...?
40. So, um, refund hits in, uh, three to five days. Processing number PRC-6671-AAL2. And yeah! Screenshot, er, screenshot everything. Oh and, um, one more thing? Check your email. Not the hotmail. I'm sending you, uh, my direct extension. Just in case.
Customer: Um, so I got this... uh, charge? From, um, "Digital Commerce Solutions" but I don't... I mean, what even is...
41. Oh okay, I can definitely help you figure that out, let me just pull up your account here real quick—what's the amount showing on that charge?
Customer: It's, uh, forty-two fifty. Wait. No. Forty-seven fifty.
42. Alright so, um, forty-seven fifty, and I'm seeing here—hmm, that's interesting actually—so sometimes, uh, companies process payments under their sort of, um, corporate entity name which might be different from what you know them as, let me check transaction ID TXN-892445-QR7 here.
Customer: Corporate... um, entity? So it's not... uh, I didn't buy anything from, er, Digital whatever it was...
43. Right right, so like, um, think of it this way—you know how, uh, sometimes McDonald's might show up as like "MCD Franchise 4521" or something? It's kinda the same thing, um, let me just search this merchant ID MER-7783-DCS and see what they actually...
Customer: Oh! Like my gym shows up as... something weird...
44. Exactly! Yes! So, um, Digital Commerce Solutions—that's weird though because usually I can find these pretty quick—uh, let me try a different lookup, maybe reference number REF-20241105-847, and, um, did you maybe purchase anything online recently, like in the last few days?
Customer: Um, I bought... uh, there was that thing from... wait, was it Tuesday? Or, um, Monday? The, uh, the pet supplies place...
45. Pet supplies, perfect, that actually helps narrow it down quite a bit.
Customer: PetWorld Plus. That's what it was.
46. Oh! Okay so, um, I think I found it—PetWorld Plus, they actually, uh, process through—yep, here it is—transaction code TXN-847766-PWP shows Digital Commerce Solutions as their, um, payment processor, so that's probably what you're seeing there.
Customer: So, um, wait, the pet place is... uh, Digital? But why don't they just... I mean, that's so, er, confusing...
47. I know, right? It's honestly kind of, um, annoying how they do that—like I get probably twenty calls a day about this exact thing—uh, basically these companies use third-party processors and, um, your confirmation should be order ORD-9944-PWP if you still have that email?
Customer: Let me... oh! You're nice. This must get old...
48. Aw thanks, honestly you're being really patient about it, some people get pretty upset when they see charges they don't recognize.
Customer: Um, found it! ORD... uh, nine nine... wait, four four? That's, um, that's it! The, er, forty-seven fifty!
49. Perfect! Yeah so that's, um, definitely your PetWorld order then, and I'm gonna, uh, make a note here in case you need to reference this later—ticket number TKT-558831-CS—just in case you need to, um, you know, look back at this or anything.
Customer: You're solving mysteries over there. Like detective work but for... credit cards...
50. Ha! Pretty much, yeah—credit card detective, that's actually not the worst description of this job I've heard, and at least this one had a happy ending with finding your pet supplies order!
Customer: Right. So. Got charged twice for one feed delivery.
51. Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear about that double charge, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—hmm—if you could give me your, um, account number or the order reference?
Customer: Sure. It's, uh—wait, let me—order 4782.
52. Okay so, um, I'm looking at order FED-4782-XR and, uh, yes I can definitely see the issue here—there's, um, two charges on October 15th for $1,847 each and that's, er, obviously not right.
Customer: Obviously. Fantastic catch there.
53. I, um, I really wish I could just reverse this right away but, uh, unfortunately with feed supplier charges over $1,500, I need to, er, submit this to our billing disputes team with reference code DSP-9847-K.
Customer: Of course you do.
54. I know, I know, it's, um, it's really frustrating and I'm, uh, genuinely sorry about the process here—the dispute team usually, er, takes about 3-5 business days to review these and, um, then they'll issue the refund.
Customer: Three to five days. With my money. Great.
55. So, ummm, I can see you've been a customer since, uh, 2019 and this is, er, actually your first billing issue which—um—I'm going to note that in the dispute file DSP-9847-K to hopefully, you know, expedite things a bit.
Customer: Um, yeah, first time because I actually—no wait—I check my statements.
56. Right, right, and, um, that's exactly why this shouldn't have happened—let me, uh, also add a priority flag here and, er, actually I'm seeing the supplier code is SUP-447 which, hmm, they've had similar issues recently.
Customer: Similar issues. Meaning they're doing this to everyone?
57. Well, I, um, I can't speak to other accounts but, uh, let's just say your case reference DSP-9847-K is, er, going to include some additional notes about, um, pattern concerns with vendor SUP-447.
Customer: Uh-huh. So I just wait then. That's—that's it?
58. Unfortunately, um, for the actual refund, yes, but, uh, what I can do right now is, er, issue you a credit memo CMO-7739-PL for the duplicate amount that you can, um, apply to your next order immediately if you need to place one.
Customer: A credit. Not my actual money back.
59. So, um, you'll definitely get the actual refund—that's, uh, guaranteed with case DSP-9847-K—but the credit memo CMO-7739-PL is, er, just if you need to order more feed before the refund processes, so you're not, um, you know, out double the cash.
Customer: Right. Um, fine. Whatever. Just—just process it.
60. Absolutely, so, um, I've got everything submitted now—you'll get an email with, uh, both reference numbers DSP-9847-K and CMO-7739-PL, and, er, honestly if it's not resolved by Thursday, please call back and, um, specifically ask for escalation to management, okay?
Character 1: So, um, have you been, like, training for that Ironman you mentioned, err, last month?
61. Oh absolutely! I'm actually, you know, following this [enunciating every word] sixteen-week program that, well, builds up to about fifteen hours of training per week. The long bike rides on weekends are hitting 80 to 100 miles now!
Character 1: Wait, uhh, fifteen hours a week? That's, I mean, basically like having a part-time job, right?
62. It does sound intense, but honestly, when you break it down into, er, daily chunks, it's manageable! Like, I'm doing maybe two hours on weekdays, then those longer sessions on weekends, and, you know, it all adds up to those fifteen hours pretty naturally.
Character 1: Well, I was thinking about, um, trying a sprint distance first, but even that seems [angry] overwhelming with, like, all three sports to juggle!
63. Sprint triathlons are perfect for beginners though! We're talking, hmm, just a 750-meter swim, which is about, you know, fifteen minutes in the pool, then a 20-kilometer bike ride, and finishing with a 5K run.
Character 1: So, the swimming part, uhh, that's what [exhausted] terrifies me most, honestly, especially in, well, open water with all those people.
64. The swim starts can be chaotic, but here's the thing, most races now offer, um, wave starts with only 50 to 75 people going at once! Plus, err, there's always the option to start at the back and, basically, take your time finding your rhythm.
Character 1: Right so, what's the, you know, typical finish time for, umm, someone just starting out with sprints?
65. For first-timers, I'd say, well, [apologetic] anywhere from 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours is totally respectable! Actually, my first sprint took me, uhh, 1 hour and 47 minutes, and I was thrilled just to finish!
Character 1: And the Olympic distance is [belly laugh] double everything in the sprint?
66. Exactly double! So that's 1,500 meters swimming, 40 kilometers biking, and a 10K run. Most people finish those in 2.5 to 3.5 hours depending on their fitness level and the course difficulty.
Character 1: How much does all the gear typically cost?
67. You can definitely start with basics for under $500 total! A decent used bike for $300, goggles for $20, running shoes around $100, and maybe $50 for tri shorts gives you everything you need.
Character 1: Hmm, but I see people with, like, those $5,000 bikes and, err, all the fancy aerodynamic stuff.
68. Yeah, the gear rabbit hole is real! But honestly, at our level, training matters so much more than equipment. I mean, upgrading from a $500 bike to that $5,000 one might save you, uhh, maybe 3 to 5 minutes over 40 kilometers.
Character 1: So, nutrition during the race, um, how many calories are you, basically, supposed to take in per hour?
69. The golden rule is about 200 to 300 calories per hour for anything over 90 minutes! I usually, well, aim for 250 calories hourly through, you know, a mix of sports drinks and gels, which keeps my energy steady.
Character 1: Actually, what's the, err, cutoff time for finishing? Like, is there a limit where they, um, basically pull you off the course?
70. Most Ironman races have a 17-hour cutoff from the start, with specific timing gates along the way. Sprint and Olympic distances are way more relaxed though, usually allowing 3 to 4 hours total, which gives everyone plenty of time to finish!
Character 1: So, um, did you hear about the, you know, massive pivot announcement from, er, the product team?
71. Yeah, they're completely abandoning the B2B model [very sincerely] and going direct-to-consumer like Slack did back in 2013. It's a huge shift from enterprise sales to self-service signups, which could either be brilliant or catastrophic.
Character 1: Wait, I thought, hmm, we were following the, basically, Salesforce playbook with enterprise contracts?
72. That was the original plan, but apparently leadership got spooked by our burn rate and customer acquisition costs. They're looking at how Twitter pivoted from podcasting platform Odeo to microblogging and thinking we need that kind of dramatic shift.
Character 1: But we just hired twenty enterprise sales reps last month!
73. I know, and [very meekly] that's the part that really bothers me about this whole thing. Those people relocated their families, and now they're being told their entire role might not exist in six months.
Character 1: Actually, [deep pitch] the way I see it, you know, this is just like when, uhh, Netflix pivoted from DVD rentals.
74. Netflix's pivot from DVDs to streaming was gradual and strategic over several years though. What we're doing feels more like Instagram's overnight pivot from Burbn, just ripping the band-aid off completely.
Character 1: Speaking of Instagram, didn't Kevin Systrom say something about pivots being necessary?
75. He did say that recognizing when to pivot is crucial for startup survival. But he also had a clear vision - Burbn was too complicated, so they simplified to just photo-sharing, which became a billion-dollar idea.
Character 1: Oh god, [gasp] I mean, what if we, er, end up like, honestly, Groupon after their pivot attempts?
76. Groupon's [laugh hard] multiple failed pivots are, well, definitely a cautionary tale! They went from, you know, collective action platform to daily deals to, uhh, whatever they're trying to be now - a marketplace, delivery service, basically everything at once.
Character 1: So, uh, do you think management is, like, actually studying these pivot case studies or just, I guess, winging it?
77. Based on yesterday's all-hands, the thing is, they seem to be, hmm, cherry-picking success stories without, really, considering why PayPal's pivot from Palm Pilot payments worked while, err, Friendster's pivot attempts failed miserably.
Character 1: Right so, what about the, um, technical debt we've accumulated? I mean, our entire architecture is, basically, built for enterprise.
78. That's exactly the problem - our infrastructure is, actually, optimized for long sales cycles and, you know, high-touch onboarding. Pivoting to self-service means, well, rebuilding everything from scratch, honestly, just like when Flickr pivoted from that game, umm, Game Neverending.
Character 1: Okay so, are we looking at, er, layoffs then? The thing is, I just, like, signed a new lease.
79. From what I'm [whispering loudly] hearing through the grapevine, they're trying to avoid layoffs by retraining people. But realistically, converting enterprise sales folks to growth hackers isn't exactly a smooth transition.
Character 1: Well, I suppose we could, uhh, always end up like Slack - they pivoted from, basically, a game company to, you know, the biggest workplace communication platform.
80. True! Stewart Butterfield did pull off that pivot twice - first with Flickr, then with Slack from Tiny Speck. Maybe there's hope for us yet, though I'd feel better if our leadership had his track record.
Character 1: I can't get this painting right. It's driving me crazy.
81. Hey, what's going on with it? Sometimes the best pieces come from just letting go of what you think it should look like and embracing what it wants to become.
Character 1: I keep trying to, um, capture this feeling from my dream, but it's, you know, coming out all wrong and, honestly, looking like mud.
82. Dreams are tricky to translate visually, that's for sure. Have you tried using different materials, maybe mixing media or working with your non-dominant hand to break out of the pattern?
Character 1: I've tried [loudly] everything! Watercolors, acrylics, even charcoal sketches first.
83. Okay, I get it, [sigh], this is really frustrating you. But remember when you were stuck on that sculpture last year and then suddenly it all clicked when you stopped forcing it?
Character 1: Don't [groan] remind me about that disaster. Three months of pure agony.
84. But look, the thing is, that piece ended up being, [friendly], your best work! Maybe you should, well, try approaching this one through movement first, like, dance out the feeling and then paint?
Character 1: Dance? Are you [slurring] kidding me right now?
85. No no no, hear me out! There's this whole thing called authentic movement where you let your body express what words and images can't quite capture yet.
Character 1: That sounds, er, completely ridiculous and, I mean, I'm not a dancer, so, anyway, how would that even help?
86. It's not about being a good dancer, actually, it's about, you know, letting your body process the emotion first, and then, basically, translating that physical experience onto canvas.
Character 1: My neighbors already think I'm weird enough.
87. Who cares what they think? Look, hmm, creative blocks happen when we're, kind of, too much in our heads, and, I guess, movement can bypass that analytical part.
Character 1: Fine. But if this doesn't work, you're buying me wine.
88. Deal! And honestly, even if it doesn't work for the painting, at least you'll have gotten some of that tension out of your body.
Character 1: There's so much tension I could probably power a small city.
89. Well then, we should [overly polite] definitely get you moving soon! But seriously, when you're this wound up, art becomes forced instead of flowing, and that never ends well.
Character 1: Maybe you're, uhh, right about this, I mean, I've tried everything else, so, honestly, what do I have to lose?
90. Exactly! And, well, if nothing else, we can, er, laugh about you dancing around your studio, but, the thing is, I've seen this work for so many blocked artists.
Character 1: Did you know Comic Sans was originally designed for professional legal documents?
91. Wait, what? No, that's [enunciating every word] completely wrong! Comic Sans was designed by Vincent Connare in 1994 for Microsoft Bob, specifically for cartoon dog speech bubbles, not legal documents at all.
Character 1: Oh really? Well, I mean, my design professor told me, er, it was commissioned by, you know, the American Bar Association.
92. Your professor was either joking or seriously misinformed! Comic Sans was literally created because Connare thought Times New Roman looked too formal in speech bubbles for a cartoon dog assistant.
Character 1: Hmm, maybe you're thinking of, um, Helvetica? Actually, I'm pretty sure Helvetica was, like, the one made for comics.
93. No no no! Helvetica was [gasp loudly] designed in 1957 by Max Miedinger in Switzerland! It's a neo-grotesque typeface created for clarity and neutrality in corporate communications, nothing to do with comics whatsoever.
Character 1: Switzerland? I thought it was German. Helvetica means "German" doesn't it?
94. It means "Swiss" actually, from Helvetia, so, the Latin name for Switzerland, and, uhh, it was specifically designed to be, I guess, internationally neutral and clean.
Character 1: Right right. Well, anyway, kerning is just, you know, the space between lines of text, I mean, everyone knows that.
95. That's leading, not kerning! Kerning is the adjustment of space between individual letter pairs, while leading is the vertical spacing between lines of text.
Character 1: Same difference. Look, honestly, I've been doing design for, err, ten years and nobody really, like, cares about these technical terms.
96. These aren't just pedantic distinctions though! Understanding the difference between kerning, tracking, and leading is fundamental to creating readable, professional typography that actually works.
Character 1: Tracking is, well, just another word for, um, kerning anyway, [stern] so why make it complicated?
97. No, tracking adjusts spacing uniformly across all characters in a text block, while kerning is about specific letter pairs! These are completely different concepts with different purposes in typography.
Character 1: Whatever. I mean, serif fonts are called that because, actually, they were invented by, uhh, a French designer named Pierre Serif.
98. That's completely made up! The word serif, you know, comes from Dutch meaning "line" or "stroke," and, well, serifs have existed since, basically, ancient Roman inscriptions.
Character 1: Fine fine. But, er, at least we can agree that, I guess, fonts and typefaces are, like, exactly the same thing.
99. They're related but not identical! A typeface is, hmm, the design itself like Garamond or Futura, while, actually, a font is, the thing is, a specific implementation like Garamond Bold 12pt.
Character 1: You know what? I was just, um, testing you to see if you, [cry] actually knew this stuff, and, honestly, you passed.
100. Oh come on, you weren't testing me, you were just wrong about everything! But hey, at least now you know the real facts about typography, and maybe we can have an actual conversation about design.
Character 1: [startled] Jesus, um, you weren't there a second ago and I mean, [shaking], this cab only has one door so how the hell did you, [confused], get in here while I'm doing seventy on this, [breathless], godforsaken stretch of highway? [nervous laugh]
101. [hollow] Well, um, I'm always here.
Character 1: [defensive] Look, uh, I don't know what kind of, [trembling], hitchhiker game you're playing but, well, I've got eighteen thousand gallons of diesel behind me and I mean, [firm], I don't pick up passengers.
102. [gentle] You can't pick up someone who's, um, [distant], been dead for twenty years, you know. [sighs softly]
Character 1: [whispered] What?
103. My rig jackknifed right at, [fading], mile marker eighty-seven on a night just like this one.
Character 1: That's impossible.
104. The company never told you about, [bitter], the accidents on this route, did they?
Character 1: [reluctant] They said there were some incidents back in the day but nothing, [careful], nothing supernatural or anything like, [nervous], that.
105. [sad] I've been watching drivers pass through here for two decades now, [weary], some make it and some don't, and tonight I'm, [letting go], worried about you because you're driving, [urgent], exactly like I did that night.
Character 1: [angry] I mean, what's that supposed to mean—um, I've been driving tankers for, [defensive], fifteen years without so much as a scratch, you know?
106. [patient] You've been pushing too hard for three days straight and your, [knowing], eyes keep closing for those microseconds that turn into, [grave], forever when you're hauling this much weight at, [soft], this speed.
Character 1: [exhausted] I need this run.
107. [understanding] So did I, um, had a family to feed and bills piling up, well, [melancholic], thought I could handle just one more midnight haul, you know, but the road doesn't care about our, [fading], reasons. [long pause]
Character 1: [breaking] My daughter needs surgery and the insurance won't, [desperate], cover it without overtime hours.
108. [firm] Pull over at the next rest stop because your daughter needs a, [emphatic], father more than she needs the money from a, [pleading], dead man's final delivery. [voice breaking]
Character 1: You're saying I'm going to, [terrified], crash tonight if I keep going past mile marker, [shaking], eighty-seven where you, [hollow], died all those years ago.
109. I'm saying the fog rolls in thick at, [ominous], eighty-seven and the road curves sharper than, [urgent], you remember and your tired mind won't, [desperate], react fast enough when it happens.
Character 1: [resigned] Mile marker eighty-five.
110. [peaceful] Pull over now.
Character 1: I never thought I'd see you, [stunned], looking this fragile after everything you, [cold], did to destroy my life five years, [measured], ago.
111. [weak] You came here to what, [exhausted], watch me die with that same, [bitter], analytical mind that made our research so, [trailing off], groundbreaking before I took it?
Character 1: Um, actually, well, no.
112. The algorithm you're still, um, bitter about, well, it never worked properly without your, [hollow], contributions anyway. [coughs]
Character 1: [steady] That's the first honest thing you've, [quiet], said to me since the day you submitted my work under your name. [pause]
113. [rasping] Well, um, karma's funny.
114. [focused] The fortune I made from selling your research couldn't, [detached], buy me a cure for what's eating me from the inside out. [sighs]
Character 1: Stop playing victim.
Character 1: [controlled] You destroyed my reputation, um, made me unhirable in the field I loved, and, [tense], now you want me to feel sorry that you're, well, [ice-cold], facing consequences?
115. [desperate] Um, I know, okay?
116. [trembling] Every night I see the look on your, [breaking], face when you realized I'd betrayed you, and it haunts me more than, [whispered], this cancer ever could.
Character 1: [clinical] The data shows that, um, guilt-driven confessions during terminal illness have a, well, [analytical], seventy percent rate of being genuine, you know.
117. [frustrated] Even now you're analyzing me like I'm just, um, [defeated], another dataset instead of the person who once, I mean, [soft], stayed up all night debugging code with you.
Character 1: That person died the moment you, [sharp], chose greed over our partnership, over the, [hardening], breakthrough we were supposed to share, over everything we, well, [cracking], built together, you know?
118. [anguished] I've written you, um, three hundred emails trying to explain, to, well, [desperate], apologize, but I deleted every single one because words can't, you know, [hollow], undo what I stole. [sobs]
Character 1: [wavering] Three hundred emails means you thought about me every, um, [surprised], day for almost a year, I mean.
119. [exhausted] More like every hour since I realized that, um, success without integrity feels exactly like, well, [empty], dying while you're still breathing, you know. [long pause]
Character 1: [soft] The prototype we were building together could have, um, revolutionized predictive healthcare, could have, well, [regretful], maybe even detected your cancer earlier, you know.
120. [resigned] The cruelest irony is that I'm, [fading], dying from something our work might have prevented.
Character 1: [conflicted] I came here to tell you I finally rebuilt everything, um, got hired at a better lab, published new research, but seeing you like, [heavy], this makes all that vindication feel, well, [lost], meaningless somehow, you know. [sighs]
Character 1: [nervous] Um, I never thought I'd be sitting here, well, [confused], in a lawyer's office discussing whether saving lives could somehow be, you know, illegal. [sighs]
121. [professional] The Sherman Act doesn't, [measured], care about good intentions—it cares about market dominance and whether you've, [careful], prevented others from competing in what the DOJ is calling, [clinical], the 'heroic services sector.' [pause]
Character 1: [frustrated] But I mean, um, we're not selling widgets here, we're, [desperate], literally pulling people from burning buildings and stopping alien invasions—how is that, [incredulous], a market that needs competition? [exhales]
122. [calm] Your agency controls ninety-three percent of all, [steady], emergency response contracts in the metropolitan area, which, [gentle], from a legal standpoint creates what we call, [explaining], monopolistic conditions regardless of your noble purposes.
Character 1: Well, um, the reason we have those contracts is because, [bitter], smaller hero teams kept getting people killed trying to, [haunted], handle threats they weren't equipped for—I mean, [breaking], we had to consolidate for public safety.
123. [understanding] I hear you.
Character 1: You know, um, every single merger and acquisition we made was to, [defensive], save lives more efficiently, not to, well, [exhausted], corner some market. [groans]
124. [thoughtful] Um, I believe you, and well, [reassuring], that's exactly the narrative we need to build. [nodding]
Character 1: [hopeful] The irony is that we've been so successful at, [proud], protecting this city that now we're being punished for it.
125. [strategic] Success itself isn't illegal, but the methods by which you've, [careful], achieved market dominance might be problematic.
Character 1: I mean, um, what were we supposed to do—let incompetent heroes, [angry], keep operating just so there'd be competition while civilians, [voice cracking], died in the crossfire, you know?
126. [diplomatic] Well, um, the government's position is that you could have, [explaining], partnered with or trained those smaller teams instead of, you know, [delicate], acquiring or forcing them out. [clears throat]
Character 1: [resigned] We tried partnerships first but most of them couldn't, [tired], meet our safety standards or refused to follow protocols that, [firm], we knew saved lives based on decades of, [heavy], experience in the field.
127. [practical] Um, I mean, we need to document all those partnership attempts because, well, [focused], showing good faith efforts to collaborate before consolidation could, [optimistic], significantly strengthen our defense position.
Character 1: [anxious] Um, well, the press is already calling us a monopoly and saying we've, [hurt], betrayed the public trust by eliminating choice—I mean, [desperate], how do we fight that narrative while also, [worried], keeping the city safe? [sighs heavily]
128. [confident] We reframe this entirely—you're not a monopoly, you're, [persuasive], a public utility that happens to wear capes and, [warming], save lives instead of delivering electricity. [smiles]
Character 1: [curious] That's actually brilliant because utilities are regulated but, [realizing], allowed to maintain market dominance for the public good—so we'd be, [hopeful], acknowledging our position while justifying it legally. [laughs softly]
129. Exactly—we position your agency as, [steady], essential infrastructure rather than a competitive business, which, [building momentum], changes the entire legal framework we're operating within.
Character 1: [relieved] You know, um, I came in here expecting to be told we'd have to, [grateful], break up the team but instead you're, well, [emotional], actually fighting for what we've built. [voice catching]
130. [sincere] Well, um, my job isn't to destroy heroes—it's to, [determined], ensure they can keep saving lives within the law. [firmly]
Character 1: Um, I've been tracking these, [stunned], identities for seven years—Marcus Chen, Elena Vasquez, David Cross—and, well, they're all you, aren't they? [exhales sharply]
131. [defiant] So you finally, um, [amused], figured it out, though I have to say, [impressed], it took you longer than I expected, I mean, for someone in your line of work.
Character 1: [hollow] All of them, you.
132. [bitter] Every seventy years I have to, [weary], reinvent myself completely because mortals get suspicious when you don't, [frustrated], age like they expect, when your references from 1953 are still, [sardonic], mysteriously alive and willing to vouch for you.
Character 1: [trembling] The fingerprints never matched but the, [confused], bone structure in every photo was identical, and I thought I was, [breaking], going insane. [laughs nervously]
133. You weren't going insane—you were just, [gentle], the first person thorough enough to notice the pattern.
Character 1: [accusatory] Well, um, I flagged you as a potential, [tense], terrorist cell because, I mean, who else creates that many false identities except someone, [desperate], planning something terrible?
134. [exhausted] Um, yeah, someone who's been alive since, [bitter], the Bronze Age and just wants to, well, have a normal job and pay taxes like everyone else.
Character 1: [disbelieving] You're telling me that you're actually, [shaking], thousands of years old and you just want to work at, [incredulous], a marketing firm?
135. [resigned] Even demigods need health insurance these, [dry], days. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: Well, um, the FBI has been, [nervous], investigating you for three years because of my reports, and, I mean, [guilty], they think you're running some kind of, [panicked], elaborate identity theft ring.
136. [alarmed] Um, wait, the FBI is, [horrified], involved now because that's exactly the kind of, [frantic], attention that forces me to disappear again, and, well, I really like this city.
Character 1: [conflicted] I can't just make three years of, [struggling], investigation disappear without questions. [groans]
137. [pleading] Well, um, what if I showed you, [hesitant], something that would make you understand?
Character 1: [wary] Every con artist I've ever investigated has promised to, [skeptical], show me something that changes everything. [scoffs]
138. [determined] This isn't a con—watch my hand, [commanding], carefully.
Character 1: [gasping] Um, your hand is literally, [amazed], glowing with golden light and, well, I can feel the, [overwhelmed], air getting warmer like standing next to the sun.
139. Um, my father is Helios, and, [soft], every sunrise you've ever seen is partly his doing, I mean, partly mine too. [pauses]
Character 1: [awestruck] So, um, everything I thought I knew about, [lost], reality just shattered, and, well, I don't know whether to, [conflicted], call this in or delete every file I've ever written about you.
140. All I've ever wanted was to live quietly among, [melancholic], humans and experience what mortality feels like secondhand. [whispers]
Customer: Um, hi, so I was, uh, hoping to maybe add someone to my account? Like as an authorized user?
141. Right right. So, um, let me just pull up your account here with reference number ACC-7293-MK. I can definitely help with that today, though, hmm, there are a few verification steps we'll need to go through first.
Customer: Oh okay, um, that's—yeah I figured there'd be, you know, some kind of process.
142. Absolutely. So first, um, I'll need the full name of the person you're wanting to add, and, uh, let me see here... yeah, their date of birth and relationship to you. That'll generate form AUF-4482 in our system.
Customer: Um, it's my daughter actually. Sarah—no wait, I should probably give you her full legal name right? Sarah Marie Peterson.
143. Got it. Sarah Marie Peterson. And, um, her date of birth?
Customer: Let me think... hmm, April 15th, 1998. I think that's—yeah, that's right.
144. Perfect. So, uh, April 15, 1998. Now, um, there's typically a credit check involved when adding authorized users, reference number CRD-9847-TT, but since she's your daughter and under 26, we can actually bypass that requirement.
Customer: Oh that's, um, that's actually really good because, well... her credit's kind of a mess right now.
145. Yeah, I mean, honestly? Between you and me, um, the whole credit system is pretty rough on young people these days. Let me just, uh, mark this as a family addition under code FAM-2093.
Customer: I just—she's trying so hard to get back on track, you know? And I thought maybe this could help her rebuild?
146. Mm-hmm. Actually that's, um, that's smart thinking. Adding her as an authorized user on an account in good standing—which, let me check... yep, yours definitely qualifies with score bracket SCR-750+—that'll start reporting positive history for her immediately.
Customer: Um, so like, how long does this usually take? To process I mean?
147. So typically, um, it's instant for the authorization itself, but, uh, for the card to arrive? About 7-10 business days. Though, hmm, I can put in for expedited shipping under code EXP-3847-R if you need it sooner.
Customer: Could you? That would be—I mean, um, if it's not too much trouble?
148. No trouble at all. Let me just... okay so I'm putting through the expedited request now, reference number SHP-6629-QX, and, um, that'll get it there in 2-3 business days instead.
Customer: Um, this is probably a stupid question but, uh, will she like—can she see the whole account history and everything?
149. Not stupid at all. So, um, as an authorized user with designation type AUT-B, she'll only see transactions from the date we add her forward. Your previous history stays private. Though, uh, she will see the current balance and credit limit.
Customer: Okay that's—yeah that's fine. I just, you know, wanted to make sure before... yeah.
150. Totally understand. So, um, I've got everything submitted now, confirmation code CNF-8827-PLM, and you should get an email within the next hour. The card ships tomorrow morning, and, uh, honestly? This was one of the easier authorizations I've done all week. Sometimes these things get really complicated with all the verification requirements, but yours went right through.
Customer: So basically I'm I'm getting charged for like three days I didn't even have the equipment, so...
151. Oh no, um... let me just... what's the word... pull up your account here. Can you give me your rental agreement number?
Customer: It's it's RNT-4492, okay okay I need this fixed today.
152. Got it, so RNT-4492-LM7, I'm seeing the charges here and... yeah, this is ridiculous. Three extra days at eighty-nine dollars per day, that's not right at all.
Customer: Exactly! So like basically I returned it on the 15th and and you guys are charging me through the 18th!
153. Um, I see exactly what happened here. The system... it's this stupid automatic thing we have... didn't register your return properly. Transaction TXN-90847-B shows returned but then there's this, um, what do you call it... this ghost charge that keeps running.
Customer: So so can you just fix it? Like right now?
154. Absolutely, I'm already on it. Look, between you and me? This happens way too often with our rental system. It's embarrassing honestly. I'm crediting you the full two hundred sixty-seven dollars right now under adjustment ADJ-7823-KP.
Customer: Okay okay good, and like what about next time? This this happens every time basically!
155. Yeah no, you're totally right to be frustrated. So um... here's what I'm gonna do. I'm putting a note... a permanent flag on your account FLG-9901-MST that basically tells our system to, um, double-check all returns manually.
Customer: So basically that means what exactly? Like I just I just need this to stop happening.
156. It means, um... how do I explain this... every time you return something, instead of the computer just processing it, an actual person has to verify it first. No more automatic charges running past your return date.
Customer: Fine fine, whatever, I'm I'm just tired of calling about this stuff, so...
157. I hear you, I really do. And honestly? If I was running a landscaping business and dealing with this every rental... I'd be furious. The credit should show in twenty-four hours under confirmation CNF-4418-RRD.
Customer: Um so like basically you're saying twenty-four hours? Not not like a week?
158. Right right. Twenty-four hours max. Usually it's... what... maybe twelve? But I always say twenty-four just to be safe. And I'm also sending you an email with case number CSE-7799-LMP so you have proof of everything we discussed.
Customer: Okay okay, and and if it doesn't show up?
159. Then you call back with that case number and... I'm actually going to make sure... I'm scheduling a follow-up for Monday. If that credit hasn't posted by then, our system will automatically escalate it to management and add another fifty dollar courtesy credit.
Customer: So so that's it then? Like we're we're done here?
160. Um, yeah, we're all set. Credit's processing, the flag is on your account to prevent future issues, and um... again, really sorry about this mess. Your confirmation for everything is CNF-4418-RRD, and you should get that email within the hour.
Customer: Um. Got charged twice. For my cert renewal. Uh. Need to fix it.
161. Oh no no no, I'm so—wait, let me just—I completely understand how frustrating that must be, especially with certification renewals being expensive already, um, let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted right away, what's your account number or email?
Customer: Uh, let me see here... Email's. Um. J-Martinez-rad at gmail.
162. Perfect perfect, okay so I'm seeing—oh wait, sorry, is that J-Martinez-R-A-D at gmail? Just want to make sure I've got—yes okay, I see your account here, account number ACC-7829-RT22, and um, oh wow, yep, I can absolutely see two charges here.
Customer: Hmm. Yeah. Two hundred forty. Each. So that's... um... not great.
163. Oh my goodness, um, I mean that's almost five hundred dollars total and I know—look, I actually have a friend who's an X-ray tech and she tells me how expensive these renewals are already without getting double-charged, so let me just—I'm putting in a reversal right now for that duplicate charge.
Customer: Um, okay so. How long? Till I get it back? Er... the money?
164. So the refund—and I'm putting this through as priority, your case number is REF-9923-MED1—it usually takes about, um, three to five business days but honestly sometimes—wait no sorry, for certification stuff we can expedite, so probably two to three days max.
Customer: Uh... hmm. Actually? That's faster than... um. Expected. Nice.
165. Um, well yeah, I mean we definitely prioritize medical certification issues because—and between you and me—we've had so many problems with the system double-charging lately that my supervisor basically told us to fast-track all of these, your confirmation is CNF-4481-XR and I'm actually adding a note here about the inconvenience.
Customer: Let me see... um, you said CNF? Four four eight one?
166. Yes yes, CNF-4481-XR, and um, actually—oh wait, I should mention—I mean I'm also seeing here that your certification renewal did process correctly despite the double charge, so at least that part's okay, renewal ID RNW-2024-6672, so you don't have to worry about your actual certification status.
Customer: Oh! Um. Good. Was worried about... er... that too actually. Heh.
167. Right right, totally understandable, I mean imagine if you had to deal with the board about that on top of—anyway sorry, let me just make sure everything else looks—yep, renewal valid through December 2025, and the duplicate charge reversal is definitely processing.
Customer: Hmm, you know what? You're... uh. Really helping here. Um. Thanks.
168. Oh my gosh, um, well thank you for saying that, honestly it's been such a crazy morning and—sorry, that's not professional—but really I'm just glad we could fix this quickly because I know how stressful certification stuff is, and your reference number for all of this is TKT-8837-RAD just in case you need it.
Customer: Er, actually? One more thing. Um. Should I... like... call my bank?
169. So, um, honestly—and this is just my advice—I wouldn't call them yet because sometimes when banks and our system both try to reverse—wait, sorry, that sounds confusing—basically if you wait the two to three days and it doesn't show, then definitely call them, but for now our reversal code RVS-1106-CC should handle everything.
Customer: Okay so. Just wait. Um. Two three days. Got it. Er... cool.
170. Exactly exactly, and um, I'm sending you an email right now with all these reference numbers—the REF-9923-MED1, the CNF-4481-XR, everything—so you have it all documented, and honestly if there's any issue at all just call back and reference case TKT-8837-RAD and whoever gets it will see all my notes about expediting this for you.
Customer: Um, so I think I'm probably gonna have a, uh, sort of a timing issue with this surcharge thing?
171. Oh! Okay, um, let me just... what's the... let me pull up your account here. Can I get your—no wait, actually I should—um, what's your order number?
Customer: It's, um, I think... probably ORD-something? I don't know, maybe I should just... never mind.
172. No no, it's totally fine! I can look it up by... hmm, what's the word... your phone number! So let me just, um, search here and... oh perfect! I see it, ORD-7264-WV12, and it's showing a pending surcharge of—oh. That's... let me make sure I'm reading this right...
Customer: Yeah, um, "oh" is sort of the perfect word, I think.
173. Right, so um, it's showing $847 scheduled to process on the—wait, let me—no that's right, on the 15th. And you're saying the timing is...
Customer: Harvest money. October. So like, uh, maybe you see the problem here?
174. Ohhh, you're a winemaker! That's actually—okay so, um, between you and me? We get this a lot with agricultural accounts. Like, um, your transaction ID TXN485920164 is flagged as commercial shipping but, uh, what I could do is... hmm, let me think how to...
Customer: I mean, I'm just... I can't even deal with another thing going wrong right now.
175. No no, hey, we're gonna fix this! So here's what I'm—actually wait—let me just—okay, I'm putting a hold on that charge. Like right now. Done.
Customer: Um, wait, you can actually, uh, do that? Just like... stop it?
176. Well, um, technically I'm coding it as a... what's the term... seasonal adjustment? Under case number CSE-9847-BN. So the system will, uh, basically pause everything until... when's your harvest payment coming?
Customer: October twentieth, probably. I mean, I think. If nothing else goes...
177. Perfect! Setting it for October 25th just to be, um, safe. Confirmation code SFC-449281 and, uh, you'll get an email but basically... we're good!
Customer: So, uh, that's it? No forms or, um, I don't know, blood sacrifice or whatever?
178. Ha! No, just—okay so, um, here's the thing though. If anyone asks, you requested this like, uh, weeks ago and there was a... hmm... system delay on our end? Your receipt number RCP-3982-K shows the original request date as, um, let's say September 1st...
Customer: Oh so we're, um, sort of doing the whole, uh, creative paperwork thing here, I think?
179. I mean, agricultural businesses have, uh, unique cash flow patterns that our billing system doesn't really... anyway! The important thing is, um, your updated invoice INV-7749-AG22 will reflect the new date and you're all set!
Customer: This is probably the first thing that's, um, actually worked out in like... weeks.
180. Honestly? Um, winemakers are like, my favorite customers to help because you all are dealing with, uh, so much timing stuff and—oh! Also, I'm adding a note to your account AID-5584-WM about harvest scheduling so next year this won't even, um, come up. You'll just be... pre-approved for seasonal billing!
Customer: I had. Um. Three thousand points? They're just... gone. I really need those...
181. Oh no. Okay so, um, let me pull up your account right away here and, uh, we're gonna figure this out together. Can you give me your member number or, um, the phone number on the account?
Customer: It's, uh... 555-0298. I was saving them. For my daughter's... birthday present...
182. Got it, got it. So I'm looking at account MEM-78492-JK and, um, I can see you definitely had, uh, 3,247 points as of last Tuesday. Let me just, hmm, check the transaction log here...
Customer: Please. I just. Um. I promised her that gaming chair and it's...
183. Right right.
Customer: Sorry, I'm being. Um. Dramatic. It's just, uh, she's been having a hard time and...
184. No no no, you're not being dramatic at all, I totally get it. So, um, I'm seeing something here in the system and, uh, there's a redemption on November 3rd, transaction RDM-926841-L, for exactly 3,247 points. Did you maybe, um, already place that order?
Customer: What? No! I didn't. Um. I haven't touched the app since...
185. Okay so, hmm, this is... let me dig deeper here because, uh, I want to make absolutely sure we protect your account going forward. The redemption shows it was, um, processed at 2:47 AM Eastern time.
Customer: 2:47 AM? I was. Sleeping. Oh god, um, did someone hack my...
186. So here's what I'm gonna do right now, okay? First, um, I'm putting a security hold on your account, that's case number SEC-45782-BN, and, uh, I'm also gonna reverse that redemption because this looks... well, let me just say this doesn't look right to me.
Customer: You can? Oh. Um. Thank god. I'm sorry, I just...
187. Absolutely.
Customer: I feel so stupid. Should've had better. Um. Password or whatever...
188. No no, listen, um, these things happen and it's not your fault, okay? So I'm, uh, crediting back all 3,247 points right now, confirmation PTR-88263-Q, and, um, hmm, I'm also adding an extra 500 points for the trouble.
Customer: Wait really? That's. Um. You don't have to...
189. I do though, I really do. And, um, here's what else—I'm setting up, uh, two-factor authentication on your account, so basically from now on you'll get a text code, verification ID setup VER-20947-KL, anytime someone tries to redeem.
Customer: That's so. Um. Thank you. Really. She's gonna be so happy about that chair...
190. Perfect, and um, you know what? I'm putting a note here in case file CSE-88492-TN that, uh, if you have ANY other issues with this order, they should expedite shipping for you. Just, um, mention that case number and we'll take care of you, okay?
Customer: Um. So I got this... what's it called... invoice. Tool rental. Says I owe. Uh. Three times what I... hmm.
191. Oh yeah okay so um let me just—actually wait—I'm pulling up your account here and uh I need your rental agreement number if you have it, should be like RNT followed by some numbers?
Customer: Let me see here... it's... wait, no that's—sorry. RNT. Uh. 4429. No wait. 4492.
192. Perfect okay so RNT-4492-BX and um wow yeah I'm seeing what you're talking about here, they charged you—ugh this system is so ridiculous sometimes—looks like $847 for what should've been um like $280?
Customer: Exactly. But. Are you sure? That's... hmm. That's what it should be?
193. Oh absolutely, I mean um the daily rate for the drywall lift is $40 and you had it for uh seven days so that's $280 flat, but someone—and between you and me this happens way too often—someone coded it as three separate rentals under transaction codes TXN-9982-A through C.
Customer: How do I know. Um. You're not just... I mean. Three rentals? That's... suspicious.
194. No no I totally get why you'd think that, um honestly our billing system is—let me just—it's kind of a mess and uh I can literally see the timestamp here showing all three charges at 11:47:22 AM which is impossible unless you somehow rented three of the same tool in the same second?
Customer: Okay so that means... wait. Hmm. When do I. Uh. Get the money back?
195. So um I'm already starting the refund process—actually no wait let me—okay so I'm putting through refund REF-7061-QZ92 right now and uh normally they say 5-7 business days but um between you and me if I mark it priority it's usually like 2-3 days max.
Customer: Um. Priority? You're... you're sure that's... are you sure? Won't get you in. Trouble?
196. Listen um I mean technically I'm only supposed to use priority for like emergencies but uh this is ridiculous, you're a contractor trying to work and we messed up your billing so yeah no we're definitely fixing this today, I'm putting note ID NOTE-8847-PX that this was our error.
Customer: Let me think... hmm. What if it. Doesn't show up. In three days?
197. Okay so um if it doesn't show up—which it will but just in case—you've got confirmation number CNF-1129-8K4M and uh you can call back with that and honestly ask for me, I'm Jake, employee ID EMP-00847, and I'll personally escalate it to my supervisor because this is just—you shouldn't have to deal with this.
Customer: Jake. Okay. Um. But how do I... what's the word... verify. This is real?
198. Oh totally fair question um so you should get an email in like—actually let me refresh—yeah okay so check your email now, you should have refund confirmation from noreply@toolrentals with that CNF-1129-8K4M number and uh also I'm adding a courtesy credit of $50 under code CRD-9928-LM for the hassle.
Customer: Fifty? Wait. That's—sorry. You're adding. Extra? Hmm. Are you sure?
199. Yeah no absolutely um I mean you're calling from a job site dealing with our mess-up when you should be working so uh the least we can do—and honestly this whole triple-charging thing is embarrassing—so yeah that credit CRD-9928-LM will apply to your next rental automatically.
Customer: Okay so. Um. Let me see here. Email's in. Says... refund pending. That's. That's right?
200. Perfect yes exactly, so um pending just means it's processing through the bank but uh your reference numbers are all set—REF-7061-QZ92 for the main refund and CRD-9928-LM for the credit—and honestly if you have any issues at all just um give us a call back and reference this case number CSE-20241-DW7 and we'll get it sorted immediately.
Customer: So I just—I just need to, um, get my money back from an order I cancelled.
201. Oh yeah, absolutely, let me pull that up for you... So refunds are, hmm, honestly they're kind of a pain with our system, I'm not gonna lie. Do you have your order number by any chance?
Customer: It's it's, uh, somewhere here—wait no, I think—let me just—
202. No worries, take your time. I can also look it up by email if that's easier...
Customer: Email's, um, j-peterson-82 at gmail, I think—I think that's right.
203. Perfect, so I'm seeing... okay yeah, there's order ORD-9847-ML22 from last Tuesday, cancelled the same day. Is that the one we're talking about?
Customer: Yeah yeah yeah, that's—that's the one. Just tell me what I need to do.
204. Right, so, um, here's the annoying part—and I know, I know, it's ridiculous—but the refund got, uh, stuck in processing because of the same-day cancellation. System shows transaction ID TXN-884729-K pending since Tuesday...
Customer: Wait wait, um, stuck? What do you—what do you mean stuck? Is my money just, like, gone?
205. Got it.
Customer: Because I—I can't, um, I need that money, it's it's three hundred dollars and uh—
206. No no, your money's definitely not gone, it's just... hmm, so basically when you cancel same-day, it creates this weird loop in our payment system where, um, the authorization code—it's AUTH-7749-BK—doesn't release automatically...
Customer: Okay okay okay, so—so how long? Because I'm—I'm already overdrawn and, uh, the bank's charging me fees and—
207. Yeah, that's... ugh, I hate when this happens. So normally it's 5-7 business days, but, um, between you and me? That's way too long when you're getting hit with overdraft fees.
Customer: Five to—no no no, I can't—I can't wait that long, um, is there—there's gotta be something—
208. Okay so, hmm, let me try something... I'm gonna, uh, manually push this through using override code OVR-2847-XM91, which technically I'm supposed to get approval for first, but...
Customer: You can—you can do that? Like, um, today? Right now?
209. Right right.
Customer: Because I just—I just need to know if it's, uh, if it's actually happening or if I should just... whatever.
210. So I've, um, I've initiated it with confirmation number CFM-99482-TK, and... hmm, yeah, it's showing it'll hit your account within 2-4 hours instead of the whole week thing. Honestly our refund system is garbage, but this should, uh, this should work...
Customer: I sent it. Tuesday. Check your system.
211. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and, er, I'll need to verify—so basically can you give me your account number or, um, the reference number from your email?
Customer: Reference number. Right. How do I know you're not just...
212. So, um, I totally get that, like, you want to be careful and, uh, that's actually really smart—so basically I'm looking at ticket TKT-94827-JX here and, um, I do see some activity on Tuesday but, er, let me just double-check what we received exactly.
Customer: Some activity? What's that mean?
213. Right, so, um, what I'm seeing is like—okay so there's a submission at, uh, 2:47 PM Tuesday with document ID DOC-77459-BK but it's, um, showing as incomplete? So basically the system flagged it because, er, we need—let me check what specifically...
Customer: Incomplete. Course it is. This some kind of scam?
214. Oh no no, um, definitely not—so like what happened is, uh, the PDF you sent? It's, er, only showing page one of what should be, um, three pages according to form FRM-8823-V2, so basically we just need pages two and three.
Customer: I sent all three. I know I did.
215. Um, okay so, like, sometimes what happens is—and this is, uh, really common actually—the file gets, er, cut off during upload? So basically if you check your sent folder, um, the file size should be around, like, 2.4 MB for the complete document.
Customer: Hold on. Checking. File size is... oh.
216. So, um, is it showing smaller? Like maybe, uh, around 800 KB or so?
Customer: Point seven. Damn. So it really got cut...
217. Yeah, so that's, um, exactly what happened—but like, the good news is, er, I can keep this case open right now, case number CSE-55291-QM, and, um, if you can resend it while we're on the phone, I'll, uh, confirm receipt immediately.
Customer: Right now? While you're there?
218. Absolutely, so, um, I'll stay on the line and, er, basically as soon as it hits our system—which is like, usually within, uh, thirty seconds—I can verify all three pages came through and, um, get this processed today.
Customer: Okay. Sending. Should be there... now.
219. Perfect, so, um, I'm seeing it come through—document ID is, uh, DOC-77462-BL and, er, let me just... okay so all three pages are here, file size is 2.3 MB, and, um, everything looks complete now so I'm updating your case.
Customer: So we're good? Actually done this time?
220. Yes, so, um, you're all set—I've, er, marked it as complete in our system with confirmation code CNF-88346-XP and, uh, you should get an email within, like, five minutes confirming everything, and um, I really appreciate you being patient with this.
Customer: Um, hi. I'm calling about... my card got declined? At the gym. Where I work, actually.
221. Oh, um, okay so let me just... uh... pull up your account here and, hmm, I'll need to verify some information first if that's okay?
Customer: Yeah, sure. I know you gotta do your thing.
222. Right, so, um, can I get your, uh, member ID? It should be like a... what's the... a six-digit thing starting with MEM?
Customer: It's probably... MEM-4412. I think. Maybe 4421?
223. Let me check both... okay so, um, MEM-441221, that's pulling up, uh, Jake Harrison, and the account shows... hmm... let me just...
Customer: That's me. Look, I know this isn't your fault...
224. No no, it's, um, it's fine, really. So I'm seeing here that the, uh, the payment attempt was on, er, October 15th for $89.99 and the decline code is, um, NSF-7744-B which means...
Customer: Insufficient funds. Yeah. I figured.
225. Right, so, um, what we can do is... I mean, there's a few options here... we could try to, uh, reprocess it or, um, set up a different payment date if you need to... wait for... you know...
Customer: Uh, yeah, maybe we could just... push it back? Couple days?
226. Absolutely, yes, so let me just, um, update that in the system here and, uh, when would work best for you?
Customer: Um, like, Friday? I'm sorry, this is just...
227. Friday the, er, 20th? That's, um, totally fine, no judgment here at all, these things happen and... hmm... okay so I'm setting that up now with reference number REF-9982-XKQ.
Customer: I train clients there. At that gym. So it's kinda...
228. Oh, I, uh, I totally get it, that must be... yeah. Um, so the system's showing the new charge date as October 20th and, er, I've added a note here with code NTE-445 to make sure there's no, um, service interruption before then.
Customer: Thanks. Really. You're making this... less awful.
229. Um, that's really nice of you to say, I'm just, uh, doing my job but, er, I appreciate it. Is there anything else I can... or should I send a confirmation to your email?
Customer: Email's good. Sorry again for the... you know.
230. No no, please don't, um, apologize, seriously these calls happen like... er... constantly. Your confirmation number is CNF-788456-J and you should get that email in, uh, about five minutes or so.
Customer: Um, sorry, I'm just, uh, calling to check my—no wait, the queue? I mean, um, where I am in line?
231. Oh interesting. Let me check. What queue are we. Looking at. Today.
Customer: It's for the, um, passport appointment? I think I'm, uh, being silly but I just, um, wanted to know.
232. Um, no no, not silly at all! So, uh, let me pull this up and, hmm, I need your confirmation number, um, should start with PAP-something?
Customer: PAP-7824—sorry, 7834-Q.
233. Okay so, um, that's weird, I'm seeing, uh, two different queues here and, um, yours is in both? Hmm, let me just, uh, dig into this a bit...
Customer: Wait, um, two queues? I don't, uh, is that bad? Um, should I be worried because I really need—
234. No no. Don't worry. Let me just. Figure this out. System glitch maybe.
Customer: Sorry. I'm just. Bit anxious.
235. So, um, okay this is actually, uh, kind of fascinating! Your application PAP-7834-Q got, um, duplicated but only the first instance is, uh, actually valid.
Customer: Um, but which—I mean, uh, where am I? Like, um, how long do I have to wait?
236. Position twelve. Current processing. Eight minutes per person. So about ninety-six minutes.
Customer: Ninety-six min—that's over an hour?
237. Um, yeah but, uh, wait wait wait! I just, hmm, noticed something. You're, um, actually eligible for the express queue because of, uh, your travel date.
Customer: I am? Um, sorry, I didn't, uh, I should've known that? I mean, um, I probably filled it out wrong—
238. Oh! Um, no actually, uh, this is perfect! The system just, um, didn't auto-assign you but I can, uh, manually move you over right now, um, one second...
Customer: Really? That's—wow. Thank you.
239. And, um, boom! There we go! So, uh, you're now in position three, um, in the express queue EXP-7834-Q, and uh, that's about fifteen minutes wait.
Customer: Um, fifteen? That's, uh, that's amazing, I'm sorry for being so, um, you know, worried about nothing.
240. Got it sorted! That duplicate queue thing. Super interesting bug. Glad we caught it.
Customer: So, um, I'm sorry to bother you but like... I was supposed to get a callback yesterday?
241. Oh! Um, let me just... what's the... okay so I'm pulling up your account here. Can I get your... actually wait, do you have your case number? It should be like... CSE-something?
Customer: I think it's it's... CSE-4821-B? Sorry, I'm just... really bad with numbers.
242. Perfect! CSE-4821-B. Right. So, um... okay between you and me? This is... hmm, this is actually kind of embarrassing. Your callback was scheduled for 2 PM yesterday. And it looks like... well...
Customer: Yeah, so basically I waited all afternoon and, um, nothing.
243. I know, I know. Look, I'm gonna... what's the word... level with you here. Agent ID AGT-9923 was supposed to call. But there was this whole... thing. System crash. Total mess. Nobody's callbacks went through.
Customer: Oh. Oh god, I'm sorry, I thought I thought maybe I gave the wrong number or something.
244. No no no! Um, definitely not your fault. Like, at all. So here's what I'm gonna do... and don't, uh, don't mention this to anyone else calling in... but I can get you a priority callback. Within the hour. Guaranteed.
Customer: That's... I mean, um, that's really nice but like, I don't want to cause trouble.
245. Trouble? Nah. Between us? Um, I've got this little... workaround. Ticket TKT-88542-QV is getting, uh, let's say... creatively reclassified. VIP status. You didn't hear it from me though, yeah?
Customer: I just... I can't... sorry, it's been such a long week and everything's just...
246. Hey. Hey, I get it. Look, um, what was your original issue about? Like the... the thing you needed help with?
Customer: So so basically my account got, um, double-charged? Three times actually.
247. Three times?! Okay so... hmm... let me just... Reference RFD-6677-AA, RFD-6678-AB, and... yep, RFD-6679-AC. All on the same day. That's... wow. No wonder you're...
Customer: Yeah. And I'm just... sorry, I'm being so emotional about this, it's it's stupid.
248. Um, no? Not stupid. At all. So like... here's the deal. I'm expediting all three refunds. Right now. Processing ID PRC-445821-X. Should hit your account in... 24 hours. Max.
Customer: Really? I mean, um, they said they said it would take like five to seven business days last time.
249. Yeah well... that's the, uh, official line. But since we completely dropped the ball on your callback... I'm using override code OVR-1127. Don't, um, don't tell my supervisor I have that code, okay?
Customer: I don't know what to say, I'm just so so relieved, um, thank you.
250. Hey, um, pleasure's all mine. Confirmation number CNF-9884521-K for everything. And listen... if you need anything else? Ask for me directly. Agent Maria. ID MRA-4455. I'll, uh... I'll make sure you're taken care of.
Customer: Look, um, I need to know exactly what my plan covers, uh, right now.
251. I can definitely help with that—let me just pull up your account here, account number ACT-9982-VX47, and I'll walk through everything that's included.
Customer: Um, do you even, uh, know who I am? I'm platinum tier.
252. So I do see you're, um, on our platinum plan PLT-8847-Q, which is, uh, excellent actually—that includes, er, comprehensive medical, dental, vision, and um, there's also the wellness benefits package WB-2021 that I think you'll, uh, really appreciate.
Customer: Yeah but what's actually covered? Real specifics.
253. So, um, for medical—and I'll be really, uh, specific here—you've got, er, zero deductible for in-network, that's under code MDC-7749-A, and um, basically any specialist visits are twenty dollar copay, prescriptions are, uh, tiered from five to fifty dollars.
Customer: Wait, specialists? All specialists?
254. Well, so, um, I should clarify—it's, uh, it's most specialists but there are—sorry, let me correct that—certain, er, specialized fields like cosmetic procedures under exclusion list EXC-3847 that aren't, um, fully covered.
Customer: Um, but I was told, uh, everything was included when I—er, when I signed up.
255. Right right.
Customer: Look I pay, um, twelve hundred monthly, uh, that's more than—that's insane money.
256. I understand that feels frustrating, and um, I think what might help is if I, uh, go through your specific benefits statement BST-9984-KL22 line by line, so there's, er, no confusion about what you're getting for that premium.
Customer: My daughter, she—um, she needs this surgery and uh, I can't—
257. So for surgical procedures—and this is important—under your plan code SRG-8827-MX, you have full coverage for medically necessary surgeries with prior authorization, form PA-7749 needs to be submitted at least ten days before.
Customer: Um, what counts as, uh, medically necessary exactly?
258. Great question—so, um, basically anything that's, uh, prescribed by your primary physician for health reasons—not, er, elective or cosmetic—gets approved under guideline MNG-4421, and I can, um, email you the full list if that helps?
Customer: Er, yes, um, please—wait, orthodontics? That included?
259. So orthodontics is, um, kind of interesting actually—for dependents under eighteen, which I think applies here, you get, uh, up to three thousand in coverage under dental code DTL-8829-K, but, er, adult orthodontics is capped at fifteen hundred.
Customer: Three thousand? Um, that won't even—uh, do you know what braces cost?
260. I do understand, and, um, what I can suggest is—so there's actually this, uh, supplemental orthodontic rider, code SOR-9947-Z, that's, er, forty dollars monthly but increases that cap to six thousand, which might, um, make more sense for what you're looking at?
Customer: Um, hi, so I'm, uh, calling about an order? Let me see here... it's been, um, delayed twice already and I just...
261. Yeah, I can definitely look into that for you. Do you happen to have your order number? Should start with something like ORD or maybe PO.
Customer: It's, uh, PO-7739-N. That's what the last person said too, about checking into it...
262. Okay so, um, PO-7739-N, let me just, uh, pull that up here and... hmm, alright so I'm seeing this is for orthodontic brackets and, um, yeah it's showing delayed status as of yesterday.
Customer: Right. Exactly. And we have patients scheduled...
263. I completely understand, and looking at the notes here from case ID CSE-449281, seems like this has been pushed back twice now, which is... that's not okay, honestly.
Customer: Um, yeah, so like, I don't want to be difficult but, uh, maybe I should... I mean, could I possibly, um...
264. You know what, um, let me just, uh, check something here because I'm seeing a... what's the word... a recurring issue with this vendor code VND-8827-Q and, um, that might be part of the problem.
Customer: Oh. Okay so that means... what exactly?
265. So basically your supplier has had fulfillment issues across multiple accounts, reference number REF-20231-BK shows twelve similar delays this month, and I'm going to make sure you don't get caught up in this again.
Customer: That's, um, that's really helpful actually, I mean, uh, nobody explained it before, they just kept saying, um, "we'll expedite it"...
266. Yeah, I can see in ticket TKT-559302 that they promised expedited shipping last week, which clearly didn't happen, and that's just... look, between you and me, this vendor's been a problem.
Customer: So what can we actually do though? Because if it doesn't come by Thursday...
267. Right right, so, um, I'm gonna do something here... I'm transferring your order to our priority fulfillment center, new tracking will be TRK-8893-XP91, and that's... that's gonna bypass the problem vendor entirely.
Customer: Um, wait, you can do that? Because, uh, I was thinking maybe I should, er, talk to a supervisor or something but...
268. Honestly? A supervisor would just put you back in the queue with incident number INC-772904. But I've been here long enough to know the workarounds, and I'm making sure this gets fixed today.
Customer: Oh wow, um, that's so, uh, I really appreciate that, like seriously, you're actually helping instead of just...
269. Of course. I've updated your account with priority code PRI-5563-AA too, so next time you call, anyone can see you've had these issues and should get immediate escalation.
Customer: Thank you so, so much, I mean, um, this is exactly what I needed and, uh, you've been more helpful than... yeah.
270. You're very welcome. Your new confirmation is CNF-889234-R and you'll get tracking within two hours. And hey, I put a note in there that you work in orthodontics, so they know these are time-sensitive medical supplies.
Customer: So basically. My lockbox app. Like it's not. Opening?
271. Oh, um, okay so—let me just, uh—actually wait, can you tell me which, er, which lockbox system you're using? Is it, um, the SentriLock or the, uh, eKEY system?
Customer: SentriLock. So like. I have a showing. Fifteen minutes basically.
272. Right right, um, okay so I'm pulling up your account here and, uh, let me just—actually no wait—I need your, er, agent ID first, it should be like AGT-something with, um, six digits after?
Customer: So it's um, like AGT-482916. Thank you so much. Like seriously.
273. Perfect! So, um, I can see your account AGT-482916 here and, uh—oh wait, I think—no actually, er, it looks like your subscription expired, um, yesterday at midnight?
Customer: What. No. Like that's. I just. Okay.
274. But don't worry! I'm going to, um, I'm going to make sure we get this fixed right now, okay? So basically what I can do is, er, push through an emergency reactivation code, it's, uh, gonna be ERC-7729-XK and that should, um, get you access immediately.
Customer: You're amazing. So like. How do I. Enter that basically?
275. So, um, in your app you'll go to Settings, then, uh, then Account Management, and there's gonna be a, er, a field that says "activation code" and you'll type ERC-7729-XK exactly like that, all caps.
Customer: Okay so like, um, I'm typing it now and, uh, basically it's just. Spinning?
276. That's normal! It takes, um, about thirty seconds to—actually wait, er, let me just verify something—your device ID is, uh, showing as DEV-38847-B right?
Customer: How do I. Check that?
277. Oh sorry, um, that's on my end actually, I can see it here. So, er, while it's processing, I'm also going to, um, set up an auto-renewal for you so this doesn't—I mean, so you don't have to deal with this again, is that okay?
Customer: Yes. Please. So exhausted. From all this.
278. Um, totally understand, and I'm, uh, I'm really sorry about the timing with your showing and everything. The system should, er, should be coming back online right... now actually. Can you check?
Customer: Oh my god. Yes. Working. Thank you so much. Like seriously.
279. Perfect! And, um, just so you know, I've added a note to your account AGT-482916 that, er, that flags you for priority support, so if you ever—I mean, um, if anything happens again, we'll get you helped faster.
Customer: That's so. Kind. Really. Thank you.
280. Of course! And, um, your confirmation for today's reactivation is, er, CNF-99284-TM if you need it for, uh, for your records or anything. Good luck with your showing!
Customer: That's what the last person said, wait no, two people ago said. I'm just—I'm just done with this.
281. Right. Okay. Um... let me... what's the word... review your case. Account number AXC-7792-B. So, um, I can see you've called, er, three times about this issue.
Customer: Three? No no no, it's it's way more than that. Hmm, let me see here... at least six.
282. Got it. You're right. Um, I'm seeing, uh... six contacts total. Order ORD-9944-KZ. The, er, replacement request. Then the... hmm... escalation ticket TKT-40281. This has been, um, quite the journey.
Customer: Yeah so um, like, everyone keeps saying it'll be fixed and uh, nothing happens, you know?
283. Understood. Here's what we can do. No more runaround. Your case CAS-1188-QP9 gets priority resolution. Today. That's a firm commitment.
Customer: Sure. Right. Whatever you say.
284. I know. You've heard promises. But look. Um... I'm putting in a... what's it called... executive override. Code EXO-7734. This bypasses, er, normal channels completely. No more waiting.
Customer: Okay so that means... what exactly? Sorry, I'm I'm just tired of all this.
285. Um, so basically, uh, your refund RFD-5502-AA processes, er, within two hours. Not days. Hours. And, um, the credit—three hundred dollars—posts immediately to account ending in 8847.
Customer: Wait, three hundred? It was—sorry, I mean the original—it was two fifty.
286. Absolutely. Right right. The extra fifty? Um, that's... how do I put this... an apology credit. Code APL-9066. For the, er, massive inconvenience you've endured here.
Customer: I just—I just want this over. Can we, um, actually finish it today? Like really?
287. Yes. It's going to be okay. Transaction TXN-445599012 is processing. Right now. As we speak. You'll get confirmation within the hour.
Customer: Hmm, okay so um, if this doesn't work again, then what? I can't—I can't do another week of this.
288. It will work. But listen. Direct line. Extension 4429. My desk. If anything—and I mean anything—goes wrong, you call me directly.
Customer: Sorry I'm being so... I know you're trying. I'm just, uh, really really done.
289. No no. Don't apologize. Um, this is... er... completely understandable. Reference number REF-8823-VMP for everything we discussed. You've been, um, incredibly patient through what's been a... what's the word... nightmare situation.
Customer: Um so like, I'll get an email then? With all this, uh, confirmation stuff?
290. Right right. Email within, um... twenty minutes. Confirmation CON-7441-BX9. Plus the direct line. Plus, er, my personal follow-up tomorrow. This ends today.
Customer: Um, hi. I need to—sorry, I mean, uh, I bought this. Last month? No wait. Six weeks. Um.
291. Oh, um, okay, hi there! I can definitely, uh, help you with that today. Let me just, um, pull up your account here and, er, we'll take a look at what's going on, okay?
Customer: Look I know. Not your fault. System's the system.
292. That's, um, that's really kind of you to say actually. So, uh, can I maybe get your order number? It should be something like, um, ORD and then some numbers after it?
Customer: Yeah it's, um, hang on—no that's the—sorry. ORD-4. 4492. Um. LS91?
293. Perfect, I've got it here. ORD-4492-LS91. I can see this was purchased on October 2nd, so that would make it about... forty-three days ago.
Customer: Right. Past thirty days. I get it.
294. Well, um, so technically yes, but, uh, let me just, hmm, check something here because I think maybe we can, um, you know, work something out?
Customer: Really? I just—sorry, I mean, um, I tried the chat thing and they just. Cut me off. You know?
295. Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened. That must have been really frustrating. Let me dig a little deeper into your account RET-4492-B here.
Customer: You're actually. Listening. That's nice.
296. Of course I am! So, um, I'm looking at your history and, uh, you've been with us for, hmm, three years? And, um, zero returns before this, which is, uh, honestly really impressive.
Customer: Yeah I don't—I mean, um, usually stuff works? But this thing just. Stopped. After five weeks.
297. Okay, so it sounds like maybe this is less about buyer's remorse and more about a defect? Because that changes things quite a bit actually.
Customer: Defect. Right. Yes.
298. So, um, what I'm going to do is, uh, I'm going to file this under warranty claim WRN-8826-QM instead of a return, and, um, that gives us a lot more, er, flexibility with the timing?
Customer: Wait you can—um, sorry, you can just. Do that? They said—the chat said no way.
299. Well, I think the chat system probably just saw the date and auto-declined. But I'm actually looking at your case, and with defective items, we have a ninety-day warranty window, not thirty.
Customer: You're really. Helping. Thanks.
300. Absolutely! So, um, I've approved the warranty return under code WRN-8826-QM, and, uh, you should get an email with the shipping label in, hmm, about five minutes? And, um, we'll get you a replacement as soon as we receive the defective one, okay?
Customer: Um, I need help with these parking charges. I work there. I'm the chaplain.
301. Oh, um, okay so let me just, uh, pull up your account here and... hmm, can you give me your, er, employee ID number or the parking account number that would be on your statement?
Customer: It's probably E-4482. Look, I sit with dying patients every day and now I'm paying to park?
302. So I'm seeing account PKG-4482-EM here and, um, it shows... okay so there's, uh, three hundred and twenty dollars in charges from the last, er, two months which... I understand must be frustrating...
Customer: Three hundred? Um, that can't be right. That's my grocery money.
303. I'm, um, really sorry about this situation and I can see that, uh, you've been charged the, er, standard visitor rate of twelve dollars per day instead of... hmm, instead of the employee rate...
Customer: So basically you're telling me. I've been getting scammed. For months.
304. Well, um, I wouldn't say scammed exactly, but there's definitely been an, er, error in how your account was, uh, classified in system code CAT-7739-VIS when it should have been, um, CAT-7739-EMP for employee...
Customer: How do I even know you'll fix it? Like what proof do I have?
305. So, um, what I can do right now is, uh, generate a correction report with reference number COR-88425-PKG and, er, basically that'll reverse all the improper charges and... let me just process that...
Customer: I literally hold people's hands. As they die. And I pay to do it?
306. That's... I mean, um, that must be incredibly difficult work and, uh, having to pay for parking on top of... okay so I've submitted the refund for the full amount...
Customer: Um, when will I actually see that money though?
307. The refund with transaction ID REF-20847-AJ should, um, process within three to five business days, and, er, I'm also updating your status code to, uh, EMP-EXEMPT-4482 which means going forward you won't...
Customer: Wait. Exempt? So I shouldn't have been paying anything at all?
308. Well, um, chaplains and, er, certain other hospital staff are actually, uh, covered under policy code POL-EXEMPT-22B which... hmm, which means yes, you shouldn't have been charged anything...
Customer: This is insane. Er, can you check how long this has been happening?
309. Let me just... okay so, um, looking at your employment start date in file EMP-4482-2019, you've been, er, incorrectly charged for... uh, forty-seven months total which would be...
Customer: Forty-seven months? I think I'm going to be sick.
310. So the full refund amount I'm, um, processing now under case number CSE-994782-FULL is, er, six thousand eight hundred and forty dollars, and I'm... I'm genuinely sorry this happened to you...
Customer: Um, I really need your help, like, I'm kind of at the end of my rope here.
311. Okay so, um, let me just—hmm, what's going on? I'm, uh, I mean I'm here to help, so let me pull up your account real quick with, er, what's your account number or phone?
Customer: It's probably under, um, my company card but the charge went to my personal—God, this is such a mess.
312. Oh that's, um, that's actually really interesting—wait, so you're saying a charge went to the—no, sorry, let me start over. Um, what kind of charge are we, uh, talking about here?
Customer: Helicopter pilot certification renewal, um, twelve thousand dollars, and I mean, that was supposed to be on the company account.
313. Twelve thou—okay wow, um, that's definitely, uh, that's a big one. Let me see here... hmm, so I'm looking at transaction TRX-9043-HV and, er, yeah that's showing on your personal card ending in, um, 4782?
Customer: Yes! That's, um, that's my personal and I can't cover that, like my mortgage is due and I'm just...
314. No no, hey, um, we're gonna—I mean, let me just, uh, dig into this because that's, hmm, that's weird actually. The billing code BLC-CERT-2024 shows it was, um, it was manually entered but then—wait, let me check something else here.
Customer: Can you just, I mean, how fast can we reverse this? I kind of need to know.
315. Right right, so, um, normally it's—well, the reversal code REV-PENDING-03 would take, uh, three to five days but, hmm, let me see if there's a—wait, this is interesting.
Customer: Um, what if, like, what if the payment bounces? I literally don't have twelve thousand in that account.
316. Oh, um, oh gosh, okay so—let me, uh, let me flag this as priority because, hmm, I can see your usual billing profile BP-CORP-7721 and yeah, this definitely, um, shouldn't have gone to personal. That's—that's our mistake.
Customer: Your mistake? So you can fix it then, right? Like today?
317. I'm gonna—okay so, um, here's what I'm doing. I'm putting in an emergency reversal request ERR-12884-PRIORITY and, uh, also—you know what? Let me, um, let me call our billing team directly while you're on. Is that—would that be okay?
Customer: Yes, please, um, anything. I mean this is my whole livelihood here, you know?
318. No I totally, um, I totally get it. Being a helicopter pilot—that's actually, uh, really cool by the way. But yeah, let me just, hmm, okay so case number CSE-20241108-KT93 is created and I'm seeing... oh good, your company account is verified.
Customer: Hmm, so that means you can switch it over?
319. Actually, um, even better—so what I'm, uh, what I'm gonna do is, er, process code PRC-INSTANT-VOID which basically, um, it never happened. Your personal card won't even, uh, won't see the charge. And then I'll, um, rerun it on ACC-CORP-7721-B right now.
Customer: Oh my God, really? I mean, are you sure that'll work?
320. Yeah so, um, I just—actually it just went through. Confirmation CNF-844920-SUCCESS and, uh, I'm also sending you, hmm, let me also waive the, er, the expedite fee since this was—yeah, this was totally on us. You should be all set now.
Customer: So, um, let me see here... Got hit with roaming charges? While driving? In my own country?
321. Oh, uh, yes I can definitely, um, help you with that. Let me just, er, pull up your account here—can I get your phone number to, uh, look into this?
Customer: Yeah. 555-0182. This is... what's the word... ridiculous.
322. Okay so, um, I'm seeing your account here, number ACC-7294-BX, and, uh, there's definitely some, er, roaming charges from—hmm, let me just double-check this—looks like, um, multiple state crossings?
Customer: Right. I drive trucks. Cross states daily. That's the job.
323. Right right, um, absolutely, that makes total sense. So, uh, looking at your plan details under, er, contract ID CNT-8839-QM2, I think maybe there's been some, um, confusion about how the, uh, coverage works across state lines?
Customer: Hmm, okay so that means... I'm paying extra? Every time?
324. Well, um, not exactly—I mean, uh, it shouldn't be charging you like that. Let me, er, dig a little deeper here because, hmm, something seems off with how it's, um, applying these charges to your account.
Customer: Great. Just great. Another system glitch, I'm sure...
325. Actually, um, so I think I found the issue! Your plan PLN-4467-RK is, uh, set to the wrong, er, coverage tier? It's probably—I mean, um, it looks like someone didn't, uh, properly code it for interstate travel.
Customer: Wait, so you can fix this? Like actually fix it?
326. Oh absolutely! Um, and between you and me? I'm gonna, uh, not only fix it going forward but also, er, issue a credit for the past three months—that's, um, credit reference CRD-9901-LM7 for, uh, let me calculate... $247.83.
Customer: Okay so, um, that's... that's actually decent. When does that...
327. So, um, the credit should, uh, appear within 24 to 48 hours, and I'm, er, updating your plan right now—just need to, um, submit this form, reference number FRM-6628-TT9, and, uh, you should be all set!
Customer: Hmm, what if... what happens next month though?
328. Right, so, um, I'm actually putting a note here—note ID NTE-3384-WK—that, uh, specifically flags your account as, er, "interstate commercial driver" so this won't, um, won't happen again, I promise.
Customer: Commercial driver. Finally. Someone gets it.
329. Yeah, um, honestly? We get a lot of, uh, truckers with this exact issue, and, er, I think the system just isn't, um, set up right for you folks. But your new settings under, uh, update code UPD-7720-XR should, um, should fix everything permanently.
Customer: Alright. Um, so we're good? Just like that?
330. Totally good! And, um, here's a direct line—EXT-4492—if you, er, have any issues next billing cycle. But I really, uh, I really think we've got it sorted now. Is there, um, anything else I can help with today?
Customer: Um, I just... I don't understand these numbers? Like, they're saying I only drove... hmm, let me see here... forty miles last week?
331. Oh, okay okay, so um, I can definitely help you figure this out, and we're going to get this sorted, I promise, so uh, let me just pull up your account here and, hmm, can you give me your employee ID so I can see exactly what's—wait, actually, you know what, let me start with your name first, that's probably easier?
Customer: It's, um... Sarah Chen. I drive to... wait, sorry. Different clients. Every day.
332. Perfect, Sarah, thank you so much, and um, I'm seeing your account here, employee ID is EMP-7823-SC, and uh, you're absolutely right to call because I can see, hmm, there's definitely something that looks a bit off with your mileage for the week of—let me see—October 14th through 20th, showing only forty-two miles total, which seems really low for a full-time aide?
Customer: Forty-two! Yes! That's... I mean, that's just Monday. Just Monday alone.
333. Oh wow, yeah so that's, um, that's definitely not right then, and I totally understand why you're concerned, Sarah, because uh, if you're driving that much just on Monday, then the whole week would be—I mean, we're talking about, what, probably over two hundred miles at least, right?
Customer: Um, let me think... Monday is Mrs. Rodriguez, then... hmm, what if they're not counting the between visits?
334. Ohhh, that's, uh, that's actually a really good point, so let me check—um, sometimes the system only logs—wait, no sorry, I'm looking at the wrong—okay here we go, so your route log RLG-9847-OCT shows, hmm, it's only capturing your first arrival and final departure, not the, uh, not the trips between clients, which is, I mean, that's definitely an error on our end.
Customer: So I'm just... I need this money. For rent. Um, sorry, that's... but I do.
335. No no no, Sarah, please don't apologize, I completely understand, this is your livelihood and um, you know what, I'm going to personally make sure this gets fixed today, okay, because uh, looking at your history here—you've been with us for, hmm, almost three years, always submitted everything on time, and um, I can see your normal weekly mileage is usually around, let me see, two hundred and eighteen miles on average?
Customer: Two eighteen? That sounds... wait, is that with or without... hmm, I get confused about which miles count.
336. So, um, ALL your miles should count, Sarah—from your home to first client, between all clients, and then back home from your last client, and uh, I'm gonna, hmm, I'm gonna flag this for immediate review with code URG-4429-M for urgent mileage correction, which means, um, basically it gets processed within twenty-four hours instead of the usual week.
Customer: Twenty-four hours? But I... okay so that means... tomorrow? Or...?
337. Yes exactly, so um, by tomorrow afternoon you should see the corrected amount, and uh, let me just—I'm also adding a note here about, hmm, about the system error so this doesn't happen again, and actually, you know what Sarah, I think there might be, um, some back-mileage we missed from previous weeks too?
Customer: Previous weeks? I didn't even... um, let me see here... oh god, should I check all of them?
338. Okay so, uh, don't worry, I'm actually gonna do that for you right now, Sarah, because I can run a report—it's report number RPT-6632-AUDIT—and um, this will check all your submissions for the last, hmm, let me do three months just to be safe, and if there are any other discrepancies, we'll correct them all at once, and honestly this is something we should've caught on our end.
Customer: You're really... I mean, um, I was so worried about calling. About bothering anyone.
339. Oh Sarah, no no no, you're not bothering anyone at all, this is literally what I'm here for, and um, honestly, you're helping us because now we know there's an issue with the system and, uh, I'm actually going to—hmm, let me also add a compensation code, CMP-8851-X, for the inconvenience, which will add an extra fifty dollars to your next payment, because this shouldn't have happened.
Customer: Fifty dollars? That's... um, that really helps. So tomorrow I'll see... wait, all of it tomorrow?
340. So, um, the corrected mileage will definitely show tomorrow, and then the actual payment with the correction plus the, uh, the fifty dollar credit will be in your account by—hmm, today's Tuesday so—Thursday morning at the latest, and Sarah, I'm giving you my direct extension, it's 4487, so if you have ANY issues or if this doesn't show up exactly like I said, you call me directly, okay?
Character 1: Did you end up fixing that issue with your sourdough starter?
341. Oh yeah, so, it turns out I was, umm, keeping it way too warm, and, you know, the yeast was basically exhausting itself! Once I moved it to a cooler spot and adjusted the feeding schedule, it started bubbling up beautifully again.
Character 1: Well, I've been having trouble with, err, mine just not rising properly, like, at all.
342. That sounds frustrating! Mine went through a sluggish phase too, but switching to a mix of whole wheat and bread flour really gave it the boost it needed. The extra nutrients in whole wheat make such a difference.
Character 1: So, have you tried, uhh, that [chuckle] Dutch oven method, I mean, that everyone keeps raving about?
343. Actually, yes! The thing is, [clearing throat] it creates this, you know, perfect steam chamber that, hmm, gives you that incredible crispy crust. The first time I tried it, the bread came out looking like it was from a professional bakery!
Character 1: Um, my oven runs hot though, so, like, I'm worried about, well, burning the bottom.
344. Oh, I totally [empathetically] get that concern, honestly, because mine does too! What I do is, err, put a baking sheet on the rack below to deflect some heat, and, you know, it works perfectly.
Character 1: Right so, the scoring pattern, uhh, does it [bored] really matter that much, or, I guess, is it just aesthetic?
345. It's actually crucial for controlling how the bread expands! Without proper scoring, the steam escapes randomly and you get these weird bulges instead of a nice even rise.
Character 1: Hmm, what about the, um, hydration percentage you're using these days, like, for your regular loaves?
346. I've been pushing it up to around 75 percent lately! It makes the dough stickier to work with, but the crumb structure ends up so open and airy, with those gorgeous irregular holes everyone loves.
Character 1: Well, mine always turns out, you know, super dense no matter what, uhh, hydration I try.
347. That might be an issue with your gluten development! Are you doing enough stretch and folds during bulk fermentation? I do sets every thirty minutes for the first two hours.
Character 1: So, the autolyse step, I mean, how long are you, err, actually letting yours sit?
348. I go for a full hour minimum! Some people say thirty minutes is enough, but that extra time really helps the flour fully hydrate and makes the dough so much easier to handle later.
Character 1: Wait, um, you add salt [gasp] after the autolyse, like, not before?
349. Never before! Salt tightens the gluten network too early if you add it at the beginning, which prevents the flour from properly absorbing water during autolyse.
Character 1: The timing seems so [speeding up] complicated with all these different steps and rest periods.
350. Honestly, it seems overwhelming at first, but, well, once you get into a rhythm, it's just that, you know, everything flows naturally! I actually find the whole process really meditative now, especially during those long fermentation waits.
Character 1: So, um, what if we just, like, gave everyone the same password? You know, just "password123" for, err, everything?
351. That would be an absolute security nightmare! We're talking about potentially exposing thousands of user accounts, financial data, personal information, all because someone thought convenience trumped basic security protocols.
Character 1: Well, I was thinking, umm, we could make it [warm] more secure by, I guess, adding an exclamation point at the end!
352. Adding special characters to a commonly used password doesn't actually help much when everyone's using the exact same credentials. Hackers literally have dictionaries of these common variations that they try first.
Character 1: But imagine the IT support [angry] savings! No more password reset tickets!
353. The savings from reduced support tickets would be completely obliterated by the first data breach lawsuit. We'd be looking at millions in damages, regulatory fines, and complete destruction of customer trust.
Character 1: What about biometrics? Everyone just licks their phone to log in?
354. That's, uh, definitely not how biometric authentication works, though I appreciate the, well, creative thinking! Fingerprints, facial recognition, and, you know, iris scans are the standard biometric methods we actually implement for security.
Character 1: Wait, are you telling me my saliva isn't unique enough?
355. DNA is unique, but, hmm, [loudly] collecting saliva samples for authentication would be, I mean, incredibly impractical! Plus, err, the hygiene concerns alone would make this a complete non-starter for any organization.
Character 1: Fine, what about using people's favorite pizza toppings as passwords?
356. Pizza preferences are, actually, [sleepily] way too predictable for secure authentication, you know? I mean, pepperoni and cheese would probably, uhh, cover half the user base right there.
Character 1: Okay so, what if we, hmm, trained pigeons to deliver, basically, physical authentication tokens to people's windows?
357. The logistics of, well, maintaining a pigeon fleet for authentication would be, honestly, astronomical! Not to mention, um, weather delays, bird strikes, and the fact that, basically, most office buildings have sealed windows these days.
Character 1: You're no fun. What about astrology-based access control?
358. Basing security on birth dates and zodiac signs would give attackers a massive advantage since that information is often publicly available on social media. Plus, you'd have one-twelfth of your users locked out during Mercury retrograde!
Character 1: Right so, how about we, er, just use interpretive dance? Like, everyone has their own, you know, security shimmy?
359. Movement-based authentication actually, uhh, exists in some experimental forms, but interpretive dance would be, I guess, incredibly subjective! The thing is, computers need consistent, measurable patterns, not, well, artistic expression for authentication.
Character 1: So, umm, you're saying my robot dance isn't, like, secure enough? Even with the, err, special arm movements?
360. Your robot dance is probably very entertaining, but for actual identity management, we need multi-factor authentication combining something you know, something you have, and something you are. Though I'd pay to see you try that at the security checkpoint!
Character 1: Did you see the Phase III results came in for our Alzheimer's drug?
361. Wait, they're already in? I thought we weren't expecting data until next quarter! What's the primary endpoint showing - did we hit statistical significance on cognitive decline?
Character 1: We did! The p-value was, um, incredible - 0.0001 on the ADAS-Cog scale, and, you know, the safety profile looks clean too.
362. That's phenomenal! So, how much improvement are we, er, talking about here compared to placebo? And more importantly, did we see, actually, any difference in the biomarker subgroups we were, honestly, worried about?
Character 1: 47% slower decline over 18 months, which is, like, unprecedented. The tau-positive subgroup showed, I mean, even better results than we, basically, anticipated.
363. This changes everything for early-stage patients! Are you, hmm, telling me we beat Biogen's numbers? What about the secondary endpoints - did we hit, you know, functional outcomes and caregiver burden metrics too, or just, well, the cognitive scores?
Character 1: Every single secondary endpoint hit. The FDA is, uhh, expediting our review now, and, kind of, Japan's PMDA wants to, anyway, fast-track us too.
364. No way! You're telling me we're [joking] about to become the next blockbuster? But seriously, what's our manufacturing capacity looking like - can we, uh, actually scale up production if we get, basically, approved in multiple markets simultaneously?
Character 1: The CMO says we can, err, produce enough for 500,000 patients by launch, and, I guess, double that within, like, six months.
365. [sigh] Finally, after all those failed trials in this space! How are the investors reacting - has the stock price reflected this yet, or are people still skeptical given the field's history?
Character 1: Stock's up 340% in pre-market trading. Analysts are calling it the biggest breakthrough since Keytruda.
366. That's insane momentum! What about the patient advocacy groups - have they seen the data yet? And more crucially, what's our pricing strategy going to be to ensure access while recouping our investment?
Character 1: The Alzheimer's Association is, well, planning a press conference tomorrow to, sort of, endorse our findings publicly.
367. This is career-defining work! Have you thought about what this means for the expanded access program? We're going to have thousands of patients wanting treatment before approval, right?
Character 1: I'm, honestly, so excited I could, [child-like] you know, cry! The compassionate use protocol is, hmm, already drafted and ready.
368. You should be proud - you've been on this, actually, project for what, seven years now? Speaking of which, have we, umm, started thinking about combination trials with other mechanisms, or are we, the thing is, focusing on monotherapy first?
Character 1: Seven and a half years, but who's counting? The combination trials are, so, already being designed with, I mean, three different partners lined up.
369. Which partners - are we talking about, err, beta-amyloid antibodies or something more novel? And have we, basically, considered pediatric applications for, it's just that, early-onset genetic variants?
Character 1: Lilly, Roche, and surprisingly, that startup NeuroPlex with their microglial modulator.
370. NeuroPlex makes perfect sense given their mechanism! Have you, well, looked at their preclinical synergy data? I heard they're showing, kind of, remarkable results in the APP/PS1 mouse model when combined with, anyway, tau-targeting approaches like ours.
Character 1: So, um, have you ever thought about, like, how cities actually breathe at night?
371. Oh that's, you know, such an intricate way to put it - cities really do have this, er, replenishing quality after midnight when the streets empty out and, I mean, you can finally hear the infrastructure humming beneath everything.
Character 1: Well, I was walking home and, uh, noticed how different everything, actually, feels.
372. There's this whole [cheerful] hidden ecosystem that emerges - night shift workers restocking stores, street cleaners doing their rounds, delivery trucks navigating empty roads that would be gridlocked during the day.
Character 1: The thing is, hmm, I never really noticed until, you know, I started working late.
373. Right so, the city kind of, uhh, repairs itself while we sleep - construction crews fixing roads, err, maintenance teams checking subway tracks, and honestly, even the air quality improves without all the traffic.
Character 1: I guess, um, it's like watching something, well, reset itself.
374. Exactly! And there's [chuckle] something almost meditative about witnessing that transformation, how the harsh edges of daytime soften into these gentler rhythms that most people never experience.
Character 1: Actually, I've been, uh, photographing empty streets lately, you know?
375. That must capture such, hmm, replenishing moments - the way streetlights create these, basically, intricate shadow patterns without crowds interrupting them, and like, how buildings seem to exhale when they're not packed with people.
Character 1: Sometimes I just sit [monotone] on my fire escape and watch.
376. Those quiet observation points become these perfect vantage spots for understanding how intricately connected everything is - watching garbage trucks coordinate their routes, seeing how traffic lights cycle through empty intersections, noticing which windows stay lit all night.
Character 1: Do you, er, ever feel like the city is, I mean, more honest at night?
377. Absolutely - it's like, well, all the performance drops away and you see the real machinery, uhh, the actual systems that keep everything functioning, sort of stripped of their daytime disguises.
Character 1: There's this deli owner who told me he prefers the night shift.
378. Night workers develop this whole different relationship with the city - they see it in its most vulnerable and replenishing state, when it's maintaining itself for the next day's chaos.
Character 1: He said the regular 3am customers become like family.
379. Those connections form so intricately because everyone who's awake at that hour shares this unspoken understanding - you're all witnessing the same quiet transformation, participating in this parallel life that exists alongside the daylight world.
Character 1: It's just that, anyway, I'm starting to, honestly, prefer those hours myself.
380. Once you tune into that nighttime frequency, the city reveals all these replenishing rituals and intricate patterns that were always there, just hidden beneath the noise and rush of regular life.
Character 1: AI is going to replace all of us. Every creative job, gone.
381. I hear that fear, I really do. But I think we're looking at augmentation rather than replacement - humans bring context, emotion, and genuine understanding that AI simply can't replicate.
Character 1: That's, um, exactly what they said about factory workers, and, you know, look how that turned out for them, honestly.
382. You're right, actually, automation has displaced workers before, and, well, we shouldn't ignore that history, but, I mean, this time we have a chance to shape it differently.
Character 1: How? The tech companies don't care about us.
383. I know it seems, [very quietly], hopeless sometimes, but, er, there are actually artists and, kind of, ethicists working directly with AI developers now to establish better guidelines.
Character 1: Guidelines won't stop them from stealing our work to train their models.
384. That's absolutely a valid concern, and you're right to be angry about it. The current practices around training data are ethically questionable at best, and we need stronger legal protections.
Character 1: At least you [animated] admit it's theft! Everyone else acts like it's progress.
385. It is theft when it's done without consent, so, I completely agree with you there, and, basically, we need opt-in systems, not this, hmm, scraping everything approach.
Character 1: But the damage is already done. They've already trained on millions of images.
386. You're absolutely right, and I'm not trying to minimize that harm. What's been done is wrong, and artists deserve compensation and the ability to have their work removed.
Character 1: Finally someone, [very excited], who gets it! But, uh, how do we even fight back when they have, I guess, billions of dollars?
387. Collective action is our best bet - unions, legal challenges, public pressure. The Writers Guild showed us that organized resistance can work, even against tech giants.
Character 1: The writers only won because they could actually strike.
388. True, and, well, visual artists don't have that same leverage, but, honestly, there are other tactics like, err, poisoning datasets with tools like Nightshade and Glaze.
Character 1: I've been using Glaze but, um, it feels like putting a bandaid on, you know, a severed limb.
389. I understand that feeling of inadequacy, really, but, the thing is, every small act of resistance matters, and, actually, these tools are getting more sophisticated every day.
Character 1: Maybe. I just don't want my art feeding some machine.
390. And you have every right to protect your work, so, please know that, uhh, your anger is justified, and, basically, I'll keep advocating for artists' rights alongside you.
Character 1: How do you decide what to photograph when you're out there?
391. You know, it's like waiting for the universe to [cry loudly] wink at you through the viewfinder. Sometimes the light just tells you exactly where to point your lens, and sometimes you're standing there for hours wondering why you drove three hundred miles to stare at a boring mountain.
Character 1: That sounds pretty random though.
392. Not random exactly, more like, well, informed intuition mixed with, you know, pure stubbornness and, basically, a willingness to fail spectacularly sometimes. The best shots often come from the worst decisions, if that makes any sense.
Character 1: Do you ever regret choosing photography over something more stable?
393. Regret's a strong word, but, hmm, there are mornings when I'm freezing at 4am waiting for sunrise and, actually, wondering if accounting would've been, I mean, simpler. Then the light breaks through the clouds and suddenly tax forms seem like the dumbest thing humanity ever invented.
Character 1: [groan] I can't even imagine waking up that early by choice.
394. The golden hour doesn't negotiate its schedule, my friend. Mother Nature runs her light show precisely when she wants to, and if you want front row seats, you better set that alarm or miss the performance entirely.
Character 1: But, like, how do you know if, umm, a shot is worth taking or if you're, er, just wasting film or, you know, memory space?
395. Here's the secret nobody tells you about [smiling speaking] photography or really any creative decision. Every shot you don't take is definitely a miss, but every shot you do take teaches you something, even if it's just what not to do next time.
Character 1: That's surprisingly philosophical.
396. Spend enough time alone with mountains and, uhh, you either become a philosopher or, basically, start having full conversations with squirrels, and, well, only one of those pays the bills occasionally.
Character 1: Do you, um, plan your shots extensively or just, sort of, wing it when you get there?
397. Both and neither. I'll research sun angles and weather patterns obsessively, then throw it all out the window when a random storm cloud creates magic that no app could've predicted.
Character 1: Sounds frustrating.
398. Frustrating is spending three days camping in, actually, mosquito hell waiting for the perfect sunset that, you know, never comes, then catching the most incredible light on the drive home when, honestly, all your gear is packed away.
Character 1: [empathetically] I struggle with big decisions too, always second-guessing myself.
399. Second-guessing is just your brain's way of, hmm, pretending there's a perfect choice when, the thing is, most decisions are just different flavors of, well, acceptable chaos. Pick one, commit fully, adjust as needed.
Character 1: [laugh histerically] Different flavors of acceptable chaos? That's, um, actually brilliant and, like, terrifying.
400. Welcome to life through a viewfinder, where, er, every frame is both the wrong choice and, basically, the only choice, and somehow, you know, that's exactly how it should be.
Character 1: So, um, how do you actually, like, write dialogue that sounds, you know, natural?
401. Well, here's the thing, most people think natural dialogue means, uh, copying exactly how people speak, but actually that would be terrible to read. Real conversation is full of dead ends and boring tangents that nobody wants to sit through.
Character 1: Oh, I mean, that's [very excited] exactly what I've been, sort of, struggling with!
402. Mmm, struggling is interesting word choice, because, you know, it implies you're fighting against something when really, er, you should be embracing the artifice. You do realize that all dialogue is fake, right? Even this conversation we're having right now.
Character 1: Wait, what do you mean by that?
403. I mean, hmm, you asked me about dialogue writing, and here we are, basically, having a dialogue about dialogue, which is, honestly, either brilliantly meta or completely pointless. But you already knew that when you asked, didn't you?
Character 1: I just wanted some advice.
404. Advice, sure, but, like, you're recording this, aren't you? Or, uhh, at least taking mental notes for something you're, well, working on. Nobody asks about dialogue writing without having a specific project eating at them.
Character 1: How did you know?
405. Because, actually, you're doing that thing where you ask short questions to, you know, keep me talking, and, err, that's exactly what amateur writers think good dialogue looks like. See how easy it is to spot patterns once you know what to look for?
Character 1: That's, um, pretty presumptuous and, like, kind of rude, honestly.
406. Rude would be not telling you that, er, your dialogue probably sounds stilted because you're, the thing is, trying too hard to be clever instead of, basically, letting characters actually disagree with each other.
Character 1: So, uh, you think I'm, I guess, not good at this? That's, well, what you're saying?
407. I'm saying you're asking the wrong questions. Instead of how to write natural dialogue, you should be asking why your characters never surprise you when they speak.
Character 1: Maybe, um, they don't need to, like, surprise me all the, you know, time.
408. Oh but they do, because, actually, if you already know everything they're going to say, then, hmm, you're not writing dialogue, you're just, sort of, transcribing your own thoughts through different mouths.
Character 1: That's, well, that's actually, uhh, a fair point, I guess.
409. Fair point, he says, like we're having [very quickly] a debate instead of me systematically dismantling your approach to writing. But sure, we can call it fair if that makes you feel better about what just happened here.
Character 1: You're, um, kind of an ass, but, like, you might be, honestly, right about this.
410. Right about this, wrong about that, it doesn't matter because you'll keep making the same mistakes until you stop trying to control what your characters say and start listening to what they want to say instead.
Character 1: So, um, have you been following, like, what PredictIt is saying about, you know, the Iowa caucuses?
411. Oh absolutely, PredictIt has been wild lately with their contracts on the Republican primary. Last I checked, Trump was trading at around 87 cents in their Iowa market, which seems high but honestly might still be undervalued given recent Des Moines Register polling.
Character 1: That's really interesting because, well, I was looking at [trailing off] Polymarket too and, er, their numbers seem kind of... different somehow?
412. Yeah, so, Polymarket definitely skews different because, hmm, they use USDC cryptocurrency and attract, basically, a younger international crowd versus PredictIt's more traditional American political bettors. The spreads between them on something like the New Hampshire primary can be five or six cents sometimes.
Character 1: Do you prefer one over the other?
413. Honestly depends what I'm looking for. Kalshi has better liquidity for economic indicators like Fed rate decisions, while Manifold Markets is great for weird niche questions even though they use play money instead of real stakes.
Character 1: I didn't realize there were so many different platforms!
414. Oh there's tons more too. Betfair in the UK, Smarkets for sports, even crypto-native ones like Augur and Gnosis that run on Ethereum. Each market has its own quirks and biases depending on who's actually putting money down.
Character 1: Which one would you recommend for someone just starting out?
415. Well, actually, if you're brand new I'd say, er, start with Metaculus because it's, you know, purely reputation-based so you can learn without risking real money. Once you get comfortable predicting, then maybe try PredictIt since they limit positions to $850 which keeps things manageable.
Character 1: That's really thoughtful advice, thank you!
416. No problem at all. The key is understanding that places like FiveThirtyEight aggregate these markets for a reason - they often outperform traditional polling, especially for events like the Nevada Senate race or California recall elections.
Character 1: I used to check Intrade all the [very melancholic] time before they shut down. Miss those days sometimes.
417. Oh man, yeah, Intrade was, I mean, revolutionary for its time, though honestly, the CFTC crackdown was, uhh, probably inevitable given how loosely they interpreted commodity regulations. At least we have more options now even if they're more restricted.
Character 1: Do you think the regulations will ever loosen up?
418. Maybe, um, eventually? The CFTC did approve Kalshi's congressional [shy] control markets, which was, like, a huge deal, so there's definitely, you know, some movement toward legitimizing political prediction markets in America.
Character 1: That would be, well, really nice because, basically, I think these markets serve, er, an important democratic function.
419. Absolutely, and actually, Robin Hanson at George Mason has been, hmm, arguing this for decades - that prediction markets aggregate information, like, way more efficiently than polls or pundits ever could.
Character 1: You know so much about this! I'm [laugh] genuinely impressed and also slightly overwhelmed!
420. Ha, well, I've been, sort of, obsessed with this stuff since the Romney-Obama race on Intrade, so, you know, I've had plenty of time to, basically, accumulate all these random facts about Iowa Electronic Markets and British bookmakers like Ladbrokes.
Character 1: Have you seen the Q3 numbers [anxious] for SMB acquisition costs? They're getting brutal.
421. Yeah, CAC to LTV ratios are completely underwater for most verticals. We're seeing $1,800 average acquisition costs for accounts that barely clear $500 monthly recurring revenue - it's unsustainable without significant federal intervention.
Character 1: What kind of intervention are you thinking?
422. Senator Mitchell's office is drafting legislation for R&D tax credits specifically targeting sales automation tools. If we can reduce SDR headcount requirements by 40% through AI qualification, the unit economics start working again.
Character 1: But, um, wouldn't that just, like, accelerate the race to the bottom on, you know, pricing?
423. Not necessarily - I mean, the real issue is that, er, SMBs have fragmented buying committees now, so your sales cycle, basically, stretches from 21 to 47 days on average.
Character 1: Well, our close rates are, hmm, tanking too - down to, actually, 12% from initial demo, you know?
424. The committee is actually [whispering] considering mandatory procurement transparency rules that would require businesses to disclose vendor evaluation timelines, which could compress decision cycles by forcing accountability.
Character 1: That seems pretty aggressive regulatory-wise.
425. Sure, but, honestly, we're modeling this after GDPR's impact - initially disruptive but, uhh, ultimately it created standardization that, well, reduced compliance costs by 30% industry-wide after eighteen months.
Character 1: GDPR was a [bitter] nightmare for our European expansion though. Killed our margins completely.
426. Right, I know the implementation was [apologetic] rough, and we should've provided better transition support. This time we're proposing a two-year phase-in with exemptions for companies under $10 million ARR.
Character 1: What about channel partnerships? They're eating 20% off the top.
427. So, channel margins are, actually, another focus area - we're looking at, hmm, capping referral fees at 15% for government contracts, which would, basically, set a market precedent.
Character 1: Err, wouldn't VARs just, like, revolt? They're already, um, struggling with compressed margins.
428. Well, the thing is, VARs would get, you know, preferential treatment in federal procurement scoring, which is worth, uhh, billions annually, so it's actually a net positive for established players.
Character 1: I guess that makes, er, sense if you're thinking about, sort of, the total addressable market expanding, right so?
429. Exactly - it's just that, like, if we can reduce friction in the, hmm, middle market, total SMB software spend could increase by, honestly, $47 billion according to our CBO projections.
Character 1: Wait, that's, um, actually [extremely happy] incredible! We could, basically, triple our TAM!
430. Precisely. The legislative package hits the floor next month, and we've already got backing from both the Software Alliance and National Small Business Association, which never happens.
Character 1: I really think we can [empathetically] restore public trust in journalism! We just need to be more transparent!
431. Oh, I absolutely appreciate [overly polite] your optimism, and transparency is certainly important, but the erosion of trust stems from deeper systemic issues like corporate ownership concentration and algorithmic distribution.
Character 1: But what about the new disclosure standards? They're revolutionary!
432. Well, disclosure standards are, um, a start, but they don't address, you know, the fundamental incentive misalignment where, basically, engagement metrics drive editorial decisions over public interest.
Character 1: Come on, that's [laugh loudly] so cynical! We're seeing, er, incredible innovation in, like, nonprofit journalism models, actually!
433. ProPublica and The Marshall Project are doing phenomenal work, yes, but they're exceptions - most newsrooms still rely on advertising revenue that directly conflicts with investigative reporting needs.
Character 1: Okay but, hmm, subscription models are, sort of, taking off everywhere, you know? People are willing to pay!
434. So, subscription fatigue is, uhh, real though - the average person can't afford, I mean, twelve different news subscriptions, which, actually, creates information inequality between economic classes.
Character 1: That's why micropayments could change everything! Instant access, minimal friction!
435. Micropayment platforms have failed repeatedly since the 1990s because transaction costs exceed revenue, and readers hate the cognitive burden of constant small purchase decisions.
Character 1: But blockchain changes the economics completely!
436. Look, I wish [very sad] that were true, but blockchain journalism experiments like Civil collapsed because they solved technical problems nobody actually had while ignoring real distribution challenges.
Character 1: What about AI-assisted fact-checking? That's already working!
437. AI fact-checking tools [cough] are helpful for simple claims, but they struggle with context, nuance, and intentionally misleading partial truths that constitute most modern disinformation.
Character 1: Still, we're making [short pause] progress! The new, um, ethics guidelines from SPJ are, honestly, really comprehensive, right?
438. Guidelines are great but, er, enforcement is nonexistent - there's no, like, licensing body or meaningful consequences for violations, so it's basically, self-regulation theater.
Character 1: Hmm, maybe we need, sort of, a journalism council like, uhh, what Britain has, you know?
439. Britain's press councils are, well, largely toothless - Leveson Inquiry recommended, um, statutory backing but [laugh] newspapers successfully lobbied against any real accountability measures.
Character 1: There has to be something that works! What about crowdsourced verification?
440. Crowdsourcing has potential, but [curious] I'm wondering - how do we prevent it from becoming another vector for coordinated manipulation campaigns like we've seen with Wikipedia editing wars?
Character 1: So, um, you're really going to, like, lecture me about this again, I guess?
441. I'm not trying to lecture you - I just thought we could discuss why you've been missing so many meetings lately and figure out what's going on.
Character 1: Well, the thing is, I don't really, er, see the point anymore, you know?
442. Look, I understand that things might seem [overly polite] repetitive sometimes, but these sessions really do help people work through their challenges when they give them a proper chance.
Character 1: Whatever. It's all the same recycled advice anyway.
443. Actually, I think you'd be, hmm, [over confidently] surprised by how much progress you could make if you, well, stopped assuming you already know everything, honestly.
Character 1: Right so, you think I'm just, uh, being difficult for no reason, basically?
444. Not at all - I think you're [bored] protecting yourself from having to be vulnerable, which makes complete sense given what you've been through this year.
Character 1: You don't know anything about what I've been through.
445. You're right that I don't know everything, but I do know you lost your job three months ago and haven't told your family yet because you're worried about disappointing them.
Character 1: That's none of your [frustrated] business. How did you even find that out?
446. You told me yourself during our second session, though you were pretty upset at the time so I'm not surprised you might not remember all the details we discussed.
Character 1: I don't remember saying any of that.
447. Memory can be, well, tricky when we're under stress, and I mean, you've been carrying this burden alone for, actually, quite a while now, you know?
Character 1: This is [sniffle] pointless. I should just leave.
448. Before you go, let me just, err, [sneeze] excuse me - sorry about that - anyway, I wanted to say that, honestly, walking away won't make these problems disappear, you know?
Character 1: So what, I should just, um, sit here and, like, pretend this is helping, basically?
449. No, but maybe we could, well, try a different approach - instead of talking about feelings, we could focus on, I mean, practical steps for your job search, actually.
Character 1: That's just another waste of time.
450. I hear that you're frustrated, and, um, it makes sense that you'd feel that way, but honestly, giving up now means all the work you've done so far, well, won't have a chance to pay off.
Character 1: My doctor says I should try antidepressants but I just— I don't know if I'm ready for that.
451. I understand your hesitation, and it's [formal] completely normal to have concerns about medication - many people feel uncertain when they're first considering this option for managing their depression.
Character 1: But like, what if they, um, change who I am, you know, fundamentally?
452. So, that's actually a really common fear, and, well, the truth is that antidepressants don't, I mean, change your core personality - they're designed to help restore the chemical balance that depression disrupts.
Character 1: Yeah but my cousin said they made her feel like a zombie.
453. Honestly, everyone's brain chemistry is, er, different, and while some people do experience that flat feeling initially, you know, there are many different medications and dosages we can, actually, try to find what works for you.
Character 1: Oh great, so I'm basically a, [belly laugh], um, guinea pig now, right so, just experimenting on myself?
454. I know it can, well, feel that way, but really, finding the right treatment is more like, uhh, tailoring a suit - we make adjustments until we find what fits you specifically, you know?
Character 1: I guess that's, hmm, one way to look at it, but like, how long does this whole, er, process take?
455. Typically it takes about four to six weeks to see the full effects of an antidepressant, though some people notice subtle changes in their sleep or appetite patterns within the first two weeks.
Character 1: Four to six WEEKS? That's forever when you feel like this.
456. I hear you - when you're struggling with depression, even getting through a single day can feel overwhelming, and waiting weeks for relief sounds impossibly long right now.
Character 1: Plus, um, what about all those, you know, side effects they list, like, the scary ones?
457. Right so, the side effects list can be, actually, pretty intimidating, but here's the thing - most people experience mild side effects if any, and, well, they often improve as your body adjusts.
Character 1: But what if I'm one of the unlucky ones?
458. That's why we start with low doses and monitor closely - if something doesn't feel right, we can always stop or switch medications, and I'll be checking in with you regularly throughout the process.
Character 1: It's just that, hmm, I've tried so many things already and, basically, nothing works, so, why would this be different?
459. Depression can make us feel hopeless about treatment, but the fact that you're still here, still trying, still having this conversation - that shows incredible strength, even if you can't feel it right now.
Character 1: Oh please, spare me the [mocking] motivational poster wisdom.
460. Okay so, you're right, that was, uhh, a bit much - but honestly, the statistics show that most people do find relief with treatment, even if it takes, well, trying a few different approaches.
Character 1: My doctor says I should try antidepressants and honestly I'm [flirtatious] totally ready to become the best version of myself.
461. That's great that you're open to treatment, though I'm [sad] a bit concerned you might be expecting instant dramatic results - antidepressants work more gradually than people sometimes think.
Character 1: Oh please, I know exactly how they work - I've done my research.
462. Well, I appreciate that you've, um, done some reading, but [condescending] actually, there's quite a bit of nuance to how these medications interact with, you know, individual brain chemistry that articles don't always capture.
Character 1: Trust me, my brain chemistry is exceptional - I'll probably respond better than most people.
463. So, confidence is great, but honestly, even people with, er, the best attitudes can experience unexpected reactions, and it's just that we need to stay realistic about the timeline.
Character 1: Timeline schmimeline - I bet I'll feel amazing within a week.
464. Actually, that kind of immediate euphoria would, uhh, be concerning because, well, it could indicate a manic response rather than the gradual mood stabilization we're looking for, you know?
Character 1: Manic? No no, I mean, I'm just naturally, hmm, energetic and like, optimistic about this whole thing.
465. Right, and maintaining optimism is helpful, but I want to make sure you understand that most people need four to six weeks to see real therapeutic effects, and rushing the process can be counterproductive.
Character 1: Four to six weeks is nothing - I once trained for a marathon in three weeks.
466. That's, err, quite impressive, but here's the thing - brain chemistry isn't like, basically, muscle conditioning, and pushing harder doesn't make antidepressants work faster.
Character 1: Whatever, I'm sure I'll be, um, one of those people who responds, you know, super quickly anyway.
467. I hope you do respond well, but actually, the people who have the most success are those who, kind of, approach this with patience and, well, realistic expectations about the process.
Character 1: Look, I'm [enunciating every word] going to, uhh, absolutely crush this depression thing, like, once and for all, honestly.
468. Your enthusiasm is [delighted] wonderful and, I mean, having a positive outlook can definitely help, but remember that, actually, treating depression is more marathon than sprint, right so?
Character 1: Fine fine, but like, when I do beat this, er, faster than expected, I want you to, basically, admit I was right.
469. Deal - and if you do respond exceptionally well, I'll be the first to celebrate with you, though I still want you to check in regularly about any changes you notice.
Character 1: Oh I'll be checking in alright - mostly to brag about how great I feel.
470. Perfect, I look forward to those check-ins, and remember that even if things don't go exactly as planned, we have plenty of options to explore together.
Character 1: I can't leave this room, the door won't open and I've been trying for hours now, pushing and pulling and nothing's working at all.
471. Okay, um, let's stay calm and [whispering] figure this out together, you know, because sometimes these old doors just need a specific technique or maybe the humidity has made the wood swell up.
Character 1: I'm telling you I've tried [whispering loudly] everything, I've twisted the knob both ways, shouldered it, kicked it, even tried using a credit card on the latch.
472. Have you checked if maybe there's a deadbolt you forgot about, or sometimes these older buildings have those weird double-lock mechanisms that need you to lift the handle while turning?
Character 1: There's no deadbolt, just the regular knob, and er, [clearing throat] I'm actually starting to feel kind of claustrophobic in here, like the walls are getting closer.
473. Well, that sounds really frightening, and I mean, being stuck anywhere can trigger those feelings, but basically we need to focus on practical solutions right now to get you out safely.
Character 1: What if, uh, nobody finds me for days, like, what if I'm honestly stuck here until Monday when people come back to work?
474. So, let's think rationally here - uhh, you have your phone obviously since we're talking, and the thing is, worst case scenario we can always call building maintenance or even emergency services if needed.
Character 1: My phone battery is at twelve percent though, and hmm, I guess I'm sort of panicking because the charger is in my car.
475. Err, that's definitely not ideal, but anyway, let's work quickly then - it's just that we need to prioritize getting help before your battery dies completely.
Character 1: The window won't open either, ah, it's painted shut or something, and you know, I really tried forcing it but it's completely sealed.
476. Actually, painted windows are common in older buildings, and umm, here's the thing - sometimes you can break that seal by tapping along the edges with something hard.
Character 1: Oh wait, I hear footsteps outside, like someone's walking down the hall, I mean, should I basically start screaming for help?
477. Well, absolutely yes, start calling out now, and honestly, bang on the door too - kind of make as much noise as possible to get their attention immediately.
Character 1: They're gone, they just walked right past even though I was yelling and pounding on the door with both fists.
478. So that's really strange, but err, [relieved] at least we know people are in the building, and actually this means someone will definitely be back through that hallway eventually.
Character 1: I'm getting so tired from all this, [sleepily] my arms hurt from hitting the door and I just want to sit down and give up.
479. No no no, you absolutely [shouting] cannot give up now, because we're going to get you out of there, and I need you to stay focused and keep trying different things!
Character 1: Maybe I should, um, try to take the door off its hinges, like, the pins look basically accessible from this side.
480. That's actually a brilliant idea, and if you have anything flat like a butter knife or screwdriver, you can [short pause] tap those hinge pins up and out from the bottom.
Character 1: [explosive] You took those photos at a, [furious], private rehabilitation facility where people are supposed to be, [shaking], safe from vultures like you who profit from their, [bitter], lowest moments.
481. Look, um, I was hired to document the, [defensive], facility's grounds for their new brochure and, well, I just happened to see your client, [uncomfortable], sneaking out to meet their dealer in the parking lot, so, [firm], what was I supposed to do?
Character 1: [seething] Oh, so you just, um, happened to have your telephoto lens ready and, I mean, you just happened to follow them for, [sarcastic], forty minutes taking hundreds of shots while they were, well, clearly struggling with their recovery? [laughs bitterly]
482. [measured] Listen, uh, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, um, when someone claiming sobriety is actually, [serious], meeting dealers while their family thinks they're getting better, well, that's news the public, [resolute], deserves to know about.
Character 1: [cold] You're disgusting.
483. [frustrated] Right, well, I mean, I'm disgusting for exposing the truth while you're, [accusatory], paid six figures to cover up lies and, um, manipulate the public into believing whatever narrative, [harsh], protects your client's brand, right?
Character 1: [trembling] My client is a human being who's, um, [breaking], fighting an addiction that nearly killed them twice, and, well, deserves privacy while they heal. [sighs heavily]
484. [firm] Your client is a senator who, um, voted for mandatory minimums that put addicts in prison while, well, [angry], secretly getting private treatment that costs more than most people, [bitter], make in a year.
Character 1: The hypocrisy doesn't justify, [desperate], violating someone's medical privacy when they're at their most, [cracking], vulnerable trying to get clean.
485. [quiet] Look, I mean, I haven't sold the photos yet and, um, honestly I've been, [conflicted], sitting on them for three days trying to decide if, well, [exhausted], this crosses a line even for someone like me.
Character 1: [stunned] Wait, you haven't—you're telling me those photos aren't, [hopeful], already splashed across every tabloid website and trending on, [urgent], social media?
486. No, um, they're still on my, [hesitant], memory card sitting in my apartment safe, I mean, untouched.
Character 1: Then why did you call me here at, [confused], midnight threatening to destroy everything I've worked to build if you're not even, [searching], sure you want to release them? [pause]
487. [soft] Because twenty years ago I was the one, [vulnerable], checking into that same facility while my ex-wife leaked photos of me at rock, [pained], bottom to win our custody battle.
Character 1: [gentle] Jesus, I had no idea you'd been through, [sympathetic], that kind of public humiliation yourself.
488. [weary] Yeah well, um, that's why I called you first instead of, I mean, [conflicted], my editor, because maybe there's another way to handle this that doesn't, [tired], destroy someone who's genuinely trying to get better.
Character 1: What if we could work out something where the senator, [calculating], publicly supports addiction treatment reform without anyone knowing about the, [careful], photos you took?
489. You mean, like, use the photos as leverage to, [thoughtful], force them into actually helping people instead of, well, [considering], just protecting their career?
Character 1: [determined] I think we both know that real change happens when people with, [intense], power have personal stakes in the outcome, so, um, maybe this is how we, well, turn a violation into something meaningful. [exhales slowly]
490. [resolved] Alright, well, I mean, let's figure out how to make this senator's, [purposeful], recovery journey actually mean something for the thousands of addicts they've been, um, happy to throw in prison while secretly getting, [bitter], help themselves.
Character 1: [stunned] The serial number on this panel is, [recognizing], Dad's old registration from when he captained this ship thirty years, [voice breaking], ago.
491. You're not supposed to be, [defensive], here checking those alarms until Thursday when I'm, [uncomfortable], scheduled for shore leave.
Character 1: [trembling] Well, um, they called me in early because, [confused], the system's been malfunctioning, and I mean, here you are. [pause]
492. [bitter] Of course they'd send you, [sarcastic], the golden child who inherited all of Dad's technical genius while I got stuck with his, [trailing off], stubborn streak.
Character 1: [gentle] Listen, um, I didn't know you were working on the Meridian, I mean, [careful], after you left eight years ago without a word, well, [voice cracking], I never thought I'd see you again, especially not, [broken], here on his ship.
493. [softening] Every morning I walk these, [nostalgic], same corridors where he taught us to tie knots, where he, [emotional], showed us how to read the stars, where we were actually, [whispered], a family once.
Character 1: [precise] Um, the fire suppression system in the engine room, well, [technical], it's using the same configuration Dad designed, you know.
494. [surprised] Wait, um, they never upgraded it after all these, [amazed], years? [chuckles]
Character 1: [warm] Well, why fix something that works perfectly, I mean, [proud], just like he always said. [sighs]
495. [awakening] You know, um, I've been maintaining that system myself for, [realizing], three years now without knowing it was, I mean, [overwhelmed], his design keeping everyone safe, like, [tearful], he's still watching over this crew.
Character 1: [steady] Er, maybe we could grab coffee after I finish the, [hopeful], inspection, you know, like we used to.
496. [cautious] The galley still serves that terrible instant coffee he, [amused], pretended to love because real coffee was too expensive for a working, [remembering], captain with two kids to feed. [laughs softly]
Character 1: [comforting] Well, um, I brought a thermos of the good stuff from that place downtown, I mean, [inviting], enough for two if you've got time. [pause]
497. Time is all I have between, [resigned], watches on this floating reminder of everything we lost.
Character 1: [determined] We didn't lose everything though, [firm], we lost him but we still have this ship, these memories, and, [vulnerable], maybe each other if we're brave enough.
498. [breaking] Um, I spent eight years running from this, well, [struggling], from you, from every reminder of how much it hurt when he died and, I mean, [raw], left us with nothing but his blueprints and this, er, [gesturing], rusted sanctuary.
Character 1: [gentle] Well, you know, he also left us with his stubbornness and, um, [smiling], his talent for fixing things that seem broken beyond, [meaningful], repair.
499. [awakening] Like, um, maybe he knew we'd both end up back here somehow, I mean, [wondering], working on his systems, walking his routes, and well, [hopeful], finding our way back to each other. [long pause]
Character 1: [precise] Um, the inspection will take exactly two hours, then, well, [reaching out], we have all the time we need to figure out what, er, [voice cracking], comes next.
500. [whispered] Well, um, okay.
Character 1: [gentle] So, um, I know you've been calling yourself, [careful], an omega and I mean, that tells me you've, [concerned], internalized something pretty painful about, well, your place in the world.
501. [defensive] Everyone else decided that, [bitter], long before I did—I just finally accepted it.
Character 1: [thoughtful] Well, you know, acceptance can be, [pause], a starting point rather than an ending, I mean, if we reframe it right.
502. That sounds like the kind of thing people, [skeptical], say when they've never been at the bottom.
Character 1: I spent three years homeless after my divorce, [quietly], sleeping in my car and showering at the gym.
503. [surprised] You were, um, actually homeless and now you're, [stunned], sitting here in this nice office telling me, well, things can get better?
Character 1: [earnest] Not just better—completely, [emphatic], transformed if you're willing to do the, [steady], work.
504. I mean, the work sounds great in theory but, [exhausted], nobody wants to hire an omega, you know?
Character 1: [firm] That word you keep using is a, [deliberate], prison you've built for yourself, and prisons, [knowing], can be escaped if you understand their, [intense], architecture.
505. [curious] So, um, you're saying I, well, built this myself rather than, [uncertain], having it forced on me by everyone else?
Character 1: [compassionate] I'm saying that, um, other people may have handed you the, [careful], materials but you're the one who, well, assembled them into walls, and that means, [hopeful], you have the power to take them down.
506. [vulnerable] Nobody's ever suggested I had, [trembling], any power before.
Character 1: [warm] Well, that's because most people benefit from, [knowing], keeping omegas exactly where they are, I mean.
507. [angry] Exactly! So, um, why should I believe you're any, [suspicious], different when you're getting paid to, well, fix me or whatever this is supposed to be?
Character 1: Because I'm not trying to fix you—you're not, [emphatic], broken, you're just convinced you are, and there's a, [meaningful], massive difference between those two states of, [deliberate], being.
508. [shaky] I mean, if I'm not broken then, [confused], why does everyone treat me like I am, you know?
Character 1: [direct] Because, well, broken people are easier to, [harsh], control than whole ones, um.
509. [quiet] That's the first thing you've, [recognition], said that actually makes sense.
Character 1: [encouraging] Good, so, I mean, let's start there with what, [focused], makes sense to you.
510. Starting means, well, I'd have to believe there's somewhere to, [hesitant], go from here, and um, I'm not sure I can do that yet. [long pause]
Character 1: [stunned] I can see you through the glass arranging those, [hollow], mannequins like nothing happened between us all these years.
511. [cold] Well, um, I didn't expect to see you, [defensive], outside my store looking like, er, you've been living rough, and I mean, [uncomfortable], this isn't exactly the reunion either of us wanted, you know?
Character 1: [bitter] Um, yeah, well, being your father's dirty secret didn't exactly, [sarcastic], set me up for success, and I mean, [quieter], watching you inherit everything while I got nothing wasn't great either.
512. [firm] That wasn't my, [frustrated], fault and you know it. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [desperate] No, but you could have, [accusatory], acknowledged I existed instead of pretending I was, [voice breaking], invisible at his funeral when everyone knew exactly who I, [trailing off], was.
513. [defensive] My mother was, [ashamed], grieving and seeing you there would have, [tense], destroyed her even more than his betrayal already, [quieter], had.
Character 1: [angry] So I had to grieve alone in the, [shaking], parking lot while you all played perfect family inside the, [disgusted], church. [laughs bitterly]
514. [uncomfortable] Look, I have customers coming soon and I can't have you, [nervous], standing outside my window looking like, [harsh], this because it's bad for, [trailing], business.
Character 1: [hurt] Right, because your precious window displays matter more than the fact that I'm, [broken], sleeping in the park three blocks from here while you're, [bitter], arranging designer handbags.
515. [conflicted] That's not what I, [guilty], meant but this job is all I have left after the estate, [exhausted], taxes took everything and mom's medical bills ate the, [defeated], rest. [long pause]
Character 1: [shocked] Wait, um, you mean you're not, [confused], rich anymore?
516. [resigned] Um, no, I've been, [embarrassed], barely keeping this job for six months and, well, [vulnerable], living in the stockroom after hours because I can't afford rent, you know, so maybe we're not so, [quietly], different anymore.
Character 1: [softer] God, he really screwed us both over in the end by keeping, [disbelief], everything tangled up in legal battles and, [tired], debt that neither of us could escape from, [hollow], didn't he?
517. The lawyers got, [bitter], everything while we got abandoned by a dead man's lies.
Character 1: [exhausted] At least you have a stockroom to sleep in and not just, [envious], cardboard and newspapers like I've been using for the past, [defeated], three months.
518. There's a cot in the back behind the, [hesitant], mannequin storage if you need somewhere dry tonight but we can't, [warning], make it a regular thing. [sighs]
Character 1: [surprised] Um, wait, are you actually, [emotional], offering to help me after, well, [disbelief], everything that happened between us, I mean, all the resentment and anger we've been carrying?
519. [quiet] Maybe hating each other won't bring him back to, [weary], fix what he broke in both our lives.
Character 1: [tearful] I spent so many years blaming you for having what I, [choked up], couldn't have but now I see you're just as, [broken], lost as I am.
520. [gentle] Well, um, come around back before the mall security, [resigned], does their rounds, er, and maybe we can figure out how to, you know, [hopeful], survive this mess together.
Character 1: [heavy] The numbers are all here but they feel, [hollow], like we're weighing souls against kilowatts and I can't make them balance anymore.
521. [quiet] I know.
Character 1: [tense] Three hundred jobs versus our commitment to, [breaking], go carbon neutral by 2030—how did we let it get to this, [defeated], impossible choice? [sighs]
522. [whispered] Um, well, I don't know. [pause]
Character 1: [frustrated] Every meeting we've had for six months has been dancing around this, [exhausted], pretending there was some magical third option that would, [bitter], save us from having to decide. [laughs darkly]
523. You know, um, the thing is, I've been running, [trembling], these models every night for weeks and, well, they all say the same thing. [long pause]
Character 1: [desperate] Tell me there's something we missed, some way to make the factory work with, [pleading], our renewable targets that doesn't involve lying to everyone about the emissions data.
524. [defeated] I mean, umm, we could offset with credits but that's just, [disgusted], moving the pollution somewhere else and pretending it doesn't, [hollow], exist while families here go hungry without those jobs, you know? [groans]
Character 1: [anguished] So, um, either I betray the workers who've been begging me for, [voice cracking], any opportunity to feed their kids or I betray the planet their kids will, [broken], inherit—God, I mean, how is that even a choice? [crying]
525. [barely audible] Um, it's not, really.
Character 1: [weary] You know, Sarah's daughter has asthma and she still called me yesterday begging, um, practically begging for us to approve this factory because, [bitter], her unemployment runs out next month and, well, what do I tell her?
526. The board meeting is tomorrow at nine and, um, they'll want our, [dread], recommendation—unified, professional, like we haven't been tearing ourselves apart over this, you know? [exhales sharply]
Character 1: [resigned] Twenty years I've worked to bring opportunity to this town and now, [empty], everything feels like a betrayal.
527. We both know what we're going to recommend even though it, [guilty], feels like signing a death warrant either way, don't we?
Character 1: [determined] I'll draft the approval with every environmental safeguard we can legally require, um, knowing full well they won't be, [defeated], enough but at least we can say we, like, tried.
528. [firm] Make it clear.
Character 1: The factory opens in spring and by summer the river will start to, [sickened], smell different and the sunrise will have that industrial haze but three hundred families will, [conflicted], have health insurance and groceries and maybe that's all we can, I mean, manage right now.
529. [soft] Maybe that's enough.
Character 1: [haunted] We'll sit in this same room five years from now looking at cancer rates and, [prophetic], respiratory illness statistics and remember this exact moment when we chose economics over, [breaking], ecology.
530. [whispered] And we'll also remember the thank-you cards from families who could finally, [bittersweet], afford Christmas presents. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: That's a 1962 Fender Rhodes you're, [hollow], spray-painting silver for tomorrow's scene, the exact model my mentor, [stunned], played until he died last year.
531. [detached] Well, um, the director wanted something that looked, [indifferent], authentic for the bar scene, so I mean, I grabbed whatever was, [shrugging], sitting around in storage, you know.
Character 1: [trembling] Um, these aren't just props, I mean they're, [breaking], real instruments worth thousands that someone donated thinking they'd be preserved, not destroyed.
532. [casual] My job description says acquire and maintain, [dismissive], props for production, not preserve some dusty, [cold], museum pieces nobody even looks at. [scoffs]
Character 1: I've been restoring that Rhodes for, um, three months during my lunch breaks because, well, it reminded me of watching him, [voice cracking], play jazz standards after everyone else went home, you know. [exhales sharply]
533. Nobody told me the keyboard tech had, [annoyed], emotional attachments to random equipment that's been, [frustrated], collecting dust in the prop warehouse for, [trailing off], who knows how long. [sighs]
Character 1: Every scratch you make destroys decades of, [anguished], history that can't be replaced, history that actually, [desperate], matters to some of us.
534. [defensive] Look, I've got seventeen scenes to prep by morning and, [overwhelmed], the production doesn't care about your, [bitter], sentimental value when they need, [exhausted], authentic-looking instruments on set. [groans]
Character 1: [quietly] You know, um, I used to think this job meant something, like we were, [lost], preserving art or culture or, well, I don't know, something that, [hollow], mattered beyond next week's shoot.
535. [flat] Um, well, it doesn't.
Character 1: Maybe that's the problem with all of us here, um, we've forgotten why we started caring about, [empty], instruments and music in the first place, you know. [laughs bitterly]
536. [awakening] I used to play piano before I, um, [remembering], became this.
Character 1: Then you should understand that destroying these instruments is, well, like burning sheet music or, [pained], erasing recordings that can't be recreated, you know. [whispers]
537. [softening] The production budget keeps shrinking and they expect me to, [tired], create magic from nothing while real instruments sit there, [conflicted], begging to be used even if it, [quiet], means destroying them.
Character 1: [resigned] Well, I mean, I guess we're both just, [defeated], cogs in a machine that doesn't care about preservation anymore, um, only next quarter's profit margin.
538. [distant] Sometimes I walk through the warehouse at night and, um, I can almost hear what these instruments, [wistful], used to sound like before they became, well, just props in someone else's, [fading], story. [long pause]
Character 1: [gently] That Rhodes still works perfectly underneath the paint if you, [hopeful], want to hear it play one more time before it's completely, [breaking], gone forever. [voice cracks]
539. [contemplating] Maybe after everyone leaves tonight we could, [uncertain], plug it in and remember why any of this, [searching], used to matter to people like, [quiet], us.
Character 1: I still have his sheet music in my locker, um, the standards he loved playing, and well, maybe hearing them again would, [longing], wake something up in both of us, you know. [sighs deeply]
540. Twenty years in props and I've never, [realizing], actually played any of the instruments I've been, [ashamed], destroying all this time until they became, [broken], worthless. [trails off]
Character 1: This is a Zenith Space Command 600, [stunned], haven't seen one of these in working condition for, [quiet], must be thirty years at least.
541. [defensive] It's been in my family since 1972, and it worked perfectly fine until last week when the, [frustrated], picture started rolling and making this awful buzzing sound.
Character 1: [soft] My father used to, um, repair these exact models in his shop, I mean, he'd spend hours on them, well, said they were built to last generations.
542. [curious] Really?
Character 1: [wistful] He had dozens of service manuals for Zenith sets stacked in our garage, [trailing off], used to make me help him sort capacitors on weekends.
543. Most repair people these days just, [dismissive], tell me to throw it away and buy something new, you know, like it's just garbage. [scoffs]
Character 1: [bitter] Yeah, that's because they don't understand that these old sets were, [reverent], actual craftsmanship, not the disposable junk they make now where everything's designed to, [angry], break after the warranty expires.
544. [thoughtful] You sound like you actually care about more than just, [hopeful], collecting a service fee and leaving. [sighs]
Character 1: The thing is, um, after my dad passed last year, well, I promised myself I'd, [breaking], treat every vintage set like he would have, you know, with actual respect.
545. [gentle] Well, um, I'm sorry.
Character 1: [measured] Look, I know this might sound strange but, um, would you mind if I, [hesitant], took a bit longer with this repair, I mean, just to do it properly? [pause]
546. [warm] My husband watched the moon landing on this TV, and our kids grew up with Saturday morning, [nostalgic], cartoons on it, so I mean, take all the time you need to, [earnest], bring it back to life properly, you know. [smiles]
Character 1: [grateful] You know, um, that's exactly what my father would have wanted to hear, I mean, that these machines still, [emotional], matter to people beyond just being appliances. [exhales]
547. [firm] Well, they're not just machines, um, they're vessels for memories, aren't they, [reflective], I mean that's what makes them worth saving.
Character 1: The flyback transformer is probably failing which is why you're getting that, [technical], high-pitched whine along with the rolling picture. [pause]
548. [interested] So, um, can you actually fix something like that, or well, is it one of those parts that, [worried], nobody makes anymore, you know?
Character 1: [confident] My father left me crates full of new-old-stock parts, including at least, [proud], three flyback transformers that'll fit this model perfectly, so yeah, [determined], we can absolutely save this beautiful machine.
549. That's the first time anyone's called this old TV, [touched], beautiful in probably twenty years, most people just see, [sad], an eyesore taking up space.
Character 1: [passionate] Well, um, they're wrong.
550. [sincere] Your father taught you well, and I think he'd be, [emotional], proud to see you carrying on his work like this.
Character 1: [stunned] So this is what, [cold], five years of silence comes to—you sitting across from me as, [bitter], my newest probation assignment.
551. [defensive] Um, well, hi.
Character 1: [controlled] You know, um, I have to treat you like any other case which means, [measured], weekly check-ins and drug tests even though we both know, [sharp], that's not your problem, er, is it?
552. My problem was trusting the wrong, [disgusted], people at that company—something you'd understand if you ever bothered to listen.
Character 1: [dismissive] Right, um, because it's always someone else's fault like when you, [sarcastic], embezzled Dad's retirement fund to start your, [mocking], brilliant consulting firm, I mean, that was other people too?
553. [furious] That was completely different and you, [venomous], know it—I paid him back every penny with, [trembling], interest before the cancer even, [voice cracking], started.
Character 1: Well, you can't pay back the two years of, [harsh], prison time you're facing if you violate these terms, um, so maybe for once in your life, er, you should follow the rules. [laughs bitterly]
554. [quiet] Fine.
Character 1: [professional] So, um, let's go through your employment situation because the court says you can't work in, [careful], financial analysis anymore which basically makes your entire, [pointed], career worthless, doesn't it? [sighs]
555. [defensive] I have seventeen years of experience reading, [frustrated], consumer behavior patterns which translates to plenty of other fields that don't involve, [exhausted], handling money directly—retail strategy, [trailing off], marketing research, product development.
Character 1: [skeptical] Uh, except every employer will run a background check and see, [deliberate], corporate fraud conviction which, I mean, tends to make them, [cynical], nervous about hiring someone who analyzes data for, well, a living, you know?
556. [desperate] Well, um, there has to be something because I can't just, [breaking], sit around doing nothing. [voice cracks]
Character 1: There's a warehouse job that takes felons—minimum wage but it meets your, [cold], employment requirement and keeps you busy enough to, [flat], stay out of trouble.
557. [incredulous] You're seriously suggesting I go from analyzing, [bitter], billion-dollar market trends to stacking boxes in some, [defeated], warehouse like I'm nothing?
Character 1: [firm] I'm suggesting you take what's available because your, [harsh], choices put you here and my job isn't to coddle your, [ice-cold], bruised ego about falling from grace.
558. Your job is to help with rehabilitation not to, [resentful], punish me for our family history. [scoffs]
Character 1: [clinical] My personal feelings don't factor into your, [detached], case management regardless of our, [mechanical], shared DNA.
559. [wounded] God, you really did turn into Dad—same righteous, [disgusted], disappointment in your voice.
Character 1: Um, well, at least Dad never got arrested for, [cutting], fraud so maybe his disappointment was, [vicious], justified after all, you know? [exhales sharply]
560. [defeated] I mean, just give me the forms to sign so, [exhausted], we can both pretend this is just, [hollow], business and nothing more, um, like we've been doing for years anyway. [sighs heavily]
Character 1: [urgent] We've got debris from the Kosmos-2589 entering atmosphere, [steady], seventeen minutes earlier than projected and the trajectory shows impact, [tense], zone directly over your main distribution hub.
561. [controlled] Well, um, I need exact coordinates because, [calculating], we're talking about potentially cascading sixty thousand households into blackout if we, I mean, don't reroute the load properly, you know.
Character 1: The current vector puts it at, [focused], thirty-seven point four degrees north by eighty-two point one west but, umm, atmospheric drag is shifting it, like, two kilometers every recalculation so we need to, well, work fast here.
562. That's directly over, [alarmed], Substation Seven which feeds the hospital district and if we lose that transformer, [grim], we're looking at backup generators for three trauma centers during, [quieter], peak emergency hours. [exhales sharply]
Character 1: [firm] I can adjust the guidance telemetry from here to push the debris, [determined], field about four kilometers east but I need you to kill power to sectors, [quick], twelve through fifteen for ninety seconds. [pauses]
563. [hesitant] Ninety seconds means emergency lighting only in two nursing homes and, [worried], that's assuming their backup systems engage properly.
Character 1: [measured] The alternative is molten satellite fragments hitting live transformers at, [grave], terminal velocity.
564. [resigned] Give me forty-five seconds to notify emergency services while I'm, [typing frantically], initiating the shutdown sequence because this is going to light up every, [tense], alarm board from here to downtown.
Character 1: We're now at T-minus eleven minutes and the debris field is, [urgent], starting to fragment which means multiple impact points.
565. [focused] Alright, um, I'm cutting power to sectors twelve and thirteen now but, well, fourteen has a surgical team mid-operation so I need to, like, route auxiliary power through the, [quick], west loop first which will take another, umm, twenty seconds. [breathing hard]
Character 1: [tense] I'm seeing increased ionization in the upper atmosphere which could, [worried], trigger electromagnetic pulses if the larger fragments hit your transmission lines while they're still, [strained], energized.
566. [sharp] Look, I mean, I'm working as fast as the system allows but, um, these grids weren't designed for, [frustrated], emergency shutdowns based on falling space junk, you know.
Character 1: [calm] Well, um, I understand the pressure but we need sector fourteen dark in, like, thirty seconds or we risk a cascade failure.
567. [determined] Sector fourteen going dark in ten, nine—wait, um, there's a NICU ward on that grid that wasn't, well, flagged in my system and they're reporting, [panicked], thirty-two premature infants on life support.
Character 1: [urgent] Can you isolate just that building because, um, the main debris mass is now showing, [strained], six minutes to impact and I'm losing my window to, like, deflect it away from your primary infrastructure, [desperate], which means we need a decision now, I mean, right now.
568. [quick] Isolating the NICU building now and, um, dropping everything else—sectors going dark in, well, five, four, three—
Character 1: [intense] Firing lateral thrusters now to push the debris east and I'm seeing, [hopeful], trajectory shift of two point seven kilometers which should clear your, um, main hub but we'll have impacts in the industrial district instead, [relieved], where you've got minimal infrastructure, right? [sighs heavily]
569. [steady] Industrial district can handle it because those substations are, [confident], hardened for manufacturing surges and we've got redundancy there plus the fragments should hit mostly, [calculating], parking lots and warehouses at this hour.
Character 1: [exhausted] Debris entering final descent phase now and telemetry shows we've successfully, [relieved], diverted from critical infrastructure with impact in T-minus ninety seconds to the, [quieter], industrial zone as planned. [long exhale]
570. [grateful] Grid's stable and all critical facilities maintained power through the shutdown so I'd say, [lighter], we just pulled off a minor miracle here.
Character 1: [stunned] Dad?
571. [defensive] Well, um, I didn't expect, [avoiding eye contact], to see you here of all places, uh, especially not after, [bitter], what, three years now since you, [voice cracking], stopped returning my calls.
Character 1: [trembling] I can't believe you're, um, working here now when you, [struggling], always said retail was beneath you, I mean, after everything. [sighs heavily]
572. [resigned] Things change when you lose, [quietly], everything at sixty-eight, when the business goes under and, [ashamed], your wife leaves and suddenly, [breaking], nobody wants to hire an old fool.
Character 1: You could have called me instead of, [tearful], disappearing like that, instead of just, [frustrated], letting pride destroy what little family we had left.
573. [defiant] Pride was all I had left after, [voice shaking], watching everything I built crumble while my own daughter, [accusatory], judged every decision I made. [laughs bitterly]
Character 1: [hurt] I wasn't judging, um, I was trying to, [pleading], help you see that the gambling was, uh, destroying more than just, [desperate], your bank account, Dad, it was destroying us. [voice breaks]
574. [softer] Maybe you're right about the gambling, [regretful], but what good does being right do us now?
Character 1: [hopeful] Well, um, we're both here now, [cautious], aren't we, talking for the first time in years?
575. [vulnerable] I watch you on the news sometimes when they, [proud], interview you about elder care, and I think about how, [wistful], successful you became despite having me as, [self-deprecating], a father. [voice wavers]
Character 1: [emotional] You were a good father once, um, before the addiction took over, [remembering], and I became a geriatrician because, well, I watched you care for Grandma. [crying softly]
576. [surprised] You remember that? I thought you were, [touched], too young when she passed, but you actually, [overwhelmed], remember how I used to read to her every, [choking up], night? [sniffles]
Character 1: [gentle] Of course I remember, Dad, um, and I tell my patients' families about it, you know, all the time.
577. The man who read to his mother is still, [searching], here somewhere, just buried under mistakes and regret, I guess. [long pause]
Character 1: [determined] Then let's find him again because I specialize in, [passionate], helping people reclaim their lives, no matter their age, [firm], and you taught me that everyone, [intense], deserves dignity and care.
578. [hesitant] Would you really want to try again with, [ashamed], someone who failed you so completely?
Character 1: [tender] I treat patients every day who've lost, [compassionate], everything and still find ways to rebuild. [sighs]
579. [grateful] Maybe we could start with coffee after, [nervous], my shift ends today if you have time? [hopeful pause]
Character 1: [warm] I have all the time in the world for, [relieved], my dad, especially now that I've finally, [joyful], found him again. [tears falling]
580. [crying] Thank you, um, sweetheart, I mean, I don't deserve this second chance but, [determined], I won't waste it this time. [voice firm]
581. [slowly] You know, um, when I first saw the pitch deck, I was like—honestly, another biotech startup, right? [pause] But then, er, something about the data just... I mean, the preclinical results were actually insane. [excited] Twenty-three patients with late-stage ALS showing motor function improvement—like, that's not supposed to happen! And I'm sitting there thinking, okay so, this could be real. [quietly] This could actually be real. 

The thing is, uh, I've structured, what, maybe fifty deals in healthcare? [sigh] Most of them are just—you know, incremental improvements, basically tax optimization plays dressed up as innovation. But this one... [warming up] I remember calling the lead researcher at like, hmm, two in the morning because I couldn't stop reading the trial data. [laugh] My partners thought I was losing it—"it's just another deal, calm down."

[passionately] But it wasn't just another deal! We're talking about, I mean, kids who were basically given death sentences, and now they're—[voice breaking] sorry, it's just... [short pause] Anyway, um, when we closed the funding round last week, the researcher actually cried. [very quietly] And honestly, so did I. [confidently] Forty million dollars, and for once, I know—I absolutely know—it's going exactly where it needs to go.
582. [excited] They're calling me up for the award, the—the National Activist of the Year, can you believe it? [pause] God, I worked so hard for this, like, fifteen years of campaigns and protests and [proudly] changing actual laws. [short pause] Sarah should be here. [sad] She was supposed to—but we haven't talked since, um, since I missed her birthday for that conference. [regretful] Third birthday in a row, actually. [clearing throat] And Mom called yesterday, said she doesn't even recognize me anymore, [bitter] said I care more about strangers than my own family. [defensive] That's not—I mean, someone has to fight for these causes, right? [shaky voice] The kids I'm helping, they need someone who won't give up, who'll [passionately] dedicate everything to making change happen. [quietly] Everything. [long pause] Jake moved out last week. [crying while speaking] Said he couldn't compete with my mission anymore, said he felt like—like a ghost in his own home. [sniffle] They're announcing my name now, everyone's clapping, and I'm supposed to feel [hesitantly] proud? Accomplished? [very sad] I've saved so many families, but I couldn't save my own. [exhausted] How's that for irony?
583. [gasp softly] They actually—we won. I mean, holy shit, we actually won. [laugh] Three years since they, um, fired me for "raising safety concerns" and now—[bitter] now they have to pay eight million dollars because I was right. The defect I kept warning them about, you know, it hurt seventeen people. 

[pause] 

God, I still remember sitting in, like, that conference room while they basically told me I was being "alarmist." [angry] Tom sat there with his stupid smug face and said I didn't understand the bigger picture. Well, [triumphant] guess who understands the bigger picture now, Tom?

[sigh]

The thing is, uh, I didn't even want to be right about this. Those families who got hurt—[very sad] I mean, that's not—I tried to prevent exactly that. But they wouldn't listen, and honestly, [shaky voice] when the verdict came in, I just... 

[relieved] It's over. My first big case and it's against the people who, er, tried to destroy my career for doing the right thing. [chuckle] The partner at my firm said this was, like, "poetic justice" but really? [exhausted] I'm just glad those families got something. And maybe, [hopeful] maybe now companies will actually listen when someone raises a red flag.
584. [extremely happy] I just—I actually did it! Sarah starts Monday, she's, um, she's officially my first employee. [chuckle] God, that sounds so weird to say out loud, like, "my employee." [warm] After thirty years of being someone else's employee, you know, and now I'm—well, I'm the boss, I guess. [nervous] The thing is, er, when I started this little candle business after retiring, it was just supposed to be, honestly, something to keep me busy. [pause] But then orders started coming in and I couldn't—[overwhelmed] I mean, last week I was up until 3 AM pouring wax and, uh, my back was killing me. [laugh] My wife said, "Either hire help or I'm hiding your supplies!" [trailing off] So here we are and... [anxious] What if I mess this up? Like, what if I'm a terrible boss or, hmm, what if the business can't actually support—[short pause] No. [confidently] You know what? Sarah's great, she's really excited about the soaps and, um, the new lavender line we're planning. [very sincerely] This is real. My little retirement project is, well, it's becoming something actual. [emotionally] Something I built. [sniffle] Sorry, I just—[smiling speaking] wow. We're really doing this, aren't we?
585. Look at them. Just... [bitter] look at them, shredding everything like it's nothing. [pause] Three boxes already, and they're not even trying to hide it. I mean, [angry] these are people's lives they're destroying—medical records, harassment complaints, years of documentation. [shaky voice] My lawyer says we got lucky, um, that we filed when we did, but this isn't—[frustrated] God, how is this even legal? [long pause] They're literally burning evidence in the courtyard. [disgusted] In broad daylight, like they're having some kind of celebration. I won, [very quietly] I won my case, got everything I asked for, but watching this... [sigh] Sarah from accounting, she needed those timesheets for her overtime claim. [upset] Marcus had all his disability discrimination stuff in there—I saw his folder go into the shredder myself. [furious] Five years I gave them, and this is what they do? They settle with me and then, [bitterly] then they make sure nobody else can prove anything. [pause] My check cleared yesterday. Two hundred thousand. [very sad] But what about everyone else who's still fighting? [whispering] I should have warned them somehow, I should have—[trailing off] I don't know. [exhausted] Maybe I should film this. Actually, [anxious] what if they see me watching from here?
586. [extremely happy] I just signed the papers! Two years—two whole years of, like, eating ramen and skipping vacations, and it's actually happening. [shaky voice] My hands were literally shaking when I picked up the pen. You probably thought I was being dramatic, but um, this is everything I've been working toward. Remember when you first sat me down and showed me that spreadsheet? [laugh] I thought you were insane. "Save thirty percent of your income," you said, and I was like—there's no way. But you broke it down, week by week, and somehow... [warm] somehow you made it feel possible. 

[pause] I keep thinking about calling my mom. She never thought I'd—well, she always worried I'd be renting forever. [excited] But look at me now, right? An actual homeowner! With a porch and everything! [anxious] Oh God, what if something breaks though? Like, I don't even know how to fix a leaky faucet. That's—that's normal, right? Everyone feels this way? 

[very sincerely] I couldn't have done this without you. Seriously. Every time I wanted to give up, you'd send those little encouragement texts. "Keep going, you're closer than you think." [sniffle] Sorry, I'm getting all emotional. It's just... [extremely happy] I have a home. My own home.
587. The verdict came in this morning and, um, we won. Big settlement too—enough that Maria can actually get the surgery she needs, pay her bills, you know, start over. [relieved] God, she cried when I told her. [pause] But then I looked across the courtroom and saw Jake's face and I just—[regretful] I mean, twenty years of friendship, gone. Just like that. We used to have barbecues together, our kids played together, and now he won't even, like, look at me. [bitter] He texted me "congratulations" with a period. A fucking period. That's it. [sigh] And honestly, the thing is—I had to take this case, right? Maria couldn't walk after that accident, she lost her job, her whole life basically fell apart because his company cut corners on safety. [frustrated] What was I supposed to do, tell her sorry, I can't help because the CEO is my buddy? [quietly] But God, it hurts. [pause] I keep thinking about our golf trips, those stupid inside jokes we had. [very sad] I guess I always knew this job would cost me something eventually. [slowly] I just, er, never thought it would be him. [long pause] At least Maria gets justice. That has to be enough. [trailing off] It has to be...
588. [excited] Okay so, um, I just finished running the numbers and—honestly, this is incredible. I mean, both companies were basically circling the drain, right? DataSync was hemorrhaging cash, [slowly] burning through like, what, eight million a quarter? And then MicroVault had the infrastructure but, er, absolutely no product innovation. [pause] The thing is, nobody else saw it because they were looking at them separately.

[warm] But here's where it gets beautiful—I started mapping their assets and, you know, it's literally like two puzzle pieces. DataSync had these brilliant AI algorithms but no server capacity, and MicroVault had, hmm, all these empty data centers just sitting there. [speeding up] So I ran the synergy models and the cost savings alone would be, I don't know, forty million in the first year? 

[relieved] And the board actually listened. Like, they really got it when I showed them how the customer bases didn't even overlap—DataSync in healthcare, MicroVault in finance. [chuckle] It's funny because, well, everyone thought I was crazy at first. "Why merge two failing companies?" they said. [confidently] But that's the thing—they weren't failing at the same things. Together they're, um, actually viable. Hell, they're thriving now. [long pause] Sometimes the best deals are the ones nobody else wants to touch.
589. Everyone thinks being the omega means, you know, being weak or whatever, but honestly that's not— [pause] that's not how it works at all. Like, yesterday when those wolves from the northern territory showed up? [anxious] Everyone was getting all aggressive and I could feel it, um, this tension building up that was about to explode into something really bad. And I just... [slowly] I stepped forward and did that thing I do, where I basically diffuse everything? 

[relieved] The alpha from their pack, he actually listened to me. I mean, nobody expects the omega to be the one negotiating, right? But that's the thing— [confidently] I can read the room better than anyone. I know when someone's about to snap, er, when pride is getting in the way of actual solutions. [warm] It's like I can feel what everyone needs to hear to back down without losing face.

So yeah, we avoided a full-on territorial war because I suggested, well, this compromise about the hunting grounds that literally nobody else thought of. [proud] Sometimes being the one who feels everything most intensely? [short pause] That's actually our pack's secret weapon. Everyone's so focused on, uh, strength and dominance, but empathy? [smiling speaking] That's what really keeps us safe.
590. [confidently] So here I am, right? Corner office, the whole thing. I mean, fifteen years of basically killing myself and I finally—[pause] I'm the one everyone reports to now. Kind of surreal, honestly. 

[bitter] You know what's funny though? I, uh, I tried calling Jake yesterday—my best friend since college—and he just... [trailing off] sent me straight to voicemail. Third time this month. And Sarah? [sad] She literally crossed the street when she saw me coming. Like, actually crossed the street to avoid me.

[regretful] I guess somewhere along the way I became that person, you know? The one who's always "too busy" for drinks, who cancels plans because of some emergency meeting that's not really an emergency. [sigh] And now it's like—here's the thing—I've got all these work friends who laugh at my jokes because they have to, who invite me to lunch because, well, I'm the boss now.

[very melancholic] But nobody calls me at 2 AM anymore when their life's falling apart. Nobody texts me stupid memes. [shaky voice] I mean, I won. Right? This is winning? [pause] Sitting here in my perfect office, eating lunch alone again, scrolling through old group chats where I'm just... [whispering] not invited anymore.
591. [exhausted] They let go of thirty people this morning. Thirty. [pause] And I'm just standing there at my station, you know, thinking I'm probably next when—when the emergency order comes through. [anxious] Five thousand units, custom dies for that medical device company, and um, they need them perfect. [bitter] Perfect. After they just gutted our team. 

[frustrated] But I set up my machine anyway, I mean, what else am I gonna do? [focused] And I'm running these cuts and something just... clicks. [excited] Every single piece, dead-on precision, like, we're talking zero-point-zero-zero-one tolerance, [speeding up] and I'm hitting speeds nobody's hit before on this equipment, and the quality control guy, [animated] he's literally standing there with his jaw open because we're—[laugh] we're actually ahead of schedule! 

[shaky voice] The client calls. Says if we pull this off, it's a two-year contract. [pause] Two years. [very quietly] The same managers who just, basically destroyed half our department, [sarcastic] they're suddenly treating me like I'm the second coming. [sigh] 

[sad] I saved their asses. The company's probably safe now, but... [trailing off] those thirty people are still gone. [long pause] I should feel proud, I guess, but honestly? [very melancholic] I just feel empty.
592. [extremely happy] We did it! Oh my God, um, I just got the final numbers and—[gasp softly] twice what we expected. Actually twice! I mean, [relieved] when Sarah called me with the total, I honestly thought she'd made a mistake. Like, there's no way, right? But then she, uh, she read it again and [cheerful] it's real!

[pause] You know, I keep thinking about that little girl, Emma—the one with the, hmm, the butterfly drawings all over her IV pole? [empathetically] Her mom was crying when I told her about the new equipment we can buy now. Not just the basics we hoped for, but like, [animated] the specialty monitors, the comfort items, basically everything on our wish list!

[sniffle] Sorry, I'm just—God, it's been such a long year of planning this thing. And honestly, [hesitantly] there were moments where I thought, what if nobody shows up? What if we barely cover the catering costs? [laugh] But then tonight happened and, er, everyone was so generous. [warm] That moment during the auction when Mr. Peterson doubled his bid just because—[trailing off] I don't know, it's like the whole room understood what this meant. 

[very sincerely] These kids, they're gonna have everything they need now.
593. [relieved] Oh my God, I can't believe it's actually over. Like, when they read the verdict and said "not guilty," I just—[crying while speaking] I mean, eighteen months that man sat in a cell for something he didn't do. And the whole time I had this information, but I was so scared to come forward because, well, the real guy threatened my family, you know? [pause] But seeing Marcus's mom in that courtroom every single day, just... it broke me. 

[anxious] I kept thinking, what if they don't believe me? What if my testimony isn't enough? Like, I basically held this man's entire life in my hands. [shaky voice] The thing is, when I finally told them about seeing Derek at that gas station instead—not Marcus—and showed them the receipt I'd kept, honestly, everything just clicked into place. 

[warm] Marcus hugged me afterwards. This man who lost, um, everything—his job, his reputation—he actually thanked ME. Can you believe that? [sniffle] I should've spoken up sooner, I really should've, but at least... [trailing off] 

[happy] At least he's going home tonight. That's what matters, right? He's finally going home.
594. Twenty-three years. [very sad] Twenty-three years I've been working on sleds in that shop. And now it's just... [pause] I mean, I keep thinking I'm gonna wake up, you know? [shaky voice] Like this is some kind of nightmare or something.

I drove by this morning and, [gasp loudly] God, it's all gone. The lifts, the diagnostic equipment, um, all those specialty Arctic Cat tools I collected over the years. [bitter] The vintage Ski-Doo I was restoring for the Murphy kid—his dad's old sled from the seventies. [sigh] That thing was basically done, I just had to—it doesn't matter now.

[angry] I'm such an idiot! Everyone kept telling me, "Jerry, get insurance, what if something happens?" And I kept thinking, well, I've been careful this long, right? [frustrated] Nothing's ever happened before, so why would it—God, I can't believe I was that stupid. [cry] Thirty-eight thousand dollars I owed on that new dyno system. Still owe, actually.

[whispering] My grandfather's tools were in there too. [sniffle] The ones he used when he started the shop back in '61. Those weren't just, like—they were basically irreplaceable. [very quietly] Mom's gonna be devastated when I tell her.

[exhausted] I guess I could, er, start over somehow? Maybe? [hesitantly] But honestly, I'm fifty-four years old and I just... [trailing off] I don't know if I have it in me.
595. They just... they called me into the office and said it's over. [very quietly] Budget cuts. Like, after three years of monitoring the coral bleaching patterns, documenting every single change, and we were so close to—I mean, [frustrated] we literally just discovered that temperature fluctuation thing last week! The thing is, um, Dr. Martinez kept saying "unfortunate timing" and I'm sitting there thinking, [bitter] yeah, unfortunate for the reefs that are dying while you shuffle your spreadsheets around. 

[pause] 

God, I don't even—honestly, what am I supposed to do now? [very melancholic] All those dawn dives, the nights analyzing data until my eyes burned, and for what? So they could, you know, reallocate funds to some executive's bonus probably. [angry] It's not just my job—it's the octopus nursery we were establishing, the kelp restoration that was actually working! 

[sigh]

My mom's gonna say I should've gone into tech like my sister. [mumbling] "Marine biology isn't stable, honey." Yeah well, neither is the ocean apparently, and someone needs to—[trailing off] 

[long pause]

I guess I'll, uh... I'll pack up my field notes tomorrow. [crying while speaking] Seven years of research. Just like that.
596. [bitter] They're really closing the whole store. Like, the entire thing, and apparently it's—well, they basically said it was my displays. [short pause] I mean, sure, maybe that window with the mannequins was a little avant-garde, but honestly, how was I supposed to know people would find it "disturbing"? [defensive] Corporate kept saying "be creative, take risks," so I did! And then suddenly it's all, um, "Why did you arrange them like that?" and "What were you thinking?" [shaky voice] I was thinking outside the box, that's what.

[regretful] God, I should've just... I don't know, played it safe? Done the boring seasonal stuff everyone expects? [sniffle] But no, I had to go and—the thing is, I really thought I was doing something special. [sad] Twenty-three years that store was open. Twenty-three years, and then I come along for six months and... [trailing off]

[exhausted] My contract's done Friday. They're not even, like, letting me help with the closing sale or anything. [mumbling] "Best if you don't handle any more displays," they said. [long pause] I keep thinking about all those employees who are losing their jobs because I wanted to be, what, artistic? [very sad] Some visual merchandiser I turned out to be.
597. They offered me the position yesterday. Maintenance supervisor. [pause] And I mean, the timing is just—well, it's actually perfect, right? [bitter] Perfect in the most twisted way possible. I'll be there every day now, just... fixing broken things while Sarah's upstairs [trailing off]

[anxious] The thing is, um, I need the insurance, obviously. And the hours, they're actually flexible enough that I can, you know, pop up to oncology whenever. [very quietly] Room 412. [clearing throat] Anyway, HR was like, really understanding about the whole situation, which I guess makes sense because they already know—I mean, everyone knows at this point.

[frustrated] But here's what nobody tells you: I'm gonna be literally maintaining the building where my wife is—[shaky voice] where she's dying. Like, I'll be checking the HVAC in the room next to hers, or, uh, replacing light bulbs in the hallway where we got the diagnosis. [sigh] 

[warm] Sarah actually laughed when I told her. She said, well, at least now you can fix that squeaky wheelchair in the chemo ward. [crying while speaking] God, she's still trying to make me smile through all of this. [long pause] 

[very slowly] So yeah, I start Monday.
598. Oh my God. Oh my God, they said yes. They actually—[gasp softly] I can't even process this right now. Like, three point five million dollars. [very excited] Three point five MILLION! That's not, um, that's not a typo or anything, right? I mean, I kept expecting them to interrupt me during the pitch and just, you know, tear everything apart but they—they loved it. [laugh] They actually loved the platform architecture, and honestly, when I showed them the user acquisition numbers, I could literally see their eyes light up.

[relieved] God, all those nights practicing in front of the mirror, just... saying the same slides over and over until I was basically dreaming in pitch deck format. And that one part where I always stumbled—the financial projections—[cheerful] I nailed it! Like completely nailed it this time! 

[pause]

Wait, this means—oh shit, this means we can actually hire the dev team. [speeding up] We can get the office space, we can launch the beta properly, we can—[trailing off] I should probably call Mom. She's gonna... [extremely happy] she's gonna completely freak out! 

[whispering] We did it. We actually, really did it. This is happening.
599. [anxious] Okay, so, we've got a serious problem here. I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen years and I've never— [pause] The foundation is compromised. [formal] According to our structural assessment, there are multiple hairline fractures running through the load-bearing sections, and, um, the southeast corner has shifted approximately three inches. [worried] That's not supposed to happen.

[clearing throat] Look, I don't want to alarm anyone, but [very quietly] this is really, really bad. The concrete is basically crumbling in places where— [frustrated] God, how did it even get this bad without anyone noticing? [quickly] We're talking potential catastrophic failure here, like the whole building could—I mean, we need to evacuate. Now.

[shaky voice] I've already called the structural engineers, they're on their way, but honestly? [pause] This building shouldn't have anyone in it. [stern] I'm recommending immediate evacuation of all floors. The cracks, they're, uh, they're growing. [very loudly] We measured them this morning and they've expanded another millimeter just since lunch!

[apologetic] I know this is going to be a huge disruption, but [passionately] people's lives are at stake here! [hesitantly] The repair costs alone are going to be—well, that's not even the main concern right now. [urgent] We need everyone out within the hour, maybe less.
600. [cheerful] So I'm doing my usual route today, right? Just, you know, reading meters like always, and um, I'm behind the Johnsons' house when I hear this— [curious] this little meowing sound. And honestly, I'm thinking maybe it's nothing, but then [concerned] I see this orange tabby just huddled under their deck, and the thing is, it's wearing a collar. [empathetically] Poor thing looked so scared, I mean, really terrified. 

So anyway, I'm like— [hesitantly] should I even touch it? But then, uh, I remembered seeing those posters. [excited] Those kids! Those kids from two streets over! They'd been, like, putting up these handmade signs everywhere about their missing cat, Pumpkin or something. [warm] And I just thought about how devastated they must be, you know?

[determined] So I basically just scooped up the cat—it was actually pretty friendly once I got close—and err, walked straight to their house. [emotional] And when those kids opened the door and saw their cat... [pause] God, they just— [crying while speaking] they started crying and hugging the cat and then, like, they hugged me too? [laugh] Their mom was crying, I was getting all choked up. [relieved] It's just... sometimes this job, it's not just about reading meters, you know? [happy] Sometimes you actually get to, um, make someone's whole day.
Character 1: [soft-spoken] I wasn't supposed to be cleaning this wing tonight but the schedule got, [confused], mixed up and now I've seen what you're doing to yourself.
601. The syringes and vials aren't, [quietly], what you think they are—they're part of something, [exhausted], much more complicated than stealing medication. [pause]
Character 1: Well, um, I've been watching you inject yourself with, [anxious], whatever that blue serum is for three nights now and, er, you always look so, [shaky voice], sick afterwards like you're dying. [sigh]
602. [gently] I am dying, have been for months, but that's, [resigned], not why I'm doing this—these treatments could save dozens of patients if I can just, [determined], prove they're safe by testing them on someone who's already, [trailing off], running out of time anyway.
Character 1: [whispering] Um, I mean, that's, well, insane.
603. [warm] Someone has to be first to try these experimental drugs and I'd rather it be, [bitter], someone who chose this path than a desperate patient who, [very quietly], thinks it's their only hope when we don't even know the side effects. [long pause]
Character 1: [hesitantly] So, um, you're like, using your own body as a, [lost], testing ground for treatments that might not even work while you're, er, already fighting terminal cancer and nobody else knows what you're, [crying while speaking], sacrificing for them?
604. The research team thinks these compounds are, [excited], promising but they need human trials which take years to approve while people are, [frustrated], dying right now in beds just down this hallway waiting for, [melancholic], miracles that might never come.
Character 1: [relieved] You're the nurse who always stays late with the terminal patients, the one who, [empathetically], holds their hands when their families can't bear to visit anymore, who tells them, [passionately], stories about the future treatments that will help people like them. [gasp softly]
605. [monotone] Well, um, those stories aren't just fantasies anymore because I mean, I've been documenting every reaction and, you know, side effect in detailed journals that will help researchers understand these treatments better.
Character 1: [curious] How long have you been doing this to yourself and does anyone, [concerned], a doctor or administrator or even your family know what you're, [upset], putting yourself through every night?
606. Six months of careful doses and meticulous notes while my body, [slowly], deteriorates but the data gets stronger. [cough]
Character 1: [stern] This is heroic and stupid at the same time because you're destroying yourself to maybe, [angry], save strangers who will never know your name or that you, [whispering loudly], suffered alone in this storage room for them.
607. [cheerful] Well, um, the third trial is showing real promise and, er, if my calculations are right, we could have, [animated], a breakthrough that changes how we treat lymphatic cancers, which means, I mean, my death might actually, [proudly], mean something.
Character 1: [apologetic] Look, umm, I'm just a janitor who cleans floors and, well, empties trash but even I know that what you're doing is, like, both the bravest and, [trembling], loneliest thing I've ever witnessed. [sniffle]
608. [formal] The next injection happens in twenty minutes and you can either report me, [pleading], ending this research, or pretend you never saw anything. [deep breath]
Character 1: Well, um, maybe you don't have to, er, do this alone anymore because I could, [shy], sit with you through the reactions and, you know, call for help if something goes wrong. [pause]
609. [grateful] That would mean having a witness to either my, [fearful], greatest failure or most important contribution to medicine. [laugh]
Character 1: Every hero needs someone to remember their story, even if, [very sincerely], that someone is just a night janitor who stumbled into the wrong room at the, [hoarse], right time. [gasp]
610. Then stay and watch me save the world one, [peaceful], injection at a time while my body becomes the bridge between, [accepting], suffering and hope for patients I'll never, [very slowly], meet but desperately want to help.
Character 1: [warm] I've been waiting here in this, [relieved], room for someone like you to finally come investigate what, [whispering], really happened to all of us who died here.
611. [shocked] I can, um, actually see you standing there which, well, [shaky voice], shouldn't be possible but you know, [confused], here we are having this conversation about the complaints I've been investigating.
Character 1: [gently] The other residents who passed before me, [bitter], they're still here too, waiting for someone to understand that the neglect wasn't just, [empathetically], administrative oversight.
612. The files I've been, um, reviewing show patterns of medication errors and, [hesitantly], staffing shortages but, well, [anxious], nothing that explains why you're appearing to me now. [pause]
Character 1: [calmly] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, we can only manifest to people who, [sincerely], genuinely care about finding the truth, you know? [sigh]
613. [determined] Every complaint letter mentioned the same nurse on duty during the, [quietly], unexpected deaths, but the administration kept, [frustrated], dismissing concerns as coincidence rather than investigating properly.
Character 1: Um, she would come into our rooms at night, I mean, [crying while speaking], pretending to check vitals while actually, well, [very quietly], administering something that wasn't prescribed. [long pause]
614. [whispering loudly] This is evidence.
Character 1: [sad] The living can't testify about what we experienced but, [passionately], you can document the patterns in ways that force them to, [slowly], acknowledge what they've been deliberately ignoring for years.
615. I've been, er, investigating complaints for fifteen years but, um, [trembling], this is the first time the victims themselves have, well, [very melancholic], directly shown me what I needed to see.
Character 1: My daughter filed three complaints before I died, [angry], begging someone to listen, but the responses were always form letters saying, [monotone], everything met regulatory standards. [gasp]
616. [apologetic] The system failed you and everyone else who died here unnecessarily.
Character 1: [resigned] Well, I mean, we don't need apologies anymore, um, we just need, [hopeful], someone to prevent it from happening to others, you know? [laugh]
617. [confidently] I have enough now to bypass the local administration and take this directly to, [stern], federal investigators who can't be, [loudly], intimidated or bought off by the facility's owners.
Character 1: Um, before you go, I mean, there's something else—well, [exhausted], the maintenance closet in wing C has, [trailing off], hidden records they thought were destroyed...
618. [curious] So, um, you're telling me that, well, [excited], they kept evidence of their own crimes because, I mean, [whispering], they never expected anyone would look there? [cough]
Character 1: We've been, um, protecting those documents somehow, you know, [cheerful], keeping them from deteriorating while we waited for someone like you to, well, [playful], finally arrive and make things right.
619. [grateful] Your persistence even after death is going to, [emotionally], save lives and bring justice to families who've been, [very sincerely], grieving without answers for far too long. [deep sigh]
Character 1: [peacefully] Once you expose the truth, [softly], we can finally rest.
620. I promise you that by next week, [firmly], every relevant authority will have copies of this evidence and, [passionately], the investigation will be too public for anyone to, [determinedly], cover up or dismiss. [short pause]
