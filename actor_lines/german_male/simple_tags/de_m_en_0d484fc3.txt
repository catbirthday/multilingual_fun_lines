Scenario: A timid night janitor at a hospital discovers a terminally ill nurse who has been secretly administering experimental treatments to herself to test their safety before recommending them to patients.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [soft-spoken] I wasn't supposed to be cleaning this wing tonight but the schedule got, [confused], mixed up and now I've seen what you're doing to yourself.

Character 2 [en]: The syringes and vials aren't, [quietly], what you think they are—they're part of something, [exhausted], much more complicated than stealing medication. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, I've been watching you inject yourself with, [anxious], whatever that blue serum is for three nights now and, er, you always look so, [shaky voice], sick afterwards like you're dying. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I am dying, have been for months, but that's, [resigned], not why I'm doing this—these treatments could save dozens of patients if I can just, [determined], prove they're safe by testing them on someone who's already, [trailing off], running out of time anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Um, I mean, that's, well, insane.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] Someone has to be first to try these experimental drugs and I'd rather it be, [bitter], someone who chose this path than a desperate patient who, [very quietly], thinks it's their only hope when we don't even know the side effects. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So, um, you're like, using your own body as a, [lost], testing ground for treatments that might not even work while you're, er, already fighting terminal cancer and nobody else knows what you're, [crying while speaking], sacrificing for them?

Character 2 [en]: The research team thinks these compounds are, [excited], promising but they need human trials which take years to approve while people are, [frustrated], dying right now in beds just down this hallway waiting for, [melancholic], miracles that might never come.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You're the nurse who always stays late with the terminal patients, the one who, [empathetically], holds their hands when their families can't bear to visit anymore, who tells them, [passionately], stories about the future treatments that will help people like them. [gasp softly]

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] Well, um, those stories aren't just fantasies anymore because I mean, I've been documenting every reaction and, you know, side effect in detailed journals that will help researchers understand these treatments better.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] How long have you been doing this to yourself and does anyone, [concerned], a doctor or administrator or even your family know what you're, [upset], putting yourself through every night?

Character 2 [en]: Six months of careful doses and meticulous notes while my body, [slowly], deteriorates but the data gets stronger. [cough]

Character 1 [en]: [stern] This is heroic and stupid at the same time because you're destroying yourself to maybe, [angry], save strangers who will never know your name or that you, [whispering loudly], suffered alone in this storage room for them.

Character 2 [en]: [cheerful] Well, um, the third trial is showing real promise and, er, if my calculations are right, we could have, [animated], a breakthrough that changes how we treat lymphatic cancers, which means, I mean, my death might actually, [proudly], mean something.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Look, umm, I'm just a janitor who cleans floors and, well, empties trash but even I know that what you're doing is, like, both the bravest and, [trembling], loneliest thing I've ever witnessed. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: [formal] The next injection happens in twenty minutes and you can either report me, [pleading], ending this research, or pretend you never saw anything. [deep breath]

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, maybe you don't have to, er, do this alone anymore because I could, [shy], sit with you through the reactions and, you know, call for help if something goes wrong. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] That would mean having a witness to either my, [fearful], greatest failure or most important contribution to medicine. [laugh]

Character 1 [en]: Every hero needs someone to remember their story, even if, [very sincerely], that someone is just a night janitor who stumbled into the wrong room at the, [hoarse], right time. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: Then stay and watch me save the world one, [peaceful], injection at a time while my body becomes the bridge between, [accepting], suffering and hope for patients I'll never, [very slowly], meet but desperately want to help.
