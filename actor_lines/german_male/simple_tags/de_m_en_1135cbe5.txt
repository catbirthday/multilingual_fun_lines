=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [warm] I've been waiting here in this, [relieved], room for someone like you to finally come investigate what, [whispering], really happened to all of us who died here.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] I can, um, actually see you standing there which, well, [shaky voice], shouldn't be possible but you know, [confused], here we are having this conversation about the complaints I've been investigating.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] The other residents who passed before me, [bitter], they're still here too, waiting for someone to understand that the neglect wasn't just, [empathetically], administrative oversight.

Character 2 [en]: The files I've been, um, reviewing show patterns of medication errors and, [hesitantly], staffing shortages but, well, [anxious], nothing that explains why you're appearing to me now. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [calmly] Well, um, the thing is, I mean, we can only manifest to people who, [sincerely], genuinely care about finding the truth, you know? [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Every complaint letter mentioned the same nurse on duty during the, [quietly], unexpected deaths, but the administration kept, [frustrated], dismissing concerns as coincidence rather than investigating properly.

Character 1 [en]: Um, she would come into our rooms at night, I mean, [crying while speaking], pretending to check vitals while actually, well, [very quietly], administering something that wasn't prescribed. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [whispering loudly] This is evidence.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] The living can't testify about what we experienced but, [passionately], you can document the patterns in ways that force them to, [slowly], acknowledge what they've been deliberately ignoring for years.

Character 2 [en]: I've been, er, investigating complaints for fifteen years but, um, [trembling], this is the first time the victims themselves have, well, [very melancholic], directly shown me what I needed to see.

Character 1 [en]: My daughter filed three complaints before I died, [angry], begging someone to listen, but the responses were always form letters saying, [monotone], everything met regulatory standards. [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] The system failed you and everyone else who died here unnecessarily.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Well, I mean, we don't need apologies anymore, um, we just need, [hopeful], someone to prevent it from happening to others, you know? [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] I have enough now to bypass the local administration and take this directly to, [stern], federal investigators who can't be, [loudly], intimidated or bought off by the facility's owners.

Character 1 [en]: Um, before you go, I mean, there's something else—well, [exhausted], the maintenance closet in wing C has, [trailing off], hidden records they thought were destroyed...

Character 2 [en]: [curious] So, um, you're telling me that, well, [excited], they kept evidence of their own crimes because, I mean, [whispering], they never expected anyone would look there? [cough]

Character 1 [en]: We've been, um, protecting those documents somehow, you know, [cheerful], keeping them from deteriorating while we waited for someone like you to, well, [playful], finally arrive and make things right.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] Your persistence even after death is going to, [emotionally], save lives and bring justice to families who've been, [very sincerely], grieving without answers for far too long. [deep sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [peacefully] Once you expose the truth, [softly], we can finally rest.

Character 2 [en]: I promise you that by next week, [firmly], every relevant authority will have copies of this evidence and, [passionately], the investigation will be too public for anyone to, [determinedly], cover up or dismiss. [short pause]
