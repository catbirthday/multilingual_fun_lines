=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] The flood assessment report you're preparing could, [frustrated], shut down our entire facility where three hundred families, [shaky voice], depend on those jobs for survival. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Um, I know.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Your voice sounds so familiar but I can't, [slowly], place where I've heard it before.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, um, the climate models show, [bitter], catastrophic flooding within eighteen months, and I mean, [trembling], we can't ignore that data anymore.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, Sarah? [gasp]

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Um, I didn't know you, like, worked here when they assigned me this, [empathetically], evaluation, and now I'm supposed to be, [professional], objective about destroying your livelihood, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, fifteen years since you left and now you're here to, [angry], take away everything I've built to support my kids.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] The waters are rising faster than anyone, [very quietly], predicted when we were kids playing by that creek. [sigh]

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Mom's dying.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] I mean, um, I heard through cousins but didn't know if, [sad], you'd want me there after everything that, [whispering], happened between us.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] Well, um, she asks about you every day even though, [bored], I tell her the same lie about you being too busy.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] My job is protecting people from climate disasters but I couldn't, [passionately], protect our family from falling apart.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] You chose your career over us when Dad's factory closed, [relieved], running off to study environmental science instead of helping. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Someone had to understand why these disasters keep, [quickly], happening to working families like ours.

Character 1 [en]: [mocking] And now you're the expert who gets to, [coldly], decide which families lose everything next. [groan]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] Well, um, there might be a way to, [carefully], relocate the facility to higher ground if, er, [hopefully], we work together on the proposal, you know? [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: The company won't pay for relocation unless someone with, [hesitantly], your credentials makes it about saving lives not, [pleading], just saving jobs.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Um, I mean, I've already started drafting emergency funding applications that could, [excited], cover seventy percent of moving costs.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You started this before knowing I worked here which means, um, [curious], you actually care about these people not just, well, [soft-spoken], the data. [sniffle]

Character 2 [en]: Every flood zone I assess has families like ours who, [melancholic], never saw it coming until the water was already, [chuckle], at their door and by then, [whispering loudly], it's too late.
