Scenario: An overnight success returns to their old art school to give a speech and encounters their former roommate who's still struggling as a concept artist in their shared former studio space.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [excited] God, I can't believe you're still here working in the same studio we used to, [nostalgic], share back when we were both broke art students.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Well, um, not everyone gets to, [frustrated], become an overnight sensation with their first, [jealous], gallery show, you know, some of us are still grinding it out here.

Character 1 [en]: The overnight thing is such a myth though, I spent, [anxious], three years eating ramen and selling paintings at farmers markets before, [defensive], anything clicked, and even then it was just, [quickly], pure luck that collector saw my work.

Character 2 [en]: [coldly] Right, well, luck or not, um, you're giving keynotes now while I'm still, [sad], doing concept art for mobile games that never ship, so...

Character 1 [en]: That's not fair and you know it, you were always, [empathetically], the talented one, remember how Professor Chen said your fantasy worlds were, [passionately], unlike anything she'd seen, that your imagination was, [sincerely], extraordinary and rare. [sigh]

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] Imagination doesn't pay rent though, does it, and watching you on magazine covers while I'm, [melancholic], still here in this cramped space we used to dream in together, [voice breaking], it's just hard to not feel like I'm, [trailing off], disappearing somehow...

Character 1 [en]: [gently] You're not disappearing, Sarah, your work still takes my, [warm], breath away every time I see it online, and honestly the success feels, [hesitantly], hollow sometimes because I know deep down your art has more, [very quietly], soul than mine ever will. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] You don't have to say that just to, um, make me feel better, I mean, [shaky voice], we both know the market decided who matters and, uh, who doesn't. [sniffle]

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Listen, um, I didn't just come here for the speech, I actually, [nervously], wanted to ask if you'd consider, well, being the lead concept artist for my new project.

Character 2 [en]: [shocked] Wait, what, I mean, are you serious right now because, um, this feels like, [confused], charity and I don't need your, [proudly], pity job offer just because we used to be friends, you know, I still have my dignity here.

Character 1 [en]: [earnestly] This isn't charity, Sarah, I've been following your work for years and the ethereal, [animated], quality of your environments is exactly what this project needs, plus the budget is substantial and you'd have, [confidently], complete creative freedom to build the visual world from scratch.

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, I've been rejected so many, [defeated], times that I don't even know if I can, [trembling], trust good news anymore, like what if I'm not, [very softly], good enough for your fancy new world?

Character 1 [en]: [tenderly] You were good enough when we were nineteen and eating cereal for dinner, you were good enough when you stayed up, [emotionally], three nights straight perfecting that dragon series, and you're good enough now even if the world hasn't, [firmly], noticed yet. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] God, I hate this.

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Hey, remember when, um, we used to say we'd change the art world together, well, [hopeful], maybe we still can, just differently than we imagined.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerably] You really think my weird fantasy stuff could, um, work for whatever you're planning because, I mean, [cautiously], I haven't changed my style despite everyone telling me to be more, [bitterly], commercial, and honestly I don't think I can change it now even if I wanted to.

Character 1 [en]: [enthusiastically] That's exactly why I need you, um, because you never sold out, you never, [admiringly], compromised your vision, and that integrity shows in every piece you create. [laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] Integrity doesn't feel like much when you're thirty and your parents still ask when you're getting, um, a real job, but hearing you say that, [gratefully], seeing you actually value what I refused to give up, well, [choking up], maybe I haven't been completely foolish all these years. [cry]

Character 1 [en]: You were never foolish, just, [lovingly], stubborn in the best possible way, the way real artists have to be. [smile]

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Okay, yes, I'll do it, but only if, um, you promise this is because you actually want my work, not because, well, [hopefully], you feel sorry for the girl who got left behind, because I need this to be, [desperately], real, you know?
