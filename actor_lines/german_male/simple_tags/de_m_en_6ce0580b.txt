Scenario: A cloud engineer discovers their estranged father's estate planner is their former college roommate who knows about the family's bitter past, meeting to discuss digital assets after the father's sudden death.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Marcus, I didn't expect it to be you handling this—when the firm said they were sending someone, I just assumed it would be a stranger, not someone who knows exactly why I hadn't spoken to him in fifteen years.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] I tried to have someone else take the case when I saw the name, but we're the only firm in town that handles digital asset succession, and your father specifically requested us. [clearing throat] I understand if you want to work with someone else.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] He would pick the one firm where you work, wouldn't he? [exhales] Even dead, he's still finding ways to make things complicated, forcing me to sit here and discuss his precious crypto wallets and cloud storage accounts.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] The digital assets are actually substantial—we're talking about several million in various cryptocurrencies, NFT collections, and proprietary software licenses stored across multiple platforms. [pause] He was very specific about the security protocols.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Of course he was meticulous about protecting his digital fortune while being completely absent from protecting his actual family. [quietly] You remember what he was like, Marcus—you were there for some of it.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] I remember the night you showed up at our dorm room with that bruise on your jaw, yeah. [very sincerely] But legally, I need to execute his wishes as written, regardless of our history or what I personally think about him.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] The irony is that I'm probably the only one in the family who actually understands the technical complexity of what he built—all those distributed systems, the multi-signature wallets, the encrypted backups across different cloud providers.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] That's why he specified you as the primary beneficiary for the digital holdings. [sighs] He wrote in the codicil that you were the only one who'd appreciate what he'd created, even if you'd never appreciate him.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] Don't quote his words to me like they mean something profound when we both know he only cared about his legacy being preserved, not about making amends or acknowledging what he did.

Character 2 [en]: The authentication keys are split across seven different cold storage devices, and the recovery phrases are distributed using Shamir's Secret Sharing—you'll need at least four of the six trustees to reconstruct them. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Typical paranoid bastard.

Character 2 [en]: [carefully] There's something else—he left a series of encrypted messages on the blockchain, timestamped over the last five years, all addressed to you. [very quietly] I haven't decrypted them, but the keys are part of the estate.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Messages he could have sent while he was alive instead of hiding them in smart contracts like some coward who couldn't pick up a phone or write an actual letter. [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [deferential] You don't have to read them, obviously—you could just take the assets and leave the messages encrypted forever if that's what you want to do with them.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] The thing is, I know exactly how his mind worked with systems like this—he would have built in a dead man's switch, something that triggers if the messages aren't accessed within a certain timeframe. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [surprised] You're right—there's a smart contract that will donate everything to charity if the primary beneficiary doesn't claim the assets within ninety days. [quietly] He really did know you'd understand his logic patterns. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: Even in death, he's still trying to control me, force my hand, make me engage with him on his terms using the technology we both speak. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Look, we can do this at whatever pace you need—I'll handle all the technical execution, you just tell me what you want to access and when you're ready to deal with it.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Fine, let's start with the wallet addresses and work our way through the authentication process, but I'm not touching those messages yet—I need time to decide if I even want to know what he had to say.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] That's completely fair, and for what it's worth, I'm sorry you have to go through this. [gently] I know it doesn't change anything, but he did seem different in those last few years, more aware of what he'd lost. [trailing off]
