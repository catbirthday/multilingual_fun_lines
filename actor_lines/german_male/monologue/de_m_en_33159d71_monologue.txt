Speaker [en]: [confidently] So here I am, right? Corner office, the whole thing. I mean, fifteen years of basically killing myself and I finally—[pause] I'm the one everyone reports to now. Kind of surreal, honestly. 

[bitter] You know what's funny though? I, uh, I tried calling Jake yesterday—my best friend since college—and he just... [trailing off] sent me straight to voicemail. Third time this month. And Sarah? [sad] She literally crossed the street when she saw me coming. Like, actually crossed the street to avoid me.

[regretful] I guess somewhere along the way I became that person, you know? The one who's always "too busy" for drinks, who cancels plans because of some emergency meeting that's not really an emergency. [sigh] And now it's like—here's the thing—I've got all these work friends who laugh at my jokes because they have to, who invite me to lunch because, well, I'm the boss now.

[very melancholic] But nobody calls me at 2 AM anymore when their life's falling apart. Nobody texts me stupid memes. [shaky voice] I mean, I won. Right? This is winning? [pause] Sitting here in my perfect office, eating lunch alone again, scrolling through old group chats where I'm just... [whispering] not invited anymore.
