Speaker [en]: [anxious] Okay, so, we've got a serious problem here. I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen years and I've never— [pause] The foundation is compromised. [formal] According to our structural assessment, there are multiple hairline fractures running through the load-bearing sections, and, um, the southeast corner has shifted approximately three inches. [worried] That's not supposed to happen.

[clearing throat] Look, I don't want to alarm anyone, but [very quietly] this is really, really bad. The concrete is basically crumbling in places where— [frustrated] God, how did it even get this bad without anyone noticing? [quickly] We're talking potential catastrophic failure here, like the whole building could—I mean, we need to evacuate. Now.

[shaky voice] I've already called the structural engineers, they're on their way, but honestly? [pause] This building shouldn't have anyone in it. [stern] I'm recommending immediate evacuation of all floors. The cracks, they're, uh, they're growing. [very loudly] We measured them this morning and they've expanded another millimeter just since lunch!

[apologetic] I know this is going to be a huge disruption, but [passionately] people's lives are at stake here! [hesitantly] The repair costs alone are going to be—well, that's not even the main concern right now. [urgent] We need everyone out within the hour, maybe less.
