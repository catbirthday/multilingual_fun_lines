Speaker [en]: Everyone thinks being the omega means, you know, being weak or whatever, but honestly that's not— [pause] that's not how it works at all. Like, yesterday when those wolves from the northern territory showed up? [anxious] Everyone was getting all aggressive and I could feel it, um, this tension building up that was about to explode into something really bad. And I just... [slowly] I stepped forward and did that thing I do, where I basically diffuse everything? 

[relieved] The alpha from their pack, he actually listened to me. I mean, nobody expects the omega to be the one negotiating, right? But that's the thing— [confidently] I can read the room better than anyone. I know when someone's about to snap, er, when pride is getting in the way of actual solutions. [warm] It's like I can feel what everyone needs to hear to back down without losing face.

So yeah, we avoided a full-on territorial war because I suggested, well, this compromise about the hunting grounds that literally nobody else thought of. [proud] Sometimes being the one who feels everything most intensely? [short pause] That's actually our pack's secret weapon. Everyone's so focused on, uh, strength and dominance, but empathy? [smiling speaking] That's what really keeps us safe.
