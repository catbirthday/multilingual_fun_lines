Speaker [en]: [cheerful] So I'm doing my usual route today, right? Just, you know, reading meters like always, and um, I'm behind the Johnsons' house when I hear this— [curious] this little meowing sound. And honestly, I'm thinking maybe it's nothing, but then [concerned] I see this orange tabby just huddled under their deck, and the thing is, it's wearing a collar. [empathetically] Poor thing looked so scared, I mean, really terrified. 

So anyway, I'm like— [hesitantly] should I even touch it? But then, uh, I remembered seeing those posters. [excited] Those kids! Those kids from two streets over! They'd been, like, putting up these handmade signs everywhere about their missing cat, Pumpkin or something. [warm] And I just thought about how devastated they must be, you know?

[determined] So I basically just scooped up the cat—it was actually pretty friendly once I got close—and err, walked straight to their house. [emotional] And when those kids opened the door and saw their cat... [pause] God, they just— [crying while speaking] they started crying and hugging the cat and then, like, they hugged me too? [laugh] Their mom was crying, I was getting all choked up. [relieved] It's just... sometimes this job, it's not just about reading meters, you know? [happy] Sometimes you actually get to, um, make someone's whole day.
