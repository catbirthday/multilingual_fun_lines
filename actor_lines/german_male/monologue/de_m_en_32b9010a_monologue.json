[slowly] I stepped forward and did that thing I do, where I basically diffuse everything? \n\n[relieved] The alpha from their pack, he actually listened to me. I mean, nobody expects the omega to be the one negotiating, right? But that's the thing— [confidently] I can read the room better than anyone. I know when someone's about to snap, er, when pride is getting in the way of actual solutions. [warm] It's like I can feel what everyone needs to hear to back down without losing face.\n\nSo yeah, we avoided a full-on territorial war because I suggested, well, this compromise about the hunting grounds that literally nobody else thought of. [proud] Sometimes being the one who feels everything most intensely? [short pause] That's actually our pack's secret weapon. Everyone's so focused on, uh, strength and dominance, but empathy? [smiling speaking] That's what really keeps us safe."
