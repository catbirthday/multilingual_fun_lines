Well, honestly, I was a bit skeptical at first because, like, they had all these wild ideas and I'm thinking—[hesitantly] okay, sure, whatever, let's just see what happens, right? \n\nBut then, err, Monday morning comes and they've completely transformed the window. I mean, [gasp loudly] there were actual people stopping on the sidewalk! Like, not just glancing—actually stopping, taking photos, calling their friends over. [laugh] The thing is, uh, I've never seen anything like it in the fifteen years I've owned this place.\n\n[speeding up] And the sales numbers, oh my God, the sales numbers! We're talking triple—TRIPLE—what we normally do. Actually, no wait, [pause] let me check again because I keep thinking I'm reading it wrong. [whispering] Yeah, it's really triple. \n\n[warm] You know what though? I should have trusted them from the start. They kept saying, \"Just wait, you'll see,\" and I was all—[mocking] yeah yeah, sure, we'll see. But honestly, they were so right. I'm just—[sigh] I don't know, I'm kind of emotional about it? Because this could really change everything for us. [cheerful] I already texted them a huge thank you, but tomorrow, they're getting the biggest bonus I can manage!"
