Speaker [en]: [relieved] Oh my God, I can't believe it's actually over. Like, when they read the verdict and said "not guilty," I just—[crying while speaking] I mean, eighteen months that man sat in a cell for something he didn't do. And the whole time I had this information, but I was so scared to come forward because, well, the real guy threatened my family, you know? [pause] But seeing Marcus's mom in that courtroom every single day, just... it broke me. 

[anxious] I kept thinking, what if they don't believe me? What if my testimony isn't enough? Like, I basically held this man's entire life in my hands. [shaky voice] The thing is, when I finally told them about seeing Derek at that gas station instead—not Marcus—and showed them the receipt I'd kept, honestly, everything just clicked into place. 

[warm] Marcus hugged me afterwards. This man who lost, um, everything—his job, his reputation—he actually thanked ME. Can you believe that? [sniffle] I should've spoken up sooner, I really should've, but at least... [trailing off] 

[happy] At least he's going home tonight. That's what matters, right? He's finally going home.
