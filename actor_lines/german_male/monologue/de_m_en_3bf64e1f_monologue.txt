Speaker [en]: Oh my God. Oh my God, they said yes. They actually—[gasp softly] I can't even process this right now. Like, three point five million dollars. [very excited] Three point five MILLION! That's not, um, that's not a typo or anything, right? I mean, I kept expecting them to interrupt me during the pitch and just, you know, tear everything apart but they—they loved it. [laugh] They actually loved the platform architecture, and honestly, when I showed them the user acquisition numbers, I could literally see their eyes light up.

[relieved] God, all those nights practicing in front of the mirror, just... saying the same slides over and over until I was basically dreaming in pitch deck format. And that one part where I always stumbled—the financial projections—[cheerful] I nailed it! Like completely nailed it this time! 

[pause]

Wait, this means—oh shit, this means we can actually hire the dev team. [speeding up] We can get the office space, we can launch the beta properly, we can—[trailing off] I should probably call Mom. She's gonna... [extremely happy] she's gonna completely freak out! 

[whispering] We did it. We actually, really did it. This is happening.
