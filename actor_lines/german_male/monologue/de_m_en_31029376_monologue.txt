Speaker [en]: [extremely happy] I just signed the papers! Two years—two whole years of, like, eating ramen and skipping vacations, and it's actually happening. [shaky voice] My hands were literally shaking when I picked up the pen. You probably thought I was being dramatic, but um, this is everything I've been working toward. Remember when you first sat me down and showed me that spreadsheet? [laugh] I thought you were insane. "Save thirty percent of your income," you said, and I was like—there's no way. But you broke it down, week by week, and somehow... [warm] somehow you made it feel possible. 

[pause] I keep thinking about calling my mom. She never thought I'd—well, she always worried I'd be renting forever. [excited] But look at me now, right? An actual homeowner! With a porch and everything! [anxious] Oh God, what if something breaks though? Like, I don't even know how to fix a leaky faucet. That's—that's normal, right? Everyone feels this way? 

[very sincerely] I couldn't have done this without you. Seriously. Every time I wanted to give up, you'd send those little encouragement texts. "Keep going, you're closer than you think." [sniffle] Sorry, I'm getting all emotional. It's just... [extremely happy] I have a home. My own home.
