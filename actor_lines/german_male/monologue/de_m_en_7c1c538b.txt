Subject: Your shy packer colleague finally speaking up in meetings after months of your encouragement

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [very excited] Oh my God, did you see that? [pause] Marcus just—he actually spoke up in the meeting! [delighted] I mean, after all these months of me basically nudging him under the table and mouthing "say something," he finally did it. [laugh] And not just like a quiet little comment either. [proudly] He actually disagreed with Brad about the workflow changes! [short pause] I was sitting there thinking, okay, this is it, he's gonna back down when Brad pushed back, but no—Marcus held his ground. [warm] He explained his whole idea about reorganizing the packing stations, and honestly? It was brilliant. [empathetically] I could see his hands shaking a little bit, but his voice was steady. [pause] You know what really got me though? [very sincerely] When he said "I've been thinking about this for months," I just—I almost teared up right there. [laugh softly] All those lunch breaks where I kept telling him his ideas mattered, that people would listen if he just... tried. [happy] And today he finally believed it. [sigh] God, I'm like a proud parent or something. [cheerful] But seriously, did you see Brad's face? [animated] He was actually impressed!
