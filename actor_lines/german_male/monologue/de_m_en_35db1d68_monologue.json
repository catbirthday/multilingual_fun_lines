But then she, uh, she read it again and [cheerful] it's real!\n\n[pause] You know, I keep thinking about that little girl, Emma—the one with the, hmm, the butterfly drawings all over her IV pole? [empathetically] Her mom was crying when I told her about the new equipment we can buy now. Not just the basics we hoped for, but like, [animated] the specialty monitors, the comfort items, basically everything on our wish list!\n\n[sniffle] Sorry, I'm just—God, it's been such a long year of planning this thing. And honestly, [hesitantly] there were moments where I thought, what if nobody shows up? What if we barely cover the catering costs? [laugh] But then tonight happened and, er, everyone was so generous. [warm] That moment during the auction when Mr. Peterson doubled his bid just because—[trailing off] I don't know, it's like the whole room understood what this meant. \n\n[very sincerely] These kids, they're gonna have everything they need now."
