Character 1 [en]: So, um, did you hear about the, you know, massive pivot announcement from, er, the product team?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, they're completely abandoning the B2B model [very sincerely] and going direct-to-consumer like Slack did back in 2013. It's a huge shift from enterprise sales to self-service signups, which could either be brilliant or catastrophic.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, I thought, hmm, we were following the, basically, Salesforce playbook with enterprise contracts?

Character 2 [en]: That was the original plan, but apparently leadership got spooked by our burn rate and customer acquisition costs. They're looking at how Twitter pivoted from podcasting platform Odeo to microblogging and thinking we need that kind of dramatic shift.

Character 1 [en]: But we just hired twenty enterprise sales reps last month!

Character 2 [en]: I know, and [very meekly] that's the part that really bothers me about this whole thing. Those people relocated their families, and now they're being told their entire role might not exist in six months.

Character 1 [en]: Actually, [deep pitch] the way I see it, you know, this is just like when, uhh, Netflix pivoted from DVD rentals.

Character 2 [en]: Netflix's pivot from DVDs to streaming was gradual and strategic over several years though. What we're doing feels more like Instagram's overnight pivot from Burbn, just ripping the band-aid off completely.

Character 1 [en]: Speaking of Instagram, didn't Kevin Systrom say something about pivots being necessary?

Character 2 [en]: He did say that recognizing when to pivot is crucial for startup survival. But he also had a clear vision - Burbn was too complicated, so they simplified to just photo-sharing, which became a billion-dollar idea.

Character 1 [en]: Oh god, [gasp] I mean, what if we, er, end up like, honestly, Groupon after their pivot attempts?

Character 2 [en]: Groupon's [laugh hard] multiple failed pivots are, well, definitely a cautionary tale! They went from, you know, collective action platform to daily deals to, uhh, whatever they're trying to be now - a marketplace, delivery service, basically everything at once.

Character 1 [en]: So, uh, do you think management is, like, actually studying these pivot case studies or just, I guess, winging it?

Character 2 [en]: Based on yesterday's all-hands, the thing is, they seem to be, hmm, cherry-picking success stories without, really, considering why PayPal's pivot from Palm Pilot payments worked while, err, Friendster's pivot attempts failed miserably.

Character 1 [en]: Right so, what about the, um, technical debt we've accumulated? I mean, our entire architecture is, basically, built for enterprise.

Character 2 [en]: That's exactly the problem - our infrastructure is, actually, optimized for long sales cycles and, you know, high-touch onboarding. Pivoting to self-service means, well, rebuilding everything from scratch, honestly, just like when Flickr pivoted from that game, umm, Game Neverending.

Character 1 [en]: Okay so, are we looking at, er, layoffs then? The thing is, I just, like, signed a new lease.

Character 2 [en]: From what I'm [whispering loudly] hearing through the grapevine, they're trying to avoid layoffs by retraining people. But realistically, converting enterprise sales folks to growth hackers isn't exactly a smooth transition.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I suppose we could, uhh, always end up like Slack - they pivoted from, basically, a game company to, you know, the biggest workplace communication platform.

Character 2 [en]: True! Stewart Butterfield did pull off that pivot twice - first with Flickr, then with Slack from Tiny Speck. Maybe there's hope for us yet, though I'd feel better if our leadership had his track record.
