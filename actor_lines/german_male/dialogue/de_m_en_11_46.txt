Character 1 [en]: Have you seen the Q3 numbers [anxious] for SMB acquisition costs? They're getting brutal.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, CAC to LTV ratios are completely underwater for most verticals. We're seeing $1,800 average acquisition costs for accounts that barely clear $500 monthly recurring revenue - it's unsustainable without significant federal intervention.

Character 1 [en]: What kind of intervention are you thinking?

Character 2 [en]: Senator Mitchell's office is drafting legislation for R&D tax credits specifically targeting sales automation tools. If we can reduce SDR headcount requirements by 40% through AI qualification, the unit economics start working again.

Character 1 [en]: But, um, wouldn't that just, like, accelerate the race to the bottom on, you know, pricing?

Character 2 [en]: Not necessarily - I mean, the real issue is that, er, SMBs have fragmented buying committees now, so your sales cycle, basically, stretches from 21 to 47 days on average.

Character 1 [en]: Well, our close rates are, hmm, tanking too - down to, actually, 12% from initial demo, you know?

Character 2 [en]: The committee is actually [whispering] considering mandatory procurement transparency rules that would require businesses to disclose vendor evaluation timelines, which could compress decision cycles by forcing accountability.

Character 1 [en]: That seems pretty aggressive regulatory-wise.

Character 2 [en]: Sure, but, honestly, we're modeling this after GDPR's impact - initially disruptive but, uhh, ultimately it created standardization that, well, reduced compliance costs by 30% industry-wide after eighteen months.

Character 1 [en]: GDPR was a [bitter] nightmare for our European expansion though. Killed our margins completely.

Character 2 [en]: Right, I know the implementation was [apologetic] rough, and we should've provided better transition support. This time we're proposing a two-year phase-in with exemptions for companies under $10 million ARR.

Character 1 [en]: What about channel partnerships? They're eating 20% off the top.

Character 2 [en]: So, channel margins are, actually, another focus area - we're looking at, hmm, capping referral fees at 15% for government contracts, which would, basically, set a market precedent.

Character 1 [en]: Err, wouldn't VARs just, like, revolt? They're already, um, struggling with compressed margins.

Character 2 [en]: Well, the thing is, VARs would get, you know, preferential treatment in federal procurement scoring, which is worth, uhh, billions annually, so it's actually a net positive for established players.

Character 1 [en]: I guess that makes, er, sense if you're thinking about, sort of, the total addressable market expanding, right so?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly - it's just that, like, if we can reduce friction in the, hmm, middle market, total SMB software spend could increase by, honestly, $47 billion according to our CBO projections.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, that's, um, actually [extremely happy] incredible! We could, basically, triple our TAM!

Character 2 [en]: Precisely. The legislative package hits the floor next month, and we've already got backing from both the Software Alliance and National Small Business Association, which never happens.
