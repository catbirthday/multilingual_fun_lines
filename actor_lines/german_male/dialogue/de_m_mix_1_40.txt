=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: Hey, hast du dir endlich diesen neuen Sandman Band geholt, von dem du erzählt hast?

Character 2 [mix]: Noch nicht! Ich bin total versunken in dieser Serie namens Saga. Hast du sie gelesen? It's this wild space opera with bounty hunters and star-crossed lovers from warring species.

Character 1 [mix]: Oh ja, Saga ist unglaublich! Ich liebe Lying Cat.

Character 2 [mix]: Genau! Jedes Mal wenn diese blaue Katze "LYING" sagt, muss ich lachen. Brian K. Vaughan schreibt so natürliche und witzige Dialoge, but then he'll hit you with these devastating emotional moments out of nowhere.

Character 1 [mix]: Diese Ausgabe mit The Will und The Stalk hat mich zerstört.

Character 2 [mix]: Oh Gott, ähm, fang gar nicht erst damit an, basically, I had to put the book down and walk around my apartment for 10 minutes.

Character 1 [mix]: Hast du Paper Girls vom selben Autor gelesen?

Character 2 [mix]: Ja! Es ist äh, komplett anders aber, weißt du, equally brilliant, so wie Stranger Things meets Zeitreise, aber geschrieben bevor Stranger Things überhaupt existierte.

Character 1 [mix]: Also, ich hab überlegt, ich meine, mit East of West anzufangen.

Character 2 [mix]: Jonathan Hickmans Sachen sind dicht, aber so lohnend, wenn man sich mal reingearbeitet hat. The world-building in East of West is insane - es ist diese alternative Geschichte, wo der Bürgerkrieg anders endete und die 4 Reiter versuchen die Welt zu beenden.

Character 1 [mix]: Das klingt, eigentlich, wirklich [very sincerely] perfekt für das, was ich, äh, gerade suche.

Character 2 [mix]: [gasp] Warte, ähh, hast du seine Black Monday Murders gelesen? Die Sache ist, it's basically occult noir about banking conspiracies and it's absolutely mind-blowing.

Character 1 [mix]: Hmm, Bankverschwörungen? Das ist irgendwie, jedenfalls, ein ungewöhnliches Thema für Comics.

Character 2 [mix]: Das macht es ja genial! Er nimmt dieses trockene Thema und verwandelt es in diesen dunklen mystischen Thriller. The art by Tomm Coker is all shadows and sharp angles, perfect for the tone.

Character 1 [mix]: Apropos Kunst, [belly laugh] weißt du noch, als ich im College versucht hab, meinen eigenen Comic zu zeichnen?

Character 2 [mix]: Oh Mann, also, deine Strichmännchen-Superhelden-Saga war, denke ich, legendary in its own way, wir zitieren Captain Rectangle manchmal immer noch!

Character 1 [mix]: Captain Rectangle hatte Tiefe! Ehrlich, ich finde immer noch das Konzept war solide, ähm, just the execution needed work.

Character 2 [mix]: Die Ausführung [very loudly] brauchte mehr als nur Arbeit, also wirklich, but I really admired your commitment to that weekly schedule you kept up for 2 whole months!

Character 1 [mix]: 2 Monate pure künstlerische Expression! Liest du noch Monstress?

Character 2 [mix]: Absolut, ah, Marjorie Lius Schreibstil kombiniert mit Sana Takedas Kunst ist Perfektion, es ist nur so dass, every panel looks like it should be framed and hung in a gallery.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: Hey, did you finally pick up that new Sandman volume you were talking about?

Character 2: Not yet! I've been completely absorbed in this series called Saga instead. Have you read it? It's this wild space opera with bounty hunters and star-crossed lovers from warring species.

Character 1: Oh yeah, Saga's incredible! I love Lying Cat.

Character 2: Right? Every time that blue cat says "LYING" I crack up. The way Brian K. Vaughan writes dialogue is so natural and funny, but then he'll hit you with these devastating emotional moments out of nowhere.

Character 1: That issue with The Will and The Stalk destroyed me.

Character 2: Oh god, um, don't even get me started on that, basically, I had to put the book down and walk around my apartment for ten minutes.

Character 1: Have you read Paper Girls by the same author?

Character 2: Yes! It's uh, completely different but, you know, equally brilliant, sort of like Stranger Things meets time travel but written before Stranger Things even existed.

Character 1: Well, I've been thinking about, I mean, starting East of West next.

Character 2: Jonathan Hickman's stuff is dense but so rewarding once you get into it. The world-building in East of West is insane - it's this alternate history where the Civil War ended differently and the Four Horsemen are trying to end the world.

Character 1: That sounds, actually, really [very sincerely] perfect for what I'm, er, looking for right now.

Character 2: [gasp] Wait, uhh, have you read his Black Monday Murders? The thing is, it's basically occult noir about banking conspiracies and it's absolutely mind-blowing.

Character 1: Hmm, banking conspiracies? That's kind of, anyway, an unusual topic for comics.

Character 2: That's what makes it genius! He takes this dry subject and turns it into this dark mystical thriller. The art by Tomm Coker is all shadows and sharp angles, perfect for the tone.

Character 1: Speaking of art, [belly laugh] remember when I tried to draw my own comic in college?

Character 2: Oh man, so, your stick figure superhero saga was, I guess, legendary in its own way, like, we still quote Captain Rectangle sometimes!

Character 1: Captain Rectangle had depth! Honestly, I still think the concept was solid, umm, just the execution needed work.

Character 2: The execution [very loudly] needed more than work, right so, but I really admired your commitment to that weekly schedule you kept up for two whole months!

Character 1: Two months of pure artistic expression! Are you still reading Monstress?

Character 2: Absolutely, ah, Marjorie Liu's writing combined with Sana Takeda's art is perfection, it's just that, every panel looks like it should be framed and hung in a gallery.
