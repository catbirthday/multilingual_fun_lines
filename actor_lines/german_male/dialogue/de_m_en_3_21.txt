Character 1 [en]: Hey, are you running the pool numbers tonight?

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] B-7! Yes indeed, I've got the whole evening shift. It's actually pretty fun once you get into the rhythm of it—much better than changing diapers, I can tell you that!

Character 1 [en]: You're an au pair? How'd you end up doing this?

Character 2 [en]: N-42! The family I work for owns this place, so I help out on weekends for extra cash. The kids are asleep by now anyway, and honestly the tips here are fantastic.

Character 1 [en]: Must be quite a change of pace.

Character 2 [en]: G-19! You have no idea—during the day I'm reading picture books and wiping noses, and at night I'm calling numbers to slightly drunk adults. It's like living two completely different lives.

Character 1 [en]: Which one do you prefer?

Character 2 [en]: O-65! Honestly? Both have their moments. The kids are exhausting but adorable, and this crowd here keeps things entertaining with their superstitions and lucky charms.

Character 1 [en]: Any big winners tonight?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] B-3! Not yet, unfortunately—we had someone come really close about an hour ago but missed by one number. You could see their soul leave their body when they realized.

Character 1 [en]: That's rough. What was the prize?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] N-28! Five hundred dollars cash. Look, if you're thinking about playing, buy your cards now because we're closing sales in ten minutes—house rules, no exceptions.

Character 1 [en]: [yawn] Maybe just one card then.

Character 2 [en]: G-55! Perfect timing, we're about halfway through this round. Just grab a card from the stack there and find yourself a seat—preferably not next to Martha, she gets very territorial about her lucky corner.

Character 1 [en]: Martha sounds intense.

Character 2 [en]: O-71! She's been coming here for fifteen years, same seat, same three cards every time. Claims she won a cruise once back in 2018 and she's been chasing that high ever since.

Character 1 [en]: Has she won anything lately?

Character 2 [en]: B-14! She won a toaster last month and acted like she'd hit the lottery. But hey, that's what makes this job interesting—everyone's got their story, their system, their special dauber.

Character 1 [en]: What number's coming up next?

Character 2 [en]: N-33! And after that, who knows? That's the beauty of it—pure randomness, pure chance, and yet everyone here thinks they've got it figured out somehow.
