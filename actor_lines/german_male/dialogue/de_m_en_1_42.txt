Character 1 [en]: Conceptual art is literally just people being too lazy to learn actual skills.

Character 2 [en]: That's a pretty common reaction, and I get why it might look that way from the outside. But conceptual artists often spend years developing their ideas and theoretical frameworks, which is its own kind of skill.

Character 1 [en]: A banana taped to a wall sold for $120,000. That's not skill, that's a scam.

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, Maurizio Cattelan's piece! Um, I know it seems absurd, but you know, the banana was actually questioning the entire art market system and how we assign value to things, which is pretty clever.

Character 1 [en]: Anyone could tape fruit to a wall. My toddler does it with her snacks.

Character 2 [en]: Your toddler sounds creative! But here's the difference: Cattelan wasn't just taping a banana, he was creating a commentary on commodity, decay, and the absurdity of art valuation itself.

Character 1 [en]: Er, that's just, I mean, fancy words to like justify nonsense.

Character 2 [en]: Honestly, I used to think the same way, uh, but conceptual art is kind of like philosophy made visible. It asks questions rather than providing pretty pictures, challenging how we think about art itself.

Character 1 [en]: So we're supposed to, actually, pay millions for [formal] questions now, hmm?

Character 2 [en]: Not everyone has to [stern] like it or buy it! Art markets are weird and inflated. But dismissing the entire movement ignores how it's shaped everything from advertising to social media.

Character 1 [en]: Well, real artists are [jealous] probably starving while, sort of, these charlatans get rich, anyway.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, that's a real issue, basically, and [cough] the thing is, most conceptual artists are struggling too. Only a tiny fraction make those headline-grabbing sales, while thousands work day jobs to support their practice.

Character 1 [en]: Umm, then why defend it, I guess, when it's right so obviously broken?

Character 2 [en]: Because the ideas [cry] matter even when the market is messed up! Duchamp's urinal changed how we think about authorship, context, and what makes something art versus not-art.

Character 1 [en]: Uhh, a urinal is a urinal, it's just that, and calling it art is really pretentious.

Character 2 [en]: Ha! Here's the thing, though, [laugh] Duchamp would probably agree with you! That was his whole point, showing how context and intention transform objects, which was revolutionary in 1917.

Character 1 [en]: Err, revolutionary is just pushing it, okay so, how is that helping anyone?

Character 2 [en]: Hmmm, think about it this way, anyway, every meme, every remix, pretty much all contemporary culture comes from this idea that context changes meaning.

Character 1 [en]: Memes aren't charging admission to galleries.

Character 2 [en]: True! But, uh, here's what's interesting, honestly, I think conceptual art democratized creativity, you see, by showing that ideas matter more than technical skill, making art accessible to everyone.
