Character 1 [en]: Did you end up fixing that issue with your sourdough starter?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, so, it turns out I was, umm, keeping it way too warm, and, you know, the yeast was basically exhausting itself! Once I moved it to a cooler spot and adjusted the feeding schedule, it started bubbling up beautifully again.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I've been having trouble with, err, mine just not rising properly, like, at all.

Character 2 [en]: That sounds frustrating! Mine went through a sluggish phase too, but switching to a mix of whole wheat and bread flour really gave it the boost it needed. The extra nutrients in whole wheat make such a difference.

Character 1 [en]: So, have you tried, uhh, that [chuckle] Dutch oven method, I mean, that everyone keeps raving about?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, yes! The thing is, [clearing throat] it creates this, you know, perfect steam chamber that, hmm, gives you that incredible crispy crust. The first time I tried it, the bread came out looking like it was from a professional bakery!

Character 1 [en]: Um, my oven runs hot though, so, like, I'm worried about, well, burning the bottom.

Character 2 [en]: Oh, I totally [empathetically] get that concern, honestly, because mine does too! What I do is, err, put a baking sheet on the rack below to deflect some heat, and, you know, it works perfectly.

Character 1 [en]: Right so, the scoring pattern, uhh, does it [bored] really matter that much, or, I guess, is it just aesthetic?

Character 2 [en]: It's actually crucial for controlling how the bread expands! Without proper scoring, the steam escapes randomly and you get these weird bulges instead of a nice even rise.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, what about the, um, hydration percentage you're using these days, like, for your regular loaves?

Character 2 [en]: I've been pushing it up to around 75 percent lately! It makes the dough stickier to work with, but the crumb structure ends up so open and airy, with those gorgeous irregular holes everyone loves.

Character 1 [en]: Well, mine always turns out, you know, super dense no matter what, uhh, hydration I try.

Character 2 [en]: That might be an issue with your gluten development! Are you doing enough stretch and folds during bulk fermentation? I do sets every thirty minutes for the first two hours.

Character 1 [en]: So, the autolyse step, I mean, how long are you, err, actually letting yours sit?

Character 2 [en]: I go for a full hour minimum! Some people say thirty minutes is enough, but that extra time really helps the flour fully hydrate and makes the dough so much easier to handle later.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, um, you add salt [gasp] after the autolyse, like, not before?

Character 2 [en]: Never before! Salt tightens the gluten network too early if you add it at the beginning, which prevents the flour from properly absorbing water during autolyse.

Character 1 [en]: The timing seems so [speeding up] complicated with all these different steps and rest periods.

Character 2 [en]: Honestly, it seems overwhelming at first, but, well, once you get into a rhythm, it's just that, you know, everything flows naturally! I actually find the whole process really meditative now, especially during those long fermentation waits.
