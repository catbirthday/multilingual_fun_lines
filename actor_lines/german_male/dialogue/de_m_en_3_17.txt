Character 1 [en]: Did you seriously just put pineapple on that burger?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, yeah, I—I know it's weird but like, hear me out, okay? There's this whole thing about sweet and savory that just, mmm, it works somehow, you know? Like Hawaiian pizza but, uh, beefier I guess?

Character 1 [en]: That's absolutely disgusting.

Character 2 [en]: Haha, okay okay, so everyone says that at first but then they try it and—well actually no, most people still think it's gross, but I mean, erhm, at least like twenty percent come around to it eventually, which honestly isn't terrible odds when you think about it.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] I-I can't even look at it. The juice is dripping everywhere.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Look, if you're gonna judge my food choices, at least—no wait, that came out wrong. What I meant was, uh, you literally dip your fries in mayo, which is arguably way more offensive to like, the general public's sensibilities, so maybe we just agree to disagree here?

Character 1 [en]: Mayo on fries is a European classic!

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] Yeah, I know, I know... My ex used to say the same thing actually. She was from Belgium and would always, errm, defend it like it was some kind of cultural heritage thing, which I guess it kind of is, but still, it just reminds me of... sorry, that got heavy.

Character 1 [en]: Oh. I didn't mean to bring up—

Character 2 [en]: No no, it's fine, really! I mean, it's been like eight months now so I should probably stop, uhh, connecting literally everything to her, right? Anyway, the pineapple thing actually started way before that—my dad used to grill them when I was a kid and I just, I dunno, got hooked.

Character 1 [en]: Your dad grilled pineapples?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, he was this whole, like, experimental chef wannabe type? Would throw literally anything on the grill to see what happened—watermelon, lettuce, even tried ice cream once which was, oof, exactly as disastrous as you'd imagine, but the pineapple thing actually worked out pretty well.

Character 1 [en]: Ice cream on a grill. That's commitment to chaos.

Character 2 [en]: [gasp softly] Wait, you know what's funny? I just realized I'm basically turning into him—like, last week I tried to make, erhm, bacon-wrapped Oreos in the air fryer and nearly set off every smoke alarm in my apartment complex, which was not my finest moment honestly.

Character 1 [en]: Bacon-wrapped Oreos?

Character 2 [en]: [excited] Yes! Okay so it sounds insane but there's this whole Reddit thread about it and people swear it's amazing! The sweet and salty thing again, plus you get that, mmm, crispy-melty texture contrast that's supposedly incredible, though mine just turned into this like, burnt sugar nightmare situation that took forever to clean.

Character 1 [en]: I'm equally horrified and intrigued.

Character 2 [en]: Right? That's exactly how I felt when I first heard about it! It's like, your brain says absolutely not but then there's this tiny part that goes "but what if though?" and before you know it you're at the grocery store at midnight buying Oreos and wondering, uhh, how you got to this point in your life.

Character 1 [en]: Are you going to try it again?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? Probably, yeah. But maybe with, errr, better ventilation this time? And definitely not at 2 AM when my neighbors are trying to sleep because apparently the fire department showing up is, uh, frowned upon in my building, which seems reasonable in hindsight actually.
