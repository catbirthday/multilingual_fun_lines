Character 1 [en]: So, um, have you been documenting any of those, you know, old farming techniques your grandmother used?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I've been trying to write everything [cough] down before I forget it all. She knew exactly when to plant based on bird migrations and moon phases, never needed a calendar or weather app.

Character 1 [en]: That's incredible. Does it actually work?

Character 2 [en]: It worked for generations before us, and honestly, her harvests were always better than the neighbors who used modern methods. The knowledge is so intricate though - like knowing which insects mean rain is coming three days out.

Character 1 [en]: Er, do you still use any of it, I guess?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I try to, sort of, but I'm losing pieces of it, actually. Yesterday I couldn't remember which bird call meant frost was coming, and that's knowledge that took decades for her to accumulate.

Character 1 [en]: Must be exhausting trying to preserve all that.

Character 2 [en]: It's uhh, [slowly] overwhelming, basically. Every conversation we had contained layers of wisdom about soil health, companion planting, natural pest control - and I only retained fragments of it all.

Character 1 [en]: Why didn't she write it down herself?

Character 2 [en]: She learned it all orally from her mother and grandmother, passed down through stories and hands-on teaching. Writing it down feels like translating poetry into spreadsheet cells - something essential gets lost.

Character 1 [en]: So, have you considered, like, recording yourself talking about it, honestly?

Character 2 [en]: I've started doing audio recordings, which helps [relieved] capture some of the context. But even then, so much was about reading the land itself - the feel of soil between your fingers, the smell of rain coming.

Character 1 [en]: Sounds like embodied knowledge.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly right. She could tell if soil was ready by how it crumbled, predict yields by the color of leaves in spring. These aren't things you can easily document in words or pictures.

Character 1 [en]: What happens when this knowledge disappears?

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, we lose more than techniques - we lose [chuckle] entire worldviews, kind of. Her approach saw the farm as a living system, not a production unit, and that perspective shaped everything from pest management to harvest timing.

Character 1 [en]: Uh, are your kids interested in learning any of this, anyway, I mean?

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, they want to learn, but, you see, they're growing up in a different world, ah. They understand apps better than apple trees, and I'm running out of energy to bridge that gap properly.

Character 1 [en]: That must feel like a huge responsibility.

Character 2 [en]: It's crushing sometimes, knowing I'm the last link to centuries of accumulated wisdom. Every day I forget something else, another remedy or planting rhythm, and it's just gone forever.
