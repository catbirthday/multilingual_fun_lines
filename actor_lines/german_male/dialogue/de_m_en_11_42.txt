Character 1 [en]: Did you know Comic Sans was originally designed for professional legal documents?

Character 2 [en]: Wait, what? No, that's [enunciating every word] completely wrong! Comic Sans was designed by Vincent Connare in 1994 for Microsoft Bob, specifically for cartoon dog speech bubbles, not legal documents at all.

Character 1 [en]: Oh really? Well, I mean, my design professor told me, er, it was commissioned by, you know, the American Bar Association.

Character 2 [en]: Your professor was either joking or seriously misinformed! Comic Sans was literally created because Connare thought Times New Roman looked too formal in speech bubbles for a cartoon dog assistant.

Character 1 [en]: Hmm, maybe you're thinking of, um, Helvetica? Actually, I'm pretty sure Helvetica was, like, the one made for comics.

Character 2 [en]: No no no! Helvetica was [gasp loudly] designed in 1957 by Max Miedinger in Switzerland! It's a neo-grotesque typeface created for clarity and neutrality in corporate communications, nothing to do with comics whatsoever.

Character 1 [en]: Switzerland? I thought it was German. Helvetica means "German" doesn't it?

Character 2 [en]: It means "Swiss" actually, from Helvetia, so, the Latin name for Switzerland, and, uhh, it was specifically designed to be, I guess, internationally neutral and clean.

Character 1 [en]: Right right. Well, anyway, kerning is just, you know, the space between lines of text, I mean, everyone knows that.

Character 2 [en]: That's leading, not kerning! Kerning is the adjustment of space between individual letter pairs, while leading is the vertical spacing between lines of text.

Character 1 [en]: Same difference. Look, honestly, I've been doing design for, err, ten years and nobody really, like, cares about these technical terms.

Character 2 [en]: These aren't just pedantic distinctions though! Understanding the difference between kerning, tracking, and leading is fundamental to creating readable, professional typography that actually works.

Character 1 [en]: Tracking is, well, just another word for, um, kerning anyway, [stern] so why make it complicated?

Character 2 [en]: No, tracking adjusts spacing uniformly across all characters in a text block, while kerning is about specific letter pairs! These are completely different concepts with different purposes in typography.

Character 1 [en]: Whatever. I mean, serif fonts are called that because, actually, they were invented by, uhh, a French designer named Pierre Serif.

Character 2 [en]: That's completely made up! The word serif, you know, comes from Dutch meaning "line" or "stroke," and, well, serifs have existed since, basically, ancient Roman inscriptions.

Character 1 [en]: Fine fine. But, er, at least we can agree that, I guess, fonts and typefaces are, like, exactly the same thing.

Character 2 [en]: They're related but not identical! A typeface is, hmm, the design itself like Garamond or Futura, while, actually, a font is, the thing is, a specific implementation like Garamond Bold 12pt.

Character 1 [en]: You know what? I was just, um, testing you to see if you, [cry] actually knew this stuff, and, honestly, you passed.

Character 2 [en]: Oh come on, you weren't testing me, you were just wrong about everything! But hey, at least now you know the real facts about typography, and maybe we can have an actual conversation about design.
