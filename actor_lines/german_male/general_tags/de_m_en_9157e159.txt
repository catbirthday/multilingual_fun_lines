=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [frozen] I know that, [trembling], stance—the way you're holding that Coltrane record like it's, [barely breathing], sheet music you're about to, [sinking], conduct.

Character 2 [en]: The shop owner's, [stunned], reflection in the vinyl—those eyes are exactly like, [recognition dawning], your mother's were before she, [voice breaking], before everything fell apart.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Twenty years of, [hollow], wondering if you ever thought about the kid you left behind for, [accusatory], Carnegie Hall and European tours and all those, [cracking], standing ovations.

Character 2 [en]: Every single performance ended with me staring at, [heavy], an empty seat in the front row. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [shaking] Mom played your recordings, [choked up], constantly—like maybe if she listened hard enough you'd, [desperate], somehow materialize in our cramped apartment instead of, [resentful], existing only in newspaper clippings.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] I sent money every month but, [ashamed], never had the courage to write a letter or, [regretful], pick up the phone. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: [raw] The money bought groceries but it couldn't, [angry], teach me to ride a bike or show up at, [breaking], parent-teacher conferences or hold me when I had, [whispered], nightmares about being abandoned. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Well, um, the truth is, uh, conducting a hundred musicians felt, [drowning], easier than facing one child I'd failed so, umm, completely. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [cold] You chose Mahler over, [cutting], bedtime stories.

Character 2 [en]: [anguished] Every symphony I conducted was, [haunted], an apology you'd never hear—each movement a letter I was, [guilty], too cowardly to send directly to, [breaking down], you.

Character 1 [en]: So, um, why now—like, why walk into my shop today after, [wavering], two decades of silence when you could've, well, stayed in your concert halls forever?

Character 2 [en]: Because, um, I have terminal cancer and, uhh, I needed to see if maybe, you know, there was still, [faltering], time. [voice breaks]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Time for, um, what exactly—like redemption or, uh, absolution or just, well, clearing your conscience before you go?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Time to learn who you, [pleading], became without me—this incredible person who built something beautiful from, [sobbing], all the wreckage I left, [voice failing], behind. [crying]

Character 1 [en]: Mom died last spring still, [devastated], listening to your recordings.

Character 2 [en]: [crushed] Then I'm twenty years and, [destroyed], one death too late. [silence]

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The Coltrane you're holding—Mom bought it the day you left, [empty], played it every anniversary of your, [fading], disappearance. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [broken] May I, [tentative], buy it?

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Take it—consider it twenty years of, [hollow], birthday presents. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Thank, [grateful], you. [crying softly]
