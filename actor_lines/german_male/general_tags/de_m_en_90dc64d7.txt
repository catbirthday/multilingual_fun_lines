=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] I've been doing this job for fifteen years and I can always, [observant], tell when someone's not ready to let go of, [careful], their loved one's belongings.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, I mean, everything needs to be, [anxious], catalogued and wrapped properly because, um, my mother would never forgive me if anything got, [trembling], damaged even though she's, you know, [voice breaking], not here to see it anymore.

Character 1 [en]: I notice you've been, [understanding], rearranging that same box of china for, well, the past hour like maybe if you get it perfect enough, um, time might stop moving forward.

Character 2 [en]: [tense] These plates were from her wedding and each one has to be, [methodical], positioned exactly right with the tissue paper folded at, [obsessive], precise angles because that's how she taught me to, [shaky], preserve what matters.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Sometimes the heaviest things we carry aren't the, [knowing], furniture but the weight of trying to be perfect for people who loved us anyway.

Character 2 [en]: [struggling] But if I don't do this right, um, if even one thing breaks or gets lost, well, then I've failed her one more time.

Character 1 [en]: [patient] You know, I've watched a lot of people pack up lives and, um, the ones who honor their loved ones best are those who, [thoughtful], forgive themselves for being human while they, [tender], grieve, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: She used to say I spent so much time, [bitter], making sure everything was flawless that I, well, forgot to actually live in the moments and, um, now all I have left are these, [breaking], perfect empty rooms.

Character 1 [en]: [moved] That photo you keep touching on the mantle shows you both, [noticing], laughing with cake batter on your faces which doesn't look very, [warm], perfect to me but absolutely beautiful.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] That was the one time I let her teach me without, [nostalgic], correcting her measurements or insisting on following the recipe exactly.

Character 1 [en]: [encouraging] Maybe she left you more than china and furniture that needs, [meaningful], perfect wrapping—maybe she left you permission to be messy and real.

Character 2 [en]: I keep thinking if I do this perfectly enough, [desperate], somehow it will make up for all the visits I, um, postponed because work needed to be, [regretful], perfect first and now, well, there's no more time for, [crying], visits. [sobs]

Character 1 [en]: [compassionate] Listen, why don't we sit on this old couch for a minute and, um, you can tell me about her while we, [gentle], work because grief doesn't follow a perfect timeline and, well, neither should, [wise], packing up a life.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, okay, I mean, okay.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, I've learned that the things that matter most are usually the ones with, [reflective], chips and stains because those imperfections tell the stories of, well, actual living.

Character 2 [en]: [softening] She always said I was trying to live life like it was a, [sad], museum exhibit instead of a, [realizing], home and maybe she was, [accepting], right all along.

Character 1 [en]: [steady] These boxes we're packing aren't just objects, they're, [profound], permissions she's giving you to finally stop being perfect and start being, you know, whole.

Character 2 [en]: [vulnerable] Could you help me pack this cake plate without, [tearful], wrapping it perfectly because it deserves to remember the mess we made that day?

Character 1 [en]: [smiling] I think that's exactly how she'd want it packed, um, with all the beautiful imperfection of a life, [touching], actually lived and, well, a daughter learning to forgive, [peaceful], herself.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Thank you for seeing what I, um, needed when all I could see were, [grateful], straight lines and right angles that, well, never quite added up to goodbye. [long pause]
