Scenario: A tanker driver on a lonely midnight haul through a desert highway encounters the ghost of a previous driver who died on the same route twenty years ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [startled] Jesus, um, you weren't there a second ago and I mean, [shaking], this cab only has one door so how the hell did you, [confused], get in here while I'm doing seventy on this, [breathless], godforsaken stretch of highway? [nervous laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [hollow] Well, um, I'm always here.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Look, uh, I don't know what kind of, [trembling], hitchhiker game you're playing but, well, I've got eighteen thousand gallons of diesel behind me and I mean, [firm], I don't pick up passengers.

Character 2 [en]: [gentle] You can't pick up someone who's, um, [distant], been dead for twenty years, you know. [sighs softly]

Character 1 [en]: [whispered] What?

Character 2 [en]: My rig jackknifed right at, [fading], mile marker eighty-seven on a night just like this one.

Character 1 [en]: That's impossible.

Character 2 [en]: The company never told you about, [bitter], the accidents on this route, did they?

Character 1 [en]: [reluctant] They said there were some incidents back in the day but nothing, [careful], nothing supernatural or anything like, [nervous], that.

Character 2 [en]: [sad] I've been watching drivers pass through here for two decades now, [weary], some make it and some don't, and tonight I'm, [letting go], worried about you because you're driving, [urgent], exactly like I did that night.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] I mean, what's that supposed to mean—um, I've been driving tankers for, [defensive], fifteen years without so much as a scratch, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [patient] You've been pushing too hard for three days straight and your, [knowing], eyes keep closing for those microseconds that turn into, [grave], forever when you're hauling this much weight at, [soft], this speed.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I need this run.

Character 2 [en]: [understanding] So did I, um, had a family to feed and bills piling up, well, [melancholic], thought I could handle just one more midnight haul, you know, but the road doesn't care about our, [fading], reasons. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [breaking] My daughter needs surgery and the insurance won't, [desperate], cover it without overtime hours.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Pull over at the next rest stop because your daughter needs a, [emphatic], father more than she needs the money from a, [pleading], dead man's final delivery. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: You're saying I'm going to, [terrified], crash tonight if I keep going past mile marker, [shaking], eighty-seven where you, [hollow], died all those years ago.

Character 2 [en]: I'm saying the fog rolls in thick at, [ominous], eighty-seven and the road curves sharper than, [urgent], you remember and your tired mind won't, [desperate], react fast enough when it happens.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Mile marker eighty-five.

Character 2 [en]: [peaceful] Pull over now.
