=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [heavy] The numbers are all here but they feel, [hollow], like we're weighing souls against kilowatts and I can't make them balance anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [quiet] I know.

Character 1 [en]: [tense] Three hundred jobs versus our commitment to, [breaking], go carbon neutral by 2030—how did we let it get to this, [defeated], impossible choice? [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Um, well, I don't know. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Every meeting we've had for six months has been dancing around this, [exhausted], pretending there was some magical third option that would, [bitter], save us from having to decide. [laughs darkly]

Character 2 [en]: You know, um, the thing is, I've been running, [trembling], these models every night for weeks and, well, they all say the same thing. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Tell me there's something we missed, some way to make the factory work with, [pleading], our renewable targets that doesn't involve lying to everyone about the emissions data.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] I mean, umm, we could offset with credits but that's just, [disgusted], moving the pollution somewhere else and pretending it doesn't, [hollow], exist while families here go hungry without those jobs, you know? [groans]

Character 1 [en]: [anguished] So, um, either I betray the workers who've been begging me for, [voice cracking], any opportunity to feed their kids or I betray the planet their kids will, [broken], inherit—God, I mean, how is that even a choice? [crying]

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] Um, it's not, really.

Character 1 [en]: [weary] You know, Sarah's daughter has asthma and she still called me yesterday begging, um, practically begging for us to approve this factory because, [bitter], her unemployment runs out next month and, well, what do I tell her?

Character 2 [en]: The board meeting is tomorrow at nine and, um, they'll want our, [dread], recommendation—unified, professional, like we haven't been tearing ourselves apart over this, you know? [exhales sharply]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] Twenty years I've worked to bring opportunity to this town and now, [empty], everything feels like a betrayal.

Character 2 [en]: We both know what we're going to recommend even though it, [guilty], feels like signing a death warrant either way, don't we?

Character 1 [en]: [determined] I'll draft the approval with every environmental safeguard we can legally require, um, knowing full well they won't be, [defeated], enough but at least we can say we, like, tried.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] Make it clear.

Character 1 [en]: The factory opens in spring and by summer the river will start to, [sickened], smell different and the sunrise will have that industrial haze but three hundred families will, [conflicted], have health insurance and groceries and maybe that's all we can, I mean, manage right now.

Character 2 [en]: [soft] Maybe that's enough.

Character 1 [en]: [haunted] We'll sit in this same room five years from now looking at cancer rates and, [prophetic], respiratory illness statistics and remember this exact moment when we chose economics over, [breaking], ecology.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] And we'll also remember the thank-you cards from families who could finally, [bittersweet], afford Christmas presents. [sighs heavily]
