Scenario: A delegate at a climate summit discovers the motion designer they hired to create their presentation is actually their estranged sibling who they haven't spoken to in five years.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hushed disbelief] Alex? What are you— I mean, the agency said they were sending their best motion designer, but I never imagined it would be you after all this time.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly stunned] Yeah, well, surprise. When I saw your name on the work order, I almost passed it to someone else, but then I thought maybe this was the universe giving us a chance.

Character 1 [en]: A chance for what, exactly? To pretend the last five years didn't happen while you animate graphs about rising sea levels? [exhales] This presentation is for world leaders, Alex.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] I know what it's for, Sam. Believe it or not, I've been following your work since you joined the delegation. That speech you gave in Copenhagen last year was brilliant.

Character 1 [en]: [softening slightly] You watched that? I thought you'd deleted everything connected to me after Dad's funeral, after we said those terrible things to each other.

Character 2 [en]: [wistful] Some connections you can't delete, no matter how hard you try. Look, we have three days to finish this presentation, and honestly, I've already started on some concepts that might surprise you.

Character 1 [en]: Three days. [sighs] Right, okay, let's see what you've got then. But we're keeping this professional, agreed? No digging up old arguments about who abandoned who.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Professional, sure. Though you should know, the central animation I created shows two systems working in opposition until they find synchronicity. Purely metaphorical for climate systems, of course.

Character 1 [en]: [catching the meaning] Of course. Just climate systems. Nothing else implied there at all. Show me this metaphorical masterpiece then. [quieter] And maybe we can grab coffee while we work.

Character 2 [en]: [warming] Coffee sounds great, and yes, I'm staying until we solve this. [chuckles] That's the difference between a fourth visit and, well, getting it right.

Character 1 [en]: You always did have a way of making complex things look simple, even when everything underneath was completely chaotic and unresolved. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [carefully] Speaking of unresolved.

Character 1 [en]: The presentation deadline is what matters now, but maybe after, we could talk about why you really took this job knowing I'd be here. [softer] There must be a reason.

Character 2 [en]: There is.

Character 1 [en]: [almost whispered] I never stopped hoping we'd find our way back to being family again, you know? Even when the silence stretched on for years.

Character 2 [en]: The silence was never complete, Sam. Every project I worked on, I'd imagine showing it to you, wondering if you'd be proud or if you'd have notes like you always did.

Character 1 [en]: [tender smile in voice] I always have notes. But this time, maybe we can work on the revisions together instead of letting them drive us apart.

Character 2 [en]: Together sounds good. Really good, actually. [exhales] So, should we start with the Arctic ice data or the coral reef footage I've been working on?

Character 1 [en]: [brightening] The coral reef footage. You always did understand that beauty moves people more than statistics ever could. That's something I forgot until now. [meaningful pause]

Character 2 [en]: Then let's make something beautiful enough to save the world. And maybe, [sighs], repair a few other broken things along the way.
