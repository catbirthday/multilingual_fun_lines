=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I never thought I'd see you, [stunned], looking this fragile after everything you, [cold], did to destroy my life five years, [measured], ago.

Character 2 [en]: [weak] You came here to what, [exhausted], watch me die with that same, [bitter], analytical mind that made our research so, [trailing off], groundbreaking before I took it?

Character 1 [en]: Um, actually, well, no.

Character 2 [en]: The algorithm you're still, um, bitter about, well, it never worked properly without your, [hollow], contributions anyway. [coughs]

Character 1 [en]: [steady] That's the first honest thing you've, [quiet], said to me since the day you submitted my work under your name. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [rasping] Well, um, karma's funny.

Character 2 [en]: [focused] The fortune I made from selling your research couldn't, [detached], buy me a cure for what's eating me from the inside out. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: Stop playing victim.

Character 1 [en]: [controlled] You destroyed my reputation, um, made me unhirable in the field I loved, and, [tense], now you want me to feel sorry that you're, well, [ice-cold], facing consequences?

Character 2 [en]: [desperate] Um, I know, okay?

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] Every night I see the look on your, [breaking], face when you realized I'd betrayed you, and it haunts me more than, [whispered], this cancer ever could.

Character 1 [en]: [clinical] The data shows that, um, guilt-driven confessions during terminal illness have a, well, [analytical], seventy percent rate of being genuine, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Even now you're analyzing me like I'm just, um, [defeated], another dataset instead of the person who once, I mean, [soft], stayed up all night debugging code with you.

Character 1 [en]: That person died the moment you, [sharp], chose greed over our partnership, over the, [hardening], breakthrough we were supposed to share, over everything we, well, [cracking], built together, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [anguished] I've written you, um, three hundred emails trying to explain, to, well, [desperate], apologize, but I deleted every single one because words can't, you know, [hollow], undo what I stole. [sobs]

Character 1 [en]: [wavering] Three hundred emails means you thought about me every, um, [surprised], day for almost a year, I mean.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] More like every hour since I realized that, um, success without integrity feels exactly like, well, [empty], dying while you're still breathing, you know. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] The prototype we were building together could have, um, revolutionized predictive healthcare, could have, well, [regretful], maybe even detected your cancer earlier, you know.

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] The cruelest irony is that I'm, [fading], dying from something our work might have prevented.

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] I came here to tell you I finally rebuilt everything, um, got hired at a better lab, published new research, but seeing you like, [heavy], this makes all that vindication feel, well, [lost], meaningless somehow, you know. [sighs]
