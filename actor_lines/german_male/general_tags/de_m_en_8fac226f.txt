=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Dad, I've been watching you work these, [proud], docks for twenty years and I finally understand that what you do here, [earnest], matters more than any business degree ever, [resolute], could.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] You're standing here in your, [disbelief], college clothes telling me you want to throw away everything I've, [breaking], worked for just to end up with broken hands and a, [hollow], bent back like mine?

Character 1 [en]: Well, I mean, the thing is that sitting in those, [frustrated], lecture halls feels like I'm suffocating while you're out here actually, [admiring], building something real with your hands, um, something that keeps the whole city, [passionate], running.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Um, you think there's honor in this? Well, there's just pain, [defeated], son—pain that starts in your shoulders and spreads everywhere else.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Every container you move feeds families, keeps hospitals stocked, [reverent], brings life to this entire city, Dad.

Character 2 [en]: I didn't break my body for, um, thirty years so you could romanticize poverty and, [angry], physical labor—I did it so you'd never have to know what it, well, feels like.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] But you never understood that watching you come home exhausted but, [emotional], proud taught me more about dignity than any classroom ever could.

Character 2 [en]: [weary] Pride doesn't pay for surgery when your back gives out at, [heavy], fifty-two and you can't lift your grandchildren anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Um, but Dad, I'm drowning in that university, [trembling], pretending to care about spreadsheets while, well, you're out here doing something that actually matters.

Character 2 [en]: [firm] What matters is you getting a degree that opens, [measured], doors I could never even knock on, son.

Character 1 [en]: [passionate] Well, I mean, those doors lead to offices where people like you are just, [bitter], numbers on a logistics report, where they've never once considered the, um, human being operating that loader in the rain at, [voice breaking], four in the morning. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, you think I don't know that? I've been invisible my whole, [hollow], life, well, except to you and your mother.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] That's exactly why, um, I want to stand beside you—because someone needs to, [fierce], see you, to understand that what you do is, well, heroic even if the world refuses to, [proud], acknowledge it. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [cracking] Well, son, um, heroic is a word for people in movies, not for, [choked], men who just show up because, uh, someone has to.

Character 1 [en]: [tender] Um, showing up every day despite the pain, despite being invisible, well, that's the most, [earnest], heroic thing I've ever witnessed, and I mean, I want to learn that kind of, [resolute], strength from you. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered] Well, I can't.

Character 1 [en]: Can't what, Dad—can't let me honor what you've, [confused], built or can't believe that your work has, [searching], value beyond the paycheck?

Character 2 [en]: [broken] Um, I can't watch you choose my life when I spent, [trembling], every hour of overtime trying to make sure you'd never, well, have to, when your mother and I dreamed you'd wear a tie, not, [defeated], steel-toed boots. [crying]

Character 1 [en]: [soft] Well, maybe, um, the greatest gift you gave me wasn't the, [thoughtful], chance to escape this life but the ability to see its, [proud], dignity, to choose it freely instead of being, well, trapped by it. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Um, if you do this, well, if you really walk away from college to work these docks, [heavy], you better be damn sure, son.
