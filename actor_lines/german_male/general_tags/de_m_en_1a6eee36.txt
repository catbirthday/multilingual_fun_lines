=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [nervous] Um, I never thought I'd be sitting here, well, [confused], in a lawyer's office discussing whether saving lives could somehow be, you know, illegal. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [professional] The Sherman Act doesn't, [measured], care about good intentions—it cares about market dominance and whether you've, [careful], prevented others from competing in what the DOJ is calling, [clinical], the 'heroic services sector.' [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] But I mean, um, we're not selling widgets here, we're, [desperate], literally pulling people from burning buildings and stopping alien invasions—how is that, [incredulous], a market that needs competition? [exhales]

Character 2 [en]: [calm] Your agency controls ninety-three percent of all, [steady], emergency response contracts in the metropolitan area, which, [gentle], from a legal standpoint creates what we call, [explaining], monopolistic conditions regardless of your noble purposes.

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, the reason we have those contracts is because, [bitter], smaller hero teams kept getting people killed trying to, [haunted], handle threats they weren't equipped for—I mean, [breaking], we had to consolidate for public safety.

Character 2 [en]: [understanding] I hear you.

Character 1 [en]: You know, um, every single merger and acquisition we made was to, [defensive], save lives more efficiently, not to, well, [exhausted], corner some market. [groans]

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtful] Um, I believe you, and well, [reassuring], that's exactly the narrative we need to build. [nodding]

Character 1 [en]: [hopeful] The irony is that we've been so successful at, [proud], protecting this city that now we're being punished for it.

Character 2 [en]: [strategic] Success itself isn't illegal, but the methods by which you've, [careful], achieved market dominance might be problematic.

Character 1 [en]: I mean, um, what were we supposed to do—let incompetent heroes, [angry], keep operating just so there'd be competition while civilians, [voice cracking], died in the crossfire, you know?

Character 2 [en]: [diplomatic] Well, um, the government's position is that you could have, [explaining], partnered with or trained those smaller teams instead of, you know, [delicate], acquiring or forcing them out. [clears throat]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] We tried partnerships first but most of them couldn't, [tired], meet our safety standards or refused to follow protocols that, [firm], we knew saved lives based on decades of, [heavy], experience in the field.

Character 2 [en]: [practical] Um, I mean, we need to document all those partnership attempts because, well, [focused], showing good faith efforts to collaborate before consolidation could, [optimistic], significantly strengthen our defense position.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Um, well, the press is already calling us a monopoly and saying we've, [hurt], betrayed the public trust by eliminating choice—I mean, [desperate], how do we fight that narrative while also, [worried], keeping the city safe? [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [confident] We reframe this entirely—you're not a monopoly, you're, [persuasive], a public utility that happens to wear capes and, [warming], save lives instead of delivering electricity. [smiles]

Character 1 [en]: [curious] That's actually brilliant because utilities are regulated but, [realizing], allowed to maintain market dominance for the public good—so we'd be, [hopeful], acknowledging our position while justifying it legally. [laughs softly]

Character 2 [en]: Exactly—we position your agency as, [steady], essential infrastructure rather than a competitive business, which, [building momentum], changes the entire legal framework we're operating within.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] You know, um, I came in here expecting to be told we'd have to, [grateful], break up the team but instead you're, well, [emotional], actually fighting for what we've built. [voice catching]

Character 2 [en]: [sincere] Well, um, my job isn't to destroy heroes—it's to, [determined], ensure they can keep saving lives within the law. [firmly]
