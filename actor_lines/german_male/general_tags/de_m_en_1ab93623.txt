=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Um, I've been tracking these, [stunned], identities for seven years—Marcus Chen, Elena Vasquez, David Cross—and, well, they're all you, aren't they? [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [en]: [defiant] So you finally, um, [amused], figured it out, though I have to say, [impressed], it took you longer than I expected, I mean, for someone in your line of work.

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] All of them, you.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Every seventy years I have to, [weary], reinvent myself completely because mortals get suspicious when you don't, [frustrated], age like they expect, when your references from 1953 are still, [sardonic], mysteriously alive and willing to vouch for you.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] The fingerprints never matched but the, [confused], bone structure in every photo was identical, and I thought I was, [breaking], going insane. [laughs nervously]

Character 2 [en]: You weren't going insane—you were just, [gentle], the first person thorough enough to notice the pattern.

Character 1 [en]: [accusatory] Well, um, I flagged you as a potential, [tense], terrorist cell because, I mean, who else creates that many false identities except someone, [desperate], planning something terrible?

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] Um, yeah, someone who's been alive since, [bitter], the Bronze Age and just wants to, well, have a normal job and pay taxes like everyone else.

Character 1 [en]: [disbelieving] You're telling me that you're actually, [shaking], thousands of years old and you just want to work at, [incredulous], a marketing firm?

Character 2 [en]: [resigned] Even demigods need health insurance these, [dry], days. [sighs heavily]

Character 1 [en]: Well, um, the FBI has been, [nervous], investigating you for three years because of my reports, and, I mean, [guilty], they think you're running some kind of, [panicked], elaborate identity theft ring.

Character 2 [en]: [alarmed] Um, wait, the FBI is, [horrified], involved now because that's exactly the kind of, [frantic], attention that forces me to disappear again, and, well, I really like this city.

Character 1 [en]: [conflicted] I can't just make three years of, [struggling], investigation disappear without questions. [groans]

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] Well, um, what if I showed you, [hesitant], something that would make you understand?

Character 1 [en]: [wary] Every con artist I've ever investigated has promised to, [skeptical], show me something that changes everything. [scoffs]

Character 2 [en]: [determined] This isn't a con—watch my hand, [commanding], carefully.

Character 1 [en]: [gasping] Um, your hand is literally, [amazed], glowing with golden light and, well, I can feel the, [overwhelmed], air getting warmer like standing next to the sun.

Character 2 [en]: Um, my father is Helios, and, [soft], every sunrise you've ever seen is partly his doing, I mean, partly mine too. [pauses]

Character 1 [en]: [awestruck] So, um, everything I thought I knew about, [lost], reality just shattered, and, well, I don't know whether to, [conflicted], call this in or delete every file I've ever written about you.

Character 2 [en]: All I've ever wanted was to live quietly among, [melancholic], humans and experience what mortality feels like secondhand. [whispers]
