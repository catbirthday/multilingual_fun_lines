=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Those scars on your hands from the, [recognizing], blast powder burns—I've seen them before on someone who, [voice breaking], used to build sandcastles with me before the waves took everything, [quieter], we knew.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Well, I mean, lots of people have scars from, [uncomfortable], working with explosives so, um, that doesn't mean anything about who I was before I became good at, er, breaking things apart. [shifts nervously]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] You still tap your fingers in that same, [emotional], rhythm when you're nervous—three quick, two slow—just like you did on the, [trembling], lifeboat while we watched our parents' ship go under. [long pause]

Character 2 [en]: [hollow] Um, well, I don't, er, remember.

Character 1 [en]: [anguished] Don't lie to me because I spent fifteen, [broken], years searching every port from here to the Cape of Storms wondering if you, [choking up], survived that night when I lost my grip on your hand in those, [shaking], black waters. [voice cracks]

Character 2 [en]: [yielding] I survived by, um, forgetting—by becoming someone who, [bitter], breaks things instead of someone who got broken, you know? [exhales sharply]

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] But you're here now on my ship which, I mean, has to mean something after all this, [searching], time spent thinking you were dead while I, um, turned into this monster our father would've, [ashamed], hated.

Character 2 [en]: [insecure] Maybe I came because, well, I heard stories about a pirate captain who, [vulnerable], raids merchant ships but never kills the crews and I thought, um, maybe that sounded like someone trying to, [whispered], hold onto something good despite, er, drowning in darkness.

Character 1 [en]: [broken] Well, um, I tried.

Character 2 [en]: The thing is, I mean, I've spent so many years, [haunted], perfecting the art of destruction that I forgot what it felt like to, [lost], build something or, um, belong somewhere.

Character 1 [en]: [gentle] You belonged with me once and, well, maybe you could again if we can figure out how to, [hopeful], stop drowning in what we've become and, um, remember who we were before the ocean, er, took everything. [sighs heavily]

Character 2 [en]: [uncertain] Every explosion I set reminds me of the sound that ship made when it, [traumatized], split in half.

Character 1 [en]: [raw] Some nights I still wake up tasting, [drowning], salt water and feeling your fingers slip away while the current, [anguished], pulled us apart. [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: [surrendering] I became an expert at breaking things because, well, it felt like the only thing I could, [tired], control after that night, you know?

Character 1 [en]: And I became a pirate because taking from others felt, [hollow], easier than admitting everything had been, [defeated], taken from me.

Character 2 [en]: So here we are, um, two broken people on a stolen ship pretending we're not still, [drowning], drowning, I mean. [laughs bitterly]

Character 1 [en]: [determined] But we're not drowning anymore because we found each other and, well, maybe that's enough to, [fierce], start rebuilding what the sea destroyed even if, um, we're different people now than the children who, [softer], held hands in that lifeboat.

Character 2 [en]: [crying] Um, well, I—I missed you.

Character 1 [en]: [overwhelmed] God, I searched every face in every port hoping to, [voice cracking], see those same eyes that used to look at me like I could, [broken], protect you from anything when really I couldn't even, [whispered], hold on tight enough. [sobs]

Character 2 [en]: [accepting] Maybe we both had to, um, become these damaged versions of ourselves—you the pirate, me the breaker—to, [understanding], survive long enough to find our way back to each other through, well, all this wreckage we've, [peaceful], created. [exhales slowly]
