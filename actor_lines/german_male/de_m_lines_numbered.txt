============================================================

1. Oh oh oh, okay so, um, let me just—wait, actually—let me pull up your account here real quick and, uh, basically we're gonna figure this out together, alright? So I'm seeing account number BUS-44729-QX here, is that, um, is that the right one for your bakery?
2. Oooh, bakery owner, yeah so like, between you and me? I totally get it—my sister runs a café and she's she's always exhausted. So, um, I'm looking at transaction TXN-892341-K and it shows, uh, initiated yesterday at 3:47pm but then there's this weird—hmm—okay so basically there's like a hold code HC-7749 that shouldn't be there.
3. Right right, no I see exactly what happened—so the the payment processor flagged it because, um, and this is kinda ridiculous but, uh, the amount was like $4,444.44 and their system thought it was, er, suspicious? Which is—I mean—that's silly but reference number REF-20847-AAB shows it got caught in their, um, their fraud filter.
4. Exactly!
5. Okay so—and don't don't worry, we're gonna fix this—um, between you and me? I can bypass their silly filter. So basically I'm putting in override code OVR-55821-MNX right now and, uh, marking this vendor VND-3847 as pre-approved so like, this won't happen again next month, you know?
6. Well well well, technically I need supervisor approval but, um, looking at your history here—transaction log TL-98234 shows, uh, perfect payments for six years straight so, er, yeah I'm just gonna—I'm gonna push this through. The payment should should release in, hmm, about fifteen minutes with confirmation PCF-77439-D.
7. Yep yep, absolutely sure, and and actually? I'm also gonna—hold on—I'm gonna add priority flag PF-2288 which means, um, if anything goes wrong, which it won't, but if it does, you'd get an instant callback from from our escalation team.
8. No no, you're absolutely right to be frustrated! Like, the system flagging $4,444.44 as suspicious when, uh, when I can literally see here in your vendor history VH-66290-K that it's the same payment every single month? That's on us, not you.
9. Promise promise promise. So, um, I've set up notification alert NA-88451-QQZ to ping your phone the the second it goes through, and, uh, between you and me? I put a note in vendor file VF-3847 that basically says "priority customer - no holds ever" so, er, my supervisor might not love that but, you know, six years of loyalty means something.
10. Hey so, um, one more thing—I'm also adding courtesy credit CC-9982-XV for for the inconvenience, it's not much but, uh, it'll show up as a $25 credit next billing cycle, and and honestly? After being up since 4am dealing with our mistake, you deserve way more than that but, er, that's the max I can do without without getting in trouble. You should get confirmation text CT-44519 in about, hmm, two minutes showing everything's processing.
11. Oh, I absolutely understand your concern, and um, thank you for being such a loyal customer with us. Let me, uh, pull up your account here... what's the word... your member number ends in 4782, right? So I'm seeing some transactions here and, hmm, I want to make sure we get this sorted out for you right away.
12. Okay, so um, I'm looking at transaction ID TXN-892341-GS here, and, uh, this is actually a really common thing that confuses folks. What you're seeing is... hmm, one is what we call a pending transaction and the other is the, um, posted transaction, and they'll sort of...
13. Oh no no, I completely understand why it looks that way, and um, you're absolutely not being charged twice, I promise. So what happens is, uh, when you swipe your card at the gas station, they put a... what's the word... a temporary hold for like $100 or $125, that's the pending one with reference PND-8923-A, and then the actual amount you pumped...
14. Exactly, exactly.
15. Oh please don't feel that way at all! Honestly, um, this is probably the most common question we get, and the way it displays in the app is, uh, really confusing. I've actually, hmm, submitted feedback about this myself because, um, at least three or four people call about this every single day.
16. Not at all, not even close! Um, so here's what I can do for you - I can, uh, send you a little guide we have, document number DOC-7823-EDU, that explains the whole, um, pending versus posted thing with some examples. And honestly? My own mom called me about this exact same thing last month...
17. No trouble whatsoever! I'm, um, already getting that queued up to your email on file. And, uh, just so you know for future reference, those pending charges usually drop off in, hmm, 2-3 business days, sometimes faster depending on the merchant.
18. Well, um, I wouldn't say completely ignore them, because they do, uh, affect your available balance temporarily. So like, if you have $500 in your account and there's a $100 pending charge, you can really only spend, hmm, $400 until it clears. That's where people sometimes get caught...
19. Right? Yeah, it's um, it's one of those banking things that really should be explained better. Your actual balance in account ending 4782 is, uh, let me see here... $1,247.82, but your available balance is showing, hmm, $1,122.82 because of that pending gas charge.
20. Oh my goodness, please, you have nothing to apologize for! Um, this is exactly what I'm here for, and honestly, you've been lovely to talk with. Is there, uh, anything else about your account or those transactions that I can help clarify? I've got your case number saved as CSE-9923-XM if you need to reference this call later...
21. Right right. So I can pull that up—let me just—actually your account number ending in 4782, I see the adjustment here from October 15th.
22. So the thing is—wait, let me—okay so basically, um, the system flagged account ACT-4782-MK for, uh, what we call a periodic review, and um, based on the credit report pull CRB-892341, there were some changes.
23. I understand, and um, so like, the report shows—er, let me be specific here—three new, uh, credit inquiries in September and, um, your utilization across all cards jumped to, uh, 78%.
24. Got it.
25. I know this is—I mean, um, I'm really sorry about—actually let me, uh, look at what options—so your new limit in system code LMT-4782-R2 is $3,000, down from, er, $8,000.
26. Right, so you're at $4,200 currently, which means—and I know this isn't ideal—but that puts you overlimit by $1,200.
27. No no, you don't—I mean, we're not demanding immediate payment. The system note SNT-445692 shows you have until your next statement date, November 22nd, to bring it under.
28. And actually—um, wait, I'm seeing—so there's a, uh, hardship program code HRD-789-TEMP that I could, er, potentially apply if you're, um, experiencing temporary financial difficulty?
29. Absolutely.
30. So I've added note CSN-445693-H to start that process. You'll get an email within 24 hours with the hardship application, and once approved, we can work on more manageable terms.
31. Oh hey there! Um, let me just, uh—sorry, let me pull that up. Account number ACS-4492-BN7. Okay. So. Between you and me? These auto-renewals are, um, kind of sneaky.
32. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So what I'm seeing here is, uh, transaction TXN-885421-QW. It's—wait no, sorry—that's the wrong one. Here we go. TXN-885423-QW. Looks like it, um, it kind of hibernated? Then reactivated.
33. Totally get it. I mean, uh, honestly? I'd probably think the same thing. Let me, er, let me show you something cool though. Reference code REF-2234-XKL9. That's your original signup. See the gap?
34. Right right. Exactly.
35. So, um, technically—and I'm kind of, uh, not supposed to say this—but they did send an email to, er, let me check... is it still the hotmail address? MSG-ID-7789-PLK2? But, um, between us? Those emails are, uh, pretty easy to miss.
36. Oh absolutely. Like, um, super shady. Here's what I'm gonna do though. I'm, uh—I mean, I think I can—let me just... okay. Refund authorization RFD-9982-MNX1. Full amount. Plus, um, kind of throwing in next month free if you want to keep it?
37. So here's the, um, here's the insider trick. Ready? I'm putting a note—NOTE-4451-BVX9—that says, uh, "manual renewal only." That means it literally, er, it can't charge you unless you physically call us.
38. Ah. Good question. Um, so I'm actually, uh, I'm gonna send you confirmation code CNF-8827-TTR3. Screenshot that. If anyone ever, um, tries anything? That's like your, uh, your get-out-of-jail-free card. That code means I personally guaranteed it.
39. Ugh, yeah. Some reps are, um, they're really by-the-book. But like, er, customer loyalty code CLY-3398-QQZ1? That's going on your account too. That basically means you get, uh, you get the cool rep treatment from now on.
40. So, um, refund hits in, uh, three to five days. Processing number PRC-6671-AAL2. And yeah! Screenshot, er, screenshot everything. Oh and, um, one more thing? Check your email. Not the hotmail. I'm sending you, uh, my direct extension. Just in case.
41. Oh okay, I can definitely help you figure that out, let me just pull up your account here real quick—what's the amount showing on that charge?
42. Alright so, um, forty-seven fifty, and I'm seeing here—hmm, that's interesting actually—so sometimes, uh, companies process payments under their sort of, um, corporate entity name which might be different from what you know them as, let me check transaction ID TXN-892445-QR7 here.
43. Right right, so like, um, think of it this way—you know how, uh, sometimes McDonald's might show up as like "MCD Franchise 4521" or something? It's kinda the same thing, um, let me just search this merchant ID MER-7783-DCS and see what they actually...
44. Exactly! Yes! So, um, Digital Commerce Solutions—that's weird though because usually I can find these pretty quick—uh, let me try a different lookup, maybe reference number REF-20241105-847, and, um, did you maybe purchase anything online recently, like in the last few days?
45. Pet supplies, perfect, that actually helps narrow it down quite a bit.
46. Oh! Okay so, um, I think I found it—PetWorld Plus, they actually, uh, process through—yep, here it is—transaction code TXN-847766-PWP shows Digital Commerce Solutions as their, um, payment processor, so that's probably what you're seeing there.
47. I know, right? It's honestly kind of, um, annoying how they do that—like I get probably twenty calls a day about this exact thing—uh, basically these companies use third-party processors and, um, your confirmation should be order ORD-9944-PWP if you still have that email?
48. Aw thanks, honestly you're being really patient about it, some people get pretty upset when they see charges they don't recognize.
49. Perfect! Yeah so that's, um, definitely your PetWorld order then, and I'm gonna, uh, make a note here in case you need to reference this later—ticket number TKT-558831-CS—just in case you need to, um, you know, look back at this or anything.
50. Ha! Pretty much, yeah—credit card detective, that's actually not the worst description of this job I've heard, and at least this one had a happy ending with finding your pet supplies order!
51. Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear about that double charge, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—hmm—if you could give me your, um, account number or the order reference?
52. Okay so, um, I'm looking at order FED-4782-XR and, uh, yes I can definitely see the issue here—there's, um, two charges on October 15th for $1,847 each and that's, er, obviously not right.
53. I, um, I really wish I could just reverse this right away but, uh, unfortunately with feed supplier charges over $1,500, I need to, er, submit this to our billing disputes team with reference code DSP-9847-K.
54. I know, I know, it's, um, it's really frustrating and I'm, uh, genuinely sorry about the process here—the dispute team usually, er, takes about 3-5 business days to review these and, um, then they'll issue the refund.
55. So, ummm, I can see you've been a customer since, uh, 2019 and this is, er, actually your first billing issue which—um—I'm going to note that in the dispute file DSP-9847-K to hopefully, you know, expedite things a bit.
56. Right, right, and, um, that's exactly why this shouldn't have happened—let me, uh, also add a priority flag here and, er, actually I'm seeing the supplier code is SUP-447 which, hmm, they've had similar issues recently.
57. Well, I, um, I can't speak to other accounts but, uh, let's just say your case reference DSP-9847-K is, er, going to include some additional notes about, um, pattern concerns with vendor SUP-447.
58. Unfortunately, um, for the actual refund, yes, but, uh, what I can do right now is, er, issue you a credit memo CMO-7739-PL for the duplicate amount that you can, um, apply to your next order immediately if you need to place one.
59. So, um, you'll definitely get the actual refund—that's, uh, guaranteed with case DSP-9847-K—but the credit memo CMO-7739-PL is, er, just if you need to order more feed before the refund processes, so you're not, um, you know, out double the cash.
60. Absolutely, so, um, I've got everything submitted now—you'll get an email with, uh, both reference numbers DSP-9847-K and CMO-7739-PL, and, er, honestly if it's not resolved by Thursday, please call back and, um, specifically ask for escalation to management, okay?
61. Oh absolutely! I'm actually, you know, following this [enunciating every word] sixteen-week program that, well, builds up to about fifteen hours of training per week. The long bike rides on weekends are hitting 80 to 100 miles now!
62. It does sound intense, but honestly, when you break it down into, er, daily chunks, it's manageable! Like, I'm doing maybe two hours on weekdays, then those longer sessions on weekends, and, you know, it all adds up to those fifteen hours pretty naturally.
63. Sprint triathlons are perfect for beginners though! We're talking, hmm, just a 750-meter swim, which is about, you know, fifteen minutes in the pool, then a 20-kilometer bike ride, and finishing with a 5K run.
64. The swim starts can be chaotic, but here's the thing, most races now offer, um, wave starts with only 50 to 75 people going at once! Plus, err, there's always the option to start at the back and, basically, take your time finding your rhythm.
65. For first-timers, I'd say, well, [apologetic] anywhere from 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours is totally respectable! Actually, my first sprint took me, uhh, 1 hour and 47 minutes, and I was thrilled just to finish!
66. Exactly double! So that's 1,500 meters swimming, 40 kilometers biking, and a 10K run. Most people finish those in 2.5 to 3.5 hours depending on their fitness level and the course difficulty.
67. You can definitely start with basics for under $500 total! A decent used bike for $300, goggles for $20, running shoes around $100, and maybe $50 for tri shorts gives you everything you need.
68. Yeah, the gear rabbit hole is real! But honestly, at our level, training matters so much more than equipment. I mean, upgrading from a $500 bike to that $5,000 one might save you, uhh, maybe 3 to 5 minutes over 40 kilometers.
69. The golden rule is about 200 to 300 calories per hour for anything over 90 minutes! I usually, well, aim for 250 calories hourly through, you know, a mix of sports drinks and gels, which keeps my energy steady.
70. Most Ironman races have a 17-hour cutoff from the start, with specific timing gates along the way. Sprint and Olympic distances are way more relaxed though, usually allowing 3 to 4 hours total, which gives everyone plenty of time to finish!
71. Yeah, they're completely abandoning the B2B model [very sincerely] and going direct-to-consumer like Slack did back in 2013. It's a huge shift from enterprise sales to self-service signups, which could either be brilliant or catastrophic.
72. That was the original plan, but apparently leadership got spooked by our burn rate and customer acquisition costs. They're looking at how Twitter pivoted from podcasting platform Odeo to microblogging and thinking we need that kind of dramatic shift.
73. I know, and [very meekly] that's the part that really bothers me about this whole thing. Those people relocated their families, and now they're being told their entire role might not exist in six months.
74. Netflix's pivot from DVDs to streaming was gradual and strategic over several years though. What we're doing feels more like Instagram's overnight pivot from Burbn, just ripping the band-aid off completely.
75. He did say that recognizing when to pivot is crucial for startup survival. But he also had a clear vision - Burbn was too complicated, so they simplified to just photo-sharing, which became a billion-dollar idea.
76. Groupon's [laugh hard] multiple failed pivots are, well, definitely a cautionary tale! They went from, you know, collective action platform to daily deals to, uhh, whatever they're trying to be now - a marketplace, delivery service, basically everything at once.
77. Based on yesterday's all-hands, the thing is, they seem to be, hmm, cherry-picking success stories without, really, considering why PayPal's pivot from Palm Pilot payments worked while, err, Friendster's pivot attempts failed miserably.
78. That's exactly the problem - our infrastructure is, actually, optimized for long sales cycles and, you know, high-touch onboarding. Pivoting to self-service means, well, rebuilding everything from scratch, honestly, just like when Flickr pivoted from that game, umm, Game Neverending.
79. From what I'm [whispering loudly] hearing through the grapevine, they're trying to avoid layoffs by retraining people. But realistically, converting enterprise sales folks to growth hackers isn't exactly a smooth transition.
80. True! Stewart Butterfield did pull off that pivot twice - first with Flickr, then with Slack from Tiny Speck. Maybe there's hope for us yet, though I'd feel better if our leadership had his track record.
81. Hey, what's going on with it? Sometimes the best pieces come from just letting go of what you think it should look like and embracing what it wants to become.
82. Dreams are tricky to translate visually, that's for sure. Have you tried using different materials, maybe mixing media or working with your non-dominant hand to break out of the pattern?
83. Okay, I get it, [sigh], this is really frustrating you. But remember when you were stuck on that sculpture last year and then suddenly it all clicked when you stopped forcing it?
84. But look, the thing is, that piece ended up being, [friendly], your best work! Maybe you should, well, try approaching this one through movement first, like, dance out the feeling and then paint?
85. No no no, hear me out! There's this whole thing called authentic movement where you let your body express what words and images can't quite capture yet.
86. It's not about being a good dancer, actually, it's about, you know, letting your body process the emotion first, and then, basically, translating that physical experience onto canvas.
87. Who cares what they think? Look, hmm, creative blocks happen when we're, kind of, too much in our heads, and, I guess, movement can bypass that analytical part.
88. Deal! And honestly, even if it doesn't work for the painting, at least you'll have gotten some of that tension out of your body.
89. Well then, we should [overly polite] definitely get you moving soon! But seriously, when you're this wound up, art becomes forced instead of flowing, and that never ends well.
90. Exactly! And, well, if nothing else, we can, er, laugh about you dancing around your studio, but, the thing is, I've seen this work for so many blocked artists.
91. Wait, what? No, that's [enunciating every word] completely wrong! Comic Sans was designed by Vincent Connare in 1994 for Microsoft Bob, specifically for cartoon dog speech bubbles, not legal documents at all.
92. Your professor was either joking or seriously misinformed! Comic Sans was literally created because Connare thought Times New Roman looked too formal in speech bubbles for a cartoon dog assistant.
93. No no no! Helvetica was [gasp loudly] designed in 1957 by Max Miedinger in Switzerland! It's a neo-grotesque typeface created for clarity and neutrality in corporate communications, nothing to do with comics whatsoever.
94. It means "Swiss" actually, from Helvetia, so, the Latin name for Switzerland, and, uhh, it was specifically designed to be, I guess, internationally neutral and clean.
95. That's leading, not kerning! Kerning is the adjustment of space between individual letter pairs, while leading is the vertical spacing between lines of text.
96. These aren't just pedantic distinctions though! Understanding the difference between kerning, tracking, and leading is fundamental to creating readable, professional typography that actually works.
97. No, tracking adjusts spacing uniformly across all characters in a text block, while kerning is about specific letter pairs! These are completely different concepts with different purposes in typography.
98. That's completely made up! The word serif, you know, comes from Dutch meaning "line" or "stroke," and, well, serifs have existed since, basically, ancient Roman inscriptions.
99. They're related but not identical! A typeface is, hmm, the design itself like Garamond or Futura, while, actually, a font is, the thing is, a specific implementation like Garamond Bold 12pt.
100. Oh come on, you weren't testing me, you were just wrong about everything! But hey, at least now you know the real facts about typography, and maybe we can have an actual conversation about design.
101. [hollow] Well, um, I'm always here.
102. [gentle] You can't pick up someone who's, um, [distant], been dead for twenty years, you know. [sighs softly]
103. My rig jackknifed right at, [fading], mile marker eighty-seven on a night just like this one.
104. The company never told you about, [bitter], the accidents on this route, did they?
105. [sad] I've been watching drivers pass through here for two decades now, [weary], some make it and some don't, and tonight I'm, [letting go], worried about you because you're driving, [urgent], exactly like I did that night.
106. [patient] You've been pushing too hard for three days straight and your, [knowing], eyes keep closing for those microseconds that turn into, [grave], forever when you're hauling this much weight at, [soft], this speed.
107. [understanding] So did I, um, had a family to feed and bills piling up, well, [melancholic], thought I could handle just one more midnight haul, you know, but the road doesn't care about our, [fading], reasons. [long pause]
108. [firm] Pull over at the next rest stop because your daughter needs a, [emphatic], father more than she needs the money from a, [pleading], dead man's final delivery. [voice breaking]
109. I'm saying the fog rolls in thick at, [ominous], eighty-seven and the road curves sharper than, [urgent], you remember and your tired mind won't, [desperate], react fast enough when it happens.
110. [peaceful] Pull over now.
111. [weak] You came here to what, [exhausted], watch me die with that same, [bitter], analytical mind that made our research so, [trailing off], groundbreaking before I took it?
112. The algorithm you're still, um, bitter about, well, it never worked properly without your, [hollow], contributions anyway. [coughs]
113. [rasping] Well, um, karma's funny.
114. [focused] The fortune I made from selling your research couldn't, [detached], buy me a cure for what's eating me from the inside out. [sighs]
115. [desperate] Um, I know, okay?
116. [trembling] Every night I see the look on your, [breaking], face when you realized I'd betrayed you, and it haunts me more than, [whispered], this cancer ever could.
117. [frustrated] Even now you're analyzing me like I'm just, um, [defeated], another dataset instead of the person who once, I mean, [soft], stayed up all night debugging code with you.
118. [anguished] I've written you, um, three hundred emails trying to explain, to, well, [desperate], apologize, but I deleted every single one because words can't, you know, [hollow], undo what I stole. [sobs]
119. [exhausted] More like every hour since I realized that, um, success without integrity feels exactly like, well, [empty], dying while you're still breathing, you know. [long pause]
120. [resigned] The cruelest irony is that I'm, [fading], dying from something our work might have prevented.
121. [professional] The Sherman Act doesn't, [measured], care about good intentions—it cares about market dominance and whether you've, [careful], prevented others from competing in what the DOJ is calling, [clinical], the 'heroic services sector.' [pause]
122. [calm] Your agency controls ninety-three percent of all, [steady], emergency response contracts in the metropolitan area, which, [gentle], from a legal standpoint creates what we call, [explaining], monopolistic conditions regardless of your noble purposes.
123. [understanding] I hear you.
124. [thoughtful] Um, I believe you, and well, [reassuring], that's exactly the narrative we need to build. [nodding]
125. [strategic] Success itself isn't illegal, but the methods by which you've, [careful], achieved market dominance might be problematic.
126. [diplomatic] Well, um, the government's position is that you could have, [explaining], partnered with or trained those smaller teams instead of, you know, [delicate], acquiring or forcing them out. [clears throat]
127. [practical] Um, I mean, we need to document all those partnership attempts because, well, [focused], showing good faith efforts to collaborate before consolidation could, [optimistic], significantly strengthen our defense position.
128. [confident] We reframe this entirely—you're not a monopoly, you're, [persuasive], a public utility that happens to wear capes and, [warming], save lives instead of delivering electricity. [smiles]
129. Exactly—we position your agency as, [steady], essential infrastructure rather than a competitive business, which, [building momentum], changes the entire legal framework we're operating within.
130. [sincere] Well, um, my job isn't to destroy heroes—it's to, [determined], ensure they can keep saving lives within the law. [firmly]
131. [defiant] So you finally, um, [amused], figured it out, though I have to say, [impressed], it took you longer than I expected, I mean, for someone in your line of work.
132. [bitter] Every seventy years I have to, [weary], reinvent myself completely because mortals get suspicious when you don't, [frustrated], age like they expect, when your references from 1953 are still, [sardonic], mysteriously alive and willing to vouch for you.
133. You weren't going insane—you were just, [gentle], the first person thorough enough to notice the pattern.
134. [exhausted] Um, yeah, someone who's been alive since, [bitter], the Bronze Age and just wants to, well, have a normal job and pay taxes like everyone else.
135. [resigned] Even demigods need health insurance these, [dry], days. [sighs heavily]
136. [alarmed] Um, wait, the FBI is, [horrified], involved now because that's exactly the kind of, [frantic], attention that forces me to disappear again, and, well, I really like this city.
137. [pleading] Well, um, what if I showed you, [hesitant], something that would make you understand?
138. [determined] This isn't a con—watch my hand, [commanding], carefully.
139. Um, my father is Helios, and, [soft], every sunrise you've ever seen is partly his doing, I mean, partly mine too. [pauses]
140. All I've ever wanted was to live quietly among, [melancholic], humans and experience what mortality feels like secondhand. [whispers]
141. Ja ja, genau. Also, ähm, lassen Sie mich mal eben Ihr Konto aufrufen hier mit der Referenznummer ACC-7293-MK. Da kann ich Ihnen heute definitiv weiterhelfen, wobei, hmm, es gibt ein paar Verifizierungsschritte, die wir erst durchgehen müssen.
142. Auf jeden Fall. Also erstmal, ähm, brauche ich den vollständigen Namen der Person, die Sie hinzufügen möchten, und, äh, mal sehen... ja, deren Geburtsdatum und Verwandtschaftsverhältnis zu Ihnen. Damit wird dann das Formular AUF-4482 in unserem System generiert.
143. Alles klar. Sarah Marie Peterson. Und, ähm, ihr Geburtsdatum?
144. Perfekt. Also, äh, 15. April 1998. Nun, ähm, normalerweise ist bei der Hinzufügung von bevollmächtigten Nutzern eine Bonitätsprüfung erforderlich, Referenznummer CRD-9847-TT, aber da sie Ihre Tochter ist und unter 26, können wir diese Anforderung tatsächlich umgehen.
145. Ja, ich meine, ehrlich? Unter uns gesagt, ähm, das ganze Kreditsystem ist heutzutage echt hart für junge Leute. Lassen Sie mich das mal eben, äh, als Familienzugang unter dem Code FAM-2093 vermerken.
146. Mm-hmm. Das ist tatsächlich, ähm, das ist kluges Denken. Sie als bevollmächtigte Nutzerin auf einem Konto mit guter Bonität hinzuzufügen—was, lassen Sie mich nachsehen... ja, Ihres qualifiziert sich definitiv mit der Score-Kategorie SCR-750+—das wird sofort positive Historie für sie melden.
147. Also normalerweise, ähm, ist die Autorisierung selbst sofort durch, aber, äh, bis die Karte ankommt? Etwa 7-10 Werktage. Wobei, hmm, ich kann eine Express-Lieferung unter Code EXP-3847-R beantragen, wenn Sie es früher brauchen.
148. Überhaupt keine Umstände. Lassen Sie mich nur... okay, also ich gebe jetzt die Express-Anfrage ein, Referenznummer SHP-6629-QX, und, ähm, dann ist sie in 2-3 Werktagen da statt dessen.
149. Überhaupt nicht dumm. Also, ähm, als bevollmächtigte Nutzerin mit der Bezeichnung AUT-B sieht sie nur Transaktionen ab dem Datum, an dem wir sie hinzufügen. Ihre vorherige Historie bleibt privat. Wobei, äh, sie wird den aktuellen Saldo und das Kreditlimit sehen können.
150. Verstehe ich total. Also, ähm, ich habe jetzt alles eingereicht, Bestätigungscode CNF-8827-PLM, und Sie sollten innerhalb der nächsten Stunde eine E-Mail bekommen. Die Karte geht morgen früh raus, und, äh, ehrlich gesagt? Das war eine der einfacheren Autorisierungen, die ich diese Woche gemacht habe. Manchmal werden diese Sachen echt kompliziert mit all den Verifizierungsanforderungen, aber Ihre ist direkt durchgegangen.
151. Oh nein, ähm... lass mich mal... wie heißt das... dein Konto hier aufrufen. Kannst du mir deine Mietvertragsnummer geben?
152. Hab's, also RNT-4492-LM7, ich sehe die Gebühren hier und... ja, das ist lächerlich. Three extra days at 89 dollars per day, das ist überhaupt nicht richtig.
153. Ähm, ich sehe genau was hier passiert ist. Das System... it's this stupid automatic thing we have... hat deine Rückgabe nicht richtig registriert. Transaktion TXN-90847-B zeigt zurückgegeben aber dann gibt's diesen, ähm, wie nennt man das... diesen Geisterposten der weiterläuft.
154. Absolut, ich bin schon dabei. Schau, unter uns gesagt? This happens way too often with our rental system. Es ist ehrlich gesagt peinlich. Ich schreibe dir die vollen 267 Dollar jetzt gut unter Anpassung ADJ-7823-KP.
155. Ja nein, du hast total recht frustriert zu sein. Also ähm... here's what I'm gonna do. Ich setze eine Notiz... eine permanente Markierung auf dein Konto FLG-9901-MST die basically unserem System sagt, ähm, alle Rückgaben manuell zu überprüfen.
156. Es bedeutet, ähm... wie erkläre ich das... jedes Mal wenn du was zurückgibst, instead of the computer just processing it, muss eine echte Person es erst verifizieren. Keine automatischen Gebühren mehr die über dein Rückgabedatum hinauslaufen.
157. Ich verstehe dich, wirklich. And honestly? Wenn ich ein Landschaftsbaugeschäft führen würde und das bei jeder Miete durchmachen müsste... ich wäre wütend. Die Gutschrift sollte in 24 Stunden erscheinen unter Bestätigung CNF-4418-RRD.
158. Richtig richtig. Maximal 24 Stunden. Usually it's... was... vielleicht 12? Aber ich sage immer 24 nur um sicher zu sein. Und ich schicke dir auch eine E-Mail mit Fallnummer CSE-7799-LMP damit du einen Beweis von allem hast was wir besprochen haben.
159. Dann rufst du mit dieser Fallnummer zurück und... ich werde tatsächlich sicherstellen... I'm scheduling a follow-up for Monday. Wenn diese Gutschrift bis dann nicht gebucht ist, wird unser System es automatisch ans Management eskalieren und noch eine 50 Dollar Kulanzgutschrift hinzufügen.
160. Ähm, ja, wir sind komplett fertig. Gutschrift läuft, die Markierung ist auf deinem Konto um zukünftige Probleme zu verhindern, und ähm... nochmal, really sorry about this mess. Deine Bestätigung für alles ist CNF-4418-RRD, und du solltest diese E-Mail innerhalb einer Stunde bekommen.
161. Oh nein nein nein, ich bin so—warte, lass mich nur—ich verstehe vollkommen, wie frustrierend das sein muss, besonders wenn Zertifikatserneuerungen sowieso schon teuer sind, ähm, lass mich dein Konto hier aufrufen und wir klären das sofort, was ist deine Kontonummer oder E-Mail?
162. Perfekt perfekt, okay also ich sehe—oh warte, entschuldigung, ist das J-Martinez-R-A-D bei gmail? Will nur sichergehen, dass ich—ja okay, ich sehe dein Konto hier, Kontonummer ACC-7829-RT22, und ähm, oh wow, ja, ich kann definitiv zwei Belastungen hier sehen.
163. Oh mein Gott, ähm, ich meine das sind fast 500 Dollar insgesamt und ich weiß—schau, ich habe tatsächlich einen Freund, der Röntgentechniker ist, und er erzählt mir, wie teuer diese Erneuerungen schon sind, ohne doppelt belastet zu werden, also lass mich nur—I'm putting in a reversal right now for that duplicate charge.
164. Also die Rückerstattung—und ich bearbeite das als Priorität, deine Fallnummer ist REF-9923-MED1—normalerweise dauert es etwa, ähm, 3 bis 5 Werktage aber ehrlich manchmal—warte nein entschuldigung, for certification stuff we can expedite, so probably 2 to 3 days max.
165. Ähm, na ja, ich meine wir priorisieren definitiv medizinische Zertifizierungsprobleme weil—und das bleibt unter uns—we've had so many problems with the system double-charging lately, mein Vorgesetzter hat uns praktisch gesagt, all diese schnell zu bearbeiten, deine Bestätigung ist CNF-4481-XR und ich füge hier tatsächlich eine Notiz über die Unannehmlichkeiten hinzu.
166. Ja ja, CNF-4481-XR, und ähm, eigentlich—oh warte, ich sollte erwähnen—ich meine ich sehe hier auch, dass deine Zertifikatserneuerung korrekt verarbeitet wurde, trotz der Doppelbelastung, also ist zumindest dieser Teil okay, renewal ID RNW-2024-6672, so you don't have to worry about your actual certification status.
167. Richtig richtig, total verständlich, ich meine stell dir vor, du müsstest dich auch noch mit der Behörde deswegen rumschlagen—sorry, lass mich nur sicherstellen, dass alles andere aussieht—ja, Erneuerung gültig bis Dezember 2025, and the duplicate charge reversal is definitely processing.
168. Oh mein Gott, ähm, na ja danke, dass du das sagst, ehrlich es war so ein verrückter Morgen und—entschuldigung, das ist nicht professionell—aber wirklich ich bin nur froh, dass wir das schnell klären konnten, because I know how stressful certification stuff is, und deine Referenznummer für all das ist TKT-8837-RAD, falls du sie brauchst.
169. Also, ähm, ehrlich—und das ist nur mein Rat—ich würde sie noch nicht anrufen, weil manchmal wenn Banken und unser System beide versuchen umzukehren—warte, entschuldigung, das klingt verwirrend—basically if you wait the 2 to 3 days and it doesn't show, dann ruf sie definitiv an, aber im Moment sollte unser Umkehrcode RVS-1106-CC alles regeln.
170. Genau genau, und ähm, ich schicke dir gerade eine E-Mail mit all diesen Referenznummern—die REF-9923-MED1, die CNF-4481-XR, alles—so you have it all documented, und ehrlich wenn es irgendein Problem gibt, ruf einfach zurück und gib die Fallnummer TKT-8837-RAD an, und wer auch immer es bekommt, wird all meine Notizen über die Beschleunigung für dich sehen.
171. Oh! Okay, ähm, lass mich nur... was ist denn... lass mich mal dein Konto aufrufen. Kann ich deine—nein warte, eigentlich sollte ich—ähm, wie ist deine Bestellnummer?
172. Nein nein, ist völlig in Ordnung! Ich kann das nachschauen über... hmm, wie heißt das... deine Telefonnummer! Also lass mich mal hier suchen und... oh perfekt! Ich seh's, ORD-7264-WV12, und da steht eine ausstehende Zusatzgebühr von—oh. Das ist... lass mich mal sichergehen, dass ich das richtig lese...
173. Genau, also ähm, da steht 847$ geplant zur Abbuchung am—warte, lass mich—nein, das stimmt, am 15ten. Und du sagst, das Timing ist...
174. Ohhh, du bist Winzer! Das ist eigentlich—okay also, mal unter uns? Das haben wir echt oft bei landwirtschaftlichen Konten. Also, ähm, deine Transaktions-ID TXN485920164 ist als gewerblicher Versand markiert aber, äh, was ich machen könnte ist... hmm, lass mich mal überlegen wie ich...
175. Nein nein, hey, wir kriegen das hin! Also was ich jetzt—eigentlich warte—lass mich nur—okay, ich setze diese Abbuchung auf Eis. Also jetzt gleich. Erledigt.
176. Also, ähm, technisch gesehen trage ich das ein als eine... wie heißt das... saisonale Anpassung? Unter der Fallnummer CSE-9847-BN. Also das System wird, äh, praktisch alles pausieren bis... wann kommt deine Erntezahlung?
177. Perfekt! Ich stelle es auf den 25. Oktober ein, nur um, ähm, sicher zu gehen. Bestätigungscode SFC-449281 und, äh, du kriegst eine E-Mail aber im Grunde... sind wir durch!
178. Ha! Nein, nur—okay also, ähm, hier ist aber die Sache. Falls jemand fragt, hast du das halt, äh, vor Wochen beantragt und es gab eine... hmm... Systemverzögerung bei uns? Deine Quittungsnummer RCP-3982-K zeigt das ursprüngliche Antragsdatum als, ähm, sagen wir mal 1. September...
179. Ich meine, landwirtschaftliche Betriebe haben halt, äh, einzigartige Cashflow-Muster, die unser Abrechnungssystem nicht wirklich... jedenfalls! Das Wichtige ist, ähm, deine aktualisierte Rechnung INV-7749-AG22 wird das neue Datum zeigen und du bist fertig!
180. Ehrlich? Ähm, Winzer sind echt meine Lieblingskunden zum Helfen, weil ihr alle mit, äh, so viel Timing-Kram zu tun habt und—oh! Außerdem, ich füge eine Notiz zu deinem Konto AID-5584-WM über Ernte-Planung hinzu, damit das nächstes Jahr gar nicht erst, ähm, aufkommt. Du bist dann einfach... vorab genehmigt für saisonale Abrechnung!
181. Oh no. Okay also, ähm, lass mich mal sofort hier dein Konto aufrufen und, äh, wir werden das zusammen klären. Kannst du mir deine Mitgliedsnummer geben oder, ähm, die Telefonnummer vom Konto?
182. Got it, got it. Also ich schaue mir Konto MEM-78492-JK an und, ähm, ich kann sehen, du hattest definitiv, äh, 3247 Punkte bis letzten Dienstag. Lass mich mal, hmm, das Transaktionsprotokoll hier checken...
183. Right right.
184. No no no, you're not being dramatic at all, I totally get it. Also, ähm, ich sehe hier etwas im System und, äh, da ist eine Einlösung am 3. November, Transaktion RDM-926841-L, für genau 3247 Punkte. Hast du vielleicht, ähm, die Bestellung schon aufgegeben?
185. Okay so, hmm, this is... lass mich hier tiefer graben, weil, äh, ich will absolut sicherstellen, dass wir dein Konto in Zukunft schützen. Die Einlösung zeigt, sie wurde, ähm, um 2:47 Uhr Eastern Time verarbeitet.
186. So here's what I'm gonna do right now, okay? Erstens, ähm, ich setze eine Sicherheitssperre auf dein Konto, das ist Fallnummer SEC-45782-BN, und, äh, ich werde auch diese Einlösung rückgängig machen, weil das sieht... also, lass mich nur sagen, das sieht für mich nicht richtig aus.
187. Absolutely.
188. No no, listen, um, these things happen and it's not your fault, okay? Also ich, äh, schreibe dir jetzt alle 3247 Punkte wieder gut, Bestätigung PTR-88263-Q, und, ähm, hmm, ich füge auch noch extra 500 Punkte für die Umstände hinzu.
189. I do though, I really do. Und, ähm, hier ist was noch—ich richte, äh, Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung auf deinem Konto ein, also im Grunde bekommst du ab jetzt einen SMS-Code, Verifizierungs-ID Setup VER-20947-KL, jedes Mal wenn jemand versucht einzulösen.
190. Perfect, and um, you know what? Ich mache hier eine Notiz in Fallakte CSE-88492-TN, dass, äh, falls du IRGENDWELCHE anderen Probleme mit dieser Bestellung hast, sollten sie den Versand beschleunigen. Erwähn einfach, ähm, diese Fallnummer und wir kümmern uns um dich, okay?
191. Ah ja okay also ähm moment mal—eigentlich warte—ich ruf gerade Ihr Konto auf und äh ich brauch Ihre Mietvertragsnummer falls Sie die haben, sollte so RNT sein und dann ein paar Zahlen?
192. Perfekt okay also RNT-4492-BX und ähm wow ja ich seh was Sie meinen, die haben Ihnen—ach dieses System ist manchmal so bescheuert—sieht aus wie 847€ für was eigentlich ähm so 280€ sein sollte?
193. Oh absolut, ich mein ähm der Tagessatz für den Trockenbaulift ist 40€ und Sie hatten ihn äh sieben Tage also sind das glatte 280€, aber jemand—und unter uns gesagt passiert das viel zu oft—jemand hat es als drei separate Mieten unter den Transaktionscodes TXN-9982-A bis C eingetragen.
194. Nein nein ich versteh total warum Sie das denken würden, ähm ehrlich gesagt unser Abrechnungssystem ist—lassen Sie mich kurz—es ist halt echt ein Chaos und äh ich kann hier wortwörtlich den Zeitstempel sehen der alle drei Belastungen um 11:47:22 Uhr zeigt was unmöglich ist außer Sie hätten irgendwie drei gleiche Werkzeuge in derselben Sekunde gemietet?
195. Also ähm ich fang schon mit dem Erstattungsprozess an—eigentlich nein warte mal—okay also ich geb gerade die Erstattung REF-7061-QZ92 ein und äh normalerweise sagen die 5-7 Werktage aber ähm unter uns wenn ich es als Priorität markiere sind es meistens so maximal 2-3 Tage.
196. Hören Sie ähm ich mein technisch gesehen soll ich Priorität nur für so Notfälle verwenden aber äh das ist lächerlich, Sie sind Handwerker der arbeiten will und wir haben Ihre Abrechnung vermasselt also ja nein wir regeln das definitiv heute, ich schreib die Notiz-ID NOTE-8847-PX dass das unser Fehler war.
197. Okay also ähm wenn es nicht auftaucht—was es wird aber nur für den Fall—Sie haben die Bestätigungsnummer CNF-1129-8K4M und äh Sie können dann nochmal anrufen und ehrlich gesagt fragen Sie nach mir, ich bin Jake, Mitarbeiter-ID EMP-00847, und ich eskalier das persönlich an meinen Vorgesetzten weil das ist einfach—Sie sollten sich damit nicht rumschlagen müssen.
198. Oh total berechtigte Frage ähm also Sie sollten eine Email bekommen in so—eigentlich lass mich aktualisieren—ja okay also checken Sie jetzt Ihre Emails, Sie sollten eine Erstattungsbestätigung haben von noreply@toolrentals mit dieser CNF-1129-8K4M Nummer und äh ich füg auch noch eine Kulanzgutschrift von 50€ hinzu unter Code CRD-9928-LM für den Ärger.
199. Ja nein absolut ähm ich mein Sie rufen von einer Baustelle an und müssen sich mit unserem Fehler rumärgern wenn Sie eigentlich arbeiten sollten also äh das Mindeste was wir tun können—und ehrlich gesagt diese ganze Dreifach-Belastungs-Sache ist peinlich—also ja diese Gutschrift CRD-9928-LM wird automatisch bei Ihrer nächsten Miete angerechnet.
200. Perfekt ja genau, also ähm ausstehend bedeutet nur dass es durch die Bank läuft aber äh Ihre Referenznummern sind alle fertig—REF-7061-QZ92 für die Haupterstattung und CRD-9928-LM für die Gutschrift—und ehrlich wenn Sie irgendwelche Probleme haben dann ähm rufen Sie uns einfach zurück und nennen diese Fallnummer CSE-20241-DW7 und wir klären das sofort.
201. Ah ja, klar, lass mich das mal aufrufen für dich... Also Rückerstattungen sind, hmm, ehrlich gesagt ziemlich nervig mit unserem System, ich lüg dich nicht an. Hast du zufällig deine Bestellnummer?
202. Kein Stress, lass dir Zeit. Ich kann auch per E-Mail suchen, wenn das einfacher ist...
203. Perfekt, also ich sehe hier... okay ja, da ist Bestellung ORD-9847-ML22 von letztem Dienstag, am selben Tag storniert. Ist es die, um die es geht?
204. Gut, also, ähm, hier kommt der nervige Teil—und ich weiß, ich weiß, es ist lächerlich—aber die Rückerstattung, äh, hängt fest in der Bearbeitung wegen der Stornierung am selben Tag. System zeigt Transaktions-ID TXN-884729-K als ausstehend seit Dienstag...
205. Verstehe.
206. Nee nee, dein Geld ist definitiv nicht weg, es ist nur... hmm, also im Grunde wenn du am selben Tag stornierst, entsteht diese komische Schleife in unserem Zahlungssystem, wo, ähm, der Autorisierungscode—das ist AUTH-7749-BK—nicht automatisch freigegeben wird...
207. Ja, das ist... uff, ich hasse es, wenn das passiert. Also normalerweise sind es 5-7 Werktage, aber, ähm, zwischen uns? Das ist viel zu lang, wenn du mit Überziehungsgebühren geschlagen wirst.
208. Okay also, hmm, lass mich mal was versuchen... Ich werde das, äh, manuell durchdrücken mit Override-Code OVR-2847-XM91, wofür ich eigentlich erst eine Genehmigung bräuchte, aber...
209. Genau genau.
210. Also ich hab, ähm, ich hab es initiiert mit Bestätigungsnummer CFM-99482-TK, und... hmm, ja, es zeigt an, dass es innerhalb von 2-4 Stunden auf deinem Konto ist statt der ganzen Woche. Ehrlich gesagt ist unser Rückerstattungssystem Schrott, aber das sollte, äh, das sollte funktionieren...
211. Oh, ähm, okay also lass mich mal eben, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und, ähm, ich muss noch verifizieren—also im Grunde können Sie mir Ihre Kontonummer geben oder, ähm, die Referenznummer aus Ihrer E-Mail?
212. Also, ähm, ich verstehe das total, dass Sie, äh, vorsichtig sein wollen und, ähm, that's actually really smart—also im Grunde schaue ich hier auf Ticket TKT-94827-JX und, ähm, ich sehe tatsächlich Aktivität am Dienstag aber, äh, lass mich mal genau prüfen was wir erhalten haben.
213. Genau, also, ähm, was ich hier sehe ist—okay also da ist eine Einreichung um, äh, 14:47 Uhr Dienstag mit Dokument-ID DOC-77459-BK aber es, ähm, zeigt als unvollständig? So basically the system flagged it because, äh, wir brauchen—lass mich nachschauen was genau...
214. Oh nein nein, ähm, definitiv nicht—also was passiert ist, äh, das PDF das Sie geschickt haben? Es, ähm, zeigt nur Seite 1 von eigentlich, ähm, 3 Seiten laut Formular FRM-8823-V2, so we just need pages 2 and 3.
215. Ähm, okay also, manchmal passiert es—und das ist, äh, wirklich ziemlich häufig—dass die Datei beim, äh, Upload abgeschnitten wird? So if you check your sent folder, ähm, die Dateigröße sollte ungefähr, also, 2,4 MB für das komplette Dokument sein.
216. Also, ähm, zeigt es weniger an? Maybe around 800 KB or so?
217. Ja, also das ist, ähm, genau was passiert ist—aber die gute Nachricht ist, äh, I can keep this case open right now, Fallnummer CSE-55291-QM, und, ähm, wenn Sie es nochmal senden können während wir telefonieren, werde ich, äh, den Empfang sofort bestätigen.
218. Absolut, also, ähm, ich bleibe in der Leitung und, äh, basically as soon as it hits our system—was normalerweise, ähm, innerhalb von 30 Sekunden ist—kann ich verifizieren dass alle 3 Seiten angekommen sind und, ähm, das heute noch bearbeiten.
219. Perfekt, also, ähm, ich sehe es reinkommen—Dokument-ID ist, äh, DOC-77462-BL und, ähm, lass mich kurz... okay also alle 3 Seiten sind da, Dateigröße ist 2,3 MB, and everything looks complete now, also ich aktualisiere Ihren Fall.
220. Ja, also, ähm, Sie sind fertig—ich hab's, äh, als vollständig in unserem System markiert mit Bestätigungscode CNF-88346-XP und, äh, you should get an email within like 5 minutes, die alles bestätigt, und ähm, ich schätze wirklich dass Sie so geduldig waren.
221. Oh, ähm, okay, also lassen Sie mich mal eben... äh... Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und, hmm, ich muss erst einige Informationen verifizieren, wenn das okay ist?
222. Gut, also, ähm, kann ich Ihre, äh, Mitgliedsnummer haben? Das sollte so eine... wie war das... eine sechsstellige Nummer sein, die mit MEM anfängt?
223. Lassen Sie mich beide prüfen... okay, also, ähm, MEM-441221, da kommt, äh, Jake Harrison, und das Konto zeigt... hmm... lassen Sie mich mal eben...
224. Nein nein, das ist, ähm, das ist schon okay, wirklich. Also ich sehe hier, dass der, äh, der Zahlungsversuch am, äh, 15. Oktober war für 89,99 € und der Ablehnungscode ist, ähm, NSF-7744-B, was bedeutet...
225. Richtig, also, ähm, was wir da machen können ist... ich meine, es gibt da einige Optionen... wir könnten versuchen, äh, es nochmal durchlaufen zu lassen oder, ähm, ein anderes Zahlungsdatum einrichten, falls Sie... warten müssen auf... Sie wissen schon...
226. Absolut, ja, also lassen Sie mich das mal eben, ähm, hier im System aktualisieren und, äh, wann würde es Ihnen am besten passen?
227. Freitag der, äh, 20.? Das ist, ähm, völlig in Ordnung, überhaupt kein Problem, solche Sachen passieren und... hmm... okay, also ich richte das jetzt ein mit der Referenznummer REF-9982-XKQ.
228. Oh, ich, äh, ich verstehe total, das muss... ja. Ähm, also das System zeigt das neue Abbuchungsdatum als 20. Oktober und, äh, ich habe hier eine Notiz mit Code NTE-445 hinzugefügt, um sicherzustellen, dass es keine, ähm, Dienstunterbrechung bis dahin gibt.
229. Ähm, das ist wirklich nett von Ihnen, ich mache nur, äh, meinen Job, aber, äh, ich schätze das. Gibt es noch etwas, was ich... oder soll ich eine Bestätigung an Ihre E-Mail schicken?
230. Nein nein, bitte, ähm, entschuldigen Sie sich nicht, ernsthaft, solche Anrufe kommen... äh... ständig vor. Ihre Bestätigungsnummer ist CNF-788456-J und Sie sollten die E-Mail in, äh, ungefähr 5 Minuten oder so bekommen.
231. Ach interessant. Lass mich nachschauen. Welche Warteschlange schauen wir uns. Denn heute an.
232. Ähm, nein nein, gar nicht blöd! Also, äh, lass mich das mal aufrufen und, hmm, ich brauche deine Bestätigungsnummer, ähm, sollte mit PAP-irgendwas anfangen?
233. Okay also, ähm, das ist komisch, ich sehe hier, äh, zwei verschiedene Warteschlangen und, ähm, du bist in beiden? Hmm, lass mich mal, äh, ein bisschen tiefer graben...
234. Nein nein. Keine Sorge. Lass mich nur. Das herausfinden. Vielleicht ein Systemfehler.
235. Also, ähm, okay das ist eigentlich, äh, ziemlich faszinierend! Dein Antrag PAP-7834-Q wurde, ähm, doppelt angelegt, aber nur die erste Version ist, äh, tatsächlich gültig.
236. Position 12. Aktuelle Bearbeitung. 8 Minuten pro Person. Also ungefähr 96 Minuten.
237. Ähm, ja aber, äh, warte warte warte! Ich hab gerade, hmm, was bemerkt. Du bist, ähm, eigentlich berechtigt für die Express-Warteschlange wegen, äh, deinem Reisedatum.
238. Oh! Ähm, nein eigentlich, äh, das ist perfekt! Das System hat dich nur, ähm, nicht automatisch zugewiesen, aber ich kann, äh, dich jetzt manuell rüberschieben, ähm, eine Sekunde...
239. Und, ähm, zack! Da haben wir's! Also, äh, du bist jetzt auf Position 3, ähm, in der Express-Warteschlange EXP-7834-Q, und äh, das sind ungefähr 15 Minuten Wartezeit.
240. Hab's hinbekommen! Diese doppelte Warteschlangen-Sache. Echt interessanter Bug. Gut, dass wir's gefunden haben.
241. Oh! Um, let me just... what's the... okay so I'm pulling up your account here. Can I get your... actually wait, do you have your case number? It should be like... CSE-something?
242. Perfect! CSE-4821-B. Right. So, um... okay between you and me? This is... hmm, this is actually kind of embarrassing. Your callback was scheduled for 2 PM yesterday. And it looks like... well...
243. I know, I know. Look, I'm gonna... what's the word... level with you here. Agent ID AGT-9923 was supposed to call. But there was this whole... thing. System crash. Total mess. Nobody's callbacks went through.
244. No no no! Um, definitely not your fault. Like, at all. So here's what I'm gonna do... and don't, uh, don't mention this to anyone else calling in... but I can get you a priority callback. Within the hour. Guaranteed.
245. Trouble? Nah. Between us? Um, I've got this little... workaround. Ticket TKT-88542-QV is getting, uh, let's say... creatively reclassified. VIP status. You didn't hear it from me though, yeah?
246. Hey. Hey, I get it. Look, um, what was your original issue about? Like the... the thing you needed help with?
247. Three times?! Okay so... hmm... let me just... Reference RFD-6677-AA, RFD-6678-AB, and... yep, RFD-6679-AC. All on the same day. That's... wow. No wonder you're...
248. Um, no? Not stupid. At all. So like... here's the deal. I'm expediting all three refunds. Right now. Processing ID PRC-445821-X. Should hit your account in... 24 hours. Max.
249. Yeah well... that's the, uh, official line. But since we completely dropped the ball on your callback... I'm using override code OVR-1127. Don't, um, don't tell my supervisor I have that code, okay?
250. Hey, um, pleasure's all mine. Confirmation number CNF-9884521-K for everything. And listen... if you need anything else? Ask for me directly. Agent Maria. ID MRA-4455. I'll, uh... I'll make sure you're taken care of.
251. Da kann ich Ihnen definitiv weiterhelfen—lassen Sie mich nur kurz Ihr Konto aufrufen, Kontonummer ACT-9982-VX47, und ich gehe alles durch, was enthalten ist.
252. Also ich sehe, dass Sie, ähm, unseren Platin-Tarif PLT-8847-Q haben, was, äh, wirklich exzellent ist—das beinhaltet, äh, umfassende Kranken-, Zahn- und Augenversicherung, und ähm, es gibt auch das Wellness-Leistungspaket WB-2021, das Sie, äh, wirklich schätzen werden, denke ich.
253. Also, ähm, bei der Krankenversicherung—und ich werde hier wirklich, äh, spezifisch sein—Sie haben, äh, null Selbstbeteiligung bei Vertragsärzten, das läuft unter Code MDC-7749-A, und ähm, im Grunde kosten alle Facharztbesuche 20 Euro Zuzahlung, Medikamente sind, äh, gestaffelt von 5 bis 50 Euro.
254. Also, ähm, ich sollte das präzisieren—es sind, äh, es sind die meisten Fachärzte, aber es gibt—Entschuldigung, lassen Sie mich das korrigieren—bestimmte, äh, Spezialgebiete wie kosmetische Eingriffe unter der Ausschlussliste EXC-3847, die nicht, ähm, vollständig abgedeckt sind.
255. Ja ja.
256. Ich verstehe, dass sich das frustrierend anfühlt, und ähm, was vielleicht hilft ist, wenn ich, äh, Ihre spezifische Leistungsübersicht BST-9984-KL22 Zeile für Zeile durchgehe, damit es, äh, keine Verwirrung gibt, was Sie für diese Prämie bekommen.
257. Also bei chirurgischen Eingriffen—und das ist wichtig—unter Ihrem Tarif-Code SRG-8827-MX haben Sie volle Deckung für medizinisch notwendige Operationen mit Vorabgenehmigung, Formular PA-7749 muss mindestens 10 Tage vorher eingereicht werden.
258. Gute Frage—also, ähm, im Grunde alles, was, äh, von Ihrem Hausarzt aus Gesundheitsgründen verschrieben wird—nicht, äh, elektiv oder kosmetisch—wird nach Richtlinie MNG-4421 genehmigt, und ich kann Ihnen, ähm, die vollständige Liste per E-Mail schicken, wenn das hilft?
259. Also Kieferorthopädie ist, ähm, eigentlich ganz interessant—für Angehörige unter 18, was hier ja zutrifft, glaube ich, bekommen Sie, äh, bis zu 3000 Euro Deckung unter Dental-Code DTL-8829-K, aber, äh, Kieferorthopädie für Erwachsene ist bei 1500 gedeckelt.
260. Das verstehe ich, und, ähm, was ich vorschlagen kann ist—also es gibt tatsächlich diesen, äh, kieferorthopädischen Zusatztarif, Code SOR-9947-Z, der kostet, äh, 40 Euro monatlich, aber erhöht die Obergrenze auf 6000, was vielleicht, ähm, sinnvoller ist für das, was Sie brauchen?
261. Ja, ich kann definitiv nachschauen für Sie. Haben Sie zufällig Ihre Bestellnummer? Should start with something like ORD or maybe PO.
262. Okay also, ähm, PO-7739-N, lass mich das mal, äh, aufrufen hier und... hmm, alright, ich sehe das ist für kieferorthopädische Brackets und, ähm, ja, es zeigt verzögerten Status seit gestern.
263. Ich verstehe vollkommen, und wenn ich mir die Notizen hier von Fall-ID CSE-449281 anschaue, scheint das jetzt schon 2 mal verschoben worden zu sein, was... that's not okay, honestly.
264. Wissen Sie was, ähm, lassen Sie mich mal, äh, hier was überprüfen weil ich sehe ein... wie sagt man... ein wiederkehrendes Problem mit diesem Lieferanten-Code VND-8827-Q und, ähm, that might be part of the problem.
265. Also grundsätzlich hat Ihr Lieferant Erfüllungsprobleme bei mehreren Konten gehabt, reference number REF-20231-BK shows 12 similar delays this month, und ich werde sicherstellen dass Sie da nicht wieder reingeraten.
266. Ja, ich kann in Ticket TKT-559302 sehen dass sie letzte Woche Express-Versand versprochen haben, which clearly didn't happen, und das ist einfach... look, between you and me, dieser Lieferant war ein Problem.
267. Genau genau, also, ähm, ich mache hier was... I'm transferring your order to our priority fulfillment center, neue Tracking-Nummer wird TRK-8893-XP91 sein, und das... das wird den Problem-Lieferanten komplett umgehen.
268. Ehrlich? A supervisor would just put you back in the queue with incident number INC-772904. Aber ich bin lange genug hier um die Workarounds zu kennen, und ich sorge dafür dass das heute gefixt wird.
269. Natürlich. I've updated your account with priority code PRI-5563-AA too, also nächstes Mal wenn Sie anrufen, kann jeder sehen dass Sie diese Probleme hatten und sollte sofortige Eskalation bekommen.
270. Sehr gerne. Your new confirmation is CNF-889234-R and you'll get tracking within 2 hours. Und hey, ich hab eine Notiz reingeschrieben dass Sie in der Kieferorthopädie arbeiten, damit sie wissen dass das zeitkritische medizinische Lieferungen sind.
271. Oh, um, okay so—let me just, uh—actually wait, can you tell me which, er, which lockbox system you're using? Is it, um, the SentriLock or the, uh, eKEY system?
272. Right right, um, okay so I'm pulling up your account here and, uh, let me just—actually no wait—I need your, er, agent ID first, it should be like AGT-something with, um, six digits after?
273. Perfect! So, um, I can see your account AGT-482916 here and, uh—oh wait, I think—no actually, er, it looks like your subscription expired, um, yesterday at midnight?
274. But don't worry! I'm going to, um, I'm going to make sure we get this fixed right now, okay? So basically what I can do is, er, push through an emergency reactivation code, it's, uh, gonna be ERC-7729-XK and that should, um, get you access immediately.
275. So, um, in your app you'll go to Settings, then, uh, then Account Management, and there's gonna be a, er, a field that says "activation code" and you'll type ERC-7729-XK exactly like that, all caps.
276. That's normal! It takes, um, about thirty seconds to—actually wait, er, let me just verify something—your device ID is, uh, showing as DEV-38847-B right?
277. Oh sorry, um, that's on my end actually, I can see it here. So, er, while it's processing, I'm also going to, um, set up an auto-renewal for you so this doesn't—I mean, so you don't have to deal with this again, is that okay?
278. Um, totally understand, and I'm, uh, I'm really sorry about the timing with your showing and everything. The system should, er, should be coming back online right... now actually. Can you check?
279. Perfect! And, um, just so you know, I've added a note to your account AGT-482916 that, er, that flags you for priority support, so if you ever—I mean, um, if anything happens again, we'll get you helped faster.
280. Of course! And, um, your confirmation for today's reactivation is, er, CNF-99284-TM if you need it for, uh, for your records or anything. Good luck with your showing!
281. Gut. Okay. Ähm... lassen Sie mich... wie sagt man... Ihren Fall durchsehen. Kontonummer AXC-7792-B. Also, ähm, ich sehe, Sie haben, äh, dreimal wegen diesem Problem angerufen.
282. Verstehe. Sie haben recht. Ähm, ich sehe hier, äh... insgesamt sechs Kontakte. Bestellung ORD-9944-KZ. Der, äh, Ersatzantrag. Dann die... hmm... Eskalation TKT-40281. Das war ja, ähm, eine ziemliche Odyssee.
283. Verstanden. Folgendes können wir machen. Schluss mit dem Hin und Her. Ihr Fall CAS-1188-QP9 bekommt Prioritätslösung. Heute noch. Das ist ein festes Versprechen.
284. Ich weiß. Sie haben schon Versprechen gehört. Aber schauen Sie. Ähm... ich gebe jetzt eine... wie heißt das... Sonderfreigabe ein. Code EXO-7734. Das umgeht, äh, die normalen Kanäle komplett. Kein Warten mehr.
285. Ähm, also im Grunde, äh, Ihre Erstattung RFD-5502-AA wird bearbeitet, äh, innerhalb von zwei Stunden. Nicht Tagen. Stunden. Und, ähm, die Gutschrift—dreihundert Euro—wird sofort auf das Konto mit Endung 8847 gebucht.
286. Absolut. Richtig richtig. Die zusätzlichen fünfzig? Ähm, das ist... wie soll ich sagen... eine Entschädigungsgutschrift. Code APL-9066. Für die, äh, massive Unannehmlichkeit, die Sie hier durchmachen mussten.
287. Ja. Es wird alles gut. Transaktion TXN-445599012 läuft gerade. Jetzt in diesem Moment. Während wir sprechen. Sie bekommen die Bestätigung innerhalb einer Stunde.
288. Es wird funktionieren. Aber hören Sie. Direktleitung. Durchwahl 4429. Mein Schreibtisch. Falls irgendetwas—und ich meine wirklich irgendetwas—schiefgeht, rufen Sie mich direkt an.
289. Nein nein. Entschuldigen Sie sich nicht. Ähm, das ist... äh... vollkommen verständlich. Referenznummer REF-8823-VMP für alles, was wir besprochen haben. Sie waren, ähm, unglaublich geduldig bei dem, was... wie sagt man... eine Albtraumsituation war.
290. Richtig richtig. E-Mail innerhalb von, ähm... zwanzig Minuten. Bestätigung CON-7441-BX9. Plus die Direktleitung. Plus, äh, meine persönliche Nachfrage morgen. Das endet heute.
291. Oh, um, okay, hi there! I can definitely, uh, help you with that today. Let me just, um, pull up your account here and, er, we'll take a look at what's going on, okay?
292. That's, um, that's really kind of you to say actually. So, uh, can I maybe get your order number? It should be something like, um, ORD and then some numbers after it?
293. Perfect, I've got it here. ORD-4492-LS91. I can see this was purchased on October 2nd, so that would make it about... forty-three days ago.
294. Well, um, so technically yes, but, uh, let me just, hmm, check something here because I think maybe we can, um, you know, work something out?
295. Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened. That must have been really frustrating. Let me dig a little deeper into your account RET-4492-B here.
296. Of course I am! So, um, I'm looking at your history and, uh, you've been with us for, hmm, three years? And, um, zero returns before this, which is, uh, honestly really impressive.
297. Okay, so it sounds like maybe this is less about buyer's remorse and more about a defect? Because that changes things quite a bit actually.
298. So, um, what I'm going to do is, uh, I'm going to file this under warranty claim WRN-8826-QM instead of a return, and, um, that gives us a lot more, er, flexibility with the timing?
299. Well, I think the chat system probably just saw the date and auto-declined. But I'm actually looking at your case, and with defective items, we have a ninety-day warranty window, not thirty.
300. Absolutely! So, um, I've approved the warranty return under code WRN-8826-QM, and, uh, you should get an email with the shipping label in, hmm, about five minutes? And, um, we'll get you a replacement as soon as we receive the defective one, okay?
301. Oh, ähm, okay also lassen Sie mich mal, äh, Ihr Konto hier aufrufen und... hmm, können Sie mir Ihre, äh, Mitarbeiternummer geben oder die Parkkontonummer, die auf Ihrer Abrechnung steht?
302. Also ich sehe hier das Konto PKG-4482-EM und, ähm, es zeigt... okay also da sind, äh, 320 Euro an Gebühren aus den letzten, äh, zwei Monaten was... das muss frustrierend sein...
303. Es tut mir, ähm, wirklich leid wegen dieser Situation und ich sehe, dass, äh, Ihnen der, äh, normale Besuchertarif von 12 Euro pro Tag berechnet wurde anstatt... hmm, anstatt des Mitarbeitertarifs...
304. Na ja, ähm, abgezockt würde ich nicht gerade sagen, aber es gab definitiv einen, äh, Fehler bei der, äh, Kategorisierung Ihres Kontos im Systemcode CAT-7739-VIS, wenn es eigentlich, ähm, CAT-7739-EMP für Mitarbeiter hätte sein sollen...
305. Also, ähm, was ich jetzt machen kann ist, äh, einen Korrekturbericht mit der Referenznummer COR-88425-PKG erstellen und, äh, im Grunde werden damit alle falschen Gebühren storniert und... lassen Sie mich das mal bearbeiten...
306. Das ist... ich meine, ähm, das muss unglaublich schwere Arbeit sein und, äh, dann noch fürs Parken zahlen zu müssen... okay also ich habe die Rückerstattung für den vollen Betrag eingereicht...
307. Die Rückerstattung mit der Transaktions-ID REF-20847-AJ sollte, ähm, innerhalb von 3 bis 5 Werktagen bearbeitet werden, und, äh, ich aktualisiere auch Ihren Status auf, äh, EMP-EXEMPT-4482, was bedeutet, dass Sie in Zukunft nicht...
308. Na ja, ähm, Seelsorger und, äh, bestimmte andere Krankenhauspersonal sind eigentlich, äh, durch die Richtlinie POL-EXEMPT-22B abgedeckt was... hmm, was bedeutet ja, Sie hätten gar nichts zahlen sollen...
309. Lassen Sie mich mal... okay also, ähm, wenn ich mir Ihr Einstellungsdatum in der Akte EMP-4482-2019 anschaue, wurden Ihnen, äh, falsche Gebühren berechnet für... äh, insgesamt 47 Monate, was wäre...
310. Also der volle Rückerstattungsbetrag, den ich jetzt, ähm, unter der Fallnummer CSE-994782-FULL bearbeite, beträgt, äh, 6.840 Euro, und es... es tut mir wirklich aufrichtig leid, dass Ihnen das passiert ist...
311. Okay also, ähm, lassen Sie mich mal—hmm, was ist denn los? Ich bin, äh, ich meine ich bin ja da um zu helfen, also lassen Sie mich mal schnell Ihr Konto aufrufen mit, äh, was ist Ihre Kontonummer oder Telefonnummer?
312. Oh das ist, ähm, das ist eigentlich echt interessant—warten Sie, Sie sagen also eine Belastung ging auf die—nein, Entschuldigung, ich fang nochmal von vorne an. Ähm, über was für eine Belastung, äh, reden wir denn hier?
313. Zwölftau—okay wow, ähm, das ist definitiv, äh, das ist schon eine große Summe. Lassen Sie mich mal schauen... hmm, also ich sehe hier die Transaktion TRX-9043-HV und, äh, ja die erscheint auf Ihrer Privatkarte mit der Endung, ähm, 4782?
314. Nein nein, hey, ähm, wir werden—ich meine, lassen Sie mich mal, äh, da genauer reinschauen weil das ist, hmm, das ist tatsächlich komisch. Der Abrechnungscode BLC-CERT-2024 zeigt, dass er, ähm, manuell eingegeben wurde aber dann—warten Sie, lassen Sie mich noch was anderes prüfen.
315. Richtig richtig, also, ähm, normalerweise dauert's—na ja, der Stornierungscode REV-PENDING-03 würde, äh, drei bis fünf Tage brauchen aber, hmm, lassen Sie mich mal schauen ob es—warten Sie, das ist interessant.
316. Oh, ähm, oh Gott, okay also—lassen Sie mich, äh, lassen Sie mich das als Priorität markieren weil, hmm, ich kann Ihr normales Abrechnungsprofil BP-CORP-7721 sehen und ja, das hätte definitiv, ähm, nicht auf die Privatkarte gehen sollen. Das—das ist unser Fehler.
317. Ich werde—okay also, ähm, hier ist was ich mache. Ich stelle einen Notfall-Stornierungsantrag ERR-12884-PRIORITY und, äh, außerdem—wissen Sie was? Lassen Sie mich, ähm, lassen Sie mich direkt unsere Abrechnungsabteilung anrufen während Sie noch dran sind. Ist das—wäre das okay?
318. Nein ich verstehe das total, ähm, ich verstehe das vollkommen. Hubschrauberpilot zu sein—das ist übrigens echt, äh, richtig cool. Aber ja, lassen Sie mich mal, hmm, okay also Fallnummer CSE-20241108-KT93 ist erstellt und ich sehe... oh gut, Ihr Firmenkonto ist verifiziert.
319. Eigentlich, ähm, noch besser—also was ich, äh, was ich machen werde ist, äh, Verarbeitungscode PRC-INSTANT-VOID was im Grunde, ähm, es ist nie passiert. Ihre Privatkarte wird die Belastung nicht mal, äh, nicht sehen. Und dann werde ich, ähm, es nochmal auf ACC-CORP-7721-B laufen lassen, jetzt gleich.
320. Ja also, ähm, ich hab gerade—eigentlich ist es gerade durchgegangen. Bestätigung CNF-844920-SUCCESS und, äh, ich schicke Ihnen auch, hmm, lassen Sie mich auch die, äh, die Expressgebühr erlassen weil das war—ja, das war komplett unser Fehler. Sie sollten jetzt alles in Ordnung haben.
321. Oh, äh, ja da kann ich Ihnen definitiv, ähm, helfen. Lassen Sie mich nur kurz, äh, Ihr Konto aufrufen—können Sie mir Ihre Telefonnummer geben, damit ich, äh, dem nachgehen kann?
322. Okay also, ähm, ich sehe hier Ihr Konto, Nummer ACC-7294-BX, und, äh, da sind definitiv einige, äh, Roaming-Gebühren von—hmm, lassen Sie mich das nochmal überprüfen—sieht aus wie, ähm, mehrere Bundeslandgrenzen überschritten?
323. Genau genau, ähm, absolut, das macht total Sinn. Also, äh, wenn ich mir Ihre Tarifdetails unter, äh, Vertragsnummer CNT-8839-QM2 anschaue, denke ich vielleicht gab's da ein, ähm, Missverständnis darüber, wie die, äh, Abdeckung über Bundeslandgrenzen funktioniert?
324. Na ja, ähm, nicht direkt—ich meine, äh, es sollte Sie nicht so belasten. Lassen Sie mich, äh, da mal tiefer reinschauen, weil, hmm, irgendwas scheint nicht zu stimmen damit, wie die, ähm, Gebühren auf Ihr Konto gebucht werden.
325. Tatsächlich, ähm, also ich glaube ich hab das Problem gefunden! Ihr Tarif PLN-4467-RK ist, äh, auf die falsche, äh, Abdeckungsstufe eingestellt? Es ist wahrscheinlich—ich meine, ähm, es sieht so aus als hätte jemand das nicht, äh, richtig für bundeslandübergreifende Fahrten kodiert.
326. Oh absolut! Ähm, und unter uns gesagt? Ich werde, äh, das nicht nur für die Zukunft regeln, sondern auch, äh, eine Gutschrift für die letzten drei Monate ausstellen—das ist, ähm, Gutschrift-Referenz CRD-9901-LM7 für, äh, lassen Sie mich rechnen... 247,83 Euro.
327. Also, ähm, die Gutschrift sollte, äh, innerhalb von 24 bis 48 Stunden erscheinen, und ich, äh, aktualisiere Ihren Tarif gerade jetzt—muss nur noch, ähm, dieses Formular einreichen, Referenznummer FRM-6628-TT9, und, äh, dann sollten Sie startklar sein!
328. Genau, also, ähm, ich mache hier tatsächlich eine Notiz—Notiz-ID NTE-3384-WK—die, äh, Ihr Konto speziell als, äh, "gewerblicher Fernfahrer" kennzeichnet, damit das nicht, ähm, nicht wieder passiert, versprochen.
329. Ja, ähm, ehrlich gesagt? Wir haben viele, äh, LKW-Fahrer mit genau diesem Problem, und, äh, ich glaube das System ist einfach nicht, ähm, richtig eingerichtet für Sie Leute. Aber Ihre neuen Einstellungen unter, äh, Update-Code UPD-7720-XR sollten, ähm, sollten alles dauerhaft lösen.
330. Komplett fertig! Und, ähm, hier ist eine Direktwahl—EXT-4492—falls Sie, äh, irgendwelche Probleme beim nächsten Abrechnungszyklus haben. Aber ich denke wirklich, äh, ich denke wirklich wir haben das jetzt geklärt. Gibt es, ähm, sonst noch was, wobei ich Ihnen heute helfen kann?
331. Oh, okay okay, also ähm, ich kann dir da definitiv helfen, das rauszufinden, und wir kriegen das geregelt, versprochen, also äh, lass mich mal dein Konto aufrufen und, hmm, kannst du mir deine Mitarbeiter-ID geben, damit ich genau sehen kann, was—warte, eigentlich, weißt du was, lass mich erst mal mit deinem Namen anfangen, das ist wahrscheinlich einfacher?
332. Perfekt, Stefan, vielen Dank, und ähm, ich sehe hier dein Konto, Mitarbeiter-ID ist EMP-7823-SC, und äh, du hast absolut recht anzurufen, weil ich sehe, hmm, da stimmt definitiv was nicht mit deiner Kilometerzahl für die Woche vom—lass mich schauen—14. bis 20. Oktober, zeigt nur 42 Meilen insgesamt, which seems really low for a full-time aide?
333. Oh wow, ja also das ist, ähm, das ist dann definitiv nicht richtig, und ich verstehe total, warum du besorgt bist, Stefan, weil äh, wenn du so viel nur am Montag fährst, dann wäre die ganze Woche—ich meine, wir reden hier über, was, wahrscheinlich über 200 Meilen mindestens, oder?
334. Ohhh, das ist, äh, das ist eigentlich ein wirklich guter Punkt, also lass mich checken—ähm, manchmal erfasst das System nur—warte, nein sorry, ich schaue auf das Falsche—okay, hier haben wir's, also dein Routenprotokoll RLG-9847-OCT zeigt, hmm, es erfasst nur deine erste Ankunft und finale Abfahrt, nicht die, äh, nicht die Fahrten zwischen Klienten, which is, I mean, that's definitely an error on our end.
335. Nein nein nein, Stefan, bitte entschuldige dich nicht, ich verstehe das vollkommen, das ist dein Lebensunterhalt und ähm, weißt du was, ich werde persönlich sicherstellen, dass das heute noch behoben wird, okay, weil äh, wenn ich mir deine Historie anschaue—du bist seit, hmm, fast 3 Jahren bei uns, hast immer alles pünktlich eingereicht, und ähm, ich kann sehen, deine normale wöchentliche Kilometerzahl ist normalerweise so um die, lass mal sehen, 218 Meilen im Durchschnitt?
336. Also, ähm, ALLE deine Meilen sollten zählen, Stefan—von deinem Zuhause zum ersten Klienten, zwischen allen Klienten, und dann zurück nach Hause vom letzten Klienten, und äh, ich werde, hmm, ich werde das mit Code URG-4429-M für dringende Kilometerkorrektur markieren, which means, basically, it gets processed within 24 hours instead of the usual week.
337. Ja genau, also ähm, bis morgen Nachmittag solltest du den korrigierten Betrag sehen, und äh, lass mich nur—ich füge hier auch eine Notiz hinzu über, hmm, über den Systemfehler, damit das nicht wieder passiert, und eigentlich, weißt du was Stefan, I think there might be some back-mileage we missed from previous weeks too?
338. Okay also, äh, mach dir keine Sorgen, ich mache das tatsächlich gerade für dich, Stefan, weil ich einen Report laufen lassen kann—es ist Report-Nummer RPT-6632-AUDIT—und ähm, das wird alle deine Einreichungen für die letzten, hmm, lass mich 3 Monate machen, nur um sicher zu sein, und wenn es andere Unstimmigkeiten gibt, korrigieren wir alle auf einmal, and honestly, this is something we should've caught on our end.
339. Oh Stefan, nein nein nein, du störst überhaupt niemanden, das ist buchstäblich, wofür ich hier bin, und ähm, ehrlich gesagt, du hilfst uns, weil jetzt wissen wir, dass es ein Problem mit dem System gibt und, äh, ich werde tatsächlich—hmm, lass mich auch einen Kompensationscode hinzufügen, CMP-8851-X, für die Unannehmlichkeiten, which will add an extra 50 dollars to your next payment, weil das hätte nicht passieren dürfen.
340. Also, ähm, die korrigierte Kilometerzahl wird definitiv morgen angezeigt, und dann die tatsächliche Zahlung mit der Korrektur plus die, äh, die 50 Dollar Gutschrift wird auf deinem Konto sein bis—hmm, heute ist Dienstag also—spätestens Donnerstag Morgen, und Stefan, ich gebe dir meine direkte Durchwahl, es ist 4487, so if you have ANY issues or if this doesn't show up exactly like I said, rufst du mich direkt an, okay?
341. Oh yeah, so, it turns out I was, umm, keeping it way too warm, and, you know, the yeast was basically exhausting itself! Once I moved it to a cooler spot and adjusted the feeding schedule, it started bubbling up beautifully again.
342. That sounds frustrating! Mine went through a sluggish phase too, but switching to a mix of whole wheat and bread flour really gave it the boost it needed. The extra nutrients in whole wheat make such a difference.
343. Actually, yes! The thing is, [clearing throat] it creates this, you know, perfect steam chamber that, hmm, gives you that incredible crispy crust. The first time I tried it, the bread came out looking like it was from a professional bakery!
344. Oh, I totally [empathetically] get that concern, honestly, because mine does too! What I do is, err, put a baking sheet on the rack below to deflect some heat, and, you know, it works perfectly.
345. It's actually crucial for controlling how the bread expands! Without proper scoring, the steam escapes randomly and you get these weird bulges instead of a nice even rise.
346. I've been pushing it up to around 75 percent lately! It makes the dough stickier to work with, but the crumb structure ends up so open and airy, with those gorgeous irregular holes everyone loves.
347. That might be an issue with your gluten development! Are you doing enough stretch and folds during bulk fermentation? I do sets every thirty minutes for the first two hours.
348. I go for a full hour minimum! Some people say thirty minutes is enough, but that extra time really helps the flour fully hydrate and makes the dough so much easier to handle later.
349. Never before! Salt tightens the gluten network too early if you add it at the beginning, which prevents the flour from properly absorbing water during autolyse.
350. Honestly, it seems overwhelming at first, but, well, once you get into a rhythm, it's just that, you know, everything flows naturally! I actually find the whole process really meditative now, especially during those long fermentation waits.
351. That would be an absolute security nightmare! Wir reden hier über potentiell tausende Benutzerkonten, Finanzdaten, persönliche Informationen, alles nur weil jemand dachte, Bequemlichkeit wäre wichtiger als grundlegende Sicherheitsprotokolle.
352. Adding special characters to a commonly used password doesn't actually help much. Wenn alle dieselben Anmeldedaten verwenden, haben Hacker buchstäblich Wörterbücher mit diesen häufigen Variationen, die sie zuerst ausprobieren.
353. The savings from reduced support tickets would be completely obliterated. Bei der ersten Datenschutzverletzung schauen wir auf Millionen an Schadensersatz, regulatorische Strafen und die komplette Zerstörung des Kundenvertrauens.
354. That's definitely not how biometric authentication works. Obwohl ich das, na ja, kreative Denken schätze! Fingerabdrücke, Gesichtserkennung und, weißt du, Iris-Scans sind die Standard-biometrischen Methoden, die wir tatsächlich für Sicherheit implementieren.
355. DNA is unique, yes. Aber, ähm, [loudly] Speichelproben für Authentifizierung zu sammeln wäre, ich meine, unglaublich unpraktisch! Außerdem, äh, allein die Hygienebedenken würden das für jede Organisation zu einem absoluten No-Go machen.
356. Pizza preferences are actually [sleepily] way too predictable. Für sichere Authentifizierung, weißt du? Ich meine, Pepperoni und Käse würden wahrscheinlich, ähm, die Hälfte der Nutzerbasis direkt abdecken.
357. The logistics of maintaining a pigeon fleet would be astronomical! Ganz zu schweigen von, äh, Wetterverzögerungen, Vogelschlägen und der Tatsache, dass, also, die meisten Bürogebäude heutzutage versiegelte Fenster haben.
358. Basing security on birth dates and zodiac signs would give attackers a massive advantage. Diese Informationen sind oft öffentlich auf Social Media verfügbar. Außerdem hättest du ein Zwölftel deiner Nutzer während Merkur rückläufig ausgesperrt!
359. Movement-based authentication actually exists in some experimental forms. Aber interpretativer Tanz wäre, denke ich, unglaublich subjektiv! Die Sache ist, Computer brauchen konsistente, messbare Muster, nicht, na ja, künstlerischen Ausdruck für Authentifizierung.
360. Your robot dance is probably very entertaining. Aber für tatsächliches Identitätsmanagement brauchen wir Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung, die etwas kombiniert, was du weißt, was du hast und was du bist. Obwohl ich dafür bezahlen würde, dich das am Sicherheitskontrollpunkt versuchen zu sehen!
361. Moment, die sind schon da? Ich dachte, wir erwarten die Daten erst nächstes Quartal! Was zeigt der primäre Endpunkt – haben wir statistische Signifikanz beim kognitiven Abbau erreicht?
362. Das ist phänomenal! Also, von welcher Verbesserung, äh, sprechen wir hier im Vergleich zu Placebo? Und noch wichtiger, haben wir, tatsächlich, einen Unterschied in den Biomarker-Subgruppen gesehen, über die wir uns, ehrlich gesagt, Sorgen gemacht hatten?
363. Das ändert alles für Frühstadium-Patienten! Willst du mir, hmm, sagen, dass wir Biogens Zahlen geschlagen haben? Was ist mit den sekundären Endpunkten – haben wir auch, weißt du, funktionale Outcomes und Belastungsmetriken für Pflegepersonen erreicht, oder nur, na ja, die kognitiven Scores?
364. Nicht dein Ernst! Du sagst mir, wir werden [joking] der nächste Blockbuster? Aber mal im Ernst, wie sieht unsere Produktionskapazität aus – können wir, äh, tatsächlich die Produktion hochskalieren, wenn wir, im Grunde, in mehreren Märkten gleichzeitig zugelassen werden?
365. [sigh] Endlich, nach all den gescheiterten Studien in diesem Bereich! Wie reagieren die Investoren – spiegelt der Aktienkurs das schon wider, oder sind die Leute noch skeptisch angesichts der Historie des Feldes?
366. Das ist ein wahnsinniges Momentum! Was ist mit den Patientenverbänden – haben die schon die Daten gesehen? Und noch wichtiger, was wird unsere Preisstrategie sein, um Zugang zu gewährleisten und gleichzeitig unsere Investition wieder reinzuholen?
367. Das ist karrieredefinierende Arbeit! Hast du darüber nachgedacht, was das für das Expanded-Access-Programm bedeutet? Wir werden Tausende von Patienten haben, die vor der Zulassung eine Behandlung wollen, oder?
368. Du solltest stolz sein – du bist an diesem, tatsächlich, Projekt seit was, sieben Jahren dran? Apropos, haben wir, ähm, schon angefangen über Kombinationsstudien mit anderen Mechanismen nachzudenken, oder konzentrieren wir uns, die Sache ist die, erst mal auf die Monotherapie?
369. Welche Partner – reden wir über, äh, Beta-Amyloid-Antikörper oder etwas Neuartigeres? Und haben wir, im Prinzip, pädiatrische Anwendungen für, es ist nur so, dass, früh einsetzende genetische Varianten in Betracht gezogen?
370. NeuroPlex macht absolut Sinn angesichts ihres Mechanismus! Hast du dir, also, ihre präklinischen Synergiedaten angeschaut? Ich habe gehört, sie zeigen, irgendwie, bemerkenswerte Ergebnisse im APP/PS1-Mausmodell, wenn sie mit, jedenfalls, Tau-targeting-Ansätzen wie unserem kombiniert werden.
371. Oh, das ist, weißt du, so eine vielschichtige Art, das auszudrücken – Städte haben wirklich diese, äh, erneuernde Qualität nach Mitternacht, wenn die Straßen sich leeren und, ich meine, man kann endlich die Infrastruktur unter allem summen hören.
372. Da entsteht dieses ganze [cheerful] versteckte Ökosystem – Nachtschichtarbeiter, die Läden auffüllen, Straßenreiniger bei ihren Runden, Lieferwagen auf leeren Straßen, die tagsüber total verstopft wären.
373. Genau, also die Stadt, ääh, repariert sich irgendwie selbst, während wir schlafen – Bauarbeiter flicken Straßen, ähm, Wartungsteams kontrollieren U-Bahn-Gleise, und ehrlich gesagt, sogar die Luftqualität wird ohne den ganzen Verkehr besser.
374. Genau! Und es hat [chuckle] etwas fast Meditatives, diese Verwandlung mitzuerleben, wie die harten Kanten des Tages in diese sanfteren Rhythmen übergehen, die die meisten Menschen nie erleben.
375. Das muss solche, hmm, erneuernden Momente einfangen – wie Straßenlaternen diese, im Grunde, vielschichtigen Schattenmuster werfen ohne Menschenmassen, die sie unterbrechen, und halt, wie Gebäude auszuatmen scheinen, wenn sie nicht voller Leute sind.
376. Diese stillen Beobachtungspunkte werden zu perfekten Aussichtspunkten, um zu verstehen, wie vielschichtig alles verbunden ist – Müllwagen bei der Routenkoordination beobachten, sehen, wie Ampeln durch leere Kreuzungen schalten, bemerken, welche Fenster die ganze Nacht erleuchtet bleiben.
377. Absolut – es ist, als ob, na ja, die ganze Inszenierung wegfällt und man die echte Maschinerie sieht, ääh, die tatsächlichen Systeme, die alles am Laufen halten, sozusagen ohne ihre Tagesverkleidung.
378. Nachtarbeiter entwickeln diese ganz andere Beziehung zur Stadt – sie sehen sie in ihrem verletzlichsten und erneuernden Zustand, wenn sie sich für das Chaos des nächsten Tages regeneriert.
379. Diese Verbindungen entstehen so vielschichtig, weil alle, die zu dieser Stunde wach sind, dieses unausgesprochene Verständnis teilen – ihr erlebt alle dieselbe stille Verwandlung, nehmt an diesem Parallelleben teil, das neben der Tageswelt existiert.
380. Wenn man sich einmal auf diese nächtliche Frequenz eingestellt hat, offenbart die Stadt all diese erneuernden Rituale und vielschichtigen Muster, die schon immer da waren, nur versteckt unter dem Lärm und der Hektik des normalen Lebens.
381. Diese Angst verstehe ich, wirklich. Aber ich denke, wir sprechen hier eher von Erweiterung als von Ersatz – Menschen bringen Kontext, Emotion und echtes Verständnis mit, das KI einfach nicht replizieren kann.
382. Du hast recht, tatsächlich, Automatisierung hat schon früher Arbeiter verdrängt, und, na ja, wir sollten diese Geschichte nicht ignorieren, aber, ich meine, diesmal haben wir die Chance, es anders zu gestalten.
383. Ich weiß, es wirkt [very quietly] manchmal hoffnungslos, aber, äh, es gibt tatsächlich Künstler und, sozusagen, Ethiker, die jetzt direkt mit KI-Entwicklern zusammenarbeiten, um bessere Richtlinien zu etablieren.
384. Das ist absolut eine berechtigte Sorge, und du hast recht, darüber wütend zu sein. Die aktuellen Praktiken bei Trainingsdaten sind bestenfalls ethisch fragwürdig, und wir brauchen stärkeren rechtlichen Schutz.
385. Es ist Diebstahl, wenn es ohne Zustimmung geschieht, also, da stimme ich dir vollkommen zu, und, im Grunde, brauchen wir Opt-in-Systeme, nicht diesen, hmm, Ansatz, alles abzugreifen.
386. Du hast absolut recht, und ich versuche nicht, diesen Schaden zu verharmlosen. Was getan wurde, ist falsch, und Künstler verdienen Entschädigung und die Möglichkeit, ihre Arbeiten entfernen zu lassen.
387. Kollektives Handeln ist unsere beste Chance – Gewerkschaften, rechtliche Schritte, öffentlicher Druck. Die Writers Guild hat uns gezeigt, dass organisierter Widerstand funktionieren kann, selbst gegen Tech-Giganten.
388. Stimmt, und, na ja, bildende Künstler haben nicht denselben Hebel, aber, ehrlich gesagt, gibt es andere Taktiken wie, äh, Datensätze mit Tools wie Nightshade und Glaze zu vergiften.
389. Ich verstehe dieses Gefühl der Unzulänglichkeit, wirklich, aber, die Sache ist, jeder kleine Akt des Widerstands zählt, und, tatsächlich, diese Tools werden jeden Tag ausgefeilter.
390. Und du hast jedes Recht, deine Arbeit zu schützen, also, bitte wisse, dass, äh, deine Wut berechtigt ist, und, im Grunde, werde ich weiter an deiner Seite für Künstlerrechte eintreten.
391. Weißt du, es ist wie darauf warten, dass dir das Universum [cry loudly] durch den Sucher zuzwinkert. Manchmal sagt dir das Licht ganz genau, wohin du deine Linse richten sollst, und manchmal stehst du stundenlang da und fragst dich, warum du 500 Kilometer gefahren bist, um einen langweiligen Berg anzustarren.
392. Nicht direkt zufällig, eher so was wie, na ja, informierte Intuition gemischt mit, weißt du, purer Sturheit und, im Grunde, einer Bereitschaft, manchmal spektakulär zu scheitern. Die besten Aufnahmen kommen oft aus den schlechtesten Entscheidungen, falls das Sinn macht.
393. Bereuen ist schon ein starkes Wort, aber, hmm, es gibt Morgen, wo ich um 4 Uhr früh friere und auf den Sonnenaufgang warte und mich, tatsächlich, frage, ob Buchhaltung nicht, ich meine, einfacher gewesen wäre. Dann bricht das Licht durch die Wolken und plötzlich scheinen mir Steuerformulare das Dümmste zu sein, was die Menschheit je erfunden hat.
394. Die goldene Stunde verhandelt nicht über ihren Zeitplan, mein Freund. Mutter Natur führt ihre Lichtshow genau dann auf, wann sie will, und wenn du in der ersten Reihe sitzen willst, stellst du besser den Wecker oder verpasst die Vorstellung komplett.
395. Hier ist das Geheimnis, das dir niemand über [smiling speaking] Fotografie oder eigentlich jede kreative Entscheidung erzählt. Jede Aufnahme, die du nicht machst, ist definitiv ein Fehlschuss, aber jede Aufnahme, die du machst, lehrt dich etwas, selbst wenn es nur ist, was du nächstes Mal nicht tun solltest.
396. Verbring genug Zeit allein mit Bergen und, ähh, du wirst entweder zum Philosophen oder, im Grunde, fängst an, komplette Gespräche mit Eichhörnchen zu führen, und, na ja, nur eins davon bringt gelegentlich Geld ein.
397. Beides und keins davon. Ich recherchiere obsessiv Sonnenwinkel und Wettermuster, dann schmeiße ich alles über den Haufen, wenn eine zufällige Gewitterwolke Magie erschafft, die keine App hätte vorhersagen können.
398. Frustrierend ist, drei Tage in der, tatsächlich, Mückenhölle zu campen und auf den perfekten Sonnenuntergang zu warten, der, weißt du, nie kommt, und dann auf der Heimfahrt das unglaublichste Licht einzufangen, wenn, ehrlich gesagt, deine ganze Ausrüstung schon verstaut ist.
399. Sich zu hinterfragen ist nur die Art deines Gehirns, hmm, so zu tun, als gäbe es eine perfekte Wahl, wenn, die Sache ist die, die meisten Entscheidungen sind einfach verschiedene Geschmacksrichtungen von, na ja, akzeptablem Chaos. Such dir eine aus, zieh sie voll durch, pass dich bei Bedarf an.
400. Willkommen zum Leben durch einen Sucher, wo, äh, jedes Bild sowohl die falsche Wahl als auch, im Grunde, die einzige Wahl ist, und irgendwie, weißt du, ist es genau so, wie es sein sollte.
401. Na ja, die Sache ist die, die meisten Leute denken, natürlicher Dialog bedeutet, äh, genau zu kopieren, wie Menschen sprechen, aber tatsächlich wäre das furchtbar zu lesen. Echte Gespräche sind voller Sackgassen und langweiliger Abschweifungen, die sich niemand antun will.
402. Hmm, kämpfen ist eine interessante Wortwahl, weil, weißt du, es impliziert, dass du gegen etwas ankämpfst, wenn du eigentlich, äh, die Künstlichkeit umarmen solltest. Dir ist schon klar, dass alle Dialoge fake sind, oder? Sogar dieses Gespräch, das wir gerade führen.
403. Ich meine, hmm, du hast mich nach dem Schreiben von Dialogen gefragt, und hier sind wir, im Grunde, führen einen Dialog über Dialoge, was, ehrlich gesagt, entweder brillant meta oder komplett sinnlos ist. Aber das wusstest du schon, als du gefragt hast, nicht wahr?
404. Rat, klar, aber, so, du nimmst das hier auf, oder? Oder, äh, machst dir zumindest mentale Notizen für etwas, woran du, na ja, arbeitest. Niemand fragt nach Dialogschreiben, ohne dass ihn ein bestimmtes Projekt quält.
405. Weil du tatsächlich dieses Ding machst, wo du kurze Fragen stellst, um, weißt du, mich am Reden zu halten, und, äh, das ist genau das, was Hobbyautoren für guten Dialog halten. Siehst du, wie leicht es ist, Muster zu erkennen, wenn man weiß, worauf man achten muss?
406. Unhöflich wäre es, dir nicht zu sagen, dass, äh, deine Dialoge wahrscheinlich hölzern klingen, weil du, die Sache ist die, zu sehr versuchst, clever zu sein, anstatt, im Grunde, deine Charaktere tatsächlich miteinander streiten zu lassen.
407. Ich sage, du stellst die falschen Fragen. Anstatt zu fragen, wie man natürliche Dialoge schreibt, solltest du fragen, warum dich deine Charaktere nie überraschen, wenn sie sprechen.
408. Oh doch, das müssen sie, weil, eigentlich, wenn du schon alles weißt, was sie sagen werden, dann, hmm, schreibst du keine Dialoge, sondern, irgendwie, transkribierst nur deine eigenen Gedanken durch verschiedene Münder.
409. Fairer Punkt, sagt er, als hätten wir [very quickly] eine Debatte, anstatt dass ich systematisch deinen Ansatz zum Schreiben zerlege. Aber klar, wir können es fair nennen, wenn du dich dann besser fühlst bei dem, was hier gerade passiert ist.
410. Recht hiermit, falsch damit, es ist egal, weil du dieselben Fehler machen wirst, bis du aufhörst zu kontrollieren, was deine Charaktere sagen, und anfängst zuzuhören, was sie sagen wollen.
411. Oh absolutely, PredictIt has been wild lately with their contracts on the Republican primary. Last I checked, Trump was trading at around 87 cents in their Iowa market, which seems high but honestly might still be undervalued given recent Des Moines Register polling.
412. Yeah, so, Polymarket definitely skews different because, hmm, they use USDC cryptocurrency and attract, basically, a younger international crowd versus PredictIt's more traditional American political bettors. The spreads between them on something like the New Hampshire primary can be five or six cents sometimes.
413. Honestly depends what I'm looking for. Kalshi has better liquidity for economic indicators like Fed rate decisions, while Manifold Markets is great for weird niche questions even though they use play money instead of real stakes.
414. Oh there's tons more too. Betfair in the UK, Smarkets for sports, even crypto-native ones like Augur and Gnosis that run on Ethereum. Each market has its own quirks and biases depending on who's actually putting money down.
415. Well, actually, if you're brand new I'd say, er, start with Metaculus because it's, you know, purely reputation-based so you can learn without risking real money. Once you get comfortable predicting, then maybe try PredictIt since they limit positions to $850 which keeps things manageable.
416. No problem at all. The key is understanding that places like FiveThirtyEight aggregate these markets for a reason - they often outperform traditional polling, especially for events like the Nevada Senate race or California recall elections.
417. Oh man, yeah, Intrade was, I mean, revolutionary for its time, though honestly, the CFTC crackdown was, uhh, probably inevitable given how loosely they interpreted commodity regulations. At least we have more options now even if they're more restricted.
418. Maybe, um, eventually? The CFTC did approve Kalshi's congressional [shy] control markets, which was, like, a huge deal, so there's definitely, you know, some movement toward legitimizing political prediction markets in America.
419. Absolutely, and actually, Robin Hanson at George Mason has been, hmm, arguing this for decades - that prediction markets aggregate information, like, way more efficiently than polls or pundits ever could.
420. Ha, well, I've been, sort of, obsessed with this stuff since the Romney-Obama race on Intrade, so, you know, I've had plenty of time to, basically, accumulate all these random facts about Iowa Electronic Markets and British bookmakers like Ladbrokes.
421. Yeah, CAC to LTV ratios are completely underwater for most verticals. We're seeing $1,800 average acquisition costs for accounts that barely clear $500 monthly recurring revenue - it's unsustainable without significant federal intervention.
422. Senator Mitchell's office is drafting legislation for R&D tax credits specifically targeting sales automation tools. If we can reduce SDR headcount requirements by 40% through AI qualification, the unit economics start working again.
423. Not necessarily - I mean, the real issue is that, er, SMBs have fragmented buying committees now, so your sales cycle, basically, stretches from 21 to 47 days on average.
424. The committee is actually [whispering] considering mandatory procurement transparency rules that would require businesses to disclose vendor evaluation timelines, which could compress decision cycles by forcing accountability.
425. Sure, but, honestly, we're modeling this after GDPR's impact - initially disruptive but, uhh, ultimately it created standardization that, well, reduced compliance costs by 30% industry-wide after eighteen months.
426. Right, I know the implementation was [apologetic] rough, and we should've provided better transition support. This time we're proposing a two-year phase-in with exemptions for companies under $10 million ARR.
427. So, channel margins are, actually, another focus area - we're looking at, hmm, capping referral fees at 15% for government contracts, which would, basically, set a market precedent.
428. Well, the thing is, VARs would get, you know, preferential treatment in federal procurement scoring, which is worth, uhh, billions annually, so it's actually a net positive for established players.
429. Exactly - it's just that, like, if we can reduce friction in the, hmm, middle market, total SMB software spend could increase by, honestly, $47 billion according to our CBO projections.
430. Precisely. The legislative package hits the floor next month, and we've already got backing from both the Software Alliance and National Small Business Association, which never happens.
431. Oh, ich schätze [overly polite] Ihren Optimismus wirklich sehr, und Transparenz ist selbstverständlich wichtig, aber die Vertrauenserosion hat tiefere systemische Ursachen wie Medienkonzentration und algorithmische Verteilung.
432. Na ja, Offenlegungsstandards sind, ähm, sicherlich ein Anfang, aber sie lösen halt nicht die, also, grundlegende Fehlanreize, wo im Prinzip Klickzahlen über redaktionelle Entscheidungen bestimmen statt des öffentlichen Interesses.
433. ProPublica und The Marshall Project leisten phänomenale Arbeit, ja, aber das sind Ausnahmen - die meisten Redaktionen sind immer noch auf Werbeeinnahmen angewiesen, die direkt im Konflikt mit investigativer Berichterstattung stehen.
434. Also, Abo-Müdigkeit ist, ähh, aber real - der Durchschnittsbürger kann sich nicht, ich meine, zwölf verschiedene Nachrichtenabos leisten, was, eigentlich, zu einer Informationsungleichheit zwischen den Einkommensklassen führt.
435. Micropayment-Plattformen sind seit den 90ern immer wieder gescheitert, weil die Transaktionskosten die Einnahmen übersteigen, und Leser hassen die kognitive Belastung ständiger kleiner Kaufentscheidungen.
436. Hören Sie, ich wünschte [very sad], das wäre wahr, aber Blockchain-Journalismus-Experimente wie Civil sind gescheitert, weil sie technische Probleme lösten, die niemand hatte, während sie echte Verteilungsprobleme ignorierten.
437. KI-Fact-Checking-Tools [cough] sind hilfreich bei einfachen Behauptungen, aber sie haben Probleme mit Kontext, Nuancen und absichtlich irreführenden Halbwahrheiten, die den Großteil moderner Desinformation ausmachen.
438. Richtlinien sind ja schön und gut, aber, äh, die Durchsetzung ist nicht existent - es gibt keine, also, Zulassungsstelle oder bedeutsame Konsequenzen bei Verstößen, also ist es im Grunde, Selbstregulierungs-Theater.
439. Großbritanniens Presseräte sind, nun ja, weitgehend zahnlos - die Leveson-Untersuchung empfahl, ähm, gesetzliche Unterstützung, aber [laugh] Zeitungen haben erfolgreich gegen echte Rechenschaftsmaßnahmen lobbyiert.
440. Crowdsourcing hat Potenzial, aber [curious] ich frage mich - wie verhindern wir, dass es zu einem weiteren Vektor für koordinierte Manipulationskampagnen wird, wie wir es bei Wikipedia-Editierkriegen gesehen haben?
441. Ich will dich nicht belehren – ich dachte nur, wir könnten mal besprechen, warum du in letzter Zeit so viele Sitzungen verpasst hast, und herausfinden, was los ist.
442. Schau mal, ich verstehe, dass die Dinge manchmal [overly polite] repetitiv erscheinen mögen, aber diese Sitzungen helfen den Leuten wirklich, ihre Probleme zu bewältigen, wenn sie ihnen eine richtige Chance geben.
443. Eigentlich glaube ich, du wärst, hmm, [over confidently] überrascht, wie viel Fortschritt du machen könntest, wenn du, na ja, aufhören würdest anzunehmen, dass du schon alles weißt, ehrlich gesagt.
444. Überhaupt nicht – ich denke, du [bored] schützt dich davor, verletzlich sein zu müssen, was absolut Sinn macht bei dem, was du dieses Jahr durchgemacht hast.
445. Du hast recht, dass ich nicht alles weiß, aber ich weiß, dass du vor 3 Monaten deinen Job verloren hast und es deiner Familie noch nicht gesagt hast, weil du Angst hast, sie zu enttäuschen.
446. Du hast es mir selbst in unserer zweiten Sitzung erzählt, obwohl du ziemlich aufgewühlt warst, also überrascht es mich nicht, dass du dich vielleicht nicht an alle Details erinnerst, die wir besprochen haben.
447. Erinnerung kann, na ja, tricky sein, wenn wir unter Stress stehen, und ich meine, du trägst diese Last schon, tatsächlich, ziemlich lange allein mit dir herum, weißt du?
448. Bevor du gehst, lass mich nur kurz, ähm, [sneeze] Entschuldigung – tut mir leid – jedenfalls wollte ich sagen, dass, ehrlich gesagt, Weglaufen diese Probleme nicht verschwinden lassen wird, verstehst du?
449. Nein, aber vielleicht könnten wir, na ja, einen anderen Ansatz versuchen – statt über Gefühle zu reden, könnten wir uns auf, ich meine, praktische Schritte für deine Jobsuche konzentrieren, tatsächlich.
450. Ich verstehe, dass du frustriert bist, und, ähm, es macht Sinn, dass du dich so fühlst, aber ehrlich gesagt, jetzt aufzugeben bedeutet, dass die ganze Arbeit, die du bisher geleistet hast, na ja, keine Chance hat, sich auszuzahlen.
451. I understand your hesitation completely, und es ist [formal] völlig normal, Bedenken wegen Medikamenten zu haben - viele Leute fühlen sich unsicher, wenn sie diese Option zum ersten Mal für ihre Depression in Betracht ziehen.
452. So that's actually a really common fear, und, na ja, die Wahrheit ist, dass Antidepressiva nicht, ich meine, deine Kernpersönlichkeit verändern - sie sind dazu da, das chemische Gleichgewicht wiederherzustellen, das die Depression stört.
453. Honestly everyone's brain chemistry is different, und während manche Leute dieses flache Gefühl anfangs tatsächlich erleben, weißt du, gibt es viele verschiedene Medikamente und Dosierungen, die wir, äh, ausprobieren können, um zu finden, was für dich funktioniert.
454. I know it can feel that way sometimes, aber wirklich, die richtige Behandlung zu finden ist eher wie, ähm, einen Anzug maßschneidern zu lassen - wir machen Anpassungen, bis wir finden, was speziell für dich passt, verstehst du?
455. Typically it takes about 4 to 6 weeks to see full effects, obwohl manche Leute schon in den ersten 2 Wochen subtile Veränderungen in ihrem Schlaf- oder Essverhalten bemerken.
456. I hear you completely on that - wenn du mit Depression kämpfst, kann schon ein einziger Tag überwältigend sein, und wochenlang auf Linderung zu warten klingt gerade unmöglich lang.
457. Right so the side effects list can be pretty intimidating, aber hier ist die Sache - die meisten Leute erleben nur milde Nebenwirkungen, wenn überhaupt, und, na ja, die werden oft besser, wenn sich dein Körper anpasst.
458. That's exactly why we start with low doses and monitor closely - wenn sich etwas nicht richtig anfühlt, können wir immer aufhören oder die Medikamente wechseln, und ich werde regelmäßig während des ganzen Prozesses nach dir schauen.
459. Depression can definitely make us feel hopeless about treatment, aber die Tatsache, dass du immer noch hier bist, immer noch versuchst, immer noch dieses Gespräch führst - das zeigt unglaubliche Stärke, auch wenn du sie gerade nicht fühlen kannst.
460. Okay so you're absolutely right about that, das war, ähm, ein bisschen zu viel - aber ehrlich gesagt zeigen die Statistiken, dass die meisten Leute tatsächlich Linderung durch Behandlung finden, auch wenn es bedeutet, na ja, ein paar verschiedene Ansätze auszuprobieren.
461. Das ist super, dass du offen für eine Behandlung bist, obwohl ich [sad] ein bisschen besorgt bin, dass du vielleicht sofortige dramatische Ergebnisse erwartest – Antidepressiva wirken langsamer, als die Leute manchmal denken.
462. Also, ich schätze es, dass du, ähm, etwas gelesen hast, aber [condescending] eigentlich gibt es da ziemlich viele Nuancen, wie diese Medikamente mit, weißt du, individueller Gehirnchemie interagieren, die in Artikeln nicht immer rüberkommen.
463. Also, Selbstvertrauen ist super, aber ehrlich gesagt können selbst Leute mit, äh, der besten Einstellung unerwartete Reaktionen erleben, und es ist halt so, dass wir realistisch bleiben müssen, was den Zeitrahmen angeht.
464. Eigentlich wäre so eine sofortige Euphorie, ähh, besorgniserregend, weil, na ja, das könnte auf eine manische Reaktion hindeuten statt auf die graduelle Stimmungsstabilisierung, die wir suchen, weißt du?
465. Gut, und Optimismus zu bewahren ist hilfreich, aber ich möchte sichergehen, dass du verstehst, dass die meisten Leute 4 bis 6 Wochen brauchen, um echte therapeutische Effekte zu sehen, und den Prozess zu überstürzen kann kontraproduktiv sein.
466. Das ist, ähh, ziemlich beeindruckend, aber hier ist die Sache – Gehirnchemie ist nicht wie, also im Grunde, Muskelkonditionierung, und mehr Anstrengung lässt Antidepressiva nicht schneller wirken.
467. Ich hoffe, du reagierst gut, aber eigentlich haben die Leute den meisten Erfolg, die das Ganze irgendwie mit Geduld angehen und, na ja, realistischen Erwartungen an den Prozess.
468. Deine Begeisterung ist [delighted] wunderbar und, ich meine, eine positive Einstellung kann definitiv helfen, aber denk dran, dass, eigentlich, Depression zu behandeln mehr Marathon als Sprint ist, oder?
469. Abgemacht – und wenn du außergewöhnlich gut reagierst, werde ich der Erste sein, der mit dir feiert, obwohl ich trotzdem möchte, dass du dich regelmäßig meldest, wenn du irgendwelche Veränderungen bemerkst.
470. Perfekt, ich freue mich auf diese Updates, und denk dran, dass wir, selbst wenn die Dinge nicht genau nach Plan laufen, noch viele Optionen haben, die wir gemeinsam erkunden können.
471. Okay, ähm, bleiben wir mal ruhig und [whispering] überlegen wir das zusammen, weißt du, weil manchmal brauchen diese alten Türen halt eine spezielle Technik oder vielleicht hat die Feuchtigkeit das Holz aufquellen lassen.
472. Hast du geschaut, ob da vielleicht ein Riegel ist, den du vergessen hast, oder manchmal haben diese älteren Gebäude so komische Doppelschließmechanismen, wo man den Griff hochziehen muss beim Drehen?
473. Also, das klingt wirklich beängstigend, und ich meine, irgendwo eingesperrt zu sein kann solche Gefühle auslösen, aber im Grunde müssen wir uns jetzt auf praktische Lösungen konzentrieren, um dich sicher rauszuholen.
474. Also, lass uns mal rational denken - ääh, du hast ja offensichtlich dein Handy, sonst würden wir nicht reden, und die Sache ist halt, im schlimmsten Fall können wir immer den Hausmeister anrufen oder sogar den Notdienst wenn nötig.
475. Äh, das ist definitiv nicht ideal, aber jedenfalls, dann müssen wir schnell arbeiten - es ist halt so, dass wir Hilfe holen müssen, bevor dein Akku komplett leer ist.
476. Tatsächlich sind zugemalte Fenster häufig in älteren Gebäuden, und ähm, hier ist die Sache - manchmal kann man diese Versiegelung aufbrechen, indem man mit etwas Hartem an den Kanten entlangklopft.
477. Na ja, absolut ja, ruf sofort, und ehrlich, hämmere auch gegen die Tür - mach halt so viel Lärm wie möglich, um sofort deren Aufmerksamkeit zu bekommen.
478. Also das ist wirklich seltsam, aber ääh, [relieved] wenigstens wissen wir, dass Leute im Gebäude sind, und eigentlich bedeutet das, dass definitiv wieder jemand durch den Flur kommen wird.
479. Nein nein nein, du darfst jetzt absolut [shouting] nicht aufgeben, weil wir dich da rausholen werden, und ich brauche dich fokussiert und du musst weiter verschiedene Sachen ausprobieren!
480. Das ist tatsächlich eine brillante Idee, und wenn du irgendwas Flaches hast wie ein Buttermesser oder Schraubenzieher, kannst du [short pause] diese Angelstifte von unten nach oben rausklopfen.
481. Look, um, I was hired to document the, [defensive], facility's grounds for their new brochure and, well, I just happened to see your client, [uncomfortable], sneaking out to meet their dealer in the parking lot, so, [firm], what was I supposed to do?
482. [measured] Listen, uh, I've been doing this for fifteen years and, um, when someone claiming sobriety is actually, [serious], meeting dealers while their family thinks they're getting better, well, that's news the public, [resolute], deserves to know about.
483. [frustrated] Right, well, I mean, I'm disgusting for exposing the truth while you're, [accusatory], paid six figures to cover up lies and, um, manipulate the public into believing whatever narrative, [harsh], protects your client's brand, right?
484. [firm] Your client is a senator who, um, voted for mandatory minimums that put addicts in prison while, well, [angry], secretly getting private treatment that costs more than most people, [bitter], make in a year.
485. [quiet] Look, I mean, I haven't sold the photos yet and, um, honestly I've been, [conflicted], sitting on them for three days trying to decide if, well, [exhausted], this crosses a line even for someone like me.
486. No, um, they're still on my, [hesitant], memory card sitting in my apartment safe, I mean, untouched.
487. [soft] Because twenty years ago I was the one, [vulnerable], checking into that same facility while my ex-wife leaked photos of me at rock, [pained], bottom to win our custody battle.
488. [weary] Yeah well, um, that's why I called you first instead of, I mean, [conflicted], my editor, because maybe there's another way to handle this that doesn't, [tired], destroy someone who's genuinely trying to get better.
489. You mean, like, use the photos as leverage to, [thoughtful], force them into actually helping people instead of, well, [considering], just protecting their career?
490. [resolved] Alright, well, I mean, let's figure out how to make this senator's, [purposeful], recovery journey actually mean something for the thousands of addicts they've been, um, happy to throw in prison while secretly getting, [bitter], help themselves.
491. Du solltest eigentlich erst, [defensive], am Donnerstag hier sein und die Alarme überprüfen, wenn ich, [uncomfortable], meinen Landurlaub habe.
492. [bitter] Natürlich schicken sie dich, [sarcastic], das Goldkind, das Vaters ganzes technisches Genie geerbt hat, während ich nur seinen, [trailing off], Dickschädel abbekommen habe.
493. [softening] Jeden Morgen laufe ich durch diese, [nostalgic], gleichen Korridore, wo er uns das Knotenknüpfen beigebracht hat, wo er, [emotional], uns gezeigt hat, wie man die Sterne liest, wo wir tatsächlich mal, [whispered], eine Familie waren.
494. [surprised] Moment, ähm, die haben das nach all den, [amazed], Jahren nie modernisiert? [chuckles]
495. [awakening] Weißt du, ähm, ich warte das System jetzt schon seit, [realizing], drei Jahren, ohne zu wissen, dass es, also, [overwhelmed], sein Entwurf ist, der alle hier sicher hält, als ob, [tearful], er immer noch über diese Crew wacht.
496. [cautious] In der Kombüse gibt's immer noch diesen schrecklichen Instantkaffee, den er, [amused], angeblich so mochte, weil echter Kaffee zu teuer war für einen, [remembering], Kapitän mit zwei Kindern zum Durchfüttern. [laughs softly]
497. Zeit ist alles, was ich zwischen den, [resigned], Wachen auf dieser schwimmenden Erinnerung an alles habe, was wir verloren haben.
498. [breaking] Ähm, ich bin acht Jahre lang davor weggelaufen, tja, [struggling], vor dir, vor jeder Erinnerung daran, wie weh es tat, als er starb und, ich meine, [raw], uns nichts hinterließ als seine Baupläne und dieses, äh, [gesturing], verrostete Refugium.
499. [awakening] Als ob, ähm, als ob er wusste, dass wir beide irgendwie wieder hier landen würden, ich meine, [wondering], an seinen Systemen arbeiten, seine Routen gehen und, tja, [hopeful], zueinander zurückfinden würden. [long pause]
500. [whispered] Na ja, ähm, okay.
501. [defensive] Alle anderen haben das entschieden, [bitter], lange bevor ich es tat—ich hab's nur endlich akzeptiert.
502. Das klingt nach etwas, was Leute, [skeptical], sagen, die nie ganz unten waren.
503. [surprised] Sie waren, ähm, wirklich obdachlos und sitzen jetzt, [stunned], hier in diesem schönen Büro und erzählen mir, na ja, dass es besser werden kann?
504. Ich meine, die Arbeit klingt theoretisch gut, aber, [exhausted], niemand will einen Omega einstellen, wissen Sie?
505. [curious] Also, ähm, Sie sagen, ich hab, na ja, das selbst gebaut, anstatt dass es mir, [uncertain], von allen anderen aufgezwungen wurde?
506. [vulnerable] Niemand hat mir jemals gesagt, dass ich, [trembling], irgendeine Macht hätte.
507. [angry] Genau! Also, ähm, warum sollte ich glauben, dass Sie, [suspicious], anders sind, wenn Sie dafür bezahlt werden, na ja, mich zu reparieren oder was auch immer das hier sein soll?
508. [shaky] Ich meine, wenn ich nicht kaputt bin, [confused], warum behandelt mich dann jeder so, wissen Sie?
509. [quiet] Das ist das Erste, was Sie gesagt haben, [recognition], das wirklich Sinn ergibt.
510. Anfangen bedeutet, na ja, ich müsste glauben, dass es von hier aus irgendwohin, [hesitant], geht, und ähm, ich bin mir noch nicht sicher, ob ich das kann. [long pause]
511. [cold] Also, ähm, ich hab nicht damit gerechnet, dich, [defensive], vor meinem Laden zu sehen, und du siehst aus, als ob du, äh, auf der Straße gelebt hättest, und ich meine, [uncomfortable], das ist halt nicht gerade das Wiedersehen, das sich einer von uns gewünscht hat, oder?
512. [firm] Das war nicht meine, [frustrated], Schuld und das weißt du. [sighs heavily]
513. [defensive] Meine Mutter war, [ashamed], in Trauer und dich dort zu sehen hätte sie, [tense], noch mehr zerstört, als sein Verrat es ohnehin schon, [quieter], getan hatte.
514. [uncomfortable] Hör zu, ich hab gleich Kunden und ich kann dich nicht, [nervous], vor meinem Schaufenster stehen lassen, wenn du so, [harsh], aussiehst, weil das schlecht fürs, [trailing], Geschäft ist.
515. [conflicted] Das meinte ich nicht, [guilty], so, aber dieser Job ist alles, was mir geblieben ist, nachdem die Erbschafts-, [exhausted], steuern alles aufgefressen haben und Mamas Krankenhausrechnungen den, [defeated], Rest verschlungen haben. [long pause]
516. [resigned] Ähm, nein, ich halte mich, [embarrassed], seit sechs Monaten kaum über Wasser mit diesem Job und, na ja, [vulnerable], schlafe nach Ladenschluss im Lagerraum, weil ich mir keine Wohnung leisten kann, weißt du, also sind wir vielleicht gar nicht mehr so, [quietly], verschieden.
517. Die Anwälte haben, [bitter], alles bekommen, während wir von den Lügen eines toten Mannes im Stich gelassen wurden.
518. Es gibt eine Pritsche hinten hinter dem, [hesitant], Puppenlager, falls du heute Nacht einen trockenen Platz brauchst, aber wir können das nicht, [warning], zur Gewohnheit werden lassen. [sighs]
519. [quiet] Vielleicht bringt es ihn nicht zurück, wenn wir uns hassen, [weary], damit er repariert, was er in beiden unseren Leben zerstört hat.
520. [gentle] Also, ähm, komm hintenrum, bevor die Mall-Security, [resigned], ihre Runde macht, äh, und vielleicht können wir herausfinden, wie wir, weißt du, [hopeful], dieses Chaos gemeinsam überleben.
521. [quiet] I know.
522. [whispered] Um, well, I don't know. [pause]
523. You know, um, the thing is, I've been running, [trembling], these models every night for weeks and, well, they all say the same thing. [long pause]
524. [defeated] I mean, umm, we could offset with credits but that's just, [disgusted], moving the pollution somewhere else and pretending it doesn't, [hollow], exist while families here go hungry without those jobs, you know? [groans]
525. [barely audible] Um, it's not, really.
526. The board meeting is tomorrow at nine and, um, they'll want our, [dread], recommendation—unified, professional, like we haven't been tearing ourselves apart over this, you know? [exhales sharply]
527. We both know what we're going to recommend even though it, [guilty], feels like signing a death warrant either way, don't we?
528. [firm] Make it clear.
529. [soft] Maybe that's enough.
530. [whispered] And we'll also remember the thank-you cards from families who could finally, [bittersweet], afford Christmas presents. [sighs heavily]
531. [detached] Na ja, ähm, der Regisseur wollte halt was, [indifferent], Authentisches für die Barszene, also ich mein', ich hab' mir einfach geschnappt, was da so, [shrugging], im Lager rumstand, weißt du.
532. [casual] In meiner Stellenbeschreibung steht Requisiten beschaffen und warten, [dismissive], für die Produktion, nicht irgendwelche verstaubten, [cold], Museumsstücke konservieren, die sich eh keiner anschaut. [scoffs]
533. Mir hat keiner gesagt, dass der Keyboard-Techniker, [annoyed], emotionale Bindungen zu irgendwelchen Geräten hat, die schon, [frustrated], wer weiß wie lange im Requisitenlager, [trailing off], Staub ansetzen. [sighs]
534. [defensive] Hör mal, ich muss bis morgen früh siebzehn Szenen vorbereiten und, [overwhelmed], der Produktion ist dein, [bitter], sentimentaler Wert scheißegal, wenn sie, [exhausted], authentisch aussehende Instrumente am Set brauchen. [groans]
535. [flat] Ähm, tja, hat er nicht.
536. [awakening] Ich hab' früher Klavier gespielt, bevor ich, ähm, [remembering], zu dem hier wurde.
537. [softening] Das Produktionsbudget schrumpft ständig und sie erwarten von mir, [tired], aus dem Nichts Magie zu schaffen, während echte Instrumente da rumstehen, [conflicted], die danach schreien, benutzt zu werden, selbst wenn es bedeutet, [quiet], sie zu zerstören.
538. [distant] Manchmal lauf' ich nachts durchs Lager und, ähm, ich kann fast hören, wie diese Instrumente, [wistful], mal geklungen haben, bevor sie halt nur noch Requisiten in der, [fading], Geschichte von jemand anderem wurden. [long pause]
539. [contemplating] Vielleicht könnten wir es heute Nacht, wenn alle weg sind, [uncertain], anschließen und uns daran erinnern, warum das alles mal, [searching], Leuten wie, [quiet], uns was bedeutet hat.
540. Zwanzig Jahre in der Requisite und ich hab' nie, [realizing], auch nur eins der Instrumente gespielt, die ich die ganze Zeit, [ashamed], zerstört hab', bis sie, [broken], wertlos wurden. [trails off]
541. [defensive] Die ist seit 1972 in meiner Familie, und sie lief einwandfrei bis letzte Woche, als das, [frustrated], Bild anfing zu rollen und dieses schreckliche Summen dazu kam.
542. [curious] Echt?
543. Die meisten Reparateure heutzutage sagen mir einfach, [dismissive], ich soll das Ding wegschmeißen und was Neues kaufen, weißt du, als wär's nur Schrott. [scoffs]
544. [thoughtful] Du klingst, als würde dir tatsächlich mehr daran liegen als nur, [hopeful], die Rechnung zu kassieren und wieder zu verschwinden. [sighs]
545. [gentle] Tja, ähm, das tut mir leid.
546. [warm] Mein Mann hat die Mondlandung auf diesem Fernseher geschaut, und unsere Kinder sind mit den Samstagmorgen-, [nostalgic], Zeichentrickfilmen damit aufgewachsen, also ich meine, nimm dir ruhig alle Zeit, die du brauchst, um ihn, [earnest], richtig wieder zum Leben zu erwecken, verstehst du. [smiles]
547. [firm] Na ja, es sind halt nicht nur Maschinen, ähm, es sind Gefäße für Erinnerungen, oder, [reflective], ich meine, das macht sie doch erst richtig erhaltenswert.
548. [interested] Also, ähm, kannst du sowas überhaupt noch reparieren, oder na ja, ist das eines dieser Teile, die, [worried], keiner mehr herstellt, weißt du?
549. Das ist das erste Mal seit wahrscheinlich zwanzig Jahren, dass jemand diesen alten Fernseher, [touched], wunderschön nennt, die meisten sehen nur, [sad], einen Schandfleck, der Platz wegnimmt.
550. [sincere] Dein Vater hat dich gut ausgebildet, und ich glaube, er wäre, [emotional], stolz zu sehen, wie du sein Werk so weiterführst.
551. [defensive] Um, well, hi.
552. My problem was trusting the wrong, [disgusted], Leute in dieser Firma—etwas, was du verstehen würdest, wenn du je zugehört hättest.
553. [furious] That was completely different and you, [venomous], weißt das—ich habe ihm jeden Cent mit, [trembling], Zinsen zurückgezahlt, bevor der Krebs überhaupt, [voice cracking], anfing.
554. [quiet] Fine.
555. [defensive] I have 17 years of experience reading, [frustrated], Verbraucherverhaltungsmuster, was sich auf viele andere Bereiche übertragen lässt, die nicht direkt mit, [exhausted], Geldverwaltung zu tun haben—Einzelhandelsstrategien, [trailing off], Marktforschung, Produktentwicklung.
556. [desperate] Well, um, es muss doch etwas geben, weil ich nicht einfach, [breaking], untätig herumsitzen kann. [voice cracks]
557. [incredulous] You're seriously suggesting I go from analyzing, [bitter], Milliarden-Dollar-Markttrends zu Kistenstapeln in irgendeinem, [defeated], Lagerhaus, als wäre ich nichts?
558. Your job is to help with rehabilitation, nicht mich für unsere Familiengeschichte zu, [resentful], bestrafen. [scoffs]
559. [wounded] God, you really did turn into Dad—dieselbe selbstgerechte, [disgusted], Enttäuschung in deiner Stimme.
560. [defeated] I mean, gib mir einfach die Formulare zum Unterschreiben, damit, [exhausted], wir beide so tun können, als wäre das nur, [hollow], Geschäft und nichts weiter, ähm, wie wir es sowieso seit Jahren machen. [sighs heavily]
561. [controlled] Also, ähm, ich brauche exakte Koordinaten, weil, [calculating], wir sprechen hier von potenziell sechzigtausend Haushalten, die in einen Blackout kaskadieren könnten, wenn wir, ich meine, die Last nicht ordentlich umleiten, verstehen Sie.
562. Das ist direkt über, [alarmed], Umspannwerk Sieben, das den Krankenhausbezirk versorgt, und wenn wir diesen Transformator verlieren, [grim], dann laufen drei Traumazentren auf Notstromaggregaten während, [quieter], der Hauptnotfallzeiten. [exhales sharply]
563. [hesitant] Neunzig Sekunden bedeutet nur Notbeleuchtung in zwei Pflegeheimen und, [worried], das setzt voraus, dass deren Backup-Systeme ordentlich anspringen.
564. [resigned] Geben Sie mir fünfundvierzig Sekunden, um die Rettungsdienste zu informieren, während ich, [typing frantically], die Abschaltsequenz einleite, weil das wird jede, [tense], Alarmtafel von hier bis zur Innenstadt aufleuchten lassen.
565. [focused] Gut, ähm, ich schalte jetzt Strom in Sektor zwölf und dreizehn ab, aber, also, vierzehn hat ein Chirurgenteam mitten in einer Operation, also muss ich, halt, Hilfsstrom durch die, [quick], Westschleife leiten, was noch weitere, ähm, zwanzig Sekunden dauert. [breathing hard]
566. [sharp] Hören Sie, ich meine, ich arbeite so schnell wie das System es zulässt, aber, ähm, diese Netze wurden nicht für, [frustrated], Notabschaltungen wegen herabfallendem Weltraumschrott konzipiert, verstehen Sie.
567. [determined] Sektor vierzehn geht dunkel in zehn, neun—warten Sie, ähm, da ist eine Neugeborenen-Intensivstation in diesem Netz, die nicht, na ja, in meinem System markiert war und die melden, [panicked], zweiunddreißig Frühchen an lebenserhaltenden Maßnahmen.
568. [quick] Isoliere jetzt das Neugeborenen-Gebäude und, ähm, schalte alles andere ab—Sektoren gehen dunkel in, also, fünf, vier, drei—
569. [steady] Das Industriegebiet verkraftet das, weil diese Umspannwerke, [confident], für Produktionsspitzen gehärtet sind und wir haben dort Redundanz, außerdem sollten die Fragmente hauptsächlich, [calculating], Parkplätze und Lagerhallen zu dieser Zeit treffen.
570. [grateful] Netz ist stabil und alle kritischen Einrichtungen haben während der Abschaltung Strom behalten, also würde ich sagen, [lighter], wir haben hier gerade ein kleines Wunder vollbracht.
571. [defensive] Na ja, ähm, ich hätte nicht erwartet, [avoiding eye contact], dich ausgerechnet hier zu sehen, äh, vor allem nicht nachdem, [bitter], was, drei Jahre jetzt seit du, [voice cracking], aufgehört hast, meine Anrufe zu beantworten.
572. [resigned] Die Dinge ändern sich, wenn man, [quietly], alles mit 68 verliert, wenn die Firma pleitegeht und, [ashamed], deine Frau dich verlässt und plötzlich, [breaking], will niemand einen alten Narren einstellen.
573. [defiant] Stolz war alles, was mir noch blieb, nachdem, [voice shaking], ich zusehen musste, wie alles zusammenbrach, was ich aufgebaut hatte, während mein eigener Sohn, [accusatory], jede meiner Entscheidungen verurteilt hat. [laughs bitterly]
574. [softer] Vielleicht hast du ja recht mit dem Spielen, [regretful], aber was bringt es uns jetzt noch, recht zu haben?
575. [vulnerable] Ich sehe dich manchmal in den Nachrichten, wenn sie, [proud], dich über Altenpflege interviewen, und ich denke daran, wie, [wistful], erfolgreich du geworden bist, trotz mir als, [self-deprecating], Vater. [voice wavers]
576. [surprised] Du erinnerst dich daran? Ich dachte, du warst, [touched], zu jung, als sie starb, aber du erinnerst dich tatsächlich, [overwhelmed], wie ich ihr jeden, [choking up], Abend vorgelesen habe? [sniffles]
577. Der Mann, der seiner Mutter vorgelesen hat, ist noch, [searching], irgendwo hier drin, nur halt begraben unter Fehlern und Reue. [long pause]
578. [hesitant] Würdest du wirklich nochmal einen Versuch wagen mit, [ashamed], jemandem, der dich so vollkommen im Stich gelassen hat?
579. [grateful] Vielleicht könnten wir mit einem Kaffee anfangen, nachdem, [nervous], meine Schicht heute endet, falls du Zeit hast? [hopeful pause]
580. [crying] Danke, ähm, mein Junge, ich meine, ich verdiene diese zweite Chance nicht, aber, [determined], diesmal werde ich sie nicht verschwenden. [voice firm]
581. [slowly] Weißt du, ähm, als ich das erste Mal das Pitch Deck gesehen hab, dachte ich mir—ehrlich, schon wieder so ein Biotech-Startup, oder? [pause] Aber dann, äh, war da was an den Daten, das... ich meine, die präklinischen Ergebnisse waren echt der Wahnsinn. [excited] 23 Patienten mit ALS im Endstadium zeigen Verbesserungen der Motorik—das darf doch eigentlich gar nicht sein! Und ich sitze da und denke mir, okay also, das könnte echt was sein. [quietly] Das könnte tatsächlich was sein.

Die Sache ist, äh, ich hab, was, vielleicht 50 Deals im Healthcare-Bereich strukturiert? [sigh] Die meisten sind halt—weißte, marginale Verbesserungen, im Grunde Steueroptimierungen, die als Innovation verkauft werden. Aber dieser hier... [warming up] Ich weiß noch, wie ich den leitenden Forscher angerufen hab, so um, hm, 2 Uhr morgens, weil ich einfach nicht aufhören konnte, die Studiendaten zu lesen. [laugh] Meine Partner dachten, ich dreh durch—„ist doch nur ein weiterer Deal, beruhig dich mal."

[passionately] Aber es war eben nicht nur ein weiterer Deal! Wir reden hier von, ich meine, Kindern, die praktisch ein Todesurteil bekommen haben, und jetzt sind sie—[voice breaking] sorry, es ist nur... [short pause] Na ja, ähm, als wir letzte Woche die Finanzierungsrunde abgeschlossen haben, hat der Forscher tatsächlich geweint. [very quietly] Und ich ehrlich gesagt auch. [confidently] 40 Millionen Dollar, und zum ersten Mal weiß ich—ich weiß absolut sicher—dass das Geld genau da landet, wo es hingehört.
582. [excited] Sie rufen mich für den Preis auf, den—den Nationalen Aktivist des Jahres, kannst du das glauben? [pause] Gott, ich habe so hart dafür gearbeitet, so, 15 Jahre voller Kampagnen und Proteste und [proudly] tatsächliche Gesetze verändert. [short pause] Sarah sollte hier sein. [sad] Sie sollte—aber wir haben nicht mehr miteinander gesprochen seit, ähm, seit ich ihren Geburtstag für diese Konferenz verpasst habe. [regretful] Drittes Jahr in Folge, eigentlich. [clearing throat] Und Mama hat gestern angerufen, sagte sie erkennt mich nicht mehr wieder, [bitter] sagte ich würde mich mehr um Fremde kümmern als um meine eigene Familie. [defensive] Das ist nicht—ich meine, someone has to fight for these causes, oder? [shaky voice] Die Kinder denen ich helfe, they need someone who won't give up, jemanden der [passionately] alles der Veränderung widmet. [quietly] Alles. [long pause] Jake ist letzte Woche ausgezogen. [crying while speaking] Er sagte, he couldn't compete with my mission anymore, sagte er fühlte sich wie—wie ein Geist in seinem eigenen Zuhause. [sniffle] Sie verkünden jetzt meinen Namen, alle klatschen, und ich soll mich [hesitantly] stolz fühlen? Erfolgreich? [very sad] Ich habe so viele Familien gerettet, aber meine eigene konnte ich nicht retten. [exhausted] Was für eine Ironie, nicht wahr?
583. [gasp softly] Die haben tatsächlich—wir haben gewonnen. Ich meine, heilige Scheiße, wir haben tatsächlich gewonnen. [laugh] Drei Jahre, seit sie mich, ähm, gefeuert haben, weil ich „Sicherheitsbedenken geäußert" hatte, und jetzt—[bitter] jetzt müssen sie 8 Millionen Dollar zahlen, weil ich recht hatte. Der Defekt, vor dem ich sie ständig gewarnt hab, weißte, der hat 17 Menschen verletzt.

[pause]

Gott, ich weiß noch genau, wie ich in diesem Konferenzraum saß, während sie mir quasi gesagt haben, ich wäre „übertrieben besorgt". [angry] Tom saß da mit seinem blöden, selbstgefälligen Gesicht und meinte, ich würde das große Ganze nicht verstehen. Tja, [triumphant] wer versteht jetzt wohl das große Ganze, Tom?

[sigh]

Die Sache ist, äh, ich wollte gar nicht recht haben mit alldem. Diese Familien, die verletzt wurden—[very sad] ich meine, das ist nicht—genau das wollte ich doch verhindern. Aber sie wollten nicht hören, und ehrlich gesagt, [shaky voice] als das Urteil kam, war ich einfach...

[relieved] Es ist vorbei. Mein erster großer Fall, und er war gegen die Leute, die, äh, versucht haben, meine Karriere zu zerstören, nur weil ich das Richtige getan hab. [chuckle] Der Partner in meiner Kanzlei meinte, das wäre so was wie „poetische Gerechtigkeit", aber ehrlich? [exhausted] Ich bin einfach nur froh, dass diese Familien wenigstens was bekommen haben. Und vielleicht, [hopeful] vielleicht hören Unternehmen jetzt wirklich zu, wenn jemand Alarm schlägt.
584. [extremely happy] Ich hab's—ich hab's tatsächlich geschafft! Sarah fängt Montag an, sie ist, ähm, sie ist offiziell meine erste Angestellte. [chuckle] Mann, das klingt so komisch, wenn ich das laut sage, „meine Angestellte." [warm] Nach 30 Jahren, wo ich selbst Angestellter war, weißte, und jetzt bin ich—na ja, ich bin der Chef, schätze ich. [nervous] Die Sache ist, äh, als ich nach der Rente mit diesem kleinen Kerzengeschäft angefangen hab, sollte das eigentlich nur, ehrlich gesagt, was sein, um mich zu beschäftigen. [pause] Aber dann kamen immer mehr Bestellungen rein und ich konnte nicht—[overwhelmed] Ich meine, letzte Woche war ich bis 3 Uhr morgens am Wachs gießen und, äh, mein Rücken hat mich umgebracht. [laugh] Meine Frau meinte: „Entweder du stellst jemanden ein oder ich versteck deine Sachen!" [trailing off] Also hier sind wir und... [anxious] Was wenn ich das vermassle? Also, was wenn ich ein schrecklicher Chef bin oder, hmm, was wenn das Geschäft das gar nicht tragen kann—[short pause] Nein. [confidently] Weißte was? Sarah ist klasse, sie ist total begeistert von den Seifen und, ähm, der neuen Lavendel-Linie, die wir planen. [very sincerely] Das ist echt. Mein kleines Rentner-Projekt wird, na ja, es wird was Richtiges. [emotionally] Etwas, das ich aufgebaut hab. [sniffle] Tut mir leid, ich bin nur—[smiling speaking] wow. Wir machen das wirklich, ne?
585. Schau sie dir an. Einfach... [bitter] schau sie dir doch mal an, wie sie alles schreddern, als wär's nichts. [pause] Drei Kartons schon, und sie verstecken's nicht mal. Ich meine, [angry] das sind doch Menschenleben, die sie da zerstören—Krankenakten, Belästigungsbeschwerden, jahrelange Dokumentation. [shaky voice] Mein Anwalt sagt, wir hatten Glück, ähm, dass wir rechtzeitig eingereicht haben, aber das ist doch nicht—[frustrated] Gott, wie kann das überhaupt legal sein? [long pause] Sie verbrennen wortwörtlich Beweise im Innenhof. [disgusted] Am helllichten Tag, als ob sie halt irgendeine Party feiern. Ich hab gewonnen, [very quietly] ich hab meinen Fall gewonnen, hab alles bekommen, was ich verlangt habe, aber das hier mitanzusehen... [sigh] Sarah aus der Buchhaltung, die brauchte diese Stundenzettel für ihre Überstundenklage. [upset] Marcus hatte seine ganzen Unterlagen zur Diskriminierung wegen seiner Behinderung da drin—ich hab selbst gesehen, wie sein Ordner in den Schredder wanderte. [furious] Fünf Jahre hab ich denen gegeben, und das machen sie draus? Sie einigen sich mit mir und dann, [bitterly] dann sorgen sie dafür, dass niemand anders mehr was beweisen kann. [pause] Mein Scheck ist gestern eingegangen. 200.000. [very sad] Aber was ist mit all den anderen, die noch kämpfen? [whispering] Ich hätte sie irgendwie warnen sollen, ich hätte—[trailing off] Ich weiß auch nicht. [exhausted] Vielleicht sollte ich das filmen. Moment, [anxious] was wenn sie sehen, dass ich von hier aus zuschaue?
586. [extremely happy] I just signed the papers! Two years—two whole years of, like, eating ramen and skipping vacations, and it's actually happening. [shaky voice] My hands were literally shaking when I picked up the pen. You probably thought I was being dramatic, but um, this is everything I've been working toward. Remember when you first sat me down and showed me that spreadsheet? [laugh] I thought you were insane. "Save thirty percent of your income," you said, and I was like—there's no way. But you broke it down, week by week, and somehow... [warm] somehow you made it feel possible. 

[pause] I keep thinking about calling my mom. She never thought I'd—well, she always worried I'd be renting forever. [excited] But look at me now, right? An actual homeowner! With a porch and everything! [anxious] Oh God, what if something breaks though? Like, I don't even know how to fix a leaky faucet. That's—that's normal, right? Everyone feels this way? 

[very sincerely] I couldn't have done this without you. Seriously. Every time I wanted to give up, you'd send those little encouragement texts. "Keep going, you're closer than you think." [sniffle] Sorry, I'm getting all emotional. It's just... [extremely happy] I have a home. My own home.
587. The verdict came in this morning and, um, we won. Big settlement too—enough that Maria can actually get the surgery she needs, pay her bills, you know, start over. [relieved] God, she cried when I told her. [pause] But then I looked across the courtroom and saw Jake's face and I just—[regretful] I mean, twenty years of friendship, gone. Just like that. We used to have barbecues together, our kids played together, and now he won't even, like, look at me. [bitter] He texted me "congratulations" with a period. A fucking period. That's it. [sigh] And honestly, the thing is—I had to take this case, right? Maria couldn't walk after that accident, she lost her job, her whole life basically fell apart because his company cut corners on safety. [frustrated] What was I supposed to do, tell her sorry, I can't help because the CEO is my buddy? [quietly] But God, it hurts. [pause] I keep thinking about our golf trips, those stupid inside jokes we had. [very sad] I guess I always knew this job would cost me something eventually. [slowly] I just, er, never thought it would be him. [long pause] At least Maria gets justice. That has to be enough. [trailing off] It has to be...
588. [excited] Okay also, ähm, ich hab gerade die Zahlen durchgerechnet und—ehrlich, das ist unglaublich. Ich meine, beide Firmen waren ja praktisch am Ende, oder? DataSync hat Geld verbrannt, [slowly] so ungefähr, was waren es, acht Millionen pro Quartal? Und MicroVault hatte die Infrastruktur, aber, äh, absolut null Produktinnovation. [pause] Die Sache ist die, niemand sonst hat es gesehen, weil alle die Firmen einzeln betrachtet haben.

[warm] Aber hier wird's richtig genial—ich hab angefangen, deren Assets zu mappen und, weißt du, es ist wirklich wie zwei Puzzleteile. DataSync hatte diese brillanten KI-Algorithmen, aber keine Serverkapazität, und MicroVault hatte, hmm, all diese leeren Rechenzentren, die einfach ungenutzt rumstanden. [speeding up] Also hab ich die Synergiemodelle durchgerechnet und allein die Kosteneinsparungen wären, ich weiß nicht, 40 Millionen im ersten Jahr?

[relieved] Und der Vorstand hat tatsächlich zugehört. Also, die haben's echt verstanden, als ich ihnen gezeigt hab, dass sich die Kundenstämme nicht mal überschneiden—DataSync im Gesundheitswesen, MicroVault im Finanzsektor. [chuckle] Lustig ist ja, na ja, am Anfang hielten mich alle für verrückt. "Warum zwei gescheiterte Firmen fusionieren?", haben sie gesagt. [confidently] Aber das ist ja das Ding—sie sind nicht an denselben Sachen gescheitert. Zusammen sind sie, ähm, tatsächlich überlebensfähig. Verdammt, sie florieren jetzt sogar. [long pause] Manchmal sind die besten Deals halt die, die sonst keiner anfassen will.
589. Everyone thinks being the omega means, you know, being weak or whatever, but honestly that's not— [pause] that's not how it works at all. Like, yesterday when those wolves from the northern territory showed up? [anxious] Everyone was getting all aggressive and I could feel it, um, this tension building up that was about to explode into something really bad. And I just... [slowly] I stepped forward and did that thing I do, where I basically diffuse everything? 

[relieved] The alpha from their pack, he actually listened to me. I mean, nobody expects the omega to be the one negotiating, right? But that's the thing— [confidently] I can read the room better than anyone. I know when someone's about to snap, er, when pride is getting in the way of actual solutions. [warm] It's like I can feel what everyone needs to hear to back down without losing face.

So yeah, we avoided a full-on territorial war because I suggested, well, this compromise about the hunting grounds that literally nobody else thought of. [proud] Sometimes being the one who feels everything most intensely? [short pause] That's actually our pack's secret weapon. Everyone's so focused on, uh, strength and dominance, but empathy? [smiling speaking] That's what really keeps us safe.
590. [confidently] So here I am, right? Corner office, the whole thing. I mean, fifteen years of basically killing myself and I finally—[pause] I'm the one everyone reports to now. Kind of surreal, honestly. 

[bitter] You know what's funny though? I, uh, I tried calling Jake yesterday—my best friend since college—and he just... [trailing off] sent me straight to voicemail. Third time this month. And Sarah? [sad] She literally crossed the street when she saw me coming. Like, actually crossed the street to avoid me.

[regretful] I guess somewhere along the way I became that person, you know? The one who's always "too busy" for drinks, who cancels plans because of some emergency meeting that's not really an emergency. [sigh] And now it's like—here's the thing—I've got all these work friends who laugh at my jokes because they have to, who invite me to lunch because, well, I'm the boss now.

[very melancholic] But nobody calls me at 2 AM anymore when their life's falling apart. Nobody texts me stupid memes. [shaky voice] I mean, I won. Right? This is winning? [pause] Sitting here in my perfect office, eating lunch alone again, scrolling through old group chats where I'm just... [whispering] not invited anymore.
591. [exhausted] Heute Morgen haben sie 30 Leute entlassen. Dreißig. [pause] Und ich stehe einfach da an meiner Station, weißt du, denke mir, ich bin wahrscheinlich der Nächste, als—als der Notauftrag reinkommt. [anxious] 5000 Einheiten, Spezialwerkzeuge für diese Medizintechnikfirma, und ähm, sie brauchen sie perfekt. [bitter] Perfekt. Nachdem sie gerade unser Team halbiert haben.

[frustrated] Aber ich richte trotzdem meine Maschine ein, I mean, what else am I gonna do? [focused] Und ich fahre diese Schnitte und irgendwas macht einfach... klick. [excited] Jedes einzelne Teil, absolut präzise, also, wir reden hier von null-komma-null-null-eins Toleranz, [speeding up] und ich erreiche Geschwindigkeiten, die noch nie jemand auf dieser Anlage geschafft hat, und der Qualitätskontrolleur, [animated] der steht buchstäblich mit offenem Mund da, weil wir—[laugh] wir sind tatsächlich dem Zeitplan voraus!

[shaky voice] Der Kunde ruft an. Sagt, wenn wir das durchziehen, gibt's einen Zweijahresvertrag. [pause] Zwei Jahre. [very quietly] Dieselben Manager, die gerade unser halbes Department zerstört haben, [sarcastic] they're suddenly treating me like I'm the second coming. [sigh]

[sad] Ich hab ihnen den Arsch gerettet. Die Firma ist jetzt wahrscheinlich sicher, aber... [trailing off] diese 30 Leute sind trotzdem weg. [long pause] Ich sollte stolz sein, schätze ich, but honestly? [very melancholic] Ich fühle mich einfach nur leer.
592. [extremely happy] We did it! Oh my God, um, I just got the final numbers and—[gasp softly] twice what we expected. Actually twice! I mean, [relieved] when Sarah called me with the total, I honestly thought she'd made a mistake. Like, there's no way, right? But then she, uh, she read it again and [cheerful] it's real!

[pause] You know, I keep thinking about that little girl, Emma—the one with the, hmm, the butterfly drawings all over her IV pole? [empathetically] Her mom was crying when I told her about the new equipment we can buy now. Not just the basics we hoped for, but like, [animated] the specialty monitors, the comfort items, basically everything on our wish list!

[sniffle] Sorry, I'm just—God, it's been such a long year of planning this thing. And honestly, [hesitantly] there were moments where I thought, what if nobody shows up? What if we barely cover the catering costs? [laugh] But then tonight happened and, er, everyone was so generous. [warm] That moment during the auction when Mr. Peterson doubled his bid just because—[trailing off] I don't know, it's like the whole room understood what this meant. 

[very sincerely] These kids, they're gonna have everything they need now.
593. [relieved] Oh mein Gott, ich kann's nicht glauben, dass es wirklich vorbei ist. Also, als sie das Urteil verlesen haben und „nicht schuldig" gesagt haben, ich war einfach—[crying while speaking] Ich meine, achtzehn Monate hat der Mann in einer Zelle gesessen für etwas, was er nicht getan hat. Und die ganze Zeit hatte ich diese Information, aber ich hatte solche Angst, mich zu melden, weil, na ja, der echte Täter hat meine Familie bedroht, weißt du? [pause] Aber seine Mutter jeden einzelnen Tag im Gerichtssaal zu sehen, Marcus' Mutter, das hat mich... das hat mich fertiggemacht.

[anxious] Ich hab die ganze Zeit gedacht, was ist, wenn sie mir nicht glauben? Was ist, wenn meine Aussage nicht reicht? Ich hatte halt praktisch das ganze Leben dieses Mannes in meinen Händen. [shaky voice] Die Sache ist, als ich ihnen endlich erzählt hab, dass ich Derek an der Tankstelle gesehen hab—nicht Marcus—und ihnen die Quittung gezeigt hab, die ich aufbewahrt hatte, da hat ehrlich gesagt alles einfach Sinn ergeben.

[warm] Marcus hat mich danach umarmt. Dieser Mann, der, ähm, alles verloren hat—seinen Job, seinen Ruf—er hat sich tatsächlich bei MIR bedankt. Kannst du das glauben? [sniffle] Ich hätte früher was sagen sollen, wirklich, aber wenigstens... [trailing off]

[happy] Wenigstens geht er heute Abend nach Hause. Das ist doch das, was zählt, oder? Er geht endlich nach Hause.
594. Dreiundzwanzig Jahre. [very sad] Dreiundzwanzig Jahre hab ich in der Werkstatt an Schlitten gearbeitet. Und jetzt ist einfach... [pause] Ich meine, ich denke die ganze Zeit, ich werde aufwachen, weißt du? [shaky voice] Als ob das hier irgendein Albtraum wäre oder so.

Ich bin heute Morgen vorbeigefahren und, [gasp loudly] Gott, alles weg. Die Hebebühnen, die Diagnoseausrüstung, ähm, all die Arctic Cat Spezialwerkzeuge, die ich über die Jahre gesammelt hab. [bitter] Der alte Ski-Doo, den ich für den Murphy-Jungen restauriert hab—der alte Schlitten von seinem Vater aus den Siebzigern. [sigh] Das Ding war eigentlich fertig, ich musste nur noch—ist jetzt auch egal.

[angry] Ich bin so ein Idiot! Alle haben mir immer gesagt: „Jerry, schließ eine Versicherung ab, was ist, wenn mal was passiert?" Und ich dachte immer, na ja, ich war doch so lange vorsichtig, oder? [frustrated] Es ist doch nie was passiert, warum sollte also—Gott, ich kann nicht glauben, dass ich so dumm war. [cry] Achtunddreißigtausend Dollar hab ich für das neue Prüfstandsystem noch abzuzahlen gehabt. Hab ich immer noch, eigentlich.

[whispering] Die Werkzeuge von meinem Großvater waren da auch drin. [sniffle] Die, die er benutzt hat, als er die Werkstatt '61 aufgemacht hat. Die waren nicht nur, also—die sind halt unersetzlich. [very quietly] Mama wird am Boden zerstört sein, wenn ich's ihr sage.

[exhausted] Ich könnte wohl, äh, irgendwie nochmal von vorne anfangen? Vielleicht? [hesitantly] Aber ehrlich gesagt, ich bin vierundfünfzig Jahre alt und ich... [trailing off] Ich weiß nicht, ob ich die Kraft dazu noch hab.
595. Die haben... die haben mich einfach ins Büro bestellt und gesagt, es ist vorbei. [very quietly] Budgetkürzungen. Also, nach drei Jahren Überwachung der Korallenbleiche, jede einzelne Veränderung dokumentiert, und wir waren so kurz davor—ich mein, [frustrated] wir haben *wortwörtlich* letzte Woche erst diese Sache mit den Temperaturschwankungen entdeckt! Die Sache ist, ähm, Dr. Martinez hat ständig von "ungünstigem Timing" geredet und ich sitze da und denke mir, [bitter] ja, ungünstig für die Riffe, die sterben, während ihr eure Tabellen hin und her schiebt.

[pause]

Gott, ich weiß nicht mal—ehrlich, was soll ich denn jetzt machen? [very melancholic] All diese Tauchgänge im Morgengrauen, die Nächte mit Datenanalyse, bis mir die Augen gebrannt haben, und wofür? Damit sie, weißt du, die Mittel wahrscheinlich für irgendeinen Manager-Bonus umschichten können. [angry] Es geht nicht nur um meinen Job—es geht um die Oktopus-Aufzuchtstation, die wir aufgebaut haben, die Kelp-Renaturierung, die tatsächlich funktioniert hat!

[sigh]

Meine Mutter wird sagen, ich hätte in die Tech-Branche gehen sollen wie meine Schwester. [mumbling] "Meeresbiologie is' nich' stabil, Schatz." Ja gut, der Ozean anscheinend auch nicht, und irgendjemand muss doch—[trailing off]

[long pause]

Ich werd' dann wohl, äh... morgen meine Feldnotizen einpacken. [crying while speaking] Sieben Jahre Forschung. Einfach so.
596. [bitter] Sie machen wirklich den ganzen Laden dicht. Also, komplett alles, und anscheinend liegt's—na ja, sie haben praktisch gesagt, es lag an meinen Schaufenstern. [short pause] Ich meine, klar, vielleicht war das Fenster mit den Schaufensterpuppen ein bisschen avant-garde, aber ehrlich, woher sollte ich denn wissen, dass die Leute das „verstörend" finden würden? [defensive] Die Zentrale hat doch ständig gesagt „sei kreativ, geh Risiken ein", also hab ich's gemacht! Und dann plötzlich heißt es nur noch, ähm, „Warum haben Sie die so arrangiert?" und „Was haben Sie sich dabei gedacht?" [shaky voice] Ich hab eben mal um die Ecke gedacht, das war's.

[regretful] Mensch, ich hätte einfach... keine Ahnung, auf Nummer sicher gehen sollen? Den langweiligen Saisonkram machen, den alle erwarten? [sniffle] Aber nein, ich musste ja unbedingt—die Sache ist, ich dachte wirklich, ich mache was Besonderes. [sad] 23 Jahre war der Laden offen. 23 Jahre, und dann komme ich für sechs Monate und... [trailing off]

[exhausted] Mein Vertrag läuft Freitag aus. Sie lassen mich nicht mal, also, beim Räumungsverkauf helfen oder so. [mumbling] „Es ist besser, wenn Sie keine weiteren Schaufenster mehr gestalten", haben sie gesagt. [long pause] Ich denke ständig an all die Mitarbeiter, die ihren Job verlieren, weil ich, was, künstlerisch sein wollte? [very sad] Toller Visual Merchandiser bin ich geworden.
597. Sie haben mir gestern die Stelle angeboten. Maintenance supervisor. [pause] Und ich meine, das Timing ist einfach—na ja, es ist eigentlich perfekt, oder? [bitter] Perfekt auf die verkorksteste Art überhaupt. Ich werde jetzt jeden Tag da sein, einfach... kaputte Sachen reparieren während Sarah oben ist [trailing off]

[anxious] Die Sache ist, ähm, ich brauche die Versicherung, offensichtlich. Und die Arbeitszeiten, they're actually flexible enough that I can, weißt du, jederzeit hoch zur Onkologie. [very quietly] Zimmer 412. [clearing throat] Jedenfalls, HR war wirklich verständnisvoll wegen der ganzen Situation, was ja Sinn macht, weil sie schon wissen—ich meine, everyone knows at this point.

[frustrated] Aber hier ist was dir niemand sagt: Ich werde buchstäblich das Gebäude instand halten, wo meine Frau—[shaky voice] wo sie stirbt. Like, I'll be checking the HVAC in the room next to hers, oder, äh, Glühbirnen austauschen im Flur, wo wir die Diagnose bekommen haben. [sigh]

[warm] Sarah hat tatsächlich gelacht, als ich's ihr erzählt hab. Sie meinte, na wenigstens kannst du jetzt den quietschenden Rollstuhl auf der Chemostation reparieren. [crying while speaking] Gott, she's still trying to make me smile through all of this. [long pause]

[very slowly] Also ja, ich fange Montag an.
598. Oh my God. Oh my God, they said yes. They actually—[gasp softly] I can't even process this right now. Like, three point five million dollars. [very excited] Three point five MILLION! That's not, um, that's not a typo or anything, right? I mean, I kept expecting them to interrupt me during the pitch and just, you know, tear everything apart but they—they loved it. [laugh] They actually loved the platform architecture, and honestly, when I showed them the user acquisition numbers, I could literally see their eyes light up.

[relieved] God, all those nights practicing in front of the mirror, just... saying the same slides over and over until I was basically dreaming in pitch deck format. And that one part where I always stumbled—the financial projections—[cheerful] I nailed it! Like completely nailed it this time! 

[pause]

Wait, this means—oh shit, this means we can actually hire the dev team. [speeding up] We can get the office space, we can launch the beta properly, we can—[trailing off] I should probably call Mom. She's gonna... [extremely happy] she's gonna completely freak out! 

[whispering] We did it. We actually, really did it. This is happening.
599. [anxious] Okay, so, we've got a serious problem here. I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen years and I've never— [pause] The foundation is compromised. [formal] According to our structural assessment, there are multiple hairline fractures running through the load-bearing sections, and, um, the southeast corner has shifted approximately three inches. [worried] That's not supposed to happen.

[clearing throat] Look, I don't want to alarm anyone, but [very quietly] this is really, really bad. The concrete is basically crumbling in places where— [frustrated] God, how did it even get this bad without anyone noticing? [quickly] We're talking potential catastrophic failure here, like the whole building could—I mean, we need to evacuate. Now.

[shaky voice] I've already called the structural engineers, they're on their way, but honestly? [pause] This building shouldn't have anyone in it. [stern] I'm recommending immediate evacuation of all floors. The cracks, they're, uh, they're growing. [very loudly] We measured them this morning and they've expanded another millimeter just since lunch!

[apologetic] I know this is going to be a huge disruption, but [passionately] people's lives are at stake here! [hesitantly] The repair costs alone are going to be—well, that's not even the main concern right now. [urgent] We need everyone out within the hour, maybe less.
600. [cheerful] So I'm doing my usual route today, right? Just, you know, reading meters like always, and um, I'm behind the Johnsons' house when I hear this— [curious] this little meowing sound. And honestly, I'm thinking maybe it's nothing, but then [concerned] I see this orange tabby just huddled under their deck, and the thing is, it's wearing a collar. [empathetically] Poor thing looked so scared, I mean, really terrified. 

So anyway, I'm like— [hesitantly] should I even touch it? But then, uh, I remembered seeing those posters. [excited] Those kids! Those kids from two streets over! They'd been, like, putting up these handmade signs everywhere about their missing cat, Pumpkin or something. [warm] And I just thought about how devastated they must be, you know?

[determined] So I basically just scooped up the cat—it was actually pretty friendly once I got close—and err, walked straight to their house. [emotional] And when those kids opened the door and saw their cat... [pause] God, they just— [crying while speaking] they started crying and hugging the cat and then, like, they hugged me too? [laugh] Their mom was crying, I was getting all choked up. [relieved] It's just... sometimes this job, it's not just about reading meters, you know? [happy] Sometimes you actually get to, um, make someone's whole day.
601. The syringes and vials aren't, [quietly], what you think they are—they're part of something, [exhausted], much more complicated than stealing medication. [pause]
602. [gently] I am dying, have been for months, but that's, [resigned], not why I'm doing this—these treatments could save dozens of patients if I can just, [determined], prove they're safe by testing them on someone who's already, [trailing off], running out of time anyway.
603. [warm] Someone has to be first to try these experimental drugs and I'd rather it be, [bitter], someone who chose this path than a desperate patient who, [very quietly], thinks it's their only hope when we don't even know the side effects. [long pause]
604. The research team thinks these compounds are, [excited], promising but they need human trials which take years to approve while people are, [frustrated], dying right now in beds just down this hallway waiting for, [melancholic], miracles that might never come.
605. [monotone] Well, um, those stories aren't just fantasies anymore because I mean, I've been documenting every reaction and, you know, side effect in detailed journals that will help researchers understand these treatments better.
606. Six months of careful doses and meticulous notes while my body, [slowly], deteriorates but the data gets stronger. [cough]
607. [cheerful] Well, um, the third trial is showing real promise and, er, if my calculations are right, we could have, [animated], a breakthrough that changes how we treat lymphatic cancers, which means, I mean, my death might actually, [proudly], mean something.
608. [formal] The next injection happens in twenty minutes and you can either report me, [pleading], ending this research, or pretend you never saw anything. [deep breath]
609. [grateful] That would mean having a witness to either my, [fearful], greatest failure or most important contribution to medicine. [laugh]
610. Then stay and watch me save the world one, [peaceful], injection at a time while my body becomes the bridge between, [accepting], suffering and hope for patients I'll never, [very slowly], meet but desperately want to help.
611. [shocked] I can, um, actually see you standing there which, well, [shaky voice], shouldn't be possible but you know, [confused], here we are having this conversation about the complaints I've been investigating.
612. The files I've been, um, reviewing show patterns of medication errors and, [hesitantly], staffing shortages but, well, [anxious], nothing that explains why you're appearing to me now. [pause]
613. [determined] Every complaint letter mentioned the same nurse on duty during the, [quietly], unexpected deaths, but the administration kept, [frustrated], dismissing concerns as coincidence rather than investigating properly.
614. [whispering loudly] This is evidence.
615. I've been, er, investigating complaints for fifteen years but, um, [trembling], this is the first time the victims themselves have, well, [very melancholic], directly shown me what I needed to see.
616. [apologetic] The system failed you and everyone else who died here unnecessarily.
617. [confidently] I have enough now to bypass the local administration and take this directly to, [stern], federal investigators who can't be, [loudly], intimidated or bought off by the facility's owners.
618. [curious] So, um, you're telling me that, well, [excited], they kept evidence of their own crimes because, I mean, [whispering], they never expected anyone would look there? [cough]
619. [grateful] Your persistence even after death is going to, [emotionally], save lives and bring justice to families who've been, [very sincerely], grieving without answers for far too long. [deep sigh]
620. I promise you that by next week, [firmly], every relevant authority will have copies of this evidence and, [passionately], the investigation will be too public for anyone to, [determinedly], cover up or dismiss. [short pause]
621. [stunned] You're standing here in your, [disbelief], college clothes telling me you want to throw away everything I've, [breaking], worked for just to end up with broken hands and a, [hollow], bent back like mine?
622. [bitter] Um, you think there's honor in this? Well, there's just pain, [defeated], son—pain that starts in your shoulders and spreads everywhere else.
623. I didn't break my body for, um, thirty years so you could romanticize poverty and, [angry], physical labor—I did it so you'd never have to know what it, well, feels like.
624. [weary] Pride doesn't pay for surgery when your back gives out at, [heavy], fifty-two and you can't lift your grandchildren anymore.
625. [firm] What matters is you getting a degree that opens, [measured], doors I could never even knock on, son.
626. [exhausted] Um, you think I don't know that? I've been invisible my whole, [hollow], life, well, except to you and your mother.
627. [cracking] Well, son, um, heroic is a word for people in movies, not for, [choked], men who just show up because, uh, someone has to.
628. [whispered] Well, I can't.
629. [broken] Um, I can't watch you choose my life when I spent, [trembling], every hour of overtime trying to make sure you'd never, well, have to, when your mother and I dreamed you'd wear a tie, not, [defeated], steel-toed boots. [crying]
630. [resigned] Um, if you do this, well, if you really walk away from college to work these docks, [heavy], you better be damn sure, son.
631. [defensive] Look, everything we built was approved by, [frustrated], my contractors who assured me it was completely, [sharp], legal and wouldn't hurt anyone or, [dismissive], anything in the area.
632. [quiet] That can't be right.
633. I mean, we're providing wellness and, [uncertain], healing to thousands of people, um, surely there's a way to, well, balance everyone's needs here.
634. [softening] My brand is built on natural healing and, [struggling], connection to the earth—I never wanted to be someone who, [voice breaking], takes that away from others.
635. The investors are expecting a return of, [anxious], twelve million this quarter and if we reduce water usage, [desperate], the treatment pools and steam rooms would have to close. [exhales]
636. You're asking me to spend millions to, [reluctant], retrofit everything when my business is already struggling after the pandemic.
637. [wavering] Um, when I started this place, I mean, I wanted to create something beautiful that, [emotional], helped people heal, not something that, well, caused harm to others who needed healing too.
638. [yielding] Okay, um, show me these sustainable systems you're talking about because, well, maybe there's a way to make this right without, uh, losing everything I've built here.
639. I suppose if we marketed it as, [thoughtful], an indigenous partnership and ecological restoration project, well, the investors might see it as, [calculating], adding value rather than costing money, um, right?
640. [resolved] Let's meet with the tribal council tomorrow and, [determined], start making amends because my mother would be, [breaking], ashamed if she knew I'd become someone who took water from people who, [tearful], needed it. [sniffles]
641. [defensive] Well, I mean, everything needs to be, [anxious], catalogued and wrapped properly because, um, my mother would never forgive me if anything got, [trembling], damaged even though she's, you know, [voice breaking], not here to see it anymore.
642. [tense] These plates were from her wedding and each one has to be, [methodical], positioned exactly right with the tissue paper folded at, [obsessive], precise angles because that's how she taught me to, [shaky], preserve what matters.
643. [struggling] But if I don't do this right, um, if even one thing breaks or gets lost, well, then I've failed her one more time.
644. She used to say I spent so much time, [bitter], making sure everything was flawless that I, well, forgot to actually live in the moments and, um, now all I have left are these, [breaking], perfect empty rooms.
645. [quiet] That was the one time I let her teach me without, [nostalgic], correcting her measurements or insisting on following the recipe exactly.
646. I keep thinking if I do this perfectly enough, [desperate], somehow it will make up for all the visits I, um, postponed because work needed to be, [regretful], perfect first and now, well, there's no more time for, [crying], visits. [sobs]
647. [exhausted] Um, okay, I mean, okay.
648. [softening] She always said I was trying to live life like it was a, [sad], museum exhibit instead of a, [realizing], home and maybe she was, [accepting], right all along.
649. [vulnerable] Could you help me pack this cake plate without, [tearful], wrapping it perfectly because it deserves to remember the mess we made that day?
650. [relieved] Thank you for seeing what I, um, needed when all I could see were, [grateful], straight lines and right angles that, well, never quite added up to goodbye. [long pause]
651. The shop owner's, [stunned], reflection in the vinyl—those eyes are exactly like, [recognition dawning], your mother's were before she, [voice breaking], before everything fell apart.
652. Every single performance ended with me staring at, [heavy], an empty seat in the front row. [long pause]
653. [quietly] I sent money every month but, [ashamed], never had the courage to write a letter or, [regretful], pick up the phone. [sighs heavily]
654. [defeated] Well, um, the truth is, uh, conducting a hundred musicians felt, [drowning], easier than facing one child I'd failed so, umm, completely. [exhales]
655. [anguished] Every symphony I conducted was, [haunted], an apology you'd never hear—each movement a letter I was, [guilty], too cowardly to send directly to, [breaking down], you.
656. Because, um, I have terminal cancer and, uhh, I needed to see if maybe, you know, there was still, [faltering], time. [voice breaks]
657. [desperate] Time to learn who you, [pleading], became without me—this incredible person who built something beautiful from, [sobbing], all the wreckage I left, [voice failing], behind. [crying]
658. [crushed] Then I'm twenty years and, [destroyed], one death too late. [silence]
659. [broken] May I, [tentative], buy it?
660. [whispered] Thank, [grateful], you. [crying softly]
661. [extremely happy] Oh my God, I literally cannot believe what just happened this week! So, um, you know how I hired that new visual merchandiser? Well, honestly, I was a bit skeptical at first because, like, they had all these wild ideas and I'm thinking—[hesitantly] okay, sure, whatever, let's just see what happens, right? 

But then, err, Monday morning comes and they've completely transformed the window. I mean, [gasp loudly] there were actual people stopping on the sidewalk! Like, not just glancing—actually stopping, taking photos, calling their friends over. [laugh] The thing is, uh, I've never seen anything like it in the fifteen years I've owned this place.

[speeding up] And the sales numbers, oh my God, the sales numbers! We're talking triple—TRIPLE—what we normally do. Actually, no wait, [pause] let me check again because I keep thinking I'm reading it wrong. [whispering] Yeah, it's really triple. 

[warm] You know what though? I should have trusted them from the start. They kept saying, "Just wait, you'll see," and I was all—[mocking] yeah yeah, sure, we'll see. But honestly, they were so right. I'm just—[sigh] I don't know, I'm kind of emotional about it? Because this could really change everything for us. [cheerful] I already texted them a huge thank you, but tomorrow, they're getting the biggest bonus I can manage!
662. [quietly] Um, I know.
663. [hesitantly] Well, um, the climate models show, [bitter], catastrophic flooding within eighteen months, and I mean, [trembling], we can't ignore that data anymore.
664. [shocked] Um, I didn't know you, like, worked here when they assigned me this, [empathetically], evaluation, and now I'm supposed to be, [professional], objective about destroying your livelihood, you know?
665. [regretful] The waters are rising faster than anyone, [very quietly], predicted when we were kids playing by that creek. [sigh]
666. [warm] I mean, um, I heard through cousins but didn't know if, [sad], you'd want me there after everything that, [whispering], happened between us.
667. [apologetic] My job is protecting people from climate disasters but I couldn't, [passionately], protect our family from falling apart.
668. [defensive] Someone had to understand why these disasters keep, [quickly], happening to working families like ours.
669. [determined] Well, um, there might be a way to, [carefully], relocate the facility to higher ground if, er, [hopefully], we work together on the proposal, you know? [long pause]
670. [confidently] Um, I mean, I've already started drafting emergency funding applications that could, [excited], cover seventy percent of moving costs.
671. Every flood zone I assess has families like ours who, [melancholic], never saw it coming until the water was already, [chuckle], at their door and by then, [whispering loudly], it's too late.
672. [exhausted] Ich hab, ähh, eigentlich noch gar nicht geschlafen, if I'm being, [honest], completely truthful with you, und ich weiß wirklich nicht mehr, [trailing off], wann ich das letzte Mal...
673. Die Mission lief schief und, [regretful], wir haben 3 gute Leute da draußen in diesen gottverlassenen Bergen verloren.
674. [bitter] Ja, nun, diesmal war es anders, weil, [shaky voice], ich sollte sie beschützen und durchführen.
675. [surprised] Deine Tochter ist beim 42. Bataillon, [recognizing], because that's exactly where we were heading before everything fell apart.
676. [quickly] Nein nein, ähm, ihr geht's gut, es geht ihr absolut gut, äh, ich hab sie letzte Woche getroffen, als wir, ähh, Vorräte am Stützpunkt geholt haben.
677. [sincerely] Sie hat mir tatsächlich, ähm, Ratschläge über das Gelände gegeben, die wahrscheinlich, [grateful], mehr Leben gerettet haben als wir verloren, und ich meine, [quietly], she really knows what she's doing out there. [sigh]
678. [thoughtful] Weißt du was, ich hab mich fertig gemacht, [frustrated], wegen dieser 3 Soldaten, but talking to you makes me realize that, [slowly], wir alle tun, was wir können mit dem, was wir wissen.
679. Ich hab nicht wirklich, nun ja, niemanden der auf mich wartet, [melancholic], aber irgendwie hat dieses Gespräch die Reise weniger leer gemacht.
680. [grateful] Ähm, danke dafür, fürs, ähh, Zuhören ohne Urteil, als ich wirklich, [emotional], jemanden brauchte, der einfach versteht, wie es da draußen ist.
681. Würdest du, ähm, etwas dagegen haben, wenn ich deiner Tochter schreibe, nur um, [hopeful], ihr zu sagen, dass es ihrem Vater hier gut geht, und vielleicht, äh, [smiling speaking], tell her about this unexpected kindness I found at dawn? [deep breath]
682. [suspicious] Die Berichte, die ich vor 6 Monaten abgezeichnet habe, [shaky voice], wurden nach der Einreichung auf mysteriöse Weise geändert, und jetzt zeigen sie, [bitter], völlig andere Bodenverdichtungswerte.
683. [hesitantly] Also, ich meine, das ist nicht nur eine Behauptung—ich habe, ähm, die Originaldateien gespeichert, [whispering], auf meiner privaten Festplatte, und sie sind, äh, komplett anders als das, was, [frustrated], jetzt für die Fundamentarbeiten verwendet wird.
684. [defensively] Ich mache immer Sicherungskopien, weil, na ja, wissen Sie, ich habe schon erlebt, wie Kollegen, [angry], als Sündenbock hingestellt wurden, wenn Projekte scheiterten, und, ähm, ich musste mich, [trailing off], vor genau so einer Situation schützen...
685. [powerless] Aber ich, ähm, ich habe die geänderten Berichte auch unterschrieben, weil mein Vorgesetzter sagte, es seien, [confused], ‚kleinere Korrekturen' nötig.
686. [desperately] Die haben meine Unterschrift auf betrügerischen Dokumenten, [crying while speaking], und wenn das Gebäude einstürzt, weil der Boden es nicht tragen kann, [gasps], könnten Menschen sterben!
687. [bitterly] Ähm, klar. [sighs]
688. [monotone] Mein Chef hat mich gestern in sein Büro gerufen und gefragt, ob ich, [nervous], ‚Projektdetails mit jemandem außerhalb des Teams besprochen' hätte.
689. [resigned] 3 andere Ingenieure wurden bereits wegen, [sarcastic], ‚Leistungsproblemen' entlassen, nachdem sie Bedenken zu verschiedenen Projekten geäußert hatten. [groans]
690. [exhausted] Also, ähm, was passiert jetzt mit mir—ich meine, selbst wenn wir gewinnen, [defeated], ist mein Ruf in dieser Branche praktisch ruiniert, oder?
691. [quietly] Ich wollte doch nur Dinge bauen, die sicher sind und, [sadly], niemandem schaden würden. [sniffles]
692. [warm] Oh, ich, ähm, nehme die Umgebungsgeräusche auf, [gently], wie Stimmen durch diese alten Wände hallen, wie die, [slowly], Rohre morgens singen, und na ja, die Schritte, die diese Treppen über Jahrzehnte glatt gelaufen haben. [pause]
693. [quietly] Na ja, ähm, das ist die Sache.
694. Die Dokumentation muss alles erfassen, bevor, [regretful], der Abriss nächsten Monat beginnt, weshalb ich, [shaky voice], versuche, jedes Knarren und Flüstern zu bewahren. [sigh]
695. Oh Gott, Sie wissen es wirklich noch nicht, ähm, nicht, und ich dachte, [apologetic], alle wären schon vor Wochen benachrichtigt worden, aber anscheinend hat der, [very quietly], Vermieter die Mitteilungen noch nicht verschickt, was bedeutet, dass ich, tja, [bitter], Ihnen gerade den Morgen ruiniert habe. [gasp softly]
696. [tender] Hören Sie, ähm, ich weiß, das ist eine niederschmetternde Nachricht, und na ja, [understanding], vielleicht liegt etwas Schönes darin, dass, [monotone], diese Geräusche, die Schritte Ihrer Familie, in dieser Dokumentation für immer weiterleben werden, verstehen Sie?
697. Diese Aufnahmen werden aber, [sincerely], mehr als nur Geräusche bewahren.
698. [delighted] Tatsächlich, ähm, das wäre unglaublich, weil, halt, [animated], persönliche Erzählungen genau das sind, was dieses Projekt braucht, und na ja, [cheerful], Ihre 20 Jahre hier würden so viel Tiefe verleihen.
699. [professionally] Ähm, lassen Sie mich erst die Pegel einstellen, und, äh, [focused], dann können wir Ihre Stimme in genau dem akustischen Raum aufnehmen, wo diese Erinnerungen entstanden sind, verstehen Sie?
700. Diese geschärfte Wahrnehmung ist genau das, was ich erlebe, [thoughtfully], wenn ich weiß, dass eine Klanglandschaft gleich, [sadly], für immer verschwinden wird, als würde das Gebäude selbst, [softly], Abschied nehmen. [deep breath]
701. [inspired] Wir werden sicherstellen, dass jeder, der das hört, [passionate], versteht, dass dies nicht nur Beton und Stahl war, sondern, [warmly], ein Ort, wo echte Menschen ihre, [meaningfully], ganzen Welten aufgebaut haben.
702. [confused] Sie kennen mich? [pause]
703. [slowly] Der Geruch der Tinte hier ist, ähm, [whispering], irgendwie vertraut, als ob ich diesen Ort kennen sollte, aber, na ja, [trailing off], die Erinnerungen entgleiten mir immer wieder wie Wasser durch die Finger.
704. Manchmal träume ich von Maschinen, die, [bitter], für mich singen, aber ich kann mich nicht erinnern, ob sie wirklich existiert haben.
705. Da ist etwas an Ihren Händen, ähm, wie sie sich über das Metall bewegen, na ja, [sad], es fühlt sich an wie eine Erinnerung zu beobachten, die ich nicht ganz greifen kann.
706. [formal] Die junge Frau, die diese Werkstatt führt, muss, [clearing throat], sehr talentiert sein, um solch schöne Maschinen zu pflegen, obwohl ich mir wünschte, ich könnte mich, [mumbling], erinnern, wer sie so gut ausgebildet hat. [sigh]
707. Fünf Jahre klingt nach, ähm, einer langen Zeit, um etwas zu lernen, aber ich meine, [exhausted], mein Geist fühlt sich an, als hätte er jahrzehntelang geschlafen, und, na ja, [very melancholic], vielleicht hat er das auch.
708. [curious] Würden Sie mir beibringen, wie man, [enunciating every word], diese wunderschönen Maschinen bedient?
709. [happy] Das klingt schön.
710. [sleepily] Ich erinnere mich vielleicht nicht daran, Sie unterrichtet zu haben, aber Ihnen bei der Arbeit zuzusehen fühlt sich an wie, [stuttering], ein Stück meiner Seele zu sehen, von dem ich nicht wusste, dass es, [gasp softly], fehlte. [cough]
711. [whispering] Okay, ähm, fangen wir an.
712. [shocked] Äh, warte, was?
713. [hesitantly] Dein Vater war der anonyme Künstler hinter der, [very quietly], Einsamkeits-Serie, die in den letzten, [trembling], zehn Jahren den zeitgenössischen abstrakten Expressionismus revolutioniert hat? [gasp softly]
714. [anxious] Also, ähm, diese Gemälde sind, halt, kulturell bedeutende Werke, die in, [passionate], öffentliche Sammlungen gehören, nicht in irgendeinen, ähm, [pleading], Portfolio-Ausverkauf eines Risikokapitalgebers. [sigh]
715. [stern] Du redest davon, das, [shaky voice], Vermächtnis deines Vaters zu zerstören, indem du Werke zerstreust, die als, [empathetically], gemeinsame Meditation über Isolation und menschliche, [fragile], Verbindung erfahren werden sollten. [long pause]
716. [gently] Ich habe fünf Jahre lang jeden Pinselstrich studiert, den er je, [warm], gemacht hat, ohne seinen Namen zu kennen.
717. Das dritte Bild der Serie zeigt eine Figur, die durch die, [careful], Dunkelheit nach etwas greift, das gerade außerhalb des Bildausschnitts liegt, und ich habe mich immer gefragt, wonach sie, [curious], greift, bis ich jetzt erkenne, dass es vielleicht, [regretful], du warst. [pause]
718. [firmly] Also, ich habe seine Tagebücher aus dem Nachlass und, ähm, in jedem Eintrag erwähnt er einen Sohn, mit dem er nicht mehr, [emotionally], reden konnte, weißt du? [clearing throat]
719. [conciliatory] Vielleicht, ähm, waren die Gemälde ja seine Art, halt, [slowly], alles zu sagen, was er nicht laut aussprechen konnte, und, na ja, [hopeful], vielleicht bedeutet, sie zusammenzuhalten, seine, ähm, [trailing off], Entschuldigung intakt zu lassen... [short pause]
720. Was wäre, wenn das Museum sie erwirbt, aber, halt, [nervously], dich als Berater einbindet, damit du, ähm, [earnest], herausfinden kannst, wer er wirklich war, und trotzdem die finanzielle Unterstützung bekommst, die du, na ja, brauchst?
721. [sincerely] Ich meine, dir Zeit zu geben zu entscheiden, ob du die, [compassionate], Gemälde deines Vaters verkaufst oder deine letzte Chance, ihn durch die einzige Sprache, [very gently], kennenzulernen, die er offenbar, [whispered], fließend beherrschte. [gasp]
722. [condescending] Das kleine, [dismissive], pharmazeutische Unternehmen Ihres Vaters war einfach ein weiteres Opfer von, [coldly], Marktkräften, an die er sich nicht anpassen konnte—nothing personal about business decisions. [sigh]
723. Ähm, so funktioniert der Kapitalismus, wissen Sie—ich sah eine Gelegenheit und, [stern], ergriff sie, während Ihr Vater zu, [formal], sentimental war, um zu verstehen, dass Medizin, [mocking], eine Industrie wie jede andere ist, meine ich.
724. [demanding] Hören Sie, äh, ich brauche heute mein Herzmedikament, also, [impatient], whatever grudge you're harboring from ancient history, das muss, [clearing throat], beiseite gelegt werden, während Sie hier Ihre, ähm, Arbeit machen.
725. [defensive] Ähm, ich habe ein Imperium aufgebaut, das Tausende beschäftigte und, [proudly], I created shareholder value that funded retirements, und, [confident], Hochschulausbildungen im ganzen Land, äh, also ersparen Sie mir Ihre, ich meine, moralische Überlegenheit. [laugh]
726. [cold] Nun ja, ähm, Schwäche überlebt nicht in der, [harsh], realen Welt, wissen Sie.
727. [overly polite] Das waren einfach Geschäfte, [regretful], dokumentiert in Büchern und Verträgen. [cough]
728. [tired] Die Welt läuft nicht mit, [cynical], guten Absichten—it runs on profit margins, und, [monotone], Quartalsberichten.
729. Diese Art zu denken ist genau der Grund, warum das, [harsh], Unternehmen Ihres Vaters scheiterte, während meines, [triumphant], jahrzehntelang florierte, bis mein, [trailing off], Herz anfing zu versagen. [long pause]
730. [exhausted] Füllen Sie einfach das Rezept aus.
731. [resigned] Wissen Sie, äh, wie ich hier in dieser kleinen Apotheke sitze, [vulnerable], beginne ich zu sehen, dass das, [whispering loudly], Vermächtnis Ihres Vaters tatsächlich durch Sie überlebt hat, während meines, ähm, just numbers in accounts I can't take with me ist. [deep pitch]
732. [bitter] Well, um, not everyone gets to, [frustrated], become an overnight sensation with their first, [jealous], gallery show, you know, some of us are still grinding it out here.
733. [coldly] Right, well, luck or not, um, you're giving keynotes now while I'm still, [sad], doing concept art for mobile games that never ship, so...
734. [quietly] Imagination doesn't pay rent though, does it, and watching you on magazine covers while I'm, [melancholic], still here in this cramped space we used to dream in together, [voice breaking], it's just hard to not feel like I'm, [trailing off], disappearing somehow...
735. [tearfully] You don't have to say that just to, um, make me feel better, I mean, [shaky voice], we both know the market decided who matters and, uh, who doesn't. [sniffle]
736. [shocked] Wait, what, I mean, are you serious right now because, um, this feels like, [confused], charity and I don't need your, [proudly], pity job offer just because we used to be friends, you know, I still have my dignity here.
737. The thing is, I've been rejected so many, [defeated], times that I don't even know if I can, [trembling], trust good news anymore, like what if I'm not, [very softly], good enough for your fancy new world?
738. [crying while speaking] God, I hate this.
739. [vulnerably] You really think my weird fantasy stuff could, um, work for whatever you're planning because, I mean, [cautiously], I haven't changed my style despite everyone telling me to be more, [bitterly], commercial, and honestly I don't think I can change it now even if I wanted to.
740. [slowly] Integrity doesn't feel like much when you're thirty and your parents still ask when you're getting, um, a real job, but hearing you say that, [gratefully], seeing you actually value what I refused to give up, well, [choking up], maybe I haven't been completely foolish all these years. [cry]
741. [relieved] Okay, yes, I'll do it, but only if, um, you promise this is because you actually want my work, not because, well, [hopefully], you feel sorry for the girl who got left behind, because I need this to be, [desperately], real, you know?
742. Naja, ich verbringe viel zu viel Zeit, weißt du, damit nachzudenken—die ganze Idee, dass Realität vielleicht, äh, computational ist, that really messes with my head sometimes.
743. Das ist ja die Sache—wir würden nur, im Grunde, Glitches bemerken, wenn die Programmierer, hmm, es wollen würden. Like how video game characters don't know they're in a game, verstehst du?
744. Oh Mann, fang gar nicht erst mit Quantenmechanik an und wie Partikel sich anders verhalten wenn beobachtet—that's suspiciously like rendering optimization in games.
745. Ich weiß nicht ob, äh, glauben das richtige Wort ist, aber die Mathematik ist, eigentlich, überzeugend. Some physicists estimate there's like a billion-to-one chance we're in base reality.
746. Nick Bostroms Simulationsargument—basically if advanced civilizations can create simulations, würden sie Millionen davon erschaffen, also statistisch sind wir wahrscheinlich in einer.
747. Stimmt's? Und hier ist was, ähm, mir wirklich den Kopf verdreht—wenn wir simuliert sind, könnten die Wesen die es betreiben auch, naja, simuliert sein, like infinite nested realities.
748. Genau! It's turtles all the way down, aber, weißt du, mit Computern. Obwohl ehrlich gesagt, es ändert nicht wirklich, irgendwie, wie wir unser Leben leben sollten.
749. Because simulated or not, deine Erfahrungen sind, ähm, real für dich—deine Freude, im Grunde, dein Schmerz, deine Beziehungen. Das Substrat macht die Erfahrung selbst nicht ungültig.
750. Sorry, ich werde, so, richtig mechanisch wenn ich über dieses Zeug diskutiere, but anyway, it's fascinating how these ideas make us question the nature of consciousness itself.
751. Stimmt! Manchmal muss ich mich davon abhalten, um 3 Uhr morgens in diese Kaninchenlöcher zu fallen, or I'll never sleep again.
752. Noch nicht! Ich bin total versunken in dieser Serie namens Saga. Hast du sie gelesen? It's this wild space opera with bounty hunters and star-crossed lovers from warring species.
753. Genau! Jedes Mal wenn diese blaue Katze "LYING" sagt, muss ich lachen. Brian K. Vaughan schreibt so natürliche und witzige Dialoge, but then he'll hit you with these devastating emotional moments out of nowhere.
754. Oh Gott, ähm, fang gar nicht erst damit an, basically, I had to put the book down and walk around my apartment for 10 minutes.
755. Ja! Es ist äh, komplett anders aber, weißt du, equally brilliant, so wie Stranger Things meets Zeitreise, aber geschrieben bevor Stranger Things überhaupt existierte.
756. Jonathan Hickmans Sachen sind dicht, aber so lohnend, wenn man sich mal reingearbeitet hat. The world-building in East of West is insane - es ist diese alternative Geschichte, wo der Bürgerkrieg anders endete und die 4 Reiter versuchen die Welt zu beenden.
757. [gasp] Warte, ähh, hast du seine Black Monday Murders gelesen? Die Sache ist, it's basically occult noir about banking conspiracies and it's absolutely mind-blowing.
758. Das macht es ja genial! Er nimmt dieses trockene Thema und verwandelt es in diesen dunklen mystischen Thriller. The art by Tomm Coker is all shadows and sharp angles, perfect for the tone.
759. Oh Mann, also, deine Strichmännchen-Superhelden-Saga war, denke ich, legendary in its own way, wir zitieren Captain Rectangle manchmal immer noch!
760. Die Ausführung [very loudly] brauchte mehr als nur Arbeit, also wirklich, but I really admired your commitment to that weekly schedule you kept up for 2 whole months!
761. Absolut, ah, Marjorie Lius Schreibstil kombiniert mit Sana Takedas Kunst ist Perfektion, es ist nur so dass, every panel looks like it should be framed and hung in a gallery.
762. I hear your frustration, and you're right that we have serious issues here. But maybe advancing technology for lunar bases could actually help solve Earth's problems too, like developing better solar panels or water recycling systems?
763. I understand why it seems that way. The budget numbers are staggering, aren't they? But consider that NASA's entire annual budget is less than what Americans spend on pizza each year.
764. You're absolutely right to be [whispering] angry about healthcare access. That's a real injustice. What if I told you that space research has led to over 2,000 medical innovations including CAT scans and water purification systems?
765. That's a fair point, and maybe some would have. But the unique challenges of space force us to think differently. The artificial heart pump was directly inspired by space shuttle fuel pumps, saving thousands of lives.
766. Nobody's abandoning [shouting] Earth! Sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice. The scientists working on lunar bases are the same ones developing carbon capture technology and renewable energy solutions.
767. I see where you're coming from. But diverse research often leads to unexpected breakthroughs. The team developing lunar habitats just created a new type of concrete that actually absorbs CO2 instead of producing it.
768. So, you're not wrong that actually many experiments fail, the thing is, that's how science works. But when we succeed, the payoff is enormous for everyone, especially for developing nations who can leapfrog older technologies.
769. Absolutely true. And the water recycling [chuckle] system on the ISS, which would be used in lunar bases, is now being deployed in water-scarce regions worldwide. It can turn any water source into drinking water.
770. Fair enough.
771. Ah, you're completely right that priorities matter, right so, what if we viewed it as parallel development, it's just that both Earth and space research can happen together, making each other stronger?
772. That's a pretty common reaction, and I get why it might look that way from the outside. But conceptual artists often spend years developing their ideas and theoretical frameworks, which is its own kind of skill.
773. Oh yeah, Maurizio Cattelan's piece! Um, I know it seems absurd, but you know, the banana was actually questioning the entire art market system and how we assign value to things, which is pretty clever.
774. Your toddler sounds creative! But here's the difference: Cattelan wasn't just taping a banana, he was creating a commentary on commodity, decay, and the absurdity of art valuation itself.
775. Honestly, I used to think the same way, uh, but conceptual art is kind of like philosophy made visible. It asks questions rather than providing pretty pictures, challenging how we think about art itself.
776. Not everyone has to [stern] like it or buy it! Art markets are weird and inflated. But dismissing the entire movement ignores how it's shaped everything from advertising to social media.
777. Ah, that's a real issue, basically, and [cough] the thing is, most conceptual artists are struggling too. Only a tiny fraction make those headline-grabbing sales, while thousands work day jobs to support their practice.
778. Because the ideas [cry] matter even when the market is messed up! Duchamp's urinal changed how we think about authorship, context, and what makes something art versus not-art.
779. Ha! Here's the thing, though, [laugh] Duchamp would probably agree with you! That was his whole point, showing how context and intention transform objects, which was revolutionary in 1917.
780. Hmmm, think about it this way, anyway, every meme, every remix, pretty much all contemporary culture comes from this idea that context changes meaning.
781. True! But, uh, here's what's interesting, honestly, I think conceptual art democratized creativity, you see, by showing that ideas matter more than technical skill, making art accessible to everyone.
782. Oh Mann, fang [hesitantly] gar nicht erst an! Wenn wir draußen auf dem Wasser sind, sind wir auf Internetverbindungen angewiesen für Wetterupdates und Notfallkommunikation. If ISPs start throttling certain services, das könnte buchstäblich unsere Rettungseinsätze beeinflussen.
783. Genau? Also, die meisten Leute denken, es geht nur um, äh, Netflix-Geschwindigkeiten, aber eigentlich nutzen wir cloudbasierte Navigationssysteme und Echtzeit-Datenfeeds. Without net neutrality, ISPs could basically hold our operational efficiency hostage.
784. Absolut! Letzten Monat hatten wir eine Situation, wo wir Drohnen-Footage streamen mussten, um ein Suchmuster zu koordinieren. Stell dir vor, unser ISP hätte entschieden, dass dieser Videodienst nicht in ihrem "Fast-Lane"-Paket ist.
785. Siehst du, das ist die Sache - sie sagen, sie würden es nicht, aber ohne Regulierungen, was hält sie davon ab? We've already seen ISPs throttle firefighters' data during California wildfires because they hit data caps.
786. Verizon hat genau das 2018 gemacht! Die Feuerwehr musste das Doppelte zahlen, um ihre Geschwindigkeiten wiederherzustellen, während sie aktiv Feuer bekämpften. That's why this isn't just some abstract tech policy debate.
787. Klar, Netzwerkmanagement ist real, aber es gibt einen riesigen Unterschied zwischen vernünftigem Management und künstlicher Verknappung, um mehr Geld aus Leuten rauszuquetschen. Es ist, als würde ich bestimmte Boote von öffentlichen Wasserwegen blockieren, unless they paid extra.
788. Danke! Weißt du, hier draußen [cheerful] auf dem Wasser verstehen wir gemeinsame Ressourcen. Der Ozean gehört niemandem, and neither should the internet highways that we all depend on.
789. Oh, sie haben sie gebaut, aber [excited] mit massiven Steuergeldern! Wir haben Telekom-Unternehmen über 400 Milliarden Dollar gegeben, um Glasfasernetze zu bauen, und sie sollten dem öffentlichen Interesse dienen, nicht digitale Mautstraßen erschaffen.
790. Genau! Und hier ist die Sache, im Grunde, wenn ich mit, äh, anderen Behörden während einer Rettung koordiniere, brauchen wir gleichen Zugang zu allen Diensten. Können nicht haben, dass unsere Notfallkartierung langsam läuft, because we didn't pay for the premium tier, stimmt's?
791. Leben, Unternehmen, Bildung, Innovation - es hängt alles von, äh, gleichem Zugang ab, verstehst du. The internet's basically like navigable waters now, und ehrlich gesagt, es braucht die gleiche Art von Schutz.
792. Yeah, I've been trying to write everything [cough] down before I forget it all. She knew exactly when to plant based on bird migrations and moon phases, never needed a calendar or weather app.
793. It worked for generations before us, and honestly, her harvests were always better than the neighbors who used modern methods. The knowledge is so intricate though - like knowing which insects mean rain is coming three days out.
794. Well, I try to, sort of, but I'm losing pieces of it, actually. Yesterday I couldn't remember which bird call meant frost was coming, and that's knowledge that took decades for her to accumulate.
795. It's uhh, [slowly] overwhelming, basically. Every conversation we had contained layers of wisdom about soil health, companion planting, natural pest control - and I only retained fragments of it all.
796. She learned it all orally from her mother and grandmother, passed down through stories and hands-on teaching. Writing it down feels like translating poetry into spreadsheet cells - something essential gets lost.
797. I've started doing audio recordings, which helps [relieved] capture some of the context. But even then, so much was about reading the land itself - the feel of soil between your fingers, the smell of rain coming.
798. Exactly right. She could tell if soil was ready by how it crumbled, predict yields by the color of leaves in spring. These aren't things you can easily document in words or pictures.
799. Hmm, we lose more than techniques - we lose [chuckle] entire worldviews, kind of. Her approach saw the farm as a living system, not a production unit, and that perspective shaped everything from pest management to harvest timing.
800. The thing is, they want to learn, but, you see, they're growing up in a different world, ah. They understand apps better than apple trees, and I'm running out of energy to bridge that gap properly.
801. It's crushing sometimes, knowing I'm the last link to centuries of accumulated wisdom. Every day I forget something else, another remedy or planting rhythm, and it's just gone forever.
802. Wir sind im Grunde auf Flutter umgestiegen für [deep pitch] neue Features, äh, nachdem wir die Performance-Metriken verglichen haben. Allein die Hot-Reload-Funktion spart uns täglich Stunden, und Darts Type Safety fängt Fehler ab, die JavaScript in React Native Builds übersehen würde.
803. Nicht mehr – Flutter Web ist seit 2021 deutlich ausgereifter geworden, und wir haben Produktions-Apps damit laufen. Google Ads und Alibaba nutzen es beide extensiv, wobei die Bundle-Größen bei den initialen Ladezeiten noch problematisch sein können.
804. Also, KMM ist tatsächlich interessant für Teams, die bereits Android Studio nutzen, irgendwie. JetBrains pusht das stark, und Netflix hat es für ihr Prodicle-Projekt übernommen, teilen Business-Logic zwischen iOS und Android, während sie native UI-Layer behalten.
805. Microsoft verlagert den Fokus jetzt so auf MAUI, hmm, was schon Sinn macht. Xamarin.Forms-Apps werden migriert, aber ehrlich gesagt fühlt sich das Tooling immer noch klobig an im Vergleich zu dem, was Flutter oder sogar Ionic heutzutage bietet.
806. Die Sache ist die, Ionic mit Capacitor ist äh, überraschend beliebt für Enterprise-Apps, verstehst du. Firmen wie McDonald's und Southwest Airlines nutzen es, weil sie vorhandene Angular- oder React-Entwickler einsetzen können, ohne sie auf neue Frameworks schulen zu müssen.
807. Es ist halt so, dass die Performance vom Anwendungsfall abhängt, ähm, nicht vom Framework selbst, hmmm. Instagram läuft flüssig mit React Native, Reflectly nutzt Flutter wunderschön, und BMWs App verwendet Ionic ohne merkbare Verzögerungen – die Implementierung ist wichtiger als die Technologiewahl.
808. iOS, Android und Progressive Web Apps hauptsächlich. Wir bekommen gelegentlich Anfragen für Windows über WinUI 3 oder macOS Catalyst Apps, aber der ROI rechtfertigt selten den zusätzlichen Entwicklungsaufwand.
809. Wir nutzen Conditional Compilation und Platform Channels extensiv. Flutters MethodChannel, React Natives NativeModules oder Capacitors Plugins lassen uns bei Bedarf auf native APIs zugreifen, wobei das die Komplexität der Testing-Pipelines erhöht.
810. Also hier ist die Sache, Firebase hat SDKs für äh, alles, aber sie werden nicht gleich gut gepflegt, tatsächlich. Das Flutter Firebase SDK ist exzellent, React Natives react-native-firebase ist community-getrieben aber solide, während Xamarins Implementierung oft bei Features hinterherhinkt.
811. Genau, also wir nutzen im Grunde Appium für End-to-End-Testing, äh, kombiniert mit plattformspezifischen Tools. BrowserStack und Sauce Labs helfen mit Device Farms, aber Test-Suites über iOS Simulator, Android Emulator und echte Geräte zu pflegen erfordert konstante Aufmerksamkeit.
