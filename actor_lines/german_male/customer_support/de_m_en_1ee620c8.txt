Scenario: cattle rancher, no-nonsense and wanting direct answers about a feed supplier charge

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Right. So. Got charged twice for one feed delivery.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, I'm so sorry to hear about that double charge, let me just, uh, pull up your account here and—hmm—if you could give me your, um, account number or the order reference?

Customer [en]: Sure. It's, uh—wait, let me—order 4782.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so, um, I'm looking at order FED-4782-XR and, uh, yes I can definitely see the issue here—there's, um, two charges on October 15th for $1,847 each and that's, er, obviously not right.

Customer [en]: Obviously. Fantastic catch there.

Customer Support [en]: I, um, I really wish I could just reverse this right away but, uh, unfortunately with feed supplier charges over $1,500, I need to, er, submit this to our billing disputes team with reference code DSP-9847-K.

Customer [en]: Of course you do.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know, it's, um, it's really frustrating and I'm, uh, genuinely sorry about the process here—the dispute team usually, er, takes about 3-5 business days to review these and, um, then they'll issue the refund.

Customer [en]: Three to five days. With my money. Great.

Customer Support [en]: So, ummm, I can see you've been a customer since, uh, 2019 and this is, er, actually your first billing issue which—um—I'm going to note that in the dispute file DSP-9847-K to hopefully, you know, expedite things a bit.

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, first time because I actually—no wait—I check my statements.

Customer Support [en]: Right, right, and, um, that's exactly why this shouldn't have happened—let me, uh, also add a priority flag here and, er, actually I'm seeing the supplier code is SUP-447 which, hmm, they've had similar issues recently.

Customer [en]: Similar issues. Meaning they're doing this to everyone?

Customer Support [en]: Well, I, um, I can't speak to other accounts but, uh, let's just say your case reference DSP-9847-K is, er, going to include some additional notes about, um, pattern concerns with vendor SUP-447.

Customer [en]: Uh-huh. So I just wait then. That's—that's it?

Customer Support [en]: Unfortunately, um, for the actual refund, yes, but, uh, what I can do right now is, er, issue you a credit memo CMO-7739-PL for the duplicate amount that you can, um, apply to your next order immediately if you need to place one.

Customer [en]: A credit. Not my actual money back.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, you'll definitely get the actual refund—that's, uh, guaranteed with case DSP-9847-K—but the credit memo CMO-7739-PL is, er, just if you need to order more feed before the refund processes, so you're not, um, you know, out double the cash.

Customer [en]: Right. Um, fine. Whatever. Just—just process it.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, so, um, I've got everything submitted now—you'll get an email with, uh, both reference numbers DSP-9847-K and CMO-7739-PL, and, er, honestly if it's not resolved by Thursday, please call back and, um, specifically ask for escalation to management, okay?
