=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so okay, I just got this charge and, hmm, let me see here... it's for ninety-seven dollars? And I definitely didn't authorize this, I mean...

Customer Support [en]: Oh hey there! Um, let me just, uh—sorry, let me pull that up. Account number ACS-4492-BN7. Okay. So. Between you and me? These auto-renewals are, um, kind of sneaky.

Customer [en]: Right? That's what I thought! Um, so like, I signed up for the free trial last year, and then I forgot about it, but then nothing happened for months so...

Customer Support [en]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So what I'm seeing here is, uh, transaction TXN-885421-QW. It's—wait no, sorry—that's the wrong one. Here we go. TXN-885423-QW. Looks like it, um, it kind of hibernated? Then reactivated.

Customer [en]: Hibernated? What does that even mean? How do I know this isn't some kind of, um... I mean, are you sure this is even real?

Customer Support [en]: Totally get it. I mean, uh, honestly? I'd probably think the same thing. Let me, er, let me show you something cool though. Reference code REF-2234-XKL9. That's your original signup. See the gap?

Customer [en]: Um, yeah, so there's like eight months where nothing... hmm, and then suddenly BAM, they charge me?

Customer Support [en]: Right right. Exactly.

Customer [en]: But that doesn't make any sense! Let me see here... um, wouldn't they have to notify me or something before just...

Customer Support [en]: So, um, technically—and I'm kind of, uh, not supposed to say this—but they did send an email to, er, let me check... is it still the hotmail address? MSG-ID-7789-PLK2? But, um, between us? Those emails are, uh, pretty easy to miss.

Customer [en]: Hotmail? Oh god, I haven't checked that in, um... hmm, maybe that's where all the... but still, that seems really shady, you know?

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely. Like, um, super shady. Here's what I'm gonna do though. I'm, uh—I mean, I think I can—let me just... okay. Refund authorization RFD-9982-MNX1. Full amount. Plus, um, kind of throwing in next month free if you want to keep it?

Customer [en]: Wait, really? Um, so you're just gonna... but hmm, what if this happens again though?

Customer Support [en]: So here's the, um, here's the insider trick. Ready? I'm putting a note—NOTE-4451-BVX9—that says, uh, "manual renewal only." That means it literally, er, it can't charge you unless you physically call us.

Customer [en]: Okay but, um, let me think... how do I know that note will actually stick? What if someone else just...

Customer Support [en]: Ah. Good question. Um, so I'm actually, uh, I'm gonna send you confirmation code CNF-8827-TTR3. Screenshot that. If anyone ever, um, tries anything? That's like your, uh, your get-out-of-jail-free card. That code means I personally guaranteed it.

Customer [en]: Um, okay so... hmm, you seem actually helpful, not like the last person who just kept saying "policy this" and...

Customer Support [en]: Ugh, yeah. Some reps are, um, they're really by-the-book. But like, er, customer loyalty code CLY-3398-QQZ1? That's going on your account too. That basically means you get, uh, you get the cool rep treatment from now on.

Customer [en]: Wow, um, okay! So the refund will show up when? And I should screenshot that code you said...?

Customer Support [en]: So, um, refund hits in, uh, three to five days. Processing number PRC-6671-AAL2. And yeah! Screenshot, er, screenshot everything. Oh and, um, one more thing? Check your email. Not the hotmail. I'm sending you, uh, my direct extension. Just in case.
