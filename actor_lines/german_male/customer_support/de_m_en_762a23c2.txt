Scenario: trying to downgrade their subscription plan

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I need to downgrade my business subscription from the Premium to Standard plan immediately.

Customer Support [en]: I understand completely. Let me pull up your account right away. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your subscription?

Customer [en]: The account email is operations@meridiantech.com and the account number should be BUS-4472-XX.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, thank you. I have your account here showing the Premium plan at $299 monthly under account BUS-4472-XX. Before we proceed with the downgrade, may I ask what specific features you're looking to adjust?

Customer [en]: We're restructuring our budget and the advanced analytics features aren't being utilized enough to justify the cost.

Customer Support [en]: I appreciate you sharing that context. The Standard plan at $149 monthly includes your core features like project management, team collaboration for up to 25 users, and basic reporting. You would lose access to the advanced analytics suite and priority support.

Customer [en]: That's acceptable. What's the process for making this change and when would it take effect?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I can process this change right now and it would take effect at your next billing cycle on December 15th. You'll receive a prorated credit of $127.50 for the remaining Premium days, which will be applied to your Standard plan invoice.

Customer [en]: Actually, is there any way to make the change effective immediately rather than waiting?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, I can make that happen. Let me override the standard billing cycle and process this as ticket TKT-9823-MD. The change will be active within the next 2 hours and you'll see the prorated credit today.

Customer [en]: That's excellent. Will I lose access to my current data or need to migrate anything?

Customer Support [en]: Not at all. All your existing data, projects, and user configurations remain intact. The only change is that reports generated after the downgrade won't include the advanced metrics from modules AM-7 through AM-12.

Customer [en]: Good to know. Can you send me written confirmation of these changes and the new billing structure?

Customer Support [en]: Of course. I'm preparing a detailed confirmation email right now with reference number REF-2024-112-8847. It will include your new subscription terms, the credit amount, and a comparison chart of your previous versus current features.

Customer [en]: I also need to ensure my team leaders are notified about the feature changes before they lose access.

Customer Support [en]: That's very thoughtful planning. I can schedule an automated notification to be sent to all admin users on your account 24 hours before the change completes. Would you like me to include a custom message from you?

Customer [en]: Yes, please add that they should export any advanced analytics reports they need by end of day tomorrow.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, I've added that message. The notification will go out at 3:00 PM your time zone, giving everyone approximately 23 hours to export their reports. Is there anything else you'd like me to address regarding this transition?

Customer [en]: That covers everything. I appreciate how smoothly you've handled this process.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you so much for that feedback. Your new Standard plan will be active within 2 hours, confirmation email with reference REF-2024-112-8847 is on its way, and your team will be notified tomorrow. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you need anything else.
