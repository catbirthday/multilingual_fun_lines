=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, I just... I got this letter and, uh, my credit limit is... er, it's cut? I don't... I can't...

Customer Support [en]: Right right. So I can pull that up—let me just—actually your account number ending in 4782, I see the adjustment here from October 15th.

Customer [en]: But I, um, I pay on time. Every month. So, like, why would they just...

Customer Support [en]: So the thing is—wait, let me—okay so basically, um, the system flagged account ACT-4782-MK for, uh, what we call a periodic review, and um, based on the credit report pull CRB-892341, there were some changes.

Customer [en]: Changes? What changes? I haven't done anything.

Customer Support [en]: I understand, and um, so like, the report shows—er, let me be specific here—three new, uh, credit inquiries in September and, um, your utilization across all cards jumped to, uh, 78%.

Customer [en]: Oh. Um. Yeah. So basically my car just... and then the, uh, the medical bills and I just... I can't...

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: I'm just, um, trying so hard to keep up and, er, now this? Like, how am I supposed to, um, manage when they take away the cushion?

Customer Support [en]: I know this is—I mean, um, I'm really sorry about—actually let me, uh, look at what options—so your new limit in system code LMT-4782-R2 is $3,000, down from, er, $8,000.

Customer [en]: Three thousand. That's... that's less than I owe.

Customer Support [en]: Right, so you're at $4,200 currently, which means—and I know this isn't ideal—but that puts you overlimit by $1,200.

Customer [en]: Oh god. Um. So like, what happens now? Do I, uh, have to pay that immediately? Because I just... I literally can't...

Customer Support [en]: No no, you don't—I mean, we're not demanding immediate payment. The system note SNT-445692 shows you have until your next statement date, November 22nd, to bring it under.

Customer [en]: Okay. Okay so that's... let me think here... that's something.

Customer Support [en]: And actually—um, wait, I'm seeing—so there's a, uh, hardship program code HRD-789-TEMP that I could, er, potentially apply if you're, um, experiencing temporary financial difficulty?

Customer [en]: Really? Oh my god, um, yes, that would be—I mean, er, you're actually helping? Like, really helping?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely.

Customer [en]: Thank you. Seriously. Everyone else just... but you're actually listening.

Customer Support [en]: So I've added note CSN-445693-H to start that process. You'll get an email within 24 hours with the hardship application, and once approved, we can work on more manageable terms.
