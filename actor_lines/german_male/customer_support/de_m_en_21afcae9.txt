=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So, um, I'm sorry to bother you but like... I was supposed to get a callback yesterday?

Customer Support [en]: Oh! Um, let me just... what's the... okay so I'm pulling up your account here. Can I get your... actually wait, do you have your case number? It should be like... CSE-something?

Customer [en]: I think it's it's... CSE-4821-B? Sorry, I'm just... really bad with numbers.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect! CSE-4821-B. Right. So, um... okay between you and me? This is... hmm, this is actually kind of embarrassing. Your callback was scheduled for 2 PM yesterday. And it looks like... well...

Customer [en]: Yeah, so basically I waited all afternoon and, um, nothing.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I know. Look, I'm gonna... what's the word... level with you here. Agent ID AGT-9923 was supposed to call. But there was this whole... thing. System crash. Total mess. Nobody's callbacks went through.

Customer [en]: Oh. Oh god, I'm sorry, I thought I thought maybe I gave the wrong number or something.

Customer Support [en]: No no no! Um, definitely not your fault. Like, at all. So here's what I'm gonna do... and don't, uh, don't mention this to anyone else calling in... but I can get you a priority callback. Within the hour. Guaranteed.

Customer [en]: That's... I mean, um, that's really nice but like, I don't want to cause trouble.

Customer Support [en]: Trouble? Nah. Between us? Um, I've got this little... workaround. Ticket TKT-88542-QV is getting, uh, let's say... creatively reclassified. VIP status. You didn't hear it from me though, yeah?

Customer [en]: I just... I can't... sorry, it's been such a long week and everything's just...

Customer Support [en]: Hey. Hey, I get it. Look, um, what was your original issue about? Like the... the thing you needed help with?

Customer [en]: So so basically my account got, um, double-charged? Three times actually.

Customer Support [en]: Three times?! Okay so... hmm... let me just... Reference RFD-6677-AA, RFD-6678-AB, and... yep, RFD-6679-AC. All on the same day. That's... wow. No wonder you're...

Customer [en]: Yeah. And I'm just... sorry, I'm being so emotional about this, it's it's stupid.

Customer Support [en]: Um, no? Not stupid. At all. So like... here's the deal. I'm expediting all three refunds. Right now. Processing ID PRC-445821-X. Should hit your account in... 24 hours. Max.

Customer [en]: Really? I mean, um, they said they said it would take like five to seven business days last time.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah well... that's the, uh, official line. But since we completely dropped the ball on your callback... I'm using override code OVR-1127. Don't, um, don't tell my supervisor I have that code, okay?

Customer [en]: I don't know what to say, I'm just so so relieved, um, thank you.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, um, pleasure's all mine. Confirmation number CNF-9884521-K for everything. And listen... if you need anything else? Ask for me directly. Agent Maria. ID MRA-4455. I'll, uh... I'll make sure you're taken care of.
