=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, hi. I need to—sorry, I mean, uh, I bought this. Last month? No wait. Six weeks. Um.

Customer Support [en]: Oh, um, okay, hi there! I can definitely, uh, help you with that today. Let me just, um, pull up your account here and, er, we'll take a look at what's going on, okay?

Customer [en]: Look I know. Not your fault. System's the system.

Customer Support [en]: That's, um, that's really kind of you to say actually. So, uh, can I maybe get your order number? It should be something like, um, ORD and then some numbers after it?

Customer [en]: Yeah it's, um, hang on—no that's the—sorry. ORD-4. 4492. Um. LS91?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, I've got it here. ORD-4492-LS91. I can see this was purchased on October 2nd, so that would make it about... forty-three days ago.

Customer [en]: Right. Past thirty days. I get it.

Customer Support [en]: Well, um, so technically yes, but, uh, let me just, hmm, check something here because I think maybe we can, um, you know, work something out?

Customer [en]: Really? I just—sorry, I mean, um, I tried the chat thing and they just. Cut me off. You know?

Customer Support [en]: Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened. That must have been really frustrating. Let me dig a little deeper into your account RET-4492-B here.

Customer [en]: You're actually. Listening. That's nice.

Customer Support [en]: Of course I am! So, um, I'm looking at your history and, uh, you've been with us for, hmm, three years? And, um, zero returns before this, which is, uh, honestly really impressive.

Customer [en]: Yeah I don't—I mean, um, usually stuff works? But this thing just. Stopped. After five weeks.

Customer Support [en]: Okay, so it sounds like maybe this is less about buyer's remorse and more about a defect? Because that changes things quite a bit actually.

Customer [en]: Defect. Right. Yes.

Customer Support [en]: So, um, what I'm going to do is, uh, I'm going to file this under warranty claim WRN-8826-QM instead of a return, and, um, that gives us a lot more, er, flexibility with the timing?

Customer [en]: Wait you can—um, sorry, you can just. Do that? They said—the chat said no way.

Customer Support [en]: Well, I think the chat system probably just saw the date and auto-declined. But I'm actually looking at your case, and with defective items, we have a ninety-day warranty window, not thirty.

Customer [en]: You're really. Helping. Thanks.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! So, um, I've approved the warranty return under code WRN-8826-QM, and, uh, you should get an email with the shipping label in, hmm, about five minutes? And, um, we'll get you a replacement as soon as we receive the defective one, okay?
