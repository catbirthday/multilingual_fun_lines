Subject: A stranger complimenting your collaborative approach during a difficult community meeting

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [surprised] Okay, that was... weird. [pause] This woman just came up to me after the meeting—I don't even know her name—and she said my approach was, um, "refreshing." [confused] Like, what does that even mean? [short pause] I was just trying to get people to actually listen to each other instead of, you know, screaming over each other. [hesitantly] And I guess... I mean, maybe it worked? [relieved] God, that meeting was such a mess at first. [anxious] Everyone was so angry about the parking restrictions and I thought—I honestly thought someone was gonna throw a chair. [laugh] But then when I suggested we, uh, break into smaller groups and actually write down concerns instead of just yelling them... [trailing off] I don't know, people actually did it. [warm] And this stranger noticed. [shy] She said I had this, what did she call it, "collaborative spirit" that the community needed. [chuckle] Me. [pause] The person who usually just sits in the back and, um, avoids all conflict. [sincerely] Maybe I actually helped today? [happy] That feels... hmm, that feels really good actually.
