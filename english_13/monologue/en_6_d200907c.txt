Subject: Your private equity analyst recommendation just cost pensioners their life savings

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I keep looking at the numbers and they're... they're not changing. [pause] Eighty-seven percent loss. [very quietly] Eighty-seven percent of their retirement funds, just gone. [sigh] I mean, the model was solid, the fundamentals were—God, listen to me. [bitter] Still talking like an analyst when these people are calling, crying about how they can't, um... can't afford their medication now. [upset] One woman said she's seventy-eight and might have to go back to work. [loudly] Seventy-eight! [regretful] And I'm the one who wrote "strong buy" on that recommendation. [pause] My boss keeps saying it was, you know, market conditions, unprecedented volatility, but that's—that's bullshit and we both know it. [angry] We pushed too hard for the quarterly numbers. [crying while speaking] I knew the leverage ratios were concerning but I just... I thought we had more time to unwind the position. [sniffle] These aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet anymore. [very slowly] They're real people who trusted us with everything they had. [whispering] And I destroyed their lives with a PowerPoint presentation and some Excel formulas. [long pause] How do you even, er... how do you apologize for that? [very sad] You can't.
