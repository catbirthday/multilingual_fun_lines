[laugh] I finally figured it out. God, I was so scared of that thing. Every time I walked past it, I'd just... I'd pretend I didn't see it, you know? [embarrassed] Like if I ignored it hard enough, maybe someone else would deal with it.\n\nBut today I thought, hmm, what if I just tried? Really tried. And the manual—oh my god, the manual actually made sense this time. [excited] The tension settings, the paper guides, that weird lever thing that I thought was broken but turns out you have to pull it twice? All of it just clicked! [gasp softly] I made twenty perfect bound reports. Twenty! \n\n[very quietly] I kept waiting for it to jam or, I don't know, catch fire or something. But it didn't. It just... worked. [relieved] And Sarah walked by and she was like \"Oh, you got it working?\" Like it was no big deal. But it IS a big deal! [proud] I conquered that stupid machine. [chuckle] Tomorrow I'm binding everything. Everything."
