Subject: Your matte painter work on the film that was supposed to launch your career got completely cut

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Six months. Six months I spent on those mattes. [frustrated] Every single skyline, every building extension, every goddamn cloud formation that made their stupid alien invasion look believable. [pause] And they just... cut it all? [bitter] The director told me this morning like it was nothing. [mocking] "We're going in a different direction with the third act." [angry] A different direction! [laugh] They reshot the entire ending apparently. [very sad] My parents already told everyone about this film. [shaky voice] They've been so proud, telling their friends their kid finally made it to a real studio production. [sigh] I turned down two other jobs for this. [very quietly] Two actual paying jobs because this was supposed to be the one. [trailing off] The one that gets me noticed, that gets me... [upset] And now it's just gone. [pause] I keep refreshing the film's page, thinking maybe they'll change their minds. [bitter] But they won't. [exhausted] They already released the new trailer yesterday. [regretful] None of my work is in it. [angry] Not a single frame! [very sad] I don't even know if I can put this on my reel now. [frustrated] What am I supposed to say? [quietly] "Here's six months of work that, um, that nobody will ever see"? [sigh] God, I'm so tired.
