Mom with her worried calls, Dad sending money for \"groceries\" that we both knew wasn't for groceries. [sad] My sister organizing those interventions that never worked but made everyone feel like they were helping. [sigh] And now I'm clean—six months clean—and they don't know what to do with me. [confused] It's like I broke the rules or something? [short pause] I went to dinner last week and Mom kept asking if I was \"really okay\" like she was, I don't know, disappointed? [frustrated] She literally said \"you seem different.\" [laugh] Yeah Mom, I'm not high anymore! [regretful] But the thing is... without the crisis, without me being the mess they could rally around, we have nothing to talk about. [very sad] Twenty years of our entire relationship being about my addiction and now it's just... silence. [pause] Dad hasn't called in three weeks. [whispering] I think they miss the version of me that needed saving. [bitter] Because at least that version gave them a purpose, right? [sniffle] And now I'm just... I'm nobody to them."
