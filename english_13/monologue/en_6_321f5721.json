In a town where the main employer shut down eighteen months ago. [pause] You know, everyone thought I was crazy backing a battery recycling startup that wanted to set up in the middle of nowhere Ohio. The other VCs literally laughed—\"Why not Austin? Why not Boston?\" [proud] But I knew. I could feel it in my gut when that twenty-three-year-old kid pitched me with dirt under his fingernails because he'd been working in his dad's garage. [slowly] His dad who lost his job when the steel plant closed. [emotional] Marcus just told me they had two thousand applications. Two thousand people hoping for a chance. And they're not just hiring engineers, they're training people—welders, technicians, logistics. Real jobs with benefits. [voice breaking] There's this one guy, fifty-seven years old, he'd been unemployed for a year, and he just... he broke down crying at orientation. [pause] Look, I've made plenty of money on exits before. But this is, um... this is different. This isn't about multiples or valuations. [very quietly] We actually changed something. We brought a town back to life. [sniffle]"
