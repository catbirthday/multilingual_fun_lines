=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [hesitantly] I've been meaning to tell you something for a while now. [pause] You probably don't even realize this, but um... the way you were with me during the whole divorce thing? [very sincerely] It literally saved me. [sigh] I know that sounds dramatic but it's true. [emotional] When everyone else was, er, pushing me to "just get over it" or telling me I needed to be stronger, you just... you let me be a mess. [chuckle] Remember when I couldn't stop crying in the break room that one Tuesday? [warmly] You just sat there and handed me tissues. [pause] Didn't try to fix anything or give advice. [getting emotional] And when I'd, hmm, when I'd ramble about the same stuff over and over—God, I must have told you about the custody battle like fifty times—you never once made me feel like I was being too much. [sniffle] That patience you showed, it was... I don't know, it kept me going somehow. [very quietly] There were days I didn't think I'd make it through. [pause] But knowing I could come to work and you'd just, um, you'd understand? [grateful] That made all the difference. [warm] So yeah, I just... thank you. [very sincerely] Really, thank you.
