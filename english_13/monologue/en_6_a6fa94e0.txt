Subject: Your adolescent child choosing to live with your ex-spouse because you're "too strict" about grades and responsibility

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] Too strict. That's what she said to me. Too strict about grades and responsibility. [pause] Like expecting a B average and doing your homework is somehow abusive. [frustrated] And now she wants to live with her dad full-time because what, because he lets her stay up until 2 AM on school nights? [sarcastic] Because he doesn't check if she actually studied for her tests? Great parenting, really stellar. [hurt] I'm the bad guy for caring about her future. [pause] For wanting her to actually, I don't know, succeed in life? [angry] Meanwhile he gets to be the fun weekend dad who never has to enforce anything. [stuttering] I-I've been doing this alone for three years. [very sad] Three years of making sure she gets to school, checking her assignments, going to parent-teacher conferences by myself while he shows up twice a year and suddenly he's parent of the year. [crying while speaking] She looked at me like I was some kind of monster. [pause] Maybe I am, um... maybe I am too hard on her. [regretful] But I just wanted her to have options, you know? [quietly] To not struggle like I did. [bitter] And now she's choosing him. [long pause] [exhausted] Fine. Let him deal with the real parenting for once.
