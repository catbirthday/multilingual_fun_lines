=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I saw him at Mrs. Chen's door yesterday and I just... knew. [pause] Something about the way he held that clipboard, the way he leaned in when she started talking. [quietly] God, I used to do that exact same thing. The whole "concerned neighbor from the gas company" routine—I mean, I ran that one for, what, three years? [regretful] So when he started in with the whole "we detected a leak" thing, I just walked right over. [confidently] "Hey buddy, which division you with?" [chuckle] Should've seen his face. He starts fumbling around, says he's new, and I'm like, hmm, weird how you don't have a vehicle or any actual equipment. [sarcastic] Just that clipboard and a very official-looking vest from Amazon. [angry] These people, Mrs. Chen and Mr. Rodriguez, they're not marks, okay? [shaky voice] They're my neighbors. They bring me soup when I'm sick. [pause] So yeah, I called him out, told him I knew exactly what he was doing because—well, because I invented half these plays. [bitter] Takes one to know one, right? [relieved] But at least now I can use all that... knowledge for something good. [warm] Mrs. Chen made me cookies afterwards. [very quietly] Said I was her guardian angel or something. [sigh] If only she knew.
