I mean, I'm sitting here looking at this invitation and it says—it literally says \"legendary contributions to the field.\" [pause] Gosh, when did that happen? When did I become the person that, um... that younger people look up to? [nostalgic] I remember being twenty-five, terrified, screwing up that first major project so badly I thought my career was over. And now they want me to mentor the next generation. [laugh] \n\nThe thing is, I still feel like I'm figuring it out, you know? Like, honestly, half the time I'm just... I'm winging it. [anxiously] What if they realize I don't have all the answers? What if I'm actually, erhm, terrible at teaching? [pause] \n\nBut then I think about Martinez, how she took me under her wing when I was nobody. [warm] She probably felt the same way. Maybe that's the point—we're all just, hmm, passing on what we learned from our mistakes. [smiling speaking] God, I can't wait to meet these kids. They're going to be brilliant. Way more brilliant than I ever was. [emotionally] And that's... yeah, that's exactly how it should be."
