[pause] I keep her file open on my screen longer than I should, staring at her photo, at the kids' names in her emergency contacts. Two daughters. [sigh] Same ages as mine, actually. [very quietly] But the protocol says experimental treatment isn't covered, so that's—that's what I type. Protocol denied. Claim rejected. [bitter] I've gotten really good at the wording. Professional. Apologetic but firm. Never personal. [pause] They pay me seventy-eight thousand a year. With benefits. Dental for the kids, ironically enough. College savings. The mortgage on our place. [shaky voice] Yesterday this man called, sobbing about his wife's medication, and I had to tell him... [trailing off] [long pause] I had to tell him no. While my own family's prescriptions sit filled in my bag. [very sad] My daughter asked me last week what I do at work. I said I help people with their insurance. [laugh] Help. That's, um... that's one way to put it. [regretful] Sometimes I wonder if the people I deny think about me. If they picture someone like me. A person with their own bills, their own kids. Or if I'm just a letterhead. A stamp. [very quietly] God, I hope I'm just a stamp."
