Subject: Finally mastering the bindery machine that's intimidated you for months

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [nervous] Okay, so I just... I actually did it. The bindery machine, the one that's been sitting there like some kind of, um, mechanical nightmare for literally months? [laugh] I finally figured it out. God, I was so scared of that thing. Every time I walked past it, I'd just... I'd pretend I didn't see it, you know? [embarrassed] Like if I ignored it hard enough, maybe someone else would deal with it.

But today I thought, hmm, what if I just tried? Really tried. And the manual—oh my god, the manual actually made sense this time. [excited] The tension settings, the paper guides, that weird lever thing that I thought was broken but turns out you have to pull it twice? All of it just clicked! [gasp softly] I made twenty perfect bound reports. Twenty! 

[very quietly] I kept waiting for it to jam or, I don't know, catch fire or something. But it didn't. It just... worked. [relieved] And Sarah walked by and she was like "Oh, you got it working?" Like it was no big deal. But it IS a big deal! [proud] I conquered that stupid machine. [chuckle] Tomorrow I'm binding everything. Everything.
