[warm] Three years ago she was running... well, she was in a difficult situation, managing other women in that life. [pause] And now? She just opened her third location for her catering business. Third! [very excited] I mean, she's employing twelve people now—some of them women she used to know from before. [short pause] That's what this is really about.\n\n[relieved] We had so many people saying it wouldn't work, that these women couldn't change, couldn't run legitimate businesses. But they already knew how to manage people, handle finances, deal with, um... difficult clients. [chuckle] Those are business skills, right? We just helped them redirect everything.\n\n[passionately] The hardest part isn't teaching them business—they know business. It's helping them believe they deserve this second chance.
