That's why Mom always knew when I was struggling at work. That's why Dad randomly called that time I had the fight with Marcus. I thought they were just, I don't know, weirdly intuitive or something. [bitter] But no, it was just Emma. Sweet little Emma who I trusted with everything. [sigh] God, I'm such an idiot. All those times I defended her to our parents, told them to ease up on her, and she was just... what, collecting information? [angry] Like some kind of family spy? That's so messed up. And the worst part is she'd sit there while I vented about Mom and Dad, nodding along like she understood, like we were on the same team. [hurt] We were never on the same team, were we? [pause] I don't even know what to do with this. Do I confront her? Do I tell our parents I know? Everything feels, um... everything feels fake now. Every conversation, every laugh, every time she asked how I was doing—was any of it real? Or was she just, uh, gathering intel for her next report? [very sad] I thought we were close. I really thought we were close."
