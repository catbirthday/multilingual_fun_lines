[warm] And when she played that first chord—God, I actually felt it in my chest, you know? [laughs] Like my ribs were resonating with the soundboard. [very sincerely] I mean, I've made guitars before, but this one was, um... it was different somehow. [hesitantly] The rosette alone took me three weeks—I kept thinking it wasn't quite right, kept starting over. [chuckle] My wife said I was being obsessive. [quickly] But then when I saw those tears rolling down her face while she played that melody... [pause] Jesus. [emotional] That's why we do this, isn't it? [trailing off] Not for the money, God knows there's no money in this... [laughs] But for that moment when the wood you've been, er, coaxing and shaping for months finally sings. [very excited] And it sang today! [relieved] All those nights wondering if I'd chosen the right spruce, if the tap tone was actually perfect or if I was just, hmm, convincing myself it was. [happy] Worth it. [sigh] Every blister, every time I had to scrap a binding because it chipped. [passionately] When an instrument can make someone cry like that—that's not craftsmanship anymore. [whispering] That's something else entirely."
