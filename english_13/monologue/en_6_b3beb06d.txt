Subject: The archery technician certification you studied for is no longer recognized in your state

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [frustrated] Are you kidding me? I just—I literally just got the email. [bitter] Three hundred hours. That's what I spent studying for this thing. The archery technician certification, the one that was supposed to, um... supposed to actually mean something. [sigh] And now they're telling me it's not recognized anymore? [angry] Like, what does that even mean? I passed the exam, I paid the fees, I did the practicum with actual compound bows and, err... recurves and all that technical stuff. [confused] How can they just decide it doesn't count? [pause] I mean, I turned down that job at the sporting goods store because I thought—well, I thought this certification would lead to something better. [regretful] God, I'm such an idiot. [very sad] My dad said I should've gone into HVAC instead but no, I had to follow my passion, right? [sarcastic] "Do what you love," everyone said. [upset] Yeah well, apparently what I love doesn't exist in this state anymore. [exhausted] So now I've got to what, start over? Take some new certification that'll probably be worthless in, hmm, two years? [long pause] I don't even know if I have it in me to do this again. [very quietly] I really thought this was it, you know?
