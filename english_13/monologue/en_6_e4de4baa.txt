Subject: Your new parent anxiety spiraled into checking the baby's breathing every ten minutes and your partner thinks you need help

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] I know what you're thinking, okay? I know. But I just—I need to check one more time. Just one more. [sigh] Look, you weren't there last night when she made that weird little sound, that sort of... I don't know, that wheeze? And yes, I know babies make sounds, everyone keeps telling me that, but what if this time it's different? [quickly] What if this is the one time I don't check and something's actually wrong? 

[frustrated] You keep saying I need help like I'm—like I'm crazy or something. I'm not crazy, I'm just... [pause] Okay, maybe setting my alarm for every ten minutes is a bit much. Maybe. But honestly? I'd rather be exhausted than miss something. [shaky voice] Because what kind of mother would I be if I just, you know, slept through something happening to her? 

[exhausted] And I get it, I really do. You need sleep, I need sleep, we're both walking around like zombies. [trailing off] But when I lie there in the dark, all I can think about is... [very quietly] what if she stops breathing and I'm just lying there doing nothing? 

[upset] So yeah, maybe I do need help. [sniffle] Maybe this isn't normal. But right now, checking on her is the only thing that makes me feel like I'm doing something right.
