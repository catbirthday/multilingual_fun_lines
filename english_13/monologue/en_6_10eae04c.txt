Subject: Winning the lawsuit against your former employer while watching them destroy evidence of other people's cases

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: They're actually doing it. Right there in the parking lot with the shredder truck, just... destroying everything. [bitter] Three years of fighting them and I won, but this is what victory looks like? [pause] I mean, I got my settlement, the judge ruled in my favor, but watching this... God. Those boxes, they're full of—I recognize Sarah's handwriting on that one. [upset] She's still fighting her case. [sigh] Was fighting, I guess. Because now all her evidence is just... gone.

My phone's been on this whole time.

[relieved] Oh thank God. [laugh] They're so stupid. They're literally destroying evidence in broad daylight and I'm getting all of it. [excited] This is—I mean, this might not help my case anymore but Sarah and Marcus and everyone else who's still... [hopeful] Yeah. Yeah, this changes everything. [very quietly] They're not getting away with this.
