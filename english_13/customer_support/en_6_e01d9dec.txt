Scenario: trying to dispute charges from a cancelled reservation

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So like I cancelled this reservation weeks ago but you still charged me—wait no, actually charged me twice?

Customer Support: Oh gosh, double charged after cancelling? That's, um, definitely not right. Let me pull up your account here... hmm, can you give me the reservation number or the email you used?

Customer: It's—hold on—I think RES-4472 something? God, I can't even find the email now.

Customer Support: No worries at all, take your time. Let me see here... okay so I'm searching for RES-4472 and, uh, I'm seeing a few options. Was this for a hotel stay around December 15th through the 18th?

Customer: Yes! That's it. So basically I cancelled on November 30th and like they said no charges.

Customer Support: Right right, I see exactly what happened here. So your cancellation was processed on November 30th at 3:47 PM, but then, errm, there's this weird thing where our system charged you $287.50 on December 1st and then again on December 3rd for the same amount.

Customer: Wait so—I don't—that's almost six hundred dollars for nothing!

Customer Support: I know, this is completely unacceptable. Honestly, looking at your account history, you've been with us since 2019, never had any issues before, so, um, what I'm gonna do is not just refund both charges immediately, but I'm also adding a $50 credit for this hassle.

Customer: Okay but like when? Because my credit card bill is due Friday.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely, so the refunds will show as pending within, hmm, let me check the exact timeframe... okay, within 2 to 4 hours, and they'll fully clear by Thursday morning at the latest, well before your Friday due date.

Customer: I mean—look, I just need this fixed. This whole trip was a disaster anyway.

Customer Support: Ah man, I'm really sorry to hear that. Let me see if... actually, you know what? Since this whole experience has been frustrating, I'm upgrading you to our platinum status for the next 6 months, which gives you free cancellations on any future bookings.

Customer: Oh. Um. That's—wait, so any cancellations? Like no fees at all?

Customer Support: Yep, zero fees, cancel anytime up to, uh, 24 hours before check-in. Your new member number is PLT-8827-MK6, and honestly, after what you've dealt with, it's the least we can do.

Customer: I guess—I mean, that's actually pretty helpful. So the refunds are processing now?

Customer Support: Mmm-hmm, processing as we speak. Your confirmation numbers are REF-92847-A for the first charge and, er, REF-92847-B for the second, both for $287.50, totaling $575.00 back to your card ending in 4429.

Customer: Okay so basically just wait and check Thursday morning?

Customer Support: Exactly. Though honestly? Based on how our system's running today, I'd, uhh, guess you'll probably see them by tonight. But Thursday morning is the absolute latest, guaranteed.

Customer: Fine. I mean—actually, thanks. You've been more helpful than I expected.

Customer Support: Hey, that's what I'm here for. Oh, and just so you know, I've added a note to your account about this whole situation, so if you need to book with us again and run into any issues, just reference case number CSE-7703-NK and any agent will see the full history. Take care, alright?
