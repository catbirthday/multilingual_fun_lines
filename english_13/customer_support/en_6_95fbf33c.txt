=== Dialogue ===

Customer: *exhales* So I bought this tablet. Yesterday? And now it's cheaper.

Customer Support: Oh oh oh, I see what happened here. Let me, um, pull up your account real quick. What's the order number? Should be something like ORD and then some numbers.

Customer: Hmm, let me see here... ORD-4. No wait. 4829-TX?

Customer Support: Perfect, er, I've got it here—ORD-4829-TX91 for the Samsung tablet. And you're right, it it dropped by $47 this morning. Between you and me, they should really warn people when these sales are coming.

Customer: *sharp inhale* Forty-seven? I thought... wasn't it sixty?

Customer Support: So the original price you paid was, um, $389.99, and now it's at $342.99. That's that's exactly $47 difference. Here's what I can do—technically we have a 14-day price protection window, which you're totally within.

Customer: Okay so that means... wait. You refund the forty? Or the whole thing?

Customer Support: Just the the difference, so you'd get $47 back. But, er, listen—I'm gonna check something for you because sometimes there's actually a promo code floating around that could stack with this. Give me just a sec.

Customer: *exhales* I'm probably doing this all wrong. Should I return it first?

Customer Support: No no no, definitely don't return it! That would be, um, such a hassle for you. Honestly? The system makes this way more complicated than it needs to be. Let me just just apply code MATCH15 here and... hmm, that's bringing your refund to $54.

Customer: Fifty... *sighs* See I don't get how it went up.

Customer Support: Right, so it's it's kind of backwards—the code gives you an extra 15% on top of the price difference. I know, uh, it makes zero sense but hey, more money back for you, right? The total credit will be $54.07.

Customer: Let me think... so I paid three-ninety. And I get back fifty-four?

Customer Support: Exactly, er, which brings your final cost down to $335.92. And between you and me? That's actually $7 better than today's sale price. Sometimes these these little glitches work in your favor.

Customer: *exhales heavily* Sorry. Math isn't... when's it happen?

Customer Support: The credit? Oh it'll show up in, um, 3 to 5 business days. I'm putting a note on your account—reference number REF-2847-PM—just in case there's any hiccup. Though honestly? These usually process faster, like 2 days max.

Customer: Hmm, what if I... can I use this REF thing for other stuff?

Customer Support: Ah no, that that reference number is just for tracking this specific refund. But, er, since you asked—we do have price protection on basically everything except clearance items. Code SAVE20 works on accessories through Friday if you need anything else.

Customer: *sharp exhale* Okay so... I just wait? That's it?

Customer Support: That's it! You'll get an email confirmation in about, um, 10 minutes with all the details. And honestly? You handled this perfectly—most people don't even know we do price matching. Your $54.07 credit is all set.
