=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm calling about order number 7834-JK. It shows delivered yesterday at 2:47 PM, but I never received it.

Customer Support: Thank you for contacting us. I apologize for this situation. Let me pull up order 7834-JK right away and review the delivery details to determine what happened.

Customer: I've been home all day yesterday and today. No package was left at my door or mailbox.

Customer Support: I understand your concern. According to our system, the driver marked it delivered to 4827 Oak Ridge Drive at 2:47 PM yesterday afternoon. Can you confirm this is your correct address?

Customer: Yes, that's my address. I've checked everywhere including behind bushes and with my neighbors.

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: I have security camera footage from yesterday. There was no delivery driver at my property at that time.

Customer Support: That's very helpful information. I'm filing an investigation report under case number INV-98234-XM. Our logistics team will review the GPS data from the driver's scanner within 24 hours.

Customer: What happens if they can't locate the package? This was a $450 purchase.

Customer Support: I completely understand your concern about this valuable order. We have several resolution options available. Once investigation INV-98234-XM is complete, we can either send a replacement immediately or issue a full refund.

Customer: How long will the investigation take? I need these items for a presentation next Tuesday.

Customer Support: The investigation typically completes within 24 to 48 hours. However, given your Tuesday deadline, I'm escalating this to priority status right now under expedite code EXP-7734.

Customer: If you send a replacement, can you guarantee it arrives before Tuesday?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I can process a replacement order today with overnight shipping at no additional charge. It would ship from warehouse facility 382 tonight and arrive Monday by 10:30 AM.

Customer: That would work. Can you send me written confirmation of this arrangement?

Customer Support: Of course. I'll send detailed confirmation to your email address on file within the next 15 minutes. The email will include your case number INV-98234-XM and replacement order details.

Customer: I also want to ensure I'm not charged twice if the original package appears.

Customer Support: That's already handled. I've placed a hold on any duplicate charges using protection code FIN-8829-PP. If the original arrives, you can keep it with our apologies for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thank you. Please confirm my email address before sending the documentation.

Customer Support: Your confirmation will be sent to the address ending in @techcorp.com that we have on file. You'll also receive tracking information once the replacement ships tonight from distribution center 382.
