=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So my referral bonus. Didn't apply. Of course.

Customer Support: Oh no—I'm so—let me pull that up. Account ending in 4782? I see you referred, um, three people last month. That should've triggered the fifty dollar credit.

Customer: Three people. Fifty bucks. And like... nothing.

Customer Support: That's—no that's not right at all. I can see why—hmm, wait. Your referral code REF-KMXY-9021 shows active but the credits are stuck in, uh, pending status since October 15th.

Customer: Pending. Great. So basically I did everything right and...

Customer Support: You did! You absolutely—let me just—sorry. This happens sometimes with our system. I'm gonna manually push these through right now, reference ticket TK-890234.

Customer: Hmm, what if it just... stays pending forever.

Customer Support: It won't—I promise—actually no, I'm fixing it. Right now. Just processed the first one, transaction ID TX-5567-AAB2.

Customer: Wait. You can actually fix it? Like right now?

Customer Support: Already am! Second credit just—there we go—posted. That's, er, another fifty, transaction TX-5568-AAB2. God, I hate when our system does this to people.

Customer: I just. I really need this money. Rent's due.

Customer Support: Oh I get it—trust me—final one processing. There! All three credits, total one-fifty, should hit your account within, um, two to four hours max.

Customer: Two to four hours. Okay so that means... today?

Customer Support: Today. Absolutely today. I've also—hang on—added a courtesy credit. Twenty-five dollars for the hassle, confirmation CC-7829-XM.

Customer: You didn't have to... I mean. Thank you.

Customer Support: Course I did! You referred—actually wait—three friends! That's huge. We should be thanking you.

Customer: Let me see here... so one-seventy-five total?

Customer Support: Exactly. One-seventy-five. I put a rush flag on it too, priority code RUSH-4499, so honestly? Probably gonna hit in like an hour.

Customer: An hour. Okay. Phew. That actually... that works.

Customer Support: Good! And hey—I put a note—your next referral? Double bonus. My direct line's 555-0147 extension 882 if you need anything.
