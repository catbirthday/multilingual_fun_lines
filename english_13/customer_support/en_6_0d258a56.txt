=== Dialogue ===

Customer: There's a charge. On my card. Don't know what it's for.

Customer Support: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear you're dealing with that—let me, um, let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this right away, okay?

Customer: [exhales] Hundred twenty dollars. Says... what's it... "Premium Service Fee."

Customer Support: Okay so I'm seeing that charge here, reference number TXN-4482-QM91, and it looks like—oh, I'm really sorry about this—it's linked to an auto-renewal that went through on November 15th.

Customer: Auto-renewal. I canceled that. Months ago.

Customer Support: I can absolutely understand your frustration, and let me see here... hmm, I'm showing a cancellation request from September 23rd but it looks like it didn't... I mean, the system shows it as pending instead of completed somehow.

Customer: Pending. Since September. [long pause] I just... I can't.

Customer Support: I know, I know, this is—I'm really sorry this happened, and honestly I wish I could just reverse it right now but I need to submit this through our disputes department with case number DSP-9021-KL.

Customer: How long.

Customer Support: So typically it takes, um, 5 to 7 business days for them to review everything, and then the refund would post within another 3 to 5 days after approval, which I know isn't ideal but...

Customer: Two weeks. For your mistake.

Customer Support: You're absolutely right, and I feel terrible about this—let me see if... okay so what I can do right now is apply a $30.00 courtesy credit immediately while we wait for the full refund to process.

Customer: Thirty. Out of one-twenty.

Customer Support: I know it's not enough, I really do, and if I had the authority to do more... the system only lets me apply credits up to tier 2, which maxes out at thirty dollars without supervisor override.

Customer: [sharp inhale] Fine. Whatever. Just... do it.

Customer Support: Okay, I'm processing that right now—credit code CRD-7734-XP is applied, you should see that within 24 hours, and I'm also, um, making sure to properly close out that subscription this time.

Customer: Should've been closed. In September.

Customer Support: You're completely right, it should have been, and I'm documenting everything here in ticket REF-5528-QT22 so if anything like this happens again—which it won't, but just in case—we have a full record of this conversation.

Customer: Mm. Anything else or...

Customer Support: Just need to confirm your email for the dispute confirmation—is it still the one ending in gmail.com? And, um, again, I'm really sorry we let you down here, I know this isn't how you wanted to spend your time today.
