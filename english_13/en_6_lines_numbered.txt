# Speaker Lines Only (English) - Actor 6
============================================================

1. I sincerely apologize for that frustrating experience. I'm going to personally handle your entire issue today without any transfers. Your case reference number is CS-892417-M, and I have full authorization to resolve billing, technical, and account matters.
2. I can definitely resolve that for you right now. I'm pulling up your business account ending in 4782, and I see you've had three attempted updates since Monday that were blocked by our security protocols.
3. Understood. The system flagged these as suspicious due to the sudden change. I'm overriding the security hold with authorization code SEC-77291-OVERRIDE, and we can process your new card immediately.
4. Perfect. I'm entering that information now. For security verification, I'll need the billing ZIP code and the CVV from your new corporate card ending in 8823.
5. Thank you. I've successfully updated your payment method. Your next automatic billing date is December 15th for $2,847.50, and I'm sending a confirmation to your registered email address.
6. I see you have five linked subsidiary accounts under master account MA-10984-CORP. I can apply this payment method to all of them right now if you'd like, which would save you from updating each one individually.
7. Absolutely. I'm updating all five subsidiary accounts now with batch process ID BP-20241129-K5M. This will take approximately 30 seconds, and each account will receive its own confirmation number.
8. I understand your frustration with the earlier calls. I've added priority status flag PRIO-GOLD-2024 to your master account, which means any future calls will route directly to senior support without transfers.
9. Certainly.
10. You'll receive the comprehensive summary within 15 minutes at your primary email address. It will include confirmation numbers SUB-001-CFM through SUB-005-CFM for each subsidiary account, plus instructions for your new priority support access code PSA-7761-EXEC.
11. Oh okay—so actually, I just went through this myself last week when I needed my own call records for a dispute, so I totally get it. Let me pull up your account real quick here, and I can see you had a call on Tuesday December 10th at 3:47 PM that lasted about 18 minutes.
12. Absolutely, yeah—so the thing is—normally these take 24 to 48 hours to process through our transcript system TRS-9000, but honestly? Since you sound like you really need this, let me see if I can expedite it for you.
13. So basically what I can do—and I'm doing this right now actually—is flag your request as priority code P1 instead of the standard P3, which should get it to you within 2 to 3 hours max.
14. Got it.
15. You know what—let me try something else. So there's this workaround I discovered when a customer had a similar urgent situation last month. If I access the call through our quality monitoring portal QMP-7.2 instead of the regular system, I can actually generate an instant unofficial transcript.
16. Right right—so basically it means it won't have the official case stamp CASE-892041 at the top, but the actual conversation content is identical, word for word, and I can have it in your inbox in literally 5 minutes.
17. Perfect, doing that now then. Just need to verify your email—is it still the one ending in @techcorp dot com that we have on file from your November 2023 registration?
18. Excellent—so I'm generating it now through QMP, and actually, you know what? Since you've had to jump through hoops here, I'm also gonna include the audio file MP3 format, just in case you need that for reference too.
19. Just sent it now actually—timestamp 4:23 PM Eastern, should hit your inbox any second. Also threw in the reference number REF-7829-TRANSCRIPT in the subject line so it doesn't get caught in spam filters.
20. Really glad I could—oh wait, before you go—I added my direct extension 4412 in the email, so if you need anything else from that conversation or run into any issues, just bypass the main queue and call me directly, okay?
21. Thank you for contacting us. I apologize for this situation. Let me pull up order 7834-JK right away and review the delivery details to determine what happened.
22. I understand your concern. According to our system, the driver marked it delivered to 4827 Oak Ridge Drive at 2:47 PM yesterday afternoon. Can you confirm this is your correct address?
23. Certainly.
24. That's very helpful information. I'm filing an investigation report under case number INV-98234-XM. Our logistics team will review the GPS data from the driver's scanner within 24 hours.
25. I completely understand your concern about this valuable order. We have several resolution options available. Once investigation INV-98234-XM is complete, we can either send a replacement immediately or issue a full refund.
26. The investigation typically completes within 24 to 48 hours. However, given your Tuesday deadline, I'm escalating this to priority status right now under expedite code EXP-7734.
27. Absolutely. I can process a replacement order today with overnight shipping at no additional charge. It would ship from warehouse facility 382 tonight and arrive Monday by 10:30 AM.
28. Of course. I'll send detailed confirmation to your email address on file within the next 15 minutes. The email will include your case number INV-98234-XM and replacement order details.
29. That's already handled. I've placed a hold on any duplicate charges using protection code FIN-8829-PP. If the original arrives, you can keep it with our apologies for the inconvenience.
30. Your confirmation will be sent to the address ending in @techcorp.com that we have on file. You'll also receive tracking information once the replacement ships tonight from distribution center 382.
31. Oh um, no worries at all. Let me... let me pull that up for you. So basically I'll need your email address, and then, uh, I can check what subscriptions we have under account ID ACC-8924-JV.
32. Got it got it. Okay so... hmm, I'm seeing three active subscriptions here. There's the Premium at $14.99, er, the Storage Plus at $7.99, and then like a third one for... oh this is the Archive Service at $23.50. Which one were you—which one did you want to cancel?
33. Right right.
34. Yeah absolutely, so the Premium started, uh, back in March with transaction TXN-3041-MM, and then Storage Plus was... hmm, January actually. The Archive one though, that's—that's from 2022. But hey, er, happens all the time, honestly.
35. Sure sure. So what I'll do is, um, I'll process those cancellations right now. Actually wait—let me check something. Looks like you've got, uh, 47GB stored in reference storage unit STG-9982-XL. Did you want to download that first?
36. No problem! So basically I'm gonna... I'm gonna send you a link. It'll be valid for, er, 72 hours, download code DL-7761-PQ. And then once you've got everything, we can—we can finish the cancellations.
37. Absolutely.
38. Oh! Yeah so, hmm, let me calculate this. Since we're... since we're mid-billing cycle, you'll get prorated refunds. Looking at... okay so that's roughly $31.24 total, reference number REF-5509-KT, and it'll post in like 3 to 5 business days.
39. Yeah yeah! And er, just so you know, if you ever want to reactivate, we keep your settings for 90 days under retention policy RET-90-STANDARD. But um, the download link—definitely grab that soon.
40. Happy to help! So I've got all three marked for cancellation, confirmation codes CAN-4421-AA, CAN-4422-BB, and uh, CAN-4423-CC. They'll process once you confirm via the email I just—I just sent. Anything else I can help with today?
41. Oh absolutely, I can definitely help you with that. Um, let me pull up your account here... I'll need your account number, or actually the email address works too if that's easier?
42. Perfect, got it. So I'm seeing the charge here from November 3rd, transaction ID TXN-9847-QM2, and it's showing as, uh, premium support package. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?
43. Mmm, I totally understand the confusion. So this is kind of interesting actually—the premium support gives you 24/7 phone access and priority ticket routing, but er, looking at your usage metrics here, you've never actually used any of these features. Zero tickets, zero calls before today.
44. Oh absolutely, yes. What I'm gonna do right now is, um, cancel that subscription effective immediately, and honestly? Between you and me, I think I can probably get you a refund for the last three months too, which would be $291 total.
45. Yeah so, hmm, it started September 3rd according to what I'm seeing here. But here's the thing—I can see there was never an explicit opt-in confirmation, which is, well, technically required. Let me process that full refund right now, reference number RFN-2893-XK.
46. Bingo! You got it. Er, so when you purchased the software license, order ORD-7729-BN4, there was apparently a pre-checked box for the premium support trial that converts to paid after 30 days. Super sneaky if you ask me.
47. I mean, technically it's sort of a gray area, but yeah, ethically? Not great. Anyway, I've submitted the refund which should hit your card ending in 4782 within 3-5 business days, and I'm also adding a note to flag this pattern for our product team.
48. Oh! Hmm, that's... interesting. Let me check something here real quick. Uh, okay so the 4782 card was used for the original software purchase, but you're right, your current default card is the 3901. Would you prefer the refund to go to the 3901?
49. Hey, no worries at all, we'll figure this out. So the 4782 card shows as still active in our system, but honestly? I can send the refund to whichever card you prefer. The 3901 might be faster since it's your current default.
50. Perfect, done! Changed it to the 3901, confirmation code CFM-1122-RT9. And honestly, while you're checking on that other card, maybe take a peek at any other subscriptions you might have forgotten about—happens to the best of us. Anything else I can help with today?
51. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear you're dealing with that—let me, um, let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this right away, okay?
52. Okay so I'm seeing that charge here, reference number TXN-4482-QM91, and it looks like—oh, I'm really sorry about this—it's linked to an auto-renewal that went through on November 15th.
53. I can absolutely understand your frustration, and let me see here... hmm, I'm showing a cancellation request from September 23rd but it looks like it didn't... I mean, the system shows it as pending instead of completed somehow.
54. I know, I know, this is—I'm really sorry this happened, and honestly I wish I could just reverse it right now but I need to submit this through our disputes department with case number DSP-9021-KL.
55. So typically it takes, um, 5 to 7 business days for them to review everything, and then the refund would post within another 3 to 5 days after approval, which I know isn't ideal but...
56. You're absolutely right, and I feel terrible about this—let me see if... okay so what I can do right now is apply a $30.00 courtesy credit immediately while we wait for the full refund to process.
57. I know it's not enough, I really do, and if I had the authority to do more... the system only lets me apply credits up to tier 2, which maxes out at thirty dollars without supervisor override.
58. Okay, I'm processing that right now—credit code CRD-7734-XP is applied, you should see that within 24 hours, and I'm also, um, making sure to properly close out that subscription this time.
59. You're completely right, it should have been, and I'm documenting everything here in ticket REF-5528-QT22 so if anything like this happens again—which it won't, but just in case—we have a full record of this conversation.
60. Just need to confirm your email for the dispute confirmation—is it still the one ending in gmail.com? And, um, again, I'm really sorry we let you down here, I know this isn't how you wanted to spend your time today.
61. I sincerely apologize for the frustration you've experienced. Let me pull up our system status and your account information right away. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your account?
62. Thank you, Ms. Morrison. I've located your account, customer ID CMR-85924-JM, and I completely understand the urgency with tax season. Our web servers experienced intermittent outages between 2:15 and 3:45 PM Eastern today.
63. Absolutely. I have three immediate solutions for you. First, I can email the documents directly to your registered address within the next five minutes using our secure document transfer protocol DOC-SECURE-7.
64. Certainly. I'm preparing those documents now. I show four 1099-INT forms, one 1099-DIV form, and your consolidated annual statement dated December 31st, 2023. Is that everything you need?
65. Yes, these are the official IRS-compliant documents with verification code VRF-2023-48921-TXD at the footer. They're identical to what you would download from the website.
66. Our technical team has implemented a permanent fix as of 4:00 PM Eastern. The platform should be fully stable now, but I'm also noting your account for priority callback status PCB-774 if you experience any further issues.
67. Of course. I show three active automatic transfers: weekly transfer TRN-8847-A every Monday for $500, monthly mortgage payment TRN-8849-C on the 15th for $2,847, and quarterly investment contribution TRN-8851-Q scheduled for April 1st.
68. I'm glad I could help resolve this quickly. Your secure email with reference number EML-95521-DOC has just been sent. You should receive it within two minutes.
69. Given today's service interruption, I've already applied service credit code SVC-CREDIT-0324 to your account. This waives all expedited transfer fees through March 31st.
70. You're very welcome, Ms. Morrison. I've documented everything in your account notes under case number CSE-20240315-8924. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
71. I sincerely apologize for that frustrating experience. Let me assist you directly with your billing concern right away. May I have your account number to get started?
72. Thank you. I have your account 558-42-9901 pulled up now and I can see the variance you're referring to. Your invoice increased from $1,247 to $1,621, and I'll identify exactly what caused this change.
73. I see the discrepancies. Three additional service codes were added on October 15th: codes SVC-7741, SVC-7742, and SVC-7745. These shouldn't be on your platinum tier agreement, and I'll investigate how they were applied.
74. Absolutely. These appear to be erroneously applied during our system migration on October 14th. Approximately 200 accounts were affected, and we've been proactively correcting them as customers contact us.
75. You're absolutely right to expect proactive communication. Our notification batch for affected accounts was scheduled for tomorrow, October 28th, but you've reached us first. Let me correct this immediately and ensure you receive proper compensation.
76. I'll process the correction right now. I'm removing all three erroneous charges totaling $374, and applying a courtesy credit of $50 for the inconvenience. Your service remains completely unaffected.
77. Certainly.
78. You're absolutely right, and I want to address that as well. I'm adding you to our Priority Direct Access list with code PDA-9847, which bypasses the automated system entirely for future calls.
79. Your adjusted invoice total is $1,247, matching your standard monthly rate. You'll receive the updated invoice within 2 hours via email, and the $50 credit will appear as line item CRD-10-28-621 on next month's statement.
80. I'm glad we could resolve everything efficiently today. I've documented all adjustments in ticket number TKT-558429 for your records, and you'll receive a summary email shortly with all these details confirmed.
81. Oh gosh okay so I'm looking at your account here and I see what happened you've got order TRX-9847-B that shipped yesterday at 2:47pm and then two more orders PND-3362-K and PND-3365-M that are still processing and I'm really sorry about the shipping situation that must be frustrating let me see what I can—
82. Right right so here's the thing and I feel terrible having to explain this but once an order hits our fulfillment queue which happens about 30 minutes after placement the system locks it and PND-3362-K entered fulfillment at warehouse W-847 this morning at 8:15am so technically I can't—sorry I mean the system won't let me merge them anymore even though I really wish I could...
83. I know I know and you're absolutely right it seems like it should be simple but basically our inventory gets allocated to specific pick zones and your items are already assigned to packers in sections A-14 and B-22 respectively and once that allocation happens the whole thing just—I mean it becomes this whole complicated mess that I can't manually override even though trust me I would if I could.
84. Absolutely yes!
85. Oh um well that's where it gets a little—so PND-3362-K has that bluetooth speaker that was on flash sale for $47.99 and it's back to $89.99 now and then your other order has the warranty plan SKU-WARR-2YR that was a limited promotion so if we cancel and reorder you'd lose those prices and I feel awful even telling you this...
86. It's actually $8.95 times three so $26.85 total and listen I'm going to do something here because this really isn't fair to you and you seem lovely and patient about this whole mess...
87. Right exactly and that's why I'm crediting your account $18.90 right now that's two of the three shipping charges and then for your next order I'm adding promo code SHIP-FREE-90 that'll give you free shipping on anything over $25 for the next 90 days because honestly this whole system is ridiculous sometimes and you shouldn't have to deal with this.
88. Of course of course and you know what I just noticed you're in delivery zone 4B which means if you ever need something super fast we have same-day delivery from our hub at 7823 Industrial Parkway for just $12.99 and a lot of people don't know about that option so I always like to mention it when I see local customers.
89. Yes unfortunately they are TRX-9847-B arrives Thursday and the other two should be Friday or Saturday latest tracking shows Friday by 3pm for both and I've added notes to your account ACC-558274 about this whole situation so if you call again anyone can see what happened and honestly I'm just sorry we couldn't combine them like you wanted...
90. Absolutely and hey those speakers you ordered are fantastic by the way my roommate has the same model SR-4000X and the sound quality is incredible especially for the price you got so at least there's that silver lining and again that promo code SHIP-FREE-90 is active on your account starting right now so definitely use that for your next order!
91. I completely understand your concern about potential fraud. Let me help you verify this right away. Can you tell me what information the caller requested from you?
92. Thank you for being cautious and reaching out to us directly. I can see in our system that we did flag 3 transactions on your account ending in 4782 for a total of $2,147.89, and our fraud department initiated outreach at 2:15 PM today.
93. Absolutely valid question. I can verify my identity several ways. First, I can confirm your last legitimate transaction was $67.42 at Meridian Coffee on November 8th, and your current rewards balance is 14,726 points.
94. Your account was opened on March 15, 2019, your statement closes on the 22nd of each month, and your last payment of $450 was received on October 28th. I can also provide you with our fraud department's direct line, which is 800-555-0199.
95. Certainly. The flagged transactions are: $849.99 at Electronics Megastore in Nevada, $754.00 at Digital Games Portal, and $543.90 at Tech Solutions International, all attempted between 1:30 and 1:47 PM today.
96. I'm going to immediately freeze your current card and issue a replacement. Your new card ending in 9351 will arrive via expedited shipping in 2-3 business days, and I'm filing dispute forms for all three fraudulent charges.
97. Absolutely not.
98. You'll receive an initial confirmation email within 30 minutes to case number FRD-20241109-4782. Our fraud investigation team typically completes their review within 5-7 business days, and provisional credits are usually applied within 48 hours.
99. I recommend updating your online password as a precaution, though there's no indication your online account was compromised. Also, please review your statements for the past 90 days and report any other unfamiliar transactions.
100. You're very welcome. I've added a fraud alert note to your account that will remain active for 12 months. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your account security today?
101. Oh oh oh, I see what happened here. Let me, um, pull up your account real quick. What's the order number? Should be something like ORD and then some numbers.
102. Perfect, er, I've got it here—ORD-4829-TX91 for the Samsung tablet. And you're right, it it dropped by $47 this morning. Between you and me, they should really warn people when these sales are coming.
103. So the original price you paid was, um, $389.99, and now it's at $342.99. That's that's exactly $47 difference. Here's what I can do—technically we have a 14-day price protection window, which you're totally within.
104. Just the the difference, so you'd get $47 back. But, er, listen—I'm gonna check something for you because sometimes there's actually a promo code floating around that could stack with this. Give me just a sec.
105. No no no, definitely don't return it! That would be, um, such a hassle for you. Honestly? The system makes this way more complicated than it needs to be. Let me just just apply code MATCH15 here and... hmm, that's bringing your refund to $54.
106. Right, so it's it's kind of backwards—the code gives you an extra 15% on top of the price difference. I know, uh, it makes zero sense but hey, more money back for you, right? The total credit will be $54.07.
107. Exactly, er, which brings your final cost down to $335.92. And between you and me? That's actually $7 better than today's sale price. Sometimes these these little glitches work in your favor.
108. The credit? Oh it'll show up in, um, 3 to 5 business days. I'm putting a note on your account—reference number REF-2847-PM—just in case there's any hiccup. Though honestly? These usually process faster, like 2 days max.
109. Ah no, that that reference number is just for tracking this specific refund. But, er, since you asked—we do have price protection on basically everything except clearance items. Code SAVE20 works on accessories through Friday if you need anything else.
110. That's it! You'll get an email confirmation in about, um, 10 minutes with all the details. And honestly? You handled this perfectly—most people don't even know we do price matching. Your $54.07 credit is all set.
111. Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear that! Let me pull up your account right away—what's the... hmm, the card number ending in?
112. Got it, account ending in 4782, I'm seeing it now. Okay so there's a charge for $89.99 at something called "GameVault Digital," then $156.00 at "TechnoMart Online," and uh... wait, there's another one for $234.50 at "ElectroHub Pro." Are these the ones?
113. I totally understand how frustrating this must be. Let me start the dispute process right away—I'll need to assign case number FRD-2847-XK to this, and um, first thing, have you still got physical possession of your card?
114. Hmm, that does make it interesting—probably an online breach then. So what I'm gonna do is freeze this card immediately with security code HALT-8829, issue you a new one, and er... the new card will be express shipped, arrival tracking XPS-44921-B.
115. Oh absolutely, I hear you! The express shipping I mentioned, that's actually overnight delivery—you'll have it by 10 AM tomorrow, guaranteed with that tracking XPS-44921-B.
116. No no, please don't apologize! This happened to me last year actually—someone bought like $400 worth of, get this, bird supplies? I don't even have a bird! But seriously, we'll get this sorted, and those three charges will be credited back within 24-48 hours under claim CLM-7736-RC.
117. Right? Like what were they planning, opening a pet store? Anyway, um, let me just... make sure everything's set here. Your new card ending in 9903 ships tonight, and I'm adding a security alert flag SAF-1122 to your account.
118. Correct, you're fully protected! Those fraudulent charges totaling $480.49 will be reversed, reference number REV-8827-TM, and you won't be responsible for a single penny.
119. Perfect! Oh, one more thing—I'm setting up text alerts with code TXT-ALRT-5566 so you'll get notified instantly for any transaction over $50. Would that help give you some peace of mind?
120. Are you kidding? You were totally fine! I'd be frustrated too if someone was out there pretending to be a twelve-year-old gamer with my credit card. Your case FRD-2847-XK is all set, and seriously, call us anytime if you need anything else, okay?
121. Oh gosh, double charged after cancelling? That's, um, definitely not right. Let me pull up your account here... hmm, can you give me the reservation number or the email you used?
122. No worries at all, take your time. Let me see here... okay so I'm searching for RES-4472 and, uh, I'm seeing a few options. Was this for a hotel stay around December 15th through the 18th?
123. Right right, I see exactly what happened here. So your cancellation was processed on November 30th at 3:47 PM, but then, errm, there's this weird thing where our system charged you $287.50 on December 1st and then again on December 3rd for the same amount.
124. I know, this is completely unacceptable. Honestly, looking at your account history, you've been with us since 2019, never had any issues before, so, um, what I'm gonna do is not just refund both charges immediately, but I'm also adding a $50 credit for this hassle.
125. Oh absolutely, so the refunds will show as pending within, hmm, let me check the exact timeframe... okay, within 2 to 4 hours, and they'll fully clear by Thursday morning at the latest, well before your Friday due date.
126. Ah man, I'm really sorry to hear that. Let me see if... actually, you know what? Since this whole experience has been frustrating, I'm upgrading you to our platinum status for the next 6 months, which gives you free cancellations on any future bookings.
127. Yep, zero fees, cancel anytime up to, uh, 24 hours before check-in. Your new member number is PLT-8827-MK6, and honestly, after what you've dealt with, it's the least we can do.
128. Mmm-hmm, processing as we speak. Your confirmation numbers are REF-92847-A for the first charge and, er, REF-92847-B for the second, both for $287.50, totaling $575.00 back to your card ending in 4429.
129. Exactly. Though honestly? Based on how our system's running today, I'd, uhh, guess you'll probably see them by tonight. But Thursday morning is the absolute latest, guaranteed.
130. Hey, that's what I'm here for. Oh, and just so you know, I've added a note to your account about this whole situation, so if you need to book with us again and run into any issues, just reference case number CSE-7703-NK and any agent will see the full history. Take care, alright?
131. Thank you for calling about your account. Let me access your file immediately. May I have your account number or the last four digits of your card?
132. Thank you. I've located your account ending in 7829, and I can see the adjustment was processed on November 14th through our automated risk assessment system AR-2024-1147. Let me review the specific factors that triggered this change.
133. You're absolutely right about your payment history. The system flagged a combination of factors including a credit utilization increase to 87% across all tradelines reported to bureau file CBR-445892-Q and two recent hard inquiries within thirty days.
134. I completely understand your concern, and you make a valid point about mortgage shopping being responsible financial behavior. Let me escalate this to our credit review department for manual reconsideration under case number CRV-2024-88451.
135. Certainly. The credit review team typically completes their analysis within 3-5 business days, and you'll receive a detailed decision letter via secure message to your online account portal at message center ID MC-7829-001.
136. The current limit of eight thousand will remain in effect during the review period. However, I can add priority flag PF-EXEC-2024 to expedite the process to 24-48 hours given your excellent account history.
137. Absolutely. Providing your mortgage pre-approval letters and recent pay stubs through our secure upload portal at reference URL portal.card.com/upload/CRV-2024-88451 would significantly support your case, particularly if they show stable or increased income.
138. Yes, you can call our priority service line at 800-555-2847 extension 4429 and reference your case number CRV-2024-88451 for immediate status updates without any hold time.
139. The review team will evaluate for full restoration to fifteen thousand dollars, and based on your profile code PC-PREMIUM-7829, you may actually qualify for an increase up to twenty thousand if your debt-to-income ratio supports it.
140. You're very welcome. I've documented everything in your case file, added the priority flag, and you'll receive a confirmation email within the hour to address 7829@email.confirmed with all reference numbers and next steps outlined.
141. Good afternoon, and thank you for calling. I'll be happy to review your account and discuss your options. May I have your account number or the phone number associated with your service?
142. Thank you. I have your account here, showing you've been on our PRO50 promotional plan since November 15, 2023, which expires November 14, 2024, next Thursday.
143. Excellent question. Eligibility depends on three primary factors: your payment history, which I can see is perfect with zero late payments in 24 months, your service tier, and current promotional inventory in your area code 94105.
144. Certainly. Based on your tenure and excellent payment record, I can offer you our loyalty rate of $65 monthly for 12 months under plan code LOY65-2024, or our current new customer promotion at $55 for 6 months.
145. New customers currently receive $45 monthly for their first 12 months on plan NEW45-Q4. After your loyalty rate expires, you would transition to our standard rate of $90, though you could call to review available promotions at that time.
146. I understand your position. Let me check our retention offers. I'm seeing a special loyalty override code RET55-VIP that would give you $55 monthly for 18 months, available only for customers with 5-plus years of service.
147. Of course. The RET55-VIP rate requires maintaining autopay, which you already have active, and includes your current 300 Mbps speed with no service downgrades. There are no additional fees or contract obligations beyond the promotional period.
148. I can apply it immediately. The promotional rate will begin on November 15, 2024, seamlessly continuing from your current promotion, and remain active through May 14, 2026.
149. Absolutely. I'm processing the rate change now, confirmation number CNF-847291-RT. You'll receive an email confirmation within 30 minutes to your registered email address, and an updated service agreement will arrive within 2 business days.
150. No action required on your part. Your November 15th bill will automatically reflect the new $55 rate. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your account today?
151. Certainly, I'll help clarify your billing cycle. Let me pull up your account details. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your subscription?
152. Thank you. I have your account here, showing you enrolled on October 7th at 2:15 PM Eastern. Your billing cycle runs monthly from the 7th of each month, with charges processing between midnight and 3:00 AM.
153. That's correct. Your subscription automatically renews on the 7th of each month for $89.99. If the 7th falls on a weekend, the charge still processes that day as our billing system runs 365 days a year.
154. Of course.
155. I see the issue now. The November 3rd charge of $89.99 was actually a prorated adjustment. When you upgraded from Basic to Premium on November 3rd, we charged the $40.00 difference for the remaining days in your October billing period.
156. Your next regular charge will be December 7th at approximately 12:30 AM Eastern for the full Premium amount of $89.99. This will cover service from December 7th through January 6th, 2024.
157. Absolutely. I'll email a detailed billing history to jennifer.chen at techglobal dot com within the next 10 minutes. This report will show all transactions from October 7th forward, including dates, amounts, and service periods covered.
158. Yes, we can adjust your billing date. Available dates are the 1st, 7th, 15th, or 22nd of each month. Changing to a new date would create a one-time prorated charge or credit depending on whether you're moving the date forward or back.
159. Moving from the 7th to the 15th would extend your current period by 8 days. You'd see a prorated charge of $23.99 on December 7th to cover December 7th through 14th, then regular billing of $89.99 would begin January 15th.
160. You're very welcome. I've noted our discussion in your account dated November 21st at 3:47 PM. If you have any future billing questions, please reference case number BLL-2847-JC for faster service.
161. Oh my goodness, um, that's definitely not—I mean that's concerning. Let me pull up your account right away here, can you give me your order number or, uh, actually your email would work too?
162. Yes this call is being recorded for quality purposes, but er, don't worry about that—I really need to document this safety issue. Your email is sarah.chen at—sorry, what comes after the at sign?
163. Yes absolutely unplug it right now if you haven't already, um, and please keep it away from anything flammable. I found your account—order BLD-4492-XK7 from October 12th, and I can see it's the ProBlend 3000, is that right?
164. So I'm checking our system here and, hmm, I don't see any active recalls but this is—no wait, I mean, this is definitely serious. What I need to do is file an urgent product safety report with reference number PSR-2024-11-8934.
165. I understand your frustration, really, and uh, I wish I had more immediate answers but here's what I can do right now—I'm processing a full refund of $127.89 and I'm also, er, flagging this for our safety team to call you within 24 hours.
166. No no, definitely dispose of it safely—actually, sorry, don't throw it in regular trash. Our safety team will arrange a special pickup, but for now just, um, maybe put it outside? Away from the house? The callback number they'll use is 1-800-SAFETY-9, that's 1-800-723-3899.
167. Anywhere that's, uh, what's the word... non-combustible? Like concrete or, er, actually your driveway would be perfect. I'm adding a priority flag to your case number CSE-94-2287-B so you'll definitely get that call tomorrow.
168. They'll collect it for testing, yes, and hmm, they usually offer compensation for the inconvenience—I can't promise an exact amount but typically it's around, let me check... looks like a $50 credit on top of your refund.
169. I know it doesn't really—I mean, I understand fifty dollars doesn't make up for this experience. Let me see if I can... actually, hold on, I'm adding a manager override code MGR-OVERRIDE-7732 for an additional $75 credit, so that's $125 total compensation.
170. The refund will process in 3-5 business days to your original payment method, and er, you'll get an email confirmation at sarah.chen@gmail.com within the next hour with all these reference numbers—PSR-2024-11-8934 for the safety report and CSE-94-2287-B for your case.
171. Oh no—I'm so—let me pull that up. Account ending in 4782? I see you referred, um, three people last month. That should've triggered the fifty dollar credit.
172. That's—no that's not right at all. I can see why—hmm, wait. Your referral code REF-KMXY-9021 shows active but the credits are stuck in, uh, pending status since October 15th.
173. You did! You absolutely—let me just—sorry. This happens sometimes with our system. I'm gonna manually push these through right now, reference ticket TK-890234.
174. It won't—I promise—actually no, I'm fixing it. Right now. Just processed the first one, transaction ID TX-5567-AAB2.
175. Already am! Second credit just—there we go—posted. That's, er, another fifty, transaction TX-5568-AAB2. God, I hate when our system does this to people.
176. Oh I get it—trust me—final one processing. There! All three credits, total one-fifty, should hit your account within, um, two to four hours max.
177. Today. Absolutely today. I've also—hang on—added a courtesy credit. Twenty-five dollars for the hassle, confirmation CC-7829-XM.
178. Course I did! You referred—actually wait—three friends! That's huge. We should be thanking you.
179. Exactly. One-seventy-five. I put a rush flag on it too, priority code RUSH-4499, so honestly? Probably gonna hit in like an hour.
180. Good! And hey—I put a note—your next referral? Double bonus. My direct line's 555-0147 extension 882 if you need anything.
181. Let me pull up your account here. I've got your billing statement from October 15th showing a total of $127.43, and I can definitely break down each charge for you.
182. That $127.43 is your final total including all taxes and fees. So starting from the top, your base service plan is $79.99, then you've got the equipment rental at $12.00 per month.
183. So after your base and equipment, there's a regional sports fee of $9.95, and then a broadcast TV surcharge of $14.99, bringing your subtotal to $116.93 before taxes.
184. Unfortunately the regional sports fee is, um... it's part of the standard package structure in your area, ZIP code 94122. It's not something we can remove individually from accounts.
185. You're asking great questions actually. The remaining $10.50 breaks down into state tax at $5.83, local utility tax at $2.89, and a federal regulatory fee of $1.78.
186. I'm generating a detailed PDF breakdown right now with document ID DOC-4429-BX that'll show every charge with descriptions. Should hit your email at the address ending in 7@gmail.com within about two minutes.
187. This particular document shows just October's charges, but I can also enable detailed billing going forward so every statement will have this level of, uh... what's the word... granularity, this breakdown for each line item.
188. I've activated enhanced billing details effective immediately. You'll see this format starting with your November 1st statement, and it'll include comparison charts showing any changes from the previous month.
189. That $127.43 is absolutely your complete total. No hidden fees, no separate charges. Everything flows through that single monthly statement on the 15th of each month.
190. Not basic at all—billing transparency is really important. That PDF should be in your inbox now, and if you need any clarification on future statements, reference number SR-9847-TK2 will link back to today's detailed breakdown.
191. Good afternoon, and thank you for reaching out. I'd be happy to help you with this situation. Let me pull up our return options for you. May I have your order number or the email address associated with your purchase?
192. Thank you for providing that information. I'm looking at order ORD-8847-QM now, which shows a Dell Inspiron laptop purchased on October 12th for $849.99. You're correct that our standard return window closed on November 11th. Let me review what options we have available for you.
193. I completely understand, and I appreciate you sharing that detail. Since the item remains unopened and it's only been 42 days since purchase, I can submit an exception request to our returns team. These requests typically have a high approval rate for unopened electronics within 60 days of purchase.
194. I'll need to document a few details for case number RET-2847-NPQ. First, can you confirm the laptop is still in its original sealed packaging with all manufacturer seals intact?
195. Excellent. That significantly helps your case. I'm noting that in your file now under exception code EXC-471. The returns team will review this within 24 to 48 hours, and you'll receive an email at the address ending in gmail.com that we have on file.
196. Certainly not. Given the circumstances and the item's unopened status, I'm pre-authorizing a prepaid return label under shipping code SHP-9821-FREE. If approved, the return label will be included in your approval email at no cost to you.
197. I understand your concern. While I'm confident about approval given the circumstances, if for any reason it isn't approved, you'll receive a callback from our escalation team to discuss alternatives. We might explore options like store credit valued at $935.00, which includes a 10% courtesy addition, or an extended manufacturer warranty transfer.
198. Absolutely. I can process that immediately if you prefer. The store credit of $935.00 would be issued as code CRD-4477-LAPTOP and would be valid for 24 months from today's date. It can be used for any items on our website or in our retail locations.
199. Perfect. I'm processing that now. You'll receive an email within 15 minutes containing store credit code CRD-4477-LAPTOP for $935.00. Once you receive it, you can initiate the return using prepaid label RMA-7749-QMX, which I'm generating simultaneously.
200. You're very welcome. I'm glad we could find a solution that works well for you. Your return kit will arrive within 2-3 business days, and your credit is already being processed. Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding this order or any other concerns?
201. Oh, well, I thought the acoustics would be interesting for, um, demonstrating some pragmatic principles. Plus, honestly, the department's conference rooms were all booked and this place has a certain... atmospheric quality that really emphasizes how context shapes meaning.
202. Ha! Yeah, someone spray-painted them last semester during that whole, uh, protest about funding cuts. The Cooperative Principle right there next to "DOWN WITH ADMIN" is actually kind of perfect—it's like a real-world violation of the Maxim of Relation, you know?
203. Mmm, probably? I mean, the structural engineers cleared it last month for that art installation. Anyway, let's talk about Austin's speech act theory—see how this dusty old space affects our illocutionary force when we're, like, constantly worried about tetanus.
204. Right, so, imagine you're Paul Grice giving a lecture in here versus, say, at Oxford. The implicatures change completely because the context is so radically different—your audience would interpret everything through this lens of, um, abandonment and decay.
205. [stuttering] N-no, that's just the— the building settling, it does that. Look, Searle's taxonomy of illocutionary acts actually becomes really interesting in spaces like this because our commissives and expressives take on this whole different weight.
206. Essentially, yeah. The way deixis works here is fascinating—when I say "here" or "now" in this space, it carries all these, uh, additional pragmatic layers that wouldn't exist in a normal classroom setting, you know?
207. Oh right, sorry. But actually, that's perfect for discussing Levinson's work on presumptive meanings—we're both presuming certain things about safety and, like, appropriateness just based on these environmental cues that have nothing to do with actual language.
208. We're not— okay, we're kind of trespassing. But think about it: Horn's division of pragmatic labor is happening right now in how we're choosing our words more carefully because the setting makes everything feel, mmm, more consequential somehow.
209. Yikes, probably. But hey, even that affects our conversational implicatures—like when Sperber and Wilson talk about relevance theory, the presence of, er, potential danger makes every utterance feel more loaded with meaning.
210. [speeding up] Yes absolutely, let's go, we can grab coffee and I'll explain how Goffman's face theory works way better when you're not worried about asbestos, come on, there's a exit this way I think.
211. I can understand why that would be concerning. Let me take a look at what we're dealing with here—sometimes cracks look worse than they actually are, and I'll help you figure out exactly what needs to be done.
212. Based on what I'm seeing, these are settlement cracks, which are pretty common in homes this age. They're not structural, which is good news—your house isn't going to collapse or anything dramatic like that.
213. [laugh hysterically] Oh absolutely! Sorry, I just remembered this one homeowner who thought their hairline crack meant the whole house was sinking into the earth. These are totally fixable—we'll inject some polyurethane sealant, maybe do some minor grading work outside to redirect water flow.
214. For what you've got here, probably between two and four thousand dollars total. I know that sounds like a lot, but foundation work is one of those investments that really protects your home's value long-term.
215. Most people do! The internet makes every foundation crack sound like a catastrophe, but yours is really manageable. I've been doing this twenty years and I'd say seventy percent of the issues I see are like yours—totally fixable with basic maintenance.
216. The moisture is actually related to those cracks we talked about. Once we seal them up and improve the drainage, that dampness should clear right up—it's all part of the same water management system.
217. [sad] I am confident about your house, but I've seen too many people panic and sell at a loss over fixable problems. Your situation is genuinely not that bad, and I want you to feel secure about your home—it's still a good, solid structure.
218. We can get a crew out here as early as next Tuesday. The whole job should take maybe three days, and you won't even need to leave the house while we work—it's all exterior and basement access.
219. Oh, I completely understand that anxiety—your home is your biggest investment and your safe space. But truly, you can rest easy knowing this is routine maintenance, not a crisis, and we'll have it sorted out soon.
220. That's wonderful to hear! I'll email you a detailed report with photos and my recommendations, plus a list of contractors I trust if you don't want to use our crew—you've got options and everything's going to be just fine.
221. That's called awake craniotomy, and it's genuinely one of the most fascinating procedures in neurosurgery. They keep patients conscious so they can monitor speech and motor functions in real-time while removing tumors or treating epilepsy.
222. The brain itself doesn't have pain receptors, which sounds impossible but it's true. They numb the scalp with local anesthetic, and once they're through the skull, patients don't feel the actual brain manipulation at all.
223. The surgical team is incredibly prepared for that scenario. They have anesthesiologists who specialize in conscious sedation, and they can adjust medications instantly to calm anxiety while keeping the patient responsive enough for the necessary testing.
224. [very sad] I watched my mentor perform one about five years ago, actually. The patient was a concert pianist with a tumor near her motor cortex, and we had to make sure we didn't damage the areas controlling her finger movements.
225. She can, beautifully. We actually had her moving her fingers during the surgery while the surgeon stimulated different areas to map out exactly what controlled what. It's like creating a GPS map of someone's brain functions.
226. Years and years of practice, starting with suturing bananas and grapes in medical school. Plus, modern microsurgery uses stabilization equipment and microscopes that magnify everything up to forty times, so even the tiniest tremor becomes manageable.
227. Completely serious. The peel is delicate like skin tissue, and you have to learn not to bruise the fruit while stitching. Some programs use chicken breasts or pig feet too, but fruit is surprisingly effective for developing that initial gentle touch.
228. There was a separation of conjoined twins in Singapore that lasted 103 hours. Four days straight, with rotating teams of surgeons. The planning alone took months, creating 3D models of their shared brain tissue to figure out how to divide it.
229. Surgical teams rotate in and out, usually working in four to six hour shifts during marathon procedures. They have to maintain peak performance, so they build in rest periods, hydration breaks, and even have backup teams ready if someone gets fatigued.
230. [enunciating every word] Every single cut matters, every decision is permanent, and that weight never really leaves you. But when you save someone's life or restore their function, that feeling is absolutely incomparable to anything else in medicine.
231. Ha! Oh man, that's just the, um, the rotor warming up—totally normal, I promise. Though I get why it sounds like we're in a giant blender, but trust me, these things are built like tanks that happen to fly.
232. [belly laugh] Okay, so either he thinks he's in Top Gun, which, honestly, fair, or he's actually just, uh, really committed to the aesthetic—but hey, at least he's not wearing the aviator scarf too, right?
233. [chuckle] Oh that's not—well, okay, it IS duct tape, but it's, er, aerospace grade duct tape, which is basically the Swiss Army knife of aviation fixes. NASA uses it, so if it's good enough for space, it's definitely good enough for us hovering over downtown.
234. Hah, yeah, some pilots are, um, let's say "spiritually cautious"—but honestly I'd rather have one who's covering all the bases than one who's like, overconfident about defying gravity in a metal bubble.
235. [cough] Oof, yeah, those get, erm, a bit funky after hundreds of tourists—but think of it as, I don't know, building character? Or at least building immunity to whatever that smell actually is, which we've never quite figured out.
236. Oh it's, ah, it's brilliantly dual-purpose actually! Starts as a souvenir bag but can, you know, quickly transition to emergency use if someone gets a bit green—though honestly the logo placement becomes, mmm, pretty unfortunate at that point.
237. Sure, sure! I mean, there's only like, what, seventeen different controls you're monitoring simultaneously while basically doing calculus in your head about wind speed and, uh, not crashing into buildings—piece of cake, really!
238. Ahh, that's Captain Quackers, our, er, unofficial co-pilot! Every helicopter has one—it's supposedly for checking airflow or something technical, but really I think pilots just get lonely up here and need a friend who won't judge their landing technique.
239. Oh my god, yes! That happens, like, constantly now—nothing quite deflates the whole "marvel of human flight" thing like getting overtaken by some kid's Christmas present that probably cost less than our fuel for this trip.
240. Yeah, that's the, um, the pressure thing—try yawning really dramatically or pretend you're chewing gum, which sounds ridiculous but actually works. Or just scream, honestly, because between the rotors and the headsets, nobody's gonna hear you anyway!
241. Actually yes, my grandmother used to make us eat pickled herring on New Year's Eve for good luck. Though I should clarify—it wasn't just eating it, we had to eat exactly twelve pieces at midnight while making wishes.
242. Well, okay, they were tiny pieces, like thumbnail-sized. I made it sound worse than it was. She'd cut them up super small and serve them on these little crackers with cream cheese to make it bearable for us kids.
243. [delighted] Oh but that's the thing—when it's done right, pickled herring doesn't really taste fishy at all! It's more tangy and savory, almost like a really intense olive. Though I'll admit, the texture takes some getting used to.
244. Nothing dramatic, but my grandmother would get this look. Actually no, I'm misremembering—she'd just quietly mention how her mother did it through the Depression and two wars, which was way more effective than yelling would've been.
245. Right? Though honestly, looking back, I think she was just trying to keep the tradition alive. She'd lost so much of her culture immigrating here, and this was one small thing she could preserve and pass down.
246. I tried for a few years after she passed, but it felt hollow doing it alone. Wait, that's not entirely true—I did it once with my roommates in college, but they thought I was pranking them.
247. They really are. Although I should mention, the herring wasn't even the weirdest part. We also had to wear something red, keep coins in our pockets, and absolutely no cleaning on New Year's Day or you'd sweep away your luck.
248. Ha, you'd think so, but the anxiety of seeing dishes pile up was worse than just doing them. My grandmother would prep for days beforehand though, making sure everything was spotless by midnight so we wouldn't be tempted.
249. Absolutely. Well, no, obviously not in any measurable way. But those years felt luckier because we were all together, being ridiculous, making these elaborate wishes over tiny pieces of fish.
250. That's exactly it, actually. The herring was just an excuse to gather everyone in one room, to mark time passing, to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves. The fish was terrible, but the feeling was everything.
251. [very slowly] Yeah, we hit about two million concurrent viewers during last week's charity stream. Our servers basically had a meltdown around the ninety-minute mark, which was not ideal when we were trying to raise money for disaster relief.
252. Right? Last year our peak was maybe 400K, so we're talking five times the traffic. The infrastructure team keeps telling me we need to implement proper geographic distribution, but honestly the costs are getting pretty wild.
253. Honestly though, they might have a point this time. We're routing everything through three data centers right now, and when one goes down, the failover is taking like thirty seconds, which means thirty seconds of dead air for millions of people.
254. True, we're definitely not maximizing our current setup. The team wants to implement this thing called consistent hashing to distribute the load more evenly, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around how that actually works in practice.
255. [very meekly] Could you maybe explain it? I mean, I get the basic concept of distributing requests, but the whole hash ring thing and virtual nodes just makes my brain hurt sometimes.
256. [cough] Sorry, allergies. But yeah, that makes sense. The real challenge for us is that our audience is global but most of our infrastructure is US-based, so viewers in Asia and Europe get terrible latency.
257. We're using CloudFlare for static assets, which helps a lot. But for live streaming, you need those edge servers to be really close to viewers, and setting up proper Points of Presence in every major region is like a million-dollar project minimum.
258. [sigh] Yeah, you're probably right. The CFO nearly fainted when we showed her the AWS estimates for proper global coverage, and that's not even counting the engineering hours to set everything up correctly.
259. That's actually what we're planning. We're going to spin up infrastructure in Europe first since that's our second-biggest audience, test the load balancing between regions, see if we can get the latency under 50 milliseconds.
260. Exactly. Plus if we nail the Europe expansion, we can use that as a template for Asia-Pacific later, though honestly the Great Firewall situation in China is a whole other nightmare I'm not ready to think about yet.
261. The Mariana Trench, Challenger Deep specifically. We're talking nearly 36,000 feet down. The pressure there would crush most submarines like tin cans. Only three people have ever been to the bottom in person.
262. [anxious] Victor Vescovo in 2019. Before him it was just James Cameron in 2012 and then way back in 1960 you had Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh. Actually, wait, I should clarify—Vescovo's been down multiple times since then, but I meant three distinct expeditions with people.
263. [very melancholic] That would be the International Space Station. Around 150 billion dollars, give or take. It's kind of beautiful and sad at the same time, you know? All that money floating above us while we've got problems down here.
264. About 17,500 miles per hour. It completes an orbit every 90 minutes, so the astronauts see sixteen sunrises and sunsets every single day. Can you imagine trying to maintain a sleep schedule with that?
265. Depends who you ask, but a lot of chefs say soufflé. It's all timing—one wrong move and it collapses. You need precise temperature control and absolutely no sudden movements. Some argue for consommé though, that perfectly clear soup that takes hours of patience.
266. Nobody really knows for certain. Leading theory is memory consolidation—your brain sorting through the day's experiences, filing away what's important. But that doesn't explain why dreams are so bizarre, does it? Some think it's just random neural firing that our brains desperately try to make sense of.
267. Mayflies. Some species live literally 24 hours as adults. They emerge, mate, lay eggs, and die, all in a single day. Though technically they live longer as aquatic nymphs beforehand, sometimes years, but we don't count that part for some reason.
268. [frustrated] Tons of them! The whole ultraviolet and infrared spectrums are invisible to us. Mantis shrimp see sixteen types of color receptors compared to our measly three. We're basically colorblind compared to them, which is honestly kind of humbling when you think about it.
269. [frustrated] Pando, this massive clonal colony of quaking aspen in Utah. It's one organism with a shared root system, estimated at 80,000 years old. Though some people argue for certain bacteria or those ancient bristlecone pines. Depends how you define "thing" and "living," which gets philosophical fast.
270. Impossible to count precisely. English alone has maybe 170,000 words in current use, but that's just in dictionaries. New words appear constantly, old ones die, and then you've got technical jargon, slang, regional variants. Language is alive, always changing, never quite pinned down.
271. Oh no, not weird at all! I actually love talking about candy—it's one of those subjects where everyone has really strong opinions but nobody gets actually mad, you know?
272. Mmm, that's fair. I mean, we all probably eat more sugar than we should, but honestly life's too short to completely deprive yourself of the things that make you happy, right?
273. Ooh, that's actually pretty insightful. Food and emotions are so intertwined—like, there's comfort eating, celebration eating, stress eating... it's all really normal human stuff, though I guess being aware of it is the first step.
274. Oh man, definitely! I'm a total sucker for those sour gummy things—you know, the ones that make your face scrunch up but then you immediately want another one? There's something weirdly addictive about that sweet-sour combo.
275. Boring? No way! Chocolate is like the foundation of the candy pyramid—it's classic for a reason, and honestly there's so much variety within chocolate itself that calling it boring is kind of impossible.
276. [child-like] Aww, that sounds like it was really special! Me and my brother used to trade Halloween candy for hours, making these elaborate deals like we were, um, tiny stockbrokers or something—those are such good memories.
277. [very quietly] That's... yeah, that's really hard. Distance doesn't have to mean the connection is gone though—sometimes those shared memories, even the silly candy ones, they're like little bridges you can walk back across when you're ready.
278. Hey, no no no, don't apologize! We started talking about candy but really we're talking about, like, memories and relationships and that's totally valid—candy's just the vehicle, you know?
279. Oh gosh, that's actually such a sweet idea! It's like a little "thinking of you" gesture without having to find the perfect words—sometimes a box of nostalgic candy says more than a long text ever could.
280. Honestly? Even if it feels random at first, the fact that you remembered something you shared, that you took the time to do something thoughtful—that's what really matters, and I bet she'll understand exactly what you're trying to say.
281. [whispering loudly] Oh jeez, okay, we're doing this? Look, I'm gonna tell you something that could, erhm, probably get me fired, but you need to hear it—the ESOP here is basically a trap, alright?
282. Well, so they make it sound amazing, right? Like, "own a piece of the company," but honestly the vesting schedule is brutal—five years before you get anything, and if you leave even one day early, poof, it's all gone.
283. Sure, yeah, except here's the thing they don't tell you—the shares are valued by, mmm, their own internal committee, not market rate, so you could be sitting on worthless paper for years without knowing it.
284. Technically? I mean, yeah, it's legal, but ethically it's, oof, it's pretty questionable. Plus they can dilute your shares anytime they want by issuing new ones to executives, which happens literally every quarter.
285. Woof, okay, so I had about 80k worth on paper two years ago, and now after three dilutions it's worth maybe, uhh, 22k? And that's if their valuations are even honest, which, honestly, I doubt.
286. [gasp softly] Wait, you haven't signed up yet? Oh thank god, listen, there's actually something else—they're planning a massive restructuring next month that nobody's supposed to know about.
287. No no no, don't! Look, I'm seriously risking my job here, but after the restructuring, those stock options are gonna be worth, like, basically nothing—they're converting to a different class of shares entirely.
288. [confused] Because I... wait, you really don't know who I am? I'm on the compensation committee, or well, I was until I started asking too many questions about the ESOP structure.
289. Yeah well, someone needs to warn people, right? They've already screwed over, hmm, probably sixty employees this year alone, and HR just keeps pushing the program like it's some golden ticket or something.
290. [jealous] Honestly? Just max out your 401k and buy index funds like everyone smart does—my brother did that instead and he's already retired at 45, meanwhile I'm stuck with worthless paper promises.
291. Oh gosh, not at all! I mean, wine collecting is actually one of the most, er, magnificent investments you can make—both culturally and financially, you know? Like, when you hold a bottle of, say, a 1982 Château Latour, you're literally holding liquid history in your hands, which is, honestly, quite extraordinary when you really think about it.
292. [yawn] Well, see, entry-level collecting can start around, mm, five thousand or so for a decent starter cellar, but the real treasures—oh man, we're talking tens of thousands per bottle. I actually just sanctioned the purchase of a, uh, remarkable 1945 Romanée-Conti for a client last week, and that was, gosh, north of half a million, which sounds insane but it's basically buying a piece of art.
293. Ah, but think about it this way—these bottles are, like, rarer than most diamonds, and frankly, they offer something diamonds never could: the promise of an absolutely transcendent experience when you finally, you know, decide to open them. Plus, I mean, the appreciation rates on premier crus have been, er, consistently outperforming the stock market for decades now.
294. Mmm, both, actually! The trick is to buy, ideally, three bottles of everything—one to drink young to understand its potential, one for that perfect moment of maturity, and one to, uh, keep forever as an investment. Though honestly, some of my clients have cellars worth more than their houses, which is, you know, absolutely their prerogative and I fully endorse it.
295. Oh man, last year I orchestrated this, um, absolutely divine vertical tasting of Pétrus going back to 1961—we're talking about roughly two million dollars worth of wine consumed in one evening, but the joy on their faces? Priceless, truly. And, I mean, when you have that level of wealth, why not sanctify life's precious moments with something equally precious, right?
296. Guilty? Gosh, no, never—I see myself as, erhm, facilitating these sublime experiences that, frankly, elevate the human spirit beyond the mundane. When I approve these purchases, I'm essentially giving people permission to, you know, touch greatness, to taste history, to own something genuinely magnificent that'll outlive them.
297. Well okay, see, my clients are actually incredibly philanthropic—they just happen to also appreciate the, er, finer things. And honestly, the wine industry employs millions globally, from vineyard workers to sommeliers, so when I sanction these purchases, I'm, mm, supporting an entire ecosystem of craftsmanship and tradition that's been refined over centuries.
298. Oh absolutely, counterfeits are, ugh, rampant in this world—that's why having someone like me to authenticate and, you know, officially sanction purchases is crucial. I've saved clients from, erhm, catastrophic mistakes, bottles that looked perfect but were actually clever forgeries worth nothing, which would've been, frankly, devastating both financially and emotionally.
299. Hah, well, beyond the Master of Wine certification, which took me, gosh, five years of absolute dedication, you need this, um, innate sense of taste, an encyclopedic knowledge of vintages and terroirs, and most importantly, the confidence to, er, authorize purchases that cost more than most people's annual salaries—it's not for the faint of heart, I can tell you that.
300. [bored] Hey, look, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that—honestly, some of those bottles are, mm, perfectly serviceable for everyday drinking. But if you ever want to experience something truly transcendent, something that'll, you know, fundamentally change how you understand pleasure itself, well, that's when you come to someone like me for, er, proper guidance and sanctioning.
301. Hear ye, hear ye! Indeed I am, and, uhh, today's proclamation concerns the inverted yield curve phenomenon wherein short-term Treasury securities are, er, actually yielding higher returns than long-term bonds, which historically presages economic recession within twelve to eighteen months!
302. Ah, so the yield curve represents the, mmm, relationship between interest rates and time to maturity for debt securities of equal credit quality—basically when you plot Treasury yields from three-month bills all the way to thirty-year bonds, it should slope upward but, gosh, right now it's doing the opposite!
303. [crying while speaking] Because, citizens of the realm, when banks can't profit from the spread between short-term borrowing costs and long-term lending rates, credit creation essentially, uhh, freezes up, leading to reduced capital expenditure, declining velocity of money, and ultimately deflationary pressures that destroy wealth!
304. [bored] Look, the Federal Open Market Committee has been implementing quantitative tightening at a pace of ninety-five billion per month, reducing system liquidity while simultaneously maintaining the federal funds rate at, er, restrictive levels, creating this kind of... dual pressure on both monetary aggregates and term premiums.
305. [curious] Ooh, have you perhaps heard about basis points? Because when we discuss the spread between two-year and ten-year Treasuries currently sitting at negative forty basis points, we're actually witnessing, hmm, a massive repricing of duration risk across the entire fixed income complex!
306. Right so, one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point, and, uhh, professional traders use this metric to discuss minute yield changes because when you're dealing with billions in notional value, even five basis points can mean millions in profit or, er, catastrophic losses!
307. Alright, imagine the term structure of interest rates as, mmm, a mathematical function where each point represents the, uh, present value of future cash flows discounted at the risk-free rate plus various premiums for inflation expectations, liquidity preference, and convexity adjustments!
308. Ah yes, convexity measures the, err, second derivative of bond price with respect to yield—essentially how the duration changes as rates move, which becomes critically important when hedging mortgage-backed securities because prepayment risk creates negative convexity that, uhh, amplifies losses during rate volatility!
309. Nay, good citizen! These concepts like duration matching, immunization strategies, and, hmm, butterfly spreads are fundamental to understanding how pension funds and insurance companies manage their asset-liability mismatches in a world of, er, constantly shifting interest rate expectations and credit spreads!
310. Well, honestly, most retail investors should probably just, uhh, dollar-cost average into diversified index funds tracking the S&P 500 or total market indices, because attempting to time credit cycles or predict yield curve movements is, I mean, essentially impossible even for sophisticated institutional investors with Bloomberg terminals!
311. I start with forgetting everything. Every assumption, every pattern—gone. Then I watch real humans struggle with existing solutions and document their micro-frustrations; those tiny moments where their eyes narrow or fingers hesitate.
312. Time is irrelevant when you're architecting cognitive flow. Most designers rush to pixels; I map neural pathways first. Each click should feel inevitable, like your brain predicted it before your finger moved.
313. They design for themselves—clever people solving problems cleverly. But users aren't designers; they're exhausted parents at 11pm trying to pay bills. They need interfaces that think for them, not with them.
314. [long pause] Password requirements. We force users to create complex passwords they'll forget, then shame them for writing them down. Real security isn't complexity; it's designing systems that align with human memory patterns—phrases, not P@$$w0rd123!
315. Security theater compromises security. A twenty-word passphrase someone remembers beats an eight-character nightmare they tape to their monitor. The interface should guide them toward naturally strong choices without friction.
316. Not toddlers—tired. Everyone's cognitively exhausted by 3pm. If your interface requires active thinking, you've already failed. Great design disappears; it feels like the computer reads your mind.
317. Not impossible—invisible. Watch someone use Instagram; their thumb moves before conscious thought engages. That's not luck; it's thousands of iterations creating muscle memory. The interface trained their brain without permission.
318. All great design is manipulation. The question isn't whether you're controlling behavior—you are—it's whether you're doing it ethically. Are you helping them accomplish goals or exploiting dopamine loops for engagement metrics?
319. I design backwards from regret. Will someone feel good about this interaction tomorrow? Next month? If they'd be embarrassed explaining their usage pattern to a friend, I've built something predatory.
320. It should be. We're programming human behavior at scale; every modal, every notification, every loading animation shapes how millions think. That's either a responsibility or a weapon—designers choose which.
321. [angry] Look, this is exactly the kind of thing that drives me up the wall—you have to document everything, every single absence, because HR won't let you do anything without a paper trail. It's so frustrating when you know someone's gaming the system but you can't just, like, call them out on it.
322. Oh absolutely, I mean, the creativity is almost impressive sometimes. You get the sudden flu, the car that mysteriously breaks down every Saturday, the, um, family emergency that somehow only happens during peak hours—after fifteen years in retail, I've heard them all.
323. [sniffle] That's... that's the hardest part, honestly. Because sometimes they really are going through stuff, and you don't want to be that manager who, you know, assumes the worst about everyone when someone's genuinely struggling.
324. Mmm, we used to, but corporate changed it to this whole progressive discipline thing now. First it's a verbal warning, then written, then final written, and only then can you actually, uh, move toward termination—it takes literally months.
325. Ooh, yeah, that's... that's technically retaliation and can get you in serious trouble. HR hammered that into us during the last training—you can't reduce hours as punishment, even though, honestly, it would solve so many problems.
326. Woof, some days I really don't, if I'm being honest. But then you get that one employee who actually wants to grow, who shows up early and asks questions, and it kind of, I guess, reminds you why you started doing this.
327. Um, constantly, actually—the money's better, the hours are normal, no dealing with customers. But there's something about being on the floor, solving problems in real-time, that I'd probably miss, you know?
328. [sneeze] Oh god, Black Friday two years ago—three people with the flu, two no-shows, and my assistant manager's car actually did break down. I was literally on the floor for eighteen hours straight, running between registers and the stockroom like a maniac.
329. Ha! They sent a, uh, congratulations email about hitting sales targets, no mention of the skeleton crew that made it happen. That's retail for you—they see numbers, not the chaos behind them.
330. [empathetically] Hmm, you know, despite everything I've just said, I think I would—but only if they understand it's not just about products and sales. It's really about people, and if you can't find meaning in developing your team and, like, genuinely helping customers, you'll burn out fast.
331. That sounds really overwhelming. Is this your first time presenting at something this big, or have you done smaller conferences before?
332. [cry] Oh, I completely understand that jump in scale feeling terrifying. What's your presentation about? Sometimes talking through the content helps calm those pre-conference nerves.
333. Your expertise will definitely shine through even if your voice wavers a bit. Have you thought about doing a practice run with friends? Most conference audiences are actually really supportive—they want you to succeed.
334. [gasp] Wait, is your advisor Dr. Peterson? I heard she's presenting at the same conference! But seriously, overthinking is so common with first-time presenters—what specific part worries you most?
335. That's the number one fear I hear from everyone. Here's what saved me: it's completely fine to say "That's a fascinating question, I haven't explored that angle yet." People respect honesty way more than fumbled attempts at answers.
336. I literally forgot my entire second slide and stood there frozen for what felt like hours. But you know what? The audience was incredibly kind, someone cracked a joke about coffee not kicking in yet, and I recovered.
337. It was, but it taught me that conference audiences are mostly fellow researchers who've been exactly where you are. Have you connected with anyone else presenting in your session? Sometimes having a friendly face helps.
338. [cry] That's wonderful! Having even one ally in the room changes everything. When I presented at AGU last year, knowing just two people in that massive ballroom made such a difference to my confidence.
339. Around four hundred, but honestly after the first minute you stop seeing individual faces and it becomes easier. What time slot did you get for your presentation? Morning sessions tend to be more forgiving.
340. Perfect timing actually—everyone will be too focused on their coffee to judge harshly! Plus early sessions mean you can enjoy the rest of the conference without that weight on your shoulders. Are you planning to attend the networking reception?
341. Oh, um, one twenty-eight miles per hour at peak—but honestly, my graduate student Sarah was the one who pointed out that speed alone doesn't tell the whole story. She ran these simulations showing it's actually the acceleration profile that, like, really matters here. Zero to one-twenty in three and a half seconds.
342. Well, not violently—my colleague Dr. Chen always says "precisely engineered," and he's right. Every millisecond of that launch sequence, um, it's based on research from the aerospace guys down the hall actually. They showed us how to distribute G-forces exactly where the human body handles them best.
343. Oh absolutely, yeah. The safety protocol we use was developed by this brilliant team in Germany—they insist on more checks than commercial aircraft require. My post-doc, Marcus, he's the one who implemented the ten thousand diagnostic points, and, uh, Professor Williams contributed the triple-redundant hydraulic system design.
344. Mmm, fair point. Look, the inspection standards come from NASA contractors—not my idea, they've been doing this for decades. Every weld gets x-rayed twice because, um, that's what the Swiss team recommended after their studies. The control system running predictive failure analysis? That's Dr. Patel's algorithm.
345. Oh! The heartline roll. Actually, I have to credit Anton Schwarzkopf's original theories from the seventies, though we, uh, we refined them significantly. My team spent six months on it because, like, the math for rotating around center of mass instead of geometric center is just brutal.
346. [friendly] Ah, that's actually my favorite part! A student named Jake proposed these acoustic resonance chambers in the support structure. Really clever kid—he figured out how compressed air could release at specific frequencies as the train passes, creating this, um, psychological amplification effect.
347. Well, it's more like—okay, there's this researcher at MIT who calls it "calibrated emotional architecture," which I think is brilliant. Fear, exhilaration, relief—the timing comes from, uh, decades of industry data. That 1.3-second weightlessness window? Disney's engineers discovered that sweet spot back in the nineties.
348. Oh god, yes. The vertical drop prototype especially. My mentor always said you should feel terror looking at your own work—means you're pushing boundaries, right? Standing there, even knowing the calculations were perfect, I mean, my stomach just dropped.
349. Seventy-three times that first day, yeah. The testing protocol comes from, um, Japanese manufacturers actually—they insist designers personally verify every sensation. My colleague Maria thought I was insane, but like, you can't simulate human experience with equations alone.
350. Hah, well, management said exactly that. But honestly, the Italian designers I studied under, they taught me that perfection demands this kind of, uh, personal investment. You have to strap yourself in and feel every imperfection—that's not my philosophy, that's just industry wisdom passed down for generations.
351. Cats. The 2019 version with the CGI fur. I went opening night because I thought it would be campy-bad, you know, fun-bad, but it was just deeply unsettling watching James Corden as a cat-human hybrid for two hours while my brain tried to process what my eyes were seeing.
352. [child-like] Not only did I stay, I dragged my best friend back to see it again the next week because I needed someone else to confirm I hadn't hallucinated the entire experience. We spent the whole second viewing just whispering "what is happening" to each other every five minutes.
353. The thing is, I have this theory that truly awful movies are actually more memorable than mediocre ones. Like, I can't tell you anything about half the Marvel movies I've seen, but I will never forget watching Rebel Wilson eat cockroaches while doing cat comedy, that image is burned into my retinas forever.
354. Pretty much. I have a whole spreadsheet ranking them by different categories of terrible. There's "technically incompetent," there's "wildly misguided passion project," there's "studio interference disaster," and my personal favorite category which is "how did this get 200 million dollars and why does the Rock fight a giant wolf in Chicago."
355. Yes! See, you remember it too. That movie asked the question "what if we made King Kong but there were three of them and also The Rock could speak gorilla sign language" and somehow Warner Brothers said yes, here's all the money, please make this immediately.
356. [shaky voice] Wait, you're telling me you watched a movie where The Rock has heartfelt conversations with an albino gorilla named George and you thought "yes, this is quality cinema, this deserves my emotional investment," because I need to understand how your brain works right now.
357. George! The gorilla's acting was the compelling part! Not the part where they evacuated the entire city of Chicago so three giant monsters could have a wrestling match on top of Willis Tower, no, it was George's emotional journey that really sold it for you.
358. That's completely different. I saw Cats twice as an anthropological study of human failure. You're out here getting genuinely invested in the friendship between Dwayne Johnson and a CGI primate who makes inappropriate hand gestures. That's basically just watching a buddy cop movie where one of the cops is extinct.
359. First of all, everyone cried when the brachiosaurus got left on the island, that was deliberately manipulative filmmaking and they knew exactly what they were doing with that John Williams music. Second of all, we're not talking about me, we're talking about your concerning emotional attachment to George the gorilla.
360. Obviously yes. I just found out there's a movie from 2013 called Sharknado where a tornado full of sharks attacks Los Angeles and the only solution is chainsaws. It spawned five sequels, which means someone watched a movie about shark tornadoes and said "you know what this needs? A continuing storyline."
361. Oh wow, I mean, I can see why it might look that way from the outside, but there's actually this whole language of movement happening that's, um, deeply intentional and incredibly difficult to execute.
362. [long pause] You know, I used to think the exact same thing, honestly, until I saw this piece about, err, refugee experiences where the dancers literally made me feel displacement in my bones without saying a single word.
363. Mmm, I hear you, but have you ever tried to control every single muscle while expressing raw emotion? These dancers train for decades, their bodies are like, I mean, they're instruments capable of telling stories that words just can't reach.
364. Because it saved me, honestly. When my mom was dying, I couldn't, um, I couldn't talk about it, but watching dancers express grief through movement helped me process things I didn't even know I was holding.
365. [crying while speaking] How can you say that when it literally helps people heal? I've seen veterans with PTSD find release through contemporary dance, kids who couldn't speak finally expressing themselves, it's so much more than just movement.
366. [apologetic] Hey, I totally respect ballet, it's gorgeous and disciplined, but contemporary dance has its own structure, it's just, well, it's about breaking traditional forms to find new ways of communicating human experience, you know?
367. Gosh, maybe sometimes it is, but isn't all art a little self-indulgent? The vulnerability it takes to share your deepest emotions through your body, that's actually incredibly generous, not selfish.
368. Oh right, yes! And that walking probably took months to perfect because it's not just walking, it's, um, embodying an entire narrative through pace and weight and breath and intention that most people don't even realize they're absorbing.
369. Mmm, am I though? Or are you maybe, just maybe, afraid of what you might feel if you actually let yourself experience it without judgment? Because that's totally valid, it can be really overwhelming.
370. [delighted] Really? Oh my god, okay, there's this piece by Crystal Pite about, err, conflict resolution where the dancers literally become the argument itself, and I swear it will completely shift how you see human communication!
371. It's a rental, actually. Lost a bet with my investment team last quarter, and here we are. They said formal attire or forfeit my parking spot for a year.
372. Already put down the damage deposit. Figured if I'm going to look ridiculous, might as well commit fully to the aesthetic.
373. Platinum family heirlooms, yeah. My grandmother would probably haunt me if she knew, but she also taught me never to back down from a challenge.
374. The way I see it, everyone else is trying to look athletic and prepared. I'm providing entertainment value and raising money for the children's hospital, so why not make it memorable?
375. Alexander, but everyone calls me Lex. Flying solo today because my teammates chickened out when they saw the weather forecast.
376. That's the one. Apparently crawling through electrified mud pits during a potential thunderstorm wasn't covered in their liability waivers. Can't say I blame them, but the show must go on.
377. Probably both. My therapist says I have issues with risk assessment, but she also runs ultramarathons, so I take that with a grain of salt.
378. [clearing throat] I've actually been practicing in my backyard. The jacket tears away—it's held together with velcro. The pants, unfortunately, are staying intact for modesty's sake.
379. [condescending] You should hear my strategy for the tire run. It involves a physics equation and what I call the pendulum principle of mud displacement.
380. [singing] Absolutely making it up, every single word, but confidence is half the battle in these things, wouldn't you agree?
381. [empathetically] Look, I get that corporate thinks this is going to boost numbers. But cutting our commission from fifteen percent to eight percent while expecting us to maintain the same referral volume? That's just not realistic.
382. [overly polite] Oh absolutely, they're being so generous with their new "tiered structure" that requires fifty referrals just to reach the old base rate. Meanwhile the CEO just bought his third yacht, but sure, let's tighten the belts on the people actually bringing in customers.
383. [cry loudly] It's worse than impossible, it's insulting! They know the average rep brings in maybe twelve referrals a quarter, so this is basically a pay cut disguised as an "opportunity for growth."
384. Right, because the problem is definitely our work ethic and not the fact that they've systematically destroyed every incentive we had. Last year they cut the holiday bonuses, this year it's referrals, next year they'll probably charge us for using the office coffee machine.
385. Sarah's smart. She saw this coming when they started those "optimization meetings" three months ago. Half the sales team is already interviewing elsewhere, and honestly, I don't blame them one bit.
386. [shaky voice] I've got three kids and a mortgage, so walking away isn't exactly simple. But I'm done pretending this is acceptable. We built this referral network from nothing, and now they want to squeeze us for every penny.
387. The worst part is they'll act shocked when referral numbers tank next month. "Why aren't people motivated?" they'll ask, while sitting in their glass offices counting the money they saved by screwing us over.
388. Maybe. Jennifer from accounting says we've got enough signatures now, but you know how corporate plays dirty. They'll probably start offering selective raises to break solidarity, same playbook as always.
389. And it'll work again because people have bills to pay. That's the genius of their system - keep us desperate enough that we can't afford to fight back properly, but not quite desperate enough to riot.
390. The really messed up part? They sent that email at 4:47 on a Friday. They knew exactly what they were doing, dropping that bomb and running for the weekend while we all spiral.
391. [frustrated] Are you kidding me? I just—I literally just got the email. [bitter] Three hundred hours. That's what I spent studying for this thing. The archery technician certification, the one that was supposed to, um... supposed to actually mean something. [sigh] And now they're telling me it's not recognized anymore? [angry] Like, what does that even mean? I passed the exam, I paid the fees, I did the practicum with actual compound bows and, err... recurves and all that technical stuff. [confused] How can they just decide it doesn't count? [pause] I mean, I turned down that job at the sporting goods store because I thought—well, I thought this certification would lead to something better. [regretful] God, I'm such an idiot. [very sad] My dad said I should've gone into HVAC instead but no, I had to follow my passion, right? [sarcastic] "Do what you love," everyone said. [upset] Yeah well, apparently what I love doesn't exist in this state anymore. [exhausted] So now I've got to what, start over? Take some new certification that'll probably be worthless in, hmm, two years? [long pause] I don't even know if I have it in me to do this again. [very quietly] I really thought this was it, you know?
392. [nervous] Okay, so I just... I actually did it. The bindery machine, the one that's been sitting there like some kind of, um, mechanical nightmare for literally months? [laugh] I finally figured it out. God, I was so scared of that thing. Every time I walked past it, I'd just... I'd pretend I didn't see it, you know? [embarrassed] Like if I ignored it hard enough, maybe someone else would deal with it.

But today I thought, hmm, what if I just tried? Really tried. And the manual—oh my god, the manual actually made sense this time. [excited] The tension settings, the paper guides, that weird lever thing that I thought was broken but turns out you have to pull it twice? All of it just clicked! [gasp softly] I made twenty perfect bound reports. Twenty! 

[very quietly] I kept waiting for it to jam or, I don't know, catch fire or something. But it didn't. It just... worked. [relieved] And Sarah walked by and she was like "Oh, you got it working?" Like it was no big deal. But it IS a big deal! [proud] I conquered that stupid machine. [chuckle] Tomorrow I'm binding everything. Everything.
393. [bitter] They needed me broken. That's the thing I'm finally seeing. [pause] When I was using, they'd, um... they'd swoop in, you know? Mom with her worried calls, Dad sending money for "groceries" that we both knew wasn't for groceries. [sad] My sister organizing those interventions that never worked but made everyone feel like they were helping. [sigh] And now I'm clean—six months clean—and they don't know what to do with me. [confused] It's like I broke the rules or something? [short pause] I went to dinner last week and Mom kept asking if I was "really okay" like she was, I don't know, disappointed? [frustrated] She literally said "you seem different." [laugh] Yeah Mom, I'm not high anymore! [regretful] But the thing is... without the crisis, without me being the mess they could rally around, we have nothing to talk about. [very sad] Twenty years of our entire relationship being about my addiction and now it's just... silence. [pause] Dad hasn't called in three weeks. [whispering] I think they miss the version of me that needed saving. [bitter] Because at least that version gave them a purpose, right? [sniffle] And now I'm just... I'm nobody to them.
394. [hesitantly] I've been meaning to tell you something for a while now. [pause] You probably don't even realize this, but um... the way you were with me during the whole divorce thing? [very sincerely] It literally saved me. [sigh] I know that sounds dramatic but it's true. [emotional] When everyone else was, er, pushing me to "just get over it" or telling me I needed to be stronger, you just... you let me be a mess. [chuckle] Remember when I couldn't stop crying in the break room that one Tuesday? [warmly] You just sat there and handed me tissues. [pause] Didn't try to fix anything or give advice. [getting emotional] And when I'd, hmm, when I'd ramble about the same stuff over and over—God, I must have told you about the custody battle like fifty times—you never once made me feel like I was being too much. [sniffle] That patience you showed, it was... I don't know, it kept me going somehow. [very quietly] There were days I didn't think I'd make it through. [pause] But knowing I could come to work and you'd just, um, you'd understand? [grateful] That made all the difference. [warm] So yeah, I just... thank you. [very sincerely] Really, thank you.
395. [exhausted] Three lines. That's all it was—three lines in tomorrow's scene and I couldn't sleep last night. My agent called it my "breakthrough moment" and I just... I don't know, I kept thinking about all those years as background. You know what's funny? [pause] Nobody ever looked at me then. I could just... exist. Be part of the world without being, um, without being seen, if that makes sense. [nostalgic] God, remember that courthouse scene I did last year? Two hundred extras, and I just sat there reading an actual book between takes. [laugh] Nobody cared! It was perfect. But now they're doing close-ups and the director keeps saying "give me more with your eyes" and I'm like—honestly? I don't want to give you anything. [quietly] I think I liked being furniture. [pause] Is that weird? Everyone's so excited for me, especially my mom, she's already telling people I'm "an actress now" and I can't exactly say, er... actually, I miss being invisible. [sigh] Tomorrow they want me to cry on cue. Real tears. And all I keep thinking is how nice it was when I could just walk through frame holding a coffee cup and nobody expected me to feel anything. [trailing off] Maybe I'm just scared, I don't know...
396. [very quietly] They actually called me a legend. [chuckle] Me. I mean, I'm sitting here looking at this invitation and it says—it literally says "legendary contributions to the field." [pause] Gosh, when did that happen? When did I become the person that, um... that younger people look up to? [nostalgic] I remember being twenty-five, terrified, screwing up that first major project so badly I thought my career was over. And now they want me to mentor the next generation. [laugh] 

The thing is, I still feel like I'm figuring it out, you know? Like, honestly, half the time I'm just... I'm winging it. [anxiously] What if they realize I don't have all the answers? What if I'm actually, erhm, terrible at teaching? [pause] 

But then I think about Martinez, how she took me under her wing when I was nobody. [warm] She probably felt the same way. Maybe that's the point—we're all just, hmm, passing on what we learned from our mistakes. [smiling speaking] God, I can't wait to meet these kids. They're going to be brilliant. Way more brilliant than I ever was. [emotionally] And that's... yeah, that's exactly how it should be.
397. [bitter] Too strict. That's what she said to me. Too strict about grades and responsibility. [pause] Like expecting a B average and doing your homework is somehow abusive. [frustrated] And now she wants to live with her dad full-time because what, because he lets her stay up until 2 AM on school nights? [sarcastic] Because he doesn't check if she actually studied for her tests? Great parenting, really stellar. [hurt] I'm the bad guy for caring about her future. [pause] For wanting her to actually, I don't know, succeed in life? [angry] Meanwhile he gets to be the fun weekend dad who never has to enforce anything. [stuttering] I-I've been doing this alone for three years. [very sad] Three years of making sure she gets to school, checking her assignments, going to parent-teacher conferences by myself while he shows up twice a year and suddenly he's parent of the year. [crying while speaking] She looked at me like I was some kind of monster. [pause] Maybe I am, um... maybe I am too hard on her. [regretful] But I just wanted her to have options, you know? [quietly] To not struggle like I did. [bitter] And now she's choosing him. [long pause] [exhausted] Fine. Let him deal with the real parenting for once.
398. Three weeks. I've been tracking this thing for three weeks and I... [shaky voice] God, I can't believe I missed it. [pause] The signatures were right there, buried in the logs, I just—I thought it was a false positive. [regretful] Should've dug deeper, should've known better. [sigh]

Okay, so, um... the breach happened sometime last Tuesday. [anxious] They got everything—account numbers, routing info, probably social security numbers too. [very quietly] Thousands of customers. Maybe tens of thousands. [groan]

I keep running through it in my head, like, what if I'd caught it Monday? [frustrated] What if I hadn't dismissed that alert as noise? The malware was so... hmm, it was elegant, I'll give them that. [bitter] Polymorphic, constantly shifting its signature. [pause] But that's not an excuse, is it?

[upset] Management's going to want someone to blame. And honestly? They're right to blame me. [shaky voice] All those people who trusted us with their money, their futures, and I—[trailing off]

[angry] No, wait. You know what? We've been asking for better tools for months. [loudly] Begging for more staff! [sigh] But yeah, sure, one analyst covering three shifts worth of data, what could possibly go wrong? [sarcastic] Really great security strategy there.

[exhausted] I need to call the FBI. And the customers... God, the customers.
399. [warm] I just got off the call with Marcus from the factory. Three hundred and twelve jobs. Three hundred and twelve! In a town where the main employer shut down eighteen months ago. [pause] You know, everyone thought I was crazy backing a battery recycling startup that wanted to set up in the middle of nowhere Ohio. The other VCs literally laughed—"Why not Austin? Why not Boston?" [proud] But I knew. I could feel it in my gut when that twenty-three-year-old kid pitched me with dirt under his fingernails because he'd been working in his dad's garage. [slowly] His dad who lost his job when the steel plant closed. [emotional] Marcus just told me they had two thousand applications. Two thousand people hoping for a chance. And they're not just hiring engineers, they're training people—welders, technicians, logistics. Real jobs with benefits. [voice breaking] There's this one guy, fifty-seven years old, he'd been unemployed for a year, and he just... he broke down crying at orientation. [pause] Look, I've made plenty of money on exits before. But this is, um... this is different. This isn't about multiples or valuations. [very quietly] We actually changed something. We brought a town back to life. [sniffle]
400. I saw him at Mrs. Chen's door yesterday and I just... knew. [pause] Something about the way he held that clipboard, the way he leaned in when she started talking. [quietly] God, I used to do that exact same thing. The whole "concerned neighbor from the gas company" routine—I mean, I ran that one for, what, three years? [regretful] So when he started in with the whole "we detected a leak" thing, I just walked right over. [confidently] "Hey buddy, which division you with?" [chuckle] Should've seen his face. He starts fumbling around, says he's new, and I'm like, hmm, weird how you don't have a vehicle or any actual equipment. [sarcastic] Just that clipboard and a very official-looking vest from Amazon. [angry] These people, Mrs. Chen and Mr. Rodriguez, they're not marks, okay? [shaky voice] They're my neighbors. They bring me soup when I'm sick. [pause] So yeah, I called him out, told him I knew exactly what he was doing because—well, because I invented half these plays. [bitter] Takes one to know one, right? [relieved] But at least now I can use all that... knowledge for something good. [warm] Mrs. Chen made me cookies afterwards. [very quietly] Said I was her guardian angel or something. [sigh] If only she knew.
401. You know what gets me about this program? It's watching someone like Maria completely transform. [warm] Three years ago she was running... well, she was in a difficult situation, managing other women in that life. [pause] And now? She just opened her third location for her catering business. Third! [very excited] I mean, she's employing twelve people now—some of them women she used to know from before. [short pause] That's what this is really about.

[relieved] We had so many people saying it wouldn't work, that these women couldn't change, couldn't run legitimate businesses. But they already knew how to manage people, handle finances, deal with, um... difficult clients. [chuckle] Those are business skills, right? We just helped them redirect everything.

[passionately] The hardest part isn't teaching them business—they know business. It's helping them believe they deserve this second chance. [sad] Some of them carry so much shame. But then you see someone like Maria mentoring the newer participants, and it's like... [trailing off]

[happy] Last week she told me her daughter's proud of her now. Can you imagine? Her teenage daughter actually tells her friends what her mom does for work. [sniffle] That's everything. That's why we do this. These women aren't just surviving anymore—they're actually thriving.
402. [confused] Wait, these numbers can't be right. Let me just... okay so if we subtract the baseline from... [gasp softly] Oh my God. That's—that's three point seven million. [very quietly] Three point seven million dollars. [pause] I need to check this again because there's no way my little routing algorithm actually... [speeding up] but it did, it absolutely did, look at the quarterly comparisons! [laugh] I mean, they all thought I was crazy when I suggested we reverse the hub priority system. [bitter] "That's not how logistics works, Sarah." [mocking] "You can't just flip conventional wisdom on its head." [pause] Well, guess what? Apparently you can. [very excited] This is insane! We're talking about, um... what, like forty percent reduction in shipping costs? [triumphant] And the best part is, err, it's actually scalable across all regions. [whispering] I can't believe this is real. [emotional] All those nights staring at spreadsheets, trying to find patterns nobody else could see... [sniffle] God, I need to tell someone about this. [very sincerely] Actually no, first I need to triple-check these numbers because if I'm wrong... [trailing off] But I'm not wrong. [confidently] I'm really not wrong this time.
403. [confused] Six months. Six months I spent on those mattes. [frustrated] Every single skyline, every building extension, every goddamn cloud formation that made their stupid alien invasion look believable. [pause] And they just... cut it all? [bitter] The director told me this morning like it was nothing. [mocking] "We're going in a different direction with the third act." [angry] A different direction! [laugh] They reshot the entire ending apparently. [very sad] My parents already told everyone about this film. [shaky voice] They've been so proud, telling their friends their kid finally made it to a real studio production. [sigh] I turned down two other jobs for this. [very quietly] Two actual paying jobs because this was supposed to be the one. [trailing off] The one that gets me noticed, that gets me... [upset] And now it's just gone. [pause] I keep refreshing the film's page, thinking maybe they'll change their minds. [bitter] But they won't. [exhausted] They already released the new trailer yesterday. [regretful] None of my work is in it. [angry] Not a single frame! [very sad] I don't even know if I can put this on my reel now. [frustrated] What am I supposed to say? [quietly] "Here's six months of work that, um, that nobody will ever see"? [sigh] God, I'm so tired.
404. [anxious] I know what you're thinking, okay? I know. But I just—I need to check one more time. Just one more. [sigh] Look, you weren't there last night when she made that weird little sound, that sort of... I don't know, that wheeze? And yes, I know babies make sounds, everyone keeps telling me that, but what if this time it's different? [quickly] What if this is the one time I don't check and something's actually wrong? 

[frustrated] You keep saying I need help like I'm—like I'm crazy or something. I'm not crazy, I'm just... [pause] Okay, maybe setting my alarm for every ten minutes is a bit much. Maybe. But honestly? I'd rather be exhausted than miss something. [shaky voice] Because what kind of mother would I be if I just, you know, slept through something happening to her? 

[exhausted] And I get it, I really do. You need sleep, I need sleep, we're both walking around like zombies. [trailing off] But when I lie there in the dark, all I can think about is... [very quietly] what if she stops breathing and I'm just lying there doing nothing? 

[upset] So yeah, maybe I do need help. [sniffle] Maybe this isn't normal. But right now, checking on her is the only thing that makes me feel like I'm doing something right.
405. [surprised] Okay, that was... weird. [pause] This woman just came up to me after the meeting—I don't even know her name—and she said my approach was, um, "refreshing." [confused] Like, what does that even mean? [short pause] I was just trying to get people to actually listen to each other instead of, you know, screaming over each other. [hesitantly] And I guess... I mean, maybe it worked? [relieved] God, that meeting was such a mess at first. [anxious] Everyone was so angry about the parking restrictions and I thought—I honestly thought someone was gonna throw a chair. [laugh] But then when I suggested we, uh, break into smaller groups and actually write down concerns instead of just yelling them... [trailing off] I don't know, people actually did it. [warm] And this stranger noticed. [shy] She said I had this, what did she call it, "collaborative spirit" that the community needed. [chuckle] Me. [pause] The person who usually just sits in the back and, um, avoids all conflict. [sincerely] Maybe I actually helped today? [happy] That feels... hmm, that feels really good actually.
406. [exhausted] Another denial letter printed. Mrs. Chen's chemo. That's the third one today for cancer treatment. [pause] I keep her file open on my screen longer than I should, staring at her photo, at the kids' names in her emergency contacts. Two daughters. [sigh] Same ages as mine, actually. [very quietly] But the protocol says experimental treatment isn't covered, so that's—that's what I type. Protocol denied. Claim rejected. [bitter] I've gotten really good at the wording. Professional. Apologetic but firm. Never personal. [pause] They pay me seventy-eight thousand a year. With benefits. Dental for the kids, ironically enough. College savings. The mortgage on our place. [shaky voice] Yesterday this man called, sobbing about his wife's medication, and I had to tell him... [trailing off] [long pause] I had to tell him no. While my own family's prescriptions sit filled in my bag. [very sad] My daughter asked me last week what I do at work. I said I help people with their insurance. [laugh] Help. That's, um... that's one way to put it. [regretful] Sometimes I wonder if the people I deny think about me. If they picture someone like me. A person with their own bills, their own kids. Or if I'm just a letterhead. A stamp. [very quietly] God, I hope I'm just a stamp.
407. [confused] Wait, what do you mean she's been telling them everything? Like, everything everything? For how long—years? [pause] Oh my god. That's why Mom always knew when I was struggling at work. That's why Dad randomly called that time I had the fight with Marcus. I thought they were just, I don't know, weirdly intuitive or something. [bitter] But no, it was just Emma. Sweet little Emma who I trusted with everything. [sigh] God, I'm such an idiot. All those times I defended her to our parents, told them to ease up on her, and she was just... what, collecting information? [angry] Like some kind of family spy? That's so messed up. And the worst part is she'd sit there while I vented about Mom and Dad, nodding along like she understood, like we were on the same team. [hurt] We were never on the same team, were we? [pause] I don't even know what to do with this. Do I confront her? Do I tell our parents I know? Everything feels, um... everything feels fake now. Every conversation, every laugh, every time she asked how I was doing—was any of it real? Or was she just, uh, gathering intel for her next report? [very sad] I thought we were close. I really thought we were close.
408. They're actually doing it. Right there in the parking lot with the shredder truck, just... destroying everything. [bitter] Three years of fighting them and I won, but this is what victory looks like? [pause] I mean, I got my settlement, the judge ruled in my favor, but watching this... God. Those boxes, they're full of—I recognize Sarah's handwriting on that one. [upset] She's still fighting her case. [sigh] Was fighting, I guess. Because now all her evidence is just... gone.

[angry] They waited exactly one day after my case closed to do this. One day. Like they knew, um, they knew I couldn't use any of this against them anymore. [shaky voice] But all those other people who got hurt the way I did, they're never gonna... [pause] Hmm. Maybe I should be recording this. [quickly] Actually no, wait, I am recording this. My phone's been on this whole time.

[relieved] Oh thank God. [laugh] They're so stupid. They're literally destroying evidence in broad daylight and I'm getting all of it. [excited] This is—I mean, this might not help my case anymore but Sarah and Marcus and everyone else who's still... [hopeful] Yeah. Yeah, this changes everything. [very quietly] They're not getting away with this.
409. [shaky voice] I keep looking at the numbers and they're... they're not changing. [pause] Eighty-seven percent loss. [very quietly] Eighty-seven percent of their retirement funds, just gone. [sigh] I mean, the model was solid, the fundamentals were—God, listen to me. [bitter] Still talking like an analyst when these people are calling, crying about how they can't, um... can't afford their medication now. [upset] One woman said she's seventy-eight and might have to go back to work. [loudly] Seventy-eight! [regretful] And I'm the one who wrote "strong buy" on that recommendation. [pause] My boss keeps saying it was, you know, market conditions, unprecedented volatility, but that's—that's bullshit and we both know it. [angry] We pushed too hard for the quarterly numbers. [crying while speaking] I knew the leverage ratios were concerning but I just... I thought we had more time to unwind the position. [sniffle] These aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet anymore. [very slowly] They're real people who trusted us with everything they had. [whispering] And I destroyed their lives with a PowerPoint presentation and some Excel formulas. [long pause] How do you even, er... how do you apologize for that? [very sad] You can't.
410. [very quietly] Eight months. [pause] Eight months of... of shaving down braces until my fingers went numb. [warm] And when she played that first chord—God, I actually felt it in my chest, you know? [laughs] Like my ribs were resonating with the soundboard. [very sincerely] I mean, I've made guitars before, but this one was, um... it was different somehow. [hesitantly] The rosette alone took me three weeks—I kept thinking it wasn't quite right, kept starting over. [chuckle] My wife said I was being obsessive. [quickly] But then when I saw those tears rolling down her face while she played that melody... [pause] Jesus. [emotional] That's why we do this, isn't it? [trailing off] Not for the money, God knows there's no money in this... [laughs] But for that moment when the wood you've been, er, coaxing and shaping for months finally sings. [very excited] And it sang today! [relieved] All those nights wondering if I'd chosen the right spruce, if the tap tone was actually perfect or if I was just, hmm, convincing myself it was. [happy] Worth it. [sigh] Every blister, every time I had to scrap a binding because it chipped. [passionately] When an instrument can make someone cry like that—that's not craftsmanship anymore. [whispering] That's something else entirely.
411. [stern] Cut the act, I saw you in the rigging loft thirty minutes before the screening. [firmly] You were messing with the DMX cables and the main power distribution, and we both know that's what caused the blackout.
412. [angry] I've been running lights for twenty years, and I know sabotage when I see it. [loudly] You reversed the phase sequence on purpose, knowing it would trip the breakers right at the climax of the film. [pause]
413. [confidently] Accident my ass, you knew exactly which circuits controlled the main theater. [firmly] I watched you study the electrical diagrams I left on my workbench last week when you were supposedly here for a 'friendly visit.'
414. [very quietly] Here's the thing you didn't count on—I installed security cameras in the rigging loft last month after equipment started going missing. [triumphantly] Got you on video, clear as day, with timestamps and everything.
415. [boldly] Your twin was on stage doing sound check at that exact time, surrounded by fifty crew members. [sternly] Plus, you're wearing that distinctive scar on your hand from when you tried this shit at their gallery opening last year.
416. [calmly] That's your problem to work out in therapy, not by destroying their career. [firmly] I'm giving you two options: leave town tonight and never come near any production your twin is involved in, or I hand this footage to the police. [sighs]
417. [empathetically] Maybe there's history between you two that I don't understand, but sabotaging someone's work isn't justice. [firmly] It's just petty revenge that makes you look like the villain you're trying so hard not to be.
418. [frustrated] I light actors, it's my job, not some conspiracy to boost anyone's ego. [loudly] Your twin earned this premiere through years of hard work while you've been plotting in the shadows like some cartoon antagonist.
419. [exhausted] Just go.
420. [relieved] Whatever helps you sleep at night, just stay away from my sets. [firmly] I've already sent copies of that footage to three different people with instructions to release it if anything happens to me or your twin's next project. [pause]
421. [calmly] The one you call beast sent me to speak in her stead, believing that perhaps words might succeed where centuries of bloodshed have failed. [pause] She's willing to negotiate terms that could end this conflict permanently.
422. She deeply regrets Westmarch, though I know those words mean nothing to you now. The hunters from that village had been stealing eggs from her nest for decades, selling them to alchemists for gold.
423. [firmly] Those weren't just eggs, they were her last viable offspring after eight hundred years of life. [quietly] Imagine if someone kept stealing human infants from their cribs, grinding them into powder for potions.
424. [passionately] And every dead human settlement means another generation of dragons raised on stories of your cruelty, trained from birth to fear and hate your kind! [sighs] This cycle has to end somewhere, doesn't it?
425. [very quietly] Seven years. She saved me from the ruins of Westmarch when I was eleven, pulled me from the flames her own rage had created. [pause] I've lived with that irony every single day since.
426. [empathetically] I've seen both sides of this war now, lived in both worlds, and I'm telling you that neither species is the monster the other believes. She mourns every death, even as she causes them in her grief and fury.
427. [anxious] No, but your vengeance won't either, will it? You could kill her today and another dragon will rise to avenge her, just as you rose to avenge Westmarch. [speeding up] How many more generations will we feed to this hatred?
428. [confidently] Complete withdrawal to the Northern Wastes, no human settlements attacked for one hundred years, and she'll enforce this treaty among her kind. In exchange, humans cease all dragon hunting and egg harvesting immediately and permanently.
429. [warmly] Me. I'll live those hundred years as her proxy, aging as slowly as she does now that I carry her mark. [very quietly] I'll be the living memory of this treaty, the bridge between our kinds.
430. [sincerely] Perhaps it's both, but someone has to be the first to lower their sword, don't they? [softly] Will you at least meet her, see for yourself that she's more than the monster you've imagined?
431. [very quietly] Danny. [clearing throat] Wow, I should've known when they mentioned bringing in the best guitar tech in the city. [nervously] You're still working with instruments then, that's... that's good.
432. [quickly] It pays the bills, provides health insurance, lets me sleep in the same bed every night instead of, um, crashing on venue floors. [defensively] Some of us had to grow up eventually, Danny.
433. [regretful] Yeah, I suppose we did.
434. [shaky voice] Every single day, actually, especially when I'm booking these wedding bands who play the same covers we used to mock. [laughs bitterly] Sometimes I hear a guitar being tuned and I literally have to leave the room.
435. [very melancholic] That Strat was the first real guitar I ever owned, saved up for two summers to buy it. [sighs] But keeping it would've been torture, just sitting there reminding me of everything I gave up.
436. [frustrated] Come on, Danny, arranging shrimp towers and wine pairings isn't exactly the same as writing songs that could change someone's life. [pause] We both know that's just something I tell myself to sleep at night.
437. [surprised] You stopped playing? [confused] But you were the best guitarist I ever knew, Danny, you had that thing, that spark that made people stop whatever they were doing just to listen.
438. [apologetic] No, it was completely fair, and I deserved that. [very quietly] I panicked, Danny, I saw that A&R guy's card and suddenly all I could think about was becoming another cautionary tale about failed musicians. [exhales] So I ran.
439. [warmly] There's a piano in the venue's east wing that nobody ever uses, it's perfectly tuned. [hesitantly] I mean, if you have time after fixing the Gibson, maybe we could, um, I don't know, just play something?
440. [relieved] I remember everything, Danny, every chord change, every harmony we worked out in your garage. [very sincerely] Maybe that's the real torture, having perfect recall of the life you walked away from. [pause] But yeah, let's play.
441. [warmly] Neither actually, I've been in Denver for the past three years. [pause] You look exactly the same though, down to that nervous thing you do with your hands when you're uncomfortable.
442. [gently] Therapy? Good for you.
443. [hesitantly] Listen, I know we haven't talked since that whole mess five years ago, but seeing you here tonight [exhales] brings back a lot of things I thought I'd processed already.
444. [frustrated] You always did that, just agreed with whatever I said without actually engaging. [pause] Some things really don't change, even after all this time apart.
445. Am I a trigger now? [quietly] That's not exactly what anyone wants to be called by someone they once thought they'd marry.
446. [bitter] Great, so I broke you?
447. [softly] It felt like love to me, at least at the beginning. [sighs] Before it became suffocating, before I realized I was losing myself trying to be your everything.
448. [warmly] I know you are, and honestly, I forgave you years ago. [chuckles] Denver has been good for that, lots of mountains to climb and think about what really matters.
449. [laughing] You still check my Instagram? [pause] Yeah, I'm happy, found someone who lets me be myself without needing me to complete them, if that makes sense.
450. [sincerely] Maybe we did.
451. [firmly] Mr. Kowalski, this is a formal Article 32 hearing, not a casual interview. [pause] Your testimony could determine whether Sergeant Williams faces twenty years in military prison for sabotage and desertion.
452. [stern] The surveillance footage shows you stopped your equipment at 2317 hours and walked toward Building 42. [slowly] That's the same building where the explosive devices were later discovered.
453. [calmly] Please describe exactly what you observed about this individual's appearance and behavior. [formally] Remember, you're under oath and perjury carries serious consequences even for civilian contractors.
454. Did you recognize this person as Sergeant Williams, whom you'd seen multiple times during your three months working on base? [waiting] The prosecution claims you positively identified him to investigators.
455. [empathetically] Mr. Kowalski, I understand your reluctance, but we need clarity here. [firmly] Did you or did you not tell Staff Sergeant Chen that you were "ninety percent sure" it was Williams?
456. [quickly] That's a yes then. [formally] Now, you mentioned in your second statement that you heard Williams arguing with Lieutenant Morrison earlier that day about deployment orders, is that correct?
457. [sympathetically] His daughter has leukemia, that's in his personnel file. [pause] But personal hardship doesn't justify sabotaging military vehicles that other soldiers depend on for their safety.
458. [firmly] That's for the panel to consider during sentencing if he's convicted. [formally] Right now, I need to know if you saw anyone else in that area between 2300 and 2400 hours.
459. [curious] Did you happen to note the vehicle number or recognize the driver? [quickly] Every detail matters when we're trying to establish a timeline of events.
460. [reassuringly] Your testimony has been consistent across all interviews, Mr. Kowalski, that speaks to your credibility. [formally] This court appreciates your cooperation despite the inconvenience to your work schedule.
461. [quietly] Yeah, that was me. [sighs] Found him tangled in my lines about four miles out, near the shelf where the water gets deep.
462. [firmly] Your father wasn't drunk, and his boat was in perfect condition. [pause] Whatever you think you know about how he lived these last years, you're wrong.
463. Maybe you knew who he was twenty years ago, but people change. [sighs] He talked about you sometimes, especially after the diagnosis.
464. [gently] Pancreatic cancer, stage four, found out three months ago. [quietly] He said he'd rather go out on his own terms than waste away in some hospital bed.
465. [warm] He left something for you on my boat, said if you ever came back, I should give it to you. [pause] It's a lockbox with some papers and recordings he made.
466. [carefully] He started making them after the diagnosis, sitting out on the dock most evenings with an old cassette recorder. [sighs] Said there were things he needed to explain about why your mother left, why he let you go.
467. The accident wasn't what you think it was. [very quietly] She was leaving that night, had her bags packed, and he knew but didn't try to stop her.
468. [empathetically] He tried to follow her but his truck wouldn't start, battery was dead from the cold. [pause] By the time he got to a phone, the state police were already at the door.
469. [gently] He stopped drinking eight years ago, joined AA, started helping other fishermen get sober too. [sighs] Even sponsored a couple guys who'd lost their licenses.
470. [softly] The lockbox is on my boat at slip seven whenever you're ready. [pause] Take your time, the recordings aren't going anywhere, and neither am I.
471. [very quietly] Twenty-three years, and this is how we meet again. [clearing throat] Your assistant scheduled this meeting without mentioning your last name, just said you were the lead AE on the account.
472. Of course I recognize you, Daniel. [shaky voice] You have your father's eyes but that determined set to your jaw, that's all me. Though I suppose you wouldn't want to hear that comparison.
473. [apologetic] Right, yes, the business at hand. [sighs] I've reviewed their current allocations and honestly, whoever set up their original plan did them no favors with those fee structures.
474. [wincing] Daniel, I know what you're implying, and you have every right to be angry about—well, about everything. [pause] But this account, these people's retirements, they deserve better than our baggage affecting their futures.
475. Look, I can recommend moving their assets to a series of index-based target-date funds that would cut their fees by sixty percent. [quickly] It's the right move regardless of who's suggesting it or what you think of me personally.
476. [surprised] Together? [nervously] You want to do a joint presentation after this, after finding out who I am and what I did to you and your father?
477. You're right, of course, the client comes first. [sadly] I just want you to know that I've followed your career, Daniel. Every promotion, every success, I've watched from a distance, proud but knowing I gave up any right to tell you that.
478. [crying while speaking] I wrote you letters, dozens of them, but I never sent them because what could I possibly say? [pause] 'Sorry I chose my career over my family' doesn't exactly fit on a Hallmark card.
479. [warmly] I'll have everything in your inbox by close of business today, with my personal cell too. [hesitantly] Daniel, after this deal closes, would you maybe consider having coffee? No expectations, just—
480. [very quietly] Understood. [pause] I'll make sure this is the smoothest retirement plan transition Hartfield has ever seen. It's the least I can do.
481. [quietly] You remember my dad's truck? [surprised] I thought you'd have fixed thousands of rigs since then, figured we'd just be another invoice in a filing cabinet somewhere.
482. [emotional] He talked about you until the day he died, said you were the only mechanic who ever treated his truck like it mattered. [voice breaking] Called you an artist with a welding torch.
483. [shocked] You're closing down? [louder] This place has been here since before I was born, my grandfather used to bring his milk truck here in the seventies!
484. [passionately] But you're the last real craftsman left on this highway! [frustrated] Everyone else just slaps parts on, nobody actually repairs anything anymore, nobody cares about the history in these machines.
485. [eagerly] I've got nothing but time, and this truck is all I have left of him. [pause] How long would it take to do it right, the way you would've done it for him?
486. [determined] Then I'm staying right here on that same bench where he sat. [firmly] Someone should witness the end of an era, and I want to learn what real craftsmanship looks like before it's gone forever.
487. There's a twenty-four hour diner two blocks down, I'll get us coffee and whatever they've got that passes for food. [warmly] Maybe you can teach me those card games while we work.
488. [respectfully] He always said you'd know when it was time to hang up the tools, said you'd feel it in your bones. [quietly] Guess he was right about that too.
489. [curious] What are you going to do after this? [concerned] Sixty-eight isn't that old, my dad drove until seventy-five, said the road kept him young even when his body disagreed.
490. [smiling speaking] Once a mechanic, always a mechanic, that's what dad used to say. [gratefully] Thank you for this, for making your last job mean something, for remembering him and his truck after all these years.
491. So they send a common laborer to wire my prison. [bitter] Twenty years ago, I had thousands of men like you building entire communication networks across this nation, and now you come here to give me a single telephone line.
492. [melancholic] Do you know what I used these lines for before? [sighs] I spoke to presidents, to generals who commanded armies, to business titans who moved billions with a single word from me.
493. [defensive] You know nothing! The Western media feeds you lies about mass graves and torture chambers, but they never mention the hospitals I built, the literacy programs, the fact that we had the lowest infant mortality rate in the region under my leadership.
494. [dismissive] Sacrifices had to be made for progress. [pause] Your brother-in-law chose the wrong side of history, and history is written by those with the strength to shape it, not by telephone repairmen.
495. [very quietly] They can try me, execute me if they wish, but my legacy will outlive their tribunals. [sighs] Monuments fall, but ideas persist, and there are still millions who remember when this country stood for something more than being another Western puppet state.
496. [melancholic] Down the hall, third door on the left, though I doubt you'll find what you're looking for. [quietly] The rats have been at the wiring for years now, just like they've been at everything else in this crumbling palace.
497. [bitter] Fear and violence? [laughs] Your democratic heroes drop bombs from drones on wedding parties and call it spreading freedom, but when I maintained order in my own borders, suddenly I'm the monster.
498. Tell me, lineman, when you're splicing those wires together, do you ever think about how many last words have traveled through copper lines like these? [melancholic] How many final goodbyes, how many pleas for mercy that went unheard?
499. [resigned] The junction box is actually behind a portrait of my father in the hallway. [very quietly] He was a tyrant too, they say, though he only killed his enemies, not his friends like I learned to do.
500. [melancholic] Three calls to a world that's already forgotten me except as a cautionary tale. [exhales] Fix your wires, lineman, and leave me to practice my defense for judges who've already decided my fate.
501. [calmly] Your sales are impressive, absolutely, but we've received seventeen formal complaints in the past month alone. [pause] People are saying you told one customer their sandwich choice was 'a cry for help' and another that their meat selection 'screamed unresolved childhood trauma.'
502. [patiently] That may be true for him, but Mrs. Henderson left in tears when you apparently suggested her turkey order meant she was 'settling for mediocrity in all aspects of life.' [clearing throat] She's been a customer for twelve years.
503. [firmly] Your job is to serve deli meat, not provide unsolicited life coaching. [sighs] I understand you mean well, but we can't have employees psychoanalyzing customers based on their lunch preferences.
504. [curious] Why do you think it's your responsibility to shake people out of their routines? [pause] What makes you believe a deli counter is the appropriate venue for these interventions?
505. [gently] I hear what you're saying, and honestly, your passion is admirable. [warmly] But corporate has specific customer service standards, and telling people their sandwich choices reflect their fear of commitment isn't among them.
506. [analytically] Those numbers are precisely why we're having this conversation instead of a termination meeting. [pause] But I need you to understand that your approach, while effective for sales, is creating liability issues we can't ignore.
507. [stern] For that, exactly that right there. [firmly] The marriage comment you made to Mr. Peterson has resulted in a potential discrimination lawsuit that legal is now handling.
508. [sympathetically] Listen, I'm going to propose something unconventional here. [thoughtfully] What if we create a special position for you—'Deli Sommelier' or something similar—where your commentary is expected, even advertised?
509. [warmly] Your methods are unorthodox, but you're right about the numbers. [chuckles] If we frame this correctly, make it opt-in, add some disclaimers, we might have something special here—the first therapeutic deli experience.
510. [laughing] Let's start with baby steps—maybe just a sign that says 'Warning: Counter service may include existential commentary.' [pause] But yes, I think we can make this work if you promise to dial it back just ten percent.
