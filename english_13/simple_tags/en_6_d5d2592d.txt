Scenario: A deli clerk with record-breaking sales meets with corporate HR after customer complaints about their unconventional practice of psychoanalyzing people based on their sandwich orders.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [defensive] Look, I know why I'm here, okay? [sighs] Some customers got their feelings hurt because I told them the truth about what they're eating, but my sales numbers speak for themselves—I move more product than anyone else in this chain.

Character 2: [calmly] Your sales are impressive, absolutely, but we've received seventeen formal complaints in the past month alone. [pause] People are saying you told one customer their sandwich choice was 'a cry for help' and another that their meat selection 'screamed unresolved childhood trauma.'

Character 1: [frustrated] The guy ordered bologna with extra mayo on white bread—that IS a cry for help! [chuckles] Besides, he laughed, bought two sandwiches, and came back three times this week asking specifically for me.

Character 2: [patiently] That may be true for him, but Mrs. Henderson left in tears when you apparently suggested her turkey order meant she was 'settling for mediocrity in all aspects of life.' [clearing throat] She's been a customer for twelve years.

Character 1: [quickly] Mrs. Henderson needed to hear that! [passionately] She comes in every Tuesday, orders the exact same bland sandwich, and stares out the window like she's watching her dreams die. [softly] I was trying to help.

Character 2: [firmly] Your job is to serve deli meat, not provide unsolicited life coaching. [sighs] I understand you mean well, but we can't have employees psychoanalyzing customers based on their lunch preferences.

Character 1: You know what? Every single 'complaint' you've gotten is from someone who keeps coming back. [animated] They ask for me by name, they bring their friends, they actually engage instead of just pointing at meat through glass like zombies.

Character 2: [curious] Why do you think it's your responsibility to shake people out of their routines? [pause] What makes you believe a deli counter is the appropriate venue for these interventions?

Character 1: [passionately] Because I see the same dead-eyed people ordering the same dead-end sandwiches day after day! [exhales] When someone orders pastrami with horseradish, they're alive, they're taking risks, they're actually tasting something.

Character 2: [gently] I hear what you're saying, and honestly, your passion is admirable. [warmly] But corporate has specific customer service standards, and telling people their sandwich choices reflect their fear of commitment isn't among them.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, corporate standards, right—smile, slice, serve, repeat. [bitter] Never mind that I've increased foot traffic by thirty percent or that we're selling premium cuts at twice the rate of last year.

Character 2: [analytically] Those numbers are precisely why we're having this conversation instead of a termination meeting. [pause] But I need you to understand that your approach, while effective for sales, is creating liability issues we can't ignore.

Character 1: [defensively] Liability? [incredulous] For what, making people think about their choices? For suggesting maybe they deserve better than processed cheese and their third loveless marriage?

Character 2: [stern] For that, exactly that right there. [firmly] The marriage comment you made to Mr. Peterson has resulted in a potential discrimination lawsuit that legal is now handling.

Character 1: [quieter] He was wearing his wedding ring on a chain around his neck. [sighs] Ordering sad ham.

Character 2: [sympathetically] Listen, I'm going to propose something unconventional here. [thoughtfully] What if we create a special position for you—'Deli Sommelier' or something similar—where your commentary is expected, even advertised?

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, you're not firing me? [hopefully] You want to actually lean into this instead of shutting it down?

Character 2: [warmly] Your methods are unorthodox, but you're right about the numbers. [chuckles] If we frame this correctly, make it opt-in, add some disclaimers, we might have something special here—the first therapeutic deli experience.

Character 1: [excited] Oh my god, yes! [very quickly] We could have consent forms, maybe sandwich personality assessments, I could do a whole thing about how your cold cut preferences reflect your relationship with authority!

Character 2: [laughing] Let's start with baby steps—maybe just a sign that says 'Warning: Counter service may include existential commentary.' [pause] But yes, I think we can make this work if you promise to dial it back just ten percent.
