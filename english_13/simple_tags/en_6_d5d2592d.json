            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[calmly] Your sales are impressive, absolutely, but we've received seventeen formal complaints in the past month alone. [pause] People are saying you told one customer their sandwich choice was 'a cry for help' and another that their meat selection 'screamed unresolved childhood trauma.'"

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[patiently] That may be true for him, but Mrs. Henderson left in tears when you apparently suggested her turkey order meant she was 'settling for mediocrity in all aspects of life.' [clearing throat] She's been a customer for twelve years."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[quickly] Mrs. Henderson needed to hear that! [passionately] She comes in every Tuesday, orders the exact same bland sandwich, and stares out the window like she's watching her dreams die. [softly] I was trying to help."

            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[passionately] Because I see the same dead-eyed people ordering the same dead-end sandwiches day after day! [exhales] When someone orders pastrami with horseradish, they're alive, they're taking risks, they're actually tasting something."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[gently] I hear what you're saying, and honestly, your passion is admirable. [warmly] But corporate has specific customer service standards, and telling people their sandwich choices reflect their fear of commitment isn't among them."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[sarcastically] Oh, corporate standards, right—smile, slice, serve, repeat. [bitter] Never mind that I've increased foot traffic by thirty percent or that we're selling premium cuts at twice the rate of last year."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[analytically] Those numbers are precisely why we're having this conversation instead of a termination meeting. [pause] But I need you to understand that your approach, while effective for sales, is creating liability issues we can't ignore."

            "role": "Character 1",

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
