            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[apologetic] No, it was completely fair, and I deserved that. [very quietly] I panicked, Danny, I saw that A&R guy's card and suddenly all I could think about was becoming another cautionary tale about failed musicians. [exhales] So I ran."
