Scenario: A heavy equipment operator working on a military base construction project must testify before a military judge about what he witnessed the night a soldier went AWOL and allegedly committed sabotage.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I already told the MPs everything I saw that night, three different times actually, and now you're dragging me away from my job site to go through it all again. [frustrated] My crew's behind schedule because of this.

Character 2: [firmly] Mr. Kowalski, this is a formal Article 32 hearing, not a casual interview. [pause] Your testimony could determine whether Sergeant Williams faces twenty years in military prison for sabotage and desertion.

Character 1: [defensive] Look, I was just running my bulldozer near the motor pool around 2300 hours like the contract specified. [sighs] Night work pays better and there's less brass around asking questions about every little thing.

Character 2: [stern] The surveillance footage shows you stopped your equipment at 2317 hours and walked toward Building 42. [slowly] That's the same building where the explosive devices were later discovered.

Character 1: [angry] I stopped because I saw someone in ACUs carrying something heavy toward that building! [loudly] What was I supposed to do, just keep grading dirt while watching potential theft on a military installation?

Character 2: [calmly] Please describe exactly what you observed about this individual's appearance and behavior. [formally] Remember, you're under oath and perjury carries serious consequences even for civilian contractors.

Character 1: [quietly] The guy was maybe five-ten, moving real careful like he didn't want to be seen. [pause] He kept looking over his shoulder every few steps, had a duffel bag that seemed way too heavy for normal gear.

Character 2: Did you recognize this person as Sergeant Williams, whom you'd seen multiple times during your three months working on base? [waiting] The prosecution claims you positively identified him to investigators.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I said it looked like Williams, but the lighting was terrible and he had his patrol cap pulled low. [exhales] I'm not going to sit here and swear a man's life away based on a shadow I saw for thirty seconds.

Character 2: [empathetically] Mr. Kowalski, I understand your reluctance, but we need clarity here. [firmly] Did you or did you not tell Staff Sergeant Chen that you were "ninety percent sure" it was Williams?

Character 1: [bitter] Ninety percent sure.

Character 2: [quickly] That's a yes then. [formally] Now, you mentioned in your second statement that you heard Williams arguing with Lieutenant Morrison earlier that day about deployment orders, is that correct?

Character 1: [reluctantly] Yeah, they were going at it near the equipment shed while I was doing maintenance on my excavator. [sighs] Williams kept saying something about not abandoning his sick kid for another tour.

Character 2: [sympathetically] His daughter has leukemia, that's in his personnel file. [pause] But personal hardship doesn't justify sabotaging military vehicles that other soldiers depend on for their safety.

Character 1: [frustrated] I'm not defending what he allegedly did, Judge, but I've been around desperate people before. [quietly] When you're backed into a corner watching your kid suffer, rational thinking goes out the window.

Character 2: [firmly] That's for the panel to consider during sentencing if he's convicted. [formally] Right now, I need to know if you saw anyone else in that area between 2300 and 2400 hours.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] There was a maintenance truck that drove past around 2340, but it had its lights on and was moving at normal speed. [remembering] Nothing suspicious about it, just routine night shift from what I could tell.

Character 2: [curious] Did you happen to note the vehicle number or recognize the driver? [quickly] Every detail matters when we're trying to establish a timeline of events.

Character 1: [tired] Judge, I've been over this so many times I'm starting to doubt my own memory. [sighs] But no, I didn't catch the truck number because I was already walking back to my dozer by then.

Character 2: [reassuringly] Your testimony has been consistent across all interviews, Mr. Kowalski, that speaks to your credibility. [formally] This court appreciates your cooperation despite the inconvenience to your work schedule.
