Scenario: A telephone lineman is forced to repair communication lines at the palace of a deposed tyrant who is under house arrest awaiting his war crimes trial.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [formally] The international tribunal requested we restore your communication lines before the trial proceedings begin next week. [pause] I'll need access to the main junction box in your east wing, and I'll be working here for the next few hours.

Character 2: So they send a common laborer to wire my prison. [bitter] Twenty years ago, I had thousands of men like you building entire communication networks across this nation, and now you come here to give me a single telephone line.

Character 1: [firmly] I'm just here to do a job, nothing more. [clearing throat] The sooner you show me where the junction box is, the sooner I can leave and you can make whatever calls they're allowing you.

Character 2: [melancholic] Do you know what I used these lines for before? [sighs] I spoke to presidents, to generals who commanded armies, to business titans who moved billions with a single word from me.

Character 1: [quietly] I know what you used them for.

Character 2: [defensive] You know nothing! The Western media feeds you lies about mass graves and torture chambers, but they never mention the hospitals I built, the literacy programs, the fact that we had the lowest infant mortality rate in the region under my leadership.

Character 1: [angry] My brother-in-law disappeared after protesting your grain requisitions in '09. [very quietly] His family still doesn't know where his body is buried, so don't lecture me about your achievements while children went hungry to build your palaces.

Character 2: [dismissive] Sacrifices had to be made for progress. [pause] Your brother-in-law chose the wrong side of history, and history is written by those with the strength to shape it, not by telephone repairmen.

Character 1: [controlled] History's being rewritten right now, isn't it? [sarcastically] You're about to go from 'Supreme Leader for Life' to 'Defendant Number One' in front of the whole world, all broadcast through these very lines I'm installing.

Character 2: [very quietly] They can try me, execute me if they wish, but my legacy will outlive their tribunals. [sighs] Monuments fall, but ideas persist, and there are still millions who remember when this country stood for something more than being another Western puppet state.

Character 1: [frustrated] Your legacy is mass graves and starving villages! [exhales] But I'm not here to argue politics with a dead man walking, just point me to the junction box.

Character 2: [melancholic] Down the hall, third door on the left, though I doubt you'll find what you're looking for. [quietly] The rats have been at the wiring for years now, just like they've been at everything else in this crumbling palace.

Character 1: [professionally] I've dealt with worse conditions in war zones, which ironically, most of them exist because of men like you who thought they could reshape the world through fear and violence. [pause] The wiring will work when I'm done.

Character 2: [bitter] Fear and violence? [laughs] Your democratic heroes drop bombs from drones on wedding parties and call it spreading freedom, but when I maintained order in my own borders, suddenly I'm the monster.

Character 1: [firmly] The difference is accountability, something you're about to learn about firsthand when you're sitting in that defendant's chair. [quietly] Your phones will work perfectly for your lawyer calls, for what good they'll do you.

Character 2: Tell me, lineman, when you're splicing those wires together, do you ever think about how many last words have traveled through copper lines like these? [melancholic] How many final goodbyes, how many pleas for mercy that went unheard?

Character 1: [coldly] I think about the families who never got to say goodbye because of men like you. [sighs] But today I'm just thinking about doing my job and getting out of here before the stench of this place follows me home.

Character 2: [resigned] The junction box is actually behind a portrait of my father in the hallway. [very quietly] He was a tyrant too, they say, though he only killed his enemies, not his friends like I learned to do.

Character 1: [level] I'll find it and get the work done within the hour, then you can call whoever still takes your calls. [pause] The guards told me you're allowed three international calls per week now, supervised of course.

Character 2: [melancholic] Three calls to a world that's already forgotten me except as a cautionary tale. [exhales] Fix your wires, lineman, and leave me to practice my defense for judges who've already decided my fate.
