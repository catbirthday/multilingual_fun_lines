Scenario: A guitar tech arrives to repair a vintage guitar at a wedding venue, only to discover the catering sales manager is their former bandmate who abandoned their musical dreams for a stable career.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] So, um, they said someone needed a '59 Gibson repaired for the wedding ceremony, but I didn't expect to find you here in a suit and tie. [pause] Marcus? Is that really you after all these years?

Character 2: [very quietly] Danny. [clearing throat] Wow, I should've known when they mentioned bringing in the best guitar tech in the city. [nervously] You're still working with instruments then, that's... that's good.

Character 1: [warmly] Still working with them, yeah, just not playing them on stage anymore, you know? [sighs] But look at you, catering sales manager at the Grandview—that's a pretty big deal, I guess.

Character 2: [quickly] It pays the bills, provides health insurance, lets me sleep in the same bed every night instead of, um, crashing on venue floors. [defensively] Some of us had to grow up eventually, Danny.

Character 1: [softly] We both grew up, Marc.

Character 2: [regretful] Yeah, I suppose we did.

Character 1: [curious] Do you ever, like, think about what would've happened if you hadn't walked out that night before the label showcase? [exhales] I mean, everything kind of fell apart after that, the whole band just dissolved.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Every single day, actually, especially when I'm booking these wedding bands who play the same covers we used to mock. [laughs bitterly] Sometimes I hear a guitar being tuned and I literally have to leave the room.

Character 1: [gently] You know, I kept your old Stratocaster in my shop for probably three years, thinking you'd come back for it. [trailing off] Eventually I sold it to some kid who reminded me of you...

Character 2: [very melancholic] That Strat was the first real guitar I ever owned, saved up for two summers to buy it. [sighs] But keeping it would've been torture, just sitting there reminding me of everything I gave up.

Character 1: [questioning] But did you really give it up, or did you just, I don't know, redirect it? [thoughtfully] You're still creating experiences for people, making their special days memorable, that's not so different from what we wanted to do with music.

Character 2: [frustrated] Come on, Danny, arranging shrimp towers and wine pairings isn't exactly the same as writing songs that could change someone's life. [pause] We both know that's just something I tell myself to sleep at night.

Character 1: [empathetically] Hey, we all tell ourselves things to get through, you know? [softly] I fix broken guitars instead of playing them because I convinced myself it's still being part of the music, but honestly, some days I can barely stand to hear them play.

Character 2: [surprised] You stopped playing? [confused] But you were the best guitarist I ever knew, Danny, you had that thing, that spark that made people stop whatever they were doing just to listen.

Character 1: [bitter] Yeah well, turns out that spark doesn't pay rent when your lead singer and best friend disappears two hours before the most important gig of your life. [sighs heavily] Sorry, that wasn't fair.

Character 2: [apologetic] No, it was completely fair, and I deserved that. [very quietly] I panicked, Danny, I saw that A&R guy's card and suddenly all I could think about was becoming another cautionary tale about failed musicians. [exhales] So I ran.

Character 1: You know what the really messed up part is? We probably would've failed anyway, but at least we would've failed together, and maybe that would've been enough somehow.

Character 2: [warmly] There's a piano in the venue's east wing that nobody ever uses, it's perfectly tuned. [hesitantly] I mean, if you have time after fixing the Gibson, maybe we could, um, I don't know, just play something?

Character 1: [chuckling] Marcus Chen, the man who schedules every minute of every event, suggesting we spontaneously jam? [excited] Yeah, okay, let me just restring this old girl and we'll see if either of us remembers how.

Character 2: [relieved] I remember everything, Danny, every chord change, every harmony we worked out in your garage. [very sincerely] Maybe that's the real torture, having perfect recall of the life you walked away from. [pause] But yeah, let's play.
