=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] I thought you moved to Portland, or was it Seattle? [nervous laugh] Sorry, I'm just surprised to see you here, especially looking so... different, good different, just different from how I remember.

Character 2: [warmly] Neither actually, I've been in Denver for the past three years. [pause] You look exactly the same though, down to that nervous thing you do with your hands when you're uncomfortable.

Character 1: [anxiously] Do I really still do that? God, I thought I'd grown out of some of my tells by now. [sighs] Therapy was supposed to help with the obvious ones at least.

Character 2: [gently] Therapy? Good for you.

Character 1: [quickly] Yeah, twice a week.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Listen, I know we haven't talked since that whole mess five years ago, but seeing you here tonight [exhales] brings back a lot of things I thought I'd processed already.

Character 1: [shaky voice] I know.

Character 2: [frustrated] You always did that, just agreed with whatever I said without actually engaging. [pause] Some things really don't change, even after all this time apart.

Character 1: You're right, I'm doing it again, falling into old patterns like we never stopped being us. [laughs bitterly] The therapist calls it regression, happens when I'm around certain triggers.

Character 2: Am I a trigger now? [quietly] That's not exactly what anyone wants to be called by someone they once thought they'd marry.

Character 1: [desperately] No, that came out wrong, you're not a trigger, you're... [sighs] You're the reason I needed therapy in the first place, but not in the way that sounds either.

Character 2: [bitter] Great, so I broke you?

Character 1: [firmly] No, I was already broken, you just made me realize it. [pause] The way I needed you, depended on you for everything, that wasn't love, it was something else entirely.

Character 2: [softly] It felt like love to me, at least at the beginning. [sighs] Before it became suffocating, before I realized I was losing myself trying to be your everything.

Character 1: [regretful] I'm sorry.

Character 2: [warmly] I know you are, and honestly, I forgave you years ago. [chuckles] Denver has been good for that, lots of mountains to climb and think about what really matters.

Character 1: [curious] Are you happy there? [quietly] I mean, really happy, not just the surface level stuff you post on Instagram that I definitely don't check every few months.

Character 2: [laughing] You still check my Instagram? [pause] Yeah, I'm happy, found someone who lets me be myself without needing me to complete them, if that makes sense.

Character 1: [sad] That's good, really good actually, and I mean that without any of the old jealousy. [exhales] Maybe we both ended up exactly where we needed to be.

Character 2: [sincerely] Maybe we did.
