=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [overly polite] Oh, hello there! [cheerful] I didn't expect anyone to still be working backstage after the premiere ended so abruptly with that unfortunate electrical malfunction.

Character 2: [stern] Cut the act, I saw you in the rigging loft thirty minutes before the screening. [firmly] You were messing with the DMX cables and the main power distribution, and we both know that's what caused the blackout.

Character 1: [innocently] I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, I was simply looking for my dear sibling to wish them luck on their big night. [condescending] You must have me confused with someone else.

Character 2: [angry] I've been running lights for twenty years, and I know sabotage when I see it. [loudly] You reversed the phase sequence on purpose, knowing it would trip the breakers right at the climax of the film. [pause]

Character 1: [fake concern] That sounds absolutely dreadful, what a terrible accident! [sarcastically] I'm sure my twin is devastated that their precious little vanity project got ruined in front of all those critics and investors.

Character 2: [confidently] Accident my ass, you knew exactly which circuits controlled the main theater. [firmly] I watched you study the electrical diagrams I left on my workbench last week when you were supposedly here for a 'friendly visit.'

Character 1: [mocking] You're quite the detective, aren't you? [laughs] But good luck proving anything when all you have is the word of some blue-collar electrician against someone with my family's reputation and resources.

Character 2: [very quietly] Here's the thing you didn't count on—I installed security cameras in the rigging loft last month after equipment started going missing. [triumphantly] Got you on video, clear as day, with timestamps and everything.

Character 1: Security cameras? [nervous laugh] That's ridiculous, there's no way you could have footage of something that never happened, and besides, twins look identical, so how could anyone prove which one of us it was?

Character 2: [boldly] Your twin was on stage doing sound check at that exact time, surrounded by fifty crew members. [sternly] Plus, you're wearing that distinctive scar on your hand from when you tried this shit at their gallery opening last year.

Character 1: [furious] You self-righteous little nobody, you think you can threaten me? [very loudly] My twin has been stealing my life since we were children, taking everything that should have been mine!

Character 2: [calmly] That's your problem to work out in therapy, not by destroying their career. [firmly] I'm giving you two options: leave town tonight and never come near any production your twin is involved in, or I hand this footage to the police. [sighs]

Character 1: [bitterly] You're making a huge mistake, choosing their side like everyone always does. [quietly] They're not the innocent victim you think they are, they've just gotten better at hiding their true nature.

Character 2: [empathetically] Maybe there's history between you two that I don't understand, but sabotaging someone's work isn't justice. [firmly] It's just petty revenge that makes you look like the villain you're trying so hard not to be.

Character 1: Villain? [laughs bitterly] That's rich, coming from someone who's been enabling their narcissistic behavior by lighting them like some kind of god for the cameras, feeding their desperate need for attention and validation.

Character 2: [frustrated] I light actors, it's my job, not some conspiracy to boost anyone's ego. [loudly] Your twin earned this premiere through years of hard work while you've been plotting in the shadows like some cartoon antagonist.

Character 1: [very quietly] Fine, you win this round, but don't think this is over. [coldly] One day everyone will see who they really are, and when that happens, remember that you had the chance to listen to me.

Character 2: [exhausted] Just go.

Character 1: [hateful] I'll leave, but not because you're threatening me with your pathetic footage. [sarcastically] I'm leaving because watching them fail on their own will be so much more satisfying than anything I could orchestrate myself.

Character 2: [relieved] Whatever helps you sleep at night, just stay away from my sets. [firmly] I've already sent copies of that footage to three different people with instructions to release it if anything happens to me or your twin's next project. [pause]
