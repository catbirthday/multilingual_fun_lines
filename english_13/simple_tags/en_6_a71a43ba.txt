Scenario: An account executive discovers their biggest client's retirement plan administrator is their estranged mother who abandoned the family twenty-three years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] So the Hartfield Industries account needs their entire retirement portfolio restructured by quarter end, which means we need to coordinate on the contribution limits and—wait. [pause] Mom? Is that really you sitting across from me?

Character 2: [very quietly] Twenty-three years, and this is how we meet again. [clearing throat] Your assistant scheduled this meeting without mentioning your last name, just said you were the lead AE on the account.

Character 1: [bitter] You recognize me?

Character 2: Of course I recognize you, Daniel. [shaky voice] You have your father's eyes but that determined set to your jaw, that's all me. Though I suppose you wouldn't want to hear that comparison.

Character 1: [coldly] We should focus on the account restructuring since that's why we're both here. [pause] The client wants to maximize their tax advantages while maintaining liquidity for their senior executives' early retirement options.

Character 2: [apologetic] Right, yes, the business at hand. [sighs] I've reviewed their current allocations and honestly, whoever set up their original plan did them no favors with those fee structures.

Character 1: [frustrated] That was actually my predecessor's work, but I'm the one who has to fix it now while keeping them happy. [quietly] Story of my life, really, cleaning up messes other people leave behind.

Character 2: [wincing] Daniel, I know what you're implying, and you have every right to be angry about—well, about everything. [pause] But this account, these people's retirements, they deserve better than our baggage affecting their futures.

Character 1: [sarcastically] How noble.

Character 2: Look, I can recommend moving their assets to a series of index-based target-date funds that would cut their fees by sixty percent. [quickly] It's the right move regardless of who's suggesting it or what you think of me personally.

Character 1: [reluctantly] That would actually solve most of their liquidity concerns too, and the board would love the fee reduction. [exhales] Fine, send me the fund prospectuses and we can present it together next week.

Character 2: [surprised] Together? [nervously] You want to do a joint presentation after this, after finding out who I am and what I did to you and your father?

Character 1: [firmly] I want to keep my biggest client happy and my commission intact, that's what I want. [pause] Whatever else this is, we can deal with after the contract is signed.

Character 2: You're right, of course, the client comes first. [sadly] I just want you to know that I've followed your career, Daniel. Every promotion, every success, I've watched from a distance, proud but knowing I gave up any right to tell you that.

Character 1: [angrily] You looked me up but never reached out? [voice breaking] Not once in twenty-three years, not even when Dad died and I was handling everything alone at seventeen?

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I wrote you letters, dozens of them, but I never sent them because what could I possibly say? [pause] 'Sorry I chose my career over my family' doesn't exactly fit on a Hallmark card.

Character 1: [exhausted] Just send me those fund options by tomorrow so I can review them before the weekend. [sighs] And include your direct line in case I have questions about the transition timeline.

Character 2: [warmly] I'll have everything in your inbox by close of business today, with my personal cell too. [hesitantly] Daniel, after this deal closes, would you maybe consider having coffee? No expectations, just—

Character 1: [interrupting] Let's just get through this.

Character 2: [very quietly] Understood. [pause] I'll make sure this is the smoothest retirement plan transition Hartfield has ever seen. It's the least I can do.
