=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I can't believe I have to present at this conference next week. Three hundred people watching me.

Character 2: That sounds really overwhelming. Is this your first time presenting at something this big, or have you done smaller conferences before?

Character 1: Just departmental meetings. Twenty people max.

Character 2: [cry] Oh, I completely understand that jump in scale feeling terrifying. What's your presentation about? Sometimes talking through the content helps calm those pre-conference nerves.

Character 1: Machine learning applications in climate modeling. I know my stuff, but my voice shakes.

Character 2: Your expertise will definitely shine through even if your voice wavers a bit. Have you thought about doing a practice run with friends? Most conference audiences are actually really supportive—they want you to succeed.

Character 1: My advisor says I overthink everything.

Character 2: [gasp] Wait, is your advisor Dr. Peterson? I heard she's presenting at the same conference! But seriously, overthinking is so common with first-time presenters—what specific part worries you most?

Character 1: The Q&A session. What if someone asks something I can't answer?

Character 2: That's the number one fear I hear from everyone. Here's what saved me: it's completely fine to say "That's a fascinating question, I haven't explored that angle yet." People respect honesty way more than fumbled attempts at answers.

Character 1: Did you bomb your first conference?

Character 2: I literally forgot my entire second slide and stood there frozen for what felt like hours. But you know what? The audience was incredibly kind, someone cracked a joke about coffee not kicking in yet, and I recovered.

Character 1: That sounds mortifying.

Character 2: It was, but it taught me that conference audiences are mostly fellow researchers who've been exactly where you are. Have you connected with anyone else presenting in your session? Sometimes having a friendly face helps.

Character 1: [slowly] There's this one person from MIT I've been emailing with.

Character 2: [cry] That's wonderful! Having even one ally in the room changes everything. When I presented at AGU last year, knowing just two people in that massive ballroom made such a difference to my confidence.

Character 1: AGU is huge. How many attended your talk?

Character 2: Around four hundred, but honestly after the first minute you stop seeing individual faces and it becomes easier. What time slot did you get for your presentation? Morning sessions tend to be more forgiving.

Character 1: [sleepily] 8 AM on the second day.

Character 2: Perfect timing actually—everyone will be too focused on their coffee to judge harshly! Plus early sessions mean you can enjoy the rest of the conference without that weight on your shoulders. Are you planning to attend the networking reception?
