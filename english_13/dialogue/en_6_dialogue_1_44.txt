=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Hey, I saw the email about the new referral program changes. You okay?

Character 2: [empathetically] Look, I get that corporate thinks this is going to boost numbers. But cutting our commission from fifteen percent to eight percent while expecting us to maintain the same referral volume? That's just not realistic.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] They're really doing this to us again, aren't they?

Character 2: [overly polite] Oh absolutely, they're being so generous with their new "tiered structure" that requires fifty referrals just to reach the old base rate. Meanwhile the CEO just bought his third yacht, but sure, let's tighten the belts on the people actually bringing in customers.

Character 1: Fifty referrals? That's impossible for most of us.

Character 2: [cry loudly] It's worse than impossible, it's insulting! They know the average rep brings in maybe twelve referrals a quarter, so this is basically a pay cut disguised as an "opportunity for growth."

Character 1: [condescending] Well maybe if we just worked harder like management suggests...

Character 2: Right, because the problem is definitely our work ethic and not the fact that they've systematically destroyed every incentive we had. Last year they cut the holiday bonuses, this year it's referrals, next year they'll probably charge us for using the office coffee machine.

Character 1: Did you see Sarah's already putting in her notice?

Character 2: Sarah's smart. She saw this coming when they started those "optimization meetings" three months ago. Half the sales team is already interviewing elsewhere, and honestly, I don't blame them one bit.

Character 1: What are you going to do?

Character 2: [shaky voice] I've got three kids and a mortgage, so walking away isn't exactly simple. But I'm done pretending this is acceptable. We built this referral network from nothing, and now they want to squeeze us for every penny.

Character 1: [exhausted] I'm just so tired of fighting this every quarter.

Character 2: The worst part is they'll act shocked when referral numbers tank next month. "Why aren't people motivated?" they'll ask, while sitting in their glass offices counting the money they saved by screwing us over.

Character 1: Think the union talks will go anywhere this time?

Character 2: Maybe. Jennifer from accounting says we've got enough signatures now, but you know how corporate plays dirty. They'll probably start offering selective raises to break solidarity, same playbook as always.

Character 1: God, that's exactly what they did last time.

Character 2: And it'll work again because people have bills to pay. That's the genius of their system - keep us desperate enough that we can't afford to fight back properly, but not quite desperate enough to riot.

Character 1: This is so messed up.

Character 2: The really messed up part? They sent that email at 4:47 on a Friday. They knew exactly what they were doing, dropping that bomb and running for the weekend while we all spiral.
