=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Is this supposed to be making that grinding noise?

Character 2: Ha! Oh man, that's just the, um, the rotor warming up—totally normal, I promise. Though I get why it sounds like we're in a giant blender, but trust me, these things are built like tanks that happen to fly.

Character 1: Why is the pilot wearing sunglasses indoors?

Character 2: [belly laugh] Okay, so either he thinks he's in Top Gun, which, honestly, fair, or he's actually just, uh, really committed to the aesthetic—but hey, at least he's not wearing the aviator scarf too, right?

Character 1: Should I be worried that there's duct tape on the door?

Character 2: [chuckle] Oh that's not—well, okay, it IS duct tape, but it's, er, aerospace grade duct tape, which is basically the Swiss Army knife of aviation fixes. NASA uses it, so if it's good enough for space, it's definitely good enough for us hovering over downtown.

Character 1: [laugh] Did he just cross himself before starting the engine?

Character 2: Hah, yeah, some pilots are, um, let's say "spiritually cautious"—but honestly I'd rather have one who's covering all the bases than one who's like, overconfident about defying gravity in a metal bubble.

Character 1: Why does my headset smell like cheese?

Character 2: [cough] Oof, yeah, those get, erm, a bit funky after hundreds of tourists—but think of it as, I don't know, building character? Or at least building immunity to whatever that smell actually is, which we've never quite figured out.

Character 1: Is that a barf bag or a souvenir bag?

Character 2: Oh it's, ah, it's brilliantly dual-purpose actually! Starts as a souvenir bag but can, you know, quickly transition to emergency use if someone gets a bit green—though honestly the logo placement becomes, mmm, pretty unfortunate at that point.

Character 1: [confidently] I bet I could fly this thing.

Character 2: Sure, sure! I mean, there's only like, what, seventeen different controls you're monitoring simultaneously while basically doing calculus in your head about wind speed and, uh, not crashing into buildings—piece of cake, really!

Character 1: Why is there a rubber duck on the dashboard?

Character 2: Ahh, that's Captain Quackers, our, er, unofficial co-pilot! Every helicopter has one—it's supposedly for checking airflow or something technical, but really I think pilots just get lonely up here and need a friend who won't judge their landing technique.

Character 1: [laugh loudly] Did we just get passed by a drone?

Character 2: Oh my god, yes! That happens, like, constantly now—nothing quite deflates the whole "marvel of human flight" thing like getting overtaken by some kid's Christmas present that probably cost less than our fuel for this trip.

Character 1: [sniffle] My ears feel like they're going to explode.

Character 2: Yeah, that's the, um, the pressure thing—try yawning really dramatically or pretend you're chewing gum, which sounds ridiculous but actually works. Or just scream, honestly, because between the rotors and the headsets, nobody's gonna hear you anyway!
