=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: How do you handle employees who constantly call out on weekends?

Character 2: [angry] Look, this is exactly the kind of thing that drives me up the wall—you have to document everything, every single absence, because HR won't let you do anything without a paper trail. It's so frustrating when you know someone's gaming the system but you can't just, like, call them out on it.

Character 1: [frustrated] But they always have some excuse ready.

Character 2: Oh absolutely, I mean, the creativity is almost impressive sometimes. You get the sudden flu, the car that mysteriously breaks down every Saturday, the, um, family emergency that somehow only happens during peak hours—after fifteen years in retail, I've heard them all.

Character 1: [stuttering] W-what if they're actually telling the truth though?

Character 2: [sniffle] That's... that's the hardest part, honestly. Because sometimes they really are going through stuff, and you don't want to be that manager who, you know, assumes the worst about everyone when someone's genuinely struggling.

Character 1: Do you have a three-strike policy or something?

Character 2: Mmm, we used to, but corporate changed it to this whole progressive discipline thing now. First it's a verbal warning, then written, then final written, and only then can you actually, uh, move toward termination—it takes literally months.

Character 1: What about just cutting their hours?

Character 2: Ooh, yeah, that's... that's technically retaliation and can get you in serious trouble. HR hammered that into us during the last training—you can't reduce hours as punishment, even though, honestly, it would solve so many problems.

Character 1: How do you stay motivated dealing with this stuff?

Character 2: Woof, some days I really don't, if I'm being honest. But then you get that one employee who actually wants to grow, who shows up early and asks questions, and it kind of, I guess, reminds you why you started doing this.

Character 1: Ever think about switching to corporate?

Character 2: Um, constantly, actually—the money's better, the hours are normal, no dealing with customers. But there's something about being on the floor, solving problems in real-time, that I'd probably miss, you know?

Character 1: What's your worst scheduling nightmare?

Character 2: [sneeze] Oh god, Black Friday two years ago—three people with the flu, two no-shows, and my assistant manager's car actually did break down. I was literally on the floor for eighteen hours straight, running between registers and the stockroom like a maniac.

Character 1: Did upper management even notice?

Character 2: Ha! They sent a, uh, congratulations email about hitting sales targets, no mention of the skeleton crew that made it happen. That's retail for you—they see numbers, not the chaos behind them.

Character 1: Would you recommend this career to someone starting out?

Character 2: [empathetically] Hmm, you know, despite everything I've just said, I think I would—but only if they understand it's not just about products and sales. It's really about people, and if you can't find meaning in developing your team and, like, genuinely helping customers, you'll burn out fast.
