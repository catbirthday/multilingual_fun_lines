=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Why are we meeting in this creepy old factory to discuss linguistics?

Character 2: Oh, well, I thought the acoustics would be interesting for, um, demonstrating some pragmatic principles. Plus, honestly, the department's conference rooms were all booked and this place has a certain... atmospheric quality that really emphasizes how context shapes meaning.

Character 1: Is that graffiti quoting Grice's Maxims?

Character 2: Ha! Yeah, someone spray-painted them last semester during that whole, uh, protest about funding cuts. The Cooperative Principle right there next to "DOWN WITH ADMIN" is actually kind of perfect—it's like a real-world violation of the Maxim of Relation, you know?

Character 1: This place feels like it's about to collapse. Are you sure we're safe?

Character 2: Mmm, probably? I mean, the structural engineers cleared it last month for that art installation. Anyway, let's talk about Austin's speech act theory—see how this dusty old space affects our illocutionary force when we're, like, constantly worried about tetanus.

Character 1: [cough] God, the dust. So what did you want to show me?

Character 2: Right, so, imagine you're Paul Grice giving a lecture in here versus, say, at Oxford. The implicatures change completely because the context is so radically different—your audience would interpret everything through this lens of, um, abandonment and decay.

Character 1: Are those footsteps upstairs?

Character 2: [stuttering] N-no, that's just the— the building settling, it does that. Look, Searle's taxonomy of illocutionary acts actually becomes really interesting in spaces like this because our commissives and expressives take on this whole different weight.

Character 1: You're using an abandoned factory for a linguistics experiment?

Character 2: Essentially, yeah. The way deixis works here is fascinating—when I say "here" or "now" in this space, it carries all these, uh, additional pragmatic layers that wouldn't exist in a normal classroom setting, you know?

Character 1: That broken window is making me nervous.

Character 2: Oh right, sorry. But actually, that's perfect for discussing Levinson's work on presumptive meanings—we're both presuming certain things about safety and, like, appropriateness just based on these environmental cues that have nothing to do with actual language.

Character 1: Did you seriously cite Stephen Levinson while we're trespassing?

Character 2: We're not— okay, we're kind of trespassing. But think about it: Horn's division of pragmatic labor is happening right now in how we're choosing our words more carefully because the setting makes everything feel, mmm, more consequential somehow.

Character 1: I think I just saw a rat.

Character 2: Yikes, probably. But hey, even that affects our conversational implicatures—like when Sperber and Wilson talk about relevance theory, the presence of, er, potential danger makes every utterance feel more loaded with meaning.

Character 1: [very sincerely] Can we please continue this discussion literally anywhere else?

Character 2: [speeding up] Yes absolutely, let's go, we can grab coffee and I'll explain how Goffman's face theory works way better when you're not worried about asbestos, come on, there's a exit this way I think.
