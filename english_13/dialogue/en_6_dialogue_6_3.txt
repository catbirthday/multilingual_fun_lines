Character 1: Did your family have any weird food traditions growing up?

Character 2: Actually yes, my grandmother used to make us eat pickled herring on New Year's Eve for good luck. Though I should clarify—it wasn't just eating it, we had to eat exactly twelve pieces at midnight while making wishes.

Character 1: [gasp loudly] Twelve pieces? That sounds intense!

Character 2: Well, okay, they were tiny pieces, like thumbnail-sized. I made it sound worse than it was. She'd cut them up super small and serve them on these little crackers with cream cheese to make it bearable for us kids.

Character 1: [exhausted] I can barely handle regular fish, let alone pickled.

Character 2: [delighted] Oh but that's the thing—when it's done right, pickled herring doesn't really taste fishy at all! It's more tangy and savory, almost like a really intense olive. Though I'll admit, the texture takes some getting used to.

Character 1: What happened if you didn't eat all twelve?

Character 2: Nothing dramatic, but my grandmother would get this look. Actually no, I'm misremembering—she'd just quietly mention how her mother did it through the Depression and two wars, which was way more effective than yelling would've been.

Character 1: [cry] That kind of guilt trip would destroy me.

Character 2: Right? Though honestly, looking back, I think she was just trying to keep the tradition alive. She'd lost so much of her culture immigrating here, and this was one small thing she could preserve and pass down.

Character 1: Do you still do it?

Character 2: I tried for a few years after she passed, but it felt hollow doing it alone. Wait, that's not entirely true—I did it once with my roommates in college, but they thought I was pranking them.

Character 1: [sigh] Food traditions are so personal.

Character 2: They really are. Although I should mention, the herring wasn't even the weirdest part. We also had to wear something red, keep coins in our pockets, and absolutely no cleaning on New Year's Day or you'd sweep away your luck.

Character 1: The no cleaning rule sounds amazing actually.

Character 2: Ha, you'd think so, but the anxiety of seeing dishes pile up was worse than just doing them. My grandmother would prep for days beforehand though, making sure everything was spotless by midnight so we wouldn't be tempted.

Character 1: Did any of the luck stuff ever work?

Character 2: Absolutely. Well, no, obviously not in any measurable way. But those years felt luckier because we were all together, being ridiculous, making these elaborate wishes over tiny pieces of fish.

Character 1: [condescending] Sounds like you miss the people more than the tradition.

Character 2: That's exactly it, actually. The herring was just an excuse to gather everyone in one room, to mark time passing, to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves. The fish was terrible, but the feeling was everything.
