=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I've been thinking about our employee stock ownership plan.

Character 2: [whispering loudly] Oh jeez, okay, we're doing this? Look, I'm gonna tell you something that could, erhm, probably get me fired, but you need to hear it—the ESOP here is basically a trap, alright?

Character 1: A trap? What do you mean?

Character 2: Well, so they make it sound amazing, right? Like, "own a piece of the company," but honestly the vesting schedule is brutal—five years before you get anything, and if you leave even one day early, poof, it's all gone.

Character 1: Five years seems standard though.

Character 2: Sure, yeah, except here's the thing they don't tell you—the shares are valued by, mmm, their own internal committee, not market rate, so you could be sitting on worthless paper for years without knowing it.

Character 1: That's... is that even legal?

Character 2: Technically? I mean, yeah, it's legal, but ethically it's, oof, it's pretty questionable. Plus they can dilute your shares anytime they want by issuing new ones to executives, which happens literally every quarter.

Character 1: How much have you lost?

Character 2: Woof, okay, so I had about 80k worth on paper two years ago, and now after three dilutions it's worth maybe, uhh, 22k? And that's if their valuations are even honest, which, honestly, I doubt.

Character 1: Should I just opt out entirely?

Character 2: [gasp softly] Wait, you haven't signed up yet? Oh thank god, listen, there's actually something else—they're planning a massive restructuring next month that nobody's supposed to know about.

Character 1: [trailing off] I was going to sign the paperwork tomorrow...

Character 2: No no no, don't! Look, I'm seriously risking my job here, but after the restructuring, those stock options are gonna be worth, like, basically nothing—they're converting to a different class of shares entirely.

Character 1: How do you know all this?

Character 2: [confused] Because I... wait, you really don't know who I am? I'm on the compensation committee, or well, I was until I started asking too many questions about the ESOP structure.

Character 1: [very sincerely] You're risking a lot telling me this.

Character 2: Yeah well, someone needs to warn people, right? They've already screwed over, hmm, probably sixty employees this year alone, and HR just keeps pushing the program like it's some golden ticket or something.

Character 1: What should I invest in instead?

Character 2: [jealous] Honestly? Just max out your 401k and buy index funds like everyone smart does—my brother did that instead and he's already retired at 45, meanwhile I'm stuck with worthless paper promises.
