Character 1: So I've been, um, thinking about getting into wine collecting. Is it—is it as pretentious as everyone says?

Character 2: Oh gosh, not at all! I mean, wine collecting is actually one of the most, er, magnificent investments you can make—both culturally and financially, you know? Like, when you hold a bottle of, say, a 1982 Château Latour, you're literally holding liquid history in your hands, which is, honestly, quite extraordinary when you really think about it.

Character 1: That sounds incredibly expensive though. How much are we talking here?

Character 2: [yawn] Well, see, entry-level collecting can start around, mm, five thousand or so for a decent starter cellar, but the real treasures—oh man, we're talking tens of thousands per bottle. I actually just sanctioned the purchase of a, uh, remarkable 1945 Romanée-Conti for a client last week, and that was, gosh, north of half a million, which sounds insane but it's basically buying a piece of art.

Character 1: Half a million?! For—for wine? That's, erhm, that's crazy!

Character 2: Ah, but think about it this way—these bottles are, like, rarer than most diamonds, and frankly, they offer something diamonds never could: the promise of an absolutely transcendent experience when you finally, you know, decide to open them. Plus, I mean, the appreciation rates on premier crus have been, er, consistently outperforming the stock market for decades now.

Character 1: Do you actually drink these wines or just, um, hoard them?

Character 2: Mmm, both, actually! The trick is to buy, ideally, three bottles of everything—one to drink young to understand its potential, one for that perfect moment of maturity, and one to, uh, keep forever as an investment. Though honestly, some of my clients have cellars worth more than their houses, which is, you know, absolutely their prerogative and I fully endorse it.

Character 1: What's the most extravagant wine experience you've, er, arranged for someone?

Character 2: Oh man, last year I orchestrated this, um, absolutely divine vertical tasting of Pétrus going back to 1961—we're talking about roughly two million dollars worth of wine consumed in one evening, but the joy on their faces? Priceless, truly. And, I mean, when you have that level of wealth, why not sanctify life's precious moments with something equally precious, right?

Character 1: That's—wow. Do you ever feel, like, guilty about the excess?

Character 2: Guilty? Gosh, no, never—I see myself as, erhm, facilitating these sublime experiences that, frankly, elevate the human spirit beyond the mundane. When I approve these purchases, I'm essentially giving people permission to, you know, touch greatness, to taste history, to own something genuinely magnificent that'll outlive them.

Character 1: But couldn't that money, um, help people instead?

Character 2: Well okay, see, my clients are actually incredibly philanthropic—they just happen to also appreciate the, er, finer things. And honestly, the wine industry employs millions globally, from vineyard workers to sommeliers, so when I sanction these purchases, I'm, mm, supporting an entire ecosystem of craftsmanship and tradition that's been refined over centuries.

Character 1: I guess that makes sense. What about, like, fake wines though? Is that a thing?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, counterfeits are, ugh, rampant in this world—that's why having someone like me to authenticate and, you know, officially sanction purchases is crucial. I've saved clients from, erhm, catastrophic mistakes, bottles that looked perfect but were actually clever forgeries worth nothing, which would've been, frankly, devastating both financially and emotionally.

Character 1: [meow] Sorry, my cat just jumped on my lap! Anyway, what—what credentials do you need for your job?

Character 2: Hah, well, beyond the Master of Wine certification, which took me, gosh, five years of absolute dedication, you need this, um, innate sense of taste, an encyclopedic knowledge of vintages and terroirs, and most importantly, the confidence to, er, authorize purchases that cost more than most people's annual salaries—it's not for the faint of heart, I can tell you that.

Character 1: [playful] Maybe I should just stick to my ten-dollar bottles from Trader Joe's then!

Character 2: [bored] Hey, look, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that—honestly, some of those bottles are, mm, perfectly serviceable for everyday drinking. But if you ever want to experience something truly transcendent, something that'll, you know, fundamentally change how you understand pleasure itself, well, that's when you come to someone like me for, er, proper guidance and sanctioning.
