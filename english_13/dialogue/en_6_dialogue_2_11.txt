=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: How do you approach designing a new interface?

Character 2: I start with forgetting everything. Every assumption, every pattern—gone. Then I watch real humans struggle with existing solutions and document their micro-frustrations; those tiny moments where their eyes narrow or fingers hesitate.

Character 1: [fast] That sounds incredibly time-consuming.

Character 2: Time is irrelevant when you're architecting cognitive flow. Most designers rush to pixels; I map neural pathways first. Each click should feel inevitable, like your brain predicted it before your finger moved.

Character 1: What's the biggest mistake you see other designers making?

Character 2: They design for themselves—clever people solving problems cleverly. But users aren't designers; they're exhausted parents at 11pm trying to pay bills. They need interfaces that think for them, not with them.

Character 1: Can you give me a specific example?

Character 2: [long pause] Password requirements. We force users to create complex passwords they'll forget, then shame them for writing them down. Real security isn't complexity; it's designing systems that align with human memory patterns—phrases, not P@$$w0rd123!

Character 1: But doesn't that compromise security?

Character 2: Security theater compromises security. A twenty-word passphrase someone remembers beats an eight-character nightmare they tape to their monitor. The interface should guide them toward naturally strong choices without friction.

Character 1: [joking] You make it sound like users are toddlers.

Character 2: Not toddlers—tired. Everyone's cognitively exhausted by 3pm. If your interface requires active thinking, you've already failed. Great design disappears; it feels like the computer reads your mind.

Character 1: [loudly] That's impossible though!

Character 2: Not impossible—invisible. Watch someone use Instagram; their thumb moves before conscious thought engages. That's not luck; it's thousands of iterations creating muscle memory. The interface trained their brain without permission.

Character 1: That's kind of creepy when you put it that way.

Character 2: All great design is manipulation. The question isn't whether you're controlling behavior—you are—it's whether you're doing it ethically. Are you helping them accomplish goals or exploiting dopamine loops for engagement metrics?

Character 1: How do you stay ethical?

Character 2: I design backwards from regret. Will someone feel good about this interaction tomorrow? Next month? If they'd be embarrassed explaining their usage pattern to a friend, I've built something predatory.

Character 1: That's a high bar.

Character 2: It should be. We're programming human behavior at scale; every modal, every notification, every loading animation shapes how millions think. That's either a responsibility or a weapon—designers choose which.
