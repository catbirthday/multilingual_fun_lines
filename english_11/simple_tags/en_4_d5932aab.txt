Scenario: An actor visits their former college roommate, now a grant writer for a struggling theater company, to discuss returning for one last performance that could save the venue from closing.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [warmly] So this is where you've been hiding for the past three years, writing grant proposals in a theater that's literally falling apart around you. [chuckles] The marquee outside is missing half its letters.

Character 2: [defensive] We're not hiding, we're surviving, and barely at that if I'm being honest with you. [sighs] Every grant I write gets rejected because we don't have a 'marquee performer' to anchor our season.

Character 1: [curious] Is that why you called me after all this time? [pause] Because you need someone with a recognizable name to save your little community theater from bankruptcy?

Character 2: [passionately] This isn't just some little community theater, and you know it! [frustrated] This is where we both got our start, where you played Hamlet for the first time when nobody else would cast you.

Character 1: [quietly] That was before Hollywood agents and seven-figure contracts and obligations to studios that control every minute of my schedule. [trailing off] Things are different now, you have to understand that...

Character 2: Things are different. [bitter]

Character 1: [apologetic] That's not fair.

Character 2: [upset] You promised you'd never forget where you came from, that you'd always make time for real theater, for the art that actually matters! [shaky voice] Now you're doing superhero movies and cologne commercials while we're about to lose everything.

Character 1: [frustrated] You think I wanted to become a brand instead of an artist? [loudly] Every morning I wake up in a house that doesn't feel like mine, memorizing lines for characters that have no soul!

Character 2: [skeptical] So come back then, just for one show, prove to the grant committees that we're worth saving. [pleading] Six weeks is all I'm asking for, one production of Death of a Salesman.

Character 1: [excited] Death of a Salesman? [laughs] God, I haven't done real theater in so long, the kind where you can actually feel the audience breathing with you.

Character 2: [hopeful] The foundation said if we can announce a notable lead by Friday, they'll reconsider our application for emergency funding. [nervously] That's enough to keep us open through next season and repair the roof.

Character 1: [conflicted] My agent will lose his mind if I tell him I'm walking away from pilot season to do regional theater. [sighs] But maybe that's exactly what I need to do.

Character 2: [cautiously] Don't make promises you can't keep, not again. [firmly] This theater has been running on hope and volunteer hours for two years, and I can't write another grant proposal selling dreams that won't materialize.

Character 1: [sincerely] When I left, I thought success meant getting as far from this place as possible. [emotional] But every award I win feels empty because none of you are there to celebrate with me.

Character 2: [softening] We watched your Oscar speech from the green room, all of us crammed around my laptop. [quietly] You thanked everyone except the place that made you who you are.

Character 1: [regretful] I know exactly what I didn't say that night, and it's haunted me ever since. [determined] Call the foundation, tell them you've got your marquee performer.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Are you absolutely sure about this? [anxious] Because if you back out, we won't get another chance, and I'll have to watch them turn this place into condos.

Character 1: [confidently] I'm sure, and I'll even pay for the roof repairs myself if the grant doesn't come through. [warmly] This place saved me once, now maybe I can return the favor.

Character 2: [emotional] You have no idea what this means to everyone here, to the kids in our youth program who worship you. [crying while speaking] Welcome home, you ridiculous Hollywood sellout.
