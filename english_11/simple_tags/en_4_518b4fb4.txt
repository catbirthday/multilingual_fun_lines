=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Alex? Is that—is that really you under all that dirt and, um, whatever else you've got covering your face? [quietly] Jesus, I haven't seen you in what, eight years?

Character 2: [exhausted] Hey Marcus. [sighs] Yeah, it's me. Guess this isn't exactly the reunion either of us pictured, huh? You in that uniform, me with, well, twelve people hiding in the back of my truck.

Character 1: [frustrated] Twelve people? Are you out of your mind? [louder] You know I have to report this, right? I mean, smuggling refugees across the border—that's not just illegal, it's... [trails off]

Character 2: [bitter] It's what? Wrong? [exhales] These are families, Marcus. Kids who haven't eaten in days. But sure, let's talk about what's legal while they're dying on the other side of your precious fence.

Character 1: [defensive] Don't do that. Don't make me the bad guy here. [firmly] I took an oath to protect this border, to maintain order. Without rules, without systems, everything just, um, falls apart.

Character 2: [very quietly] Like we did?

Character 1: [pause] That's not fair. [slowly] We were kids, Alex. We had dreams about changing the world together, but then you just disappeared, and I had to figure out my own way to, uh, to make a difference.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Oh, you're making a difference alright. [laughs] Sending desperate people back to die—that's really noble work you're doing here, buddy. Your mom would be so proud.

Character 1: [angry] Leave my mother out of this! [quieter] At least I'm trying to work within the system to help people, not just, errm, running around playing vigilante and making everything worse for everyone.

Character 2: [passionately] The system is broken, Marcus! It's been broken since before we were born. [sighs] I tried your way, remember? Three years in that refugee camp, filing paperwork, watching people die waiting for approval that never came.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I remember.

Character 2: [empathetically] Then you know why I do this. [very quietly] Every person I get across is someone's mother, father, child—someone who gets to live instead of becoming another statistic in your reports.

Character 1: [conflicted] Look, I... [exhales] I can give you five minutes before I have to call this in. That's all I can do. The cameras are on a loop for maintenance, but after that, I'm just another guard doing his job.

Character 2: Five minutes won't get us far enough. [desperately] Marcus, please. There's a six-year-old girl back there with a fever. Her parents carried her for three days through the desert.

Character 1: [whispering] Don't tell me that. [frustrated] Why do you have to make this so hard? I have a duty here, responsibilities—if I let you go and someone finds out, that's my career, my pension, everything gone.

Character 2: [sadly] Everything, huh? [pause] Remember when we used to say we'd never become the kind of people who valued security over doing what's right? Guess we both broke that promise in different ways.

Character 1: [defeated] Ten minutes. [sighs] I'm going to walk to the east checkpoint to investigate a, um, a sensor malfunction. When I get back, you better be gone, and we never saw each other.

Character 2: [relieved] Marcus, I—thank you. [quickly] I know this costs you something. Maybe more than you're letting on. But those twelve people, they'll remember this night for the rest of their lives.

Character 1: [firmly] Just go, Alex. [quieter] And don't come through my sector again. Next time, I won't be able to... I mean, there can't be a next time. [clears throat] Take care of yourself.

Character 2: [warmly] You too, old friend. [pause] Maybe someday when all this is over, when the world's different, we can have that beer we always talked about. [laughs softly] Until then, stay human in that uniform.
