=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] Mrs. Henderson? I knocked several times but the door was already open, and I noticed all these boxes in the hallway— [pause] Is everything alright with your mother?

Character 2: [exhausted] She's upstairs, probably pretending to sleep like she does every morning when she hears someone coming. [bitter] Twelve years I've been doing this dance with her, but not anymore.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I don't understand, are you moving? [quietly] Your mother never mentioned anything about relocating, and she usually tells me everything during our sessions.

Character 2: [firmly] My mother tells people what she wants them to hear. [sighs] Did she mention the three times she left the stove on last month, or how she accused me of stealing her jewelry that she'd hidden in the freezer?

Character 1: [very quietly] No, she didn't.

Character 2: [speaking fast] Of course she didn't, because then you'd have to report it, and then social services would get involved, and God forbid anyone think she's not perfectly capable of living independently.

Character 1: Mrs. Henderson, I've been caring for your mother for two years now, and while she has her moments, I've never seen anything that would suggest— [pause] Are you sure this is the right decision?

Character 2: [loudly] Right decision? [laugh] I haven't had a full night's sleep since 2012, haven't been on a date in five years, and my entire savings is gone from paying for her care.

Character 1: [empathetically] I understand this must be incredibly difficult for you, but moving her into a facility might not be what she needs right now. [gently] She's comfortable here, she knows this house.

Character 2: [bitter] This house is killing both of us. [very quietly] I found her wandering the neighborhood at three in the morning last week looking for my father—he's been dead for fifteen years.

Character 1: [shocked] She was wandering? [concerned] Mrs. Henderson, that's a serious safety issue, why didn't you call me or the agency?

Character 2: [defeated] Because then it becomes real, doesn't it? [sighs] Once you put it in a report, once it's documented, you can't pretend anymore that everything's going to magically get better.

Character 1: Your mother loves you more than anything in this world, she talks about you constantly during our time together. [softly] She's going to feel so abandoned.

Character 2: [angrily] Abandoned? [laughs bitterly] I gave up my career, my marriage, my entire life to take care of her, and she doesn't even remember my name half the time.

Character 1: [firmly] Memory loss doesn't erase love, Mrs. Henderson. [pause] Even if she can't express it the way she used to, somewhere deep inside, she knows you're her daughter.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] That's exactly why I can't do this anymore—watching her disappear piece by piece while I disappear right alongside her. [shaky voice] I need to exist again, I need to breathe.

Character 1: [very quietly] When are you planning to move her? [sighs] I should probably say goodbye properly, she's going to notice if I just stop coming.

Character 2: [whispering] Tomorrow morning.

Character 1: [slowly] Tomorrow? [upset] That's so soon, she won't have time to process this, to understand what's happening—you can't just rip her away from everything she knows without warning.

Character 2: [firmly] I can. [pause] I am.
