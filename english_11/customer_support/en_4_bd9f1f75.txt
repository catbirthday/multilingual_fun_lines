=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Wrong item. Again. Can't do this anymore.

Customer Support: Oh! Okay let me, um, pull up your account real quick... what's the order number?

Customer: ORD... hold on. 5582. KL9. Just... yeah.

Customer Support: Perfect, so I've got order ORD-5582-KL9 here and—oh interesting! Says here you ordered the Bluetooth speaker model BTS-400X. What'd you actually receive?

Customer: Some... headphones. Don't even know. Box says WH something.

Customer Support: WH! That's our, er, wireless headphone line. Let me see what... aha! Okay so basically what happened—this is actually kind of fascinating—your item got swapped at fulfillment center FC-7 in Memphis.

Customer: Great. So now what. I need the speaker. By Friday.

Customer Support: Right right, totally get it. Here's what I can do—and like, this is gonna work out great—I'm showing we have your BTS-400X speaker in stock at our distribution center just 18 miles from you.

Customer: Eighteen miles. Still gotta wait though.

Customer Support: Well here's the thing, uh, since this was our mistake? I'm authorizing same-day courier delivery. Should arrive by, hmm... system says 6:47 PM today.

Customer: Today? Actually today?

Customer Support: Yep! Driver code DC-890 will text you when they're 30 minutes out. Plus I'm issuing a return label—reference number RTN-7799823—for those headphones.

Customer: Oh. Okay that's... better. What about next time though.

Customer Support: So I'm actually, er, flagging your account with priority status code PS-GOLD. Basically means any future orders get double-checked at fulfillment. Won't happen again.

Customer: Double-checked. Sure. We'll see.

Customer Support: I know, I know—trust is earned. But look, your confirmation number for today's delivery is CNF-4421-QX. And my direct extension? It's 8847 if anything goes sideways.

Customer: Eight eight four seven. Got it. Thanks. I guess.

Customer Support: Oh! Almost forgot—those headphones you got by mistake? Model WH-750NC? They retail for 40 dollars more than your speaker. So, um, I'm adding a 40 dollar credit to your account.

Customer: Wait, credit? For real?

Customer Support: Absolutely! Credit code CRD-9982-V expires in 90 days. Should post within, like... checking... yeah, 2 to 3 business hours. Consider it an apology for the hassle.
