=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm really hoping you can help me because I'm completely lost here.

Customer Support: Oh! Policy confusion. Love these. Let me pull up. Your account. Real quick. Customer since 2019, account number ACC-4821-JV, and I can already see three orders this year.

Customer: Yeah exactly, I've been ordering forever and suddenly everything's different?

Customer Support: Right right. So. Big changes. October 15th. New return window dropped from 90 days to 30 days, and the free shipping threshold jumped from $35 to $75.

Customer: Wait, thirty days? I literally just tried to return something from September.

Customer Support: Ah! There it is. Order ORD-9924-LP from September 3rd. Yeah. Under old policy, you'd have until December 2nd. New policy cuts you off at October 3rd. Which was. Two weeks ago.

Customer: This is—I mean, I really needed to return this. My daughter can't even use it.

Customer Support: Okay okay. Here's what I'm seeing. The item—it's the art tablet for $189.99, right? So technically. Outside window. But. I'm checking your history here.

Customer: Did anyone even announce these changes? Because I check my email constantly.

Customer Support: So the announcement. Hmm. Email blast went out September 28th to all active customers, subject line "Important Account Updates," but our system shows only 12% open rate.

Customer: Of course it went to spam or something. This is just—sorry, I'm not mad at you.

Customer Support: No no, totally get it. Listen. I'm gonna—let me just—actually, you know what? Exception code EXC-7744-M lets me override return windows for customers with over 24 months history.

Customer: Oh my god, really? You're actually being so helpful right now.

Customer Support: Gets better. Since you missed the announcement—not your fault—I'm adding a courtesy credit of $15.00 to offset that new shipping threshold thing. Should post within 48 hours.

Customer: Wait, you can just do that? That's incredibly nice of you.

Customer Support: Trick is knowing which buttons. Return label RMA-5521-QZ is generating now. Should hit your email in about. Um. Five minutes? Ten max.

Customer: You know what, you've completely turned this day around. Seriously, thank you.

Customer Support: Best part? I'm noting your account so if any other old orders need returning before you knew about changes—just reference case number CSE-8823-YK.

Customer: That's so smart! Honestly, you should train everyone there.

Customer Support: Ha! Appreciated. But hey. Real quick. Want me to reactivate email notifications? Make sure nothing else sneaks past? Takes literally 30 seconds.
