=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Hi, um, I know this is probably annoying but I need my account history for like...

Customer Support: Oh no worries at all. Let me just... what's the word... authenticate you first. Can I get your account number? It should be something like ACC followed by eight digits.

Customer: Yeah it's ACC-48291056. So basically I need everything from January?

Customer Support: Got it, ACC-48291056... hmm, okay so here's the thing—our system is honestly kind of a pain with historical data. I can see—no wait, let me check something else—yeah, I can pull the last 90 days pretty easily.

Customer: Er, that's not gonna... I actually need six months back if that's...

Customer Support: Yeah I know, it's ridiculous right? The way they designed this... ugh. So what I can do is—hold on, there's a... what do you call it... a legacy report tool. Takes forever but it goes back to 2021.

Customer: Oh thank God. Um, I hate to be that person but...

Customer Support: No no, seriously don't even worry about it. I'm running report ID RH-7739-X2 right now. Between you and me? Half my day is fighting with these ancient systems. Estimated completion time is showing... eesh... 4 minutes.

Customer: Sorry, I just really need this for my accountant and...

Customer Support: Hey listen, I totally get it. Tax season is—let me just—actually you know what? While that's running, I can also generate form 1099-MISC if you need it. Document code would be DOC-99M-2024.

Customer: Would you? That would be so...

Customer Support: Already on it. So the account history will have... hmm... all transactions, fees, interest earned—basically everything from January 1st. Current balance is showing $12,847.29 as of today.

Customer: Perfect. And then the payments I made in March should be...

Customer Support: Yep, I see those—actually wait, there's something... no that's right. Three payments in March totaling $4,500.00. Transaction IDs are TXN-3847, TXN-3901, and TXN-3955.

Customer: Okay good, so those are all there then.

Customer Support: Mmm-hmm. Oh and just so you know—this is kinda dumb but—the report comes in like... what's the format... CSV only. No PDF option because apparently that's too modern for us.

Customer: That's fine, er, whatever works honestly.

Customer Support: Cool cool. Alright so... let me see here... report's done! Sending to your email on file, the one ending in 7745. Should hit your inbox in about 30 seconds.

Customer: You're literally saving my life here, um, thank you so much.

Customer Support: Oh please, this is the easiest call I've had all day. Honestly refreshing to help someone who's actually nice about it. Your confirmation number for this request is REQ-20240315-KJ8. Anything else I can dig up for you?
