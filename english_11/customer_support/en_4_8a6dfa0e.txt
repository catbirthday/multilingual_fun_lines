=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Let me see here... Order cancelled. Three weeks ago. Still no refund.

Customer Support: Oh gosh. Three weeks? That's—*exhales* I'm so sorry. Let me pull this up right away... What's the order number?

Customer: ORD dash—wait, sorry—eight seven two. Nine. XM.

Customer Support: Got it. ORD-8729-XM... *sharp inhale* Oh. I see what happened here. The refund, er, it got stuck in our payment processing system on November 2nd. That must be so frustrating...

Customer: Hmm, stuck. Of course. What if—no. Just tell me when.

Customer Support: Right. So. The good news—I mean, I can manually push this through. Takes about, um, 3-5 business days normally. But for you? Let me expedite...

Customer: Manually. Three to five days. For my own money. Fascinating.

Customer Support: I know. I know, it's—*exhales* Look. What I'm doing right now. Case number CSE-4412-B. Priority escalation. Should hit your account in, errr, 24 hours max.

Customer: Twenty four hours. Okay so that means... tomorrow afternoon then?

Customer Support: Tomorrow by 3PM Eastern. Absolutely. And I'm—wait no, let me also... adding a $15 credit. For the hassle.

Customer: Wait. You're actually—fifteen dollar credit? That's... unexpectedly decent of you.

Customer Support: *soft exhale* Listen. Three weeks is inexcusable. The original amount, $287.43, plus that credit. All hitting your card ending in 4782 tomorrow.

Customer: Let me think... yeah, 4782, that's the right card. Thank you. Genuinely.

Customer Support: Of course! And, uh, here's my direct extension. 5509. If it doesn't show by 3PM tomorrow...

Customer: Five five zero nine. Got it. You've been—I mean, you actually helped.

Customer Support: That's what I'm—I mean, I get it. Money stuck in limbo is... *trails off* Anyway. Is there anything else?

Customer: Hmm, what if this happens again? With future orders?

Customer Support: So! Good question. I'm flagging your account—code RFP-PRIORITY. Basically ensures faster processing. Any future refunds? 48 hours maximum. No more waiting.

Customer: RFP priority. Okay so that's... permanent? On my account? That's incredibly helpful, actually.

Customer Support: Permanent. Yes. And, erhm, I put detailed notes. Transaction ID TXN-9982-QV7 has everything documented. Next agent sees this? They'll know exactly what happened.
