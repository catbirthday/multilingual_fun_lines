=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Wait. Different department? But I called. The main number. They said billing.

Customer Support: Oh, I can absolutely see why that's frustrating—so I'm looking at your account here, customer ID CX-4829-MNP, and I think what happened is they routed you to us for billing inquiries but this is actually a technical issue that needs our specialized team.

Customer: Technical? No no. It's charging me. Wrong amount. Every month.

Customer Support: Right, I totally get the confusion because it does involve charges, but the recurring billing error code RB-7742 that's showing on your account from November 14 through today, that's actually a system glitch that only our technical support folks have the tools to fix, which I know is probably not what you want to hear.

Customer: So I just. Start over? Again? Third time today?

Customer Support: I know, it's kind of ridiculous that we can't just handle everything in one place—let me at least make this easier by doing a warm transfer to extension 5509 so you won't have to explain everything from scratch again, and I'll put notes in your file right now.

Customer: What's a... what do you call it... warm transfer?

Customer Support: Oh sorry, that's when I stay on the line and personally introduce you to the tech support agent, explain your issue myself, reference number TKT-9883-QWE, make sure they have all your information pulled up, basically I'll stick around until you're all set with them.

Customer: That's. Better. I guess. Will they actually fix it?

Customer Support: I mean, honestly? They should be able to resolve this in about 15 to 20 minutes since it's error code RB-7742, but if for some reason they can't, here's what I'm going to do—I'm putting a priority flag PF-2847 on your account that basically escalates any future calls straight to management.

Customer: I'm probably. Making this harder than it needs to be. Sorry.

Customer Support: No no no, you're not making anything harder—our phone system is sort of a maze sometimes, and the fact that you've been transferred twice already for something that started at 2:47 PM according to my notes? That's on us, not you.

Customer: Just frustrated. Wedding venue. They need the subscription working.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: Wait. You can see. How long I've been calling?

Customer Support: Yeah, I can see your whole call history today—first call at 2:47 PM to general support, transferred at 3:02 PM to sales, then to me at 3:18 PM, and honestly that's way too long for what should probably be a quick fix once you reach the right department.

Customer: The... what's the word... authentication thing. Keeps failing.

Customer Support: Okay that's definitely technical territory, probably an API issue with token AU-5573-XMP, but here's what I think we should do—I'm dialing extension 5509 right now, and when Josh answers, I'll explain everything including the wedding venue deadline so he knows this is time-sensitive.

Customer: Josh. Okay. He knows this stuff?

Customer Support: Oh absolutely, Josh is kind of our go-to for recurring billing glitches, handles probably 30 of these a day, and between you and me? If anyone can get this sorted before your 5 PM deadline today, it's going to be him—connecting now, just stay with me one more second.
