=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You have really beautiful eyes, you know that?

Character 2: [cry loudly] Nobody's said that to me in years. Most people just see the body, the performance, never actually look at my face.

Character 1: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

Character 2: No no, these are good tears. You'd be surprised how rare genuine compliments are in my line of work. Everything's usually about measurements and moves.

Character 1: How long have you been dancing?

Character 2: Seven years this December. Started right after my daughter was born, needed the money fast and it was the only job that paid enough for childcare and rent.

Character 1: You have a daughter?

Character 2: Mia, she's seven now. Smart as hell, already reading at a fourth grade level. Her teachers say she's gifted but I already knew that.

Character 1: [anxious] Does she know what you do?

Character 2: She thinks I'm a night shift nurse. The hours match up and it explains why I sleep during the day. I'll tell her the truth when she's older, when she can understand nuance.

Character 1: That must be hard, keeping that secret.

Character 2: [long pause] The hardest part is missing bedtime stories. I record myself reading her favorite books so she can listen when I'm at work. She says my voice helps her sleep better than anything.

Character 1: You're a good mom.

Character 2: [laugh loudly] A good mom who takes her clothes off for money? That's a new one. Most people think those two things can't coexist in the same person.

Character 1: I think you're doing what you have to do.

Character 2: [very sincerely] You're different from the usual crowd. Most guys either pity me or fetishize me, but you're just talking to me like I'm a regular person.

Character 1: You are a regular person.

Character 2: [confidently] I make more than most corporate managers, actually. Put away fifteen thousand just this year for Mia's college fund. This job won't last forever but her education will.

Character 1: Can I buy you a real drink? Not a work drink?

Character 2: My shift ends at two. There's a 24-hour diner three blocks down that makes incredible pancakes. Meet me there if you're serious about seeing who I actually am.
