=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're the meteorologist they brought in for this exercise?

Character 2: Oh yeah, that's me! Um, I do this twice a week now, actually. We use weather data for cognitive exercises, which sounds weird but it's, like, surprisingly effective for memory work and, uh, pattern recognition.

Character 1: How does reading numbers help exactly?

Character 2: Well, so, we start with barometric pressure readings—29.92, 30.15, 29.88—and patients track the patterns, you know? It's basically like brain training but with real data that actually means something, which apparently helps with retention.

Character 1: Are those today's readings?

Character 2: Mmm, no those are from last Tuesday's storm system. Today we're at, let me see... 30.21, which is really high pressure, means we're gonna have beautiful weather for the next, oh, probably 72 hours or so.

Character 1: [regretful] I used to love tracking weather patterns before... all this.

Character 2: Hey, that's actually perfect then! We can start with something familiar, maybe, um, temperature variations? So like, 68, 71, 74, 77—see how it's climbing in increments of three? That's your typical morning warming pattern.

Character 1: That's from this morning?

Character 2: [over confidently] Oh absolutely, I've been tracking every single hour since 4 AM! The dew point's been holding steady at 52, 52, 53, 52, which tells me we're in this really stable air mass that's just, like, perfect for recovery activities.

Character 1: You track it that closely?

Character 2: [groan] Ugh, yeah, it's kind of obsessive, I know. But when you've been doing meteorology for fifteen years, you start seeing numbers everywhere—wind speed at 12, gusting to 18, humidity at 45 percent, it's just... it never stops.

Character 1: Is that exhausting?

Character 2: Mmm, sometimes? But here's the thing, when I started volunteering here, I realized these patterns actually, er, help people focus on something concrete, you know? Like, tomorrow's forecast shows 85, 83, 79, 76—that downward trend is soothing somehow.

Character 1: [angry] Those numbers don't mean anything to me anymore!

Character 2: Whoa, okay, I hear you. Let's, um, let's try something different then. How about we just count cloud cover percentages? Really simple—10, 20, 30, 40—just basic increments, nothing fancy, nothing that needs to mean anything special.

Character 1: [clearing throat] Sorry, I didn't mean to snap.

Character 2: Oh man, no, don't apologize! Honestly, half the people here tell me to stuff my barometer where the sun don't shine, which is, uh, ironically a meteorological impossibility but I get the sentiment.

Character 1: [cough] Can we try the pressure readings again?

Character 2: Yeah, absolutely, let's do it. So we'll start nice and easy—29.92, 29.94, 29.96—just tiny little changes, like breathing actually, inhale and exhale, the atmosphere does the same thing and, hmm, that's kind of beautiful when you think about it.
