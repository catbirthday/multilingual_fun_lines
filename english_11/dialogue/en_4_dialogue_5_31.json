            "content": "That's really kind of you to say! The key was looking at policy shifts in smaller markets first—Estonia and Uruguay were early indicators of what would happen globally. Once you spot those patterns in pioneering countries, the larger markets tend to follow within eighteen to twenty-four months."

            "content": "I focus on countries with high education levels but limited natural resources—they're forced to innovate faster. Singapore for fintech, Israel for agtech, Denmark for wind energy. These pressure cooker environments create solutions that eventually get adopted everywhere else once the technology costs drop."

            "content": "They have more data, absolutely, but that can actually be a disadvantage. Big companies get paralyzed by analysis, while I can pivot my entire research focus in a day if I spot something interesting. Last month I completely shifted to studying battery recycling because of one conversation with a startup founder in Taiwan."

If that scales, it completely changes the economics of EVs because suddenly we're not dependent on new mining operations. The implications are massive for supply chain stability."

The best research takes time to properly validate, but I'm optimistic we'll have something concrete by March. It's exciting to be documenting something that could fundamentally reshape an entire industry."

They see problems months before executives do. Plus, I track patent filings in multiple languages since some of the best innovations never get translated to English initially."

I was so focused on traditional agriculture automation that I ignored all the signs from Japan and Singapore. That taught me to never dismiss something just because it seems too expensive initially—costs can drop faster than anyone expects."

But seriously, maintaining independence means turning down a lot of money, which is worth it because credibility is everything in this field. Once you lose that trust, you never really get it back."

The talent pool is there, the government incentives just kicked in, and major players are quietly moving operations. We're watching the beginning of the biggest supply chain rebalancing since globalization started."

My job is catching those moments right before they happen, and honestly, there's nothing more satisfying than helping people prepare for changes that seem impossible until they're inevitable."
