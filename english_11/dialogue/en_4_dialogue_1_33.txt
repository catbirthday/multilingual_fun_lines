=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [slurring] I need someone to help me write songs for my musical about competitive eating.

Character 2: Oh wow, uh, that's actually a pretty unique concept you've got there. I mean, competitive eating as a musical—that's something I haven't heard before, and honestly, I'm kind of intrigued by how you'd, you know, turn hot dog contests into show tunes.

Character 1: [very excited] You could do it? You could actually help me make this happen?

Character 2: Well, I've written comedy songs before, sure, but this would be, mmm, definitely new territory for me. The thing is, I'd need to really understand your vision first—like, are we talking full Broadway parody or more of an intimate, um, character-driven piece?

Character 1: It's about a woman who discovers she has this gift for speed-eating.

Character 2: Ahh, okay, so there's an actual narrative arc here, not just, like, gags about food. That's good, that gives us something to work with emotionally, and I think, uh, the contrast between this absurd talent and real human struggle could be really compelling actually.

Character 1: But I can't write music. I only have the story.

Character 2: Right, right, so you'd need someone to handle the entire musical composition side of things. Look, I could probably do that, but it's gonna take, err, significant time—we're talking months of work here, not weeks.

Character 1: How much would you charge for something like this?

Character 2: Oof, man, pricing creative work is always tricky. For a full musical with, let's say, twelve to fifteen songs plus underscoring, you're looking at, um, probably somewhere between fifteen and twenty thousand, depending on how complex you want the arrangements.

Character 1: That's way more than I have.

Character 2: Yeah, I figured that might be steep. But hey, what if we, like, started smaller? Maybe we could do a concept album first, just five or six key songs that capture the essence of your story, and then, you know, use that to potentially attract investors?

Character 1: [very meekly] Would you consider doing it for a percentage instead?

Character 2: Hmm, profit participation instead of upfront payment... I mean, that's risky for me obviously, but if you're really serious about getting this produced and not just, uh, playing around with the idea, then maybe we could work something out.

Character 1: [very melancholic] I've been working on this story for three years. It means everything to me.

Character 2: [gasp loudly] Three years? Oh man, okay, that changes things—you're clearly committed to this. Listen, why don't you send me what you've written so far, and I'll, um, take a look and see if I can maybe do a demo song to start?

Character 1: You'd really do that? Just as a test?

Character 2: Sure, I mean, one demo song isn't gonna kill me, and honestly? The whole competitive eating angle is weird enough that I'm, like, genuinely curious about where this could go creatively.

Character 1: Which scene should I send you for the demo?

Character 2: Oh, definitely send me the moment she discovers her talent—that's gotta be, you know, the comedic heart of your show. I'm already imagining this big revelation number with, mmm, increasingly ridiculous food puns, and yeah, I think I could make something pretty fun out of that.
