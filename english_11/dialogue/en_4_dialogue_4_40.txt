=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I've been, um, reading this biography of Berthe Morisot and it's making me realize how much the impressionists were basically rebels.

Character 2: Oh absolutely! I mean, people forget they were literally rejected from the official salon, right? Like, they had to create their own exhibition spaces because the establishment thought their work was, uh, basically unfinished garbage.

Character 1: Exactly! And Morisot had it even harder being a woman in that circle.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah. She couldn't even go to the cafés where they all hung out and talked about art theory. Had to have these, like, formal afternoon teas instead while the guys were drinking absinthe and arguing.

Character 1: Did you know she was actually related to Manet by marriage?

Character 2: Wait, really? I thought— oh right, she married his brother! That's... that's actually kind of fascinating because their styles were so different even though they influenced each other constantly.

Character 1: Her brushwork was, um, arguably more radical than his in some ways.

Character 2: Totally agree. Like, Manet still had these really defined edges sometimes, but Morisot? She was just, uhh, dissolving everything into pure light and color, you know? Super atmospheric.

Character 1: I've been trying to see more impressionist work in person. The reproductions don't capture the texture.

Character 2: Oh man, seeing them in person is completely different. The way the paint literally sits on the canvas, those thick impasto moments where you can see every brushstroke... it's, um, it's almost sculptural.

Character 1: Have you been to the Musée d'Orsay?

Character 2: [joking] Only in my dreams! But seriously, that's like the holy grail, right? Just room after room of impressionists. My friend went last year and she said she literally cried in front of the Renoirs.

Character 1: I'd probably cry at the Caillebotte floor scrapers painting, honestly.

Character 2: Ooh, yes! That perspective is insane. You know what's wild? He was basically self-taught, just this rich guy who collected his friends' paintings and happened to be, like, secretly brilliant at composition.

Character 1: [joking] The ultimate art bro, basically. Rich friend who buys everyone's work.

Character 2: Ha! Exactly. But hey, without patrons like him, half these artists would've starved. Monet was constantly broke until, what, his fifties? Always writing these desperate letters asking for loans.

Character 1: And now his water lilies sell for hundreds of millions.

Character 2: It's kind of ironic, right? They wanted to capture these, um, fleeting everyday moments, nothing fancy or historical, and now their paintings are literally the most expensive objects on earth.

Character 1: Do you think they'd hate what the art market has become?

Character 2: [cough] Sorry, yeah, they'd probably be horrified. I mean, they were trying to democratize art, make it about real life instead of, you know, Greek myths and battle scenes. Now it's all hedge funds and auction houses.
