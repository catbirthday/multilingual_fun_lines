=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You're the UN representative? Didn't expect to see you at the range today.

Character 2: Oh, yeah, I'm actually here for the, um, peacekeeping training certification scores. Let me start with the first set—seventeen, twenty-three, nine. It's mandatory for field assignments now, which is honestly kind of surreal.

Character 1: Wait, you're reading scores while we're actively shooting?

Character 2: Uh-huh, I know it seems weird but apparently this is how they want it done. Next sequence—thirty-one, twelve, forty-five. The idea is that we practice maintaining focus under, you know, actual firing conditions.

Character 1: That's insane. How do you concentrate?

Character 2: [chuckle] Well, I mean, after three years of budget meetings in conflict zones, a little gunfire is almost relaxing. Seven, nineteen, twenty-eight. Though I'll admit my ears are definitely not happy about this arrangement.

Character 1: Which delegation are you with again?

Character 2: The humanitarian affairs division, which makes this whole thing even more, erm, ironic really. Fifty-two, eleven, thirty-six. We're supposed to be the ones pushing for non-violent solutions but here I am reading target scores.

Character 1: [deep pitch] Your accent—is that Scottish?

Character 2: [anxious] Yeah, Edinburgh originally, though I've been bouncing between New York and Geneva for so long that it's kind of, uhh, faded a bit. Twenty-one, forty, fifteen. Sometimes I forget which words I pronounce which way anymore.

Character 1: [pause] Sorry, just reloading. Keep going with the numbers.

Character 2: No worries, take your time. Next set—sixty-three, eight, twenty-nine. You know, it's actually fascinating how different countries approach these certification tests, like the Swiss require twice as many rounds as we do.

Character 1: Really? That seems excessive.

Character 2: [loudly] Oh absolutely, but they're sticklers for precision! Eighteen, thirty-four, four! Their whole philosophy is that if you're going to carry a weapon in peacekeeping operations, you better be, um, exceptionally qualified!

Character 1: [frustrated] Damn, missed that last target completely.

Character 2: [sneeze] Ah, excuse me—the cordite always gets me. Don't worry about it though, everyone misses sometimes. Twenty-six, fourteen, forty-one. I failed this test three times before I finally passed, if that makes you feel any better.

Character 1: Three times? But you seem so calm about it now.

Character 2: Well, I mean, repetition helps with everything eventually, right? Thirty-seven, ten, fifty-five. Plus my field partner kept reminding me that, uh, the numbers don't actually matter as much as staying composed while reading them.

Character 1: Wait, so this is more about multitasking than accuracy?

Character 2: [pause] Exactly, yeah. The whole exercise is basically stress inoculation—can you maintain diplomatic composure while, you know, chaos is happening around you. Last numbers for this round—twenty-two, forty-eight, sixteen.
