It's, uh, honestly mind-blowing that Galileo saw them back in 1610 with his tiny telescope, and here we are seeing the exact same thing, you know? They orbit so fast you can actually watch them change positions night to night."

They're tilted at this perfect angle where you can see the Cassini Division—that's the dark gap between the rings—with a decent backyard telescope.

Mercury goes retrograde like three times a year, and despite what social media says, it doesn't actually affect your electronics or relationships or whatever. Though I guess if it makes people double-check their work and communicate more carefully, maybe that's not the worst thing?"

They predicted eclipses, tracked planetary cycles, navigated oceans... all without knowing what these things actually were, which is, uh, way more impressive than anything I know, really."
