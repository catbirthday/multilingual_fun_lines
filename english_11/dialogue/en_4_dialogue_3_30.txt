=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're a makeup artist? How'd you get into that?

Character 2: [speaking fast] Look, I know what you're thinking—it's not just playing with lipstick and eyeshadow, okay? This is actually a really technical field that requires, like, understanding color theory, skin chemistry, lighting physics, and honestly years of practice to even get decent at.

Character 1: I wasn't judging. Just curious about your journey.

Character 2: Oh. Well, um, I started doing theater makeup in high school, then gradually moved into special effects and editorial work. Most people don't realize we're basically chemists who also have to understand facial anatomy and, you know, psychological aspects of how appearance affects confidence.

Character 1: What's the hardest part of the job?

Character 2: Mmm, probably managing client expectations when they show up with filtered Instagram photos wanting to look exactly like that in real life. I mean, I'm good, but I can't literally restructure bone or, like, turn someone into a completely different person—makeup has limits.

Character 1: [passionately] But you can create amazing transformations, right?

Character 2: [quickly] Absolutely, yes, I can do incredible things with contouring and highlighting, but see, that's different from what people think—it's about enhancing natural features, not erasing them completely. Like, I need something to work with, you know?

Character 1: Do you prefer editorial or bridal work?

Character 2: Editorial, hands down. Bridal is... look, brides are lovely but they're stressed and their mothers have opinions and everyone wants "natural but also glamorous but not too much" which is basically impossible to interpret correctly.

Character 1: [cheerful] What about special effects makeup?

Character 2: Now that's where things get really interesting, though people always assume it's just fake blood and zombies. We're literally sculpting prosthetics, understanding how silicone bonds to skin, and, um, creating believable aging or injuries that hold up under HD cameras.

Character 1: [laugh hysterically] You must have some wild stories!

Character 2: Hah, yeah, like the time an actor was allergic to latex and didn't tell anyone until their face swelled up. Or when I had to completely redo a bride's makeup twenty minutes before the ceremony because she suddenly decided she hated everything.

Character 1: [stuttering] W-what products do you swear by?

Character 2: [sniffle] Ugh, everyone asks this like there's some magic product, but honestly it depends entirely on skin type and what you're trying to achieve. Though if I had to pick, a good color corrector palette can literally save any look—people just don't know how to use them properly.

Character 1: How do you keep up with trends?

Character 2: [friendly] Oh, I mean, trends are fun to watch but they're usually just recycled techniques from previous decades with new names. Like, "cloud skin" is basically just what we called dewy finish in the 90s, but I follow the major artists and, you know, adapt what actually works.

Character 1: [monotone] What's your rate for a full face?

Character 2: Depends on the context—editorial starts at three hundred, bridal is more because of the trial and travel. And before you say that's expensive, um, remember you're paying for years of training, professional kit maintenance, and honestly the ability to not make you look terrible on the most photographed day of your life.
