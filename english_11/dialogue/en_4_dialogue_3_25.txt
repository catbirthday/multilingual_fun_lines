=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you study how people think? That must be fascinating.

Character 2: It's more like studying how people think they think versus how they actually think. We just ran this experiment on decision-making under pressure, and the gap between what participants predicted they'd do and what they actually did was staggering.

Character 1: [sniffle] What kind of decisions are we talking about here?

Character 2: Financial choices, moral dilemmas, even simple pattern recognition. Yesterday's participant swore she was making logical investment choices, but her brain scans showed her amygdala lighting up like a Christmas tree—pure emotional response, zero prefrontal cortex involvement.

Character 1: People don't realize they're being emotional?

Character 2: Never. The brain creates these post-hoc rationalizations instantly. You make a gut decision in milliseconds, then your consciousness scrambles to invent logical reasons why you made that choice. It's backwards from how we think it works.

Character 1: That's kind of terrifying actually.

Character 2: Gets worse. We can predict someone's political choices two seconds before they're consciously aware they've made a decision. The brain activity patterns are clear as day on the scans, but the person still thinks they're deliberating.

Character 1: How is that even possible?

Character 2: Your unconscious processes handle about eleven million bits of information per second. Your conscious mind? Maybe forty bits. You're basically a passenger in your own brain, thinking you're driving.

Character 1: So free will is just an illusion?

Character 2: Not exactly an illusion, more like... delayed commentary. Oh, reminds me of this morning's session—patient with Capgras syndrome, convinced his wife was replaced by an identical imposter. His emotional recognition system is damaged but visual recognition works fine.

Character 1: Wait, he thinks his wife is an imposter?

Character 2: His brain recognizes her face perfectly but doesn't generate the emotional response that says "this is someone I love." So his mind invents an explanation: she must be a duplicate. The rationalization is completely real to him.

Character 1: Can you fix something like that?

Character 2: Sometimes. We're trying this new protocol combining cognitive behavioral therapy with targeted magnetic stimulation. Had a breakthrough last week with a prosopagnosia patient—face blindness—she recognized her daughter for the first time in three years.

Character 1: That must have been emotional.

Character 2: [enunciating every word] They both cried for twenty minutes straight in my office.

Character 1: Do you ever worry that understanding the brain too well takes away from human experience?

Character 2: Actually the opposite. The more I understand about consciousness and cognition, the more miraculous it seems that we function at all. We're these impossibly complex machines running on three pounds of meat, creating love and art and meaning out of electrical impulses.
