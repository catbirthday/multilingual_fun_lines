=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You've been staring at that bridge for twenty minutes.

Character 2: The geometry's fascinating, actually. See how the cables create that perfect parabolic curve? That's pure mathematics holding up 887,000 tons of steel and concrete. Physics made visible.

Character 1: Is that what you tell yourself? That this is about... engineering?

Character 2: No. No, it's about proving something. My whole life, everyone's made my decisions for me—college, career, even which apartment to rent. This jump? This is mine.

Character 1: Your parents don't know you're here.

Character 2: [excited] They think I'm at a conference in Denver! Can you imagine their faces? Their risk-averse daughter, the one who color-codes her calendar, voluntarily throwing herself off a 200-foot bridge with nothing but an elastic cord?

Character 1: [chuckle] You color-code your calendar?

Character 2: By priority level and deadline proximity. Look, we all have our things. The point is, today I'm choosing chaos. Today I'm the person who jumps first and calculates the trajectory later.

Character 1: [sniffle] The wind's picking up.

Character 2: Good. Makes it more authentic. You know what I realized last week? I've never made a single impulsive decision. Not one. Even my rebellions were carefully planned.

Character 1: And this isn't planned? You've got the safety statistics memorized.

Character 2: That's habit, not fear. There's a difference between knowing the numbers and letting them control you. One in 500,000 chance of equipment failure—I've faced worse odds parallel parking downtown.

Character 1: The instructor's waving us over.

Character 2: [very sad] You know what's pathetic? I had to schedule this three weeks out. I literally put "have spontaneous adventure" in my planner. How's that for irony?

Character 1: [loudly] Hey! You're doing it, aren't you? That's what matters!

Character 2: [frustrated] But it shouldn't be this hard! Normal people just... jump. They don't need spreadsheets and pro-con lists and three separate YouTube tutorials on proper bungee form.

Character 1: Normal people are boring.

Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right. Besides, my research says the anticipation is the worst part. Once you're falling, your brain doesn't have time to overthink—it's just pure experience.

Character 1: [laugh loudly] Together then? On three?

Character 2: Together. And for the record? This is the first thing I've done in five years that actually feels like living. One... two... let's become gravity's problem!
