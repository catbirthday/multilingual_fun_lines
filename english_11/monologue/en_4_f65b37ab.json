And the thing is, I actually—I don't know, I thought we were past all this drama. [bitter] Apparently not. [sigh] Four years of friendship and she throws it away over what, exactly? [angry] Because I couldn't make it to one stupid party? [pause] Though honestly, if I'm being real here... maybe this was coming for a while. [slowly] I mean, she's been kind of, um, distant lately. Not returning texts, always too busy. [sad] It hurts, obviously it hurts. [short pause] But there's also this weird... relief? [confused] Like, is that terrible to say? [hesitantly] I've been walking on eggshells around her for months, trying not to, you know, set her off about something. [relieved] And now I don't have to do that anymore. [laugh] Actually, wow, saying that out loud feels kind of freeing? [hopeful] Maybe I can finally, er, focus on the friends who actually want me around. [warmly] Like Sam—she texted me immediately after she heard, just checking in. [cheerful] That's real friendship, right? [confident] Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be okay."
