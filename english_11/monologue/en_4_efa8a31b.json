All those late nights going over the proposal, tweaking the language so it wouldn't scare off the fiscal conservatives. [warm] And now it's real. Like, actually real. \n\n[emotional] You know what gets me? There's this school I visited last year, um, in the south side district. They had one art teacher for eight hundred kids. One. [passionately] And she was doing everything she could with basically nothing—cardboard, donated crayons, whatever she could find. The kids were making these incredible things out of literal trash. \n\n[pause] I keep thinking about this one girl who showed me her sculpture.

[crying while speaking] And now she's going to have actual supplies, actual classes, actual—[sniffle] sorry, I'm just—\n\n[relieved] We changed lives today. Real lives.
