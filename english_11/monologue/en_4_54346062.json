Two hundred and forty restaurants. That's... oh my god, that's millions of meals every month. [pause] Millions of people who won't get sick. [very quietly] Kids who won't end up in the hospital. [speaking fast] Remember that outbreak in Denver last year? Twenty-three people hospitalized, that little girl who almost—[short pause] that can't happen anymore. Not with my system. [passionately] Three years of testing, three years of everyone telling me I was being too cautious, too paranoid about cross-contamination protocols. [bitter] \"It's overkill, Sarah. You're overthinking it, Sarah.\" [laugh loudly] Well who's overthinking now? [warm] My dad would've been so proud. He always said, um... he said the smallest changes save the most lives. [crying while speaking] I wish he could see this. All those nights in the lab, all those failed prototypes, the sensor that literally caught fire that one time—[chuckle] it was worth it. Every rejection letter, every investor who said it was too expensive. [very sincerely] We're going to save people. Real people with families and, uh... and lives and stories. [relieved] I did it. We actually did it."
