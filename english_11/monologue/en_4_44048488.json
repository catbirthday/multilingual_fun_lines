My stupid little mushroom packaging idea that everyone said was, what was it... \"completely delusional.\" [bitter] Yeah, that's what Mark called it at the investor meeting. And now look, it's right here, business section, with my face and everything. [very excited] They're calling it revolutionary! \n\n[sniffle] Sorry, I just... phew, I didn't think this would hit me so hard, you know? All those nights when people would literally laugh— [pause] Actually no, not just laugh, they'd get this look like I was wasting their time. My own dad said I should, um... he said I should \"get a real job before it's too late.\" [very quietly] That one hurt.\n\n[laugh loudly] But here's the thing—I knew. Deep down, I mean, okay maybe not always, there were definitely moments where I thought, hmm, maybe they're right? But mostly I knew this could work. [passionately] Biodegradable packaging that actually grows from agricultural waste! [cheerful] And now Whole Foods wants to meet next week. \n\nMom's already called three times.
