Well, the numbers came in and—[gasp softly] we literally tripled our sales this week. Tripled! [laugh] I mean, the manager actually said people were stopping their cars in the middle of traffic to look at it. Can you imagine? \n\n[excited] And the thing is, I almost didn't go with the mirror installation because, um... I thought maybe it was too much? But then I was like, no, trust your gut, you know? [relieved] Thank God I did. The way the lights bounce off those angled mirrors at night, it's just—mmm, it's exactly what I envisioned. \n\n[warm] My boss pulled me aside today and she was like, \"Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.\" [pause] Which, honestly? After all those late nights eating takeout in the stockroom, rearranging mannequins until my back hurt... [sigh] it feels so good to hear that. \n\n[confidently] I think I'm gonna push for an even bigger budget next quarter. I mean, if this is what I can do with basically nothing, imagine what I could create with actual resources, right?"
