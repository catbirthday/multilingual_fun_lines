Subject: Finding out your stepbrother has been secretly badmouthing you to your parents for years

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] Twenty-three messages. Twenty-three messages between him and my dad about me. [pause] I wasn't even snooping, I just— the iPad was right there and the notification popped up and I saw my name. [bitter] "She's being dramatic again." That's what he wrote. [angry] Dramatic? About what? About asking him to clean up after himself? [sniffle] And Dad just... agreed with him. Mom too, apparently. [very sad] All these years I thought they were just naturally taking his side, but no, he's been— he's been feeding them this narrative about me. [frustrated] Every single argument we had, he'd go running to them with his version. [pause] That dinner last month when Mom said I seemed "difficult lately"— that was him. [upset] The time Dad asked if I was "okay" because I seemed angry all the time— him again. [shaky voice] I feel so stupid. [pause] How do you even— how do you sit across from someone at family dinners, smile at them, and then just... systematically turn your parents against them? [angry] And for what? Because I moved back home after college? Because I exist in the same space? [crying while speaking] I don't even know what to do with this. Do I confront him? Do I tell them I know? [exhausted] God, I'm so tired of feeling like the outsider in my own family.
