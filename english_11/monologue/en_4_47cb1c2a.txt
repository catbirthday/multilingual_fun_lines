Subject: Your polygraph examiner certification is under review after you failed to detect lies that led to a wrongful conviction

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Twenty-three years. Twenty-three years I've been doing this and I... I keep replaying that session in my head. [long pause] The readings were textbook deceptive, but his breathing was so steady, and I just—I thought maybe he was nervous about something else, you know? [regretful] God, I should have pushed harder on those baseline questions. 

[upset] They keep saying "wrongful conviction" like I personally put him in prison. [defensive] But there were witnesses too, there was other evidence, it wasn't just me! [pause] [quietly] Except... except they all recanted, didn't they? [very sad] And now there's this kid—well, he's not a kid anymore—who lost eight years because I missed something.

[anxious] The review board wants all my cases from the past five years. [speeding up] Five years! That's, what, three hundred polygraphs? More? [frustrated] And what if there are others? [whispering] What if I've been getting it wrong this whole time? 

[exhausted] My supervisor keeps saying it's not an exact science, that we're, um... we're just one tool in the process. [bitter] Yeah, tell that to his mother who called me crying. [long pause] [very quietly] I don't know if I can do this anymore. I really don't.
