[pause] This feels different. \n\nThe red flags were all there, you know? The way Mr. Harrison kept interrupting his wife whenever she tried to speak. How he, um... how he kept talking about wanting a child who would be \"grateful.\" [bitter] God, that word. Like little Emma is some kind of, I don't know, some kind of project to make him feel good about himself.\n\n[shaky voice] And I wrote it all up. The home visit notes, the interview concerns, everything. I specifically said—[sigh] I said she needs stability, not performance. She's been through four placements already. She's seven years old and she still, hmm, she still asks if she did something wrong every time someone raises their voice.\n\nBut apparently the Harrisons are, uh... \"prominent community members.\" [sarcastic] They donate to the right causes. They know the right people. And suddenly my supervisor is telling me I'm being \"overly cautious.\" \n\n[very quietly] I saw Emma's face when they told her. She got this look like—like she was already practicing being smaller. [pause] That's what kills me. She already knows how to disappear when she needs to. [regretful] And I couldn't protect her from learning it again."
