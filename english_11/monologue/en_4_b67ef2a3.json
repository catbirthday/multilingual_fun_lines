[short pause] But Derek wasn't even... he wasn't there. I mean, I was the one who—Jesus, I was there for fourteen hours a day with the boom, fixing the lavs when they kept cutting out. [frustrated] Every single take, that was me. And Derek was, what, in Miami that whole week? [bitter] Oh my God, this is actually happening. Like, I thought maybe there was some mistake, but no, there's my name nowhere and his is right there. [upset] You know what the really messed up part is? I actually, um... I sent them all my paperwork, my invoices, everything. Three times. And they kept saying, \"Yeah yeah, we'll fix it,\" but clearly they just—[laugh] wow. [angry] This is such bullshit. I mean, how do you even... how do you take credit for something you literally didn't do? He wasn't there! [very quietly] God, all those nights I stayed late to clean up the room tone, and for what? [pause] I don't even know if I should say something or just... I don't know. This industry, man. [exhausted] This fucking industry."
