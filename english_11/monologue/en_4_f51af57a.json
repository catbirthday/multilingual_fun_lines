[pause] The brake line failed—the mechanic's report literally says \"catastrophic brake failure due to improper maintenance.\" [angry] That's not operator error! [shaky voice] But they don't care, they just... they needed someone to blame, I guess. \n\n[upset] Tommy was standing right where he shouldn't have been, yeah, but I was, um... I was screaming at him to move. [very sad] The whole crew heard me laying on the horn. [sigh] And when the brakes didn't catch, I mean, what was I supposed to do? [anxious] I steered it into the wall instead of... instead of hitting him. [quietly] Destroyed a hundred-thousand-dollar excavator to save his life.\n\n[sarcastic] And my reward? [laugh] Revoked certification. [bitter] Can't even operate a forklift now. [exhausted] My lawyer says we have a case, but that's gonna take, what, two years? [frustrated] Maybe three? [pause] Meanwhile, I'm supposed to just, um... figure out how to pay my mortgage without the only skill I've had since I was nineteen. \n\n[very quietly] Tommy didn't even show up to the hearing. [trailing off] Couldn't look me in the eye after... [angry] God, this is such bullshit!"
