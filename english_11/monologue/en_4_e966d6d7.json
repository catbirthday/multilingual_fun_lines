[sigh] Sarah pulled me aside after the meeting on Monday. [quietly] She was shaking. Actually shaking. And she said she'd been dealing with the same thing for two years. [upset] Two years! Can you imagine keeping that inside for two years? [short pause] Then Marcus sent me this long email Wednesday night. [slowly] I read it three times because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The details he shared were, um... they were worse than anything I experienced. [anxious] And then today, just an hour ago, Rebecca. [crying while speaking] She thanked me. She actually thanked me for being brave when I don't— I don't even feel brave. [sniffle] I was just so tired of staying quiet. [frustrated] You know what kills me? We all thought we were alone in this. [bitter] Every single one of us sitting in those meetings, smiling, pretending everything was fine. [empathetically] But hearing their stories now, knowing what they've been through... [pause] I guess speaking up wasn't just about me after all. [relieved] We're finally not alone anymore. [warmly] And maybe, um, maybe that's what courage really is. Just being the first one to say enough."
