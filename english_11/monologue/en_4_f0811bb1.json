[bitter] One decimal point that I, um, I apparently missed when I was calibrating Mrs. Henderson's meter. [frustrated] And somehow—somehow that turned into a forty-thousand-dollar billing dispute that made the local news. [sarcastic] \"Negligent technician causes utility chaos.\" That's what they called me. [pause] Negligent. [very quietly] God, my kids saw that article. [shaky voice] I keep replaying that day in my head, you know? I was rushing because, uh, because they gave us twice the normal route that week. [angry] But does anyone mention that in the investigation? [short pause] Of course not. [regretful] I should've double-checked. I know I should've. But we're doing the work of three people with these staffing cuts, and I just... [trailing off] mmm, I don't know. [sad] My supervisor wouldn't even look me in the eye when he handed me the termination letter. [hesitantly] Twenty-three years, and I'm basically unhirable now. [very slowly] Who's gonna want a meter tech who lost their certification? [sigh] I guess I'll, er... I'll figure something out. [mumbling] I always do."
