=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] You know what? Today was one of those days where... where everything just worked. Twenty-three years I've been standing in that courtroom, and I've seen, um, I've seen a lot of broken systems. [pause] But today this kid—seventeen, scared out of his mind—he got exactly what he needed. Not jail time, not a slap on the wrist, but actual help. [warm] The judge, she really listened, you know? Like, really listened to his whole story. His mom crying in the gallery, the, uh... the way she grabbed my arm afterward and just kept saying thank you. [emotional] That's not something you forget. [chuckle] I mean, usually I'm just the guy who says "all rise," right? But today I felt like... like I was part of something that actually mattered. The prosecutor even agreed to the treatment program instead of, um, instead of pushing for time. [proudly] That's justice. Not revenge, not politics, just... helping a kid who made one stupid mistake get his life back. [pause] Days like this? [very sincerely] They're why I still put on this uniform every morning.
