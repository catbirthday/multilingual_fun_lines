[pause] And if we were off by even five microns, the valve wouldn't seal properly, and some kid's heart would... [trailing off] \n\n[slowly] I kept checking the measurements over and over. Running the calibration three, four times before each casting. My hands were shaking so bad that first day. [nervous laugh] Here I am, thirty years doing precision work, and suddenly I can't hold a gauge steady because I'm thinking about, um... about the actual kid who needs this.\n\n[warm] But we got it. God, we actually got it perfect. [short pause] The surface finish, the dimensions, everything. \n\n[very quietly] They showed us a video yesterday. [pause] This little girl, she's maybe four years old, running around a playground. [shaky voice] She has one of our valves. The one I cast the components for. She's just... running. Like any other kid. [sniffle]\n\n[passionately] Twenty-three microns. That's what stood between her and a normal childhood. And we, uh... we nailed it. [relieved] Every single measurement. Every casting. Perfect."
