=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [excited] Oh my God, they actually did it! The vote just came through—unanimous support, can you believe that? [pause] I mean, we worked on this for what, eighteen months? All those late nights going over the proposal, tweaking the language so it wouldn't scare off the fiscal conservatives. [warm] And now it's real. Like, actually real. 

[emotional] You know what gets me? There's this school I visited last year, um, in the south side district. They had one art teacher for eight hundred kids. One. [passionately] And she was doing everything she could with basically nothing—cardboard, donated crayons, whatever she could find. The kids were making these incredible things out of literal trash. 

[pause] I keep thinking about this one girl who showed me her sculpture. She told me she wanted to be an artist but didn't think people like her got to do that. [crying while speaking] And now she's going to have actual supplies, actual classes, actual—[sniffle] sorry, I'm just—

[relieved] We changed lives today. Real lives. Not just numbers on a spreadsheet or talking points in a speech. [confident] This is why we do this work, you know? This is why it matters. [pause] God, I need a drink. A celebratory one this time.
