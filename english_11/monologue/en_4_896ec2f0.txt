Subject: Winning the lawsuit against your former employer while watching them destroy evidence of other people's cases

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] God, I won. I actually won. Three years of my life and I finally— [gasp loudly] wait, what are they doing? [confused] Are those... those are case files. [anxious] They're literally shredding them right now, in front of me. [pause] [furious] Those bastards! Those are other people's evidence! [shaky voice] Sarah's harassment case, um, Marcus's wrongful termination, all of it, just... gone. [bitter] They're making sure nobody else can win. [frustrated] I mean, I got mine, right? I got my settlement, my vindication, but... hmm, how many people are they screwing over right now? [very quietly] This is sick. [angry] They're not even trying to hide it anymore. [hesitantly] Should I, uh... should I record this? [nervous] I don't know if I'm allowed to but— [gasp softly] oh my God, that's Jennifer's file. [crying while speaking] She tried so hard to build her case. [pause] [determined] You know what? Screw it. [whispering] I'm filming this. [passionately] They destroyed me for years, but I'm not letting them destroy everyone else. [bitterly] My NDA doesn't cover witnessing new crimes, does it? [confident] Let them try to stop me now.
