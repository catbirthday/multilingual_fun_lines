[bitter] \"Due to unforeseen budget constraints, the funeral director training program will be discontinued effective immediately.\" [pause] That's it. That's all I get. [frustrated] Do they have any idea what I gave up for this? [sigh] I turned down that nursing program. I moved back in with my parents to save money for the certification exams. [very sad] I told everyone this was it, this was my calling, you know? Helping families through their worst days, giving people dignity in death. [shaky voice] And now what? [angry] They couldn't have figured out their budget issues before I invested everything into this? [long pause] [quietly] My mom's going to give me that look. The one that says \"I told you so\" without actually saying it. [regretful] Maybe I should've just stayed in retail. [sarcastic] At least disappointing customers only ruins their day, not their entire future. [exhausted] I don't even know where to, um... where to start over from here. [crying while speaking] I'm thirty-one years old and I'm back at square one. [sniffle] All those anatomy classes, all those late nights studying embalming techniques, the, uh, the internship hours at Morrison's Funeral Home... [trailing off] just gone. [very quietly] What am I supposed to do now?"
