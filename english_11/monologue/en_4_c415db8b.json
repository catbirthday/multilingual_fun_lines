[warmly] Posted the photos and everyone's like \"you're living the dream!\" and yeah, I guess I am. [trailing off] It's just... \n\n[hesitantly] Sarah just bought a house. [pause] Like, an actual house with a garden and everything. [bitter] And Tom's getting married next month—third wedding I'll miss because I'll be in, uh... Peru? Bolivia? [frustrated] I can't even remember anymore.\n\n[very sad] They have dinner parties now. [pause] Regular Tuesday dinner parties where everyone just... shows up. [jealous] Same people, same table, talking about their promotions and their dogs and their, um, their fucking mortgage rates. [laugh] \n\n[anxiously] And I'm sitting in hostels showing strangers my passport stamps like they're... like they're worth something. [very quietly] \"Oh wow, you've been everywhere!\" they say. [pause] Yeah, everywhere except, well... home. [sigh]\n\n[crying while speaking] I keep telling myself this is what I wanted, right? [pause] Freedom, adventure, all that. [very melancholic] But sometimes I just want to know where I'll be next Christmas. [long pause] I want someone to, um... to expect me somewhere. [very quietly] To have a drawer that's just mine."
