Subject: Your art dealer gallery just had three pieces stolen while you were at lunch, and insurance won't cover the full value

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [upset] Three pieces. Three fucking pieces just... gone. [pause] I was at lunch for, what, forty-five minutes? [angry] And the insurance— [laugh bitterly] oh, the insurance is saying they'll cover sixty percent of the assessed value. Sixty! [frustrated] Do they have any idea what the Kellerman piece alone was worth? I mean, we're talking about... ugh, at least two hundred thousand under market value. [shaky voice] That's my entire profit for the quarter.

[anxious] I keep thinking, maybe if I hadn't gone to lunch, you know? If I'd just, um... if I'd stayed and eaten at my desk like usual. [regretful] But Sandra insisted we go to that new place and I thought, hmm, what's the harm? [sigh] God, I'm such an idiot.

[confused] The security footage is basically useless too. They knew exactly where the cameras were, which means... [trailing off] which means someone had been in before, right? [bitter] Someone I probably smiled at, probably offered champagne to at the last opening.

[exhausted] I don't even know how to tell the artists. Marcus specifically chose us because he thought we were, er... more secure than the downtown galleries. [very sad] Three years without a single incident, and now this.
