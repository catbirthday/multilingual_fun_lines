Subject: Your decision to adopt an older shelter pet resulted in the most rewarding relationship of your life

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] Everyone thought I was crazy, you know? [pause] Going to the shelter and specifically asking for the oldest dog they had. [chuckle] But there was Chester—this graying lab mix with, um... with these cloudy eyes that had seen everything. [very melancholic] Seven years old, been returned twice. [sniffle] And I just thought, well, who's gonna want him if not me? [hesitantly] So I filled out the paperwork, and honestly, I was terrified. [anxious] Like, what if we didn't connect? [pause] What if I couldn't, er... couldn't give him what he needed? [shaky voice] But that first night, he just curled up next to me on the couch like he'd always belonged there. [crying while speaking] Three years we had together. [pause] Three perfect years where he taught me more about, hmm, about loyalty and patience than any human ever did. [passionately] Every gray hair, every slow walk, every nap in the sunshine—it was all precious! [very sad] When the vet said it was time, I held him and told him he was the best decision I ever made. [whispering] And I meant it. [extremely happy] Adopting a senior pet isn't giving them a home for their final years—it's them teaching you how to really love. [relieved] Chester saved me, not the other way around.
