Customer [en]: So okay, let me see here... I'm the head trainer for a college basketball team and we're literally on the road constantly

Customer Support [en]: Got it. And I see your account here, member since 2021, status shows Premier Gold. What's happening with the verification?

Customer [en]: Right so every time you guys try to call me back, hmm, what happens is I'm either mid-game taping ankles or we're on a bus to nowhere Kansas and I have zero signal

Customer Support [en]: *exhale* Yeah. That's rough. Your profile shows seventeen missed verification attempts, code VER-4429-NT pending. The system auto-locks after twenty tries. We're at seventeen.

Customer [en]: Seventeen? Oh god okay so that means... wait can I just verify right now while I actually have you? Because next week we have three away games

Customer Support [en]: Wish I could. The verification department, they're separate. Extension 4419. But here's the thing. They only call between 9 AM and 5 PM Eastern. No exceptions.

Customer [en]: Let me think... Tuesday we're in Syracuse, Wednesday Buffalo, Thursday... I just, there's literally no window where I'm not working with twenty-something kids who need ice and tape

Customer Support [en]: *sharp inhale* Okay. Okay. Your case number is CSE-8821-MV47. I'm noting "critical scheduling conflict, athletic department travel." Sometimes that helps bump priority.

Customer [en]: It's just so much right now, the season just started and I'm already behind on ordering supplies because this account thing and I... I can't...

Customer Support [en]: Listen. Real talk? My brother coaches high school. Different level but same chaos. Let me check something. Your order history shows bulk medical supplies, roughly 2,400 dollars monthly average.

Customer [en]: Yeah exactly, tape, ice packs, all of it, and if I can't order... hmm, what if I had someone else call for me?

Customer Support [en]: *exhale* Can't do proxy verification. Security protocol SP-7734. But. But. There's a form. Document exemption DEX-1102. For professionals with, quote, "unavoidable scheduling constraints."

Customer [en]: A form? Okay so that means... how long does that take to process though?

Customer Support [en]: Right. Right. Standard processing, ten business days. But if I mark it urgent, flag code URG-A, drops to forty-eight hours. I'm doing that now.

Customer [en]: Forty-eight hours... let me see, we leave tomorrow morning at five so... yeah okay that could work if it goes through before Saturday

Customer Support [en]: *exhale* Already submitted. Confirmation number CNF-9903-BB22. Also. Personal tip? Call from the hotel landline. Tuesday. Syracuse Marriott probably. Better connection than cell.

Customer [en]: Oh. Oh that's actually... yeah the Marriott downtown, we always stay there, that's smart

Customer Support [en]: Yeah. Yeah. Document exemption should clear by then. But if not? Reference CNF-9903-BB22. Ask for supervisor tier three. They can override.

Customer [en]: I just... thank you, this whole thing has been such a mess and I didn't think anyone would actually help

Customer Support [en]: *sharp inhale* Look. System's broken. We know it. Athletic departments need different protocols. Your exemption's approved. Should've been done ages ago. Email coming now. Address on file ends 4476.
