Character 1 [en]: So the new parking benefits just dropped. Are you seeing this?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, I'm, uh, looking at it right now actually. They're giving us three different tiers to choose from, which is honestly pretty wild—like, we can get reserved spots, valet service, or even those new charging stations if you've got an electric vehicle.

Character 1 [en]: Wait wait wait, valet? That's real?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, totally real. I mean, it's only for the platinum tier, and that's gonna run you about two hundred a month, but jeez, imagine just pulling up and having someone park for you every morning.

Character 1 [en]: [friendly] I'm definitely doing the charging station option.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] But you don't—wait, didn't you just buy that huge truck last month? The one with the, uh, the crazy lift kit and everything? How's that gonna work with an electric charging spot?

Character 1 [en]: Oh no no, I'm trading it in. Going full Tesla.

Character 2 [en]: Yowza, that's quite the pivot. Though honestly, with gas prices being what they are, you'll probably save a fortune—plus the charging is supposedly free if you get the gold tier package.

Character 1 [en]: Free charging AND a guaranteed spot near the entrance?

Character 2 [en]: Well, okay so, it's not exactly near the entrance. The charging stations are in the new garage they're building on the west side, which is, admittedly, like a seven-minute walk from our building.

Character 1 [en]: Seven minutes? In winter?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. They promote all these fancy benefits but then stick us out in the middle of nowhere—meanwhile the executives get heated underground parking literally connected to the lobby.

Character 1 [en]: Classic move. What about the regular reserved spots?

Character 2 [en]: Those are actually pretty decent, um, if you can snag one. They're limiting it to fifty spots in the main garage, first-come-first-served starting Monday at nine AM—it's gonna be like trying to get concert tickets.

Character 1 [en]: Ugh, another online lottery system?

Character 2 [en]: Erhm, worse actually. You have to physically go to HR with your employee badge and, like, literally sign up on a clipboard—they said the online system crashed last time so they're going old school.

Character 1 [en]: A clipboard? In 2024?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering loudly] I heard from Janet that if you slip her a Starbucks card, she'll, you know, accidentally put your name higher on the list. Not saying you should, but I mean, parking is parking.

Character 1 [en]: That's so corrupt. I love it.

Character 2 [en]: Oh gosh, right? Look, I'm bringing her a whole gift basket—I've been parking three blocks away for two years now, and honestly, I'd probably sell my soul for a guaranteed spot at this point.
