Character 1 [en]: Hey, I know this might sound unexpected, but would you want to grab coffee after your shift?

Character 2 [en]: Oh! Umm, that's... wow, that's really nice of you to ask. I don't usually, uh, get invitations like this—most people don't really see past the uniform, you know? I mean, I'd actually really like that.

Character 1 [en]: Great! There's this amazing place downtown that stays open late.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Yeah, I think I know the one you're talking about! They have those, mmm, incredible pastries, right? The owner's actually an old friend from high school—we still catch up sometimes when I'm, like, not completely exhausted from work.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Oh sure, because working here must be such a relaxing vacation.

Character 2 [en]: Ha! Yeah, it's definitely, erm, not what most people imagine. But honestly, there are moments that make it worthwhile—like when you actually connect with someone, help them turn things around, you know? Though I guess that probably sounds, uhh, overly optimistic.

Character 1 [en]: [animated] No, no, I totally get that! You seem like someone who genuinely cares.

Character 2 [en]: Oh gosh, thank you for saying that. It's, well, it's harder some days than others to maintain that caring perspective, but I try to remember everyone here is, like, someone's family, someone's friend—they're all human beings going through probably the worst time of their lives.

Character 1 [en]: That's exactly why I wanted to talk to you outside of here.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, I appreciate that more than you know. Most of my friendships have kind of, uh, drifted away since I started this job—people get uncomfortable when they find out what I do, or they assume I'm, I don't know, hardened or something.

Character 1 [en]: People can be pretty judgmental. You deserve to have a normal social life.

Character 2 [en]: You're really kind to say that. Honestly, it gets, hmm, pretty isolating sometimes, especially on the tough days when you just want to talk to someone who doesn't, like, immediately change the subject when you mention work, even though I totally understand why they do.

Character 1 [en]: Well, I promise I won't change the subject. Unless you want me to.

Character 2 [en]: That means a lot, seriously. Oh, and just so you know, I can probably make it around, erm, seven-thirty? My shift ends at seven but I'll need to, you know, decompress for a minute and change out of all this gear.

Character 1 [en]: Seven-thirty works perfectly. Should we exchange numbers?

Character 2 [en]: [loudly] Oh yes, definitely! Sorry, didn't mean to be so loud—I'm just, uhh, genuinely excited about this! It's been forever since I've had plans that weren't just going home to Netflix and, like, wondering if I'm making any difference at all in this place.

Character 1 [en]: You are making a difference. I can tell.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, thank you. You know what? This conversation has already, mmm, brightened my whole week. I'm looking forward to actually talking about, I don't know, normal things—movies, books, whatever—and not having everything circle back to corrections and rehabilitation statistics.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] I'm sorry it's taken me this long to ask.

Character 2 [en]: Oh no, don't be sorry at all! The fact that you asked now is, well, it's perfect timing actually. I've been needing this—needing someone to see me as just, you know, a person who happens to work here, not as the job itself.
