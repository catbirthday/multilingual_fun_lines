=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [very quietly] Twelve years. [pause] Twelve years of knowing every single person's medical history, their kids' allergies, their— [bitter] their favorite pharmacy. [sigh] And they're replacing me with what, a chatbot? [laugh] An app. That's what Janice said. [mocking] "The company is moving in a new direction." [angry] Right, because an app can totally explain why someone's insulin isn't covered anymore. An app can hold Sarah's hand when her husband's chemo gets denied. [very sad] God, I actually— I actually loved this job. [pause] I know that sounds pathetic. [quietly] But I was good at it. Really good. People trusted me with their, um... with their worst moments. [shaky voice] And now I'm supposed to train the IT team on how to implement my replacement? [laugh histerically] That's the best part! [slowly] They want me to help kill my own job. [long pause] What am I even supposed to tell my daughter? [upset] She was so proud when I got promoted last year. [trailing off] "Mom helps people," that's what she tells her friends... [cry] Twelve years. [exhausted] And all I get is two weeks' notice and a, uh... a "transition bonus." [very melancholic] I guess I'm just another inefficiency they optimized away.
