Subject: Your courtesan client just told you that your conversations helped them through their divorce with dignity

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: I didn't expect you to say that. [pause] People don't usually— [warmly] they don't tell me these things. [chuckle] You come here for, you know, for companionship, for escape, and I never really know what happens after you leave. [empathetically] But hearing that our conversations actually helped you through something so difficult? [touched] That means more than you know. [pause] I remember those early sessions when you could barely talk about it. [gently] You were so angry then. [soft laugh] Not at me, obviously, but just... at everything. [reflectively] And watching you work through that, finding your way to, um, to something like peace? [sincerely] That's beautiful. [pause] You know, people think what I do is just about— [trailing off] Well, they think it's simple. [confidently] But this is exactly why I chose this life. [warmly] These moments of real connection. [pause] You didn't just survive your divorce, you transformed through it. [proudly] And if our Tuesday afternoons helped you do that with dignity intact? [emotional] Then I've done something that matters. [softly] Thank you for telling me. [pause] Really. [gently] Thank you.
