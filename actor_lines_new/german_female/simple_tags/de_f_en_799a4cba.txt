=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] So, um, they sent me to investigate the acid burn incident from last week, and I... I didn't know you still worked at Dad's shop. [pause] I mean, I guess it's your shop now.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Yeah, well, someone had to keep it running after he died. [sighs] Not that you'd know anything about that, considering you didn't even show up for the funeral.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Look, I know how that must have seemed, but there were, uh, there were reasons I couldn't— [clears throat] We should probably focus on the inspection, actually. Can you show me where the accident happened?

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Right, of course, let's just pretend we're strangers. [sarcastically] The workbench is over here, inspector. The ventilation hood malfunctioned while I was working with the etching solution.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] You're still making Mom's wedding ring design, I see. The one with the, um, the intertwined vines? [pause] She always loved that pattern, said it reminded her of how families grow together.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Don't.

Character 1 [en]: The safety protocols here are actually, err, they're better than most shops I inspect, which doesn't surprise me because you were always the careful one. [quietly] Unlike me, I guess.

Character 2 [en]: [melancholic] Careful.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] I need to document the ventilation system failure, but honestly, it looks like you did everything right. Sometimes equipment just fails, and, uh, sometimes people fail each other too, I suppose.

Character 2 [en]: [warm] You know, after the accident, lying there with acid burning through my glove, all I could think about was that stupid fight we had over Dad's tools. [sighs] Five years of silence over a box of pliers and files.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] It wasn't really about the tools though, was it? It was about me leaving, choosing a government job over the family business, and, um, basically telling Dad his life's work wasn't enough for me. [voice breaking] I was so wrong, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: Mom calls sometimes, you know. She doesn't understand why her kids can't even be in the same room anymore. [very quietly] I tell her you're busy, but we both know that's not really it.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Look, I can, uh, I can recommend another inspector if you want. Someone who doesn't have all this... this history that makes everything hurt just by being here.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] No, wait. [pause] Maybe this is actually what we needed, you know? Some official reason to be in the same space, to actually talk instead of just, I don't know, existing in parallel lives.

Character 1 [en]: [hopefully] The inspection report won't be done until tomorrow. I mean, there's paperwork and, um, follow-up measurements I need to take. Maybe we could grab coffee after I finish today? Talk about something other than safety violations?

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] Yeah, okay.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] I've been carrying Dad's old loupe in my inspection kit for five years. [laughs softly] My coworkers think I'm crazy, using a jeweler's tool to check industrial equipment, but it helps me see the small things that matter.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] He would've liked that, honestly. Using the right tool for the job, even if it's not the, uh, the conventional choice. [sighs] Just like he would've understood why you needed to leave, even if it broke his heart.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] I should've come back sooner, should've been here when you needed help with the business transition or, hell, just been here as your sister, not some stranger with a clipboard.

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] Well, you're here now. [quietly] And maybe that's enough to start with, you know? Maybe we can, um, maybe we can figure out how to be family again, one safety inspection at a time.
