Scenario: A prosecutor discovers their sibling has been helping their mutual parent hide assets from the IRS, forcing them to confront the tax advisor who facilitated it.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stern] I found the paperwork, Marcus. [pause] The shell companies, the offshore accounts, everything you set up for Dad. [very quietly] Did you really think I wouldn't find out about this?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Your father came to me asking for legitimate tax planning strategies, nothing more. [clearing throat] Every structure I created falls within the bounds of current tax law, even if they're aggressive.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Aggressive? [laughs] That's what you're calling three million dollars routed through the Caymans? [firmly] We both know what this looks like to the IRS.

Character 2 [en]: [mumbling] It's complicated.

Character 1 [en]: [controlling] No, it's not complicated at all. [speeding up] You helped him hide assets from federal tax authorities, and now I'm in an impossible position. [pause] My own brother.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Look, Sarah, I never wanted you involved in this. [sighs] Dad specifically asked me not to tell you because he knew how you'd react. [hesitantly] He's terrified of losing everything he built.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Everything he built on the backs of underpaid workers while dodging his civic responsibilities? [coldly] That's the legacy you're helping him protect?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] He's our father, Sarah. [quietly] Remember when Mom was sick and he mortgaged everything to pay for her treatment? [pause] He's just trying to protect what little he has left.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Don't you dare bring Mom into this. [furious] She would have been horrified to know what you two have been doing behind my back.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] You're right, she would have been. [exhales] But she's not here, and Dad's drowning in medical debt from her final years. [very quietly] Sometimes the law and what's right aren't the same thing.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] The audit notice arrives tomorrow, Marcus. [quickly] They're going to tear through everything, and when they find your name on those documents, they'll come for your license.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] They won't find anything illegal because there isn't anything illegal. [coughs] Unethical to you, maybe, but every loophole I used exists for a reason.

Character 1 [en]: [mocking] Loopholes. [sarcastically] Is that what you tell yourself at night? [stern] The structuring alone constitutes felony tax evasion, and you know it.

Character 2 [en]: [nervous] If you report this, you destroy all three of us. [gasps softly] Your career, my practice, Dad's remaining years. [desperately] There has to be another way.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] I've already drafted the disclosure documents. [sighs] But I haven't filed them yet because despite everything, you're still my brother.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Thank God. [quickly] We can unwind the structures, amend the returns, pay the back taxes with penalties. [hopefully] No one has to know how deep this went.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] You have forty-eight hours to convince Dad to come clean voluntarily. [firmly] After that, I file the papers and recuse myself from any resulting investigation.

Character 2 [en]: [grateful] That's more than fair. [chuckles] Remember when we were kids and you always gave me one chance to confess before telling Mom? [warmly] Some things never change.

Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] Some things should change, Marcus. [trailing off] We're not kids anymore, and the stakes are so much higher than a broken window or stolen cookies.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] I'll make this right, Sarah, I promise. [pause] Dad will listen to me, and we'll fix this before it destroys everything we have left as a family. [quietly] Everything.
