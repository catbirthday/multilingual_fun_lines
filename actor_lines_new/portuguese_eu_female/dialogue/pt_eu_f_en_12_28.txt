Character 1 [en]: Did you ever figure out that 401k thing from senior year?

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, the 401k presentation! Yeah, I, uh, I actually work in finance now, which is honestly kind of ironic considering how confused I was back then. Still remember sleeping through most of that workshop.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, you're in finance? You failed econ twice.

Character 2 [en]: I know, right? Failed it twice and now I'm literally explaining retirement portfolios to people every day. Life's, mmm, life's weird like that sometimes—you end up exactly where you swore you'd never be.

Character 1 [en]: So should I actually have one? A 401k?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, yeah, especially if your company matches. That's basically free money you're leaving on the table, and compound interest is, like, genuinely magical when you give it enough time to work.

Character 1 [en]: [sleepily] I keep meaning to sign up. The paperwork is exhausting.

Character 2 [en]: Ugh, the paperwork is the worst part, I totally get that. But honestly, most places now have these online portals where you can just, you know, click through everything in maybe fifteen minutes tops.

Character 1 [en]: [very slowly] Twenty years until reunion. Think we'll all be rich by then?

Character 2 [en]: Rich? Hmm, probably not rich rich, but if you start now, you'd be, uh, surprised how much builds up. Even just a hundred bucks a month becomes something pretty substantial over two decades.

Character 1 [en]: Remember when Jake said he'd retire at thirty?

Character 2 [en]: Oh my god, Jake! Yeah, he was all about that FIRE movement before it was even a thing. Last I heard though, he's still grinding at some startup, so, err, that plan didn't exactly pan out.

Character 1 [en]: Everyone had such big plans back then.

Character 2 [en]: We really did, didn't we? I mean, I was convinced I'd be running my own gallery by now, and instead I'm explaining Roth conversions and, like, diversification strategies to confused thirty-somethings.

Character 1 [en]: Is it too late to start? Be honest.

Character 2 [en]: Too late? No no, absolutely not. Sure, starting at twenty-two would've been ideal, but starting now is, mmm, infinitely better than starting at forty or never starting at all, you know?

Character 1 [en]: What percentage should I put in?

Character 2 [en]: [sigh] Well, the standard advice is at least enough to get the full company match, but ideally? Fifteen percent if you can swing it, though honestly most people start lower and work their way up.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] I've wasted so much time already.

Character 2 [en]: Hey, don't think of it as wasted—you've been living your life, right? And besides, starting now means you'll have something solid by reunion time, which is more than a lot of our classmates will manage.
