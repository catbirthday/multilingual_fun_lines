Character 1 [en]: [very loudly] I just lost three thousand dollars on the election markets! Can you believe this?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Oh god, another one. Look, I've been getting calls like this all day and, honestly, the markets were showing clear signals that— wait, sorry, that's not helpful. Three thousand, that's, um, that's rough. Which platform were you using?

Character 1 [en]: Polymarket. Everyone said it was a sure thing.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, yeah, Polymarket. Okay so, here's the thing about prediction markets—they're not actually about what's gonna happen, they're about what people *think* is gonna happen, which is, like, a totally different animal. You feeling okay about the loss or is it, uh, is it hitting hard?

Character 1 [en]: [gasp softly] Wait, you're not going to lecture me?

Character 2 [en]: Lecture you? No, no, I mean, what good would that do now? You're already feeling it, right? Look, I've, um, I've been there myself—not with three grand, but enough to sting. The real question is what you want to do next, like, are you trying to understand what went wrong or just need to vent?

Character 1 [en]: I guess I want to understand. Everyone seemed so confident.

Character 2 [en]: Right, yeah, that confidence thing is actually super interesting. So when everyone's confident about the same outcome, the odds get, uh, they get really skewed, and the potential payout shrinks while the risk stays basically the same or even increases. Were you looking at the order books at all, or mostly just the headline percentages?

Character 1 [en]: Just the percentages. 92% chance seemed unbeatable.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, okay, so that 92% is where things get tricky. It means if you bet a hundred times on similar 92% events, you'd expect to lose about eight times, which doesn't sound like much until, well, until you're one of those eight. But also, prediction markets can be, like, weirdly sticky near extremes.

Character 1 [en]: What do you mean by sticky?

Character 2 [en]: Oh right, so, basically when a market gets up to like 90-plus percent, it takes a lot of money to move it even a little bit, which means new information doesn't always get priced in quickly. Like, you could have major news break and the market barely budges because, um, because moving from 92 to 85 percent requires massive volume.

Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] I should have known better. I teach statistics for a living.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, a stats professor? Okay, that actually makes this, uh, weirdly more understandable. You know how, like, doctors make the worst patients? Same thing here—when you know the theory really well, sometimes you overthink the model and underthink the, I mean, the messy human behavioral stuff that drives these markets.

Character 1 [en]: [groan] Don't remind me. My students would have a field day with this.

Character 2 [en]: Ha, yeah, though honestly? This could be, like, an incredible teaching moment. I mean, nothing drives home the difference between probability and certainty quite like, uh, like having skin in the game. Plus, behavioral finance is basically just psychology wearing a suit, you know?

Character 1 [en]: You're being surprisingly understanding about this.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, what's the alternative—make you feel worse? Look, these markets are designed to be, um, they're designed to feel more certain than they are. The whole interface, the way they present data, it's all nudging you toward overconfidence. You're definitely not the first smart person to get caught out.

Character 1 [en]: Should I try to win it back?

Character 2 [en]: Oof, okay, that's— that's literally the worst thing you could do right now. Like, chasing losses is how three thousand turns into ten thousand. If you really want to keep playing these markets, maybe, I don't know, set aside a hundred bucks next month and treat it as, um, as tuition for learning the quirks? But definitely not today, not while you're still processing this one.
