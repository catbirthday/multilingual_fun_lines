Character 1 [en]: So you're calling about the Coursera subscription?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, um, it's about your outstanding balance with multiple e-learning platforms. I'm seeing, let me just... yeah, three different accounts here that are seriously past due.

Character 1 [en]: Three? I only remember signing up for one course.

Character 2 [en]: [child-like] Oh gosh, yeah, that happens a lot actually. People forget about the auto-renewals and, uh, suddenly you've got LinkedIn Learning, MasterClass, and Skillshare all charging monthly fees that've been accumulating for months now.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, I canceled MasterClass ages ago.

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, according to what I'm seeing here, you canceled through the app but not, like, through their billing system? It's honestly kind of a nightmare how they set it up.

Character 1 [en]: That can't be legal.

Character 2 [en]: Ehhh, technically it's all in the terms of service that, I mean, nobody actually reads those things, right? But legally they can keep charging until you follow their specific cancellation process.

Character 1 [en]: How much are we talking about total?

Character 2 [en]: Okay so, let me pull this up... we're looking at, jeez, $847.32 total. That's with the late fees and, um, the collection agency's percentage added on top.

Character 1 [en]: Eight hundred dollars for online courses I never even finished?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I know it sounds insane. Look, between you and me, these e-learning companies are really aggressive with their billing. They bank on people forgetting about subscriptions.

Character 1 [en]: Can we work out some kind of payment plan?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely, yeah. We can do, uh, monthly installments. Most people go with six months but honestly, we can stretch it to twelve if that helps you out more.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] I-I don't have steady income right now. I'm between jobs.

Character 2 [en]: Ah man, that's rough. Okay, so here's what I can do—if you can make even a small payment today, like literally just $50, I can mark the account as, you know, cooperating and stop the daily interest from accumulating.

Character 1 [en]: Daily interest? On online course subscriptions?

Character 2 [en]: Right? It's ridiculous but that's apparently how it works once it goes to collections. The original companies sell the debt to us and then we're supposed to, errm, maximize recovery or whatever.

Character 1 [en]: What happens if I just don't pay?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? Your credit takes a hit for seven years, and they might try wage garnishment eventually. But look, we can probably settle for like 60% if you pay it all today.
