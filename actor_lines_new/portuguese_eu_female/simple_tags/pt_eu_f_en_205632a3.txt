Scenario: A demigod returns to their childhood home after centuries away, only to find the old wooden fence that protected their mortal mother's garden still standing—and somehow conscious.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I didn't expect you to still be here, after all these centuries. [pause] Everything else is gone—the house, the garden, even the old oak tree Mom used to sit under.

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] You remember me then, young god? I wasn't sure if, um, if beings like you noticed things like old fences when there were worlds to conquer and, well, immortal matters to attend to.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Immortal matters. [sighs] That's what Father called them too, when he pulled me away from this place. I was only sixteen in mortal years, barely understanding what I was, and suddenly I couldn't come back.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Your mother used to lean against me every sunset, waiting for you. She'd tell me stories about you—how you could make flowers bloom with a touch, how you'd accidentally summon thunderstorms when you cried.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] She talked to you? I mean, actually spoke to a fence about me? [laughs sadly] That sounds like her, finding comfort wherever she could after Dad took me to Olympus.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] More than talked, really. She, uh, she enchanted me somehow—gave me awareness, memories, maybe even something like a soul. Said she needed someone to remember everything when she was gone.

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] She gave you consciousness?

Character 2 [en]: [very melancholic] The last gift of a heartbroken hedge witch to her garden's guardian. Though I'm not sure if it was a gift or a curse, watching everything I was meant to protect slowly fade while I remained.

Character 1 [en]: How long did she wait for me? Father said—he told me she understood, that she moved on with her mortal life, found happiness again after I left.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] She waited forty-three years, seven months, and twelve days. [long pause] Never stopped setting an extra place at dinner, never stopped tending the rosebush you planted together, never stopped believing you'd find a way back.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] I tried so many times to return, but the laws of Olympus—once you ascend, mortal realms become like dreams you can't quite touch. By the time I found a loophole, she was already gone.

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] I held her up when her legs grew weak, felt her tears when the seasons changed and you didn't come home. She'd trace your initials that you carved into my third post—they're still there, if you look.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Stop, please. Every word you say makes it worse, knowing I chose divinity over her, that I believed Father's lies about glory being worth more than mortal love.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] She never blamed you, not once. She understood you were caught between two worlds, two fathers, two destinies. What she feared most was that you'd blame yourself, carry guilt that wasn't yours to bear.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] But it is mine to bear. I had the power of gods and couldn't even send her a message, couldn't let her know I was thinking of her every single day.

Character 2 [en]: [fading] My boards are rotting, young god, and my consciousness is finally starting to slip. But before I go, she wanted me to tell you something—she said you'd come back eventually. [slower] She said to tell you that love doesn't count time the way gods or mortals do.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Wait, you're fading now? [quickly] After holding on for centuries, you're leaving just when I finally made it home? There must be something I can do, some divine power that could restore you!

Character 2 [en]: [peacefully] No, child. This is mercy.

Character 1 [en]: [pleading] Let me fix you, strengthen your wood, pour my immortal essence into your boards—anything! You're the last piece of her, the last thing that remembers our life here before everything changed.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] She's not in my wood, young god, she's in your memories. I was just keeping them safe until you were ready to carry them yourself. [trailing off] Now plant something new here... let it grow without the weight of what was...
