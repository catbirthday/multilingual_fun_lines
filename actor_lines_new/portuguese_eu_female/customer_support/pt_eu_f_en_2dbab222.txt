=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I'm calling regarding case number 45921. I was promised a full refund last Tuesday, but nothing has been processed.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me pull up case number CS-45921-QT and review the notes from your previous interaction with our team.

Customer [en]: The representative specifically said it would be completed within 48 hours. It's been a full week now.

Customer Support [en]: I sincerely apologize for this oversight. I can see agent Melissa Rodriguez did authorize the refund on November 5th, but it appears the request wasn't forwarded to our processing department.

Customer [en]: This is exactly what I need resolved today. When can I expect to see the refund?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely understood. I'm escalating this immediately with priority code PRI-8847-URGENT, and I'll personally ensure the refund of $487.92 is processed within the next four hours.

Customer [en]: I appreciate that. Will I receive confirmation when it's actually been processed this time?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly.

Customer [en]: And how long after processing until the funds appear in my account?

Customer Support [en]: Once I complete the processing today, which will be by 3:00 PM Eastern, the funds will appear in your account within 2-3 business days depending on your bank's policies.

Customer [en]: I also want to ensure there's proper documentation of this delay and the inconvenience it's caused.

Customer Support [en]: Of course. I'm adding detailed notes to your account under reference number DOC-112024-7739, including the service failure and my personal guarantee of resolution today.

Customer [en]: Good. Can you also explain how this type of error happens in your system?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. The issue occurred when the refund authorization form RF-2024-11-05-MR wasn't properly routed through our workflow system, likely due to a technical error during submission.

Customer [en]: What steps are being taken to prevent this from happening to other customers?

Customer Support [en]: I'm flagging this incident for our quality assurance team under report QA-8892-PROCESS, and we're implementing additional verification checkpoints to catch any pending authorizations over 72 hours old.

Customer [en]: I need the email confirmation sent to my address on file. Is that still the Gmail account?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, I have your email as michael.harrison@gmail.com, and you'll receive two confirmations: one immediately showing case PRI-8847-URGENT is being processed, and another when the refund completes.

Customer [en]: Perfect. I expect this to be handled correctly this time. Thank you for your assistance.

Customer Support [en]: You have my personal assurance this will be resolved today. I'll monitor case PRI-8847-URGENT myself, and if you have any concerns, please reference my agent ID SR-4429 when calling back.
