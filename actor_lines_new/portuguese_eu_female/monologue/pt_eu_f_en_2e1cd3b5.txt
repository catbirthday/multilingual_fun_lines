=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] You know what's crazy? I can still hear it—that exact moment we captured. The one that made it into the final cut. [pause] We were, um, we were on day forty-seven, and everyone was exhausted, right? The lead actor had been doing this scene for... God, must've been twelve takes. And I'm sitting there with my headphones, just listening, and suddenly—[excited] there it was! This perfect breath before the line. Not just the words, but this tiny, ehhh, this vulnerable inhale that said everything. 

[slowly] Nobody else noticed it. The director was focused on the blocking, the DP was worried about a shadow, but I heard it. [passionate] That's what people don't understand about sound—it's not just dialogue! It's the space between words, the way fabric moves when someone shifts their weight, the... the emotional texture of silence. 

[laugh] And now it's an Oscar winner. [quietly] Sometimes I replay that scene, and I think, hmm, what if I'd missed it? What if my levels were off or the boom was positioned wrong? [relieved] But we got it. Every layer. The performance, the atmosphere, that perfect accidental magic. [warm] Twenty-three years doing this job, and that moment—[trailing off] that's why I do it.
