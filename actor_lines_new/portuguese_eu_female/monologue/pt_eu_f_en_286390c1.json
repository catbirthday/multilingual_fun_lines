He's explaining it to the class and he's... [shaky voice] Holy shit, he's actually getting it right. [laugh] Six months of me staying after school with him, six months of \"I can't do this, Miss Chen, I'm too stupid,\" and now he's up there teaching the other kids how to factor polynomials. Look at his face, he's, um... he's actually proud of himself. [very quietly] When he turned around just now and saw me nodding, that little smile—God, that's what I became a teacher for. [sniffle] All those nights I went home thinking maybe I wasn't reaching him, maybe I was pushing too hard, and... [warm] Jeez, I think I might actually cry. He just told Sarah, \"No, look, it's actually pretty easy once you get it.\" Marcus said math was easy. [crying while speaking] I need to, uh, I need to text his mom after class. She's been so worried about him, and now... now he believes he can do this."
