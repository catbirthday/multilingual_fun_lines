=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [bitter] She finally said it. Depois de todos estes anos, ela disse mesmo que eu era... que eu era formidable. [pause] A palavra exata dela. "Formidable." [chuckle] Meu Deus, andei à espera disto há o quê, 7 anos? 8? E agora é só... [sigh] sei lá, parece tão vazio, sabes? Tipo, hum, todas aquelas noites que fiquei até tarde só para superar as propostas dela, todos aqueles fins de semana que passei, é... obcecada com ultrapassar os números dela. [regretful] I missed my nephew's birthdays. Vários aniversários. Para quê? Para finalmente conseguir que ela me respeitasse? [slowly] And the thing is, I think I always knew, sabes? Que estávamos só a... mm, destruir-nos. As duas. [sad] She looks exhausted too. Somos as duas umas versões esgotadas do que éramos. [pause] I remember when I actually liked this job. Antes de se tornar sobre... sobre ela. Sobre vencê-la. [very quietly] What else could I have done with those years? Quem é que eu podia ter sido se não estivesse tão focada em ser a rival dela? [sigh] "Formidable." Pois. É isso que eu sou agora. [very melancholic] A formidable person who forgot how to be anything else.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [bitter] She finally said it. After all these years, she actually said I was... that I was formidable. [pause] Her exact word. "Formidable." [chuckle] God, I've been waiting to hear that for, what, seven years? Eight? And now it's just... [sigh] I don't know, it feels so hollow somehow. Like, um, all those nights I stayed late just to outdo her proposals, all those weekends I spent, er... obsessing over beating her numbers. [regretful] I missed my nephew's birthdays. Multiple birthdays. For what? To finally get her to respect me? [slowly] And the thing is, I think I always knew, you know? That we were just... mm, destroying ourselves. Both of us. [sad] She looks exhausted too. We're both just these, I don't know, depleted versions of who we used to be. [pause] I remember when I actually liked this job. Before it became about... about her. About beating her. [very quietly] What else could I have done with those years? Who else could I have been if I wasn't so focused on being her rival? [sigh] "Formidable." Yeah. That's what I am now. [very melancholic] A formidable person who forgot how to be anything else.
