The actual core develops this, er, really complex density gradient during silicon burning—you've got an inner homologous core at about 10 to the 10 g/cc surrounded by these infalling shells that are basically in free-fall once photodisintegration starts eating away at the iron peak nuclei."

The URCA processes alone—beta decay and electron capture cycles—they're dumping energy faster than, uh, than gravity can replenish it until you hit neutrino trapping around 10 to the 12 g/cc."

The millisecond pulsars like PSR J1748-2446ad spinning at 716 Hz kind of push against those softer equations of state though."

The tidal deformability parameter Lambda was, uh, less than 800, suggesting relatively stiff nuclear matter—probably ruling out hyperons or kaon condensates."

The, er, relativistic mean field models with scalar-vector coupling constants tuned to finite nuclei data—they're actually handling both constraints pretty well now, giving maximum masses around 2.2 to 2.3 solar masses."

Modified URCA and neutrino bremsstrahlung processes dominate instead, giving you those, uh, surface temperatures around 10 to the 6 Kelvin after a million years."

The fields—10 to the 15 Gauss—they're probably maintained by, er, some combination of turbulent dynamo action and maybe fossil fields from the progenitor, but the decay timescales don't match observations and we can't explain the sudden outbursts properly."

And honestly, once you factor in the magnetosphere twist dynamics and potential core-crust coupling through Alfven oscillations, the whole evolution becomes basically intractable analytically."
