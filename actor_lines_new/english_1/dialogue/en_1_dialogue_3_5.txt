=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [speeding up] I finally went through Dad's workshop today—I know you said it might help.

Character 2: That's such a big step. I remember how hard it was just to open that door the first few months. How are you holding up after being in there?

Character 1: You were right about taking my time with it. Found his half-finished birdhouse.

Character 2: Those birdhouses meant everything to him. He showed me his collection once, told me about each bird species he was hoping to attract. The unfinished one must hit differently.

Character 1: Do you think finishing it would honor him? I want to do something meaningful.

Character 2: That would be beautiful. Working on something he started connects you to him in a way that just preserving things can't. Plus you'd be creating something new from grief.

Character 1: [shy] Would you mind teaching me the tools? I don't want to mess up what he started.

Character 2: I'd be honored to help. My grandfather taught me woodworking years ago, and honestly, sharing those skills feels like passing on something sacred. We could start this weekend if you're ready.

Character 1: Thank you for being so patient with all this. His handwriting on the labels makes me smile now.

Character 2: His handwriting was absolutely terrible. But those crooked labels are pure him—every workshop needs that personal chaos that tells you exactly whose space it was.

Character 1: I know this must bring up memories of your mom too. Are you okay talking about this?

Character 2: [gasp softly] You remembered. Yeah, it does bring things back, but helping you actually helps me too. Grief shared somehow gets a little lighter.

Character 1: The sawdust smell made me think of you saying scents are memory triggers.

Character 2: They really are the strongest memory pulls we have. That sawdust is probably mixed with years of his aftershave and coffee. It's him in molecular form.

Character 1: His coffee mug's still there. Mom needs time before we move anything.

Character 2: Your mom's processing this her own way. Some people need those anchors to stay exactly where they were. The mug isn't hurting anyone by staying put.

Character 1: She mentioned selling his power tools eventually, but I think she's not really ready.

Character 2: [confidently] Families always struggle with the practical stuff. My suggestion? Keep the tools that tell stories. The ones with wear marks from his hands, the ones he saved up for, the ones he was proud of.

Character 1: You're right. Which one do you think meant the most to him?

Character 2: Probably his first good saw or the tool he splurged on against all logic. Those are the ones that represent dreams and commitment, not just function. Check for the most worn handles.
