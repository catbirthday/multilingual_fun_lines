=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I can't... I can't get this stupid couch through the doorway no matter what angle I try, and my back is absolutely killing me right now.

Character 2: [chuckle] You're trying to force it straight through when you need to tilt it diagonally. Here, let me grab the other end and we'll pivot it forty-five degrees counterclockwise first.

Character 1: Wait wait, let me just... catch my breath for a second here... This thing weighs like three hundred pounds or something ridiculous.

Character 2: [empathetically] Moving furniture alone is basically asking for a herniated disc. I threw out my back last year trying to move my grandmother's armoire by myself, spent three weeks on muscle relaxers.

Character 1: Can we maybe just... leave it in the hallway? I mean, who really needs a couch in their apartment anyway, right?

Character 2: [slurring] The thing about these old brownstone doorways is they built them narrower than modern standards. You've got maybe thirty-two inches clearance, and that couch is easily thirty-six inches at its widest point.

Character 1: My arms are shaking so bad... I don't think I can hold this much longer without dropping it on my foot.

Character 2: Let's set it down for a minute and reassess. Sometimes you need to remove the legs first, or even take the door off its hinges to get that extra two inches of clearance.

Character 1: [cough] The dust from this thing is... getting everywhere... How long was this in storage anyway?

Character 2: Based on that smell, I'd guess at least five years. Storage units are basically time capsules of mold spores and dead skin cells, especially with fabric furniture like this.

Character 1: I'm sweating through my shirt and we haven't even gotten it past the first doorway yet... This is insane.

Character 2: The delivery guys charge two hundred bucks for a reason. They've got the straps, the dollies, the experience to not destroy their lumbar spine in the process.

Character 1: [angry] Well thanks for that helpful advice NOW, after I've already thrown out my back and probably torn something in my shoulder!

Character 2: I'm just saying for next time. Right now, let's focus on getting this thing either inside or back on the truck before someone calls the fire marshal about blocking the hallway.

Character 1: My legs are cramping up... I need water or something... Can you hold it steady for just a minute?

Character 2: I've got it, but we really should call someone with proper equipment. Your face is turning an alarming shade of red and that vein on your forehead looks ready to pop.

Character 1: Just... one more try... If we angle it this way and I squeeze through first...

Character 2: That's not going to work and you know it. Physics doesn't care how determined you are, this couch is simply too wide for this doorframe.

Character 1: Fine, you're right... Let's just... let's leave it here and figure something else out... I can't do this anymore.

Character 2: [cry loudly] I'm sorry I couldn't be more help! Watching you struggle like this reminds me of my dad before his heart attack, always pushing too hard!
