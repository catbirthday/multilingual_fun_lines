Character 1: Is this the ferry to the island?

Character 2: Indeed it is—we depart in precisely seventeen minutes. The crossing takes forty-two minutes in calm seas; today's running about forty-six with the eastern swell.

Character 1: You seem very exact about that.

Character 2: Twenty-three years piloting this route, you learn the rhythms. Every wave pattern, every wind shift... they all speak their own language if you listen close enough.

Character 1: That's a long time doing the same route.

Character 2: Same route, different ocean every single day. Yesterday we had dolphins racing the bow for seven minutes; Tuesday, a fog so thick you couldn't see your own hand.

Character 1: Do you ever get bored?

Character 2: Bored? Never—the water's always teaching you something new. Last week I discovered a two-degree course adjustment saves three gallons of fuel per crossing.

Character 1: Three gallons doesn't sound like much.

Character 2: [yawn] Four crossings daily, six days a week... that's 3,744 gallons annually. Small adjustments compound into massive changes over time—that's the secret of navigation.

Character 1: You calculated that in your head?

Character 2: Numbers are just patterns; once you see them clearly, they practically solve themselves. Like how this ferry weighs 847 tons but displaces exactly the right amount of water to float.

Character 1: How do you know all this stuff?

Character 2: You spend enough time with something, it becomes part of you. I can feel when we're two pounds over optimal trim just by how she responds to the wheel.

Character 1: Two pounds? That's impossible.

Character 2: The ferry speaks through vibrations—frequency changes at different loads. Most people can't hear it, but after two decades, your body becomes a tuning fork for the ship.

Character 1: You're not really human, are you?

Character 2: Human as they come, just... attentive. The ocean demands complete presence; half-attention gets people killed out here, so you learn to notice everything.

Character 1: Everything?

Character 2: [very meekly] Well, almost everything. Still can't figure out why the vending machine on deck two only takes quarters on Thursdays.
