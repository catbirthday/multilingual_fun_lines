Character 1: I got your email about the reunion. Do I have to come?

Character 2: [short pause] Oh! Um, well, no—attendance is never mandatory, but honestly, these events are, like, really valuable for networking and reconnecting with your cohort, you know? Plus we've got some pretty exciting announcements about the new campus expansion this year.

Character 1: Networking. That's all you people care about.

Character 2: [flirtatious] Ahh, I mean, there's definitely more to it than that! We're actually bringing in this incredible panel of graduates who've done these, um, really unconventional things with their degrees—one person literally started a mushroom leather company, which is kind of wild, right?

Character 1: Mushroom leather. How does that even relate to my psychology degree?

Character 2: [relieved] Oh good question! So yeah, interdisciplinary innovation is actually, like, the whole theme this year—we're trying to show how different fields intersect in really unexpected ways, and honestly, psychology plays into literally everything from product design to, uh, ethical sourcing decisions.

Character 1: You sound like you're reading from a brochure.

Character 2: Hah, no, I just—I get really excited about this stuff because, um, last year we had this psych grad who used behavioral economics to basically revolutionize how this nonprofit distributes food, and now they're feeding like three times as many families with the same budget.

Character 1: Three times. Sure. You have data on that?

Character 2: Actually, yes! We, errr, we published a whole case study in the alumni magazine—their model reduced decision fatigue at distribution points by, I think it was 67%, which meant families could actually make better nutritional choices instead of just grabbing whatever.

Character 1: Decision fatigue at food banks. That's your big success story?

Character 2: Well, I mean, when you're talking about 42,000 families getting consistent access to fresh produce instead of just canned goods, yeah, that's... that's pretty significant impact from one person applying their education creatively, you know?

Character 1: One person didn't do all that alone.

Character 2: Oh absolutely not—that's actually another thing we emphasize at these events, like, collaboration is essential! The grad worked with nutritionists, logistics experts, um, community organizers... but their psychology background was literally the catalyst that made everyone else's expertise click together effectively.

Character 1: So you want me to come hear about other people's success.

Character 2: Mmm, it's more about, uh, seeing possibilities? Like, we've got workshops on grant writing, mentorship matching, even this session on translating academic skills to, you know, real-world applications—things that honestly nobody teaches you in undergrad but everyone needs to know.

Character 1: Nobody taught it because it wasn't relevant then.

Character 2: Yeah, fair point actually—timing matters a lot with this stuff, which is why we wait until people have been out for a few years, have some context for what they actually need versus what they, um, thought they'd need back in school.

Character 1: And you think I need this now?

Character 2: [bored] Honestly? I have no idea what you specifically need, but statistically speaking, 78% of attendees make at least one connection that leads to either a job opportunity or collaborative project within six months, so... those are pretty decent odds if you're looking for something different.
