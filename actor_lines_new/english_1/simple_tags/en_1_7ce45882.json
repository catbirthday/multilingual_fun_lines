            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[irritated] My family has operated shipping lines since before your country existed, Agent Morrison. [clears throat] We've survived two world wars, countless economic crashes, and yes, the occasional overzealous investigator who sees conspiracies in routine maritime operations."

            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",
