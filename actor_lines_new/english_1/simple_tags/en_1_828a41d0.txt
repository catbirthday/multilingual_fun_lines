Scenario: A skip tracer and journalist cross paths at a motel where they've both tracked down the same whistleblower who exposed corporate fraud—one hired to bring them back, the other desperate for an interview.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [calmly] Room 237, second floor, blue Honda Civic with Nevada plates parked outside. [pause] I'm guessing you're not here for the continental breakfast either, so let's save ourselves some trouble and figure out who gets to knock first.

Character 2: Look, I don't know who hired you, but I've been tracking Marcus Chen for three months. [anxiously] This story could expose the entire pharmaceutical pricing scandal, save thousands of lives.

Character 1: [matter-of-factly] That's a noble cause, really touching, but my client paid me forty thousand upfront to bring Chen back to face his contractual obligations. [sighs] Your Pulitzer dreams don't pay my mortgage.

Character 2: [desperately] Give me one hour with him. [pleading] Just one hour to get his testimony on record before you drag him back to whatever corporate hellhole wants him silenced.

Character 1: [coolly] You know what happens when skip tracers start making deals with journalists? [pause] They stop getting hired, and then they stop eating, and then they become the ones being tracked down.

Character 2: [frustrated] So that's it? You're just going to hand over a whistleblower to the same people who destroyed evidence of their drugs killing children? [voice rising] How do you sleep at night knowing you're part of their machine?

Character 1: On expensive sheets in a paid-off house. [flatly] Look, whatever sob story Chen sold you, he also embezzled two million dollars from his employer's pension fund before he developed his sudden conscience about pharmaceutical ethics.

Character 2: [shocked] That's not—he said the money was to secure evidence, to protect the documents. [stammering] He needed leverage against them because they were threatening his family.

Character 1: [unmoved] Sure, and every fugitive I track down was framed, innocent, or saving orphans. [exhales] The truth is everyone's the hero of their own story until the receipts come out.

Character 2: [urgently] Listen, what if I could guarantee you double your fee? [quickly] My editor has a discretionary fund for exactly this kind of situation, sources that need protection, complications that need resolving.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Double would be eighty thousand, and you'd need that in my account before I even consider letting you near that door. [pause] But even then, my reputation is worth more than one payday.

Character 2: [passionately] Your reputation? What about those dead kids, seventeen of them under the age of ten who died from liver failure because Chen's company knew their drug was toxic and buried the data? [voice breaking] I have their photos in my car.

Character 1: Photos don't change the fact that Chen signed a contract, took the money, and ran. [firmly] My job isn't to judge who deserves justice, it's to complete the retrieval.

Character 2: [bitterly] Right. Just following orders.

Character 1: [quietly] You know what? Chen's probably listening to this entire conversation through the door right now, deciding whether to run out the back while we argue about morality. [chuckles] So here's my offer.

Character 2: [hopefully] You're saying we could work together? [eagerly] We both get what we want if we coordinate this, because if he runs now, neither of us wins and those families get nothing.

Character 1: [decisively] You get twenty minutes to record whatever confession or testimony you need, but I'm in the room the entire time. [sternly] After that, he comes with me, no arguments, no drama, no calling your cop friends.

Character 2: [relieved] Twenty minutes to expose a conspiracy that killed children and destroyed families. [sighs] It's not enough time, but it's more than those kids got, so yes, deal.

Character 1: [professionally] Good. And just so we're clear, if you try anything clever like signaling him to run or slipping him a phone, I've got two associates covering the exits. [pause] Ready to knock?

Character 2: [nervously] Wait, before we go in, I need to know one thing. [quietly] When you find out twenty minutes from now that everything I'm telling you about those dead kids is true, documented, proven beyond doubt—will you still hand him over?
