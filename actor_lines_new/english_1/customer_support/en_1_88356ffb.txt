=== Dialogue ===

Customer: *sharp inhale* Thank you so much for picking up, I really—I'm sorry, let me start over—I'm calling about my medication delivery?

Customer Support: Got it. Let me pull that up. Account number or phone?

Customer: It's under 555-0291, and honestly I'm just so grateful someone answered because I've been trying to track this all morning.

Customer Support: Found it. Order MED-4472-NPQ. Shows shipped Monday. Should've arrived yesterday. That's... weird. Let me check the tracking.

Customer: *exhale* Yeah, exactly, and I really appreciate you looking into this because I only have two pills left and I don't—wait, does it show where it is?

Customer Support: Hmm. So. Tracking says. Still in Memphis? Since Tuesday morning at 3:47 AM. No movement. That's definitely not right.

Customer: Memphis? But I'm in Seattle, why would—no wait, that doesn't matter—*sharp breath* can you get it here by tomorrow?

Customer Support: Okay okay. Let me. Think through options here. Your prescription. Metformin 500mg. Quantity 90. Right?

Customer: Yes, that's it, and you're being so helpful, I just—I'm starting to really panic here because what happens if I run out?

Customer Support: Hey. Listen. We're gonna fix this. First option. Express replacement. New order ships tonight. Arrives tomorrow before noon. Order ID would be MED-4473-NPQ. No charge.

Customer: *exhale* Oh thank god, yes please, that would be—wait, tomorrow before noon for sure? Because I take it at breakfast and if it's late—

Customer Support: Absolutely. Guaranteed delivery. 11:59 AM latest. Tracking updates every 2 hours starting at midnight. You'll get texts.

Customer: You're literally saving my life here, I can't—*breath catches* what if this one gets stuck too though? Should I also call my doctor?

Customer Support: Smart thinking. Yes. Call them. Get a 3-day emergency supply. Just in case. Most pharmacies fill those same-day with doctor approval.

Customer: Okay, okay, I'm writing this down—emergency supply, and then—sorry, I'm all over the place—you said no charge for the replacement?

Customer Support: Right right. Zero charge. Already processed. Confirmation email sent. Check spam if you don't see it.

Customer: *sharp inhale* You've been incredible, seriously, I was so scared and now—wait, what about the stuck one? Do I return it if it shows up?

Customer Support: Keep it. Extra supply. The stuck package. We'll file a claim with carrier. Reference number CL-982741-MPS. Our problem. Not yours.

Customer: I just—thank you doesn't even cover it, you've made this so much easier than I thought—*exhale* I'm actually breathing again.

Customer Support: Good. That's what matters. You're all set. Meds tomorrow. Emergency backup plan today. And hey. These things happen. But we got you covered. Order MED-4473-NPQ. Tomorrow before noon. Promise.
