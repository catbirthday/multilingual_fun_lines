Customer: Good afternoon. I need to dispute a charge on my account from your company, please.

Customer Support: Good afternoon and thank you for calling. I'll be happy to assist you with that dispute today. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your account?

Customer: My email is sarah.martinez at oceanview dot com. The charge is from November third.

Customer Support: Thank you, Ms. Martinez. I've located your account ending in -8274. I can see a charge from November 3rd for $189.99. Could you tell me more about why you're disputing this particular transaction?

Customer: I ordered one certification course for forty-nine dollars. You charged me for a premium package I never selected.

Customer Support: I understand your concern completely. Let me review your order details here. I can see order number ORD-11032024-MTZ showing an initial selection of our Basic Lifeguard Recertification course at $49.00.

Customer: Exactly. That's all I ordered. Please explain why I was charged nearly four times that amount.

Customer Support: I'm reviewing the transaction history now. It appears that on November 3rd at 2:47 PM, the system processed an upgrade to our Premium Package PRM-LG500. Let me investigate further to understand how this occurred.

Customer: I never authorized any upgrade. I specifically chose the basic option and confirmed it twice.

Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for this error. According to our records, there's no confirmation click-through for the upgrade, which indicates this was likely a system processing error on our end.

Customer: Good. What are the next steps to get this corrected and receive my refund?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm initiating a partial refund of $140.99 right now, which is the difference between the premium package and your intended purchase. Your refund reference number is RFN-2024-11-18-SMZ.

Customer: Thank you. How long will it take to see this refund on my credit card?

Customer Support: The refund will be processed within 24 hours on our end. Depending on your card issuer, you should see the credit appear within 3 to 5 business days, no later than November 25th.

Customer: I appreciate that. Will I still have access to the basic certification course I originally wanted?

Customer Support: Yes, absolutely. I'm adjusting your account right now to reflect the Basic Lifeguard Recertification access. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next 10 minutes to sarah.martinez at oceanview dot com.

Customer: Perfect. Can you also send documentation about this dispute resolution for my records?

Customer Support: Certainly. I'm preparing a detailed dispute resolution letter with case number DSP-181124-7294. This document will include all transaction details, the refund amount, and expected timeline. You'll receive this within the hour.

Customer: Excellent. Thank you for resolving this so quickly. I was nervous about disputing this charge.

Customer Support: You're very welcome, Ms. Martinez. You handled this perfectly, and I'm glad we could resolve it promptly. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your account or certification access today?
