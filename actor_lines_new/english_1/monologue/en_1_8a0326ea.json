Three months of data, seventeen documented cases of liver damage, and they just— they sat there and told me it wasn't \"statistically significant.\" [bitter] Statistically significant. [pause] People are getting sick. [frustrated] I showed them the charts, the blood work, everything, and Richards just kept checking his phone while I was talking. [sarcastic] Very professional. [anxious] The thing is, I know what happens to people who push too hard on this stuff. [quietly] Sarah from the Boston office tried to flag something similar last year and she's, um... she's not with the company anymore. [sigh] But these patients, they trust us. [upset] They take these pills thinking we've done our job, thinking someone like me is looking out for them. [shaky voice] And I am. I'm trying to. [angry] But apparently quarterly earnings matter more than whether someone's liver shuts down. [pause] [determined] I kept copies of everything. The original report, the emails, all of it. [hesitantly] Maybe I should, um... maybe I should reach out to someone at the FDA directly? [nervous] God, that could end my whole career. [long pause] [resolved] But if I don't say something and more people get hurt... [trailing off] I don't think I could live with that."
