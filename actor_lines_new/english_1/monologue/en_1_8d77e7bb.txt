Subject: Finally earning respect as the foe in your professional rivalry, but realizing the competition consumed years of your life

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] She finally said it. After all these years, she actually said I was... that I was brilliant. [pause] God, I've been waiting for those words since, what, 2018? [bitter] Six years of trying to one-up each other, six years of staying late just to outdo whatever presentation she'd given that morning. [sigh] And now she respects me. [quietly] The thing is, um... I don't even remember why we started competing. Was it that promotion? The Henderson account? [confused] It all just blurred together into this constant need to win. [regretful] I missed my daughter's recitals for quarterly reviews that she'd be at. Skipped vacations because I knew she'd use that time to get ahead. [laughs] My marriage almost— [trailing off] well. [sad] And for what? This moment? Her saying "you're a worthy opponent"? [increasingly upset] I'm forty-three years old and I've spent the last six years in a pissing contest with someone who probably went home and forgot about me every night. [long pause] While I was lying awake strategizing. [very melancholic] She has kids now. Two of them. Met someone, got married, whole life outside of this... whatever this was. [sigh] And I have what? [bitterly] Her respect. [pause] Great. That'll keep me company at night.
