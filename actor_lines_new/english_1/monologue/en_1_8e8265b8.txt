=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I keep seeing it happen over and over in my head. [very sad] Three weeks I spent checking those cables, marking every single wear point with tape. [angry] I wrote it in the report—maximum load exceeded, needs immediate replacement. [frustrated] I highlighted it, I emailed it, I literally walked it to the production manager's office myself. [bitter] "We'll look into it after opening night," he said. [pause] After opening night. [furious] Like the laws of physics were going to wait for their schedule! [shaky voice] And now Sarah's in the hospital with a shattered pelvis because they wanted to save, what, two thousand dollars? [upset] She trusted that rig because she trusted me. [very quietly] She looked me in the eye before going up and I nodded—I nodded like it was safe. [crying while speaking] I should have refused to let the show go on. [regretful] Should have called OSHA myself, should have done... something more. [anxious] They're saying she might not perform again. [very melancholic] Twenty-three years old and her career could be over because someone decided my expertise was, um, negotiable. [sigh] The worst part is they're acting surprised now. [mocking] "How could this have happened?" [shouting] I TOLD YOU HOW! [exhausted] I literally told you exactly how this would happen. [very sad] And Sarah paid the price for their arrogance.
