Subject: Discovering your trusted wealth manager embezzled your entire retirement fund

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] There has to be some mistake. This can't—I'm looking at zeros. All zeros. [pause] Twenty-three years of savings and it's... wait, let me refresh this again. [anxious] Still zeros. Oh God. Umm, okay, maybe the system is down? [nervous laugh] Right? Because Tom wouldn't—he's managed my money for fifteen years. [shaky voice] We had dinner at his house last month. His kids call me Uncle. 

[very quietly] But the account activity shows... transfers. Multiple transfers to accounts I don't recognize. [speeding up] Last Tuesday, Thursday, yesterday—oh my God, yesterday while we were on the phone discussing my retirement plans. [gasp loudly] He was literally stealing from me while telling me about beach houses.

[furious] That son of a bitch! [pause] Everything. He took everything. My dad's life insurance payout, the... the money from selling Mom's house after she died. [crying while speaking] I was going to retire next year. I'm sixty-one years old, what am I supposed to—[long pause]

[very sad] I trusted him with my entire future. [sigh] How do you even, um... how do you come back from this? [trailing off] I don't even know who to call first...
