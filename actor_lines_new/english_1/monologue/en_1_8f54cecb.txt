=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I still can't believe it happened. We were all just sleeping and—Bear started going absolutely crazy at like three in the morning. [frustrated] I was so annoyed, you know? I mean, we've only had him for what, six weeks? And he's barking and pawing at our bedroom door and I'm thinking oh great, another accident or something. [pause] But he wouldn't stop. He was, um... he was pulling at my pajama sleeve, whining, just frantic. So I finally get up and he's literally dragging me toward the basement door and that's when I smelled it. [anxious] Just this horrible rotten egg smell everywhere. [whispering] The furnace guy said if we'd stayed asleep another hour... [pause] I can't even—my kids were in that house. [crying while speaking] This dog that someone just threw away, that sat in that shelter for eight months because nobody wanted him, he saved us. [sniffle] All of us. My whole family. [warm] And now he's sleeping on our bed every night because, I mean, how do you even thank a dog for that? [laugh] You just... you give him everything, right? [very sincerely] He gave us our lives back.
