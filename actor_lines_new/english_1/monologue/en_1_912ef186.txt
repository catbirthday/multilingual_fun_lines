Subject: Finally standing up to your bully, only to learn they were acting out because of abuse at home

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I finally did it. I actually stood up to Jake today. [confidently] Told him I was done being his punching bag, done with the constant... the constant everything. God, you should've seen his face when I just—when I didn't back down this time. [angry] Three years of this crap and I finally said what I've been rehearsing in my head every single night. 

[pause] 

But then Mrs. Chen pulled me aside after and... oof. She told me about his situation. [confused] I didn't know his dad was—I mean, how would I know, right? Nobody talks about that stuff. [hesitantly] She said he comes to school with bruises sometimes, hidden ones, and that CPS has been... they've been involved for months now. 

[very quietly] He literally flinched when I raised my voice at him. 

I keep thinking about all those times he shoved me around and now I'm wondering if that's just... is that what happens to him at home? But worse? [sad] Like, that doesn't make what he did okay, obviously, it doesn't erase three years of hell, but... hmm... I don't know what to do with this information. [sigh] Part of me is still furious, you know? But another part is just... God. [empathetically] Nobody deserves that. Not even Jake.
