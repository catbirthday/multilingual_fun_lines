[pause] And I'm just sitting there with grease under my fingernails thinking, man, this isn't just about keeping grass short, you know? [empathetically] He's got these tomato plants his daughter helped him plant, and he checks on them every morning like they're, I don't know, like they're keeping him tethered to something real. [sigh] The thing is, when he first asked me to look at the mower, I thought it was just, er, another quick fix for a neighbor. [quietly] But then I saw how his hands shake sometimes when he talks about the noise it makes when it won't start properly. [hesitantly] It's like... it's not about the machine breaking down, it's about him not being able to maintain this one thing that's actually helping him heal, you know? [passionately] So now I'm over there every week, making sure everything runs smooth—the mower, the edger, that old tiller he uses for the vegetable beds. [smiling speaking] Yesterday he gave me a bag of tomatoes and said I'm part of his recovery team. [pause] [very sincerely] I just fix lawn equipment, but somehow, hmm, somehow this feels like the most important work I've ever done."
