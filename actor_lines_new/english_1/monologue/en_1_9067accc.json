[gasp] Right behind a car that was backing up. The driver had no idea. None. And this cart guy, he just— [very quickly] he dropped everything and sprinted, I mean sprinted, grabbed the kid literally inches from the bumper. [pause] I thought I was about to watch something horrible happen. My whole body just froze. [relieved] But he got there. He actually got there in time. The mom was, um, she was inside getting another kid out of the car seat, she didn't even see it happening until— [emotional] God, the look on her face when she realized. [sigh] She just kept saying thank you over and over, crying, holding her kid so tight. [warm] And the cart attendant, this teenager probably making minimum wage, he just... he kept saying it was nothing, that he was glad he saw it. [pause] Nothing. He called saving a kid's life nothing. [very quietly] I don't think I've ever seen anything that, uh, that pure before. Just instant, selfless reaction. [shaky voice] I'm still shaking. That was so close. So, so close."
