=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] They just told me. [pause] Regional manager. [laugh] Five years of—of killing myself for this and they finally... [trailing off] God, I should be ecstatic right? [confused] But I'm sitting here in the parking lot and I just feel, um... nothing? [bitter] No wait, that's not true. I feel like I want to throw up. [nervous laugh] 

[quietly] You know what's funny? I practiced my acceptance speech. [sarcastic] "Thank you so much for this opportunity, I won't let you down." [pause] But when Sharon said it, all I could think about was, er... was how her voice sounded exactly like the hold music. [frustrated] That same dead corporate drone and I thought—I thought, oh God, that's gonna be me. 

[anxious] I mean, what am I supposed to do now? [speeding up] Turn it down? After everything? My dad would—Jesus, he'd lose his mind. [sigh] "Finally making something of yourself." [mocking] 

[very quietly] But I can't do another five years here. [shaky voice] I can't become another Sharon, walking around with that fake smile, pretending these quarterly reports actually, like, matter. [long pause] 

[exhausted] Thirty-two years old and I just figured out I've been climbing the wrong ladder. [laugh] Congratulations to me, I guess.
