=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] You know what's crazy? Six months ago, I couldn't even order pizza on the phone without rehearsing what I'd say. [chuckle] And today—today I stood in front of twelve school board members and fought for my daughter. [confidently] I actually did it. When they tried to deny her the one-on-one aide, I didn't back down. [passionately] I had my notes, I had my research, I quoted the actual regulations back to them! The superintendent actually, um... he actually interrupted me at one point, trying to say budget constraints were an issue. [stern] And I just looked him straight in the eye and said "My child's education is not negotiable." [gasp softly] I can't believe those words came out of my mouth. [very sincerely] That public speaking course—God, I almost didn't sign up for it. [laugh] I was terrified! But standing at that podium today, my voice was steady. [proud] My hands weren't even shaking. When they approved everything—the aide, the speech therapy, the sensory breaks—I almost cried right there. [sniffle] Actually, I did cry. [happy] In the parking lot, but still. My little girl is going to get what she needs. [warm] All because I finally learned how to make people listen. [trailing off] All those practice speeches about random topics... who knew they'd lead to this.
