=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Three hundred thousand dollars. [pause] Three hundred thousand, not the hundred thousand you told me. [bitter] God, I feel so stupid. [sigh] I'm sitting here with our bank statements spread across the kitchen table, and the numbers just keep— [very quietly] they don't make sense with what you said. [frustrated] You looked me in the eye at dinner with my parents and told them we were "managing just fine" with your loans. [laugh] Managing! [angry] How is triple the amount "managing"? [long pause] [confused] The thing is, I get being embarrassed about debt, I really do. [upset] But we got married. [voice breaking] We stood there and promised each other everything, and you were already lying to me. [sniffle] You thought I'd leave you? [hurt] Is that really what you think of me? [very sad] That I'm so shallow I'd walk away from the person I love over, um... over money? [pause] [quietly] Maybe that hurts more than the lie itself. [exhausted] I don't even know what to do with this. We just got back from our honeymoon, for God's sake. [sarcastic] Happy one month anniversary to us, right? [very melancholic] I keep looking at our wedding photos on the mantle, and I just... [trailing off] I thought I knew you.
