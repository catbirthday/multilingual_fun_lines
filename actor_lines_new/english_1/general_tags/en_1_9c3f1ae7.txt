=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hushed] They told me this was a safe house, that I could, um, stay here for a few days until they arrange the next part, but I didn't know anyone would actually be living here.

Character 2: [gently] Oh, child, you look exhausted—when did you last eat something proper, hmm? Come sit down, I've got some soup on the stove that's been simmering since morning.

Character 1: I shouldn't be taking your food, I mean, they already paid for me to be here, and I don't want to cause any more trouble than I, uh, than I already have. [nervous exhale]

Character 2: Nonsense, you're skin and bones, and nobody under my roof goes hungry, no matter how they arrived here—that's been my rule for, oh, must be sixty years now. [sighs]

Character 1: [cautiously] You've been doing this for sixty years? Helping people like me, I mean, people who are... who don't have papers or anything?

Character 2: Not exactly like this, dear, but I've always believed in, well, in giving people second chances when the world hasn't been kind to them. [pause] Though lately the people who come through are different, younger, more frightened.

Character 1: The man who brought me here, he said his grandmother owned this place, but I thought he was lying to make me feel, um, safer or something.

Character 2: [sadly] That would be Marcus, my youngest daughter's boy—he's gotten himself into some terrible business these past few years, bringing people across borders for money.

Character 1: [stunned] Wait, you know what he does?

Character 2: Of course I know, child, I'm old but I'm not blind or stupid—I see the fear in the eyes of everyone he brings here, the bruises they try to hide. [voice breaking slightly]

Character 1: But you still let him use your house? Even knowing that he's, that we're basically, um, his merchandise, his way of making money off desperate people?

Character 2: [wearily] What choice do I have, hmm? If I refuse, he'll just take you somewhere worse, somewhere without clean beds or hot meals or someone to make sure you're treated like a human being.

Character 1: He told me I owed him fifteen thousand dollars for the journey, that I'd have to work it off somehow, but he wouldn't say how exactly. [trembling]

Character 2: [firmly] Not while you're under my roof, you won't—whatever debt he thinks you owe, that's between him and his conscience, if he still has one.

Character 1: You can't protect me from him forever though, I mean, eventually I have to leave here and then what happens to me? [voice cracking]

Character 2: [softly] I've been setting aside money for years, little bits here and there from my pension, and I think, well, I think it might be enough to buy your freedom from him.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Why would you do that for me? You don't even know my name, where I'm from, anything about who I am or what I've done.

Character 2: [gently] Because somewhere out there, you have a mother or a grandmother who's probably sick with worry, wondering if you're safe, if you're being treated with kindness. [pause] I'd want someone to do the same for Marcus if he was lost and afraid.

Character 1: But he's the one doing this to people like me, he's the reason I'm here in the first place, owing money I'll never be able to repay. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: I know, dear, and that's my burden to carry—that I raised a daughter who raised a son who could do such things, but maybe, just maybe, I can balance the scales a little by helping you. [sighs heavily]
