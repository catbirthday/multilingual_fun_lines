=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] I need something from you, something I never thought I'd have to ask for, and I know how this must look after all these years of silence between us.

Character 2: [measured] You're standing in my workshop at midnight wearing a hood, asking for a blade. Whatever this is about, it's not good. [exhales] Tell me who's threatening you.

Character 1: There's a magistrate who's become obsessed, won't accept that our arrangement has ended, and he's made it clear that rejection isn't something he tolerates well.

Character 2: [grimly] Magistrate Corwin—I've heard the rumors about what happens to women who cross him. How long has this been escalating?

Character 1: Three weeks now.

Character 2: [sharply] Three weeks?

Character 1: Don't judge me.

Character 2: [softer] I'm not judging, I'm calculating how much time we have before he does something irreversible. Show me your hands—I need to know what kind of grip will work for you.

Character 1: My hands are steady enough when they need to be, though I've never held anything more dangerous than a wine glass or a fan. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [firmly] This blade I'm thinking of, it's small enough to hide in your corset boning but sharp enough to cut through leather and flesh if needed—you'll need to practice the draw every night.

Character 1: You're talking like you've already decided to help me, even though we haven't spoken since you found out what I'd become.

Character 2: [heated] What you became was irrelevant the moment someone threatened your life. You think I care more about propriety than keeping you alive?

Character 1: Most would.

Character 2: I'm not most people, never have been, which is why you came here instead of buying something crude from the market. [coughs] Let me show you something special.

Character 1: [watching intently] The steel has this pattern like flowing water—I've never seen metalwork this beautiful, almost seems wrong to use it for violence.

Character 2: Beauty and violence aren't opposites; sometimes the most beautiful things are the most dangerous. This Damascus steel took me four months to forge properly. [proudly] It's my masterwork.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] I can't possibly afford something like this, even with what the wealthy patrons pay, this is worth more than I could earn in a year.

Character 2: The price?

Character 1: [quietly] Don't mock me.

Character 2: [gently] The price is that you survive, and maybe one day we can have tea like we used to, before everything got complicated. That's all.
