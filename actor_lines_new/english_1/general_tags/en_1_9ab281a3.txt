=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled] I saw your name on the residency paperwork when I was checking the green room schedule, and I thought it had to be someone else with the same name.

Character 2: Well, it's not exactly a common name, so I guess we both know this isn't a coincidence anymore. [clears throat]

Character 1: Fifteen years, Dad. Fifteen years of nothing, and now you're just here, sleeping in the quarters above where I've worked for the past three seasons.

Character 2: [quietly] I didn't know you worked here when I applied for the residency, I swear, but when I saw your name on the crew list, I couldn't just leave.

Character 1: You couldn't leave? That's rich, considering how good you were at it the first time around when Mom got sick.

Character 2: I know how it looked, but there were things happening then that you didn't understand, things I'm still not proud of. [pause]

Character 1: [voice cracking] I was twelve years old, trying to figure out how to work her oxygen machine while you were god knows where doing god knows what.

Character 2: Prison. I was in prison for eighteen months, and your mother made me promise never to tell you because she thought you'd be better off not knowing.

Character 1: [stunned] What? Mom said you were touring with that production company in Europe, that you chose the work over us.

Character 2: She was protecting you from the truth about why I got arrested, about the debts I'd accumulated trying to pay for her experimental treatments. [voice breaking]

Character 1: So you're telling me everything I believed about why you left, everything that shaped who I became, was based on a lie?

Character 2: [desperately] Not a lie, a choice your mother made out of love, though I see now how much damage it did to both of us.

Character 1: The medical bills, the ones that kept appearing even after she died, those were from treatments you arranged? We thought they were billing errors.

Character 2: I kept paying what I could from inside, then after, working under the table jobs because my record made it impossible to get legitimate work. [exhales shakily]

Character 1: [softer] The theater board doesn't know about your record, do they? That's why you're using Mom's maiden name on the residency application.

Character 2: They'd cancel my residency immediately if they knew, but I had to take the chance when I heard you might be here. [sighs]

Character 1: I could report you right now, get you thrown out, and honestly part of me wants to after everything we went through thinking you abandoned us.

Character 2: [bravely] Then do it. I'd understand completely, but just know that every single day for fifteen years, I've regretted not fighting harder to tell you the truth.

Character 1: [voice trembling] I don't know what to do with this, with you being here, with everything being different than what I thought.

Character 2: Just think about it.
