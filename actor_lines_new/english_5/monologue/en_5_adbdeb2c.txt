Subject: Your rigging artist safety protocols were ignored, resulting in a performer's serious injury that could have been prevented

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I keep replaying it in my head. I wrote those protocols for a reason, you know? [pause] Three weeks I spent testing every single attachment point, calculating load limits, and they just... they ignored all of it. [frustrated] I literally highlighted the section about checking the secondary safety cable—I mean, I used bright yellow highlighter and everything. [sigh] And now Sarah's in the hospital with, um... with a fractured pelvis and I can't stop thinking that if they'd just listened—[voice breaking] God, her scream when she fell. [very quietly] Twenty feet straight down. 

[angry] The production manager said my protocols were "overly cautious." Can you believe that? [bitter] Overly cautious. [pause] I've been doing aerial rigging for twelve years and I've never—never—had someone get hurt on my watch until they decided to, what, save fifteen minutes? [upset] Sarah trusted us. She trusted that we'd keep her safe up there. [sniffle] 

[regretful] I should've refused to let the show go on. Should've walked off, called the union, something. [very sad] But I just... I thought maybe I was being too rigid, you know? Maybe I was overreacting. [crying while speaking] Except I wasn't, was I? I wasn't overreacting at all.
