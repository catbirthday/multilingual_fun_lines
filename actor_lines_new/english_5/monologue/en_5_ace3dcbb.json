[pause] Wait, these bookings from last month—the Henderson family trip to Bali? They paid eight thousand dollars but there's no corresponding payment to the airline or hotel. [anxious] Oh God. Oh God, no no no. [speeding up] The Johnsons' anniversary cruise, the Martinez honeymoon package, the school group to Europe—none of these have actual reservations. [gasp loudly] Marcus has been taking their money and just... what, pretending to book trips? [shaky voice] These people trusted us. They trusted ME. [angry] How could he do this? We've been partners for six years! Six years! [pause] I vouched for him to every single client. [bitter] \"Oh, Marcus is wonderful, he'll take care of everything.\" [laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. [very sad] Mrs. Chen called yesterday asking about her confirmation number for next week. What am I supposed to tell her? That her dream vacation to see her grandchildren doesn't exist? That the money she saved for two years is just, um... gone? [frustrated] I'm going to lose everything. The business, my reputation, probably my house when the lawsuits start. [crying while speaking] And Marcus? He's probably already halfway to Costa Rica with everyone's money."
