Two whole years of city council meetings and petitions and everyone telling me I was, um... that I was being unrealistic. [laugh] And now look! [passionately] Riverside Park is going to be beautiful again! Not just, you know, not just picked up but actually restored—the wetlands, the trails, everything we asked for. [very quietly] I keep thinking I'm going to wake up and this won't be real. [chuckle] My mom called me crying when she heard. She said, \"You did it, baby. You actually did it.\" [warm] And I just... I mean, all those Saturday mornings standing outside the grocery store with clipboards, basically begging people to sign. [groan] God, my feet hurt just thinking about it. [excited] But we got eight thousand signatures! Eight thousand! [shaky voice] I'm sorry, I'm just—this means so much. [confidently] Kids are going to have a safe place to play again. The herons might actually come back to nest. [sigh] I should probably call everyone who helped but I just need to, um... I need to sit with this for a minute. [smiling speaking] We won. We actually won."
