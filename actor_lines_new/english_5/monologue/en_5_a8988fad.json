He stood right there by the dumpster, stuffing his face, telling me it was fine because they were getting thrown out anyway. [angry] And now I'M fired? For theft? [pause] He looked me straight in the eye during that meeting, sitting there next to the district manager, and he just... he let them think it was me. [bitter] Three years. Three years I've been bagging groceries, never late, always covering shifts, and this is what I get? [quietly] The security footage probably shows him clear as day but, um, but I guess nobody's gonna check that, right? [sarcastic] Why would they? It's just easier to fire the part-timer. [upset] My mom's gonna kill me. I needed this job for college. I needed— [trailing off] [pause] [very sad] You know what the worst part is? I actually liked Marcus. Thought he was cool. He'd joke around during slow shifts, buy us energy drinks sometimes. [laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. [exhausted] Twenty-three dollars in damaged cookies. That's what my job was worth to him. Twenty-three dollars."
