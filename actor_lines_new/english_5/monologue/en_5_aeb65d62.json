[warm] And last night she just— she wouldn't stop barking. [confused] We thought maybe she needed to go out, but she kept pulling at my pajama sleeve, just yanking and yanking. [anxious] And then I smelled it. [gasp softly] That rotten egg smell, you know? [very quietly] The gas was just pouring out from behind the stove. [shaky voice] The pilot light had gone out somehow and the whole kitchen was just filling up with it. [upset] We could've all died in our sleep. [pause] Emma, Jake, all of us just... gone. [crying while speaking] If Bella hadn't woken me up, if she hadn't been so insistent about it— [sniffle] The fire department said we were maybe an hour away from, um, from real danger. [relieved] One hour. [very slowly] This dog we rescued from being put down, and she turned around and rescued us right back. [happy] She's getting steak for dinner for the rest of her life, I don't care what the vet says about her diet. [laugh] She's our guardian angel with muddy paws. [very sincerely] How do you even thank a dog for something like that?"
