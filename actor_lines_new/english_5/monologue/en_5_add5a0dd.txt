=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Wait, are you serious right now? [gasp loudly] Jake's been... he's been talking about me behind my back? [confused] For years? I mean, I thought we were—hmm, I guess I thought we were actually getting along. [hurt] All those times at dinner when Mom would randomly bring up my "attitude problems" or whatever... [angry] that was him? [pause] God, I'm such an idiot. [bitter] I actually defended him last week when Dad said he seemed, um, I don't know, manipulative or something. [sarcastic] Oh wow, guess Dad was onto something, huh? [frustrated] The thing is, I've been trying so hard to make this whole blended family thing work, you know? [very sad] Like genuinely trying. And he's been—what, just systematically turning them against me? [furious] Who does that? [short pause] Actually, wait, this explains so much. [speeding up] The weird looks, the sudden groundings, Mom asking me if I'm "okay" all the time like I'm some kind of... [trailing off] [long pause] You know what's really messed up? [quietly] I told him things. [regretful] Personal things that I thought, er, I thought would help us bond or whatever. [cry] And he probably used all of it against me, didn't he? [shaky voice] God, I feel so stupid.
