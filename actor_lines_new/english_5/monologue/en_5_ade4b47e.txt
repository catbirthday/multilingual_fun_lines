=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] I passed. I actually passed the exam. [laugh] Four years of studying under Richard, and I— [pause] wait, are those FBI jackets? [anxious] That's Richard's office they're walking out of with those boxes. [stuttering] What the— what the hell is happening? [shaky voice] This can't be real. I literally just got the email twenty minutes ago saying I passed. [bitter] The highest score in my testing group, and now there's federal agents carrying evidence boxes out of the man who taught me everything. [sarcastic] Perfect timing, universe. Really fantastic. [upset] He told me integrity was everything in this business. [laugh loudly] Integrity! While he was, what, cooking books? [frustrated] I defended him to everyone who said he was too good to be true. [quietly] God, I'm such an idiot. [angry] Four years! Four years of my life learning from a criminal! [pause] [very slowly] My name is on documents in that office. [anxious] My signature, my... oh God, they're going to think I knew. [crying while speaking] I just wanted to help people invest wisely. That's all I wanted. [bitter] And now my license, this thing I worked so hard for, it's, um... it's worthless, isn't it? [very sad] Everything he taught me is tainted.
