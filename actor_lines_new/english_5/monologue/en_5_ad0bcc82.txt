Subject: Your volunteer work teaching seniors technology helped your own grandmother reconnect with family overseas

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] You know what's funny? I started volunteering at the senior center because I needed community service hours. [chuckle] Just checking off a box, really. [pause] But then I met this woman who reminded me so much of my grandma—same stubborn streak about technology, same frustrated hand gestures when the iPad wouldn't cooperate. [animated] And I thought, wait, if I can teach her FaceTime, maybe I can finally help Grandma too. [slowly] She'd been trying to call her sister in Korea for years but couldn't figure out international calling rates or any of that. [sad] Twenty years they'd only exchanged letters. Twenty years. [sigh] So I brought my laptop to her place, and we spent, um... god, like four hours just setting up her email. [laughing] She kept writing her password on sticky notes and losing them immediately. [excited] But when we finally got that first video call connected— [voice breaking] when she saw her sister's face moving, talking, laughing in real-time— [crying while speaking] she just grabbed my hand so tight and kept saying "look, look, she's right there." [sniffle] They talked for three hours that first call. [happy] Now she calls me her "computer genius granddaughter" to everyone at the grocery store. [very sincerely] I think about all those years they missed, and I'm just... I'm so grateful we figured it out while there was still time.
