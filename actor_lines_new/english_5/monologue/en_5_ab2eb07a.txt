=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Wait, they're giving everyone bonuses? Because of my system? [gasp softly] Oh my God, I just... I mean, I was just trying to make my own job easier, you know? [shy] I had no idea corporate was even paying attention. 

Honestly, when Sarah kept losing those returns in the back corner, I thought, hmm, there's gotta be a better way to organize this mess. [excited] And then Jake was always complaining about the scanner batteries dying, so I made those charging stations, and... oh wow, they're actually calling it "innovative"? [chuckle] 

The best part though? [warm] Tommy can finally fix his car now. He's been stressed about that transmission for, what, three months? And Maria, she was just telling me about her daughter's tuition bills. [very sincerely] I mean, that's what really matters here.

I keep thinking about all those late nights I spent mapping out the zones. [relieved] My wife thought I was crazy, drawing diagrams at the kitchen table. "It's just boxes," she'd say. But it wasn't just boxes, it was... I don't know, it was about making everyone's day a little less awful. [happy] And apparently, um, apparently that's worth something.
