=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look I've I've been paying you guys for twelve years, never missed a payment, and now you send me this this ridiculous form?

Customer Support: Oh wow. Twelve years. That's—let me pull up—okay I see your account here, policy number INS-4482-BK91. So the claim form. Yeah. These are. Hmm. Way too complicated. I hear this constantly.

Customer: I'm a construction worker, not a not a lawyer! Page three asks for "supplemental documentation of proximate causality" what does that even mean?

Customer Support: Right right. That's—jeez—let me translate. So basically. Proximate causality. They want proof. The damage. Was directly from. The incident. Like for claim 2024-11-SC447. Photos would work. Receipts. Witness statement maybe?

Customer: I just—I just need my truck fixed okay okay? The tree fell on it, insurance should cover it, why is this so complicated?

Customer Support: Absolutely should cover it. No question. Let me—actually wait—I'm gonna. Screen share. Can you see? So section 3A where it says. Estimated repair cost. Just put. What the shop quoted. Around $4,200 right?

Customer: Four thousand eight hundred actually... I can't I can't even figure out where to write that, there's like six different boxes

Customer Support: Oof yeah. Confusing layout. Put—hmm—the 4800. Goes in box 3A-2. Not 3A-1. That's for. Different damages. Then skip to. Uhh. Section 7. Everything between. Leave blank. Policy INS-4482-BK91 doesn't need those parts.

Customer: This is insane, I've I've been a loyal customer and they make it impossible to actually use the insurance I pay for

Customer Support: You're right. Completely right. It's—look I've worked here. Three years. Still takes me. Forever. To navigate these. Er. What if. I just fill it out. With you? Share my screen. Walk through each line?

Customer: Would you? God that would... I just... I'm so tired of trying to figure this out

Customer Support: Of course. Absolutely. So first. Claim number. Already populated. CL-2024-887K. Date of incident. November 15th. Time. You said around. Uhh. 2:30 PM right?

Customer: Two forty five, it was it was right after my lunch break, I remember because I'd just gotten back

Customer Support: Got it. 2:45 PM. Location. So that's—wait let me—1847 Industrial Parkway. Unit B7. Description of incident. I'll type. "Tree fell. During windstorm. Onto 2019 Ford F-150. License 7K9-M221. Causing damage to cab and bed."

Customer: Yeah that's that's right... wait do I need to mention the the toolbox in the back got crushed too?

Customer Support: Oh definitely. Yes. Actually—hmm—toolbox contents. Separate line item. Let me add. Section 4B. Personal property. Estimated value of tools? Ballpark. So we can file. Supplemental claim SP-9901.

Customer: Maybe three thousand? I don't I don't know, some of those tools I've had forever...

Customer Support: Three thousand works. We'll put. "Approximately $3,000." Can adjust later. With receipts. Oh also—er—weather report. From November 15th. Already attached. Wind speeds. 47 mph. Validates your claim.

Customer: I just... thank you... I was about to just give up on this whole thing

Customer Support: Never give up. Please. You paid. All those years. This is yours. Look we're—basically done. Just need. Your signature. Box 12C. Then I'll expedite. Should have. Check within. Let's see. Five business days. Maybe sooner.
