Scenario: A Medicaid eligibility worker visits their own landlord to plead for an extension on rent after their hours were cut, unaware the landlord is facing foreclosure.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Mr. Chen, I know this is incredibly unprofessional, but I need to ask for an extension on this month's rent—they cut our department's hours last week and my paycheck is going to be about forty percent less.

Character 2: You work for the county, don't you? Processing benefits and assistance applications? [hollow laugh]

Character 1: [quietly] I help people access Medicaid every single day, explain the income limits and qualification requirements, and now I'm sitting here asking you for the same kind of mercy I tell them they might not get.

Character 2: The irony isn't lost on me, trust me—I've had three tenants this month alone tell me they're waiting on assistance approvals that never seem to come through.

Character 1: [trembling] I can give you half by the fifth, and I'm picking up extra work transcribing medical records in the evenings, so maybe another quarter by the fifteenth if those invoices clear.

Character 2: [wearily] The bank sent me a notice yesterday—ninety days until they start foreclosure proceedings if I can't catch up on the commercial property loan for this building.

Character 1: You're losing the building?

Character 2: [bitter] Three missed payments already, and every empty unit makes it worse—can't lower rents because I need every dollar for the mortgage, but can't keep tenants because the rents are too high.

Character 1: [desperately] There must be programs, refinancing options, something—I literally have the resource guides in my car, contact numbers for housing preservation specialists who might be able to help.

Character 2: [laughs grimly] Already tried. [exhales]

Character 1: [softer] My supervisor says they're bringing us back to full hours next quarter, but that doesn't help either of us right now, does it?

Character 2: Next quarter. [long pause]

Character 1: [pleading] I've never missed a payment in four years living here, not once, even when my daughter needed surgery and the insurance wouldn't cover the anesthesiologist.

Character 2: I know you haven't.

Character 1: [voice breaking] If you evict me, I lose my job—they have a policy about employees maintaining stable housing, especially those of us who work with vulnerable populations.

Character 2: [exhausted] And if I don't collect rent, I lose everything my father built over thirty years, but what's the point of collecting from people who don't have it?

Character 1: [barely audible] We're both drowning in the same system I'm supposed to be helping people navigate. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: You can stay through the end of next month, but after that, we'll both probably be looking for new places anyway. [hollow]

Character 1: Maybe I can help you fill out applications for emergency assistance—God knows I've processed enough of them to know which answers get approved. [weak laugh]

Character 2: [faintly amused] A Medicaid worker helping a landlord apply for benefits—there's something beautifully broken about that, isn't there? [sighs]
