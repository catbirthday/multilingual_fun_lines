Scenario: An optometrist discovers their new patient, a dilettante who dabbles in various hobbies, has been attempting dangerous DIY laser eye procedures after watching YouTube tutorials.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [firmly] These corneal abrasions aren't from normal wear and tear—they're laser burns, and I need you to tell me exactly what you've been doing to your eyes.

Character 2: [defensive] Look, I've been researching vision correction techniques online for months, reading all the medical journals and watching procedures, so it's not like I went in completely blind.

Character 1: [incredulous] You're telling me you attempted to perform laser eye surgery on yourself based on YouTube videos and medical journals you found online?

Character 2: Not surgery exactly, more like controlled light therapy using a modified DVD burner and some specialized lenses I ordered from China. [nervous laugh]

Character 1: [measured] The damage to your left eye shows at least three separate burn patterns at different depths, which means you did this multiple times even after experiencing pain and vision problems.

Character 2: [quietly defensive] The first attempt actually improved my vision for about two days before things got blurry, so I thought I just needed to adjust the focal length and intensity settings.

Character 1: You've permanently scarred your cornea in ways that might require actual surgery to repair, assuming we can even salvage full vision at this point. [exhales]

Character 2: [insecure] I've successfully taught myself woodworking, basic plumbing, and even some electrical work from online tutorials—this shouldn't have been that different.

Character 1: [guiding tone] The human eye isn't a home improvement project; it's one of the most complex and delicate organs in your body with zero margin for error.

Character 2: The professional lasik consultations were quoting me eight thousand dollars for both eyes, and the procedure itself only takes fifteen minutes. [trailing off]

Character 1: [patiently] That fifteen minutes represents decades of medical training, millions of dollars in precision equipment, and safeguards you can't replicate in your garage.

Character 2: My setup cost less than three hundred dollars total, and I spent weeks calibrating everything using pig eyes from the butcher shop for practice runs.

Character 1: [horrified] Pig eyes?

Character 2: [defensively fast] They have similar optical properties to human eyes according to the veterinary journals I read, and I got pretty consistent results after the first dozen attempts.

Character 1: [stern] I'm prescribing antibiotic drops and scheduling you for emergency consultation with a corneal specialist tomorrow morning at eight sharp.

Character 2: [hesitant] Will they be able to fix this, or am I looking at permanent damage from my experimenting?

Character 1: [carefully] The scarring is significant but not necessarily irreversible if we act quickly and you follow every single instruction without deviation or improvisation.

Character 2: [sheepishly] I actually have a follow-up question about whether vitamin A megadoses might accelerate corneal healing, because I found this study from 1987 that suggested—

Character 1: Stop. No more self-treatment, no more research, no more experiments. Your dabbling phase with your eyes ends today.

Character 2: [quietly resigned] I suppose you're going to report this to some medical board or insurance company, which means my premiums will skyrocket. [bitter sigh]
