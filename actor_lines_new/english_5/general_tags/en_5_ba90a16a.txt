=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [gasping] Oh my God!

Character 2: [weakly] Don't scream, please. I know this looks bad but I promise I'm not here to hurt you or your animals. [labored breathing]

Character 1: You're bleeding everywhere, there's so much blood on the snow, and you're—you're definitely not a regular wolf, are you? Those eyes are too human.

Character 2: [grimly] The hunters got me with silver shot about two miles north, and before you ask, yes, that's as bad as the stories say it is. [groans]

Character 1: [determined] Listen, I don't care what you are right now, you're hurt and there's a blizzard coming in. Can you walk if I help you to the barn?

Character 2: Why would you—

Character 1: [gently firm] Because I've been rehabilitating injured wildlife for fifteen years and I'm not about to stop now just because you might be, [exhales], something impossible.

Character 2: [struggling] Your goats, the ones that went missing last month? That was a mountain lion. I've been keeping it away from your property ever since. [coughs wetly]

Character 1: [stunned] You've been protecting my homestead? For how long? And why would you do that when you don't even know me?

Character 2: [exhausted whisper] Six winters now. You leave food out for the feral cats even when you can barely afford groceries, and you nursed that orphaned bear cub last spring when anyone else would've called Fish and Game.

Character 1: [voice cracking] That still doesn't explain why you'd risk silver bullets from hunters just to guard some crazy person living alone in the woods with too many rescue animals.

Character 2: [painfully sincere] Because you're the first human I've encountered in decades who treats every living thing with genuine kindness, even the creatures everyone else fears or forgets about.

Character 1: Well, right now you're the creature that needs help, so we're getting you inside before you bleed out in my yard. [determined] Can you shift to human form, or is that too painful?

Character 2: The silver makes it impossible to change until it's removed, and, [sharp inhale], I can't reach the wounds on my back to dig the shot out myself.

Character 1: [steadying breath] Okay, I've extracted buckshot from deer before, and I have veterinary forceps in my kit. This is going to hurt like hell, but I can do it.

Character 2: [wearily grateful] You'd trust a monster enough to turn your back on it with surgical tools? Most humans would've called the authorities or grabbed a gun by now.

Character 1: [warmly resolute] You've been watching me for six years, so you already know I don't believe in monsters, just misunderstood creatures trying to survive in a world that doesn't want them.

Character 2: [fading] I'm going to pass out soon from the blood loss, but when I wake up, [struggling], I need to warn you about the hunters.

Character 1: [urgently] No, stay conscious just a little longer! What about the hunters? Are they tracking you here? [frightened] How much time do we have?

Character 2: [barely conscious] They'll come at dawn, following the blood trail, thinking they're hunting a rabid wolf that's been stalking livestock. [weakly] They don't know what I really am, but they'll shoot first regardless.
