=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [distracted] Look, I don't have time for collection calls right now, I'm in the middle of evaluating a healthcare portfolio worth more than your entire company.

Character 2: [professionally distant] I understand you're busy, Mr. Chen, but your mother's account has been delinquent for six months and we need to discuss payment options before it goes to collections. [pause]

Character 1: [irritated] My mother's bills are on autopay through my assistant, so there's obviously been some error on your end that—wait, how did you just pronounce my name?

Character 2: [quietly] The same way I've always pronounced it, Michael, though I guess you probably go by Mike in those boardrooms now, don't you?

Character 1: [stunned] Sarah? Sarah Martinez? [exhales] Jesus Christ, is this really you calling me about medical bills after fifteen years of nothing?

Character 2: [gently resigned] It's just my job, Mike, I call hundreds of people every week about overdue accounts, and today your mother's name came up in my queue.

Character 1: [deflating] I can't believe you're working at General Memorial, the same hospital where we used to volunteer in high school, talking about changing the world together.

Character 2: Well, one of us did change the world, or at least the venture capital part of it, while the other one stayed here helping people figure out how to pay for their surgeries. [soft sigh]

Character 1: [quietly] I'm sorry.

Character 2: For what exactly?

Character 1: [vulnerable] For disappearing after that first IPO, for acting like our whole neighborhood was something to escape from instead of something that made me who I am.

Character 2: [measured kindness] You did what you thought you had to do, and honestly, watching you on Bloomberg last month talking about your latest acquisition, you looked exactly like who you always wanted to be.

Character 1: [hollow laugh] Funny thing is, I haven't felt like myself in years, just this character I play who evaluates everything in terms of ROI and market potential.

Character 2: [warmly] Your mom talks about you all the time when she comes in for her treatments, shows me articles about your deals, still proud even though you barely visit anymore.

Character 1: [breaking slightly] She never told me she was sick, and apparently her insurance lapsed because I fired the assistant who was handling her accounts three months ago. [exhales heavily]

Character 2: [empathetic] She didn't want to burden you with it, said you had enough pressure already, but Mike, she really needs you right now, not your money, just you.

Character 1: God, I've been such an ass, measuring my worth in portfolio performance while my mother's been going through chemo alone, too proud to ask her successful son for help.

Character 2: [gently firm] You can fix this, not just the bills but the distance, and if you want, I can help you navigate the treatment schedules and insurance appeals.

Character 1: [surrendering completely] I'll be there tomorrow morning, and Sarah, would you maybe grab coffee with me after, so I can properly apologize for the last fifteen years?

Character 2: [soft smile in voice] Coffee sounds good, Mike, and for what it's worth, that scared kid from the neighborhood is still in there somewhere, I can hear him right now.
