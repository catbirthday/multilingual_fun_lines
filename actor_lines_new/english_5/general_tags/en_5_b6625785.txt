Scenario: A substation technician is called to investigate a power outage at their estranged sibling's neighborhood, discovering they're the one who made the emergency call.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [surprised] So you're the one who called in the emergency outage report from Maple Street—I didn't realize you still lived in Mom's old house after all these years.

Character 2: Well, someone had to keep it from falling apart completely, unlike certain people who disappeared the moment things got difficult with her care. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: The transformer feeding your block is showing serious degradation, probably been failing slowly for months now, which explains the flickering you mentioned. [pause]

Character 2: [dismissive] Always hiding behind the technical stuff, aren't you? Even now you can't just have a normal conversation about why you haven't returned a single call in three years.

Character 1: [defensive] Look, I'm here to fix your power situation, not rehash ancient history about who did or didn't show up when Mom needed dialysis appointments every other day.

Character 2: Ancient history? She died eighteen months ago, Marcus, and you couldn't even make it to the funeral because of some supposed emergency at the substation.

Character 1: [quietly] That emergency was real—half the hospital district lost power that morning, including the cardiac wing where they were doing open-heart surgeries.

Character 2: Sure, and I suppose every holiday, birthday, and Sunday dinner for the past decade had similar life-or-death situations preventing you from showing up. [exhales]

Character 1: You think I wanted to be the one who left? You think it was easy watching you become her perfect caregiver while I became the family disappointment? [voice breaking]

Character 2: [softer] Perfect caregiver? I was drowning, Marcus, absolutely drowning, and every time I called begging for just a weekend off, you had another excuse.

Character 1: I sent money every month, made sure the mortgage stayed current, paid for the nurse when insurance wouldn't cover it—that had to count for something.

Character 2: [tired] Money isn't the same as being there to hold her hand when she was scared, or listening to her tell the same stories about Dad for the hundredth time. [sighs]

Character 1: [barely audible] I know.

Character 2: She kept asking for you near the end, kept thinking you were just running late from work, and I had to keep making excuses about traffic on the interstate.

Character 1: [struggling] The thing is, I knew if I came back, if I saw her like that, I'd never be able to leave again, and I was terrified of that.

Character 2: [weary] And here we are, both stuck in this house anyway—you fixing the power, me living with her ghost in every corner of every room. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: [resigned] Yeah, I guess so.

Character 2: The transformer isn't the only thing that's been slowly failing around here, but at least that's something you actually know how to fix.

Character 1: [firmly] I'll need to schedule a full replacement next week, and I'll handle the paperwork myself to expedite it—it's the least I can do at this point.

Character 2: The least you can do.
