    "conversation": [
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[shocked] Jamie? Oh my God, I didn't— [pause] I had no idea you worked here, they just told me to meet with the equipment tech about the new monitoring devices for our participants."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[coldly] Yeah well, surprise. [bitter] I've been here three years now, fixing all the machines that keep people breathing while they detox from whatever they've been shooting up."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[hesitantly] Look, I know this is, um, incredibly awkward but we need to be professional here. [quietly] These ankle monitors are for people trying to rebuild their lives, and I really need them calibrated properly by tomorrow."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[sarcastically] Oh right, you're the big savior now, helping all the addicts get their lives together. [harshly] Where was all that compassion when Dad was drinking himself to death in our living room?"},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[defensively] That's not fair and you know it! I was seventeen, what was I supposed to do? [frustrated] At least I'm trying to help people now instead of just, I don't know, hiding in a basement fixing machines."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[laughs bitterly] Hiding? That's rich. [accusingly] You literally changed your last name so nobody would connect you to our junkie mother or our drunk father when you got this fancy coordinator job."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[voice breaking] I changed it because I couldn't [sighs] I couldn't walk into courtrooms and have defense attorneys Google our family and use it against my participants, okay? [quietly] Every overdose story they'd find about Mom would undermine everything I'm trying to build here."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[mockingly] Well at least you got to go to college and build something. [angrily] Some of us had to drop out and work three jobs to pay for Dad's medical bills after his liver gave out, remember?"},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[apologetically] Jamie, I— I tried to help with the bills, you wouldn't let me. [desperately] You sent every check back unopened, what was I supposed to do, force you to take my money?"},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[quietly] I didn't want your pity money. [exhales] I wanted my sibling to actually show up, not just throw cash at the problem from across the country."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[empathetically] You're right, I should have come home. [regretfully] But being there, in that house, with all those memories of finding Mom on the bathroom floor, I just— I couldn't breathe there anymore."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[bitterly] Yeah well, someone had to clean up those bathroom floors. [quieter] Someone had to identify her body at the morgue while you were at your freshman orientation."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[crying while speaking] I know, okay? I know I left you with everything. [shaky voice] That's why I do this job, trying to save other families from going through what we did."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[sarcastically] How noble of you. [sighs] Meanwhile I'm here making sure the ventilators don't fail when someone's kid is going through withdrawal seizures."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[desperately] We're both trying to help people, Jamie, just in different ways. [pause] Maybe we're both still trying to save Mom and Dad, even though it's too late."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": Maybe. [long pause] The ankle monitors are in the storage room, I'll have them ready by tomorrow morning."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[hopefully] Thank you. [hesitantly] Look, there's a coffee shop around the corner, maybe after you're done with your shift we could, um, I don't know, actually talk for once?"},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[skeptically] I get off at six. [quietly] But I'm not promising anything beyond coffee, and you're buying since apparently you can afford to send checks across the country."},
        {"role": "Character 1", "content": "[relieved] Six works. [warmly] And Jamie? It's really good to see you, even if, you know, this isn't how I imagined it happening after seven years."},
        {"role": "Character 2", "content": "[softly] Yeah, well, life's funny that way. [clearing throat] Now let me show you these monitors before we both start crying in the equipment room and really make this awkward."}
