=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Wait, who are you? I didn't see you come in.

Character 2: Just someone passing through. You seemed deep in thought about that equation on your screen—it's a fascinating approach to quantum entanglement, by the way.

Character 1: How did you even see my screen from over there?

Character 2: Good eyesight and pattern recognition. The way you're structuring those variables suggests you're trying to solve for non-local correlations, right? Most people would use Bell's theorem as a starting point.

Character 1: That's... exactly what I'm working on. Are you a physicist?

Character 2: Not exactly. I pick things up here and there. Your methodology is unconventional but it might actually work better than the standard approach for what you're trying to prove.

Character 1: You can't just "pick up" quantum mechanics. Who sent you?

Character 2: Nobody sent me. Sometimes people just share interests. Though I admit quantum mechanics isn't typical coffee shop conversation material.

Character 1: This is classified research. You shouldn't even know what you're looking at.

Character 2: [furious] Classified? You're working on this in a public café with your screen facing the window! If it's so secret, maybe exercise some basic operational security instead of blaming random strangers.

Character 1: I... okay, fair point. But you still haven't explained who you are.

Character 2: Someone who recognizes innovative thinking when they see it. Your approach to the measurement problem is genuinely novel—you're treating observer effect as a variable rather than a constant.

Character 1: How could you possibly deduce that from a glimpse at my screen?

Character 2: The same way you can tell a song from three notes if you know music. Pattern recognition is pattern recognition, whether it's physics or anything else.

Character 1: Are you going to report this to someone?

Character 2: [very sincerely] Report what? That someone is advancing human understanding of quantum mechanics? I'd rather see where your research leads. Knowledge should be celebrated, not suppressed.

Character 1: [very slowly] So you're just... a random genius who happened to walk by?

Character 2: Genius is overstating it. Curious and observant, maybe. Your work is the impressive thing here—I'm just someone who can appreciate what you're accomplishing.

Character 1: This is the strangest conversation I've ever had.

Character 2: [sleepily] Strange conversations often lead to the best breakthroughs. Keep working on that equation—you're closer to the solution than you think. The third variable needs inverting, by the way.
