            "content": "Guessing implies randomness, but your color choices show clear intentionality. Look at this piece here—the way you've used complementary oranges and blues to create visual tension. That's not accidental, that's understanding."

            "content": "[clearing throat] Actually, I'm being honest because that's what you need to hear. Your self-doubt is becoming a bigger obstacle than any technical limitation. The work speaks for itself—it's strong, evolving, and increasingly confident even if you aren't."
