=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You seriously think we should be editing human genes? That's playing God, straight up.

Character 2: I mean, I get why it feels that way, but um, we already intervene medically all the time. Insulin for diabetics, heart transplants—those used to be called "playing God" too, you know?

Character 1: Those save existing lives. Designer babies are completely different.

Character 2: [very melancholic] Yeah, you're... you're absolutely right that there's a distinction there. I guess I've been thinking about families with Huntington's disease who just want their kids to not suffer, and it's, uh, it's really hard to tell them no.

Character 1: So where does it end? Intelligence enhancement? Height? Eye color?

Character 2: Mmm, that's the slippery slope everyone worries about and honestly, I don't have a perfect answer. Maybe we start with just preventing severe diseases and, like, see how society handles that first?

Character 1: "See how society handles it?" That's your ethical framework?

Character 2: No, no, you're right, that sounds terrible. What I meant was, um, we need really strict guidelines, international oversight, maybe only allowing changes that prevent suffering rather than enhance capabilities. I'm still figuring this out myself.

Character 1: But who decides what counts as suffering? Deafness? Autism? Being short?

Character 2: Oof. Yeah, that's... that's where I start questioning everything I thought I knew. The deaf community has taught us that deafness isn't necessarily suffering, it's just different. Maybe I've been thinking about this all wrong.

Character 1: Finally, some honesty. You biotech people always act like you have all the answers.

Character 2: That's fair, I probably came across as, uhh, overly confident at first. Truth is, these questions keep me up at night sometimes—like, what if we're the generation that fundamentally breaks humanity trying to fix it?

Character 1: Exactly! And once we start, we can't undo it. It's permanent.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Actually, can I... can I share something? My nephew has cystic fibrosis and watching him struggle to breathe, it's, um, it makes all these philosophical debates feel really abstract compared to his actual pain.

Character 1: I'm sorry about your nephew, but personal stories don't change the ethics here.

Character 2: You're right, they don't. But they do remind me that, erm, real people are suffering while we debate, and maybe that means we need to find some middle ground instead of just saying no to everything.

Character 1: Middle ground on eugenics? Really?

Character 2: [whispering loudly] No, God no, that's not what I meant at all. I'm talking about therapeutic interventions only, with community input, especially from disabled communities who actually understand what we're discussing. I'm really not explaining this well, am I?

Character 1: [upset] You're not! Every time you backtrack it sounds like you're just trying to find a nicer way to justify the same thing!

Character 2: Hmm. Maybe you're right and I am just, like, dressing up my biases in different words. I think I need to actually listen more to people who oppose this entirely, because clearly I'm missing something fundamental about why this feels so wrong to you.
