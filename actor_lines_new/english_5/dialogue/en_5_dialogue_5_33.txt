=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [apologetic] I know it's late but, um, I need to switch my lineup around. Is that still possible?

Character 2: [stern] Look, the Thursday night game starts in forty minutes. You've had all week to set this up, and now you're telling me you want to, what, completely reorganize your roster?

Character 1: Just my flex position and maybe, uh, maybe the defense?

Character 2: Jeez, okay, so you're basically asking me to override the system locks right before kickoff. The league voted on these deadlines for a reason—people were constantly making last-minute changes based on, I don't know, insider injury reports or whatever.

Character 1: My running back just got ruled out. Like, literally five minutes ago.

Character 2: [joking] Oh wow, let me guess—you had Henderson starting didn't you? Man, that guy's hamstrings are made of tissue paper apparently. I mean, this is what, his third injury this season?

Character 1: Fourth actually. So can you help me or not?

Character 2: Right right.

Character 1: Is that a yes? Because I'm, um, I'm kind of desperate here.

Character 2: Honestly, I can unlock it but everyone's gonna know I did it. The system logs every administrative override and, uh, people are already pretty annoyed about the whole trade veto thing from last week, so this might not go over well.

Character 1: [stern] I didn't complain when you changed your lineup after the Monday deadline in week three.

Character 2: Ooh, that's... that's different though. My entire team was on bye week and I literally forgot to set anything—yours is just bad luck with an injury report that, honestly, everyone kind of saw coming with Henderson's history.

Character 1: Come on, I'm in fourth place. I need this win.

Character 2: Dang, alright, um, here's what I can do. I'll unlock it for exactly five minutes, you make your changes, and then we never speak of this again. But you owe me when playoff seeding comes around, understood?

Character 1: Yes! Thank you! Who should I put in for Henderson?

Character 2: [clearing throat] Well, looking at your bench... mmm, you've got Pierce who's playing the Texans' terrible run defense, or Williams who, uh, might get more touches with their passing game coordinator out sick this week.

Character 1: Pierce hasn't done anything in three weeks though.

Character 2: Yeah but that's mostly because they were facing top-five run defenses. This week is completely different—the matchup is, like, almost too good to pass up, and his snap count has been steadily increasing which usually means the coaching staff trusts him more.

Character 1: Okay okay, Pierce it is. And, uh, what about my defense?

Character 2: Err, honestly? Keep what you have. The Steelers are playing a backup quarterback making his first start, so even though they're not a sexy pick, they're probably gonna get you at least two turnovers and maybe a defensive touchdown.
