=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Wait, you're seriously wearing a Bloomberg Terminal ring to our engagement party?

Character 2: Oh come on, it's not a Bloomberg ring! It's just, uh, engraved with EUR/USD because that's the pair where we first made our fortune together, remember? I thought it was romantic in a... admittedly weird, trader kind of way.

Character 1: You had our wedding bands engraved with a currency pair?

Character 2: Well, yeah, I mean, it's more meaningful than some random date, right? That trade on the European Central Bank announcement literally changed our lives—we went from broke analysts to, you know, actually being able to afford this whole thing.

Character 1: What does mine say?

Character 2: [deep pitch] Yours has GBP/JPY with the coordinates of the London Metal Exchange, because, um, that's where you absolutely crushed it during the Brexit volatility. I thought you'd appreciate the... the symbolism or whatever.

Character 1: You're joking. Please tell me you're joking.

Character 2: Look, I know it sounds ridiculous but hear me out—these aren't just random forex pairs, they're like, our story! That night we stayed up watching the Fed announcement, eating terrible Chinese food while the dollar went crazy?

Character 1: Other couples have "forever" or their wedding date!

Character 2: [very loudly] But we're not other couples! We met at that Deutsche Bank conference arguing about carry trades! Our first date was literally analyzing the Bank of Japan's intervention strategy over sushi!

Character 1: My mother is going to ask what the numbers mean.

Character 2: Ah, well, we can just tell her it's... coordinates? Or, uh, maybe just say it's a special code between us—which honestly it kind of is, when you think about it.

Character 1: And the MetaTrader 4 logo on the inside?

Character 2: Okay that was maybe a bit much, I'll admit. But come on, MT4 is where we placed our first trades together! It's actually pretty sweet if you—if you really think about the meaning behind it.

Character 1: [angry] You literally romanticized spread betting!

Character 2: [high-pitched] Hey, some people have songs, we have the Swiss franc decoupling! That Black Thursday crash where we both somehow called it perfectly? That's, like, our miracle moment!

Character 1: Did you at least get them from a normal jeweler?

Character 2: Actually, umm, funny story—I got them from this guy in Singapore who usually makes cufflinks for Goldman Sachs executives. He thought I was completely insane, but, you know, he did beautiful work with the engravings.

Character 1: [curious] Wait, is that why you were asking about my Oanda account password last month?

Character 2: Yeah, I needed to check the exact pip count from our first profitable trade together—1,247 pips on AUD/USD during that Reserve Bank of Australia surprise cut. See? I mean, that's romance! Sort of. In a really, really niche way.
