Each one has this incredible story, and I mean, your phone probably takes better pictures than most of these, but there's something about the, uh, the history, you know?"

The thing is, collecting isn't really about money—it's more about, mmm, finding what speaks to you and just slowly building from there, one little piece at a time."

But you know what? Still works perfectly, and now it has character, so I guess what I'm saying is don't let fear stop you from enjoying beautiful things."

You just need to, er, educate yourself a bit—read some forums, watch YouTube videos, maybe visit a few antique shops just to get a feel for things, and before you know it, you'll be spotting treasures everywhere."

I get so emotional about this because collecting saved me during a really dark time, and I think everyone deserves to find that one thing that brings them joy, you know? You don't need to be good at research, you just need to love something."

It was actually my grandfather's old Brownie camera—he left it to me and I had no idea what to do with it, but then I started learning about it and, well, fifteen years and about sixty cameras later, here we are! The funny thing is, uhh, he probably bought it for like two dollars back in the day."

            "content": "Mmm, I hear you, and honestly that guilt is something I've worked through too. But here's the thing—these cameras were sitting in dusty shops going unloved, and now they're preserved and appreciated every single day. It's not hoarding if you're actually, like, caring for history and sharing the joy with others, right?"

            "content": "Oh absolutely! Well, okay, most of them—there's a few that need repairs I haven't gotten to yet. But I rotate through them and, uh, each one teaches you something different about photography, about craftsmanship, about how people used to see the world, which is pretty incredible when you think about it."

            "content": "And that's beautiful too! Really, I mean it—the best camera is the one you have with you, and you're actually documenting your life while some collectors, er, get so caught up in the equipment they forget to actually take pictures. Your phone photos probably mean more than half my collection, honestly."

Your phone photos of your family or your travels or just, like, random moments that made you smile—those are irreplaceable, while I could rebuy most of these cameras if I had to, so really, we're both collectors in our own way."
