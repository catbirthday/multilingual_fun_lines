Subject: Your overdose prevention work saving lives while losing your own brother to addiction

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [exhausted] Three overdoses reversed this week. Three people who get to go home, get another chance. And I keep thinking about how I knew every sign with Danny. Every single one. [bitter] The pinpoint pupils, the nodding off at dinner, the excuses that got more and more creative. I work in harm reduction, for Christ's sake. I literally teach people how to spot this stuff. [pause] But with him it was—I don't know, it was different. He was my little brother, not some client. [very sad] I gave him Narcan to carry. Multiple doses. Found them all in his apartment after, still in the packaging. [sigh] The worst part is when someone comes up to me at the clinic, tells me I saved their life, and I just... I smile and nod because what am I supposed to say? That I couldn't save the one person who actually— [crying while speaking] who actually mattered most? [pause] No, that's not fair. They all matter. That's the point. [warm] Every person we pull back, every kit we distribute, it's someone's Danny. [very quietly] I just wish mine had let me help him the way I help strangers every day. Maybe that's, um... maybe that's why I keep doing this. [shaky voice] Because somebody's brother is still alive tonight, even if mine isn't.
