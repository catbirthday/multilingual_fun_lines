And I know you probably deal with hundreds of people every day, but... hmm, how do I even explain this? [warm] You were just so genuinely cheerful, you know? Not like, fake customer service cheerful, but actually happy. And when you asked how my day was going, I almost—I almost actually told you. [chuckle softly] Which is crazy because I never do that with strangers. But something about the way you, er... the way you just radiated this positive energy? It made me forget for a minute that I'd been crying in my car twenty minutes earlier. [emotional] God, I needed that so badly today. Someone who wasn't trying to fix anything or give advice, just... being kind. [pause] So yeah, I'm leaving this note because, um, because I want you to know that your smile, your little jokes about the weather, the way you carefully packed my groceries—it mattered. [happy] It really, really mattered. You turned my whole day around without even knowing it. Thank you for being, I don't know, a bright spot when everything felt so dark."
