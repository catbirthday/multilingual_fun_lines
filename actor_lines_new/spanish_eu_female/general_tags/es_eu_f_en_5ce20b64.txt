=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Professor Hartley, I, um, I brought the manuscript you asked to see—the one about the Henderson case we worked on together, though I'm not sure why you wanted it now after all these years.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, yes, the Henderson case, our great triumph of historical detective work, except, well, there's something I need to tell you about that, something I've been, [exhales heavily], carrying for thirty-seven years now.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What do you mean?

Character 2 [en]: You remember how we couldn't find the prosecution's missing witness testimony from 1963, the one that would've proven Henderson was targeted for his activism? I, uh, I actually found it in 1987, tucked inside another case file.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Wait, you found it? But we published three papers arguing that testimony was deliberately destroyed, that its absence proved systematic suppression of evidence—I mean, that became the foundation of my entire dissertation.

Character 2 [en]: I know, God, I know, and I've watched you build your career on that work, but the actual testimony, it, mmm, it showed Henderson was guilty of the assault charge. [voice breaking] Not the civil rights martyr we thought.

Character 1 [en]: You're telling me that everything we wrote about prosecutorial misconduct, about the silencing of Black activists through false charges, that was all based on evidence you knew existed but chose to hide?

Character 2 [en]: [weakly] The movement needed heroes, needed proof of what we all knew was happening systematically, and one flawed man's actual guilt didn't change the larger truth about Jim Crow justice, or at least that's what I told myself.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly seething] You let me stand in front of academic conferences, in courtrooms as an expert witness, citing research you knew was fundamentally compromised, and you just, what, watched me make a fool of myself for decades?

Character 2 [en]: You were never a fool, you were brilliant, passionate, everything I'd hoped to be before I got, er, caught up in the politics of it all. [coughs] I thought protecting the narrative mattered more than one inconvenient document.

Character 1 [en]: Where is it now, this testimony you've been concealing? Please tell me you didn't destroy it after letting me build my life's work on a lie. [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [wheezing slightly] It's in my office at home, bottom drawer of the filing cabinet, behind the tax returns from 1987—I couldn't bring myself to destroy it but I couldn't, ah, couldn't face what revealing it would mean either.

Character 1 [en]: [struggling] I defended you when Professor Chen accused you of selective scholarship, when the review board questioned our methodology—I said you were the most ethical historian I knew, that your commitment to truth was absolute.

Character 2 [en]: [remorseful whisper] I loved you like my own daughter, watched you surpass everything I'd accomplished, and maybe that's why I couldn't bear to be the one to take it all away from you, though I see now that was just cowardice dressed up as kindness.

Character 1 [en]: [voice shaking] The Henderson case is being reopened next month for the fiftieth anniversary review, they're using my research as the centerpiece for a documentary about miscarriages of justice, and now you're telling me it's all built on your lie?

Character 2 [en]: [fading] That's why I had to tell you now while there's still, um, still time for you to decide what to do with the truth—it's your burden now, not mine. [labored breathing] I'm sorry I made you carry it.

Character 1 [en]: You taught me that history demands courage, that we owe the dead our honesty even when it's uncomfortable, and yet you've been sitting on evidence that would've changed everything we understood about that case.

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] I taught you what I wished I could be, not what I was—maybe that's the best any mentor can do, show their students the path they were too weak to walk themselves.

Character 1 [en]: I don't know whether to thank you for finally telling me or hate you for waiting until you're beyond consequences to confess, when I'm the one who'll have to live with whatever I decide. [choking up]

Character 2 [en]: Hate me if you need to, but please, remember that the work you've done since then, the cases you've illuminated, the truths you've uncovered—those stand on their own merit, not on the Henderson lie. [final exhale] You became the historian I pretended to be.
