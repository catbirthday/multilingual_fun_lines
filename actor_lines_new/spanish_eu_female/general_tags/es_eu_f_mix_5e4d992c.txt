=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [sardonic] Well, well, look who's staring at that email for the third time today—7 millones de euros son muchos ceros para, em, simplemente ignorar, ¿no te parece?

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] It's blood money and you know it. Esta gente, no solo roba datos, están destruyendo vidas con ataques de ransomware a hospitales, y yo, eh, no puedo ser parte de eso.

Character 3 [mix]: Oh please, spare me the noble hero routine—llevas 6 meses comiendo fideos instantáneos mientras estas corporaciones gigantes que proteges ganan miles de millones, ¿y ahora de repente la ética importa más que, qué, vivir cómodamente por una vez?

Character 2 [mix]: Living comfortably? ¿Así lo llamarías cuando tendría que, tipo, mirar constantemente por encima del hombro, preguntándome cuándo vendrá el CNI a llamar a mi puerta? [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: [whisper-laughing] The FBI? Esos inútiles no podrían cogerte ni aunque les dejaras migas de pan hechas de, mmm, carteles de neón diciendo 'aquí cometí delitos.'

Character 2 [mix]: [measured] You're getting desperate, aren't you? Quiero decir, los insultos, el regateo—es porque sabes que una vez que borre este email, se acabó, terminamos esta conversación para siempre.

Character 1 [mix]: Forever's a strong word for someone who's been refreshing their bank account every hour, viendo ese saldo patético burlándose de ti mientras tus habilidades podrían, eh, literalmente convertirte en realeza en ciertos círculos.

Character 2 [mix]: Royalty? [snorts] Más bien una prisionera bien pagada.

Character 1 [mix]: [silky] Such drama.

Character 2 [mix]: [steadying breath] Look, I've spent five years building a reputation as someone companies can trust, sabes, para encontrar sus vulnerabilidades antes que los malos—eso realmente significa algo para mí.

Character 1 [mix]: [gleefully] Oh, reputation! Sí, hablemos de esa moneda invisible que no paga el alquiler ni compra comida ni, mmm, financia los tratamientos de cáncer de tu madre. [darker] ¿Cómo va ese crowdfunding, por cierto?

Character 2 [mix]: Don't you dare bring her into this—eso es exactamente el tipo de manipulación que demuestra que estoy tomando la decisión correcta aquí. [voice shaking slightly]

Character 1 [mix]: Manipulation implies I'm lying, pero ambas sabemos que cada palabra es verdad, y esos 7 millones podrían resolver todos los problemas que has tenido, más problemas que ni siquiera has, eh, imaginado todavía.

Character 2 [mix]: [hollow laugh] Every problem except the one where I'd have to live with myself afterward, sabiendo que ayudé a criminales a mantener ciudades enteras como rehenes por bitcoin.

Character 1 [mix]: Cities, schmities—they have insurance! Nadie sufre realmente excepto corporaciones sin rostro que han estado desangrando a la gente durante décadas de todos modos. Básicamente serías, mmm, Robin Hood con mejor Wi-Fi.

Character 2 [mix]: [exhales] Robin Hood didn't encrypt emergency room databases.

Character 1 [mix]: [mockingly sweet] No, he just shot people with actual arrows, lo cual parece, eh, significativamente más violento que teclear en un ordenador, pero vale, finjamos que tu superioridad moral tiene sentido.

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly firm] I'm deleting the email now. Lo que seas—culpa, tentación, alucinación por estrés—hemos terminado aquí, y voy a volver a mis fideos y mi conciencia limpia.

Character 1 [mix]: Clean conscience won't keep you warm when they shut off your heat in January, pero oye, al menos tendrás tus principios para, em, abrazarlos mientras te congelas.

Character 2 [mix]: [resolved] Better cold and free than warm in a cage I built myself. [clicks decisively] Ya está. Borrado. ¿Y sabes qué? Ya me siento más calentita. Adiós.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [sardonic] Well, well, look who's staring at that email for the third time today—seven million dollars is a lot of zeros to, um, just ignore, isn't it?

Character 2: [firmly] It's blood money and you know it. These people, they're not just stealing data, they're destroying lives with ransomware attacks on hospitals, and I, uh, I can't be part of that.

Character 3: Oh please, spare me the noble hero routine—you've been eating ramen for six months while these corporate giants you protect make billions, and now suddenly ethics matter more than, what, actually living comfortably for once?

Character 2: Living comfortably? Is that what you'd call it when I'd have to, like, constantly look over my shoulder, wondering when the FBI will come knocking? [bitter laugh]

Character 1: [whisper-laughing] The FBI? Those bumbling idiots couldn't catch you if you left them breadcrumbs made of, mmm, neon signs saying 'I did crimes here.'

Character 2: [measured] You're getting desperate, aren't you? I mean, the insults, the bargaining—it's because you know once I delete this email, that's it, we're done having this conversation forever.

Character 1: Forever's a strong word for someone who's been refreshing their bank account every hour, watching that pathetic balance mock you while your skills could, uh, literally make you royalty in certain circles.

Character 2: Royalty? [snorts] More like a well-paid prisoner.

Character 1: [silky] Such drama.

Character 2: [steadying breath] Look, I've spent five years building a reputation as someone companies can trust to, you know, find their vulnerabilities before the bad guys do—that actually means something to me.

Character 1: [gleefully] Oh, reputation! Yes, let's talk about that invisible currency that doesn't pay rent or buy groceries or, hmm, fund your mother's cancer treatments. [darker] How's that GoFundMe doing, by the way?

Character 2: Don't you dare bring her into this—that's exactly the kind of manipulation that proves I'm making the right choice here. [voice shaking slightly]

Character 1: Manipulation implies I'm lying, but we both know every word is true, and that seven million could solve every problem you've ever had, plus problems you haven't even, uh, imagined yet.

Character 2: [hollow laugh] Every problem except the one where I'd have to live with myself afterward, knowing I helped criminals hold entire cities hostage for bitcoin.

Character 1: Cities, schmities—they have insurance! Nobody actually suffers except faceless corporations who've been bleeding people dry for decades anyway. You'd basically be, mmm, Robin Hood with better Wi-Fi.

Character 2: [exhales] Robin Hood didn't encrypt emergency room databases.

Character 1: [mockingly sweet] No, he just shot people with actual arrows, which seems, er, significantly more violent than typing on a keyboard, but sure, let's pretend your moral high ground makes sense.

Character 2: [quietly firm] I'm deleting the email now. Whatever you are—guilt, temptation, stress-induced hallucination—we're done here, and I'm going back to my ramen and my clean conscience.

Character 1: Clean conscience won't keep you warm when they shut off your heat in January, but hey, at least you'll have your principles to, um, cuddle with while you freeze.

Character 2: [resolved] Better cold and free than warm in a cage I built myself. [clicks decisively] There. Deleted. And you know what? I already feel warmer. Goodbye.
