Scenario: A flatmate discovers their ironworker roommate has been secretly using their shared apartment to store stolen construction materials worth thousands of dollars.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: I need to ask you something about the storage unit in the basement, the one you said was for your tools. [pause] There's copper piping in there with construction site tags still attached.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Those are leftovers from legitimate jobs, material that would've been thrown out anyway. The foreman knows I take scrap sometimes.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly firm] Scrap doesn't come wrapped in manufacturer's plastic with next week's delivery dates printed on the labels, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: [bristling] You went through my stuff? That's a locked unit, you had no right to go snooping around down there!

Character 1 [en]: The landlord asked me to check for a water leak, gave me the master key. [exhales] I wasn't snooping, but now I wish I hadn't seen any of it.

Character 2 [en]: Look, you don't understand how this industry works, okay? Everyone takes a little here and there, it's factored into the budgets.

Character 1 [en]: [incredulous] Factored in?

Character 2 [en]: [rapidly] My cousin's site manager, he's the one who suggested it. Said I could make an extra two grand a month if I was smart about it.

Character 1 [en]: [hollow] Two grand a month. Jesus, Marcus, that's not skimming, that's organized theft. How long has this been going on?

Character 2 [en]: [quieter] Six months, maybe seven. Started small with just some rebar and wire, but then the opportunity kept presenting itself and I had bills to pay.

Character 1 [en]: If anyone traces this back here, we both lose this apartment. My name's on the lease too, you realize that, right?

Character 2 [en]: [desperately] Nobody's going to trace anything! I've been careful, I rotate sites, never take from the same project twice in a row. [sighs] This is how I'm keeping my head above water.

Character 1 [en]: [wistful] Remember when you moved in, you talked about saving up to start your own contracting business, doing things the right way?

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, well, that dream died when my dad's medical bills hit forty thousand. [bitter laugh] The right way doesn't pay for chemo treatments.

Character 1 [en]: You never told me.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated whisper] What was I supposed to say? That I'm stealing from job sites to keep my father alive? That every beam I pocket might buy him another month?

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] I want it all gone by tomorrow night, every piece, and then we need to figure out how to help your dad without you ending up in prison.

Character 2 [en]: [shakily] You're not calling the cops? Even after seeing all that down there, knowing what I've been doing under your roof?

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] No, I'm not calling anyone. But this stops now, Marcus. We'll find another way, even if it means I help with the medical bills myself.

Character 2 [en]: [breaking] I can't ask you to do that. You barely know my family, and this mess I've created, it's mine to clean up. [long exhale]
