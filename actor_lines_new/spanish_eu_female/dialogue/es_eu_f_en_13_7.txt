Character 1 [en]: Look, this whole authentic leadership crap at work is getting on my nerves.

Character 2 [en]: That term does get overused to death. Everyone says they want authentic leaders but then they panic when leaders actually show they're human beings with doubts and flaws.

Character 1 [en]: Boss tried it yesterday. Made a damn fool of himself crying about his divorce.

Character 2 [en]: That's not authentic leadership, that's having zero professional boundaries. Real authenticity means being consistent with your values and actions, not dumping your personal drama on people who report to you.

Character 1 [en]: Then what the hell is it supposed to mean?

Character 2 [en]: [warm] It's about matching your actions to your words. If you tell your team that family comes first but then punish them for leaving on time, you're not authentic, you're just another corporate hypocrite.

Character 1 [en]: [deep pitch] CEO keeps apologizing for stuff. That authentic enough for you?

Character 2 [en]: That's actually a solid example of it. Admitting "I made the wrong call, here's what we're doing differently" builds more trust than any motivational speech ever could.

Character 1 [en]: [gasp loudly] Makes her look weak if you ask me.

Character 2 [en]: Complete opposite actually. Everyone already knows when leadership screws up. Pretending otherwise just makes you look delusional and destroys whatever credibility you had left.

Character 1 [en]: [overly polite] Well that's certainly an interesting perspective you have there.

Character 2 [en]: I had a manager who'd tell us straight when corporate decisions were stupid, but she'd explain what constraints she was dealing with. That honesty made us trust her completely even when we hated the situation.

Character 1 [en]: Mine just spews buzzwords like a broken MBA textbook.

Character 2 [en]: Classic corporate theater. Real authentic leaders explain the reasoning behind tough decisions, even when those decisions are going to piss everyone off.

Character 1 [en]: So don't bullshit people. Revolutionary.

Character 2 [en]: Simple concept but incredibly hard to execute. The pressure to appear invincible when your team needs stability is overwhelming, especially during layoffs or restructuring.

Character 1 [en]: That why every exec sounds like a robot?

Character 2 [en]: Exactly right. They get coached to project unwavering confidence, to never admit uncertainty, to have instant answers for everything. Then they wonder why nobody believes a word they say.

Character 1 [en]: Last boss talked like a walking TED talk. Made me sick.

Character 2 [en]: Those types are exhausting. They speak in pure management consultant gibberish about leveraging synergies while having zero genuine connection with actual human beings trying to do their jobs.
