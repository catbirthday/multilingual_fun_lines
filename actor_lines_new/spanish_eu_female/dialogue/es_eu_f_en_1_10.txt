Character 1 [en]: What's your favorite book?

Character 2 [en]: [delighted] The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky. It's this sprawling exploration of faith, morality, and patricide that somehow manages to be both philosophically dense and emotionally devastating. I reread it every few years and find something new each time.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] You actually enjoy that pretentious garbage?

Character 2 [en]: [laugh hysterically] Pretentious garbage! That's fair, honestly. It's eight hundred pages of Russian men having existential crises. But there's something about the way Dostoyevsky dissects human nature that just gets to me.

Character 1 [en]: Have you read his other stuff?

Character 2 [en]: Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Notes from Underground. Each one feels like watching someone perform psychological surgery on themselves. The man understood guilt and redemption in ways that still feel uncomfortably relevant.

Character 1 [en]: [gasp] Wait, you've read all of those?

Character 2 [en]: Multiple times. Though I'll admit The Idiot took three attempts before I made it through. Prince Myshkin's goodness is almost harder to stomach than Raskolnikov's murders.

Character 1 [en]: That's... intense.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah.

Character 1 [en]: What about contemporary stuff?

Character 2 [en]: I bounce between genres. Recently finished Klara and the Sun by Ishiguro. It's narrated by an artificial friend observing human behavior, and the prose is deceptively simple for how much it manages to convey about loneliness and love.

Character 1 [en]: Science fiction?

Character 2 [en]: Sometimes. Though Ishiguro's more literary than sci-fi. For proper science fiction I go with Ted Chiang or N.K. Jemisin. They both use speculative elements to examine real social structures.

Character 1 [en]: Never heard of them.

Character 2 [en]: Chiang wrote the story that became Arrival. Jemisin won three consecutive Hugo Awards for her Broken Earth trilogy. Both writers make you rethink fundamental assumptions about reality and society.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] Makes me feel like I don't read enough.

Character 2 [en]: Reading isn't a competition. Some people devour books, others savor single pages. The point is finding what speaks to you, not hitting some arbitrary quota.

Character 1 [en]: [monotone] Very diplomatic answer.

Character 2 [en]: It's true though. Life's too short to read books you don't actually want to read. Unless it's for school, then you're stuck suffering through The Scarlet Letter like the rest of us.
