Character 1 [en]: [short pause] So you're the new shift lead everyone's talking about?

Character 2 [en]: [jealous] That's me—though I wouldn't say "everyone." More like... three people in accounting and whoever's been reading the bulletin board by the break room. Started last Monday; already memorized every SKU in the warehouse.

Character 1 [en]: Every single one?

Character 2 [en]: Four thousand, two hundred and thirty-seven unique items. The trick is creating mental maps—aisle by aisle, shelf by shelf—turning numbers into spatial memories. Your brain's better at remembering locations than arbitrary codes.

Character 1 [en]: That's impossible.

Character 2 [en]: [shy] Not impossible, just... disciplined. I spend my lunch breaks walking the floor, touching boxes, whispering product codes like mantras. People think I'm weird—they're not wrong—but efficiency ratings don't lie.

Character 1 [en]: How long have you been doing this?

Character 2 [en]: Warehouse work? Seven years. Leadership? Three months. Before this I was at the distribution center downtown—bigger operation, worse management. Here feels more... human-scaled.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Are you going to change everything around here?

Character 2 [en]: Change? No. Optimize? Absolutely. Small adjustments—shift rotations that match circadian rhythms, break schedules that prevent fatigue spikes. Nothing revolutionary; just paying attention to how bodies actually work.

Character 1 [en]: [extremely happy] That actually sounds amazing!

Character 2 [en]: [slurring] The data supports it—productivity increases when people aren't fighting their own biology. We're not machines; we're organisms with peaks and valleys. Work with the valleys, not against them.

Character 1 [en]: Where'd you learn all this?

Character 2 [en]: Night school, mostly. Industrial psychology, some ergonomics, a bit of operations research. Plus YouTube—endless rabbit holes about optimization theory while eating cereal at 2 AM.

Character 1 [en]: You studied while working full time?

Character 2 [en]: Four years of it. Classes Tuesday-Thursday, homework on breaks, papers written between truck unloadings. Coffee became a food group. Worth it though—knowledge compounds like interest.

Character 1 [en]: [happy] I'm actually excited to work with you.

Character 2 [en]: Good. Energy's contagious—positive or negative—it spreads through teams like temperature through metal. We keep the enthusiasm up, the whole shift benefits. Simple thermodynamics, really.

Character 1 [en]: You relate everything to science?

Character 2 [en]: Patterns exist everywhere—in box stacks, break room conversations, forklift routes. Once you start seeing the underlying structures, you can't unsee them. It's beautiful and maddening in equal measure.
