=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Maya? Is that you?

Character 2 [en]: [hushed disbelief] Don't say that name out loud, not here, not after all these years of being dead to everyone who knew me before.

Character 1 [en]: [barely breathing] They told us you died in the warehouse fire twelve years ago, showed us the dental records and everything. [voice cracking] I mourned you for months.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly urgent] The fire was real, the death wasn't—I had to disappear that night, and the bounty hunter identity kept me moving, kept me safe from the people who wanted me gone.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] You've been tracking me for three months, watching me from rooftops, following my subway routes, and you never once thought to just knock on my door?

Character 2 [en]: [softly] I needed to know if you'd changed, if you'd become someone who'd turn me in for the reward money instead of the kid who used to share their lunch with me. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [wounded whisper] You actually thought I'd sell you out? After everything we went through together in foster care, all those nights planning our escape to become artists?

Character 2 [en]: [quiet certainty] People change, Alex.

Character 1 [en]: [leaning closer] Not that much. Never that much. You need something from me, don't you? That's why you finally revealed yourself tonight.

Character 2 [en]: [exhales slowly] I need new identity documents, completely untraceable ones, and you're the only forger I trust who has the artistic skill to make them perfect. [quieter] The old ones are compromised.

Character 1 [en]: [hushed realization] That's why you've been studying my work, memorizing my techniques—you weren't hunting me, you were vetting me for this job. The bounty was just cover.

Character 2 [en]: [almost inaudible] The people who burned that warehouse are getting close again, and this time I need to disappear completely, become someone even you wouldn't recognize on the street.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] No. Absolutely not.

Character 2 [en]: [whispered panic] Alex, please, I wouldn't ask if there was any other way—I've survived alone this long but they're closing in and I'm running out of moves.

Character 1 [en]: I mean no to you disappearing again. [sighs] This time, we do it right—new identities for both of us, together, like we always planned.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned whisper] You can't be serious. You have a life here, a studio, clients who depend on your work, everything we dreamed about when we were kids.

Character 1 [en]: [soft but determined] I have a successful career built on forging other people's dreams into reality, but none of it means anything if my best friend is out there alone, running from ghosts.

Character 2 [en]: [voice breaking] I can't ask you to give up everything you've built. [barely audible] I already took twelve years from you by letting you think I was dead.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] You're not asking—I'm offering. Besides, my best work has always been collaborative, and we made a pretty good team back in the day. [quiet laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [whispered hope] Two artists on the run sounds like a terrible plan, but then again, [soft exhale], we always did specialize in making the impossible look easy.
