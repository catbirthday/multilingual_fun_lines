Scenario: A loyal valet tracks down the construction worker who saved his employer's life but has been avoiding the family's attempts to properly thank him.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Mr. Caldwell, I've been instructed to find you for three weeks now, and frankly, dodging an old man like me through half the city seems beneath someone of your, um, capabilities.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, I already told the lawyers I don't want any reward money, okay? I was just walking by when your boss had his heart attack, anyone would've done the CPR thing.

Character 1 [en]: [gently correcting] Anyone might have called an ambulance, sir, but you performed compressions for twelve minutes straight while his security detail stood there frozen. The doctors said those minutes were, well, everything.

Character 2 [en]: I work construction, alright? My arms were just, uh, trained for repetitive motion or whatever. [exhales] It wasn't heroic, it was muscle memory from operating a jackhammer.

Character 1 [en]: [measured] You tore your rotator cuff keeping him alive, Mr. Caldwell. I saw the medical bills you've been hiding from everyone, including that foreman who thinks you pulled it on the job site.

Character 2 [en]: How did you—Jesus, have you been following me? That's actually really creepy, man, I don't care how grateful your boss is, that crosses a line.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] For forty-three years I've dressed that man every morning, and now I get to keep doing it because of you. So yes, I've been, mmm, keeping tabs.

Character 2 [en]: This is insane.

Character 1 [en]: [voice cracking slightly] His granddaughter drew you a picture, you know? She calls you the 'sidewalk angel' because that's where her mommy told her angels appear when people need them most.

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, please don't do this to me right now, I can't—I'm not good with kids or thank you cards or any of this emotional stuff, okay? [shaky breath]

Character 1 [en]: [softly insistent] Mr. Thornton isn't offering you money anymore, he understands you won't take it. He's offering you his orthopedic surgeon, the one who fixed his shoulder after his polo accident.

Character 2 [en]: [stunned] I... what? No, that's gotta cost more than I make in a year, probably two years, and I already told you people I don't want charity.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] It's not charity, sir. [pause] It's one man who knows about damaged shoulders making sure another man can keep using his arms to save lives, or operate jackhammers, or whatever else you choose.

Character 2 [en]: Why do you even care so much? You're just his valet, you could work for any rich family in the city, they'd probably pay you better anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [emotionally firm] Just his valet? That man taught me English when I arrived here with nothing, paid for my citizenship classes, walked my daughter down the aisle when her father couldn't. [trembling] He's my family.

Character 2 [en]: Shit. I didn't... um, I didn't know any of that. [long exhale] The newspapers just said he was some Wall Street guy who collapsed.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] He's complicated, yes, but aren't we all? Your foreman, by the way, he mentioned you've been teaching CPR classes at the community center since the incident.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive chuckle] That's not—I mean, it's just once a week, and only because they were short on instructors. It's really not a big deal.

Character 1 [en]: Thirty-four people now know how to save a life because you couldn't stop yourself from teaching them. [gentle laugh] But sure, Mr. Caldwell, you're definitely not a hero.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly resigned] Fine. Okay. I'll take the surgeon referral, but that's it, nothing else, and your boss has to stop sending his people after me. Deal?
