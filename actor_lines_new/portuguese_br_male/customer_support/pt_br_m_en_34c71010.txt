=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Good afternoon. I need to close a commercial fleet account. The account holder, James Morrison, passed away last week.

Customer Support [en]: I'm very sorry for your loss. I'll certainly help you with closing the account. May I have the fleet account number and your relationship to Mr. Morrison?

Customer [en]: The account number is FLT-8847-JM. I've been driving for Morrison Funeral Services for twelve years.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I see the Morrison Funeral Services fleet account with seven vehicles registered under license FLT-8847-JM. To proceed with the closure, I'll need to verify some information and understand the disposition of the vehicles.

Customer [en]: I have power of attorney documents from the estate executor. All vehicles are being transferred to new ownership.

Customer Support [en]: Excellent. I'll need you to submit those documents to our legal department at fleetservices@company.com, reference case number CLO-2847-MS. Are you authorized to handle the final billing and any outstanding maintenance contracts?

Customer [en]: Yes, I'm handling all fleet-related matters. There should be three active maintenance contracts and current billing through this month.

Customer Support [en]: Correct. I show three platinum maintenance contracts, numbers MC-7891-A through MC-7891-C, all paid through the 31st. The current billing cycle shows a balance of $4,247.85, which includes this month's lease payments and fuel card charges.

Customer [en]: That sounds accurate. The estate will issue payment within ten business days. What's the process for the fuel cards?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly.

Customer [en]: And the GPS tracking units in each vehicle need to be deactivated as well.

Customer Support [en]: I'll deactivate all seven GPS units effective midnight tonight, serial numbers GPS-5501 through GPS-5507. The fuel cards ending in 4421, 4422, and 4423 will be canceled simultaneously, and I'll email you the final fuel report.

Customer [en]: Good. Will there be any early termination penalties on the lease agreements?

Customer Support [en]: Due to the circumstances, I'm waiving all early termination fees, which would have totaled $8,750. I've added override code WV-3847-DEC to your account, and you'll receive written confirmation within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: I appreciate that. The vehicles will be returned to your Riverside location by Friday.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. Please return them to our Riverside facility at 2847 Industrial Boulevard, open Monday through Friday 8 AM to 6 PM. Ensure each vehicle has at least a quarter tank of fuel and bring all sets of keys.

Customer [en]: Everything will be in order. Can you send all final documentation to the estate attorney?

Customer Support [en]: Of course.

Customer [en]: That's Stephen Brennan at Brennan and Associates, 1500 Market Street, Suite 400.

Customer Support [en]: I have that recorded as Stephen Brennan, Brennan and Associates, 1500 Market Street, Suite 400. All closure documentation, including form CLO-9982 and the final account statement, will be sent there within five business days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
