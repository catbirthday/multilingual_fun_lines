=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: *exhales* I just... I don't even know where to start with this.

Customer Support [en]: Alright, I've got your account pulled up here, member ID VHB-2847-MK, and I can already see what's happening—vineyard classifications change during off-season, so let's get this sorted out quick.

Customer [en]: *sharp inhale* Wait, classifications? I thought I had the same plan all year.

Customer Support [en]: So here's the thing—actually no, let me back up—when you're coded as seasonal agricultural worker, which you are under classification SAW-47B, your coverage runs April through October, then it switches to... well, that's where it gets complicated.

Customer [en]: *long exhale* God. I can't... I just can't deal with another thing right now.

Customer Support [en]: I hear you, I really do, and look, I've handled probably three hundred of these exact cases, so here's what we're gonna do—I'm applying override code VINESEAS-2024 right now, which bridges that gap retroactively.

Customer [en]: You can do that? I mean... I know this isn't your fault. The system is just...

Customer Support [en]: The system's a mess, you're absolutely right, but the good news is—and I'm looking at your claims here, looks like $1,847.30 in pending charges—all of those are gonna get reprocessed under continuous coverage.

Customer [en]: *exhales slowly* Eighteen hundred. Jesus. I didn't even realize it was that much.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, it adds up fast when you're in that coverage gap, but here's what I'm—actually, let me just... okay, I've initiated batch reprocess request BPR-9901-XZ, should clear within 48 hours.

Customer [en]: I'm sorry. I'm being... This whole harvest was rough and now this.

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: *sharp breath* My prescriptions though. Those won't stop, right?

Customer Support [en]: So your maintenance meds are protected under continuity provision MED-CONT-7, which means even if there's a gap in primary coverage, those three prescriptions—I see metformin, lisinopril, and sertraline at $47.50 monthly—those stay active no matter what.

Customer [en]: Okay. *long pause* Okay. That's... that's something at least.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: How did this even happen? I've been with the vineyard for four years.

Customer Support [en]: What happens is—and this is super common—your employer submits form EMP-8834 for seasonal status changes, but if they miss the October 15th deadline, which yours did by six days, the system just... drops you into limbo basically.

Customer [en]: *exhales* Of course they missed it. Of course. Sorry, I know you're trying to help.

Customer Support [en]: Listen, I've backdated everything to October 1st using exemption code AGWORK-EX, so you're fully covered now, no gaps, and honestly? Your employer's getting a notification about this deadline issue, so hopefully next season goes smoother.
