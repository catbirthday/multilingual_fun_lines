=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confused] Twenty-three years. [pause] Twenty-three years I've been with this company and they're replacing me with— with what, software? [bitter] An AI assistant. [laugh] That's what Richard just said, sitting there with his stupid sympathetic face. [angry] "The company is moving in a new direction." [sarcastic] Oh, that's original. [frustrated] Like I haven't scheduled every meeting, remembered every birthday, covered for him when he forgot his anniversary— twice. [upset] But sure, let's see ChatGPT do that. [very sad] I trained three different CEOs at this company. [pause] Three. [quietly] And now they're telling me I'm... obsolete? [shaky voice] That's the word they used. [angry] Obsolete. Like I'm a— a fax machine or something. [cry] My daughter just started college. [sniffle] I'm fifty-seven years old, what am I supposed to— [trailing off] I don't even know how to... [long pause] [bitter] You know what the worst part is? They want me to train it. [laugh loudly] They actually want me to spend my last two weeks teaching this thing how to do my job. [furious] Teaching it all my little tricks, my systems, everything I've built. [very quietly] Twenty-three years. [exhausted] And they gave me fifteen minutes notice before security escorts me out.
