Subject: Your child's teacher saying your kid is the most respectful and helpful student they've had in years

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [warm] I just have to tell you, your child is... honestly, I've been teaching for fifteen years and I—I rarely see this. [pause] The respect they show, not just to me but to every single classmate, it's remarkable. Yesterday, um, we had a new student join us, right? And before I could even, you know, figure out the seating arrangement, your kid had already made space, shared their supplies, just... [very sincerely] It brought tears to my eyes, truly. And this happens constantly. They'll notice when someone's struggling with math and just, er, quietly offer help. Not in a show-offy way, but genuinely caring. [emotional] I don't know what you're doing at home, but whatever it is, please keep doing it. [pause] The other day, hmm, I dropped all my papers in the hallway—stack this high—and they stopped, helped me pick up every single one, organized them even. Didn't ask for anything, didn't need recognition. [short pause] You know what they said? "You looked tired, Ms. Johnson." [voice breaking] In twenty-three kids, they're the only one who noticed. [proudly] Your child is going to do incredible things in this world. They already are.
