Character 1 [en]: So honestly, I think most people who claim they have anxiety disorders are just, uhh, looking for excuses to avoid uncomfortable situations.

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, that's... that's a pretty strong statement to make. What makes you think people are, like, fabricating their experiences? Because the research shows these are actual neurological conditions with measurable brain chemistry differences, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Come on, everyone gets nervous sometimes. That's just being human, not having a disorder.

Character 2 [en]: Well, sure, everyone experiences anxiety, but there's a huge difference between normal nervousness and, um, clinical anxiety disorders. It's like saying everyone gets sad sometimes so depression isn't real—the intensity and duration matter enormously, and for some people it's genuinely debilitating.

Character 1 [en]: [shy] I mean, I get anxious too but I just... push through it.

Character 2 [en]: Right, and that's great that you can do that, really. But imagine if that anxiety was, er, ten times stronger and happened constantly—like your brain literally won't stop producing stress hormones even when there's no actual threat. That's basically what people with anxiety disorders are dealing with every single day.

Character 1 [en]: [excited] But that's exactly my point! If they just practiced more, built up tolerance, they could overcome it!

Character 2 [en]: Ahh, okay, so you're thinking of it like building a muscle, which I get. But would you tell someone with diabetes to just practice producing insulin? Some conditions require actual medical intervention, not just willpower, and anxiety disorders fall into that category for many people.

Character 1 [en]: That's completely different. Diabetes is a physical condition.

Character 2 [en]: Actually, anxiety disorders are physical too—there are measurable differences in brain structure and, umm, neurotransmitter function. The amygdala can be overactive, serotonin levels can be off, cortisol regulation gets disrupted... I mean, these are tangible biological differences we can literally see on brain scans.

Character 1 [en]: Okay but medication is just a crutch. People become dependent instead of learning real coping skills.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, I hear what you're saying about dependency concerns, which are valid. But for many people, medication actually makes it possible to learn those coping skills in the first place—like, when your anxiety is so severe you can't even leave the house, therapy becomes pretty difficult, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [chuckle] So everyone needs pills now? That's convenient for pharmaceutical companies.

Character 2 [en]: [mocking] Oh sure, it's all just Big Pharma conspiracy, right? Look, nobody's saying everyone needs medication, but dismissing legitimate treatment options because some companies profit is, uhh, pretty harmful to people who genuinely need help. Would you make the same argument about insulin or chemotherapy?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Well maybe if people weren't so coddled these days, they'd develop actual resilience.

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, that's... wow. You seem really invested in this idea that suffering builds character or something. Can I ask—and I mean this gently—have you considered that maybe your own relationship with anxiety might be, er, influencing how you see this?

Character 1 [en]: What's that supposed to mean?

Character 2 [en]: Well, you mentioned pushing through your own anxiety earlier, and now you're basically angry at people who can't do the same. Sometimes when we've had to white-knuckle through something difficult, it's, like, painful to see others getting help we didn't have—it can feel unfair, you know?

Character 1 [en]: I'm not angry, I just think people should try harder before claiming they're disabled.

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, but here's the thing—most people with anxiety disorders have tried incredibly hard, often for years, before seeking help. They're not taking the easy way out; they're finally acknowledging that, uhh, what they're experiencing isn't normal and that it's okay to need support. That actually takes tremendous strength.
