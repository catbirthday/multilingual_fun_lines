Character 1 [en]: So get this—my roommate has created what I'm calling "Mount Dishmore" in our sink. It's been there for five days.

Character 2 [en]: [condescending] Oh, you're keeping track of the days now? Look, some people just weren't raised with basic household skills. Maybe they need a little education about how sinks work—you know, water, soap, the revolutionary concept of scrubbing.

Character 1 [en]: I even made a time-lapse video of it growing. Want to see?

Character 2 [en]: Wait, you actually documented it? That's brilliant. You've got evidence now if things escalate. Plus there's something darkly satisfying about watching someone's laziness pile up in real time.

Character 1 [en]: Yesterday I found fruit flies having a party in there. They didn't even invite me.

Character 2 [en]: Fruit flies are where I draw the line. That's not just messy anymore, that's a health hazard. You're literally living with an insect breeding ground because your roommate can't manage basic adulting.

Character 1 [en]: I've been eating all my meals straight from the pot to avoid adding to it. Like some kind of dish-avoiding ninja.

Character 2 [en]: You shouldn't have to live like that in your own home. It's ridiculous that you're changing your entire routine just to accommodate their laziness. This needs to stop immediately.

Character 1 [en]: Think a strongly worded PowerPoint presentation would help?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Stop trying to be creative about this. You need to have a direct conversation, today. No PowerPoints, no passive-aggressive notes, just "clean your dishes or find a new place to live."

Character 1 [en]: But my PowerPoint has animations and everything! Dishes flying off the screen!

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Oh god, please tell me you haven't actually made this yet. The last thing you want is to turn this into a joke when it's genuinely affecting your quality of life. They might not take you seriously.

Character 1 [en]: [joking] Fine, I'll save it for my TED Talk: "How I Survived the Great Dish Crisis of 2024."

Character 2 [en]: [stern] This isn't funny anymore. You're deflecting because confrontation is hard, but those dishes are going to attract worse than fruit flies soon. Mice, roaches, who knows what else.

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] You're right! I'm going in! If you don't hear from me, tell my mother I died bravely!

Character 2 [en]: There you go! Channel that energy into the actual conversation. Be firm, be clear, and don't back down when they try to make excuses or promise they'll do better "tomorrow."

Character 1 [en]: What if I just start charging them a "dish sitting fee"? Five dollars per day, per dish?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, that's not the worst idea. Make it official—write it up, have them sign it. Sometimes hitting people in the wallet is the only way to change behavior.

Character 1 [en]: I could use the money to hire someone to wash them. Or buy paper plates for the rest of my life.

Character 2 [en]: Paper plates would certainly solve the immediate problem. But honestly, if you have to resort to that in your own home, it might be time to find a roommate who understands basic hygiene.
