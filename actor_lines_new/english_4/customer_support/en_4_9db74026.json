It looks like it was—wait no, sorry, I'm looking at the wrong screen. Let me check your actual payment history."

The routing number we have is 021000322 but apparently there was an issue with your account number ending in 8847. Did you recently change banks or anything?"

Your payment was flagged for, er, \"invalid account status\" which usually means... ah, did you maybe freeze your account temporarily? Like for fraud protection or something?"

Your payment of $1,847.23 is basically sitting in limbo right now. But I can—let me see here—I can reissue it either as a paper check to arrive by October 30th or we could retry the direct deposit."

So if we do the paper check with tracking number EXP-7792-Q, you'll have it by October 27th, or, uh, if your bank account is working again, the direct deposit would hit tomorrow morning around 3 AM Eastern."

            "content": "Yeah no, I hear you. Honestly, I'm putting the code URGENT-PAY on your case right now, which... so this basically bypasses the normal queue. Your confirmation number is PAY-20241025-8829X. And look, er, if it doesn't show up by tomorrow at noon, you call back with that number and ask for a supervisor directly, okay?"

            "content": "Perfect, alright so I'm resubmitting that now... okay it's processing. Oh and actually, because of the delay, I'm also seeing here that you're eligible for a $50 inconvenience credit. That'll be added as code COMP-1025 on your next payment, so November 5th you'll see $1,897.23 instead of your regular amount."

Transaction ID TXN-884729-B for the resubmit is confirmed, and, mm, you should get an email within the next hour showing all these details."
