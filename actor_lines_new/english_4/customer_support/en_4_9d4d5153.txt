=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I think I'm in the right place? Third transfer. About tips.

Customer Support: Oh no—third time? That's ridiculous. Let me—actually wait, let me pull up your account first. What's your guide ID?

Customer: It's it's TG-4429. Maybe TG-4428? No, 29. Definitely 29.

Customer Support: Got it, TG-4429. I see you're with City Explorer Tours, active since 2021, current rating 4.8 stars. Now tell me what's happening with the tips.

Customer: The app says I got tips. But they're not... they're not there?

Customer Support: Okay so—here's what I'm seeing. Your last three tour groups, dates 11/15, 11/16, and 11/17, show tip amounts of $45.00, $62.50, and $38.00 respectively. But you're saying those didn't hit your account?

Customer: That's exactly right. I mean, probably. Those sound like the right amounts.

Customer Support: You know what? I used to drive rideshare before this job, and the same thing happened to me once. Let me check your payout settings—account ending in 7739?

Customer: Seven seven... I think so? Or maybe 7779?

Customer Support: Actually I see two accounts here. Primary is Wells Fargo ending 7739, and there's an old Chase account ending 7779 that's still marked active. The tips went to the Chase one.

Customer: Chase? But I closed that. I sort of closed it. Maybe?

Customer Support: Yeah so—the bank shows it as open but restricted. The deposits bounced back to us on 11/20. Hold on, I'm gonna—no actually, we're fixing this right now.

Customer: Can you just... what do I need to do here?

Customer Support: Nothing. I'm pushing through a manual override, auth code MC-88291-X. The full amount, that's $145.50 total, will hit your Wells Fargo account within 2-3 hours.

Customer: Two to three hours? That's that's actually today?

Customer Support: Today. I'm also removing that Chase account from your profile completely, case number CS-20241122-8847 for your records. No more confusion.

Customer: I've been calling about this for... okay okay, you actually fixed it.

Customer Support: Listen, three transfers is insane. I'm adding a $25.00 service credit to your account too. You shouldn't have to explain this three times.

Customer: That's really... I mean, I just needed the tips but...

Customer Support: The tips are yours, you earned them. Credit's just because we wasted your time. Your new balance with the credit shows $170.50 pending. Should see it all really soon.
