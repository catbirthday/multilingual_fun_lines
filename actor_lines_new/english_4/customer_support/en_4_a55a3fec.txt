=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I recently enrolled in your Premier Health Plan and I'd like to clarify what services are covered.

Customer Support: Good afternoon and thank you for calling. I'd be happy to review your Premier Health Plan coverage, policy number PHP-2024-88734. Let me pull up your account details right now.

Customer: Excellent, thank you. I'm particularly concerned about specialist visits and whether I need referrals.

Customer Support: I can confirm that your Premier Health Plan includes specialist coverage with a $40 copay per visit. You do not need referrals for in-network specialists, which gives you direct access to care when needed.

Customer: That's reassuring to hear. What about diagnostic procedures like MRIs or CT scans?

Customer Support: Certainly. Advanced imaging procedures including MRIs, CT scans, and PET scans are covered after you meet your $500 annual deductible. You'll then pay 20% coinsurance, with your maximum out-of-pocket capped at $3,500 per year.

Customer: I appreciate the clarity. Are preventive screenings handled differently from diagnostic procedures?

Customer Support: Absolutely, they are handled quite differently. Preventive screenings such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and annual wellness exams are covered at 100% with no deductible required when you use in-network providers.

Customer: Perfect. Could you explain how prescription coverage works under this plan?

Customer Support: Of course.

Customer: And are there different tiers for medications?

Customer Support: Yes, your prescription benefit uses a four-tier formulary system. Tier 1 generic medications have a $10 copay, Tier 2 preferred brand names are $35, Tier 3 non-preferred brands are $75, and Tier 4 specialty drugs require 30% coinsurance up to $250 per prescription.

Customer: That's helpful. What about mental health services and therapy sessions?

Customer Support: Mental health services are covered equally to medical services under your plan. Individual therapy sessions have a $40 copay, matching specialist visits, and you have unlimited annual visits when using network providers, case number MH-77901 for reference.

Customer: Excellent coverage. Is emergency room care covered if I'm traveling out of state?

Customer Support: Emergency room visits are covered nationwide and internationally at in-network rates. You'll pay a $350 copay per visit, which is waived if you're admitted to the hospital within 24 hours of the emergency room visit.

Customer: That's very comprehensive. How do I find in-network providers in my area?

Customer Support: You can access our provider directory through your member portal at premierhealthnetwork.com using your member ID PHP88734001. Alternatively, I can email you a direct link to search providers by specialty and location within your ZIP code area.

Customer: Please send that link. One final question about dental and vision coverage.

Customer Support: I'll send that link immediately to your registered email. Your current Premier Health Plan doesn't include dental or vision coverage, but we offer supplemental plans starting at $18.50 monthly for dental and $12.75 for vision that integrate seamlessly with your existing benefits.
