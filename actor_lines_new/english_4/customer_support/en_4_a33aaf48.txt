=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Hi so—no wait let me—okay I've never done this but there's this charge and I don't—I mean I need help disputing it?

Customer Support: Okay, um, let me help you with that. Can I get your account number first? Should be, uh, starts with ACC and then some digits.

Customer: Oh yeah—wait I have it—ACC-7792461 and thanks so much I'm kinda freaking out here never disputed anything before!

Customer Support: Got it, pulling that up now... hmm, busy morning here but I see the account. So what's the charge amount we're, er, looking at today?

Customer: Forty-seven fifty and—no wait actually—forty-seven ninety-five from some place called TechMart but I never—I didn't buy anything there!

Customer Support: Okay I see it here, transaction ID TRX-9847-MK22 for $47.95. Um, this was processed three days ago at 2:14 PM. Does that ring any bells at all?

Customer: No I was—wait I was on duty—lifeguard shift at the pool so couldn't have been me you're really helping here thank you!

Customer Support: Right, so here's what we'll do, uh, I'm opening dispute case DSP-3384-YK right now. Between you and me? These TechMart ones, we see them a lot lately. Probably gonna be pretty straightforward.

Customer: Oh that's—wait really—that's such a relief I thought I'd messed something up somehow you guys are great seriously!

Customer Support: Ha, well, er, you're doing everything right actually. Need to ask though—is your card ending in 8823 still in your possession? Just standard procedure but important.

Customer: Yes got it—no wait let me check—yeah right here in my wallet never lost it which is why this whole thing's so weird!

Customer Support: Perfect, noting that down... hmm, system's being slow today. Okay so provisional credit of $47.95 will post within, uh, usually twenty-four to forty-eight hours to your account.

Customer: Wait you're—already fixing it—that fast? Oh man I was expecting hours of calls and forms you're amazing thank you!

Customer Support: Well, um, here's the thing—since you caught it quick and card's secure, I can fast-track this under code FT-9982. Don't usually advertise that option but, er, you seem pretty stressed about your first dispute.

Customer: I am—was—you're literally saving my week here I use that money for gas to get to the pool for work!

Customer Support: Totally get it. So confirmation number for all this is CNF-7729-BK41. Um, keep that handy. Also, between us? Maybe set up transaction alerts on your account—helps catch stuff faster.

Customer: Oh that's—I didn't know—how do I do that actually you're being so helpful I really appreciate this!

Customer Support: Easy actually, uh, I can enable them right now. Just did it—you'll get texts for anything over, hmm, what threshold works? Standard's twenty-five dollars but can customize.

Customer: Twenty-five's good—perfect actually—thanks for taking time to explain everything when you're clearly having a crazy day there!

Customer Support: Hey, er, making your day better makes mine better honestly. New temporary card ending in 4421 arrives in three to five business days. Anything else I can help with while I've got you?
