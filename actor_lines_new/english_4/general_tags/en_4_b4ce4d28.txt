Scenario: A plastic surgeon confronts their records manager late at night after discovering a hidden archive of evidence documenting the surgeon's pattern of operating while impaired.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly controlled] I found your little archive room behind the old filing cabinets, um, the one you thought nobody knew about with all those patient files that were supposed to be destroyed years ago.

Character 2: [measured] Those files contain evidence of procedures that went wrong, things that families deserved to know about, and, well, I couldn't just shred them like you ordered.

Character 1: [descending into frustration] You realize what you've done, right? I mean, those complications were all within acceptable medical parameters, but taken out of context they look, uh, they look damning.

Character 2: [whispered defiance] Mrs. Chen's facial paralysis wasn't within acceptable parameters, and neither was the infection that nearly killed the teenager you operated on last March—I have all the photos, the, um, the real ones.

Character 1: [colder] Every surgery carries risks, which patients sign off on, and frankly, you're not qualified to determine what constitutes malpractice versus unfortunate but statistically inevitable outcomes. [exhales sharply]

Character 2: I've been doing this for fifteen years, cataloging every single procedure in this practice, and, look, I know the difference between a complication and, well, negligence caused by you operating after drinking at those pharmaceutical dinners. [pause]

Character 1: [dangerously quiet] That's a serious accusation you're making, one that could destroy not just my career but the livelihoods of everyone who works here, including yours.

Character 2: [steadier] The accountability isn't my problem—it's yours, and, um, maybe if you're worried about everyone's livelihoods, you should've thought about that before scheduling surgeries after your liquid lunches.

Character 1: You have no proof of anything like that, just, what, circumstantial timing that any lawyer would tear apart in seconds, assuming you're even willing to risk everything.

Character 2: [deliberate] I have security footage timestamped with your keycard entries, receipts from the restaurant downstairs, and, uh, most importantly, I have the OR logs showing your hand tremors noted by nurses who were too scared to speak up.

Character 1: Those nurses work for me, they'll say whatever I tell them to say, and you're forgetting that I have connections at every hospital and clinic in this state.

Character 2: Three of those nurses already gave statements to the medical board investigator who contacted me last week, which is, actually, why I'm telling you this now instead of just disappearing with the files. [sighs]

Character 1: [stunned whisper] The medical board? You went to the medical board without even, I mean, without giving me a chance to explain or, or make things right?

Character 2: [firmly] They came to me after the Chen family filed a complaint, and once they started asking questions, I couldn't, um, I couldn't lie when people's lives are at stake.

Character 1: [desperately logical] We can still fix this, okay? Those files, if you give them to me, I can review everything and, uh, present a comprehensive response that protects everyone, including the patients.

Character 2: [shaking head] The investigator already has copies of everything, digital and physical, so there's no fixing this anymore—it's just, well, it's about minimizing the damage now. [quieter] Maybe you should get a lawyer.

Character 1: [hollow] Twenty years.

Character 2: [gently] Twenty years of mostly good work, sure, but also twenty years of me watching you slide from occasional mistakes to, um, whatever you want to call what you've become now. [long exhale]

Character 1: [defeated whisper] When did you stop believing in me? Was it gradual or was there, like, one specific moment when you decided I wasn't worth protecting anymore?

Character 2: It was the Chen surgery, watching you on the monitors as your hands shook while you tried to correct the nerve placement, knowing you'd been drinking and knowing that, uh, that woman trusted you with her face. [almost inaudible] That's when I knew I couldn't keep your secrets anymore.
