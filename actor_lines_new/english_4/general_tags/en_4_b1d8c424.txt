Scenario: During a campus lockdown, a janitor who never finished high school discovers an international student hiding in tears in a supply closet after receiving news that their home country has closed its borders indefinitely.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled] Hey, someone's in here— wait, you're crying. Look, I know the lockdown's scary but campus security said it's just precautionary.

Character 2: It's not the lockdown, it's my country, they just announced the borders are closed and nobody can enter or leave indefinitely. [voice breaking]

Character 1: [sitting down heavily] Jesus. Which country, if you don't mind me asking? I've been cleaning these buildings for twelve years and I've heard a lot of stories, but that's rough.

Character 2: Myanmar. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: My grandmother fled Hungary in '56, never saw her parents again. Different situation but, [exhales], borders closing like that, it changes everything you thought was solid.

Character 2: [defensive] You don't understand—I'm supposed to graduate next month, my family sold their shop to pay for this degree, and now I can't even tell them if I'm safe because the internet's been cut.

Character 1: [quietly] You're right, I don't understand exactly what you're going through. But I know what it's like to feel trapped between two worlds that don't quite fit.

Character 2: How could you possibly know that?

Character 1: Because I'm the only one in my family without a degree, pushing a mop while my siblings run companies, but I'm also the only one who remembers grandma's stories in Hungarian.

Character 2: [softer] She taught you Hungarian while everyone else was focused on getting ahead in America. That's actually beautiful in a way I didn't expect from, well—

Character 1: [chuckling] From the janitor? It's okay, most people don't expect much from me. Makes it easier to help when things go sideways, like finding scared students in supply closets.

Character 2: I'm not scared, I'm just completely lost about what happens next. Four years of mechanical engineering, perfect grades, three job offers, and suddenly none of it matters.

Character 1: [firmly] It all matters. Your family sold their shop because they believed in your future, not because they needed you to come home with a permission slip from the government.

Character 2: [trembling] But what if I never see them again? What if this degree just becomes a piece of paper that reminds me of everything I lost?

Character 1: Then you make damn sure it becomes more than paper. My grandmother never went back to Hungary, but she built things here that mattered—including teaching a stubborn kid Magyar nursery rhymes.

Character 2: [crying openly] I don't even know where to start. The international student office is closed for the lockdown, my advisor won't answer emails, and my roommate keeps asking if I'm okay.

Character 1: Start by getting out of this closet. There's a coffee machine in the maintenance break room that actually works, and I've got about forty minutes before I need to check the south building.

Character 2: [wiping eyes] You're offering to help me? But you don't even know my name, and I basically just insulted your job.

Character 1: [standing up] Name's Ray, and you're not the first engineering student to underestimate me. Come on, crying alone in the dark never fixed anything, trust me on that one.

Character 2: [shakily standing] I'm Thiri. And, [exhales], thank you, Ray. For not just walking away when you found me here.
