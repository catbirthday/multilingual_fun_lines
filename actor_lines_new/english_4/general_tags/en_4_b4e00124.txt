Scenario: A combat veteran meets with the plastic surgeon who will reconstruct their face after an IED explosion that killed three of their squad members.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] The blast pattern's still mapped across my face, Doctor Chen, like a roadmap of that day in Kandahar when everything went wrong.

Character 2: [respectfully] I've reviewed your medical files and the field hospital photos, and I want you to know that what we're discussing today is entirely reconstructive, not cosmetic.

Character 1: Three of my squad didn't make it out of that Humvee, and here I am worried about whether I'll look normal again. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [gently] Survivor's guilt is something I see in many veterans, but wanting to recognize yourself in the mirror isn't vanity—it's part of healing, part of reclaiming who you are.

Character 1: My daughter, she's seven now, and she still flinches when she sees the left side of my face in direct sunlight.

Character 2: [measured] The scar tissue can be significantly reduced, and we can restore much of the original bone structure using grafts from your hip, though I won't promise perfection.

Character 1: Perfection. [hollow laugh]

Character 2: [carefully] The pioneering techniques we're using now weren't available even five years ago—3D printed scaffolds, nerve regeneration protocols that can restore sensation you've probably lost.

Character 1: Rodriguez and Murphy had families too, kids who won't see their fathers again, and I get to sit here discussing nerve regeneration. [exhales]

Character 2: You protected your squad for three years before that day, and from what I understand from your commanding officer, you pulled two wounded soldiers out after the explosion, despite your injuries. [pause]

Character 1: [defensive] That's just what you do, what any of us would have done—it doesn't make me special or deserving of some miracle surgery.

Character 2: This isn't about deserving or not deserving; it's about giving you the tools to move forward, to be present for that seven-year-old daughter who needs her father whole.

Character 1: [strained] Whole.

Character 2: The procedures will take multiple stages over eighteen months, and there will be significant pain during recovery, but based on similar cases, we can achieve remarkable results.

Character 1: [quietly] Sometimes I wonder if keeping the scars would be more honest, like wearing the truth of what happened instead of trying to erase it. [sighs]

Character 2: We're not erasing anything.

Character 1: [softer] Every morning I trace these scars and remember the exact moment the IED detonated, the sound Garcia made, the way the world went silent and orange.

Character 2: The memories won't change regardless of what we do surgically, but you deserve to choose how you present yourself to the world, not have that choice made by shrapnel.

Character 1: [wavering] My wife says I hide behind these scars now, use them as a wall to keep everyone at distance, even her.

Character 2: [warmly] The surgery is just one part of the journey, and I work closely with trauma counselors who specialize in combat veterans—this is about healing more than skin deep.
