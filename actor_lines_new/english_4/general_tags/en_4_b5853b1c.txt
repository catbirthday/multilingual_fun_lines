Scenario: Two former high school best friends who work across the street from each other unknowingly reunite at their mutual friend's funeral, realizing they've wasted years that could have been spent together.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] I didn't think you'd be here, after everything that happened between us and Marcus back in high school, but I guess we all grew up eventually.

Character 2: Yeah, well, Marcus reached out about five years ago when I was going through my divorce, and we started talking again like nothing had changed. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: [wistful] He was always like that, wasn't he? Could hold a grudge for exactly three seconds before forgetting why he was mad in the first place.

Character 2: Remember how he used to obsess over the tiniest details in shop class, measuring everything three times while we just wanted to finish and get out?

Character 1: [rueful] Now I spend my days adjusting carburetor mixtures down to the millimeter, and you're probably counting every pound of string tension like your life depends on it.

Character 2: Eighteen to twenty-eight pounds, depending on the player's style and the racket composition, and yeah, [exhales], Marcus would've loved the irony of us becoming precision freaks.

Character 1: [softly] His wife said he kept talking about organizing a reunion for the three of us, kept putting it off because he wanted it to be perfect.

Character 2: That's what kills me—we had fifteen years to do this, and now we're standing here in our dress shoes talking about string tension at his funeral. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: [voice cracking] I fix engines that people depend on for their livelihoods, but I couldn't fix this, couldn't make time for one stupid weekend to see him.

Character 2: Stop, man, we're all guilty of that—thinking there's always next month, next year, next whatever, until suddenly there isn't.

Character 1: [barely audible] You know what the worst part is? I drive past your shop every morning on my way to the marina, been doing it for three years.

Character 2: Wait, you work at Riverside Marina? I string for the country club literally across the street—we've been that close this whole time? [incredulous]

Character 1: [hollow] Every morning at seven-thirty, I see your van parked out front with that stupid tennis ball logo you probably designed yourself, just like in high school.

Character 2: Jesus, we're idiots, aren't we? Marcus would've walked across that street himself and dragged us together if he'd known. [shaky exhale]

Character 1: [firmly] Look, I know this is probably the grief talking, but do you want to grab coffee after this? Like, actually follow through this time?

Character 2: Yeah, I do—there's that place on Marina Drive that opens early, and I think, [sighs], I think Marcus would want us to stop being strangers.

Character 1: [gentle] He left us both something in his will, his lawyer said, but wouldn't tell me what—just said we'd understand when we saw it.

Character 2: Knowing him, it's probably those matching Swiss Army knives we all bought senior year, the ones we swore we'd carry forever. [melancholy chuckle]

Character 1: [thoughtful] Mine's in my toolbox.

Character 2: Mine too, third drawer down, still use it for cutting grip tape even though I have better tools now—guess some promises you keep without realizing. [soft sob]
