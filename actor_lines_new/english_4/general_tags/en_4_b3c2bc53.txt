Scenario: A pilot trainee confesses to an aircraft mechanic that they took an unauthorized flight in a plane scheduled for passengers the next day and heard concerning mechanical noises.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [trembling] I need to tell you something about the Cessna in bay three, the one you've been working on all week—something happened during my solo practice yesterday.

Character 2: That plane's scheduled for a charter flight tomorrow morning with six passengers aboard, so whatever you're about to say better not involve damage. [sharp inhale]

Character 1: [barely breathing] I took it up without clearance when you were at lunch, just wanted to log some extra hours, but I heard this grinding noise during descent.

Character 2: [dangerously quiet] You flew my plane without authorization? The one I just spent forty hours rebuilding the hydraulic system on?

Character 1: I know, I know.

Character 2: No, you don't know—that grinding could be metal shavings in the hydraulics, could be stress fractures, could be a dozen things that kill people. [voice rising]

Character 1: [desperate] That's why I'm here, telling you now instead of letting you find out during pre-flight, because I couldn't live with myself if something happened to those passengers.

Character 2: You couldn't live with yourself? [bitter laugh] Six people could die because you wanted to play pilot, and you're worried about your conscience?

Character 1: Please, just let me help you inspect it, let me pay for whatever needs fixing—I'll work here for free, anything, just [exhales] don't let that plane fly tomorrow.

Character 2: [coldly methodical] Get me the maintenance log from the office, then we're pulling every single panel off that aircraft tonight.

Character 1: You're not calling the FAA?

Character 2: Not yet—depends what we find in that engine compartment and whether you're telling me everything about what happened up there. [pause] Was there smoke?

Character 1: [quickly] No smoke, no visible damage, just that sound on descent, like metal on metal, lasted maybe ten seconds then stopped completely when I leveled out.

Character 2: That's classic bearing failure in the elevator trim system, which means we're looking at a complete tail section inspection. [grimly] This is a twelve-hour job minimum.

Character 1: [desperate whisper] I'll stay all night, I'll do whatever you need, I just couldn't let those people get on that plane without saying something.

Character 2: Grab the inspection lights from storage and pray we find the problem before dawn, because if we don't, [exhales heavily] your pilot's license is the least of your worries.

Character 1: [hollow] I know exactly what I've risked here—their lives, your reputation, everything—but keeping quiet would have been murder, wouldn't it?

Character 2: Murder requires intent; what you did was criminally stupid, but at least you came forward. [softer] Now stop talking and start working—we have six lives to save.

Character 1: [shaky exhale] Thank you for not just walking away or calling security—I know you have every right to destroy me over this.

Character 2: [firmly] I'm not doing this for you—I'm doing it for the family that chartered that flight, but after tonight, you never come near my hangar again. Understood?
