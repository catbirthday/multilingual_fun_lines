=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So it's you—the anonymous investor who's been circling our company for three months, sending those, um, those aggressive buyout offers through lawyers. [bitter laugh] Of course it's you.

Character 2: [quietly] Hello, Jamie.

Character 1: Don't—don't do that, don't say my name like you have any right to it after fifteen years of absolute silence. [voice shaking]

Character 2: [measured] I've been following your company's growth, the innovative platform you built from nothing—it's, uh, it's impressive work, truly impressive, better than anything I could've imagined.

Character 1: Oh, so now you're proud? Where was that pride when Mom was working three jobs to keep us afloat while you were, what, flipping luxury condos in Miami?

Character 2: That's not—[sighs] Look, I know how this looks, but I genuinely want to help, to invest properly, give you the capital to scale internationally.

Character 1: [sharply] We don't need your money, we're doing fine with actual investors who don't abandon their families for, um, for profit margins and beachfront properties.

Character 2: [defensive] It wasn't about the money, Jamie, it was never just about—I mean, your mother and I, we were destroying each other, you were too young to understand.

Character 1: [trembling] I was twelve, not stupid—I understood plenty when you chose your business empire over your actual family, when you literally packed your things during my birthday party.

Character 2: That timing was, uh, that was unfortunate, I admit that, but staying would've made things worse for everyone, including you. [pause] Especially you.

Character 1: [quieter] You know what the worst part is? I actually built this whole company partly to, I don't know, to prove I didn't need anything from you, ever.

Character 2: And you succeeded—you've built something remarkable without me, which is exactly why I want to be part of it now, if you'll let me. [hopeful]

Character 1: [withdrawing] Being part of something means showing up when it's hard, not just when it's profitable or, um, convenient for your portfolio.

Character 2: You're right, absolutely right, and I can't undo the past, but maybe, just maybe, we could try something different going forward? [tentative]

Character 1: [long exhale] The board meeting is tomorrow at nine—if you're serious about this, you'll need to convince them, not me, that you're more than just another corporate vulture.

Character 2: I'll be there, and Jamie, I'll—I'll present the real proposal, not the aggressive one, the one where we're partners, where your vision stays intact.

Character 1: [softening slightly] Mom still asks about you sometimes, you know, even after everything—she'd probably want me to at least hear you out properly.

Character 2: [emotional] She does? I, uh, I think about her too, about both of you, more than you'd probably believe, especially lately.

Character 1: [firmly] Nine o'clock, conference room B—don't be late, because unlike fifteen years ago, I won't wait around wondering if you're actually going to show up.

Character 2: I'll be early. [pause]
