=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] I didn't know you worked here now, honestly I would have gone somewhere else if I'd known, but my usual place is booked solid for the next three weeks.

Character 2: [quietly] It's fine, David, I've been here since April. [pause] Just fill out the intake form and tell me what service level you want for the Accord.

Character 1: [awkwardly] Right, the full interior and exterior package, I guess. [clears throat] The coffee stain on the passenger seat won't come out no matter what I try.

Character 2: [professionally] That's from the road trip to Portland last summer, I remember when you spilled it trying to change the music while driving through that construction zone.

Character 1: [softly] You remember that.

Character 2: [quickly] Standard detail takes four hours.

Character 1: [wandering] Your hair is different, shorter, it looks good on you. [sighs] Sorry, I shouldn't have said that, I know we agreed to stay out of each other's lives.

Character 2: [firmly] The waiting area has coffee and WiFi if you're staying, or you can leave your number and we'll text when it's ready for pickup. [pause]

Character 1: I'll wait, if that's okay, I don't have anywhere else to be today and [exhales] maybe we could talk when you're on break or something.

Character 2: [withdrawing] I don't take breaks.

Character 1: [sincerely] Look, I know I messed everything up with us, moving for that job without really talking it through, assuming you'd just follow me to Seattle without asking what you wanted.

Character 2: [bitter] You made your choice, David, and now I'm here detailing cars instead of finishing my nursing degree because I spent all my savings trying to make long distance work. [shaky voice]

Character 1: I came back though.

Character 2: [very quietly] Six months too late, after I'd already rebuilt my whole life without you in it, after I learned how to sleep alone again and stopped checking my phone every five minutes.

Character 1: [regretful] The Seattle job was a mistake, the money wasn't worth losing you, losing us, and I think about that every single morning when I wake up in that empty apartment.

Character 2: [exhausted] Please don't do this here, not at my workplace where I have to see you and pretend everything is professional and fine when nothing about this is fine.

Character 1: [desperately] I still have that playlist you made me for the drive up there, the one with all the songs from our first year together, and I can't bring myself to delete it.

Character 2: [trembling] Your keys. [pause] Just give me your keys and go wait in the lobby, I'll handle your car myself so you don't have to deal with the other techs.

Character 1: [very softly] I never stopped loving you, Jen, I just got really good at pretending I did because the alternative was admitting I threw away the best thing in my life.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] The Accord will be ready at three, we'll remove the coffee stain and detail everything else, and after today please find somewhere else to get your car serviced. [long pause] Please.
