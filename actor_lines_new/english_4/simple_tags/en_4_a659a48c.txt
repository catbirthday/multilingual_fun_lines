Scenario: A successful music producer returns to their family farm to convince their aging father to sell the land to developers for his cancer treatment.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Dad, I know this isn't what you want to hear, but the developers are offering three times what the land is worth. [pause] This could pay for the best doctors, the best treatments, everything you need.

Character 2: [bitter] So you finally come home after eight years in Nashville and Los Angeles, and the first thing you want to talk about is selling four generations of our family's blood and sweat.

Character 1: [frustrated] That's not fair and you know it. [sighs] I came back because Mom called me about your diagnosis, about the bills piling up, about how you can barely work the fields anymore.

Character 2: [slowly] Your great-grandfather planted those apple trees with his bare hands after the Depression nearly killed us all. [very quietly] Every tree out there has a story you've apparently forgotten.

Character 1: [defensive] I haven't forgotten anything, I just live in reality where sentiment doesn't pay for chemotherapy or radiation treatments or whatever else the oncologist says you need but won't admit you can't afford.

Character 2: [firmly] I'd rather die here.

Character 1: [angry] Don't say that! [voice breaking] You think I spent fifteen years building my career just to watch you choose this dirt over your life? Over having more time with Mom, with me?

Character 2: [coughs] Time for what, exactly?

Character 1: [passionately] Time to actually know each other again, to fix whatever broke between us when I left for music school and you called me a traitor to everything this family built.

Character 2: [regretful] I was angry that night, watching you pack up your guitar and leave everything behind like it meant nothing. [exhales] Maybe I said things I shouldn't have said.

Character 1: [very quietly] Maybe?

Character 2: [warmly] You know, I still have that old upright piano your grandmother used to play, the one you learned on before you discovered guitars and synthesizers and all that modern noise you make now.

Character 1: [surprised] You kept it? [softly] After all the fights we had about me wasting my time on music instead of learning to properly run the combine or fix the irrigation systems?

Character 2: I tune it every spring, same as she did, hoping maybe someday you'd come back and play those old hymns she taught you. [long pause]

Character 1: [shaky voice] The developers want an answer by Friday, Dad, and the medical bills are already past due, so we need to make a decision about what matters most here.

Character 2: [sigh] What matters most.

Character 1: [pleading] Please, just consider it.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Your last album, the one that won all those awards, there was a song on there about watching sunrise over wheat fields. [pause] That was about this place, wasn't it?

Character 1: [crying while speaking] Every song I've ever written started here, in these fields, with your voice teaching me about seasons and soil and patience. [whispers] How am I supposed to let strangers tear all that down?

Character 2: [gently] Then don't, son. [very sincerely] We'll find another way, even if it means I don't get the fancy treatments, even if it means less time, at least it'll be our time on our land.
