Scenario: A brother visits his younger goth sibling who hasn't left their room in three weeks after being expelled from art school for a controversial performance piece involving real blood.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] Mom asked me to check on you since you haven't come out of your room in three weeks. [pause] The whole blood art thing at school really shook everyone up.

Character 2: [bitter] Of course she sent you, couldn't face the family disappointment herself. [sighs] It was performance art, not some satanic ritual like the dean kept implying to justify the expulsion.

Character 1: [gently] I brought you those black sesame mochi you like from that place downtown. [clearing throat] Figured you might want something besides whatever instant noodles you've been surviving on up here.

Character 2: [defensively] You don't understand what I was trying to express with that piece. [frustrated] Using my own blood was about vulnerability, about literally putting myself into the work, not shock value.

Character 1: [warmly] I saw the video before they took it down, actually thought it was powerful. [quietly] The way you painted those self-portraits while the blood mixed with the oils was genuinely haunting.

Character 2: [surprised] You watched it? [softer] Nobody else in the family even tried to understand what I was doing, they just heard 'expelled for blood ritual' and made up their minds.

Character 1: [confidently] Look, I talked to my friend who runs that gallery on Newbury Street. [pause] She's interested in seeing your portfolio, said controversial artists often make the best exhibitions.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Oh great, another normie space that'll want me to tone everything down. [exhales] They always say they want edge until they actually see what darkness looks like on canvas.

Character 1: [firmly] This gallery hosted that photographer who documented decomposition cycles last year, remember? [chuckles] They're not exactly squeamish about unconventional art forms or challenging subject matter.

Character 2: [curious] Wait, the one with the time-lapse decay series? [animated] I stood in that exhibit for three hours studying how she captured beauty in entropy and dissolution.

Character 1: [relieved] There she is.

Character 2: [very quietly] I'm scared, okay?

Character 1: [empathetically] Being expelled doesn't define your worth as an artist. [sighs] Some of the greatest creators were rejected by institutions that couldn't comprehend their vision at the time.

Character 2: [melancholic] It's not just the expulsion, it's feeling like I crossed some line I can't uncross. [pause] Like maybe I went too far this time, even for me.

Character 1: [reassuringly] You've always pushed boundaries, that's what makes your work matter. [warmly] Remember when you painted that mural on the garage and Dad almost had a heart attack before realizing how incredible it was?

Character 2: [laughs quietly] He made everyone who visited look at it for six months straight. [nostalgic] Kept saying his kid was going to be the next Basquiat, just with more skulls.

Character 1: [playfully] So what do you say, ready to scandalize some gallery patrons? [chuckles] I'll even wear all black to the opening if that helps maintain your reputation.

Character 2: [mocking] You in all black would be the real performance art here. [sighs] But yeah, I'll put together a portfolio, just don't expect me to compromise my aesthetic.

Character 1: [sincerely] I wouldn't want you to compromise anything. [pause] Your darkness is what makes your art honest, and that's rarer than any degree could ever validate.

Character 2: [softly] Thanks for not giving up on me when everyone else did. [emotional] Maybe I'll actually eat those mochi instead of letting them melt into the growing collection of untouched care packages.
