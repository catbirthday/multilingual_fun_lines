=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Oh god, uh, Jamie? I didn't—I mean I had no idea you were doing this tour guide thing now, I just saw the sign and thought, you know, killing time might be nice.

Character 2: [strained] Everyone, we'll be starting in just a moment, please gather round the fountain. [very quietly] What the hell are you doing here, Alex?

Character 1: [defensive] I'm taking a tour, obviously. Look, I didn't know you'd be—[sighs] I can leave if this is too weird for you.

Character 2: [firmly] No, you paid for the tour, you can stay. [clearing throat] Just, um, try to blend in with the other tourists, okay? This is my actual job.

Character 1: [bitter] Right, your actual job. Because what I do isn't real work, is that what you're getting at here? Same old judgment, just a different venue.

Character 2: [exhausted] Not now, Alex.

Character 1: [quietly] You haven't returned my calls for three years, Jamie. Mom keeps asking about you and I have to make up excuses about why you won't come to Sunday dinners anymore.

Character 2: [frustrated] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the historic district walking tour! [forced cheerfulness] We'll be exploring three centuries of architecture and, uh, some fascinating stories about our city's founding families today.

Character 1: Really? You're just going to start the tour and pretend I'm not here? [laughs bitterly] Classic avoidance technique, very mature of you.

Character 2: [loudly] As we move to our first stop, please stay with the group. [whispering] Stop making a scene or I swear I'll have security escort you out.

Character 1: [sarcastic] Oh that's rich, you threatening to have me escorted. The irony isn't lost on me, believe me. Maybe we should talk about what really bothers you about my profession.

Character 2: [shaky voice] It's not about judgment, Alex. It's about watching my sibling put themselves in danger every night while I can't do anything to help or protect them.

Character 1: [softly] Jamie, I'm careful, okay? I screen clients, I have a panic button, there's a whole system in place. It's actually safer than you probably think it is.

Character 2: Is it though? [pause]

Character 1: [sighs] Yeah, it is.

Character 2: [trembling] Remember when we were kids and you'd always jump off the highest rocks at the quarry? I'd stand there terrified, watching, certain you'd crack your skull open one day.

Character 1: [warmly] But I never did, did I? I always knew how to land, how to judge the distance. [gently] This isn't that different, Jamie—I know what I'm doing.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] The limestone building on your left dates from 1887. [voice breaking] Sorry folks, just, um, allergies acting up today. The building served as our city's first proper hospital.

Character 1: [empathetically] Hey, maybe we could grab coffee after your tour? Like actually talk instead of just, you know, trading voicemails with Mom as our go-between? I miss you, Jamie.

Character 2: [very quietly] I miss you too. [clearing throat] Coffee sounds good, yeah. The tour ends at four-thirty, there's a place around the corner that still makes those weird lavender lattes you like.
