        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[very calmly] Those dedications are generated by my publisher's marketing team based on purchase data and reader demographics, nothing personal. [pause] Look, I appreciate devoted readers, but this is making me uncomfortable."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[passionately] No, no, you're lying to protect what we have from people who wouldn't understand! [laughs] The seventeenth word of every third chapter in your last book spells out a message—I decoded it, I know what you're really saying to me."

            "role": "Character 1",

        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[shaking] Love doesn't involve breaking into buildings or stealing private information or following someone without their consent. [exhales] You've turned something that should be beautiful—the relationship between writer and reader—into something genuinely frightening."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[menacingly] The others who didn't appreciate true dedication, who called it unhealthy when it was actually the purest form of admiration. [coldly] But they learned eventually that rejecting someone like me has consequences they never anticipated."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[terrified] Are you threatening me right now? [stuttering] Because I'm recording this entire conversation on my phone, and whatever happened with these mysterious 'others' you're talking about sounds like something the authorities need to know about immediately."
