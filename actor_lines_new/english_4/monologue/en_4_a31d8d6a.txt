Subject: The production sound mixer work you did capturing the perfect audio for an Oscar-winning film

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Nobody tells you how much of sound mixing is just... waiting. [pause] Waiting for the perfect take, waiting for that plane to pass overhead, waiting for the neighbor's dog to stop barking. [chuckle] But that day in the desert scene—God, that was something else. [passionately] We had maybe three minutes before the wind picked up, and I'm crouched there with the boom, my arms are shaking, and the actor's whispering this monologue that's gonna destroy people in theaters. [anxious] And I'm thinking, please don't let me mess this up, this is the one, this is the take. The director's giving me this look like, um, like "you got it, right?" [nervously] And I'm nodding but inside I'm terrified because there's this tiny rustling from the costume that I can hear in my headphones. [long pause] But then I played it back. [relieved] Crystal clear. Every breath, every tremor in his voice—it was all there. [very quietly] When they announced the Oscar, I was sitting on my couch in my pajamas. [laugh] My mom called crying. She doesn't even know what a boom operator does, but she knew, she knew this meant something. [warmly] Twenty years of people telling me to get a real job, and now my work is, uh... it's part of cinema history. [very sincerely] That desert scene still gives me chills.
