Subject: Finding out your teenage child has been selling their prescription medication to classmates for months

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] The principal called me at work. About pills. About— about you selling your Adderall to other kids. [pause] For months, she said. Months. [angry] How could you— no, wait, that's not even the right question. [shaky voice] I keep thinking about all those mornings, watching you take your medication before school. Were you even taking them? Were you just... pretending? [upset] God, I'm such an idiot. All those times you asked for early refills, said you lost them or— or left them at dad's house. [bitter] And I just believed you. Every single time. [pause] What were you thinking? [furious] These aren't candy, these are controlled substances! You could get expelled. You could get arrested. [very quietly] You could have hurt someone. What if— what if one of those kids had a bad reaction? What if someone's heart— [trailing off] [sigh] I don't even know who you are right now. My kid, my baby, is a drug dealer? [crying while speaking] That's what you are now. That's what this makes you. [pause] And I failed you somehow, didn't I? I must have. Because kids with good parents don't, um... they don't do this. [very sad] We're going to have to tell your doctor. The school. Your father. [hesitantly] How much money did you make? Actually, no— I don't want to know.
