[pause] I just got the email—they approved everything, full disability rating, retroactive payments, the whole thing. [extremely happy] This is huge. This is so huge for him. [sigh] You know, I've been doing this job for what, seven years now? And sometimes you get these cases that just... they stick with you. [empathetically] This guy served three tours, came back with traumatic brain injury, PTSD, can barely sleep through the night. His wife told me he, um... he hasn't been able to work since 2019. [very sincerely] And the system kept failing him, you know? Denial after denial. [frustrated] I mean, how many medical records does someone need to prove they're suffering? [pause] But we got it. We finally got it. [warm] I keep thinking about when I call him tomorrow—he doesn't know yet. He's probably sitting at home right now thinking it's another rejection coming. [chuckle] God, I love this part. When I get to tell them their life is about to change. [quietly] Twenty-two veterans a day, that's the statistic that haunts me. Twenty-two. [passionately] But not him. Not on my watch. [smiling speaking] Tomorrow morning, I get to tell him he's getting the help he earned."
