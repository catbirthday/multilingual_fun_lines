I keep refreshing the credits thinking maybe—maybe I missed my name somehow, but no. [pause] Everyone kept telling me this was it, you know? \"This is your big break, this is going to change everything.\" [laugh] Yeah, right. The producer even pulled me aside during post and said my cityscape was the best digital environment work he'd seen in years. [frustrated] And now what, it's sitting on some hard drive somewhere? I mean, I get it, the whole third act got rewritten, but they could've used something. [sigh] My parents already told everyone about the movie. My mom bought tickets for opening night. She doesn't even understand what matte painting is but she was so proud. [very sad] I don't know how to tell her I'm not in it anymore. The worst part is, um... the worst part is I turned down that Netflix series for this. [pause] Because this was supposed to be theatrical, you know? This was supposed to matter. [exhausted] I guess I just start over. Again."
