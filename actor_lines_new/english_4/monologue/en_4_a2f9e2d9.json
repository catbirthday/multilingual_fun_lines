And Jacob asked if I could help with his science project, which is just—I mean, he's never asked me for anything before. [quietly] The thing is, um... it's only because their mom died last month. [regretful] That's the only reason they're even looking at me now, you know? Like suddenly I'm not the evil stepmother anymore, I'm just... I'm all they have besides their dad. [bitter] Five years of trying everything—the cookies, the school plays, the trying-too-hard conversations—and nothing. [voice breaking] But now she's gone and they're, um... they're actually talking to me. [confused] How fucked up is it that I feel, I don't know, grateful? Not that she died, God no, but that maybe, finally... [trailing off] [sniffle] I watch them grieving and I just want to help but I also feel like such a fraud because, honestly? Part of me is relieved that I might actually get to be in their lives now. [very quietly] What kind of person does that make me?"
