Subject: Your visual merchandiser contract ended because the store is closing due to your display failures

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: They said it wasn't personal. [bitter] Can you believe that? The entire store is shutting down because of my displays, and it's not personal? [frustrated] I mean, I get it—the numbers don't lie. Sales dropped forty percent after I reorganized the front windows. [regretful] But nobody told me that minimalist wasn't what they wanted! [defensive] They kept saying "fresh" and "modern" and "clean lines," so that's what I gave them. 

[quietly] Maybe I should have noticed the customers walking past without stopping. [sad] Three months of people just... not caring. And I kept thinking, oh, it's um, it's just a slow season. [anxious] But deep down I knew something was wrong. The way Margaret looked at my holiday display—[trailing off] she didn't have to say anything.

[angry] You know what though? They hired me specifically to shake things up! [shouting] "We need someone bold," they said! [mocking] "Don't be afraid to take risks!" [pause]

[very sad] Twenty-three years that store was there. And I killed it in six months. [crying while speaking] All those employees losing their jobs because I thought I knew better than, um... than decades of tradition. [sniffle]

[whispering] I don't even know if I can do this anymore. [exhausted] Maybe I'm just not cut out for retail. [sigh]
