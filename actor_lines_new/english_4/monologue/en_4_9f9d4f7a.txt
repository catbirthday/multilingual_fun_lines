Subject: Your child's teacher saying your kid is the most respectful and helpful student they've had in years

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] I had to call you in today because I just— I needed you to know something about your child. [smiling speaking] In twenty-three years of teaching, I have never had a student quite like them. [pause] Yesterday, a new student joined our class, and without me even asking, your kid immediately offered to show them around, share their supplies, sit with them at lunch. [very sincerely] But that's not even the remarkable part. They do this every single day, with everyone. [emotional] When Mrs. Chen's arthritis was bad last week, I found your child staying after class to help her clean the whiteboards. [chuckle] They didn't even know I was watching. [passionately] Do you understand how rare that is? Kids don't just— they don't naturally think about others like this anymore. [pause] Or maybe they never did, I don't know. [very excited] But your child does! They hold doors, they pick up trash that isn't theirs, they help classmates who are struggling without making them feel bad about it. [sniffle] I'm sorry, I'm getting a bit emotional here, but it's just, um... it's been a really tough year for teachers. [relieved] And then a kid like yours comes along and reminds me why I do this job. [laughing] They even remind ME to say please and thank you sometimes! [very sincerely] Whatever you're doing at home, please keep doing it.
