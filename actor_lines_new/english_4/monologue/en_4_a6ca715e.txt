Subject: The background extra role where you learned enough about filmmaking to write a screenplay that just got optioned

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] They actually optioned it. My screenplay. The one I wrote on, um... on my laptop between takes while everyone else was scrolling their phones. [laugh] God, I must've been on what, fifty? Sixty sets? Just standing there in the background, pretending to have conversations, pretending to drink fake coffee. [excited] But I was watching everything—the blocking, the coverage, how they'd reshoot for different angles. [pause] I remember this one AD who caught me taking notes once and, er, she thought I was some kind of spy or something. [chuckle] I told her I was just... I don't know, curious? [warm] And she actually started explaining things to me. The one-eighties, the eye-lines, why they needed that extra take. [speeding up] All those fourteen-hour days suddenly became like film school, you know? Every setup was a lesson. [very sincerely] And now someone wants to actually make my story. [pause] The thing I wrote because I finally understood how to, mmm, structure it for camera, how to write what's actually shootable. [shaky voice] All those years of being furniture in other people's scenes... [laugh quietly] turns out I was learning how to build my own.
