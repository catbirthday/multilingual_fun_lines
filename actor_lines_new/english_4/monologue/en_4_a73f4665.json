You're actually asking me to be the godparent? [very sincerely] That's like, that's huge. I'm honestly kind of, um... I don't even know what to say right now. [emotional] This is probably the most important thing anyone's ever asked me to do. \n\nI keep thinking about all those nights we stayed up talking about, you know, what we wanted our lives to look like someday. [warm] And now you have this perfect little human and you're trusting me with—geez, that's a lot of responsibility, isn't it? [laugh] But also like... of course I'll do it. Obviously. Did you really think I'd say no? \n\n[shaky voice] I'm gonna cry. No, I'm already crying. This is ridiculous. I just—I love you guys so much, and I already love that baby more than I thought was possible. [sniffle] I promise I'll be the best godparent. Like, I'll spoil them rotten but also, you know, teach them important life stuff. [chuckle] Mostly the spoiling though. God, come here, I need to hug you right now."
