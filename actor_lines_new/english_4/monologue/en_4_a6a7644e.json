[pause] God, Grandma, how did you live like this? [sadly] I keep finding these little paths she made through everything, like— like tunnels between the rooms. The kitchen counter has maybe six inches of space where she must have eaten. Six inches. [frustrated] And the smell is just— [cough] it's not even bad exactly, it's just old. Everything is old. [softly] Found her wedding dress today though. Just sitting in a box on top of three broken televisions. Perfect condition. [warm] She always said she was saving it for me. [laugh] Guess she was saving everything else too, huh? The contractor said it'll take, um... at least three dumpsters just for the living room. [overwhelmed] Three. But then I found this photo album under all the— the chaos, and it's us at the beach when I was seven, and she looks so happy, and I just— [crying while speaking] I miss her so much. [sniffle] But I'm gonna fix this place up. Make it beautiful again. [determined] The way she would've wanted it if she could've— if things had been different. [pause] Tomorrow I tackle the basement."
