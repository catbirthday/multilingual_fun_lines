[frustrated] I mean, I get it—the numbers don't lie. Sales dropped forty percent after I reorganized the front windows. [regretful] But nobody told me that minimalist wasn't what they wanted! [defensive] They kept saying \"fresh\" and \"modern\" and \"clean lines,\" so that's what I gave them. \n\n[quietly] Maybe I should have noticed the customers walking past without stopping. [sad] Three months of people just... not caring. And I kept thinking, oh, it's um, it's just a slow season. [anxious] But deep down I knew something was wrong. The way Margaret looked at my holiday display—[trailing off] she didn't have to say anything.\n\n[angry] You know what though? They hired me specifically to shake things up! [shouting] \"We need someone bold,\" they said! [mocking] \"Don't be afraid to take risks!\" [pause]\n\n[very sad] Twenty-three years that store was there. And I killed it in six months. [crying while speaking] All those employees losing their jobs because I thought I knew better than, um... than decades of tradition. [sniffle]\n\n[whispering] I don't even know if I can do this anymore. [exhausted] Maybe I'm just not cut out for retail. [sigh]"
