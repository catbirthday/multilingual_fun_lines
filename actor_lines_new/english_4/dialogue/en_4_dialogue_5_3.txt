=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Do you ever have those dreams where you wake up and can't tell if it was real?

Character 2: Oh god, yeah, constantly actually. Like, last week I had this dream where I, um, sent this really angry email to my boss, and I woke up in a complete panic checking my sent folder at like three in the morning.

Character 1: [high-pitched] Wait, you actually checked your email?

Character 2: [enunciating every word] I absolutely did check, and then I checked again because I was paranoid I'd somehow deleted it from my sent folder while half-asleep, which is, I mean, completely irrational but that's where my brain goes at three AM.

Character 1: That's kind of hilarious though.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, in retrospect it's funny, but at the time I was just lying there thinking, shit, did I really tell Karen from accounting what I actually think about her spreadsheet system? The relief when I realized it was a dream was, oof, intense.

Character 1: Do you get those a lot? The work anxiety dreams?

Character 2: Erhm, more than I'd like to admit, honestly. It's always either the angry email thing or, like, showing up to give a presentation completely unprepared and naked—which is so cliché but apparently my subconscious has no imagination.

Character 1: The naked thing is so weird. Why is that universal?

Character 2: Right? I read somewhere it's about vulnerability and fear of judgment, but I think it's just our brains being, um, weirdly literal about feeling exposed. Like, "Oh, you're worried about being unprepared? Here, be literally naked too, that'll really drive the point home."

Character 1: Mine are always about teeth falling out.

Character 2: Dang, those are the worst! I get those too sometimes and they're so visceral, you know? You can actually feel them crumbling in your mouth, it's disgusting. Supposedly it's about, uh, loss of control or aging or something.

Character 1: Or maybe we just grind our teeth at night?

Character 2: Ha! Yeah, probably that too. My dentist keeps telling me I need a mouth guard but those things are so uncomfortable, I tried one and it made me dream I was, like, choking on a hockey puck.

Character 1: So the cure gave you worse dreams?

Character 2: [shouting] Exactly! It's like this horrible cycle where the thing that's supposed to help just creates new problems! I'd rather have crumbly teeth dreams than suffocation dreams, thank you very much!

Character 1: Have you tried those apps that are supposed to help with lucid dreaming?

Character 2: Oh man, yeah, I went down that rabbit hole for a while. Kept a dream journal and everything, but all it did was make me remember more of my weird dreams, which, erhm, wasn't exactly the goal—now I just have detailed memories of anxiety dreams about forgetting to wear pants.

Character 1: Did you ever actually achieve lucid dreaming though?

Character 2: Sort of? Once I realized I was dreaming and got all excited like "Yes! I can fly now!" but then I just, um, immediately woke up from the excitement. So technically successful but also completely pointless—story of my life, really.
