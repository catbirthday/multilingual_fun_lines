Character 1: This is an incredible exhibit. Are you the one who recorded all these testimonies?

Character 2: [laugh histerically] Oh god, no no no. I'm just, um, I'm reading them out today. Number 47,829. That was Mrs. Chen from Block 7. She used to sing to the children every morning, even when there was nothing to sing about.

Character 1: How long have you been doing this?

Character 2: Three years now, every Tuesday and Thursday. Number 47,830. Samuel Goldstein. He, uh, he saved thirty-two people by memorizing the guard rotation patterns. Sometimes I still dream about the ones we couldn't save, you know?

Character 1: [furious] Why do they make you read the numbers? Can't they just use the names?

Character 2: The numbers were all they gave us then, so that's what we preserve now. Number 47,831. Rachel Martinez. She was seventeen. Used to draw butterflies on the walls with charcoal she'd, mmm, somehow smuggle in. Said they reminded her that transformation was possible.

Character 1: Do you know any of these people personally?

Character 2: Some of them, yeah. Number 47,832. David Nkomo. He taught me how to stay human when everything around us was trying to make us forget we were. Actually, he's the one who convinced me to do this volunteer work.

Character 1: [cheerful] That must feel meaningful, keeping their stories alive like this.

Character 2: It's the least I can do, really. Number 47,833. Anna Petrov. Eight years old. She, um, she shared her last piece of bread with my daughter the day before... well. Some debts you can never repay, you just carry them forward.

Character 1: Your daughter, is she...?

Character 2: She made it out, thank God. Number 47,834. Dr. James Foster. He performed surgeries with kitchen knives and sewing thread, saved hundreds before they caught him. My daughter's actually a doctor now too, says it's because of him.

Character 1: These numbers, they're so precise. How did they keep track?

Character 2: [quickly] They were meticulous about their cruelty, documented everything. Number 47,835. Maria Santos. She organized an underground school, taught children mathematics using pebbles and dirt. Education as resistance, she called it.

Character 1: Do people ever ask you to stop? Say it's too heavy?

Character 2: Sometimes, but I think that's exactly why we need to keep going. Number 47,836. Benjamin Liu. He was, oh man, he was fourteen and played violin from memory every Friday night, just to remind us beauty still existed somewhere.

Character 1: [cry] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get emotional. My grandmother might be in these records.

Character 2: [bitter] Don't apologize for feeling. That's what they wanted to take from us, the ability to feel. Number 47,837. Sarah Okonkwo. She kept a mental calendar for five years, never missed a single day. Told us time still mattered, that there would be an after.

Character 1: What number was yours?

Character 2: 52,116. But I don't, um, I don't read my own. Someone else does that on Mondays. We all need someone to remember us properly, not just as numbers but as the people we fought to remain.
