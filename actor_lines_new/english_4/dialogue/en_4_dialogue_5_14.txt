=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Is that a jar of peanut butter in your bag?

Character 2: [over confidently] Oh absolutely, that's my emotional support peanut butter. Creamy, not crunchy, because I'm not a monster. You'd be surprised how many life crises can be solved with a spoonful of Skippy.

Character 1: That's not a real thing.

Character 2: Listen, I've seen people bring emotional support peacocks on planes, so honestly my peanut butter is practically conservative. Plus it's under three ounces—well, okay, it's sixteen, but who's counting?

Character 1: I am. I'm literally counting. That's my job.

Character 2: Right right, of course. Um, would it help if I told you it's actually medicinal? I have a severe case of, uh, sandwich deficiency. Very serious condition.

Character 1: Sir, please just put it in the bin.

Character 2: Okay but wait—what if I eat half of it right now? Then it's only eight ounces, which is basically almost three. Math is flexible when you're desperate.

Character 1: [confidently] Not how math works. Or security. Next you'll tell me the laptop is a sandwich press.

Character 2: Actually that's genius! No no, it's just a regular laptop that I definitely remembered to take out of my bag like you asked. Definitely. Absolutely. Maybe.

Character 1: [upset] You didn't take your laptop out?

Character 2: Mmm, see when you say it like that it sounds bad. But technically I was distracted defending my peanut butter's honor, so really this is a systemic failure of competing priorities.

Character 1: Just... take it out now. Please.

Character 2: [monotone] Roger that. Laptop out. Shoes off. Dignity surrendered. Dreams crushed. Peanut butter confiscated. This is basically performance art at this point, isn't it? Security theater at its finest.

Character 1: Are you done?

Character 2: Almost! Just need to remove my belt, my watch, my will to live—oh wait, already lost that in the parking lot. Forty dollars for two hours! Highway robbery!

Character 1: Is that a water bottle?

Character 2: [passionately] Oh come ON! That's my vintage 2019 conference water bottle! It has sentimental value! My startup died but this bottle survived! It's literally all I have left of my dreams!

Character 1: Empty it or toss it.

Character 2: Fine fine, I'll chug it right here like some kind of hydration gladiator. Nothing says freedom like frantically drinking lukewarm water while strangers judge your life choices. Bottoms up!
