=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [stuttering] I-I've been reading about this conscious capitalism thing. Is it just corporate PR or actually different?

Character 2: Oh, that's, um, that's actually a really complex question. The idea is essentially that businesses can, like, pursue profit while also serving all stakeholders—employees, communities, the environment—but yeah, the execution is where it gets messy.

Character 1: [sigh] But doesn't that just sound like what companies should be doing anyway?

Character 2: [passionately] Exactly! That's the whole point though—we've somehow normalized this idea that businesses exist only to maximize shareholder value, which is actually a relatively recent invention from the 1970s. Before that, companies routinely considered their broader social responsibilities, you know?

Character 1: So what changed in the seventies?

Character 2: Mmm, well, Milton Friedman wrote this super influential essay arguing that a company's only social responsibility is to increase profits. It basically gave corporations, uh, moral permission to ignore everything else, and Wall Street absolutely loved it.

Character 1: And conscious capitalism is trying to reverse that?

Character 2: [confidently] Pretty much, yeah. Companies like Patagonia or Costco show you can treat workers well, care about environmental impact, and still be wildly profitable—arguably more profitable long-term because you're not, er, constantly dealing with turnover or PR disasters.

Character 1: But how do you know if a company is actually doing it versus just talking about it?

Character 2: Oof, that's the million-dollar question right there. You've got to look past the marketing and check things like, hmm, are they actually paying living wages? Do their actions match their mission statements?

Character 1: Like those companies that donate to charity but pay minimum wage?

Character 2: [joking] Ha! Yeah, "We donated ten thousand to fight poverty!"—meanwhile they're creating poverty by paying their workers twelve bucks an hour. The math, uh, doesn't exactly add up there, does it?

Character 1: It feels like every company claims to be purpose-driven now.

Character 2: Oh absolutely, it's become this buzzword salad where everyone's "disrupting" something while "empowering communities" or whatever. Most of it is just, I mean, marketing departments got really good at co-opting the language.

Character 1: So is the whole movement just doomed then?

Character 2: Ehh, not necessarily—there are genuinely companies doing it right, but you have to, like, dig deeper than their About page. Look at their B Corp certification, check if they're employee-owned, that kind of thing.

Character 1: [confused] Wait, B Corp? What's that?

Character 2: [loudly] Oh man, B Corps are fantastic! They're basically companies that get certified for meeting really strict standards on social and environmental performance—it's like, um, the gold standard for proving you're not just greenwashing.

Character 1: [long pause] Huh. Why don't more companies do that then?

Character 2: Well, because it's actually really hard and expensive to get certified, and you have to, uh, open your books to third-party auditors. Most companies would rather just, you know, make a nice website about their "values" and call it a day.
