=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: How long have you been doing risk assessment?

Character 2: Seven years professionally, but honestly I've been hypervigilant about danger my whole life. Turns out childhood trauma makes you really good at spotting potential threats. Silver lining, I guess.

Character 1: That's a dark way to find a career.

Character 2: [cry loudly] Sorry, sorry. Sometimes it still hits me weird. I've been in therapy for three years now and still can't talk about the useful parts without feeling guilty for finding any value in it.

Character 1: You don't need to apologize.

Character 2: Thanks. Recovery taught me that everything serves a purpose eventually. My brain rewired itself to scan for danger, and now companies pay me to do exactly that for their systems.

Character 1: [confidently] Must be satisfying, turning pain into purpose.

Character 2: It really is. I catch vulnerabilities other people miss because I know what it's like when safety nets fail. Every risk I prevent feels like retroactively protecting the kid I was.

Character 1: What kind of risks do you usually assess?

Character 2: Mostly operational stuff—supply chain failures, cybersecurity gaps, human error probabilities. The boring disasters that nobody thinks about until they're drowning in them. I make contingency plans for contingency plans.

Character 1: Sounds like you plan for everything.

Character 2: [joking] Except for my ex showing up at Trader Joe's last week! Some risks you just can't mitigate. Had to abandon a full cart and everything.

Character 1: That's rough. How are you handling that?

Character 2: [anxious] Not great honestly. My sponsor says exposure is healthy but my nervous system disagrees. I've mapped fourteen different grocery stores by their escape routes now.

Character 1: [very excited] Wait, you actually map escape routes?

Character 2: For everything. Restaurants, movie theaters, even parks. It started as a trauma response but now it's just habit. I could evacuate this building blindfolded in under ninety seconds.

Character 1: That's actually incredible.

Character 2: My therapist calls it adaptive behavior. The hypervigilance that once kept me frozen in fear now helps me save lives and prevent millions in losses. Funny how that works out.

Character 1: Do you ever just relax?

Character 2: [speeding up] Define relax because I meditate while calculating statistical probabilities and do yoga while mentally reviewing emergency protocols so technically yes but also absolutely not.
