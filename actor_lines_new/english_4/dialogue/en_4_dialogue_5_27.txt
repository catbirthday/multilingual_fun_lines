=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Look, I've been calling for three weeks about this billing error. Three weeks. You people keep saying it's fixed but here I am again.

Character 2: Oh geez, three weeks? That's... that's absolutely ridiculous, I'm so sorry. Let me, uh, pull up your account right now and see what's actually going on because clearly something's been dropped here.

Character 1: [very excited] Every single month you charge me twice for the premium package! Every month! How is this still happening?

Character 2: Okay, so I'm seeing the... wait, hang on. Yeah, there's definitely duplicate charges here going back to, mmm, looks like August? Man, this should've been caught way earlier, I mean this is pretty obvious in your billing history.

Character 1: That's what I keep telling everyone but nobody listens. You're all reading from the same useless script.

Character 2: No no, you're absolutely right to be frustrated—this isn't, like, a script thing, this is genuinely messed up. I can see where previous reps issued refunds but they never actually fixed the root cause, which is, uh, honestly kind of embarrassing on our end.

Character 1: So what, you're going to tell me to wait another billing cycle? That's the answer I keep getting.

Character 2: Absolutely not. I'm actually escalating this right now to our, um, technical billing team—not the regular support, but the people who can literally go in and fix the code that's causing this. Should take maybe fifteen minutes tops while we're on the call.

Character 1: I've heard that before too. You realize I've spent hours on this? Hours of my life I'm never getting back.

Character 2: Yeah, and that's... look, I know saying sorry doesn't give you those hours back, but I'm looking at your call logs here and, woof, seven calls about the same issue? That's completely unacceptable, like, somebody should've owned this problem way before now.

Character 1: Exactly. And I want compensation for all this wasted time, not just the refunds.

Character 2: Oh, for sure, we're definitely talking compensation here. So beyond the full refunds—which, let me calculate, comes to about eight hundred forty dollars—I'm also authorized to add, mmm, probably three months of free service for the inconvenience.

Character 1: Three months? After what you've put me through? That's insulting.

Character 2: Okay, you know what? You're right. Let me, uh, let me actually check what the maximum I can do is because honestly, this is one of the worst billing situations I've seen. Give me just a second here...

Character 1: And I want this in writing. Everything you're promising. Because your company has a credibility problem.

Character 2: [passionately] Absolutely, yes! I'm actually drafting an email right now with everything—the full refund amount, six months of credit which is, er, the maximum I can authorize, plus a direct line to my supervisor if this ever happens again because this is just ridiculous!

Character 1: [very slowly] Six months... okay, that's more reasonable. But how do I know this actually gets fixed permanently?

Character 2: [delighted] Oh! Actually, perfect timing—I just got confirmation from the technical team that they found the issue! It was a, uh, legacy flag on your account from an old promotion that kept re-triggering. They've completely removed it, so this literally cannot happen again.

Character 1: Fine. But if I see one more duplicate charge, I'm switching providers and posting about this everywhere.

Character 2: [shouting] No, totally fair! And honestly, if this happens again after everything we've just fixed, I'd probably help you write that review myself because at that point we'd deserve it!
