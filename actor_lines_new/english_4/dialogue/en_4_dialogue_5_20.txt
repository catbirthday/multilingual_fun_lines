=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You look like you're having one of those days. The coffee help at all?

Character 2: You have no idea. Twenty-five kindergarteners decided today was the perfect day to test every single boundary known to mankind. We had glitter explosions, someone tried to flush their sandwich, and I'm pretty sure I still have Play-Doh in my hair somewhere.

Character 1: [friendly] That actually sounds kind of amazing though. Chaotic, but amazing.

Character 2: It's definitely never boring, that's for sure. This morning one kid asked me if clouds were made of cotton candy and when I explained water vapor, she just looked at me and said "Miss Sarah, you're wrong" with such conviction I almost believed her.

Character 1: How do you even argue with that logic?

Character 2: You don't. You just nod and move on because five-year-olds operate on a completely different plane of reality where dinosaurs still exist somewhere and vegetables are a government conspiracy.

Character 1: Is that why you're drinking what looks like the world's largest latte?

Character 2: This is actually my second one today. The first one got knocked over during our impromptu dance party to calm everyone down after the great crayon war of Tuesday morning. Yes, that's a real thing that happened.

Character 1: [laugh] The great crayon war? I need to hear this story.

Character 2: [apologetic] Oh god, I'm doing that thing where I word-vomit my entire day on unsuspecting strangers. Teachers are terrible about this because we spend all day talking to tiny humans who think we live at school and have no other life.

Character 1: No, seriously, I want to know about the crayon war. This is the best conversation I've had all week.

Character 2: Well, it started when Emma claimed that purple was objectively better than orange, and then Tommy took personal offense because his mom's car is orange, and suddenly we had two faction leaders recruiting soldiers for their color armies.

Character 1: [over confidently] I could totally handle kindergarteners. How hard could it be? They're tiny.

Character 2: That's what everyone thinks until they're surrounded by twenty-five of them asking different questions simultaneously while someone's crying about their broken cookie and another one's trying to eat glue because it smells like strawberries.

Character 1: Wait, they make strawberry-scented glue? That seems like terrible planning.

Character 2: [flirtatious] Right? Though I have to say, you're taking all this surprisingly well. Most people's eyes glaze over when I start talking about my classroom adventures. You've got kids or just naturally patient?

Character 1: Neither actually. Just genuinely fascinated by anyone who can wrangle that many small humans and still form complete sentences by the end of the day.

Character 2: The secret is lots of coffee and remembering that everything they do, no matter how insane it seems, makes perfect sense in their little worlds. Like today, a kid put googly eyes on his apple because "it needed to see where it was going" into his mouth.

Character 1: That's actually kind of brilliant. Why shouldn't food have eyes?

Character 2: Exactly! See, you get it. That's the kind of thinking that would make you survive approximately three hours in my classroom before you'd need to go lie down in a dark room and question everything you thought you knew about logic and reason.
