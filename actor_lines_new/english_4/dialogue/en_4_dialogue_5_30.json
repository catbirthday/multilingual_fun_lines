So like, instead of starting with \"Step one: gather materials,\" you open with something like \"Remember that time you tried assembling furniture and ended up with three extra screws?\" It's about, you know, creating that immediate connection before you even get into the actual steps."

Plus, I mean, have you ever noticed how IKEA instructions use zero words and everyone still gets confused? There's definitely a balance there."

Plus you add those little, um, reassurances like \"this part's tricky for everyone\" or \"don't worry if it looks wrong at first\"—things that keep people from rage-quitting halfway through."

Most readers skim anyway, so like, why frontload all the technical specifications when they just want to know if they need a Phillips or flathead screwdriver, right?"

I once watched my mom try to follow my guide for setting up a router and, jeez, I'd assumed people knew what an ethernet cable was, which apparently was wildly optimistic."

But um, that's actually when I learned that every how-to guide needs a glossary, even for \"obvious\" terms, because what's obvious to you after researching something for weeks is, er, completely foreign to someone encountering it for the first time, you know?"
