=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [overly polite] Oh, you're Frank Delacroix from the broadcasts, aren't you? My husband watches you religiously every Sunday, says you're the only one who really understands the game.

Character 2: [friendly] That's very kind of him to say, and you must be Victoria Ashford. I've seen you at several league events, though we've never been formally introduced until tonight.

Character 1: [curious] It's interesting that you'd remember me from those events, considering how many people must blur together in your line of work. Do you always have such a good memory for faces?

Character 2: [slowly] Well, certain people tend to stand out, especially when they're connected to prominent team owners. Your husband's involvement with the league has been quite newsworthy lately.

Character 1: [very quietly] Newsworthy is such an interesting choice of words. [pause] I suppose everything my husband does becomes public property in your world, doesn't it?

Character 2: Public property is a bit strong, but when someone owns a team, their business dealings do become matters of public interest. [clears throat] Speaking of which, I've been meaning to ask someone close to the situation about those offshore accounts.

Character 1: [confused] Offshore accounts?

Character 2: The ones linked to the betting syndicates in Malta and Cyprus. [pause] Surely you must have noticed the late-night phone calls, the sudden trips to Vegas that don't align with any games?

Character 1: [bitter] You know, for someone who's supposed to be analyzing plays and statistics, you seem awfully interested in analyzing my marriage.

Character 2: I'm not analyzing your marriage, Mrs. Ashford. I'm investigating a story that could fundamentally alter how people view the integrity of the sport we all claim to love.

Character 1: [monotone] And what exactly do you expect me to say to that? That I'll help you destroy everything my husband built because you have some noble journalistic mission?

Character 2: [empathetically] I don't expect you to say anything, actually. But I thought you deserved to know that this story is coming out, with or without your cooperation, probably within the next two weeks.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Two weeks. [laughs] That's barely enough time to transfer assets or arrange separate legal representation, not that I'm thinking about such things, of course.

Character 2: Of course not. Though if someone were thinking about such things, they might also want to know that the FBI has already frozen several accounts as of this morning.

Character 1: [very quietly] You're not really here for the charity gala, are you? This whole conversation, meeting me here where he can't interfere, it's all calculated.

Character 2: [sincerely] The gala invitation was legitimate, but yes, I hoped we might talk. You're not just a trophy on his arm, Victoria, despite what everyone assumes.

Character 1: [coldly] Everyone assumes correctly. I knew exactly what I was signing up for five years ago, and I've played my part perfectly. [pause] The question is whether you're offering me a different role.

Character 2: Protected source status, full immunity, and a chance to control your own narrative for once. [quietly] My producer has the paperwork in her car if you're interested.

Character 1: [hesitantly] Your producer just happens to have FBI cooperation agreements in her car at a charity gala. [sighs] I suppose I should ask what happens if I simply walk away right now.

Character 2: [warmly] Then you walk away, and in two weeks you'll watch your life implode on national television while I provide color commentary. But somehow, I don't think that's what you're going to do.
