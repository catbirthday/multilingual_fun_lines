Scenario: After the problem student gets suspended for fighting, the strength coach who witnessed the incident offers to train them as an alternative to expulsion.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're the coach who stopped the principal from calling the cops. Why would you do that? Everyone else thinks I'm just a lost cause anyway.

Character 2: Because I saw what actually happened out there. You weren't just fighting to fight. [firmly] That kid had three friends backing him up and you still held your ground protecting that freshman.

Character 1: [defensively] I wasn't protecting anyone, I just hate bullies. My dad was one, so I know what they look like. [quieter] Besides, getting suspended doesn't change anything.

Character 2: You've got raw power but zero discipline. [passionately] That combination either destroys you or, if you channel it right, makes you unstoppable. I'm offering you a choice here.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Let me guess, you want to save me with some motivational speech about how lifting weights will fix all my problems? [bitter laugh] I've heard it before, coach.

Character 2: [sternly] No speeches. Just work. [pause] Five AM, every morning before school, you show up at my gym or you're expelled. The principal already agreed to it.

Character 1: [shocked] Five AM? Are you insane? I don't even wake up for first period half the time! [groans] This is worse than detention.

Character 2: [firmly] Exactly the point.

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, but I'm not some project you can fix. [sighs] My mom already tried therapy, anger management, all that stuff.

Character 2: [calmly] I'm not trying to fix you.

Character 1: [confused] Then what's the point of all this? Why waste your time on someone who's probably going to screw it up anyway? Everyone else has given up.

Character 2: [authentically] Three years.

Character 1: [curious] Three years what? [pause] Is that how long you think this will take, because I'm only stuck at this school for two more years.

Character 2: [quietly] Three years ago I was you. [slowly] Different story, same anger, same feeling that the whole world was against me. Then someone taught me that strength isn't about fighting everyone.

Character 1: [skeptically] And now you're what, trying to pay it forward? [sighs] That's a nice story but we're not the same person, coach.

Character 2: [intensely] You're right, we're not. [pause] You're angrier than I was, and that means you've got more fuel to burn. Question is whether you'll use it to build something or just watch yourself burn out.

Character 1: [hesitantly] What if I show up tomorrow and I can't do it? What if I'm not strong enough for whatever torture you've got planned?

Character 2: [confidently] Strength isn't where you start, it's showing up when you think you can't. [firmly] Five AM. Don't make me come looking for you.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll try it for a week. [mumbling] But if you make me do burpees, I'm out. I hate those things more than I hate waking up early.

Character 2: [chuckles] First exercise tomorrow is burpees. [warmly] Hundred of them. Welcome to the beginning of knowing what you're actually capable of, kid.
