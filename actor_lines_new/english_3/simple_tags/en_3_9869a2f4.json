            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[hesitantly] Actually, I'm here for more personal reasons than professional ones. [quietly] My father designed this building before the accident, and I recently found his original sketches with notes about a hidden vault system he never told anyone about."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[confused] A vault system? [slowly] The permits I saw twenty years ago only mentioned standard display cases, nothing about secure storage for anything valuable or dangerous."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[anxious] That's what's strange about it—these weren't in the official plans at all. [clears throat] The notes reference something about protecting a specific collection piece, a prototype weapon from the 1800s. [pause]"

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "Wait, are you talking about the Forsyth scent-bottle lock prototype? [gasps softly] That piece went missing from the donor's estate right before the museum project collapsed, everyone assumed it was stolen."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[very quietly] My father's notes suggest he knew where it was, maybe even had it. [sighs] The vault dimensions match the case specifications for that exact piece, down to the millimeter."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[very sincerely] I've spent twenty years studying antique firearms and their history, and that Forsyth prototype was revolutionary. [quietly] It was worth killing for, if someone knew what it really was."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[empathetically] Then we finally get answers to questions we've both been carrying for two decades. [firmly] Your father and my mentor deserved better than being written off as an accident."

            "content": "[warmly] Look, I know we just met, but we're probably the only two people who still care about what happened here. [hesitantly] Maybe they left us something to find, something they died trying to protect."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[passionately] The radar is showing a cavity exactly where the vault should be, about eight feet down. [excited] There's definitely something constructed down there, metal framework, concrete reinforcement—this is real."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[quickly] We need to be careful though—if someone killed them to get to that prototype, they might still be watching this place. [anxious] Twenty years is nothing for a collector obsessed with a piece like that."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[stern] You're right, but I'm not walking away now. [confidently] I've got connections who can help us excavate this quietly, people who understand the historical significance and won't ask too many questions."
