Scenario: After three years of virtual dating, a long-distance partner surprises their reluctant love interest at their workplace, having flown across the country without warning to finally meet in person.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] Hi Alex, it's me, it's really me standing here in your actual office after three years of video calls and messages. [pause] I know I should have told you I was coming but I was afraid you'd tell me not to.

Character 2: [very quietly] You flew here from Portland without asking me? [long pause] This is my workplace, Jordan, where my colleagues are watching us right now through the glass walls wondering who you are.

Character 1: [desperately] I told them I was a client interested in your marketing services, which isn't entirely untrue since I do need help with my business. [shaky voice] Please don't look at me like I'm some kind of stalker, we've shared everything for three years.

Character 2: We've shared carefully curated versions of ourselves through screens, which is completely different from you showing up at my job unannounced. [coldly] This crosses so many boundaries we've discussed.

Character 1: [pleading] I know, I know it does.

Character 2: [frustrated] Then why did you do it? [sighs] We had an understanding about keeping things virtual until we were both ready, and you've just destroyed that agreement in the most public way possible.

Character 1: [quietly] Because I'm tired of being in love with someone who keeps finding excuses not to meet me. Every planned visit gets cancelled, every suggestion gets deflected. [pause] I needed to know if I was wasting my life on pixels.

Character 2: [firmly] That's not fair.

Character 1: [bitter] What's not fair is letting someone believe for three years that eventually you'll take the next step when you clearly have no intention of ever meeting them. [voice breaking] I've turned down actual relationships for you.

Character 2: [defensive] I never asked you to turn down anything for me, Jordan. Those were your choices based on your expectations, not promises I made. [exhales] The virtual space we created was perfect exactly because it had boundaries.

Character 1: [angrily] Perfect for you maybe, because you could control every aspect of how I saw you, when we talked, what we shared. [laughs bitterly] But I wanted something real, something where I could hold your hand without scheduling it three days in advance.

Character 2: [very quietly] You think this is real? [pause] Ambushing me at work, forcing this confrontation in front of my entire team, making me look unprofessional because I have to deal with personal drama in my conference room?

Character 1: [defeated] No, you're right.

Character 2: [coldly] I cared about you Jordan, I really did, but this isn't the person I thought I knew. [sighs] The person I knew respected boundaries and understood that some people need distance to feel safe enough to love.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] Distance to feel safe or distance to avoid feeling anything real at all? Because from where I'm standing, after three years, it looks like you've been using screens as walls. [pause] I just wanted to see if there was actually something behind them.

Character 2: [monotone] There was, but you've destroyed it by barging through instead of waiting for me to open the door. Some things can't survive being forced into the light before they're ready.

Character 1: [whispering] So what happens now? Do I just go back to Portland and pretend this never happened, go back to our scheduled video dates where we talk about everything except how we're never actually going to be together?

Character 2: No, I think we both know we can't go back to that after this. [very quietly] You've made it clear you need more than I can give, and I've apparently been cruel in letting you hope for something I'm not capable of providing.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Three years, Alex. Three years of good morning texts and falling asleep on video calls and planning a future that you never intended to show up for. [long pause] I guess I'm the fool for believing virtual love could become something more.

Character 2: [regretful] You're not a fool for believing in love, Jordan. [pause] You're just someone who loved the wrong person, someone who could only love you through a screen because that's the only way I know how to love without destroying everything.
