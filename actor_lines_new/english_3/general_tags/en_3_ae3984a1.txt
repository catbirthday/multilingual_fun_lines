Scenario: The set designer and production coordinator meet in the empty theater at 3 AM after learning their lead investor has pulled funding, leaving them 48 hours before opening night with half the set unfinished.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hollow] Look at this place—half the backdrop's still unpainted, the platforms aren't even secured, and now we're supposed to just what, miracle this into existence with pocket change?

Character 2: I've been calling everyone I know since midnight, trying to find someone, anyone, who might throw us a lifeline here. [exhales heavily] Nobody's answering anymore.

Character 1: We need at least thirty thousand just for materials, never mind the crew overtime we'd have to pay to get this remotely ready.

Character 2: The cast doesn't even know yet—they're going to show up tomorrow for dress rehearsal expecting a full set, expecting everything we promised them. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: [defeated] Three months of work.

Character 2: [wearily] I keep thinking about Sarah's face when she sees that her big scene's backdrop is literally bare plywood because we can't afford the scenic artist to finish it.

Character 1: [sinking into a chair] Maybe we should just call it now, send out the cancellation notices before people buy more tickets to a show that won't happen.

Character 2: [desperately] We can't—the theater's already taken deposits for next month's bookings based on our run, and if we cancel, they'll sue us for breach of contract.

Character 1: [laughs emptily] So we're trapped between putting on an embarrassment of a show or getting buried in legal fees we definitely can't afford either.

Character 2: [crumbling] My entire reputation is tied to this production, five years of building contacts and trust, and it's all going to collapse in forty-eight hours.

Character 1: You think I don't know that? This was supposed to be my breakthrough design, the one that finally got me noticed beyond community theater. [voice breaking] Now it'll just be remembered as a disaster.

Character 2: [exhausted] I've already maxed out two credit cards trying to keep the lights on here, literally, because the venue wanted payment upfront after hearing about the investor.

Character 1: [quietly] What if we stripped it down, made it minimalist on purpose, sold it as an artistic choice instead of admitting we're broke?

Character 2: [drained] The marketing's already out there showing the elaborate Victorian setting, and critics are expecting what we promised—we'd look like complete amateurs trying to spin this.

Character 1: [sighs] The wood we have might be enough for the essential platforms if we forget about the second level entirely and just work with what's already built.

Character 2: [hopelessly] Even if we manage that, we still need someone to run the lighting board since Marcus quit yesterday when he found out about the money.

Character 1: [emptily] I know the basics from tech week, could probably fumble through it if we simplify the cues down to just essential visibility lighting.

Character 2: [staring at the half-built set] Twenty-three investors said no, twenty-three, and the one who said yes pulled out after his lawyers reviewed our financials.

Character 1: [flatly] We should have seen this coming when the initial budget meetings kept getting pushed back, but we were so desperate to make it work.

Character 2: [barely audible] At least we tried, right? [long pause] That has to count for something when everyone's asking what went wrong.
