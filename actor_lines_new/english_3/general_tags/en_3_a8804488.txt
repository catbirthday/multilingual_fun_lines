Scenario: A captured enemy soldier is interrogated by a nationalist military officer who discovers the prisoner is actually from his grandmother's annexed village.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: They told me you were captured near the eastern checkpoint, but, um, your accent—that's not from across the border, is it? That's from Kravina village.

Character 2: [coldly] Kravina doesn't exist anymore, Colonel. You should know that better than anyone since your people, ahh, redrew the maps six months ago and renamed everything.

Character 1: [leaning forward] My grandmother was born in Kravina, used to make this specific bread with caraway seeds that I can still smell sometimes, and now you're sitting here wearing their uniform? [bitter laugh]

Character 2: Your grandmother would probably understand why some of us chose differently when the annexation happened, when we had to pick between, um, keeping our homes or keeping our principles.

Character 1: [quietly] You know what they're calling people like you back home? Traitors who sold their birthright for foreign promises that'll never materialize once this war ends.

Character 2: [steady] And what do they call people like you who arrest their own cousins and neighbors for refusing to sign loyalty oaths to a flag that wasn't theirs six months ago? Patriots?

Character 1: I'm trying to, erhm, understand how someone from our soil, our blood, ends up pointing rifles at us. Help me understand that logic.

Character 2: [exhausted] Logic? You want logic? Your nation swallowed my home, demanded we forget our language, our customs, and when we resisted, you called us insurgents. [sighs heavily] Where's the logic in that?

Character 1: [frustrated growl] We offered citizenship, protection, prosperity—everything your previous government couldn't provide, and this is how you repay that generosity? By joining them?

Character 2: Generosity. [hollow laugh] That's what you're calling it when soldiers kicked down doors at three in the morning looking for anyone who wouldn't hang your flag?

Character 1: Those were necessary security measures during the transition period, and, look, I'm not proud of everything that happened, but stability required certain, um, certain unfortunate actions.

Character 2: [voice rising] Unfortunate actions? My brother disappeared during your 'transition period,' and his wife still doesn't know if he's in some detention camp or just, just gone.

Character 1: [defensive] Every revolution, every unification has casualties—people who can't adapt to progress, who cling to old divisions that only weaken us all. Your brother chose his side.

Character 2: He chose to keep speaking our dialect at the market, that's all. [voice breaking] That was his revolutionary act that threatened your glorious unified state so much.

Character 1: [softer] Listen, I can, maybe I can check the detention records, see if he's—but you have to give me something first. The supply routes your unit uses.

Character 2: [bitterly] Ahhh, there it is. The nationalist's bargain—betray everyone else I care about for a chance to maybe learn about one. Some things don't change.

Character 1: This is bigger than your village grudges, don't you see that? We're building something that'll last generations, something our grandchildren will thank us for. [pleading slightly]

Character 2: [quietly defiant] My grandchildren, if I ever have any, will know I stood against an occupation, not for some grand vision built on, um, on conquered villages and disappeared brothers.

Character 1: [standing abruptly] You have until morning to reconsider. After that, well, enemy combatants who refuse cooperation don't usually get second chances in this facility. [pause] Think about your brother.

Character 2: [resigned whisper] I am.
