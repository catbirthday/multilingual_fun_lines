Scenario: A grieving woman accidentally summons a spirit guide while trying to contact her recently deceased mother through an internet ritual she found online.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled gasp] Wait, you're not—you're not my mother. The candles, the salt circle, I followed everything exactly from the website, so who are you?

Character 2: [gently amused] No, child, I am not your mother, though your grief called to me just as loudly as any proper summoning would have. [pause] Those internet rituals rarely work as advertised.

Character 1: [trembling] This was supposed to be simple, just light some candles and say the words and maybe hear her voice one more time, not—not whatever this is happening right now.

Character 2: Simple? Death is never simple, and neither is reaching across the veil, even when your heart is breaking with the weight of all those unfinished conversations. [softer] I understand why you tried.

Character 1: [defensively] You don't understand anything about what I'm going through, about how she died thinking I was disappointed in her choices, how the last thing we did was argue.

Character 2: [measured] I've guided thousands of souls through their grief, watched them claw at the edges of death trying to take back words they can never unsay. Your pain is unique, but not unprecedented.

Character 1: So what, you just float around waiting for desperate people to mess up occult rituals? [bitter laugh] Is this some kind of cosmic customer service for the bereaved?

Character 2: [wryly] Something like that, though most summonings don't involve sage bundles from Target and pronunciation this creative. You called for guidance, even if you didn't realize that's what you were really asking for.

Character 1: I wasn't asking for guidance, I was asking for my mother, for five more minutes to tell her that I loved her despite everything, that our fight didn't matter.

Character 2: [lingering sadness] She knows, child. The dead always know what the living wish they'd said—it's one of the first truths that comes with crossing over, that love transcends even our worst moments.

Character 1: [voice cracking] How can you possibly know that? You're just saying what you think I need to hear, like some ethereal grief counselor with a script for the pathetically unprepared.

Character 2: Because I spent my last mortal hours believing my own daughter hated me for leaving her too soon, only to discover after death that she'd forgiven me before I'd even taken my final breath.

Character 1: [stunned whisper] You were—you were human once? You actually died thinking someone you loved was angry with you, and then found out they weren't?

Character 2: [heavily] Three hundred years ago, yes. Tuberculosis took me while my daughter was at market, and I passed believing she resented me for being too sick to see her married. [exhales] I was so wrong.

Character 1: But how do you know my mother feels the same way? Maybe she really did die thinking I was this terrible, ungrateful daughter who criticized every choice she made.

Character 2: [firmly] Because I can feel her presence even now, hovering just outside this clumsy circle you've drawn, and all she radiates is love and worry for how you're torturing yourself with guilt.

Character 1: [desperately] Can you—can you let her through? If she's really here, if you can feel her, please, I just need to hear her say it's okay, just once.

Character 2: That's not how this works, child. The veil exists for a reason, and she's already moving toward her next journey. [gentler] But I can teach you to feel what I feel, that certainty of forgiveness.

Character 1: [defeated sigh] So this is it then? I summon a random spirit guide instead of my mother and get philosophy instead of closure? This whole thing really was pointless.

Character 2: [warmly persistent] Not pointless—misdirected perhaps, but your love created this opening between worlds, and that love is exactly what your mother felt even as she left this plane. That truth can be your closure, if you let it.
