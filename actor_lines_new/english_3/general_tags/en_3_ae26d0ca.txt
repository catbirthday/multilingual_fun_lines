=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [gently] Jamie, I, uh, I got your message at three in the morning, and honestly, the fact that you called me instead of... well, that tells me something important is still working inside you, you know?

Character 2: I don't even know why I called, it's not like you can fix this mess I've made, five years down the drain in one stupid night and now I'm just... [trails off]

Character 1: [firmly] Hold on, okay? Five years aren't erased by one slip, they're still yours, every single day you fought for them still counts, and I mean, this is exactly why we talk about recovery being a journey, not a destination.

Character 2: [bitter laugh] A journey? God, that's such bullshit, Marcus, I had a job, I had my kids back on weekends, I was actually somebody's sponsor, and now what am I supposed to tell them, huh?

Character 1: You tell them the truth, that recovery isn't perfect, that, um, sometimes we stumble but we get back up, and honestly, Jamie, the hardest thing you'll ever do is what you're doing right now, sitting here, talking to me instead of using again. [pause]

Character 2: [shakily] I already did though, last night after I called you, I went right back out and scored again because I figured, well, I already fucked up so why not just... why not just finish what I started, right?

Character 1: [measured] Because some part of you knows that's not who you are anymore, and look, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend this isn't serious, but, errr, you've survived worse than this relapse, remember where you were six years ago?

Character 2: Six years ago I was sleeping under the Morrison Street bridge and eating out of dumpsters, so yeah, [exhales] I guess technically I'm doing better than that, though it doesn't really feel like much of an achievement right now.

Character 1: Jamie, listen to me, every person I've ever worked with who made it long-term had at least one moment like this, and the ones who didn't make it were the ones who gave up after a slip, not the ones who slipped.

Character 2: [voice cracking] But how do I face my daughter, Marcus? She's thirteen now, she finally trusts me again, and I promised her, I swore on everything that I'd never... [chokes up]

Character 1: [softly] You face her with honesty.

Character 2: Honesty? Are you serious right now? Hey sweetheart, daddy's a junkie again, see you never because the court's definitely taking my visitation rights, that kind of honesty?

Character 1: [insistent] No, the kind where you tell her you're human, that you made a mistake but you're fighting to get back on track, and more importantly, Jamie, you show her that when people fall down, they can choose to get back up.

Character 2: [desperately] I don't know if I have another recovery in me, Marcus, like, this last one nearly killed me, the withdrawals, the meetings every day, rebuilding everything from nothing, I'm just so fucking tired of fighting.

Character 1: I know you're tired, God, I know, but here's what I also know: you called me, you showed up here, and somewhere under all that exhaustion and shame, there's still that fighter who walked into my office five years ago determined to live. [pause] That person hasn't gone anywhere.

Character 2: What if you're wrong though? What if that person died last night when I stuck that needle in my arm? What if I'm just, uhh, fooling myself thinking I can come back from this?

Character 1: [leaning forward] Then we'll find out together, but I don't think I'm wrong, because if that person was really gone, you wouldn't be here right now, crying about your daughter, worried about your sponsee, feeling the weight of what you might lose.

Character 2: My sponsee, Jesus Christ, Tommy's been clean for eight months and I'm supposed to meet with him tomorrow, what the hell am I supposed to say to him now?

Character 1: [thoughtfully] You know what? Maybe this is exactly what Tommy needs to see, that recovery isn't about being perfect, it's about being honest, and if you can show him how to handle a relapse with integrity, that might be the most valuable lesson you ever teach him.

Character 2: [quietly] You really think there's a way back from this? Like, actually back to where I was, not just... not just surviving but actually living again? Because right now, I can't see it, Marcus, I really can't.
