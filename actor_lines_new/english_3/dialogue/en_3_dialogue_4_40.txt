=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [upset] They just fired three people for talking about wages at lunch. That's not even legal, right?

Character 2: [gasp softly] Wait, what? No, that's literally protected under the NLRA—they can't do that, like, discussing wages is explicitly a protected activity and, um, honestly that's such a blatant violation they're basically begging for trouble.

Character 1: Should we do something about it? I feel terrible for them.

Character 2: Yeah so, we definitely need to document everything first—dates, witnesses, exact words if you remember them, because, er, that's gonna be crucial if anyone files with the NLRB, which they absolutely should do.

Character 1: I want to help but I'm scared they'll target me next.

Character 2: [sarcastic] Oh sure, because retaliating against someone for supporting their coworkers' legal rights would never backfire on them, right? Look, I get the fear but, honestly, the more people who stand together, the harder it becomes for them to pick anyone off.

Character 1: [animated] You know what, you're right! We should start organizing properly. Where do we even begin?

Character 2: Okay first thing is, uhh, finding out who else is pissed about this—start with people you trust completely, then expand carefully, and maybe, I mean, reach out to an actual union rep who can guide you through the process properly.

Character 1: [friendly] My cousin went through this at her warehouse job. Maybe she has contacts?

Character 2: Perfect! Yeah, personal connections are, like, way better than cold-calling unions, and she'll probably have insights about what worked and, er, what mistakes to avoid, which is honestly invaluable right now.

Character 1: How many people do we need to get on board realistically?

Character 2: Well look, you need thirty percent just to trigger an election, but ideally you want, mmm, like sixty or seventy percent committed before you go public, because support always drops once management starts their anti-union campaigns.

Character 1: [excited] Sarah from accounting already texted me saying she wants in! That's huge because everyone trusts her.

Character 2: [furious] Of course she does—they've been screwing over accounting for months with that "other duties as assigned" bullshit while refusing to adjust their pay! Having her on board is, frankly, gonna make this so much easier because she knows where all the bodies are buried.

Character 1: Should we meet somewhere outside of work to discuss this?

Character 2: Definitely, and, uhh, avoid company email or Slack for anything organizing-related—they monitor that stuff and, I mean, you want to keep everything off their radar as long as possible.

Character 1: What about the people who seem happy with how things are?

Character 2: Ahh, there's always fence-sitters, but most of them are just scared, not actually satisfied—once they see momentum building and, er, realize they won't be alone, a lot of them come around pretty quickly.

Character 1: I really hope we can make things better for everyone.

Character 2: [cough] We will, honestly, just the fact that people are finally talking about this stuff openly is already a victory—change doesn't happen overnight but, you know, every movement starts with conversations exactly like this one.
