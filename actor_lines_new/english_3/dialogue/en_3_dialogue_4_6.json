            "content": "Okay okay, so, forms—perfect example. Your basic HTML form should work without any JavaScript at all, then you layer on, I dunno, real-time validation, auto-complete, all that nice stuff for browsers that support it."

Screen readers sometimes struggle with JavaScript, corporate firewalls block it, some people disable it for privacy—there's like, millions of reasons. Plus, erm, JavaScript fails sometimes, you know? Networks drop, files don't load, it happens constantly."

Like, a link should actually link somewhere, a button should submit something. Then CSS makes it pretty, and JavaScript makes it, uhh, delightful or whatever you want to call it."

Progressive enhancement is basically future-proofing, making sure your stuff works everywhere, not just on the latest MacBook."

That's progressive enhancement done right, everything critical works, JavaScript just makes it, you know, smoother and faster."
