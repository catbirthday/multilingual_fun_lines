=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Why do we say "break a leg" for good luck? Seems pretty violent.

Character 2: [chuckle] Oh man, that's actually a fascinating one! The, uh, most likely theory is that it comes from theater superstition—actors believed wishing someone good luck would jinx them, so they'd say the opposite, kind of like reverse psychology.

Character 1: But why specifically legs?

Character 2: Well, see, there's this idea that it might refer to, hmm, bending your knee to take a bow after a successful performance—you know, "breaking" the line of your leg? Though honestly, nobody's totally sure about the exact origin.

Character 1: Do other cultures have weird good luck phrases?

Character 2: Oh absolutely! Germans say "Hals- und Beinbruch" which literally means break your neck and leg, and, uh, Italians sometimes say "in bocca al lupo"—into the wolf's mouth—which is pretty metal if you ask me.

Character 1: What's the correct response to that one?

Character 2: [sarcastic] Ah yes, because naturally you'd respond "crepi il lupo"—may the wolf die—because apparently having a full conversation about wolf murder is how Italians handle pre-performance anxiety. Totally normal stuff.

Character 1: Why are humans so superstitious anyway?

Character 2: Mmm, it's basically our brains being, like, really bad at statistics but really good at pattern recognition? We see connections that aren't there because, evolutionarily speaking, it was better to be paranoid than dead.

Character 1: Even smart people?

Character 2: Oh especially smart people! I mean, Newton spent more time on alchemy than physics, and, uh, Tesla was obsessed with the number three—wouldn't stay in hotel rooms unless the number was divisible by three.

Character 1: [child-like] But that's so silly! Three? Really?

Character 2: Right? And get this—he'd walk around buildings three times before entering them, used exactly eighteen napkins at dinner, that sort of thing. Brilliant mind, but absolutely convinced the universe ran on threes somehow.

Character 1: What's your weirdest superstition?

Character 2: [shy] Um, okay, this is embarrassing but... I actually knock on wood constantly? Like, even when I'm alone, I'll literally stop mid-sentence to find something wooden to tap, which is, yeah, completely irrational but here we are.

Character 1: [laugh loudly] You? The rational one? That's amazing!

Character 2: [belly laugh] I know, I know! Look, we all have our things, okay? At least I'm not avoiding cracks in sidewalks or, er, throwing salt over my shoulder every five minutes like some people I know.

Character 1: Who throws salt?

Character 2: My grandmother, actually—she goes through, gosh, probably a pound of salt a month just from the throwing alone, swears it keeps the devil away. Pretty sure her kitchen floor is essentially, um, a salt mine at this point.
