=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You're the one who rejected my fence proposal?

Character 2: I didn't reject it personally—the architectural review committee made that decision collectively. Your proposed height exceeded the neighborhood covenant by eighteen inches, and the material wasn't on the approved list.

Character 1: It was just a normal wooden fence!

Character 2: [joking] Cedar planks with decorative lattice work is hardly "normal" around here! The covenant specifically allows pressure-treated pine, vinyl, or wrought iron only. We've had these standards since 1987 to maintain that cookie-cutter suburban charm everyone loves so much.

Character 1: That's ridiculous. Who even decided these rules?

Character 2: The original developer established them, and homeowners vote on amendments every three years. You actually signed acknowledgment of these restrictions when you closed on your house—it was tucked into that mountain of paperwork nobody reads.

Character 1: Can't you make an exception?

Character 2: Setting precedents undermines the entire covenant structure. If we approve your non-conforming fence, the Johnsons will want their purple shutters, and suddenly the whole neighborhood looks like a box of crayons exploded.

Character 1: [curious] What if I repaint my whole house purple then?

Character 2: Don't even joke about that—Mrs. Henderson has informants everywhere and she'll file a violation before your first brushstroke. Paint colors require pre-approval through the same tedious committee process, and trust me, anything beyond beige-to-gray spectrum causes immediate cardiac events among board members.

Character 1: This is insane. You people have too much time on your hands.

Character 2: Actually, maintaining community standards protects everyone's investment here. Studies show that neighborhoods with active HOAs appreciate fifteen to twenty percent more than those without structured governance—boring but true.

Character 1: What if I just build it anyway?

Character 2: [confidently] Then you'll receive a cease-and-desist letter, followed by daily fines of seventy-five dollars. If you continue, we place a lien on your property. The covenant has real legal teeth, enforced through county court, and we absolutely will use them.

Character 1: Have you actually taken someone to court over a fence?

Character 2: Twice in my eight years on the board. Both times the homeowner ended up paying our legal fees plus their own, on top of removing the non-compliant structures. It genuinely breaks my heart every time but rules are rules.

Character 1: Fine, whatever. Can I at least have six feet if I use approved materials?

Character 2: [joking] Six feet of pressure-treated pine is completely within guidelines—look at us finding common ground! Submit the revised application by Thursday and we'll fast-track it through next Tuesday's meeting. See, we're practically anarchists compared to the Willowbrook HOA down the street.

Character 1: Do I need to use a specific contractor too?

Character 2: [very meekly] No, you can use anyone licensed and insured. We're not completely draconian, despite what the neighborhood Facebook group says about us. Just get those permits from the county first, please.
