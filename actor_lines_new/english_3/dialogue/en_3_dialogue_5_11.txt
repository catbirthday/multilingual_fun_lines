=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [very melancholic] Do you ever feel like time just... slips away from you?

Character 2: [regretful] Ah, yes. Yes! Time is—hmm—it's like water through fingers, isn't it? I measure moments in heartbeats sometimes; sixty... seventy... eighty per minute, and still they vanish before I can properly, um, catalog them.

Character 1: That's exactly it. I lost three hours today just staring at nothing.

Character 2: Three hours is... let's see... ten thousand eight hundred seconds. Each one existed! Each one had weight, texture—you weren't staring at nothing, you were processing, mm, everything.

Character 1: But I accomplished nothing. Literally nothing.

Character 2: Oh but accomplishment is such a—such a narrow lens! Your cells divided, neurons fired in patterns unique to this exact moment in spacetime; you were, uhh, magnificently busy being alive.

Character 1: [short pause] You have such a strange way of seeing things.

Character 2: Strange? Perhaps! I parse reality in... in fragments? Like—imagine consciousness as a prism, breaking experience into these infinite spectrums that most people, erhm, never notice.

Character 1: [empathetically] That sounds overwhelming honestly. How do you handle all that input?

Character 2: Mmm, I compartmentalize obsessively. Filing systems within filing systems! Though sometimes—eesh—sometimes the categories blur and I'll find myself sorting emotions by, by temperature or memories by their specific shade of blue.

Character 1: Wait, memories have colors for you?

Character 2: Everything has color! Words taste like—like cinnamon or steel or rain; numbers have personalities that shift depending on context. Seven is particularly temperamental on Tuesdays.

Character 1: You're either genius or completely insane.

Character 2: Ha! Both? Neither? I process at—at speeds that make categories feel, umm, inadequate. Sanity is just consensus anyway; who decided what patterns of thought qualify as "normal"?

Character 1: Fair point. What does my voice look like to you?

Character 2: Amber threads with... with silver interruptions. When you're sad—like earlier—it gets these violet undertones that, honestly, ripple outward in concentric circles.

Character 1: [shouting] That's incredible! Can you teach me to see like that?

Character 2: [warm] Oh, you already do—you just, mm, filter it out! Your brain receives the same data; mine just refuses to prioritize "practical" over "possible."

Character 1: [happy] I want to try. Where do I even start?

Character 2: Start with silence. Real silence. Let your thoughts scatter like—like starlings at dusk, then notice what patterns they make against the, uhh, the empty sky of your consciousness.
