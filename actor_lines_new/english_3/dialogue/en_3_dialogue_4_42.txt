Character 1: [trailing off] So the cross-cultural training module we're implementing next quarter needs to address the incident in Singapore...

Character 2: Oh right, yeah, I heard about that whole mess. Erm, from what I understand, it was basically a complete breakdown in understanding local business etiquette, right? Like, our team showed up forty minutes late to the first meeting and, sheesh, that basically torpedoed the entire relationship before it even started.

Character 1: [regretful] I should have caught that in the prep materials. We knew punctuality was critical there.

Character 2: [jealous] Well, I mean, Sarah's team in Tokyo never has these issues because she actually lived there for three years, so she gets all the nuances that, uhh, the rest of us are just guessing at from some PowerPoint deck.

Character 1: That's not helpful. We need systematic solutions, not just rely on individual expertise.

Character 2: [cough] Sorry, you're right, that was—anyway, I've been thinking we could maybe bring in actual consultants from each region? People who, you know, really understand the unwritten rules, not just the obvious stuff like "don't use your left hand" or whatever.

Character 1: How much would that cost? Budget's already stretched with the new LMS platform.

Character 2: [exhausted] Ugh, honestly? Probably like fifty, sixty thousand minimum if we want quality people, and that's just for, I dunno, maybe four or five key markets—Asia Pacific, Middle East, Latin America—and we'd still be missing huge chunks of the world.

Character 1: [very slowly] What if... we partnered... with our local offices... to create the content themselves?

Character 2: [very meekly] Um, well, I actually suggested that last year and, er, leadership kind of shot it down because they wanted "consistency across all materials" which, I mean, sort of defeats the whole purpose of cultural training but, yeah...

Character 1: But that was before Singapore. This changes the conversation entirely.

Character 2: [confidently] You know what? You're absolutely right. This incident gives us leverage we didn't have before—I can pull together a proposal showing how much that contract was worth, probably around eight million, and suddenly fifty grand for proper training looks like pocket change.

Character 1: [cheerful] Yes! And we can pilot it with just Asia Pacific first, prove the ROI, then expand.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, and actually, if we frame it as risk mitigation rather than, uhh, "cultural sensitivity" or whatever buzzword they're allergic to, the C-suite might actually listen this time.

Character 1: I'll draft the initial framework tonight. Can you get me those Singapore incident reports?

Character 2: Oh sure, I've got them all documented already, including, erm, some really cringeworthy emails where our guy kept insisting the client was being "too rigid" about time, which is just... yikes, you know?

Character 1: We should also include the Mumbai situation from last year. Similar root cause.

Character 2: [cry loudly] Oh god, don't remind me about Mumbai! That was—we literally served beef at the welcome dinner, and I just, I can't believe nobody caught that beforehand, it still makes me want to crawl under a rock thinking about their faces.

Character 1: It's fixable. We just need to build better systems, better checks and balances.

Character 2: Yeah, exactly. And honestly, once people see how, uhh, relatively simple most of these cultural considerations are—like basic research would prevent ninety percent of these disasters—I think they'll actually embrace the training rather than treating it like some HR checkbox.
