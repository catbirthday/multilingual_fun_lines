=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Let me see here... so you're telling me. I need seventeen different forms. For one warranty claim?

Customer Support: Right right. Yeah. I get it. Look, it's not ideal. But the warranty division at 2244 Industrial Park needs everything documented. For the claim number WR-9982-TK to process. They're strict.

Customer: I've been doing this for fifteen years. Fifteen. Never had to jump through these hoops before.

Customer Support: Absolutely. I hear you. The new system rolled out January 11th. More requirements now. Everything needs the... what's the word... the verification trail. All documented.

Customer: So the—wait, actually—how long is this gonna take once I submit everything?

Customer Support: Standard processing. Seven to ten days. But here's what I can do. Mark it priority. Code P447. Cuts it to maybe four days.

Customer: Hmm, what if... okay so that means I'm without the diagnostic tool for at least a week. My customers aren't gonna be happy about this.

Customer Support: Yeah. Not great. Tell you what though. While you wait. We have loaner units. Warehouse has three available. Model DT-55X. Almost identical specs.

Customer: I guess—no wait—will that affect my claim somehow? Like if I take the loaner?

Customer Support: Nope. Separate thing entirely. Loaner agreement LA-2910. Doesn't touch your warranty. Just need your shop license number.

Customer: I've been loyal to your brand since 2009. This is honestly making me reconsider.

Customer Support: I get it. Really. Been here six years myself. Seen the changes. Not all good. But between you and me? Once you're in the system. Next time takes five minutes. Promise.

Customer: Next time. Right. Because there's definitely gonna be a next time at this rate.

Customer Support: Look. I'm gonna note everything. Account flag AF-1122. Any future claims. They'll see you're verified. Speeds things up considerably.

Customer: Let me think... I mean, I sort of need this resolved. But seventeen forms is insane.

Customer Support: It's actually... hang on... checking here... it's really just eleven. Six are auto-filled. Takes maybe twenty minutes total.

Customer: Twenty minutes I don't have. But okay. Fine. Send them over.

Customer Support: Sending now. To the email on file. Also throwing in expedite code EX-5500. Just put that in box 14A. Helps push it through.

Customer: I probably shouldn't have to mention I spend forty thousand a year with you guys. But here we are.

Customer Support: Noted. All of it. Making sure dispatch at extension 7714 knows too. They'll prioritize your loaner delivery. Should have it by tomorrow 2PM.
