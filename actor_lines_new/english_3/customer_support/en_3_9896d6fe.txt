=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I need help with a duplicate order I accidentally placed this morning.

Customer Support: Good afternoon, and thank you for calling. I'd be happy to help you resolve the duplicate order issue. May I have your order confirmation number to get started?

Customer: I have two confirmation numbers. The first is RTL-8923-JK and the second is RTL-8924-JK.

Customer Support: Perfect, I can see both orders here. Order RTL-8923-JK was placed at 9:47 AM for the deluxe cookware set, and RTL-8924-JK at 9:52 AM for the identical item.

Customer: That's correct. I had trouble with the checkout page and didn't realize the first order went through.

Customer Support: I completely understand how that can happen. The good news is that order RTL-8924-JK hasn't been processed for shipping yet, so I can cancel it immediately and issue a full refund.

Customer: That would be wonderful. How long will the refund take to appear on my credit card?

Customer Support: The cancellation will be processed within the next 30 minutes, and the refund of $247.99 will appear on your statement within 3-5 business days depending on your bank's processing time.

Customer: Excellent. Will I receive confirmation that the second order has been cancelled?

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: And the first order will still arrive as scheduled?

Customer Support: Yes, your original order RTL-8923-JK remains unchanged and will be delivered Thursday, October 19th between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM as originally scheduled.

Customer: That's perfect timing. I'm getting this as a gift for my daughter's housewarming party.

Customer Support: How thoughtful! I've now completed the cancellation of order RTL-8924-JK, and you should receive an email confirmation at the address ending in @gmail.com within the next 15 minutes.

Customer: Thank you so much for handling this so quickly. I was worried it would be complicated.

Customer Support: Not at all, I'm glad we could resolve this easily. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your remaining order or any other concerns today?

Customer: Actually, yes. Can you confirm that I'll only be charged the one-time amount of $247.99?

Customer Support: Certainly. I can confirm you'll only be charged once, for $247.99, which corresponds to order RTL-8923-JK. The second charge will be reversed and should never finalize on your statement.

Customer: That puts my mind at ease. Thank you for your excellent help today.

Customer Support: You're very welcome! Thank you for choosing us for your gift needs. Have a wonderful afternoon, and enjoy your daughter's housewarming party!
