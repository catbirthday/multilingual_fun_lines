=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good morning. I need help with an employee discount issue regarding my recent purchase.

Customer Support: Good morning, I'd be happy to help resolve that for you. Let me pull up your account using your email address or account number A-7829-VET if you have it available.

Customer: My email is sarah.martinez at riverside vet clinic. The purchase was made last Tuesday.

Customer Support: Thank you, Ms. Martinez. I've located your account and I can see your purchase from November 12th for $847.50. Let me review your employee discount eligibility status in our system.

Customer: I was told during onboarding that veterinary staff receive twenty percent off all orders.

Customer Support: I see the issue now. Your account shows veterinary professional status was approved on November 8th, but the discount code VET20-PROF wasn't activated until November 14th, two days after your purchase.

Customer: That's frustrating. I specifically waited to place this order after my credentials were verified.

Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, and you're absolutely right. This was our error in the activation timeline. I'm going to apply the full 20% discount retroactively, which comes to $169.50.

Customer: Thank you. When will I see that refund processed to my account?

Customer Support: Certainly. The refund will be processed today by 3:30 PM Eastern, and you should see it reflected in your bank account within 2-3 business days depending on your financial institution.

Customer: I appreciate that. Will future orders automatically apply the discount going forward?

Customer Support: Absolutely, yes. Your account now shows active status with code VET20-PROF permanently attached. All future orders will automatically apply the 20% discount at checkout, no manual entry required.

Customer: Perfect. I also need to update my shipping address to our new location.

Customer Support: Of course. I can update that right now. Please provide the new address and I'll ensure it's set as your default for all future shipments to arrive correctly.

Customer: It's four thousand two hundred Oak Boulevard, Suite Three Hundred, Riverside, California, nine two five zero one.

Customer Support: Thank you. I've updated your default shipping address to 4200 Oak Boulevard, Suite 300, Riverside, CA 92501. This change is effective immediately for any pending or future orders.

Customer: Excellent. Can you send me email confirmation of both the refund and address change?

Customer Support: Certainly. I'm sending a detailed confirmation email now to your address on file. You'll receive it within the next 5 minutes with reference number CS-11947-VET for your records.

Customer: That's everything I needed. Thank you for resolving this quickly and professionally.

Customer Support: You're very welcome, Ms. Martinez. I apologize again for the initial oversight with your discount activation. If you need any assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us directly at extension 4500.
