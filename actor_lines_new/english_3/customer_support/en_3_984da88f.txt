=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look, I've got—I've got a charge here. Twenty-seven fifty. That's not right.

Customer Support: Right right, let me pull that up, looking at account ACT-9042-HK88 and I see several recent transactions here, checking the twenty-seven fifty charge from October fourteenth at three forty-two PM Eastern.

Customer: That's what they said last time. Fixed it. Now it's back.

Customer Support: Okay okay I'm seeing the previous adjustment on September third for the same amount, reference number ADJ-7721-QM, and it looks like the system might've automatically reapplied it when your subscription renewed on the fourteenth.

Customer: Course it did. Look. Job starts Monday. Need this cleared up.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: I'm probably—probably not explaining this right. It's a duplicate. For primer.

Customer Support: No no you're explaining fine, I'm tracking this now, the system shows two charges for product code PRM-4487-GL which is the industrial primer five-gallon, both hitting your card ending in 8829 but only one shipment actually processed.

Customer: Exactly. Exactly exactly. One shipment. Two charges.

Customer Support: Right so what I'm doing—I'm doing a manual override here, canceling that duplicate charge immediately with confirmation number CNC-5509-XR21 and you should see that reflected within twenty-four to forty-eight hours on your statement.

Customer: Twenty-four to... that's what they said. Last time.

Customer Support: I think—let me try something different here, instead of waiting for the standard reversal I can process this as priority code P7 which basically forces it through in about two hours max.

Customer: Two hours. Okay. Okay okay. If—if it actually works.

Customer Support: It will.

Customer: Sorry. Just. Been calling about this. Three times now.

Customer Support: Totally understand that frustration, I'm noting this entire history in ticket TKT-0938-FV44 and flagging it for management review, plus I'm setting up an automatic alert to verify the refund processes correctly by end of business today.

Customer: And if it doesn't? Monday's coming. I need—I need supplies ordered.

Customer Support: Here's what I'll do, I'm giving you my direct extension 4-7-2-9-1 and case reference REF-8823-NZ, and if this isn't showing cleared by five PM today you call me directly and I'll process your supply order manually bypassing the payment hold.

Customer: Direct line. Right. We'll—we'll see if someone answers.

Customer Support: Someone will, that's me until eight PM Eastern today and I've got your account flagged priority status PST-901 so it'll pop right to the top of my queue, you won't wait more than one ring.
