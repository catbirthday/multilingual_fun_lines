I've also noted that all three employees achieved grades of B or higher, which strengthens the case. Your department's perfect reimbursement history over the past five years is another positive factor."

Also, please ensure the employees retain all original receipts, as we may need to verify amounts if approved. The maximum reimbursable amount per employee this semester is $3,000, so all three requests fall within guidelines."
