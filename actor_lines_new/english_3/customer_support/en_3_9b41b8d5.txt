=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I'm calling about our food service licensing account. We received an invoice showing a significant fee increase that we weren't notified about.

Customer Support: Good afternoon, and thank you for contacting us. I'd be happy to review your licensing account and clarify any concerns about the recent billing. May I have your business name and account number to pull up your information?

Customer: This is Riverside Stadium Concessions. Our account number should be under my name, Patricia Chen.

Customer Support: Thank you, Ms. Chen. I'm locating your account now. I can see Riverside Stadium Concessions under account number FSL-48927-RC with your primary food service license and three supplementary vendor permits active as of October 1st.

Customer: That's correct. We've held the same licensing structure for three years, but this month's invoice shows a thirty-five percent increase.

Customer Support: I understand your concern about the unexpected increase. Let me review your billing history and the current fee schedule. I can see your previous quarterly rate was $2,847.00, and the new invoice shows $3,843.45 for the upcoming quarter.

Customer: Exactly. That's nearly a thousand dollars more per quarter, which significantly impacts our operating budget. We need to understand why this happened.

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm pulling up the fee adjustment notices now. According to our records, a regulatory update went into effect September 15th affecting all venues with capacity over 5,000 that serve both prepared foods and alcoholic beverages under license type FSL-B2.

Customer: We never received any notification about this change. How were we supposed to prepare for such a substantial increase?

Customer Support: I sincerely apologize that you weren't properly notified. The system shows notifications were sent to the email address admin@riverside-venue.org on July 22nd and August 19th, but I'd like to verify if that's still your preferred contact method.

Customer: That email was decommissioned six months ago. We submitted an update form changing it to operations@riversidestadium.com in April.

Customer Support: I see the issue now. Your contact update form CUF-7412-RS from April 14th is in our system, but it appears the email field wasn't properly migrated to your primary account notifications. This is absolutely our error, and I apologize for the oversight.

Customer: I appreciate you finding that. What can we do about this invoice, given we had no opportunity to budget for these changes?

Customer Support: Of course. Given the notification error on our end, I can offer you several options. We can apply a one-time adjustment credit of $487.50 to offset the increase for this quarter, and I can also set up a payment plan to spread the remaining balance over 90 days interest-free.

Customer: That would help considerably. Can you also ensure our contact information is corrected immediately so this doesn't happen again?

Customer Support: Certainly. I'm updating your primary notification email to operations@riversidestadium.com right now, and I'm adding a secondary contact as well if you'd like to provide one. The update confirmation number is UCN-9823-PC and will be active within the hour.

Customer: Please add my direct email as secondary, pchen@riversidestadium.com. Also, could you send documentation about these new regulations?

Customer Support: I've added your direct email as the secondary contact. I'll send the complete regulatory documentation package to both email addresses today, including the fee schedule breakdown and compliance bulletin RCB-2024-09 that details all the changes affecting your license category.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you for resolving this so efficiently. When will I receive the adjusted invoice and payment plan details?

Customer Support: You'll receive the adjusted invoice within two hours showing the $487.50 credit applied, bringing your quarterly total to $3,355.95. The payment plan agreement will arrive separately by end of business today, and your first installment of $1,118.65 won't be due until November 15th.
