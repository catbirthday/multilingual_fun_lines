Customer: Hi, um, I need help canceling something. Been paying for months.

Customer Support: Got it. Let me pull up your account. What's your email?

Customer: It's sarah.chen at dentalworks dot com. Really embarrassing actually.

Customer Support: Found you. Account number AC-7739-DK2. I see a premium subscription. Active since... hmm. March twenty-third. That's about six months.

Customer: Yeah I know. Ugh. Totally forgot. I'm usually so organized.

Customer Support: Hey. Happens more than you think. Let me see what I can do here. Subscription code SUB-8821-VX shows. Ninety-nine ninety-nine monthly. I can cancel right now. But also. I think I can probably get you some credits.

Customer: Oh you don't have to—I mean, this is my fault.

Customer Support: No no. I want to help. System shows. Zero usage past three months. Reference number REF-2094-KL7. Let me submit for partial refund.

Customer: Er, really? That's—wow. Sorry for wasting your time with this.

Customer Support: Stop apologizing. Processing now. Credit request CR-5561-MP9 submitted. Should see. Probably three months back. Two ninety-nine ninety-seven total.

Customer: Hmm, okay so that goes back on my card?

Customer Support: Exactly. Seven to ten business days. Transaction ID TXN-3847-QR2. Also. Setting reminder flag. System will email before any future renewals.

Customer: You're being so nice. Let me see... yeah Tuesday works best.

Customer Support: Tuesday? Oh. I think you mean for the refund? Actually shows. Estimated October fifteenth. Case number CSE-9102-BN4.

Customer: No wait—sorry. Thinking about something else. Work stuff.

Customer Support: Understood. Alright. Subscription terminated. Confirmation number CNF-6623-TY8. Refund pending. Anything else I can sort of tackle?

Customer: Uh, that's it. Thanks. Really. Know this isn't your fault either.

Customer Support: My fault?

Customer: The system. Making you deal with forgetful people like me.

Customer Support: Oh! You're sweet. Look. Account note AN-4455-ZK1 added. If you ever resubscribe. Twenty percent discount waiting. Take care.
