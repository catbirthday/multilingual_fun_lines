=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Thank you so much for picking up. I'm—I'm actually kind of freaking out here.

Customer Support: Oh no no no, I'm—I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Let me pull up your account right away, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with it?

Customer: It's um... five five five, eight three seven, two nine four one.

Customer Support: Got it got it, pulling that up now, account A-88392-K, and I can see—oh. Oh dear. Yes yes yes, I see what you mean about the balance showing zero point zero zero dollars when there should definitely be funds there.

Customer: Right! There should be. There should be like three thousand in there.

Customer: I'm—I'm so sorry about this. This is—this is not good, I know. Let me check the transaction history for the past 72 hours, reference number TRX-9847623, to see if there's been any unusual activity.

Customer: I just—wait, actually—could this be because of that deposit I made yesterday?

Customer Support: Which deposit? Tell me more about that.

Customer: The mobile check deposit. For twenty-eight hundred. It said it went through.

Customer Support: Okay okay, mobile deposit, let me—let me check that. Transaction ID MD-7739-XK2 shows pending from yesterday at 3:47 PM, and—oh. Oh I'm so sorry. The system flagged it for additional verification.

Customer: What does that even mean?

Customer Support: Right right, so basically—and I'm really sorry this wasn't clearer—when deposits over 2500 dollars come through mobile, they go through extra fraud prevention checks, case number FP-88214-B, which can take 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: But my balance shouldn't be zero! I had—I had money in there already!

Customer Support: You're absolutely right. You're right right right. This is—this is our mistake. The system shouldn't have frozen your existing balance of 487 dollars and 32 cents while reviewing the new deposit.

Customer: Okay okay okay so... so what happens now? Can you fix this?

Customer Support: Yes. Yes yes. I'm—I'm putting through an override right now, authorization code OVR-5521-ZM9, to immediately release your original balance while the check clears.

Customer: Oh thank god. Thank you. That's—that's exactly what I needed.

Customer Support: Done. Your 487.32 is available now. The check deposit will still take another—let me see—probably 18 to 24 hours based on verification queue VQ-7734.

Customer: That's fine. That's fine. I just needed something in there. Thank you so much.

Customer Support: I'm—I'm really sorry about the scare. I've added a note, case note CN-9982341-A, to prevent this from happening with future deposits. Is there—is there anything else I can help with today?
