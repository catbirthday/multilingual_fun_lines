Subject: Your arson investigation proving the fire was deliberately set by the family you've been consoling for weeks

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] The accelerant patterns, they're... they're unmistakable. [long pause] Three weeks. Three fucking weeks I've been sitting with the Johnsons, holding Linda's hand while she cried about losing everything. [bitter] And the whole time... [sigh] God, the traces lead right back to their garage. Their own garage. 

[shaky voice] I keep looking at these samples thinking, um, maybe I'm wrong somehow? Like there's gotta be another explanation because... [pause] because I watched their kids draw pictures of their old house yesterday. [angry] But the pour patterns don't lie, the chemical signature is, uh... it's textbook. They planned this. 

[very quietly] Linda made me tea last Tuesday. [laugh] Can you believe that? She's making me fucking tea while I'm investigating the fire she set. [furious] And crying! The crying was so convincing, I actually— [clearing throat] I actually gave them my personal number in case they needed someone to talk to.

[confused] What kind of person does that to their own kids? I mean, the insurance money, sure, but... hmm, those children think this was some random tragedy. [sigh] 

[slowly] I have to arrest them tomorrow. [regretful] I have to walk into that shelter where they're staying and... and put cuffs on people I've been hugging for three weeks. [very sad] This job, sometimes I just... I don't know if I can keep doing this.
