Next month, next month—always next month. [frustrated] God, I'm such an idiot! \n\n[sigh] I can still smell it. That burnt metal and rubber smell, it's just stuck in my nose. All those vintage sleds I was restoring, the ones people trusted me with their—their family heirlooms basically. [voice breaking] How do I even call them? What do I say? [pause]\n\n[angry] Everyone kept telling me, \"Jerry, you need insurance, what if something happens?\" And I'd always say I was careful, I had fire extinguishers, I had—[bitter laugh] Yeah, lot of good those did against an electrical fire at three in the morning.\n\n[exhausted] My dad's tools were in there. The ones he gave me when I opened the shop. Those hammers and wrenches that built half the sleds in this town. [very sad] Can't exactly replace those at Home Depot, can you?\n\n[long pause]\n\n[very quietly] I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. I'm fifty-one years old and I'm... I'm starting from nothing. [shaky voice] Less than nothing, actually. Still owe money on equipment that's now just melted scrap."
