That's all I had left—six more months and I'd have my full pension, my retirement party, the whole thing. [pause] And now they're just... shutting it down. Next month. [shaky voice] How do you tell your wife that, um, that everything we planned for is just gone? The RV we were gonna buy, the trip to see the grandkids in Oregon... [sigh] I gave them my knees, my back, my—my whole life really. Started when I was twenty-five. [angry] You know what they offered us? Two weeks severance. Two weeks for thirty years. [laugh] That's not even a day per year I worked there. [very melancholic] I keep thinking about all the guys who are younger than me, they've got mortgages, kids in college. At least I'm close to Social Security age, but them? [trailing off] What are they supposed to... [pause] [sad] This town doesn't have anything else. The plant was it.
