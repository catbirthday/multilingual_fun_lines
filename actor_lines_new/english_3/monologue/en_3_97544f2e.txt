Subject: Your snowmobile mechanic shop losing everything in a fire with no insurance coverage

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very quietly] Twenty-three years. Twenty-three years of work, just... gone. [bitter] You know what the worst part is? I kept telling myself I'd get insurance next month. Next month, next month—always next month. [frustrated] God, I'm such an idiot! 

[sigh] I can still smell it. That burnt metal and rubber smell, it's just stuck in my nose. All those vintage sleds I was restoring, the ones people trusted me with their—their family heirlooms basically. [voice breaking] How do I even call them? What do I say? [pause]

[angry] Everyone kept telling me, "Jerry, you need insurance, what if something happens?" And I'd always say I was careful, I had fire extinguishers, I had—[bitter laugh] Yeah, lot of good those did against an electrical fire at three in the morning.

[exhausted] My dad's tools were in there. The ones he gave me when I opened the shop. Those hammers and wrenches that built half the sleds in this town. [very sad] Can't exactly replace those at Home Depot, can you?

[long pause]

[very quietly] I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. I'm fifty-one years old and I'm... I'm starting from nothing. [shaky voice] Less than nothing, actually. Still owe money on equipment that's now just melted scrap.
