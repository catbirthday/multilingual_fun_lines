Three years of sculpting practice, anatomy classes, chemistry for silicone mixing—all of it, and they're telling me my hands aren't... [bitter] God, I sold my car for this. Moved back in with my parents at thirty-two. Everyone thought I was crazy leaving my job, but I was so sure this was, um... this was it. [frustrated] Like what does that even mean, \"not steady enough\"? I've been doing the detail work! I made those practice ears, the prosthetic fingertips—they said those were good! [upset] They literally said \"promising\" last month. [sarcastic] But apparently promising doesn't mean anything when your hands have a microscopic tremor or whatever they think they saw. [very sad] I gave up everything. My apartment, my savings, my relationship couldn't even survive this because all I talked about was the apprenticeship, the dream of helping people feel whole again after losing parts of themselves and— [crying while speaking] and now what?
