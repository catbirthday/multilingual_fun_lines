=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] God, you actually believe me now. [pause] I can see it in your eyes, you finally— [voice breaking] Do you know how long I've waited for this moment? [sniffle] Everyone thought, um... everyone assumed I was after your money. [bitter] Your friends, your family, hell, even strangers at those parties would whisper about it. [hurt] And the worst part was watching you start to wonder too. [pause] I'd catch you looking at me sometimes, like you were trying to figure out if I was... real. [very sad] If what we had was real. [shaky voice] But I never stopped loving you, not once. [passionately] Even when you'd test me with those little comments about prenups or, uh, suggesting we split expensive dinners. [laugh sadly] I knew what you were doing. [warm] And I stayed because— [pause] Well, because you're worth more than any amount of money could ever be. [very sincerely] You make me laugh until my stomach hurts. [smiling speaking] You hold me when I have nightmares about losing my dad. [emotional] You're the first person I want to tell when something good happens. [crying while speaking] That's not about money, that's about... us. [relieved] And now you finally know that too.
