Every single argument we made about equal protection, they accepted. [very quietly] Five years. Five years of people telling me I was overreaching, that I was, um... that I was being too radical with my interpretation. [laugh] And now it's precedent. It's actually precedent. [speeding up] Do you understand what this means? Every courthouse in America, every single judge has to follow this now. Those families who've been waiting, who've been told no over and over—[pause] Sorry, I'm just... [sniffle] The plaintiff called me this morning, crying. She said her daughter finally understands that the law sees her as equal. That she matters. [passionately] This isn't just about one case anymore, you know? This is about every kid who's been told they don't belong. [very slowly] We changed that today. We actually changed it. [warm] And I keep thinking about my first day on the bench, how I promised myself I'd use this position to... to make things better. [extremely happy] We did it. We actually did it."
