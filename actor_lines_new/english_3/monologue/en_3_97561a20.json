[pause] But they told me about the restructuring and, um... God, half the team. Half. [very quietly] And I have to be the one who tells them.\n\n[shaky voice] Sarah's got two kids in college. Mike just bought that house—he showed me pictures last week, he was so excited about the backyard. [sigh] And here I am, sitting on this information like some kind of...

[frustrated] What am I supposed to do, turn it down? Someone else would just take it and do the same thing anyway.\n\n[very sad] I keep thinking maybe I can save some of them, you know?
