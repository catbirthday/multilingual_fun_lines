=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Oh my God, is this—wait, is this from Marcus? [delighted] Look at this place! I can't even... wow. Just wow. Five years, has it really been five years? [pause] I remember when he first walked into my office, he was so... God, he looked defeated. [very slowly] Like he'd already given up, you know? And now look at this—three locations? [laugh] Three! I mean, back then we were literally trying to figure out if he could even keep the lights on for another month. [warm] The way his hands were shaking when he showed me those bankruptcy papers... [sigh] And I kept telling him, "Marcus, we can turn this around, we just need to—" but he didn't believe me. Not at first. [emotional] Jeez, I'm actually getting a little... [sniffle] Sorry, it's just, um... seeing someone come back from that edge, it's... [happy] Look at all those employees! He's got, what, twenty people working for him now? [very sincerely] This is why I do this job. This right here. [chuckle] I should frame this photo. Actually, you know what? I think I will.
