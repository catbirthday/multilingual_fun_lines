[frustrated] I mean, I get it, money's tight everywhere, but couldn't they have warned us? Given us some notice before pulling the rug out? [pause] I've been telling everyone about this. My mom, she was so proud when I got in. \"Finally found your calling,\" she said. [bitter] Some calling, huh? [sigh] The thing is, I was actually good at it. Like, really good. The professors said I had this, um, this natural way with grieving families. That I understood the importance of what we do. [very sad] And now what? Start over? Find something else? [pause] I'm thirty-two years old. I can't just keep starting over. [quietly] All those nights studying embalming techniques, restoration procedures, state regulations... for nothing. [long pause] Maybe I could transfer to the program upstate? But that's, what, three hours away? And who knows if they'll even take my credits. [exhausted] God, I'm so tired of things falling apart. [pause] But I guess I'll... I'll figure something out. I always do, right? [trailing off] Right..."
