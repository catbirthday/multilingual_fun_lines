Fresh out of college, no experience, and they took a chance on me. [pause] Five years. Five years I've been here. And now I'm looking at transaction records that are... they're not just irregular, they're deliberate. [bitter] The routing patterns, the encrypted packets going to shell companies— it's textbook money laundering. I built half this network infrastructure myself. [sigh] My hands literally built the system they're using to steal from people. [frustrated] God, I feel so stupid! All those late nights I stayed, thinking I was helping build something good. [quietly] Marcus hired me personally. He mentored me. Taught me everything about enterprise architecture. [pause] But this is, um... this is millions of dollars. People's pensions. [shaky voice] How am I supposed to just pretend I don't know? How am I supposed to come to work tomorrow and smile at these people? [slowly] I already copied everything to an encrypted drive. [regretful] I guess that means I've already decided, haven't I? [long pause] They gave me my start, but they're destroying people's lives. [resolved] I have to send this to the authorities tonight."
