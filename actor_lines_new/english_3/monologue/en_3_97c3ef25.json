[pause] I can't— I literally cannot believe this is happening. All those nights studying for that stupid scrum certification, I was convinced I was wasting my time. Remember when I failed the practice test three times? Three times! And I was like, crying in my car outside the testing center thinking I'm never gonna make it through this. [laugh] But I did it. I actually did it. [relieved] And now they're offering me, um... they're offering me twenty thousand more than I make now. Twenty thousand! That's like— that's life-changing money. [very quietly] I keep thinking they're gonna call back and say they made a mistake. Like, \"Sorry, we meant to call someone else.\" But no, they specifically said my scrum certification was what set me apart. The thing that almost broke me is what got me here. [excited] I need to call Mom. I need to— wait, should I negotiate? Is that a thing? I don't even care, honestly. [extremely happy] Six months of hell and it actually meant something. It actually worked."
