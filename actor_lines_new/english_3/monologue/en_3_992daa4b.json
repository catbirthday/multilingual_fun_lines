[frustrated] I had everything planned out, you know? The vocational training, the, um... the partnerships with local businesses who'd actually hire the girls. [very sad] Maria was going to start her nursing program next month. [pause] Next month! And Sasha, she was so excited about the bookkeeping course, she'd already bought her textbooks and... [trailing off] \n\n[angry] They think we're just criminals here, but these women, they're— [short pause] I've watched them grow, helped them through, err... through things that would break most people. [passionately] And I was finally going to help them get out properly, with actual skills, with dignity! [cry] Not just thrown onto the street with nothing. \n\n[shaky voice] Twenty thousand dollars I'd saved for this transition program. [laugh bitterly] My own retirement money, basically.
