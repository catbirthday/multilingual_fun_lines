[pause] And now I'm sitting here with... with proof that they've been skimming government contracts for, what, six years? [bitter] The irony is they hired me specifically to secure their networks, and I did such a good job that I found their, um... their dirty little secret. [frustrated] I mean, how was I supposed to know the encrypted traffic I flagged wasn't hackers but actually their own executives moving money around?\n\n[hesitantly] The thing is, I keep thinking about David—he mentored me, you know? Taught me everything. [very sad] And now his signature is all over these transactions. [sigh] I could just, err... I could pretend I never saw it. Delete the logs. Nobody would know. [anxious] But then what? I become part of it? [angry] These are taxpayer funds they're stealing! Healthcare programs, infrastructure—real people are getting hurt while they're buying yachts.\n\n[shaky voice] Tomorrow I'm meeting with the FBI. [quietly] I've already copied everything to multiple drives, just in case they try to, hmm, make me disappear or whatever. [very sincerely] This company made me who I am, but I guess... I guess that means they also made someone who won't let them get away with this."
