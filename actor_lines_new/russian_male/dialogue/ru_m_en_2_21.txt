Character 1 [en]: I can't believe you're making me do this at 6 AM.

Character 2 [en]: [very quickly] One two three four five okay slow down! You're going too fast on those reps. We want controlled movements here, not a race to the finish.

Character 1 [en]: My legs are already burning.

Character 2 [en]: That's the lactic acid building up, totally normal. Six, seven, eight. Your form is actually looking better than last week though.

Character 1 [en]: You said that last week too.

Character 2 [en]: Nine, ten, and I meant it both times! Eleven, twelve. You've been consistently improving your hip alignment during squats.

Character 1 [en]: How many more?

Character 2 [en]: Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. We're going to twenty today, then straight into lunges. Your cardiovascular endurance has improved enough to handle the back-to-back sets.

Character 1 [en]: Twenty? You said fifteen yesterday!

Character 2 [en]: Sixteen, seventeen. Yesterday was a recovery day, today we're pushing boundaries. Eighteen, your knees are caving slightly, push them out.

Character 1 [en]: I hate lunges.

Character 2 [en]: Nineteen, twenty, excellent! Everyone hates lunges until they see what they do for their glutes and quads. Ready for the next set?

Character 1 [en]: Can we take a water break?

Character 2 [en]: Thirty seconds, hydrate and shake it out. Your heart rate is at 145, which is perfect for your target zone. We want to maintain that intensity.

Character 1 [en]: [child-like] But my legs feel like jello!

Character 2 [en]: That jello feeling means you're recruiting muscle fibers you don't normally use. One, two, three on the lunges now. Keep that back straight.

Character 1 [en]: Why do you count so slowly during lunges?

Character 2 [en]: Four, five, six. Because time under tension builds more muscle than rushing through movements. Seven, eight, you're tilting forward again.

Character 1 [en]: [condescending] I know what I'm doing.

Character 2 [en]: Nine, ten, clearly you do, which is why your knee just went past your toes. Eleven, twelve, let's reset that form before you hurt yourself.
