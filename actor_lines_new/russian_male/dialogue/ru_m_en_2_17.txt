Character 1 [en]: Excuse me, are you using all six of these balls?

Character 2 [en]: No no, just testing them out. I have this whole theory that bowling balls have personalities—you gotta find one that actually likes you. This purple one though? Total disaster.

Character 1 [en]: That's... actually kind of brilliant. Mind if I join you? Lane seven's been broken for an hour.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, come on over! Fair warning though, I'm terrible. Like, impressively bad. I've hit other people's lanes twice tonight.

Character 1 [en]: How do you even hit other people's lanes?

Character 2 [en]: It's a gift, really. You need just the right amount of chaotic energy. Plus these rental shoes are definitely two different sizes—I swear they do it on purpose.

Character 1 [en]: I haven't laughed like that in months. I'm Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: [friendly] Sam. Thanks for not immediately fleeing when you saw my bowling form. Most people watch me wind up and suddenly remember they have somewhere urgent to be.

Character 1 [en]: My wife used to say I bowled like I was angry at the pins.

Character 2 [en]: Used to? Oh. Yeah, I— I get it. My ex and I came here every Thursday for three years. Now I come alone and terrorize innocent bowling balls.

Character 1 [en]: Is that why you're here at eleven PM on a Tuesday?

Character 2 [en]: Caught me. Tuesday nights the serious bowlers aren't here to judge. Plus Roberto, the night guy, he lets me have my emotional support nachos without the questions.

Character 1 [en]: Emotional support nachos?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely. Bowl a gutter ball, that's one nacho. Strike in the wrong lane? Three nachos. And when you throw the ball backwards—which yes, has happened—you just eat the whole plate.

Character 1 [en]: [very quickly] You threw a bowling ball backwards?

Character 2 [en]: Okay so I was trying this YouTube technique and the ball was really slippery and physics just... abandoned me. Roberto still has the security footage. He watches it when he needs a laugh.

Character 1 [en]: Can you teach me your chaos method?

Character 2 [en]: Wait, you actually want to learn how to bowl badly? Because I've perfected magnificent failure here. Last week I knocked down exactly one pin the entire game. One. That takes dedication.

Character 1 [en]: [short pause] Maybe I need some magnificent failure in my life right now.

Character 2 [en]: Well then Marcus, let's do this. First rule—forget everything about proper form. Second rule—embrace the gutter, it's your friend now. And third? Always, always blame the rental shoes.
