=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Three hundred thousand, Alex.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Look, I know how the numbers sound when you say them out loud like that, but the liquidity pools I've been building are generating twenty percent monthly returns. [quickly] That's more than Dad ever made with his traditional investments.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] You took our inheritance money and dumped it into internet coins without even asking me. [very quietly] I've been building sets for indie films, scraping by on fifteen hundred a week, thinking we had that safety net from Mom and Dad.

Character 2 [en]: [condescending] You're still thinking about money like it's 2010, making physical things people can touch. [sighs] The entire financial system is moving on-chain, and if we don't position ourselves now, that inheritance becomes worthless inflation fodder anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] I needed that money to finally open my workshop, to build something real instead of constantly hustling for the next production. [pause] You knew that was my five-year plan.

Character 2 [en]: [dismissive] Your workshop would've been a money pit, and you know it. [speeding up] Props and set design is dying anyway, everything's going CGI and virtual production now.

Character 1 [en]: That's exactly the problem with you tech people, you think everything physical is obsolete. [angrily] Some of us still believe in craftsmanship, in making things that exist beyond a screen.

Character 2 [en]: [sarcastically] Right, because hand-carved foam swords for community theater really contribute to society. [laughs] At least my work is building the future of finance, not decorating someone else's fantasy.

Character 1 [en]: [very sad] You sound just like Dad when he used to mock my art degree. [quietly] I thought you were different, that you understood why I chose this path even when it didn't make financial sense.

Character 2 [en]: [uncomfortable] This isn't about your career choices, it's about maximizing our assets. [clears throat] The smart contracts I've deployed are already earning us passive income that could fund ten workshops. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Us? There is no us in this decision! [loudly] You went behind my back, liquidated everything, and now you're trying to sell me on some algorithmic ponzi scheme. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] It's not a ponzi scheme, it's decentralized finance, and if you'd actually listen instead of immediately dismissing everything I do, you'd understand the opportunity here.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The opportunity to lose everything when your magical internet money crashes overnight? [slowly] I've watched you go through this cycle before with NFTs, with that gaming token, with whatever trendy tech thing promised instant wealth. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [angry] Those were learning experiences that led me to where I am now, building actual infrastructure that major institutions are adopting.

Character 1 [en]: Get it back. [firmly]

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] I can't.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Of course you can't, because it's all locked in some smart contract you can't even explain to me properly. [bitter] Mom would be devastated if she knew what you'd done with the money she left us.

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] The funds are staked for six months minimum, but the returns will prove I was right. [mumbling] You'll thank me when we triple our capital. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: I'm done trusting you with anything that matters. [very sad] When this inevitably implodes, don't call me. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [desperately] Wait, just let me show you the analytics dashboard, the audit reports, the institutional backing we have. [quickly] This isn't some random gamble, I've spent two years researching these protocols, and I did this for both of us, not just myself.
