=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] They told me I had to come see you before they'd process my discharge papers. [pause] Something about mandatory transition counseling for anyone with a Purple Heart or combat action ribbon.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] I appreciate you coming in, Staff Sergeant Torres. [quietly] I know this isn't easy, sitting across from another stranger who wants to talk about what happened over there and how you're planning to move forward.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Move forward.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Poor choice of words on my part. [sighs] Let me be more direct—I'm not here to make you relive anything or pretend that civilian life will somehow fix what happened in Kandahar.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] You read the file then, about the convoy, about how I was thrown clear when the IED hit and everyone else— [trailing off]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I read enough to know you've been carrying something no one should have to carry alone. [pause] My job isn't to dig into that wound, it's to help you figure out practical things like housing, employment, benefits.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Benefits won't bring Rodriguez back, or Johnson, or any of them. [exhales] They keep calling me lucky, the survivor, like that's supposed to mean something positive.

Character 2 [en]: [studying] You're right, there's nothing lucky about being the one left to remember. [slowly] But you're here, breathing, and whether that feels like a burden or not, we need to talk about what happens next week when you're officially a civilian.

Character 1 [en]: [anxiously] My wife thinks I should go back to school, use the GI Bill, become an engineer like I always talked about before I enlisted. [laughs bitterly] Like I can just sit in a classroom and pretend I'm twenty-two again.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Nobody's asking you to pretend anything.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] Then what are you asking exactly? [very loudly] Because everyone keeps talking about transitions and moving on and finding purpose, but they weren't there when Martinez bled out in my arms while I couldn't do anything but watch.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] I'm asking you to let me help you navigate the bureaucracy so you don't lose your benefits while you're figuring out who you are now. [pause] Not who you were before, not who you think you should be, but who you actually are today.

Character 1 [en]: The VA therapist keeps saying survivor's guilt is common, that I need to forgive myself for living when they didn't. [shaky voice] But how do you forgive yourself for something that wasn't even your choice?

Character 2 [en]: [harmonizing] You don't forgive yourself for surviving, Torres—you honor the weight of it. [sighs] Every day you wake up is another chance to carry their memory forward in whatever way makes sense to you.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] I dream about them every night, hear their voices when I'm alone, see them in crowds sometimes before I remember they're gone. [quieter] My wife doesn't know what to do with me anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] That kind of grief changes a marriage, changes everything really. [gently] There are support groups specifically for combat survivors and their families, people who understand this exact weight you're carrying without needing explanations.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Maybe I should just take a job with a defense contractor, stay close to the military somehow. [sighs] At least they'd understand why I check every parked car, why I can't sit with my back to a door.

Character 2 [en]: [studying] That's one path, and there's nothing wrong with it if that's what feels right. [pause] But I've also seen survivors find meaning in completely different directions—teaching, counseling, even creative work that helps process what can't be said directly.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Rodriguez had a daughter, she's three now, and his wife asked me to be her godfather because I was there when— [voice breaking] How do I look at that little girl and explain why I came home and her daddy didn't?

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] You don't explain it, because there's no explanation that makes sense of random horror. [softly] But maybe one day, when she's older, you can tell her who her father was, share the stories that matter, be the bridge to a memory she's too young to form herself.
