Scenario: A veteran pack member must evaluate whether a trainee who failed during their first real hunt deserves a second chance or should be expelled from the pack.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] The others are calling for your expulsion, Marcus. [pause] When you froze during the hunt last night, three of our youngest members nearly got hurt trying to cover for your position.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] I know I messed up, I know that, but [exhales] everything happened so fast and the bear was twice the size you said it would be.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] My grandfather used to say that fear reveals who we really are. [sighs] In forty years with this pack, I've seen plenty of trainees freeze on their first real hunt.

Character 2 [en]: [anxiously] So you're saying others have done this before? [quickly] Please, I need to know if anyone else got a second chance after something like this happened.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] There was someone, yes. [long pause] Twenty years ago, a trainee panicked worse than you did, abandoned their entire flank, and we lost two good hunters that night.

Character 2 [en]: [desperately] What happened to them? [stuttering] Did they get expelled or did the pack give them another opportunity to prove themselves?

Character 1 [en]: [backward-looking] They stayed. [clearing throat] Became one of our strongest members eventually, though it took years to earn back the trust they'd lost in those thirty seconds of cowardice.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] You're talking about yourself, aren't you? [very quietly] That's why you're the only one who hasn't voted for my expulsion yet.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] The scars on my back aren't from battles won, kid. [sighs] They're reminders of every mistake that nearly cost someone else their life.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Then you understand that I can learn from this. [passionately] Give me three months, just three months to prove I belong here with the pack.

Character 1 [en]: Three months won't erase what happened last night.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Then what will? [loudly] Tell me what I need to do because I'm not giving up on this, not after everything I've sacrificed to get here!

Character 1 [en]: [stern] First, you stop shouting at the one person trying to help you. [pause] Second, you need to understand that redemption here isn't earned through time but through action.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] You're right, I'm sorry. [exhales] I just feel like I'm drowning here and everyone's already written me off as a failure.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] The next hunt is in three days, tracking the same bear. [slowly] If you volunteer to take point position, I'll make sure the council delays their vote until after.

Character 2 [en]: [gasps] Point position? [anxious] That's the most dangerous spot, especially with an animal we've already provoked once.

Character 1 [en]: [imparting] Exactly. [firmly] The pack doesn't need brave words or promises, Marcus, they need to see you choose danger over safety when it matters most.

Character 2 [en]: [long pause] I'll do it. [confidently] And this time, I won't let fear make my decisions for me.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Good. [sighs] Because if you freeze again, there won't be anyone in position to cover for you this time.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] I understand. [pause] Thank you for believing I deserve this chance, even after what happened.
