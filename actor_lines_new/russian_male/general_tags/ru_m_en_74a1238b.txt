Scenario: An investor relations manager meets with a fixer in a hotel bar after discovering evidence of insider trading that could destroy their company's upcoming IPO.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hushed] I found the trades buried in subsidiary accounts, millions moving three days before every major announcement we've made this quarter. This could kill our IPO next month.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] Show me the pattern you're seeing. In my experience, these things are either very simple or very sophisticated, rarely anything in between.

Character 1 [en]: [anxiously] It's our CFO's nephew, twenty-three years old, using his girlfriend's father's brokerage account. The kid made four million in six weeks. [exhales] The SEC will tear us apart.

Character 2 [en]: Four million is enough to be noticed but not enough to run. He's still playing with house money, which means he thinks he's untouchable. [thoughtfully]

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] We go public in thirty-two days. If this surfaces, every institutional investor will pull out, and eight years of building this company goes straight to hell.

Character 2 [en]: The girlfriend's father, does he know his account's been compromised? Because that changes our approach considerably.

Character 1 [en]: He's in assisted living with dementia. The kid has power of attorney. [bitterly] It's almost elegant how he set it up.

Character 2 [en]: [impressed] Clever boy.

Character 1 [en]: [sharply] Clever? He's destroying everything we've built! Our employees have stock options that'll be worthless if this gets out.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Three options here. We can make him disappear financially, make the trades disappear digitally, or make the whole thing look like something else entirely. Each has a different price point.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] I've never done anything like this before. My whole career has been about transparency, proper disclosures, keeping everything above board. [sighs]

Character 2 [en]: Above board is a luxury for companies that don't have nephews with gambling problems and access to material information. You called me, which means you've already decided. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [resigned] The third option, making it look like something else. What would that involve exactly?

Character 2 [en]: We create a paper trail showing the kid was being fed false information by a competitor trying to manipulate your stock. He becomes a victim, not a perpetrator.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] And people will believe that? The timing on these trades is perfect, every single one of them.

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] People believe what makes sense with the evidence presented. I'll need access to your competitor's communication systems for about six hours. Can you get me that?

Character 1 [en]: [nervously] Our CEO golfs with their CEO every Sunday. I could probably get into their guest network during the next round. [swallows hard] Jesus, listen to what I'm saying.

Character 2 [en]: Two hundred thousand. [flatly]

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] That's it? I mean, that's a lot, but I expected... I don't know what I expected actually.

Character 2 [en]: [wryly] I'm not fixing a presidential election here. Just some creative accounting and digital archaeology. Half now, half when your IPO closes successfully. [stands]
