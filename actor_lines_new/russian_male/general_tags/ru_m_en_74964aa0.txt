Scenario: A hearing aid specialist discovers their flatmate has been secretly struggling with progressive hearing loss but has been too proud to ask for help.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] I found the audiologist reports in the recycling bin, three of them from different clinics, all dated within the last six months.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Those were just routine checkups for work, you know how the construction site requires annual hearing tests now with all the new safety regulations.

Character 1 [en]: [gently pressing] Marcus, routine work screenings don't require follow-ups with specialists, and they definitely don't include recommendations for hearing aids marked 'urgent'.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I've been managing fine without making it into some big thing, turning the TV up a bit louder isn't exactly a crisis. [dismissive exhale]

Character 1 [en]: [measured] You asked me to repeat myself four times at dinner last night, and you've stopped answering your phone because you can't hear it ring anymore.

Character 2 [en]: It's been getting worse for about two years now, started with just missing consonants but now whole conversations just, [sighs], disappear into noise.

Character 1 [en]: [professional but caring] That progression pattern sounds like noise-induced hearing loss combined with possible early presbycusis, which is completely treatable with the right approach and equipment.

Character 2 [en]: [barely audible] My dad went deaf at fifty-two, spent the last twenty years of his life isolated and angry because he was too proud to wear 'those things'.

Character 1 [en]: The technology has changed dramatically even in the last five years, we're talking about devices so small they're virtually invisible, with Bluetooth connectivity and adaptive sound processing.

Character 2 [en]: It's not about the technology, it's about admitting that I'm broken somehow, that I'm becoming him. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: You're not broken, Marcus, and you're definitely not your father because you're here having this conversation instead of shutting everyone out.

Character 2 [en]: Every morning I wake up terrified that today will be the day I can't hear my alarm, or worse, that someone will need help and I won't hear them calling.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] I've fitted hundreds of devices, and the relief on people's faces when they realize they haven't lost the world of sound forever is why I do this job.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] What if it doesn't work?

Character 1 [en]: [reassuring] Then we adjust, we try different models, different settings, because giving up isn't an option when there are so many solutions we haven't tried yet.

Character 2 [en]: The construction guys already joke about me being the old man of the crew at thirty-eight, and now I'll be the old man with hearing aids. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You know what's worse than wearing discrete hearing aids? Missing safety warnings on a construction site, or not hearing your sister when she calls about mom.

Character 2 [en]: [quieter] Could you really fit me with something that wouldn't be obvious, something that would just let me be normal again without the whole world knowing?

Character 1 [en]: I can do you one better, I'll fit you myself at the clinic after hours, no paperwork through insurance yet, just to see how it feels.

Character 2 [en]: [exhales slowly] Okay, yes, let's try it, but if I hate them or if they make me feel like an invalid, I'm walking away, no arguments.
