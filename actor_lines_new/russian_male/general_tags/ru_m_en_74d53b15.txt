=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [measured] Please, have a seat in the examination chair, and we'll start with some basic tests to determine what's causing your vision problems.

Character 2 [en]: [dryly] Vision problems. [chuckles] That's one way to describe not being able to read the fine print on contracts I've been signing for millennia.

Character 1 [en]: [professionally calm] The aging process affects everyone differently, though I admit your case is somewhat unique given the, ah, extended timeline we're discussing here.

Character 2 [en]: [wry] You're taking this remarkably well for someone who just had the Prince of Darkness walk into their strip mall optometry practice at three in the afternoon.

Character 1 [en]: [methodically] Look straight ahead at the red dot, please, and try not to blink while I examine your retinal structure with this light.

Character 2 [en]: You know, most mortals would be screaming or praying by now, but here you are adjusting your little machines like this is perfectly routine. [intrigued]

Character 1 [en]: In thirty years of practice, I've learned that everyone who walks through that door needs help seeing clearly, regardless of their, let's say, metaphysical status.

Character 2 [en]: The irony isn't lost on me that after eons of showing humanity their darkest truths, I can't even read my own handwriting anymore.

Character 1 [en]: [calmly focused] Interesting. Your pupils aren't responding to light in the conventional way, but there's definitely a refractive error we can correct with the right prescription.

Character 2 [en]: Refractive error sounds so clinical for what feels like cosmic punishment, though I suppose that's your expertise showing through. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: Read the third line down on the chart, and we'll work through each progressively smaller row until you can't distinguish the letters anymore. [adjusting equipment]

Character 2 [en]: [squinting] E, F, P, T, O, Z... wait, that last one is either Z or 2, and honestly, the distinction matters when you're dealing with souls versus percentages.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtfully] Better or worse?

Character 2 [en]: Better, definitely better, though 'better' is relative when you've spent eternity watching everything get progressively blurrier. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] One or two?

Character 2 [en]: [considering] Two makes the edges sharper, but one makes everything feel less harsh, like looking through forgiveness if that makes any sense.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly methodical] The measurements indicate you'll need progressive lenses with a significant astigmatism correction, plus a coating to reduce glare from, well, flames.

Character 2 [en]: [softly amazed] You're actually going to make me glasses. After everything I've done, all the suffering I've overseen, you're just going to help me see.

Character 1 [en]: Vision is a fundamental need, and meeting fundamental needs without judgment is perhaps the most human thing we can do, wouldn't you say?

Character 2 [en]: In all my existence, I never expected clarity to come from someone simply doing their job with compassion. [pause] Thank you.
