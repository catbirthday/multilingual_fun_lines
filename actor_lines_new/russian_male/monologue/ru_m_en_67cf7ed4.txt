Subject: The cycle counter attention to detail just uncovered an error that saved your company thousands of dollars

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [excited] Oh my God, I can't believe I actually caught that! I was just doing my normal cycle count, you know? Going through the warehouse inventory like I always do, and something just... didn't look right. [pause] The numbers on the purchase orders—they were, um, they were off by a decimal point. Like, we've been ordering ten times what we actually needed for the past three months! [nervous] At first I thought, hmm, maybe I'm reading it wrong? So I checked it again. And again. [relieved] But no, it was definitely an error. Someone must've entered 250.0 instead of 25.0 for our monthly units, and the system just kept, uh... kept auto-ordering based on that. [happy] The accounting team said we would've lost at least thirty thousand by year-end if I hadn't spotted it. Thirty thousand! [quietly] I mean, I always knew being detail-oriented was important, but this is... wow. [proud] My manager actually called me into her office just to thank me. Said I saved the quarter's budget. [laugh] All those times people teased me for being too meticulous, for double-checking everything—well, who's laughing now, right?
