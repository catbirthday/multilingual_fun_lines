=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confidently] You know what's funny? These kids can smell fake from a mile away. [chuckle] They sit there, arms crossed, giving me that look like "yeah, right, what do you know about it?" And then I tell them about the time I got arrested at sixteen for tagging the courthouse. [pause] Their whole body language changes. [empathetically] Suddenly I'm not just another adult lecturing them about choices. [slowly] I'm someone who gets it. Who's been where they are, feeling like the whole world's against them and the only way to matter is to push back hard. [regretful] God, I was so angry back then. [sigh] Everything was a fight, everything was... was about proving I didn't need anyone. [warm] But that's exactly why they listen to me now. When I tell Marcus that I understand why he wants to drop out, I mean it. [passionately] I dropped out too! [short pause] When I tell Shayla that running with that crew feels like family, I'm not guessing. [very sincerely] I had my crew. They were everything until, um... until they weren't. [bitter] Until I realized loyalty only went one way. [relieved] These kids need someone who won't judge them for their worst moments. [smiling speaking] Someone who can look at their mistakes and see potential instead. Because that's what someone did for me.
