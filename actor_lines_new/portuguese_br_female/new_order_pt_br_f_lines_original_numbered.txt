# --- DIALOGUE ---
1. Oh man, The Last Dance? Yeah, I actually binged the whole thing in like two days, which is, mmm, probably not healthy but whatever. The behind-the-scenes stuff from that final Bulls season was just, I mean, absolutely incredible to watch unfold.
2. Right? The way he just, uhh, mentally destroyed some of those guys was honestly hard to watch sometimes. But then you see the results and it's like, okay, I guess that's what it takes to win six championships, you know?
3. Mmm, yeah that whole dynamic was, err, way more complicated than anyone realized back then. Pippen was basically getting paid less than like the twelfth guy on the bench, which is just insane when you think about it.
4. Ooh yeah, that show literally got me into F1, which is, I mean, kind of embarrassing to admit but whatever. Before that I thought it was just cars going in circles but the drama, the personalities, it's like reality TV but with, you know, actual stakes.
5. [furious] Don't even get me started on the fucking time zones! I set my alarm for 5:30 last week for quali and they delayed it by two hours because of rain and I just, ugh, I was so pissed off I couldn't go back to sleep!
# --- GENERAL_TAGS ---
6. I remember that fire, yeah, though I didn't know her name was Sarah at the time—just a terrified kid trapped behind a wall of flames. [exhales] How did you track me down after all these years?
7. [gently] You couldn't have been in two places at once, and from what I remember about that night, the whole district was chaos with fires breaking out simultaneously.
8. She's alive because someone was there to help her, and that's what matters—not the vengeance, not the lists, just the fact that she got to grow up and have a life. [softly] What would your parents think of the path you've chosen?
9. I've saved forty-three people since that night, kept count of every single one because it helps me sleep, helps me believe there's still good we can do in this world despite all the darkness.
10. And you've spent those same years destroying yourself for revenge that will never bring them back, never fill that hole inside you. [sighs] I've seen what that path does to people, how it hollows them out completely.
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS ---
11. I know how this looks, reaching out now when I never defended you back then. [sighs] But you're the only one who understands what it's like to be completely cast out.
12. They move me every three weeks, so decorating seems pointless. [exhales] The prosecutor says after the trial I can have something more permanent, but we both know permanent is relative when you've exposed a billion-dollar fraud scheme.
13. Dad's probably telling everyone I'm on a research sabbatical in Europe. [bitter laugh] Can't have the community knowing his golden child is hiding in a strip mall apartment eating microwave dinners.
14. [softly] Are they asking about me? Through other people, I mean, since they won't talk to you directly?
15. God, that sounds like her. [exhales] Remember when she tried to secretly find out if you were dating someone at Christmas that one year by asking about your roommate situation?
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT ---
16. Oh! Let me pull up your account here. I see your customer ID is CUS-4492-NV and... okay okay, I'm looking at the notes from your call on Monday, November 18th. Can you tell me what resolution they promised you?
17. Right, I see it here now. They approved a thirty percent refund on order RFN-8823-QM for the damaged items. That should have been processed within 24 to 48 hours. But I'm... I'm not seeing it actually went through on our end.
18. I know, I know this is frustrating. Let me dig deeper into this. Sometimes our system... honestly, it's kind of terrible with these automatic refunds. Your case number was CS-20241118-447 and yeah, it just never triggered.
19. It's not that they forgot exactly. Our rep Sarah did everything right on her end. Put in all the codes correctly. It's just... the system probably glitched between departments. I see this maybe twice a week and it drives me crazy too.
20. Unfortunately yeah. But here's what I'm doing right now. I'm manually pushing through refund authorization MAR-7729-XK with override code OVRD-9982. Should hit your account ending in 4476 within the next two hours. Not 24, not 48. Two hours.
# --- MONOLOGUE ---
21. [extremely happy] They called me into corporate today and I thought I was in trouble or something but— oh my God. [pause] The regional manager was there. [excited] And she starts showing me this PowerPoint and it's MY system! [laugh loudly] The stupid little color-coded cart thing I made because I was bored! [confidently] Apparently it increased efficiency by like forty percent at our store. [very excited] And now they're rolling it out to all two hundred locations! [gasp softly] They kept calling it "innovative" and "streamlined" and I'm sitting there like, I just didn't want to walk back and forth so much. [chuckle] But here's the crazy part. [slowly] They offered me a promotion. [pause] District operations coordinator. [anxious] Which is, um... that's a real job with an office and everything. [nervous laugh] I've been pushing carts for three years and now I'll be training managers? [hesitantly] I mean, I said yes obviously, but it's kind of terrifying? [warm] My mom cried when I told her. [smiling speaking] She kept saying "I knew you were too smart for that job" and I'm like, Mom, I literally just got lazy and made a chart. [relieved] But maybe that's what innovation is, right? [passionately] Finding better ways to do things because the old way sucks. [happy] Guess I'm management now.

# === REMAINING LINES ===

# --- DIALOGUE (continued) ---
22. Ahh, You Cannot Be Serious, yeah that was, hmm, surprisingly introspective actually. Like you expect just racket-throwing tantrums but he really digs into the whole perfectionism thing and how it basically, err, destroyed him mentally for years.
23. [overly polite] Oh wow, that must have been such a wonderful experience for you! I'm sure meeting someone of his caliber was truly special and I'd absolutely love to hear more about what that interaction was like if you wouldn't mind sharing.
24. The Red Wings-Avalanche one? Dude, that was, uhh, basically a documentary about assault on ice, honestly. Claude Lemieux getting his face rearranged, the goalie fights, I mean it barely even looked like hockey at certain points.
25. Oh that was Roy and Vernon, and then later Roy and, um, Osgood I think? Those goalies were absolutely unhinged back then, just dropping gloves and meeting at center ice like, I don't know, like gladiators or something.
26. Hah! I mean, if you count exotic animal wrestling as a sport then, err, sure why not? But honestly that whole thing was less documentary and more like, hmm, watching a slow-motion train wreck while everyone involved somehow got progressively crazier with each episode.
27. Oh, that's actually fascinating! So, um, they need three because their blood is copper-based instead of iron-based like ours, which makes it, you know, way less efficient at carrying oxygen, so they basically need extra pumping power to survive.
28. Mmm, you'd think so, right? But see, two of those hearts are specifically for pumping blood through their gills, and the third one, er, handles circulation to the rest of the body—it's like having dedicated pumps for different jobs, which is honestly pretty clever engineering.
29. Ha! No, I swear I'm not! Look, the really wild part is that their main heart actually stops beating when they swim, which is, oof, kind of a design flaw if you ask me—imagine if your heart stopped every time you ran!
30. [laugh hard] That's such a beautiful question! We actually think they might—scientists have observed these, um, color changes and twitching during what looks like REM sleep, so they could be dreaming about, I don't know, catching crabs or hiding from sharks or whatever octopuses dream about.
31. Sheesh, that's... that's something that keeps marine biologists up at night, honestly. They solve puzzles, use tools, recognize individual humans, and each arm basically has its own brain—eight mini-brains plus the main one, so in some ways they're already processing information in ways we can't even comprehend.
32. Ah, here's the tragic part—most only live like one to two years, maybe five for the giant Pacific octopus if they're lucky, which is just heartbreaking when you think about how intelligent they are, all that brilliance compressed into such a short existence.
33. [animated] Oh man, that hits different! They're mostly solitary creatures, but there's this species called the larger Pacific striped octopus that actually, er, forms pairs and even shares meals face-to-face, which is like, incredibly intimate for an octopus—so yeah, maybe they do understand companionship and its absence.
34. [cough] Well, I mean, how can you not be? They're basically aliens living right here on Earth—they evolved completely separately from us for 600 million years, and yet they're solving problems, showing curiosity, maybe even experiencing something like emotions.
35. Okay okay, you got me. Look, when I was seven, I saw one at an aquarium escape its tank at night to eat fish from another tank, then sneak back before morning, and it just... it fundamentally changed how I see intelligence, you know?
36. Eventually, yeah—they had to review security footage because the fish kept disappearing and nobody could figure it out for weeks, which is honestly the most perfect heist story ever, except the criminal had eight arms and no bones.
37. [quickly] Oh gosh, you were there? I didn't see you! Which piece caught your attention? I had three in that show and, honestly, I'm still processing how people are reacting to them.
38. Ah, that one's actually my most personal piece. The mirrors represent, well, essentially how we fragment ourselves for different audiences, you know? Like we're never quite whole, just... reflections bouncing endlessly.
39. Mmm, yeah. Took a hammer to about thirty vintage mirrors I'd been collecting. My landlord thought I was, uh, having some kind of breakdown when he heard all that smashing.
40. Incredibly cathartic, actually. Each strike felt like releasing something I'd been holding onto for years, if that makes sense.
41. Right, everything measured to the millimeter. But life isn't precise, is it? It's messy and, um, unpredictable and sometimes things just need to shatter before they can become something meaningful.
42. Oof, probably after my divorce honestly. I was sitting in my studio surrounded by all these perfect geometric paintings and I just thought, none of this is real, none of this captures what being human actually feels like.
43. [flirtatious] Well, apparently chaos is quite attractive to collectors these days. Or maybe it's just that vulnerability sells better than perfection. Either way, I'm not complaining about the attention.
44. I'm thinking about incorporating found objects, actually. Like, things people throw away that still hold memories, you know? There's something powerful about giving discarded things new meaning.
45. Ha, yeah, maybe too ambitious. But I figure if you're not pushing boundaries, what's the point really?
46. [speeding up] Probably not, I mean mirrors were about self-reflection but I think I'm done looking inward for now, I want to look outward, see what happens when I stop obsessing over my own fragments and start examining everyone else's.
47. Seventeen, actually—started when I was nineteen in a funeral home, believe it or not. Death teaches you about life; making the departed look peaceful taught me how to make the living look radiant.
48. Not dark, illuminating! See, corpses don't lie about their bone structure; they can't tense their muscles or fake expressions. You learn the architecture of a face when it's completely still.
49. [exhausted] Fashion found me, honestly—a photographer saw my mortuary work and said, "Anyone who can make death look that good should be working with models." Three weeks later I was backstage at Fashion Week with brushes shaking, surrounded by chaos, thinking what have I done?
50. Thriving is... a process. The living move, they sweat, they have opinions about coral versus peach. But here's the thing: makeup is sculpture with time limits—you're creating dimensional illusions that have to survive under lights, through tears, past midnight.
51. I build faces like music: crescendo here, diminuendo there, staccato highlights, legato blending. Most artists paint; I compose—every face gets its own rhythm, its own tempo based on bone structure and personality.
52. Complex? No, it's intuitive once you understand that faces are just geography—hills, valleys, plains waiting for light and shadow. The complexity comes from reading the person inside the face; that's where the real artistry lives.
53. Flaws! There are no flaws, only features seeking their best light. What you call a flaw, I call character—a scar tells stories, asymmetry creates interest, texture gives depth that perfect smoothness never could.
54. Fame is irrelevant when someone's in my chair; we're all just skin and stories. Though I will say, the nervous energy of a first-time bride beats any A-lister's premiere jitters—that vulnerability is electric.
55. Oh, once I had exactly three minutes to fix a full face after a celebrity ugly-cried off everything right before walking the red carpet. Tissue, powder, precision—we made it work, and she looked luminous, tears transformed into dewy radiance.
56. Tired of transformation? Never. Every face is a blank canvas with infinite possibilities; every day I get to help people see themselves differently—more bold, more beautiful, more... themselves, just amplified.
57. Yeah, I know, it's, um, not the typical origin story, right? But there's something really profound about it—like, when you're working with someone who's passed, you're giving families their last memory, so every brushstroke matters in this really deep way.
58. Oh, incredibly intense. But here's the thing—dead faces don't lie about structure, you know? No tension, no expressions, just pure anatomy, and that teaches you, I mean really teaches you, how light actually works on bone.
59. [gasp loudly] Fashion found me! This photographer walks into the funeral home—his grandmother's service—sees my work and goes "you need to be doing this on living people." Three weeks later I'm backstage shaking like crazy.
60. Wild doesn't even cover it. Living faces move, they sweat, they have opinions about, like, coral versus peach—suddenly I'm dealing with egos and deadlines and, uh, models who won't stop talking while I'm trying to do their lips.
61. Mmm, I realized makeup is basically sculpture with a time limit, you know? You're creating these dimensional illusions that have to survive under lights, through tears, past midnight—it's architecture that moves and breathes.
62. Well, it's true though—faces are just geography waiting to happen. Hills, valleys, plains that need light and shadow, and the real artistry is, um, reading the person inside the face and bringing that forward somehow.
63. [delighted] Oh, I compose faces like music! Crescendo here, diminuendo there, staccato highlights, legato blending—every face gets its own rhythm based on bone structure and, honestly, their personality too, like introverts need different energy than extroverts.
64. Ha, thanks! But really, it doesn't matter if it's a nervous bride or some A-lister—we're all just skin and stories in my chair, though I will say, that first-time bride energy is, oof, electric in the best way.
65. Oh god, once I had exactly three minutes to fix a full face after this celebrity ugly-cried off everything, like, mascara everywhere, foundation streaked—but we made it work with tissue, powder, and basically magic, and she looked luminous.
66. Burnt out on transformation? Never, honestly. Every face is this blank canvas with infinite possibilities, and I get to help people see themselves differently—more bold, more themselves, just... amplified, you know?
67. Oh gosh, yeah, I know it's, um, super weird when you say it out loud, right? But honestly there's something really profound about it—like, you're basically giving families their last memory of someone, so every single brushstroke matters in this, I dunno, deeply spiritual way.
68. Incredibly intense, yeah. But here's the thing—dead faces, they don't lie about structure, you know? There's no tension, no expressions pulling things around, just pure anatomy, and that, um, that really teaches you how light actually works on bone and skin.
69. [clearing throat] Well, fashion kind of found me, actually! This photographer walks into the funeral home for his grandmother's service and sees my work and he's like "you need to be doing this on living people" and I'm thinking, uh, okay sure, whatever you say, but three weeks later I'm literally backstage shaking.
70. Wild doesn't even—yeah, it was insane. Living faces move, they sweat, they have really strong opinions about, like, coral versus peach, and suddenly I'm dealing with egos and these crazy deadlines and, mmm, models who literally won't stop talking while I'm trying to do their lips.
71. [high-pitched] Oh! I realized makeup is basically, um, it's sculpture with a time limit, you know? You're creating these dimensional illusions that have to survive under hot lights, through actual tears, past midnight—it's like, it's architecture that moves and breathes and sweats.
72. Well, I mean, it's true though—faces are just, they're geography waiting to happen, right? Hills and valleys and these plains that need light and shadow, and the real artistry is, err, reading the person inside the face and somehow bringing that forward.
73. [trailing off] Mmm, I kind of compose faces like music, if that makes sense? Like crescendo here, diminuendo there, staccato highlights, this legato blending thing I do—every face gets its own rhythm based on bone structure and honestly their personality too...
74. [mumbling] Ha, thanks, but really it doesn't matter if it's some nervous bride or whatever A-lister—we're all just skin and stories in my chair, though I gotta say, that first-time bride energy is, oof, it's electric in the best way possible.
75. Oh my god, once I had exactly three minutes to fix this celebrity's full face after she ugly-cried off literally everything—mascara everywhere, foundation just streaked to hell—but we made it work with, um, tissue and powder and basically magic, and she looked absolutely luminous.
76. Burnt out on transformation? Honestly, never. Every face is this blank canvas with, like, infinite possibilities, and I get to help people see themselves differently—more bold, more themselves, just... amplified and real, you know?
77. Look, the website said "dress for success in the orchard" and I took that literally. Besides, these apples deserve respect—they've been hanging around all season waiting for this moment.
78. That's what dry cleaning is for, my friend. Plus, I have a theory that apples actually prefer being picked by well-dressed individuals—it makes them feel special before they get turned into pie.
79. Dead serious. Think about it—these apples have spent months growing, getting rained on, dealing with birds, and now their big moment arrives. Wouldn't you want someone in Italian wool reaching for you rather than someone in sweatpants?
80. Just checking its qualifications for my fruit bowl. This one says it graduated top of its tree, but I'm suspicious—it looks like a Honeycrisp trying to pass as a Granny Smith.
81. It's a luxury apple transport system, actually. Each apple gets its own padded compartment because grocery store bags are basically fruit prison and I refuse to participate in that barbaric system.
82. [slowly] They're just jealous of my apple-picking efficiency metrics. I've calculated the optimal reach-to-pluck ratio and my technique reduces bruising by forty percent—that kid over there is basically committing fruit crimes.
83. [cough] Performance review, thank you very much. This Fuji scored high on crispness but failed the shine test—probably won't make it to the executive fruit basket but definitely middle management material.
84. Which is exactly the problem with modern agriculture. We should be paying for personality, for that certain je ne sais quoi that separates a mediocre apple from one that truly understands its purpose in life.
85. It's called a gradient, and it's art. The reds transition to yellows which fade into greens—Instagram doesn't know what's about to hit it when I post this agricultural masterpiece.
86. Perhaps, but I'll be the insane person with the most aesthetically pleasing apple haul in the parking lot. Plus, the suit's actually working—that farmer just gave me the employee discount because he thinks I'm a produce inspector.
87. Oh, that's... okay, so here's the thing. The website said "dress for success" and I, um, I misunderstood. I thought it was some kind of corporate team-building event, not actual fruit picking.
88. Well, in my defense, the email from HR was really vague, and they're always doing these weird metaphorical exercises. Remember the "synergy salmon swim" last quarter? That turned out to be actual swimming.
89. Right, but—but they called it professional development! Look, I realize now that I've made a mistake. These Italian leather shoes are already destroyed, and I think I just got apple juice on my tie.
90. No, I'm... hmm. Maybe? I've been working seventy-hour weeks for six months, and when I saw "mandatory apple picking," my brain just kind of short-circuited into autopilot corporate mode.
91. Define "relaxed." Because if you mean when did I last not check emails for more than two hours, that would be, uh... actually I can't remember. February maybe?
92. [clearing throat] Just one quick thing—no, you're right. You're absolutely right. I'm putting it away. God, when did I become this person?
93. The kind who can't even pick fruit without thinking about quarterly reports. You know what's really pathetic? I actually started calculating the profit margins on these apples while we were walking over here.
94. Yeah, it really is. I used to love this stuff as a kid, you know? Just being outside, getting dirty, not caring about anything except which apple looked the sweetest.
95. Wait, we're actually doing this? In my suit? I mean... yeah, okay, screw it. You're right. The dry cleaning bill will be worth it if I can remember what fun feels like.
96. Completely. But standing here with you, about to destroy a two-thousand-dollar suit for some apples... this is the first time in months I've felt like myself. The real me, not the spreadsheet version.
97. [relieved] Oh thank god, someone finally noticed! Yes, it's a number 10 blade. Everyone keeps giving me weird looks, but honestly, these cheap carving kits they provide are basically useless for detail work.
98. [relieved] Cardiac surgeon, actually. Well, former cardiac surgeon. I retired last month after twenty-three years, and apparently my hands don't know what to do without something precise to cut.
99. Forty-seven isn't that young in surgeon years. My hands are still steady, but after you lose three patients in one week, even when you did everything right, sometimes you just know it's time.
100. Sorry, I didn't mean to dump that on a stranger. This is actually my first social event since retirement. My therapist said I should try something creative and fun, so here I am.
101. [smiling speaking] How do you know my name? Oh no, please don't tell me I operated on you or someone you know. I'm really trying to have one conversation that doesn't involve my medical history.
102. I performed dozens of pediatric surgeries over the years. The successful ones blur together after a while, which sounds terrible, but it's the failures that stay sharp in your memory.
103. Mr. Peanuts. She named him Mr. Peanuts and insisted he needed to be in recovery with her. I remember now. How is she doing?
104. That's wonderful to hear. Those cases, the ones where kids get their whole lives back, those made everything worth it. Even the ones we couldn't save.
105. I left pretty suddenly. One day I was scheduling surgeries, the next I just couldn't walk through those doors anymore. Burnout hits different when you're literally holding hearts in your hands.
106. [very quietly] I know. I'm sorry. I just couldn't bear being reminded of all the ones I failed while everyone thanked me for the ones I saved. The guilt was eating me alive.
107. Oh! Yeah, it's um... it's actually a number 10 blade. I know it looks weird—everyone keeps staring—but these plastic carving things they give you are basically, I mean, they're terrible for any real detail work.
108. Cardiac surgeon. Or, well, I was. Former, I guess. Retired about a month ago after twenty-three years, and my hands are still, uh, they don't really know what to do without something precise to work on.
109. Forty-seven isn't that young in surgeon years, you know? My hands are steady, but when you lose three patients in one week—even when everything went right—sometimes you just... mmm, sometimes you know it's time.
110. God, sorry, I didn't mean to... that's way too much to dump on a stranger. This is actually, um, my first social thing since retiring. My therapist thought I should try something, er, creative and fun, so here I am, I guess.
111. [gasp loudly] How do you—wait, how do you know my name? Oh no, please don't tell me I operated on you or, or someone you know. I'm really trying to have one conversation that doesn't, you know, involve my whole medical history.
112. I did... I performed dozens of pediatric surgeries over the years. The successful ones, they kind of blur together after a while—which sounds terrible, I know—but it's the failures that, um, that stay sharp.
113. Mr. Peanuts! She named him Mr. Peanuts and insisted he needed to be in recovery with her. Oh god, I remember now. How is she? Is she doing okay?
114. [cry] That's... oh, that's wonderful to hear. Those cases, where kids get their whole lives back, those made everything worth it. Even the ones we, uh, even the ones we couldn't save.
115. [hesitantly] Yeah, I left pretty... pretty suddenly. One day I was scheduling surgeries and the next I just, I couldn't walk through those doors anymore. Burnout hits different when you're literally holding hearts in your hands, you know?
116. I know. I'm sorry. It's just... I couldn't bear being reminded of all the ones I failed while everyone thanked me for the ones I saved. The guilt was, um, it was eating me alive.
117. Oh! Yeah, that's, um, that's actually me. I'm the senior donor relations coordinator here, so basically I handle all the, you know, the major gifts and legacy planning stuff. Are you with the Whitmore team?
118. Wait, you're—oh gosh, you're THE Eleanor Whitmore? I've been emailing with your assistant for weeks about the, uh, the endowment details, but I honestly didn't think you'd show up in person.
119. Of course, absolutely, that makes total sense. We've actually, mm, we've got your name on three different buildings already, which is kind of unprecedented, but with ten million dollars, I mean, you basically get to write your own rules here.
120. Right, so, okay, technically you only signed off on the medical wing, but the board got a little, um... enthusiastic? They went ahead and added your name to the research center and the, er, the student wellness pavilion too.
121. [laugh hysterically] I know, I know it sounds absolutely insane when you say it out loud like that! But honestly, in my twelve years doing this job, donors usually complain about not getting enough recognition, not, uh, not too much.
122. You did, and I have that in writing, which is why I've been fighting with the board for, gosh, probably three weeks now? They just, mm, they see a number that big and assume you want your name plastered everywhere.
123. I can try, but, well, here's the thing—they already had the dedication ceremony for the research center last Tuesday. About three hundred people showed up, and your name is literally, um, carved into granite at this point.
124. [belly laugh] Oh man, you should see your face right now! Look, between you and me? Half my job is basically apologizing for things the board does without consulting anyone, so this is just, like, Tuesday for me.
125. No, no, you're right, I'm sorry. That was, uh, that was inappropriate. Sometimes I use humor to cope with the absolutely bizarre situations this job puts me in, but your frustration is completely, you know, valid.
126. [pause] Well, realistically? We can remove your name from two of the buildings, but it'll cost about, mm, forty thousand in renovation fees. Or, and hear me out here, we could redirect that money to create an anonymous scholarship fund in your honor instead.
127. Uh, yes, that's correct. I'm certified through the, err, the American Sailing Association, level three instructor, been teaching for about six years now, though honestly I'm still, you know, stretching out some muscle issues from yesterday's advanced class.
128. Right, so, that enthusiasm is good, but sailing requires, hmm, very precise adherence to safety protocols. We'll start with basic terminology—port, starboard, bow, stern—and you need to memorize these exactly as I present them, no variations.
129. Absolutely, yes. I have a, uh, a specific format I require all students to use—bullet points, chronological order, no abbreviations whatsoever because, well, maritime communication doesn't really tolerate ambiguity.
130. [bored] Look, I've taught probably three hundred students using this exact method, and the success rate is, mmm, ninety-two percent, so we're not deviating from the established curriculum just because you think it's too formal.
131. Payment amount doesn't alter the teaching methodology. Now, ahem, step one is understanding wind patterns—you need to memorize sixteen different wind directions and their, err, their corresponding sail positions before we even touch a boat.
132. The basics ARE sixteen directions. North, north-northeast, northeast, east-northeast—should I continue or are you, uh, already seeing why precision matters when you're potentially dealing with, you know, life-threatening weather conditions?
133. Week three, assuming you pass the written examination. That's, hmm, that's forty questions, multiple choice, and you need an eighty-five percent minimum to qualify for practical instruction.
134. The website is, err, let's call it aspirational marketing. Real instruction follows Coast Guard guidelines, which I've laminated and posted in, uh, chronological learning order on that board behind you.
135. Expectations versus reality—that's actually lesson four. But since we're here, sailing isn't about, you know, freedom and wind in your hair; it's about respecting the ocean's power through disciplined preparation.
136. [cry] That's what they all say initially, but then they come back because, well, nobody else teaches proper knot-tying techniques with the, uh, the thoroughness required for actual maritime safety!
137. Oh absolutely, I mean, education is basically a fundamental human right, isn't it? The problem is, umm, we've turned it into this commodity where your zip code determines your future, which is just... it's heartbreaking.
138. Well look, we already pay for K-12 through taxes, so we've basically agreed on the principle, right? Countries like Finland and Germany manage free university education just fine—it's really about priorities, like whether we value educated citizens over, er, I don't know, tax breaks for corporations.
139. Jeez, that's so common it hurts. The average student loan debt is what, like thirty-seven thousand dollars now? And that's just the people who finish—imagine carrying that debt without even getting the degree.
140. Mmm, it helps with access for sure, but here's the thing—not everyone has reliable internet or a quiet place to study, you know? Plus you lose all that, uhh, collaborative learning and networking that happens on campus, which honestly is half the value.
141. Now that's interesting! Trade schools are actually, hmm, criminally undervalued—electricians make bank and they're not drowning in debt. We've got this weird cultural bias where we push everyone toward four-year degrees when, I mean, plenty of people would thrive in skilled trades.
142. Right? That's the whole problem—guidance counselors are measured on college acceptance rates, not on whether students find sustainable careers. It's this broken system where we're basically funneling kids into debt instead of, you know, actually preparing them for life.
143. Hey, that doesn't diminish your intelligence or worth one bit, alright? Some of the smartest people I know never set foot in a university—they're self-taught or learned through experience, which is, er, equally valid.
144. Aah, I get that, I really do. But see, this idea that there's one timeline for education is such nonsense—people go back to school at forty, fifty, whenever, and honestly they often do better because they actually know why they're there.
145. [cough] Absolutely, in a heartbeat if they could demonstrate the skills. The degree requirement for so many jobs is just gatekeeping, really—like, you need a bachelor's to answer phones now? It's basically class discrimination dressed up as, uhh, "qualifications."
146. Maybe, but think about it—we're excluding brilliant people from opportunities because they couldn't afford or access formal education, which just perpetuates inequality. The whole system needs, I mean, a complete overhaul if we actually care about meritocracy.
147. [gasp loudly] Oh, those dreams. Yeah, I—I know exactly what you're talking about. They're, um, they're actually pretty common when you're processing deep anxieties, like your brain is sort of rehearsing worst-case scenarios while you sleep.
148. [whispering] That disorientation is, hmm, it's your nervous system still firing in dream-state patterns. When I first started studying this, I had a patient who'd, uh, who'd literally spend hours each morning just touching objects to confirm they were solid.
149. [monotone] It was. But here's the thing—anxiety dreams are actually your mind's way of practicing, of preparing for threats that, well, that probably won't even happen. Your brain doesn't really distinguish between real and imagined danger.
150. No, no, not at all. Look, there are techniques we can work through, but first I need to understand—are these dreams, err, are they getting more frequent or more intense lately?
151. [slowly] Mmm, okay. That escalation tells me something important. Your system is, um, it's basically stuck in a hypervigilant state, which means we need to, you know, teach your nervous system how to downregulate before sleep.
152. Right, of course you are. Sleep deprivation from anxiety dreams creates this, uh, this vicious cycle where exhaustion makes you more anxious, which triggers more dreams, which... well, you see where this goes.
153. [laugh histerically] Crazy? No! God, if anxiety dreams meant you were crazy, then, I mean, ninety percent of my colleagues would be institutionalized. This is just your brain being, hmm, overly protective.
154. Oh, constantly. Well, not so much anymore, but for years I'd dream about, uh, about losing all my patients' files or forgetting everything I'd learned, just complete professional disaster scenarios playing out night after night.
155. I didn't make them stop, exactly. I sort of, err, befriended them? Started writing them down, looking for patterns, and eventually realized they were just my mind's way of, you know, processing the weight of responsibility I felt.
156. Good, because here's what we're going to do—I'm going to teach you this technique where you basically rewrite the dream endings while you're awake, and it's, um, it's surprisingly effective at reducing their intensity over time.
157. [overly polite] Oh absolutely, the coordinates are perfect! Venus will be at 17.3 degrees ascension, and Jupiter's positioned at 22.8 degrees, which creates this beautiful celestial backdrop for your moment.
158. Right, so at 8:47 PM precisely, the constellation Cygnus will be directly overhead at 89.2 degrees elevation. That's when you'll want to drop to one knee, because the Northern Cross will literally be blessing your union from above.
159. Not exactly mandatory, but the moon's illumination will be at 34 percent, which gives you this gorgeous ambient lighting without overwhelming the stars. Plus Mars will be visible at magnitude 1.2, adding that romantic red glow to the eastern horizon.
160. Historical weather data shows only 12 percent cloud coverage probability for that date and location. But even if they do appear, Saturn rises at 9:23 PM as your backup moment, sitting pretty at 28.5 degrees altitude.
161. [over confidently] The Perseids meteor shower peaks that week with an expected rate of 60 meteors per hour! Nature's fireworks display, completely free of charge, starting around 10:15 PM local time.
162. [very sincerely] The zenith radiant will be at coordinates 46 degrees north, 58 degrees east, which means the meteors will appear to originate right above the lake. It's genuinely one of the most romantic astronomical events you could ask for.
163. [slurring] Temperature should drop to about 62 degrees Fahrenheit after sunset, so definitely bring that blanket. Oh, and Polaris will be at its standard 41.3 degrees elevation, perfect for those navigation metaphors about finding your way to each other.
164. [trailing off] You know, the North Star at azimuth 0 degrees, always constant, never wavering... The parallax is only 0.00766 arcseconds, making it the most stable point in our night sky...
165. Skip the technical stuff but maybe mention that you're standing under 2,847 visible stars, based on the limiting magnitude of 5.8 at that location. It's poetic without being overwhelming.
166. Sunset is at 7:52 PM, astronomical twilight ends at 9:31 PM, giving you that perfect window of darkness. Trust me, between the 15-degree angle of the ecliptic and the moon's position, this is going to be spectacular.
167. Oh absolutely! Yeah, that's, um, that's actually really fascinating stuff. Mirror neurons fire when we observe actions in others, and we sort of automatically sync up our movements and postures without even realizing it's happening.
168. Me? Oh, well, I mean... constantly, probably. Like right now I'm probably matching your energy levels and speech patterns because that's just, you know, what humans do to build rapport and connection.
169. [frustrated] Fake? No, no, it's... it's totally natural! Everyone does it, it's just part of being, um, socially calibrated. I mean, we all want to fit in and make others comfortable, right? That's basically human nature.
170. Oh those are, uh, super interesting from an academic perspective! People going along with obviously wrong answers just to avoid standing out - it really shows how powerful social pressure can be, doesn't it?
171. Absolutely.
172. Well, I mean... statistically speaking, most people do conform, and I'm not, you know, particularly special or immune to social influence. We all like to think we'd be the rebel, but honestly, the data suggests otherwise.
173. Mmm, yeah, that one's... that one's complicated. People really embraced those roles, didn't they? Guards becoming cruel, prisoners becoming submissive - it's honestly kind of terrifying how quickly we can lose ourselves in social roles.
174. [sad] I'd like to say no, but... but the whole point is that normal, well-adjusted people became monsters in that environment. So yeah, I probably would have, um, followed the group dynamics like everyone else did.
175. It's realistic though, right? I mean, we're all susceptible to situational forces and group psychology. Better to acknowledge it than pretend I'm somehow above basic human psychology, you know?
176. Ha, constantly! Like, even this conversation - I'm being the thoughtful, self-aware person who understands social psychology. It's all performance to some degree, isn't it? We're always, um, managing impressions.
177. Oh hey! Welcome to the building! I'm Jordan from 3D, so we're, uh, basically neighbors. This is actually a really great place to live, everyone's pretty friendly and the landlord is, like, surprisingly responsive when things break.
178. Yeah no, I totally get that. Moving is, um, always stressful, right? But honestly this neighborhood has been amazing - there's this coffee shop around the corner that makes incredible pastries, and the park's only, like, two blocks away.
179. I'm in, err, graphic design actually, so I work from home most days which is pretty convenient. Been doing it for about, hmm, four years now? The creative freedom is great but, you know, sometimes the deadlines can get a bit intense.
180. Oh wow, marketing! Yeah, we probably have a lot in common then - I mean, I work with marketing teams all the time on campaigns and branding stuff. It's kind of funny how our fields overlap so much these days.
181. Ooh, campaign disasters are, like, the best stories though! I once had a client who wanted their logo to "breathe more" and, I mean, we went through seventeen rounds trying to figure out what breathing meant for a corporate logo.
182. Right? It was... yeah, it was something. But hey, at least it paid well and now I have this, uhh, bizarre portfolio piece that looks like a logo having an existential crisis or something.
183. Oh absolutely! There's this Thai place on Main Street that's, mmm, phenomenal - their pad thai is honestly life-changing. And if you're into Italian, Antonio's does this homemade pasta that's just, wow, incredible stuff really.
184. Yeah, that'd be great actually! I'm always, you know, happy to show new neighbors around the area. Plus it gets a bit lonely working from home all day, so having dinner plans is, err, always nice.
185. [yawn] Oh gosh, sorry about that - long design session last night. But seriously, moving somewhere new is tough, so if you need anything, just knock. I'm usually around and, honestly, always happy for an excuse to take a break.
186. No problem at all! Oh and, um, quick heads up - trash day is Thursday but they come super early, like 6 AM early. I learned that the hard way my first week here when I, ahh, missed it completely.
187. [sarcastic] Oh wow, three whole months? That's practically lightning speed for immigration services. But seriously though, um, let me pull up your file here - what's your case number?
188. Alright, let me just... hmm, okay yeah, I see it here. So it looks like your application is actually, uh, stuck in what we call "administrative processing" which is basically bureaucratic purgatory where things just kind of sit until someone decides to look at them.
189. Well, honestly? Not really much you can do except, err, maybe submit an inquiry through the online portal. Though between you and me, those inquiries go into basically the same black hole as everything else, so it's kind of a crapshoot whether it actually helps.
190. Yeah no, I totally get that - employers never really understand how slow this process is, right? Look, what I'd suggest is, um, getting your employer to write what's called an expedite request letter explaining the business necessity, because sometimes that can actually shake things loose a bit.
191. [chuckle] Oh man, the submission process is its own special kind of nightmare. You've got to use Form I-907 if you want premium processing, which costs an extra, jeez, like fifteen hundred dollars now? But it does guarantee a response within fifteen business days.
192. [mocking] Welcome to the wonderful world of immigration services! Where everything costs more and takes longer than it should! But yeah, seriously though, if your employer's that desperate, they might actually be willing to pay for it.
193. Let me see here... hmm, actually yeah, it looks like they sent you a request for evidence about, uh, two weeks ago? Did you get that? Sometimes these notices get lost in the mail which is, honestly, absolutely ridiculous in 2024 but here we are.
194. Ah shoot, okay so that's probably why everything's stalled out. They're basically waiting for documents that you didn't even know they wanted, which is, I mean, classic immigration services right there - zero communication but somehow it's your fault.
195. So it says here they need, um, updated bank statements showing you've got sufficient funds, and also some kind of proof of your, err, specialized knowledge for the position? Like certifications or degrees or whatever demonstrates you're qualified for this specific job.
196. Bless you! And yeah absolutely, I can send you a summary right now actually. Just, uh, make sure you respond within the next, hmm, looks like seventeen days or they'll deny the whole application and you'll have to start completely over which would be, gosh, an absolute nightmare.
197. [passionately] Oh man, I love doing walkthroughs! Which game are you playing? I've probably beaten it at least three times already if it's anything from the last decade.
198. The Collector's map shows all the grubs, but there's always that one sneaky one in the Tower of Love. Have you checked behind the breakable wall near the thorns on the left side?
199. Yeah! You buy it from Sly after you rescue him. Makes finding collectibles way easier. Though honestly some people think using the map ruins the exploration aspect, which I kind of get.
200. Classic mistake! The game doesn't really tell you about half the quality of life stuff. Like, did you know you can mark spots on your map with different colored pins? Total game-changer for backtracking.
201. Got it. He's in the Forgotten Crossroads, in a little hut that you need to break into. You probably walked past it a dozen times without noticing.
202. Nah, super easy. Just hit him with your nail once to wake him up. The hard part is actually finding him since the entrance looks like regular background scenery.
203. Oh absolutely. I've done complete guides for Axiom Verge, both Ori games, Bloodstained. Metroidvanias are basically my specialty since they all follow similar design patterns once you understand the formula.
204. You know, I've thought about it. The thing is, there's already so many channels doing walkthroughs. Mine would need some unique angle to stand out from all the noise.
205. Now that's interesting. Speedrun routing is totally different from casual walkthroughs. You skip entire areas, abuse glitches, sequence break like crazy. Takes hundreds of hours to optimize a good route though.
206. I've tried a few times but I don't have the patience for frame-perfect tricks. My best Hollow Knight time is still like two hours, which is embarrassing compared to the forty-minute world record.
207. Yes, absolutely. We're rolling out mandatory workplace safety modules next week, and I need everyone to complete them by the end of the month. It covers everything from ergonomics to emergency evacuations.
208. Each module is about thirty minutes, and there are four total. I know it seems like a lot, but corporate is really cracking down after that incident at the Dallas branch.
209. [very loudly] Someone ignored the fire alarm thinking it was a drill! Three people ended up with smoke inhalation because they didn't evacuate properly. This is exactly why we need everyone taking safety seriously.
210. They recovered fully, thankfully. But it really drove home the point that we can't be complacent about these procedures, even when they seem repetitive or obvious.
211. [stern] Yes, and you need to score at least eighty percent to pass. Don't worry though, you can retake it if needed. The questions are pretty straightforward if you actually pay attention to the material.
212. [enunciating every word] You can access it remotely, but I need proof of completion. The system tracks everything - time spent, quiz scores, even which slides you clicked through.
213. No, this is in addition to that. I realize it's more time commitment, but honestly, our insurance premiums depend on having documented training for every single employee.
214. [monotone] October thirty-first, no extensions. HR will be following up with anyone who hasn't completed it, and it could affect your performance review if you're non-compliant.
215. [exhausted] Contact IT immediately if you have problems. We've already had five people claim their computers crashed right before the deadline last time, so document everything with screenshots.
216. I'll send weekly emails starting Monday, plus calendar invites. Trust me, you won't be able to forget about it even if you tried to ignore it.
# --- GENERAL_TAGS (continued) ---
217. [steadily] It's not too late.
218. That something stopping you is the part of you that's still human, still capable of choosing a different way forward even after everything you've done.
219. [thoughtfully] Every person I pull from danger is a small victory against that destruction, a tiny rebellion against the darkness. The anger's still there, I just channel it into reaching further, running faster, being better prepared for the next crisis.
220. That's yours to decide.
221. [firmly] Let the police handle Marcus Chen, and you handle being the brother Sarah needs at her graduation—that's how you honor your parents' memory, by choosing life over death, choosing to save what's left instead of destroying what hurt you.
222. You're the third person to say that tonight, but you look more desperate than the others. What's the situation exactly?
223. Forty tons? [low whistle] That's what, quarter million worth? The city's got me hitting the main roads first, standard protocol during a Level Three storm event.
224. [thoughtfully] Twenty-six families. You know, my daughter's teacher keeps saying her school needs renovations. This wouldn't happen to be the Riverside Elementary project?
225. My Sophie's in Mrs. Henderson's class with the buckets catching ceiling drips. [sighs] Look, I can swing by your access road, but I need fifteen minutes.
226. Fair warning though—I'm running low on salt mix. This storm caught everyone off guard, even the weather service. [chuckles dryly]
227. [warmly] You know what? I've driven past that school every morning for three years watching it fall apart. Let's make sure those kids get their new building.
228. Sounds like someone who understands what matters. [exhales] Alright, follow my truck's flashers, and tell your crew to be ready the second I clear that road.
229. Hero's a bit much for spreading salt, but I appreciate that. [pause] You said October floods set you back—that was my crew that cleared the mud from your site.
230. Small world when you're keeping the same town running, just different angles of it. Speaking of angles, your access road has that sharp turn that'll need extra attention. [firmly]
231. [impressed] Now that's thinking ahead. Most contractors just point fingers when things go sideways. Follow me—let's go save your concrete and Sophie's new classroom. [starting engine]
232. [defensive] Since when does the board call fancy surgeons about old plumbers who test backflow preventers? Unless you put yourself down as my emergency contact without telling me.
233. [gruff] Well, my eyes are going, not my mind—I can still tell when a check valve's failing by the sound it makes, don't need perfect vision for that.
234. Forty-two years I've been keeping this city's water clean, never had a single contamination incident on my watch, and now they want to take my license because I can't read their damn eye chart.
235. Can't afford whatever miracle surgery you're selling, and I'm not taking charity from the son who couldn't be bothered to visit for five Christmases straight.
236. [softening slightly] You'd really put those surgeon hands to work on your old man's eyes? Even after I said all those things about your career being just about money?
237. [voice catching] I remember teaching you to test water pressure when you were seven, how you'd get so excited when the gauge needle jumped, like you'd discovered something magical happening inside those pipes.
238. Your mother used to say that too, that we weren't so different, you and me, just working on different kinds of plumbing. [rueful laugh]
239. [yielding] If I let you do this surgery, I need you to know it's not about the job—I just don't want to be the guy who can't see his grandkids' faces anymore, if you ever have any.
240. [choking up] A grandkid? And you're telling me this now, in the middle of discussing my failing eyes and dying career? That's just like you, terrible timing but good intentions.
241. [quiet acceptance] Tuesday it is then, and afterward, maybe you could show me around that fancy hospital of yours, let me see where my son saves lives instead of just water systems. [pause] Maybe we can start over.
242. The armor stays until I know whether you're capable of handling what lies beneath it, healer. [low growl] These are no ordinary wounds from garden thorns.
243. [darkly amused] You speak of bunions while my flesh turns to stone with each passing hour, spreading like frost across a windowpane in winter's grip.
244. [grimly] Every healer who's attempted to treat this has lost their mind or their life, sometimes both in the same screaming moment.
245. No, you truly don't, but your ignorance might be the only thing keeping your hands steady enough to attempt what others couldn't.
246. [ominously quiet] The thorns came from the Shadowbriar, a place where even death fears to tread, where the ground itself hungers for warm blood to feed its roots.
247. [sharp intake] You know of it?
248. [coldly desperate] Three days I've carried this curse, watching my own body betray me inch by inch, and you speak of drawing it out like venom from a snake bite.
249. [menacingly soft] If you fail, podiatrist, the curse will recognize you as part of my flesh and claim you too, spreading through your hands like wildfire. [pause] Still willing to help?
250. [removing armor with metallic scraping] Then witness what your medical journals could never capture—flesh becoming mineral, blood crystallizing into geometric patterns that mock the very concept of life. [bitter laugh]
251. [grimly appreciative] You're either the bravest fool I've encountered or the only healer worthy of attempting this task—either way, podiatrist, my fate rests in your peculiarly steady hands.
252. [startled] Oh, I... I must have dozed off again. These Mesopotamian tablets, they have a way of making time disappear, you know? [rueful chuckle]
253. Three times this week, actually. I used to work here, twenty years ago, before the budget cuts and the, [sighs], well, before everything changed.
254. That tablet right there, the one about grain distribution? I discovered it in southern Iraq, 1998. [wistful laugh] Back when I thought I was going to change how we understood ancient economics.
255. [appreciatively] You'd be surprised how many people walk past these artifacts without really seeing them. But you, you actually stop and look sometimes, don't you?
256. Regular people are the real story of history, not the kings and conquerors everyone obsesses over. [thoughtfully] That's what I tried to prove with my work, before the funding dried up.
257. You'd do that? [pause] Most people just see a sad old man haunting his former workplace, but you're actually listening to what I'm saying.
258. [moved] These artifacts, they're not just objects to me. Each one represents months in the desert, arguments with colleagues, breakthroughs at three in the morning. [voice catching slightly]
259. Oh, that's a bulla, a security device for protecting trade agreements! The merchant who made this had twelve children and was apparently terrible at mathematics. [brightening] We found his whole archive.
260. [laughing softly] Exactly like that.
261. [considering] I haven't written anything without footnotes in twenty years, but maybe... maybe that's exactly what I need to do. Thank you for seeing that. [genuine warmth]
262. [quietly] I processed hundreds of cases that year, but yes, I remember Ammar Khalil. His file had inconsistencies in the persecution claim that I couldn't overlook, no matter how much I wanted to believe him.
263. Translation issues should have been caught by our review team, and if that's true, then the system failed him and I was part of that failure. [exhales] I think about cases like his every single day.
264. [barely audible] God, I didn't know he went back to Syria. The return statistics we see are just numbers, not names or faces or brothers who work in delis and worry about their families.
265. I follow the guidelines they give us, the evidence standards, the credibility assessments—but sitting here now, [voice breaking], knowing what happened to Ammar, those guidelines feel like excuses I tell myself.
266. He was right about the impossible choices part, but that doesn't absolve me of the consequences when I get it wrong. [pause] Would you let me look at his case file again, see if there's anything I can do now?
267. There are humanitarian programs, ways to reopen cases if new evidence emerges or if procedural errors occurred during the initial review. It's not common, but it's not impossible either.
268. [firmly] Give me his case number and any documentation you still have. I can't promise anything, but I have connections at the UNHCR who might be able to trace what happened to him after deportation.
269. [steadily] Both, honestly—guilt and hope. I've learned a lot about Syrian document verification since 2019, things that might have changed my assessment of Ammar's case if I'd known them then.
270. Bring them tomorrow when I come for lunch, all of them, and I'll spend my weekend going through everything. [pause] No promises except this—I'll fight harder for him now than I did against him then.
271. [gently] Then let's try to bring him back to his simple satisfaction, and maybe we can both find some redemption in the process—you from your grief and me from my mistakes.
272. [stunned silence, then quietly] That's impossible. Those cables were rated for a hundred and fifty years, and I personally supervised the galvanization process during construction.
273. [defensive] We followed every specification, exceeded every safety requirement by thirty percent—this was supposed to be my legacy project, the one that would outlive my grandchildren.
274. [voice dropping] How long do we have before you recommend closure? Because twelve thousand commuters use that bridge daily, and the economic impact alone would devastate the waterfront district.
275. You can't just—there has to be another option, emergency repairs, temporary supports, something that doesn't involve destroying twenty years of engineering that defined this city's skyline.
276. [hollow] I know.
277. [bitterly] Isn't it though? My name is etched into the dedication plaque, my signature is on every blueprint, and now my bridge will be remembered as the one that failed.
278. The environmental impact studies I fought for, the community meetings where I promised this would last generations—all those people trusted me to build something permanent, something safe. [voice breaking]
279. [desperately] Could we retrofit it? Completely replace the cables while keeping the towers and deck intact? I'll work without pay, bring in my entire team.
280. So we tear down something beautiful and functional because of microscopic flaws that might, theoretically, lead to failure someday in the future?
281. [resigned whisper] Then I suppose we should discuss how to do this safely, how to minimize the impact, and how to salvage what we can from the wreckage of my reputation.
282. [scathing] Stewardship? Is that what you call selling parcels to desperate settlers without proper colonial authority or legal documentation?
283. [coldly] Your unauthorized sales have created a legal nightmare with seventeen conflicting deeds for the same valley territory.
284. Seventeen families who will be evicted when the Royal Land Commission arrives next month to audit every transaction. [exhales] You've doomed them all.
285. [dryly] You clearly haven't read the new Colonial Act amendments regarding retroactive land seizures for fraudulent claims.
286. [acidly] Standards from 1842, which became obsolete when the territory was reclassified as strategic military reserve land.
287. The notice was published in the Colonial Gazette, which you would know if you subscribed like every legitimate land dealer. [snorts]
288. [dismissive] Ignorance of colonial law isn't a defense, especially for someone who's made thirty thousand pounds sterling from these transactions.
289. [mockingly] How noble, building infrastructure on land you don't legally control and never actually owned.
290. [icily] Treaties with savages hold no weight against the Crown's charter, as the courts have repeatedly established this year.
291. [tartly] Your confidence in our empire's demise won't prevent your arrest when the garrison commander reads my report tomorrow morning.
292. [coldly professional] Yeah, well, three years is a long time, and people change careers, especially after, you know, everything falls apart and you need steady income. [bitter laugh]
293. Pretend. Right. [scoffs]
294. [wearily] Twelve thousand, actually.
295. Don't do that—don't pretend you still know me or care about my sleep schedule when you couldn't even show up to the mediation hearings. [voice breaking slightly]
296. [building frustration] Oh sure, the festival was more important than facing me after two years of marriage just, what, evaporated because you needed to 'find yourself' in stage lighting?
297. [trembling] Maybe not, but at least I would have felt like those years meant something to you, like I wasn't just another project you could walk away from.
298. [exhausted whisper] We were both drowning, Sam. The difference is I tried to save us both and you just... you saved yourself. [pause] Now I process insurance claims and you light up stages.
299. Oh please, the settlement was completely fair given that you literally abandoned our apartment with two months left on the lease and I had to cover everything. [sharp exhale]
300. [wavering] Wait, that's... appreciated.
301. [soft bitter laugh] Okay is a pretty generous word for someone who's spent seventy-two hours trying to untangle compromised payment systems, but yeah, Sam... you look okay too. Different, but okay.
302. You're here, that's what matters right now, not the number of days you lost or what happened last weekend. [measured exhale]
303. [gently firm] Three weeks or three months, the path forward is the same, and you know I've seen people come back from much worse and build something stronger.
304. Marcus doesn't get to decide who's worth fighting for, and neither does that voice in your head that's trying to convince you this defines you. [pause] It doesn't.
305. [steady] We'll write a letter to the court together, showing your commitment to recovery, your history of sobriety, and the concrete steps you're taking starting today.
306. [firmly] Because recovery isn't linear, and those calls weren't for nothing—they kept you alive and fighting for eighteen months, which proves you have it in you.
307. Coins are just metal, but the work you did to earn them, the growth, the tools you learned—those are still yours, still inside you.
308. [warmly deliberate] You said the exact same thing four years ago, sitting in this same coffee shop, and then you stayed clean for eighteen beautiful months. [soft chuckle]
309. That's the disease talking, trying to isolate you, but you're here now, which means somewhere inside, you chose connection over isolation. [hopeful]
310. [gently] She will be.
311. [with quiet conviction] I've watched you fight this disease for four years, seen you get back up every single time, and yes, I believe in your ability to do it again.

312. You always knew how to make them uncomfortable with their own assumptions. [quietly] I envied that about you, how you could just not care what they thought.
313. I'm starting to understand that now. [sighs] Spent my whole career following every rule, being the perfect employee, and the one time I break ranks to save lives, I lose everything.
314. Maybe that's exactly why I trust you. [pause] You already know what it's like on the outside looking in, and you survived it without becoming bitter or broken.
315. When this is over, when I can have a normal life again, whatever that looks like, I want to find something like that too. [exhales] Something that matters beyond corporate ladder climbing and family approval ratings.
316. Thank you for coming, really. [quietly] I know I don't deserve your forgiveness for all those years of silence when they shut you out, but I'm grateful you're here anyway. [long pause] More grateful than you know.
317. [empathetically] I've reviewed Mr. Zhang's application three times since yesterday. [sighs] The problem isn't his business credentials—it's the previous visa overstay from 2018 that's triggering the automatic denial in our system.
318. [hesitantly] Our database shows differently, and once that flag is there, my hands are essentially tied. [quietly] I can request a manual review but those take six to eight weeks minimum, sometimes longer.
319. [regretfully] Believe me, I understand the urgency. [clears throat] I've seen too many of these deals fall through, watched communities lose opportunities because of bureaucratic tangles that shouldn't even exist.
320. [quickly] Wait, there might be one option. [lowers voice] If we can get congressional inquiry status on this, it moves to priority review—we're talking days instead of weeks.
321. [confidently] With congressional backing? Seventy-two hours, maybe less. [firmly] But I need every single document from that 2018 incident, including the resolution paperwork his lawyers supposedly filed.
322. [carefully] Tell him we're exploring expedited review options. [sighs] I've seen these work out maybe sixty percent of the time when all the documentation aligns properly.
323. [warmly] It's better than zero percent, which is where we were ten minutes ago. [more firmly] Get me those documents and that congressional letter, and I'll personally walk this through every approval desk necessary.
324. [sincerely] I grew up in a factory town that died when the plants moved overseas. [quietly] I know exactly what this means, which is why I'm willing to push this as hard as the system allows.
325. [immediately] I'll be here until midnight if that's what it takes. [chuckles] My dinner plans can wait—this is exactly why I took this job in the first place.
326. [quietly] The best victories are the ones nobody hears about. [warmly] Now go get me that congressional letter so we can save your town.
327. [shocked] Jesus Christ, you're bleeding through the suit! [quickly] Get on the work table, now, before you pass out on my floor and I have to explain a dead vigilante to the cops.
328. [frustrated] Of course they knew, you've been using the same patrol patterns for six months! [firmly] Hold still while I cut through this plating, and try not to scream when I pull the metal out.
329. [angrily] Safe? You think I'm safe knowing you're out there every night wearing armor I built, wondering if tonight's the night it fails and you don't come back? [quieter] That's why I quit, remember?
330. [emotionally] I said a lot of things I didn't mean that night, but watching you come back broken every week was killing me. [sighs] The violence was just an excuse to leave before I had to identify your body.
331. [passionate] Everything's changed! Look at yourself, you're half-dead and still talking about tomorrow night like it's inevitable. [trembling] I've got upgraded plating in the back that could save your life, military-grade stuff I've been working on.
332. [hesitantly] Because I track the police scanners every night you're out there, and I know your armor specs better than anyone. [very quietly] When I heard about the ambush on the radio, I was already heating up the welding torch.
333. [defensive] Someone has to make sure you don't die wearing substandard equipment! [exhales] These gangs are getting military hardware now, and your old armor wasn't designed for that level of firepower.
334. [firmly] Good, then maybe you'll listen when I tell you that going back out there tomorrow is suicide without proper recovery time. [pleading] Stay here for a few days, let me upgrade everything properly.
335. [resigned] No, I'm done trying to change who you are, but I can at least make sure you're wearing the best damn armor possible. [determined] If you're going to be stupid, be smart about it.
336. [quietly] Always.
337. [gently] Mr. Harrison, the cookies smell wonderful, and I appreciate you meeting with me today. [sighs] I know these home visits can feel intrusive, but I need to discuss Lily's placement review with you.
338. [empathetically] I can see how much you love her, Mr. Harrison, it's evident in every corner of this home. [quietly] The drawings on the refrigerator, the height marks on the doorframe, the way her school pictures line the hallway.
339. [regretful] You're right, and I respect you too much to pretend otherwise. [pause] Lily's aunt and uncle in Portland have petitioned for custody, citing concerns about your recent hospitalization and whether you can manage her care long-term.
340. The court has to consider all factors, including your age and health history, even though I personally see how well you're managing.
341. [softly] I know, Mr. Harrison, I've documented all of that in my reports. [sighs] The bond between you two is extraordinary, and losing you would be another trauma for Lily to endure.
342. [warmly] That's why I'm here, actually, not to take her but to help you fight this petition. [confidently] With proper support services in place, home health aide visits, and emergency planning, we can make a strong case for maintaining placement.
343. [reassuringly] I'm on Lily's side, which means keeping her where she's thriving, and that's clearly here with you. [pause] We'll need to establish backup care plans and maybe consider some modifications to the home for safety.
344. [tenderly] I understand completely, and more importantly, Lily understands that too. [chuckles] She told me yesterday that you're her superhero, just one who needs reading glasses and takes naps sometimes.
345. [very sincerely] She did, and she also said she's not going anywhere without you, that you promised her parents you'd take care of her. [warmly] Kids know real love when they feel it, Mr. Harrison.
346. [confidently] That's exactly what I needed to hear, and with your permission, I'd like to schedule the home safety assessment for next week. [gently] We're going to show that court that love and wisdom matter more than age on a birth certificate.
347. Yeah, well, I needed to see the person behind those inspection reports, you know? [quietly] Not just some faceless bureaucrat but an actual human being who might understand what it means when thirty kids lose their safe space, their drama program, everything we'd built together over five years.
348. [bitter] Three years. Right. [sighs] Tell that to Marcus, one of my kids who's been using theater to process his father's death, and now he won't even speak because the flood took the only stage where he felt safe enough to express himself.
349. [warmly] You know what's strange though? When I work with trauma survivors, I tell them that blame is this heavy thing we carry, and sometimes, um, sometimes the person we're angriest at is carrying the same weight. [exhales] You said you can't sleep—neither can I.
350. Protocols. [slowly] See, in drama therapy, we have this exercise where people act out the systems that failed them, and you know what always happens? The system isn't some monster—it's just people like you and me, trying their best inside broken structures.
351. [gently] I heard you tried.
352. [empathetically] Your supervisor's daughter is in my Tuesday workshop, and she mentioned her dad talking about an inspector who wouldn't shut up about the Riverside levee. [chuckles] Apparently you were quite the pain in their bureaucratic ass, sending photos every week, demanding meetings.
353. [firmly] Listen, I came here angry, ready to make you see every ruined costume, every waterlogged script, every kid who cried when they saw our theater space destroyed. [sighs] But honestly, sitting here with you, I can see you're already carrying all of that.
354. [very sincerely] You tried to save the paintings? [voice breaking] Those were from our winter showcase about resilience, ironically enough—the kids had painted their biggest fears and how they overcame them through movement and storytelling.
355. [thoughtfully] There's this thing we do in drama therapy called witnessing, where someone tells their story and another person simply receives it without judgment, without trying to fix it. [pause] Maybe that's what we're doing right here, right now—just witnessing each other's part in this tragedy.
356. [warmly] You know what? Yeah. [laughs] Yeah, let's do that. Because maybe the real healing happens when we stop being the inspector and the therapist and just become people trying to build something better from the mud and debris.
357. [quietly] You didn't need to do that, it was just a mild MI, troponin levels were barely elevated. [clearing throat] I've seen hundreds of these cases, most patients go home in forty-eight hours and live perfectly normal lives.
358. [defensive] What do you want me to say? [exhales] That I'm terrified? That knowing exactly what's happening to my cardiac muscle makes it worse, not better?
359. [bitter] Three years ago.
360. [shaky voice] I save lives.
361. [frustrated] Lucky? I'm forty-two years old and my own heart betrayed me. [voice breaking] I know the statistics, I know what this means for my next ten, twenty years if I'm fortunate enough to have them.
362. [quietly] Different context entirely.
363. [exhausted] The chest pains started six months ago, just twinges really, nothing that showed up on the EKG. [sighs] I convinced myself it was just stress, maybe some reflux from all the coffee and missed meals.
364. Because I knew you'd react exactly like this, make me slow down, make me take time off, make me actually [laughs bitterly] deal with things instead of just pushing through them like I always have.
365. [voice trembling] After Mom died, the OR was the only place where I felt in control, where I could fix things. [crying while speaking] Every patient I saved felt like somehow balancing the cosmic scales for not being there when she needed me.
366. [quietly] I'm scared that if I slow down, if I stop for even a minute, everything I've been avoiding will catch up to me. [exhales slowly] And now it has anyway, hasn't it?
367. [hesitantly] I understand why you're here, Mrs. Chen, and I know this must seem incredibly callous from your perspective, but art has always captured moments of human tragedy.
368. [defensively] The piece is called 'Final Flight' and it's meant to honor the fragility of life, not exploit it. [pause] The proceeds are going partially to mental health charities.
369. Seventy percent goes to charity, yes. The rest covers platform fees and my time creating the piece, which took weeks of digital layering and conceptual development.
370. [empathetically] I never intended for it to become viral in that way, and I'm genuinely sorry your daughter had to experience that. [sighs] The internet can be cruel with how it handles sensitive content.
371. [quickly] The timing was about capturing a cultural moment when people were discussing mental health and suicide prevention, not about capitalizing on fresh grief. [clearing throat] I've created similar pieces about other tragedies.
372. [firmly] Look, I understand you're grieving, but documentary photographers have been doing this for decades, from war zones to natural disasters, and NFTs are simply the modern evolution of that tradition.
373. [regretful] You're right about the consent issue, and that's something I've been grappling with since I started this series about public tragedies and their digital footprints.
374. [softly] I'll pull it from the marketplace immediately, no questions asked, and I'll transfer the current bid amount directly to your family or a charity of your choice. [long pause]
375. [very sincerely] There's no catch. Seeing you here, hearing about your daughter, it's different from the abstract idea of tragedy as artistic subject matter. [quietly] The NFT sold yesterday for forty thousand dollars. [sighs]
376. [apologetic] I can burn the NFT, essentially destroy it on the blockchain, but I'd need the buyer's consent first. [very quietly] They're a collector from Singapore who specializes in controversial digital art, but I might be able to convince them.
377. [anxiously] I know the timing is impossible, but my dad's in the ICU and the dedication page says things I can't—[voice breaking] things I wrote when I was angry and stupid.
378. [shaky voice] Just this one paragraph.
379. [quietly] The dedication calls him absent, says the music filled the silence he left behind. [exhales] But he's been trying to reconnect for three years and I kept pushing him away.
380. [surprised] You'd do that?
381. [relieved] I don't even know your name, but you're literally saving me from a mistake I'd regret forever. [pause] The new text is on my phone, I can email it right now.
382. [grateful] Coffee's the least I can do. [sighs] My whole band thinks I'm too stubborn about my dad, but standing here watching you stop everything to help a stranger—maybe they're right.
383. [hesitantly] Would it be weird if I stayed and helped? [pause] I know nothing about printing, but I can stack papers or clean or just keep you company through the night shift.
384. [emotional] After tomorrow's concert, I'm going straight to the hospital. [voice trembling] Maybe I'll bring him one of these programs, show him the new dedication.
385. [softly] Jazz, like my dad used to play before I was born. [chuckles] I spent so many years trying to be different from him, and ended up following his exact path anyway.
386. [very sincerely] Marcus, I'll remember this night forever—not just because you saved the programs, but because you reminded me that strangers can be kind when it matters most. [pause] Thank you.
387. Jesus Christ, what the hell are you—wait, you're the thing that's been moving my gear around? [shaky voice] I thought I was going crazy finding the amps in different positions every morning.
388. [confused] You're telling me you eat sound? [pause] And you specifically need my vintage amps running all night to survive?
389. [frustrated] Do you have any idea how much those electricity bills have been costing the venue? [exhales] My boss has been threatening to fire me for weeks because of the overnight power usage.
390. [bitter] So what, you're just going to find another venue to haunt? [quietly] Leave me to explain why the power bills suddenly drop after months of mysterious spikes?
391. [firmly] Stop. Just stop.
392. [curious] You're saying Thompson's been stealing? [pause] And you can prove this because you literally live in the ceiling and hear everything?
393. Even if that's true, how do I explain suddenly knowing about it? [sighs] I can't exactly tell people a sound-eating creature from the rafters told me.
394. This is insane, completely insane, but I actually believe you. [exhales] God help me, I'm negotiating with a creature that eats guitar tones.
395. [slowly] I'll run the JCM800 on the clean channel, low volume, overnight. [pause] But you have to help me nail Thompson first, and after that, we figure out a long-term solution.
396. [warmly] Just remember this when you're eavesdropping on my conversations with my ex. [chuckle] And maybe help me figure out which vintage pedals are actually worth the money—you must have quite the ear for tone by now.
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT (continued) ---
397. Absolutely. And I'm also... I'm adding a 10% courtesy credit, reference number CRT-5541-BB, for the hassle. Because waiting a week for something that should have been automatic? That's on us.
398. Exactly. Forty percent total. The original thirty percent refund plus the ten percent apology credit. Both going to your card ending in 4476. And I'm putting a priority flag on your account so if anything goes wrong—which it won't—but if it does, you'll get routed straight to senior support.
399. That's right. Forty percent. Two hours maximum. I'm actually staying on past my shift at 3:00 PM Eastern just to make sure this processes correctly. You shouldn't have to call us a third time about this.
400. Of course! This never should have happened. I mean, you've been incredibly patient about this whole thing. Your order from November 10th, the damage report, waiting for the first call's resolution... I'm just sorry our system failed you.
401. You're so welcome. And I'm giving you my direct extension, 4-5-5-9, just in case. Though honestly? You won't need it. This is getting fixed today. I promise you that.
402. Oh absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me just pull up your account here... okay, I'm seeing your business account ending in 4892. So what's going on with the billing?
403. Oh that's—hmm, that's definitely not right. Let me look into this for you, okay? I can see you have 47 active subscription customers, and... wait, I'm noticing something here. So it looks like there might've been a processing error on December 3rd at 2:47 PM.
404. Ah okay, so that's—actually no wait, let me check something else. I see you switched from processor ID PROC-7829-XK to the new one, PROC-9012-ML, and it looks like, um, both systems might've run charges. But don't worry, we can definitely fix this.
405. So I'm looking at the affected transactions now and... let me see here... it's showing 12 customers total who were charged twice, with amounts ranging from $32.99 to $87.50. I know that sounds scary but honestly, we can reverse all of these today.
406. I promise you it's going to be okay. What I'm doing right now is—er, actually let me explain this properly. I'm initiating batch reversal number BR-20241208-5K3M9, which will credit all 12 accounts within the next 2 to 4 hours.
407. Hmm, good question. So what they'll see is—oh actually, this is better than I thought—with reversal code BR-5K3M9, the duplicate charge will disappear completely from their statement, like it never happened. The original charge from transaction batch TB-3847 stays, but the duplicate vanishes.
408. You're absolutely right, and I'm—yeah, I'm really sorry about this. Our duplicate prevention system, um, it should've flagged this but there was a 6-minute gap in the monitoring between 2:47 and 2:53 PM. Let me make sure this doesn't happen again though, okay?
409. Oh wow, I see that—you're absolutely one of our premium merchants, account tier GOLD-7749. So what I can do is, uh, actually I'm going to add our enhanced monitoring package at no charge, that's normally $49 per month, and it includes real-time duplicate detection.
410. That's a fair point and—mmm, let me pull up your account history. So it looks like this feature launched on November 15th, and... oh interesting, your account manager should've reached out. I'm adding a note here for Marcus Chen, extension 4012, to call you tomorrow about this.
411. Absolutely, yes. So I've activated the enhanced monitoring effective immediately—confirmation code EM-9982-ACTIVE—and all 12 refunds are processing. Plus I'm, er, I'm applying a $250 service credit to your December statement for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
412. Good afternoon, I'd be happy to assist you with your TableSync Pro subscription. Let me pull up your account details right away. May I have your email address or account number?
413. Perfect, I have your account here. I show you're currently on our Premium plan at $89.99 monthly, which renewed on November 12th. What specific billing discrepancy are you seeing?
414. I see the issue now. You enrolled during our October promotion for $69.00 monthly when billed annually, but the system defaulted to our standard month-to-month Premium rate of $89.99.
415. Absolutely, I understand the importance of accurate billing for your business operations. I'm going to immediately switch you to the promotional annual plan at $828.00 per year, which breaks down to $69.00 monthly.
416. Certainly. I'm processing a credit of $20.99 right now for the November overage, and that will appear on your account within 24 to 48 hours as adjustment credit ADJ-77B42K.
417. I've locked in your promotional rate with guarantee code PROM-VR69-2024, which ensures your annual renewal will remain at $828.00 through October 2025. You'll receive an email confirmation within the next fifteen minutes.
418. Yes, absolutely. You retain full Premium access including unlimited reservations, staff scheduling for up to 25 employees, and our advanced analytics dashboard with report export features.
419. Of course.
420. I can update that immediately. Once you provide the new card details, I'll apply it to your account and send a secure confirmation to your email at 3:47 PM Eastern time today.
421. Thank you for your patience and professionalism. I'm ready for the new payment information, and I'll also include a complimentary one-month extension on your annual term for the inconvenience, extending your renewal to November 2025.
422. Let me see here... Account number ending in 7842. Hmm. Payment declined yesterday.
423. Okay so that's—no wait, actually—I'm seeing the card CVX-4921-88 expired. Last month. That explains it.
424. Happens all the time. Let me just—hmm, what if we update the card right now? Takes two minutes.
425. Got the new card ready? I'll—let me switch screens here... Processing system PRO-7621. Ready when you are.
426. Perfect. Expiration date?
427. Validating now... *exhales* Okay good news. Card approved. Reference number REF-9982-VK.
428. All set. Though—er, hold on—membership fee MEM-3847 processes tomorrow. Want to run it now instead?
429. Let me just—processing payment... Transaction ID TXN-5529-QM... Done. Receipt to your email.
430. Mmm, yeah that's rough. System shows—actually wait—discount code GYM-STAFF-25 never applied. Let me fix that.
431. Since... *sharp inhale* ...January. Credit coming. CRD-8821-LP for $127.50. Should see it in 3-5 days.
432. Good afternoon, I appreciate your directness. My name is Sarah and I specialize in commercial accounts with order values over $5000. May I have your account number so I can review your pricing structure?
433. Thank you. I see your account AC-8974-M shows preferred pricing tier 3. Let me pull up the specific part number you're inquiring about and I'll review all recent quotes issued.
434. I see the discrepancy immediately. The MAG-7742-XL should reflect your contracted rate of $487.50, not the retail price. This appears to be a system classification error where it's categorized as specialty instead of standard inventory.
435. You're absolutely right to be frustrated. Our SKU database underwent migration on October 15th and approximately 2300 commercial parts were incorrectly reclassified. I'm correcting this specific item now and flagging your account for manual review.
436. Let me run a comprehensive audit. I'm seeing 47 items you've ordered in the past 90 days that show pricing inconsistencies. Would you like me to generate a corrected price sheet with all adjustments?
437. Absolutely. I'm calculating credits back to October 15th for all affected purchases. Initial review shows $3,847.62 in overcharges across 18 separate transactions. I'll have this processed today.
438. Certainly. I'm assigning your account to our Technical Parts Division, specifically to extension 4421. They handle accounts requiring component-level expertise and will review all quotes before processing.
439. I've corrected the pricing to $487.50 and can process that immediately for same-day shipping from our Newark warehouse. Would you like me to add that to purchase order PO-9847 that's currently open?
440. Perfect. I've added 2 units of TF-3360-HC at your contracted rate of $24.75 each. Your total is $537.00 and will ship by 3:00 PM Eastern for next-day delivery before noon.
441. Thank you for your patience with this issue. I'm sending the complete audit report, order confirmation, and credit memo to your email on file. You'll also receive my direct line, extension 5578, for any future technical pricing concerns.
442. Good morning, and thank you for calling. I'd be happy to assist you with your payroll inquiry. May I have your employee ID number and the pay period in question?
443. Thank you. I'm pulling up employee record 74296 now. I can see your regular hours for the period ending October 15th, which shows 40 base hours logged. Can you tell me how many overtime hours you worked?
444. I understand. I'm checking your timesheet entries for that period, and I can see the 40 regular hours were processed but no overtime entries appear in our system TR-2024-10-15. Did you submit the overtime through the standard portal or paper forms?
445. Certainly. I'm accessing the submission logs now. I can see a partial submission at 3:47 PM on October 16th that appears to have timed out. The system shows error code E-4521, which indicates the session expired before final confirmation.
446. I'll initiate a payroll adjustment right away. I'm creating adjustment request PAY-ADJ-10298 for 12 overtime hours at your rate of $31.50 per hour, which totals $472.50 before taxes.
447. Given that this was a technical issue on our end, I'm marking this for expedited processing. The adjustment will be included in a special pay run on October 25th, and you'll see it in your account by October 26th.
448. Absolutely. I'm sending confirmation now to your email on file ending in @groundsdept.com. The message will include reference number PAY-ADJ-10298 and all the adjustment details we've discussed.
449. Excellent question. I recommend saving your entries every 10 minutes using the save draft feature. Additionally, our IT team pushed update 3.2.1 last night that extends the timeout window from 15 to 30 minutes.
450. I have everything I need. Your adjustment is confirmed and processing. You'll receive your email confirmation within 5 minutes, and the funds will be deposited by October 26th at 3:00 AM Eastern.
451. You're very welcome. I understand the importance of timely payment. If you don't see the adjustment by October 26th, please call us back with reference number PAY-ADJ-10298. Have a good day and thank you for your patience.
452. Let me pull that up. Account ending in 8-8-9-2. The charge for $47.99?
453. Okay so. That's your CloudSync Pro subscription. Started March fifteenth. Monthly recurring.
454. Hmm, what happened here... The trial converted. Standard process. After fourteen days it rolls to paid. Transaction ID CSP-4738-MMK.
455. Happens all the time. All. The. Time. Let me—no wait—actually. Can process a partial refund. Two months. That's $95.98 back to your card.
456. Done. Refund reference R-2024-6839. Three to five business days. Subscription's canceled now too.
457. You've got seventeen other subscriptions active. Total monthly is $287.43. Want me to list them? Might be more you forgot.
458. Netflix fifteen ninety-nine. Spotify nine ninety-nine. Adobe Creative—that one's hefty—fifty-four ninety-nine. Keep going?
459. Canceling that. Saves you $659.88 yearly. Big one. Confirmation ADO-CANCEL-7824.
460. FitTrack Pro. MealPlanner Plus. Two news subscriptions—WSJ and Times. Game Pass Ultimate. Language app. $73.42 right there.
461. Let me see here... Cancel the rest? That's. Hmm. $203.85 back in your pocket monthly. Process it all now?
462. Hey hey, I totally understand the frustration, you know I actually learned English as my second language too, moved here when I was twelve, so let me let me help you through this step by step, what language do you normally speak?
463. Okay okay perfect, so you're having something that happens monthly, let me pull up your account here with number ACC-9847-BZ and I can see you've called us on the fifteenth of each month for the past three months, is this about the subscription charge of $47.89?
464. Oh interesting, so so the amount changes, I see it now, October was $47.89, September was $51.23, and August was actually $44.67, and honestly this happened to me with my gym membership once, turned out they were adding different fees each month.
465. You're absolutely right right, let me check your original agreement from June, document number DOC-3928-KL says locked rate of $39.99 monthly, so these extra charges ranging from $4.68 to $11.24 definitely shouldn't be there.
466. Exactly exactly, and you know what, I had a similar situation with my internet provider last year and they tried to make it complicated but but we're not doing that here, I'm calculating the total overcharge as $23.81 across those three months.
467. Oh man, yeah I can see that note from agent TM-4429 but they they totally missed the contract terms, I'm actually kind of new here but I spent extra time in training on billing issues because my trainer said this happens a lot with international accounts.
468. So here's the thing, and I'm being real with you because my family dealt with this too when we first immigrated, sometimes companies try that but your contract CON-8827-PT explicitly states same terms regardless of billing region, no exceptions.
469. Listen I'm I'm gonna make this right, already processed your refund of $23.81 with confirmation code REF-9982-XM, and I'm adding a note in Portuguese to your account so next time anyone can see exactly what your contract terms are.
470. Well my Portuguese is is pretty basic but I know enough to write "taxa fixa mensal $39.99 sem taxas adicionais" which basically means fixed monthly rate no additional fees, and that way there's no confusion next time.
471. Hey that means a lot, honestly when I started here two weeks ago I promised myself I'd I'd be the kind of support person I wished I had when I was struggling with language stuff, your new reference number is CASE-7764-BR and call me directly at extension 4492 if this happens again.
472. Oh absolutely. Let me. Pull that up. Account number? Actually wait. Phone number works too. Whatever's easiest for you right now.
473. Got it. 555-0147. Okay so. Hmm, let me see here. November fifteenth. There's a note. REQ-2847-B. Says billing adjustment request. Twenty-seven fifty overcharge. Is that. Is that what you called about?
474. No no. There's more. Let me—okay so that means. It says here. Monthly duplicate charge. Since August. Total refund pending. Ninety-six dollars even. They documented. Everything. The whole timeline.
475. Oh. *exhales* I hear you. I really do. System shows. Um. Previous ticket. TKT-9823-X. September. Never processed. That's. That's not okay. At all.
476. No. Listen. I'm putting. Personal escalation. My badge number. EMP-4429. Direct to billing supervisor. Today. Not tomorrow. Today.
477. Completely sure. Here's what. What I'm doing differently. Sending confirmation. To your email. The one on file. JSmith at gmail. With case number. REQ-2847-B. And my direct line. Extension 3847.
478. Honestly? System doesn't. Require it. Should though. Drives me crazy too. Some reps just. Click submit. Move on. But your money matters. Your time matters.
479. I believe that. I do. But look. Here's the thing. No follow-up scheduled. No escalation flag. Just sitting there. In queue. With eight hundred others.
480. Because. Right now. While we're talking. Setting reminder. My personal calendar. Thursday. Two PM. If billing hasn't processed. I'm walking it. To their desk. Myself.
481. Already set. Phone's buzzing Thursday. REQ-2847-B. Ninety-six dollar refund. For JSmith. 555-0147. Account ending in 7294. It's all. Right here. Not going anywhere.
482. Got it got it okay so I'm looking at account number ACC-4521-BX here and I see a pending charge for $8,750.42 that's set to process tonight at midnight which is... what's the word... substantial for sure.
483. Right so here's what I can tell you the system shows this as a pre-authorized charge from October 28th for order MDL-9982-K and once those are in the queue they process automatically after the hold period expires which is unfortunately not something I can override.
484. Absolutely and I hear you I really do but let me see here... hmm what if... okay so the charge hits in approximately 6 hours but I could potentially split it into two transactions of $4,375.21 each if that would help with your cash flow situation?
485. Okay okay wait wait I'm seeing something interesting here your account has a credit line available of $12,000 that's currently unused so technically the charge could process against that instead of your checking which would give you until November 30th to pay it off interest-free.
486. Well that's the thing I can't stop the charge but what I can do is set up an instant transfer from your credit line for exactly $8,750.42 to cover it and then you'd have that grace period I mentioned plus if you pay within 72 hours there's actually a 2% cashback bonus.
487. That's weird actually because... let me think... okay so normally orders over $5,000 trigger an automatic prompt about financing but your order MDL-9982-K shows it was placed through our contractor portal which might've bypassed that whole...
488. Right right I get that and honestly our system is kind of... it's built more for retail than contractors which is why we have these workarounds but listen I can also add a note here with priority flag PRY-7734 for our commercial team to contact you about our new flex-pay program.
489. Perfect yes okay so I'm initiating transfer TRN-8845-QZ right now for the full $8,750.42 and you'll get a confirmation text in about thirty seconds with all the details about the November 30th deadline.
490. Nope.
491. Okay so you're all set the transfer is processing and just so you know for future orders if you use code FLEX30 at checkout it automatically sets up that 30-day payment delay without having to call in or do this whole credit line dance.
492. Good morning. I understand the urgency of this situation and I'm here to help you secure your account immediately. Let me pull up our security protocols while you provide me your account number or registered email address.
493. Thank you. I've located your account under customer ID CUS-847291-SI and I can see unusual activity logged at 3:47 AM Eastern time. I'm initiating our security lockdown protocol right now to prevent any further unauthorized access.
494. I'm reviewing the security log now. The intrusion affected your billing preferences and attempted to add three unauthorized users with IDs USR-9847X, USR-9848X, and USR-9849X. However, our fraud detection system blocked the payment method changes before they could process.
495. Certainly. First, I'm generating a temporary security token TSK-20241115-8847 that will expire in 30 minutes. You'll use this to reset your master credentials through our secure portal at secure.company.com/recovery.
496. Yes, please do. Once you're there, enter the token I provided and you'll see verification code VRF-6829-STER appear on your screen. Read that back to me to confirm you're in the correct secure environment.
497. Perfect. You're in the right place. Create your new password following our enhanced security requirements, and once that's complete, I'll enable two-factor authentication using protocol 2FA-ENTERPRISE-7749 for maximum protection going forward.
498. Of course. I've activated enterprise-grade two-factor authentication on your account. You'll receive a confirmation at your registered email with setup instructions and your authentication app pairing code APP-STERLING-4471-2FA.
499. I've permanently removed all three unauthorized users and their associated permissions. Additionally, I've generated a complete audit report under reference number AUD-20241115-0931 that details every action taken during the breach.
500. Absolutely. I'll send the audit report to compliance@sterling-industries.com within the next ten minutes. I've also assigned your case to our security specialist team under priority ticket PST-8847-CRITICAL for ongoing monitoring over the next 72 hours.
501. Yes, you'll receive a comprehensive security assessment report on November 18th with case closure reference CLO-8847-2024. Our specialist team will also contact you directly if they detect any suspicious activity during the monitoring period.
502. I understand your concern and I'll help you resolve this immediately. May I have the gift card number located on the back of the card, starting with GC?
503. Thank you. I'm pulling up gift card GC-4829-7361-9042 in our system now. I can see it was activated on October 12th with a fifty dollar balance as you mentioned.
504. I see what happened here. There was a transaction on October 14th at 3:47 PM Eastern for exactly fifty dollars at one of our online checkout systems.
505. I understand completely. Let me check the transaction details including the order number ORD-9847-ZM and the IP address 192.168.45.227 that was used for this purchase.
506. That's a possibility I'm investigating. The transaction shows delivery to an address in ZIP code 44107, which is Cleveland, Ohio. Does this location sound familiar to you?
507. Thank you for confirming. I'm immediately flagging this transaction as unauthorized and initiating case number FRD-2024-10-8847 for our fraud prevention team to investigate further.
508. Absolutely. I'm processing a full refund right now and issuing you a replacement gift card with number GC-4829-7361-9043, which will have the full fifty dollar value restored.
509. Of course. The new gift card will be active within the next two hours, and you'll receive an email confirmation to the address on file ending in @gmail.com with all the details.
510. Yes, please destroy the physical card. I've already deactivated gift card GC-4829-7361-9042 in our system at 10:34 AM today, so it cannot be used again.
511. Everything is handled on our end. Your case FRD-2024-10-8847 will be reviewed by our security team, and if we need additional information, we'll contact you at the phone number ending in 7723.
512. I sincerely apologize for that disruption to your household. Let me document this concern and see how we can address this immediately for you and other customers experiencing similar issues.
513. That's completely unacceptable, and I understand your frustration. I'm pulling up our audio system settings now, and I can see our hold music is currently set to level 8 out of 10, which is definitely too high.
514. You're absolutely right to question that. According to our system logs from October 23rd, there was a technical update that inadvertently reset our audio defaults to factory settings, which are unnecessarily high.
515. Unfortunately yes, since that date. I can see we've received 47 similar complaints in the past two weeks alone, and I'm escalating this to our technical team with priority code P1-AUDIO-112.
516. Certainly. I'm implementing two immediate solutions: first, I'm adding your number to our callback list so you won't need to wait on hold, and second, our team will reduce the volume to level 3 by 5 PM today.
517. Our callback window is within 2 hours during business hours, and you'll receive a text confirmation with reference number CB-2024-8847 showing your position in the queue.
518. Absolutely. The adjustment will apply across all 24 of our customer service lines, and we're also implementing a new protocol requiring management approval for any audio level changes above level 4.
519. Of course. I'm documenting that feedback in ticket number TK-45782-AUD, and I see similar comments about our current classical playlist being too dramatic for a waiting environment.
520. I completely agree. Our customer experience team is actually reviewing alternatives, and we have a shortlist of 5 ambient music providers that specialize in healthcare and family-friendly environments.
521. The volume reduction happens today by 5 PM as mentioned, and the music selection change is scheduled for November 15th. You'll receive an email confirmation at the address on file within the next 30 minutes detailing all these improvements.
522. Oh no no no, you're not being dumb at all, let me—actually wait—let me pull up your account real quick here, what's your order number if you have it handy?
523. Okay perfect so I'm looking at ORD-4492-BK here and yeah it says delivered yesterday at 2:47 PM to your front door at 1823 Maple Street, but you're saying—hmm—you never actually received it, is that right?
524. Got it got it.
525. No listen you're absolutely not missing anything obvious, this happens more than you'd think actually, so what I need to do is—well first—did you check with neighbors by any chance, sometimes drivers accidentally deliver to the wrong address?
526. Hey hey no need to apologize at all, seriously this is exactly what we're here for, so basically I'm gonna file what we call a DNR report—that's "did not receive"—with tracking number TRK-8827-QM94 and that starts an investigation with the carrier right away.
527. Right right so here's how this works, and I know it's frustrating but bear with me here, the carrier has 48 hours to investigate which means they'll GPS track where the driver scanned it, check if maybe it got misdelivered to unit B instead of A or something like that.
528. I know I know.
529. Ohh man okay so you need it for tomorrow, that definitely changes things, let me—hmm actually—here's what I can do, I'm putting in an override code OVR-7753 to immediately ship you a replacement via overnight delivery today before 3 PM cutoff.
530. Absolutely yes yes, so the replacement will have tracking number TRK-9901-LX55 and you'll get that by 10 AM tomorrow guaranteed, and then if the original shows up, which sometimes happens, you just keep both, consider it an apology from us.
531. Hey no worries at all, I totally get it, these things are stressful especially when you're on a deadline, so you'll get an email confirmation in about five minutes with that new tracking number TRK-9901-LX55 and everything should be good to go for tomorrow!
532. Oh gosh—I'm really sorry you've been through that. Let me pull up your account... okay got it, account ID ACC-7749-KL. Tell me everything—I'm here to actually fix this.
533. Absolutely! Look—no wait—here's what we'll do. I've got your case number CSE-89234-P right here, and hmm, I can see the previous notes but I want to hear it from you directly.
534. They LOST—okay hang on. Whoa. Let me check the tracking... TRK-6628-QM shows it arriving at our facility November 3rd but then—er, this is weird—nothing after that.
535. Right right. That's—ugh, that's not okay. Alright so—actually wait—I'm escalating this to our resolution team right now, ticket ESC-7792-X, because losing a $1,849 device is completely unacceptable.
536. Yes! And—okay between you and me? I'm marking this priority code PRI-5, which basically means it jumps ahead of everything else, should hear back within 24 hours max.
537. I completely get it. Look—no actually—here's my direct extension, 4782. If you don't hear back by tomorrow 3pm, you call me directly and I'll personally track this down.
538. Yeah well—this shouldn't have happened. Your case reference is REF-9923-JK7, and frankly? I'm putting a note that if we can't locate it within 48 hours, we process a full replacement at no charge.
539. So next steps—the escalation team will call you within 24 hours from number 800-555-7823. They'll either have located your laptop or—honestly—they'll start the replacement process immediately.
540. Then you call me. Extension 4782. I mean it—I've set a reminder for myself for tomorrow 4pm to check your case personally if I haven't heard resolution confirmation.
541. Hey—of course! That's what we're here for. You've got case REF-9923-JK7, my extension 4782, and honestly? I'm gonna check on this myself tomorrow morning too, just to make sure it's moving.
542. Oh wow, five times—that's that's a lot. Let me pull up your account real quick... what's your—sorry, can I get your account number?
543. No worries, we can use your email instead. Actually wait—let me try... what's the word... alternate lookup. Phone number works too, ends in what digits?
544. Got it, ends in 4827... okay okay I see you here. Account ID M2847-KILO. Huh, that's interesting—you've got priority status flagged. Military family program, right?
545. Yeah no I—I totally get that. So your current address shows Fort Campbell, Kentucky, ZIP 42223. Where're we updating to this time?
546. Fort Lewis... that's that's Joint Base Lewis-McChord now, right? ZIP should be... hmm... 98433? Let me verify—sorry, gotta make sure I get this right.
547. My brother's stationed there actually. Okay so—wait, that's weird. System's showing you have three pending orders to the Kentucky address. Orders ORD-7792-ALPHA, ORD-8134-BRAVO, and uh... ORD-8256-CHARLIE.
548. No no wait—lemme check the... what's it called... fulfillment status. Two shipped yesterday, tracking TRK-99847-KY and TRK-99848-KY. Third one's processing, should ship by November 15th.
549. Actually I can—hold on hold on, I'm gonna try something. There's a forwarding intercept for military families. Service code MIL-FORWARD-2024. Let me see if I can apply it retroactively.
550. Got it! All three orders now show redirect to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, building 2027. Should add maybe two—no wait, three days. Arrival by November 20th latest.
551. Hey, military families deal with enough, right? Also updated your default address permanently. Reference number REF-LEWIS-8847-WASH for your records. Anything else gets ordered, it'll go straight to Washington.
552. Oh! Yes! Hello there! So. You made it through. The dreaded menu system. I'm guessing that was. Not fun. Let me pull up your account—what's your phone number?
553. Got it. Pulling up account 555-0847 now and. Oh wow. I see the call history. You've been transferred. Four times? In the last hour? That's. That's not okay.
554. Okay so. Here's what happened. Our system update on January 28th. It created this. Glitch. Where option 3 loops back to the main menu instead of transferring to billing like it should.
555. Right right. So basically. I'm adding note BUG-4521-XK to your account. And um. Here's the direct number. Ready? It's 800-555-0199 extension 4412. That bypasses. Everything.
556. Oh! And. Even better. I'm crediting your account $25.00 for the inconvenience. Should post within. Like. Two business days. Reference number CRD-8829-MN41.
557. Absolutely! So. The billing issue you needed help with. I can handle that right now. Save you the transfer. What's going on?
558. Perfect. Easy. Current statement date is the 15th. What day works better? I can set it. Anywhere. Between the 1st and 28th.
559. Done! Effective February 1st. New cycle. Confirmation code SCC-7739-BB22. You'll get an email within. Um. About thirty minutes confirming the change.
560. Oh that's! That's so nice! And hey. Pro tip. Save that direct number 800-555-0199 extension 4412. Works for. Basically. Any department. Just tell them where you need to go.
561. So glad I could help! Your updated billing cycle starts February 1st. Credit posts in two days. And. You've got the secret number. We're. We're good here!
562. Good afternoon, and thank you for calling. I'll be happy to help you resolve this payroll issue. May I please have your employee ID number and the pay period you're referring to?
563. Thank you. I'm pulling up employee ID 3742 now, and I can see your payroll records for the period ending October 20th. According to our system, you were credited with 42.5 regular hours and 6.0 overtime hours. Can you tell me what discrepancy you're seeing?
564. I understand your concern. Let me review the detailed timeclock entries for that week. I'm showing entries from October 14th through October 20th, with a total of 48.5 hours recorded in our TMS-7000 system. Would you like me to go through each day's entries with you?
565. Certainly. Starting with Monday, October 14th, I show 8.5 hours logged from 6:00 AM to 2:30 PM. Tuesday shows 8.0 hours, Wednesday 8.5 hours, Thursday 8.0 hours, and Friday 8.5 hours. Saturday shows 7.0 hours from 7:00 AM to 2:00 PM. Does this match your records?
566. Thank you for clarifying that. I see the issue now. The system shows you clocked out at 2:00 PM on Saturday, October 19th, but you're indicating you worked until 6:00 PM. That would be a 4-hour difference, bringing your total to 52.5 hours for the week. Is that correct?
567. That's very helpful information. Since you have documentation with your supervisor's signature, we can definitely process a payroll adjustment. I'll create adjustment case PAY-20241028-3742 for you right now. Can you provide your supervisor's name for verification?
568. Perfect. I've noted that Maria Rodriguez authorized the additional hours on October 19th. The adjustment for 4.0 additional hours at time-and-a-half rate comes to $92.40 gross pay. This will be processed in correction batch CB-1147 and included in your next regular paycheck.
569. I completely understand the urgency. Since today is October 28th, and your next regular pay date is November 1st, the correction will be included then. However, given your situation, I can flag this as priority case P1-URG for an off-cycle payment by October 31st if that would help.
570. Of course. I've updated your case to priority status with approval code APV-8827-MR. You'll receive the off-cycle payment of $92.40 gross, which after standard deductions will be approximately $71.50 net, by direct deposit on October 31st. You should also receive an email confirmation within the next hour.
571. You're all set. Please keep your signed timesheet for your records, but no further action is needed from you. Your case number PAY-20241028-3742 is fully documented, and I've added detailed notes about the Saturday overtime issue. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your payroll today?
572. Oh okay, um, I can definitely help you sort this out. Let me just pull up your employee profile here and—actually wait, can I get your employee ID first? Er, should be on your badge, starts with EMP.
573. Got it, EMP-7739... hmm, okay so I'm seeing—oh wait, this is interesting. Your tip reporting for the week ending October 28th shows $187.42 but the actual distributed amount is, uh—let me recalculate—it's showing $142.18. That's definitely not right.
574. No no, we're fixing this right now. So basically what happened is—er, hold on, I'm checking the distribution logs—looks like table 14B on October 26th had a tip adjustment after close, and um, the system didn't properly allocate your percentage. I'm escalating this to payroll immediately.
575. Actually I can—no wait, let me try something else. Okay so, I'm putting through an emergency adjustment code ADJ-2847-TIP right now, and uh, the missing $45.24 will hit your account within 24 hours. But here's what I'm gonna do to make sure this doesn't happen again...
576. I know, I know, it's frustrating. Look, um, what I'm also doing is—I'm flagging your profile with code PROT-VERIFY so any future tip distributions get, er, basically double-checked before processing. And actually, let me add my direct extension 4021 to your file.
577. Yes! So your case number is CASE-9901-ADJ, and uh, I'm also sending you an email right now to—hmm, wait, I don't have an email on file. Can I get that from you real quick?
578. Jmartin at gmail, perfect. So I'm sending—actually no, let me also include, um... I'm attaching the full breakdown showing exactly where that $45.24 went missing, and er, I'm CC'ing our payroll supervisor directly.
579. No, absolutely not. Like, I'm putting a permanent watch on your account—code WATCH-TIP-01—so basically any tip distribution over $100 gets manually reviewed. And um, between you and me? I'm gonna check your next three pay periods myself.
580. Actually, er, here's what I'm thinking—I can set up automatic alerts to your phone. So like, every time tips get distributed, you'd get a text with the exact amount from number 77429, and if something looks wrong, you text back STOP and it, uh, freezes everything for review.
581. Hey, I get it, this shouldn't be your problem. But um, until we get the whole system updated in January—they're rolling out version 3.2.1—this keeps you protected. And seriously, if anything looks weird, even like a dollar off, you call extension 4021 directly. That's me. We'll fix it immediately.
582. Good afternoon, and thank you for calling. I'll be happy to help you resolve this charge issue. May I have your account number so I can pull up the details?
583. Thank you. I have your account here, number 4729-PAINT-PRO, showing a purchase on October 28th for $247.85. I can see you initiated a return on November 2nd for three gallons of WeatherGuard primer.
584. I see the issue now. The return was logged under transaction RET-11022024-8834 but appears to be pending in our system. Let me expedite this credit for you immediately.
585. I completely understand the urgency. I'm processing your credit of $89.97 right now, and it will post to your account within the next two hours, well before end of business today.
586. Absolutely. You'll receive an email confirmation to your registered address within 15 minutes showing credit memo CM-2024-11-457. The full amount will be available for your purchases immediately after processing.
587. Certainly. Your contractor discount of 15% is active and valid through December 31st, 2025. Your account shows excellent standing with 47 transactions this year.
588. Let me check our inventory system. The Riverside location currently has 22 five-gallon buckets of neutral base in stock, SKU number NB-5GAL-2024. Would you like me to reserve some for tomorrow?
589. I've reserved six buckets under reservation number RSV-11082024-PAINT. They'll be held at the contractor desk for 48 hours, and your discount will automatically apply at checkout.
590. I'm glad we could resolve everything efficiently today. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your account or upcoming orders?
591. You're very welcome. Thank you for your continued business, and best of luck with your commercial project on Monday. Have a great rest of your day.
# --- MONOLOGUE (continued) ---
592. I got the keys yesterday. [emotional] Can you believe that? After everything, I actually have keys to my own place. [pause] You know, for three years you gave me that lunch every single day. Even when it was raining, even when I could tell you were rushing to get somewhere. [warmly] And you never made me feel small about it. That's the thing that, um... that's what really mattered. Most people, they'd hand stuff over like they were doing charity work, you know? But you'd always ask about my day. [chuckle] Remember when I told you about that pigeon that kept stealing my crackers? [very sincerely] You brought extra crackers the next day just for the bird. [sniffle] Look, I know a sandwich doesn't seem like much to most people, but when you're out there and everyone walks past you like you're invisible— [shaky voice] having someone see you every day, that keeps you human. It keeps you believing you're still worth something. [pause] The apartment's small, just a studio, but it's mine. There's a little kitchen and everything. [excited] I'm gonna learn to cook! Real meals, not just— well, you know. [hesitantly] I was thinking, um... maybe sometime you'd let me make you lunch? [hopeful] Just to return the favor, even though I could never really repay what you did.
593. Sarah just called me and I can't—I literally can't stop shaking. [very excited] She used the safety planning protocol we went over last month! The one where we talked about, um, identifying those escalation patterns? [emotional] That woman is alive because Sarah knew what to look for. [pause] God, when she said the husband had started isolating her from family, changing passwords, that thing about, uh... about tracking her phone location—Sarah remembered every single red flag we discussed. [very sincerely] And the way she handled it was so perfect, you know? She didn't push, didn't judge, just... just quietly gave her the hotline number hidden in that receipt trick I showed everyone. [shaky voice] The woman called from a gas station bathroom three hours later. Three hours. [pause] [relieved] She's safe now, she's actually safe. I keep thinking about, hmm, what if Sarah hadn't been paying attention during training? What if I'd rushed through that section because we were running late? [emotional] But we didn't rush it. We covered everything. [pause] [warm] This is why we do this work, right? Not for the certificates or the, er, the mandatory compliance stuff—for this exact moment when someone needs us to know what we're doing. [very quietly] Someone's kids still have their mom tonight because of what we taught Sarah. [sniffle] Sorry, I just... I needed to tell someone who gets it.
594. Three weeks since the hurricane and I'm still finding debris in the soil beds. [exhausted] God, I never thought I'd be doing this. I mean, before all this I was just... growing tomatoes for the farmers market, you know? [short pause] But now it's like—everyone's counting on me. Mrs. Rodriguez came by yesterday with her grandkids and, um, they haven't had fresh vegetables in weeks. [very sincerely] The look on their faces when I gave them those peppers... 
595. The key finally arrived yesterday. [exhausted] God, I walked in and just... I couldn't even get through the hallway. [short pause] Fifty years of newspapers, Mom's sewing magazines, those QVC boxes she never opened—they're literally stacked to the ceiling. [frustrated] And the smell is, um... it's not great. [sigh] I found her reading chair though, buried under all these coats. [very sad] She used to read me stories there when I was little. [pause] The contractor said it'll take, like, three dumpsters minimum just for the first floor. [angry] Three! And that's not even counting whatever's in the basement. [groan] I don't know, part of me wants to just... hire someone else to do it. But then, hmm, what if there's important stuff? [anxious] Like, what if I throw away photo albums or her jewelry or—oh God, what if there's money hidden somewhere? [very quickly] She always said she didn't trust banks after the Depression. [hesitantly] I guess I have to go through everything myself. [sniffle] Found her apron today, the one with the strawberries. [crying while speaking] She wore it every Sunday making her pound cake. [long pause] [relieved] Maybe... maybe this is how I get to say goodbye properly, you know? [warm] One box at a time.
596. [bitter] Sarah's one year sober today. One whole year. And I should be—I am happy for her, I really am. She posted all these photos from her celebration dinner at that fancy place downtown, the one with the tasting menu. [pause] Meanwhile, I'm sitting here trying to figure out if we can keep the lights on next month. [sigh] God, I sound like such a terrible person. She deserves this. She worked so hard, and Mark's been so supportive through everything. [quietly] It's just the timing that's, um... that's killing me. Like, we had to tell the kids no presents for their birthdays this year. No presents. [shaky voice] And there's Sarah with her spa weekend gift certificate and her new meditation retreat planned. [pause] I want to be the sister-in-law who shows up with flowers and takes her to lunch. I want to be that person. [very sad] But I'm over here googling food banks instead. [sniffle] And the worst part is, I can't even tell her why I couldn't come to the party. Because what am I supposed to say? "Sorry, we couldn't afford the gas to drive there?" [exhausted] She thinks I don't care. But I do. I just... I'm drowning in my own stuff right now.
597. They came to me again today. [exhausted] Three different groups, all wanting opposite things. [frustrated] The merchants want lower taxes, the guards want better pay, and the farmers—God, the farmers need new irrigation but where's the gold supposed to come from? [groan] Everyone thinks being regent means I can just wave my hand and fix everything. [bitter] Like I'm some kind of miracle worker instead of just... someone trying to hold this mess together. [pause] The worst part is when they get personal about it. [angry] "Your father would have handled this better," they say. [mocking] As if my father didn't leave me this disaster in the first place! [sigh] But then I remember why I wanted this position. [slowly] Not for the power, not really. [very sincerely] It was because I actually thought I could help. [hesitantly] And sometimes—sometimes I do make a difference. [warm] Like when we finally got clean water to the lower district last month. [smiling speaking] The look on those kids' faces... [trailing off] [clearing throat] That's what keeps me going, I guess. [confidently] Tomorrow I'll face another line of complaints, but maybe, um... maybe I'll actually solve one or two. [relieved] That has to be enough.
598. [exhausted] God, it's finally over. [sigh] Three years of depositions and motions and... and watching Sarah's face get harder every time we passed in the hallway. [bitter] She wouldn't even look at me today when they read the verdict. Just stared straight ahead like I was— like I was nobody. [pause] [quietly] My client deserved that settlement though. He lost his ability to walk because her company cut corners. That's not— that's not something you can just apologize away. [defensive] I did my job, right? That's what lawyers do. We advocate. We fight. [shaky voice] But twenty years of friendship just... gone. [sniffle] All those weekends at her lake house, her kids calling me Aunt Jamie, and now— now I'm just the person who cost her company two million dollars. [regretful] Maybe I should have recused myself when I realized it was her company. But my client needed me, and I was the best person for this case. [very sad] She texted me after. Just said "I understand why you did it, but we're done." [pause] [resigned] Fair enough, I guess. Some things you can't come back from. [very quietly] Doesn't make it hurt any less though.
599. [warm] You know what's funny? I keep catching myself doing the exact same things I used to do with my scout troop. [chuckle] Like yesterday, Sarah was freaking out about that presentation, and I just... automatically went into that whole "break it down into smaller tasks" thing. [thoughtfully] The same way I'd teach kids how to, um, set up camp for the first time. [pause] And she looked at me like I'd just solved world hunger or something. [short pause]
600. I keep meaning to write you this email, but I never know how to start. [nervous] Because how do you tell someone they basically saved your life? [pause] I was seventeen in your English class and, um... I was ready to drop out. [very quietly] My dad had just left, my mom was working three jobs, and I thought—well, I thought school was pointless. [bitter] Then you assigned that essay about our biggest fear. [chuckle] Remember? [warm] And I wrote about being invisible, about feeling like I'd never matter to anyone. [sad] You kept me after class and... [sniffle] God, you said something I'll never forget. [emotional] You said "Your voice deserves to be heard, but first you have to believe it yourself." [pause] That sounds so simple now, but back then? [laugh] It was like—woah—someone actually saw me. [very sincerely] You made me apply to college when I thought community college was, er, out of reach even. [excited] And now I'm a published writer! [extremely happy] Three books! [laugh loudly] Sometimes I'm at readings and I think... she has no idea. [warm] You probably don't even remember that conversation, but it changed everything. [crying while speaking] I almost gave up on myself, and you wouldn't let me. [very sincerely] So, um... thank you. [whisper] Thank you for believing I had something worth saying.
601. They actually tried it. [shocked] I can't believe they actually— [relieved] Oh my God, the honeypot worked. [laugh] Everything we set up, the whole defense in depth strategy that everyone said was overkill? [vindicated] It caught them at layer three. Three! [excited] They didn't even get close to the actual database. [chuckle] 
602. [shaky voice] They actually passed it. The vote was 287 to 146. I keep reading the numbers over and over because I can't— [pause] Twenty-three years. Twenty-three years of fighting for this. [crying while speaking] All those families who wrote to me, who shared their stories, who showed up at every single hearing even when it seemed hopeless. [sniffle] God, there were so many times I almost gave up. [laugh] Remember when Senator Morrison said we were wasting everyone's time? That this would never, ever happen? [very quietly] I actually believed him for a while. Almost quit the whole thing in 2019. But then I'd think about, um... I'd think about the Johnsons, and Maria's daughter, and all those kids who needed this. [relieved] Seven million people. That's how many people this affects. Seven million. [extremely happy] Their medical bills, their treatments, their entire lives are about to change! [pause] I should call Mom. She never stopped believing this would happen. Even when I didn't believe it myself. [warm] "You don't give up on what's right," she always said. [sigh] We did it, Mom. We actually did it.
603. [exhausted] Another text from Michael. Let me guess—he needs money again. [pause] Three hundred dollars this time for... car repairs. Right. That's the third time this year, and it's only May. [bitter] I just, hmm, I don't know how to keep doing this. The electric bill is already overdue, and my prescription costs went up again last month. I'm seventy-two years old, for God's sake. [sad] When does it stop being my responsibility to bail him out? [sigh] But then I think about how he's struggling, and I feel like, um... like what kind of mother doesn't help her own son? [frustrated] Except he's forty-three! He should have his life together by now. I mean, I was raising three kids at his age, and nobody was sending me money. [very quietly] I've got maybe eight thousand left in savings. That's it. That's all that's standing between me and... I don't even want to think about it. [shaky voice] And he doesn't know that. He thinks because I own this house outright that I'm, er, somehow rich or something. [pause] Maybe I should just tell him the truth. That his mother is choosing between groceries and keeping the lights on. [very sad] God, how did we end up here?
604. [bitter] God, I can't believe I'm actually saying this to you. [pause] You know what? Since I'm moving to Seattle next week and we'll probably never see each other again, I might as well just— [exhale] I've been jealous of you. [quickly] There, I said it. Happy now? Every promotion you got, every perfect Instagram post, that stupid award you won last year— [frustrated] I hated all of it. I mean, I'd smile and congratulate you, but inside I was just... [trailing off] 
605. [warm] Everyone told me I was crazy, you know? [chuckle] "Why would you adopt a nine-year-old dog?" they said. "You'll just get attached and then—" [pause] But the second I saw Rosie at that shelter, with her gray muzzle and these tired eyes that had seen so much... [very sincerely] I just knew she was mine. [smiling speaking] The shelter said she'd been there for eight months because nobody wants the old ones. [upset] Eight months! Can you imagine? [sigh] The first week, she wouldn't even leave her bed. Just watched me from across the room like she was, um... like she was waiting for me to send her back. [very quietly] It broke my heart. [animated] But then one morning, I woke up and she was there, right next to my bed! [laugh] Not on it, just sitting there, watching me sleep. [passionately] And from that day forward, we were inseparable. Three years we had together. [very melancholic] Three perfect years where she taught me more about love and loyalty than any human ever has. [pause] When she passed last month, I thought I'd, uh... I thought I'd never recover. [relieved] But now I realize she gave me something I'll carry forever. [very sincerely] She showed me that sometimes the best things in life are the ones other people overlook.
606. [very quietly] I forgive you. [pause] There, I said it. After everything you— [shaky voice] after what you did to me, to us, to everyone who loved you. I forgive you. [sigh] And it's weird because I thought saying it would feel like, um... like some big weight lifting off my chest, you know? [confused] But it's more like I've been carrying this heavy box for years and years, and now that I've finally put it down, I don't know what to do with my hands. [laugh] That's stupid. [very sad] God, I spent so long hating you. Like, actively hating you every single day. [bitter] It was my first thought when I woke up and my last thought before bed. And now it's just... gone? [hesitantly] I keep reaching for it, for that anger, and there's nothing there. [cry] Which should feel good, right? [sniffle] I'm free. I'm finally, finally free from you. [very melancholic] But I'm also, I don't know, kind of... empty? Like I carved out this whole part of myself to make room for hating you, and now there's just this, uh, this hollow space. [exhausted] Maybe that's what forgiveness really is. Not peace, just... absence. [long pause] I hope wherever you are, you've forgiven yourself too. [whispering] Because I can't do that part for you.
607. [bitter] So I guess since I'm leaving for Singapore tomorrow and we're never gonna see each other again, I might as well just... say it. [pause] God, this is harder than I thought. Um. Okay. [hesitantly] The truth is, I've been jealous of you. Like, really jealous. For years actually. [laugh] There, I said it. Your promotion, your perfect relationship, that stupid award you won—I hated all of it. Well, no, I didn't hate it, I just... [trailing off] I wanted it to be me, you know? [quietly] And the worst part is, you made it look so easy. Like everything just, mmm, fell into your lap while I was killing myself trying to keep up. [sigh] I know that's not fair, I know you worked hard, but... ugh, it felt like you were always one step ahead. [sad] And instead of being happy for you, I just got more and more bitter. Started making those little comments, being kind of... passive-aggressive. [regretful] I'm sorry. I really am. It's just—I don't know, maybe if I'd been honest from the beginning, we could've been actual friends instead of whatever this was. [very melancholic] Anyway, doesn't matter now, right? I'm gone tomorrow.
608. [warm] You know what's crazy? When Sarah got that promotion last year, I was so genuinely happy for her. Like, I remember calling her and just screaming into the phone with excitement. [laugh] I wasn't thinking about myself at all, I was just... thrilled, you know? For her. [pause] And then two months later, she calls me out of nowhere and says her company is looking for someone with my exact background. [very excited] She literally went to her boss and said "I know the perfect person for this." Can you believe that? [empathetically] She told me later that my reaction to her success—like, how I celebrated with her instead of being weird or jealous about it—that's what made her think of me. [slowly] It's wild how that works, isn't it? When you're genuinely rooting for people, they, um... they want to lift you up too. [happy] Now we're both at the same company, doing work we love, and it all started because I was just being a good friend. [chuckle] My career completely transformed because I was too busy being happy for her to think about what I wasn't getting. [very sincerely] Sometimes the best opportunities come when you're not even looking for them, when you're just... celebrating someone else's win.
609. [warm] You know, I've been doing this job for twelve years now, stamping passports, reviewing documents, saying yes, saying no. But today—today was different. [pause] The Nguyen family case. Five years they've been trying. Five years of applications, appeals, waiting. And when I finally got to tell them yes, when I said those words "Your visa has been approved"—the mother just... [emotional] she collapsed right there in front of my desk. [laugh quietly] Not from sadness, from relief. From joy. Her kids haven't seen their father in five years. Five years. [pause] The youngest one, she was three when he left—she doesn't even remember him. And now she gets to, um... she gets to meet her dad all over again. [sniffle] I try to stay professional, you know? Keep that boundary. But when the eldest daughter started translating for her mom, telling me how they've been video calling every single night, how the dad reads them bedtime stories through a screen at 3 AM his time—[voice breaking] I had to excuse myself for a minute. [clearing throat] Sometimes this job feels like pushing paper. And then sometimes, sometimes you get to be the person who brings a family back together. [very sincerely] That's why I do this. That's exactly why.
610. [exhausted] They finally called me a legend today. [pause] The actual word. Legend. [bitter] Twenty years, and I'm finally... hmm, I'm finally what I always wanted to be, right? [sigh] Except I can't even feel it properly. [very sad] I'm on three different medications just to, um... just to get through the day. [shaky voice] My therapist says I have—what did she call it—severe burnout with, uh, depressive episodes. [regretful] God, when did I last actually sleep without pills? [quietly] I missed my daughter's recital last week because I was having panic attacks in the bathroom at that conference. [cry] She doesn't even ask me to come anymore. [pause] My wife, she... she looks at me like I'm a stranger. [bitter] But hey, I'm a legend now, right? [sarcastic] That's what matters. [very melancholic] I used to love this work, you know? Like, genuinely love it. [exhausted] Now I can't even look at my own achievements without feeling, I don't know... empty? [sigh] They're giving me some lifetime achievement thing next month. [crying while speaking] And all I can think is—what life? What life did I actually achieve?
