Scenario: A grieving widow confronts an NFT artist who has turned a viral photo of her husband's suicide into a controversial digital artwork selling for thousands of dollars.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] You turned my husband's death into an NFT, into some kind of digital trading card that strangers are bidding on like it's a piece of entertainment.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] I understand why you're here, Mrs. Chen, and I know this must seem incredibly callous from your perspective, but art has always captured moments of human tragedy.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Art? You took a photo from a news article about his accident on the bridge and slapped some neon filters on it. [shaky voice] His body is literally falling in that image.

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] The piece is called 'Final Flight' and it's meant to honor the fragility of life, not exploit it. [pause] The proceeds are going partially to mental health charities.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Partially?

Character 2 [en]: Seventy percent goes to charity, yes. The rest covers platform fees and my time creating the piece, which took weeks of digital layering and conceptual development.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] My daughter found out about this from her classmates who saw it trending on crypto Twitter. [voice breaking] They were sharing memes about her father's death because you made it famous.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] I never intended for it to become viral in that way, and I'm genuinely sorry your daughter had to experience that. [sighs] The internet can be cruel with how it handles sensitive content.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] You knew exactly what you were doing when you minted this three days after his death, when the story was still trending and people were still searching his name.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] The timing was about capturing a cultural moment when people were discussing mental health and suicide prevention, not about capitalizing on fresh grief. [clearing throat] I've created similar pieces about other tragedies.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Other tragedies? So my husband is just part of your portfolio of human suffering that you package and sell to cryptocurrency collectors? [laughs bitterly]

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Look, I understand you're grieving, but documentary photographers have been doing this for decades, from war zones to natural disasters, and NFTs are simply the modern evolution of that tradition.

Character 1 [en]: [very slowly] The difference is consent, you understand that right? [quietly] War photographers don't sell the specific death of someone's father as a collectible item. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] You're right about the consent issue, and that's something I've been grappling with since I started this series about public tragedies and their digital footprints.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] I came here to ask you to take it down, to stop the sale, but I can see you've already justified this to yourself in ways I'll never understand.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] I'll pull it from the marketplace immediately, no questions asked, and I'll transfer the current bid amount directly to your family or a charity of your choice. [long pause]

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] You will? Just like that? After defending it so thoroughly? [suspiciously] What's the catch here, because nothing about this conversation suggests you actually understand why this is wrong.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] There's no catch. Seeing you here, hearing about your daughter, it's different from the abstract idea of tragedy as artistic subject matter. [quietly] The NFT sold yesterday for forty thousand dollars. [sighs]

Character 1 [en]: [shocked] It already sold? Then what exactly are you offering to pull from the marketplace if someone already owns this digital monument to the worst day of my life? [voice breaking]

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I can burn the NFT, essentially destroy it on the blockchain, but I'd need the buyer's consent first. [very quietly] They're a collector from Singapore who specializes in controversial digital art, but I might be able to convince them.
