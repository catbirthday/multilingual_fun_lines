=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] So after fifteen years of them telling me I'm not welcome at family dinners, suddenly I get a call from the FBI saying you'll only talk to me. [pause] Pretty ironic, don't you think?

Character 2 [en]: I know how this looks, reaching out now when I never defended you back then. [sighs] But you're the only one who understands what it's like to be completely cast out.

Character 1 [en]: [patiently] I'm here, aren't I? Despite everything, despite Mom literally changing the locks when I dropped out of law school to become a tattoo artist. [chuckles] Though I have to say, this safe house is even more depressing than my first studio apartment.

Character 2 [en]: They move me every three weeks, so decorating seems pointless. [exhales] The prosecutor says after the trial I can have something more permanent, but we both know permanent is relative when you've exposed a billion-dollar fraud scheme.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] You did the right thing, reporting those falsified safety tests. Twenty thousand people could have died if those drugs hit the market. That takes more courage than anything Dad ever did with his precious medical practice.

Character 2 [en]: Dad's probably telling everyone I'm on a research sabbatical in Europe. [bitter laugh] Can't have the community knowing his golden child is hiding in a strip mall apartment eating microwave dinners.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Actually, he's been surprisingly quiet about the whole thing. Mom too. [pause] I think they're genuinely scared for you, even if they don't know how to show it without making it about themselves.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Are they asking about me? Through other people, I mean, since they won't talk to you directly?

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Aunt Carol called my shop last week, pretended she wanted a consultation about covering up her ankle butterfly. [sighs] She spent an hour asking if I'd heard from you, trying to be subtle about it but failing completely.

Character 2 [en]: God, that sounds like her. [exhales] Remember when she tried to secretly find out if you were dating someone at Christmas that one year by asking about your roommate situation?

Character 1 [en]: [laughing] And I told her I was living with three people just to watch her try to figure out the logistics. The look on her face when she couldn't determine which one might be my partner was priceless.

Character 2 [en]: You always knew how to make them uncomfortable with their own assumptions. [quietly] I envied that about you, how you could just not care what they thought.

Character 1 [en]: [honestly] I cared more than I let anyone see. Still do, probably. [pause] But caring and letting it control your life are two different things.

Character 2 [en]: I'm starting to understand that now. [sighs] Spent my whole career following every rule, being the perfect employee, and the one time I break ranks to save lives, I lose everything.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Not everything. You've got your integrity, and despite their flaws, you've got family who's worried about you. [gently] And you've got me, the family disappointment who somehow became the only person you trust.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe that's exactly why I trust you. [pause] You already know what it's like on the outside looking in, and you survived it without becoming bitter or broken.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Oh, I had my bitter phase, trust me. But spite only fuels you for so long before you have to find actual reasons to keep going. [chuckles] Turns out tattooing memorial pieces for people gave me more purpose than arguing cases ever would have.

Character 2 [en]: When this is over, when I can have a normal life again, whatever that looks like, I want to find something like that too. [exhales] Something that matters beyond corporate ladder climbing and family approval ratings.

Character 1 [en]: [supportively] You will. And for what it's worth, I'll still answer when you call, even after the FBI stops requiring it. [pause] Family is family, even the black sheep and the whistleblowers.

Character 2 [en]: Thank you for coming, really. [quietly] I know I don't deserve your forgiveness for all those years of silence when they shut you out, but I'm grateful you're here anyway. [long pause] More grateful than you know.
