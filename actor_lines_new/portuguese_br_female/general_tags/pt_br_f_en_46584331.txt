Scenario: A former vigilante avenger meets the person who saved their sister from a warehouse fire seven years ago, the same night the avenger's parents died in a coordinated arson attack.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] You're the one who pulled Sarah from the warehouse fire that night, aren't you? December third, seven years ago, the old textile district on Morrison Street.

Character 2 [en]: I remember that fire, yeah, though I didn't know her name was Sarah at the time—just a terrified kid trapped behind a wall of flames. [exhales] How did you track me down after all these years?

Character 1 [en]: Wasn't looking for you specifically, just following leads on everyone who was there that night, trying to piece together what really happened while I was three blocks away, failing to save my parents from the same arsonist.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] You couldn't have been in two places at once, and from what I remember about that night, the whole district was chaos with fires breaking out simultaneously.

Character 1 [en]: Seven years I've spent hunting the men responsible, crossing names off lists, making them pay for what they took from me. [bitter laugh] Sarah doesn't even know what I've become in the name of justice.

Character 2 [en]: She's alive because someone was there to help her, and that's what matters—not the vengeance, not the lists, just the fact that she got to grow up and have a life. [softly] What would your parents think of the path you've chosen?

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Don't.

Character 2 [en]: I've saved forty-three people since that night, kept count of every single one because it helps me sleep, helps me believe there's still good we can do in this world despite all the darkness.

Character 1 [en]: Forty-three saved.

Character 2 [en]: And you've spent those same years destroying yourself for revenge that will never bring them back, never fill that hole inside you. [sighs] I've seen what that path does to people, how it hollows them out completely.

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] You think I don't know what I've become? Every morning I look in the mirror and see someone my mother wouldn't recognize, someone my father would probably fear.

Character 2 [en]: [steadily] It's not too late.

Character 1 [en]: The last man on my list, Marcus Chen, he's the one who actually lit the fires that night—I've had him in my sights twice this month but something keeps stopping me. [voice breaking] Maybe it's knowing Sarah still needs a brother more than I need revenge.

Character 2 [en]: That something stopping you is the part of you that's still human, still capable of choosing a different way forward even after everything you've done.

Character 1 [en]: How do you do it, save people without losing yourself to the anger of watching others destroy everything good in this world?

Character 2 [en]: [thoughtfully] Every person I pull from danger is a small victory against that destruction, a tiny rebellion against the darkness. The anger's still there, I just channel it into reaching further, running faster, being better prepared for the next crisis.

Character 1 [en]: Sarah graduates nursing school next month, says she wants to work in emergency medicine, help people the way someone helped her that night—she doesn't know that someone is standing right here. [wistful] Should I tell her about you?

Character 2 [en]: That's yours to decide.

Character 1 [en]: [exhales slowly] Marcus Chen.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Let the police handle Marcus Chen, and you handle being the brother Sarah needs at her graduation—that's how you honor your parents' memory, by choosing life over death, choosing to save what's left instead of destroying what hurt you.
