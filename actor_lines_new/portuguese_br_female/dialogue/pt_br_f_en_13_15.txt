Character 1 [en]: [playful] Why are you wearing a full suit to apple picking?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, that's... okay, so here's the thing. The website said "dress for success" and I, um, I misunderstood. I thought it was some kind of corporate team-building event, not actual fruit picking.

Character 1 [en]: You couldn't figure that out from context?

Character 2 [en]: Well, in my defense, the email from HR was really vague, and they're always doing these weird metaphorical exercises. Remember the "synergy salmon swim" last quarter? That turned out to be actual swimming.

Character 1 [en]: That was a pool party, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: Right, but—but they called it professional development! Look, I realize now that I've made a mistake. These Italian leather shoes are already destroyed, and I think I just got apple juice on my tie.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] Are you having some kind of breakdown?

Character 2 [en]: No, I'm... hmm. Maybe? I've been working seventy-hour weeks for six months, and when I saw "mandatory apple picking," my brain just kind of short-circuited into autopilot corporate mode.

Character 1 [en]: Jesus. When's the last time you actually relaxed?

Character 2 [en]: Define "relaxed." Because if you mean when did I last not check emails for more than two hours, that would be, uh... actually I can't remember. February maybe?

Character 1 [en]: [laugh] You're checking your phone right now, aren't you?

Character 2 [en]: [clearing throat] Just one quick thing—no, you're right. You're absolutely right. I'm putting it away. God, when did I become this person?

Character 1 [en]: The kind who wears Armani to an orchard?

Character 2 [en]: The kind who can't even pick fruit without thinking about quarterly reports. You know what's really pathetic? I actually started calculating the profit margins on these apples while we were walking over here.

Character 1 [en]: That's... deeply concerning.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, it really is. I used to love this stuff as a kid, you know? Just being outside, getting dirty, not caring about anything except which apple looked the sweetest.

Character 1 [en]: [speeding up] Quick—that family's leaving, grab their ladder before someone else does!

Character 2 [en]: Wait, we're actually doing this? In my suit? I mean... yeah, okay, screw it. You're right. The dry cleaning bill will be worth it if I can remember what fun feels like.

Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] You really have been miserable lately, haven't you?

Character 2 [en]: Completely. But standing here with you, about to destroy a two-thousand-dollar suit for some apples... this is the first time in months I've felt like myself. The real me, not the spreadsheet version.
