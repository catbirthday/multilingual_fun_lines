Character 1 [en]: So you're saying the stars will actually align for our proposal?

Character 2 [en]: [overly polite] Oh absolutely, the coordinates are perfect! Venus will be at 17.3 degrees ascension, and Jupiter's positioned at 22.8 degrees, which creates this beautiful celestial backdrop for your moment.

Character 1 [en]: [sigh] I still don't understand all these numbers you keep mentioning.

Character 2 [en]: Right, so at 8:47 PM precisely, the constellation Cygnus will be directly overhead at 89.2 degrees elevation. That's when you'll want to drop to one knee, because the Northern Cross will literally be blessing your union from above.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, I have to time it down to the minute?

Character 2 [en]: Not exactly mandatory, but the moon's illumination will be at 34 percent, which gives you this gorgeous ambient lighting without overwhelming the stars. Plus Mars will be visible at magnitude 1.2, adding that romantic red glow to the eastern horizon.

Character 1 [en]: [enunciating every word] What if clouds roll in and ruin everything?

Character 2 [en]: Historical weather data shows only 12 percent cloud coverage probability for that date and location. But even if they do appear, Saturn rises at 9:23 PM as your backup moment, sitting pretty at 28.5 degrees altitude.

Character 1 [en]: You've really thought of everything, haven't you?

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] The Perseids meteor shower peaks that week with an expected rate of 60 meteors per hour! Nature's fireworks display, completely free of charge, starting around 10:15 PM local time.

Character 1 [en]: [chuckle] Sixty shooting stars? That seems almost too perfect.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] The zenith radiant will be at coordinates 46 degrees north, 58 degrees east, which means the meteors will appear to originate right above the lake. It's genuinely one of the most romantic astronomical events you could ask for.

Character 1 [en]: How cold will it be out there?

Character 2 [en]: [slurring] Temperature should drop to about 62 degrees Fahrenheit after sunset, so definitely bring that blanket. Oh, and Polaris will be at its standard 41.3 degrees elevation, perfect for those navigation metaphors about finding your way to each other.

Character 1 [en]: Navigation metaphors?

Character 2 [en]: [trailing off] You know, the North Star at azimuth 0 degrees, always constant, never wavering... The parallax is only 0.00766 arcseconds, making it the most stable point in our night sky...

Character 1 [en]: Should I mention any of these numbers in my speech?

Character 2 [en]: Skip the technical stuff but maybe mention that you're standing under 2,847 visible stars, based on the limiting magnitude of 5.8 at that location. It's poetic without being overwhelming.

Character 1 [en]: And you're absolutely sure about the timing?

Character 2 [en]: Sunset is at 7:52 PM, astronomical twilight ends at 9:31 PM, giving you that perfect window of darkness. Trust me, between the 15-degree angle of the ecliptic and the moon's position, this is going to be spectacular.
