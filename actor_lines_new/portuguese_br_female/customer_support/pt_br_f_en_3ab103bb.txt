Customer [en]: Hi, I called last week about... what's the word... a recurring billing issue? Need to make sure someone actually wrote it down.

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely. Let me. Pull that up. Account number? Actually wait. Phone number works too. Whatever's easiest for you right now.

Customer [en]: It's 555-0147. Are you sure you can see notes from other reps?

Customer Support [en]: Got it. 555-0147. Okay so. Hmm, let me see here. November fifteenth. There's a note. REQ-2847-B. Says billing adjustment request. Twenty-seven fifty overcharge. Is that. Is that what you called about?

Customer [en]: Yes but. That's all it says? Because I explained the whole pattern.

Customer Support [en]: No no. There's more. Let me—okay so that means. It says here. Monthly duplicate charge. Since August. Total refund pending. Ninety-six dollars even. They documented. Everything. The whole timeline.

Customer [en]: They said that last time too. Three months ago. Nothing happened.

Customer Support [en]: Oh. *exhales* I hear you. I really do. System shows. Um. Previous ticket. TKT-9823-X. September. Never processed. That's. That's not okay. At all.

Customer [en]: So what happens now? This just... disappears again?

Customer Support [en]: No. Listen. I'm putting. Personal escalation. My badge number. EMP-4429. Direct to billing supervisor. Today. Not tomorrow. Today.

Customer [en]: You're sure? Because I can't keep calling about this.

Customer Support [en]: Completely sure. Here's what. What I'm doing differently. Sending confirmation. To your email. The one on file. JSmith at gmail. With case number. REQ-2847-B. And my direct line. Extension 3847.

Customer [en]: That would actually help. But why didn't anyone do that before?

Customer Support [en]: Honestly? System doesn't. Require it. Should though. Drives me crazy too. Some reps just. Click submit. Move on. But your money matters. Your time matters.

Customer [en]: The previous rep seemed helpful too though.

Customer Support [en]: I believe that. I do. But look. Here's the thing. No follow-up scheduled. No escalation flag. Just sitting there. In queue. With eight hundred others.

Customer [en]: Eight hundred? How do I know mine won't get lost?

Customer Support [en]: Because. Right now. While we're talking. Setting reminder. My personal calendar. Thursday. Two PM. If billing hasn't processed. I'm walking it. To their desk. Myself.

Customer [en]: That's... more than anyone else offered. Will you really remember?

Customer Support [en]: Already set. Phone's buzzing Thursday. REQ-2847-B. Ninety-six dollar refund. For JSmith. 555-0147. Account ending in 7294. It's all. Right here. Not going anywhere.
