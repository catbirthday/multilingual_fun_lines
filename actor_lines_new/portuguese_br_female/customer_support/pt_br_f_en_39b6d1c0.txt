=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um I got this charge this charge on my card and I don't I don't recognize it sort of looks weird?

Customer Support [en]: Let me pull that up. Account ending in 8-8-9-2. The charge for $47.99?

Customer [en]: Yeah yeah yeah that's the one I mean I probably didn't authorize this or anything like that

Customer Support [en]: Okay so. That's your CloudSync Pro subscription. Started March fifteenth. Monthly recurring.

Customer [en]: CloudSync? Wait wait wait I think maybe I kind of remember something but that was supposed to be just the trial

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, what happened here... The trial converted. Standard process. After fourteen days it rolls to paid. Transaction ID CSP-4738-MMK.

Customer [en]: Oh god I'm I'm so stupid I totally forgot to cancel that thing I don't even use it anymore

Customer Support [en]: Happens all the time. All. The. Time. Let me—no wait—actually. Can process a partial refund. Two months. That's $95.98 back to your card.

Customer [en]: Really? That's that's actually really nice because I honestly haven't logged in since probably April or something

Customer Support [en]: Done. Refund reference R-2024-6839. Three to five business days. Subscription's canceled now too.

Customer [en]: Thank you thank you I feel kind of dumb calling about this but I just saw the charges and sort of panicked

Customer Support [en]: You've got seventeen other subscriptions active. Total monthly is $287.43. Want me to list them? Might be more you forgot.

Customer [en]: Seventeen?! Oh my god yes please I probably need to clean these up don't I

Customer Support [en]: Netflix fifteen ninety-nine. Spotify nine ninety-nine. Adobe Creative—that one's hefty—fifty-four ninety-nine. Keep going?

Customer [en]: The Adobe one I definitely definitely don't need anymore that was for a project months ago

Customer Support [en]: Canceling that. Saves you $659.88 yearly. Big one. Confirmation ADO-CANCEL-7824.

Customer [en]: This is embarrassing but um could you maybe tell me what else because I'm probably wasting so much money

Customer Support [en]: FitTrack Pro. MealPlanner Plus. Two news subscriptions—WSJ and Times. Game Pass Ultimate. Language app. $73.42 right there.

Customer [en]: I think the only ones I actually use are Netflix and Spotify honestly

Customer Support [en]: Let me see here... Cancel the rest? That's. Hmm. $203.85 back in your pocket monthly. Process it all now?
