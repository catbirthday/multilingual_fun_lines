Scenario: deck builder, anxious about a large material charge hitting before his client pays him

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I build decks for high-end clients, including the mayor's office, and I need this charge delayed.

Customer Support [en]: Got it got it okay so I'm looking at account number ACC-4521-BX here and I see a pending charge for $8,750.42 that's set to process tonight at midnight which is... what's the word... substantial for sure.

Customer [en]: That's supposed to hit Monday—no wait, Tuesday. Tuesday after my client pays.

Customer Support [en]: Right so here's what I can tell you the system shows this as a pre-authorized charge from October 28th for order MDL-9982-K and once those are in the queue they process automatically after the hold period expires which is unfortunately not something I can override.

Customer [en]: Do you understand what happens if this hits before the Hendersons pay me?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely and I hear you I really do but let me see here... hmm what if... okay so the charge hits in approximately 6 hours but I could potentially split it into two transactions of $4,375.21 each if that would help with your cash flow situation?

Customer [en]: That doesn't solve anything. Of course this would happen right when I actually need flexibility.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay wait wait I'm seeing something interesting here your account has a credit line available of $12,000 that's currently unused so technically the charge could process against that instead of your checking which would give you until November 30th to pay it off interest-free.

Customer [en]: I've been a preferred contractor for eight years and you're telling me there's nothing—sorry, absolutely nothing you can do?

Customer Support [en]: Well that's the thing I can't stop the charge but what I can do is set up an instant transfer from your credit line for exactly $8,750.42 to cover it and then you'd have that grace period I mentioned plus if you pay within 72 hours there's actually a 2% cashback bonus.

Customer [en]: Why wasn't this credit option mentioned when I placed the order?

Customer Support [en]: That's weird actually because... let me think... okay so normally orders over $5,000 trigger an automatic prompt about financing but your order MDL-9982-K shows it was placed through our contractor portal which might've bypassed that whole...

Customer [en]: Every other supplier holds charges until the date I specify. Every single one.

Customer Support [en]: Right right I get that and honestly our system is kind of... it's built more for retail than contractors which is why we have these workarounds but listen I can also add a note here with priority flag PRY-7734 for our commercial team to contact you about our new flex-pay program.

Customer [en]: Just... whatever. Transfer the credit to cover it.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect yes okay so I'm initiating transfer TRN-8845-QZ right now for the full $8,750.42 and you'll get a confirmation text in about thirty seconds with all the details about the November 30th deadline.

Customer [en]: And this won't affect my material delivery Friday—actually no, Thursday?

Customer Support [en]: Nope.

Customer [en]: Fine. At least something works today.

Customer Support [en]: Okay so you're all set the transfer is processing and just so you know for future orders if you use code FLEX30 at checkout it automatically sets up that 30-day payment delay without having to call in or do this whole credit line dance.
