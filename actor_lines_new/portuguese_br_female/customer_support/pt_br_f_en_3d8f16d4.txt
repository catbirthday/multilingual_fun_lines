=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So basically I've been... I've been trying to get this resolved for weeks and like, nobody seems to actually listen.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh—I'm really sorry you've been through that. Let me pull up your account... okay got it, account ID ACC-7749-KL. Tell me everything—I'm here to actually fix this.

Customer [en]: Wait, you actually—you actually want to hear the whole thing? Because like... it's it's kind of complicated.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely! Look—no wait—here's what we'll do. I've got your case number CSE-89234-P right here, and hmm, I can see the previous notes but I want to hear it from you directly.

Customer [en]: So my laptop died and basically I paid $289 for expedited repair but like... they lost it.

Customer Support [en]: They LOST—okay hang on. Whoa. Let me check the tracking... TRK-6628-QM shows it arriving at our facility November 3rd but then—er, this is weird—nothing after that.

Customer [en]: Exactly! And so every time I call they just... they just say "we're looking into it" but nothing happens.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. That's—ugh, that's not okay. Alright so—actually wait—I'm escalating this to our resolution team right now, ticket ESC-7792-X, because losing a $1,849 device is completely unacceptable.

Customer [en]: You're... you're really escalating it? Like actually doing something?

Customer Support [en]: Yes! And—okay between you and me? I'm marking this priority code PRI-5, which basically means it jumps ahead of everything else, should hear back within 24 hours max.

Customer [en]: Oh my God, I just—I just need someone to help me. This has been so so frustrating.

Customer Support [en]: I completely get it. Look—no actually—here's my direct extension, 4782. If you don't hear back by tomorrow 3pm, you call me directly and I'll personally track this down.

Customer [en]: You're giving me... wait wait wait, your actual extension? People never do that.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah well—this shouldn't have happened. Your case reference is REF-9923-JK7, and frankly? I'm putting a note that if we can't locate it within 48 hours, we process a full replacement at no charge.

Customer [en]: I'm sorry I just... nobody's been this helpful. So like, what what happens now exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So next steps—the escalation team will call you within 24 hours from number 800-555-7823. They'll either have located your laptop or—honestly—they'll start the replacement process immediately.

Customer [en]: And if they don't call? Because like... I've been promised callbacks before.

Customer Support [en]: Then you call me. Extension 4782. I mean it—I've set a reminder for myself for tomorrow 4pm to check your case personally if I haven't heard resolution confirmation.

Customer [en]: This is just... thank you. Thank you thank you. I actually feel like someone cares.

Customer Support [en]: Hey—of course! That's what we're here for. You've got case REF-9923-JK7, my extension 4782, and honestly? I'm gonna check on this myself tomorrow morning too, just to make sure it's moving.
