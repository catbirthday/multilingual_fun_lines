[sigh] And it's weird because I thought saying it would feel like, um... like some big weight lifting off my chest, you know? [confused] But it's more like I've been carrying this heavy box for years and years, and now that I've finally put it down, I don't know what to do with my hands. [laugh] That's stupid. [very sad] God, I spent so long hating you. Like, actively hating you every single day. [bitter] It was my first thought when I woke up and my last thought before bed. And now it's just... gone? [hesitantly] I keep reaching for it, for that anger, and there's nothing there. [cry] Which should feel good, right? [sniffle] I'm free. I'm finally, finally free from you. [very melancholic] But I'm also, I don't know, kind of... empty? Like I carved out this whole part of myself to make room for hating you, and now there's just this, uh, this hollow space. [exhausted] Maybe that's what forgiveness really is. Not peace, just... absence. [long pause] I hope wherever you are, you've forgiven yourself too. [whispering] Because I can't do that part for you."
