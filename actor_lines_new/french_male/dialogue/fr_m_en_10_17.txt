Character 1 [en]: You're holding my hand like it might explode.

Character 2 [en]: Oh god, sorry, I'm—yeah, I'm gripping pretty tight, huh? First time leading and my ex just walked in with, um, with my former roommate, so congratulations, you're basically my human shield for the evening.

Character 1 [en]: Your shield? I don't even know your name.

Character 2 [en]: Alex. And, uh, before you ask—yes, I know this is supposed to be like a formal waltz or whatever, but I'm kind of making it up as I go here. Your tie matches my dress perfectly though, which is, I mean, we look like we planned this whole thing.

Character 1 [en]: You just asked me to dance to make someone jealous?

Character 2 [en]: Initially? Yeah, pretty much. But you said yes to a complete stranger who just, like, approached you at the punch bowl, so clearly we're both running from something tonight, right? So what's—what's your damage?

Character 1 [en]: My mother's trying to set me up with her pastor's daughter. She's watching from table twelve.

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, pastor's daughter, that's... that's rough. Mine's over by the ice sculpture making out with someone who, erm, still owes me two months' rent actually. We're quite the pair of refugees, aren't we?

Character 1 [en]: You can actually dance though. Like, properly dance.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, yeah, six years of ballroom until I discovered punk rock and basically disappointed my grandmother forever. You're not terrible yourself—you just need to, mm, stop looking at your feet like they're planning something sinister.

Character 1 [en]: [apologetic] Sorry, I know I'm being weird about this.

Character 2 [en]: No no, you're fine, honestly. The trick is to pretend everyone else is, like, furniture? Expensive, judgmental furniture, but furniture nonetheless. Oh, and hey—your mother's pastor's daughter just started dancing with someone else.

Character 1 [en]: Thank God. Wait, how do you know which one she is?

Character 2 [en]: [trailing off] Pink dress, lots of ruffles, looks like she escaped from a bakery? She's been staring daggers at me since we started, so I'm thinking I accidentally entered some competition I didn't even...

Character 1 [en]: This is the weirdest rescue mission ever.

Character 2 [en]: Right? So, um, shall we continue this mutually beneficial arrangement through the next song? My ex appears to be having some serious second thoughts about his choices, and your mother just grabbed her phone—probably calling reinforcements or something.

Character 1 [en]: She wouldn't. She would. She absolutely would.

Character 2 [en]: Perfect, perfect. Then we just, uh, keep dancing until they play something awful or, I don't know, the building catches fire? I'm Alex, by the way—wait, did I already say that? I'm having this weird out-of-body experience watching myself use a stranger as a human shield here.

Character 1 [en]: [regretful] Sam. Sorry I didn't say that earlier.

Character 2 [en]: Sam! Right, okay. Well, Sam, you spin surprisingly well for someone who, like, five minutes ago looked ready to jump into the chocolate fountain. Ready for a dip? Really, um, really sell this whole thing?
