Character 1 [en]: Okay, so the bill's $87.43 and I cannot for the life of me figure out twenty percent.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, um, easiest trick in the world—move the decimal one spot left, that's ten percent, then just, you know, double it. So like $8.74 times two is... hang on... roughly seventeen fifty.

Character 1 [en]: [flirtatious] You just did that in your head? That's incredibly hot.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, math nerd alert, right? Though honestly I'm rounding pretty aggressively there. The actual amount would be, uh, seventeen forty-eight and point six cents if we're being pedantic about it.

Character 1 [en]: [passionately] But what about the moral implications of tipping on tax? This keeps me up at night!

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, the eternal debate! Look, technically you're tipping on service, not government revenue, but like, most people just tip on the total because, frankly, who has time to itemize their generosity?

Character 1 [en]: [whispering loudly] What if the service was terrible though? Like historically bad?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, that's where it gets spicy. Even with awful service I'd probably still do fifteen percent minimum because, you know, servers make like two dollars an hour and maybe they're having the worst day of their life.

Character 1 [en]: Our waiter literally forgot we existed for forty minutes.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely.

Character 1 [en]: [smiling speaking] Wait, you're still saying tip fifteen? After abandonment?

Character 2 [en]: Okay okay, hear me out though—what if he's going through a breakup? Or his cat died? I once tipped thirty percent to a crying bartender and honestly, er, best karma investment I ever made.

Character 1 [en]: You can't just karma your way through every financial decision.

Character 2 [en]: Sure I can! It's called, um, emotional economics. The universe keeps a running tab, and let me tell you, my cosmic credit score is basically immaculate at this point.

Character 1 [en]: That's not how money works.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, but that's exactly how money works when you're, like, spiritually wealthy. Plus the waiter just smiled at us—see? Already getting returns on that kindness investment, compound interest starting immediately.

Character 1 [en]: He smiled because I'm holding his tip in cash.

Character 2 [en]: Right, so, cynical but probably accurate. Though I'd argue that cash tips are actually the most ethical choice because they're harder to track for, uh, tax purposes—not that I'm advocating anything illegal here.

Character 1 [en]: You literally just advocated tax evasion.

Character 2 [en]: Hmm, advocated feels strong. I merely, you know, observed a fascinating quirk of the service industry's cash-based ecosystem while maintaining complete and total respect for all federal regulations and whatnot.
