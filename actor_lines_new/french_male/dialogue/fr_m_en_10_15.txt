Character 1 [en]: You said you'd teach me. Three months ago, you promised.

Character 2 [en]: I know, I know—life got complicated. But we're here now, aren't we? The telescope's all set up, Jupiter's perfectly positioned, and I even brought those expensive filters you wouldn't stop talking about.

Character 1 [en]: It's two in the morning.

Character 2 [en]: Best time for viewing! Light pollution's at its lowest, atmospheric distortion minimal. Plus, there's something magical about the world when everyone else is asleep—like the universe is putting on a private show just for us.

Character 1 [en]: You disappeared for three months, Marcus. Not a text, not a call.

Character 2 [en]: [very quickly] The research grant fell through, Dad had his second stroke, Elena left—everything hit at once. I couldn't drag you into that mess, couldn't be the person who dims your light when mine was barely flickering.

Character 1 [en]: I would've helped.

Character 2 [en]: That's exactly why I couldn't tell you. You fix things, it's what you do. But some things need to break completely before they can be rebuilt properly.

Character 1 [en]: Is that what you did? Break completely?

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] More or less. Spent two weeks eating nothing but instant noodles. Rock bottom has terrible cuisine.

Character 1 [en]: [trailing off] I kept checking the obituaries...

Character 2 [en]: [very excited] Wait, seriously? That's morbid! Though I suppose if I was going to make the news, it would've been for stealing that radio telescope from Caltech—which, for the record, was borrowing with aggressive intentions to return.

Character 1 [en]: You stole from Caltech?

Character 2 [en]: Borrowed! They have seventeen of them, and mine was collecting dust in storage. Besides, I made a breakthrough—found evidence of those gravitational anomalies we theorized about sophomore year.

Character 1 [en]: [chuckle] Of course you did. While having a breakdown.

Character 2 [en]: Best discoveries happen at the edges of sanity. Galileo, Tesla, that guy who invented Post-It notes—all their greatest moments came from beautiful disasters.

Character 1 [en]: Post-It notes were an accident, not a breakdown.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly my point! Failure and discovery are dance partners. Speaking of which, look through the eyepiece—Jupiter's Great Red Spot should be rotating into view right about now.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] I thought you were dead, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: Not dead, just... recalibrating. Like when you adjust a telescope's mirrors—sometimes you have to take the whole thing apart to see clearly again. But I'm here now, and the universe is waiting.
