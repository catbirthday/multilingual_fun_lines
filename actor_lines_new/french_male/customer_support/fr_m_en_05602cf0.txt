=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So I'm on break—wait no, let me see here... I got this benefits thing? About dental?

Customer Support [en]: Oh absolutely, yeah. Got your account here, employee ID EMP-7738-QZ. Dental benefits, those are confusing. Trust me, I get calls about this constantly.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... hmm, do I have coverage or not? I'm really lost here.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. So you're enrolled in plan DEN-402-BASIC, um, which covers preventive at 100%. But here's where it gets weird—fillings are only 70% after you hit your deductible.

Customer [en]: Seventy? I thought—no wait, the paper said fifty. Or was that something else?

Customer Support [en]: Mmm yeah, the paperwork's awful. What you're probably thinking of is major work—that's 50%. Your group number GRP-38269 actually has, er, pretty decent coverage compared to most.

Customer [en]: Let me think... so if I need—actually, I only have like eight minutes left on break.

Customer Support [en]: Woof, okay. Let's speed this up. You need something specific done? I can check if it's covered under code SVC-2024-DENTAL real quick.

Customer [en]: I guess—look, just tell me what I need to do for a crown.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. Crown's major work, so... hmm, you'd pay 50% after your $250 deductible. Estimate code EST-9947 shows about $600 out of pocket.

Customer [en]: Six hundred? That's—okay so wait, is that before or after insurance?

Customer Support [en]: After. Total procedure's like $1200, insurance covers half once you hit deductible. Honestly? It's ridiculous. Medical pricing in general.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if I just... actually never mind. When does this reset?

Customer Support [en]: January first. But hey, interesting thing—you've already paid $175 toward deductible this year. Reference number REF-8823-YK shows a cleaning from March.

Customer [en]: March? I think—no that was—oh right, my wife went. Same plan?

Customer Support [en]: Erhm, checking... yep, family plan FAM-207-JOINT. She's on there. Deductible's shared, which helps.

Customer [en]: So the—let me just—basically I pay seventy-five more then half the crown?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly. Seventy-five to finish deductible, then your half. Though, oof, pre-auth code AUTH-5529-L takes maybe 10 days to process.

Customer [en]: Ten days. Of course. Whatever, just... what do I do now?

Customer Support [en]: Ah man, I know. Look, call your dentist, give them member ID MEM-8847729-B. They'll handle pre-auth. Takes forever but, well, that's how it goes unfortunately.
