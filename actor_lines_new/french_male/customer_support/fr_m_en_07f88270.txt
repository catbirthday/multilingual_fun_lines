=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Hi, um. My blender just died. Got it last year.

Customer Support [en]: Okay okay. Let me. Pull up your account here. Do you have the order number?

Customer [en]: Uh, yeah. Let me see here... ORD-4492.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect perfect. So I'm looking at. Order ORD-4492-BX. Purchased thirteen months ago. The Precision Pro model right?

Customer [en]: Yeah. Stopped working yesterday. Just... dead.

Customer Support [en]: That's. That's frustrating. So the warranty on model PPB-750. It expired. Hmm. Just last month actually.

Customer [en]: Of course it did. Er, is there anything...?

Customer Support [en]: Let me let me check something. Sometimes we have. Like. Extended coverage options. Account number AC-89234-K shows. No extended plan. But hold on.

Customer [en]: Figures. What's the word... Murphy's Law, right?

Customer Support [en]: Yeah basically. So so what I'm seeing. The warranty expired thirty-seven days ago. Which is. Pretty close. Let me check if...

Customer [en]: Thirty-seven days. Great. Um, can you maybe make an exception?

Customer Support [en]: I'm. Looking at our policy now. Code WP-2024 says. Technically no exceptions. But but. Sometimes for customers with. Good history like yours...

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... what exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So basically I can. Submit form EXC-7291. For review. It goes to. My supervisor. Takes about forty-eight hours usually.

Customer [en]: Forty-eight hours. Hmm. Better than nothing I guess.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. Also. Checking repair options. Service ticket ST-66298 would be. Eighty-nine dollars. If the exception doesn't...

Customer [en]: Eighty-nine? Er, that's like half what I paid.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah I know. The part that failed. Motor assembly MA-2847-C. It's. Pretty expensive unfortunately. But if we get approval...

Customer [en]: Fine. Submit it. Not expecting much though.

Customer Support [en]: Submitted submitted. Reference number REF-93847-TK. You'll get an email. Either way. And honestly. These sometimes. Do get approved so...
