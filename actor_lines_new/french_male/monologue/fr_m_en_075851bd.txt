Subject: Your valet service client just accused you of stealing jewelry you've never even seen

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Stealing? You're saying I stole— [confused] what jewelry? I don't even know what you're talking about. [frustrated] I've been doing this job for six years, six years, and nobody has ever— [pause] Look, I park cars. That's it. I take the keys, I park the car, I bring it back when you ask. [upset] I don't go through people's things, I don't even adjust the mirrors unless I absolutely have to. [speeding up] And now you're standing here accusing me of taking something I've literally never seen? [angry] Do you know what this could do to me? This is my job, this is how I pay my— [trailing off] 

[shaky voice] I have kids. Two kids. And you think I'd risk everything for what, some bracelet or whatever it is you think is missing? [bitter] You probably left it at home or at the restaurant or— I don't know, anywhere else. [very sad] But it's easier to blame the valet guy, right? [sarcastic] The help. That's what we are to you people. 

[furious] You know what? Check the cameras. Call the police. Do whatever you need to do because I didn't take anything. [quietly] I've never stolen a thing in my life. [pause] And the fact that you'd just assume... [sigh] God, I can't even look at you right now.
