[pause] The detective just called and, um, apparently my cameras got the whole thing—like crystal clear footage of this guy breaking into the Johnsons' place. [excited] Three months! This creep has been hitting houses for three months and my system finally nailed him! [laugh] You know what's crazy? Everyone thought I was being paranoid when I installed all those cameras. [mocking] \"Oh that's overkill, this is such a safe neighborhood.\" [frustrated] Yeah well, tell that to the twelve families he robbed. I mean, Mrs. Chen lost her grandmother's jewelry—irreplaceable stuff. [sad] The Millers, they didn't feel safe in their own home anymore. [pause] But last night, uh, around 2 AM, my motion alerts went off and there he was, just... brazenly walking through my backyard. [anxious] At first I thought maybe it was a deer or something but then I saw him trying doors, checking windows. [quickly] So I called 911 immediately, told them I had live footage, and they were here in, what, three minutes? [proud] The officer said my video is the best evidence they've gotten. [very sincerely] Honestly, I'm just so relieved this nightmare is over for everyone. [cheerful] Best two grand I ever spent!"
