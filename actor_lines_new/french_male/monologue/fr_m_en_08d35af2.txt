Subject: Getting promoted to banquet manager the same week your marriage falls apart

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: They gave me the promotion. [laugh] Banquet manager, finally. I mean, I've been working toward this for what, three years? And the same day—literally the same day—she tells me she's done. [bitter] "I can't do this anymore," she said. Just like that. After twelve years.

[short pause]

So now I'm sitting here with this, um... this champagne that HR sent over, and I don't know whether to celebrate or just... I don't know. [confused] It's like the universe is playing some kind of sick joke, you know? Here's everything you worked for professionally, oh and by the way, your personal life is completely falling apart.

[sigh]

The irony is, she always said I worked too much. [sad] That I cared more about the hotel than our marriage. And maybe she was... hmm, maybe she was right? I don't know. [frustrated] But what was I supposed to do? We needed the money, we had plans, we were going to—

[very quietly] God, we were going to travel. Remember? That was the whole point.

[pause]

Tomorrow I have to go in and act, er... act happy about this promotion. [exhausted] Smile for the team, give some inspiring speech about excellence in hospitality or whatever. Meanwhile my wife is packing her things. 

[crying while speaking] How am I supposed to care about table settings when my whole life is unraveling?
