=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Everyone keeps telling me I did the right thing. [bitter] And yeah, mathematically, I guess I did. [pause] Mom and Dad still have their house, their retirement's intact, the whole family didn't go under because of some crypto scheme that was obviously—obviously—a scam. [frustrated] But Jake won't even look at me anymore. [sigh] Three years now. Three years of nothing. [very sad] Not at Christmas, not at Mom's birthday, nothing. And I get it, I do. [regretful] I went behind his back, called the bank, froze the accounts he had access to. Made him look like a child in front of everyone. [slowly] But he was going to put up the house as collateral. Our parents' house. For some, um... for some digital currency startup that didn't even have a website. [angry] What was I supposed to do? [pause] Just let him destroy everything? [quietly] Sometimes I wonder if maybe there was another way. Like if I'd just talked to him differently, or... I don't know. [sad] But every time he got that look, that excited look, nothing could stop him. [very melancholic] He'd already blown through his inheritance, maxed out credit cards. This was different though. This was everyone's future. [hesitantly] So yeah, I made the call. [cry] And now I have a brother who's alive, who's not bankrupt, who still has a job—but who'll never forgive me. [trailing off] Maybe that's the price of being the responsible one...
