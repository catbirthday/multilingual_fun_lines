=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [very excited] I can't believe I almost walked past it! [laughs] Tout le monde se battait pour les meubles vintage à cette vente de succession, et il était là, juste posé contre le mur derrière une pile de vieux magazines. [animated] The frame was hideous—vraiment affreux, genre du plastique doré des années 70—mais la toile en-dessous... [pause] My hands were actually shaking when I picked it up. [quietly] Le coup de pinceau, la façon dont la lumière touche le visage du sujet, cette teinte spécifique d'outremer qu'il utilisait toujours dans les ombres—je savais. [confidently] Twenty years of looking at paintings, et tu reconnais tout de suite quand tu tiens quelque chose d'authentique. [chuckles] The family had no idea what they had. "Oh, ce vieux truc? Grand-père l'a acheté dans un marché aux puces dans les années 60." [incredulous] Un marché aux puces! [passionately] This is why I do this job—pour des moments comme ça. [trailing off] I kept my face completely neutral while paying, j'ai payé les 50 dollars qu'ils demandaient... [guilty] Maybe I should have told them? [quickly] Non, non, c'est les affaires, ça. [relieved] The authentication will take months, mais je suis sûr à 99% que c'est, euh... c'est du vrai. [extremely happy] A genuine Moreau, juste posé là, qui attendait quelqu'un qui saurait le reconnaître. [sigh] Putain, mon cœur bat encore à fond.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [very excited] I can't believe I almost walked past it! [laughs] Everyone else at that estate sale was fighting over the vintage furniture, and there it was, just leaning against the wall behind a stack of old magazines. [animated] The frame was hideous—like, truly awful 1970s gold plastic—but the canvas underneath... [pause] My hands were actually shaking when I picked it up. [quietly] The brushwork, the way the light hits the subject's face, that specific shade of ultramarine he always used in shadows—I knew. [confidently] Twenty years of looking at paintings, and you just know when you're holding something real. [chuckles] The family had no idea what they had. "Oh, that old thing? Grandpa bought it at a flea market in the sixties." [incredulous] A flea market! [passionately] This is why I do this job—for moments like this. [trailing off] I kept my face completely neutral while paying the fifty dollars they asked for... [guilty] Maybe I should have told them? [quickly] No, no, that's business. [relieved] The authentication will take months, but I'm ninety-nine percent sure this is, um... this is the real deal. [extremely happy] A genuine Moreau, just sitting there waiting for someone who'd recognize it. [sigh] God, my heart's still racing.
