=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [warm] I've been wanting to tell you this for a while now. Tu te rends probablement pas compte à quel point tu m'as aidé cette année. When everything was falling apart with David and the divorce papers, et puis— [pause] Putain, c'était vraiment l'enfer. [very sincerely] But you never once made me feel like I was being too much, tu vois? Même quand j'étais clairement trop intense. [chuckle] Like that time I completely broke down in the break room, c'était à propos de quoi déjà, une tasse à café? Parce que c'était une qu'on avait achetée ensemble en vacances, et j'ai complètement craqué. And you sat there with me for your entire lunch break, t'as pas dit un mot sur le fait que tu devais retourner bosser. [empathetically] You just let me talk and cry and be angry. La plupart des gens, ils essaient de tout arranger tout de suite ou ils te disent que ça va aller quand franchement, ça va pas du tout. But you just... listened. [grateful] Et je sais pas comment, mais ça a tout changé. I'm finally in a good place now, j'ai signé les derniers papiers hier d'ailleurs. [relieved] And I wanted you to know, euh, que ta patience a vraiment compté pour moi. [pause] It really did.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [warm] I've been wanting to tell you this for a while now. You probably don't even realize how much you helped me this past year. When everything was falling apart with David and the divorce papers and just— [pause] God, it was such a mess. [very sincerely] But you never once made me feel like I was being too much, you know? Even when I was definitely being too much. [chuckle] Like that time I completely broke down in the break room over, what was it, a coffee mug? Because it was one we'd bought together on vacation and I just lost it. And you sat there with me for your entire lunch break, didn't say a word about needing to get back to work. [empathetically] You just let me talk and cry and be angry. Most people, they try to fix things right away or tell you it'll be okay when it really doesn't feel okay. But you just... listened. [grateful] And somehow that made all the difference. I'm finally in a good place now, signed the last papers yesterday actually. [relieved] And I wanted you to know that, um, that your patience meant everything. [pause] It really did.
