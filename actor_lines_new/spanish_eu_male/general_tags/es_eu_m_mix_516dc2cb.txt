Scenario: A combat engineer who destroyed military equipment to prevent it from falling into enemy hands faces court-martial for destruction of government property.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] I destroyed seventeen million dollars worth of equipment in twelve minutes, Su Señoría, y lo volvería a hacer sin dudarlo si significara salvar esas 43 vidas.

Character 2 [mix]: The law doesn't operate on hypotheticals, Sargento. Destruiste propiedad del gobierno deliberadamente sin autorización directa del mando, lo cual constituye una clara violación de los Artículos 108 y 109.

Character 1 [mix]: [measured] Permission to speak freely about what actually happened that night, porque el informe oficial no refleja la situación táctica completa a la que nos enfrentábamos.

Character 2 [mix]: [coldly professional] You have three minutes to present additional context, pero entienda que los argumentos emocionales no van a cambiar los hechos legales de este caso.

Character 1 [mix]: Enemy forces were closing in on our position with RPGs, y teníamos dos opciones—abandonar el equipo intacto o inutilizarlo por completo. [exhales] El mando era inalcanzable, las comunicaciones estaban cortadas.

Character 2 [mix]: [cutting through] Standard protocol dictates you wait for authorization or defend the position until relieved, no tomar decisiones unilaterales sobre millones en activos militares.

Character 1 [mix]: [rising intensity] Standard protocol assumes you have more than eight minutes, ¡ocho minutos antes de ser arrasados por una fuerza tres veces mayor con potencia de fuego superior!

Character 2 [mix]: Lower your voice, Sargento. [pause] Este tribunal reconoce la presión de las situaciones de combate, pero eso no te otorga autoridad para saltarte la cadena de mando establecida.

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter laugh] Chain of command was Lieutenant Morrison, que se estaba desangrando en mis brazos mientras tomaba esa decisión.

Character 2 [mix]: Which brings us to the second charge—asumir el mando sin seguir los protocolos de sucesión apropiados, añadiendo otra capa de violaciones procedimentales a este caso.

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly fierce] Every soldier in that convoy is alive today, cada soldado está vivo porque elegí sus vidas por encima de unos vehículos y armas que el seguro puede reemplazar.

Character 2 [mix]: [shifting slightly] The prosecution has presented evidence that alternative extraction routes existed, rutas que podrían haber preservado tanto al personal como el equipo. ¿Cómo responde a eso?

Character 1 [mix]: Those routes were theoretical lines on a map, líneas dibujadas por analistas que nunca han pisado ese valle. [clenches jaw] El paso norte ya estaba comprometido.

Character 2 [mix]: [probing] You're asking this court to accept that your battlefield assessment superseded intelligence reports, informes de múltiples fuentes, incluyendo vigilancia por satélite de esa misma mañana?

Character 1 [mix]: [steady] I'm asking this court to recognize something basic, que los satélites no pueden oír conversaciones enemigas ni oler el gasóleo de blindados ocultos acercándose a tu posición, Su Señoría.

Character 2 [mix]: Yet you made a seventeen-million-dollar decision based on intuition, en lugar de seguir los protocolos establecidos para evacuación o defensa del equipo. [deliberately] Ese es el problema fundamental aquí.

Character 1 [mix]: [leaning forward] With respect, Your Honor, cuando tienes 43 personas mirándote esperando respuestas y los morteros empiezan a triangular tu posición, la intuición se convierte en instinto de supervivencia.

Character 2 [mix]: [weighing the words] The court will consider your testimony alongside the evidence presented. Nos reuniremos mañana a las 0900 para los argumentos finales de ambas partes.

Character 1 [mix]: Understood, Su Señoría.

Character 2 [mix]: [standing] Sergeant, off the record—esos 43 soldados han enviado cartas en tu defensa. [quieter] Eso tiene peso, independientemente de lo que diga el manual. Se levanta la sesión.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [firmly] I destroyed seventeen million dollars worth of equipment in twelve minutes, Your Honor, and I'd do it again without hesitation if it meant saving those forty-three lives.

Character 2: The law doesn't operate on hypotheticals, Sergeant. You willfully destroyed government property without direct authorization from command, which constitutes a clear violation of Articles 108 and 109.

Character 1: [measured] Permission to speak freely about what actually happened that night, because the official report doesn't capture the full tactical situation we were facing.

Character 2: [coldly professional] You have three minutes to present additional context, but understand that emotional appeals won't change the legal facts of this case.

Character 1: Enemy forces were closing in on our position with RPGs and we had two choices—abandon the equipment intact or render it completely unusable. [exhales] Command was unreachable, comms were down.

Character 2: [cutting through] Standard protocol dictates you wait for authorization or defend the position until relieved, not make unilateral decisions about millions in assets.

Character 1: [rising intensity] Standard protocol assumes you have more than eight minutes before being overrun by a force three times your size with superior firepower!

Character 2: Lower your voice, Sergeant. [pause] This court recognizes the pressure of combat situations, but that doesn't grant you authority to supersede established chain of command.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Chain of command was Lieutenant Morrison, who was bleeding out in my arms while I made that call.

Character 2: Which brings us to the second charge—assuming command without proper succession protocols being followed, adding another layer of procedural violations to this case.

Character 1: [quietly fierce] Every soldier in that convoy is alive today because I chose their lives over some vehicles and weapons that insurance will replace.

Character 2: [shifting slightly] The prosecution has presented evidence that alternative extraction routes existed which could have preserved both personnel and equipment. How do you respond?

Character 1: Those routes were theoretical lines on a map drawn by analysts who've never set foot in that valley. [clenches jaw] The northern pass was already compromised.

Character 2: [probing] You're asking this court to accept that your battlefield assessment superseded intelligence reports from multiple sources, including satellite surveillance from that very morning?

Character 1: [steady] I'm asking this court to recognize that satellites can't hear enemy chatter or smell diesel fuel from hidden armor approaching your position, Your Honor.

Character 2: Yet you made a seventeen-million-dollar decision based on intuition rather than following established protocols for equipment evacuation or defense. [deliberately] That's the core issue here.

Character 1: [leaning forward] With respect, Your Honor, when you have forty-three people looking at you for answers and mortars starting to bracket your position, intuition becomes survival instinct.

Character 2: [weighing the words] The court will consider your testimony alongside the evidence presented. We'll reconvene tomorrow at 0900 for closing arguments from both sides.

Character 1: Understood, Your Honor.

Character 2: [standing] Sergeant, off the record—those forty-three soldiers submitted letters on your behalf. [quieter] That carries weight, regardless of what the manual says. Court is adjourned.
