=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [anxious] Señor Whitmore, no le esperaba hoy. [clearing throat] Los informes mensuales están en mi despacho arriba, if you need to review them.

Character 2 [mix]: [stern] Los informes pueden esperar. [coldly] Me interesa más saber por qué tres inquilinos me llamaron directamente sobre daños de agua que supuestamente se arreglaron hace 6 meses.

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] Hubo algunas complicaciones con el contratista original. [nervously] La factura mostraba que estaba terminado, pero parece que el trabajo no estaba a la altura, so we had to bring someone else in.

Character 2 [mix]: [furious] No me mientas.

Character 1 [mix]: [quickly] Le puedo enseñar todo el papeleo, cada recibo y orden de trabajo. [speeding up] La situación de fontanería ha sido compleja, múltiples problemas en cascada desde el problema original en el sótano.

Character 2 [mix]: [condescending] Problemas en cascada. [very loudly] Qué interesante, considering the contractor you supposedly hired doesn't exist según los registros estatales!

Character 1 [mix]: [shaky voice] Tiene que haber algún error con su documentación. [quietly] Quizá están registrados bajo una empresa matriz o algo así, these things happen all the time with subcontractors.

Character 2 [mix]: [slowly] Mis contables revisaron cada transacción de la cuenta del edificio. [pause] 47.000 dólares retirados en 6 meses, todo rastreado hasta tus cuentas personales.

Character 1 [mix]: [gasps] Espere, ¡no es lo que parece! [desperately] Parte de ese dinero fue para reparaciones de emergencia que no podían esperar aprobación, I was planning to reconcile everything!

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] ¿Reparaciones de emergencia para tu hipoteca y la matrícula universitaria de tu hija? [mocking] Qué noble por tu parte priorizar esas mejoras críticas del edificio.

Character 1 [mix]: [very quietly] Por favor, llevo aquí 15 años. [regretful] Un error no debería borrar todo lo que he hecho por este edificio, for your properties.

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] ¿Un error? [angrily] My investigators found similar patterns en la propiedad Riverside y el complejo del centro que gestionabas antes de este.

Character 1 [mix]: [shocked] ¿Tenías investigadores? [trailing off] Nunca pensé que realmente... [sighs] ¿Cuánto tiempo hace que lo sabes?

Character 2 [mix]: [calmly] Tres semanas. [stern] Suficiente para documentar todo, contactar al fiscal del distrito, and freeze the accounts you thought were hidden.

Character 1 [mix]: [mumbling] Te lo devolveré, cada céntimo con intereses. [pleading] Mi familia no sabe nada de esto, they don't deserve to suffer for what I've done.

Character 2 [mix]: [coldly] Lo sabrán pronto.

Character 1 [mix]: [whispering] Por favor.

Character 2 [mix]: [formal] La policía llegará en 20 minutos para escoltarte fuera. [pause] Tu reemplazo ya tiene las llaves, and the real contractors start tomorrow.

Character 1 [mix]: [defeated] ¿Puedo al menos llamar a mi mujer antes de que lleguen? [very sad] Piensa que hoy me van a ascender, porque le dije que venías.

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] Hazlo rápido. [sighs] ¿Y James? La próxima vez que robes a alguien, don't pick someone who built an empire by noticing every missing penny.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [anxious] Mr. Whitmore, I wasn't expecting you today. [clearing throat] The monthly reports are actually on my desk upstairs if you need to review them.

Character 2: [stern] The reports can wait. [coldly] I'm more interested in why three tenants called me directly about water damage that supposedly was fixed six months ago.

Character 1: [hesitantly] There were some complications with the original contractor. [nervously] The invoice showed completion, but apparently the work wasn't up to standard, so we had to bring someone else in.

Character 2: [furious] Don't lie to me.

Character 1: [quickly] I can show you all the paperwork, every receipt and work order. [speeding up] The plumbing situation has been complex, multiple issues cascading from the original problem in the basement.

Character 2: [condescending] Cascading issues. [very loudly] That's interesting, considering the contractor you supposedly hired doesn't exist according to state records!

Character 1: [shaky voice] There must be some mistake with their filing. [quietly] Maybe they're registered under a parent company or something, these things happen all the time with subcontractors.

Character 2: [slowly] I had my accountants pull every transaction from the building account. [pause] Forty-seven thousand dollars withdrawn over six months, all traced back to your personal accounts.

Character 1: [gasps] Wait, that's not what it looks like! [desperately] Some of that money went to emergency repairs that couldn't wait for approval, I was planning to reconcile everything!

Character 2: [bitter] Emergency repairs to your mortgage and your daughter's college tuition? [mocking] How noble of you to prioritize those critical building improvements.

Character 1: [very quietly] Please, I've been here fifteen years. [regretful] One mistake shouldn't erase everything I've done for this building, for your properties.

Character 2: [firmly] One mistake? [angrily] My investigators found similar patterns at the Riverside property and the downtown complex you managed before this one.

Character 1: [shocked] You had investigators? [trailing off] I never thought you'd actually... [sighs] How long have you known about this?

Character 2: [calmly] Three weeks. [stern] Long enough to document everything, contact the district attorney, and freeze the accounts you thought were hidden.

Character 1: [mumbling] I'll pay it back, every penny with interest. [pleading] My family doesn't know anything about this, they don't deserve to suffer for what I've done.

Character 2: [coldly] They'll find out soon enough.

Character 1: [whispering] Please.

Character 2: [formal] The police will be here in twenty minutes to escort you out. [pause] Your replacement already has the keys and the real contractors start tomorrow.

Character 1: [defeated] Can I at least call my wife before they arrive? [very sad] She thinks I'm getting a promotion today because I told her you were coming by.

Character 2: [quietly] Make it quick. [sighs] And James? Next time you steal from someone, don't pick someone who built an empire by noticing every missing penny.
