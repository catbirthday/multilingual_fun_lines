Subject: Your rebel phase in college is now embarrassing but also gave you the confidence to start your own business

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [chuckle] God, I found my old college photos yesterday. [embarrassed] The purple mohawk, the facial piercings, the whole "capitalism is evil" phase while I was literally living off my parents' money. [laugh] I mean, I wrote manifestos about destroying the system! [cringing] Posted them on Facebook too, which is just... permanent digital evidence of me being an absolute tool. [pause] But you know what's weird? [thoughtfully] All that rebellious energy, that whole "I don't care what anyone thinks" attitude—it's, um, it's exactly what I needed to start my business. [animated] Like, when everyone said opening a vintage bookstore was stupid, that I'd fail in six months? [confidently] I just remembered how I used to walk into philosophy class wearing combat boots and a tutu, completely unbothered. [smiling speaking] Same energy, different application. [laugh quietly] My investors have no idea they're working with someone who once spray-painted "QUESTION EVERYTHING" on the dean's parking spot. [warmly] Though honestly, that mindset of questioning everything? [passionately] That's what made me see the gap in the market that everyone else missed. [sigh] So yeah, deeply embarrassing but also... kind of grateful for that ridiculous kid. [chuckle] Even with the mohawk.
