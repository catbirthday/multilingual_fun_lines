[sigh] I thought I was being so careful but I— I must have misunderstood the new system update and... Jesus Christ, the Hendersons. [regretful] They called last week asking why their daughter's chemotherapy wasn't covered. And I told them they made too much money. [shaky voice] But they didn't. They qualified. She qualified and I— [pause] How many others? The woman with diabetes who cried on the phone. The grandfather who needed heart medication. [upset] All of them could have had coverage this whole time. [sniffle] They probably went without treatment, or went into debt, or... I don't even want to think about what else. [very sad] Some of these people, they trusted me when I said they didn't qualify. They didn't even appeal because I sounded so sure. [crying while speaking] I was so sure I was doing it right. How do I even begin to fix this? How do I call these families and tell them that their suffering was because I, um... because I couldn't do basic data entry correctly? [whisper] God, what have I done?"
