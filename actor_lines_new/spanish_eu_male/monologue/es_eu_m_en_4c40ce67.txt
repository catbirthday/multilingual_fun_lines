Speaker [en]: [frustrated] God, I can't believe she actually said that to me in front of everyone. [angry] Like, who does that? Who just completely undermines someone's entire presentation and then acts like they're doing you a favor? [sigh] I spent three weeks on that proposal. Three weeks! [upset] And she just— she just dismissed it in two minutes like it was nothing. [pause] The worst part is everyone just sat there. Nobody said anything. [bitter] They all just looked at their laptops and pretended it wasn't happening. [quietly] I felt so small. [sad] Maybe I am just not cut out for this job. Maybe she's right and I'm, um... I'm just fooling myself thinking I belong here. [long pause] But wait. [confused] Why am I letting her opinion define me? [slowly] She's been here what, six months? [confidently] I've been doing this for four years. I know my stuff. [animated] Actually, you know what? That proposal was solid. [excited] The numbers were perfect, the timeline made sense, everything was— [laugh] Oh my God, she's just threatened by me, isn't she? [relieved] That's what this is about. [chuckle] She sees me as competition. [happy] Well, that's actually kind of, uh... flattering in a weird way. [smiling speaking] Tomorrow I'm going straight to David with my proposal. [very excited] Let's see what he thinks when he actually reads it!
