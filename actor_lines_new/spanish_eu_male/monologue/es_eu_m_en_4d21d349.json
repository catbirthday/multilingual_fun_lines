[relieved] Jesus Christ, I thought I was about to witness something horrible. [pause] The way you just grabbed him, I mean, the reflexes on you were... wow. [exhale] I'm still shaking. [grateful] You literally saved that kid's life, you know that? [anxious] His mom didn't even see it happening, she was looking at her phone and, um... God, it happened so fast. [empathetically] I can't imagine how she's going to feel when she realizes what almost— [trailing off] ...what you prevented from happening. [very sincerely] Seriously, I don't think you understand how incredible that was. [warm] The way you just dropped everything and moved, like, without even thinking about it? [excited] That was pure instinct, pure... I don't know, heroism? [chuckle] I mean, I'm using big words here but that's what it was. [happy] That little boy is going home tonight because of you. [pause] [very quietly] I keep replaying it in my head and it's just... phew. [relieved] Thank God you were there. Really. Thank God."
