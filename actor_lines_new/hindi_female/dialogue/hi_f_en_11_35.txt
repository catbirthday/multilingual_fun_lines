Character 1 [en]: Hey, I heard about what happened with the project. You really saved us back there.

Character 2 [en]: Oh wow, I mean, honestly I was just doing what anybody would've done in that situation, but, uh, I really appreciate you saying that because I was actually terrified I'd made things worse by jumping in like that.

Character 1 [en]: No no, you caught that database error before it corrupted everything. That was— that was incredible.

Character 2 [en]: [very slowly] You know, I've been wanting to tell you how grateful I am that you even trusted me to look at it in the first place, because most people wouldn't have let a junior developer near something that critical.

Character 1 [en]: Well you've proven yourself. Multiple times now, actually.

Character 2 [en]: [deep pitch] That means, um, more than you probably realize. I've been dealing with some serious imposter syndrome lately, and hearing that from you specifically, someone whose work I've admired for, gosh, years now, it's kind of overwhelming in the best way.

Character 1 [en]: Years? You've been following my work for years?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, yeah, since that, uh, that conference talk you gave in Boston about microservices architecture. That presentation literally changed how I approach system design, and I mean, here I am actually working with you which is still sort of surreal honestly.

Character 1 [en]: I had no idea. Why didn't you ever mention this before?

Character 2 [en]: Well, I didn't want to come across as, you know, some weird fanboy or whatever, but also I guess I wanted you to judge my work on its own merits rather than thinking I was just trying to, er, butter you up or something.

Character 1 [en]: That's... actually really professional of you. Most people would've name-dropped immediately.

Character 2 [en]: Thanks for understanding that. Look, I also wanted to say thank you for how you handled things with management yesterday, when they were trying to blame the delays on our team—you really stood up for us.

Character 1 [en]: They were being unfair. Someone had to say something.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah but not everyone would've risked their own reputation like that. The way you just calmly laid out the timeline and showed them where the bottlenecks actually were, it was, mmm, masterful honestly, and we all noticed.

Character 1 [en]: The whole team noticed? Oh god, was I that obvious about being annoyed?

Character 2 [en]: [sniffle] No no, you were incredibly professional, which made it even more impressive actually. Sorry, I'm getting a bit emotional here but this job means everything to me and knowing someone like you has our backs is just, er, it's huge.

Character 1 [en]: Hey, you okay? You don't need to— I mean, we're a team, right?

Character 2 [en]: [clearing throat] Yeah, sorry, I'm fine, just having a moment. But seriously though, the way you mentor without making it feel like mentoring, and how you share credit even when you did most of the work, I'm learning so much about leadership from you.

Character 1 [en]: I think you're giving me way too much credit here. You contribute just as much.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe, but I don't think you realize how rare it is to find someone who actually creates space for others to grow. Every day I come in here feeling, um, grateful that I get to work with someone who makes me want to be better at this, you know?
