Character 1 [en]: Do you remember your dreams?

Character 2 [en]: Every single night, actually. I keep this notebook by my bed and scribble them down before they disappear—it's wild how fast they fade once you start moving around.

Character 1 [en]: What was last night's about?

Character 2 [en]: [bored] I was back in my childhood home, except all the rooms were connected wrong and my dead grandmother was making pancakes. Pretty standard anxiety dream stuff, nothing particularly creative this time around.

Character 1 [en]: Why do you write them down?

Character 2 [en]: Started doing it after reading that Carl Jung book about dream analysis. Plus there's something fascinating about tracking patterns—like I dream about water every time I'm stressed about money, which is weirdly specific.

Character 1 [en]: Do you believe dreams mean anything?

Character 2 [en]: I think they're basically your brain doing maintenance work, filing away memories and processing emotions. But sometimes they feel way too pointed to be random, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Ever had a lucid dream?

Character 2 [en]: Three times total, and each time I immediately tried to fly and woke myself up from the excitement. There's supposed to be techniques to get better at it but honestly I'm too lazy to practice.

Character 1 [en]: [playful] What would you do if you could control your dreams perfectly?

Character 2 [en]: Probably just have normal conversations with people I miss. Maybe visit places that don't exist anymore, like my grandparents' old farm before they sold it.

Character 1 [en]: That's surprisingly wholesome.

Character 2 [en]: Right? Everyone expects sex dreams or superpowers but honestly I just want to pet my childhood dog again and tell him he was a good boy.

Character 1 [en]: [excited] Have you ever had those falling dreams?

Character 2 [en]: [laugh loudly] God yes, and I actually kick my partner every single time! Apparently it's called a hypnic jerk—your brain thinks you're dying as you fall asleep so it jolts you awake.

Character 1 [en]: Do you dream in color?

Character 2 [en]: Always in color, which apparently not everyone does. My sister swears she dreams in black and white but I think she's just being pretentious about it.

Character 1 [en]: What's the worst nightmare you've had?

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] The ones where nothing scary happens but everyone I love just... doesn't recognize me. Those stick with me for days, make me feel hollow in this really specific way.
