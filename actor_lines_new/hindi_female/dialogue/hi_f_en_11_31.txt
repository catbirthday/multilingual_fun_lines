Character 1 [en]: I need help! The IRS sent me seventeen different letters and I think they're watching me through my microwave!

Character 2 [en]: Hey, whoa, okay, let's take a deep breath together. Getting multiple IRS notices can definitely feel overwhelming, but I promise you they're not monitoring your appliances—they're probably just duplicate notices or, um, follow-ups about the same issue.

Character 1 [en]: But wait, should I burn my receipts? I heard they can track the ink!

Character 2 [en]: Oh no no no, actually keeping your receipts is really important for your records! The ink thing is, uh, totally a myth—the IRS just wants proper documentation, and honestly, having everything organized will make you feel so much more in control of the situation.

Character 1 [en]: What if I just move to Canada? Or maybe International waters?

Character 2 [en]: Ah, I get it, sometimes tax stuff makes us want to run away! But here's the thing—U.S. citizens still have to file taxes abroad, and, well, living on a boat gets pretty expensive, so let's figure out what's actually going on with these notices first, yeah?

Character 1 [en]: [quickly] Can you make them stop calling me at 3 AM?!

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, that's concerning—the IRS doesn't actually call outside business hours, so those are probably scammers. Real IRS communication comes through mail first, which, you know, means those letters you got are legitimate, but any weird phone calls you can just ignore.

Character 1 [en]: I calculated that I owe negative twelve million dollars. Is that good?

Character 2 [en]: Ha, well, I love your optimism! Unfortunately the math probably needs some tweaking there, but hey, sometimes people do get refunds they weren't expecting, so let's go through your actual numbers together—I think you'll be pleasantly surprised it's not as bad as it seems.

Character 1 [en]: Should I pay them in pennies? I have SO many pennies!

Character 2 [en]: Right, okay. That's creative thinking! The IRS does technically have to accept legal tender, but, er, electronic payment or check will save you literal tons of hauling—plus you'll get confirmation immediately, which gives you that peace of mind, you know?

Character 1 [en]: What if I claim my houseplants as dependents? They depend on me!

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, I absolutely love how much you care about your plants! Unfortunately dependents need Social Security numbers, but there might be home office deductions if you work from home, and honestly, having plants around while dealing with taxes makes everything more pleasant anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I... I haven't filed in three years. Am I going to jail?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, okay, first off—you're not going to jail, alright? Lots of people fall behind on filing, and the fact that you're reaching out now shows you want to fix this, which is, like, really brave actually, and the IRS has payment plans and programs specifically for situations like yours.

Character 1 [en]: But what if they take my cat?! Mr. Whiskers is all I have!

Character 2 [en]: [smiling speaking] Ah, Mr. Whiskers is completely safe, I promise! The IRS doesn't take pets, ever—they're interested in monetary assets, not family members, and honestly, having Mr. Whiskers there while we sort through paperwork will probably make this whole process way less stressful.

Character 1 [en]: Can you just... make it all go away? Please?

Character 2 [en]: I really wish I had a magic wand for that, but here's what I can do—I'll help you understand exactly what you owe, set up a manageable payment plan, maybe even reduce some penalties, and, um, most importantly, we'll tackle this together so you don't have to feel alone in it anymore.
