Character 1 [en]: So I heard you're getting into gardening this spring. Planning to do any seeding?

Character 2 [en]: [very slowly] Oh. Um, yeah, I guess I'm supposed to be excited about that but honestly? Starting seeds indoors feels like, I don't know, babysitting incredibly boring plants that might just die anyway, and then you have to deal with all those little plastic trays everywhere.

Character 1 [en]: Come on, it can't be that bad. What are you planning to grow?

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Just tomatoes and maybe some peppers, nothing fancy. My partner insists we need to start from seed to save money, but between the grow lights and heating mats and special seed-starting mix, I mean, we could probably just buy mature plants for less hassle.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] But but but isn't it rewarding to watch them grow from tiny seeds?

Character 2 [en]: Eesh, I suppose some people find watching grass grow exciting too. The whole process takes forever—you plant these microscopic things, wait weeks for germination, then more weeks of, like, constantly checking moisture levels and rotating trays under lights, and half of them get leggy anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [deep pitch] You sound really passionate about this.

Character 2 [en]: [enunciating every word] I just think there are better uses of my time than misting dirt twice a day. Plus our cat keeps trying to eat the seedlings, so now we have to barricade the whole setup, which, honestly, makes our dining room look like some kind of agricultural crime scene.

Character 1 [en]: Have you tried different seed starting methods? Maybe soil blocks?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, yeah, I've looked into it but that seems even more tedious. You need special tools to compress the soil, and apparently the blocks can just crumble if you handle them wrong, so it's basically adding more ways for things to go catastrophically wrong.

Character 1 [en]: What about direct sowing outside?

Character 2 [en]: [very meekly] That would be easier, I guess, but then you're at the mercy of weather and, um, birds and slugs. Last year I direct sowed lettuce and literally watched sparrows pull up every single seedling the day they sprouted—it was actually kind of impressive how thorough they were.

Character 1 [en]: So you've done this before! Any successful varieties?

Character 2 [en]: Huh, define successful. The zucchini grew, but then it grew too much and we were basically drowning in squash by July, giving them away to anyone who'd make eye contact, which, er, turns out people get real good at avoiding you when you're known as the zucchini person.

Character 1 [en]: [very slowly] Maybe you should try flowers instead of vegetables?

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Oh god no, flowers are even worse because at least vegetables you can eat if they survive but flowers just sit there demanding deadheading and fertilizer and then they die at the first frost anyway so what's even the point really?

Character 1 [en]: You could try perennials—they come back every year.

Character 2 [en]: Right, except they need stratification and scarification and vernalization, like, these seeds apparently need a whole PhD dissertation worth of preparation. Some need cold treatment in the fridge for months, others need their seed coats filed down, I mean, it's basically plant surgery at that point.

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Sounds like you've really researched this though.

Character 2 [en]: Ugh, yeah, that's the worst part—I've spent hours reading about optimal germination temperatures and photoperiod requirements, and for what? So I can stress about whether my basil seedlings are getting fourteen or sixteen hours of light while actual farmers are out there just... throwing seeds in dirt and making it work somehow.
