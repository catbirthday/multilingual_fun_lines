Scenario: A wardrobe supervisor discovers they've inherited substantial shares in the media conglomerate that just cancelled their show, meeting with a shareholder services representative to decide what to do with them.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So you're telling me I inherited twelve thousand shares in the very company that just cancelled our show after three seasons and put forty people out of work.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I understand this must feel complicated, inheriting from your aunt just as the network made that decision about your production—the timing is unfortunate, to say the least.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] Unfortunate? I spent fourteen-hour days making sure every button and hem was perfect, and now I own a piece of the machine that threw us all away.

Character 2 [en]: [measured] The shares are worth about three hundred thousand at current market value, though I imagine that's not exactly, [sighs], what you want to hear right now given the circumstances.

Character 1 [en]: [dryly] Oh fantastic, blood money from corporate vampires who think algorithmic data matters more than the stories we were telling or the community we built.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I've processed a lot of these emotional liquidations over the years, and sometimes the best revenge is taking their money and doing something meaningful with it.

Character 1 [en]: Like what?

Character 2 [en]: [leaning forward] You could fund an independent production, start a costume archive for emerging designers, or even buy enough additional shares to show up at shareholder meetings and raise hell about their programming decisions.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, you're seriously suggesting I use their own money to become a thorn in their side at every quarterly meeting? [intrigued]

Character 2 [en]: I'm suggesting that three hundred thousand dollars of voting shares gives you a voice in that boardroom, and based on what you've told me, you have quite a lot to say. [slight smile]

Character 1 [en]: My aunt worked there for thirty years in accounting.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Margaret Chen, right? She was legendary for grilling executives about budget waste during earnings calls—made the CEO sweat bullets every single time she grabbed the microphone.

Character 1 [en]: [laughing] That sounds exactly like Aunt Maggie.

Character 2 [en]: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, based on how you walked in here ready to liquidate everything out of pure spite—she'd probably prefer you keep them and fight.

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtfully] You know what? Maybe I'll keep half and use the other half to help my crew members who are struggling to make rent after the cancellation.

Character 2 [en]: [nodding] Now that's a plan that would make Margaret proud—practical support for your people while keeping enough ammunition to make the executives uncomfortable at every opportunity.

Character 1 [en]: Can you show me her history of shareholder meeting attendance? I want to see exactly how she made them squirm—maybe pick up some of her techniques.

Character 2 [en]: I have twelve years of transcripts where she absolutely eviscerated their decision-making, [chuckles], including one legendary meeting where she brought printed receipts of executive lunches while they were laying off writers.

Character 1 [en]: [determined] Set me up with whatever paperwork I need to attend the next meeting—I've got three seasons' worth of costume budget irregularities they never thought anyone would notice.

Character 2 [en]: Welcome to corporate activism, Ms. Chen—your first shareholder meeting is in six weeks, and I have a feeling you're going to make it memorable. [grins]
