Subject: Finally solving the DNA cold case that's haunted your lab for fifteen years

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Wait. No, that can't be right. Run it again. Run it— [gasp] Oh my God. Oh my God, it's a match. The degraded sample from the warehouse actually... [very quietly] It's him. It's really him. Fifteen years of this case sitting on my desk, fifteen years of the family calling, asking if there's anything new, and I— [shaky voice] I finally have something to tell them. Look at these markers. Perfect alignment across all loci. This is, um... this is ironclad. [excited] The new extraction protocol worked! I knew if we could just isolate enough intact DNA from the fabric... God, how many times did I retest that evidence? Hundreds? [pause] Jessica always said I was obsessed. She'd bring me coffee at 2 AM, find me still running gels. "The case will still be cold tomorrow," she'd say. [emotional] But it's not cold anymore. William Harper, 34, construction worker from Riverside. That's who killed the Brennan girl. [very sincerely] Mia Brennan would've been thirty-two this year. Same age as my daughter. [relieved] I can finally give her parents an answer. After all this time, they're going to know who took their baby. [sigh] Fifteen years. But we got him.
