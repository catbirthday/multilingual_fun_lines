Subject: A regular customer left a note saying your cheerful service at the coffee cart helped them through cancer treatment

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [confused] अरे ये... ये Mrs. Chen की तरफ से है? [pause] वो aunty जो हर सुबह, उम्म, oat milk latte लेती हैं? [shaky voice] हे भगवान। [long pause] उन्हें cancer था इतने समय से और मुझे—मुझे तो पता ही नहीं था। [very quietly] राम। [clearing throat] यहाँ लिखा है कि मेरी "cheerful service" ने उनकी treatment में मदद की, and I'm just completely stunned. [sniffle] मैं तो बस coffee बना रही थी, समझी ना? जैसे, मैं उनकी बिल्लियों के बारे में पूछती थी और, अ, मौसम की शिकायत करती थी, Monday mornings के बारे में बेकार jokes मारती थी। [crying while speaking] और apparently वो मायने रखता था। [pause] किसी के लिए जो इतनी बड़ी... इतनी बड़ी लड़ाई लड़ रही थी, that actually mattered. [exhale] यार, मुझे ऐसा लग रहा है, हम्म, क्या बोलूं—guilty? कि मुझे पता नहीं था? But also kind of honored, you know? [warm] वो हर दिन आती थीं। बारिश हो या धूप। [shaky voice] और वो मेरे साथ हमेशा इतनी sweet रहती थीं, पूछती थीं कि मेरी classes कैसी चल रही हैं, and this whole time she was fighting for her life. [sigh] [very sincerely] सच में कभी पता नहीं चलता ना, लोग अंदर से क्या झेल रहे हैं? [pause] मैं इस note को, उम्म... frame करवाऊंगी। [smiling speaking] और कल जब वो आएंगी, their coffee is definitely on the house.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [confused] Wait, this is... this is from Mrs. Chen? [pause] The lady with the, um, the oat milk latte every morning? [shaky voice] Oh my God. [long pause] She had cancer this whole time and I didn't—I had no idea. [very quietly] Jesus. [clearing throat] It says my "cheerful service helped her through treatment" and I'm just... wow. [sniffle] I was literally just making coffee, you know? Like, I'd ask about her cats and, uh, complain about the weather and make dumb jokes about Monday mornings. [crying while speaking] And apparently that mattered. [pause] That actually mattered to someone going through... through that. [exhale] God, I feel so, hmm, I don't know—guilty? That I didn't know? But also kind of... honored? [warm] She came every single day. Rain or shine. [shaky voice] And she was always so sweet to me, asking how my classes were going, and the whole time she was—[sigh] she was fighting for her life. [very sincerely] You never really know what people are carrying, do you? [pause] I'm gonna, um... I'm gonna frame this note. [smiling speaking] And tomorrow when she comes in, her coffee's on me.
