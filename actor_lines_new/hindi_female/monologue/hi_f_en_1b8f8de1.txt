Subject: Finally getting promoted to regent after years of preparation, but inheriting a kingdom on the brink of economic collapse

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: The seal is finally mine. [bitter] Twenty-three years of studying trade routes and tax codes, and they hand me a kingdom with empty coffers. [laugh] The treasury report came in this morning—we have enough gold to last maybe, um... maybe three months if we're lucky. [anxious] Three months before the entire realm realizes we can't pay the army. [pause] I keep thinking about Father's lessons, you know? [mocking] "A regent must be prepared for any crisis, my child." [frustrated] Well he didn't prepare me for THIS. [sarcastic] Nobody mentioned the previous council had been borrowing against future harvests for the past decade. [very quietly] God, the debts to the merchant guilds alone could... [trailing off] [clearing throat] But I can't—I won't let this be how my regency begins. [confidently] There has to be a way through this. [hesitantly] Maybe if we renegotiate with the eastern provinces first? [quickly] Or sell some of the crown lands—no, that's desperation talking. [sigh] Mother always said I was too ambitious for my own good. [very sad] Turns out the throne I've been chasing is more like a, uh, like a beautifully decorated prison cell. [determined] Still. I didn't study all those years just to watch everything crumble. [exhausted] I just need to think.
