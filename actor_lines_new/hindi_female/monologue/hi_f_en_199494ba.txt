Subject: Becoming the maintenance supervisor at the hospital where your spouse is terminally ill

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: They offered me the position yesterday. [quietly] Maintenance supervisor. [short pause] Same hospital where Sarah's been for, what, three months now? [sigh] And I know it looks—I mean, people are going to think I'm using this situation to get ahead or something, but that's not... [frustrated] God, that's not what this is about. [pause] The thing is, um, I've been driving forty-five minutes each way just to sit with her for an hour before visiting hours end. [tired] Now I can just... walk down the hall. [very quietly] Check on her during lunch. [sniffle] Make sure her room's the right temperature because she's always, always cold now. [sad] And yeah, the pay's better, which—Jesus, the medical bills are just... [bitter] anyway. [long pause] Tom from HR, he pulled me aside and said, er, "We understand your situation." [mocking] Like it's a situation. [angry] Like my wife dying is some kind of inconvenience we're all working around. [pause] But I took it. [resigned] Of course I took it. [whispering] I'll know every supply closet, every shortcut, every quiet corner where I can just... [cry] where I can fall apart for five minutes and then go back to fixing things. [shaky voice] Because that's what I do now, right? [very sad] I fix the broken doors and the leaky pipes while Sarah's body just keeps... [trailing off]
