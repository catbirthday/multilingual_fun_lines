Subject: Your informant work finally taking down the corrupt cop while destroying your faith in the system

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: They got him. Rodriguez is finally behind bars, twenty years of... God. [bitter] Twenty years of everyone knowing and nobody doing anything. I wore that wire for eight months, you know? Eight months of pretending I didn't know he was skimming drug money, planting evidence on kids who—Jesus, some of them were barely sixteen. [upset] And the whole time, his captain knew. The commissioner knew. They all fucking knew.

[exhausted] I thought when we got the recording of him bragging about that planted gun, I thought that would be it, right? Justice served, system works. [sarcastic] Except then I find out they only moved on him because he stopped paying his cut upstairs. Not because of the kids he framed or the lives he destroyed, but because he got greedy with the money.

[quietly] You want to know the worst part? When they arrested him, half the precinct was there to shake his hand goodbye. Like he was some kind of, I don't know, retiring hero or something. [angry] These are the same cops who are supposed to protect people! And they're all in on it, every last one of them.

[very sad] I used to believe in this. I really did. Now I just... what was even the point? He's gone but there's ten more just like him still wearing badges. [trailing off] And tomorrow I have to go back and pretend like any of this matters...
