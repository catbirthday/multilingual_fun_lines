Subject: Finally proving your difficult parent wrong about your life choices, but realizing they won't be around much longer to see your success

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [bitter] I got the promotion. Regional director, just like I said I would. Twenty-eight years old and I'm running three offices. Remember when you said art school was a waste? That I'd never make real money "drawing pictures"? [pause] Well, creative directors at Fortune 500 companies do pretty well, turns out. [slowly] And now you're... what, maybe six months left, they said? [sad] God, I wanted this moment for so long. I had this whole speech planned, you know? About how wrong you were, how I didn't need your approval, how I— [sigh] But looking at you in that hospital bed, none of that matters anymore. [very quietly] You can barely stay awake for ten minutes. [regretful] I spent so many years being angry, proving you wrong, and now that I finally can, it's just... hollow. You won't see the house I'm buying. Won't meet whoever I marry. [crying while speaking] I thought vindication would feel better than this. [pause] Maybe you were trying to protect me in your own messed-up way. I don't know. [very melancholic] I just wish we'd had this conversation five years ago, when there was still, um... when there was still time to fix things.
