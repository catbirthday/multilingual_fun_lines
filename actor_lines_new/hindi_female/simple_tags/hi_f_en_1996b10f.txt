Scenario: A pension trustee confronts their longtime colleague who has been embezzling funds from retirees' accounts for years.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Harold, I need you to explain these account discrepancies before I call the authorities. [pause] Twenty-three separate pension accounts, all showing withdrawals that weren't authorized by the beneficiaries.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] Margaret, after thirty years working together, you know I've always been meticulous with the books. [clearing throat] Perhaps you should review those records again before making any hasty accusations.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Don't patronize me, Harold. [firmly] I've checked them three times, and each withdrawal traces back to dummy accounts you created using variations of deceased members' names.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] You're stressed about the upcoming audit, I understand that completely. [chuckles] Remember when we used to stay late double-checking everything together, back when this office still had typewriters?

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Those were good times, yes, which makes this betrayal even harder to stomach. [trembling] Mrs. Patterson called yesterday crying because she couldn't afford her husband's medication.

Character 2 [en]: [dismissive] The Pattersons have always been terrible with money, you can't blame their financial troubles on clerical errors. [sighs] Besides, the fund has millions in surplus reserves that nobody even tracks properly.

Character 1 [en]: [angrily] Clerical errors? [very loudly] You stole eight hundred thousand dollars from people who worked their entire lives for those pensions!

Character 2 [en]: [monotone] Prove it, Margaret. [pause] Every transaction has proper documentation, committee approvals, all the signatures you helped me gather over the years.

Character 1 [en]: [gasps] You forged my signature too? [very quietly] Harold, I defended you when the board questioned those investment losses last year, I vouched for your integrity.

Character 2 [en]: [condescending] Your signature was already on the approval forms, dear, you just never read what you were signing. [laughs] Too trusting, that's always been your weakness in this business.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] How long?

Character 2 [en]: [casually] Since my wife's cancer diagnosis, about six years now. [exhales] Medical bills don't pay themselves, and the board denied my request for an advance on my own pension.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] I didn't know about Martha's illness, Harold, but stealing from retirees wasn't the answer. [sighs] Some of these people are choosing between food and medicine every month.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Don't lecture me about choices, Margaret! [angrily] I've given this organization forty years of my life, and they couldn't spare anything when I needed it most.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] The police are already on their way.

Character 2 [en]: [cheerful] Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, I called them myself an hour ago. [pause] Told them about the irregular transfers you've been making to that offshore account in your maiden name.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What offshore account? [gasps softly] Harold, you didn't create accounts in my name too, this can't be happening right now.

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] The beautiful thing about working together so long is knowing exactly how someone signs their name, their social security number, their mother's maiden name. [chuckles] We're in this together now, partner.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] You won't get away with this, Harold! [shouting] I have copies of everything, the real documents, stored safely where you'll never find them!

Character 2 [en]: [amused] The safety deposit box at First National, or the filing cabinet in your basement? [slowly] Margaret, I've been three steps ahead of you for years, and retirement's looking quite comfortable from where I'm sitting.
