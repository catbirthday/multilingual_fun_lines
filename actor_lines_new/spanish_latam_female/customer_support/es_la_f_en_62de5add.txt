=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So basically I run three clinics. These coding errors? Unacceptable.

Customer Support [en]: Oh wow okay let me pull up your account right away—um, I see you're with account PRV-4482-MN and yeah there's definitely some activity here that looks, er, let me dig into these codes real quick because I'm seeing multiple rejections.

Customer [en]: Do you know how long I've been with you? Eight years.

Customer Support [en]: Eight years absolutely and I can see that loyalty status right here—actually wait I think I found something interesting, so these CPT codes 97110 and 97530 are getting kicked back but, uh, lemme check our latest bulletin because sometimes the modifiers change without much notice.

Customer [en]: *exhales* Like, my staff can't work for free here.

Customer Support [en]: No no of course not and—oh! Okay I see what happened here, so basically there was a system update on November 3rd that changed how modifier 59 gets processed with those specific codes and, um, it looks like about 47 claims got caught in this glitch.

Customer [en]: Forty-seven? Er, that's almost sixty thousand dollars.

Customer Support [en]: Right right I'm calculating—yeah it's $58,742 total and honestly that's, uh, that's completely our fault here so what I'm gonna do is escalate this to our rapid resolution team with case number ESC-9901-PT and they handle these within 24 to 48 hours max.

Customer [en]: Um, who's your supervisor? I need this fixed today.

Customer Support [en]: Sure sure my supervisor is Janet Chen and—actually hang on, you know what? Let me try something else first because I might be able to... what's the word... expedite this through our provider portal using override code OVR-7234-X.

Customer [en]: *sharp inhale* So you're saying you can fix this now?

Customer Support [en]: Well lemme see if I can—yeah! Yes actually I can resubmit all 47 claims right now with the corrected modifiers and, er, the system's showing me they'll process in 3 to 5 business days instead of the usual 15 to 20.

Customer [en]: I've referred twelve practices to you. This shouldn't happen.

Customer Support [en]: You're absolutely right and I'm making notes about that referral history—mmm, actually I'm also seeing you qualify for our platinum provider status which, uhh, honestly someone should've upgraded you to that like two years ago based on your volume.

Customer [en]: Uh, what does platinum even do for me?

Customer Support [en]: Oh this is good actually—so platinum gets you a dedicated rep, priority processing in 24 hours not 3 to 5 days, and, er, direct access to our coding team when updates happen so you'd never hit this problem again.

Customer [en]: Like, finally. Someone who actually understands.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah no I totally get it and—ooh wait I just got confirmation, all 47 claims are resubmitted with tracking numbers starting RCL-2200 through RCL-2246 and hmm, with platinum status I can actually flag these for tomorrow.

Customer [en]: Er, tomorrow? Not three days?

Customer Support [en]: Tomorrow! Already flagged them with priority code PRI-8845-PT and you'll get email confirmations as each one clears—ahh, plus I'm adding a note for our accounts team to call you about a service credit for this whole mess because honestly this shouldn't have happened.
