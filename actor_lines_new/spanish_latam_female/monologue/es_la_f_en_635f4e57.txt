=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Nobody else caught it. Three different departments reviewed that contract, legal signed off on it, and it was literally twenty minutes from being executed. [pause] I was just doing my usual Friday scan of next week's calendar when I noticed the dates didn't match up with the merger timeline we'd been working on for months. [curious] So I pulled the contract, and there it was—Section 14B, completely contradicting our non-compete agreements with our biggest client. We would've been in breach the second we signed it. [anxious] My hands were actually shaking when I called legal back. They thought I was overreacting at first. [frustrated] "It's already been approved," they said. But I kept pushing, kept explaining, and then... [relieved] then their lead counsel went completely silent on the phone. That's when I knew I was right. [proudly] Forty million dollars. That's what we would've lost, minimum, not even counting the lawsuits. [short pause] The CEO called me personally afterward. Said I saved the company. [quietly] But honestly? It's terrifying that it got that far. Like, what else are we missing, you know? [sigh] I've started triple-checking everything now. Can't help it. Sometimes being the only one who notices things is, um... it's exhausting. [trailing off] Really exhausting.
