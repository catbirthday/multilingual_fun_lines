Subject: Discovering your entertainment attorney mentor has been systematically stealing royalties from clients for decades

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [confused] Wait, this can't be right. I'm looking at these... these bank records and they're showing—no, that's impossible. [pause] Harold's been my mentor for what, fifteen years? There's gotta be some mistake here because these transfers, they're... oh god. [shaky voice] Twenty-three clients. Twenty-three separate accounts all routing through that shell company in Delaware. 

I trained under him. He taught me everything about, um... about protecting artists' rights. [angry] Jesus Christ, he literally wrote the book on royalty protection! How could he—I mean, we sat in his office drinking scotch while he lectured me about fiduciary duty and here he's been, what, skimming fifteen percent off the top for decades? 

[whispering] Mrs. Chen's retirement fund. That's where her song royalties went. [pause] She came to our office crying because she couldn't afford her husband's cancer treatment and Harold, he... he hugged her and said he'd look into it. [frustrated] God, I helped him draft that letter saying the label must have made an accounting error. 

My entire career is built on his teachings. Every contract I've ever written uses his, uh... his template language. [bitter] The language he designed to create these loopholes, apparently. How many people have I... oh no. [very quietly] How many of my own clients have these same provisions? [sad] I've been helping him. Without even knowing it, I've been helping him steal.
