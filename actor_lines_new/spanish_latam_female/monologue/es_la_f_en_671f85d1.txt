=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Embezzlement? Are you—are you serious right now? [confused] I don't even know what to say. [pause] Fifteen years. Fifteen years I've been here, and you think I'd just... what, steal from you? [angry] This is insane. I mean, I've worked weekends, holidays, I've—God, I missed my daughter's recital for that audit last month. [bitter] And now you're sitting here telling me that someone thinks I've been, what, cooking the books? [laughs] 

Um, okay. Let me get this straight. [slowly] You're telling me that after all this time, after everything I've done for this company, someone's decided that I'm a thief? [furious] Who? Who's saying this? Because I want to look them in the eye and—[pause] 

No, you know what? [exhausted] I can't even... I'm too tired for this. [sigh] I've given everything to this place. Everything. And this is what I get? Some anonymous tip or whatever and suddenly I'm, uh... I'm a criminal? [shaky voice] My kids go to school with the CEO's kids, for Christ's sake. [very quietly] I thought we were family here. [sad] I really thought that meant something.
