Subject: The financial counselor position you fought for is being eliminated because the hospital can't afford patient advocacy anymore

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [bitter] They're eliminating my position. [pause] After everything I did to convince them, que necesitábamos a alguien ayudando a los pacientes con sus deudas médicas, y ahora— [furious] lo están cortando todo, completamente. [sigh] "The hospital can't afford patient advocacy anymore." [sarcastic] Right, porque eso tiene mucho sentido, ¿no? [frustrated] A hospital that charges thirty dollars for an aspirin, pero no puede pagar a alguien que les explique a los pacientes por qué se están ahogando en facturas. [sad] I keep thinking about Mrs. Rodriguez, acaba de empezar la quimio y ya está atrasada con la hipoteca por los copagos. [pause] Who's going to help her now? ¿Quién se va a sentar con esta gente para explicarles sus opciones cuando les llegue esa factura de cinco cifras? [trailing off] The billing department sure won't... el departamento de cobros jamás lo hará. [very sad] I fought so hard for this position. [pause] Two years of proposals and presentations, mostrándoles los datos, los puntajes de satisfacción de los pacientes, este... las vidas que estábamos cambiando, de verdad. [crying while speaking] And they're just wiping it away, porque no genera ingresos. [bitter] Of course it doesn't generate revenue, ayuda a la gente a pagar su atención médica. [sniffle] Ese era todo el punto, ¿entiendes? [exhausted] I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now. [pause] Find another hospital, ¿supongo? ¿Uno que realmente le importe un carajo sus pacientes? [sarcastic] Good luck with that, sí, mucha suerte con eso. [very quietly] God, esto está tan jodido, Dios mío.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [bitter] They're eliminating my position. [pause] After everything I did to convince them we needed someone helping patients navigate their medical debt, they're just— [furious] they're cutting it entirely. [sigh] "The hospital can't afford patient advocacy anymore." [sarcastic] Right, because that makes perfect sense. [frustrated] A hospital that charges thirty dollars for an aspirin can't afford to have someone explain to patients why they're drowning in bills. [sad] I keep thinking about Mrs. Rodriguez, she just started chemo and she's already behind on her mortgage because of the copays. [pause] Who's going to help her now? [angry] Who's going to sit with these people and actually explain their options when they get that five-figure bill? [trailing off] The billing department sure won't... [very sad] I fought so hard for this position. [pause] Two years of proposals and presentations, showing them the data, the patient satisfaction scores, the, um... the actual lives we were changing. [crying while speaking] And they're just wiping it away because it doesn't generate revenue. [bitter] Of course it doesn't generate revenue, it helps people afford their care. [sniffle] That was the whole point. [exhausted] I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now. [pause] Find another hospital that actually gives a damn about their patients, I guess? [sarcastic] Good luck with that. [very quietly] God, this is so messed up.
