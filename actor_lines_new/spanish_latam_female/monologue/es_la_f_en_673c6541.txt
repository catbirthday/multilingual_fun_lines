=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] God, I can still feel it under my skin, the... the way everything just shifted. [exhausted] Three years. Three fucking years of people crossing the street when they see me, of losing my job because someone saw me change in the parking lot, of my own sister telling me not to come to Thanksgiving because it would "upset the kids." [bitter] And now... [long pause] 

That little girl, she was—Jesus, she was so small under that car. [very quietly] Nobody else could reach her. All those people just standing there, filming with their phones, waiting for the fire department, and she was screaming and I could smell the gasoline leaking and I just... I didn't even think about it, you know? [speeding up] The change just happened, faster than it ever has before, and suddenly I'm lifting this two-ton vehicle like it's nothing and pulling her out and she's holding onto my fur—my fucking fur—like I'm some kind of, I don't know, guardian angel or something. 

[warm] She wasn't afraid of me. [pause] Her mom was crying and calling me a hero and... [trailing off] 

[very sad] Maybe this curse is, um... maybe it's not just a curse. [sniffle] Maybe all that loneliness meant something. Maybe I was supposed to be there today. [relieved] God, she's okay. She's actually okay.
