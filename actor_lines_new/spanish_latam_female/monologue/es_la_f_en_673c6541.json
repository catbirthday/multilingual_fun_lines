[long pause] \n\nThat little girl, she was—Jesus, she was so small under that car. [very quietly] Nobody else could reach her. All those people just standing there, filming with their phones, waiting for the fire department, and she was screaming and I could smell the gasoline leaking and I just... I didn't even think about it, you know? [speeding up] The change just happened, faster than it ever has before, and suddenly I'm lifting this two-ton vehicle like it's nothing and pulling her out and she's holding onto my fur—my fucking fur—like I'm some kind of, I don't know, guardian angel or something. \n\n[warm] She wasn't afraid of me. [pause] Her mom was crying and calling me a hero and... [trailing off] \n\n[very sad] Maybe this curse is, um... maybe it's not just a curse. [sniffle] Maybe all that loneliness meant something. Maybe I was supposed to be there today. [relieved] God, she's okay. She's actually okay."
