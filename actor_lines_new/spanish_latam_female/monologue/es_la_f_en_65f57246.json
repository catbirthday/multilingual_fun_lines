And the security bots start lighting up everywhere, red eyes in the dark, so we're all running and sliding under these conveyor belts and—wait, why are you taking notes? [confused] This isn't for your school project, is it? Because I don't think Mrs. Henderson wants to hear about... \n\n[pause]\n\n[worried] Actually, you know what? Maybe we shouldn't—I mean, these stories are just, um... they're not really something you should be trying to copy or anything. Like when I told you about breaking into that warehouse, that was—that was wrong, okay? [regretful] Really wrong. People got hurt. I got hurt. Your mom almost left me because of all that stuff.\n\n[quietly] Sometimes I wonder if I should even be telling you any of this. But you keep asking about the scars, and the old crew calls sometimes, and I just... I don't know, I want you to know who I was, but I don't want you to think it was, uh, cool or something.
