=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Maya? Haven't seen you since what, three years ago at Tommy's wedding? You look like you've been carrying the whole world on your shoulders today.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, it's been forever, Sam. I just finished a rough shift at the tissue bank and needed something normal, something that doesn't involve sterile rooms and paperwork about people who aren't coming home.

Character 1 [en]: [concerned] The usual? Rocky road with extra marshmallows, the way you ordered it every Friday after school when we thought life's biggest problem was passing chemistry?

Character 2 [en]: [wistful] You remember that? God, those were simpler times. Today I processed tissue from a seventeen-year-old girl, same age as your sister was when she passed.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Sarah would have been twenty-eight next month. Sometimes when I'm scooping birthday cake flavor, I still think about the party we never got to throw for her eighteenth.

Character 2 [en]: [voice catching] This girl today, she had the same dark hair, same stubborn chin in her donor photo. Her corneas are going to help two people see, but all I could think about was how young she looked. [exhales]

Character 1 [en]: [gently] Here, let me make you a sundae the way we used to share them, back when we believed ice cream could fix anything that hurt.

Character 2 [en]: The family wrote a letter saying she wanted to be a nurse, wanted to help people heal, and now in a way she is, through what she left behind.

Character 1 [en]: [soft] That's the thing about giving, isn't it? Whether it's tissue that saves lives or ice cream that brings someone comfort on their worst day, we're all just trying to make things a little better. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: How do you do it, Sam? Stand here every day making people happy with something so simple when you know how complicated everything really is?

Character 1 [en]: [thoughtfully] Because complicated doesn't mean we stop trying to find sweetness. I learned that from Sarah, actually—she kept asking for strawberry ice cream even when she couldn't taste it anymore during chemo.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] Sometimes I wonder if I'm strong enough for this job, handling these gifts from people who won't get to finish their stories. [quieter] Today really got to me.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] You're doing work that matters, Maya. Every tissue sample you process, every family you help through the donation process, that's someone's second chance at life.

Character 2 [en]: It's just hard when they're so young, when they remind you of people you've lost, when you realize how fragile everything really is.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Remember what we used to say when Sarah was sick? That grief is just love with nowhere to go, so we put it into what we do.

Character 2 [en]: [understanding dawning] That's why you work here, isn't it? Not just scooping ice cream but creating these small moments of joy, the kind Sarah loved.

Character 1 [en]: [simply] Every cone I serve is a tiny celebration that we're still here, still trying, still believing that sweetness matters even when life is bitter.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Thank you, Sam.

Character 1 [en]: [lighter] Eat your sundae before it melts. And Maya? That seventeen-year-old's gift means someone else gets to order ice cream with their family for years to come. [gentle laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [finally smiling] You're right. Tomorrow I'll go back and process more donations, help more families, because that's how we honor them—by continuing the work. [peaceful sigh]
