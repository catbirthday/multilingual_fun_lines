=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [coldly] Acabo de pasar 20 minutos revisando lo que queda de mi cargamento de corcho premium, and I need to know exactly cómo chingados lograste destruir 30,000 euros de producto.

Character 2 [mix]: Mira, el manifiesto decía frágil, pero cada pinche caja que llega aquí dice frágil, y tenemos cuotas que cumplir, so we move things as efficiently as possible.

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter laugh] Eficientemente. ¿Así le llamas a aventar cajas marcadas 'Este Lado Arriba' de lado en el camión mientras los sellos de humedad se rompen?

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] Nadie me dijo que el corcho necesitaba manejo especial más allá del protocolo estándar de frágil, y honestamente, son solo tapones de botella, not crystal sculptures or something.

Character 1 [mix]: ¿Solo tapones? Esos corchos maduraron por 9 años en bosques portugueses, cosechados a mano de árboles más viejos que todo este complejo industrial. [exhales sharply]

Character 2 [mix]: [shifting uncomfortably] El supervisor del turno matutino dijo que teníamos que despejar el muelle antes del mediodía porque venía otro cargamento, so yeah, things got moved quickly.

Character 1 [mix]: Château Margaux ha sido nuestro cliente desde que mi abuelo empezó este negocio en 1952, y ahora tengo que llamarlos y explicar por qué su lanzamiento vintage no tendrá cierres adecuados.

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] Qué jodido.

Character 1 [mix]: ¿Sabes qué es jodido? Ver tres generaciones de artesanía aplastadas porque alguien no pudo leer una simple instrucción de manejo, or apparently didn't care enough to try.

Character 2 [mix]: [suddenly firm] Espérate, estás actuando como si yo personalmente decidiera destruir tu cargamento, but the real issue is that your packaging wasn't adequate for standard dock procedures. [pause]

Character 1 [mix]: [incredulous] ¿Procedimientos estándar del muelle?

Character 2 [mix]: Sí, si tu producto es tan delicado que el manejo normal lo arruina, maybe you should've paid for white glove service en lugar del flete básico. [shrugs]

Character 1 [mix]: Hemos estado enviando estos corchos exactamente de la misma manera por 40 años sin un solo incidente, until your crew got their hands on them. [seething]

Character 2 [mix]: [evasive] Mira, los accidentes pasan en logística, para eso existe el seguro, and I'm sure your company has coverage for this kind of thing.

Character 1 [mix]: [darkly amused] El seguro no restaura la reputación, no le explica a un maestro sommelier por qué su corcho se desmoronó en el Bordeaux del '85 que ha estado guardando por 20 años.

Character 2 [mix]: Okay, entiendo que estás molesta, pero quedarte aquí echándome culpas no va a arreglar mágicamente tus corchos ni cambiar lo que pasó esta mañana.

Character 1 [mix]: [leaning forward] No, pero tal vez lo pienses dos veces la próxima vez que veas 'Frágil: Productos de Corcho Natural', instead of treating it like another Amazon package to chuck around. [bitter exhale]

Character 2 [mix]: [muttering] Lo que sea, presenta tu queja con la gerencia si quieres, but I followed protocol, y eso es lo único que les importa a los que firman mis cheques. [walks away]

Character 1 [mix]: [calling after] Protocolo. Claro. Dime, cuando estés tomando vino barato con tapa de rosca porque nadie confía en los envíos, remember this conversation. [hollow laugh]

Character 2 [mix]: [from distance] Ni siquiera tomo vino, así que esa amenaza no me significa absolutamente nada, but good luck with your phone call to France.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [coldly] I just spent twenty minutes going through what's left of my premium cork shipment, and I need to know exactly how you managed to destroy thirty thousand euros worth of product.

Character 2: Look, the manifest said fragile, but every single box that comes through here says fragile, and we've got quotas to hit, so we move things as efficiently as possible.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Efficiently. That's what you call throwing boxes marked 'This Side Up' into the truck sideways while the moisture barriers split open?

Character 2: [defensive] Nobody told me cork needed special handling beyond the standard fragile protocol, and honestly, they're just bottle stoppers, not crystal sculptures or something.

Character 1: Just bottle stoppers? Those corks aged for nine years in Portuguese forests, harvested by hand from trees older than this entire industrial complex. [exhales sharply]

Character 2: [shifting uncomfortably] The morning shift supervisor said we had to clear the dock by noon because another shipment was coming in, so yeah, things got moved quickly.

Character 1: Château Margaux has been our client since my grandfather started this business in 1952, and now I have to call them and explain why their vintage release won't have proper closures.

Character 2: [quietly] That's rough.

Character 1: You know what's rough? Watching three generations of craftsmanship get crushed because someone couldn't read a simple handling instruction or apparently didn't care enough to try.

Character 2: [suddenly firm] Wait, you're acting like I personally decided to destroy your shipment, but the real issue is that your packaging wasn't adequate for standard dock procedures. [pause]

Character 1: [incredulous] Standard dock procedures?

Character 2: Yeah, if your product is so delicate that normal loading ruins it, maybe you should've paid for white glove service instead of basic freight. [shrugs]

Character 1: We've been shipping these corks the exact same way for forty years without a single incident until your crew got their hands on them. [seething]

Character 2: [evasive] Look, accidents happen in logistics, that's why insurance exists, and I'm sure your company has coverage for this kind of thing.

Character 1: [darkly amused] Insurance doesn't restore reputation, doesn't explain to a master sommelier why their cork crumbled into the '85 Bordeaux they've been saving for twenty years.

Character 2: Okay, I get it, you're upset, but standing here guilt-tripping me won't magically fix your corks or change what happened this morning.

Character 1: [leaning forward] No, but maybe you'll think twice next time you see 'Fragile: Natural Cork Products' instead of treating it like another Amazon package to chuck around. [bitter exhale]

Character 2: [muttering] Whatever, file your complaint with management if you want, but I followed protocol and that's all that matters to the people who sign my paychecks. [walks away]

Character 1: [calling after] Protocol. Right. Tell me, when you're drinking cheap screw-cap wine because nobody trusts shipping anymore, remember this conversation. [hollow laugh]

Character 2: [from distance] I don't drink wine anyway, so that threat means absolutely nothing to me, but good luck with your phone call to France.
