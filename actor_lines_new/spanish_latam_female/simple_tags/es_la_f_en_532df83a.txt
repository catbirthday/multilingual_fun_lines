=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] Give me your wallet, old man. [louder] Don't make this harder than it needs to be, I've got a knife and I'm not afraid to use it if you try anything stupid.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] Those coordinates on your wrist there, 41.7151 North, 70.2892 West. [pause] That's Cape Cod Bay, about three miles off Provincetown harbor, depth of maybe forty feet at low tide.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] What the hell are you talking about? [frustrated] I said give me your wallet, not some geography lesson, this isn't the time for games.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] July 15th, 2004.

Character 1 [en]: [angry] Stop talking in riddles! [exhales] Look, I don't want to hurt you but I need money and you're wasting my time with this nonsense about dates and coordinates.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Your mother had those coordinates tattooed after I pulled you from the water that day. [slowly] You were maybe six years old, swept out by a riptide while your family was having a picnic on the beach.

Character 1 [en]: That's impossible, you can't know that. [shaky voice] Nobody was there except the guy who saved me and my mom never told me his name.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] She was wearing a yellow sundress, screaming your name over and over. [pause] Michael, she kept screaming Michael, and when I brought you back to shore she couldn't stop crying and thanking me.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Oh god. [trembling] You're him, you're actually the person who saved my life and here I am twenty years later trying to rob you in an alley.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Life has a way of bringing people full circle, doesn't it? [sighs] I've navigated through forty years of ocean currents but never expected to cross paths with you again, especially not like this.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] You saved me for this? [crying while speaking] So I could grow up to become exactly the kind of person my mother was afraid I'd become after she died?

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Your mother passed? [quietly] Michael, she sent me a letter every year on July 15th, thanking me again, telling me how well you were doing in school, how proud she was.

Character 1 [en]: [upset] Cancer took her three years ago, right after I lost my job at the docks. [exhales] Everything just spiraled after that and now I'm holding a knife on the one person she'd never forgive me for hurting.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Put the knife away, son. [warmly] Let me buy you dinner instead of you taking my wallet, and we can talk about what your mother would really want for you now.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I can't accept charity from you, not after what I just tried to do. [sighs] You already saved me once and I can't be your burden again.

Character 2 [en]: [chuckles] It's not charity.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Then what would you call buying dinner for the guy who just tried to mug you? [quietly] Because from where I'm standing, that's either charity or insanity.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] I'd call it honoring your mother's memory and finishing what I started twenty years ago. [pause] Pulling someone from drowning means nothing if you let them sink again when you could help.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] I don't deserve this kindness. [shaky voice] But god, I'm so tired of drowning, so tired of feeling like that scared kid in the water except this time nobody's coming to save me.

Character 2 [en]: [very warmly] Somebody just did, Michael. [gently] The same somebody as before, only this time we're both a little older and the water's a different kind of deep.
