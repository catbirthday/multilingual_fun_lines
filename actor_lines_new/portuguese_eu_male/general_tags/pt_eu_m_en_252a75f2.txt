Scenario: An appliance repair technician arrives to fix a touring musician's broken refrigerator, only to discover it's their childhood best friend who's become famous while they stayed in their hometown.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The service order says penthouse unit, some fancy imported refrigerator that's—wait, [stunned pause], Jamie? Jamie Rodriguez from Franklin Street?

Character 2 [en]: [guarded] Hey, Marcus.

Character 1 [en]: [disbelieving] I saw you on the cover of Rolling Stone at the grocery checkout last week, and now you're standing here in your old Nirvana shirt like nothing's changed.

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] Everything's changed, actually, which is why I had to call for repair service instead of just asking you to come over like the old days.

Character 1 [en]: [hurt] You could have called me directly, you know, instead of going through the company dispatcher and pretending we're strangers. [quieter] I still have the same number.

Character 2 [en]: [uncomfortable laugh] I didn't know if you'd want to hear from me after I left without saying goodbye properly, just that stupid text from the airport.

Character 1 [en]: [working while talking] This compressor's completely shot, probably from being unplugged and replugged during your tours—these European models don't handle power fluctuations well.

Character 2 [en]: [wistful] Remember when we tried to fix your mom's freezer that summer after graduation and ended up flooding the entire garage?

Character 1 [en]: Yeah, except now I actually know what I'm doing, got certified and everything while you were learning to play stadiums. [pause] Your mom still asks about you at the hardware store.

Character 2 [en]: [softly] She does? I keep meaning to visit but the label has me scheduled every second, and when I do get home, I just hide up here.

Character 1 [en]: [focused on work] You're hiding in a three-million-dollar penthouse, Jamie—that's not exactly suffering in silence like we used to joke about.

Character 2 [en]: [pleading] Don't do that, don't make it about the money when you know that's not what matters between us.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] Right.

Character 2 [en]: [urgent] I tried to bring you with me, remember? Offered to hire you as my tech manager, but you said you didn't want to be anyone's charity case.

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] I'm good at what I do, Marcus who fixes things, not Marcus who follows his famous friend around carrying guitar cases.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] It wasn't charity, I needed someone I could trust, and now I'm surrounded by people who only see dollar signs when they look at me. [breaking slightly]

Character 1 [en]: [softer now] The compressor'll take three days to ship from Germany, but I can jerry-rig a temporary fix to keep your food cold until then.

Character 2 [en]: Three days? [hopeful pause] That means you'll have to come back, actually come back here to install it?

Character 1 [en]: [carefully neutral] That's the job, yeah, though usually I'd send one of the junior techs for the follow-up installation. [sighs] But I guess I can make an exception.

Character 2 [en]: Maybe we could get coffee after, like we used to at that place on Riverside—if it's still there, if you have time, if you want to.
