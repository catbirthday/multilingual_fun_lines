Scenario: A witness protection coordinator must inform a business partner that their longtime colleague and friend is being extracted in 48 hours due to testimony against organized crime.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [measured] Sr. Chen, preciso que compreenda que o David Krueger tem exatamente 48 horas antes da extração dele, and any contact you make with him after tonight could compromise his safety and yours.

Character 2 [mix]: Extração? O que é que tu—o David e eu construímos esta firma do nada ao longo de 15 anos, and you're telling me he's just disappearing? [voice rising] Isto tem de ser algum engano.

Character 1 [mix]: A família Mazetti descobriu a cooperação dele com as autoridades federais há três dias, which means every partnership document, every shared account, every business connection you have with him is now a potential liability.

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly devastated] Íamos anunciar a expansão para Singapura na próxima semana, o casamento da filha dele é em junho, e eu sou—Deus, eu sou o padrinho dela.

Character 1 [mix]: [softer] Lamento.

Character 2 [mix]: Lamentar não explica 17 anos de amizade à família dele, nem diz aos nossos 200 funcionários porque é que o CEO deles desapareceu, or help me understand how someone I trust with my life could be involved in something requiring witness protection.

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] O David tomou decisões para proteger provas que vão condenar 12 grandes figuras do crime, e essas decisões significam que ele nunca mais pode contactar ninguém da vida atual dele, including you.

Character 2 [mix]: Incluindo-me a mim. [bitter laugh]

Character 1 [mix]: Já há duas equipas de vigilância a observar o vosso edifício, and we intercepted communications suggesting they believe you might know where certain financial records are hidden.

Character 2 [mix]: Registos financeiros—Jesus, queres dizer as contas que o David insistiu em gerir pessoalmente, the ones he said were for tax efficiency in the Cayman structures?

Character 1 [mix]: Precisamos desses números de conta e de qualquer documentação a que consigas aceder, but more importantly, you need to act completely normal for the next two days while we extract him.

Character 2 [mix]: [desperately] Posso pelo menos dizer-lhe adeus, dizer-lhe que compreendo, that despite everything I don't hate him for this? Cinco minutos, é só o que peço.

Character 1 [mix]: [sharp exhale] Uma chamada telefónica, três minutos no máximo, deste telefone descartável, and you follow my script exactly with no deviations or personal messages. É o melhor que posso oferecer.

Character 2 [mix]: [voice cracking] Ele deu o nome da minha mãe à filha dele, sabias? Sarah Lin Krueger, porque ele dizia que as nossas famílias eram na verdade uma só família a construir algo juntos.

Character 1 [mix]: A partir de amanhã, vais ter de dizer a toda a gente que ele teve um colapso mental e desapareceu, which protects both his cover and your safety from anyone asking questions.

Character 2 [mix]: [steadying] E os documentos da fusão que precisam da assinatura dele, o processo pendente onde ele é a testemunha principal, the personal guarantee he gave on our expansion loan?

Character 1 [mix]: [accelerating pace] A nossa equipa forense vai tratar das assinaturas, the lawsuit will be settled quietly, e o empréstimo—vais ter de o reestruturar imediatamente usando o plano de sucessão de emergência no vosso acordo de parceria.

Character 2 [mix]: Já leste o nosso acordo de parceria, mapeaste toda a nossa estrutura corporativa, não foi? [exhales] Há quanto tempo é que nos andam a vigiar?

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] Mais tempo do que gostarias de saber, and I'm genuinely sorry that your friendship became collateral damage in something that started before you ever met him.

Character 2 [mix]: Antes de nos conhecermos—Cristo, alguma coisa foi real, or was our entire partnership just some elaborate cover story that I was too stupid to see through? [voice breaking]


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [measured] Ms. Chen, I need you to understand that David Krueger has exactly forty-eight hours before his extraction, and any contact you make with him after tonight could compromise his safety and yours.

Character 2: Extraction? What are you—David and I have built this firm from nothing over fifteen years, and you're telling me he's just disappearing? [voice rising] This has to be some kind of mistake.

Character 1: The Mazetti family discovered his cooperation with federal authorities three days ago, which means every partnership document, every shared account, every business connection you have with him is now a potential liability.

Character 2: [quietly devastated] We were supposed to announce the Singapore expansion next week, his daughter's wedding is in June, and I'm—God, I'm her maid of honor.

Character 1: [softer] I'm sorry.

Character 2: Sorry doesn't explain seventeen years of friendship to his family, or tell our two hundred employees why their CEO vanished, or help me understand how someone I trust with my life could be involved in something requiring witness protection.

Character 1: [firmly] David made choices to protect evidence that will convict twelve major crime figures, and those choices mean he can never contact anyone from his current life again, including you.

Character 2: Including me. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: There are already two surveillance teams watching your office building, and we intercepted communications suggesting they believe you might know where certain financial records are hidden.

Character 2: Financial records—Jesus, you mean the accounts David insisted on managing personally, the ones he said were for tax efficiency in the Cayman structures?

Character 1: We need those account numbers and any documentation you can access, but more importantly, you need to act completely normal for the next two days while we extract him.

Character 2: [desperately] Can I at least say goodbye, tell him that I understand, that despite everything I don't hate him for this? Five minutes, that's all I'm asking.

Character 1: [sharp exhale] One phone call, three minutes maximum, from this burner phone, and you follow my script exactly with no deviations or personal messages. That's the best I can offer.

Character 2: [voice cracking] He named his daughter after my mother, did you know that? Sarah Lin Krueger, because he said our families were really just one family building something together.

Character 1: After tomorrow, you'll need to tell everyone he had a mental breakdown and disappeared, which protects both his cover and your safety from anyone asking questions.

Character 2: [steadying] What about the merger documents that need his signature, the pending lawsuit where he's the primary witness, the personal guarantee he gave on our expansion loan?

Character 1: [accelerating pace] Our forensic team will handle the signatures, the lawsuit will be settled quietly, and the loan—you'll need to restructure that immediately using the emergency succession plan in your partnership agreement.

Character 2: You've already read our partnership agreement, mapped out our entire corporate structure, haven't you? [exhales] How long have you been watching us?

Character 1: [quietly] Longer than you'd want to know, and I'm genuinely sorry that your friendship became collateral damage in something that started before you ever met him.

Character 2: Before we met—Christ, was anything real, or was our entire partnership just some elaborate cover story that I was too stupid to see through? [voice breaking]
