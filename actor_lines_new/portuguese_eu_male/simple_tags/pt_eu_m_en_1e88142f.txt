=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] I never thought I'd be sitting here asking for this kind of help. [clears throat] Four years ago I was on magazine covers, and now I can't even afford my physical therapy sessions.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Mr. Davidson, there's no shame in needing assistance after what you've been through. [pause] Let's go through your income and expenses from the last six months to determine your eligibility bracket.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Income? My endorsement deals vanished the second my knee shattered on that landing. [shaky voice] The only money coming in is from coaching kids at the community center twice a week.

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] That's actually helpful information, and coaching income does qualify for our adjusted rate programs. Do you have documentation showing your medical expenses since the injury occurred?

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Documentation? I've got three boxes full of bills, denial letters from insurance, and receipts that add up to more than I made in my best year competing. [exhales] It's overwhelming.

Character 2 [en]: [patiently] I understand it feels like drowning in paperwork, but we'll sort through this together systematically. [firmly] Based on what you're describing, you'll likely qualify for our maximum assistance level, which covers eighty percent.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] Eighty percent still leaves me with thousands I don't have. [sighs] My parents keep offering to sell their house, but I can't let them sacrifice their retirement for my broken dreams.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] There are additional programs we can explore, including our catastrophic care fund for athletes injured during competition. [pause] Your case actually fits several criteria that could bring your responsibility down to nearly nothing.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Why didn't anyone mention these programs during my six previous hospital visits? [angry] I've been selling my medals and trophies on eBay to keep the collectors at bay while this existed?

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] Unfortunately, not all staff are trained on every assistance program we offer, which is a systemic problem we're addressing. [very sincerely] But I'm here now, and we're going to fix this retroactively if possible.

Character 1 [en]: [skeptical] Retroactively? You mean I might get back some of what I've already [voice breaking] scraped together by selling everything that meant something to me?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] With proper documentation, we can submit claims going back eighteen months for reimbursement. Let me pull up your account history and see exactly what we're working with here.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] I kept every receipt, even the parking garage tickets from appointments. [laughs bitterly] My coach always said attention to detail would serve me well, though I doubt he meant like this.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] That attention to detail is exactly what's going to help us now. [efficiently] I'm seeing multiple opportunities for refunds here, including several services that should have been covered initially under your athletic insurance.

Character 1 [en]: [exhausted] Can we really untangle all of this today? [sighs] I've got another appointment with the orthopedic surgeon in two hours that I'm already stressed about paying for.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] I'm canceling that copay requirement right now and backdating your assistance approval to cover it. See? [pause] The system's updating as we speak, so you can focus on healing, not billing.

Character 1 [en]: [emotional] You have no idea what this means. [shaky voice] I've been putting off surgery because I couldn't afford the rehabilitation afterward, just living with the pain and pretending I'm fine.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Mr. Davidson, you trained your whole life to push through pain, but this isn't a competition. [firmly] Let's schedule that surgery and get you the care you actually need, not just what you thought you could afford.

Character 1 [en]: [quietly] I keep thinking about the younger athletes who looked up to me, wondering if they know their hero can't even [chuckles sadly] walk without wincing anymore.

Character 2 [en]: [sincerely] Heroes aren't defined by their medals or their medical bills, and asking for help when you need it? [pause] That takes more courage than any triple axel ever could.
