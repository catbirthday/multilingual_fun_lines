=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Good afternoon. I need to resolve a billing error on my account immediately. I've been charged twice for the same subscription.

Customer Support [en]: Good afternoon, Professor. I'll be happy to help you resolve this billing issue right away. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your subscription?

Customer [en]: The email is j.martinez at university dot edu. This needs to be corrected today as I have expense reports due.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you, Professor Martinez. I've located your account ending in 7823, and I can see you have our Premium Academic subscription at $89.99 monthly. Let me review your recent transactions.

Customer [en]: That's correct. The duplicate charge appeared on October 15th. Both charges went through for the exact same amount.

Customer Support [en]: I see the issue clearly now. You were indeed charged twice on October 15th, both transactions for $89.99 with reference numbers TXN-4521-OCT and TXN-4522-OCT. This appears to be a processing error on our end.

Customer [en]: Exactly. How quickly can this be reversed? I need documentation for my department's accounting office.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I'm initiating the refund right now for the duplicate charge of $89.99, which will be credited under reference number REF-9845-JM. You should see this reflected within 2-3 business days.

Customer [en]: Can you send written confirmation of this correction today? My deadline is five o'clock.

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I'm generating an official refund confirmation letter with case number CS-102023-8745 that will be emailed to you within the next 15 minutes. It will include all transaction details and my direct extension.

Customer [en]: Perfect. Will this include the original charge date and both transaction numbers for my records?

Customer Support [en]: Yes, Professor Martinez. The documentation will show the October 15th charge date, both transaction numbers TXN-4521-OCT and TXN-4522-OCT, plus the refund authorization REF-9845-JM. Everything your accounting department requires.

Customer [en]: Good. And this won't affect my active subscription status or access to the premium features?

Customer Support [en]: Not at all. Your subscription remains fully active with all Premium Academic features intact. I've also added a note to your account to prevent any future duplicate billing issues.

Customer [en]: I appreciate that. Can you also confirm my next billing date so I can update my expense calendar?

Customer Support [en]: Of course. Your next billing date is November 15th, 2023, and I've verified that the automatic payment settings are now correctly configured for a single charge of $89.99 on that date.

Customer [en]: Excellent. Is there a direct number I can reach if there are any issues with the refund processing?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. You can reach me directly at extension 4412, or our priority support line at 800-555-7823. I've also assigned your case high priority status with tracking code PRI-8845-MART.

Customer [en]: Thank you for handling this efficiently. I'll watch for that confirmation email within fifteen minutes.

Customer Support [en]: You're very welcome, Professor Martinez. The email confirmation for case CS-102023-8745 is being prepared now and will arrive shortly from our billing department address at support@company.com. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
