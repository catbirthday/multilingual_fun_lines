=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I need to transfer my internet and cable service to my new address next month.

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. I'd be happy to assist you with your service transfer today. May I have your account number and the new address where you'd like to establish service?

Customer [en]: My account number is on autopay. The new address is 4782 Riverside Drive in Portland.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I've located your account ending in 3847. For 4782 Riverside Drive, Portland, Oregon 97205, I show that location is serviceable with our premium fiber package at speeds up to 940 Mbps.

Customer [en]: Perfect. I need the transfer completed by March fifteenth when I take possession of the property.

Customer Support [en]: I understand. Let me schedule your service transfer for March 15th. Our installation window would be between 8 AM and 12 PM, and we'll need someone over 18 present at the location for approximately 2 hours.

Customer [en]: That timeframe doesn't work. I have meetings that morning and can't take four hours off work.

Customer Support [en]: Of course. We have an afternoon slot available from 2 PM to 4 PM, or I can check March 16th which is a Saturday with more flexible scheduling options including an 8 AM precise appointment.

Customer [en]: The Saturday morning precise appointment would be ideal. What happens to my current service and equipment?

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. I've reserved Saturday, March 16th at 8 AM sharp for installation at 4782 Riverside Drive. Your current service at 921 Oak Street remains active through March 17th, giving you overlap for a smooth transition.

Customer [en]: I specifically need continuous service. My job requires zero downtime between the locations during this transition.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely understood. With the overlap I've configured, you'll maintain full connectivity. Your current modem model XB7-T can be transported to the new location, and our technician will have a backup unit QM9-2000 ready if needed for immediate setup.

Customer [en]: What about the early termination of my current address? I'm only six months into a two-year contract.

Customer Support [en]: Excellent question. Since you're transferring service within our coverage area to 4782 Riverside Drive, there are no early termination fees. Your existing 24-month agreement continues at the new location with 18 months remaining at your current rate of $89.99 monthly.

Customer [en]: Your website quoted me a higher rate for new service at that address. Can you clarify this discrepancy?

Customer Support [en]: I see the confusion. The website shows new customer pricing at $119.99 for that zip code 97205. However, as a service transfer, you retain your existing promotional rate of $89.99 through September 2025 when your current agreement ends.

Customer [en]: Good. I also need to confirm that my static IP address transfers with the service.

Customer Support [en]: Certainly. Your static IP ending in .241 will transfer with your business add-on package. The IP migration occurs automatically during the installation on March 16th, with zero configuration required on your end for connected devices.

Customer [en]: Excellent. Please email me written confirmation of everything we've discussed, including the pricing and March sixteenth appointment.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I'm sending a detailed confirmation to your email address on file right now with reference number TRN-48276-PDX. This includes your March 16th 8 AM appointment, continued $89.99 monthly rate, static IP retention, and overlap period through March 17th at your current location.
