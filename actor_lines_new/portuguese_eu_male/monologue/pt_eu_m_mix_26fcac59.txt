=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [exhausted] God, my hands are completely numb, de trabalhar naquela garagem gelada a tarde toda. [passionate] But you know what? Todas aquelas motas de neve estão a ronronar como gatinhos agora. [proudly] When search and rescue gets that call at three in the morning, quando alguém está perdido lá fora numa tempestade de neve, aquelas máquinas vão pegar. [very sincerely] They'll start every single time. É nisso que eu penso quando estou até aos cotovelos em massa lubrificante, ah, a menos 20 graus. [pause] [chuckle] My wife thinks I'm crazy—aos fins de semana a arranjar máquinas de borla. [warm] But she wasn't there last March, quando tirámos aquele miúdo da montanha. [emotional] Fourteen years old, em hipotermia, cheio de medo. [relieved] My machine—the one with the seized track I'd fixed the week before—foi essa que o trouxe para baixo. [quietly] His mom, ela, hum... ainda me manda postais de Natal. [laugh] Always with a photo of him doing something ridiculous—sempre a fazer disparates, skate, escalada. [very sincere] O miúdo agora não tem medo de nada. [confident] So yeah, I'll be back in that garage tomorrow, a certificar-me de que todas as correias estão apertadas, todas as velas limpas. [passionate] Because when that call comes—and it always comes—não podemos ter falhas mecânicas. [determined] Not on my watch.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [exhausted] God, my hands are completely numb from working in that freezing garage all afternoon. [passionate] But you know what? Every single one of those snowmobiles is purring like a kitten now. [proudly] When search and rescue gets that call at three in the morning, when someone's lost out there in a whiteout, those machines will start. [very sincerely] They'll start every single time. [pause] That's what I keep telling myself when I'm elbow-deep in engine grease at, uh, at minus twenty. [chuckle] My wife thinks I'm crazy—volunteering my weekends to fix machines for free. [warm] But she wasn't there last March when we pulled that kid off the mountain. [emotional] Fourteen years old, hypothermic, scared out of his mind. [relieved] My machine—the one with the seized track I'd fixed the week before—that's the one that got him down. [quietly] His mom, she, um... she still sends me Christmas cards. [laugh] Always with a photo of him doing something ridiculous—skateboarding, rock climbing. [very sincere] Kid's fearless now. [confident] So yeah, I'll be back in that garage tomorrow, making sure every belt is tight, every spark plug is clean. [passionate] Because when that call comes—and it always comes—we can't have mechanical failure. [determined] Not on my watch.
