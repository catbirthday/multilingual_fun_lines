Character 1 [en]: [angry] Could you please just tell me one more time exactly what happened to my package? I really need to understand where it went wrong here.

Character 2 [en]: [groan] According to the tracking system, it was delivered to your building at 2:47 PM yesterday, signed for by someone named Martinez. The driver took a photo showing it was left in what looks like your lobby area near the mailboxes.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, Martinez? Could you possibly check if there's any other information about this person? I don't know anyone by that name.

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I'm really sorry about this confusion—the signature just shows "M. Martinez" and nothing else. Sometimes neighbors sign for packages in apartment buildings, or it could have been a building manager or maintenance person who was there at the time.

Character 1 [en]: Would you be able to send me that photo the driver took? I need to see exactly where they left it.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely, I can email that to you right now. The photo shows a stack of packages near what looks like brass mailboxes, and yours is the brown box on top with the green shipping label—should be in your inbox in about thirty seconds.

Character 1 [en]: [confused] Sorry, um, could you help me understand why the driver would leave it there instead of, you know, actually attempting delivery to my door?

Character 2 [en]: [exhausted] The protocol for secured buildings is that if no one answers the apartment buzzer, drivers can leave packages in a designated safe area if one exists. Your building's listed as having a secure lobby with camera surveillance, so that counts as an approved drop-off location unfortunately.

Character 1 [en]: [short pause] Would it be possible for you to file a missing package claim on my behalf?

Character 2 [en]: I can definitely start that process for you right now. It'll trigger an investigation where we contact the driver directly, review any security footage we can access, and you should hear back within 48 to 72 hours maximum.

Character 1 [en]: Could you maybe also check if there have been other delivery issues reported at my building recently?

Character 2 [en]: Let me pull that up for you... actually yes, there have been three similar reports in the last month from your building. Seems like packages are going missing from that lobby area, which definitely helps support your claim here.

Character 1 [en]: I hate to ask, but would you be able to expedite the replacement shipment once this gets resolved?

Character 2 [en]: [cheerful] Oh absolutely, we'll upgrade you to overnight shipping at no charge once the claim goes through! Plus I'm adding a note that any future deliveries to your address require direct signature only—no more lobby drop-offs.

Character 1 [en]: Could you possibly email me a confirmation of everything we just discussed? I want to have documentation.

Character 2 [en]: Of course, I'm typing up a detailed summary right now with your case number, all the dates and times we discussed, and the steps we're taking. You'll have it in your email within the next five minutes along with that delivery photo.

Character 1 [en]: One more thing—would it be possible to speak with a supervisor about getting some kind of credit for this hassle?

Character 2 [en]: [groan] I actually am a supervisor, but look, given the circumstances and the pattern of issues at your building, I'm authorized to issue you a twenty-dollar credit right now. It'll appear on your account within 24 hours, and honestly, you deserve it after all this.

Character 1 [en]: Would you mind giving me your direct extension in case I need to follow up on this?

Character 2 [en]: Sure thing, I'm extension 4782, and my name's David Chen—I'm here Monday through Friday, 9 to 6 Eastern. Call me directly if you don't hear back about that investigation within those 72 hours I mentioned.
