Scenario: A man discovers that the centuries-old wrought iron fence surrounding an abandoned estate can speak, and it desperately tries to warn him about something buried beneath it while its consciousness fades in and out.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [rasping] Wait, don't step there—the ground beneath me isn't what it seems, hasn't been for decades since they put me here to guard it.

Character 2: What the hell?

Character 1: [fading] Listen. Please.

Character 2: [stepping back quickly] This isn't happening, fences don't talk, I must be having some kind of episode from the heat or something, maybe dehydration.

Character 1: My posts are rotting, my iron is rusting away piece by piece, [coughs metallically], but I need someone to know before I collapse completely—there are bodies down there.

Character 2: [nervously] Bodies? You're telling me there are actual bodies buried under this property and you've been, what, standing guard over them for how long exactly?

Character 1: [urgently] Since 1847, when the Blackwood family paid men to install me specifically here, right here, not three feet to the left or right but exactly here.

Character 2: Look, if this is real, if you're actually speaking to me right now, then I should call the police, not stand here talking to deteriorating metal. [pulls out phone]

Character 1: [panicking] No, no police, they won't understand—half my consciousness is already gone, eaten by rust, and when the last of my iron crumbles, the seal breaks.

Character 2: [lowering phone slowly] The seal? What kind of seal requires a fence to maintain it, and what exactly happens when this supposed seal breaks?

Character 1: They weren't just bodies, they were... [voice flickering] ...sorry, losing myself again... they were practitioners of something old, something that shouldn't have been brought here.

Character 2: Practitioners?

Character 1: [weakly] The iron keeps them dormant, but see that section near my third post? It's almost rusted through—maybe another week before that whole panel collapses. [trailing off]

Character 2: [incredulous] So you're telling me that in about a week, whatever these practitioners were doing back in 1847 is going to wake up because you're falling apart?

Character 1: Not wake up exactly, more like... spread. The ground here is poisoned with their attempts, their failed ritual, and I'm the only thing containing it. [creaking]

Character 2: [grimly] Then we need to replace you, reinforce you with new iron or something before you completely decay—I can get materials, workers, whatever you need.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] You think they haven't tried? Three different owners attempted repairs over the years, but the iron won't hold—it corrodes within hours of touching me now.

Character 2: There has to be something we can do besides just waiting for you to fall apart and release whatever nightmare is buried under there. [desperately]

Character 1: [fading rapidly] Find the Blackwood journals... the old library on Elm... they knew this would happen eventually and left instructions for... for... [silence]

Character 2: Hey! Come back! [shaking the fence] Don't you dare rust out on me now when you've just told me the world might end in a week!
