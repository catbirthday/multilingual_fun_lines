Scenario: A brother confronts his sister's best friend after discovering she's been secretly recording their family's private conversations to sell to tabloids.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [measured] So I found something interesting in my sister's room when I was helping her pack for tour—a voice recorder, tucked behind her jewelry box, still running.

Character 2: [innocently] Oh, that old thing? She probably uses it for songwriting ideas, you know how creative types are always trying to capture inspiration when it strikes.

Character 1: Funny thing is, when I played it back, it wasn't her voice doing the recording setup. [pause] It was yours, dated three weeks ago.

Character 2: [smoothly] She asked me to help her document the creative process for her documentary, thought it would be more authentic if someone else handled the technical stuff while she focused on being natural.

Character 1: Right, except the timestamp shows you turning it on after she left for her yoga class, and there's forty minutes of our mom talking about dad's rehab. [colder] Pretty weird documentary footage.

Character 2: Look, I can explain—sometimes I forget to turn things off, and honestly, your mom just started talking to me about personal stuff. [deflecting] I didn't want to be rude and interrupt.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] You know what else is interesting? That tabloid story last week about dad's gambling problem had exact quotes, word for word, from that recording.

Character 2: [still maintaining facade] That's just a coincidence, these gossip sites make up quotes all the time or maybe someone else in your family talked—I would never betray Emma's trust like that.

Character 1: Stop.

Character 2: [desperately polite] I understand you're protective of your sister, and that's admirable, but you're creating conspiracy theories where there's just a series of unfortunate misunderstandings that we can clear up.

Character 1: [wearily] I checked your Venmo—three payments from TMZ's parent company in the last month, each one day after a family story broke. [exhales] Just stop lying.

Character 2: Those were for freelance social media consulting work, completely separate from anything involving your family, and I have contracts to prove it if you'd like to see them.

Character 1: [defeated] You sat at our Christmas dinner, held my mom when she cried about the harassment, and told Emma you'd always protect her. My sister thinks you're family.

Character 2: [softer, almost genuine] Your sister means everything to me, and whatever you think happened, I need you to know that my feelings for her are real, completely real.

Character 1: I already told her—showed her everything, the recordings, the payments, the email drafts to gossip columnists you forgot to delete from the cloud account she shares with you.

Character 2: [mask slipping] She won't believe you over me, we've been through too much together, and she knows how overprotective you get about her career. [nervous laugh]

Character 1: [quietly resigned] She's in the car outside, waiting to hear what you say when you think she's not listening. [sighs] I told her you'd either confess or keep lying.

Character 2: [frantically polite] Wait, this is all a misunderstanding that's gotten completely out of hand—Emma, if you're listening, you know me, you know I would never intentionally hurt you or your family!

Character 1: She just texted me 'drive.' [hollowly] I think that says everything.

Character 2: [calling after] This is insane, you can't just destroy a four-year friendship over some circumstantial evidence and paranoid assumptions—Emma, please, let me explain everything properly!
