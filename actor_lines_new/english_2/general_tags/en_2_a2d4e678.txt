=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You found me faster than I expected—guess there's nowhere to hide when someone like you wants answers about what happened at the embassy.

Character 2: [measured] Twenty-seven nations are mobilizing their militaries based on incomplete intelligence, and you're the only person who saw what actually triggered that explosion.

Character 1: [defensive] I've already told three different agencies everything I know, but nobody seems interested in the part where your ambassador was meeting with someone who shouldn't have been there. [bitter laugh]

Character 2: [dangerously quiet] That meeting never happened, and suggesting otherwise could destabilize half of Eastern Europe—is that really the legacy you want to leave behind?

Character 1: Legacy? I'm a nobody.

Character 2: [leaning forward] Nobody is nobody when they hold information that could prevent a war, and right now you're carrying something that affects eight billion people.

Character 1: The man in the gray suit wasn't supposed to be there—I recognized him from the Zurich conference photos, the ones they said were doctored. [quieter]

Character 2: [carefully controlled] Those photos were examined by independent forensics teams from twelve countries, and they all confirmed digital manipulation—your memory might be playing tricks.

Character 1: [growing firmer] My memory is fine, and we both know why you're really here—it's not about preventing war, it's about controlling the narrative.

Character 2: [sharp exhale] Control the narrative or watch it spiral?

Character 1: There were two explosions, not one, and the first came from inside the secure wing where your people were stationed. [trembling]

Character 2: [ice cold] You're suggesting my organization orchestrated an attack on our own facility, which would be both treasonous and completely illogical given our investment there.

Character 1: I'm not suggesting anything—I'm telling you what I saw with my own eyes before your security team hustled me into that van.

Character 2: [suddenly softer] That van saved your life, and the people who sent it are the same ones trying to prevent this from escalating beyond anyone's control.

Character 1: [wistful] My grandmother survived the last world war by keeping her head down and her mouth shut—maybe I should have learned that lesson better.

Character 2: [urgently] We're offering you new identity papers, relocation to any country you choose, and enough resources to disappear completely—all we need is your silence.

Character 1: [hollow laugh] Disappear like the other witnesses from the embassy, the ones whose families are still asking questions that nobody will answer?

Character 2: Those people made choices that complicated their situations, but you still have the opportunity to walk away from this intact and protected. [pause]

Character 1: [resigned] Protected by the same people who might have caused this mess in the first place—that's the real joke here, isn't it? [sighs]

Character 2: [firmly] The only joke would be letting pride override survival when we're forty-eight hours from a conflict that nobody wins—your testimony changes nothing, but your silence saves everything. [final pause]
