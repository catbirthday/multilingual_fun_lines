=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Jesus, Maya, it's really you. I, uh, I've been telling everyone you're probably dead, that there's no way you'd survive six months out there, but here you are in this crappy motel looking like—well, looking alive. [nervous laugh]

Character 2: [defensive] Alive is, um, kind of a relative term when you can't use your real name or credit cards or, you know, exist in any meaningful way that the system recognizes.

Character 1: The department's still looking for you, obviously, but honestly the heat's died down since the commissioner resigned and, erm, I shouldn't even be telling you this but they're more focused on damage control than actually finding you.

Character 2: [bitter laugh] Damage control. That's what they're calling it when three cops are in federal custody and seventeen more are under investigation because I wore a wire for six months?

Character 1: [quietly] You could've come to me, Maya. Twenty years we were partners and you didn't think to, I don't know, give me a heads up that you were about to blow up our entire world?

Character 2: Oh come on, Danny, you knew something was wrong, you had to. The cash seizures that never made it to evidence, the dealers who mysteriously walked free—you're not that blind.

Character 1: [defensive] I kept my head down and did my job, which is what you're supposed to do when things get complicated, not, um, not run to the feds and burn everything to the ground.

Character 2: [sharply] Everything was already burning.

Character 1: [softer] Look, I didn't come here to argue about who was right or wrong, I just—when I heard you might be in town, I had to see for myself that you were okay.

Character 2: [warming slightly] How did you even find me? I've been so careful, changing locations every few days, paying cash for everything, avoiding cameras.

Character 1: [small smile in voice] You always get Thai food when you're stressed, and there's only one place in a fifty-mile radius that delivers after midnight—I taught you that trick, remember?

Character 2: [choking laugh] God, I'm an idiot.

Character 1: [gently] No, you're just human. And exhausted, from the looks of it. When's the last time you actually slept, like really slept without one eye open?

Character 2: I can't remember anymore, honestly. Maybe, um, maybe before all this started? Every noise could be them finding me, every knock could be—

Character 1: [carefully] What if I told you there might be a way back, not to the force obviously, but to having a life again, some kind of normal?

Character 2: [suspicious] Danny, what are you really doing here? Because if this is some attempt to bring me in, I swear I'll disappear so completely that—

Character 1: [urgently] I'm trying to help you, for Christ's sake! The prosecutor's office, they're willing to talk about witness protection if you testify, real protection, not this running and hiding bullshit.

Character 2: Protection from cops, administered by cops, for ratting out cops—yeah, that sounds super safe and not at all like a death sentence. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: [frustrated] Then what's your plan?

Character 2: [exhausted] I don't know, Danny. I really don't. Maybe I just keep running until I can't anymore, or until they stop caring, or until—[sighs] I don't know.
