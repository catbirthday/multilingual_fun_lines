Scenario: A trophy husband discovers his successful wife has hired a UX researcher to study and optimize their failing marriage like a product development problem.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] You're here to study what exactly? [pause] Miranda said you were coming by to help with some home project, but you just said you're a researcher who studies relationships.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Your wife hired me through my consultancy to analyze the dynamics of your relationship and provide recommendations for optimization. [clearing throat] She wants me to treat your marriage like a user experience problem.

Character 1: [bitter] Of course she does. [quietly] Everything in Miranda's world is a problem to solve, a system to optimize, a return on investment to maximize.

Character 2: [empathetically] I understand this must feel invasive, but she specifically requested someone who could approach this objectively without the emotional baggage that comes with traditional therapy.

Character 1: [defensively] So what, you're going to observe us like lab rats? [shaky voice] Take notes while we eat dinner, track our conversations, measure the quality of our interactions on some spreadsheet?

Character 2: [calmly] The process involves interviews, observation of natural interactions, and mapping pain points in your daily routines together. [sighs] Though I'll admit, this is the first time I've applied UX methodology to a marriage.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Pain points. [laughs] That's perfect—my entire existence in this marriage is apparently a pain point that needs debugging.

Character 2: [quickly] That's not what she said at all, she actually spoke very highly of you but mentioned feeling disconnected lately, like you're both using different operating systems.

Character 1: [frustrated] Different operating systems? [loudly] We're human beings, not software programs that need compatibility updates every time there's a glitch!

Character 2: [gently] You're right, the metaphor is imperfect, but sometimes looking at problems through a different lens can reveal solutions we wouldn't otherwise see. [pause] Your wife loves you but doesn't know how to reach you anymore.

Character 1: [very quietly] Maybe that's because she's always trying to fix me instead of just being with me. [sighs] I'm not broken code that needs debugging, I'm just lonely in my own home.

Character 2: [softly] I hear you.

Character 1: [anxiously] Do you know what it's like being the trophy husband everyone assumes is just arm candy? [speeding up] People look right through me at parties, only interested when they find out who I'm married to.

Character 2: [warmly] That sounds incredibly isolating, and honestly, it's something Miranda might not fully understand given how driven and connected she is in her professional world. [trailing off]

Character 1: [bitterly] She schedules our date nights like board meetings, sends calendar invites for intimacy, and now she's literally hired someone to optimize our relationship ROI. [laugh]

Character 2: [regretfully] This whole approach might be making things worse, I can see that now—treating human connection like a problem to solve rather than something to nurture.

Character 1: The irony is, I actually love her ambition and analytical mind, but somewhere along the way I became just another project to manage, another acquisition in her portfolio.

Character 2: [sincerely] What if instead of studying you both, I helped her understand that love isn't something you optimize—it's something you have to be present for, messy and inefficient as it is? [long pause]

Character 1: [hopefully] You'd do that? [very quietly] You'd tell her that her husband isn't a user experience problem but a person who just wants to feel seen by his wife? [pause]

Character 2: [confidently] I will.
