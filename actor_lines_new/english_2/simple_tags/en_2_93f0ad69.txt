Scenario: A popular underground DJ confronts someone who's been following them to every show and somehow found their home studio, discovering the person has recordings of their unreleased tracks.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [very quietly] How did you get in here? [pause] This is my private studio, nobody even knows this address except my label and my roommate.

Character 2: [excited] You always leave through the back exit at Warehouse 23, take the blue line three stops, then walk exactly seven blocks home. [quickly] I just wanted to hear the new tracks you've been working on.

Character 1: [anxious] That's incredibly specific information that you shouldn't have, and you definitely shouldn't be in my apartment right now.

Character 2: [passionately] But I'm your biggest supporter! [laughs] I've been to every single show for the past eighteen months, even the secret ones you only announce an hour before.

Character 1: [firmly] Being a fan doesn't give you the right to break into my home studio and go through my equipment. [pause] How long have you been sitting here in the dark?

Character 2: [cheerful] Only about three hours, wanted to surprise you when you got back from that meeting with the booking agent downtown. [sighs] Your new ambient track at 132 BPM is absolutely transcendent.

Character 1: You've been listening to my unreleased work? Those files are password protected and haven't been shared with anyone.

Character 2: Passwords are just obstacles for people who don't truly understand your artistic vision. [very sincerely] The way you layer those synths in the third breakdown, it's like you're speaking directly to me.

Character 1: [stern] I need you to leave immediately before I call the police, and I mean right now, not after we have some conversation you've been planning.

Character 2: [hurt] But I brought you that vintage Roland 303 you mentioned wanting in your interview with Electronic Beats last month! [quickly] It's in perfect condition, original packaging, everything.

Character 1: [confused] You bought me a ten thousand dollar synthesizer? [clearing throat] That's not normal fan behavior, you understand that, right?

Character 2: [fervently] Nothing about our connection is normal! [laughs] When you played that sunrise set at Desert Hearts, track seven at 5:47 AM, you looked right at me and smiled.

Character 1: [frustrated] I smile at lots of people during sets because I'm performing, it's part of connecting with the crowd, not a personal invitation.

Character 2: [overly polite] Of course you have to say that, I understand, public figures need plausible deniability about their real relationships. [whispers] But I have all our moments recorded, timestamped, catalogued.

Character 1: [very quietly] Recorded? [anxious] What exactly do you mean by recorded, and please be very specific about what you've been doing.

Character 2: [animated] Every set, every movement, every time you adjust the EQ or touch the crossfader! [excitedly] I have 847 hours of footage, multiple angles, some from spots you probably didn't even notice.

Character 1: This is stalking, what you're describing is literally stalking, and I'm calling 911 right now. [shaky voice] Please don't move.

Character 2: [calmly] The police won't understand that I'm just documenting your genius for posterity, preserving every moment of your artistic journey. [sighs] But I've already uploaded everything to multiple cloud servers anyway.

Character 1: [angry] You need serious help, professional help, and you need to delete everything you have of me immediately. This ends tonight.

Character 2: [whispering] It never ends when you're meant to be in someone's life forever. [pause] I'll leave for now, but we both know I'll be at your show tomorrow night, third row, left side, like always.
