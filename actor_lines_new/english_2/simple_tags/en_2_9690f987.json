            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[hesitantly] It's not about wanting to, it's about being smart. [sighs] Two people traveling together draws more attention than one, and after a score this big, we can't afford any mistakes."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[reluctantly] I guess that makes sense, even if I don't like it. [quietly] Just, uh, promise me we'll meet up again once things settle down, because doing this without you wouldn't mean much."
