=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Dad? What are you—no, this can't be happening. [very quietly] You're cleaning windows at my laboratory? The biosecurity level four facility where I've worked for eight years?

Character 2: [hesitantly] Sarah, I didn't know you worked here until I saw your name on the parking space this morning. [pause] I've been doing this route for six months now, never imagined I'd run into you like this.

Character 1: Don't call me Sarah.

Character 2: [apologetic] Right, of course, Dr. Mitchell then. [sighs] Look, I know this is uncomfortable but I'm just trying to make an honest living here, not cause any trouble for you or your work.

Character 1: [bitter] An honest living? That's rich coming from someone who emptied our college funds before disappearing. [coldly] Mom worked three jobs to put me through school after you left.

Character 2: [regretful] I know what I did was unforgivable, and I'm not asking for forgiveness. [quietly] But you should know I got clean seven years ago, been working steady ever since, trying to be someone different.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Congratulations on doing the bare minimum of being a functional human being. [exhales] Meanwhile, I spent twenty years wondering if you were even alive.

Character 2: [shaky voice] I wrote letters, hundreds of them over the years, but never had the courage to send them. [pause] Seeing what you've become, a scientist saving lives, maybe it's better I stayed away.

Character 1: [frustrated] You don't get to make that decision for me! [very quietly] Every graduation, every achievement, every breakthrough in my research, there was always this empty space where a father should have been.

Character 2: [gratefully] The security guard mentioned you're working on something important, something about antibiotic resistance that could help millions. [warmly] Your mother would be so proud of the woman you've become.

Character 1: [angrily] Don't you dare talk about her like you knew her! [voice shaking] She died two years ago, alone in a hospice while I was presenting at a conference because I thought work was more important than anything else, just like you did.

Character 2: [very quietly] She's gone? [long pause] I didn't know, Sarah—Dr. Mitchell, I'm so sorry. I thought maybe someday I could make things right with both of you.

Character 1: [withdrawing] There's nothing to make right anymore. [slowly] I need you to request a different building assignment because I can't have this distraction while handling deadly pathogens.

Character 2: [desperately] Please, this job is all I have right now, and the company won't reassign me without cause. [quickly] I'll work different hours, early mornings before you arrive, you'll never have to see me again.

Character 1: [exhausted] Fine, but if I see you here during regular hours even once, I'm filing a complaint with your supervisor. [pause] And don't try to leave any letters or messages for me.

Character 2: [sadly] I understand completely, and I'll respect your boundaries. [sighs] But can I ask just one thing? Are you happy? Despite everything, did you find some happiness in your life?

Character 1: [coldly] That's none of your business.

Character 2: [warmly] You're right, it's not. [pause] But seeing you here, knowing you're doing something that matters, helping people—that's enough for me to know the answer.

Character 1: [firmly] I have samples that need processing and a team meeting in twenty minutes. [quietly] This conversation is over, and as far as I'm concerned, this meeting never happened.

Character 2: [gratefully] Thank you for not calling security immediately, that's more grace than I deserved. [very quietly] I'll be gone before sunrise tomorrow, and every day after that, just like you asked.
