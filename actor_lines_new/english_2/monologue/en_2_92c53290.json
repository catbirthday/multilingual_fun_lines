[frustrated] And they kept saying \"Stop being so negative, stop questioning everything.\" [pause] Mom actually called me paranoid. [bitter] \"Why can't you just trust people for once?\" she said. Well, I don't know, maybe because something felt... off? The whole thing with the investment returns being guaranteed, and the guy calling himself a \"wealth advisor\" but, hmm, couldn't answer basic questions about licenses. [anxious] I kept asking to see documentation and everyone got so annoyed with me. [mocking] \"There you go again, always looking for problems.\" [sigh] But I just—I couldn't shake this feeling, you know? Something about how he kept pushing for immediate transfers. [very sincerely] And thank God I pushed back because Dad finally agreed to wait one day, just one day, to verify. [gasp loudly] That's when we found out the whole company doesn't even exist! [shaky voice] We were literally hours away from losing everything. Mom's retirement, Dad's savings... [pause] Now suddenly I'm the hero. [chuckle] Same skepticism that drives them crazy at every restaurant, every contractor quote, every—well, everything. [warm] But this time? This time it saved us."
