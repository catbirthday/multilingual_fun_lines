=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] Twenty thousand units of insulin stuck in customs and we've got hospitals running out in twelve hours. Okay, okay, think. [pause] The manifest says priority medical but they're treating it like regular cargo—that's not going to work. [frustrated] I told them three times yesterday this was critical! 

Wait, wait, what if we, um... what if we split the shipment? [quickly] Pull half through the express lane with diplomatic clearance—I know someone at the embassy who owes me. The other half, we can reroute through the military base, they have medical exemptions. [sigh] 

God, the paperwork alone is going to be... [trailing off] No, forget the paperwork, we'll figure that out later. [passionately] People need this medicine NOW. 

[confidently] Alright, I'm calling Captain Morrison at the base. He'll understand. And Sarah at customs—she's worked emergencies before. [short pause] We can make this happen. We have to make this happen. These aren't just boxes, they're, uh... they're someone's kid who needs their insulin tonight. [determined] Someone's grandmother who can't wait until morning.

[relieved] Yeah, this is going to work. Six hours to get everything moving, another three for transport. [exhales] We'll beat the deadline by three hours. That's enough. That has to be enough.
