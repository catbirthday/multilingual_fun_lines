Subject: Realizing you've been reading meters wrong for years and hundreds of families got overcharged

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Wait, this can't be right. I'm looking at these readings and they're... oh God. [pause] The decimal point. I've been—no no no, this isn't happening. [anxious] Every single meter for the past, what, three years? I've been putting the decimal in the wrong place? [gasp] That means all those families have been paying ten times what they should've been. 

Hundreds of households. [very quietly] Oh my God, hundreds of them.

[shaky voice] Mrs. Rodriguez kept saying her bills seemed high but I just... I told her usage goes up in winter. And the Johnsons, they—[sigh] they had to take out a loan. Because of me. Because I didn't know how to read a damn meter properly.

[upset] How did nobody catch this? I mean, shouldn't someone have noticed? Three years of overcharging and I'm just now seeing it because I decided to double-check one reading? 

[crying while speaking] All those people who trusted us, who trusted me to do my job right, and I've been bleeding them dry. Some of them probably couldn't afford groceries because of this. Because of my mistake.

[very sad] I have to tell my supervisor. Right now. This is... this is going to destroy everything.
