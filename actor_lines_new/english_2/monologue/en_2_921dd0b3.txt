=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] Twenty-three dollars here, forty-seven there, eighteen... God, it goes back to March. March! That's eight months of— [pause] I keep checking the numbers because maybe I'm reading this wrong? But no, it's all there in the spreadsheet, every single discrepancy ties back to Sarah's shifts. [very sad] Sarah. My Sarah. The one who helped me move three times, who stayed with me through the divorce, who— [sigh] I mean, we've been friends since college. That's twelve years.

[hesitantly] I don't understand why she didn't just ask me for help. [frustrated] Like, if she needed money that badly, I would've— I would've figured something out! We could've worked out a loan or, I don't know, adjusted her hours or something. [quietly] But stealing? From the business we built together? 

[angry] The worst part is she looked me in the eye yesterday and complained about our margins being down! She actually suggested we cut back on employee bonuses while she was, um... while she was literally taking money from the register. [crying while speaking] How do I even bring this up? "Hey bestie, noticed you've stolen about two thousand dollars from us?" [bitter] God, what a conversation that'll be.
