Twenty million people who almost had their lives turned upside down. [relieved] And we stopped it. I mean, I stopped it. [pause] By firing Marcus. [bitter] My best friend since college, the guy who was in my wedding, who helped me move three times, who— [voice breaking] who I had to escort out of the building with security yesterday. [angry] Because he was careless. Because he clicked on that phishing email even after all the training, all the warnings. And then tried to cover it up for two days while they were already in our system. [frustrated] Two days! [pause] I keep thinking about his face when I told him. Like I'd, um... like I'd betrayed him somehow. [sad] Maybe I did. But what was I supposed to do? Let the board find out I knew and didn't act? Risk everyone's data because of friendship? [sigh] The worst part is he still doesn't get it. Texted me this morning saying I chose the job over him. [very quietly] And he's right. [long pause] I did. And I'd do it again. [crying while speaking] Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt like hell though."
