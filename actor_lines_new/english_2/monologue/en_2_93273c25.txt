=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Fifteen years. Fifteen years I've been coming in early, staying late, missing my kid's soccer games for quarterly reports. And they think I— they actually think I stole from them? [pause] I keep replaying that meeting in my head. The way they looked at me, like I was already guilty. Like everything I'd done just... disappeared. [angry] I've never taken so much as a paperclip home without asking! I turned down job offers to stay loyal to this place. [voice breaking] And Sarah from HR, she couldn't even look me in the eye. We've had lunch together every Friday for five years. [bitter] Now suddenly I'm what, some criminal mastermind who's been plotting this whole time? The numbers they're talking about— I don't even have access to those accounts. I'm in marketing, for God's sake. [desperate] But nobody's listening. They've already made up their minds. They see missing money and they see... I don't know, the guy who drives a ten-year-old Honda must need it? [sigh] My daughter's starting college next year. If I lose this job over something I didn't do— [trailing off] I can't even... [determined] No. No, I'm getting a lawyer. They want to destroy my reputation? Fine. But I'm not going down without a fight. Not after everything I've given them.
