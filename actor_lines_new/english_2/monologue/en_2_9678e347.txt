Subject: Your stepbrother calling to say your support helped him get through his divorce

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [surprised] Oh my God, Jake just called. I haven't heard from him in, what, three weeks? [pause] He sounded so different. [warm] Like the real him again, you know? Not that hollow version I've been talking to for months. [sigh] He actually thanked me. Said I was the only one who didn't pick sides when everything went down with Sarah. [short pause] Which is funny because I definitely had opinions. [chuckle] I just kept them to myself. [sincerely] But hearing him say that my support meant something... God, I didn't realize how worried I've been. [relieved] He's going to therapy now. Actually going, not just saying he will. And he's, um... he's even talking about maybe dating again eventually. [laugh] Not soon, but like, the fact that he can even imagine it? [trailing off] That's huge... [pause] I remember when Dad married his mom and suddenly I had this older brother who wanted nothing to do with me. [empathetically] Now he's calling me first with the good news. [very quietly] Maybe something good came out of all this mess after all. [sniffle] I should probably call him back and actually say some of this stuff instead of just stammering "you're welcome" like an idiot.
