Subject: Your compositing artist work being completely redone because the client said it "lacks vision and technical skill"

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] Lacks vision and technical skill. That's what they said. About MY work. [pause] Three weeks I spent on those shots—three weeks of rotoscoping every single frame, matching the lighting perfectly, and they just... they're redoing everything. [angry] Not tweaking it, not asking for revisions—completely starting over because apparently I don't know what I'm doing. [sigh] Eight years in this industry and suddenly I'm, what, incompetent? [frustrated] The director loved it last week! He literally said it was exactly what he wanted, and now the client comes in and suddenly it's amateur hour? [very quietly] Maybe I should've seen this coming. They've been weird since that meeting. [upset] But "lacks vision"—that's just... that's personal. That's not feedback, that's an insult. [shaky voice] I keep thinking about all those late nights, missing dinner with my family because I was perfecting the edge work, and for what? [pause] You know what the worst part is? Part of me is, um... part of me is wondering if they're right. [angry] No. No, that's stupid. My work is good. [confidently] I've won awards for this stuff. [trailing off] But then why does this hurt so much...
