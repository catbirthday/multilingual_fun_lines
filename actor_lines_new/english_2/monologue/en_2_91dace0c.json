I just—I just did the math and it's been eight months of this \"learning opportunity\" and I haven't... hmm, I haven't learned anything new since month two. [pause] They keep saying, you know, \"just a little longer\" and \"we're figuring out the budget\" but that's what they said in, um... in March. And April. [angry] And May and June and July. [sigh] Oh my God, I'm such an idiot. They're never going to hire me, are they? [bitter] \"Great experience for your resume,\" they said. Yeah, great experience doing actual employee work for zero dollars while they, uh, while they keep stringing me along with vague promises about \"when a position opens up.\" [furious] I've been doing Sarah's job for three months! She left, and instead of hiring someone, they just... gave me her responsibilities. [shaky voice] As a learning opportunity. God, I can't even pay my student loans. My parents keep asking if it's leading somewhere and I keep saying, er, I keep saying yes because I actually believed it. [very sad] But there's no path here. There never was. [sarcastic] I'm just free labor with a fancy title. [exhausted] Eight months of my life. Eight months."
