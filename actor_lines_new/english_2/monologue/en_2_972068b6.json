And honestly, I was starting to think there was no way out for either company. [pause] But then I looked at the synergies differently. \n\nSee, TechVault's bleeding cash, right? Their burn rate is, um... it's catastrophic. [anxiously] Four months left, maybe five if they're lucky. And DataSync—they've got the infrastructure but zero innovation pipeline. Completely stalled. [short pause] But here's the thing—and this is where it gets really interesting—their weaknesses are perfectly complementary.\n\nTechVault's R&D team could plug directly into DataSync's distribution channels. No redundancies. Well, minimal redundancies. [confidently] The combined entity would save, hmm, forty-two million in the first year alone just from eliminating duplicate operations. \n\nAnd the debt restructuring! [laugh] God, I can't believe the banks missed this. If they merge before Q3, they can renegotiate both credit facilities as a single entity. That's, uh... that's another eighteen months of runway right there. [relieved] \n\nThe board meetings are gonna be rough, sure. Cultural integration, leadership conflicts, all that. [trailing off] But mathematically... [passionately] mathematically this saves them both. It's not just survival—they could actually thrive."
