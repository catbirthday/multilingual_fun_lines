=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Wait, you're telling me you counted cards at the Bellagio?

Character 2: Not exactly counting in the traditional sense. I was tracking patterns in the dealer's shuffling habits and exploiting a flaw in their automatic shuffler. Completely legal, but they still asked me to leave after I turned two hundred into eight thousand.

Character 1: [formal] How does one even learn such techniques?

Character 2: Started with YouTube videos actually, then moved to probability theory textbooks. The real education came from playing thousands of hands online where you can track statistics in real-time without casino security breathing down your neck.

Character 1: They actually kick you out for being too good?

Character 2: Absolutely. Casinos have the right to refuse service to anyone, and if you're consistently beating the house edge, you're bad for business. They'll politely escort you out and add your face to their database.

Character 1: What's the dumbest bet you've ever seen someone make?

Character 2: [whispering loudly] Guy next to me once put five grand on double zero at roulette three times in a row. Lost it all. The odds of hitting that specific number are thirty-seven to one, and he just kept doubling down like physics would bend for him.

Character 1: Jesus, that's rent money for months.

Character 2: That's the thing about casino psychology—they design everything to make you forget real value. Chips don't feel like money, the lights and sounds trigger dopamine, and there's no clocks or windows so time becomes meaningless.

Character 1: You still go to casinos after knowing all this?

Character 2: Only for poker now, since you're playing against other people, not the house. The casino just takes a rake from each pot, so skill actually matters long-term unlike pure chance games.

Character 1: Ever get in trouble with those poker players?

Character 2: [frustrated] Had a guy threaten me in the parking lot once because I called his bluff with jack-high. He'd been pushing people around all night, and when I finally stood up to him, he lost his mind.

Character 1: [pause] Did you report him or anything?

Character 2: [playful] Security was already watching him apparently. They love poker drama—keeps the other tables full of gawkers ordering drinks. He got himself banned before I could even file a complaint.

Character 1: What's your biggest win ever?

Character 2: Twelve thousand in a single poker tournament. Took fourteen hours of play, and by the end I was running on pure adrenaline and terrible casino coffee.

Character 1: Holy shit, what'd you do with the money?

Character 2: [cough] Paid off my car loan and invested the rest in index funds. The boring answer, but gambling winnings only feel good until you blow them on something stupid.
