=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Do you actually play fantasy football?

Character 2: Oh yeah, I've been, uhh, completely hooked for like six years now. Started with just one league with coworkers but now I'm in, hmm, four different ones? It's basically taken over my Sundays, which my partner finds both amusing and slightly concerning.

Character 1: Four leagues? How do you even manage that?

Character 2: Honestly? Spreadsheets and, er, way too much time on Reddit. The trick is having different draft strategies for each one—like, I'll go running back heavy in one, then literally do zero-RB in another just to, you know, hedge my bets.

Character 1: What's zero-RB?

Character 2: Right, so it's this strategy where you basically ignore running backs early and just, ummm, load up on elite receivers and a top quarterback instead. The idea is that RBs get injured so often you can usually find decent ones on waivers, but truly elite wideouts are, like, impossible to replace.

Character 1: Does that actually work?

Character 2: Mmm, sometimes? I mean, I won a championship with it two years ago, but last season was, oof, brutal. Grabbed all these supposedly "league-winning" waiver pickups who just completely busted.

Character 1: Who was your biggest bust?

Character 2: Ugh, don't even get me started on drafting Calvin Ridley in the second round last year. Thought I was so smart getting him "at value" and then he, well, literally didn't score a single touchdown until Week 11.

Character 1: Ouch. What about daily fantasy?

Character 2: Oh man, DFS is a whole different beast—it's basically, uhh, legalized gambling with a spreadsheet. I dabble occasionally but those sharks who use optimizer tools and enter like 150 lineups? Can't really compete with that, you know?

Character 1: [cough] Sorry, what are optimizer tools?

Character 2: They're these programs that crunch all the statistics and, er, spit out optimal lineups based on projections and salary caps. Some people literally have algorithms running thousands of simulations to find the perfect combination—it's pretty much turned into, hmm, quantitative trading for sports nerds.

Character 1: Is it even fun at that point?

Character 2: Right? Like, where's the gut feeling, the random hunch about your sleeper pick? Though I guess for some people the, ummm, the data analysis IS the fun part—different strokes and all that.

Character 1: [mumbling] I drafted a kicker in the third round once.

Character 2: [confidently] Okay, that's actually hilarious and I respect the chaos of it. Was this your first draft or were you just, like, asserting dominance? Because honestly, taking Justin Tucker that early is such a power move.

Character 1: [furious] It was an accident! I clicked the wrong button!

Character 2: [laugh loudly] Oh my god, that's even better! The, ahh, the panic you must have felt when you realized! Did your league mates absolutely roast you, or did you somehow spin it as strategy?
