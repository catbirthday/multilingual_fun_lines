Character 1: So what's the damage looking like for the kitchen?

Character 2: We're looking at about twelve thousand for the full remodel, maybe thirteen if you want the upgraded countertops. That includes new cabinets, the tile backsplash you picked out, and complete rewiring for the pendant lights.

Character 1: Thirteen thousand. Cool, cool.

Character 2: [sneeze] Excuse me. The demo alone is going to take three days because of that load-bearing wall situation we discussed. Can't just sledgehammer through it like they do on TV.

Character 1: [sigh] And the timeline is still two months?

Character 2: Two months is realistic, yeah. I know it sounds long but between permits, inspections, and waiting for the custom cabinets to arrive from the manufacturer, that's actually pretty aggressive.

Character 1: What if we skip the fancy cabinets?

Character 2: Stock cabinets would save you about three weeks and two grand. They're not terrible quality either—I've installed plenty from Home Depot that look fantastic once they're properly mounted and finished.

Character 1: My wife really wants those specific ones though.

Character 2: Then we stick with the custom order. Happy wife, happy life, right? Plus those soft-close drawers she picked are genuinely worth the extra money in my professional opinion.

Character 1: You married?

Character 2: Twenty-three years next month. My wife's actually the one who got me into contracting—her dad owned a construction company and I started working for him right out of high school.

Character 1: That's a long time.

Character 2: It goes by fast when you're building something together. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you want to do with that bathroom adjacent to the kitchen?

Character 1: [over confidently] Oh that bathroom's perfect as is.

Character 2: [very loudly] You're kidding me! That toilet rocks when you sit on it and the vanity is literally held up with a two-by-four! I noticed when I was measuring the kitchen walls!

Character 1: Alright alright, what would that cost?

Character 2: [extremely happy] Now we're talking! For another four thousand I can gut that whole space and give you something actually functional! New fixtures, proper tile work, maybe even a rainfall showerhead if you're feeling fancy!

Character 1: Seventeen thousand total then.

Character 2: Seventeen thousand for a kitchen and bathroom that'll add thirty thousand to your home value. You literally cannot lose on this deal, and I'll throw in fixing that wonky front door latch for free.
