=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So. Um. I think there's been. Sort of a mix-up? With the—no wait. The reimburse—er, reimbursement.

Customer Support: Okay okay, I can definitely help you with that. Let me just—just pull up your account here real quick. Can you give me your order number or maybe the email associated with your account?

Customer: Right. Yes. I have it. Somewhere. Oh! It's, uh, probably ORD. Then some numbers. Er, 4429? No that's—sorry, 4492.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect, ORD-4492-BK7, I've got it right here. So I can see there was a purchase on November 3rd for $287.50, and it looks like—like there's a pending reimbursement request. What exactly happened with this order?

Customer: The frames. Museum frames. They came wrong. All wrong. Um, completely. Different size than what I, er, what we ordered.

Customer Support: Oh that's—that's frustrating, especially for museum displays. So you ordered specific frames and received the wrong size entirely? Let me check the specs here... yeah I see you ordered the 24x36 archival frames, product code MF-2436-A, but what did you actually receive?

Customer: Small ones. Maybe, um, twelve by—no. Sixteen? I think sixteen by twenty. Kind of useless for the Rothko prints.

Customer Support: Rothko prints in the wrong frames, that's—that's definitely not going to work. So here's what I can do, I'm seeing you initiated a return on November 8th, tracking number RMA-7792-X, but it looks like the refund got stuck in processing. Let me just—just get that moving for you right now.

Customer: Wait but. That's not. Er, we sent them back already. Two weeks ago. Sort of. Maybe ten days? Oh God, the opening's tomorrow.

Customer Support: Oh no no, the opening's tomorrow? Okay so—so we need to get this sorted immediately. I can see the return was delivered to our warehouse on November 15th, that's confirmed, but somehow the refund just—just didn't trigger automatically. I'm processing it manually right now, you'll see $287.50 back within 2-3 hours.

Customer: Hours? Not days? Because, um, I need to buy new frames. Today. Actually by noon probably. Er, definitely by noon.

Customer Support: Absolutely absolutely, I'm marking this as priority code P1-URGENT so it processes within the hour, not 2-3 hours. And listen, since this was our error and you have an opening tomorrow, I'm also adding a $50.00 courtesy credit to help with the rush shipping on new frames.

Customer: Oh! That's. Huh. That's actually quite nice. Sort of saves the day. Um, mostly. Still have to rehang everything.

Customer Support: I can imagine that's—that's a lot of work, especially last minute. The refund plus credit, so $337.50 total, will hit your account by, let me check the exact time... 11:47 AM your time. Will that give you enough time to order the replacement frames?

Customer: Should do. Yes. Probably. If the, er, if the frame shop has them. They usually do. Um, thank you. Really.

Customer Support: You're so welcome! And hey, what's the exhibition? I'm—I'm actually kind of curious about the Rothko prints you mentioned.

Customer: Oh! Color fields. 1968 series. Er, the meditation ones? People just. Sort of. Stand and stare. Quite moving actually.

Customer Support: That sounds—sounds amazing actually. Those meditation pieces really do just pull you in. I hope the new frames arrive in time and the opening goes perfectly. Your confirmation number for this whole transaction is REF-8847-QM2, and you should get an email any minute now.

Customer: Right. Good. Yes. Um, fingers crossed then. About the frames. Not about Rothko. He's sorted.

Customer Support: Ha, yes yes, Rothko's definitely sorted! If anything goes wrong with that refund, just reference case number CS-1122-RK9 and anyone here can help immediately. Best of luck with the opening tomorrow!
