=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look, I got charged twice for the same feed order. Need this fixed.

Customer Support: Oh no, double charge. Let me pull that up. So what's your account number?

Customer: It's, uh... 4-7-2-8-9. March delivery.

Customer Support: Got it, account 47289. So basically I'm seeing two charges here on March 14th, both for $1,847.22. That's definitely not right. Let me check what happened with order FD-3847-ML.

Customer: Exactly. Same amount. Same day. I need one reversed today.

Customer Support: Absolutely. So here's what I'm doing right now. Processing refund for that duplicate charge, reference number RFN-9923-XK. Should hit your account in 2-3 business days.

Customer: Three days? I got payroll Friday. Need it faster.

Customer Support: Okay okay. Let me escalate this. So basically I'm marking this as priority expedited, case number PRI-6621. That cuts it to 24 hours max. We're going to fix this.

Customer: That works. This happen to other accounts?

Customer Support: So checking our system alerts... yeah, looks like batch 3847 had a processing glitch. Hit about 12 customers total. We caught most but yours slipped through.

Customer: Course it did. What about my next order? Due April 3rd.

Customer Support: So your April order, FD-4102-ML, that's all set. Single charge only, scheduled for delivery April 3rd to your location at 8827 County Road. And hey, I'm adding a credit for the hassle.

Customer: Credit? How much we talking?

Customer Support: So basically I'm applying $75 to your account right now. Credit code CRD-7734-AP. Plus I'm putting a note that you're priority customer status for the next 6 months.

Customer: Alright. That's... that's fair. But next time this happens, I'm switching suppliers.

Customer Support: Totally understand. So I'm personally flagging your account 47289 for manual review on all future charges. Nothing processes without human verification.

Customer: Good. And I want confirmation when that refund hits.

Customer Support: Already set. So you'll get email and text confirmation to the number ending in 3847 as soon as refund RFN-9923-XK processes. Like I'll personally make sure it goes through tomorrow.

Customer: Fine. Guess we're square then. For now.

Customer Support: We are. And so basically if anything feels off with future orders, you call and ask for me directly. Extension 4421. I've got your back on this.
