=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I purchased a dishwasher from you thirteen months ago, and it just stopped working completely.

Customer Support: Good afternoon, and thank you for contacting us. I understand how frustrating that must be, especially with the timing. Let me pull up your account information and review the warranty details for model DW-5500-XL.

Customer: Yes, that's the correct model. The warranty expired exactly one month ago, which seems remarkably convenient.

Customer Support: I completely understand your concern about the timing. Looking at your purchase from October 23rd, 2023, I can see the standard twelve-month warranty did expire on October 23rd, 2024. Let me check what options we have available for you.

Customer: I'd appreciate that. This is a premium appliance that should last longer than thirteen months.

Customer Support: Absolutely right.

Customer: What exactly went wrong with it? The control panel is completely dead.

Customer Support: That does sound like it could be an electrical issue with the main control board, part number CB-5500-A7. While the standard warranty has expired, I can offer you our extended service option at a 40 percent discount, bringing the repair cost down to $180 instead of the standard $300.

Customer: That's still quite expensive for a product that just barely outlasted its warranty.

Customer Support: I understand completely, and I agree this shouldn't happen with a premium product. Let me escalate this to our customer retention team at extension 4502. They have additional authorization for situations like yours where the failure occurs so close to warranty expiration.

Customer: Thank you. How long will that take?

Customer Support: One moment please.

Customer: I'm still here. Should I expect a callback or will you transfer me?

Customer Support: I apologize for the brief hold. I've just received approval from our retention manager, case number RT-2024-11-8829. We can offer you a one-time courtesy repair at no charge, given that the failure occurred within 30 days of warranty expiration.

Customer: That's much more reasonable. Thank you for escalating this appropriately.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. I'm scheduling a technician visit for Tuesday, November 12th between 2 PM and 4 PM. They'll bring the replacement control board CB-5500-A7 and any other parts that might be needed.

Customer: Tuesday afternoon works perfectly. Will I receive a confirmation?

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: Excellent. I appreciate you finding a fair resolution to this issue.

Customer Support: It's my pleasure, and thank you for your patience and for being a valued customer. You'll receive an email confirmation within 15 minutes to your registered address, and our technician will call you at 555-0147 thirty minutes before arrival on Tuesday.
