=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: I almost walked right past it. Can you believe that? [excited] This dingy little frame, covered in dust, sitting behind a stack of amateur watercolors. But the brushwork—God, the brushwork caught my eye immediately. [quickly] My hands were actually shaking when I picked it up. Twenty-five dollars, the tag said. Twenty-five! [gasp softly] And I'm standing there thinking, this can't be real, this absolutely cannot be what I think it is. [anxious] But the signature, the technique, that specific shade of ochre he always used in his early period—everything was screaming at me that this was genuine. [pause] I had to play it so cool at checkout. Just threw it in with some other junk so they wouldn't notice. [whispering loudly] "Oh these old paintings, yeah, they'll look nice in my guest room." Meanwhile my heart's about to explode! [animated] I've been doing this for fifteen years and you dream about a find like this but it never actually happens. Except it did. [very quietly] It actually happened to me. [nervous] Now I just have to figure out, um... how to authenticate it without the estate realizing what they had. Because if word gets out before I secure it properly— [trailing off] God, I can't even think about that.
