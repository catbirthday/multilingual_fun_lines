Subject: The plastics plant efficiency improvement you designed reducing environmental impact by forty percent

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Forty percent. I keep saying it out loud because it still doesn't feel real. [excited] When I first pitched the redesign, they thought I was being way too ambitious. [chuckle] And honestly? Part of me thought they were right. I mean, the whole system was—it was basically held together with duct tape and good intentions. 

[hesitantly] But then I started mapping out the inefficiencies, and um... there were so many redundancies. The cooling loops alone were wasting, what, thirty thousand gallons a day? [frustrated] Nobody had looked at it holistically in twenty years! So I'm sitting there with these spreadsheets at 2 AM, and I realize, wait—if we just reconfigure the entire flow pattern... [trailing off]

[very sincerely] You know what gets me though? It's not even the award or whatever. It's thinking about all that plastic we're still making, but now it's... I don't know, less horrible? [pause] My daughter asked me if I'm saving the planet. [sad] And I had to tell her, no sweetie, I'm just making it worse a little more slowly. 

[relieved] But forty percent is something, right? That's real carbon, real waste that's not happening. [smiling speaking] Maybe that's enough for today.
