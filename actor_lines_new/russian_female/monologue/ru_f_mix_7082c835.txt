=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [exhausted] God, that meeting was... intense. [sigh] Я не могу поверить, что эта незнакомка просто подошла ко мне после и сказала это про мой подход. [surprised] Like, she actually noticed? [pause] Она сказала, что я была, эм... какое точно слово она использовала? Collaborative. [warm] Yeah, she said I kept bringing people back together, когда всё накалялось. [laugh softly] I mean, I was just trying to keep everyone from, знаешь, совсем не сорваться там внутри. [hesitantly] But hearing that from someone I don't even know... [trailing off] не знаю, это... [emotional] это правда много значит. [sniffle] Sorry, I'm just—вау. [relieved] Я так переживала, что я слишком, э, настойчивая? Или может наоборот, недостаточно настойчивая? [anxiously] You know how these neighborhood meetings can get, особенно когда речь идёт о новой застройке и у всех свои... свои интересы. [clearing throat] But she said—this complete stranger said—что я помогла людям реально услышать друг друга. [very sincerely] Maybe I'm not as bad at this as I thought. [chuckle] Боже, мне так нужно было это услышать сегодня. [happily] Like, really needed it.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [exhausted] God, that meeting was... intense. [sigh] I can't believe that stranger just came up to me afterwards and said that about my approach. [surprised] Like, she actually noticed? [pause] She said I was, um... what was the exact word she used? Collaborative. [warm] Yeah, she said I kept bringing people back together when things got heated. [laugh softly] I mean, I was just trying to keep everyone from, you know, completely losing it in there. [hesitantly] But hearing that from someone I don't even know... [trailing off] I don't know, it's... [emotional] it actually means a lot. [sniffle] Sorry, I'm just—wow. [relieved] I've been so worried that I was being too, er, pushy? Or maybe not pushy enough? [anxiously] You know how these neighborhood meetings can get, especially when we're talking about the new development and everyone's got their... their stakes in it. [clearing throat] But she said—this complete stranger said—that I helped people actually hear each other. [very sincerely] Maybe I'm not as bad at this as I thought. [chuckle] God, I really needed to hear that today. [happily] Like, really needed it.
