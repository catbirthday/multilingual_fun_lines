=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [hesitantly] So I got the promotion today. The one that... well, technically it's Michael's old position. [pause] God, it feels so weird sitting in his office. I mean, they already cleared out all his stuff but I can still see where his family photos left those little marks on the desk. [sad] He taught me everything, you know? Like, literally everything I know about forensic accounting came from him. And now I'm just... here. [sigh] In his chair. Making probably twice what he was making before they, um... before they restructured. [guilty voice] That's what they're calling it - restructuring. [bitter] Twenty-three years he gave them and they just... [pause] I don't know, maybe I should've said something when they offered it to me? But then again, what was I supposed to do - turn it down? Someone else would've just taken it. [conflicted] And honestly? I'm good at this. Really good. Michael always said I had the instinct for it. [very quietly] I just wish he could see me now. [long pause] Actually, no. Maybe it's better he can't.
