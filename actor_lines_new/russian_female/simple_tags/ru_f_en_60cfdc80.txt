Scenario: A banshee appears at a marine park after hours, drawn by the impending death of an elderly whale the trainer has cared for since childhood.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] I don't usually appear to the living like this, but, um, the water here is calling with such sorrow that I couldn't stay in the veil. [pause] Your whale, the ancient one—she's preparing her final song.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] Wait, what are you—how did you even get in here? [anxious] The park's been closed for hours and I'm the only one with clearance to be in the medical pools after midnight.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] Locks and walls mean nothing to creatures like me, and honestly, I'm not here to harm you or anything. [sighs] I came because Grandmother—that's what you call her, isn't it?—her spirit is, well, it's loosening from her body.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky voice] Grandmother's been sick for months but the vets said she was stable, that we had more time to, uh, figure out treatment options. [quietly] You're telling me she's dying tonight?

Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] Death doesn't follow veterinary schedules, and marine mammals, they know when it's time better than most creatures. She's been hiding her pain from you because, mmm, she loves you too much to cause you grief.

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] She can't hide anything from me.

Character 1 [en]: Oh, but she has been, for weeks now, swimming her patterns perfectly during the day and then, at night when you leave, she floats in the corner barely breathing. [very quietly] I've been watching, waiting.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] I've been her trainer for twenty-three years, since I was nineteen and she was just a calf, and you're saying I missed all these signs? [exhales] That's not possible, I know every sound she makes, every movement.

Character 1 [en]: [gently] That's exactly why she could hide it.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] So what, you appear to everyone when their, um, when their loved ones are about to die? [pause] Is this some kind of twisted courtesy call from the afterlife or whatever you call it?

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Usually I only keen for humans, but she's different, she's touched so many human lives that the boundary gets, er, complicated. [trailing off] And you—your grief is already so loud it pulled me across dimensions...

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] I'm not grieving yet because she's not dead, she's right there in that pool, and maybe if you'd stop talking about death and actually help— [chokes up] There has to be something we can do.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] There is something, actually, and it's why I revealed myself instead of just, you know, waiting in the shadows. She wants to hear your voice one more time, not as her trainer but as her family.

Character 2 [en]: [whispering] I sing to her every morning before the park opens, old sailing songs my grandfather taught me, and she always does this little spiral dance when I hit the high notes. [sighs] Should I go to her now?

Character 1 [en]: [softly] Sing the one about returning home.

Character 2 [en]: [confused] How could you possibly know about that song? [slowly] I've never sung it when anyone else was around, it's just something between me and her, our secret morning ritual.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] The dying hear everything that matters to them, every memory, every song, and sometimes, well, creatures like me hear it too. [gently] It's beautiful, by the way, especially the part where you change the words to include her name.

Character 2 [en]: [tearfully] If I go sing to her now and she, um, if she lets go while I'm there, I don't think I can handle watching her leave. [exhales] But I can't let her go alone either, can I?

Character 1 [en]: No one should cross over alone, and honestly, she's been waiting for you to be ready to say goodbye, holding on despite the pain. [very quietly] Your voice will be her bridge.

Character 2 [en]: [relieved] Then I'll sing until she doesn't need me anymore, and maybe, uh, maybe you could stay too? [pause] I know it's weird asking Death's messenger to keep me company, but I think I need someone who understands this kind of ending.
