=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Of course my check is short. Fifty bucks missing. Because why would anything just...

Customer Support [en]: Okay. Let me—actually wait. I need your employee ID first. To pull up. The payroll records.

Customer [en]: Hmm, let me see here... It's EMP-7742. Or 7243. No wait, 7742.

Customer Support [en]: Got it. So I'm looking at—hold on. Your last pay period. December 1st through 15th. Shows $1,247.50 gross. But net is—er, that's odd actually.

Customer [en]: Let me guess. Something's wrong with the system. And there's nothing you can...

Customer Support [en]: No no. I see it. There's a—hmm. Deduction code DC-50-UNIF. Fifty dollars. For uniform. But that's—let me check something else real quick.

Customer [en]: Uniform? What uniform? We wear our own clothes. This is ridiculous.

Customer Support [en]: Right. So. I think—no actually I know what happened. Someone applied. The wrong deduction category. Should've been UC-00-NONE. For your position. Code 3847. Horse groom. No uniform requirement.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... what exactly? Can you fix it or...?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I'm submitting—well first. Let me document this. Incident number INC-2024-8923. For the correction. Should process. Within 24 to 48 hours probably.

Customer [en]: Twenty-four to forty-eight. Great. My rent was due yesterday.

Customer Support [en]: Oh. Eesh. Okay so—actually wait. I might be able to. Let me try something. If I flag it as. Payroll error priority. Code PEP-1.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if that doesn't work though? I mean, I need this money...

Customer Support [en]: It'll work. I'm putting—er, basically. Your case reference. PR-8923-URGENT. Direct to. The payroll supervisor's queue. They process these. Same day usually. By 4 PM Eastern.

Customer [en]: Oh. Okay so... today? Like actually today? Not corporate "today" meaning next week?

Customer Support [en]: Today today. Real today. The supervisor—I can see. She's actually. Online right now. Username PSUP-Martinez. Already has. Three corrections pending. Yours makes four.

Customer [en]: Alright. I guess that's... better than I expected. What happens if it doesn't though?

Customer Support [en]: Then you call back. Reference this incident. INC-2024-8923. And ask for—well actually. Ask for me. Agent A-7625. I'll escalate it. To regional payroll directly.

Customer [en]: Okay. Yeah. Thanks. I'll check my account later then...

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. You should get. An email confirmation too. From payroll@company.org. Within the hour. With your correction amount. Fifty dollars exactly. Plus the processing confirmation.
