=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Um, so I work there. At the hospital. Why'm I payin' for parking?

Customer Support [en]: Oh I see—let me just—actually, let me pull up your account here. What's the employee ID number showing on your parking pass?

Customer [en]: It's, er... wait. Eight-seven-two. No, that's my badge. Hold on.

Customer Support [en]: That's okay, take your time. Let me see here... I can actually search by—hmm, what if we try your license plate instead? That should be linked to your account since 01/15/2024.

Customer [en]: Ohio plate. Uh, JPF-4. Wait. Four-J-P-F. That's it.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect, okay so that's—oh wait, I see what happened. Your chaplain parking exemption code CHE-2024-847 expired on 10/31, and the system's been charging you the visitor rate of $18 per day since then.

Customer [en]: Visitor rate? Um. I'm there ev'ry day. For patients. That's my job.

Customer Support [en]: I know, I completely understand—that must be so frustrating. So what I'm going to—actually, let me make sure this doesn't happen again. I'll reactivate your exemption right now, backdated to 11/01/2024.

Customer [en]: Er, yeah but. Who's payin' me back? That's... that's a lotta money.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, you're getting every penny back. Let me calculate—hmm, so from November first through today, that's... okay, $468 in charges that'll be credited to your account within 3-5 business days.

Customer [en]: Four sixty-eight? Uh. Wow. I just. Nobody told me it expired, y'know?

Customer Support [en]: Oh that's—I'm really sorry, the notification system should've—wait, let me check something. Looks like the email went to your old address ending in @mercy.org instead of your current one.

Customer [en]: Mercy? That's. Um. That was three years ago. Before here.

Customer Support [en]: Right right. So I'm updating—no wait, actually I'm going to set up text alerts too, to your number ending in 7829. That way you'll get notified thirty days before any future expiration.

Customer [en]: Um, good. Yeah. It's just. Death certificates. Grief counseling. Then this. Er, sorry.

Customer Support [en]: No no, please don't apologize—you're doing such important work. Actually, let me also—hmm, I'm adding a note here that you're essential staff so if this ever happens again, any rep can immediately override charges with code ESS-OVERRIDE-2024.

Customer [en]: Essential staff. Huh. Okay. So. So it's fixed then?

Customer Support [en]: Completely fixed. Your new exemption code CLE-2025-122 is active through 12/31/2025, and like I said, that refund of $468 will hit your account soon. Is there anything else about the parking I can help with?

Customer [en]: Er, no. Wait. The gate. Sometimes won't open. Just sits there.

Customer Support [en]: Ooh okay, so that's—hmm, that's usually when the sensor doesn't read properly. But since I've got you here, I'm scheduling maintenance to check gate B7 tomorrow at 2:30 PM. Meanwhile, if it happens again, press the call button and give them reference number MAINT-94521.
