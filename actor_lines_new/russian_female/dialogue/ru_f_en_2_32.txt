Character 1 [en]: Are you okay? That looked like it hurt.

Character 2 [en]: I'm fine, just caught the tip on my shoulder. The padding absorbed most of it, though I have to say fencing is quite different from navigating underwater currents—at least down there you have three dimensions to work with.

Character 1 [en]: [sarcastic] Right, because swimming with sharks is so much safer than this.

Character 2 [en]: Actually, sharks are incredibly predictable once you understand their behavior patterns. Most species avoid humans entirely, whereas here your opponent is actively trying to strike you with a metal blade.

Character 1 [en]: [stuttering] I-I didn't mean to hit you that hard, I just got caught up in the moment.

Character 2 [en]: No need to apologize—that was a clean hit and exactly what you're supposed to do. In diving we say commit to your decisions fully, and you did exactly that with your lunge.

Character 1 [en]: You keep comparing everything to diving.

Character 2 [en]: Force of habit from twenty years of instruction. The principles translate surprisingly well though—controlled breathing, spatial awareness, staying calm under pressure. Both sports demand complete focus on your environment.

Character 1 [en]: How did you even end up here?

Character 2 [en]: My doctor recommended something for cardio during the off-season when the water's too cold. Figured sword fighting would be more interesting than a treadmill, and honestly the footwork reminds me of moving across a boat deck in rough seas.

Character 1 [en]: Do you miss being underwater?

Character 2 [en]: Every single day. There's nothing quite like that weightless silence forty feet down, watching sunlight filter through the water like cathedral windows. But this has its own rhythm, its own kind of meditation.

Character 1 [en]: [cough] Want to go another round?

Character 2 [en]: [playful] Absolutely, but this time I won't go easy on you. Fair warning—I've been studying your patterns and you drop your guard every time you retreat from a failed attack.

Character 1 [en]: [friendly] Hey, thanks for the tip! Most people here just try to win.

Character 2 [en]: Teaching is in my blood whether it's dive techniques or fencing footwork. Besides, you've got natural timing that most beginners lack—you just need to trust your instincts more and stop overthinking every movement.

Character 1 [en]: Is that what you tell your diving students?

Character 2 [en]: [gasp] Oh absolutely! Overthinking underwater can be dangerous—you burn through oxygen faster when you're anxious. Same principle here actually, tension makes you slower and your reactions become predictable when you're stuck in your head.

Character 1 [en]: Ready when you are then.

Character 2 [en]: En garde! Remember to keep your weight centered and watch my shoulder, not my blade. The shoulder always telegraphs the attack before the hand moves, just like watching for the subtle shift before a current changes direction.
