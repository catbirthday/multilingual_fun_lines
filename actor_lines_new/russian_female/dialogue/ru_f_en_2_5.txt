Character 1 [en]: Wait, wait, did you just see that? That person who walked by, they looked at me weird, right? Did I do something wrong?

Character 2 [en]: Oh, hmm, I didn't really notice anything unusual about how they looked at you, but, you know, sometimes people just have expressions on their faces that have nothing to do with us—like maybe they were thinking about their grocery list or, uh, remembering something embarrassing from last week.

Character 1 [en]: But what if they know something about me? What if everyone's been talking about that thing I said at the meeting?

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] Okay, so here's what I think is happening—you're doing that thing where your brain takes one tiny moment and, mmm, basically builds this whole narrative around it, which is super common actually, especially when we're already feeling a bit anxious about something else that's going on.

Character 1 [en]: I counted seventeen times people avoided eye contact with me today. Seventeen! That can't be normal.

Character 2 [en]: Whoa, you're actually counting? That's, um, that's a lot of mental energy you're spending on tracking other people's eye movements, and honestly, most people avoid eye contact because they're in their own heads or, like, checking their phones or just trying to get through their day without social interaction.

Character 1 [en]: But what if I smell bad? I changed deodorants yesterday. Oh god, what if everyone can smell me?

Character 2 [en]: Look, I can tell you right now that you smell completely fine, like totally normal, but I get it—when anxiety kicks in, our brains start looking for evidence that something's wrong, and, uh, suddenly every little thing becomes potential proof of disaster, even though logically we know that's probably not what's happening.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Do you think I should go home and change? I have three backup shirts in my car.

Character 2 [en]: [passionately] No! No, see this is exactly what feeds the anxiety cycle—you give in to the compulsion to fix a problem that doesn't actually exist, and then your brain learns that the anxiety was justified, which just makes it worse next time, and I really, really think you should try to sit with this discomfort instead!

Character 1 [en]: Three backup shirts isn't weird, is it? My therapist said it was "interesting" when I mentioned it.

Character 2 [en]: Ah, well, "interesting" is kind of therapist-speak for "let's explore this more," isn't it? And look, having backup shirts isn't inherently weird, but, um, it might be worth thinking about whether that's helping you feel more secure or actually reinforcing the idea that catastrophe is always just around the corner.

Character 1 [en]: I also have backup socks, pants, two phone chargers, hand sanitizer, three types of pain relievers, and emergency snacks. Just in case.

Character 2 [en]: [yawn] Sorry, not bored, just—it's been a long day, but yeah, that's quite the emergency kit you've got there, and while being prepared is good, there's this line where preparation becomes, uh, almost like a security blanket that paradoxically makes you feel less secure because you're constantly anticipating disasters.

Character 1 [en]: What if my therapist is secretly taking notes about how crazy I am? She writes a lot during our sessions.

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, okay, so therapists definitely take notes, but it's literally just to remember what you talked about for next time, not like "patient is bonkers" or whatever you're imagining—they're probably writing boring stuff like "discussed anxiety about social situations" or, um, "explore relationship with preparedness next session."

Character 1 [en]: Do you think people can tell when I'm spiraling like this? Can they see it on my face?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? Most people are way too wrapped up in their own stuff to notice, like, they're worrying about their own appearance or their own problems, and even if someone did notice you seemed anxious, they'd probably just think "oh, they're having a rough day" and, uh, forget about it two minutes later because that's how human attention works.

Character 1 [en]: I made a spreadsheet of all my social interactions this week to look for patterns. Want to see it?

Character 2 [en]: Geez, a spreadsheet? That's, mmm, that's actually kind of impressive in terms of dedication, but here's the thing—analyzing your social interactions like data points is probably making you more anxious, not less, because you're treating human connection like a problem to solve instead of just, you know, letting yourself exist as a imperfect person among other imperfect people who are all just trying their best.
