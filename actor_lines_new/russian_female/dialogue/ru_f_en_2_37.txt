Character 1 [en]: So I heard you spent $400 on a vampire facial last week. Did they use actual vampire blood or just pretend?

Character 2 [en]: [mumbling] Oh god, it's not—it's called platelet-rich plasma therapy, okay? They, um, they basically take your own blood and spin it in a centrifuge to extract the growth factors, which honestly sounds way weirder when I explain it out loud like this.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, so you paid someone to stab you with your own blood? That's the most expensive self-harm I've ever heard of!

Character 2 [en]: Ugh, no, it's actually really scientific—the micro-needling creates these, like, controlled injuries that trigger collagen production, and then the PRP, which has, mmm, concentrated healing factors, it accelerates the whole regeneration process by basically 40% compared to regular micro-needling alone.

Character 1 [en]: Did you also get that snail slime treatment? I bet you're the type who lets garden pests crawl on your face.

Character 2 [en]: Okay, first of all, snail mucin is, erhm, incredibly rich in hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid, which are both proven anti-aging ingredients, and second, they don't actually put live snails on your face anymore—that's so 2013—they use purified secretion filtrate now.

Character 1 [en]: [cry] Oh no! They don't use live snails anymore? How will you bond with your slimy friends?

Character 2 [en]: You're being ridiculous, but actually, um, the Korean beauty industry has done, like, fifteen years of research on gastropod secretions and they've found it reduces scarring by up to 30% in clinical trials, so joke all you want but the science is pretty solid here.

Character 1 [en]: Next you'll tell me you're injecting bee venom into your lips or something equally insane.

Character 2 [en]: [very sad] I mean, bee venom therapy is actually... it's a real thing that stimulates collagen and elastin production through, uh, controlled inflammation responses, though I haven't personally tried it because I'm, well, terrified of anything bee-related honestly.

Character 1 [en]: Have you considered just aging gracefully instead of turning yourself into a science experiment?

Character 2 [en]: Oh wow, that's—look, preventative skincare isn't about not aging, it's about, mmm, maintaining healthy skin barrier function and preventing unnecessary damage from, you know, environmental stressors and free radicals which literally everyone is exposed to every single day regardless of vanity levels.

Character 1 [en]: Environmental stressors? You mean like the stress of explaining why you need gold-infused face masks?

Character 2 [en]: Ha, okay, the gold thing is mostly marketing bullshit, I'll give you that one, but some treatments that sound ridiculous actually work—like, uh, LED light therapy uses specific wavelengths to trigger cellular responses, and that's literally NASA technology they developed for astronauts.

Character 1 [en]: [deep pitch] NASA technology for your face? That's one small step for skincare, one giant leap for your credit card debt!

Character 2 [en]: Yeah yeah, very funny, but honestly the LED panels cost like $300 and last for years, which is way more economical than, erhm, getting professional treatments at $150 per session, so if you do the math it's actually pretty reasonable long-term.

Character 1 [en]: What about that caviar facial you mentioned? Are you literally rubbing fish eggs on your cheeks?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, so caviar extract—not whole eggs, obviously—it contains omega-3 fatty acids and, um, vitamins A and E in really high concentrations, which basically helps with cellular turnover and hydration, though I'll admit paying $500 for fish derivatives does feel a bit absurd sometimes.

Character 1 [en]: Sometimes? You're smearing luxury fish eggs on your face and only sometimes question it?

Character 2 [en]: Well look, when you put it that way it sounds insane, but, uh, my skin has literally never looked better and I've tracked everything—moisture levels up 23%, fine lines reduced by about 15%, and my hyperpigmentation from last summer is basically gone, so the results kind of speak for themselves, you know?
