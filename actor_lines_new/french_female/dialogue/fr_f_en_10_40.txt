Character 1 [en]: [very melancholic] Have you been keeping up with your Spanish lessons lately?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, barely. I mean, I've been trying to do like fifteen minutes a day on Duolingo but, uh, honestly it feels like I'm not really getting anywhere, you know? How's your French going?

Character 1 [en]: It's going pretty well actually! I finally understood a whole movie without subtitles.

Character 2 [en]: Wow, that's... that's actually huge! I remember when I first did that with Portuguese, it was like this whole world just, mmm, suddenly opened up. Did you watch something easy or did you dive right into like, complex stuff?

Character 1 [en]: [sniffle] Just a kids' movie. Nothing impressive really.

Character 2 [en]: Hey no, don't downplay that—kids' movies are actually perfect because they use, um, everyday vocabulary that you'll actually need. Plus the context clues from animation help so much, right? That's literally how I started with Japanese.

Character 1 [en]: [cry] You're learning Japanese too? How do you manage multiple languages?

Character 2 [en]: Okay so, truthfully? I don't. I'm terrible at it. I basically cycle through them and forget half of what I learned in one while I'm focusing on another—it's, ugh, it's kind of a mess honestly.

Character 1 [en]: That makes me feel better. I thought everyone else had it figured out.

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely not.

Character 1 [en]: [sleepily] What's the hardest part for you? Grammar or vocabulary or pronunciation?

Character 2 [en]: [cough] Ooh, definitely the cultural context stuff. Like, you can know all the words and grammar perfectly but then you'll say something that's technically correct but sounds, er, totally weird to native speakers because of some cultural nuance you missed.

Character 1 [en]: Yes! Like how in French you can't just translate jokes directly.

Character 2 [en]: Exactly, yeah! And it's not just jokes—it's, um, everything from how you order coffee to how formal you should be with strangers. Have you tried any language exchange apps to practice with native speakers?

Character 1 [en]: I downloaded HelloTalk but I'm too nervous to actually message anyone.

Character 2 [en]: Oh I totally get that. The first message is terrifying because you're like, "Am I saying this right? Will they judge my grammar?" But honestly most people are, mmm, super patient and they're learning your language too, so everyone's making mistakes together.

Character 1 [en]: Maybe I should just go for it. What's the worst that could happen?

Character 2 [en]: Right? Plus here's the thing—making mistakes is literally how you learn. I used to say "I have cold" in Spanish instead of "I am cold" for like, months, and now I'll never forget the right way because of how much my friends laughed.

Character 1 [en]: [sad] I wish I had your confidence with making mistakes.

Character 2 [en]: [shouting] But you do though! You just watched a whole movie in French! That's incredible! Stop selling yourself short—learning a language is hard and you're actually doing it, which is more than most people even attempt!
