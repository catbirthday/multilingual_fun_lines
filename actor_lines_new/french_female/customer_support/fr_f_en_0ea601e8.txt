=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: *exhale* So I'm looking at my statement and there's all these random fees I don't understand?

Customer Support [en]: Okay, um, let me pull up your account here... I see account ending in 3847. So you're asking about the international transaction fees, right? Those can definitely be confusing.

Customer [en]: Yeah exactly, like I bought something online, I think it was maybe forty dollars and somehow I'm charged fifty-three?

Customer Support [en]: Right, so what happens is, uh, when you purchase from an international merchant—let me see here, looks like transaction ID TRX-9847261—there's actually a 3.2% foreign transaction fee that gets added on top.

Customer [en]: *sharp inhale* Wait, three percent? Nobody told me about that when I signed up, this is sort of ridiculous honestly.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah, I totally get that frustration. Er, the fee disclosure is in the terms, page 47 section 12B, but I know nobody really reads all that. What I can do is see if you qualify for our international-friendly card that waives those fees.

Customer [en]: I mean I probably should've checked but who reads forty-seven pages? *nervous laugh* Can you just waive them this time?

Customer Support [en]: I wish I could, honestly. The system doesn't let me override fees from processed transactions like TRX-9847261 from November 15th. But, um, let me check something else for you real quick...

Customer [en]: *sigh* Of course not. Look I travel for work, I buy from international sites all the time, this is gonna add up to hundreds probably thousands of dollars!

Customer Support [en]: Oh interesting, so if you travel frequently for business, we actually have, er... hang on, I'm seeing you might qualify for our Premier Business account BUS-PREM-2024. That one has zero foreign transaction fees and actually reimburses past fees up to $500.

Customer [en]: Wait really? *breath* Okay so how fast can we switch because I have another trip next week and I kind of need this sorted immediately.

Customer Support [en]: Alright, so the approval is instant if you qualify. Hmm, let me run your profile through... okay, annual income checks out, credit score 742 is good. I can actually get you approved right now and expedite the card for arrival by Tuesday.

Customer [en]: Tuesday? That's cutting it close, I fly out Wednesday morning, what if it doesn't arrive, I'm sort of panicking here because last time FedEx lost my package completely!

Customer Support [en]: No no, don't worry. So what I'll do is, uh, mark this as priority overnight with tracking number... generating now... TRK-88291-EXPR. Plus I can add your new card to your digital wallet immediately, code DW-INSTANT-901, so you can use it right away on your phone.

Customer [en]: *exhale* Oh thank God okay so the digital thing works internationally? Because I think sometimes, probably my regular cards don't work overseas and then I'm stuck.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely, the digital version works everywhere the physical card does. Er, I'm also seeing here that with the Premier Business account, you get access to our 24/7 international support line at +1-800-PREMIER-7. They can help if anything comes up during your trip.

Customer [en]: *breath* This is actually way better than I expected when I called, I was ready to probably cancel everything and switch banks honestly!

Customer Support [en]: *soft laugh* Well I'm really glad we could turn this around for you. Um, so I've credited those recent fees—that's $13.47 from the three transactions this month—back to your account as credit CR-20241120-FFW. Should show up within 24 hours.

Customer [en]: Wait you're crediting them? I thought you couldn't— *nervous laugh* okay I'm not complaining but sort of confused now, how does that work exactly?

Customer Support [en]: So technically I couldn't waive the original fees, but, uh, since you're upgrading to Premier, there's a "welcome adjustment" I can apply, reference code WADJ-PREMIER-3847. Basically it's our way of saying thanks for sticking with us instead of, you know, actually switching banks.
