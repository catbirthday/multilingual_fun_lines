=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: Great. Another supplier issue. Let me see here... order RF-2941?

Customer Support [en]: Oh—uh, yes I've got that pulled up, RF-2941-QX from November 9th. I'm—sorry, it's been one of those days—so this was for, hmm, specialty flour?

Customer [en]: Mm-hmm. Contaminated batch. Third time. Peak wedding season.

Customer Support [en]: Woof, okay that's—er, let me check the supplier notes real quick. Shows here you ordered through vendor VND-8823, and they've had... oh wow, fourteen complaints this month alone.

Customer [en]: Shocking. Truly. So what's the deal with my refund?

Customer Support [en]: Right so—no wait, actually—I see they processed it but, uh, it got stuck in their system on the 14th at around 3:47 PM. Which is, hmm, frustrating I'm sure.

Customer [en]: Hmm, what if... look, I've got twelve weddings. December weddings.

Customer Support [en]: Oh gosh. Okay so—I mean, that changes things. Let me just—*sharp inhale*—alright, between you and me? I can push this through priority channel PRI-4492.

Customer [en]: Wait. You can actually do that? I've been calling for days.

Customer Support [en]: Well technically I'm supposed to wait for vendor approval but, er, given your situation and their track record... yeah I'm doing it. Should hit your account by tomorrow 9 AM Eastern.

Customer [en]: Okay so that means... I can order from someone else tonight?

Customer Support [en]: Exactly. And—actually wait, let me grab you something else. There's a code, uh... PEAK15, gives you fifteen percent off at supplier SUP-7761.

Customer [en]: That's... huh. Okay. My clients are gonna kill me if these cakes fall through.

Customer Support [en]: No no, we're not letting that happen. Your refund of $1,847.92 is processing now, transaction TXN-998214-B, and honestly? Vendor VND-8823 is getting flagged.

Customer [en]: Let me see... December 4th, 7th, 9th... yeah I need flour by Monday.

Customer Support [en]: Monday like—er, this Monday? *exhale* Okay so supplier SUP-7761 does next-day if you order before 11 PM tonight, ships from warehouse 445 Oak Street.

Customer [en]: God. Yes. This Monday. Everything's just... it's a lot right now.

Customer Support [en]: I totally—hmm, I get it. Look, I'm putting a note on your account ACC-5524-WK that you get priority support, so if anything goes wrong, we jump on it immediately.

Customer [en]: That's actually... thank you. Really. You saved my business here.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, that's what we—well, that's why I'm here. And um, good luck with those twelve weddings. That's, er... that's pretty incredible actually.
