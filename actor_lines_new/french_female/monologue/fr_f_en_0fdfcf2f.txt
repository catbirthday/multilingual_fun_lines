=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] They said yes. They actually— they actually said yes. [gasp loudly] Five million dollars. Five MILLION. I keep saying it out loud because I don't— I can't quite believe it's real. [very excited] All those nights rehearsing in front of the mirror, rewriting slide seventeen for the hundredth time, practicing my answers to every possible question they could throw at me. [laugh] And then Johnson asks the ONE thing I didn't prepare for and I just, um... I just answered from the gut and apparently that's what sealed it? [relieved] God, my hands are still shaking. I should call Mom. She's been— she's been so worried about me burning through my savings. [pause] Four months. Four months of rejections and "interesting concept but not for us" and "come back when you have more traction." [very sincerely] I was starting to think maybe I was delusional, you know? Maybe everyone was right and this was just some pipe dream. [laugh loudly] But here we are! We're actually going to build this thing. We're going to— [trailing off] oh man, we're going to need to hire people. Like, real people. With salaries. [anxious] That's, uh... that's terrifying actually. [confident] No, you know what? We've got this. We just convinced Goldman's top VC team. We can do anything. [extremely happy] WE GOT THE FUNDING!
