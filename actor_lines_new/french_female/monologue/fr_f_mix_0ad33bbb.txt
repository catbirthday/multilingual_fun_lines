=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [frustrated] Twenty-three years. Vingt-trois ans que je fais ce travail, et maintenant ils sont juste—ils ferment tout. [pause] You know what the worst part is? On commence enfin à voir que ça marche. [very sad] Marcus came in yesterday, six months clean, il me montrait des photos de la fête d'anniversaire de sa fille. Première fois qu'il y était depuis 3 ans. [shaky voice] And Sarah—Sarah just got her nursing license back. [long pause] These are real people with real lives, et on est censées leur dire quoi, bonne chance? [bitter] The state says there's no money. [sarcastic] Right, no money, mais ils viennent d'approuver la rénovation du stade. [angry] Forty million dollars for luxury boxes, mais on peut pas garder nos portes ouvertes pour des gens qui essaient de pas mourir. [sigh] I keep thinking about, euh... ce que je vais leur dire. Comment tu dis à quelqu'un qui est enfin en train de sortir de l'enfer qu'on lui enlève son échelle? [very quietly] Marcus asked me if he did something wrong. Genre c'était de sa faute à lui. [crying while speaking] I couldn't even look at him. [pause] All these success stories, all this progress, et c'est juste... fini. [exhausted] Because of a budget line item. À cause d'une putain de ligne budgétaire.


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [frustrated] Twenty-three years. Twenty-three years I've been doing this work, and now they're just—they're shutting us down. [pause] You know what the worst part is? We're finally seeing it work. [very sad] Marcus came in yesterday, six months clean, showing me pictures of his daughter's birthday party. First one he's been to in three years. [shaky voice] And Sarah—Sarah just got her nursing license back. [long pause] These are real people with real lives, and we're just supposed to, what, tell them good luck? [bitter] The state says there's no money. [sarcastic] Right, no money, but they just approved that new stadium renovation. [angry] Forty million dollars for luxury boxes, but we can't keep our doors open for people trying not to die. [sigh] I keep thinking about, um... about what I'm going to say to them. How do you tell someone who's finally climbing out of hell that we're taking away their ladder? [very quietly] Marcus asked me if he did something wrong. Like this was his fault somehow. [crying while speaking] I couldn't even look at him. [pause] All these success stories, all this progress, and it's just... gone. [exhausted] Because of a budget line item.
