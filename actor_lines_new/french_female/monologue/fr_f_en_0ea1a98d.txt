Subject: The plastics plant efficiency improvement you designed reducing environmental impact by forty percent

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [relieved] Forty percent. God, when I see that number I still can't quite... I mean, we actually did it. [laugh] You know what's funny? Three years ago, everyone said I was crazy. The board was like, "These efficiency targets are, um, unrealistic." [frustrated] And I get it, I do, because retrofitting an entire plastics plant while keeping production going is— [sigh] it's basically rebuilding the plane while you're flying it. [anxious] But the thing is, we couldn't just keep dumping that much waste heat, you know? [passionately] Every night I'd drive past those cooling towers just... steaming away into nothing, and I'd think about my kids. [pause] Like, what am I leaving them? [very quietly] So we started with the heat recovery systems. [speeding up] Then the new polymer processing lines, the automated quality control that reduced defects by, uh, something like sixty percent— [excited] oh, and the closed-loop water system! [warm] That one was my baby. [chuckle] People thought I was obsessed, checking the monitoring systems at like, two in the morning. [slowly] But when the quarterly report came in and we'd hit forty percent reduction in environmental impact while actually increasing output? [extremely happy] Man, even the skeptics were speechless. [very sincerely] Sometimes you just have to be stubborn enough to prove something's possible, I guess.
