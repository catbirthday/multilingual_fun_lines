=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Marcus? What are you—how did you even get past security? You can't just, um, show up at my office after seven years of nothing, not a single word, and expect me to—

Character 2 [en]: [quietly defiant] Still my sister.

Character 1 [en]: [closing off] No, see, that's where you're wrong. Sisters don't disappear into thin air, don't leave their family wondering if they're dead in some alley somewhere, while they're apparently, what, writing memoirs? [bitter laugh]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] I needed to disappear, Ellie. After what happened with Dad, after the trial, I couldn't—[exhales]—couldn't stay in that life anymore, pretending everything was normal when we both know it wasn't.

Character 1 [en]: So you just left me to clean up everything? The lawyers, the creditors, Mom's breakdown, all of it? While you were out there finding yourself or whatever this is supposed to be?

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] You think sleeping under bridges and eating from dumpsters is finding myself? I wrote this because, um, because I finally understood what actually happened to us as kids, what Dad really was. [voice dropping]

Character 1 [en]: [sharply] Don't. Whatever you've written in that... that thing, I don't want to know. I've spent years in therapy trying to forget, and now you waltz in here expecting me to what, publish it?

Character 2 [en]: You were always the one who said stories could heal people, remember? That's what you told me when we were hiding in the closet, listening to him rage downstairs—you'd whisper stories to keep me calm.

Character 1 [en]: [voice breaking slightly] That was different, Marcus. We were children then, and I was just trying to protect you from—[swallows hard]—from understanding how bad things really were. [quieter]

Character 2 [en]: Maybe I'm trying to protect you now, by telling the truth about what he did to me when you weren't there, the things I never told anyone, not even you.

Character 1 [en]: What do you mean, when I wasn't there? I was always there, I never left you alone with him if I could help it, I—[faltering]

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Those Tuesday nights when you had debate club, when Mom worked late at the hospital? You couldn't have known, Ellie. I made sure you never knew because, um, because you already carried enough.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Oh God, Marcus.

Character 2 [en]: It's all in here.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Why now? Why tell me now?

Character 2 [en]: [softly] Because I'm dying, Ellie. Liver's shot, maybe six months left, and I needed you to know that none of it was your fault. [pause] You were the only good thing in that house.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] There are treatments, we can get you help, I have insurance through the company, we can figure this out, you don't have to just give up—

Character 2 [en]: I'm not giving up, I'm, err, I'm finally letting go. There's a difference. And maybe if you read this, you can let go too.

Character 1 [en]: I can't—Marcus, I can't lose you again, not like this, not when we finally have a chance to—[breaking down]—God, I've missed you so much, you absolute idiot.

Character 2 [en]: [reaching out] Come here, Ellie. It's okay. We're okay now. Maybe we can figure out how to be family again, even if it's just for a little while. [voice thick with emotion]
