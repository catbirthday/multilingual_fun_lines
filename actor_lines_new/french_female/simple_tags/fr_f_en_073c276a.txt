=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: So, um, I heard you're the one who found it—the beetle or whatever it is that's got the agricultural department in panic mode. [pause] My firm needs to know how bad this really is.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly] It's not a beetle, Marcus. It's a stem borer, and yeah, I identified it. [sighs] After six years of not talking, this is what brings you to my lab?

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Look, I've got seventeen million dollars of client money in corn futures that mature in three weeks, alright? This isn't about us, it's about—[exhales] I need to know if I should pull out.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] The Heteropsylla cubana variant we found can destroy an entire field in under two weeks once it reaches critical mass. We're, uh, we're talking about potential crop losses of sixty to eighty percent.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Jesus Christ, Rebecca. Sixty to eighty? That's not just my clients going under, that's... that's retirement funds, college savings. [shaky voice] Why isn't this public yet?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] The USDA wants confirmation before they trigger a market panic, but honestly? We've confirmed it three times already. The larvae samples from Iowa, um, they're definitely the invasive variant.

Character 1 [en]: [very quietly] Iowa.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] Marcus, I'm telling you this because despite everything, you're still family, okay? You need to, erm, you need to get your clients out before Monday's report goes public.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter] Family. Right. The same family loyalty that had you testifying about Dad's insider trading? [pause] Now you're giving me a heads up about market-moving information?

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Dad was guilty and you know it. This is different—I'm trying to help you avoid the same mistakes he made. [sighs] The infestation data, it's going to be public knowledge anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [desperately] How fast does this thing spread? Like, if it's in Iowa now, how long before it hits Illinois, Nebraska? I need, ah, I need specifics here, Becca.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] With current wind patterns and the adult flight range we've observed? Maybe, um, maybe three weeks to Illinois, five to Nebraska if we're lucky. [clearing throat] But that's assuming no additional introduction points.

Character 1 [en]: [furious] Three weeks? My contracts mature in three weeks! [voice breaking] Do you have any idea what this means? People trusted me with their futures, their actual futures.

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Which is why I'm telling you now, even though technically I shouldn't be discussing this before publication. You've got, hmm, maybe seventy-two hours before the preliminary findings leak anyway.

Character 1 [en]: [mumbling] Seventy-two hours to unwind seventeen million in positions without triggering a selloff. [louder] The SEC's going to be all over this, you realize that?

Character 2 [en]: [calmly] Only if you're stupid about it. Diversify the exits, cite portfolio rebalancing, spread it across multiple clearing houses. [pause] Remember what Dad always said about leaving too many footprints?

Character 1 [en]: [confused] You're actually helping me. After everything, after the trial, after you literally chose your career over your own father, you're... why?

Character 2 [en]: Because unlike Dad, you're not manipulating markets for yacht money—you're trying to protect people's retirements. [sighs] And maybe because I'm tired of being the sister who destroyed our family.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] You didn't destroy anything, Becca. He did that himself when he... [trailing off] Look, if I move these positions, if I save these accounts, would you maybe consider having coffee sometime?

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Save your clients first, Marcus. Then, yeah, coffee sounds good. [chuckles] But somewhere far from both Wall Street and my lab, deal?
