[bitter] Everyone keeps texting me congratulations, like I won something. Like this is some kind of victory lap I should be taking. [confused] But I'm just sitting here staring at the wall, and I don't feel... anything? [frustrated] I thought I'd feel relieved. I thought I'd feel, I don't know, vindicated maybe? [sniffle] All those nights I couldn't sleep, replaying everything, imagining this exact moment. [very quietly] Imagining how good it would feel when they finally believed me. [regretful] But it doesn't bring back those seven years. It doesn't, um... it doesn't undo what happened. [shaky voice] My friends threw a party last night. They kept saying justice was served, raising their glasses. [bitter] Justice. [pause] What does that even mean now? [sad] He goes to prison, sure. But I'm still here with all these, uh, all these pieces that don't fit back together right. [trailing off] I thought when this day came, I'd finally be able to move on... [long pause] [exhausted] Maybe that's the real joke. There's no magical moment where everything gets fixed. [very melancholic] You just keep going, carrying it all with you, verdict or no verdict."
