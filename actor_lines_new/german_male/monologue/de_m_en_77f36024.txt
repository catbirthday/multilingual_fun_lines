=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [hesitantly] I know that move. [pause] Mrs. Chen's new "nephew" helping with her computer—mmm, the way he steered the conversation to her bank accounts? [bitter] Classic confidence build. [sigh] God, I used to do the exact same thing back in... well, doesn't matter when. [regretful] The overly patient voice, the little touches on the shoulder, asking about her late husband to seem caring. [angry] That's not kindness, that's research. [pause] You learn what they're vulnerable about and then you, uh... you exploit it. [quietly] I did it for three years. [clearing throat] But here's the thing—I know every tell. [confidently] The way he avoided direct eye contact when she asked about his family, how he deflected when she mentioned meeting his mother? [speeding up] And oh man, the gift he brought her—expensive but generic, no thought behind it. [passionate] That's guilt spending, not genuine. [determined] So yeah, I called Adult Protective Services this morning. [warm] Gave them the whole playbook he's running. [chuckle] Takes a con to know a con, right? [very sincerely] Maybe this is how I finally, um... balance things out somehow. [relieved] They're sending someone today.
