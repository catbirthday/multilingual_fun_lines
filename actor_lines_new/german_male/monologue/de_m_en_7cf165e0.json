Twenty-three dollars an hour to prepare five-course dinners, and she's talking about theft because I ate some truffle oil on bread. [frustrated] You know what kills me? They throw away more food after their dinner parties than I've eaten in three months working there. [short pause] But no, no, suddenly I'm the criminal because I— because I what? Because I tasted the Wagyu to make sure it was properly seasoned? [upset] Because I needed to eat something other than the ramen waiting for me at home? [voice breaking] I cooked for their fundraisers, their anniversary, their kid's graduation party. [cry] I made that child's favorite birthday cake three years in a row. [sniffle] And they fire me over, what, maybe two hundred dollars of ingredients across five months? [angry] While wearing jewelry worth more than I make in a year. [pause] The worst part is, um... the worst part is I actually thought they cared about me. [very sad] Mrs. Henderson used to ask about my mom's health.
