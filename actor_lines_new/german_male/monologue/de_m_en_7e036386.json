[confused] he started crying. Right there in the hallway. And then he said this thing about how his dad, um... how his dad hits him. [pause] Like, regularly. [quietly] And his mom just watches. \n\nI mean, I've hated this kid for three years. Three years of him making my life hell, and now I'm standing there and he's telling me that he goes home and... [upset] Jesus, I don't know what to do with this. Part of me is still so angry, you know? Like all those times he shoved me into lockers, called me those names, made me feel like nothing—that still happened. [frustrated] That was still real. \n\nBut then, mmm, I keep thinking about him going home to that. [empathetically] And I guess maybe... maybe when you're getting hit at home, you have to hit someone else just to feel like you have any power at all? [sigh] I don't know if I can forgive him. I don't even know if I should. But I can't, uh... I can't hate him the same way anymore. [very sad] How am I supposed to hate him now?"
