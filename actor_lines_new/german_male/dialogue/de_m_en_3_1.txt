Character 1 [en]: What's the deadliest animal to humans?

Character 2 [en]: Mosquitoes, hands down. They kill about 750,000 people annually through disease transmission. Makes sharks look like puppies—they only manage about ten deaths per year.

Character 1 [en]: Really? Not snakes or something bigger?

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] Well, snakes do come second actually, killing around 100,000 yearly. But mosquitoes are the real killers—malaria, dengue, yellow fever. Those tiny vampires are basically flying syringes of death.

Character 1 [en]: What about the ocean? Deepest point?

Character 2 [en]: [very excited] The Mariana Trench, Challenger Deep specifically! We're talking nearly 36,000 feet down. The pressure there would crush most submarines like tin cans. Only three people have ever been to the bottom!

Character 1 [en]: [short pause] Three people? Who?

Character 2 [en]: Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh in 1960, then James Cameron solo in 2012. Cameron said it was like being on another planet—completely alien, desolate, magnificent.

Character 1 [en]: Most expensive thing humans ever built?

Character 2 [en]: That would be the International Space Station. Around 150 billion dollars, give or take. It's the most expensive object ever constructed by humans, orbiting up there right now.

Character 1 [en]: Why's it so expensive?

Character 2 [en]: [belly laugh] Because everything costs more when you have to launch it into space! Every pound of material costs thousands to get up there. Plus international collaboration, cutting-edge tech, decades of work.

Character 1 [en]: Hardest dish to cook perfectly?

Character 2 [en]: Depends who you ask, but a lot of chefs say soufflé. It's all timing—one wrong move and it collapses. You need precise temperature control and absolutely no sudden movements.

Character 1 [en]: Ever made one?

Character 2 [en]: Attempted? Yes. Successfully? That's debatable. Mine looked more like a deflated tire than French elegance. But hey, it tasted decent, which counts for something, right?

Character 1 [en]: What kills dreams fastest?

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] Fear of failure, probably. Most people never even try because they're terrified of looking foolish. The irony is that failure's actually how we learn—every mistake teaches us something valuable.

Character 1 [en]: [shouting] But what if you fail publicly?

Character 2 [en]: Then you join the club of every successful person ever. Edison had a thousand failed lightbulbs. Jordan got cut from his high school basketball team. Public failure means you're actually trying.
