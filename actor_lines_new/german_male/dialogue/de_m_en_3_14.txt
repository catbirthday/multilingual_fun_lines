Character 1 [en]: Is it normal that I can't find my lungs?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering loudly] Okay, um, they're definitely still in your chest cavity—I mean, you're talking right now, so that's actually a really good sign that your respiratory system is, you know, functioning properly.

Character 1 [en]: But I swallowed so much water just now!

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, that's basically the freediving baptism right there. Everyone drinks half the ocean their first time; I personally consumed enough saltwater to pickle a cucumber farm, but hey, your body's surprisingly good at, uh, sorting that out.

Character 1 [en]: Why didn't you mention the burning nose thing?

Character 2 [en]: Ahh, yeah, the nose situation—so that's actually your sinuses having a little tantrum about the pressure changes. It feels like someone's blowtorching your brain, but I promise it gets better after, hmm, maybe twenty more dives or so.

Character 1 [en]: Twenty?! I can barely do one!

Character 2 [en]: [laugh hard] Wait wait, you thought you'd just gracefully dolphin your way down there first try? Buddy, I spent my first session looking like a drowning starfish—arms everywhere, legs doing their own thing, it was genuinely embarrassing.

Character 1 [en]: How deep did we even go?

Character 2 [en]: [laugh histerically] Okay so, technically we made it to about three feet, which I know sounds pathetic, but honestly that's deeper than my cousin Steve managed in his entire first month—he just kind of... floated there like a confused buoy!

Character 1 [en]: My ears feel like they're going to explode.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, yeah, that's the equalizing thing I was trying to explain earlier. You gotta pinch your nose and, like, gently blow—but not too hard or you'll, uh, basically turn yourself into a human pressure cooker.

Character 1 [en]: Is that seal laughing at me?

Character 2 [en]: Oh absolutely, seals are notorious hecklers actually. They watch beginners flail around for entertainment; it's basically their version of reality TV, except, you know, we're the ones making fools of ourselves.

Character 1 [en]: I think I just invented a new swimming stroke.

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] That magnificent display of aquatic chaos you just performed? That's what we professionals call the "panicked sea spider"—very advanced technique, usually takes people years to master, but you're obviously a natural at looking completely uncoordinated!

Character 1 [en]: [very slowly] Everything... tastes... like... salt...

Character 2 [en]: [cry] I know, I know, your mouth becomes this horrible salt factory and nothing tastes right for hours! Just wait until tomorrow when you blow your nose—it's gonna be like the ocean's personal revenge, trust me on that one.

Character 1 [en]: [smiling speaking] At least I didn't need the emergency floatie!

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Okay look, that floatie saved my life three times last year alone, alright? There's no shame in the floatie game—even Olympic freedivers probably keep one hidden somewhere, just, uhh, for emergencies or whatever!
