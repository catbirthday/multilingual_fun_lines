Character 1 [en]: So I've been looking at my portfolio and, um, I keep seeing this ROA number but I honestly have no clue if mine is good or terrible.

Character 2 [en]: Oh okay, so return on assets is basically, like, how efficiently a company uses what it owns to generate profit. If you're seeing it in your portfolio, it's probably showing you how well each company you own stock in is, uh, performing with their resources. Most people want to see at least 5% but it really depends on the industry.

Character 1 [en]: Mine says 3.2% which sounds pathetic.

Character 2 [en]: [joking] Well I mean, if you're comparing yourself to Apple or something then yeah, you're gonna feel pretty bad about life. But honestly, 3.2% isn't terrible depending on what sectors you're in—banks and utilities often run lower because they need massive assets just to operate.

Character 1 [en]: Wait wait wait, this is for my whole portfolio? I thought it was like, per company or something.

Character 2 [en]: Ohh no no, if you're seeing one number for your entire portfolio, that's... that's actually kind of weird? Usually ROA is calculated company by company because, I mean, you don't technically own the assets yourself, you own shares in companies that own assets. Your broker might be doing some kind of weighted average thing maybe?

Character 1 [en]: God, this is why I hate investing, everything has seventeen different definitions and nobody explains anything properly.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Yeah I know, it's, uh, it's really frustrating and honestly the financial industry kind of likes keeping things confusing because then people need advisors and... sorry, I'm not trying to make it worse. Let me actually help—what platform are you using to see this number?

Character 1 [en]: It's that new app everyone's using, uh, WealthTracker or whatever.

Character 2 [en]: Ohhh okay, yeah, WealthTracker does this weird thing where they calculate a "personal ROA" based on your total returns divided by your account value, which is not really how ROA is supposed to work at all. It's more like, hmm, a bastardized version that they made up for marketing basically.

Character 1 [en]: So it's completely meaningless then?

Character 2 [en]: Not completely meaningless but, like, definitely not what actual financial analysts would use. The real ROA that matters is for individual companies—so if you own, say, Walmart stock, you'd want to know Walmart's ROA to see if they're using their stores and inventory efficiently to make money, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Can you just tell me if I should panic about my 3.2% or not?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? For what WealthTracker is measuring, which is essentially just your returns, 3.2% is, uh, pretty rough if that's annual. The S&P 500 averaged like 10% annually over the last decade, so you're underperforming the market by quite a bit actually.

Character 1 [en]: Great, so I am terrible at this.

Character 2 [en]: [loudly] No no no, hang on! That doesn't mean you're terrible—maybe you just started investing during a downturn or you're in conservative investments on purpose! Context matters so much here and one metric without the full picture is basically useless!

Character 1 [en]: I've been doing this for three years though, shouldn't I have figured something out by now?

Character 2 [en]: [whispering loudly] Three years is nothing in investing terms, seriously, like some people take a decade to find their strategy! And honestly, if you're not losing money and you're learning, that's actually pretty good—most beginners blow up their first account completely!

Character 1 [en]: Wait, people actually lose everything? Like their whole account goes to zero?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, yeah, especially with options trading or, like, leveraged ETFs that people don't understand. At least you're looking at metrics and trying to understand them, which, I mean, that already puts you ahead of the people who just YOLO into meme stocks and pray, you know?
