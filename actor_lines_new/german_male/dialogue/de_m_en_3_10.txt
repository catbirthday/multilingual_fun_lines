Character 1 [en]: Did you see what happened at the meeting?

Character 2 [en]: [laugh histerically] Oh my god, yes! When Tom's screen share showed his, um, his dating app notifications popping up during the quarterly review? I couldn't, I just couldn't keep a straight face.

Character 1 [en]: He turned so red.

Character 2 [en]: The CEO trying to pretend nothing happened was almost worse though. Like, she just kept talking about profit margins while everyone could see "Jessica matched with you!" right there on the screen.

Character 1 [en]: Think he'll ever live it down?

Character 2 [en]: [regretful] Honestly? No. I mean, I feel bad for him, I really do, but this is the kind of thing that, uh, follows you around the office forever, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Poor guy.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, it's... eesh, it's rough. Remember when Sarah accidentally sent that email about her boss to, well, her actual boss? She left like two months later.

Character 1 [en]: Different though, right?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, true. Tom's thing was embarrassing but harmless. Sarah basically called her manager incompetent in, um, pretty colorful language if I remember correctly.

Character 1 [en]: Speaking of managers, heard anything about the promotion?

Character 2 [en]: [extremely happy] Yes! Oh wow, yes! They offered it to me this morning! I'm trying not to, like, scream about it but I'm absolutely thrilled!

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] Wait... you... you got it?

Character 2 [en]: I know, I know! I didn't want to say anything until it was official but, yeah, they called me in at eight-thirty and just... offered it right there.

Character 1 [en]: That's incredible! When do you start?

Character 2 [en]: Monday, apparently. Which is, uh, terrifying honestly. Like, I've been preparing for weeks but suddenly it feels way too soon, you know what I mean?

Character 1 [en]: [speeding up] Oh oh oh, we should celebrate! Drinks after work?

Character 2 [en]: Actually, yes, that sounds perfect. Let's, um, let's get the whole team together. I mean, assuming people aren't too traumatized from Tom's dating app incident to come out.

Character 1 [en]: Ha! I'll send the invite.

Character 2 [en]: Cool. And hey, maybe avoid mentioning screen sharing in the invitation? Poor Tom's probably had enough reminders for one day, honestly.
