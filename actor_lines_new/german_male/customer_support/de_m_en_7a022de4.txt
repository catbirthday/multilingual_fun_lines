=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: I unsubscribed from your marketing emails three weeks ago, but I'm still receiving multiple messages daily. This needs to stop.

Customer Support [en]: I sincerely apologize for this issue. Let me access your account immediately to investigate. May I have the email address that's receiving these messages?

Customer [en]: It's robert.chen@techconsult.net. I've unsubscribed twice now through your system.

Customer Support [en]: Thank you. I've located your account, ID number RCH-847392. I can see your unsubscribe request was processed on November 2, 2024, at 3:47 PM Eastern Time. Let me check our email suppression list.

Customer [en]: If it was processed, why am I still getting emails? I received four just yesterday.

Customer Support [en]: I've identified the issue. Your email was successfully removed from our primary marketing list MAR-2024-Q4, but you're still active on three subsidiary lists: TECH-NEWS-847, PROD-UPDATE-223, and WEBINAR-INVITE-Q4.

Customer [en]: That's unacceptable. When I unsubscribe, it should remove me from everything. How did this happen?

Customer Support [en]: You're absolutely right. Our unsubscribe process should remove you from all lists simultaneously. This appears to be a synchronization error between our systems that occurred during our October 28, 2024 database migration.

Customer [en]: Are there other customers experiencing this? And what about my rights under CAN-SPAM regulations?

Customer Support [en]: Certainly.

Customer [en]: I need specifics. How many people are affected and what are you doing about it?

Customer Support [en]: Our audit shows 1,847 customers were affected by this synchronization issue. We've already corrected 1,203 accounts as of yesterday, with full resolution expected by end of business today, November 23, 2024.

Customer [en]: What compensation are you offering for this violation? This has been going on for three weeks.

Customer Support [en]: I understand your frustration completely. I'm authorized to issue a $75 credit to your account, reference code COMP-2024-NOV-8473, and I'm escalating this to our compliance team for additional review.

Customer [en]: That's a start. Can you guarantee I won't receive any more emails after today?

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely. I'm manually removing your email from all 14 active lists in our system right now. The suppression will be complete within the next 15 minutes, confirmation number SUP-884739-FINAL.

Customer [en]: I want written confirmation of this removal and the steps you've taken.

Customer Support [en]: Of course. I'll send a detailed confirmation to your email within the hour, including case number CS-2024-112384, all affected list IDs, and timestamps of each removal action.

Customer [en]: Good. And if I receive even one more marketing email after today?

Customer Support [en]: Should that occur, contact us immediately with reference number PRI-ESCALATE-8847. You'll be connected directly to our compliance team, and we'll implement additional remediation including potential compensation up to $500 under our service guarantee policy SG-2024-15.
