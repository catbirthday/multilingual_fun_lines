=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Well this is interesting, I don't usually get calls from corporate security while I'm literally standing in the substation control room monitoring the grid. [pause] What exactly seems to be the problem with my account?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Sir, we've detected unauthorized access attempts on your employee credentials from multiple foreign IP addresses. [quickly] I need to verify your identity before we can proceed with securing your account and preventing potential infrastructure breaches.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] Foreign IP addresses, that does sound serious. [slowly] Which specific substations were they trying to access through my credentials, because I only have clearance for the three facilities in the northwest district.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The attempts were made on, let me check here, substations in sectors four through seven. [clearing throat] For security purposes, I'll need you to confirm your employee ID number and the last four digits of your social security number.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Oh sectors four through seven, those are the interesting ones with the new SCADA systems we installed last month. [chuckles] Funny thing though, we don't actually use sector designations in our grid mapping, we use alphanumeric codes.

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Right, yes, the alphanumeric system, that's what I meant to say. [pause] Sir, time is critical here, every minute we delay gives these hackers more opportunity to compromise the power grid infrastructure.

Character 1 [en]: [playful] You're absolutely right about time being critical. [slowly] Say, which department did you say you were calling from again, because our security team usually contacts us through the encrypted internal messaging system, never phone calls.

Character 2 [en]: [nervously] This is an emergency protocol override situation, which requires direct voice confirmation. [speeding up] I'm with the Critical Infrastructure Protection unit, badge number seven four nine two, and we need to act immediately.

Character 1 [en]: [amused] Badge number seven four nine two, I'll definitely make note of that. [sighs] You know what's really fascinating is that I'm looking at our internal directory right now and there's no Critical Infrastructure Protection unit listed anywhere.

Character 2 [en]: [frustrated] Sir, I'm trying to help you here! [loudly] If your account gets compromised, you could be held personally liable for any damage to the power grid or customer data breaches that result.

Character 1 [en]: [calmly] Personal liability, that's a good touch, really adds urgency to the whole thing. [pause] But here's what I'm wondering, how did you get this direct line when it's not listed anywhere public and only routes through our operations center?

Character 2 [en]: [defensive] We have access to all employee contact information through the security database. [exhales] Look, if you don't want to cooperate, I'll have to escalate this to your supervisor and recommend immediate suspension of your access privileges.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] Oh please do escalate it to my supervisor, her name is Patricia Chen. [chuckles] I'm sure she'd love to hear about this security breach you've detected, especially since she's sitting right here next to me.

Character 2 [en]: [angrily] You think this is some kind of joke? [pause] Fine, when the FBI shows up at your door asking about the ransomware attack that came through your credentials, don't say we didn't try to warn you.

Character 1 [en]: [stern] Now you're bringing in the FBI too, this just keeps getting better. [slowly] You know what's interesting though, every single call into this facility is recorded and traced for security purposes, real security purposes.

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Recording this call is actually a federal violation without proper consent from both parties. [quickly] I'm going to have to terminate this call now and report this incident to the appropriate authorities.

Character 1 [en]: [very calmly] The appropriate authorities, yes, I think that's an excellent idea actually. [pause] Our cybersecurity team loves collecting samples of social engineering attempts, and you've given them such wonderful material to work with today.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] You people always think you're so smart, don't you? [muttering] Whatever, enjoy explaining to your boss why you wasted twenty minutes of company time playing games instead of doing your actual job.

Character 1 [en]: [warmly] Actually, this is part of my job, we're required to document and report all phishing attempts. [chuckles] The security training department is going to use this recording in next month's awareness seminar, so thanks for the educational content.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated] Just remember this conversation when your identity gets stolen and your credit gets destroyed. [trailing off] Some people just can't be helped even when someone's trying to protect them from—[click]
