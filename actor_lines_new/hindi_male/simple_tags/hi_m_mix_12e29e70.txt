=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [furious] You killed him. तुमने सच में उसे मार दिया। [pause] तीन साल, पूरे तीन साल मैंने उस कमीने के खिलाफ केस बनाया था, सबूत जमा किए थे, victims की गवाहियाँ इकट्ठी की थीं—सब कुछ जो हमें चाहिए था पूरे corrupt network को expose करने के लिए, और तुमने बस जाकर उसके सिर में गोली मार दी।

Character 2 [mix]: [coldly] He was planning to disappear tomorrow morning. चौदह million के stolen relief funds लेकर भागने वाला था। [firmly] तुम्हारा इंकलाब रुक सकता था, लेकिन camps में भूखे मर रहे वो परिवार नहीं रुक सकते थे।

Character 1 [mix]: [frustrated] Don't you understand what you've done? [shouting] उसकी मौत ने उसे उसके supporters के लिए शहीद बना दिया है, और अब मेरे सारे गवाह डर के मारे सामने आने से मना कर रहे हैं क्योंकि उन्हें लगता है कोई assassin है जो उससे जुड़े हर इंसान को मार रहा है!

Character 2 [mix]: Good. डरने दो उन्हें।

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] That's your solution to everything, isn't it? [sighs] डर और हिंसा, जैसे हम उस regime से कुछ बेहतर नहीं हैं जिसके खिलाफ लड़ रहे हैं। लोगों को publicly, transparently न्याय होते देखना था, ताकि वो believe कर सकें कि बदलाव मुमकिन है।

Character 2 [mix]: [harshly] Justice? तुम्हारा न्याय सालों लगा देता जबकि वो judges की जेबें भरता रहता। [laughs] तुम्हारे perfect इंकलाब का इंतज़ार करते करते कितने और बच्चे मर जाते?

Character 1 [mix]: [passionately] Revolution isn't just about removing bad people. ये सबको दिखाने के बारे में है कि एक बेहतर रास्ता है! [pause] जब तुम अंधेरे में किसी को execute करते हो, तुम वही tyranny बन जाते हो जिससे लोग डरते हैं।

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] I found seven bodies in his basement last week. [very quietly] बच्चे थे जिन्होंने ज़्यादा सवाल पूछे थे कि खाने की shipments कहाँ गईं। अब फिर से सुनाओ मुझे अपनी moral high ground के बारे में।

Character 1 [mix]: [shaky voice] I didn't know about the children. [long pause] लेकिन ये हमारे तरीकों के बारे में कुछ नहीं बदलता—बल्कि ये expose करना उसके पूरे faction की credibility हमेशा के लिए खत्म कर देता।

Character 2 [mix]: [sarcastically] Forever is a luxury dead children don't have. [firmly] मैंने सोलह shipments को divert होने से रोका है, तीन गाँवों को भुखमरी से बचाया है, ये सब तब जब तुम paperwork file कर रहे थे और भाषण दे रहे थे।

Character 1 [mix]: [defensively] Those speeches inspire thousands to resist! [angrily] Public support के बिना, legitimacy के बिना, हम बस एक और गिरोह हैं जो सत्ता के टुकड़ों के लिए लड़ रहा है। लोगों को उम्मीद चाहिए, सड़क पर और लाशें नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [laughs bitterly] Hope doesn't fill empty stomachs or stop bullets. [pause] मैंने देखा है तुम्हारे peaceful protests का कत्लेआम होते हुए जबकि सरकारी अफसर अपनी रिश्वत गिन रहे होते हैं। कम से कम मेरे तरीके से results तो मिलते हैं।

Character 1 [mix]: [empathetically] I know you've lost people too. [softly] लेकिन हर बार जब तुम बिना trial के, बिना publicly सबूत पेश किए मारते हो, तुम regime को ammunition देते हो हम सबको terrorists कहने के लिए।

Character 2 [mix]: [harshly] They already call us terrorists! [exhales] फर्क सिर्फ इतना है कि मैं उन्हें रात को अपने बिस्तर के नीचे check करवाता हूँ, ये सोचकर कि कहीं उनके crimes finally उन तक पहुँच तो नहीं गए।

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] And what happens when we win? [pause] जब युद्ध खत्म हो जाएगा और हमने लोगों को सिर्फ यही सिखाया होगा कि ताकत डर और execution से आती है? हम बस एक और तानाशाही बना देंगे अलग चेहरों के साथ।

Character 2 [mix]: [unpredictably soft] Maybe you're right about the future. [suddenly harsh] लेकिन मैं आज से deal कर रहा हूँ, और आज एक और अफसर Sector 7 की water supply में ज़हर मिलाने की planning कर रहा है। क्या मैं तुम्हारी committee के vote का इंतज़ार करूँ?

Character 1 [mix]: The Sector 7 threat—how do you even know about that? हमने वो communications सिर्फ दो घंटे पहले intercept किए थे।

Character 2 [mix]: Because unlike you, I don't wait for information to come through proper channels. [pause] उसकी assistant महीनों से मुझे intel दे रही है, डरी हुई है लेकिन मदद करने को तैयार है जो कुछ उसने देखा उसके बाद।

Character 1 [mix]: [slowly] If you have an inside source, we could use that. हम सब कुछ document कर सकते हैं, एक airtight case बना सकते हैं जो पूरे chemical weapons program को गिरा दे। [pleading] बस इस बार हमारे साथ काम करो।

Character 2 [mix]: [considering] You have forty-eight hours before that poison ships. [firmly] अगर तब तक तुम्हारे तरीके ने इसे नहीं रोका, तो मैं अपने तरीके से handle करूँगा। [pause] और इस बार, मैं सिर्फ orders देने वाले अफसर पर नहीं रुकूँगा।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [furious] You killed him. You actually killed him. [pause] Three years I spent building a case against that bastard, gathering evidence, testimonies from victims—everything we needed to expose the entire corrupt network, and you just put a bullet in his head.

Character 2: [coldly] He was planning to disappear tomorrow morning with fourteen million in stolen relief funds. [firmly] Your revolution could wait, but those families starving in the camps couldn't.

Character 1: [frustrated] Don't you understand what you've done? [shouting] His death makes him a martyr to his supporters, and now all my witnesses are too terrified to come forward because they think there's some assassin hunting everyone connected to him!

Character 2: Good. Let them be afraid.

Character 1: [bitter] That's your solution to everything, isn't it? [sighs] Fear and violence, like we're no better than the regime we're fighting against. The people needed to see justice done publicly, transparently, to believe change is possible.

Character 2: [harshly] Justice? Your justice would have taken years while he lined judges' pockets. [laughs] How many more children would have died waiting for your perfect revolution?

Character 1: [passionately] Revolution isn't just about removing bad people, it's about showing everyone there's a better way! [pause] When you execute someone in the shadows, you become the very tyranny people fear.

Character 2: [quietly] I found seven bodies in his basement last week. [very quietly] Kids who asked too many questions about where the food shipments went. Tell me again about your moral high ground.

Character 1: [shaky voice] I didn't know about the children. [long pause] But this changes nothing about our methods—if anything, exposing that would have destroyed his entire faction's credibility forever.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Forever is a luxury dead children don't have. [firmly] I've stopped sixteen shipments from being diverted, saved three villages from starvation, all while you were filing paperwork and making speeches.

Character 1: [defensively] Those speeches inspire thousands to resist! [angrily] Without public support, without legitimacy, we're just another group of thugs fighting over scraps of power. People need hope, not more bodies in the street.

Character 2: [laughs bitterly] Hope doesn't fill empty stomachs or stop bullets. [pause] I've watched your peaceful protests get massacred while government officials count their bribes. At least my way gets results.

Character 1: [empathetically] I know you've lost people too. [softly] But every time you kill without trial, without evidence presented publicly, you give the regime ammunition to paint all of us as terrorists.

Character 2: [harshly] They already call us terrorists! [exhales] The only difference is I make them check under their beds at night, wondering if their crimes have finally caught up with them.

Character 1: [firmly] And what happens when we win? [pause] When the war is over and all we've taught people is that power comes from fear and execution? We'll just create another dictatorship with different faces.

Character 2: [unpredictably soft] Maybe you're right about the future. [suddenly harsh] But I'm dealing with today, and today another official is planning to poison the water supply in Sector 7. Should I wait for your committee to vote on it?

Character 1: The Sector 7 threat—how do you even know about that? We just intercepted those communications two hours ago.

Character 2: Because unlike you, I don't wait for information to come through proper channels. [pause] His assistant has been feeding me intel for months, terrified but willing to help after what she saw.

Character 1: [slowly] If you have an inside source, we could use that to document everything, build an airtight case that brings down the entire chemical weapons program. [pleading] Work with us just this once.

Character 2: [considering] You have forty-eight hours before that poison ships. [firmly] If your way hasn't stopped it by then, I handle it mine. [pause] And this time, I won't just stop at the official giving orders.
