=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [friendly] तो आप Westbrook High में teacher हैं? [curious] मैं वहीं से पढ़ा हूँ actually, करीब बारह साल पहले graduate किया था, हालांकि मेरे छोटे भाई Danny को अपने junior year में drop out करना पड़ा था।

Character 2 [mix]: अच्छा सच में? मैं वहाँ करीब पंद्रह साल से हूँ, AP Chemistry पढ़ाता हूँ। [relaxed] आपके कंधों में काफी tension है, पूरे दिन खड़े रहने से होगी शायद।

Character 1 [mix]: [slowly] Danny Morrison, यह नाम याद है क्या? [firmer pressure] वो 2016 में आपकी chemistry class में था, जिसे आपने fail कर दिया था even though he was only two points away from passing.

Character 2 [mix]: [confused] Morrison? [pause] अरे हाँ, याद आया—होशियार बच्चा था लेकिन उसने final exam ही miss कर दिया था, makeup test के बारे में बात करने भी नहीं आया था।

Character 1 [mix]: [bitter] वो उस दिन hospital में था, हमारी माँ cancer से मर रही थी। [angrily] उसने आपको तीन emails भेजे थे, पूरी situation explain की थी, and you never responded to a single one.

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] मुझे वो emails कभी मिले ही नहीं! [quickly] उस वक्त school का spam filter student messages को block कर देता था, I would have absolutely given him an incomplete instead of failing him.

Character 1 [mix]: [coldly] उसने मुझे sent folder दिखाया था, तीनों emails successfully deliver हुए थे। [pressing harder] आपको बस एक और struggling kid की परवाह नहीं थी, wrong side of town से जो आया था।

Character 2 [mix]: [anxious] अब थोड़ा दर्द होने लगा है—क्या आप pressure कम कर सकते हैं? [nervously] देखिए, मुझे सच में वो emails याद नहीं हैं, उस साल मेरे पास 150 से ज्यादा students थे।

Character 1 [mix]: [sarcastically] एक सौ पचास students, बिलकुल, कितना आसान है ना उस एक को भूल जाना whose entire future depended on passing your class. [exhales] माँ के जाने के बाद वो कभी school वापस नहीं गया, कहता था कोई फायदा नहीं है।

Character 2 [mix]: [regretful] हे भगवान, मुझे बहुत अफसोस है, मुझे आपकी माँ के बारे में पता ही नहीं था। [very quietly] अगर मैं वापस जाकर चीजें बदल सकता, believe me, I would in a heartbeat.

Character 1 [mix]: [shaky voice] Danny अब construction का काम करता है, अच्छे पैसे कमाता है लेकिन वो हमेशा doctor बनना चाहता था। [bitterly] कितना अजीब है ना, एक failed class सब कुछ बदल देती है।

Character 2 [mix]: [upset] प्लीज, आपको समझना होगा, उस साल administration grade inflation पर सख्ती कर रही थी। [pleading] वो हर incomplete को monitor कर रहे थे, threatening our contracts if we were too lenient.

Character 1 [mix]: [very quietly] बस चुप रहिए।

Character 2 [mix]: [whispering] मैं हर उस student की list रखता हूँ जिसे मैंने fail किया है, सोचता रहता हूँ कि क्या मैंने सही किया था। Danny Morrison उस list में है। [pause] सात साल से है।

Character 1 [mix]: [furious] आप list रखते हैं? [loudly] जैसे किसी trophy collection की तरह, lives you've derailed? यह सुनकर बेहतर feel करना चाहिए मुझे?

Character 2 [mix]: [crying while speaking] नहीं, बिलकुल ऐसा नहीं है—यह मेरी failures का reminder है, as a teacher. [sniffling] मैं हर semester इसे देखता हूँ, याद रखने के लिए कि grades सिर्फ numbers नहीं हैं, they're people's futures.

Character 1 [mix]: [exhausted] आपका घंटा पूरा हो गया है, Mrs. Chen। [firmly] मैं आपका massage therapist नहीं रह सकता, receptionist आपका session refund कर देगी और किसी और को ढूंढने में मदद करेगी।

Character 2 [mix]: रुकिए, please—क्या आप मुझे Danny का contact दे सकते हैं? [desperately] मैं जानता हूँ कि सात साल देर हो चुकी है, but I could write a letter to the school board, उसकी GED में मदद कर सकता हूँ, maybe even a recommendation for community college.

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] वो आपसे बात नहीं करना चाहेगा, he's moved on with his life. [sighs] लेकिन मैं उससे पूछूंगा—कोई उम्मीद मत रखिएगा though, कुछ घाव भरते नहीं हैं just because someone finally feels guilty.

Character 2 [mix]: [very sincerely] मैं पूरी तरह समझता हूँ, और शुक्रिया कि आप consider कर रहे हैं। [whispering] मुझे अफसोस है कि मैंने उसे fail किया, और मुझे अफसोस है कि मैंने आपको भी fail किया, as his sister who had to watch him give up on his dreams.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [friendly] So you're a teacher at Westbrook High? [curious] That's where I went actually, graduated about twelve years ago, though my little brother Danny had to drop out his junior year.

Character 2: Oh really? I've been there about fifteen years now, teaching AP Chemistry. [relaxed] The tension in your shoulders is pretty intense, must be from standing all day.

Character 1: [slowly] Danny Morrison, that name ring any bells? [firmer pressure] He was in your chemistry class in 2016, the one you failed even though he was only two points away from passing.

Character 2: [confused] Morrison? [pause] Wait, I remember him—bright kid but he missed the final exam completely, wouldn't even come talk to me about a makeup test.

Character 1: [bitter] He was in the hospital that day with our mom who was dying of cancer. [angrily] He sent you three emails explaining the situation and you never responded to a single one.

Character 2: [defensive] I never got those emails! [quickly] The school's spam filter was notorious for blocking student messages back then, I would have absolutely given him an incomplete instead of failing him.

Character 1: [coldly] He showed me the sent folder, all three emails delivered successfully. [pressing harder] You just didn't care enough about one more struggling kid from the wrong side of town.

Character 2: [anxious] That's starting to hurt a bit—could you ease up? [nervously] Look, I genuinely don't remember seeing those emails, I had over 150 students that year.

Character 1: [sarcastically] One hundred and fifty students, right, so easy to lose track of the one whose entire future depended on passing your class. [exhales] He never went back to school after Mom died, said there was no point.

Character 2: [regretful] Oh God, I'm so sorry, I had no idea about your mother. [very quietly] If I could go back and change things, believe me, I would in a heartbeat.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Danny works construction now, makes decent money but he always wanted to be a doctor. [bitterly] Funny how one failed class can change everything, isn't it?

Character 2: [upset] Please, you have to understand, the administration was cracking down on grade inflation that year. [pleading] They were monitoring every incomplete we gave out, threatening our contracts if we were too lenient.

Character 1: [very quietly] Just be quiet.

Character 2: [whispering] I keep a list of every student I've failed over the years, wondering if I made the right calls. Danny Morrison is on that list. [pause] Has been for seven years.

Character 1: [furious] You keep a list? [loudly] Like some kind of trophy collection of lives you've derailed? That's supposed to make this better somehow?

Character 2: [crying while speaking] No, it's not like that at all—it's a reminder of my failures as a teacher. [sniffling] I look at it every semester to remind myself that grades aren't just numbers, they're people's futures.

Character 1: [exhausted] Your hour's up, Mrs. Chen. [firmly] I can't continue being your massage therapist, I'll have the receptionist refund your session and help you find someone else.

Character 2: Wait, please—could you give me Danny's contact information? [desperately] I know it's seven years too late, but I could write a letter to the school board, help him get his GED, maybe even a recommendation for community college.

Character 1: [hesitantly] He won't want to hear from you, he's moved on with his life. [sighs] But I'll ask him—don't expect anything though, some wounds don't heal just because someone finally feels guilty.

Character 2: [very sincerely] I understand completely, and thank you for even considering it. [whispering] I'm sorry I failed him, and I'm sorry I failed you as his sister who had to watch him give up on his dreams.
