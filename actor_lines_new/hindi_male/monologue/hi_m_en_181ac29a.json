Twenty-three years drilling balls, and I've never felt pressure like that. [pause] His left hand was gone from the elbow down, right leg barely functional. And he's asking me if I can, um... if I can make it work somehow. [passionately] Of course I can make it work! That's what we do, right? We figure it out. [excited] So I'm measuring his span with the prosthetic, calculating the weight distribution completely different than anything I've done before. Had to offset the thumb hole by almost an inch, drill the fingers at this crazy angle to compensate for his grip strength. [chuckle] Three weeks of adjustments, probably drilled six different balls trying to get it perfect. [slowly] And then yesterday, he threw his first strike in four years. [pause] Just... the sound he made, this kind of, um, this half-laugh, half-sob thing. [very quietly] Said he felt like himself again. [empathetically] That's why I do this job, you know? Not for the league players or the pros. For moments like that. When the ball fits so perfectly it's like giving someone a piece of themselves back."
