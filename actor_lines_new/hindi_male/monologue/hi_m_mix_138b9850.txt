=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [bitter] They offered me partner today. Partner at 32—मतलब schedule से पाँच साल पहले? [chuckle] Mom would've been so proud. [pause] वो हमेशा कहती थी कि मैं बहुत बड़ा आदमी बनूँगा, पता है? [very quietly] Too bad she's not returning my calls anymore. [clearing throat] The signing bonus alone is more than Dad made in three years. [sarcastic] लेकिन किसको चाहिए family dinners जब board meetings हैं, है ना? [sigh] Sarah took the kids to her mother's last week. [shaky voice] कहती है कि अब वो मेरे पहले प्यार से compete नहीं कर सकती—office से। [laugh] That's funny, right? क्योंकि मैं तो उनके लिए कर रहा था, हमारे लिए, हमारे future के लिए। [frustrated] Except now there is no "us" anymore, और future में बस... मैं हूँ। उस corner office में। [very sad] With the view I always wanted. [mumbling] घर अब बिल्कुल खाली लगता है। [anxious] I keep buying things to fill it—नयी गाड़ी, नयी घड़ी, सब कुछ नया—लेकिन फिर भी बस... सन्नाटा है। [crying while speaking] I got everything I worked for. सब कुछ जो मुझे लगता था कि important है। [very melancholic] And I've never felt more alone in my entire life. [whispering] कमाल की जीत है ना?


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [bitter] They offered me partner today. Partner at thirty-two—that's what, five years ahead of schedule? [chuckle] Mom would've been so proud. [pause] She always said I'd make it big, you know? [very quietly] Too bad she's not returning my calls anymore. [clearing throat] The signing bonus alone is more than Dad made in three years. [sarcastic] But hey, who needs family dinners when you've got board meetings, right? [sigh] Sarah took the kids to her mother's last week. [shaky voice] Said she couldn't compete with my first love anymore—the office. [laugh] That's funny, right? Because I was doing it for them, for us, for our future. [frustrated] Except now there is no "us" and the future is just... me. In that corner office. [very sad] With the view I always wanted. [mumbling] The house feels so empty now. [anxious] I keep buying things to fill it—new car, new watch, new everything—but it's still just... quiet. [crying while speaking] I got everything I worked for. Everything I thought mattered. [very melancholic] And I've never felt more alone in my entire life. [whispering] Some victory, huh?
