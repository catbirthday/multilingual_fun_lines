Subject: Finally standing up to your abusive boss but knowing you'll probably lose your job tomorrow

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [shaky voice] I did it. I actually... wow, I actually told him off. Twenty minutes ago I was standing there and he was doing his usual thing, you know, belittling me in front of everyone, and something just... snapped. [laugh] God, the look on his face when I said "I'm done being your punching bag." Like nobody had ever talked back to him before. Which, I mean, probably nobody has. [confidently] And you know what? It felt incredible. For once I didn't just stand there and take it. [anxious] But now I'm sitting in my car and it's like... oh shit. What did I just do? He's definitely going to fire me tomorrow. Or maybe not even tomorrow, maybe he'll just, um, send me an email tonight. [bitter] "Your services are no longer required," that's how he'll phrase it. Real professional-like. [hesitantly] I mean, I have some savings but... oof, not enough for more than maybe two months? And the job market is, er, not exactly great right now. [sigh] My hands are still shaking. Look at them. [very quietly] What if I can't find another job? What if he, like, blacklists me somehow? [relieved] But honestly? Even if all that happens... at least I'm not going home feeling like garbage tonight. [chuckle] For once, he's probably the one replaying the conversation, not me.
