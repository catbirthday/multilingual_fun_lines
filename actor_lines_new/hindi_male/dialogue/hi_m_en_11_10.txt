Character 1 [en]: Did you see what happened with the server crash yesterday?

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Oh god yes, total nightmare. The whole database went down for like, what, three hours? I was literally scrambling trying to, um, recover the backup files before anyone noticed.

Character 1 [en]: How much data did we lose?

Character 2 [en]: [furious] We lost everything from the past week because someone—and I'm not naming names but we all know who—forgot to run the automated backups! Like, that's literally the one job they had!

Character 1 [en]: [shy] Was it... was it me? I thought I set those up correctly.

Character 2 [en]: No no, not you! It was, uh, Derek from IT who was supposed to verify the backup scripts were actually running, not just scheduled.

Character 1 [en]: Oh thank god. I was panicking.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah, I mean, your setup was fine. The scripts were there, they just weren't, er, actually executing because of some permission issue that Derek never bothered to check.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] So... what happens to Derek now?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? Probably nothing, which is, oof, frustrating. Management will just make him sit through some training and call it a day.

Character 1 [en]: That's it? For losing a week of data?

Character 2 [en]: Right? It's ridiculous. But here's the thing—they can't really fire him because, um, he's the only one who knows how half our legacy systems work.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] I heard he's been interviewing at other companies.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, wouldn't surprise me. He probably knows his days are numbered here anyway, so he's, you know, getting ahead of it.

Character 1 [en]: Should we be worried?

Character 2 [en]: Absolutely. If he leaves before documenting those systems, we're basically screwed. Like, no one else knows how the payment gateway integration works.

Character 1 [en]: Can't we make him document everything now?

Character 2 [en]: Ha! We've been trying for months. He keeps saying he's "too busy" but really he's just, er, protecting his job security, you know?

Character 1 [en]: This is such a mess.

Character 2 [en]: Yep. Welcome to tech, where everything's held together with duct tape and, uh, one guy's tribal knowledge that he refuses to share.
