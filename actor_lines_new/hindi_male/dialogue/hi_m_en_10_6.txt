Character 1 [en]: So what do you think about Musk's whole Mars colony thing?

Character 2 [en]: Honestly? It's both brilliant and completely insane at the same time. We're talking about establishing a self-sustaining city on a planet where the average temperature is negative eighty degrees Fahrenheit and there's basically no atmosphere to breathe.

Character 1 [en]: But you think it's actually possible?

Character 2 [en]: The technology exists, that's not really the issue. The real question is whether humans can psychologically handle being trapped in metal tubes for seven months just to get there, then living underground forever because the radiation would cook you on the surface.

Character 1 [en]: Seven months seems like nothing compared to living there permanently.

Character 2 [en]: Right? And here's the thing nobody talks about—you can't just come back if you don't like it. The launch windows only align every twenty-six months, and that's assuming there's even a return rocket waiting for you.

Character 1 [en]: Do you follow the rover missions at all?

Character 2 [en]: Perseverance is my favorite actually. That little robot is literally collecting rock samples right now that might contain evidence of ancient Martian life, just sitting there in tubes waiting for us to figure out how to bring them home.

Character 1 [en]: [shy] I... I actually named my cat Perseverance.

Character 2 [en]: [laugh hard] That's amazing! Does your cat also drill into things and leave samples everywhere? Because that would be perfect.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] She does knock everything off my desk systematically, so kind of similar.

Character 2 [en]: See, that's basically the same mission profile. Though I bet your cat doesn't cost two point seven billion dollars to maintain—NASA's budget for these things is absolutely mind-blowing when you think about it.

Character 1 [en]: What's the most impressive thing we've learned from Mars so far?

Character 2 [en]: The water, definitely the water. We've found ancient river deltas, polar ice caps, and there's probably liquid water underneath the surface right now—that changes everything about potential colonization.

Character 1 [en]: Could we actually grow food there?

Character 2 [en]: [yawn] In theory, yes, with the right setup. The soil has perchlorates that would kill you, but if you wash those out and add nutrients, you could grow potatoes just like in that movie—though realistically you'd probably start with algae and work your way up.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] I love that we're seriously planning space farming now!

Character 2 [en]: The craziest part is that Mars gets about forty-three percent of Earth's sunlight, which is actually enough for photosynthesis. We could have greenhouses with special UV protection, growing tomatoes while dust storms rage outside for months at a time.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] So we wouldn't just be eating freeze-dried packets forever.

Character 2 [en]: Eventually no, but the first crews are definitely eating space food for years. Once we get manufacturing going though, we could have actual Martian cuisine developing—imagine being the first chef to create a completely new planetary food culture.
