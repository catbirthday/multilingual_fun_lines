=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So I'm—wait, let me just—I think my billing's off? Kind of confused here.

Customer Support: Okay let me, um, pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the email you used?

Customer: Oh yeah. It's probably under—no wait. sarah.chen at gmail.

Customer Support: Got it, er, I see your account here. Account ID SC-4829-B7. So you're on our monthly plan that started October 15th, which means your next charge will be, uh, November 15th.

Customer: Right but. I got charged yesterday? Sort of weird timing.

Customer Support: Hmm, let me check that... Oh I see what happened. That charge from October 31st was actually for your previous cycle, um, September 15th to October 15th. Sometimes the processing takes 7 to 10 days to actually hit your card.

Customer: Wait so—I mean—that's last month? Not this month?

Customer Support: Exactly, yeah. That $47.99 charge was for September's service. Your October charge, er, won't process until around November 22nd or 23rd, give or take.

Customer: God that's. Confusing. Sorry, I know it's not your fault.

Customer Support: No no, I totally get it. Honestly the, uh, the billing system is kind of a pain. What I usually tell people is just look at the service dates on your statement—those are way more helpful than the charge dates.

Customer: You probably get this question. Like. All the time.

Customer Support: Oh constantly. Er, literally had three calls about it just this morning. But hey, better to ask than be confused about your money, right?

Customer: Can I maybe—actually no—can you send me something? With the dates?

Customer Support: Sure thing, um, I'll email you a billing schedule right now. Should hit your inbox in about 2 minutes. Reference number is BILL-20241101-SC4829 if you need it for anything.

Customer: You're great. I bet people don't say that enough.

Customer Support: Aw, that's really kind of you. Okay so, er, just to recap—you'll see charges about a week after each cycle ends, not when it starts. Makes sense?

Customer: Yeah no I—I think I got it. Sort of backwards but. Okay.

Customer Support: Right right. And if you want to switch to, uh, pay-at-start instead of pay-at-end, I can do that. Takes about 24 hours to process though.

Customer: Nah. I'll probably just. Forget again. But thanks.

Customer Support: Ha, well, er, at least now you know to check those service dates. Anything else I can help with today? Average hold time's only 3 minutes right now if you need to call back later.
