Scenario: asking about a class action settlement they received notice for

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I got this notice. Class action. You probably sent thousands out wrong.

Customer Support: Oh! Oh! A settlement notice, yes yes yes, let me—let me pull that right up for you. What's the case number on the notice you received? Should be like CAL-2024 something?

Customer: CAL-2024-889TX. My attorney says I should've heard months ago.

Customer Support: CAL-2024-889TX, perfect perfect. Okay so—so this is actually really interesting, this is the data breach settlement from last year, and um, you're showing as eligible for tier 2 compensation which is $147.50!

Customer: Tier 2? That's it? I think there's been some mistake here.

Customer Support: Hmm, let me—let me dig deeper into this. Your account shows... oh wait wait wait, I see what's happening! You actually have TWO claims, the second one is pending review under reference SR-90412-B.

Customer: Two claims. Right. So what's the holdup exactly?

Customer Support: So the the second claim, it needs identity verification, just—just standard procedure but I can actually handle that right now if you have like thirty seconds?

Customer: Fine. But this better not take long. I've got calls.

Customer Support: Absolutely absolutely! Super quick, I promise. Can you verify the last four of your social? Just need to match it to what's in claim SR-90412-B.

Customer: 7829. This is probably why everything's delayed, your system.

Customer Support: 7829, yep yep that matches! Oh this is—this is great actually, your second claim qualifies for tier 1, which is $450.00, so combined you're looking at $597.50 total!

Customer: Oh. Well. That's... that's sort of more reasonable I guess.

Customer Support: Right? Right? And here's the—here's the really good news, both payments can be expedited! Instead of waiting 60-90 days, we can process them together with code FASTTRACK-2X and you'll have them in 10 business days.

Customer: Ten days. Okay. But if this doesn't arrive, I'm calling legal.

Customer Support: Totally totally understand! I'm—I'm putting a priority flag on both claims right now, reference numbers PY-88291-A and PY-88291-B, and honestly our settlement team is really good about these expedited ones.

Customer: Fine. Send confirmation to my email. The premium account one.

Customer Support: Of course of course! Sending to the email ending in @platinumexec.net, correct? Should hit your inbox in—in about two minutes with all the the details and tracking info.

Customer: Good. Next time maybe send the right notice first try.

Customer Support: Absolutely, I—I hear you on that. Oh! Before you go though, I just noticed your account qualifies for our settlement alert service, basically basically any future settlements you're eligible for get flagged immediately, want me to—to activate that real quick?
