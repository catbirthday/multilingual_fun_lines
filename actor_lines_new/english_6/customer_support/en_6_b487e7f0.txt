=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I'm calling about an unauthorized charge of $289.99 on my statement dated November 15th.

Customer Support: Good afternoon, and thank you for contacting us. I'll be happy to investigate that charge for you. May I please have your account number ending in the last four digits and the merchant name associated with the $289.99 transaction?

Customer: The account ends in 4782. The merchant shows as "Digital Pro Services LLC" which I've never heard of.

Customer Support: Thank you for that information. I'm pulling up your account 4782 now, and I can see the charge from Digital Pro Services LLC posted on November 15th with transaction ID TXN-89432-NPQ. Let me check our merchant database for more details about this vendor.

Customer: I'd appreciate that. I've reviewed all my receipts and I definitely didn't authorize this purchase.

Customer Support: I completely understand your concern. According to our records, Digital Pro Services LLC is registered as merchant code MCC-5734 for computer software sales, and this particular charge originated from IP address 192.168.45.201 in Nevada. Have you made any online software purchases recently?

Customer: Absolutely not. I haven't purchased any software since my antivirus renewal in August.

Customer Support: Thank you for clarifying. I'm now initiating a formal dispute under case number DSP-2024-11-8975. I'll need to document a few additional details to strengthen your claim and ensure we process this within the standard 5-7 business day timeframe.

Customer: Certainly. What specific information do you need from me to move this forward?

Customer Support: First, I need to verify that you have possession of your physical card ending in 4782. Second, can you confirm whether anyone else authorized on your account might have made this purchase?

Customer: I have my card right here with me. And no, I'm the sole authorized user on this account.

Customer Support: Perfect. I've noted that in your file under reference code RFC-4782-A. Now, as part of our standard fraud prevention protocol FP-2024-Q4, I'm going to issue you a provisional credit while we investigate. You should see the $289.99 credited back within 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: That's excellent. Will I need to get a new card issued as a precaution?

Customer Support: That's a prudent question. Since this appears to be an isolated incident and your physical card is secure, a replacement isn't mandatory. However, I can certainly arrange for a new card with expedited shipping via our carrier service UPS-2DAY if you'd prefer that additional security measure.

Customer: I think I'd feel more comfortable with a new card. How quickly can you get that to me?

Customer Support: Absolutely, I'll process that immediately. Your new card will be generated with number ending 5891 and shipped today before our 4:00 PM cutoff. You'll receive it within two business days with tracking number starting with 1Z999AA. Your current card will remain active until you activate the new one.

Customer: Perfect. Can you also confirm what happens if your investigation finds this was indeed fraudulent?

Customer Support: Certainly. Once our fraud department completes their investigation under case DSP-2024-11-8975, if the charge is confirmed as unauthorized, the provisional credit becomes permanent. You'll receive a resolution letter via secure message in your online portal, typically within 10 business days, confirming the final disposition.

Customer: I appreciate your thorough assistance today. You've addressed all my concerns professionally.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. I've sent a confirmation email summarizing everything we've discussed today, including your case number DSP-2024-11-8975 and new card details. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your account today?
