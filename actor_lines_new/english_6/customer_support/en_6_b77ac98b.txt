=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look. I need this refund. Today. Not tomorrow.

Customer Support: Right, I completely understand the urgency here, especially during your busy season. Let me pull up your account with Premier Flour Supply, account number PFS-4492-N.

Customer: *exhale* Three weddings this weekend. Can't just... find new supplier overnight.

Customer Support: Oh wow, three weddings, that's... that's intense. So I'm seeing here that you submitted refund request RF-20847 on June 22nd for the damaged shipment, and it looks like it's been stuck in processing.

Customer: Stuck. Of course it's stuck. Why wouldn't it be stuck.

Customer Support: I know, I know, this is the last thing you need right now. The system shows... um... let me find the right... it's showing a verification hold, basically they needed additional documentation about the damage.

Customer: *sharp inhale* They have photos. Sent them. June 23rd.

Customer Support: Okay okay, yes, I can see the photos were received, batch upload ID IMG-7734-B, but there's a note here that says they need... they need the delivery driver's incident number from that day.

Customer: Nobody said anything about... *exhale* Fine. What else.

Customer Support: Actually, you know what? I'm going to—I'm going to escalate this directly to the refund department, case escalation number ESC-9012, because three weeks is just too long for a basic damage claim.

Customer: You can actually do that? Not just... transfer me around?

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: *exhale* Okay. That's... better than nothing I guess.

Customer Support: So what I'm doing is... uh... marking this as time-sensitive business impact, priority code P2, and linking it to your upcoming orders for July 6th, 7th, and 8th, which should get someone on this within four hours.

Customer: Four hours. Not three weeks. That's actually... helpful.

Customer Support: Got it.

Customer: Wait. You see my upcoming orders?

Customer Support: Yeah, I can see you've got scheduled deliveries, order numbers ORD-8956-A, ORD-8957-A, and ORD-8958-A, all marked for early morning delivery, and honestly that's why I want to get this resolved, because you're clearly a regular customer who shouldn't be dealing with this.

Customer: *exhale* Yeah. Five years. Never had issues until now.

Customer Support: That's exactly what I'm putting in the escalation notes, customer since 2019, account value tier Gold, zero previous complaints, and I'm... I'm also adding my direct extension, 4782, so if they don't contact you by end of day, call me back directly.
