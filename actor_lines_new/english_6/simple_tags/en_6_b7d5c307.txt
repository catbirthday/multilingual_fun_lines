Scenario: A ghost haunting a marina discovers the night-shift repair tech is the only living person who can see them, and desperately tries to communicate urgent information about their death.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [anxiously] Please don't run away this time—I know you can see me standing here by the Mercury engine, and I desperately need you to listen to what I'm trying to tell you.

Character 2: [shaky voice] This can't be happening again. [exhales] Look, I already told you last night, I fix boat motors, not whatever supernatural problem you've got going on here.

Character 1: [pleading] Just five minutes!

Character 2: [frustrated] Five minutes of what?

Character 1: [quickly] There's something wrong with the boat in slip seventeen—the one with the blue hull and the new Yamaha four-stroke. [urgently] The owner doesn't know the fuel line has a hairline crack that's going to fail catastrophically.

Character 2: [confused] How could you possibly know about a hairline crack in a fuel line? [nervously] Dead people don't exactly stay current on marine engine maintenance procedures, do they?

Character 1: [bitter] Because I'm the one who installed that fuel line three weeks before my accident. [quietly] I was rushing the job, trying to finish before the storm came in, and I knew something felt wrong but I signed off anyway.

Character 2: [slowly] Wait, you're saying you were a tech here at the marina? [gasps] Oh God, you're Jimmy Castellano—the guy who went overboard during Hurricane Patricia last month.

Character 1: [relieved] Yes! Finally someone remembers me as more than just another drowning statistic. [desperately] That family with the three kids is taking that boat out tomorrow morning for a twelve-hour fishing trip.

Character 2: I can't just walk up to a customer and tell them their recently serviced engine is dangerous because a ghost warned me about it. [sighs] They'll think I'm trying to scam them for unnecessary repairs.

Character 1: [firmly] Then don't tell them I warned you—just check the line yourself right now while nobody's around. [pleading] Use the inspection camera, run it along the connection point near the primer bulb.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Even if I find something, how do I explain randomly inspecting a boat that wasn't scheduled for service? [anxiously] My supervisor already thinks I'm losing it after I mentioned seeing someone in the workshop after hours.

Character 1: [passionately] Tell them you noticed a fuel smell while walking past, anything! [loudly] Three kids under ten years old—do you really want their deaths on your conscience because you were worried about looking crazy?

Character 2: [defensive] That's not fair, man. [exhales] You're asking me to risk my job, my reputation, everything I've worked for based on the word of someone who technically doesn't exist anymore.

Character 1: [very quietly] I know what I'm asking seems impossible. [sadly] But I can't move on, can't rest, knowing that my last mistake as a living person might kill an entire family.

Character 2: [softly] Jesus, Jimmy. [pause] Alright, I'll grab my inspection kit and check the boat, but if this is some kind of supernatural prank, I'm never working night shifts again.

Character 1: [gratefully] Thank you—God, thank you so much. [urgently] Check the starboard side connection first, about six inches from where it connects to the engine block, and look for discoloration in the line.

Character 2: [resigned] I must be completely insane, taking repair advice from a dead marine tech. [chuckles] But I guess if you're real enough to know about specific fuel line placements, maybe you're real enough to be right.

Character 1: [warmly] When you find it, and you will find it, just leave a note saying you did a routine inspection. [very quietly] Maybe then I can finally stop haunting this place and actually rest.

Character 2: [determined] Fine, let's go check your boat. [nervously] But after this, you've got to promise me you'll stop appearing while I'm trying to rebuild carburetors—nearly gave me a heart attack yesterday.
