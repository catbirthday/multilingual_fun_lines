=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] The router's in the corner behind the desk, next to the—wait. [pause] Tommy? Is that really you after all these years?

Character 2: [quietly] Yeah, it's me. [clears throat] I saw your name on the work order but figured there had to be a thousand other David Millers in the city.

Character 1: [bitter] Ten years, Tommy. [slowly] Ten years without a single word after Dad's company went under and you just vanished into thin air.

Character 2: [defensive] You went to Wharton.

Character 1: [frustrated] So what? [loudly] That doesn't mean you had to disappear completely, cut everyone off, leave Mom wondering if you were even alive!

Character 2: [firmly] You got the scholarship, the MBA, the whole golden ticket out while I stayed and watched everything burn. [pause] Different choices, different lives.

Character 1: I work in leveraged buyouts now, actually. The irony isn't lost on me—I basically do what those vultures did to Dad's business.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Must pay well, judging by this penthouse. [sighs] Three million dollar view of Central Park, custom Italian marble, the whole nine yards.

Character 1: [quietly] It does.

Character 2: [warmly] I like the cable work, honestly. [chuckles] Nobody's life gets destroyed when I install their internet, nobody loses their pension when I run fiber optic lines.

Character 1: [empathetically] Tommy, listen—

Character 2: [quickly] Look, I've got four more installations today and this rain's going to make traffic hell. [clearing throat] Your speeds should triple once I finish the upgrade.

Character 1: [desperately] Don't leave yet.

Character 2: [hesitantly] David, we're different people now. [slowly] You restructure companies, I fix cable boxes, and maybe that's exactly how it should be.

Character 1: [passionately] But you're still my brother! [exhales] That has to count for something after all this time, after everything that happened.

Character 2: [very quietly] Does Mom still make that terrible meatloaf every Sunday? [laughs] The one with the ketchup glaze that we pretended to love?

Character 1: [smiling speaking] Every single Sunday, and it's somehow gotten worse. [pause] She'd cry if she knew you were here, if she knew you were okay.

Character 2: I send her flowers every birthday, no card, just white roses from that shop on Lexington she always loved. [trails off]

Character 1: She knows they're from you. She keeps every single one pressed in Dad's old ledger books.

Character 2: [trembling] I should go finish the installation. [long pause] But maybe we could grab a beer sometime, talk about things that don't matter as much.
