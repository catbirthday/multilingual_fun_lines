Scenario: A self-starter entrepreneur participates in a focus group for their own startup's product while trying to remain anonymous as the moderator unknowingly critiques their life's work.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] So, um, I signed up for this focus group because I'm really interested in, you know, sustainable packaging solutions and I heard you were testing some new product concepts today. [clears throat] Is it okay if I sit here?

Character 2: [formally] Welcome, please take any seat you'd like, and we'll get started once everyone arrives. [warmly] I see from your intake form that you're quite passionate about environmental issues, which is perfect for today's discussion actually.

Character 1: [curious] Yeah, I mean, I've been following this space for a while now, and honestly, some of these new startups are doing incredible work with, uh, biodegradable materials that nobody thought were possible even five years ago.

Character 2: [confidently] That's exactly the kind of enthusiasm we need, though I should warn you that we'll be looking at some products today that might not meet your expectations. [pause] The company we're evaluating claims to be revolutionary but, well, let's just see what the group thinks.

Character 1: [defensive] Revolutionary how exactly?

Character 2: [condescending] They're calling it 'EcoWrap' and supposedly it dissolves completely in water within thirty days, but frankly, between you and me, I've seen dozens of these claims over my fifteen years doing this. [sighs] Most turn out to be greenwashing.

Character 1: [frustrated] Wait, that's not fair.

Character 2: [stern] Not fair?

Character 1: [quickly] I just mean, um, shouldn't we actually examine the product before dismissing it? Like, what if they've actually figured out something new with the polymer chains or, err, the binding agents they're using?

Character 2: [calmly] Of course we'll examine it thoroughly, that's what we're here for, but I'm simply setting realistic expectations based on extensive experience. [chuckles] You seem quite invested in defending a product you haven't even seen yet.

Character 1: [hesitantly] It's just that I know how hard it is to—[pause] I mean, I imagine how difficult it must be for startups to break through when everyone's so skeptical from the start, you know?

Character 2: [patiently] Skepticism is healthy in this industry, especially when companies make bold claims about solving the plastic crisis. [firmly] Our job here is to protect consumers from false promises, not to cheerlead for every startup with a dream.

Character 1: [shaky voice] But what if they spent three years perfecting this formula? [quietly] What if they mortgaged their house and worked eighteen-hour days because they actually believe in making a difference?

Character 2: [confused] That's oddly specific. [pause] Do you happen to know someone at this company or—

Character 1: [anxiously] No, no, I just, umm, I read an article about them maybe, or something similar anyway, and it mentioned how much they'd sacrificed to get this far. [exhales] Sorry, I'm getting too emotional about this.

Character 2: [suspiciously] An article, hmm? [slowly] You know, in all my years doing this, I've learned to spot when someone has more than a casual interest in the product we're testing.

Character 1: Look, can we just evaluate it fairly? Please?

Character 2: [warmly] Actually, your passion is exactly what makes focus groups valuable, even if you do have some connection to this product. [chuckles] The real test will be whether EcoWrap can convince the skeptics, not the believers.

Character 1: [relieved] Thank you for saying that, and I promise I'll try to be objective, it's just, err, when you've seen how much work goes into something like this, it's hard not to root for it to succeed. [sighs]

Character 2: [gently] Well then, let's give your—I mean, let's give this product the thorough, fair evaluation it deserves, shall we? [pause] After all, every revolutionary product started with someone who believed in it enough to defend it to strangers.
