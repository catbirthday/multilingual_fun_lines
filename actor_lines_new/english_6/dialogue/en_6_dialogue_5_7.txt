=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You know what blows my mind? Your kid's speaking three languages and she's what, five? That's like having a superpower.

Character 2: [short pause] She's actually four, but yeah, it still catches me off guard sometimes. She'll switch languages mid-sentence depending on who walks in the room. My mother-in-law thinks it's the most natural thing in the world.

Character 1: Four years old and already more accomplished than most adults I know. What's her secret?

Character 2: No secret really, just constant exposure from birth. Kids don't think about language as something to learn—they just absorb it like they absorb everything else. The brain's doing all this incredible neural pathway construction without any conscious effort.

Character 1: [bored] I spent six years on French and all I remember is how to ask where the library is.

Character 2: That's every American's French experience right there. The problem is we treat language like math—memorize the formula, apply the formula. But language is more like music. You need to feel the rhythm, internalize the patterns, make mistakes without fear.

Character 1: Music. I like that analogy. So what you're saying is I should stop studying Spanish and start living it?

Character 2: Exactly. Find Spanish podcasts about stuff you actually care about. Watch shows without subtitles even if you're lost at first. Your brain will start connecting dots whether you realize it or not.

Character 1: This is why I need you in my life. You make everything sound achievable. What's the hardest language you've tackled?

Character 2: Mandarin nearly broke me. Tones are absolute killers when you grow up with non-tonal languages. I'd say something I thought meant "mother" and apparently be calling someone a horse. The writing system is beautiful but requires memorizing thousands of unique characters.

Character 1: But you stuck with it. That's what I admire about you.

Character 2: Barely. I quit three times before it finally clicked. The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to translate everything and just accepted meanings directly. Once you stop filtering through English, everything speeds up dramatically.

Character 1: See, this is exactly what I needed to hear today. You've just reignited my Spanish dreams.

Character 2: Spanish is actually the perfect choice for English speakers. Lots of cognates, relatively phonetic spelling, and the grammar follows pretty logical patterns. Plus you've got millions of native speakers in the US to practice with.

Character 1: There's this Colombian family that runs the coffee shop near my office. Tomorrow I'm ordering in Spanish.

Character 2: That's brilliant. They'll probably be thrilled. Native speakers are usually incredibly patient with learners, especially when you're making an effort in their language. Just don't be surprised if they immediately switch to English trying to be helpful.

Character 1: [upset] Why do people do that? It completely defeats the purpose of practicing.

Character 2: It's meant kindly but yeah, it's frustrating. The trick is to just keep responding in Spanish even when they switch. Most people get it after a few exchanges and will stick with Spanish if you persist.

Character 1: You're absolutely right. Persistence is everything. Same philosophy that got me through law school.

Character 2: Law school and language learning actually use similar brain regions—pattern recognition, rule application, exception handling. You've already trained your brain for exactly this kind of challenge. Spanish should be a cakewalk compared to constitutional law.
