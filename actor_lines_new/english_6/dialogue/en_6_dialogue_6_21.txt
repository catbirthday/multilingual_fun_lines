Character 1: So you're saying these numbers came to you in a dream?

Character 2: [very excited] Oh my god, yes! Like, it was the most vivid thing—I was floating above this massive spiral of stars and they just kept, um, pulsing these sequences at me. Seventeen, twenty-three, forty-one.

Character 1: [yawn] And you wrote them all down?

Character 2: [mumbling] Every single one, yeah, well, most of them anyway. Had to scramble for a pen at three in the morning, you know how it is. Eight, eight again, then thirty-six.

Character 1: [child-like] Ooh, double eights! That's lucky, right?

Character 2: Mmm, incredibly lucky actually—in numerology that's, uh, infinite abundance basically. The universe doubling down on prosperity, if you will. Let me see here... nineteen, seven, fifty-two.

Character 1: How many people usually show up for these readings?

Character 2: Well, honestly, it varies—sometimes we get like thirty people crammed in here, other times it's just, er, you and maybe two others. Tonight feels special though, I can sense the energy shifting already. Twelve, ninety-nine.

Character 1: Ninety-nine? That's almost a hundred.

Character 2: Right? It's actually super significant because it represents, um, completion that's not quite complete—like you're on the verge of something massive but there's one tiny piece missing. Forty-four, twenty-one, three.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh good, three is my number. I was worried it wouldn't show up.

Character 2: Ahh, see, the universe always provides what we need! Three is, you know, creativity and communication and honestly it's been appearing everywhere lately—I mean, just yesterday I saw it three times before noon.

Character 1: Do you use these for lottery tickets?

Character 2: Ha! People ask me that constantly and, well, sometimes yeah, but it's not really about winning money, you know? It's more about understanding the patterns, the cosmic messages. Sixty-seven, eleven, twenty-nine.

Character 1: Eleven eleven! Make a wish!

Character 2: Exactly! Master number, portal opening, all that good stuff. Though technically it's just one eleven here but, hmm, the energy is definitely similar. Fifteen, eighty-eight, two.

Character 1: Wait, another double eight?

Character 2: I know, right? That's, uh, that's actually really unusual to get two sets of doubled numbers in one reading. The stars are basically screaming abundance at whoever these are meant for.

Character 1: [furious] Are you seriously just making these up as you go?

Character 2: Wh—no! I mean, look, I understand the skepticism but these genuinely came through in meditation, in dreams, in, er, various channeling sessions. Whether you believe in it or not, that's obviously your choice, but I'm not just pulling random numbers out of nowhere.
