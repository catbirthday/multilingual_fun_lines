            "content": "Oh, okay, yeah that's—that's actually really common, you know? Most of my patients have been considering it for, gosh, sometimes a decade before they finally come in. What specifically about your nose bothers you, if you don't mind me asking?"

But look, perception is everything, and if it's affecting your confidence, that's what matters here, not what I or anyone else thinks."

            "content": "No no, I promise I'm not—I mean, being nice is part of bedside manner, sure, but I've turned away plenty of patients who didn't need surgery. Your nose has maybe a slight dorsal hump which, um, we could definitely address if that's what's bothering you, but it's really not as prominent as you might think."

            "content": "Mmm, so rhinoplasty typically runs between eight and fifteen thousand, depending on complexity and whether we're doing, like, functional stuff too—fixing breathing issues, that kind of thing. Insurance sometimes covers the functional part which, uh, can help offset costs a bit."

This isn't emergency surgery, there's no rush here, and frankly, debt stress cancels out any confidence boost you'd get from the procedure."

About five to ten percent of rhinoplasties need some kind of revision, which sounds scary but most of those are, like, tiny adjustments—a little more off here, slightly different angle there. Major complications are genuinely rare, maybe one in two hundred cases, and even then we can usually fix things."

            "content": "[curious] That's... huh, that's actually a fair question that most people are too polite to ask. I had one case about three years ago where the patient developed unexpected scar tissue that, erm, created some asymmetry, but we corrected it with a revision six months later and she's thrilled now."

            "content": "Ohh boy, yeah, that's—that's actually what we call body dysmorphia combined with, frankly, some unethical surgeons who kept operating when they should've said no. Any decent surgeon would recognize those warning signs and refer for psychological evaluation instead of just, you know, taking the money and carving away."

Not officially, but honestly, probably sixty percent of my job is listening to people's insecurities and helping them figure out if surgery will actually address what's really bothering them, or if they're trying to fix something internal with something external, which... well, that never works out the way people hope."
