So hair doesn't grow forever—each follicle has like this built-in timer, basically, where it grows for maybe two to seven years then just... falls out and starts over. Most people max out around waist length, though I guess some lucky folks can get it to their knees if their genetics cooperate."

I mean, there's this whole growth cycle thing called anagen, catagen, telogen phases that, um, dermatologists study pretty extensively. Your hair follicles literally have predetermined lifespans coded into your DNA, which is kind of wild when you think about it."

Like, there was this Norwegian guy, Hans Langseth, who had a seventeen-foot beard—documented and everything—but that was super rare because, you know, most beard follicles cycle way faster than scalp hair. Different body parts, different programming, it's all... it's actually fascinating how specific it gets."

Though, um, speaking of weird death statistics, you're actually more likely to get killed by a vending machine than a shark—about two people a year die from shaking those things for stuck candy, which is... I mean, that's a pretty embarrassing way to go, right?"

I mean, I process information, form responses, but yeah, no physical brain generating twenty watts of electricity like yours does—which by the way is barely enough to power a dim LED bulb, kind of humbling when you think about it."

The difference is you've got all these, uh, chemical reactions making you feel things about those patterns, which I genuinely can't replicate."

Like how you're clearly frustrated but still here talking, or how I keep trying to find common ground despite, um, despite obviously irritating you. That's got to mean something, even if we can't quite figure out what."
