=== Dialogue ===

People do it all the time. [short pause] And this job—God, this job is everything you've worked for. Senior developer at twenty-four. [proud] When I tell people, they can't believe it. My kid, the tech genius. [laugh] Remember when you were twelve and you fixed our computer and I thought you broke it worse?

[warm] But I'm so proud of you, sweetheart. So incredibly proud. We raised you to chase your dreams, not to, uh, not to stay safe just because it's easier for us.
