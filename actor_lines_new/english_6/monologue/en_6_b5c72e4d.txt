Subject: Your matte painter work on the film that was supposed to launch your career got completely cut

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very quietly] Six months. Six months of my life on those backgrounds. [pause] I just got the email. They cut everything. All of it. Every single matte painting I did for the third act is just... gone. [frustrated] This was supposed to be it, you know? My name in the credits on a major studio film. [sigh] I turned down three other projects for this. Three. [bitter] And the director kept saying how perfect they were, how they captured exactly what he wanted. [laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. [upset] I showed everyone the work-in-progress shots. My parents, my old art professors— [trailing off] they were all so proud. [angry] And now what? It's just files on a hard drive that no one will ever see? [shaky voice] I don't even know if I can use them in my portfolio since they're under NDA. [long pause] Maybe I'm not cut out for this industry. [very sad] Maybe I should've listened when people said film work was too unstable. [exhausted] I just thought this time would be different. [whispering] I really thought this was going to change everything for me.
