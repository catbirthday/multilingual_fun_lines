Subject: The stonemason project you spent three years on is being demolished for a parking lot

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very melancholic] Three years. Three fucking years I spent on that wall. Every single stone, I knew where it came from, how it... [sigh] I hand-cut each piece. Fitted them together like, I don't know, like a puzzle that only I could see. And now they're just—they're tearing it down. [bitter] For a parking lot. A parking lot! Can you believe that? 

[quietly] I keep thinking about that corner piece, you know? The one that took me, uhh, two weeks to get right because the grain kept splitting? [pause] That was... that was probably my best work. Ever. And tomorrow morning some guy with a bulldozer who doesn't even—he won't even notice what he's destroying. 

[angry] They called it "progress." Progress! Like we need more asphalt, more spaces for cars to sit and leak oil. [shaky voice] My grandfather taught me this trade. He used to say stones outlive us all, that we're just... we're temporary but the work remains. [very sad] Except it doesn't, does it? Not anymore. Not when someone decides they need, what, forty more parking spaces? 

[exhausted] I don't know if I can do this again. Start something that meaningful knowing it could just... disappear. [trailing off] Maybe I should've been an accountant or something...
