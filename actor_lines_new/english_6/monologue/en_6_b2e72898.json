[pause] But now there's—there's glass everywhere and people are screaming and I can't even see where my friends went. [shaky voice] Someone just shoved a brick in my hand and told me to throw it or I'm part of the problem. What does that even mean? [upset] I came here to protest police brutality, not to become what they say we are. This is exactly what they want, right? For us to look like animals so they can justify everything. [frustrated] But the crowd is pushing and if I try to leave now, I don't know, it feels like... like I'll get trampled or worse. [very quietly] That smoke is getting thicker. [cough] I think—I think those are tear gas canisters coming. [panicking] Oh god, I need to get out. I need to find Sarah and just get out. [shouting] This isn't protest anymore, this is—this is chaos! [sniffle] My mom's going to see this on the news and think I'm one of them. The ones breaking things. [regretful] I just wanted change. I just wanted to be heard. Not this. [very sad] Never this."
