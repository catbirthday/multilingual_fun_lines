[pause] She sat there in her robes and dismantled everything in twenty minutes. [angry] Like it was nothing! Like those witnesses didn't matter, like the forensics team didn't exist, like I just, what, made it all up? [sarcastic] Oh, excuse me, Your Honor, I must have imagined the DNA evidence. My bad. [frustrated] God, I can still see her face when she said it. That little smirk she tried to hide behind her glasses. [quietly] She knew exactly what she was doing. This wasn't about the evidence. [speeding up] Everyone knows the evidence was solid, the jury knew it, the prosecution knew it, hell, even the defense knew we had them. This was about—this was about making a point. [pause] About showing me my place. [exhausted] And the worst part? There's nothing I can do about it. [bitter] She gets to sit up there and play God with people's lives while I have to, um... while I have to go back to that victim's family and explain why the person who destroyed their lives is walking free tomorrow. [very quietly] Three years. All for nothing."
