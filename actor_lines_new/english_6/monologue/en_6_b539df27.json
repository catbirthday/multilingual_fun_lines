[speeding up] Oh my God, they actually chose my stonework for the heroes' memorial. [shaky voice] This is going to stand for, what, hundreds of years? [long pause] \n\n[anxious] I mean, I've been cutting stone for twenty-three years but this is... hmm... this is different. [passionately] These aren't just names I'm carving—these are people who gave everything. [sigh] Their families will come here. [very slowly] Their children, their grandchildren, they'll run their fingers across the letters I cut. \n\n[crying while speaking] My grandfather taught me this craft. [sniffle] He always said stone remembers what we forget. [warm] And now I get to, um... I get to make sure these heroes are remembered. [hesitantly] The weight of it is, honestly, it's terrifying. [pause] What if I mess up a name? [frustrated] No, no, I can't think like that. \n\n[confidently] Every strike of my chisel matters now.
