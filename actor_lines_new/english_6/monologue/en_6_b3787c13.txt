Subject: Your personal injury attorney win just set precedent protecting other families like yours

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] They just called and... we won. [pause] Not just won—we set precedent. [relieved] God, I can't even— [sigh] Three years of depositions and medical records and, and reliving the worst day of our lives over and over, but we did it. [very quietly] Other families won't have to fight like we did. 

[emotional] You know, they kept saying we were being unreasonable, that we should just, um... that we should settle. [bitter] "Take the money and move on," right? [pause] But it was never about the money. [passionately] It was about making sure no other parent has to watch their kid suffer because some company decided safety regulations were, I don't know, optional? 

[crying while speaking] Sarah would've been so proud. [sniffle] She always said we should— [pause] Mmm, sorry. [warm] She used to say if something's wrong, you fix it for everyone, not just yourself. [laugh] Even at seven years old, she got that. 

[exhausted] I'm just so tired but also, er... also somehow energized? [hopeful] Like, this ruling means every single family after us is protected. [very sincerely] That's worth every terrible day in that courtroom. [quietly] Every single one.
