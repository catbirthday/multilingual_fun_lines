Subject: Your lone wolf approach to the project succeeded spectacularly when everyone said collaboration was the only way

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [laughing] God, I still can't believe it actually worked. Everyone was so— [frustrated] "You need a team, you can't do this alone, nobody succeeds in isolation." [pause] And I just kept thinking, like... what if they're wrong? [quietly] What if the problem isn't that I need more voices, but that I need, um, less noise? [excited] And it turns out I was right! [laugh] The whole thing came together because I could just, you know, follow my instincts without having to explain every single decision to five different people. [relieved] No committees, no endless meetings about, uh... about whether we should use blue or slightly darker blue. [chuckle] Just me, working at three in the morning when the ideas were flowing. [confidently] And honestly? I think that's why it succeeded. [thoughtfully] Sometimes you need that singular vision, that, hmm... that clarity you only get when you're not trying to compromise with everyone else's ideas. [proud] They said it was impossible. [pause] They literally said "This will never work without collaboration." [smiling speaking] Well, look who's presenting to the board next week. [triumphantly] Just me. [sigh] Alone. Like I always wanted it.
