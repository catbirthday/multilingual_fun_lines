=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Oh my God. Oh my God, is this—is this real? [very quietly] Two point five million dollars. [pause] I need to sit down. I literally need to— [shaky voice] This can't be right. Let me read it again. "On behalf of the Morrison Foundation, we are pleased to inform you..." [speeding up] Two point five million dollars for unrestricted use. Unrestricted! [laugh] Do you know what this means? [very excited] We can finally fix the roof! And the after-school program—we don't have to cut it! [crying while speaking] All those kids we had to turn away last year because we didn't have space or funding... [sniffle] God, I need to call Sarah. And Marcus. And the board—oh, the board is going to lose their minds. [extremely happy] Five years I've been writing grants, begging for scraps, making impossible choices about which programs to cut. [passionately] And now we can actually do the work! Really do it! [slowly] Not just survive month to month, but actually, um... actually thrive. [deep pitch] I should probably verify this is legitimate before I get too— [laugh loudly] Who am I kidding? I'm already planning everything! [warm] Mom, if you could see this... you always said this work mattered. [very sincerely] You were right.
