Subject: Finally understanding why your stepbrother resented you, just as he's moving across the country

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: God, I just... I just figured it out. [regretful] All these years and it never—I mean, it was right there. [pause] When Dad married your mom, you were what, thirteen? [very quietly] And suddenly there's this eight-year-old kid in your house getting all the attention because I was, um... I was the baby, basically. [bitter] The cute one who needed help with homework while you were just expected to figure everything out yourself. [sigh] And every family vacation, every holiday photo, it was always "make sure we get one with the little one" and you'd just be... standing there. [upset] I kept thinking you hated me because—I don't know, because you were mean or whatever, but you were just a kid too. [shaky voice] A kid who lost half his mom's attention overnight to some, er, some random kid who wasn't even— [pause] And now you're loading that U-Haul and I'm standing here finally getting it when it's, like, ten years too late. [very melancholic] I should've seen how they compared us constantly. "Why can't you be more like your brother?" [frustrated] Jesus, no wonder you couldn't wait to leave. [trailing off] I'm sorry, Marcus. I'm really... yeah.
