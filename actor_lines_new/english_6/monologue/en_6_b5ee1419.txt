Subject: The medical science liaison role you relocated across the country for was eliminated in corporate restructuring after two weeks

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] Two weeks. Two fucking weeks. [pause] I sold my condo. I left everyone I know, packed up my entire life, drove three thousand miles for this "incredible opportunity" and they just— [frustrated] they eliminated the position. Not me, the whole position. [laugh] Like it never even needed to exist. [very quietly] "Corporate restructuring," they said. [mocking] "Nothing personal." [pause] Nothing personal? I have, um... I have boxes I haven't even unpacked yet. [shaky voice] My furniture isn't even here yet. [angry] And they knew! They had to have known this was coming when they hired me. [exhausted] What kind of company does that? [sigh] I turned down two other offers for this. Good ones. Because this was supposed to be— [trailing off] this was the dream role, you know? [very sad] MSL at a major pharma company, finally using my doctorate for something meaningful. [pause] And now I'm just... what? [confused] Unemployed in a city where I don't know a single person? [laugh quietly] My mom's going to have a field day with this. [very meekly] "I told you not to trust them," she'll say. [long pause] God, what am I, um... what am I even supposed to do now?
