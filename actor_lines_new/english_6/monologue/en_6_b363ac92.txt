=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I can't believe I'm actually doing this. [shaky voice] Hey! Leave him alone! [pause] Oh God, they're all looking at me now. [anxious] But you know what? No, I'm not—I'm not backing down this time. [stuttering] I-I see what you're doing every single day and it's, um... it's disgusting. [angry] You think because he's quiet, because he doesn't fight back, that makes it okay? [passionately] Well, newsense—here's a newsflash: some of us are tired of watching you act like you own this place. [loudly] Yeah, I'm talking to you, Jake! [gasp] Did I just say that out loud? Whatever, I'm already in this deep. [confidently] You want to pick on someone? Try picking on someone who'll actually fight back for once. [pause] Or are you too scared to face someone who isn't, hmm, terrified of you? [sarcastic] That's what I thought. [quietly] Come on, let's get out of here. [warmly] Don't listen to them, okay? They're just... they're pathetic. [relieved] Oh my God, I actually did it. [laugh] My hands are literally shaking but I—I stood up to them! [extremely happy] Maybe I'm not as invisible as I thought.
