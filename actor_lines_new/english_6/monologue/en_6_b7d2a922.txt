=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] God, my hands won't stop shaking. [short pause] Four hours. Four hours of moving debris, piece by piece, and then—then we heard them. [very quietly] The little girl was singing. [gasp softly] Can you believe that? Trapped under all that concrete and she's singing some Disney song to keep her baby brother calm. [shaky voice] I've been operating excavators for fifteen years and I've never had to be that precise. Every scoop, every movement—one wrong move and the whole thing could've shifted. [relieved] But we got them out. All four of them. [sniffle] The dad had his arms wrapped around his kids the entire time, even with his shoulder all messed up. [warm] When I pulled that last beam away and saw their faces... [trailing off] I don't know, it's just... [passionately] This is why I do this job, you know? Not for the construction sites or the demolition work—it's for moments like this. [very sincerely] The mom grabbed my hand when they pulled her out, couldn't even speak, just squeezed it so tight. [pause] I should probably, um, call my own family. [crying while speaking] Tell them I love them. [quickly] Because you never know when everything can just come crashing down.
