Scenario: An adult who was abducted and held in soundproof captivity for seven years meets with an audiologist for their first hearing assessment since escape.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [quietly] The silence was the worst part, you know, not the darkness or the walls but the complete absence of sound for days at a time.

Character 2: [gently] We're going to take this very slowly, and if you need to stop at any point during the assessment, just raise your hand and we'll pause immediately.

Character 1: How long will this take?

Character 2: Usually about forty-five minutes, but we have the room booked for two hours so there's absolutely no rush—we go at whatever pace feels comfortable for you.

Character 1: [trembling] Sometimes I still can't tell if sounds are real or if my brain is just filling in what should be there, like phantom noise from all that emptiness.

Character 2: [reassuring] That's actually a documented phenomenon called auditory pareidolia, and after prolonged sensory deprivation, your brain's response is completely normal and typically improves with gradual re-exposure.

Character 1: He would play music sometimes, maybe once a month, classical mostly, and I'd press my ear against the door trying to memorize every note before it stopped again. [voice breaking]

Character 2: [measured] The fact that you could distinguish it as classical music suggests your auditory processing centers remained largely intact, which is actually quite remarkable given the circumstances.

Character 1: Is that why everything sounds too sharp now, too bright, like the whole world is screaming at me even when people whisper?

Character 2: Your auditory system has been in a hypervigilant state, essentially turned up to maximum sensitivity trying to detect any sound at all, and now it needs time to recalibrate. [pause] We can help with that.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Seven years of silence and now I can hear my own heartbeat so loud it keeps me awake, hear people breathing from across the room, hear everything except what people mean when they talk.

Character 2: The emotional context of speech, the subtle tones that convey meaning beyond words—those require different processing than pure sound detection, but they can be relearned with targeted therapy.

Character 1: [softer] Will I ever be normal?

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Normal is a moving target, but I've seen patients with similar trauma histories develop not just functional hearing but actually enhanced auditory awareness that becomes almost a superpower once properly managed.

Character 1: My mother's voice—I've forgotten what it sounds like, completely forgotten, and she calls every day now but it's just a stranger's voice coming through the phone. [choking up]

Character 2: Memory for specific voices can fade without reinforcement, but here's something interesting: we can use audio recordings from before, home videos perhaps, to help rebuild those neural pathways connecting sound to emotional memory.

Character 1: [desperately] You really think the recordings could help me remember her, actually remember her and not just know intellectually that she's my mother?

Character 2: [warmly] I do, yes.

Character 1: The first bird I heard after getting out—I thought I was hallucinating because I'd imagined bird songs so many times in that room, created whole symphonies in my head.

Character 2: [with quiet admiration] The fact that you held onto the memory of bird songs, that you could imagine them so vividly even in isolation, shows an incredible resilience in your auditory imagination that we can absolutely build upon.
