Scenario: A transfer student discovers their new dorm roommate sitting alone on the rooftop at 3 AM, staring at old photographs and questioning whether they should drop out.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [startled] Oh, I didn't expect anyone else to be up here at, um, three in the morning. Are you... are you okay? You've been sitting there for a while, I think.

Character 2: Depends on your definition of okay.

Character 1: [hesitantly] I mean, I get it. New place, everything feels off. I've been transferring schools since I was twelve, so, uh, the whole disconnected feeling is pretty much my default state at this point.

Character 1: [softer] Those look old, the photos you're holding. Family or, um, friends from before?

Character 2: Before what?

Character 1: [carefully] Before whatever brought you up to this roof at three AM with a box of memories and that look on your face. The one that says you're, I don't know, trying to figure out if you still belong anywhere.

Character 2: Hmm. Pretty perceptive.

Character 1: Look, I know we just met, well, technically we haven't even met yet, but, um, I recognize that particular brand of lost. [sighs] Been there more times than I can count.

Character 2: These are from my first year here, back when I thought I knew exactly who I was gonna be, you know? Pre-med, straight A's, the whole ambitious package. [bitter laugh]

Character 1: [gently] And now you're what, junior year? Senior? Something must've changed pretty dramatically to have you up here contemplating, er, whatever you're contemplating.

Character 2: Failed organic chemistry twice. My advisor basically told me to find a new dream because this one's dead. Three years of my life just... gone.

Character 1: Ouch. That's, um, that's rough. Though, I mean, three years isn't gone exactly, it's just... redirected maybe? Like, you still learned things, met people, grew as a person or whatever.

Character 2: [wistfully] You sound like my therapist, except she charges two hundred an hour to say that. These photos though, they're from when everything made sense, when I actually believed I was meant for something specific.

Character 1: Who says you aren't?

Character 2: Reality. [exhales]

Character 1: [thoughtfully] You know what? Every school I've transferred to, I've had to completely reinvent myself. Not because I wanted to, but because, well, I had no choice. And honestly, it's terrifying every single time.

Character 2: [quietly curious] How many schools total? And, um, why do you keep having to move? Military family or something?

Character 1: Six schools in ten years. My mom's job, she's a corporate restructuring specialist, which basically means she goes wherever companies are falling apart. [rueful chuckle] Ironic, right? She fixes broken things for a living but never stays long enough to see if they actually heal.

Character 2: [softer] That's actually kind of beautiful in a really messed up way. Maybe that's what we all are, just... temporarily fixed, waiting for the next thing to break us open again. [long pause]

Character 1: [warmly] I'm Jordan, by the way. And for what it's worth, I think being lost means you're still looking for something, which is, um, better than giving up entirely, right?
