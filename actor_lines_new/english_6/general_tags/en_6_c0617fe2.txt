Scenario: A librarian finds a regular patron who's been sleeping in the library every day for weeks, finally staying past closing time on the anniversary of a personal tragedy.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [gently] The library's been closed for forty-five minutes now, but I noticed you're still here in the poetry section, same corner you've been sitting in every day for the past three weeks.

Character 2: Does it matter? Tomorrow I'll just be back in the same spot, reading the same books, pretending there's some point to any of this. [hollow laugh]

Character 1: You've been reading Neruda's Twenty Love Poems over and over, specifically that one about forgotten September, and I can't help but notice today's date.

Character 2: [bitterly] September fourteenth. Two years since she decided my love poems weren't worth staying for, weren't worth anything really.

Character 1: I've watched a lot of people grieve in these stacks over the years, and there's something about the way you hold that book, like it's both keeping you afloat and pulling you under.

Character 2: [quieter] It doesn't keep me afloat. Nothing does. I come here because it's the only place that expects nothing from me except silence.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] That's not entirely true though—you always reshelve the books perfectly, you help that elderly gentleman reach the high shelves every Tuesday, and last week you fixed our broken cart without anyone asking.

Character 2: Small meaningless gestures in a meaningless world. [sighs] The cart will break again, the old man will eventually stop coming, and someone else will mess up the shelves.

Character 1: Maybe, but right now the cart works, Mr. Chen can reach his mysteries, and section 811.54 is immaculate because of you.

Character 2: [wryly] You're really reaching if you think organizing poetry books gives life meaning—they're just words from dead people about feelings that didn't last.

Character 1: [softly] And yet you're here.

Character 2: Because I have nowhere else to go, no one waiting, nothing but an empty apartment and the sound of the couple upstairs living the life I'll never have.

Character 1: There's a night shift position opening up here, basically just security and reshelving returns, and I think someone who already knows every book's proper place might find it, [pause], less empty than that apartment.

Character 2: [stunned] You're offering me a job? Based on what, my excellent skill at being pathetically heartbroken in your poetry section?

Character 1: Based on three weeks of watching you treat these books with more care than most people treat anything, even when you believe nothing matters.

Character 2: It won't fix anything. [exhales heavily]

Character 1: [warmly] No, but it might give you a reason to be somewhere other than that corner, and sometimes that's enough to start with—just being somewhere with a purpose, even a small one.

Character 2: You know I'll just end up being the bitter night librarian who ruins everyone's late-night study sessions with my pessimistic existence.

Character 1: Maybe, or maybe you'll be the one who understands why someone needs to sit alone with Neruda at two in the morning, and that understanding might matter more than you think.

Character 2: [quietly resigned] When would I start?
