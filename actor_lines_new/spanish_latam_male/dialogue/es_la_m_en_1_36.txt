Character 1 [en]: So I heard you're helping with visas for the film festival this year? How many applications are we talking?

Character 2 [en]: Oh yeah, it's actually, um, pretty wild this year—we've got 247 international filmmakers needing various types of visas, which is, hmm, about 40% more than last year. The thing is, each one needs like individualized documentation, so we're basically drowning in paperwork right now.

Character 1 [en]: 247? That seems like a lot for our festival.

Character 2 [en]: Well, I mean, it sounds huge but honestly it's becoming pretty standard for mid-tier festivals. We've got filmmakers from, let's see... 47 different countries this year, and each country has its own, uh, quirks with documentation requirements.

Character 1 [en]: Which countries are the most complicated?

Character 2 [en]: Oof, definitely the ones you'd expect—China requires about 15 different forms, and Brazil's been, err, particularly tricky since they changed their cultural exchange requirements. But here's what kills me: France, supposedly easy, has been rejecting our standard invitation letters for some reason.

Character 1 [en]: Wait, France is being difficult? They send the most filmmakers usually, right?

Character 2 [en]: [anxious] Exactly, we've got 31 French filmmakers and, um, honestly I'm kind of panicking because their consulate wants this new certification that literally didn't exist two months ago. It's like they're trying to make this harder on purpose or something.

Character 1 [en]: Can we push back the festival dates if we need to?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, not really feasible at this point. See, we've already locked in venues for March 15th through 22nd, and changing those dates would cost us, ugh, probably around $75,000 in cancellation fees alone, not to mention losing our promotional momentum.

Character 1 [en]: Seventy-five thousand? Jesus. How much is the whole visa process costing us?

Character 2 [en]: [over confidently] Oh, that's easy—my team's got this down to a science now, we're looking at roughly $112 per filmmaker for the basic visa support, which comes out to about $27,000 total. That's actually, hmm, way better than most festivals our size, frankly.

Character 1 [en]: Still seems expensive for paperwork.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] Yeah, I mean... between you and me, about 30% of that is just covering potential emergency situations. Last year we had to literally fly someone to DC to hand-deliver documents when the online system crashed, so now we just, uh, build that cushion in.

Character 1 [en]: Have we had any rejections yet this year?

Character 2 [en]: So far we've had 6 initial rejections, but here's the thing—all of them were fixable with additional documentation. The success rate after appeals is actually really good, like 94%, which sounds great until you realize that means, err, roughly 15 filmmakers might still not make it.

Character 1 [en]: Fifteen people missing would be noticeable. What's our backup plan?

Character 2 [en]: Right, so we're actually being pretty proactive about this—we've pre-recorded, um, acceptance speeches from everyone just in case, and we're setting up satellite screening rooms in 8 cities. That way if someone can't make it physically, they can still, you know, participate virtually in real-time Q&As.

Character 1 [en]: [empathetically] This sounds incredibly stressful. How are you managing all of this?

Character 2 [en]: [groan] Honestly? Coffee, spreadsheets, and a truly unhealthy number of color-coded folders. But hey, when you see these filmmakers finally arrive and, um, share their work after all this bureaucratic nightmare, it's actually kind of worth the madness, you know?
