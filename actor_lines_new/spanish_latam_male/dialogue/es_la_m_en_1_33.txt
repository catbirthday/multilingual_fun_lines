Character 1 [en]: So um, have you thought any more about joining the rec league with me? The volleyball one?

Character 2 [en]: [crying while speaking] I— I really want to, okay? But the last time I played competitively was with Sarah and it's just... god, it brings back so many memories of before she got sick, you know?

Character 1 [en]: Oh jeez, I didn't— I didn't realize that's what was holding you back.

Character 2 [en]: Yeah no, it's fine, I mean, I should probably get back out there eventually. It's been what, almost two years now? She'd probably kick my ass for sitting on the sidelines this long, honestly.

Character 1 [en]: [very sincerely] You were incredible together. Best duo the league had seen in years.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, we had our moments for sure. That championship match where we came back from being down fourteen points? I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Her spike was just... unstoppable when she was really in the zone.

Character 1 [en]: Would it help if we, uh, played a different position maybe? Mix things up?

Character 2 [en]: Actually that's— yeah, that might work. I've been kind of curious about trying setter anyway, and it'd be different enough that maybe it wouldn't feel so much like I'm trying to replace what we had, you know?

Character 1 [en]: [flirtatious] Plus you'd get to see me in those little shorts every Thursday night.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] Oh come on, that's not— we're talking about something serious here and you're making jokes about athletic wear? Though I mean, I guess if it gets me back on the court, whatever motivation works, right?

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] That's the spirit! Registration closes tomorrow actually.

Character 2 [en]: [very quickly] Wait tomorrow? You didn't mention that before! Okay okay, um, what do I need— is there paperwork or fees or do I need equipment because my knee pads are probably completely shot by now and I don't even know if my shoes still fit properly.

Character 1 [en]: Woah, slow down. It's just, like, a quick online form and sixty bucks.

Character 2 [en]: Right, yeah, of course. Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself here. It's weird how muscle memory kicks in, like suddenly I'm thinking about warm-up routines and remembering which brand of athletic tape worked best for my wrists.

Character 1 [en]: [slurring] You know what? After my third beer at Katie's party last week, I signed us both up already.

Character 2 [en]: [extremely happy] You did WHAT? Oh my god, you absolute lunatic! I can't believe you— wait, so we're actually doing this? Like, for real we're playing again? This is, wow, this is actually happening!

Character 1 [en]: Yep. First game's next Thursday at seven. I um, I hope you don't hate me.

Character 2 [en]: Hate you? Are you kidding? I've been stuck in this weird paralysis about it for months, going back and forth, and you just... you cut right through it. Though I'm definitely making you buy the first round of post-game drinks.

Character 1 [en]: [cheerful] Deal! Oh and I put us on the same team as Marcus and his girlfriend.

Character 2 [en]: Marcus from your work? The one who played in college? Oh man, we might actually have a shot at not completely embarrassing ourselves out there. This is— yeah, this feels right. Thank you for, er, forcing my hand I guess.
