Character 1 [en]: Do you think social media has made us worse at real friendships?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, that's... erhm, I've been wrestling with this myself actually. Like, I have hundreds of "friends" online but sometimes I'm sitting there scrolling and feeling lonelier than ever, which is just, you know, deeply ironic when you think about it.

Character 1 [en]: I barely talk to my actual friends anymore.

Character 2 [en]: Right? And it's so weird because we're technically more connected than ever, but the connections feel so... hollow, I suppose? Like we're all performing friendship rather than actually, um, experiencing it—everyone's curating their best moments while real life just kind of passes by.

Character 1 [en]: When did it get this bad?

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, I think it was gradual, you know? First it was just sharing photos, then suddenly we're measuring our worth in likes and comments, and before you realize it, well, you're having entire relationships through emoji reactions instead of actual conversations.

Character 1 [en]: My sister only texts in memes now.

Character 2 [en]: [pause] Yeah, that's... wow, that's actually hitting something for me. We've basically replaced emotional vocabulary with, like, pre-packaged jokes and references, haven't we? It's easier to send a funny video than to say "I miss you" or "I'm struggling."

Character 1 [en]: Is it easier though?

Character 2 [en]: Ooh, okay, you're right—maybe "easier" isn't the right word. It's more like... safer? Less vulnerable? Because if someone doesn't respond to your meme, whatever, but if they ignore your actual feelings, that's, erhm, that's devastating.

Character 1 [en]: What about the comparison thing?

Character 2 [en]: [furious] God, don't even get me started on that toxic nightmare! Everyone's posting their highlight reels while you're sitting there in your pajamas at 2pm feeling like a complete failure—it's literally designed to make us feel inadequate so we keep scrolling for validation!

Character 1 [en]: I deleted Instagram last month.

Character 2 [en]: How's that going? Because I keep thinking about doing the same thing but then I panic about, like, missing out or losing touch with people, even though—hang on, this is ridiculous—most of those people I haven't actually talked to in years anyway.

Character 1 [en]: It's weird but also freeing.

Character 2 [en]: The thing that really gets me is how we've normalized this constant surveillance of each other's lives, you know? Like, I know what my high school acquaintances had for breakfast but I haven't called my best friend in, gosh, probably three months.

Character 1 [en]: Have you noticed how awkward real conversations are now?

Character 2 [en]: Yes! Everyone's forgotten how to just... exist together without documenting it. Last week I was at dinner and literally everyone was photographing their food—meanwhile the actual conversation was basically non-existent, just people waiting for their turn to share their own thing.

Character 1 [en]: Think we can ever go back?

Character 2 [en]: [bitter] Honestly? I doubt it—we've basically rewired our brains for these little dopamine hits, and the companies know exactly what they're doing. Maybe the best we can do is just... try to carve out real moments despite all the noise, but man, it shouldn't be this hard to just be human with each other.
