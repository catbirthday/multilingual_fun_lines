Character 1 [en]: So you got the actual numbers? The real ones?

Character 2 [en]: I did, yeah. Um, my source at the comptroller's office finally came through after, like, three months of asking. The deficit for the current fiscal year is... let me pull this up... $847 million, which is actually worse than what they've been saying publicly.

Character 1 [en]: Eight hundred and forty-seven million? That's insane.

Character 2 [en]: [stern] It gets worse. The unfunded pension liability jumped from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion in just eighteen months. That's, uh, that's not sustainable by any metric, and they've been basically hiding it by reclassifying the debt obligations.

Character 1 [en]: How do they even hide something that big?

Character 2 [en]: Oh man, it's actually pretty clever if you're, you know, into financial manipulation. They moved about $400 million into something called "deferred maintenance obligations" which doesn't technically count against the operating budget, so on paper things look, um, manageable.

Character 1 [en]: Wait wait wait, I need to write this down. Four hundred million in what?

Character 2 [en]: [sad] Deferred maintenance. Look, here's the really heartbreaking part though... the school district's share of all this? They're looking at a 12% budget cut next year. That's, uh, that's roughly 1,200 teachers and support staff who won't have jobs come September.

Character 1 [en]: Twelve hundred people?

Character 2 [en]: [quickly] Yeah yeah, and that's conservative. If the state doesn't approve the emergency funding request, which let's be honest they probably won't, we're looking at closer to 1,500 positions eliminated plus they'll have to shut down at least eight schools.

Character 1 [en]: [over confidently] I mean, they have to approve it. There's no way they let it get that bad.

Character 2 [en]: Mmm, I wish I had your optimism but the numbers don't lie. Property tax revenue is down 18% from projections, sales tax is off by another 11%, and the rainy day fund? It's sitting at $23 million, which sounds like a lot but that's basically, like, two weeks of operating expenses.

Character 1 [en]: [gasp softly] Twenty-three million is only two weeks?

Character 2 [en]: I know, right? The city burns through about $11.5 million a week just keeping the lights on and, uh, paying salaries. Oh, and here's another fun one—overtime costs alone hit $67 million last year, which was, um, forty percent over budget.

Character 1 [en]: Jesus. Do you have all this documented?

Character 2 [en]: Every single number, yeah. I've got copies of the internal memos, the audit reports, even some emails between the mayor's office and the budget director where they're basically admitting they can't, uh, they can't make the math work without massive cuts somewhere.

Character 1 [en]: When are you running this story?

Character 2 [en]: Tomorrow morning, assuming legal clears it. The editor wants to give the mayor's office until 5 PM today to comment, but honestly I don't think they will—they've been dodging my calls for, like, three days now and I think they know what's coming.

Character 1 [en]: [shy] Can I... would it be okay if I got an advance copy? For research?

Character 2 [en]: Ahh, normally I'd say yes but with something this sensitive... look, I'll text you the headline numbers after it goes live, how's that? The full dataset will be online anyway—all 186 pages of spreadsheets if you're, um, if you're really into that kind of thing.
