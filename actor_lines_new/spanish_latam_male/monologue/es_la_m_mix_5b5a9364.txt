=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [relieved] God, that kid was so close to signing their life away. O sea, cuando entró a mi oficina con ese contrato, todo emocionado y... Jesús. [short pause] The look on their face when I started going through the clauses. ¿Sabes qué fue lo que más me molestó? Habían escondido las peores partes en, este, en la subsección 12 de los derechos de merchandising. Básicamente le daban—la disquera se hubiera quedado con todo. ¿Cada canción por cuánto, 15 años? [angry] And the recoupment terms were just... [sigh]

I kept thinking about my nephew, you know? Misma edad, mismos sueños. Este chamaco tenía, eh, ¿tal vez 19? ¿20? Ahí sentado confiando en esta gente que básicamente estaba tratando de... de robarle su futuro. [warm] But we got them out. Me tomó 3 semanas de negociaciones pero le conseguimos un contrato de verdad. [chuckle]

Actually saw them on TV last night. [smiling speaking] Recibiendo un Grammy. Y yo ahí sentado pensando, hermano, ¿qué hubiera pasado si hubiera firmado ese primer contrato? Todavía le estaría debiendo plata a la disquera ahorita, probablemente trabajando en cualquier cosa, todo ese talento así... desperdiciado. [very sincerely] Sometimes this job feels worth it, you know?


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [relieved] God, that kid was so close to signing their life away. I mean, when they walked into my office with that contract, all excited and... Jesus. [short pause] The look on their face when I started going through the clauses. You know what really got me? They'd hidden the worst parts in, um, in subsection twelve of the merchandising rights. Basically gave them—the label would've owned everything. Every song for, what, fifteen years? [angry] And the recoupment terms were just... [sigh] 

I kept thinking about my nephew, you know? Same age, same dreams. This kid was, er, maybe nineteen? Twenty? Just sitting there trusting these people who were essentially trying to... to steal their future. [warm] But we got them out. Took me three weeks of negotiations but we got them a real deal. [chuckle] 

Actually saw them on TV last night. [smiling speaking] Accepting a Grammy. And I just sat there thinking, man, what if they'd signed that first contract? They'd still be owing the label money right now, probably working some day job, all that talent just... gone. [very sincerely] Sometimes this job feels worth it, you know?
