Subject: Your peasant family's land is being bought by developers for enough money to change your life, but it's been home for generations

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: Three million. [pause] They said three million for our fields. [confused] I keep saying it out loud because it doesn't—it doesn't feel real, you know? [nervous] My grandfather's grandfather cleared this land with his bare hands. [slowly] Four generations of us, working these same fields, and now some company wants to put up... what, apartments? [bitter] Shopping centers? [sigh] 

The thing is, um, with that money we could actually—[hesitantly] we could send Maria to university. [warming] Get Papa the surgery he needs. [quickly] Move somewhere with running water, electricity that actually works. [pause] But then I walk outside and I see, erm... I see the olive tree where Mama taught me to climb. [very sad] The stone wall my brothers and I built that summer when—[trailing off] 

[shaky voice] How do you put a price on that? [long pause] Everyone says we're stupid if we don't take it. [frustrated] "It's just dirt," they say. [angry] But it's not just dirt! [cry] It's where we buried our ancestors, where I... where I learned what it means to belong somewhere. [sniffle]

[exhausted] Maybe I'm being foolish. [quietly] Maybe keeping my children here, struggling like we've always struggled, that's the real betrayal. [sigh] I honestly don't know anymore.
