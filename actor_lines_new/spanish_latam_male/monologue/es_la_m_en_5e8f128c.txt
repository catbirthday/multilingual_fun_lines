=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: I still can't believe it started with just one family. [warm] This woman came in, and she was holding all these medical bills, just shaking. [very quietly] She whispered that she couldn't afford her son's treatments. [pause] And I'm sitting there in my little cubicle thinking, there has to be a better way than just... telling people no. [empathetically] So I started sketching out this idea on a napkin during lunch. [laugh] A napkin! [excited] What if we could break everything down into, like, actually manageable chunks? [speeding up] Not just arbitrary numbers but amounts based on what families could realistically handle each month. [passionate] My supervisor thought I was crazy at first. [chuckle] But then we tried it with five families as a test. [very sincerely] Every single one of them cried. [emotional pause] Happy tears though. [smiling speaking] Now it's— it's in the whole system. [extremely happy] Hundreds of families are using it! [voice breaking] Last week a dad sent me a picture of his daughter at her graduation. [sniffle] She got through her cancer treatments without them losing their house. [shaky voice] Because of something I drew on a napkin. [very quietly] Sometimes I walk through the billing department and hear other reps explaining the payment plans. [warm] My payment plans. [laugh softly] I mean, they're the company's now, but... [trailing off] I don't know, it's, um... it's pretty incredible.
