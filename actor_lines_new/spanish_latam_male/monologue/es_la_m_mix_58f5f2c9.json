[crying while speaking] Perdón, es que—no puedo creer que sea real. [sniffle]\n\nCuando empecé en 2001, había, ¿qué, unos 400 nomás? [very quietly] Pensé que los íbamos a perder. [pause] Todos decían que era demasiado tarde, ¿sabes? La destrucción del hábitat, el calentamiento de las aguas, todo el... [trailing off]\n\n[laugh] ¡Pero seguimos adelante! Los programas de reproducción, las zonas protegidas—Dios, ¿te acuerdas cuando tuvimos que pelear por cada maldito kilómetro cuadrado de santuario? [passionately] ¡Y ahora hay más de 8000 allá afuera! [gasp loudly] ¡Ocho mil!\n\n[warm] Mi hija ni siquiera se acuerda de cuando estaban en peligro crítico. [chuckle] She just thinks they've always been there, swimming around like—como si fuera lo más normal del mundo. [very sincerely] Y así debe ser, ¿no? That's the whole point.\n\n[sigh] No dejo de pensar en la Dra. Martínez. [sad] No llegó a ver esto. She worked forty years on this species and... [pause]\n\n[relieved] Pero lo logramos.
