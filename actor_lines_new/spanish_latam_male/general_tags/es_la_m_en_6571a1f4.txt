=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shakily] So I need to tell you something before you see the credit card statements that came in today, and I know you're going to be upset but please just let me explain everything first.

Character 2 [en]: The statements? I handle all our finances digitally now, remember? What statements came in— [pause] wait, which credit cards are you talking about exactly?

Character 1 [en]: [voice dropping] The ones I opened last year when my mom got sick, and then the other two after that when the first one maxed out and I was trying to juggle the payments.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly stunned] Four credit cards? You opened four credit cards without telling me while I've been meticulously planning our retirement fund and telling clients about financial transparency in relationships?

Character 1 [en]: I kept thinking I could fix it before you found out, that I'd get that promotion or pick up extra freelance work and just pay them down quietly. [exhales] But the interest keeps compounding faster than I can catch up.

Character 2 [en]: How much are we talking about here? And please don't minimize it or round down—I need the actual number if we're going to figure this out together.

Character 1 [en]: Forty-seven thousand dollars across all four cards, with interest rates between nineteen and twenty-four percent because my credit score tanked after I missed those payments in September.

Character 2 [en]: [controlled breathing] Forty-seven thousand. That's more than half our emergency fund, more than what we saved for the house down payment, more than—God, how did it get this bad?

Character 1 [en]: [tearfully] Every month I'd swear I wouldn't use them again, but then something would happen—the car would break down or I'd see you planning our vacation and know I couldn't afford my half without the cards.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] Stop. Just stop.

Character 1 [en]: I know you must hate me right now, and I understand if you want to leave because I've basically destroyed everything you've worked so hard to build for us.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] I don't hate you, but I'm trying to process how my own partner felt they couldn't come to me—someone who literally counsels people through debt crisis for a living. [pause] What made you think hiding this was better than asking for help?

Character 1 [en]: [defensive] Because you're always so perfect with money, calculating everything down to the penny, and I didn't want you to see me as another one of your disaster clients who can't manage basic finances.

Character 2 [en]: You're not a client, you're the person I chose to build a life with, which means we face financial problems together, not in secret. [sighs] We need to consolidate these immediately before the interest destroys us completely.

Character 1 [en]: [hopefully] So you're not leaving? Even after I lied for over a year and put us in this massive hole that might take years to climb out of?

Character 2 [en]: I'm angry, definitely. And hurt.

Character 1 [en]: I'll do whatever it takes—second job, selling my car, therapy to figure out why I handle stress by secretly spending money we don't have. [voice cracking] I just need you to believe I can fix this.

Character 2 [en]: [determined] We'll fix this, together, but it means complete financial transparency from now on—every receipt, every transaction, every temptation to spend gets discussed. Can you commit to that level of openness?

Character 1 [en]: [exhales deeply] Yes, absolutely yes, and I know it'll be hard to rebuild your trust but I want our future more than I want to hide from my shame about money.

Character 2 [en]: [gently firm] Good, because tomorrow morning we're calling each creditor, setting up payment plans, and you're cutting up every one of those cards while I watch—this ends now, completely and permanently.
