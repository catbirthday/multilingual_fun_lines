=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: The interpreter said you specifically requested me for this deposition, but they didn't mention your name or why I was chosen from all the witnesses. [pause]

Character 2 [en]: [measured] Your testimony is crucial because you were the only one who saw the shooter's face clearly that night in the marketplace. We need every detail you can remember.

Character 1 [en]: [stunned] Elena?

Character 2 [en]: [steadying voice] Yes, it's me. But right now I need you to focus on what happened on March fifteenth, not on... us.

Character 1 [en]: How?

Character 2 [en]: [clinical] I work for the International Criminal Court now, prosecuting war crimes in our region. This case landed on my desk three weeks ago. [clears throat]

Character 1 [en]: You swore you'd never work for any government after what they did to Papa, and here you are wearing their badge and speaking their language.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] I'm trying to get justice for the thirty-seven people who died that night, including the Ramirez family's youngest daughter who you held while she bled out.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] Don't.

Character 2 [en]: [softer] I read your initial statement to the embassy. You said the shooter had a scar across his left eyebrow, military boots, and spoke with a northern accent.

Character 1 [en]: Seven years, Elena. Seven years of not knowing if you were alive or dead after I crossed that border, and now you're here asking me to relive the worst night of my life.

Character 2 [en]: [quietly intense] I know exactly which night you crossed because I was the one who created the distraction at the checkpoint. Did you really think those guards just happened to abandon their post?

Character 1 [en]: [voice breaking] You helped me escape? But your letters, they stopped coming, and Mama said you'd denounced me as a traitor to anyone who would listen.

Character 2 [en]: [bitter laugh] Of course she did. It was the only way to protect you from retaliation. Every letter I sent would have been traced back to you.

Character 1 [en]: The shooter, [exhales], he wasn't just some soldier. He was Colonel Medina's son, the one who runs the eastern district now.

Character 2 [en]: [leaning forward] That's not in any of your statements. Are you absolutely certain it was him?

Character 1 [en]: [resolved] He looked me right in the eyes before he opened fire on the crowd. Said one word: 'Remember.' Same thing he said when they took Papa.

Character 2 [en]: This changes everything about the case. [pause] We're going to need you in protective custody immediately.

Character 1 [en]: No. I'm done running from these ghosts. If testifying means something now, if it means you and I can finally stop pretending we're strangers, then I'll do it.

Character 2 [en]: [almost whispered] After this is over, after the trial, maybe we can try to be siblings again instead of just two people on opposite sides of a border.
