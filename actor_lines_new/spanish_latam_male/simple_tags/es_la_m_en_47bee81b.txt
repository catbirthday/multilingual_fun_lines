Scenario: A human trafficking survivor meets with a grant writer who needs their personal testimony for a funding application that could help other survivors.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] So, um, I know we talked about this on the phone, but I'm still not entirely sure how much detail you actually need from me. [pause] Like, are we talking dates and places, or do you need the, uh, the harder stuff too?

Character 2 [en]: [gently] I understand this is incredibly difficult, and I want you to know that we can take breaks whenever you need them. [sighs] Unfortunately, the foundation requires what they call 'compelling personal narratives' to justify the funding—it's, well, it's how they measure impact.

Character 1 [en]: [frustrated] Compelling. [bitter laugh] That's what they want to call it? My worst nightmare packaged up nice and neat for some board members to read over coffee?

Character 2 [en]: [apologetic] I know how that sounds, I really do. [quietly] But this grant could fund counseling services for fifty other survivors this year. [pause] Your story, as painful as it is, could literally save lives.

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] You know what they did to us in those containers, right? [very quietly] Forty-three days without seeing sunlight, people dying around me, and you're asking me to write it down like it's some kind of, I don't know, like a college essay or something.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] No, no, that's not what I'm asking at all. [firmly] We can work together on this—you talk, I'll write, and you have complete control over every single word that goes on that page. Nothing gets submitted without your explicit approval.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] But once it's out there, once it's in their system, it's not mine anymore, is it? [sighs heavily] Some program officer in DC is gonna read about the worst thing that ever happened to me while they're eating their lunch.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Actually, we can redact identifying details and use pseudonyms—the foundation allows that for safety reasons. [reassuringly] Your real name doesn't have to appear anywhere if you don't want it to.

Character 1 [en]: [surprised] Oh. [pause] Sarah didn't mention that was an option. [hopefully] So I could tell the story without it being, you know, specifically traceable back to me?

Character 2 [en]: [confidently] Absolutely, and honestly, that's what I'd recommend anyway for your safety and privacy. [clears throat] What matters to them is the journey—how you survived, how the organization helped you, and why others deserve that same chance.

Character 1 [en]: [slowly] The thing is, um, I barely remember some parts—trauma does that, you know? [nervously] But other moments are so vivid I can still smell the diesel fumes from the trucks. Will they think I'm lying if there are gaps?

Character 2 [en]: [very sincerely] Gaps in trauma memories are completely normal and actually make testimonies more authentic, not less. [gently] The reviewers, believe it or not, they're trained to understand trauma responses—this isn't their first time reading survivor accounts.

Character 1 [en]: [relieved] Okay, that's, uh, that's actually really good to know. [sighs] I guess I've been carrying around this fear that people won't believe me because I can't remember what happened on specific dates or whatever.

Character 2 [en]: [encouragingly] Your truth doesn't need timestamps to be valid. [warmly] Look, why don't we start with just the parts you're comfortable sharing today? We have three weeks before the deadline, so there's no rush.

Character 1 [en]: [hesitantly] Three weeks. [exhales] Alright, yeah, I can do this. [more firmly] But I need to know—what happens to my story after the grant? Does it just sit in some database forever?

Character 2 [en]: [professionally] The foundation keeps applications for seven years for audit purposes, but they're bound by strict confidentiality agreements. [reassuringly] After that, we can request full deletion, and I always follow up to make sure it happens.

Character 1 [en]: [curious] You've done this before then? [quietly] Helped other survivors navigate this whole grant world? Because honestly, I feel like I'm drowning in requirements and protocols I don't understand.

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] For eight years now, yes, and every single survivor I've worked with has felt exactly the same way at first. [chuckles softly] The nonprofit world has its own language, but that's my job—to translate between your truth and their paperwork.

Character 1 [en]: [gratefully] That's, um, that's really comforting actually. [pause] Okay, let's do this. [deep breath] Where do you want me to start?

Character 2 [en]: [gently] How about we start with after—with the day you got out, the day you found freedom. [very sincerely] Sometimes working backwards helps, starting from safety and strength rather than diving straight into the darkness. Does that feel manageable?
