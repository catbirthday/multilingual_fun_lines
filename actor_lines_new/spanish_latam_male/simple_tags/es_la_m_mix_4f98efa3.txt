=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [hesitantly] So the specifications I sent over for the escape tank, necesitan ser absolutamente precisas porque un milímetro de diferencia y los seguros no van a alinear bien durante la secuencia submarina.

Character 2 [mix]: [coldly] Yeah, I read them three times already, cada medida, cada curva, cada maldito detalle de tu trampa mortal preciosa. [pause] Siempre fuiste obsesivo con la precisión, ¿verdad, papá?

Character 1 [mix]: [shocked] How did you— [clears throat] O sea, no estaba seguro si me habías reconocido después de tantos años, con el nombre artístico y todo lo que ha cambiado de quien solía ser.

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] Oh please, you think some fancy costume, ¿y llamarte 'El Gran Mysterio' en vez de Frank Morrison me iba a engañar? [laughs harshly] He estado mirando tus fotos publicitarias por semanas desde que reservaste este encargo.

Character 1 [mix]: [apologetic] Listen, I know walking out when you were twelve was unforgivable, pero me estaba ahogando en deudas de las giras de casino y tu madre, ella merecía algo mejor que un mago fracasado que ni siquiera podía conseguir fiestas de cumpleaños.

Character 2 [mix]: So you just disappeared like one of your stupid tricks? [angrily] Mamá lloró hasta dormirse por 2 años mientras yo aprendía solo a trabajar con fibra de vidrio en el taller del tío Pete para ayudar a pagar las cuentas.

Character 1 [mix]: [regretful] Every single show I perform, cada aplauso del público, pienso en cómo debería haber estado ahí enseñándote trucos de cartas en vez de aprenderlos de extraños en los cuartos traseros de Vegas.

Character 2 [mix]: [frustrated] Save the sob story for your audience. [exhales] ¿Quieres este tanque construido o no? Porque tengo otros 3 clientes esperando y honestamente, rechazar tu dinero se sentiría bastante bien ahora mismo.

Character 1 [mix]: [quickly] Please, just hear me out.

Character 2 [mix]: [impatiently] You've got thirty seconds.

Character 1 [mix]: [passionately] I came to you specifically, no solo porque eres el mejor laminador de la costa, sino porque he seguido tu trabajo por años, viéndote convertirte en todo lo que yo no pude ser—confiable, exitoso, alguien con quien la gente puede contar.

Character 2 [mix]: [sarcastically] Wow, father of the year award right there, acosándome a través de revistas del gremio. [sighs] ¿Sabes cuál fue el verdadero truco de magia? Hacerte desaparecer de cada cumpleaños, cada graduación, cada momento que importaba.

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] I sent money though.

Character 2 [mix]: [furious] Money? ¿Crees que esos sobres random sin remitente compensaban algo? [voice shaking] Mamá sabía que eran tuyos y quemó cada uno porque el orgullo era lo único que nos quedaba.

Character 1 [mix]: [desperately] This tank, this whole act, es mi última presentación para siempre.

Character 2 [mix]: [confused] What are you talking about? [suspiciously] El contrato dice que vas de gira hasta la próxima primavera con esta rutina de escape, por eso necesitas las modificaciones especializadas para múltiples lugares.

Character 1 [mix]: [coughs] Terminal diagnosis.

Character 2 [mix]: [shaky voice] No, no you don't get to do this, no puedes aparecer después de 15 años y soltarme eso como si fuera a arreglar todo. [louder] ¡Eso es manipulación emocional, no magia!

Character 1 [mix]: [very sincerely] The tank needs to be perfect because I want to leave something behind, algo que pruebe que pude crear algo duradero, algo que no desapareciera, algo que mi hijo construyó con sus propias manos que nos va a sobrevivir a los dos.

Character 2 [mix]: [crying while speaking] I'll build your damn tank. [pause] Pero cuando estés adentro haciendo tu estúpido acto de escape, recuerda que yo también aprendí a aguantar la respiración bajo el agua, esperando que regresaras. [very quietly] 3 minutos y 47 segundos, ese es mi récord.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] So the specifications I sent over for the escape tank, they need to be absolutely precise because one millimeter off and the locks won't align properly during the underwater sequence.

Character 2: [coldly] Yeah, I read them three times already, every measurement, every curve, every single detail about your precious death trap. [pause] You always were obsessed with precision, weren't you, Dad?

Character 1: [shocked] How did you— [clears throat] I mean, I wasn't sure if you'd recognized me after all these years, with the stage name and everything changing so much about who I used to be.

Character 2: [bitter] Oh please, you think some fancy costume and calling yourself 'The Great Mysterio' instead of Frank Morrison would fool me? [laughs harshly] I've been staring at your publicity photos for weeks since you booked this commission.

Character 1: [apologetic] Listen, I know walking out when you were twelve was unforgivable, but I was drowning in debt from the casino tours and your mother, she deserved better than a failed magician who couldn't even book birthday parties anymore.

Character 2: So you just disappeared like one of your stupid tricks? [angrily] Mom cried herself to sleep for two years while I taught myself how to work with fiberglass in Uncle Pete's garage just to help pay the bills.

Character 1: [regretful] Every single show I perform, every audience that applauds, I think about how I should have been there teaching you card tricks instead of learning them from strangers in Vegas back rooms.

Character 2: [frustrated] Save the sob story for your audience. [exhales] You want this tank built or not? Because I've got three other clients waiting and honestly, turning down your money would feel pretty good right now.

Character 1: [quickly] Please, just hear me out.

Character 2: [impatiently] You've got thirty seconds.

Character 1: [passionately] I came to you specifically, not just because you're the best laminator on the coast, but because I've been following your work for years, watching you become everything I couldn't be—reliable, successful, someone people can count on.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Wow, father of the year award right there, stalking me through trade magazines. [sighs] You know what the real magic trick was? Making yourself vanish from every birthday, every graduation, every moment that mattered.

Character 1: [quietly] I sent money though.

Character 2: [furious] Money? You think those random envelopes with no return address made up for anything? [voice shaking] Mom knew they were from you and she burned every single one because pride was the only thing we had left.

Character 1: [desperately] This tank, this whole act, it's my last performance ever.

Character 2: [confused] What are you talking about? [suspiciously] The contract says you're touring through next spring with this escape routine, that's why you need the specialized modifications for multiple venues.

Character 1: [coughs] Terminal diagnosis.

Character 2: [shaky voice] No, no you don't get to do this, you don't get to show up after fifteen years and drop that on me like it's supposed to fix everything. [louder] That's emotional manipulation, not magic!

Character 1: [very sincerely] The tank needs to be perfect because I want to leave something behind that proves I could create something lasting, something that wouldn't disappear, something my son built with his own hands that'll outlive us both.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I'll build your damn tank. [pause] But when you're gone inside it doing your stupid escape act, remember that I learned how to hold my breath underwater too, waiting for you to come back. [very quietly] Three minutes and forty-seven seconds, that's my record.
