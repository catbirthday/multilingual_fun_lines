=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [gently] Ms. Harrison, मैं Sandra Wells हूँ, Wells & Associates Family Law से, और मुझे आपसे आपकी ex-wife Rachel के बारे में बात करनी है। [pause] आज दोपहर Northfield junction पर एक हादसा हुआ, one of the pipelines was involved.

Character 2 [mix]: [confused] Rachel? क्या मतलब है हादसा? [anxiously] मैं आज उस sector को monitor नहीं कर रही थी, Jenkins की shift थी वहाँ, I was covering the eastern grid because we're short-staffed this week.

Character 1 [mix]: [sympathetically] मुझे बहुत अफ़सोस है कि ये बताना पड़ रहा है, लेकिन Rachel explosion में नहीं बची। [quietly] Fire department ने कहा कि जब rupture हुआ तो वो गाड़ी से वहाँ से गुज़र रही थी, and her car was caught in the blast radius.

Character 2 [mix]: [shaky voice] नहीं, ये सच नहीं हो सकता, वो कभी उस रास्ते से नहीं जाती। [frantically] वो हमेशा industrial corridor से बचती थी, कहती थी कि उससे मेरे काम की याद आती है, उन सभी रातों की जब मैंने इस control room को चुना, instead of being home with her and Emma.

Character 1 [mix]: Emma सुरक्षित है, जब ये हुआ तो वो school में थी, and she's currently with Rachel's mother. लेकिन custody के कुछ मामले हैं जिन पर बात करनी होगी, since you're listed as the surviving parent in the divorce decree.

Character 2 [mix]: हे भगवान, Emma. [voice breaking] मैं उसे कैसे बताऊंगी कि उसकी माँ चली गई, something I should have prevented? मैं इस district की हर pipeline review करती हूँ, every pressure reading, every maintenance report.

Character 1 [mix]: [firmly] Ms. Harrison, ये आपकी गलती नहीं थी। [empathetically] Preliminary investigation से पता चल रहा है कि equipment failure था, deferred maintenance की वजह से, decisions made well above your level, और अभी आपको focus करना चाहिए कि Emma को क्या चाहिए।

Character 2 [mix]: [bitter] Deferred maintenance जिसे मैंने पिछले 6 महीनों में तीन बार flag किया था। [quietly] लेकिन मैंने ज़्यादा pressure नहीं डाला, enough noise नहीं मचाया, क्योंकि मैं हमेशा वही इंसान रही हूँ who doesn't rock the boat, जो protocol follow करती है।

Character 1 [mix]: [supportively] आपकी वो reports actually काफी crucial हो सकती हैं, investigation के लिए और किसी potential wrongful death claim के लिए। But right now, Emma को ये जानना चाहिए कि उसके पास एक parent है जो present है, ready to take care of her.

Character 2 [mix]: [self-deprecating] Present और ready? [laughs bitterly] मैं उस बच्ची के लिए 2 साल से present नहीं रही हूँ। Rachel कहती थी कि मैं तीन states दूर से pressure gauges monitor कर सकती हूँ, but couldn't see when my own daughter needed me.

Character 1 [mix]: [warmly] अभी भी देर नहीं हुई है, you can still change that.

Character 2 [mix]: [hesitantly] Rachel की माँ मुझसे नफरत करती है, आपको पता है। [sighs] उन्होंने divorce के लिए मुझे blame किया, कहा कि मैं इन pipes और gauges से ज़्यादा प्यार करती हूँ, more than my family, और honestly, अपनी अभी की life देखकर, maybe she wasn't wrong.

Character 1 [mix]: [gently] उन्होंने actually मुझे call किया था।

Character 2 [mix]: [surprised] Margaret ने आपको call किया? [confused] उन्होंने कसम खाई थी कि custody hearing के बाद मुझे Emma के पास नहीं आने देंगी, said I was just like her late husband, एक खतरनाक job से शादी की है जो eventually किसी को मार देगी।

Character 1 [mix]: उन्होंने कहा कि जब से Emma को पता चला है, she's been asking for you, बार-बार कह रही है कि उसकी dad टूटी चीज़ें ठीक करना जानती है। Margaret जानना चाहती हैं कि क्या आप ready हैं, to be the father Emma needs, सिर्फ paper पर नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [voice breaking] टूटी चीज़ें ठीक करना।

Character 1 [mix]: [supportively] Children's Services में एक grief counselor है जो sudden loss में specialize करती है, और मैं कल आप दोनों की meeting arrange कर सकती हूँ। [pause] Emma को अभी stability चाहिए, and despite everything, इसका मतलब है कि उसे अपने father की ज़रूरत है।

Character 2 [mix]: [quietly] मैं 16 साल से इन monitors को देख रही हूँ, leaks के लिए check करती हूँ, pressure drops के लिए, any sign something might go wrong. [exhales] लेकिन अपनी असली life में हर warning sign miss कर गई, until it all exploded anyway.

Character 1 [mix]: फर्क ये है कि Emma के साथ आपको rebuild करने का chance मिल रहा है, to monitor what actually matters. क्या आप मेरे साथ चलेंगी उसे मिलने?

Character 2 [mix]: [shaky voice] हाँ, बस मुझे अपनी बाकी shift के लिए replacement को call करनी होगी। [pause] ज़िंदगी में पहली बार, these pipelines can wait while I take care of my daughter.


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [gently] Mr. Harrison, I'm Sandra Wells from Wells & Associates Family Law, and I need to speak with you about your ex-wife Rachel. [pause] There was an incident at the Northfield junction this afternoon involving one of the pipelines.

Character 2: [confused] Rachel? What do you mean an incident? [anxiously] I wasn't monitoring that sector today, Jenkins had that shift, I was covering the eastern grid because we're short-staffed this week.

Character 1: [sympathetically] I'm so sorry to have to tell you this, but Rachel didn't survive the explosion. [quietly] The fire department said she was driving past when the rupture occurred, and her car was caught in the blast radius.

Character 2: [shaky voice] No, that can't be right, she never takes that route. [frantically] She always avoided the industrial corridor because she said it reminded her of my work, of all the nights I chose this control room over being home with her and Emma.

Character 1: Emma's safe, she was at school when it happened, and she's currently with Rachel's mother. But there are custody matters we need to discuss since you're listed as the surviving parent in the divorce decree.

Character 2: Oh God, Emma. [voice breaking] How do I tell her that her mother's gone because of something I should have prevented? I review every pipeline in this district, every pressure reading, every maintenance report.

Character 1: [firmly] Mr. Harrison, this wasn't your fault. [empathetically] The preliminary investigation suggests equipment failure from deferred maintenance, decisions made well above your level, and you need to focus on what Emma needs right now.

Character 2: [bitter] Deferred maintenance that I flagged three times in the last six months. [quietly] But I didn't push hard enough, didn't make enough noise, because I'm always the guy who doesn't rock the boat, who follows protocol.

Character 1: [supportively] Those reports you filed could actually be crucial for the investigation and any potential wrongful death claim. But right now, Emma needs to know she has a parent who's present and ready to take care of her.

Character 2: [self-deprecating] Present and ready? [laughs bitterly] I haven't been present for that kid in two years. Rachel used to say I could monitor pressure gauges from three states away but couldn't see when my own daughter needed me.

Character 1: [warmly] It's not too late to change that.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Rachel's mother hates me, you know. [sighs] She blamed me for the divorce, said I loved these pipes and gauges more than my family, and honestly, looking at my life now, maybe she wasn't wrong.

Character 1: [gently] She called me, actually.

Character 2: [surprised] Margaret called you? [confused] She swore she'd never let me near Emma again after the custody hearing, said I was just like her late husband, married to a dangerous job that would eventually kill someone.

Character 1: She said Emma's been asking for you since she heard, that she keeps saying her dad knows how to fix broken things. Margaret wants to know if you're ready to be the father Emma needs, not just the one on paper.

Character 2: [voice breaking] Fix broken things.

Character 1: [supportively] There's a grief counselor at Children's Services who specializes in sudden loss, and I can arrange for you both to meet with her tomorrow. [pause] Emma needs stability right now, and despite everything, that means she needs her father.

Character 2: [quietly] I've been staring at these monitors for sixteen years, watching for leaks, for pressure drops, for any sign something might go wrong. [exhales] But I missed every warning sign in my actual life until it all exploded anyway.

Character 1: The difference is you get a chance to rebuild with Emma, to monitor what actually matters. Will you come with me to see her?

Character 2: [shaky voice] Yes, I just need to call in my replacement for the rest of my shift. [pause] For once in my life, these pipelines can wait while I take care of my daughter.
