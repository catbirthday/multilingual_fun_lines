=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [shaky voice] You said on the phone that you found something underneath the paint layers of Emma's self-portrait, something she deliberately hid before she— [pause] I've been standing outside this lab for twenty minutes trying to work up the courage to come in.

Character 2 [en]: [hesitantly] The infrared spectroscopy revealed extensive underpainting, words and images she covered with thick layers of oils. [quietly] I've been doing this work for fifteen years, and I've never seen someone use a canvas like a diary the way your sister did.

Character 1 [en]: [anxious] Emma always said that painting was the only time she felt real, like her actual self could finally breathe. [sighs] We were identical twins, but I never understood what she meant until now.

Character 2 [en]: [carefully] The messages progress chronologically from the bottom layers upward, starting about six months before her death. [clearing throat] Some of them mention you specifically, things she wanted to say but couldn't.

Character 1 [en]: [crying while speaking] What kind of things? [very quietly] I keep thinking if I'd just paid more attention, if I hadn't been so wrapped up in my own life, maybe I would have seen the signs.

Character 2 [en]: She wrote 'My twin lives in daylight while I drown in paint fumes and shadows' across the entire bottom layer. [pause] There's also a sketch of two girls holding hands that she covered with black paint.

Character 1 [en]: We used to hold hands everywhere as kids, even in high school until people started making fun of us. [bitter] I was the one who pulled away first, said we needed to grow up and be individuals.

Character 2 [en]: [empathetically] The chemical analysis shows she returned to this painting repeatedly, adding layers whenever she was struggling. [softly] The final layer, applied just days before, contains a single word repeated seventeen times.

Character 1 [en]: [barely audible] What word? [shaky voice] Please, I need to know everything she couldn't tell me when she was alive, even if it destroys me.

Character 2 [en]: [very quietly] 'Sister' written over and over in cadmium red, the most expensive pigment she owned. [sighs] She mixed it with tears, we can tell from the salt crystals that formed as it dried.

Character 1 [en]: [monotone] She called me three times that last week, but I was at a conference in Seattle and kept sending her to voicemail. [laughs bitterly] I texted her that we'd catch up when I got back.

Character 2 [en]: [gently] There's more.

Character 1 [en]: [desperate] Every therapist keeps telling me survivor's guilt is normal for twins, that I couldn't have known, but they didn't see her painting becoming darker month by month. [exhales] I saw everything and did nothing.

Character 2 [en]: [pause] Should I continue?

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Yes, tell me all of it. [crying while speaking] I owe her that much at least, to witness what she needed me to see when it mattered.

Character 2 [en]: [slowly] Beneath the repeated 'sister' text, in the deepest layer we could access without damaging the canvas, she painted both your faces but gave you her eyes and herself yours. [very quietly] The inscription reads 'We were supposed to share everything, even this.'

Character 1 [en]: [gasping] Oh god, she thought about taking me with her? [shaky voice] Is that what she meant? That we should have died together?

Character 2 [en]: [carefully] I think she meant the pain, that she wanted to share the pain with you but couldn't figure out how. [sighs] The technical notes indicate she spent over a hundred hours just on those exchanged eyes.

Character 1 [en]: [whispering] Can I touch it? [louder] The painting, I mean, just once where her hands were, where she pressed her feelings into the canvas?

Character 2 [en]: [warmly] Normally I'd say absolutely not, but in this case, yes. [softly] Your sister embedded so much of herself in these layers that perhaps she'd want you to feel what she couldn't say. [pause] Here, put on these gloves first.
