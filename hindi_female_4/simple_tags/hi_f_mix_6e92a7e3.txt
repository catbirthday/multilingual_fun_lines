Scenario: A transmitter engineer discovers their father, an embosser who creates braille books, has been secretly working at the radio station at night to create tactile maps of the electromagnetic spectrum for blind engineering students.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [nervously] I, um, I know what this looks like— मैं यहाँ सुबह 3 बजे हूँ अपने सारे embossing equipment के साथ तुम्हारे transmitter room के फर्श पर फैले हुए, लेकिन मैं explain कर सकती हूँ, सच में, अगर तुम मुझे बस एक minute दो।

Character 2 [mix]: [shocked] Dad? What the hell are you doing in my station? [frustrated] तुम security से कैसे निकले, और ये copper sheets क्यों हैं हर जगह उस equipment के पास जो हमारे घर से ज्यादा महंगा है?

Character 1 [mix]: [quickly] The night guard knows me, okay? [hesitantly] मैं यहाँ आ रही हूँ, अम्म, शायद 6 महीने से, तुम्हारे transmitters से electromagnetic readings लेकर ये tactile frequency maps बना रही हूँ। [sighs]

Character 2 [mix]: [angry] Six months? [very loudly] तुम 6 महीने से federal broadcast facility में घुस रही हो और किसी ने मुझे बताना जरूरी नहीं समझा, मुझे, जो chief engineer हूँ?

Character 1 [mix]: [defensively] Look, I tried asking you properly, लेकिन तुम हमेशा कहती थी कि ये बहुत dangerous है, बहुत complicated है, कि FCC कभी civilians को equipment के पास नहीं आने देगा, तो मैंने, वैसे, दूसरा रास्ता ढूंढा।

Character 2 [mix]: [sternly] Another way? [exhales] मतलब illegally घुसना और emergency broadcast signals को potentially disturb करना जिन पर hospitals और first responders depend करते हैं?

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly] मैं careful हूँ।

Character 2 [mix]: [sarcastically] Oh great, you're careful while committing federal crimes। [bitterly] बहुत अच्छा Dad, सच में शानदार judgment किसी से जिसने मुझे imandaari के बारे में सिखाया था।

Character 1 [mix]: [passionately] You don't understand what this means to those students! [shaky voice] वो finally wave patterns को feel कर सकते हैं, actually frequencies को छू सकते हैं जो वो study कर रहे हैं—ये blind engineers के लिए revolutionary है, और मैं अकेली हूँ जो ये बना रही हूँ।

Character 2 [mix]: [firmly] I don't care how noble your intentions are, तुम मेरी job खो सकती हो मुझे, मेरी license, सब कुछ जिसके लिए मैंने 15 साल मेहनत की है। [pause] क्या ये तुम्हारे दिमाग में आया भी था?

Character 1 [mix]: [regretful] Of course it occurred to me, लेकिन वो बच्चे, वो मुझे letters लिखते हैं कि कैसे इन maps ने उनकी life change की, कैसे वो finally concepts समझ पाए जो पहले सिर्फ abstract numbers थे। [trailing off]

Character 2 [mix]: And you thought their education was worth more than my career? [coldly] मतलब यही decide किया तुमने, है ना? मुझसे पूछे बिना भी?

Character 1 [mix]: [desperately] No, I mean, I thought I could keep it separate, कि तुम्हें कभी पता नहीं चलेगा, और honestly, पहले कुछ weeks के बाद, security guard मुझे readings को बेहतर समझने में help करने लगा। [sighs]

Character 2 [mix]: [incredulous] Johnson's been helping you? [laughs bitterly] Perfect, तो अब मेरे अपने workplace में conspiracy है जिसमें मेरे अपने father और मेरी security team शामिल है।

Character 1 [mix]: [pleading] Listen, I'm almost finished with the full spectrum series, बस तीन और frequency ranges बाकी हैं और फिर मैं रुक जाऊंगी, promise, और हम pretend कर सकते हैं कि ये कभी हुआ ही नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [exhausted] Pretend this never happened? [slowly] Dad, हर जगह cameras हैं, log entries हैं, शायद dozens of safety violations जो मुझे commission को explain करने पड़ेंगे।

Character 1 [mix]: [defeated] So what happens now? [very quietly] तुम मुझे report करोगी, या हम कुछ work out कर सकते हैं जहाँ मैं project को legally somehow finish कर सकूं?

Character 2 [mix]: [conflicted] I should report this immediately, लेकिन मैं इन maps को देख रही हूँ और ये, अम्म, actually incredible हैं। [sighs] Detail ऐसी है जो मैंने कभी accessibility tools में नहीं देखी।

Character 1 [mix]: [hopefully] You could help me finish them properly, maybe? [tentatively] हम सही paperwork file कर सकते हैं, इसे official educational partnership बना सकते हैं—तुम्हारा knowledge मेरी embossing skills के साथ मिलकर engineering teaching को बदल सकता है। [pause]

Character 2 [mix]: [resigned] We're going to have to document everything retroactively, legal clearances लेनी होंगी, और शायद कुछ fines भी भरने होंगे, लेकिन हाँ, okay, जो तुमने शुरू किया है उसे finish करते हैं। [firmly] लेकिन आधी रात को और घुसना नहीं, समझी?


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [nervously] I, um, I know what this looks like—me being here at three in the morning with all my embossing equipment spread across your transmitter room floor, but I can explain, honestly, if you just give me a minute.

Character 2: [shocked] Dad? What the hell are you doing in my station? [frustrated] How did you even get past security, and why are there copper sheets everywhere near equipment that costs more than our house?

Character 1: [quickly] The night guard knows me, okay? [hesitantly] I've been coming here for, uh, maybe six months now, using the electromagnetic readings from your transmitters to create these tactile frequency maps. [sighs]

Character 2: [angry] Six months? [very loudly] You've been sneaking into a federal broadcast facility for half a year and nobody thought to mention this to me, the chief engineer?

Character 1: [defensively] Look, I tried asking you properly but you always said it was too dangerous, too complicated, that the FCC would never allow civilians near the equipment, so I, well, I found another way.

Character 2: [sternly] Another way? [exhales] You mean illegally trespassing and potentially disrupting emergency broadcast signals that hospitals and first responders depend on?

Character 1: [quietly] I'm careful.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Oh great, you're careful while committing federal crimes. [bitterly] That makes everything so much better, Dad, really stellar judgment there from someone who taught me about integrity.

Character 1: [passionately] You don't understand what this means to those students! [shaky voice] They can finally feel the wave patterns, actually touch the frequencies they're studying—it's revolutionary for blind engineers, and I'm the only one making these.

Character 2: [firmly] I don't care how noble your intentions are, you could lose me my job, my license, everything I've worked fifteen years to build. [pause] Did that even occur to you?

Character 1: [regretful] Of course it occurred to me, but those kids, they write me letters about how the maps changed their lives, how they finally understand concepts that were just abstract numbers before. [trailing off]

Character 2: And you thought their education was worth more than my career? [coldly] That's essentially what you decided, right? Without even asking me?

Character 1: [desperately] No, I mean, I thought I could keep it separate, that you'd never have to know, and honestly, after the first few weeks, the security guard started helping me understand the readings better. [sighs]

Character 2: [incredulous] Johnson's been helping you? [laughs bitterly] Perfect, so now I have a conspiracy in my own workplace involving my own father and my security team.

Character 1: [pleading] Listen, I'm almost finished with the full spectrum series, just three more frequency ranges and then I'll stop, I promise, and we can pretend this never happened.

Character 2: [exhausted] Pretend this never happened? [slowly] Dad, there are cameras everywhere, log entries, probably dozens of safety violations I'll have to explain to the commission.

Character 1: [defeated] So what happens now? [very quietly] Are you going to report me, or can we maybe work something out where I finish the project legally somehow?

Character 2: [conflicted] I should report this immediately, but I'm looking at these maps and they're, um, actually incredible. [sighs] The detail is unlike anything I've seen in accessibility tools.

Character 1: [hopefully] You could help me finish them properly, maybe? [tentatively] We could file the right paperwork, make it an official educational partnership—your knowledge with my embossing skills could change how engineering is taught. [pause]

Character 2: [resigned] We're going to have to document everything retroactively, get legal clearances, and probably pay some fines, but yeah, okay, let's finish what you started. [firmly] But no more midnight break-ins, understood?
