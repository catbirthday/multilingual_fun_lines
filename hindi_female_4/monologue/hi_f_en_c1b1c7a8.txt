Subject: The skeptical attitude that annoys everyone just saved your family from a financial scam

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [en]: [relieved] God, I can't believe how close that was. [pause] Mom's still shaking, honestly. [bitter] And you know what? Everyone always gives me grief about being "too negative" or whatever. [mocking] "Why can't you just trust people?" "You're so paranoid." [frustrated] Well guess what? [loudly] That "paranoid" attitude just saved us thirty thousand dollars! [exhale] 

[anxiously] The whole thing seemed, I don't know, too polished? Like when that guy called about Dad's supposed "investment opportunity" and I started asking all my annoying questions—you know the ones—everyone was rolling their eyes at dinner. [sarcastic] Oh there goes skeptical Sarah again, can't let anything be simple. [pause]

But something was just... off. The urgency, the, um, the way he kept deflecting when I asked for documentation. [quietly] And then when I found those reviews online... [gasp softly] Jesus. [shaky voice] Other families lost everything.

[warm] Dad actually thanked me. Can you believe that? [laugh] He said, "Your suspicious nature finally paid off, kiddo." [trailing off] I mean, I wish I didn't have to be like this all the time but... [sigh] [confidently] Sometimes being the family pessimist has its perks, I guess.
