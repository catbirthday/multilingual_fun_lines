Subject: Watching your benefits administration changes reduce claim denials by sixty percent and knowing real families stayed housed and healthy

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Speaker [mix]: [warm] Sixty percent. साठ प्रतिशत... मैं बार-बार रिपोर्ट को देखती रहती हूँ क्योंकि ये नंबर है ही इतना... claim denials में साठ प्रतिशत की कमी। [pause] We did that. हमारी छोटी सी policy nerds की टीम ने सच में ये कर दिखाया। [chuckle] God, remember when they said five percent improvement would be ambitious? याद है ना जब वो कहते थे कि पांच प्रतिशत सुधार भी बहुत बड़ी बात होगी? और अब देखो, हमारे पास साठ है। [short pause] But the thing is, अब बात नंबर की भी नहीं रही। [empathetically] I got an email yesterday from this woman in Ohio—कल मुझे Ohio की एक औरत का मेल आया—उसकी बेटी को leukemia है, और उसने कहा कि हमारे changes की वजह से उन्हें, उम्म... उन्हें अपना घर नहीं छोड़ना पड़ा। [clearing throat] That's a real kid who gets to stay in her own bed while she's fighting cancer. एक असली बच्ची जो कैंसर से लड़ते हुए अपने ही बिस्तर में सो सकती है। [very sincerely] एक असली परिवार जो अपनी गाड़ी में नहीं सो रहा। [pause] And there's thousands of them. हज़ारों परिवार हैं जिन्होंने appeals file किए जो इस बार actually approve हो गए। जिनकी दवाइयां मंज़ूर हो गईं। जो अपने doctors के पास जाते रह सके। [emotional] I spent three years fighting over comma placement in policy documents, तीन साल मैंने policy documents में comma कहाँ लगेगा इस पर लड़ाई की, और किसी तरह वो लोगों के घर बचाने में बदल गया। [sniffle] It's like—मेरा मतलब—इसे कैसे समझें? कैसे process करें ये सब? [relieved] Every boring meeting, every late night reviewing regulations... हर वो उबाऊ मीटिंग, regulations review करती हुई हर वो देर रात... सब का actually मतलब था। [very quietly] It really, really mattered. सच में बहुत ज़्यादा मायने रखता था।


=== Original (English) ===

Speaker: [warm] Sixty percent. I keep staring at the report because that number is just... sixty percent reduction in claim denials. [pause] We did that. Our little team of policy nerds actually did that. [chuckle] God, remember when they said five percent improvement would be ambitious? And here we are with sixty. [short pause] But the thing is, it's not even about the number anymore. [empathetically] I got an email yesterday from this woman in Ohio—her daughter has leukemia, and she said our changes meant they didn't have to, um... they didn't have to choose between treatment and keeping their apartment. [clearing throat] That's a real kid who gets to stay in her own bed while she's fighting cancer. [very sincerely] A real family that's not sleeping in their car. [pause] And there's thousands of them. Thousands of families who filed appeals that actually went through this time. Who got their medications approved. Who could keep seeing their doctors. [emotional] I spent three years fighting over comma placement in policy documents, and somehow that turned into people keeping their homes. [sniffle] It's like—how do you even process that? [relieved] Every boring meeting, every late night reviewing regulations... it actually mattered. [very quietly] It really, really mattered.
