[pause] I've got maybe, what, fifteen elderly folks on my route who live alone? [empathetically] And I check on them—not officially, but I do. Mrs. Chen always waves from her window, Mr. Peterson's got his TV on way too loud as usual. [chuckle] \n\n[serious] But that Tuesday with Mrs. Johnson... [hesitantly] I knocked, and she didn't answer, which was, um... unusual. She always answers. [anxious] So I went around back—her gate's never locked—and I could see her through the kitchen window. [speeding up] She was on the floor, trying to reach for something, and her face was all... [trailing off] \n\n[urgently] I called 911 immediately. [shaky voice] The paramedics said if I'd come even an hour later, she wouldn't have made it. [pause] \n\n[relieved] She's doing better now, actually sends me cookies every month. [chuckle softly] But it's like... I don't know, I feel this responsibility now? [sincerely] These people, they're not just addresses on my route anymore. [quietly] Sometimes I'm the only person they see all week. [warm] So yeah, I take my time. Check the windows, listen for the TV, make sure the mail's not piling up. [very sincerely] It's not in my job description, but... maybe it should be."
