=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: So apparently my package was delivered. Except it wasn't. How does that work exactly?

Customer Support [en]: Okay let me pull up your account here—what I need is your order number or if you don't have that handy I can look it up with your email address, and I'm seeing a bunch of orders here so just let me get to the right screen and we'll figure out exactly what's going on with this delivery.

Customer [en]: Order's RX4429B. Says delivered yesterday at 2:47. Wasn't.

Customer Support [en]: Right right RX4429B let me see... okay so yes I'm showing delivery confirmation yesterday October 23rd at 2:47 PM and it says it was left at the front door, signature not required, and the GPS coordinates match your address at 4821 Maple Street so let me check if there's a photo or anything else that might help us figure out where this package ended up.

Customer [en]: Front door. My front door. Where I was sitting. All day.

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, okay so that's... let me see here... sometimes what happens is the drivers mark things delivered before they actually deliver them to meet their quotas for the day and then circle back later but obviously that's not supposed to happen and if you were home all day then we definitely have a problem here.

Customer [en]: So basically they just lie? Mark it done when it's not?

Customer Support [en]: Got it.

Customer [en]: That's it? "Got it"? What happens now?

Customer Support [en]: Sorry sorry I'm pulling up our resolution options here and basically we have a few ways to handle this—we can file a missing package claim with reference number MPC-7739-2024 which takes 24 to 48 hours for investigation, or I can just go ahead and send a replacement right now with expedited shipping that'll arrive by Friday October 25th, no charge obviously, and we'll deal with the investigation on our end.

Customer [en]: How do I know the replacement won't also mysteriously "arrive"?

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: And then what, we do this dance again?

Customer Support [en]: No I hear you I really do and look what I'm going to do is flag this with delivery confirmation code DC-SIGNATURE-REQ which means the driver physically has to get someone to sign for it, can't just drop it and run, and I'm also adding a note in the system about today's issue so if there's any problem with the replacement we'll have the full history and can escalate immediately.

Customer [en]: Fine. Friday. But if it doesn't show...

Customer Support [en]: It will it will and actually let me just... okay so I'm sending you a confirmation email right now with tracking number TRK8829XM41 and my direct extension 4782 so you can call me directly if there's any issue at all and you won't have to explain everything again to someone new.

Customer [en]: Your direct line. Right. I'm sure that's real.

Customer Support [en]: No it actually is—I mean most of the time customers get the general queue but since we messed up your delivery I'm giving you my actual extension and I'm here Monday through Friday 9 to 5 Eastern time and honestly just ask for Marcus at extension 4782 and you'll get straight through to me.

Customer [en]: Marcus. 4782. We'll see.

Customer Support [en]: Absolutely and again the replacement ships today with overnight delivery for Friday the 25th before 3 PM and you should get that confirmation email in about two minutes with everything documented including the case number MPC-7739-2024 and my extension and I really am sorry about this whole mess—anything else I can help with while I have you?
