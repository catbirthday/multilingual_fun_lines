=== Translated Dialogue ===

Customer [en]: My points disappeared. Again. This is... what's the word... chronic at this point.

Customer Support [en]: Oh man, the points system has been, um, honestly it's been a nightmare this week. Let me pull up your account real quick—account ending in 4782, right? Yeah I see you had 12,450 points as of yesterday.

Customer [en]: Exactly. Now it shows zero. How does that even happen?

Customer Support [en]: Hmm, okay so what I'm seeing here is... oh wow, there was a system update at 3:47 AM that basically wiped a bunch of accounts. Which is, er, completely ridiculous, I know. Let me see if I can manually restore them.

Customer [en]: Wait. A system update. Deleted customer data. That's... concerning.

Customer Support [en]: Yeah no, you're absolutely right to be concerned. Between you and me, our IT department has been, uh... let's just say they've been having issues. But good news—I can see your points in the backup from server B-227, so I should be able to get them back.

Customer [en]: Should be able? Or will? Because last time took three weeks.

Customer Support [en]: No no, will. Definitely will. I'm actually doing it right now, just... hmm, gotta navigate this ancient interface. Okay so I'm crediting back your 12,450 points plus, er, honestly I'm throwing in an extra 2,000 for the hassle because this shouldn't keep happening.

Customer [en]: Oh. Okay that's... that's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Customer Support [en]: Of course! The transaction ID is TXN-9847-QM22 for your records, and, uh, pro tip? Screenshot your points balance weekly. I mean, we shouldn't have to tell customers that, but until they fix this mess...

Customer [en]: Let me see here... yep, showing 14,450 now. Screenshot taken.

Customer Support [en]: Perfect. And hey, if this happens again—which hopefully it won't but, er, being realistic here—ask for ticket reference RTK-3396. That's basically the "our system ate my points" code and any rep will know exactly what happened.

Customer [en]: RTK-3396. Got it. This is like the... hmm... insurance policy for next time.

Customer Support [en]: Right right.

Customer [en]: Can I use these points today? Or is there some waiting period?

Customer Support [en]: Nope, you're good to go immediately! They're showing active in batch 7724-A, so the system recognizes them as valid. Though, um, maybe use them sooner rather than later? Just in case our next update decides to get creative again.

Customer [en]: Wow. Honest. I actually appreciate that. Most reps just say everything's fine.

Customer Support [en]: Ah well, I've been here long enough to know that pretending everything's perfect doesn't actually help anybody. Your points are safe for now, the confirmation number is CNF-8823-LP if you need it, and, uh, seriously, that screenshot thing? Do it.

Customer [en]: Will do. Thanks for fixing this. And for being straight with me.

Customer Support [en]: Hey, that's what I'm here for. And honestly, customers like you who just want their stuff to work and don't scream at us? You make the job bearable. Your case number is 4419-XK if you need anything else, but fingers crossed you won't!
