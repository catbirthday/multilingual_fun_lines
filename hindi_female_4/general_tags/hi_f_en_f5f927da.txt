Scenario: A backup witness who refused to testify is cornered by the defendant in a courthouse stairwell during a recess, as the defendant desperately tries to convince them to take the stand.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [hushed panic] You can't be here—the bailiff said no contact between witnesses and defendants, and if they catch us talking in this stairwell, they'll throw out the whole case.

Character 2 [en]: [desperate whisper] I know what the rules say, but you're the only one who saw what really happened that night at the warehouse, and my lawyer says without you, I'm looking at fifteen to twenty years.

Character 1 [en]: I already told the prosecutor I wouldn't testify, that I didn't see anything clear enough to matter, and honestly, [exhales], getting involved in this mess could destroy everything I've built.

Character 2 [en]: Please, just listen—

Character 1 [en]: [voice breaking] My kids, my job at the hospital, everything depends on me staying out of this, and you know what happens to people who testify in cases like yours.

Character 2 [en]: [defeated tone] You think I wanted this? You think I wanted to drag you into my nightmare? But that security footage is grainy, and without your testimony confirming I was defending myself, the jury will believe their narrative.

Character 1 [en]: Defending yourself? Marcus, you broke that man's jaw in three places, and even if he came at you first, [swallows hard], the prosecution has painted you as the aggressor.

Character 2 [en]: [urgently whispered] Because they don't know about his knife, the one you saw him pull before I ever touched him—the one that conveniently disappeared before the cops arrived.

Character 1 [en]: Even if I testified about the knife, they'd tear me apart on cross-examination, bring up my old arrests, make me look like just another unreliable witness from the neighborhood.

Character 2 [en]: [hollow whisper] So that's it.

Character 1 [en]: Your lawyer has other witnesses, other angles to work, and maybe the forensics will show something, maybe they'll find DNA evidence or, [sighs], I don't know, something that doesn't require me.

Character 2 [en]: [bitterly quiet] The other witnesses were all inside when it started, and forensics can't find evidence of a knife that someone made disappear—you know that as well as I do.

Character 1 [en]: [trembling] If I testify and they connect me to you, to your past, my ex will use it to take my kids away—she's already looking for any excuse.

Character 2 [en]: I have kids too. [pause]

Character 1 [en]: [quietly anguished] Don't do that, don't put that on me, because I've been carrying this guilt for weeks already, knowing what I know and staying silent.

Character 2 [en]: Then you do know it's wrong, keeping quiet when you could save an innocent man—when you could tell them the truth about what really happened out there. [voice cracking]

Character 1 [en]: [barely audible] Innocent.

Character 2 [en]: [desperately] In this case, yes, I'm innocent of what they're charging me with, and you know that because you were there, you saw him come at me with that blade.

Character 1 [en]: [resigned whisper] The recess is almost over, and if we're seen together, it won't matter what either of us says because they'll throw everything out on procedural grounds.

Character 2 [en]: [final plea] Just think about it, please—think about what you'd want if it was you sitting in that defendant's chair, knowing someone could save you but chose not to.
