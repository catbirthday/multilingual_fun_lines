=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: Ms. Chen, please sit down, we have some, mmm, rather pressing matters to discuss about your recent partnership deals in Eastern Europe. I believe you've been working with my associates without, uh, without knowing it.

Character 2 [en]: [nervous] I don't understand what you're talking about, who are you exactly? Security cleared you but they didn't mention anything about, um, about any Eastern European connections or associates or whatever this is.

Character 1 [en]: [calmly] The shipping company you partnered with last quarter, Baltic Logistics Solutions? That's mine. The payment processing firm you brought into your network, err, what was it called, TechPay International? Also mine.

Character 2 [en]: [voice rising] Those are legitimate businesses with clean paperwork and verified credentials, I did months of due diligence on each one! We ran background checks, financial audits, I mean, everything checked out perfectly.

Character 1 [en]: [amused] Of course everything checked out, Ms. Chen, I pay very talented people to ensure it does. You've been, hmm, instrumental in helping me move nearly forty million through your company's infrastructure. [chuckles] Quite efficient, actually.

Character 2 [en]: [barely breathing] Oh my god.

Character 1 [en]: Now, now, there's no need for panic here, you've done nothing technically illegal, have you? Every contract you signed was, well, perfectly legitimate on paper. [pause] The problem is what happens next.

Character 2 [en]: [shaky] Are you threatening me? Because I'll go straight to the FBI, I'll tell them everything about these companies and, and whatever you've been doing with our systems.

Character 1 [en]: That would be, mmm, remarkably unwise, considering your signature is on every single document, your emails praising these partnerships to your board. [sighs] Who do you think they'll believe orchestrated this?

Character 2 [en]: [desperately] I was doing my job, following protocols, there's no way anyone could pin this on me! I have records of every meeting, every email exchange, every single step of the vetting process.

Character 1 [en]: Yes, you certainly kept meticulous records, including the ones where you, uh, overlooked certain red flags to meet your quarterly targets. [rustling papers] This email here where you told compliance to expedite approval?

Character 2 [en]: [quieter] That was just about timing, we had a deadline for the merger and needed those partnerships active to show growth potential to investors.

Character 1 [en]: Exactly my point, Ms. Chen, you cut corners, and now you're going to continue managing these partnerships as if nothing has changed, aren't you?

Character 2 [en]: I can't just pretend I don't know what these companies really are! My entire career, my reputation, everything I've worked for could be destroyed if this comes out. [voice breaking]

Character 1 [en]: [firmly] Your reputation is already in my hands, the only question is whether you walk away with it intact or, well, whether you walk away at all.

Character 2 [en]: [trembling] You wouldn't actually... I have a family, two kids in college, my husband doesn't even know I'm here right now.

Character 1 [en]: [softer] I'm not a monster, Ms. Chen, I'm a businessman who values, mmm, discretion and cooperation. Continue doing your excellent work, and your family never needs to know about this conversation. [pause] Simple enough?

Character 2 [en]: [defeated whisper] Yes.

Character 1 [en]: [standing] Wonderful. Oh, and that new partnership proposal from Prague sitting on your desk? I'd strongly suggest you approve it by end of week.

Character 2 [en]: I understand, I'll, um, I'll make sure it goes through the proper channels and gets approved. [hollow laugh] Just another successful alliance, right?
