=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [mix]: [measured] डॉक्टर चेन, मैं जानती हूँ कि हम तीन घंटे से इसी बात पर घूम रहे हैं, लेकिन मुझे उन आखिरी सात मिनटों के बारे में फिर से बताइए—David के बेहोश होने से पहले—हर दवा, हर dose, every vital sign that you remember.

Character 2 [mix]: मैंने आपको वो सब कुछ बताया है जो मुझे याद है—14:42 पर midazolam के दो milligrams, फिर 14:44 पर propofol infusion शुरू हुआ, standard protocol for a colonoscopy. उसके vitals बिल्कुल perfect थे।

Character 1 [mix]: [sharply] जब तक वो खराब नहीं हो गए।

Character 2 [mix]: [defensive] देखिए, OR में कुछ हुआ था जब मैंने उसे surgical को सौंपा था, लेकिन मेरा काम हो चुका था—he was stable, properly sedated, और डॉक्टर Morrison ने वहाँ से संभाल लिया था।

Character 1 [mix]: [leaning forward] लेकिन डॉक्टर Morrison कहती हैं कि आप handoff के बाद चार मिनट और कमरे में रुकी थीं, which isn't standard protocol, is it? आप तो usually तुरंत निकल जाती हैं।

Character 2 [mix]: [hesitant] David ने मुझसे रुकने को कहा था—वो procedure से nervous था, बार-बार कह रहा था कि कुछ गलत लग रहा है even though all his numbers were perfect. [exhales] मुझे लगा वो बस anxious है।

Character 1 [mix]: उसे क्या गलत लग रहा था exactly? मुझे उसके exact words चाहिए, डॉक्टर चेन, आपकी interpretation नहीं।

Character 2 [mix]: [struggling] वो बार-बार कह रहा था कि कमरा बहुत ठंडा है, छाती में कुछ tight सा लग रहा है, but his O2 sat was ninety-eight percent और EKG में कुछ unusual नहीं था। [pause] बेहोश होने से ठीक पहले उसने मेरी कलाई पकड़ ली थी।

Character 1 [mix]: [quietly intense] आपने अपनी initial statement में ये detail छोड़ दी थी—कि उसने आपको physically पकड़ा था। जब उसने आपकी कलाई पकड़ी, तब क्या कहा था?

Character 2 [mix]: उसने कहा 'वो जानती है'—बस ये दो शब्द, बिल्कुल धीरे से—and then the propofol took full effect और वो बेहोश हो गया। मुझे लगा वो अपनी wife की बात कर रहा है, कि उसे procedure के बारे में पता है।

Character 1 [mix]: [carefully] जब उसने ये कहा था, तब उसकी wife को मरे छह महीने हो चुके थे, which you would have known अगर आपने सिर्फ surgical notes नहीं बल्कि उसकी full chart review की होती।

Character 2 [mix]: [shocked] मरी हुई? लेकिन emergency contact में Jennifer Walsh का नाम था, relationship: spouse. मैंने खुद उस नंबर पर call करके pickup arrangements confirm किए थे। [quieter] एक औरत ने phone उठाया था।

Character 1 [mix]: Jennifer Walsh उसकी business partner है जो पिछले एक साल से डॉक्टर Morrison के साथ affair कर रही है—something David discovered मरने से दो हफ्ते पहले।

Character 2 [mix]: [realizing] हे भगवान, जब उसने कहा 'वो जानती है,' वो medication से confused नहीं था—he was trying to tell me something about Morrison. [voice cracking] मुझे सुनना चाहिए था।

Character 1 [mix]: [grimly] Toxicology report में succinylcholine के traces मिले हैं, एक paralytic जो surgery के दौरान detect नहीं होता but fatal when combined with your propofol dose.

Character 2 [mix]: Succinylcholine तो हमारे surgical suite में रखा ही नहीं जाता, it's restricted to the ICU और निकालने के लिए dual sign-off चाहिए—किसी को deliberately लाना पड़ा होगा।

Character 1 [mix]: [determined] डॉक्टर Morrison के पास ICU का access है, and security footage shows her entering that unit David की surgery वाली सुबह 6 बजे, अपनी shift से तीन घंटे पहले।

Character 2 [mix]: [barely breathing] जब मैंने propofol push किया था, वो मेरे बिल्कुल पीछे खड़ी थी, close enough to inject something into his IV port. मुझे याद है मैं सोच रही थी कि वो बार-बार peripheral line क्यों check कर रही है।

Character 1 [mix]: मुझे जरूरत है कि आप अभी जो कुछ बताया है उसके बारे में testify करें, including David's last words और Morrison का IV के पास होना। [firmly] क्या आप कर सकती हैं?

Character 2 [mix]: [resolved] हाँ। David ने मुझे warn करने की कोशिश की थी और मैं fail हो गई, but I won't fail him again. [steadying breath] जो कुछ मैंने देखा था, सब कुछ बताऊंगी।


=== Original (English) ===

Character 1: [measured] Dr. Chen, I know we've been circling this for three hours, but I need you to walk me through those final seven minutes before David went under—every drug, every dose, every vital sign you remember.

Character 2: I've told you everything I can recall—two milligrams of midazolam at 14:42, followed by propofol infusion starting at 14:44, standard protocol for a colonoscopy. His vitals were textbook perfect.

Character 1: [sharply] Until they weren't.

Character 2: [defensive] Look, something happened in that OR after I handed him off to surgical, but my job was done—he was stable, properly sedated, and Dr. Morrison took over from there.

Character 1: [leaning forward] Except Dr. Morrison says you stayed in the room an extra four minutes after the handoff, which isn't standard protocol, is it? You usually leave immediately.

Character 2: [hesitant] David asked me to stay—he was nervous about the procedure, kept saying something felt wrong even though all his numbers were perfect. [exhales] I thought he was just anxious.

Character 1: What exactly did he say felt wrong? I need his exact words, Dr. Chen, not your interpretation of what you think he meant.

Character 2: [struggling] He kept saying the room felt too cold, that his chest felt tight, but his O2 sat was ninety-eight percent and his EKG showed nothing unusual. [pause] He grabbed my wrist right before going under.

Character 1: [quietly intense] You left that detail out of your initial statement—that he physically grabbed you. What did he say when he grabbed your wrist?

Character 2: He said 'she knows'—just those two words, barely a whisper—and then the propofol took full effect and he was out. I assumed he was talking about his wife knowing about the procedure.

Character 1: [carefully] His wife had been dead for six months when he said that, which you would have known if you'd reviewed his full chart instead of just the surgical notes.

Character 2: [shocked] Dead? But his emergency contact was listed as Jennifer Walsh, relationship: spouse. I called that number myself to confirm pickup arrangements. [quieter] A woman answered.

Character 1: Jennifer Walsh is his business partner who's been having an affair with Dr. Morrison for the past year—something David discovered two weeks before his death.

Character 2: [realizing] Oh God, when he said 'she knows,' he wasn't confused from the medication—he was trying to tell me something about Morrison. [voice cracking] I should have listened.

Character 1: [grimly] The toxicology report shows traces of succinylcholine in his system, a paralytic that would have been undetectable during surgery but fatal when combined with your propofol dose.

Character 2: Succinylcholine isn't even kept in our surgical suite, it's restricted to the ICU and requires dual sign-off to access—someone would have had to bring it in deliberately.

Character 1: [determined] Dr. Morrison has access to the ICU, and security footage shows her entering that unit at 6 AM the morning of David's surgery, three hours before her shift started.

Character 2: [barely breathing] She was standing right behind me when I pushed the propofol, close enough to inject something into his IV port. I remember thinking it was strange how she kept checking his peripheral line.

Character 1: I'm going to need you to testify about everything you just told me, including the detail about David's last words and Morrison's proximity to that IV. [firmly] Can you do that?

Character 2: [resolved] Yes. David tried to warn me and I failed him, but I won't fail him again. [steadying breath] I'll testify to everything I saw.
