Scenario: A welder confronts the electrical engineer whose faulty wiring specifications caused a workplace accident that injured three of the welder's crew members six months ago.

=== Translated Dialogue ===

Character 1 [en]: [coldly] Six months and you finally show your face at this site again, probably because corporate forced you to sign off on the repairs.

Character 2 [en]: Look, I don't need to explain myself to you—I submitted my designs according to code and if your crew had followed proper lockout procedures, nobody would have gotten hurt.

Character 1 [en]: [bitter laugh] Right, blame the guys who trusted your specs, the ones that said the circuit was rated for half the actual load it was carrying.

Character 2 [en]: The specifications were based on the information I was given by project management, and frankly, welders aren't qualified to evaluate electrical load calculations anyway.

Character 1 [en]: Marcus lost two fingers, Sandra's got permanent nerve damage in her left arm, and Tommy still wakes up screaming from the nightmares. [quieter] But sure, tell me more about your paperwork.

Character 2 [en]: Those injuries are unfortunate, but the investigation cleared me of any wrongdoing—the panel explicitly stated that multiple factors contributed to the incident.

Character 1 [en]: [scathing] Multiple factors, yeah, like you cutting corners to meet deadlines and signing off on work you never actually inspected because you were too important to leave your office.

Character 2 [en]: I inspected everything that was required by protocol, and I don't appreciate these accusations when you clearly don't understand the complexities of electrical system design.

Character 1 [en]: I understand that three people trusted me to keep them safe and I failed them because I believed your signature meant something. [exhales] Won't make that mistake again.

Character 2 [en]: [defensively] You want someone to blame because you can't accept that accidents happen in dangerous work environments, but targeting me won't change what happened.

Character 1 [en]: Accidents happen when equipment fails randomly, not when an engineer specifies 60-amp breakers for a 120-amp load because he couldn't be bothered to verify the actual machinery specs.

Character 2 [en]: [firmly] The machinery specifications provided to me indicated 60 amps, and I have the documentation to prove it—if someone changed the equipment later, that's not my responsibility.

Character 1 [en]: That documentation you're hiding behind had the model number wrong, which anyone who actually looked at the equipment would have caught immediately.

Character 2 [en]: Field verification wasn't part of my contracted scope, and honestly, if you were so concerned about safety, why didn't you raise these issues before the accident?

Character 1 [en]: [seething] Because I trusted that someone with a master's degree and fifteen years of experience would know the difference between a 3-phase and single-phase motor rating.

Character 2 [en]: The motor specifications in the database showed single-phase, and without a formal change order indicating otherwise, I had no reason to question it.

Character 1 [en]: [flatly] You had no reason.

Character 2 [en]: [exasperated] What do you want from me? An apology? An admission of guilt that my lawyers specifically advised against? I followed protocols, documented everything, and the company's insurance covered the damages.

Character 1 [en]: I wanted you to care that your mistake destroyed people's lives, but clearly that's too much to ask from someone who thinks human suffering is just an insurance claim. [walking away]

Character 2 [en]: [calling after] You think I don't care? I haven't designed a single system since without triple-checking every specification, but admitting fault means losing my license, my career, everything I've worked for—would that really help your crew?
