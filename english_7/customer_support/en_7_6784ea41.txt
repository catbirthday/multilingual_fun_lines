=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I just... I can't do this right now. There's a charge and it's gonna—

Customer Support: I hear you. Let me pull this up right away. What's the charge amount?

Customer: Ninety-seven dollars. My account has... um... twelve.

Customer Support: Okay. Got it. I see the pending charge here, transaction ID TXN-4428-BD. I'm going to make sure we handle this before anything hits your account.

Customer: Everything's just... I had my hours cut and then the car broke and now—

Customer Support: Listen. We're fixing this. Right now. The charge posts at midnight EST but I'm submitting reversal form RVS-8827 immediately.

Customer: Will that actually work? Because last time someone said they'd—no, wait, different company. Sorry.

Customer Support: This reversal? Guaranteed within 2 hours. Code RVS-8827 is priority level. So basically, your account stays positive. No overdraft.

Customer: I can't... I can't afford the thirty-five dollar fee. Not this week.

Customer Support: No fee. None. I'm adding overdraft protection waiver OPW-7763-X to your account right now. Covers you through the 15th.

Customer: The fifteenth? That's... that would actually help. A lot.

Customer Support: Good. Done. Also flagging your account with protection code PC-9982. Basically means any pending charges get reviewed first. No surprises.

Customer: I'm just so tired of everything being... um... being impossible.

Customer Support: I get it. I do. Look, I'm also setting up alert system ALS-4420. Texts you at 50, 25, and 10 dollar balance points.

Customer: You're actually helping. Most places just—they don't—sorry. Thank you.

Customer Support: That's what I'm here for. Your confirmation number is CFM-8827-RVS. Keep that. Any issues, reference it, they'll see everything I've done.

Customer: CFM... wait, can you repeat that? I need to write—

Customer Support: CFM-8827-RVS. Take your time. So also, there's a hardship program, application HRD-2001, reduces fees permanently.

Customer: I didn't know that existed. I qualify?

Customer Support: Based on what you've told me? Yes. Filing it now. Application tracking number ATN-5543-HRD. Decision in 24 hours but... between us? You're approved.
