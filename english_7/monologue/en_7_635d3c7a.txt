Subject: Your skeptic nature just proved your conspiracy theorist friend was actually right about something serious

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I can't believe I'm saying this. Marcus was right. [shocked] Marcus, of all people, with his boards covered in red string and his theories about everything— he was actually right. [pause] I spent months, literally months, fact-checking him, sending him Snopes articles, explaining confirmation bias. [regretful] And the whole time he was trying to warn me about something real. The documents are right here. I mean, I found them myself because I was trying to, um... I was trying to prove him wrong. [quietly] But it's all there. The transfers, the offshore accounts, the shell companies— exactly like he said. [anxious] What else was he right about? [short pause] No, no, I can't go down that road. But this one thing, this massive thing that affects thousands of people— [frustrated] God, I called him paranoid! I literally used the word "delusional" to his face. [apologetic] And he just kept showing me evidence that I wouldn't even look at because I'd already decided he was crazy. [very quietly] The worst part is, people are getting hurt because nobody believed him. Because I helped convince them not to believe him. [shaky voice] I need to call him. I need to— what do I even say? "Sorry for being an arrogant ass while you were trying to expose actual corruption"? [sigh] He's never going to let me live this down. And honestly? He shouldn't.
