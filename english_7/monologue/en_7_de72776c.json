[sigh] God, he would've been so proud. [very sad] I keep reaching for my phone to call him, you know? Like, muscle memory or something. [shaky voice] \"Hey, remember when you said I'd never amount to anything if I kept painting like that?\" [chuckle] He was right, obviously. Changed everything after that conversation. [warmly] Twenty-three years old and crying in his studio because he basically tore my entire portfolio apart. [laughing] But then he sat with me for, what, six hours? Teaching me how to really see light. [trailing off] And now they're calling it \"revolutionary\" and \"transformative\" and all these... [frustrated] Where were they five years ago when he was still—when we could've celebrated together? [pause] I mean, I know success takes time, but it's just... hmm, it feels so empty. [regretful] The speech they want me to give, I've been trying to write it and every draft just turns into a letter to him somehow. [crying while speaking] \"Thank you for believing in me when I was nobody,\" that sort of thing. [sniffle] Stupid, right? [quietly] Standing up there next week, accepting this thing he'll never see... I don't know if I can do it."
