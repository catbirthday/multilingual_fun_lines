[pause] Three years packing boxes, and Carlos taught me everything—how to stack them so they wouldn't fall, which tape works best, all of it. [sad] And now they want me to, um... to let him go. Him and Maria and Tommy. [frustrated] The whole crew that trained me, basically. They said it's \"restructuring\" or whatever corporate bullshit— [sigh] Sorry, I just—how am I supposed to walk in there tomorrow? [anxious] Like, \"Hey guys, thanks for teaching me everything, oh and by the way, you're all fired.\" [bitter] Twenty-eight dollars an hour they're offering me. That's what, mmm, seven dollars more than I make now? [crying while speaking] Carlos has three kids. Maria just bought that house, she was so— [pause] God, she was so excited about that house. [angry] And they knew! They knew when they offered me this position what they were asking me to do. [very quietly] I keep thinking maybe I should just... turn it down? But then what? [regretful] Someone else does it and I'm still making twenty-one an hour and they're gone anyway. [shaky voice] This isn't how I wanted things to go."
