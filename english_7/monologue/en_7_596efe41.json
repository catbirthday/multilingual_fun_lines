And I'm sitting here staring at my phone like— what am I supposed to do with this? [pause] I mean, I've told the story a thousand times. How she made my life hell. How I survived it, how it made me stronger. [very slowly] That's literally what I talk about in my therapy groups. [sarcastic] \"Look at me, I'm proof you can overcome anything.\" [sigh] But now she's sorry? Now she gets it? And the worst part is, um... the worst part is she sounds genuine. Like she actually understands what she did. [frustrated] Which should feel good, right? Closure or whatever? But instead I just feel... [trailing off] I don't know. Empty? Like she just took something from me. Again. [very quietly] Because if she's not the monster I made her out to be, then what does that make my whole story? [pause] What does that make me?"
