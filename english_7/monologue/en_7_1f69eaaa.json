The Rosewood Estate, with the, um... with the oak trees creating this natural archway over the ceremony space. [pause] Six months I've been looking for a venue like this. Six months of dead ends and disappointments, and now—ha. [laugh] Now that Ryan texts me this morning saying he can't do this anymore, that he needs space, that we're moving too fast... [very sad] Now I find the perfect spot.\n\nI mean, the light coming through those branches at sunset? [sigh] It's exactly what I'd imagined for... well. Doesn't matter now, does it? [pause] The coordinator was so excited, showing me around, talking about how couples cry when they see it for the first time. And I'm standing there thinking, mmm, yeah, I might cry too but not for the reason you think. [shaky voice] This stone pathway leading to the gazebo, it's like something out of a fairy tale. \n\n[crying while speaking] I should be happy. My client's going to love this place. [sniffle] But all I can see is what we were supposed to have. What I thought we were going to have. [long pause] God, I need to pull it together before I call them."
