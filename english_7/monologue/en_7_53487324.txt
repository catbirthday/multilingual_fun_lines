=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I can't... I can't believe this is real. [short pause] Okay, so I was trying to debunk Jake's whole thing about the water treatment plant, right? Like I always do. I went through all the public records, the EPA reports, everything. [anxious] And there's this gap. Three years of data just... missing. Not classified, not redacted—missing. [gasp softly] Then I found this invoice from 2019. [very quietly] They were buying industrial-grade fluoride compounds that aren't even approved for municipal use. 

[frustrated] God, Jake's been saying this for two years! And I just kept telling him he was being paranoid. I'd literally laugh at him, you know? Call him a tinfoil hat guy. [regretful] But the chemical signatures match exactly what he said they would. The, um... the neurological effects he kept warning about? [trailing off] There's actually studies that...

[scared] What the hell do I do with this? I mean, who do I even tell? [laugh] Jake's gonna be so insufferably smug about this. [very slowly] But if he was right about this, then what else... [long pause] No. No, I can't go down that road. [whispering] Except now I kind of have to, don't I?
