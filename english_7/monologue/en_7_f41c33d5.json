[laugh] Three years of being Background Extra Number Four, standing in fake rain, pretending to have conversations with no sound... and the whole time I was, um, I was basically going to film school for free. [chuckle] Every setup, every lighting change, I'd watch the DP work. The way they'd block scenes, how the director would give notes—I mean, I soaked it all up. \n\n[warm] And now here I am with an actual option deal. Me! The person who spent, what, six months just holding a coffee cup in the background of that medical drama? [pause] Honestly, I think that's when it clicked. Watching them shoot the same scene seventeen times, seeing how they'd adjust the dialogue, how they'd—hmm, how they'd find the emotional truth in these tiny moments. \n\n[very sincerely] I went home that night and started writing. Just... poured everything onto the page. All those observations, all those hours of waiting around and listening to writers argue about character arcs. [trailing off] God, my mom's gonna freak when I tell her... \n\n[relieved] Three thousand dollars for the option. That's, um, that's more money than I made in background work last year. [extremely happy] This is actually happening!"
