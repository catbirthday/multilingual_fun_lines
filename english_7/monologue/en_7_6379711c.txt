=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp loudly] Oh my God. Oh my God, they actually—they actually called me. [very excited] The actual production designer from the actual Marvel movie just called ME about MY work! [pause] I mean, I knew the Victorian pocket watch collection was good but... wow, apparently the way I aged the brass hinges? [laugh] That's what caught their eye! They said—wait, what did they say exactly—they said nobody else would have thought to match the patina to the, um, the specific oxidation patterns from 1890s London fog. [extremely happy] Six months of research on Victorian metallurgy actually paid off! [nervous] Oh God, but now I have to... I have to fly to Atlanta next week. [anxious] What if I'm not ready for something this big? What if they realize I'm just, you know, some person who got obsessed with historical accuracy and— [pause] No. No, you know what? [confidently] I earned this. Every single antique shop I haunted, every museum archive I begged my way into, all those nights recreating period-accurate wear patterns... [laugh loudly] I'm going to work on a Marvel movie! [very quietly] Mom's going to absolutely flip when I tell her.
