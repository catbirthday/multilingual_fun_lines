Subject: Your oyster harvesting lease getting revoked because of pollution you had nothing to do with but can't afford to fight legally

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] Twenty-three years. Twenty-three years I've been working those beds, and they just— they just revoke it like that. [pause] The runoff from that chemical plant upstream, it's been poisoning everything for months now. [frustrated] Everyone knows it's them! The tests show it, the dead fish show it, but somehow my little operation is the one that gets shut down? [sigh] My grandfather started this lease in 1962. [very melancholic] Three generations of my family, just gone because I can't afford a lawyer to fight them. The big companies, they have teams of attorneys, and me? [bitter laugh] I've got twelve hundred dollars in savings and a mortgage I won't be able to pay next month. [upset] You know what kills me? Those oysters were thriving before all this started. Best harvest I'd seen in years, actually. [pause] And now they're dying, and I'm not even allowed to go check on them. [exhausted] The water quality reports are right there, showing exactly when the contamination started, but the appeals process alone costs more than I make in, um... in half a year. [very quietly] I keep thinking maybe I should just sell the boat. [angry] But then what? Start over at fifty-three? [trailing off] My daughter was supposed to take over someday, you know? [very sad] She learned to shuck oysters before she could ride a bike. [long pause] God, how do I even tell her it's over?
