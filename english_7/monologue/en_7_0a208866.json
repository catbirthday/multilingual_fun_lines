The grant, the recognition, all of it. [sigh] Everything she said would happen. \n\nI keep, um... I keep wanting to call her. [sad] Like my hand actually reached for my phone before I remembered. She always said—god, she was so sure about this, you know? \"Just wait,\" she'd tell me. \"They'll see it eventually.\" [shaky voice] And I'd get so frustrated with her optimism.\n\n[regretful] The thing is, I almost quit. Like three months before she got sick, I was ready to just... throw it all away. And she sat with me for, hmm, must've been four hours? Going through every single piece, showing me what she saw. [pause] \n\n[crying while speaking] She won't even know. That's the part that's just—how is that fair? Everyone's congratulating me and I can't even... [sniffle] I can't tell the one person who believed in it before anyone else did. [very quietly] Before I did, honestly.\n\n[exhausted] I thought this would feel different. I really did."
