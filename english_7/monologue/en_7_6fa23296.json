[laugh] Every single order, packed, labeled, shipped. Guys, this has never happened in the twenty-three years I've been here. Never. [relieved] I mean, usually we're here till, what, Christmas Eve at like midnight? Remember last year when, uh... when Marcus fell asleep standing up at his station? [chuckle] And now look at us! [short pause] Honestly, I didn't think we'd pull it off. When corporate said they expected thirty percent more orders this year, I was like, mmm, there's no way. But somehow we just... we found this rhythm, you know? [warm] Everyone just clicked. The new sorting system, the way we reorganized the floor, it all just worked. [pause] I'm so proud of you all. Seriously. [emotional] We should, um... we should celebrate or something. [speeding up] Wait, does this mean we actually get to enjoy the holidays for once? Like, actually see our families? [extremely happy] Oh man, my kids are gonna flip when I tell them I'll be home for dinner every night this week!"
