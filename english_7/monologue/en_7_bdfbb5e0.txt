=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Three people. Three... three actual people are dead because of— [pause] because of what I did. [very quietly] They had names. Marcus from accounting. Sarah who just started in marketing. And... and Raj. [gasp softly] Oh god, Raj had kids. Two little girls. [pause] I remember seeing their photos on his desk when I— when I announced the restructuring. [regretful] How did I not see this coming? The mandatory overtime, the performance reviews every week, the— the constant threats about layoffs if quotas weren't met. I thought I was being... I thought I was pushing for excellence. [bitter] Excellence. Jesus Christ, what kind of monster— [crying while speaking] They tried to tell me. HR sent those wellness reports and I just... I filed them away. Said we'd address it next quarter. Always next quarter. [very sad] Sarah left a note apparently. Said she couldn't take another day of feeling worthless. Worthless. That's the culture I created. [shaky voice] Three people are gone forever because I wanted better profit margins. Because I wanted to impress the board. [very quietly] What am I supposed to do with this? How do you— how do you live with something like this?
