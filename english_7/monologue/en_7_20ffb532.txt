=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [very quietly] They gave me the paper today. Exonerated. [bitter] Ten years of my life, and they hand me a piece of paper like it's... like it's some kind of gift. [pause] I kept thinking about this moment, you know? [hopeful] Walking out and seeing everyone waiting for me. [laugh] Mom with her arms open, Dad trying not to cry, Jamie running up like when she was little. [very sad] But there was just... nobody. [sigh] 

I called the house and some stranger answered. [confused] They sold it three years ago, apparently. [angry] Three years! And nobody thought to, I don't know, tell me? [frustrated] Mom's in Florida now with her new husband—yeah, new husband. [cry] Dad doesn't even return my calls anymore. [shaky voice] And Jamie, she's... she's twenty-three now. [very melancholic] Has a baby. A whole baby I've never met. 

[hesitantly] I mean, I get it, I guess? Ten years is... it's a long time. [regretful] People have to move on, right? They couldn't just stop living because I was— [trailing off] But I thought... [long pause] I really thought they'd wait for me. [crying while speaking] I thought family meant something more than that.
