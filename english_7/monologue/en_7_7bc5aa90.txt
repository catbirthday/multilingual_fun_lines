=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] They put my breastplate behind glass. The one I spent three months on, hammering every rivet by hand. And the placard says... hmm, it says "exceptional craftsmanship" like that's supposed to make me feel—I don't know, proud? [pause] I mean, I was proud, back then. Every piece I made, I thought I was, um... I thought I was protecting someone's son, someone's father. [regretful] But looking at it now, in this room full of... God, all these photographs of the dead. [sniffle] They're displaying my work like it's art, but it's—it's not art when you know whose blood was on it. [very quietly] I remember when Captain Morris brought it back. The dent right there, see? That's where the bullet... [trailing off] [long pause] I keep thinking, what if I'd been a carpenter instead? Built houses, not—not this. [sad] The museum director, she keeps saying how important it is to preserve history, and I get that, I really do, but... oof, standing here, it just feels like I'm looking at all my mistakes polished up and lit perfectly. [sigh] Twenty-seven years I did this work. Twenty-seven years of conflicts that should've been conversations.
