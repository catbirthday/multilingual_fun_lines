Subject: Getting the recognition you always wanted for your work, but only after the person who inspired you passed away

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] They're calling it "groundbreaking." The same work they ignored for, what, seven years? And now suddenly it's... [pause] I got the call yesterday. The grant, the recognition, all of it. [sigh] Everything she said would happen. 

I keep, um... I keep wanting to call her. [sad] Like my hand actually reached for my phone before I remembered. She always said—god, she was so sure about this, you know? "Just wait," she'd tell me. "They'll see it eventually." [shaky voice] And I'd get so frustrated with her optimism.

[regretful] The thing is, I almost quit. Like three months before she got sick, I was ready to just... throw it all away. And she sat with me for, hmm, must've been four hours? Going through every single piece, showing me what she saw. [pause] 

[crying while speaking] She won't even know. That's the part that's just—how is that fair? Everyone's congratulating me and I can't even... [sniffle] I can't tell the one person who believed in it before anyone else did. [very quietly] Before I did, honestly.

[exhausted] I thought this would feel different. I really did.
