Every single location is going to use my system! \n\nI keep thinking I'm going to wake up or something because this is... I mean, three years ago I was literally scrubbing dishes and watching people get sick from cross-contamination and nobody would listen. [frustrated] Nobody cared that I had ideas, you know? \n\n[pause] \n\nBut I kept the data. Every incident, every temperature log, I was basically obsessed. My roommate thought I was, um... she thought I'd lost it honestly. [laugh] And maybe I had? I don't know, spending weekends designing filtration protocols isn't exactly normal.\n\n[warm] God, when they showed me the projections though... We're talking about preventing thousands—no, tens of thousands of cases. Real people who won't spend their nights throwing up because of something we could have prevented all along. Kids who won't end up in the ER.\n\n[shaky voice] My mom always said I worried too much about everything. [sniffle] But sometimes, I guess... sometimes worrying about the right things actually matters? \n\n[extremely happy] I did this. Me. The dishwasher who wouldn't shut up about safety protocols. [laugh loudly] I actually did this!"
