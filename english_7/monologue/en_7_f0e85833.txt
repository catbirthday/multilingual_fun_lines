Subject: Your informant work finally taking down the corrupt cop while destroying your faith in the system

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] They finally got him. Martinez is done. Three years of wearing a wire, three years of— [bitter] God, I can't even celebrate it properly. You know what the worst part is? It wasn't just him. [pause] When they went through his files, his contacts, it was like... it was everyone. The captain who kept reassigning cases. The DA who dropped charges. Even the, um, even the judge who threw out that evidence last year. [very quietly] They all knew. They all knew and they just let it happen. [angry] Twenty years I believed in this system! Twenty years thinking if we just got the bad apples out— [sigh] But it's not bad apples when the whole damn tree is rotten, is it? [sad] I keep thinking about all those families who came to us for help. We told them to trust the process. To have faith. [pause] Martinez is going to prison, yeah. But the captain? Early retirement with full pension. The judge? Still on the bench. [hesitantly] And me? I'm the snitch who broke the thin blue line. Can't work in this city anymore. Can't, um... can't even look at a badge the same way. [very melancholic] Justice. What a joke.
