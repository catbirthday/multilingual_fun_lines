Scenario: A hit-and-run victim encounters the spirit of the drunk driver who killed them both in the same accident, trapped together at the intersection where it happened.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] You're the one who hit me, aren't you? [pause] I can feel it radiating off you like heat from a fire, that crushing guilt you're carrying around even in death.

Character 2: [very quietly] I've been waiting here at this intersection for three years, watching every car pass through, hoping somehow you'd come back so I could tell you how sorry I am.

Character 1: [bitter] Sorry doesn't bring back my daughter who was in the backseat. [trembling] She was only seven, singing along to the radio one second and then just gone because you couldn't call a cab.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] I know.

Character 1: [angry] You don't get to cry about this! [loudly] My husband still drives to her school every morning before remembering she's not there anymore, still buys her favorite cereal at the grocery store.

Character 2: [monotone] I died in that crash too, trapped in my car watching yours burn while the sirens got closer. [exhales] Every night I relive those seventeen minutes before the paramedics arrived.

Character 1: [frustrated] Good, I hope you suffer every second of whatever existence this is. [pause] Do you know what it's like being stuck between worlds because you can't let go of your anger?

Character 2: [empathetically] That's why we're both here, isn't it? [sighs] Neither of us can move on because we're chained to this moment, this intersection, this horrible mistake I made.

Character 1: [shaky voice] Sometimes I see her here too, my Emma, standing by the stop sign like she's waiting for me to pick her up from school.

Character 2: She told me you'd come eventually. [very quietly] She said you just needed time to be angry first, that the anger was keeping you warm.

Character 1: [gasps] You've spoken to her? [desperately] Where is she, is she okay, does she understand why mommy can't come get her?

Character 2: She's not stuck like we are. [warmly] She comes and goes as she pleases, says she's waiting for you to be ready to go with her to wherever comes next.

Character 1: I can't forgive you. [firmly] I need you to know that, I will never forgive you for taking her from me, from her father, from the life she should have had.

Character 2: [regretful] I'm not asking for forgiveness, just for you to know that she's at peace even if we're not. [pause] She doesn't blame either of us.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] How can she not blame us? [very quietly] I was supposed to protect her, I was her mother, and I couldn't even shield her from the impact.

Character 2: [gently] She said love doesn't work that way, that it transcends blame and anger and all the heavy things we carry. [sighs] She's wise for someone so young.

Character 1: [exhausted] I'm so tired of being angry, of replaying that night, of wishing I'd taken a different route home or left five minutes later.

Character 2: [softly] Me too.

Character 1: [hesitantly] If I let go of this anger, if I stop hating you with every part of whatever I am now, will I still be her mother? [pause] Will she still know me?

Character 2: [very sincerely] She says you'll always be her mother, that nothing can change that, not death, not anger, not forgiveness. [warmly] She's waiting just beyond that light you keep ignoring, ready when you are.
