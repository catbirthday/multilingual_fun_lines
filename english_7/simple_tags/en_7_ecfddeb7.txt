=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] You're the technician?

Character 2: Yeah, I'm here to assess the damage and install a new meter. [pause] The police report said it was intentional destruction, spray paint and a baseball bat apparently.

Character 1: [shaky voice] I'm so sorry about what Tyler did to your equipment. [quietly] I know an apology doesn't fix anything, but I wanted to meet you in person before you started the work, to at least try to explain.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Look, ma'am, I appreciate you coming out here, but this is the third meter I've had destroyed this month. [sighs] Kids think it's funny to mess with utility equipment, not realizing someone has to fix it.

Character 1: [frustrated] He's not my biological son, I've only been his stepmother for two years, and honestly, I don't know how to reach him anymore. [voice breaking] His father works overseas contracts, gone eight months out of twelve, and Tyler blames me for everything wrong in his life.

Character 2: [bitter] That meter he destroyed was one I'd just installed last week, took me three hours in ninety-degree heat to get it properly calibrated. [quietly] My supervisor's threatening to dock my pay for the replacement costs since it happened on my route.

Character 1: [apologetic] We'll cover everything, all the costs, your time, whatever penalties there are. [anxiously] I've already talked to our lawyer about restitution, and Tyler's going to work all summer to pay it back, though he doesn't know that yet.

Character 2: [slowly] You know what really gets me? I have a seventeen-year-old son too, and [sighs] last year he got caught shoplifting because his friends dared him to.

Character 1: [surprised] You have a teenager? [empathetically] Then you understand how they can just suddenly become these strangers living in your house, angry at the world and taking it out on anyone nearby.

Character 2: [warmly] The shoplifting wasn't even about the stuff, it was about his mom and me divorcing. [pause] Kids don't know how to process big emotions, so they break things instead.

Character 1: [relieved] That's exactly it, Tyler's mom died three years ago, and his dad remarried me so fast, and now [trembling] I'm trying to parent this kid who sees me as the enemy who replaced his mother.

Character 2: [confidently] My son's doing better now, working part-time, staying out of trouble. Sometimes they just need to hit bottom before they can start climbing back up.

Character 1: [very quietly] I keep wondering if I should just leave, let his father deal with this when he gets back from Kuwait, but that feels like abandoning Tyler when [sighs] maybe what he needs is someone who won't give up on him.

Character 2: Ma'am, I'm going to be honest with you, the fact that you're here, talking to me directly instead of just sending a check through your insurance, that says something about the kind of person you are.

Character 1: Tyler doesn't even know I'm here, he'd probably be mortified, but I needed to do this for myself too, to feel like I'm doing something constructive instead of just yelling and grounding him over and over.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Look, I do youth mentoring through my church on weekends. [quietly] If Tyler needs someone to talk to who isn't family, who's been through some stuff, I could give you my card.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] You'd do that? After what he did to your equipment? [gratefully] I don't even know what to say, that's incredibly generous of you.

Character 2: [formal] I need to get this meter installed before my next appointment, but think about it. [warmly] Sometimes kids listen better to strangers than family.

Character 1: [sincerely] Thank you for not just seeing us as another problem household. [pause] I'll talk to Tyler tonight, see if he's open to meeting you properly, under better circumstances.

Character 2: [chuckling] Better circumstances than vandalism? Yeah, that'd be good.
