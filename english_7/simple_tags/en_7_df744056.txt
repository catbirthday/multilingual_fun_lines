Scenario: A shipping clerk drives through the night to deliver an urgent legal document to their estranged sibling, a ski instructor at a mountain resort, only to discover the sibling has just suffered a career-ending injury.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [exhausted] I've been driving since midnight to get this package to you, and the resort people at the front desk said you'd be here in the medical wing. [pause] They wouldn't tell me why you're not out on the slopes.

Character 2: [bitter] So after four years of nothing, you show up with a delivery? [quietly] Could've just left it at the desk like any normal courier would do instead of hunting me down.

Character 1: [frustrated] This isn't a normal delivery, it's from Dad's estate lawyer and it required personal signature within forty-eight hours. [sighs] Trust me, I wouldn't be here if there was any other option.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Dad's estate? He's been dead for six months and they're just now sending things? [laughs] Perfect timing, really, just absolutely perfect considering everything else.

Character 1: You're wearing a knee brace and your instructor jacket is hanging on that IV stand instead of on your shoulders, so clearly something happened that nobody bothered to mention to me.

Character 2: [very quietly] Tore my ACL and MCL three days ago on a routine run with a student. [pause] Twenty years of skiing and I wipe out on a beginner slope.

Character 1: Jesus, that's your whole career right there, isn't it? The thing you left everything behind for, including the family shipping business that Dad wanted you to take over.

Character 2: The doctors say I'll never ski professionally again, might walk with a permanent limp if the surgery doesn't go perfectly. [trembling] So yeah, the career I chose over family is done.

Character 1: [hesitantly] Look, I know we haven't talked since Dad's funeral, but this package, it's [exhales] apparently there's something in his will about the business that involves both of us.

Character 2: Both of us? He made it crystal clear I was dead to him when I refused to take over the warehouse operations. [angry] Now what, he wants to twist the knife from beyond the grave?

Character 1: [softly] Actually, no.

Character 2: [confused] The letter inside says he left the entire business in both our names, fifty-fifty split, but only if we run it together for at least one year. [slowly] Otherwise it gets sold and the money goes to charity.

Character 1: [frustrated] That manipulative old bastard, he knew exactly what he was doing, didn't he? [sighs] Forcing us back together when I can barely stand to look at you.

Character 2: [quietly] You can barely stand to look at me? [louder] You're the one who told me I was selfish for following my dreams instead of staying in that windowless warehouse.

Character 1: I was twenty-two and watching Dad cry because his favorite kid abandoned him for powder snow and tourist tips. [pause] What was I supposed to say?

Character 2: [bitter] You were supposed to understand that not everyone wants to spend their life tracking packages and managing inventory systems. [softly] But now I guess that's exactly where I'm headed anyway.

Character 1: [exhausted] We have seventy-two hours to decide according to this paperwork, and I've already been running the place solo for six months while you were living your mountain dream.

Character 2: [shaky voice] A dream that just ended with me probably needing a cane before I'm forty. [sighs] Maybe Dad knew something we didn't about timing.

Character 1: [hesitantly] The business has actually grown since you left, three new contracts with tech companies shipping specialized equipment. [quietly] Could use someone who understands customer service better than I do.

Character 2: [very quietly] So we're really going to do this? [pause] Go back to that warehouse and pretend the last four years of silence didn't happen while we sort packages together?
