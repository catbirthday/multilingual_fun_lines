=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: How long have I been here now? Twenty-eight days?

Character 2: Hmm, actually it's thirty-two days today, which is, you know, pretty remarkable when you think about it—that's over a month of choosing yourself every single morning, and I'm curious what that feels like for you right now.

Character 1: It feels like prison honestly.

Character 2: Yeah, I get that, I really do. But here's something interesting—you've mentioned the number seven a lot in our sessions, like, seven years using, seven failed attempts at quitting, seven people you hurt... what do you think that pattern means to you?

Character 1: I never noticed that before. That's weird.

Character 2: Right? Numbers can be, um, really revealing sometimes. Speaking of which, you told me yesterday you wanted to make it to your daughter's eighteenth birthday, and that's in, what, four months? So let's talk about what those hundred and twenty days could look like.

Character 1: If I even make it that long.

Character 2: [delighted] Oh, but see, that's the thing—you just said "if" instead of "when I relapse," which is actually huge progress from two weeks ago when you were, uh, absolutely certain you'd fail by day fourteen, remember?

Character 1: You keep track of everything I say?

Character 2: Well, not everything, but the important stuff, yeah. Like how you've gone from zero hope to, mm, maybe fifteen percent hope, which might not sound like much but that's literally infinite growth from nothing, mathematically speaking.

Character 1: [whispering] Sometimes I count the ceiling tiles at night. Forty-eight.

Character 2: Gosh, that's... okay, so you're lying there counting to forty-eight over and over? That sounds like your brain is, er, trying to create some order in all this chaos, which makes total sense honestly.

Character 1: It helps me not think about using.

Character 2: [playful] Forty-eight ceiling tiles versus, hmm, let's see, probably ten thousand intrusive thoughts a day? Those tiles are doing some heavy lifting there, but hey, whatever works, right? Have you tried counting backwards from forty-eight?

Character 1: [passionately] I want my life back! I want those seven years back!

Character 2: Woof, yeah, that's—that's the real want right there, isn't it? Not just sobriety but actual time, and I mean, we can't get those years back but we can, um, maybe reclaim what they took from you in other ways.

Character 1: What if I've only got seven years left to live?

Character 2: Okay so, that's interesting—you're stuck on seven again. But look, even if that were true, which, you know, statistically at thirty-four you've probably got like forty-plus years ahead, but even seven years is, what, over two thousand days to rebuild everything?

Character 1: You make it sound so simple with your numbers.

Character 2: Ha, no, it's not simple at all—these numbers are just, I guess, scaffolding to help us see the shape of what you actually want, which seems to be, erm, not just time but meaningful time, time that counts for something, yeah?
