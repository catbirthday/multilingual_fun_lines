=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [very sincerely] Coach, I need to tell you something about my dive today.

Character 2: [laugh hysterically] Oh god, don't tell me you belly flopped again! I mean, last week was, uh, spectacular in the worst possible way, but hey, at least you're consistent with your entries, right?

Character 1: No, actually I nailed the inward two-and-a-half.

Character 2: [sigh] Wait, seriously? You've been struggling with that dive for, what, three months now? That's, um, that's actually incredible because I was starting to think we might need to switch you to something simpler for regionals.

Character 1: [laugh loudly] Three and a half months, but who's counting?

Character 2: Okay so, walk me through it—what clicked? Because yesterday you were, mmm, basically doing a weird sideways tumble thing that was honestly kind of terrifying to watch from the deck.

Character 1: [friendly] Sarah gave me a tip about keeping my chin tucked.

Character 2: Oh right, yeah, Sarah knows her stuff. She competed at, uh, nationals twice before her shoulder injury, and honestly she probably understands the mechanics better than I do sometimes, which is kind of embarrassing to admit.

Character 1: [pause] Do you think I'm ready for Saturday's meet?

Character 2: Hmm, well, here's the thing—you've got your basic dives down solid, and now apparently the inward is working too. I'd say, like, if you can hit that same dive consistently tomorrow, then yeah, absolutely you're ready.

Character 1: What if I choke?

Character 2: Geez, okay, everyone chokes sometimes, right? The trick is to, um, basically forget about the crowd and just treat it like practice. Plus you'll have the whole team there, which usually helps with nerves and stuff.

Character 1: The whole team?

Character 2: [mumbling] Well, technically not Jake because he's got that family thing, but literally everyone else committed to coming, which is, you know, pretty cool considering it's an away meet and all.

Character 1: Even the seniors who graduated?

Character 2: [meow] Sorry, that was weird—I just, uh, accidentally made a cat sound? Anyway yeah, Marcus and Lily said they're driving down together, which is sweet because they really want to support you guys even though they're, like, drowning in college coursework right now.

Character 1: That's actually really nice of them.

Character 2: Dang, I know, right? This team has always been, sort of, more like a family than just a sports thing. People actually care about each other here, which is apparently pretty rare according to coaches at other schools.

Character 1: Should I practice the inward one more time today?

Character 2: Nah, you nailed it once, so let's end on that high note, alright? Tomorrow we'll run through it a few times, but for now, I mean, just visualize it tonight and trust that your body knows what to do.
