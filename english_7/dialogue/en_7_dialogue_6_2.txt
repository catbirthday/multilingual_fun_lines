=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: When did you get your first smartphone?

Character 2: [formal] I held out until 2014, actually. Everyone thought I was insane for resisting that long, but I genuinely didn't see the point until apps became basically mandatory for everything.

Character 1: What finally convinced you?

Character 2: [stuttering] W-well, my bank stopped letting me d-deposit checks at the ATM. They said I had to use the m-mobile app or physically go inside during business hours, which was, um, basically impossible with my work schedule.

Character 1: Do you think we adopt tech too quickly now?

Character 2: Hmm, honestly? Sometimes yeah. We jump on things before really understanding the implications—like, remember when everyone was putting Alexa in their homes without thinking about privacy?

Character 1: [laugh hard] Oh god, my mom still talks to hers like it's a person!

Character 2: That's actually pretty common though! Older generations often anthropomorphize tech to make it less intimidating. My dad says "please" and "thank you" to his GPS, which is, I mean, kind of endearing really.

Character 1: [furious] But companies exploit that! They design it to feel human specifically to manipulate us!

Character 2: Sure, absolutely. They use conversational interfaces and, uh, friendly voices to lower our guard. Makes us forget we're handing over massive amounts of personal data to corporations who definitely don't have our best interests at heart.

Character 1: [whispering loudly] My neighbor thinks her smart TV is listening to her all the time.

Character 2: Well, she's not entirely wrong. Most smart TVs do have always-on microphones for voice commands, and there've been documented cases of them collecting way more data than they, er, technically need to function.

Character 1: [singing] What about electric cars? Are they really the future?

Character 2: Eesh, that's complicated. The tech is impressive but the infrastructure isn't there yet—charging stations are still pretty sparse outside major cities, and the grid can barely handle current demand in some places.

Character 1: My uncle refuses to even consider one.

Character 2: Yeah, lots of people feel that way. Range anxiety is real, plus there's this whole cultural attachment to combustion engines that's, like, surprisingly deep for some folks.

Character 1: What tech do you think we'll resist next?

Character 2: Brain-computer interfaces, probably. Once they move beyond medical applications, people are going to freak out about the idea of, um, literally plugging their thoughts into a network. And honestly? They'd have good reason to be concerned.

Character 1: [empathetically] It must be exhausting, constantly adapting to new technology.

Character 2: Oh, it really is. Every few years there's some new thing you have to learn or risk being left behind professionally and socially. The pace of change is, frankly, unsustainable for most people's mental health.
