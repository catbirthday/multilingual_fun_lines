=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: The S&P 500 closed at 4,783.45 today. That's a 0.73% gain from yesterday's close.

Character 2: Nice uptick there. The tech sector's been carrying the whole market lately, especially with NVIDIA crushing earnings expectations. Their AI chip demand is basically printing money at this point.

Character 1: NVIDIA's P/E ratio is 65.2. That's historically high, even for growth stocks.

Character 2: Sure, but you're— no wait, you can't just look at P/E in isolation anymore. These AI plays are trading on future potential, not current earnings. The addressable market for AI chips could be in the trillions by 2030.

Character 1: I placed a limit order for 100 shares of AAPL at $189.50.

Character 2: Smart move setting a limit there. Apple's been bouncing between 188 and 192 for weeks now. If it dips to your price point, you're getting in at solid support.

Character 1: My stop-loss triggered on TSLA at $238. Lost $1,247.

Character 2: Ah, that hurts. Tesla's been so choppy lately with all the— the price war stuff in China and Musk's constant Twitter drama. Sometimes stop-losses save you from worse, sometimes they knock you out right before a bounce.

Character 1: What's your take on the— the Fed minutes? Rate cuts coming?

Character 2: The language is definitely shifting dovish. They're talking about "balanced risks" now instead of just inflation concerns. Markets are pricing in March for the first cut, but honestly, I think they'll wait until May to see more data.

Character 1: I've been dollar-cost averaging into VOO. $500 every two weeks.

Character 2: [flirtatious] Ooh, nothing sexier than disciplined index investing, seriously. You're basically guaranteed to beat 90% of active traders over the long term with that strategy. Slow and steady wins the race.

Character 1: My friend thinks— thinks he can day trade crypto and retire by 30.

Character 2: Oh god, I've heard that story a thousand times. The statistics are brutal—something like 95% of day traders lose money. Your friend's competing against algorithms that execute trades in microseconds.

Character 1: I sold my AMZN position yesterday at $178.92. Profit of $4,300.

Character 2: Nice timing! Taking profits is— is never a bad move, especially after that run-up. Amazon's been on fire since they announced the new AWS pricing structure. You keeping any or going completely cash?

Character 1: Keeping 30% cash. Waiting for a correction.

Character 2: That's actually— yeah, that's prudent. We haven't had a real pullback in months, valuations are stretched, and there's still the commercial real estate bomb waiting to go off. Cash gives you options when things get volatile.

Character 1: Options? I don't— I don't touch derivatives. Too risky.

Character 2: Completely understand that. Options can blow up accounts faster than anything if you don't know what you're doing. Stick with what you understand—that's Buffett's first rule and it's kept him rich for decades.
