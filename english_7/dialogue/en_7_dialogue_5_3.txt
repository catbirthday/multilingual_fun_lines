=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Did you know octopuses have three hearts?

Character 2: Wait, seriously? Three hearts? That's absolutely wild. I knew they had blue blood because of the copper, but three hearts is something else entirely.

Character 1: Yeah, two pump blood to the gills, one to the body.

Character 2: That's incredible. And here I thought having eight arms was their most impressive feature. Do all three hearts beat at the same time or do they alternate somehow?

Character 1: They all work together, but the main heart stops when they swim.

Character 2: Hold on, it stops? The main heart just stops beating while they're swimming? That seems counterintuitive since you'd need more oxygen during physical activity.

Character 1: That's why they prefer crawling to swimming.

Character 2: [trailing off] Oh my god, that makes so much sense now... I always wondered why octopuses seemed to crawl along the ocean floor instead of swimming everywhere.

Character 1: They also have nine brains.

Character 2: Nine?! Okay, now you're just messing with me. Three hearts was already pushing it, but nine brains? How does that even work anatomically?

Character 1: One central brain and one mini-brain in each arm.

Character 2: So each arm can basically think for itself? That's absolutely mind-blowing. No wonder they can open jars and solve puzzles so easily.

Character 1: The arms can react even after being severed.

Character 2: [speaking fast] That's genuinely disturbing but fascinating at the same time like some kind of horror movie creature but it's real and living in our oceans right now.

Character 1: They also have no bones at all.

Character 2: [pause] Right, of course they don't. They can squeeze through any opening larger than their beak. I've seen videos of them escaping through drains on boats.

Character 1: Their beak is the only hard part of their body.

Character 2: A parrot-like beak on a boneless creature with three hearts and nine brains. Evolution really went wild with octopuses. They're basically aliens living on Earth.

Character 1: Some species can also change their skin texture.

Character 2: Not just color but texture too? These creatures are biological shapeshifters. Everything about them sounds like science fiction but it's completely real.
