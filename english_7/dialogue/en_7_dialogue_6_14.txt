=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [sleepily] My cat won't stop screaming at 3am and I haven't slept in weeks.

Character 2: Oh gosh, the midnight serenades! Yeah, cats are, uh, basically tiny opera singers with zero respect for human sleep schedules. Has he always been this, mm, vocally gifted, or is this a new development?

Character 1: He's gotten worse since I started dating someone new.

Character 2: [flirtatious] Ooh, a jealous lover situation! Honestly, cats can be so possessive—I mean, they literally think they own us, which is kind of hot in a weird Stockholm syndrome way, isn't it?

Character 1: Did you just call my cat hot?

Character 2: [very slowly] No no no, I meant the... the dynamic is... erm... psychologically fascinating... from a purely veterinary perspective... of course.

Character 1: He also ate my boyfriend's shoe. Just one shoe.

Character 2: Ha! Classic power move—see, eating just one shoe is, like, deliberate psychological warfare. Both shoes would be hunger, but one? That's a message. Your cat's basically a furry little mob boss.

Character 1: So this is normal?

Character 2: Absolutely.

Character 1: That's it? Just "absolutely"?

Character 2: Sorry, I just—look, I see about three vindictive cats a week, and yours sounds, uh, pretty standard for a romantically threatened feline. They're masters of passive-aggressive revenge, honestly.

Character 1: He also peed in my boyfriend's gym bag.

Character 2: Oof, targeting the gym bag specifically? That's, mm, that's advanced tactics right there. Your cat's running a whole psychological operation—I'm actually kind of impressed by the strategic thinking involved.

Character 1: You're not helping me feel better about this.

Character 2: Oh shoot, sorry, I'm just—cats fascinate me because they're so calculatingly evil sometimes? But hey, the good news is we can definitely work on this with some behavioral modifications.

Character 1: Please tell me that doesn't involve cat therapy.

Character 2: [deep pitch] Well actually, we do offer feline cognitive behavioral therapy sessions now, and before you laugh, our success rate is surprisingly high—about seventy percent of cats show improvement within, er, six weeks.

Character 1: You're joking. You have to be joking.

Character 2: [mocking] Oh sure, because teaching cats emotional regulation is soooo much weirder than them plotting elaborate revenge schemes against your love life, right? But seriously, it actually works—mostly.
