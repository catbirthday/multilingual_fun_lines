=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: That's a first pressing of Pet Sounds you're holding.

Character 2: I know exactly what I'm holding. Mono pressing, 1966, T-2458 on the dead wax. The question is why you're watching me from behind the jazz section for the past ten minutes.

Character 1: [confused] You noticed that?

Character 2: Hard not to notice someone wearing a Velvet Underground shirt incorrectly listing every Nico collaboration under their breath. You got three wrong, by the way. She never worked with Serge Gainsbourg.

Character 1: You could hear that from across the store?

Character 2: Perfect pitch comes with drawbacks. I can hear everything in this place—the fluorescent hum in B-flat, the cash register playing F sharp every transaction, and yes, your nervous muttering about German experimental music.

Character 1: Are you some kind of musician?

Character 2: Was. Session work mostly, until I told Phil Spector his wall of sound was just organized noise. Turns out bruising famous egos doesn't pay rent, so here I am, hunting for records nobody else recognizes.

Character 1: Wait, you worked with Phil Spector?

Character 2: [gasp softly] You're holding my album. Right there, under your left arm—that blue pressing. I played hammond organ on track seven. Haven't seen a copy in fifteen years.

Character 1: This is yours? I found it in the dollar bin.

Character 2: Story of my career right there. We pressed maybe 500 copies before the label went under. The producer overdosed two weeks after we wrapped, and suddenly nobody wanted to touch anything associated with that session.

Character 1: What's it worth?

Character 2: To collectors? Nothing. To me? Everything. That album was supposed to change my life—we recorded it in this haunted church in Louisiana where Robert Johnson supposedly made his deal.

Character 1: Did anything strange happen?

Character 2: The tape machines kept recording after we unplugged them. We got three minutes of music nobody played—still gives me chills. Track eleven if you've got good headphones and an open mind.

Character 1: [angry] You're making this up.

Character 2: [very sincerely] I've got the master tapes in my apartment. Been trying to figure out that phantom track for a decade. Sometimes I think it's just electromagnetic interference, but the melody... it follows rules that shouldn't exist.

Character 1: Show me.

Character 2: [very sad] You'd be the first person who wanted to hear it. Everyone else thought I'd lost it—maybe I did. But if you're serious, bring that album and whatever you know about impossible music.
