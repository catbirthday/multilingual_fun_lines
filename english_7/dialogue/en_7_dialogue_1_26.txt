=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Do you ever think about the things we give up for what we want?

Character 2: Oh man, um, yeah, I mean, I think about that constantly. Like just yesterday I was telling my sister how I missed her birthday dinner because of this work thing, and it's... it's those little sacrifices that kind of add up, you know?

Character 1: [jealous] My sister would never understand if I did that.

Character 2: Right? It's so hard because, I mean, they see it as choosing work over them, but really it's like... I'm sacrificing my time now so we can all have something better later, hopefully. Though admittedly that doesn't always land well in the moment.

Character 1: What was the work thing?

Character 2: Ah, just this huge presentation for a client who, uh, basically demanded we reschedule everything last minute. But here's the thing—if we landed it, it would've meant job security for like twelve people on my team, so... yeah, birthday dinner had to wait.

Character 1: Did you get the client?

Character 2: Mmm, we did actually! But honestly the whole celebration felt a bit hollow because I kept thinking about my sister sitting at that restaurant waiting for me. Sometimes winning doesn't feel like winning when you realize what you, um, what you gave up for it.

Character 1: [child-like] Do you think sacrifice always has to hurt?

Character 2: Ooh, that's... wow, that's actually a really profound question. I guess maybe real sacrifice has to cost something, otherwise it's not really sacrifice, is it? Like when my dad gave up his music career to raise us, that was genuine sacrifice.

Character 1: Your dad was a musician?

Character 2: [formal] Indeed, he was quite accomplished in his youth—toured nationally with a jazz quartet. However, when my mother became ill, he made the decision to pursue more stable employment, and I don't believe he ever truly recovered from that choice.

Character 1: [regretful] I should have asked my parents about their sacrifices.

Character 2: Yeah, it's... it's one of those conversations we always think we'll have later, right? My mom used to say she gave up her PhD to move cities for dad's job, and I never really asked her how that felt until, well, until it was too late.

Character 1: Do you think they resented it?

Character 2: Hmm, sometimes I wonder. Like, my mom would get this look when her old classmates' research got published, sort of wistful and, I don't know, maybe a little bitter? But then she'd look at us kids and say it was worth it, though I'm not entirely sure she meant it every time.

Character 1: That's heavy.

Character 2: [cough] Sorry, yeah, I'm getting all philosophical here. But it's interesting, right? We're all constantly trading one thing for another—time for money, dreams for security, relationships for ambition—and half the time we don't even realize we're doing it.

Character 1: [passionately] But isn't that just life? Making choices?

Character 2: [very loudly] Exactly! That's exactly it! Every choice is a sacrifice because, uh, choosing one path means giving up all the others, and maybe that's not tragic, maybe it's just... human, you know?
