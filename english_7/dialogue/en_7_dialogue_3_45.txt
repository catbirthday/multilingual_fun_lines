=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Did you see what happened with Boeing's PR team after the Alaska Airlines incident?

Character 2: [laugh hysterically] Oh my god, yes, that was an absolute masterclass in how not to handle crisis communications. Their initial response was so tone-deaf that even the Wall Street Journal called them out for it.

Character 1: They waited almost six hours before issuing any statement.

Character 2: [short pause] Six hours in today's media cycle is basically an eternity. By then, Twitter was already ablaze with speculation, CNN had three panels discussing it, and the narrative was completely out of their control.

Character 1: [cough] Sorry, allergies. What about the Wells Fargo situation last month?

Character 2: That was fascinating from a strategic perspective actually. They brought in Ketchum to completely overhaul their messaging, pivoted to transparency-first approach after years of deflection. The New York Times piece on their transformation was pretty compelling.

Character 1: Ketchum's expensive though. We're talking what, seven figures annually?

Character 2: [very excited] Try eight figures for a client like Wells Fargo! But here's the thing—after the fake accounts scandal cost them three billion in settlements, spending twenty million on PR is basically a rounding error.

Character 1: [cry loudly] Twenty million! That's more than our entire marketing budget for five years!

Character 2: [overly polite] Well yes, but perhaps we should consider the scale difference here. Wells Fargo operates in all fifty states with assets exceeding 1.9 trillion dollars, so their communications needs are somewhat more complex than most organizations.

Character 1: Fair point. What's your take on how Meta handled the Cambridge Analytica fallout?

Character 2: [slowly] Meta, or Facebook as it was known then, made every possible mistake. They denied, they deflected, they blamed the media. Zuckerberg's congressional testimony became a meme factory, which is never what you want in crisis management.

Character 1: The apology tour didn't help much either.

Character 2: [cheerful] Actually, the European leg wasn't terrible! The Brussels speech to the European Parliament showed some genuine contrition. Of course, by then the damage was done—GDPR was already in motion, and regulators from London to Berlin were sharpening their knives.

Character 1: [frustrated] Why do tech companies always wait too long to apologize properly?

Character 2: It's the Silicon Valley mentality—move fast, break things, apologize maybe never. Apple's the exception though. Remember when they handled the iPhone battery throttling issue? Tim Cook went on ABC News within forty-eight hours.

Character 1: That's because Apple understands brand equity better than anyone.

Character 2: [bored] Sure, though honestly every company claims they understand brand equity these days. The difference is Apple actually has Edelman on retainer year-round, not just when things explode. Most companies call Burson-Marsteller in a panic at midnight.

Character 1: Speaking of Burson-Marsteller, didn't they merge with someone?

Character 2: They merged with Cohn & Wolfe to form BCW back in 2018. It was supposed to create this PR powerhouse to compete with Edelman and Weber Shandwick, but the integration has been rockier than expected according to PRWeek's latest analysis.
