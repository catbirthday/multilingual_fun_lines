=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're the one who keeps rescue pigeons in your apartment?

Character 2: Yeah, that's me. Started with one injured bird I found outside my building, and now I've got four permanent residents who can't be released. My neighbors probably think I'm running some kind of underground bird sanctuary.

Character 1: Your dating profile just said you "liked animals."

Character 2: I mean, that's technically accurate, right? Though I probably should have mentioned the part where my living room has been converted into basically a pigeon rehabilitation center. The cooing at 5 AM is... it's definitely an acquired taste.

Character 1: Do they have names?

Character 2: Of course they have names. Margaret Thatcher is the bossy one, then there's Beans, Mr. Business, and Kevin. Kevin's the newest—he flew into a window and has this permanent head tilt that makes him look perpetually confused.

Character 1: Margaret Thatcher the pigeon. That's amazing.

Character 2: She rules the roost with an iron wing, I swear. The other birds literally move out of her way when she walks across the floor. It's both hilarious and slightly terrifying.

Character 1: I used to have a pet crow when I was a kid.

Character 2: No way, really? Crows are brilliant. They can actually recognize human faces and hold grudges for years—did yours ever bring you little presents?

Character 1: [whispering loudly] He brought me a wedding ring once. I think he stole it from someone's beach towel.

Character 2: That's incredible. Mine just bring me anxiety and occasional droppings on my work papers. Though Beans did steal my neighbor's spare key once, which led to a very awkward conversation.

Character 1: Do you ever worry what people think when they come over?

Character 2: Oh, constantly. First dates usually end with "this was interesting" which is basically code for "I'm going to tell this story at parties for years." But honestly, if someone can't handle the birds, we probably weren't going to work out anyway.

Character 1: I haven't told you about my snake collection yet.

Character 2: Wait, seriously? Okay, that actually makes me feel way better about the whole bird situation. How many snakes are we talking here?

Character 1: Seven. Different species.

Character 2: [regretful] God, I probably should have asked about pets before suggesting we meet at my place next time. The pigeons are going to absolutely lose their minds if they sense predators nearby.

Character 1: [frustrated] Everyone always assumes they're dangerous. They're in secure terrariums!

Character 2: [overly polite] Oh no, I didn't mean to imply anything negative about your snakes at all. I'm sure they're perfectly lovely creatures who would never dream of eating small birds, and we should definitely keep our respective pets very, very separate.
