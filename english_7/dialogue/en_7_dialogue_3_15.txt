=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [playful] You know what I realized today? We've never actually seen each other eat.

Character 2: [cough] That's... that's not entirely true, is it? We had lunch three weeks ago at that Vietnamese place—wait, no, you ordered takeout. You're right. God, that's strange.

Character 1: Seven months of knowing each other.

Character 2: [cry] I don't like people watching me eat! There, I said it. My therapist says it stems from childhood trauma but honestly I think I just hate the vulnerability of it—the chewing, the swallowing, the possibility of spinach in my teeth.

Character 1: You're crying about eating?

Character 2: No, no—these are relief tears. Do you know how exhausting it is to time every meal around everyone else's schedule? I once ate dinner at 3 AM to avoid my roommate. The microwave beep echoed through the entire building like some kind of midnight confession.

Character 1: That's completely insane.

Character 2: Is it though? Is it really? You cover your laptop camera with tape. Sarah from accounting won't use elevators. Everyone has their thing—mine just happens to involve consuming nutrients in absolute solitude.

Character 1: Sarah's afraid of elevators?

Character 2: Petrified. She walks fourteen flights every morning. Says it's for fitness but I've seen her hyperventilate near the elevator doors. We all pretend not to notice, which is actually quite beautiful in a way—this collective kindness we offer each other.

Character 1: You make dysfunction sound poetic.

Character 2: It's a coping mechanism. If I can find beauty in the chaos, maybe the chaos won't swallow me whole. Like how I've convinced myself that my three alarms set one minute apart are actually a morning symphony rather than evidence of deep-seated anxiety.

Character 1: [very sad] My dad did that. The alarm thing.

Character 2: [sigh] Mine had seventeen coffee cups. Never washed them, just rotated through until they were all dirty, then started the cycle over. I inherited twelve of them. Can't throw them away.

Character 1: Seventeen seems excessive.

Character 2: Everything about my father was excessive. His laugh could shatter windows. His disappointment could freeze entire rooms. But those coffee cups—they were the only things that stayed constant, you know? Reliable in their absurdity.

Character 1: [long pause] Would you eat dinner with me? Tonight?

Character 2: [enunciating every word] I. Would. Rather. Die. But also yes. Yes, absolutely yes. Can we sit in a corner booth where no one can see my face while I navigate pasta?

Character 1: [cough] Deal. No pasta though.

Character 2: Thank God. Soup it is then—nature's most forgiving food group. You can't really fail at soup consumption unless you're using a fork, which would be its own kind of performance art.
