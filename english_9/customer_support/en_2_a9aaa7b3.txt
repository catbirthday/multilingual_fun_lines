=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm probably being really dumb but, um, I got charged forty-seven dollars extra on my card?

Customer Support: Oh no worries at all! Let me—actually wait—let me pull up your account. What's your order number?

Customer: Let me see here... it's, uh, ORD-2947-BK. I think maybe I clicked something wrong?

Customer Support: Got it. Pulling that up now. So I can—hmm—okay I see what happened. You purchased from our UK store. The charge. It's showing £285.00 which converted to $337.47.

Customer: Wait, I sort of thought it was in dollars already? God, I'm so stupid.

Customer Support: No no no! Not stupid. At all. This happens—er—let me check something. The UK site. It doesn't always. Show the conversion clearly.

Customer: Okay so that means... wait, there's another fee too, right? I'm looking at my statement.

Customer Support: Right right. So your bank—they charged—hang on. Yes. $12.50 for the foreign transaction. On top of the conversion. I'm gonna make sure. We get you a credit for that.

Customer: Oh you don't have to, I mean, this is probably my fault for not reading properly.

Customer Support: Stop that! Not your fault. Look I'm—actually no—I'm applying. Store credit. Code CRD-9847-X. Worth $15.00. To cover that bank fee.

Customer: Hmm, but what if I order internationally again? Like, maybe I should just learn how this works?

Customer Support: Smart thinking. So here's—okay—here's what I'll do. Setting up. An alert. On your account. Profile code INT-ALERT-7. Anytime you're on a foreign site. Big warning. Shows exact USD conversion.

Customer: That's really nice but, er, I feel bad taking credits when I probably should've known better.

Customer Support: Listen. The system—it should be—look it's not clear enough. That's on us. Your new total. After credit. It's $334.97. Already processed.

Customer: Okay so wait, let me think... if the original was three thirty-seven, then... oh God, there's tax too isn't there?

Customer Support: No no. International orders. No additional tax. The £285.00. That included. UK VAT already. Twenty percent. Built in.

Customer: Jesus, twenty percent? Erhm, sorry, now I'm worried about my other order from Germany.

Customer Support: Let me—hold on—checking your history. I see it. Order GMY-4429-Q. That one. Already shipped. Total was €189.00. Converted to $206.71. No surprises there.

Customer: Oh thank God. Okay so basically just, um, always check the currency symbol, right?

Customer Support: Exactly. But also. The alert I set up. It'll catch it. Every time. Promise. You're protected now.
