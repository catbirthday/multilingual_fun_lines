=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So my account got hacked and I can't get in and I keep trying the password reset but nothing's working and I'm worried they're buying stuff or I don't know changing everything and what if they...

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Oh no. That's awful. Look. I get it. Someone violated your space. Let me pull up account recovery tools right now. Need your email first.

Customer: It's supposed to be linked to my email but when I try to—no wait actually—they must have changed that too because the reset emails aren't even coming through anymore are you sure you can fix this?

Customer Support: *exhales* Okay. Yes. Absolutely can fix this. Your account ID shows as ACC-4492-BX here. Last verified login was Tuesday October 24th at 3:47 PM. That you?

Customer: No no no that wasn't me I was at work then I haven't logged in since like Sunday and now you're telling me someone's been in there for days?

Customer Support: I know. Terrifying. Listen. Security team flagged unusual activity from an IP in Romania. Started October 24th. But here's good news. Nothing purchased. Nothing deleted.

Customer: Okay but are you absolutely sure because I had years of photos and documents in there and if those are gone I just—I mean what happens to all my...

Customer Support: *soft exhale* Everything's intact. Promise. Looking at file access logs now. Zero deletions. They tried changing your recovery email to something ending in @yopmail. We blocked it. System caught it.

Customer: Wait so the system caught it but nobody told me? Of course. Of course that's how it works. Why would anyone actually notify me that my account was...

Customer Support: You're right. That's on us. Notification should've gone out immediately. Code NTF-881 shows it got stuck in queue. Honestly? Our alert system needs work. Everyone knows it.

Customer: So what now because I still can't get in and I need this fixed today not like next week or whenever someone decides to...

Customer Support: Right now. Fixing it right now. *sharp inhale* Between you and me? Bypassing normal 48-hour verification wait. Sending recovery link to your phone. Number ending in 7739?

Customer: Yes yes that's me but wait—actually no—are you sure that's safe because what if they can intercept that too or...

Customer Support: Good question. Using encrypted channel ENC-TLS-256. They can't touch it. Link expires in 10 minutes. One-time use only. Military-grade protection. You're safe.

Customer: Okay I'm checking my phone and nothing yet and it's been like thirty seconds already should I be worried or...

Customer Support: Takes 45 seconds. Always does. System processes through server farm in Building 4. There. Just went through. Check now. Should say "Urgent Security Reset."

Customer: I got it I got it okay I'm clicking and—wait it wants a verification code now where do I even...

Customer Support: *exhale* That's me. I'm generating it. Ready? Victor-Seven-Seven-Nine-Kilo-Mike. All caps. No spaces. System requires manual override approval. Technically bending protocol here.

Customer: It worked oh my god it actually worked I'm in I'm changing the password right now but um what stops them from just doing this again?

Customer Support: Smart thinking. Already enabled advanced protection on your account. Protocol SEC-PLUS-400. Two-factor mandatory now. Recovery requires video verification. Nobody's getting back in. You're locked down tight.
