=== Dialogue ===

Customer: *exhales* I need to speak with someone about your Riverside location. This is completely unacceptable.

Customer Support: Oh okay yes absolutely I can help you with that let me just pull up the location details here for Riverside that's store number ST-4829-RV and I'll document everything um what happened there today was there a specific incident or...

Customer: Do you know how long I waited? *sharp breath* Forty-five minutes. For a pickup order.

Customer Support: Oh wow forty-five minutes that's definitely not right at all let me look at your account here and document this properly so what's your order number or phone number so I can pull up the transaction ID and see exactly what happened because that wait time is way outside our service standards I mean we aim for under five minutes for pickups so...

Customer: *sighs heavily* My husband is on your executive board. Thomas Chen. Perhaps you've heard of him?

Customer Support: Oh gosh okay let me make sure I'm documenting this correctly then so that's Thomas Chen and you were at Riverside location ST-4829-RV and the incident code I'm generating is INC-77290-EXEC and I'm escalating this right away um can you tell me more about what specifically went wrong because I want to make sure we capture everything if that makes sense...

Customer: The staff just... *exhales* stood there. Chatting. While I waited.

Customer Support: That's really concerning behavior code VIO-892 for staff negligence and I'm adding that to your incident report right now and actually let me check the shift roster real quick to see who was working RST-SHIFT-0923 shows manager Bradley K was on duty so this is definitely something that needs immediate attention and I'm wondering if there were other issues or just mainly the wait time and staff behavior...

Customer: Hmm. Well. *breath* You seem to actually be taking this seriously.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely yes!

Customer: *softer exhale* I suppose... maybe an apology credit would help. If that's possible.

Customer Support: Actually yes I can definitely do that right away so I'm applying compensation code COMP-5577-XM to your account which is a fifty dollar credit and er also I'm seeing here that you're a platinum member ID PLT-888290 so I should probably bump that up to seventy-five and honestly with the executive connection I think my supervisor would want me to make sure you're completely satisfied so...

Customer: *small breath* Seventy-five? Well. That's... surprisingly reasonable.

Customer Support: Yeah and actually wait let me check something else here because with incident INC-77290-EXEC tagged as executive escalation I might be able to do even more hang on I'm looking through our compensation matrix and hmm there's a special override code I can use OVR-EXEC-100 that would give you a hundred dollar credit instead would that work better for you because I really want to make this right...

Customer: *inhale* A hundred dollars. Alright. Yes, that would be acceptable.

Customer Support: Perfect perfect applying that right now!

Customer: And you'll... *breath* speak to that manager? Bradley, was it?

Customer Support: Oh definitely yes the incident report INC-77290-EXEC goes straight to regional management and er actually since you mentioned Mr. Chen I'm adding a priority flag PRI-001-BOARD which means Bradley's district manager will see this within the hour and they'll have to respond with corrective action plan CAP-4829 within twenty-four hours so this won't just disappear if that's what you're worried about I mean we take these things really seriously...

Customer: *relieved exhale* Good. Thank you. This has been... surprisingly helpful.

Customer Support: Aw I'm so glad I could help and just to confirm everything the hundred dollar credit with code COMP-EXEC-100 will show up within two to three business days on your account and the incident report is filed and escalated and um is there anything else I can help you with today or any other concerns about that location or...
