Customer: So I'm on lunch. Got maybe ten minutes. Order's not here yet?

Customer Support: Oh okay. Quick check then. Um... account number? Or order? Either works. Let me just—system's being slow today.

Customer: It's—wait no, that's Tuesday. Wednesday? I think Wednesday delivery.

Customer Support: Right right. Wednesday. Hmm, let me see what's... okay so order WED-4472-BC shows delivered. Yesterday actually. At 3:47 PM.

Customer: No that's—I mean Monday. Sorry. Brain's not working.

Customer Support: No worries! Monday then. Er... nothing Monday though. Could it be—what's the word—scheduled? For later? Like upcoming?

Customer: I probably wrote it down wrong. Always do this kind of thing.

Customer Support: Hey no. Don't worry. Look we're gonna—actually wait. Found something. Order MON-8891-XJ. Processing since March 14th. That's... huh. Three weeks?

Customer: Three weeks? So basically it's just... stuck?

Customer Support: Yeah that's. Not right. At all. Okay so—no actually—let me escalate. Status code shows ERR-091. Never seen that before.

Customer: Oh good. Yeah. Sorry for all the confusion and like... yeah.

Customer Support: Please! Nothing to apologize for. System failed you. Completely. Reference number APL-7792-SS if anything goes wrong. Which it won't.
