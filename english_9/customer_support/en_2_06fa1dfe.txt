Scenario: wanting to update their shipping address for an order already in transit

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I need to update the shipping address for order number 8847-TK. It shipped yesterday to the wrong location.

Customer Support: I understand the urgency of this situation. Let me pull up order 8847-TK right away and check the current status of your shipment to see what options we have available.

Customer: The package is going to my old office. I need it redirected to my home address immediately.

Customer Support: I can see your package left our distribution center at 6:47 AM this morning and is currently with carrier facility CF-294 in transit to the original destination.

Customer: What are my options for intercepting it? This contains critical documents I need by Friday.

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: Can you initiate a delivery intercept right now? I have my new address ready to provide.

Customer Support: I'm initiating the intercept request immediately through our priority system. Please provide your new delivery address, and I'll need to verify it matches the billing address on account 4492-BK7 for security purposes.

Customer: The new address is 4821 Riverside Drive, Suite 200, Portland, Oregon, 97205.

Customer Support: Thank you, I've entered 4821 Riverside Drive, Suite 200, Portland, Oregon 97205 into our system, and the intercept request has been submitted with reference number INT-3847-M92.

Customer: When will I know if the intercept was successful? I need confirmation before end of business today.

Customer Support: You'll receive an email confirmation within 2 hours to your registered address, and I'm also scheduling a courtesy callback for 3:30 PM Pacific Time to confirm the intercept status directly.

Customer: Good. What happens if the intercept fails and it delivers to the wrong address?

Customer Support: If the intercept fails, our recovery team will immediately dispatch a courier to retrieve the package from the original address within 24 hours, and we'll overnight it to your Portland location at no additional charge.

Customer: I need written documentation of this service guarantee. Can you send that with the confirmation?

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: Also, please update my default shipping address in your system to prevent this happening again.

Customer Support: I've updated your default shipping address to the Portland location effective immediately, and this change is reflected across all active subscriptions under account 4492-BK7 as of 11:42 AM today.

Customer: Perfect. Please confirm the total timeframe for delivery to the new address if the intercept succeeds.

Customer Support: With a successful intercept, your package will arrive at 4821 Riverside Drive by Thursday at 5:00 PM, which is one business day later than the original Wednesday delivery to accommodate the rerouting through facility HUB-7X.
