=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Good afternoon. I need to discuss an unauthorized rate increase on my account that appeared on this month's bill.

Customer Support: Good afternoon, and thank you for calling. I'll be happy to review your account and investigate this rate change. May I please have your account number to get started?

Customer: It's 4829-7761-0043. This needs to be resolved today as I'm processing quarterly budgets.

Customer Support: Thank you. I have your account 4829-7761-0043 pulled up now, showing you've been with us since March 2021. I can see there was a rate adjustment on your October 15th billing cycle.

Customer: I never received any notification about this increase. My contract specifies thirty days advance notice.

Customer Support: I understand your concern, and you're absolutely right about the notification requirement. Let me check your notification history in our system CRM-7742 to see what correspondence was sent and when.

Customer: Please do. This is a twenty-eight percent increase, which significantly impacts our operating costs.

Customer Support: I see the issue now. Our system shows a notification was queued for dispatch on September 14th with reference number NTF-89234-QR, but there's a delivery failure flag on your account's email settings.

Customer: That's concerning. We haven't changed our contact information and receive all other correspondence without issue.

Customer Support: You're correct to be concerned. I can see all your invoices and service updates have been successfully delivered to the email address ending in -corp.com, but this specific rate notification encountered an error code E-7749.

Customer: What does that mean exactly, and more importantly, how do we fix this situation?

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: I need this rate reversed until proper notice is given. When can that be processed?

Customer Support: I completely understand, and given the notification failure on our end, that's a reasonable request. I'm escalating this to our billing adjustment team under case number ADJ-5521-KMP for expedited review within two business days.

Customer: Two business days is acceptable. Will the rate be reversed retroactively to October fifteenth?

Customer Support: Yes, I'm adding that specific request to your case. The adjustment will backdate to October 15th, crediting the difference of $347.82 to your account once approved by the billing team.

Customer: Perfect. Please send me written confirmation of this case and the expected resolution timeline.

Customer Support: Of course.

Customer: Thank you for handling this efficiently. I'll watch for that confirmation and the case updates.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. I've documented everything in case ADJ-5521-KMP and added priority status due to the notification error. You'll receive the confirmation within the hour, and I'll personally monitor this to ensure it's resolved properly.
