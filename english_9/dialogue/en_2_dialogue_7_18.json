And honestly, a 50-point drop isn't necessarily a deal-breaker—it really depends on where you started from and, uh, what actually caused the drop in the first place."

So one missed payment, that's actually... well, it's not ideal, obviously, but it's way better than multiple missed payments or, like, a default or something. Most lenders are gonna want to see at least three months of on-time payments after that, which, hey, sounds like you're already there, right?"

But look, there are ways we can potentially offset that—like if you've got significant equity in the home or, uh, if you're willing to buy points upfront."

But here's the thing—if your home's value has gone up since you bought it, we could potentially order a new appraisal and, um, maybe squeeze out a bit more equity that way?"

            "content": "Gosh, it really varies, but typically you're looking at, errr, somewhere between half a percent to one percent of your loan amount annually? So like, on a $300,000 loan, that's maybe $125 to $250 per month, which I know sounds like a lot, but it automatically drops off once you hit that 20% equity mark."

            "content": "Yeah, I get it, it's... it's frustrating. But wait, let me actually pull up some alternative programs here because, um, there might be some lender-paid PMI options where they basically bake it into a slightly higher rate instead of a separate monthly payment, which some people find easier to swallow."

            "content": "Oh. Ohhhh, okay, that's... well, that complicates things a bit because if they're on the mortgage too, we're gonna need both credit reports for the refi application. And, uh, honestly? These things have a way of coming out during the process anyway, so maybe it's better to have that conversation sooner rather than later?"

And even if we could remove them—which, yikes, that's a whole other process—we'd only be able to use your income for qualification, which might really limit what you can borrow."

You've got three paths: wait another few months for your credit to recover a bit more, which, mmm, might get you better terms; apply now and just accept the higher rate; or—and this is probably the smartest move—let me shop around with multiple lenders because some are way more forgiving about isolated credit hiccups than others."
