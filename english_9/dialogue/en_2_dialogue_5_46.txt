Character 1: What's your take on the proposed 25% medical equipment tariffs?

Character 2: Ah, that's... that's going to hit us hard actually. Most of our adaptive equipment comes from overseas manufacturers, and, um, Medicare reimbursement rates won't adjust to match those increased costs.

Character 1: How much are we talking per device?

Character 2: [speeding up] Well, a basic powered wheelchair runs about $15,000 currently, so we're looking at, hmm, $3,750 increase just from the tariff, and that's before markup adjustments from distributors.

Character 1: That seems unsustainable.

Character 2: Absolutely. I mean, our clinic already struggles with the 80/20 Medicare split, and now we're essentially asking patients to cover an additional, uh, let's see... probably $4,500 out-of-pocket after everything.

Character 1: [laugh hard] And I thought healthcare costs couldn't get worse!

Character 2: Right? The irony is, um, domestic production for specialized OT equipment is basically nonexistent. We don't manufacture FES units or dynamic orthoses here anymore.

Character 1: What about basic items like therapy putty or resistance bands?

Character 2: Okay, so those are mostly from China and Taiwan. Even TheraBand, which sounds American, sources production overseas now. We're talking cents becoming dollars on high-volume consumables.

Character 1: Any workarounds you're considering?

Character 2: [furious] Honestly? We're having to ration equipment already! Like, we're literally telling stroke patients they might need to wait three months for proper positioning devices because insurance won't cover the new pricing!

Character 1: Three months post-stroke is critical time lost.

Character 2: Exactly. Neuroplasticity peaks in those first 90 days. Without proper adaptive equipment, we're, um, essentially sacrificing functional outcomes for cost management, which goes against everything we're trained for.

Character 1: Are other clinics facing similar issues?

Character 2: Mmm, yeah. The AOTA sent out guidelines suggesting we explore, uh, "creative billing solutions," which is basically code for fragmenting services to maximize reimbursement potential.

Character 1: That sounds legally questionable.

Character 2: Oh, it's a gray area for sure. We're talking about unbundling therapy codes, like billing 97530 and 97110 separately when they're really, um, part of the same intervention session.

Character 1: What's the long-term impact on your profession?

Character 2: [slowly] Well... I think we're going to see a lot of OTs leaving hospital settings for cash-pay private practice. The math just, mmm, doesn't work anymore when equipment costs exceed reimbursement caps by 40%.
