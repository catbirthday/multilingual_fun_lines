=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: How many games are you covering this week?

Character 2: Three basketball games, two hockey matches, and that big boxing event on Saturday. The schedule's getting brutal with playoffs approaching—I'm basically living at arenas and press boxes these days.

Character 1: Still doing those morning recap articles?

Character 2: Every single day at 6 AM sharp. I write up last night's scores, pull the best quotes from post-game interviews, analyze any major upsets. The editor wants them posted before people check their phones over breakfast.

Character 1: [gasp loudly] You're up at what time then?

Character 2: 4:30 AM usually. I need time to review game footage, check injury reports, scan social media for any breaking news. Sports journalism means your sleep schedule basically doesn't exist during the season.

Character 1: Do you ever just make up quotes?

Character 2: Never. That's career suicide in this business. Every quote gets verified through recordings, every stat gets double-checked against official records. One fabrication and your credibility is gone forever.

Character 1: What about those unnamed sources everyone uses?

Character 2: Those are real people with real information who can't go on record. Usually it's front office staff, assistant coaches, sometimes players' agents. You need at least two sources to confirm anything before you can run with it.

Character 1: Remember that scandal with the quarterback last month?

Character 2: [very sad] That story destroyed three careers. The reporter who broke it, the editor who approved it, and obviously the quarterback himself. Turns out half the evidence was doctored and nobody caught it until after publication.

Character 1: How do you verify something like that?

Character 2: You cross-reference everything. Check timestamps on photos, verify locations through multiple witnesses, get documents authenticated by experts. It takes days sometimes, but that's the job—being right matters more than being first.

Character 1: But everyone wants to be first now.

Character 2: Twitter changed everything. Now some kid with a phone can break news before established journalists even know something happened. We're competing with millions of amateur reporters who don't follow any ethical guidelines.

Character 1: Is that why you're considering switching to features?

Character 2: Feature writing lets you dig deeper. Instead of racing to report scores, you're spending weeks profiling an athlete, understanding their journey. You get to tell actual stories instead of just reciting statistics and play-by-plays.

Character 1: You'd miss the adrenaline though.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Maybe. There's nothing like being courtside when a championship gets decided. That energy, that moment when history happens right in front of you—feature writing can't replicate that feeling.
