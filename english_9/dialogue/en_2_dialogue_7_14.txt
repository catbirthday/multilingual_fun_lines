=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So we're really doing this? Jumping off a perfectly good bridge?

Character 2: Oh absolutely! I mean, technically it's not perfectly good—there's actually a crack in the, uh, third support beam, but that's probably fine. The company has a solid four-star rating on Yelp, which is basically like having a safety certification, right?

Character 1: Four stars? What happened to the fifth star?

Character 2: Well, um, apparently someone's cord was three feet too long, but hey, they gave him a full refund! Plus free physical therapy vouchers, which is honestly pretty generous when you think about it.

Character 1: [stuttering] W-w-wait, are you s-serious right now?

Character 2: Kidding! Totally kidding. Though actually, fun fact—bungee jumping is statistically safer than, uh, driving to the bungee jumping site. So technically we already survived the dangerous part!

Character 1: That's not as reassuring as you think it is.

Character 2: Look, worst case scenario, we become viral videos, and isn't that kind of immortality? "Local idiots forget to attach cord"—boom, fifteen million views, we're legends forever.

Character 1: Oh god, is my cord actually attached?

Character 2: [stuttering] Y-yeah, definitely! Well, I mean, it l-looks attached from here. That clippy thing is doing something, and there's definitely a rope involved, so we're basically golden.

Character 1: [excited] This is insane! I can't believe we're actually doing this!

Character 2: Right? Nothing says "I'm a functioning adult" quite like voluntarily falling off a bridge! My therapist is gonna have a field day with this one, assuming I, you know, make it to next week's session.

Character 1: Your therapist told you to do this?

Character 2: Well, she said I should "take more leaps" in life, so technically I'm just being really, really literal about following medical advice. That's responsible behavior if you ask me.

Character 1: The instructor is giving us the countdown. Oh no.

Character 2: [enunciating every word] Remember to keep your arms out, bend your knees, and absolutely do not think about that documentary where the cord snapped. Oops, sorry, shouldn't have mentioned that.

Character 1: Why would you say that NOW?

Character 2: Because, um, nervous talking is my superpower! Also, fun fact number two—screaming actually makes the experience better because it, uh, releases endorphins or something equally scientific-sounding.

Character 1: Three... two... one... JUMPING!

Character 2: [very loudly] THIS WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA BUT AT LEAST WE'RE TERRIBLE TOGETHER! Also I maybe should've mentioned I'm afraid of heights!
