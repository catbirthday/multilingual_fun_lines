Character 1: Is it normal to hate your job this much?

Character 2: Oh man, um... yeah, I mean, honestly? More people hate their jobs than you'd think. Like, there's this whole thing where we pretend everything's fine at work but, uh, most of us are just grinding through it.

Character 1: [mocking] "Follow your passion" they said.

Character 2: Right? God, that advice is so... I don't know, it's kind of cruel when you think about it. Most passions don't pay rent, and the ones that do often turn into, um, just another grind once they become obligations.

Character 1: So what, we're all just doomed to misery?

Character 2: No no, it's not—okay, hear me out. I think the trick is finding work that's, like, tolerable enough that it doesn't crush your soul while you pursue what actually matters outside of it, you know?

Character 1: That sounds depressing as hell.

Character 2: Mmm, maybe, but it's also kind of liberating? Like once you stop expecting your job to be this, uh, grand fulfilling thing, you can just... let it be a job and find meaning elsewhere.

Character 1: My boss makes me want to scream daily.

Character 2: [loudly] Oh GOD, bad bosses are literally the worst part! I had this manager once who would, um, micromanage my emails—EMAILS!—and I swear it took years off my life.

Character 1: Mine asks me to "circle back" on everything.

Character 2: Ugh, corporate speak is its own special hell. "Let's take this offline," "synergy," "bandwidth"—it's like, can we just... talk like humans? The jargon makes everything feel so, I don't know, soulless.

Character 1: I fantasize about quitting dramatically.

Character 2: Oh man, we all do! I used to imagine this whole scene where I'd, like, tell everyone exactly what I thought and just walk out, but honestly? The quiet two weeks' notice is usually the smarter play.

Character 1: Even if they deserve worse?

Character 2: Especially then, actually. The thing is, um, references matter, and burning bridges feels great for like five minutes but then you're stuck explaining it in interviews for years, which is... yeah, not worth it.

Character 1: [chuckle] You sound like you've thought about this a lot.

Character 2: Ha, yeah, I mean... I've been through the whole work existential crisis thing more times than I'd like to admit. Eventually you realize that, uh, most jobs are just trading time for money and that's... okay, actually.

Character 1: That's the most depressing pep talk ever.

Character 2: Maybe, but here's the thing—once you accept that work is just work, you can actually start building a life you like around it. The job doesn't have to be everything, it just has to, you know, pay for everything else that matters.
