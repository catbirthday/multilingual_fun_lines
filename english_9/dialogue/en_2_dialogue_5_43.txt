Character 1: I think I might have executive dysfunction or whatever it's called.

Character 2: Oh yeah, that's, um, basically when your brain's manager is on permanent coffee break. Like, you know what you need to do but actually doing it feels impossible, which honestly describes most people I know.

Character 1: Is that even a real thing though?

Character 2: Mm, totally real. Your brain has this, uh, CEO part that's supposed to organize everything, but sometimes it just... doesn't. Kind of like having all the ingredients for dinner but, you know, somehow ordering pizza instead.

Character 1: Huh. So why can't I just make myself do stuff?

Character 2: Well, it's not really about willpower, I mean, your brain literally processes the "just do it" signal differently. It's actually kind of like trying to drive a car when the, um, steering wheel isn't properly connected to the wheels.

Character 1: That sounds broken.

Character 2: Nah, not broken, just... wired differently. Some people's brains are Ferraris for certain things and, uh, tricycles for others. The trick is figuring out what your brain likes and kind of, you know, working with that instead of against it.

Character 1: But I can't even start basic tasks.

Character 2: Right, so, starting is actually the hardest part because your brain needs this huge activation energy, like, way more than other people need. Once you're rolling though, it's usually fine, which is why, hmm, breaking things into stupidly small steps sometimes works.

Character 1: Stupidly small?

Character 2: Yeah like, instead of "clean room," you just commit to picking up one sock. Sounds dumb but it, er, tricks your brain into starting, and then momentum kind of takes over sometimes.

Character 1: One sock. That's your advice.

Character 2: Look, I know it sounds ridiculous, but executive function is basically your brain being really bad at, um, estimating effort. So if you make the task small enough that your brain goes "whatever, that's nothing," you can sneak past the, uh, resistance point.

Character 1: What if I just pick up the sock and then stop?

Character 2: Honestly? That's still a win. You did the thing you said you'd do, which, mmm, builds trust with yourself. Plus, half the time you'll keep going anyway because, well, you're already there and the hard part was actually just standing up.

Character 1: This feels like I'm treating myself like a toddler.

Character 2: Hah, yeah, kind of. But your executive function is literally, like, the toddler part of your brain throwing tantrums about doing stuff. So you've got to be sneaky and, you know, work with what you've got rather than feeling bad about it.

Character 1: Is this why I can play video games for six hours but can't answer one email?

Character 2: Exactly! Games give constant little rewards and, uh, clear objectives, while emails are vague and boring with no immediate payoff. Your brain's basically optimized for hunting mammoths, not spreadsheets, so anything that feels like hunting gets priority.
