=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: How do you handle late submissions these days?

Character 2: Oh, that's... huh, that's actually evolved so much for me over the years. I used to be really rigid about it, you know, automatic ten percent off per day, but now I'm more like, what's really going on with this kid?

Character 1: [very slowly] Do you think we're getting too soft?

Character 2: Mmm, I don't think it's about being soft, exactly. It's more... well, I guess I've started seeing grades as this ongoing conversation rather than, um, these fixed judgments we hand down from on high.

Character 1: When did that shift happen for you?

Character 2: [clearing throat] So there was this student, maybe five years ago, brilliant writer but constantly late with everything. And I realized I was punishing her for struggling with executive function, not for, like, lacking understanding of the material, which felt... I don't know, kind of wrong?

Character 1: But doesn't that create inconsistency?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, yeah, it creates all sorts of inconsistencies. But honestly? Perfect consistency was already an illusion—I mean, my mood on Tuesday versus Friday affects how I grade essays, let's be real here.

Character 1: How do you explain that to parents?

Character 2: Oof, that's the hard part. Usually I frame it as, er, holistic assessment focused on growth, which sounds very educational and professional but really means I'm basically making judgement calls based on thirty years of gut instinct.

Character 1: What about the kids who turn everything in on time?

Character 2: [regretful] Yeah, I... I actually worry about them sometimes more than the late ones. Like, some of them are so terrified of disappointing anyone that they're literally making themselves sick over getting that A, and I'm part of that system.

Character 1: Do you ever just want to throw out grades entirely?

Character 2: Every single semester, without fail. There's this moment, usually around week ten, where I'm drowning in papers and I think, what if we just... didn't? What if we actually just focused on learning?

Character 1: But then reality sets in.

Character 2: Exactly. Reality being transcripts and college applications and, well, the entire educational infrastructure that would basically collapse if we stopped quantifying everything.

Character 1: Do you think we'll look back on this system as barbaric?

Character 2: Hmm, probably? I mean, reducing a kid's entire intellectual journey to a letter feels pretty crude when you really think about it. But then again, we need some kind of shorthand, I suppose.

Character 1: What's your favorite part of grading?

Character 2: Oh gosh, um, it's those moments when you can literally see the thinking happen on the page. When a student surprises themselves with an insight they didn't know they had—that's when all the red pen corrections and, er, rubric boxes just fade away and you remember why we do this.
