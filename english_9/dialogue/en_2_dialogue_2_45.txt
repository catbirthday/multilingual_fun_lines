=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [very sincerely] I just finished working with Colleen Atwood on a period piece. You know, the woman who did Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha.

Character 2: [gasp softly] Colleen Atwood? She's won four Academy Awards for costume design. What was it like working with someone who dressed Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands and Alice in Wonderland?

Character 1: [playful] Oh, we're practically best friends now. She said my eye for Victorian corsetry reminded her of Sandy Powell's work on The Favourite.

Character 2: [very excited] Sandy Powell is incredible too—she's got three Oscars herself! Did you know she designed both Shakespeare in Love and The Aviator? Her range from Elizabethan ruffs to 1940s Hollywood glamour is absolutely stunning.

Character 1: Well, I've actually been consulting for the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute. Anna Wintour personally requested my input.

Character 2: [whispering] The Met Gala's Anna Wintour? That's the most prestigious costume collection in America. They have pieces from Charles James, Balenciaga, and original Dior New Look suits from 1947.

Character 1: [cheerful] Speaking of Dior, I own three vintage pieces from his Tulip line. Found them at an estate sale in the Hamptons last summer.

Character 2: Original Christian Dior from the 1953 collection would be worth a fortune. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London just paid two million pounds for a single Bar Suit from his debut collection.

Character 1: My mentor was Edith Head, you know. Well, I studied under someone who worked with her at Paramount.

Character 2: Edith Head designed for Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday and Grace Kelly in Rear Window. She won eight Oscars, more than any other costume designer in history.

Character 1: I've been commissioned to recreate Elizabeth I's coronation robes for the Globe Theatre's upcoming production.

Character 2: The original robes are at Westminster Abbey, made with cloth-of-gold and ermine. Janet Arnold spent decades documenting Tudor clothing construction methods—her patterns are the bible for historical accuracy.

Character 1: Janet Arnold? Yes, I have all her books. First editions, signed.

Character 2: Those Pattern of Fashion books are incredibly rare, especially signed copies. Most costume designers reference the Dover reprints or the newer editions from Macmillan.

Character 1: [animated] I'm actually flying to Florence next week to examine the Medici wedding gowns at Palazzo Pitti.

Character 2: The Galleria del Costume has Eleanor of Toledo's burial dress from 1562, the one Bronzino painted her wearing. That brocade pattern has been studied by everyone from Milena Canonero to Jacqueline Durran.

Character 1: Jacqueline Durran asked for my opinion on her Anna Karenina costumes, actually.

Character 2: She won the Oscar for that film's costume design, beating out Eiko Ishioka's posthumous nomination for Mirror Mirror. Durran's ability to blend 1870s Russian aristocratic fashion with modern sensibilities was revolutionary.

Character 1: Revolutionary is exactly how people describe my work. I'm basically the next Adrian or Travis Banton.

Character 2: [cough] Adrian designed for Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford at MGM's golden age, while Banton created Marlene Dietrich's iconic looks at Paramount. Those are some legendary shoes to fill, but the industry always needs fresh visionaries.
