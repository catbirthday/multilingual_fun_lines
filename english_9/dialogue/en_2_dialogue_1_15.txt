=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You actually think you deserve this promotion.

Character 2: Deserve is such a pedestrian concept. I've restructured three departments in six months, each one now operating at thirty percent above projected efficiency. The numbers speak louder than your feelings about fairness.

Character 1: Those were my proposals. My restructuring plans.

Character 2: Your drafts, certainly. But drafts are just theory until someone with actual execution capability transforms them into reality. I took your academic exercises and made them profitable—that's the difference between us.

Character 1: You can't just... steal credit like that.

Character 2: Steal implies ownership, which implies you had the capability to implement them yourself. You didn't. You sat in meetings drawing diagrams while I convinced the board to invest four million dollars.

Character 1: Because I gave you everything! The data, the projections—

Character 2: [jealous] Oh, here we go again with the martyrdom. Poor brilliant mind, trapped behind a desk while lesser mortals take action. You know what your problem is? You think intelligence alone deserves reward.

Character 1: [very meekly] I thought we were partners...

Character 2: Partners share risk. You risked nothing—no reputation, no capital, no relationships. I put my name on every document while you stayed safely anonymous, ready to distance yourself if things went wrong.

Character 1: That's not what happened.

Character 2: Isn't it? When Morrison questioned the Asia-Pacific expansion, where were you? I stood in that boardroom for three hours defending your numbers while you sent apologetic emails from the safety of your cubicle.

Character 1: You told me not to come!

Character 2: I told you the stakes were high. You chose to interpret that as permission to hide. See, this is what I mean—you want credit without confrontation, success without sacrifice.

Character 1: You're rewriting history.

Character 2: [happy] History belongs to whoever tells it best! And tomorrow, when I'm running the European division, I'll tell it beautifully. Your contributions will be footnoted, naturally. Academic advisor—it has a nice ring.

Character 1: They'll see through you eventually.

Character 2: Will they? Because from where I'm standing, they see someone who delivers results. You see manipulation; they see leadership. You see theft; they see resourcefulness.

Character 1: This isn't over.

Character 2: Of course it isn't. I'll need fresh ideas for next quarter, and you'll provide them, wrapped in resentment and righteous indignation. It's actually quite a perfect arrangement when you think about it.
