Sometimes reviewers say \"cut\" when they really mean \"reshape\" or \"relocate,\" you know? I've learned to always preserve my original drafts because, honestly, half the time you end up needing pieces of them later."

And I swear, like seventy percent of that stuff finds its way back into either the same paper or, you know, becomes the seed for something else entirely."

But listen, preserving your work isn't about being stubborn, it's about recognizing that, mmm, sometimes good ideas just need different contexts."

            "content": "Mmm, yeah, when there's consensus it's usually worth paying attention. But even then, I'd say preserve everything first, then make your cuts.

Just remember that preserving it doesn't mean being precious about it - it means giving yourself options, and honestly, future you will thank present you for keeping everything."
