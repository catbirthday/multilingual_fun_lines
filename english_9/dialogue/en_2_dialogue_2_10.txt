Character 1: What's your take on multitasking?

Character 2: It's a myth. Your brain can't actually do two cognitive tasks simultaneously. You're just rapidly switching between them and doing both worse.

Character 1: [frustrated] But I get so much done when I multitask!

Character 2: No, you don't. Studies prove you're 40% less efficient. You just feel productive because you're busy. There's a difference.

Character 1: What about listening to music while working?

Character 2: [speaking fast] That's different—music uses different brain regions than analytical work. But if it has lyrics and you're writing, you're sabotaging yourself. Instrumental only for cognitive tasks.

Character 1: [over confidently] I definitely work better with my playlist on. Always have.

Character 2: You work better than in silence, maybe. But you'd work even better with white noise or nature sounds. Your playlist is emotional comfort, not cognitive enhancement.

Character 1: How can you be so sure?

Character 2: [high-pitched] Because we've studied this for decades! Stanford, MIT, every major research institution agrees. Multitasking is literally making us dumber as a society.

Character 1: That seems extreme.

Character 2: It's not. IQ scores are dropping for the first time in history. Attention spans are measurably shorter. We've trained ourselves to never focus deeply on anything.

Character 1: Maybe we're just adapting to process information differently?

Character 2: That's wishful thinking. The brain's architecture hasn't changed. We're not evolving; we're just getting worse at thinking.

Character 1: So what's the solution?

Character 2: Single-tasking. Time-blocking. Turn off notifications. Most people can't even read for twenty minutes without checking their phone anymore. That's not adaptation; it's deterioration.

Character 1: [high-pitched] Twenty minutes? That's nothing!

Character 2: Try it. Set a timer, pick up a book, and see if you can resist every urge to grab your phone. Most people fail within five minutes.

Character 1: That's depressing.

Character 2: It's reality. But here's the thing—you can retrain your brain. Takes about three weeks of deliberate practice. Most people just won't do the work because discomfort feels like danger to our dopamine-addicted minds.
