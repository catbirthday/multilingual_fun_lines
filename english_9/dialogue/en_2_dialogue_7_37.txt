=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So tell me, as a talent manager, how many of your clients actually have talent?

Character 2: Ooh, starting with the tough questions, huh? Look, I'd say about, um, seventy percent have genuine ability, but the other thirty percent have something arguably more valuable—they're coachable and they show up every single day ready to work.

Character 1: Thirty percent with no talent? That's practically fraud.

Character 2: Well okay, so here's the thing about talent—it's not always obvious at first. I've seen people who seemed completely hopeless turn into, uh, absolute powerhouses after eighteen months of proper development and guidance, you know?

Character 1: [very loudly] But surely you must secretly laugh at the hopeless ones?

Character 2: Honestly? Never. The ones who struggle initially often become the most dedicated performers because they, mmm, they understand what it takes to improve. They've earned every bit of success through pure determination.

Character 1: Come now, you must have a bottom five percent you'd love to fire.

Character 2: [delighted] Ha! You're really trying to get me to admit something terrible here! Yeah so, the truth is, the only clients I'd ever consider dropping are the ones who don't respect other people's time—that's way worse than lacking natural ability.

Character 1: [whispering] What about the delusional ones who think they're the next big thing?

Character 2: Oh gosh, those are actually my favorites to work with. That confidence, even when it's, err, slightly misplaced, can be channeled into real stage presence once we add some actual skills to back it up.

Character 1: [confidently] I bet you have a secret ranking system for who's worth your time.

Character 2: Alright so, I mean, everyone in this business mentally categorizes clients to some degree, but it's not about worth—it's more like, um, figuring out who needs what kind of support and when they need it most, you know?

Character 1: Do you charge the untalented ones more since they need extra help?

Character 2: Woof, that would be pretty unethical, wouldn't it? My rates are based on time and expertise required, not on someone's starting point—though I'll admit the challenging cases often become the most rewarding both personally and, uh, financially over time.

Character 1: [chuckle] What percentage secretly hate you for being honest about their limitations?

Character 2: [short pause] Maybe five percent initially feel that sting, but here's the thing—brutal honesty delivered with genuine care is what separates good managers from the ones who just, mmm, collect commissions and enable delusions.

Character 1: How many clients have fired you for crushing their dreams?

Character 2: Three in fifteen years, and honestly, those were blessings in disguise. If someone can't handle constructive feedback about their craft, they're, err, definitely not ready for what critics and audiences will throw at them.

Character 1: What's your success rate for turning nobodies into somebodies?

Character 2: Well look, if we're talking real, sustainable careers? About one in twelve make it to that level, but—and this is important—literally everyone who sticks with the program for two years sees measurable improvement in their craft and confidence.
