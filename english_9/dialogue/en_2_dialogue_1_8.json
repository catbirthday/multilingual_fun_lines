Most people just assume it's all manipulation and evil corporations, but you're right that there's, like, real potential to use these insights for good—helping people avoid impulse purchases or, hmm, recognize when they're being influenced by emotions rather than logic."

            "content": "Mmm, yes, I've actually been pushing for exactly that kind of education for years now, and it's, er, it's slowly gaining traction. The thing is, once people understand concepts like anchoring bias or the decoy effect, they become way more resistant to manipulation and can, you know, make choices that actually align with their real values."

I've seen companies completely transform their approach once they realize that, uhh, that helping customers make good decisions actually builds way more loyalty than tricking them ever could."

But talking to you reminds me that, uhh, that there really are people out there who want to use knowledge for good and believe in, I mean, in creating a better world."
