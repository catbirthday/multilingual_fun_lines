=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shaky voice] The polls are down three points. Three whole points in two days.

Character 2: [warm] Listen—those numbers? They're noise, static, temporary turbulence in what is fundamentally a winning trajectory. We've weathered worse storms than this; remember New Hampshire?

Character 1: But the momentum feels different this time.

Character 2: [warm] Momentum is perception dressed up as physics, my friend. What matters—what actually matters—is ground game, donor confidence, message discipline. All three? Still rock solid.

Character 1: How can you be so calm about this?

Character 2: Because panic is expensive; it costs votes, costs volunteers, costs everything we've built. I've run seventeen campaigns—won fourteen—and every single one had this exact moment of doubt.

Character 1: What if the attack ads are actually working?

Character 2: Attack ads work when we let them work, when we play defense instead of offense. Tomorrow morning: new spot drops, completely changes the conversation—boom—we're back on our narrative.

Character 1: You've already cut the response ad?

Character 2: [laugh hard] Cut it? We filmed three versions yesterday! Different tones, different approaches—A/B testing as we speak to see which one makes suburban voters lean forward in their chairs.

Character 1: Three versions? When do you even sleep?

Character 2: Sleep is... negotiable. Coffee is not. Look, this job isn't about rest; it's about rhythm—knowing when to push, when to pull, when to let the other side exhaust themselves.

Character 1: The donors are getting nervous though.

Character 2: [fast] Donors always get nervous—it's their default setting—but they'll calm down when they see tomorrow's internals showing us up two in the suburbs and holding steady with independents.

Character 1: Wait, we're up in the suburbs?

Character 2: [slowly] We've been up... in the suburbs... for three weeks straight. You've been so focused on the topline numbers you missed the crosstabs telling the real story.

Character 1: Why didn't you tell me?

Character 2: Because you needed to feel the pressure, needed to stay hungry. Comfortable candidates make mistakes; worried candidates stay sharp—and sharp is exactly what we need right now.

Character 1: So this whole panic was calculated?

Character 2: Not calculated—calibrated. There's a difference. I don't manufacture crises; I just... choose which data points to emphasize and when to emphasize them for maximum effect.
