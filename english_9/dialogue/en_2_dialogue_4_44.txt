=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I got my first peer review back today on my research paper.

Character 2: [formal] Oh, how did it go? I know those first reviews can be, um, pretty overwhelming. Are you feeling okay about the feedback you received, or is it one of those situations where they basically tore everything apart?

Character 1: They suggested I cut my entire introduction. Three months of work.

Character 2: Ahh, okay, wait wait wait. Before you throw it all out, let's think about this for a second. Sometimes reviewers say "cut" when they really mean "reshape" or "relocate," you know? I've learned to always preserve my original drafts because, honestly, half the time you end up needing pieces of them later.

Character 1: You think I should keep it?

Character 2: Absolutely, yeah. Look, here's what I do - I create this document called "murdered darlings" where I, uh, basically paste everything that gets cut. And I swear, like seventy percent of that stuff finds its way back into either the same paper or, you know, becomes the seed for something else entirely.

Character 1: That's actually really smart. But they seemed pretty adamant.

Character 2: [cry loudly] I know, I know! God, the first time someone told me to scrap my methodology section I literally sobbed in my advisor's office! But listen, preserving your work isn't about being stubborn, it's about recognizing that, mmm, sometimes good ideas just need different contexts.

Character 1: Did you end up using that methodology section?

Character 2: Ha, actually yes! Not in that paper, but, uh, about six months later I was writing a grant proposal and suddenly that "unusable" methodology was exactly what I needed. That's why I'm kind of obsessive about archiving everything now.

Character 1: How do you organize all of it?

Character 2: Oh man, okay so, I have this whole system. Every draft gets numbered, every peer review gets its own folder, and I keep this running document where I, er, track which suggestions I implemented and which ones I decided to, you know, respectfully ignore.

Character 1: You ignore peer review suggestions?

Character 2: Well, not ignore exactly, but... look, peer review is subjective, right? Sometimes you get conflicting advice from different reviewers, and you have to make judgment calls about what to preserve from your original vision versus what genuinely needs changing.

Character 1: That makes sense. Mine all seemed to agree though.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, when there's consensus it's usually worth paying attention. But even then, I'd say preserve everything first, then make your cuts. Like, literally save a new version before you delete a single word, because you never know when you'll think "wait, actually that transition was perfect."

Character 1: You really don't throw anything away, do you?

Character 2: Honestly? No, I really don't. I have drafts from five years ago that I still reference sometimes, and, uh, it's saved me countless hours. Plus there's something kind of comforting about being able to trace your thinking back through all those versions.

Character 1: [sniffle] Sorry, I'm just really attached to that introduction.

Character 2: Oh, hey, that's completely normal! Being attached to your work is, like, part of what makes you a good researcher. Just remember that preserving it doesn't mean being precious about it - it means giving yourself options, and honestly, future you will thank present you for keeping everything.
