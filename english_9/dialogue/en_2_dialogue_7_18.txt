=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confidently] I need to refinance my house but my credit score just dropped 50 points.

Character 2: Oh, okay, well that's... that's definitely something we can work with. Um, credit scores fluctuate all the time, you know? And honestly, a 50-point drop isn't necessarily a deal-breaker—it really depends on where you started from and, uh, what actually caused the drop in the first place.

Character 1: I missed a car payment three months ago.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, I see. So one missed payment, that's actually... well, it's not ideal, obviously, but it's way better than multiple missed payments or, like, a default or something. Most lenders are gonna want to see at least three months of on-time payments after that, which, hey, sounds like you're already there, right?

Character 1: Is my rate going to be terrible now?

Character 2: Ehhh, not necessarily terrible, but it'll probably be, um, maybe a quarter to half a percentage point higher than what you'd get with perfect credit? But look, there are ways we can potentially offset that—like if you've got significant equity in the home or, uh, if you're willing to buy points upfront.

Character 1: How much equity do I need?

Character 2: Well, ideally we're looking at, mmm, at least 20% equity to avoid PMI, but honestly, with the missed payment situation, some lenders might want to see closer to 25 or even 30% to give you their best rates. It's kind of... it's basically their way of reducing risk, you know?

Character 1: [quickly] What if I only have 15%?

Character 2: Ooh, okay, so 15% is... it's doable, but you're gonna be looking at PMI for sure, which, ugh, nobody loves paying that. But here's the thing—if your home's value has gone up since you bought it, we could potentially order a new appraisal and, um, maybe squeeze out a bit more equity that way?

Character 1: How much does PMI cost?

Character 2: Gosh, it really varies, but typically you're looking at, errr, somewhere between half a percent to one percent of your loan amount annually? So like, on a $300,000 loan, that's maybe $125 to $250 per month, which I know sounds like a lot, but it automatically drops off once you hit that 20% equity mark.

Character 1: [mumbling] That's more than I was expecting.

Character 2: Yeah, I get it, it's... it's frustrating. But wait, let me actually pull up some alternative programs here because, um, there might be some lender-paid PMI options where they basically bake it into a slightly higher rate instead of a separate monthly payment, which some people find easier to swallow.

Character 1: [whispering] My spouse doesn't know about the missed payment.

Character 2: Oh. Ohhhh, okay, that's... well, that complicates things a bit because if they're on the mortgage too, we're gonna need both credit reports for the refi application. And, uh, honestly? These things have a way of coming out during the process anyway, so maybe it's better to have that conversation sooner rather than later?

Character 1: Can we just use my credit?

Character 2: [upset] Unfortunately no, that's not... if both of you are on the current mortgage, most lenders are going to require both of you on the new one too. And even if we could remove them—which, yikes, that's a whole other process—we'd only be able to use your income for qualification, which might really limit what you can borrow.

Character 1: [confused] So what are my actual options here?

Character 2: Okay, so realistically? You've got three paths: wait another few months for your credit to recover a bit more, which, mmm, might get you better terms; apply now and just accept the higher rate; or—and this is probably the smartest move—let me shop around with multiple lenders because some are way more forgiving about isolated credit hiccups than others.
