=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're telling me you can't even get out of bed before noon anymore?

Character 2: Uh, well, it's not that simple, okay? I mean, I've been trying but there's just this, like, weight that makes everything feel completely pointless lately, you know?

Character 1: Weight. Right. When did you become so weak?

Character 2: Sheesh, that's harsh. Look, I'm not weak, I'm just... I guess I'm stuck in this cycle where nothing I do seems to matter anyway, so why even bother starting?

Character 1: [chuckle] You sound exactly like my brother before he dropped out.

Character 2: Oh great, so now you're comparing me to— wait, actually, what happened with him? Did he, um, did he ever figure it out or is he still struggling with motivation stuff?

Character 1: He's washing dishes at thirty-five and living in our parents' basement. That what you want?

Character 2: Mmm, obviously not, but it's not like I'm choosing to feel this way. Sometimes your brain just, er, doesn't produce the right chemicals or whatever and suddenly everything that used to matter just... doesn't.

Character 1: Your brain? You're blaming your brain now?

Character 2: [angry] Yes, I'm blaming my brain because that's literally where motivation comes from! God, you act like I can just flip a switch and suddenly care about things again when it's actually, like, a legitimate psychological issue that millions of people deal with!

Character 1: Millions of people also get over it. What's your excuse?

Character 2: My excuse? Jeez, I don't know, maybe the fact that every strategy I try feels like I'm just, um, going through the motions? Exercise, meditation, therapy—I've tried it all and nothing actually sticks.

Character 1: [speeding up] Stop listing things you've failed at and tell me one thing you actually want.

Character 2: I want to... hm, I want to feel excited about something again. Like, remember when we used to stay up all night working on that app idea and it felt like we were actually building something that mattered?

Character 1: That was three years ago. You're still living in the past?

Character 2: No, I'm not living in the past, I'm just trying to explain what motivation actually felt like when I had it. Right now everything feels, I guess, gray and flat and exhausting before I even start.

Character 1: So what, you're waiting for colors to magically return?

Character 2: Oof, when you put it like that... Actually, yeah, maybe I am waiting for something external to, er, fix this when really I need to just start doing things even though they feel meaningless?

Character 1: Finally. Took you long enough to get there.

Character 2: [overly polite] Well thank you so much for your gentle and compassionate guidance through this difficult time. Really, your empathy has been absolutely overwhelming and I'm just, um, so grateful for your delicate approach to my mental health struggles.
