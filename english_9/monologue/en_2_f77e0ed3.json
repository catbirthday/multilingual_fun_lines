Everything. \n\n[slowly] But then I called Mom to tell her, and she was so quiet. She just said \"that's wonderful, honey\" in that voice she uses when she's trying not to cry. [sad] And Dad, he couldn't even come to the phone because his arthritis was acting up again. [shaky voice] They need me here. They're getting older and I'm—I'm their only kid who stayed close. [sigh]\n\nMom keeps saying they'll be fine, that I should go, but she's, um... she's forgetting things lately. Little things. [anxious] Like she called me three times yesterday asking if I was coming for dinner. [pause] And Dad can barely drive anymore. \n\n[frustrated] Why does it have to be Copenhagen?
