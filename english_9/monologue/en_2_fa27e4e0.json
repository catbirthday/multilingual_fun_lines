[shaky voice] I keep reading the letter over and over because I can't quite believe it's real. [pause] Twenty-three years I've been cutting stone, and this is—well, this is everything I've worked for, isn't it?\n\n[very quietly] My grandfather taught me this craft. [emotional] He used to say that stone remembers everything, that our marks become, um... become part of history. [sniffle] And now my hands, these hands that he guided, they're going to create something that'll stand for, what, centuries? [overwhelmed] Heroes' names carved into my work. [pause] Families will come here to remember, to touch the stone and feel... I don't know, connected to something bigger.\n\n[anxiously] The weight of it is, err, it's hitting me now. [deep breath] This isn't just another commission, is it? [contemplative] Every chisel mark has to be perfect because it's not just stone anymore—it's memory, it's honor, it's... [voice breaking] God, those families deserve the absolute best I can give. \n\n[determined] I'll pour everything into this. [passionately] Every technique my grandfather taught me, every lesson learned from thirty years of mistakes and triumphs. [very sincerely] This memorial will be my greatest work, because it has to be. [choking up] These heroes, they gave everything. [whispered] The least I can do is make sure they're remembered properly."
