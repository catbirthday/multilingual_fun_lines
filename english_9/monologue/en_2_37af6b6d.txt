=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [excited] God, I still can't believe we got nominated. [pause] Everyone keeps asking about the director, the cinematography, but that scene—the one where she whispers goodbye to her daughter—that's all Grandpa. [warm] He taught me to hold the boom like it was breathing, you know? Not rigid, just... alive. [chuckle] He'd make me practice with a broomstick in his garage for hours. [very sincerely] "Feel the actor's rhythm, not just their words," he'd say. [pause] And during that take, I remembered how he'd, um, how he'd close his eyes and just listen to the room's heartbeat. [emotional] The way the fabric rustled when she leaned in, that tiny catch in her breath—I got it all because I wasn't chasing the dialogue. [proudly] I was dancing with it. [sigh] He died two years before we started filming. [very quietly] Never got to see me work on a real set. [pause] But in that moment, holding that boom exactly how he taught me, feeling the weight distribute through my shoulders... [crying while speaking] he was right there with me. [relieved] And now the whole world gets to hear what he heard—that perfect, honest silence between words where everything lives.
