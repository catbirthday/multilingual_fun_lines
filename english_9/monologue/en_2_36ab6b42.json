The... the restructuring without support systems. [very quietly] I remember Sarah from accounting asked about mental health resources and I said we'd... we'd revisit it next quarter. [long pause] \n\nJesus Christ, I—these were people. Real people with families and... [upset] And I sat in that boardroom talking about efficiency metrics while they were, um... while they were drowning. [regretful] I kept saying we needed to push harder, that everyone just needed to adapt to the new pace. Marcus sent that email about burnout and I... I called it \"growing pains.\" [pause] Growing pains. [very sad] Three people are dead because I thought their suffering was just, what, collateral damage?\n\n[anxious] How do you even—how do you come back from something like this? I mean, I can't undo it. [crying while speaking] I can't bring them back. Every decision I made, every cost I cut, every time I said no to their requests for help... [pause] Their names. I need to know their names. [very quietly] Because they weren't just employee numbers. They were never just numbers."
