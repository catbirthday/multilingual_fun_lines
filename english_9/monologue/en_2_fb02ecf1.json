We should do that again soon. [pause] Really soon. [cheerful] Hey, who needs another drink? I'm making my famous terrible margaritas that everyone pretends to like! [playful] Come on, Sarah, you know you want one. [warm] You guys are seriously the best, you know that? Like, I mean it. [sigh] Every single one of you idiots. [quickly] Okay, picture time!
