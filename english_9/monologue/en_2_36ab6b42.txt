Subject: Learning that your CEO decisions led to three employee suicides that could have been prevented

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Three? There were... there were three of them? [shaky voice] I don't—wait, what do you mean "could have been prevented"? [pause] Oh God. The overtime mandate. The... the restructuring without support systems. [very quietly] I remember Sarah from accounting asked about mental health resources and I said we'd... we'd revisit it next quarter. [long pause] 

Jesus Christ, I—these were people. Real people with families and... [upset] And I sat in that boardroom talking about efficiency metrics while they were, um... while they were drowning. [regretful] I kept saying we needed to push harder, that everyone just needed to adapt to the new pace. Marcus sent that email about burnout and I... I called it "growing pains." [pause] Growing pains. [very sad] Three people are dead because I thought their suffering was just, what, collateral damage?

[anxious] How do you even—how do you come back from something like this? I mean, I can't undo it. [crying while speaking] I can't bring them back. Every decision I made, every cost I cut, every time I said no to their requests for help... [pause] Their names. I need to know their names. [very quietly] Because they weren't just employee numbers. They were never just numbers.
