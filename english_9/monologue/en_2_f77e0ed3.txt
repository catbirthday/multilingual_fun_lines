Subject: Being offered your dream fellowship but having to move away from your aging parents

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: They called this morning. The fellowship in Copenhagen—the one I've been dreaming about since grad school. [excited] I got it! Three years, fully funded, working with the exact team I wanted. [pause] My hands were literally shaking when I read the email. [happy] This is everything I've worked for, you know? Everything. 

[slowly] But then I called Mom to tell her, and she was so quiet. She just said "that's wonderful, honey" in that voice she uses when she's trying not to cry. [sad] And Dad, he couldn't even come to the phone because his arthritis was acting up again. [shaky voice] They need me here. They're getting older and I'm—I'm their only kid who stayed close. [sigh]

Mom keeps saying they'll be fine, that I should go, but she's, um... she's forgetting things lately. Little things. [anxious] Like she called me three times yesterday asking if I was coming for dinner. [pause] And Dad can barely drive anymore. 

[frustrated] Why does it have to be Copenhagen? Why couldn't it be here? [quietly] I know that's stupid, I know this is incredible, but I just— [trailing off]

[very sad] How am I supposed to choose between my future and the people who gave me everything?
