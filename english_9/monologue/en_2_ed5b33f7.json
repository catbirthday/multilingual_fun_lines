She got the acceptance letter today!\" [pause] Like I didn't already see it on Instagram. [quietly] The same program. Harvard. The exact same one that... [sigh] that told me twice I wasn't good enough. [frustrated] God, I mean, I'm happy for her, I am. She worked hard, she deserves it. [shaky voice] But it's just, um... it's really hard not to feel like— [pause] What did she have that I didn't? [upset] We had the same GPA, similar research experience. Actually, no, I had MORE research experience. [angry] Two years more! [long pause] And everyone's going to be calling me now. [mocking] \"Oh, you must be so proud of Emma!\" [bitter laugh] Yeah. Yeah, I'm thrilled. [very quietly] She's twenty-three. I'm twenty-eight and working at a job I hate because those rejection letters made me think I wasn't smart enough for academia. [crying while speaking] And now my baby sister just... walked right in. [sniffle] I coached her through her application essays. [regretful] I gave her all my practice materials. I basically— [voice breaking] I basically trained my replacement, didn't I? [exhausted] God, I don't even know how I'm going to face Thanksgiving."
