The person who fakes phone calls to avoid confrontation, who takes the long way around just to avoid the aggressive neighbor's dog. [pause] Everyone always joked about me being the \"unlikely hero\" type, you know? Like it was this funny contradiction because I'm so obviously not brave. [laugh] But when I saw that kid in the water, I didn't even think, I just— I just jumped. My shoes are still somewhere at the bottom of that lake. [very quietly] God, I was so scared. The water was freezing and I couldn't see anything and for a second I thought we were both going to... [trailing off] But we didn't. We made it out. [slowly] And his mom, she kept saying \"thank you\" over and over and I didn't know what to do with my hands. [pause] I guess, um... I guess maybe those labels we give ourselves aren't as fixed as we think? [warm] Because today, for like five minutes, I wasn't the person who runs away. I was the person who jumped in. [sigh] My therapist is going to have a field day with this."
