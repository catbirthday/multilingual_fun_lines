Subject: Your freight forwarder logistics preventing a medical supply shortage during the emergency

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] Three thousand ventilators stuck in customs, and we've got hospitals calling every five minutes. Okay, okay, I can fix this. [quickly] Let me pull up the manifest again— wait, that's not right. These were supposed to clear yesterday. [frustrated] Why is nobody answering at the port authority? Come on, come on... 

[relieved] Finally! Yes, hi, this is urgent medical freight, authorization code— yes, I'll hold. [sigh] 

[determined] Look, I don't care if it's after hours. People are literally dying. We need those supplies moving now. Not tomorrow morning, now. [passionately] I've got seventeen hospitals waiting on this shipment, and I'm not— I'm not letting them down.

[pause] 

[confidently] Good. Thank you. Yes, I'll coordinate the trucks myself if I have to. 

[exhausted] God, this is... this is what, the fourth crisis this week? But we're making it work. [empathetically] Every shipment we push through, that's someone's parent, someone's kid getting the care they need. That's, um... that's what keeps me going when it gets this insane.

[warm] Alright, trucks are rolling. ETA four hours to the first hospital. [chuckle] We did it again, team. Against all odds, we actually did it again.
