Subject: Your bakery counter job just cut your hours in half right before the holidays when you need money most

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [upset] Twenty hours. They're giving me twenty hours a week. Right before Christmas, are you kidding me? [pause] I literally just—I can't even process this. Martha just pulled me aside after my shift and was like, "Oh, we need to talk about scheduling," and I thought, okay, maybe they're giving me more hours for the holidays, right? Because that's what makes sense. [bitter] But no. No, apparently business is "slower than expected" or whatever. [sigh] 

I've got, um... I've got rent due in two weeks. And my sister's kids, I already bought—well, I put their presents on my credit card because I thought I'd have the money. [anxious] How am I supposed to tell them I can't... I mean, what am I even going to do here? 

[frustrated] Six months I've been working there. Six months of opening at five AM, dealing with the morning rush, never calling out sick. And this is what I get? [pause] Maybe I should, I don't know, try to pick up shifts at that coffee place down the street? But they're probably not hiring until after New Year's. 

[very sad] God, I was actually looking forward to the holidays this year. [sigh] I'm such an idiot.
