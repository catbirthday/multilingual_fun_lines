[pause] The Brennan family filed a formal complaint about... about how I delivered Mrs. Brennan's Alzheimer's diagnosis. [regretful] I keep replaying it in my head and I—I know I messed up. [sigh] The thing is, I was running behind that day, you know? Three back-to-back consultations, and I just... [trailing off] I shouldn't have been so blunt. [very sad] \"Your mother has Alzheimer's and it's progressing rapidly\"—who says it like that? [frustrated] But they kept asking me to just tell them straight, no sugarcoating, so I thought— [pause] No, that's not an excuse. [quietly] Her daughter started crying and I just, um... I just kept talking about treatment options like I didn't even notice. [shaky voice] Twenty-three years of practice and I forgot the most basic thing—compassion. [worried] What if they, erhm, what if they escalate this to the medical board? [speaking fast] I mean, technically I didn't do anything wrong medically, the diagnosis was correct, but the delivery was just... [groan] God, I can still see their faces. [very quietly] I became exactly the kind of doctor I swore I'd never be."
