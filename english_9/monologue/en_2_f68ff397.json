Her friend asking how the \"project\" was going. That's what she called me. A project. [bitter] Three months of dinners and late night talks and she's giving her friend updates on how much she thinks she can get out of me. [pause] The weird thing is, I'm not even that rich, you know? Like, comfortable, sure, but not... [trailing off] \n\n[sad] I keep thinking about Tuesday when she held my hand at the hospital. My mom's surgery. She stayed the whole time. Was that— was that part of it too? [shaky voice] Because it felt real. It felt so real. When she cried with me in the parking lot, I thought... [sigh] \n\nGod, I'm an idiot. [frustrated] All those little comments about her student loans, her car breaking down. I wanted to help because I, um... because I loved her. [very quietly] Still do, actually. That's the pathetic part. [short pause] I know what she is now, I've seen the proof, and my stupid heart is still doing that thing when I think about her laugh. When she does that little nose scrunch. [regretful] Was any of it real for her? Even a little bit?\n\n[exhausted] I have to end it. Obviously. But how do you break up with someone for breaking your heart when they never even knew they had it?"
