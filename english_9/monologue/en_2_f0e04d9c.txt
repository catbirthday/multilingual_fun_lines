Subject: Your banquet planning raising enough funds to keep the animal shelter open for another five years

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I can't believe we actually did it. Five years. The shelter's safe for five whole years. [extremely happy] When they told me the final count from the banquet, I just... I had to sit down. [laugh] Four hundred and twenty thousand dollars! I mean, I knew we'd sold all the tickets, but with the auction and everything... [pause] God, when Mrs. Henderson bid thirty grand on that weekend in Aspen, I thought I was going to pass out.

[relieved] You know what's funny? I was so worried about the catering falling through last minute. Like, that was my biggest fear—that the food would be terrible and everyone would, um... everyone would leave early or something. [chuckle] But then the shelter dogs doing that little parade in bow ties? [warm] That wasn't even planned, that was Sarah's last-minute idea. And people just melted. I saw grown men crying. [sniffle] 

Honestly, when we started planning this thing six months ago, I thought maybe—maybe we'd raise enough for one year? [emotional] But five years means those animals are safe. [cry] No more wondering if we'll have to close next month. No more turning dogs away because we can't afford food. [extremely happy] We can actually help them all now!
