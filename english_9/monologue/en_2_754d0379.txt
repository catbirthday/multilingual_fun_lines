Subject: Your optimist philosophy helped everyone around you through the crisis while leaving you emotionally depleted and secretly despairing

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] Everyone keeps thanking me. "You got us through this," they say. "Your positivity saved us." And I just... I smile and nod because what else can I do? [bitter] Tell them the truth? That every morning I wake up and have to, um, physically force myself to get out of bed? That I've been saying "it'll all work out" so many times I don't even know what the words mean anymore? [sigh] 

I became this—this emotional support system for everyone. My sister calls crying, I'm there with solutions. My coworkers panic, I'm the voice of reason. "Stay strong," I tell them. "We'll get through this together." [very quietly] But who's telling me that? 

The worst part is, erm, I'm actually really good at it. I know exactly what to say to make people feel better. I've got this whole routine down—the reassuring tone, the little jokes, the perfectly timed "everything happens for a reason." [laugh] God, I hate that phrase now. 

[very sad] Sometimes I sit in my car after work and just... can't move. Like, I've used up every last bit of hope I had on other people, and there's nothing—absolutely nothing—left for me. [crying while speaking] But tomorrow I'll do it all over again because that's who I am now. The optimist. The strong one.
