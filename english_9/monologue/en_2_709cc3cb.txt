Subject: Your DNA analysis just revealed your father isn't your biological father

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Twenty-three percent. That's what it says. Twenty-three percent match with Dad. [confused] That can't be right, that's not—that's not how it works. [pause] You share fifty percent with your parents, not... not twenty-three. [shaky voice] Oh my God. Oh my God, this is actually happening. [pause] Mom lied to me? For thirty-two years, she just... what, pretended? And Dad, does he—does he even know? [angry] How could she do this to us? All those times she talked about honesty, about trust being the foundation of—[laugh] God, what a joke. [pause] Wait, so who... who is my actual father then? Is he, um... is he even alive? Does he know I exist? [very sad] Everything feels different now. Like, all those memories of Dad teaching me to ride a bike, or when he'd call me his "little scientist" because I loved those chemistry sets... [sniffle] Was that all fake? No, that's—that's not fair, he raised me. He IS my dad. But also he's... he's not. [hesitantly] I don't know what to do with this. Do I tell him? Do I tell Mom that I know? [exhausted] I can't just pretend I never saw this. But I also can't imagine having that conversation.
